ALONE It's become extremely violent. It can be considered a war. I never saw the like in Vietnam, nor in Algeria, it's totally unbelievable. There are scenes of fighting and warfare. There is no other way. Ambulances can no longer go in. The men are holding on behind barricades. It's getting closer and closer. Just a few feet away, the police are fighting back with stun and fragmentation grenades. It's nothing to do with the monarchy. He jumps on the publicity bandwagon, using April 30, the denouement in Amsterdam, but it's nothing to do with the principle of the monarchy. To such an extent that small Republican groups are joining demonstrations far from the palace. The Dutch now realise that something's not right, something's gone wrong. The Dutch youth is primarily concerned about the housing situation, which indicates there's a deadlock. There's a particularity with Amsterdam as Amsterdam has always considered itself separate from the rest of Holland. It is now openly said that the monarchy clearly illustrates this particularity. That is what we've always said. And through this, we can tell how the monarchy is going to be challenged concerning the housing problem. It's the main issue for today's youth. That doesn't only concern the people of Amsterdam... Hey, Lucio! It's the last one. It's English. Catch! I forgot to plug in the fridge. Gosh, Adjani! You look rough! What? I look rough? You're here late. I'm cooking some sausage for my dinner to go with a salad I've prepared. You eat early. I've something to show you. You still have Mum's box? - What box? - With photos and souvenirs. Of course I've kept it, it's all that's left. It'll be yours one day. Go get it. I've a surprise. What is this? Look. Unbelievable! I'd swear it's Elise. How do you know her? I don't, I found it. Someone left it in a photo booth. She's a... what's the word? A spitting image. That's it. A spitting image. It's knocked me for six. I'll just sit down. It knocked me for six too. You should find her and show her. She'd be amazed. You might like her. I could call her "Mum". No... Why do you say that? She's surely a modern young woman. Your mother loved the mountains. She lived for them. She climbed so many with your father. She had to stop after having you... her heart. I was bad timing. That's enough nonsense. She wanted you so badly. You were her ray of sunshine. Poor thing, she fell ill just after having you. She didn't even have the time to enjoy you. It was so sudden, it took her in 3 weeks. The doctor couldn't do anything. They didn't know much about her illness back then. You died of it. Sit down. Eau de vie's better for my stomach. Have you eaten? No. I'm taking you to the restaurant, it's Thursday. Out of the question! I never spend money. I don't have many opportunities, I'll invite you! Here's the money. Men pay, it's normal. I'll get my jacket, it'll be chilly later. Go on, my knee slows me down. Can I look in the box? Of course. And I've told you, it'll come to you when I die. Why do I always mess up with women? Do you know why? You're self-confident, but you've got to work at relationships. It's like you do everything to break them up. That's just you. Your father was the same. A real skylark. A skylark? Silly billy! What are you going to do? Go and see Adrien while I'm here. - No, I mean... - Do you smell that? Isn't it beautiful? Adrien? Adrien? Hi, Adrien. How are you? Yeah, right... Get another drink and we'll have some fun. Never mind, do as you want. I don't want to screw, I'm not into girls. You getting another bottle? OK. Another bottle! Hey, Grandad! Let's drink before... I said, no screwing. Are you really pregnant? Yes. You're repeating yourself. Yes, I am. You made love with another. - Differently. - Hogwash! That's my business. You can't use love. You can. You see? Don't you like children? I'd like a big boy like you. You want to be this lady's son? Loser! She loves herself enough to reproduce. I envy her. Bastard! You said you didn't want this child. To fill your loneliness? Yours encourages me! Leave me. No! I love you. You love yourself. Yes, I love myself pregnant. You imagine me as a dad? A child is like poison. Where are the toilets? Over there. You hear that? Poison. That's what the orphan said. Coward! Bastard! Curtain down on the divided couple. Liliane, how much do I owe you? - 40. And that guy's drinks? - On me. - He's throwing up! - And I have to clean it up! - Who is that guy? - A friend. We're taking him with us. One child replaces another. Not yet. We'll see. I'm keeping it. Him, yes. Me, we'll see. I love you, Ludovic. You are my prison. I love you. What am I doing here? The sea air is healing you. Why am I here? You threw up and the barmaid didn't know what to do with you. You should've left me in the street. Sorry, what's your name? I'm Ludovic. A non-productive painter. I'm also an amateur filmmaker. I film... I stop time. I no longer know what this world is made of. I perfect how I see things. You film people? Things. Where are we going? On that island, just off the mainland. We're almost there. The sea passage is narrow but... - Is it yours? - No, a dog's. He means it's his boss's, the one who pays him. I mean, a dog. Gently. Hey, you OK? Marie and I never talked about kids. - Marie? - Yes. My friend. Has been for a long time. That's her. - Beautiful, isn't she? - Yes. It's hard to see in the dark. But invite her, we'll have a party. I have the key. She's right, we'll have a party. We'll see what kind. I'll try to reach her. It's difficult. You're very kind. How awful! No... Lucienne's violent and I'm cruel. But we like people... Often. It's empty because they're scared of mess. They think an artist dirties everything he touches. There's water here. It's a strange place, you'll see. Careful of the furniture. There are no more lights. We usually just pass through here. - What's your name? - Jean. Goodnight, Jean. Tell me... What? Would you have a child? I don't know. I'm barely out of childhood myself. I feel the need to be a mother. "A woman's life force pushes her to give life so strongly "she aims to resurrect, inside herself, "the childhood of the man she desires." How he replies to me! Reciting what he knows. He doesn't want to learn with me. He hates "us". He's afraid of undermining our relationship. He speaks to you with tenderness. It's his way of not wanting to be an adult. You'll be cold! I've drunk too much to be cold. One can never drink enough. One should drink until one dies. The trouble is one dies of it. Goodnight. Are you coming? Tonight. Afterwards, who knows. I shouldn't sing. Life no longer smiles at me. What bothers me is how helpless I am. Even about this child you want. Yet I'm not selfish. You hide behind your generosity. You talk to your friends about me, paint true pictures of me. You are my first and last model. I'm exhausted observing you, examining the passage of time. After official hours? Can we live without the money? Without money. You can live without me. I work to tire myself out. So you can see me tired. So that we're tired together. Out of love. Your tiredness is... inaccessible. Mine is... simpler, direct. Physically. You're so beautiful when you're exhausted. I'm full of hope. Exhausted and full of hope. I'm incapable of the slightest movement. Yes, I can light a match for the noise... Listen. No more cigarettes. I'm distracted. Let's go inside. Are you coming? No, I'm going to babble alone. Heavens above! Sleep on guard. I'm sorry. Why? I didn't know... I thought I was alone. You are. I'm Carole. I don't have a bath. Ludovic is my friend. And you? I must go. Where? I don't know. You don't know where you're going? I'll stay for the party. A party? No one told me. It's done. Jean. Carole. We found her in a bar, like you. You want to work today? Dangerous. The more I work with you, the more I doubt myself. I like Carole as a model. She carefully provokes me. She's a passing flame. Meet me in the studio? No, today is bath day. And Marie? I'll call her. Let her know. We don't entertain much. I count on strangers for scandal. - Why... - Peaceful parties are boring. It's chaos out there. So why not in here? May I speak as a friend? You may! What do you want? I'm looking at the sketch of you. And? It resembles you. What do you know? You like your own image? I need it to recognise myself. How others see you isn't enough? You can drop formalities. Men don't look at me. They scrutinise me like a piece of meat. They see my arse, my breasts... Women avoid my eyes, they're wary. I like the drawings. They stay on the surface. What are you going to do, Ludovic? Duration! I try to contain duration on paper. You know I've invited Laval? And the paintings you owe him? Nothing. Not yet. He'll throw us out. Most probably. He'll call the police. So will I. How could you do that? Quite simply. In bed with a man. What were you thinking? Of you! And him? He had his head in the cushions. He seemed distracted too. How merry! No, it's sad. I'm off to work. In your state? Idiot! What are you going to do, Ludovic? Nothing. I don't want this child. You've already said that. It's not an answer. It's the last unknown between us? A painting you haven't yet painted? A blank canvas isn't that bad. You're afraid. You feel old. You no longer want to talk? You're the one who's afraid. You don't want another child. You're filling a void. Bastard. You're afraid of yourself. You're doing it to occupy yourself. Bastard. Bastard. You're not answering either. You're going to lose me. It's ghastly. I know. Oh, I don't know... I'll take care of everything: Drinks, guests, music... Especially the music. I like music. You know that. Can you imagine a baby here? What's a baby like? Are you staying? I'd like to, I don't want to intrude. No, you're entertaining. Will you come with me, Jean? If you want. I'll come back with Marie. Who is Marie? His friend, his love... Hurry up! Hurry up! Will you come to the party? Will there really be one? And Marie? Marie? Your friend. Will she come? She doesn't like meeting new people. I'll try to persuade her. Do you live together? It's open. She has her life, her time, she works. You don't? Not anymore. I never learnt a manual job. We meet at night, on holiday... She likes the sea, its sound. I like Marie. This is her ID photo. So small. - She doesn't look it. - No, the photo. And you? What about me? What do you do? I... I have my life. I don't live with a man. Are you a student? I'm curious, I take notes. I have a little black book in my head. They're demolishing everything, excluding us, to earn more money, move faster. They? The wolves. You see them straight away. They dress as lambs but they're really foxes, resisting the best they can. How? With stones and bullets. Will you come for me later? - I don't have your address? - It's over there. Ludovic or Lucienne will give it to you. I'll know it if I come with you. You'll insist on staying. I have to work. I need time to be alone. What for? Time for myself. - You'll come? - For sure. Nothing's ever sure. Carole... May I touch your hair? You're so polite... I was thinking of Marie. She's lovely hair like you. I can't touch them, it annoys her. - Ludovic? - Yes? Is it time for the party? What party? - You said... - There are no parties here anymore. Sometimes friends come, a stranger turns up, or Lucienne drags up. I'm joking. Tomorrow, we have visitors: Fishermen in troubled waters come disguised. One of your films? A painting. It's Lucienne? It was Lucienne. She's not changed. The way I see her has. Did you talk to Carole? Yes. A strange girl, harsh with others. Harsher towards herself. Pure but worldly. Careful, she'll make you forget Marie. That won't be easy. Carole is eager to meet her. That's her cannibalistic side. She digests quickly then disappears. She says being young doesn't mean you know everything. She's bulimic. I've a good appetite too. I've a bolognese simmering for Lucienne. That's my mother hen side. She loves my cooking because I'm more precise at it than anything else. We got a new toy at the shop. Look, Ludovic. It walks? Great! But he should shut up during dinner. You like it? I could live on this. I've always loved pasta. As I said before, you're the ideal baby. We could adopt you. What would the child think? The same. True nature always manifests itself eventually. Children have a sharp nose. "Maternal love is the beginning "and the end of all love." You hear me, Ludovic? The beginning and the end of all love. You're sad here. I've spent many long evenings on these steps with Ludovic. He'd light a cigarette and pass it to me. The taste of Caporal shared at dusk. It was the taste of extraordinary happiness. We would dance. We were... so different. So close. The lake is deserted tonight. I feel uninhabited, as if I no longer want myself. My body needs another relationship. But not without Ludovic, that would be a betrayal. If he refuses, I leave. He wouldn't get over it, you see? I'm the one thing he loves in this world. He loves the world through me. If I disappear, he'll stop, he'll do nothing. He will stop. Quite simply stop. But the child? There is no child. I lied. To push him to the limit, to make him angry. You heard, he accepts I have... other lovers, to keep me. He loves me if he can do that. You want some tea? No, thank you. It's you? And the party? Postponed. Can I come in? My friend, Anne, is here. A cup of tea? I'd prefer coffee. Good evening, Anne. Where are you taking me? What about Marie? She's sulking. She doesn't want to get involved. You want to get involved with her? Where is she? Not far away. Sometimes she spies on me. She probably has her reasons. She says I always destroy what is dearest to me. I'm afraid. What are you hiding? Nothing. You want to dance? You know how to? Remnants of memories. What if I wanted to make love? I would like to. No. We can go to sleep together. You're serious? On my terms. Anything you want. Yes, anything I want. Shall we go? To your place? No, to the island. A mid-water zone. Ludovic is used to it. Did you think I was waiting for you? You make love with Marie, right? It's not the same. That would top it all! What a situation. What situation? I'm good, here with you. Good as gold. Is that Ludovic's shirt? No. One of Lucienne's. Shall we turn the light off? Are you sleepy? No, but I'm falling asleep. I'm not a sleeping pill. You're crazy. I'm good, that's all. You're using me. Open your eyes. Look at me. Look! Carole, this is what you wanted. I'm not asking for anything. You're cheating on me, you're thinking of Marie. Oh no. You can't know that. I've forgotten. I've lost my memory. You've got to believe me. "I've"... "I've lost"... "You've got to"... And me? I am. I don't want to sleep. We can go out. I don't know... Is it good with Marie when you make love? With her, I feel like I don't know. You're falling asleep? How do you know that? Have you loved lots of women? Yes, several. But none like Marie. We met when we were young, maybe that's why. Making love has nothing to do with childhood. You don't want to grow up. You don't want to grow up? I want you. You don't know what you want. You want to sleep? Goodnight, little guy. Ludovic? - You're here? - With Jean. He's a little lost. It's his own fault. His illness is Marie, who's not here. It's a beautiful night. Is Anne coming tomorrow? Probably. She's tense. She can feel the spring. It's a difficult time. The season of bright light. People talk of what they see. I only see clearly at night. We can build in the darkness. I won't sell your portraits. Dealers look at them obscenely. By buying a drawing of you, they want to possess you. I'll be my own hero. I'll only paint for myself. And the house? The island? They'll throw us out. In the meantime, I'll film until the camera stops. Change the battery. That won't change the world. I'm tired. If Lucienne has a child, she won't want to waste time with me. Lucienne will stay. You've done everything together. Apart from a child. The unknown. Shall we go out? Or in? I'd love to smoke a cigarette with you at sea. You? I'd smoke another one. And Jean? He'll taste it on me if he kisses me. One day, I'm sure she'll stay. She came. She doesn't know if she'll stay. She was happy with him. Maybe that's enough for her. If he insists? If he holds her back, by force? With the force of his love, maybe. Maybe she'll stay. What will they do together? Everything. They'll fight the world's disorder. They'll be like a mother and a father, like two lovers, a brother and sister, like two men, like two women, like a man and a woman united and divided. The one who can leave will stay. You can't sleep? No. The bed's too soft. - I had a dream. - Tell me about it. I can't remember it. Make an effort. There was Marie, the house covered with snow, and you. - We got on? - You were good friends. You teased me. You caressed each other as though I wasn't there. That bothers you. You don't like missing out. Men no longer have the leading role. You're not bad in yours. You want some coffee? - It's my second. - What? Coffee, that we've drunk together. You are lucky. Let's go for a drive? I can never go home. But I know the way by heart, I could go my eyes closed. Your memory is fading You don't remember very well What's he doing? His wings are broken. He's limping. Like you. Nothing's changed. Yes, it has. I'm cold. There was a port... boats... Here? You're sure? No, further along. I'm not sure, it all looks the same. Strange... There was a bridge. I saw a bridge earlier. Then it's there. Marie and I would run down each side. She'd shout intimate things to me. It surprised people. I'd shout back even louder. They thought we were shouting insults. Marie played along. At the end of the dyke, we wanted to kiss. We'd run back up. But back on the bridge, the desire had gone. We'd be thinking of something else. A long time ago? Yes, we were very young. You want to play again? You're foolish. Don't ever say that. You hear? Don't ever say that. Repeat what you said last night. I want to make love with you! Louder! I want to make... - I've lost my voice! - Try again! ...love with you! Me too. What? I didn't say anything. If she could just say "yes" right now. What did you say? Nothing. Wait for me! Breathe. I still want to. What? Kiss you. No. I do. Look... Carole... What? Wait. Tag! Marie... No, Carole! What did I say? Marie. You called me Marie. It's fantastic! Why don't you live here? It's damp... the insects... I'd be bored stiff. I'd love it! I'd install jukeboxes and pinball machines everywhere. The bastard makes me laugh. He'd be bored without us. You've said yourself: Money can't buy happiness. Come on! Here is my new whore! And her brother. He's dumb but not deaf. Don't complain. You want to buy more? It's exactly the same as being sexually desirable. Do I paint for the wealthy? You sell to those who pay. Then commission a work. I prefer you to be free. Because you've no subject, no ideas... You can't employ me, so you prefer my freedom. And if I don't leave? I'll get a badass to throw you out. How is Lucienne? I'm thirsty. Can I have a drink? Over there. She'll tell you. You like paintings? Apart from adverts, images... well... Would you like a child? Who for? For you. I don't know. That's dangerous. You should just have them, or not. I've decided. It's in my bones. It's terrible. When he's born, he'll be here. I know. I'll teach him... to leave me. I'll have lots of time. And you? What are you going to do? I'll... drift until the next port of call. You don't want to stop? I only like the journey, love... That's my solution. The fire of the earth, madam. You'll exhaust yourself. In love, I am unique. Do you exhibit? Not anytime soon. I love life too much to waste my time depicting it. - You like funny stories? - Yes. Listen... An idiot is talking about works by Braque: "You don't find that light in nature." Braque replies: "Aren't I from nature?" Don't you find that funny? Yes, you see, I'm laughing. Are you bored? Marie is coming. At last. Will you speak to her? About you? About us. There is no us. What about this morning? This morning... I kissed you. That's what she should know? I called you Marie. - So what? - I want her to know. - You want her to suffer. - I want her to know everything. But if she leaves you? She'll be at peace. You intrigue me. She's never kissed me like that. Like what? Like that. I'll tell her. I'm going to dance. Carole... What? I'm not good. Not good at all. It's not my fault. See you later. Laval! Come here! I've something to sell. - You're the art dealer? - The owner of the house. And Ludovic's work. Everything can be bought. Artists, in particular, have no morality. You have any friends? This is Marlène. Who are you? You're cute. Hands off. You want a drink? Yes! I didn't dare serve myself. She's usually the first one drunk. Did you hear? He always speaks to me like that. Kill him. See? We're of the same opinion. I'm warned. What a strange party this is. - There's nothing to drink. - Come, Marlène. I'm bored. Do we sit on the floor? Sorry, but Lucienne and I are just stowaways. He's exaggerating. This is their home. You hate me, don't you? You'll know soon enough. Oh, great! A film! A new genre? You want to sell me films now? Have you already seen it? Your friend's quiet. He's waiting for Marie. He's anxious. My painting only spoke about myself. Poor merchandise. With a camera, the light finally becomes the theme when it falls on Lucienne's hand. Fragile. The topicality of love. Difficult to appraise. Yes, difficult to appraise. She was driving. I caught my elbow in the car door. When the sun broke through, the sky darkened. We often drive like that. She drives my distraction. I catch, by chance, what we no longer see together. She says I'm afraid of the barren solitude in the mountains we are climbing. That I never stop, that I don't dream, that I have no time to waste. That I don't have time. That I haven't grasped that we don't find when we're looking. I love... Yes... I love what remains when the other has left. The trace left behind. The imprint. We watch TV. I fall asleep watching a channel. She uses the remote control to change the programme, in a rush to finish watching everything at the same time. She's thirsty and hungry. Yes. I only eat to feed myself. She is nourished by the pleasure of eating with me. My hands feel the direction to take as scissors and glue come into contact with images which don't connect in reality. The word "scissors" incites this image of blades, of knives... Should I make a cut somewhere? Where's your friend? Is he sensitive? My God! Marlène... He's gone off with her? Does he always treat you like that? I need money. I'll do anything to become someone else. I think you're great as you are. This is only half of me. I don't understand. I do, but I can't say anything. Are you here alone? I'm waiting for a friend. She hasn't come? She misses all our dates. It's her flaw. Where are you taking me? Where? Where do you want to go? I don't know the area. Any ideas? Another party? A village dance? - Would you like that? - Absolutely. - What's your name? - Jean. Mathew, Mark, Luke... Jean is the last, it's the easiest. And your brother? He follows me everywhere. He protects me. - Everyone's left. - Yes, I think so. Have you seen Jean? He seemed disappointed, Marie didn't come. You want to go out? It's over, Ludovic. I'm leaving. I've chosen. My life over ours. Will you live with the father of your child? - There's no longer a father. - Oh, he fled. There is no child, there never was. You lied to me. I had a dream. About you. About the child we'd have. Have one with another man and come back. The man I love must be the father. You're too old, it's dangerous. Shut up, you're cheating. If you give birth to a monster? You're horrible. No, I'll just try anything to save us. You're losing me even more. In love, we do whatever we want. You can't touch my determination, I prepared myself. I can hit you. Hit me. I can lock you up. Lock me up. I can kill you. Kill me. I can kill myself. No, you like life too much. I'm going to suffer. So am I. It's absurd. No. So, you're leaving. Yes, Ludovic, I'm leaving. You'll lose everything because you don't want more. It's going to be windy tonight. The weather's changing. Women have a sense of time. They are today's true heroes. Each to his own life Each to his own death Each to his turn They've overstepped the mark Pushed too far There's no more love Each to his own life His death, his turn They've overstepped the mark Pushed too far There's no more love No more love Take to the streets He had it all He lived it all And he shot off A bullet for Dad A bullet for Mum A bullet for Uncle A bullet in the ceiling There's no more love It's scorching in here. It's so clammy. I'm drenched. I don't dare touch you. Why not? I like it. I stink. What a strange word. Don't you like your smell? Smell me. I like the smell of men's sweat. No one's ever said that to me. There's a first time for everything. Look at the moon. So full! Who? The moon, idiot. Let's go for a walk? In the moonlight? Good idea. The moon keeps me awake. They shot Each other They didn't miss The two sweethearts They shot each other With just one shot Their hearts exploded Took leave of this society Till they could blow it all away You know this place? - I came with the "éclaireurs". - Eclaireurs? The scouts. A boy scout! The cap, shorts and everything. Give me your scarf. You know the scarf game? I slip it round my belt and you have to snatch it. Go on. We made it harder. We wrapped it twice round our belts. Go on, pull it out. That's not very nice. That's teenagers for you. They like to win. One evening, something strange happened. I was with a friend. We stopped right here. After a while, I don't know... The darkness... The wind... The space... I don't know... We both ended up our hands on each other's thighs. We touched each other's penises. We wanked each other off. He came. I held back, reasoning myself. Then we fled in silence... scarves between our legs. You're telling me this on purpose. Laval told you. What about? I'm not a woman. What do you mean, not a woman? You don't believe me? You want to touch me? It's all a disguise? You really want to be a woman? Yes. Men prefer me like this. They find me more feminine than others, than their own women. In short, you prefer fucking with a man? It's complicated. In fact, you can choose. I find that exciting. I hear you. I have a woman's desires, it's others who complicate things: Men who don't want to accept their feminine side. I'm in the middle, they can't accept my freedom. You're the same. You need a girl to confide your experience with a boy. You fear your lust for men. You use it to turn a woman on, to show her your feminine side that you consider a weakness. It's not surprising in a man. You want to make love? How? Anyway you want, but with love. I don't know. It's delicate. Yes. Fuck me. But make love to me afterwards. My pleasure counts too. Harsh dawn That lingers on Oh my dearest Who becomes obtuse You cling on I let go You seize me I pull away Satiated Parched Harsh dawn That lingers on Oh my dearest Who becomes obtuse Laval didn't tell me anything. You're a brave boy. Bastard. Bitch. I like you very much, you know. The bread's disgusting, the jam's disgusting. There's not enough butter. It's a bad start to the day. Can I have some more butter? And not all runny? Here, sir. That'll be 50 centimes extra. Right, add it on. Add it on. Incredible! Everyone takes the piss! - It's not his fault. - Yes, it is! If he's not happy, he should change jobs! Or kill his boss, or rob a bank! Not moan and punish us! It's time for grand speeches? Are you ashamed? I'm sorry. I'm very happy. I find you very beautiful. My arse hurts. - That will go en route. - You think so? Marie? Marie? Are you Marie? Why are you hiding? What are you doing here? Waiting for you. Well, here I am. What are you doing? I'm not feeling good. Marie came to the party yesterday. And? She's leaving. She says she's understood, that I'm afraid of leaving her. She says I should leave her, that I no longer need our relationship. You have her photo? Yes. You're crazy! Give it to me! You don't want to anymore? Ask beforehand or shut up. But I... Shut up. Look at me. Don't close your eyes. Gently. Faster. Slower. Stay. Wait. Wait! I want it all. I want to keep it all. Stay inside. Shush, my love. I love it. It's absurd, I want to laugh. Yes. Carole, you should always be with me. You constantly disappear. No, you're distrait. You're absent, it alienates me. - Why come after me? - To find myself. Why do you follow me? You don't wait for me. You don't love me, you need me. - Let me come in. - No violence. It will turn against you. Always an answer. Open the door. I can't love a man who hides from himself. You're nostalgic for a phantom. "Emma, after her first feeling of astonishment, "was eager to have the child to feel what it was like to be a mother. "But unable to spend money freely and buy a cradle "with pink silk curtains and embroidered bonnets, "she forfeited the pleasure "of her own plans that whet the appetite of motherly love, "which maybe enfeebled her affection from the start." What are you doing? Recording tapes for Anne's blind friends. They pay me for it. For reading.... For seeing, a little... I didn't imagine you with a job like that. Like what? You're so sharp-eyed... Don't look at me like that, you don't intimidate me. Like: "Woe is me!" - It's not you. - You jerk! You're the one who's blind. Did you really see Marie? Look at me! I'm here! Don't talk about Marie like that. She's the only one I've ever loved. Who is Marie, Jean? What do you want? Just the truth. A part of you. We don't know each other. We met by chance. Is that the truth, by chance? We've never been able to make love. Why? She doesn't think it's important. Did she come with others? I don't have a clue. What's it to you? I'm sure you never satisfied her. Never. It's your fault. It must often be like that. All those "Maries" disappointed. Because we can't give to you. Shut up. Only your desires count! And your sleep! Shut up! Carole, wait... Hey, kitty... Hey, kitty! Are you there? Jean? Why have you done this? Jean! Why have you done this? You're crazy! Jean! Subtitles: Louise Williams Subtitling: DUNE MK
