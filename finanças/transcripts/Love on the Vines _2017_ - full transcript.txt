The lawyer called, wants to meet with me tomorrow. Nice. My flight leaves for California at 6:00 am. So some lawyer calls, and you decide to take off for wine country in the middle of the Steward case? It's not like it's a vacation. My great-uncle's lawyer insist that I meet with her in person. I am sorry about your uncle, but is there some way you can do this over the phone or the e-mail or something? We're slammed. Anyway, Kirkbride wants to know - when you'll be back. - I don't know. Maybe I'll take a few days while I'm out there and think about things. I have 55 unused vacation days. Maybe your uncle left you some money so you can travel - the world and take me with you. - No. There were some paintings in his office that I loved. I'm sure that's what this is about. Fair enough. ♪ Change my course along the way ♪ ♪ Can't go back to yesterday ♪ ♪ Ooh, I got a feeling that's so wrong ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Babe, I'm going backward after all ♪ So are there any emergencies since I've been gone? Everything's an emergency with Kirkbride. He literally can't deal with you being gone. Oh, I've never talked to vacation Diana. So not a vacation. Though it will be nice to see the vineyard again. I always meant to come back here. There just... I don't know, always seemed somewhere more important to be. - Hey, Suzy. - Hey. I'm on my way to see your mom. - Oh, tell her I say hi. - I will. She says you guys have a fantastic new dessert. Of course she did. It was her idea. [chuckles] That sounds about right. [chuckles] Good luck. Hey, thanks. I'll see you. Okay. So I'll follow up your texts and calls the second they come in, you got it? Well, if you have to be out of the office, - promise me you'll have fun. - Okay. Well, I got to go. I'm almost there. - I'll call you when it's over. - Okay, but you better sound like vacation Diana. [phone beeps] ♪ ♪ - Seth, how are you? - Hey, Grant. I understand today's the day you take over Golden Range. Hopefully. Well, as a fellow vineyard owner, I know what a high-risk business it is. Yeah. Let me make you an offer on the winery. I'm sure you'll find it very attractive. Oh, I should get inside. Jill's waiting for me. [upbeat music] ♪ The sun is shining ♪ ♪ Ooh, it feels good ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ All my life I've been right where I should ♪ ♪ ♪ - Hey. - Hello, Seth. I brought you your favorite cab. Oh, thank you. I love all the Golden Range reds, and I'm not just saying that. All the hard work is worth it when it makes people happy. So do I need to sign something? Hang on. We're waiting for one other person. Who? Like, a notary? Diana? Of course, you two know each other. Knew each other. Jill, I thought we were meeting alone. Well, you both need to be here. Hugh left a modification to his will. It's more like a letter, really. "Hi, Seth and Diana, as you both know, my greatest asset "is Golden Range Winery and Vineyards. I'll be leaving it to both of you to split 50/50." - Wait, what? - There's more. "My one stipulation is that you work together "to bring in the next harvest. "This might seem like a strange request, "but it's my last wish, so I do hope you honor it. Hugh." ♪ Why don't you tell me ♪ Amelia, that guy is back again. He must be new in town. It's probably for your blue cheese burger. I hear it's getting quite the reputation. I don't think he's interested in the food. [sighs] Hugh never mentioned this at all. I'm sorry, Seth, I know this wasn't what you expected. The harvest isn't for a couple weeks, right? Yeah. I'm only here for a couple days. Well, then you'll have to find a way to stay, but after that you can do what you want with your share. Okay, but what if she goes? Then Golden Range is auctioned off. I just don't know how I'm going to take - this much time off work. - Well, you can say no, but Seth can't inherit if you do. [gentle music] ♪ ♪ So our special today is the tuna melt. Does the radiance of your smile melt the cheese? I'm sorry, I-I can't believe that just came out of my mouth. It's okay. Believe it or not, - I've actually heard worse. - I'll just come out and say it. I would like to take you to dinner sometime. I don't date my customers. Can I get you anything to drink? - Um, iced tea. - Okay. So I'll text you the address. I guess I'll be staying here for a few weeks. You can bring it back. You own a winery. Well, not yet. I have to split it with my ex. Your ex? Details, please. There aren't any. We dated the summer before I went to college, and we didn't keep in touch. [sighs] Well, I am jealous. I would love a few weeks in wine country. Is that Diana? - Put her on speaker. - Yes, sir. Diana, what's this about extending your vacation? Boss, hi. Um, I have to stay here for a few weeks, - family business. - [groans] Well, I'm gonna need you to do a document review - for Catchen Industries. - Okay, I could work from here. Hey, virtual office, very trendy. Fine, I'll have Liz send you the files. Get on it. I think vacation Diana just died a horrible death. - Here's your iced tea. - Thank you. Here's your check. Whenever you're ready. Thanks. Can I get you something to drink while you decide? Is your water filtered here? I would have to check on that. Never mind, just bring us some bottled water, and can you get someone to clean this table, please? Of course. I'll be right back. Dad, there's no reason to be rude to her. I wasn't rude. There's crumbs all over this table. Let her earn her tips. That must be Grant Gerritson's son. I heard he was back in town. Well, that makes sense. His pick-up lines are cheesier than the quesadillas. So? He's cute, and he likes you. He's just playing games. [upbeat acoustic music] ♪ ♪ So? I'm sure this looks familiar to you. Yeah, everything looks the same. You never did pack light. Oh, here, let me grab one of those. No, I got it. - No, Seth, let me h... - I got it. You always were kind of stubborn. And you never let anyone help. Well, as I recall, you used to find it adorable. That was a long time ago. Hi. Oh, Diana, this is my foreman, Theo. - Hi. - Hi. - The place looks great, Theo. - Thank you so much. Um, I'm gonna go check on the chardonnay. - Okay. Yup. - Pleasure to meet you, Diana. - Yeah, same. - Take care. So, I'll be staying in the guesthouse, but we might be sharing the kitchen. Not much has changed obviously. Haven't had a chance to clean this place up. - It's been too hard. - Yeah. Hey, listen, I'll... I'll box this up before I leave. Thanks, and also, as soon as the harvest is over - I'll buy you out. - Whoa. I think we'll have to talk about that. What is there to talk about? You got a great job in New York. We'll have you back to your fabulous big city life in no time. And how do you know what my life is like? I do know that you don't want to be stuck on a ranch. You are making a whole lot of assumptions here. I mean, maybe I'll stay after the harvest. - I doubt it. - How do you know that, Seth? Because leaving is what you do. ♪ ♪ - How you doing? - Pretty well. - Oh, hey, Jill. - Hey, Amelia. Would you like some more iced tea? Mm-hmm.. - Hey, Suzy. - Hi, Mom. I just heard that you volunteered to cater the Harvest Festival. I want to branch out into catering. I thought it was a good idea. I think it's a wonderful idea. - Really? - Don't worry, I'll help. Do you have time with all of your clients? Well, sure. I'm a partner, aren't I? Well, silent partner. Well, you haven't been here that long, and I know all the vendors. Actually, Mom, that would be really great. Thanks. You know, I'm thinking of featuring comfort food. Um, that's one way to go. Look, I have to run and meet a client, so why don't you and I come up with some ideas, and we'll go over them later, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Thanks. - Bye. [gentle acoustic music] ♪ ♪ We have to check the sugar content of the grapes every day. That's how we know they're ready for harvesting. - Can I try the thingie? - Refractometer. You're doing it wrong. Let... Let me... let me do it. It'll be faster. Or you could just show me how to do it, and then we could divide up the work. Well, then I have to explain, like, Brix levels, and I don't... I don't have time to be a tour guide. You are unbelievable. You said you were slammed with work stuff, so you do what you're good at, and I'll handle this. Well, Uncle Hugh left me half of this vineyard, so I want to do half the work. You were never interested in working the vines. - Why now? - I was always interested, Seth. - You would never let me help. - Hey, look, I'll have Theo get you up to speed, okay? But you say you want to do half the work, that's how much you're gonna do, no less. Bring it on. [sighs] So is harvest time close? Not close enough. You're still at work? Kirkbride is having everyone work overtime, and I mean overtime. Well, I had a chance to look at that brief. Oh, good. Kirkbride's been asking for it all day. So how are things in wine country? Well, Seth doesn't want me here, and I thought Kirkbride was working my last nerve. You just have to deal with him for a few more weeks. After you cash out your half, I bet you could afford a really nice condo on the Upper West Side. I don't know, maybe it would be fun to run a vineyard. Uncle Hugh left it to me for some reason. - You're kidding, right? - I don't know, Liz. I mean, what's back for me at the firm? Don't be silly. Everyone knows how hard you work. Either way, if I stay or go, that should be my decision, not Seth's. So if he's not related, how did he wind up with half the vineyard? Well, his dad was a foreman, so he grew up on the vineyard, and then, I mean, we were teens. He lost both his parents, so Uncle Hugh brought him in and taught him the business. So did he age well? All that field work, I'm thinking muscles. Liz. Okay, let's get back to the brief. [birds chirping] [upbeat dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Diana? [sighs] Diana? Ah! What? Whoa. What time is it? Oh, I have to go to sleep. No, you have to wake up. It's already 6:00 am. Yeah, I got that. What, um... - what time do we start work? - We start now. We have to go check the grapes for mildew. But I got a conference call. Hey, you're the one that wanted to work the field. Amelia! Amelia. Running off that Reuben special? Just clearing my head. Hey, there's some nice trails around here. I could show you sometime. I'm training for a marathon. The only marathons I could make it through - are the ones on TV. - [laughs] Did you catch the Hitchcock marathon last weekend? I still can't take a shower. [both chuckle] I got to go. I have to get to work before the lunch rush. [upbeat music] Is Diana coming out today? Yeah, she's on a conference call. Let's hurry up and get this block finished - before she finds us. - You know, she just got here. - She might get used to the work. - Let's hope not. By the end of the week she'll be homesick for New York. - You think? - Oh, yeah, I know. Then I'll make her a fair offer. We can concentrate on planning for next year, and I don't have to put up with any more... Mm-mm, mm-mm. Diana, so glad you could make it. Sorry about the call. I had to file for a continuance. Have you ever saved a wrongfully convicted man? [chuckles] No. I don't practice that kind of law. Okay, uh, less talk, more looking for mildew. You know, I read up on that. How do you treat it? Well, this close to the harvest, we just pick the grapes. The rest of the year, use sulfur. That's not the most effective method. No, but it's one of the safest. Maybe we could try fungicides. That's what they use down on Gerritson's vineyard. Those chemicals go into the wine. Oh, okay, well, I'll have to do more research. Yeah, you know what? Why don't... why don't you do that? I said I would do my part here. Fine, but we're in field all day. - Hello, Jill. - Hello, Grant. What's up? Well, I've been hearing some interesting things about Hugh Roberts will. Now, you know I've wanted to buy. Golden Range Vineyards for years. Yeah, I know. I hear the girl's a lawyer from New York. Can't imagine she'd be staying out here very long, can you? Hmm. Well, would you give up half a vineyard? Come on, she's only keeping it so she can sell it. Does the will say she has to sell to Seth? You know I can't talk about specifics. You wouldn't want me discussing your business all over town. I know Seth is gonna be stubborn on this. What's his price? Golden Range Vineyards is his home, Grant. I think you're wasting your time. Yeah, well, you're probably right. Thanks, Jill. Those are fancy. Better than flip-flops, I guess. Oh, you remember that? Oh. Uncle Hugh said I'd be sorry if I wanted to pick grapes nearly barefoot. At 12 years old you were stubborn, wouldn't stop till your feet were completely caked in mud. [sighs] So how's it look? Eh, sugar's not there yet. You know, I read online that you should be testing - the pH too. - The Internet also says. Martians invented Thanksgiving. No, in this case, you're right. This is a pH meter... [cell phone rings] Oh. Hey, Liz. What's up? - Diana? - Now? - Diana... - Just give me a second. We have to get this entire block done before it gets dark. - Hello? - Okay, then you go ahead, - and I'll catch up. - Diana? Hello, are you there? Okay, I'm good. [Liz speaking indistinctly] What? Oh, Amelia, hey. Oh, hey. I'm actually about to go on break, so one of the other girls can take your order. - Just give me a second. - What is this? I know, socks are so romantic. Well, they're more original than flowers. They're anti-blister. Normal tube socks aren't good for runners. That's so sweet of you. I go to this runner's yoga class at my club. - I can bring a guest. - I'm not really a yoga girl. - Are you a vampire girl? - A what? I have this app that helps you run. Uh, you pretend that vampires chase you. That actually sounds kind of fun. I'll send you the link. We can run together, maybe after your shift? Me, you, vampires, it'll be "fang-tastic." I'll think about it. [birds chirping] [gentle music] What's that? Hugh's ledger. Trying to figure out our quarterly earnings. - Is there any more pasta? - Oh, sorry, there was only a little bit left in the box. His handwriting's impossible. It's like he wrote with his feet. Can I see? What are angry pajamas? That's accounts payable, and everything that looks like a question mark is a number seven. - Are you sure? - Yeah, he writes just like my dad. That thing is a mess. We should probably get some accounting software. Hugh liked to keep everything on paper. Well, some people listen to cassette tapes. It's quaint, but you can't run a business without technology. Well, technology isn't everything. I suppose you'd want to automate the harvest? If it makes things more efficient, yeah, sure. Why not? Because machines can't inspect every grape the way Hugh did. I'd rather work twice as hard and make better wine. Okay, but there's no advantage to making our accounting more difficult, so I'm gonna order the software. Hello, welcome to the Wine and Dine Bistro. I'll be right back to take your order. Thank you so much. See you soon. - Hey, honey. - Hi. Hey, honey, listen, I was reading a craft magazine, and I came up with this great idea for the festival. What's this? I've been watching craft shows on TV, I've been reading magazines, I've been checking out forums. How do you have time for this? Oh, in between clients. This is so much more fun than planning someone's estate. [laughs] Um, Mom, this looks pretty elaborate. Oh, it's just to make an impression, Suzy. I figure if we can stand out, we can really make our business a success. We're doing okay, Mom. Well, you can never have enough customers, honey. Anyway, I could leave this with you, and you can go through it and see if you - like any of the ideas. - Okay. [sighs] Honey, this is going to be the best Harvest Festival ever. [gentle acoustic music] ♪ ♪ The starter on the tractor's been acting up. Ugh. Okay, I'll take a look at it later. Diana looked pretty wiped out. Maybe you should take it a little easier on her. If she thinks she can handle the work, she might not sell. I mean, what if she decided to run the winery from New York? Well, you know what's worse than that? If she gets annoyed with you and sells her half to Gerritson. - You should be a lot nicer. - Hey, I'm nice to her. Gerritson will outbid you. Don't give her a reason to take his offer. Find a way to be nice, okay? Yeah, okay. Look, I'm gonna go finish up. I'll catch you in the morning. [both laughing] Thanks for making me feel like a loser. - The vampires caught me. - [laughs] That's the whole point, to train you to run faster. Yeah, or to give me nightmares. [both laugh] Oh, wait, sorry. I think I have something in my eye. Looks like you lost an eyelash. [chuckles] Make a wish. What's the matter? Oh, nothing, dear. Just thought I saw someone I knew. ♪ ♪ Why didn't you wake me up? You seemed pretty tired yesterday. Thought I'd let you sleep in. Thanks, I think. Sorry I didn't make enough food for you last night. Been cooking for one for a while now. All right, what do you want? We got off to a rough start. If we have to work together, we might as well get along. Pancakes as a peace offering? I accept. Okay, so I went through the ledger last night, and I was actually able to make sense - of some of Hugh's bookkeeping. - Well, that's some good news. Not really. Sales are flat. We need to look into some new markets. Hugh was talking about that before he got sick. [car engine rumbling] Are you expecting someone? Ah, you must be Diana. I'm Grant Gerritson. I own Gerritson Vineyards. I've heard a lot about you. Well, hopefully all good. So what brings you to Golden Range? Well, I wanted to meet my new neighbor. I heard that you're a lawyer in New York. You must be wanting to get back to your firm after the harvest. Who do you work with again? Davidson, Erdman, and Kirkbride. Ah, of course, I know them well. Tom Kirkbride and I have done some work together. Oh, well, I will tell him you say hello. You know, Golden Range is a terrific little winery. With my capital and distribution network I can take this place to the next level. When you're finished with the harvest, I'm willing to make an offer 30% above asking price for your half of the business and the land. I'll beat any offer that you get. - The answer's no. - Seth, I'm willing to make you - the exact same offer. - Still no. This is my decision. Listen, you guys take a little time with this. There's no pressure. I'll have a case of my wine sent over while you mull through it. Oh, that's really not necessary, thank you. Diana, my offer stands whether Seth sells or not. I'm not selling, Grant, and since there's no point owning half a vineyard, I don't see why you'd make Diana an offer. Because eventually I think you're gonna realize that owning a little place like this is a lot more trouble than it's worth. When you want to talk, give me a call. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Well, that was a waste of time. You can't just turn down an offer without discussing it with me first. Look, Gerritson uses toxic pesticides in his farming methods. He'll ruin the soil. We can't sell to him. Maybe my uncle left me half of Golden Range because I have more business experience. Gerritson could really make this place successful. Oh, I hope it's not the engine. So now you won't even talk with me about this? You want to talk about it? Fine, let's talk about it. The way Gerritson does business... - Aah! - Oh, Seth! [grunts] Here. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. - Here, let me help you. - I'm fine. I'm fine. [grunts] The ankle's the size of a cantaloupe. You're not working in the fields. No, the cold will help. You remember when you got stung by that scorpion? You said you'd walk it off. And you ratted me out to Hugh. Yeah, well, it was for your own good. If he hadn't taken you to the doctor, who knows what would have happened? Seth, I think... I think that's a sprain. You're gonna have to rest it. No, no, the harvest could start any day. No way. Theo can handle it, and I can help. [scoffs] Hugh's will said we have to work together. That's funny. That's... that wasn't the case when you were sending me back to the house - to do my legal work. - [scoffs] Like you ever listen to me anyway. I listen to you when it's something I want to do. I guess keeping in touch with me when you moved away wasn't something you wanted to do. It didn't seem to bother you at the time. - What? - Nothing. Let's not talk about the past. While your ankle heals... you can take over my wonderful project. Oh. So how'd it go with Paul last night? Nothing happened. You're blushing. You like him. Maybe I was wrong about Paul. He's actually kind of sweet. So what'd you guys do? We went for a jog, and then he bought me a smoothie. - So a date? - No, not a date. We were just hanging out as friends. For now.

Great, and did you check the drip system in block six? - Yes, we did. - Oh, and, uh, Theo had said that he saw some mold on some of the chardonnay grape leaves. - Did he recheck those? - You know what, Seth? Why don't you go back to resting your ankle, and I will go to town to get us some dinner. - Diana, hi. - Hi. Have you met my daughter, Suzy? - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. Can I get you something? Um, can I just order something to go? - Yeah. - You're not gonna eat here? I can't. Seth hurt his ankle, so I was gonna bring him something. Oh. How are things going with you two? Let's just say harvest can't come fast enough. You know, when you make wine, it's the subtle changes that make the big difference. [sighs] Hey. - Hey. - So I got your favorite. Suzy says you love the turkey club. I do, thanks. I told you those boots were no good for the vineyard. Okay, let's just focus on the accounting. - How's it going? - Uh, I've cracked some of the ledger's code. Monkey cots is actually machinery costs. Oh, see? Now, I thought we employed a staff of live-in monkeys to stomp on the grapes. That would make us more popular with the tourists. [chuckles] Do you want some help - with the hieroglyphics? - No, I got it. All right. Well, then I am going to go work on my brief, which is, ironically, incredibly long. [chuckles] Sounds good.

I-I guess it would be rude to ignore her. - Amelia, do you mind? - No, of course not. Okay. Paul dated Brooke at Stanford. She's very pretty. Brooke is the type of girl Paul will wind up with. With all due respect, Mr. Gerritson, I don't think you know what Paul wants. Amelia, you seem like a lovely person. Paul might be enjoying your company right now, but he will get bored, and he will end up with someone like Brooke. Whatever. I just hate to see you get hurt.

I wanted the two people I loved most in the world to find each other again, to take care of each other, and if you happen to fall in love, all I ask is that you remember me in a toast.
