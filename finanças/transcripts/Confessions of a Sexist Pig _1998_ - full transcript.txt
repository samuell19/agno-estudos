* [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] * Um... * Uh... * Um... * Uh... * Bum, bum... * Uh... * Um... * Uh... uh, uh... uh... * Oh... (DISTANT LAUGHING) (BACKGROUND CHATTER) * Uh... * Uh, uh... (SIGHS) * Uh, uh... * Uh, uh... (SNIFFS) (SIGHS) * Oh... oh, oh... * Oh... (BACK GROUND CHATTER) * Uh... * Uh... (WHISTLES) * Chicka-chicka Oh, hi. I'm, uh, I'm Jack. I'm the so-called "Sexist Pig". But, I don't think I really am, ya know? I'm... I'm just a guy. Plain and simple. Like any other guy you might know, or go out with... ...or even love. Now, some women say that all men are sexist. And I agree with them. I believe there are fundamental differences in how each thinks. You see, I've... I've given this whole male... ...female thing a lotta thought over the past few years. And I've come up with a Few theories of my own. Most of which, don't provide for fairy tales about ever-lasting love. Oh boy. I can tell I'm gonna piss a lotta women off. Eh... what the hell. You know what? I'm gonna tell you everything that goes on inside a man's head. Even what he would never say out loud. Let me warn you that, uh, some of it is pretty wild. And you're probably gonna hate me for sayin' it. But, uh, oh well. Here goes. Let me start right off with a discussion about safe sex. First of all, I believe in it. Absolutely. Positively. Without a question. But, you know, I don't believe in abstinence, okay? It's unnatural, it's unnecessary. It's downright stupid, ya know? Sex is too important a part of the male female relationship to be left to a moment until after you've already committed yourself to someone for life. Hello. Thank you so much, Lucy. - Good morning. - Hi. * Uh... You look very, very, very beautiful this morning. Thank you. You're welcome. See, the first step in being liberated, is being honest about who you are. (HORN HONKS) Do you have any idea what a good looking woman does to a man? Huh? No. Of course you men do. But, for you women's sake, let me tell ya. There's a really primitive response that makes you wanna grab her, rip her clothes off, and screw her, right then and there. Of course, I'd never do that. Nor would any normal guy. But that's what we're thinkin'. Believe me. Hi. It's New York, ya know? I mean, you can't win 'em all. - (LAUGHS) Excuse me. But aren't you Dr. Grayson? -Yes. -It's wonderful to meet you. My name is Barbara. Barbara Michaels. Oh, Barbara. It's a great pleasure to meet you. -I'm Jack. -(LAUGHS) My... my friends and I have been talking about you for for two years now. -Really? You're very popular in this part of town. Okay. That's great. Here, let me give you my card. I'll write my home phone on the back. Well. I, uh, I'll try to call you later this week, maybe. I hope so. Bye, bye. Bye. Bye. INTERCOM: Dr. Westin. Please come to the nurses' station. Dr. Westin... Is that Beth's chart? -Yeah. -(SIGHS) Medication's not working. Her white blood cell count's over one-sixty. I guess I'd better tell Richard, right? Don't worry. I'll take care of it. No, no, no, no, no. You don't have to do that. She's my patient. Yes, but I've known them both since high school. (SIGHS) It should be me who tells them. Okay. Thanks. INTERCOM: Dr. Miller, extension 112. Dr. Miller, extension 112. -(DOOR CLOSING) -(SIREN WAILING IN THE DISTANCE) (SIGHS) (KNOCKING) Dr. Grayson. I need to talk to you. Michelle, it's only natural that a mother would feel the stress of her son's illness. (SIGHS) Oh, no. It's... It's not that. It's... It's you. It's me. Uh... (LAUGHS) Haven't you noticed? I'm in love with you. Oh, you... you can't be. For the past three months you're all I can think about. Michelle, you've... you've got to understand that with... with Martin's death and Jason's illness, you're under tremendous strain. Are you saying that you don't love me? I'm married to Jenny. And as corny as it sounds, I love my wife very much. Oh God. I've made such a fool of myself. No, no, no you haven't. You haven't even come in here. (SIGHS) Hey? This whole thing never happened. (SIGHS) Thank you. (SIGHS) Okay. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSING) DIRECTOR: That's a take! (HONKING EQUIPMENT SOUNDS) That was great, Jack. What do you say we break for chow, huh? -Sure. -Good. (SIGHS) -(KISS SOUNDS) Okay, everyone. That's a wrap for lunch. We'll see you back at 1:20. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (INDISTINCT CHATTER CONTINUES) No thanks. So I'm an actor. But you probably figured that out already, right? I love acting. God, you know, it's a wonderful profession. You get to entertain people. Make 'em feel good. Excuse me. You get paid for it, too. I mean, I can't think of anything else I'd rather do. * (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Right now, I'm just a soap opera actor. But, uh... one day I'd really like to do some serious work. Couldn't you see me as Hamlet? (SNIFFS) Yeah, me neither. -* (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) -Shh. We gotta go. Michelle? (DOOR CLOSING) Michelle? It's me. You in here? Huh? Huh? * (SEXY MUSIC PLAYS) Oh. Dr. Grayson. I'm so glad you came. I'm so glad you called me. You know, Dr. Grayson, I just haven't been feeling well lately. -Oh, no, no, no. (GIGGLES) -Well, let me make you feel better. -Oh. -Does this help? -(GASPS) Mm... a little. How about this? (SNAPS BUTTON) Oh, yes, I'm starting to feel better. -Maybe this, too? -(SQUEALS) Yes. (GIGGLES) (GASPS) Oh, yes. Yes. -Oh? -(GIGGLES) Doctor! * Um... uh... Hey. Yeah, um, they're just finishing cleaning up our editing stuff. -Ten minutes? -Okay Okay. Alright. That's Tracy. She's a good friend of mine. * Ooo, ah... We've developed our own technique for getting into character. It sort of goes one step beyond "The Method". Not only effective, but very fun, as well. Let me clarify one thing, alright? I'm not advocating impersonal, non-emotional, one-night-stand sex. No. Sex is meaningful. And an expression of feeling towards the other person. It just doesn't have to be the one and only person. Besides, there's no such thing as the one and only. We are not, by nature, a monogamous species. We lust after many different people. That's... that's how God made us. Now, I understand the importance of commitment, obviously, once you have children. But until that time, I intend to follow my natural instincts. (INDISTINCT BACKGROUND CHATTER) -(CLEARS THROAT) Welcome. -Hey. Hey, Shelley. (KISS SOUND) -(SIGHS) -Marty. Sorry, I'm late. -Oh, hi. I'm, uh, I'm Jack. -Anne Were you rehearsing With Tracy again, huh? Well, we were going over some lines. You were banging her weren't you? No. No, not at all. Damn you. I bet she's hot isn't she? Would you shut up? We Have a guest at the table. Sorry about this discussion. Forget it, Jack. I already warned her about you. You gotta understand, we've all worked together for like three years. And, uh, well, It can get pretty raunchy sometimes. (LAUGHS) You sound like you're almost proud of that. Well, I guess we're not always politically correct around here. What's wrong with being politically correct? Well, sometimes people can go A little overboard with that kinda stuff, don't you think? No. Not if it's offensive. Yeah, but people think offensive thoughts and no amount of political correctness is ever gonna stop that. How can you be sure? Because it's human nature, that's how. I... I, for one, have been imagining you naked during this entire conversation. And no matter what I talk about I'm still gonna be thinking about that. You're disgusting. Well, and so is just about every other straight guy you ever met. Isn't that right, Marty? Yeah. I mean... I mean I'd love to see you in your birthday suit. (LAUGHS) He's... I'm sorry, Shelly. I have to leave. You know. I'd make a comment about your "whatever" but what's the point? -(LAUGHS) Oh. -(LAUGHS) Jack, when are you going to learn to shut your mouth? Yeah, Jack. You really pissed her off. Oh, be quiet. You were even worse. Who was she, anyway? Uh, well, she just signed on as your new leading lady. Well, I guess I ticked her off pretty good, didn't I? (CAR HORN HONKS) It's just that I've decided that being truthful is very important More important, in fact, than being polite. Because, unfortunately, hypocrisy seems to characterize most male and female interactions. Men say what women want to hear. Women say what men want to hear. No one knows what the other one really wants. -Dr. Grayson? -Yeah? Can I have your autograph? Of course you can have my autograph. -What's your name? -Julia. Julia? That's a very pretty name. I think you're the hottest guy on the whole show. (LAUGHS) So do I. -Thanks. -Bye bye. I know what you're thinking. The only reason I get all these women is because I'm on a television show. You know what? You're right. Two years ago when I was a bike messenger nobody noticed me. Now I'm beating 'em off with a stick. But I'm not complaining really. -Here you go. -Thank you. (PHONE RINGING) (KNOCKING) -Hey! -Hey, Shelley. -(LAUGHS) -Uh, look, um... I'm sorry about what Happened at lunch. Oh, please. Don't worry about it. It's mostly Marty's fault anyway. Yeah, well, I just, I don't wanna screw anything up. -Mm, you're not. -(KISS SOUNDS) (LAUGHS) Wow. Uh, what was that for? What do you think it was for? Come on. Let's get off our clothes. Uh, Shelly, what are you... what are you... What are you doing? (LAUGHS) Jack, you have been flirting with me for months. And, today, you're gonna get lucky. (LAUGHS) Uh, don't you think we oughta talk about this, actually? What's there to say? Do you deny that you were coming on to me? Uh, no. I admit I'm, uh, attracted to you. But, uh, what about Marty? -What about him? -Well, he's your husband. Oh, you mean my soon-to-be ex-huband. We've been separated for three months. You know, he's... he's still my friend. And I am not your friend? Jack, I know that he has been sleeping with other people. -Right? -Uh, yeah, um... -Mm-hmm. -I couldn't say, really. That's what I thought. (LAUGHS) Uh, you know, I...I really can't do this. I'm sorry. You told me that you wanted to do what comes natural. Yeah, um, right. I do, uh... Doesn't that feel natural? -Oh. Uh, if you insist. -Uh-huh. (KISS SOUNDS) Alright. I'll admit it. I love sex. I think it's the most intense, wonderful experience you can have. What's wrong with doing It as much as possible? Americans are way to uptight and neurotic about sex. If everyone weren't so guilty about it, we'd have a lot more healthy and happy relationships. Now isn't that something worth fighting for? (KNOCKING) (DOOR OPENS) (SIGHS) What do you want? Look, I just wanna apologize for before, okay? I think I got a little carried away with my argument. And, uh, I probably never should've made that comment. I accept the apology. Look, it's just, you know, honesty's a big issue with me. You know, I, I, uh, I feel it's at the root of most problems between people. I already accepted the apology. Yeah, but can I just explain it to you? (LAUGHS) You see, I think if everyone told the truth... ...the, uh, the world would be much better off. Oh, and that's why you talk about seeing me naked? Actually, yes. I'll admit it was, uh, inappropriate but, uh, I mean it wasn't wrong. Wow. The truth is I don't wanna hear it. -(DOOR SLAM) -Oh, ow! (SIGHS) -(HONKING EQUIPMENT SOUNDS) -DIRECTOR: Action! * (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (KNOCKING) -Dr. Grayson? -Yes. I'm Molly Baldwin, The new radiologist. Oh, Molly, yes. Come, come on in. It's good to meet you. I've heard a lot of fine things about you. Well, it truly is a great honor to meet you. A great honor, no less? I feel like I should be bronzed. (LAUGHS) Everyone in County General says you are the best surgeon in the state. That's pretty high praise for someone who's only been practicing for two years. Well, I believed it. Otherwise, I wouldn't have traveled 400 miles to be here. I only hope I can live up to your expectations. Well, on one account, you've already exceeded them. Uh, no one told me how handsome you were. Well, no one said how beautiful you are, either. (SIGHS) But if they had, I probably wouldn't have hired you. I don't understand. I'm a very busy man, Dr. Baldwin. I don't know if could handle such a distraction. Dr. Grayson, I'm gonna take that as a compliment. I'm glad you are. Oh, yes. Mmm. (HONKING EQUIPMENT SOUND) -That was great! -Oh. -(KISS SOUND) -(LAUGHS) I don't think we can do better than that, huh? -Okay. -Yeah, that's a day. Terrific. Just terrific, Anne, give us a hug. Oh, uh. (LAUGHS) I loved it. I really loved it. -(KISS SOUND) -Thank you. Jack, come on. Let's talk. (INDISTINCT BACKGROUND CHATTER) So what'd ya think? -About what? -About her. Think we oughta keep her? Uh, you're asking me? Of course. Why not? Well, it's just you never asked my opinion about anything before. Jack, you're my star. Come on. You got an eighty-six "T.V.Q." I want you to be happy. I mean I saw what happened today at lunch. And if, for any reason, you don't like her, she is off the show. Well, as a matter of fact, she is kinda uptight and touchy. Well, that settles it, then. She's gone. Hey, oh, uh, wait, wait, Marty. Marty, wait a second. Uh, you know, she is a pretty good actress. And, uh, I guess that's what counts, right? (LAUGHS) Whatever you say. Yeah. (SIGHS) (INDISTINCT BACKGROUND CHATTER) Hey, Anne. Look, I just wanted to, uh, congratulate you. You know, I thought you did a really good job before. (LAUGHS) Good. Come on, Jack. -She was great. -(LAUGHS) What, you guys know each other? Yeah, actually, I just introduced myself a minute ago. I was telling Anne here, she's gonna be a big star. Man, she was so good in that scene, she even made you look good. (LAUGHS) Thanks, Troy. (LAUGHS) I'm just kidding, man. Come on, lighten up. Seriously, though, I did, uh, warn her about you. That you've screwed every leading lady you've ever had. Which, of course, shocked me. Well, thanks again, Troy. Thanks. What else did you say? Oh, just that if she needed any help rehearsing her scenes that I would be happy to go over them with her. Uh, you know, I really appreciated that. Well, I, I, uh, I guess you've, uh, covered all the bases. I sure have. Well, I guess I'll go get some lunch. Excuse me. (INDISTINCT BACKGROUND CHATTER) (LAUGHS) Sorry, Chief. But all's fair in love and war. You know that. That's okay, man. You did me a favor. -Really? -Yeah. Because, man, I think she was pretty cute. I was gonna ask her out. (LAUGHS) You're not serious, are you? Dude, did you see the butt on her? She's perfect for me, man. Nice and tight. (LAUGHS) Look, Troy, I spent some time with her, alright? And, believe me, she's definitely not for you. Oh, yeah, why? Because she shot you down? No, no, no, no, no. No. Because she's in a serious state of denial about men. Oh, she... you mean she's... No, I'm not falling for your tricks this time, Jack. She likes me. And I'm goin' for it. Alright. (SNIFFS) I'll call you next week. Okay? I miss you. I love you, too, Mom. Alright, bye. (DOOR CLOSING) (HEELS CLICKING) Jack, I have to talk to you. What's wrong? (SIGHS) Jack. I wanna get married. Are you serious? Yeah, I'm lonely and I want somebody to wake up with. And I want somebody to love. Tracy, you know how I, I, I care for you. But, um, You know, I never figured we'd Sweetie, I don't wanna marry you. -You don't? -No. (LAUGHS) Oh. I wanna marry somebody more normal. Oh. Well, who? Hm. Troy. (GIGGLES) -Troy? -Yeah. Troy. Because he's sweet and he's handsome. And i just feel like we're on the same, like, you know, like thinking length... brain wave. -I could see that. -Yeah. So will you help me? -Help you what? -Get him. (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) What makes you think I could do that? Oh, because, Jack, you have all those theories about love and you know. And I just, I know that you could get him to like me. Well, of course, I mean, I probably could, but, uh, I mean, isn't that a little manipulative? Oh, Jack. Please. Please. I want it so bad. Well, when you put it that way. No, not that. No, no. I'm gonna be a married person now. You mean it? Yeah. Just tell me. Tell me what to do first. Uh, I'm gonna have to give that some thought. Oh. -I'll tell you what. -What? -I'll hatch a plan tonight. -Okay. (LAUGHS) And call you tomorrow. -(SIGHS) Thanks, Jack. -Sure. (KISS SOUND) (SIGHS) -Hm. -Let's go get you married. (GIGGLES) Okay. Hey, big guy. What's up? Oh, hey. What do you think? $15.99. Pick that up for yourself? No. It's for Anne. We're going out to dinner tonight. And you're giving her that? Yeah. I do it with all my dates,man. It works like a charm. Troy, how would you like to make $200? (LAUGHS) Yeah, sure. Wait. How? Well, that's how much money you're gonna save by not wasting your time taking Anne out to dinner tonight. Jack, no, I already told you. No way. Just give me five minutes to explain, in detail, why it would never work out between you. -No, Jack. -Troy, it's for your own good. Buddy. Three words. Absolutely not. -That's... that's two. -Shut up. That's two words, Troy. * (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) INTERCOM: Dr. Gordley to Pediatrics. Dr. Gordley to Pediatrics. Well, what do you think? Oh, no, no. You're much more experienced than I. I don't want to make a fool out of myself. Well, in looking at this area right here, it's obvious we have an abnormality. Yes, I guess you're right. You don't seem sure. No. No, no, no. I'm sure of it. Molly, you're not being paid to agree with me. Okay. It's just that the location bothers me. 90% of tumors originate here, near the bronchial passages. This one is further up. * (MUSIC STING) That makes me think it may be a residual infection... from an undiagnosed case of pneumonia. * (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Okay, I'm sorry. I knew I was wrong. I'll just learn to keep my mouth shut. No, no. You're... you're right. You're absolutely right. I am? Yes, it's a brilliant analysis. Great. (LAUGHS) This must be my lucky day. Luck has nothing to do with it. You are a very, very smart doctor. You'll never know what that means to me, coming from you. Well, you'll never know what it means to me... to have you working here. * (ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS) (KISS SOUNDS) I shouldn't have done that. Well, I'm glad that you did. * (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) DIRECTOR: Alright, it's a take. (HONKING EQUIPMENT SOUND) (INDISTINCT BACKGROUND CHATTER) Anne, wait a second. What do you want? You're not really interested in Troy, are ya? (LAUGHS) That is none of your business. Yes, it is. Troy is my friend. And I hate to see him hurt. He is not your friend. He told me so, himself. Well, I consider him my friend, regardless. Anyway, I think you're perceptive enough to realize... that you and Troy will be completely incompatible. Which is a compliment to you, by the way. I mean, Troy's idea of heavy reading is the back of a cereal box. Oh, and you, on the other hand, have a P.H.D. in philosophy. Well, at least I read without moving my lips. You're a Jackass. Just trying to help. No, you're not. You're trying to play some sort of game. What it is, I don't know. But I'm certainly not gonna be a part of it. Why do you always think the worst of me? Just give me one reason not to. (SLIPPERS SHUFFLING) Hey. Troy, is going out with Anne tonight. Huh. I know. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, I thought you said you could stop that. Don't worry about it. After one date she'll never go out with him again. (EXHALES SMOKE) How can you be so sure? Because I know, that's how. Well, you just better be. Because that is my future husband you're talking about. (SLIPPERS SHUFFLING) (SIGHS) -* (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) -Now, I know some of you are thinking... where does true love fit into all this talk about sex? Well, love is one of the most important things in life. Obviously. But, it's also in direct conflict with our sexual drive. Because no matter how much you love a woman, after awhile, the sexual impulse wanes. Now, married men will deny this until the day they die. because their life depends upon it. But the truth is, after about two years, sex is almost always more intense and exciting... with someone new. Why is that? And shouldn't that be a serious consideration before anyone decides to get married? I think so. * (MUSIC STING) (SIGHS) Oh. (DOOR LATCHING) TROY: Oh! Hey. -Hey, man. What, uh,, what do you want? (CLEARS THROAT) (SNIFFS) So, uh, what happened last night? (LAUGHS) I'm not telling you, Jack. What kinda guy do you think I am? (LAUGHS) (CLEARS THROAT) -She shot you down? -Yeah, right. She shot me down? What are you kidding? -She did, didn't she? -(PHONE RINGING) Troy? Come on. Dude, there is something seriously wrong with that chick. I mean ,one minute, she's telling me how sweet I am. And then the next the next minute, she's calling me a "Pig". Well, what'd you do? Nothing, dude. I swear to God! I just... I tried to give her some tongue and she kicked me in the balls. Oh, shit. (SIGHS) It's not funny, Jack. It's funny, Troy. (LAUGHS) -It's not funny. -I tried to warn you, man. Hey. Jack! Don't... don't tell anybody, Jack. Hey! Don't... (DOOR LATCHING) * (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DOOR OPENING) * (MUSIC SWELLS) (FILE HITTING FLOOR) Okay. No, we mustn't. -(HEELS CLICKING) -(SIGHS) DIRECTOR: That's a take! (ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT SHUTTING DOWN) (HONKING EQUIPMENT SOUND) (FOOTSTEPS) (SIGHS) So you knee'd Troy in the balls, huh? He told you? Yeah, well, we're all like a big family around here. You know, we don't really have any secrets. Well, as far as I'm concerned, it's none of your business. No, look. Can we stop this? Let bygones be bygones? I mean we're supposed to have some sort of relationship on the show. It's pretty hard to pretend all the time. That's called acting. Yeah, well, just stop for a second, alright? -(SIGHS) -(SGHS) Look, I know we, uh, you know, got off on the wrong foot before. And it was probably all my fault. But why don't we just go to lunch, you know, talk a little? I just, I don't think it's a good idea. (SIGHS) Humor me, okay? (SIGHS) Where? Ziggy's. Twenty minutes? Fine. * (JAZZY MUSIC PLAYS) (SIGHS) MAN: No! Well? Well, what? Say something. You're the one that wanted us here. I wanna be careful about what I say. -Why? -So I don't provoke you. You don't have much regard for my intelligence, do you? See? I've already done it. Okay, you're right. Maybe we should just forget about this whole thing. Just, just wait a second, alright? Just sit down. Please? Just We can work this out. I'm gonna try to be as honest as I can. Okay? Is this where you talk about me being naked again? (LAUGHING IN BACKGROUND) Look, I think, somehow, you've gotten the idea that I'm coming onto you. Which, uh, just isn't so. Let's face it. You and I are incompatible. That's an understatement. I mean I do have to admit, I do find you sexually attractive. What a surprise. -But only on a physical level. -Thank you. It's just an involuntary reaction, you know? It's like seeing a piece of chocolate cake. Wow. I feel sorry for you. Why? Well, you think it's alright being controlled by your loins? All I'm saying is that, when I see a beautiful woman, I have an instinctual reaction. Alright, come on. Don't you ever react when you see a handsome guy? Once in awhile. You see? It's only natural. Yeah, but, I control it. I don't go sleep with a guy just because he has a great ass. Why not? You're single, aren't you? Look, how are you gonna find anyone unless you go out with people? Physical attraction is just a small component of a real relationship. Ah, but it's the first and the most important one. Yeah, for you, maybe. But, but, friendship and compatibility is much more important to me. And, and it takes time to develop. (LAUGHS) You are so serious all the time. I mean don't you ever just do anything just for the hell of it? What do you mean? Just be spontaneous without calculating the long-term affects. See, that would be irresponsible. Yeah, exactly. I bet you've never done anything in your life on a whim. -Of course I have. -Like what? That's what I thought. (LAUGHS) Don't move, okay? (SIGHS) Hi. (LAUGHS) (KISSING SOUNDS) (LAUGHS) That's very funny. That's very funny. (KISSING SOUNDS) Alright. Yeah, that's enough. I, uh, I get the point. Hey, hey. Leave him alone. Leave him alone. No. Come on. Come here. Look... Hey, I said "Bug off". You know what? Just... It's okay. It was a joke, alright? Look, you and me, outside. Right now. -This is none of your business. -Right now. Right now. You're all going outside. Now. Thanks for lunch. * (JAZZ MUSIC CONTINUES) (SIGHS) (DOOR CHIMES JINGLING) -* (INSTRUMENTAL) -Mm. Alright, I'll admit. It was, uh, it was funny. -* (INSTRUMENTAL) -Mm It's just, you know what bothers me? What kinda woman would do something like that, ya know? What... I just... I've got a serious suspicion... that she could have some real problems. -* (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) -Uh... Schizophrenia. -* (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) -Sha-sha-sha. Yeah. Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack. (HEELS CLICKING) Jack, how am I gonna get Troy? I already told you. Anne has dumped him. So why don't you just go ask him out? (SIGHS) I can't do that. Why not? Because then he would know how I felt about him. Well, that's the point, isn't it? No. The point is to get him to feel that way about me first. -Oh, so you wanna decide him? -Yeah. (LAUGHS) I'm sorry. I believe that honesty is the best policy. (DOOR OPENING) (HEELS CLICKING) Jack. (SIGHS) If I wanted to be honest, would I come to you? (SIGHS) Come on. (SIGHS) I suppose it is for a good cause. Good. (SIGHS) So, what's the secret to getting a man? Oh, you use his weaknesses against him. Oh, that sounds good. How do I do that? (LAUGHS) What's a man's most vulnerable point? His woody. (GIGGLES) (LAUGHS) No. Not exactly. See, his penis is just an extension of his real liability. His ego. Ooo, that's good. How do I use that? Well, first you build it up, and then you tear it down. Tear it down, why? Mm, well, that's how you get control. Okay. I don't understand. (LAUGHS) Alright. Stay with me, okay? -You're creating an addiction. -Oh. So, first you give the reward to the subject for free. Until you've developed a dependence upon it. -Yeah? -Alright? Then you take it away. So, without even knowing it, your subject has come under your power and... will do whatever you want. -So, Troy's gonna love me? Mm-hmm. With all his heart. (SQUEALS) (GIGGLES) Thanks. (KISS SOUND) -Go get him. -Okay. (SIGHS) (HEELS CLICKING) * (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (SIGHS) (KNOCKING) Yeah. Come on in. (DOOR CLICKING OPEN) Hey, do you have a minute? Yeah, sure. What's up? (DOOR CLOSING) Um, I just, uh, wanted to speak to you about something. Look, Trace, if this is about my breath, I stopped eating garlic for lunch, okay? Oh, no, no, no. It's not that. (SIGHS) -(SIGHS) -It's your acting. Oh, ho, ho! (LAUGHS) Really? Well, you know what? I've just started taking... acting lessons and it's gonna take a little time... for the improvement to show. No, no, no. (GIGGLES) No. -(GRUNTS) -I like your acting. Oh, yeah, right, you do. (GRUNTS) Hey, I, really, I do. -Really? -Mm-hm. I mean, I think that you are the best actor on the show. (LAUGHS) You do? (WEIGHTS CLICKING) (LAUGHS) Alright. (LAUGHS) (GIGGLES) Wait a minute. Why are you telling me all this? Oh, um, well, I was just kinda hoping... that you would give me some pointers. Pointers? (LAUGHS) Okay. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, if you really wanted me to, sure. (SIGHS) Just whenever. I mean, whenever's good for you, ya know? Just, maybe we could, um, go to lunch. -Okay. I'd like that. -Really? -Yeah. -You would? -Anytime. -(SIGHS) * Someone's soul, Where logic cannot reach... Uh, what about, uh, Jack? I thought you two were, you know? (LAUGHS) (GASPS) God! (LAUGHS) Um, Jack's kind of an idiot. Don't you think? -Totally. Really? -(LAUGHS) Yes. -Don't tell anybody. No. Never. (SIGHS) Okay. Lunch then? -Or, whatever. -Or other stuff. Yeah. (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR CLOSING) (FOOTSTEPS) You're losin' it. Losing what? (SIGHS) Whatever you had. You don't have it anymore, Jack. (URINATING SOUNDS) What are you talking about? Well, you'll find out soon enough. Would you speak English, Troy? I'm gonna laugh so hard when you find out. (LAUGHS) Not as much as me. Oh, no, sorry, buddy. This time the joke's on you, Jack. (SIGHS) * (BASS BEAT PLAYS) (ZIPPER ZIPPING) (FOOTSTEPS) * (REGGAE BEAT) Okay, okay. I'm still thinking about Anne. You know what I think's really goin' on here? She likes me. You know that old saying, "She protests too much"? Well, (LAUGHS) that's Anne. Yeah. How could she get so pissed at me unless, underneath, she really liked me? Yeah, she's just fighting it. (INDISTINCT CHATTER FROM APARTMENT) (KNOCKING) (DOOR OPENING) I'm sorry. I just can't get you outta my mind. (SIGHS) How'd you find where I live? I checked the files at work. (SIGHS) Why are you here? I think you know. Look, this can't happen. No, it already has. For me, anyway. I want you to go right now. No. No, not until you answer one question. What? Do you love me? (SIGHS) Are you serious? Yeah. I, I, I need to know. (SIGHS) (KISSING SOUNDS) (MOANS) (KISSING SOUNDS) DIRECTOR: Alright, that's a take! (KISSING SOUNDS) (HONKING EQUPIMENT SOUND) (DOOR SLAM) (INDISTINCT BACKGROUND CHATTER) * Om... * (PLAYFUL MUSIC) No, no, no. These go to Anne Henning's dressing room, alright? t's the dressing room right down there. Third one on the left. Oh, that's for you. Thanks. * (PLAYFUL MUSIC) I know it's corny. But, believe me, it works. Because women love flowers. No matter what a woman tells ya, she's always a romantic at heart. Yeah. It's an innate response, really. I mean, they can't help themselves. (HEELS CLICKING) Hi. Could I talk to you, please? Sure. (HEELS CLICKING) (DOOR OPENING) I just wanna know one thing. Anything at all. What gives you the right to send me flowers? Well, I didn't know I had to ask permission. Here's to fresh starts. (LAUGHS) Did you really think I was gonna fall for that? It seems harmless enough. Eh, is this some sort of scheme of yours to torture me? Or are you really that insensitive and callous? Neither. I like you. (LAUGHS) Look, I know things haven't gone so well, thus far. But, you know, if you give it a chance, I think you'd be pleasantly surprised. I can't believe you're saying that. I mean, what makes you possibly think... I would go out with you? The way you kiss me. Kiss you? I've never kissed you. When we're on the show. See, that's just acting. I don't think so. See, I, I just have this feeling. Well, I don't. Oh, just answer one question, okay? Is there anything that you like about me? (SIGHS) Why are you asking me all this? I mean, what difference does it make? Because I wanna know. Come on. I'll have to think about that. There's gotta be on thing. I mean, my eyes? My smile. My laugh. Disposition. I don't know, my fingernails. Well, you are sorta cute. I have to admit, you're never boring. That's two things. Two things. You know, I... if you think about it, there could be even more. (LAUGHS) Wow. Don't press your luck. So, you'll reconsider going out with me? Eh. (DOOR OPENING) * I'll be loopy, I'll be tame. Jack. Jack. (GIGGLES) It worked. After this publicity thing tonight, (HEELS CLICKING) Troy asked me out. (GIGGLES) On a date. (GIGGLES) -That's great. -(GIGGLES) So, what do I do now? (GIGGLES) I don't know. (GIGGLES) Come on, Jack, you know. I can't tell what Troy's gonna do. No one can. Well, then make something up, Jack. You're the expert on men. (SIGHS) (SIGHS) Alright. Let me think a moment. Okay. Ssh. Ssh. Is he gonna want to sleep with you? (GASPS) I would think so. (GIGGLES) (LAUGHS) You wanna sleep with him? Yes! Yes! (LAUGHS) Alright, then do it. But only once. What? -Only once. -(LAUGHS) * Never here all day. Ever? (LAUGHS) Eh, once a month. (SIGHS) Jack, that's inhuman. Exactly. We wanna bring this boy to his knees. Hm. (LAUGHS) What do I tell him? What do I say? Tell him, uh, tell him it's so overpowering, emotionally, for you to be with him, that you can only do it every so often. Oh. (GIGGLES) (LAUGHS) That doesn't make any sense. Of course it doesn't. But Troy doesn't know that. You're a woman -- life's greatest mystery. (SIGHS) Okay. Guess it's worked so far, huh? * ...when she gets... (KNOCKING) * (SOAP OPERA MUSIC) Molly, we have a problem. I know. I think I should resign and transfer to another hospital. You can't. It's the only solution I can think of. No. No. You're needed here. It's me who should leave. I can just go back to County General. I won't let you do that. I must. It's the right thing to do. I know it. And, deep inside, you do, too. Yes, of course. * (SOAP OPERA MUSIC) Then I'll send my resignation in the morning. Alright. Goodbye, Dr. Grayson. Bye, Dr. Baldwin. (SIREN IN THE DISTANCE) -Molly, wait. -I can't go. (KISSING SOUNDS) DIRECTOR: Take! (HONKING EQUIPMENT SOUND) (KISSING SOUND) You can pick me up at eight. * (BASS BEAT) Yeah. I just had an intuition that she liked me. Probably comes from the extensive amount of experience I've had with women over the years. Mm. Or my natural, extra sensitivity. (LAUGHS) * (ROMANTIC PIANO MUSIC) -(WINE POURING) -(INDISTINCT BACKGROUND CHATTER) (INDISTINCT BACKGROUND CHATTER CONTINUES) Well, here we are. Yes, we are. Well, I, I, uh, I hope you like the food. Oh, I'm sure I will. Uh, I'm really glad, actually, that you, uh, decided to come. Look, uh, before we go any further, I think we should go over some ground rules. Ground rules? Yes, I wanna be right upfront about what I want from this. Sure. Okay. Alright. Um, as you can tell, I'm a very serious person. When I go out with a man, I do so for a reason. I don't like to waste my time on frivolous affairs with no future because someone usually gets hurt. (SIGHS) Sounds pretty heavy. I want a relationship built on love and trust. I would never do anything to hurt him and I expect the same from him. So, in other words, I'm looking for someone who I can spend my whole life with. (LAUGHS) Oh, uh, look, I, um, I gotta be honest. I, I, um, I don't know what gave you the impression that I was that kind of a guy but -- No, no, no. You don't understand. I'm here because you're just the opposite of the kinda guy I wanna be with. I... I think I'm confused. You see, I think I've become too serious about life. And have decided that I should do something that I've never done before. So I wanna have a purely sexual relationship. But I need to have it with someone that I don't really care about and who is incapable of being hurt by me. (LAUGHS) And I immediately thought of you. So, you're saying you wanna go to bed with me? Yes. And all you wanna do is, uh, have sex? That's right. Nothing else. We're not even gonna be friends? That's the whole point. To sleep with someone that I don't really care about. (LAUGHS) This is, uh, this is really weird. You know, I mean, um, I don't know about this. (SWALLOWS WINE) Oh. I see. So, it's okay for a man to do it. but when a woman wants to do it, it's weird. Well, you know what? Maybe you're just the wrong guy to ask. Don't... wait, wait, wait a minute. Don't, uh, you know, I didn't say that. Well, if you have any doubts... No. No. I made up my mind. I wanna do this. Are you sure? Yeah. Yeah. But I just wanna tell ya that I don't think it's gonna work out. I don't think you're the type of woman who can handle this sort of thing. (LAUGHS) Oh, right. See, I can if you can. Come on. Let's go back to your apartment. We haven't even eaten yet. Do you wanna...? Why waste any time? * (ROMANTIC PIANO MUSIC) (SIGHS) (CRINKLING MONEY) (SIGHS) * (SEXY MUSIC) (MOANING) (MOANING) (GRUNTING) (PANTING) (MOANING) (PANTING) (MOANING) -(SIGHS) -(PANTING) (DOOR CLOSING) (INDISTINCT BACKGROUND CHATTER) Well, well, well, well. What's with the flowers? -Are they for Anne? -Mm-hm. Why are you wasting your time, man? Romance is never a waste. Dude, she's never gonna go to bed with you. So you might as well forget it. Believe me. Troy, for your information, these are not, "Will you go to bed with me?" flowers. These are, "Thanks for last night," flowers. You're lying. Shut up. Look at this smile, Troy. What's it tell ya? You you did it. You son of a bitch! You got her into bed? Damn straight. Shit. You're not the only one who got lucky, man. -I did, too. -Really? Yeah. I got this chick eating outta the palm of my hand. Oh. That's great, Troy. I can't say who it is. But let's just say this, I think you're gonna be a little bit more than surprised when you find out who it is. I'm sure I will. (LAUGHS) What's up? (KNOCKING) -(DOOR OPENING) -* (ROMANTIC MUSIC) Good morning. Good morning. It is a good morning, isn't it? What are those for? Well, they're for you. For last night. I already explained to you. None of this matters. Yeah, I know. I just thought it'd be nice. Just give them to one of your other friends. (LAUGHS) No, no. They're for you. (FLOWER WRAPPING CRINKLES) -Thank you. -You're welcome. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time for me to change. Oh. Alright. Oh. (SIGHS) (KNOCKING) * Our ending, beginning, our new beginning... I have to change. * Someone call the love police Oh. Okay. (SIGHS) Uh, you know what, there... there is one thing. I mean, I'd like to... Last night, was it, uh, Was it okay? Was what okay? The, uh, (LAUGHS) you, you know. Oh. The sex was good. Alright? Yeah. Okay, good. Yeah, I just, I... I just wanted to know. -Well, now you know. -Yeah. -Yeah, -Well, thanks. I mean, I assumed it was. Because it was good for me. -Good. -Okay, sure. Okay. Um, well, let's just... whatever. Sorry to have bothered you. I mean it won't happen again. After all, we're not even really friends, right? Right. That's cool with me. Bye. -* (UPBEAT MUSIC) -(DOOR CLOSING) (DOOR OPENING) * (FUNKY MUSIC) Oh, she must really like me. She's so scared that I might reject her that she has to pretend to have no reaction at all to, uh, what happened between us last night. I don't have to tell you it was, uh, it was pretty damn special. Yeah, I'm, you know, I'm sure she'd really like to tell me how she really feels about me but she's, you know, overwhelmed by her insecurity. * (INSTRUMENTAL) (MOANS) (KISSING SOUNDS) (MOANS) (KISSING SOUNDS) I'm sorry. I can't do this anymore. -(LIGHT SWITCHING ON) -(SIGHS) What's wrong? This isn't right. Why? We should've never done it the first time. Yeah, well, just tell me why. Because I care about you and I wanna be with you. But, you can't do that. Yeah, but we both knew that before we started. It... Yeah. Well, I can't accept that anymore. (SIGHS) -Just. come on. -No. Come on. -It hurts too much. -(SIGHS) (DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING) DIRECTOR: That's a take! (HONKING EQUIPMENT SOUND) (KNOCKING) * (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Hi. Hi. How are you? Fine. What are you doing here? I wanna talk a little. (SIGHS) Come on, Jack. I already told you. -I don't wanna -- -I know. I know. I've just been... Can I come in? I've been doing a lotta thinking about this and I've... I've come to the conclusion this has got to be some kind of a game. I mean it is, isn't it? -It... -(SIGHS) No one wants only just sex. It's unnatural. Troy put you up to this? No. Or Shelly did. Or, or Tracy. (LAUGHS) I said no. (SIGHS) Think of who else you know. Uh, you haven't been talking to my mother? Okay, look. I'm trying really hard not to be insulted here. The only thing that's going on is exactly what I told you. Now, Jack, I mean, if you can't handle it, just... just let me know. Me, handle it? What? Are you kidding me? This is the type of relationship that I dream about. I mean, you know, no obligations. Very few complications. Just, you know, pure, carnal lust. I like that. Alright, then. We'll just forget about this whole talk, okay? Sure. What... whatever you want. Okay. * I wanna be the kind you don't know... This... this your, uh, family? * That's what we have to do... Oh. (SETTING PICTURE ON THE TABLE) Excuse me. (DOOR OPENING) Okay. -(SIGHS) -* (BASS MUSIC) (DOOR CLOSING) Do you believe her? (SIGHS) Me neither. I mean, but if she wants to play that game, that's... that's fine, you know. I can do that. (FOOTSTEPS) -Jack, we gotta talk. -What? -What's? -Somebody's screwing Shelly. Uh, what... what gives you that idea? Cause she's been really nice to me lately. Well, that's a good thing, isn't it? No! Somebody's doing her. I'm sure of it. Look, Marty. What do you care? You're... you're getting divorced. Oh, she wants to get divorced. Not me. Well, yeah. Cause you were screwin' around. So? Look, Marty, I, mean, you know, I don't... I don't know what to tell you. Keep an eye out on her for me. Cause I'm gonna catch that bastard. Okay. (FOOTSTEPS) Alright. (SIGHS) Oh, Jack. Just the man I was lookin' for. Listen, man, you gotta help me. Hey, look, I'm in a real hurry. No, no, no. But, listen. Dude, it's Tracy. She is driving me nuts. Oh, by the way. I'm seeing her now, okay? Yeah, I know. She told me. -Good. -Okay. Good. No, wait, hold on, Jack. Just time out. -Listen. -(SIGHS) I need your advice. Okay? I need your help on how you can get her to like me. You want me to help you get Tracy? Buddy, you are the expert on women, man. -(LAUGHS) -What? -Uh, it, uh... -What's so funny? Nothing. I just, uh, I just don't know if I should help you, that's all. Why not? You're perfect. You know me and you, you know, you know her. (LAUGHS) It's a bad idea. No, Jack. Come on, man. I am asking you here, man to man. Please. (SIGHS) Alright. Just answer me one question, okay? Anything. You really care for her? Yes, I do. Alright, I'll help you. You will? Yeah, man. Okay, what do I do first? Just do exactly what you've been doing up to now. -Mm-hmm. -While I scope out Tracy for ya. -Okay? -Oh. Good idea. And we'll come up with a plan to really knock her off her feet. Oh, man. That is huge. You have no idea how much I love you. -I think I do. -You're the man. -Okay. -Yeah. -So long. -Yeah. ((LAUGHS) (FOOTSTEPS) * (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (MOANING) (MOANING) (PANTING) (KISSING SOUNDS) (SIGHS) * (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) I'm really glad you're here. (BED SHEETS RUSTLING) What is it? What? What? What'd I do? Nothing. I need to go. Well... just wait a second, Anne. There's something I've gotta say to you, alright? I really can't stay. It'll only take a minute. Look, it's important. Please. Alright. What is it? How'd you like to go to dinner with me? And then maybe do something after? (LAUGHS) Are... are you asking me out on a date? Well, it's just that we s pend all this time together and we don't do anything but -- Yeah, but, I mean, that's what we agreed to, right? I know, but it's not like that's all we have to do. I mean what's the possible harm? I just, you know, I... Come on. What've you got to lose? I mean, I'll even pay. (LAUGHS) I'd really like it if you said "Yes". Okay. How 'bout, uh, seven o' clock? Seven's great. I... I like seven. Thanks. (LAUGHS) Alright. (CLEARS THROAT) (CLAPS HANDS) (FOOTSTEPS) -* (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS) -Peanut butter on pasta? Yeah. It's great. The peanut butter melts into the spaghetti. It's just like a sauce. Only takes like ten minutes to make. Ew. Where's your sense of adventure? Where's your sense of taste? You know, you are the most obstinate person I've ever met. Yeah. Except for you. Of course. -Me? -Yeah. You're worse than I am. You think you know the answer to every question ever asked. Oh. As if you don't think the same thing about yourself? Have you ever uttered the words, "I'm wrong", since the first day I met you? I'm waiting for you to say it first. * (CALYPSO MUSIC PLAYS) Alright, I'm wrong. Sometimes I'm wrong, too. * (CALYPSO MUSIC PLAYS) I had a good time tonight. Me... me, too. Ah, see? I told you it wouldn't be so bad. I guess so. (LAUGHS) So, could we have dinner again? As long as you don't cook. (LAUGHS) Tomorrow? I can't. I'm busy. Busy? Doing what? Well, if you must know, I'm going out. (CLEARS THROAT) Well, I know it's none of my business. But, uh, do you mind if I ask is it with another guy? Well, yes, it is. -(CAR SCREECHING PAST) -Great. No, that's fine. You know, I mean, I, um, actually, I was supposed to... supposed to go out, anyway. Okay. * (CALYPSO MUSIC CONTINUES) (CAR PULLING UP) -(DOOR OPENING) -Thanks. (CAR DOOR CLOSING) (CAR DRIVING AWAY) Do you believe what's happened? (SIGHS) I mean, everything was going along so well. You know, we were getting along great, then, BAM. (SIGHS) And it's not that I'm, you know, really upset. It's just, you know, after all, we have this understanding. I don't know. I guess I'm just a little shocked, ya know? I know you're wondering if I'm jealous. And, the truth is, yeah, you know, I mean, I... I am, I feel a slight twinge, which is natural, ya know? I mean, jealousy's a primitive reaction going back to our caveman days. But it's inappropriate behavior now. I know that. You know, I may be a sexist, but I'm fair. (SIGHS) (KEYS UNLOCKING DOOR) (INDISTINCT BACKGROUND CHATTER) Well? Well, what? Don't you wanna say anything? (LAUGHS) I mean we are having lunch. I don't have anything to say. (PLATES SETTING DOWN) Alright. (CLEARS THROAT) * (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS) Hi. Mark. What are you doing here? I came to see you, of course. Why didn't you call? (LAUGHS) I wanted to surprise you. What? Aren't you happy to see me? Of course. Of course I am. (KISS SOUND) (GIGGLES) Gee, that's not much of a kiss for your fiancé who's come 400 miles to see you. Oh. (KISS SOUND) I'm sorry. (GIGGLES) Hi. How are you? I'm Mark Fisher. Oh, uh, hi. Mind if I join you? (CLEARS THROAT) Uh, uh, please. -Uh, uh, sit... sit down. -Great. (CLEARS THROAT) Well, uh, you two must, uh, work together, right? Oh. Yes, naturally. Of course. So, tell me. How's my girl doin' at her new job? (LAUGHS) Uh, excellent, Mark. Uh, yeah, she's... she's a very talented person. Uh, could you give us a... a moment alone? Then I'll have to be going and, uh, you can spend the rest of the afternoon with her. No, of course not. I'll just, uh, -I'll wait over by the bar. -Nice. (KISSING SOUND) Just a minute. Okay? (FOOTSTEPS) Look, I know this is a big shock to you. But if you just let me explain. What's there to explain? You are engaged to be married. I mean, why should you tell that to the man you're just sleeping with? It's not what you think? How do you know what I think? Look, I was going to tell you about him. I -- Oh, when? After I made a bigger fool of myself? -You don't understand. -Understand what? I was... it's over between Mark and me. I was... I just can't tell him. It's you that I really care for. -(HAND SLAMMING TABLE) -Don't say that to me. * (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS) I gotta go. (NAPKIN HITTING TABLE) I love DIRECTOR: Alright, it's a take! (LIGHTS CLICKING OFF) (SILVERWARE HITTING TABLE) MAN: Take. -(SIGHS) (HONKING EQUIPMENT SOUND) (INDISTINCT BACKGROUND CHATTER) * (BASS BEAT PLAYS) Now, I want you to understand what I'm doing so you don't get the wrong idea. I know we have this understanding, you know. And, Anne, of course, can go out with whomever she wants. But I started thinking, you know, and I was wondering if maybe she might not have pretended to be going out with someone just to make me take her more seriously. I mean, not that I'd be angry if, in fact, she was lying. You know, the truth is, I think it would be quite endearing. Well, it's been over an hour and she still hasn't come out yet, so at this point I guess you could pretty much say that my hunch was right. Yeah. Well, I guess it just goes to show that women aren't the only ones with intuition, huh? (LAUGHS) Holy shit. -* (SEXY MUSIC PLAYS) -(BACKGROUND CITY STREET NOISE) You know what this means, don't you? It means that everything she said about just having a sexual relationship with me is probably true. Yeah. She doesn't care about me. She's just using me for my body. What kind of a woman is that, hm? * Uh... What if this isn't even a date? You know, I mean, what if this is like some friend of hers or, uh, or her brother, even? You know, it could be. (CAR PASSING) What if they're sitting over there, right now, just laughing their asses off at me? No, you know what? That's it. I'm outta here. * Ooo... ah... How could this possibly happen? You know, how... how could she do this to me? * Uh... And what am I doing here? I, I must be going crazy. You know, I'm... I'm Jack Westmore. Jack Westmore. You know? I don't care what she does. She can go out with whoever she wants. She... she can sleep with whoever she wants. I am way beyond jealousy. (KNOCKING) Open this door. I know you're in there! (KNOCKING) (DOOR OPENING) Jack. What are you doing here? I came to see you. I told you I was busy Yeah, well, I got something I wanna say to you now. Is it an emergency? Are you in trouble? Well, uh, no. Then why don't you call me tomorrow? Why can't I come in? No, Jack! You can't. Is there a problem? Who is this guy, Anne? It's alright, Steve. I can handle it. Would you please just leave now? No. No, not until you let me in to say what I gotta say. Hey, look. Why don't you listen to what the little lady has to say. Well, why don't you just mind your own business, pal? This is my business. So leave. Oh. Leave? You giving orders now? Yeah, I'm -- (PUNCHING DOOR) Ow! Ow. Ow. -(GRUNTS) -Ow! Ow. Ah. Ow! Oh, you kicked me in the shin. Stop it. Both of you. Ah. (SIGHS) -Ah. -Come on in, Jack. (SIGHS) Well, you said you wanted to come in. So, get inside. * (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS) (DOOR CLOSING) (HEELS CLICKING) Now, what is it? Oh, well... uh, Well, let's hear it, Jack. I love you. * (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS) What a dork. * (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS) (FOOTSTEPS) (DOOR CLOSING) Oh, God. How am I ever gonna leave this apartment? (SIGHS) How could I have been so stupid? (SIGHS) Have you ever seen a bigger idiot in your life? -(SIGHS) -(DOG BARKING IN THE DISTANCE) What in the world am I gonna tell Anne? There's no explanation. I... sugar. Sugar. That's... that's it. That... that... that's, uh, temporary insanity brought on by a sugar deprivation. Yeah, I mean, they've... they've done, like, you know, scientific experiments where, uh, you know, they've proven that too low a blood sugar can cause, like, psychotic behavior. Perfectly logical explanation. In fact, I had a patient on the show a couple months ago. That's exactly what happened. She killed her boyfriend, you know. (LAUGHS) That's it. That's... ba-ba-bam. Sugar. She'll have to believe it. Oh. Oh, oh. (BALL BOUNCING) Look, I know you probably never wanna talk to me again, but, uh, no... Okay. I... I was completely wrong. Um, (SIGHS) look, okay. I'm a moron. I'm a real moron. (KNOCKING) Jack? Man, you gotta help me. Tracy wants to take me home to meet her mother. Well, that's... that's great. I mean, she really likes you. Dude, if I go home with her, she's gonna realize how much I like her. -(PHONE RINGING IN DISTANCE) -There you go. Then you can be completely honest with her about, you know, how you feel. Are you crazy, man? If I do that, she's gonna have the power over me. Wha -- relationships are about love, not power. (LAUGHS) Yeah, right? Since when? Since the beginning of time. That's great, Jack. That's... that's your best advice, huh? You know what, man? I'm outta here. Thanks. You know what your problem is? Educate me. You think too much. You know, as long as you think that love is a game to be won or lost, you're never gonna find it. I mean love is... is a treasure to be found only by exposing yourself and being as vulnerable as you can. The minute you start to think you can outsmart someone, you've lost. Shit, Jack. That was deep. Yeah, it was. Wasn't it? Yeah. Alright. (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR CLOSING AND LOCKING) -(SIGHS) -(BELL RINGING) (DOOR OPENING) -Hey. -Hey, Steve. -Hi. -Hi. Could I talk to you? Yeah. Sure. Come on in. Okay. (FOOTSTEPS) I just... I wanna apologize for last night. Oh, it wasn't your fault. Nevertheless, I... I feel bad. Why? I had a great time last night. 'Till that nut showed up. (LAUGHS) Yeah. God. He was, uh, really wacko, wasn't he? You're telling me. (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) (SIGHS) Listen, if you really wanna make it up to me, let me take you out tonight. I can't. (SIGHS) Why not? Well, it... it's about that guy last night. I just think... -(FEET SHUFFLING) -(GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (BODY HITTING THE GROUND) (DOOR SLAMMING) STEVE: Let me in! We gotta talk. Jack, no. You can't keep on doing this. Just hear me out, okay? (SIGHS) I guess, under the circumstances, I don't have a choice. (KNOCKING) STEVE: It's my apartment! This'll only take a minute. STEVE: I said, "Open up!" No, I am not opening this door until I'm through! STEVE: I'll call the cops! Yeah, go ahead. Be my guest. -(KNOCKING) -What is it you want, Jack? I wanna tell you that you win okay? You beat me. I mean I don't know if I'm up, or down, or if I'm coming, or if I'm going. I don't know anything. Just tell me whatever it is you want from me and I'll do it. What... what makes you think that I want something from you? Then why are you torturing me like this? I'm not torturing you. You're torturing yourself. What is it that you want from me? I want from you? Yes. Why are you here? I mean, what do you want? (SIGHS) (SIGHS) I want... I wanna know if you like me. -Like you? -Yes. Yes. Or hate me. Or anything, ya know. I have no idea how you feel about me. (SIGHS) I like you, alright? (SIGHS) Since when? I was attracted to you from the very first day that we met. You were? You... Well, then what's all this been about? I mean... (SIGHS) Why? Why wouldn't you go out with me? Because, Jack. You stood for everything I don't like in a guy. I mean, how could I go out with you? So, I... I decided to sleep with you. But that just made it worse. It did? Yeah. It did. Because the more I got to know you, the more I realized you're not such a bad guy. And it made me like you even more. (SIGHS) That's great. I mean, that's... that's really great, ya know? Um, I don't know what's so great about it. Well, because, you and I can have a relationship now. You know, a real relationship. I don't think so. Why not? Because you and I are talking about two different things. When you say relationship, you mean fling. That's not what I want. I want something more than just a good time. Like what? Like love and trust. I want that, too. And commitment. Commit... commitment. Yeah. Commitment. You know, one person, and only one person. Do you want that, too? That sounds so serious. God, that's what I thought you'd say. Just wait a second, alright? I just... I, I need, uh, I need time to think about it. And I... I mean this is an important decision, right? Yeah. You let me know. * (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (FOOTSTEPS) (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR CLOSING) (SIGHS) -(FOOTSTEPS) -That's the guy! (FOOTSTEPS) I'm going. I'm going. (HEELS CLICKING) Uh, wait. Trace. Hey, wait up. -Hi. -Hey. Um, I need to talk to you. Me, too. Okay. Uh, look. Come here. Um, I wanna be perfectly honest with you here. I have tried to deceive you and... and fool you into liking me. And... and I haven't been honest about my feelings, or my motives, or anything. So there. Me neither. -You... you haven't? -No. You, you either? No. (LAUGHS) Wow. Wait a minute. You mean this whole time we've been lying to each other? Yeah. I guess so. Oh my God. That makes our entire relationship make-believe. Wow. (LAUGHS) I feel so stupid. (LAUGHS) (VOCAL GUN SOUND) No, I'm stupid. (VOCAL GUN SOUND) No. (LAUGHS) Oh, shit. So, so, um, so what, so what, so what should we do about this, then? How 'bout nothing? -Nothing? -Yeah. Cause you know I, I like you. Yeah? Well, I like, you know, who you've been pretending to be. So, if you keep doing that, you know. -(LAUGHS) -It'll be good. -No kidding. -(GIGGLES) Wait. You got... you got something. -I'm just gonna, um... -Oh. What is -- -Oh, oh. Mm. -Mm. (KISSING SOUNDS) -Wait a minute. -What? What do you think Jack's gonna say? Who listens to what Jack says? -I don't. (LAUGHS) -Yeah. -No way. Mm. -Mm. (KISSING SOUNDS) (MOANS) -Wait. -Oh my God. -(GIGGLES) -Stop, stop, stop, stop. (KNOCKING) -Yeah? -(DOOR OPENING) Shelly? (DOOR CLOSING) Can I talk to you? Where have you been? I haven't seen you in about a week. Oh, I've just, uh, you know, I've been busy. Have you been avoiding me? What? No. Of course not. Good. Then we can have some fun. No, no, no. Shelly, I can't. I can't. Oh, yes, you can. No, I'm serious. I mean it. -What? -I can't. Well, what is wrong with you? I think I'm gonna be monogamous. You? Monogamous? Uh, with who? Anne. This has gotta be a joke, right? I mean you're the guy who said you could never be faithful to anyone. I guess I'm in love. Oh, no. No, no, baby. Come here. Come here, baby. Sit down. You're not in love. You're just crazy. Did you, or did you not, tell me that it was unnatural for a man to be monogamous? -I did. -Yeah. And did you, or did you not, say that there are at least ten women a day that you wanna screw? -I did. -Uh-huh. And did you, or did you not, say that you had no conscious control over these feelings. And that, no matter what you did, there was nothing you could do to change. I did. Well, were you lying, Jack? Was that all just a bunch of crap? No. No, you know what? I believe that. I do. Then it is impossible for you to be monogamous, Jack. (KISSING SOUNDS) Shelly, no! I can't. Jack, do you know what today is? No. I don't. It's my birthday, Jack. -Oh, oh, oh. -Uh-huh. -Oh, God. -Yeah. You know, I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't know. You want me to have a Happy Birthday, don't you? Of course I do. Well, this would make me very, very happy. Oh, oh, come on, Shelly. Stop it. Just pull... put that... you know, you should go see Marty. -Marty? -Yes. You'd be surprised how much you guys have in common. Why? Does he wanna screw you, too? Oh, Shelly, stop -- -(DOOR OPENING) -Surprise! -Oh, shit! -(GASPS) -(GASPS) -Oh, ho, ho. Anne. Anne. Anne. Anne! -You son of a bitch! -Oh! -* (CALYPSO MUSIC PLAYS) -You're screwing my wife! I'm not your wife! We're divorced. -That doesn't matter. -Yes, it does. But I still love you. Oh, you're crazy. I hate to interrupt. But I gotta go. -(GRUNTS) -Oh. Oh! Oh, oh. Oh. Sorry, Marty! You're fired, you bastard! (FOOTSTEPS) * (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) Anne! Anne! (FOOTSTEPS) Anne! Anne, stop. Wait. Wait. Anne, you gotta let me explain. You got... you got... I decided I... I wanna have a relationship with you. Get the hell away from me. I was only in Shelly's office to talk about you! You bastard! (DOOR SLAMMING) Anne! Anne, you don't understand. Anne! (CAR MOTOR DRIVING AWAY) Anne, I wanna be monogamous! Aw. (CITY STREET SOUNDS) INTERCOM: Flight 215 to Los Angeles is now boarding at Gate 27. Well, I was wrong. I've done a lotta thinking about what happened and I decided I was really wrong. Not that any of what I said about man's nature wasn't true. It... it is. It's just that... It wasn't the complete picture. There's another aspect of men that I didn't give enough weight to. And that's their need for love. As for Anne, uh, she might've been the one person for me, ya know? * (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS) But I'm never gonna find out. I... I can never talk to her again, you know? I... I've already made too big a fool of myself already. I mean how's... how's she gonna believe me now? No. Anyway, I'm splitting. Going to Los Angeles to look for work. And, uh, I guess that's how this is gonna end. With me a sadder, but wiser man. Which is about what I deserve, isn't it? INTERCOM: Attention Passengers. This is the final boarding call for flight 215 to Los Angeles. Now departing at Gate 27. * (BASS MUSIC PLAYS) Wait a minute. You know, I'm already a fool. I'm already a fool. What difference does it make? (HONKING EQUIPMENT SOUND) DIRECTOR: Action! * (SOAP OPERA MUSIC PLAYS) (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR CLOSING) (FOOTSTEPS) What... what did the crew say? There's no sign of him. They checked the airport and the bus terminal. There's no record of him leaving town. He just cannot have disappeared. Well, I don't know where he can be, Molly. You know, I have checked every inch of this county. I... I just don't know what I'm gonna do. Oh, Matt. We... we... we can't think the worst. I need your help, Molly. I'm weak. I'm so very weak. -(SIGHS) -(ELEVATOR DOOR DINGS OPEN) -I'm right here, Matt. -I know. So am I. Holy, she -- I mean, um, uh, hey. Uh, Je -- Jeff. Why, why, why you doin' here? I decided to come back. Uh, uh, well, that... that's... that was not in the... I mean they said that... It's okay, good buddy. I'm fine. Just need a little time to myself. Oh. God. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to have a few words with Dr. Baldwin. Uh, uh, yeah, but I... I was, um... okay. Yeah, alright. Just... So, you're back? Yeah. I got all the way to the airport but then I couldn't leave. Why not? Because I think once you've found what you really want in life, you can't walk away from it. No matter what the consequences How do I know you won't change your mind? You seem to do that a lot. You don't. Neither do I. But we'll never find out unless we try. And I'll do whatever has to be done to be with you. Just let me know you feel the same. It sounds so serious. It is serious. I'm serious. Do you love me? Yes. I do. (LAUGHS) (KISSING SOUNDS) DIRECTOR: Yes! That was great. I love it. Fantastic. It's a keeper. Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no. Wait a second, you know. That wasn't in the script. At all. And I was... I was... I was gonna cry in this scene. -Sandy, he stole my scene, man. -Come on. Now, don't worry, Troy. We'll let you cry tomorrow. You can kill off one of your patients by mistake. -Okay? -Alright. Okay. So why are we here? That's a wrap, folks. Let's go home. (HONKING EQUIPMENT SOUND) * (SOAP OPERA MUSIC SWELLS) * (SOAP OPERA MUSIC CONTINUES) * (SOAP OPERA MUSIC CONTINUES) * (SOAP OPERA MUSIC CONTINUES) * (SOAP OPERA MUSIC CONTINUES) -* (UP TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) -Well, I guess this really is the end now. And everything turned out happily after all. I mean, Anne and I are together and doing really well. I mean, I don't even miss sleeping around at all. The truth is when you're with someone you love, the sex is so much more meaningful and fulfilling. * I'll be there when she gets home... I don't think about other women. At all. I mean, I... I barely even notice that they exist. * I'll be there when she gets home... Well... * And I can be wrong, And I can be right... There was this one today that I saw just for a split second, outta the corner of my eye. * I'll be there, when she gets home... She was pretty good. Nice hair. Real short skirt. Oh, and her legs were like a mile long. And her chest? God, it was huge. (SIGHS) Man, she was great. * That's right. Oh, men. -Aw... -(LAUGHS) * There's one thing I can say. DIRECTOR: Cut! We're through with that. * (POP MUSIC PLAYS) Are we done? -DIRECTOR: Yes, we are done. -We're done. Alright. We're gonna do the credits right now because this is such a low budget film that we don't have enough money to really afford 'em.
