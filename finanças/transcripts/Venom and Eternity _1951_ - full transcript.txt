A restored print: Dear spectators, you are about to see a discrepant film. No refunds will be given. The Management. ON VENOM AND ETERNITY A treatise by Jean-Isidore Isou This film is dedicated to: and to all those who contributed something new and personal, to the art of cinema. In hopes that the filmmaker will, some day, be judged worthy of them. This film is part of a larger work which has the fervent support of thirty "youths," at most. Léon Bloy said you cannot be "somebody" before the age of 50. The economist Keynes wrote that a system of ideas takes at least 25 years to reach the "public." But the filmmaker himself is also too young; his work is inevitably fragmentary; and parts that have been published, have been scoffed at or ignored. By the same author: Chapter 1 First principles The sound was first recorded on vinyl with the kind help of: These disks, when transferred to film, retain some of their "crackling" noises. These were kept because of the contribution they make to the (involuntary) revolutionary character of the film. The characters, story, and settings are (of course!) imaginary: any resemblance to real people or places is purely accidental. Even the Saint-Germain neighborhood has been invented by the filmmaker; it simply represents the heros Way of the Cross. Daniel left the Cine-Club, his head shattered by noise, as if his skull had been used as a goblet by cannibals from the Solomon Islands, as if his brain had been battered by barbaric drinking toasts. After the Cine-Club screening, and during the usual incoherent debate that followed, he had tried, for the first time, to expound his new and original ideas about the Art of film. His own words, thrown out to the room now came back to him as intoxicating as alcohol. I am engrossed by the cinema, by its inherent potential for discovery and for uninterrupted progress. I love the cinema when it is insolent and refuses to obey the rules. A film can make Cinema History today because guys like Griffith rather than stick to tradition, by leaving the camera in one place and have the actors act around it had the audacity to shoot close-up, to show tears rolling down the heroine's face a simple fraction of the whole monstrously filling the screen, to the detriment of the rest. I don't like imitators! In cinema, I love Eric von Stroheim's innovative cruelty, how he bursts with his sadistic nails a white pimple on his terrible face! How the arrogant hateful officer drops a woman's bag without bending to pick it up only for the camera to reveal to us seconds later that his two arms are horribly mutilated. But I don't like imitators! I love in cinema when Eisenstein in "Battleship Potemkin", uses social symbolism for the first time. A crowd crushes itself, shot on the steps by an advancing army rigid as the inhuman tank of Greek fatalism. The contrast between a baby carriage escaping disaster all by itself and the regular cadence of the soldiers' boots carries the revelation of revolutionary history! I don't like Eisenstein's imitators! We have all seen Chaplin's innovative use of indirect allusion in "A Woman of Paris": instead of seeing the train leave, we see the light of the train's windows rolling across a woman's face. I'm fascinated by cinema, by the surrealist imagery of Buńuel's "Un Chien Andalou": a cloud slicing the moon is compared to an eye halved by a razor blade. The disgusting iris pukes from its socket like a raindrop. - But we know all that! - Get to the point! - Bravo! - Strip! Calm down, you assholes, shut up! I just wanted to say that I don't want to make films that take advantage of other people's mistakes. I want to run my own risks, for the sake of my soul. I want my own personal heaven or hell. - Selfish bastard! - Petit-bourgeois! First of all, I think the cinema is too rich. It's obese. It's reached its limits, its maximum capacity. It will explode if it tries to get any bigger! A mere blockage will shatter this fat-filled pig into a thousand pieces. I hereby announce the destruction of cinema, the first apocalyptic sign of disjunction, the rupture of this ballooning, pot-bellied organism known as film. - Anarchist! Films today have a finished, perfect, tranquil quality. This results from the harmony of elements in composition, a classical unity of constituent parts: word/image. One must divide to conquer. The youngest members of the family must be sent out as an avant-garde to try and clear a space for themselves in this new independent movement. Like in migrations or imperial conquests! Yes, we must destroy the two wings of cinema, sound and picture. - Butcher! We must break down this natural association that made speech the correspondent of vision or the spontaneous commentary born from the picture. I want to separate the ear from its cinematic master: the eye. I want to slap onto a film the sound of a roaring crowd, unrelated to what's seen onscreen. The pictures must proceed with indifference, irrespective to the terrible story in sound projected, hurled, into the obscurity of the theater. The link must be severed between the succession of images, coherent unto themselves maybe, but in no way coherent in relation to the sounds. - Rubbish! An intellectual's strength is limited by his field of reference; he is as much a creature of habit as a cow chewing the cud. Daniel's words were mangled by shouting from the auditorium... Up till now, words have merely commented on the image. From now on the image will become a relatively inessential complement to the screaming soundtrack! - It's not a scream, its a scram its a scam, it's a crime... - Shut up! Let him talk, you imbeciles! If you analyze any film, you'll see that it's composed of a series of images in which lightning-like strikes of dialogue punctuate the hero's visual gestures. I recently looked at a film dialogue: just like the intertitles in silent films, it made no sense without the image. From now on, I want the spoken mass of the film to be a rigorously precise surface, to the detriment of the images. Destroy the pictures for the words, contrary to what is usually done, do the opposite of what we believe cinema to be. Who ever said that cinema, whose meaning is motion, has to be the motion of images and not the motion of words? - Moron! - What will you do with the pictures, then? Pictures in cinema bother me for many reasons, you fools. Photos are already too banal! The different combinations of angles, of chiaroscuro, superimposition, soft focus... it all goes to show we must go further, beyond photography. We must attack the film material itself. - Ridiculous! - First, the images must rot! The room fell silent. Daniel did not seem so stupid after all, even to those who disliked his physical appearance. The fact that photography had shifted from its early precision to the artifice of special effects; from a copy of reality, as it was said, to artistic photography, from its reality to its monstrous unreality, replaced its clarity with a game of chiaroscuro, is a proof of its debasement, its obsolescence into uselessness. If you fiddle too much with something in your attempts to transform it, you extract its secret charms, you kill it! - That's what you do when you fiddle too much with your girl! Exactly! Think of the Marquis de Sade and his relationship with the weaker sex. The divine marquis knew so many "hot chicks" that his search for the unknown led him to a special form of love known as perversion. The more ugly, toothless, decaying, and disgusting the woman, the more he was attracted to her and excited by her love. The cinema has reached a similar point in its development, as has contemporary painting, with its impressionists and cubists; poetry, from Baudelaire to the Lettrists; and modern music. The more spoiled, perverted, and rotten the material, the more beautiful it is. The more mangled, gangrenous, and rancid the film material, the more precious it will be to the filmmaker. Creators are interested only in the novelty of creation! That's why they are obsessed with ugliness today; it's the new beauty. - Why go to the cinema to look for ugliness when you can just look in the mirror? - Shut up! - Fuck you! - Silence! Let him speak! I've no intention of telling you the story of my life! We're not in a confessional here. I remember, as a child, in one of my father's grocery stores I saw an ambassadors daughter come buy Roquefort, Camembert and Limberger cheeses. Looking at her, I was sickened to think that she could eat such putrid cheeses. The older the box, the more maggot-ridden the cheese, the greater her pleasure in acquiring it. We all thought she was crazy. And she was so serious, distinguished-looking, and blonde that her appearance lent a seraphic note to her craziness. As I grew older and my palate became more refined, I too grew to prefer Camembert, Roquefort and Limberger to yogurt and cottage cheese. I came to realize that it takes a great knowledge of and love for cheese to appreciate the ones that really stink! The same example holds true for cinema. I spent my youth in dark theaters, the modern equivalent of the opium den. I could have imagined a thousand realistic, unreal or pleasant stories. But it takes a great love for film and enormous amounts of raw stock... - Have you eaten much film, then? - Until I felt sick, but I'd rather be sick than keep a bad taste in my mouth... ­ That's a cop out! - It's also very difficult. Is it a perversion of language, or of the tongue? I may not be right, but the others will soon be wrong. In my search for renewal, I simply exhausted the possibilities before they did! While the others are still trying their chances with photography, I've given up on it: Im attacking the film material directly, destroying it, more moved by its madness than by its reason. Sadistic photography, that's it! - Youre just decadent! - Idiots! The evolution of art, of an artistic medium has nothing to do with the evolution of society. Sade wrote his books during the French Revolution, which was not at all a decadent period of our history it was the birth of a nation! - Hes a Democrat! - He must be Jewish! - Antisemite! - Shut up! - Fascist! - Go tell Stalin! - Go home to Truman! Cinema itself has led me to this cinematic rebirth! Words, for me, with their nuances and definitions, reveal the impotence, the limitation of the image! A text which refuses to take the image into account will enlarge the possibilities of photography, injecting the cinema with a Bogomoletz serum. In destroying the limitations of the cinematic image Ive destroyed it exactly as if I'd turned a frog into a bull. We'll find ourselves face to face with a bull. Excuse me, Mr. Bull, I didn't know you were a frog in a previous life! - Beat him up and throw him out! My films would concentrate primarily upon making language a supplement of photography - as if the sound was external to the image and did not emerge, as it has up till now, from the internal logic, the stomach of the image. Language will no longer emerge from the screen to coincide with its sequences, but from another place entirely: as if, in a very concrete and visible manner, it was an external addition unrelated to the image, a necktie of spit hanging from an ivory tooth as if the image prowled an invisible field, a place both supernatural and inhuman, from which a voice indifferent to humanity sends forth its oracles! Photography will thus gain a fourth dimension, but a fourth dimension of such force as to subjugate the other three - oppress them, flatten and destroy them! The enrichment of photography has thus led me to shred it, to chew it up... - Don't laugh, Mister mouse you could end up with a rat in your mouth. - This young man is right, you bunch of idiots! When the substance of an art form begins to decay, everything we express with it is decayed in advance. Our sensibility, our originality are useless when faced with the limitations of a banal means of expression which is in the end determinant: We must change the raw materials and the techniques of cinema if we want to communicate a new sensibility, an original sensibility. Why are you defending this cinematic corpse-robber? You scrap merchant of old film! Scrap artist, scam artist, scalp collector! Get lost, Figaro of the cinema! But, you bunch of cattle, you swine, you don't understand that my young friend Daniel - Hey Daniel, it's Pierre, I'm defending you back here! Don't you understand? What Daniel means is that cinema already has its masterpieces; that all that's left for us to do is chew on these masterpieces, to digest them and to vomit them up! Vomiting up old masterpieces is the only way for us to manifest our originality: puking out these masterpieces is our only chance to create cinematic masterpieces of our own. This is basically what Picasso did for painting, as the creator of swallowings and spittings of well-digested old paintings! Cinematic photography must thus enter its infernal phase, its evil phase! I've often been stunned and dazzled while thinking of the heights of refinement that the Marquis de Sade prided himself upon; eating his mistresses' fecal matter, adoring the excrement more than the women themselves... - Disgusting! - Sadist! Heights which I, alas, am far from attaining. But I know that cinema must nourish itself from the excrement of its own photography, or else it will congeal into the Pompeiian academism known as Hollywood, the USSR, or Italy. Foreign spy! Daniel thought that French culture was totally foreign to these idiots that he himself would look like a mulatto to all the fools of the world as one might say: "fools of the world, unite! Break your chains and destroy this foreign spy with no country to call his own" You're a bunch of idiots, but maybe there's one among you who understands. For him I digress! In terms of the photography, I'll fuck the film stock up with rays of sunlight, I'll take the outtakes from old films and scratch them, skin them, so that unknown beauties can see the light of day; I'll sculpt flowers on film and a new order will emerge from the disorder, just as Cézanne turned Impressionism into a museum art. I want a film which will really hurt your eyes like one of those old projections where the film breaks and burns and the numbers 1,3,5,7 appear at top speed. I've always loved the countdown; maybe because I associate them with the beautiful old classic films and my taste has shifted, from what I loved, to that which accompanied it! Yeah, right... thanks, thats a fine present! We should leave the cinema with a headache! There are so many films, every week, that we come out as stupid as we go in. I'd prefer to give you headaches than nothing at all! I'm not being paid by an optician to bring him clients, but I'd prefer to ruin your eyes than to leave you indifferent! But in the midst of this visual mess, voice alone will be coherent and terrible, until the day when creative and innovative research deforms it into incongruity! The spectator must leave the cinema blind, his ears crushed, torn apart by this disjunction of word and image: shriveled up in both departments. The rupture between language and photography will form what I call DISCREPANT CINEMA. I hereby announce the manifesto of discrepant cinema! Film that is lacerated, or voluntarily distressed by the film-maker will be known as a "chiseled" film. Youll piss off your audience! I don't think so, but if that's the case, to hell with spectators! I know whats up! Those who will particularly detest my film will be the camera operators, the professionals for whom the cinema has never been an art form but an industry unionized to defend the current means of production. But who ever said that cinema is an art for photographers? But if the photography doesn't matter, then it's not cinema any more, it's the radio, it's reading in an armchair... Why not? Radio, via television, has become a kind of cinema. Why should the cinema not, in return, become a sort of radio? You are right, sir. There is a continual displacement of the arts (poetry and painting have become music) a displacement which represents the enrichment of one art by another, or the abandon of certain qualities in favor of other arts... Daniel thought that he would always want to do something different; music as poetry, painting as novel, and now the novel as cinema: a novel read aloud by a ladys companion to spectators sitting in front of the burning fireplace of the screen watching sequences, like logs, fall and transform abruptly from incandescence to ash. We must age the public, cradle them with the voice, fascinate them with our stories or send them to sleep. But that's not cinema! But thats just it, if what I want to do is cinema already, theres no evolution; no conquest of territories that dont yet exist! If we always cling to what already exists, well never make any progress! If what Im doing is cinema already theres no merit in it, since it already exists. But my actions take their meaning from the fact that what I make was not cinema before, but, thanks to me, has since become cinema. But what good is evolution? The idea is not to make a film and play about with various techniques for ones own benefit, but to find out how the cinema can surpass itself, to open a path for it to forge ahead. Its not just about doing something new with one film; but, rather, indicating a whole new path for cinema to follow. Discovery, my friends, for good or bad, better or worse; but there's nothing bad about innovation Everything that existed in the past was bad, otherwise we would never have gone beyond it, we would never have renounced the past with revolution and radical change: everything that exists is bad! All we have is the future: creation, in other words; the struggle for something new. Nothing else can save us from mass suicide. I believe, stupidly perhaps, in a better future for humanity, I can overturn the art of the screen a million times, and more profoundly... Thats enough! But for the first film, thatll suffice... And Daniel left the room. He thought to himself: Thats my battle: Ill have to put my Cine-club spiel and the reaction it provoked among the eternal public, I'll have to put it all into my film! It will be the film to take cinematic posterity as its subject matter, auto-reflexive cinema, a cinema that produces original masterpieces, without resorting to "gimmickry." It will be the first cinematic manifesto to be presented inside a cinema. It is, moreover, the first time that the Cine-Club will participate in a film, that reflection or debate about cinema will be preferred to ordinary cinema in and of itself: Daniel arrived in Saint-Germain-des-Prés; it was the evening of 29th September 1950. He was full of joy and terror: the dregs of the debate had swelled, cultivated and developed his film-to-be. He could picture it in its entirety, from the opening title to the end credits. ON VENOM AND ETERNITY It will also be the first time that the credits will be visible not only in the middle of the film but all the way through, said Daniel to himself. This is the end of the first part. I hope you find the second part more amusing... In front of the Club Saint-Germain, Daniel's short-sighted eyes sought some kind of event capable of exalting or expanding his soul. The debate, the consistently rowdy incomprehension - (comprehension, on the other hand, being velvety, mute, less apparent), - their shouting had given him goose-pimples, as though his pores had been devoured by mange. After scouring the dark bar - more to be seen than to look for anyone in particular - he was on his way to the Bonaparte cafe when he got the impression that someone was calling him. - Daniel! Daniel! He turned around. - Daniel! Eve is looking for you. - Eve? - Eve! You know, the Norwegian girl... - Which Eve? He already knew. He pictured Eve, her stride which resembled that of an evil empress, cold as marble, like a sculptural image of war, the green seaweed of her green eyes, her mass of blond hair, which made it seem that she carried the sun on her aquatic head. She had haunted him for days, ever since he had met her at an art opening where he had spoken out, and been forcibly ejected by the owner, because he had previously insulted the "boss lady" in his newspaper. Eve had tormented him until the night of August 23rd, when he had left his room after an orgy of sleep, ready to grab onto the first girl who came along: "You or another..." he said to one of his dance partners, in an outburst of indifference; - any girl would do as long as she could make him dream, make him laugh. That night of August 23rd he had pinned his eye onto the blond headed figure with its back turned to him as though his gaze were pinned on like a ribbon. - Would you like to dance? - You seem to be alone. Without turning her head: I am alone and thats how Im going to stay He swallowed a bag full of aspirin and pee. Ah The whole place tasted of ashes, the dancers seemed to be shit-encrusted. He abandoned the place as one changes career, and went to try his luck elsewhere. - You or another... Since then he had often run into Eve around the neighborhood, his eye had been rinsed, washed of its vision: he had squandered the image of the young woman and guessed at the nostalgia she carried about from bar to bar, from bistrot to cabaret. She carried herself haughtily; like a movie star, hoping to provoke a cinematic adventure for herself, whereas a film can tell only one unique story, an adventure which by chance disturbs the life of its characters, a once-in-a-lifetime experience, similar to winning the lottery. Some weeks after the night of August 23rd, on the same day that the mysterious shadow had told him that Eve was looking for him, while he was talking in the street with a friend, Eve brusquely approached him. Was it you who asked me to dance, in the street, on the 23rd of August? Daniel hesitated. An ancestral memory warned him that he might be due a slap in the face. - Have I fucked up again? These girls are so sensitive... So he replied, hesitantly: yes She had prepared her reply in advance: I wanted to say I'm sorry; I really regretted being so impolite... What...? Im ready to make it up to you. I'd like to make it up to you. The words "make it up to you" repeated themselves on her lips and the decision with which she spoke mitigated her foreign accent, the gravelly impieties of her speech. He was dazzled by her sudden appearance, although he was not at all surprised; because a couple of times, at previous balls or dances, girls who had initially refused to dance with him for precise reasons (his conceited attitude, for example, or the friend sitting beside him ...) or for imprecise reasons, had changed their minds without explanation. He was thus in a permanent state of expectation: perhaps every man hopes for a reversal of fortune Face to face with Eve, all he could say was: - Oh, that's ok, don't worry about it... He turned to his friend, who was grinning lecherously Eve continued on her way; her rolling stride making each step seem like a specially prepared dish, the swinging motion of her hips spinning a spider's web. Now Daniel was standing in front of Eve, blinking his eyes, while she smiled at him with a slight air of timidity. Eve looked Daniel straight in the eye: - Would you tell me about your poetry? Daniel recoiled. So she knew, the bitch - the young man who had invited her to dance was not the same person as the young man she was apologizing to; local hooligan versus scandalous young poet, about whom the papers Yes, that's it. And what a stupid way to start a conversation, there's nothing I hate more than talking about my poetry, no more than I wanted to discuss my Judaism with the Spanish princess, to whom I made a whole antisemitic speech. There are certain secret things about which it should be forbidden to speak below a certain level, although I love discussing the Kabala with Rémi or with the Rabbi, I tell everyone else I'm just another student, a young fool who can only talk about women, dancing and movie stars, who doesn't give a shit, the ideal man, prestigious and powerful, who is sorely lacking from human society, impossible to hurt because he turns everything down But it was too late for that with Eve, she knew whom she was dealing with; she knew the ropes - Wouldnt you prefer to go for a walk along the Seine? I don't really like anonymous relationships, he thought. People hide behind a mask of words and attitudes, a mask that is only really shattered by the cries of lovemaking. That's why I hate relationships based on: "Hello, what are you reading? Hows it going?" We take full stock of ourselves only when faced with the ordeal of desire and the real woman, consisting of secrets, hidden dreams and nocturnal frankness reveals herself, her true face, whether beautiful or indifferent. Our relationship is formalized in this zone of truth, the starting point from which we can proceed to daily life; knowing what to expect from one another. Love has put our lives in danger, just as great books or great perils would do. If I can't stand talking to a woman I haven't slept with it's because I don't like cheating. "What should we say to each other, Madame? I don't know you at all." I don't like men, in general, the only thing I have in common with them is that I love their wives. Daniel was childish; when a woman resisted him, thereby his link with his fellow men, he hated her and all humanity. Now Daniel strolled along the banks of the Seine with Eve, and the Seine beside Eve was like the long funeral cortege of a member of officialdom, national funeral rites, black and silver, for a dead city, proceeding silently towards a faraway cemetery The Seine slept peacefully, curled up under the bridge like the ultimate beggar. Too bad it wasn't raining; rain makes people intelligent... The afternoon condescended towards evening and time seemed immense, that Sunday When Daniel spoke to Eve, he used the same tried and tested phrases that had for a long time served him as semaphores, guides or signposts of conversation, between which he threaded more spontaneous reflections, soaked, infected with the intelligence of his pre-prepared remarks. It's true, I do want to sleep with you. But I'm afraid you'll make a scene. Psychological complications, you know, have in todays world replaced conventional moral complications. If I could purchase you enjoy you without having to go through all the preliminary politesse out of consideration for your personality, etc "Personalities" and "individuals" piss me off What a pity there are no more slaves. Men will never get used to no longer having men at their disposal, men of exceptional quality. He recalled that in the days of Antiquity one could buy oneself a philosopher. - You're adorable, you're so spoiled, but don't you think that the poor, the slaves, could one day destroy people like you? Daniel thought about his expulsion from the Communist Party. The terrible sadness that he had felt that day reminded him of the day he broke up with Denise; abandoning his girlfriend had provoked the same feelings as the abandonment of his social beliefs. Much later, all that seemed derisory to him. But at the time he had felt that he was renouncing, being mercilessly eliminated from the only possible course of action, losing his health, as though incited to suicide. What was he to do? One is amazed to find oneself still alive the next day! You know, Eve, the Communists make me laugh. Let them enjoy their comfort for another couple of years. That's all I need to make a few masterpieces, maybe a film, something that I can save from the dribble and spit of electoral politics. And then I'll sweetly end my days in a political prison, I'll read detective novels from the prison library, the type of novel that I like. I'll dream Books, sleep and dreams of women will keep me going until I die. In any case, I will never, never, do anything that doesn't please me. If they don't let me read and dream, I'll go on hunger strike and die. They'll get you in any case. Who had said to him once? Anybody, innocent or guilty, anticommunist or communist, who doesn't expect a violent death to be shot or to die in prison, is a fool! No-one is master of his own destiny today. - You seem strong from a distance but in actual fact you're quite fragile. - You can say that again We say "we must confront life," etc. The truth is that I don't like life. I despise it too much to be able to stand it hurting me in any way. It's like letting myself be insulted by the concierge or by the grocer. I've always wanted to say to life: "who do you think you are, scum, fool to make me suffer like this?" And he laughed. They say you're a fascist. But I think that you're too human to be fascist. When I was eliminated from the Party, because I found my immediate superior too stupid (a girl who wore glasses and was riddled with complexes), I was furious, I wanted to attack her with vitriol. (She was too ugly for a gang-bang). My friends and I founded a literary revue with the following motto: We the founders of this review, three geniuses, offer our services to the highest bidders! But no one wanted us, no one needs geniuses, only faithful followers. We wrote in the revue: "We will one day be great men but we're sick of all those who encourage us with words, incapable of finding a penny in their pocket to give us. We want to be great men now, not in twenty years, when we are old. We are always twenty years too late to enjoy our own audacity, to laugh at our elders." They called us the valets of imperialism and then they invited us to rejoin the Party, because the Party needs leaders, but by then I'd tasted the pleasures of fighting for myself and not for others, I didn't want to any more... Who was it, that had said it to him? His fertile mind adapted their ideas to suit his own personal style. I didn't get along with them, because I don't like slogans. Politics, perhaps because of its dedication to doctrine, repeats and regurgitates certain formulas as if it takes men for newborn babies... Maybe I get bored faster than other people? When I was a child I invented new prayers every night. I always wanted different prayers. Truths that have to be repeated too often no longer amuse me; boring truths are nothing but lies, because theyve used up the warmth which made them pleasant to live with. You know, I've never done anyone any harm except for the usual indiscretions of childhood and young adulthood but today I'd like the right to think what I want to think, to take it as far as I want. At seventeen, at twenty, I thought that I could do something for other people, for humanity... But I later understood that there's nothing I can do, absolutely nothing no matter how hard I try. So now I just want them to leave me in peace with my weaknesses. You know, I never really liked selling the Party newspapers I was ashamed I preferred to walk in the rain or to go home and read André Breton, or Keyserling. Eve turned to him: - I always find men who don't share my ideas very unattractive. But I like you! So our ideas can't be too different, despite what we say... Daniel said to himself that he would not talk politics in his film, although he had wanted to show that he was well acquainted with it... Then Daniel and Eve's conversation turned towards themselves, towards love. Eve stared at Daniel as she would later when they were dancing in the corner bistro... A particular melody doesn't necessarily have to remind you of a beautiful woman. You might hear it with a very boring individual. But, since the melody is beautiful, you invent a love affair to go with it, a non-existent nostalgia, a sadness you have yet to experience. Music thus creates a memory of something you've never had, but which you would like to have had, an adventure to match the melody. During the slow set, Eve stopped abruptly. - I can't dance with you any more. It's having too much of an effect on me... Despite the "experienced" air of the women in our group, "young girls" still exist in the old-fashioned sense of the word, capable of stupefying emotion when faced with the most simple contacts, of a timidity which has survived the brash attitude of their peers; thanks to the influence of certain books and films the virginal modesty affected by the young girls of previous generations is as fiercely suppressed today as 'vulgarity' was in the past. Timidity is unfashionable, by today's standards... The tall young woman trembled in Daniel's jaded arms (jaded after years of dancing, of women). Unable to believe that her constant trembling was the result of emotion, he asked her: - My God, you're trembling. - Why are you trembling? She replied: - I'm sorry, it's just that I'm not used to dancing... And suddenly, as if relieved by this admission, she completely stopped trembling and began to dance calmly, to Daniel's great regret. Furious at himself, and at her, then, he found himself reliving a prior instance of oppressive self-possession when he had said to a young woman, during a waltz: - You're boring me, Mademoiselle, I find you very boring... He had left her there in the middle of the vortex abandoned among the couples, lost, wanting the earth to swallow her up - just like the little hunchback of the Moulin Rouge (if true, it's a dreadful story) who, when seated, looks normal, free of her defects. A handsome young man has just asked her to dance. Upon standing up, however, she reveals her monstrous deformity, crouching, shriveled up at his feet. Turning towards her partner on the dance floor where he had followed her, horrified, she found him gone. He disappeared into the crowd, preferring the short and heart-rending cruelty of escape to the torture of the dance - three dances, one after another, under the pitiless and despising eyes of the other dancers; the hunchback, in the middle of the dancers, entangled, dwarfed by the men's legs and women's skirts blinded by shame, feeling more observed than observing, irreparably lost to Daniel in the crowd just as he had decided to drop this girl who, having regained her self-possession, heard him say: - You were a lot better when you were trembling Now you seem so normal, so stupid and disappointing that you don't interest me any more... Abandoned on the dance floor, red with shame... he didn't know what happened next; we rarely see the results of our actions. He was all ready to drop Eve - "she's not even pretty" - when she stopped, as they turned the corner into a dark street (eternal pulp fiction heroine) and balanced herself on her hips, with fury: - Don't you like me, Daniel? Don't you want to make love to me? - Ohhhh, maybe... why not? Why not? She didn't believe in love either. But then night followed, sewn up with love, as one might thread a queen's veil with precious stones. But it's too precise a piece of work to have the right to discuss it here. In the morning, Daniel occupied such a deep place in Eve's heart, he had mastered Eve's body to such an extent; Daniel's frenetic and obstinate brain perfect even in the throes of an incendiary passion, seemed so conquering, so victorious and so exhausted by the satisfaction of his bottomless thirst that Eve was overjoyed; delighted that something about her body and her soul could still give pleasure to Daniel, that she could be of service to his joys, his thoughts. - I know it's stupid, but, if you want, I could stay with you all my life! Your life is all that counts... She said this the following night, at dinner, when Daniel, having stuffed his face, excused himself for a very bourgeois burp. - You can allow yourself all sorts of obscenities with me, darling, nothing could seem dirty to me, coming from you. That morning however, the first and only one they spent together the sight of this girl whose ordinarily stormy nature had been domesticated by fulfillment and by her love for Daniel, who had become pure and clean, who made herself small to fit into his arms, who molded herself into the Procrustean bed Daniel offered her, who even held her breath from fear of overstepping the limits of this tiny refuge, that she filled with the immense instability of her happiness. And watching Eve, who had become the woman who loved him with this animal passivity, a tiger reduced to a living bedside rug, Daniel's thoughts, gradually but determinedly, led him to Denise, the Denise to whom he had bizarrely attached himself one New Year's Eve after leaving Mimi drunk in bed. On the street, in front of Editions de Minuit - Hello Daniel. - It was Jimmy, his friend. - Come on, I'm taking you to a New Year's ball thrown by a whorehouse madam, said Daniel. - I want to pass by the Boul' Mich on the way to clear my head and, to be honest, in the incurable hopes of finding some sort of empty adventure. In front of the Dupont-Latin, in the midst of a crowd of people whom he hesitated to acknowledge, he saw a tall young woman with chestnut hair she turned towards him with laughing eyes, blue or green the color of a new and unfamiliar territory... - Wait for me a minute, I'll be back... He abandoned Jimmy... Daniel always abandons you for somebody else! How long can he keep going? What port will he dock at? He went to join the young woman; with the habitual banalities, a conversation as conventional as 'hello'; he persuaded her to abandon her plan to go to the Kentucky dance hall. Why does it always work out for him? Because he never remembers his failures. Our memories are victories. Our defeats belong to that mass of immensity, the absolute that escapes our grasp. Her name was Denise; he would crush her beneath his wheels. He found her thin, but she had a generous body. At the Kentucky, while they were dancing, a young man approached them: - May I kiss you, Mademoiselle? She turned to Daniel and, seeing the look on his face: - No, I'm with the love of my life... And she believed it. And Daniel believed it. And when he took her home, he thought: I want to do you good here (and pointed to her belly) and hurt you here (and pointed to her heart) It was an extraordinary night. He loved her so much, he sank into her body, he shed tears of love - the cynic, the hitherto aloof Daniel - - Who will love you like I do, Denise? It's crazy. Tell me, over and over again, those ridiculous words: I love you Daniel - I love you Daniel, I love you Daniel, I love you Daniel. When we hear these precarious words we shiver; we feel as if every word is splitting us open and shattering our soul. You know, Daniel, we search for the real person behind the facade beyond the labyrinth of words in which we can lose ourselves forever where all men go to die. How many corpses in the labyrinth of the dictionary? How many men clutch the bars of those corridors from which they can never escape, destroying themselves for the sake of a lover, dying of despair, smothered in the dungeon? The dictionary is full of corpses; a graveyard for those who died for words. When two people are joined by words and by those who incarnate those words when two people find each other, come together, who since birth and since the beginning of the world, have been divorced, the resulting collision is truly cosmic. All lovers write purple prose. Even in his dreams, Daniel shrank from it... - I'm sure that the same impulse that created this accidental happiness will take it from us, Denise; we count as nothing in this terrible trajectory; love is a mere child's plaything. But I adore you, Denise, even though I shouldn't be saying it. He remembered all that had happened, with Denise, after that first night, when he brought her to hear the zither music from "The Third Man" (which was making the rounds of the clubs) and then to the cafeteria at the Cité Universitaire, where they shivered side by side in the greyness of dawn. He found her so profoundly beautiful that he was afraid to look at her, afraid to find her inferior to his mental image of her. We only really see someone the first time we meet them. From that point on, we blur the image of the woman we love conforming it to the first image that we created of her. Mimi had said to him, sadly: You know, Daniel, a couple is such a difficult, such an impossible thing to realize that if we manage to achieve that unity it is a defining moment in our lives. You, Daniel, might have a chance of attaining that purity if you lose your status of womanizer and like the average man surrounded by solitude, concentric circles of silence through which love can penetrate only by means of a truly rare and difficult adventure. But this was followed by... Denise, you just don't understand, there's no easy answer for us. Suppose I stay with you, sealing our love with a cinematic kiss, The credits say 'The End' but the drama is just about to begin: the decrepitude of a shared old age, domesticity, children. Daily routine, wrinkles. It's a hell which exhausts all possibilities When we think of the love we shared we'll want to barf. I recently saw a newsreel of the golden wedding anniversary of a group of old people who had gathered for the occasion at the town hall. You should have seen those aging sweethearts. It was disgusting! All they shared was mutual decay! And even if, stating the impossible, love had managed to persist between them, and they had become blind to their own ugliness, used to the way they looked. In any case, one of the two either man or wife, will die before the other! The one who is left behind will be condemned to suffer the inevitable pangs of separation. That's what's in store for the love we share, if we stay together. There is another solution, the pain of an abrupt separation: "it was too good to last." The Catholics are right: when they say that mortal love in any shape or form, is a fall from grace. There's no difference between love and pleasure, since both are equally doomed to fail! But I hate love to the same extent that I love pleasure because the former involves my soul, which I prefer to keep free! He asked himself: should I drop Denise right away, should I tell her to leave - or should I keep going? His indecision tormented him. With Denise, for the first time in his life, he was afraid of a break-up, of the inevitable ending; and the more scared he got, the more he longed for the break-up, in order to overcome his fears, the more he crushed Denise with his arrogance, lacerated her with egotistical complaints. In the subway: In the end of the day, you don't give a shit, Daniel neither do I. That night was great, really great. I enjoyed myself, it was fun. We put on a good show, the two of us... The awkward stupidity of her words words that he himself said ten times a day, without understanding what he was saying caused him so much genuine suffering that at the next station, as she tried to take his arm while getting off the train, he pushed her away and spat at her: Fuck off and leave me in peace! He went to the cinema, alone; but everything he saw reminded him of him and her. Pierre had said to him: When we break up with the woman we love, on the way home we're stunned by the gleaming sword which twists in our wound. We savor the wisdom of this stupefying sadness, without finding the strength to go hunting for new adventures for a new girlfriend, as usual, to help us forget the last one; dumbfounded, fascinated both by distress and by its causes, by the novelty of the situation, we're borne aloft on a fever, which doesn't really bother us - the surprise is too great; what's incredible is the loyalty of our memory to the last hot body. All night long, he told himself: First thing tomorrow before she goes to work I'll call Denise and smooth things over with her. It seemed that the night would never end, he had to wait for the next day to carry out his plan. He was still awake at dawn, feverish, decided but so exhausted by his night of plotting and planning that he fell asleep as worn out as if he had been making love to a shadow. He had been struggling with Denise's angel and could go on no longer. His desire, thus delayed their reconciliation instead of facilitating it. It was two days later by the time he called her. When she came to the phone: - Is that you, Daniel? He recognized his own desire in the gentleness of her voice and the same expectation. The insatiable flame flared up again. He couldn't get enough of her body. He covered her in tooth-marks, bruises which she wore like the brand of a possessive owner. He robbed her, took her money... Does she love me or not, beyond the "daily bread" of her physical needs? He broke her down, drove her mad, tore her apart in order to feel himself inside of her, he wanted to be her downfall, he ravaged her in an attempt to burn himself into her memory. He became a part of her, installed himself inside of her; until the day that she invited him to dinner with a businessman friend of hers. Daniel was never fond of his girlfriends' male companions. The businessman took them to a stuffy restaurant; and since he complained incessantly of not having a mistress... - Rich men like yourself never fall in love; they're too busy making money, they've no time to look for love! And vice versa. - You might be right, young man, but when I invite a young lady to dinner and... - When I'm at the cinema and I see someone inviting a "young lady" to dinner in the hopes of sleeping with her afterwards, it makes me sick. If it were me, I'd invite a penniless young man, but one of the greatest, to dinner, instead of the "young lady" The spirit of poverty revolts within me, I feel parsimonious and miserly. I think if it were me, I'd sleep for free with the "young woman" and make her pay for dinner! - What a mentality... Daniel answered brusquely, with the intention to shock: (his interlocutor was the kind of man easily shocked by cynicism) You look like a pig! I've never seen an uglier face! Denise, get your coat on. And stay away from businessmen! She silently put her coat on - and then Daniel said sullenly: No, take it off, we're going to finish our meal, we're staying! Passively, gently (maybe cunningly, behind the facade, (taking a secret masochistic pleasure in her defeat) she removed her coat. He jerked the reins like an animal trainer (time for the reins to snap)... Whereas she, realizing the shamefulness of her slavery put her coat back on, in tears, clinging onto her love and to the blind, barbaric but unconscious brutality of her man. His selfishness, which razed everything around it endlessly self-obsessed, emerging victorious after tunneling like a mole into the subterranean resistances of his adversary, his triumphant muzzle emerging at last from the soul he had devoured; satiated, shouting victory "it was so easy, in the end"; his paws resting upon the remains of his prey, savoring his moment of triumph with a feeling of gratitude for the victim. With a cannibalistic pleasure of which Daniel never tired. The next day he waited for Denise's daily call. Silence. - Maybe she's sick? No phone call the next day, either. He was embarrassed to call her at work. She must be sick; I'll have to find out. He dialed the number: - May I speak to Denise? - Just a minute, please. He recognized the voice he was looking for: Denise, is that you? Yes, who's this? What do you mean, who's this? It's Daniel! Daniel? What Daniel? I'm not interested... Klak! She hung up the phone. Shit, shit, shit! He went back to his room, so exhausted that he lay down and cried. I'll make a film out of this misery. I'll make a masterpiece from what I'm feeling, ha! He spent three days in bed, rambling, satisfying himself, perhaps, with mechanical gestures, but rotting alone, rotting alone, rotting alone. On the fourth day the sun woke him up happy. He went out into the street, displaying his usual stupid happiness for all to see. When he saw the first reasonably attractive young woman pass by: - Hello mademoiselle, I've had my eye on you - and I thought that you might let me accompany you... You don't give a shit, Daniel, "could be her, could be anyone else"... her or another, her or another! How would you define love, Daniel? I don't know... When two hearts and bodies of equal strength come together, not just for pleasure, but also to savor the pride of eternal mutual possession or just for a moment... That's what you're searching for, every night, on the boulevard, as if you're looking for God - Love. Some people find a wife like that, some have brief affairs, and some people find nothing at all! Jean Isidore Isou, the author, wrote this chapter of the film in a moment of poisonous tenderness similar to those women who leave his room pregnant with an "I love you," born of his flesh and destined for no-one bursting with desire, like a fruit which no-one will bite into since it seems so far, so monstrous. However, re-reading these lines on a day of amorous supersaturation, he finds the whole chapter insipid. Nevertheless, the author knows that people come to the cinema for their weekly, Sunday, dose of tenderness and while he couldn't give a shit about the story, he'll tell it in the hopes of earning a well-earned success. He doesn't like these kinds of story; because they're merely a matter of personal taste. The systems or forms, which surpass the banality of these stories, are all that interest him. And now... here he is, in bed with Eve. He left her around ten o'clock; and arranged to meet her later that afternoon. They were to meet at a Lettrist recital. Like many others, he was interested in the sudden panic that was taking hold of poetry and music in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. For those who don't already know, the Lettrists are a group of young people who believe that words are obsolete and revoltingly banal, when used as an element of poetic emotion. The sonority of individual letters alone can combine music and poetry in an innovative potion which is closer to spontaneous sensation. Here ends the second chapter. Eve was waiting for Daniel in the basement, she had saved him a place beside her. Together, they abandoned themselves to Lettrism's mad orbit. They knew that the universe replaces old drugs with new ones, aware that every new message must be received with the ears of a child, not a donkey. "Marche" by François Dufręne Lettrist poetry is more popular than Surrealist poetry; it has even more of a social conscience than the best modern poetry. Try to read a surrealist poem, with its subconscious imagery! After two pages you're bored; you mark your place and try again the next day. But you can listen to Lettrist poems for hours. You can always be soothed by a pleasant rhythm focusing upon a broad concept which can be easily understood. It's a pleasure which requires absolutely no effort. "J'interroge et j'invective" an homage to Antonin Artaud by François Dufręne. Music itself, with the elimination of melody by Schonberg and the atonalists is evolving towards Lettrism! Lettrism will one day be more important than jazz which was dismissed, in its early days, as a half-caste music with no future. Jazz has been labeled as an outpouring of black primitivism. Jazz is fake primitivism! It's Americanized blackness, played on musical instruments, blackness disguised, masking its disgust with the use of mechanical instruments: trombone, drums, piano, "civilized" instruments. Jazz is primitivism in disguise! We must return to a genuinely free and savage state to a music and poetry of the intestines, to the purity of voice, the ancestral roar; the rediscovery of our original, explosive immediacy, to the barbarity of our vocal chords. Everyone naked! This is Lettrism! Our memories must be glued to these notes, our love affairs encircled by them. Our grandmothers loved waltzes, our mothers loved tango and we love jazz; because, respectively, our happiest moments have been accompanied by their rhythms. It's not the music that we love, in reality, but the memories that it awakens. For the public to learn to love Lettrism this strength must spread, it must inhabit our every footstep. At the end of the day, what's new is always victorious. Every generation needs fresh material - which has not yet been worked over by their elders - to attain self-realization. Daniel and Eve left the concert. Eve held him tight; Daniel's heart and the quays of the Seine were, that night, powdered with Lettrist arrangements. In one of the city squares, the birds on the grass were just as decorative as cows in the countryside. The neighborhood of Saint-Germain-des-Prés where writers meet to talk shop, like furniture sellers in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine or African Americans in Harlem; the same laws of professional concentration apply, this neighborhood, now labeled existentialist by stupid journalists whereas you'll find no one here but fans of pure jazz, (members of the international group of jazz lovers known as Zazous) Surrealist poets, Lettrists and ambitious young people looking to escape contemporary society, arrivistes ready to blow up the world, alienated young people. This neighborhood which idiots call 'existential', whereas here there is no worse insult than... - Yo, existentialist! - Shit! All the petty geniuses who distract you from the real geniuses who will, one day, become posthumously famous! All these alienated and ambitious young people... The cafes of Saint-Germain are like barracks for young people who crawl through the mud towards victory and self-realization like all the other soldiers, of all the other wars in the world... So many will be defeated in the end! Our victories bear direct relation to the capacity and the strength of our allies. We're victorious, when our own friends outnumber those of our enemies or those who remain indifferent. It's time to write the story of a different Christopher Columbus: with exactly the same name - Christopher Columbus - but who never succeeded in discovering America... Writers have lied to us in their books they spoke of a noble way of life that only the rich have the right to speak of. Their language makes us believe that writers are rich people, whereas they're almost all broke because real literature doesn't earn money. Writers are the only poor people who have the right to speak like rich people, but we have been decieved by our ambition to create masterpieces since it really is no more than the ambition to die hungry. Daniel's thoughts wandered. Eve kissed him from time to time, as if trying to rescue his lips from oblivion, his primitive means of self-defense. But Daniel was lost in his thoughts; and Eve's kisses, like the seasons of Paris came and went without disturbing their harmonious curves. Words, language... I think that other people have also worked with out-takes from old films, don't you think so? Maybe, other people have also used out-takes, but they edited them into a coherent whole, they organized these out-takes into a logical, coherent montage. I'm going to be the first to abandon myself to these scraps of film just as Dostoevsky abandoned himself to his fall from grace. I'll transform into nobility that which has been, up till now, considered squalor. By the same token, the images and comparisons which, in Victor Hugo's poetry were consolidating elements have, for the Surrealists become a source of dissolution. For example: Eyes used to be compared to flowers, in order to better praise their beauty. The Surrealists compared eyes to flowers, to make you forget the eyes and lose yourself in that comparative flow of objects which pours out from the use of comparison. It was, if you like, the same technique, but a different principle defined the two procedures. Between the possibilities presented by the use of out-takes to date and my way of using them, I'm sure that there is as big a distance as that which separates Victor Hugo from the Surrealists! But between the two attitudes modern art is formed. Cinema is called a modern art, but has created nothing up till now but primitive masterpieces. Modernism does not yet exist, in film. Modernism will begin with the destruction of cinema. Maybe right now... Then again, there are so many things involved that I can't go into now. When we destroy the basic principals of an art form, the secondary elements fall apart by themselves. Take, for example, the very anti-cinematic style of my scenario: the long, torturous phrases which break with the short propositions, the simple, indicative and active style of scenarios up till now. I am the first to use the same long phrases in film that Marcel Proust took from philosophy and was the first to use in his novels. To take another example: up till now, the protagonist was shown turning towards his partner; his gestures were fully visible. From now on you'll hear "Daniel turned around" without seeing him turn. We'll incorporate imagination into the cinema since we're destroying concrete reality. The spectator can invent the protagonist for himself, for the first time in the history of cinema. After a moment of silence, Eve condensed his long chain of thought into a single link: The actors' images will bear no relation to your scenario as if you'd taken the mock-ups and the sequences of a film, and, using these scenes, instead of editing, you'd got bored with a performance whose outcome was known in advance. As if this bric-a-brac represented the boredom the film already inspires. As if this boredom was already the destruction of cinema. You'll show that images are irrelevant, that you can make them say whatever you want, and that which they don't say in reality. When all images are equal, they are all equally indifferent. Did you know that Mme de Charričre told Benjamin Constant that God had existed, but that he died during the creation of an incomplete universe. She said: the universe that you see is nothing but the scaffolding of a universe that will never be built. This film will never be built, at least not as films used to be. If I've correctly understood you, Daniel, the God of cinema is dead, according to you, the volcano of original unity extinct. Only detritus and chunks of frozen lava roll down towards us. I know that others have already destroyed photography, But you're the first to have understood the necessity for this destruction. Others before you have destroyed photography but they did it by accident: and then abandoned the job and went to work on something else. You're the first to understand that the destruction of the photography is the only possible way for it to evolve. Daniel had run into his friend Pierre that same morning, accompanied by the stranger whom they had met at the Cine-club. They had discussed Daniel's film. - You know, Daniel, what those idiots at the Cine-club don't understand is that the cinema has exhausted its capacity to create masterpieces. Discarding the existing masterpieces is not an option the best we can do is to use our intelligence to use the parasitic intelligence of these masterpieces of the past to turn them inside out, to demonstrate that we understand them. Our predecessors were fortunate enough to start with an empty playing field to move around in: that's why they chose a cinema of action, epic cinema. We however, luckless disciples, late arrivals, we have nothing in front of us as raw materials, than the memory of this cinema of action, the criticism or defence of preceding actions. Our films can be no more than simple commentaries, conscious or unconscious, of the films of the past The storyline of your film may be banal; tomorrow's film-makers will, however, be able to tell any story they want using your system of discrepant cinema indifferent to whatever appears on the film strip itself, anyone who has a story to tell can make a film without spending any money on film stock. The image is too elementary, too simple! Hence the impression of stupidity given by silent films which were obliged to tell stories that the novel had already abandoned with shame! Even Chaplin was merely a primitive clown. King-Kong, cowboys and kisses in close-up this is what action photography has been reduced to. Even "Battleship Potemkin," Eisenstein's Soviet masterpiece, is a sort of King-Kong of revolutionary ideas, an anecdotal account of primitive revolt. Language is the only element of the world of expression that can embrace all the world's nuances. Language alone is as complex as man and rich with all the treasures of human ambiguity. The stranger intervened: - It was really fantastic, Mr. Daniel. After you left we spoke about you a lot. You are the first to deal with the problem of language in film; until now, the image was all that counted; language was a mere subordinate without interest, of what is called 'cinematic style'. Your type of film may be one of the most intelligent in cinema history. In any case, only discrepant cinema, as you call it, can create the most intelligent film in the history of cinema We had a fine discussion after you left! Those idiots told me that making the most intelligent film ever with sound and language is cheating, since the cinema is, after all, primarily photographic. I answered that in destroying photography Daniel turns it inside out and makes it more intelligent than ordinary photography, since destructive photography is superior to ordinary photography otherwise it would not have the power to destroy. You have to be stronger, superior to someone in order to beat them and break them down. A film like Daniel's will thus be the most intelligent film of the history of cinema, not only from the point of view of language and sound, as you say, but also from the point of view of the image. You know, after you left, we talked a lot at the cine-club. I told them that although other people may have already used similar techniques, their attempts were mere games, mere farce: that they had made no connection between their games and the necessary evolution of cinema. I gave them Picasso as an example! Before he came along other artists had already destroyed the image, any child could imitate Picasso by destroying an image but he was the first to take the beauty of conventional painting as his starting point and, after infinite research, with great difficulty, progress towards the destruction of conventionally beautiful painting. He systematized a new approach to painting and forged a path through the forest of painting which leads from ordinary figurative art towards abnormal art. The same goes for Alfred Jarry, the author of "Ubu Roi". We know that Ubu Roi was a mere college farce: that it was Alfred Jarry's friends who staged the farce but it was Jarry himself who cut a path through the jungle of the conventional literature of his day, a path that leads from that beautiful literature to the college farce. Alfred Jarry spent his life clearing and systematizing the path which leads from beautiful literature to the college farce. In your case, Daniel, the 'cinema - within-cinema' manifesto must be a knife possessed of inhuman strength, thanks to which the youth of today can beat a path for themselves through the stifling stupidity of cinema towards a new territory devoid of farces. You must arm the cinema with a weapon, a sword, such as it has never known! America existed before Christopher Columbus but only Christopher Columbus could force a way for Europeans to reach that America; an intelligent path. Your film must be sufficiently intelligent to constitute a Northeast Passage for cinema a map towards a new exoticism. I told them that if you had created nothing new then no one had ever created anything new, neither Picasso, nor Griffith, nor Chaplin, nor Baudelaire, nor Rodin, nor Descartes nor Plato; since there's always been something for people like these to be the first to grasp and systematize. It's nevertheless strange, Daniel, There will be a continual displacement of values in your film! You'll use photography to make people pay attention to sound. You could even tell a love story in order to remind yourself, discreetly, of another love story. Rarer and more precious. And it's funny, you extol the use of language as a way to upset photography and yet you love Lettrism, which is the destruction of language. What you are really interested in is the creative process, invention, discovery: that is, fundamentally, what creation consists of an incessant destruction of surfaces in order to access the turbulence beneath them. They'll say that I had no difficulty in shooting this film but it took years of film-making to provide such easy access to the footage I've collected, from all over. They'll call my film clumsy but there's no such thing as a perfect work of art; the cinema has arrived at that point where the uniqueness of an art form is to be found precisely in its clumsiness, just as modern music has transformed old dissonances into the harmony of jazz. When I think of what my film will contribute to all aspects of cinema: (A) A new photographic technique: "chiseled" or rotten photography. (B) A new and original type of scenario, where language explains the invisible. (C) A new style of discrepant montage (D) An new way of envisaging the cinema: cinema as the esthetic of cinema. Those idiots will, of course, complain about me again but I know that even if the film is superior to all pre-existing films, I know that I'm superior to my film and that I'll never stop doing more and doing it differently. - Your spectators must remember, not forget, Daniel that you've even invented the music for the film by yourself. I'm speaking about Lettrist music. They told that me you don't know the meaning of cinema. I replied: Daniel will invent the cinema; it's not cinema that's going to invent Daniel. To avoid all ambiguity, I told them: We must first let ourselves be invented by an art form; in order to subsequently reinvent it ourselves. Riding his ideas for the cinema like a winged horse, Daniel passed over into the land of twilight. A red ant crawled into the eye of the night: it was the first street lamp lighting up. Now, with this Eve, whom he didn't like very much, he had to begin the night all over again! In his impatience, he had exhausted his desire for Eve just like those sweets which he had never been able to suck on, to hold in his mouth and enjoy, as he was told to as a child instead he crushed them quickly between his teeth and swallowed. (you never chew, darling, his mother had remarked). Impatient to arrive at the apex of pleasure, as fast as possible, at its summit, just as he always knocked his drinks back in one go, then cried: my stomach hurts, Mommy, I can't stand it, I can't stand it. In bed, beside Eve's sleepy body, he felt that he was almost satisfied; he searched for the cowardly words with which to tell her she had to go. I'll always love you, Daniel. You scare me a little the heavy brain you all carry within your adolescent bodies... The heavy brain behind the adolescent face. The princess used to say the same thing; and Mimi, Jeanne and Rémi used to say the same thing. I want to be faithful to you forever, I'll never leave you. Forever... Never! You know, I think you're fooling yourself about the future of our relationship. I don't have time I can't see you any more... not tomorrow, never! Daniel! But Daniel! What do you want from me? Did I do something to upset you? Tell me, darling what did I say wrong? Didn't I do everything you wanted? Just tell me how you want me to behave! Eve, I'm not the sort of young fool who thinks he's conquered the world as soon as he has a woman on his arm. I know very well that love's not enough for the young... but you always want to conquer the world! You're annoying me now, I'd like you to leave... Daniel! I can't leave like this... Are you throwing me out? You're compromising me and you're throwing me out! You're not thinking... the people who've seen us together, what will they say? Even the concierge will laugh at me! Their petty concerns... the concierge... people like that, dependant upon the opinions of others, lacking any feelings of their own, anything which would allow them to surpass or despise anyone else, for whom the hatred of one man or the love of another is more important than the shit they see in the street, formed entirely by the hate or the sympathy of their neighbors. Never themselves, always the neighbors. When I meet people like you, if only you knew how I spit on you all! Humanity... He hated her and longed for solitude. He saw himself at ten years old, slapping his younger sister because she was playing with two poor children. As he chased them away, he heard their widowed mother shout at him furiously: You're chasing my daughters away, my little orphans, because they're not as rich as you are. God will punish you and make you more miserable than they are. Placid, indifferent - a small, timid, surly monster - he had already foreseen and refuted those conventional phrases, thanks to his precocious reading, before they had even appeared in the widow's vulgar brain. A friend of Daniel's had remarked one day: You're like a spoiled child! It's true that I'm a spoiled child; I always will be. Spoiled children, when they leave their parents, cannot resign themselves to a world that doesn't spoil adults! They're at war with the world. While others resign themselves and conform to the world, spoiled children spend their lives trying to bend the world to their will. Think about it for a moment and you'll see. Everyone who has changed the world began as a spoiled child. I'm telling you the truth, the world will either belong to spoiled children or be devoured by misery and resignation. You might be right, Daniel, to despise mankind. All those who wanted to transform mankind began by hating it - otherwise they would never have wanted to transform it Christians wanted to render it worthy of paradise... Even Marxists who pretend to love it want to destroy it to change it and Nietzsche... You must really love mankind, to detest it to such an extent... You don't understand, Eve; you inspire a lot of pity in me, for eternally valid reasons; believe me, you all do. I feel like a philanthropist in front of you all... You want to defy the world, Daniel! But you'll be hung and spat upon by the populace that you despise. Like Mussolini... What ferocity, all of a sudden! Like that other stupid young woman who I hadn't been able to, or hadn't wanted to satisfy. One evening, at a restaurant, I saw a couple right in front of me. The man must have been about fifty. The woman sitting beside him was about thirty five or forty, beautiful, with the youthfulness of a well-kept woman. I stared at her impertinently; and she turned towards me and smiled, complicit. I was so brazen, so young that her heart must have warmed itself at my fire. The old man sitting beside her looked up; he looked at me, with an expression on his face of distance, amiability and wisdom with the immense luxury of sympathy. A look that I ignored, indifferent, preoccupied by the woman alone like a young wolf or tiger who coldly crushes everything with eyes for the flesh of his partner only. Years later, however, the look on the face of this young fool who wanted me for her pleasure alone, the wild look in the eyes of this young woman, suddenly, terribly, reminded me of the look in my own eyes, back then; and the current look in my eyes resembled that of the old man. I understood his disaffection, his arrogance and his 'couldn't give a fuck' smile. Something just as tranquil, ironic and friendly as one often finds, if one looks carefully in the faces of the old presidents of the Republic, the understanding and bonhomie that I despised as a young man and that I now know how to read and love in the eyes of people who seem to be at peace with themselves in the midst of the world's madness. Let me stay with you tonight, Daniel... You shouldn't have dragged me into this game of love Now that I've assumed the role, I'm capable of carrying out any role you choose. Even suicide, if that's what you want. I don't know how to get out of it. Let me sleep beside you tonight... You won't see me tomorrow. I need love... I can't be with just anyone even if you throw me out. If, one day, you want me let me know, I'll come! I'm at your disposal, Daniel! Daniel's thoughts were limited to his own personal satisfaction; in his mind, he embraced all the millions of women in the world. The Mimis, Fifis, Margots, The Denises and Ingrids. The desire to be unique - or at least to be alone possessed him like a madness 'It's time for her to go, she has to go!' Eve saw the look in his eye and without saying a word jumped out of bed, She got dressed very, very quickly and left, slamming the door behind her. My film's almost finished, at last. In the end, it's nothing but the story of Eve and the thoughts that she inspired. I often saw Eve again, in and around Saint-Germain-des-Prés. The bodies of the women we have loved are reclaimed by the street and become as foreign to us as if we had never slept side by side. The fact that we've kissed these beings seems as unlikely as it did when we were sleeping with them. The strangeness, the coldness and the timidity of our first encounter seem naďve to us. These women are once again devoured by society, which turns them into statues before our very eyes. To finish off Eve's story: This young woman, to whom people paid less and less attention developed mannerisms to make herself more interesting. One night she raised the alarm because of a stray dog in a city square. Her presence no longer enough to attract attention, her gestures became more and more disproportionate to her surroundings. She went slowly mad, like an aging spinster because, socially, she adopted attitudes that are seen as original or crazy. She still had the beauty and youth to hide the phenomenon but you could already see the crazy old lady lurking within her. Her mind had been pushed in such an opposite direction to what we call intelligence; that she slowly became ridiculous. When Daniel passed her in the street, he ignored her. One day, sitting outside a cafe with a friend, he saw Eve, between two plain-clothes policemen, walking towards a squad car. - Look, Daniel, there's Eve! They're going to deport her, she's going back to Norway. She's been acting crazy The friend ran over to Eve to shake her hand, say goodbye. Daniel stayed put, silent, looking in the opposite direction. - Damn you, Daniel! - I don't give a shit! Half an hour later, a man came into the cafe, looking for Eve. Eve? They've just deported her. Deported her? I've stuff to give back to her. Daniel approached him: Do you know Eve well? Yes, of course, but why? Do you know her intimately? Yes... but... Very intimately? Did you sleep with her? Yes! But why? Oh... nothing. I just wanted to check. His friend laughed. Daniel just wanted to know who had succeeded him. He put 5 francs in the billiard machine. Daniel thought about his film... My film will be called "Spit and Eternity," or "Spit and Marble" or "Spit and Steel"; it will delineate the gap between the dusty state of our language and the extent of its true potential. I'll draw attention to Nietzsche's phrase: 'only inner chaos can give birth to a dancing star' My film will be like a Hell composed of circles. The first circle will consist of my ideas about the cinema of my desire to make a film to describe these ideas; below that will come the circle of Eve and, below that, the circle of Denise, Rémi and Lettrism, closest to my heart. My film will be a manifesto for my future films, a preface for films to come, a concentration of themes, like Cocteau's "Blood of a Poet." My future projects will revisit each theme systematically, developing each theme with more clarity, more purity. My first film will be the core, the promise of things to come. As opposed to my published writings, I want my films to be devoid of rage: calm and full of reconciliation, if that's possible. Eve must be at the station, between two policemen... But I can't do everything. I have to lose some ballast. I will never, ever accept their love, their good or their evil they can only offer me that which already exists and which is bad by definition: mortality. By Daniel's side, his friend scored thirty thousand on the electronic billiard machine, which gave him the chance to start over, for free... This film was originally four and a half hours long. It was reduced to its current length for "practical reasons." It's duration still seems to me today too limited to contain an "experience" and at the same time allow its author to be "intelligent." A single film cannot give an account of the values of a system that encompasses millions of possibilities. In this piece of work, the spirit of rupture preoccupied me more than the accomplishment of obligatory goals. Inspired by this film, disciples and friends are already envisaging works that are so "monstrous" that they will definitively change the appearance of cinema "per se." Dishonest critics will attack my "subject matter". There's no such thing as a universal "story"! Superficial young women, who prefer passionate drama, are bored by gangster films; my generation laughs at the tearful romances of our parents. Certain idiots accuse Proust of using a "boring" style of writing to describe the boring events of the world of "high society." The essence of the film depends upon education, temperament, personal vision and other contradictory phenomena. These should not be used as criteria for judgment. This is, in any case, as far as the scenario can take us. After these long and complicated sentences we will at most know how to destroy language; we must attain Lettrism, which already exists here, as invented by the author. Because the mere composition of poems and stories never satisfied me and because I always wanted to invent new forms for the stories I was telling, because, in other words, I have always imposed an extra task upon myself, legalists and intellectuals have attacked and insulted me to the point of stupor. All that's left to do is to ask you on the way out if this film is worth at least as much as any gangster film love story or documentary which the critics of cinema consider "most reputable."
