She took everything and left. At least she has a roof over her head. Enough. He's here. Get ready. Leila, why are you running like that? Think you're going to your father's orchard? Good morning, boss. I brought another girl to work. - If she can work, bring her along. - Yes, don't worry, she does. Good morning, boss. - Good morning. - Got any work for me? - No, none. - Why not? - None for you. - Why is everyone working for you, then? Because they work hard, not like you. Let me go work with them. I have to earn a living. You are a troublemaker. Hneya, hurry up! I'm doing my best! - Good morning. - Good morning. Your heart... - Good morning. - Good morning. Hold this for me. Thank you. Good morning. How are you? You afraid we'll be seen? Let people talk. - They can see us from behind. - Let them watch. They're already talking, don't make it worse. What are they saying? That I ride in front and everything... Silly things, as usual. Let them talk, if it makes them happy. I'm sick of all their noises in the back. Once we worked for a guy who was such a bastard that he'd pour water in the back of the truck so that we couldn't sit down. We would all stand, packed in, so he could take more people. - Are you serious? - I swear. And this isn't part of it? This orchard is difficult to watch over. It's very big. How do you expect me to watch over everything? Between the boars here, the motorcycles over there, the cars... See what they're up to and get them to leave. And down the bottom there are guys who come to get wasted. Nothing but trouble. We need another guard to help. - You know that I'm losing out, here? - Losing out how? - A dead loss. - But why? Have you seen how many workers I have already? How else do you expect me to do this work? The orchard is big and it's not fenced in. If it were, it would be easier. But here it's open on all sides. There are crates in each corner of the orchard. How do I do this? You need to hire another person or two. Maybe he went that way. You should have seen your sister... You wouldn't have recognised her! - How did I miss that? - Because you were busy with the boss. - You and the boss can get lost. - I swear! He got in the truck with us. And your sister, when she saw him... Her face went bright red. And she was shaking. - I still feel my heart fluttering. - Me too. You know he's like a little brother to me. Wait for me. Which way did he go? I don't know, maybe that way. - Come on, get a move on! - Hurry up, the boss is making his rounds. Abdou... - Yes... Hello. - Hello. Where have you been? I'm here. How are you doing? I'm fine. We moved to Monastir. We live there now. What about your brothers and sisters? Everybody is fine. - And what about you? - We're fine. You? All is well. What a coincidence... Five years later. We find each other here. Who would have thought... - Everything happens for a reason. - Everything happens for a reason. Not a word from you... You didn't look for me? You've changed. We've all changed. Even you. I looked for you. For a long time. I know. Well, I'll let you get back to work. - We can talk more later. - Okay. Ghaith. Ghaith. Listen. Listen. Put those down. Put the crates on the ground, I'll show you. - I only have two hands. - I know that. All you do is talk. - Can't you take them like that? - But the branches are low. - What? - The branches are low. Lower your arms and it'll work. Count them. Nine. I'll take one. You cut the leaves like this. You spread them out well at the bottom. You put the figs on top so that they don't get damaged. See this one? It needs a few more days. - Touch it. It's not ripe. - Right, it's hard. You pick the ones that are ripe. The ones that are soft and dark. Be very careful with the branches. If the figs are too high, don't shake the branches. This is how you do it. You take your stick and pull gently. Breaking a branch is like breaking an arm. Take the stick. Where do you live now? In Monastir. In Monastir? And for now, you're at your uncle's? No, I'm staying with a friend. - You don't remember me? - No. You've grown up. You're a man now. I knew you when you were little... I knew your parents. Same valley, same family. May they rest in peace. Do you understand how to do it? Yes, don't worry. I'm good. Pick this one. Did you go to the wedding last night? I'm not a belly dancer. You think you are better than a belly dancer? Leave me alone. - Don't you have a big stick? - No. Yours is long enough. Spit it out. Have you seen Firas? You think I'm living with him? That's God punishing you. We need to hide this one from the boss. If he sees this, he'll give it to you. If you don't rat, he won't know. I'm not a snitch! You're really no fun. I'm going to switch to another tree! Go ahead, leave me in peace. Broken. One minute, Leila, please. Yes? - Did you see or hear anything today? - No. - Nothing at all? - No, nothing. The guard told me there was a robbery last night. Up there. What do I have to do with the thief? - You don't know who he is? - No, I don't know anything about it. I didn't think a story like this would escape you. Tell me, which of the boys are the closest? I need to know who's screwing with me. - You didn't see anyone up there? - No. As usual, the boys, one by one. Don't hide anything from me, please. I swear, I don't know. I've only seen them working. It's got to be two of them. One keeping watch, the other stealing. And not someone from the outside. I have no idea. We didn't get to this part yesterday. It was meant for this afternoon. - Understand? - I don't know anything. There are no more figs. Are you all right? And you, how are you doing? - I haven't changed. You haven't either, you've just grown. Your hair... just the same. You were taller than me. I was taller than you, you remember... That's life... You left a void. You too. We never forgot about you. I cut ties with everyone. Not just with you guys. I tried to forget about this place. And Melek, what's up with her? What do you mean? I don't know... She suffered a lot. She thought about you a lot. She almost went on the show "Lost and Found" to find you. Just imagine it. Here we are, finally at this historic moment. Firas. Where are the crates? Give them to him. See if there are any ready. Give him the full ones, Amara. They aren't ready. They're worse than Romeo and Juliet. It's like she's the first person to fall in love. She dreams of him, makes eyes at him. He must have ten girls like her. Love is not that simple. There you go again with your theories... What theories? This is the first time I've seen Melek like this. Love is a lie. The real relationship begins after marriage. You mean you get married first and then love each other after? No, in the beginning you have love and passion. But it's after marriage that you get attached. But nowadays... Stop talking nonsense. You stop it! You don't know anything. Are you even old enough to be talking about marriage? I'm 17 years old. I can imagine you married to the handsome Firas, stylish, well-built... I'm going to change him. People can change. Maybe God will soften him up. I have to guide him, so that he becomes... the man I want. It's about his mentality. I want him to be closed-minded. - Closed? - Yes, closed. But Firas is fine the way he is. Open-minded. I don't think so, I want him to be more conservative. I want him to be like how I imagine him. Yeah, right. You don't know. If he loves me, he'll listen to me. If he doesn't love me... - You'll have to listen to him. No, if I tell him to do something, he has to do it. Shut up, that's nonsense. - You're the one who has to obey. - Yes, sure... What do you mean, "sure"? Enough, Firas is fine the way he is. If he changes, you won't like him anymore. Why are you so insistent? I like him and I'm sure of it. - You know nothing about love. - I do! As if you know any better? - Lower your voice. - I'm being quiet. Are there any more over there? Come on down. Should I hold the bucket for you? No, don't jump! Should we move to the other tree? Wait, there are two more there. The boss, is he good with you? The boss? He's good with good people. He's a jerk with the jerks. Ah! And is he good with you? It depends. He seems nice to you. - Abdou! - Yes? What are you getting at? I'm just asking. Abdou! I know you. He acts differently with you. Not like with the others. Anyway, I don't trust men. It's not the first time I've been in a relationship. So you're going out with him? - No! - What is it then? I swear I'm not. But he is... I don't know... So there is something. Yeah, he calls me and everything, but I don't know. Why? Just curious. Abdou! You've been gone five years but I still know you well. I can read your eyes. How long have you been working for him? I've been working for a long time. Not just with him. But you know... A lot of things happen in the orchards. That's why I don't trust people anymore. Last year or the year before, there was a boss who was harassing this girl, I'll skip what happened afterwards... She had an abortion and everything. That's why you have to keep your guard up. There is always drama. You can't trust anyone. He's always got his eye on a girl. You can't tell who he really wants. He's like a stray dog. But he's cute. Crazy girl. - Let's get back to work. - Stay. I'll tell him I'm with Fidé, he won't say anything. Drop it. Let's get back to work. So you're with Fidé. You literally just got here, smartie. Some things never change. Little sneak. They're still green. Who's picking the green ones? Stop picking the unripe ones! You're pissing me off in the morning. Look at this. This is not work. Firas. Yesterday you weren't feeling well, today you arrive late, why? It's nothing. I had some stuff to do, that's all. I figured there was a problem. No, I just have some things to take care of, that's all. Can I know what things? No, you can't. Why not? I tell you everything. Some things are meant to be shared, others not. - Not even to me? - No. He's changed so much. Of course he's different after all he's been through. At least he's holding on. That's true... losing both parents... But... You thought he was going to come to you and talk in front of everybody? And tell you about what happened to him? He could have taken me aside. And why would he tell you? Because I'm his ex-girlfriend. His ex-girlfriend. My heart hurts when I think about it. Your heart is too weak. What can I do? Try to talk to him, see if you still have feelings for each other. But men aren't everything in life. I've had enough. Love... This is bogus. I gave it my best shot. And what did I gain? A few good beatings. Leila, I was waiting for you. My neck was starting to hurt. The bucket is full. That's good. I advise you to only think about your own future. Even before you get your high school diploma. I'm heading down, you do what you want. Think about what I said. And figure it out. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. What's with you today? Nothing, I just have one thing to do, I'll tell you later. No, tell me now, I want to know. No, now is not the time, I'll tell you later. I don't feel good about this. Why? Is there another girl? Come on, no. I'm preparing something. - Give me a clue. There's money at stake. Money, you say? Listening to you, sounds like you're about to become a CEO. Sana, the CEO's wife. Yes. Sana, the CEO's wife. How are we going to see each other when school starts? Don't make me think about it, I'll miss you so much. We can meet in front of the school. - No, not in front of school. - Why not? My family goes to the cafe across the street. So where will we meet then? I've been thinking. How about the Aziza supermarket? See you at the Aziza. - Why not. Why not. - Really? - We can meet wherever you want. Nobody knows us over there. We'll stand in a corner. Aziza or wherever... - In the yogurt section. - Why not? It's cold by the yogurts. - It's cold by the yogurts. - We'll see. It's up to you. Now's not the time to be on your phone, Fidé! He won't do anything. If he sees me, I'll say it's Dad. Where do I put this? You still don't know where to empty your bucket? - There are no empty crates. - There are plenty! Put them there. We can't say anything to you girls! You, you just grumble all day long! Where's the boss? What? We can't tell these girls anything. - Don't talk to them, then! - Look, it's her or me. Don't talk to them anymore. They're rude. - She knows them. - They have smart mouths. Can you hear them? This one, you can feel it's going to break. Don't pull. Can you do it like that? - Almost. - Careful! It broke. - Is this the last one? - Almost. You traded me for Firas? - Mariam. - Yes. - Why are you mad? - I'm not mad. You don't want to work with me? I work with everybody. You seem annoyed. We're like brother and sister. Not at all. I can't believe this. Here, he told you to fill this. - Who said that? - The boss. But it's already full. - Add a little more. - Add another quarter. Fill up this one first. - The boss is going to yell at us. - It fell off on its own. God, give me patience. Give me two big leaves. Don't do that, put them there. No, give me that. - We can bury them. - No way. You just have to do it well. We'll say it wasn't us. I'll throw them far away. Come here. Where are you taking that? Where? - I'll throw it over there. - Where did you get that from? - It broke off the tree... - It broke off the tree? This is the second time. I didn't do it on purpose. I don't want to hear that anymore! What's wrong with you?! Everybody is picking, but you're the only one breaking branches! You're useless! Go home! I didn't do it on purpose. Give it to me. Drop the bucket. Go home, I said! I don't want you here anymore. - Get gone. - I'm sorry, this is the last time. You've said that a thousand times! Go home. Look at me! - You're not getting paid for today. - Why not? You won't get paid. We'll talk about it. You, keep working! Take that away. And come back for these ones. Firas. Do you still need the stick? Two seconds. Give it back to me afterwards. There are some. I'm looking for the big ones. Put them there. Put them there. Hurry up. Take this one, Sana. What's wrong with her? Yosra! What's wrong with her? - Yosra! - She fainted. Hold her up. What's wrong with her? She twisted her leg. Don't hurt her. Slowly. Yosra. Does this happen often? What's going on here? Yosra fainted. - Yosra fainted, boss. - Who is she? The new one. What's wrong with her? Maybe she didn't eat anything this morning. She's not used to this work, why did you bring her? Has she done this work before? - Hneya, do you have any sugar? Maybe she's low on sugar. It's okay, she's coming around. Give her a fig. Her teeth are clenched shut, she can't eat. She didn't eat anything this morning. Yosra? What am I supposed to do if she dies here? Leave her, it's okay. Get back to work. Everybody back to work, let her breathe! Hurry up. Hurry, they'll see us. Keep an eye out. It's okay, I'm watching. You're going to get me into trouble. If I didn't love you, I wouldn't be doing this. What you're doing is a sin. And our miserable pay, that's not? God will punish him. Come on! Give me your hand. Careful. Where should we sit? Shall we set up here? No, sit there. In the shade. - Sana, give me a crate. - No. - Come on, please. - I told you no. No, let go! - Fidé, what have you brought? - Lots of goodies! Good things, but mostly pasta. Whose is this? - I'll take some anyway. - Leave it, it's not ours. That's okay, I want some fresh bread too. - And what did you bring? - Pasta. Again! Chakchouka. It's still warm. - Who wants some? In the name of God. Come on. She says 'one bite' and then finishes the dish! Let me have another bite. Give me that, let's eat together. Firas! Be quiet! Firas, come! I brought you your meal. I can't right now. - There's not enough room. - Come on. Please. She made him a packed lunch, just for him. Certainly not for you. - Why didn't you bring that out before? - It was for him. Make him eat too! Finish it. You can get us to eat too. Eat, don't be jealous. Eat your food. Without being jealous. I should have told Ghaith to do it. - Have some eggs, Hneya. - No, I don't like that. Thank you, my Firas. Abdou, which is better, here or Monastir? To be honest, I'd say over there. The people, the atmosphere, the sea... Are there many tourists? Yes, but not as many as before. But here the people are better. How? They spend all their time minding each other's business... Is there any work out there? Yes. More than here? Here it's more about farming. I'm tired of farming. Abdou, what work do you do there? I just left school. I took a course. Did you leave school to do the course? Yes, I did two. What kind of things? The first course was in aluminum. Then pastries. So you make cakes and stuff? Yes. Are you ready for the new school year? - I don't think I'm going back. - Why not? I'm tired. You want to get married instead. - Finish school, it's better. - That's my decision to make. You have to pursue what you love. I love sleeping. Did you see the Instagram post yesterday? Check it out. - Can I see? - She's a bombshell. Not at all. Why are you showing that around? I do what I want. She's beautiful, isn't she? Show me. No. Everybody has seen it but me. I'm going to delete it. Give me the phone. - Why do you need to see it? - Everyone has seen it. Forget about it. Let go of the phone! You're hiding it from me... You don't want me to see it?! And you zoom in too! Come on, stop. I can't believe you're still looking. Now with Instagram, Facebook, Whatsapp... Keep your eyes open, and don't choose the wrong partner. Think carefully before you choose. There's nothing wrong with her showing herself. People are free. You could also show yourself wearing a niqab or hijab. It's inappropriate. She can do whatever she wants! At home he wants her naked, but outside in a niqab! Yes, maybe. Are you thinking of dressing like that for him? Never! But I guess anything is possible. You watch what you say! Only fate can tell. Zap! We were watching Bollywood TV as a family. Anyway, there was a scene that was... awkward. We all jumped for the remote to change the channel. I turned to my father and I swear he was glued to the screen. My poor husband. He has a fever, doesn't speak anymore. My knee is blue and swollen. You'll forget as you get older. You're here to work. You should have just stayed home. Come on, we don't have time. The boss will be looking for us. Hurry up. Time's up. We'll discuss it later. We'll do all of that. Listen, I'll call you back. Hey boss... are you good? Are you being a smooth talker? I have to be. That's all we do. So, who is it? A girl. - A girl? - Yes. If you're talking to a girl just tell me! Why are you hiding? You look nervous. Is she in love? I didn't want you to think that I wasn't working. - Is it a done deal? - Yes, all good. I can't stand it here. I'm suffocating here. From what? I don't understand. From everyone. There's nothing going on here. Stuck at home... nothing to do. I can't go anywhere. I can't even see my girlfriend! Does she not want to see you or is it you? No, we have nowhere to meet! You're not a kid anymore! Work all day, get drunk at night... She doesn't let you touch her. Why not? She's afraid of her mother, her father, her brother... her sister. Even kissing is off limits? She makes you fight just to get a little peck. That's not even the half of it. You have to be a real fox. Enough with this "Hi, I want to see you," business. But you can't do anything else here! Take her to the mountains! The main thing is that you see her. Make it work. In the mountains? You think there's nobody there? So we're going to meet under a fig tree or an olive tree?! In any case, people are closed-minded here. As soon as you talk to a girl, she thinks she's... She gets all pretentious. It's true, people here are wild. And they're all veiled. You take one look at them and they act offended. They think they're hot stuff, too. But you know all that. Over there, I get back from the market exhausted, and they're insisting to see me. They're in heat. You must have heard about these girls... Yeah... It hurts my heart. I take them out to the beach, or a house, or a hotel. They even drink alcohol. All of that is normal for them. In Nabeul. I know it's normal. You're so lucky. One day, I'll take you with me. To see what happens out there. My treat. God will return the favour. God will return the favour. Seriously, you'll have them all. You deserve a thousand girls. I can't leave you like this. Come on, get back to work. Thanks, boss. Meriem! - Where are the goods? - Leila, I'm going as fast as I can! Move over so I can get down. - Why are you coming down? - No more figs here. Let's rest for a couple of minutes. You'll be happy to get rid of us. We're going back to school. We'll miss you. What exactly will you miss? Which one of us will you miss? All of you. I'll call you, but you have to pick up. No, I'll block you. No respect. Fidé! Yes. - Where are the figs? - Over there! Bring them, we're running out of time. I don't have enough. - Two minutes. You've called her. If she doesn't come, let them figure it out. - I was going to take them. - I'm waiting for you. The boss said to not stack them. Don't make me wait any longer. I have to sort them. Wait, she's going to add a bit more. I told you to stop stacking them and to fill them less. Don't crush them. If I had put less, you wouldn't have been happy either. I'm waiting over there, but nobody is coming. Sana. What's going on? You seem angry. Don't act like you don't know. You've got to be kidding me. You were fine this morning, and now you're sulking. You should be able to figure it out by yourself. Don't patronise me, and stop playing games with me. What do you want? Stay away from Firas. Are you serious? See? Do you have to talk to him like that? Perched on the tree, blabbing away all flirty. Stop imagining things! I know you, turning the tiniest thing into... I see what you're doing. - What are you talking about? - How you act with him. Do you think I'm hitting on him? If he told you I was hitting on him, tell me! You should have just gone out with him! If I really wanted him, I wouldn't have let you have him. He will leave you like the others. - Excuse me?! What do you want now? You've screamed, you threw your bucket... What next? You know what you're like, with all your dramas and scandals! What are you talking about? What dramas? What scandals? If you know something I don't, say it! And what are you going to do to me? I'm not clingy like you. I'm just nice and sociable, that's it. You're just a tease! And everyone makes fun of you. It's useless talking to you. You've got issues. I'm glad I have issues. Great, be like that. A real sicko. That's right, a nervous wreck, just like you. I swear, you're crazy. All right, Fidé, shut up! Everyone's watching you. I don't care what other people think. That's their problem! This is crazy. Now you've pushed me too far. That's your problem. All of you, mind your own business! Go educate your daughters. If you're looking to get married, go ahead and look elsewhere. We'll see what kind of daughters-in-law you find! Big deal! They will all end up ordering you around. You only act like men here. With the city girls, you act like sissies. And you women, you've never flirted? Bullshit! There is not a single woman, not a single girl who has never been touched or done anything. Now they're pretending to be virgin saints. Never been touched by a man?! They're lying to each other. Think whatever you want, I don't care. Everyone should mind their own business. - Are you done now? - Leave me alone! If you have a problem, go see Firas, so he'll never talk to me again. Start by respecting yourself. Are you really this stupid? I regret speaking to you. She's got problems, I swear. Get back to work and stop yelling. What's the point of all this bickering? I prefer you when you're calm and composed. I'm neither calm nor composed. Leave me alone, please. That's out of character. Why? Please stay out of it. Why shouldn't I get involved? Tell me, what do you want me to say? You shouldn't behave like that. It doesn't suit you, my child. It's inappropriate. Why do you insult men? Calling them sissies... You fight well, for these sissies you're talking about. It's her. I don't care about men! I really don't care! Don't say that about us. There are still men, real men. Don't say there are no more real men. Who drove out the French? Women contributed too. Both fought for freedom. Together! Don't say women didn't help. It's better when you talk sensibly. I was really annoyed earlier. But what you said hurt me. It hurt me a lot. It's nothing... Those words just came out. May God bring you peace. May He bring everyone peace. - Here, take this. - No, thank you. You better not let him catch you eating it. We eat only what he offers us. We don't help ourselves. Let's forget about the boss. You. I'm 100% sure that you've liked someone else. I'm sure... Don't say otherwise. That's normal, I'm not the only one. You didn't meet anybody? Even if I had boyfriends, or if I was talking to other guys, it was just to clear my head. What do you mean by that? To forget you. After you, I never loved again. Okay, but... We were young, we didn't know anything. Maybe you think we were young and didn't know anything. But I don't. I don't know why... I can't get over you. Still? Still. There are a lot of things that make me think of you. Like what? Do you remember this? When we had an argument... Here. We'd had an argument and I cut myself with a compass. To tattoo your initials. It's starting to disappear. You can barely see it. But it's still there. At least you held onto a piece of me. Let me. We were happy then. Melek. Come on, come on. What does he want? I'm on my way. Don't forget your stick. I don't know how to get down. I'll help you. It's going to tip over! No, I'm not mad anymore. I thought you were still angry. Who do you think I did that for? I want to be with you, but I don't get into fights. I didn't get into a fight. A scene. - It wasn't a scene. - What was it then? A shame. You shouldn't be insulting each other. Did you hear what she said to me? Now that I'm jealous, you're no longer interested? You shouldn't have done that. I like it when we laugh and joke around... I don't like these fits of jealousy. You're always watching me. I don't like that. And you're hiding things from me too. You talked about things, secrets... - What things? - The things she mentioned. Our relationship has to be built on trust. Don't start doubting me. If there's nothing there, then what was she talking about? Nothing. I'm not hiding anything. I've been in a relationship... And it's over. I was in a relationship with someone that I never saw in real life. You're lying to me. Hi. What are you doing here? I was worried. Out of all the girls, you're worried about me? Yeah, so what? Come here for a second. Just a second! Don't be scared. - Let go. - Don't be scared. Let go of me. Let go of me. When I say stop, you stop. - Be quiet when I'm talking to you. - I have to work! I tell you when you have to work. I can do whatever I want with you. What are you doing? Get your hands off me, they'll see us. - Let's talk for a second. - Talk about what? - I have something to tell you. - Talk where? Go where? Let go of me! Why are you yelling? Don't yell at me. Wait a minute. - No! Get your hands off me. Let go of me. I'm letting go of you. Go straight on, you'll find him over there. Hello, Abdou. Welcome! You don't come to see your uncle? You'd rather send a bailiff after me? Why are you doing this? It's been five, six years since I last saw you... You should have come to see me! Why didn't you come to see me? - Why would I come? - To see your nephews. - Think I've got nothing else going on? - Same for me. - But you send a bailiff after me! - I tried to call you. A bailiff, like I've stolen something? Not stolen, snatched! - What? - You dispossessed us! You have nothing here! Then why did the bailiff come? You are nobody here! If you're right about that, you'll get your way. All right. You don't even come to check on us. Why are you here? To work the land? If you have a right to the land, then so does your brother. - He has no rights to it. - Why not? You have nothing here. - Period. - Okay. I take care of it, water it, harvest it and... - Many thanks to you. - ...you talk to me about rights! But even without being worked, even without you, land... No, no. ...land is land. You think you'll get it ready for use? All ready? You think it's for me? It's for my brothers and my children, one day. You've done nothing for this land. You're nothing to me. Whose name is this land in? My grandfather's. If you're entitled to it, so are we. That's the law. It doesn't matter who works the land. I'll never give up my kids' inheritance. I'd rather die! You have nothing here. - Meriem. - Yes? Have you seen Melek? Melek. Melek. Easy. Melek? I'm talking to you! What's wrong with you? Tell me what's wrong. Nothing. What's wrong with you? You look pale. You don't answer when I call. I looked for you with all the girls. Listen. I'm not okay right now. My family... I don't know where I stand anymore. I can't promise you anything. I don't want to confuse you. Are you leaving? Hneya, hurry up. Come on, hurry. Don't start wasting time. Hneya, is the tea ready? As soon as it's ready, I'll serve you some. - They're not going to pay you. - It's not ready. It's still just water! I'm not paying today. I'll give you credit. No, I'm not going to pay at all. You're not going to give us anything? Then you won't have tea. - Oh yes, you will give it to me. - I swear I won't! No drink for you! I'm not giving you free tea. Taste it and tell me. There's no sugar! There's none at all. - I put some in. - No, there's none. I swear I did. It's not sweet. Do you want to kill us? Sana, what's up with you today? Sana! You look like someone died. What's wrong with you? Just some stuff I'm dealing with. What a sigh, Leila. Leila, why is love so hard? Why is it so complicated? Have you ever been in love? - I am still in love. You have a knot in your heart. I have known love, I have lived it. Love has hardened me. - Is that why you're so tough? - Yes, I have suffered a lot. There's nothing funny about it, I still cry over it. After him... - Did you love someone close to you? - Yes, a neighbour. But you got married and that was over... I didn't know the man I married. - You didn't marry the man you loved? - No, not the one I loved. Your heart still longs for him. If he dies, I want to be buried with him. His wife probably won't want that. Is it going to be a three-floor grave? If I die before him, let him be buried on top of me. That's an idea. You think love is funny? No, just the crowd that you'll have in your grave. So what? This is fate. I will never forget my husband. What we experienced together is enough for me. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Here you go, Meriem. - Thank you. It's still warm. God, avenge me. My God, forgive me. Go on, go on. God, give me strength. - Are you done? - Yes. Sana! Where is Sana? It takes you an hour to get here. - From what? - What "from what"? - Here. - What's this? Your pay. What's this? Forty dinars for a week's work? - I'm not here to beg for money. - Are you blind? There's sixty. There's a whole day missing. - Which day? - I worked seven days. Seven days? When did you do an extra day? Oh yes, that's right, you came on Sunday. Wait, I'm writing this down. You never forget anything. - No, I don't. - A real vulture. You better be straight with me. - Here you go. - Thank you. Are we good? - Vulture. - You're the vulture. Ghaith! Go get your pay. You're used to getting yelled at anyway. I'm going. - Where are you going on holiday? - Holiday?! To the beach... Here you go. Thank you very much. I won't be coming next week. I have to rest, my leg is hurting. - Really? - I swear to you. How am I going to get by without you... If my knee feels better, I'll come. That's okay. Go ahead, I'll be right there, we'll go home. Come on, let's get going! Boss. - Hi. - Hi. Can you pay me already for today? - No, I can't. - Why not? Because I pay everyone by the week. I know, they told me. But I'm really in a pinch. Did you come to work or to settle a score? Explain. When I need to work, I work. This has nothing to do with my uncle. How so? I'm renting this land from your uncle. I could have problems with him. I don't want any shenanigans. No, don't worry. If you have a problem with your uncle, you can fight it out elsewhere, but not here. Okay. Leila, where are you? Here you go, Leila. Thank you very much. How much is it? - One week. - A week? Sixty dinars is not enough. It's your usual weekly pay. I've worked a lot with your dad... and your family... Thanks but... It's not enough. I've got some troubles, a lawsuit and a lawyer to pay. - What do you want? - Boss... I would like sixty dinars more, for the extra work. Really? I've always given you the same pay. You could help me out. I tell you everything about the workers. Everything they do. - It's okay, I know. - I break my back for you. I work hard for a little pay. - I know that you're a serious worker. - Thank you. I'll give you fifty dinars. But this stays between us. But I'm counting on you. - Of course. - Here's fifty. Thank you, may God help you. You too. - Is everything okay? - Yes. I've added twenty dinars. I don't want your twenty dinars. Too bad for you. I won't be coming back anymore. After putting on such a show, you want to leave?! What show? Dragging your feet from one tree to another. I work. Of course, I work too. We're all working... Fidé. Fidé! Why are you making that face? - I'm fine. - What's up? - Everything's fine. Here you go. I'd like to talk. What's up? I shouldn't have to explain anything to you, you know very well what you did. - What's the matter? - Don't you dare talk to me anymore. You are nothing to me. You're a nobody. Do you think you're something special to me? You thought I would marry you. You're talking like you're not just some girl. I'm warning you. If you keep bothering me or my sister Melek, this whole orchard will burn. Don't think that the people around here will let you get away with this. I swear you won't get off lightly. - Now you're threatening me?! I'm warning you. Think carefully! You're a real peasant. If you had any respect, you wouldn't talk like that. Hi, boss. Yes? Is today payday? Good question... But who is paying who? You're going to pay me. What am I going to pay you? You're not a real man. Never say that again! Not even as a joke. - And you're a thief too! - What did I steal from you? Figs! Who told you that? You didn't do anything? You didn't take anything? Get whoever told you that over here and we'll see. You take anyone's word. They get in your head. You have no shame... But boss, that's nonsense! I didn't expect this from you... I know for a fact it was you. I thought you were a good person. But now that I know... - What? It's not my fault that you'll take anyone's word over mine. - So what do you want now? - I want you to pay me! I'm not paying you anything! Get out of here. I will when you pay me. Otherwise you're not going anywhere! - Are you threatening me? - Yes, I'm threatening you. You think I work all week for you to pull something like this? You pay me right now! Don't start yelling, you're not getting anything! You're not getting paid, get lost! - I'm not paying you! Get out of my way! - No, I'm not leaving. - Yes, you will! - Pay me, God damn it! Don't insult God! Get out of here! Listen to me carefully. I'll believe what I want, I'm not paying you. Get out of here! Don't push me! I'm telling you to beat it! Go home! Do you hear? - Give me my money! - Go home! Do you hear? Do you understand or not? - Boss, pay me and I'm gone. - I'm not paying you! Don't touch me! Stop it, that's enough! I'll set fire to your car if you don't pay me! For God's sake, stop! What's all this, boss? I swear you'll get nothing! Go home, let me talk to him. You won't do anything. You're just a little shit! Don't drive me crazy! Do your job! Give up. Forget him. You deserve better. Make stacks of five or six, so it'll be easier for me. Pass me the rope. Come on, get in, Abdou. Hurry up. No, I'm not going that way. I'm going the other way. - It's on my way. - May God be with you. - Are you all good? - Yes. Go on, get in. Hurry up! God help us. My God... Move your foot. Leave it, I'll do it. Get your leg off of that. Put yourself higher up. Subtitles SUB-TI London
