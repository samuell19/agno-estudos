Summer, 1977 Aohigahara, foot of Mt, fuji Hey What happened? What's wrong? Hang on. Come here! Hey! Come here! Here you are, and have a nice flight. Thank you. Ah, wait, here. Thank you vey much. The strange cold wave that has struck Hokkaido this week continues unabated, causing snow storms in the middle of summer. And in Yamanashi prefecture, a stone egg was discovered in the Sea of Trees area near Lake Sai. Did he say a stone egg? I think so. ...Miss Hiroko Takami was taken to a nearby hospital where she kept screaming hysterically about a large stone egg and an ice wall. She is currently in a coma. The stone egg has not yet been fully examined by scientists. Ah, Ashizawa, where the hell are you going? Your plane is be leaving soon! The discovery of this petrified egg adds another mystery to the list of strange phenomena that have been happening recently throughout the world. Operation in progress Is anyone here from Miss Takami's family? Oh, nobody's come yet. Telephone call? I'll take it. Eh? Two big eyes? And they were moving... inside of the egg? Yes. Who are you anyway? I'm a reporter for the Yamanashi Daily. Hello? Hello? Ashizawa... Hurry up, it's time to go! You'll be late. Take this and cancel it. What? Ashizawa, you were supposed to go to Mexico. I thought you'd be halfway there by now. You were the one who insisted on going to Mexico to study those old sedimentary rocks. I know, but now I've found something more interesting. That petrified egg? You're not being vey practical. My father found one before he died and in the same area around Mt. Fuji. I know your father was a famous paleontologist. But you shouId remember that you're a geologist. And that girl they found... she's out of her mind. That's why I've got to see for myself. You won't change your mind then. You've been a very good worker, but the other employees... That's it, then? Boss... If that stone should turn out to be a reaI dinosaur egg, what then? What? A dinosaur? Right. LEGEND OF DINOSAURS AND MONSTER BIRDS Hey, keep that up and nobody'll come to the Dragon festival. Want us to help you? You can't expect us to help you for free, though. Part time... student workers! With young ideas... And excellent results. Well? We don't need your kind of heIp. Aw, don't say that! Hey! Where's the Fuji Wind-Hole? I saw it on television yesterday. You want to go there? - Yes. Oh, don't worry, it's part of my job. It's a wild place. You'd better be careful. There's been a lot of strange things happening up there this summer. A lot of horses and cows have run off and disappeared. And there's been a lot of long worms coming out all over the place. What are the long worms? - Snakes! Ah, come on . . . get off, get off... Say, want to come with me? I'm going to look for that petrified egg. You gotta be kidding! We could use the money, but there isn't enough money in the world to get me to go up there. Today's hero... seeking adventure! So you finally woke up. You almost killed yourself this time. That place is too dangerous to wander around alone. This place... what is it? You don't remember? This used to be your father's cabin. But now, I'm using it for a while. And who are you? Sho-ohei Muku. Oh! Now I remember... I see. Takashi, why did you come up here? Trying to follow in your father' s footsteps? Well, no. Hey. Tell me. I'm looking for that petrified egg. Petrified egg? Oh! The one that the girl saw.. . She probably fell into one of those ice caves and went into shock. That happens to those city people sometimes. But this egg your father found was the real thing, alright. Remember this? Yes. Find a lot of them and you wouldn't have to worry about money for the rest of your life. So, you're here for money. You know, I believe that I know more about Mount Fuji than anyone else. And I used to argue with your father all the time. I said that this petrified stone was really a snake's egg... But your father said it was a dinosaur's. He was a stubborn man. It must have been my father who brought us together again. Tomorrow, will you act as my guide in the Sea of Trees? Sorry, but I can't do that. If you're just doing it for the money I won't help. Here. There are a lot of dead fish in the water. I wonder what happened to them? Where? Maybe the water temperature is too warm for them. Poor things. Yo! Where is this? An Australian Beach carnival and there's a niche up above it. Oh? I guess you came here to look for stones so you can make more money. There's nothing around Lake Sai. Since Lake Leman ... it's been a year. It's been a long time. Take them away! Take them away! Hurry Get rid of them... Quick! Throw them out! Let's go farther out. Help! Stand back, stand back! Bring a stretcher! Quick! It's horrible! There was an accident! Accident? What kind of accident? Hey, I bet they saw something terrible. Maybe the dragon. I bet it was Nessie, the monster. Every lake is supposed to have a monster in it. It sure is strange... How could that boat they were riding capsize on a calm lake like this? Fuji Meteorological Science Laboratory -A monster? Another fairy tale about a monster? Professor.. . Is that your answer? Well now, there's no concrete evidence that something like that really exists, is there? And can you accurately predict earthquakes? Ashizawa. Yes? What do you think of the recent earthquakes and the abnormal weather? It's just nature's way of retaliating against a stupid human race, isn't it? Predicting earthquakes would cause panic. Do you think you could survive that just by having a lot of money? Yes, I'd find a hiding place. Like the dinosaur your father kept searching for, after a few thousand years of hibernation you'd suddenly come to life again? I would if I could! The reason your father's theory about living dinosaurs wasn't accepted was out of fear that it would throw the world into total chaos. Ashizawa. Benjamin Franklin, who discovered electricity, found a toad one day that had been hibernating for several million years and brought it back to life again. Oh? So finding a dinosaur is within the realm of possibility. But keep this in mind... If a dinosaur does appear, we'll also have magnitude five earthquakes. The money you can make is in proportion to the danger, isn 't that right? Ashizawa... And that's a bad thing? Was that alright? Yes, that was perfect. That's a very old lullaby that mentions the Red Chinese Lantern Plant. The people in this area told their babies to stop cying or they'd put them in the Lake and the Dragon with red eyes like the Chinese Lantern Plant would come and eat them up. The ancient people were very superstitious about dragons. It's a quaint folk song . Kuma, Kuma! Kuma! Kuma! Kuma! Kuma! Kuma! what's wrong? Drink this. Poor girl. A horse without a head! A horrible practical joke! Maybe it wasn't a joke. What's that? You two had better go back to Tokyo. Why's that? Because things like this keep on happening? But I still have to film the Dragon Festival tomorrow. How is your work coming along - hunting for that petrified egg? It's alright. Hey! Don't scare us like that. We just came back. There isn't a dead horse anywhere in that area. We looked all over the place and couldn't find a thing. Don't be stupid! There was a pool of blood and the body of the horse was in it. There was something that could have been blood stains. Probably from a dog or something that was hit by a car or a truck. Look, we're busy getting ready for the festival. Please don't give us any more trouble. Let's go. - Stay out of trouble. That's weird. You both actually saw it. Junko, here. You think somebody moved it? What's that!? It's not a tire track. I'm sure you'd all like to know the history of Mount Fuji. Can you imagine that this whole area was completely underwater just 30 million years go? And then slowly, a little here and a little there, it came up out of the water. And that's how Mount Fuji got to be a skyscraper mountain! Since its formation it has always been a scenic wonder. 3776 meters above sea level... It's the tallest mountain in the whole country. The shape of this beautiful mountain is well known around the world. There are five lakes around Mt. Fuji: Yamanaka, Kawaguchi, Sai, Shoji and Motosu... Among all of these lakes the one with the most mysterious atmosphere is Lake Sai... home of the Red-Eyed Dragon. This is Lake Sai and I am Akira Moroguchi. Today, we've brought you a fantastic present. You won't beIieve it until you hear it from the boys in the band. Now everybody, LET'S GO! Excuse me, young lady. Is it true that there's a monster in this lake? Well... What'd you say?... Don't you know what I mean? Monster, Monster! It's just a matter of time before it'll come out! That young couple... they haven't been found yet and the earth's crust is moving. Then there's the body of that headless horse, so I think it's obvious. Hey, hey, don't start that dinosaur thing. Hah, I like the idea that it's just a big snake. Think about it... a big snake eating up all those cows and horses. - Hey... Take a look at this. Here's where we found the headless horse. It looks like the marks left by a tractor. Hmm... If it was a snake, it wouldn't be straight. It'd zigag and weave. Ah, here... If it was the tail of a Plesiosaurus, it would leave a mark like this. But that's if it was still alive. My father toId me many years ago, that human beings are animals... Animals that have forgotten that they are animals... Human beings really don't know as much as they think they do. And I still believe him. Develop good perception and keep powers of observation... Because nature has many mysteries... What?! Are you alright? Akira! Eveyone, calm down! Calm down! Please calm down! Out there! What happened? Hey! Hey, Hey! Look out there! Something strange is swimming! Hey! Eveyone, look out there! Hey! Out there, over there! What is that? It Iooks like a giant fin! A big fish? It must be a big shark! A shark? A shark! A shark! It's a big shark! It's a monster! It's a monster! Monster!? What? Is that the monster? It's a dinosaur. A dinosaur! Hey, it's coming this way! Get out of here! Hurry up, come on! Get out of here. It's a dinosaur! Hey, this is no time to be playing around with your camera. Hey, wait, wait, hey! Ah! It's only a fake. Look! Let me see! Who would do a stupid thing like that? It's a phony! Gee, that's right. It's just a fake! Fake? Is that true, hey? It's just an imitation. It's just a phony monster. Hey, it's a phony monster! It's just an imitation. When the weather gets bad, some people go mad, right? So, let's have fun ! Thank you vey much. Thank you. Were you here too? Did you see all that fuss? What happened to the stage? I don't know. Do you know? No It's really strange. Good, good. Let's get out of the water. Right. Man, I'm tired. That wasn't easy. It looks like it didn't work at all. Is that the big experience of our trip? Jiro! Hey! How was it? Ah! Shit. Let's go. Hey. Hurry up and get out of there! Alright! Hiroshi! Hiroshi! Hiroshi! Hiroshi! Hey, Hiroshi! Sea of Trees... Ashiwada Town Hall The Monster, Mons... The Monster's here! Alright, we've had it with your practical jokes. It's not a joke anymore! I really saw that thing! Susumu and Hiroshi were... Agh . . . He sounds crazy. Now, listen. If you want to do this, you should really try to do a better job. That didn't help us at all. Another joke? Look at me! Do I look like I'm lying to you!? There's really a monster out there! The festival is all over now. It had a really long neck. Excuse me. All wet and slimy. About 20 meters long. The head was about here. Where's the mayor? Where's the mayor? Get the mayor! What's all this noise? What? Who's there? Mother! Is that you? That's strange... Left, left, right, left . . . Ahh! When I was still a young girl, there were many times when children playing near the shore would disappear, People said they were taken away by the Dragon that lived in the lake, Junko. But what was this dragon really supposed to be? Well, thousands of years ago, when Mount Fuji erupted,,, Junko! Junko... Ohh... Don't scare me like that! Get in the boat Come on! Look out! You're in our way. Get away! You don't have to shout. I can hear you . Do you realize what I've found here? Not just a bunch of petrified bones, but a real dinosaur that's living in the lake. I read all about what's happening there in the paper. Come back now. There's been an earthquake down in Mexico. So come back now! Didn 't you hear what I said? Like they did with Nessie.. . How about your company offering a prize to whoever finds the monster? What's that? Put up prize money? Alright. Stay there forever and dig your grave at Lake Sai. Listen. This isn't just another wild tale about a monster. I think there's a live Plesiosaurus here. A Plesiosaur... Off Limits by order of the Yamanashi Police Department You people in the boat, this area has been declared off limits. Hey, it's off limits here, go back home. Go back. Is that true? I came all the way from Kyoto on the bullet train to find out. Please, come again some other time. This is being brought to you from the shores of Lake Sai, The lake is 903 meters above sea level with 12 kiIometers of shoreline. It covers an area of 2 square kilometers and has a depth of more than 90 meters. It is surrounded by 12 mountain passes, maple-covered hills, Lahe Sai is a mysterious place, and today, the most advanced scientific equipment and the leading scientists of the county are gathered to start their investigation... JA 75025. This is Foxtrot One. Report your present position. Go ahead. Is there really a creature living in those depths? Soon we should have solved the mystery of the lake... Attention everyone, the lake is now off limits. Please do not go near the water. Yes, that's right. And besides that, this piece of equipment is the latest full-range scanning sonar. Previous models of this sonar could only see in one direction. But with this new model we have complete 360-degree coverage. Will it even pick up small fish? Yes, I'll show you. That's very interesting. Oh, I see what you mean. Large echoes and small echoes are all indicated. What about at night? Yes, there's no change. Do you really believe there is a dinosaur living somewhere in this lake? I could never believe a thing like that. When I visited you last time, I wasn't sure. Now.. I believe that there's a live Plesiosaur somewhere in this lake. You're being a little premature predicting that without any evidence. A poor attitude for a scientist. I'm positive that it exists. My father was also positive about it based on scientific data. Of course, he never saw one. So, I'm determined to see this Plesiosaurus with my own eyes. You're getting more like your father everyday. This is Foxtrot Three. There's been a change in plan. Continue flying. Number 1 camera, stay as you are. Number 3 camera... Number 3 camera... Mr. Kobayashi's here. Thank you all for coming. Thank you vey much. Over this way, please. Please. This way, please. Plesiosaurus? You mean... it's a dinosaur? It is probably one of the most well-known reptiles from prehistoric times. The name Plesiosaurus means 'close to reptile'. It's an aquatic reptile that existed during the Mesozoic Era. The Plesiosaurus became extinct 70 million years ago. It's petrified bones... Mr. Harold, I didn't mean that... Well, professor. There was one scientist who believed in the existence of dinosaurs in the Fuji Five Lakes area. And he was the father of Mr. Ashizawa here. A famous biologist, Bunkichi Ashizawa. I am familiar with his theory. But the academy... Unfortunately, his theory wasn't accepted. Ashizawa. My father firmly believed a hibernating dinosaur existed around one of these lakes. And when naturaI conditions were just right, it would come to life again. That was his basic theory. The air temperature, the movement of the earth... Nature has many mysteries. The environment we live in... Some things become petrified and other things go into hibernation for millions ofyears. These natural conditions that you mentioned... All of the conditions are right. And what does that mean? Mount Fuji's eruption. What!? An eruption? That means there'll be a big earthquake. Left face! Forward- on the double! Mayor! Mayor! What is it? It's pretty good, isn't it? Mayor, hurry now. It's over there. Oh, you're taking so much trouble. Oh, no, no, no, no. From early morning, the search goes on using every available type of scientific equipment, And still, not a single thing has been found, If this continues, the mysterious monster of the lake will go on sleeping in the deep blue water, perhaps forever, as it has for centuries, and remain a mystey. Mayor, have they called off the search? Yes. You're going to just let that monster run around free in the lake? Top level experts searched for it with the most advanced equipment for three days. But they didn't find anything. It's only natural for them to stop searching. Mayor! How many people have been killed so far? Six people! How can you catch something you can't even find? We just don't have the money. The lunches alone would bankrupt the village. Mayor! Mayor! The next victim could be your own daughter! Mind if I come along? It's alright. We'll fix it right away. Ah , hello. Take a look at this. It could be in the lake or maybe some other place... Well now, here we are... Look at this. What the hell is that? A rhamphorhynchus. Rham... phorynchus? Rhamphorhynchus. If there was a dinosaur, a Rhamphorhynchus couId be alive too. I'm leaving. Aren't you a diver? You're a diver, aren't you? Then why don't you go and dive? Why don't you dive? Every one of us has a famiIy. It's too dangerous to dive here. Cowards! You're cowards! Damned fool! How can you find something that's not there? Huh? Come on , you can't talk to this stupid drunk. Let's go. But I saw it... It's there! It's living in the water of this lake. It's there! What're you doing? Stop it! Why... Why did you do that? I know you're a professional diver, and that you're an expert at underwater photography. I know how you feel about Junko's death. But you can't go in the water! I still don't understand. Why not? Because I'm a woman? I know. You want to monopolize the whole thing! You really are doing this for the money. Isn't that right? You're terrible! Akiko... I just want to see this thing. I want to see a real Plesiosaurus. Just like one animal meeting another animal. If I could see it, I would burn the image in my mind . Even if it means dying, I must do this. And if I don't come back, you can go. But you can't die! You shouldn't die! Professor, how big is this place anyway? You know, I sometimes get lost here myself. You don't have to scare me! Professor! Look! Oh, you found one. It's nothing unusual. People have come to this forest to commit suicide for years. Attention, everyone near the lake,,, Listen carefully, Attention please... In 20 minutes, depth charges will be dropped into the lake, No one will be allowed to enter the lake, I repeat, 20 minutes from now, depth charges will be dropped into the lake. Stay out of the water Careful, careful... Alright First boat, second boat...start! Number One, Number One. This is Number One, come in, Report when you reach your position. Roger, Number Two, Number Two. This is Number Two, Repor when you reach your position. - Roger Number One, release! Roger! This is Number Two, we're in position. Number Two, release! Roger! This is Number One, come in, please. Number One, release! Release! Roger! Mayor. Headquarters, this is Number Two. Everything is normal here, Everything is normal here, Headquarters, this is Number One, Come in, please... What happened? Even monkeys fall from trees, right? Next time I'll fly. You can't do that here. I can. Now jump, jump. But I really don't want to... Well, what do you know about this? Look! Huh? This is... Alright. Hey, it's getting really dark. Mayor, what's that? What is that? There's going to be an earthquake! I'm positive. Go and warn eveybody. An earthquake! Emergency call, count off! One! Two! Three! four! five! Six! What the hell is that? What? Chief! Chief, can you see that? Chief! Wait, hold it. Run, run! Hey! hey! A rifle! Bring me a rifle, quickly! Fire! Ah, I am so relieved. Akiko. Akiko, let's. All right. It's alive! Takashi! Hurry up! A Plesiosaurus... I thought so... You're still alive! Akiko... Hurry! Akiko! Don't move. Stay still now! It's erupting! Takashi! Give me your hand! Takashi! Takashi! Akiko! Hang on! Hang on! Takashi! Akiko! Takashi, Takashi! Takashi! Akiko! Takashi! Akiko! Takashi... Akiko! Akiko! THE END
