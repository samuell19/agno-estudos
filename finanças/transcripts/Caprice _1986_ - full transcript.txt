♪ When I walk up and down... ♪ Lucky! The light of my life! - Hello, Jacko, is it in? - Is it in? Is it in? They're all in! What? Caprice, Jacko! Out on Thursday, sometimes Wednesday night! You look a bit pale, my love. I'm all right, Jacko, I'm all right. - I just want to know if it's in! - Let me tell ya, I've heard there's some lovely little articles in there this week. There's a kaleidoscope of colours happening on the fashion page. The social page, gathering gossip. And Edwina La Page, the editor-in-chief, has lined up Billy Pez on the music page! Oh, don't tell me, Jacko! I want to see for myself! - You must be Lucky. - How do you know? You're our number one reader, it's our business to know. Why don't you come up and see us? Well, I'd love to! But how? Miss Herringbone? Are you there? Darling, I've been waiting for you. There's so much to get through. What are we going to do? You are going to sit, my dear. Caprice is going to do. Betty? Nola. Zizi. Meet my colour-sensitive girls. I just dream of looking like that! We'll soon sort that out. Don't daub, Jordan. Careful, Andrea. I don't believe it! I think I'm going to cry! Look, Lucky, look. Look at Lashene, lavish Lashene, for lashes that last. Oh, lovely. I'm sorry, I didn't bring any money with me. Oh! ♪ Chestelle... ♪ It's nothing, absolutely nothing. Chestelle is a secret that nobody knows but you. I'm sure. Why worry? It's just between you and me. Yes, but I don't want it, Chestelle, leave me alone! Oh! I'm really sorry, I didn't mean to... My lamb. My gazelle. How ruffled you seem. Tell me. Tell me what's wrong. Well, this tunnel isn't at all what I expected. Don't be upset. Now you're with me... You can relax... and be the beautiful confident woman I know you are. Oh, my goodness! Who are you? My name is Douglas. Douglas Furbanks. And my privilege is to warm... an exceptional woman. Warm her? I'm not cold. Ah, Lucky... my leopardess... ...all strong women feel the cold. With a fur... ...you could be the confident, beautiful woman... ...that I know you are. And at a very reasonable price from any reputable stockist. Ooh! You're like all the rest of them. Relax... and be the beautiful, confident woman you are. Emilio. My name is Emilio. Every woman deserves me. Stroke me and your wishes will come true. What, really?! Magic? Oh, brilliant, I'm starving. Now Emilio is aroused. Emilio knows your darkest secrets. Take me. Buy me. Oh, I haven't got any money. Emilio has the magic only money can buy. Open your purse and let him cast a spell... on your cash. Well, I'm afraid I'm absolutely broke, Emilio. You'll have to conjure up someone with a big handbag and no sense of smell. Billy Pez!

Usual sort of thing. Read me next week. Bye-ee! Right! That's it. You must be Lucky. I've heard so much about you. Have you been enjoying yourself? Well, of course. I'm very grateful to be given this chance. We're all one big family here, you know? Well, that's what's so confusing, Edwina. I don't find this a very friendly place at all. I used to think Caprice was about how to be a full person, but no-one here seems very secure about anything. Well, I think that's a great pity if you feel that, my dear. Especially when I had such plans for you. Plans? I thought you might like to be our next... - cover girl. - Me?! Cover girl?! You look so marvellous after all you've picked up. What have I picked up? Good god, girl! I'm offering you the cover of Caprice. I don't believe what I'm hearing. Such arrogance. With Caprice, the world is your oyster. You can do what you like, go where you want. You'll meet everyone you've ever dreamed of. You'll have proper money for the first time in your life. After all, what is your life... without Caprice? I don't know. Not much, I suppose... but at least it's mine. Lucky. I didn't want you to give Caprice a bad name. Staff. Stop her! Stop her! Stop her! Lucky! Come back at once! Lucky! Lucky! Stop her! Stop her! Relax. Come closer. Relax and be the beautiful, confident woman I know you are. Lucky! Look, Lucky, look! Look at Lashene! Stop her! Stop her! Stop her! Stop her! Stop her! Stop her! Lucky. Luck... Luck... Luck... Lucky! You'll have to jump through, Lucky, it's quite thick paper. Lucky! Lucky! Do you hear me? Caprice - it's here! Oh, hello, Jacko. You seemed to have drifted off for a while there, my love. These glossies must be really getting to ya! Here... there's one on me. And don't say I never give you nothing! No, thank you, Jacko. I'd rather not. Dearie me! Do my listeners deceive me? Is this not the same lady that comes to visit me for the past I-dunno-how-long? Lucky, you must be under the weather. It's not for me, Jacko.
