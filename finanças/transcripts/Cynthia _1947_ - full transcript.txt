"Wyandotte College 1930." "Looking back over seventeen years .." "It seems strange that school was almost over before I met Larry Bishop." "But then I was only a freshman. And he was a junior." "And something of a campus hero too." "The year Larry hit the home run to win the 1930 championship for Wyandotte." "After the game there was a party at the crew house." "And I remember showing off at the piano." "Hoping that Larry would notice me." "Well, finally .. he noticed me." "Next thing I knew we were in the middle of the lake .." "Telling each other the stories of our lives." Gee, that music sounds nice from out here, doesn't it. Hmm. You know, you're awful good at the piano. I'll be better when I get back. Back? Where from? Vienna. - Vienna? After I finish college I will study at the Vienna Conservatory. No kidding? That's where I am headed. Vienna? - Sure. After I finish college and medical school. I'm going to take my postgraduate work with Dr Eiselsberg in Vienna. Maybe we'll meet. You got a date. What are you going to do this summer? Going to Michigan. A music concert at a kid's camp. Lucky kids. And you? Oh, I have to go back to Napoleon. Napoleon? - Napoleon, Illinois. My home town. - Oh. In the summer time I help out in old man Dingle's hardware store. But someday I'm going to have the finest clinic in the whole darned state. That's wonderful. It's going to be a long summer. Not for me. Not if I know you'll be here in the fall. I'll be here. "Well, it was a long summer." "September came at last." "And just before Thanksgiving we were married." Hey Lou, are you alright? I'm okay. - Honey. What happened? I hurt my wrist a little. - You were sailing along fine. Did you catch a ledge or something? Let's see it. Gosh, I'm sure glad no-one saw you take that spill. I've been going round bragging that my wife was the best skier in the college. What's the trouble, Lou? They say when you get scared you always fall. And Larry, I am awful scared. You are scared? What about? Lou. Oh Lou. Honey. Oh, gee. Well, you silly goon. Why did you come skiing? I was afraid to tell you, Larry. We've made so many plans. I just didn't want anything to happen to Vienna. Now what could a little baby do to a big city like Vienna? Then you don't mind? - Mind? Of course not, sweetheart. That's what marriage is all about. When is it going to be? - September. September? Gee, that's wonderful. That's when my sister Carrie has her baby. We'll go back to Napoleon and you can have them together. Then .. then all we need is a basket. That's it. Just a little basket. Then we can go back to campus or push off for Vienna. In the basket goes baby and away we go. - Sure. Come on, let's finish this run. - Nothing doing. No more skiing for you this winter. - People will want to know why. Then by golly we'll tell them why. Hey, everybody! We're married. We're going to have a baby and we're going to Vienna. "She was a lovely child, our Cynthia." "But frail and delicate." "And of course that meant doctor's bills." "Months and years of doctor's bills." "Somehow, there was never enough left over to go back to college." "To our medicine and music." "And by the time Cynthia was 15 years old." "The future had passed us by." "And whatever was in our hearts .." "We never even talked about." "Vienna." Cynthia, are you going to the game? No thanks. I have a date. We'll be seeing you. - Goodbye. Hello fellah. What's your name? Well .. that's a nice name. This is not my house, fellah. I'm afraid uncle Fred would not like you very much. Now stay there. That does it. McQuillan. All these shots I'm taking. Do you really think they're doing me any good. A nurse in this office is not supposed to think. It means coming here every afternoon. Come to see me in a few days, Frank. - Okay. Well, Cynthia. How are we feeling today, huh? - Fine thank you, uncle Fred. Uhuh. Your color seems better. Let's keep up the B Complex. - Yes, doctor. See you tonight, Cynthia. You'd better go straight home. It's getting chilly. I will as soon as I finish my singing lessons. Yes. Nothing like scales to strengthen the thoracic regions. Yes, uncle Fred. Scale, scale. Always scale. You should make music for pleasure. Yet we make scales for your health. Ah, but uncle Fred said that practising scales will .. Will strengthen my 'thoracic region'. The 'thoracic region'. And make you fat with three chins. I hate chins. Cynthia. I am going to tell you a story. Very, very interesting. Do you know how opera singers sometimes get jobs? How? By having friends with influence. I have seen it myself in all the famous opera houses of the world. Milan and everywhere. Why not Napoleon High School? Next week on Tuesday we have trials for .. The school operetta. Have you heard? Yes I know. Maybe a nice part could be arranged for you. Do you really think I could? - Why not? You are my good friend and I am the impresario of Napoleon High School. I would love to. But with all the rehearsing and practising and everything. It might be too strenuous. I wouldn't even ask uncle Fred. Maybe you can ask your mummy, Cynthia. She loves music. She understands. Before you were born. When you are a little baby she comes all the time in the studio. And tell her about the great festivals. Salzburg, Biarritz, Vienna. All of a sudden she .. She doesn't come anymore. But today we will learn a real piece of music. So here we are. You will learn this and surprise your mama. Long ago it was her favorite. When she hears you sing this. She will say positively 'yes'. What this will do for the thoracic region I will give no guarantee. But. For the heart. I know the pleasure. It was nice of you to tag along, fellah. You are wonderful company. But this is as far as I go. Run along now. Didn't you hear me? Go on. Scoot. Well. Wait. Wait right here. Mother. Mother. Mother. Hi. Darn this thing. I want to show you something. Don't ask me what. You have to see it. This has to work. It's supposed to. Mother, please come. - Alright, honey. But I warn you it had better be pretty special. He's the most .. most understanding .. Perhaps not the prettiest. Just wait until you see him. He is so cute. There he is. Look at him. Can't we keep him, mother? - Well, honey. I'm willing to take all the care of him. - I know you would but .. We would have to .. Cynthia, we just have to discuss it with daddy first. I'll call him at the store now. Isn't he cute? I do hope daddy lets me keep him. Hello? Dingle Hardware Store? May I speak to Mr Bishop please? I think you had better talk to him. Hello. Hello, Larry. I wouldn't have bothered you dear but a big, big problem has come up. We're faced with an addition to the family. No, no. I am talking about a dog. An awfully cute pup, Larry. I don't know. A local character of doubtful family. Anyway, he's glued himself to Cynthia. It's love at first sight and she wants to keep him. I know, but .. But Larry, he's short-haired and he looks healthy and .. If he bathed every day. I am sorry, fellah. I should have told you. Achoo. I'm allergic to dogs. But how can we know? We've never had one in the house. Now. By gosh, Lou. I don't think we ought to take the chance. I know Fred wouldn't like it. Alright. Alright, honey. I'll see you at Carrie's for dinner. Right. Goodbye. I'm sorry about the interruption, Gus. I say I'm sorry about the interruption. We have a little problem with the kid. - Oh. All kids are problems. As I was saying, Larry. I don't want to press you. But Thatcher wants an answer on that house of yours. Yes or no. Gosh, we haven't missed paying a month's rent on the house in 16 years. Thatcher can't just throw us out like that. Hmm. No law says he can't sell if he wants to. That's right. - The price ain't bad. Three thousand down though? Come again. Three thousand. Gus, why not get yourself a hearing instrument? I can hear. If people don't mutter. I said three thousand dollars down is a lot of money. Don't shout. Larry. The great fortunes of this country have all sprung from real estate. Anyway. Where will you find another house to rent nowadays? Yes. I guess that's right. - Larry. Yes, sir. Excuse me. The boss wants to see me. Yes, sir. I tell you all the great fortunes of this country. Have sprung from real estate. Did you want to see me, J.M? Hand me that bottle, Larry. - Yes, sir. Is it your back again, J.M? Yes. And this weather don't help it. I'm afraid I'll have to bake it out for a couple of months down in Florida. Do you think you get along around here without me? I don't see why not, J.M. I've managed it alone every year up to now. Yeah. Give me some water, will you. - Yes, sir. J.M. About that house of mine. I already advised you about that. A man who owns his own four walls is king. Buy it, my boy. Buy it. Yes, sir. I'd like to if I could swing it. But the problem is .. Well. If you remember last year you said that if sales kept up .. That maybe we could take about a raise. I figured out that ten dollars a week more would see me through fine. Larry. How long have you been with me? 16 years, J.M. That's not counting the summers I was here before, when I went to school. That's right. I took you on right smack in the middle of the depression. There you were, just married. Stone broke. And with a sick baby. That's right, J.M. I'm not going to give you what you asked, Larry. I am going to give you more. I am going to give you one hundred thousand dollars. Gosh, J.M. That's wonderful but .. But .. I don't get it. What's the income on $100,000 at three percent? That's three thousand dollars a year. That's what you're getting now. And that's what I am promising you as long as our doors stay open. You have security, Larry. You've got the income of a cool $100,000. That is awful nice of you, J.M. But .. About the house. You run over and see the boys at First National. Tell them that I said you're a hundred percent risk. Alright. Thank you, J.M. You mean you'll endorse my note? - No. You won't need me. Ask your brother-in-law Fred to sign it. Alright, sir. I'll get Fred. J.M. Do you mind if I hop over to the bank now to take care of it? Go ahead. Get it settled. A man who's got personal problems on his mind can't do a good day's work. That's right, sir. Larry. Tell Gus Wood that this is a hardware store and not a real estate office. Yes, sir. I will tell him. In the future. Transact your own personal business at home. Yes. Thank you, J.M. On Sundays. Yes, sir. I will do it on Sundays. Thanks for the ride, Gus. Okay, Larry. Hello, Fred. How is the boy? - Come in. I am sorry I am late. Dinner is usually at six, Larry. - Yes. I know. Fred. For heaven's sake why don't you let the maid open the door? Carrie, it's only your kid brother. Come on, give me a kiss. I'll take your things. - Thanks. Here. Are my girls here yet? They are in the parlor. - Ah. Hello Lou. Hello, dear. Sorry I'm late, honey. I had a very important business matter to take care of. How is my big girl? - Hello dad. How do you feel? - I feel fine really. Let me look at you. Are you sure? - Quite sure. Carrie, will we wait for that daughter of yours or are we going to eat now? The Bishops are ready. We can't eat until it's announced, dear. Honestly, Lou. The help you get nowadays is simply maddening. You don't know how lucky you are to be doing your own housework. Really, Carrie. I hadn't thought of it that way. Supper is on. 'Dinner', Agnes. Well, it's ready. Come along. Fred. You were so hungry. Come along. - Yes, yes. We should sit down before everything gets cold. You sit over there in your usual place, dear. That is the bell if you want me. We just have to start without Fredonia. That's all. She's at that stage. You know. Boys, boys, boys. Never in the house five minutes. You should thank your stars Lou, that's one problem you don't have with Cynthia. Boy, am I hungry. Fred says we eat too much. He says an ounce of diet is worth a pound of medicine. Are you kidding? You would be amazed at the strikes being made in the field of diet these days. By the way, Cynthia. We're keeping away from all fresh fruits, aren't we? Fresh fruits of any kind. Not much fruit in the market these days. Only apples, dear. Well then, let's stay away from apples. Especially apples. Yes, uncle Fred. By the way, Fred. How is old man Thatcher? A slight coronary condition. Heart trouble. I'll say he's got heart trouble. It's made of stone. He is selling our house. Larry. Yeah. Gus Woods broke the news to me today. The old codger has finally decided to sell. What are you going to do? Well. [ Car horn ] Bye. Is that you, Fredonia? Coming mother. Won't be a sec. I am .. I'm sorry I'm late. Only that darned jalopy of .. Of Will Parker's broke down and .. Then we got stuck in traffic. Then we had to drop some of the kids off. So .. so that's why I am late. Hello everybody. Darling. Don't you want to know who won the game? We did. 22-18. More excitement. Guess who's back in town. Ricky Latham. And he's a dream. I hear he's starting school again. - Fredonia, please. Your uncle Larry was trying to tell us something. Go on, Larry. Well, as a matter of fact Fred there isn't much else to tell. I asked Gus about another house to rent and he just laughed in my face. I suppose we'd better start moving our furniture right out onto the sidewalk. I am the one to blame. And no-one else. I should have insisted .. Instead of just advising you to buy that house years ago. What's so funny, Larry? Or is it funny to find yourself in a spot like that? Yeah. Only .. Only little Larry got himself off the spot. I bought the house. You bought it? Yes. That is, I made arrangements for the down payment. The boys at the bank okayed me for $3,000. They. They just want your signature on this note, Fred. Excuse me, Lou. Your old John Hancock on there is just a formality, but .. You know how those bankers are. Look here, Larry. I will have to think this over. What is there to think about? Well. A man doesn't just endorse another man's note 1-2-3. It's not good business. But. Fred, this isn't a business matter. This is more of a family thing. That's just the point. I have my own family to think about. Suppose .. suppose something happened? And I was stuck with that note. I was playing golf only last Sunday with Jerry Smith up at the club. On Monday morning. He was dead. Lou. What about that insurance money your father left you? What about it, Carrie? Carrie. That is Lou's money. Well. It seems to me people don't go begging a meal when they have food in the icebox. No, Carrie. They don't. - Aren't we overlooking one thing? I don't want to buy the house. But Lou. Please, Larry. Let's not discuss it now if you don't mind. Alright, sweetheart. Whatever you say. Now can I talk? - Of course, dear. Well, about the Ricky Latham deal. He ran away and joined the navy when he was only fifteen. He's been everywhere. The minute I saw him I realised what a bore Will Parker was. For Pete's sake, nobody is listening. I don't think uncle Fred was very nice. Well. I suppose we got to look at his side of it too. The way he talked to you. And aunt Carrie too. Oh. You know, kiddo. Relatives. But you don't talk to them that way. - Please, Cynthia. Mother. What would happen if we didn't go to uncle Fred's every Thursday night? We'd survive. Say, Lou. If you remind me tomorrow I'll be glad to fix that ringer for you. You know, the new washing machines should be coming through any day now. I was thinking we might be able to get one wholesale. Of course that would mean I'd have to pay cash for it. Larry. Why didn't you tell me about the house first when we were alone? I don't know, Lou. I guess maybe I wanted to surprise you with it. Instead, Fred surprised you. Well. You know how Fred is. And so should you after all these years. I know, but it's been nice having him here for Cynthia whenever we needed him. He's a doctor. That's his business. We've paid him regularly. Yes. Even before we pay the butcher. Sure. I know, I know. But what's that got to do with the house? Why don't you want to buy the house, Lou? Because one of us has to remember. Remember what? That Napoleon was supposed to be the first step on a long journey. There she goes again. Every time she gets upset she starts talking that nonsense about a journey. Larry. - Yeah? Let's not talk of it any more tonight. - Okay. But, Lou. What am I going to tell Gus Wood? Tell him we're buying a chicken ranch in Arizona. We're off to raise eggs or feathers or .. Anything you can think of. - Okay. Not in bed yet? I'm not very sleepy, mother. Kinda chilly tonight. You might need this extra blanket. Mother. Why don't we go to Arizona? Arizona? Oh. Well, I wouldn't start packing. I'd like to go anyplace. A million miles from Napoleon. Is it that bad, baby? It isn't just that I never do anything. I never go to parties or dance or skate. It's just that no-one ever asks me anymore. Because they know I can't. And if I could. Practically everyone is going steady, mother. And I haven't even a date. But you don't understand. Of course I understand. And so will you when you have a little girl of your own. I can't understand why daddy and uncle Fred treat me as if I were always sick. Even when I am well. It's because you've been through so much. We have to be careful. For the first four years of your life .. We didn't know from one day to the next whether .. Whether .. It wasn't that .. You ever got anything other children didn't get but .. Poor baby. You got everything so much worse. Do you realize this is the first winter that you haven't been in bed with flu? Let's be sensible. Let us get through this one winter without .. Without anything. But mother. Tell you what. Tomorrow night. Tomorrow night we'll have a fitting on the blue formal .. You didn't get to wear last year. When the spring dance comes around. You'll be in there with the best of them. Mother. But you can't go to a spring dance .. Unless someone asks you. Napoleon, if you knuckle down. If you break their necks. If you make them wrecks. You can break the hex, so knuckle down. Make them yell, Napoleon. Make them scream. We can win Napoleon if we cheer the team. If you don't give in, take it on the chin. You are bound to win if you will only buckle down. If you fight you'll chuckle at defeat. If you fight your luck will not retreat. We repeat. Knuckle down, Napoleon. Knuckle down. You can win Napoleon, if you buckle down. If you hold them down. If you go to town. You can wear the crown if you will only buckle down. Thank you, Professor Rosenkrantz. Thank you all. While we are gathered in general assembly this morning. We welcome home one of our former students. Who has been very honorably absent in the United States Navy. I'm sure you all share with me my pride in Seaman Richard Latham. Who has voluntarily chosen to resume his studies at Napoleon High School. Now, we decided as you recall .. To divide Shakespeare's creative life .. Into four periods. And tomorrow we enter the fourth and final period. Which has been called the 'epoch of reposeful contemplation'. In many of his best plays we will find that .. Just a minute please. Cynthia Bishop and Richard Latham remain please. The rest of the class is dismissed. Cynthia, I feel you could spare some time after school. You might explain to Richard what we've covered so far. You don't mind, do you? It shouldn't take Richard long to catch up to the rest of us. I would be glad to, Miss Brady. Thank you. Cynthia. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Miss Brady. It must be wonderful to have a brain. I don't know. There are other things. The first thing you learn in the navy is to play down so nobody notices you. See what you got for being smart? Me. I don't mind. Really. We ought to begin with .. - Say, will this take long? No. I have to be somewhere by quarter past four. A date? It's sort-of an appointment. Great. I have sort-of an appointment myself. I hope. We had better start. The class has finished the part of Shakespeare's life we call the epoch .. It's funny I don't remember you. How come? I must have been a freshman when you left. I guess people change. Yep. They sure do. Have you ever read Macbeth? - Do I have to? If you're going to catch up with the class. Can't you just tell me what it's about? But in Shakespeare it's not only the story that counts. It's the lines themselves. The poetry. Say. Do you know the blonde who sits in that seat? Stella Regan. - You a friend of hers? She's a very good friend of my cousin, Donie. Oh. Maybe I had better tell you the story. Yeah. Sure. Go ahead. Macbeth is a Scottish chief. One night the King of Scotland comes to spend the night at Macbeth's castle. The king is killed by Macbeth and his wife. Oh. A whodunit, huh? It isn't the murder that counts. You see, Macbeth is haunted by his guilty conscience. Me too. Want a bite? No thanks. It's good for you. An apple a day and stuff. But uncle Fred says that .. - Go on. Go on. Thanks. Step down. I want to see. If I could only have one dress without such a high neck. High necks are coming in this year. Mother. Were you scared the first time you sat next to daddy? Heavens, no. But he was. Petrified. That's her story. Well, I mean it. I mean the first time you met. What did you find to talk about? Millions of things. Like what? Baseball. Baseball? Skiing. Vienna. Vienna? How does a person get started on that subject, dad? Huh? Well, once upon a time I had a notion I was going there to study medicine. Why didn't you? Well. It's awfully late, dear. Up to bed. Come along now. Goodnight, kiddo. Night. Mother. Did daddy ever seem absolutely unattainable. No. Just hard to get. But I broke him down. Upstairs now. Goodnight, honey. Goodnight. Hang your dress up carefully. We'll do another fitting tomorrow night. But you still have to have things to talk about. Say. What kind of a question was that? 'Were you scared the first time you sat next to me'? I think she has gotten herself sat next to. Huh? Oh. As this moment thou art .. Let thy loveliness fade as it will. And around the dear ruins. Each wish of my heart. Would entwine itself verdantly still. Thank you, Parker. Yes, sir. Fredonia Jannings, Professor Rosenkrantz. Clang, clang, clang went the trolley. Ding, ding, ding went the bell. Zing, zing, zing went my heartstrings. From the moment I saw him I fell. Chug, chug, chug went the motor. Bump, bump, bump went the brake. Cynthia. Cynthia Bishop. Thank you, Miss Jannings. Maybe the chorus. Cynthia, where have you been? Come. We have been waiting for you. My darling. Your place is on the stage. Not in the auditorium. Come, my darling. I cannot. I didn't think .. - You are .. You are too young to think. Rosy will do the thinking for you. Come, my darling. Don't worry. Professor. I knew it. I knew you would not disappoint Rosy. Darling, we cannot fail. Go on. Wonderful. On the level, Cynthia. You were great. Just scared to death. After hearing me sing, Rosy decided I'd make a good stage manager. Now. Take an order. Rehearsal tomorrow at .. 3:30. At Rosy's house. And be on time. I'll be there. - Sir. Sir. Well, it's getting late. I had better be going. - Wait. Just a point of etiquette. Is it alright for a mere stage manager to walk with the star of the show? Why, it's unheard of. How do you like that? Gee, look at it snow. The last snow of the year. You know the lines in Winter's Tale that go .. I know I'm going skiing if this keeps up. The greatest sport in the world. Well, I adore skiing. You do? That's swell. Hey, it's cold. You'd better button up. Why did you say that? I just said it's cold. My ears are freezing. Oh. But I love the cold. Don't you? Don't you just hate those people who always button themselves up. And tucking collars around their chins. I can't imagine anything more dull. Yes. But when it's cold, it's cold. I found out the gang still hangs out at Betty's Barn. What do you say we go? Thanks. But I have to get home. Mind if I walk you there? You already have. This is it. Mind if I walk you to the door? No. And to think that last week you were only a Shakespeare teacher. Why didn't you tell me about your voice? We were so busy talking about Stella. You know. Catching up. I talk too much. Hello mother. This is Ricky Latham - my mother. Hello Ricky. Very glad to meet you. Same here, Mrs Bishop. Won't you come in? No thanks. I was just .. Well, on my way. Glad to have met you. See you tomorrow, Cynthia. Bye, Ricky. - Come on, honey. Isn't he nice, mother? You are very late Cynthia and I've been worried. And look at you. No galoshes and your neck wide open. Where have you been? I just happened to run into Ricky after I left uncle Fred's. It seemed like I was there forever. Because McQuillan was so busy. And. And with my singing lesson and all. Well, it is so late. I think I'll do my homework right away. For heaven's sakes, mother. Don't you believe me? I haven't said a word. But you know very well I didn't go to uncle Fred's. Don't you? Alright. I stayed at school. To try out for the school play. I've been given a wonderful part. And I want to do it more than anything else in the world. And I'm going to, mother. No matter what happens. Well now. None of this sounds very impossible. Let's talk it over. You don't mean just 'talk', mother. You mean 'discuss' it. And 'let's think about it'. 'Let's make up our minds'. Isn't that what always happens? Daddy is consulted first. And then he says .. 'Well, let's leave it up to Fred. He's the doctor in the family'. And hasn't the answer always been: 'You can't, Cynthia'? I've never heard anything but 'you can't' or 'no'. All for my own good of course. But I am sick of it, mother. I would like to do something at school beside get 'A's. I'd like one friend besides Donie. Who incidentally happens to be .. To bore me. Cynthia. I've got news for you. Donie bores me too. 'The equation of a line'. 'The equation of a line is satisfied'. 'By the X-distance and the Y-distance'. [ Piano music ] Yeah. That's still an awful pretty waltz. But Lou, we've no business in using our own judgment in a thing like this. And whose judgment should we use, Larry? We should ask Fred. He's the doctor in the family. Ought we ask Carrie too, and Donie? Now, Lou. Don't exaggerate. Larry, can't you see how much this means to her? It's so much more than just being in a show. She's not a child anymore. She's growing up. And she's met this Ricky Latham. I've seen him, Larry. He's nice. Young and healthy. You can't expect him or any normal boy to stay interested in a girl who is .. Who is outside. Who isn't allowed to do anything. Yeah. Yeah. I think I see what you mean. Okay. I'm not going to be stubborn about this. We go to Carries for dinner on Thursday. We'll leave it up to Fred. If Fred says it is okay it is certainly okay with me. Hello Mack. - Larry. Come on in. - Thanks. Glad you could get here. The doctor says he'll be by as soon as he gets away from the hospital. I thought I'd visit in the meantime. Hello Mack. - Hello Lou. Sweet of you to come on your day off. Sweet, my eye. I came for a good cup of coffee. Mac, do you think that .. - Don't worry, Larry. I'll take a look at the kid. If you get me a cup of coffee. You might as well go to the store. Yeah. I guess so. Sure you don't need me round here? - No. We can manage. Call me as soon as Fred gets here. - Sure. Well. Lou, I hate to say I told you so .. Please don't, Larry. I know. But you were talking about the kid being in the show and .. She can't even get out of bed. Larry. Do you think perhaps .. you .. And Fred and me .. Maybe we're all wrong? About what? About everything. Maybe if we treated Cynthia as though she were well .. She would be well. Lou, darling. You have to stop kidding yourself. That child is sick. I know. Don't worry, honey. It will be alright. Bye. Call me, huh. - I will. Well, Mack? It looks like old-fashioned flu to me. - Oh dear. Very bad? Well, nothing a few weeks in bed won't cure. A few weeks. Poor baby. Of course, your brother-in-law might give it a fancy Latin name. But don't let that scare you. Uhoh. I know that ring. It seems we picked a busy morning for you, Fred. Sorry. I wouldn't mind but this could have been avoided. It could have you know. She simply walked home from school. - In a snowstorm. If she'd come to me for a shot .. Instead of hanging around school this wouldn't have happened. Perhaps not. - You're the mother. If you feel like encouraging Cynthia beyond her capacity that's your affair. But try to have some consideration for the hard work I have to do. Just a little consideration. That is all I ask. It's a case of flu, doctor. With your permission, McQuillan, I will make the diagnosis. It won't happen again, doctor. Coming Lou? - Right away. I'm sorry, McQuillan. How much? Plenty. Mother. Yes, honey? Would you telephone Professor Rosenkrantz. That I won't be at rehearsal today. Professor Rosenkrantz. Please. I'm awfully sorry to disturb you. I know I don't belong here with the principals. I'm in the chorus, but .. There is something I have to tell you. Well, I thought you ought to know that .. Speak, speak. Don't stand there flapping your wings like a doodlebug. Well. Cynthia won't be here. I know. - She's got flu. It is such a shame. I feel so sorry for her. Somebody will have to take her place because .. Because even after she's well my father will keep her home for two more weeks. I happen to know because my father is her doctor. Alright. I already know. Miss Jannings. As you yourself have said. You don't belong here with the principals. I thought .. You may go. Please. Well. Goodbye then. Chorus. We play the score. Donie. Yes, Ricky? Would you .. Gee, that's a tough break for Cynthia. It was silly her even trying out. Tell her that as soon as she can have visitors .. It will probably be weeks and weeks. Poor thing. You see, she is sick so much of the time. That's the reason she could never .. go steady. No kidding. Pop isn't sure exactly what's wrong with her. But he did mention something with a .. A Latin name. Gee. Well. Be sure and remember me to her. Yes. I will, Ricky. Ricky, we're ready to start. Donie, if you see Cynthia, give her my best. Bye. Goodbye. Aunt Lou. Aunt Lou! Donie. Aunt Lou. Yes, Donie? My father says it's catching and not to go in. But I just had to stop by and see how Cynthia was. And keep her posted on all the news. And. There isn't much except that I think Isabelle Green will get Cynthia's part. I've just come from rehearsal. I'm sure you ran with the news. Thank you very much. Ask her if there are any messages for me. Are there any messages for Cynthia? No. Oh yes. Stella sends her love. Bye. Hello Professor. A big night, huh? - Yes, Mrs Bishop. Tonight .. tonight we open. Nervous? I am, yes. But enthusiastic .. I am not. My heart is not there. It is here. May I see Cynthia for a minute? Of course. She's downstairs now. Right in there. Cynthia. Hello Professor. Cynthia. It is the premier. But what does that mean? Unless the Prima-donna receives her flowers. Thank you, Professor. So my dear, with compliments. Affection and admiration. For the wonderful performance you will give. Next year. We will produce The Student Prince, Mrs Bishop. And she will sing the part of Kate. And now tonight she will begin to study her part. Say, Lou. Hello Professor. I'm sorry I cannot come to your show. But my boss is in Florida and I must take inventory down at the store. Well goodnight, kiddo. Come on now. What kind of a face is that? Ah, that's better. She hoped she'd be well enough to come and see the show. But Fred thought we should not take the chance. But you can listen to it on the radio. It will sound just as good. Won't it, Professor? Radio is wonderful. - A great invention. Goodnight, kiddo. Goodnight, Professor. You won't be late, will you? - No. I'll be home early. Goodnight. Well. Goodnight, friends. Tonight, when I conduct each note I will dedicate it to you. Goodnight, darling. - Goodnight, Professor. I wish Isabelle Green luck. Goodnight, Professor. - Goodnight. Good luck. Luck? With that voice of Isabelle Green we can hope for luck? Ha. This song we have taken out because her voice has no top. That song we take out because she has no bottom. And her middle? Luck, we will need. Sheesh. Come. Come here. Cynthia. Cynthia. When I was your age. There were certain things I had my heart set on too. And when I found out I couldn't have them. I felt just the way you do now. I was sure I would never get over it. But later on. You find out. Things that happen now are not really important. School shows. Dates. They are little things. You have a wonderful life ahead of you. A rich, full life. With a husband and children. After all, honey. You aren't sixteen yet. Why, you are so young. You were young too. Cynthia. I promise you. From now on things will be different. How can they be? Daddy won't change. Uncle Fred won't change. But we will. We will. Good morning, Cynthia. Glad to see you back, dear. Thank you, Miss Brady. Cynthia, you've been away? Yes. See you in class. Hi, Cynthia. Hello Ricky. - How do you feel? Wonderful. It was just a good excuse to play hookey. I'm sure glad to see you back. Ricky. Look. That's swell. I'll be seeing you. Hiya, Cynthia. You have about one minute to finish your paper. I've got something to tell you. I was having breakfast this morning when I got a wire from Beulah from Chicago. She said if I can come up this Saturday .. She has a date for me with a college boy who's terribly interesting. I tell you, Stella. Our dance is this Friday. A high school Prom. This is a college fraternity dance. Gosh, what excuse can you give Ricky? It's practically standing him up. As my best friend, Donie, I'm asking you to try and think of something. Well. Alice. Stella. I've got a brilliant idea. - What? Your grandmother in Chicago has had a sudden heart attack, see. And you had to suddenly leave. You could even tell Ricky it was a coronary. That is a medical term. - I see. So Stella had to suddenly leave for Chicago. Do you realise what that means? You mean her old lady is going to die or something? Ricky Latham hasn't a date for the Prom. Oh .. Gee. I think that's terrible. Considering he was in the service. Don't you? Yeah. It's awful. We ought to do something about that. Well, I will see you later. Will, would you be willing to break your date with me? Gee whiz, Donie. It will be just as painful for me, Will. It seems the least we can do. Yeah. But then I will be stuck. You could take Cynthia. Cynthia? My father says she's never felt better in her life. I'm sure she would be delighted to be asked. Yeah. But at the last minute I will be left high and dry. She just isn't reliable. - Will Parker. I'm beginning to realize what you really are. Small and selfish and .. Unpatriotic. Well. Alright. How do you feel? Hello Will. Fine thanks. All better, huh? - Uhuh. Donie is going to the dance with Ricky. It's alright with me. You see, Stella had to go to Chicago all of a sudden so .. That left Ricky without a date. So Donie figured that with him being a veteran and all, that it wasn't fair. So she thought she ought to go with him. That was very considerate. I practically made her do it. Heck. I am as patriotic as the next fellow. But it still kinda leaves me without anybody. So .. I was wondering. I mean. Well, I would be very glad to take you if .. If you think you can make it. Well. I would like to go to the dance. Well, that's that. I'll keep in touch with you. And take good care of yourself. No. No, Donie. No. I haven't the faintest idea. Cynthia is here now. You'd better talk to her about it. Hello Donie? Cynthia Bishop. Of all the dirty, double-crossing tricks. But Donie. But Donie. Your own flesh and blood. To do a thing like that to me. I never want to speak to you again. As long as either one of us lives. A sweet-tempered monster. What happened? I don't know, mother. I was invited to the spring Prom. You were? That is wonderful. By Will Parker. But didn't Donie know? I am positive she did. That's why I don't understand. She is going with Ricky. Hi. Hello. Well, Cynthia. He looks honest. I think we should let him in. I am sorry. Please do. How are you, Mrs Bishop? - Just fine, Ricky. I hope you'll excuse me. I am right in the midst of .. Baking a cake. Would you come in and .. Sit down. No thanks. I will only be a minute. That is. If I can explain it in a minute. It's kind-of complicated see. Anyway, Stella .. - Yes, I know. She had to leave town. - Yeah. So Donie said something about my going with her but .. That left Will Parker without a date. Which wasn't at all fair to Will Parker. Yeah. So I talked it over with Will and .. He went to see Donie and I've come to .. To ask you if .. Well. Well, the dance is Friday night and I thought if .. I would love to. You would? That's swell. I didn't know if you would be able to go out at night. But I feel just fine. Well then, it's a date. Did I tell you the dance is Friday? Yes. I believe it is Friday. See you Friday then. So long. Bye. Mother. Hello? Mrs Bishop? This is Ricky Latham. It .. It seems to be raining a little bit. Well, I was just sort of checking. 8:30 won't be too early for Cynthia, will it Mrs Bishop? No. Of course not. Alright. Who was that? - Ricky Latham. Who? Ricky Latham. What did he want? He wanted to know if Cynthia could go to the dance tonight. What did you tell him? You heard me, dear. I said 'no, of course not'. It's nearly 8 o'clock. What time are we due at the Boosters tonight Larry? Oh yeah. I never could figure out why they have the Boosters meeting on a Friday night. Why don't they have it on Saturday night so you can sleep in Sunday? Boy oh boy. Listen to that rain. April showers bring May flowers you know. I got a darned good notion to stay home tonight. Fred is up for re-election as Chief Booster, isn't he? Yeah, Yeah. Fred will win at a walk. You wouldn't make a bad Chief Booster yourself. Come on now. I wouldn't have a chance against him. Larry Bishop. I am amazed at you. Certainly, for the sake of the wife and kiddies you'd make a fight for it. For the wife and kiddies .. - Come on, lazy. I'd do practically anything. Don't rush me. Take it easy. Say, kiddo. You look a little flushed. - I feel fine, dad. You do? Get to bed early and get a good night's rest. Night, darling. - Night, dad. Better take her temperature. Wow. Not a fit night out for man nor beast. You got a closed car. You girls are lucky. You stay here where it's dry. Ah, Lou. I don't think I'll go. Don't be silly. Go on and have some fun. Alright. Bye. Goodbye, dear. Well, what are we waiting for? Just a minute. Mother. Two lips should be enough for any woman. What time did he say he was coming? He said he would be here at 8:30 and you've asked me that seven times. I'm sorry. Try this on for size. [ Doorbell ] There he is. - Wait a minute. You could go down that way but people might talk. Put your dress on now. I'll take your coat down. Count slowly to one hundred. And then come on down. - Yes, mother. Good evening, Ricky. - Evening, Mrs Bishop. Cynthia isn't ready. Come in for a minute. I will just leave these things outside. They're kind-of wet. Go on in and sit down. - Thank you. Dreadful weather, isn't it. You got a closed car? No. But we won't get wet, Mrs Bishop. My top doesn't leak. Not much. - Oh. Well, sit down. I'll see if I can get some music on the radio. Cynthia shouldn't be long but you know women. Hmm? Oh sure. What time do you think the dance will be over? About twelve, I guess. - Oh. Then the real fun begins. No telling where the crowd will go. Afterwards. Hello Ricky. Jeepers. Hello. You're a bit early, aren't you? I guess I am. No. We are a bit late. What a dope. I forgot to ask what color dress you were wearing so I .. So I got these. I hope they are alright. Ricky, they are lovely. Mother, look. How sweet. Oh .. do I have to? Well, it's a bit damp outside. Let me help you. Come on, sit down. You really need these. You know, on a rainy night everyone starts out wearing galoshes. How else could people lose them? There. I had better go and get the umbrella. Now your coat. Mother, it will crush these. Just across your shoulders. Mother, isn't he .. Yes he is. And you're not too angry about what I did to the dress? I'm furious. Ready. Have a good time now you two. - Thank you, Mrs Bishop. Goodbye, mother. - Bye, honey. Pick up your dress so it won't get wet. And drive carefully. We will. Will, you're practically the only one here wearing a tuxedo. Yeah. My father says it will fit me perfectly next year. Well. Of all the .. Cynthia. Hello Donie. Hello Will. - Hiya, Ricky. What are you doing out on a night like this? Didn't my father know you were coming? I am sure he'll be furious when he finds out. What a gorgeous dress. Thank you. You're so lucky your mother can sew. Yes. She ought to make one for you, Donie. She can make clothes fit practically anyone. Come on, let's dance. For he's a jolly good fellow. That nobody can deny. And nobody can deny. Nobody can deny. For he's a jolly good fellow. He's a jolly good fellow. He's a jolly good fellow that nobody can deny. That nobody can deny. That nobody can deny. For he's a jolly good fellow. Larry. Hi, sweetheart. Hello, dear. Well, come on. Aren't you going to ask me? What? Mrs Bishop, you're looking at the newly elected Chief of the Boosters Club. No. - Yes. I nosed out Fred by six votes. I felt bad beating old Fred but you know the old saying: may the best man win. I'll get another cup. Don't bother. I had a couple of .. Say, what are you doing up so late? Waiting for Cynthia. What did you say? I'm waiting up for Cynthia, Larry. She went to the dance. Larry. Larry. Larry, don't. That's foolish. You would break her heart. Lou, why did you do it? Because it was the most important thing in her life and I wanted her to have it. You sent her out on a night like this? Yes. You lied to me. Yes. You. You took a chance on .. Someone, Larry. Finally someone in this house had to take a chance. But Lou, the kid is sick. There's a sickness here. Worse than Cynthia's. What? What are you talking about? You, Larry. You are sick. Sick with fear. Every day of your life you're afraid of saying or doing something that .. That Carrie or Fred may disapprove of. - Lou. You're afraid of Dingle. Of your job. Plodding along, year after year. Simply because you haven't the courage to demand what's coming to you. Maybe you should have married a millionaire. You know I never gave a hang about money. All I ever wanted was to feel proud of you. To feel that we were living our own lives. With a little dignity. Dignity? Oh, sure. Dignity. Dignity like you've got. The one way to be dignified in this town is to have money in the bank like you. Sure. You are dignified. Yes. I've got money in the bank. But it's not going to be used to buy this house. And tie us to Napoleon for the rest of our natural lives. It's going to be used to get us out of here. So that somehow we can find a little of what we dreamed. Before it's too late. It's too late now, Lou. It was too late the day Cynthia was born. It seems that sometimes you can't choose the things that you want. God or fate or whatever else you call it steps in, and .. Does the choosing for you. I'm not so sure it wasn't a good choice after all. I admit that once in a while I read of a doctor making a great medical discovery. And I shut my eyes and imagine that it's me. But then I look at Cynthia. And you. I wouldn't swap shoes with the greatest doctor in the whole world. Maybe I've been wrong all these years trying to make the best I could of it. But that's the way I am I guess. Only I never thought you hated me for it. Okay, boys. Sign off. It isn't all over? - Over? We haven't started. We're going to Benny's Barn. Benny's Barn? Where are you going from here, kids? We're going to Benny's Barn. Be seeing you. [ Singing ] But wait. You'll never make it unless you swim. I had better carry you. Hold tight. Goodnight, again. I hate to go. You had better get in and take off those wet shoes. Why do you say things like that? Because I figured out something tonight. Promise you won't be angry at what I am going to say. I promise. Remember the day I walked you home from school? When it began to snow real hard? You didn't have to open your coat the way you did. I mean. You didn't have to prove anything. I don't care even if you do catch colds easily. After tonight. I wouldn't even care if you couldn't dance. It wouldn't change you any. I wish you could come in but .. Yes. It is kind of late. Well. You. You won't forget, will you? And you won't? Goodnight. Goodnight. Well. How was it, honey? It was wonderful. Do you feel alright? Oh, I feel fine. Mother. Ricky kissed me goodnight. And look. His ring. Well. Honey, look at your dress. And your shoes. You did lose your galoshes. I am awful sorry, mother. I was having such a wonderful time. Do you know what we did? I know what you're doing right now. You'll go upstairs and get those wet things off. But don't you want to hear .. - Of course I will, honey. But Later. I gather the evening was a success. A success? Oh, it was spectacular. Sit down. Let's get your shoes off. I was sort of .. Big news I guess. - Really? Everyone wanted to dance with me. But Ricky wouldn't let them. Except during the special cut-ins. And then he kept cutting in himself. These shoes are soaked. And the decorations in the gym, mother. They were just beautiful. Your feet are just like ice. Honestly. The whole night seemed just like five minutes. I could hardly believe it when they started to play Auld Lang Syne. Get out of your dress now. Put on your slippers. And the orchestra was just out of this world. And my dress, mother. Three of the girls thought it came from Chicago. They ought to see it now. Put this on. And wait until I tell you about Donie. Will Parker tripped and knocked over the punch bowl. And Donie found herself in the middle of the floor just swimming in .. Punch. You get right into a hot bath. No more talking tonight. Get your pyjamas. Be careful. Don't wake your father. Mother. Was he very angry? We'll talk about it in the morning. Go on now, honey. I must have overslept. Yes. I guess I did too. I made some coffee. Can I get you some eggs or something? No thank you. This will be enough. How .. how was Cynthia? I don't know. I thought it best not to wake her. I'll get another cup. [ Doorbell ] I'll go. Good morning. - Morning, Professor. Excuse me for calling so early. But it is never too early for congratulations. My heartiest congratulations. Thank you, but .. Even the Boosters can make a mistake. The Boosters? What Boosters? I am talking about Cynthia. Mrs Bishop. - Good morning, Professor. Good morning. What a catastrophe. You were not at the dance to see her with your own eyes. She was .. As brilliant as a queen. And treated. Boy. Wonderful. - That's very nice of you. Will you have some coffee? - Coffee? A Viennese refuse coffee? Never. Last night. The music, the dancing. Just like my old days. The student part is after the opera in Vienna. I cannot forget Vienna and Viennese restaurants. The wine and the beer. Remember Mrs Bishop? When you first came to Napoleon. The stories I used to tell you about the old Vienna. And how we talked for hours and hours. But now. I tell you a secret. In the middle of everything last night. I say to myself. Vienna. What is Vienna? Why do I talk about things in the past? Here I am happy like a king. Even with little things. My productions at the school and the children there. Cynthia in her glory last night. Those things are good too. Yes. I have made my own Vienna. Right here in Napoleon. Well. If you'll excuse me, Professor. I'm a little late. I must get down to the store. Maybe you can drop me off at my studio? Sure, Professor. My own car has a sprained axle and the klitch is broken. The 'clutch', Professor. Klitch, clutch. I don't mind. I'm not a mechanic. I tell you another secret. Here even the coffee is better than in Vienna. Larry. Goodbye. Bye. Morning, Larry. Morning, Joe. Hello, Larry. Congratulations. Thank you. You know the Boosters are .. - Boosters? I mean Cynthia. I hear she was the belle of the ball. Well. Congratulations, Larry. She always was a pretty kid. - She? I mean The Boosters. Gosh, where have you been? The boss got back from Florida this morning. And the vacation didn't help his temper any. He's been screaming his head off for you. The one morning you pick to be late he breezes in. Oh. He. He said to take a good look at this. I think he is a little mad. He also said. If anyone in this store thought he was indispensable, he could quit. Quit? You'd better go in and square yourself. Don't worry, Larry. He will get over it. Larry! Tell him you'll work late tonight. Okay, J.M. You asked for it. Here it is. - Larry. I guess every man decides for himself just how much he's going to take and .. Well, I've had my fill. And forget about that ten-dollar raise. It isn't a question of money. I never gave a hang about money at all. A man only has one life and I think he ought to live it with a little dignity. Of course you wouldn't understand about dignity, J.M. When you're ready to return to Florida and stay there .. And stop pretending that you run this store. Look me up. - Now look here. And another thing, J.M. That $100,000 that you gave me. Well, I'm giving it back to you. You're a good businessman, J.M. You'll know what to do with it. I tell you if they ever get that canal through. Napoleon will have a 100,000 population. And this property will be right smack the center of the high-rent district. Excuse me a minute, Gus. - Huh? I said, excuse me. - Yes. Of course. Larry. What are you doing back home? How is Cynthia? She is .. She's still asleep. What's all this? Golly. It's almost ten o'clock. She didn't get to bed until two. Larry, what happened? Lou. Don't you let anyone tell you that I was fired. I quit. You're kidding. No. I'm not. J.M. got back this morning and he spoke a little bit out of turn. So I went right in to him and I said 'Look here, J.M'. 'A man has only one life and ..' 'I think he ought to live it with a little ..' 'With a little dignity'. Larry. Yes. That's just what I said to him. So. I guess as soon as we can get packed up around here. We'll be pushing off for Chicago. But Larry. Gus. Congratulations. Congratulations. Now wait a minute. Is this on account of Cynthia or .. On account of the great fortunes in this country all sprung from real estate. Here's the receipt for your down payment and I will be seeing you in escrow. Goodbye, Lou. Lou. Yes, Larry. I have bought the house. Holy smoke. And me without a job. Gus. Hey, Gus. Wait a minute. Morning. Carrie. We didn't wait for your call, Lou. Though I can well imagine the condition Cynthia is in this morning. Carrie, please. I'm not here professionally. You won't like this Larry, but the time has come to stop mincing words. A conscientious doctor can do just so much. I consider sending Cynthia out last night unforgivable. And frankly, I think you had better get yourselves another physician. Let us assure that this has nothing whatsoever to do with .. With your Cynthia upsetting a punch bowl over our Fredonia. Personally, I would recommend Dr Taylor. In my name he might make some concession in his fees. I don't know why he should, Fred. You never have. Well. Really. Fred. Mother. Yes, honey? Mother. Why did you let me sleep so late? Didn't I tell you? - Tell me what? I don't think you should be .. - Please uncle Fred. I have a date with Ricky. A bunch of us are going to the carnival. I must get something to eat before I leave. And if Danny Johnson calls .. Just tell him I'm not home as I won't have time to talk to him or anyone else. Well, Fred? It looks like you've come to the wrong address. The. The child is obviously overstimulated. Come, Carrie. If she were still my patient. I would put her to bed. Say, Lou. Do you suppose the kid really crowned Donie with the punchbowl? I don't know. But I hope so. Wait a minute, honey. What are you crying about? It's so funny. Cynthia. The house. And your job. All on the same morning. I guess I'm all hysterical. Now, honey. Don't cry. Don't cry. Look. I'll see Gus and I'll take care of the house deal and .. Then I'll contract that fellow Collins in Chicago. If that doesn't work out there's a dozen other places I can locate. Dad. Congratulations. Mother, look. His picture is on the front .. What's the matter? - Nothing. Your mother is alright. Kiddo. How would you like to live in Chicago? - Chicago? And leave Napoleon? Why? Your dad had a little argument with Mr Dingle. And I quit my job. What is so tragic about that? All you have to do is to go down and see Mr Dingle and apologise. Apologise? Me? I'm sure he'd take you back. Before I'd got back to that store .. That windbag would have to crawl up to our front door with his hat in his hand. You always said you hated it here. That you wanted to leave. I never said anything. Anyhow. A girl can change her mind, can't she? If you and dad have decided to go to Chicago. Then you can go without me. I simply can't. Don't you understand? Ricky and I are .. Are going steady. Well. They are going steady. Dad. What? - Look. Daddy. His hat is in his hands. ..r-o-s..
