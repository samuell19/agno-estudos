Good afternoon. Welcome to the 1 o'clock news. A single headline today: France has ground to a halt, millennials have vanished from every city and town. They're gone. Good morning. Open your books to... This can't be happening. It won't stop! Where's the intern? Supernatural phenomenon or political demonstration? Experts are scratching their heads. I dream of a world without the young. A world where we stay in bed and boycott the system. But the fact is I'm Zoe, I'm twenty-one, and my world's as real as it gets. And now new data published this morning, the millennial jobless rate. 40% of master's degrees are still jobless a year after graduation... Morning. Since I left home, I've had everyday schizophrenia. In the same day, I'm a marketing intern, student and waitress. So I inevitably get lost sometimes. Zoe, you look like shit. Good morning. Know how I stay beautiful? An hour of Pilates 3 times a week. It awakens my senses. I have an hour bus ride. I like my senses dull. You still take the bus? I just couldn't. By the way, I'm testing your replacement today. You'll train him, OK? You're sweet. But 20-somethings are better off not complaining. May I? Enjoy youth while it lasts. You'll see at my age. Please move to the back of the bus. Remember the intonation? I hope I'm not boring you, Miss. STARVING GENERATION Not all millennials are equal. My boyfriend Max belonged to another caste. Hey, Babe. Look what the guys got me! A fashion photographer, he was all hipster. And that night the hipsters played... bocce ball? Hey. Are you Max's girlfriend? I'm Marynn. "Y-N-N." I'm Zoe. "Z-O-E." I'm Max's new intern. Seriously, I looked like shit while she was out of a Pharrell Williams video. Not having 3 day jobs does wonders for the skin. This with a bomber jacket and Nikes! It's important, my clothes are the only thing I can control. Teacher's college never prepared us for real students. You'll do fine. Yeah, right. Kyoto, here I come! Kyoto? So you're really gonna... go open the concept store? That's the plan. I know but did you buy your tickets, do you have a date? Not yet. Soon. It depends on Max's schedule. He works so much. Maybe you should, like, re-enroll at school in case. Flights get cancelled. No need. It'll happen any day now. But... Working together is a little nuts, isn't it? I would guess. You're not scared? Girl, check this out. Not bad, but it's August. This I like. - Cute. - Finders keepers. Dinner, Princess. What about you? I can't stay. They need me at the studio. Contract issue. Anyway, they need me. Do I have everything? You're not angry? Sure? It was all planned. I would finish my internship, get my diploma, and leave school. Then we'd begin real life together. I love it! You're beautiful, my love. It was gonna be great. Excuse me, Ma'am? Shit. It's Mr. Delouille, from the bank. I'm calling about your account. You've been overdrawn for 2 months. I sent you an email. We're not a charity, OK? Don't expect special treatment. Am I clear? Of course. I understand. I have to go. I really need my internship credits. Tomorrow. I've been waiting a half-hour for a stamp. I don't have all day. Not all day. We're only open mornings. You didn't need a degree in my day. But now... Now with the crisis we're screwed either way. Not in front of Paul! I have a goal, which is better than most. That's all great, but what if Mom and I cut you off? We had a deal. No help after graduation. Fine, cut me off. Because between Mom's organic leek farm, and your early retirement. Early retirement? Homemaking's not work? That's not what I meant. Your 300 euros a month helped but it wasn't enough. She's right about the crisis. We're told we'll all be jobless. That spending money is a virtue. Money we'll never have without a job. And if we do find one it'll be disappointing. Be realistic Zoe. You'll have to settle for an unhappy life too. Is your homework done? Guess who graduated! You look happy. We have to talk, love. Over Champagne? Of course. It's about Kyoto. I'll get glasses. I just got an offer. - Yeah? - Yeah. A gig in Shanghai. Great! They want me to do all the Hermes windows. Hermes! That's good for us. So we'd go from Shanghai? Not really. You know the biz. In this milieu, one gig leads to another, then you get asked to do a third. Hold on... Max? Level with me, OK? It's an amazing, crazy opportunity. Shanghai. I mean China... It beats Japan. What are you saying? I've worked hard on this store. I even got a specialized degree. And I don't speak Chinese! I know you don't. That's why I bring it up. Remember... the intern? Marynn? So nice. Turns out my little intern is half-Chinese and speaks it fluently. So we... I thought maybe she could come with me... or not. Nothing is decided. But she could translate for me. I like the idea, but... Help me out here, Max. Are you fucking your intern? Where'd you get that from? Your expression. What's this? Answer me, Max! - You can see. - What is it? A mistake. I'll explain. No, you won't. So in two minutes I lost everything: my boyfriend, my flat, and my future. The only thing I had left was to stay proud. Stay proud... Stay proud... Back to square one. Tonight a tell-all expose. Young Jihadists. They have France in a cold sweat. Hundreds have joined ISIS. It's an old story: With no jobs or hope and inadequate housing, they're unmoored. What is it? You're not too unmoored? Zoe, quick question. I heard something on a talk show... What's a "turkey slap"? Sorry, Dad. I don't know. A turkey slap, Dad, is a slap with your penis. Thanks. I don't even know how to hold their interest. I mean, they have the attention span of kittens. Plus, they're obsessed with American series. So my French history lessons... At least you have a goal. Yes. That's enough. Stop with the self-pity. It's been almost a month. Snap out of it. Easy to say. Look, I've kept my mouth shut, but enough is enough. You're better without him. He was an asshole. I couldn't stand him. - Really? - Yes. He and his friends showing off with their stupid knitted caps. You deserve better. - Think so? - Sure I do. What do I do? I planned everything with him. Yeah, but... Maybe that's the problem. Now you can live your own life, beholden to no one. That's good. Where's the class president who protested the lunch menu? The one who yelled the loudest, where is she? Totally. You're so right. This isn't the 19th century. I don't need a man. Exactly. Come on. We're going to celebrate. Come on. No! No old people. It can't hurt. - But can it help? - Maybe. My lovely young ladies! How are you? Maud told me about you and Max. I'm sorry. I need a drink. Want anything? Morphine, maybe. A pretty girl like you will rebound in 5 minutes. Look how young you are. You have so much time. How's Lucas? Maud said he's back home. Sure. He's readjusting. At least I think so. Hello. He should be here. Well, I'll just... Hello. Hi. Zoe? Lucas? I've changed, right? No... A little, I guess. Hey. Sorry. How are you? Great. How about you? My sister said you graduated. Nothing spectacular, but it's a start. How was Australia? It was lots of things. It's hard to sum up 3 years, but... How about you? Don't get me started, believe me. Try me. I left school, dumped my boyfriend. I'm looking for a flat and a job. Basically. You need a flat? 80 sq. meters for under 300 euros, without a full-time job. In Paris of course. - That's funny. - Is it? Yes. I have just the place for you. Really? I've been living with friends and our Chinese roommate just left. Seriously? - Interested? - Totally. Can you talk to them? Totally. Awesome. Yeah, cool. Hi. I'm Jon. Hi. I'm here for the room. Zoe. Hey. Come in. Everyone, this is Zoe, who I told you about. David and Eva, our soap stars. Soap stars? You'll understand soon enough. Chris. Resident lesbian. What she said. My pleasure. - Jon. - My Lady. Kind Sir. And Arthur. Our elder. You can call him Gandalf. Hi everyone. Welcome. That's your room. I quickly felt I belonged. They were a family, fights and all. - Stop it. - Get real! I've had it. Mom's a born worrier! But you're a realtor like she wanted. Maybe our finances worry her. That's news to me. She cares... We don't need your mother. I support you. Wait, you "support me"? Are you kidding? That's disgusting. I work my ass off to get ahead. 75 hours a week! For both of us! One day Mr. Plaza will hire me! Stop... stop it with him. You're obsessed. Do you want to fuck him? - I wouldn't say no. - Listen to yourself! What, do I suck in bed? Here we go! Arthur? - You're great in bed. - Obviously! - How do you know? - I hear. - He's right. - Look at this mess. I can't work, be great in bed, and clean up! Morning, noon and night, David and Eva found an excuse to argue. But their quarrels always ended the same way. Hey. Shit... Later! Do the dishes, you lazy bums. - I've got work. - Me too. Shake a leg, kids. I'm tired just looking at you. That's Arthur. Shit, I'm late. After 9 years in the house, he'd seen his share of us millennials. Cap! I love you. Tsch√ºss! Morning everybody! Hey. Hi, Delphine. Catch last night's game? Hey, Marco. Hi, buddy. He'd been slaving away for 5 years at a bank, hoping for a promotion. Arthur? Morning, Mr. Bernier. Have a nice weekend? Not really. I'm looking at your recent numbers. It's pitiful, Arthur. Sell me stock portfolios, man. And fast. Am I clear? Of course. Good. Chris had an MBA in international business with honors. But her career hadn't exactly taken off. When you're done, tidy up the fitting room. Sorry. What do you think? Jon, can you fix the box? I can't get online. Enough with the box. What's his problem? Jon wasn't a morning person. Hey. Nights he lived his dream... ...or pretended he did. But he worked too. Spicy pepperoni for Caroline? Have you tried pressing reset? Are you kidding? I've pressed reset 30 times! Of course. Did you keep it pressed down? I'm not a moron, son. Give me the manager. I'm not getting a tech lesson from you. - Certainly, Sir. - Unbelievable! Right away, Sir. Hello, this is Jean-Philippe. How can I help you? I take the 7:26 train like always. No, I won't be late! Don't put Dad on, I... Hi, Daddy. How are you? Coffee, please. What game have you been working on? Nick the Seal 7. It's about... Seals? - Know it? - Nope. Big tween hit. It's very fulfilling... creatively speaking. Let's talk later. I have to get to work. Love you. Bye. - David sends his love. - Sure. 7 a.m. is a little early for them to call. Don't start. She heard there was a traffic jam. On the train? Not now, David! I don't even have time for coffee. You always make me late! - Sure. - You're impossible, my love! Bye, everyone. Bye. I love you. Today, I'm working on a spec article to show editors. Like Bob Woodward. Who? Bob Woodward. He blew the lid off Watergate. Redford. All the President's Men. What are your plans Zoe? Today I'm getting a job. A real one. Cool. Job hunting makes your head spin. Job counselors say one thing, and employers another. A marketing degree, 3 internships... And I see 7... 8... 9... employers in two years. I've always found it stimulating to diversify my experience. Diversity is good. Emphasize that. Your resume tells me you lack direction. Your resume is a little lackluster. Avoid comic sans. Maybe with a more dynamic font. I thought it looked professional. That's OK. English level. Fluent. Can you translate the phrase... Mr. Bileron's in a meeting. Can I take a message? Listen... Honestly... Good attitude. You lack experience. But the ad said "entry level." Not entry-entry. You're young. It's a plus. You'll bounce back. Update your file. Good luck. - Got your jobless card? - Why? It's a poverty-line party: welfare recipients only. I knew it was your scene. Welcome to the poorhouse! Hey, guys! Just a sec. Your attention, please. Thank you. The Dept. of Labor has set the new poverty line at 840 euros a month. Under that, you are officially considered poor. David has a dirty mind. But it's so sweet what he did for Eva! He's rekindling the romance. He put candles everywhere. It's cute. C'mon. It's romantic. We were right to leave them. You're a journalist? Yeah. Freelance. I want to stay honest. My model's Bob Woodward. Who? He'll never score like that. - Your technique's better? - Yes! - What is it? - Jon claims that... Wait! He won't tell it right. It's a pick-up line. 2 out of 3... Guaranteed. Watch. So you're dancing with a girl. There's chemistry. It's not just some random girl. I didn't say anything. But you wanna get laid. My technique... You get close, you grab her and pull her in, and you whisper: "I'm dying to eat your pussy." Not convinced? You're in the minority. I promise it works. We'll find out. - No. - Yes. Ready to go? I'm a crazy mofo. Seriously? He's wasted. Don't we stop him? No. You creep! Great technique. Not for guys, anyway. Why not? For girls it's a cinch. Yeah, right. Wanna bet? So it works for girls. It works for guys too. It just takes some skill. Greetings. Going somewhere? My shift is over. I have a kid to babysit. You're not to be seen out of uniform. This isn't Best Western. Stand here. And smile. This is absurd. Don't you have to go? It'll only be another hour. An hour? Mister? I've waited long enough. I'm leaving. One moment. What are you doing? I have to go. You're cute. Now go wait over there. Cute? Who the hell are you? I'm paying you. Not for an hour now. Do you realize who I am? I have a pretty good idea. A low-level manager with no power. So if you have a complex, buy a big car. Just get off my case. My shift's over. I'm not staying just to please you. I'm calling your agency! Call whoever you want. Guys? Did someone die? I almost hung myself with the phone cord today. Not one customer was civil. I had to decline 3 students with no guarantors. I colored in a finger all day. Not funny. Just boring. Turns out the character's armless. Game about handicaps. I got a job today. - Awesome! - Yeah, great. But when I complained it paid minimum wage, they fired me. Shortest turnover in history. I was this close to selling my article... till they found out my age. So they asked me to intern. - Paid? - Under 2 months, so unpaid. Well, I'm good. My boss chewed me out. But... I had hot pockets for lunch. I love hot pockets! How about you, Zoe? That's when it hit me. Something's off, no? Off? We live in France. We're young and healthy. We're cultivated and competent. So why do we sit here every night bitching about how everyone holds our youth against us? We do sound pathetic. Can't you see? We share more than Facebook and Beyonc√©. Millennials aren't just a generation, we're a social class. It's crazy. We get nothing for our labor. And their excuse? It makes us stronger? Bullshit. Seriously. We have to stop being chumps. Adults always say, "It's normal, you're young." This morning... How many times? So being young means getting exploited at work? It means living like sardines? No way. Look at this place! We deserve better, don't we? True. Got a dictionary? The book? Is this 1912? Here. OK. Young. "Naive, "gullible, "immature, "lacking, "and poor." "Poor" sounds right. That's harsh. Older is better. That doesn't describe us. We line up to scrub toilets or do data entry. Where will it end? This is war! Time for action. Enough drinking the Kool-Aid. Let's make a list of what we won't accept. Redlines. A charter? Exactly. But we need a name. The Rebels? Too literal. The Oppressed? Too negative. Sorry to interrupt, but can we eat real food? Tots. Frozen pizza? - No more pizza. - What, then? I'm starving. That's it! What? The Starving. Because we're hungry. Yeah, great! Great, but what do we eat? Just because I'm young doesn't mean.... I'll do a demeaning internship. Instead of a paying job. Cool. Accept low wages. Agreed. Even undeclared. Get treated like shit. Let's say "disrespected." "Disrespected like shit." Same difference. Work harder because I'm black. That's good. That blows! With my beard, I get stopped 3 times a day. That blows too! To be denied responsibility. 75-hour weeks. Exactly. I never saw the 35-hour week. 35 hours, where are you? Having to choose the wrong career. That's important. Being infantilized by our folks. Totally. Hear that, honey? Direct hit! Underline that. Well, honey? Get off my case. Holy shit! You weren't kidding. STARVING GENERATION You don't fool around. Were you up all night? Dope. Hi, everyone. This video inaugurates the new Starving website. At least I hope so. The site is for us millennials. But it's also addressed to you adults. We're here, everywhere. We're in schools and universities, building tomorrow's dreams. We're in your shops, in your homes babysitting. We're in stockrooms and at registers. In bars and restaurants, in the urban hoods, and in the countryside. We started this site to explain... why we're already tired at the dawn of our lives. Why our generation born yesterday is already exhausted. This site is here to get the word out. By us, on our behalf, and for everyone else. Hey, guys. Welcome. Come in. Everyone's here. It's a blast, have fun. Sorry. Pardon me. Hey, buddy... No buddies here. Clean up. I'm not your father. I'm not your daddy. But the party's not over! Don't clean up, then. Let everything go to shit. - Have you seen Zoe? - We're talking. Hey, dude? Guys? It looks great. No, I'm half-naked. I'm no stripper! Not at all. There's still fabric on your skin. You'd prefer Chewbacca? Why don't I have a dress? Star Wars geek! - What? - You're a geek! Hey, dude. Jon? Seen Zoe? Over there. You call that a costume? I didn't have time to change after work. What are you? Guess. Super Mario? Jos√© Bov√©? Oh, I know! Georges Brassens. Edwy Plenel. That's a tough one. Is my sister coming? She teaches tomorrow. School's made her a nun. And you're a party animal? Wanna dance? Maybe later? Come on. Wait. It's falling off. Sorry. Are you OK? Thanks. You're welcome. Shall we? Coming? Hey, Starving Generation. Here's a tour of my workplace. She's lost it. Vote her out! M√©lanie stays. She's fresh. She should run for president. - A reality-TV government! - We've got one now. - Chris! - They do argue a lot. It's true. They never listen. They're media whores. In an ivory tower. Look. It's insane! It's taken off! 200 posts in under a week. It's the Charter 2.0. Holy shit! In so little time. I know her! I do. Introduce me. Now I don't know if Kim cheated on Anto with Carl. Who cares! Know what the problem with the Charter is? It's too negative. She's right. Positive, all the way. Change the first sentence... Yes. "I'm young..." "I'm capable." "I can." I'M YOUNG AND I DESERVE: Time for action. We decided to disrupt, like in Fight Club. Tuesday was fight day. Nice. Our modest yet ambitious goal: attack the system from within. Sabotage it little by little without arousing suspicion. Sorry. To tell you the truth, I wouldn't bank here if I were you. Never. No way. See? That's the Big Dipper. Second star to your left is the Little Dipper. And Orion's Belt? Orion's Belt's more complicated. - Thank you. - Come again. Great work, Arthur. Where's J√©r√¥me? Call him. What's the seal doing? Oh my God! 11 free pizzas. Is this the right place? Who wants Regina Margherita? Get in here. - Password? - Hungry. Arm. And to make it real, we threw the first "Starving Party." The idea: gather all the bloggers, share our experiences IRL. I'm Romane77. You do data entry, right? Exactly. My thesis needs printing. Can you help? Sure. For when? Monday. Next week. How about Wednesday? Wednesday, then. All done. Pleased? Yes. Thanks for the bar. Between this and "Poverty Line Fridays," I'll be branded a leftist bar. Not yet. Try lowering your prices. Some nerve! When I saw us all there together, I knew we were a force, no matter what they say. So if that's 2% of the GDP... What follows? Hold on. Cynthia, what follows from what I just said? Can you get off her please? Recess. Good. Have a nice recess too. I'm fine, thanks. Oh, Zoe! Do you realize how crazy it is? I'm finally part of something. A movement! More than 500,000 visits! Half a million! People. Real people. It's incredible. Now we're empowered. We're fighting back. Even my brother? Even your brother! Obviously. It feels great to do something practical. We're in it together. Hey all. It's Gael. I had an idea today. What if everyone working in the service sector at shops, restaurants... announced their degree. Cool, right? Great. Hello, I study design. Do you have a loyalty card? No. Excuse me, Miss? I'm a certified social worker. How can I help you? That's it, basically. It's great. Well, I'm off to bed. Already? I work tomorrow. I get up at 6. But please stay. Goodnight. - 'Night, honey. - Yeah, later. What's her problem? You know her, she's a complainer. How's my son? You see him more than I do. Not that often lately. He's busy with his new TV internship. Does he like it? Apparently it's not the apex of journalism. You have to start somewhere. Speaking of which, can I show you something? Sure. Hold on. OK, I... Know it? Oh my! At first I was on Tinder. But the men my age were either weird, ugly or both. So at least here, you know what you get. But... Have you thought about going out? Like to a real bar... With real people? I'm a divorcee with two kids, up to here in debt. So I'm a tough sell. I can imagine. Last week I slept with a very young man. 23 years old. Look. - Wow! - See? Even you dig him. His body.... so firm. And not just his body! Catch my drift? - I get it. - Firm! I get it. An erection like that, I haven't seen since the 20th century. Oh, hey. Can you help me sort coupons? Everyone bailed and there's tons... Not tonight. You OK? You look down. Is it work? No. What's up? Tell me. It's over with In√®s. From the bar? Yeah. Hold on. I have the solution. Come on. I won't bite. Why do girls watch happy movies when they're sad? I don't get it. They remind us happiness exists. You know it's a fiction written by someone. Yeah, but fiction... What do you think it's based on? I dream of a guy doing that for me. I can't give up hope. So girls declare their love? Well, yeah. Smile for me. You're the smile. Smile. A real one. Get your shitty paper! Get your shitty paper! Get your shitty paper! Shitty paper! Take it! Fuck! Shitty paper? Maybe it was me, but the house screamed "pathetic." To get us in shape, here's the plan: Lucas. Next week, you dumpster dive. Eva and David. You go thrifting on Friday. Me and Chris will make a coupon book. Thrift stores and tag sales will be listed here. We need bargains. This... Is for Jon and Arthur. Where are they? I dunno. How about a movie? No, not tonight. I've got work. - Hello. - Thanks. - Wanna blow me? - No, you blow. Can I hang my balls on your tree? - Are you serious? - I was good this year, Santa! Slut. Who are we waiting for? - For Zoe. - What's the big news? - There she is. - What's going on? I have an announcement to make. I found a job. Awesome! Great! In Qatar. You're kidding. What? In Qatar? You're a black dyke going to Qatar? I know, it's weird. Not weird. Suicidal. It's fundamentalist! I know it's not a model of democracy. Not really, no. Just imagining sex is a crime. You're exaggerating, Zoe. Maybe. But it's a real job! No garters or thongs. That's for sure. So what's the job? I'll be Middle East director for a French start-up. Sweet! It's exciting as hell. Sweet. Terrific. How about congratulating me? 3 years, V√©ronique. 3 years I've let you talk down to me! I'm your coworker, not your employee. I let you mistreat me! I would've loved to staple-gun your face. Have you seen V√©ronique? V√©ronique? What's wrong? I'm old. No. You're not old. Yes, I am. I'm old and washed-up. They let me go. Who's "they"? The management. They want to attract a new clientele. They want younger sales reps, like you. Shit. I'm sorry. Thanks. You're sweet. You had something to tell me? Nothing important. Mom? What are you doing here? I live here. Wait. Isabelle? You know her? The site's to blame. What site, Mom? Right, because... The fa√ßade looked familiar but with the booze.... I assure you, I had no idea. Plus you don't... You don't look alike. I mean, you do, but it's not... I swear I didn't know. This is a joke. It looks bad, but they didn't know. Right? Of course not. I mean, it's no big deal. You find this funny? Don't push me! Kitten! Some kitten! Are you crazy? Grow up, guys! What was that? Deodorant. High-endurance, too. Hey, everyone. Well... You guys are in high spirits! What's there to be happy about? There's worse than being 20, right? Worse than what? We have at least 60 more years of this. If we don't die in a terrorist attack first. Hey, drama queen. Millions are homeless. Refugees who... die trying to come here for even a fraction of what you have. So? We should consider ourselves fortunate? No, but you should put things in perspective. Great advice. Seriously, what am I going to do? Like I said, you could stay in school another year. Why? To get a useless degree from crusty old profs? So it's the professors' fault? No, but if education kept pace, we wouldn't be here. You're provoking me. Don't you ever take responsibility? What's your problem, teach? - Sorry? - You heard. My problem's your complaining. Other people exist. Everyone has problems, even me. Oh yeah, such as? If you listened, you'd know. I go to school every morning with a knot in my stomach. And when I try to tell you, you're so self-involved you can't even listen. At least you have a stable job. What do I have? Fuck you, Zoe. Yeah, get lost! Got a euro by any chance? No, sorry. A euro is nothing. Look at your clothes. What about them? Dressing well doesn't make me rich. Fine. Whatever. Hello. Thanks. Have a good one. Get your Choco-Quick! Choco-Quick. Who wants Choco-Quick? I liked the concept, but now... Now, what? It's not filling my bar. Must be the bad weather. Yeah, must be. My son showed me your internet thing. Your blog or whatever... What's your goal? What do you mean? What are you trying to achieve? A reaction from the government? A pay hike? A youth minimum wage? It's great to fight for a cause, but at some point the battle has to end or the troops lose morale. You're right. Time for Phase 2. This place has more security than Gitmo. Since Charlie Hebdo, yeah. What can I do for you? No, what can I do for you? Since you have no lunch break... If you can't go to the shawarma, it comes to you. You rock! I haven't eaten since... Last night, I think. Thanks. Sorry, I've been distant since the fight. I was mad, but not at you. Water under the bridge. So this is where you work? Can you show me? It's simple. Look. My job is to follow the press feed. And summarize the story. Here, in this box. You have to be fast. To beat out the other networks. I'm such a klutz. It's OK. Zoe, fuck! Sorry. I'm such a spaz. Go get cleaned up. Be right back. Watch the feed, OK? No problem. Mass exploitation of young people What are you doing? You'll get me fired! It's no big deal. It's for the movement. What movement? Lucas! What's with the ticker? And who's she? It was a mistake. A copy and paste... A mistake, sure. Julien? Replace Lucas. In my office, now. Right now! I want you gone when I get back. - Sorry! - You're so selfish. Your altruism is just an act! People over 40 aren't to blame for your life not having meaning. Get out. Scram! Jon, Arthur! You forgot the tag sale. What the fuck? Where's the Charter? What'd your boss say? I got fired. Sit down, Zoe. C'mon, an intervention? Because of Lucas' job? - It's more general. - How so? You've lost it. We can't anymore. Nor do we want to. It was fine at first. It even felt good to fight back. But you went too far. Way too far. Like to another dimension. We're tired of coupons, poster board, stress. We have enough at work. And you really screwed Lucas over. Jon. Shut up. I goofed, sorry. But how could I know? Did you think I'd get promoted? - We miss the old Zoe. - Who? You're cowards. The struggle means nothing to you. You have no stamina. Do you hear what you're saying? We're not at war! Maybe not you! - Meaning? - You know, Mr. Banker. Come back to earth, Zoe! It's not about politics. The problem is you. We've tried to tell you. You've flipped. You're so hyper it's killing you, and us. Know what? I'll just split then! Here. Good, keep getting screwed by the system! She doesn't get it. Marc. She's been smoking up in front of Paul! I'll tell her. Thanks for the... Honey, I know things have been hard. I want you to know it won't last. Not at all. Someday you'll have a flat and a job. You'll have a life. Yeah. Someday in 35 years. Do you realize I was 25 when I had you? Barely older than you are now. Can you imagine? And let me tell you, having kids changes your outlook. You stop seeing things in black-and-white. You realize that... there are greys. And that's when grown-ups start dismantling the welfare state they benefited from. Right? That's exactly the kind of certainty that makes me miss seeing things in black-and-white like you. But I assure you, the more complicated you realize things are, the simpler they get. I swear. Hang in there. Doesn't sound very appealing. Because you don't see the nuances. Well... your nuances, that is. I was wondering... would you let me smoke your marijuana? What? It's one thing you miss, getting older. Go ahead. Enjoy. Here goes. You smoke like an Indian. What do you expect? It's been a while. A few weeks later, I discovered the joys of fast food. It wasn't what I'd studied for, but at least, with a real job, I could find my dream hovel. It was hardly luxurious. My room's bigger! But it was better than Dad's sofa. Needs a little dusting, but it's a nice starter place. It's a great opportunity. Thank you. Here. Enjoy your meal. You work until 10. Let's go, back to work. Just... let me explain. I didn't want to tell you... But... There's a problem. Amine... puts the cheese on the burgers, instead of underneath. I wanted to talk to him directly... and not make a stink, but you got here and... Amine. Is that true? You put the cheese on last? What was your training period for? That's low, Zoe. Sorry. I'll handle it. Back to work. So, Amine... Let's see your burgers. Zoe? I saw you this afternoon. How about a drink? I'd love to talk. "Hieroglyph." Triple word score! Wasn't this a bocce-ball bar? Yeah. But scrabble is the new retro. The pub is nice too, and the beer's cheaper. You've changed. So? Nothing. It's good. What's your deal? Why'd you show up? I dunno what got into me. Marynn was a mistake. No shit. We were good together. We had a nice, quiet life. So much joy scared me. You wanted to bone a new girl, period. You're always on my mind. 8 months and not an apology. I didn't know what I wanted. Now I do. I miss you, my love. So much. I want to be with you. In Japan. Like the two of us planned. I want you so bad. Seriously? It was new. So what? I'll buy you another. I want you so bad. Sorry, I can't. It stops here. What? Is it your period? No, you don't understand. - Then come. - I can't... Anymore. It's not the life I want. With you or anyone. In Japan or elsewhere. Our dream wasn't mine and I've just realized that. I need to live free, beholden to no one. Beholden for what to whom? What are you talking about? I need purpose. We need to take action, and I don't want to leave France. The grass isn't always greener. It's not too late to be proactive, and take action. Nice speech, you sound like a child. Keep it. It's retro now, too. There. So torture was quite common in the late Middle Ages. Very common. But the most popular method was this one: mutilation. Cutting off hands. Noam? Are you listening? What's going on? What on earth? Get lost? Yes. In my stupidity. I'm sorry, Maud. I understand what you were saying. I only thought about myself. I was a bad friend and a bad person. So I'm supposed to just forgive you? I want an update. To know how you are. And... Yeah? I brought you nuggets. With dipping sauce? Who do you think I am? You're lucky I love you since preschool. But that won't cut it. Want to go thrifting? Now you're talking. I missed you. I did too. Like crazy. Hey. Guys, it's Zoe. - Can I come in? - Uh, yeah... Hey. What's up? What are you doing here? I brought you this. What is it? Nothing much, but... I figured you'd enjoy it. Thanks. Holy shit! It works for Big Macs! How'd you get these? I work at McDonald's. For real? I'm about to be made manager. Where are you living? A studio, nearby. By yourself? Without anyone's balls to bust? Yeah. By myself. I came to apologize. I'm really sorry. I know I acted like a dick. We're not angry. Not anymore. Thanks. Is Lucas here? In his room. Go ahead. Knock first. You never know if... So you're leaving? No. It's a Feng Shui arrangement. Your sister wouldn't say... Where you headed? Australia. For a long time? I didn't get a return ticket. I came to apologize. To all of you. I miss you guys. You're forgiven. You know, I miss you the most. Why are you leaving? I have nothing here. Because you got fired? I'm sorry. It's not that, it's... It's complicated. I don't see a future here. There was a period when... I thought you and I... So did I. But it didn't happen. We weren't synchronized. It didn't happen. That's life. Look out! - Did you do that... thing? - I'm sorry. Hey. Well, I know these things take time. But call me and we'll grab a beer. Totally. We have an envelope for you too. No way! Marriage isn't too bourgeois for you? When did you get engaged? Right before you left. And we thought, since you're a good writer, maybe you could make a speech? Really? I'm a good writer? Yeah. But maybe you could avoid politics? We're doomed, capitalism, etc. Just focus on love. I promise. Only love. Great. Congratulations! This is nuts. What are they doing? Where are they? I should've gotten her ready. She needed me. Well, hello there. - Where's Lucas? - He has a plane in 4 hours. - Did he say goodbye? - Yes. I thought I was late. What a surprise! - You're stunning. - Thanks. - You're back! - How could I miss this? How's Qatar? It's about time! You could've taken a real cab. She's marrying him? I mean, really. My princess. - 5 stars for you. - Kudos. Take care, lovebirds. My beautiful Princess. - And the Prince? - What Prince? Zoe? You're on. When I first met David and Eva, I thought it was over. Shouting that loud could only mean a breakup. But after living with them a while, I realized that, on the contrary, it was their love. And to be honest, I concluded maybe we should all love that way. When you think about it, an argument in a couple is only a way of... correcting course, leaving things open, testing oneself by testing each other, and making up. We heard them making up, that's for sure. They only argue to love each other more afterwards. But that's not all. David and Eva, your concept of love is perfect. You're not marrying for appearances, society or status. You're marrying for love. And because you know exactly what that love consists of. And tonight, you just want to remind us all that it exists. To you both. To David and Eva. - I'm going home. - No! It's 4 a.m. You're wasted. No! What's wrong with you? Later, guys. Stay! We haven't danced enough. I'm exhausted. When do you leave? Next week. Stay! No, sorry. Shit! Damn it. It's you. No, my hologram. I couldn't leave without saying... Every day since we ran into each other again I've thought of you. If you'll give me a chance I'm here. And... What about Australia? You're my Australia. Actually, Zoe... I really, really... really want to eat your pussy. See? It works. Jon probably used it on your mom. 3 months went by. I'm not saying all my problems vanished. But at least I had company. What are you doing? I was watching porn. For real. I'm looking for a job. Holy shit. Come look! I haven't logged on in months. Wow! Unbelievable! - There are so many! - Great. Awesome. Hey Gen Starving. It's been a while, but I'm back with an update. I've been thinking about what's around me. About social inequality and young people's aspirations. Our lack of self-confidence holds us back. We need to know you're waiting for us. Not in ambush, but with open arms. And yet, as time goes by, I realize defending our own interests isn't enough. If we want to change things... We have to think bigger. But we have to think together. I still dream of a world without millennials. But I've realized we're not the only invisible ones. Today I imagine a world without the exploited. A world without underpaid construction workers, without women cleaning offices at 5 a.m. without all the invisible cogs in the machine of those who profit. Who knows, maybe someday, united by our anger, by our movement, we'll decide to leave, to disappear. So they realize we make it all run. "It's normal, you're young." See the news? No, why? Look, quick! Mind turning it up? We don't know who's behind this walk-out. The idea appeared online before receiving support from unions and associations. The strike is September 18th... "Make the invisible visible" is their rallying cry. Closed for invisibility Look at us Invisible We exist! Closed for invisibility Look at us Invisible Solidarity Thanks for calling. What's going on? All good, Chris. Same old. Except for this. Hey Paris, how are you? That's crazy, what's happening? Everyone's gone! Crazy. You're scaring me. It's nuts. I feel so free. Like I could do anything. Totally! Let's get naked. You're mental. Jon's got problems. What next? We keep fighting. And never give up! I'm a law student. Finishing up my Master's. The first thing is that in France it's impossible to be a good student and pay rent. The day I started job hunting I realized that even after internships, finding a first job was really hard. Nobody takes the risk to hire you, if you have no experience. We're a generation that's tired and disillusioned, because after getting a job, after the marathon of interviews, we don't get much respect. My name's Christelle, I'm 21 and I'm tired. It takes endurance. You can't give up. Because one day if you stick with it you'll do something incredible, and they'll realize you're worth something. I want to turn my anger into something positive. To focus this anger... and turn it into hope, into strength, as a way of saying the fight's not over. Hope's not a tactic, but revolutions are built on it. I think if we remain docile things won't change. Everything depends on you. Listening to others won't help. Listen to yourself and what you want to do. What excites you? What makes you happy?
