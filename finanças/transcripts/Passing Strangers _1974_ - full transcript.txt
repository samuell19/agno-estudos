[funky electronic music] [projector noise] - Outside line please, Carolyn. - Tom's number again? - Uh-huh. His ad just came out in the Barb. - Tom is running an ad? - Yep, uh-huh. A sex ad. Although it's not quite the usual kind. - Artie, I'll get you his number. You send the paper down here when you through reading it. I'd love to read it. [dial tone] [dialing] [phone ringing] - Hello, Tom. - Yes, this is Tom. - Well, Tom, it's out. - Oh, Artie. What's out? - Your ad. I just finished reading it. Where did you ever come up with the idea for it? I didn't know you wrote poetry. - Well, Artie. I don't. I copied it out of a book of poems that I have in my room. I tried to write a regular ad but I couldn't come up with anything, except the usual Barb trip. You know, gay, white, male, 28 years old, 6 foot 3, 160 pounds, blond hair, blue eyes, seeks... - Seeks what? - I drew a blank. So, I sent in that poem by Walt Whitman in instead. Are you at the theater? - Uh-huh. - How's porno heaven? - It's about the same Tom. Two new flicks off from L.A. Washed out colors, shitty prints, lousy soundtracks. The house is about half full. You figure it. - Yeah. What are the films about this week? - Well, one supposed to take place in Paris, but it's the usual, boy meets girl. Boy fucks girl. Girl does everybody in town. There's a beautiful dude in the second feature and the Paris one has a good fucking scene in it near the end. They're just about par for the course. Were you late for work this morning? - Artie, these days, I've been late for work just about every morning. I went to the bar last night and stayed 'til last call. Then I cruised Polk Street, and got home by 3:30 a.m. alone. I was half asleep on the bus this morning. I've been stumbling around the office coasting until lunchtime. Listen, Artie. What did you think of the ad? I mean if, if you didn't know me at all, would you answer it? - Well, I like the last part, you know, where it says, "I wake at night alone. I do not doubt, we shall meet again.” Heavy shit, but, no, I wouldn't answer it, Tom. Poetry is not my style. - Well, I hope somebody answers it. - Tom, you know who will answer your ad? - Dear Box1154, My name is Robert. I'm 18 years old. I've never answered an ad in the Barb before. But yours seem so different from the others in the paper that I thought I'd write to you. It's been very difficult for me to enter the gay world. I live with my parents and I go to school down by Aquatic Park. I don't like school that much. It's a hassle. Being new to the gay scene is scary. Even writing this letter is weird. I don't know what to write. I've thrown away six tries so far. I'm going to mail this one no matter how bad it is. I wish you had put your name along with your post office box number, it would have made answering easier. I'm into movies, especially old ones. I like music and I have a pretty good collection of records. I don't know how to end this letter. I'm wondering about what you're like, what your life is like. Right now, things for me are pretty heavy. I guess that's why I'm answering your ad. I wish I could put down on paper what I'm feeling. Sincerely, Robert. P.S. My address is 2468B Day Street San Francisco. If you answer, don't put your name and return address on the outside of the envelope. My parents might ask who you are. [instrumental piano music] [projector noise] [sleazy electronic music] [TV sounds] - KDUX San Francisco in cooperation with the Worthington Foundation presents Silent Screen Classics, films from Hollywood's Golden Era. Tonight, D.W. Griffith's Broken Blossoms, starring Lillian Gish and Richard Barthelmess. Released in 1919, Broken Blossoms, marked Griffith's return to the simple melodrama after the commercial failure of his masterwork, Intolerance. Broken Blossoms is a story of the doomed relationship between an Oriental man and a White girl filmed in 19 days. [Broken Blossoms playing on TV] - Dear Robert, thanks for answering my ad. I got your letter yesterday at the post office. I'm, I hardly know where to begin. First, I didn't write that ad by myself. I copied it out of a book because, well, I'm not a very good writer and it was hard to think of words to describe my scene these days. I hope you understand. You asked about me in your letter. I'm 28 years old. I've lived in San Francisco for about 5 years. I was born in New York City. I work at the telephone company in an office downtown. It's a job. At night, I go ask the bars. The Stud is my favorite place. On weekends, I usually the windup with the baths. I've been going there a lot lately. I like the baths because I can be close to a man without all the hassles and introductions and heavy bar cruising. Things that the baths don't last too long. But, I've met some good folks there. My friend, Artie, says that sex is my primary interest in life. I don't know. But then again, he may be right because on Sunday, unless it's raining very hard, I'm out cruising. On Polk Street. [instrumental ragtime music] - You said in your letter, Robert, that it's hard for you to enter the gay scene. I started on the street when I was really young. I'd see some man who turned me on. I'd look and wish we could just go somewhere and go to bed. Finally, a guy came over and talked and said hello, and that was it. Some of my friends think cruising the streets is trashy but, I still dig it. It's out in the open and I can always back out if I change my mind. I live close enough to Polk Street to walk home with whoever I meet. And, just have good time. If any of this stuff makes sense, write back. I'd like to get to know you better. Love, Tom. P.S. If you answer, you don't have to write to Box 1154. I live at 3098 California Street. Zip, 94115.

Well, I've written three more to Robert since I saw you last. - What's he like? I know, you told me, he's 18, but what else? - Well, I think he's really neat. I mean, he sounds a bit lonely, but I can relate to that. He doesn't like school too much. He seems sincere. I'd like to meet him soon. - Did you write that in your last letter? - No. Well, let's see. I just mailed the last one yesterday. I wrote about my day and I asked him to send me his picture. - What? - Well, I just asked him to send me a photograph of himself so I could see what he looks like. - Do you think that was an okay thing to ask for? - What do you mean? - I don't know. It could sound freaky. Is it that important? I mean, - how he looks? - Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is. [eerie instrumental music] [discordant instrumental music] [wind blowing] [instrumental music] [trolley noises] - Dear Tom, it's nighttime. I'm sitting in my room writing this and feeling sorry for myself. I guess I'm digging it. I've been thinking about what you wrote in your last letter about getting together on Saturday, June 23rd. I'm pretty scared to actually meet you, scared that you might not like me or that all the feelings in me might not come out. I want to love someone but I've never gotten outside my head about it. Besides, I'm getting used to writing to you. It's funny, you know, more about me than anybody else and we've never really met. I don't understand you too well. You wrote that you have friends and that you've had lovers, and yet you said you're not at all that happy. That blows my mind. Right now, I wish there was someone to hold on to. Anyone. School is a continuing drag. I hate P. E. class. I keep wondering if anybody can tell I'm gay just by looking at me. I feel skinny and weird. In the showers, I freak out trying not to get an erection. It's a bummer. I hope I'm not boring you with all this, but I'm lonely and I'm getting tired of being lonely, which is worse. I don't know. At school, I always get 70 in English. My teacher says, I don't write enough on my assignments. I can never think of what to say. So I just sit there and hand in whatever comes to mind. But writing to you is different. I can get some of it out on paper at least. I guess it's because you're not here in my room looking at me. Your friend, Robert. P.S. About Saturday, I'm sorta freaked out. But I'll meet you near the point at Land's End by 10 o'clock. I hope you'll be there.
