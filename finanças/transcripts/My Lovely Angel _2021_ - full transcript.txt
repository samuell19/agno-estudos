Gosh, she's always late. These so-called artists have no respect for their agent. Put that damn cigarettes out! You're stinking up the car. Why are you taking it out on us? Not again. What's your problem? What has he got to whine on us when his office is a van! What made him snap this time? Who knows. Perhaps she has her period again. Well, it's true. She's always causing so much trouble. I'm so sick of her. Aren't we? Ji-young! You're so dead. Hello...? Is she really dead? We checked the CCTV foortage and there was nothing out of ordinary. It seems that she slipped and fell and died during the administration of first aid. These are her belongings. Would you be able to reach her family? According to the resident registration card, she only has a seven-year-old daughter. Have you heard from anyone yet? Nope. Not even a single phone call when they know she's dead? Why are you getting mad at me? Look, it's just you. 'Cheap jerk' Damn... she should have paid me back before she died. Hello? Anybody home? This place is a pigsty. Oh, I see. Hi, you must be Ji-young's daughter. I'm your mom's friend. Aren't you going to say hello? Damn little brat... Where the hell are they? Hey, where are your mom's jewelrys? You know those shiny ones? Your mom asked me to get them for her. Hey! What the...! What's wrong with you? Can't you see me? Hello? Hello? Is this Ji-young's husband? Who is this? Me? I'm her colleague. Are you Ji-young's husband? We split up a long time ago. What a jerk! Hello, wait, don't hang up. There's something wrong with your kid. She has nothing to do with me now. What? Nothing to do with his own kid just because they're divorced? What a scumbag! What? What is it? What? What is it? Be quiet, shh! Quiet! Ouch! Ji-young, Ji-young! We need to talk! Aren't you there? Ji-young! I can hear you! Yes, what is it? See! I knew someone was home. What's wrong with you people? Hey! Hey!! What's all the mess? Who are you? You can't just barge into other people's homes. Don't you know who I am? Ji-young had such a hard time. Do you have any idea how hard it is for a woman to raise a child by herself? Let alone a child like hers. And it's not like she made a baby by herself. How could anyone take off like that just because the kid isn't normal? You can't just cheat, run away and pretend the kid doesn't exist. Right? Right. Where is Ji-young? Well... She... You know how young people these days are... Since I know her situation, I lowered the rent below the market price, but look at this mess! Actually I'm not her... I thought you came back to your senses. But you're still no good. What do you mean I'm no good? How could you guys be so irresponsible? You've been avoiding my calls and texts since the lease is almost expired. You may think you can slither your way into another two-year lease, but no way. You need to pay more rent or move out. How much is the rent on this place? It's $80,000. And you won't find a place like this in this neighborhood with that money. Call your wife right now and talk to her about it. You need to make a decision. Look at this place! I would have just kicked you out if I didn't have a good heart. Oh, Eun-hae... That poor thing... Be good! Ok?! Ma'am, please... I'm so sorry to hear that. How could something like this happen? I'm so sorry. I should have informed you. No, don't worry about it. By the way, where will you go? She's going to live with her grandparents in the country. I can't work and raise her all by myself. Ji-young managed to work and look after her on her own. Yes. I'm usually at the Residents' Committee Office. Call me if you need anything. Thank you. I really appreciate it. Yeah, take care. Be strong! Alright? Keep in touch! (Rental Agreement) $80,000! Jae-sik, wait! What? I'm busy! You can't go in there! You should have paid your rent. Look... Can you tell him to give me just one more month? I had a lot of things to take care of. It's not just this month. I know you lost money because of the tip I gave you and that's why I'm working my ass off to cover up for you. But you're going to get me fired for that. One of my employees just died. I have to give her a funeral at least! There's always someone dead in your company. I'm serious. It's true this time! No one actually died until now. But this time, she's really dead. I can't believe how cold and insensitive you are. Gosh, how could you... I'm off! Do you miss your mom? She is just like her mom blowing people off. Hey. Say daddy. Daddy...! Da... ddy! Say daddy! Dad! We have to look like a father and a daughter for at least a month. Hey. How do you get the kids to like you? Kids? What kids? Wait, a single mom? Are you dating a single mom? A mom? How old is the kid? I don't know. About 7...? Huh? 7.. Give it up. A 7-year-old already knows everything. They know what's pretty and expensive. There's no way you can pull it off. Just stay single for the rest of your life. Here. Hey. So the bread is the problem. I should get rid of all the bread. Wait, wait. Eat this. Hey! Hey! You can't spill food like that. What the hell does she want? Fine, have it your way. Such a little brat... What should I do with her? Yup, you do your thing and I do mine. Okay? What? I thought you didn't want it. Fine. Eat it. It's all yours. Damn... Hey! What are you doing? I'm eating lunch. Were you able to come up with the money? Not yet. I told you about that tip, didn't I? - That tip? - Yeah. What's the theme? Why do you want to know? You don't even have the money. I told you I'm going to come up with the money real soon. - Yeah? - Yeah. You've got to hurry for this one. Whether it's $5,000 or $50,000, whoever makes the bet first is going to win tenfolds. Hello, are you listening? Jae-sik? - Crap! - Hello? Jae-sik? What the... This is definitely a case of an occupational accident. I've got to pull this off and start everything over. (Deceased spouse's inheritance in common-law marriage) This looks like a bad case of child abuse. That lady... She is as busy as me. What now? What gets on your radar again? Hello, how are you? It's been ages. Oh, right! I have to make a quick call. Yes, ma'am. Are you home? No, I'm out taking care of some things. Oh, you're out? A realtor is coming over to check out the place so I need to clean it up. A realtor? Yes, can you give me the PIN code for the door lock? Sure. No problem. Crap! Get up! Get up! It's an emergency! Get up! Hey! Get up! Let's get changed first! Hey, get up! Quick! Let's get changed! Yeah, this looks good. I'm just trying to make you look pretty. Let's get rid of this. Let's get into something clean. Eun-hae, please. Here... Feel this... Eun-hae... Ouch! Fine! Suit yourself! The whole world is against me. There is no one on my side. I'm doomed. Oh, you're here early. I thought you were out. Oh, I rushed back home when I heard you were coming. You must have been in a big hurry. Come on. Let's get down to work. We're all busy people. What is this smell? - You know how single dads are. - Oh, excuse me. - Let me... - That's okay. Just look at her. I know what you're going through. But you've got to pull yourself together. Things are different nowadays. This is child abuse and neglect. Child abuse? What child abuse? Yes, you're right. It's just that I've been really... Save it. Just give her a bath or something. - What? - Give her a bath! Eun-hae... Can she hear him? Didn't you say she can't see nor hear? But he's her dad. There must be some kind of connection between them. Her mom's news must have devastated her. How would she know what happened to her mom? Shh! Be quiet! Why is this here? We can't wash this. So he's her biological dad? Yeah, I heard they were not properly married though. Did they at least register their marriage? What if he's just pretending to be her dad for disability allowance? Oh, like that jerk in “60 Minutes” He should burn in hell! I know. Those people abuse the kids and... Oh, I knew it. I'm so sorry. I was just... You've never given her a bath, have you? Are you okay? Oh, my! Look at this! It's okay. It's okay. Here you go, alright. Everything is fine, it's all fine. It's alright, good job! Where do you think you're going? Watch and learn. You'll have to wash her now that her mom's not around anymore. It's okay, it's okay. Eun-hae, I had a really long day. I want to cry, too. Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay? Hey! Hey! You're burning hot! Hey, this really stinks. Let's just leave it here. Hey! Give it to me! Now! Ouch! Oh, that hurts. Fine, take it! (Vision Disability Class) Do... That's okay. Let's try one more time. Do... - Stop it! Please.. - Mi... Do you remember what I said we'd do in our last class today? Let's imagine... and learn... - I'm sorry. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. You have to open your mouth wider.. But it goes narrower. Why? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Let's leave the class, Eun-hae. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (Counseling room) No deaf-blindness? No, deaf-blindness is not on the national disability category. You fall under either vision disability or hearing disability to take classes. Eun-hae is registered as visually impaired so she can take classes for... You saw how she was in class. I'm sorry. There aren't special classes for deaf-blindness but we could let her take classes for hearing impaired with her regular classes. But she can't see the sign language or hear the teacher. Oh... yes. Right. That's true. Yeah, if she learns to read... Let's start with 'dad'. Dad, just learning 'Dad' will be a big help for me. Let's start with the easiest alphabet. Yes, the round one. That's 'D'. Next is... Here, it's 'A'. Feel it. 'D', can you find 'D'? No, that's not it. That one, that's it... Oh, good job! Great! There! Let's put the 'D' and this together. It's 'A'. 'A' of 'Da' Right, 'D' and... try again. Put the 'D' with 'A'. You're a genius. Now all you have to do is to add another 'D'. Right, one more 'D'. The round, the easiest one. Now, on my palm. Right, one more! Good job! Put them together. 'D' 'A' 'D'. With 'D' on both sides like this. And it's 'Dad'. No, not 'Dab', it's 'Dad'. No, no. Let's try one more time. 'Dad'... Come on, focus. 'Dad'. No, no. Snack after study. Wait, wait. We must study first. Hey! Yeah, of course you like bread more than dad. Who is it? Is this Ms. Lee Ji-young's residence? Yes, that's right. We're from the court. We're here to seize tangible movables. What is your relationship with Ms. Lee? We were in common-law marriage. Excuse me! Would the rent deposit get seized, too? Yes, of course. That's my laptop. You said she was your wife. Nothing seems to work out for me. Why isn't Sun-young here yet? She's been acting a little strange lately. Don't tell him. I heard that she's working with some other agent. Who? I don't know. I said not to tell him. But she doesn't come. Yes, sir. I've been waiting for your call. When shall I come by your office? Oh, you can't call it off now... But it was that customer who started the whole thing. Freaking scumbag! (Mr. Jo) Yes, Mr. Jo. This is Park Jae-sik. Oh, yes. How are you? I'm good. How about you? Can you give me some work? Things are so tough these days. Didn't you hear from Mr. Yang? He said he was taking over. You mean Yang Cheol-jin? Hey! Cheol-jin! You jerk! How could you do this to me? Hey. Bro, sit down. Let's sit down and talk. Hey, serve him a cup of tea. Yes, sir. Your credit is really bad, so I didn't have any other choice but to take your business as security. Even so! How could you do this to me? After all the things I have done for you. Of course I know what you've done for me. Then how could you do this to me? You've got to be brutal to survive in this world. You won't get anywhere with the way you handle stuff. So just come and work for me. What the hell did you say? You won't ever save up enough money like this. For years, you've been talking about opening a diner. Diner my ass. Wake up and smell the coffee. Is it because you don't have a family to support? You're still so immature. Look, Mr. Park. I don't expect you to be a real man but you've got to grow up sometime. - Hey, guys. - Yes, sir. Take a good look at him. If you waste your life away, you'll be like him in a decade. Understand? Yes, sir. We'll keep it in mind. - I'm gonna go. - Where will you go? I'm going home. I'm not gonna do it with you. - Let go off me! - Okay, okay. Where are you going? Wait! Okay, okay. - Gosh I hate you. - Come on, just an hour is enough! You scumbag! You filthy jerk! You're pimping my employee! - You worthless trash! - Jae-sik! Stop it! I'm going to kill him. - Stop it! - Let go! - Stop it! - Let go! Stop it! Are you okay? I'm sorry. Go away! Are you okay? Go! (Your credit card has been suspended) (due to unpaid invoices) (Jeong-eup aunt) ($5,000 would be good?) (Thank you, I'll pay back soon.) She had an aunt in Jeong-eup? $15,000... and... she lent her aunt more than $30,000. That's a lot of money. Aunt... $30,000... I should have killed that jackass. There are too many bad guys in this world, don't you think? (Help Find This Person!) Excuse, I'm looking for her... Finding her would be the right thing to do, right? Thank you. I'm looking for this lady... She's this woman's aunt. I'm looking for this lady... She's this woman's aunt. She cultivates watermelons... She's not here. Hey! Here! Come here! Come here! You must not have eaten searching for that person. Yes, I have to find her as soon as possible. It might take days. Do you have a place to stay? Of course... not. - Yeah? Are you done eating? - Yes. Thank you so much. Here, drink it up. Do you want me to see if you can sleep at the community center? - Stay the night? - Yeah. What are you doing? Are you going to stay out here all day? Oh, so sleepy... Come here! Hurry! Are you sure this is safe? Here, take this. These are really good fertilized eggs. You can eat them raw and they still taste good. Help yourself! Good night! Come over and have breakfast in the morning. Yeah, yeah. What kind of fool does he take me for? He should pay for all the work he made me do today. Geez, I'm beat. Wow, I heard you beat Cheol-jin's ass. Well, I just gave him a little warning. So you're going to lay low for a while? Lay low? Why would I lay low? I'm out of town on business to settle some overdue account. Oh, that aunt you were talking about? I came all this way to Jeong-eup but she's nowhere to be found. I can sort everything out if I just find her. What the...! What's wrong with you? It's disgusting! - Jae-sik? What's disgusting? - What? I wasn't talking to you. Go on. - So that aunt lady... - Jeez! - Hold on. - Hello? - Hello? - Yeah, I'm listening. Are you thirsty? There's not even a damn store in this crappy town... Don't swallow the seeds. Here. Spit them out like this. No, not like that! Oh, yeah? Right. This is a watermelon. Feel it. It's smooth out, and juicy inside. Watermelon! W-A-T-E-R M-E-L-O-N Try it out. W-A-T-E-R M-E-L-O-N Good job! Hey! Don't you have anything to say to me? Huh? What would I have to say to you? You stole something, didn't you? Did you steal the watermelon? I'm so sorry. There was no water and she was so thirsty. I was also reminded of childhood, growing up in a farm... It's still theft. You're a father so you must know that those watermelons are like children to the growers. I'm sorry. That never crossed my mind. And for your information, I'm not her father. You're not? You shouldn't cause damage to other people's crops all the more when you need town's people's help to find someone. Right? Yes, you're absolutely right. So you agree to both theft and property damage? Property damage? Oh, I wouldn't say... There's nothing I can do about those watermelons... What do you think I should do? More? Don't put anymore. Stop whining! It's not that heavy. I'm not saying it's heavy. It's just that it sways. - Be careful. - It's not that easy. Gosh, hold it harder! Thank God! They're not broken. They're not broken. Yeah, they're not broken... Not broken at all... Thank God... They are all fine! What? We can't go out in the rain. Just go to sleep. I told you we can't go out! Go to sleep! So damn stubborn. Where do you want to go in this rain? Fine! You'll learn your lesson when you get soaked wet in rain. Hey stop, that's dirty. Right. Feel it. They're the same. Good job! Try again. Just a minute! Let's eat. Thank you, sir. Help yourself. Aunt, I don't want to eat. Come on, eat. There you go. Aunt! Me, me! Don't be a picky eater. Oh, not again! Don't do that! It's yucky! She must like you a lot. What do you mean? My mother suffered from dementia in her final years. She used to spit out the food that she liked and gave it to me. She wanted to feed it to the person she loved. Such a lovely girl. She's not even her aunt. I knew something wasn't right. That's probably not even that wench's real name. She's a quite well-known con artist in the field. She would borrow money saying she needs it for her watermelon farm, her pumpkin farm and then takes off. I heard she took off with tens and thousands of dollars. She's a total scammer. Jae-sik? Are you there? Sir! What are you doing? Sir... Oh, hello, how have you been? It's good to see you! Are you looking for something? It's nothing. I just have something to ask you. What's the pay for the day labor here? It's about $80 a day. Should I find you some work? Is there much work? Yeah, finding work is no problem. Finding workers is the problem. Oh, yeah, and the guest cottage you mentioned before... Can we stay there? - Jae-sik? - Yes. Thank you. What is that? They're chicks. They are for her. Thank you. Chick! It's a chick. It's alright. Easy... That's right. It is a chick. Shalll we spell it? C-H... I... C-H-I-C-K Come, feel it again. Stroke it smooth and gently. You look very happy. Yeah? Did you move to the country for your father? No, I didn't move for him. He moved for me. I see. You're doing such a great job with Eun-hae. No, you're amazing. I only have one kid but you take care of the farm, two kids and your father. The kids are normal at least... I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it like that. That's okay. It is what it is. I ain't deny it. Just a minute. Hello? Dad, why are you looking for that again? You must have kept it somewhere. That's not mine. Have you looked in your drawer? What about mom's dresser? Okay. I'll be right there. Did you do it yourself? I'm pretty good with my hands. Eun-hae looks so pretty. Mister, come out for a minute. Someone's here for you. Jae-sik! Why didn't you answer your phone? I've been looking all over for you. Come on. You can at least pretend to be happy to see me. - Let's talk outside. - Outside? It's payback time. You're looking good. They say you can make a lot of money doing YouTube. Wow, how did your scheme work out? You're good at those things. Do you need any help from me? - Cheol-jin, don't... - What? You said this was a business trip. Didn't you come here to settle some overdue account? What a loser. You're so pathetic. You don't have time for this. Get a hold of yourself! You have the guts to steal from me. You should be doing something cooler. Look at you. All you found yourself is a retarded kid. Gee... You've sure got a long way to go. I'll give you $2000 for the van. Pay the rest back in a week. Don't try to pull any kind of stunt. Have some sense of responsibility! Please! Dammit! What was I thinking? I'm a goddamn loser. Jae-sik... What happened to your face? It's nothing. Where's Eun-hae? She's with grandpa. What? Dad! Hello, how have you been? It's good to see you. Eun-hae! Dad! Sir! Eun-hae! Dad! - Sir! - Dad! Eun-hae! - Eun-hae! - Dad! - Eun-hae! - Dad! Don't you ever disappear like that again! T, E, A, R... T, E, A, R... Jae-sik, are you up? Jae-sik? ('Look in the jar outside.') Are you Eun-hae's dad? I'll get straight to the point. Where are you? - I'll bring Eun-hae there. - Wait! Eun-hae. Let's go. (Children's Shelter) Give me a moment. This may be the last time I see her. Yes. This place would be better for you than staying with me. (T, E, A, R...) Good job... You want to know who you are? (E, U, N.. H, A, E) Eun-hae... (E, U, N.. H, A, E) Me? (D, A, D...)
