Man: Today, children everywhere are making preparations for an event of world-shaking significance... The annual visit of Santa Claus. Informed sources report legions of junior citizens are making monumental efforts not to cry and not to pout. Meanwhile, letters by the thousands have been flooding postal facilities at the North Pole. Doggone thing always conks out when you... Well, hello there! My name's special delivery Kloogle... S.D. for short. Oh, I've got lots of letters for Santa today, and every year, they're the same. Some ask for toys, but a lot ask questions. Like, you take this one. I bet one of you wrote it. Child: "Dear Santa, why do you wear a red suit?" Uh-huh. I thought so. And this one... Child: My turn. "Dear Santa, "why do you comedown the chimney when I'm asleep?" How about these? Child: Why do you have whiskers? Boy: Why do you live at the North Pole? Boy: Why do you leave presents? Girl: Why do you always come on Christmas Eve? Girl: Why do some people call you Kris Kringle? Children: Why? Why? Now, hold on, hold on! I can answer all your questions because I know everything about Santa. Now, Santa is a busy man. He has no time to play. He's got millions and millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day. So you'd better write your letter now and mail it right away, because he's getting ready with his reindeers and his sleigh. ♪ So... you better watch out ♪ ♪ You better not cry ♪ ♪ You better not pout ♪ ♪ I'm telling you why ♪ So you want to know all about Santa, eh? Best place to start is at the very beginning, when Santa was just a little baby. Child: You mean, Santa was once... [Giggles] A baby? Of course. Everybody's got to be a baby at least once in their lives. Now, this was years and years ago... Oh, way back. In one of the northern countries, there was a small city called Sombertown. It was a cold, cold place which shivered in the shadows of the strange Mountain of the Whispering Winds. [Thunder] Now, the main reason for all this gloom was the mayor... a mean old grouch of a fellow who was known as Burgermeister Meisterburger. [Children laughing] Herr Burgermeister! Herr Burgermeister! Look what was discovered on your front stoop! What? What, Grimsly? The milk? The daily paper? No, sir... a baby! Oh, is that all? [Choking] A baby?! And there's a note. "Please, sir, take care of my child, and protect him from the dangers of the Mountain of the Whispering Winds. He will be exceptional if only given the love he needs." I, Burgermeister Meisterburger, take care of a baby? Outrageous! What's its name? This is the only clue, sir. It says, "Claus." Oh, take the little baggage to the orphan asylum. That's the proper place for foundlings, anyway. [Baby crying] Get that brat out of here! [Wind howling] Oh! The sleigh... it broke away! Oh, my goodness! Where are you, baby Claus? Oh, do come back! Come back! Narrator: Well, that strange wind blew the little sleigh right up to the Mountain of the Whispering Winds. [Thunder] For, you see, that Mountain was the home of the awful, the terrible... Oh, I hate to even say his name! That Mountain was the home of the... Winter Warlock... The strange hermit of the north who lived alone in a ghostly palace of ice, practicing his strange spells and snowy incantations. [Thunder] The animals knew they had to hide that baby, and fast. [Footsteps] They knew where that baby belonged, so, quick as they could, they started on their way. Child: Where? Where? Well, you see, just beyond the Mountain was Rainbow River Valley, and there, by a bend in the magical stream, was the home of a jolly family of little people... Elves, you might call them. Kringle was their name. The door was answered by an elf named Dingle... Dingle Kringle, to be precise. Yes? Who's there? There's who? Ooh! Wiggle my ears and tickle my toes! Methinks I see a baby's nose! It's more than a nose. There's a whole baby attached to it! Better call my brothers. Wingle! Bingle! Tingle! Zingle! What is it, Dingle? It's a baby, Zingle. A baby what, Wingle? A baby baby, Tingle. I like babies, Bingle. Our baby's the best baby of them all, Wingle. Narrator: They brought the little fella to the elf queen, Tanta Kringle. A baby! What a splendid idea! He shall live with us and sleep with us and drink warm cocoa with us. What will we call him, Tanta Kringle? His license says, "Claus." Unusual name. However, we shall call him Kris... Kris Kringle. [All cheering] Narrator: Well, those little Kringles took that baby to their hearts. Soon as he was old enough, they set up a little school and taught him all the important things... How to read and write and talk and count stars on a crystal night, and how to make toys. Child: Make toys? Oh, sure. That was the Kringles' main occupation. They were toymakers. The only problem was there were no children to give them to. You remember, Sombertown was on the other side of the Mountain of the Whispering Winds, and the little elves just couldn't make it past the Winter Warlock. So... The toys kind of stacked up some. It's really quite sad. We will never be able to transport our toys over the mountain. Someday, when I am bigger, I'll take them for you, Tanta Kringle. Oh, that will be the day! We will be great toymakers again, as we once were. When was that, Tanta? Oh, years and years ago. The Kringles were world-renowned, for, you know, we were the very first royal toymakers... The first toymakers to the King. ♪ It's a difficult responsibility ♪ ♪ When you accept an appointment from his majesty ♪ ♪ You must strive for just the perfect quality ♪ ♪ When you're the first toymaker to the King ♪ ♪ All the soldiers must stand erect ♪ ♪ For the Kingdom they protect ♪ ♪ The balls must bounce much higher ♪ ♪ If they're to please his royal sire ♪ ♪ The ballerinas must pirouette ♪ ♪ Upon their musical toes ♪ ♪ And the clowns must make a King forget ♪ ♪ All his Kingly woes ♪ ♪ It's a difficult responsibility ♪ ♪ When you accept an appointment from his majesty ♪ ♪ You must strive for just the perfect quality ♪ ♪ When you're the first toymaker to the King ♪ ♪ All the sailboats must never sink ♪ ♪ And the dollies always wink ♪ ♪ The Teddy Bears be furry ♪ ♪ If they're to gain his royal curry ♪ ♪ The Jack-in-Boxes must always pop ♪ ♪ At every regal command ♪ ♪ And the kangaroos must learn to hop ♪ ♪ Into the Prince's hand ♪ ♪ It's a difficult responsibility ♪ ♪ When you accept an appointment from his majesty ♪ ♪ You must strive for just the perfect quality ♪ ♪ When you're the first toymaker to the King ♪ [Applause] Child (voice-over): So that's why he makes such wonderful toys. Narrator: That's why. The Kringles taught him everything they knew. Of course, Kris had other teachers... The animals. But the seals taught him the most important things... How to have fun and... Ho ho ho ho! Ho ho ho ho! How to laugh... Real hard and wonderful, like he meant it. Ho ho ho ho! Well, years went by, and finally, Kris was a fine young man. I'm a man now, Tanta. I can take those toys across the Mountain of the Whispering Winds. It would be nice if someone played with our toys. If only one of my dollies could be held tight by a little girl. It's decided, then. Tomorrow, I leave for Sombertown. [All cheering] Tanta Kringle? Ah, I was just packing. Did I wake you up? I was awake anyhow. I made this for your trip. A real Kringle suit! Child (voice-over): So that's where he got the red suit. Narrator: Yep, and he's always worn one just like it, right to this day. Well, Kris said good-bye to all his friends... Elf and animal. Just as night was falling, Kris started to make his way through the dismal forest which lay at the foot of the Warlock's Mountain. Kris: Hey! Why... why, you're a penguin. [Honk] Well, what is a penguin doing here? [Glug glug] You're looking for a stick? - [Honk] A branch? A log? A pole? [Honk honk] The North Pole? - [Glug] No? The South Pole! [Honk honk] Well, little feller, that's on the other end of the Earth. You're just about as lost as you could get. You better travel with me. You need someone to take care of you. - [Kiss] - Now, cut that out. Come on, uh, Topper. I'll call you Topper. Ok? - [Honk honk] Come on. This way, little feller. Voice: Who nears my mountain? Go back... Or you are doomed! Come on, Topper! [Evil laughter] I shall get him when he returns. He's got to cross my mountain on the way home, and then... [Laughing] No more being the nice guy. [Laughing] We made it, Topper. And... And look! Sombertown... Just sitting there waiting for us and our good Kringle toys! Narrator: That's what they thought. But what they didn't realize was at that very moment in the Sombertown City Hall... Grimsly: His honor... Burgermeister Meisterburger. As I suspected... You've broken your funny bone. Ohh... What caused me to trip, Grimsly? This, sir. Hmm? A toy? As I suspected. I hate toys, and toys hate me. Either they are going or I am going, and I am certainly not going, Grimsly.

Nice day, friend. Don't "Hi" me. Good morning, ma'am. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, young man, wearing such outlandish clothes. Clothes? Look, all I want to do is give away these toys. Toys?! Townspeople: Toys?! Oh! Get him out of here! [All shouting at once] What did I say? [Honk] Well, what's going on here? We're doing our chores. Yeah, and no more playing. No playing, eh? Are you washing out... stockings? Uh-huh. It's one of our daily duties. Then we hang them by the fireplace so they dry overnight. That's the only way they judge you around here... By how many chores you do and how clean your stockings are. Is that so? Well, uh, you don't have to look so glum about it. Why? I don't know. I just don't like sour faces. Now, I got some real nice goodies for you, but not if you look like this. You better watch out. Better not cry. Better not pout. [Both] Why? I'm telling you why! [Both] Yeah? 'Cause I came to town, and look what I brought. [Both] Toys! Real toys! Why, sure... Compliments of the Kringles. But... but what about the Burgermeister? What about him? If he wants a toy, he may have one. I'll save him a big red yo-yo. [Laughing] Come on. Let's play! Yeah! Come on! Woman: Wait! You must not play with toys. And, uh, who are you? That's miss Jessica, our new schoolteacher. Kris Kringle at your service, Miss Jessica. How dare you come here in those ridiculous clothes and make fun of me? Clothes again? I wasn't making... And what do you mean by giving the children toys? Don't you know toys are against the law? - What? - Yep. It's true. Gee. That's kind of a silly law. If the Burgermeister saw you, we would all be in great danger. In danger from toys? Why, that's the silliest thing I ever heard. Toys are frivolous, impractical, unproductive, and... What's that? For you. A China doll? I always wanted one when I was a little girl, but my parents wouldn't... [Kisses doll] Oh! Thank you. I mean... Watch out for that Dolly. She's a hardened criminal, I hear. Well, maybe it is a silly law. I mean... What do you say you help me hand out these presents, huh?

Everybody is glum. Ah, see? All the little children are playing with their toys. [Sputters] Playing with their toys?! Stop... in the name of the law! You brats are under arrest! Take them away. Don't arrest those children! It was my fault. I gave them the toys. You?! How dare you? You are obviously a nonconformist and a rebel! Me? Rebel? Arrest this man immediately. For you. [Sputters] A yo-yo? I love yo-yos! I used to be able to do all kinds of tricks. Whee! Hoo hoo hoo! Hee hee! Hoo hoo hoo! Excuse me, sir, but you're breaking your own laws. What? What are you saying? What? [Sputtering] Ooh... Ooh! Ooh, I have been bamboozled! Arrest him! Arrest him! Burgermeister: Oh, look! He climbs like a squirrel, leaps like a deer, and is as slippery as a seal. After him! He went into the woods! We'll never find him in there. I guess we lost 'em, Topper. Slow down, now. Ooh-whee! Wonder where we are. [Honk honk] "You are trespassing on the lands of the Winter Warlock." [Tree roars] Hey! Hey, let go! Let go! Kris Kringle... You've disturbed me for the very last time. Now I have you... And you'll never get away! [Laughing evilly] [Warlock laughing] Look, uh, before you do me in, would you tell your tree friends to let me loose for a second? You see, I have something for you. What is this, a trick? Oh, oh, no, sir, Mr. Warlock, or may I call you "Winter"? Mr. Warlock, if you please! Oh. Well, I managed to save one little toy... And I'd like you to have it. You... You wish to give me... A present? A... A toy? Yes, sir. But... nobody ever gives mean old Warlock... a toy. I'd like to start a new custom. If you'd just call off... Wha... what? Oh, oh, yeah. Uh, heh heh heh! Oh, yes, of course. But you mustn't mind the tree monsters. Their bark is worse than their bite. Ha ha ha! "Their bark is worse than their bite." Ha ha ha! Hey, uh, Willie Willow, Peter Pine, release the Kringle, hmm? [Chuckling] Yeah. And no tricks, now. Oh, oh, no. No, sir, Mr. Warlock. A choo-choo. [Kissing] I've always wanted one. [Sobbing] [Water running] What's that? It's... my icy heart. It's melting. Well, look, Mr. Warlock... Please, please, call me "Winter." "Winter"? Oh, yes, yes! Suddenly, my whole outlook has changed from bad to good. Great. Ah... but will it last? I really am a mean and despicable creature at heart, you know. It's so difficult to... Really change. Difficult? Ha ha ha! Why, look here.

Someone is looking for you. Kris! Kris! Kris: Jessica? Winter: Go to her, lad. Oh! Only me, ma'am. I thought I'd never find you again. I wanted to bring you these... Letters and notes from the children of Sombertown, asking for more toys. You see, the Burgermeister destroyed the ones you brought. You tell those young'uns there'll be plenty of toys, but only if they behave themselves. No cryin' or poutin' or... Oh, I... I'll know. I got ways of knowin'. My, uh, personal friend, the Warlock, taught me this. Yes, sir, I can see 'em when they're sleepin', and I know when they're awake. My goodness. You know if they're bad or good? Uh-huh. So you tell them to be good, for goodness' sake. Oh, thank you, Kris. For what? For being so kind, for just being you. [Kiss] Gol-Lee! Now, uh... About the toys... I'll have to kind of slip 'em in after dark, when the Burgermeister is asleep, so you tell all the boys and girls to leave their doors unlocked tomorrow night. Narrator: Well, Kris went back to the Kringles' to get some more toys. And what do you think those crazy Kringles did? Yes, sir, they all moved in on old Winter... Lock, stock, and toy box. I guess they figured it made sense to move the source of supply close to the demand. Oh, I'm crowded! [Chuckles] But at least I'm loved. Narrator: Kris made a list of all the children and the toys they wanted. He checked it over once, then checked it over twice. He tried to figure out just who was naughty and who was nice. Well, I guess they're all pretty nice. Narrator: So he packed up and was off to Sombertown. [Honking] Narrator: When Kris was safe inside Sombertown, he tried all the doors, and if they were open, he knew a child lived inside who was expecting a toy. This is outrageous! Toys! Toys everywhere! What sort of criminal is this Kringle, sneaking into houses by night? I hereby decree that all the town's doors and windows will be locked tight against this prowler! Narrator: Well, more and more letters came for Kris from the children. Jessica would gather them together and then give them to the animals, who would deliver them. And Kris, well, he just couldn't turn anybody down. But this time, he found all the doors were locked to him. Now, there was one special toy he just had to deliver. Susie, a tiny little girl who was very, very sick, had asked Kris for a toy Noah's ark. Kris just couldn't disappoint her. [Honking] Topper, shh. What is it? You have an idea... How to get into the house, but not through the door? Up? The sky? The moon? The stars? The chimney? Go down the chimney? [Kiss] Great idea! Well... Here goes. Narrator: And that's how he started going down chimneys. Child: Oh! Now I understand. Kris: That's fun! What a great job I've got. [Honking] [Kris laughing] Ho ho ho ho! Come on. There's a lot more chimneys to explore tonight. Ha ha ha! Ho ho ho! More toys! Discovered by the hearths and the mantel pieces! Each house in Sombertown will be searched before dawn. If any more toys are found by the fireplace, they will be confiscated and the children severely punished! So be it! Yow! Narrator: But those letters just kept right on coming. Doggone, how can I get the toys to them? They got to have toys. Otherwise, their life will be nothing but school and chores and washing their stockings and... The stockings. The stockings! Take this to Jessica. She'll know what to tell the children. Burgermeister: Company, halt! Search the premises! If you find so much as one marble or half a Jack, the house is under arrest! Double time, hup! We can't find anything, Herr Burgermeister. Good. Very good. No toys. Nothing but drying stockings... Ha ha ha... As is proper. About face! Forward, march! Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup... Whew! Thank heaven there were no toys. Children: Whee! Look! Narrator: And that's how he started leaving presents in stockings. More toys? But how? Ow! Blast it! On my toe-ho-ho! I will do what I should have done a long time ago. I will set a trap for that bothersome Kringle. His next visit to Sombertown will be his last. [Gasps] Oh, no! I must warn Kris. Narrator: But she was too late. Kris had already left with his toys. Oh, Mr. Warlock... Uh, "Winter," please. You must help me stop Kris. Please, use your magic. Oh... alas. I've been... disenchanted. I have no more powers. I can't even do card tricks. Oh, that's terrible! What shall we do? Grimsly: Nobody is going to do anything! You are all under arrest for defying the law and making toys, and for being an accomplice to public enemy number one, Kris Kringle! To the dungeon! Narrator: Oh, I tell you, things didn't look good. And meanwhile, back in Sombertown... Stop! You are under arrest! Not me! Wait! Look! [Honking] What can I do? You have me. Ha ha ha ha! To the dungeon! Children of Sombertown, you will never, never, play again! [Children crying] Well, sir, it looked like Kris was finally beaten. Herr Burgermeister, please. You must set Kris and the little Kringles free. Ho ho! Ha ha! Set them free? Never. I promise they will never disturb you again. Bah! What good are your promises? Good-bye, good luck, and good riddance! My own town, turned against me. Well, my eyes are beginning to open for the very first time to what life is really all about. And I know just where I belong...

[Knocking] Mr. Warlock. Hmm? Oh! Oh, Jessica. Oh, "Winter," please. What are you doing here? Trying to set you all free, but I don't know how. If only you had your magic powers back. Alas, I've nothing but a few meager magic leftovers here in my pockets: A short-circuited wand... useless; A dried-up magic potion... powerless; The tiny stubs of 100 or so magic candles; And a few, last handfuls of magic feed corn... just junk. Ha ha. Ah, me. Magic feed corn? Well, it's of no use to us. It can't dissolve prison walls. All it can do is make reindeer fly. Reindeer? Fly? Yes, yes. Ridiculous, isn't it? Narrator: Later that night, Jessica rounded up some of Kris' reindeer friends. They just had to take one nibble of that corn, and... Whoo-ee! Look at them go! I bet you know their names. Girl: Dasher and Dancer... Boy: And Prancer and Vixen... Second boy: And Comet and Cupid... Second girl: And Donner and Blitzter. Narrator: Yes, sir. First girl: And don't forget... [Beep] Narrator: Heh heh heh! No, that's another story. Halt! Stop! Stop! Let's go, Donner. Let's gooooo... Tanta Kringle: Onward, Vixen! Onward! Well, I still have a little magic! Ho ho! I'm not such a loser after all! [Honking] Girl: And that's how Santa's reindeer started to fly? Narrator: That's just the way it happened. We Meisterburgers shall hunt them down throughout the land. Those rebels will not have one moment's peace until they are captured again. Ha ha ha! It's not even safe here. The guardsmen will be coming back. We'll have to push on. I'll go anywhere you say, Kris. Narrator: Like Robin Hood of old, Kris suddenly found himself called an outlaw. Burgermeister: "Wanted dead or alive, the terrible toymaker..." "Kris Kringle." Ho ho ho ho ho! Well, those posters are not going to do them any good now. Oh, Kris, let me take a good look at it. Pretty grand, eh? [Giggles] It's perfect. Well, since I'm a Kringle, I had to grow one sooner or later. [Children giggling] Girl: So that's why he has whiskers. Ah, but you should not use your Kringle name. It's dangerous. Not call myself Kringle? What other name would suit me? There is one. You were wearing this when we found you as a baby. See what it says? "Claus." Claus? Your real name. You must use it now. Boy: I knew it, I knew it! That's where he got his name from. Narrator: Mm-hmm, and it was that name he asked Jessica to share. It was that name Jessica agreed to take, as his wife. Girl: Jessica. Oh, she became Mrs. Santa Claus. Narrator: It was a lovely wedding. Yes, sir. They held it on Christmas Eve, and since no town would welcome them, they stood before the Lord in the silent winter woods, and a grove of pine trees was their cathedral. They put all that pretty stuff onto the pine trees, and then Kris and Jessica placed their wedding gifts to each other under the trees. No church ever looked nicer. Oh, please... Let me have... Just a little magic. Children: Ahh! Girl: The very first Christmas trees.

This is it. We'll build ourselves a nice house. Ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho... Heck... ho ho... while we're at it, we'll build ourselves a castle. Ho ho ho ho ho! And the best toy factory in the world. Narrator: And that's just what they did. And in no time at all... Child: Santa's castle and workshop! Girl: Up at the North Pole! Narrator: Well, as soon as the buildings were built, they settled in and started making toys in earnest. Oh, they needed toys, because, you see, despite everything the Meisterburgers tried, the legend of Kris Kringle... or Claus, as he now was known... Just grew and grew. And, as the years went by, animals delivered letters by the thousands. Oh, just look at this list. [Sighs] Well... Load up the sleigh. Ho ho! Ah, this is the fourth trip this month. Narrator: You see, he still had to travel by night because he was considered an outlaw. Girl: But when did they stop calling him an outlaw? Narrator: Well, as time went by, that changed. You see, the Meisterburgers... They kind of died off and fell out of power. And by and by, the good people realized how silly the Meisterburger laws were. Well, everybody had a wonderful laugh and then forgot all about them. Yes, sir. The older he got, the more famous he became, and the more folks loved him. Girl: He's very good, isn't he? Narrator: Uh-huh. You bet. Girl: Is that why he's called "Santa Claus"? Narrator: That's why, honey. That's why. It turned into quite a proposition. I can hardly keep up with the orders. I'm afraid I'm going to have to limit my journeys to... one a year. But on which night should I go out? I wonder. Narrator: It wasn't a hard decision to make. They chose, of course, the holiest night of the year... The night of profound love, which was the perfect night for giving. Girl: Christmas Eve? Narrator: Christmas Eve, and that's how it all started. How goes it, Mr. Warlock? "Winter," please. I've got my magic power working just fine. I can cast up a big freeze. Yes, sir. I think I can guarantee a white Christmas. Wonderful! Then let's be off! Santa: Away we go! And that is the story of Santa Claus. Girl: Gee, he's so wonderful. Everybody must love him. Well... most everybody. Oh, he's not considered an outlaw anymore, but there still are some... Eh, bah! Humbug! Christmas is a bother... The noise, the crowds. I really wish it were outlawed. How can they talk about Santa Claus when there's so much unhappiness in the world? Poor, misguided folks. They missed the whole point. Lots of unhappiness? Maybe so. But doesn't Santa take a little bit of that unhappiness away? Doesn't a smile on Christmas morning scratch out a tear cried on a Saturday? Not much, maybe. But what would happen if we all tried to be like Santa and learn to give as only he can give of ourselves, our talents, our love, and our hearts? Maybe if we could all learn Santa's beautiful lesson, maybe there would finally be peace on earth and goodwill toward man. Hey, it's getting late, and I've got these letters to deliver. And you better be getting home, too. Children: Oh! And remember... Behave yourselves, 'cause Santa can still look into his magic snowball and see just what you're up to.
