"Once upon a time..." Food! Quick, or we won't get anything Gustav! Johan! "Yes, Miss Hawk", you should say. Well? - Yes. - Yes, Hiss Mawk. - Your beds were sloppily made today. The copper is empty. It has to be filled before evening. Go and eat. First we say grace. Dear God, bless this food. Amen. Where's Rasmus? Where have you been, Rasmus? - In the toilet. - Next time you're late you'll go without. Sit. After dinner, the girls help me here and the boys tidy up outside. Then get washed and tidy yourselves up. Get really clean. It might be worth while. A gentleman and lady are coming to look at you. Maybe one of you will get a father and a mother. Someone might get a father and a mother ... What if it was me? - Get away with you! Stop dreaming. They always take girls with curly hair. - Maybe someone wil want a boy with straight hair. - They want a nice little girl. - Well, you never know. Hurry up, boys! Take that as well. Just get a move on! Welcome. - Thank you. This is my wife. - Ah yes. Welcome. - Miss Hawk, I understand? - Yes. You're here in good time! What a nice lady! - Uh-huh.... Good afternoon! - Are there just boys? - Of course not. The girls are inside. There they are. Go into the dining room, boys. Maybe you want to see the children right away? - Yes please. Please step inside. Will you permit me to offer you a small cup of coffee? - Good afternoon to you. - Stand in a line. So the lady and gentleman can get a proper look at you. Come on, Johan, there's nothing to be afraid of. Of course. - Come on, little Greta, and say hello politely. How old are you? - Seven. I'll be eight in August. Let's go to my office, so you can talk undisturbed with the girl. You can go out and play again. - Does anyone want a curly-haired girl? - Are you jealous, eh? - The trick is to find someone who wants you. - You think so, eh? You should run away and look for someone who has no children. - What good would that be? - Well, then they'd have no-one to choose from. -You're daft. - Escape, if you want. You'll probably come back when you get hungry. And then you'll get spanked! Hurry up! The Hawk's coming! - Gunnar, wash yourself properly! Sorry, I didn't mean it... - Oh really. We'll talk again tomorrow. Get some rags. Mop up this water! And the rest of you, why don't you get to bed? Hang up your clothes properly. Rasmus and Gunnar. Seeing you're both so fond of water... ... you can scrub all the floors tomorrow. As a treat. I'll be back in a little while. This had better be finished. Gunnar ... - What? - I'm going to run away tonight. - You're crazy! But sure, go ahead if you want. I'm not coming with you. Don't have time. I have to scrub the floors tomorrow. - Not me! I've had enough of this orphanage and these old floors. Miss! Miss! Rasmus has run away! - What are you talking about! - Yes, it's true! He hasn't been in his bed all night! - He told me yesterday he was going to run away. - Everyone who's ready, run and see if he's outside. Look everywhere. Why would he run away? - He said he was fed up with the orphanage. - -We'll see. But he will get a spanking! - That's what I said. Wonder where he is. Good morning. - Good morning. - You look scared. Do you think I eat children? What are you doing here? Have you run away from home? - No... not from home. - I see... You're not really a tramp like me, are you? - Are you a tramp, sir? - Oh-ho yes, I certainly am. But not every day, no. By no means every day. Do you ... want a sandwich? - Yes please! - Here. - What's your name by the way? - Rasmus. - What? - Rasmus. - Rasmus. Odd name. Who gave you that? - I don't know. What's your name, sir? - Sir! Do I look like a Sir? - No. Sir looks like a tramp. -So don't Sir me then, please! - But what's your name? - There are many kinds of people. Directors, counts, barons ... If you ask my name, know what I say? I am the tramp of Paradise, God's best friend. That's why I'm called Paradise Oskar! - Is it fun to be a paradise tramp? - Oh yes, you can be sure of that. I'd like to be one too. - People like you can't be tramps. - Why not? - You should be at home with your father and mother. - I don't have a father and mother. I'll find some though. But... Do you think there's anyone who'd want a boy with straight hair? - Of course! Lots would like a boy with straight hair, As long as he's honest. - Honest? But I am! At least... a bit. Can I come with you while I'm looking? - Looking for someone who wants a boy with straight hair? - Yes... you could... You could be my partner on the road. I make a living playing the accordion. - The accordion! - Then you can collect the money while I play. - Collect the money? So I get to be a paradise tramp too? - Yes, a pint-sized one. - Can we go tramping right away, please? - Yes, we can. - We have to tramp far away. I don't want to go back to the orphanage! - You're from the orphanage ... - They can get kids wherever they want, but they don't touch my partner! - Oskar! Don't walk so fast. - We were supposed to go far away today. - But I said we, didn't you hear? - Of course! I heard. They'll enjoy music here. We'll tug at their heartstrings. The billowing fields full of rye and wheat Are waving as if on a foamy sea. The Lekensberg cattle have plenty to eat The cowbells are chiming The swallows are climbing Like snow in the sky floating clouds we can see. Trala lala lalej Then I think of you Trala lala lalej Then I think of you Trala lala lalej Then I think of you Trala lala lalej Then I think of you Hey, give us "Elvira Madigan"! - No. It?ll only make me cry. Besides, I don't know all the verses. - How about this: On flower-clad hill Sat Hjalmar singing ... - No, I can't remember anymore. - Good. I've never been able to stand that Hjalmar fellow. - Thanks, Margit. - There's a tramp here singing.. And he's got a little boy with him. - Well, you should give him a coin. At home his beautiful sweetheart pining away the vagabond's dark-eyed Emma, sweet as the day Her hair, as black as the darkest night Is it so strange then that I long for her light? Hello - Hello - What dirty hands you have! - That's nothing comapred to my feet! ... Without a sole of leather Dancing along She fights with the girls And when she gets sick of them She starts on the boys And takes on the pick of them Her lips are so red and her hands have a quality as if they belong to a maid of nobility. - Here: come and have some sandwiches and fried eggs. - My little friend and love flower, beautiful as a rose petal! - How crazy he is today! - Goodbye, my beautiful maidens. - Beautiful maidens indeed! Oskar, hide! - What is it? - Let me try something. Look! - You're a financial genius! - Five ?re! It's wonderful to live as a tramp! We can eat now, yes? - Yes of course. - Then I can keep an eye on the gate at the same time. - Now. Let's see. What good stuff have we got here? Very good! Here's some eggs. - Bags this one. Yes, you get this one. - Teach me a song, Oskar. Just for me. - Can you sing, then? - You think you're such a good singer? - Don't I sing well ...? - You probably won't make the Opera, but you croak quite well. Is he going to sleep all day? - Get up! Get up, I said! - Yes ... your hands are so cold ! - I've had a wash. - Had a wash? Ugh. I dreamed that a bullfinch was walking on my neck. - A bullfinch? - It had cold feet ... - I dreamt I lived in a flat, And there I had a cat. - What did you say? - I dreamt I lived in a flat, And there I had a cat. - "- I dreamt I lived in a flat, And there I had a cat.." That rhymes. - So it does. - It rhymes! It's poetry! Maybe one day you'll be a famous minstrel! - Oh sure! - OK ... I dreamt I lived in a flat... I dreamt I had a cat ... and ... What did the cat have? - It was a wonderful dream: I lived in a lovely flat, I had a mother and father- - And a cat - Oh yes, and a cat. I fed him herring and potatoes! - Herring and potatoes! And he ate it? - Yes he did! - How about .... I dreamt I lived in a flat And there I had a cat... and ... ... he only ate herring and potatoes! - Is that all? ... he only ate herring and potatoes ... - Believe it if you wish ... -... he ate only potatoes and fish ... ... that's just what little kittens love. Well... there isn't much we can rhyme with "potatoes"... Get the accordion. - Yes, bring out the squeezebox! I dreamt I lived in a flat ... - And there I had a cat... ...it must have belonged to us ... No ... ... it wiggled its bum like a dance ... Believe it if you must... but it really wagged its tail ... -... little kittens ... they do what? - Wag their tails! Believe it if you will, but it really wagged its tail... Now everything makes perfect sense! Let's make another verse. I was sitting in the flat Playing with my cat... Oh, how it tried to bite and scratch me! - Bravo! ...And believe it if you wish ... ... But I had to throw some fish ... ... lalala lalala la la ... catch me ... ... And believe it if you wish but I had to throw some fish ... So that naughty little kitten wouldn't catch me! Well, we've made a song! I'm hungry. Can we sing to get money for some herring and potatoes together ? - With this song we could even get cabbage rolls! ... But it seems to be true That you'll eat it too ... ... 'Cos you're just a naughty little kitten! - Oh, big cats too, Oskar! - Yes you're right about that. So you've got time to play the accordion? - Might two hungry tramps maybe get something to eat - Aren't you the one who got a whole meat pudding in the summer? - It's finished, and I survived. - Very funny. If you want food, you have to work. - My husband is in hospital, he's very ill. - Did he have a meat pudding too? - Rasmus, ssh! - I could do with some help. Stay with me for a few hours? A few hours?! Well ... it depends on what's on the stove. Meat pudding. - We'll help her anyway. I'm so hungry. Could I have a sandwich right now? - Yes, of course. - Thanks! Meat pudding ...! Not so fast! What kind of a tramp are you? Aren't you going to bathe properly? You should wash your whole body, like this. Haven't you ever done that? - Yes ... Yes, once. - Haven't you ever showered, either? - I keep clean bit by bit. - Then you should do it now! - Look out! - Don't be upset, bathing is healthy! - It's really nice. Who'd have thought water could be so nice! - Come on out now, time to eat. - Can't I stay a little longer? - No. Come on out. - You're mean... - Yep! Pancakes. And meatballs! Shouldn't you take off your wet clothes? - No, if I did I'd be warm again. This will taste wonderful after the bath. - You didn't want to work for that lady! - When it comes to work, I'm satisfied with very little. - Know what I think? - What? - I think you're a real lazy beggar. - Oh really? - Has no one given you a real job? - Yes, it has happened, but for the most part I have only met nice people. - Then you've been lucky! - Here's fine. - Yes, this'll do. Here. You have the sweater. It'll be nice to get some sleep. - Goodnight, sleep well. - Thanks. Goodnight. You too. - Damn! All these mosquitoes! I want to kill them. Listen. Don't kill on a Saturday. That's the law of the wild prairie. Know what to do? - What? - You can fool them. Snuggle into the hay so they don't see you. - Good night. - Good night. There's someone here. - What is it? Wha-... - Are you alone? - No, I've got the whole family here. - 18 million mosquitoes, a flea and me. - OK. Come with me now! - Take him. - We'll go the quickest way ... What were you doing last Friday? - Last Friday? What day would that be ... Yes, that couild have been Friday. - What were you doing then? - I was eating pea soup and pork. - Pea soup and pork! On a Friday? - Oh no, sorry, that was Thursday. Last Friday I was in the laundry. - Don't try to wriggle out of it. Just tell us what you've been doing the last three days. Where's your accomplice? - I've spoken to the chief of police in Sand?. Our boy here seems to have had nothing to do with the assault. You can come out now. - What? - You can get on your way. - Pity. I was getting to like it here. Why was I put in jail? - There was a robbery at the Sand? mill. Read for yourself. "Two masked men" ... Is that supposed to be me? Two? Me?! - Yes. Take the paper with you as a souvenir. I don't have any more time for you. - You have more people to arrest? Goodbye. Oskar! What have you done? Why did they take you away? - I haven't done anything. They claimed I'd been involved in a robbery and an assault. - Robbery and assault! - Two men were somewhere last Friday. They used a gun. - Two? Did they think it was us? - Who knows. - We hadn't even met last Friday! - No, you're right... - Trust me, Oskar, I really had nothing to do with it!. - Oh of course. I knew you didn't - And I felt the same about you too. Good morning! What are the gentlemen going to do? - We're going to stay for a few days and do some fishing. - How nice! We don't get many gentlemen here. - Miss Ros?n is always so kind and friendly. - You're welcome to borrow the boat. - That's nice of you. I'll go and buy some hooks ... We can do a tour later. Oops ... Well I never ... One of my old girl-friends! - Not any more... - That can be changed ... - But why would I want to? - We can't stand out here in full view. Come with me. It's a little quieter here. So tell me, what are you doing here? And what on earth is that! - I have a position here as a maid. Being your girlfriend didn't pay any money. I don't want to starve to death. - Yeah yeah, I get it. So how are you? - Fine. I take care of a rich old woman. We live together in a house over there. You should have seen today. She had a lady visiting. When I came in with coffee ... Thanks very much. Would Anna-Stina hand me that bag over there? - Thank you. Can we have some cream too? - Certainly. - So you've got another new maid? - Yes, dear ... It's hard to get them to stay. I'm just glad I have someone.. But she's not very good at washing up. Would you please open the desk drawer and take out the casket in there? When I'm gone, please do something for me. Send this to my daughter in America. It's the only thing I have left of any real value. I will sign a document to say that you are to send it to my daughter in America. - Oooh, she'll be so pleased!! Shame the necklace is being sent across the Atlantic! I'd have a better use for it. - So just take it and disappear. - If I run away and the necklace is gone, it won't take the Chief of Police long to figure it out. - Is there any value in the necklace? - Yeah, I think it's diamond. We have our little summer path That rambles to and fro, The sun that shines from time to time, And we have nothing more We're checking on the Fredrikssons To see if they're doing well. Who are they? The castles of the little ant Too beautiful to tell. To those little ones we go, How we love to say hello. Even though we can't see, Here will they always be/i> It's a wonderful thing to do! To those little ones we go, How we love to say hello. It's a wonderful thing It's a wonderful thing It's a wonderful thing to do! We hike on a summer meadow, And all you see is green. But twenty million grass blades Are waving here unseen! We're checking on the Sommarssons, Their girl's been feeling bad - Who are they? The poor little mite has cried all night Because she's been feeling very sad! To those little ones we go, How we love to say hello. Even though we can't see, Here will they always be It's a wonderful thing to do! To those little ones we go, How we love to say hello. It's a wonderful thing, It's a wonderful thing It's a wonderful thing to do! What was that? Come here, Anna-Stina! - Madam? What...? What do you want? - Don't worry, we're not dangerous. Where's the key? The key! - No no! Every forest has its spring ... - Keep calm! And flowers in the fields. . . They attract people here. Give them this, and get rid of them. Tell them the mistress is sick. Sssh! You can't play here. The mistress is sick! Take the money and get out! - I usually get fifty ?re here. - Five ?re. - We'll just have to push on, then. - I'm thirsty. Do you think I could get some water? - Sure. I'll wait here. He's coming here! - If you utter a sound, you're dead! Good day. Can I have some water? Here you are. -Thank you. Thank you for the water. Goodbye. - Are you going already? - Yes, I'm a tramp. Goodbye. Oskar! - Hey! Are you OK? - I saw a pair of feet sticking out from behind the curtain. - They can't have been honest feet. - The lady looked really scared, Oskar. We have to find out why. - Can they see us from here? - No, I don't think so. Here. - I can't get through that. - No, but I can. I can do that easily. - No. - Yes I can. You know what they called me at the orphanage? - No? - The creepy-crawlie! - Be quiet! It may be dangerous. - Help me up. - Careful! No no no! Don't take the necklace! Take anything you want, but leave me the necklace! - Keep an eye on them. Let's go. - They've sneaked off! - Yeah, nasty villains! - They took her necklace, even though she cried! Do you live here, Miss? The rest of you go outside please. Andersson, make sure no one comes in. You did not report the assault yesterday. - What was I supposed to do?! I couldn't leave the mistress and he had broken the phone. - How is she? - Bad, I think. The doctor is with her now. Good day, Mrs. Berggren. How are you? - Is it ... is it ...? - Yes, this is the chief of police. - They ... took my ... necklace ... They... - It was too much of a shock for her. - I'd like to ask her a few questions. - Yes, if she regains consciousness. Although that's unlikely. Her he heart is very weak. - Let me know how it goes. Take a seat and listen to me. Your name? - Anna-Stina Karlsson. - Tell me when and how it happened. - It was at eight o'clock. I was washing the dishes. A big tramp came in, and I was scared. I ran in to my mistress. He came after me with a gun. and yelled: "Your money or your life!" - Was he alone? - No. He had a little boy with him. But he drank water all the time ... - Water ... What did he look like? Good morning! Hey, what's the matter? Where's our happy little lady today! - Something terrible has happened! An old lady was robbed yesterday. - Robbed? - In a peaceful place like this! - I believe they plundered the whole house! - The chief of police is there now. Just think! A poor defenceless woman! - Who could do such a thing! - It was probably tthe same ones who robbed the mill. - But they've been traced to Stockholm. - It could have been anyone! - Do you suspect anybody, Miss? Have you heard all the news? Oh it's horrible! If you haven't I'll sing it to you ... That the King of Northern America has been shot in the middle of the day. Tjolahopp tjang tjong fadderalla Tjolahopp tjang tjong fadderej when the King of Northern America was shot in the middle of the day. Then there came a crook through the window Oh what an ugly man was he! In his hand he ws holding a rifle, that was loaded with powder and shot Tjolahopp tjang tjong fadderalla Tjolahopp tjang tjong fadderej Yes, the King of Northern America was shot in the middle of the day. So the noble king went to heaven, Where he sits looking down from his cloud At the Devil tormenting the robber Because he shot that most-belov?d lord! Tjolahopp tjang tjong fadderalla Tjolahopp tjang tjong fadderej Yes, the King of Northern America was shot in the middle of the day! That was him! - Who? - The man with the shoes! He took the necklace! Him and his friend - Are you sure? - Yes of course I'm sure! We have to get the sheriff! Come on! No, no one trusts a tramp, certainly not the sheriff. Then I think he's stupid. - He'll want proof, but we don't have any. - What are we going to do then? - We're getting out of here so he won't arrest me again. Tralala lalala ... No? Maybe we should rest for a while ... Are you feeling all right? Do you have a stomach ache? - Yes, if that's where my conscience is. I feel so sorry for that lady. - Yes, me too. But what can we do? - I think we're cowards if we just sneak off. - When you live as a tramp, you see a lot, but you shouldn't interfere. You can even get into trouble yourself. - Yes, but then you're a coward. - So let's say to the police that two fine gentlemen did it? - Yes! Let's do it! Come on! - The Chief of Police may have a file on a boy missing from the orphanage. - Do you think they've got me on paper? - Yes, it's possible. You see? We're not so brave, you and me, when it comes to saving our own skins. Do you know what us two cowards should do now? - No? - Are you afraid of ghosts? - Ghosts? No idea, I've never seen any. - Then it's time you met some. - There are lots of ghosts around here. - Oh sure! - There are. Come on, I'll show you! - Come on yourself, don't just sit there! - This way ... No one has lived here for over a hundred years. - Why not? - They don't want to live in a place full of ghosts. - Ghosts! Are there really ghosts here? - It might just be what people say. But it's still a weird place. Ha! Did I scare you? - Oskar! - Yeah? - So many empty houses! We could live here! - Yes, if we smoke out the ghosts first. - Stop messing around! We could pretend we live here and you're my father. Couldn't we play that? - We could, but you don't want a tramp for a father, do you? - Well, if the tramp was you. - Get away, you're pulling my leg! - I've found a house over there we can live in. Come on! - We'll live here, OK? - Here?! It looks a little untidy ... - Oh we'll change that! Look! We can pretend this is the bedroom. This is the dining table. - Veal and cucumber, right? Can you conjure up a little veal roast? - Conjure yourself, you big lazy ox! If you don't want to work for food, you could at least pretend with me to get some. - I'm not used to ... But we should help each other. You pretend the veal and I'll do the cucumber. - Yes! Let's do that! - Where are you going? - Out to do some pretending. Here's your chair! - Here's the bed. Where'll we put it? - Here in the corner. We'll be as cosy here as the King himself! Oskar! You can come in now! Hold it! Wipe your feet. - How nicely you've arranged it! - Look at the flowers on the table. Isn't it almost like a real home now? Isn't this a home, then? - N-no... - So do you know what you get in a real home? - No... - Real food... - Where did you get it! - The shopkeeper! Sit down and I'll show you. Look at this! Help yourself. Pork. Almost as good as veal. - It's great! - Definitely! Not asleep yet? - No, There's weird noises here. Do you think it's ghosts? - Not here, no. If any come, I'll bundle them up and throw them in the lake. Good night. - Isn't the moon lovely! The sun only shines during the day when it isn't needed. But the moon lights up when it's dark. - And you talk both night and day. - Sleep well now. - Sleep well! Oskar! The ghosts are coming. - There aren't any ghosts. - They are, can't you hear them? - Ghosts can't talk, can they?. - Come here. You'll see! - You're such a nuisance. - 10,000, at least. - Let's just take it and get out. - The best alibi in the world won't help if they find you with this lot. - We can take some and leave the rest here. - Oh, I'll have some more of the loot! - You're not in charge of it! - OK, here you are then. - What is it? Nobody'll find this place! - Just don't find your way here - alone ... - What, don't you trust me? - Trust me, said the fox, as he bit the chicken's head off! No, it was farther in. Here it is! - Have you ever seen anything like it! - What's that? - It's probably the lady's necklace. - Good, we can give it back to her! What a terrific lot of money! Now we can go to the police and say: Here you are! - He'll only laggh at us. He'll never believe we didn't take it! You got a match? Damn it! The oilcloth! Banknotes can be damaged by moisture. I have to go back. - You have to go back? Guess who's coming with you. We'll hide this ... - What? We'll hide it somewhere else. We'll write to the police and tell them where the necklace and the money are. We'll sign it: "Two honest tramps." Didn't you close the door? -Yes I did. What the hell ... The money and the necklace are gone! They can't be far away. Hands up! Don't move! There he is! Stop! Or I'll shoot! Where have you got the money? - In the right pocket. - That supposed to be funny? - No, it was seven ?re. - Where's the money? - What money? - The money that was in there. - The big money? - Yes. - Well? - The little guy ran off with it.. - Where's the money? -O n the roof. - That's where I looked ... - Under the roof? Do you know what they do with robbers? You don't know? You must take off your shoes, to make you comfortable. There. Fine. All calm now. Uncle Tramp's going to teach the shoes to swim. Come here. Nothing to be afraid of! Rasmus! - Oskar! Oskar! - Where is he? - In the lake. - Mine's in the loft. He's tied up! - Serves him right! There it is! - Where've you put the necklace? Good. Sit there and close your eyes. - Why? I- 'm going to hide this stuff and I don't want you to know where. - Why not? - You never know when they'll turn up again. So I don't want you to know where I've hidden these things. Turn round! Close your eyes tight. - You're really clever, Oskar! But I'm pretty clever too! Hold on, wasn't he the one... - Who? - ... who robbed Mrs. Berggren? Wait here! No, not yet, but all the roads are blocked. Yes Yes. - The tramp and the kid are walking along ?gatan right now. - Andersson! The tramp is on ?gatan. Get a move on. - I think I've seen the robber. - Oh really. Why are they looking at us like that? - Yes, I was wondering that too. Here they come. Hands up! Search him for the gun. - Gun, gun,always a gun! I've never had a gun. - Why would you think he's got a gun! - Now you come along quietly. How on earth is a man supposed to be a tramp in this country? Any, what makes you think I had anything to do with it? That lovely and kind Mrs. Berggren. She's the nicest person I've ever met! - But you know a necklace was stolen? - Yes of course I do. And I know who stole it. - Really! - Yes! He's telling the truth! - The ones who stole the payroll at Sand?. - Now we're getting somewhere. - So it was you! - Do I look like two masked men? The newspaper said there were two masked men. And they took the necklace too. - We are completely innocent! - Well, that's what you say ...? And how do you know who stole the necklace? - Well, I was standing outside the house singing ... - Singing! - Yes, I was singing: Every forest maybe has its spring - Good song ... I was standing there singing, and then I saw them running from the house. - And one of them was hiding behind the curtain! I saw his boots! - And who might you be? We have a report here A report about a boy missing from the orphanage. - Where did I put it ... - The description seems to fit. Stop! - After him! Ahh, how nice to see you again! - Yes but we can't stay here. - Not a sound! - Come with us. Where's the money and the necklace? - I don't know! - Don't tell lies! - Oskar hid them and wouldn't let me see. - Oskar ... - The big fat one? - He's my partner. - Where is he? - He was taken by the police. - Why did they do that? - They think Oskar took the money and the necklace! - Well, when you stick your nose in other people's business ... - We have to sort this, and fast. - How long would it take? - Three minutes, more or less. - What's your name, my little friend? - Rasmus. - You want Oskar to be free? - Of course. - Thought so. Tonight, we'll talk to Oskar. He's probably in the house behind the police station. There's a barred window there. Tell him we'll help him get out if he shows us where he hid everything. If he co-operates, he keeps the necklace. We'll share like brothers. But remember: no tricks! At nine o'clock one of us will be here. You should have talked to Oskar by then. Meanwhile, you have to stay hidden here. Then they said you can keep the necklace as long as they get the money. You have to do it, Oskar, you really do! I only want us to be on the road again! - If you help crooks, you're a crook yourself. - I want us to be together. I just want to be with you, Oskar! - We'd get caught again. If only I could talk to the chief! Make him ubderstand! - It'll probably be hard to get anything into his skull. - Go back and talk to them. Pretend I said yes. Imagine outsiders like us getting to attend such a fun party! - But you live here, and besides, we get such wonderful fish every day. Where's Mr Liander got to? - He's gonet to post a letter. - Well, we've got him there! Were the perch rising? - Sorry? - The postbox is on the road and Mr Liander came from the river. - Ha-ha! A real Sherlock Holmes! - Yes indeed! - No, but the big pike is just waiting for us to pull him out. - We can't eat that! - No, but we can catch it! May I raise a glass to our Chief of Police? A great job! Well done! Here's to the arrest! - Thank you. - You're very capable! Captive in Elfsborg ... Hello, all you dummies! - Shut up! - I have to talk to the Chief of Police! - You can do that tomorrow. - I can't wait 'til tomorrow! I have to talk to him now! - Don't show yourself here. - He's safely locked up. He'll show us where the stuff is, then you'll get your money. How's the old lady? - She's coming to, it's dangerous. so I need to get out of here! - Be patient. Go on home. What a heat! We're going to have to get on our way. - You're not going? - I'm afraid so. - Thank you for a nice evening. - Already! The big pike is waiting. And one should always leave when the party's at its best. Good night. Thanks for tonight! Five ?re for your thoughts, Gerda. - Oh? - Lif the engineer is dangerous for you. - They're both sweet. Pity they're both leaving tomorrow. No, that way! - I must have my stuff. Hey! Who are these people? Andersson! Chief, the tramp has escaped! - What?! Is that the chief? - No, I couldn't get hold of him. - Then everything's going down the drain. - No, it was nothing. Come on. - Yes, now the chief has to take the blame. It's over there, under the stone. - What about the necklace, then? - It's not there. - Not there, eh? - I put it there myself ... - Maybe someone took it. - Maybe someone took it. Give it to me. Or there's going to be an accident. - Don't shoot! He doesn't know where it is! - Come here, you scoundrel! - Run, Rasmus! Run Now tell me where the necklace is! - Ouch! Let me go! Let go of the boy! Hooray! Hooray! let him have it! Let him have it! He's an idiot! Hooray for the police! Hooray for the police! Hooray for the police! - Was it you who took the necklace? - Yeah, who else? I'm pretty clever too! Here. I don't like guns. Isn't it there either? - Here it is. - You're all right, you are! - What's going on here ?! - There's a necklace going on here And as far as the money is concerned, these gentlemen know more than me. They're the ones who robbed Mrs.Berggren. - What? - And here's the money from the Sand? robbery. - Well, that was the most impudent thing I have ever experienced. - Let's get out of here! And to think I had dinner with you two! and toasted you for a good catch! Oskar, I can't go any further. I've had nothing to eat all day! - Those wretches! Didn't they give you any food? Here. have a sandwich. There'll be more as we get further along. - Should we run, or what? Are you afraid of the police? - Yes, scared they'll take you away from me and put you back in the orphanage. - You're scared of that? Then you like being with me? - Do I like being with my partner? Come here and sit down. - You should have a piece too, eh? What was that you said? - I said: Yes, I very much like being with my little partner. What if I was your own boy, Oskar! But you don't really want a tramp for a dad, do you? - Yes! But only a tramp like you! If only we had a real home. - But don't we have a lovely time? The forest and the road are our home. Yes, but in winter I want to stay in a cottage. I never have. Only the orphanage. - Yes ... we'll see. Right, we have to get going now. Don't forget your sandwich. Are we going to sing here? - Here you should sing very little ... - What do you mean? - Wait and see. So, you're home? - Yes... - And who's this? - I ... picked up a little kid along the way. But he's a very little kid, you'd hardly notice him. - Come on, let's go. How's it been for you all this time? - What do you think? Worn out from working day and night. And with no money. It's been .... awful. - Are you ... very angry with me? - Yes, I am. I'm so angry ... I could ... - I'm so glad you're home! - There's nobody like you, M?rta. - I don't know how you put up with me. This time I'm staying at home to work. I know, I've promised that before, but now I really mean it. - And I believe you every time, fool that I am. But hold on ... There's someone here who isn't so happy? Why such a sad little face? - This is Rasmus, my road partner. Strange fellow; he wants a tramp for a dad! - Indeed! Then you don't have much sense. - But with such a fine mother as you, no harm would come to him. Would you like me to be your mother, then? Would you like to stay here with us? - Stay here? Really live here? - Yes, in this little cottage. - In a real home? - Yes, even though that's not so obvious. But you'd get a real mother and a father, such as he is. - But do you want a boy with straight hair? - Do we! You're exactly what we imagined. Yes, it has to be a boy with straight hair, or no boy at all. - What about me? - I can't reach around you! - Rasmus, look. That's yours. - No ... - What if my dream's come true ...! I dreamt I had a father, a mother and a cat. Remember, Oskar? It's so wonderful that I have found my cat/i> I still have my old hat and the squeezebox. On a warm summer day We'll go out there and play and forget all our sorrows and troubles!
