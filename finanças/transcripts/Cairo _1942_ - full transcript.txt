Madam, would you mind putting your hat on? Thank you. - Homer. - Oh. You're wanted down at the newspaper office, right away. Wait till this number is over. You've seen this thing eight times, and it's three years old. This is the last picture Marcia Warren made in this country. See it again tomorrow night, but Mr. Boggs says you to come now. Oh, in a minute. He says, it's an emergency. Oh, alright. - Say, what is this all about? - You're a fine one to ask. - Homer, congratulations. - Well, Mr. Boggs... - I never was so tickled at all. - Will you, please... - Homer, we've made it. - Made what? - Mr. Boggs, you mean to say... - Sure, I mean it. The "Cavity Rock, California Times Leader" has been picked as America's most typical small town newspaper. - Oh, that means, t-that our... - Exactly, my boy. Hurray! Speech! Speech! Speech! Friends, friends. Quiet, just a minute, please. If I may be permitted to say a word? Go ahead. As editor and publisher of the "Cavity Rock, California Times Leader" it is my honor to announce to you that it has been selected by the Small Town Newspaper Association of the United States to supply to its fellow members a series of dispatches to be entitled "The small town looks at the war". Naturally, the author of these dispatches will be none other than that small town reporter our own, Homer Smith. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen... and friends. Uh, I want you to know, that I'll be on the job every minute. As your correspondent, it'll be my duty to get the story first... get all of it and get it right. The eyes of every small town in this country, will look to... As I was saying. The, um, eyes of every small town in this country... Ahoy. Ahoy. Um... ahoy. Small world, what? It looks pretty big from where I sit. Mind if I sit, where you sit? Getting a bit clammy down here. Oh, excuse me. Steady, grab it. Steady. There... now, we're cozy. Nice of you to have me. Formal to know that, the name's Cobson. Oh, I remember you. You're the fellow that got so excited when the convoy wouldn't stop at your Gibraltar. See, if they'd let you off, you'd have missed all this. Oh, nothing really, I'm an adventurer at heart. Me too. My name is Homer. Not really, I'd have sworn you were dead. Oh, you're thinking of the old Greek poet. He's dead. - My name is Homer Smith. - Oh. I'm from Cavity Rock, California. California, that's in America, isn't it? Just about the best part of it, that's all. - You're an Englishman, right? - How did you guess it? Well, I sort of train myself to notice things. - I'm a newspaper man. - Eh. Piece of chocolate? - Oh, thank you very much. - Not at all. - What do you do, Mr. Cobson? - Do, old chap? No, I mean, what's your profession? Oh, a little of this, a little of that. Not much of anything. Mm... that pipe sure smells good. Hmm. - Mr. Cobson. - Call me, Philo. - Why? - That's my name. My given name. No good being standoffish, right? We're in tight quarters. - Philo, where are we? - That's an odd question, Homer. I assume we're on the cold blue Mediterranean. Yes, but where on the Mediterranean? That's hard to say, really. What with one wave looking so much like another wave. Last I heard, we were hugging the Libyan coast. Which should be over there. Seems pretty far for a right close hug. I wish we had some sort of a sail. A sail? It seems to me, I recall hearing of a chap, you... I say, Homer, how about a puff of the old burner? - No, I don't wanna deprive you. - Nonsense, old beam, go ahead. Uh-huh, thank you. Seems to me this lad used himself as a mast put his coat on back, what he did, he tied the two ends to the gunnels of his little boat. - Ingenious, what? - Why not try it with me? Oh, how would it look, my sitting back enjoying the smoke. While you serve me as a bleeding mast. - Mr. Cobson. - Philo. - Philo, I insist. - I don't want to give offence. Take your coat off. If you don't mind, Homer? Point yourself just a shade to the South East. There, that does it, my bucko. I wish, I had my Piper Cub with me. Piper Cub? Pet animal, is it? No, it's an aeroplane. I'm not very good at it. I've only soared it, a couple of times. I'd like to be flying due East from here, right now. That's where I've got to get to, Cairo. It's Cairo for both of us, laddie. How do you like the Libyan desert? Weird what? I wonder if we're in friendly, or in enemy territory. We'll find out soon enough. There. Cleaned to the Queen's taste. Mind if I look at it? Outside of some ducks, I've never done very much shooting. Sure, handles nice. Watch what you're doing! Give me that gun. Put out that fire. - Who are you? - We are Italians, we surrender. But you can't surrender to us. We're not soldiers. But we do surrender. We don't want to capture you. What will we do with you? Turn us over to the British. Well, I never heard of such a thing. They're frightened, they must be British guns. There's your chance to surrender. Those are British guns. No, they're not. They're German. They mustn't catch us. German guns? That's not good for us, either. - We shouldn't get caught. - What do we do? - You got any money? - In my money belt. Stick to the shore. Buy your way, native to native. Don't flash any more money than you have to. We ought to separate? There's less chance being caught singly than together, right? Right, which way's the shore? I guess, I can't miss it. I'd lend you my automatic, but I may need it, heading inland. Yeah, sure. Well, Homer, nice knowing you and all that. - Look, Mr. Cobson. - Philo. Look, Philo, if you get through and I don't. Will you send a message for me to the "Cavity Rock Times Leader", Cavity Rock, California. Just say... well, just say, "When you last saw me I was getting the story first, right, and all of it." Stout fellow. You can do the same for me, Homer. Just name it, Philo. - Now, listen carefully. - Mm-hm. If and when you get to Cairo. Go to the Viceroy Hotel at precisely 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Go to the bar. There you'll find a woman drinking a rainbow cocktail with two cherries in it. Put that book and pencil away, you've got to remember it. That woman's name is Mrs. Morrison. - Oh, what does she look like? - I don't know, I never met her. Once you've established her identity, you'll say, in exactly these words: "Every precaution must be taken. We cannot afford to fail." Every precaution must be taken. We cannot afford to fail. - Right. - Boy, what a story. - Wait 'till I get this on the wire. - This is one story you can't print. I know you're a newspaper man, but you can't have this story, yet. - Why not? - Because... Because... well, you'll know sooner or later. I happen to be a member of British Intelligence. O-o-oh. Well, then this-this must be some kind of espionage. In a way. - What kind of spies? - Well, ah, saboteurs. Group of Nazi agents, known to the FBI and us as the Big Six. They operate in and about Cairo. Their leader is a woman. Well, what kind of sabotage are they working at? I can't tell you anymore. This is a vital and important mission. The eyes of my country and yours are on you, Homer. - Keep your wit sharp. - I'll do my best. Right. Chin up, old chap. Oh, Phil... Sure wish, I knew, what a rainbow cocktail was. Oh, I beg your pardon. Pardon me, but... ...is that a rainbow cocktail with two cherries in it? What if it is? Well... if, if it is, eh, is your name Morrison? - What if it is? - Well, is it? Well, suppose we call the house detective and let him decide. You've got me all wrong. I-I was suppose to... Will I call him or will you? Well... I guess, I... must be a little confused. - Give me a beer, please. - Yes, sir. - Your beer, sir. - Well, thank you. By the way, do you know a woman around here who always orders a rainbow cocktail with two cherries in it? Many of our clients drink their rainbows with two cherries. Particularly, women. - Oh, I see. Thank you. - Not at all, sir. Rainbow, please. With two cherries. Rainbow with two cherries. Just like always, eh, Mrs. Morrison? - Morrison? Morrison? - Where did you get that pipe? Why didn't you tell me who you were? Where did you get that pipe? Mr. Cobson, forgot it when we were separated on the desert. How we got separated is, we were ship wrecked. - Where is Cobson? - I don't know. The reason we separated, is that if I got on alone. - I was to give you a message. - Alright, give it to me. There isn't very much to it. He told me to tell you, quote "Every precaution must be taken. We cannot afford to fail." Unquote. What I really want to know... - Is that all? - Well, just about. Oh, I see. Well, Mister... - What is the name? - Eh, Smith. Homer Smith. I'm a newspaper man. - Did Cobson know that? - Oh, sure. But I told him I wouldn't write the story, yet. Especially, after he told me who he was. He told you who he was? - British Intelligence. - Oh. Well, it wasn't very intelligent of that Briton, I must say. An American newspaper man, of all people. Mrs. Morrison, I can't say, I don't want this story. I do. It's a great one, and I've got it first. But I want it right and all of it. British Intelligence has your word? I won't write a line till it's over. - But then, I want it. - It's a bargain. Now, Mr. Smith. If there's any little thing I can do for you... There is something I would like. - I would like. - Yeah? To know the name of the woman who heads the Big Six. The leader of the Big Six? Mr. Smith, that's impossible. - Even we only suspect her. - I promised I won't use it. We'd like to help you keep your promise. Can't you give me some leads, something to start on? Perhaps, I can help you make sure. I've got to get to work. Well, I suppose after all we do owe you a great deal. Are you fond of music, Mr. Smith? Well, I'm sort of musical. W-what's that got to do? - Lovely, isn't she? - Oh, sure, she is. - That's Marcia Warren. - Mm-hm. If I were you, I'd start following my lead in that room. You mean... Oh, why, that's ridiculous. Marcia Warren, the movie star? Oh, she can't be... Why, I've been a fan of hers for years. - Firstly, I didn't say she was. - No, but to even suspect her. And secondly, as a writer and a man of imagination, Mr. Smith. If you were to spy and you wanted a profession that would give you freedom of movement and access to important men, with important information. Yeah, being a beautiful movie star would be ideal. But Marcia Warren. Why, she's American... As a matter of fact, she's been out of the country for three years, ever since she made that picture in England. I'd be very careful, Mr. Smith. Very careful. For more reasons than one. I'll be careful, alright. I'll get on this, right away. If you, pardon me, Miss Morr... - Oh, you Americans. - See you later, Mrs. Morrison. Wonderful! Marvelous! Marcia, won't you give us just one more round? Just one. Thank you. I'd love to, but I really can't. It's 6 now, and I've gotta sing at the RAF at 8 and then over back here, for the victory ball at 10. Sorry, I just can't possibly, tomorrow I've got... - What do I've to do tomo... - Tomorrow, you've a busy day, rehearsing for the Native Festival. Yes, and-and isn't tomorrow the day for our-our weekly change of butlers or something? Yes, I've ordered a whole batch of 'em to report at 10 a.m. Thank you, Miss Warren. You were delightful. - Cleo? - I'm right here, Ms. Marcia. I'm in good voice this morning. Did you hear me? Couldn't help, but not without leaving Egypt. ♪ Not a thought, not a care, with a heart, debonair ♪ ♪ I pray you'll see ♪ ♪ Like a lock in the door. In the door must be gone ♪ ♪ Do I sing merrily? ♪ ♪ So clean, so now bring ♪ ♪ Bring the towel please ♪ ♪ From the rack over there ♪ ♪ Yes, Miss Marcia, I'll bring the towel to you ♪ Darlin', I'm getting tired of bathing in a swimming pool. Something indecent about it. I had such a cozy, little bathtub in Beverly Hills. The acoustics were better too. Hot water ran, hot. The cold water ran, cold. Everything worked the way it was suppose to. I want to go home. That was the trouble with America. It was too mechanized. It was... what was it doing to your soul? Stifling it. Yeah, you couldn't sing, because you didn't suffer. Why did you have to come all the way to Europe just to suffer? You thought doing a picture in England was a very good idea. Then, that awful summer. Oh! The trouble you had getting to the south of France, no director in Hollywood could get you to do a gig without a double. The Nazis have chased me out for the last time. There's only one place I'll run to from here on. That's Beverly Hills, California. I'll settle for Harlem, Basin Street, Central Avenue and all points in between. Amen, sister. I want to go home. Where a gas station looks like the Taj Mahal. And a restaurant looks like a hat. I've been away long, as soon as you, Miss Marcia. I miss everything, you miss. - Plus... - Plus what? A nice colored boy who speaks something besides French or goes around in a night gown in which case he turns out to be an Arab. But how about picking yourself out a new butler? The downstairs hall is full of them. You better come look. Alright. There they are. Look at that one in the middle. How did he get in there? He belongs in "Goodbye, Mr. Chips." Have him come up and tell rest to wait. Alright. The young gentleman in the middle. The one under the hat. That's right. Do you speak English? Oh, rather. That's all we need. Would you please, come upstairs? The rest of you gentlemen can wait. - Miss Warren, will see you. - Thank you. - English? - Rather. Why do I ask silly questions? Sit down please. The young man is here, Miss Marcia. Oh, alright. - How do you do? - How do you do? Have you been in service long? All rather. - Who was your last employer? - I beg your pardon, old boot. Um. Your last employer. - Who was he? - Lord Cobson. Lord Philo Cobson. Oh, oh, Cobby. Dear, dear, old Cobby. We're very good friends, you know? Tell me, how are the twins? Oh, just, uh... Oh, fine, top... hold, ripping. Who do you think you're kidding, bub? - Kidding? - Oh. Stop it. You're awful. If there's anything you learn from making musical pictures it's how to recognize bad acting. Sit down. Tell me now. What made you think I'd be insane enough to think you were British? Why, I thought that there'll be a chance of getting the job. Why do you want it? Hard up. Is that it? - You in any trouble? - No. No. No. Don't lie to me. Someone in the British Intelligence is a very good friend of mine. - She is? - He is. So, you're thousands of miles from home and broke. Yes. That's it alright. I thought so. Tell me Mr., uh... Jones. Oh. Couldn't you do better than that? You might as well as said, Smith. No. It is Jones. Juniper Jones. Tell me, Mr. Jones. What part of America are you from? California. Well. - Southern California? - No. Northern California. Oh. - What do you mean, oh? - I mean, oh. You're from Northern California, not Southern California. You sound as if there was something wrong about coming from Northern California, instead of Southern California. Oh, I didn't say that. It's that I live in Southern California. You mean, being a movie actress, you work there? - I also live there. - Because you work there. It's not uncommon, you know. For people to live where they work. I just said that, because if you didn't have to live in Southern California, you wouldn't. I happen to like Southern California. Have you ever been in Northern California? Look. Mr. Jones. I have a charming home in Beverly Hills. True, I work there, but even if I didn't, I'd live there. I like Beverly Hills. Do you mind? Have you ever been in San Francisco? Yes. Once, with Gable and Tracy. And the joint fell apart. Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine. Day in and day out. It stupefies your brain. It thins out your blood. It withers everything it touches. - Hasn't withered Lana Turner. - No. Southern California, the desert of human thought. Fruit without flavor. Flowers that don't smell. You don't have that trouble up north. Everything smells. Fog, fog, day in and day out. Straightens out your hair like it had been pressed. Fog in your lungs. Fog in your clothes. - Dripping off the building. - It's romantic. What's romantic about not being able to see your hand in front of your face? Can't tell whether you're on the street or a Turkish bath. Frisco, huh! You can have it. Don't you call it Frisco. It's San Francisco. - Frisco! - San Francisco! - Frisco! - San Francisco! - Frisco! - San Francisco! You gentlemen, can all return to the central casting. We've got just the man we've been looking for. Cavity Rock? What is it, an uncharted Island? Navy has checked it against everything in the Red Sea Mediterranean area, sir. No luck. - Nothing on it, in our files? - Not a thing, sir. Certainly is strange. Are you sure the man's Cobson? As sure as I can be, sir. Why on earth would a top flight Nazi agent, try to decode a song by Marcia Warren? Why be engaged by her as a butler? He's obviously after something, sir. Yes. But what? What would Marcia Warren, of all women... - Fin Tan. - Yes, sir. Get Miss Marcia Warren on the telephone for me, will you? Yes, sir. You say, Miss Warren engaged Cobson, personally? She interviewed him alone. I could hear their voices but not what they said. They seem to know each other. This gets stranger every minute. - Miss Warren is out, shopping. - Thank you. What makes you think they knew each other? They started to quarrel almost instantly. - They were still at it I left. - Hmm. You keep your eye on Cobson. I'll call Miss Warren this evening and have a talk with her. - Shall I arrest him, sir? - Oh, no, no. Get in touch with Egyptian authority to find out what passport, and what name he's using. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. Cavity Rock. Vases are kinda cute. Bet I can pick 'em up for a song. Who cares if they don't fit an early American powder room? I'll bet no early American, ever heard of a powder room. After all, it is something to be able to wave casually to a pair of lamps and just sort of let slip, that you... ...picked them up in Cairo... Yes? I, uh, was looking for some objects of art with a view to... Oh-oh. Ah! Are you in the habit of screaming a perfect high C? I-I have every reason to scream. And I don't scream flat. Are you in the habit of letting those little beasts run all over your customers? I prefer them to most of my customers. - What can I do for you, Madam? - Oh, nothing. Thank you. This isn't the YWCA, is it? - Hardly. - No, I thought not. Good day. Mr. Smith? Oh, Mrs. Morrison. - What are you doing here? - This will hand you a laugh. Well, I can use one. I've been following the leader of the Big Six. - Who? - Marcia Warren. I was trailing her, and she nearly caught me. I ducked into this shop, and she followed me in. Luckily, she got scared by a couple of mice and screamed. - Oh, she screamed, did she? - Like an air-raid siren. Hmm. Well, I imagine, when a singer screams she usually screams in a pretty high note, huh? Oh, I was too scared to notice. - What are you doing here? - Oh, I often come in here. It's an interesting place, isn't it? It sure is. It's got secret panels. Really? See those butterflies back there? Well. What about them? Well, they open up just like... a door. Well, I... At least, I thought they did. The Orient is getting you down. Tell me, how is your story progressing? Oh, I'll get it, alright. You know, uh... I'm Marcia Warren's butler now. - You are? - That's why I was following. - Keep track of her movements. - Well. You're in a better position than any of us to get information. You know we've tried to get a man under her house and you succeeded where we failed. Oh, just luck, that's all. You hurry back, before she misses you. When am I gonna see you, and get more of my story? It won't be long now, Mr. Smith. - And remember... - I know. I know. You want it all. You want it right. - And you want it first. - That's right. - Well, good bye, Mrs. Morrison. - Right. Tuning fork. Butterfly panels that open like doors. Tell me something? How can a tuning fork and a screaming woman open the door? By emitting the same note. In this case, the note of high C. It is a simple device, used commercially all over the world. Sound filter. It rejects all sounds, except one. Which is then properly amplified and converted into electrical energy. There upon, it opens the door. Well, I know a much better device. Yes? A door knob. - Well? - You heard the conversation. It's the young idiot who brought the message from Cobson. You out of your mind? How could you let him out? I'm more interested in the panel popping open. Just because that woman screamed a high C... I can't see any reason why we don't go in and out of doors like ordinary people. If it goes wrong, thank that Arabian Wizard of Oz upstairs. My dear lady. Tomorrow night we'll see your mission completed successfully. You will owe everything to Ahmed Ben Hassan. For without him, you couldn't possibly succeed. Now, forget your feminine distaste for what you don't understand long enough to tell us, what conceivable advantage was there in not killing the young man. We only have 36 hours to wait. He'll keep quiet that long. And after that? - We'll discuss it, then. - We'll discuss it, now. 'Will he be killed tomorrow night?' I will see to it... myself. What is it this time, Ahmed? Another experiment? Not an experiment. A cold fact. The object on the alter is a block of finely tempered steel. Such as is used in the construction of battleships or troop transports. Any American troop transport in particular? The plane, is a miniature, of the one I'm assembling out at the pyramid. It is radio controlled. I should've thought you oughta be able to operate it with a harmonica. You must imagine the top of the alter as the Suez Canal. The block is highly magnetized. This is synchronized with the radio control of the plane. At a predetermined point, in the volume of the magnetic field. - The plane'll strike the ship. - Very thoughtful of you, Ahmed. A preview, as it were, what will happen tomorrow night. If any part of the plane, hits the ship, it'll blow it to bits. The wings, fuselage, even the propeller hubs. - Will be impregnated with... - With what? If I told you that, the war will be over. And you would have won it. And the history of the world would become the history of Germany. It seems to be the general idea sooner or later. - Are we long to wait, Ahmed? - Not too long. Let me know the outcome. I have an appointment. Sit down. I don't see, why I need to watch this trick? - Sit down. - I've been sent by Germany to assist in the destruction of an American troop transport. And the sabotage of the Suez canal. I'd give my life to succeed. I believe our way is right. That our race and our nation must control the world. But I cannot reconcile that belief to dependence on a Mongol Oriental to win our victories for us. I said, sit down. And now, with your permission. No? Watch the plane. Amazing. Now. - Bravo, Ahmed. - It is still smoldering .

See you tomorrow night at the festival. - Bye. - Goodbye. Recess boys. We'll take up the rest later. Help yourself to some food. I see, the music got to you a little, Juniper. It certainly did, Miss Warren. Oh, sit down. They're the most beautiful songs of all to me. Because they are not just music, they say something. Something personal. To you, to me. Every other American. They tell us about home. I've got to ask you something I can make heads or tails of. What is it? It didn't make sense when I first heard it. And then it did. The reason a phone rings is so that a butler knows when to answer it. And then, it didn't make sense again. And then, it did. And now, it doesn't, again. Neither do you. What are you driving at? Firstly, I've got to tell you that... Miss Warren, it's Madam Laruga. Well, it's about time. You can tell me later, Juniper. Madame, where on earth are those prints? I simply got to have them for tomorrow night. Well, what good will that do? There isn't time. If those prints aren't right, everything will be ruined. The dresses are already finished. They're on their way to you. Uh, it was a difficult pattern. Oh, not at all, the designs were very simple. No, I don't carry them with me. And I haven't got them handy, they're upstairs in my desk. It's too late for that, now. What good will that do? Hmm, no, thank you, no potatoes. I said, no thank you, no potatoes. - No potatoes? - No potatoes. Oh, no potatoes... Juniper. Mm-hmm, oh. Tell me, do you drink an awful lot? I never touch alcoholic liquor. Uh, I'm down here, Juniper. Oh. Is everything... I mean there's no chance of the message not getting over. Message? And the prints, they're okay too, I suppose. Oh, the prints. Perfect. Just exactly, what I needed. Hmm. It certainly is nice out tonight, Miss Warren. Heavenly, Juniper. Heavenly. You know, what I'd do if I had a concert tomorrow night? No. What? Take a nice long walk, tonight, get my lungs full of fresh air. As a matter of fact, I always do that, in the morning. Night air is supposed to be bad for you, you know. Oh, that's just an old superstition. In the daytime, the air is full of dust and carbon monoxide. At night, it's clean... and fresh. - Full of romance and moonlight. - Mm-hmm. How soon will you be through with the dishes, Juniper? Oh! I really... Uh, it wouldn't look right for you to go walking with a butler. You are no butler. Well, I think, Cleo ought to go with you. But the cook will be out, there will be no one, but you. Well, I'm no thief, Miss Warren. Frankly, Juniper, I'm going nearly crazy trying to figure out just what you are. I'm just doing my job, that's all. Well, perhaps, you're right. Certainly, it's too nice a night to waste entirely. Tell Cleo, she's to go walking with me after dinner. Yes, ma'am. Uh, a nice long walk. Why is it better for a woman to go walking with their maid, than with their butler? Because a maid is a female, and the butler is a male. Sometimes, I wonder about that too. Colonel Woodhue is here, Miss Warren. Colonel Woodhue? - That will be all, Juniper. - Yes, ma'am. He don't know nothing about the movies or he'd have landed smack in them mashed potatoes. Are you hurt, Juniper? No. Tell the colonel to come in. I am in. Good evening, Miss Warren. How do you do, Colonel? It's so nice to see you. Bring the colonel chair, Cleo. Sorry to interrupt your dinner but I did want to see you. Oh, not at all. Sit down. Won't you have something to eat? No, I've had wine. That takes care of my manners. Yes. Let me guess, what you want to see me about? Yes, I'd be happy to sing for the soldiers. Where and when? We don't bother asking you anymore, Miss Warren. We just assign you. Matter of fact, I've come on pretty serious business. I'll do anything I can to help, the more serious the better. No, thank you, Juniper. No salad. I said no salad, Juniper. Thank you. Oh. You may take the things away, Juniper. Yes, ma'am. Juniper, he's new, isn't he? Juniper Jones, brand new. - An odd name. - A phony. But he's an American and obviously hard up. So, I gave him the job. Is that all you know about him? Well, he's not too bright. But he's kind of cute. Very attentive. - I should think, he would be. - Do you know him? - Know of him? - Well, tell me. Come, now, it isn't exactly tea-table gossip. Oh, now, don't tell me Juniper's a Jap. Not a bad guess. I, uh, I don't suppose you ever heard of Philo Cobson? Philo Cobson? - Lord Philo Cobson? - What about him? Juniper's former employer. Why, that's odd. Not only odd, but very stupid of him. We've, uh, we've reason to believe... ...that Juniper Jones is Philo Cobson. - But he's not English. - Whatever his nationality. We suspect him to be Philo Cobson. A well known and dangerous Nazi agent. - Are you sure? - Reasonably sure. We're checking up on him, now. Oh! Oh-h! So, that's why night air is better than day air. That's why it wouldn't be right for a butler to... Colonel Woodhue. He's trying to get Cleo and me to leave him alone. Which you must not do under any circumstances. But what shall I do? I haven't played many spy parts. Well, first and most important you must get him out of the house, tonight. And while he's gone, search his room. I see. I should do to him what he was gonna do to me. You're the only one that can. This will mean a great deal... Uh, will you have some coffee, colonel? Thank you, no. I must be getting along. Oh. If you've got any doubts, watch him react to this. One thing about the German language it's certainly easy to recognize. - Does it sound familiar? - Not to me. And no coffee, thank you, Juniper. Uh, Juniper's an odd name, isn't it? It sure is. It's gotten a lot colder out here, hasn't it? - Uh, Cleo. - Yes, Miss Marcia? Please send Juniper to the store for something. - For what? - I don't know. What do we need? Nothing and the stores are all closed. He's too smart, anyway. He'll find an excuse to stay in. Is that bad? Oh, don't ask me why, Cleo, but... ...he's gotta be out tonight and we gotta be in. We'll go out. Let him be in? No, that's just exactly what he wants. He won't go out, if we don't go out. We can't go out if he doesn't go out. If we won't go out unless he goes out, maybe, he'll go out. Miss Warren, I think, you better take a nice warm bath and lay down. Cleo. I've got it. I've got it! - Juniper. - Yes, ma'am. Uh, would you like to go see a show? I think, that'd be very nice, Miss Warren. Good. Here's the money, you go get the tickets. I'm sorry, Miss Warren, I couldn't think of you paying. - Oh, don't be silly. - I insist. Well, it's awfully nice of you. Not at all. Pardon me. - What is he doing, Miss Warren? - I don't know. Looks like, he's trying to commit hara-kiri. Uh, have you an old operation that's bothering you? Oh, it's my money belt, I keep my money in it. Well, that settles it. If I met a stranger who wore a money belt I'd know he was a spy. Alright, alright, alright. I'm sorry, Miss Warren I guess, you'll have to loan me the money, after all. I haven't any more Egyptian money and I have only... ...$100 bills in my money belt. Imagine, nothing to your name, but a belt full of c-notes. C-notes? They're $100 bills. They're also called yards. That's, uh, gangster language. Ah-oh! Well, I, uh, I think, I prefer c-notes. It's, uh, more my type. Don't you think? - Here you are. - Thank you. C-notes? No wonder he carries 'em in his girdle. So would I. - Uh, is everything alright? - Oh, yes. The way she looked at me, you would've thought I was a spy. - Imagine. - Silly, isn't it? What's a spy? Uh, well... Miss Warren, I just remembered I forgot to get your wrap for tomorrow night. Oh, how could you do a thing like that? I better get to a phone, right away. Oh, by all means. Is there a telephone handy? Oui, madame, in the ladieslounge. Come, I'll show you. - We'll only be a moment. - Yes, ma'am. Look, when those two ladies I was with come back tell them, uh, tell them I was sick and had to leave. The young man who came with the two ladies. You have to tell that they took suddenly ill and had to leave. - Hmm, epidemic. - Who? Oh, this is exasperating. Whenever I have a scene like this in a picture the first window is always open. - Can't we use the front door? - Oh, no, we'd be seen. I'm sure he's got somebody watching us. Darn it! There goes a nail. I don't leave any windows open. I keep this place locked like a tomb. Suppose, you've gotta key to the back door. No, you've got a key, and it's to the front door. Miss Warren, look. When I die, I want you to lock up my tomb. And I'll be sure to come back and haunt you. Don't step on any lights. I hope his door is unlocked. What's that? That silly cat must have sneaked in the house with us. I hope. - Nothing to be scared about. - Isn't there? Yes, there is. I'm scared stiff, but I'm going in anyway. You wait here and watch. - Watch what? - Oh, anything. Uh, Miss Warren, I've got a confession to make. I'm the biggest coward in the world. No, you're not. You're next to the biggest. Oh! - Did you... - Oh! - Did you ring? - No, I did not ring. Help me up, will you. That darn clock! - What is that, Miss Marcia? - It's an identification card. - Why, that's him. - Yes, but it's not his card. This card belongs to Homer Smith. How come? I know. Spy's do that all the time. That's how they collect false identification. Do you mean to say... I mean to say that Juniper probably murdered Homer Smith. Juniper's a killer. Why ain't we on our way to some place else? - Oh! - What's the matter? - I thought I heard something. - Oh, silly, come on. Miss Marcia? Miss Marcia? I thought I heard something, Cleo. I think I thought I heard something, Cleo. Cleo? Cleo? Oh! T-this is loaded. And-and I know, how to use it. If-if you've any doubts, just start something. I don't doubt you at all. Then, stay where you are. Have you a woman accomplice with you? Not that I know of. This room positively reeks of cheap, vulgar perfume. Well, it's yours. Oh. I spilled it on me. - Bless you. - Thanks. I guess, I must be catching cold, I'm... ...soaking wet. I haven't that much perfume. No, it's from standing under the shower. - With your clothes on? - Well, I was putting out the fire. What fire? - The one I started in here. - The shower's not in here. No, I carried the fire into the bathroom. I see. I think it's about time you stop kidding me, Mr. Cobson. - Who? - Should I say, "Herr Cobson"? - I'm not Cobson. - Juniper Jones, perhaps. - No. - I suppose it's, Homer Smith. - How did you know? - I thought you'd pull that one. Well, whatever your name, Mr. Cobson, Smith, Jones. The jig is up. You stay there. - Wait a minute. - Well. I'll have you know that on behalf of the American public the ones that go to the movies, that is. That you're not only betraying your country, but them also. What? Go ahead, turn me over to the Nazis. I'll a lot rather die as a hick newspaper man than live as a famous Nazi movie star. - Bless you. - Thanks. I-I, uh, wonder how long you think you can keep up this pretense? Think, you can confuse me by calling me a Nazi, you Nazi! Don't you call me a Nazi, you Nazi. You're Philo Cobson. - British Intelligence said so. - That's a lie! British Intelligence says, you head the Big Six. - What's the Big Six? - Oh, as if you didn't know. You mean, you're not Philo Cobson? Oh, Cobson, Cobson, I wish, I'd never let him on my raft. On, your raft? That's where I met him, on a raft in the Mediterranean. Tell me honestly. Are you Yahudi? Ha-ha-ha. I'm Homer Smith from Cavity Rock, California. Ha-ha-ha. I work for the "Times Leader". I've got papers to prove it. I've got my driver's license and my social security number. Then who is Cobson? He's from British Intelligence. He told me so himself. Where? On that raft? No, just after we captured the Italian soldiers. That's it, brother. - Stay here. - What are you gonna do? - Phone British Intelligence. - You wouldn't dare. - Bless you. - Thanks. Could I have a blanket, I'm getting a chill. Well, certainly. Thanks. Who is the Governor of California known as Sunny Jim? Ralph. Describe the Los Angeles River. It's dusty. Where are the highest and lowest points in The United States? California, Mount Whitney and Death Valley. - Bless me. - Thanks. Look, Juniper, uh, Homer. I'm not a spy, believe me. In the first place, The Screen Actors Guild wouldn't stand for it. Well, what about tomorrow night? Tomorrow night? You mean the Native Festival? You're gonna sing a song with a message in it? A message? Oh, that. Well, you got that yourself this afternoon. You got sad because the song made you think of America and home. What about Madame Laruga and the prints? Madame Laruga is my dress maker. She's making me print dresses which I may or may not wear tomorrow night. Oh. Well, do you think I'm a spy? Right now, Junip, uh, Homer, I wouldn't think you were a spy if I personally caught you going through President Roosevelt's pockets. - Well, somebody is. - Yes, I have no doubt of that. Right now, we better leave that to Colonel Woodhue to find out. Chill's getting worse. You're sick. You better go to bed. I'll get you some aspirin. I can feel my heart beating way up to my head. Oh, you've got fever. Your hand sure feels cool. - Miss Warren. - Hmm. I must be delirious or something because if... ...I was normal, I wouldn't have the nerve but... ...more than anybody else, I'm glad you're not a spy. Oh, that's a very nice compliment, Homer. Well, it's the truth. I was almost sick thinking about it. - Were you? - You see, you used to be... - Yes... - I mean... Yes, Homer. - Well, I was always... - Yes, Homer. - I mean, I thought about it. - Yes. - It was a... - Yes. Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

The Central Avenue Social and Easy Introduction Club. - Central Avenue, Los Angeles? - Where else? Why, I belong to the Lunds Avenue branch, myself! You can't be no make believe. You don't feel like no dream. But what you doing in them togs? I've been living in the desert for four years. - Long way from Central Avenue. - You're tellin' me. You see, I wasn't doing so good back there, except the movies. There wasn't an Arab picture shootin', I didn't play Arab. The only time I was eatin', was when I was being an Arab. So, I said to myself, Hector, that's my name, Hector. Maybe, you are Arab at heart, and you just won't give in. So, I gave in. I beat the way over here, and here I am. - Now, you eating regular. - No, not all the time. It must be their religion or something. Fasting's going on night and day. And when they do eat, I can't eat it. Being an Arab ain't much fun. Seeing you tonight was the big convincing. Maybe, you've been missing more than you know.

You carry them with you everywhere? Almost. I've been meaning to come back to that shop of yours. It's a very interesting place. Are those, uh, butterflies still for sale? They've been sold. Oh, that's too bad. Well, I may come back tomorrow anyway and bring some of my friends. My humble shop will be honored. - What kept you so long? - One of my white mice. White mice. If you were efficient you'd teach them to sing in high C and save the expense of a tuning fork. Yes, I'm a great lover of animals. But we have very little time. Can we continue this conversation on the way to the pyramid? I had a very interesting talk with your young newspaper man. Him? I thought he was gonna be taken care of tonight. - He will be, when our job's done. - I don't like him snooping around. He isn't snooping, and I'm not interested in your dislikes. He is snooping. He intends to visit my shop tomorrow with some friends. We take care of the young man and the young lady. The little they know is too much, but in the meantime... - Let's get out of the pyramid. - Exactly. What now? Is another one of your mice loose, running along behind? No. Everything is just what I want it to be. Cleo? Cleo? Have you heard anything from Mr. Smith? - No, isn't he with you? - No. I've looked everywhere for him, he just disappeared. Well, you suppose something's happened? Of course, he's not come back, that's all. - Your bag, Miss Warren. - My bag? - Yes, you're still holding it. - Oh, yeah, yes. I'm always left holding the bag. I should have known it was too good to be true. Cleo, I've broken it to bits. For goodness sake. What? This looks like a map, with triangles on it. Isn't that odd? There's something else. If Mr. Smith is Mr. Cobson that sure is a awful picture of Mr. Smith. This isn't Mr. Smith. Isn't anything like him. Homer isn't Cobson, Homer is Homer. And if Homer is Homer, he's in trouble. Get Colonel Woodhue on the phone. Oh, never mind, I'll get it, I'll get it. Maybe, it's Homer. Hello. Hello, Homer? Uh? Oh! Oh, Colonel Woodhue. Oh, oh, Colonel Woodhue, I was just going to call you. Yes, I wanna see you, right away. Bravo, Ahmed. You promised us a plane and behold, a plane. Get the canvas off, start the motors and then come down to the car. Amazing what you archaeologists can do. Some packing cases full of supplies and perfectly camouflaged among those old ruins. Oh, it wasn't very difficult to assemble a plane. Give the necessary parts and enough help. As one who can't even drive a nail into a wall my respect for you increases every minute. Doesn't yours, my dear? I respect only results. Is the plane ready to take off? Fully loaded and ready. It will not land until it hits the side of the troop transport. An obsolete bombing plane in exchange for 5000 American troops. What a bargain! If none of this hocus pocus goes wrong. None of it will go wrong. Well? The tuning fork is cold. Rub it in your hands. The note must be exactly on pitch. As long as I live, high C will remain in my memory. I bet there's another high C Ahmed will never forget. Nor will I ever forget the woman who sang it. And the idiot who stood at the butterfly panel. Everything in it's time, Ahmed. Let's attend to the business in hand. - Good luck. - Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. I hope you have enjoyed your trip. Don't move. Stay where you are. Still getting your story, Mr. Smith? I'd like you to meet some other members of the British Intelligence. I've been a dope long enough. Anybody with half a brain could have seen you were a Nazi. How fortunate for us that you have such a limited supply. It would be better to attend to him inside the tomb. We have no time to waste in disposing of a body out here. You'll come with us, please. Wait. - I want to talk you, over here. - Oh. Wait a minute. I don't like leaving, Mr. Smith alone. He's a very inquisitive young man. He knows better than to run away. Oh, I don't know. By his own admission, he's not very bright. What could he possibly do? Make a dash for the plane? Come. Can you think of a more ingenious way of killing a man than in a radio controlled plane? Now, we will overtake him. There's no doubt about it. This is a map indicating the pyramid we've been hunting for months. The car with Mr. Smith on it was headed that way, sir. - What are we waiting for? - Come along. Have you the plane under control? Not yet. Now. This is incredible. There's no apparent way into the pyramid. There must be. They're in there and they've got Homer with them. How did they get in? Obviously, through this side there are car tracks and footprints that lead right here. Couldn't you blow a hole into it? Yes, as soon as I get some dynamite. - But that won't be tonight. - This is odd. - The men found a $100 bill. - $100 bill? It must be Homer's. - He had some in his money belt. - He must have lost it. Miss Warren? Miss Warren? If it isn't about the pyramid don't bother me. It ain't exactly that but it makes an Arab's life attractive. - What does? - These grow on the desert. I just found out I've been livin' in a wrong neighborhood. Yes, me and Hector decided we'll stay and dig for money. Well, I hope you'll be very happy. C notes? C notes? The one we've found has your name on. See here. What? He must have dropped that as a message to you. I thought you said he lost them. So, he's not smart, huh? - He's just a small town hick. - I didn't say that. No, I know, you didn't, I did. Stand back everybody, I'm gonna sing a C. Oh, really Miss Warren, I don't think... Well, I'll try it an octave higher. You see? Well, th-there is still high C. That's apparently that. Sorry, Miss Warren. Ordinarily, I wouldn't have admit this but I was a little flat that time. Now. Oh, no. Walls of Jericho. Uh, it has reached the magnetic field. - The transport? - Yes. Now, we'll straighten him out. Now, he'll fly like an arrow to his death. Where is Homer? Oh, Homer? Is this something you've lost? Oh, let me at her, will you? Yes, let her at me. I've picked up a Jerry light bomber, send the alert. He's just below us, lads. Let's get at him. I'm awfully glad we gave this party for the boys, aren't you? They're such fun. Hmm. Well, you might be a little more enthusiastic about it. After all, you did risk your life to see it. I'm enthusiastic. Oh, co-starring. That's what it says. I don't know what to do in front of a camera. Oh, darling, you'll be surprised how quickly you'll find out. Now, suppose we're in a shot together. It's a close shot, of just the two of us. - There's the camera, there. - Yeah. Now, what would you do, if, uh... ...if I were to back up like this? Well, I'd turn around to look at you. Well, you wouldn't be a co-star very long, darling. - No? - No. You've got back of your head to the camera, see? Oh. - Well, suppose I did this. - Move out of my close up. No, darling. We'll always play our close shots profile-to-profile. - What about when we kiss? - No difficulty at all. Of course, in the picture, I'll have my face nearer the camera because I'm your wife and I love you. Well, get your hand down, you're spoiling my close up. ♪ Keep the light in the bay, burning bright ♪ ♪ Like a far reaching star in the harbor ♪ ♪ Let it shine ♪ ♪ Let it shine ♪ ♪ Till the world of marching men ♪ ♪ All come sailing home again ♪ ♪ Keep a light burning bright till then ♪
