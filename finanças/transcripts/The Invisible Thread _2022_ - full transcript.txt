MY FAMILY IN COLOUR BY FERRARI & VENOSA 3°C, G. MARCONI INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL This is me, Leone. And this is my father, Simone. Simone is an anthropologist, but he gave up his university career to manage a restaurant in the city where the food is great. He's funny, sporty, confident, and he's taught me a lot of things. I'll shove that thing down your throat, understand? [Leone] And this is Paolo, my other dad. Paolo is an architect with great ambitions, but he, too, has put them aside for the time being to focus on his furniture shop. But he encourages me every day to pursue my dreams. But let's go back in time, to before I was even born. Paolo and Simone were two lovers who had been together for five years and felt ready to start a family. Enough! [Leone] Unfortunately, in Italy, a family like theirs doesn't have the right to adopt a child. But then everything changed when they met her. [screaming] -[Leone] This is Tilly. -[baby crying] [Leone] Simone met her at the University of California. When he and Paolo told her about what they wanted to do… SURROGATE MOTHERHOOD …she immediately offered to help them. And thanks to Tilly, I was born, to everyone's joy. -Leone, smile! Smile! -Smile! Smile. [roaring] [Leone] My childhood was like that of many other children, and I didn't pay too much attention to the peculiarities of my family. However, as I grew up, society was divided, and people took to the streets. Some to defend traditional family and others to defend the rights of diverse families, like ours. I was 11 when they were finally allowed to enter into a civil partnership. So even in the eyes of the law, they were now officially a couple. With this ring, I take you as my husband. I now pronounce you husband and husband. [crowd cheering] [man] To the newly-weds! [Leone] Of course, civil partnerships were a great achievement, but two people of the same sex still couldn't be on the same birth certificate. Either you have a proxy or one of the parents has to come collect the medical report for him. -But I am one of his two actual parents… -No, no, no, no. [Leone] On my Italian birth certificate, I could only have one parent. I told you to bring the proxy, Dad. And Paolo was the only one on my certificate. However, a few months ago, we got some great news. Here they are! Tell us why today is such an important day for us. Come on, Leo. Let us get dressed at least. [Leone] Come on, Dad. Say something! As absurd as it is, since I've been your father for 15 years already, uh, from now on, my name will finally be on your birth certificate too. [Leone] After a bit of a battle, today, the mayor of Fiumicino has agreed to duplicate the American certificate that shows both Paolo and Simone as my parents. [gentle music playing] Everything's perfect, right? [music stops] Not yet. Because my parents warned me that this certificate could very well be… revoked. What do you think? It's good, isn't it? Yeah, it's good, but I think it's still a bit on the short side. -What do you think, mate? -Yeah. I mean, Mirante and Fabbri's is an hour long. Yeah, but it's boring, all about the social structure of ants. Ours has it all, the family, social struggles, real life. Yeah, I know. It's just… -I don't know. Something's missing for me. -We need a good twist in the tale. -Like what? -Like revealing who your real father is. You're still going on about that. I told you. They're both real. How can you not know who your biological father is? Haven't you asked a million times? [indistinct chattering] Who's that girl? Who, the French one? Join the queue. She's just started here. She's trying to get in with the right people. She'd never even look at us. [giggles] -Told you so. -What are you laughing at? [teacher] Okay, listen, please. Remember, the screening of your videos will be at the end of the school year. It's open to the whole school and your families too. Leone, how is your video on LGBT rights in Europe going? -[Leone] It's good, yeah. -[giggling] We're, uh, telling it using the story of my own family. Mm-hmm. -[giggling] -[Leone] Um… I'm just worried it's a bit too personal. -[student] Shh. -[giggling stops] This generation of yours shares every second of their lives on social media. I think you're all perfectly aware of how the private's become public. Starting with personal experience, it's the best way to talk about pretty much anything. Hmm? Immigration, the environment, social crisis, solidarity… They're all very interesting topics. It's a good way of showing your awareness. -[bell rings] -Work hard now, all of you. And make sure you put your heart and soul into it. Okay? [coach] Good job, Elena. Keep going. Stay low. I know you've just discovered what masturbation's about, but don't go overboard… -[whispering] I've got the weed for you. -Good job, Leone! Keep going. Michela, go. -Hold on. -[grunts] -Oh my God. -[laughing] Don't bloody laugh. The girls are our only hope, I'm telling you. Go. You can tell you don't wank enough. [laughs] Wanking's not the problem. At least I didn't get stoned before coming here. -Just testing the quality of my product. -Yeah, sure. -[coach] Come on, guys! Come on! -[Leone groans] -Look. -[coach] Hurry up! Come on. Now! [friend] Have you seen the new kid? He's a good climber. [coach] Good. Good. [friend] And it looks like he's hit it off with the French girl. [coach] Come on, put some energy into it, boys. He's hot, tall, ripped, dating the most beautiful girl in school, and I bet he does fuck all work and still gets good grades. [coach] Come on. There's a party at my place tonight. Okay. -And? -I'm inviting you, loser. Starts at ten. Everyone's coming. We'll need some weed. Sure, all the weed you need. Hmm, okay. Jacopo, there's no way I'm going to that party. -Leone, no! -I'm not going, Jacopo… I haven't been to a party since year nine. Do it for me, please. Come on. What have you got to lose? Why don't you want to go? We'll smoke a couple of joints, have a few drinks. -[coach] Well done! -Okay, but only 'cause you're begging me. -You're a great mate. -Get off! -Thank you. -Jacopo! I haven't forgotten about you. I'm sorry, Coach. I've got a stomach ache. I need to go to the toilet!

Do you really need to put so much of our private life in it? Aren't you proud? We've raised an activist. Or an opportunist who exploits his, uh, parents' struggles to get good marks at school. That still sounds like a good enough reason to me, no? Yeah, whatever. Just so you know, I will never let you use any of my images where I don't look at my most handsome and youthful, clear? Well, then there won't be any images of you in this video. That settles it. Maybe with a bit of help using photo editing, we can save two or three of them. [laughing] [all laugh] -Oh! -Such an idiot! -Oh! -[Simone] Oi, oi, oi. -[video call rings] -[Paolo] Guys, it's Tilly! -Hi, Aunt Tilly! -Hey! -[Leone] Hi. -[Paolo] How are you? How is my lovely Italian family doing? [both laugh] -Did you get my package? - [Paolo] Yes! -Yes. Yeah. - It's wonderful, your present. -Wow! -[Tilly laughs] -Very, very beautiful. -[mimicking Indian call] -[Tilly] Where's the little one, huh? -I'm not little anymore. Hi, Dede! Oh, hi, Leone! -How are you? -Fine. You? -[Tilly] Did you like my present? -Of course! Ah. I'll catch beautiful dreams with this. -[Tilly laughs] -Thank you. We miss you, Tilly. Miss you! It's our fault. It was our turn to visit this time. [Paolo] Hi, Leroy. -How are you? -[Leroy] Hey, guys. -Happy anniversary! - [Tilly laughs] -How is your King Road Classic doing? -Oh man, I love my King. Almost as much as I love my queen. Oh, uh, we should go. We're in the shop, and it's starting to get busy. But keep an eye out. That is not the last of your anniversary presents. -Twenty years together. -Exactly. -Twenty years. -[Tilly] Bye! ["Notti In Bianco" by Blanco playing] -Wow! This is so cool! -[song continues] [singing along] [Jacopo] Thank you. Leo, we've only just arrived at her house. Let's enjoy the party. [song continues] -What the fuck is going on? -[boy] Fight! Fight! Fight! Ah! Ooh! -[girl] Stop! -[crowd clamouring] -[boy] Go on! -[girl] Stop it! Dario! -[boy] He-hey! -[clamouring] [boy] Fight! Fight! Fight… [in French] Dario? Can you stop being a moron or what? -Hmm? -[clamouring stops] ["Beautiful Life (Love Is Around)" by SSD Project feat. Timpy Dee playing] [in English] Are they crazy? I'm off for a smoke. See you later. [in French] Is this just for you? -Hmm? Huh? -[cap clatters] [music continues] [sniffs, exhales] [sniffs] [in French] You're such an idiot. [in English] Leave me. Just leave. He likes to get physical with people. It's his hobby. [in French] Shut up! Anna. [in English] Dario. Look at this. Go on, look. Want a drink? Come and sit with me? Me? Yes. I hate parties. They're always full of idiots. And Dario likes them for that reason, because there's always someone to fight with. Yeah, your boyfriend really is quite viol… direct. [chuckles] My boyfriend? You mean Dario? -Yeah. -He's not my boyfriend. He's not? Because you two seem so… -So he's-- -He's my twin brother. Your twin brother. Well, I have to say your brother seems to be settling in pretty well. With those idiots? No. He tries to act like an alpha male, but he's not like them. We're nothing alike. I love being here in Italy, while he misses that shithole Lille. -Oh, you lived in Lille? -Yes. -Well, Lille is a beautiful city. -No, it sucks in Lille. -Of course. -It's always cold, always raining. -Yeah, Rome is warmer. -Mmm. I mean, it's warmer, but in winter, uh, it's… It's definitely warmer. -Right. -And Rome is huge. In Lille, after a while, you know everybody. And… I mean, it's not like this is New York, you know. [chuckles] No, but there's a lot of different people, and… I've never met anyone with two fathers before, for example. I saw you're making a video about it for the school project. [house song builds] -I like this song. Let's go. -Really? -Come on. -No. I'll just watch. DADDY SIMONE, COME AND GET US AS LATE AS POSSIBLE [woman speaking Italian on TV] [Paolo yawning] [groans] [message chimes] [woman continues speaking Italian on TV] AT LEAST TWO HOURS. GOT IT? [sighs] [Simone] Did you like the wine? I recommended it because I personally love the combination of the flavours between the two, the robust Cabernet Sauvignon and the splendid Mediterranean setting of the Bolgheri which makes it full-- Can we please have a dessert menu? -Sure. -Thanks. Michela, uh, take the dessert menu to the couple at that table. And I need to find the cordless phone. Don't know where the hell my phone is, and I need to call my son. [Michela] Sure, I'll get it for you. [phone keys beep] -[Michela] You're getting old, aren't you? -Don't… [house music playing] -I can't dance. -Come on, relax. [message chimes] [sighs] Riccardo. RECENT CALLS Riccardo. Riccardo. Riccardo. Hmm. I've been trying to call you for the past hour. Where are you? Can't you come by after closing up? Never mind. You're still not answering. Will you tell me what's going on? Are you still at the restaurant, or are you with the ball and chain? Oh my God. Oh my God. Listen, darling. I'm starting to get worried. If you're trying to get back at me for the other night, I'll make you pay. Oh my God. [Riccardo] No, I didn't mean that. Please call me back, then, okay? "Darling"? [phone ringing] INCOMING CALL [ringing continues] No, no, no, no. Don't screw up. Don't screw up. -[ringing continues] -No, no, no, no. No. SIMONE, ANSWER! [scoffs] SORRY, CAN'T TALK NOW. I'M AT HOME! "I can't talk right now." [sniffs] AT HOME? SO WE AREN'T MEETING? No! "I really can't tonight." [breath trembling] ACTUALLY, GIVE ME SOME SPACE. I NEED SOME TIME! WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? "Maybe it was all just a big mistake." ARE YOU MAD? YOU REALIZE THIS AFTER TWO YEARS? -[tense music plays] -[mumbling] PLEASE, DARLING. TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON! Two years? [sniffles] [sighs] Two years! [house music playing] What the fuck! You know, Lavinia's friends aren't that bad after all. I'm surprised. I mean, they think they're all big shots. I get why… Jonathan. Jonathan says he's a rapper, but I listened to one of his songs. ♪ I'm from the ghetto I'm gonna bury you ♪ ♪ I am a sniper I'm gonna shoot you ♪ ♪ Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta ♪ I mean, it's completely shit. But they all think it's cool, so it's all good for me too. What do you want? Leo, you're my best friend. I'll always share everything with you. We'll be best friends forever. Yes, you too. You too. Stop it now. Hey, stop it! My dad's gonna be here in half an hour. You're all sweaty, and your eyes are red. I swapped some gear with the guys. -Look. -What the actual fuck? In my scientific opinion, it's a balanced combination of ecstasy and amphetamine, yeah. -Come on, take it back. -No! You have to try it. -No, no, no. -It's a bomb. I'm flying! I'm flying! [vocalizing] -Try it. -No, I don't want to. -Put it in your pocket. -My dad will be here in half an hour. -We haven't got time! -For what? We have to do it now, Leo! Do what? Go swimming, Leo! No! [girl screams] Get out, now! Stu… no. [crowd clamouring] -[screams] -Let's go! No. No, no, no, no. Stupid idiot. What's the matter with you? -[girl screams] -[crowd cheering] -[music stops] -[doorbell buzzes] [woman] Paolo. Are you okay? Simone is cheating on me. What am I supposed to do now? [sobbing] I'm sorry. He's going to leave me. I know he's going to leave me. Listen to me. You know how much I love you. And you know I'd do anything for you, but… But, Paolo, if I were Simone, I would have left you so many years ago! -What the fuck, Monica? -Yes! Because since Leone was born, all you've done is deal with baby food, nappies, doctors, vaccinations. And then there's homework, sports practice, teachers… -Yes-- -…English lessons, lessons in Chinese. What's happened to your relationship? Where's the passion? Passion after 20 years of marriage? Where's the passion? I don't know. It's gone. It's on holiday. I thought our relationship was built on other things. -On love, I thought. -Let's talk about love, then. When was the last time you looked Simone in the eyes? When was the last time you asked him about his thoughts, about his fears? Ugh, we don't have time for that. You know? You've got to find the time, Paolo! Look, I'm telling you from experience. Carlo? Carlo. -You mean Carlo, Carlo? Our Carlo? -Our Carlo, Carlo, yes. Twenty-six years. A teacher of yoga. Tits as firm as two green apples hanging on a tree. As bendy as a pipe cleaner, an ass toned like marble. -Our Carlo, Carlo? -Yes, Carlo, Carlo. I wanted to surprise him, so I went to pick him up from yoga, and I found them in the car. She was in a position called "fondling the gear stick." That slapper! What exactly was I supposed to do, do you think? Kick him in the bollocks. Clean him out. But I didn't. I didn't. I forgave him. I realized it was partly my fault as well. -And you know what I did? -What? I suggested a threesome. -You did what? -It's when three people-- Yes, I know what a threesome is. But you really… No, don't worry. The slapper turned it down. Anyway, you get my point? I didn't give up on him. I fought hard to win him back. And I did it. Mummy, what's a slapper? -[laughs] -Darling, wha-- -Where did you hear that word? -[girl] You just said it. [Monica] Come on, off to bed. You've got school tomorrow. -[kisses] Bye. -[girl] Good night, Uncle Paolo. Good night, sweetheart. How did she hear that? [gentle music playing] [whispering] Psst. Paolo. Have you seen my phone anywhere? [sniffs] No. [sniffs] -Guess what this is. What is it? Have a guess. -[sniffs] -[both laugh] [sniffs] No. They said to measure the density of a liquid. They didn't say which liquid. And this one has a high content of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Hey, guys. What are you up to? -Um… -[Jacopo] Nothing. It's a herbal infusion. -Those herbs? -Yeah, those herbs. [chuckles] -Have you tried it yet? -No, not yet. How about trying it tonight? No, I can't tonight. It's my parents' 20th wedding anniversary. Oh, so cute. What are you doing for it? Nothing, just a quiet meal at home, a cake, and a little bit of fizz. -[message chimes] -[chuckles] Never mind. You can come around if you like, though. I mean, won't be like yesterday's party, but if you bring your-- You know how much I love your family, but please spare me a dinner with them. -Now, if you'll excuse me… -He's right. It'll be so boring. -They're all old. [chuckles] -It sounds like a great idea. Really? After last night's party, I could do with a quiet one. At least my mum won't make too much of a fuss since we'll be with your parents. -Am I invited even without Jacopo? -Yes. Yeah, of course. -Okay. Send me your address. [chuckles] -Sure. -[Jacopo] Leone. -[chuckles] I just sold this chemistry experiment for 60 euros. -[laughing] -I sold it to the dude with the mop. Why are you laughing? Did you try it? No. She… -Did she try it? -No, she didn't try it either. [scoffs] I'll tell you later. -But we'll try it later, right? -Yes. It's gonna be embarrassing. My family's gonna be there. They'll treat me like a right child, no doubt. What's the problem? Talking to her was like mission impossible, and now she's coming to yours, and you're complaining? [both laugh] [boys teasing, whistling] Paolo told me to set the table for six people. Yes. Yes, perfect, Mariela. Paolo's parents won't be here, Monica and Carlo aren't bringing the children, and Leone's bringing a friend. -Thank you, Mariela. -You're welcome. Be strong, Paolo. You'll get through this. You are a 52-year-old homosexual man. You've seen a lot in your life. You will definitely survive this horrible betrayal. And this sham of an evening. Talking to yourself in the mirror, sir? -Uh, sorry, what? -Everything is ready for you. Simone and Leone are finishing off the cooking. I'll be off now. Happy anniversary, sir. Yes, thank you. Bye. Come on. [clears throat] [doorbell rings] [woman chuckles] -Well, good evening. -Good evening. I'm Elisa Del Monte. And you must be Leone. Yes, Ferrari. -Hi, Anna. Dario. -[Dario] Hey. -It was very kind of you to invite Anna. -[chuckles] I have to go, but if your parents are here, I'd like to wish them a happy anniversary. -Ah! -Dad, uh… -Good evening. -Good evening. -Good evening. -Paolo. Elisa. Nice to meet you. -Hi. You must be Anna. -[Anna] Yes, Anna. -My pleasure. -And this is Dario. -Hi, Dario. -Nice to meet you. -Well, what a lovely house. -Thank you. [chuckles] I wanted to thank you for inviting her and also congratulate you on your anniversary. -Anna tells me it's been 15 years. -It's actually 20. Well, in that case, very well done indeed. If your wife is here, I'd love to congratulate her . [Leone clears throat] -[chuckles] -I imagine she's busy at the moment. Yes, well, another time maybe. -Hello. You must be Anna's mum, yes? -Oh, yes, yes. -Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Simone. -Hi. Are you the chef? [chuckles] -[clears throat] -No, I'm a good cook, but I'm Leone's other male father. [silence] [Paolo] That's right, yes. Oh! [chuckles] I bet someone forgot to mention that today is the anniversary of a couple of blokes. Looks like it. [laughs nervously] Yes, actually. No… Yeah… Um, Anna, you should've told me. You made me look ridiculous. [laughs] No, it's not a problem. Of course not! It's absolutely no problem. It's just that I didn't know, so… Congratulations, though. Thank you. Thank you. I was just telling, um… -Paolo. -Yes, my husband. -[Elisa] Exactly. -His husband. Exactly. Exactly. Yes. I really have to go now. Thank you. Goodbye. -[Paolo] Bye! -Bye. [Paolo] Goodbye. -Leo. -Guys, I already told her, you know. -Plus, everyone at school knows. -Of course. It's not a problem. Come on. What? -Hiya. -Hello. -Simone. Nice to meet you. -My pleasure. Anna. -Let's go through. -[Anna] Thank you. -[Paolo] So, Anna, you're not from Rome? -[Anna] No, I've… I've just moved here. She's new. She just moved to my school this year. Anna, forgive me for saying this, but you should've warned your mother that this is a family with two dads. Mmm. Why? Is it something that needs saying? I wanted to see the look on her face. My mother claims to be a modern, open, and progressive woman, but the only family she understands is the traditional one. [Monica] Of course. [Anna] If you tell her she's homophobic, she'll say she's not because she has… [all] Lots of friends who are gay! [laugh] [Anna] Exactly. Shame I've never met any of them. [silence] The truth is, she can't stand the idea that a family like yours can possibly be happier than hers. -Hmm. -[quirky music playing] [Simone clears throat] -[doorbell rings] -[clears throat] -[Monica] Who's that? -I don't know. It could be Mariela. -Oh. -She's probably forgotten her purse again. [Simone] No, wait. I'll go. Can you take the cake out of the fridge? Sure. Sure. [footsteps receding] [doorbell rings] [Simone] I'm coming. -What are you doing here? Are you crazy? -I've been calling you since yesterday. -Why the fuck won't you answer? -Because I lost my phone, that's why. You lost it? Really? If you have something to say, I'd appreciate if you said it to my face. Or am I asking too much? I don't know what the fuck is up with you, but you can't be here! We'll talk later. I have to go back inside now. What, to celebrate your anniversary? -Yeah, so what? -Congratulations! Does he know you've been fucking someone else for two years? Will you just stop it? -My son's inside, and all my friends. -Who cares? Keep your damn voice down. [Paolo] Simone! Who is it? It's just a work thing. Uh, coming. Hey, will you calm it down or not? Why the hell did you come here, eh? Get out now! Wait, listen. At least have the courage to look me in the eyes and tell me, eh? Well, tell you what? If I think of all your bullshit I swallowed… That you'd leave him, that you'd come and stay with me. I believed you like an idiot. I can't believe you're making a scene here in front of my house! Anyway, I don't want to be with someone who reacts like this just because I didn't answer the telephone. -[inaudible] -[footsteps approaching] Do you need help with the cake? [inaudible] Who's that? How could he have invited him here on the eve of our anniversary? What are you doing? Want to make a scene in front of everyone? -Really? -Let me go. -I've already been patient enough. -Paolo, wait! -Please, let me go. -Paolo, calm down! Listen to me! Listen to me! -[breathing heavily] -I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to go back in there, sit down and eat, okay? Somehow, we'll get to the end of the evening, okay? Afterwards, very calmly and with a cool head, you can confront Simone. Okay? Reasonably, as only you can be. -Okay? -Okay. And possibly things aren't how you think they are. -You're right. Why should they be? -Huh? Why? -I tend to overreact. -Of course. You're right. Maybe. No, no, no. I'm gonna kill him, Monica! [Monica] Do you want Leone to find out in front of his friend? Not to mention Carlo already thinks your marriage is a farce! It is. A farce. That's what it's become. [Carlo] I mean, there are so many things to see in Rome. Actually, Dad, Anna wanted to see some nice places around Rome. I was thinking of taking her to Guadagnolo. Do you think, Dad? Guadagnolo? -Yes. -It's beautiful. It's an amazing place. -Do you remember, Carlo? -[Carlo] Yes, it's really amazing. -You gonna wait for me to cut the cake? -No. -So, do you think we can go? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, then, who was at the door? A supplier from the restaurant. Hmm. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I know it wasn't an ideal time, but I can't find my phone. -He couldn't get hold-- -A supplier? -[Simone] Yeah. -Is the cream on the cake vegan? So now the restaurant suppliers come directly to a house at night. -I told you. He couldn't get hold of me. -[Paolo] Of course! -Suppliers come here to interrupt us… -[Monica] Calm down. …on the evening of our wedding anniversary! Hmm? [softly] Stop that. Stop that. And as if that's not bad enough, the suppliers kiss the owner of the house in the fucking garden, right? -Have you gone crazy? -Tell us the truth! What exactly is going on here? Ask your father. But did you really kiss the supplier? -Dad, what does this mean? -It doesn't mean anything. I'm just sorry for Anna who has to see your father throwing a hissy fit just like that. -I mean-- -I've seen a lot worse. -Sorry, why on earth do you have my phone? -Because you left it at home. That's why. -You told me you hadn't seen it. -But I did see it. And I also saw all the messages from Riccardo. -Who's Ric-- Ow! -[Paolo] The fucking supplier! He's been Simone's supplier for two years if I'm not mistaken. Yes, it's been two years. [chuckles] Dad. Leone, I'll explain everything calmly. [Paolo] How could you? Tell me how the fuck you could do this to me? I trusted you. Not much, obviously, no. Since you went rummaging through the text messages on my phone. Of course! So now it's my fault for catching you out, eh? What the fuck were you doing reading all of my text messages? Don't change the subject. Simone, Paolo, not in front of the children! [Simone] No! We'll talk about it later. And we'll also talk about our… about our separation arrangements. You shit. You're just fucking off? I've destroyed our marriage. Since it's all my fault, I'm the one leaving. Are you happy? [shouting] Happy, huh?! Who's throwing a hissy fit now? -Who's the drama queen now?! -[Leone] Dad! -I'm leaving! Don't worry-- -Where are you going? -Of course! Now you're leaving! -You've ruined everything-- -[doorbell rings] -Who's that? -Not the supplier again? -Carlo. -[Leone] I'll go. -No! -No, no, please! -Dad, let me go now! Please stay out of this. I'll go! I'll go! And I will listen to it all with pleasure. You're not listening! [all shouting together] -Ta-da! -Ta-da! -Happy anniversary! -Happy anniversary, guys! Hi. -Tilly. -Hello. Leone? -[sad music playing] -[both arguing indistinctly] Turned out to be quite the shitty night, huh? All my folks did was yell all sorts at each other. And then they eventually split up, and things got a lot better. Are we still going to go tomorrow to Gua… -Guadagnolo. -Guadagnolo. Right? -Yeah. -Okay. Anna? [both continue arguing indistinctly] [chuckles] You look good in that suit. [chuckles] Oh, not really. This old thing. -It's Prada. -[scoffs] I always envied your style. Refined but never pretentious. I'm sorry, Tilly. I'm sorry, Leroy. -It was a beautiful surprise, but-- -Nah. We just came to say hello. We'll be off now. Where are you going? We're going to Sicily to visit the village Leroy's grandparents are from. Six hundred kilometres by bike, it's a long trip. [chuckles] [Leroy] It's not a bike, babe. It's a Harley. Not a Road King, sure, but, uh, it's gonna be fine. [footsteps approaching] Simone, are you leaving? Yes. [Tilly] Oh, guys… I don't know what happened, but… I just want you to know how much I love you, huh. I love you, guys. We love you too, Tilly. You're like a sister. At any other time, it would've been great to spend some time together, but… [Tilly sighs] [sad music playing] Tilly, I… I've got to go. I'm leaving. Well done! Go. Go! Go fuck yourself! And don't ever come back! -[door slams shut] -[footsteps running] -[knocking on door] -Who is it? [Tilly] Can I come in? Hi, Dede. "Dede"? You still like to call me that? -Do you prefer "Mummy"? -Oh no, no, no. "Dede" is great. You're very creative. I always tell my children that whenever I talk about my family from Italy. Did you see that? And they've never done that before? Sure. But only for normal things. Never got this far. -[sighs] -Don't judge them too quickly, Leone. No, I… I just didn't think it could happen to them. Neither did I. [clicks tongue] What a nice twist for my video about our beautiful family. No? There's an ancient Japanese art called "kintsugi." When you break a precious object, instead of throwing it away, with a little liquid gold, you put the broken pieces back together. The scars are still there, but the object becomes more precious. The scars are kind of good. They're what makes a person unique. You know? I think so. [gentle music playing] [sighs] [message chimes] FORGIVE ME IF YOU CAN… I LOVE YOU! Why don't you fuck off and die. [upbeat music playing] -Hiya. -[Dario] It's her fault. I was ready half an hour ago. I hear there's a great wall for climbing in Guadagnolo. My mother would only let me come today if he was allowed to play chaperone and come too. Of course. [sighs] The dangers of going out with the son of two hysterical queers. -Did you tell her about last night, huh? -No. My mother needs to focus on her own problems. What about the lady? Tilly? Isn't she your mother too? What did she say? No, she's not my mother. She's my surrogate, my Dede. That's what I call her. It's a long story. Yesterday, I was looking at you, and you looked like such a nice family. I'm sorry. Well, I was trying to guess who your biological father was. But I couldn't. You sort of look like the both of them. -Is it Simone or Paolo? -I don't know. -[Anna] What do you mean? -Nobody knows. Do we really have to talk about it now? Of course. -You know what a cocktail is, right? -Mm-hmm. I'm the son of some sort of cocktail. Basically, my parents took a test tube and mixed in their… Sperm. -Yes. -Mm-hmm. Exactly. Uh, then, that mixture along with the donor eggs made the embryos that ended up in Tilly, and after nine months, I was born. Just like that. Does any of that make any sense to you? [chuckles] I think so. [energetic classical music playing] [strains, sighs] [sighs] [message chimes] WILL YOU GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE? [music fades] [Leone] Beautiful, isn't it? It was worth the trip. [Dario] It's perfect. And the wall is amazing. Are you guys climbing too? -There? -Yeah. [Anna] I'll pass. -[Dario] You, Leone? -It's high, isn't it? [Dario] I brought along some kit for you too, and I'm here if needs be. -I'll go up and prepare the route. -Okay. I'll film your efforts, then. You don't have to climb if you don't want to. No. [grunts] I can do it. Are you sure? -He's pretty good. -Ah, yes, he's good. -He's very good? -Yes, very good. [groans] It's easy. You can do it. Heads up! [thuds] Okay. Here I go. [Dario] Leone, take it slowly. Look for the right foot and hand holds and climb up slowly. Good. Other way now. Come on. [Leone] There it is. -Oh. -[Dario] You okay? [softly] Okay. -[Dario] Put your hand over there. -Yeah. [Dario] In front of your knee. -Look for some holds on the other side. -[strains] [Dario] Okay. Well done. [strains] [Dario] Good. -[screams] -[grunts] [Dario] Easy, easy, easy, easy. -[Anna] Hey, Leo, are you all right? -Yes. Yes. Get back on the wall. Get back on the wall. [breathing heavily] [Anna] Please, be careful! [Dario] Come on. Come on. [straining] -Whoa! -[Dario] Watch it! You okay? -Okay? -[Leone] Yeah. [Dario] You can do it. Almost there. Hand. -[Leone grunts] -Oh! [chuckles] [chuckles] Good job. See? I told you you could do it. You were amazing. If it wasn't for you, I'd still be hanging on that rock. [sighs] [Leone] Hey, she's not gonna post the video, is she? [laughs] Why not, though? It'd make you look good. You've shown a lot of courage. Why not? I'd like to show the same courage in other things. I like hanging out with you. Seriously. I've never met a guy like you before. And that makes me think, because I… I'm finally… [tense music playing] You're the first gay guy that I've liked, and I'm not sure what I should do for once. Dario, I'm not gay. -What do you mean, "not gay"? -I'm not gay. -But your folks are queer. I mean… -My folks… [laughs] -No. No, no, no. -[scoffs] I don't believe this. I didn't mean like that… Leone… Even Anna said you were. -How can you not be gay? -It's my parents who are gay! It's my parents who are gay. But I'm not. Your parents are straight, and you're clearly not. It's not some kind of contagious disease that you can catch-- -Are you going to tell anyone? -No. -Are you, huh? -No. -Gonna keep your mouth shut. -Yes. Good boy. [Leone exhales] -Leone, are you okay? -Your brother's a prick. I'm sorry. He still hasn't got his head around this thing. Did you know about this? Huh? Did you arrange this whole thing to match me up with your brother? Of course not! I knew he liked you, but I thought you liked him as well. That's why you were so curious about my folks. So nice and kind always. -You even wanted to come over to mine. -I just wanted to help him too. Listen, I've been called a poof my entire life because of my parents. And I'm sorry to let you both down. It would be great if I was actually gay, but unfortunately, I'm just not, just not. You don't really know why I came here today? Because I like you, Anna. You. -And I thought you came because of me. -[gentle music playing] But I was wrong. I'm sorry. [music continues] [sighs] [keys clatter] -Hey, Pa. -Hey, buddy. How was the trip? It was all right. How are you? Me? I'm fine. I'm fine. -[sniffs] -I see that you've changed everything. Yes, I did some cleaning around the house. -Hungry? Would you like something to eat? -No. -Sorry, what are you doing? -Some cleaning. And you're throwing Dad's wine away? Oh, do you mean your father's pretentious little wine collection? Yep. But they mean a lot to him. What, because of that course he went to to be a sommelier? [scoffs] [sniffs] What's this? Oops. [sniffs] [crying softly] I'm sorry, Dad. Listen, I'm going to bed. I'm a bit tired. [bluesy music playing] ♪ I don't wanna live The rest of my life with you… ♪ [Riccardo] I'm sorry. This isn't how it was supposed to go. I was an asshole. I admit it.

I will if you want me to. -You think it's all a joke, don't you? -You're overreacting. -How could I know that? -What, huh? That I'm not gay? -Sorry, my fault. Should've told you. -No, Leo. Don't go! You were right, you know. Right about what? I think I have feelings for you. Oh. Your dad's here. The hot one. We'll talk later, okay? See you. Hey. [sighs] What are you doing here? I wanted to spend some time with my son. Shall we grab a bite together? Hmm? How about pizza? Dad's hurting, and you couldn't care less, could you? It's not easy for me either. But this mess is all because of you, is it not? I've been having an affair for months. I'm disgusting. I'm a liar. I know. But it wasn't all my fault, believe me. Things in life are never black or white. We both got to this point together. It's just that sometimes things go a certain way. -And you have no idea how you got there. -You don't know. You don't know. I tried, Leo. We tried, but it didn't work out. What I did was wrong. I know that. But it's just a consequence, not the cause. Do you understand me? [sighs] I don't know. I don't know. Listen, you tell me a little bit about Anna. -She looks like-- -Dad, are you coming home? -Did you go hiking-- -Hey, Dad. You coming home at all? I don't know. Not right now. [chuckles softly] I'm always going to be here for you. Always. -You're not getting rid of me that easily. -[chuckles] So, what about that pizza? Where can we get one? -Huh? -Maybe another time, Dad. [sighs] [sighs] All right. [grunts] [sad music playing] [message chimes] GUYS, I HAVE IMPORTANT NEWS. LET'S MEET TOMORROW MORNING IN MY STUDIO Here we go. That's all I need now. Guys, I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but the Supreme Court has ruled against double paternity. What? So, basically, in the eyes of the law, we're no longer both his parents? So what now? Well, you know, they might ask you to go back to the previous situation. Wait, you mean the situation where, legally, I am Leone's only parent mentioned on the birth certificate by law? Is that correct? -Or what? -[Domenico] Not exactly. Since you've never actually wanted to know who Leone's biological father was, they might require you to have further testing. Unfortunately, they might also ask for a DNA test. So we might all be forced to take the test to find out who the biological father is? It's a possibility. Well, to be honest, it's very likely. No, no, no. This sounds like some sort of Nazi solution. Come on! I think we should just go back to the previous situation. -Why? That's not for you to decide. -The law says so. -It's the law! -The law says something different. "Previous situation." According to Italian law, favor veritatis prevails over favor minoris . -What the fuck is this favor thing? -Let me explain. Let me explain. The determination of who is allowed to become the parent passes exclusively through the genetic link with the child. -Solely? -Only through that. -Only that. Of course. -I don't know, Domenico. I mean, under these circumstances, to take a DNA test in this way, it… it could be traumatic for all of us. -And especially for Leone, I fear. -[gentle music playing] I'M HERE… BUT WHERE ARE YOU? Guess who? -[chuckles] -Keep your eyes shut. Why? Did you get me a gift? Yes. This one. Do you like it? Why me, though? Because you've been nice. -Really? -Mm-hmm. -When? -Always. Even when you were hanging off that rock face. -Oh God, no. Please delete that video. -I can't do that. It's in here, and it'll stay there forever. -Are you sure? -Yes. So you won't post it? [romantic music soars] Oh God, are you sure? I'm not prepared for a scene. Don't worry. Paolo's at the fair. Leone's at the park. We won't be long. What has he done? He's moved everything. -There's not a lot. It won't take long. -Are you really just taking your books? Yes, everything else is his. The shop, the house, the restaurant, they're all Paolo's. [sighs] From all our years together, I have nothing left. The only valuable things are my bottles of wine. They're in the kitchen. Actually, look, there's the wine cabinet. Can you get them for me to take to the restaurant? Sure. I'll go. [Simone] This is mine! I got him this as a present ten years ago. -He didn't even open it. -[Riccardo] I can't find them. Wait. I'm coming. I told you. They're in here, in the wine cabinet, on the right. No. No! -What? -No! -Did he chuck out all your wine? -I don't believe it! No! No, no, no! Not the Sassicaia! No! No! Piece of shit! Piece of shit! Piece of shit! [huffing] You're gonna pay for this. You're gonna pay. [percussion music playing] -Calm-- -Don't you dare touch me! Where is it? Where is it? Here it is! You like Prada… [grunting] You shit! [panting, grunting] -Simone, wait! -Get off! Get off! Off! [panting] [straining] -What the fuck are you doing? -Don't touch me. Don't touch me. [grunts] I'm not done. I'm not done. Let it go. What the fuck are you doing? -Let it go! Let it go! -[grunting] -It's not worth it, Simone. -[panting] It's not worth it. Let it go, okay? -There's a little pouch over there. -Okay. This one. You have a psychiatric ward supply of tranquillizers. [chuckles] You don't wanna know. No, that's Leone's. -You mean your son uses it? -Mmm. -So this is Leone's hair. -Yeah. [Riccardo] Say they force you to take the test, it would be good to know the answer beforehand, right? Leone would never take the test. Forget it. Yes, but there are hair bulbs here, and in each bulb, there's DNA. Do you want to be caught unprepared? I'll take care of it. [Paolo shouting] No! No, no, no, no! No! [Paolo sobbing] No! [Leone] What happened here? Look. Look at what he's capable of! -[grunts] -Did Dad do that? He came here. And he tore it to pieces, my Prada! What the hell? He's gone crazy. He's gone crazy. But could it be because you threw his bottles of wine away, Dad? [laughs] And what did he throw away? He flushed our whole family down the toilet! It's never just one person's fault, you know that, Dad? It's him. So he's started feeding you all this rubbish, has he? Of course he has. He came to your school. You saw him. Listen! You're not allowed to speak to him ever again, is that clear? You're not allowed to see him again. Ever! Don't you think that's taking it a bit far, Dad? Huh? -Too much? -Mm-hmm. -Whose side are you on, my boy? -I'm not taking anyone's side, Dad. Okay. You want to go and live with him? Go ahead! Go live with him! Fine! Feel free to abandon me just like he did. It's impossible talking to you. You've always been like that. You never fucking listen to anybody! Look, you two do whatever you want. Just leave me out of it, okay? [dramatic music playing] [grunts] [huffing] [music intensifying] [screams] [crying] [muffled screaming] -[music fades] -[exhales] [inhales] -[Domenico] Hello? -Listen, Domenico. We have to kick his ass. -Leave him with nothing. -[Domenico] That doesn't feel right. No, no, no, no, no. You don't understand. It's war. I want to annihilate him. [Jacopo] Did she do that? Get off. That'll never happen to me. -[lighter flicking] -Yeah. I'm jealous. No, thanks. Hey, why the long face? It's my parents, Jaco. I've never seen them like this, winding each other up like little boys. Why don't you film them? It's the twist we were looking for. It's perfect! -What the fuck, man. -It'll make the project brilliant. Listen, Jacopo, we're not doing the documentary anymore. -And who decided that? -I did. My family, my decision. But it's my end-of-year project too. We've worked on it together since the start. You know how much I bust the gut. You can't do this to me, Leone. -Leone? -They're two shitty people, Jaco. And I don't want anything to do with them. Okay? Why not put that in the documentary too. If you wanna say it, say it. "They're two shitty people." Come on. We'll start with a happy scene and then-- -Just fuck off, will ya? -[phone clatters] It happens to everyone, Leone. Welcome to the real world. Besides, wasn't that the whole point? Showing how your family can be shit too, just like mine. Like everyone else's. [sad music playing] And you can fuck off too. [sad music intensifies] [man speaking in muffled voice] [normal voice] …the wine in the cellar, how much would we save? No, come on, please. We need the microwave. I'd rather give up the work surface in Carrara marble. -Um… -[man] How much is the mosaic? -What do you think? No? -[motorbike approaching] The mosaic is too much. [Simone] I'll smack your face, you bloody queen! Now you're gonna hear me! -Get down here, asshole! -Actually, the mosaic isn't a bad idea. Where the fuck is he? Huh? Get down here! Get down! I'll go and check if we have a mosaic in the sale. -[man] Yes, in the sale. -Be right back, okay? -What are you doing here? -Where the fuck are you going, eh? What the fuck are you doing, Paolo? What the fuck is this? You are not selling the restaurant. If I'm not mistaken, the last time I checked, the building is mine. Hey, we had an agreement, yeah? I ran your place and contributed to the family expenses. Sure, but you also had another agreement that was called marriage. But unfortunately, that agreement no longer exists, right? Hmm? What the hell are you doing? Get your filthy, bloody hands off me! You're gonna call off the agreement of sale right now. -Oh really? -Yeah. Ah. So you're threatening me now. Wait a second. Hold on. Here we go. -Oh God, you're such a prick. -You can talk now. Come on, talk! I… I gave up my doctorate because I had to have a job to contribute to the well-being of the family. -[laughs] -You asked me to! What about me, then? I… I could've been a great architect, but no, I'm here selling shitty, insignificant little kitchens. You're free now. Go! Go! Just leave me and Leone alone. -Go! You're free now. -Leave… leave… leave Leone out of this! [mockingly] Help! He's threatening me. Help! Help me! Don't try and turn him against me. I won't be responsible for my actions. -Help me! -I will not be responsible! Don't touch me, or I'll call the police, huh? -Really? -Okay. -Will you stop it? -Stop what? Enough, please. Will you stop acting like Leone's just your son? Leone is only my son. [percussion music playing] [Paolo] It's obvious. He looks just like me. Paolo! Paolo, this physical resemblance thing is a delusion that only exists in your pathetic, sick mind! -Leone loves music. -Ah! History, the mountains, all animals, just like I do. Sure. You love animals, particularly when you are barbecuing them. I'll ask the lawyer for custody of Leone. [laughs] You're so delusional, seriously. No judge in their right mind would grant you sole custody of a dog, let alone a child! Huh? Leone is my son. No. -Do you want to bet? -Sure, let's bet. Either way, we'll soon know for sure. Why? Because we'll… Because… because… because we'll know. You did a DNA test, didn't you? Yes. So what? Be careful, Paolo. After 20 years, you still don't know what I'm capable of. [Paolo] You can threaten me all you want! I've recorded everything. Go ahead! Threaten me! I recorded! Fuck. It didn't start. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck. Fuck! There's no mosaic in the sale. Ah! What kind of shop doesn't have a mosaic in the sale? ["Reverie" by Isaac Gracie playing] [Leone] So, you and I… What? I mean, are we together now? -Yes, we're in the same room. -No, be serious. [chuckles] Seriously. I don't know. You tell me. [inhales deeply] Well, I'd love to be your boyfriend. -So? -Well, so? So? [chuckles] -Do you want to be my girlfriend? -Mmm. -Is that a yes? -Yes. -Yes? Hmm? Yes? -Yes. Mmm, yes. -My gay boyfriend! -Oh, don't start that again. [chuckles] Don't be cross. -You promised you'd lock him in his room. -He's in his room. And it's locked? -Yes. -Okay. [chuckles] But, uh, you must've wondered at least once. Everyone's done it. I know I did. I thought I was in love with a girlfriend of mine. But then we kissed. And we just started laughing. [laughs] You? -Nothing? -I… did think about it and wondered… I even asked my parents. But their immediate answer was… [mockingly] …"Dear boy, if you were gay, you wouldn't be asking us now, would you?" [both chuckle] You can be whatever you want, as long as I'm the one you're into. [music intensifies] Are you absolutely sure your mum's not coming back? -Yes, absolutely sure. -Okay. [Anna] Text your dads. Tell them you're sleeping here. Okay. [Anna moans] -Is this your first time? -For me? Yeah. And you? [kisses] No. It's not, but with you it's going to be different. ♪ And darling, I'm just not okay ♪ [music continues] ♪ Hey, babe ♪ [music stops] [quirky music playing] [shower running] -Oh! -Oh no, come in, come in, come in. I'm done now. I'm gonna get dressed in my room. Come in. [Leone yawns] Leone, I'm sorry. Um… Yeah, so, I wanted to apologize for the way that I behaved the other day. I'm sorry. I was being a prick because I had this thing and I couldn't tell anybody, not even… myself. But for some reason, I managed to tell you. And now, I feel more… more free and much lighter. -We can be friends if you want. Or maybe… -[door opens] [keys clatter] Well, if you teach me to climb like you, then, uh… Okay, I'll teach you to climb like me. Come here. -Sorry. I'm still wet from my shower. -Yeah. [both chuckling] -Dario! -Mum! -[Leone] Open the door! -[Elisa] Dario, open this door! -Who knows what she might be thinking? -Dario! -What's up, Mum? -What's going on in this house? What is Dario doing in the bathroom with that boy? Why are you half-naked? [Leone] Open the door! I'll go out and say it. "Hi, Mum. I'm a homo!" You can't say that. She'll think we're having sex together. You can't. I'll jump out the window. Then you can do whatever the fuck you want. Open this door! Dario, open up! [Dario] Mum. Yes, you got it bang on. I'm gay. And thanks to Leone, I managed to face the truth and understand who I really am. -Mum, I'm gay. -Yeah, but tell her the other bit. Listen, Mr. "Other Bit." I don't care what you and your parents do in your home. -What's this got to do with my parents? -But this is a normal house. -Completely normal! -What's normal, Mum? -Not normal? What do you mean? -"Normal." Are we not allowed to say that? No, you can't say it, Mum! Am I allowed to want what's best for my children? Normal? Like Dad, shagging a girl barely older than me? -Or you, looking for cocks online? -Don't you dare! What do you know? You're just a kid. You're all just a bunch of kids! Okay. Okay. So, you go to your room. You get the hell out of here. -Leave my son alone! -No, he's staying, Mother! Dario, darling. You know you can talk to me about anything, don't you? I promise you it's absolutely normal to be confused at your age. You just have to avoid having any experiences you may regret, okay? Mum, this is the experience I want to have. Please, just… So last night, you and he were… No. Mum, you're ridiculous. You haven't understood a thing, as usual. Yes, actually, I'm in love with… your daughter. ["Impossible" by Nothing But Thieves playing] Okay. Now, wait. So… you, Dario, Leone… Enough! Go to school. All of you, get out of here! Out, out, out! One, two, three! Out. Go.

[clears throat] Come in, please. I'll just leave this here. [sighs deeply] I got this for you. For me? It's not exactly Prada, but I can't afford that at the moment. [chuckles] But it's something very similar. Almost… Almost the same. Yes, I can see. "Frada." That's… [clears throat] Um, thanks. Thank you, Paolo. Really. I really appreciate what you've done. It was a great gesture. Okay. Honestly, I didn't think… [exhales] …you'd give me the restaurant more or less for free. I, uh, only did it for Leone. Yes, of course, for Leone. Well, because what I really want anyway… I mean, what we both want is the well-being of… of our son. Yes. Why are you ashamed of saying it? Our son. He's our son. We were there when he was born. As he grew up, uh, when he took his first steps. -Learned how to ride a bike. -[chuckles] And fall of it. -Who thought he didn't need stabilizers? -It was definitely the right time. -He was more than old enough. -He wasn't even four years of age! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [Simone] No, I'm sorry. It's okay. Anyway, what matters is that we were there through all the difficult times. Yes, and we were there for all the important moments. [Paolo] Yes. But above all, we managed to bring him up with values, right? We raised him to be a responsible, independent, and compassionate person. Yes. -We did. -We can be proud of that, at least. Listen, so… [sighs] Sorry, Simone, if we didn't give a damn about the DNA before, why should it matter now? Huh? That's exactly what I think. Really? Paolo, to be honest, I… -I, uh… -Whatever happened is in the past now. I think it's time to grow up and move on like two responsible grown-ups, don't you? And with respect too. And with respect. Wow. We agree. -[chuckles] -[clears throat] You know, I was in his room earlier… And Leone has everything he knows in there, all of his belongings, his world. And I was thinking that it would be nice if he could feel at home both at your place and, uh, mine. At my place, Paolo? At my place. Yes, at yours. At mine, at yours. At mine… You're a great man, Paolo. I have to admit. [sighs] I still don't know how I'll react when I see him leaving the house. Why? 'Cause he'll come and see me once a week? That's what we're talking about. That's how it's gonna be anyway. Don't mess with me right now. What do you mean? Simone, we can think whatever we want about us, okay? And possibly, in the future, who knows, we might even care about each other again. But legally, Leone has to come and live with you. With me? With you! With me? [sighs] Let's not do this again. You're his biological father. Me? We know you are, Paolo! Stop it! You know very well it's you! Paolo, please don't joke about this stuff. -Stop it, Paolo! Don't joke. -Me? I'm not joking! -You really are an asshole sometimes. -I'd never joke about this. -Read this! -Read this! What the hell does this mean? I mean… Between us, we don't even share 0.1% of Leone's DNA. Oh my God. We're two strangers to him. -We're two strangers to our own son! -[groans] What the fuck does that mean? What are these papers? -Paolo… -What does it mean? -Is this a joke? What does this mean? -[shouts] Paolo! -What the hell does it mean? -Hey! What the hell does this mean? What the hell does this mean? [sobbing] Leone's here. -Hey. -[Paolo] Hi, Leo. What are you two doing here, in the same place? [exhales] -[Paolo clears throat] -What's going on? Sit down, Leo. We need to talk to you. [Simone] We have to explain something. Something happened that… Something we really didn't expect. No. -[Simone] Hey. -Hey. It's got my name on it. Yes, you name is here. Yes. Is that a test? Yes, it's a test. Yes. What test? -Uh… -The… uh… Of the… DNA? Yes. DNA. You actually tested our DNA? -Yes. -Without even asking me? -And how did you do it, though? -[Paolo sighs] You live here, sweetheart. There's traces everywhere. -A glass. Chewing gum… -Some hair on a brush. I don't believe this. [Simone] Leone, wait. I… I know it may sound like we overstepped. This was not our intention. I assure you we did it for your own good. All the crap you've given me my entire life. "We don't care about blood or DNA." "Our bond is based on love and sincerity." It was just a fat lie! Leone, maybe we made a mistake. Uh… But you have to understand that in Italian law, we needed to figure out how to best protect you. So you thought it best to take traces of my DNA and take them to a lab without even asking me? -Nice one. -[clapping] So, come on. Who won, then? Who's my father? Who's the winner? -[Paolo] Exactly. -[Leone] So? This is something we need to talk about very calmly. Paolo's right. It's… it's a very delicate matter. It doesn't look complicated from here. It's either you or you! Well, then? It's not me nor Paolo. The DNA test says that we're not your parents. [faintly] What the fuck are you saying? Listen, Leone. We're still trying to figure this all out… ourselves. That's why we called Tilly, and she's on her way here. Yes, your Dede owes us an explanation. -No. No. No. -Leone, let's talk about it calmly. -[Paolo] Calmly. -You want me to be calm? -[Paolo] Yes. -Be calm, huh? Calmly. Come on. You two are both insane. The both of you. [crying] -Leo, where are you going? Leo! -Wait, Paolo. Wait. [breath trembling] ["La Canzone Nostra" by Mace, Blanco, Salmo playing] [keys clatter] Oh well, fuck it. [song continues] [indistinct chattering] [Dario] Did you see? At least Jacopo tried. He did well. Well done, Jaco. I decided to start a new life. Listen, my sister told me you're not responding to her texts, so I told her that you were here. I hope I'm not causing any trouble. -I'll see you later. Well done. -Yeah. -I'll be right with you, I think. -See you. What's wrong, Leo? -Is everything all right? -Yeah. Yeah. Just go. I'll catch up with you. Just come. Promise me? Mm-hmm. [tense music playing] [thunder rumbling] [rain pattering] [straining] -Whoa! Leone! -Hey! There's no rope! What are you doing? Leone! What the fuck are you doing? [Dario] Leone. Hey. -[Jacopo] What do we do, Dario? -[Dario] Go and get the mats. -[Jacopo] Is this enough? -Get the blue ones as well. And put them on top. -[Jacopo] Why did you climb up like that? -I wanna go up more. -No, you can't go up. Come down! -Come down, Leone! -Come down! -[Jacopo] Where the fuck are you going? [Dario] Leone, you have to come down. You can't keep going. [Leone strains] -[Dario] Leone, please! -[Jacopo] Come down! -[Dario] Leone! -[Jacopo] You'll give us a heart attack! -Come down! -[Dario] Look at us! Leone, look at me. Come down! [Leone straining] [panting] [laughing softly] [Dario] Leone? Come down, slowly. Slowly! [Jacopo] Leone, you haven't got a rope. Please! You're going to hurt yourself. Okay, coming down. Coming down. -How's he going to come down? -Take the blue route, the big holds. The blue ones are all good. Use those. -Which holds? -[Dario] The white and the blue ones. That one's yellow! It's yellow. White and blue! -White and blue. -[Jacopo] Easy, Leo. [Leone] Oh… [Jacopo] Slowly, slowly, Leone. -[Dario] Come down. -Slowly, slowly, Leone. Leone, move slow! -[tense music plays] -Oh. -No! -[Dario] Leone! No! -[grunts] -[music intensifies] [gentle music playing] How are you, my love? What the hell happened? Why did you do it? [chuckles softly] I… [sighs] I think I… needed to be… by myself to clear my thoughts. Leone, you tripped out. That's not something you do by yourself. [chuckles] Same old Jaco. And now I feel guilty because I gave you those pills. It's not your fault, Jaco. I did it on my own. I guess… [groans] Oh. -What are you doing? -Just lie back down. I've never told you, but I really love you, my friend. [chuckles] Finally. Come here. Give us a hug. -Gently. Okay. Gently. -[Jacopo] Yes, gently, gently. [groans] -Listen, we called your parents. -What the fuck, Jaco? We had to. Come on. -Okay, but I'm fine, no? -Yes, you're absolutely fine. Leone. My son's name is Leone. How many Leones do you have here? -I understand. -Leone Ferrari. They told us he's here. -Are you his mother? -No, I'm his aunt. -But he's his father. -I'm his father. -Where is he? -Leone Ferrari. Room 103, first floor. 103, first floor. 103, first floor. 103, first floor. -Where's the first floor? -[Monica] That way. Leone, my darling. Are you still alive? How are you? Are you okay? -Yes, I'm fine. -What have you done? -Hey, Aunt Monica. -What have you done, sweetie? Huh? -I fell. -Hi, guys. -Fell from where? -Anyway, he only has a few bruises. His CT was all right, so… Yes, the doctor said he'll be able to go home tomorrow. -[Monica sighs] -No. I want to go home tonight, please. -Shh. -What on earth happened? [chuckles] Nothing, Dad. I climbed up a wall on my own. -A wall? -Without protection. I'm so sorry, Dad. I really screwed up. We've all screwed up recently. Please forgive us, my love. Forgive us, darling. It'll all be fine. It'll be fine. Okay? It'll all be fine. [Paolo kisses] Oh God, I think I'm gonna pass out. Somebody get me a chair. [groans] -Shall we go? -I just lost 40 years of my life! Mr. Ferrari, we're off. Yes, we'll take care of him. Thanks. Go home and rest. Bye. -Thank you. Good night. -If you need anything-- We'll call you. Thank you so much. -Bye, Leo. -[kisses] EMERGENCY ROOM This scan doesn't seem like it's-- Good evening. Leone Ferrari. He was admitted not long ago. Where is he? -And who are you? -I'm his father. -No, actually, his father already arrived. -I'm his other father. Tell me where I can find him. Extended family. -Okay. Room 103, first floor. -Thanks. [panting] And where… See? That kid has two fathers. And mine left to go to America. Leone! [panting] Sweetheart, how are you? -Hey, Dad. -He's fine. He's fine. What's with the face? I'm fine. -How did it happen? -[Paolo] Nothing. He just tried to kill himself by attempting to climb a 10-metre climbing wall without any sort of protective gear or harnesses. [crying softly] Oh, Leo! I know we're bad parents, but please don't ever do that again. It was an accident, Dad. I wasn't trying to kill myself. Oh God, you scared the hell out of me. Does Aunt Monica know? About what? About the DNA. Of course I know. [chuckles] And your opinion? What do you want me to say? Leo, it doesn't change anything at all. -Of course it doesn't change anything. -Of course. Why should anything change? [Simone chuckles] -[gentle music playing] -[sniffles] [sobbing] So, what now? What do we do? Now we have to speak to Tilly. She owes us an explanation. So my cocktail didn't work at all, then? The cocktail? -It's just a family thing. -Yeah. Good evening. Leone Ferrari, is he here? Yes. Yes. And who are you? I'm his Dede. His Dede. His Dede. His Dede. -God, I don't understand. -His Dede? -I don't… His Dede, yes. -His Dede! His Dede! -But I don't know what that is, madam. -His mamma? - Yes! -Ah. -[male nurse] Of course. -To be fair, we were missing the mother. So, he's still in room 103, still on the first floor. -And where is it, please? -First floor. Thank you! No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Uh, you can wait here. -What? -Wait here. Who's this? The third father? How extended is this family? [Tilly panting] -Hi. -[Leone] Hi, Dede. Hi, Tilly. Honey, are you okay? -How did this happen? -I fell. [chuckles] But I'm fine. How did he fall? [Paolo clears throat] What's going on? What happened? Sit down, Tilly. It's best if you sit down. -[chair scrapes] -[Simone] Yes, Tilly. Sit down. [Monica] Well, what's about to go down is some real family business, so I think I should leave you guys alone to deal with it. Besides, I'd rather not know anything about the… cocktail. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye, Monica. -Bye. [Leone groans] [Paolo] Tilly? Can you explain this? These are the results? Can you help us understand? Leone's old enough. This concerns him too. He has the right to know. Go ahead. This is a surprise for me too. What I mean is… I hoped this day would never come. I had my doubts, but when Leone was born, he looked so much like Paolo, I thought, "Thank goodness. Everything went well." Uh, listen, Tilly. Tilly. Tilly, focus. Get to the point. -Come on. Huh? -Please, go on. [Tilly] We'd been trying for two years, remember? Every failure was heartbreaking for all of us. That was our… our seventh attempt, and it was our… our last embryo. After that, we would've had to have started all over again. [sighs deeply] But in the meantime, in those two years, a lot of things happened in my life. I… My husband… Stephen and I were… were separating, divorcing… You… you know how it is. But… but Leroy and I had… had just met. And then when the pregnancy started, I… I thought the embryo had finally taken root. And I… I never thought about it again. I was always careful to follow the doctor's instructions. I always refrained from intercourse post-insemination. Always? Hello! Always! Except once. It happened only once. Unexpectedly. You should've told us. -How? -How? [crying] How could I ruin your joy? It was just a doubt and… and… Besides, you had always said that if it were possible, you would've adopted. So, Dede… Who's my father? [Leroy] Hi! They let me in, finally. -Good evening, everyone. -[Tilly groans] -Hey, kid. How you feeling? -Leroy. Honey, I… I have something to tell you. Please, come with me. Baby? -[mouthing] -[Simone sighs] [Simone] Leone, I… I really don't know what to say. Where do we go from here? I don't know. I guess it depends on what Leroy says as well. What do you want Leroy to say? Who cares about what Leroy thinks? -No, of course. -He's our son. We've raised him up! We've raised you up. Okay, Leone? You are our son. [footsteps approaching] I'm sorry, I… I had to tell him first. I… couldn't imagine him finding out from anyone else. So is Leroy him? Oh no, no, no. No. Oh God! [chuckles] I am so sorry. I'm so sorry if that's what you understood. It's not Leroy, no. -It's not Leroy? -[scoffs] Tilly! Tilly, listen. Please. My head is spinning from all of this, okay? You have to help us understand. Just tell us who is the father of our son. When you have been married for ten years… When you have had three children with a man, you can't just end it overnight. There are some traces of love that… that still remain. [Tilly sighs] Stephen? -Stephen? -Your ex-husband? Stephen? I'm sorry. I'm ashamed of myself. [sighs] [emotional music playing] [crying] Leone. I carried you for nine months. But I was so happy to give you to Simone and Paolo because I knew how much you would be loved. I didn't tell you who your father was because I didn't think it mattered. Simone and Paolo made you who you are. Not me. Not Stephen. That's all that matters. Can you forgive me? [gentle music playing] [laughing] [sobbing] -[Leone] Leroy? Can you film us? -Oh yeah! - [Leone] I forgave Tilly. - Come on! [Leone] We all forgave her. None of us could really be that angry with her. After all, if she hadn't had that moment of weakness with her ex-husband, I wouldn't be here to tell you about it. -See you. -[Leone] Bye, Dede. So, thanks to Dede, I found out that my biological father was Stephen. -Ah. -Gently. Gently. [Leone] Even though I'll never be able to meet him. Tilly believes that Stephen has returned to being the invisible spirit he was before he was born and now illuminates the Milky Way. I'll think about that when I look at the night sky. The problem… [sighs] …as usual, was what the Italian legal system thought. [laughing] Luckily, in some special cases, adoption can be requested. And finally the lawyer managed to get both of them on my birth certificate after all. [both laughing] [Leone] And so, in the end, this strange family of mine was put back together again. Well, sort of put back together again. Because in the end, we are a family like any other. And sometimes, families explode. My life has changed a bit. I now have two homes. I spend some nights with my dad Simone and his new steady partner and some others with my dad Paolo and… No, it's just Paolo. They're not together anymore. They love me the same as before, and that's all I could ask for. We've had so many adventures together. And firstly, we are and will always be a family. [crowd applauding] So proud. I wanted to tell the story of my family and all of its disasters because I would like the law to take into account that, well, a birth is the result of the complicity of millions of people, men and women linked by invisible threads that are also a little tangled. Yeah. Yes. But the protagonists of this story are my parents who are my real parents. Simone and Paolo. Thank you for your… for having me in your lives, for caring, and for guiding me through this strange thing that is… that is life. Bravo! -[girl] Go, Leone! -[whooping] ["Ode to Mom" by Hannah Georgas playing] ♪ If there is magic on this planet It's in the water ♪ ♪ If there is magic on this planet It's in the water ♪ ♪ If there is magic on this planet It's in the water ♪ ♪ If there is magic on this planet It's in my blood ♪ ♪ I can still hear you playing ♪ ♪ I can still hear you playing ♪ ♪ I can still hear you playing ♪ ♪ I can still hear you playing ♪ ♪ So let's drive, let's pass this by ♪ ♪ Forget what we did and forget why ♪ ♪ We laughed in the first place ♪ ♪ Why we laughed in the first place ♪ ♪ If there is magic on this planet It's in the water ♪ ♪ If there is magic on this planet It's in the water ♪ ♪ If there is magic on this planet It's in my blood ♪ [song ends] [gentle music playing] [Leone] When does love really end? When you come home in the evening, and you find his socks lying around, and you no longer think he's lazy, but you just want to strangle him with those smelly old socks. When you finally realize that… [sighs] …that you no longer understand each other. [chuckles softly] That you're going in two different directions. [Leone] But if love ends, was it really love? It was love, yeah, which in the best-case scenario turns into friendship, and in the worst-case, into resentment. [Leone] What would your life have been like if I hadn't been born? I don't even want to think about it! What kind of question is that? Come on, Leone! Without you in our lives? Give me a break! It would have been a life without joy, without colour, a life in black and white. Can you imagine life alone with him? Ugh… No! Have you turned it off, huh? Turn it off. [sniffs] Listen, Leone. Listen up. Your father and I probably won't love each other again like we used to, but our love generated you, a boy who's now here with us, alive, in front of me. And he deserves all the love in the world.
