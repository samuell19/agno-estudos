The Redhead and the Cowboy 1951 Well, that ain't him. That's our man. Come on. Hi, Gil. Hi. I'm sorry, ma'am. There's no damage. What'll it be, Gil? She new here? Who? That girl over at Goldie's table. Yeah. Pretty, ain't she? Yeah. Corn. Corn? Heh, heh. Drink rye, man. We're celebrating. The Yanks have gotten Nashville and Savannah and the Rebs are high-tailing it out of Georgia. To Ulysses S. Grant and his blue pants army. Yeah. Drink, mister. So maybe you don't like the way the war's going, ah? Maybe I don't. He's a Johnny Reb. Stinking Copperhead. Pick up that glass. What goes on here? Here's the man won't drink to our victory. What's the matter? Are you trying to start something, Kyle? Not yet, I ain't. If he doesn't drink-- I'll do the talking. Look, I've been shoved around once tonight. That's enough. I buy my own whiskey, I drink to who I want and what I want and no bunch of saloon soldiers is gonna tell me different. Saloon sol-- Move. I said move down to the other end of the bar. Now. You too. I've been watching you, Kyle. I should think you might be out watching where you might do some good instead of hanging around saloons. Where would that be? Roads outside of town, maybe? You wanna make a complaint? No. No, I'm just-- I'm just stating something, that's all. Roads are full of trouble these days. Renegades, outlaws, Indians. Got so a man isn't safe after dark. Yeah, it seems that way. You have a brush with someone? Ah. Hm. I've had a few close ones myself. You see, I'm a cattle buyer. I have to ride these roads day and night. And now with a Southern troop raiding the territory, no telling what might happen. Yeah, I've heard rumors about it. Oh, they've been here all right. Burned up a few ranches out of Soda Springs last week. Have a drink? No politics attached. Well, I've got no interest in politics one way or another. Here. Me neither. Just cattle. Sure wish I could spot me a fat herd somewhere. You know, every time I see some cattle they're already spoken for. Picked up a few scrubs here and there. I was saying cattle are getting scarcer than gold. Or good-looking redheads. I admire your taste. Another drink? No. Heh. Think I'll play a little poker. I'll get it. I like buying my own drinks, mister. Well, I asked you to have a drink with me. All right, I'll flip you for it. What'll it be? Heads or tails? Heads. ( coin drops ) Heads it is. Well, maybe my luck's changing, huh? Thank you. I made a mistake, mister. There was some damage after all. Oh? Nothing serious, I hope. Nothing a glass of wine at the table couldn't repair. Excuse us. Gladly. Better than poker anytime. Oh, yeah. Uh, Gus, send over a bottle of the lady's favorite wine, will you? All right. Well, how come you changed your mind? Maybe I like a man who stands up for what he believes. Now, how do you know what I believe, huh? I don't. And I don't care. That's better. Do you--? Do you always flip a coin three times before you call it? What, did I do that? Oh. You know, that's very interesting. What? That you would be watching. I was thinking-- Here you are. Thanks. You were thinking what? I was thinking it might be nice if you told me your name. It's Kyle. Gil Kyle. Mine's Candace. Candace Bronson. Candace. Well, that's a very pretty name. Here's to it. You know, you don't talk like the other cowpokes around here. Mm-hm? Well, I ought to. I've been in and around these hills most of my life. Cattle? Mm-hm. When I'm working. And you're not working now? Yes. Very seriously. At what? Trying to figure out what makes your eyes snap the way they do. It's very pretty. Can't we talk about something more important than my eyes? Why, sure, we'll talk about your nose. That's very pretty too. Also very unimportant. What brought you in here tonight? Me? Oh, now, you-- You are new here, now, aren't ya? Huh? Not that new. New enough to want to know something about you. Well, not very much to tell. When I got money, I like to spend it, and when I don't I work. That's all. And politics? I got none. Ah, drink your wine, huh? Hm. I guess I better. We seem to have run out of conversation. Mm, I don't know. Maybe we're getting down to what really counts. Like how many Mondays in a Thursday, for instance? Like, like what? It's a riddle. Figure it out. How, how many--? Ahem. Wait a minute. How many Mondays in a Thursday? What, there's an answer to it? I just made it up. Mm. All right. Suppose we both stop twisting words, huh? Look, I got two months' pay in my pocket that's just itching to be spent. There's enough there to buy us the biggest evening the Golden Trail's ever seen. Here you are: wine, song, dance, anything you like. Well, I haven't heard you say "yes." I'll-- I'll give you my answer as soon as I come back, Mr. Kyle. I mean, Gil. How do I know you're coming back? With two months' pay in your pocket? I'll be back. As soon as I powder this unimportant nose of mine. How many Mondays in a Thursday? Eleven. One for each state in the Confederacy. Memorize: broken sombrero, 13, 26. Say it! Broken sombrero, 13, 26. That's right. We're counting on you to deliver. Counting on you-- Del-- Deliver message. Message. Now, you'd a done better to stay and finish that bottle of wine with me. That a friend of yours? No. No, I never saw him before. It was dark. I just came in to-- To-- To powder your nose? Is he dead? There's only one way to find out. Yeah, he's dead. He's real dead. Sorry. Wrong door. I wouldn't move if I were you. You come in town looking for trouble, you found it. He was there when I come in. Alive? Yeah, he was muttering something about a message to be delivered. What sort of message? I'll ask the questions, mister. Why don't you ask the girl? She was talking to him before I come in. What girl? Well, the gi-- Hey, did you see a girl come in? I wasn't watching. I was at the bar having a drink. What brought you in here? I asked the bartender. I thought he said this door. Yeah. He came in to powder his nose. I don't think Judge Simmons is gonna find this so funny tomorrow morning. Oh, yeah? Heh. Oh, I don't know. Any idea who he is? Yeah, roll him over. Why, you stupid-- You--! Drop it. I'm sorry it had to be this way, sheriff. I didn't kill our friend here. Like I told you, I never saw him before. Kick your gun over. I'm coming back right quick with some proof. Maybe then you'll believe me. Ah, that was a cool one. Let me outta here. Sorry. Imagine my being so clumsy with a gun, a man like me that's been around guns all his life. Candace! Miss Bronson! Hey, you. What's your hurry? What happened to you? It was Kyle. Hey, Rusty, you take Frank and get some more men and bring 'em over to the office. You don't know this country very well, do you, ma'am? I've been waiting for some time. Mr. Kyle. What's the matter? Are you surprised to see me out of jail? What are you doing? Going back to town. No, I can't go back there. On the other hand, if you don't, I can't. They think you killed him. You didn't help matters any running out in such a hurry, you know. Well, if I hadn't, whoever did it would have killed me too. No, you know, I figure you left because you had some kind of a-- Kind of a message to deliver. That'd be nearer the truth, wouldn't it? Oh, no, wait. I can't tell you what it is I'm doing, but it's important. Very important. It's pretty hard for me to figure anything more important than my neck right about now. Oh, you'll make a deal with me. I've only a few miles more. Let me go. I'll be back in the morning, and I'll clear you then with the sheriff, I promise. Ah. And after you're cleared, we can still have that evening you were talking about. The biggest the Golden Trail's ever seen. Mm, well, that-- You know, that's-- that's a mighty attractive proposition. Oh, on the other hand, if I did turn ya over to the sheriff, how do I know you'd tell the truth? That's right. I could lie your neck right into a rope. But tomorrow morning... I'm thinking more about tomorrow night. Come on, let's go. This is it, isn't it? Yes. I'll only be a moment. Yeah. Thank you. If I'd had more time, I'd have worn different clothes. Yeah, well, they're not exactly the best thing for riding, but they're kinda pretty, you know? Not much activity around here. Gil... Huh? You wait outside, please. You can trust me. All right. Mr. Carson? Mr. Carson. Wonder why the door's open. He's expecting you, isn't he? Yes. Yeah, well, why don't you go on in? No. Oh, there's nobody home. He should be here. Well, let's let a little light in here, huh? Where do you suppose he is? Oh, I don't know. Probably stepped out somewhere. Doesn't know he's gonna have a couple of guests for breakfast. See if he has any eggs. There's some bread. What's this? Hey! It's hot. What was that? It's a dog? Mr. Carson? Easy now. Ah, look, the windows is open. Kinda looks like he left in a hurry. There's something wrong. Here boy. Here fella. Carson? Two corpses. You're getting more than you bargained for. Gil... I, um, I guess you were right when you said there was trouble around. Put him outside, Gil. I'm afraid of him. All right. Come on, boy. Come on, fella. What's that? Let's have it. Here. Let go! You're full of cat, aren't you? Well, I don't know about you, but I'm still gonna eat. Coffee's on. Hey, what are you looking for anyway? Something to tell me where I should go. He knew how important it was. You think he had time to leave a farewell note? Hey, why don't you quit playing soldier, come on get some food, huh? Come on, fella. That's a boy. Look, the lock's been blown off. Well, whoever came had to-- Had to shoot their way in. Then Carson knew they were coming. Yeah, it looks like he put up a fight. There's a bullet hole in the shutter, you see? Ah, there's a couple more in the wall here. He must have had time to leave a message. Ah. He'd know I had to go on. You're not going anywhere but back to town. Yeah, the sheriff will give you all the protection you need and I'll be-- I'll be happy to get lawful again. Ah, there's some meat here. Here, fella. You'd like some of this, huh? Okay, I-- You really had a tough time, haven't you? Huh? Oh, feels like one of his ribs is broken. Hm. He doesn't belong here. He doesn't? No. Lazy Y Ranch. Got the brand scratched on his collar, see? You're probably right. I don't remember seeing a dog around here before. You'd probably be hightailing it for home right now if you didn't feel so bad, huh, boy? Lazy Y... Is that the big ranch near Brockville? Yes, it's about 18 miles north-east of here, just short of the Squaw River. A fella by the name of-- I think it's Barrett owns it. It's a man, alone. Wait here.Morning. Well, I thought you'd be clear out of the territory by now. No need to draw, Kyle. I'm full of peace and mildness, like to keep it that way. Yeah? What are you doing stopping here? Cattle. Thought I told you I was in the cattle business. I was riding by, I saw a herd far down the valley. I said to myself, "Jeffers, those are for you." Course, the idea of breakfast wasn't exactly repugnant to me. I saw that smoke coming out of the chimney. Carson around? Oh, relax, Kyle. I give you my word I won't mention the Golden Trail. Live and let live, that's my motto. Hot beef. Molasses. Coffee bubbling away. Well, my luck holds out, Carson'll sell me his steers. Hey, uh, where is Carson anyway? Watering the stock? I couldn't say. What's he to you, friend? How'd it happen you rode all night? Well, I let out before the sheriff got to ask me how come I was so clumsy. He had all his steam up, I'll say that for him. Not only the dead man but you had to knock out his deputy. When I left he was swearing in half the town, issuing orders to shoot on sight. You're gonna make the war look like a border incident. Maybe. You suppose the girl would like to eat too? I saw her horse outside with yours. Since I did there's no reason why she can't come out, is there? Miss Candace? You're having bad luck with that girl. With bodies too. How did this one die? Northern mob. See this? Bad business. Man has an ounce of sympathy for the South, they call him a Copperhead. He ends up full of bullet holes. How do you know there was more than one? Mm? Oh, the bullet holes in the front room wall there. They came from different directions. It's pretty foolish of you getting mixed up the same way twice. Any idea which way the girl is heading? No. What's it to you? Nothing. I was just wondering about your alibi. Yeah. Somebody better. Was Carson dead when you got here? Yeah. I'm thinking you need that girl more than ever. Why are you so interested in the girl? No special reason. Well, I'm thinking there is. Do you know where the girl's gone? Maybe. All right, let's face up our hands. We're both on the same side of the table. You wanna find the girl, keep her safe to clear you back in town. I want her to deliver the message she got at the saloon last night. Why? Since you're neutral the details don't concern you. Well, the girl does. Well, I give you my word of honor I don't wanna see her harmed any more than you do. I'm to believe you're for the South too? I helped you last night, didn't I? Figured you were with her, she needed you. You lead me to where she's going, then you can have her, take her back to town with you. How do I know you won't put a slug in me the minute you catch sight of her? You don't. But from the way I saw you handle that gun last night, I'd say it'd be a mighty unhealthy thing to try. 'Course there's another alternative. Well, what's that? I turn you over to the law. I think you'd better decide pretty fast or the sheriff and his posse will do it for you. They'll be here in a few minutes. You just got yourself a guide. Who's that? It ain't Carson, for sure. That's Kyle up ahead. This is it. Good. What do you fellas want? We'd like to see, uh, Mr. Barrett. What for? We're cattle buyers. Got no cattle for sale. Well, you mind if we borrow a little water? For our horses. All right. Thanks. Can we have a talk with Mr. Barrett anyway? He might have something coming up. He don't talk to strangers now or later. Howdy, miss. Hello. Did you come to see my father? No, not exactly. No, I came to see you. You did? Yes. Yes, I heard there was a very pretty girl in these here parts so I figured to do some courting. 'Course, I'd have to ask your father first, wouldn't I? I already got a sweetheart. Have you? His name is Carrot. He's a rabbit. Oh, well, I'm very disappointed. I-- No, I hadn't heard about him. What do you got here? Ah, that's a real Indian doll, isn't it? Pretty feathers on it and everything. Oh, I wish I had one like that. Mary, come here. And quick. Yes, Ma. Get inside that house. And stay there. Is that Mrs. Barrett? She don't wanna talk to you neither. Have 'em come in, Ned. Mrs. Barrett? My name is Jeffers. This is my partner, Gil Kyle. We were wondering if Mr. Barrett had any cattle for sale. No, he hasn't. Oh, that's a pity. We're offering top prices. There's a big demand for beef. We'll take anything. Scrubs, or-- Told you once we haven't anything. Hi there. Get back where I said. Oh, that's a mighty pretty little gal, ma'am. She your daughter? She sure put Gil here in his place. Turned him down cold for a rabbit. She told me. Well, I-- Now, hope I didn't do any harm, ma'am. I-- I only meant to amuse her. You amused her. I mean, little enough fun kids get these days. Well, I guess we'd better push along, Gil. We got a lot of ground to cover. Thanks for your trouble, Mrs. Barrett. Um, by the way, you didn't happen to see a young lady riding by here, did you? Pretty and redheaded. She was supposed to meet with us hereabouts. I saw no one. Oh, that's too bad. Uh, Gil here is mighty anxious to meet up with her. In fact, uh, he'd like to marry her if she'd hold still long enough. Anybody'd get married these days is a fool. Well, I don't think you'd say that, ma'am, if you saw her, now. She's-- She's smart as well as pretty. Smart enough to tell you no, that's for sure. Mm, yes. Well, that's the way it goes, ma'am. You know, one day it's yes, next day it's no. Trying to figure her out is like asking how many Mondays in a Thursday. Might be these men are thirsty. They've been on the road. You got any tea, or a bit of food? We got nothing in the house. It's all right, Mr. Barrett. We've eaten. Ah, I see you've had an accident. You've been laid up long? Three days. Leg's broken. Oh. How'd that happen? Fell off his horse. I've been riding 30 years without a slip, then one day I find my face in a clump of sage brush. That's too bad. You say you two are cattle buyers? That's right. Have you tried Bar X? You mean the Carson ranch towards Golden Trail? Yeah, we did. Earlier this morning. Fact is he-- He sent us to you. Carson did? I already told 'em we got no cattle. We got work 'round here. If you men are finished I'm asking you to go. Sorry to have troubled you, Mrs. Barrett. Why did you make me ask 'em in? Why? Because they're just what I figured they was. Yankee spies. You heard 'em trying to trick us. And you're gonna do what? Shoot 'em dead? Be a hero? There's a war on, woman. That all you can think of? War? There's nothing else? You wanna wind up full of holes like Carson? Or come home and find your wife and child charcoal corpses, the whole house burned down like they did the Frasers? Look! Oh, that's very kind of you, ma'am, but I couldn't think of taking that from you. No, it just wouldn't be right for me to take it. Oh, we got lots more. Yeah? Daddy gave one to a pretty lady a little while ago. Well, your daughter just gave us a good luck piece, ma'am. We both thank you. Well, you pulled the right string. They gave one of those to the girl. What do you make of it? Any ideas? Maybe. Well, where do you suppose it came from? It's Navaho country. That's a pretty big territory. Yeah. You know, we might get a line on it at the trading post. Trading post, yeah. Where's that? It's 15 miles ahead. You know, I'm thinking if the girl went that way that's mighty dangerous country. Then what we need is a shortcut. You know any? Yeah, I know several. One way's-- What's the matter? What am I telling you for? You might decide you don't need a guide any more. Come on. We're gonna climb that? You wanted a shortcut. That could be sheriff and his posse. Now, they come a long way. Must want my neck pretty bad. Mine too, by now. We'll wait. They can't spot us up here. Sure glad to get off that horse. Well, now that shouldn't be much of a ride for a cattle-buyer. If you're on the girl's side like you said, how come you don't know the seven passwords? I do. Why didn't you use them back at the Barrett's? Well, I figured the girl had been there already. They were jumpy enough. It would've only made them more suspicious. Why don't you know where the girl's going? The system's set up that way. Each messenger knows the next post, nothing more. That's so nobody can give it away. The golden trail was figured to be the weakest link, so I was sent there. Well, somebody should know something about it. Somebody does, at Confederate headquarters. You're pretty quick with the answers, aren't you? They've gone into the woods. Let's go. No, there's lots of time. We got a head start. I'm thinking of the girl riding those roads alone. Yeah. I'm thinking of her too. For my own reasons. She's got trouble. Got some trouble,h, and we gonna partner? help her out of it. Hey, what do you know. It's a gal. Yeah. Saw you up the road a piece, ma'am, but figured you for a cowpoke. The horse went lame. Well, that's too bad. I'll take a look at him for you. You got any idea which leg he was a-favoring? Yeah. Left foreleg. This one? Why, he's picked up a rock there in the frog of his foot. I can get it out for you, but he'll probably be lame for a while. Which way you heading? Uh, home. My father's place. We've got a ranch about four miles ahead. We'll take you there. You can, uh, ride double with me. You're very kind. I don't wanna inconvenience you. Oh, no inconvenience, ma'am. None at all. A lady wants to get to where she's a-going, and we're gonna fix it so she can do just that. Now, if I could find me something to pry that stone out with... I, um, didn't know there was any ranches in this part of the country, ma'am. What's the name of your father's place? Uh, it's called, uh, the Double O. Double O, huh? Yeah. Must be new. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Not very big. Will the ladies there go around dressed like you, ma'am? Not exactly. These are my brother's clothes. Guess they don't fit very well. I think they fit just fine. I'll bet she'd do it again if you gave her the chance. Ah, shut up. Hey! Take them horses around the back. Come here. Now look, miss, there ain't no reason why we can't settle this thing peaceful-like. We ain't a-looking for trouble, no more than you are. Just wanna make a deal with you. What kind of a deal? Well, a swap, sort of. You answer us a couple of questions, and in return we'll forget what we know about you. What could you know about me? Well, for one thing, you're carrying a Confederate message in Union territory. Now, some people might even call that spying. What makes you think that? We've been watching you ever since you left Golden Trail. Saw you at Carson's and at the Barrett's. Even saw you give your friend a slip. Now, what kind of way is that to treat a lady? Especially when we was just a-coming to an understanding. Nobody shoves me and-- Shut up! Now, get outside there. Keep an eye out for the road. Did he hurt you, ma'am? Got a bad temper, Perry has. It's a-gonna get him into trouble one of these days. Now to get back to our deal. The main thing we'd like to know is where that Confederate outfit of yours is holed up at. I don't know anything about them. Maybe we'd better work back to that after you answer a couple of easier questions. Like for instance, where was you heading? Now, you ought to know that. Red Rock Canyon. That's better. She's lying! Red Rock's noways near here. I told you to get outside. You better keep your answers straight, ma'am. It'll save us all a lot of time. Now, to get back to where you was a-going. Hey, Brock. Two men riding this way. You know them? One of them could be the cowpoke we seen at Carson's. With her. Yeah? Gil. Gil. Howdy. Hi. It, uh, could be we're-- We're kind of lost here. Could be. Where you heading for? We're trying to spot some herds. There's supposed to be a ranch around here, isn't there? Might be. You, uh-- You work around these parts? I'm out looking for strays. GIL: What ranch? Double O. Back across the hills. I don't suppose they might have some cattle for sale, do you? As far as I know. That's what they're in business for. Yeah, well, uh... thanks. Thanks for the information. What a minute. Here. Seems I've seen you two before. Where? Little scramble I had coming in to Golden Trail. What are your names? Brock. Perry. I know this pair too. They're mercenaries working out of Fort Jackson. They're after the thousand-dollar reward for the location of the Red Troop. You didn't give me much of a chance last night, did you? Gil. I'll take care of them. Get the horses. Please. Sure don't know how they picked you for this job. Where's your horse? They put him around back. You're a fine pair of patriots, killing old man Carson and knifing the other one in the back at the saloon. What's wrong with him? He picked up a rock. All right, come on, we'll take a look. Follow us, but keep it a distance. Or you'll answer to Fort Jackson. Gil, he shot them. Shouldn't think you'd have much sympathy for them after the way they roughed you up. We're going with you. Thanks, Gil. Well, somebody's gotta help you delivery that message. It kind of looks like you can't do it alone. Let's go. Who is that man? Oh, him? Why, he's a cattle-buyer. Just like you're a dance-hall girl. Now, the post is up that far canyon. Well, there it is. We don't buy these, ma'am, we sell them. How many Mondays in a Thursday? Follow me. Everybody. Wait here. Well, looks like you've reached the end of your journey. I hope so. Welcome. Merely a precaution, gentlemen. They'll be returned to you later. This is yours? Yes. May I ask where you got it? Are you Mr. Lamartine? Thousand pardons. I should've introduced myself. I am Lamartine. You, uh got this where? From Mr. Barrett. So I was expecting Mr. Barrett. Is there reason he could not come? He has a broken leg. He fell from his horse. Carson sent you all? Mr. Carson was dead when we got to the ranch this morning. He was shot in the back. These are difficult times. You, then, are the young lady from Golden Trail. Candace Bronson. And these gentlemen? This is Mr. Kyle, a friend. Mr. Kyle. And Mr. Jeffers. Without their help, I wouldn't have gotten here. Mr. Jeffers. You have a message for me? Oh, come, my dear, no longer need for concern. There are 11 Mondays in a Thursday. One for each state in the Confederacy. Well, I'm glad we finally got that question answered. The message. Broken sombrero, 13-26. Broken sombrero, 13-26. It seems to me, Miss Bronson, you've done an excellent job. May I extend the appreciation and gratitude of a humble soldier? Thank you. And now if you'll excuse me a moment, come with me, Mr. Jeffers. I believe I have something that will interest you. Betien, three more places for dinner. We have guests. Well, kind of looks like our friend Jeffers was expected. I still don't know if I trust him. Why? The way he killed those two men. Well, war makes everybody a little quick on the trigger. That's a little fancy for these parts. I'll be glad to sit down to a nice, quiet dinner. Could be this is gonna be too quiet. How come you got mixed up in a thing like this? Oh, I don't know. Maybe I just wouldn't admit the South was losing the war. Still no reason for a girl to start playing soldier. My father was killed at Antietam. My brother's in a Union prison camp. I wanted to do something, so they assigned me to the job at the Golden Trail. You're a brave girl. Will you accept the respects of a-- Of a humble cowpoke? What about you, Gil? I'm going back to town right after dinner. You're going with me. I will. I gave you my word. Yeah. You and I, we, um-- We had a date with a bottle of wine, remember? Yeah, it kind of looks like we're gonna have to have it here instead of the Golden Trail. Ah, I see you like a good glass. So do I. I don't cotton to a man who cries "when." If he's gotta worry about drinking too much, he's not to be trusted when he does. I might as well drink as fight this kind of war. Oh, come, sir, it can't be that distasteful. I can do without the knife-stabbings, the terrorizing of civilians. That goes for both sides. Agreed. Agreed. But what we seek here, Mr. Jeffers, has been a source of violence even in times of peace. Sir, I'm ready. Good. Join us. You cannot help but be interested. What both sides seek, sir: gold. Only we do not dig it from the ground. Instead our good friends of the Union Army supply it in bullion, wrapped and corded. I have but to carry it away. Look here, sir. Broken sombrero. Code for "Attack northern gold train at dawn tomorrow." Points 13 and 26 become coordinates. We have the point of attack. The bivouac of the train, sir, should be in this general area, some two or three miles short of the attack point. My troop, at present, is at Ramada Canyon. Here, Mr. Jeffers. Ho-ho! This is excellent. Truly cooperative on the part of the North. See how the narrow trail widens into a valley? Room for attack. My men will move out tonight. At dawn tomorrow, they'll be here waiting. Surprise. Surprise, my friend, the element many afeared leaders utilized. Sometimes it was just advantage when he was outnumbered. Quite true. As a matter of fact, I've already sent my Indian scout to ascertain the train's strength. He'll be back, I'm sure, before we finish dinner. Miss Bronson, should like again to express the indebtedness of the Confederacy and my personal admiration for your constancy. The message was of singular importance to us. Betien. Contained information which will enable my men to capture a Northern gold train in the morning. Thus supply the South with means to buy things we badly need. Riffles, gun powder, ammunition. Uh, we'll want wine and brandy glasses. Now, what do you mean "your men"? Troop of Confederate soldier encamped nearby, Mr. Kyle. Ramada Canyon, to be exact. Your journey, Miss Bronson, was all the more remarkable since one of your companions is a Union intelligence officer. Major Jeffers. But that's impossible. He helped me get here. Naturally, my dear, he wanted you to lead him to me. So you lied back at Carson's. I told you I didn't wanna see her harmed, I still don't. You think using her to get at the South isn't harming her? Our genial friend here has no more to do with the South than I have. Colonel Lamartine was once a Confederate officer. He is now a renegade, a deserter, leading a troop of deserters. The South is just as anxious to catch him as I am. Come, come, major, surely you can't expect anyone to believe that. Does this place look like a soldier's headquarters to you? No reason a soldier can't be comfortable. On the loot from half a dozen burned out ranches. He's gonna attack the gold train, all right, those are his orders. But the South will never see the gold. I'm disappointed in you, major. Most disappointed. Not because of your effort to discredit me, but for the way you've trapped yourself with your own words. If I've betrayed my superiors, as you say, how do you account for this? A copy of your orders, sir. Word for word, your description, the time and day of your arrival at Fort Jackson. All said to me from Richmond within the last few days. If you like, Mr. Kyle, you may verify my statement. And you, Miss Bronson. I don't need to. Thank you, my dear. Thank you for your confidence in me. We'll be having dinner soon, if you'd like, I can provide you with a change of costume from the trading post. Not an elaborate thing, but a dress at least. Thank you, I'd appreciate it. You satisfied, Mr. Kyle? Yeah, I guess so. And may I suggest, major, that you take your defeat gracefully and make our evening together as pleasant as possible. And as short. I've got a lot of traveling to do. There you are, sir. That's enough. And you, major? Why not. I see you're enjoying yourself. Is it possible you still hope for a miracle? Fort Jackson riding to your aid? Major Jeffers. Be quiet. If you like, you have permission to tell your friends the location of my troops. It's worth a thousand dollars to them, major. Payable at Fort Jackson, of course. I appreciate your surprise, my dear, but shots fired in the air rarely kill men on the ground. Then they were working for you. No. They were what I said they were, mercenaries. One of the unpleasant aspects of war, Miss Bronson, is that creatures such as you've just seen often follow on its wake like vultures on a battlefield. We detest them, yet we are forced at times to make use of them. I'm sure Major Jeffers feels as I do, as every military man does. What was that? Nothing, my dear. Nothing. Just Brock and Perry. There was a time when war was the property of gentlemen, of men on horseback who fought under a rigid, ethical code. Unfortunately my dear, those times have passed. Ah, bring them in. Come. Lieutenant Wylie, Captain Peters, welcome, gentlemen. What is it this time? Good news, a gold train. Munroe will give you the details. He has a map and full instructions. What's wrong, captain? The men are grumbling. Getting hard to handle. That's your problem, Peters, not mine. Either you can command a troop or you can't. You made them promises. I intend to keep them. They've got nothing so far. They say you're keeping the profits. And I say so too. It's gold now or no raid. Wylie, you're in charge now. Tell the men I've scouted the gold train, we have it outnumbered. They'll get their share of the gold tomorrow. Now, collect your orders from Munroe. Well, go on. Yes, sir. Come on. One moment. Betien. I'm sorry. I tried to tell you. You did what you had to. I'm thinking of the people who died helping him. Carson. And the men at the Golden Trail. So he gets a bullet in the back one of these days. Miss Bronson, Mr. Lamartine would like to speak to you for a moment. Miss Bronson, I have decided under the circumstances to send you on to the camp. I assure you, it's best for all concerned. What's going to happen to them? Nothing, my dear. Nothing. Oh, no. No. Wylie, I'll join you as soon as possible. Miss Bronson has asked me to convey her regrets and her appreciation for your efforts. She's spending the night at camp. And then? She's agreed to accompany us tomorrow after the attack. Will you, uh, join me in a final drink, gentlemen? Since there's been some doubt cast on our legitimacy as Southern soldiers, we greet the gold train tomorrow in full uniform. We ride to the attack, colors flying. Now if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I have some packing to do. Up. In there. Well, maybe I should've believed you. Been better for all of us. We might still have a chance. I've hidden a gun in the other room. Where'd you get it? Brock. But we gotta get out of here to use it. Are the horses ready? Yes, sir, they're all packed. Excellent. I'll go on with them and leave the rest to you. We meet you at the rendezvous with the Yankee gold. And then, on to the border. Think you and Betien can finish things here? It'll be a pleasure. Good. Oh, Munroe, might be advisable afterwards if the trading post were to catch fire. Yes, sir. Gil. Um-hm. If one of us gets out of here alive, that one's gotta go straight to the gold train. Well, let's get out of here first, huh? Where is the gold train? Two miles the other side of Medicine Valley. That's your quickest way to the girl. Maybe. Well, you can't ride into Ramada Canyon alone, the whole troop's there. Gil. You've gotta promise me. I'm the one that knows where the gun is. Right. Is this the gun you're looking for, major? Stay where you are, major. I said stay where you are. Get out the window. I'm staying with you. You promised. Go on. I'll cover. Halt. Where do you think you're going? I have a message for your commanding officer. Dismount. What is it? Says he has a message for you. From Major Jeffers. Major Jeffers? Come in. Loukai, load that in the wagon. Well, gentlemen, we're on the march at last. Wylie. Yes, sir? Order the men to commence breaking camp at once. Kelso. Have you checked the ammunition? We've got plenty. And the horses? Five extra mounts. Splendid. What about the uniforms? Uniforms? I told Munroe I wanted every man in this company in battle dress. Our last action must be a credit to the Confederacy. Yes, sir. I can't believe that you were ever a Confederate officer. Why not? You couldn't have sunk this low. A common bandit. I'm afraid you're not being realistic, my dear. The war is lost. The South could have no possible use now for our gold. So, what could be more logical than to use it ourselves? We plan to get through disguised as an ordinary wagon train. But if you're telling the truth, we'll need every reinforcement we can get. There's no point in me lying to you. You sent for us, sir? Yes. I want every man in the camp rousted out. Seems we're in for an attack tomorrow. Carr, have the outriders cover every ranch and farm. Anybody and everybody that can fire a rifle I want brought in before daybreak. Yes, sir. You take two men, Fenton, ride ahead to the trading post. I want a report on what happened there. Yes, sir. Now look, captain, I know Ramada Canyon like the back of my hand. You give me some of your men, I can get the girl out. And let Lamartine know he's been discovered? I'm sorry. We'll see what we can do after the attack. Miss Bronson. Company's monitor. Fine. Give the order to advance. Yes, sir. Miss Bronson, you will accompany me. Where you taking me? To a place near the point of the attack. Quite safe, I assure you. And afterwards? We'll discuss that later. They're moving in, all right. Yeah. I wanna see Lamartine's face when he finds out we got men in those wagons instead of gold. Yeah. Where's Lamartine? Come on, where is he? Fox Canyon, most likely. Where's the girl? She's in the wagon. Move. Give me a hand, Kelso. We gotta get out of here fast. I'm getting out of here now. Kelso! Round up all the prisoners in one place. Yes, sir. I see you found her. Yeah. I, uh, found something else too. Well, Colonel Lamartine. We've been wanting to meet you for a long time. Put him with the rest of the prisoners. Yes, sir. Sign a man to this wagon. We're starting everything out there that can move. Yes, sir. We'll be going through Golden Trail about dusk. I don't think anybody'll notice if you both drop off there. Maybe she can stay with the sheriff. Well, maybe I'll still be able to keep that date with a bottle of wine. And a good-looking redhead.
