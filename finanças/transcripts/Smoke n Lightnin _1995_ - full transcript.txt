[Mr. Carter] No, you don't because I have the only key because it's my briefcase and thank your lucky stars you didn't. [Mr. Carter] If you even think about opening that case, there won't be enough left of the three you to bury in a wallet. Now, do I have your attention? There are two very sensitive anti-tampering devices built into that briefcase. [Lightnin] Okay, I'm from Florida. I-- can you speak English, what does this mean? What it means is, that if you try to open it, it's self-destructs. Self-destruct? Yes, as in explodes. [Mr. Carter] And it also explodes if you tamper with the cuffs. What else is in this briefcase? You said there was two devices? Oh, yes. The second one I'm particularly proud of, I had something to do with inventing it. It's called a shock sensor. Now, all that means to you is, [Mr. Carter] if you bump it too hard, that red light on top will start blinking, now when that happens, you and your friends have six hours to connect with me and the key or you can start making reservations for breakfast with Elvis. Hey pal, ain't looking good for you. Now, please do not bump that case very hard, do you understand? Yeah, we understand. And what else do you want us to do? Cooperate. Just do exactly as I say.

It's for alligators, no big thing. [Melody] Holy shit! You are crazy. All right, I'll pay, you fill up the tank. Uh, I'm gonna go see if they heard anything and knew what's going on. What's up? Well, the good news is that there's no sign of bad guy. Well, what's the bad news? That the lady inside says-- has a police scanner and she says that we're out of property than Tom Cruise's underwear. Well, things can't get much worse, right? Yes, they can. There's the road where we're now. [car honking] ♪♪ Do it. Go, girl, go, girl, go, girl. [Lightnin] Yeeha! Come on. That was nice and western, babe. [shouting] Now, what are we gonna do?

[bomb ticking] Looks like he's not going anywhere. Lightnin, are you all right? [deep breathing] ♪♪ [engine running] [birds chirping] You red, right here, right now. [device beeping] Nice meeting you, goodbye. Goodbye. Say something to him. Uh, Mister, um... Don't say a word. What you guys did was wrong. As a matter of fact it was a federal crime. But if you hadn't taken this briefcase, it would've probably fallen into the wrong hands. So, instead of destroying your country, you probably ended up saving it. So, as far as I'm concerned, none of this ever happened. You never saw the car, you never saw the briefcase. And most importantly, you never heard of me. You got that? So, Mr. Carter, what is in the briefcase? Clipper chips.Clipper chips? They're brand new. They allow us to access any computer in the world and that's a lot of information any way you cut it. It helps us keep track of the bad guys. And you Lightnin, don't you forget, you owe me a big one.
