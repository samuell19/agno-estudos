You are right on time I want something for this great nephew of mine Master Lui , I'm here to resign I don't think I can help Mr. & Mrs. Lui I don't' think they can have a baby Since Andy Lau wants to have a second baby I'm going to help them Am I not paying you enough? It's okay, I know what to do! This diamond necklace should be enough to change your mind! Wow, so shiny! This necklace is worth 1 billion! Very reasonable, I'll take it! Thank you, Mr. Lui. If you would carry on to help me "The Star of Malaysia" is yours Why have you signed "Andy Lau"? I'm Andy Lau! A lot of people want me to be the Chief Executive But I have to say no I'm too busy It's time to take your medicine, Mr. Lui Yes, where were we? I said I want to quit Mr. & Mrs. Lui are not ready They are still child themselves Even if they have a baby, the baby won't be happy Gong, I don't have much time! Are you alright? I don't want to talk too much You can ask my doctor I'll give them a call and tell them to apologize! How's Master Lui? What he's got is Alzheimer's Is it terminal? Yes At least there's no medicine to cure it! So how long does he has? I have seen some people with this who live to be over a hundred years old You said it's terminal Well, there is no cure for it! So how long left until he's completely gone? I promise you in about a year! Then what happens? With Alzheimer's People will begin to forget things Then they'll remember them again Then forgets them again And wouldn't able to remember it ever again The more acute patients can have a change in personality and seems like a completely different person! Really? Damn! Who are you? What do you want? I'm Mrs. Lui Master Lui called me to come and apologize! Mrs. Lui , please sit! Take your time You would really do anything! Don't hit me! I'm sorry!

Please help us, daddy! Will she cry? I hate children crying! Baby won't cry at all knowing it's her grandpa taking care of her Really? Ha, yeah! That's not crying! She's talking to me What's the matter? Smile! Smile! Smile! Do I know you? Remember our pact for taking you out Don't cry or I'll leave you behind You find that funny? Look, a baby! You are so cute! Baby! Is the baby a boy or girl? Do you want a look? It's alright! The baby is yours? Do I look like I have a baby so young? She is my son's baby! Can't tell you are a grandpa at all! You're great! I'm alright! A shame that we have to get back to work if not we can go and have coffee with you I can go now But we said we couldn't Do you take the baby here everyday? If you girls are here I can come by everyday Don't lie to us! Why would I lie? Baby, we'll see you tomorrow! Bye bye, baby! Bye bye! Bye bye, baby! She said "Bye bye, baby" to me! You are so great! Remember, more hard work tomorrow Dress you up cuter This position would open up the pelvic cavity Give the baby more room to swim the mother tries to open up the shoulder breathe deeply and relax Ok, and again, slowly Still angry, are you? Don't be so uptight! I've forgiven you It's just I can't forget Let it go! So? I don't know! Smile suits you better! Why are you taking me to Alex's Yoga school?

It's so funny, I wetting like a baby! Then walk! Come here Be... be careful! That's the trouble with a big house! Are they still looking at us? Yes, yes! Damn, our bedroom is on the 4th floor! Gong, you don't need to keep staring give us a break, would you? Do you believe everything you hear? If I really can tell if a person is pregnant or not by looking why would we need ultrasound? Slowly! Take it easy! You two must be Mr. & Mrs. Lui? Dr. Yip is ready for the two of you to go in OK! Let me inform her! Thank you! I'll let you go in alone! I'll go with her!

DiDi, I can see you Bo, try putting the ultrasound on DiDi's tummy I'm still missing a picture here Alex, hold it off for a little longer Hold off longer? Why hold off longer? Our ultrasound machine is like a tube amplifier It needs to be warmed up before use, so we need to wait So low tech here? You're going to do it through her tummy? Is there another way? She's only two months in shouldn't you probe something inside that would be more clear, right? I don't think that's necessary No it's not necessary Doing it this way will just be as clear on our machine Yes! Mrs. Lui , I'm going to locate the area first It's plugged in wrong! Do it all over again! Dr. Yip, isn't it ready yet? How long does it take for the machine to warm up?
