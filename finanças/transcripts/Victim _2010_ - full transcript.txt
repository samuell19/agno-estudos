Man, Hi. So, have you ever done this before? No. No? No. So come on in and sit on the bed for me. Thanks. Where, where'd you say you're from, again? Kansas. Kansas. Yeah, that's right. No place like home? Click your heels twice? Would you do something for me? Mm-hmm. So I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna put my hand on top of your head and, and just help you get relaxed. O.K. Could you tell me about that butterfly? I just got it when I was home. You got it when you were at home... Wow. It's beautiful. You're beautiful. I'm just helping you get relaxed. O.K. Now, now just close your eyes for me... And just think of something... Something really nice and I'm gonna go into the bathroom now. But just keep them closed for me, O.K.? O.K. O.K.... I'll be right back. Keep them closed. You stupid bitch! Come on, come on! You like it! No... Please. Woman: Get you a refill? I got time for another... And maybe your number. I don't give my number. Oh, here. You can take my card. Gimme a call. Who are you? What do you want? What? Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Get the fuck away from me! Stop it! Stop! Oh, god! What is it? What are you doing?! What is it...?! Let us start clean. A blank slate, as they say. Haven't you ever wanted to start over? Man, recorded: Be careful when putting on new attire. A lady's shoulders are narrow and their hips are wide, so always slip a dress on over the head. Pull gently, careful not to stretch the fabric. If you are wearing a full slip, then be sure to tighten it at the seam... Hey! I need water! I need water! Hello! I need something to drink! The girl follows the headwaiter or hostess and the boy follows her... Table and seating his lady fair... Help! Anybody! Let me out! Older man: You're wasting your energy. Help! No one can hear you. Fuck you. You're regaining your strength... that's good. You're going to need it. Fuck... You. Older man: I expect the utmost cooperation from you in the time we're going to spend together. Do you understand? Man: What do you want from me? What is your name? What do you remember last? I was having a drink. Look, I don't know, it's all hazy. Let me the fuck out of here. You have a foul mouth. In fact, everything about you is foul. Your stench pollutes this entire space. No, man... I'll return in a few hours and see if your attitude has improved. Little girl: Dear diary, I found a special place to write. It's cold, damp, and the darkness scares me, but no one can find me down here. I'm all alone. Father says it's better this way. That's why he won't let me go to school like other children. He says people might want to take me away from him. Man, recorded: Prestige behavior is key. A true lady is modest, discreet, kind and obliging. If you... Older man: Did you know that there are seven different types of fingerprints that humans possess? They simply vary in shapes and sizes, yet they are so... Identifiable. Now... Mister George. This would be the type of pain which you cannot control. You may think of it as unnecessary, but if we're to continue our work together, it's quite essential. You are no longer you. Do you understand? Little girl: Dear diary, finally today the most amazing thing happened to me. Father gave me a present. It's a beautiful red dress. He says mom used to wear it for him. I know it's big. But one day, diary, I think I want to wear it too. Older man: Georgie, remember, lock the cellar door. It's very important. I don't want to have to keep reminding you... Oh! Woman: You've reached 9-1-1 emergency. I need someone's help now, right... Please wait for the next available operator. Emergency, may I help you? Hello? Help me. I don't know where I am, I'm in a mansion somewhere. Hello? Man: No, no, no, no... Mister George. Please! You can't keep me in here! People will be looking for me! No need to worry. Little girl: Dear diary. It was the most perfect day today. Father and uncle George took me to the park and we saw so many wonderful things. Man, recorded: A lady is always fluid and graceful in her posture. Keep your shoulders back and walk with one foot directly in front of the other. Good posture is key. Let this be a guide for good daughters and mothers who have poise and... Little girl: Uncle George watched me play in the grass. I don't like when he looks at me that way. I told him to stop, but father says he likes to stare at beautiful things. When I grow up, will I be beautiful, diary? Janet, it's Carl. How are you? Haven't heard back from you on that report I sent over. Oh, uh, wanted to say I hear you're heading down to Florida to take care of your mother. Good luck. Anyway, call me about that report. Records, please. Carl... This is Janet. So what's this report you left me? Wasn't a uniform sent? Uh-huh, I got it. Rich folks and their gates. Winthrop court... Right. Bye, Carl. Winthrop court... Records. Run me a report on that Winthrop address. The food looks wonderful, Georgia. We have much work to do. Save the bones for our guest, Georgia. What? Man, recorded: And be sure to tighten it at the seaMs. You really should have come down for dinner. Get some rest. Older man: We are accepting no visitors. Please go away. Hello. I'm Detective Janet Corwin with the Lake Zurich P.D. I'm here to ask you a few questions about a 9-1-1 call that was made from this address. It should only take a few minutes. Little girl: Please. I'm in awe of the kindness, love and generosity that one person can show another. Unfortunately, my young nephew has played pranks like this in the past. I assure you that the boy was punished. Oh... well, may I speak with the boy, please? I'm afraid not. He left with his father for New York this morning. Oh. Do you have children of your own, Dr. Volk? Yes... my daughter, Rachel. She's living in Los Angeles, trying to become an actress, of all things. Oh. Do you see her often? She comes and stays with me every now and again. Hmm, well, she's very pretty. Anything else, Detective? No, no. I suppose that's all. Uh, thank you for your time. Of course. Carl, it's me. Can you get me the report on the Winthrop address by Monday? Remember our work. Put him in the chair. That was the stupidest thing you have done so far. Now you will pay for it. Now you'll pay for it. What do you want? [distorted voices [overlapping...] Give me a call. Give me a call. Give me a call. Do you like music? Yes. Good. What's your name? Do you like music? Yes. Good. What's your name? I don't know. Where are you from? I don't know. Are you married? No. No, or you don't know? N-n-no... Or I don't remember. Try. Why do you keep asking me the same questions? I told you, I don't remember. Tell me... Do you recognize...? Nevertheless, we are making progress. Let us leave him, mister George. Wait... Who's the girl? Mister George. Make sure you give him some therapy. How are you feeling today? Not so good. We're going to clean you up. You've been receiving a mixture of hormones, antidepressants and vitamins for some time now. This will make you feel better. Mister George is going to shave you. If you move, he'll slit your throat. Understand? Yes. Good. Two years ago. You son of a bitch. "first officer on the scene was officer Brian McHammond." Shit... Get me the L.A.P.D. I'm innocent! Good afternoon. Please. I... I can't stop crying. I have something for you to wear. What's that? Put it on. Why? Take your old clothes off. Volk: You need to put on the dress. I don't want to. You'll not be fed until you put on your new clothes. I'm not gonna wear a fucking dress! Things are progressing well. We're on schedule. You need your strength. Are you happy now? I'm wearing the fucking dress! What are you looking at, asshole? Do you talk? Huh? Why are you looking at me like that? Stop it. Stop looking at me like that! Stop it! I don't like you looking at me like that! I don't like you seeing me this way! Stop it! Volk: Stand up. You have too much body hair. It must be removed. For your nails. Your favorite color is blue. Do it or no dinner tonight. Can I at least have some privacy? Come closer. What do you think? Man: No more... Please. Shh... It's all for the best. Please... Let me free us both from sin. Shh... No, mister George. We need that to form the vagina. No...! Here. Take it. I'm not here to hurt you. I know you don't understand what we're accomplishing here. But you will. I promise. "There be none of beauty's daughters with a magic like thee. And like music on the waters is thy sweet voice to me. When..." Oh... I've worn you out. I do get carried away. I know it's your favorite. Rest well, dear... Rest. Georgie, could you help her back to bed, please? Shit. Please, don't transfer me. I'm, I'm looking for officer McHammond. I need to talk to him about a case he was first officer on. Does anyone know where he is? Great, Cabo San Lucas. Um... Can someone relay a message to him? Have him call Detective Janet Corwin of Lake Zurich P.D. He's feverish. It's too damp in here. Put him in the guest bedroom for now. Yes. I'm sure. Corwin. Detective Corwin? Yes. Hey, this is Brian McHammond. I got a message you're trying to reach me? Yes I, I wanted to talk to you about Rachel Volk. Sound familiar? Yeah. Yeah. That does sound familiar. You knew her before the murder? Yeah. I knew her. Uh, I knew her by the name of Rachel Gavin, that was her stage name. Did you lock the guest bedroom like I asked? Good. Then you may finish your gardening. Detective Corwin, I'm sorry. I'm extremely busy today. I have no time for visitors. Well, I'm in a rush and I only need five minutes of your time. I have some very important work to do. I can always come back tomorrow with a few more officers and a warrant. Have it your own way. Volk: What is this about? This is starting to feel like harassment. I do apologize. I, uh, I hoped you'd clear something up for me about the other day. You mentioned that your brother was here visiting and his son dialed 9-1-1 as a prank? And that your daughter, Rachel, is living in Los Angeles, trying to become an actress. That's correct. What kind of acting is she doing? You know what I hate about my job, Dr. Volk? I'm sure I don't know. Everyone lies to you. Was your daughter involved in anything unusual before she was killed? I'm going to have to ask you to leave. What are you hiding? You're a police officer, Ms. Corwin. You have seen many horrible things in the line of duty, have you not? Have you ever lost someone you loved? Have you ever had them taken from you? Have you ever wondered what you are capable of? If you had the power to change things, would you? Back off. I said back off. Who else is in this house? Who was that? Who else is in this house? No one. I mean it! I assure you, we are alone. Move it. Move! Move it... Open the door. I don't have the keys. I said open it! This is a mistake. Open the door and then back away. Back away. Back away. What have you done? I'm here to help you. Detective Corwin, you don't understand. I understand perfectly. I'm taking this person with me. Please don't. Man: Who are you? Where's my diary? He's sick. He can't be moved. Oh, Rachel! Rachel... Rachel? You, you are so screwed, you sick son of a bitch. Why? Because I love my daughter? Carl, pick up, damn it. Pick up. I am so sorry, Detective Corwin. } Volk: The phone! Georgie... Detective Corwin... You should have listened to your fears. It's nice to see you like this. Little girl: Dear diary, I had such a wonderful day today. My father took me to the garden. He loves his garden so much. He had to dig a hole to plant our seeds. Volk: More will come, you know. It doesn't matter, Georgia. His mind has finally opened up to us... we start phase two as scheduled. Little girl: I wasn't supposed to tell anyone where we hid the seeds. But my father told me that in the right season, something beautiful will grow there. This should... Buy us the time we need. Once we're finished, let them come. Be sure the car's never found. Man, tearfully: "it was a small gesture, but I'm in awe... Of the kindness... Love... And generosity... That one person... Can show another." It's time. Please... "i know it was a small gesture, but I'm in awe... Of the kindness... Love... And generosity..." As well you should be. The incisions will be made here and here. Please. No more. Please. The diary. What about the diary? It's taught me so much. There really is... Kindness in the world... Innocence... Isn't there? This is necessary pain. Mister George. Woman: ♪ Ave... Maria... ♪ "knowing is not enough. You must apply. Willing is not enough. You must do." Goethe. Congratulations, Georgia. Your time will soon come. He must be hot again. I was concerned about this. He's not reacting well to the surgery. We need to cool you down. You have an infection. Keep him in the water for 10 minutes, then check his temperature again. Then put him back in the guest bedroom. Aah... He's fine. Let him rest, check on him in an hour. And Georgia... The hair. May I help you? Sorry to bother you, but we're searching for a missing officer... Janet Corwin. We understand she came to visit you. Corwin. Yes. The lady detective. There was some sort of glitch in the emergency telephone system. That was quite some time ago. Right. Some people thought she might have gone to Florida, only she's not there. And no one can find her. Well, I know nothing about that. Think you might know where she is, or... Did she say anything to you? No. She said nothing. Okay, then. Thank you for your time. Rachel? It's time for dinner. High-pitched voice: Yes, father. We've achieved so much. It's time to appreciate it while we can. Oh, we've been waiting for you. High-pitched voice throughout: I'm sorry, father. I had to prepare the roast. And it looks absolutely delicious, don't you agree? I do. Here. Won't you do the honors? Go on. You're so much more meticulous than i. Mister George. Thank you. A... A poem then. "the hand of vengeance found the bed to which the purple tyrant fled. The iron hand crushed the tyrant's head and became a tyrant in his steaD." William Blake. It's so good to have you with us, Rachel. It's been too long. "Rachel": I'm sorry to disturb you. Oh, no. Please come in. You're not disturbing me. Would you do something for me, Rachel? Anything. Would you dance for me... Like you used to? But there's no music. Let's see what we can do about that. You are so beautiful. Father... Father! Rachel... You left me once... Without saying good-bye. Now... Go upstairs and put on your blue sundress. I've been preparing a surprise for you. A surprise? Yes... a special surprise. It's taken me a long time but it's finally ready. Are you ready? What is it? You'll find out... Very soon. When? Tonight, Rachel... Tonight. Is it time? Yes... It's time. Follow me. What is it? Your surprise. Rachel on video: Kansas. Man, distorted: Kansas? Yeah, that's right. Is everything in place? It must duplicate the real thing, precisely... does it? Good. Man: Come on in. Have you ever done this before? Rachel: No. That's O.K., come on, come on in. O.K.... Sit down, please. Would you do a favor for me? Sure. Would you just... Would you brush your hair back just a little bit? What's going on? Man: What is that? Uh, it's a butterfly. Butterfly. What are you doing? Man: O.K., I want you to lay back for me. Such beautiful legs. They're so beautiful. [video continues [indistinctly...] What are you doing? Stop it. What are you doing? I said stop. Man: Take off your dress. Take off your dress. Take off your dress. I... Why are you doing that? Why are you doing that? Stop it... I said stop. Man: I want to see what's going on under here, I want to feel you, I want to touch you. Stop it! Rachel: No! Man: Take it off! Take it off! You stupid bitch! Come on! Fucking bed and you're gonna fuck me! Man: Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! [Rachel screaming and crying, ["Rachel" crying...] Man: You like that, don't you?! You fuckin' like that! Father? Father! Get up! I said get up! Put your hands behind your head, clasp your fingers together. Walk. Where are we going? You say one more word, I'll blow your brains out right here. Man: Take it off... Volk: Stop right there. Man: Touch you. Yes, yes! Rachel: No! Take it off! You take this off! It's a web service where men pay to have their fantasies acted out. Rape videos... Snuff filMs... Get in there. Man: Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Get on your knees. Face the screen. Man: You like it! Volk, crying: You only wanted to be an actress. I'm sorry. Sorry? You want to know why I let you read my baby's diary? Because I wanted you to feel exactly what she felt. Oh... I've done terrible things. But I had to give you back your innocence so you would know exactly what it felt like to have it ripped out of you! Please... Please, father. I'll do anything. You want to know a little secret? She... Lived. She survived. And even though her doctors said her brain was dead, I brought her here. I nursed her back to health. For what? She can't leave her room. She can't even have dinner with her own father. Please... Please! No... No. N-no! No... Rachel... Rachel, I'm not gonna hurt you! Let me in! Rachel? Rachel? Rachel... Rachel... Little girl: I've decided that some day I want to become a movie star. I'll do whatever it takes. But I'm afraid, diary. I'm scared. My father says the world can be a very bad place. My father says I could get hurt if I go too far away. He says I shouldn't trust people. Is it true, diary? Will people want to hurt me? Is my father right? Are people mostly bad on the inside? I don't think so. I think people are good on the inside. I think they can be trusted. I think on the outside, people are like caterpillars. But on the inside, like butterflies... Waiting to come out.
