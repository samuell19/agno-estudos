KEEP GOING Sybille! Sybille! Mom! Mom! You have to get the biggest ones. That rock's too small. This one's good. There we go. Let's try again! Come on, let's go. One, two... Push! Careful. Watch the horses. Yeah! I'm here during the tourist season, but Mairambek lives here year-round. We organize tours. Otherwise we live in Bilbao. -You know it? -Yes. -Your horses are very beautiful. -Thank you. Samuel picked them out. What? The horses. I don't see many wanderers. My father also organized equestrian tours. If you want, you can stay with us tonight. Actually, we're supposed to get through the pass tonight. We're going to Osh... We can leave early tomorrow. -No, that won't work. -Yes it will. Then we won't be there. We said that. On the road again. Here we go. Can we go? Go! Hey! Easy. Shit! Come on. You OK? Take it. The hobble? Where is it? There. Come here. Come here. Wait. Give me some light. That's good. Hello, welcome. Thanks for having us. The French are here! Hello. -How was your trip? -Good. This is my son, Samuel. -You horses are beautiful. -Thanks. He says the horses are beautiful. Hello. It's OK, I'll take them. -It's OK, he's used to it. -No, I don't need help. I'll show you where the round pen is. It's just here. Come to the house. Did you get our list? Yes. We got almost everything. Are you OK by yourself? Huh? Are you doing OK? Hello. Hello. My children... I'll show you your room. Come in. Here you go. It's here. Food. Good. This is what we bought. Enough for 10 days. We'll divide it among your horses. Great. Have you been warned that the crossing isn't secure? No, no one told me anything. It'll be all right. -Call us if there's a problem. -OK. And if you want to stay longer... That's nice, but this will be fine. If you need anything at all... Samuel, do you want oats? No, thanks. Are you going to wash? Do you want to wash up? I'll wait for a shower. Tea? Thank you. Thank you. Go ahead. That's all right. Hamid can be that way, too. Yeah. Do your children go to school here? For now. Alima likes school, but Elina prefers horses. Same with Samuel. Is he angry? All the time... Mostly at me. Drink your tea. I'm going to cook. No, thanks. Sybille, you should go to Chaikhana and try the samsa from Osh. And the Osh pilaf, too, with Uzgen rice. I can't make it as well. I recommend going to the racetrack to see our national sport, Ulak Tartysh. My father mentioned that to me. Is your father from here? From Moscow. You talking about me? No, not about you. Does Samuel speak Russian? No. But you've lived here? No, I grew up in France. But we spoke Russian at home. -What are you talking about? -Your grandfather. Maybe you should tell them how you sold your house for this trip? It was mostly to pay off debt. His grandfather taught him about horses. I said your grandfather taught you to ride. What the fuck do these half-wits care? Sam, stop it! Stop. They can't understand me. They've never left their country. Shall I tell them why you left yours? Do you want me to? Fuck you. Fuck you and your stupid trip. What did you just say? -Fuck you. -Stop it, Sam! I'm sorry. I just apologized. Now apologize for what you said. Sam, apologize, please. Apologize for what you said to me. It's not that hard. He didn't want to come. I can't take this, Sam. You don't speak for days, and when you do it's to insult me. I'd rather you not speak. -It's better when I shut up? -Yes. I don't understand what's going on. What are you going to do? I'm not the one with problems. I didn't beat up my teacher. I'm not the one risking prison. Do you get that? I'm not the one screwing up my life. You already did. We're talking about you. Wake up, Samuel. Why are you like this? -Why am I like this? -Yes. Tell me. Why are you so angry at me and everyone else? Because I don't give a fuck. I don't give a single fuck. Stop it. You're acting like an idiot. I don't care. Would you rather have stayed with your father? At least he offered something. What do you offer? These dipshits -who don't even know-- -Stop it! Are you that stupid? How come all that comes out of your mouth is trash? What did you say? What did you say? Stop it! Shut up! Get the fuck off! How are you? Everything's fine. -Here. -Thank you. This is for you. It might help you. Be careful. Thanks. I hope we'll see you again. Me too. Good luck! -What is it? -A present. Show me. What a comforting gift. Give it to me. I'll keep it. You don't even know how to use it. Let's go. -Fix the reins. -I'm fed up. Fix your reins; they're all messed up. Of course you're fed up. The horse doesn't understand. -Fix your reins. -OK. The right one is way too long compared to the left one. How's that? Now lower your heels, and turn your toes in. You look like a cowboy. OK. Hold it tight. OK. Be careful, please. That's not funny, Sam. You think that's funny? Put it down! Give me the gun. Keep your stupid fucking gun. She's crazy. She's wacko. Sam? Sam? Sam! Sam! Sam! Show me. Here. Oh, is that how it is? Come on, give it. I must get it from you. Dad says you're an alcoholic. Well, if Dad says so. And what do you think? I don't know. Hey, Nador. You got it covered? Yeah. In Russian, please? -You British? French? -French. Have you been here long? What are you doing here? -Going to Osh. -There's nothing here. -Who's that? -My son. -What do they want? -I don't know. -Tell them to fuck off. -Don't start. Get your stuff and we'll just go. What's your name? How old are you? -Where's your husband? -He's on his way back. He left you alone? That's not good. Beautiful horses. Can I take one for a ride? How much for your horses? They're not for sale. So can you give them to us? Why won't you talk? You don't want to chat? Leave us alone. We have to go. Clear off! Break it up! Clear off! Get out of here. Hurry up. Come on, let's go. Are you kidding? What do you want to do? What do I want to do? Take out your phone and call... I don't know, someone! We're not bugging anyone. Call! Call! We're going to die out here. We're not going to die. You were brave, and they left. Get your stuff and let's go. Fucking call someone! You're messed up. Jesus Christ. Come on. Let's go home. Sam. Come on, hurry up. I didn't ask for this. Why are you doing this? To punish me? Is that what this is about? No. No one's punishing anyone. I wanted to be there for you, for once. I thought we could reconnect. Well, we did. I'm going to be honest, Mom. What haven't you messed up? You. -Huh? -You. Me, what? Have you seen me? Where were you all those years? When I was screwing up? Why was it Dad taking care of me? Why? It was a long time ago. His name was Gael. I was in love. He died. I wanted to be dead, too. I met your father and I got pregnant right away. I was young, Sam. Very young. I was your age. I thought it would save me. But... So I left. Well, I'm here. Hey. Hey. Mom. Mom. Come on, give it. No, Sam. Next time I'll kill you. Wait. Oh, shit. -God damn it. -What? -What's wrong? -Fuck. I lost my iPod. Shit. Fucking motherfucker. No fucking way. What are you doing?! I'm looking. We're not going to find it. I lost it, that's it! Mom. God damn it. Fuck this. Come on. You hear me? Fuck this. Sam. -What? -I found it. -Thanks. -No problem. Sorry. You OK? You got it? -Grandma. -Shut up. OK. "Dear darling diary, "it's beautiful here. "Everything's good, although my butt hurts a bit. "My horse was very nice. "Thank God Sam's here. I don't know what I'd do without him. "I'm a little lost out here, but it's OK. "There, darling diary, "I love you madly." Not bad, huh? Tell me what you're writing. Stuff. Stuff? Stuff. It's none of your business. Did you ever do that before? I'm doing it now. What's the point? What's the point? Are you making something up? Or just writing? Do I ask you what you listen to on your iPod? That's totally unrelated. You can ask me, if you want to listen. What's your favorite song? That's a bit tricky. Sorry, but... I can't sleep in there. No way. You hear me? There's no way. It's probably still in there. It was just a little lizard. Are you kidding? It's a snake. Are there none in here? Just me. Can I come sleep in there? Sure, come on. What? Nothing. Go! Come on. Come on. Come on. He's sinking! He's sinking! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Go! Come on! Go! Come on! Come on. Come on. Good. Good. Come take a shower! Not with our stuff. We can dry it in the sun. Come on! No. The water's nice. -Come on. -No. -No? -No. Stop it! It's too cold. -You're crazy. -Come on. Come on, please! Oh, no. Sam? Hey. Hey. Don't worry sweetheart That's life, don't cry You'll forget, sweetheart Don't cry. I'll take you to dry your tears Through the winds of north south east and west Smell the violets in Parma And the spices in Colombo We'll see the Amazon and the valley of orchids, And the children washing their bellies With crushed flowers Don't worry sweetheart That's life, don't cry You'll forget, sweetheart Don't cry Let's see the land of Abraham It's even more beautiful than they say There are Van Goghs in Amsterdam That look like raging fires And... And... Hang on. That look like raging fires We'll eat raw herrings And drink the wine of Mosel I'll tell what a hit I was when I was in Sganarelle Don't worry, sweetheart That's life, don't cry You'll forget, sweetheart Don't cry Hello. I don't think we're going to find a farrier here. Hello. Blacksmith? Hello. Hello. Where are you from? France. -France? -Yes. -What do you want? -Is there a blacksmith? A blacksmith? Follow me. -He's the farrier? -I don't know. Can you help these French folks? Their horses need to be shoed. Hello. Hello. -You're a blacksmith? -Yes. We'll take care of it. We'll start with this one. Come this way. -Mom. -Come on. Easy. Why are they lying him down? Easy! You're hurting his hooves. You're hurting his hooves. Tell the kid to get out of here. Don't tie him so tightly. Let him go. Let him go. Move away. Can you translate? You need to calm down. They're not going to hurt them. Horses are sacred for them. They know words for horses that only they know. Secret words. You need to calm down and trust them and let them do what they do and not get in their way. If you want to stay, you can stay, but just watch. -Are we good? -Yes. Thank you. Yeah. Hey! Don't forget: "Today, Wednesday, "Samuel pulled off a crazy stunt." Do it again. No, you had to be watching. Yep. Yeah. So? -Not bad? -Not bad at all. Isn't this nice? Your father did his best, you know. What was Gael like? Handsome? Yeah. Hey! -Hey! -Oh, Juan! How are you? -You made it? -Yeah. -We just got here. -That's great. Come on. It's over there. Samuel. Not bad. Yeah. Here. Yeah. We don't give a good goddamn We don't give a good goddamn Even if we're scared Of the wolf and the owl We've got stuff to do Even if we're poor Cut the weeds of oblivion And then we celebrate! BakÃ©, let your daughter dance. One more time, Sybille! One, two, three! Translate. You'll see, in five minutes! Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam, put it down! Sam, no. Put it down. Sam! Sam! Whore! Fucking whore! -I have to go. -Let him. No, I'm sorry, I have to go. Let me go. Sam! Oh, Sam. Mom? Are you OK? Something hurts, but I'm OK. The horse? Mom? I can walk. Let me. Day 7. You're not speaking. Nor am I. Being with you here is like having a wound you never stop tearing open. You're so gentle with the horses. I'll never tell you, but I hurt everywhere, so badly. Something's going to happen, I know. I left you for too long. You're screaming, and so am I. We're fighting. That's something. You don't want anything. Other than to treat me like shit. We're traveling. That's all I have left. I sold everything for you. Your grandfather's house wasn't an inheritance. It was a prison. I want to free you from us. From myself. Hopefully you understand. Day 11. I finally told you about Gael. You're the first man I've talked to about him. Your father and grandfather know nothing. Your father... Don't blame him too much. I never gave him a chance. I wanted you to be Gael's son. I see your anger, your fear. Give them up. Ride toward others, because if you don't, it can kill you. For me, Gael is finally dead. We have to keep going, keep going toward the other. Subtitling: Hiventy
