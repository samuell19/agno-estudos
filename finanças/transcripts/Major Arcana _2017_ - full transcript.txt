There you are, have a great day. - You look retarded. - Huh? - What are you doing? - Grabbing a bite. You knew I'd be here. You back dating Craig again? More or less. What're you really doing here? - Eating, I told you. - No, in town. Settling my father's estate. What's that take, like 10 minutes? More or less. No, actually, he left me everything. Yeah? How much? Fifty-two acres and like, fifteen thousand bucks. Don't tell anybody. Enjoy your burger. I'm like, "You're a fucking idiot if you think that's the best show on TV." That one girl's a badass though, she's like pretty cool... So I guess I'll see ya. - Come over here. - What's up? - Oh, shit! - Fuck. See ya around. Oh my god, who was that guy? He took me to prom like a thousand years ago. - Seriously? - He's a dick. Ah, fuck. That Dad's car? He wasn't using it. I figured you'd show up, eventually. It's only been a couple days. I thought I'd tidy up the place a bit. You don't need to do that. I'm not even staying in here. I know, I saw your tent. Then why bother? Why bother? God damn it! Where have you been? Up in Canada. Canada's a big country. B.C. Doing what? Carpentry mostly. For four years? Time got away from me. Why didn't you call me? What if I needed you? I don't know. I figured you'd be okay. Sorry about your dad. No you're not. - Where are you going? - Just blowing off steam. I'll come see you in a couple days. Oh. Oh! Ah! Ahh! Ah! Dink? About hitting you, I didn't remember it. Molly said something this morning. I was drunk, you know how I get. - Bullshit. - Really. I was surprised to see you is all. - After the funeral... - You went to the funeral? There was a keg, I was bored. - How many people were there? - Couple dozen. For being such an asshole, your dad had a lot of friends. Yeah, well... Where you been? Nowhere, all over. Out west for a while, California, Oregon. - Doing what? - Odd and ends. Seeing the country mostly. Okay. So we're still friends? Yeah, of course. Cool. Well, you look good. You lost weight. Thanks. - Here you go. - Thank you. Mom, open up! - What is the matter with you? - You didn't answer the door! Here, get yourself shit-faced. You want some? No. I thought you'd call first. I don't have a phone. Well... I'm glad you're here. Yeah, me too. No, I mean the shower is all clogged up. I had to wash my hair in the sink. The pizza man delivers now. You staying for dinner? I don't think so, not tonight. You got plans? Yeah, got some friends I'm meeting. You're a liar. I'm not, I have plans. You do not. You're all alone. - I have a friend I'm meeting. - Like hell you do. I don't wanna sit around and listen to your bullshit. I was trying to be polite. Look, four months ago, your dad told me that he would buy me a ticket to Florida. Can you believe that? That would've been the nicest thing he ever did for me. I should've got it out of him when I had the chance. How much did he leave you? Fifty-two acres. Don't make me call you a liar again. - I'm telling the truth. - Bullshit! I know he had money stashed away. - He was gonna pay for my trip! - Two thousand bucks, but it's for the taxes. You think I'm stupid, don't you? Don't you? I know that he won $4,500 at the Indian casino in January. He must've spent it. On what? Even he couldn't drink that fast. That's my money. I've known him a lot longer than you did. He left it to me. I don't have anything! I'm not giving you the money. You know what? You're just like him. Selfish, a liar, and a deadbeat. You didn't fix the clog! Call a plumber. I can't afford a plumber! Asshole! I'm sorry about your dad. Oh, thank you very much. You guys are really kind. I drove during the blue hour from Pennsylvania to Vermont. Um, what is the blue hour? Time between like, morning... yeah, when it's dark to like light or early morning. - So everything looks blue. - Right, right. They're beautiful. - What's that, I'm sorry? - Take care of yourself. What the fuck? Get your fucking hands off me! - Fuck! - Hey! - Are you all right? - Fucking kidding me? Fuck! Shit. That was pretty messed up. He's a dick. - You want one? - No, thanks. Actually, I quit drinking. - What? - Yeah. You're like a sober person now? Yeah. - For how long? - Little while. Why's that funny? Your dad's rolling in his fucking grave. What you been up to? Shit. - Where to begin? - Yeah? No, not really. I had an au pair gig for a couple summers. This family from New York came up, I watched their kids. - Sounds pretty cool. - Yeah. I made enough money to go skiing and spend the winter getting hammered. What were the kids like? Cool. So what happened? Nothing, the parents sent 'em to sleepaway camp. It's fine, I had to get up really early, it was exhausting. I bet, kids can be pretty exhausting... I've been reading tarot cards though, lately. Like, as a thing I do on the side. - Yeah? - Yeah, you think that's weird? No, not at all, I think it's cool. It is, I mean, I don't know if you believe in that kind of thing or whatever, but I think it's kinda fascinating. This lady did readings at my cousin's bridal shower last year and I pulled the Wheel of Fortune, which is like a turning point. She was explaining it to me and I was like, "I could do this," so I got a deck of cards and started doing readings at the store. That's great. You gotta do mine sometime. Yeah? Sure. Cool. What was all that with you and Craig before? You don't have to tell me. You taste like beer. You taste like onions. Sorry. I, uh... Take me back to your place. I wanna see the inside of your tent. Um, okay. - You sure about this? - Totally. Actually, it's been a long time for me. How long? - Two years almost. - Seriously? This could be a big night for you. Take off your shirt. You take off your shirt. Take your pants off. Here. Lick it. Do it. What? Nothing. Take these off. Take these off. Sierra. Sierra? Motherfucker. Hey. You building a fort? More or less. What is all this? Nothing, just fucking around. So, last night... Yeah. - Yeah what? - Nothing. - You were just all fucked up. - I know. Look, this is kind of awkward for me, but can we just forget about it? Okay. You know what I mean though, right? Who am I gonna tell? I doubt you're gonna get a signal out here. I should probably get back to civilization. You gonna call Craig or something? Maybe. He's a tool, you know. You wanna get some pizza some night? I'll think about it. Hey, can I speak to Sierra, please? Tell her it's Dink. Tell her I'm really sick and I'd appreciate it if she could stop by after work for a few minutes. No, food poisoning, I think. Yeah, you did? No, just puking. Yeah, I don't feel so lucky. Dink, you got that? Thanks. Dink. - How's it going, Craig? - Pretty good. - Do you need any help? - No, I'm just gonna find some windows. So what's going on? You working a job or...? Sort of. Just helping out a friend. Well... holler if you need anything. What's the story with this? Nothing. Just got that in the other day. It's pretty nice. I guess. Some guy in Ludlow had it in his barn for, like, 60 years. How much? - This ain't for you. - Yeah? Why not? It's for some fucker from Boston who wants a centerpiece in his vacation home. It's worth more than your truck. That's okay. What's okay? Yeah, I don't care. I like it. I want it. Pull around front, I'll have one of my guys load you up. - How's Sierra? - Who the fuck knows? I'll tell you what, this can go either way. I'm gonna put it all out there, double or nothing. I got you on this one, motherfucker. Wacko. And two. It's all going down. Fuck yeah. Twenty bucks at a time. I'm gonna take your money. I know, I'm under pressure. I got this. One. Two. The last one's for you. Sorry, I didn't mean anything by that. - Help ya? - Hey, I'm here about the wood stove. Is it still for sale? Maybe. - Works okay? - What's not to work? I'll give you 200 bucks for it. - Mm-mm. - 250. - How much do you want? - Six hundred. The flyer says, "five or best offer." My wife put that ad. I'll give you 400 if you help me get it back to my house. - Been out this way before? - Yeah. Thanks for the help. You must think a lot about getting old, dying. I think about it all the time. Maybe it's 'cause, I don't know, when I get to be as old as you, I can't even imagine. Jesus, right? My wife died. Last month. Shit. I'm sorry. Damn. Oh. Fuck! Number 117, please. Thank you. ♪ Little darlin', I don't know where you came from ♪ ♪ But I've been lookin' for you all my life ♪ ♪ If everything is right, I just might tonight ask you if you want to be my wife ♪♪ Ah, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! God damn it! Fuck! Fuck. Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. What the hell have you been doing to yourself? Do you think it's broken? Can you move it? - You're fine. - Hurts like hell. Called you a couple weeks ago. I was super sick. Yeah, well, I see you got better. I thought we were gonna go for pizza some night. - Why would you think that? - 'Cause I asked you. - And I said "no." - You said you'd think about it. So? - It's not a good idea. - Because of Craig? - Because of a lot of things. - Come on, it's just pizza. It's never just pizza. How about my reading? - We're pretty busy. - I'll schedule an appointment. - Fine. When? - How about right now? Come on, just give me a break, okay? Yeah, sure. Keep it iced for a couple hours, it should be fine. - Thanks for the help. - Don't mention it. You know, I'd started to forget what a prick you are. Sorry, really. I just want to know what my future holds. - It's not fortune telling. - Fine. Sorry. Here. - Humor me. - Fifty bucks. - What? - Fifty bucks. You made me come out here after you, that's what it costs. Or can't you afford it? - I can afford it. - I thought maybe you'd burned through your inheritance already. Me? Sit. - Shuffle the cards. - Who's watching the store? I left a note saying I'd be back in 15 minutes. No, motherfucker, shuffle the cards. Close your eyes. Feel the weight of them in your hands. It doesn't mean anything if you don't take it seriously. I want you to think of a question. - What kind of question? - The question, what you want the cards to tell you. I got one. It's about this girl I know. Cut the deck. Pull three cards, lay 'em face down in front of you. The first card represents the energy you bring - into the reading. - Shit. Fucker looks like he's building a cabin. Is that what you're doing up here? Yeah. What for? To live in. It's the Ten of Wands. It represents a spiritual burden. - What kind of spiritual burden? - That's for you to say. Do you have a history of running people out, people close to you, sins you need to atone for? - Maybe, some. - See? The cards can be very profound. Next one reflects the present. - It's not what you think. - What does it mean? It's a challenge to surrender to Fate. Come on. You sure you know how to read these things? You want to make it about us, fine, make it about us. This one is a guide to your future. What's the story with these two dogs? It's just one dog howling at the moon under its spell. This one is a wolf. It represents the animal nature of man. The crayfish is fear. This trail is your journey. And these towers are a threshold between shadow and light. That's gonna be your choice, darkness or light. So this girl, will she go for me? I can't see why she would. What the fuck? Why does it seem like you want me - to be an asshole? - Are you kidding? You come back all of the sudden, and you haven't told me why you left or what you were doing or where you went, acting like you're just a victim of circumstance. Do you know what "surrendering to fate" means? - It means stop pretending. - I'm not pretending anything. Then what the hell happened to you?! Nothing. - I got sick of being here. - Sick of me. Sick of life. So? So I drifted around for a while. I wound up in Eugene, Oregon. Living with these kids for about a year. - Kids, like children? - Basically. Seventeen, eighteen-year-old. I helped 'em build a skate ramp. It was cool. They thought I was like the Godfather or something. Then, one night, we went out to the middle of nowhere to take some mushrooms. I bought beer. It was a normal night. And then they just kicked the shit out of me, like a dozen teenagers kicking me in the head and the stomach till I blacked out. I woke up, they had taken my clothes and my money and just left me there. - Why? - Guess they just decided I was some asshole. What happened? Nothing. I ended up in the hospital a couple days, collapsed lungs, some broken ribs, that's it. No, I mean, did you call the cops? - No. - Why not? It would have been complicated. How so? I'd been hanging out with a couple of the girls. One of them wasn't quite 18. - Are you fucking stupid? - I know, okay? I got picked up for DWI a couple weeks later. They sent me up to this halfway house. It's probably the best thing that could have happened to me. Listen, I was a fucking scumbag. I'm just trying to get things back on track here. You're just gonna live in a cabin in the woods? Fuck yeah, that's exactly what I'm gonna do. I have to get back to the store. Wait. What are you gonna do in the wintertime? How are you gonna make a living here? I don't know. I'll figure something out. No one's gonna hire you for anything. Nobody likes you. - People like me. - No, they don't. They know you. They don't like you. Sierra... You like me. You used to anyway. Why are you helping me, I thought you were my friend? Can I stay here? You smell like wet dog. I've been meaning to air it out. - Where'd you go? - To a bar with some friends. - Craig? - He was there. - Where is he now? - Blacked out somewhere. It doesn't matter. - Stop. - Why? - Because you're drunk. - No, I'm not. You wouldn't be here if you weren't. - You want me to go? - You don't have a car. - You could drive me. - No thanks. - What should we do then? - Just get some sleep. Sierra? - Sierra? - What? I should probably take you home, right? - What? - Don't you think I should take you home? Why? Craig doesn't give a shit. You're not worried about it? Just let me sleep, okay? Slide over, you're hurting my arm. You regret it? No, I don't regret it. Me either. Can I see you again? Soon, I mean. Not in like a month. - I don't know. When? - Tonight? I have plans tonight. I got work to do anyway. On your cabin? - It's almost finished. - Really? - You don't want to show me? - When? Last night? You can see it when it's done. - Okay, when it's done. - How about Friday? That's the day, just like that? Just say you'll come over on Friday. Fine. I'll come over. I wasn't sure you'd still be here. - Where else would I be? - I don't know. You never come around. You could be anywhere. There's nothing keeping you here. I could put this property up for sale, take care of it. You pay me in advance on my commission. I'm really not interested. - What are you doing up there? - Building a cabin with my bare fucking hands. - Someone's paying you? - No, it's mine. I'm on my way to the casino. I need a thousand dollars. No way. Give me a thousand dollars. A thousand dollars, and you'll never see me again. Wait here. This is 600 bucks. - If you win, I want it back. - When have I ever won? Where's Sierra? Fine. Give me a pack of menthols and a box of rubbers. You need a couch. I know. I hope you don't mind I let myself in. Of course not. What do you think? It's something. I got steaks, I got macaroons, I got candles. - What? - Nothing. Sounds romantic. - You're drinking? - I'm celebrating. Craig and I split up. Whoa. I thought you'd have more to say about that. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm great. Like you said, I was wasting my time with him. Well... It was definitely long overdue. Definitely. So, anyway... I'm happy you're here. I have an idea. Have a drink with me. - Sierra... - Oh, come on, just a little bit. Can't we just... See? No big deal. So you're done with your cabin. What are you gonna do now? I still have furniture to build, outhouse. I'll be at it for a couple more weeks. - Have another one. - No, I've had enough. You barely had any. Come on, I don't want to drink alone. It'll be fine, I promise. Cheers. I told my mom that I'd been seeing you around. You know, it's the oddest thing. She pretended like she didn't remember who you were. I mean, I think she was pretending. How old do you have to be to start losing your mind? She wants me to move down to South Carolina with her and her husband. He does oil paintings for these hotel rooms. Not quite on velvet, but, like, that idea. He just churns them out. Like the guy with the 'fro on TV. She gave me one. I could give it to you. You could hang it in here. - What? - Huh? ♪ Then we walk in flowered fields ♪ ♪ All covered in sunlight ♪ ♪ And now we find ourselves right here ♪ ♪ In the darkened night ♪ ♪ But the night won't hold us close because I have your love ♪ ♪ It comes up from a higher place ♪ ♪ I'd say it's from above ♪ ♪ So don't give up and don't you care of things that matter not ♪ ♪ Just be glad for all you have, for everything you've got ♪♪ Like you. - What's it say? - I have no idea. I just keep pulling the cards till I see what I want. Kinda loses all meaning. You could stop. - I'm starving. - Want me to pick something up? I can get donuts. - You don't mind? - I don't mind. Not donuts, though. Get me an egg sandwich on a Portuguese roll with sausage and cheese and a coffee with milk. No problem.
