Look around you. Seven out of ten people you meet will admit to being movie lovers. And if you get close enough, you'll almost be able to hear them thinking about movies. My life is so Bridget Jones's Diary. But where's my Hugh Grant? I want to take a dance class so that my body will become like J.Lo's in Shall We Dance. I love The Last Samurai. Tom Cruise is so cool. I love The Last Samurai. Tom Cruise is so sexy. I really liked the cast. Annette Bening... Most of these people have had their lives changed or been inspired by a film, including my friends. This is Andi, a true punk devotee. He only believed in chaos and anti-establishment ideas. But after watching Bad Boys, he was so inspired that he joined the police academy. This is my friend Pipin. A total nerd. He'd never been able to establish a social connection with anyone. But after watching A Beautiful Mind, he created many imaginary friends. Abel. A hard rock guitarist. Used to believe that a man's manhood is measured by what's in his hands. But after watching Bring it On, he decided to become a cheerleader. Film. Probably the greatest blessing that art has ever given to mankind. We are familiar with the process of moviemaking. Write the script. Then, you have to find the financial backup. - This movie will win in many festivals. - Is it profitable? The theme is very important. I don't give a damn about that. Will it be profitable or not? Then, the movie will be shot. Cut! Got it. Edited. Excuse me! And after several press conferences... You can always tell a filmmaker's character by their films. So, my question is, why are your movies always about S-E-X? Because I love sex. N-E-X-T. Next! And after an expensive gala premiere... The actors are getting richer and richer, but the crew stays poor. Tell me about it. Hey! I'm the one who made her look pretty! Only then can a movie be seen at the cinema. But there are only a few who are aware of my important role in the overall process. I'm the man behind the scenes. I'm the one who determines whether you can see a movie at the cinema or not. Yes. I'm a film delivery man. Let me tell you how important my job is. Let's count how many movie theaters there are in the city. Every day, these theaters play the same titles. The ideal thing is each theater should have one print of each title. However, our film importers are clever profiteers. They only buy one print for every two theaters. CINEMA in normal cases, each title is divided into six film reels, or up to two reels for Indian movies. But with all due respect to Indian movie devotees, we're not going to talk about Indian films here. These six film reels must be played in two theaters by turns. Two reels at a time. That's why there's a time difference between the screenings of a movie between the two cinemas. Whatever movie you're watching, every time this mark appears, it means the reel is close to its end, and the role of the delivery man is crucial for the continuity of the movie. This job requires reliable people. Otherwise, this sign will appear on your theater screen. WE ARE SORRY PLEASE WAIT FOR THE REEL TO COME I've never been late delivering film reels. Trust me, this is not an easy task. But I'll never forget the oath I took before taking on this important job. PUNCTUAL! RELIABLE! My name is Joni. And this is my promise. I've always believed that as long as you are dedicated to your work, you won't be bothered by other thoughts. You won't be bothered by the fact that you're 22 and have never had a girlfriend 'cause you won't have time for romance anyway. - You made us late for watching the film. - We're not late yet, Otto. You know I only want to sit in the middle area. That's where the surround sound is best. Why pay so much to see a movie if you can't enjoy it at its best? Did you bring my lunch? You should have lunch like normal people. This thing will kill you. Well, I'm ready to go. What's with you? What do you mean? You were exhaling when you were entering this room. You seem preoccupied right now. Oh, nothing. I just saw the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. Finally, you got attracted by a woman. I thought you were having some problem with that. Did you try to get to know her? Well, it can't be that simple. Why not? It's just unprofessional. Jon, the best place to meet your woman is at your workplace. This very theater is where I met my wife for the first time. Of course. But she was a ticket checker. So? What's wrong with that? Oh, I know what you mean. She was a ticket checker and I'm a projectionist. So, we belong in the same class. And the woman you just saw must be out of our league. Joni, I expected better from you. No, that's not it. Jon, life is just like a movie theater. If you're slow, it will start without you. It won't wait for you. Of course it'll wait for me. I've got the film reels. Should I just approach her and ask for her phone number? What does Mr. Ucok know? We are living in a world of classes. Besides, I don't even know whether the man is her boyfriend or not. I'm going up there. Maybe someone can buy a ticket for me. Otto, please don't. We'll wait until our turn comes. You should be the one trying to get those tickets. I can't believe you're so calm after making us late! Excuse me, could you pick up two tickets for me? They invented the concept of queuing for a reason. So that those who come first can get the tickets first. Why would we have to stand in line if someone else could pick up tickets for us? Grow up, will you? If you want to say no, say it, there's no need to lecture me, man. Hey, can you pick up two tickets for me? What's in it for me? I can pay for yours. I came with my friends. There are three of us. See? I got them. C'mon, that movie is bullshit. No, I totally buy it. It's cool. There's only one true love for each person. And that someone is called your soul mate. But how do you recognize your soul mate? When your heart tells you so. You're a chronic hopeless romantic, you know that? That's the design, man. What if you can live with someone who's not your soul mate? Jennifer Aniston said in The Object of My Affection that love is all about choosing someone and making it work. Then you're just compromising, man. I don't want to do that. So, have you found your soul mate yet? Silly you. Do I really have to answer that? This is seat 30 N, and that is the closest to the screen and next to the wall, man! Hey, man. You're lucky I got you tickets. I already paid for you and your friends. There was no need to ask you to get these. I could have got them by standing in line. The seats you wanted were already taken. You could have bought ones near that seat, right? I'm sorry then. I'm gonna report you to security for scalping. Go ahead. Many witnesses saw that you were the one who asked for it. - What do you want? - And you? What do you want? - Shall we settle this outside? - It's up to you. Excuse me, but did you see the girl who came with that man in the funny pants? Let's settle it here! Don't interfere! She's gone, man. Whoa. If I had a boyfriend like him, I would have gone too. But I'd bitch-slap him first. Oh, don't worry. I will never bitch-slap you, baby. I'll meet you at the parking lot. Why do we have to go to the parking lot? Still upset about not getting the best seat? I told my boyfriend to build his own theater. So, he is your boyfriend. You must be wanting to know why girls stick with pain-in-the-neck boyfriends. I don't think so. I'm not qualified to give any comment. I've never been in a relationship. So, you're a film delivery man? How did you know that? I can see. Really? Not too many people notice it. I notice it. So, how long have you been working here? Almost a year. Part-time. I go to college in the morning and deliver film reels in the afternoon. Why do you want to be a film delivery man? Please don't get offended because I think what you're doing is cool. No offense taken. Besides, I love this job. And actually, my family has been in this kind of business for generations. - Delivering film reels? - No, I mean the delivery business. What do you mean? My father was a postal worker. Post. During the 20 years he worked, he never delivered a letter to the wrong address. My grandfather was a hired musician. He delivered the message of love through songs. Twenty years he was doing his job, until one day he met my grandma. After that, he quit his job because my grandma always got jealous if my Grandpa sang a love song for another woman. So, what did he do then? Then, he changed his profession and became a debt collector. His profession was still a delivery man. Delivering a message to people. During his ten years as a debt collector, he never failed to collect the debt. Following my ancestor's footsteps, here I am now as a delivery man. I've been delivering film reels for almost a year, and I've never been late. May I know your name? I tell you what. You deliver our film reels and make sure that the film doesn't stop in the middle. Then I'll tell you my name. Deal? You must have a beautiful name. It requires completing a feat just to know it. So you won't easily forget it. What's your name? I also don't want you to easily forget my name. What the hell are you doing out here? Don't you know that I almost got ganged up on in there? Otto, if you don't like the seats, let's just come back tomorrow. I told you, I only want to see movies the first day they are shown. The film will be all scratched on the second day. You know how careless theater employees are in this country. What are you doing? Is he bothering you? He's the film delivery man. He just passing through. So why the hell are you still here? Don't you have film reels to deliver? You're not supposed to get friendly with the delivery man. He's not in our league. If I could only be friendly with people in your league, I wouldn't have any friends at all. What's that supposed to mean? ADAM SUBANDI'S ART EXHIBITION "STOLEN GOODS" THIS SUNDAY As a delivery man, you always compete with time. But you still have time to see many kinds of people. After one year of working, I'm able to make ten classifications. First. The attention-seeking viewer. My mother asked me to drink herbal medicine. My God. It's so retro. Hello, in this age, where everything is so sophisticated, do you still believe in things that you simply squeeze? Oh my God! Remember the handsome guy who plays basketball? He's calling me. Hi, Sammy. Second. The picnic viewer. Third. The dating viewer. Fourth. The pirating viewer. Fifth. The spoiler audience. Later, that guy will kidnapped by the bad guy. But he escapes and meets the girl he loves. Sixth. Film critics. But I don't know about these guys. Are they really serious about their work? Or are they just showing off that they're film critics? One thing's for sure. I never believe what a film critic has written. Seventh. The cell phone viewer. Hello? Yeah, I am watching a movie. Shut up! Eighth. The sleeping viewer. Ninth. The idiot viewer. What happened? How come he died? He's been shot. Oh, I see. With what? A gun. I see. Really? Tenth. The perfectionist viewer. Excuse me. What should I call you? Just Mr. Ucok. Ah, Mr. Ucok. How much do you earn in a month? Why? I know that movie projectionist is not well-paid. But it doesn't mean that you should do your job half-heartedly. Do you even notice that the film is out of focus? Really? I missed five minutes of the film because of you. Next time, please do your job right. How come he's alive again? I thought he was shot. Hey, can you be quiet? I know a lot about movie viewers. But I know nothing about women. What I know is, I will never let this woman down. A viewer came here earlier complaining that the film was out of focus. I think I'll have to change my glasses because when I checked, it turned out that it was just fine. Which one was that person? The one sitting at the very front on the very right. Don't worry about that. The film is fine. He's just crazy. Have you tried to get to know the girl yet? Yeah. After this movie, I may even go to dinner with her tonight. Tonight is my last shift. Is the boyfriend coming? I don't know. I hope not. If he's coming, I should come too. I haven't seen a war in a long time. I think it's gonna be interesting. ADAM SUBANDI'S ART EXHIBITION "STOLEN GOODS" THIS SUNDAY Mr. Ucok? If I don't come back from the war, please give this flower to that girl. Oh. I thought it was for me. I thought you'd lost your mind. How long have you been standing here? About two hours, son. My God. C'mon, let me get you across. Okay, here we are. If not for you, I would have lost my faith in humanity in this city. Don't be like that. I bet if you had asked someone, they would have helped you. There are still many good people in Jakarta. Hey! - Sir! Someone just stole my motorbike! - Where is it? - It's gone. The thief just ran past you. - Where did you park? - Over there. - Did you lock it? - No. I thought it would only be a moment. - Well that's your own fault. - You should have locked it. - So what should we do now? Come with me to the station to make an official report. - Can't we go after the thief first? - I didn't bring my vehicle with me. If you come to the station, maybe my friend can help you chase him. Never mind, I have to go. Taxi! But you have to make an official report. Hey, remember! Always lock your motorbike every time you park! Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Metropolitan Building. Please hurry. Do you work there or are you going shopping? I am on my way to work. - Really? At which department? - At the theater. I see. - How is working there? Good? - Yeah, it's good. - How about the paycheck? - Enough. When someone says enough, it means it's not enough. No, it's really enough. - Are you married? - No, I'm not. How old are you? Twenty-two. You still want to be free, right? But if I can give you some advice, don't wait too long. You'll regret it, just like me. I'm already 50 years old. I just got married nine months ago. I never thought of getting married at all. All I did was fight. I used to be a thug before, you know. But I'm an obedient civilian now. My wife will deliver our baby soon. I'm so thrilled. I also suffer when she's pregnant. The pregnancy makes her like to beat me up. She pulls my hair sometimes and kicks me. Maybe that's the baby's desire. But I am sure the baby will be a boy. I will be so thrilled if it's a boy. 'Cause I only got sisters. How about you? How many brothers? - Four. - And how many brothers? - All of them are boys. - My goodness. You guys must have fought all the time. You know, I also want to have four sons. But since I got married too late, I'm not sure I'll be able to have them. Because they say the sperm becomes lazy when you get older. I hope you'll be able to. Actually, I'm really grateful to have children. I can't imagine if my wife had four more pregnancies. She would have the desire to torture me like this. I'd be tortured, beaten up, and kicked all the time. Do I have to get tortured like that for four years? And I have to go home early today. I don't want my wife to deliver the baby without me being there by her side. Ouch. What's the matter, ma'am? I've already told my wife not to go out anymore. But, you know, she's a strong-headed woman. She still likes to go out to buy groceries. Hey! Mister! My wife's belly is as big as that woman's. Listen up! I'm so tired... God in Heaven! That's my wife! - Please hold it. - Sir! Help her, sir! - This is my wife! - Aren't you too old to be her husband? You're too old to be my wife! You're too old to be my father! And you're too old to be my mother! - What an old guy! - No wonder you're so old. Old man! Hey! I have to go to my workplace! Please watch over my wife! Your workplace won't go anywhere! Hang on, sweetie pie! Hang on. We've almost arrived at the hospital. You don't want to deliver it right now, do you? No, no, please don't do that! It's dangerous. No, no, let her! Let her do it. Don't worry about it. My God! I don't want to die yet! I haven't even got married yet. That's why you should get married first. So you can experience beautiful moments like this. God help me! The baby hasn't come yet, has it? Hang on, pumpkin. Please hang in there. Don't let the baby come out yet. Please wait for the doctor. Hang on, honey. We're there, baby. Hang on. We're there. Please, hang on. You, wait inside, and you, please wait outside. How come I can't go in? Only the husband can go in. Parents, please just wait outside. I'm not her husband. I'm her husband. - Honey, tell him I'm your husband. - No! I don't want to have an old husband like you! Okay, then. The two of you can come inside. Doc! Hang on, pumpkin. Hang on. Relax. Is this your first child? It must be your first child. Just relax. Let me put on some music. Push, ma'am. Push. That's it. Relax. Keep on pushing. I can see the head already. Is it a boy or a girl? I can't tell yet. But it's beautiful. You hear that, honey? We've got a handsome boy. No, I can't tell that yet. I'm sure it's a boy. - Are you sure? - Fifty-fifty. Keep on pushing, ma'am! You can't catch me! Come on! You can't catch me! I'll be a doctor when I grow up. I'll be a film star. Film stars need a doctor if they get sick. I can go to a shaman. My parents don't believe in anything supernatural. They don't even believe in each other. You're so mean. Yo, Joni! What do you want to be when you grow up? I'm gonna be a film delivery man. A film delivery man! I'll be so proud if you become a film delivery man, Joni. I want to be a film delivery man too. But you must wake up now. The film is near its end. Shit! How long have I been passed out? It's a boy! I want to name him after you. What's your name? Damn! "Dem"? Dem what?! Dem Gunadem? That's a cute name. You don't need me. You're so independent. You're strong. Smart. Me? I'm just excess baggage to you. Don't you get it, Bob? I am what I am because I have you. I exist if I have you to show me the way. You are the flashlight my headlamp. Seriously, haven't you ever kissed before? Of course I have. I've had boyfriends. No wonder they always leave you. Watch this! This is how you kiss your partner. Never let others' lips in your mouth unless it's really good. But nobody kisses on the street like that in this country! Then what do you call what I have just done? And I want to kiss anywhere I like. It's up to me. I can repeat what you have done, but give me some motivation first. Your motivation is to do your best in order you get a real role. Play 609, take one! Camera! And, action! You don't need me. You're so independent. You're strong. Smart. I'm... I'm only excess baggage to you. Don't you get it, Bob? I am what I am because I have you. I exist because you're there to show me the way. You're the flashlight my headlamp. Who the hell is that? Sorry, I'm lost. Can you tell me the way out of here? We're all lost here. I can't help you. Please stay. If I have to lose you, that's a great step backward for me. I'll have to start all over again, and I'm not sure I'll be able to survive it. Okay, let's try that again one more time. But... I love your ad-lib. "We're all lost here." - Hey, what's your name? - Joni. Okay, Joni. I need you for the next shot. - For continuity. Hey, a bit tighter. - What continuity? Don't you think we should do another take of the last one? Hey, movie star! Can you repeat that scene as good as it was? - I can try, but I'm not sure about it. - Then we don't need to. But don't you think it'll be weird? We have an unknown character. How many movies have you directed? Well... none. I've always been an assistant director. - Hey! What's your name again? - Joni. Okay, Joni, now, you stand over there and repeat what you did earlier. - I can't, I have to go. - No way! - You must be in the frame for continuity. - What do you mean? We want to shoot a tighter angle, and you have to be in that frame. Otherwise, we can't get the continuity right. You were there in one frame but you weren't in the next frame. I can't. I have to deliver a film now. Please understand. I've had to deal with a lot of problems today. - Me too. - You must do it! I don't want to retake it. I'm not sure I can be that good again. But I can't stay! It's your own fault! You can't just barge onto a film set! Okay. I'm really sorry I interrupted you. But I still have to go. Listen.

She'll give you the payment. No need. I'm in such a hurry. I like that man. He's so sexy. Do you think you can get him in the next scene? Can you? Wait. She just wore a bikini. Wasn't she wearing a tank top? It's the next day already. Her friend just said goodnight, remember? Oh, I see. So if somebody says good night, it means it's the next day? It's not like that. But that was the previous night, and now it's the next morning and it's daylight... - Hey, can you shut up? - Hey keep it down! Hey, it wasn't me, it was these two! You shut up! I'll shut up if these two shut up! We didn't make any noise. That's it! You want to settle this outside? What should we do outside? We're watching this movie. Okay, come on. Security! Help! This man's crazy! Security, help! He's mad! Security! Security, he's going crazy! - He just hit me for no reason. - Can you come outside with me, please? I don't want to. I want to watch! - You made a commotion in here. - It wasn't me! It was them! No need to shout. You're annoying others. They annoyed me first! Say one more thing and I'll drag you out myself. Fine. But I'll never come to this theater ever again! Are you coming? Fine! But don't ever see me again! Get your greasy hands off me! Help! What was she doing? Why is she dead? She got shot again? - Help! - Let it go! - Thief! Help! - Let it go! Thief! Help! - Help me, please! - Let it go! - Thief! Help me! - Just let it go! Help! Thief! Hey, let go of that girl! Mind your own business! Go away! You better believe me. I don't want to get involved with this. I have to be at my workplace in 30 minutes. So, how about you let her go and I can get to work too? Why don't you just fuck off?! Because I still have a good conscience and I can let you rob this woman. You want to fight me? Violence has never been a good solution, man. But I won't mind kicking a thief's butt to fight the street crime. Who the hell do you think you are? Spider-Man? Let me ask you a question, Spidey. Why, in this age, is there still someone who wants to be a hero? Beats me, man. I helped an old blind man across earlier and my motorcycle got stolen. So why do you want to help somebody else this time? I guess I'm not as apathetic and cynical as you are. After this, I'm sure you will become that too. Hey! Where the hell are you going? Our discussion isn't over! Shit! Looking for a girl wearing jeans and a jean jacket in the bright daylight? Have you seen her? - Hair this long? - Yes. Height 158 cm, weight 45 kg? Well, that I don't know. - She's my sister. - Thank God! - Where is she? - I don't know. Shame on you for trying to bribe me. I'm not trying to bribe you. I'm just offering you money so you can buy more ice cream. I'm young, but I'm not stupid. Besides, I still have more ice cream. Not stupid, huh? Now, tell me where she is. Listen. Even if I tell you where she is, it's not because you bribed me. I'm not a snitch. Okay, you're not a snitch. And she's my own sister. - I won't do her any harm. - That's good. 'Cause if you do, you will have to face me in the flesh. I'll totally freak out if that happens. I won't do anything to her. Now that we understand each other, let's go then. - Why are you looking for my sister anyway? - We got business. - What's your name? - Joni. Joni? Mine's Toni. Joni Toni. Joni and Toni are walking together to look for Voni. Your sister's name is Voni? And we've got a little brother named Boni. Do you like it, or you haven't got a meal? I'm starving. Haven't you had lunch? This is my lunch. Do you always have ice cream as your lunch? I'm poor, Jon. I eat anything that's available. You're too chubby to be a poor boy. Who says all poor kids have to be skinny? I have a poor metabolism, so even if I only eat a little, it'll always turn into fat. How do you know all that? I read my Men's Health. You don't believe me? That means you've insulted poor people twice. First, you said we can't be chubby. Second, you don't believe we read Men's Health Magazine. I didn't say I didn't believe you. I'm just amazed that a little boy could talk like that. There. You insulted me again. You think poor kids can't be smart like me! I didn't say you were smart. You hurt my feelings one more time and I'm going home. Is your sister at home? Of course not! Okay, let me know where she is and I'll promise to shut up. Good. We're there. Are you guys ready? Our drummer is not here yet. I can't wait for too long, man. I have a meeting with a major label executive in 15 minutes. He's on his way here. He'll be here in here in a minute. How do you know? Did he call you? None of you guys have cell phones. If he said he would come then he'll come, man. Look, I put my neck on the line to give you guys a chance. I'm just trying to help you out. - Please don't screw it up. - Okay, okay. Five minutes is all we ask. After that, you can go. I've come to a point where I'm ready to break your face. Wait, I can explain! I don't need an explanation. I need my bag. Where is it? - I don't have it. - Then where is it? - Does Voni have it? Where is she? - She doesn't either. Somebody else does. But I can give you the address. Is this your drummer? You think I'm stupid? What if you give the wrong one? Is this your drummer or not? I can come and show you, but I have to attend an audition first. I don't give a shit. Just look at my friends! We've already spent a lot of money to pay for practice and to rent equipment. We've never had a chance to be heard until today. Please don't kill their dream because of what I did. So this is not your drummer? All right, I'll give you time for your audition. But after that, you have to come with me. We can do that, but our drummer isn't here yet. Your five minutes is almost up, Jeff. Okay then, I'll play the drums. After that, you have to come with me. Can you play the drums? There's only one way to find out isn't there? Come out, Voni! Don't worry, I'm okay. Strolled away from my true aim Had to force myself, trapped in a circle If only you knew Hiding to hide the grudge My day's too dark But I've been indecisive Since the beginning If only you knew Had to wait Until one time We can meet And I'll tell you about All those worries Till they fade away Till they fade away This condition made my heart wish quietly And no one ever knows Even if this chance slips away And we feel regret You still never know So amazing! Congratulations. You're in. How was it? - Okay. Now, you're coming with me. - Yes. I want to introduce you to people from that major label. I can't. I have to go. You're a fool if you let this one go. No can do. He has to come with me. And who are you? His pimp? I'll come with you. This is all my fault anyway. Whatever. I'll come with you too. He's gonna be your drummer for good, right? I dunno. He's got a bad temper. Next time, before you steal something, check if it's a valuable thing. I know. There are only film reels in the bag. Huh? Film? What film? Don't tell me it's Pokémon. That's too childish, right? What are you? Vocalist-slash-thief? Voni's a thief? No way. My folks ain't raising anybody to be a thief. My late father used to say, "Do whatever to stay alive but never steal..." - We stole to pay for the audition. - I bet you couldn't sell the bag. We did. We sold it to Adam Subandi. In fact, he was the one who told me to steal. Who's Adam Subandi? You've never heard of Adam Subandi? You've never heard of Adam Subandi? No, I haven't. Who is he? A gangster? He's a lot scarier than a gangster. He's got magical powers. Actually, he's an artist. But with magical powers! Every year, he disappears for three months to meditate in a cave on a haunted mountain in Java. Have you ever heard about the five young men from around here who disappeared? No, I haven't. Five young men from around here just disappeared. Rumor says that they did not actually disappear. It's widely known that Adam Subandi keeps a fortune in his house. He got it after he did a ceremonial meditation in Java. So, they went there to steal it when Adam Subandi left town. But it turned out that Adam Subandi hadn't left town. The next day, Adam Subandi got five new pets. A snake, an iguana, a turtle, and two frogs. Can you imagine that? If you had to become a pet for the rest of your life? If this Adam Subandi doesn't like people stealing from him, why did he ask you to steal? He's preparing an art exhibition. It's called, "Stolen Goods." Everything that will be on display there will have been stolen. So, I'm in it. I still can't believe that you're a thief. Our late father used to say stealing was the lowest crime in the world. What if I or the other people that he stole from report him to the cops? Two months ago, Adam Subandi was arrested. He's still in jail now. He's still there now? What do you mean? If you go to jail, you'll see Adam Subandi there. Ouch! It's broken, Von. But if you go to his house now, perhaps you will see him in there too. I told you. He's got magical powers. - If you bring your bag, hold it tight. - I never thought about it. - There she is. - Well, I'll be damned. Who is he? He must be one of your victims, right? No, he is not! Don't worry I have good verbal skills. Let me persuade them. How can you persuade them if you get beaten first? Thief! Get them! Burn them! Kill them! Thief! Thief! Hey! Hey! Thief! I can't run anymore! I have a bad metabolism! - All right. Let's hide up there! - Go on, up there. Faster, Toni. They're coming. Hide in there! - It stinks in here. - Don't complain. - I think they're gone. - Wait a minute. We have to hurry and get my bag! You want to get burned by them? Have you ever heard about the people who got burned in the terminal just because somebody yelled at them and called them thieves? I have work to do. And I have to take the risk. Hey, can you guys get me down? I'm acrophobic! Look, I'm really sorry. Shame on you, sis. Was it you or your boyfriend who came up with the idea? I did. But he's not my boyfriend. She's never had one, you know. How about you? None of your business. What's the matter? Nothing. Let me see. No, let's just go. No, let me see first. Is it from the running? No, it has been like this for days. My new sneakers aren't that comfortable. These don't look new. She bought them at a pawn shop. Someone stole her old sneakers. They were so comfortable, you know? Is the house still far away? No. You see that corner? It's the second house on the left. All right, you just stay here. No, I'll be going with you. No way. If this man is as dangerous as you described, you'd better stay here. Let me go in there. But it's my fault. Nah, I've forgiven you already. - But Toni can come. - No thanks. I don't want to turn into an iguana. If he turns you into an iguana and me into a frog, you'll surely eat me, right? Iguanas don't eat frogs, stupid. Well, this is it. See you around. Jon? Be careful. My exhibition isn't open yet. You've come too early. I'm here to get my stuff. Which stuff? A big bag containing film reels. Things that have been stolen... You'd better let them go. I would if they were mine. But they aren't mine. I only have the responsibility of delivering them. Is this the one? Take one step forward, and I'll burn it. Please don't. Give me one reason why I shouldn't burn this lousy bag. This doesn't fit in my exhibition. Because it's of no use to you, why don't you just give it back to me? Wrong answer! Wrong! Wait! Because my career depends on whether I can deliver the bag or not. What exactly do you do? I deliver film reels. And you take it as a career? Why not? You sound smart, but why you did become such an underachiever? You could have gotten a better job if you'd wanted to. How do you define a better job? One that gives me more money? Isn't that true? Man, you disappoint me. For an artist, you're too shallow. Elaborate. The right job is the one that makes you happy doing it. And you're happy delivering film reels? Yeah. Because delivery is the basis of any kind of communication. It connects people. Remember the prophets? They're also in the delivery business, delivering God's messages to humans. You really thought I'd buy your bullshit? Apparently, you don't. You got that right! Don't! That was my old bag. You also bought this at Blok M, right? Here. - Can you get me to the Metropole building? - I'm not on duty. - Metropole building? - We're all off-duty We're on a strike. Taxi! Good afternoon. Good afternoon, handsome. - Cancel that. - Okay. EMERGENCY What the hell are you doing in here? Just until the road up ahead. You can't do that. - What happened to him? - Heart attack. - What's that? - Film, sir. He's traumatized by films. A few months ago, a young filmmaker asked us to be his executive producers. And the film was a flop? It's a huge hit. But we refused to fund the film back then, and he is so regretful. You told me that the film would be unprofitable. I said if you used big-name actors, it would sell! But you're such a cheapskate! You made me invest in that TV station instead, and now it's gone bankrupt. We couldn't even pay for the catering! It was your spiritual advisor who advised us to invest in that TV station! How did we become business partners? You've got no sense of business at all! - You're the one who's stupid! - You are such an idiot. I wish I'd never met you! You're a devil from hell! I wish I'd never known you at all. - You're fucking stupid! - Stop the car! EMERGENCY AMBULANCE DKI JAKARTA PROVINCE WE ARE SORRY PLEASE WAIT FOR THE REEL TO COME Excuse me. Did you just watch Blue Biru? I did, but it didn't finish. Everybody else has gone. I was the last to leave. I failed. Not really. The movie stopped before it ended, right? My track record is not clean anymore. And the sequence is lost because of me. What happened to you? Someone stole my bike, and then I had to take part in a film. I've been chased by a group of people in the market. My bag got stolen. I had to meet a crazy artist... But you're here. And only a couple of minutes late. Yeah, but I still failed. You know what? I'm still curious how the movie ends. I got the ending right here. - Angelique. - What? My name's Angelique. It is a beautiful name. I'm Joni. Do you know the projectionist? Yeah, we're good friends. Why? Do you think you can talk him into playing the last reel for me? My boyfriend would eat his heart out, knowing that I could sit in the middle. Oops. I mean ex-boyfriend. Gotcha! You fell in love, didn't you? If only I'd met him this morning. But you always wake up at noon. Come on, let's go. What? That's it? So quick. What about the ending? It's not the right amount. Sir. I still haven't been able to sell the motorbike. I'm gonna go now. I have a band audition. I'm playing the drums. My friends are waiting for me. Please look after the motorbike. See you!
