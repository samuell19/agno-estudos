[NARRATOR READING] I remember this place. Eduardo and I came riding here the day before I left for home. Three months ago. It seems like countless ages. I hope you realize you're a very fortunate young lady. Usually a marriage between families such as ours is hardly more than a matter of convenience, not an affair of the heart. You don't know how grateful I am that you gave me the opportunity to know him completely before we were formally betrothed. You might pretend to show just a little sorrow at the thought of leaving your father to enter into a new land, a new life. I'm sorry to be so selfish, but all I can think of is Eduardo. And in just a little while, I'll see him again. Silvio. Yes, Your Excellency? Tell him to stir up the horses, man. At this rate, we won't reach Castle Alleta until after dark. Yes, My Lord. Stir them up.[SHOUTS] NARRATOR: For generations the Castle Alleta had stood as a symbol of authority in the land where the young Duke Eduardo had recently come to the throne. But now, Eduardo's subjects were beginning to become uneasy, for there were things happening in the castle which they could not understand. Their Highnesses Prince Bruno and Princess Sybil. I'm sure, Eduardo, if your uncle deigns to pay us a visit, he either brings bad news, or hopes to find it here. I trust that you are well, dear nephew. Why this air of solicitude? Well, there are rumors that Your Grace might not be enjoying the best of health. I hope you're not disappointed to find the rumors unfounded. Your Grace, you do us an injustice. Then illness is not the reason why Your Grace cancelled the Fiesta of the Throne of Alleta? His Grace has cancelled it on the grounds of economy. I doubt His Grace's people will be happy with such an explanation. It is I who must answer to the people. You will not reconsider? Uh, the people certainly will not object to the expense. EDUARDO: No. Well, it is on your head and not on mine. Then this is the first time you have expressed satisfaction at not being in my place. Then, with Your Grace's permission, we will relieve you of our very unwelcome presence here. You have it.Your Grace. You were right, they came here hoping to find bad news. Perhaps Grimaldi's report was wrong. Eduardo seemed all right. Not to me. He's hiding something. I could see it in his eyes. I'll send him back here, let him sniff around again. We'll need more than rumors to hold over His Grace's head. NARRATOR: The suspicions of Prince Bruno were not without foundation, for Alleta was ruled by Eduardo, only by day. When the sun would sink beyond the distant horizon, Eduardo compelled everyone, except his Chancellor Orsini, to leave the castle. As night shadows began to engulf the land, Eduardo and Orsini began their lonely vigil. Eduardo's subjects could not be told that the young duke was living two lives, and that by day he had to hide the torment that gripped his soul. For no one could know of the evil curse that overtook him when darkness fell, a curse that only he and Orsini must face. Eduardo, you are inflicting added suffering upon yourself. You would be safe enough locked within your own door. No, Orsini. How do I know what might come over me when it is upon me? Perhaps I should have you chain me to the wall. You've never been violent. I guess I should be grateful for that blessing. Orsini, what if I should become a thing, a thing of pure evil? ORSINI: I dare not even think of it. To know that I have to subject you to this every night, it is enough. The sun... It's gone. I can feel it coming. I want to fight it. How do you defeat an enemy you can't see? Strange, you'd think the place deserted, and it isn't that late. I didn't notice a guard at the gates. Did you, Silvio? There was none, My Lord. In fact, there doesn't seem to be a soul about the whole place. Well, wake them up. Let them know we're here. Yes, My Lord. This is not exactly the warm welcome I pictured in my mind. Nor I. Of course, Eduardo had no reason to expect us so soon. NARRATOR: On the shoulders of Orsini had fallen the sad and difficult task of keeping Eduardo's secret from the world, no matter what excuses he had to give, or what falsehoods he had to conceal. Someone is coming, My Lord. If you have business with His Grace, return after sunrise in the morning. You're talking to His Excellency, the Count of Sardi. Count Roderick?Yes, Orsini. Count Roderick. And the Lady Althea. Good heavens, man, are you going to keep us standing out here the rest of the night? A thousand pardons, My Lord. If our arrival is an inconvenience, perhaps we should seek shelter elsewhere? Forgive me, Your Excellency. Come. Silvio, bring in the luggage.Yes, My Lord. It's good to see you again, Baron Orsini. And you, My Lady. And more beautiful than ever. You will forgive me if I seem a trifle startled at your arrival tonight. Is it a state of crisis that we arrived a few days earlier than planned? No. When did Your Excellency leave Sardi? A week ago. Then the courier from His Grace did not reach you? With a personal message from Duke Eduardo? Concerning what? My Lord, I would not presume to discuss His Grace's personal affairs. Spoken like a true diplomat. Well, we are here, Orsini, take us to Eduardo. He can tell us the import of his message. I'm sure he will see you and the Lady Althea the first thing in the morning. We won't see him tonight? I'm afraid not. His Grace is indisposed. Ill? Oh, probably one too many farewell bachelor dinners, eh, Orsini? Huh? Well, I'm ready for bed myself. Come along with the luggage. If your servants will just leave the luggage here, I will see that it is delivered to your rooms. Oh, very well. That'll be all, Silvio. See to the horses, huh?Yes, My Lord. Please stay closely, My Lord. Because of the darkness. Well, I must say our meal was more refreshing than our reception here tonight. You know, this is the first time I've ever had my food served by the chancellor of a duchy. I'm sure Eduardo will have a perfectly reasonable explanation. The entire place in darkness. No servants about. Locked doors, no guard at the gates. Eduardo's explanation will have to be more than reasonable. Father, when you asked why Eduardo didn't meet us this evening, it was you who offered an excuse, not Orsini. Well, now. Bride-grooms-to-be do have their farewell bachelor dinners, you know. Everything always looks worse when you're tired. I'm sure Eduardo will have your perfectly reasonable explanation in the morning. Good night, my dear. Sleep well. Good night. [LATCH RATTLING] NARRATOR: In the morning, when the sun warmed the countryside once again, and the nightmares of darkness were gone, the young duke returned to his duties as ruler of the land. And then, my neighbor, this jackass, let his cow stray into my vegetable patch. Each of my wonderful vegetables has been raised by the sweat of my brow, And that... That stupid fool of a cow ate a whole row of my very best carrots. Therefore, I claim the right to hold his cow in payment for damages. And how many of this man's fine carrots did your cow eat? It couldn't be many, Your Grace. She has such a delicate appetite. Well, then, it is my judgment that you return to Benito his cow. BENITO: Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you. But you must give to Pasquale his damages, all the milk your cow produces today, because it was made from his carrots. PASQUALE: Thank you, Your Grace. You have my leave to go. You seem to have lost your uneasiness of last night very quickly. It seems so silly now that I should have been disturbed. Sometimes that imagination of yours is a little too vivid. You weren't so easy in your own mind.Oh. Eduardo!I see you, and I forget all the words I rehearsed to welcome you home. Perhaps you might remember with a little prompting. They were meant to be spoken in the special garden. I seem to remember such a garden. Do you mind, Your Excellency? Would it make any difference if I did? No. Ah, to be young again, Orsini, and in love. To be young again, yes. But this and all it represents, it is the only love I've ever known. [READING] It's exquisite. Wear it over your heart. And when you look at it, think of me as I am now. I am thinking of how much I love you. Althea, if something should force me to... To beg for a postponement of our marriage, would you grant it? For how long? I am hoping I will not have to ask it. Well, I'd be unhappy about it, disappointed, but of course I'd grant it, if you thought it necessary. Even if I could give you no excuse? Could only ask you to believe in me? To have faith? Can there be love without faith? Without trust? You are serious? You're not trying to tease me?I am serious. Do you fear to confide in me? Are you trying to tell me that you find yourself in some great trouble, from which you think I should be shielded? Since you have been gone, I have learned that there are certain things which must be faced alone. Then you would rather I returned home? For your sake only. If it were in my power, I'd never let you leave. If you need help, then it's my duty to stay. From now on, there's nothing you have to face alone. I hope you will never change, no matter what may happen, no matter what you may come to think. Hope and pray with me that there will be no postponement to our marriage. When I found myself face to face with her, I forgot all your good counsel. I could only remember how much she means to me. Yes, I knew it could be this way if she returned. That's why I prevailed upon you to send a courier to her father. If only the courier had reached him. If only she had not returned. Did you suggest a possible postponement to her? What else could I do? With the wedding less than two weeks away. She accepted it on blind faith. I felt like a cheat. You gave her no explanation, I hope? How does a man explain why he would seek release from the one thing he wants most in life? [SIGHS] For her sake, it would have been better if you could have found some pretext to break with her completely. No, I will not give her up. To do so would be to confess to myself that there is no hope. My son, I have given a lifetime of service to the Duchy of Alleta, to your father and now to Your Grace. I beg of you to be strong, to endure, for the good of your people. Endure! There have been times these past three months when I felt myself beyond endurance, going mad. You must remember, above all else, that your uncle Bruno has his eyes on this palace. That he hovers over you like a vulture. Yes, he suspects something. And if he ever found out about you, we both know that he would use it as a weapon to prove you unfit to rule. And he would not be far wrong. Did you give Lady Althea and Duke Roderick sufficient protection last night? I took the precaution of locking their chamber doors and keeping the key. I did not unlock it until this morning. NARRATOR: As the sun left the sky again and the Castle Alleta made ready for the terrors of the night, a new evil was waiting in the person of the interested observer, who watched with shrewd eyes. The man sent by Prince Bruno. Still leading the easy life, eh? Home at sundown? Ah, it's too good to last, but I hope it does. Everybody in the castle has been sent packing for the night again? Everyone but the Lady Althea and Count Roderick. What do you suppose goes on in there after His Grace locks himself in for the night? I don't know. Never a word is said when we come back in the morning. But to me there is the feel of evil. Ah, you talk too much, woman, and about nothing. Ah, can I stand you a glass of wine? Two glasses. Speaking only for myself, that is. Well, it isn't my custom to sit down to a glass with a stranger. I beg your pardon. Allow me to correct that. My name is Grimaldi. Well, I have had a trying day. Well, come then, let's be off. [PATRONS CHATTERING] Ah, there's probably nothing to it at all. Just gossip among you servants. Not much. Being dismissed from the castle at sundown every night, and not being permitted to return to our work until morning, isn't gossip. Perhaps the Duke has a liking for his solitude? Then, what's changed him? He used to be fond of company. Now, when old friends of His Grace call after nightfall, they are turned away by Baron Orsini. And with poor excuses. I still think it's just a lot of talk. I haven't dared to breathe it to a soul what I think. Oh, come now. We're all friends here, I'm sure. Well, is it possible that the Grace has sold his soul to Satan and secretly in the dead of night, he, uh, celebrates the Black Mass? I told you that it has the feel of evil. It's exactly the same as last night. Every living soul gone from the castle, as if fleeing from a plague or something. Perhaps it's better if we don't ask questions. Oh, nonsense. I made it a point to mention to Orsini again this afternoon, half-jokingly, our astonishment at finding the castle seemingly deserted and in darkness. In answer, he gave me words. Smooth words. Even about your door having been locked from the outside. What did he say about my door?That you might have been mistaken. That perhaps the door was only stuck. Perhaps I was mistaken. The sun is setting. It is here. It is here, reaching for me. Eduardo, resist. Fight it with all your strength and mind, harder than you have ever fought before. I am trying to fight it. Three months, Orsini. Every night since I took the throne. How much longer will I find the strength to fight? If only I could be of greater help. If only I could take it upon my shoulders. Leave me. I know what horror it is to look at me. I will leave you now, but only to bring you your supper. Yes, come back. We must not fail to feed the beast. I'm going to Eduardo right now, get to the bottom of this. Father. Father, please. Then you know about it? Eduardo told you? No. I only know he's in some grave trouble. Trouble? All the more reason why I should have it out with him. To decide whether I want my daughter involved in it or not. Father, Father, I ask you to have faith in him. And in me. Let me talk with him again this evening. I promise you, that if I think there's anything you can do to help Eduardo, I'll let you know at once. Eduardo. Eduardo, it's Althea. ORSINI: I'm afraid the roast fowl is cold, Eduardo. [SCREAMING] The shock of seeing you like this was too much for her. [PATRONS LAUGHING] I had need of that. From the look of your face, you have need of another. You look as if you've seen a ghost. If I didn't see one, I heard one. You sure it wasn't a cat you heard yowling? Luigi is a hostler. He's closer to the castle than any of us at night. His room is in the stables. Tell us, Luigi. What I heard was a woman screaming. Just as if she had seen the Devil himself inside the castle. I'm no coward, but her shrieks curdled my blood. I came flying here, to be among humankind. Come, come. We're sitting here like children listening to stories about hobgoblins. I don't believe in things supernatural. You would, if you'd been at that castle for the past three months. I tell you again, what all of us know, there is evil inside it. So I spent a ducat of Your Highness' money on a few liters of wine at the inn frequented by the castle servants. An investment in loosened tongues. Well spent, I hope. At times you're a little free with my money. Go on, go on, Grimaldi. Well, I trust that what I learned was worth more than a ducat. Come to the point, man. What do the servants think takes place inside the castle during the dark hours? One of them, a laundress, dared to whisper that she believes His Grace has allied himself with Satan and celebrates the Black Mass. With that holier-than-thou Orsini acting as his altar boy? It's ridiculous. It may not be as ridiculous as you think, Your Highness. A hostler, with quarters close to the castle, fled to the inn last night with a story of having heard a woman's screams from inside the castle. Horrible shrieks he called them, and he was frightened out of his wits. But if you are to be believed, the only woman who could be in the castle is the... The Lady Althea. Exactly so. And why should she scream horribly? Now, what I've heard may be no more than old wives' tales, but this I can assure Your Highnesses, the servants are in a state of nerves and dread. And ready to believe anything. Grimaldi, could you arrange it for me to get into the castle secretly at night? I seem to have anticipated Your Highness' thoughts. The key to the courtyard entrance to the wine cellar. I, uh, borrowed it from His Grace's wine steward while we were singing, locked in brotherly embrace.[CHUCKLES] But he will miss it. He'll report it lost. Your Highness' have a tendency to underestimate me. This is a duplicate I contrived in the early hours of this morning. The wine steward's key will be found on the floor of the inn where he will think he dropped it. Good man. Your Highness flatters my small talents. Tonight, Your Highness? Tonight. You know now why I sent a courier to Your Excellency, with a contrived excuse, in the hope of delaying your coming. But when you arrived, I... I lacked the courage to tell you of this horror. I should never have permitted you to enter, no matter what the cost. It's better that I know the truth. You say you're aware of the nature of this monstrous thing? It is written in the record of judgments pronounced by Duke Francisco while he reigned. I need not recall to you the character of Eduardo's father. He was not a bad man in the true sense of the word. But he was harsh, imperious, exacting. He believed in his divine right to rule, and that all living things in this domain, together with the product of their labor, even their thoughts, belonged to him. Far different from Eduardo's way of thinking, perhaps because I had some small part in forming Eduardo's more liberal concepts from his earliest years. Orsini, please. The explanation. [SIGHS] It was reported to the Duke that the alchemist-sorcerer Scarlotti had discovered a way of transmuting base metals into pure gold. The Duke ordered the man brought before him and demanded that he reveal the secret. Scarlotti refused, saying that the knowledge was not meant for the enrichment of any one man, but belonged to all men. The Duke, in a rage, threatened Scarlotti with the rack, to torture the secret from him. Scarlotti had no fear of torture. And, in the end, the Duke commanded that he be entombed alive for his defiance. I can still see his burning eyes, hear his voice as he spoke to the Duke before he was taken away. "Because power and greed have made a beast of the Duke of Alleta, "I lay a curse upon his house. "For he who shall follow you upon this throne, "shall prowl by night in the manner and in the shape of a beast." And he was entombed alive? Yes, and because I protested, secretly from me. Probably in some remote dungeon within these walls. He was never seen alive again. And the masons who walled him in were sent out of the country. The secret of his end died with Duke Francisco. I will not believe there's nothing you can do, that there's no answer. Nor will I. For having seen him, I cannot think of the sorcerer as a completely evil man. He may have relented and in his tomb left some clue as to the removal of the curse. But we've not been able to find a trace of it. Go back to Sardi. Forget me. Could I forget you? Even with the whole world between us? Would it be so easy for you to forget me? Don't twist my meaning. If you were ill with a sickness of the flesh, and I fled from you as from a leper, without waiting to know whether you would recover, could I return to you? Would you want me back? Althea, if you are being moved by compassion or a sense of honor, I can't bear your pity. Not pity. Love. Don't try to deceive me or yourself. Now, right now, when I'm holding you, you're not seeing me. You are remembering the beast. It is in your eyes. You will never be able to look at me again without seeing the beast. Go. Go back to Sardi. ALTHEA: If you were ill with a sickness of the flesh, and I fled from you as from a leper, without waiting to know whether you would recover, could I return to you? Would you want me back? NARRATOR: With an ancient diagram of the intricate maze of passageways beneath the castle as their guide, Eduardo and Orsini continued their daily search for the tomb of Scarlotti, the sorcerer. This corridor is a branch off the main corridor to the wine cellar. This wall is as solid as the others. There's no hollow sound, no mark to show it has been breached or re-sealed. If Scarlotti's tomb is not in this wing of the castle, we are at the end. [TAPPING] [SOFTLY] Welcome to Castle Alleta, Your Highness. May I offer you a refreshment? [CHUCKLES] What a pity His Grace was not expecting you. It's the first time that I have ever been welcome down here. No, wait, listen. It sounds as if someone was tapping on the walls down here. [DISTANT TAPPING] In that direction. Yes. Yes, perhaps what we're searching for is down here. They seem to be searching for something hidden behind the walls. Wait. We may find out what they're searching for. Orsini, it is here. We've searched too long. The sun has set. I feel it coming over me. [GROANS] Eduardo, we've searched enough. No. Let's go back to the dungeon. It was like seeing the hand of the Devil reach out of the darkness and transform His Grace into a fiend. Devils? Fiends? You two probably stopped at the inn for a few measures, to whet your courage before venturing into the castle. What you thought you saw came from the bottom of a glass. On the contrary, my dear. If my memory serves me right, it came from the very imaginative art of a man I once knew... Scarlotti. And his black art. You talk in riddles. You've heard the old wives' tale concerning Scarlotti, the sorcerer? Of course. Ever since I was a child. I'm beginning to think the tale possesses more truth than fiction. You actually believe the curse Scarlotti put on the Duke Francisco? "He who shall follow after you upon this throne "shall prowl by night "in the manner and in the shape of a beast." He looked exactly that, a beast. And when did these mysterious nighttime closings of the castle begin? Immediately after the coronation of Duke Eduardo. Almost to the day. Well, perhaps your more enlightened mind can think of some other explanation for what has been happening, for what we have seen. No. To think that from his tomb, Scarlotti has given me the weapon that I have needed to rid myself of Eduardo. Hail, Duke of Alleta! Oh, you can't. The curse might fall upon you. Listen to Scarlotti's words again. "He who shall follow after you upon this throne." Eduardo followed after Francisco, not I. The curse was meant for him. None other. Their Highnesses, Prince Bruno and the Princess Sybil. Your Grace. Your Excellency. My Lady Althea. Perhaps Your Grace misunderstood my message? I requested a private audience. I have no secrets from my fiancee, from her father, nor from the Baron Orsini. I am a little surprised to find the Lady Althea still here. I see no reason why she should absent herself a few days before her wedding. I thought perhaps the wedding might be canceled. For the same reason Your Grace canceled the carnival. For which I am now sure he had a very good reason. You're wrong. My wedding to the Grace will not be canceled, nor postponed for any reason. It would make a very interesting union, indeed. An unholy alliance. Ah, now do not pretend offense, nephew. Or that you are unaware of my meaning. And what do you mean? Since I am the next in line, I'm here to demand His Grace's immediate abdication in my favor. Or I will expose his secret to the world. Why this castle is shrouded in darkness and mystery from sunset to sunrise. Why His Grace has never dared to show himself during those hours since the day of his coronation. I will make public what I know. That the curse of Scarlotti has fallen upon the son of Duke Francisco and that a creature out of the foul depths of hell has succeeded to the throne. You have no proof. You are the proof, Eduardo. The living proof. Do you dare put it to the test? And if I needed more proof, I see it written on her face. And what do you see written on my face, Your Highness? Except the desire to drive the point of this sword through your heart. Why, I only wish to do Your Excellency and the Lady Althea a kindness. And you, too, nephew. By permitting you to step aside quietly, without being driven out by your own people. As his trusted counselor, Orsini, you should urge him to submit to something that both of you must've known to be inevitable from the beginning. I do not know how you arrived at the truth, but you will never exploit it through me. You're fools, all of you, to lend him false hope. When I come again, it will not be in private. And you will be glad to flee this castle like a slinking beast. Go! Before I call down another curse upon my head for laying hands on you in violence! Your Grace. He feels the crown upon his head. NARRATOR: With Bruno's threats haunting Eduardo, the desperate effort to find Scarlotti's tomb began again. Searching in the still unexplored regions deep within the foundations of the castle, Eduardo and Orsini followed every possible clue, hoping to find evidence of the chamber that had been sealed many years before. Then, suddenly, there was faint hope. [HOLLOW KNOCKING] When I heard the hollow sound beyond the wall, I wanted to tear the stones away with my bare hands. Oh, how I'm praying that we find it, and that it holds all we seek. These stones are free now, Your Grace. We can remove them. EDUARDO: Remove them, Mario. Quickly. [GRUNTS] Shall I squeeze through? See what's on the other side? Uh, no. I want to discover that for myself. Thank you, Mario. You may go now. That is all. Thank you. In another moment, we shall know. ORSINI: Eduardo, what is it? What have you found? It must be Scarlotti. ORSINI: It could be no one but Scarlotti. These are the very garments he wore when he appeared before Duke Francisco. No scrap of paper. No sign of what I'd hoped to find. There must be! Let's search everywhere. ORSINI: Here. On the wall. [ORSINI READING] He was not a creature of evil, he did leave a clue. Words. What do they mean? The words seem clear to me. Even if Scarlotti did leave them as a riddle to be solved. Love is the clue. The love of a woman, a love so great that she would not fear to give herself in marriage to the beast he created. Because I've never feared to marry you. My love for you has never wavered. I'm so happy for you. For us. Let's be married immediately, without waiting for the announced date. I'm ready now. Then prepare a proclamation, Orsini. Tomorrow is decreed the wedding date of His Grace, the Duke of Alleta. I shall never have written one with a lighter heart. Give him a decent burial, Orsini. And then, after we took the first two stones from the wall, Duke Eduardo, for some reason, sent us home. You didn't see what was behind the wall? No, Highness. It was all darkness there. That must be the wall we watched them sounding just before the... Did they say anything that would explain why they were so anxious to find out what was behind the wall? Nothing I could make head or tail of, but they were so happy and eager, you might think they expected to find a hidden treasure of gold. Grimaldi, you did well to bring him to me at once. I thought you'd be as interested in his story as I was at the inn. You may go now.Thanks, Your Highness. Why should they show such a sudden happiness, when they should feel just the opposite? Yes. What did they expect to find behind that wall? I must know. And tonight. A skeleton. It's a tomb. Scarlotti. He always wore garments like these. This is why he was never seen alive, from the day he appeared before Duke Francisco. What were Eduardo and Orsini searching for in a tomb? Your Highness! "Power and glory and greed..." [READING] [CONTINUES READING] Scarlotti. This is what they were searching for. This is why they dared defy me, when I flung the truth in their faces. If any man knows the secret of Scarlotti's end, it is Orsini. He hoped to find this tomb, and in it, some clue that might lead to Eduardo's release from the curse. A woman's hand shall hold the key? Scarlotti's last taunt. Even he could not conceive of any woman who could bring herself to love the beast that he had created. But then he did not know about the Lady Althea. She could be the woman? Well, she knows that Eduardo is accursed, and yet, she refuses to postpone her marriage to him. She could well be the woman. And it could explain the rumors you heard this evening. That Eduardo had advanced the date of his wedding to tomorrow. Ah, but these rumors will prove to be wrong. For I will make sure tonight, that there will be no marriage. Not with the Lady Althea. [SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] Child! Child! Althea, child. Stand guard over him. What is it? The sound of a struggle awakened me. And you... You were gone. Bruno and Grimaldi, they tried to kill Althea. Let me loose. With your wedding tomorrow, you dare not show yourself like this tonight. People are still about. At the inn, in the byways... Orsini, this cannot go unpunished. Eduardo, it is more important that we know what prompted this attack on Lady Althea. ORSINI: Look! Their feet damp with the night dew left these imprints in the dust. Somehow they obtained a key. Come quickly. Eduardo, come. Now we know why he tried to remove the Lady Althea. Somehow he learned the secret of Scarlotti's end, came here, saw this, and reasoned the true meaning of the riddle. As we did. That her love for you, her woman's hand, held the secret of the lifting of the curse. He will not harm her. For tomorrow he will be in chains. Tomorrow will be too late. Bruno knows at this minute that it's life or death for him. And to live, he must overthrow you, destroy you before the sun rises. Marry her tonight. Within the hour. Father Amero's known you all the days of your life. We can risk the short drive to the church. When we tell him of Scarlotti's curse upon you, he will understand. He will want to help you. To free you from it. [PATRONS CHATTERING] Silence. Silence. Listen to me. For weeks now you've whispered amongst yourselves concerning the mystery of Duke Eduardo's castle, and why it has lain dark during the night hours like the mouth of hell. I will tell you, all of you, what I have told them, your friends and neighbors. That the castle has become the lair of a beast. Half man, half animal, spawned out of the devilish obscenities of witchcraft and sorcery. A beast with fangs for teeth, with claws for hands. His head and his body matted with the hair of an animal. His red eyes glaring in the fury of his blood lust. I have seen this beast, not an hour ago, within the castle, his talons clutched at my throat, and his fetid breath panted in my face. It is a beast that stalks by night. You, Spaldi. Your first born lies wasting away with a fever for which you have found no cure. And there will be no cure for her, and all of you will fall victims to the same devilish incantation, unless we purge ourselves of this thing harbored within the castle. I will kill this beast! Let us kill the beast! And I will lead you. Now. This very moment. To hunt him down, to drag him out of his den. To send this beast back to his master, Satan. Follow me, then, and arm yourselves as we go. [ALL CLAMORING] Are you ready, child?Yes. It won't be the glittering state wedding we'd planned. Father, if it means happiness for him, for us, I'd marry him in a hovel, with a wedding gown of sack cloth. Hurry, then. [ALL CLAMORING] Stop! There's the Duke's carriage coming from the castle. Stop it. [ALL YELLING] Orsini, what is it? The shouting? These torches? It's Bruno. At the head of a mob. He's incited the people to violence. RODERICK: Is there no other way? They're coming toward us. We will escape them, if we reach the fork in the road before they do. Turn back. Turn back. It's too late. The only way we can escape them is to keep going. Open the doors. Let us see who flees the castle so fast at this time of night. Drag them out. [ALL GASP] Behold the beast. The monster of the castle. Yes, you may well look upon him in horror. See who else tried to escape with him. Whatever your hatred has brought upon me, spare her. Ah, this thing whines of mercy. Let's hear him bark. He'll sit up and beg before we get rid of him. [ALL LAUGHING] In spite of what I look to be, I am Eduardo, your ruler. He is Eduardo, your ruler. Can you imagine him, that, with a crown on his head, sitting in judgment over you? [ALL LAUGHING] I am guilty of nothing but the desire to save you from his ambition to rule in my place. His place? His place is in a cage with other foul beasts. [ALL LAUGHING] Hear me! I did try to hide the truth from you. That a curse had transformed me into this, a beast by night. I had hoped to find a release from it before my secret became known to you. Have you forgotten that the bands have been published? That he intended tomorrow to be his wedding day? Look at her and look at him. The beauty and the beast. Would that not make a lovely wedding? [ALL LAUGHING] He lies. He is what he looks to be. A beast, who cast his black spell on my child. Kill him and stop this evil. ALL: Yeah! Wait! Do you not know that the hellborn do not die like humankind? They rise from their graves again. There is only one sure purge for evil. The flame! By burning! [ALL CHEERING] ALL: Burn, burn, burn. Is that your judgment? ALL: Yeah! Then gather wood to feed the flame. [ALL CHEERING] MAN: The flame.ALL: Yeah. ALL: Burn! Burn! Let it be done. Althea, go back. If she wants to die with him, let her. The mark of the beast is on her, too. Put them both in the torches. Wait! At least listen to me. If you believe in his lies, you do murder for him. But the evil you should fear is in his heart, not in this man he seeks to destroy. What he told you of the spell cast over him was truth. He does not deserve your hate, but your prayers, your compassion and your love for all he has suffered innocently. Love! She asks us to love that. [ALL LAUGHING] Yes, love that, for an ugly face can mask the goodness hidden in one's soul. I know now the meaning of the words I saw written on the walls of the sorcerer's tomb. "Till out of love with soul, fear free, "a woman's hand shall hold the key." Scarlotti knew that... That unless it's strong enough to triumph over all else, over fear, over pride, even over death, love, even marriage, are only empty words. If you burn him, then burn me with him. Or I shall not live. Eduardo. I feel it. Within me. That I am free. Deliverance. It is still night, but the beast is gone. There is no escape for you, Bruno. Here and now, I banish you from Alleta forever, and Grimaldi with you. Yes, look at me. See that I am Eduardo. A man of flesh and blood. A man who has been made whole again through the love of a woman. This woman, who shall sit by my side for as long as I live and rule over you, who will help me to be worthy of your love, and to govern with justice and mercy and understanding. Go in peace. The long dark night has ended. Forever. [ALL CHEERING]
