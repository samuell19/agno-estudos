(dramatic music) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (woman moaning) (somber beat music) - Sit. Something, anything, either one of those things. To us. (giggling) (moaning) God. You are beautiful. You and I, we're gonna be something very special. We're gonna do something very special. (somber beat music) You are very, very special to me. You have something I want. And now, I have something you need. I want a closer experience. (sensual beat music) Such nice eyes. A touch of evil. When I get through with you. (moaning) (giggling) (sexual moaning) (man groaning) (thudding) What the fuck?! Get the fuck off me! What have you done to me? Leave me! You bastard! (suspenseful music) Get back! Get the fuck back! Get back! You ruined it! You ruined everything! Why would you hurt me? I've always, always appreciated your affections. I just wanted you to get mine. That's all. (thudding) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (metal rattling) (banging) (gates rattling) (yelling) (suspenseful music) (alarm sounding) (woman yelling) (screaming) It's too late. - You're finished. (metal clanking) (ominous music) - Fucking amateur. (pleasant music) (birds chirping) - How you doing, Pearl? - Doing fine, Trent. Just fine. So you all alone out here? - No. Your dad's inside with a customer. - Oh, which one? - I didn't ask him his name. - Oh, don't worry. By this time next month, you'll know them all on sight. - I'm sure I will. Whoa! - Oh, I'm sorry. - It's okay. - So how's the hotel? - It's fine, I guess. I mean, what do you expect from a room? - I'm sure dad could help you find a place, I figure for a lot less than you pay for just a room. - I'm sure he can. - Hey, sugar. - Hey, Ruby. - He prefers Trent. - How you doing? You're kinda early, aren't you? - I'm not staying long. Mom's new husband wants me to serve a little time in the store, but I have better things to do with my time. You know how that is, Trent. - Well, I gotta stay late. Past closing. Maybe later. - Why, Sugar, you horrible tease. You working all night? I guess I'll just have to find someone else to occupy my time with. It's a pity. Oh, bye the way. - Yeah, Ruby? - I couldn't help but notice you're already worked up. - Yeah? - Be a dear and bring in some wood. We're almost out. - Oh, Pearl. I'm sorry, where were we? - How come you let her call you sugar? You prefer Trent, don't you? - Come on, you two. This ain't no social club. I'm paying you by the hour, so let's get busy, okay? - Got it. - As for you, Pearl, today's the first day Ruby's gotten into work before you in the morning. I'd hate to see you make a habit of coming in later than her. (engine puttering) (birds chirping) - He's got your doing the shit work, huh? - It's not bad. Pays the bills. - Pretty girls you're being forced to work with. - They're all right. - I bet you stop and wipe your brow every time one of them comes around just so you can wink at their pretty little asses. Don't you? I hear you're pretty good with bad engine noises? - I've turned a bolt or two in my time. - Do you mind taking a look? I'm running a bit ragged. I hope you can get it working by nightfall because I got a hot date with Ruby tonight. (engine rumbling) You hear that noise? I'm sure it's a point to the valves. I'd fix it myself but I don't have the time. - There's no such thing as points in an electronic striper and you wouldn't know it was a valve unless you had a solid lifter can. - What was the problem? - A spark plug wire came loose. (birds chirping) (engine rumbling) (ominous music) (groaning) (ominous music) (gagging) (moaning) (ominous music) (groaning) - Woo! Damn! (moaning) Here you go, sir. (suspenseful music) - Hey, buddy. How you doing? - Do I know you? - I don't know. Do you? - Oh, I think I'd remember that. - Well, you know memories aren't always what we recall. - You should remember, Trent. He's you and who you could have been. And everything you're not. - I thought you were dead. (laughing) - Timing has never been your strong suit. Has it, Trent? (laughing) - Timing is everything, isn't it baby? - Oh, it absolutely is. - Wasn't quite a full moon yet, was it? - No it wasn't. But one's coming up. - Tomorrow night. - Well, it is nice to see you finally paying attention. - I don't really seem to have much choice, do I? - I guess not. And it's such, such a pity. - I can take care of myself. - That's just what we're afraid of. - So that's why you're up here. - No. We just came up for a change of pace. Change of scenery. Wild game. - Hey, look, it's been a pleasure, but I gotta go. - Hi, y'all. - Hi. - Trent? - Angus. - So where you strangers from? - We're from Texas. - That's great. Up here for opening day? - Ah huh. - Sure. Hunting season. - Angus, can I help you with something inside? - Oh, I just was... Well, I better skedaddle on out of here. Nice meeting y'all. Happy hunting. Okay, I'll see you. - Toodaloo! - Look, I never meant to hurt you, all right? - Sure you did. You loved hurting me. - Not as much as I'm gonna enjoy hurting you. - Don't get your panties in a twirl, big boy. - Excuse me? Are you two more interested in each other than you are me? - Yeah. - Well, Trent, I was hoping you would join us. Join our little-- - Pack? Not interested. You're howling up the wrong tree, honey. (giggling) - You don't have much of a choice now, do you? - Oh, I do. - You're still such an innocent child. Let me ask you, are you still afraid of the big, bad wolf, little boy? (laughing) - Not really. Well, it's been a real pleasure. Glad you guys could stop by. - It's always a pleasure. - Don't come back too soon. - Oh my, what a gracious host. - Isn't he? - Trent, dad needs your help out back. - I'll be right in. - Yum. Sweet. Very sweet. I'll see you at moonrise, Trent. Let's go, baby. (laughing) - What a weird bunch. - Hey, Pearl. Hey, Ruby, sweetheart. We still on for tonight? Everything still okay? - Yeah, sure, Angus. Everything's fine. - You know, there's a new Bruce Willis picture playing at the multiplex tonight. - Sounds exciting. - Pick you up about eight o'clock out front? Is that okay? I'll even bring some beer for later, so we can go to the point and watch the moon come up. - Nah. I've got a better idea. Why don't you come around four. - Alrighty then. I'll see you at four. - My knight in shining armor. - Sounds like a good time. A movie and a six-pack. - Who said anything about a movie? Of course, I could be home all night on a Friday doing my homework and watching TV. But I guess I'll have to make do with a man who's hung like a horse and a couple of ice cold beers to wash it down with. - Ew. (giggling) - You've got Angus. Why do you have to pick on Trent? - He doesn't seem to be complaining that I've noticed. - It's just it's not nice. Ever since he showed up last week. Why do you have to do it? - I do it, Pearly White, because I can. I can do it to your precious Trent. I can do it to Angus. I can do it to anybody I want. - Could you just cut Trent a little slack? At least finish with Angus before you move on to the next one. - I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, Pearl. Come here. Angus is a nice guy in a simple sort of way and God knows he is hung where it counts. But I was finished with him before I ever got started. The same thing goes for your Trent. I might throw him a ticket to paradise and I might not. But as long as I have to be around all these farm boys, I'm gonna have a little fun as queen of the ball. And if these boys don't like it, they don't have to play. So far, they don't seem to be running away. - Come on, Ruby. Give me a break. - I would love to, but how about bite instead? (sensual beat music) (moaning) - Pearl, what're we doing here? I want some... I don't know. - What? - Well don't you want something else? Something more? - What? - You don't understand, do you? - Stop it. What's there to understand? - Nevermind. Come here. - Come on. - [Father] Not a bad day, all in all. - You know I ain't here for my time. - Bye the way, Pearl, I need you to set up those coffee pots in the morning. - Dad, that's Ruby's job. - Yeah, well, Ruby's not here. They gotta be ready to go by the time we open tomorrow. - Ruby's never here. - Now Pearl, you know that's not true. Your sis-- - She's not my sister. - Your step-sister has a date tonight. - She always has a date. - Now don't you worry, Pearl. Before long it'll be your turn. - Dad. - [Father] Ruby, where you all going? - Going on a field trip, Buck. - Now that I'm married to your mother, I wish you'd call me dad. - Come on, Buck, I only call my real dad that. - Hey Ruby, you ready to go? - Yeah. I'll be ready in a minute. - You like her, don't you? - Huh? - Look, I'm not no idiot. - I never said you were, Angus. - I'm gonna be watching you, boy. - Boy? - I don't take well to strangers. - Hi, Ruby. - Hey. - So, are you ready to get out of here? - Maybe. Maybe not. I have a date. Gotta go get ready. - Happy hunting. (engine rumbling) - We ready to go, Ruby? - Did you bring everything I told you to? - Yep. Got it all right here. - Flashlight? - Check. - Cuffs? - It's in the pack. - Rope? - I promise, I got everything you said to bring and it's all in the pack. I even made a list. - Collar and leash? Once we get started, there's no turning back. - Ruby, I promise you. I got everything you said to bring and then some. Look, I want this to be our best date ever. - This isn't a date. - Well, I didn't mean it like that. - Look, Angus, you been bugging me for weeks and I do mean, bugging me. So, this isn't about playing hard to get. - Well, I'm fine with that as long as you are. (ominous music) How we doing? Making any progress? - Listen. Do you hear that? - What? - It's a highway, Angus. We're just getting started. (ominous music) Hey! Slow down, cowboy. We still got a long way to go. - Why? - You see a well around here? - A whale? Here? - Or a faucet or a stream? Weren't you a boy scout? Daddy never took you camping? - Well, he took me camping. (shushing) What? - Nothing. Hey, I warned you. - Come on, I've got plenty. - Well don't even ask cause you're not getting any of mine. Come on. Let's go this way. (eerie music) This way. (ominous music) - [Angus] Hey, wait up, will you? - What? You need a rest again? - What's the problem, anyway? How is it I'm such a horrible guy? - I suppose it's from years of experience. - Come on, that's not fair. I'm a nice guy. - Yeah? Nice guys finish last. - Then what're we doing out here then? - It's more, I guess you could say, a religious experience. - What, like a retreat? - Something like that. - I brought condoms for this? (ominous music) - This is it! - Thank God. I thought we'd never get here. So this is what we've been looking for? - It is. It is. - A storm drain? - No, silly. It's the tunnel of love. And there's a secret to this place. Legend has it, that Willie Vasquez hid out with his mistress and the money he stole from the bank robbery. You know, the old First National line? And when their getaway car broke down, they hid in this old storm drain. That night there was a flash flood and they both were killed. And the cops found his body in the ravine in the morning, but they didn't never find hers. And legend has it that Willie still rides through here looking for his mistress. - Well then what the fuck are we doing here? I don't need to meet any damn ghosts. - Because legend has it that if you crawl in the storm drain and make love, you'll see visions when you orgasm. - Visions, huh? - That's right, Angus. A vision. - Let's go. (laughing) (foreboding beat music) (wolf howling) - Must be the bandit followed us. - Must be. - It's a beautiful moon out tonight, isn't it? - Yeah, it's a moon all right. (crickets chirping) - You know, Ruby, I'm not blind. - Yeah? - I see the way guys look at you. - And how do they look at me? - The way you looked at me the first time. Like Trent. - He must be getting closer. - What? - Nothing. So what about Trent? - He's a nice guy, I guess. I mean, he's new in town and all, but... - But what? - You know he's a drifter. I mean, not in a bad way. I mean, he's probably not even gonna be around here after the summer's over. He'll just keep drifting. - He's not tied down. - That's what I mean. No roots. I mean, hell, first cold wind comes along, he'll be out of here on the same rail that brought him into town. Not like me, for instance. - Not like you. - Yeah, I'm here. Permanently. One of these days I'll have a ranch. Not a big one. Not at first. But it will be. A place where people can live and raise a family. You know, permanently. - You're a sweet man, Angus. - I see the way you look at other guys and I just-- - Relax, Angus. I'm here. - Yeah, but it's-- - Angus. You see the way they all look at me. And I could be anywhere tonight. With any one of them. But I'm here. With you. Tonight it's just the two of us. (ominous music) (wolf howling) (menacing music) - [Woman] No! (woman screaming) - Pearl, you seen Ruby today? - No, dad, I was in class all day. Why, she never showed up? - No. No one's seen her all day either. - Wasn't she out with Angus last night? - Yes she was. - Well. - That's the problem. No one's seen Angus today either. - That's what I meant. - But Angus woulda called. He didn't show up for work this morning. Didn't call saying he wasn't coming in. His dad's worried half sick. He even went to the sheriff. Officially, they won't do anything for 24 hours. - Maybe they eloped. - With him? Yeah, I doubt that. I'm sure they're out there together. He seems to be about Ruby's speed. - Yeah. (giggling) She's a popular girl. - Here, get busy. I better head on out and help Angus' dad and start looking for him. Only a few hours of daylight left. And Pearl, if Ruby does show up, nail her shoes to the floor. (ominous music) (footsteps stomping) (eerie music) (crickets chirping) (men talking) - I know, she's a hand full. Got an APB on that truck in four other states. Rumor has it she wanted someone to take her on out of here. - I doubt she'd go that far with an idiot like Angus. - Buck, his dad's only 50 yards back. - He aint no brain surgeon neither. I tell you, Rodeen's half-crazy over this. Can't believe he done taken her home. - I'm sure Rodeen's got plenty of experience handling Ruby. - You have no idea. (ominous music) - Boo. Nice day for a hike. - Why don't you take one? Smokey says, "It's a little dry for smoking." - Well, rules are meant to be broken. - Who follows rules anyway? - Well, you sure don't, do you? - No, I make my own. - You make your own? That's just what we're hoping for. - Hope springs eternal. (sniffing) (chuckling) - Eternity. Isn't that a cologne? - A perfume. Cologne is for men. - I like men. - Look, cut the cliches, all right? - Fine, I'm all business. - She's gotta love you. - She does. But you're the one she needs. - Come again? - You killed the big, bad wolf. Now you have the seed. - What the fuck are you talking about? - When you stake my father, you stole my birth right. Now you gotta to give her a son. You give her a son and we live forever. You don't and we die and you go first. - You seem like a nice enough guy in a Gucci sort of way. I came out here to get away from that shit. I don't run with the pack. - You don't run with the pack? - No. - That's not what I heard. - I didn't fucking kill him. - You didn't? How do you know? (ominous music) What do you really know about who you are? - I know enough to know what I don't need and what I don't need in this fucking life is you. - In this life? In this life, you don't know shit. (foreboding music) (thudding) - You know, Trent, I'm sure dad can work out some kind of employee discount if you really need those. - I was gonna pay for these, Pearl. I knew you already chased out so I thought I'd just-- - And there's something missing from the tap room too. What's gonna be next? - Pearl, I'm not a thief. I was just borrowing these. I was gonna have them back on the shelf tomorrow. I didn't think anyone was gonna notice. - Yeah right. - Pearl? - Yeah? - Don't scare me like that, Pearl. - Like what? - I just came from the story, the door's wide open, the cash register's hanging open. Not a soul in sight, that's like what. - [Radio Officer] Hey, Shorty is beating his wife again. How do you want us to handle that? - Yeah, Dick, got ahead and send a car over to pick him up. Hose him down and set him loose in the morning. - [Dick] Copy that. - Everything okay out here? - Yes, it's fine. No sign of Ruby I take it. - No. She never showed, never called. - Both she and Angus seem to just vanished. They went to the movies last night and no one's seen them since. - Maybe they didn't go. - Maybe. - Look, I'm sure they're okay. They're just out, you know? - You're right, honey, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. - Everything's locked up in back. - Okay. - Sheriff. - Look, I'm gonna go with your dad and look some more tonight. First I'm gonna stop by your house and speak with Ruby's mother. - Okay. - Yeah, Dick, I've got a 10-20. Going to Rodeen's house. - [Dick] Copy that. Mind picking up some jelly donuts for Janine while you're on your way? - You got it. (ominous music) (huffing) (suspenseful music) (animal growling) (foreboding music) (animals snarling) (wolf howling) (groaning) (yelling) (wolf howling) (unsettling music) (somber music) - Shit. How'd you? You gotta go! - I followed you. - Pearl, you have got to go now. - Trent, what the hell are you doing? - Nothing you could vaguely understand. - Look, I'm not going anywhere unless you tell me exactly what's going on. - It's ridiculous. You wouldn't believe me if I told you. - Try me. - Tonight I'll be a bad boy. I'll be out of control and I will hurt people. - Why? - There's gonna be a full moon again tonight, Pearl. - I don't follow you. - I'm a werewolf. (laughing) - What? - Leave me alone and I'll see you tomorrow. - Trent, you're making no sense! - I told you, Pearl! - Okay, okay. What happens? - I don't remember. That's the problem, I can't remember. I tried to fight it down last night, but I didn't have enough time. What I heard about Ruby this morning. As long as there's a full moon and unless I take an innocent, I will keep on changing and here's not a damn fucking thing I can do about it! - Ruby? - Possibly. - What do you mean, possibly? Have you done something to her?! To Angus?! Where are they?! What have you done to them?! - I told you, I don't remember, Pearl! - Yeah. Yeah. Ruby's just out somewhere, with Angus, sewing her wild oats or something. Whatever the hell that means. You are not a monster and when the moon comes up, you'll be just fine. What you need is a doctor. Some kind of therapy to get you through this delusion that you're a-- (yelling) - Oh God! - Trent! Trent! Trent! (yelling) - Run! (growling) (ominous music) (eerie music) (howling) (yelling) (growling) (unsettling music) - Dick, I need an ID on this vehicle. I got a David Paul 4-4-2. - [Dick] Copy that. - [Buck] This is Angus' truck, I'm sure of it. He was driving it the other night. He picked up Ruby with it. - [Dick] I've got a positive ID on that. It's Angus'. - [Sheriff] Yeah, Dick, why don't you tell Annie put a pot of coffee on. Looks like it's gonna be a long night. - [Dick] Copy that. - It doesn't look good, Buck. There's blood on the window here. The door too. - [Buck] There's blood over here. A lot of it. (ominous music) - All right, everybody, keep your eyes open and spread out. - Oh my God! - Looks like some kind of animal attack. Maybe a bear. Or a wolf. - No wolf did this. - It's been out here about 36 hours. No telling at all what's been at it since then. - Where's Ruby? - Sorry Buck, look, there's no need for you to see any more of this. Why don't you go on home? Go back into town. I'll radio in and have somebody take his body. - Trent, the new kid at the store, he didn't come in until late in the afternoon. - Look, Buck, this is an animal attack. He aint gonna be responsible. There's no way a human being did this. - Trent, he walked home from the store late last night. I saw him cutting through the woods. He didn't fill show up to work today. - We'll check out his place when we get back into town. - Yeah, okay. (ominous music) - Yeah, Dick, why don't you send in forensics. I've got a half-eaten torso and blood all over the place. (police siren alarming) (monster growling) - Trent? Trent, are you here? - Hey. I didn't hear you. Ugh. - Did you go anywhere last night? - No. - You look normal. - I've been fighting it down all night. - I have some bad news for you. - What? - They haven't found her yet. - Ruby? What about Angus? - Slaughtered. (eerie music) (Pearl sobbing) (thudding) - This isn't happening! - Trent, it's not your fault. You don't even remember doing it. Who knows if it's even you? - Yeah, that's right. Tell that to your dad. - Look, I've got a plan. - Hey, Pearl, you shouldn't be doing any of this. This could get a lot worse before it gets better. When they start looking for me-- - No one's looking for you. At least, not like that. They think you might be a victim of the animal that killed Ruby and Angus. - That's not far from the truth. - What we're gonna do is, tonight, I'm gonna take pictures of you. I'm gonna show that you never leave the chain. Then, you're gonna take a life. An innocent life. - A rabbit? Come on. - It's as innocent as I could find. - Come on, Pearl! A rabbit? Pictures? This is insane. - Look, Trent, with me on your side, you can get some help. A doctor, therapy. It's not like they burn people at the stake anymore. - That's it. That's it! You were right! - What? - In my room, behind the door, there's a bag. - A bag? What about the rabbit? - Fuck the rabbit! Go get the bag and do it now! Hurry! Go! (ominous music) (car door slamming) - [Dick] Gus, isn't that Angus's truck over there? - [Gus] Looks like it to me. - [Dick] Irma, this is Dale. Why don't you brew up a pot of coffee? Looks like we may want that. - [Gus] Shit fire. Dick, you better get on over here. There's some blood. - [Dick] There's some here too. - [Gus] Where? - [Dick] Right in here. - [Gus] Where's that damn local sheriff? Him and that idiot, Buck, were supposed to come out here looking for them and we haven't heard tell of them since. - [Dick] Right in here. - [Gus] Where's that damn local sheriff? Him and that idiot, Buck, were supposed to come out here looking for them and we haven't heard tell of them since. - [Dick] Gus! Look over here! - [Gus] What do you got, Dick? - [Dick] I've got an arm. - [Gus] An arm? - [Dick] Irma, this looks like some sort of animals attack. I'm gonna need some backup over here. Gus, you kill me. - [Gus] What's that, Dick? - [Dick] Oh my God! - [Gus] What do you got? What do you got? (ominous music) Shit! Shit! (Gus groaning) (Gus vomiting) - [Dick] We're gonna need to seal off the area. (Gus vomiting) You all right, Gus? - [Gus] I say get the fuck out of here. Get back to base. (ominous music) (unsettling music) - That sheriff was good. (laughing) - Before you got a hold of them. Mmmm, yes. You are so beautiful. - Yes you are. (Ruby whimpering) - I have been waiting and wanting you for such a long time. (Ruby yelling) Did you know that? - Yes. - Don't you want it? You can have her. And she wants to be one of us. Do you want to join us? - Yes. Yes. - I can't hear you! - Yes! (Ruby whimpering) - Are you sure? - Yes! - Then you take her. (unsettling chanting music) (Ruby screaming) (unsettling chanting music) It's time to end this life and begin another! (laughing) (Ruby moaning) (unsettling chanting music) - Ruby! Stop! (screaming) (unsettling chanting music) (crickets chirping) (laughing) - Bye. (laughing) Trent? I know where you are, Trent. Trent? Trent? (laughing) I know where you are, Trent. I know where you are, Trent. (ominous music) (somber music) - Trent! Trent! - What? What's the matter? - Oh my god. - What? - They killed them. They killed everyone. - Who? - They're all dead. My father, Angus, the sheriff, everybody. I watched them kill Ruby and I didn't even do anything to help her, I was so scared. (sobbing) - Did anyone follow you here? - No. - Are you sure? This is really important, Pearl. - Yeah. Wait a minute. - What? - This means you didn't kill anybody. - Well just because I didn't kill Angus or Ruby doesn't mean I haven't killed before. (sighing) - What're we gonna do? - They probably won't be back tonight. They've already had their kill. Tomorrow, when they're hungry again. - Oh, Ruby. I let her down. - No. There's nothing you could've done. They would have killed you too. - It's just-- (shushing) - You'll be fine. You'll be fine, Pearl. (ominous music) (crickets chirping) (camera clicking) - Hey! No fair. Those pictures are for you. - Come on, let me see. - Give me back the camera. - Okay. - I need it to document. (somber beat music) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (sexual moaning) (laughing) (moaning) (growling) - You like that? Here! Have another! (yelling) (foreboding music) - I forgot what a really good fuck you were, Trent. (Pearl whimpering) That wasn't very nice, Trent. I'm really gonna miss him. - Say cheese, bitch! (camera clicking) (screaming) (growling) (eerie music) Leave him alone! (screaming) (ominous music) - I'm sorry. - You loved her, didn't you? - She was my wife. - What? - It was over. A year ago. - Oh my god. I killed her. - You had no choice. - What're we gonna do? (ominous music) (screaming) No! - You have to kill me. (dramatic music) (groaning) Do it! - No, Trent, I can't. I love you! - Then set me free. Do it! Do it now, before it's too late! - I love you! - Do it! (screaming) (groaning) (sobbing) (dramatic music) (Pearl crying) - No! - Hi, Pearl. (screaming) (laughing) (eerie music) - No! (suspenseful beat music) - You're finished! - This way. (laughing) - Bye. (suspenseful beat music) - Yeah, Dick, why don't you get a car and pick him up. - [Dick] Copy that. - And Pearl, if Ruby does show up, nail her shoes to the floor. - You gotta pick it up from there? (groaning) (suspenseful beat music)
