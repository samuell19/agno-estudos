A movie by Girry Pratama, Tora Sudiro Boarding House Bu Cin Get it! Chicken, chicken. What chicken? Hey, Sigit. Is it true that you can see ghosts? Yeah. Why? Can you communicate with them too? No, I can't. I can see them only. But please don't tell us when you see them. It will freak us out. Don't they freak you out too? Yes, at first. Then when I was in middle school, I got used to seeing them. - Are you staring at me? - No, I'm not. - But you're crushing that poor kuntilanak. - What kuntilanak? But if you have the gift, why don't you become a TV star? - You can get lots of money. - I did. I was a ghost painter. But... Good evening. Welcome back to "Ih Serem" show. Tonight, I'm in an old abandoned warehouse. It's a building from Dutch Colonial era. It's so old, even the walls have wrinkles. Not funny? Without further ado, I'm gonna paint the first ghost that appears before me. Let me focus on their energy. - Done. - Is it done? What is this crap? It's just like a pre-schooler's doodle. It's the painting of that ghost. No, it's not. Stop shooting, let's go home. But I swear it's the painting of that ghost. You're a lousy artist. Do I look abstract to you? Hang in there, man. Why did you ride your bike like that with an old lady riding behind you? - Here's your money. - Thanks. Where's your manner? It's "Thank you, Ma'am!" People nowadays don't have manners. Why are you crawling on that window? Do you think you're a gecko? No, I'm just looking at myself in the mirror. Pay the rent. When are you gonna pay me? I don't do promises. When? I will, Ma'am. I will definitely pay the rent. Right after I get the money. - Tell me when. - I have some photo shoots today. Once I get the money, I will pass it on to you. Promises, promises. Do you still want to live here or not? Because if you don't, I have someone who does. Of course I still want to live here, and please don't kick me out. Just let me go to work, and I'll bring you the money. - Miss Cin. - Yes, Victor? I paid the rent yesterday through ATM to your BCL Bank account. I believe whatever you say. Because I love you. - You're just being kind. - Oh, stop it. You're the opposite of him. What? Stop smiling. - Then, excuse me. - Where do you think you're going? - Work? - But you haven't paid the rent. - I'm going out to get your money. - Let's go, then. - Why am I walking with you? - You held my arm. - Where am I going? - I don't care. Sigit! - Do you know where I'm supposed to go? - Inside, Ma'am. You're right, good looking. - Stand closer. - Great. Hold that pose. - Is this okay? - Sure! The lady, lift your butts. The guy, give me scary look. Cheek to cheek. Hold her. Perfect. Sigit... - What are you doing there? - But we agreed to use this spot. - Yeah, we like the background. - No, I mean... Of course, it's a good spot. Sorry for the distraction. That's a perfect spot. Hold that pose. Smile! Okay, great. Hey, leave! I mean... The sky! The cloud. It's cloudy now. - Begone! Shoo! - We want the photos to be perfect. Great. Wardrobe malfunction. Are you all right? - We want to change costumes. Let's go. - Sure. - How about the payment? - Is it okay if we transfer the money? Sure. - Thank you. - Yeah, thanks. Can I take a nap at your place after this? You always sleep until it's dark. Finally, we're home. I'm beat. Whose bra is that? Since you won't find any girl in here, then it's mine! Gross. Nap time for me. If I lay down next to you, don't you dare touch me. I won't do that. What if I got pregnant? And then you leave me. Help! Help! Help! Don't be alarmed. My name is Ningsih. I was the woman who got hit by a car tonight... and you helped me. Wait, I thought the woman who got hit was much older than you. I know, you're her daughter. You come here to avenge her death. I swear, it wasn't me. That woman was me. Want a proof? Your choice. You want that girl, or this woman? I choose that girl, she looks more of my age. Don't insult me. Can I come in? A ghost usually just walks through the walls or doors. You're the first ghost asking permission to enter my room. And I didn't save you either. If I did, you'd still alive now. How are you? Fine? How are you? Still dead? I mean, how do you feel now? And how come we can communicate with each other? I remember right before my death, I was staring at you. Maybe that's the reason we can communicate with each other. And what do you want from me now? No wonder I keep smelling a new ghost smell. And look who's here. You smells good. I'm Ningsih. I'm Toto, and this half creature is Michael. You mean half a ton? - Michael. - Ningsih. You can talk to them? Yes, can't you? You can talk to him? Yes. Who's the one with bunches? Ask him why he's haunting me? What did I do to him? He's asking you, why are you haunting him? Tell the tall muscular man, don't play the music too loud. It triggers my latah. - Show them. - Like this. - Show them! - Like this! Show them! He hates it when you play the music too loud. It triggers his latah. Tell him I'm sorry. It won't happen again. He said sorry. Tell him, he's forgiven. You're forgiven. Great. Thanks. - Where do you think you're going? - To your room? Why don't you stay here and chat with them? Get to know each other? I need to sleep. Fine. Dude. Who were you talking to? - There's a new ghost. - A new ghost? I know your M.O. You're stinky. Mike, how did you die? I killed myself. Goodbye, Tot. But come to think of it, I regret killing myself. Because she doesn't love me as much as I love her. On my funeral, when the guests are praying... she did an open mic. - She used me in one of her jokes. - I'm so sorry. Tot. How did you die? Goodbye too! Are you happy now? You died because of your latah? How tragic. Yeah, he's the drama drag queen. Shut up! I blame you for my death! But now that you're dead, you've become a super ghost. You can possess someone's body. - Really? - Yeah. - Hey, Tot. - Yes? Someone's coming! Victor! With him, I want to be inside him forever. I want to eject something on him. What's wrong, baby? What's wrong? Oh, my God! Oh, my no! Oh, my wow! Nope! Nope! Nope! What is happening? - Why are you touching me, woman? - What is wrong with you? Personally... women are the filthiest creature... on heaven and earth! So you'd better leave or I make you leave. Well? Leave. Where's my girl? She just left. But she was right next to me a second ago. Where is she? She left. I think she left with your boyfriend. Are you mocking me? Who do you think I am? She left. - You're not kidding? - No! Baby! See? Sigit! You were visited by a ghost again last night, right? I heard commotions from your room. I saw a ghost. A new one, introducing herself. But this one is different. I can talk to her. So now you can talk to ghosts? Just this one person. I mean, this one ghost. You'd better take advantage of it for money. What do you mean? I'm sure every house has ghost in it. And some of them are haunting. Sometimes, people don't know how to handle ghost situation. And then you come and get rid of the ghosts. I don't even know how to get rid of them. Ask your new ghost friend. Ask her to talk to those ghosts to leave the living people alone. Good point. That's a cool idea. Now, can you be my assistant? Are you kidding me? Not only I can't see ghosts, I can't even take a shower without bringing a company. How about them? Does any of you want to help me get rid of ghosts? No, thanks. We're practicing our skills for national PUBG competition. He won't say no. No frigging way! I'd rather practicing my PUBG skill with Fani, Siska and Bambi here. I want to beat that Pevita... What's that actress' last name again? - Pevita Pearce? - Yeah, that girl! Why all the people I know play that same game? Listen, I'm offering you a job that used to be our hobby. - We loved to hunt ghosts. - No, you listen to me. Come here. I have a rule in my workplace. Can your ghost accept that condition? Can you talk like a normal person? This is the queer zone! Can your ghost friend accept that condition? Of course she can! We're the first one doing this in our country. We're gonna be famous. Can I just play PUBG? Are you sure you want to keep playing that? It will deform your fingers. And break your nails. Do you want to stop doing mani-pedi? Of course not. Okay, but I have conditions. Tell me, bae. - Why am I talking like you now? - You'll get used to it. No, I refuse! Tell me the conditions, bro! I want Alexa in our team. Then I'll join too. Do you mean Alexandra? Yup. You don't want her? Okay, forget about me too. Why didn't you stop me? You should've held my arm. Fine. Let's go to her place. Okay. Hey, Fani, Siska and Bambi. I need to go somewhere. I have an important meeting with him. Let me go change first. Take care, bae! Look at his sexy body. I know, he's so strong. So strong and so big. I'm not a real man. I'm a sista just like you. Sista Genjing, shall we go now? - What's our ride? - That. - You still have that bike? - Of course. - What did you name it? - Waskito! I sound masculine enough? - Here's the key. - Why me? You're taller than me. Geez! - Do I need to wear helmet too? - You have to wear it. - It will ruin my hairstyle. - It's for safety reason. And I won't buckle it up. Let's go, Waskito! This is safer. Look, no break! Stop! Stop! Waskito! - Help me up. - Yes, Madam. You got it right. I'm a woman. Oh my gosh. - Are you sure she works here? - She said so. She works at this repair shop after resigning from a bank. Why did she quit? She didn't like it there? No, but she's a trust fund child. She was in the mood for quitting. I forgot, she's a rich girl. Maybe I can borrow some money from her. Don't even think about it! She just got fired. Probably for replacing the ATM with the RX King engine. No, she had an argument with her boss. I know. Go find her. We didn't come here to chat. I was gonna look for her, but you kept talking! Can I help you? I'm here to see Alexandra. Stop clenching, you'll burst your liver. Is Alex here? - She's over there. - She's over there? Thank you. I tripped. Alex! Where is she? Hey! Ghost busters? And our co-worker is a ghost? - Yeah, Sigit knows a ghost. - That doesn't sound right. It sounds cool if I say I know someone who's in the government. Or if I know a police officer. But not so much when I say I know a ghost. - Sorry, two ghosts. - Who's the other one? - You are! - Yeah, right. But he's telling you the truth. It's our dream job since we were in college. We wanted to become, what's the title of the movie again? - "Ghost Busters". - That movie. - I see your point. - So, what are we waiting for? Let's do it. But is this your true calling? 100 percent! - Only when I'm 100 percent. - What? I'm practically unemployed. Business is so slow. And the rent is not cheap either. Will you help us, Lex? It will be just like we used to be. Sorry. I've grown out of it. What 'it' are you talking about? I don't understand. Thanks, Miss. Here's your tip to buy cigarette. - I don't smoke. - How about coffee? Sorry, I don't drink coffee either. Just take his money. Thanks, man. We'll take care of your money. We're her manager. If you don't want his money, then it should be okay if we keep it. Well? Do we have a deal? Sorry, Jing. - If she doesn't feel like it, we can't force her. - Then you're gonna be homeless. Thanks. Git! Let's go. Are we going home now? What are we gonna do now? - What did I tell you? - I'm here. What did I tell you? She's gonna turn us down. - Sorry, may I know your name? - It's Alex. Alex? It's too hard to remember. How about I call you babe? I think babe is more suitable for you. Wait, wait! I'm coming with you! I don't care if it's an ghost busting or whatever. I'm going with you. Don't worry, we're gonna be rich. Only if we get rich. But... But, the insurance won't cover this kind of occupation. - They won't cover possessed patients. - You're kidding, right? Yeah, right. Hurry! - Ride safe! - You're still naive. Let's go! Let's go, Waskito! Git. - Where do you live now? - Just across that street, turn right. If you see a big tree, turn right again to my street. It's not far then. This fried rice is so spicy. If we're hanging out like this with food in our hands... it reminds me of college. - Remember our expeditions? - Oh, please. Stop using big words! We were ghost hunting. That words didn't represent us. We're the expedition type of guys. I remember back then Alex was the most committed. No, the correct word is fearless. Do you remember when she talked about a book called "The Mystery of Mount Lawu". Then she dragged us there to prove it. You both were taking your sweet time I had to wait hours at the peak. If I were taking my time, that's normal, I'm a girl. But what's his argument? He's just a weak man. But there's one incident I will not forget on that trip. When someone's wee wee got stuck while he was peeing. It wasn't my fault. I was minding my own business peeing, and there they were kissing in the bush! That was the worst. It's like watching movie at the theater and the couple on A1 and A2 are busy with themselves. That couple at the back. He's so dumb. - Are they your ghost friends? - Not them. - Those two are long term occupants. - Long term like us. Ningsih! Ningsih! I don't like the fat one. He's a pervert. - Did you see how he's looking at me? - Let's just blow his belly up. Don't worry, he won't go any further than that. - Are you cold? - Why? - I can see your hard nipples. - Pervert! - Ningsih! - Where is she? Ningsih! Stop shouting! It's annoying and it's late. Stop shouting and start paying your rent. Sorry, Ma'am. Can you ride safe? I'm still a virgin. - Mike! - What? - I want to play with that spicy woman. - Just make it quick. - She just bullied Sigit. - Hurry up. Virgin my ass. Help! Ghost busters? Count me out. You should find a better job. - Please help us. - Sih. - Stop it. What? I'm just calling her name. I don't know what else to do. And Alex just quit her current job. And Genjing, he's contemplating quitting from the beauty salon too. Says who? Well? - Please? Help us? - Please, just a little. Fine, I'll help you. But I want something in return. Find the person who killed me. Sure, we'll help you. - What did she say? - She agreed. But what can we use as our base camp? How about here? Do you want to be a ghost buster or being busted by a ghost? Ghost! What did I tell you? This place is haunted. It's not worth it. Why are you running with us? Because I saw you all running. I forgot, they can't see me. What did she say? Where we're going now? How about to my place? I live alone, and this is so not worth it. - Are you sure? - Follow me. Why didn't you tell us? Why am I always left behind? - This is great. Your house is huge. - I know, right? No, this is my aunt's. She asked me to live here. - Is she single? Can I date her? - Watch it. This is a better choice for our base camp, than your boarding house. Hold on. Don't go anywhere. Close your mouth. I know you still have feelings for Bogel. Admit it. - She's our friend. - Stop pretending. If I was normal, I'd date her too. But you know I'm not. Here. See? One for you. And one for you. Do you have one in pink? We're a team, we should have a uniform. I have two spare uniforms from the shop. We can just add our nametag and our logo. Fine. But who's gonna advertise our business? - Do you bring your camera? - Of course, you told me to bring them. We're Ghost Buser. We're nonviolently kicking out ghosts. Happy New Year! We have handed out the leaflets, we have our uniform... and a nice shiny car too. I can't wait for the action. We're gonna be very busy. I bet our phone will ring off the hook. Nobody calls. But we handed out those leaflets. - Or Bogel didn't hang up the phone properly. - Hey! Look. This is the real proof. A full list. To err is human, you know. Hello, you're calling nonviolent ghost busters. How may I help you? Yes, can you find us some clients? Our business is as quiet as the cemetery. Quiet you said? Hello, you're calling nonviolent ghost busters. How may I help you? - Are you the ghost busters? - Yes, we are. Can you get rid of my ex? Do you mean she's already dead... and now she's haunting you? No, she's very much alive, but she's a hellspawn. Sorry, we don't take sob stories. Go call Uya Kuya for that, don't call us. What an asshole. Hello, you're calling nonviolent ghost busters. Can I help you? - Do you know Uya Kuya's number? - Do you think I'm a phone book? Stop calling us! We can't just sit around and do nothing. We have to sabotage. What do you mean? I can do it. I'm a woman. You can't do it properly. Let me do it! I told you. - Here's the money. - I'm accepting your money. Guys, look who comes to our base camp. - You're that Roy guy! - Yes. I think my house is haunted. I need your help to get rid of them. We went to your house last night. We've met your ghosts. And with a little persuasion from us they agreed to leave your house... and promise to never come back. Hello, you're calling nonviolent ghost busters. Can I help you? I'm calling from Penari Mas Village in Banyuwangi. I know you from your viral KKN story on the internet. That's not us. That title is already copyrighted. We're just Desa Penari without KKN. I see. I thought since it's still trending, why don't we make it more interesting? No, this case is scarier than that one. When can you come to Banyuwangi? Just give us your address, and prepare the money. - Okay, I'm sending you the address. - Thank you. So... it's been a week since my dancers are being harassed by the ghost. And we have to perform tonight. What if my dancers are being harassed by the ghost again on the stage? I see. Can I show you around? Yes, please. Come, Ningsih. I was talking to myself. Come on. Look! - Be quiet. - Let us handle this. - Go on. - Look. It's okay. What are you doing here? I just want to dance. She said she just wants to dance. I was supposed to perform in a show. But on may way to the show, I got in an car accident. You can dance with them... but you won't make your presence known. Okay? Okay. - Promise? - I promise. That ghost really can dance. What do you mean? - What is Ningsih doing there? - Sorry? No, thanks. I don't want to sing. Hello. You're calling nonviolence Ghost Busters. Yes, we can. Sure. Where's the address? PT. Sepoi-Sepoi. Jalan Santai Raya, next to a massage clinic? Great. Yes, Sir. - New case? - Lex, Ningsih, let's go. Jing, Tot, Mike. Let's go. Before we start, what do you want to drink? Juice? - Coffee? - Why not? - Milk? - Sure. We don't have them. Why are you offering them to us anyway? - How about three glasses of water? - Fine. Beautiful Mia. - Excuse me. - Wow! Bring us three glasses of water. But make them half full. And no sugar. We're tightening our budget. Yes, Sir. So, few nights ago... I went to check the studio with one of my security guy. Suddenly, a movie was playing on the screen. What did I tell you? Help! Don't leave me! I don't know which way to go. Help! I got a report that that the ghosts are scaring the customers away. - Excuse me. - Yes, serve them the water. - Here you go, Miss. - Thank you. Stop doing that to women. My gosh. I'm curious to see your secretary when your office girl looks like that. Good point. Mr. Adi, this is the quotation for PT. Kelas Teri. Please check if it's okay for you. - Who was that? - That was my secretary. She's my future wife. You have a great taste. She's perfect. If you compare her with martabak, she's the one with six eggs in it. What a lucky man. Mr. Sigit, please help us. Let's just go home. What's that? What is wrong with you? Ghosts are not supposed to be afraid of other ghosts. Are you scared? Don't embarrass me. Let go of my arms! - But I'm scared! - Let go! I'd rather have a catfight with any girl than seeing a scary ghost. Let go of my arms. Those human are not afraid, why are you? Where are they? Michael, Toto, get out! It's empty. - Are they fooling us? - Let's go back down. Let's just go home. Michael! Toto! - We can't find anything. Tell her. - Well, did you see anything? Oh my God! - Are you fasting today? - Why? My breath stinks? What is this smell? - Unpaid salary? - You have to settle that with them. - How many? - More than a few. We saw many of them. - Oh my God! - She has mangled face. Why do you need to line them up like that? The goat kid! I mean, the midget just passed away. I mean, he passed out. Wake up, kid. Alexandra. Genjing. Totok. Happy Birthday. Here's for Michael. Ningsih. And me. The rest goes to the safe. What am I gonna do with the money? If you don't want it, let me keep it. What are you gonna do with the money? I'm gonna send it to my family back home. - Give me some of it. - We can split the money. I know. I will send the money to my girlfriend. Who knows if someday we could get married. No matter what, we still have living relatives. Keep dreaming, Mike. What's wrong? Even as ghosts... they still care about their loved ones. Like Totok wants to help his family financially. And Michael wants to give something to his girlfriend. And me? Why am I here for? I don't have anybody. My kids after the got married with rich men... are disowning their jamu seller's mom. I don't know where they are. And my husband? He left me for a younger woman since the kids were still little. I don't have anybody. You have us. We are your family now. Me, Alex, Genjing, Totok, Michael, Ningsih. We are family. Of course. Beside Sigit, you have us too. She's right. We'll always be there for you, Ning. You have me, Ning. Thank you for being my friends. One more thing. After we finished this case... we're gonna find the person who hit you. Promise? But if we can't solve your case in this Ghost Buser I... maybe we will find your killer in Ghost Buser II. Because the producers told me there will be Ghost Buser II. - What is he talking about? - How do you know that? - They haven't offered you the contract? - No. - What are they talking about? - I have no idea. How about we take a day off? I need to go to a beauty salon. I agree. Ningsih, we're taking a one day off today. Where do you want to go? I don't want to go anywhere. I want to sit around and do nothing. You should enjoy your life once in a while. I mean, enjoy your death once in a while. I mean, just enjoy it! - No, I want to stay home and watch TV. - Okay, fine. - What did she say? - She wants to stay home and watch TV. What a sad little girl. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Finally she's home. What are you doing? Just listening the sweetest sound in the world. It's just meh. The sweetest sound in the world is the sound of AWM rifle with suppressor. Especially if you add the scope x8. It's unstoppable. I wish you don't choke on PUBG. It feels so good. It's so peaceful in here. Babe, can you do me hair massage? Hurry! Ew, gross. Cidadap Police Station Have you solved the hit and run case that night? We're still working on that case, Sir. The registration number you gave us, it was a fake number. How about the car? I remember it was a big car it's silver... and not many people own that kind of car. We're still investigating, Sir. This case is not an easy one. Please be patience. We're hoping to solve this hit and run case soon. Thank you. - Are you all still in school? - We're college graduate. Yes, and Yeyen got his S.Kom degree. What's S.Kom? It's Sarjana Kompor Meleduk (Bachelor of Blowing Stove). Then why aren't you looking for jobs? Where do you get your money from? We've sent many applications, but we got no response so far. And while waiting for them to respond, we're playing PUBG. I got the money from my dad. Good, you're home. Hey, fugitive. Give me the money you owe me for a year's rent. Can we not talk about a year's rent? How about I give you the money for three years rent upfront? Are you okay? - Give me a minute. - Sit down, Ma'am. I'm still shaking. I'm paying you three years' rent upfront. And I'm gonna give you extra... because I noticed you've been wearing the same dress for years. Here you go. Buy yourself a new dress. Thank goodness. So what I felt about you is right all along. You're the nicest and kindest person in the world. I know you're respecting your parents. Have you eaten? No, but thank you. Do you want to try my famous Karedok Bujur? It's called Bujur? Don't you know my full name is Juriah Cintami? No. I only knew your nickname is Bu Cin. I know, only few people know my full name. But since we're rekindling our relationship, I want you to call me Bu Jur. You're like a tenant to me. Buat I am a tenant here! You're right. Anyway, do you want to taste my Karedok Bujur? Thank you, but I have to pass. I'm still full. - Or do you want me to massage you? - No, thank you, Ma'am. - But aren't you tired for working all day? - It's okay, I'm quite fit. - But I'm a good masseuse. - Maybe later. Fine. I'm gonna keep the money. Thank you so much. And don't forget, if you have sore muscles, just call me, "Bujur! Bujur!" Okay? - Okay. You're welcome. - Thanks again. Thank goodness. A massage with Bujur? Sigit! Sigit. - You don't come here often. - You left your jacket in the car. It's so kind of you to bring it back to me. No, I'm not being kind. I'm just kinda lonely. Then let's find a crowded place. How about we go eat? I can give you a ride on my new bike, Miss Momoy. - I park it there. - I saw it. Let's go then. - Let me put my stuff in my room first. - Okay. Is anybody home? You must miss me. What did you do to Sigit? Why is he shrinking? Who? Sigit? Who the hell is that? Suddenly I feel uneasy. I can sense his dark aura. - Call Sigit here, right now. - But I don't know where he is! - Go find him! - But where is he? Excuse me, Sir. Who are you and why are you here? My name is Hartanto. I'm here to ask your help... checking my house. My wife and the house maid are still trapped in the house... and are haunting the house. - What happened to them? - I don't know either. How come? Where were you on the day of their death? I was already long dead before they were murdered. Why didn't you tell them to move on? I can't. My wife's anger is too strong. That's why I'm here... to take them to the afterlife. But if we delivered, what are you gonna give us in return? One more thing, I can't follow you inside the house. My wife has put a barricade that I cannot cross. She knew if I came, I'd discourage her from avenging her death. Mr. Hartanto told me he's sorry he can't go inside with us. His wife has put a barricade that he can't cross. Because she knew if he came, he'd discourage her from avenging her death. Mr. Hartanto can't go inside the house with us. His wife put a barricade that he can't cross. Because she knew if he came, he'd discourage her from avenging her death. I don't see any barricade. He's just afraid of his wife. He's just afraid of his wife. You're just afraid of your wife. That's a good point. That's a good point. That's a good point. Is he really though? Is he really though? Are you really though? I can't help it. He can't help it. He can't help it. Jing, one more question and I'll slap you in your face. Enough. Mr. Hartanto will stay here while we're going inside. That's it. - Give me the flashlight. - What should I carry then? - Carry this. - What's this? - That's a legendary flashlight. - Can we just go in? That's unfair. What should we do now? Wait, I'm gonna ask Ningsih first. Well, Ningsih? Can we enter the house? We can't enter the house We can't enter the house. - But why? - Ask her why. Why is that? The door is locked. What did she say? The door is locked. Like, we can see that! Let's find another entrance. Let's go. You go first. - Stop making noises. - I need a flashlight too. What if somebody hears it and comes? Is it locked? Just try to jiggle the handle. Perfect. - He had a good taste for a woman. - He looks like he was an intellectual. Look out. What's that? Open the cover. It's a painting. Look what we've got here. Open the cover. - Wait for me. - Hurry up. - Hurry up, Gel. - Just a second. - Yeah, hurry up. What took you so long? - Okay, let's go. Nothing's here. Let's go back inside. Hurry. - What was that sound? - I have a bad feeling about it. Turn around and look, Jing. Let's just go to another room. Okay. By the way, I'm sorry, Jing. - What do you see? - You have to look for yourself! Stop! Stop! Are you all okay? I'm okay. I'm okay too, I guess. Hold on. I feel different. Of course. This is a haunted house. It's not that. - I'm gonna be sick. - We already knew you're sick. It's not that, and I knew about it too. I'm talking about this! - Oh, dear, Genjing! - Don't pinch it! It hurts! - But you're mostly okay, right? - Can't you see I'm bleeding? I'm not okay! - Then what do you want us to do? - What are we gonna do? I don't know. All I know is we have to keep looking. I can stay with Genjing here. You two can keep looking for the ghosts. Ningsih is gonna stay with you here, okay? Enough with your sulking. We need to solve this case. - Please don't leave me here alone. - Sit down and relax. Hold this for me. What am I gonna do with the bell? Do you want me attract all the ghosts to me? It will make you safer. What are you looking at? Just like in the Parry Hotter movie. This ghost loves to watch movies too I guess. Who is this? Melati. What are you doing here? Melati? Tell me, how did you die? That's none of your business. May I know... May I know how did you die? No. But I can take you to the day I died. February 14, 2020 I will never sell this house, ever. I hope you understand that. Do you see the houses in this neighborhood? I bought them all. I'm gonna turn this neighborhood into an apartment complex. And once we built it... I can't imagine how are you gonna get out of your house. Are you threatening me? I said no. I'm gonna stay in this house and I will never leave it even after I die. Very well then. I love you so much. You were the only one I had in this life. Melati? I saw everything. We can help you. Get out What? Let's just leave. This is not a normal haunted house. Let's go. Well? I saw the ghost of his wife in the master room. What did I tell you? This case is too big for us. - But we have to wait for Ningsih. - But I thought she was with you. But a man should not be in the same room with a woman. I guess she went that way. This is not worth our lives to risk. Let's just leave this place. Let's go home. Sigit! I'm gonna die! Help me, Jing! Jing... Help! What did I do? Help us! Mind your own business! We come here in peace. Mr. Hartanto told us to come here. - Hartanto, my husband? - Yes. Where is he? He's waiting outside. They're good people. Just calm down. - Where have you been? - I went to get Michael and Totok. They agreed to come after I promised them my fee. Greedy ghosts! - Ghosts of fortune! - It's soldiers of fortune! We're sorry. We thought you were the thugs who were going to steal our house. They're sorry. They thought you were the thugs who were going to steal her house. What did she say? They thought we were a bunch of thugs. They're sorry. They still come here some times, looking for the deed of the house. And you're protecting the house by attacking them? Initially, we just wanted to scare them. Because if we killed them, our spirits will disappear forever. But why did you choose to attack them? Because I heard them say if they can't find the deed... they will burn the house. And they are gonna bribe the authorities to make them the legitimate owner of this house. So you're willing to sacrifice your spirit by killing them... because you don't want them to burn down this house? I understand. Now why don't we go outside and meet your husband? What are they talking about? Relax. Let Ningsih deal with the ghosts. - But I need to know. - We didn't get the last... - Conversation. - Yeah. Right before they leave. - Tok, Mike, go. - Not that one. What did they discuss about? - They discussed about a lot of stuff. - Tell me! - But my brain is too small to remember. - Good point. - Whose car is that? - I don't know. Maybe other gang is interested in this house too. Could be. Let's use the back door. Okay. - My stomach hurt. - I'm thirsty. - Do you want something to drink? - What do they have in here? - I don't know. How about you? - Water will be fine. I surrender! I surrender! Okay. Are you scared? Are you? What are you gonna do now? Lay down on the ground. - How do you feel now? - Hey, shut up! Let them go. Or I kill her. Get up! Hurry! Why do you always seem to give me trouble? My leg is bleeding, asshole. - Hey! It's the other way around! - You're right. Moron. - You two, watch outside. - Okay. I suggest you not to do anything stupid. This house and the whole neighborhood belong to my boss now. Understood? If you refuse to cooperate... you'll die. See if I care. Stop doing this kind of job and marry me instead. - No frigging way. - I'm not talking to you. Well? They're coming back! Yes, we are. What took you so long to notice? I'm not talking about you. Let me possess him. He's kinda cute like a little gecko. Okay. - Do it now. - Do you think I'm scared? He's so big and strong. Hold on, let me untie you all. Take it with you. Take the rope. - Lock my arms. - I'm ready. On my count. Leave the body on the count of three. Don't stay in that body too long. One, two, three... Now who's the hostage? You deserve that. Wait. Why didn't we tie him while he's still possessed? - You're just making my job harder. - The rope is cutting through your skin. Let him feel that too. Don't move. Admit it! You're the thugs who killed Mrs. Melati and her maid. No, we're not, Sir. We just following order. - We swear! - That's the same, moron. Whose phone is that? Hello? - Well? Have you secured the house? - We have, Sir. I'm outside, but there's a car blocking the driveway. - Whose car is this? - That's ours too. Just in case there's some stuff we can carry from this house. By the way, you can enter through the back door. The front door is locked. We forgot to bring the key. Bunch of morons. Gotcha! You're the person who hit that woman that night, aren't you? I remember your car. What is this? This is what? What's with the word salad? Sigit. Honey, stop! Just throw your anger away. Don't let the anger consume you and turn you into a monster. What did they say? Take them to the van. Quit that. Quit it! Miss, my wife and I thank you very much... for all the help we get from you. And as promised... I'm gonna let you keep this house.
