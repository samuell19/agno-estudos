Great. It says: "Welcome to Hell". WELCOME 6-CLASS (IN HELL) This year is going to be poop. How do you know? Oops. But something like that too. I just know it. Last year we were the kings. Fifth graders. We had this school under control. Nobody likes us this year. Yes that's true. I stay out of it. I'm good. I grow a mustache. I see nothing. Nope. But it hit me worst of all. Do you see that girl over there? She will torment me at every possible opportunity. Wait a minute, isn't that your sister? Yes. At least you have your own room. My grandpa stole mine from me. What? Your grandfather moved in with you? When is that? After his raid on the supermarket. Can i help you sir Yes, I want to see Maria. Oh, Maria is gone. We have switched to self-checkouts. Much faster and more efficient. You will like it. Will it be cheaper if I do all the work myself? We have specials every day, sir. -Seriously? -Yes, sir. -Let me through. I want to go on. -Please, no problem. CASHBOX - Please scan an article. -I'm talking to a robot. Please scan an article. I will do. Let's see if that works. Please scan an article. You get into my Nerv. Please scan an article. Yes / Yes. Sir Sir Sir, you should stop. Wait, I'll help you up. -My leg! Go away! Now please, sir. Go away! I am retired. Get out of here. -I can judo! -Go away! Leave the poor man alone! Your shop sucks. Are you insane? Stop! Oh, all right. You want to mess with me. You don't have more? That hurt. There is my little one. You didn't have to come here. I'm fine What happened to the mailbox? An idiot riveted him. Oh shit. Dad, are you driving again? Your driver's license is gone, remember? It's not gone, I forgot to have it extended. Now I'm supposed to take the driving test, which is idiotic because I've been driving for over 50 years. What am I supposed to do, starve? I'm coming in now. It just can't go on like this. Do not worry. This damn shop will never see me again. No, I meant that I have to leave everything behind Drive two hours each way just to check on you I didn't ask you to come! No, not you, but the police. Dad, I want to come, I want to be there for you. But maybe now is the time to think about it... No, I will not move! I built and am doing this house in here the last breath. You don't put me in a home! What if you moved in with us? Are you crazy? Relatives are like fish that stink after three days. Horrible ones Idea. We'd kill ourselves. Out of the question, sorry. Dad! I miss her too. And nothing changes if you let me torn out of my house and transplanted into yours. Oh man. Maybe we could miss her together. Yes, perhaps. But there is no room in your house. Where would you put me Under the roof? Under no circumstance! Now don't make it any harder than it already is. It's the only choice. Dad! If it's the only choice, then it's not a choice at all. "Choice" means you have to choose between at least one decide two things. And that's just one. Unless the other is that I'm in the garden sleep and be eaten by a bear. Don't make a drama out of it now. In addition, your sisters already share a room. Yes, Sarah already told me that. You live in the clouds, because your way is so far. Wait a moment. Shh! Shh! Shh... -Hey I'm back again. - Shh! There is no bathroom in the attic. And Grandpa doesn't manage all of these levels. And the basement... is the basement. -Ha! -What? My Jordans! They have new laces. Hey Peter, should we help you move? Disappears! This is still my room. Not for long. Get out of here! Go away! Go away! Peter, I know it's not ideal, but we are a family there you have to sacrifice for each other. Sometimes pretty big sacrifices. Listen. There you have a lot more space than in this room. Now the attic will be your new room. No, he won't. The attic remains where you put things and then they Forgets, like our old TV or the exercise bike that Dad used to use. Right. What? I train with it. Just see it as a new beginning, okay? We'll clean up thoroughly and maybe put some nice wallpaper on. Your turtles wouldn't hurt if you had a better view. They like it that way. There you have your privacy. Do you still like that, honey? Yes. Grandpa! Grandpa is here, Grandpa is here, Grandpa everywhere. How nice that Grandpa is coming and he'll stay there forever. Hey Hey And please remember: we don't want to overwhelm Grandpa. He should first settle down. There's plenty of time to talk to him over dinner. -Oh, I won't be here. -What? What? I'm studying with Russel. "Learning" is still learning, isn't it? It's not slang for anything else? No dad. "Learning" is still learning. And I got the okay from mom. Grandpa! Jenny! Don't knock him over. Oh man. -Hi, Grandpa. -Hello Mausezahn. Ed. Artie. Where is your brother Peter? Peter? Peter! Come on, let's help Grandpa with his luggage. -Okay, give it to me. -Let it be. OK. Then I'll take the suitcase. He called me "Artie" again. Please Arthur, this is really not easy for him. Hey grandpa. Hey there you are Look at you. Look at you. You grow faster than grass. Oh, chic sneakers. Thank you. Do you like your room? -Yes, looks nice. -Sure, because it's beautiful. By far the nicest room in the whole house. Oh I know kid Listen, I didn't want it to happen that way either. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices in a family. You're right. That's true. Sometimes you are not even asked. There we are already two. Oh yes, be careful with the floorboards. They're uneven. I will think about it. Thank you. I'll see you later, Grandpa. You can come visit me anytime. In the attic... where it is teeming with spiders and mice. - Peter! -I didn't do anything! So here we are. You've been robbed, dude. No, I was attacked. The worst part is that I can't even complain about it. But you're complaining a lot for that, Peter. I mean at home because he's old and we all love him and stuff. You cannot let the enemy take your booth. You have to fight back and stand up for your rights. I do not have rights. Everyone has rights. They are, uh... un-something... has something to do with pursuit of happiness. Thatâ€™s the constitution. Yes, that would be great if I lived in North America. But apparently Burlington Avenue is 153 in North Korea. Did your parents know this when buying a house? What? I wouldn't put up with that. I would ask for my room back or there would be a war. "Or is there a war"? Should he attack his grandfather? Only secretly, of course, Emma. He cannot fight him in the normal way because his grandfather is strong, is big and experienced, while Peter is only weak and small. And dumb. You're a bad friend. Hi Steven. Mom says you should put on your flip-flops for a shower after exercising. Not cool, Lisa. My brother has athlete's foot. Totally gross and contagious. Contagious? And gross. Only six toes are affected. That's a lot of toes, bro. Hello grandpa. Hello my sweetie. Do you wanna play something? I have "reindeer races" I have "Christmas World", I have "1-2-3 Christmas porridge". Maybe, but not now, okay? Do you want to see a movie I have "Frosty the Snowman". I do not think so. Okay, little mouse? Maybe tomorrow? OK. What's the matter with Grandpa? How so? What happened? He just doesn't want to do anything. He's just staring out the window but there's just this dead tree Daddy always wants to cut down, but he's not allowed to use the chainsaw. Daddy can use the chainsaw anytime, snail. OK? He just decided to wait until Mommy says it's okay. Nothing is with Grandpa. He's just very tired and thinks a lot about Grandma. All good okay OK. Go away, go away! I hate my life. Oh come now! Ouch. "Declaration of war. When in the context of human events a person vacates the room steals from another person, there is no choice but to war. You have 24 hours. Give me back what's mine here or face the consequences. Secret Warrior. " Nice handwriting. Bad? Not at all. You know it's a change, so... Who are you talking to Uh, with Jerry, I'll be done soon. No, I would really like to, but I can't I'm kind of stuck here Yes. Hello Jerry, Sally here. Hey -He's not stuck here. -What shoud that? I can drop it off when I drive to work. Listen again. See you then, Jerry. Are you going to be helicopter mom now? Are you going to pack me sandwiches with a note in it? A note? Maybe you don't like what it says. I'll meet him another time, don't feel like it now. You haven't seen Jerry in years. Now you live nearby. That'll be nice. I can't and I don't want to. I still have something to do. I have to take care of that Take care of light switches in my room. Artie installed it upside down. Did you! Eat up. We're going in 10 minutes. Yeah mom How are you grandpa Slept well? Like a marmot. Thank you. Is there no newspaper in the house? Yes, there is. Here you go. Ahh, I can't read that. Just make it bigger. So. Oh yeah. Jenn... How does she actually survive? She doesn't eat anything. No idea. You have to go, Peter. OK. And? No nightmares? I? No. Sleep disorders? I only have eight words left on the screen. Don't you want to talk to me about anything? Now everything is gone! What have I done? How... Peter, I'm waiting! Well, if you want to talk later, we can do that. Have fun at school. Didn't he say anything about it? Not a word. One should get that. And I don't get you, man. I mean, you just slip the note under the door? Maybe he hasn't read it yet. Yes, he did. It was on his desk. Maybe he's already forgotten? It happens to old people. This is happening to you, Steve. Oops. Well, something like that... The trouble is, you lost the element of surprise. The attack must be immediate. -You have chili in your backpack. - He knows that. Yes. Hi Steven. Oh god no You left your braces in mom's car. There's still a chocolate bar in there, it looks like. At least I hope it is. See you afterwards. Yes, it's a candy bar. Are you making good progress, Arthur? Great yeah If you like big boxes. The fame of this company is based on them. Yes. Yes, probably true. Are you sure this is the Walmart profile? Walmart? I thought this was for Kmart. No, Walmart. Oh man. I'm sorry. I have so much on my mind right now. My father-in-law moved in with us, so... No idea. Somehow he doesn't think much of me. He thinks I work for a soulless group of companies who are not interested in worries and needs... ... of your employees. I wish you a lot of fun. How do I get home again? Well, you could walk. Or you can take this. I already have a cell phone. It's not a cell phone. I don't even know exactly what that is. Put it in. Okay, that's a ride called "Lyft". If you want to go home, just swipe over and someone will pick you up. You don't need any money, you don't even have to talk to anyone. Wipe. Wipe over it. Bye dad. Oh! Yes. -Greetings to Jerry for me. -I will. Holy shit is this all yours? All young dreams come true here. Are you crazy? Guys can't afford that. The pool table alone costs six grand. And you play with it all Of course, of course. What do you feel like doing first? Play billiards? Gym or football? And what the hell is that It's a onewheel. It's a lot of fun. And you can drive that thing? Shit yeah Epic! Should see me. Wow! Yo, Jerry! Oh! I didn't know you had a visitor. This is my old friend Ed. Ed, hi, Danny. My pleasure. So are we going for a walk? Yes. Oh good. Because my masseuse told me when I was the week Take 10,000 steps, then she meets me for coffee. And you know what "coffee" means. Coffee? Yes, coffee. Morning ladies. Seriously, dude? These yoga pants kill me again. Why are you doing this? What? They think I'm cute. Yeah, like, "Sweet, the old guys. Still think they have a chance." Hey I'm a good catch. I'm getting a great pension. Two more years and I can ski for free. Do you ski? No, I do not. Tomorrow. Beautiful morning. How are you? Lovely. Yes, delightful. Mention the pension next time. As if you would ever ski. So how is it with your daughter, Ed? Okay. I have my grandson's room, which he doesn't think is great. He sent that to me yesterday. "... no room,... no choice,... consequences". Wow! And your answer? Nothing at all. -You want to let that go? -You have to answer that. This aggression requires a counterattack. Semper fi . You were in the marines? Not me. I just mean... He's a kid. He gets used to it and so do I. I'm his grandfather, so he won't do anything. Are you crazy? You have to do something... "House thieves have forfeited the right to a good night's sleep." Peter? Hey peter! Grandpa. Are you that? Yes, it's me and you know it. Do you know what time it is? Bedtime? It's the middle of the night. Come on, that's not funny. I don't like it if someone plays tricks on me, even if it's my grandson. This is not a prank. This is war. You are not waging war against your family, you are against the enemy. And I'm not your enemy You have my declaration of war. Why did not you say anything? Because I was hoping it was a joke. It's not a joke. You took something away from me and I want it back. OK. Go back to sleep, I got it. But now it's over. We'll see you tomorrow morning, respectively, soon. Grandpa? I love you. I love you too. But the war continues. Hello grandpa. -Hey, Jenny. -May I come inside? Sure, why not. Because I wasn't allowed to stay with Peter. I always snuck in when he wasn't around. Come on in. What can I do for you? Nothing. I am just curious. Do you know it's my birthday soon? Yes I know. OK. I just wanted to make sure. What's this? These are marbles. Can i have one Sure, but promise to take care of it. They are special. You are not magical. People always say that things are magical and they never are. No, I didn't say they were magic but they are special. Come here. You know that grandpa used to build houses? Yes, before I was born. That's right, you haven't existed yet. But if you have a When building a house, you always start digging first. And for some reason you almost always find marbles because they roll everywhere and are easily lost. And with almost every building pit that I've dug, I have found a marble or two. Guess what I did. What? You collected. And now if you count all these marbles do you know how many houses i built. That's a lot of houses. I also worked a long time. Why don't you work now Because I'm retired now. What is retirement That's when you stop working and can do other things. Your grandmother and I had many plans but, sometimes it turns out differently than you think. Can I have a marble now? Yes. Watch out, little mouse, watch out. Are you okay, Grandpa? Yes / Yes. I'm just resting a little down here. Do I still get a marble? Take what you want Oh no no no no What's that noise up there? Grandpa lost his marbles. "Come to my room. Immediately." -You wanted to see me? -Yes. Come in. Close the door. Sit down. So, you know the jar with all my marbles? No. How should I know what you've got here in your room...? That used to be mine. It's good. That's funny. Very funny, actually. Everyone likes pranksters. I thought we were through. Just tell mom and dad you got the room want to trade with me. Then it's done. You really want war? Because I participated in one. It's not like video games. Even if you win, others will be hurt. I just want what's mine And do you play with fire? I do not play. Okay. And what are the rules of the whole thing? What? We need rules about what is allowed and what is not. - There are no rules in war. -Oh yes, and if. "Rule number one: no collateral damage the civilian population or their property. " That means it shouldn't endanger your parents or your sisters. I Agree. "Rule number two: don't talk about it." BEHAVIOUR RULES This is hand to hand. Just between the two of us. Nobody betrays the other. I Agree. OK. Sign! All right, your wish comes true, "Secret Warrior". OK. "Old Soldier". From now on: "Take better care". The jungle: big and small, exotic and live here bizarre animals in the same place and at the same time next to each other. The game is called: survival. The use: eat or be eaten. Those who attack first get another one Enjoy the day. Those who sleep will be eaten. OK. Okay. What kind of stuff is that? "Quick drying assembly foam" . I'll kill him. Don't mess with me, you little... Do you think you're smart? Then you did the math without the landlord, my friend. You will be sorry for that, I promise you. Do you think you're smart? Not even close! Nobody will ever know! I don't know what you are talking about. You're doing very well, Grandpa. Thank you, little mouse. You are a very good teacher. Why is your face so red I dont know. Maybe I'm allergic to something in this house. Well, I'll be in the shaving cream then. I mean... school. Uh, Peter! is that your folder? Yes, thank you. Have fun at school, kid. I love you. Hey pete How's your super unnecessary war going? Not good. I was awake the whole night. could not sleep. Diarrhea? What? No! My grandpa. Your grandfather has diarrhea? No! There is no diarrhea in history. I did everything you said and got him hit a few times too. This morning I put Tabasco in his coffee. Until now nothing. Dude, your grandfather works with psy-ops. Psychological warfare. Or, he's just grown up. Peter? When you've chatted enough, you'll want us maybe read your essay about your summer vacation? Yes, sure. "My Summer Vacation" by Peter Decker. This summer vacation was the best I've ever had. I've ridden a lot and haven't showered anymore until I stunk like a monkey's bottom. Please read on, Peter. Go ahead. I do not want. This is not my... Read I figured out how to freeze my own farts in a bag. I didn't write that. Sit down again. We'll talk to each other after class. Psy-ops. Amateur. What's going on here? Uh, nothing, nothing at all! We only have... I brought her some vocabulary exercises. Really? Vocabulary. Russell, get out! Mia, you stay. What about the rule that says no Boys are allowed into the house when nobody is around? Oh, my god, mom, don't blow your mind. We didn't do anything. I used to be your age too. -You? I can not imagine. -Oh no? -No. You are already... -What? You already are, you are... Say it. The vocabulary exercises really paid off, honey. What the hell...! Well, you started it, kid. He got me full. I got him full. Tape at the end of the door, as if I wouldn't smell something like that for a hundred meters. -Beginner! -Tesa at the end of the door. It really doesn't get any more stupid. Go back, I'll tee off. Yes. I'm already gone. Let's skip the hole. -Good idea. -Yes. I wonder how Grandpa is doing golf. My Jordans! Dude, I think your grandpa must be a ninja. My Jordans. The first time? To my chagrin, no. What are you, a spy or something? No. I'm just trying to outsmart my grandson. We are in the middle of a war for his room. I just moved in with my daughter... No, don't say anything. Then nobody can force me to testify against you. I am mute. I help you. Give me one last try. Oh, stupid... What am I doing wrong again? Oh no no You have to go through it on your own, otherwise you will never learn. Do you like that? Well, you see, it's okay. Bam! Cars like this VW Beetle from 1974... We had one like that too. The clutch was broken and we replaced it. I know. You dropped the flywheel on my toe. Themselves to blame. I wasn't the son you always wanted. Don't we want to look at something else? Maybe... Netflix? The weather channel? Home shopping? Oh yes, "the Grinch", please. Good idea! Hey, I'm going over to Skyler's. What? Now? Yes, for learning. You want me to go to a good college don't you? Okay, see you. She's seeing Russell, I know that. -What? -It's none of my business. Spit it out before you choke on it. OK. Just don't start a fight with her about her boyfriend. With you it took me two years. Yes. When you started dating Artie. I don't know anything about that. But I. It was awful. I was always at home. Yes, you were at home talking to your mother. You never came to me. -Really? -Yes. -Excuse me. -No, it's okay, it was my fault. I thought he wasn't good enough for you until I realized that that wasn't the point. You said he was good enough for you. But, now you get on well together. Because I pull myself together. But, I will always miss these two years. Wow! Yes, thank you very much, Ed. I've come to terms with you. I mean that very seriously. But as for your career... What? Dad! Nothing against Artie, I just think that people who get their dreams out of the Losing eyes and settling for less, never being happy. Really? Well, I think the same people value a secure income. Which then enables them to take in their aging father-in-law. And my name is "Arthur". Come on, sparrow time for bed. March off. Night, little mouse. -Night. -Good night. You did a great job again. sorry. I can't reassemble anything. He has all of them Screws hidden. Now I have to sleep on the floor. That's really funny. Yes. Haha. Dude, you may have to admit that you're not as smart as your grandfather. Billy, wicked snake. Thank you. Steven, the dog was chewing on your underpants again. These are not mine. Really not? "Captain Steve" is written on the waistband. Make you come out! "Captain Steve". You see, it's very easy. Yeah thank you baby And now, out with you. You have helped me a lot. Well, who said it? - I know what you could do, Peter. -So what? You could use some of your mental energy that you waste on Using stupid pranks on your grandpa to get rid of your 4 in math. Who cares about math? This is real life. ... says the guy who builds a virtual castle in a video game. Petersburg is not a castle, it is a palace. And after almost three years of construction, it is as good as finished. Keep on dreaming. Ah no. Oh! And then see if the light is on again. No no no! Every beginner knows that. What was that? GRANDPA'S COOKIES Do you have them with you? Do you have the money You don't need to count. I know, Pete. I trust you. Not funny, Peter! Don't hurt me, I won't hurt you either! You can do what you want, only: don't bite me! You know what, I'm just going over here. You don't mind, Eddie. Stay away. Stay away. Stay away! What's this? An emergency chain. A what? Like the ones from advertising? You want me to wear this? It's out of the question. No way. I'd rather die. You know you can wear them under your shirt and nobody will see anything. It's great. Dad, if you don't want to wear it for yourself, wear it for me. -But I don't need that. -Really not? If I tell you Because Arthur meant that you would have acted very strangely. Oh yes? For your information: I didn't say "strange". I said, "extremely confused". "Confused". Dad, is it so hard to believe that we're worried to make you You probably never need to use them. That's right, because I'll never wear it. Dad, it would just comfort me to know that you are with Get help when you need it with the push of a button. You're welcome. You're welcome. Nice necklace, Grandpa. Just watch out, my friend. And that's how you found him? Yes. I couldn't reach him online and was worried. My life's work, a ruin. That's just a pile of rubble. He ruined Petersburg. I've built on it for more than a third of my life. Strictly speaking, three twelfths are exactly 25 percent, that's less than a third of your life. That's how it is. Everything will be fine. Ah, I was right, honey. The little one slowly comes to his senses. Do you both promise to only use words? Promised. Why do we have to do this? When conducting peace talks, you need a neutral mediator otherwise it degenerates into screaming at some point. This is stupid! It took me five minutes to get on this To sit down in a chair, I'm not getting up again. Grandpa promised. Now you have to promise. Okay good. I promise it. Well. So, the hostilities are getting stronger ran the rudder than anyone could have foreseen. You don't mess with someone else's computer. That's not cool! Everything is allowed in war, kid. War! I just want my room back! Don't shout! I don't do that at all, he screams. Apologize to Grandpa. No, leave it alone, little mouse. -Love you, Grandpa. -Love you too. -Stop it! -With what? -What's going on here? -Nothing's going on here. You should be neutral! I don't even know what that means. You can't pretend that you like him better than me. But I like him better than you. He gave me a cookie. Okay, that sounds worse than it is. Right, a biscuit has changed hands but long before this trial was scheduled. With chocolate chips. My favorite variety. My Also. Okay, that's enough. The peace is canceled. Don't shout! Fuck it all! You don't say "Fuck it"! Peter. Do I get my second cookie now? Peter, now please wait. That cookie was wrong. So maybe I wanted to Influence the mediator, which in hindsight was somewhat inappropriate. "Somewhat inappropriate"? Come on be honest, you have a preconceived opinion went into this negotiation. You didn't want to give peace a chance. What for? You destroyed Petersburg. But that's what I was trying to tell you. War isn't just any game, Peter. Only children, fools and generals think so. War hurts. War wounds, kills and causes misery. We have to end this somehow. And how? How about one last competition and the winner gets everything? What kind of competition? I have no idea, choose something. I do what you want and then the spook is over. -What I want? -Whatever you want. OK. It's not a rendezvous. We are missing the fourth in the team, it has to be a woman and I don't know anyone else. Just a moment. They want me to be Help you get your grandson to the cart to drive because the two of you can't live peacefully under one roof? You can also put it that way. I will participate. Sometimes my granddaughter robs me of the last nerve. Oh heaven we're dead Intimidation tactic, that's all there is to it, Danny. Just don't show them your fear. That makes them strong. They are like baby velociraptors. Yes, exactly, velociraptors. Do you even remember how to play dodgeball? Was there a dodgeball in the century? There have been smart asses, I know that. And remember not to aim for the head. Not even on the eggs. Spare the crown jewels. You heard him. Do you have your adhesive cream with you, old man? Your wrong bit is about to take off. Big words for a baby. Do you want to change your diaper first? No you maybe -Men! -Who are you telling that. You'll love the attic, Grandpa. Don't be too early, my little one. -It starts! -It starts! Yes! Hello! Run for your life! Fire! Why did I get involved in this? Man on the ground. Hey, not upside down, we said! Oops. Has slipped away. And from! Teenage Team: One. Senior team: zero. My ears are ringing. That is barbaric. Shut up, Danny, pull yourself together. Who is this? Come here guys. It looks like they're way too fast for us. We have to play our own way if we are to win. Am I right? -Yes. -Yes / Yes. I have an idea. So,... Game two! On your places! Grab them! Fire! Yes. Now you have a problem. Boom! Out! Out! Out! Caught twice, one hit. Three points. Come, you seemingly dead, show me! Well, if that's not Mr. Headshot! In the balls. Oops. Has slipped away. End of game two. A draw. Last match. The winner gets it all. Are you okay again? Come here.

Yeah, that doesn't count. The boy was already out and he throws like a chick. Diane, that was fire from our own ranks. Are you playing for the enemy now? You three, get out! Sorry, Peter's grandpa, but now you are due! Where is the female solidarity? Sorry, little one. You weren't shot down for nothing. This is so stupid. Yes / Yes. You're out, get out! -Show him, Ed! -Yes. - Go on, Peter! -Finish him! -Get your room back. -Yes exactly! -Show him what's a rake, Ed! -Go on, Ed! What are you waiting for? Go now Next comes an eighth birthday. A draw! -That doesn't exist! -No! What? No way! I caught his ball before it caught mine. I caught his first. - Seriously, he caught him before him. -He dropped his. Not true at all. He has butter fingers. Here please. He is old. His fingers don't work. The finger works. Okay, that's enough. The game is over. Goes home. All of them, seriously. I have won. You lost. What are you talking about? I clearly caught the ball in front of you. Is there a bar here by any chance? What's this? I just scribble. This doesn't look like one of your usual "boxes". Yes. I find it interesting and really very beautiful. For work? No, the city has put out a tender for an extension the library and I thought I'd submit my draft. But you know how it is. They always choose one of the big companies. 100 percent of the shots on goal that you don't try don't go in. You know who said that? Uh no. Wayne Gretzky. Best ice hockey player in the world. I was just about to say that. The great? The biggest. Still not a sports fan? No. Is good. -Over here! -Ready to sedate! Just lie there, sir. -What do you want from me? -Quiet, sir! We'll save your life, sir. Holds him tight! I just bought it, you idiot! Don't panic, sir, you are in good hands! Get rid of that thing or you're dead! Patient defends himself. We may need fixations. Hold still, sir. Relax sir! Wow, this test was difficult. I found it very easily. Come on, get in. Uh, thanks, but I think I'd rather go by bus - with my friends. Come on now, get in. Until tomorrow. a friend of yours? This is chuck. You don't need to know more about him. Um... Where are we going? Clear Lake. Nice there, you'll like it. You already know that I'm only 12? I still have my whole life ahead of me. Maybe one day I'll be president. Or be the first person to fly to Mars. Holy hoe! Get out! You know mom is expecting us for dinner. Maybe I should call her and tell her where we are. Don't worry, we'll bring dinner with us. I rented it for a couple of hours. I thought, let's do something together and go fishing. Does that sound good? Very good. It's definitely boring. I do not think so. One took a bite. Pull him up! Seems like a lot. Hey It's huge! Come here Yes. This is not a fish, this is a whale. He put up a lot of resistance. We're all fed up tonight. I'll give you some new bait. Thank you. OK. And eject! Really really good. Thank you. Kind of fun. Yes do it. That's what happens when you bury the hatchet, you see? How do they bite? Pretty good. I caught some nice ones. I'm happy for you. That is definitely because that not too many people fish here. Because it's forbidden. -What? -What? You can ask the ranger. Here he comes. -Throw the fish out! -But why? Overboard with it! -How so? -Make it up! The cool box! Forget the cool box. You're breaking the law! He's catching up with us. That's right, he's catching up with us. What are you doing there? I'll call Chuck to pick us up. Did he leave us behind? What kind of friend is that? Friend? He is my driver. I don't know the guy. Stop immediately or you will face the consequences! Hold on, the landing will be tough. Hurry up! Why didn't you tell us that fishing is prohibited? I wanted to rent the boat! Stop! Stop! -That was so cool. -Yes, it was. But breaking the law is wrong, you know that. Yes. I know that. Stop here, chuck. I want to show you something, Pete. I built this house, which is now empty. The color is different, I don't like it. What do you think? I think it's good. Maybe you are right. You know, over the years, when I wasn't in a good mood I drove over and looked inside. I've seen the people live in my den, raise their children lead their lives and have I felt better. Do you feel better now? Yes absolutely. Should I tell you a secret? -Yes. -Then come with me. People who build houses usually sign their work, just like artists do their paintings. Really? Yes, but always only hidden. Some write their names on a rafter, some hide one Newspaper with the date the house was finished under the floorboards. One always has a poem at the bottom of one Toilet written before he installed it. What did you do? I always had one of my men take a picture of me and your grandma. I built that into the wall next to the fireplace. That's why there are everywhere in this part of town Photos of me and your grandma on the walls. What nobody but you know Now you know. That's cool. You will become a real angler. Maybe next time we will find a lake where fishing is allowed... ... and which is teeming with perch. -Oh, really fat. -Yes, murderous things. -Grandpa? -Yes, Pete? Thank you for fishing with me today. I had a lot of fun. You are welcome. I had a lot of fun too. Let's do this more often. Yes. Gladly. I'll see you below. Great. Got me And properly. You are a dead man -Upps. -Aua! Well, something like that too. No, not again. Oops. But something like that too. The Santa hat goes right here. Have you already finished writing them? I'm still there. "Come and celebrate her super fun birthday party with Jennifer. Motto: Christmas" Great. Very good. Do you like it? Absolutely. Forgiveness? Is this busy? Thanks for coming with me. You never like to go alone on such occasions. Carl and I have had many adventures together. He'll be missing, the old warrior. How is he...? You already know... Fell asleep. When skydiving. You look good bro. Are you here alone, madam? This is my husband. I could drive you home. What the... Sorry. Crap. What? Damn it! I'm really sorry, Carl. I don't know the guy. Then tell me. How was the funeral yesterday? Really nice. Thanks for asking. And with you? Something exciting is going on at school. No. Unless you name a huge one Eighth graders getting punched in the face, exciting. Really? Yes. How did it come about? He got a full load of orange juice when he opened my backpack. Crazy isn't it? Hi Guys. Hey dad I'll turn the stuff off for a moment, then I'll help you to put the lights on the roof, Ed. Thank you Arthur. I said "Arthur". You both make a good team. Jenny's birthday is going to be so great. Now we just need one for early September Find Santa Claus and everything will be perfect. Forget Santa Claus. I know him personally. Consider it done. Thanks dad. Sweet of you. That's the least I can do. Mom, before you say "no", listen to me. Can I invite Russell to Jennifer's party? -No. -What? Why not? Peter's friends are coming too. It occurs to me that I invited Jerry and the gang. Yes, that is fine. Don't you see how unfair that is? I hate you! I don't want to hear it. Hey peter? Yes? Listen... In World War I, the Germans and the British have theirs on Christmas Eve Arms down to celebrate the holiday instead of shooting the enemy. Your sister's birthday is a special occasion and should be celebrated. I guess you are right Then we agree on a temporary truce for Jenny. Yes? I Agree. Ouch! Oh, stop it! You hurt me Au. Looks like fun. Yes, great fun. We also like to have fun. I forgot, I have to detention. Now you are alone I have a question. Do you know my grandson, Peter Decker? I thought to myself. -Into the trash. -What? It's getting easier without resistance, kid. Come on, fat man. -Shit who are you? -Shut your mouth! Disciplinary Committee. Leave Peter alone, understand? Phew, overripe. Not your lucky day, fat bastard. In with you No! No! Not! No! How disgusting! Get me out of here! Hello? Wow! Happy birthday, sparrow. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JENNIFER! HAPPY BIRTHDAY It is quiet. Too calm. Billy, you have a truce. His grandpa will certainly not do anything. And if it does, I'm prepared. Do you see the throne there? CHRISTMAS WORKSHOP Got a booby trap installed. Somebody here should blow up? Take off, Steve. This eggnog tastes like nothing. We can change that immediately. Watch out guys! Guess Who's Here! Ho Ho Ho! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus is here! -Yes, Santa Claus! -Juchhu! Not so stormy, I've got enough for everyone. Toys and sweets. What a child's heart desires. Wait a moment. This is not my grandpa. Ed? No thanks. I have to pay attention. You never know. The little one wouldn't dare to do that. You shook hands with it. No, these children cannot be trusted. Hey grandpa. Hey Nice party, what buddy? Yes, super cool. But I thought you were playing Santa Claus? I? Oh no, I leave that to the pros. Jerry has been giving Santa since he retired. Is that a problem, Pete? Why a problem? I'm only asking. Hey, would you be so nice and bring me some water? Thanks, kid. The boy is up to something, I can feel it. Certainly just a coincidence. Ho Ho Ho. And what's your name? Let me guess. 20 years ago it wasn't a name. I'm right? -Peter? -Dad, what's up? Do you know where Mia is? She should help me with the hot dogs. -No I do not know. -Okay, you help me then. Hey grandpa. What happened to you You are all wet. There are no answers to some questions. Hey, a cookie? -No not now. -They're delicious. -Thank you, I really don't want one. -Especially this one. -I do not like. -For sure? Absolutely safe. Please put mustard and ketchup on those things and bring them to guests before they get cold? Sure, dad. I take over in the front and you in the back? You are the boss. Oh man i'm sorry I slipped. I swear it wasn't on purpose. There is nothing you can do. Oh damn. The bottles must be too full. Hey dad? The lighting gives up its ghost, you check it out? Yes I do. And Peter, will you check on the compressor for the bouncy castle? It could be a little plumper. What is the lad up to? Grandpa! Dad! Dad! Dad are you hurt I'm good. Found a quarter of a dollar. Peter, we said no pranks. We shook hands with it. What happened? What are you two talking about? Grandpa, I swear I didn't do anything! Santa Claus is dead. Okay, maybe I was. That is not good at all. Danny, Ed,... Did you see that? That was awesome. Here comes Santa Claus. Ho Ho Ho! My sausages! Jerry! Everything okay? Where am I? Fire! Get to safety! I delete. I'll get the garden hose. Is good. OK. I have a pen... "From the face..." I'm blind, I'm blind! I do that! Grandpa, get out of the way! My Christmas tree! My Christmas birthday cake! Oh, what have we done? No no! Peter! Hi mom. Mia? Russell? Don't you dare run away, Russell! Nothing happened. Okay, and I can't help it. Hey, could someone help me? That's a pretty deep scratch, Mr. Marino. You should see the tree first. Thank you. What? What? There is nothing. I'm fine. Sure you are fine. You are always fine. Nobody should help you in any way or love you. Sally, please stop. You could have been dead! Come on, don't make it a drama now. It was an accident and nothing more. -An accident? -Yes. Do you seriously think I don't know anything about the "war"? Dad... or should I say "old soldier"? Oh, oh that. What did you guys think? Don't blame the boy. It's up to me alone. I'm an adult, I should have known better. God knows yeah I'm so sorry. It got out of hand. I have enough money to pay for everything. I'll get my old crew and we'll fix everything. It's not about the house or the money, Dad. If you hated staying with us so much, you should have said it. I never said I hated you guys. Exactly, you never told us. Yeah, I never said it. Have we got that sorted out now? No! Forget what you never said I was just thinking, when you come to us, you will notice that we love you and change your mind about living alone. But of course it didn't come to that. You are so keen on it... ...To have fun. -Are you okay, Grandpa? -Yes, I'm fine. I'm sorry about what happened at your birthday party. It's okay. I have something for you to make you feel better. That's kind of you. But I gave it to you, remember? Don't you want her? I think you need her more But it's only on loan. That's very grown up of you, my darling. You can take it home with you soon. The doctor just looks at the x-rays. We are waiting for you outside. Can I see him now? No. It will be a long time before we both get you back leave together alone. Maybe never. Will he get well again? Naturally. As for you and Mia, that's a different story. You are under labor arrest for the next six months. Work arrest? What is that, please? Room arrest plus household chores. For six months. -What? -Yes. Well, it adds up a lot, doesn't it? I haven't done half as much as Peter. That is so unfair. Will I also get work arrest? No, honey, you don't. Russell! You will please stay seated! What? Wait. Mom! Russell ?! Dad, can't you see her senses... Russell! You should stay seated, Mia. Leave me in peace! Come here now, you coward! Come here! Okay, that's enough. Mom is definitely crazy. I have to go there. Wait. I know your mother. She's getting herself back. You don't hit me, do you Mrs. Decker? No. What are you up to? What I'm not going to do is lose two years with my daughter, Russell. Take my hand before I change my mind. Come by tomorrow. Really? Yes. And bring work clothes. I have a huge hole on the first floor. That needs to be fixed. OK. And everything is alright? Thank you mom. I didn't hurt him. Everything will be fine. Let's get Grandpa and go home. Excuse me, could you see if Mr. Marino can go home yet? Oh, it's long gone. I assumed they were all gone. He said his brother would pick him up. Brothers? Yes. Chuck...? Chuck. Who is chuck Dad? Ed? Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Mom! Jerry doesn't know where he is either. I shouldn't have pushed him so hard. It's Peter's fault. Grandpa is gone because of him. Yes peter But now you have your room back. Are you happy? Peter? Wake up. I think I know where Grandpa is. I also like the fireplace a lot. Something like that is no longer built today. Thank you. Secrets hide behind these walls. Wait! I started it, I want to finish it too. Hi Chuck. -Grandpa! -Peter. So what's going on? You moved out of your room. It's your room, kid. It always has been. I've decided I want you to have it. I don't want you to go away, Grandpa. We both know that the room will always be between us. No it won't. I also love the attic. I don't know why I was so mad about the old, smelly room. Honest. Grandpa, you have to come back please. It's not that easy. I do everything too. I'll bring you every single marble back, I swear. Oh, Pete. Grandpa, please. You don't even know how ashamed I am. I just want to hide somewhere. It's all my fault. No, don't believe that for a second. We were both to blame. You only defended what was yours. Maybe a war like that starts and goes on and on. Your enemy does something bad to you, so you do something worse to him. And he takes revenge, and you take revenge. And the whole thing gets worse and worse. And at some point someone just drops a bomb. That's how it works, isn't it? Yes, that's how it works. I never want to go to war. I am very glad you said that. And I hope to God that you never have to either. Should I tell you something? Somehow I enjoyed measuring myself against you. Really? Yes. I could forget my grief for your grandma. And... you got me pretty bad a couple of times. Well, you me too. Yes. Please come home, Grandpa. Come here. 3 MONTHS LATER Well, Mr. Decker, if you'd sign here then. I actually wanted to cut the tree myself. But my wife has an aversion to chainsaws. I can use the chainsaw at any time. I believe you, man. And if you still what need call me at the office, yes? I mean, I can use the chainsaw anytime. A little more dignity, please. It's just a chainsaw. How so? Did she say something? Hey grandpa. I am ready to go fishing. Oh, Petey, I forgot to tell you. Fishing has to be canceled today. How so? We always go fishing on Saturdays. This is our thing. I know this is it. Unfortunately, I have other plans now. I'll make it up to you. And how? Maybe we'll go to the cinema or that new ice cream parlor. Ah, you see, this is for me. I have to go. We make something. Is something wrong? Because of Peter. Let's go. Grandpa! Grandpa! Hi, grandpa. -There! -His fingers don't work! No. Better this way. -Too much? - It fits! Oh! Sorry! Once again. Once again. I see you're doing... Nice, stimulates blood circulation. Russell! Russell! Russell! You have to cut that out. Shit sorry. I've got a frog in my throat. I want to be an opera singer. How did he move? The guy is still alive. In the next episode you will see... Again, right? Hey can i help you? Can i sniff you? Can i help you sir -Puff, absolutely. Yes! No, it doesn't do anything. Moment... -Oh, come on now. - Well, again. -What don't you do. - That's life. And you can drive that thing? Shit yeah Fun! S-P- and A-S-S. You should be able to spell. What was that now? You were in the marines? Nonsense. I just mean. You are so silly. In with you! Shit who are you Ok, it's in the box! ... I would work for a soulless group of companies who are not interested in the worries and needs of their... Okay, cut.Was good. Thank you too.
