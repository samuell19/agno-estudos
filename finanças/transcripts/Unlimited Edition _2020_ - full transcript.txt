CHAPTER 1 Excuse me. I noticed you were struggling with your eyesight. I've got an hour to spare. If you don't mind, I could read a page or two for you. Please. I can't see well with my right eye. I try to read with my left eye, and it's exhausting. I have an appointment with the eye doctor next week. We'll see what they say. I'm afraid it might be cataracts and I'll need surgery. "Capitalist realism can be seen as a belief: that there's no alternative to capitalism. Fundamentally, it's a pathology of the left. Ultimately, what capitalist realism amounts to is the elimination of left-wing politics and the naturalization of neoliberalism. It can be seen as an attitude of resignation and fatalism in the face of a sense that all we can do is accommodate ourselves to the dominance of capitalism, and limit our hopes to containing its worst excesses." "Instead of capitalist realism ending in 2008 or 2011, it could be argued that it was reinforced in 2013. The austerity measures that have been implemented constituted an intensification. Those measures couldn't have been introduced unless there was still a widespread sense that there is no alternative to liberal capitalism." "Capitalist realism is about a corrosion of social imagination: after 30 years of neoliberal domination, we are only just beginning to be able to imagine alternatives to capitalism." Is the author Argentinian? No, he's English. Mark Fisher. He killed himself three years ago. Well. I wish you luck in your visit to the eye doctor. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Edgardo, I'm going to check your eyesight. I'm going to cover your left eye. Can you see the letters over there? No, nothing. And those over there? No, I think... no. I can't see them either. And now? Nothing? -No, no. -Those ones? So, doctor? You have a mature cataract in your right eye. An incipient one in your left eye. I appreciate the fact that you didn't come with a diagnosis, but you need surgery. Can I make an appointment? Yes, you can have surgery soon, but don't you prefer to do it in Paris? In Paris I have the advantage that Social Security pays for it, but if I go there, I need to see the physician who will then refer me to the eye doctor. There's a chance the eye doctor is not a surgeon as you are. Before I know it, with all the waiting, appointments, whatnot, I'll have to spend two, three months in Paris. Spending three months in Paris when you're 30... When I was 30, yes. -See you soon. -See you soon. Can your father still read without glasses? That's right. Remarkable. I remember at school breaks, we were the only ones who would read. But your father also played soccer, so he was spared of the "faggot likes reading." -Bye. -Okay, bye. Can I take off this ridiculous cap? No, Edgardo, you can't. It's the protocol, you have to wear it. Besides, your curls might fall over your eyes. I'm going to monitor your heart with these electrodes. In the meantime, tell me what medicines you take. In the morning, Losartan 50 for my blood pressure. Two hours after eating, Zytiga, which is the medicine that controls my prostate cancer, alongside a minimum dose of cortisone: five milligrams of Prednisone. In the afternoon, Tardyferon, which is an iron supplement, because my red blood cells are a little low. At night, not every day, but if I've been... agitated or anxious during the day, I take half a milligram of Xanax. Just that, but not every day. What about the fun drugs? Not anymore. Take a deep breath. Very good, now breathe out. Good morning, Edgardo. It's time for surgery. It's time to be reborn. Great. Edgardo, surgery is over. Everything went perfect. This is an eye protector. That's great. It's a little like A Clockwork Orange, isn't it? Kind of. Bye! SUCCESS Excuse me for interrupting. I have a problem with my sight. I can barely see with my right eye, so I use my left eye, but I get tired. I need to finish an article for this weekend, and I thought maybe you could read just one page for me from the book I'm working with. A LOVER'S DISCOURSE: FRAGMENTS Hello? Hi. Serafín. Come in. -Osvaldo. -Serafín. Come in, come in. CHAPTER 2 It's Earl Grey, do you like it? I don't know, I haven't tried it. Does it have sugar in it? It is a sin adding sugar to this kind of tea. Lesson one: respect flavors. I don't like bitter flavors. You don't need to define flavors before you've tasted something. Take a sip and tell me what you think. It's good. What has your grandmother told you about me? That you're a learned man, different from everybody else in town, that you read a lot and wrote very well. I'd rather you didn't mention the town. Your grandmother was very kind, but the rest was awful. Thank God, I shook that small town off my system. She sends her regards. Thank you, send her mine. What kind of things do you write? I write little things... For little things, you might as well not write at all. Literature does not need "little things." Sorry. You don't have to apologize to me, but to centuries of accumulated art. Can I read something to you? No, not right now. You seem very distracted. You have to be focused to write. I'm going to read to you something I wrote today. I haven't read it to anyone. It's a draft. "In my wildest dreams, you comfort me. Trembling with sorrow, my hurt soul awaits its relief. A treacherous spear pierced it, and it bleeds. Oh, pain, oh, pain, oh, pain and despair. Poor me, hurt heart, come and cure this deep wound that throbs in the heart of the night. Am I awake? Am I asleep? Your indifference has hurt me deeply, I can't estimate the size of your contempt. It is too late now. You come for me, and I ask you to go away. No, not now, I want to bleed out in peace. It is too late for a rescue. Let me fade out slowly, as beautifully as a simple flower withers. Don't come near me, don't, don't look at me. This pain is mine, whole, complete. It is my only possession, don't take it away from me. Oh, poor me, oh, poor me." It's nice. We need to go beyond nice and ugly in our literary appreciations. At first I thought it would rhyme. It's free verse. Not everything has to rhyme. I just said it, I don't like rhyme either. When you learn to rhyme properly, you can decide whether you like it or not. Sorry. No, don't apologize to me... but to all rhymed poetry that came before you. More tea? No, thank you. I don't know why I offered. It must be cold already. I like lukewarm or cold. I don't like hot things at all. Oh. Come in. Wait here, please. I'm not decent. Today I will take you out to tea at a proper place. What are you going to do? You said you were going to stay. I told you... Please! I bet you had never been in a place like this. Honestly, no. The chairs haven't changed since I can remember. I don't usually go out to cafés. A writer needs to find a café that suits him. The café is the perfect creation. A little bit of get-together... a little bit of distraction... observation, concentration. Coffee helps. I write in my grandma's kitchen while she watches TV. TV... Television is the plague for writing. I like TV. So be it. Sometimes I write in my room, but not at night, not before going to bed, because I keep thinking and I can't sleep. And sometimes I write in the yard, with the radio on. If it's hot, I shower with the hose. I splash all over the notebooks and it's all a mess. Later I copy it on the computer, and it's all neat. The only thing I like about cafés is the windows. People go by next to us and they don't even know we're here. It's a good place to observe daily life. It's like being invisible. I'd like not to exist. Are we going to read or to talk about literature? No, this is just distraction. In order to write, you need to forget. Dispersion is the hygiene of writing. I'm always distracted. Everybody tells me so. If you notice everybody tells you so, you're not so distracted. Maybe. Or do you pretend to be distracted to provoke? Sometimes I don't get you. I think you don't have a sense of humor. Maybe. I don't laugh at just anything. Hey! Don't get so serious. We're here to have a good time. We're getting to know each other. If you're going to take everything I say so seriously, you'll feel intimidated. Maybe, I don't know. I feel I need some air. I'll finish my coffee and off we go. Do you want another one? No, if I drink more coffee I won't sleep. I'd rather leave. Who is it? I'm talking to you! I'm sick of you. I'm done. I don't want this anymore. Stop it. I'm going mad, I need clarity. Make up your mind. I don't like it this way. Decide what you're going to do, I can't stand this anymore. Wait here. Today we'll go for a walk. Where to? A writer is made of walks. As you say. Can I read something to you today? How impatient! Young people only yearn for accomplishment and approval. Your time to read will come. You will realize when it is timely to share your writing with me. Not yet. I don't know you well enough, and I might misjudge you. Writing has to do with waiting. Sorry, I don't know the rules. The only rule is patience, my dear. My grandma says I eat too fast, almost without breathing. Young people are always rushing. You should give yourself more time. Thank you for the advice. You don't need to thank me. You listened to my poem and you liked it. I should thank you. I liked it quite a lot. As a reward, I invite you to a coffee and we can continue our meeting. No, I don't like drinking coffee, it makes me nervous. Also, I have to go back soon, I prefer being outside. As you wish. This freshness that takes over my limbs... The kindness of clear water and its transparent modesty. Oh, water, everything flowing... everything becomes sea and tears. Oh, water, wash away my pain. Oh, water, offer me a final baptism. Is it free verse, too? It's so free I have just created it. Oh, how embarrassing. Help me get to the bathroom. How embarrassing. Open the shower. Get out. Get out. You can read something if you want. I'll choose randomly, they're all alike. No preface, please. "Grandma doesn't fall asleep until I come back. Sometimes it's too late and she fights sleep. I come, she serves me food, she asks me how it was, and while I tell her, sometimes, she disguises a yawn. In the kitchen, she keeps the same tablecloth, a pale yellow oilcloth. She keeps it spotless. If I let a crumble fall, she picks it up instantly. The oilcloth smells of lemon, that smell mixes with the smell of food. I tell her and she smiles. I told her I liked a dark-haired boy, who has a band but sings awful and is pretty funny. I like him so much it hurts, and I don't think he notices me. She says you never know the ways of love, and she keeps talking while she brings me fruit on a little saucer with a knife and a fork." CHAPTER 3 All the action... Sure. -Did you talk to them? -With Disney? Does that happen in your supplement? No... We'll avoid it at all costs. I never did that at least. -I'm in management. -Like you have people in charge? Sort of. You're a woman in her thirties recently separated. You have a five-year-old daughter who is spending the night with her father and his new partner. Until recently, when you were asked, "What are you?" you didn't know what to answer. Wife. Mother. Eternal student. Employee. Guys. These are veal. You published a book. A novel about a separated woman with a young daughter. So now when you're asked, you can say, "Writer. I'm a writer." What things do you care about? What do you know about books, movies, poetry, politics, philosophy, current events, literature? I don't know. Ask Juan. -I'll take these, but-- -How delicious. If you could ask for a wish right now, you would ask for money and time to write and read. But the problem isn't the lack of time or money. Before you can devote yourself exclusively to reading and writing, you need to know it makes sense. Certainty needs to be built around some kind of faith. The secret is to worship not the important or the transcendent, the magnificent, the sublime, but the trivial, the insignificant; the everyday stuff, the little things. Otherwise, writing becomes an impossible task destined for failure. Now you belong to a world you've always wanted to be a part of. But from the inside, that world is just like any other world. At the same time, the camera is behind the boy. You see the scene through... Where have you been, Juliette? I've been here all the time. You? I ran into Esteban and Marcos, and Luciana and Agustina. Have you met Agustina? -Cohen? -No, Chávez. Pili's friend. She opened a sort of gallery in Almagro. She publishes fanzines with Cecilia, where Carlos once published some poems. We met her at the reading in Panal. I know who she is, but she doesn't know me. Well, I don't know. What's up with...? Nothing. Hey! What's up? Caro, darling! What's up with you, girl? -Everything cool? -Cool. This is Julieta, we studied Literary Theory and Analysis together. How are you? I'll go get a beer in the kitchen. Sure. What's he doing here? Did he come here with his wife? His wife just gave birth. -What's he doing here? -Who knows? I'll be right back. What are you doing here? Who are these people? You know their names, their faces. Everybody is here. The one who published his first book, which was a hit, the artist who shows his work in a storehouse, the radio show hostess, the publisher of your novel, the girl who sings, the poet who teaches workshops, the bookstore owner, the art curator, the guy who wrote over 15 novels, the girl who won a prize and became best-seller, the girl who's dying to be published, but isn't, the filmmaker, the literary critic... It's got like a slime, that looks like detergent. It could also look like something else. Like what? That's when I think it becomes sexual, and you can't cut it... You've always been sure of one thing: you're nobody. You have a master in wasting time. This is not your voice. It's the copy of the voice of an American writer you discovered recently. You don't really have a voice. You're searching for it. You're choosing the words. Selecting images. You have the feeling that this unique instant is lost in the exact moment you're living it. That's why you write: you can't deal with loss. Your head is like a jar where you leave all those little things you don't want to throw away just in case: a screw, a nail, a take-away card... a dry marker without cap, a safety pin, buttons... Yeah? More than Kyoto? -Lau, would you pour me some rosé? -Sure. - It's chilled? -It's great, yes. -Here. -Thank you. How are you? Do you have a light? Sorry. So how are you? Terrible, and you? I'm doing pretty well. Why "terrible"? I almost called you on Saturday, but I remembered you had your daughter's birthday. What do they call it, slumber party? You should've called. I was at home and started to feel a pain in my chest. I thought I'd go by ER, get an ECG, they'd say I'm okay, and I'd be released in half an hour. About 8:30, I went to Pirovano Hospital. You know what time I left? At 7 AM the following morning. -What was wrong? -Nothing, I didn't have anything. You're on the edge, on the coast of an uncharted island. You're like a castaway dragged by the current with a bunch of objects you're going to recycle to survive. Blood pressure... I thought your plan was cooler than inviting me to the ER with you... Any plan would have been better than being at home with ten hysterical kids. -By myself. -Ten? The doctor saw me and made me go to a room... "Things that give a pathetic impression". A man talking without being heard. A woman who just wants to please a man who barely notices her. -Thank you. -You're welcome. So what did they say? Do you get it? They gave me oxygen. But what was it? A panic attack? It was nothing. I mean, the exams were perfect. Muscular pain, or not even that. A mystery. And Patricia? Patricia... is in Planet Baby. She doesn't see anything. Call me next time, we'll go out. I was saying. We can go out for a drink, eat something. Yeah? Well, I think I will call it a night. Are you leaving? I shouldn't even be here. Your mind works out of sync. You get your hopes up, you dream. It's your childish spirit. You've got a doll's house in your head. Juli, Juli! -Hey! -Hey! -How are you? -Long time no see! I didn't know you knew Java. From elementary school. I hadn't seen her in a long time. Yes. I was kind of bored, and I wanted to go get some wine. Do you want anything? Whisky. No, I can't drink that. I'm kidding. -But red wine, white, something. -Yes, whatever. Wait here. Big? Small? I wrote a review. -About what? -Your novel. I read it and wrote a review. -Really? -Yes, it really got me thinking... -Thinking about...? -Many things. You're trying to be honest. You're trying to tell the truth with lies. You are where you always wanted to be, but you want to run away. They split up, and she got back with a guy... -Caro, we're leaving. -Oh, no, stay. I've got to work tomorrow. Wait, I'll bring the cake. Hold on, please. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Words melt like fake snowflakes in a glass replica. You need to shake the miniature winter to create the illusion of a landscape. -Three wishes. -Yes. You can't say what it is. Where now? When now? Go on. Who now? Thank you, honey! -Do you want the strawberry? -No. I love a stranger Since today, since yesterday From the sky to the subways I love the strange, no reason why I won't do good, I'll do no harm I don't want to ruin it, do it again I don't want to see you again From many years ago From a train to another From a king to a worker In strangers I can find, I can see The glow of imaginary No, don't look for me, I won't be there I don't want to see you again Leave me, understand me There's nothing planned I want to do I have surrendered to a love Without you Without face, without religion I don't want to know you Don't tell me your name I won't be there I have surrendered to a love Without you No, don't look for me I won't be there I don't want to see you again Leave me, understand me There's nothing planned I want to do I have surrendered to a love Without you Without a face, without religion I don't want to know you Don't tell me your name I won't be there I have surrendered to a love Without you CHAPTER 4 -Would you read Actress? -Yes. Would you read Santos? And you're Director. And María Luisa... Would you read it, Cynthia? Of course, my pleasure. Very well. Do you need anything else to begin? Yes. I'll read this. Is this part of the play? No. Well, I don't know, I don't think so. It's like those quotes before the book begins, like inspirational quotes. -The epigraph. -Yeah, they would be epigraphs. But they could not be there. Okay, let's begin. Are we ready? Go on, read. "The camera is an instrument that teaches people to see when there is no camera." Dorothea Lange. "Yes, girls in the afternoon, children in the gardens, landscapes that sound like perfect melodies, verses from Rilke or Brooke, generous enthusiasm of the young souls that can change the world, the beauty of sacrifice and idealism, and love, and son, and friendship, but what about the black void, the flashing shiver of the abyss?" Juan L. Ortiz, Water goes up. Four. "Fauna." First rehearsal. Santos and Julia are doing the scene of the reunion with amnesia. María Luisa and José Luis look at them. You are José Luis, the director. And the actress is called Julia. I'll start. I don't want to be rude, but I honestly tell you I don't know what you're talking about. Fauna, it's me. You look like a good man, but, please, don't insist. I don't know Fauna. My name is Martina Céspedes, and I haven't seen you, sir, in all my life. I don't understand why you torture me like that, Fauna. I've already apologized. Sir, if you don't leave, I'll have to ask the concierge to make you leave by force. Fauna, please, forgive me. Do it for the love you once felt for me. Please, don't be ridiculous. What love are you talking about? I wish, love, how pompous! Fauna, it's me. What happened to you? What have they done to you? Sir, please, I'm asking you. Cut, cut. Very well, Santos, it's going well, thank you. Julia, listen, you have to accumulate, or it's like a neverending story that doesn't accumulate, understand? The guy is desperate, because he doesn't understand if she's lying or not. In fact, it's something that was never proved. Exactly. So you have to act that, that ambiguity, do you understand? You have to make us and him doubt if you really have amnesia or if you're just trying to get revenge. I'm not saying it's easy. I imagine something like... José Luis sets to act a part of the scene with Santos, who gets uncomfortable. What does he say? Give me a cue. Santos doesn't react. Say some line. Which? Maybe from "Do it for the love you once felt for me." Yes, let's take it from there. Say that line. Fauna, please, forgive me. Do it for the love you once felt for me. Please, don't be ridiculous. What love are you talking about? I wish, love, how pompous! Fauna, it's me. What happened to you? What have they done to you? Sir, please, I'm asking you. If you insist on denying me, I'll have to kidnap you. I say there's a click there. We should see she understands or remembers something, even if it's a subtle glow. But we hadn't got to that part yet, you cut me before. Yeah? Anyway, it needed more accumulation. Let's go again. The director does it well, huh? Why don't you read it once so Santos can watch it and learn? Sorry, can I say something? I like the scene, I think it's powerful by itself, but thinking about the movie, I don't understand why we chose to tell such a weird moment in the life of Fauna, a moment that's clearly sad and traumatic, that shows her weak and confused. José, I don't mean to discredit you, but wouldn't it be better to tell when she starts dressing as a man and she gets in the circles of poets and becomes Fauno? That could be good, too. Because I think this story is beautiful and full of sadness, and I thank Luisa for having told it to us, and I think it's very useful for all of us to know it, but I wouldn't use it to build the character of Fauno. I think it doesn't do it justice. Excuse me, in any case, it shows her vulnerable, which she was, not weak. That's what I like about this episode. But she was 15 years old, José Luis. Exactly, a foundational story. One that she never wanted to tell again, isn't that so, María Luisa? We should respect that. As if there weren't stories to choose from Fauno's life. We could make a six-hour long movie if we wanted. It's a story her mom wrote. What? The amnesia episode, it's a story, she told it to me as a story. That's in her notebooks of recovery. Have you read those notebooks? No, but they exist. Who says so? Mamina. It's a story, I tell you, it's a lie. Anyhow, it's fine. Sorry to interrupt, but it's not that important if it was true or not for what we want to do. What do you mean? To me, it's essential. Since when? Since when? Since always. What are you talking about, Julia? To me, it's not the same if it's something that happened to me or something I wrote. Maybe it's something that happened to me, but as it was an episode of amnesia, I don't remember it, and somebody told it to me, and since I am ashamed, I can only get close to that pain through fiction, through fictional creation. Something mysterious is going on. Santos and María Luisa stare at her as if Fauna had become present, and José Luis is a little frightened. I think it's best if we call it a day and let's resume at some other time. I'm exhausted. I buried two horses today. One. I buried Laica. The horses thing is about a previous scene. Both men buried some horses that belonged to Santos that died because they were stung by bees. Very well. Let's move forward with the next one. Shall we read? Yes. I still don't know where this one will go. There must be something between the previous one and this one, but I'm not sure. Okay. Let's read. Six. Confused people are dangerous. The four rehearse the scene of Fauna's confession in the circle of poets. And why do you want to be my mother? I don't want to be your mother, I want to tell the story of your mother. What story? What do you mean? The story of her life. Her life, not a story, then. One of her stories. No, of course, her life. Yes. Why? Because I find it fascinating. And I think many others might be interested as well, I want to make this movie so more people can get to know her. -Who? -Your mother. Mom is dead. Yes, I know, that's why. Yes. Let's do it again. Yes. You begin. "Excuse me, good man." Yes. Excuse me, good man. I wouldn't like to bother you, my dear friend, but I couldn't help noticing that forces I can't begin to name combine within you. I don't know what you mean, my dearest friend. Please, don't take offense at my audacity. Of course not, be confident, talk. Very well, my blessed friend, be loyal and excuse my blunder, but I'm acting for your good. I don't want to waste your time, but, believe me, I don't know how to act. Friend... Dearest friend, I'm in love with you. Santos kisses her. He stops reading, it looks like he's improvising. Julia is startled. What do you find so threatening? What? Why do you feel so threatened? Threatened? I don't know, it's nothing. -Yes. -Yes what? You've got something. Julia hugs him. Don't worry, my friend, you won't have nothing to fear by my side. Be careful, Santos, the girl is confused, and confused people are dangerous. Yes? Luisa, do you feel that running away, running from others, from other, is an act of cowardice or of courage? Are you talking about the girl? No, I'm talking about us, here. Running from the encounter? -Yes. -I don't know. It depends on what you expect, or what you yearn for. Fauna wouldn't be Fauno if she had shared her life. That's clear. But does that make her brave or the opposite? How can a woman do what she has to do and on top of that be a woman? I don't understand. Is that poetry? Is that from Fauna? No! It's mine. I wonder what makes a woman complete. Having children, deciding not to have them, because she can, I mean, she can have them, and she decides not to? Why can't a woman have a child away from her body, without knowing? Why does the woman always, inevitably, have to know? How can I be an actress and work with my body and also be a mother, how? How do I offer my body to more than one thing, how do I split myself? If I already split myself all the time, but in another being, in another living being... How can I not be selfish being a mother or not being one, deciding not to ever be one? I want to be a father and conceive children away from me, children that I don't even know exist or that I do, but without seeing them all the time! What says that I am a woman, what makes me behave like this, so determined? Why that obsession of knowing and understanding, all the time, what is what, who makes whom? I can no longer respond to that construction of weakness. I also feel weak. Do you want to make a movie about the woman? I wish I could be the father of my children. Fauna was a father to us. Can we try the confession scene with Fauno as himself? -Would you do that? -If you think it would help. Yes. You begin: "Excuse me, good man." Yes. Excuse me, good man. I wouldn't like to bother you, my dear friend, but I couldn't help noticing that forces I can't begin to name combine within you. I don't know what you mean, my dearest friend. Don't take offense at my audacity. Of course not, be confident, talk. Very well, my blessed friend, be loyal and excuse my blunder, but I'm acting for your good. I don't want to waste your time, but I don't know how to act. Friend... Dearest friend, I'm in love with you. José Luis kisses Santos. He hugs him. These texts are terrible. Who wrote them? Me. His Fauno is more feminine than mine. Well. Very well. You worked very well. Is this all you have? -Plus the scene you read the other day. -The one with the horses. -The one with the horses, yes. -Good. And then there's another one that would go in the middle, and I have an idea of the end, of what could happen, but I'm not sure, so I wanted to see first what you thought about it. Very well. You worked very hard. Who goes first? Who goes first? Well... Who goes first at one, at two... Sole, do you want to go first? Okay, I go. First I wanted to tell you that I liked it, the characters are interesting. By the way, the readings were brilliant. Excellent. You did a very good casting, you've got your cast. Sorry, Sole, I interrupted. Go on. I was saying I liked the characters. Last time we didn't get to see the women, but now we did, and I love it. In general, I felt the rhythm was flowing, dialogues worked, though sometimes I didn't fully understand what was going on. They're rehearsing, right? Shall I explain it? No, only this, actually. For moments, they're rehearsing, right? Right. They're rehearsing some texts he wrote. These older texts, as if it was a period play. I understood that, but sometimes that fiction is interrupted. I mean, the rehearsal. That fiction within the play. Yeah, in fact... Let's hear the rest. What did you see? Sole, are you done? I wanted to add that I think the dialogues move smoothly, and I'm interested in these layers, the theater within the theater... What you're writing is a play, isn't it? It's the idea, yes. Just that. Honestly I love it, I think it's going very well. I'd like to know more about the characters, what they're doing there, what it is they're rehearsing, to understand it more clearly. But I like what we have so far, I'm interested, I want more. -Thank you. -Very well. I just wanted to add, based on what she said, that I'm writing a play, but in the play, the characters are rehearsing for a movie they want to shoot. I'm not sure the idea gets across. Well, yes, don't explain. Let's see what the others saw. I don't know if you were finished, Sole, sorry. -Yes. -Okay, well. Who's next? Camilo? I agree with Sole, I think the dialogues are fine, they run smoothly. I don't visualize where they are, I don't know if it's some kind of abstract place, or do you have a fantasy of where this takes place? No, it's at the siblings' house, Santos' and María Luisa's. Oh, so they're siblings. I didn't get that. It's not explicit in this part. That's in a different scene. I don't think I read the previous part. Santos and María Luisa are Fauna's children. -Right? -Yes. -Isn't she Fauna? -No. No, of course, her character is Julia, the actress. I'm lost. Who is Fauna? -Shall I explain? -No. Let's hear the rest. María Luisa and Santos are Fauna's children who live in the jungle. -Is that right? -Yes. Yes, in the Littoral. Well, it's the jungle, too. It's the same. And these two people from the city come to make a movie about their mom. Am I right? That's right. We need to read the previous scenes. What were you saying, Camilo? Reading these scenes, I don't get that about the Littoral. I don't know if it's important, I'm just saying what I felt. Anyway, I don't think it's a problem if it's suspended in a no-place, or an abstract place. I don't know how attached you are to this Littoral image, but I think it could work in another space, too. Yes, pretty attached. And I agree with Sole. I'd like to know more about these characters. Who are they? Who is this actress, this director? What kind of people are they? -Very well. Anything else? -Just one thing. Is it possible there's some tension between them? It's not explicit, but they're always competing, or mistreating each other. Yes. The idea is they're lovers. They just broke up. So there's this tension all the time. He used to mistreat her, she got tired of it, and now she's fascinated with these siblings she met, with Fauna's world. But did Fauna exist? Yes. Well, in the reality of the play, she did. She was their mother. No, I mean the real reality, this, ours. Not in this one, no. She might have existed, but anyway this is fiction. Yes, as far as I know. Very well. Anything else? No? Then I go. First, I want to congratulate you because you worked very well. I know it sounds schoolish to congratulate, but it's important to say it, because you worked very well, and you're going to a good place. The other day, when we read the other scene, you told me you wanted to write a play where a play was being rehearsed... A movie. Okay, but here, when they rehearse for the movie, they're not in front of a camera, so it's like a theatrical rehearsal. Honestly, I thought it was difficult or I thought it was pretentious. I couldn't see it. But as I was reading it, it's clear, you see it in the scenes. Dialogues flow, and somehow it becomes clear, for instance, through the character of Santos, who starts to blur the difference between reality and fiction, or the actress, who becomes more and more raptured by the presence of Fauna, and that allows her to liberate areas within herself she wouldn't otherwise allow to liberate. As if characters were grounded in a sort of unconscious territory, and that's a territory where they all converge, as a no linear space, a space with no time, I thought, from the material. That, on the one hand. On the other hand, I think it's important to resume what Sole was saying about the idea of the theater within the theater, and in that sense I think of Calderón, Shakespeare. I think in Arlt, too, of course. It's a classic topic. You know that, don't you? Since the Renaissance, baroque in the theater, at least, is associated to the idea of truth. I mean, Hamlet, which is the emblematic play about this. Hamlet writes a play within a play to figure out his father's assassination. In the play he writes, called "The Mousetrap," Hamlet writes that a king is assassinated by his brother to marry the queen and get the kingdom. The same story as Hamlet, but smaller. A mise en abyme of Hamlet's story. But when he's preparing the play, Hamlet says, "The play's the rope wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king." And there he establishes, I think, a relation of this I'm saying about truth and fiction. Or also about dream and wakefulness. What comes first? What is life? An illusion, a shadow, a fiction... Calderón. It's not the same topic, but when Hamlet writes the play, he says, "the play's the rope wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king." That phrase gives me the idea of fiction as an access to truth. We can find that idea throughout the history of literature. And I can think, closer to us, for instance, when Piglia recovers Lacan to think fiction. I don't know if Piglia recovers him, but Lacan is severe and he says, "Truth has the structure of fiction." That's where I get this notion of fiction as a way to access truth. UNLIMITED EDITION
