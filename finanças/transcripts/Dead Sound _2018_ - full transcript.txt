(liquid pours) (clink) ¶ ¶ ¶ Block Island, baby! Yeah! Let's go! It's on man. I got it, I got it. So what'd you do in rehab Ashley? Smoked cigarettes. Practiced mindfulness. Oh you don't mind, do you? Hey no need to flaunt that in her face Nicky. What? No, I don't mind. Alright how far to the ferry? About twenty minutes if we're lucky. But we're cutting it close. Alright, Big Man pull over, I gotta take a leak. No way. Dude, come on, I gotta go. You want to get to this party tonight or not? Ashley, give me an empty beer can. Please, thank you. That's right. Turn that way when you do it. Whoa! Get your loafer off me man. You watch that Big Man, alright. Careful Duker. You dribble one drop in my Dad's car I'm going to give you a beat down. Hey relax, I've got pin point accuracy. Disgusting. Ah, yeah. ¶ ¶ ¶ Oh come on, come on, come on. Dude! Is there another boat? The next one leaves tomorrow morning. Wait so that's it? I don't understand. How can they just leave without us? Way to go, Big Man. How we supposed to get to the party now? How is this my fault? You drive like my grandmother, who's dead! You're dead! You can find a way to get us to Block Island tonight, right Jake? Yeah man, this is life or death. Shut up! I'll call Harry, maybe he can find us a ride on his boat. ¶ ¶ ¶ (Phone ringing) Hello. Harley boy! You on the slow boat? What? I can't hear you man. Here, listen to this party stuff. Just a quick flash. Just show me. Yes, aw titties! No... Gosh! Hang on a sec Jake, I gotta refill my glass. Okay no one look, I have to put in my secret ingredient on my signature drink: Harry's High Tide. Elvis, throw me that kiwi, yeah? Thanks, hound dog. And get ready to straddle. Okay, three, two, one, okay. Everything okay Baker? Anything you need, just, just help yourself. Hey thanks Harry, this has been amazing but I gotta get back to work. So do me a favor just keep the noise level down. I don't want to have to deal with your annoying neighbors, okay. Okay, thanks man. Who's got my handcuffs? Harry? Yo. Sorry about that. There's a girl in a bikini doing back-flips across the backyard for you. We're still in New London, The ferry left without us. Not your best move Harley. We know. So, uh, what are you going to do? Well it's funny you should ask. We were actually hoping that, maybe you could hop in your boat and come pick us up? Ah, Jake. You know you're my boy, I mean, no one wants to see you here more than me, but I'm already deep into some High Tides, and my buzz is way too large for me to handle a mish, a misha, mission like that. We got no other way over there tonight, Harry. I hear you brother but it looks like you're gonna have to get creative. Check the docks. I've hitched rides from hedge fund guys on their yachts a few times before. If not the docks, check with one of the locals. Harry? Hi baby. Good luck brother. Call me when you get there. What's that sweetheart? Great! This place is dead. Where are those hedge fund yachts Harry was talking about? I'm sure this is where all the hitters park their boats. I got Fireball... Screw this. Where you going? Going to salvage this situation. Hey Big Boy! Boys? Boys! Gotta love New London hookers! Hoookaaahhhs! Hey guys! Harry said we should ask some locals. Local hookers! I don't want any incidents! I know but he hasn't called. You know what I mean. Guess who's always getting whacked, you. So that's what's keeping him. (laughing) Look at this place Big Man. Maybe we can still get to that party tonight after all. What do you mean? Well I'm sure one of these locals has a boat we can charter. Throw some green, become heroes of the working class, no? Try not to think too much. What kind of beer you got here? The usual. I'll take two of those. You're in my seat. Hey bartender, can I get um, can I get a pitcher of whatever you guys got, and let me get four shots of anything brown. Open up a tab for me boss. Cash only. Got it. We should probably head to the bar before those two burn it down. Sure you're ready for all this, Ash? Well my sponsor says I need to "assimilate" sooner or later. Just seems a little on the sooner side. Maybe you should worry about yourself. Ashley- No, I needed you that night Jake. I overreacted with your father. You attacked him. I wasn't thinking. You scared me, Jake. I'm sorry. That's not enough. Come on. You kids don't want to go in there. We've got friends in there. Don't say I didn't warn ya. Stay close. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Harley boy! Meet the girls. This is Nancy. Brandy. And this is Alexa. Hey, Harley boy. Where's Nicky? Said he's going to try and charter a boat or something. You can do this. Hey cutie. What's your story? Let's find Nicky and get out of here. You're crushing the mood here Jake. Yeah, don't do that. Let's crush something else. Have a beer and relax. I think you're hot. What's that? We can all go to my place. All four of us. Thanks for the invite. I don't want to be rude, but my friends and I are leaving. Is, is that your girlfriend? She's not all that, you know? Excuse me for a second. Whoa! What's your problem, man! Ooooh, What's wrong with you, Chester? Your name's Chester? He was all over my girl, Bobby. I think we all know it was the other way around. Why don't you go home and take a nap. Yo Chester, why don't you do us all a favor and go home and take a nap! Yeah Chester. Screw you Bobby. Screw all of you! Come on. Are you okay? I'm fine. Just took me by surprise. You're my boy! Clean hit. So good news Jake! Bobby here is first mate on a fishing boat, says he can get us to Block Island, tonight. Surprised you didn't give Chester a beat down after he took that free shot on you. I would've put him in the ground. I could tell you wanted to do the same. My man. Never second guess yourself. You know where you're going? Yeah, last slip on the dock, north side. Boat leaves in thirty. Later soon, amigos. Yes. We got a boat! Let's go. Now that is what I'm talking about. We needed a ride, so I got us a ride. It's called initiative, playa. I don't like this guy Bobby. Would you stop overreacting? Seriously. I am not spending a night in this black hole of a town. I want sex, not bed bugs. Yeah well good luck with that. Cause Ashley and I are staying here. What? Did that meat stick jar your brain? Dude if it were just the three of us that would be one thing but I'm not putting Ashley on that guy's boat, at night, in the middle of Long Island Sound. Hey Jake, I paid this guy four hundred bucks. If you don't want to go? That's fine don't go. I'll have plenty of stories for you on Monday. Maybe Harley's got a point, Nicky. Bobby does seem a little sketchy. Alright shut up. I don't want to miss another boat cause of you. Hope you had your shots. I can't believe that thing even floats. Looks like a dinghy I rowed in on when I shipwrecked off Nantucket two summers ago. I remember that dinghy. Okay, let's do this. Hello? You can't be serious. This is not what Harry meant when he said we could find a ride over. Officially done talking about this Jake. Hello? Who are you? It's my boat. Who the fuck are you? Ah well, it's, it's a, it's a very good boat. It looks uh, looks sea worthy. Is Bobby here? He told us he'd give us a ride to Block Island tonight. Cool knife... old. They're okay Cap. I'll vouch for 'em. That's my boy Nicky. They paid, Stoney. All we have to do is get them to a party tonight on Block Island. Oh, why didn't you say so. But they have to ask nicely. And not this one. I know him two minutes already I don't like him. Sir, uh, we'd really appreciate it if you could give us a ride to Block Island tonight. You'd really help us out? Brains and beauty. Get the lines. Climb aboard. Well done Nicky! Ashley. All clear Stoney! Harley, you coming or what? Yeah donkey, get on the boat. Come on Jake! ¶ ¶ ¶ Cooler full of beers. Compliments of the house. More beer! Thanks Bobby! Great taste in brand, old school man. Old school. Right. Block Island here we come! Hi, this is Harry Fellows, leave a message and call me whatever you want, Hey Harry, it's Harley. We caught a ride over with some fishermen who are... Well, I have, let's just say I have a bad feeling about them. Listen, if you don't see us in a couple hours send the cavalry. Who wants a Harry's High Tide? What's in it? Oh, well, that's a secret. Mmm, that right? Vodka and hot sauce. The rest is escaping me at the moment because you're so beautiful, cutie. Ki... kiwi. It was kiwi. Reloading. Anyone need one? I'll take another brew-dogger. Whoa. Take it easy big guy. Someone's been over-served. I could kill like thirty beers and not even feel it. Beer. Dude. I wasn't ready for that. Not my fault. You need, (burps) faster reflexes. Well you just wasted a beer. You okay man? Yeah, I was just a little sea sick. Hey now that you're done feeding the fishes, you want to try getting me another beer. You're such a jerk Nicky. Hey there he is! Bobby baby, come smoke this joint with us, man. Not bad. Where'd you get it? My boy in the Big Apple. We had weed in prison, but not like this. Cool, man. Ashley, toss this bad boy a beer. Yeah, grab him a beer, Ashley. Sure. Thank you. You're welcome. She's quite the little biscuit isn't she Bobby? Oh come on Ashley. Show us all that tight little body of yours. Shut up Nicky. Well come on, Bobby wants to see it. She's got amazing boobies. Nicky! Knock it off. Well seriously man, Bobby's nice enough to give us a ride. Least we can do. Come on Ash, don't be a prude. Happy now? Yes, thank you. Triple A plus. What the hell, Ash? It was just a joke. Well, it's been real, I better get back to work. Thanks for the stuff. Yeah man. Anytime. Do you have a bathroom? Yeah, but that's below deck. so it's off-limits. Please? I really have to pee. Twist my arm. I'll take you down. Thanks! I'll come with you. Bobby can show me. You sure? She's sure. I'll be fine, Jake. How much longer you think until we get there? In this crap-box? Who knows. (Shouts) Hey Cappy! Who taught you how to drive a boat! Step on it, would ya! Stop provoking these guys. Not my fault Ashley has nice boobs. Right this way. Thanks. Oh, sorry, I didn't realize anyone else was down here. Ashley, meet Krista. Hi, nice to meet you. She doesn't say much. Bathroom's down there. Thanks. Great. Es questo un Cubano? Si. Took it from Carson Senior's humidor last night. Alright. You're not doing, what are you doing, you're not doing it right. You got to twist it. I am twisting it. You're terrible at this. Don't tell me how to light a cigar, Duker. I steal them from my dad all the time. What's the matter Jake? Is it Bobby? You got to let that jail-bird go man. He's fine. I'm worried about Ashley. I don't think she's ready for this and if anything happens at this party, like if she starts drinking. We're not her keeper Jake. Technically you two aren't even together anymore. You ever going to tell us what really happened between you two? The night before she was going to rehab I was staying at her house. She was all twisted about going. I was just trying to be supportive. I thought everything was going fine. We watched a movie in her room. I went down to get some ice cream, and when I came back up she was doing lines of heroin on her desk. Everyone's doing that drug now. I freaked out and told her to dump it in the toilet. That's when her dad came in, saw it, and started blaming me. He charged me, threw me up against the wall. I don't know, something in me just snapped. I don't remember how but I got him to the ground, started throwing punches until he went limp. Ashley was screaming these terrible blood curdling screams. So I bolted. Intense man. The worst part is I feel like I traumatized Ashley. It tore me up all year. All I wanted to do was see her and I couldn't. Her parents wouldn't let me talk to her obviously. I thought maybe on this trip I could but... I don't know, it's been a real game of inches, man. I feel you, Harley. That's why I never fall for the ladies when I hook up. As soon as you get wet, the head games begin. What? It's true. You're an idiot Carson. Oh sorry. Hope I'm not interrupting. Not at all. Why don't you stick around for a little while. So, do you guys actually live in here? Want a shot? Oh. No thanks. Nothing but the best around here. I just got out of rehab. Rehab's for quitters. Quitters and spitters. Is that...? It's just a little coke. Or I got heroin too, if that's more your speed. I better go upstairs. Don't be like that. You're a guest on my boat. I insist. No. I'm sober. Come on, get crazy with us. Yeah, I've seen what you got under that dress. Let's open that up. I wanna leave. I'm not stopping you. You're standing in my way. Am I? I don't. Sure you do. Don't fight it. I can tell you and Jake were a thing, right. Disappointed you huh. No. Yeah. I'd never do that. Disappoint you. I may not have much, but what I do have... She's feisty Bobby. I like that. Me too. Easy there Big Man! You almost got me. Screw you Skywalker! Come to the dark side! Why are we stopping? Ash, what's wrong? He tried to... I don't know. It was... Bobby? You stay down here, puppet. Hey Bobby, did you pull something down there? She should be flattered. She's not. Jake. Hey, Jake come on. Look Bobby, we're not accusing you of anything. No? That's what it sounds like. No, I'm sure there's just been a misunderstanding. Is that what this is? Yes. How much longer until we get to Block Island? Block Island? Hey, we have friends waiting for us. They know we're on your boat. Is that right? Yeah, they're waiting. You people don't like to wait, do you? No, we don't. So take us to Block Island. Or else... what, exactly? We just want you to take us to Block Island. Well maybe I want to renegotiate terms. Renegotiate? Yeah, I'm thinking I'm gonna need a another $400 to get you there and since you were so gung-ho about pimping out Ashley, Nicky, I'm thinking a threesome with her and my girl down below should square us away. Speaking of "down below", how's your grooming Ashley? Because I like 'em clean, shaved and tighter than a preschooler. C'mon Carson. Kick his ass Big Man. C'mon get in there. Carson get up. C'mon Carson. Whoa, easy there Jake. Step away from that harpoon. Too late for that now. I told you never to second guess yourself my man. Now look at ya. Everything good Bobby? Yeah under control Cap. This one just got excited. Needed a little adjustment. He's crazy! Why don't you all just sit down and try not to fulfill all my expectations. Get their phones. Phones. Now! I hate this vest. Why are you doing this? Because, we can. And because you were stupid enough to ask Bobby for a ride. I mean, look at him. Does he look like the kind of guy you can trust? Ooh, easy there Jake. Bobby, come on man. Come on, what? People saw us talking to you in the bar. The cops are going to come looking for you. You think anyone around here cares what happens to a bunch of rich kids like you? New London is my town. Those people are my people, all you do is come in here and piss all over it, all over them. You think anyone is going to lift a finger to make sure you kids are okay? I got news for ya. Most of them will sleep better at night knowing you're not. Fuck you!!! Ahhhhhhhhh! Oh my God! Carson! No! Carson. What the hell's the matter with you? Sorry, Cap. We're just supposed to rob them Bobby. Why is that gun even loaded? They were asking for it Stoney. Answer the question! Aren't you sick of this? I am, I'm sick of them, all of it! So what do you want to do? Not much choice now. Oh, chill with that Krista. We don't have to break out your Narcan again. What was that noise out there? Nothing. Tie him to a chair. What'd he do? Something someone gets tied to a chair for, just do it. You, down. Mouth, too? Yeah. Stuff him. Are you sure? His mouth is tweaking me something awful. Stop it! Leave him alone! She's a live one Jake. I bet she's great in the sack. Jake, Jake! Leave her alone! Better! Come here baby. Kiwi? Revs up your gut flora. So, Nicky the smart-ass. You a college boy? Your answers are going to matter here. Yes. I go to college. I'll bet your old man had to pull some serious strings to get a screw head like you into a good school. Not that you'd appreciate it. College is a flawed endeavor anyway, it's all about the past preparing you for the future, without being in the present. Hey man, do, do you want money to let us go? My dad is CEO of a bank. He'll give you whatever you want. I promise I won't say a word about any of this. Do you really think this is about money now? Bobby was right about one thing. I come from a long line of fishermen. My family had a house on Block Island as far back as 1920. That is until the bank took it. I'm sorry man. A bank just like your daddy's. Rich pigs like him came in and pushed my family out. No, no my family... The day they took my home, I heard one of those smug sons of demons say to the other, "Hey, where you want to have breakfast later?" End of my world. Life goes on, nothing personal. I've been forced to accept that as a natural order. The rich push the poor, think they can keep on pushing, always have in the past, always will in the future. Nothing personal, that's the way it is. But, just like you and your expensive schools, they don't see the present. They don't see their blood in the water. I do. I've watched and waited in the now for a long time, seeing the terrain, smelling the blood, itching for my moment to push back. My family doesn't even own a house on Block Island. We didn't do anything to you. You to need to adjust your expectations and get into the now. I live there and everything I need is right is here on this boat because of it. Out here is my sanctuary. My peace from your storm. You know, I'm one of the few fishermen left in this area who still makes a living at it. Everyone else has been starved out. I'm a dying breed. We have that in common, you and me. You don't know it, but your time is just about up. And when it is, life will go on and one of us will have breakfast. Please, I don't have an issue with you, I know you didn't want this. That's true enough. I did not want to be here. But here is where I am. This isn't you. It's Bobby, you know that. Bo, Bobby is the problem. Is that right, you don't like Bobby? He's an animal! I'd be careful what I say about him if I were you. The way I hear him tell it, he liked boys just like you in prison. He should be shot! You see that scruff Nicky? That's called prison pussy. Please. Don't beg. Come on man you're making me feel bad. Hell, you know what? I'm going to help you out. Do you want to get Bobby back for killing your friend? Hey! Hey! Hey! Get out of your head, into the now. Do you want to get Bobby back? Now's your chance. Shut up. You got us into this mess. What's it going to be smart-ass? The moment is yours. You gonna push? I didn't think you had it in you, good for you. Get him up. Get up. I'm going to take you to my favorite spot in the ocean, and since it'll be the last thing you ever see, because you just impressed me, I'm going to let you pilot the boat. Please. You have to help us. What is wrong with you? Let me out of here! See Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Where to? The Race. That current's gonna love you so much it's never going to let you go. Eyes front. I'll be right back. Take care of them now, please. Just a little fun first. No, fun is over Bobby. See land. Do you see those lights out there? What are we going to do? We can swim for it. Looks about a half mile away. What about Nicky? We can't just leave him here with those guys. They've got him. We got to get off the boat and get help. It's the only way to save him and ourselves. We got to jump. You ready? What the hell happened? I couldn't help it Bobby, they got away. You had one job to do! It's freezing. Start swimming it will warm you up. They got away. What do you mean? They must have jumped off, tried to swim for it. They can't be far. Bring her around. We're going fishing. I can't either. It's too far. Yes you can. Yes you can. You see that lighthouse over there? That's where we're going, just stay with me okay. Come on Ash. Keep swimming. I can't. Please, Ash they're coming. Jake, I can't swim anymore. Go on without me. No. A boat's coming, just hang on. Are we going to die, Jake? We're not going to die. Listen to me. Ashley. Pay attention. Just look at me. I'm going to think of something, okay. Do you trust me? I trust you. I love you. I love you too. HELP! We're over here. Help! Help! Got 'em Stoney! Dead ahead! Yeah I see. Ah look, I caught me a pretty one! Now that's a keeper. What do you want to do about Jake? Up to you! Let's run him down! What? No! No, no, no you can't do this. I can do whatever I want. Jake! Hey! Come back. Go straight for him now, you hear me? Don't stop. Don't do this to him please. He's my best friend! You steer that wheel an inch in either direction, I blow your brains all over it. Understand? Huh!! Jake! Portside Stoney. Oh my God! That's it Jake! Swim for it! You can't do this. Nowhere to go! Hahaha! No! You just stop the boat. Good boy. That's it. Please no. Please! Jake! Jake! You son of a bitch!! Jake! Carson! Carson! Do something about her, will you Bobby. Nice work Stoney. You figured out a way to shut him up. Whoa!! Where you going sweetheart? Nicky. Nicky please! Rebutle. Watch. Now watch. This is how it's done. Any of you guys seen Jake Harley? I just listened to a message from him and he said he got a ride from some fishermen from New London. So? That was over four hours ago. He should have been here by now. Dude, he probably got trashed and ended up in a bar in Old Harbor. He would have texted me. We have to go and find him ourselves. A rescue mission. Who's in? I'm coming! I'm coming. No way. You're too drunk. Dude, Jake's my best friend. Okay you can come. What's that? My Dad's rifle. Just in case. For protection. Oh, we forgot snacks. Get up. We got work to do. Get up. Throw that piece of meat overboard. He's stinking up my boat. Help her out smart-ass. Go on, pick him up. Is he dead? What are you doing out here? I told you to stay down below. You didn't say anyone was going to die Bobby. Bobby all respect, shut her blow hole or I'll shut it for you. He's too heavy, I can't. Looks like smart-ass can't pull his weight around here Cap. I guess he needs a little extra motivation. No, no, we can do this. We can do this. Nicky, you have to help me okay? Please. It's Carson! They did this to him! I know. I know. But it's like we're burying him, okay. That's it. A burial at sea for the Big Man. Come on. Anybody have any final words for the dear, dumb-ass dead departed? Sorry Big Man. It was all my fault. Love you, Carson. Personally I thought he was a pussy. Well it's not really a party until a rich prick falls in the drink. Both of you. Down below. You too. ¶ ¶ ¶ Hey, how we supposed to find them? Look at him crawling around like a lobster, Krista. Crawl! Crawl! Crawl! Crawl lobster, crawl like a little lobster that you are. C'mon crawl, crawl, crawl. Stop it! Leave him alone! Say, "I'm a lobster." Say, "I'm a lobster!" I'm a lobster! Not to me. To the lobster. I'm a lobster! Louder! I'm a lobster! I'm a lobster! I'm a lobster! I'm a lobster! I'm a lobster! I'm a lobster! Yeah you're a lobster. He likes you, he likes you. Look, he thinks you're cute. Give him a little kiss. Little kiss. No please, no, no, no. You don't like the little lobster boyfriend. You don't like it? You don't like it? Then shut up. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! I think it's time to have a little party now. No Bobby, don't do it. Shut up, lobster! Fire! Over there! Please! I can't! Help me. Oh, oh, that's right, I remember when your face lit up when Krista mentioned heroin. That's your drug, isn't it? No, please. No stop it. This is called Steel Cake. And you're going to snort it. Bobby! She can't snort all that. Shut up! Not enough of a choice? How's this. Get off of her. Now, you can snort this, or you can suffocate. Again. Ashley! Ashley! She's overdosing. We have to help her! No we don't. You're a bastard! Yeah. I am. Krista give me the gun. Krista! I was saving you for last. All good things... Stone? Stoney you up there? Stone's dead. Jakey? That you? Back from the dead? Get up. I got smart-ass here, Jake! I'm gonna put a couple holes in him! Your girl is ODing on heroin. Back to her old ways. Stone? C'mon Ashley. Hey! Wake up! Wake up Ashley. Wake up. Ashley, wake up. Here. Give her this. What is that? It's Narcan. Spray it in her nose and it counter-acts the opiates. Okay. Just spray. Go ahead. Okay. Now let's get her on her side. Thank God! Ashley, hey, you're okay. You're okay. Jake? I'm here. I'm here. Hang tight. I gotta get Nicky. Thank you. Nicky? Good night Jake. That guy's shooting at us! We have to call the police! Harry Fellows to Block Island Police! Come in. I can't get a clear shot! Say goodnight Jakey. No! Don't shoot him! Is everybody coming back from the dead tonight? Bobby please, I will do anything! Well Jake I think I have one more thing I want you to see before you die. Admit it. You want this. I don't like you anymore Bobby. You know why you second guess yourself Jake? Because you're a killer, I can see it in your eyes. You're a killer just like me only it scares you. But second guessing isn't gonna change who you are. It's just going to be the edge I need to kill you. Shoot him! What? You can't shoot me! I'm invincible! Hey Bobby! Killer. I see you killer. I see you. We need to get every one off this boat. Now! Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. ¶ ¶ ¶
