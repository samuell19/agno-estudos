Oh... Oh-ho. Whoo. Oh. Whoo. All right, Curly, enough's enough. You can't eat the Venetian blinds. I just had them installed on Wednesday. Whoo. Down the hatch. Oh. She's no good. What can I say? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right. I'll pay you the rest next week. We only caught 60 ton of skipjack. They don't pay for skipjack as they do albacore. Forget it, Curly. I was only illustrating a point. I don't want your last dime. Who do you think I am? Thank you, Mr Gittes. Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curl, huh? A Mrs Mulwray's waiting for you with Mr Walsh and Mr Duffy. Mrs Mulwray, may I present Mr Gittes. Mrs Mulwray, how do you do? Mr Gittes. Now, what seems to be the problem? My husband, I believe, is seeing another woman. No. Really? I'm afraid so. I am sorry. Mr Gittes, please, could we discuss this alone? I'm afraid not, Mrs Mulwray. These are my operatives. At some point, they'll have to assist me. I can't do everything myself. Of course not. Now... what makes you certain that your husband is... involved with someone? A wife can tell. Mrs Mulwray, do you love your husband? Yes, of course. Then go home and forget everything. I'm sure he loves you, too, Mrs Mulwray. Do you know the expression "Let sleeping dogs lie"? You're... you're better off not knowing. I have to know. Very well. What is your husband's first name? Hollis. Hollis Mulwray. Water and Power? He's chief engineer. Chief engineer? Mrs Mulwray, this... this type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook. It takes time... Money doesn't matter to me, Mr Gittes. Ok., we'll... we'll see what we can do. Gentlemen, today you can walk out that door, hop a streetcar, and within 25 minutes end up in the Pacific Ocean. You can swim and fish in it, but you can't drink it, and you can't irrigate an orange grove with it. Now remember, we live next door to the ocean, but we also live next to a desert. Los Angeles is a desert community. Beneath this building, beneath our streets is a desert. Without water, the dust will rise and cover us as though we never existed. Now, the Alto Vallejo can save us from this, and I respectfully suggest that $8.5 million is a fair price to pay to keep the desert from our streets and not on top of them. Mayor Bagby, let's hear from all the departments again. I suppose we'd better take Water and Power first. Mr Mulwray? In case you've forgotten, gentlemen, over 500 lives were lost when the Van der Lip Dam gave way. Core samples have shown that beneath this bedrock is shale similar to the permeable shale in the Van der Lip disaster. It couldn't withstand that kind of pressure. Now you propose yet another dirt-banked terminus dam with slopes of 21/2 to 1, 112 feet high, and a 12,000-acre water surface. Well, it won't hold. I won't build it. It's that simple. I'm not going to make the same mistake twice. - Boo. - Boo. - Boo. - Boo. Quiet. Quiet. What the hell are you doing? Get those goddamn things out of here. Where should I take them? You don't have an answer for that so quick, do you? You steal water from the valley, ruin the grazing, starve the livestock. Who's paying you to do that, Mr Mulwray? That's what I want to know. ♪ I've flown around the world ♪ ♪ In a plane ♪ ♪ I've settled revolutions in Spain ♪ ♪ And the North Pole I have charted ♪ ♪ Still I can't get started ♪ ♪ With you ♪ ♪ On the golf course ♪ ♪ I'm under par ♪ ♪ Metro-Goldwyn ♪ ♪ Have asked me to star ♪ Jeez, he was there all night. That's right. I had to go back three times to pick up the watches. Yesterday he went to three reservoirs, a men's room at a Richfield gas station, and the Pig 'n Whistle. The guy's got water on the brain. So what do you got? This? They argued outside the Pig 'n Whistle. What about? I don't know. The traffic was loud. I heard only one thing, though... "apple core". "Apple core"? Yeah. Walsh, is that what you spent your day doing? You tell me to take pictures, I take pictures. Let me explain something to you, Walsh. J.J. Gittes and Associates. This business requires a certain amount of finesse. What is it, Sophie? Duffy's on the phone. Duff, where are you? I got it. He's found himself some cute twist. Slow down. Where are you? I'm at Glendale and Douglas. They're in Echo Park in a rowboat. A rowboat. Ok. Echo Park. Water again. Ok., pal, let's have us a big smile. You'll love it. Do not look behind. Cover your eyes. Do you like? You're pretty. Oh, here. Let me... When you get so much publicity, you got to get blasé about it. Let's face it, Jake, you're practically a movie star. Look at that, Barn. Yeah, the heat's murder. Sure is. Fools' names and fools' faces. What's that, pal? Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living. Oh? What do you do to make ends meet? Mortgage department, First National Bank. Tell me, did you foreclose on many families this week? We don't publish a record in the paper. Neither do I. No, your press agent does it. Who is this bimbo, Barney? Is he a regular customer or what? I make an honest living. People come to me when they're desperate. I don't kick families out of their houses like you bums at the bank do. Maybe you'd like to go outside and discuss it. What do you think? I don't know how it got in the newspaper. It was so quick, I didn't know it myself. Make an honest living. Of course you do. Anyway, this guy got tired of screwing his wife... An honest living, understand? Do what the Chinese do. He says, "What's that?" The Chinese screw a little... Duffy. Hey, Walsh. Sophie, go to the little girl's room, Ok? But, Mr Gittes... Sophie... Yes, Mr Gittes. I want to tell you a story. There's this guy, Walsh, understand? He's tired of screwing his wife. Jake... You're always in such a hurry. So his friend says, "Do it like the Chinese do." How do the Chinese do it? The guy says, "First they screw a little, "then they stop and read a little Confucius. Then they screw a little more, then stop again..." Jake. Walsh, just listen to me for a second. I mean, you'll love this. "Then they screw a little more, then they contemplate the moon or something..." Makes it more exciting. Now the guy goes home and starts screwing his own wife. He screws a little, then stops. He goes and reads Life magazine, then he returns and starts screwing again. He says, "Excuse me, honey," and smokes a cigarette. Now his wife is getting sore. He comes back, starts screwing again, gets up to leave again. She says, "What's the matter?" You're screwing just like a Chinaman." Jesus. That Barney. Mr Gittes. Yes. Do you know me? Well... I think I would have remembered. Have we ever met? Well, no. Never? Never. That's what I thought. You see, I'm Mrs Evelyn Mulwray, Mr Mulwray's wife. Not... that Mulwray? Yes, Mr Gittes, that Mulwray. And since you agree with me that we've never met before, you must also agree that I've never hired you, certainly not to spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr Gittes. Well, you're going to get it. Wait a minute, Mrs Mulwray. There's been some misunderstanding here. There's no point in getting tough... I don't get tough with anyone, Mr Gittes. My lawyer does. Here's something for you, Mr Gittes. I suppose we'll be hearing from your attorney. Mr Mulwray. He's not in, Mr Gittes. What is this regarding? It's a personal matter. Has he been gone long? Since lunch. Gee whiz, and I'm late. He was expecting you? 15 minutes ago. I'll just go in and wait. Sir? Is Mr Yelburton there? He's still in the building? Very well. Thank you. Can I help you? Russ Yelburton, deputy chief of the department. J.J. Gittes. It's not a departmental matter, Mr Yelburton. Would you care to wait in my office? Certainly. We're nervous around here with all this business in the papers about Mr Mulwray. Right this way. After you've worked with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know his habits, his values. You come to know him. Either he's the kind who chases women or he isn't. And Mulwray isn't? He never even kids about it. Well, maybe he takes it very seriously. Sit down. No, thank you. Do you know where Mulwray's having lunch? No, I'm sorry, I don't. Well, tell him I'll be back. I will. Do you mind if I take your card? In case I need you again. No, help yourself. Mulvihill, what are you doing here? They shut my water off. How'd you find out about it? You don't drink it. You don't take a bath in it. They wrote you a letter. But then you'd have to be able to read. Relax, Mulvihill. Glad to see you. You know Claude Mulvihill here? I hope so. He's working for us. Doing what? There have been some threats to blow up the city reservoirs. Any particular reason? It's this drought. We rationed water in the valley. The farmers are desperate, but the city needs drinking water. Well, you're in luck, Mr Yelburton. How's that? When Mulvihill was sheriff of Ventura County, the rum runners landed tons of booze on the beach and never lost a drop. He ought to hold on to your water for you. J.J. Gittes to see Mr Mulwray. Please. You wait. Oh. Heh. Bad for glass. Yeah, sure. Bad for the glass. Mr Gittes. Actually, I came to see your husband, Mrs Mulwray. Would you like something to drink? What are you having? Iced tea. That'll be fine, thank you. Two iced teas, Khan, please? Yes, ma'am. My husband's at the office. Actually, he's not, Mrs Mulwray, and he's checked out of his apartment at the El Macondo. That's not his apartment. Anyway, I... The point is, I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business. Whoever set your husband up set me up. L.A.'s a small town. People talk. I don't want to become a local joke. Mr Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit. What? I'll drop the lawsuit. Let's drop the whole thing. Sugar, lemon, or both? Both. Mrs Mulwray, I don't want to drop it. I better talk to your husband about this. Why? What on earth for? Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man. I've been accused of a lot of things before, Mrs Mulwray, but never that. Look, somebody's gone to a lot of trouble here, and I intend to find out. I'm not supposed to be caught with my pants down. Unless it's a problem, I'll talk to your husband. Why should it be a problem? May I speak frankly? You may if you can, Mr Gittes. Well, that little girlfriend was pretty in a cheap sort of a way, of course. She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together. Suppose they did. How does that affect you? It's nothing personal, Mrs Mulwray. It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you? Let's look at it this way. Now, this phoney broad... excuse the language... she tells me she's you. She hires me. Whoever's behind it has nothing against me. They're after your husband. If I can see him, I can help him. Did you talk to him this morning? No... I went riding rather early. Looks like you went quite a distance. I was riding bareback. You... you might try the Oak Pass or the Stone Canyon Reservoir. Frequently Hollis walks around them. Otherwise, he'll be home by 6:30. I'll stop by. Please call first. Sorry, closed to the public, sir. Oh, that's all right, officer. Russ Yelburton, deputy chief of the department. Sorry, Mr Yelburton. Go on down. That's Ok. Gittes. For Christ's sake. Loach. Get out before he sees you. What's going on here? Loach. Hello, Jake. Lou. How are you? Lousy cold I can't seem to shake, but otherwise, I'm Ok. Yeah, summer colds are the worst. Yeah, they are. There's no smoking... That's all right, officer. We'll make an exception. I'll see he's careful and doesn't burn himself. Thanks, Lou. How'd you get past the guard? To tell you the truth, I lied a little. You look like you've done well by yourself. I get by. Sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself. Maybe you have. Yeah, going through other people's dirty linen. Yeah. Tell me, you still putting Chinamen in jail for spitting in the laundry? You're a little behind the times, Jake. They use steam irons now, and I'm out of Chinatown. Since when? Since I made lieutenant. Congratulations. What are you doing around here? I'm looking for somebody. Who? Hollis Mulwray. You seen him? Yeah. I'd like to talk to him. You'd like to talk to him. You're welcome to try. There he is. Looks like he was washed down the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim? Of course. Obviously the fall must have knocked him unconscious. Mrs Mulwray, this alleged affair your husband was having... the publicity... didn't make him morose or unhappy? It didn't make him happy. There is no possibility that he would have taken his own life? No. Mrs Mulwray... Do you happen to know the name of the young lady in question? No. Or where she might be? Certainly not. You and your husband never discussed her? He... We... we did. He wouldn't tell me her name. We quarrelled over her, of course. It came as a complete surprise to me. A complete surprise? I thought you hired a private investigator. A... private investigator? Mr Gittes. Oh... Well, yes, but I did that because I thought I would put an end to a ridiculous rumour that had no basis. Huh. When did Mr Gittes inform you that these rumours had some foundation in fact? Just before the story broke in the papers, Lou. You wouldn't happen to know where I could find her? No. Or her name? No. Of course not. Will you need me for anything else, lieutenant? Oh, no, Mrs Mulwray. If we need any more information, we'll be in touch. Of course you have my deepest sympathy. I'll see her to the car, Lou. I'll be right back. Jake, come on, what's the story? Take it easy, guys. Let us get through. We better do this in a hurry. Guys, give us a little room. You want a picture, guys? Here it is. - What? - Hey. Gittes. Two "Ts" and an "E." Thank you for... going along with me back there. I just didn't want to explain anything. I'll send you a check. A check? To make it official that I've hired you. I'll get to it this afternoon if I can. Jake, what are you doing here? Nothing, Morty. It's my lunch hour. Thought I'd drop by and see who dropped dead lately. Isn't this something? Middle of a drought, and the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A. Yeah. Looks pretty banged up. Well, that's a long fall. So how are you doing, Morty? Never better, except for this darn cough. You know me, Jake. Yeah. Who you got there? Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk. Used to hang around Ferguson's Alley. Quite a character. Lately he'd been living in one of the downtown storm drains. Had a bureau dresser down there and everything. Yeah. He drowned, too. Come again? Yeah. Got drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed. The L.A. River? Yeah. Right under Hollenbeck Bridge. What's wrong with that? Why, it's dry as a bone, Morty. It's not completely dry. Well, he ain't going to exactly drown in a damp riverbed no matter how soused he is. We got water out of him. He drowned. Hello. Howdy. You were riding out here the other day, weren't you? Speak English? ¿Habla Ingles? Yes. You were talking to a man a few days ago. He wore glasses? Yes. What did you talk about, do you mind my asking? The water. What about the water? When it comes. When it comes? What did you tell him? It comes in different parts of the river, every night a different part. Son of a bitch. Goddamn Florsheim shoe. Hold it there, kitty cat. Hold it. Hello, Claude. Where'd you get the midget? You're a very nosy fellow, kitty cat, huh? You know what happens to nosy fellows? Huh? No? Want to guess? Huh? No? Ok. They lose their noses. Next time you lose the whole thing. Cut it off and feed it to my goldfish. Understand? Understand, Gittes? I understand. All right. So some contractor wants to build a dam, and he makes a few payoffs. So what? Think you can nail Mulvihill? He'll claim you were trespassing. Don't want Mulvihill. I want the big boys that are making the payoffs. Then what? Sue the shit out of them. Yeah? Yeah. What is it, Sophie? A Miss Sessions is calling. - Who? - Ida Sessions. Don't know her. Take a number. Sue people like that, they're liable to be having dinner with the judge who's trying the suit. I'm sorry. Miss Sessions insists. She says you know her. Ok. Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure. Oh, yes, we have. Are you alone? Isn't everyone? What can I do for you? Well, I'm a working girl. I didn't come in to see you on my own. When did you come in? I pretended to be Mrs Mulwray. Remember? Shut the fuck up. Beg your pardon? Yes, I remember. Beg your pardon? Is something wrong? No. I was just checking some details with my two associates. Go on. I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr Mulwray. If it ever comes out, I want somebody to know that I didn't know what would happen. I understand. Who was your employer? That could be helpful to both of us. Oh, no. Oh, no. No. What's your address? Maybe we could talk this over. No, Mr Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's L.A. Post-Record. Obituary column? You'll find one of those people. Miss... Sure. How do you like them apples? Madam. Thank you for coming. Yes, sir? Drink? Tom Collins with lime, not lemon, please. Tom Collins with lime. I got your check in the mail. Yes. As I said, I was very grateful. Mrs Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough. How much would you like? Oh, stop it. The money's fine. It's generous, but... I think you short-changed me on the story. - I have? - I think so. Something besides the death of your husband was bothering you. You were upset, but not that upset. Mr Gittes, don't tell me how I feel. Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato... All of it quicker than the wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police. It wasn't much of a lie. If your husband was killed, it was. This could look like you paid me off to withhold evidence. But he wasn't killed. Mrs Mulwray, I think you're hiding something. Well... I suppose I am. Actually, I knew about the affair. How did you find out? My husband. He told you? And you weren't the least bit upset? I was grateful. Mrs Mulwray, you'll have to explain that. Why? Look, I do matrimonial work. It's my metier. When a wife says she's happy that her husband's cheating on her, it runs contrary to my experience. Unless what? She was cheating on him. Were you? I dislike the word "cheat." Did you have affairs? Mr Gittes... Did he know about it? I wouldn't tell him every time I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean. Anything else you want to know about me? Where were you when your husband died? I can't tell you. You mean you don't know? I mean I can't tell you. You were seeing someone, too. For very long? I don't see anyone for very long, Mr Gittes. It's difficult for me. Now, I think you know all you need know about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this then or now. Is that all? Oh, by the way, what does this "C" stand for? Cu... Cross. That's your maiden name? Yes. Why? No reason. You must've had a reason to ask. No. I'm just a snoop. Oh, no. I have my own car. The Packard. Wait a minute, sonny. I think you better come with me. But why? There's nothing more to say. Will you get my car, please? Ok., go home. But in case you're interested, your husband was murdered. Somebody's been dumping thousands of tons of water from the city's reservoirs, and we're supposed to be in the middle of a drought. He found out and was killed. A waterlogged drunk's in the morgue... Involuntary manslaughter if anybody wants to take the trouble, which they don't. Half the city is trying to cover it all up, which is fine by me. But, Mrs Mulwray, I goddamn near lost my nose, and I like it. I like breathing through it. And I still think that you're hiding something. Mr Gittes. J.J. Gittes to see Mr Yelburton. Mr Yelburton will be busy for some time. Well, it's my lunch hour. I can wait. He's liable to be tied up indefinitely. I take a long lunch hour. All day sometimes. Noah Cross worked for the water department. Yes... no. Well, did he or didn't he? He owned it. He owned it. He owned the water department? Yes. You mean, he owned the entire water supply for the city? Yes. How did they get it away from him? Mr Mulwray felt the public should own the water. Mr Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned it. Along with Mr Mulwray. They were partners? Yes. Yes, they were partners. Mr Yelburton will see you now. Mr Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on. Yeah. Must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances. Oh, yes. Hollis was the best department chief the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose? Cut myself shaving. You ought to be more careful. That must really smart. Only when I breathe. Only when you breathe. Don't tell me you're still working for Mrs Mulwray. I never was. I don't understand. Neither do I, actually. You hired me, or you hired that chippy to hire me. Mr Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense. Well, let's look at it this way... Mulwray didn't want to build a dam. He had a reputation that was hard to get around. You decided to ruin it. Then he found out you were dumping water at night. Then he was... drowned. Mr Gittes, that's an outrageous accusation. I don't know what you're talking about. Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet during a drought... That's, news. Mr Gittes... we're... we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate orange groves in the Northwest valley. The farmers there have no legal right to our water. We've been helping some of them out. Naturally, when you divert water, there's a little runoff. Yeah. A little runoff. Where'd you say those groves were? In the Northwest valley. That's like saying they're in Arizona. Mr Gittes, my field men are out. I can't give you the exact location. You're a married man, aren't you? Yes. Hard-working? Wife? Kids? Yes. I don't want to nail you. I want to find out who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think about it. Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can put the whole thing off on a few big shots, and you can stay head of the department for the next 20 years. Drink? No, thank you. What is your usual salary? $35 a day, plus 20 to my associates, plus expenses, plus a bonus if I show results. Whoever is behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all of this trouble? Money. How they planned to make it out of emptying reservoirs, that I don't know. I'll pay your salary plus $5,000 if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved. Sophie, draw up one of our standard contracts for Mrs Mulwray. Yes, Mr Gittes. Tell me something... did you get married before or after. Mulwray and your father sold the water department? Noah Cross is your father, isn't he? Yes, of course. It was sometime after. I was just out of grade school when they did that. Then you married your father's business partner? You've already got one going, Mrs Mulwray. Oh. Does... my talking about your father upset you? Why, no. Yes. A little. You see, Hollis and my f... my father had a falling-out finally. Over you or over the water department? Why should it be over me? Then it was over the water department. Yes. Hollis felt that the water should belong to the public, and I don't think my father felt that way. Actually, it was over the Van der Lip Dam. You know, the dam that broke. Oh, yeah? Yes. Hollis never forgave him for it. Never forgave him for what? For talking him into building it. They never spoke from that time on. You sure about that? Of course I'm sure. Sign here. The copy's for you. Mr Gittes? Gittes. Oh. How do you do? You've got a nasty reputation, Mr Gittes. I like that. Thanks. If you were a bank president, that would be one thing, but in your business, it's admirable, and it's good advertising. It doesn't hurt. It's why you attracted a client like my daughter. Probably. But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's come up with another husband. No. She thinks the last one was murdered. How'd she get that idea? I think I gave it to her. I believe they should be served with the head. Fine. Long as you don't serve chicken that way. Ha ha ha ha. Tell me, what do the police say? They're calling it an accident. Who's the investigating officer? Lou Escobar. He's a lieutenant. Do you know him? Oh, yeah. Where from? We used to work together. In Chinatown. Would you call him a capable man? Very. Honest? As far as it goes. He has to swim in the same water we all do. But you've no reason to think he's bungled the case? None. That's too bad. Too bad? It disturbs me. Makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. What are you charging her? My usual fee, plus a bonus if I get results. Are you, sleeping with her? You don't have to think about that to remember, do you? If you want an answer to that question, Mr Cross, I'll put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon. - Mr Gittes... - Gittes. Gittes. You're dealing with a disturbed woman who just lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down. What for? You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't. Why is that funny? It's what the district attorney used to tell me in Chinatown. Yeah? Was he right? Exactly what do you know about me? Sit down. Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the newspapers. Of course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fee is and pay you $10,000 if you find Hollis' girlfriend. Girlfriend? Disappeared, hasn't she? Yeah. Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her? Maybe. If Mulwray was murdered, she'd be one of the last to have seen him alive. When's the last time you saw Mulwray? Sheriff's gold posse. Bunch of damn fools. They paid $5,000 apiece towards the sheriff's re-election. I let them practise up out here. Yeah. Do you remember the last time you saw Mulwray? At my age, you tend to forget. Five days ago outside the Pig 'n Whistle, and you had one hell of an argument. I got the pictures in my office if that'll help you remember. What was the argument about? My daughter. What about her? Just find the girl, Mr Gittes. I happen to know Hollis was... fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can. I had no idea you and Hollis were that fond of one another. Hollis Mulwray made this city, and he made me a fortune. We were a lot closer than Evelyn realised. If you want to hire me, I still have to know what the argument was about. My daughter's a very jealous woman. I didn't want her to find out about the girl. How did you find out? I still got a few teeth left in my head and a few friends in town. Ok. I'll... I'll have my secretary draw up the papers. Tell me... are you frightened for the girl or what Evelyn might do to her? Just find the girl. I'll look into it as soon as I've checked out some orange groves. Orange groves? We'll be in touch, Mr Cross. I'm a little lost. Could you tell me where the plat books for the Northwest valley are? Part of it's in Ventura County. We don't have Ventura County in our Hall of Records. I'll settle for Los Angeles County. Row 23, Section "C." Weasel. Say... sonny, why do they have all those names pasted in the plat books? Land sales out of escrow are recorded within the week. Then these are all new owners? That's right. Well, that means most of the valley's sold in the last few months. If that's what it says. Can I check one of these volumes out? Sir, this is not a lending library. It's the Hall of Records. Oh. How about a ruler? A ruler? Yeah. The print's real fine. I left my glasses home. I'd like to be able to read across. Why, thank you. Hold it right there. All right. Quit it now. Search the man. See if he's armed. I said see if he's armed, not empty his pockets. Search him. Search him. He ain't armed. Who you with, the water department or the real estate office? Get away from me. Come near me with that again, you'll need a pair of them. Pick on somebody your own size. Cut that out. Give the man a chance to say something. The name's Gittes. I'm a private investigator. I'm not with either one of them. What you doing out here, mister? A client hired me to see if the water department was irrigating your land. Irrigating my land? The water department's sending you people to blow up my water tanks. They put poison down three of my wells. Who'd hire you for a thing like that? Mrs Evelyn Mulwray. Mulwray's the one who's done it to us. Mulwray's dead. You don't know what you're talking about, you dumb Okie. Well, that's that. What's going on? You didn't look too good, so we thought we better call your employer. Thanks for coming. That dam's a con job. What dam? The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. Into building it, but the water's not going to L.A. It's coming right here. To the valley? Everything you see. Everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today. In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill, 12,000, Clarence Speer, 5,000, and Jasper Lamar Crabb, 25,000 acres. Jasper Lamar Crabb? You know him? I think I would've remembered. Yeah. They're blowing these farmers out of their land, then picking it up for peanuts. You have any idea what this land would be worth with a steady water supply? About 30 million more than they paid for it. Hollis knew about this? That's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb. We got it. What? We got it. What is it? "A memorial service was held today "for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He passed away two weeks ago." Well, is that unusual? He passed away two weeks ago, and one week ago he bought the land. That's unusual. Hello. I'm Mr Palmer. Can I help you folks? Yes, I hope so. It's Dad... I can't seem to handle him any more. My goodness. It's nothing with Dad. It's, it's me. Dad is an absolute angel. It's just that he and my hu... Oh, I don't know. I'm anxious for him to have the best. Money is no object. Perhaps if we met with your father... There is one question. Of course. Do you accept people of the Jewish persuasion? I'm sorry, but, we don't. Don't be sorry. Neither does Dad. We wanted to be sure, didn't we, hon? Would it be possible for me to see a list of your patients? We never reveal the names of our guests. You would appreciate that if your father came to live with us. That's exactly what I wanted to hear you say. Good. Is it too late for us to look around? No. Allow me to show you. May we take a stroll on our own? If you'll confine yourself to the main building. It's almost bedtime. We understand. Come, my sweet. Charley, you ought to know better than that. Sit down. Have a chair. They're all there. Every goddamn name. You're looking at the owners of a 50,000-acre empire. They can't be. They may not know it, but they are. - Hello, girls. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Are any of you Emma Dill? Yes? Are you Emma? Yes. I've wanted to meet you for a long time. Why? Did you know you were a wealthy woman? Oh, I'm not. Yes, you are. You own a lot of land. No more. Some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property at Long Beach, but we lost it. That's very beautiful. Thanks. Where did you get this piece of material? At the Albacore Club. - Abbacore? - No. The Albacore. It's a fish. My grandson is a member. They take very nice care of us. How do they do that? Oh, give us things, not just like this old flag, but... But what? We're an unofficial charity of theirs, Mr Gittes. Would you come with me, please? Someone wants to talk with you. - Goodbye, ladies. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. I want you to meet someone, Gittes. Can we leave the lady out of this? Yeah. Why not? I'd like to see her to the car. She knows where it's at. I'll stay. Get in the car. Maid's night off? Why? What do you mean, why? Nobody's here, that's why. I gave everyone the night off. Easy. It's an innocent question. No question from you is innocent, Mr Gittes. I guess you're right. To you, Mrs Mulwray. Frankly, tonight you saved my as... You saved my neck. Tell me, Mr Gittes... does this often happen to you? What's that? I'm judging only on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if this is how you go about your work, I'd say you'd be lucky to get through a day. This hasn't happened to me for a long time. When was the last time? Why? It's an innocent question. In Chinatown. What were you doing there? Working for the district attorney. Doing what? As little as possible. The district attorney gives his men advice like that? They do in Chinatown. Why did you leave the police force? Do you have any... peroxide, or... anything like that? Surely. Will you come this way? My God. It's a nasty cut. I had no idea... Oh. Sorry. There. Is it painful? It must be painful. What's wrong? Your eye. What about it? What? There's something black in the green part of your eye. Oh, that. It's... it's a flaw... in the iris. A flaw? Yes... it's a sort of birthmark. Did you wear a uniform? Sometimes. Must have looked cute in blue. Give me a break, will ya? I don't know you. I want to know more about you. Not now. You really don't like to talk about the past, do you? I'm tired. No. Why does it bother you to talk about it? It bothers everybody that works there. Where? Chinatown. Everybody. To me, it was just bad luck. Why? You can't always tell what's going on. Like with you. Why was... why was it bad luck? I was trying to keep someone from being hurt. I ended up making sure that she was hurt. Look for the woman. Was there a woman involved? Of course. Dead? Yes, hello? Oh. Oh, my God. Let me know. Look, don't do anything. Don't do anything until I get there. I... I have to go. Where? Just that I have to. I want to know where you're going. No, please. Don't be angry. It has nothing to do with you or any of this. Where are you going? Please. Trust me this much. I'll be back. There is... there is something that I should tell you about. The, the fishing club that old lady mentioned... the pieces of the flag... The Albacore Club. It has to do with my father. I know. He owns it. You know? I saw him. You saw him? My father? When? This morning. You didn't tell me. Well, there hasn't been much time. What... what... what did he say? What did he say? That you were jealous. And that he was afraid what you might do. Do? To whom? Mulwray's girlfriend for one. He wanted to know where she was. I want you to listen to me. Now, my father... is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy. Are you trying to tell me that he might be behind all this? It's possible. Even the death of your husband? It's possible. Now, please... don't ask any more questions. Just wait for me here. I need you here. No, no, no. Give me the keys. You... It's either that or you drive yourself to the police. The police? Come on, Mrs Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there. She's not tied up. You know what I mean. You're holding her against her will. I am not. Ok. Then let's go talk to her. No. She's... she's too upset. What about? Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her. I didn't want her to know until I could make plans for us to leave. You mean she just found out about it? That's not what it looks like, Mrs Mulwray. What does it look like? Like she knows more than you want her to tell. You're insane. Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I don't want to hurt you. You won't go to the police if I tell you? I will if you don't. She... she... she... she's my sister. Take it easy. If she's your sister, she's your sister. Why all the secrecy? I can't... Is it because of Hollis, because she was seeing your husband, is that it? I would never have harmed Hollis. He was the most... gentle, decent man imaginable. And he... he put up with more from me than you'll ever know. I... wanted him to be happy. I borrowed your husband's car. I'll bring it back in the morning. Aren't you going... coming back with me? Don't worry. I'm not going to tell anybody about this. That's not what I meant. Yeah. Well... I'm tired, Mrs Mulwray. Good night. Gittes? Gittes? Yeah? Ida Sessions wants to see you. Who? Ida Sessions. You remember Ida. Yeah, I do. Sure, you do. I tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me, she can call me at my office. 8481/2 East Kensington. Echo Park. She begged me to call. She's waiting for you. Find anything interesting, Gittes? What are you doing around here? Didn't you call me? How come you happen to know her? I don't. Come here. I want to show you something. Isn't that your phone number? Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often. Well, just to make sure, we had Loach give you a call. What happened to your nose, Gittes, somebody slam the bedroom window on it? Nope. Your wife got excited. She crossed her legs too quick. You understand what I mean, pal? Loach. They look familiar? Yeah. I took them. So what? How did she happen to have them? You tell me or I guess. You must really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes? I don't think about it much. Give me a few days. I'll get back to you. I'd like to go home. I want the other pictures, Gittes. What pictures? This broad hired you, not Evelyn Mulwray. Yeah? Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake Mulwray down. She hired you. That's how come you found out he was murdered. I heard it was an accident. Come on, Gittes. Who the hell do you think you're dealing with? Mulwray had salt water in his lungs. You followed him day and night. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray, and she's been paying you off ever since. You accusing me of extortion? Absolutely. I don't need a few days. You're dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I wouldn't extort a nickel from my worst enemy. I want the rest of the pictures. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion, minimum. What do you think, Evelyn Mulwray killed her husband in the ocean, then dragged him to the reservoir to make it look more like an accident? Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean. Why is that? He found out they were dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up. What the hell are you talking about? Come on. I'll show you. Come on, Lou. You're in charge. Make a decision. Ha. It's too late. Too late for what? They only dump the water at night. Reach anybody? Yelburton. He's the new chief. I know who he is. Go on. He says... I know what he says. Shut up. Go on. There's irrigation in the valley, and there's always a little runoff after they do that. He says Gittes knows this, and he's been going around making irresponsible accusations all last week. Let's swear out a warrant for her arrest. What are we waiting for? He just made lieutenant. Wants to hang on to his little gold bar. Have your client in my office in two hours. And remember, I don't have to let you go. I've got you right now for withholding evidence. Loach. Where's Mrs Mulwray? These her bags? Is she going on a trip? What are you doing? What's going on here? Is she going on a vacation? Mrs Mulwray no home. Mrs Mulwray no home, huh? Well, I'll just have a look around, huh? Yeah, Yeah. Bad for the glass. Oh, yeah. Bad for glass. Salt water very bad for glass. Salt water? Very, very bad. See? What's that? Huh? Right there. There. Huh. You wait. You wait. Chow hoi tai Dai. How are you? I've been calling you. It's all right. Have you... have you slept? Sure. Have you had lunch? Khan can fix you something. Where's the girl? Upstairs. Why? I want to see her. She's having a bath right now. Why do you want to see her? Going some place? Yes. We have a 5:30 train to catch. Jake. J.J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar. What's the matter? What's wrong? I told you, we have a 5:30... You're going to miss your train. Lou? Meet me at 1972 Canyon Drive. Yeah. As soon as you can. Why did you do that? You know any good criminal lawyers? No. Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive, but you can afford it. Will you please tell me what this is all about? I found these in your backyard in the pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they? Didn't they? I don't know. Yes, probably. Yes, positively. It's where he was drowned. What? There's no time to be shocked by the truth. The coroner's report proves he had salt water in his lungs when he was killed. I want to know why it happened before Escobar gets here because I don't want to lose my licence. I don't know what you are talking about. This is the craziest, most insane thing... Stop it. I'll make it easy. You were jealous. You had a fight. He fell. He hit his head. His girl is a witness. You had to shut her up. You got the money to keep her quiet. Yes or no? No. Who is she? Don't tell me she's your sister. You don't have a sister. I'll tell you. I'll tell you the truth. Good. What's her name? Katherine. Katherine who? She's my daughter. I said I want the truth. She's my sister. She's my daughter. My sister, my daughter. I said I want the truth. All right. She's my sister and my daughter. Khan, please, go back. For God's sake, keep her upstairs. Go back. My father and I... Understand? Or is it too tough for you? He raped you? Then what happened? I ran away. To Mexico. Hollis came and... and took care of me. I couldn't see her. I was 15. I wanted to, but I... I couldn't. Then... Now I want to be with her. I want to take care of her. Where are you going to take her now? Back to Mexico. No. You can't take the train. Escobar will be looking for you everywhere. How... How about a plane? No. That's worse. You better just get out of here. Leave all this stuff here. Where does Khan live? Get the exact address. All right. Those didn't belong... to Hollis. How do you know? He didn't wear bifocals. Katherine, say hello to Mr Gittes. Hello. Hello. He lives at 1712 Alameda. Do you know where that is? Sure. J.J. Gittes and Associates. Sophie, get me Walsh. Yes, Mr Gittes. - Jake? - Yeah. Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes. What the hell's the matter... Relax and I'll tell you. Wait in the office for me. About two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda. Jesus. That's in Chinatown, ain't it? I know where it is. Just do it. 1712 Alameda. Come on in, Lou. Looks like we're both too late. She flew the coop. I don't suppose you have any idea where she went. As a matter of fact, I do. Where? Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up. What's the maid's address? She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down. No, no, no, Gittes. You're going to show us. What for? Because if she ain't there, you're going downtown, and you'll stay there until she does show up. Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can. Tell us about it on the way to San Pedro. Let's get the little lady. Lou, can I ask you a favour? I'd like to bring her out myself. She's not armed or nothing. She won't be a problem. I just want a minute alone with her. It would mean a lot to her... and to me. You never learn, do you, Jake? I guess not. Ok. But... I'll give you three minutes. Just three minutes. Gee, thanks, Lou. Yeah? Hello. Mr Gittes. Come in. This is some surprise, Mr Gittes. Call me Jake. How you doing, Curly? Just having supper. Care to join us? No, thanks. How about some wine? Hey, honey, this is... I know. No, thank you, Curly, but I would like a glass of water. Come out in the kitchen with me a second. Sure thing. Curly, where's your car? In the garage. Where's that? Off the alley. Can you take me somewhere? Sure. After we eat. Right now, Curly. It can't wait. I'll tell my wife. Tell her later, Curl, huh? Drive slow for a block or two, will you, Curly? What's this all about? I'll tell you in a block or two. How much do you owe me? Ah, gee, Mr Gittes, we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it, but my cousin Augie's sick. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada? You'd have to leave tonight. I don't know. I might be able to squeeze 75 bucks out of it for you. Maybe even 100. Plus what I owe? I'll throw that in, too. 1712 Alameda. It's in Chinatown. Wait for me until 8:30. If I don't show up, take them to your boat. You sure this is Ok? Curly, do you know how long I've been in this business? Have you got your chequebook handy, Mr Cross? I've got the girl. You've got her? Where? Do you remember the figures we discussed? Of course I do. Where are you? At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here? An hour. Oh, there you are. Well, you don't look too much worse for wear, Mr Gittes, I must say. Where's the girl? I've got her. Is she all right? She's fine. Well, where is she? With her mother. Got something I'd like to show you, Mr Cross. What is it? An obituary column. Can you see all right in this light? I guess I can manage. What does it mean? That you killed Hollis Mulwray... right here. In that pond. You drowned him. And you left these. The coroner's report shows Mulwray had salt water in his lungs. Hollis was... always fascinated by tide pools. You know what he used to say? I haven't the faintest idea. That's where life begins... sloughs, tide pools. When we first come out here, he figured if you dumped water into the desert sand and let it percolate down to the bedrock, it would stay there instead of evaporate like it does in most reservoirs. You'd only lose 20% instead of 70 or 80. That's what you were going to do in the valley. It's what I am doing. When the bond issue passes Tuesday, there'll be $8 million to build an aqueduct to the reservoir. There'll be irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they won't get. That's all taken care of. See, Mr Gittes, either you bring the water to L.A., or you bring L.A. To the water. How will you do that? By incorporating the valley into the city. Simple as that. How much are you worth? I have no idea. How much do you want? I just want to know what you're worth. Over 10 million? My, yes. Why are you doing it? What can you buy that you can't already afford? The future, Mr Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl? I want the only daughter I've got left. As you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago. Who do you blame for that, her? I don't blame myself. See, Mr Gittes, most people never have to face the fact... at the right time and the right place, they're capable of anything. Claude, take those glasses from him, will you? It's not worth it, Mr Gittes. It's really not worth it. Now take us to the girl. You remember "Night Train" Claude Mulvihill, don't you, boys? Mr Cross, these are my associates, Mr Walsh and Mr You're under arrest, Jake. Good news. Withholding evidence, extortion, accessory after the fact. I didn't extort nothing from nobody. This is Noah Cross, if you don't know... Evelyn's father. He's the bird you're after. I can explain everything... Lieutenant. Give me five minutes. He's rich, do you understand? Shut up. Thinks he'll get away with anything. I'll lock you into the wheel of that car. Lieutenant, I am rich. I am Noah Cross. Evelyn Mulwray is my... He's crazy, Lou. He killed Mulwray because of the water thing. Water? Listen to me for five minutes. Lock him to the wheel of that car. Lou, you don't know what's going on. Katherine. Katherine. I am your grandfather. Come, miss. My dear, I'm your grandfather. Katherine, get in the car. Go on, go on. But... No, no. Just go on. I'll follow. Get away from her. - Get away. - Evelyn. Please, please be reasonable. Come to my... Get away from her. Evelyn. How many years have I got? She's mine, too. She's never going to know that. Evelyn, you're a disturbed woman. You cannot hope to provide... Evelyn, put that gun away. Let the police handle this. He owns the police. Get away from her. You'll have to kill me first. Get away. Get... Katherine, close the door. Halt. Oh. Oh, no. Call the captain. Get an ambulance. No. Turn him loose. Turn them all loose. Oh, no. Lord. Oh, Lord. Oh, no, no. No. No. Don't look. Don't look. Oh, no. No. No. No. Oh... Oh, no... As little as possible. What's that? What's that? You want to do your partner a big favour? Take him home. Take him home. Just get him the hell out of here. Come on, Jake. Go home, Jake. I'm doing you a favour. Come on, Jake. Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown. All right. Come on. Clear the area. On the sidewalk. On the sidewalk. Get off the street. Get off the street.
