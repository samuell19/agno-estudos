A wise person once told me that life is a journey. Every decision you make has a consequence that affects everyone and everything around you. 'Cause along that journey, you never know where you may end up, don't know what paths you have to take, you never know who you'll meet, who you can trust, or who really got your back. But the scariest part about it all, you never know how it's gonna end. Joe, I was about to make your lunch. I just got off the phone with. I was, I swear, I swear I was. Man, get your ass away.

But here's the important thing, man. If he would have listened to me he wouldn't have been in that motherfucker in the first place. And that's why I need you to listen to me right now. I don't know what you got going on in your head. I don't know what you got planned, but you got 200,000 reasons not to be tripping out here in these motherfucking streets, bro. Nah, street. These streets ain't fucked up, man. It's how you navigate these streets. These niggas fucked up, street. But that's what I'm trying to tell you. You ain't got to navigate no streets, man.

Say, my man, you know somebody named street? No, bro, I don't know a guy named street. Yo, you said street? Yeah. I know him. For real? Yeah. And I know somebody who can get in touch with him. Let me call my friend vinny real quick. Okay. Appreciate it. Yo. I hear you looking for street. Yeah. For what? Apparently he my grandfather. Your grandfather? What's your name, man? Zaire? Yeah.

Last time I saw you, you was yea high, man, now look at you, all grown up. Big and strong. Glad one of us remember each other 'cause I damn sure don't remember you. So you obviously have some animosity but we've got to get something straight, man, we gonna start this off the right way. And we gonna start off with respect. And the first thing you need to know about respect is that if you don't give it, you're not gonna get it. So let that be your last motherfucking time you ever curse me. I got respect, believe that. Look how you living. See where I stay, where my momma stay, bumfuck nowhere in Mississippi in a shack, eating sardines and shit, not knowing when you're gonna have your next meal. And we're talking about respect. Where the hell you been the last 20 years? Man, let me tell you something about life, man. Life ain't easy. And it ain't just black and it ain't just white. There's a lot of gray in the middle. And that's probably the things you don't understand when it comes to your mother, your father or even when it come to me. But look, the one thing we can't change is the past. But what we can do is work on the future. And the future is this. You 'bout to be living here now. So here's a key to the crib. That's the key to the car. And what about my mom? I can't leave her out there, what about her? Man, let's get this straight, man. Your moms broke ties with me. But that's for another day. Right now, uncle P already on top of it. We gonna do everything we can to get out this situation. And in the meantime, I've got a job for you at the pharmacy until I can get you enrolled in TSU.

And you gonna be all right too. It's always just been us. Me, you against the world and it's gonna always be that way. I'm going to do everything and anything to get you out of there, I promise. I still remember everything you taught me. You don't mess with them people, so I don't mess with them people, no matter how welcoming they act. I know you sent me here to be with someone I'm supposed to trust. But how can I trust or love someone who's never tried to reach out to me and they supposed to be my family? Nothing in this world could keep me away from my sun. I'm sorry you in there, ma, but I got you, I promise. Love you, ma, Zaire. Hello. Who is this? This is your pop, street. Wait, what? Ain't you locked up? How the hell you get my number? Oh, first of all, man, I got your number from your grandfather. Pen or no pen, I got access to whatever I want in here, man. Well, if that's the case, you would have came around a whole lot sooner than I was. Look, son, I know it's a lot of things you don't understand about me and your momma, man. But if you give me a little chance to explain. Look, man, I ain't got time right now, all right? I got to get back to doing what I've been doing since you walked out.

Hello. This your pop, street. I know who this is, what you want? We need to finish that conversation we started, man. What conversation is that, man? 'Cause now is not a good time.

But your grandfather said she did a good job taking care of you, man. So you know, that's what it is. He said that? Yeah, he said that. You got a lot of potential, man. And at the end of the day, it ain't about me and your mom, man. It's about you and you making the right choices. Look, son, we both know you got a lot of resentment toward us man but the resentment you got can't compare to the love we have. Whether you like it or not, you're a part of this family, you're a Dixon. Ain't nothing you could do gonna change that. The greatest gift a father can give his son is knowledge that he didn't have. And my father tried to give it to me and look what it got me. You know what I mean? I should have listened, man. Just listen to me, Zaire. Word. I got it. So how you holding up up in there? Sonny.

But I just want to thank you, you know, not only taking me in but also taking care of my moms. I really do appreciate you for that. Yeah, it take a big man to do that. Yeah, but you ain't got to thank me for that. That's what family do. And even though me and your mom got our differences, she's still family because of you. I've always loved her because of you. You know what I'm saying? And she did a hell of a job raising you, man, look at you. Yeah. Yeah, man, you know what they say about family? You might always love 'em but that don't mean you always like 'em. Well, she did a hell of a job with you, man. But I really like you. I like your style. I like how you move, man, you know what I'm saying? You street with it. But you smart with it. And that's that good balance. It's funny that you said that. My pop say he used to say the same thing.

When you go to war, know your enemy. One thing I know about quick, quick underestimates everybody. He underestimated me when I was two steps ahead of him the whole time. He underestimated junior when he forgot to pay him. But his biggest mistake, he underestimated red and how much she really love little poochie.
