NARRATOR: And now, live from Dallas, Texas, "The Oldest Living Graduate." MAN: (SINGING) Rambling roses round her door. Eliza Jane. Oh, Eliza, Eliza Jane. Oh, Eliza, Eliza Jane. [music playing] NARRATOR: In the news today, this 11th day of July, 1962, well, we have a report now that one of Jim Wilson's cattle trucks of Abilene has been involved in a major accident on I-30. No report at this time of injuries. Weather-wise, Friday and Saturday, look for thunderstorms, with the highest boat days near 98. Hey, you're listening to the Hello, Texas show. It's sure good to be with you today, so right now, why don't you just sit back and have that extra cup of coffee to your heart, and give ol'-- MAN: Floyd! [music playing] Floyd! [applause] Dammit, Floyd, where the hell are ya? WOMAN: I'll be right back, Martha Ann. What's the matter, Colonel? Where the hell's Floyd? He promised to take me for a drive today. Oh, Floyd's gone into town for a while. What the hell for? Oh, he and Clarence Sickenger had to go to the bank. Clarence Sickenger? Where there's a boy born dumb, he's it. What the hell's Floyd hanging onto him for? Oh, they're going into some kind of business deal together. Yeah, now I'll never get to go for a drive. Who was that you were gabbing with out there in the living room? Sounded like a my god hen house out there. Martha Ann. She's staying here till Floyd and Clarence get back. Who? Martha Ann Sickenger, dammit. Clarence's wife. I never heard of her. Well, of course you have. Her folks own the feed store downtown. Eh, must be a Montgomery, then. That's right. Probably old John Montgomery's daughter. Granddaughter. Yeah, well, what the hell? I used to know old John Montgomery. Nice, quiet sort of fella. Well, his granddaughter damn sure isn't. She's been boring me to death all afternoon. Never heard so much gossip in all my life. MARTHA ANN: Maureen? Oh, god. Maureen? Why don't you go on, and watch your TV set, Colonel? I'll call you when Floyd gets back. Well, he'd better not be all day about it. I want to go for a drive, and that's all there is to it. What's going on in here? Oh, nothing, Martha Ann. Didn't I hear the Colonel talking about something? It's possible. How's he doing these days? Well, you've got ears, haven't you? He gripes and grumbles around here all day long. I thought you and Floyd was going to get a day nurse to look after him? Oh, we tried. Colonel runs through them nurses like peanuts. Sent all the way to Fort Worth for the last one. He had run out of here in less than an hour. You know, Maureen, Clarence says the only place that can handle shell shock business like the Colonel has is the Veteran's Hospital. Well, it don't cause me that much trouble. Ida Ruth does all the cooking and the housework, and Mike Tremaine's always handy if anything really serious comes up. Well, I wouldn't put up with it. Settle down with a crabby old man like that? Yeah, well, he gets on my nerves sometimes, but he does break up the monotony. That is, if anything can break up the monotony in his damn little town. My word, Maureen. The things you say. I just love living here in Bradleyville. Just all sorts of fun things happen here. Just the other day I was at my study club meeting, in walks old Mavis Purnell in a full length mink coat from Neiman & Marcus. Well, I said to her-- Oh, for God's sake, Martha Ann, please-- do me a favor, don't get started on all that damn gossip again. Well, after all, Maureen, you said you wanted to know. I did what? You said you wanted to know what goes on here in Bradleyville. My god. Anyway, here's Mavis Purnell with that old horse face, and them bony legs sticking out thousands of dollars of fur coat. Oh, me-- it does nothing for her. Absolutely nothing at all. How'd she get old Dave Purnell to come up with the cash for new coat? She caught him running around with a little ol' bouncy barmaid from Big Spring. Ah. God. You wouldn't think he could get it up with a block and tackle. Ha! Much less have enough to play games with a barmaid. Block and tackle? [laughter] I'm gonna have to tell that one to the girls at the study club. Yeah, please do that. While you're at it, you can tell them something for me. Cackling roosters and crowing hens come to no good end. Just go on back, and watch your TV set, Colonel. Aren't they showing them reruns of them cattle drive shows? I'm sick of that damn show. Supposed to be driving 3,000 head, or such like. Crooked horse, same spot of steers going by the screen 42 times. I think they got about 25 head out there, that bumble dickin' trail boss. Keeps griping about being short handed. Hello there, Colonel Kincaid. Who are you? Martha Ann Sickenger. Oh, yes. You're Martha Montgomery. Yeah, pretty little thing, ain't ya? Well, I hope so, Colonel. How come you married that dumb butted Clarence Sickenger? Well, I-- Sometimes a person ain't so smart-- how come your folks let you get hung up with Clarence Sickenger? Well, I-- I thought old John Montgomery would have more sense than to let a daughter of his marry a Sickenger. Didn't let yourself get in a family way before the wedding, did ya? Of course not, Colonel. Must have been the money, then. Got any kids, there, Martha Ann? Yes, sir. Two. Well, good for you. At least Clarence is good for something. Old Floyd Maureen here ain't got nary a nothing. Dammit, now, Colonel, don't get started on that again. Hoping I'd have me some grandkids one of these days, but anybody with eyes in his head can see it's too damn late now. Oh, the hell with it. Come on, Martha Ann, let's go in the living room. Too damn late now. Go on, Martha Ann. Keep it up, Colonel. Every time you open your mouth, you're just talking yourself one step closer to the old soldiers' home. Oh, I never should have married that woman. Barren as a by God 30 year old yule. [phone ringing] Bumble-dickin' phone. I'm coming! Kincaid here. Who the hell's this? Who? Never heard of ya. Hell yes, this is the Kincaid residence. Where else would I be? Colonel, I've got it out here on extension. It's not for you. Damn sure is too for me. I answered it, didn't I? Well, if you didn't want to talk to me, then why the hell did you call up my house? This better not be one of them dirty phone calls. Dammit, Colonel, hang up. The call isn't for you. You mean it's for you? You're a pretty sad ass sex fiend, Phil, if you called over here for Maureen. Wasted a by God dime. Will you please get off the phone? This happens to be the Reverend Stone calling. He's got a message of some kind of Floyd. The hell you say? Kincaid here again. But god, Stone, I'm plum ashamed of you. What kind of preacher makes dirty phone calls? You lost a cone, or something? Give me that. Get away from here. I seen a picture of [inaudible] over there to France. It was holier than hell till we got in the trenches. Wound up cussing them whiz bags worse than any of us. Knew more cuss words than old Harry S. Truman. Never heard dammit to hell said with such by god ringin' fervor in my life. All right, hon, that's just enough. Hello. Hello? He hung up. Hell yes he hung up. I let him know the truth of things. Don't much like preachers, anyway. Good god. What are you doing? I'm calling Reverend Stone back and apologize. - Oh, no you ain't. - Just why the hell not? Cause I'm mad at preachers. I don't like them anymore. I know I'm gonna feel like a damn fool for asking this, but why? Why what? Why don't you like preachers? What preachers? Any preachers. Who said that? You did, dammit. You said you didn't like preachers. I get it. Yes, sirree, I get it now. Trying to get me in trouble with the Lord. What? Not only-- not only trying to kick me out of my own house, trying to kick me plumb out of the by God Kingdom of Heaven. What in the hell are you talking about? What am I-- Maureen, do those green grapes in there come from-- Well, I've got news for you, sister-- ain't no way you're going to keep me out of Heaven, cause I done served my term in Hell. But you didn't know that, did you? No, Colonel, I didn't. Well, I did. Served my term in Hell out over there in the trenches, and with the by god top-- the top of them Germans all the time, shooting them machine guns, blappity, blappity, blap. All right, now, Colonel, clam down. Get your hands off me! Go home and take care of all them damn kids you got. Whole of Brandyville full of Sickengers one of these days. Whole county, overrun with goofy looking Sickenger kids. I'm going to call Mike Tremaine. He can take you for a drive, or something. Mike! Yoo-hoo! Mike! Oh, Mike. Can you come in here for a minute, Mike? MIKE: Be right there. There, now, Colonel. Mike can take you anywhere you want to go. Good. [inaudible] What can I do for you, Miss Kincaid? Oh, Mike, I'm sorry to interrupt your chores. I wonder if you could take the Colonel for a little drive? Be glad to. Hi, Miss Sickenger. Hello, Mike. Howdy, Colonel. Howdy there, Mike. What you been up to? Oh, just fixing on some fence out there at the barn. Ah, good for you. Where you want to drive to, Colonel? Wanted to go over to my place out on the lake. I want to look at my town. OK, Colonel. Over to the lake it is. I want to look at my town. My god, Maureen, he's just terrible. Did you hear some of the things he said to me? You? What about the Reverend Stone? My god, that poor old man may never use the telephone again. Who was he talking about when he said he wanted to see his town? There ain't any town out to the lake. Oh, he thinks there is. Where? Pity's sakes. Oh, you know that spread of land we got out there that the Colonel calls a Jenae farm? Sure. Clarence's place is right next to it. Well, that's where the town's supposed to be. We got all that lake property out there, full of nothing but brush and jackrabbits. The Colonel won't even let Floyd run any cattle on it. Well, then how come he's going to give it to Floyd and Clarence? What, the Jenae farm? Sure. That's what I was fixing to tell you earlier. That's the land they're going to develop, right out there along the lakefront. Floyd never mentioned a damn thing to me about their deal having anything to do with that lake property. Are you sure about this? Uh-huh. Clarence says they're going to build houses, and boat docks, and all sorts of things out there. Clarence wants to call it Mumford County Estates Clarence? My god. Houses and boat docks on the Colonel's Jenae farm? I can't believe it. My god. That old man? Why, he treats that property like it was sacred. He goes out there all the time. Look at his town? That's right. Boy, that is really spooky. Looking at a town that ain't there? FLOYD: Maureen? Martha Ann? Where the hell are y'all? Out here in the den, Floyd! MAN: Not too early for a drink, is it? Howdy, everybody. Hi, Floyd. Hey, you cute thing. Where's Daddy? Mike Tremaine took him for a drive. You want a drink? Martha Ann? Uh-huh. Maureen. Clarence. What are you all doing sitting around out here for? How about that, Clarence? I bring an interior decorator all the way from Houston to redo that damn living room, she won't even sit in it. I like this room. It's comfortable. Yeah, after all that dough laid out for that room, nobody ever goes in there. What do you think of that? It's a pretty good looking room. Sure is. Them green drapes in there are about the nicest I ever seen. Yeah, them fireplace rocks in the living room come from San Antone. They sure do. Yeah, I've been meaning to get a load of them rocks for a barbecue pit I'm going to put out on our patio. Oh, you and that darn barbecue pit. He's been fooling around with that thing for two years, now. Who put in your pit, Floyd? Mike Tremaine, and a couple of colored boys. Yeah, forget them rocks. How about lending me old Mike for about a week? Sure. I figure I'll pit that pit right by the swimming pool. Yeah, that's where we got ours. Yeah. That's a good place for one. I just love barbecue. You gonna have barbecue served at the farm estate dinner again, Floyd? Yeah. I got an outfit in Big Spring to bring it all over. Hey! That, uh, Big Spring outfit the same bunch of-- the VFW picnic? Yeah. JB Kelly put me onto 'em. Yeah, the put on a pretty good spread. Yeah. I just wish they wouldn't put the coleslaw in them little paper cups. It just ruins the tastes. Makes it all waxy-like. Don't you think so, Maureen? Oh, well, uh-- Hey, you know what? I don't like them flimsy little ol' plastic forks. Hell, I bet I broke four of 'em just trying to cut a by god piece of meat. Come to think of it, the meat was a little stringy. Eh-- you ever notice how them paper plates get a little soggy-like on the bottom? They sure do. One I had spilled barbecue sauce all over my new dress. Yeah. I found a rock in the beans, too. Tell you what, Clarence-- next year, why don't you and Martha Ann furnish the waxy, rocky, soggy, by-god barbecue? Well-- oh, what the hell, Maureen? I-- I never meant nothing. - No. The sauces is real tasting. Sure, sure. The coffee's pretty good, too. - Score one for Maxwell House. - Yeah. Well, sure. Well, listen, Floyd, I expect Martha Ann and me better be getting on back home. - Aw-- - Oh, yeah. I promised the kids I'd take them riding out to the country club. They'll be madder than hell if I don't. I'll call you tomorrow about our deal, OK? Yeah, that'll be fine. I'll see you to the door. Oh, we know the way. Come on, Martha Ann. That sauce is real good, Maureen. Martha Ann. That sauce is real good, Maureen. My got, I had that whiny little twang in my ear all day long. Oh, hell, she never meant nothing by all that. Yeah, well, she didn't. Why are we such big vetters with the Sickengers nowadays? Never did neither one of us likes 'em very much. Well, I just thought since we was going into this deal together, the families oughta be closer, that's all. Yeah. Closer to the Sickengers, and further away from the Colonel. What's all this crap I hear about the Colonel giving his Jenae farm to you and Clarence? Who told you about that? Never mind about that. Martha Ann did. Big mouth little bitch. Why don't you tell me about that? Because I didn't want you talking to Daddy before I did. You mean you hadn't even asked him yet? No, I hadn't. Oh, hell, that lake thing's way off in the future. I've got a lot of things to do before I get around to him. You'd better not let him know the Sickengers are in on it. He rates them somewheres below Herbert Hoover and the Kaiser. Oh. Thought that spot was reserved for me? Sickengers barbecues. [sigh] The Jenae farm. God, I wish I could get out of town for a while. Oh, no. Nothing doing. Not another trip. Why not? Well, hell, didn't we go all over Europe last year? Took that dumb-ass cruise to the Caribbean the year before that? Caribbean. Caribbean. Never was so sick in my life. That's cause you got drunk every night. Damn right. I stayed drunk in Europe, too. Damn filthy cities. All them foreigners running around, screaming at the top of their lungs. Yeah, well, I'm sorry I made you go. I know you hated it. Snotty limey cab drivers. No more of that by god Europe for me, I can tell you that. How about going to Acapulco for a couple of weeks? Oh, the hell with it. If I want to see a bunch of Mexicans, I'll go over to the Catholic Church. We're not just going to stay here all summer, are we? Well, what's wrong with that? Well, you never used to want to run off every summer. We've lived in this town all our life. Been married for about 200 years. All of a sudden you get the itch to run off all over the by god world. Well, why the hell not? My god, I'd give anything to be able to look out a window and see something besides windmills, mesquite, tumbleweed, and the beautiful skyline of Bradleyville. Naw, we can't go nowhere this summer. Why? Why? Cause you and I got work to do. Important work. I don't want to have a damn thing to do with your deal. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about this. What's that? This here a letter from the Mirabeau B. Lamar Military Academy down in Galveston. So, what? You fixing to join up, or something? Oh, dammit, will you quit wise assin', and pay some attention? All right. Now, it seems that the school is moving from its original campus to a brand new location across town. Good for them. Now, listen. Daddy, it turns out, is the oldest living graduate of this fine institution. All them little cadets are going to have a big celebration, with him as the guest of honor. I still don't see what that has to do with you and me. Well, after I got the letter, I got on the phone and explained as how Dad was in a wheelchair and couldn't travel. So the commandant has agreed to bring the whole ceremony right here to Bradleyville. Why didn't you tell me about this before? Yeah, I surprised you, didn't I? Yeah. I'm surprised, all right. I'm not too damn overwhelmed. I mean-- what's the big deal about a school full of little kids dressed in soldier's suits coming to town? Well, the whole school ain't coming. Just the band, and the honor guard. Besides, the kids ain't important. It's the graduates and their wives. Graduates? Two generals, three full colonels-- 1, 2, 3-- four congressmen, six state senators, an ex-lieutenant governor, and a whole raft of businessmen, and such like. Interesting. Damn right, it's interesting. Hell's fire, all the people that anybody tall good ol' MB Lamar. Dad graduated from there in 1905 before he went on to the A&M. As it turns out, he is the only living member of the school's first graduating class. Hm. Seems that most of his classmates were killed off in the First World War. Oh, that's kinda sad, isn't it? What? This is going to mean a hell of a lot of publicity for Bradleyville. TV, newspaper people coming here. The commandant told me that even the Life magazine people are interested. - Really? You're damn right. We're going to have people coming here from all over the state. We're going to have a ceremony, a banquet, cocktail parties, the works. Hell's fire, this is the biggest thing to hit this town in years. Yeah, well, it'll give me something to do. How much time we got? Well, the actual ceremony isn't until September, but the commandant of the school's coming down here in a couple of days to help make the arrangements. You gonna get that waxy, rocky, big spring outfit to cater the banquet? - Hell, no. These are important people. We can't serve 'em no crappy barbecue. We're gonna have to use the country club. Oh, for God's sakes. Or the Tumbleweed Room at that Bradleyville Inn. They'll take one look at those plastic tulips, and that damn cattle stampede, and nearly run out of there like scared rabbits. No, better go ahead and book the country club. All right. Now, what about the invitations? Well, aside from the folks coming in, I figured to restrict it to the country club membership. Damn right. We don't want no riffraff showing up. Yeah. Now listen, I've been thinking about having a small party out here. I mean, just the commandant's group, and some of our close friends. Close friends, huh? Well, that'll make it small, all right. Yeah, well-- now, you're going to have to come up with something to entertain the wives one afternoon, because I'm thinking about having a stag fish fry out to the lake. OK. Oh-- by the way, when are you gonna tell the Colonel about this? I figured I'd tell him the day before the commandant gets here. That way he'll be ready for everything. Well, what if he says no? Well, he isn't going to say no. Well, you know how he is. Suppose he gets it into his head he don't want to be honored by dear old MB Lamar. Well, he will when he hears about the memorial service. The memorial service? For all the fallen heroes of the Academy. Seeing as how most of his classmates were killed off in the war, I figured that couldn't miss. Memorial services? Stag parties? Graduates? Quite a parade. You know, it occurs to me that this, um-- ceremony for the Colonel is really coming up at a good time, isn't it? What do you mean? What I mean is isn't it lucky that you were able to talk the commandant of that military school into coming down here with all those big shots at the very time when you and Clarence are going into the land development business? You're damn right. Boy, you don't miss a trick, do ya? I do the best I can. Well, I'd better get on over to the country club, and get things started. Oh, oh-- listen, I just remembered. Uh-- the Reverend Stone wouldn't have anything to do with the memorial service, would he? Yeah, I'm gonna get him to conduct it. He's supposed to call me about it some time today. What the hell is so funny? What? [applause] [groovy music] [static] [soft country music] SINGER: Don't break my heart. Don't leave me here to cry. I never could live-- Ain't no cars in the garage. I reckon Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid drove off someplace. Fine with me. Have a little peace and quiet around here for a while. Sit down, Mike. Sit down, and take it easy. Well, Colonel, I oughta get back on that fence. To hell with it. Floyd can wait on that damn fence. Sit down, now, dammit. That's an order. Yes, sir. You do much fishing, Mike? Yes, sir, every chance that I get. Yeah? Who do you go fishing with? George Williams, mostly. I used to go fishing with your daddy. Bet you didn't know that, did you? Yes, sir. Daddy used to brag about catfish y'all would catch. Carter Tremaine and me used to go fishing all the time. Then my damn legs went out on me. Yes, sir. I know. How is old Carter? My god, I ain't seen him in a long spell. Well, he-- he's dead, Colonel. He passed away two years ago last winter. God, that's right. I forgot. You know, your dad and me was good friends. I'm sorry I forgot about him passing away. It's all right, colonel. Yeah, we used to have a lot of fun. Damned if we didn't. My god, I really miss going fishing. Well, you can come with me and George any time you want to. Aw, I'd just get in the way. No, you wouldn't get in the way. We'd rig up the special chair in that boat. I would, too. Don't lie to me. Mike Tremaine ain't no good at it. Wouldn't be no fun without Carter, anyway. Damn death. Damn it straight to hell. Taking things away from a fella. Don't give a damn thing, just takes away. Took away Carter, took away Franklin. You remember my boy, Franklin, don't you, Matt? Yes sir, I sure do. Killed in 1942. Flying a B-17. Crashed in Florida, in a by god training flood. God, what a waste. Yes, sir. Well, ol' dicken death. [inaudible] an old fella like me, it takes a fine young man like Franklin, and buries him in some stinkin' swamp. I kept having dreams about Franklin after he was killed. I see his airplane in the water. He's calling me to help him get out. Yeah. Well, colonel, I'd better be going. I should get that fence done before dark. You and George ever fish that big cove over to my place on the lake? Oh, yes, sir. There's a lot of nice bass in there, but they're awful hard to get to. - Brushy, ain't it? - Very brushy. Yes, sir. - Yeah. That's cause I don't let anybody fool around with it. Floyd wanted to put a boathouse up there one time, but I said hell no, leave it the way it is. It's better that way. Uh, colonel, I know it ain't none of my business, but could I ask you something about that place? Sure, Mike. What do you want to know? Well, sir, it's about that spot we went out there and looked at today. Was there a sure enough town there once? Well, not a town, exactly. More of like, a settlement, you might say? Settlement? That's right. Way back before I went to the Philippines. I was working here, then, on my Daddy's ranch. Yeah, out at the Seven Spears. That's right. My daddy's a tough old bugger. Had my ass in the saddle from by god dawn to dusk. Well, sir, old Charlie Parsons and me was holed up in a little shack one time, right out of the cross where Lake Bradleyville is now. Yeah? And we seen five or six wagon loads of people set up right across our fence line. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Turned out those folks were some kind of religious outfit. They had bought up the land, moved out on it to form a farming community. Well, I never heard nothing about that. Ain't many people still around that remembers them. Building some houses, and put 'em up a great barn they called their community storehouse. Huh. Well, what kind of religion was it? Can't remember no more. Damn sure weren't no Baptists. My god. We really had some dandy dances in that barn. One of the farmers was a fella named Jenae, and he had two of the prettiest daughters you ever seen. They looked pretty good to you boys, didn't they? You're damn right they did. Charlie Parsons and me started courting up with them two gals right off the bat. The Jenae girls? Yeah, Marie and Suzette. It's French, you see. That's why them girls had pretty names like that. Damn, that Suzette it was a good looking girl. Kinda short, and blondish hair. A tiny little waist. Could put both hands right like nothing at all. I've seen a lot of girls, Mike. I've seen 'em in the Philippines, I've seen 'em in Mexico. I've seen the mademoiselles over in France. But none of 'em, never any place, was as by god good looking as that little Suzette Jenae from right out yonder on that farm. God, I was crazy about that girl. Bet you didn't know that, did ya? No, sir. I was mooning around about her one time-- fell off my horse, right into a stocktake. Well, what happened to all them people? I mean, there ain't nobody out there now. It went bust. Dried up. Done pretty good for a couple of years. Made good crops. And then we-- then this damn dry spell, and it finished 'em. Every family just packed up and pulled out. Well, what about Suzette? She went with 'em. Well, didn't you try to stop her? Sure, I did. But she said she had to go with the folks. Set up another community someplace else. I never saw her again. Never again. And later on, after I took up my commission, went out to the Philippines, my daddy bought up that land. Had the houses knocked down. Later on, they dammed up the creek to make Lake Bradleyville, so where the farms was, all underwater now. Them foundations up on the little rise? Yeah? That's where I was a young fella in love, once. That's why I don't let anybody fool around with it. I have to keep it, for remembering. It's important to an old fella like me, having places that stay the same, for remembering, and all. Yes, sir. I reckon so. I don't mean to say nothing about Floyd and Franklin's mama. Elizabeth was a good woman. Just, uh-- I don't remember the same way as Suzette. Yeah. Miss Kincaid is real nice. Yeah. Didn't even mind what Brewster and Floyd done with the Seven Spears. Breaking it up like that to drill them oil wells, bringing them fat ass stock, them damn, stinking sheep. Yeah. And by god, I made them leave the Jenae farm alone. Bumble-dickin' money grubbers. Maureen? You home yet? Aw, hell. Floyd's back. Oh, howdy dad. Mike. How was the drive? Pretty good, Mr. Kincaid. We drove out to the Colonel's place, out on the lake. - Oh, is that right? - Yeah. You know, Dad, I want to talk to you about that a little later. Talk about what? That place out on the lake. What about it? Mike, you finish that fence yet? Well, no, sir. See, me and the Colonel didn't get back till about-- You ain't getting it done hanging around in here, Mike. Hell, it's going plum dark now, and it isn't done yet. Well, I'll get it done tomorrow for sure. I know that. Just isn't getting it done today, Mike. Yes, sir. Why don't you shut the hell up? I told Mike to forget that damn fence, so don't talk to him. Now, Dad, I don't want you keeping Mike from his chores. There's too much work to do around here without you wasting Mike's time. Why don't you do some of it? Daddy worked my butt off, and you don't do a damn thing. Yeah, that's right, Daddy. Mike, when you come out here in the morning, I want you to go buy the feed store and pick some oats. And tell that damn fool Milo Crawford that I want by god oats, and not chicken mash. - Yes, sir. You go on out in the ranch and mark them damn sheep you're so far proud of. Well, I'd better be getting on home, Mr. Kincaid. Colonel, so long. So long, there, Mike. Enjoyed the talk. Me, too. Don't forget them oats. Yes, sir. Damn nice boy. I used to go fishing with his daddy. Bet you didn't know that, did ya? Sure, Dad. You told me. Old Carter Tremaine. Hooked me in the ear with a plug one time. Yeah, I know. Hurt like hell. Franklin was out there with us, not more than six years old. Kept yelling, Daddy's been gaffed, Daddy's been gaffed. Dad, if you can be still for a minute, I need to talk to you. Weren't no gaff, it was only a little fish hook. Now, please, Dad, let me-- Daddy's been gaffed! Dad, I need to talk to you. Go ahead. Who's stopping you? You are, with that damn silly story. What's so damn silly about it? My ear's sore as hell. Of course, you don't care nothing about that, do you? Of course I do. It's just-- Franklin cared. Cried and cried, cause his daddy's hurt. Dad, almighty, that happened years ago. I still got the by god scar. Well, Carter and Franklin are dead now, so forget about it. That's right. Franklin's gone now. In that damn swamp. Boy's gone. My good boy, that cried when I was hurt. Sure, sure. Wouldn't let me see his body, you know? But I knew. I knew what it looked like. I've seen an Englishman's body, and his plane crashed near our trench. Tore all to pieces. I know what it's like to fall, so I-- I didn't need to see Franklin. I knew. All right. All right. Listen, just forget about Franklin. Can't forget. It keeps coming into my mind. Dammit, Dad, listen to me! - Who are you yelling at? - You. I'm yelling at you. Where do you get off, yelling at your daddy? That ain't a way for a boy to act. I know, Dad-- I never yelled at my daddy! He'd have beat my butt off with a fencepost. Dad. Bet Maurseen said something about me. Well, whatever she said I done, I've never done it. Makes up things, that woman does. Makes them up. She and that dark Sickenger girl. Now, don't get started on Maureen. She takes good care of you. Don't care a damn about me. Cares about parties. Gossip, new cars, and parties. Oh, Maureen-- Been sitting around the country club, she's sitting around making up stories about me. Oh, Maureen ain't said nothing about you. That's cause she don't like me. What? You don't talk about me cause you don't like me. Well, you just said she-- What the hell are we sitting around gassing about Maureen for? I thought you wanted to ask me something? Yeah, that's right. I do. Well, go ahead. I sure as hell ain't going no place. Bumble dickin' wheelchair. Can't even go fishing. Now, Dad-- ah-- I wanted to talk to you about the Jenae farm. What about it? Well, Clarence Sickenger and I were down talking to old man Colors at the bank today. I heard about it. What'd he beat you out of? Nothing. Don't believe it. Now, Clarence and I are thinking about going into a little development project. Oh, you are, are ya? Yeah. Well, I'm gonna lay it right on the line, Dad. We want to do something with that Jenae farm property. The hell, you say? You can't touch that land. It's mine. Now, Dad, don't get excited. Now, just hear me out. Don't want to hear you out. I told you when you took over my half of the Kincaid properties, you could do anything you damn well wanted to with 'em, but you're to keep your hands off the Jenae farm. Ain't that right? - Yes, sir, that's right. - Well, there you are. But Dad, that lake property's damn valuable. Naw, it ain't. The only person it's valuable to is me. Well, why, for god's sake? What the hell you got out there, a gold mine, or something? None of your damn business. I got my reasons for wanting that property, and that, by god's, enough. Will, it ain't enough for me. Well, it damn well better be. Dad-- listen. Clarence has been going over to Dallas to talk to an architect. Now, they've come up with an idea for portioning off that land into two acre plots. Now, with his property and the Jenae farm joined together, Clarence and I will own the whole north side of the lake. Who the hell would want two acre plots? Lots of people. What the hell for? Nobody in the world could make a living farming on two acres. Unless it's one of them damn Chinamen, or something. Oh, it ain't for foreigners. Bringing in the Chinamen. That's what you're aiming to do. The by god yellow peril, right here, right here in Bradleyville. Oh, for god's-- I'll fight it! See if I don't. I'll round up my lodge brothers. We'll fortify the land with trenches and barbed wires, shooting the yellow backsides of every by god Chinaman you bring around here. We ain't bringing in any Chinamen, dammit! Now, these are going to be exclusive summer homes. - Summer homes? - That's right. And we can make a fortune. We've got enough money now. We could-- we could dredge out that cove, and put in the biggest damn marina you ever seen. You can't have the Jenae farm. Now, we're going to call it Mumford County Estates. We're going have a nine hole golf course, water skiing, skeet shooting, horseback riding, a private club-- the works. Mumford County Estates? Who come up with that one? Clarence. That figures. I recollect Sickenger's related old Governor Mumford. Well, I don't know if they are-- Why'd they ever name this county after old Governor Mumford is beyond me. Should have named it Kincaid County. That's right, Dad. I ain't proud to be from Texas. I'm proud to be from Bradleyville. But I sure as hell ain't a damn bit proud to be from Mumford County. All right, all right. How would you like to walk up to a fella and have to say, howdy, I'm Clarence Sickenger, up from Mumford County? Now, what about the project, Dad? What project? The lake project. Frilly, sad ass waste of time. Ruin land putting on a by god carnival. Dad, we'll have folks moving in here from all over the country. Raise the land, don't work the land, don't do nothing but throw a beer bottle, and a little piece of paper over it. No, not if you control it. You see, you make it exclusive, and you control it. The only way to control crap like that is not to let it happen at all. But Dad, I need that land. Now, Clarence is going back to Dallas to get-- hell's fire, we want to get started on this thing. You can't have the Jenae farm. Well, it beats the hell out of me why you hang onto that piece of property. Hell, you ain't growing or grazing nothing out there. The damn land's just going to sea. All right if it does. That land is mine, and by god, it's going to stay just like it is! Dad, if you'd just listen to me for a minute-- I ain't listenin'. You can't have that land. That is an order, and that is a fact. It's like trying to talk to a damn brick wall! Sure is nice to be home again. You miss all this shouting and yelling out in the big, wide world. You stay out of this! Out of what? Hell, I just got here. I don't want to talk no more. I'm tired, and want to go to my room. Here. Let me help you, Colonel. I don't need no help. I can run this damn thing myself. I'll have Ida Ruth bring in your supper out here. I don't want any supper! Leave me alone, dammit! What's got him so riled up tonight? Hell, I don't know. He's been on the peck all afternoon. Mhm. Y'all wouldn't have been discussing the lake development plan, by any chance? We might have mentioned it once or twice. Trust Clarence to come up with a dimwitted name like Mumford County. Oh, hell, ain't nothing settled yet. That's just an idea. Mhm. An idea that the Colonel obviously didn't take too kindly to. Well, he'll come around. He never likes anything the first time he hears it. You really think it's a good idea? Floyd? I mean, let's face it-- Lake Bradleyville isn't exactly my idea of the fun spot of the southwest. All that's out there is some old boat docks, and a bait stand run by somebody named Bullwin Cassidy. Yeah, well that's why it's so perfect. He'll fire, there's a big lake out there. And it's practically untouched. Now, the way Clarence and I got it figured is we're only going to cater to money people. Big money people. Mumford County Estates is going to be exclusive, baby. Rich and exclusive. Rich and exclusive? Well, there it is. The Bradleyville Country Club motto, rich and exclusive. The whole, hollow, useless thing all over again. A lake full of rich and exclusive sag-bellied, loudmouth bores. Waterski, bass boats, criss crafts-- everything that rich and exclusive can buy. You're damn right they're going to buy. What's wrong with that? The way it is, that land's just going to waste. This way, the Colonel gets his ceremony, you get your picture in Life magazine, and old Floyd kicks off a million dollar deal. It's a perfect plan. Perfect-- except for one thing. COLONEL: Dammit to hell, where's my supper? Are you all trying to starve me to death out here? Him. [applause] [country music] RADIO: This coming Saturday, the Buffalo Gap volunteer fire department. They're going to be having their big annual fish fry. It's like I always say, if there's anything that volunteer firemen do better than fight fires, it's fry fish. So why don't you come on over? They'll start serving at 11:00. Weather-wise today, well, it's going to be another hot one, with the highs getting close to 100 degrees. Friends, it's music time again. Here's Floyd Kramer. [music playing] Colonel? Ida Ruth, make sure there's enough ice. I've already checked the bar. Colonel? Wake up. Not a turn on guard again? Hell's fire, I just turned in. Wake up, Colonel. What the hell you want? Time to wake up, Colonel. Floyd and Major Ketchum will be here any minute. Major who? Major Ketchum, the commandant out at the military school. I never heard of him. Why, of course you heard of him. My god, Floyd spent all day yesterday explaining everything to you. That's why you put on your uniform, remember? Sure, sure, I remember. I'm the oldest living graduate, or some damn thing. That's right. Outlived every damn one of 'em! Bet you didn't know that, did ya? Why, of course I [inaudible]. Every damn one of 'em. That's right, Colonel. Probably don't sound like much, but then, you ain't never done it, have you? No, Colonel, I never-- never, never did. Cause you ain't old enough. How old are you, anyway? I'm 42 years old, Colonel. You ain't as old as I am, but you're getting there, ain't ya, kid? Faster than you think. That's cause you don't take proper care of yourself. Check your feet today? My feet? Yes, dammit, your feet! Proper foot hygiene will save your life one of these days. I'll remember that next time I go over the top. Yeah. Always have the men check their feet. Good for you, Colonel. Who'd you say is coming to see me? Oh-- Major Ketchum. Commandant out at the military school. Wonder how come the commandant ain't nothing but a little old piddly butted major? I wouldn't know, Colonel. Always had a general for a commandant when I was there. Is that a fact? Yep. Ex-Confederate general. Huh. One of old Robert's boys, right? Who? Robert E. Lee. Hell no, weren't Robert E. Lee. What would Robert E. Lee be doing in a little ol' south Texas military school? Use your head, woman. I didn't say that. Be like putting Blackjack Pearce in charge of a National Guard army, or some damn thing. What I meant was-- Of course, I wouldn't put it past 'em. Bumble-dickin' government dumb butts. They just-- treated us boys like dirt after we got home. Cut off all the by god whiskey, took away the jobs. Whooped the Hun for 'em, they turned on us. Sure, Colonel. Sure. President Wilson's wife was running the by god country. Bet you didn't know that, did you? Well, no. Yeah, women voting, women running for office. Women in their fat cans, in the voting booth. Most of the fat cans I ever seen around the old voting booth are wearing Levis. The hell's that supposed to mean? MAN: Good evening. Thank you. Dad, I'd like you to meet Major Leroy W. Ketchum. Colonel JC Kincaid. It's indeed a pleasure, sir. Glad to know you. And this is my wife, Maureen. Glad to meet you. My pleasure, ma'am. Yes, indeed, my pleasure. Everything's a pleasure with this fella, huh? Colonel, Mrs. Kincaid, I'd like you to meet one of our boys. This is Cadet [inaudible] Whopper Turnbull. Glad to meet you, Colonel. Mrs. Kincaid, ma'am. Mighty damn. You see him whip out that salute there, Floyd? Yes, sir. Boy, you really can step it out there, boy. Thank you, sir. Cadet Sergeant Turnbull's one of our most promising men. He's a real product of Mirabeau B. Lamar. Damn fine looking soldier. Thank you, sir. Well, you've all got business to talk over, so I'll just toddle on out. Real pleasure, ma'am. I know. How come you're wearing them boots, boy? They bringing back the horse cavalry? No, sir. These are standard dress uniform requirements at Mirabeau B. Lamar, sir. We feel it gives the boys pride, and military bearing. I served in the cavalry with old Blackjack Pearce back in 1916. Bet you didn't know that, did you? Yes, sir. I've done an in-depth study of your military career, Colonel. Old Blackjack. There's a general for you, and every inch a soldier. I remember we was chasing a little old greaser pancho villa down in Mexico. Well, sir, I was having me a cup of coffee in the officer's mess-- hot as hell that day. The wind was blowing the tent sides back and forth, flap, flap, flap. Yeah. Dad-- Dad, I think it's time to go over the agenda now. - Cadet Turnbull, the agenda. - Yes, sir! Cavalry wasn't no damn good in France, though. Machine guns saw to that. Used horses to pull wagons and artillery, but no by god horse cavalry. Now, then, colonel, about 1:00-- And a horse drawn ammunition convoy was shelled one time. God, what a mess. Dad, the major's trying to give you the-- Poor, poor horse was blown apart right in the tracers. I seen one with his back broke, trying to pull itself forward with its two front feet, crying like a baby. Dammit, Dad, come to. Another with his stomach shot out. Running around in little circles, crying and screaming. Stepping on his own guts. My god. Easy there, Turnbull. Colonel, we've all seen our share of war's hell. Now it's time to bend our attention to the affairs-- Stay out of the cavalry, sonny boy. You ain't got a chance against heavy artillery machine guns. Mr. Kincaid, could you please get the colonel to attend to the matter? Dad, dammit, to pay attention, will ya? To what? You ain't said nothing. Fooling around and wasting my time. I got a lodge meeting to go to. Get on with the catch up. That's a by god order. Right, Colonel Kincaid. Now, according to your son, the site of the ceremony will be the, uh, Bradleyville Country Club? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, well, what the hell? Well, we'll have the cadet band here, of course. They'll start the proceedings with the national anthem, followed by the Spirit of Mirabeau B. Lamar, and then a rousing rendition of Dixie. I will then introduce Captain Scott, who's my adjutant, and he will call the roll of the class of 1905. After the first five names are called, taps will be played. Then Colonel Kincaid will be introduced. He'll be wheeled in by Cadet Turnbull. Turnbull? Sit down. Yes, sir. Turnbill will be escorted by picked members of the honor guard. Then the band will play over there. Don't like that damn song, "Yanks Are Coming." We were by god dough boys over there, not yanks. You call a Texas boy yank over there, you're looking to get your head bashed in with a Springfield. Well, of course, Colonel, we'll play any song you want. You know how we used to sing that song? (SINGING) We'll be over. We're coming over. But we won't come back. We'll be buried over there. That's how we used to sing it. What song do you want, Colonel? How about "The Old Gray Mare?" That's what we sang when we crossed the Marne back in 1918. Well, somehow I think that would be, uh, hardly appropriate. (SINGING) Rather be a colonel with an eagle on your shoulder, or a private with a chicken on his knee. Well-- Mademoiselle from Armentieres, parlez vous? Mademoiselle from Armentieres, parlez vous? Mademoiselle from Armentieres, hdan't been fit in 40 years. Hinky dinky, parlez vous. How you like that, sonny boy? Yeah, that's good. That's good. You can sing that to the boys in the barracks. They'll get a kick out of it. TURNBULL: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. - Turnbull? Yes, sir? Uh, what about "The Eyes Of Texas?" Excellent suggestion. (SINGING) There's a long, long nail sticking into the sole of my shoe. Very funny, Colonel. Now, after the colonel has been wheeled into place, I will introduce the rest of our honor graduates. Yeah? Who are they? Well, let's see. We have, uh-- we have two congressmen, four state senators, an ex-lieutenant governor. All them fellas graduated from Mirabeau B. Lamar? That's correct, sir. Makes my little class of 1905 seem kind of piddling, don't it? Why, of course not. Well, then, of course, most of us is dead, ain't we? Well, yeah. Well-- you know, we've, uh-- we've produced not only many gallant soldiers and public servants of Mirabeau B. Lamar, but also several prominent Texas businessmen as well. Money people, huh? There you are, Floyd. Got somebody to talk to now. Floyd here's our big plan maker. Summer home magnate. Ain't that right? Yes, don't get started on that, Dad. Go on, Major. Well, after I've finished the list of honored graduates, then Cadet Turnbull will give a synopsis of Colonel Kincaid's career. Good for you, sonny. Thank you, sir. When do I get to say something? Well, you don't, Dad. Why the hell not? Well, it's just not on the agenda, that's all. I want to talk about being down in Mexico with old Blackjack. Yeah, that's what we're afraid of. The hell's that supposed to mean? I'll by god say something if I want to. Who's the oldest living graduate around here, me or you? - Well, you are. - Damn right. I am. Oldest living graduate. Got a list of others fellas there, eh, boy? Other fellas, sir? Who the hell did I outlive, anyway? You mean you don't know, sir? Can't remember no more. Kinda recollect one fella. Fat kid named-- Tom something. We called him Butter Butt. He on the list? Cadet Turnbull, read the list. Yes, sir. Captain Hobert A. Lowery, Killeen, Texas. USCM. - Oh, Bert Lowery. Old Hobey. Sure, I remember him. Killed in action June 25, 1918 at Below Wood. Killed? Colonel Stanley L. Womack, Austin, Texas. US Army. What's the name again? Colonel Stanley L. Womack. Can't remember him. Killed in action July 18, 1918 at [inaudible]. Can't remember. Captain Thomas R. Milton, Waco, Texas. US Army. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's him. That's the guy. Tom Milton. Old Butter Butt. That's the guy. Tom Milton. Uh, killed in action, September 12, 1918 at Saint-Mihel. Saint-Mihel, I was there, too. Hey, Dad, that's enough of that. Now, let's get on to something else-- No, not here. Read the rest of the list, sonny boy. Yes, sir. Uh, Colonel Leonard H. Campell, San Antonio, Texas. US Army. - Campbell. Sure. Dad April 7, 1950 in Albuquerque, New Mexico Veteran's Hospital of lung damage caused by mustard gas fumes sustained in the Argonne Forest Defensive, September of 1918. God almighty. Poor old Len. Dr. Quentin Tillery, Pampa, Texas. Poor, poor old Len. Uh, civilian doctor, killed by the Japanese. Manila, 1942. Old Butter Butt. Old Len Campbell. Let me see that list. Yes, sir. Stanley Womack. Can't remember him. Quentin Tillery. Quentin Tillery. Can't seem to get him. You got a picture, or anything? No, Colonel. I'm sorry. We had us a fire at the school in 1939. Destroyed all the old photographs. Can't seem to recollect these fellas. Well, that's a shame, Dad, but listen-- wait till you hear about the memorial service we got planned. I'm the only one left among these boys. Boys like this young fella here. How come you never told me before? How come I never knew before I was the only one left? Well, you did, Dad. I explained everything to you 100 times. Well, this is different. This is a whole lot different. Well, it doesn't matter, Dad. The hell it don't. According to this paper here, Len Campbell was in a damn veteran's hospital for over 30 years, and I never knew it. Now, Colonel, if you'd called the school, we would have been glad to tell you of his whereabouts. I just let everything slip by. I let the whole thing slip by. Well, Dad-- Dad, listen, now you can make up for it. These men's relatives are gonna want to see you, talk to you about when you all were boys. Lowery-- Tom Milton, killed in France. Means he's still there. That's right. Big American cemetery, Verdun. Army just marched off and left them there, under all them damn white crosses. I seen 'em. I seen 'em when Elizabeth and I went back to France in 1930. Raining the day we got there, and the cemetery was empty, except for me and Elizabeth, and all them boys going west. Walked around the rain. About the damnedest storm I ever known. cry. That's right. Stood there with all them damn crosses, and cried. Cried for Missouri, and Ohio, and Texas, and Pennsylvania, and all of them. All them cities, and towns, and states them boys would never see again. Cause they was machine gunned, and gasses, and blown apart, making the by god world safe for democracy. Bet you didn't know that, did you? Yes, sir. I read that in your biography, sir. Safe for democracy? Whatever the blue balled wonder that is. But, whatever it is, we done it, and done the hell out of it. Then I went over to Fort Douaumont. Them damn frauds are selling souvenirs. That's right, souvenirs. Ain't that the way of things? Pull a fella's bacon out of the fire, turns around and sells their drippings. Had a little stand there, with old rusted canteens and bayonets, little pieces of barbed wire. Fella with me-- American fella, too. Paid $25 for an old, busted Enfield rifle. Said he wanted a memento of what it must have been like during the fighting there. I told him to stick that Enfield up his butt sideways, walk barefoot on the stickery side of the street during the Armistice Day Parade. That'd give him an idea what it was like. Now, now, Colonel, I don't think you're taking a very military attitude toward all this, now. The hell with your military attitude. You wasn't there, dammit. Dad, please. Now, now, Colonel, we have to talk about a little ceremony here. - To hell with it. Get your ass out of here, and take your by god orphan graduate with you. I don't want it. Don't want any part of it! Ain't worth it. Ain't worth a bumble dickin' thing. Ain't no honor to be the oldest living anything. Oldest living graduate, oldest living Indian, oldest living armadillo. Oldest living nothing. It just means you're standing around, looking at the next oldest whippersnapper, wondering where the hell everybody went. Now, Dad, you're not backing out of this, now? We're going to have this ceremony, and you're going to be there, or I'm gonna by god know the reason why. The reason why-- the reason why is I flat ass don't want to. And what's more, ain't going to. Well, you damn sure are. I see no point in prolonging this, Mr. Kincaid. It's rather obvious that the colonel isn't gonna be interested in our little ceremony. Yes, he is. He really is. He's going to be right there with us. I guarantee you that. Damn sure won't, and I guarantee you that. Well, that's about it, Mr. Kincaid. I think Cadet Turnbull and I better be going now. Thank you very much for your hospitality. If you're ever down in Galveston, look us up, will you? Colonel Kincaid, my compliments, sir. Now, wait a minute, Ketchum. We made a deal. Without the colonel, there can be no deal. And I have my position to think of. I can't bring all the people down here to Bradleyville to honor a man who isn't even going to attend the ceremony. No. The festivities will be held in Galveston, as originally planned, I think. Well, it's been a pleasure, Mr. Kincaid. Be sure and say goodbye to that lovely wife of yours for me, will you? Come on, Turnbull. Now, wait a minute, Ketchum. Look-- look, we got us all these plans. We got a fish fry at the lake, we got cocktail parties. Well, you did it, didn't you? You messed up the whole damn thing for me. What the hell's it got to do with you? Ain't none of your because if I don't want to go to that ceremony. Oh, yes, it is. That's exactly what it is, business. I don't know what you're talking about. I gotta go to my lodge meeting. Well, I'll tell you what I'm talking about. Those people that were coming down here-- those people you just told to get the hell out of here were important to me. Important to the lake project. - Lake project? Yes, the lake project. Land-- that land is mine, and I told you, you can't have it. Will you quit telling me what I can and can't have? I've been taking care of this family for 17 years. 17 years. Me, dammit, not you. Now by god, from now on, what I say goes! That lake deal, that military school deal. Everything! From now on, I'm telling you what is by god what. And that, Colonel, that is an order, and that is a fact! You mind your tongue, boy. You just mind your tongue! Franklin never talked to me like that! To hell with Franklin! I'm sick to death of hearing about him. You've shoved him down my throat ever since we were boys. Your precious, by god Franklin. You want to know what Franklin was really like? You really want to know? He was a stuck up, smarty ass twerp. My beloved big brother. You know, my first day in high school, he sicced his buddies on me, and they took my pants off in front of that whole school. And I was laying there in the dirt, just so ashamed, I couldn't move. And he was laughing. Laughing harder than all the rest. God, I hated his guts. And you put him on some pedestal 40 feet high. Franklin, the star. Football, basketball, track, baseball. The Bradleyville Flash. Isn't that what everybody called him? And you want to know something else? When old Flash bought it in that B-17, I was happy as hell. Because I knew if he lived out that war and came home some kind of hero, I could-- kiss my life goodbye. I always tried to be fair to you, Floyd. Fair? You mean fair like you was today? That had to do with my life, not yours. That had to do with me, and-- things I can't ever go back to. Things I forgot to do. Well, what have I ever asked you to do that was so damn difficult? I mean, what is so terrible about being honored by your old school in your own hometown? What honor? What kind of honor is there in a world where a boy can dishonor his dead brother, and try to shame his own daddy? Oh, god, Daddy, I-- I gotta get out of here. Floyd? Floyd! I'm gonna be late for my lodge meeting! Floyd! Here, Colonel. I brought you a drink. Whiskey? Whiskey. I don't like whiskey. Suit yourself. Floyd's kinda mad at me. Yeah. I heard everything from the kitchen. What was you doing out in the kitchen? Oh, boozing it up a bit. Knocking back a few, was you? A few. You know, Colonel, I don't blame you one little bit. What do you mean? I wouldn't want to be the bumble dickin' oldest living graduate, either. That ain't no way for a lady to talk. Hell with it. I'm a member of this by god family, and I'll talk any way I want to. Go ahead. I don't guess it matters. Hey, Colonel, cheer up. Hell, the world ain't come to an end. Even if it has, you can bet your boots Bradleyville will be the last place to find out. It's mortifying to have your boy get on you like that. It ain't natural. It's downright mortifying. Well, why not let him have what he wants? Well, by god, I said I wasn't going with that ceremony, and I meant it. Oh, I don't mean that rooty-tooty boys' school baloney. Floyd deserved that. He played in about halfway crooked, got stung on the deal. I even let myself get dumb ideas about it. No, what I'm talking about is your lake property. He can't have the Jenae farm. Why not? Cause it's mine, and I want to keep it. Things about it I remember from the old times. Things I used to love. Love, eh? There's a word hasn't been used around this place in quite a while. You just don't understand. Sure, I understand, Colonel, but you gotta understand about Floyd. He needs that land because he needs his project to keep going. I don't know what you're talking about. My god, Colonel. Look at him. Look at us, rattling around this big old house with absolutely no purpose in life at all. The Kincaid interests run themselves. Floyd's foremen and managers do all the work. He just drives around and looks at things, or sits around that damn country club and bets on the ball games. He needs the deals he's going to make to keep from going nuts. Oh, the housing, boat docks he's going to build. All that big business, hokey pokey under the table baloney. It's up to you to give it to him. Give away everything? Everything but the Jenae farm. I'm damned if everybody didn't want that. Not everybody, Colonel. Where's Floyd? I'll be late for my lodge meeting. Let him have it, Colonel. Let him have that damn land. What's going on in here? Nothing, Floyd. Absolutely nothing at all. I'm gonna be late for my lodge meeting. Come on, Colonel. I'll drive you into town. No, no. Never mind. I'll do it. About by god time. I want to shuffle me some dominoes. Yeah, yeah, all right. I'll get you right on into town. Be careful. What are you doing? Dammit, you ain't pushing a load of alfalfa! [applause] MARTHA ANN: Little old thing I ever heard of. It's just funny. A real resort area, right here in little old Bradleyville. Clarence and Floyd are gonna run the whole thing. Clarence here says that we're just gonna make lots of money. Ain't that right, honey? That's right. MARTHA ANN: All them houses right off there, in Lake Bradleyville. Imagine. How'd Floyd's meeting go today with that, uh, major what's his name? Oh, it was something else. We'd better wait till Floyd gets home to tell you about it. I think it's real nice how Floyd gives up his own time to take his daddy up to the lodge meetings. Yeah. He's crazy about it. Getting all them big shots up here to Bradleyville could be one hell of a kickoff for Mumford County Estates. I suppose Floyd told you about that? In-depth, Clarence. Clarence told me all about these exciting new plans. Well, I could just hardly believe it. I mean, the Colonel having his little old ceremony, giving Floyd his lake property, and all that. Well, my goodness, that's where his little spooky town is, ain't it? The very spot. See there, Clarence? I told you so. Hell, there ain't no damn town out there on that property. Just two or three broken down foundations. Mhm. How do you know? Cause I went out there and had a look-see. You mean you got out of your car? And actually walked around out there? I mean, right on the ground, and all? Well, hell yes. How else would I have seen 'em? Well, I just can't picture you walking around anywhere, Clarence. Getting your boots dusty, and all. I mean, you're the only guy I know that plays nine holes of golf, and never gets out of his cart. Like some weird kind of polo. Aw-- come off it, Maureen. I get plenty of exercise. Clarence does his exercises every morning. He even rodeos every now and then. Don't you, honey? Mhm. I saw him last 4th of July. He was the only member of the sheriff's party that was riding on a Clydesdale. [laughter] What the hell are you laughing at? On a Clydesdale? Don't you get it? Yeah, I get it. Clydesdale's one of them great big ol' plow horses! Dammit, I said I got it! Now let it go, will ya? Then why didn't ya laugh? Cause I didn't think it was funny. Don't mind him, Maureen. He's just grouchy about his ol' Mumforddale. You're damn right I am. I'm ready to go on it, and I still don't know what Floyd's doing. I told you, he'd tell you when he gets back. Yeah, well, I wish he'd hurry up. I'm sick of waiting around on him. Don't you like the company, Clarence? Some of it's all right. FLOYD: Hello! I'm back. We're out in the den, Floyd. Yeah, well, this figures. I think I'm gonna rent out that damn living room to borders. Where you been? Doesn't take till this long, usually, to, you know-- Busted a damn fan belt. Lucky thing I was there by the Texaco station, or I wouldn't be home yet. How'd that military school thing go today? Well, I want to talk to you about that, Clarence. That's why I'm here. We've got troubles. What kinda troubles? Well, Dad won't go for it. He flat refuses to have anything to do with it. That means all them people ain't coming here to Bradleyville, that right? Yeah, that's about it. Uh-huh. They still going to have the ceremony? Yeah. Down in Galveston. OK. We'll go down there. What? Well, you've still got a foot in the door. Go to Galveston, present the Colonel's regrets, and take the bows for him. I had some sketches made up of Mumford County Estates when I was in Dallas. You can take them along, corner those boys down there, and do some business with 'em. My god, Clarence. I'm surprised at you. That's almost smart. Ain't he something else, now? Thank you. Get off my neck, will you? My god, we'll do it, Clarence. That's a damn fine idea. Smart as a whip. Hey-- will you get away? I was just trying to give you a little old kiss, that's all. Yeah, well, do it later. I'm busy now. Oh, naughty you. Do you hear that, Maureen? Yeah, I heard that. Cut out that dirty talk, will you, Clarence? What dirty talk? I never said nothing. He said later, Floyd. You know what that means, don't you? No. You do, too. Martha Ann, will you please shut up? Tick a lock. That's better. Now, Floyd, what about that land of the Colonel's? Well, I think I've got the news for us on that, Clarence. I had a long talk with Dad, and I think he's going to come across. Yes, sir, I think he's going to be right in there with us. That's not good enough, Floyd. I'm meeting with some people down at the bank tomorrow, and I can't go in there with a maybe. What people? Dammit, Clarence, you're not trying to drill around me, are you? I'm not trying to drill around anybody. I'm just trying to get this damn outfit on its feet, that's all. Well, I don't like the idea of you meeting people about this deal without me being there. Look, I didn't include you because you're supposed to be making the arrangements for that damn military school business. That's right, Floyd. You always bring the barbecue, remember? Can't you shut her up? Will you stay out of this, Maureen? Stay out? Hell-- he's gonna get this business deal on its feet, all right. And one of them feet's going to be right on your neck. Now, that's a damn lie! Floyd went into this business with his eyes wide open. This whole project is split 50-50, and don't you forget it. Now listen, Floyd, this outfit is going to go through. But the arrangement has got to be between you and me. You and me, you understand? So just muzzle that woman you've got over there, and tell her to keep her nose out of this. You wait just a minute, Clarence. You be by god careful how you talk about Maureen. Then you keep her off my back, Floyd! Boys! Boys, this is silly. My goodness, let's not squabble. Yeah, let's not find about anything silly like old Maureen. I mean, what the hell? Well, I don't think it's nice to fight. After all, look at all the pretty things you're gonna buy when we make all that money. I wish you'd quit talking like we're living out on the by god poor farm. Hell's fire, you've got a house full of pretty things now. Pestered me to death to buy her that damn sports car out in St. Angelo. I just love that little car, Maureen. I call it my buzz buggy. Ain't that cute? Yeah. Cute. Now, Floyd, what about that property of the Colonel's? I ain't got a full length mink coat, though. What? Mavis Purnell's got one. Will you please quit harping about that damn coat? I told you you couldn't have one, and that's that. Listen, why don't you girls go to a movie, or out to the country club, or something? Clarence and I are trying to talk business. Y'all are just getting in the way. Yeah, that's the damn truth. Hey, Martha Ann, how about taking a buzz buggy and whizzing over to Red Grover's bar? It's supposed to be the hottest spot in town. You stay out of that dive. How about it, Martha Ann? Oh, no. I'd be scared to go in there. Couldn't be any worse than one of them knee grabbing, fanny pinching Saturday night dances out at the country club. Right, Clarence? Now, what the hell's that supposed to mean? Maureen, will you get off it, please? I'm sorry. Now listen, Clarence, like I was telling you, I'm-- I'm pretty sure Dad's going to come across, but I can't say exactly when. Now, that's the best I can do. I don't think so. Well, I'm telling you, Clarence, that's how it is. Is it? I don't know why, Floyd, old boy, but for some damn reason, you're trying to hold out on me. What the hell you talking about? You know damn good and well what I'm talking about. Now, what is it? You want out of the deal, or something? Out of the deal? No. I don't know what you're talking about. Uh-huh. Listen, Floyd, when did you take over your dad's half of the Kincaid interests? 1945. Listen, Clarence-- - Yeah. And before that, your uncle Brewster handled everything. Ain't that so? - Yeah, well-- Yes. According to Brewster, he had run things, because your dad had some kind of-- spells after he'd come back from the war. Ain't that right? Yeah, that's right. What the hell are you talking about, Clarence? Floyd doesn't need the Colonel to give him a damn thing. Hell, that old man's had snakes in his boots ever since the World's War I. All Floyd does is go down to Judge Deckert, and take that piece of property. Ain't that right, Floyd? Floyd? - Yeah, that's right. Uh-huh. And just when did you do that little old thing? Last week. Floyd? That's what I figured. So the truth of the matter is we've got no problems at all. Yeah, I reckon so. You mean to tell me that you got your daddy to give you something that you already had? Now, that isn't the way it is, Maureen. You don't understand. Oh, I understand, all right. I understand all that military school business. I understand all that Mumford County Estates. Oh, brother, do I understand that. But what I don't understand is you, Floyd. You and your daddy, my god. I'll never forget the look on that old man's face after his meeting with that idiot major, and after you laid all that Franklin crap on him. All right, Maureen. Now, please-- I stuck by you through a lot, Floyd. But this time, you just-- pushed it too damn far. Well. I think, uh, Martha Ann and me better be, uh-- getting on back home. Yeah, Clarence, why don't you do that little old thing? I'll tell those fellas tomorrow we're ready to go. OK, Floyd? Yeah. Yeah, all right. That'll be fine. [laughter] Now, don't you be too hard on him, Maureen. After all, think of all the pretty things y'all are going to buy. You know, Clarence, if BS was music, you'd be a by god brass band. [applause] Come on, Martha Ann. Sure has been a lovely-- CLARENCE: Martha Ann! Are you gonna let me explain? Why bother? I just don't give a damn anymore. I wanted Daddy to give me something. Just-- give me something. Hm. Seems to me that's all he's ever done. No, dammit. No, he hasn't. He let me run things because he didn't have no choice in it, but he's never given me anything. I wanted him to let me have the Jenae farm because he wanted me to have it. Wanted to see me do something with it. Floyd, he still hasn't given it to you. You took it from him. - Well, I had to. Without that land in my name, this deal never would have got off the ground. I wanted him to think that he had turned it over to me. I wanted Clarence and them other fellas to think that Dad and me was in this thing together. I can make something out of that lake project. Maureen, I know I can. Everybody in the whole damn state will be impressed. You'll see. Why didn't you tell your daddy all this? I tried to. But he went off on one of his rampages again. Something about Chinamen, or something. I don't know. And then we got in a fight, as usual, and the whole damn thing just went up in smoke. But you're no better off now than you ever were. Now you-- tell the Colonel-- it ain't no use. Whatever you tell him, that property's gone. You've taken it. Well, just cause I took it doesn't mean it's gone. Hell's fire, I'm not gonna put it in my pocket and take it off anywhere. Him and his damn ghost town. Never was no town out there, just some kind of farming community. I looked that up in the courthouse records. Nobody even remembers who lived out there anymore. But the Colonel. Boy, the colonel really has got a thing about that place. You know, I thought maybe there were some people buried out there. People that he knew, and that he didn't want their graves disturbed. But I walked all over that place. I couldn't find no markers of any kind. Oh, hell, I don't know. Maybe I'd just better get a hold of Clarence, and tell him to forget the whole damn thing. No, Floyd, don't do that. You need this project. But you gotta tell your daddy the truth. You're into it now. You gotta face every part of it. Yeah, I guess so. You know, we could take a beating on this thing. I mean, the whole damn outfit could fall flat on its ass, and we could drop a bundle, you know? That's a hell of a possibility. I know, Floyd. I know. [phone ringing] Now, who the hell can that be? [phone ringing] Hello? What? Dammit to hell, Ramsey, talk slower. I can't understand anything you're saying. What? Oh my god. Well, listen, now, don't you all move him. I'll be right on down there. - What is it? - It's Daddy. He's had another one of those strokes, or something down at that damn lodge meeting. What? Listen, I got to get into town. You-- you call Doc Crowley and tell him to meet us at the hospital. If those stupid bastards at that damn lodge meeting had anything to do with this, I'm gonna have their hides. I'm gonna close that damn place, and I'm gonna kick some butts! You see if I don't! My god. What now? [applause] Well, now, everything's all set up in there for the Colonel. Oxygen tent and the works. Looks like a regular hospital room. I'm sorry about all the extra work, Miss Hampton, but Dad wouldn't stay in the hospital. He kept shouting he wanted to come home. Well, I don't blame him one bit. Poor old man just wanted his own house, that's all. Now, y'all go on and get some sleep. I'll watch out for everything. You'll call us if-- if anything happens? Of course. Now, you go on. Come on, Floyd. You've had it, baby. Well, maybe I'd better stay here? No, Floyd, there's nothing you can do. Come on. Get some sleep. Yeah, OK. Will you be all right, Miss Hampton? Sure. Sure. Well-- goodnight. Goodnight. [knocking] Howdy, Claudine. Well, howdy there, Mike. What are you doing, prowling around here at this time of night? Well, Olin Potts come by my place and told me how the Colonel took sick, and all that, so I just got over here as soon as I could, and I waited around outside here till the family left, and-- Well, come on in. My goodness. It's a wonder the skeeters didn't eat you alive. How is he? It ain't good, Mike. It ain't good at all. Poor old fella. He oughta be in the hospital. Don't matter where he is anymore. He's a fine man, the Colonel is. A real gentleman. [weak laughter] Thought you was a no good liar, Mike Tremaine. But you just there proved it. Well, now, listen there. How do you feel, Colonel Kincaid? Rotten. Where am I? Why, you're home now, Colonel. Right where you wanted to be. Now, ain't that nice? Who are you? Claudine Hampton, Colonel? Oh, yeah, yeah. You're Skip's mom, ain't ya? That's right, Colonel. Mustn't talk too much. You need your rest. The hell happened to me? I feel weak as a baby. Somebody didn't shoot me, did they? Of course nobody shot ya. You're just tired, that's all. Wore out. You need to get a little rest. I had the damnedest dream. I was back in the trenchers. Could see the Germans coming up through the wire, just real as soon as air. Now, Colonel, I think it's time you went on into your room. Give me a hand, will you, Mike? No, no, no. I'm all right. I want to stay here a while. Dammit, woman, you stay clear of me! You want me to fetch Floyd and Maureen? They've been awful worried about you. No. Leave them be. They're probably asleep, or something. Must be kinda late. What-- what time is it, anyway? - 2: 00, Colonel. - In the morning? Yes, sir. Now, Colonel, I really think-- Would you sit down, and stop fluttering around? Where's my Red Cross nurse? Flutter, flutter. They wore these big shoes, and they'd stomp. You could hear 'em coming a mile away. Stomp, stomp. Flutter, flutter. You should be trying to conserve your strength, Colonel. Hell with it. What do I gotta conserve my strength for? Can't go fishing, can't shovel no dominoes. Can't do a damn thing. Too damn old. Too damn old for anything. Colonel, maybe you oughta do what Miss Hampton says. Oh, by God I won't. I'm Colonel Jefferson C. Kincaid, officer in the AEF. Don't by god tell me what to do. I'm going to wake up his folks. Why do I-- why do I feel so weak? Oh, god. I ain't gonna die, am I? No. Hell no, Colonel. You ain't gonna die. Yes, I am. I know I am. I can feel it. God. It's scary, Mike. God, awful scary feeling. I'm going to shut off. Just-- shut off, and slip into nothing at all. Right in the ground, like an old tree, or something. Thin, waxy, and dripping like them bodies I seen in France. Used to stack them up like cordwood in the death wagons. Now it's my turn. God in Heaven. Now it's my turn. Now, Colonel, please don't talk like that. Can't help it, Mike. I'm afraid. Death wagon's coming, Mike. Coming for me. Bells of hell. Bells of hell. I can hear 'em ringing. Your folks are here now, Colonel. You just tell your daddy to stop all this foolishness, and let me get him on into bed. Now, Dad, you do what Miss Hampton says. Now, she knows best. Don't care if she does. Don't want people touching me, telling me what to do. Telling me not to talk. Nobody's gonna touch you, Colonel. You just stay right where you are. Everything's going to be all right. - I think I'm fixing to die. - Aw-- Colonel, you ain't, either. Things keep coming into my mind. Long ago things keep coming back, real as real. Trenches. Carter Tremaine. Franklin, Elizabeth, and Charlie Parsons. Always back at the ranch. Suzette Jenae. Suzette Jenae. Floyd? Yeah, Dad? You can have that land out there, Floyd. Naw, Dad. Let's don't talk about that anymore. That land's yours. No, you go and put some houses on it. Let folks get some use out of it again. Nothing out there for me nowadays. Things I've seen, and remember in this country is all gone now. Even the sounds of things. Creaking noise the saddles used to make, when we'd ride to work early in the morning. Men yelling, dogs barking, horses stomping around. I can see my daddy pulling up his rope, sitting atop that dumb mare, straight as a by god ramrod. I recollect old Charlie Parsons and me, running across Seven Spears on the way to the Jenae place. Being there with Suzette, out by the stocktake. Listening to the frogs, talking about how things are going to be after we was married. How good the lights looked at ranch headquarters when they come riding in after dark. Hearing the deer boom, boom through the brush. Sometimes when we'd round up and corral some of the stock, a few deer would get mixed up with the bunch. When you closed the corral gates, them damn deer jump right over the fence. Plumb over the fence. I-- I liked working at the ranch. Maybe I should have stayed there, instead of jumping the fence, and running all over the damn world. Philippines, and Mexico, and France. And if I hadn't of, I'd have never got to serve with old Blackjack. My god, that's really something, wasn't it? Never heard old Harry S. Truman cussing them mules there at the [inaudible] Forest. Never would have. Never. Mike? Mike? Yes, sir? Yes, sir? I'm the oldest living graduate of the Mirabeau B. Lamar Military Academy. Ain't that a hell of an note? Oldest living graduate. Bet you didn't know that, did you? Eh, no. [applause] [music playing] NARRATOR: Preston Jones film segments provided courtesy of public broadcasting station KERA.
