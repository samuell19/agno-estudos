Subtitles by explosiveskull Let's have the back now, Carter. Copy that. Gentlemen, good morning. I'm so sorry, but I'm afraid you've had a wasted trip. Mrs. Burgess passed away this morning. Oh. Understood. Oh, well. My sincere condolences, Mr. Burgess. But I'm afraid it's back to the nick with you. I'd like to see her, if it's all the same. What's the point? She's dead. I'd like to see my mother. Hold on, mate. Members only. - Yeah, I'm a member. - We're closed. Fuck off. Enjoy. Cheers, mate. You look like a man who could do some wishful drinking. What can I get for you, my love? Oh, I dunno. What you got on tap that's decent? It's a members' club, not the fucking Ritz, darling. - Just what you see. - All right, I'll have anything with a hefty head then, please. Yeah, I think I can do that. Been behind this bar since you were in short trousers. - Not seen you in here before. - I don't get out much. Oh, I bet you're the life and soul of the party, are ya? Do you know what? I do have my moments. Keep the change. Cheers. Everyone's spooked. Everyone. Even Hyde's moved his office upstairs. And Lincoln said he don't want no one out on the streets till this has been cleared up. We're on curfew 'cause Rook couldn't handle his shit against some nutter with a blade? It was a fuckin' axe. And no. We're on a curfew 'cause, one, Stokes is gone missing, and two, that nutter killed Rook. Well, we all feel bad for him, bro. But I've got a business to run. Rook would be the first to agree with me, because whilst he was a bit of sadistic cunt, he was first and foremost a professional. Did you hear what happened to him? You do you know about the hand, don't ya? - What hand? - For fuck's sake. Oi, Tune. Come and tell Vern here what happened to you and Rook. - Why? What do you wanna know? - Just tell him what happened! See, me and Rook, you know, we're standin' on the corner. And we're slingin' a bit of Scooby. You know, standard Tuesday night. And all of a sudden, we clock this geezer. You know, standing on the other side of the road. And he's eye-fuckin' us. Yeah. So Rook turns around, he says he's gonna go and have a quick word. Now, I can't do nothin' about it. I've got customers to deal with. Next thing, Rook is on his hands and knees, holdin' his arm. I realize he's had his fucking hand cut off by this nutter. Yeah? So obviously I goes fucking running over, ready to smash his face in, and this guy shits himself and runs. Obviously, I give chase, but this guy's fast, right? He's, I mean, crackhead fast. So I realize I've left Rook in the middle of the fuckin' street. But by the time I get back, he's fuckin' dead. There's blood everywhere. I couldn't find his fuckin' hand. Like, just gone. Vanished. Yeah, what's with the laugh, mate? Don't mind me, pal. Don't mind me. Who's this prick? You must be a tough guy then, yeah? Chasin' that bloke away all by yourself. It's funny, that. You don't look like a tough guy to me. Well, what's a fucking tough guy look like then?! Well, they look like me, don't they? You know, handsome, well-aged. Yo, Bez! Who the fuckin' hell's this? I dunno. He didn't say his name. Cliff let him in. I thought he was part of the firm. I'm an old friend of Lincoln's. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, that's right, mate. How'd you fuck up your face so bad? Playing with your dildo, was it? Yeah, borrowed it off your dad, mate. Well, he's got some fucking front, don't he? Not as much as you, judging by that fuckin' yarn you were just spinnin'. Cor, he's doin' you right out there, Tune. You weren't fuckin' there, right?! - Just shut up! - Oi! Simmer down, yeah? Don't make me call last orders early. And you, stop winding him up. Or you can get the fuck out! All right, all right. I'll apologize. Lads, lads, I'm sorry, all right? I'm just havin' a laugh with ya, yeah? A bit of a giggle. I'll finish my beer and be on my way. Yeah, right along... dickhead. - Enough. - What the fuck?! What do you know about Frankenstein's monster over there? I never seen the freak before in my life. And I think I'd fucking remember. Hasn't exactly got a face you can fucking forget, is it? - He seems to have you sussed. - What's your fucking problem? No, no, no, he's right. If Lincoln invited him, we best just keep things civil. - So, go on. - Go on what? - Finish the fucking story. - Yeah, right. 'Course. So, I'm... I'm obviously standin' there. This big, massive bag of merch. You know, Rook's lyin' in the street, dead. Next thing, I hear the sirens comin', the police are on the way. So I had to fuck off. - Do you know what I mean? - Bollocks! You were long gone way before they arrived. - What?! - Ran off shitting bricks, you did. - Do you want me cave your fucking face opened up again? - Oh, here we go! Finally found your ball, did ya, mate? Yeah? Don't you think it's about time you told your mates the truth? Tune, what's he goin' on about? Yeah, Tune, what am I goin' on about? I dunno. His head's fucked, Mo! I dunno, he's fuckin' twisted. Well, you wanna hear my twisted take on this tale? - Not really, chap. - Well, fucking humor me! At least whilst I finish my pint. 'Cause there was a bloke standing staring at you. That much is true. Yeah, Rook. Check out Bill. He's been eye-fuckin' us for the past ten minutes. Yo, bruv! Can we help you with somethin'? Mate, you deaf?! I'm fuckin' talkin' to you, mate. What do you want? - Sorry, mate, but... - Am I supposed to be scared? - Here, go ahead. - Huh? Makes a change, you fuckin' paying. It's good. Fuck off. Look, just fuck off, yeah? Ah! Fuckin' hell! Nah, that's bollocks. You know I'd never run from a fight. - Just this once then, eh, Tuney? - Oh, fuck off, you wanker! - So you killed Rook? - Yeah, that's right, mate. What the fuck are you gonna do about it? Well, clearly you're only interested in one thing. Oi. It's time for you to leave. I've still got half a pint left, love. Yeah, my pub, my pints. Get out! Come here, you fuckin' wanker! Get the fuck back! Oi, get over there! Move it! Anyone else make a move on me, I'll kill 'em! Swear to fucking Christ! Get away from that door! Where is he? - Where the fuck is he?! - Who?! - Lincoln! - How is this low-key, you stupid, noisy... Come here! Turn around! Get over there. You got anyone else up there?! You remind me of someone. - All right. - But you can't be him, 'cause he's on a long stretch, and he was a little melt. Fuck me. The prodigal brother returns. What rock did you crawl out from under? HMP Belmarsh, like you didn't know. - Who the fuck is this joker? - Well, ladies. This is Cain Burgess. Lincoln's little baby brother. Are you jokin'? What, this nutter?! Did a job for us few years ago. Cocked it up. - Went down for five years. - Seven years now. Is that where they redecorated your face? Fuck me. Looks like someone set fire to your head and put it out with a shovel. Still, not all bad, eh? Must have liked all that cock. All right! Looks like we're havin' a lock-in, Bez! So do me a favor. Rustle me up another one of your perfectly-poured pints. - Please. - That's better. Only takes a moment to be courteous. Ya little cunt. - Mind your language, Beryl. - Beryl? Do I look like I was born in the '20s, ya cheeky git? - It's Bez. - Yeah, all right. Bez then. Could be short for Beryl, couldn't it? I used to blush as a kid. Got called Strawberry, and then it got trimmed down to Berry. Ended up as Bez. - I don't blush now, darlin'. - Yeah, I bet you don't. - Ahh! - Get back! Get back! I fuckin' told you what would happen, didn't I? Oh, fuck! All right! You've done my leg! Mobile phones! One from each of ya. Throw them in there, or the person next to you gets fuckin' kneecapped. Do it! Come on! Can't fucking hear myself think! Shut up! Well, to be fair, you have just blown his foot off. It will sting a bit. That's nice. Nice and quiet. Hyde, this cunt reckons he killed Rook. Really? Well, Tune, you chased 'im off. - You recognize him? - No. He's full of shit, Hyde. - What do you say to that, Cain? - You think I'm full of shit, do you? - Yeah. - Yeah? You're full of shit, apparently. Your mate Rook had a chunky chess piece inked on his hand, yeah? - Open it. - Fuck that. - I said open it! - I'll do it. No! No. He needs to do it. Open it, you fuckin' pigmy! Go on. - Do it. - All right. That's it. Jesus fucking Christ! You're fucking mad, mate! - Oh, dear, Cain. - Well, I guess that clears up - the whole "How full of shit am I?" debate. - What have you done? So how about we have a nice little breather? Why don't you gents take a seat? Come on, sit down! Fucking sit down, mate. You eyeball me, I'll blow your fuckin' head off. Sit down. All right, Bez, drinks all 'round. You can put 'em on Hyde's tab. - He ain't got a tab, love. - Hm. I dunno whether you've been payin' attention or not. I've got a big fuckin' gun in my hand, and I'm not afraid to use it. Hate to piss on your chips, darlin', but this ain't the first time I've looked into that end of a shooter. Be reasonable, Bez. Do us all a round of drinks. Please. Yeah, Bez, will you get us one of them Rooster Rojos as well, please? You'll get what you're fucking given. All right? Yeah, 'course. Yeah. Now, I'll have a Rooster Rojo. So... ...prison turned you into a stone-cold killer, did it? Nah, prison didn't. You and my brother did. You wanna know what I think? Fuckin' sit down! Fuck off! I'm gonna take pleasure... crackin' your fuckin' skull open. But you know what? That can wait. And I got pretty good at waitin'. Get your phone out. You're gonna tell 'im to get down here, right now. You're gonna tell 'im it's about Rook, and then you're gonna hang up. Yeah, it's me. Need you to come down to the Jockey. We got a situation. It's about Rook. Good boy. Hyde. Please tell me it was you and all the lads - that gave that cunt all his scars. - Oh, I'm sorry, mate. But I wish it was. Oh, you wanna know how I got these scars, do ya? Oh, yeah. Enlighten us. You and my brother may as well have carved each one of these scars into my flesh. Where have you been hiding yourself these days, Cain? - We haven't seen you in ages. - I thought I better not show my face around for a bit, you know how I mean? Need to talk to my brother, though. Got a great business deal for 'im. You hear that? Perhaps you should give the lad a shot. He's on the up-and-up. Doesn't know the meaning of dishonesty. Couldn't even throw a fight. The up-and-up? The fuck-up, more like. All you had to do was lose a fight. - Lost me a packet. - Do you know what, Rook? I don't think I heard what you just called me. Do you, uh, do you wanna say that again, mate? - You heard. - Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. You lost a packet, you dumped five large. I dumped 15 large. What is it you wanted from me? Is it all right if I have a word with you outside? You mad? I'm in the middle of a card game. You got something' you wanna ask me, let's hear it. All right. I've got a business proposition for ya. It's, uh, it's a good deal. Been talkin' it through with Mum, - and she thinks it could be a real winner. - Mum? - Yeah. - Well, you know I love our mum. Means more to me than life itself. But since when has her business acumen got anything to do with what I fuckin' do? Well, you remember Sulley from the gym, right? Yeah, Old Sulley, he's jackin' it in. So I made him an offer, he's accepted. Right? It's a good deal, real good deal. Just need the start-up capital. Which is where you come in, of course, but I've got a business plan - written up and everything. - Should be a laugh. Let's hear it. Cain, I have a few very simple rules that I live my life by. And they've served me double well over the years. One of 'em is never, ever, ever lend money to family. It's a good plan now, right? I'm tellin' ya, I could go through it with you right now if you want. No. Because I'm gonna pass, mate. You see, little bruv, lending money is what I do. - I know. - I mean, what happens if you can't pay me back, and your business plan goes fucking backside? We don't wanna come after you and seriously hurt you. - Oh, come off it, mate. - Gyms come and go, mate. What makes yours so fuckin' special? Not your star-studded career. Please don't tell me that, because you fucked up. You fucked up. Every one of your fans in this room dumped proper money on you. - I know. - Because they trusted you. - Yeah. - And now you're coming to me, and you're askin' me to fund your next gamble. Why do you talk to me like that? Eh? Condescending. - You're my brother, not my fuckin' dad. - I know, but you're comin' to me and you're askin' for money. What do you expect? - Fuck this. - Cain, Cain, Cain. Come on, sit down. Sit down. You always fuckin' get excited. You and that temper. Look, I know what you're tryin' to do. You're keepin' your nut down and you're fuckin' keepin' your nose clean. That's a good thing. It's a really good thing, and I'm proud of ya. But I'm tellin' you now, if you want me to break one of my rules and lend you money... then you're gonna have to do something for me. I appreciate that, but I'm not lookin' to get into anything like that. I don't want to do anything illegal. This is the closest you're ever gonna get to me lendin' you money. So take it or leave it. - Well, what's the job? - Go and see Hyde. He'll fill you in everything you need to know. And trust me, it's a piece of piss. Not even you could fuck it up. Can we have a salesman on the floor, please? We have a customer interested in the Jaguar. I bet seven grand on you losin' that fight. I was tryin' to make it look real, wasn't I? So you knocked him out cold? In Mexico, you know what happens to people that behave like that? They string him up under a bridge, cut off their dick, and shove it down their mouths. - Come on, it's a bit harsh, isn't it? - Yeah, well, you know, they're savages. But that's not the point. It hurt, and I don't just mean the money. - We're friends. - Yeah, I know. Your brother tells me, "Oh, give him another shot." But... I'm not so sure. Look, I made a mistake. Right? It's not gonna happen again. Because my brother is gonna vouch for me. Rook says you're a fucking liability. Oh, well, if Rook says so, I'll just fuck off then. Oh, sit down, princess. Don't shit yourself. I didn't say we weren't gonna use you. I'm just lettin' you know your standing in terms of the establishment. - You seen one of these before? - Blue plastic bag? - Seen a few, yeah. - Oh, man of the world, are we? At 3:00 this afternoon, Mabel Liddell is gonna come into this office. She's gonna take this away with her. You are gonna follow her home to London Fields, where she lives. You're gonna take that bag off of her, and you're gonna bring it back here. - Simple. - What's in the bag? About, um... about two and half pounds of none of your fucking business. If she causes you any trouble, you can knock her out cold, can't you? - Yeah, right. - Yeah. All right then, laughing boy. Wipe the fucking smile off your face, have a dump, wind your watch, fuck off across the street, get outta my office, and close the door on your way out. Well, this is all very interesting, but is it goin' anywhere? Yeah, it is, actually. You see, because of you and my brother, I ended up goin' to prison. Didn't I? HMP Belmarsh, or as I came to know it, Horrible Motherfuckin' Piss-hole Belmarsh. The filthiest, most violent and godforsaken prison in England. Yeah, that was where that joke of a judge sent me. I didn't have a criminal record, I never had that mindset. You know, I couldn't even throw a fuckin' boxing match, but they threw me in there with those hardened murderers, rapists, serial offenders. There's a reason why they call that place the Meatgrinder. Say excuse me, cunt. Excuse me, cunt. Jaw seems to be healing nicely. Now, they would've given you the normal dentures if you just asked. - Yeah, I did. - You should've said please. Now, if it bothers you that much, when you get out of prison, just get 'em switched. It's an easy procedure. Do you know what? I don't mind 'em. Make me look scary as fuck. Hi, Mum. Take a seat. What happened, son? Your teeth! Yeah, I know. Got into a bit of a scuffle. - Why is it always you? - It's not always me, Mum. I'm in prison, aren't I? What do you expect? This is what I expected. I'd hoped you'd learn something in here. Get a bit of a kick up the backside. I'm gettin' a kick up the backside, all right. - Don't worry about that. - Nothing to be proud of. - I'm not proud of it. - I'm just... worried about you, son. I don't... I don't know what to say, to do. - I spoke to another lawyer. - Yeah? But I ain't got the money to pay 'em. Neither do you. What's Lincoln say about it? Well, Lincoln don't talk to me about that sort of thing. Lincoln does his own thing. Has he said anything about me? He said it's your own fault for gettin' in trouble. - Fuck's sake, Mum! - Don't talk to me in that language! I brung you up to be better than the animals in here. Don't stoop to their level. - No, I'm sorry, Mum. - Lincoln has his work. And whatever you say about him, he ain't in jail. He ain't the one keeping me awake at night, worryin'. Lincoln needs to come down here and talk me, all right? You gotta tell him to come here and talk to me. I'll tell him, son. No touching. I'm sorry, Mum. I didn't hear nothin' off Lincoln. Not a goddamn word. - I was on my own. - Ahh! So it was clear that I was gonna have to look after myself. Put it down! Put it down now! I didn't fucking do anything! They jumped me! I didn't fucking do anything! The Council finds it reasonable to believe that you were at least in part responsible for the incident that took place on the 28th of June, and it thereby finds you guilty as charged. I don't understand this, Your Honor, what do you want me to do? They're comin' at me with a knife, it's self-defense, clearly, right? What do you want me to do? Let 'em stab me? - Order. - No, I'm telling you, there's people in this prison, they're out to get me. I need a transfer, I need it today! Your sentence is hereby extended by one year. Please, take the time alone to reconsider your life decisions. I'll consider the fact that you're a fuckin' ponce! For what?! Fuckin' defending myself, that's for what! - You fuckin' stupid cunt! - Come on. You haven't got a fuckin' clue, have ya? You sit there in your fuckin'... fuckin' suit and tie, huh? You haven't got a fucking clue! Nothing could have prepared me for the shit that I was about to go through in this hellhole. So I had to make a choice. If I was gonna get through this stretch in one piece... Talkin' to me, mate. Yeah? Talkin' to me, yeah? Pa-pow! ...then I was gonna have to treat this like a fight. You fuckin' want it? Pa-pow! That's what I'm talkin' about, mate. Yeah? Come back here, get some more! I had to change myself into something I didn't even recognize anymore. I'll fuckin' take on both of you! Boom, boom, boom! Wah! Fucking come on! So as the months and the weeks rolled by, I slowly but surely turned myself into what you see before you now. A hardened, rusty nail. You see, the body can be strengthened to a degree, but it's your mind that makes you impervious to defeat. Just like the skin on your knuckles, the mind can be made callous as fuck. Bodily pain can do that. So I learned how to take pain. But, more importantly, I learned how to dish it out. Come on, lads! Come on! You see, the problem I had was why? Why did every fucker in that place want me dead? I mean, it didn't make any sense to me. I couldn't work it out. And then one day... it all became clear. Anyone else fucking want it? Anyone else?! Huh?! How are ya? Hey. That's it. In through the nose, out through the mouth. You're all right. Probably a bit concussed, mate. Don't worry, you know, the guards'll land in a minute. Nothin' personal, Cain, ya know? Nothing personal? Why'd ya do it then? Hey? What you got to gain from havin' a fuckin' skull fracture? Hope it was worth it, mate! It fuckin' woulda been. Twenty grand. What ya talkin' about, 20 grand? - Ah... - What are ya talkin' about? Twenty grand from where?! Twang was hookin' us up, yeah? I think your brother's bank-rollin' it. What the fuck you talkin' about? My brother? I ain't joking, yeah? I only did it for the cash. My brother did this?! You're saying my fuckin' brother did this? My own brother?! My own fuckin' brother?! Why'd he do it, Hyde? I'm sorry, sweetheart. I've no idea what you're talkin' about. Don't you deny that. Don't you fuckin' dare! You and my brother had a price tag put on my head, didn't ya? Didn't ya?! I can accept it from a dirty, conniving little bastard like you, but I cannot accept that from him. Week after week they came. One after another. Sometimes, more than one. Do you know what? It didn't matter to me. Keep 'em comin', I said. Bring on all comers. Come and have a fuckin' go, mate! The more that came, the stronger my mind got! And my daily existence became about survival. Fucking come at me?! Come at me, then! Come on! You fucking...! - Oi! - I bet you didn't know it's possible to make your own napalm in prison, did ya? Well, you can. And it fuckin' burns. Uh! We hereby find you guilty, and your sentence, Mr. Burgess, will be extended by two years. Five weeks segregation to commence post-haste. Fuck you. Ahh! Come on! All I have is a dead inmate, and you had his blood on your clothes. Well, I'm adding an additional year to your sentence for being a part of the altercation. Likewise, six months segregation. Fuck you! It's good to see ya, Mum. What's it been? About three years, is it? I did come to see you. They told me you was in solitary. - More than once. - Yeah. Anyway, your brother didn't... didn't think it was a good idea. Too much stress. And he's right. Look at ya. I don't know what you've become. Something you need to know about Lincoln, Mum. Probably not gonna be easy for you to hear, but... Well, there's somethin' I need to get off me chest first. It's not easy to say, but... I'll just say it. I've got the cancer. I've known for a few months, but I didn't want to bother anyone. I start chemo on Tuesday. They say it might be quite tough, so I don't think I'll be able to get in to see you much. - I'm sorry, Mum. - You don't have to be sorry. Your brother's looking after me. Every day. Bless him, I don't know what I'd do without him. We'll be okay. And what was it you wanted to tell me about Lincoln? Oh, don't worry about that, Mum. It's nothin'. - Oh, go on. - No, it's... - Aw, come on. - I'm glad Lincoln's lookin' after you. That's... that's a weight off me shoulders, you know? Yeah, yeah. We're all fighters in this family, aren't we? - Look at you. - Yeah, we're fighters. Right, time's up. Come on, let's go. Come on! Never really knew what your pancreas did till my mum's got riddled with cancer. I still don't, really. She was a fighter, my mum. She fought that cancer longer than anyone thought she could. So they let me out for just five hours to go see her. Sent me with a six-man security detail, one paddy wagon, two cars. She died before I even got there. I didn't know. I knew she was ill. Sorry for your loss, she was a fine woman. I did know that some lad had done for a couple of screws and made a break from the hospital, I just... didn't connect the dots. Maybe you shoulda done. So how the fuck do you manage that then? Sorry about your mum. I'm sure she was a lovely lady. But if you wanted to see her more often, you should keep yourself outta trouble. - Can't let you go. - It's all right, mate. You aren't gonna say anything, are ya? Yeah? Well done. I didn't think you had it in you. Well, I'm not the same bloke you left out in the cold, Hyde. I don't suppose you are. Right. That's it. I need a piss. - Go in your fuckin' trousers. - What?! - You heard. - That is inhumane. I've got eight pints on board! To be fair, none of us had planned on being held hostage today. I need a piss as well. Go in one of them bottles then. - Nah. I need a shit. - Piss in one of the bottles. - And you can shit your pants. - Uh, might wanna rethink that. Pretty sure none of us wanna be stuck in here breathing this one's guts. Look, whatever you're gonna do, figure it out and do it quick. Fucking zombie-looking bastard. - Oh! - Stop embarrassing yourself! Enough of you and your silly panto. If you're gonna do somethin', crack on! Because I am bored of your bullshit! Oh, you want me to crack on, do ya? Yeah? Tell you what then, turn around. Get on your knees. Go on. There you go. That's a good pig. When my brother gets here, we'll kick things off nicely. But until then, do me a favor and shut your fuckin' mouth. Or you'll be next. You know, I don't remember you being so drappy. Or so gangsta. Oh, I've come a long way since the blue bag day. When you sent me to steal from Mabel Liddell, I coulda never imagined where it woulda led me to. Don't know why you're fuckin' runnin', love! Well, I'll leave you the purse, all right? But I'm keepin' the bag! Oh! Mabel Liddell. Forty-nine, mother of three. Grandmother of two. Worked as a dinner lady at the local comprehensive. Died earlier this evening whilst undergoing surgery related to a traffic accident. - Wasn't my fault. - You stole her purse, mate. She chased you, and she ran into traffic. That's a manslaughter charge. That and the robbery, well, they'll put you away for this, Cain. But... we're not really interested in that, mate. Does the term "cuckoo" mean anything to you? Cuckoo? As in the fuckin' bird that can't build a nest, so it steals one from another fuckin' bird. Oh, right, yeah. That cuckoo. Means fuck all to me, mate. So your brother runs the largest entrapment and cuckoo scam in the city. The last three years, we've been working with people who your brother's persecuted. Mabel Liddell refused to cooperate. But we were observing her. Which means you're kinda fucked. Doesn't it, mate? - I want a lawyer. - You're incommunicado, boyo. You don't get a bloody lawyer. Usually starts with a single family member. Black sheep, idiot brother. You know, your type. Lincoln, Hyde, any of these other heavies that we know of, they'll end up paying the family a little visit one day. And they'll say, "Well, so-and-so owes us a little money. And he's in line for a little belting. But if you run us this little errand, we'll let him off." Family's too happy to oblige, aren't they? Give 'em a little package. Tell 'em that there's some drugs or some money in the package and tell 'em to go to such-and-such address. What they don't tell 'em is they hire another hoodlum to rob them on the way, mate. Right? All of a sudden, there's a catastrophic amount of money in that package. Now, this is the entrapment part. The gang members want more, don't they? So they show up at the fuckin' house. Yeah? They want the dole, they want the check, they want the cash. They take the fuckin' car. They move into the house. They run the operations from the house, and they use the car to run the errands. They stay on the property until all the assets have been destroyed. And then they just move onto the next. Your brother, he does this. Hyde does this. - And you fuckin' do it too. - The fuck I do! Got no idea what you're talkin' about, mate. "Albert Mitchell, Pete Singlehurst, James Webb, Eric Godley, Sandy Park, Miriam Silverman, and now Mabel Liddell." There's a 150 or so other families. Children have been orphaned because of your brother's fuckin' business. So you listen to me. And you listen to me very carefully. Manslaughter and robbery are the least of your fuckin' problems, mate. I'm throwin' organized crime at you. I want a fuckin' lawyer, all right? You listenin' to me? I want a lawyer! I don't know anything about this shit! - What about my rights?! - Your rights are to give up your brother, mate. Thems the only rights you fuckin' have. This operation implodes without your brother. Maybe then a hundred or so other people can move on with their lives. Come on, mate. Give me your brother. Let's just finish this right now. How about... bollocks? How about that? You're choosing the hard road, because you're goin' away for a very, very long time. Sarge! Come on in, Cain. Let's have a little you-and-me time. I don't know anything about this. Oh, I've got the devil in me, too, Cain. But I learned to accept my wickedness. I learnt to apply it for good. You see, I have always been good with my fists. O'Hara do this to everyone who doesn't just bend over and get fucked then, does he? Oh, he wouldn't approve of this. But then we don't have to tell him everything, now do we? I don't care if you are the plod. All right. If you touch me again, I'll fuckin' wreck you, tough! How do you do that with your hands cuffed behind your back? Filthy boy. Look what you've done. You've gone and messed up my nice interrogation room floor. Do you know what we do to cats that piss on the carpet? We rub their dirty, fuckin' noses in it! Not so damned lippy now, are you, boy? I'm gonna hurt you, Cain. Open up! Open these fuckin' doors. Why are they bolted?! About fuckin' time. Bez! Unbolt them doors. Don't do anything stupid. Come on. What's happening? Why are these fuckin' doors shut? All right, lads. Come on in. Don't be shy! Make yourselves at home. Bez, shut those fuckin' doors now! You're not going anywhere! Do it! I can't believe this. So good to see you, brother. The only thing that matters is you're out. And you've come to me for help. I'm your brother. What's family for, after all. Get back! Get back! You think I'm gonna fall for that, do ya? Weapons, mobile phones. Put 'em on the bar! That means all of you! Come on! On the fuckin' bar! Drop your trousers, lift up your shirts. Fuck off, you ain't serious. We're not in prison. - I'm not one of your boyfriends. - Fuckin' do it. Do it! - You happy now? - Not just yet. Go over there with the others. Bez, do me a favor. Do us another pint with a nice, hefty head, would ya? Please! Why don't you just take that gun off of Hyde's head and put it back on me? Shut up! You're not the one in charge 'round here anymore. I am. Might have these monkeys eatin' out of the palm of your hand, but I know the real you, don't I? The cry baby that I pissed on from the top of the tree. Do you remember that? Well, I'm back up that tree again, bitch. Yeah, I remember that. I fuckin' remember it vividly. And I remember how I fuckin' beat the life out of you for doin' it. That was then. This is now. Seven years since I've had a pint. I'm playin' catch-up. Is he all right? He's unconscious. He was in a lot of pain. He's probably better like that. - He's dead. - You fuck! Fuckin' hell, this is bad. This is so fuckin' bad! Dumb cunt killed Rook too, boss. - He done what? - Yeah. He tried to kill me and all. Then he comes in here and throws Rook's hand on the fuckin' table! Cain, you're not thinkin' straight. You are not fuckin' thinkin' straight. D'you realize what you're doin'? Yeah, I realize what I'm doin'. And let me tell you why. For the last seven years, I've been livin' with the threat of violence hangin' over my head 24-fuckin'-7, never knowing where it's comin' from, who it's gonna be. I've been stabbed half a dozen times. I've had me bones broken, me ligaments torn. I've killed people, Lincoln. With my bare fuckin' hands. Prison's rehabilitated you well, son. Yeah?! Have you seen this scar? What about that, have you seen that? Do you know what that is, mate? Do you know what they call that? It's what they call a "napalm scar," that. What about these fuckin' teeth? Do you know what? I wanted them to give me some of them nice, white porcelain ones. But the prison dentist gave me these fucked up amalgam ones because of my attitude! Yeah but, you see, you do have a problem with your attitude. Oh, fuck! Stop doing that! Look at you. You're a loose cannon. Prison's turned you into a fuckin' psychopathic killer. Prison didn't! You fuckin' did! When you put a 20,000-pound price tag on my head in a prison full of rapists and killers, who'd fuckin' strangle you for a pack of cigarettes! - You did! - What do you fuckin' expect, when you start fucking grassin'? That we're just gonna fuckin' lay down and let you fuckin' bury us? I never said shit to anyone. I didn't say a fuckin' word! You're forgettin' we had a fuckin' cozzer on the inside keepin' fuckin' tabs on ya. Do you know what, you dumb fuck? Evans played you for a fuckin' fool! Told you a buncha lies, because he knew that you were gullible enough to fall for it! Your trusted a bent copper over your own flesh and blood! I never said a fuckin' word. Not a syllable! You're fuckin' standin' there, and you expect me to believe that Evans made all this up? Yes, he made it all up! O'Hara told me the truth! Do you know, when he found out about Evans, he had him thrown off the force! Why don't we just give fuckin' Evans a bell, get him down here, eh? Let's fuckin' get him down here, and let's just see what he has to say about all this. Gimme my phone. I don't think he's gonna be answering that phone, mate. - You all done, boyo? - Yeah, just finishing the sound check. - Do I know you, boyo? - We've met. You was a sergeant back then. What happened? You lose your job? Cain? Fuck me. Is that you, Cain? It's been a while. Johnny. Give us a minute, will you, boyo? Yeah, all right. So then, Cain. What? I'm guessing you, uh, broke outta prison? You tracked me down to this location, to act your revenge on the copper who booked you? You didn't book me. You set me up. Told my brother I was gonna snitch on him, didn't ya? "Hero Ex-Copper Kills Escaped Convict in Self-Defense." I'm really gonna enjoy this. Yeah, I did tell your brother you snitched on him, you fuckin' cocksucker. I'm gonna make you fuckin' pay, boy. Well, it looks like we got a little bit of a predicament, haven't we? Seems you been runnin' around all fuckin' weekend on your own little revenge mission. You're not thinkin' straight, Cain. Because I know I'm havin' difficulty takin' in everything that's happened this week. Been a tough week for you, has it, yeah? - Poor you. - I'm talkin' about Mum. - Did you get to see her? - Yeah, I saw her. Lyin' under a white sheet. You know, if I got there 20 minutes earlier, mighta been able to look her in the eye, hold her hand, tell her I loved her. You know what them cops did? Stopped off on the way for a vanilla latte. And where the fuck were you? Listen to me, I had stuff, I had shit that I needed to deal with. Oh, you had shit to deal with, did ya? More important than our dyin' mother? Don't fucking guilt-trip me on that one, please! - Abandoned her, didn't ya? - The fuck I did. Who do you think paid for all the doctors, huh? Who do you think organized every day for her to be picked up and taken to fuckin' hospital? Have you got any idea how much it broke her heart to come and see you in fuckin' prison? Because of you! I was inside because of you! You was the one who went and got fuckin' nicked. You knew the risks. No one made you do it. You let me in, and you threw me under the bus. No. No, no, no, no. It was Mrs. Liddell who got dragged under the fuckin' bus. By you. Listen to me. I know that life hasn't been great for you. And I know that I've not helped over the years. But you can put a stop to all this. You can fuckin' stop it right now. There's no one left, mate. Mum's gone. You can make a fresh start. You're a free man now. What about the others? What others? Albert Mitchell, Pete Singlehurst, James Webb, Eric Godley, Miriam Silverman, Mabel Liddell, and all the other lives you've been ruinin' for years. This retard's gone and remembered all the names. Look, I'll be honest with you, mate. To me they were just another fuckin' day at the office. They mean nothin' to me. They were cunts. It's a list of losers tryin' to shirk off their debts. Debts run up by smackheads and pill-heads and all sorts of other scum. We worked out a way of making quite a lot of money outta people that wouldn't be in that position if they'd kept their fuckin' head on straight. So you can take your sentimental bullshit, and you can shove it up your fucking... You fuckin' want it too?! Do you know something? I woulda given you the fuckin' benefit of the doubt on Rook and Chas. But what you just done, you cunt, what you just fuckin' done... I'm seriously gonna fuck you up like you can't believe. You've really fucked the duck now, this time. There's no coming back from that! Maybe I don't wanna come back. - You recognize this? - Should I? Your accountant's gonna miss it. Can I help you, mate? You got a nice place here, Stokes. - Done well for yourself. - Do I know you? Oh, come on. You don't remember an old friend? Fuck me. Cain. What happened to ya? Oh, shit me, that toast smells nice. Do you mind if I whack a 'round in? Eh? You have at least another decade on your ticket, so I'm guessin' you're not out on good behavior. Well, you got a good thing goin' on here, haven't ya, mate? You know, the wife, the kids, little pet bunny. Are they aware of what you do? How you ruin people's lives for my brother? I didn't take you for the violent type, Stokes. Sit down. - What do you want? - I wanna see them books. I can't let you, Cain. Take it you're aware my brother tried to have me killed on the inside? Cain, you know I've never been a part of that. I believe ya. I wanna take Lincoln down, Stokes. So you may as well just show me them books. And then you go and get your family, you get your shit together, and you get the fuck gone. If I just leave town, you promise you'll leave us alone? Give you my word. How much has he got in his accounts then? Three hundred thousand in his checking, with several offshore deposits, totaling out to about two million pounds - across a few currencies. - Tell you what. Leave him a grand and a half. Gonna move the rest. Where? Ah, well, uh, that's the fun part. Stokes was a crooked fucker. Couldn't lie straight in bed. But it didn't take him long to make his mind up - and save his own ass. - That's bollocks. - You're fuckin' lyin'. - You reckon? I took a picture of your account. See that? Two-point-two million in dollars, euros, pounds. All of it gone. I left you with a grand and a half. 'Cause that's what a few porcelain teeth woulda cost. You're never gonna see the rest. You sure are rackin' up the reasons to get yourself killed tonight, aren't you, my love? I hope your little revenge mission was worth it. You hear that, did ya, Lincoln? Key words there, revenge. Everything I've done over the last two days, it started with you. And for what you did to those innocent families, it's gonna end with you. When you die, the ledger'll be erased, the debts dissolved. And each and every one of those 147 families are gonna be free. Those names... you see, I couldn't help but memorize 'em. Repeated, time and time again in court, over and over I heard those names. See, I knew it was too late to help myself, but maybe... maybe I could help them. And maybe, one day, I might get the chance to be face-to-face with my brother. One last time. And when I found that purpose, well, only then could I bear all the pain and suffering. Because now it all had meaning. Now, it all made sense. Look... I know it's your brother that's out to get you. So, I ask you, why are you protecting him? Roll over on him, Cain. What are you waitin' for? They're gonna kill you in here. You know that, right? Good luck, son. I'll do it. I'll do it on one condition. My mum's in hospital. She don't have long left. I want to see my mum. You let me see her, I'll tell you what you wanna know. Christ, this ale tastes like shit, Bez. That's because I poured the drip tray into yours, darling. It's about time we got on with it then. Isn't it, eh? Guess you got a pretty good idea where this is going, Lincoln? - Yeah, I got a pretty good idea. - Yeah, good. They can all leave if they want. It's only really you that isn't going anywhere. What do you say, lads? You wanna get out of here? Enough of this fuckin' bullshit! We ain't fuckin' goin' anywhere! I dunno, um... I'd quite like to leave, actually. - If it's all right with you lot. - Shut the fuck up, Tune. Yeah, cool. Sorry, Lincoln. No one's going anywhere. You're gonna die in here tonight, Cain. You got two barrels. There's ten of us. I only need one to blow your fuckin' head apart. Yeah, well, maybe. And once you use that shot, my men are gonna take turns each tearing you limb from fucking limb. And what have you actually accomplished here tonight? Look at ya. I'll tell ya, shall I? Fuck all. Absolutely fuck all. You're a mess. And the only thing you're ever gonna be remembered for is being a fuckin' mess. I'm all right not being remembered for anything. So let's get on with it, shall we? You know, there's a million nerves in the human body. And you, as my brother, my fucking brother, you have always, since the day you were fucking born, got on every, single fucking one of 'em. Oi! Come on then! You fucking want some of me?! Come on! You cunts fuckin' want me? Come on! Kill him! Fuck! Fuck me! Come on then! This is fuckin' brunch at Belmarsh, this! Come on! Oi! Drop it! Fuck me. Fuck! Fuck. Cheers, guys. Mm. That's fuckin' good. Oh! Fuck's sake. I've only got a few of them left. Lemme ask you something. Was it worth it? I mean, all this for the sake of 150 pathetic, fuckin' losers? Is this what you wanted? Not all I wanted, no. You're done. It's over for you. I've cost you everything. All this, everything you've worked for, is finished. You're fucked, mate. Is that right? That's right, yeah. Yeah. Well, let me tell you something. Whatever satisfaction you think you're gonna get out of all of this is gonna be very fuckin' short-lived. Because I always come through. You know that, bruv. Answer me one thing first. Why'd you do it, Lincoln? 'Cause of you. Because of you. See, whether you fucking grassed or not, people stopped respecting me. And you know me, bruv. I will not be fucking disrespected. So, between me and you, what's done is done. You see, that's what happens when you get other people to do your dirty work. You forget to check the gun to see if it's loaded. Two shots, two barrels, and I've already used both of 'em, you dumb fuck! Fucking kill him! I think I'll call it a night then, Bez. Sorry about the mess. Bring out the crookedest bank accounts. Ah, maybe 147 crooked bank accounts. Divide my brother's fortune by 147. And transfer the money to their accounts. You're givin' it away. Are you mad? No, I'm not mad, mate. I'm thinking clearer than I have done in years. It's not much. Only about 15 grand each. But that's a lot of money to some people. Just here for my gyro, Mr. Patel. - Yeah? - Enough for a fresh start, anyway. Or maybe... maybe just enough to breathe again. Just heard from Albert Mitchell's nephew. Another cuckoo got a windfall. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That'd be the 12th one today, actually. Right there, Victor, please. That is great. Yeah, no, no, thank you, right. You're lucky this didn't go to the Crown Court. But as no one apparently saw anything, and the cameras were obscured, all I have is a dead inmate, and you had his blood on your clothes. I was tryin' to give him first aid. He had a shank so far into the back of his head, it was sticking out of his mouth. What exactly were you trying to do for him? Well, I'm adding an additional year to your sentence for being a part of the altercation. That is the maximum punishment that I'm authorized to set. Likewise, six months segregation. And cut.
