What are you doing? Nice. Oh! Did you see it? Now, you have to make a wish. Then I wish that everything was the way it used to be. Really? Oh, honey. -And I hoops. -And I hoops. I just love your new bracelet. Hi. Where is the main office for the direct? Direct? That's how we say it. -Who says it like that? -I do. -And who would you be? -I'd be Ida. I thought you were... Pippi Pocahontas. Lena, you're annoying. -You're annoying, you loser. -What a jerk. We're the coolest in the school Everybody's trying to hang But no one is getting in the gang We're the coolest in the school Everybody's just a fan But no one is getting in the gang We're the coolest in the school Everybody's trying to hang -Hi, I'm Ida. -Jo. -Yo. -Jo. -Yo? -Just Jo. Jo! Exactly Jo. So who are you, really? I get it. Could you point me towards the direct's office? -I mean, the director's office? -It's so simple. You just need to go up the stairs, then you go down again, then left, then left again. But that's the wrong direction. And you have to go first right and then straight ahead. -Honestly, what's the way? -I could write it on paper. How about you dance it? Three, two, one... -Here's our clumsy Claus. -Here's our clumsy Claus. Aw! Ugh! Benjamin, please tell me what the poor trash bin did to you? Hmm? Nothing, Mr. Director. Then you do understand that there's no way for them -to get out of your way. -Of course not, Sir Director. Wonderful. It's a mutual teacher-student agreement. And if you wouldn't mind, clean it up right now. He didn't do it on purpose. I'm sure. Ah, you must be the new girl. Don't say it. Ilene. Irene? Ivy. Ivy. -Ida. -Ida. If you're sassy, it doesn't make a good first impression. To be mean doesn't either. Wondraschek! What? The clock? -It's fast. -Yeah, fix it right now. Ivy. And you too, Wondraschek. Okay now, you can wait right here. We place enormous value on autonomy and independence. With this in mind, please read these carefully: school rules, house rules, and playground rules. -Understand, understood? -Mm-hmm. -Wondraschek? -Yeah? The turnip, the temperature? 90.3 degrees. Wondraschek! Do you want to be late on the very first day of school? Your first class. Get going right now! It's for your own might good. Hurry up! -Wondraschek! Puddle. -Yeah. I'm so tired. I'm about to beat you. Sixty-four seconds and 32 tenths! Sixty-four seconds and 32 tenths! That's not fair! Four tenths. This spot is taken. This one is too. Over here. Over here. -I can't believe she's... -I can't believe he did that. But just so that you know, that was a gigantic snake. Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Please quiet down. Quiet down, please, children. I hope you all had a lovely vacation. So, children, if I could have your attention, this is your new teacher, Ms. Cornfield. Why do we have a new teacher? What happened to Mr. Finke? Mr. Finke has been transferred to another school in order to be closer to a sick family member. Oh, really? Well, if you want to call winning the lottery "a sick family member", which I'm sure some people like to do, but Mr. Finke is currently in the South Pacific and doing just pity. -Good question. Thank you for asking, Max. -Huh? Is she serious? -He's well, you say? -Yeah. -Really? -Yeah. How does she know your name? So, what was I saying to you all? I'll add this to your collection. And I think I'll probably need to have another talk with your father, Jo. This is for your own mighty good. If I should need you, I know where to go find you, Director Siegmann. Yeah, then. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. [speaks Turkish] [speaks Turkish] [speaks Turkish] Where did you learn Turkish, Ms. Cornfield? Turkish is quite enchanting to speak, yes. But not a top secret language. We'll talk about top languages later. Now, as you have just heard, my name is Ms. Cornfield. In German: Frau Maisfeld . And I'm from Scotland, a wonderful country full of ancient riddles and extremely bad weather. What do any of you know about Scotland? Bagpipes. Bagpipes. Thanks, Jo. What? The Scottish have invented steam engines, bicycles, the television, penicillin, and telephones. And what do we know about Scotland? Bagpipes. But I want to talk to you about the essential things in life. Which one of you had the opportunity to stargaze last night? So sad. We should always take the time to look up at the stars. A starry sky can make our most secret wishes come true. Or not. Ida? -What? -Why does she know-- What were you able to observe last night between the hours of 10:12 and 10:13 in the sky? -A supernova. -A supernova. A twinkling wish in the inky dark night. And who knows, maybe two of you had the same wish. I have seen the supernova as well. I have made a wish that my new class would be one of a kind. And something really special. And if it so, then we will learn far more than these silly subjects like mathematics or English. Instead, the breathtaking and magical things in life. Like adventure... and friendship. What? Friendship? -Friendship? -She's weird. Wow! Woah! Wow! I have many more surprises up my sleeves in store for you all. I promise. Two of you will pretty soon have a very special friend. A magical animal! A friend for life. What is she saying? -I don't know. -Ms. Cornfield, what kind of animal? Wait, Ms. Cornfield-- Ms. Cornfield, what are you talking about? -Where are you going? -Ms. Cornfield... Ms. Cornfield. A magical community. -But are you sure about them? -Yes. I really believe in these kids. Which two children will be the first to get magical animals? -Hello, Mommy. -Hey, Ida! -Hello, Mrs. Schmidt. -Hello! Hello. Hey, how was your first day at school? The teacher is actually kind of nice. But I think she may have gotten lost on her way to Hogwarts. Hmm? The students are sort of nasty. And the direct... I mean, the director is the nastiest of them all. It's like they're all completely crazy! -Hmm. -Not all. Yes all. Yeah, they're all bam, bam. -Bam, bam? -Bam, bam. Yeah, bam, bam. I was so excited that you'd quickly find new friends. Oh, well. Oh. -Oh, but then there's Jo. -Yo. -Yo! -Shh! He's actually really nice. He's got cool friends and bouncy balls. Yeah. But I'm not allowed to play along. Anyhow, not yet. Come with me. I have a gift for you. Close your eyes. Close! So... these are good luck charms. And you'll see in the morning, things will definitely look a lot different. Different. Aww. Oh, here comes the mail! The mail is here! So now fly, my lovely little post! Oh, you giant glitzy, glossy shiny. Come, come, come to Mama! Yeah, yeah. I'm coming. Morning. Ida Kronenberg, selected. Whoa! You will get adventure. Magical animals on the way? Your new best friend is on the way. Benni? A mail for you. Snake cucumber is on sale this week. Only 99 cents half a pound. -Hurry up, okay? -Mm-hmm. Huh? The Magical Zoo Store announces... ...that the nominations have started. You are one of the first two children to get... ...a magical animal. Get yourself ready. Many greetings, The Magical Zoo Store." The Magical Zoo Store. Wow! -Cool! -Are you okay, Ida? Yep, Mommy! Goodbye, sweetie! Hello. Hormones! -Pre-puberty. -Early puberty! Or is it likely? -Pre-puberty. -Pre-puberty. No doubt. -Pre... -Puberty. Good morning, Mrs. Schmidt. Good morning, Mrs. Schmidt. Good morning. Good morning. -Good morning. -Hi. Wondraschek! Wondraschek! What? -The clock! -Did it stop working? -No, it's disappeared. Huh? Huh? -Uh. -Go find it. Exactly, look for it. Hurry up! Wait. -Wait up. -Ida! Ida, something totally cool happened to me! -Me too! -No, I mean really crazy! -I was-- -Oh no, that's so crazy? ...There are rumors of a school thief going around. Rumors that I unfortunately have to confirm. Our beloved school clock-- -School clock? -What's going on? -Wondraschek? -What? -The speaker has a loose connection! -Wait a minute. Now, Dr. Siegmann. Sadly, our school clock was stolen. We will find the person who ab-- - Wondraschek! -What? We will find the Wondraschek. What's that supposed to mean? I guess that means the janitor is hunting for the thief. -So what? -Like one of us? Who knows? Kinda weird. The school clock vanishes on the exact same day that new girl Pippi Pocahontas arrived here. Kinda weird that someone like you never repeated the first grade. Alright, now listen to me. There were magazines all over and I was on them. I was dancing. It was really weird and there were green bright letters. -Green bright letters? -Yeah. I also got a postcard also with green bright letters. Presentation! So, you'll have to work together in groups of two. -Oh, yeah! -Oh, yeah! Yeah! You choose the subject. One boy and one girl should make up a good group. -Oh, man! -Why? -Ida? -Benny, uh-- -Yeah. -About before-- About the presentation. I thought that you and I, maybe? -Yeah, sure, we can work on it. -Cool! -But really, let me tell you about-- -We can do it on meteorites. Or even better. Pirates? -Pirates? -Yeah. Well, why not? But I need to tell you something. There was this-- Quiet, please. I would like to introduce you to someone. -Who's that? -Oh, my gosh. Look at his hair. Sincerely, Morrison. Mortimer Morrison. My brother will be bringing us the magical animals. Magical animals? Okay. Now, I'm an animal lover and a proud owner of the Magical Zoo Store. -Wow, like in the note. -Wow, like in the note. I believe that all animals are magical, but some of them are just a little more... magical. Is it like with rabbits that get pulled out of a magician's hat? In that case, it's the magician who's magical, I teach ya. Or he acts like it. And not the rabbit. Wait a sec, he's just acting? Oh. -Oh. -What? Wow, that's so incredible! Magical animals are very special indeed. They figured you out. They are truly your friends... for life. A magpie is a great pet for Ida's super thief. Thieves? Us? We hardly ever steal. -What? -And once in a while at the most. And then only fancy, glossy, shiny, shiny, glitzy treasures. -So, they weren't teasing us. -A magical animal! You betcha! Magical, magical, abracadabra! Wow! Can you imagine? Discord, strife, and quarreling must now give way to unity. Because only to a magical community will I entrust -my animals. -Wow! You must swear to never speak about the animals. The secret belongs to your magical community. Wow. Wow. Wow. Stand up and repeat after me. -Never, never speak shall we? -Never, never speak shall we? -Never, never speak shall we? -Never, never speak shall we? -With others about our magical animals. -With others about our magical animals. -The Magical Zoo Store's top secret. -The Magical Zoo Store's top secret. -And so... -And so... -...it shall be forever and ever more. -...it shall be forever and ever more. Wow. Wow. Aww. So cute! Wow. A shark? No, a dino. No, it's a Caribbean tortoise. Not so bad, not bad at all. Dinos are my grandparents. And if anybody messes with my boy, then I'll give them a bite to remember. Just like my grandpa tyrannosaurus rex. Does that mean that you're my animal? Yeah, I'm Henrietta. Wow. Okay, back to you, boss. Aww, so sweet. Oh finally you're here! At last, I have a human friend! -Hey Ginger, I'm Rabbat. -Same to you, Ginger. Nice comeback. I am delighted. I believe this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship-- Did I just hear a dog howling? -No. -No, I was the one! Creative exercise. It's modern pedagogy. Rawr! Awooo! -Awooo! -Awooo! So, everyone, back to your seats. Back to your seats. And what do we have here? Ms. Cornfield, Ms. Cornfield, what's wrong with him? Sit down. Mr. Siegmann, how can I help you? I'm going from class to class with the objective to find the school thief. Very good. You need to watch out, Ida, super thief. Huh? Rabat? Good... good, good. Wow. I taught them that special magic trick. They know how to transform into stuffed animals. We call it fossilized. You're saying only we can really see them? Only you can really see what they really are, and even talk to them. Only the children that are in our magical community. So, any questions? -Yeah! -I do! When am I going to get my animal? Wish I had myself a monkey Then I'd get the party jumping And a penguin for me Think of just how cool we'd be If I had a huge giraffe I'd be tallest in the class It would be cool to have a hen Frying eggs straight out the pen A jellyfish would be so awesome Hey, but wait, those live in water Big brown bear, how cool that'd be - Or a T-Rex - Derek sings Yo, an ostrich would be cool - Hey, I want one too - Me too I want a pony white as snow You're not a princess, silly toad Hey, what's going on with you, slow poke? I bet you think that you're a sly fox, right? We want a pet Yeah, you bet We want it here And we want it right now We want a pet Yeah, you bet Or else we're gonna tear This place down Ooh Let's go dance with the white Super! Yo! Last one with the tree is a slow, slow poke! Whew! You're fast. Me too. -And cheeky. -You too. But I'm faster than you, and cheekier. And a super, duper climbing fox. Last one on top is a slow poke. Hey, you used the ladder. That's called cheating. You think you're as sly as a fox, huh? -Definitely. -Very good. I want to learn everything about human beings. -Like what? -Everything. Everything so new and different than where I come from. I understand. You're also new here, aren't you? I get it. -Hey, Ginger. -Yeah? Why are the trees over there by the bench so straight? They're not trees. They're lamp posts, silly -But I don't see any light. -Yeah, but later. People are very strange animals. You smell that? -Mmm, it smells so good! -No. -Yeah! It's the-- -Hey, look out! Come on, let's go! Stop! That thing is probably full of yummy city treats. I just can't pass up on trying all this goodies. Yippie! Oh, yummy! Oh, yummy! This is what you call a land of plenty! -What are you doing? Get out of there! -Whoa! -Hey, Ida, where are all the other kids? -They're at the playground. -They think I'm the super thief. -What is a super thief? Someone who steals things from the school. -And why do they do that? -I have no clue. Wait a sec. Wait a sec. -Wait a minute. -Oh, no, not again. -Just one minute. -Come out! Ah, here it is. I found something. -What is that? -It's a gross old chocolate chip cookie! Hey, no! Mmm. Yummy! -But you know what? -What? We'll prove that you're innocent. -But how? -We'll find the real thief. -No one is as sly as we are. -Yeah, we'll make it happen. -Hey, but you have to clean up first. -Hmm? First clean up. People sure are crazy animals. Ninja land turtles. They fight gangsters, and eat pizza. Not bad. Not bad at all. -Here they are. -We were looking for you. Hey, you guys. Hey, what's up? Hey, Henrietta, do you know where our bat is? -Where do you come from originally? -And how long have you been here? -What else can you do? -Okay. Well, one thing I can do is break dance. Whoa. Check me out I'm going to do the wave Like the whales down in the sea Got to put you in a daze Spinning at these whirlwind speeds Got more sway than a drunken pirate Now I'm moving to the beast Watch this, Benni First a handstand And then freeze Benni? Benni! Hey, where are you going? Benni! Wait up! Benni! Come, Ida! Hurry up! We'll show everyone that we're the best master detective duo in the world. Huh? Come, let's go. What was that? It's coming from back there. And can you smell anything, detective? It smells like... Hmm. The super thief! Quick, we'll catch him red-handed Hey, wait a sec! The trail is still fresh and smells like chocolate. -Delicious! -Uh-huh. The super thief was just right here. He kicked the snack machine, and then he stole all of the candy bars. Bang on it, see what happens. You think that's smart? Just about every master detective knows. If you want to catch a thief, you have to think just like a thief. Act just like a thief. And eat just like a thief. That's it, Ida! You almost got it! You're fantastic! That's an important clue! An important chocolatey-chocolate clue. -Hey, no pinching -My thoughts exactly. If it isn't our very own Ivy Kronenberg. Not Ivy, Ida. Don't interrupt me, you've been caught red-handed. Burglary and damage to the school. This just isn't funny anymore. -Wondraschek? -What? -Pat her down. -You're not allowed to do that. What are you holding on to? A chocolate smuggling device? Aha! A chocolate smuggling device. It's just my stuffed animal. -Okay, then let's have a peek inside. -No! Wondraschek! Wondraschek! You have a really great nose for chocolate smuggling devices. Thank you, Dr. Siegmann. -No, don't! -Hey! If you're looking for the school thief, by the bathroom, there's a boy he looks suspicious with chocolate bars. He ran by me. Wondraschek? Thank you, Jo. Yeah, sure. Hello? Anybody at home? Are you okay? No, because you just left me before. It's because no one really likes me there. But to see that my animal prefers to break dance -and sing for the super cool kids-- -Then say something! Don't just disappear! A hermit tortoise, that's okay. But hermit boys, that's just bad. You're so right. And next time, let's sit and talk about it. Like real friends do. -Friends? -Yeah. -You're the best. -No, Benni, you are the best. Just you and me We're gonna make some noise tonight Are you prepared To have a crazy pillow fight? And there! Come, let's build out All our favorite songs and not do it And then we'll chill With all the monsters underneath the bed When you're around I feel like I can do anything And you're the friend I've always wanted in my dreams -Hey, wait! -Again. And I'm finally here I have to wait so long for you And I'm glad you're there 'Cause you're the proof That dreams come true Hey! Put your balls into my hands They're thick and thin, they're cold hands When you find me here I have to wait so long for you Come on, tell me, what have you done in here? -Um, pillow fight. -Wait, what? What, by yourself, alone? Yeah, why not? Ida? Who tore the pillow? Um, that was me. Aaaaaaah! Stop it! Stop it! You look so much happier now. -Did my lucky earrings help you? -A lot. Then I'm happy. And your new stuff fox also likes a good pillow fight, huh? Yeah. Ida, I want this all cleaned up by tomorrow. Mm-hmm. -You promise? -Mm-hmm. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. Sleep tight. Narrow escape. Aw, aw ow! Awooo! Just practicing for choir, Mom. Hmm. Hmm. Really, Rabbat? What was all the howling about, huh? I started copying the wolves in the forest when I was lonely. It's the kind of, how do you do as part of the pack? Hmm, and? -What will we do tomorrow? -Tomorrow, we'll find the thief. Yeah, tomorrow we'll find the thief. And I'll become friends with Jo. You know what? I've always wanted a human friend. Just like you. Sweet dreams My cuddly furry friend My human best friend. Sweet as chocolate milk And gingerbread Look, the lights are on. Your fur is a cushion So silken and soft The moonlight shines You begin to drift off Sweet dreams My cuddly furry friend -Hmm? -Mmm. Hmm. Oh. Wondraschek! Wondraschek! My turnips! My little babies! Wondraschek! Rule number one; an expert master detective has eyes and ears everywhere. Try a little harder and then maybe your grades will get better. -Yeah? -No problem. Why can't you speak to him like a normal person and say goodbye? Rule number two; the detective looks beneath the surface and sees things that others might not see. Because everyone has a secret. And where there's a secret, there is a riddle. And for every riddle, there is an answer. If we want to find the super thief, we'll have to stay incognito. Concealed, invisible. -Hey, Ida, are you even listening to me? -Yeah. Hey, Ida! Stay undercover! -Hey, Jo! -Hey! -Thanks again for your help yesterday. -Sure. What were you guys doing yesterday at the candy machine? -Rabbat and I want to catch the thief. -Really? Combined efforts, Ida definitely has a plan. Wanna work with us? -Yeah, sure. -That's it. You distract him while I find the thief. Cool. Excellent, Ida. If we continue to be a good team, then we'll find the thief in a flash. I'm off. -It couldn't have been them. -It's clear. -Well, someone did it. -We can go. -We'll find the thief. - I wonder who the culprit is It could be anyone We're gonna have to snoop around To find the smoking gun I wonder who the culprit is - What motive there could be -They look suspicious. We'll have to work together To solve the mystery We're keeping out an eye And sneaking around If someone's acting fishy Then we're gonna write it down Those two over there What are they doing here? They've got something up their sleeves It's all crystal clear I wonder who the culprit is A human or a beast He'll hide behind disguises But we'll find the little thief I wonder who the culprit is The clock is ticking fast Mrs. Roman. I know we're on his tail So we'll catch him Now is my chance. Oh, yeah, I did it. Off we go to the last crime site. There must be a clue here somewhere. Oops., I'm so sorry. A picture of Ida. What's that? Aw! Aw! Wait! Stop! What's happening now? It's fixed paper. Interesting. That's me, isn't it, as an innocent harmless plush animal fox. Someone coming? I'm out. We're getting so close I think we got the right guy But just when things look certain He pulls out an alibi Hey, what's going on there? Behind that big door I'm thinking maybe these are just The thieves we're looking for Oh man! -Wooo! -Wooo! -Yeah! -Hey. Who is that? Wondraschek? Hmm. Suspicious. Very suspicious. Hey, get your paws off those papers. There's nothing to see there, except for a very slick, plushy animal fox. I wonder who the culprit is The leads are far and few We won't find any answers If we don't find any clues I wonder who the culprit is He slipped out off our sight But the villain's staying hidden Like a shadow in the night Hello? Oh no, not him again. Too close for comfort. Time to disappear. Wondraschek? Wondraschek? Wondraschek. Mmm. What is he doing? Wondraschek is hiding from Siegmann. Very suspicious. Very suspicious. Oh, no. Hey, hey, be careful guys! Wondraschek is hiding behind the... -Ah... -Ah... -Mr. Siegmann. -Mr. Siegmann. What are you two kids doing here, huh? -We just wanted to-- -We just wanted to-- Now, as far as you're concerned young man, you should be studying, Jonathan. And I should probably have a little conversation with your dad about your consistently bad grades. This would be for your own mighty good, of course. And now, I'll escort the both of you out to the playground. -And you, Ivy Kronenberg... -No, I don't. Whatever, I will definitely have my eye on you. And now go play with the other children, you two. What is he doing here? Wondraschek, Wondraschek, Wondraschek. Uh-huh! Wondraschek is the plant destroyer. For your own mighty good. -But is he also the super thief? -Wondraschek. I better take these with me. I wouldn't want to make myself a suspect. You won't believe who I was spying on. Ha, I almost got caught. Anyway, I have an exceptional spooer. I think I know who the super thief is. Begins with a W. Wondraschek? Sly as a fox, my human bestie. True, you're right. He has keys for every door. He's a janitor. -Mm-hmm. -And maybe he wants revenge because Siegmann is always bossing him around. What do you think, Jo? What's wrong? Um, I'll go follow my exceptional lead. You human kids are fine all by yourself. Really, I get it. Human kids need human friends, too. Bye. Is it because Siegmann wants to talk to your dad? Jo... if you want, maybe I can help you in school. Or after school. -I have an idea, we could-- -What about the project, any ideas? Uh, pirates maybe. -Cool, want to work on it with me? -Mm-hmm. I've got to get some stuff done. Bye-bye. Hey, Benni. -Hi, Ida. -About our project. I've done some research on it about Blackbeard, Storderbecker, and Jack Sparrow. -Uh, Benni... -I figure Jack Sparrow wasn't real. But we could show some films and-- Benni, I'll do the pirate project with Jo. We'll do the next one together. You and I, I and you. You know, the both of us. I promise. With Jo? Okay. Benni. Hey, Ida. Internal meeting. Hi, Benni. If you want to, you can sit up front with us. La, la, la, la Yeah. Okay, so we'll meet after school. My earrings. White water rafting? My earrings are gone! Benni, why'd you do that? -What is it? Tell me what happened. -Hey, come on! Why? I haven't done anything wrong! Benni, I know why you're so angry with me. But that's no reason for you to steal my new earrings! Ida! Maybe he's the school super thief. -Give them back to me now! -Benni is super thief. -Very shady. -Very shady. You know what? You're a pea brain like all the others. Hello? Someone in there? Come on, don't give up. Are you a man? A ninja? A pirate? Or just a lonely hermit crab? What do you know about pirates? More than you know about pirates. You don't believe me? Then take a look at this. Time to cast off! Full hands on deck! Look alive, Ben! Blackbeard, Long John Silver, my good friend! Yes, we'll go steal everyone's treasure! It's ours! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wasn't the Wendel and Loverwood waxing today. Whoa! Whoa! Haha! -Are you okay? -Time to get off this mess! What? Those huge swabs. Captain, how are we to get through this storm? -Port Helmin, steersman. -Steerswoman! Steers land tortoise! Okay, give me the wheel. We'll break through the waves with full speed ahead! Aye aye, captain! Oh wow, that's a long presentation. Did you do it all by yourself? No wonder you don't have any time for me. Time to find the thief, I mean. Wondraschek, Benni, who was the crook? I followed all sorts of leads. And I would have to say that it has got to be the one who seems the least suspicious. Benni looked like he was really sad. I am pretty sure that Benni isn't the super thief. -And I am sly. -Mmm? But about pirates, I am absolutely clueless. Um. The word pirate originates from the Latin word pirata, -which is-- -Hey, you don't know that much either. You're just reading from the paper. Today, there are still pirates who hijack ships, murder, kidnap, and even steal. I'm not in the mood to see Ida and everyone else. What are you all standing here around for? Come on, get to class. -Are you? -No. The super thief? You may be a pirate, but you're no thief. The others were unfair, Captain. Totally. Why would I paint smileys and steal my friend's earrings? -Exactly. -Benjamin. Get to class now. Glittering, shiny, bright girl's earrings. Jonathan, listen up. Your principal called me again today. He told me about your continued rude behavior and the fact that your grades are bad. Hmm? If you didn't work all the time, then maybe you would realize that your son requires a lot more of your support. Then how could we afford all of this? Hmm? I wouldn't mind having a little less. We could move into an apartment. Then I'd look like a failure. But I am not a failure. And my son is also not a failure. -Am I making myself clear, Jonathan? -Yeah, whatever. You're a terrible example of a man for him. Just because you coddle him all the time. -Because you're never at home. -That's not true. Your son needs you. Oh, man. School is about to start. -Where's he at? -Where's who at? I wanted to practice a presentation with Jo. With Yo? Why not practice with me? What did the pirates do to cure Skurvy when out at sea? They always had lemon trees for vitamin C on board. Very good. When-- Yo must be waiting in front of the school for me. Okay, now when were the pirates peak years? -It was from 1690 to 1730. -Mm-hmm. I'll see you later. Bye. Well, I don't need to be a sly fox to understand that you don't need me. Oh, my glitzy, glossy sparklies! You betcha! I've brought a new friend for you. My great, gorgeous glitzy. You snazzy, stunning sparklies! Oh. Ah, Benni. It's you. I-- I-- Pinkie. I was just borrowing them, honest. I have to go. I've got a date. Later, alligator. Hey, where were you? What's the big deal? Chill, okay? Ida? Hey, look at what I just found. Because I'm innocent. That's what I am, Ida. Oh, yeah. -Paradoxical evidence. -Very shady. That's right. If you didn't steal them, where did you get them from? True. It was the magpie. That's who it was. And you're the magpie, Benni super thief. Benni, the school thief. I'm sure he did it. It wasn't me. No, it wasn't. Good last words to end a senseless unfair exchange of views. If we can even call it a proper discussion. -And not just a blatant accusation! -No! -It isn't? -It's not fair. You always take Benni's side. Also Ida's. What? Me? -True. -Yeah, exactly. Benni and Ida are always being favored. Enough of this bullcrap! The proof is they get animals and we get nothing. -Right! -It's favoritism! We want animals too! -We want an animal! -We want an animal! -We want an animal! -We want an animal! -We want an animal! -We want an animal! -We want an animal! -We want an animal! -We want an animal! -We want an animal! -We want an animal! -We want an animal! Enough! You are a magical community! You have to stick together, especially those who posses magical animals already. She is right! Now, everybody, time for fresh air. Ida and Jo can do their presentation outside on the main stage. Flurry, flurry, flurry! And, action! Um... Well, now, the golden age of piracy was... He knows less about pirates than you do about tortoises. -The 15th Century? -No, it was from 1690 to 1730. Move on. Well, they definitely lived a long, long time ago. -What? -That's bogus! Huh? Pirates are still around today. Here. Um. Pirates were men with beards? That's bogus. There were women too. Incredible women. They ate tortoises. -Come on, Jo! -That's bogus! You would know, right? Because you're kind of a pirate, Benni super thief. No, dude. It's Benni superbrain. -What does he know? -More than you do. Come on, Benni. Tell them what it was really like. You can do it. Long ago, about a few 100 years A gigantic ship to bones What's all that about? What is he doing? A pirate who goes By the name Blackbeard And history says He's the worst of them all Wretched robber. Yeah, and you don't want to cross him He'd fight for his mates Yes, he'd give up his life I thought you prepared, you didn't even practice. He'd share any treasure With all of his guys Unless he'd have a catch You're talking some crap And then it makes you walk the plank Where you bet And for all my fellow sharks You make a tasty surprise Yeah, I've seen it with my own two eyes So be the pirates Don't care what you say They'll be loyal to the endless You get in their way So be the pirates Don't care what you've heard Even if they're missing There's coffee Blackbeard So be the pirates Don't care what you think No contracts assigned Just a handshake and drinks You gotta have a team That will always stay true So be the pirates That's how I am too I'm no thief and not a clumsy claws. I'm a pirate no matter what you say. -Bravo! -Super Benni! -Very good, Benni. -Super! Very good. And, Jo, instead of chilling, you should have prepared. Mmm? You'll have to do it one more time. What do I care? What's his problem? Wait! What's wrong with him? Jo, what was that? You totally ruined it! Why weren't you prepared? Okay, it was really awful. We'll make up for it next time. -I promise. -We? Hey, you have absolutely no problems. Look at yourself. You have an animal, even excellent grades. -And the old which loves you. -A witch? Our teacher? Okay, not an old one, anyway. Wondraschek? Just forget it. Oh, come on! Detective. We'll go and grab the thief. Come on. You and me, we're still detectives. Come on. -What's he doing? -No idea. Hey! -Ah! -Ah! Hey! Hey, stop there! Jo and I were in Wondraschek's office. It was very suspicious in that room. Then Jo and I ran off. Jo had a super plan to catch the thief. Jo actually said that we-- Jo said that we could maybe-- Jo, Jo, Jo, is he the only person that exists in your world? -What's wrong with you? -What's wrong with me? Well, I thought we too. We too are going to catch the thief. -Yeah. But I thought we could-- -What were you thinking? -Only about Jo? -Ah, what? Yeah. No matter what, you two want to have fun. And Benni being blamed for something he didn't do? -What are you talking about? -That you only care about Jo. Instead, you should be helping a friend in a jam. -You're most definitely jealous. -Jealous? -I want to have fun. -Me? I'm going to stand up for someone who really needs my help. -You can do whatever you want. -I'm going to do what I have to do. I'll find the super thief all on my own. And I'll prove Benni's innocence. Gosh, humans sure are strange animals. Sometimes we say things That we immediately regret Rabbat. - I didn't want to hurt you trust me -Rabbat. - I only want the best -Rabbat. Right now I hope you know That I still need you Humans really are such silly creatures Sometimes we say things That we're not even sure about Didn't want to harm you That's just how the words came out Trust me I don't understand it either Humans really are such silly creatures Ida. Ida? Yeah? I just want to say goodnight to you. -Is everything okay with you? -Mmm. I was sleeping. Sleep tight. -Goodnight, Mommy. -Goodnight. -Aw! -What is it? You're strong at sea. Only one man can save us now! It's your great fella Captain El Capitano! Dododotdorot! What do you see through the telescope, steers tortoise? Left ahead! Mermaids, a giant crocid, and a girl overboard. Huh? Let me see it. Rabbat! Rabbat, where are you? Rabbat! Rabbat. Benni. I'll show Ida. I'll figure this out alone. I will find the super thief. This case was predestined for a master detective. Ah, what's that I smell? The snack machine. There are all the clues, all the delicious chocolatey-chocolate clues. What was that? Ah! Okay, fine. It doesn't matter how yummy all those clues are. Real master detective never lets a new lead just slip out off his paws. Wait a minute, the super thief? This way. Wondraschek. Oh no, not this guy again. Don't turn around. Don't turn around. Mmm? Hmm. What the-- Well, actually, we had a fight. And then Rabbat ran away. All of a sudden he took off. -Do you have a clue to where he went? -No. Ah, yes. -We have to go to the school. -We? Go to the school? In the middle of the night? That is forbidden. And it's spooky. I won't do it. And you know what? You were extremely mean. You really don't know the pirate's code of honor? -The what? -The what? The pirate's code of honor. You don't know it? Huh-huh! Friends in distress must always be forgiven. Benni, I'm sorry. The presentation and the super thief, I made a mess of everything. I really am sorry. And I wasn't there for you, and it's rough being all alone. It's important for me to leave now and find her back. I know it's dangerous, but I can't just leave him alone. Benni, you don't have to come with me. So, Benni, what do you think? Mm-hmm? Ida, wait up! I'm coming too. Thank you. We will find Rabbat and then catch the thief! It brings good luck. I'll just go grab my skateboard. Hmm. Aw! Hello. Long John Silver would be green with envy. Rabbat, here we come! Let's go! Full speed ahead! Aaah! Benni! -Are you okay? -Yeah, yeah. Where's the exit? Ah, here it is. A real lucky charm. Hey, that was cooler than breakdancing. Do it again one more! Someone's coming. -We have to go. -Go where? We have to find a place to hide. Quick! -Henrietta? -Benni, no. Huh? -Where's Henrietta? -Benni. Sssh. Hey there? Could you help a friend out of a jam? Huh! Come on, Captain. Make the scoundrel walk the plank. Long John Silver would be proud! I definitely want to get my skateboard back from him. We'll go to Wondraschek. I bet you he's got Rabbat. Rabbat and my skateboard. Come on. Hey! Hey you kids! Hey, you kids! Open that door! That was close. But a real master detective doesn't let anything get in his way and keeps his cool. Bouncy balls? From up there? Hmm. The super thief must have lost them. So now, it's going to get dangerous. I am on your tail super thief. Super thief, here I come. Come on now, open the door! Only when you finally admit you're the super thief! You guys are going to be in big trouble. Now, open the door! Why don't you just admit that you're the thief? Huh? The gloomy loft. I should've known. It's the lead I've been waiting for. A real master detective can sense that. It must be around here somewhere, the super thief's hide out. What's that? Over there? Light. Ha! Siegmann's chair. The stolen goods. Huh? Who do we have here? You? You're the thief? You're the thief? But you're on our detective team. I just want to get back at the director. It is his fault that my father has been stressing me. Who cares about that? You've been lying to Ida. I never wanted Ida to be dragged into this. Anyway, you too have been spying on me. I have to tell her the truth. -The truth about you. -No! I'm not the school thief. I'm the one who's looking for the school thief. Now, open this door right now! And why did you draw all those smileys? And snoop all over the direct's office? The direct? -The director. -The director. I was investigating the crime scene. Now, open this door right now! Benni, open this door. -What was that? -What? Rabbat? Rabbat? Hey, come back! -Let me through. -Rabbat, I can't do that. -Please, my father will kill me. -Let me go right now. -No, Rabbat. Please! -Get out of my way now! Rabbat, come on. Okay, you leave me no other option. Then I'll have to take the fastest possible way down. Rabbat, no! Are you nuts? No! Good thing that foxes have nine lives. I'm off. Rabbat! No! -Awooo! -Let's go. Rabbat! Let me out of here! It's for your own mighty good! He must be here somewhere. Yeah, come on. That must be the thief's hideout. -There's Rabbat. -Ida, careful. -Rabbat! -Not so loud. The super thief. It looks like Long John Silver's treasure chamber. This must be the hideout. What did I tell you? Real pirates don't only have to forgive each other, but also stick together. Yeah. You are the thief? What's going on here? You were just tricking us along the entire time? -Where's Rabbat? -I don't know! All of a sudden he just jumped out of the window! Rabbat! Ginger! Ginger! What are you doing here? Ida, no! No, no, stay there! Ida, this is way too high for kids. You don't have nine lives like I do, like foxes do. I'll come to you. Wait up. Ida, you know it's not safe. Come inside. Ginger! Aaaah! -Rabbat! -Aaah! Help me! Help me! I am coming! Oh no, I remember now. It's cats, not foxes. Cats have nine lives. Ida... stop! Come back! It's way too dangerous! Rabbat, I'm coming. No, Ginger, I can do it alone. I'm fine. I don't need your help. We will need to pull Rabbat back down from the pipe -with a very long rope. -Good idea! Ida, hold on, we'll go get a rope for you right now! Go back now. I mean it! Let's go. I'll catch you down from there. No. Be careful! Go back! Wait a sec, Ida! Ida, stay back! -Aaah! -Help! Benni! Ida! Ida, Ida, I'm coming, Ida! I'm coming. Wait, Jo. Help, Benni! Help! Benni! What window is that one floor below where they are now? Yeah! It's from the director. Off we go to the direct's office. Help is on the way! Don't move an inch. Yeah, it's good idea. I told you it's way too dangerous. Rabbat... -Um, Ida... -I-- I totally messed up. I was, I was wrong because I thought I could do it all alone. Yeah. And I really messed it up too. But I can't do it alone. And now, you came to save my life. Now, your life has been put in danger too. I wanted to tell you- Because of me, and it's all totally dangerous. Yeah, I wanted to say that... Yes, Ida? That you're so, that so important to me. Yeah, Ida, you are too! -Aw, aw, awooo! -Awooo! I have a key. -How? -From Wondraschek. -Huh? -Come, Benni! Hurry! -Ida, we're coming. Hold on! -Ida! -We'll get you down! -Hurry up! -Come quicker! -They're finally here! Hurry up! -You can do it! -Ben! Captain, here! -Get it, Ida! -You got it! -You can do it! -That's it. -Come on, Ida. -Great job, boys! -Come on, Ida! -Catch it! Little higher! -Friends forever? -Friends forever! -Hurry up! -Ida! Be very careful! -Give me your hand! -Hurry! No. -Give me your hand! -Pull me over! No. -Quickly! -Closer! Come on! Ida, you can do it! Come on! -Aaah! -Aaah! Rabbat! No stress. I'm just hanging out over here. -Rabbat! -I've got you, Jo! Well, for a sly and sporty fox like me, that was child's play. Yeah, yeah, what do you mean child's play? How come that you're such a sly fox? Yay! Whoa! Whoa! No! Anyhow, I like chocolatey-chocolate chip cookies way more than these yucky old turnips. Ah, not only is he a sly fox, but what an appetite. -Uh-huh! -Woah! And who do we have here? Benni, Ida, Jo. Well, I'll be damned. What a horrible mess. What happened here? Today, we'll discuss one of my favorite subjects. It's the atmosphere. It's the air surrounding our planet in about 631 miles thick. Okay, just so we're all on the same page, this is about integrity, communication, collaboration, turnips. -Anyway, it's all about telling the truth. -Mm-hmm. Property damage, theft, and burglary. This is a serious matter and will be punished accordingly. Whose idea was it? Who is the ringleader? Take a look at this girl. She looks like she could be the ringleader. She is Ida! My daughter is the nicest and kindest girl in the world. You're out of your mind! Well, in my opinion, it's those countless hours playing games and being on that cell phone that are to blame. What did you say? Calm down, everyone, for your own mighty good. Please, Ida, you can tell all of us what happened. Okay? Jo, tell us which one of these guys is guilty. Huh? Was it this Ivy? -Ida! -Ida! Yeah, whatever. Or this weird somewhat oddball over there. -Whoa, what did he say? -Yeah, pale. I forgot that one. My son has proven that he's a truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, -truly great boy. -For god sake! Who did it, huh? Now, don't forget, it's your responsibility. -Pirates go to the water. -Pirates go to the water. If no one talks, you're all expelled. All of you! Understand all of you will be expelled from school. There must be a ringleader in the bunch of sensible painless clumsy claws. It's not possible that they did it. So if you ask me, the guilty party can only be the loner Ilene. -Ida! -Ida! Yeah, whatever. -Or Mr. Cool himself, Jo. -Hey, Dr. Siegmann. I like that word. You're so wrong about everything. Totally. Hey, Director Siegmann-- -Wondraschek! -What? Oh, please, let her speak her mind. -Yeah, but-- -You're wrong about everything. What is it you're trying to tell me? You have no clue about who your students really are. Aaaw! That means? Well then, who was it? Benni, for example, he's not only a good boy, he's the bravest and most fantastic boy that I know. He'll be true to himself in whatever he wants to, even when everybody picks on him. What are you trying to say? At first I thought all the kids here are stupid. But the reality is that they're different. - Pella and her group loves soccer. -What? Yeah, we like soccer. That bunny girl loves soccer? Wow! And Jo's friends can knit. - And Shoka makes yummy cupcakes. -Yeah, he sure does. And Jo... he's not as cool as he think. So, it was Jo. Well, he's got it pretty tough at home... -because they're always arguing. -Uh-huh? I don't fight, okay? I discuss, yeah. I'm going to need you to shut up and listen! And Ida isn't a loner, because from now on we're gonna stick together because we're friends now. That's enough, Benni. Ilene. -Ida! -Ida! Oh, whatever. Are you the super thief or not? Admit it. I'll have to expel you from school. -No, but-- -It's okay, Ida. Jo, you don't have to be the super, super-- Jo, Jo, Jo! I am the super thief. -What? -What? - It was me. -Oh no. - I'm very sorry. -I didn't know. I found Wondraschek's keys that made it all possible -to get in and steal stuff. -What? What the-- I thought that was pretty cool with an extra spot for the stash. But to be honest, I was weak and stupid. I would leave when my parents were fighting over me. I'm so sorry. Sorry that I pulled you two into this mess. Sorry that everyone thought that you two were the thieves. If you, and you know who, had fallen from the roof... I wouldn't have never gotten over it. We're still friends, all of us. Jonathan... even if you've now admitted to it... I will still have to expel you from the school. -What? -What? No way! This is for your own mighty good, I'm sure. Lesson learned. Yes, we'll be in touch with you both. I will unfortunately have to begin with the expulsion process. Wait, what? You have nothing to do with this now. Jo was just saying all of that to protect me. The cat is out of the bag. I am the super thief. -Benni, don't be silly. -My son, hey, Ben! Mr. Siegmann, you remember, don't you? When you caught me red-handed? It was me who stole the candy bars. -I'm the real super thief. -See, there you have it. -What did I tell you? -No, it was me! I stole the school clock. I love clocks! I'm the super thief! -Mr. Siegmann, Mr. Siegmann. -Mr. Siegmann, Mr. Siegmann. We're the ones who stole the turnips. We love turnips. -We are the super thieves. -We are the super thieves. No, it was me. I was the one who ate them. -We're the super thieves! -We're the super thieves! No, Mr. Director, we're the super thief. We stole your chair. -And just rolled off with it. -No, we did it. -It was us. -No, us! I want to be a super thief too. So many more super thieves. -We're the baddest super thieves. -We're the baddest super thieves. -I'm the super thief. -Wait a minute. Quiet! So who was it after all? -Me! -Me! Now maybe you'll have to expel us all. Mmm. Well, in order to teach you all a lesson, no expulsion but hard work. -Yes! -Yes! -Yah! -And detention! -Yah! -And make this school spotless. Scrub the super thief from every surface. -Yay! -Yay! Now off you go. Wonderful children. Wonderful children. You're pretty lucky. You have a great class. I'm so happy. Oh, I knew I wouldn't need to worry too much about you. So many new friends. Go on now. Hurry. What can I say? I guess I came on more than likely a bit too strong. A bit? You're oblivious. Can we all just keep our mouth shut? -You're right. -Oh, my love. Go on now. Wondraschek... -What? -A great example Ilene. -Ida. -Ida, like I said, anyone should remember for her own might good. -For her very own good. -Oh, Wondraschek. Hmm. I told you, my friend, a magical community. You betcha. Where's naughty Pinkie? You mean Mrs. Super Thief? Together we're strong As a bear and a bull You got my back if I ever fall We're sharing our troubles And I scream at life If you turn the fun That'd be nice If you send all the dogs out And party away all your problems let the monkeys run wild Hands to the sky Let the volume high play The songs loud One for all and all for one for bears and for us And for donkeys and swans For people and pets Any shape, any size Oooh, hey, hey Good friends stick together as one Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Hey, hey Spending time full of magic and fun Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh hey, hey -Hey there, Henrietta? -Yeah, Rabbat?
