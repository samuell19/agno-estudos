But before that, I wrote you a letter. So did you? Thank you, Mau! PAU AND MAU SAVE THE WORLD Kids, please sit down. Take out your notebooks and write down your homework, immediately please. Paulina Mendoza! Sit down, please. I mean, did you really just mistake me for... her? I'm Paula, not Paulina. I mean, I don't even know how you pay for this school, because I have everything I want, but you... you're losers! What's wrong with you? Get off me! - You're annoying! - No, you are annoying! - I'm not annoying! - Leave me alone! 15 YEARS LATER Baby, what's up? Talk! Sorry, miss Paula. Well... We'll start the day with your Body Barre instructor. Then we'll have a Marrakech with your friends. - Beauty salon... - I start the day, I go on with my day. Me, Lore. Singular. My agenda is not for the both of us. Oh, and it's not "Body Barré." It's "Body Barre." I can't pay for your English lessons if you won't do your best. Really. I'm sorry. Then, the day goes on having a Marrakech with your friends. And then go through the checklist for your engagement party with your fiancé... "It's been ten years and we must celebrate." Class reunion! Enough, baby! Forget everything. This! What am I going to wear? I have nothing! Look at my closet. Come on, baby. - Get me something cool, will you? - Yes. - Oh, and Lore... - Yes? - Don't let my nanny hear you... - Yes. ...but tell Enedina that my bathroom is not spotless. Say what? That's what she told me. I'm sick of her! Spoiled, unhappy girl. And she's getting worse every day. - Pass the ball! - Here! What the hell? Julio! Pass the ball! Mom, the eggs! Come on! Sit down! Good morning, pumpkin. What a mess. Cleaning time! Did you burn them again? Damn. Start all over. Mom, cereal! Come on, Pau! Tell us what you'll wear! Yes! Oh, Ani, you'll be crazy jealous with that huge belly. I mean, getting pregnant is not chic. I mean, dude, you only say that because Antonio effing hates kids. No, make no mistake, honey. If I wanted to, we'd obviously have kids, but I don't want to. No doubt about it: I have the perfect life. Dude, perfect. But, I must confess... I do have butterflies in my stomach thinking of seeing Mau at the party! Jeez, Ms. Agripina! Where do you put your feet? Paulina! How dare you talk to her like that? She's one of our best clients! She brings her nails with fungus every day. If you keep on victimizing yourself, how will you become... a businesswoman? I will not. My dream of owning something like this is dead. I'm glad, it's for the better. Homie, look what we got! Hey, homie! Guicha, show some dignity. I am never going to hire you. You'll regret it, Blondie. But no. Today I'm here because there will be a 10-year class reunion! Only you graduated. You fell short for just a year. Let that go already! Blondie, tell her! What do you want me to tell her? That for being horny you ruined your life and now you have to do Mrs. Agripina's feet. So? Come on! Yes? Don't know, let me work! BLONDIE MANICURE Thank you. Chin up, please. Re! Come. - Let's go. - You look gorgeous. You too! - Iñaki. - Hey. So glad to see you. Come on in. - Come. - Hey! Tony. Welcome, and thank you for being here. Thank you to my mother-in-law for this lovely engagement party. And, well, the wedding is getting close. And... nothing. Babe. Thank you, love. And I'm going to be the world's #happiest girl! Bravo! Let's hear it for the bride and groom! - Thanks. - Tony! Tony. What are you doing? It's our engagement party. Damn it, this is globally boring. And these are your guests, okay? Tony, don't take me for granted. One day, I may be the one leaving. And where would you go? You'd die if you didn't have all of this. María Paula, there you are! Victoire wants to talk to you. How dare you talk to Tony like that? Our rescuer. Are you not getting that your dad left us penniless? Come on, Mom, don't be so dramatic, he didn't leave us penniless. He didn't? What about the plane? The house in Vail? The apartment in New York? Come on, let him be. Come. Let's be the hostesses our guests deserve. Here. Pumpkin! You look gorgeous! Hey, it's been years since we last went to that motel where you scream my name. Piss off, José. Oh, come on! We need to be alone. We're broke, man! You just don't get it, do you? I'll be damned. You know what? Tell your posh friends to buy you a new temper! Yeah. And they'll only remind me of what I could have been and how unlucky we are. Damn. All I hear is insults. Goddamn women. Nanny. You don't look so good lately. I'll move you to the guest room so I can be close to you. No, I'm good here. What is it? What's wrong? Nothing. Why? What is this? For you to remember me, always. It's kind of weird. But gorg. I will keep it forever. Thank you. I'm leaving because I need to get ready. But I love you. Let's go! And you didn't want to come! There's Mau! Be discreet! I mean... aren't you going to kiss me? - Hey! - Hey, Mau! Remember when we used to say we were going to save the world? Come. - Come. - What? Come! Be honest. Are you crazy for him? What kind of question is that? Please tell me you are. And erase this that I haven't stopped feeling for you. Do you remember? You and I, always. I can't. I have to go. Did you see my break dance? Come on! Take it out! I'll be goddamned! I love our little bathroom meetings! You're not going to smoke that in here, are you? What? Why not? This is not your bathroom. Hey! - Easy, cheesy. - Excuse me? - What's wrong with her? - What do you mean? Look! She's in desperate need of a good lay. Oh, honey. You know what? Beat it, go with your love children! I've heard you'd die for one yourself. Don't talk to me like that, you illiterate! I'll talk to you as I please. And I'm smarter than you. What? Knock her teeth off! Come on! - Hit her hard! - Félix! Kick her in the nuts! Hit her! My hair, you moron! Let go of her! Félix, take a good look at her. Don't ever let her near me! You wish, Gucci girl! Right, homie? What's wrong? You're on a very bad trip! Get over here, pumpkin, I'll help you with that hangover. Pumpkin? What's going on? Paulina! Miss... ...Paula. What the hell? I don't know what I'm doing here. I'll get your hangover pill, miss... Paula. Paula? Paula? No, come on, no. No, okay, this is a nightmare! A nightmare! I'm obviously dreaming! I'm dreaming! Oh, no. No fucking way. No fucking way! Miss... Paula... I'm Paula Mendoza from head to toe! Ain't I? I think I'll go get you something stronger. Oh, God, I'm dying! Oh, God! Who's hungover? Did you drink champagne and got wound up? I'll help you in the kitchen. How do you turn this thing on? No. No, this... Hello! Oh, God. No way! Pumpkin! If I am here... then Paula is... in my body? Paulina! In my life? Hell, yes! What is it? Mom, you look awful! - Lady! - What did you do? Nothing. - Nothing? - Nothing. Pick that up! - Pumpkin? - Mom? Yes! Yes! Hell, yeah. Right on. This is karma. And I'm staying here. For the time this thing lasts. No, wait. What about the twins? José will have to take care of them for once. Hermes? - Miss Paula... - What the hell? Don't you knock? I brought your mom's drops. Do you want me to read today's agenda? Sure. First... Fit Box, then... Hangover Friday Brunch with your friends. Then, trial wedding dinner with your fiancé, master Antonio. Nope. I mean... No. You know what? You... - You... - Lorena. - That's right! - "Baby." That's right. Cancel everything. - Everything? - Everything! I mean... - And what are we going to do? - I mean... I'm... miss... Paula... Mendoza. FACE RECOGNITION Of course! GIRL, WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY? HANGOVER FRIDAY BRUNCH! BABE... That slut... BABE, I NEEDED TO TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE THE LOVE OF MY LIFE. WE'RE CONNECTED. WE FELT IT YESTERDAY, RIGHT? LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART. YOU AND I, ALWAYS. No way! PAU WRITING... - I'm miss Paula Mendoza! - She's a stranger. I'm not a stranger! I mean, don't you get it? Camerino, open the door! What's going on here? Félix! What a relief! - Let me explain. - You can't get near miss Paula. What's wrong with you? I'm miss Paula! - Let go of me! - I said I didn't want to see her! Fucking witch! What did you do to me? Just so you can have some fun with my love children. OMG, I hate you! Félix, please listen to her! I don't talk like that! You have three seconds to leave my body! Mom! Mom, it's me! Paula! - Who's this lunatic? - Help, Mom! - Vladimir, go! Crazy! - Mom, it's Paula! - Mom! - Go, Vladimir! A lunatic! "Mom"? No! Not a taxi! I'd rather die! No! No! You are all going to regret this! Worst timing for your little joke! I'm getting married, don't you get it? No, Félix, please! Please, Félix! Pau... lina! Ok, so you can stop moping! Find La Prieta, she's from your neighborhood. - She'll know what to do. - You're not the boss of me! Find her yourself! Then don't! I'm happy to stay here! Good luck with my three men! No, wait! Paulina! Where am I going? What the hell! Baby! Is this how it's going to work? Relax, girl, the rain is over. Now the sun will come. What did you do for them to treat you like that? It's none of your business! Just drive! - I don't know where we're going. - We're... Grupo Vela! Turn Waze on. Come on, girl, please! Look at my cell phone. - I don't have Waze. - Are you kidding me? But I'm better than Waze! Just tell me where to go. Polanco, obviously! The street is... What's the name of the street? Relax, girl, I'll take you to the end of the world. Don't touch me! Don't even look at me! Gross! Okay, you've crossed the line! And I'm not picky. Out. Get out! Beat it! Come on! Let someone else put up with you! You're getting zero stars! And she's also an idiot! This is not an Uber! Fool! Oh, God! What am I going to do now? It's Hangover Friday Brunch! Now this is a decent breakfast! Now what? Do you want some? Get a plate! 30 DAYS UNTIL THE WEDDING What do you think happened between Pau and Mau? They obviously hooked up! That's why that bitch isn't answering. Dude! If Pau picks Mau, I want Antonio. No way! I practiced my famous nut rub on him, and he loved it! You bitch! Excuse me? I'll pretend I didn't just hear that because this is some serious shit. - What is this? - No idea. I really needed that. Oh, God! You too? Girls, please don't look at me like that. I know I look like that trash Paulina, but no. Paula. I can't believe it! - Are you kidding? - Hilarious! And wearing yesterday's dress. - Get up and leave. - Beat it! No, I'm serious, girls! You have to believe me! Paulina is a witch! She did this to me! You mean you...? So sweet, let me record this. Hey! Don't do that! I mean it! I'm panicking! I have nowhere to go, no credit cards, nothing! Paulina is in my house, with my body, with my baby Lore. I'm not kidding! I'm serious! What's wrong with you? Don't touch me! What do you want me to tell you? Anything! Andy, who waxed your first mustache? I did! And Re, I'm sorry, but for your birthday I taught you the secrets for your famous nut rub! I did! - You know what? Get her out ASAP! - No! This is so embarrassing! Girls, come on! You know it's me! Paula Mendoza! - What the fuck? - Don't know, dude. Get her away and don't let her back! I really need a bodyguard! You're Juanito! I come here every Friday! It's me! You're getting fired! You're going to regret this! What's wrong with you? Is this a bus stop? Will the bus stop here? Okay. - Get in line! - In line! Please! I don't have an umbrella! I'm soaked! - Please! Please help me! - No! Get in line! Get in line! Please! Oh, God! I can't...! What is this? - Hey! Get in line! - Get in line! Get in line, you moron! Hey, that leg is mine! Oh, please, you're not that hot. Come on, surely hotter than you. - She's with me. - I'm not! What's wrong with you? He's my uncle, you moron! - Really? - Really. And you know what? Get off the bus before I kick your ass! - Catfight! - Catfight! Easy now! Oh, yes, please! I'm being bullied! - Catfight! - Catfight! I'm out of here! This is horrible! You're horrible people! Bye bye, princess! Where am I, sir? The little princess left! Hey, you! What's wrong with you? Fuck you! Okay... Oh, no! Thank God! Hey! Excuse me. La Morena? I don't know, miss. Hey! La Morena? No idea. Morena? I'm sorry. Sweet buns. You're looking for La Prieta, aren't you? Yes! La Prieta! Right! - Do you know her? - Do I know her? I sure do. Jeez! Such a relief! You're my hero! Please, tell me, where can I find her? An exchange would be in order. No, I have no change! I mean... look at this! This is all I have! - Not even enough for the arcade. - Please! I'm desperate! Hey, wait! You said exchange. In exchange for what? Here? Really? Sure. But somebody might see us. That's not a problem, sexy. I'll keep you covered, sweet buns. You're kidding me, right? Just relax... Oh, shut up! Fine! Just a peek, okay? - So pretty! - Enough! Okay, now, tell me, where's La Prieta? LA PRIETA Welcome. Please, come in. Take a seat. PAULA I LOVE YOU María Paula Mendoza! What are you doing? Your bodyguards told me you've been here all day. Why? Speak properly! As socialités and influencers, we must look busy all day, okay? I'm finally leaving for my spiritual retreat tomorrow, I need it so bad. I don't want any trouble while I'm away, okay? Well! Sweet buns. Pretty, delicious lady! Take a seat here. Holy crap! You scared me. Holy crap! Nice to meet you... Prieta. That's your name, isn't it? Oh, God. Okay, let me explain. The thing is I'm here because I have no idea how, but today I woke up in this body. I mean, I am me inside, but not outside, obviously. So, what I want is for you to put me back in my body right now. You heard me, right? I did. And that's some tough shit. Because this spell was cast specially for you. And you have to learn from this shit and work hard. No! What? I'm sure you can do something! Anything! I'm marrying Mexico's fifth richest man in a month! Please, I'll pay you! You can have a huge makeover! Because, I mean, have you seen yourself? The underworld tells me: "Beware!" If you don't learn before the next moon cycle, nothing will change you back, not even all the money in the world, and you're going to stay like this... ...forever. I'll be damned! Paulina! Where the hell have you been? I was really worried about you. If you don't learn before the next moon cycle, nothing will change you back. The thing is... And still wearing yesterday's clothes? What happened, pumpkin? I was really worried. No... nothing. Come on, let's go inside. No, I'm fine. Everything's fine. I just need to go to bed because I'm really tired... and I need to go to bed, but... I'll explain tomorrow, okay? Fine. Right... Pumpkin! Oh, no. - The little guy is up. - No! What's wrong? You never say no to the little guy in the morning. The thing is... I'm on my period, so... - Ew. - Ew? Since when are you so prudish? It's your turn to fix breakfast. And lunch for soccer practice! Lunch? No hair, such a ho. Miss Paula! Mr. Antonio's here! Lore! Baby! Lore! Good morning. - Where's Paula? - In her bedroom. Paula! Paula? I'm sorry, I'm very ill. Are you kidding me? How can you cancel on me? You don't even answer the phone! I'll bring the bachelor party forward. Heck. Bye. Miss... Paula... Hey. Hello, mate! Are the gin tonics ready? I'll arrange the bird to take us to Ibiza tonight. Great, mate! We're gonna have so much fun! Oh, no. No! Don't play here! Go over there! Let me go! I'm sick of you! Mom, the stove! Oh, God! Help me! Do something! Oh, no! You're something, pumpkin! I almost got burned, and look what your children did to me! - What you taught them to do. - I almost die! Get it? "Get it"? Oh, God! This is disgusting! Hey, pumpkin... What's wrong with you? That's your hair! Don't! That'll teach you to clean your mess. - Back off! - I'm helping you! What's up? Show your teeth! You're everything but boring. What's this you're wearing? Your panties will show. What? Why? What do you mean? 'Cause of your work. Well, bye. This is me, right? - Bye! - Let's go! It's getting late! Love you, pumpkin! Look who's gracing us with her presence. - Excuse me? - Was it such a good party? Right. Yes, awesome. When I had wild sex nights, - back when I had teeth... - Please, don't. - ...I would perform "the bolt"... - No! Yuck! Stop it! Disgusting! Paulina! Your nails! What? What about my nails? Look, just because I'm becoming a Christian I won't fire you. You didn't come to work yesterday. Fine. I'll give you one chance. Get to work. - The thing is... - Come on. So, are you buying the product? I can give you a discount. Is your face burning? No. Mrs. Agripina's nails are waiting for you. No. You're so sweet. Doll, please! Do you really think I'll do that? I'd rather die! Look, dye is done. You, come here. Use tone 234 for the lady with the green face. I cant' stand this life! Goal! - Goal! - Yeah! Hell, yes! Good night. No! Pumpkin! No, really! Please! No, thanks! It's got hot sauce on it. Try it! - Dude! - I don't get it. Pau must be on drugs! After this, she can kiss her sponsors goodbye. She's not answering her phone! INCORRECT PASSWORD INCORRECT PASSWORD What? "Leopard print is in"? Oh, God, she...! This isn't funny! My cell phone is soaked! It's not funny at all! Why are you laughing! My cell phone is soaked! - That's not funny! - Yes, it is. - Hey, enough! - You shouldn't laugh! I'm fed up with you. Out! Are you firing me? I'm happy to get out of this place! Great, because ungrateful people are unlucky! 15 DAYS UNTIL THE WEDDING It's horrible, people are horrible, things are horrible... How dare they? Hey! Oh, no! What's wrong, homie? What happened to you? Are you okay? Slow down, because now I see pulque makes you act like a snob. I have something to confess. Are you ready? I have something to confess. - Tell me, homie. - Dude! - What? - This isn't my body! This isn't mine, either. No, Guicha, I mean... I swear I'm doing my best, like that witch or that Negro woman told me... La Prieta. What did she tell you? She talked about the moon, about the underworld, No, dude, wait, that's nothing. I mean, I'm getting married really soon, Guicha! I mean my wedding with Mexico's fifth richest man is in two weeks, dude! - You're talking nonsense. - No, Guicha! You're already married to the man with the richest heart! - Damn you, Guicha! - I want to be like you! Check, please. 'Cause we're drunk... What? You don't give a shit about me? I'm not in the mood for a lecture. I've been calling you. Yes, my shitty phone died. I got fired. I got bullied. I got mugged. I feel like shit! And a bitch... is ruining my life. Anything else... ...pumpkin? - Come here. - No! - Come here. - Leave me alone. No. Let me go. No, pumpkin. I will never let you go. It's my turn to pamper you. You've worked hard for us since you were 17. We made a pact a million years ago. I haven't given you the life that you dream of, but you're always in my heart, because I live for you. And I love you with all my might. I'll fix you some dinner. Yes, like that. Be careful. What do you want? Tamales? A quesadilla? No. Escargots. Es... What? Escargots! Well, I'll ask the neighbor, maybe she has some. Your favorite breakfast, Mom! We made it ourselves. Thank you. I had to ask the neighbor for longaniza and tortillas. You've got us starving, just fruit and water. Okay, boys, get your stuff. Bye, Mom. Get well soon. Get well, Mom. Love you. What did you tell them? That I was dying? You should've seen them the day you went missing. I told them that could happen again. If they weren't nice. And I told Blondie that you had the flu and she said that she'd give us one last chance. And... they called from the kids' school again. They're not doing well. Juli has no clue about the play and Juanito's notes are terrible. That if their grades don't improve, they'll be kicked out. Can you explain what's going on with you? Shoo! Look at you! And those pictures! You're trying to embarrass me, aren't you? What's wrong with you? Look, I don't know what drugs you're in, but this wasn't our deal. Erase all that nonsense and go back to the original wedding plan. And tomorrow, I need you to look bootylicious at 9 PM, to welcome the ambassador. Okay? Okay. Pau. Nine PM. Bootylicious. Sharp. Come on, baldy. What a jerk! The worst. Love you! GOALS - BUSINESS FAMILY/TRAVEL BEAUTY SALON GENERAL BUDGET "Volunteer work course." Yeah, right. Hello? Pumpkin! Hello! Mr. José Agustín Nicolás? Yours truly. What can I do for you? Mr. José Agustín, you just won an all-inclusive trip to Acapulco. AC, bathroom included! What? Relaxing massage and champagne for you and a plus one. Your wife. Miss, are you serious? María Paula Mendoza! Miss? Hello? Look! I had to come back like this! And why? Because Antonio called me threatening to call off the wedding because, apparently, you lost your mind. Damn. MEXICAN NIGHTS Okay, I have to go. I'm at this thing. Okay. Are you wearing the tiara I bought you for our wedding? And what's with the Quinceañera hairstyle? At least impress them with your French. Antonio Vela. Nice to meet you. Let me introduce you to my fiancée, Paula Mendoza. She's fluent in French. Two kisses on the cheek. Not... like... No... Don't touch them. Guacamole and tortilla chip! Excuse us. One second. - We'll see you in a moment. - Arrivederci. What do you mean, arrivederci? What the hell are you doing? I wanted them to try the guacamole, it's a Mexican night. Guacamole, my ass! A global embarrassment! It's delicious... This is the last time, or else I swear the deal's off. How are you? Good to see you. Long time, no see. Is everything okay? We're leaving, because she's not feeling well. But anyway, take care. Come on, let's go. Man, come on! Come on, let's go. Hello? Paula. Paulina? Yes, Paulina! Who else? Did you find La Prieta? Yeah. I did see her. So? What did she say? How can we swap back? Well, it sucks. She literally told me this was a test for me and... If you didn't do this, then this test is for you too! I mean, you have to make a real effort! What do you mean? Explain! I am! Just listen! We need to learn from this in order to swap back. Stop missing me, I'm home! Fuck you! Really, fuck you. I brought you a little present. Sleep tight. HUNNY BUNNY, NEVER FORGET THAT IT'S YOU AND I I ADORE YOU, YOUR JOSÉ You and I always, Mau. Blondie. I really appreciate this. Thank you for this opportunity, I'll do my best. Everything will be perfect. I swear. Fine. I'll give you a hand. - Come on. Get to work. Go! - Thank you! You have angels hands. You can take pictures of everything. Don't get angry, okay? There! You look gorg! It's super cool. Fist bump. Hey! Come on! Here, eat this. I love you! Fuck, yeah! UNKNOWN I need to go out. Fine. Follow the instructor. Boys! Atole? Does it come with a pair of buns? Oh, you're so naughty! Ms. Prieta? I'm really sorry, Ms. Prieta! I need to talk to you for a moment, if possible. Talk. Look, Ms. Prieta, the thing is, I'm desperate because I experienced the swap spell, and I'm done, I really need to go back to my life, to my family. So you are the other creature involved in the swap. That would be me, yes. And I know that you are... very famous and you know a lot about many things. And so, I can't lose my children and my husband. Creature... this happens when two people need to teach something... to each other. No one can help you, except yourselves. But, Ms. Prieta, why did this happen to us? We hadn't seen each other in years, we're nothing to each other! Stop right there. For this to work, there are two rules: you must share the same blood, and two, you must possess the same previously cursed object. Of course! These curses don't work just like that! - We're here. - What? - Why are you here? - We found her. - Why are you taking her? - What you say is impossible! - We're not related! - Think, girl! Think! The moon cycle is ending and you have learned nothing! Lore! Ene! Toña! Toña, why are you crying? It's Mrs. Luz. Mrs. Luz, your nanny! Oh, right, my nanny. - What's wrong with her? - Come. What do you mean? Come. We're losing her. Go in. I thought you'd never come. Don't be scared, girl. It's been ages since I last saw you. Your life hasn't been easy. But now you appreciate it, don't you? Take care of your husband and children. You have no idea how lucky you are. She's delirious. You know something, don't you? Bring my girl back to me. I can't leave without seeing her again. Easy, now. Hello? Ana? Hello? Who is this? It's Paula, dude. I am hoarse. Paula? Dude, what the hell? Shit! I've looked for you everywhere! Your cell phone, your house, with Lore... Yes, I know, but... You're getting married tomorrow and I haven't seen you in a month! I know, but I really need you to help me with something. Of course! What is it? I need to talk to Mau and I don't have his phone number. She needs Mau's phone number. He doesn't have one. He cancelled his cell contract. Dude, he's moving to London tomorrow, he doesn't have a cell phone anymore. Hello? Pau? Homie, let me check your highlights. We don't want your hair to get ruined. Oh, right. Old as I am, I still give Brayan blow jobs. Jennifer's brother, she's Kevin's mom. Oh, Kevin is such a hunk! Hey, what if I hook you up with Kevin tonight? Of course! Guicha? Kevin. - Hey. - Hi. Pleasure. - The pleasure's mine. - Let's dance. If the gods are so kind. Wait. Wait? No way! Let's have fun, dance, have a great time! I've been thinking. I'll get a second job to ease your load. And I'll train the kids on weekends to turn them into Chicharitos, while you rest. Pumpkin... I'm the luckiest man on Earth for having you. Tell me something nice. Talk love to me. Honestly, there's something I need to tell you. Hey, we need to go! - What? - There's been an accident at work. Let's go! Pumpkin! You look lovely! Shut up! 1 DAY UNTIL THE WEDDING Fuck off! I mean, I'm super hot! Well, I miss myself. Yes, moron, I miss myself, too. I'm here because I know who can help us out of this. Who? - Who? - You don't look too worried about your wedding, and it is... tomorrow. I'm super worried, I'm dying. - I'm uber worried, 100% worried. - Jeez! Brace yourself - for what I'm about to tell you. - What? You won't believe me, but I swear to God. What? Your man... Antonio... Oh, you're so prude! He's gay! He's into men! You scared me! You knew? No, you're fucked up. You can't marry him! Not for all the money in the world. I mean... Your house is a mess! I had to google how to clean a toilet! Your poor kids eat junk food all day and they're struggling in school. And your "pumpkin" wants love all day long! - That's fucked up! - You know what? Yes. We're both in deep shit. Honestly, we are. Fine! Who can help us out? Your nanny. My nanny? Luz? Damn right. "Your nanny, Luz..." She knows something. But she's about to kick the bucket. No, wait! That means "dying", right? Why do you speak to me in code? Forget Uber! There are taxis around the corner! Hurry! What's wrong with you? And where are my bodyguards? You'll get kidnapped! Well, I will! ...hollowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done... Nanny! -Who is this? -That's her niece. - Her niece? - My sweet girl! You know who I am. You made it. Nanny, get well, please. You can't leave me. I have no one, I'm all alone. You're not alone. I will always be with you. Paula, ask her. Nanny, you know what happened to us, don't you? - I do. - How can we swap back? You can... ...swap back... ...yourselves if... If what? I'll be damned. - Speak! - I don't know what you're up to, but, as far as I know, she doesn't have a niece. Wait a minute, Toña! You have to go! They're coming! Nanny, honey. Please help us, or else I will never be able to come back. Come on! Great. Fantastic how you got the information! Hey, don't you talk to her like that! Help me, Virgin Mary, please. I will not go back to my old ways, but please, help me out of this. No fucking way! No fucking way! Lady D! My boys! My pumpkin! Morning! How fucking lucky I am! - No, wait! The kids! - Right! What? What is it? Brazilian pumpkin! That slut! Awesome! Paula, wake up. María Paula. Wake up! Honey, I have bad news for you. You know your nanny was very ill last night. But anyway, she passed away last night. The doctor came, they gave her oxygen, but she didn't make it through the night and... Are you listening to me? Luz is dead! Talk to me! Your nanny is dead! Paula? Nanny! No! Nanny, no! No! Nanny! No...

You must read this. MY SWEET GIRL My beloved child, I only have a little time left to live. That's why I did something: changed your life to make you understand that money isn't happiness, but most of all, to put you in your half-sister's shoes, Paulina. Shortly before his wedding, your dad got Teresa, his assistant, pregnant. Your mom knows it all. I'd never lie to you. She is your family. You need each other. I know that you have a big heart and you'll know what to do. I love you, Nanny. I love you, my child. Enjoy and love each other forever. Are you my sister? Yes. You are my sister. And I've treated you like shit. Forgive me, please. There she is! What is this? I mean... María Paula! Now what? I'm not getting married, Mom. I don't love him. I want love, I want a family, I want children. Okay. Stop talking nonsense. You're getting married, period. You heard her, Amelia. She said she's not getting married. I'm not interested in this. Money, society... First you let this trash talk to me like that, and now you? Homie, I'm here! But I don't know what for. This "trash"... is my sister. We are siblings? God, no, my daughter definitely lost her mind. Mom, please, don't embarrass yourself. You know perfectly well this is Paulina. Dad's other daughter. Let's go, please. You can't leave Antonio. Watch me. No! María Paula! María Paula, don't! María...! Go back, if you don't want this to turn into a nightmare. Here... I don't want this life anymore. And Tony, let me give you some advice. Be who you really are. Come out of the closet, be happy! You deserve that, too! You have no idea what you just did! You're going to regret this! Globally! Félix, let's go! - Your sister? - Yes! - Great global embarrassment! - Guards! Don't even follow her! Let her get kidnapped! Tony! - I'll fix this, I swear! - Don't "Tony" me! Come on! Please don't leave me, Tony! Tony, please don't leave me! I'll fix this! I'll fix this, Tony! I can't believe it! A runaway bride! You left Tony at the altar! Tony! I can't believe it! It's life or death! It will only take five minutes. Please! Félix, stop! I do have an invitation, but I left it at home! Babe! So, I'm not late. It was me who took too long. You and I, always. Bravo! Bye. Hey! Hands off! Bye, babe, I love you. - Bye. - Bye, guys! - Bye! - Have a great time! Have a great game! Bye! Okay. You first. No! You go first. Okay... - They're girls! - Oh, my God! Awesome!
