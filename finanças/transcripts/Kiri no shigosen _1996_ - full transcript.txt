TOEI COMPANY, LTD. Presents 31 inches of the small intestine was removed. The surgery was successful, but... But? Does she have any family members? She has no family. Hakodate Yae with Crohn's disease moved to my town, Hakodate, from Tokyo the year after her second surgery. Yae. Yae and I have been friends since college. Kiyo, thanks for coming all the way. I was here for the news coverage. Welcome to my town. I owe you. We met at a special time in our lives and shared the same dreams and secrets. We're best friends. She'll live in a house on a hill in the nearby town. She's a lonely and strong person. We'll be living near each other. Just like we did in the past. Meridian in the Mist IWASHITA Shima YOSHINAGA Sayuri TAMAKI Koji YAMAMOTO Koshi HAYASHI Ryuzo Directed y DEME Masanobu Mitsuo. What are you doing here? Nothing. Mind your own business! Have you worked for a TV station before? I remember you. You were an anchor for a morning news. It was long ago. Before I knew it, I was more interested in doing paper craft art for my bread and butter. How nice! Mitsuo. You know that beautiful woman? She's my mom's friend. I see. Didn't you want something? Nothing. It's just... Just what? Never mind. Stop being nosy. Don't talk like a mom and stop being annoying. Quit following me. Good job. Thank you. Kiyo. What's wrong? Aren't you done? I don't understand why I'm assigned to write about the idea of sewing sweet chestnuts. The office is pulling my chain. It's an abuse to assign a divorced man to write about how best chestnuts can be sewed. He has a mean bone. Only someone like that could train an exceptional reporter like Kiyo. Kosuke. It's about time that you get out of your comfort zone. The reporters in the Cultural Affairs Department have to multi-task like the convenient stores. Learn from Kiyo. Once you learn the ropes, this kind of article is easy to write. For instance... Hold on. I'll give it a go. I want to see you tonight. How's this? Not good at all. Oh no, he's not home yet. He probably won't show up. I see. Oh dear, he initiated your welcome party. Recently, he's been rebellious. Did you have an argument? He asked me. Asked what? About his father. He thinks that he's dead, right? He heard otherwise. I'm not sure why, but he was furious and demanded that I tell him the truth. I see. Did you tell him? I refused to say anything about that time. I know that you understand. You promised to go. Don't drag your feet. I feel bad for Yae, but I don't want to see my mom. Why don't you ask Yae about your dad? Even if she knows, she won't tell me. Why? I bet my mom tied Yae's tongue. Damn it! Get out. I'll take care of it. Never mind. I can repair it. You're the only one who knows about my past. Mitsuo is well aware of that. So if he begins to stress out about it, he'll probably pester you with questions. I hope not. I don't want to talk about it either. What shall I do? You need to tell him one day. The truth? Yes. No way. I refuse to. Others will never understand. Only you and I. Don't you agree? I do. That's why... What do I do? Kuma, can I have another one? Sure. Is she your friend? She's not local, is she? No, I'm not. We've been friends since college. A long 20 years have passed. It's unusual. What? Men's friendship is one thing, but women's friendships don't last that long. That's true. It lasted probably because neither of us got married. Why didn't you get married, Yae? What about you, Kiyo? I wonder why. I never met Mr. Right. I'm on the same page. What a nice breeze! Are you okay? Drinking isn't good for you. I'm fine. I didn't drink that much. But you're waddling. Am I? Since I had drinks with you, I was relaxed. I must be depending on you. You can depend on me anytime. Doesn't spending time together like this bring back memories? What? The time of the demonstration. I was always on your left. That's right. My left arm and your right arm were our strengths so we helped each other. We swore to be the clinging crabs. Militant security! Win the flight! He was always in front of us. We were gazing at his back. Here you go. I'm sorry for not showing up. I had an argument with my mom. Don't worry. You're here now. Mitsuo, you've grown up. It's been a while. Mitsuo, tell me about your life. What life? School and a girlfriend... Do you have one? By the way... What? Do I look like my dad? I bet you know about my dad. Please tell me. Even if I do, I'm not in the position to talk about it. Kiyo can... Mom only tells lies. Don't say that. I understand your frustration wanting to know now, but she's not ready yet. She needs time. Can you give her some more time till she's ready? It'll be soon. I know you can wait. I'm sorry. I barged in this late and confronted you. I'm an idiot. Are you leaving? It's late. Okay. Come again. I want to see you. I might he too old for you to hang around. You're not old. Not at all. Yae, you're beautiful. Kiyo, can you get a story on the show at the Youth Center? Sure. It's too big of a job for one person. Let's see who has time. Kosuke. Man, Chief is really annoying. He always scolds us like that everyday. You made a long yawn in front of him. Anyone would scold you when he sees it. We have some spare time. Can we make a side trip? A side trip...? That sounds nice. Is the motel over there acceptable? You joker. As expected... Yae. I got this book you wanted. Really? Thank you. It's hard to get. Someone I know helped me. What were you doing? I was renovating the floor for my dye work. Dye work? I'm going to dye papers. I'll create the colors I want. We're on our way to cover a story. Kosuke. This is Kosuke, a junior crew member in the Cultural Affairs Department. I'm Kosuke. You're clumsy. I'm sorry. Can you find it? I'm Kosuke. Nice to meet you. I'm Yae. She's my good friend from college. She writes about paper craft art. Paper craft art? Sounds interesting. She's a known artist and held some exhibitions. Interview her for coverage in the near future, Takao. I'd love to. Absolutely not. Quit it, Kiyo. Why not? Market yourself. Kosuke, can you take our picture? Sure. In this? Kosuke is great. He's like a pro. I was stunned. What? I mean Yae. Yae? You had told me about her and I had someone else in mind. What do you mean, someone else? You said that she was in the demonstration with you. So I had imagined of someone more hard-core. I can't picture her holding a demo stick. You mean you can picture me? Yeah, if it's you, I can see that. Sure, I'm hard like a rice cracker. But, it's delicious. I like the texture of rice crackers. You're polishing an apple. I know that you like sweet strawberry cake. A sweat cake isn't as exciting. I was dying to see you. You seem absent-minded. I was thinking about Yae. I felt sad Knowing that Yae has nobody. She has you, a great friend. I'm not confident about supporting her. What do you mean? Yae is a patient with Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease? They're great Photos, aren't they? Yes, they are. He seems like a gentleman. The one you like. Who? Kosuke. Don't try to hide it. I've known you long enough so I knew it right away. Are you serious? Yes. How long have you been dating? Out with it! You're too wise for me. For about a year. His wife eloped. Wow. Is this for real? It's common, and that boy... That boy? Stop teasing. Sorry- He's kind of an air-head. I guess. A typical man gets drunk and rough but instead, he has become spacy. Even at work, he just looks out the window with his stany-eyed look. You couldn't leave him alone, huh? My motherly instinct kicked in and the. Rest is history. I'm done. Are you done? That's it? I won't go further. I gave you enough information. To make it fair, tell me about your life. Me? I broke up two years ago. I had two surgeries and I told my scars that this was more than enough. That's all. You should've slowed down. Are you okay? Do you feel nauseous? Hold on. I must look disgraceful. Your face, body... and your scar... This scar is an important part of you. You'll find someone who agrees with me. I... What? I'd rather have a child than a man. I want to bear a child like Mitsuo. Kawashima. So, what's up? Your mom? Yep. She's beautiful. Do you think so? We call someone like Yae beautiful. You revere her. She's much older. You're weird. I never said that I revered her. You're a weirdo. Is it because I'm not a virgin? That's not it. It's because of what you said. I wanted you to know about it. Don't you get it? I do get it. I'm leaving. You're just a kid! Stop it. Slop! I'm home. Who is she? Is she your girlfriend? Nope. Then who is she? She's nobody. I'll be out. To where? My friend's house. Are you studying for an exam? I am. Have you decided on the university? Not yet. Are you applying to the one in Tokyo? I just said that I haven't decided. I don't know why you're upset. Why don't you confess about my dad? Thanks for waiting. A large sweet bean custard. This is the Cultural Affairs Department. Kiyo is out of the office. Yae? It's me, Takao. Hi, Takao. A large sweet bean custard... How embarrassing! I got busted! I'll call back later. Okay. By the way Kiyo said that you would publish a book about paper craft art. Yes. I don't think it'll sell, but the publisher insisted. Can I interview you? Yes, I'm listening. Takao can interview you. It'll be a great advertisement. I'll be in Tokyo for business. When I return, let's all go for a drink. Call me and take care. Ando, I'm looking for seminar materials to take to Tokyo. Takao probably has them. Oh. What a mess! This is the Akane plant. It's been used for red-dye since the Nara Period. We slice its stem and simmer it. What kind of color does it tum to? All kinds of colors like bright red, pink, reddish violet and bordeaux. I don't quite get it. Even colorless and invisible things like grass has a right to express itself. I find joy in bringing out the best of life in colors. What's your favorite color? I like blue. What's yours? White? No. It's red, a burning hot red. It's about to rain. I'll get going. I had a great day. I'm afraid that you can't write anything good from my simple story. Of course I can. If I don't, Kiyo will kill me. Hold on. I'll get you an umbrella. Thank you. What's wrong? I have a stomachache. But I'm fine. It'll go away. You'd better go for a checkup. You know about my illness? I heard it from Kiyo. I see. Kiyo told you. Yae? I'm fine. Please don't worry. It's nothing. Please go home. Kiyo? Yes? I knew it was you. I'm Miyamoto. Remember me? I was Shinichiro's friend. I remember you. It's been a while. Almost 20 years. That's right. I struggled after college, but I managed to get into a small company. See you later. Okay. Nice to meet you again. Rumors have it that you're a single mother. Something like that. Do you know what Shinichiro does? I have no idea. He lives in Norway. His address is... I'll be late for my flight, so excuse me. How's Yae? You were best friends. The three of you were always together and I was curious. Shinichiro tested me. He asked if he could sleep with you. And, what did you say? I told him that he could. Why? Something is wrong. He's your boyfriend. But I have no right to tie him down. And, no one owns anyone. Don't you love him? Of course I do, but... But what? I know you love him, too. Welcome home. I'm back. Some coffee? No thanks. Did Yae call? No, she didn't. Oh, okay- Hello. I'm unavailable to take your call. Hi, it's me. I'm back from Tokyo. How was the interview? I hope he did well. Let's all three of us go for a drink! Call me. Talk to you later. Yae wasn't home? That's strange. She's usually home around this time. Do you talk to her? Sometimes. She calls me, too. We talk a lot. I didn't know. My mother is an extremely busy professional. This is Kosuke. I'm unavailable. Please leave a message. It can't be. October 21, 1968 Shinjuku Station. We had an urge to ruin everything. And, we thought that taking action was the only way to create our future. Shinichiro. Shinichiro. Yae. Shinichiro. Shinichiro. Yae got caught. Yae got caught. You're bleeding. You are, too. I feel bad for Yae. You expected this to happen. I knew that this day would come. Anyone wants to feel warmth of others' body. Please hold me. Kosuke, you're late. I'm sorry. Takao? As for your coverage from yesterday... Cologne. What? Nothing. How was the interview? She taught me everything from crafting the paper to dyeing. I'll have my article ready when her book is published. That's a good idea. I'll do my best. Kimura, any new information? I called your office and heard that you were out sick. I have a low-grade fever, but I'm fine. Are you feeling okay? I'm a bit tired I walked up a mountain with Takao yesterday to explain about plant dyeing. And, I went for a drink with my publishing agent. That's probably why. I'll get some tea. Don't worry. I'm going soon. Do I smell like cigarette? Not really. I was writing and chain-smoked. I'll be out for a business dinner with big shot in government. Can I use your cologne? Sure. Thanks. You're back. What's the matter? I dropped by on my way home. Do you want to come in? I just stopped by Yae's house. She was very happy- That's good. Do a great job. Yae is my best friend. Kiyo? What? When can you see me next? Can you? What? I'll call you. You'll get a promotion? It's still inside information I heard yesterday and it won't happen till next year. I'm very happy and proud of you. All your hard work will have paid off. Yes. I was running around like a madman. What about you? How's your book? Good. I worked on the layout. They look great. I also want to include pages with large photos that express myself unlike before. Can you take a look? I look forward to it. I'll stop by again. Do you have to go? I have to work. It's Sunday, but the newspaper company owns us. I'm sorry to rush out. Don't worry. I'm the one who asked you out. Cologne? What? You changed your cologne. Yup, the same one as yours. I'll be going. See you. Don't speak while we're in this room. Just love me. I was dying to see you. I wanted you badly. How terrible! You can't deceive the experts. How unprofessional! Tell them that! See you. Take care. I'm scared. I have a bad feeling. What? Something bad will happen. I'm here for you. Do you want me to spend the night? Please leave. The more time I spend with you, the harder it gets to be alone. So please go. You scared me! What are you doing? You ranked in the top three in the exam? I heard that you were at Yae's house and you make an occasional visit? Why didn't you tell me? It's not a secret or anything. You tell Yae everything instead of me. Why? I'm your mother. Why don't you tell me about your test and college admission? Yae is easy to talk to. Why? Do you like Yae more than your own mother? Exactly. Yae is gentle unlike you. I feel comfortable when I'm with her. What do you think? It's okay. Tell me. It seems too simple. I'll add red there. Red? Yes, this red. How beautiful! I like it, too. I finally managed to get this to the color I wanted. I see. You'll add it there. That's right. This red represents life. Life? It represents all future lives. Do you have a fever? A little bit. For how long? About a week. Did you get tested? Yes. Occult blood test shows positive three. Is that bad? It's not good, but... I don't feel like it'll get worse. Recently, I feel like I'll get better or even make a complete recovery. I may be dreaming, but I have a strong feeling about it. I wonder why. Stop making that face. It won't do you any good. Kiyo. I don't like that. Stop it. I don't like it. Kiyo. Kiyo. I can't do it. Are you chickening out? I have nothing to do with this. You're on your own. I'm out of here. You're Yae's... What can I do for you? That guy... I said that I'd beat up an irresponsible adult and he followed me all the way. And when it was time, he dogged out. Am I the irresponsible adult you mentioned? You're sneaky. Tell me why you punched me. I know that you are dating my mom. And that's not the issue. It's about Yae. You're dating my mom and Yae. You're the lowest being. You're an insult! Both my mom and Yae. That's insulting! Damn you. You're the worst. Do you feel better now? If not, continue. Are you messing with me, too? Not at all. I deserve this. I'm the foolish one. I don't know what to do with this situation. I'm sorry. Oh, no. What happened? Nothing. Did you get into a fight? With who? Do I need to answer? I'm wonted. You are not the type to get involved in a fight. You know nothing about me, so don't be so judgmental. I think I know enough about you. I'm sure you do. At least you know who my father is. I don't know about him. I can't even imagine what kind of man he might be. You have no idea how hard it's been for me. Do you? Mitsuo. Is my dad that bad that you can't even talk about him? Is he pretending that he doesn't know about me? Tell me! Does he even know that I exist? Say something. He knows nothing about you. I see. He doesn't know. Mitsuo. Don't touch me. You're selfish. No wonder you think you can keep a secret from my dad and I forever. You're ridiculous. You gave birth to me selfishly. Get real! Wait, Mitsuo. Where are you going? Who is it? Mitsuo? What happened to your hand? I punched hard. Who? Kosuke. Why? I saw him leaving this house. Don't do this. You can't date that jerk. Stop it. Let go of me, Mitsuo. I won't. I'm not a kid. I can sleep with you just like he can. Please stop. Mitsuo, please. I won't. I love you so much, Yae. Mitsuo, stop. I need to show you something. Can you tum off the light? Mitsuo. You know about my illness. I want you to see this. Look closely. This was opened twice. There'll be another one. You can feel it. I only wished that this scar was for bearing a child. I wished that a boy like you could come out of this scar. Awaji Shinichiro. Just stay there and listen. He was a medical student. We all participated in the demonstration. Kiyo and Shinichiro were in love. He loved her to death and disappeared. Disappeared? Yes, he'd gone away. We wished we did, too. We were carried away and one clay realized that we had nowhere to tum to. He was in despair as everyone else was in those days. He didn't know about her pregnancy. And? That was it. What kind of person was he? Do I look like him? You do. I'm sorry. Asama Sanso Incident Winter, 1972 We thought we knew what we got ourselves into end where we were going. Coalition Red Anny Lynch Incident. But after a while, we didn't even know what we were looking for. What got into me? Do I have to choose one of you? Can you do that? You don't have to. Don't talk in such a soothing voice. It's making me the only bad guy here. It's no one's fault. We're in this together. Hello? Stay as long as you like. You can leave this key in the mailbox when you leave. I consider you my son, brother and even lover. You know everything about Kosuke. But please look the other way. It won't last for long. Everything will come to an end soon. So please forgive me. Yae, what do I do? Mitsuo didn't return. We had an argument about his father yesterday. Yae, please answer. Please, Yae. Mom? Mitsuo, is it you? Yes. I stayed over last night and I heard... About what? About my dad, Awaji Shinichiro. What did she tell you? I won't. Forgive her for this. Let me see Yae. Now! Don't worry about me. But you should worry about Yae. She won't live for long. Does it hurt? I understand how Mitsuo feels. I deserve this for my behavior. Kiyo and you know everything but you don't tell me anything. I'm like a child lost to both of you. Someone we once knew said the same. He was Mitsuo's father and my lover. And he had also become Kiyo's man. Although it was brief, the three of us actually lived together. And? It was a rainy day. He borrowed my red umbrella. And he never returned home. I don't get it. You go for the same man. Were you okay with that? Are you okay now? Of course not. I can't stand the fact that we love the same man. I loved him and I love you. I suffered and I'm suffering. But since we're each other's competitors, even if we want to hate... Well, we probably did. She probably hates me. Help me. I can't stop myself. Don't worry. Say anything you want. I'm here for you. Even if ifs for a short time... just for today, let me be the only one in your world. Your back, arms and hands... I want to own every part of you. No, Mom. It means the world to Yae. You have me. I'm your child. Mitsuo. I wish I could heal your illness. You already did. You made love to me so much... When I close my eyes, I feel you right here. I love you. Thank you, Kosuke. I'm going to Norway. I decided to meet him for Mitsuo's sake as well. I got his address from Miyamoto who I saw not too long ago. I don't know if I'll get to meet him. I'm kind of scared. Yae, love Kosuke to death. Don't hesitate. You love each other. Embrace yourself. We each lived out lives to the fullest. Bergen City, Norway We each lived out lives to the fullest. But you truly enriched my life. If I get to see him, I'll talk to him about you. Nicholas, wear this! I'm fine. We'll get Daddy. Daddy, meal time! Hum!- You came all the way. It's my boat Please join me. I headed to Tanzania and let my destiny take its path. I arrived at this town, Bergen. Once I got very ill and battled against it. During that time, Anna, my wife, took care of me. Are you cold? I'm okay. You look taller. I grew a little bit alter I gave birth... to your child. It's a boy named Mitsuo. When I found out about my pregnancy after you had gone, I considered abortion. But Yae was against it. Yae? She begged me to give birth as that baby was the only thing left for us. And she even earned some cash to support me. WhY did you? I probably had the same idea as Yae. I must have wanted to keep something tangible from that era. I was carried away. I left Japan wanting to continue my flight and ended up dogging out... Thank you for having my baby. Kiyo. I thought you'd refuse to see me. Don't be silly. Come near the fireplace. You must be cold. Warm up. Kosuke made me happy everyday. He gave me a reason to live. But it's all over. We broke up. You can't do that. I told you not to worry about me. I don't want him to see me ill and see the new scar. I can't take it anymore. People must part. It's a matter of time. You're being silly. A new chapter of your life is about to begin. Don't leave me all alone. To be honest, I once hated you for taking both Kosuke and Mitsuo away from me. But I'm convinced that I need you in my life. I've lived my life with you and I will continue to... Thank you for coming. I'm really sorry. I'll visit Shinichiro tomorrow. Would you come with me? Of course. I go left and you go right. You have a fever. It's because of the wine I had. Take it easy. I'm fine. Let's dance! I wanted to have a baby. If you continue to live, you will. You can have two or three. Three is too many. How about having triplets? Killing two birds with one stone. With one stone? I'm fine. I'll get you a drink. Stay here. Yae. Hang on. Don't leave me all alone. I will have a baby. So... I can't die... You're right. You shouldn't. Kiyo... Hold me... Remember those days? I was always on the left side during demonstration. We promised not to part from each other.
