You're in the wrong alley. This is my place. - Leave me alone. - I'll leave you alone once you pay the tax. - That's mine! - Damn it... Hey! You want it? Come and get it. Yeah, that's what I thought. [a skate's approaching] - Hey! I know you. It's Freddy, right? - This ain't your business, bitch. - I'm terrified. You can totally tell, can't you? Here's the deal. I'm about to start making a lot of ugly noise. And I bet the cops parked around the corner are gonna know why. So... If I were you, I'd bounce before they get here. Then again, I'm not you. You OK, kid? - Yeah... - Listen, that guy's a punk. A spare changer, but he holds a grudge. You should steer clear for a while. - I'm gonna find him and beat his ass. - There's a plan. Or I can buy us some burgers instead. Your call. Alright, killer. Let's eat. Life's change fast. I've spent my 16th birthday in a dumpster. - How old are you now? - Seventeen. I got lucky last year. I met some great people. Got me off the streets. They can help you too. - I don't wanna any help. You wanted that burger. How long it's been since you ate? Two? Three days? You look about 13. What's your name? - James. Fourteen. - Over the hill, huh? - As you. - I'm Taylor. Did you... run away from a group home? That's what I did. My dad... died. So I got put in a bad place. No one wanted to adopt me, so I walked. So I was sleeping in abandoned buildings. This is one of my favorite. - Why are you telling me all that? - I want you to know you're not alone. - Thanks... But yes. - Do you have anyone? Mom? Dad? - No. - James, let me help you. I'll give you my address just in case you get yourself into more trouble. - Thank you so much. You can talk to Dray and he'll give you a receipt for your donation, OK? Thank you. Larry? - Yeah! - Hi, sweetie! Look, we've got some donations. Blankets. Your social media campaign worked. [laughter] Hey, can I grab Allison for a moment, sweetheart? - Yeah. So, we had 4 new arrivals that came in at 7. - Okay. - But they haven't been checked in yet. So, I think we have enough beds; maybe you should take one or two cots out from the back. - Hmm. - Do you think you can do that? - Yeah, no problem, Sandy. - OK, thank you. So, how's everybody's doing? Are you all getting enough to eat? - It's great! - Okay! - Mom. - Hey, Taylor. And who is this? - You said you didn't have a mom. - I didn't then. But I do now. Sandy and Larry adopted me. - Who's Larry? - I guess that would be me. Who's this tough guy? - His name's James. I found him dumpster diving over by the skatepark. - Hmm. That's a tough neighbourhood. Well, James, how do you feel about a bowl of my famous veggie stew? - How about it? Still hungry? - Yeah... - Alright, let's get you fixed up. Come on. - Oh... I'll give him a space tonight. - He could always stay with us. - I think we'll be alright. You can't save everyone. - I can try. - What is this place anyway? - You've never been to a shelter? - No. - Well, a long time ago, this is... this is what they used to call a social club. My wife Sandy and I, we got a good lease on the building and we turned it into a shelter. It's mostly for young people. But... our kitchen is opened to anyone who needs a hot meal. You know, that's how we met Taylor. - She's cool. I like her. - Yeah, Taylor's the best. - Why do you help kids? Why do you care? - 'Cause I do. - I hope Larry's okay. He's never very good at multitasking. He's just on until midnight. Miles will be here soon. - Yeah, but Miles usually just works the day shifts. - You know, sometimes I think you worry out loud just to hear your own voice. - Smarty pants. You wanna drive? [laughter] [groaning] - Let's go now, let's go tonight! - Where are we gonna go? Hmm? Where are we gonna go? - I don't know. We'll figure it out when we get there. - Yeah... Yeah, that's a hell of a plan, buddy. Ronny, I'm... I'm sorry, I can't. We can't. We can't leave grandmother alone. - She will be sorry, Ronny. She will be sorry. And anyone else who loves her. I promise you. I promise you, baby. I promise you. - I'm leaving, grandmother. I have to get ready for tonight. [rock music] - Hold on the fort, I'm gonna make a bank run. - Those boys are getting nasty again. I told them to cool it, but you might want to crack some skulls before you leave. - Morons... I'll deal with it. - Hey! First time here? - Yeah, I heard this was the place to throw down. - You heard right. We keep it old-school. - I like old-school. You know what they say about history: if you don't respect it... - You're going to repeat it. - Smart and pretty. I think I'm in trouble. - Only if you're looking for trouble. There's a new vert section over by the stairs. You should check it out. - Alright. Thanks! Well... You should drop by sometime, show me a move or two. - Your name's Clu? C-L-U? Like Clu Gulager from Return of the Living Dead? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. My dad was a big fan. - That movie was sick. - Hell yeah. Well I do... hope to see you around. Sometime. Soon. - Well... That happened. - Hey, baby! - Hi! We're late for the staff meeting. Get changed. - Well, I had to treat our girl with some fine afterwork cuisine. - Haha! You mean grease burgers. Did you find out any information about James today? - No... Social services came by. They're looking into a foster home for him. Nothing we can do. I'm sorry, honey, I know you like him, but they're some rules. - Well the rules suck. - I Know. - I forgot the county request form for Allison. - Well, they say that memory's the second thing to go. - Oh, you're in trouble later. - If you remember later. - I'll be right back. - Just be quiet when you go in because Taylor might be asleep. - OK. Hey! Aaah! - Dad! [cry of pain] - Honey? Honey! [moaning] 75250 Crest Lane! - Honey? - My dad has been shot! Send an ambulance now! - Oh my God! - He's still alive! Please hold on! Please hold on! - Larry! Larry, sweetheart! Sweetie, hang in there, honey! Hang in there! What happened? What happened? - I don't know! - Mom... Is he okay? - The surgery went well... That's the good news. - What's the bad news? - Hum... The bullet shattered his leg beneath the knee. So... he's gonna be okay... It's just gonna be a long recovery process. - I thought he was going to die. - I know. It's okay. He's gonna be alright. And they said that we'll be able to see him this evening. OK? He's pretty out of it right now. Okay? - Ms. Stewart? - Yes. - Detective Nick Salzner. I was just at your house. Do you think I can ask you and your daughter a few questions? - Of course! - You found something? - Yeah, but other than this, the assailant got away clean. No fibers, no fingerprints... Taylor, look, I know you didn't get a good look at the man's face, but is there anything else you could give us? Height? Build, maybe? - I told the officer already... It was too dark. It all happened so fast. - Look at this. We found it in the hallway. - Oh my God! - It's not unusual, with this kind of home invasion crime. A burglar will enter a home then cuffs the occupant at gunpoint while they sack the place. - He was standing right outside my door. Could he have been there to get me? - Do you have any reason to believe that anyone would want to hurt you? Or abduct you? - Happy birthday, Ronny. - Pathetic boy... Just pathetic. Is this how you pay your brother back? On his own birthday? You fouled everything up just like you always do. - It wasn't my fault, grandma. She was supposed to be alone. - You always have an excuse, don't you? Just like your mother. - Please, don't talk about her that way. - The truth hurts, doesn't it? She never loved you. But I loved you. I loved both you and Ronny, when nobody else did. So why don't we just can the back talk? - Nobody saw my face. - But you left evidence at the scene, didn't you? What are you gonna do about that? - No, no, I was wearing gloves, they don't know anything. - Oh... Well, at least you did something right. - Look, the police are involved now and we'll have to lay low, but I promise I'll get her soon. Just, please, don't mock me. - Come here to me, child. Come here to me NOW! There is no justice in this world! The bad people get away with murder every single day. But we don't like that, do we? We won't let that happen. - No, grandma. - That girl Taylor is responsible for the death of your brother. It's just the two of us, now. Family. And if we don't honor our family, if we don't avenge our family, then we are nothing. - Yes, grandmother. - Hey, love... - Hi, beautiful. Well, I guess I blew the big save, huh? - Oh, Larry... - Hey... Why the long face? Somebody's dying? - I was... just thinking of the first time I ever saw you. - It was a hell of a night, right? - Oh... That girl, over there. That's the one from last week. - OK. - Hey! I'm Larry. Can I talk to her for a second? I think you met my wife Sandy last week. It's a... small world, right? - She wanted to help me. I guess I blew it, huh? - Well, you know what I always say? You can't win every time, but you won't lose forever. - I almost didn't understand what you were telling me that night. Now I do. And I've been so lucky. We're all so lucky now. - Yes, we are, Taylor. And we're gonna stay that way. - Yeah... - Hey! I heard what happened. Is your dad OK? - Yeah. He just got a long recovery ahead of him. Thanks for asking. You're sweet. - You're awesome. - Take it easy, wild man. I'll catch you around the galaxy. [rock music] Hey! You're waiting for someone? - Yeah! And she just showed up! [light chuckles] I've only been working here for 2 months and I already got stalkers. Nice. - Don't' worry, I'm the good kind. - You ripped today, dude. Where did you learn all that? - My brother. He was gonna go pro, but then decided being in the army was a better decision, so... - What about you? You're gonna go pro? - No! No! That's a whole other level. - It'd be pretty dope, though! Being paid to skate? I don't think I could tackle all the broken bones, though. - Right? So... what does the future hold for Taylor Stewart, huh? - I was thinking of going in the social work. And being a school teacher. Or a counsellor. I like kids. - Well, we are kids. - Something like that. Are you heading home, now? - Yeah, I was gonna catch the last bus home. Unless you wanted a cup of coffee? - I don't know, man. My stalker drinks lattes? - Oh, come on! Alright, how about ice cream? - Even worse. I hate ice cream. - So you've made a friend... - [Clu]: Water? - You know what I do like, though? Sushi. - I don't have a choice. I can't let him get in the way. - No, but... - Aaaaah! - Are you OK? - Yeah. My ankle... - Hey, man! Get out of the damn car! You almost killed us! Hey! What are you doing, you psycho! I said: Get out of the damn car right now! - Come on, come on... What are you doing? - Damn it! Hey! Psycho! [screeching tires] Get back here! It was like 5 times in the last 2 months that something like this has happened. Just little wannabe gangsters, man. It's... But I give you my word, it's none of the guys who's skating here. Those kids tend to leave before we close up. Most aren't even old enough to drive. - You okay? - I think my stalker probably just turned real, man. - The whole thing happened so fast, I didn't even get the license number. - Jon thinks it was some rando, but I keep thinking about the other night. I mean, a man came into our house with a gun. And now, this happens? - I know... It's awful. But I talked to detective Salzner. And they haven't come up with anything. He still thinks it's a robbery gone bad. - So what? Cops are always wrong about stuff. - Hey... I'm not blind to this situation, okay? We need to be careful. But I don't think you should be coming home from work unless you call a rideshare or... you have me come pick you up. And no more street skating for a while. - Fine. But what if someone is stalking me? Watching us - You have any old enemies? I mean, from when you were homeless and all. - I don't think so. Not real ones anyway. I mean, I ran with some rough guys, but I never did anything to piss them off. Kind of the opposite, really. - Taylor, I know you love Jon Riker, I've known him for a long time, he's great, but I don't know about you working at that place. - It's really not as bad as all that, Ms. Stewart. I mean, families bring their kids there. A few bad apples, but... there're bad apples everywhere, you know. - I just wanna keep Taylor safe. - For what it's worth, I think your mom's right. You should be careful. - I will. - Oh, and there's a horror marathon on tomorrow night... Could be fun. - Keeping me indoors? - I'll text you. - Thank you. - I'm just glad you weren't hurt. But you're right: it is a hell of a coincidence. Maybe we could do a little digging of our own. See if we can find something the cops missed. - Maybe. But Sandy wants me to leave it alone. And you need to take it easy. You just had surgery 3 days ago. - Oh, please... Three hours after surgery, they had me doing P.T. They say it stands for a physical therapy. Nah-ah. Pain, torture. - Well, you've had your pain and torture for today. [sighs] That most be so hard for you. - Yeah... It's kind of killing me just laying around like this. But I'm gonna be back on my feet before you know it. - I'm counting on it. [phone ringing] - [over PA]: Dr Nguyen, obstetric, Dr Nguyen. - It's Clu. You know what to do. [Beep!] - Hey, I was wondering if you could meet me later. I have something I wanna run by you. - [Taylor]: This whole thing is creepy. There's no way it could be a coincidence. - You said you don't have any enemies... - That I know of. - What about down at the shelter? I mean, I bet you get some screwed up people. - No one with a car. - I don't know, it's worth looking into. You guys keep any mug shots? - It's not a police station? - I don't know. But... yeah, my mom keeps photo albums of all the people who stayed there. We can look through them. And I was thinking you can ask around the neighbourhood. You know a lot of people. And I know some guys who can back us up if things get heavy. - Those drug guys? - How do you know about that? - Words get around - I'm not proud of it. One of the drug dealers down town, Joe, he kind of owes me one. - Why's that? - I was working for him one night and I almost got busted. Someone warned me that they had been watching our crew for a few months. They were looking for the guy in charge, which was Joe. I talked him out of going into a big meeting that everyone was going to. All of his dealer buddies went to prison. All except for him. - What about you? - I was off the street by then. - I still saw him once in a while. Said I saved his life. That coming from a man who destroyed hundreds of lives. How's that for irony? - Incredible. - Remember. You're my eyes and ears, boy. Don't fouled this up. Don't disgrace our family. Oh, crank! These eggs are cold. [sighs] - Hey, Allison. - Hi, Miles! You're here early. Sandy's already here, she wants to talk to you. OK, cool. I brought you something. - Hmm... Oh! Miles! You're so sweet! - I wouldn't forget your birthday. - You shouldn't have, thanks! - That's alright. - Allison, I... Oh, Miles! You're here! Oh, my gosh, the place is a wreck from last night. We had some drunks come in. Oh, and can you fix the water leak in the back? - Oh, yeah, sure, I'm on it. - Thank you. Allison's gonna be running out to the store, but she'll be back. And I'm picking up Larry at the hospital. - Oh... Larry's being released? - Oh... You know my big strong guy! Gotta get home and star kicking ass right away! - Yeah! Yeah, Larry's the man. Well, don't worry about anything here, I have it all under control. - Miles... What would I do without you? Thank you. - Sure. - Thanks! - Yeah, bye. - Take it easy, love. - Yeah. - The doctor said not to push yourself too hard. - What do doctors know? - Well, well, look who decided to join the real world. - Hey, you! Aren't you supposed to be at work? - Would I miss the triumphant return of Larry Stewart? - Oh yeah, call in the camera crews, we'll make a reality show. - Hahaha! Honey, can you help me with this stuff? I've got a car load. - No problem! - Be careful on those stairs, love. - Yeah! - Testing. Testing. Okay, grandmother, we have eyes and ears. [suspenseful music] - So you're only suppose to take one of these every 8 hours, OK? It's strong stuff. - Yeah, I think I could use one now. Oh, hell, no, we're not doing that. Walkers are for little old ladies. - Well, do us all a favour and be a little old lady for right now. You're not good to anyone if you break that leg again. - I don't think I can break the leg again; they put enough metal in there to build a battleship. - I gotta get to work. I'll get a rideshare. - Oh, I'll drive you. So long as you promise to behave while I'm gone. Because I don't want to come home and find you dead on the floor. - I'll do my best to keep breathing. - Bye, dad. - Bye, honey. - Bye, sweetie. - Bye. See you. - Ah... - "She said she loved me, then she took off and left me. I don't know who to ask for help. Nobody has ever helped me." God... Cripes... "The street is my home now. And I thought I found a new family and Taylor threw me away." Damn it! Damn it! - I understand the situation, but what are we supposed to do? Larry needs us at home right now; we can't just go running off playing detectives. We need to leave this to the police. - The police won't find anything. They're not looking in the right places. - What are the right places? - I just feel like... I don't know, maybe we need to be looking closer to home. Or my old home. - Taylor, look at me. Look at me. You can't go back to those people. Don't even think about asking Joe for help. Hey, you were lucky before and you got out. But if you start hanging around with them again, you can get into a lot of trouble. - Mom, come on, I do... - Promise me you won't do that. - Mom... - Promise. - Okay. I promise. And if you need a ride, just call me. Or get a rideshare. Remember, I want you coming home right away. - Okay. - Taylor, I see that look on your face... Do we have an understanding? - Don't worry. I'll come straight home. - Okay. Love you! - What's up, man? Hello, little lady. You don't have a shift today, what's up? - Yeah, I just had to make a little detour on the way to do something. - Can I help? - No, I think I need to do this on my own. See you tomorrow? - Okay. Be safe. - ♪♪ We're gonna be over, over, now ♪ ♪ We're gonna be over, over, now ♪ ♪ We're gonna beeeeee ♪ Straight at last ♪ We're gonna be over, over, now ♪ ♪ We're gonna be over, over, now ♪ ♪ We're gonna beeee ♪ Straight a last ♪ - I'll be damned! As I live and breathe, it's Taylor X. - It's Taylor S. now. You were a little hard to find this time. Is he home? - Maybe. Maybe not. He's been keeping it low profile these days. - I need to talk to him about something. It's important, D. Please. Hey, this is T. Enough about me, let's talk about you. [beep!] - Hey, you. Give me a call back. Damn... - As I wouldn't remember you. - That's what he just said. - Damn, girl! It's good to see you. Have a seat. You're here to talk business or what? - Sort of. - Hi! Can we do something for you? - Yeah, I'm looking for Taylor Stewart, any chance she came by today? I checked where she works, but she wasn't there. - No, she and her mom have been gone since this morning. - Ah... - Are you a friend of hers? - Yeah. Yeah, something like that. - We can ask Miles. He's been here all day. - Okay. - Hey, Miles? - Yeah? - Have you seen Taylor at all? - No, no, I don't think so. - Damn... Well, I guess I'll keep looking. Thanks, guys! - Yeah. - No problem, Clu. - Hey, how do you know my name? - I... I must have heard someone say it around here. Hmm, no. - You know what, it was Sandy. Sandy told me about you. You're Taylor's boyfriend, right? - Hum... Maybe. - Anyway, I got to get back to work, but it was nice meeting you. - Yeah, nice to meet you too. - Look, T., I do owe you one. And I'll never be able to pay that back. If it hadn't been for you, I'd be in a deep hole. - You're saying you can't help me? - I'm saying I don't know how to help you. - It's real simple. Someone from one of your old crews might have a reason to hurt me. Or my family. I need to find out why. - I could put some eyes on the street. We can keep a lookout. I can put some guys on you too. You know, body protection. - I can't have a bunch of gangbangers hovering over me. My mom would kill me if she even knew I was here. Thanks. I think I can look out for myself. - Sure you can. Until that punk runs back up on your house and kills your family. - Thanks, Joe. That makes me feel just great. - I'm just trying to make sure you're protected. You're my girl. - I was never your girl. I was your friend. - Fair enough. But I still owe you. So just sit tight cause I need to think about this. I'll come up with something. - Thanks, Joe. - Hey... What are friends for, baby girl? - Follow that car. Don't lose him. There's a big tip in it for you. [suspenseful music] Stop, stop, stop. Right here. Big tip, buddy. Thanks. Hey, man! The hell? Get out of the car! [click! click!] - Shh! Shh! Shh! I'm sorry... You shouldn't have come here. I'm sorry... Shh... shh... [groaning stops] I'm sorry, it wasn't supposed to be this way. But it has to be. Neither of us has a choice. - Did you take care of him? - Yes, grandmother. Nobody will find the body, I made sure of that. - Now, go upstairs, take a shower, get a nap; you have to be at the shelter in a few hours. We have to keep up appearances today. - What about tomorrow? - Tomorrow? Oh, it won't matter. - Miles? How's the leg? - It only hurts when I laugh. - Don't worry, my jokes are terrible. - Hey, take it easy with those, you'll pass out at P.T. - I wish... Sweetie, I'm taking Larry to his appointment in a few minutes; we could drop you off at work on the way. - No, it's okay. I'm not on until later. - Okay. You alright? - I got a weird text from Clu. I crash early last night, so I didn't see it until now. Said something about talking to Miles, that it didn't feel right. - What didn't feel right? - I don't know. Miles, I guess? I guess that he was strange. He said he'd have more information later. - You know what, you need to be careful, okay? Don't go anywhere without a ride. - Okay. - Hey, Jon! Have you seen Clu today? - No! I'll let you know if he gets in! - Damn it... [phone ringing] - Haven Shelter. - [Hi, Miles! It's Taylor.] I have a friend who said he talked to you yesterday... [Did he mention where he was going?] - Hum, I'm not sure. I mean, I talked to a lot of people yesterday, but none of them mentioned you. - [His name's Clu.] He might have been riding a skateboard. - Hum... No, it doesn't ring a bell. [sighs] - It's so weird. - [Yeah.] Yeah, I'm sorry, yesterday was nut, so I just don't remember. - Okay, thanks. Hey, Jon, do you mind if I knock off early tonight? - No, go ahead! - Thanks! - [Miles, whispering]: I'll see you tonight, Taylor. - Clu? Clu! [ringtone] - This is Clu. You know what to do. [beep!] - Damn it, Clu! Where the hell are you? It's already after 7. Call me back. Now. - Shh! Shh! - Drop it! Nah-ah, don't make me kill you, tough guy. [gunshot] [groaning] - D? D, get up! [panting] [gunshots] - Don't let him get away! - What are you doing here? - Joe told me to look after you. [police siren] - Oh, great... - Freeze! Both of you! Drop that weapon right now! Now! Down on your knees, hands behind your head. It's nice to see you on the street again, Danger. It's been a while. - Just read me my rights, lady. [cuffs clinking] [a door is locked] - Mom! - Taylor! Are you okay? I got you out as soon as I could. - I didn't shoot anybody. You know that, right? - Of course, I do. Let's get out of here. - You almost got yourself killed out there! - She didn't see my face. - Oh, shut up! You let her slip through your fingers twice! - Just stop yelling at me! - I dare you talk to me like that! I'm your grandmother! - We have done everything your way so far! Everything has gone wrong! From now on, I'm calling the shots! - Oh, don't make me laugh, little boy. You can't even call a bird. - You need me! You can't survive. You can't even get out of that wheelchair. - Well... So, we 're gonna forget about this little incident. But don't you dare raise your voice to me like that again. Ever. You're not too old to be punished! You understand, huh? - Yes, grandmother. - Hmm. You are right about one thing: we need to be more ruthless. And we will be. When the time is right. - You need to calm down, Taylor. This is big time trouble you're looking at. Don't you think I know that? The cops didn't see what really happened. Someone jumped me! And I know it's the same guy that shot you! - Even if we could prove that, you had a gun, Taylor! You were standing next to an armed felon. Do you really think the police are gonna believe you now? - I don't know! But I at least need you guys to believe me! - Okay, okay, stop. Both of you. This is getting us nowhere. Just take a breath. - This is a nightmare. - [Taylor]: I know it is. But I need you to listen. Someone is stalking me. Someone just tried to kill me. And I think I know who it is. - This is insanity! I can't believe I let you talked me into this. - I need you to thrust me, mom. [exhales] - Hey, Allison. - Hey, Sandy! We're having trouble again with that leak in the back. - Oh, is Miles in yet? - No, he's on the schedule, but he hasn't shown up. I tried his cell; he's not answering. - Okay, well, hum... I'll be in my office. Will you let me know when he gets in? - Sure thing. - Thank you. - This could all be a coincidence. We cannot jump to crazy conclusions here. - I know it sounds crazy, but Clu said he talked to Miles. And then he just disappeared. - It doesn't mean Miles did something to him. Listen to yourself, Taylor... - I've been thinking about this a lot. First, I get a text from Clu telling me that Miles doesn't feel right. Then, I get another text from his phone leading me into a trap. I got that text after I talked to Miles. - Look, Miles has been working here for 6 months. I hired him myself. He has never disappointed us. Have you ever started to think that maybe... well... Clu might not be all that he seems. Because you didn't see the man's face. - Clu would have never done that. - Oh, Taylor... You just met him. You hardly know him. - But it didn't feel like Clu. When he grabbed me, it didn't feel like him. - Okay... So, what do we do? Because, right now, all you're doing, is accusing someone with no real evidence. - I don't know. But we have to do something. And I think we should start with your star employee. Who hasn't even shown up to work today. - Okay. Come here. I have his home address. We'll find him, and we'll go over there and see what he has to say for himself. - Fine. Let's go. - Taylor knows we're onto her. It's only a matter of time before they start putting all the pieces together. [suspenseful music] - He said there's no one named Miles Lewis living here. He's never lived here. - He gave the shelter a false address. Maybe even a false name. And now he's M.I.A. We need to go to the police now. - Okay. But I'm gonna call Larry first. [phone ringing] - [Hey there! What's up?] - Well, it looks like Taylor might be right about Miles. He provided false information to the shelter and he didn't come in to work today. Do you think maybe you could look into him a little more deeply? - Yeah, I mean we have access to certain databases, but... beyond that, it's... You know what? Let me call in a favour or two. - [Great!] So Taylor and I are on our way to see detective Salzner now. - Good. Be safe, okay? - Yeah, you too. Love you. - All I gotta tell you, guys, is this is not good. For you and me. In this arrest report, you are literally holding a smoking gun in your hand, Miss Stewart. A stolen gun no less. - I already told you! I was trying... - No, I get it, but... you know what a judge is gonna get? It's not a pretty picture. - What? So we're just supposed to ignore the fact that she was lured to a place and attacked? Maybe by the same man who shot my husband? - That's your story and it might even makes sense But there's no concrete evidence to back it up. Now, what I can assure you, is that we're using everything in our power to investigate your husband's shooting. And we'll take all of this new information into account. But as for you, running around shooting at people like some damn vigilante, that ain't gonna happen. - I'm not a vigilante. And I didn't shoot anybody. What about my friend Clu? He's still missing. - I'll put you in touch with the missing persons department. But in any event, I recommend looking into getting a good lawyer. - Well, thank you, detective, I think we're done here. - Oh, I got you... - Hi, honey! How are you? - Baby, I'm like magnum P.I. Come here. You gotta see this. - What did you find? - Well... At first, it was a dead end. I mean, I'm not much of a hacker. But I called a friend of mine who is. She got on the case fast. Miles apparently covered his tracks pretty well. But not so well that he couldn't be tracked. I mean, look at this. Everything he gave us was fake. Last name, social security number... Everything. Stefanie had to track him with fingerprinting and photo records. His real name is Miles Dyson. He's gotta an arrest record, juvenile crimes mostly... Been in a therapy for years... Stephanie found some of those records too. - Dad, is there anything in his file about a family? A brother? - Hum... Yeah... Ronny Dyson. Committed suicide 9 months ago. He was 14. - [sobbing]: No... No! - What is it? What's wrong? - Everything. - [Taylor]: When I was still on the street, days and weeks blurred together. You ran with people a while and then they'd rolled or disappeared. You learn to make friends fast. - Hey, Taylor! Get anything good today? - I got us some dinner. - I love you, Taylor. You're my best friend. - He had so much need in him. He was so desperate to find a new family. I wanted to help him, so I did. - [Ronny]: I'm never going home. Not until my grandmother dies. She used to lock me in the basement. I was down there for 2 weeks once. - What about your brother? He's still there. You have to tell someone. - No one will believe me. If I tell, they'll just send me back with her. I wanna help my brother, but she controls him. She hurt him. Bad. Burned his hands... Beat him. She used to make me watch. He's so scared of her. He'll never say no to anything she says. You're my family now, Taylor. Promise me you'll never leave me. If I lose you, I'll die. - Don't say stuff like that. I'm here for you. Promise. - [Larry]: What happened then? - That next night, he didn't come back to the camp. And I almost got arrested and then I met you, guys, and I got off the street. I went back there to look for him a few times but he was never there. And now he's dead. He killed himself because I left. - Listen. This is not your fault. - But what if it was? That poor kid, that poor boy, he needed me. And now... - Taylor, stop. You are the strongest and most loving person I have ever met. But sometimes, you have to save yourself first. You're no good to anyone else if you're lost. And when we found you, you were lost. So whatever happened to that boy, it was not your fault. - What if someone else does think that? Someone who wants to make me pay for it. - Alright, we're going back to the police station tomorrow morning and we're gonna tell them everything that we know. This is not a coincidence. This is all connected. And they need to see that. Taylor... Hey, look at me. You're a good person. You didn't do anything wrong. And we will never let anything bad happen to you. Okay? - They'll be looking into you by now. They'll be finding out things. Everything is on the line. Don't ruin it. - I won't. I know how she thinks. She's all ours. [suspenseful music] - Try to get some sleep. We'll go see Salzner in the morning. He'll help us. - [crying]: No, he won't. - When he sees what we have, I think he will. I love you. - I love you too. If anything ever happens to you... - Oh, sweetheart... Nothing's gonna happen to me. We're all safe here. Larry's staying up all night watching out for us. Okay? Good night.

Miles Dyson! Miles, I came alone. It's me you want. Leave my family out of this! Miles, goddamn you! - Oh! It's just me! [exhales] - James, what are you doing here? I thought you were in a group home. - I was just looking for a place to sleep. I had to get out of that place. - I'm sorry about all that, James. - What are you doing back here? - I was looking for someone. Actually, I was hoping he was looking for me. - Have you got any food? - No... I got some money, though. I might be out here a while. - Hey... You need to get some sleep. - No... I need to stay awake. - Hmm... - These pills... I just... Maybe a cup of coffee? - Okay. I'll make some. - Thank you. - I love you. - I love you too. Sandy? Honey? - [Miles]: Hi, Larry. No, sit down. Don't! No. - Where's Sandy? - She's fine. Larry, I swear to you, I will kill you. That's what I'm supposed to do. But I won't. I won't do it if you just SIT DOWN! It was you, wasn't it? You shot me. - Yes. I'm sorry. This is all got so out of hand. I didn't want any of this to happen. But I promise you, I promise Sandy will be okay. I just... I can't have you following us or calling the police. Not right away at least. - Okay. [clinking] - Cuff yourself to the chair. Do it. I'll be taking this too. - You're digging yourself a deep hole, Miles. You do this... There's no way out. - Yeah, you're right about that, Larry. There isn't. Other side. [ringtone] - Hello? - Miles: [Hello, Taylor.] - Miles. [I knew it was you.] - You were very smart not to stay at home. - Then come and get me. I'll tell you right where I am. - I know right where you are. I'm not stupid. You have very powerful friends that are probably waiting out right now, aren't they? Waiting for me to bounce on you. - Not this time. It's just me. - Forgive me if I don't believe you. Our last meeting was less than pleasant. - What have you done with Clu? - Listen to me. You're gonna come to a certain place in exactly 30 minutes. No righteous, no police, toss your phone, come on foot. Tonight, I have covered all the bases. Believe me. And if you're even one second late, if I see that you have a phone or if there is anyone with you, it will end very badly for your mother. [beeping] - How can you even look me in the eyes, Miles? I helped you when you needed it. We were always there for you. Always. We were family. I don't believe that Taylor didn't mean anything to you, Miles. - Shut up, woman! I'm his family! Not you! - Miles... - I said shut up! Or I'm gonna have to gag you. So just behave! [groaning] [muffled cries] [phone ringing] - [Larry's voice]: Hi, this is the Stewart residence. If you can't reach us here, try the Haven Teen Shelter: 555-12... - Taylor? What's happening? - I need you to stay here. - Where are you going? - I can't tell you. But you'll be safe here for now. I can't put you in any more danger. - I don't care about that! I'm coming with you. I got your back! - No, James. Not tonight. Listen to me. I will always be your friend. But I knew a boy a lot like you a while back. And I didn't take care of him the way I should have. And it's all coming back on me now. I need you to understand that if I let you go with me, you could get hurt. Just stay here, okay? I need to go. I don't have much time. [grunts] [phone ringing] [groaning] [breathing heavily] - Ten minutes to go. - This is an eye for an eye, isn't it? You blame Taylor for the death of your grandson so now she's gonna take his place. - Oh... It's very perceptive. - She'll fight you. She'll never stay with you. - Oh yes, she will. Because I know something you'll never know. I know what it means to break the human will. I know how to punish. It's what I did with my whole family. After... 2 months, in the dark, starving, your daughter will be broken. She won't even remember your name. And then, one day, when she finally looks up into my eyes, and calls me mommy... When I see that she is finally mine forever... ...that's when I will slit her throat. [gasps] One minute to go. Hmm. I hope she doesn't cut it too close. - Miles, you can still stop. You don't need to do this. You don't have to be afraid of her. - Shut your mouth, whore! Gag her. - No, Miles, please. Please don't, Miles... Please, don't... You don't have to do this! No! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Sandy. - Don't talk to her. Look at me! Look at me! We have a promise to keep. You mustn't flinch. You haven't yet. This is the way of the world. 30 seconds. [Sandy's trying to talk] [whimpering] You're about to die, woman. Make your peace. - Oh God... I'm sorry. [knock! knock! knock!] - Oh! I love it when my children are on time. - Hey... Come in. She's clean. No phone. - You've been a good little girl. Sit down next to Sandy. Sit, child! Now, we haven't been properly introduced. My name is Marnie. I'm your new mother. - You're a crazy bitch. - Oh... [clicks her tongue] Sticks and stones. But you'll learn to respect me. This is my obedient one. He's my good soldier. Now, tell me, Taylor: how big is your heart? Would you lay down your life for this woman just because she decided to call herself mom? - I'm not playing any of your sick games. If you're gonna kill me, get on with it. Where's Clu? What have you done with him? - My grandson took care of your boyfriend. He was nosy. He has nobody to blame but himself. - We have to get out of here. We gotta do this fast. We're compromised. - Yes, of course, of course. My father was a prospector. He... hum... built a tiny house in the desert, in the middle of nowhere. An I... I dreaded going there as a child. But that's where we'll get to know each other much better. But... First things first. [groaning] [Knock! Knock! Knock!] [tries to yell] [Ding-dong!] [muffled cries] [muffled cries] [breaking glass] [muffled cries] - Aaah! God! Thank God you're here! How the hell did know where we lived? - Taylor told me when we first met. - Listen, I can't get loose. There's a telephone on the dining room table. Go ahead and get that. Okay... Dial 213-555-2161. Tell me when it answers. - You have 1... - It answered. - Okay, push 4. Hold it against my ear. - [Taylor]: Larry, God, I don't know if you'll get this, but you need to know what's going on. I'm going to where mom is. She's at 410 Parkwell Avenue. - Okay, good. Now, call 911. - This is for you, Taylor. This is a part of your education. Maybe even the biggest part. As your mother said, an eye for an eye. - Miles, I didn't kill him. I didn't kill Ronny! I loved him! I wanted to help him. I went back there looking for him, but he was gone! - Shut up! - He needed help! He was sick and you know, Miles! - I said shut up! - He told me about how she abused the both of you. Don't you see who the real monster is here?! - Kill her. Kill her now! Kill her mother! [gunshot] - Don't move! I'll kill you. I swear I'll do it! [chuckles] No, she's not gonna do it. She can't. She's nothing. She's nobody. Kill her, Miles. Take that gun away from her and kill her! What are you waiting for? She's nothing. She's not anyone. She's nothing! She's a snot nosed kid from the streets. She's not family. She's not blood. Obey me, Miles. Obey me now! Kill her! Kill her! What... What are you doing? Where are you going? - The hell with you. - No... I'm your grandmother! Miles! Miles... Miles! Miles... [police siren] - Oh, stop right there! Put your hands up, son, where I can see them. - [Sandy]: Okay, love. We'll be home soon. Bye. So Larry's okay, and so is James. They're with the police. - I thought I was going to lose you, mom. - Oh, sweetheart... [exhales] Never. - No. - I guess... - Well... Here we go. Wish us luck. - Hey! You sure you wanna do this? - I think I have to. I know what he did is awful, but... he needs help. You guys understand, right? - Of course! We're so proud of you. - Take it easy! - I will. - Doctor said you'll be out of the brace soon. - Don't worry about me. I'm an expert at baby steps. I could write a book about baby steps at this point. - Well, you know what I always say: Can't win every time, but you won't lose forever. - There you go. - Isn't that right? - [Larry]: Oh, look at you! - Ah, sweetie! You're gonna have so much fun. I'm gonna be there at 3:00 to pick you up, okay? - Hey, have fun. We'll see you this afternoon. - Okay. - Okay, bye. - What's wrong? - It's kinda scary going to school and all. - You'll learn by doing. You'll be fine. You ever think about it? Being on the street and all? - All the time. But I don't miss it. Do you? - I like being your big sister better. ♪♪♪ - What are you doing here? - It's a good question. My mom wanted to know that too. A lot of people think I should just write you off. - Maybe you should. - Your grandma was a monster. You didn't deserve to grow up like that. No one does. I can't forget what you did. But I really hope you get better in here. Find some way to turn your life around. I wanna help. I can. Everybody deserves a second chance, Miles. - After everything I did... why do you care? - Why not?
