And count the money. Not like before. Well, alright. I need a book for school. Can I have some money? Here. Everything comes from the earth. The baby won't stop crying. I don't know what's happening to her. Relax, babies are like that. Relax, take it easy. Aunt, change it, the remote doesn't work. What else do you want me to do for you? Get up, girl, and do something to help. This is last straw. Leave it, leave it! I'm watching. You're so annoying! Beatriz, where were you? Mother! I'm a grown up. Were have you been? Damn it!

If you don't like it, you can leave. - What do you have there? - My mom sent it to me. What's the big deal? You mother Isn't here. Yara, what did your mother send? Nothing. Your mother was going to send me money. She didn't send you anything. She's been crying for days. I don't know what's wrong with her. It's normal some babies cry a lot. She didn't give her the medicine. Maybe that's it but it's normal. Beatriz also cried a lot. Some babies cry a lot. It's full, Mr. Atillo. See you later. Ill. Cutie. You get more beautiful as time goes by. Those things your mother sends from Buenos Aires. I don't want you wearing them. You look like a girl from Buenos Aires. Go change, we'll leave later. Grandpa, look how pretty these clothes are - No. We're working here and we're not doing as you say. Do not tempt the devil. Crazy old man, I'm fed up with you! I am not a boy! Get by or your own! Hi. It's for Lara. I miss you so much. I bet you're all grown up. I hope you like the shirt I sent you. I want you to know that I'm pregnant. You're going to have a little brother. I can't visit you this year. Don't tell your grandfather. Here's my new number. So you can call me if you need anything. Study a lot and listen to your aunts. I miss you a lot Mom. You're finally having a boy. Congratulations. Can you call this number? Can you? - Of course, Mr. Atilio. Speak, now you can speak. Elena? Dd you get through? Will you pay later? No problem. Go get changed. Your bag's over there. Did you go through my stuff? Where is my mother's letter? I said where's my mother's letter! Damn it, Grandpa don't touch my things! This's wrong, Grandpa. We're moving away from home. Where are we going, Grandpa. To look for my grandson. Buenos Aires is far away. I know where it is. Far away, down the river. Get some rest. Grandpa, that engine doesn't work anymore. Let's go home. We'll talk to Mom, so she can pay for the bus. There's no time to go back. My grandson has to be born in Paraguay. I have to teach him to fish. Like my father taught me. But you're a woman, you'll never understand. Men were born to be on the river. I've been working with you since I was born. I can to it too. Men were born to be on the river! And women were born to stay at home! Now you remember that? She has nowhere to go, she'll be back. Beto, let's take a look at the engine. Where did you go? To the bedroom. Girls can't go standing up. Who gave you that? That guy. I told him I'd pay him later. Grandpa, are we already in Argentina? The river looks the same. And why do they speak our language. A long time ago this was Guaraní territory. Was Paraguay bigger? It was all one land. Then it was divided into countries. And everyone was screwed over. Could you repair the engine? That smart man is helping us. Come on. It cost $ 10,000 guaranís, Grandpa. How old are you? Fourteen years old. Why do they call your dad The Uruguayan? They call me The Uruguayan because I was in Uruguay. I came to work in Yacyreta as a teenager. There I met Beto's mother who is Paraguayan, like you. And then I couldn't go back. I want to make you an offer. You might like it. Translate. We know the engine is broken. But the boat good and it has some cargo. I'll buy it from you. That is more than enough for the bus to Buenos Aires. Yes, the bus! He can sell you the engine and the cargo, but not the boat. I'll keep the cargo. And take care of the boat until you come back from Buenos Aires. I'll give it back only if you bring me. We can close the deal tomorrow. Now let's have the barbecue. Not a bite all day. The only time my friend dropped the rod to have a sandwich, a fish dragged it off the boat. Three minutes later. I feel a bite. I looked at him and said: “here's your rod “. And he says... Come here! Dad! Let's get to bed, we're getting up early. I'll tell you something. There is a man at night we cannot see. We can't get distracted. We have to be very careful. You can't walk alone out there. The lord of the night has a name. But you can't say it. He gets very mad He doesn't want his name to be said. If you mention it, Or it, you whistle at night, he may show up. And he can hurt you! The Lord of the night is horrible, a perverse being. He has bad intentions. He becomes friends with some men. He can help you when you fish. But you must never get distracted. He is treacherous and very intelligent. Did you see him? From afar. Once. Standing on the bank of the river, he looked like a big otter. He stood up on two feet. And whelm I saw him better, the fish that were already clean and gutted, started turning over and jumped back into the water. And they swam away. The Lord of the night usually shows up to girls who are bad. And gets them pregnant. By resting his hairy hands on their bellies. That's why. You have to be good. Why are you doing that, Grandpa? I'm leaving this tobacco for the Lord of the night in case he comes by tonight. If you want go to bed, you can sleep in the fishermen's cabin. Where are you sleeping? Here in the tent I have to be near the bank. Let's go. What are we going to do now? Do you want a “chipa”? Thank You. Are you coming to see the Virgin? Where are you from? I've never seen you before. We're from Paraguay. We're going to Buenos Aires. Is he your grandfather? Your granddaughter is beautiful. Here. Pray to her, so you have a good trip. I don't know how to pray. You, don't? It's no science. No one taught me. Good morning! How did you sleep. Here, miss, sweet pastry. Here you go. Here, miss. Thank you, have a nice trip. A pastry. - Sir, sorry to brother you. - Thank you. Miss... Where did you come from? I'm not walking anymore! - What? - This is not travelling! I want to take the bus! Shut up! Do not talk to me like that. Learn to respect your elders. If we get to Buenos Aires, I'll leave you stranded there. Let's see how you get by. If you don't want to speak Spanish! As if you were a rock Old drunk! Come on. Come on! To Buenos Aires? Stay on this road a few miles, and you'll see a town. There's a train, it'll take you to Buenos Aires. Thank you. Sorry, mam, I didn't mean to brother you. What do you need? Is the train coming by? We need to go to Buenos Aires. It already came it'll be back in two days. Do you have any food? But we only have Paraguayan money. I'll see what I can do. A bathroom? Go ahead. Sorry to brother you. How will you buy train tickets it you only have Paraguayan money? I can exchange it for you. How much do you have? Grandpa. The money. Is that enough? Pato! Patrício! Come here, please. Do you know if they're hiring on the farm? You mean them? They should get ready I'll take them. They don't pay much but it'll be enough for the train. Do you have a phone. - Yes, don't worry. - Mom. - Yara! Don't spend your money, baby. Are you alright? I miss you very much. I miss you do, honey But I can't now, my dear. Go to Betty's house on Saturday and I'll call you there, ok. I have a lot of work and I'm behind. They're calling me now. I miss you, baby. I will call you on Saturday. Say hello to your grandfather and aunts. I miss you very much but I have to work now. I have to go, Iara. - Bye, baby. - I love, you too. - Bye. - Bye. Did you speak with her? She doesn't know we're coming. We're here, get out. Come on. Go to the storehouse. We'll talk to the foreman tomorrow. Go get some rest. - Good morning, Sir. - Hello, Patrício I brought you some people to work. Two oft them aren't from the area. Could you give them a hand for a couple of days? I have strong hands and I know how to work the land. The girl can help as well. Ok, but the girl gets paid half. Are you tired, Grandpa. It doesn't matter. You worked very well today, honey. All aboard! All aboard! Tickets! Your ticket. Thank you! Grandpa! I'm going to the bathroom. Why did you hit me? As if you were worried about me. You don't love me. You only love your grandson. Why do you care if he's born in Argentina? Blood doesn't know that countries were divided. Who carries the blood? I think women do. Because they give birth. In the end, we're more important. Without boys, you can't have children. And without women who gave birth to boys? If all the men leave Paraguay. How will the country grown? That's why the Lord of the night exists. Grandpa! What's the matter? Grandpa. What is it? Are you alright, Grandpa? Talk to me, please. Grandpa. I need... I need to rest, dear. Don't say that, you're very strong. You'll be alright. Rest here. I'll be right back. No! Tell him not to move. Grandpa. It's to make you feel better and help you walk. So you can get to Buenos Aires and see your grandson. You really are brave. Your grandfather doesn't speak Spanish. He never wanted to learn but he understands. - Will he get better? - Yes, don't worry. He was very dehydrated, but he will be fine with this. You're very dirty. Do you want to shower? I have clothes for you. And my grandfather. He'll be fine, it's ok. He needs to rest. Come on. Come on. Come with me. Have a cookie. Do you want a “mate”? Your shirt's very pretty. My mother gave it to me. Why didn't you wear it before? My grandfather doesn't want me to. Wait. Let's see. Why are you going to Buenos Aires? Because my mother is pregnant. You're going to have a little brother. Are you happy? I don't know. Everything will be fine. Let me see. You look very nice. Is Buenos Aires far away? Three hours. What did he say? That we have to go. Let's go, I say. No, he has to stay. Tell him he can't leave. He has to rest. - You have to rest... - Let's go! I'm the only one that goes to school. My aunt and cousin envy me for that. My mother told my cousin Beatriz to study, but she doesn't want to. And since she's not her daughter she can't force her. Do you like school? The teacher is very good to me and I have schoolmates. Yes, like to study. What would you like to be? I want to be a veterinarian. I love animals Cats and dogs. What do you do? - What did he say? - To stop bothering you. It's alright, sir I can use the company. I've been travelling long and I'm quite tired. And I'm fine, I'm not tired at all. I can see that. It's good to have a copilot like you. - Is your grandfather better? - Yes. He got dehydrated under the sun, but he's fine now. Where are you going? To Buenos Aires. Yes, I know, but were exactly? Do you have an address? A phone number, somebody to call? - I have my mother's number. - Buenos Aires is big. This is the number. Call her and ask what the address is. Is Elena there? I'm Yara, her daughter. I'm coming over with my grandfather. Can you give me the address? What can we do if mom doesn't want. You grandson to be born in Paraguay? Don't worry about it. What if she doesn't want to see me? - Hello, Mam. - Hello. Do you know which one is Elena's house? Elena who? 1755 Moreno St. Can I see? From the corner, three blocks down. I mean, tree houses. Tree houses. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Here it is, Grandpa. - Hello, is Elena here? - No. I'm Yara, her daughter. We spoke on the phone. How are you? Fine. Nice to meet you. Come in. Take whatever you need. From the fridge, use the bathroom. Or Elena's room is over there. Excuse me, but I have to go work. What time will my mother be here? Around 8 PM. You have my number. If you need anything, just call. The Lord of the night comes to young girls while they sleep, to remind them of the Guaraní blood they carry. If you see the lord of the night in your dreams don't forget to leave him tobacco in the house. As if l were a boy? The Lord of the night doesn't come to men. That's right. Does he want only women? And you, honey, you should behave yourself. You're from Paraguay. Wherever you are, you are Paraguayan.
