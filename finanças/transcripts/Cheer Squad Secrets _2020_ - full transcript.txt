(eerie music) Help! Amelie! Where are you? Where's my daughter? I said, where's my daughter? (soft music) (shower running) Scott? What's going on out there? I guess Amelie really wants that captain's slot on the cheerleading team. I've never seen her work so hard, or get out of bed so early. Speaking of bed... I don't know about you, but I've got work to do. Oh yeah? We'll see about that. Look I have to get ready, so, you either get breakfast, or-- Or? Save some room for dessert? Good morning, Amelie. -Honey, don't run by the pool. -It's fine. You don't want to break your legs before tryouts. It's fine. Okay, let's eat. I don't have time. Lisa's going to be here in like 10 minutes. I knew you'd be in a rush, which is why I made you a protein shake. You can take it with you. I just really don't want to be late. Coach Nina's tough, you know? -Who? -Dad, we talked about this. -Coach Nina. -Amelie's new coach, Scott. She used to be a professional cheerleader. Right, right. She kicked one of the girls off the team for just chewing gum. -Geez. -I just really don't want her to think that I'm not good enough. I was a cheerleader for a long time, and you're as good as anyone I've seen. Yeah, that was a long time ago, so things might have changed. (snorts) Even if it was a hundred years ago, some things don't change. Talent and hard work still count. (phone buzzes) I gotta go, Lisa's going to be here any second. -Don't forget this. -Okay, thanks. -Bye, guys. -Bye. Bye, honey. You really think she's going to drink that? No. (laughs) What are you laughing at now? How long ago were you a cheerleader? Don't forget I have got moves that you have never seen. -Wow. -Mmm-hmm. This is going to be a good day. (pop music on radio) Thanks again for letting me drive. No problem. You've had your learner's permit for like forever. Why doesn't your mom just let you practice with her? I don't know. She's always worried that I'm going to get hurt or something. She treats me like a child. Can you believe that Natasha's trying out for cheer? She's so fat that when we're running laps, you can hear her thighs squeak. Natasha isn't fat. I'm pretty sure I'm the same size as her. You said it, not me. Amelie, I see Ethan, pull over. (frustrated) Amelie, I see Ethan, pull over! This is my car, and I'm not supposed to pick up anyone. Lisa, don't be a drag. Ethan's car is in the shop and I told him we'd give him a ride. -Hey, Ethan. -Ethan. Hey, Ethan. Thanks for the ride, ladies. How are you doing, Lisa? Eh. How about you, Amelie? That's good, eyes on the road. No distractions, huh? [Tanya] Ethan, do you get your car back today? Yeah, I'm picking it up from the shop during lunch break. Could you give me a ride after school? Sure, whatever. Morning! (laughing) You nearly scared me to death. I'm sorry, I hope you didn't hurt yourself with that coffee. No, I'm fine. And more importantly, I didn't spill anything on the new stock. What brings you in so early? I was on the phone with our new supplier in Shanghai at three in the morning for two hours. Is everything all right? It is now. It was just some confusions over quantities, but once I had it all sorted out, I couldn't get back to sleep, so I figured I might as well come in early. After all, today's the big day. Big day? If you close the deal with Pickett Line Venture Capital, Sun Style is going to the big time. This is just the first meeting, don't crack open the champagne yet. Who needs a reason to drink? (whistle) That was rough. I didn't know a tryout could be so hard. I dropped the catch like three times. My arms feel like noodles. I'm never going to be as good as my mother. I can tell it was hard for you. I'm sure if you practiced more, maybe you'd be better. Thanks Tanya, how'd you do? Fantastic. I feel so good, I could do it all over again. Tanya, I need to talk to you. Can you come to my office now? Sure. I mean, I'm supposed to meet someone in-- It won't take long. Yes, Coach Nina... Do you think Tanya's in trouble? No, I think Coach Nina's probably going to make her captain. No way, you're so much better than her. My mom was captain. That's what I want to be. You're doing good work, Tanya. I've seen how much you've improved and how much stronger you're getting. Thank you, Coach Nina, I've-- But I don't want you to get arrogant. You've still got a long way to go. I know, I mean, I'm not-- Have you been working out? Doing the dumbbell exercises? Yeah, I've been doing-- Are you taking the supplements that I recommended? Well, the... If you want to be captain, I need you to be strong. Lean muscle mass is crucial. You only get very few chances in this life, Tanya. Do you know what I mean? I think so. You have a chance to do something great. To help take our team to the national championship. But if you lose that chance, you'll never get it back. I never got mine back, Tanya. Keep taking those, and keep working out. I won't let you down, Coach Nina. I know you won't. (soft music) [Young Nina] Thanks for giving me a ride home from practice, Coach Alvers. Oh, not a problem, Nina. You know how much I enjoy our time together, don't you? I guess... You should, you're a talented athlete. But you're also a well-rounded, smart, capable young woman. Thanks. It's true. You're physically strong, well-coordinated, and you have the smarts to know what it takes to win. Speaking of winning, have you thought about what we talked about last week? Yes, I've stepped up my workouts outside of practice. Especially my core exercises to five or six times a week, and doing homework all day Sunday. That's great, Nina. But I was actually thinking about something else. Something to make your practices and workouts more effective. You mean the... Now I found this in your locker. Oh. I gave these to you last week, which means they should be empty by now. But that's not really getting with the program, now is it? I'm sorry. It's just I've read things about these pills and the things they can do. Especially to girls. They make you stronger, yes, but-- I would never do anything to hurt any of my girls. Especially you. You know that, don't you? I know that. [phones ringing] It's just on your left. Mrs. Regan is here. -Hi. -Come in, come in. -Kelly? -Hi, yes. -I'm Marley Pickett. -Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Please take a seat. Oh, thank you. You have a very lively office. Yeah, I like to work in a space that promotes creativity. Sadly, I don't get to spend as much time here as I'd like. I have to stay mobile. Wherever one of my companies has a problem, that's where I go. Right now, my biggest problem is this scooter rental company I funded. What's wrong with it? Well, people keep cannibalizing the scooters and selling the parts. I have to figure out a way to stop it. Wouldn't it be easier to make the parts so inexpensive that even if they're stolen, you could just replace them and still make money on the rentals? I don't know if we could do that, but I like the way you think. Thank you. I feel very creative around you. I'm going to like working with you. -Thank you. -Excuse me a second. Yeah, Marley here. Hi. We were supposed to meet outside and then go to the mall. Oh, I can't do that. I got other plans. Oh. What were you doing in Coach Nina's office? -Are you in trouble? -No. She just gave me some more of these. What are these? I don't know, just vitamins, I guess. Why? Cool. Hey, those are mine. I don't want to get in trouble. You're not going to get in trouble. Unless I tell everyone you're getting drugs from Coach Nina. You'll get kicked out of school and she'll get fired. Ethan, you'd better not do that. I got to go work out. Ethan, you jerk. You were supposed to give me a ride. Why weren't you in the weight room tonight? I could've used a spotter. Sorry man, I had to go home. I'm telling you bro, between this stuff I've been taking, and now the stuff I got from Tanya, I'm going to be so ripped. Oh, what? Can I get some of that? No man, get your own stuff. You're always riding my coattails, dude. (tires squeal) Hey! (honks horn) Hey, are you kidding me, what are you doing? This is my spot. Seriously, hey. What are you doing, get out of here! This is my spot. What's your problem? I was here first, it's mine. (gasping) (people shouting) [Woman] Call 911! Did he say yes? Marley had his accounts people run our numbers and they liked them. Did he say yes? He and his staff tested all our products. Did he say yes? And they love everything, the way our line looked and felt, everything. So he said yes? Maybe. Maybe he said yes? He said maybe, and that he'll let us know as soon as possible. That's not a yes. It's not a no... (sobbing) What's this all about? Did something happen to Ethan? Hmm? Amelie. Lisa, what happened? -It's Ethan. -What happened? They're saying it was a car accident. Is he hurt? I don't... No, he's dead. Oh my God, Lisa... Okay, they've canceled classes. I think we should head home. Lisa, honey, do you need a ride? Mmm-hmm, thank you. I drove here. No, you're a little shaken up, though, okay? Maybe you can come back and get your car later. Okay. It's Coach Nina. What did she say? She says that cheer practice and tryouts are not canceled. That is so hardcore. She says since there's no class, she expects us at practice by 8:30. You're kidding. Noelle, I know someone has to be last, but why does it always have to be you? Good morning, Coach Nina. Morning, Mrs. Regan. Amelie, Lisa, why don't you girls go inside and get suited up? Before they do that, do you have a moment to talk? Yeah, always happy to talk to a parent. Noelle, pick up your feet! Sorry about that, I always have to keep up on them. Look, I don't want to second guess you, but do you think it's wise to have practice? School was canceled today. I know, but it gives me more of a chance to work on the girls with things that need attention. But a young boy died today. A boy these girls know. I realize that, but they'll have time to mourn. Girls, I'm really sorry about what happened to Evan. Ethan. Ethan. But it was an accident. Ethan was an athlete, and from what I know, a really dedicated one. I think you would honor his memory most by doing your best today at practice, instead of going home. -That may be, but-- -Mrs. Regan... I also think that this'll help keep the girls' minds off their problems for a couple of hours. -Possibly, but-- -Mom. But you're not their mother, and I-- Mom, you're embarrassing me. I'm sorry, honey, I didn't mean to. It's okay, I just... I want to go to practice. Are you sure? Yeah. Okay. What about you, Lisa? I want to go home. I'll give you a lift. Thank you, Mrs. Regan. I'll have them out by noon. Do you have someone to pick her up, or do you want me to give Amelie a lift? Thank you, that's very kind of you, but I'll take care of it. Okay, bye, sweetheart, I'll see you at noon. -Okay, thanks Mom. -Okay. Bye Lisa. Why don't you text your mom and let her know I'm bringing you home? Okay. (soft dramatic music) Lamar, you're the principal. When you hired me to coach the cheerleading team, you said you wanted the best. I realize that and I do want the best, but some of the parents are complaining about the long hours. You have to remember these are just children and they have other obligations. Yeah, well if they're not going to learn responsibility now, when will they? Now why don't we continue this discussion after school. (door knocking) Come in. Hi, I'm Detective Jack Logan. I called earlier and said I'd be coming by. Are you Nina Sendak? I am and I was expecting you. Is this a bad time? No. No, Principal Graham and I were just finishing up. Why don't we talk later, Coach? Detective. It's nice to meet you in person. Why are you interviewing me about a student's car accident? Standard procedure. I'm talking to all the teachers and staff. Is there more to it than a car accident? Well, this is confidential. I understand. We found drugs in a student's car. Marijuana? Steroids. Unprescribed. We believe he died of a heart attack brought on by steroid use. That's awful. I never suspected. Well, it's not uncommon, as I'm sure you know, for athletes to try anything to get an edge. Do you have any idea where Ethan may have been getting the steroids? Not yet. We've spoken to everybody: coaches, friends, even Ethan's girlfriend, Tori? Tanya. Right, Tanya Herrington, yeah. She said she had no idea. Well I'm sorry I can't be of any help. I don't have any useful information. Alrighty. Thank you for your time and sorry to hear about Ethan. It's horrible, but accidents happen. Yeah. I'll be in touch. Waiting for someone, pretty lady? You got it? I do, but you first. Yeah... Okay. What you need all this for? What do you care? Someone told me you're actually helping to boost this country's next great generation of athletes. So what? So I don't think your fellow educators would approve of you sharing this with your students. You know, that's none of your business. This is your business. You've got my money, now give me the stuff. I need some more of your money. Price goes up, and the risk goes up. The risk is all mine, give me the stuff. I want five hundred more. Next time maybe, not now. Now. Or there won't be a next time. There won't even be a this time. Listen! No, you get your hands off my car you crazy lady, nobody touches my ride. I'm sorry, I-- Please, don't... Don't ever touch my car. I have your money. -Good morning. -Good morning. Is this green too bright? Maybe. Do you think we'll hear from him? Hear from who? You know who, Mr. Moneybags. -Marley? -Yes, Marley Pickett. It's been almost two weeks and he hasn't said anything about whether or not he wants to fund us. I'm sure we'll know soon. If he calls within the next few days, that's a yes. And if we don't hear from him, that's a no. Which green do you like better? The kind of green that Marley Pickett's supposed to give us. Why are you so nervous? Sun Style's doing fine. We're keeping up the borders and paying our bills, we'll get funding from someone eventually. I know, it's just I was convinced he was the one that was going to make us rich. Is everything okay, Nat? Is there anything I can help you with? No, everything's fine. You know me, I've got the patience of a rattlesnake. (Kelly laughs) And I think I see your daughter coming back from her run. I'll never have to hire a watch dog as long as you're around. I'm a little worried she's overdoing it. You're supposed to worry, you're a mother. If you didn't, they would revoke your mommy card. Mommy card? Mommy cards, they send them out in the mail. You have to get them renewed every year like a dog license. (Kelly laughs) Don't you have to go brew up some sort of super duper protein shake to help keep her strong? Yes, I will be back in a half an hour so we can go over the samples and the numbers. You better hurry, she might collapse. Oh my God, Tanya, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to drop you. Yeah, right. What's up, klutzo? Klutzo? Yeah, that's the third time you've dropped me. Hey, she didn't do it on purpose. No one asked you. Look, if you're too wimpy to cut it, take your spaghetti arms and go home, but don't ever drop me. Okay, ever. What's your problem? Tanya! Let's break this up. Tanya, go to the locker room. That's it for the day. -Whatever. -Excuse me? I'm sorry, I mean yes, Coach Nina. That's better. Amelie... Let's go to my office. I mean, Tanya's right. Ever since my growth spurt this year, I'm too tall to lift and I'm not strong enough to lift the other girls. Are you doing all of your core exercises? I am, but I'm so lame they're not working. I know it's hard, Amelie, and I know that you're really worried about showing results. I mean, I don't want to just make the squad. Don't get me wrong, that's huge, but I really want to be captain. I want to make my mom proud. Well I'm pretty sure you'll make the squad. Thank you, Coach Nina. But even though you do have a lot of potential, if you want to be captain-- I do. Then you have to be the best. I'll do anything. I want to show you something. What are those? I took these when I was a cheerleader before my injury. I still take them now. Are they vitamins? You might say that, sort of. They're supplements. What do they do? Well they help build lean muscle mass, you know, combined with a really good workout, they can help you with your strength issues. If you're dedicated. I do really want to be captain. But I don't know if I can take those from you. First of all, Amelie, this conversation is just between you and me. I think it's better if your parents don't know. I understand. And I can't give you these. Why not? What I can do, is leave them here. I'm leaving now, but if you want them, the bottle is there for you to take. It's entirely your decision. I'll see you at practice tomorrow. (suspenseful music) Be careful. Okay, I'm just going to warm that. We're getting pretty close here, is our daughter going to grace us with her presence this evening? She's exhausted, as I said I've never seen her work so hard. Well it's a good thing, isn't it? I guess. Did you hear something? Hear what? Nothing, I'll check. -This is looking good here. -Okay. (suspenseful music) Scott, there's someone sitting in a car outside. It's probably just a teenager. You know kids at that age, they've got nothing to do but hang out in cars. I guess. Honey, the chicken's ready, come on. Okay, I'll be there in a minute. I just want to check one more thing. But the salad isn't ready! Yes, I'm going to come help you with the salad, just hold on. (shrieks) Hi, Mrs. Regan. I hope I didn't startle you. Oh my God, Coach Nina, I am so sorry. Please come in. You know, again, I am so sorry. I was just reaching for the doorbell-- No, it was my fault. I was being the snoopy homeowner. Thank you again for bringing Amelie's backpack over. I'm really sorry if it inconvenienced you, Coach. No, I just didn't want you worrying about it. You know, it's nice to come and meet my girls' families. I don't have daughters of my own. Can you tell us more about the time you were a cheerleader with Dallas? I didn't actually perform for Dallas, or in the NFL. I did the tryouts, I was hired while I was still in college. Why didn't you go? I was injured, but honestly, I didn't want to be a pro. I liked competitive cheerleading more. Why? Well, to go to the nationals. To win the big competitions, that's what I really wanted to do. But I never did. And that's what I want for you. That's what I want, too. To win a championship, and then a scholarship. It's impressive how Amelie's so ambitious. Well, she gets that from her mom. She was a cheerleader too, you know. I didn't know that. I was. That's why I have a present for Amelie. What? Open it! Mom, this is your championship ring. I thought you could hold onto it until you win your own. I'm going to be a champion, just like you. I didn't realize that you won a championship. Oh, Kelly took her squad all the way to National Championships twice. The Nationals, really? We were very fortunate, and we had a great coach. Have you ever been to nationals? Not yet. I was on the squad, but then I got pregnant. Really? What happened? Amelie... It's fine. -I lost the baby. -I'm so sorry. That's... That must have been very challenging. It was, but it focused me. And since I can't have children of my own, my team, every girl on the squad, is my child. It's wonderful that you found your passion. (loud blending) Mom, do we have any more egg whites? No, you finished them, but I'll pick up some more today when I go to the supermarket. Thanks. You've certainly grown an appetite in the last couple of weeks. I just want to be strong. I've got to build muscle if I'm going to be a lifter. That's fine, as long as you're safe. Are you going to finish that? (Kelly laughs) I'm glad you're so dedicated to your cheerleading practice, but I haven't seen you doing much homework lately. I'm fine. I'm serious, Amelie, if you want to stay on the cheer squad, you have to promise me that you'll keep your grades up. I promise, promise, promise I'll keep the grades up. Thank you. I love you. (groaning) What? I can't hug my little girl anymore? Just let me know whenever you need help. Oh, and don't forget that tonight we've got the mother daughter benefit dinner at the women's shelter. I forgot. Amelie, how could you forget? We go every year. It's just... Okay fine, whatever. Can you just pick me up after practice? I'd love to. Oh, and don't forget to bring an outfit with you. Wow. (bell rings) You got so much better. When you lifted me during practice, it felt a lot smoother. That's because I'm a genuine power girl now. (Lisa laughs) Where are you flying off to now, power girl? My mom's picking me up, actually, there's this mother daughter charity thing that she wants to go to. It's corny, but she really wants to do it, so. Okay, well, I'll see you later then? Yeah, I'll catch you tomorrow? Yes, bye dude. (slow suspenseful music) Amelie. Oh my God, Coach Nina... You leaving already? I thought practice was over? But I thought you were going to work out after practice? I am, I was, I mean... I promised I'd meet my mom. Do you want to go to nationals? I do. And do you want to become captain and win a scholarship? I do, Coach Nina, but-- But nothing. I suggest you go back in there and start working out. Scott, I bought some frozen pizzas in case you're feeling too lazy to cook. Oh, thanks. I thought I might pick up some pad thai on the way home. Now go have fun with Amelie. (phone buzzes) Oh, she's texting me now. What's she saying? She said she can't make it, she has to stay late for practice. How many times is it this month? I don't know and I planned this for weeks. Is her practice schedule getting out of control? I'm starting to think so. I'm sorry, honey. I guess you're stuck with me. Make sure you pick up enough noodles for two and I can go over some numbers in my office after dinner. Your wish is my command. See you soon. Thanks, bye. ¶ Down the lonely road I go ¶ ¶ To wash away my sins ¶ ¶ When you hear that mournful cry ¶ ¶ You'll know just where I've been ¶ Hey, honey. I'm going to go for a run to burn off some of this pad thai. Thanks again for picking up dinner. I use the skills that I have. Be safe. I will, don't work too late, okay? I'll try not to. (rattling noise) Scott? Is that you? (rattling continues) Scott? Scott, is that you? Scott? Kelly? Whoa, hey! It's me! It's Marley. Oh my gosh. I am so sorry, are you okay? Yeah, I take it you didn't get my text that I was coming by. No, I left my phone in the house before dinner and I was working out here. I tried the front door, there was no answer. I saw a light in the backyard so I came around. You could get killed that way. Yeah, or at least scrubbed clean. Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry, can I get you something? Do you want to sit down? Water, beer? Thank you, I've caused you enough trouble. I just wanted to come by and tell you face to face that I want to fund Sun Style. That is wonderful! But why did you come tonight? I'm not really an office hours kind of guy, and I like to give good news face to face. I hope it's not always this exciting. Yeah, no. But this is exciting! You're funding Sun Style! Thank you so much! I can't wait to start working with you. We're going to do great things together. Expect a call from my lawyers in the next day or two about contracts and uh, I've got to bounce. Got a few more appointments, but we'll talk soon. Thank you! Did you drive here? No, I took one of my scooters. Saving the planet and all that. Oh, nice. Bye! Poor Ethan's parents, losing their son. Is there anywhere you want to go? Or do you want to hang out with your friends? I'm going to go see what Lisa's doing. Okay, I love you, sweetheart. Yeah, okay. Hey, Tanya. How are you feeling? As if you care what I feel. What does that mean? You know what I mean. You only cared about making captain, you never cared about Ethan at all and now he's dead. That's not true! Liar! What's wrong with you? Don't touch me! -Amelie, stop it! -Break it up! (screams) -Enough! -She hit me first! You broke my arm. I did not, you hit me! Okay, let's go home. Amelie, do what your mother says. You are my daughter, you know better than this. Right, because you're so perfect. Amelie, go home and rest. I need you strong for practice tomorrow. Mrs. Regan, take care of my star. I will take care of my daughter, but I would like to continue this conversation tomorrow if you have the time. Yeah, come after practice. Tanya, let's go. So this Tanya girl really broke her arm? No, thank goodness, but it's a nasty sprain. Wow, cheerleading is more intense than I thought. I don't know if it's just cheerleading. Amelie hasn't been acting the same lately. Well, come on, honey. You know, teenage girls and mood swings are nothing new. But this is something different. Amelie was so fierce. I have never seen anything like that. Well, you do get that in sports sometimes. I mean, football players can get like that. Although in their case, they're usually on steroids. You don't think she's on something? Steroids? No, come on. Like I said, teenage girls. I'm tired, I'm going to go to bed. Okay. -Good night. -Good night. Scott... Yeah? I don't want to overreact, but I'm her mother. Amelie is my only child and something tells me this is more than teenage girl stuff. Okay. I think Amelie needs to stay away from Coach Nina. All right. I'll back you up on that as long as you realize she is going to be so upset when we tell her. Yeah. Night. Love you. Love you too. (soft piano music) (upbeat hip hop music) All right ladies, keep going. Work hard, I want five more! I want winners. Wow, it's loud. Yeah, wow is right. Strong winners, I want winners. We are winners! (whistle blows) Take five! Scott and I appreciate how hard you've been working with the girls, but after that incident between Tanya and Amelie yesterday... We're just worried about Amelie keeping her life balanced. I'm upset about the incident too. But clearly Tanya was the one who was the instigator, which is why she's off the squad. I'm sorry to hear that. But Scott and I think Amelie should take a break as well. What, no! No, that's not fair! Amelie. I just want a chance to win, Mom had hers. You're taking mine away. You are not helping your cause right now. I respect your decision, but this is bad news for the team. We appreciate how much your value Amelie-- We have nationals in two weeks and with Tanya out of the picture... I planned on making Amelie captain. Really? That's amazing, thank you. Please can I stay on the team? Honey, what do you think? If we say yes, do you promise that you'll keep-- I'll do anything, I promise to keep up my grades up, I'll clean the house, I'll do whatever you want. Please. We don't want to deprive you of the opportunity. But you have got to listen to everything that your mother and I tell you, understood? Promise. Thank you! Thank you. I'm just confused over this point. I thought Marley Pickett's people already agreed to pick up those costs. (phone buzzes) Can you hold on Laura? I've got to get my daughter out the door for school. Bye, Mom. Amelie, do you have your lunch? Sorry Laura, my daughter just zoomed by. Oh no, she forgot her backpack. Can I call you back? (slow suspenseful music) We already put a deposit on the fabric, so I don't see why you're telling me we have to pay before you'll deliver it, that's not our agreement. Nat, do you know what these are? Mr. DeCaro, I'll have to call you back. Have a good day. What do you have here? I don't know, do you know what they are? I think they're pills. Nat, don't be cute. I found them in Amelie's backpack and after the way she's been acting lately-- How are your allergies? I don't have allergies. Then you won't need these. What do you mean? They're antihistamines. Are you sure? Yes, non-drowsy, too. So you've got nothing to worry about. Oh my gosh. I am so relieved. I can't believe how stressed I am about Amelie. Is it more than the regular mother daughter stuff? I don't know, I've never had a teenager in the house before so it could-- Mom! What are you doing? What are you doing back home? I forgot my bag so I came back to get it. Why are you snooping in it? She was just asking me if I would drive it to school for you and some stuff fell out. -Liar, I hate you both. -Wait, Amelie! I would let her cool down. I just miss my sweet little daughter. Do you think this kind of change is normal? The bad news is it probably is. The good news is that you are ready for pollen season. Okay, thanks. (suspenseful music) Hey, I've got something to tell you. I don't really want to talk to you. I didn't say I wanted to talk to you. That would imply I cared what you had to say. I've got something to tell you. What? I covered for you. You did? I told your mom those weren't steroids. But they're not steroids, they're supplements. I don't know what you think they are, but I used to run track and field in college, I know steroids when I see them. Okay, even if they are, why didn't you tell her? I should've, but I really don't want to see you get in trouble. I did some things when I was your age and getting punished never helped, it just made me double down and do even stupider things. What kind of stupid things? Nevermind. The point is I need you to promise me you'll stop taking them and I won't tell your mom what they really are. I'm not even taking that many. You shouldn't be taking any. You don't need them to get onto your squad. You're on the cheer squad now, aren't you? Yeah. So you can stop taking them. Because if you don't and your parents find out, they will pull you off that squad so fast your head will spin. Kind of defeats the purpose of taking them in the first place, doesn't it? Yeah, I guess. Look, your mom is my best friend in the whole world. If she knew what I was doing here, I would be out not only a friend, but probably a job. Do you understand what I'm risking for you? Yeah, thanks. You don't have to thank me. Actually, I take that back. You can thank me by making more of an effort with your mom. And by quitting those pills. All right, I will. How are you feeling? I'm okay. My muscles are still sore, but this feels nice. I'm so glad you could come with me, it's been ages since we've done a mother daughter mani-pedi. Do you like the nails the same colors as your fingernails, or do you want them clear? Same color, I guess. Do you want to go to the art museum afterwards? They opened a new tea room on the roof of the museum. Maybe. Do you want me to help you with your science project this week? It's not due for another two weeks. Careful, sensitive. I'm sorry, I'll be more gentle. Two weeks isn't a lot of time, especially when you've got two papers due. I know what I have due, Mom. You don't need to keep reminding me. I didn't mean to be bossy, I just want to help. If you want to help, maybe leave me alone sometime. Amelie, I wasn't going to bring it up, but your father and I got a notice from school about your grades. So? We're supposed to meet with the principal, I'm afraid it's bad news. What? No, that's so unfair. Ow, careful, that hurts. I'm so sorry. Amelie, stop that. Stop telling me what to do, she stabbed me. Amelie, it was an accident. I want to go home now. -Wait, Amelie-- -Now! Amelie! This is not good news. Amelie has three D's, one C, and it looks like an F in math. What? Amelie was always such a stellar student, which is why this comes as such a surprise. Well, I'm afraid it might not be such a surprise. What do you mean? We both think Amelie is too caught up in her extracurricular activities. Cheerleading. That's the chief one, but it's clear she needs to spend more time focusing on studying. I think it would be a shame if a talented student such as Amelie dropped all of her extracurricular activities. Perhaps if you hired a tutor, or-- Do you really think that cheerleading is so important that it should ruin her grades? Not at all, I was just saying that-- And we're worried about her behavior. If she wasn't just a teenage girl, I'd swear she's on something. That is not funny, Scott. It's not supposed to be. I'm worried. I understand your concerns, but children-- I'm not sure you do. I think Coach Nina is teaching these kids the wrong values. I'm actually going to write a letter to the school district about my concerns. You're certainly entitled to be worried. But do you think it's Coach Nina's fault? No, Amelie is our daughter and our responsibility. But, we both feel that Coach Nina is not a good influence on her. What? They're the girl's parents, they can do what they want. And did he really say he thought his daughter was on drugs? He just said she was acting like she was on something. Do you think she could be? Of course not. I take care of my girls, they're like my children. My own children. I don't tolerate anything like that, and you better know it. I realize that, but you can't-- Why didn't you bring this up earlier? Before this happened? How come you can't talk to her teachers about getting her grades up? If she doesn't actually do the work, that's illegal. You can get fired for that. Oh, and who's going to fire me? You? That would be the worst sexual harassment case in the history of this school. Boss. That's not fair, you're the one who... Shut up, Lamar. What are you doing now? I'm going to go clean up a mess. Amelie, I know you think that we're being hard on you, but we're just trying to do what's best for you, okay? Your grades cannot suffer because of cheerleading. Yeah, but you're going to be sorry. Amelie, your father and I discussed this, okay? If you get your grades up, you'll get to rejoin the cheer squad. It'll be too late by then. I know you want to go to nationals. But you might just have to wait until next year. If I'm not there, the team doesn't go and everybody hates me. Amelie, that is not true. You think I'm not good enough? Now you're twisting my words. Or are you afraid I'm going to show you up because I'm better than you? Or are you just jealous because you're old? Amelie, that is not true and it's just mean. Your father and I love you very much and we are not trying to punish you. Yes you are, and I hate you both! Amelie... Amelie! (sighs) I thought we'd settled this yesterday with Marley's lawyers. Why do they want to discuss it again? Apparently they want to go over the contract again. This is the second time they've done this. Oh, shoot. What happened? Oh, no, sorry, that wasn't for you. I left my wallet at home and I'm headed to the gas station. I need to go pick it up, it's on the kitchen counter. (slow suspenseful music) Come on... Where would she hide it? Yeah, I'm just pulling into the driveway. I'll be in and out in no time. Got to go, bye. (keys jingling) Who are you? I'm the new cleaning woman. I was just leaving. Kelly's had the same cleaning woman for years and you-- Why don't you mind your own business? I'm calling the cops. No you're not. Get off of me! Marley? Marley? Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. No, that's okay. Sorry, I was working all night I must have zonked hard. Is this not a good time? I could come back. No, no, come on in. I'm looking forward to talking to you. Would you like one? It's the first entirely organic brand of energy drink. I own a piece of it. No, but thank you. I'm really excited about Sun Style. I've been talking to my marketing team about how to take it even wider. Wider? Yeah, rather than just marketing towards hikers and gardeners, the UV-resistant line, I was thinking maybe we should go for a younger demographic. You mean like infants or toddlers? Not that young. The marketing team thinks that we can reach out and connect Sun Style with trendsetters, party kids. You think kids who go to nightclubs worry about UV? That's just the thing. Our research shows that they care a lot more about health issues than their parents did at that age. They worry about everything. Cigarettes, unhealthy food, too much sun. That's why this energy drink sells so well to teenagers. It tastes good, it gives them a boost, but it's also healthy, or organic, anyway. Really? I didn't realize. So with your permission, I'd like to put more money into Sun Style and create a subsidiary fashion line with a younger look. I don't see why not. You mean you like the idea? I love it. That's great. Yeah, usually creators can be protective of their concept. Well, as far as I can tell, my concept will still be the same and your idea will just be an addition to that line. That's right. I love it. -Cheers. -Cheers. Stop! What are you doing here? The better question is what are you doing? What I'm always doing. What's that? Protecting you. (cries) I... Oh, get it together, Nina. Hey Lisa, can you help me? How come you're still working out? I want to get strong for the squad. Can you spot? I want to bench. I can't, I thought we were going home. Do you still need a ride? C'mon, it's like 15 minutes. I need your help. I can't, I told my mom I'd be home by seven. Why don't you just text her? Because she wants me to come home. What is your problem? I need your help, are you my friend or not? I am your friend-- If you're my friend, then you'll help me. Loser. [Kelly] I know, can you believe that? [Scott] You said yes? Of course I did! Really? Sounds like a weird way to market UV protection clothes. Scott, when someone tells you they want to invest more money in your company and help you sell your stuff to thousands more people, you don't say, "No." Yeah, I can't wait to tell Nat, she's going to be more excited than I am. (screams) Oh my God. Help! Well, it's too early to say for certain, Mr. and Mrs. Regan, but this looks like it was an accident. So you're saying Nat just fell into the pool? How could that happen? She knows how to swim. Anyone can stumble or fall and hit their head. Happens a lot, trip and a fall. And while it can feel senseless, that's often the explanation. Here. Please call me if you have any questions. Thank you Detective Logan, we will. Thanks. You okay? Something's just not right. Hey. Hi. I'm sorry that I yelled at you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I've been so freaked out lately. No, I understand. I heard about your mom's friend. I can't believe it. That's like the second dead person we know. I know, first Ethan and now Nat. She was cool, too. How's your mom taking it? Who cares? She's heartless, she made me quit cheerleading and now I'm not going to get a scholarship. She doesn't care about anyone. -That's-- -Amelie. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you. Hi, Lisa. Can we talk for a moment? Mmm-hmm. It's just so unfair, you know? I miss cheerleading, it's just so unfair. Do you really want to go to nationals? Well yeah, but I can't. I think there's a way. There's a way for you to show your mom you're just as good as she is. How if I'm not on the team? Being off the team means you can't participate in school events. I know. I've enrolled the team in the nationals, which officially is not a school event. What does that mean? It means that if you keep working out, practicing-- Then I can go to nationals with the team? I can't stop you from coming to the gym, or going to the field when we're practicing. Really? And I haven't told anyone that you quit. I didn't quit, my mom-- I know, you were forced to. But I haven't told anyone, so all you have to do is show up. And don't tell anyone. Okay. You're like a daughter to me. Thank you. You're my chance to finally win after all these years. (Scott sighs) I can't believe she's gone. Me either. So, I'll ship all this stuff to her family? Yeah, I told her sister I'd send her all of Nat's things. Okay. When's the funeral? I'm not sure if they're having one, I think. They're just doing a memorial service with her family in Tampa. Makes it all feel so final. I don't know how it could get much worse. Hey... It's going to be okay. It's going to get better, okay? Look, I'm going to take care of this stuff. Are you going to be all right? Do you have anything to do today? I actually have another appointment with Marley. Are you sure you're up for that? Not really, but his lawyers keep procrastinating and my lawyers keep calling me, which costs me money, so, it's cheaper if I just talk to him in person. And I guess it'll keep my mind off other things. Okay, I'll get out of here. Hey... I love you. I love you. (cries) I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner Mrs. Pemberton, I was waiting for my client at his office for an hour, but he never showed up or called. I'll make sure to get the billing out to you as soon as I get back to my office. Oh no, I'm sorry, can I call you back? I'm just having a little emergency. No, I'm fine, I'll call you back. Okay. I don't know who could've done it, Scott, but I'm okay. The tire shop sent a tow truck and I took an Uber to a coffee shop to wait. It probably was just some kids. I'll let you know if I learn anything else. All right I love you, talk to you later. Bye. Hi, can I please get a medium regular coffee, with just a little room? [Barista] Caramel macchiato for Liza? Was that for Lisa? Yes, I'm sorry about that. Lisa? -Hi, Mrs. Regan. -Hi. Where's Amelie, isn't she with you? Amelie? No. She told me you guys were hanging out together after school today. I did see Amelie. At cheerleading practice. Cheerleading practice? Yeah, Amelie stayed afterward. She said she wanted to go over some moves with Coach Nina. She's been off the team for over a week. I have to go now, Mrs. Regan. I'm sorry, Lisa, I didn't mean to put you in the middle of all of this. -Bye. -Bye. (phone dialing) Scott, it's me again, call me. We need to talk to somebody about Coach Nina. Lamar! What the hell is going on here? I'm betting it's a note from the Superintendent suspending you. Why don't you sit down? You can't fire me, I will sue you for sexual harassment. First of all, you weren't fired. You were suspended, pending review. Oh, what-- And secondly, Nina, it's not from me, it's from the Superintendent. That means it's out of my hands. Out of your hands? Amelie Regan's parents complained to the board. I repeat, not to me. Apparently several other parents did as well. Now, you'll get your chance to present your side of the case to an employee review board. No, if you don't help me, I will make sure you lose your job. Nina, I can't help you, this is out of my control. I'll show you out of control. Nina? What are you doing at my house? I'm sorry, I just wanted to talk to you about practice and I was passing by. You came here to ask about practice. You should have just called. I know, but-- My wife is going to be home in like five minutes, we can't talk now. It's just, we haven't talked in a long time and you don't call me back. Now listen to me, Nina. You know I'm married. That didn't stop you from-- What's done is done. I need you to be an adult about this. But you don't love me? We'll talk about this tomorrow, okay? Like I said, my wife... Now. Go home, okay? Goodnight. [door knocking] Why are you-- I forgot something. You said you loved me. [Kelly] Then I heard from the school Coach Nina's suspended. [Scott] Not fired? Not yet, at least. Hey, have you seen Amelie today? She was still asleep when I left, or at least her bedroom door was locked. I did, but she's still not speaking to me. It's been a week since we yanked her off the squad, you'd think she'd be getting over it by now. This could take years. Please tell me you're kidding. I am, but only a little. I think we need to schedule some family counseling and talk about regaining each other's trust. Yeah, that couldn't hurt. When do you think you'll be home? Well it's almost nine, the freeway's probably clear, so in about an hour. (phone buzzes) That's strange. What's that? I got a text from Amelie asking me to pick her up at the school. She's supposed to be grounded, she should've been home hours ago. I checked with her after school, she said she was home. Why would she go back to school? Do you think this has anything to do with Coach Nina? I don't know, but I better go get her. Okay, well, let me know if I can do anything. Love you. (phone buzzing) Scott? I have a bad feeling about this, meet me at the school. Amelie? Amelie? (dark suspenseful music) Amelie? (Kelly gasps) Oh my God, Amelie! Are you okay? Mom, behind you! No! (Kelly gasps) Help! Amelie! Where are you? Where is my daughter? Amelie! I said, where is my daughter? Please, let her go. I'll give you anything. It's too late. Hey, Coach. Check out my cast. Sexy, huh? Very nice, why aren't you at home? I want to go to practice. Nina, you know you're off the team. I can't be! The only reason I fell and got injured was because I was pregnant. -Nina. -With your baby! Hold it right there. How would you like it if I told the police about those steroids I found in your locker? You're the one who told me to take them in the first place. I never made you do anything. Now, maybe you should go home. Now who's off the squad? (tires screeching) You stole my chance for a championship. I deserved to win a national championship, but everybody steals it from me. My coach used me and threw me away like garbage. I'm so sorry, I can't imagine. No. You can't. What are you doing with my ring? This? This is my championship ring now. And I'm taking it. I brought you here so you can watch me take everything you've ever wanted. Please just let me help you. You're the one who needs help. What's that? No! Oh my God, Mom, she's crazy. Thank you for coming back. I'm sorry, honey. Don't worry, I'm going to get us out of here. [Nina] You can't get away from me! -Oh my God. -Come on, hurry! [Nina] You can't get away from me! I'm going to eat you alive! Come on! This way, this way. Come on, hurry. Here, get in! You can't get away from me! No! Die! You won't get away, die! Ow! Mom, are you okay? Yeah... (police sirens) This is mine. No, it's mine! Come back, the ring is mine! You can't get away! Honey? Dad! Oh my gosh, are you okay? What happened? What's going on? ¶ Down the lonely road I go ¶ ¶ To wash away my sins ¶ ¶ When you hear that mournful cry ¶ ¶ You'll know just where I've been ¶ ¶ I can see the congregation gathered at the shore ¶ ¶ Whispering in quiet songs that I'm to be no more ¶ So, did you have to like, go to Coach Nina's trial and testify? She didn't have a trial, she just plead guilty. To killing your mom's friend? No, they couldn't prove that. She just plead guilty to assault and being nuts in general. I heard they sent her to jail. It's just probation still. And she's seeing a shrink and has to take medication. What's your mom doing? She sold her company to some big wig and now she's looking for a new career. That's scary. Why's that scary? Whenever moms decide to try something new, it's always scary. Ladies, as you know, I've only been your principal for a month now. And my first major responsibility has been to hire a new cheerleading coach. So it's my pleasure to introduce your new coach, a former National Championship cheerleader. Miss Kelly Regan. (team claps) Thank you so much. I can't tell you how thrilled I am. -Wow. -My mom's kind of cool. Think this means I get captain? Hey, you're still going to have to earn it. All right girls, let's get into formation. Show me what you've got. Ready and five, six, seven, eight! (slow electronic music)
