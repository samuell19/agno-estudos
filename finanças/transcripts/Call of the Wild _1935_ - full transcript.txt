Whoa! Mush! Now beat it! All right, I'll leave, if that's the way you feel about it. But I'll leave like a gentleman. Quiet, everybody! Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please! You're about to take your last look at Mr. Thornton's handsome, smiling face. So make the most of it, you weasels! But, as a last insane gesture, Mr. Thornton wants you all to step up to the bar and have a drink with him! Quiet! Are you ready? Let's go! To the bar, everybody! There you are! Hiya, Tex. Hiya, dude. The boys're telling me you're going home. Yep. Catching tomorrow's boat. Well, there's no use in wishing you luck. I guess you've had plenty. Give me Michigan Avenue on a hot afternoon and you can have all the yellow dust this side of Seattle. I guess we all feel the same way, kid. It seems that all the homesick guys in the world came up here. Put this away for me. It's wearing me down. Sure thing. - Ah, they been kinda running against you. - Yeah. Oh, thanks. Give us a couple more stacks. Here's where I'm apt to earn my fare back to Seattle. There you are. Did I say Seattle? You'd better quit while you still have the price of a pick and shovel, dude. What's the matter? You want your grave dug? Give us some action! I'm buying! Well, the hot seat went cold, eh? Better luck next time, dude. Yeah. Yeah, I hope so. Well, so long, fellas. - So long. - So long, dude. Russ, my stomach wants to know how my credit is. Well, if your stomach's as good as your credit, you'll live to be 100. Thanks. Did I ever tell you about my grandpa? Died when he was 1086. - What interrupted his youth? - He quit drinking. So they cleaned you out, en? That's tough. Ah, there's a lot more where that came from. What's the matter, Mr. Thornton? Ain't you speakin' to your pals since you got rich? Well, hello, shorty! How are ya? - Have a stimulant. - Thanks. - When'd you get out? - This afternoon. These bastilles up here ain't as cozy as them stirs down in little ol' New York. The finest jailhouse I ever seen was the coney island precinct. They sent you up for opening the mails, didn't they? Shh! Shh! That was a miscarriage of justice. Listen... ah! All I did on that mail route was peek in a couple of those bill 0' dues. It gets darned lonesome on the trail there. I was as innocent-like as if I was sittin' in the New York public library. Letters are supposed to be private, even up here. Well, if I wasn't honest trying to seal it up, I wouldn't have got caught. - That's too bad. - Well, I wouldn't say that. That letter I opened was very interesting. Yeah? Yeah. If you'd have saved a bit of your bankroll, I'd have cut you in on somethin'. Oh. More mail? Yes and no. That letter I opened was worth about a million bucks. Thanks very much for the snort-ola. Ah! See ya around sometime. Hey, shorty! Shorty! Wait a minute. Let me hear a little more about that pipe dream of yours. Pipe dream is right. I been dreamin' about this for six months up in that cold arctic can. - Yeah? What do you need a bankroll for? - Well, I... Hey, youse guys! Get outta here! 23 skiddoo! Boo! I need a bankroll to grubstake us as far as Dawson city and then a long way beyond that. Yeah? That sounds interesting. You know somethin'? When they caught me opening those letters, and the judge presented me with six months, or, as the english jockeys say, a dozen fortnights, well, that judge asked me a lot of silly questions, like how many letters I'd jimmied, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But there's one question he didn't ask me. Yeah? He didn't ask me what was in that letter. - Say, is your credit still good in there? - I wouldn't be surprised. - Come on. Let's go and exhaust it. - Okay. His name was Blake. Martin Blake. He had red whiskers and, well, he was a little blind. Oh, yeah, I remember. He was cracked. - Told everybody he'd found a rich lode. - That's the guy. Well, he got sick on the trail. He was coming to Dawson city to file his claim. He wrote a letter to his son, John Blake, in San Francisco. He had a note on the envelope, said if anything happened to him, the letter should be mailed. Well, his number was up, so the letter was mailed. And you looked inside to be sure everything was neat and in order. Mmm. But there wasn't much of a letter. It was mostly a map. You made a copy? As I'm coming to the backstretch with a pencil, I feel the long arm of John law on my shoulder. - Did they take the copy away from you? - No. - Then you still have it? - No again. Well, what'd you do with it? I et il. When that map started to digest though, see, it sorta went to my head. Went to my brain. So, while I'm sitting up there in the booby hatch, I made a copy of it from memory. Take off my boot. Well, I'll show you. I got a good memory too. Course, there's a couple of things here I don't quite figure out. Now, you see... I don't know if this 1s a mountain or a river. And I think they said there was rapids here. But I don't see how that could be, because I don't remember no river up there. Hey, listen, little man, the graveyards up here is full of gold hopheads, guys that smoked a pipeful of hope had glittering yellow dreams and ended up under a pile of rocks in frozen ground. Me, I'll take bourbon. Kills you slower, but a lot more pleasant-like. Now, wait a minute, Mr. Thornton. Something mighty strange happened today. Something mighty strange. Yeah? Sit down. I'm standin' out in front of the palace hotel, see. Not doin' nothin', because, well, you know, a fella just out of the can and broke, just lookin' and standin' is about the limit of your activities. - Yeah. - Well, it was a good idea, see. Out of this hotel comes the most beautiful skirt that you ever put your peepers on. And following her is a dignified-lookin' guy, I'd say 46 autumns. And him and her get in the sled and they go off, headed for Dawson city. - Thanks for the society note. - Yeah, but wait. I get excited, see, I run into the hotel and take a look at the ledger. You know the names of these two interesting people? Mr. and Mrs. John Blake of San Francisco. Old man Blake's son? I hope, in my subtle way, I've made myself clear. You have. Look, if I get the money for an outfit, how do we split? Even-Steven. Okay. Wait here. I'll be right back. Listen, they got a day's lead on us. - It's only a gamble. - That's what I like about it. Hot... - Where's Marie, Tex? - She's through for the night. Hey, Marie, I got a... Well... Hello! How are... Didn't take you long, did it? You're gonna hit me? I haven't made up my mind yet. Where's my money? I always admired loyalty, I'm so sentimental. Jack... This is the best way to hit you, sweetheart. What's the matter with this fido? Sorry, Jack, but that one's taken. Belongs to a team I sold yesterday. I'll tell you what. I got a big fella I'll give you for practically nothin'. Fifty bucks! What's the matter with him? He ain't broke yet, and I don't think he's gonna be. Oh. Tough, huh? St. Bernard. He's all animal, Joe. - He's on a hunger strike. - Won't eat anything? Nothin' but your hand or your foot, or points north. He looks like he was stolen from some joint in the states. I never ask a dog no questions. Blue ribbons don't mean nothin' to a pooch up here. How'd you like to see me make this guy eat? All right by me. - I ain't got nothin' to do all winter. - Get some grub. Frank, dinner for one! Unharness little boy blue. Put him right there. - Dinner for one. - Okay. Let him out. - I hope you know what you're doin'. - I hope so too! All right, let go of him. All right, pull your dog out! Don't let your dog get this piece. He'll eat regular from now on. I wish I had time to break him. He'd make a great dog. - All right, frank, put him back. - I'll do it. Here. Which one of you is Mr. groggins? Well, speak up. Is Mr. groggins here? My name is Smith. Are the outfit and provisions ready that were ordered in my name? Well, why don't you answer me, groggins? You speak english, don't you? Uh, yes, sir. Here's your whole outfit. - Tenderfoot, huh? - Not as tender as he looks. If I'm not too inquisitive, will six dogs be enough? - They'll pull the load, all right. - With me on it? Well, I don't know about that. You don't look like a man who knows much about anything, Mr. groggins. Well, I do know that people come up here don't usually make a buggy ride out of it. They walk or run with the dogs, sometimes break trail. You sure will need more dogs if you're gonna ride that sled. And more dog food. And a needle and thread. What for, my intelligent friend? To sew up the guys that's gonna split their sides laughin' at ya! Once in a while people do laugh at me. But very briefly. Well, sir, dogs! Dogs! Uh, bring flip and frowsy. Say, Joe, why don't you show the honorable Mr. Smith this beautiful animal? I don't think so. He's too savage. Is that so? Well, just let him out. - He's liable to get tough, Mr. Smith. - Let him out, I said. What's his name? We call him buck. I don't like to take the responsibility, Mr. Smith. That's why you'll never amount to much. What are you asking for him? Uh, 250 bucks. Sold. Let him out. So your name's buck, en? You're tough, huh? Hey, wait a minute. That dog cost me a lot of money. I pay for my pleasure, Mr. groggins. Wait a minute. That dog belongs to me. I bought him, Smith, and I don't allow my dogs to be shot. That is, of course, unless I shoot them myself. He's not for sale. Just as you say, my good man. Just as you say. Well, what others have you? - Uh, here. Hitch 'em up. - These two will do. I ordered a collapsible bathtub from Seattle. Did it get here? It's a bathtub! It's a bathtub! You sweet meats. You're losing your home. Easy with ye. Come on. Out. Come on. Come on. Come on, harmon. Here ya are, Mr. Smith. We thought it was something to pile wood in. The only bath a person gets up here is by the sweat of the brow. How interesting. Mush! Been a great pleasure, gentlemen. A great pleasure! Nice guys. Well, I don't like to see a dog killed either. But after all, 250 bucks is 250 bucks. All right, I told you I'm buying him, and I am. - We ain't got no time to fool with him. - Quiet, quiet. Whose money is this? Listen, you, you're my dog, and I'm your boss. The sooner you learn that, the easier it's going to be for both of us. Come on! Mush! Mush! Ho! Ho! Right there! Hey! Go on! Get back there! What'd you bring this baboon along for? - That big guy don't like him! - That's just too bad! He'll learn to like him! - Come on! Let's go! Mush! Mush! - Get your teeth out of him! Come on! Get up there! Come on, gray boy! Come on, buck. - What's the matter? - Nearly took my wing off. Come on, big boy. We don't mean you any harm. We're trying to be friendly with you. Buck, come here! Buck, come here! Come on, boy. Nobody's gonna hurt you. Come on, now, be... Buck! Hey, buck! Buck, come here! Well, you can kiss that 250 bucks good-bye. Yep. It's too bad too. He'd have made a great dog. Now he'll either freeze to death, or wolves'll get him. Poor fella. Make yourself at home, buck. Hey! Look, boss! Wolves! Shorty: Is he dead? No, he isn't dead. And he isn't a he. Hey, you know who that is? That's Blake's woman! Oh, John! Oh, John darling! I'm so glad! Oh. Oh... oh, I thought... Is my husband with you? Have you found him? You're the only one we've found so far. What about your husband? I don't know. We ran into trouble and we lost most of our provisions crossing the river. The ice broke, and then some of our dogs died. Two days ago my husband went out to look for food and he hasn't come back. Do you think he's dead? That's a pretty good guess. What are we gonna do with her? What can you do? Take her to Dawson and leave her. You're forgetting one thing, pal. Yeah? She and her old man was looking for the same thing we are. And they had the map, the original one. You'll find my husband for me, won't you? There's nothing we can do. We're a thousand miles from nowhere. Either the cold got him, or the wolves. Get on the sled. We're taking you to Dawson. But you gotta help me find him. He isn't dead. I don't believe that. Hey, listen, lady, in this country when a guy is gone for two days, he's gone. I refuse to go until I definitely know about my husband. If you don't wanna stay and look for him, you can go without me. No! No! Put me down! Put me down! I can't go! I've got to stay! Put me down! Stop! Stop this sled! Whoa! What's the matter? - You untie these straps. - Oh, no, no. You might fall off. I'm doing this for your own good. Later on you'll thank me. I hate you, you beast! Let me out of here! Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me! Whoops! Ha! - Let's go! Mush! - Mush! Beans. It's customary up here, Mrs. Blake, for everybody to pitch in and do their share. You've been with us two days, and you haven't done anything but sit around and look nasty. Can you cook? Yes, I'm considered a very excellent cook. Huh. Well, how about giving these beans the benefit of your talents? I'll do nothing to help you. I'm your prisoner, and since you seem to want me with you, you'll take care of me. Want you? We just had an attack of insanity and decided to keep you from committing suicide. Very bad idea, come to think of it. Hey! You're forgettin' our guest of honor. Thank you, Mr. hoolihan. - Hey. Gimme. Come on, gimme. - Hmm? Say, uh, Mrs. Blake, if I ain't too inquisitive, what was you and your old man gonna do up here? Work. Oh. Looking for the yellow stuff, en? Probably. Can't understand it, a guy taking his wife way out in the wilderness. Stupid, if you ask me. Mr. Blake had an excellent reason. Yeah? Yeah. He loved me and I loved him. Well, I wouldn't let him go alone. Undoubtedly, that will still impress you as being a very stupid reason. We thought it an excellent one. I still think it's stupid. Have some coffee. It might warm you up. Well, tell me somethin'. Uh, didn't he have some object? Wasn't there somethin' he was after? What I mean is, did he have a hunch, or did somebody give him a tip? I'm very tired, Mr. hoolihan, and I know you must be. Me, tired? Heck no! Well, I thought you might be, asking such personal questions. - Good night. - Good night. Boss, she's a woman in a million. You think so? Yeah. She don't talk. Ohl can that be rain? Hey, I gotta admit though, she's pretty as a picture. You can have my share. He'll come back again. Well, let's turn in, huh? Do you mind putting another log on the fire, Mr. Thornton? Fire! Wolf! What's the matter? You woke up. Go on back to bed. Them beans I et... Thank you, Mr. Thornton. "Oh, thank you, Mr. Thornton." Say, you know, there's two of them dogs still missing, buck and the gray boy. Yeah. Speaking of the devil! Where you been? Shorty: Uh-huh. He's been in a fight with the gray boy, I bet you. Yeah, that means we're one dog short. I'm telling you, buck is an outlaw. I've known horses like that, never could break them. Well, what are we going to do for our lead dog? One eye has got a lot of experience. Move him to the lead. Come on, Bobby, let's start walking. Come on, buck. Buck, come on! Come herel come here! What's the matter with you? Success has gone to his noodle. Maybe he wants to ride on the sled. Shut up, will you? Buck, come here! If you had any common sense, Mr. Thornton, you'd realize what was wrong? As the intellectual member of this party, suppose you tell me. Very well, I will. Buck has whipped the lead dog and he now naturally believes that position belongs to him. That's the old law of accession. "The king is dead, long live the king." That is if you know what I am talking about. Oh, I see you're afraid to try my suggestion. Put one eye back in his old place. Come on. I'm crawling up my back, one eye. Come here. All right. Come on, king, and get crowned. Well, come on! The lead is yours! Perhaps that great but frigid mind of yours can figure out what's the matter now. That club, stupid. It takes some people an awful long time to catch on, doesn't it, buck? He meant that as a caress, didn't he? Yes, he did. I got to hand it to you, he's never done that to anybody else but me. It appears that you are I are the only members of the buck fraternal... Seems she'd rather be an elk. All right, get on with the dogs. No, thank you. I'll cross the way you men do. Hold on! Hold on! Stick with it! Hurry up! Hurry up! Don't forget the gun! If we pack the stuff on the dogs and foot it, we can make it to Dawson in three days. Oh, just a mad cook's tour, huh? Yeah. You better come closer to the fire, we won't bite, you know. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait till I put on my pants. All right, you win, Mr. Thornton, it is stupid for a woman to come up here. May 1? Yeah, sure. They usually get along better when they do as they're told. I wouldn't presume to teach you feminine psychology, but I might add, very humbly of course... Yeah? That if a woman is asked to do something, she's more apt to obey than when she's commanded. Are my stockings dry, Mr. hoolihan? It'll take a minute, I'll wring them out again and see. Does that answer your question? Look it, she's laughing! The ice has thawed. Spring has came! Oh, springtime, you hear people scream you're the one who's breaking my heart, you pretty thing a boo, a boo, a boo Springtime is here, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho boo. Boo. Boo. Say! Nice, modest little prices they have here. They practically give things away. Say, boss, how much we got this side of the grave? Just about enough for a room in a poorhouse. This mansion over here'll do. Come on. - Come on, buck. - Come on, buck. Well, Mrs. Blake, I guess it's about time to say good-bye. There's an officer of the mounted police down the street. They'll get you back to the states. We'd stake you ourselves, only, well, we've mislaid our funds. Yeah, yeah. Well, you've been very nice, Mr. Thornton. I suppose I was a little difficult, but, well, losing someone you've grown to love isn't... Yes, I know. I'm sorry I was so rough. Well, I'm sorry I was so unpleasant. Mmm. I'm sorry that I can't think of a thing to be sorry about. Ohl I suppose you've got friends and relatives back in the states. No. My husband's all I had. - Why do you ask? - Because we got a proposition to make. Yes? We know what brought you up here. We've known all along. I mean, old man Blake's claim. But how? How could you possibly know? Give me that map, shorty. Shorty: Yeah. Did you ever see this? Or, uh, something like it? Yes. Yes, I've seen the original. This won't do you any good. It isn't correct. I know it. That's why I was going to suggest that... My husband had to borrow and beg to make this trip. He went through all sorts of horrible difficulties and... I know. Well, now he's gone. That's why I was going to suggest that... And you were gonna take it away from him, steal it. Oh, now, please be reasonable. Why don't you come in with me and shorty on this thing? Where our map is incorrect, give us the right route. We'll be partners. And, well, while you're about it, I suppose you may as well consider all angles. We need your information about this. We could probably find the mine ourselves without your help. It would take longer. Of course, you don't know us very well, except that we're a little rough on women. We might play you dirty. We might take your information and then tell you to, well, go jump in the river. We might do that. On the other hand, we might be on the up-and-up with you. Let me see your map. This river here, it isn't a river, it's a dry creek. - And that mountain peak, that's down here. - Criminy! That's it! Ha! All the other mistakes are minor ones. All right, Mr. Thornton, now you can tell me... How did you express it? To go jump in the river? We've gotta do a lot of jumping ourselves to get the 700 bucks for the outfit. - Seven hundred dollars is hard to get. - My, oh, my, oh, my. But we'll get it, if we have to take a knife, stick somebody and take it away from 'em. - Yeah! - Come on, shorty. Mush! Come on. Let's go. “All set. Keep your fingers crossed till we get back. We've gotta make a touch, shorty. Something that means more to me now that just finding a mine. Yeah, I been noticing that. You're the doctor. You know what's good for ya. The way I figures it, hunting for gold's a full-time job. Anything that interferes with it, interferes with it. - What do you mean? - You know what I mean. Mind keeping that fat snoot of yours out of my affairs? All right, all right. No offense, boss. No offense whatsoever. - Where's buck? - Hmm? Come on! My, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my! Can't you see that's poisoned meat? That's the second time he's attacked me! Yeah, he's crazy about you! Can't you see? Wait a minute, partner. I'll give you a chance to make some money. - I doubt it. - I'll give you $300 for him. Hal - five hundred. Nope. Not interested. I'll give you $1,000! That's a fabulous price to pay for a dog. I could get a team of six for that. What do you expect you'd do with him if I let you have him? Give myself the exquisite pleasure of putting a bullet through his head. Yeah, that's what I thought. No, thanks. I'm sorry I can't contribute to your fun, mister. Boo! What'll you have to drink, gentlemen? Well, Jack, my boy, how is tricks? Hello, Sam! How are you? Glad to see you. Sam, this is shorty. - Hello. - Ah, yes! Just seen the argument you had with that fellow back there. - He doesn't seem to like your dog. - No, no. The dog doesn't like him either. Look, Sam, how you fixed? Uh, pretty nearly flat. But anyhow, I got enough to ask you gentlemens to join me in a drink. - Bourbon, straight! - Ditto! Likewise! Come on, boy! Come on! Schnapps? Well, Sam, here's to your very good health. - Skoal. - Prosit. You know, that's a lot of money that fellow offered you for your dog. Yeah? That's a lot of dog too. Sam: Jal - Hey, boss, let's head for the hotel, huh? - No, no, no, not yet. Maybe somebody we know will show. Ole! Ha-ha! How are you? I got lots trouble. Nowhere I can get two dogs, cheap. What matter, huh? I got load of thousand-pound flour I got to get over to 40-mile creek. Two of my dogs, they die. It's too big load for the other four dogs to pull. Quiet, now! Yo! That's one fine dog, mister! You want to sell, maybe? - No, I don't. - I'll say he don't! You know, that fellow back there just offered him 1,000 bucks. - One thousand bucks? - Mm-hmm. What the dog do? Spit gold dust? He's the best dog you've ever seen. He could pull that load of yours without any help at all. - Sure! I'll bet you he could. - Well, he could. How'd you like to make a little bet on that, partner? Haven't any money to bet. I hear of one dog in nome, he pull 800 pound. But he dies dead to do that. Ah, no dog can pull 1,000 pounds. It's impossible. Well, then it's impossible. Let's drop it. Is it all right to look at him, mister? It ain't every day we can see a dog that can pull a thousand pounds. Come on, boss. Let's get outta here. What's the matter, gentlemen? If I overheard correctly, the argument is whether or not this dog can pull a thousand pounds. I'm willing to bet a dollar a pound he can't. He won't bet. Says he's broke. I don't want money from you, my friend. If your dog is able to do it, I'll give you the $1,000. If he can't... well? Why, then, I'll take the dog. No. Man: Say, that sounds fair to me. Mister, you wouldn't want to own a dog that couldn't pull a measly thousand pounds. Sounds like an easy way of making money to me. Sure! First he shoots off his mouth. Then he won't go through with it. Well, my friend, these gentlemen seem to think I'm giving you the best of it. Don't do it, boss. Let's go outta here. A thousand dollars. It's a bet! It's a bet! I think you make one big mistake, mister. But, well, we go outside. - Thornton's crazy! - If Jack says his dog can do it, he can do it! - Ten-to-one he can't! - It's a bet! - Any more takers? - I'll take yal - I got a poke that says you're wrong. - I'm right! - But it dies dead to do that. - The dog will do it! Gee, boss, he can't do it. He'll kill himself trying. Shut up. You're not only doing this for money. You're afraid of getting stuck here and losing that Blake woman. Oh, all right. Your dog is to pull the sled a hundred yards from the standstill. That's the bet. A hundred yards! All right, all right! One, two, three, four... Shorty: All right, get back. Nobody touch that dog. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, one, two... Dog is gonna draw a sled. Just stand there. The dog will do it! It's plenty load for one dog to pull. The dog will do it! Five, six, seven, eight, nine... Keep your hands off that dog, now! You understand? Oh, I beg your pardon. Seven, eight, nine, a hundred. Go on, mister. We're waiting. Buck. Buck! Buck! Come on, boy! Come on, buck! Mush! Come on, boy! Mush, buck! Come on, come on, buck! - Come on, boy. - Stay away from that dog! Buck, come on! Buck! Come on, boy! Come on, whitey! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Hooray! That dog done it. - He all right? - Hope so. Oh, I beg your pardon, old boy, but haven't you forgotten about the money? The gelt? Please. Mmm! Thank you, sir. Oh, say. You know something? Well? You'd make a good dog biscuit. What's that, a halter? Yeah. Hmm. Being as I'm working like a horse, I just as well look like one. There you are. Now hang on to this. Is that all? Did you remember nails? Nails. Hammers and saw. Look. You bought 'em yourself. What's the matter with you this morning? - Nothing. Get out. - Mmm. Oh, hey, listen... There's something we did forget, a medicine kit. We need some iodine and quinine, just in case. Yeah, all right. I'll get 'em. Hmm. I hope it won't be too heavy for you to carry. - See youse later. - Claire: All right. Say, uh, what do we need the nails and hammers for? Well, the snow's disappearing fast. We'll have to cache the sled later on and build a boat. Oh? Say, uh, look... Yeah? What is it? L, uh... I got something to tell you. Maybe you better take it sitting down. You know how I feel about women in this country. Where we're going is ten times as tough and rugged - as anything you've seen up to now. - What are you getting at? Well, just this. I paid your room rent here at the hotel and ['ll leave you enough money for expenses until we get back. You mean I'm supposed to wait here while you and shorty go... That's it. I've been wondering whether you'd try something like this. Well, if you're going, I'm going too. - You mean you don't trust us? - I mean exactly that. All right, shorty and I will stay here. You go find the mine. - Oh, don't be smart. - Well, you're not going. Wouldn't be fair to you, or to us either. Slow us down to a walk and make us carry double provisions. Besides, it's more of a risk than I want to see you take. Believe me, that's my only reason for making this decision. If you don't like my way of doing it, do it yourself. You can have my share. Oh, so you're gonna give me my mine, are you? Well, thank you very much. You'll not leave this town without me. We'll leave without you. You'll wait here and like it. All right, come on. Let's get going. - How about the iodine and quinine? - I'll get them. If that female iceberg comes out and wants to tag along, smack her down. Wonder what's happened now. Oh, well. You know, I know a couple of people used to fool around like that and they got children now. You, uh... you still want to go along? Not only do I still want to go, I am going. All right, come on. Let's get going. Jack: Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on! Hey! Hey! Come on! Mush! Mush! Mush! - What's up, sergeant? - They just brought a fellow in. - Picked him up on the skagway trail. - What happened to him? It seems like he left his sled to go hunting for food then couldn't find his way back. He was almost a corpse when they found him. - What's his name? - Well, we found these on him. Name seems to be Blake, John Blake, San Francisco. Here it comes. Say, it even looks like a raft. Thanks. I always wanted to join the Navy. - Will there be room for the dogs, sailor? - I'm afraid not, Matey. - They'll have to run along the bank. - Very well, sir. Be careful of that varnish on the deck, you two gobs. Step right in, commodore. Claire: All set? Shove off, cabin boy. Ca... Toot, toot! Shorty: Hard aport! Jack: Come on, buck. Come on. The way I figure it, we go 100 miles upstream then we follow a creek that runs into it north. Huh! Never fails. Oh, you pretty things. That's right, north for about 40 miles. And then all we gotta do is... Oh, if you could only cook. Then all we have to do is find the knoll upon which stands a tree, half-shattered by lightning. And the cabin. Near that knoll. Gee, I wonder what it's gonna be like, having things instead of wishing for 'em. Hmm. Not nearly so much fun. You're wrong, Claire. Wishing never got anybody anyplace. It's owning something that counts. Taking it when you can't get it any other way, that's all right too. It's the law up here. The law of the klondike. When there's something you need, grab it. Take it away from the other guy. It's a good law. It works. Nope. It only works when you deserve to have what you take. Otherwise it's stealing. Perhaps that particular commandment isn't respected up here. They all get broken. That one gets splintered. Well, Noah, that boat manipulating's a little too tough for my delicate constitution, so if you don't mind, sir, I shall go below. Good night. - Night, shorty. - Night. Good night, dice. Summer's just around the corner. I can smell it. You know, somehow Dawson and skagway and even California seem like places I've just heard of. Seems as if I've lived out here in this wilderness forever. Other people and other places never existed. But there's one thing I do remember, and that's a very kind and wonderful man. I wonder what buck sees in the fire. What are you thinking of, buck? Well, he's probably remembering more than thinking. Remembering back to the time when he was more wolf than dog. When there was only one law, the law we were just talking about. It's getting late, Jack. Think I'll say good night. Not guilty, your honor. Cabin! - The tree! - The mine! Oh, boy! Hey, somebody pinch me. That does it. It's just as it was in the letter. My, oh, my, oh, my. I do declare. Hey! Hey, boss! Boss! Come here, quick. Hmm. Look at this. Oh, my. Oh. Lookit, lookit! Tell me if I'm dreamin'. Lookit. Holy mackerel. It's gold, Claire. More gold than I've ever seen in my whole life. Ohl oh, be careful! It ain't gonna rain no more, no more it ain't gonna rain no more I've got gold in my head it ain't gonna rain no more Hey, if we panned this much in an afternoon think what we'll get in a month. Gee, I wish I could stick around here a couple of days longer. You know, I been dreamin' of this moment all my life. I'm sorry, shorty, but you got to file a claim. As long as the trails are open, some prospector is apt to discover this creek. First to register gets discovery rights. You're the boss, boss. When I get to Dawson, first thing I'm gonna do... Don't. - Don't what? - Get drunk. Not a chance. I'm gonna catch up on my meals. I like coffee, and my stomach's been getting weaker every day. Well, so long, kid. - Don't spend it all in one place. - So long. Well, good-bye, Mrs. Blake. Good-bye, shorty. Come on, dogs. Jack: Hey! Hey, shorty! “What? You forgot your meal ticket. Oh! Oh, yeah. Come to papa. Snake eyes. My, oh, my, oh, my. I do declare. Well, good-bye. - Good-bye. - Bye. It ain't gonna rain no more, no more it ain't gonna rain no more I've got gold in my head it ain't gonna rain no more it ain't gonna rain no more, no more it ain't gonna rain no more I've got gold in my head it ain't gonna rain no more What's the matter, boy? Buck! Buck! - What's biting him? - I don't know. What's that, Jack? “Wolves. That's funny. They don't usually come so close to camp. Buck! Come here! Buck, come back here! If that's a pack, they'll kill him. Buck, come here! Jack: Buck! He's been changing lately. Haven't you noticed? Seems as though he remembers things up here. Buck, come back here! Buck! Buck! Buck, come here! Well, well. Welcome, stranger. How are ya? Huh? Well, seems we still mean more to him than that old memory. Yeah. Hey, hey, wait a minute. You better come inside before you change your mind. Come on, tough guy. Come on. All right, kid, shake it up. Shake it up. Oh, that's grand music. Yes. That's grand music. Jack: Aw, that's grand music. Yeah. That's grand music. That's lovely. Come on. Shake it up. All right. You tired? Hmm? All right, come on now. Let's pull. Together. One, two, - three... - Oh! Well, we weren't together. - Oh, I wish you hadn't. - Why not? I haven't let myself think about us. - L1 didn't dare. - Why? Oh, I don't know. I... I've had sort of a strange premonition. I don't know exactly how to explain it, but... Explanations belong 5,000 miles away. I only have one question, and I only want one answer. You know the answer. I don't want to know the answer. I want to have the answer. It just struck me, Mr. Blake. Now my back please, Kali. I say, Mr. Blake, it's just struck me that so far I've taken this entire matter on trust. I believed your story and put up the money for this outfit. I still believe your story, but I think it's time you gave me a little more positive proof. You should show us the map, Mr. Blake. When I asked you in Dawson city to help finance me I told you I knew the location of a very rich mine. I still know where that mine is. I'm taking you there. But the map, Mr. Blake... Why do you continually refuse to show us the map? I see. Well, what's to prevent our taking it away from you? The possibility that such a map may not exist, except in my memory. Violence will do you no good. You've come this far and now there's nothing you can do but go all the way. You'll gain nothing by killing me. Now, now. Who talked of killing? We're not pirates, my dear man. We are gentleman adventurers on the road to great riches, eh? Come, come, Kali. My towel. Say, Jack. - Buck's gone again. - Yes, I know. - I heard his lady friend howling last night. - Oh? Well, that's what happens to a fella when he gets in bad company. Mmm! Wait a minute. According to all you told us, and to all calculations, we should have located the mine two days ago. I'm afraid you're bringing out my worst side, Mr. Blake. - Yes, I know, but... - If you're trying to hoodwink us, we are certain to find it out sooner or later, and if such is the case, there is nothing left for us to do but mourn for you. I swear I'm doing the best I can. I followed the compass directions exactly. Blake: The burnt tree! - The cabin! That's it! - My dear Mr. Blake, how can you ever forgive me for doubting your integrity? You've placed me in a most embarrassing position. I scarcely know what to say. One for the master. And one for the dame. And one for the little boy who's filing the claim. Why, Jack, I never suspected. The world doesn't understand me. At heart I'm an artist. Oh, I want to write poetry. I want to compose. I want to sing, paint. - Barns? - Yes, yes. Those too. I want to starve in a garret. Wear me hair long. Get egg on a flowing tie. In other words, be a genius. Ah... but no. No, the world sneers at me talent, and instead it gives me gold. Oh, my poor boy. You seem to have all the comforts of home, Mr. Thornton... A comfortable cabin, golden evidence of more comforts to come, and a beautiful lady. You will oblige me greatly if you will assist in making this incident as painless as possible. Come on, get it over with. What are you going to do? Do? My dear man, nothing at all. The important thing is... We're going back by water, Kali, using Mr. Thornton's canoe. You may destroy our burros. As I was saying, the important thing is to prevent you people from filing claim on this charming site before we do. And how do you expect to do that? Oh, very easily, by leaving you here and destroying all means of transportation. If you can't get back to Dawson to file, why, then you can't get back to Dawson to file, now can you? So we'll file instead. If you want to work the mine while we're gone, you're very welcome to do so, of course. We'll be glad to recompense you for your trouble when we get back. Meanwhile we'll take with us your gun and ammunition, axes, et cetera. It would be a grave error to leave behind the implements for building another canoe, wouldn't it? Kali! Francois! Kali! Come herel look here, Smith. Why can't we do business? I'm always open to an honest proposition, Mr. Thornton. We'll give you the claim, all of it. You can have what gold we've got. But leave us some way of getting out of here. The winter snows are coming on. My dear man, you call that a business proposition? We already have the mine, and the gold is ours by right of... How shall I put it? By right of conquest. Do you mind if we don't argue the point anymore? Let's help ourselves. Mr. Thornton would only squander the gold. I must commend your sense of humor, Mr. Thornton. Very few people would be able to smile on an occasion like this. - Thank you. - Not at all. I remember watching a magician once. From an apparently empty hat, he shortly produced a rabbit. He smiled very much as you're smiling now, because, I imagine, he knew all the while, that he had that rabbit up his sleeve. You've something up your sleeve, perhaps. Perhaps. Roll up your sleeve, Mr. Thornton. There's no rabbit there. Come, come. Don't let's strain our friendship. Madam. Careful, you idiot. You might have split the bottom. We'll be back, my friends. For the time being, good-bye, and good-bye. Look out! Well, they wanted gold. Now they got it. Hey, Claire, get the medicine kit and some hot water. Is he badly hurt? Yeah. He's got a nasty crack on the skull. Some prospector, I guess. Go away, buck. Get out of the way. John! John! Oh, John. John, darling! Claire, dearest, I'd like to talk to Mr. Thornton. All right, dear. I thought I'd lost you. Try to rest, please. He's feeling much better this morning. He remembers everything, thank heaven. It wasn't so serious as we thought. He wants to see you, Jack. What are you going to say to him? I wanted you and I took you with us. Well, I'm keeping you. Jack. You know I love you, don't you? You couldn't doubt that, could you? Well, he needs me. You have your law and I have mine. Best thing you can do, Blake, is to get out of here as quick as you can. You need medical attention. Take the canoe. It's easy going now, but it won't be when the heavy snows come on. Will you come with us? No, I'll stay here and work the mine. When you come back in the spring, we'll divide what I've found. I came to say good-bye to buck. He never would have forgiven me if I'd forgotten that. Would you, buck? You could have skipped that. You're only making it tougher on everybody. Oh, Jack, put your arms around me. Well, I'll be seeing you. Yes. You'll be seeing me. I'll be seeing you too. Every day and every night and every minute. This isn't the end. It can't be. Careful of that first stretch of rapids. After that it's clear sailing. Good-bye, Thornton. And god bless you. Good-bye, Blake. Good-bye, Jack. Good-bye, Claire. It's hard to say no to that call, isn't it, buck? It's all right, boy. Go ahead. Shorty? - Yeah! - Shorty! - Hello, boss! - Why, you old son of a gun. You came just in time. You saved my life. Well, look at you. You're all dressed up. Yeah. We're in the money. I filed the claim. We're rich. Richer than astor's pup! No trouble at all. I went right in and signed the names. - Oh, and the claim was... - Shorty. What's that? That's our new cook. - Where'd you get it? - I won it in a crap game.
