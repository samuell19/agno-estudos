Mormonism was everything to me 'cause my parents had been divorced, and I felt like the church took care of me and nurtured me when my family was falling apart. In 2009, I started a PhD in clinical and counseling psychology. I was just noticing all these LGBT Mormons that were depressed and suicidal, and, um... the church was encouraging mixed orientation marriages, where you're gay, but you marry a straight person. I am a Mormon. I'm a father of six children, and I am attracted to men. The attractions aren't gonna go away. They're gonna be there my whole life, but I don't feel that I'm losing anything in my life. To me, that's being authentic, is it's finding that core happiness within you. And for me, it's important that that core happiness is aligned with my beliefs in the gospel. That know that I'm gay, I'm able to be myself. And I'm not having to make up excuses of why I'm not dating or I'm not married or I'm not falling in love. What's been so great about this experience is that I've been able to understand what really makes me happy, and that is pleasing God. So, we decided to study, uh, what decisions led to healthy outcomes for LGBT people, and what decisions led to unhealthy outcomes. ♪ ♪ I just wanted to understand a couple things. Can you change being gay or lesbian if you try? What happens if you just try to be celibate? What happens if you just try and marry a woman? Mixed orientation marriages were a disaster. Celibacy was the worst possible option that they could have chosen. Uh... Hundreds and hundreds of the people mentioned suicide in their narratives, of wanting to kill themselves because of the struggle. Feeling like God didn't love 'em, that God wouldn't heal them, and so they must have been beyond God's love and power. We've seen the suicide rates of youth between the ages of 15 and 19 double in the past two to three years, and triple over the past eight or nine years since 2008. Nowhere else in the entire United States are we seeing youth suicide rates double and triple over that same time period. And so, what's the cause? What happened in 2007, 2008? It was when the predominant religion within the state of Utah declares war on LGBT people. Today, I'd like to explain how I became an LGBT ally as a Mormon. I gave a TED Talk in, uh, 2013. I want to begin by making a point. That you can literally save the lives of your LGBT brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, through love. Well, I gave the TED Talk in, like, October or November, 2013, and by January or February of 2014, my bishop had called me in, and, uh, told me he was starting an investigation into my membership. And in February of 2015, I was excommunicated from the church. Hmm. There's no doubt in my mind that my public support of LGBT people was a major factor in my excommunication. Excommunication is about the worst thing that a Mormon could ever experience. It basically means, from a religious perspective, that you're cut off from your family for all of eternity. That your family's gonna go to this really nice place in heaven, and you're gonna be alone, uh, in a dark, sad place, and that's what excommunication means. It means you can't participate in church. It's basically condemning you to the Mormon equivalent of hell. And it was... But more than that, it's cutting you off from your tribe. It's cutting you off from your people, from your friends, from your family. Uh, I have family members that won't speak to me. Um, and it's... devastating. Oh, man. Uh... My family is all Mormon, and they're very active. I have a... I have a real fear of losing all that. Maybe you've heard the quote, um, "The only thing required for evil to persist is for good men to do nothing." You've probably heard that, right? I have. Yeah. I've always loved the church. I still do. I still consider myself Mormon. Um... and so... But I felt the same way you did. I didn't want to leave it. I didn't want to be excommunicated. I do think the number of overt bigots out there, as a percentage, is really small, but the number of, of Mormons, frankly, who just have decided to remain silent is extremely large.

Adultery, fornication, committing homosexual acts, and other deviations approaching these in gravity, are not acceptable alternate lifestyles. They are serious sins.

So when the church make statements in the '80s and '90s and 2000s that to be gay is evil, that to be in a same-sex, uh, marriage or committed relationship is evil, they're not just saying that as their own opinion. They're basically saying that God speaks to the leader of our church and takes that position. As the church has seen in the past, when the church takes a position, and then the rest of the nation changes, so in the late 1800s, the church was a polygamous church, and the rest of the nation wasn't cool with that, uh, the church was almost destroyed, and so, the church had to change. Fast-forward to the 1960s, the whole United States is starting to support African-Americans and civil rights. And the LDS church is opposing, um, the civil rights movement and that almost destroyed the church. And so in 1978, the church changes again.

Because you can say, I love you, all you want, but until you act on that in a way that feels inclusive and complete, then it's, it's a no-go. Like, it's a big step. It's historic that they're approving of anything, uh, LGBT related, but I don't know. I'm a little salty because there's still a policy intact, and it doesn't take away from everyone that, the pain that I went through. Like, that policy caused me to completely go through a faith crisis. I've, you know, had suicidality this last year. Like, I don't know where I fit in all the time, and that's because of them. It's a tiny step with the church. It's a huge step for this area. I'm the mother of a 17-year-old gay son that we lost to suicide a year ago. We work hard to spread the message of unconditional love for all of God's children, so heartbreaking stories... like mine won't happen again. This is a great message to parents to say, you know what? It is okay to love your gay kids. And I think the thing is kinda hitting me the most is, uh... ♪ ♪ I know Stockton is really proud. He's really proud. Yeah. He would be dancing.

How can we fix it? ♪ ♪ Leading up to LoveLoud, uh, the church obviously, reached out to me, and we have been having, kind of, an open dialogue. Coming out of LoveLoud, everybody was feeling positive momentum. I had been extremely excited for General Conference. And general conference happens twice a year. It's where the apostles, and the prophets speak, uh, like on live television to the world, and to all the Mormons. And I think a lot of Mormons, myself, were waiting to hear an apostle say, now let's start to do something to change this. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are blessed with unique doctrine and different ways of viewing the world. We've witnessed a rapid and increasing public acceptance of cohabitation without marriage and same-sex marriage. Which is basically an old piece that was put together from the church that was released about marriage is between a man and a woman, and these are the things that make up a good, healthy family. The Family Proclamation begins by declaring that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God, and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of his children. It also affirms that gender is an essential characteristic of individual, premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose. Doubled down on everything they've been pounding into my head, and Mormons' heads for years, which is to be gay, and act upon it, is a sin. Marriage is between man and a woman. Popular culture, popular people will try to tell you otherwise. And its chance to stand and prove itself. I believe our attitude toward, and use of the Family Proclamation, is one of those tests for this generation. I pray for all Latter-day Saints to stand firm in that test. In light of LoveLoud, that, for me, was a dark day to say the least. It's a dark week, a dark month. If there's one thing my Mormon values have taught me since I was young... ♪ First things first ♪ ♪ I'ma say all the words inside my head ♪ ♪ I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been ♪ ♪ Oh... ♪ It's that no matter what the world says about who you are, what you believe, still do it, 100 percent. That spirit was the spirit that carried me through my mission. I felt like I was bearing my truth, regardless of what anybody thought about me. That's all because of Mormonism and my parents, and so they have all prepped me for this moment now. ♪ Pain, you made me a, you made me a believer ♪ ♪ Believer ♪ ♪ Pain, you break me down, you build me up, believer ♪ ♪ Believer ♪ I will tell you that.

It gave me the guts to talk about my son's sexuality in ways that I had never been able to before. I've had four people come out to me since LoveLoud. They said that LoveLoud gave them the courage to live their truth. LoveLoud gave me the opportunity to tell my story, and declare that I am worth it in front of thousands of people. LoveLoud gave my family the chance to stand shoulder to shoulder with our transgender son. And not only him, but with neighbors and extended family, who never would have ever shown up for an LGBT event. LoveLoud gave me hope, and inspiration that things can change. That I, myself, can be a force for good in my own community. Looking at this crowd of thousands of people, I realize these are people I don't have to be scared of. There's a lot of support in my community that I didn't realize was there, and it was honestly one of the best days of my life. When I was 13, 14, I felt completely isolated and silenced, and it hasn't even been that long, and I just feel so hopeful about the future, and that things will just keep getting better, and... I hope it does. ♪ I keep skipping stones ♪ ♪ Hoping for a change ♪ ♪ But, things just stay the same ♪ ♪ I keep walking roads ♪ ♪ Looking for the home ♪ ♪ That I can call my own ♪ ♪ Skipping stones ♪ ♪ I'm ♪ ♪ Skipping stones ♪ ♪ I'm ♪ ♪ Skipping stones ♪ ♪ I'm ♪ ♪ Skipping stones ♪ ♪ Skipping stones ♪ ♪ I'm ♪ ♪ Skipping stones ♪ ♪ I'm ♪ ♪ Skipping stones ♪ ♪ I'm ♪ ♪ Skipping stones ♪ It just comes, and none knows whence.
