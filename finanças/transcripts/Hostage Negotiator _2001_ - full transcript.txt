Now feed the cake to Frank. Ready? Mmm, good. Who's that? : Stacey. Stacey. Hey, Theresa... I love you. And here we are in the brand-new Foley house. Ah-ha. Wait, wait, wait. Pick that back up and read that. No. Don't be so shy. "Theresa M. Foley, Special Agent "Graduate, Hostage Negotiation Course FBI Academy, Quantico, Virginia." What's the first thing you're going to negotiate? Hmm... ...some private time? What's he saying, Victor? That's what I want. Victor, what's he saying? Nickey, shut your mouth, all right?! Just shut it and let me talk to this guy! Listen, pig, I'm not telling you again, you underst...? Victor, he's moving. He's moving, Victor. What'd I tell you, huh? I told you to keep your head on the ground, didn't I? Didn't I? Victor, Victor, maybe we should answer it. Just lift it up one inch. Victor... Danny, what's the situation? Two suspects armed, six hostages. Casualties? Not yet. Contact? When I arrived, one suspect was on the phone with the local police captain. He requested a ride to the airport, a private plane two parachutes, a pack of cigarettes. Cigarettes? What kind? : Didn't ask. Find out. Uh, can't. Officer told me it was crazy didn't go over too well-- no contact since. All right, I want everyone on the ground, now! Move it! Move your ass now! Move, move! What, are you stupid? Move! Keep it down, keep it down! We'll shoot you! We'll shoot you! HNT has been notified. Foley's the closest negotiator in the area. She's the best, sir. When you look at my record, I think it's clear that I've dedicated my life to the Bureau and I think you'll agree that... ...ah, hell. When you look at my record I think it's indisputable that I've... That I've... Honey, what are you doing? You okay? I got... pulled off the investigation. That's three in a row, Theresa. Three. Hi, Daddy. Hi, Stacey-Bug. I'm making a bad pumpkin. Really? Let me see this here. : Oh, yeah... I think I arrested that guy once for extortion. Excellent job. Kind of intricate. He give you a reason? Yeah... Penfield said, uh, I wasn't a team player. "Team player"? I've been with the Bureau for nine years. I mean, what do they...? You know... Just let the machine get it. Anyway, it's my problem, Theresa. I don't want you getting involved, okay? Foley. Mommy, look at the face I'm drawing. Mine's better than yours-- look, Mom. It's for you, it's Daniels. You understand? No. Yes, I think so. Look at me. What do you think they're thinking out there? I don't know. You know. Come on, I know you know. Answer me. They're everywhere, Victor, I don't know. I know you know! Answer me. You know! They're everywhere, Victor. I'll tell you what-- nothing! They're not thinking anything, 'cause they don't know what the hell we're going to do next, you understand?! You follow me?! We got to keep them wondering. We got to be unpredictable, Nickey... till I figure out what to do. So, how is my favorite ex-partner? Danny. Hey. Hey. When did you transfer back? Last month. Yeah? So, who's on the team? I'm tactical supervisor. Alexander is field commander. You are primary negotiator. Foley, it's about time. We just got wired in to the phone grid. Then let's light him up. Shouldn't we answer that, Victor? It's driving me nuts, Victor, come on. Stay on them! Can I at least answer one of them, please? All right. You want to answer it, answer it. You're driving me crazy. Hey, what's wrong with you? This guy looks like he's dying, here. Foley's our intelligence officer. You know Stark from SWAT. Can you give me some kind of timetable, Foley? My men are in position. Ease up, Stark. Why don't you take a seat and watch me work? Pickup on line three. Hello, this is FBI agent, Theresa Foley. Who am I speaking with? Uh, Nick... Nickey Larson. No, no, no! What are you doing?! You don't tell her your name, you idiot! I'm sorry, Victor... No! Give me the phone! Nickey... you still with me? No, Nickey lost his phone privileges! I see. You must be Victor. I'm Theresa... Theresa Foley. We got a problem, Victor. No, you got a problem! This is Channel 7 news reporting live from downtown. The botched robbery attempt turned into a stand off during what is commonly known as the "after-lunch lull." Now, only a few minutes ago, the suspects released one of their six hostages in exchange for food, water and cigarettes. Where the hell are my cigarettes? She promised me smokes. I'm scared. We're not gonna go to jail. I don't want to go to jail. All right, Nickey? We're not going to go to jail. Find my cigarettes, will you? Victor just found the cigarettes. Get ready for a phone call in three... two... one. Here we go, line five. Are you guys screwing with me? There's no matches! I swear to God, I am gonna start shooting somebody in two minutes if I don't get my matches, you hear me?! Okay, Victor, I'm sorry. You didn't mention matches. We thought you had some. I can get some for you. Get 'em! When's Mommy going to come home? Mm... probably pretty late. But she'll be okay, honey. I bet those guys are crazy. Sometimes they're just, uh... ...confused, Stacey, and they... they get into a situation, and they can't get out of it and I guess they panic. But Mommy helps them out. Yeah, she does. Okay. Tuck in. I'll cover you up. Good night. Okay. I love you. What the hell are they doing? They're using the desks to build a little fort in the center of the bank. Look at that. Theresa sent the matches. All right, Nickey, let one of them out but not the guard. That-that guy over there. Him. Someone's coming out. Unit one, go. My snipers are in position. Let me in this now. What do you think, Theresa? I think I've already gotten two hostages released without anyone being hurt. I think I'd like to keep it that way. And besides, we still don't know what Victor wants. He wants an airplane, parachute, and some damn matches. The guy thinks he's D.B. Cooper. Hand it over, Foley, my turn. Not yet. Ring line three. Stay on him. Go ahead. How are my hostages doing, Victor? : Oh.... I don't know. What do you think? I think you got quite a sheet here. That's the story of my life, honey-- quantity, not quality. Yeah, well, it's your two, uh, felony convictions that got me worried. You understand, what you're doing, Victor is going to amount to strike three. That's the problem isn't it? You're a smart lady. You bet it's a problem, 'cause I'm not going to grow old and rot in that cage, you hear me? All right, let's talk about it. Now, maybe I could, uh... get you a good lawyer this time around. You know, not a hack P.D. but a class attorney who could... get a judge to maybe reconsider a previous conviction... take away a strike, you know? I can make this happen... if you trust me. What do you say, Victor? What do I say? What do I say?! Everybody stand by. What the hell is going on? Did that get your attention? You know, the guard's a little sick. I think he wants to talk to you. Say something now! Can't breathe. In five minutes, people are going to start dying unless I get a cop car with you behind the wheel to take me to the airport. You understand? You do that... and everybody goes free. It's up to you. Off-line. He's bluffing. I'm not going for that. Stark, 10-20 on your snipers. In position, but the perps are behind the desks. No clear shot yet. All right, you tell me when you have one. The guy's got high blood pressure. He's got irregular heart rhythm. Alex, I got to go in. No way. I'm giving it to Stark. What are you going to do, wait until the shot opens up? The guard could be dead. Alex, let me go in and make the exchange. I'll get the guard out; you'll get your shot. You want a gun? No. It'll be the first thing he'd check. Are you okay with this? Yeah. I'm just thinking about my kids. Theresa, let's not do it. Let's come up with a different plan. Great. You let me know when you think of it. Meantime... I'll be inside that bank. On target. Not yet, hold your fire. Here, she's here. She's brought the police car, just like she promised. Okay, we have three options now. Surrender, kill shot or crisis entry. All right, send them out. Someone's coming. Move, move, move, move! All right, get out of there, move! Move, go, go. Move it, go, go, go. Where's my bank guard, Nickey? There's something wrong with him. He won't get off the floor. What's she doing? Lost my shot. Holding. Hello, Theresa. Hello, Victor. Very nice. You know, if I only had a little more time under different circumstances... All right, you're going to keep your promise, you hear? You're going to drive us to the airport and that guard goes free, you got it? Let's go to the car, let's go. No. What? First I got to see the guard. Go, go. Give her one minute then I want a full breach. SWAT team, prepare for deployment. My man can get a shot. He's almost there, Alex. He gets a shot, he takes it. I'm Theresa Foley, FBI. How you doing, Mr. Goodwin? Pain... pain in my chest. How's that? There you go. Stay on it, Nickey. On target. Something bad's about to happen, Nickey. You want to save yourself? Come on, Nickey, you got to make a decision. What do I do? Why do they keep shining those damn lights? I can't breath. Hey, what the hell is going on? Down! Down! Quick, hit the floor. Hostage clear. Repeat, hostage clear. Go, go, go, go. You lied to me, Theresa. I'm not going to forget this. Okay. Got it. All right, you guys, I hear they have a moon... Hey, how's it going? Come on. Do you remember Alex's last barbecue? When you got roped into working the grill? And you looked all rugged in that apron? Oh, I liked that apron. What did it say on it? It said, um... "K-kiss the Chef," I think it said. Yeah, "Kiss the Chef," really... Kiss him right here I think is what it said. Something like that. You got a new assignment and everything is going to be just fine. Come on. Just about done. Hey, Foley. Over here. Hey, Alex. Can I interest you in a hamburger? Fair warning though-- sometimes my medium rare... Hey, how you feeling, Frank? Good. I'm good. Feeling good. They offered to make me Special Agent in charge of the Omaha office. But I think hostage negotiation gives me more visibility... Missing work these days? Nah. I'm working on a classified case right now. Oh, yeah? Yeah, what are you working on? Well, it's classified. If I revealed it, it wouldn't be classified, would it? How long you been with the Bureau? Hey, you should go take a look at the kids. They're having a great time. Everybody knows that I got fired. Oh, so what? It doesn't matter, honey. And you're still a good investigator. Maybe, I don't know. And you're also a wonderful father. And a great husband. But I don't know if you still know how to dance. Excuse me? You heard me. Oh, well, there's only one way to find out. And you mixed minced onion into the patty. Gentlemen. How you doing? Oh, it looks great. Right? She's going to love that. That's a total surprise, right? I hope so. I can't wait to see the look on her face. Maybe we should put it inside, or put it somewhere? You burning that stuff? Well, you know, some people like it well done. It's too bad we didn't meet at some nightclub. You could have danced over and swept me off my feet. Yeah, instead we had to go to that ridiculous seminar. What was it called? Sex Crimes and Serial Killers. Yes, very romantic. Uh, I, uh... I really hate to break this up but Theresa's wanted outside. Okay. Attention, please. I know you're all here to drink too much and do things we'll be embarrassed about tomorrow. But there really is a reason for this party. Theresa Foley is receiving a special commendation for her role in the bank siege. Plus, I just heard word that they want her to teach at Quantico. Thank you. Uh... I want to thank my ex-partner, Danny McBaine for backup, and, um... Welcome home. Listen, I, um... I got a call this morning. Victor Blake has been making some threats. He's been pretty vocal about you in particular. Blake can say whatever he wants as long as he says it with his butt behind bars. Let's go, Mom. Come on, let's go. All right. I'll see you later. Okay. The handcuffs, too. Nobody told me about that. All metal has to be removed. The MRI is basically a giant magnet. Any metal... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're going to have to step out, too while the machine's in operation. So, uh, if he'd had left them on and that machine ripped my arms off you think I could sue the government? Maybe. What happened to your leg? Lie on the tray. Easy, I'm going to lean on you a little. Boo. You know, we still got that bottle of champagne from your Uncle Vinny. We could put the kids to bed. You didn't tell me McBaine transferred back to Virginia. I didn't think it was a big thing. I didn't say it was a big thing. I said you didn't tell me. What are you doing? Uh, got a weapons buy at the storefront tonight. You didn't tell me. Well... didn't seem like a big thing. Yeah. So, how's the investigation going? It would be perfect if they left me alone let me do my thing. You know, story of my life. What's that supposed to mean? You tell me. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute, Frank. I'm on your side. Yeah, well, I thought the Bureau was on my side, too. I'm not talking about the Bureau. I'm talking about our marriage. What's the difference, Theresa? We met at the Academy, worked in the same office talked about the same cases. Hell, it's like sharing a religion. A religion I don't believe in anymore. Heads up, boys and girls. Our friend Ramsey Bates has just arrived. Okay, Frank. It's show time. All right, no problem. Yo, Ramsey, my man, what's happening, bro? Hey, man, so you got something for me or what? Nothing, Jack. Nada, zip. What do you mean nothing, man? Last weekend it was no problemo. You want a machine gun, I get you a machine gun. You want a case of grenades, pick a number. I mean, what's happening here, man? The National Guard's got too much security, Jack. What can I say? Well, you can say you're going to reel right around and spin your butt back over there and get me my machine guns, Ramsey. Hell. I said I'd look into it. I looked into it. You know what? I tell you what. How 'bout I get you some lock picks, huh? Yolanda, get in here right now. Frank's soliciting a crime. Make it easy for you to get through those doors, huh? Hi, you guys sell DVD players? What are you doing? Okay, that's funny. What are you doing here? What do you mean, what am I doing here? What are you doing? What the hell's going on here? Frank, are you out of your mind? You can't help someone break into a National Guard armory. Even you know that. That's entrapment. Chill out! What are you talking about? Chill out! Hey, man, I was just trying to make the case. Isn't that what we're supposed to be doing here? Arresting the bad guys, locking them up, huh? Well, stop looking at me. Okay, Frank, it's fine. Okay, you two it's way past your bedtime. Stacey, didn't you hear me? There's a man watching us. What are you talking about? Move out of the window. He's in the van across the street. FBI! Put your hands up! What are you doing, Frank? Nothing. I wanted to see what's going on when I'm not here. What?! Wh-what do you think is going on, Frank?! Theresa, wait a minute. Why won't Daddy let us go in the garage? He's working on a secret. What is it? If I told you, it wouldn't be a secret anymore. What are you doing in here? I'm looking for, uh, credit card receipts. I think we got billed twice. I'll get them for you later. I was working on them now. Look, I'm going to the marriage counselor I'm following all the rules, but this office is my space. I don't want you in here. Fine. Thank you. Hostage negotiation is based on something called "the rule of reciprocity" which is a fancy way of saying, you do something for me and I'll do something for you. Example: during a recent bank takeover I didn't include matches when the gunman asked for cigarettes. I ended up trading a hostage for a light. Example two: they ask you for food get them greasy burgers and double salt the fries. The hostage taker will get thirsty want another soda and you will have another thing to trade for. Okay. Theresa, we just got word. Uh, Victor Blake escaped from prison. We think he's looking for you. What? How do you know that? Prison informants told us he was making threats toward you. Before he escaped he was caught in the prison library using the computer to do an information search trying to track you down. How much did he find out? He's got your address. My address? Danny...! Theresa, we're on it. I have kids that ride on a school bus and play in the driveway. "On it" isn't good enough. What if he shows up? That's why I'm here. I'd like to offer you 24-hour protection starting immediately. Right. Frank would never go for that in a million years. We've been having some problems. We're seeing a marriage counselor. He doesn't trust me or the Bureau. Will you do me a favor? Please... Who is this one from? Is that mine? It's yours forever. I love you, Daddy. Look at that! Isn't that great? Please tell me that this is some kind of joke. It's evidence. Evidence? Of what? Frank, Danny and I met because Victor Blake escaped. He's looking for me. He knows where we live. You really expect me to believe that? W-what's going on here? What's wrong with you? Would you please stop what you are doing and look at me? Thank you. Now, this guy is out there and our children could be in danger. I know you won't allow 24-hour protection from the Bureau so, I told Danny... You're sleeping with him, aren't you? What?! I'll take that as a "yes." What is happening to us?! You got to help me out here, honey because the way you're acting... The way I'm acting? You're one to talk. Sneaking around behind my back, using these kids as an excuse so you can go out and do your little... Whoa. Now, that's enough. It's called pressure... and you are under a lot of it. Being reassigned and all. But you are not the first to feel it. I know it's been difficult. Oh, what do you know, huh?! Look at you, then look at me. You know absolutely nothing about what I'm feeling right now. I think you're right. Rex, leave whatever you are doing and report to the kitchen immediately. Our guest has a healthy appetite, Rex. I want you to see that he gets... You're losing my page. Are you guys ready for school yet? No. Well, come on, we're going to be late, slowpokes. Let's go. Come on. Hut! Hut! Move along. Bye, sweetie. Bye, Mom. Bye, Mom. Bye, sweetheart. Have a good day. I get front seat. Get your bag up, sweetie. I get front seat! No arguing. Slow down. Seat belts on. Hut, two, three, four. I left it by the TV. I know where it is. Okay. You stay in the car and watch your brother. Now, that is more like it. Yours? Well, it sure ain't yours. Looks like about, uh, what would you say? $50,000 there, huh? You want to tell me where you got it? It's for an investigation. Come on, Frank. I know the rules for buy money on a sting operation. You don't put it in your personal file cabinet. You stole that money. So, what are you going to do? Arrest me? Is that what you want? Is that what this is about, because I... Huh? What was that? Put that away. You know, I was wondering, Theresa. What would you do if I grabbed my gun, huh? You think you could draw on me faster than I could grab it? You want to try it? Frank, stop it. Going to make me? Don't do this, Frank. You know... maybe I'm just picking it up, you know... putting it away. Don't you trust me, Theresa? Frank! Don't do this. What are you going to do? It's your call, honey. Where's Dad? We're late! Stop it, or I'm telling. Stacey forgot her homework. They're waiting in the car. I... better get the kids to school, huh? Ah... Theresa Foley-- always one step ahead of some poor bastard hanging by the end of his leash. You think you're in control of them that you're smarter than they are. You know what? You don't control me. You do... You need help. I want you out of this house by tomorrow! You and Mommy should have a time-out. Time-out? When people fight at school Mrs. Harris makes everyone have a time-out. Yeah. Please don't go, Daddy. I got to leave, Stacey. Sometimes it's difficult for kids to understand parents and their problems. You just remember one thing: no matter what happens, I still love both of you and I always will. : You guys are the most important thing in my life. : You know that? So you're not denying that you signed these bank deposit slips? Of course it's my signature-- it's my account... and Frank's. It's your name on the slips, not his. Yeah. And in the notebook, it's in his hand, not mine. That doesn't explain the slips. Come on! Are you married, Strickner? My husband and I just celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary. Okay. Then you know, in a marriage a husband and wife take different jobs. Frank was in charge of the lawn, the cars, and the finances. He'd ask me to sign something, and I signed it. According to your husband's statement he had no prior knowledge of the deposits into your account until just yesterday. That's a lie. And he also informed I.A. that there was $10,000 missing from his buy money when he checked it back into evidence. The deposits into your account in your name, with your signature on the slips comes to $10,000. Okay, look at the notebook. Check the handwriting. Apparently, Frank's been skimming for years. And what about the $40,000 that he didn't report? I mean, you've seen his record! You all have! Look... he was my husband. He would hand me something from the bank say he was too busy to deposit it himself. I didn't know what it was and I didn't ask. And I didn't do anything wrong. I'm late picking my kids up from school. There's going to be an investigation, Agent. We'll expect your full cooperation. Understood, Theresa. Don't jeopardize your career with the Bureau. Anything I've said here I will say again under oath. The rest is up to you. I'm not imagining things. It's Frank. I know his car. It's the third time tonight, Danny. They're forcing me to testify against him. If I don't, then I'll be indicted. A charge against you would never hold up in court. That's not the point. If I'm indicted, I lose my job. Obviously I need the paycheck, but it's more than that. I like being a negotiator. I'm good at it. He's taken that away, too. Wow. Stay strong, Theresa. Hang in there. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help, okay? Not one word. Back up. Garage. Move. Stop. Turn around. My lawyer got in touch with the Attorney General's Office. They thought we could work out a deal but they won't compromise. Not with you testifying against me. I told them the truth, Frank. I have got nothing left here. I have lost my children my job, my home, and my marriage. And now they want to put me in prison? That is not going to happen. You understand me? You say one word against me in court and I will kill you. I will kill you. You believe me, Theresa? You hear what I'm saying? See you tomorrow, honey. Mrs. Foley, is this your signature on these bank deposit slips? Yes, it looks like my signature. Your Honor, may the record show that the witness is referring to her signature on Exhibits 18, 19 and 20. Now, these deposits were all cash deposits. Did you receive this cash from your husband Frank Foley? I-I don't remember. Then where did this money come from? I... maybe cashed my paycheck... or maybe I cashed Frank's paycheck... or... we could've sold something at a yard sale. A yard sale? Mrs. Foley, didn't you sit in my office and tell me that your husband gave you an envelope that was filled with...? Objection, Your Honor! Prosecutor is leading the witness. Objection sustained. Ms. Strickner, do you know where you're going with your own witness? I thought I did, Your Honor. Mrs. Foley... didn't you find this notebook in your husband's office along with $50,000 in stolen cash? I have no knowledge of that notebook. Your Honor, I request that this case be dismissed. It's clear that the State's key witness cannot confirm their accusations. Your Honor I move for a mistrial. A mistrial?! For what?! You have no witness here! Order! I have a witness... You Honor, how long does my client... Order! ...more than adequate time to prepare her witness. We're lucky that we got a mistrial. I guess your memory doesn't work when you're under oath, Mrs. Foley. Or did something else happen? Did Frank threaten you? Is that it? Neither of you gives a damn about my life or the lives of my children. I made a decision this morning. It wasn't easy. We could have put you in the witness protection program Foley. I may still have enough evidence to force a guilty plea or make him plea out. D-Did you hear what she just said? You don't even need my testimony! It was your duty to tell what happened. As far as I'm concerned you're no longer a part of this organization. I want your badge, your gun and your resignation, effective immediately. Resign, you'll get two months' pay and six months' medical insurance. Fight it, and you will get nothing. How are the kids? They both miss their father, and... ...Brian doesn't understand why he's not here. Any word? Yeah. They, uh... they cut a deal. Frank is going to prison but only for a year. It'll, uh, it'll seem like hard time, though. I mean, the, uh the cons will think he's a cop. The hacks will think he's an informant. Pretty rough fall. What are you going to do? Get a job. Raise my kids. So, I'm just going to have to get used to my new life. Is there something wrong with my application? Well, nothing at all, but you're vastly overqualified. Special agent FBI, instructor at the FBI Academy? The job here focuses on shoplifting employee theft, the occasional lost child. That's fine with me. I want a job where I can be home most nights to make dinner for my two kids. You start Monday. Great. : I get the front seat. No, I do. Mom, I get the front seat. Who got it the last time? Stacey. Get in back. You in? So, I've taken both cameras... From both these corners. From the corners. Okay. And let me show you what I've done. This camera that was over here John's hooking up here so it'll turn. I'll be home in about 45 minutes so just pop the lasagna in the oven. Okay, but we're out of milk and cereal. Not anymore.

'Cause I'm back in action, my brother. Got an AR here, Jack. Nice. AR is too big. I like that. That'll do. Got any Derringers or little .22s, or what? I got .38s, everything. Great. Beautiful. McKeller's Department Store. Sorry, Vicki. I got to leave a few hours early. That's the only time I could get a doctor's appointment. Okay. When do you think you'll be back? About 6:00. All right, I can handle it. Judy and Raymond are on the floor so watch out for the pregnant... Oh, the shoplifter, who's not really pregnant. Yeah, I know. I almost caught her last time, you know. Is Darrell with the monitors? Yeah, he should be right there. How you doing, Darrell? Helping Mrs. Funderman here find her little boy. Seems to be missing in the toy section, am I right? He's wearing a blue jacket and a green cap. I looked everywhere before I came to you. Okay, let's see if we can find a blue jacket and a green cap. Bet you he's by the video machines. I just turned away for a second. Not to worry. One thing I've learned on this job: no one ever gets lost 'cause Big Brother's always watching. There he is. Oh, my goodness. He's with his father; I'm going to kill them. Brian asked me if there really was a Santa Claus. So, what did you tell him? If you believe in him, he believes in you. Good answer. After this let's go upstairs and see Mom. Yeah, sure. Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, folks. Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas! Thank you, sir. Merry Christmas. Oh, thank you so much, folks. Merry Christmas to you, sir. Thank you. Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, sir! Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho. Say I give you money, where does it go? To the needy. And who's that-- the needy? People less fortunate than ourselves. People less fortunate than ourselves, huh? Yes! Well, you're standing out here in that ridiculous outfit begging money from a guy who just pulled a one-year stretch and lost his job and his wife and his children in the process. You're asking me for money when the only thought on my mind is... how to end my life with a touch of my dignity intact. Call that needy? Guess so, yeah. Buddy, you find somebody out here more needy than us... ... you can have my car. Got a CD player? Hey, you guys, what are you doing here? I talked to Santa, and Alicia and Stacey sniffed perfume. Where's Mom? She went out on an errand, but she'll be back by 6:00. If you want to hang out in her office, it's unlocked. So, I'd say on average we lose about two percent of gross a year to shoplifters. And that comes to about 1.8 million which is actually an acceptable loss. Everything okay in here? Yeah. When is my mom coming back? I don't know. That's a good question. Want me to try on her cell phone? Yeah. Okay. Hello. Theresa, I have a couple of bugs here who really want to say hello. Surprise! Hey, guys! How'd you know I was just thinking about you? Oh, my God! This is Walker at McKeller's! What was that? Stacey? Brian? Uh, Theresa... Theresa? Hello? Okay, uh, you guys stay here and, uh, I'm going to go check this out. Hey! Quiet! Shut up! Don't make a sound. Get up. Tell me where I find Theresa Foley? Terry? Where is she?! She's gone! She's gone; she's not here. What do you mean, she's gone? What do you mean, she's gone?! Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me. Kill you? Only two people are going to die today. Copy that, 217922, circling perimeter. Waiting for instruction, over. Police have surrounded the Green Valley Mall after a series of explosions ripped through McKeller's Department Store. According to a police spokesman armed gunmen are currently in control of the building. Do the exterior monitors now. Hurry up! Okay. I'm sorry. It'll just take a second. That's it, okay. Sit down right there. Sit down. Keep your hands where I can see them. Put them on your legs. Put them on your legs. Okay, how do I focus this thing? Just use the lever on the right. Good. Quit whining. Quit whining! Theresa Foley, head of store security. Let her through. Well, look at that. Love of my life. When they pick it up tell him we've taken several hostages and no one enters the store. Tell him! We've taken several hostages, and nobody must enter the store. Our soldiers are watching every entrance to the building. Do it! Darrell... are you okay? I was watching the monitors when the bombs went off. Ran downstairs, helped people get out of the store. Where's Vicki? She was with my kids. Theresa, no one's seen them. I think they may still be in the building. Attempting to establish eyes now. Let's hurry it up. We still haven't found the hostages. Still trying to find some eyes. Theresa. Danny, my kids are inside that building. We don't know that for sure yet. Well, I do. I just spoke to them half an hour ago. And what the hell are you guys doing taking lead on this anyway? It's been classified as a terrorist act. The store's being held by a group calling themselves the New Patriot Army. The New Patriot Army? What the hell do they want with my department store? This the only way out? Yes. Anybody in the other offices? No. They all left at 5:00. Think I'll make sure. Command, vents seem to be blocked. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Don't be afraid, you guys. It's me. It's Daddy. Daddy? What are you guys doing here? You're not supposed to be here. We came upstairs to see Mom. Okay, you listen to me. Some bad guys took over the building and I came here to protect you. Brian, Stacey you stay put, okay? If you stay in this office and don't move, you'll be safe. I'll be right back. We're in position on the loading dock. They're speaking through a hostage named Vicki Maslow. Vicki's part of my security team. She was with my kids, Danny. Can you ask if my kids are okay, please? We aren't picking up anything with the sound sensors. Now, ditto the infrared. Wall's too thick. Big goose egg on the New Patriot Army. The anti-terrorist team in D.C. thinks it might be a false organization. Stark, get the men there. Team One Command, prepare for breech. No. You're endangering the lives of the hostages! Alex, I think she's right. Let's reconsider entry and gain a little more information first. We're dealing with explosive devices and a terrorist group. One hostage has already been wounded. It's my call, not yours. I say we have to respond and respond immediately. Here, unhook yourself. Get in your office. Come on, I need help. Come over here. He's gone into shock. He's going to die if he doesn't get any help soon you know. Get over here. Did you hear me? Let's go. Get in here. Here. Tell the Feds I see their team and I want them out of the building. Do it. He wants us to pull back the SWAT team. How does he know where they are? The security cameras cover the whole store. Fine. But I'm not calling it off. Alex, I really... He knows what you're doing. We're not calling it off. Stark, give me a 10-20. Approaching the elevator, sir. He's giving us ten seconds to leave the area or he'll set off another explosion. Alex, please. Start counting. Start counting. Ten... Now she's counting. Nine. Damn it, Alex, you can't do this. Eight... Back off, Foley. ...seven... six... five... ...three... You know this is the wrong call. Command, this place is wired. Repeat, we've located a bomb. Team One, this is Command. Get out of the area! ...one. You heard him. Move it. Guess they know I'm serious now, huh? : Please don't... Shh. Shh. : Read this. Read it. Um... "We-we... "We want food and water in exchange for a hostage. "This is not a negotiable demand "and we don't want it brought by a cop. "We have a photograph here of Theresa Foley "the head of store security. It's got to be her or the hostage dies." Off line. Theresa, you yourself said it could be just one suspect. Now, they're asking for you by name. And although it's not his MO it could be Victor, it could be anybody. We don't know who this is, and I don't like it. It doesn't matter who it is. They've got my kids and I'm going to get them back. I need a radio headset and a vest. Call the Burger Palace. It's only a block from here. The standard order, and tell them to double salt those damn fries. ♪ I guess you know that you're a c-c-crazy one ♪ ♪ Your active bragging about your virtues ♪ ♪ Don't impress me none ♪ ♪ You've got no purpose... ♪ Okay, now I'm on my cell phone. We're-we're beginning the exchange. Go. ♪ Welcome, everyone, so glad to see your testimony... ♪ Alex, he's entered the security room. Gives us a window of opportunity to enter. I'm ready. Now or never. Do it. Clear! I'm on the third floor. I see one of the walkie-talkies we use for security. Okay, now, tell her to ditch her radio. Pick up the walkie-talkie. I don't want anybody else listening in. Oh, and, uh... tell her to leave the food. I understand. Where do I take the food? Um, he wants you to leave it there and to get rid of your radio. Vicki, my kids-- are they all right? Yeah, he says that they are. He? There's only one suspect isn't there? One suspect, knows my name and he won't eat the food he requested. Vicki, tell Frank Foley I want to speak with him directly. Sit down! Hi, honey. Did you miss me? So help me, Frank if you so much as breathed hard on those kids... You're in no position to be making threats. I still have a hostage; I control the situation. Then tell me what you want. Isn't it obvious yet, Theresa? I want you. You know what my objective is: the safety of Vicki Maslow and our children. Good answer. Come out here. Come out here! Go, go, go. Okay. Now, you walk to your office and we'll make the exchange. Delta Team is closing in and I have a sniper in the air as we speak. Mommy! Hey, baby, stay right there. See? I wasn't lying. Mommy's here. And she's going to stay with me and help fight the bad guys. Stop. Now, what I need you two to do is go outside with Alicia and wait for us, okay? Can you do that for me? That's all right, kids. You, too, Alicia. Go on, sweetheart. Go on. It's all right. We'll be right out. Everything's going to be fine. Hi. Drop your weapon! Get down, now! Use both hands. You can't get away! It's over! Who says I'm trying to get away? Command, I just picked them up on the third floor, north side. Is that what this is all about? Going out with a bang? What about Stacey and Brian? Who's going to take care of them if we're both dead?! Mention consequences to the hostage-taker. That's chapter six in the manual? If you give yourself up I will help you get a good doctor and an attorney. State alternatives; offer to help the hostage-taker. That's-that's chapter eight. This is not a game. I don't trust anything you say Theresa. You understand that?! As far as I'm concerned, this entire marriage was a sham! I loved you! Don't you finally get that?! I still lie in bed every night and think about you! About our wedding! And our first Christmas together! And when Stacey was born! God... she was beautiful. So beautiful. I know... I know what you're going through. No, you think I don't, but I do. Wishing like hell that this all never happened and wanting to get out of it with just a shred of dignity intact. That's all. They are in the conference room. Command, I have a shot. I'm taking it. No, don't shoot! Theresa's in there. Get them out of there, all of them. Abort. Repeat: Abort. No, don't shoot! Don't shoot! No matter what happened between us there's something inside of you that hasn't changed. I can see it. It's who you really are. It's the man I married. Do what you got to do. Just remember that when you make your decision, Frank. Stay back! Back it up! Back it up! Okay, they're coming out. I'm going out there. Don't move! Put your hands back on your head! Frank! Drop the gun! Drop it! Frank! I love you, Theresa. Frank, no! They awarded me this for what happened at the department store. It should be yours. I don't want an award, Alex. I never did. What about your old job? You think maybe you want that? So what did he say? He offered me my old job back. Ah. Thank you... and thank you... and you. You ready to go? So you still looking for a partner? Yeah, you know it. Got anybody in mind?
