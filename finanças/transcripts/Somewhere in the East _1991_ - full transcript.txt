SOMEWHERE IN THE EAST AFTER THE NOVEL "THE FACES OF SILENCE" by AUGUSTIN BUZURA The situation in Bociu is a lot more difficult than in the other villages. Other activists tried and failed. That's exactly why we thought of you, comrade Radu. In these historic days, we all need good honest people attached to the cause. Comrade secretary.. I've been working ever since I remember in town, in the factory. I don't really know how to cope with the agriculture. I'm only shopping from the market, that's all. There is here in the area, a band of legionaries which terrorizes the people and frightens the ones who want to enter the collectivization. This is Sterian, their boss, ex officer and great admirer of Antonescu. Plus the farmers which he conned and which are not to be neglected. They've been on the front and they handle very well the weapons. You will not be alone, you realise that, don't you? But here is what you mustn't forget, it will a be tough fight. On the other hand, there is a kulak (rich peasant), Magureanu, who is related to everyone. In the time of famine he supplied the people with grain and that's how he bought them all. If you convince him, practically you finished your mission. With the others, it's a matter of days. Sir, comrade Colonel! Are you alone? But Clopotel and Podut where are they? I thought you had a mission, right? There are on it now. Welcome, indeed. Everything's ready! Come on, get up! I caught a kulak butchering a calf clandestinely and I sequestered him. The fucking thieves! They don't pay the quotas on time but they know how to speculate. The fucking roads! Lupse will be with you all the time. Understood. It's true he's quite soft, a little uneducated, but he is from this village. Until they are going to send specializes staff, that's it. Here, please! Good day, Mr Magureanu! Good day. I am happy you honored my house. Shut up! Good day. Come in! Well, everyone who passed through here, all your comrades insisted to honor me. Some had in mind to convince me.. ...others were just hungry, but most of them just came for the quota. Have a sit! But yourself, for which of these all reasons did you come? For all of them! But which one of them pushed you harder? Well, Mr Magureanu, we ate, the quota's all paid for.. ...there is only one more left. Well, with the papers there's no trouble, that's where we'll all end up. I realize that, but the law won't let me. Precisely the law? Well, you forgot that I am wealthy, a "kulak" as they say today.. I take God as my witness, I never took anybody's land. I bought it fair and honestly, after my father lost it. I never drank, never wasted money, I saved, and saved and saved.. for these sons of mine! But being wealthy there is no place for me there, I'm not allowed. That's what the paper is saying,that we sabotage, we stay in the way of collective work. If that's the law, I respect it, for it says well! One thing I don't understand. How you explain the fact that me, who have been working all my life like a dog be equal with the one who never did anything? Mr Magurean, of fools and of lazy bastards I was sick all my life. Times changed, it cannot be like before. We'll transform the agriculture, we'll modernize it. We'll bring tractors, we'll bring chemical fertilizers There are only hills here, it doesn't work. We'll make it work, we'll make it! If it must, I'll go with the times. So, why have you been waiting for me to come and sort out your problem? You knew very well that this Magureanu is not allowed to enter in the collective organisation! He has fooled you, comrade Radu! What? He wants us to make him poor so we reduce him the quota. As for the papers he'll find reasons to delay it. I told him: bring the bloody application, so we have it on file, and then we'll make you a proletarian. You think he wanted to? The bloody thief! Who's there? "You have 48 hours to leave the village", Sterian's style. Who's his informer?I think Magureanu You think or you're sure? Sure! Nobody saw them together, but Magureanu is the most important man around Nothing moves without him knowing, Comrade Clopotel, the president of the Council and comrade Podut, party secretary. Muresan! Not in! He's in, the fucking thief! Listen! If you're not at the Council in an hour, we'll come and get you! And you 'll have problems! All the peasants get the lands, the ploughs, the oxen, the carriages and they work with them together, in common All of them will belong to the collective farm and yourselves will work within it. Are you signing in? Yes! Good. What's your name? Ioan. Ioan.Sign here! Oh, no, not now.Then when? I'll see, I'll think about it. This land is still yours. Nobody can take it from here. We will not move it from here. You will work organized in working brigades. Yes, so this would be like this: You cut off, nice and easy how should I put it..." the organ", and you put it in my hand saying "Take it, it's still yours"! BUCAREST "Gh Gheorghiu Dej is speaking, The general secretary of the Romanian Workers Party ...The tractor, the machines they are bringing wealth! Well, you see, this is the modern agriculture! You used to live in poverty with the nose stuck in the bottom of the cows. You have to think of your children, of their future! What is it, comrades? What happened? ..They took him last night... You can see that you're not from arround here. You behave as if you are a foreigner. We, the romanians, mustn't turn against each other, that's what they are waiting for. I'm a good romanian, you know. I don't want this. In the war I suffered a lot from the foreigners. Don't think I didn't suffer! I was a servant, then I worked at a patron, I hardly managed to get a qualification. But you are wrong if you think I want the worst for you. It's for your good I'm here far from my family. You think I have no soul, no pain, no needs. Let us live the way we learned from our forefathers Without us the country dies. You think you can force good on people? Yes, I do! When a man understands the good you made, he will be grateful later. You know where you are wrong, you and Lupse? You think we are more stupid than we are and you think you must guide us. I explain it to you, not guiding you! The road is new and it's not the case for you to have the impression you are on it, without knowing the direction! It goes to socialism whether you like it or not. I should have known you will follow Lupse who used to herd my cows at the end of the village. Lupse has changed since then, and you better be more careful. You could be arrested for agitating against our order. Hey, stay there! All right, come on!In the wagon.Shut up! Come on, move! And you, what are you doing here? Move, come on, move! What, comrade Brainea! You started to arrest the people? Why wasn't I told? Comrade Radu! Don't you think you overcome your attributions? If I remember well, you were send here to HELP with the collectivization process. and it seems that you 're kind of dragging. I know them.They aren't the most dangerous people. If you would have asked, I could have told you. We have our sources. But what's bothering me is that instead of reporting, you are protesting! Do you know that three of the peasants run to Sterian? Do you know they are hiding weapons? Listen to me carefully! Who doesn't understand the history is changing will pay dearly, is it clear? Who's not with us, is against us! I heard you paid a visit to Magureanu, and you drank together. And what did you want me to do, to kill him? Chain him and force him to sign on? No, but it wouldn't hurt you to be firmer and more vigilant! If I talk nicely they are not pleased. If I get rough with them, they'll run of to Sterian. Then what the hell am I supposed to do? Stop complaining and act! To hell with it, comrades! We only see each other in assembly and that's all You're not helping me, you don't do anything! You, comrade Podut, you are complaining to everyone that you're only a clerk, that you don't want anything You, comrade Lupse you're hunting in the forest and pretend shooting in the people's enemies! Don't tell me how many wild boars and how many enemies you have! You're working in your style, comrade Radu. I live here, I know how much is worth each of them. They are cunning!They never say yes or no, but they put off you for years. Slap one of them and you'll see how quick he comes to his senses You know that saying: "We'll teach who dooesn't know, we'll help who can't do it, we'll force who doesn't want to". All right.What would you do in my place? I'd send a subpoena with a fine to each of them. You must come at 12 and 11 minutes. If you're not here on time, you pay. And then a raid in the village! The fence is not painted!pow! The finance! The side trench is not cleared, pow! The fine... You'll see how easy will react their conscience. How come "I can't"? Hey, you better stop staring, come and help us! But where we will keep the oxen? At the collective farm! And who's going to take care of them? Mihut! He doesn't know them! He doesn't know their temper! Well, uncle Pavel, nobody can reach an understanding with you. If the man doesn't work for himself.. Hei, Sterian, come to your senses, you have no chance! Forget about the collectivization, Radu, or I'll endow you with two cubic meters of dirt! If you give yourself up, we'll be easy on you! Hear this: I'll give you two days to think about it. It's your only chance to stay alive! If I'm to chose, then I better chose death... It's more pleasant. I can take it better than the communism! What about the Anglo-Americans, you don't say a word about them, do you? Look who's talking! You, who together with your bunch of slobs have sold the country to the russians! I'll give you 24 hours! You know everything that happens in this village. You either help us and help also the peasants by showing them the right way or, if not, we'll arrest you for instigation against our order, is it clear? You know, the prisons are full of priests. Now that you understood, are you coming in? Why did he take my clothes out of the yard? You answer my question! Why should I paint white the poles of my fence, it's not a hospital! You're fining me again? Why didn't you come at 8:16 sharp? I've been mowing the grass! Am I supposed to teach you the order? You think the socialism is build up in chaos? Give up the weapons! We have none! In 24 hours you should have them! We can't get them! What the hell are you waiting for? How patient can one be? I can't wait for that holiday! It's your move the whole village is waiting for, you know! So...send for your descendants, if not I'll get them here by force! Talk nicely..or else..I'll take you to where you came from! What are you doing? Are you beating him? This land is worked by my people and you are staying in the house I build! You, kulak! Listen, don't make me angry! For if I start then I hardly can.. My sons! Hey, you've grown! Well, my dears, I called you to decide what are we going to do with the land. I'd only have kept for myself a few acres so I could work them on my own. The rest is yours.I've divided it long ago. LONG LIVE THE GREAT SOVIET PEOPLE, CONSTRUCTOR OF THE COMMUNISM I'll stay as long as..there is no law to force me. You're not thinking straight, Iuliu. I'm afraid they'l kick you out of the school. Me? But what influence can it have? Wait a minute: I'm a student in law, what the hell? They need evidences, witnesses.. You seem as you are living in the stars. Why should we ruin ourselves because of a fool? Father, sell everything and come with us in town. You can live confortable with us. I don't want to hear this ever, Ilie! You do what you want.. I don't want to lose my seminars because of some arse hole. I am here to sign, tomorrow I'll go back. Father, really, don't misjudge me but the professors at the Medicine University don't have a good sense of humor. If I don't get good marks.. Who is that woman? All kind of people turned up. This one says she is looking for deposits, but I believe she is looking for something else. That idiot forgot to greet us. SHAME TO THE KULAK MAGUREANU WHO IS SABOTAGING THE PEOPLE'S INTEREST That's the moron, it's because of him that you can't sleep? What did you say? The capes, the swords and to attack.. Shut up, hell up What does this son of yours want, Magureanu? Father, tell him we'll visit him.We'll sign right today. We'll come to you, I want only to let my horse at home. If you leave, we will find you. DEATH TO KULAKS! My lords,...the honored jury, we'll assist to my father's decease as an exploiter... Our father who art in Heaven Hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven Give us this day our daily breadand forgive us our.. Amen! Look at them! We disturbed them from the snack! The best chicken meat is the pork! They can take a break. They sucked enough of the people's blood. We came, so you didn't have to disturb yourselves! Look for the weapons. Don't oppose. You wanted to see me, don't you? We are here, gentlemen.We save you a trip. Look the beautiful boys in here. I'm a law student and I know the laws! You have no permission to enter the house. See, comrades, he is threating me! These two, educated in our schools What are they teaching you in there? Throwing stones at the people's slogans? Or maybe you don't like the friendship with the great power, The Soviet union? My father didn't have the money to send me to school I worked in a factory since I was 14! Iuliu! Magureanu! I'll kill you, I'll kill you! Stop it!Stop it! Leave him! No, Iuliu! The prison will eat you alive! You are attacking the public power? Stop it.Magureanu, stay out of this! Leave him alone! Stay out of this.. Hit him! It will serve you right! Get him! Go! The fruits of your kulak education! I told you he's coming, too. Now that we have them all, we can do the papers, mr Magureanu. Have I ever said no? But you didn't say yes, either. I didn't say! However there is no law that could force me to! I've waited! I called for my sons. Now I'm signing! We might just not want you anymore. You proved yourself an incoherent and hostile element. If I am like you said I am, why did you kept looking for me day and night Why did you make me wait in front of the village Hall, and made me bring me food from home? Why have you filled my life with fines? Why are you keeping us in here without a reason? You know better, we have good reasons! Take that paper and write down what you must! Here, I even give you my pen. I say, after all this is done, you will leave us alone, that's my condition. If I were you, I wouldn't put any conditions! I do! Down! Also write down: "Long live the Romanian People's Republic", or are you objecting? and "Long live the fight for peace", if the Anglo Americans don't mind! Well, that's it! I had enough! Sons, we're going home! You're the only one going. We're not finished with them. If something happens to them, I'll find you even in the next world. Don't forget this! Sterian.What are we doing? Out, hands up! Out, come on! What are we doing? If anybody pulls the trigger you'll be blown up! Don't make any foolish thing! Which one is playing there? If you don't want to rot in a salt mine leave now! It's my last warning What's wrong with you, you stupid cowards, back to the car, come on! Radu, I only hope you are smart enough to drop on your belly. Or your woman will remain a widow! Stejar! Take their weapons! Gorun! Check the car throughly! You will pay for this and not only you, but also the ones that informed you! You brought this on yourself, Radu! I warned you I'd been watching. Who is in there?Out with your hands up! Please don't shoot! I'm a medicine student and he is my brother! He is crazy, they made him crazy. Ah, wait a minute, Radu. You may shoot as much as you like, but first I have some bussiness with the gentleman! No, Iuliu.Leave him! Get up, Radu, let's have a man-to - man talk! Iuliu! Let me see now what you're made of! Leave me alone, leave me alone! Fool! Your underpants are wet! Coward, you bastard! Get up! So, you three aren't police, are you? They would take you to jail? How can you do that, Radu? Who are you? I don't hear you! Iuliu Magureanu. And they are my brothers, Ilie and Carol. Undo their cuffs! So, Magureanu, complain now. Tell them I tricked you! Ask them to let you kill me! How did you dare to laugh at these children? What have they done to you? Haven't they read Marx? I'm warning you...not to interfere and let us go If I get out alive you'll pay dearly! If we all got to this point Ill show you an unique show. Undress yourselves! Quick, come on! Gorun, at the slightest resistance you shoot them! He doesn't care, Radu! He knows if you ever catch him, it's in the gallows for him Stejar! Search for their Party cards! Make them eat them! Sorry, Radu, we have no water, it will be hard to swallow. That's how we swallowed your communism. The ones that refuses will be decorated with a bullet in the arse! You will end up very bad, you legionaries! It won't take long until then! We never were and never will be legionaries. I'm an elite officer, Radu! Is it because of me or because of you that these people left homes? The Occident and the lost wealth blinded you! You mean, you are taking my house, my forest, my sawmills you are shoving down my throat your primitive doctrine and I am just to sit? You are waiting for the Americans? They don't give a shit on you, you're stuck here with us, you fools! They don't even know where Romania is! Eat it! What, don't you like it? That's it, Radu, you can't say I made the choice! You want to die. My word is a promise. You have no honor! All right, I'll do this, too, I want to see, I want to see I wouldn't have done it even forced, but I want to show those intellectuals over there and those cowards from there that you have no honor. I eat it. Look, I eat it just to show them you have no word! Well, I'm eating it. Look, I am eating it, it's all right? I see that you have appetite, Radu Come on, Lupse, come on, Lupse, come on! This is really the last warning, Radu! Come on, come on! "Romanian people had to endure many catastrophes over his entire history but none as disastruos as the the comunism." The comunist power reaching the helm of the country started a massive hunt Tens os thousands arrests, mock trials...deportations" The red terror has installed itself in Romania. Romanians!The fate of the country depends on our resistance! The allied forces won't delay more! "The United states are preparing the liberation of the captive people from the Soviet tyranny" It is very important that the heroic resistance in the mountains be supported by every romanian. Keep alive the torch of freedom and independence I dressed you! Hey, boys, you are on the territory of the partisan unit"Avram Iancu" and me, the commanding officer, captain Sterian welcomes you. We are fighting for the liberation of the country from the communist terror. We are not alone.The west is watching us. Their effective help won't be late. We have concrete promises. What's going to happen to us? Well, you would have end up in jail and probably you would have been out ruined. So you have no other chance.You will have to fight next to us. Avram Iancu was only 23 when he leaded the revolution, and his descendants are building the socialism I could die of shame! Captain, I respect your act of courage. But I am a weak man! I've lived all my life surrounded by books.I don't know.. One can learn anything, mr Magureanu. Look, this woman.. She was raped by one of Brainea'man during a party and Stanca, from a weak and delicate girl, became a perfect handler of fighting techiques capable of any sacrifice. Captain, I'd like to go back to University. At this time I feel they are looking for us even in our colleagues' luggages. If there I can't find any support, I'll come back. I need three days for this. If they catch you, you will bring them here, won't you? I'll tell them I left you immediately and I stayes hidden in the forrest. I'll go tell father, too. He must know what happened to us or he'll just go crazy. The trip is pointless, but I don't want you to have any remorse. I'm staying. You, Iuliu, proved yourself wiser, so tomorrow you'll start the training. I'll give you the necessary instructions, toniight, before leaving. Until then we could rest a while. And think about a subject: we are at war and treason means death. Hey, comrade, will you stop for a while! Hang on, boy, nobody is threating you! Listen you idiot, get somebody from the council to come here! He's gone, that bastard! Sir! How many were they? Sterian and two men.Three. Three. Cowards, bastards, shitbags, that's what you all are! How is it possible that all of you be scared by three bandits? What kind of people are you, letting yourselves be undressed? Walk, walk naked comrades, if that's how you liked it. Come on! Who's there? Crina, the cashier from the tavern. Comrade Lupse send me to clean up the place. You, whore! See what I have in here. Come on! Father! Carol, you are going nowhere! There is no place for you to go! I'm not giving you to them. You are weak and helpless my dear son. You could not take it. In here I'll build a wall. Noone will notice. This is ridiculous, father. How am I to live in there?And for how long? Well, this cannot go forever. But I didn't do anything! I'm not guilty of anything! This was left from the first priest of our family. You see, they say it was our family, Magureanu which founded this village... At the time of the tartar invasions, a Magureanu took refuge in with his sheeps he has cut the forest around and built a church out of twigs which he carried with him in all his trips. That' so you know that no matter how hard you will suffer, he suffered more. All my life I worked like an animal.. Like an ox...I worked all the time And now I am left alone to start all over again. But where to start from? God, kill me, don't let me see how my lineage is being destroyed! Everything 's gone to hell.We are all wanted by the Securitate Did you speak to the dean? I told him everything in detail I explained it must be a misunderstanding I asked him to defend me, not as a thief but as an eminent scholar I was his favorite student. He complained that this is something above his power that he himself feels that he won't be there for long. Do you know what he told me? To give ourselves up at once! What a stinking world! I'm sick of it! You should go my dear to Iuliu and tell him that I ask him to leave those silly things. And to come back at once. As soon as he is here, we'll go all of us at Bucharest. By train, by car and if this isn't possible, we'll go by foot. to complain to the party, to the government! That bloody land! If it wasn't for it, if you would have renounced it! Not the land, Ilie, the land is sacred, that's what maintain us! I'm sorry, father.You didn't understand much of what's going on around you. We are the class that has to dissapear. Well, you are the clever one, but I know there are people, not classes But they have to be patient, I cannot take it, father. I can not! I'm tired! I am dead! And look what is happening to me! This shit has to happen to me! What kind of people are you? You bumped your head on the first obstacle and you are crying already! But life must be lived the way it was given to us, good or bad.. We have no right to complain! Sterian promised he'll help to cross the border with the plaane which brings us provisions. There we could continue the school, we'll be free. How could you be free in a foreign country? The country is here, the place you were born, good or bad, it's ours! Father, spare me the speech. I know it very well Here are our tombs, our hopes, here one must expiate his sins. I know, I know! You'll tell me that this people has been through a lot, that it resisted in time, I know! I'm not revolting against the people nor against you or the regime! I am grieving for my fail. The people is eternal, the country is eternal but I have few decades to live, that's the tragedy! What am I supposed to do until this craziness will pass? I would like to remind you that I lost everything: wealth, school, home and I was the one to built them back, so they'll know that I passed through this life. You think I don't suffer when I'm looking at you? Ilie, for better and for worse we have to be together. Please, please, I need another term! That's just to teach you to pay the quota on time! I told you once, twice, three times! Enough!You are cunning!Enough! Comrade Radu!You aren't correct! What's the matter, teacher? It's not humanly! The socialism must be build for the people, not against them! As soon as you spend a year or two in school, you're going crazy. DIRTY COMUNIST SERVANT Cowards! What was that, comrade Radu? Shall I tell Brainea? Look, they wrote about you in the paper. Come on! It passed, isn't it? Next week your wife and daughters will come to see you, so.. It's for them I'm wasting my life, those fucking whores! Speak! Who beat Radu? I don't know. When did you last see Sterian? I didn't see him. But who brings him food? Magureanu, Magureanu.. Why don't you want to help us? You could do us a lot of favors! I signed on!What more do you want? Don't play the fool with me! Listen!Give us Sterian and we will take into account of it. No one will know you told us! I don't know this man Someone warned Sterian. I don't know him! I'm not the man you look for. You are paid for that. If my corn crop is compromised, I just eat less I don't call you for help. Teacher, during the perquisition we found reactionary books condemned by the history. Octavian Goga. Poems. Water. My God! Damn you! You killed my man! God, Ion, don't let me! Shut up, woman, he won't die that easy. Put it here. Jump forward! Down! Jump forward! Down! Jump forward! Down! Up! Down! Up! Down! Up! Down! Enemy behind! Enemy on the right! Right! Enemy in front! Enemy on the right! Up! Enemy on the left! Enemy on the eft!Enemy on the right! Enough! At ease! If you want to live, you must be better than your enemy! Only then you become really a man! Don't you realize that everything is useless? It's futile! I should kill you for these words! You know, we have another option. The second time I won't accept you anymore! Carol! Why did you bring me so much food? Yesterday they told me that in 24 hours to bring my sons to them, no matter how. They might keep me for a while. Father, you know what I thought? To get out of here and go somewhere in the city. I could rent a room. Encourage your mother as much as you can. She is a woman and she is weak. Only one more man knows about you. Father Mitrea. He will bring you food and books. He's a hell of a man, father Mitrea! He even has a good relationship with Radu. But mostly with the notary with whom is involved with. I can't stay in here anymore! I feel I am suffocating! I can't anymore! We'll get out of this, too if the good Lord wants it! Woman, is your husband ready? God's curse will be on you, Lupse! You're taking him for nothing. You know very well what he did. I had enough of your lies! Come on, search everywhere! Come on, woman..Enough! Leave alone my pig, people! Leave the pig alone, we'll starve! Don't worry, Gherman, we'll pay for it in the next regime. Why didn't you tell me that you see Sterian, you bandit? Why? You give him food! Son of a bitch! You know how to read? I was placed here. I won't kick you out, but you know, here is neither a conference room, nor a brothel! Carol, help me! Write down by tomorrow these conferences, because I can't cope anymore with so many duties! "The failure of the war provoking politics" and "The exacerbating of the class fight in the actual stage" The first is for Radu the second for Podut. Should I..? You're a philosophy student..Damn it.. God forgive me! You don't have to write complicated things, write down anything that you want.. Radu will have an inspection and he wants to have good results. How did these get to you? Radu gives them to Podut, Podut passes them o the notary which... ...gives them to me.. I had more delicate ones.. about the eradication of mysticism and superstitions, atheistic and Marxist stuff.. I know that even if I pray a hundred years, the good Lord won't forgive me. Who has moved in our house? An activist, a woman called Bindea. They had her inspect and say if anything shows up. Now she's gone to town Calm the dog, down, aunty Maria. Sst! She's coming! I looked for some drugs for the poor woman Are you related? Yes, but that's not why I'm helping her, but his health.. She is complete afflicted. As a mother you could imagine how you should feel the mothers have their own ideology. An then, that's my job, to help, to encourage... Until they'll find modern solutions we 'll have to listen to their wishes, their sins.. Unfortunately, I am a sinful person The moment I see a beautiful woman, I forget that I'm a priest.. But how can you even think of such a thing, father? I am a serious married woman. I came here with a special assignement. Well, you see, I know that very well! Exactly that's why I repent, Confessing a part of the truth, I want to free myself, to humiliate myself to ask for forgivness, for the love I secretly feel for you ever since you came here. I understand you, father, and maybe if I wasn't married, I mean, if I didn't have a husband which in fact he is not a real husband to me, I would have been mad. I'll never be able to look you in the eyes, comrade Bindea! I know you're honest, calm, firm, on the other hand I make mistakes! I have to ask you one more favor. Come on, slap me! Slap me as long as you like! I'll stand them, I deserve them, look, here's the bare cheek. God!What are we doing, father! Have we lost our mind? I don't care! You will be punished the way I know! Satana! Leave me alone! Why aren't you patient? father.. You have no shame..you devil! They must beneficiate, too, from the results of their work! Life isn't made only for work... Comrade Coza, it's a pleasure to see you happy! You know how to make at once a good relationship with the people! Help yourself with anoher one! I can never refuse the pastry wih milk and floor! It's the twelfth! I can eat no more! Cheers! You have no idea, Radu how much I know about you! Really? You never told us about that strike of '41 when you gave the boss a polenta and he threw up his guts. So, you don't know all about it... No! I run in the locker room, I replaced the ham from the polenta and replaced it with grease I came back in the room, waited my turn to speak and said: Mister Vinter, taste yourself, so you 'll see how the working class is living! Well done! That damned sniveling one! When he started to throw up everybody laughed at him. The stupid ones, they couldn't understand why he wasn't able to eat a piece of polenta! Listen!Come here! It's obvious once you were more determined, more energetic You don't fight with the same passion against the enemy, anymore you are less.. I 'll do my own self criticism, comrade Coza. I was probably wrong. Of course, I was wrong! You see, comrade Brainea mocks me and lowers my authority. It's not good!The activist's word is the law!It's the party's law! Here! Who the hell invented these women? They only bring bad luck! Leave her, leave her, look at her, she sleeps so deeply! Oh, you.. Radu and a few officers are moving in here. The soldiers will sleep at the council. Be strong! It can't be too long! Do whatever you like but he mustn't hear you, if not it will be bad! And look over those speeches, he said they aren't mobilizing enough. What the hell more should I write? Write about the rebuilding of the country, about the "five years plan", about the tractors Swear the social class as hard as you can.. And invent something about the good life that it will be in comunism, they won't know who wrote it. Well, Maria, still complaining about not having a man? I brought you plenty of them, one better than the other! I have my husband, who you crippled and also have my sons which you arrested, being innocent. Innocent? If they were innocent why did they run away? What kind of sons did you raise? In your life, have you ever done something good for someone? I'll do, when I'll trow them here in your couryard, tied up together with Sterian! Thieves!Bastards!My house is full of thieves and you let them rob me! What, kulak woman, the romanian soldier is not allowed to eat? God will punish ou! Lupse, go get the priest to get her an injection, if not I'll calm her... You, cursed ones! Come one, Maria, let them be.. You won't die because of a chicken, your yard is full of them! Ilie!Carol! Louder! Louder! (What I am doing)I'm calling my sons to death! You'll call them until tomorrow, they'll hear you ar some point! Good lord! Come on, woman!Come on! Anything would be better for them, rather than be caught by you! Iuliu! Ilie! Come on, go to confession! I've struggled to raise them and also I have to call them to their death! Calm down a little! Oh, no!I'll scream until I won't have a voice! If my boys will see what they are doing to me, they'll turn themselves in and they'll be finished! How much is the cow, father? Tell mother we'll be home by Christmas. How is she? Fine.And our father? He is alive! Give us some money! We want to go to Bucharest, we are no longer with Sterian. Take it quickly! Mother is at the market? Nearby, at the pig's market. Be careful, she is really weakened. We just want to see her.Let's go! Comrade Radu.. Aaa, the priest is here! Ah, father, are we sinning badly if we are drinking? Each one should do as his concience dictates Listen, priest, I'd like to cut a part of your beard.. Yes, but I'm afraid the notary will ruffle your hair. Father, come and drink to be at the same level as us because the drink is not for pigs, but between intellectual people... I'm glad to see so many intellectuals gathered in one place For years I've been the only intellectual in the village. Well...looking at you, I can hardly desert you. Let the priest sing! Let the priest sing! All right!A glass and a song so you can see, I haven't always live, to my shame all my life in fasting anf prayers I'm asking the party members not to leave the room "The gipsy woman.." No! I have a tent which is sewed with a "sula"(bodkin), (pula=dick) and a gipsy woman, I wish I kiss her lips.. I wish I "eat" her mouth.. Kiss her lips! My gypsy woman, and mine, and ypours, and everybody's And whoever wants her..and mine, and yours..and whoever wants her.. Take your coats off!Eat something and wash yourselves.. Mother, how can you think of that? They could come every minute! Give us some smoked meat and some money. I have everything ready. In the bag upstairs. And you, what are you going to do? Nothing. I watch helplessly all this mess! You? We stay here we can. Sterian lied to us. Now both Radu and Sterian are looking for us. Why? Come on, tell him, he knows her. He stole Stanca from him. It's an excuse! For revenge! I can't stand anybody's orders no more! What do you have in mind? Out life is pretty much over. Give yourselves up! At least you'll stay alive, not even them are eternal! Better dead than in a salt mine. Don't be sad, mother! I saw in the forest the way they dragged you and made you cry I was shaking, otherwise I would have shot them. No, Iuliu!We are not murderers! How many times we could fill them with bullets but our conscience didn't allow us Stay here with me. It's no life, but at least it is neither death. It's better in prison than here. At least it's more space. God, rest your servants, Vasile and Ioan From dust you were born, to dust you shall return. Poor souls. You mustn't mourn them, father. If others were doing their duty like them, the history would have been different. I only hope that at least up, in Heaven, God will not turn His face from them. Somebody must die so others can win. You mustn't lie yourself, mr Sterian. The area is sorrounded, new troops are coming every day. Run somewhere!Too much blood had been spilled! God will help us find another way to get rid of them! My way has no return. If it comes to it, pray for me.I did the right thing! "Don't let yourselves be intimidated by the comunists! Down with the bolshevick's sole!" Fuck his mother.. Get behind!They stole the airplane which brought blood for the hospital. Let's go. The bloody thieves! They leaved it! Look at them, as some tramps. The more in the salt mines, the less on the fields. Keep doing it like this and soon we'll have to work the land ourselves! I'm quite surprised to hear such things from you. Why are we building machines? Why are we building factories? Sterian's only choice is the direct confrontation. Yes, sir, yes, the mountain is surrounded The water source are being watched, the roads are checked The militia men and the soldiers are patrolling everywhere. Yes, yes, everything is in order. You live far from your family. It's hard, I know it, in fact my husband lives in the city but I haven't seen him for a year. As a matter of fact.. "We crossed the forest together and you never touched me.." What? If I knew, you wouldn't have been sorry, would you? Sir! Last night they tried to get out for water. After some firing they went back. One is alive. How many dead? Three soldiers and two of them. I know the big one. Listen, do you want to go to the hospital and stay alive or not? Just a cup of water.You'll get later. Where is Sterian? Sterian and two men got away last nisght durinf the firing How many are you?Where are the others? Each of us spent the winter where we could. Very few returned in the spring. How many are you? Do you still know me, uncle Pavel? Well? No, mr Sterian. Give me some food and something to drink, if you have any. Right away, mr Sterian. No news from the Anglo Americans? No, uncle Pavel, they didn't come and maybe they never wanted to come. What are they saying about me in the village? That some wolf has eaten you or that you are dead.. Did you like the way we fought? They have outnumbered us, if not.. Anyway we did out duty.We raised the warning. To be honest with you, I didn't have the time to think about this, they did a lot of searching, so today, if you don't mind, the living and the dead are hating you as much.. If I was a winner, my arse woudn't have been big enough for the guys like you to kiss it. They only hate me, don't they? The communists just as well. I was a good romanian.Don't forget that. This people needs examples. What a pity, you never understood. But you'll remember me and you'll regret me. It won't be long, when you'll be tired of the comrades. Maybe we alredy are. Aren't we romanians? What are we? Who work the land? So many years of terror and so many dead Bring some red wine.I'll go in the stable and sleep a while. Come on, Lupse.After you, comrade colonel. You bastard! Come on! Sterian, give yourself up! Sterian! If you don't come out, we'll set the barn on fire! Come on! I'll give you one more chance! Sterian!It's for the las time! He must be here.The man's wife didn't see him coming out. What's the matter?Where is my baby goat? What? Get away from there..somebody could shoot you! Let the kid come in..Hey, kid I saw your baby goat going in, come on..Go! Come on, kid. Go in! Go! There is a man with blood, he is sleeping. Bloody bastard! You didn't have the guts to confront me until the end! You ran, pig, you gave up, you left the battle, you were afraid Why didn't you have the courage to fight me to the end? You wanted to cheat, didn't you? Come on, decorate me with a bullet in the arse, come on! "This is how all the enemies of the people will pay" What's your name?Vasile of Barbu. Where is your ID? I didn't take it with me. What shall I do now?Take you to the station? Forgive me! We told you so many times to have your ID with you. Where shall I keep it in these clothes? Hey, you over there.I'm talking to you! Your papers! Don't move. Lower your weapon. The gun, too, Fast! Get back! There he is! Come on, you have a boy.And Stanca? She is fine! That's the end of it. In fact all things must come to an end. You'll never know.. After that story I wanted to kill myself, but it wasn't meant to be! Now with the baby..we must take care of this life. Which life? The life we have and what's left of it. Iuliu! Take the child and leave to the sheepfold. I demand you! Iuliu! I demand you to save the child! Ilie, go with them. You could help them. I stay here. How do you feel? What does it matter anymore? Give yourselves up at once! Throw your weapons and come out with your hands up! Stanca! Stanca, hurry up, there is no time to waste That's Iuliu. My daughter, think of the child, it's crazy what you want to do! I can't, dad I'm going back. Without him.. Give yourselves up and nothing will happen to you! There is no point in resisting!You were betrayed! Sterian was caught! We know Sterian betrayed us! You could hire him. If you don't come up until I'll count to ten, I'll set the mill on fire! Before you count I'll show you I'm not kidding. Walk out with the child, don't kill him. The mill is surrounded. Look, I am hurt!.. Here, as well.. Touch it so you can see. Are you afraid? Give yourselves up! What guarantees are you offering us, Radu? My word! Anything else, we are clear about your word! I'll start counting: One, two, three.. You want some sunflower? Leave me alone! We are not doing anything, anyway ...Six! Radu, stop the counting and listen: I could have killed you long ago with a grenade, but I didn't want that! Comrade colonel, the attack started! What attack? Look there..lower. We want to show you we didn't kill anybody and we save ourselves running The bastards! We didn't do anything, you arrested us for nothing! We'll be on our concience, Radu! You distroyes us, Radu! If you're killing us anyway, at least tell us where is my father? Is he alive? Give yourselves up and you will meet! You can't escape You are not in the position to negociate! Where is my father? Where he belongs! And where is that? Where he is! Then how do you want me to believe you? Don't believe if you are in the mood for dying! Fire, don't stop, fire! Hands up! I'm giving up! Don't shoot! Father! Why did you shoot, Radu? He gave themselves up! Hands up! Hands up, don't you hear? Get out of there! Why did you come back, Stanca?! You shouldn't have! Throw the gun away!Hands up! Get her alive! Iuliu, Iuliu, shoot!Kill me! Shoot!

As a soul sheperd I mustn't push you into sin but as a man that cares about your health, my son... Don't touch me! Open up!Open up! But I assure I won't touch you! Don't be scared! I didn't warn you how to behave with such women Either you let them cry and talk and you go about your bussiness or, and that's the best way, you roughen her a little A woman likes to make mistakes but first ou must give her an excuse. Next time slap her around and she'll become a little lamb. Why are you coming back after you got scared? Well, if I must, what can I do? I didn't want then, now I do.
