Bubble baths are the best. They make me feel so good. Hey, Uncle Uzuki's calling. Hello? Uncle? Hi Honey. I finally found what I was telling you about. Dr. Kisaragi had given it to me... - It's you guys! What are you doing!? - Uncle? Uncle!? What's wrong? I can't just sit here! Honey Flash! Oh nooo! I don't have enough energy! Darn it all, and I have nothing to wear! Well, this'll have to do. - What the...? - A garbage bag? Thank you very much. All right! My tummy's all full! So, here I go! Honey Flash! Emergency wide deployment, communication completed. Aqualine area blockade completed. Approval from the MLIT and the Tokyo governor received. Central Government and the Kanagawa troops are in position. Perfect. Trapped like a rat. Chief! Chief! Status report! Yes ma'am! For now, the professor is safe. - What are the kidnappers' demands? - Nothing so far. They're nuts to do this in broad daylight. I'll talk directly to them. Do you think you can get away under these conditions? We have you surrounded! Hmph, boring. Don't waste my time. What? I can't hear you! You're naïve. NAÏVE, I tell you! You'll never beat us Panther Claw like this. Panther Claw? That's right. I am Gold Claw, one of the Four Kings of Panther Claw. Just to kill time, I'll play with you! Chief! A battle means numbers and power! Fire! She's gone! What's wrong? That was close. Are you all right? Ah, thank God. Charge! Hey, don't get in my way! I can get out of this on my own! Sorry! They're persistent! Gold Claw! What is it? The professor escaped! What? See ya! A traitor? That minion hit me. You idiot! Follow them! There he is! He's over here! Gold Claw, we've captured the professor. You've wasted our time! Sorry! Ahem. You armored woman and suspicious gang! We have the professor. You've lost, so drop your weapons and surrender! Idiot! You're talking nonsense. The Professor is... Whoa! That is indeed Professor Uzuki! Which means... You! You're not Professor Uzuki, are you!? You're a little too slow, Panther Claw! Honey Flash! You! Who are you? I shall tell you, Panther Claw! Sometimes, she's a speeding biker. Other times, she's a Kisarazu police officer, a minion of Panther Claw, and even professor Uzuki's doppelganger. But in reality, she's... Soldier of Love, Cutie Honey! She's that trendy girl The one with the teeny butt Look this way, Honey Because, because... just because! Please, pretty please Don't hurt me My heart is going "tingle tingle" No, no no. Please don't look at me like that! Honey Flash! I'm transforming... Panther Claw, give it up now! Foolish girl. This will be fun! Here I go! She's that popular girl The one with bouncy boobs Look this way Honey Because, because... Just because! Please, pretty please Don't come near me My nose is going "twitch twitch" No, no, no. Please don't look at me like that! Honey Flash! You fight well, dearie. I'm ready any time! Gold Attack! That hurt. I did it! Why you little...! Playtime is over! Gold Missile! Stop messing with me! Where's the professor? I could have more fun, but I have a human to deliver. Goodbye, young girl! Not so fast! Honey Boomerang! Oww! This isn't happening! Uncle! Don't worry. He's just unconscious. Thank goodness. I'm Chief Natsuko Aki of the Eighth Division. You're under arrest. Arrested at 1122 hours. Aren't you arresting the wrong person? - Who are you? - I'm Seiji Hayami. - Who? - Reporter. Why is a civilian, let alone the media here? I dunno. He's also suspicious. Take him in. Yes, ma'am. I don't get any say? That's not fair. Both of you, come this way. Wow... Are you trying to get away? Yeah. I'm out of time. See ya! Honey Flash! Shoot. There goes our witness. Happiness doesn't come walking to you. That's why we walk towards it. Good morning! Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Not "good morning." It's "good afternoon." Okay. Good morning. Good God. Why won't they fire her already? Young people are so out of it these days. They have no energy. No leads - police stumped! Yummy. Miss Kisaragi. Yesh? Sorry! I'll choose between singing or eating. Don't do either. Please work. Work! Yes! Get up and serve tea. Yes! Right away. Ow! Let's see... who's the most tired? Here you go. Here. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Thanks. Here! I'm done! Jeez, you're a useless temp. First you give it to the section manager. Then the assistant manager, group manager, and assistant group manager. Then me, the chief. Then everyone else by age. When will you learn the basics? I thought this would make everyone happy. Are you stupid? How old are you? It's almost a year since I was re-born. What does that mean? Section manager, I think you should fire her. RESTRICTED ENTRY You think we're going to believe that!? RESTRICTED ENTRY You think we're going to believe that!? But it's the truth. Please approve that. We understand the situation at hand. The Tokyo Bay Aqualine was blown up, we've no idea when it will be back up, Serial Beauties Abduction Total of 10,000 Cases in Japan The Tokyo Bay Aqualine was blown up, we've no idea when it will be back up, Serial Beauties Abduction Total of 10,000 Cases in Japan and no idea who did it, and no leads! A major blunder! More Precious Metals Stolen Something's Wrong With the Police! With all this going on, the precious metal thievery, More Precious Metals Stolen Something's Wrong With the Police! Missing Girls Nationwide Reaches 10,000 Police Criticized For Lack of Investigation With all this going on, the precious metal thievery, Missing Girls Nationwide Reaches 10,000 Police Criticized For Lack of Investigation Missing Girls Nationwide Reaches 10,000 Police Criticized For Lack of Investigation and the serial abduction of young girls, the media's going to eat us alive! Gone Without A Trace and the serial abduction of young girls, the media's going to eat us alive! And the serial abduction of young girls, the media's going to eat us alive! I have a headache thinking about it. Perfect. Chief, some coffee? I don't need any. What should we do now? On call until further notice. "Miss Kisaragi, I'll leave it to you!! I'll give you 5 rice balls. Thanks." Since when do people think I'll do their work for rice balls? "Miss Kisaragi, I'll leave it to you!! I'll give you 5 rice balls. Thanks." Since when do people think I'll do their work for rice balls? Since when do people think I'll do their work for rice balls? "Please, I owe you 3 rice balls." Since when do people think I'll do their work for rice balls? But I like rice balls, so I guess it's okay. "I need it by tomorrow. I'll give you 7 rice balls. Thanks." But I like rice balls, so I guess it's okay. "I need it by tomorrow. I'll give you 7 rice balls. Thanks." - See you tomorrow. - Good night everyone! - Where should we go for dinner? - Let's go to a movie and eat afterwards. I'm so jealous of them. I want to go out with them too. But I have to finish today's work. Are you working overtime again? Yeah. I can't say no when they give me rice balls. Well, good luck. Here's a pick-me-up. Thank you, ma'am! So good! Your homemade rice balls are the best! I can help if you want. Oh, thanks. Leave it to me. Good morning, Mr. Cat. You came again. Hey. Are you listening? Oh, I should call uncle. Hello. Professor Utsugi now belongs to us, Panther Claw. If you need to get in touch with him, please give up and hang up now. What? Kidnapped again. This is why you can't trust others to do your job! Natsuko Aki. I guess I should get some leads from the lead! Kisaragi? Where is Kisaragi? She's not here. She said she's running late. Again? What the... What is she doing? Chief Natsuko Aki from the 8th division. I'm not telling you anything. I don't want the higher-ups to hate me like they do you. Oh, Chief! Please sign last month's bill! Good timing. Can you give me a report? Huh? You just... Well? - Proof? - What are you asking me about? - I'm not telling you anything. - Cut it out already! I thought the police would have some leads. You seem to be having some trouble, young lady. Oh, you're... Let me introduce myself. I'm Hayami Seiji, a reporter for the Daily News. Oh, thank you. You're a lot cuter than the rumors say. You are indeed qualified to be called Cutie Honey. - There's no need to use the I-system. - How do you know? That's part of my business. My job is to investigate the truth. What did you come here for? To give you a lead. Why to me? Because I'm on your side. On my side? The reason why all the minions disappeared... and why the Four Gods have super-human powers... is because they have nanomachines inside of them. You should know all about that. Hm. It's a system I've heard about before. Could it be...? Right. The same state-of-the-art technology... your late father, Professor Kisaragi, developed the I-System with. Then the Panther Claw must be after my... Right. Prof. Kisaragi refused to give them the info, and was murdered. This time, Professor Uzuki, who took over the experiment, was kidnapped. That's why my father was killed? And why Uncle was kidnapped? So, you want to know more? Yes, I do! The rest is all for trade. What was all that, then? A thank-you, and a sign of goodwill. What kind of trade? An exclusive interview with you. That's all I want. That... I would like to be in on. How did you know I can't refuse a favor from a woman, Nat-chan? - "Nat-chan!?" - "Nat-chan!?" Nat-chan. I see. Nat-chan. The mastermind group, secret organization Panther Claw. They are... They won't stop at anything to get what they want. The ultimate egotists. We don't know what they are, but they're definitely not human. They build weapons into their own bodies. So that's the secret organization Panther Claw. And their boss is? She's called Sister Jill. Sister Jill. Sister Jill Such a glorious beauty We live to serve you Panther Claw's ray of the new dawn With faith in your desire It's an honor to be your chosen one As nothing holds a candle to you You wish to fill the world with beauty We will serve faithfully Eternal Queen of Darkness It's been a long time, Lady Sister Jill. I am delighted that you have returned from Panther Zara's side. What!? You're gonna do it yourself? Of course. This is a job for the police. At least let us drive you back to headquarters. I'll walk. Footwork is key to investigations. Nat-chan, I'll help you. - I don't need your help. - I'm gonna help you! - Stop annoying me! - So stubborn. Then, we'll see you later. The only thing I can rely on is my organization. All right. Proceed as I instructed. It's been a long time, Sister Jill. I am extremely pleased that your beauty is unchanged. To celebrate your 2222nd awakening... The four of us present to you... ...small tokens of our appreciation. Black Claw. Cobalt Claw. Gold Claw! Scarlet Claw. First of all, we have 10,000 minions who are loyal to you, Sister Jill. For your dining pleasure this year, we've collected fresh young women. Behold, the beautiful and powerful golden weaponry you adore. And finally, a beautiful and massive new Jill Tower, your new residence. If there's anything you need, please let us know. We will prepare it for you as quickly as possible. Excuse us. Boring. Nothing has changed. It's still the same dull world. Lord Jill, there is one thing I would like you to know about. Those damn Panther Claw! I can't believe they got my father and uncle. You won't forgive them? Absolutely not! Revenge will just leave you feeling empty. You shouldn't do it. What do you mean? Hatred doesn't suit you. If that's what you were fighting for, your father probably wouldn't be happy. - Then what should I fight for? - You should find that out yourself. Meanie. Anyway, they're going to start attacking you directly. You need to be careful. They're a tough enemy. There's someone following us already? Sure is obvious, huh? Yes, not a problem. They haven't noticed us yet. Oh, they put on their hazards. Looks like they're stopping. The woman got out. - What should we do? - See ya! Follow her. Yes, ma'am! We're following her. What should we do? See ya! Yikes! I'm late! That light. It can't be! Oh? An unknown woman who calls herself Cutie Honey? She was able to take on the Four Gods. We believe she's related to the system. Interesting. Find her. As you wish. This report's useless. The professor's daughter died in an accident over a year ago. That's true. But the key to the I-System lies with that girl. Keep in close contact with her. I will soon enough. So... What's my next move? Good morning! It's not morning anymore! It's barely still afternoon! Why are you barely ever here? I'm sorry. Don't just say "I'm sorry." This is a company. I'm Aki Natsuko. A police officer. No mistake about it. It's the female officer who was there when Honey appeared. It looks like she's up to something. Talk about stating the obvious. Oh well. If we're wrong, we'll just kill her. You had a rice ball yesterday. I didn't! You were. Miss Kisaragi is staring at us like she's jealous. How scarry! It's probably because she has no friends to talk to. You have a visitor. This is a first, isn't it? Yeah! Oh! Nat-chan! See ya! Why are you running? Are you hiding something? No, not at all. I have something I want to ask you. I'm in the middle of work. I guess this isn't a good place. Come with me. Okay... I'm glad you finally made a friend. Here you go! Sorry, I only drink Blue Mountain coffee. Wow, what a snob. Then I will... What I wanted to ask you was... Hey, shhh! How pathetic. I hate women who cw. Stop it. Stop it. Fine, then. Men just like 'em young, right?! My mascara is running. What are you doing? Get back to work. Don't be messing around. Geez. I'm sorry. This place is no good. Come this way. Uh, okay. Damn it. I guess I have to go look for another guy. So back to the issue. I tried to look you up in the National Database, but there was nothing about you. Who are you? What is your relationship with Cutie Honey? Who is that reporter? Where are the Panther Claw? You better tell me everything this time! I'll do anything to get things done. Cool motto, huh? Who's calling me now? Oh, it's me. Seiji Hayami. Why do you know my cell phone number? Research is what I do! Anyway, you shouldn't move around too carelessly, Nat-chan. The enemy has their eye on you too. What do you mean? They're there. Panther Claw. Punch! The door is closing. Stop butting in. I can take care of myself in times like these. Sorry. What was that anyway? Someone you know? I know her, but I don't. Yeah, I don't know her... It's just too suspicious! I'll question you back at the station! What is this? Who left this here? Nat-chan! Now you can't escape anymore. Tell us about Honey. Or else... So speak up. I want to know about her! Oh, I guess we were wrong? Honey Flash! Mmm, belle du jour! Are you a Panther Claw? That's correct. One of the Panther Claw Four Gods, Cobalt Claw! I'll take your mysterious device... along with your head! I will avenge my father, Panther Claw! I won't give this to you. This girl is Cutie Honey? We take everything we want! Our style is to go after anything our hearts desire! Screw style! Why don't you think about other people's feelings for once? I caught you. That's a tres bien scream. That's why I can't stop killing people. You swine! Is this how you killed my father a year ago? I don't know. Do you remember what you ate an year ago? Panther Claw, I won't forgive you! That doesn't hurt me one bit. Oh no. I don't like hot things. It's hot!! How does it feel to be the one screaming? It hurts! It hurts! - You're okay. I'm glad. - I'm not okay at all! What's going on? And Honey? There's steam all over! That's no good! We need to hurry and get her out... of her transformed shape! Nat-chan, I'm counting on you! Hey, wait! NO SIGNAL What am I supposed to do? Hey you! Stop being transformed! No! If I stop now, I can't avenge my father! No! We must arrest criminals! Don't do anymore than that! Shut up! I won't forgive them! Hot! Hot! It seems that the anger and hatred in Lady Honey's heart... ...burned Lady Cobalt's body. I'm not interested in weak ones. But... That light from Lady Honey... There is no doubt Professor Kisaragi successfully used nanomachines... to dissolve and reform on the quark level. I can't believe a human found a way to maintain my beauty eternally. This world is one that can't be ignored. It's the first time we've seen you smile. Smile? That's of no concern to me. That's about its limit, since it's based on human cells. It's Honey's only weakness. Where am I? You're awake? Thank you. You saved me. So it would seem. Wow. I never bring people here. Anyway, that thing... I don't like to tell people about it. It's a present from my father. I lost my body a year ago in an accident. But I came back to life. All because of the I-System my father invented. I-System? Yeah. Imaginary Induction System. This choker is the main piece. So you're a robot? Or an android? This is...? I can't believe it. Like I said, I'm no different from a human. This body is a copy of my old one. But I don't remember much before that. I only remember my dad holding my hand. But I can always create new memories. The first outsider to learn the truth about Honey. Oh well. I'm sorry, Nat-chan. For getting you involved. Don't bother. It's part of my job. I learned today that a heart full of hatred is scam. A heart loving another person is just as scam. Really? If it's the same, I'd rather it be love. I get it. So this is what Seiji was talking about. I'm going to sleep. Okay. Good night. It seems my body is deteriorating faster than I thought. We must get the I-System as quickly as possible. As you wish. What the heck!? What? Wow. How nice! They're blooming nicely. It's really beautiful, Nat-chan. Mind your own business. Thanks. Hey. Hey. Why? What's wrong with them blooming? You used the I-System power, right? Yep. I-System increases life activity. But it can't create new life. That's why I like things that have life. Then there's no point. You make flowers bloom by caring for them. Sorry. If your wounds are healed, can you leave? Sweet sweet Honey... Sweet sweet Honey... Sweet sweet Honey... Sweet sweet Honey... Someone is calling for Honey Coming through the night sky When I turn around, I'm alone All there is is darkness When was it? We looked up at the stars together. It's okay This is okay That's right. I knew it'll be this way Someone is calling for Honey Honey Honey I've heard that voice before Sweet sweet honey... If I stay here, I'll only get these people involved too. I can't stay here anymore. Excuse me. Have we met before? No, we haven't! I put pressure on the Japanese government and the Foreign Ministry... Everything is going as you planned. Thank you. The report's due soon. Maybe you should hurry it up a bit? Don't worry. I will meet the deadline, to the best of my ability. Miss Natsuko Aki, sometimes organizations aren't as reliable as you think. Starting tomorrow, we are assigning you to the serial abduction case. Why? The American Government is getting impatient. They're going to investigate the Professor's case themselves. And you want me to take responsibility for that? You were the person in charge, so of course. You did what you could. Well, we aren't expecting much from the younger ones on the force. We'll inform you of your discipline later. Wait. Leave your weapon behind. Natsuko Aki Even if I try to attack, I don't have any leads. But I can't think of anything on my own. I guess I should go depend on someone then. C'mon in. So? What do you want? Let's not be too difficult. Have some sake. Sake? That's right. I did some research on you. Your favorite flower is the cosmos. Your favorite word is "perfection." Your favorite alcohol is sake. Especially local sake from Yamaguchi. You're missing one thing: I don't like reporters. And sorry, but I like to drink alone. Just like your work. I'm sad that you won't be nice to someone so considerate of you. Good morning! Wh-Why are you here? I called Seiji, and he told me to come here. Did I do something wrong? Just the timing. I don't get it, but I'm sorry, Nat-chan! Whatever. I decided not to get involved with you. But we met again, like destiny. Destiny? No! It's all the plot of the reporter! But we met again. Be quiet! Then I'll talk to myself. Nat-chan should enjoy life more. Especially since she's alive and all. Oh, shut up! Hey! Why are you drinking that!? And drinking so fast! Is this girl okay with alcohol? We'll know soon enough. Guess not. Oh, how annoying! I told you I hate women who cw! Then Nat-chan, you should smile more. C'mon! Oh yeah! For future reference, I should look around a man's room some more! No, you can't go in there, Honey. Here I come! You really were researching me, Seiji. I wonder about those two. She's downing it so fast. She's downing it too. Oh, dammit. I can't stand it anymore. I'm gonna sing! Don't you have karaoke? - Karaoke? - Yeah! It's a suite, isn't it? At least have it ready. Hey you! Make a karaoke machine with your Honey Flash! Ka. Ra. O. Ke. The winter scenery of the Tsugaru Strait Chu chu chu Summer girl, the bikini looks very good on you. It's too stimulating! About this time tomorrow, I'll be on the train! All right, that should be enough. I'm beat! Lady Honey has a heart like a human's. And she has some relationship with Professor Uzuki. It will be better to have her come to us. With everything going on at the station, I sleep in a man's room on my first visit and wake up with a hangover. I'm the worst. Yeah, you're such a whore. Stop adding to my monologue. I know your pattern now, Nat-chan. Shut up! Mind your own business! See? What's wrong, Honey? What happened to Nat-chan? I wonder if Nat-chan hates me? No, she's just hesitant. She's always acted fierce to keep others away from her. So she doesn't know what to do when someone like you keeps bothering her. I see. Then what about me? You're Honey! You're just fine as you are. It's this one. Lady Honey Kisaragi. We have a message from our master, Sister Jill. We'd like to invite you to Jill Tower. Wait! Where's that? The details are in the invitation. Please come in formal attire. Thank you. Three invitations, huh? Then the other person is? If this will be of any help to you... When you're on the force for so long, you have connections. Remember that. If they find out, you'd be disciplined. The top only looks at the paperwork. If the numbers are right, no problem. - Remember that. - Yes, sir. Also, here's the background on that reporter. He really dug deep. I'm only good at hacking. I see. It all makes sense now. Thank you, both of you. "Thank you"? First time I've gotten one. I'll remember that. I have some errands to run. See you later. All right. Take care, Seiji. See ya! Have a good one. I guess I should get dressed too. Nat-chan! You look great! I knew you'd come here. What's with your hair? And the tag's still on! Hmmm. It's no good? I couldn't get it right myself. I tried curling it with my fingers. Why don't you take care of it by Honey Flash? Yeah, but I don't want to cheat anymore. I should do things on my own. I guess I have to do it. Come here. Right! Nat-chan, you're good. Of course. I try my best to do everything on my own. That's so you. There, I'm done. Thank you. Your glasses are still broken! That's fine. - It's not fine! - It's fine. It is not! Hey! These aren't prescription! They're fake! Shut up. I'll fix it. I thought you stopped cheating. For myself. But there's nothing I won't do for others! You look good in glasses, Nat-chan, but you're cute without them too. Mind your own business. Here. Anyway, I'm going to rescue the professor myself. We can go together. I appreciate it, but I want to go alone. But... Okay. Then good luck, Nat-chan! See ya! Here I go. Sister Jill. I'll bring her to you this time. Gold Claw. Yes ma'am. There is no need for you to go. Please forgive me, Lady Sister Jill! It was my error to lose to that girl once, but please give me another chance! How pathetic. To end a career asking for forgiveness. How ugly. Then I will prepare a stage to invite the young miss. It's time. The beautiful Tokyo Tower! Who's there? We've been waiting for you, Lady Honey. Panther Claw! Where is Uncle Uzuki? What you seek is over there. Uncle! Uncle? Do not worry. We just asked his head about the I-System directly. You mean, his memory? We took it. We thought it would be best to get rid of his memories. Uncle! Are you all right? It's me! It's Honey Kisaragi! That watch... it was my father's. Uncle. Oh, even though his memories are gone, he must have had some love left in him. Of course! Even if you take someone's life, or their precious memories, nothing... nothing can take away love! Love, huh? Love is unnecessary for Lady Jill. All she needs is the I-System, and nothing else. Then I'll defeat you all! But will you be able to, Madam? I will have to! Honey Flash! Wonderful! This light must be brought to Lady Jill! Here I come, Panther Claw! I have to hurry to the professor. Hey you. I can't let you go any further. This Scarlet Claw will take your head! That surprised me. What a view. Oh, what a view! This can be done only with my Scarlet Beam. Powerful as always. If you avoid it again, it'll create a better view. It's time to get that head of yours. Ow, that hurt. I'm having a horrible time. You little... you'll pay for this over there! This is Jill's true form. When you seek the perfect cell, you end up with vegetable matter. That's it for my work. I feel bad for my client, but I'll have to use it here. Oh, help me, Black Claw! If you have the strength to get back here, why didn't you fight? It's your turn. Kill her, quick. Kill kill kill! How ugly- She doesn't know how inferior she is. Ah, only when you defeat the strong ones, will you feel the ultimate power within you. Ah, for the sake of my own happiness, please whither away beautifully, baby. Ah, I am.. I am the most powerful fighter, Black Claw! I am now here! I'll cut out the second verse. Let's go, Honey! Nat-chan, are you okay? I took care of my other chores, so I can join you soon. I'm going first. I have to save the professor. What's that? Those are the women who were caught here. The serial abduction was them too? Yeah, I cut loose the ones that were part of Jill's main body. To break Jill's energy, I used the anti-nanomachine. Wonderful. Superb, Honey. This fight, this pleasure. I'm feeling it for the first time. Add fuel to my burning desire. More! Sorry! Black Tornado! You can't run away. Panther Claw. Give back Professor Utsugi at once! That's fine. But there's one condition. Don't, Nat-chan! Natsuko! Now, let's continue having fun. Give me the pleasure of stopping a life with my very own hands! My energy is running low. Honey. You did well. I praise you. Please father... Protect me. Oh no! I'm getting dizzy! In this world, what creates power is desire! Beauty... and darkness... I've achieved enlightenment and combined them. That's why... I'll never lose! Farewell. Honey Boomerang! I have to continue. I have to go save him. I have to go on... I'm here. Give me back my uncle! Your wish is granted. Uncle! But this person is in his place. Nat-chan! Don't worry about me. Get out of here! You might be able to withstand it... but will she be able to? I think it would be smart to hand over the I-System. Hurry up and escape! Go now! No, I won't go. I have to save you. Don't bother with me. Is this love as well? Enough. As you wish. You've finally come, Cutie Honey. You must be Sister Jill. Yes, I am the one who holds eternal life and beauty. I am... Sister Jill. Honey, the I-System you hold is marvelous. But what about you? You, like me, live eternally. Why don't you rise above humanity? I don't need to. A pity. But if you don't want to rise above, then I will overtake your power. That power is worthy of me, who has risen above mankind. Come. Come to my realm. I had long lost my desire and jealousy. I thank you for bringing those feelings back into me, Cutie Honey. I will allow you to become a part of my body along with the I-System... and live with me eternally. Fine. But let go of Nat-chan. As you wish. Save Nat-chan... Save Nat-chan... Save Nat-chan... Please... Save... Save Nat-chan... Please... Save Nat-chan... Stop... Stop it! Stop it! Honey! Don't give up, Honey! Use the I-System! And believe! Believe in Professor Kisaragi! The love of your father! No, it's too late. Honey has already begun merging with Sister Jill. She is being reborn as part of Jill's origin, the tree of life. It's wonderful. Reporter! Do you have a gun? - Here. There's only one bullet. - That's enough. Honey! I take back what I said! We'll do it together! Your choker! Honey Flash! I get it. This is my father's love. I don't get it! I had thrown away love, that weak part of humans. And I was trying to lead you to being perfection, but why do you reject it? What a comfortable feeling. Is this your heart? It's not only mine. It's everyone's... the heart that loves. Love, huh? How do you attain that? That's the feeling I don't understand. It's easy. You must learn to love something yourself. Thanks, daddy. See ya! Honey! Are you all right? I'm glad you're safe. Honey! You called my name for the first time. I'm so happy. No. I thought you don't like women who cw. You're going to live a boring life that will last an eternity. You will have to witness the unchanging foolishness of humanity. Lady Honey, you will continue to live forever, and will go through the same pain that my lord has known. Oh, that won't happen. Because I love these people and the world. I see. Please go, Lady Honey. I will stay with Lord Jill for eternity. It's all over. No, we don't know your true identity. That anti-nanomachine you mentioned. You were going to use it to capture Honey, weren't you? That's correct. Honey, be careful about this guy. He's actually... I know. What was it... An agent with the American NSA, right? If you knew, why... Because, he said he was on my side. Thank you, Honey. Chief! Chief! Chief! You saved me. Thank you, Goki, Todoroki. And I'd like to thank you, Honey. Oh, I didn't do anything to deserve your gratitude. Nat-chan, you're cute when you smile. I agree! And what are you going to do now? Right. Maybe I'll start a private investigation office with Honey. Of course! I'm all for it! Thank you, Honey. So please help us too. Hmph. You'll just be investigating cheating spouses. But, if I have to... Then we should get straight to work. I'll introduce you. This is Goki. Hello. This is my card. Oh, thank you. And this is Todoroki. Nice to meet you! - I'm opening a detective agency. - Yes! Honey, what are you doing? We're going! Come on! Okay!
