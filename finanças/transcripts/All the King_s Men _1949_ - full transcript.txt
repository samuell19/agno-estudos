Burden. Hey, Jack Burden! The boss wants to see you. Hey, Jack, ever hear of a fellow called Willie Stark? No. Who'd he shoot? Looks like it'll be the other way around if he keeps it up. He's really got the boys in the Kanoma County courthouse worried. A politician, huh? What's he running for? Oh, county, uh, treasurer or something like that. What's so special about him? They say he's an honest man. What I want you to do is to hop into your car... You promised me a vacation. Oh, that can wait. Yeah, but there's a girl I know... Oh. Well, she can wait too. The question is, can I? And the answer is, get up there. Right. Oh, um, what'd you say his name was? Hmm? The fella's name. Oh, the, um... Stark. Willie Stark. Willie Stark. I found him in Kanoma City... a typical hot, dusty, backwoods county seat. ... to lie to them in order to line their own pockets with the taxpayers' money. When have the citizens of Kanoma County ever witnessed a campaign like this? Why is the opposition so anxious to defeat me? Why have they used every dirty method known to make sure I'm not elected county treasurer? Well, I'll tell ya why. Because they're afraid of the truth, and the truth is this: They're trying to steal your money. Yeah, I said "steal." The county commissioners rejected the low bid on the schoolhouse. Why? Well, they'll tell you their reason is the job will be done better. The county commissioners would have you believe that they're interested in public welfare. They're interested in welfare, sure... but it's their own. Let's look at their reason in the light of the facts and the figures. That brick factory is owned by a brother-in-law of one of the commissioners. That same brick factory uses convict labor. Sorry, Willie. You'll have to move on. Why? City ordinance number 105: More than five people congregating is disturbing the peace. If you folks'll be so kind as to read these handbills, my boy'll pass 'em out among you. There's an ordinance against that too. Pass 'em out, Tom. Let him alone! Get that camera! Willie, you're under arrest. Where can I find Tiny Duffy? Right over there, mister. They told me I could get my camera back here. Who told you that? People. Can I? You the reporter that's been snoopin' around town? Are you Tiny Duffy? What paper? Chronicle. You sure come a long way to stick your nose into other people's business. That's true, only my boss on the paper can't see it that way. It ain't any of his business either. Whose business is it? Them as is tendin' to it... county commissioners the voters of Kanoma County elected to attend to their business... and not take no buttin' in from nobody. You a commissioner? Yeah. Name's Pillsbury. Dolph Pillsbury. Me too. I'm a commissioner too. Who isn't a commissioner? He's the head man. Oh, then you're in a position to know... He's in a position to know nothin' and to say nothin'. I thought you said he was head man. He uses my head. Oh, Tiny, you're a card. Ain't he a card? Yeah, he's a card. Now, who thought up those city ordinances about arresting someone for making a speech? Who's arrested? Ain't nobody arrested. Hi, Willie. Hi, Willie. Did you apologize to Willie? Yeah, I apologized to Willie. Did you give him his handbills back? Yeah, I gave 'em back. Give him back his flag and his bag, and give this man his camera. I'm gonna be on that same street corner tomorrow, Mr. Duffy. You go right ahead, Willie. We all believe in free speech. We got to... it's in the Constitution. My boy is out distributing those handbills now. It's a free country, Willie. If you can convince the people to vote for you, you go right ahead. What did you want to see me about, Mr. Duffy? I wanted you to meet a fellow that came all the way up from the state capital to meet you... a reporter. Wants to write you up, maybe put your picture in the paper. I'm happy to know you, sir. Burden's my name... Jack Burden. Can we go somewhere where we can talk? Oh, that ain't polite. Don't you want to hear both sides of the story? I know your side. What happened to the slate your men took from my camera? Must have dropped out. Oh, come on, fellas, let's relax. It's a hot day. Hey, Sugar Boy! Yeah? Bring some cold beer for the boys. None for me, thank you kindly. Now, you know Willie don't drink, Tiny. His wife don't favor drinkin'. And Willie's the teacher's pet, ain't you, Willie? I'll have some orange pop if you don't mind. Orange pop? All right, Sugar Boy, bring him some orange pop. Th-The p-pop's s-s-sold out. Did you hear that, boys? The p-p-pop is s-sold out. Now, ain't he a card? He stutters, Mr. Duffy, but you... you don't say anything. Let's go, mister. This is my wife, Lucy, Mr. Burden. How do you do? That's my pa. How do you do? Now we'll talk. You've been talking for a long time, Mr. Stark. Willie's got a lot to say. You sleepy, Pappy? You want to have a nap? No, I want to hear it. I'm worried about Tom. It's getting dark. He should have been home. He's a strong boy. Don't worry about him. He can take care of himself. How old is the boy? Fifteen. How long have you been married? Nine years. He was a neighbor's boy. They were poor folks... both died. I couldn't have any children, so... He's a good boy. Oh, he's the best. I couldn't love him any more if he was my own flesh and blood. And now you, Mrs. Stark. There isn't very much to tell about me. How did you meet? I was teaching school, and one day a pupil walked in. It was Willie. I couldn't have a grown man in the class, and Willie wanted to learn so badly, so I married him. Is that the only reason? Except that I loved him. Get the coffee, Lucy. When did they fire you, Mrs. Stark? A couple of weeks ago. I'd been teaching a long time, and nobody ever said I wasn't all right. But I don't care. I don't want to teach in a schoolhouse... that they built just so somebody can steal some money. Willie doesn't want to be treasurer, either, if he has to associate with those dishonest people. I'm gonna run. They can't keep me from runnin'. If you don't mind the truth, Mr. Stark, you haven't much of a chance. I'm gonna run. They're not gonna kick me around like I was dirt. I don't care if Willie loses, just so he gets the truth to the people. Isn't that true, Willie? Isn't it, Willie? Hmm? Yeah, yeah, sure. That's right. Well, if you lose, you can give a little more time to studying your law books. - Are you studying law too? - By myself at night. Willie's a smart boy. If I ever find the time, I'm gonna take a course at the university. What happened, Tommy boy? What's the matter? I gave out the handbills, Pa. Speak up. Speak up! Let him tell it in his own way. Go on, Tommy. This time they were waitin' for me. They threw 'em in the dirt and beat me up. I brought some of 'em back. Good boy. Have you eaten yet, Tom? Let him wash up first. Why don't you lie down, Pappy? I'm gonna run. You're not gonna stop me. I'm gonna run even if I don't get a single vote. Here you are... the last of the Willie Stark articles. Now can I go? Yes, you've earned your vacation. You've been writing these like you really mean them. I do. I hadn't been home in a long time. Home was Burden's Landing, only 130 miles from Kanoma City. It was separated from the mainland by a body of water. For the first time, I wondered if it wasn't separated by more than that. Hello, Mother. Floyd, Jack's home. Oh, he looks fine. Doesn't he look fine? How do I look, Jackie boy? You look beautiful, Mother. I've got so many things planned for you... parties, and... it'll be just like old times... but first let's have a drink. - Can't that wait till this evening? - Floyd, honey, my son's home. - How long you plan on staying? - Two or three weeks, if that's all right with you. - I'm sure your father would be... - Stepfather, Mother. Now, Jackie. Here we all are. Floyd, Jackie, myself. To the best time we've ever had together. Yes, Mother. Excuse me, I... Dr. Stanton, I presume. Is my shingle showing? Good to see you, boy, very good. Good to see you, Judge. How've you been? What have you been doing? Oh, just sitting here, waiting for all of you to come home. You know, when a man starts to get old, his eyes stray and play funny tricks on him. As I watched you in that boat, I thought sure I saw a boy of 12 with a fishing rod in his hands, and I was sure the first thing he'd say would be... Do you mind if I kiss your niece, sir? To all the good times we've had together at Burden's Landing, and especially this one, because my son's home. Thank you, Mother. Thank you very much. Monty, Anne and I have been discussing Jack's career. What do you think? Shall he be a lawyer? Doctor? We were just discussing... I like what I'm doing, Mother. You do very well at it. I read your articles about this fellow... Willie Stark. Very convincing. Too convincing for my tastes. A lot of people like them. A lot of people are fools. Articles like that shouldn't be permitted. They only tend to incite people. - What are you afraid of? - I thought they were very good. I was proud of you, Jack. I was particularly interested in Stark's ideas on health and medicine. You know the conditions at the hospital I work in. They're intolerable. I'd like to meet this Willie Stark. He sounds like an honest man. "Honest man"? This state is full of these log-cabin Abe Lincolns with price tags on them. The louder he yells, the higher his price. You think you can buy anything, don't you? Yes. Don't you? - What do you think, Judge? - I think this state could stand a few changes. - Well, I'll tell you what I think. - Oh, please. - Let-Let's not talk politics. - Anne is right. I absolutely forbid any more of it. I know what we need. We need another toast. You propose it, Monty. You're so good at it. To the young people... to Anne, to Jack, to Adam... to what lies before them, to the world they'll make in spite of mistakes we've made. The mistakes you've made, not me. You're all still pretty high and mighty, aren't you? You all think this state needs a change. You don't like the way it's run. Well, who's going to run it... Willie Stark, the judge, you? You can be bought too... as a matter of fact, you have been, and with my money. That's a waste of good liquor, boy. Your mother wouldn't approve. Jack... You go back and apologize. Apologize? I'd rather die. I've got to live with him. Well, I don't. Neither do you. You don't love him... never did. Son, don't spoil anything now. He can help you. I can get along without him. You need this house and the parties and the cars and the clothes and the lies. I don't. It's the truth, Mother. Face it. For once in your life, face it. Anne, please... please make him understand. Anne, Burden's Landing is a place on the moon. It isn't real. It doesn't exist. It's me pretending I live on what I earn. It's my mother... trying to keep herself young and drinking herself old doing it. It's you and Adam living in this house as though your father were still alive. It's an old man like the judge dreaming of the past. Oh, Anne, come away with me. And do what? Live in a shack and eat red beans. Anne, what do you want me to do? Oh, Jack, you haven't been sure. You've gone from one thing to the other... a year at law school and now this job as a reporter. Are you afraid I can't make a living? Oh, no, Jack, it isn't that. I don't care about the money. It's just that I... I want you to be something. What is it you want me to be? I don't know. It's just that I want you to be... to do... something important. Like your father? All right, I'll run for governor. Anne, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said that. All right, Jack. I'll go away with you. I'll do anything you want me to. Anne... I've wanted you to say that more than anything in the world, and now that you have said it... Anne, I guess you were right. I'm not sure of anything, including myself. I'm not sure I could live up to the... Oh... Anne, wait for me. Please wait for me. I'll wait for you. Hello, Jack. Cut your vacation short, didn't you? Yeah. By the way, Jack, the fellow you wrote the articles about... uh, Stark... Yeah? He lost. Well, I guess that's the end of Willie Stark. ...measure of the damages is caused by... A breach... a breach... of an agreement... of an agreement... to sell personal property... to sell... Oh, two years of this. Oh, go on, Willie, go on. Willie Stark, Bachelor of Law. If you'll just let me take your case... Really, I'll wait for my fee just as long as you want me to. Go on, Willie, go on. They're not gonna kick me around like I was dirt. If you lose, you can give more time to studying your law books. Willie's got a lot to say. I'll be on that street corner tomorrow, Mr. Duffy. We all believe in free speech. Free country, Willie. That brick factory is owned by a brother-in-law... of one of the commissioners... The county commissioners rejected the low bid in the schoolhouse. All right, children, this is a fire drill. Remember, now, walk. Quietly. "Verily I say unto you, accept ye turn and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter the Kingdom of Heaven." Let us pray. The grace of our Lord, Jesus Christ, and the love of God... and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with us all evermore. Amen. O Lord, I'm punished for voting against an honest man. God bless you, Willie. If we'd only listened to you, Willie. We'll never forget you, Willie. You were right, Willie. Let me shake your hand, Willie. We should've listened. We should've listened. Willie, you were right all the time. "A voice in the wilderness." "A man named Willie Stark." How 'bout that, Lucy? That's me. Get up there, and get up there fast. Your friend Willie's hotter than a firecracker. Stay with him! Look, before this Kanoma City business, we had this whole area tied up. Now we're losing the hick vote. Then let's find a way to split that vote. Well, all I know is, the way it is now, it looks like I'm not gonna win. I know a way! Find a dummy. "Find a dummy"? That's what we got. A guy from the sticks strong enough to grab some votes... and dumb enough not to ask questions. If you wanna listen to a boy from the sticks, I know just the guy. So it's no more politics, huh, Willie? No. No, I've worked too hard in my time to get there. I think I'll just go on practicin' law and makin' a little more money. The question I'd like to ask is, why all the speeches you're making around the countryside? I wonder who that is. Brought some people all the way up from the state capital, Willie, just to meet ya. Folks, I want you to meet Willie Stark, the next governor of our state. Folks, bear with me for a couple of minutes. I'd like to tell you what this state needs. It needs a balanced tax program. Now I'd like to give you the facts and the figures. How'd it sound, Jack? Fine, Willie. Fine. Say, I forgot to send a telegram to Lucy. Conductor! Now right here... right here I'd like to add something about last year's taxes. I wouldn't add a thing. Just give 'em the facts. Yeah, and the figures. Great speech. What this state needs is a balanced tax program. Last year... last year the state claimed to have spent on roads... You all know that figures don't lie, and you know that facts are easy to understand. Do you mind if I sit with you, Sadie? Stand, sit. Thanks. Tell me, what are you on this merry-go-round for? I take notes. For whom? For those "whom" pay me. Which is? People. Smart people. Yeah. Anybody that pays me is smart. You don't have to be smart to frame a guy like Willie Stark. No. No, brother, you don't. It is a frame, isn't it? Why don't you give me a cigarette? To split the vote and win the election for Harrison, huh? If you know, why you ask? I just want to make sure. Yeah. Look, why don't you tell the boys home to save their money? Willie couldn't steal a vote from Abe Lincoln in the cradle of the Confederacy. I wish the poor had enough sense to have somebody give him a good greasing... for the beating he's going to get; this way all he gets out of it is the ride. Hey, those speeches... ain't they awful? Ain't they just plain awful? Question to you: If somebody told him he was a sucker, do you think he'd quit? I don't know, Sadie. I really don't know. Did it sound all right, Mr. Burden? Fine, Willie. Fine. Now, friends, if you will bear patiently with me for a few minutes, I'll give you the figures. - What we need is a balanced tax program. - No, Willie, no! - What I need is some sleep! Shut up! - Shut up yourself! Listen, Willie, try it on your feet this time. Oh, no, my feet are killin' me. Let me stay here, huh? All right. Look, Willie, you tell them too much. Just tell them you're gonna soak the fat boys and forget the rest of the tax stuff. That's what I say. But it's the way you say it. Willie, make 'em cry, make 'em laugh, make 'em mad... even mad at you. Stir them up, and they'll love it and come back for more. But for heaven's sakes, don't try to improve their minds. A man don't have to be governor. What? A man don't have to be governor. Well, they haven't counted the votes yet. I'm gonna lose, Mr. Burden. I know that. Don't try and fool me. I'm not gonna lie to you... I wanted it. I wanted it so badly, I-I stayed up nights thinkin' about it. A man wants somethin' so badly, he gets mixed up in knowin' what he wants. It's somethin' inside of you. I would have made a good governor... better than those other fellas. Come in. A great governor. If you won't let me sleep, you might give me a drink. Build highways... greatest system of highways in the country. Help yourself. I'd build 'em schools. What's up? Nothing, except Willie here's been saying as how he's not gonna be governor. - So you told him. - I don't tell anyone anything. I just listen. Who told you? Told me what? Told me what? That you're not going to be governor. Jack, told me what? Told me what? All right! That you've been framed, you poor sap. Framed? And how. Oh, you decoy... you woodenhead decoy. And you let 'em! You know what you are? Well, you're the goat. You are the sacrificial goat. You are a sap because you let 'em. Sadie, that's enough. Enough? He didn't even get anything out of it. Oh, they'd have paid you to take a rap like that. But they didn't have to pay a sap like you. Oh, no. You were so full of yourself and hot air, all you wanted was a chance to stand up on your hind legs and make a speech. "My friends... "My friends, what this state needs is a good five-cent cigar. What this state needs is a..." Is it true? He wants to know if it's true. Is it true? That's what they tell me. Here. Lay off. You're not used to it. He's not used to a lot of things, are you, Willie? Why don't you lay off him, Sadie? Are you, Willie? Are you? Are ya, are ya, are ya, are ya? Hi. Well, things seem to have quieted down. Yeah, I quieted him down. Yeah. How was he... noisy? Oh, he reared some. He's been tellin' me all the things he's gonna do. He's gonna do big things, this fella. He's gonna be president. He's gonna kill people with his bare hands. I quieted him down. Hey, who's Lucy? His wife. He talks like she's his mammy. She's gonna blow his nose for him. Well, I'll take it from here on in. They're waiting for him at the barbecue. Yeah. Well, give me a receipt for the body. I'll be on my way. Hey, Willie. Willie. Come on, wake up, Willie. Come on, Willie. ♪♪Where is he? There he is. Whoops. Is he drunk? Never touches the stuff. Lucy doesn't favor drinkin'. How'd you get him here? He was out stiff. Hair of the dog that bit him. "Hair"? He must have swallowed the dog. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce that true man of the people, the next governor of the state, Willie Stark! My friends... My friends, I have a speech here. It's a speech about what this state needs. There's no need in my telling you what this state needs. You are the state, and you know what you need. You over there, look at your pants. Have they got holes in the knees? Listen to your stomach. Did you ever hear it rumble for hunger? And you... What about your crops? Did they ever rot in the field... because the road was so bad you couldn't get 'em to market? And you... What about your kids? Are they growin' up ignorant as dirt... ignorant as you... 'cause there's no school? Nah, I'm not gonna read you any speech. But I am gonna tell you a story. Hey, what's he up to? Shut up. Get ready to bust your sides laughin', 'cause it's sure a funny story. It's about a hick... a hick like you, if you please... yeah, like you. He grew up on the dirt roads and the gully washes of a farm. He knew what it was to get up before dawn and get feed and slop and milk before breakfast, then set out before sunup and walk six miles to a one-room, slab-sided schoolhouse. Oh, this hick knew what it was to be a hick, all right. He figured if he was gonna get anything done, well, he had to do it himself. So he sat up nights and studied books, studied law. He thought he might change things some... for himself and for folks like him. Now, I'm not gonna lie to you. He didn't start off thinking about the hicks... and all the wonderful things he was gonna do for them... no. No, he started off thinking of number one. But something came to him on the way. How he could do nothing himself without the help of the people... that's what came to him. And it also came to him, with the powerful force of God's own lightning, back in his county when the school collapsed because it was made of politics' rotten brick... It killed and mangled a dozen kids. But you know that story. The people were his friends because he fought that rotten brick. And some of the politicians down in the city, they knew that. So they rode up to his house in a big fine car and said they wanted him to run for governor. Sadie, he's wonderful... wonderful! So they told this hick, and he swallowed it. He looked in his heart, and he thought, in all humility, how he'd like to try and change things. He was just a country boy who thought even the plainest, poorest man can be governor... if his fellow citizens find he's got the stuff for the job. Well, those fellows in the striped pants, they saw that hick... and they took him in. Willie! What are you trying... There he is! There's your Judas Iscariot! Look at him! Lickspittle, nose-wiper! Look at him! Look at him! Play! Play anything! Joe Harrison's dummy! Look at him! That's a lie! Look at him! - Come get him, boys! Come get him! - Look at him! Look at him! Go get him! Now, shut up! Shut up, all of you! Now, listen to me, you hicks. Yeah, you're hicks too, and they fooled you a thousand times just like they fooled me. But this time I'm gonna fool somebody. I'm gonna stay in this race. I'm on my own, and I'm out for blood. Now, listen to me, you hicks! Listen to me and lift up your eyes and look at God's blessed and un-flyblown truth... And this is the truth: You're a hick, and nobody ever helped a hick but a hick himself. All right, listen to me! I'm the hick they were gonna use to split the hick vote. But I'm standin' right here now on my hind legs. Even a dog can learn to do that. Are you standing on your hind legs? Have you learned to do that much yet? Here it is! Here it is, you hicks! Nail up anybody who stands in your way! Nail up Joe Harrison! Nail up McMurphy! And if they don't deliver, give me the hammer, and I'll do it myself! I want his throat cut from ear to ear. No use going any further, Jack. We're not printing them anymore. I thought the Chronicle line was... "Divide and conquer." Stark is getting too big for his britches, and the hicks are getting too smart. We're now supporting Harrison. How do you square that? I work here. Well, I don't... not anymore. Jack, you fool. If you had any guts you'd print this. I work here. I take orders. I know. You got a wife and three kids, and your boy goes to Princeton. You won't find it easy to get another job. I'm too rich to work. We didn't do so good. Double bourbon. Same for me. And a beer. Hear you got fired from the paper. You heard wrong. I quit. You're smart, 'cause before I'm through with that mob, they're not gonna have enough money left to pay the boy that cleans the spittoons. How do you feel, Willie? I feel fine, fine. You see, Jack, I learned something. Yeah? What? How to win. I didn't see Willie again until his second campaign, four years later. I drifted from job to job... that is, whenever I could find one... but always further and further away from Anne... and the life at Burden's Landing. But Willie wasn't drifting. He knew where he was going. He had his foot in the door, and he kept right on pushing to get in. He had lost the election, but he'd won the state, and he knew it, and the people knew it. They were all hopping on his bandwagon... even Tiny Duffy. Yep, Willie came back like he said he would. You wanna know what my platform is? Here it is. I'm gonna soak the fat boys, and I'm gonna spread it out thin. Willie was right... he'd learned how to win, and he spent a lot of money doing it... an awful lot of money. I was beginning to wonder where he got it from. There were rumors throughout the state that Willie was making deals with all kinds of people... strange deals... for Willie Stark. The second time out, it wasn't a campaign; it was a slaughter. It was Saturday night in a mining town. Yep, Willie came back like he said he would. He came back, and he took me with him. This is Jack Burden, a friend of mine. He's gonna live here. Give him anything he wants. Let these boys through, officers. Duffy works for me now. Looks like everybody works for you. No, not yet. But I wanna keep him around. He reminds me of something I never wanna forget. Come on, come on, come on, come on. These the boys? These are the boys that can get the boys. How many you think you can get? Fifty. How much? Five dollars a head. What do you think, Sugar? They look like good boys? They b-better be. Get a hundred. All right, go on, all of you. Blow. Blow. Blow. You too, Duffy. Go on. Handbill distributors. If they all look like them, I'd hate not to take one. That's the object. Not like when they beat up my boy, Tom. How is Tom? Oh, he's fine. He starts college in the fall. Oh. And Lucy? Fine, fine. Hey, I need a boy! Where's a boy? Take that downstairs. They're waiting for it. Right away. On the double. Listen, baby, you gotta double-space all of this. He can't read it, see? This is for you. They need four copies. Hi, Jack! Sadie! How are you? Sadie's my secretary now. Oh, pardon me. Fix your tie, Willie. Hey, Sugar. Huh? Keep everybody outta here. I want to talk to Jack and Sadie alone. Now you're gonna work for me. Doin' what? I don't know. Something'll turn up. Won't it, Sadie? Yeah. We need a college man around... for research. How much did they pay you on that newspaper? Three hundred dollars a month. I could buy you cheap, couldn't I? For a bag of salt. No. No, I don't play that way. I like you, boy. I always have. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you $400 a month and traveling expenses. You throw money around like it was money. Money. I don't need money. - People give me things. - Why? Because they believe in me. I was going home again, but this time it was different. Now I had a feeling that maybe the waiting was over... for me and for Anne. It's a far cry from where I come from to this house, and, standing here under the portrait of one of the greatest governors of this state, talking to you people... well, it's an honor I never thought I'd have. Are there any questions? Mr. McEvoy? No. I have no questions. - Judge? - A few, but it will hold. - I have a question. - Shoot. A lot of people in this state have been saying that you've been making deals... some of them with the very groups you claim you're against. Is that true? Adam, you know how rumors start. Yes. Yes, that's true. I have nothing to hide. I'll make a deal with the devil if it'll help me carry out my program. But believe me, there are no strings attached to those deals. You're sure about that? Doc, Jack here has been telling me how you feel about things... how you'd like to see the sick people in this state given a break, how you'd like to see a new hospital built... a hospital that's the biggest and best that money can buy. You want those things, Doc, because... well, because you're a man who wants to do good. - Now I'd like to ask you a question. - Shoot. Do you know what good comes out of? You tell me, Mr. Stark. Out of bad... that's what good comes out of, because you can't make it out of anything else. - You didn't know that, did you? - No, I didn't. There's another question I'd like to ask you. You say there's only bad to start with, and that the good must come from the bad. Who's to determine what's good and what's bad? You? Why not? How? Why, that's easy. Just make it up as you go along. Folks, there's a time to talk, and there's a time to act. I think the time to act is right now, and, with your support, I not only will win, but I will do all of the things I promised. I need your help. Oh, I need it badly, but I'm not gonna beg for it. In the name of this state, which we love... in the name of the governor in whose house we meet... I demand it. Well, what do you say, sir? You've got to say yes. With you in the race, we... I'm an old bird. I... But a game one. Look, I'll give you complete power as attorney general. You can do anything you see fit. I'll swing the ax to clear the way for you. Is that a deal? It's a deal. Jack, we have to get back to town... a lot to do. Dr. Stanton. Good night, Anne. Good night, Jack. Good night. I'm very glad to have met you. We want Willie! We want Willie! We want Willie! We want Willie! Willie! Willie! We want Willie! This is not a time for speech-making. I should get on my knees and ask God to give me strength to carry out your will. This much I swear to you. These things you shall have. I'm going to build a hospital... the biggest that money can buy... and it will belong to you, and any man, woman or child who is sick or in pain can go through those doors... and know that everything will be done for them that man can do... to heal sickness, to ease pain, free... not as a charity, but as a right. And it is your right. Do you hear me? It is your right! And it is your right that every child should have a complete education, that any man who produces anything can take it to market without paying toll, and no poor man's land or farm can be taxed or taken away from him. And it is the right of the people that they shall not be deprived of hope. Does he mean it, Jack? Does he? That's his bribe. What if it is his bribe? He swept the old gang out of office. What if they hollered like stuck pigs? He jammed through bill after bill, and the people got what they wanted. I demand that this bill be passed! Nobody's gonna tell me how to run this state. He started to build the roads, the schools, power dams... to change the face of the state from one end to the other. His methods? Politics is a dirty game, and he played it rough and dirty. Willie's little black book was a record of sin and corruption, and me, Jack Burden... I kept the book and added up the accounts. "Clown, show-off, playboy," they yelled at him, building football stadiums, fiercely proud of his son who played in them. He's gonna be an all-American. They said he was building up a private army, but he was building... always building. Always playing up to the crowd, letting them trample on tradition. Well, tradition needed trampling on. The crowds loved it and Willie loved it... and so did I. You lowdown, no-good redneck! What goes on here? That's what Sadie wants to know. The boss poses for too many pictures. I'll kill him. Why, Sadie, I'm surprised at you. I'll kill him. I hate all women! Was she pretty? Was she pretty? If I met her on the street, I'd never recognize her. Was she pretty? How should I know? I wasn't looking at her face. Look, if it's gonna cause all this grief, let him go. Let him go? I'll kill him. I'll drive him outta this state. Just because a guy's sitting with a couple of girls on his knees in public... Public or private, I know him. How about what happened in Chicago... that girl on skates? And the time you both went to St. Louis. There's a new invention, you know... photography and newsreels. Willie Stark in a nightclub. Willie Stark with a blonde. You could bleach your hair. I could also break every bone in his neck. After all I've done for him. Now he goes two-timing me. He's been two-timing Lucy, so there's another kind of arithmetic for what he's doing to you. Lucy? Lucy's a fool. If she had her way, he'd be back in Kanoma City slopping the hogs, and he knows it. He knows what she'd do for him. She had her chance. You seem to think Lucy's on her way out. He'll ditch her. Give him time. You oughta know. Oh... - Hey, you got the wrong guy. - I'm not the hero of this piece. All right, come on, both of you. Let's go. Hurry it up. Come on. Pillsbury put his hand in the pork barrel and got caught. I never did trust that guy. Later, boys, later. Say, Jack, go back and get the judge. Let's get him over to my hotel as soon as you can. I waited for you. Hello. You promised we could discuss my charity project... Children's Home? Oh, I'm very sorry. Something very important came up. You'll call me later, won't you? Yes, certainly. We're late. Look at you, Pillsbury... 50 years old, gut-sprung, teeth gone, never had a dime. If the Almighty had intended you to be rich, He'd have taken care of that a long time ago. The idea of you bein' rich... that's plain blasphemy. Ain't that a fact? Answer me! Yes. Louder, man! Don't mumble! Speak up! Say it's a fact, a blasphemous fact! It's a fact. It's a blasphemous fact! Yeah? Oh. I see. Dumond can't come. He says his wife is sick. I don't care if she's dyin'. Sugar, get the car. Get him and bring him over here. Now you know what you're supposed to do, don't you, Pillsbury? You're supposed to stay poor and take orders. Oh, there'll be some sweetening for you from time to time, but Duffy'll take care of that. Don't go settin' yourself up on your own again. Do you understand that? - Yes. - Louder, man, and say "I understand that." - I understand that! - Give him a pen and some paper, Sadie. See who that is, Duffy. Oh, hello, Judge. Sit down. I'll be with you in just a couple of seconds, huh? Now, write what I tell you to write. "Dear Governor Stark, "I wish to resign as auditor due to ill health, "to take effect as soon as you can relieve me. Respectfully yours." - Did you sign it? - No. Well, sign it! Don't put any date on it. I can fill that in when I need it. Now bring it to me. Here. Now get out. The papers have the story. Yeah, I know. They're talking about impeachment proceedings. Against who? This time, Pillsbury. I got that "this time," Judge. How true is it? It's too true. Yes? This is it, Willie. Jeff Hopkins on the wire. What have we got on Hopkins, Jack? Hello, Jeff. About that Pillsbury business... Here's what I want you to do when it comes up in the legislature. Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. You listen to me. You've got a mortgage comin' due on that place of yours in about five weeks, haven't you? You'd like to get it renewed, wouldn't you? All right. Tiny'll talk to you in the morning. Get going. You haven't answered my question. Why are you saving Pillsbury's hide? I'm not a bit interested in Pillsbury's hide. It's much more important than that. If the McMurphy boys can get away with this, there's no tellin' where they'll stop. Or where you will. Pillsbury is guilty. As attorney general of this state, it's my job to prosecute. Judge, you talk like Pillsbury was human. He isn't. He's a thing. You don't prosecute an adding machine if a spring goes bust and makes a mistake. You fix it. Well, I fixed him. I'm not a bit interested in Pillsbury. It's something much bigger than that. Yes, it is. He's right, Judge. Can't you see that he's right? He's right because you want him to be right. You're afraid to admit you made a mistake. Do it now before it's too late. I'm offering my resignation as attorney general. You'll have it in writing by messenger in the morning, dated. Took you a long time to make up your mind, Judge... a long time. What made you take such a long time? I wasn't sure. Now you are. I'll tell you what you are... you're scared. You sat in that easy chair of yours for 30 years and played at being a judge. Then I put a bat in your hand and said, "Go ahead, Judge, start swingin'," and you did, and you had a wonderful time, but now you're scared. You don't want to get your hands dirty. You want to pick up the marbles, but you don't want to get your hands dirty. Look at my whole program, Judge. How do you think I put that across? I knew how, but I never knew why. You're not by any chance thinkin' of goin' over to McMurphy's boys, are you? I'm through with politics. I'm happy to hear that. No hard feelings. Good-bye, Governor. You coming with me, Jack? You're making a mistake. You think he means it when he says he's through with politics, Sadie? No. No, I don't. What about you, Jack? I've known the judge all my life. He's always meant everything he said. All right, all right. Take it easy. I'll take your word for it. Sugar, take Miss Stanton home. When am I gonna see you again? What's the matter, Anne? Please take me home now, Sugar Boy. You've got to understand me. I understand you. It's myself I don't understand. Do you think I like sneakin' around corners any more than you do? But right now with the Pillsbury business and with your uncle quitting, if I get a divorce... Maybe we'd better stop seeing each other. No. No, we won't stop seeing each other, will we? No. Because you believe what I tell you. Because I believe what you tell me. Good evening, Governor Stark. I thought you might like to know that Judge Stanton kept his promise. He gave the story to every paper in town. Sugar, meet me at the hotel as soon as you can. These are serious charges... that Judge Stanton has given to the press. This legislature is entitled to a complete and full report on the Pillsbury affair. Let the truth be known! Let it come out! I vote we adjourn. I second the motion. - All those in favor, say "aye. - " Aye! Motion carried. Quiet! House is adjourned. You let Willie Stark get away with the Pillsbury graft, there's no telling... But we beat the Pillsbury rap. It's over. These things are never over. Tell you what I want you to do, Jack. I want you to start a new page in that black book of yours... under the name of Judge Stanton, huh? You're crazy. There's nothing on the judge. Why? Because his name is Stanton? Shh, shh, shh. Easy. What if I won't do it? You know, some of this has rubbed off on you. What are you gonna do? Have me shot? No, but I'll have to get myself a new boy. I tell you, there's nothing on the judge. Jack, there's something on everybody. Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption. It's a waste of time. What's the matter, Jack? You're afraid you might find something out? I kept saying to myself that Willie was wrong about the judge. If there was anything left at Burden's Landing, it was honor. I had to believe that. Anne, I want to ask you a question. Was the judge ever broke? Really broke? Why do you want to know? I don't want to know. But I've got to. Did he tell you... Did who tell me? I don't know. How should I know if the judge was ever broke? Hello. Come on, Anne. Take this food and start cooking. I'm hungry, Me, I'm on the thirsty side. Bring some glasses, Anne, quick. It's been a long time since I played this thing. What do you say we wake up the ghosts, huh? Another glass, Anne, for a ghost. Remember the last time I played this? You and Anne were dancing. Shall we dance? Let's-Let's have a drink first. No, no. Keep playing. Anne and I want to hear this, don't we, Anne? Adam, ghost... and me. What shall we drink to? To ghosts? To Adam. To the director of the new medical center. Don't you ever stop working for him? Adam. I came up here to get away. I'm sorry, Adam. Well, I'm not. What's wrong with being the director of the new medical center? Nothing, except that I'm not going to take it. Why? Because your uncle resigned? That's partly it. There are other things. - What other things? - You too? Yes, me too. Anne, if Adam doesn't want to discuss it, let's not. All right. Let's discuss it. But calmly. Calmly. Go ahead, Jack. Why do you think he wants me? Because you're the best man for the job. It could have nothing to do with my name being Stanton? - It could have. Let's grant that. - That's your answer. No, it's not. If that were the only answer, I wouldn't be with him anymore. There's another side of it. I learned something from him: You can't make an omelet without cracking eggs. Or heads. But at least a hospital will be built, and the sick will be cared for. - At what price? - At any price. Do you really believe that, Jack? I really believe that Stark wants to do good. You do too. It's a matter of method. Many times, out of evil comes good. Pain is evil. As a doctor, you should know that. Pain is an evil. It is not evil. It is not evil in itself. Stark is evil. People of this state don't think so. How would they know? The first thing Stark did was to take over the newspapers and the radio stations. Why be so afraid of criticism? If Stark is interested in doing good, he should also be interested in the truth. I don't see how you can separate the two. No, Stark is not for me. No, Stark is not for you. Well, what's for you? Pride. Pride, that's all it is. Foolish, stupid pride. All you've ever talked about is what you could do... if somebody would tear down and build. All right. Somebody has, and he's given it to you. But he's not for you. No, he's not for you. Anne. Anne! Will I find anything, Judge? Will I? I didn't find it all at once. It takes a long time to go through old courthouse records and musty deeds. A very long time. But it wasn't too hard for me. I was well trained in research, especially this kind. I found what I didn't want to find. Have some photostat copies made of these. Yes, sir. I'll be back tomorrow for them. Who is it? It's me... Sadie Burke. Wait a minute. All right. Come in. Whew! Awful lot of smoke. Awful lot of whiskey. You sober? Stone. I'll have one with you. What are you hiding out for? I'm not. I've been sleeping. For four days? You've been back in town for four days. Willie knows everything. Willie's worried about his boy. Willie's boy is worried about Willie's boy. Why don't you put something on the phonograph... a lowdown, mean blues? Play it over and over again until you crack it and get sick of it and go back to work. I do it all the time. That's not my problem. No, it isn't your problem. I'll wait for you if you want to powder your nose. I'll be with you in a minute. Hmm. Yeah, I can see it. I got to look in the mirror to be able to see it. Soft, white skin. Not like mine. I had smallpox when I was a kid. Where I lived, it seemed nearly all the kids had smallpox. It leaves your face hard. She's got poise. Look at the way she holds her head at just the right angle. That takes training. That takes years of training. I see what Willie sees. Willie's got big ideas, Jack. What do you mean? A girl like that could be a governor's wife or even a president's. What are you talking about? He ditched Lucy, he ditched me and he'll ditch you. Answer me! He'll ditch everybody, because that's what Willie wants. Nobody in the world but him. What are you talking about? You and your high-toned friends. What do they know? What do they know about anything? Why did you have to mix her in? You're crazy, Sadie. You're out of your mind. Am I? Why don't you go down and ask her. Or ask him. Ask Willie. Go ahead. Ask him, ask him. Shut up! Shut up! Ow-w-w! Oh-ho-ho-ho. Well. Nice catch. All right, all the ends over here. All the ends over this way. Come on. He's off today. It's only practice. He'll be all right tomorrow. You've been gone a long time, Jack. Yeah, I figured if you needed me, you'd yell. Why'd you lay around that hotel? Thinkin'. About what? Things. What did you find on the judge? Nothing. You're sure you didn't find anything on the judge? Yeah, I'm sure. You're going to keep trying, aren't you? If you want me to. I want you to. Something else I want you to do too. What? Bucket boy? Towel-swinger? What? What's eating you, Jack? What else do you want me to do? If you've got something on your mind, spit it out. We've been together too long to play games. What do you want me to do? I hear your pal, Adam Stanton, turned down the job as director of the hospital. That's bad, especially at a time like this. Oh? How did you hear? Why? What difference does it make? I just wanted to know. I heard it around. How did you hear he turned it down? Be right back, Jack. I want to see what's happening here. You're going to practice the way I tell you. I'm gonna do it the way I want to do it. Tom, come here. What's going on here? I don't care if he is your son, Governor. No special rules for him. Doesn't make any difference to me whether I play or not. It does to me. What do you want him to do? To behave himself like the rest of the boys. Four times this season, he's broken training. He was on the practice field half-potted. Tom, you're going to have to obey the rules. Do you hear me? I put 'em across, don't I? Every Saturday, I put 'em across. I can still do it drunk or sober. That's all you want, isn't it? For me to put 'em across so you can big-shot it around? Isn't that all you want? Tom. He's a little high-strung. Tom, come here! Tom! Come on, Tommy. Let's go faster. Come on! It's the governor's son. Willie, Mr. Hale's here to see you. Go on upstairs, Lucy. I have some business I want to talk over with Mr. Hale. What I've got to say, anybody can listen to. Where is your boy? Now, now, don't get excited. Get me another drink, Sugar. My daughter may die. She's not gonna die. She'll get the best medical attention there is. No expense is gonna be spared. Where is your boy? I'll get him. Wait a minute, Lucy. He's asleep, and the doctor said after a good night's sleep, he'll be all right. No. He won't be all right unless you make him all right. I'll get him. Lucy! Care for a drink? No, thanks. Accidents will happen, you know. "Accidents"? Your boy was drunk. I saw the police report. There was nothing about drunkenness on the police report. Whose police and whose report? I say the boy was drunk, and I know it. Right here before your father, I want you... Mr. Hale. Tom, the doctor says you need rest, boy. I don't want you to try to cover up for me. I was wrong. That's all there is to it. You don't know what you're talking about. I saw the police report. I don't care what the police report says. I was driving, and I was drunk. It's all my fault. Anything you want to do to me, you can do. Whatever you want me to do, I'll do. Nobody has to do anything. Stop worrying. I'll take care of everything. I don't want you to take care of anything. Tom, go on upstairs and get some rest, boy. Go on. Go on. Go on. Sugar, help him. Mr. Hale. Come on over and sit down. Sure you wouldn't care for a drink, Mr. Hale? Hey, Tiny. Go home, will ya? Go on. Out of here. Go on. What business did you say you were in? I didn't say. What business are you in? Trucking business. Trucking business. Trucks run on state roads. If a man in the trucking business had a contract with the state... a big one, that'd be pretty good, wouldn't it? Go, on, Jack, tell him what would happen. Go on, tell him. You're trying to bribe me, aren't you? No, no. I'm not trying to bribe you. I'm only talking things over with you, that's all. You're pretty good at talking. I remember when you first started talking. A place called Upton. You did a lot of talking then, and the things you said made sense... to me and a lot of other people. I believed in you, I followed you, and I fought for you. Well, the words are still good. But you're not. And I don't believe you ever were. Sugar, follow him. Keep calling in. Lucy! I'd like Anne to see you now. I'd like Anne to see you now, you drunken sot! Come on! All right, all right, gentlemen. I'll give you a statement. This whole thing is a mess of lies. It's a frame. The man that made that statement... Have him repeat it to my face. You can't. He's vanished. Let me ask you some questions. Why has he gone? Where is he? Maybe you could answer those questions too, Governor. Look... I won't dignify that question with an answer. One more question, Governor. Where's your son? At the football stadium, where he's supposed to be. He's going to play for State University, which this administration is responsible for. He's not hiding from anybody, gentlemen. He'll be out there in full view of 70,000 fans, one of which will be me. See you, men. Where's Stark? How 'bout Tommy Stark? Hey, Willie, send your boy in! Why don't they put him in? Come on, Willie! Send your boy in! What's the matter, Willie? Is your little boy ashamed to show his face? Get this man out of here! Go on, get him out of here. What's the idea? They're booing you. Ever since the accident, my head... The doctor said it was nothing. Get dizzy, can't see... You were scared, plain scared. Get out of here. They're booing me too. Me, Willie Stark. I built the stadium for those dirty... Get out of here! That-a-boy. Get mad. Show some spirit. Jack, tell him what his playing means. Go on, tell him. You can never tell about a head injury. Maybe the boy's hurt. He's hurt? I'm hurt. It wasn't me that wrapped the car around the tree. It wasn't me that got drunk. But me, I'm taking the rap. Go on, kid. Get out there and play. Show 'em the kind of stuff a Stark is made of. I wouldn't know. Cut it out. All right. I'll play. Now, get out of here! Stark's going in. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. Tommy! Tommy! Boss, you got-gotta eat. You g-gotta. I'm the one that made him play. I sent him in. Sit down, Willie. Please sit down. I sent him in. What difference does that make now? What goes on? There isn't a plane flying. They've got to fly. This is my son. He's got to live. I just got a call from Dr. Burnham. The earliest he can possibly get here will be tomorrow morning. Isn't there anybody else we can get? I still think Dr. Stanton should operate. That's up to Governor Stark. He wanted another doctor, a specialist. I sent for one. How bad is it really, Doc? He's unconscious and paralyzed. Has he got a chance? To live, yes. What do you mean? Even if the operation is successful... that is, if he lives... I think he'll be paralyzed for life. You'll do everything you can, won't you? Anything between you and me, that won't count, would it? It doesn't have to. Look, Doc, anything you want in the world, you just ask for it, and you got it. Go on, Doc. Ask for it. There are some things, Governor Stark, that even you can't buy. Do you want me to operate or don't you? Yes. I want you to operate. Please, may I see Tom now? Yes. How much does the doc know? About what? Oh, you know what I'm talking about. How much does he know? About what? About Anne and me. He doesn't know a thing. Not a thing. Jack, how is he? The boy? Yes. He'll live. Oh, thank God. How is... Willie? He blames himself, doesn't he? He'll find someone else to blame in a few days. I tried to call here at the hospital, but I just... Anne. Anne, why did you do it? He wasn't like anybody I ever knew before. You mean, he wasn't like me. He wasn't like anybody I ever knew before. I love him, I guess. I guess that's the reason. Everybody loves him. He wants to marry me. Are you going to? Not now. It would hurt him. A divorce would hurt his career. "His career." Jack. Jack, what are you going to do? You can't leave him now. He needs you now more than he ever did before. What Willie needs, Willie's got. You don't know him. You've known him all these years, and you don't really know him at all. What about Adam? Adam? Well, you don't have to worry about him. If Adam finds out, it'll be easy to prove that Stanton is no different than anyone else. Just show him these. Willie was right. Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption. Even Judge Stanton. Show them to him, Anne. Change the picture of the world that Adam has in his head. Just like our picture of it has been changed. Wipe out everything he's ever believed in. It'll be good for him. There's no god but Willie Stark. I'm his prophet, and you're his... Oh, Anne. Anne, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... Anne. What's going on here? It's all right, Officer. We both work for Willie Stark. Right over there. That's going to be the main building. Fifteen stories, like the model. Over there, the laboratory. Finest technical equipment in the world. What are you trying to convince me of? I've taken the job. Why? My reasons are my own. Why are you building the hospital? To do some good for the people of the state. And get some votes. Oh, there's lots of ways to get votes. Yes, I know. I won't stand for any interference. I won't interfere. I may fire you, but I won't interfere. If that's a threat, you're wasting your time. You know what I think of your administration. Yes, I know. I'll tell you what. You stay on your side of the fence; I'll stay on mine. Is that a deal? Now he had us all... me, Anne and Adam. Now we all worked for him. And so the eyes of the entire nation are now focused... upon Governor Willie Stark, an amazing phenomenon on the American political scene. The whole state is filled with his accomplishments, each one of them, of course, bearing his personal signature... to make sure that no one will ever forget who gave them to the state. This is the way the roads used to be. But there are those who claim that they were adequate for the people's needs, that you don't need a four- or six-lane highway for a horse and buggy. When Stark boasts of his great school system, his critics say, "You can't go to school and work in the fields at the same time." And they question the benefit of these projects, charging that the need and the poverty of the people is as great as before. Willie Stark has never forgotten the source of his power... the people who supported him. He still keeps his touch with these people of the back woods, making periodic trips to such places as Kanoma City, now famous as his birthplace. For those who say that Willie Stark is a man of destiny, there are others who claim that he is a man of evil, a man who cares neither for the people or the state, but only for his own personal power and ambition. Obviously, these ambitions go far beyond the boundaries of the state. Just how far? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, he is here. And from the looks of things, he is here to stay. Willie Stark... messiah or dictator? How do you like it, Governor? How many theaters will this play in? All over the country. Hear that, Jack? All over the country. Oh, there's one thing in there I didn't like too well... that "messiah or dictator." That's our point of view, Governor. That's the way it stands. All right. All right. That's the way it stands, as of now. Hello, Lucy. How you makin' it, Pa? How are you, Tom? I've made some refreshments for your friends. I'll get them. I'll help. Thank you. Thank you kindly. If you don't mind, Mrs. Stark, the boys have to get back to make the morning editions. Set 'em up on the porch, fellas. We'll take some pictures out here first. Mrs. Stark, please. All right, fellows. Take one down there. Shoot it up this way. You're still a great cook, Lucy. Great cook. Well, I guess I better be getting back to town. Nice to have spent the day with the family. Bye, Lucy, Tom. Bye. Take care of yourself, Pappy. Oh, uh, how do you like the new radio I got you? You know how it works? You can get police calls on it. Come here. I'll show you. This one for police calls, up here. Car 62, proceed to 518 Oak Street. Tom Jones is beating his wife again. Car 62, Car 62... Now this one. It's all right. Go ahead, go ahead. We interrupt this program to bring you a special announcement. This afternoon, the body of Richard Hale, father of the girl who died in the automobile accident... involving the governor's son, was found. A medical examination revealed that he was beaten to death. The ugly charge of official murder... had been hurled at the administration by a coalition of Stark's opponents... led by Judge Stanton, lately an outspoken critic of the administration. - Your friend, the judge. - Thus, an almost forgotten incident... provided the spark that might set off the explosion... needed to rock Willie Stark out of power. The latest report is that impeachment proceedings may be instituted... How long will it take you to pack? I want you to go back to Capital City with me tonight. Why? Because I need you. What for? I'll explain all that later. Lucy, do like I say. I'll wait outside. Stay right here. Bear witness to what I've got to say. - She can bear witness too. - I'm going back to the capital and get hold of Duffy. You stay right here, Sadie. Somebody's got to go back to the capital. I'll go in the other car. Then tell Duffy not to do anything or say anything till I get there. - Yes, Governor. - Now that he's in trouble, he needs us... so he can lead us around like monkeys with rings in our nose. So he can say to people, "Look at me. Feel sorry for me. Just a family man... with a wife and a crippled son." Shut up! Willie! - Why don't you leave us alone. - Leave him alone? How many scrapes have I gotten him out of? How many girls... Willie, stop. It's not him they're after. It's me. How many half-witted apes do you think I'm gonna have to pay to square this one? What do you think this is gonna cost me? What do you think it cost him? A man builds for his son. That's all he builds for. Willie. Tom. Tom! Give me a drink, Jack. She'll go. No good, Willie. I offer a house resolution. Whereas Willie Stark, governor of this state, has been guilty of incompetence, corruption, and favoritism in office... yes, and other high crimes... and he is hereby impeached... and ordered to be tried by the senate. - What's the score? - - They're lined up against you solid. They had a meeting. How do you know? Were you there? Me? What would I be doing there? Selling me out. How many votes have we got? Eleven. We need 20. We might be able to dig up a few more. Yeah? Do you know how? No. Do you? Jack, come here. What do you got in your black book about that old friend of yours? What do you mean? You know who. Your friend, the judge. If and when you need it. If and when... Right now! He's got four senators wrapped up in his hip pocket. Come on, boy. What do you got? I'm gonna give him a break. If he can prove it isn't true, I won't spill it. I oughta bust you, Jack. I promised two people I'd do it this way. Who are they? Myself... and someone else. It doesn't matter who. I'm gonna give him a break. All right. But if you got the facts, you got the facts. The truth is sufficient, just like it says in the Bible. That's the way it's going to be. All right, boy. I trust you. Where are you going? I'll be around. Who else do you think he promised, Willie? You be smart. Play square with him. You're gonna need people like us around. Are you sure? The chips were down, and Willie knew it. He was fighting for his life. He roared across the state, making speech after speech, and all of them adding up to the same thing... "It's not me they're after; it's you." Willie hollered "foul." Willie knew if you hollered long enough, hard enough and loud enough, people begin to believe you. Just in case they didn't, he organized spontaneous demonstrations. Tell the boys to get the hicks out. Bring 'em in from the sticks. Empty the pool halls. Turn 'em out. Turn the yokels out. In case anyone argued back, he organized spontaneous slugging. Willie pulled every trick he ever knew... and added a few more. Hey, Sugar. You'll never live to be impeached. Boy, I'll live to be president. Step on it. I've got 14 senators to vote against this impeachment. If I win, you're out of politics. I'll do whatever the judge says. And always the trail led to one place... to Burden's Landing and the judge. You sure you don't want me to go in with you? I'm sure. Hurry it up, boy. We got places to go. Judge, I beg you, as a favor to yourself, to me, call up, release your votes. I made a mistake once, Jack... when I resigned. It was too easy then, just resigning and pulling out. No, Jack, I've made my choice. I have nothing more to lose. Judge, you know what Stark is capable of. Think it over. I'll leave now. I'll come back tomorrow. We'll talk about it then. You can give me your answer then. I can't wait until tomorrow. I'm a very impatient man. I told you not to come in here. Is it true, Judge, that you're behind the impeachment proceedings? Yes, it's true. I wanted to hear you say it with your own silver tongue. Well, you've heard it. If that's all you came to hear, you could've saved a trip. Mind if I pour myself a drink? How about you, Judge? Will you have one? You better. You're gonna need it. What did he say, Jack? You'll get your answer tomorrow. Are you kidding? Did you show it to him or didn't you? Show me what? That's what I figured. Let's get down to cases, Judge. You remember a man with the name of Littlepaugh? How did you find out? Do you remember a man by the name of Littlepaugh? Remember the Fortune Electric Company? Of course. I was their counsel for over ten years. Remember how you got the job? How did you find out? Do you remember how you got the job? You know, Judge, dirt's a funny thing. Some of it rubs off on everybody. How did you get the job, Judge? Blackmail? I swear I never even remembered his name. Isn't that remarkable, Jack? I never even remembered his name. It's all so long ago, it's hard for me to realize it ever happened. Yeah, but it did. Yes, it did. But it's difficult for me to realize it. For me too, Judge. Thanks for that much. Well, I guess you know what the next move is, don't you? Yes, I do. Jack Burden, Willie Stark's hatchet man. I asked you, how did you find out? This would never stand at law... not for a minute. It happened over 25 years ago. And you could never get any testimony. Everybody is dead. Everybody except you, Judge. You're alive. And people think you're a certain kind of man. And you just couldn't bear for people to think otherwise. But ever since then, I... I've done my duty. I... am responsible for many good things. But I also did this. Yes, yes, you did. Judge, I beg of you. Call and release your votes, for your sake. You have tender sensibilities for a hatchet man. Good night, gentlemen. How about my answer? You'll have it in the morning. I want it tonight. In the morning. Good night, gentlemen. How did you find out? We got a lot to do. It's getting late, Jack. Let's get back to town. You know we're through, don't you? You don't mean that. What are you doing here? It's all right. Just here to discuss politics with the judge. Oh, I see. Well, good night. Good night. Did you give him... Wait a minute, Jack. - Answer me. - Did you give... Aren't you going back with him? No. Why not? You belong with him. Jack, how could you have done it? When Anne brought me those papers, she told me you promised not to tell Stark until... I know. And I kept my promise. Anne. Anne. Anne! From all over the state, they're streaming in. From the hill country and farms, the lumber camps, by boat, by train, by horse and on foot, Willie Stark's army. The state capitol is filled with rumors, one of which that Stark is planning to seize power by force. As commander of the state militia, he has... Come in. The door's open. Jack... What do you want? No, I want to see you cry. Stop it! I called you all afternoon. I've been calling... I know. I was here. You've got to tell Adam. You've got to see him. Tell him what? He knows about me. About you and Willie? I tried to explain to him. I tried to explain to him that it wasn't the way he thought is was. How was it, Anne? You tell me. He hit me, Jack. My own brother. He hit me. Your brother's an old-fashioned man. He believes in a sister's honor. Me, I'm a modern man. The 20th-century type. I run. I'm frightened, Jack. For who... your brother or Willie? We're through. Who's through with who? He called me this afternoon. He's going back to Lucy. He said it was better this way. Better for who... him? Both of us. Did he tell you that, too, when he asked you to betray the judge? - At least I walked out on him. - Oh, Jack. Help me, please, please. Adam's all I got left now. Oh, Jack, if you ever loved me... If I ever loved you? I'll go find Adam. Where do you think you're going? Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you. Do you know who Dr. Stanton is? Yes, sir. Did he try to come though here today? Haven't seen him, sir. Can you check the other entrances? There are no other entrances today. Other entrances are blocked off. Orders are to take no chances. If you care to come inside and wait, Mr. Burden, we can find you a seat. No, thanks. I'll wait out here. If Dr. Stanton shows up, let me know. Pass the word along to the boys, will you? Yes, sir. All right, now. Everybody. That means everybody. Let's let Willie know we're here. All together. - Willie! Willie! - We want Willie! Willie! Willie! We want Willie! We will first proceed to take the judgment of the senate... on the question of the impeachment of the governor. Mr. Speaker, this is a farce... to ask us to vote... in the face of the kind of intimidation... and pressure that has been exerted here in the past few weeks. Even that crowd outside... yelling on cue... is part of that pressure. Willie! Willie! We want Willie! Attention, please. Attention, please. This is a special announcement from Willie Stark to you people out there. He doesn't want any one of you to leave. He wants you to stay in front of this state capitol until the fight is over. If you want Willie Stark to win, stay where you are, do you hear me? Stay where you are. Don't go away. Stay where you are. Don't go away. Attention, please. The balloting on the impeachment proceedings... against Governor Stark... has just ended. This is the result. Willie Stark... has won! They tried to ruin me, but they are ruined. They tried to ruin me because they did not like what I have done. Do you like what I have done? Remember, it's not I who have won, but you. Your will is my strength, and your need is my justice. And I shall live in your right and your will. And if any man tries to stop me from fulfilling that right and that will, I'll break him... I'll break him with my bare hands, for I have the strength of many. Jack, boy, I knew we'd win out. Come on. Doctor, I'm very glad to... Does it... hurt much, boss? Does it hurt much? Anne. Anne, where are you going? I don't know. Leave me alone. To do what? I don't care. No, that's too easy. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. I do. Leave me alone, please. No, no more. He's dead. We're alive. My brother's dead. We've got to go on living. How? So Adam's death has meaning. So that it wasn't wasted. Anne, our life has to give his death meaning. Don't you see that? Look at those people. Look at them. They still believe. And we've got to make them see Willie the way Adam always saw him, or there's no meaning in anything, anything. Mr. Burden, the governor's asking for you. You better hurry. He's going fast. Will you wait here? Could have been... whole world, Willie Stark. Whole world, Willie Stark. Why did he do it to me, Willie Stark? Why?
