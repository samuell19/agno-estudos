Wait! Mr. Minowada's Class Tokui! Stop slacking off! There's a spider. It smells bad. You are "Bad", get cleaning. - Yamato, bring me a dustpan. - Yes, sir. - Sir, I've brought a bucket of water! - OK! - Now, mop the floor! - Yes, sir! Sir! -Tokui! - Yes. - I'm going home, good bye. - See you tomorrow. - I'm going home, good bye. - Good bye. - Sir, we've finished cleaning. - OK! - I'll check later, you can go home. - Thank you! Mr. Chiba, who drew it? You know Hideo Hase. He's the son of my next-door neighbor. He's a bit strange. You gave his sketch a "C"? It's really bad. It seems he wanted to paint a train. I understand. But it's really unique. It's only eccentric. It's not interesting. But... The National school isn't for artists. But, I don't think it's a good painting. I understand what you say. But I think we should appreciate a promising student. - Do you think he has talent? - Yes, I think so. First, his idea to paint from above isn't normal. So, he captured the train scientifically. In other words, he painted the train in action. Do you think so? Anyway. If you are interested in him, and he is your neighbor, can you take care sometimes take him under your wing? I'll do it if you don't mind. I'm worried about him, because he always paints eccentrically like this. -"ROKKO"- "THE START OF A TRAIL UP ROKKO MOUNTAIN" Mr. Minowada! Miss Katayama. Are you coming back now? - You, too? - Yes. - Good-bye. - OK. Good-bye. - Please say hello to Susum! - Yes. Thank you so much. - Welcome home. - Hi. Sir! Welcome home! Can I help you? - No, thank you. - Really? - Pay attention well, OK? - Yes. I'm back! Welcome home. Sir, you have a letter from your mother. OK, thank you. "To: RYOTA MINOWADA" "You are old enough to get married." "Please just make me feel secure." - 16th, at 3pm. - Excuse me. Have you brought my dinner already? - I'm sorry, but I need to go to Kobe. - OK. Sir, a neighborhood meeting will be held tonight at 7pm. I'll attend in your place. I'll attend the meeting tonight. I want to see Yasuko. No, don't go. Don't you think so? You can attend if you want, you've only gone sometimes. Please take some hot water. Hideo, you are really quiet tonight. - Hideo will be in fifth grade this spring. - Yes. Thank you. What do you think? - I think it's OK. - Yes. Wouldn't you like another cup of tea? - Yasuko, they gave us a bar of soap. - Oh really? Thank you. Then, about this year. We need to prepare savings and an air-raid shelter. Mr. Minowada! Do you have something to say? - No, I don't. - OK, thank you. Everyone, thank you for coming. Good job. Thank you. Why don't you talk more with us? You and Mr. Minowada, you aren't in a hurry? - You'd better do so. - Then we will, thank you. Don't talk until too late, please. OK. - Can you help me? - Yes. - Thank you. Hideo, let's go home. I want to talk with them. The children shouldn't go out at night. You haven't finished your homework. Be careful when walking outside at night. - Good bye. - Good bye. We'll leave now, good bye. I can't drink sake, thank you. Excuse me, Mr. Minowada. Could I talk to you? How can I help? To tell the truth, I'd like to talk about Hideo. I scold him a lot. But he doesn't study at all. Really? But... You may make him nervous if you keep scolding him. But I'm sleepless with worry. Don't worry, he is really obedient. Today I saw his painting, it was really nice. You have obligations to him to grow up free from all cares. Thank you for your advice. After all, he is my only son. First you must take care of his health, and he'll be a man who is big-hearted and strong-spirited for this country in the future. I understand. - I'll support you as much as possible. - Thank you. - Please look after my son. - Not at all. She's a really nice mother. I think so. She is thinking only about her son. Mr. Minowada! Come here! Yes. - Mr. Masaki? - Hi. - You are surprised, aren't you? - Yes. - Welcome. - Thank you. Oh, it's you, Mr. Masaki! - I thought a ghost had come! - A ghost! - Is he home? - Yes, he is. - It's difficult. - Father, you have a visitor. - Who is? - Mr. Masaki. Mr. Masaki? Sir! It's been a while. Welcome, please come in. I'm happy you are in good health. Thank you. I'm surprised you came so suddenly. - You have visitors. - They are my close friends. What's the matter? To tell the truth, my father had a cerebral hemorrhage. So, I've come back. Oh, I see. That's too bad. How is he? The doctor said he's all right. I'm glad to hear that. This is my student, Nobuo Masaki. He is working in a library and doing research in ancient Manchu. They're from the Neighborhood Association, Susumu Katayama and Mr. Minowada, a teacher. I'm Ryota Minowada, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Make yourself comfortable. Mr. Masaki. Mr. Minowada graduated from Kei University in Kyoto too. He is working at a national school. You are an odd fellow. - He likes children. - I'm not sure about that. I said to prepare three cups. Miss, you are happy, aren't you? - Because Mr. Masaki has come back. - What are you saying! Hey, Yasuko! Yes! Mr. Minowada and Mr. Katayama said they would leave. But we're making English tea for them. It's OK. The bamboo is growing well. Father. Mr. Masaki. Yasuko, has brought a souvenir for you. Thank you. It's a small gift. Can I see it? Yes. - Can I? - Of course. Excellent! What do you think? - Is that OK? - Yes. - And about you, Mr Minowada. - Yes. Some people complain that your educational principles are rough. My educational principles? Who complained? - The parents of my students? - No. I can't say who said. I heard you went out with your students and allowed them to climb trees. Yes, I did. They were very happy. - Then, it's true. - Yes. To subdue nature is an instinct, for example, to long for high places. I think it's a good idea to encourage tree climbing, to stimulate their active impulse. But if someone falls and is hurt? Who takes responsibility? Don't worry. First, the teacher explains, and later they climb. But, it's a little rough. Now... Mr. Furui said my educational principles are rough. I'm thinking about how to treat the students. Not only to develop their strong points, but also to develop indomitable spirit. And to help them to grow up lively. In other words, even if it's snowing heavily or there is a strong wind, the children don't give up. I want the children to train their minds and bodies. Therefore, my way looks rough. Wait a moment, please. I prepare enough before the activity, so I'm convinced of my way. "Lively" and "Rough", are similar, but not the same. I totally agree with Mr. Minowada. Now, the national schools have obligations to our education. We need to coach the students... to be excellent Japanese for the Emperor. Therefore... Please tell him to wait. But, sir... He said how rude. - Do you have a visitor? - Yes, Mr. Tokui has come. - Mr. Tokui? - Yes. - Then you can go see him. - Can I? Then, I'll go. Now, the duty of the national schools is to educate good and tough students. To prepare them for the future... Thank you for waiting. Please have a seat. Well, what can I do for you? - OK, I'll tell you. - Go ahead. I want to ask you a question. I went on a business trip. And I've come back. Then I saw Kinnosuke's school report. His grade for ethical training is worse. Is something wrong? Shouldn't it be an A? Is that right? No, it's not wrong. Then you put a B on purpose? No, because I think it's a B. I was thinking of putting a C. A "C"? You said a C? What a dirty trick! Please be careful what you say. What makes you think you can talk like that? You are so rude. My son is a form leader from the first year. But, you don't approve of him. Do you know who I am? I'm a powerful person. You don't know that? - If I complain about you, I can sack you. - You shouldn't say that. - No one listens your old-fashioned threats now. - What? What? Do you want to know why I put a B? Your son did well in academic subjects but he has a weak sense of morals. - What are you saying? - For example, he wrote contemptuously in a composition about the children from a poor family. And he criticized his friend's family. He tends to be ill-natured. So he is disliked by everybody. - Poor child! - You said poor? In short, the problem is his family's home training. His parents need to reflect first. You fool! What are you saying? I'll talk to the headmaster. Who do you think you are? I'll have you sacked! Come with me! What are you doing? Hey, Churchill! I'm Churchill? You look just like Churchill, and your way is also just like him! - How dare you say such a thing? - Because of my great contempt for you. - I did it on behalf of all of teachers. - What! Headmaster! Vice-principal! Come here! Someone come here, anyone! Hey, is anyone there? Welcome home! He won again! What? - Idiot! Stop loafing! Finish your work without listening to sumo! What nonsense! Welcome home. Are you OK? This room is dark. Turn on the light! Yes. Papa! What? You went to my school, right? What's the problem? - If you went, I won't forgive you! - Kin! You went to my school, right? Why can't I go there? He told lies about my family! But, I'm a bad boy. It's not my teacher's fault. He's a very good teacher! Is he a good teacher? He's an honest man. If you shout at him, it would be shameful for me. How can I face him? Your father didn't go to school! Mr. Minowada, are you there? Susumu! Come in! How are you? Are you working now? I'm writing a letter. Excuse me! Please don't bother about me. -You did something at school today, right? - About Churchill? Everyone is talking about you. You felt refreshed, right? I heard Churchill scream. It's a great pleasure for us, he's unpopular with the neighborhood. - Sir, you have a visitor. - Who? Mr. Tokui. He's come. He may come for revenge. Good evening, sir. I'm very sorry I've come so late. Don't worry about it - Can I help you? - Yes. To tell the truth... I've come to ask a favor of you. Now, look... To tell the truth, sir.... Anyway, I've sorted it for the time being. Could you keep a secret from my son that I went to school? Could you? I know this is asking too much, but... Of course. Even if you didn't ask me, I wouldn't have told him about it. Are you sure? Don't worry about it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your support. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Please keep it a secret. Goodbye. He is a nice father, isn't he? I shouldn't have hit him? I'm back. Where were you? I was talking with Mr. Minowada. He's on night duty tonight. - Do we have some sweets? - No, we've had no delivery today. Let's have some English tea. - What were you talking about? - About many things. About you, too. Oh, about me? What did he say? He asked me if you wouldn't marry. Why did he ask you? I heard you said that you wouldn't marry because of your job. He asked me if you were sure not to marry, so I told him. What did you say? I said you endured because of pride. Then, Mr. Minowada said he thought so. - How rude! - And he said another thing. "A healthy and beautiful woman, like your sister." You can be proud! He really said it like this. "It's unnatural that a woman like you wants to stay single." - He looks down on me! - And he also said... "Your sister is hard for me to deal with. "When she says something, I feel she scolds me." - He is afraid of you. - Oh... And he praised Yasuko of the Yukawa family. How? He said she was an angel. She is hard to approach for an ordinary man like us. Oh, he praised her greatly. Hey. Do the best you can before it's too late. Before it's too late, OK? What are you saying? Please don't say such odd things. You don't know what it's about? I'll go to bed. CHAPTER "CHIYO" Hey, Yasuko, please look! - You may fall! - I'm OK! Are you taking a walk? - Let's go to the hill! - Nice idea. Have you heard? About Mr. Minowada's quarrel. A quarrel? Is it true? Yes, he's so strong, and he hit a man. If he gets married, he may hit his wife. But, if he hit someone, he had a very serious reason. Anyway, if he hit someone, he is a barbarian. - Let's take a rest! - OK. Yasuko. If you love someone, what would you do? What would I do? I don't know yet. You've never thought about it? No, never. Oh, really? But, if you meet someone nice someday, can you say how you'd behave? You mean you will keep your love for him to yourself? Or, would you face him fair and square? I don't know. But if you really love him, you want to win his heart, right? I think so. But, I can't do it. I don't think I ever could. Oh, you seem to be so timid. I'll face him fair and square. If he is a brave man. Heave-ho! Heave-ho! He looks like the king of an island. Let's leave him. ..., 78 sen, 84 sen, 97 sen, 43 sen, 26 sen, 81 sen. And 56 sen. - I have an answer! - Koyama. - 579 sen. - Sir! - Ookuma. - 569 sen. - Is it correct? Komori. - 5 yen 79 sen. - Good! - Who can get the answer of 5 yen 79 sen. - I did! Good! Next! 78 sen, 97 sen.. "Training of a nation" "Elementary school" has been changed to "National school". It's not only a change of name. For the opportunity like this holy war, to educate the Japanese people for the future, it's necessary to develop a nation. Paying special attention to this aim, I hope the parents our students cooperate with us. Now, about my educational principles, I would like to ask your opinion and to be asked questions. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes. You are very good to your students, so I'm pleased with it. But, you are spoiling them too much, aren't you? - Spoiling them too much? - I suppose so. Do you think so? When I should scold them, I scold a lot, I think. But, when you are teaching them, you seem to play with them. But, I never teach them jokingly. If you've received a bad impression, it's my fault. I'll be more careful. I'm easygoing. So I don't care about small things. So, I suppose I behave naturally like that in class. - Please understand that. - Sir. But, if we just cooperate with the children for anything and everything like you, we can't educate our children. You are quite right. However, in this world, some people think just to say "Behave yourself!" or "Be a good boy!" over and over is to discipline the children. On the contrary I think children cower this way. My "disciplining the children" is, to educate them to endure a hard time and to take part in any unforeseen events in the future. As an excellent Japanese, they can work as an expert. To build up such a mind and body. But, if they go astray from the right way of life, we need to admonish them. I understand your new educational principles are not from teachers; college. You are talking as a university graduate, aren't you? Absolutely not. Let me be clear, it makes little difference between "a university graduate" and "a teacher training graduate". The only difference is New or Old methods of teaching. In other words, "Right education" or "Stiff and formal education". But, people say you are "unusual", "extreme", heretical", and "a greenhorn", etc. - Do you know that? - What a stupid question! Why don't you stop asking such silly questions? Stop it! Madam. Mr. Minowada is just who he is. As you know, once he has a thought, he will never change his way. He is an honest man. He is a really good teacher for my son. Let's leave everything to him! If someone wants to complaint about him, please tell me. - I'll listen to you. - Sir. You have only one thing I don't like. I would like to stop your bad habit. You are doing it now. You put your hands in your trouser pockets. No one is slovenly in the army. I have no excuse. I'll be more careful from now on. You did it again! Mr.Tokui! Are you calling me? I'm sorry about the other day. The other day? Oh, about Churchill! I thought you were really ruthless. You are too energetic! You are young, but you are admirable. - I can never compete with you. - Don't tease me, please. It's I who think better of you. I retract "Churchill"! Really? I'm not "Churchill"? I'm sorry for that. Thank you! - Sir, who do I look like today? - Well, let me see. - I suppose Dharma. - Dharma? I look like Dharma. Then I can't do anything! - Are you OK? - It can't be helped, considering my age. - Recently I've been in poor health. - I'm sorry to hear that. Not only can I not see well, but I have a headache or a buzzing in my ears. - Or I feel dull... - How long have you had symptoms? - It's not your fault. - Really? I feel relieved. - It was 6 months ago it first occurred. - Oh. - I'll introduce you to a good doctor in Osaka. - I'll go anywhere you tell to me. - The doctor is a woman. - Thank you. - Everything is just perfect. - Wait a moment, please. Thank you. "From Ryota Minowada To Chiyo Katayama" - Have you had inflammation of the kidneys? - Yes. I did once. Then it may come back. I recommend you have medical treatment at the department of internal medicine. Is there albumin in my urine again? However, you only checked my eyes, I wonder you understood my medical history of kidney inflammation. Thank you. - Then I'll go to the department of internal medicine. - OK. By the way. - How are you related to Mr. Minowada? - To him? We are neighbors. Really, I didn't know it at all. Thank you. - You are Mr.Tokui, right? - Yes. Excuse me. Are you single? Yes, I'm single. Oh, dear! Is that so! You are single! Good-bye. Good-bye. To tell the truth, Mr. Masaki sent me a letter. And he asked my permission to marry you. What do you think about him? It's hard to say... I'd like to know your feelings. You may need time to think. Please think well. Sir, hello. - What do you want? - Please listen. - She is perfect for you. - Today I don't want to talk about it. You are in a bad mood today. What's the matter? Anyway, please listen to me. You know her. What do you think of a double-income family? I think it's just like you. She is... Dr. Katayama. Then, it's not a good idea for me. Why is it a bad idea? - I've had an argument with her. - An argument? It's a waste of time to argue about stupid things. I think she is angry with me. When we meet next time, she won't talk to me at all. Sister. Has something happened? What's up? I'm so stupid. I misjudged. Did you misjudge? Who? I deeply regret it. Oh, you are talking about him! He said he loves all the students. But he hit Hideo. Besides, he doesn't mind hitting a woman. Were you hit by him? What's the matter? Mr. Minowada doesn't hit a person for no reason. But, I can't forgive him, he knocked me down! Oh, I see. You were knocked down by him! All men are barbarians! "Exercise ground" Ms. Katayama! I'm here. Why are you crying? You should be in bed! I'm not sleepy. I want to see the fireflies! Hide. What were you doing before? What happened? It's natural Mr. Minowada scolded me. Why? Because... I didn't go to meet the spirits of the dead soldiers. Then you were bad! That's no good! It's your fault! Who is there? Who is it? Oh, Hide. You haven't gone to bed? I... I saw a strange thing. What did you see? I saw a woman crying like a child, even though she's an adult. Yasuko, do you cry sometimes? When grown women feel sad, we sometimes cry. I feel strange when grown women cry. You shouldn't say that. - But I saw it. - Who was crying? Ms. Katayama was crying. Where? At the timberyard. She may be there yet. I wonder if she's OK. It's because she argued with Mr. Minowada. Did she argue with him? - Is it true? - Yes. On the 29th of January, the national flag of Japan is fluttering in the wind. Pontianak, the capital of west Borneo. The Japanese armed forces broke through. They invaded from the northern hemisphere to the southern. The residents display the flag of Japan, and they are very busy making the flags. The army completed occupying Pontianak without delay. Mr. Masaki! Hi! - What a coincidence! - Yes. I'll go to the south at last. That's great! I want to go there, too. - Let's have a drink before parting. - What a good idea. I'm sorry, I can't draw. Is that true? And then? So, our project is, to translate, to interpret, and so on. While we are working, we will investigate and research the southern language, and classify dates. Oh, I see. However, if you go there, your family will have a problem, won't they? No problem. My sister is going to marry the head clerk of my family's shop. So, they'll take over the family business. How lucky you are, Mr. Masaki. Then, Mr. Yukawa and Yasuko... know about you? No, I haven't told them. I suppose Mr. Yukawa is interested in going south. Sir. I brought some paper. Please draw something. - Please draw as a souvenir. - You can draw anything you like. Anything you can. OK, I'll do it. Thank you! What are you doing? That's all. - I don't like it! - I'll give it you. You didn't draw. What? They won't allow me to join an investigating team? But...I'm at a loss for an answer. Mr. Masaki is worried about your health, so he agreed with me. - If something happened to you... - No, I don't understand! None of you understand my feelings at all. In this golden opportunity. This will be my last service to my country. But... I can never accept your way. However, sir, please. Please understand. Now, you are too old to go to south. Hello. Welcome. - Please sit down. - Thank you. - Mr. Yukawa has a visitor? - Yes. Just a moment, please. - Yasuko, do you know Mongolian? - No, I don't know it well. But, you can read and understand it? You are always helping your father. - Why mention this language? - Yesterday, I met Mr. Masaki by chance. He told me he's going south. - Yes, I heard. - Then we had a farewell drink. Later, I noticed this paper in my pocket. But, I don't understand what he wrote. Can you read it? I'm not sure if I can. Do you understand? I don't understand it. Let's ask my father later. Mr. Minowada! - I heard you got a telegram. - A telegram? - Mrs. Takamura is looking for you. - Thank you. I'll go. Good-bye. - Mr. Kokubo. - Yes. Do you think I'm so old? Yasuko is the best woman in this world. But I'll leave. Yasuko is the best woman in this world. But I'll leave. But I'll leave. - Are you preparing? - Yes. "Leave everything neat and tidy when you go". I'm too tired to go to some department stores. Thank you so much. Socks. Medicine. Shirts. Anyway, you need to prepare for your wedding, right? You needn't worry about that. I feel sorry for you. Because of me. Don't worry about it. First, you don't have any business ability. I'll keep our shop. So, don't worry about our business, and please work well! Thank you, Toshie. By the way, what are you doing about Yasuko? I gave up. You are talking about Mr. Masaki. Yes. How wonderful you've made up your mind. Yes. I think I'll be happy with him. I don't know why you have decided now, but I agree with you. As you know, before, all professions were inherited from generation to generation. So, the people developed their talent. You marry a person who is in the same field, and my study will be inherited. I'm pleased with it. But. When I marry, I can't take care of you. I can't leave you. Thank you for your kindness, but you needn't worry about it. To tell the truth, I'll go south with Mr. Masaki. Really? It was decided? To the south! Don't worry. I want you to come with us. Me, too? Mr. Kokubo said you can come as my assistant. - Really? - Yes. Don't you want to come as my assistant? Certainly, with pleasure! Really? Thank you. Where are you going? Who are you calling? I'll call Masaki with your answer. He'll be leaving soon. He'll feel encouraged by you. Hello, is this the Masaki family? This is Yukawa. Is Nobuo there? Can I speak to Nobuo? The left. The top. Doctor. You can go home. Thank you. About that matter, you haven't decided yet. About Mr. Minowada. Hello. Yes, it is. Yes, she is. Doctor. From your brother. It's an emergency! Hello, it's me. What? Mr. Minowada? What happened to Mr. Minowada? But... I may arrange to attend the meeting... Has something happened? To tell the truth, I need to tell you. From tomorrow I need to part from you. I'll go home and be a soldier. - How nice! - Thank you. - Mr. Minowada, Banzai! - Wait, wait! You shouldn't jump to conclusions. If I went to the front, I'd be happy. But now it's for military training. Military training I'm your teacher, but from tomorrow I'll be in first grade as a soldier. You are in the fifth grade. So I'll be a lower grade student than you. I'll be in the first grade, but I like to make an effort. When I come back here, I'll have learned something important from military life. And I'll grow up as a person. Then, I'll ask a favor of you. Become good boys. Good! Lower your hands. Now, I want you to tell me your bad habits. And I want you to promise me to alter them. OK. Suddenly you've calmed down. - Tokui. - I have a habit of snitching on my classmates. I haven't altered it. Really. - Andou. - Yes! - I have a runny nose. I'll wipe it soon. - Good! Abe. Let's start the ceremony. Stand to attention. Make a bow from afar. Bow very low. Stand at ease. To thank the spirits of dead soldiers in Yasukuni Shrine. And to wish the Japanese armed forces victory. Pray silently. Now, let's give a farewell party. For Mr. Yukawa, to go to the south. And for Mr. Minowada, to be given military training. We had a meeting of the neighborhood here everytime. We need to have a farewell party today. It's sad in fact. But it's an honorable opportunity for them. We wish them good luck. So let's have a good time tonight. I take my best sake today. Please pour the sake. Thank you for coming tonight. My daughter and I will never forget your kind party. And about my health, everyone is worried about it. I know I'm old. But I follow the third army of General Nogi... Father. Anyhow, I'm OK. My neighborhood will take care of this house. I can leave without any worries. Thank you. Mr. Minowada, please. I'll come back in 3 months, so I don't have the right to a farewell party like this. But, I'll work hard as a first grader. Thank you. And he is Mr. Tokui, an expected participant. Please look after him. I'm Tokui. My nickname is Daruma. It's named by Mr. Minowada. I'm pleased to meet you. Let's do without the formalities and make ourselves at home. Here you are. Thank you. Please. Good boy, Hide! Flattery won't work with me! - Why do you think like that? - I don't know. I'm sure. If a person likes someone, they will never quarrel with the other. And... I suppose he will never hit his wife. You should talk with him before his departure. I can't do it. You said before that you would come and play fair with your favorite man. You said that, didn't you? - Miss, please. - Yes. I won't be long. - Let's go there. - Yes. Mr. Yukawa, is there snow at the equator? Snow? I suppose there is. I heard there's a mountain more than 4000 meters high. So maybe there is snow from ancient times in the valley. It's eternal fresh snow. In other words, the snow of hope. It's called "Hot Ice", isn't it? Is it "Hot Ice"? When we arrive there, let's go to this mountain and put up the national flag! Let's toast! To their health! - Here you are. - Thank you. - I wish you good health. - You, too. Please say hello to Mr. Masaki. You should marry for your mother's sake. Ms. Katayama! - Please come here. - Yes. Here you are. I'm sorry for the other day. Thank you. I wish you good health. Thank you. Take care of yourself. - Mr. Minowada, you like beer, right? - Don't worry, I like sake, too. - Here you are. - Thank you. - Can you do something? - I'll sing a dormitory song. It's for Mr. Yukawa. A hill with the crimson flowers A riverbank with the fresh green Sing to the flowers of the city The moon is out on Mt. Yoshida The dewdrop on the fresh green lawns in summer When we look up to the stars We are full of hope We fill with emotion Our hometowns, the fields, the flowers Here are 600 hopeful hearts At the door of spring Sing without seeing the ancient city's moon Ms. Katayama. I was wrong. Yasuko, you do like Mr. Minowada, don't you? You gave up him, didn't you? - Because of me. - No, I didn't. Ms. Katayama. I hope you will make up with him soon. I wish you happiness. Forward march! Right face... Move! Straight! About face... Move! I'm glad if you are fine. Every early morning I shoulder a rifle in training. I want you to see me when I'm in military uniform. For the letters from all of my students, my colleagues greatly envy me. All of the soldiers like the children. When you meet some soldiers in the street, you can say "Hello!" to them. They will greet you with a "Hello!" and a smile. Say hello to your mother. I await your next letter. Show me! You haven't received his letter? I'll go to show his letter to my friends. Hello! Dr. Katayama - Your family are not at home? - No. I've received a letter from Mr. Minowada. Then, I'll tell you. I'm happy-go-lucky by nature, but I enjoy the strict rules and training of army life. I'd like to tell you something else. Here. When I come back, bearing in mind my mother's wishes, about Ms. Katayama, I'll have an important matter to discuss with you. What do you think? He wrote "an important matter". What will he discuss with me? You know very well! Yes. From Mr. Minowada? Is that right? He wrote you. What a nice day today! In the army, we have new training. This training is to produce stronger soldiers. Then we'll have training to build up our physical strength. But I'm good at this, so I think I'll soon be a model soldier. Oh, I nearly forget to write. On return, I'll have an important matter to discuss with you. Please prepare for it! THE END
