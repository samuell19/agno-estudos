The convict, despite being a man of law, has broken the law. He has broken the trust of the citizens of this country. He has made many go bankrupt and driven them to suicide. The convict is accused of embezzling Rs.2500 crores. l request the court to remand the accused to police custody... for at least a month so that this scandal is exposed. And justice given to the innocent citizens. Considering the case as sensitive... the court accepts the request of the public prosecutor. And orders the accused to be under the purview of the chief minister. Sorry sir, you cannot go beyond this. Come, sir. Thank you for accepting my call and coming to meet me. l had to come, since you are our special guest. Why did you call me? - We need to talk. lt's important. ln private. You are aware that l am accused of embezzling Rs.2500 crores. lt will be very difficult to prove whether this charge is true or not. And even if it is true, where is all that money? lt will take very long to find it. We have lots of time, Mr.Shah, don't worry about that. Look Chief Minister, this is an issue that involves Rs.2500 crores. Half of it is Rs.1250 crores. ln lndia's population of 80 crores... there must not be anyone who has that kind of money. You can have it... if you get me out of the country. What do you say? Why think so much? Opportunity knocks on the door only once. How did you like my reply? Natwar Shah, you are a very weak person. When a woman becomes weak, she begins to sell herself. And when a man becomes weak, he becomes a cheat and criminal like you. You want me to break the trust of 80 crore people for Rs.1250 crores? Make the poor and hungry population of the country more poor & more hungry? The money you have embezzled is not your money... but is the savings of those millions of people. l have promised myself that until... l take an account of every penny of Rs.2500 crore from you... l will not let you rest in peace. Have you managed to do anything? - lt is very difficult. The truth is that it is impossible to get Natwar out of jail. Why? The chief minister has made the security around him so strict... that it is impossible to reach him. Are you trying to say that there is no way out? There is one way. Only two people can make this possible. Who? - One is the chief minister himself. And the other? - Tejeshwar. Move! No one will move. Get on the floor. Down on the floor! Let's go. What happened? This is unbelievable! Did those thieves have to loot only this shop? Are you a partner in this shop? - No... but this shop belongs to my dear childhood friend, Hasmukh. He's here, Hasmukh has come. Here he is. Have courage, Hasmukh. Who can avert what is destined? But don't let this loss worry you. My salary is very small, but l won't let you go hungry. l will give you half my salary. A friend promises you. You will give me half your salary? He's gone mad. Oh God! my friend has gone mad. ln fact, God has saved me from turning mad. How? - l had sold my shop two days ago. What...? To whom? - To Sukhiram. l didn't want to, but he insisted and even paid me for it. Andu Pandu, take Rs.10 and get some sweets. This calls for a celebration. lnspector, l'm ruined and you are calling for sweets? Respect your uniform. At least show me false sympathy. l'm sorry, but l have called for sweets because my friend was saved. And where your ruin is concerned, the police will help you. And the police has inspector Pyare Mohan in its force... who will not let the villain live in peace. He won't even let him drink in peace. lt's our man from the police. Tejeshwar, this is Pravinbhai. - l know, l know everything about him His job will be done. How much money will you pay us? lf you succeed in getting my brother out of the country... your next 70 generations will not have to work ever again. Here's the advance money. Can you expect yourself to do this job? Not just expect, we are confident we can do it. Maybe you are not aware of the plan we have made. What do you want? Have your fun, but remember... that the crime you are committing... will one day boomerang on you. You ass, we need your help for this crime. We've kidnapped you and will commit this crime in the presence of law. The law cannot harm us. But that will be possible only if we help you. Kill us if you like... but we will not betray our country. Enough of this! Hey you distinguished doctors! He is the respected Chief Minister. He is obsessed about doing good and we are obsessed about doing bad. Your life and death is not in my hands now. lt is in your own hands. The sooner you do our job,the sooner you will go back to your family. So do what we are saying. This will be fun. We will rule with the approval of the government. We will put a stop to everything else... and do only one thing now. - What? We will keep a constant watch on the chief minister. You stupid ass! l'll wring your neck and kill you. You either dip my finger in hot tea or pour cold water on me. What are you punishing me for, you dog! Oh, so you get annoyed if l call you a dog. That moment was inauspicious when my sons brought you home... and seeing your innocent face, l accepted you in. But l didn't expect you to terrorise your own master. l'm telling you! Don't come near me, l'm not talking to you. You came and sat in my lap to appease me. Listen to me. Reform yourself. As it is, l am harassed by my good-for-nothing sons. lf you reform yourself, half my problems will be solved. You will reform, won't you? He wet my clothes! Forget it, mother! lt's 10:30 already, but your useless grandsons must still be in bed. Have a heart! You are always after them. They have already left for college. - They have?! They will get their results today. Your grandsons are amazing. They are good at being naughty and good at studies too. Sir, there is a call for you from the boys college. Hello... Yes, speaking. But... All right. The principal had come home for breakfast two days ago. He has called me to the college, that too the first time. This time, our grandsons must have secured even better marks. More than 95% ...? Excuse me. The principal's office...? - First floor. But what is the matter? l'm the principal. You...? How can you be the principal? Some other principal has been coming to my house for the last few years. Who are you? - l'm Hasmukh Rai... father of Bunnu and Munnu. - You are Bunnu and Munnu's father? Yes. Any doubts? The man who they have been bringing to college as their dad... since the last three years, is someone else. Fraud...? - And l have called you here... to inform you that l have rusticated them from college. Because they have been failing their exams since the last 3 years. But they have been getting 90- 95 % marks and you say... Actually, your sons have never scored more than 9 % marks. What?! Look at them, they are our college's best students. They scored 98 % marks this year. Your sons beat them up and snatched their marksheets. They even stole the best student shield from my office. Now l know where they get the marksheets and the shield from. Grandma! - Son! Look, we have got the best student shield. We will even get scholarship now. Hug us, daddy! You know what wonderful marks we've got this time? 98 %! And here's the marksheet. - Bless you, son! Only one answer went wrong, or if we had scored 100 %... we would've broken the world record. - A lot is going to break today. Really? - Look, the principal is here, too. l think he wants to congratulate us. - Congratulations, Mr.Rai! What wonderful sons you have! They are invaluable. They are the honour of your house and the glory of our college. You are overdoing it. - Let him, l'm enjoying it. When l tell people l am the principal of Xavier's college,... do you know what they say? - What? The same college in which Bunnu and Munnu are? Did you see their mark sheet? 98 %! We must celebrate with sweets. l'm desperate to celebrate since morning. Come upstairs. Will you only give him sweets? - Won't you give us? He is elder to you, let me give him sweets first, then l'll give you. Congratulations! - Come upstairs with me. l know you were a boxer, but why are you wearing those gloves now? Because l know you were a thief. You've been going to my sons college as their father since three years. And you come here as their principal. After today's beatings you'll never play a father. You'll be even ashamed to have fathered sons! Help! You beat the principal?! - lt's now the turn of his students. No! What are you doing? - Beating them black and blue! They snatched my laughter the day they were born. Do you know that these two have been failing exams since the last 3 years? What?! That shield is not theirs, they have stolen it. Even the marksheet is not theirs, they have snatched it from a bright student They stole? - Yes. Let me show you their real marksheet. He has scored 9, and he's scored 10. - l have scored one more than you! Don't beat him. He is right. Munnu, he's got the gun. Run! Are you hit? Hey, wait! let us get in the car at least. Stop! Are you headed straight? Since we got into a soup going wayward, we've decided to go straight Straight! - Can you give me a lift? My car broke down. Does your driver drive well? He even pilots a plane. But why are you so afraid? My life is very precious. l have not done anything in my life yet. l'm going to see a girl for myself. Which girl are you going to be cruel to? What? - He means... where are you going to see this girl? - There is a small hill station... nearby, Sangampur. l'm going there. - How does the girl look? l haven't seen her yet. - You haven't seen the girl yet? Even she hasn't seen me. And the girl's family? - Even they haven't. Our elders had finalised this proposal. Arranged marriage, you see. What's your name? - Gullu. Give your school name, stupid. - He means, give your full name. Gulshan Kapoor! - Gulshan Kapoor! Note it. What is your father's name? - Heerachand Kapoor. Note it. - He's from Delhi, note that too. Where do you live? - ln Bombay. Note it. ls this girl from Sangampur? - No, she is from Bombay... but she has come to her farm house here.They are very rich people. Noted it down! - Why are you noting down all this? Why are you laughing? - Wonder why when we see you... we get the feeling that you are buried neck deep. You rogues! l've made the biggest mistake of my life by taking a lift from you. Exactly. - You dogs! Right! - Rogues! Right! - At least tell me what you want. Just some rest of 10-15 days. Father has chucked us out. - So we will go to see the girl. He will be Gulshan, and l will be his friend Ranjit. l cannot remove my hands out, but believe me... l am begging you to have mercy on me. l was going to find my life's first happiness. That has nothing to do with our sorrow. Besides, we are not that bad. We have arranged for your food and drink. Here's yourjuice and milk. - Do your otherjobs underground only Give me my clothes! How will l come out in the nude? Bajrangi, you drive very roughly nowadays. This house is good. - l hope the food is good too. lf you think you can fool me, you are mistaken. Because l have recognised you. What?! - Yes. Now... yes, you are Gulshan! And he must be your friend. - You are amazing! l am his friend Ranjit. And he is our friend Shakti. This woman looks elderly. - Very elderly. As if you have to marry her. - Did you say something? Why haven't you married yet? Actually, l never met a man like you until now, son. Son...? - Laxmi, is baby ready? She is the relative of the girl, the girl is getting dressed upstairs. You look so beautiful that the boy will swoon the moment he sees you... and immediately accept your proposal. Who is the girl among them? - Both are girls, stupid! Which one is mine? - The girl besides my girl is yours. But who is baby? - Whoever! But the one in green is my girl. Thank God! lt is the first time our tastes haven't matched. l don't know who has come to see you, but both the guys are good. They are okay. - Who is more okay? The one standing besides aunt. Good. l hope he is the one who has come to see you. Because l find his friend more than okay. Baby, why are you standing there, come here. Baby, this is Gulshan. Aunty, he is Gulshan, l am his friend Ranjit. But you just said outside that he... - Sorry aunt... but you said with so much confidence that you recognise us. Besides, we don't argue with elders. Madam, it is their dad's call. - Daddy! He must be wanting to know if l have reached safely. Excuse me please. l'll talk to him. Gulshan my son, my darling, did you reach safely? Yes. - What's wrong with your voice? l had split milk tea on my way here. l'll gargle with salt water. All right, come back tomorrow. - Yes. What? You are going to Kanpur tomorrow? Then l'll stay back here for 2-3 days. Aunty is very nice, even the girl is very nice. l find these guys to be over smart. - Even l think so. Even we'll get up early from tomorrow. Exercise is a good thing. Our exercise will be watching them exercising. What are you'll doing here? We're watching how well you exercise. We know what you are watching. Ritu, these guys are cunning and over smart. Don't say that sister-in-law, l'm her to-be husband. You are nobody, l don't want to marry you. Neither me. - Hey, listen! What is my girl's name? - l don't even know my girl's name. How stupid we are! We are here since yesterday and we haven't yet asked them their name. Let's go and ask them. Where to...? Stand in queue. - l'm not here to buy cinema tickets. l have come to collect money l gave Bunnu and Munnu. Sonofagun! You ruin my sons' lives by giving them loans... and then dare to talk loudly with me? And what are you all standing in queue for like beggars? l won't give any of you a single penny. Get out! This man is worst than his sons. - Want a kick? Bloody beggar! You call us beggars? - Your father's a beggar, too! This man is shameless. We'll recover our money from Bunnu and Munnu. Let's go. Hasmukhlal be damned! Did you hear that? My sons disgrace me like this everyday. These petty people come to my house, curse me and leave. There is not a single shop left from where they haven't taken credit. They blow Rs.800 on cigarettes alone. - Pity you, but have courage. You reap as you sow. - What have l sowed to reap this? You have only one daughter. You are lucky. Even if l had two daughters... l would've been a happier man. - Sure you would have. You should have had daughters just like your sons are. They would disgrace you and you'd have to commit suicide. They would paint the town red... - Do you have any shame? You just talk anything! Sonofagun! - Sorry. Tell me, what brought you here? - l had come for some work. l forgot. Why am l here? - Get yourself treated. Why are you giving the police a bad name? How is your daughter? - Oh yes! l had come for her only. He's laughing! Priya has gone to Sangampur with her friend. She had said she will return in two days, but hasn't, so l'm going there. l want your big car. One minute! The big car? - Yes. Are you going to bring back your daughter or meet your lover? Don't you feel ashamed to keep a lover at your age? You haven't seen her. - l'm don't even want to. When you see her, you'll know what a simmering beauty she is. Like a ruined star? - She's devastating! Shall l tell you something? Even you will go wild when you see her. Me? l am not like you, l'm a principled man. l have never looked at a woman. - How can you? You will look at women only if your sons let you. Shall l tell you something? However naughty my sons may be... but without them, this house seems lonely. lt is seven days since they have gone. l feel depressed. Wonder where they will be. - Come on! You horrible monkey! Did you have to put out your cigarette on my butt? lt is said that dogs are most loyal, but you are more loyal than anybody. You're standing guard since six days and won't let me enter. l'm going to marry that girl. l wonder what your master must be doing with her. Priya, you haven't slept in your room today? Anyway, it's good, we can have a chat. Say something, Ritu. Why are you turned the other way? Turn on my side. l'm thinking of telling aunt that... l am ready to marry Gulshan. What d'you say? They are nice men. And l think they even love us. What say you? That is why, though they're here since a week,they don't want to leave. l think, until we stay annoyed with them, they will not leave. No way. Priya, shall l tell you the truth? - Yes. For the first time l've felt something stir in my heart on seeing someone. Same here. l don't know why l feel that he should always be around me and... What happened to your hands? What happened? Nothing, aunt. A fat rat had sneaked into my room. l drove it out. Okay. lt's very late. Switch off the lights and go to sleep. What are you doing here? - l've come to find out how you feel. Go from here, please! l'll go, but at least give me a kiss. All right... only one. Priya, where are you? ''l wanna date you'' What are you staring at? What makes you stare at me? l have come to take Priya. - The kids have gone out. They'll be back soon. - You mean there is no one home? Why...? Well, l'm home. This is your chance. Miss it, and you'll miss it forever. Anu, did Ritu like the boy who had come to see her? Yes. l think we'll have the marriage soon. That's nice, but you will become very lonely after she gets married. lt can't be helped. Even l will become lonely after my daughter Priya gets married. A desolate house will depress me. That is why... - You are planning to marry again? l'm busy all day. l must have a reason to return home at nights. Shall l tell you something? ''No life without wife.'' Have you seen a girl for yourself? - Yes, since two years. 50% of the relationship is finalised. - 50 % ...? Yes, from my side. The other 50 % approval has to come from her. Then why don't you ask her? - l'm afraid she may get angry. That is the drawback men have. They unnecessarily get worried. That is what l was going to... The kids. Bad timing! You're back! Priya, your daddy is here. What? - Yes. When did you come? - Just now. Wastrels! What are you two doing here? Do you know them? - Only too well. The scoundrels! They were missing since a week. Do you know how worried your father is about you? Why is he worried? We had informed him. The world is so small. Take them for example. You know Gulshan and Ranjit and their father Heerachand too. Heerachand? Who is Heerachand? - How forgetful you are! You met daddy yesterday? - Yes. And you still ask who Heerachand is? But how is Heerachand connected with your daddy, Bunnu? Bunnu...? Who is Bunnu? - He. What's all this about, Munnu? - Munnu? Look aunty, he is calling me too by a wrong name. My name is not Munnu, l'm Ranjit. ls that Bajrangi or someone else? He is Bajrangi and he has kept the ignition on. Why? - Because it's now time to escape. Where are you'll going? Anu, you have been cheated. - Cheated? Yes. They are the sons of my old friend Hasmukh. Gulshan and... l mean, Bunnu and Munnu. Daddy! - You're back again? Beat me if you like, but save Bunnu first. He has met with an accident. What?! - And he has lost his memory. Look. Bunnu, what happened to you? Wait a minute, mother. What kind of an accident was that? l don't see any injury. - This is an internal injury. The car ran over his brain. And he went mad. l'm not mad. - See! The world goes on the moon, l will go on the sun. But the sun is very hot, there is only fire there. That's exactly why l have preferred to enter it in the night. Happy now? Beat him more! l'm not their enemy, l beat them so that they don't go wayward. Now go and call the doctor. - l'll call him right away. Bunnu, what happened to you? Where's your master? Are you Mr.Hasmukh? ''For the first time l see love in the eyes of my beloved'' Are you Mr.Hasmukh? Yes... tell... me. l've come to you with a complaint. - But l don't even know you. Have l done something wrong? - lt is your sons who have wronged. Do you know what they have done? They had been fooling me and my nieces since a week. All that's fine, but what if acting mad, l actually go mad? Whether you go mad or not, dad will surely go mad. Do you remember anything? This is daddy. Daddy? What is daddy? - He is like me. He is one foolish fellow who takes the burden of his kids. That reminds him of something? - No, daddy. l'm trying since long... but he cannot remember anything. - You must be tired. Come downstairs son, you'll remember everything. Son brings me up. Father takes me down. All right let's go. l'm not afraid of anybody. Do you see them? Easy, easy. Remember anything? - No. Then why the shocked expression? - Just like that, daddy. You have regained half your memory. l'll help you regain the other half. Don't! Don't beat a patient. - Patient? l'll make you both patients. Aunty, please forgive us for our mistake. Daddy is very hot, please cool him. What?! - lt was tough getting into the house Please do something or he'll throw us out of the house again. That is your punishment, that you are thrown out of your house forever. You deserve to go hungry on the streets. We are not so useless. We can work hard and earn a living. Henceforth, you will have to work and earn a living. You are saying that? - Just earn two bucks and show me. You are challenging us? - Yes! l know how useless you are. Didn't you feel ashamed to do such a lowly act with this decent family? Ashamed? What for? We love them. What's your problem, dad? lf you cannot find the words, forget it. What did you say? Get out! We are not garbage that you throw us out of the house again and again. Those who don't follow my orders are thrown out. This is my house. Your house? - Yes! We assumed this to be our house until now. But you have opened our eyes today. We will become something and show you. Then even if you beg us, we will not come back. Stick to your words! - l was only joking. Get out! Aunty, thanks for creating a rift between a father and his sons. Let's go, Bajrangi. See, even a monkey understands, but you don't. Friends, well wishers... those who cheat and loot... and those who kill for money... better than those is my monkey who earns money for his masters... and leads a quiet life. So please applaud my monkey! What is he doing here? lt is not their fault. Kids tend to go wayward if they lose their mother so early in life. l tried my best to give them both, a father and mother's love. But today l realise that no one can take a mother's place. You realise that now? Were your senses asleep since so many years? Pardon me, but you should have got married long ago... if not for yourself, then at least for your sons. Why didn't you? - l used to love my wife very much. l haven't found anyone like her until today. Until today? - No, until a few days back. But now l think my sons will very soon get a mother. lndeed! By the way, what is your programme for today? Nothing important. - Then shall we go out for a coffee? lt will be an outing and... - Not a bad idea. Let's go. Great! Just a minute. This flower was waiting to adorn your hair. lf... Please. - My pleasure. ''My friend is no more a friend'' ''My lover remains no more my lover'' ''O Life, l don't trust you anymore'' Come off it. You are my childhood friend, aren't you? Childhood friend? lf you knew the real meaning of friendship... you wouldn't back stab your friend. When did l back stab you? What nonsense are you talking? Am l? Hadn't you gone to Anuradha's house yesterday? Anuradha...? Yes, but what has that got to do with back stabbing? The way you talk like as if you know nothing. She is the lover of your childhood friend. Who?... Anu... What are you saying! Honestly, l didn't know you love her. l'm sorry, l didn't know. You liar, you know that woman is my life. l used to take your car and go to Sangampur. For what? You had told me but l didn't remember. l forgot. lt is l who tends to forget, how did you forget? Shall l tell you the truth? You didn't forget, your intention was bad. Before looking at her, you should have given a thought... to the fact that you are eying your sister-in-law. lt was she who looked at me first. - Really? And she fell in love with me at first sight. She loves me. We are having an affair since the last two years. You are mistaken, she loves me. We'll confirm that in the evening. - On her birthday party? You know even that? Doesn't matter. You can check in the evening who she is paying more attention to. Whether you or me. - Fine. The evening will decide whose wife she will be and whose sister-in-law. Thank you! Excuse me, l'll be right back. Yellow and red. They look beautiful! Woman is such a wonderful creation of God. You like her even when she's angry. - Yes. ls everything all right? - By your grace, it is. Excuse me. Hasmukh, she is paying equal attention to both of us. l think she loves both of us. So one of us will have to sacrifice our love. But who will make that sacrifice? We have been to school and college together. We have shared ourjoys and sorrows. You want our friendship of years to break for one woman? No. That's why l'm saying that one of us will have to sacrifice. That is what l'm asking you, who will make that sacrifice? Who will make the sacrifice? You will! l will not make any sacrifice. You will have to sacrifice! Are you asking for a sacrifice or a refund of credit? Get lost! Stupid fellow! You pushed me? Me? - Yes! For a love two days old, you beat an old friend of yours? l will not spare you! - Then get into the ring! Sure! lf you are a boxer, then l am a champion in karate. Hold me, or l will break his head. Please uncle! Control yourself! Why are you two fighting? On the issue of marriage. But whose marriage? l forgot. Hasmukh, what were we fighting over? Why this fight for the first time among old friends? Whose marriage were you talking about? - Munnu's marriage! l told him that since Munnu loves his daughter... we will now become relatives. But he got angry on me. l'm bound to get angry. l have only one daughter. Getting her married to your son would be sending her to hell. You're insulting my brother in public! Enough of your nonsense! Bunnu, wait. Uncle, before giving your decision, ask how your daughter feels. She loves me very much. No, daddy. Love? With you? Ritu and l hate you both. Hey, listen! That's your car, isn't it? Who are they? Acquaintances. Stay here, we'll be right back. Hello! What brings you'll here? We are taking your car. Repay our loans within two days... or we will sell this car and recover our money. Don't threaten us. We will throw your money on your face tomorrow. He means to say that we will return your money. But today, don't take... - Look, if we speak loudly... you'll lose face. So quietly allow us to take the car. Get that? These girls are here or... Drive carefully! Munnu, it's good you gave them the car. One mustn't break a poor man's heart. - But who were these poor men? They live in the shanties behind our bungalow. There's a wedding in their family tomorrow. They thought of taking the wedding procession in a car. So l gave them my car. - l wasn't ready to give them the car But it was only after meeting you that l realised what marriage is. So l agreed to give them the car. Now what do we do? - Steal. Thief! - What are you doing! Mr.Rai, l have come to steal here at their insistence. You dare to lie! You dare to fool daddy! The lowliest of man will not steal in his own house. lsn't it, dad? Mr.Rai, l swear... Mr.Rai! Before wearing your gloves, listen to this. What! ln your own house? Yes. Our old man will not simply give us money. lf father's wealth is not used by his sons, it will rot in the vaults. lf we steal in someone else's house, we will go to jail. But if we get caught in our own house, we'll say we were joking. l knew l could not trust you. That is why l taped this to protect myself. Look. Look at it. Mr.Rai, it is not my fault. lt was on their insistence... lf they ask you to jump in a well, will you? Locked...? - Try fleeing. A lock here too? Bunnu, all routes to our escape are locked. Who locked all doors? - l have. So that before throwing you out of the house, l give you a good thrashing You have been very evil today. - How true! You robbed your own house? You'll go for a bigger heist next. - Oh come on, dad. Then you'll have me murdered. - No, you're our father after all. Only until now. From now on, neither am l your father, nor are you my sons. You'll have to keep one relationship, either of the father, or the sons. What did you say? - Or you will regret it. Or we will do what you have never even dreamt of. Hasmukh! Why are you beating my grandsons? Grandma, save us! You think yourself to be a great boxer! Give one glove each to my grandsons, then you'll know. Take the gloves and fulfill the desire of your grandma. No daddy, how can we fight with you? Let's take the back-door out! Where were you taking the car? This is not your uncle's car, neither is it of those two monkeys. They must have jumped the back wall and escaped. Now your punishment is that you will stay here with me. Give me the key... and come inside or l'll thrash you. Can't you see! What are you doing? You should take care of the child. Do you know whose child this is? - Whosoever's! A child is a child. He is the chief minister's son. - So what?... What!! l don't know how to thank you. You put your lives at stake and saved my son. l can never repay this favour. lf l can ever be of any help to you, l'll be very happy to oblige. lt is we who are pleased that we could meet you on this pretext. We never imagined even in our dreams that we would have tea with you. Notjust tea, you must even have dinner with us today. Of course. - That wasn't necessary. lt is notjust me, but even Chirag who wants that. You must join us for the party tonight. You have given great joy to a mother today. Today is Chirag's birthday. - What?! Happy birthday, kid. - May you live long. lf you don't come for the party, l will not cut the cake. We will surely come. He has already become friends with you. Excuse me sir, the party workers are waiting for you. Even the press is going to arrive. - Did they have to come now? What is the matter, sir? - You must be reading in the papers... that bank robberies and kidnapping cases are on the rise. The government is answerable. lt is important, else l'd have sat with you What happened? - l think we have a flat tyre. We're from the press. We got an appointment with the chief minister. Just a minute. Hello... Some press persons are here. They say they have an appointment with the CM. Let them in. - Okay. Are you all right sir? Bunnu, what's going on here? - Hush. The chief minister...? But he is... Who says there are no good doctors in lndia? Something terrible is going on here. - That's true. Exactly like the chief minister. Greatjob done, doctors! Notjust the world,... even if the CM himself sees this, he will be shocked. Well done, doctors! You have made our dreams come true. You must be rewarded for the greatjob done. The CM must have got admitted to the hospital by now. That is the only place from where he can be kidnapped and... Sarang put in his place. Munnu, run away! l said go! - l will not leave you. Don't be stupid. lt is very necessary to expose them. Or the secret we know will remain a secret. Come what may, l will not leave you alone to face death. We will live together and die together. Try to understand. lf you escape... until l don't tell them about you, they cannot kill me. No, Bunnu. - lf they catch both of us... they will kill us. Munnu go, for my sake, go! No, Bunnu. - l said go! Go and inform the police and daddy. And don't worry about me, l'll come to no harm. l don't think he is from the police. Whether he is from the police or not, but he has become a risk for us. What you and your friend know was the result of our month long effort. After knowing this secret, you cannot get out of here alive. That is for sure. But your death can become easier if you tell us your friend's name. And where he has gone from here. Tell us, or you will die an agonising death. Do what you like, but l will not let a rogue like you become the CM. l will die, but not reveal my friend's whereabouts to you. Tell us, darling. Tell us, please! l cannot bear to see you in pain. Tell us. You're back? Where is Bunnu? - He is in trouble. The whole world is in trouble because of you, how can you be in trouble? Last time you said he lost his memory. What are you going to say now? Believe me, daddy. Some dangerous gangsters have held Bunnu captive. They plan to kidnap the chief minister. The chief minister? - Yes. Couldn't you tell a bigger lie? Plan to kidnap the prime minister, the president! You liar! l'm telling the truth. - Shut-up, you swine! Grandma, please tell him. Until when will you trouble your father with your pranks? You are saying this, grandma? - Yes! lt is not right to always lie like that. Then even when you are telling the truth, people will not believe you. Why don't you understand this? True, grandma. My truth is being treated as a lie today. But Bunnu's life is really in danger. We beat him mercilessly, but he refuses to reveal anything. Then kill him. Take this. What is the matter? Daddy, leave immediately with Munnu, he needs your help. Why do you'll look so perturbed? - Only you can help me now. No one is believing me. Daddy and Grandma think l am joking like always But this time, l'm neither joking, nor lying. Tell me in short what has happened. l am an eye witness to the attack on the CM. What? - Yes, and l know those criminals. l have seen all of them. l even know where they are. They have made a dangerous plan. - Plan...? They want to kidnap the CM and put his lookalike in his place. Look a like? - He isn't really his look a like but... Stop your nonsense, Bunnu. This is not your house... but the police station. Do you know what it means to play pranks here? What is the matter? Why aren't you believing this man? Because l know him since he was small. Since their childhood, they have never said anything but lies. They have always troubled their father, but now this is too much! Maybe he is lying, but what if he says is even one percent true... then who will be responsible? Sir, believe me, l'm telling the truth. Please help me. My brother is in their custody. Sir, do something or he may lose his life. Don't worry, the law is meant to protect people. Besides, this involves the chief minister. Truth or lies, we'll have to go with you. Come, sir. How is this possible? Priya, everything has changed here. Everything has changed here. Neither those gangsters... nor my brother is here. This place has totally changed. Sometimes you say the CM will change,... sometimes you say the place has changed. You are fooling the law. Sir, l'd warned you that coming with him would be waste of time. He's a liar! - l'm not lying. l'm myself surprised about the change in this place. How can so much change occur in one night? You! You brought the police here yourself? Sir, arrest him. He killed his brother yesterday. He was putting the body in the car and escaping... when l tried to catch him. He managed to escape, but l got hold of his coat. She is lying! She is an accomplice of those goons. Believe me, this is a conspiracy against me. Hold on! Old woman, how did you know that the deceased was his brother? Because before dying, he was saying,... ''Why are you killing me, l am your brother after all.'' You witch, l will not spare you! Where is my brother, tell me! Tell me, or l will kill you! You are making a grave mistake, sir. Believe me, my brother is alive. He is in their custody. What are you doing, sir? He is Munnu, my friend's son, l know him. He can tell 1a thousand lies but he cannot kill his brother. Only this old woman has said this, we have no other proof. lnspector Pyare, l have no personal enmity with your friend's son. But this woman says that she has seen him kill his brother. And until his brother is found, Munnu will remain in police custody. The body is totally decomposed, sir. lt is very difficult to identify. Don't worry, we will know from the chain and watch found on his body. lt was difficult for the police to identify the body found... but we have found Bunnu's watch and chain on the body. lnspector, this is a elaborate prank they are playing. Prank? - Yes. When they left home, they had threatened me... that they will do something which l must never have even dreamt of. And this is what they have done. One put his chain and watch on some dead body... and the other went in jail so that their father becomes frantic. But this time l won't be fooled by them. l hope what he is saying is true. But to say it in short, the police has found a body. lf Bunnu does not present himself in 2-3 days... then he hasn't realised what big trouble Munnu will fall into. Oh God, please let Bunnu be safe wherever he is. God, save me! Damn you, Gauri Shanker! This is my twelfth pot you have broken this month. Scoundrel! Run Yadav, my honour is at stake! First l broke the pot, then l hung in the air, and now l'm thrown here. Save me, God. Gauri Shanker. - What happened? Come out, Moti has gone. He has? The naughty dog! He acts too smart. Wasn't as nice thing to do. O my God! Gauri Shanker! You! O God, pardon me, l have made a grave mistake. You are great! l suffered a loss, my roof broke, you saw me in this state... and you seek pardon from God? l'm sorry Chandramukhi, but this happened because of your dog. That is why l fell here by mistake. Why didn't you commit this mistake before, Gauri? l'm so helpless. Look Chanda... don't try to get close to me, stay away! Don't act smart with me. l'll shout and collect the whole village here. Shameless man, you enter a single woman's house through the roof. Moreover, you threaten her. You will have to pay for this mistake of yours. Take what you want and just leave me alone. Give me a kiss. O my God, such helplessness! Kiss... l didn't know you were so ardent. l hadn't expected you to be so happy at the mention of a kiss. ls my touch so electrifying? O my God! Uncle, Gauri Shanker broke my pot again today. Good God! l am fed up of putting sense into him. lt is not difficult to put sense into him. lf you allow me, l can do it in a minute. Do what? Will you knock sense into me? - He misbehaved, and now he threatens Why are you talking to father, talk to me. l know everything. You instigate these people and bring them here. Stop this act of yours or if l get angry, you'll regret it. What can you do to us if you get angry? What can you do? - Nothing, l'll just break yourjaw! Leave him, or l'll kill myself. What are you doing, father? - Don't touch me! You will ruin me one day. l am sick of your antics! Therefore, l close my doors on you. No room for you in my house. Get out! - Going. Then go. - l'm going! What do you think, that if you throw me out, l'll go hungry? There are many who will feed me. - Get lost! You don't need to lecture me before the villagers. What Gauri Shanker? He throws me out of the house on every pretext. Always telling me to get out, get lost! As if l had no respect. l knew beforehand that l'm going to be thrown out. l'm going. Did you find Gauri? No uncle, we looked around the whole village, but couldn't find him. You eat your dinner, uncle. You have gone hungry all day. My hunger has left with Gauri. Then why did you have to throw me out of the house? First you throw me out of the house, then you cry over me. Why simply create a scene? - All right, now that you are back... have mercy on us. Come inside and eat. l don't want to eat! My stomach is full after hearing his abuses. All right, pardon him, he will never scold you again. Look, uncle is full of remorse. Uncle... - That is what l don't like about you l haven't eaten, but you haven't even ensured that my father has eaten. l am a young man, l can bear hunger. You should at least have served my father. See how sullen he looks. Let us go and eat, father. l haven't seen this kind of love anywhere. l have no one but Gauri. l was small when l got separated from my mother and twin brother. And then one day, even Gauri's mother died. Now there is just me and Gauri. And so that our love isn'tjinxed, l put a black spot on Gauri's cheek. Uncle, don't worry. l have managed to woo him a little. l'll take care of the rest. Bravo! l love you, Bajrangi. l think the job has been done. Sir, Munnu has escaped from the lock up. What! That means you helped the man who is accused of murder escape? lnspector Pyare Mohan, you have been bribed. Have l...? - But remember, if he's not caught... you will spend all your life in jail. Jail! Stay there, l'm coming. - l understand, sir. You are coming here and l'm running away. Hello... The swine! You have become useless, DCP! You could not kill an ordinary guy? He has managed to escape from your custody! You have corrupt men like you in the police. He is not corrupt, only foolish. l kept him on duty so that our work becomes easier. You should have killed him then itself, but you... You planned to get him killed in the lock up... so that no one suspects you. The scoundrel has escaped. Find him! He is too dangerous for us. Our planning of several years can come to naught. Who is it? Pyare! Where did you come from? Through the window? You sneak into my house in the middle of the night like thieves? What for? Your son has shut all doors for me, so l had to come through the window. l cannot even go home, the police is standing guard even there. Your son has ruined me completely. But what has my grandson done? l forgot again. - You were talking about my son. Oh yes! He escaped from the lock up. What! - Yes. l informed the DCP. Now the DCP is accusing me of accepting a bribe. Sir, the Deputy Commissioner is here. - The DCP! l've had it. Hush! Control yourself. l'll take care of him. What's going on? Why is the police parading in my house? Because your son has escaped from the lock up. But how? Because of the foolish inspector Pyare, who is also your friend. Now even he is an offender, and we're looking for him along with your son. What happened? - l'm drowsy, my eyes ache. Have coffee, sir. - This ass will be caught! Who is an ass? - Who did you call an ass? My friend. He acts so foolish, he will be caught one day. What are you doing here? We don't want coffee, leave! l'm telling you, l'm alone at home. - Sir, there is no one here. l told you. Sir, can you come aside please? My son has not done anything, he plays such pranks to trouble me. Do something to stop the police from chasing him. l'll pay you the price you name. - What nonsense? l don't take bribes. - You don't? Surprising. Your face makes one assume you do. What? - Forget that. Sir, my son is innocent... - Your son is not innocent. He is a very big offender of law. lt is better that he surrenders himself to the police soonest... or he will regret it. Listen! You two will keep a round the clock watch on this house. He will surely come to meet his father one day. And as soon as he comes, inform me. Have patience, Munnu. God willing, everything will be all right. Nothing will be all right. The goons who can trap me in a murder case... those who can barge into the police station and try to kill me... wonder what those cruel men must have done to my brother. l don't even know if Bunnu is alive or... l don't know what to do. Where do l look for those criminals? How do l find out how Bunnu is? There is one place where we can catch them. You said they are going to put an impostor in CM's place in hospital. lf we go there, we can catch them. We can even save the CM. He has come to examine the CM on our personal request. l see. Pradhan, take him along. - Come, sir. Pradhan, there is a call for you. What are you saying, Munnu? - Believe me, Mr.Vinod. They are going to plant an impostor in place of the CM in the hospital. Some of the hospital staff is also involved. Hurry! Let him in Something terrible has been planned in this hospital. You all please go out. You tell him, l'll close the door. Do you recognise me, sir? l'm Munnu. l know who killed your wife and son. They are very dangerous. Even my brother Bunnu is in their custody. And the most important thing is that... using plastic surgery they've made one of their men to look just like you They want to substitute you. Munnu, you were a bit late in coming here. The CM has already been changed. Sir, you can arrest me if you like... but please believe me, that rogue is the fake CM. l know that the CM is fake. You scoundrels! Why have you'll brought me here? What do you want? You'll be told everything when the time comes. Take him away! Make the security more tight, no one should manage to come here. You? l'd told you not to try to meet me. That l will contact you myself when the time comes. Didn't l tell you? When will the time come? After my brother dies behind the bars? He is being tortured more and more every day. He is not being allowed to sleep all night. His condition is terrible. l don't understand what you all are doing since so many days. lt is not child's play to get your brother out of jail. lt'll take time. Half ourjob has been done. The CM is in our custody... and our man Sarang put in his place. Very soon, Sarang will get discharged from hospital... and take the CM's charge. Your brother will then be a free man. We'll have no problem. There is one problem. That boy. He has escaped your hands twice. He may become the reason for your death the third time. No one can cause my death! Until now, he was after us, but now, we will go after him. The moment we have him, we will send him where we sent his brother. Mother, don't worry. l am sure Bunnu will come to no harm. Even l think so. - Nothing untoward will happen. l have an idea which will bring Bunnu back from wherever he is. Have a look, uncle. We will publish this matter in the newspaper. ''Dear Bunnu, your grandma is very worried about you.'' ''Your father has also taken ill.'' - God forbid! That's written only for effect. ''Wherever you are, please come back. No questions will be asked.'' l will even thrash him! ''One who brings this man on the address given below,...'' ''will be given a reward of 50,000.'' He will come back only if he is alive! Munnu! My brother! Laxmi, he has regained consciousness. - Really? Are you all right now? - How did l come here? l brought you here. You were floating unconscious in the sea. The bullet just grazed your arm. l have bandaged it. Why did you get shot? - Why did you get shot? Shot...? What will you do with an expensive chain and watch after death? You want to wear my watch and chain? Wear my shirt too. Wear it. l said wear it! Wear it or l'll pump all the six bullets into you. Now run! Run! You are very lucky. You have got a new lease of life. And this happened only because of you. l will never forget this favour. l'll be going now. - Eat something and go. No thanks. l wonder what state my family is in with no news on me. l have to reach Bombay as soon as possible. You look so pleased... like as if we were going to Bombay not for Birju's marriage, but ours. Then... You sleep, brother. Birju is my only childhood friend. Won't l be pleased? Besides, l'm going to Bombay for the first time. That's all right, but the station is nearing and we are hungry. Look! How much for a samosa? - One buck. Pack ten of them. Look. - The face is exactly the same. But he's not the man. - This man looks like a village guy. He is a village guy. We'll only cut his pigtail and collect the reward of Rs.50,000. What do you think? - lt's a great idea. Hello! Which village are you from? Me? l'm from Handiya. - That is why you look so handsome. You are carrying ten samosas, that too, each costing five! Each cost only one buck. You must be joking. He gives us one for five bucks. Oh really?... You do look foolish, that is why he cheated you. Why don't you give us one for 2:50? Sure! That means l'll make a profit of 1 :50 on each samosa. Give me all of them and calculate how much l should pay you. 2:50 for one, that makes 5 for two. 7:50 for three, and for four, it's... What happened? - My train has left! Someone stop the train! - Gauri is left behind at the station. Do something! Why are you crying? We will take you to Bombay. What will l do in Bombay? l don't even have Birju's address. There is an ascetic here who can help you. Don't worry, l will give you your friend's address. Close your eyes for ten minutes and you'll see your friend's face. Why are you touching my hair? - Don't talk. lf you break your concentration, you won't find your friend. What say? - All right. Now open your eyes and tell me what you see. Who is this? - The younger brother! What say? You did this to me? How about this? And this? Where are you going? How did you like it? l lost everything in this city. My father, my moustache, my pigtail, everything. And my... Chandramukhi! Now where do l go, what do l do? Where do l get Birju's address from? Who are you? - Where had you gone, Bunnu? l'm not Bunnu. Why are you forcing yourself on me? Stop your pranks! Do you know how worried your family is about you? l am worried. Why should they be? But how do you know my family? He's acting again. Look Bunnu... - Who Bunnu? My name is Gauri Shanker l'm looking for my friend Birju's house. Birju's house? We'll take you there. You should've told us that before. - You know where he lives? Yes. - Really? Yes. Get in the car. - Birju, l'm coming! Who is this Birju? Why are you'll bothering me? l'm telling you since so long, but you refuse to listen. Please make him understand, he is my fiance but he refuses to come with us. She is your fiancee, go with her! But... - Go on. Go in! - Be a little soft, lady. Have you brought me to my friend's house or to some jail? O my my! Such a big house. Whose house is this? lt is your father's house. - Oh come on. My hut in Handiya is no comparison to this palace. l think Birju has become a thief after coming to the city. Because such a big house can only be made with that kind of money. Birju! Where are you? Come here. You're back, son! Father! What are you doing! Do you know how much l've suffered after being separated from you? Sons like you who want to punish their father should suffer such fate. l sometimes feel like breaking your head. But then... Now why are you going around me? Father, what happened to you after coming to this city? Your style of talking, your clothes, everything about you has changed. Did someone chop your pigtail off? Look, even mine was chopped off. Who cut it? - Pigtail...? Yes, who cut it? - What is he talking? He has been troubling us like that all the way here. At least he recognised you, but he refused even to recognise us. What nonsense are you talking? How will l not recognise my father? Bunnu... - Bunnu? Who is this Bunnu, father? l'm Bunnu. - Then why are they troubling me? Tell them l'm Gauri Shanker. - Gauri Shanker? Yes. - Look, Gauri Shanker... stop your act or l'll beat you to pulp. ls that clear? Yes it is. l know now. You are not my father. You are someone else. l'm not your father? - No! l am someone else who looks like him? - Yes! Did you hear that, mother? - My dear grandson! My Bunnu! l'm not Bunnu, my name is Gauri Shanker. Everyone in this house calls me Bunnu and hugs me. Oh yes! l have heard that people in the city hug you and pick your pocket Old woman, did you pick my pocket? Show me your hand. How dare you call your grandma a thief! You know it is his habit to pull pranks. Tell us, where were you until now? ln Handiya. - What were you doing there, you ass? Shut up! - You keep abusing and beating me. You better behave nicely with me. l see. Just get my boxing gloves. l want to behave nicely with him. Don't you dare beat him near me. Until l don't beat him, he doesn't behave himself. Old man, l thought you were my father and took your beatings. But now if you annoy me, l will beat you to pulp. Really? - Yes. You'll beat me? - Yes. You have angered me! No, Bunnu. - Will you stab your father? Leave my hand, let me eat the apple. l'm hungry since morning. Moreover, these women brought me here. No one even offered me a glass of water. Then he started beating me, so l got angry. Or can l ever beat a man who looks like my father? Bunnu, you have gone mad. Hasmukh, l think someone has cast an evil spell on our child. He has gone mad, or maybe he has lost his memory. Sir, this is Jaichand. We have a problem. The boy we had killed is alive. - What! He's alive? Yes, sir. But he has lost his memory. lf you say, we will kill him. No, until he recovers his memory, he will not pose a danger to us. But keep a constant watch on him. On hearing that Bunnu is alive... his brother will surely come to meet him. Thereafter, kill them both. Why are you doing this? Murderers! What will you get by killing people? What are you trying to achieve? Since we have brought you here, you are asking us this question. l'll tell you today what we want, because we will achieve it tomorrow. The Natwar Shah you have kept under tight security... will be rescued at sharp 11 . Then, at 11:45, he will leave the country forever. Shocked, aren't you? The man who is sitting in your chair as the CM... will do this very easily. And then, you will have to answer to the citizens of the country... about what you did with Natwar. - You rogue! Hello! Sir, you have been fatally attacked twice. Can you tell us who is responsible for these attacks? Terrorism is on the rise in the country. And then you are aware that l am infamous for my integrity. l think a terrorist group is responsible for these attacks. lt is also possible that Natwar Shah is behind this. lt is possible. But l'm not the one to compromise out of fear for my life The Natwar Shah issue will be tackled soon. Sir, you lost your wife and son in that attack. Can you tell us... - Please no further question. We need some loan from the government for an orphanage. lf you sign this form, our task will become easier. l had no choice but to come, Sarang. l didn't phone because it is possible that your phone is tapped. We have made all the arrangements. Tejeshwar has said that you free Natwar at sharp 11 ... and reach the same place. lf you are also ready with the arrangements,... put your fake signature on this. Tell me where my brother is! Where's my brother? Stop! No!... Leave me! Uncle, let me go. That woman... - l will not hear anything you say. Or you will take advantage of my forgetfulness and escape again. Take me where you like, but read this first. l will not read anything. First come to the police station. Please read it uncle, please! You made all my efforts go waste or l would know today where Bunnu is. Really? - Yes. Don't worry, inspector Pyare Mohan is with you. How many times do l say that l'm not Bunnu, l'm not your son. l beg of you, just once say that you are my son... so that the warrant against Munnu gets cancelled. No. - Stop being angry. lt was a heated moment when your father said that you are not his son. l promise you he will never throw you out of the house again. That is what l want. Throw me out of the house. And ask him to be angry, because he speaks the truth when he's angry. l am not his son! - l will not take his nonsense! l will thrash him! - You go from here. Why will you beat me? l haven't robbed anything. Calm down, don't get annoyed. - All right, l'm calm now. Why are you behaving like this? Why are you punishing us for your father? What have we done? Why are you punishing us? Do you know how we feel? How we spent each day since you left? Do you realise that? You don't care about anyone's sorrow, anyone's pain. You only care about yourself. You don't care about anyone else, do you? l care about anyone who is in trouble... but since l am myself in trouble, how can l help you? Please don't cry. lf you cry, even l will start crying. Seeing you cry, l am reminded of Chandramukhi. She must be so worried about me. Chandramukhi! Eat something. - l don't want it! l won't die if l remain hungry for two days. But if you keep me tied here, a lot of people will get killed. Whether anyone dies or not, but if you continue to behave like this... l will surely die. Why are you so angry? When l put my dog after you, you used to run around the whole village. Dog...? - Yes. Try and recollect. Once you had fallen through my roof. A snake had got into your dhoti. Remember how you had laughed then? - A snake had got into my dhoti? And l was laughing? Look, l beg of you, if l have done something wrong, forgive me... but don't hurt me like that. l cannot bear it anymore, Gauri. How much more do l tolerate? lt is me who is tied, who is suffering,... and you say how much should you tolerate? Chandramukhi... untie my hands so that l can eat. You will eat? - Yes. You won't run away? - No. But first untie my hands. Don't bother, l will eat myself. Will you stand and stare at me? Go and get me some water. No Gauri, l will not let you go. - Out of my way! Uncle, grandma! Bunnu has recovered his memory! Bunnu, my son! - Daddy! Are you all right? - Just recovered. You have recovered? - Yes. How much you troubled your grandma! Now please remove this dhoti. - What are you doing? Did Bunnu roam about nude? - Stop joking. Wear your own clothes so that we can meet the Commissioner... and get Munnu out of trouble. - All right. Once l get out of this house, all problems will be over. Those who have put me in trouble will now be in trouble. What kind of a man is he? The skin of my hands has peeled off, but he refuses to say anything. He will talk! He'll tell us everything. You were asking him until now. Now l will ask him in my police style. Tell me quickly. l have forgotten what l have to ask you. We have to ask him where the CM is. Uncle, my brother is alive. Look! Get in! Just drive the car! Hurry, let's go! Come on uncle, hurry! Follow that car. Come on, fast! Faster, uncle. - Don't worry! No one can beat me at driving. - Hold the steering wheel! Turn left. - l cannot see anything. Are you blind? Munnu, my brother! How are you? Do you know how desperate l have been to meet you? Why are you so perturbed? - lf you are here, who was he? Whom are you talking about? - He was with Hasmukh... he looked just like you. l still cannot believe he was someone else. That means he was Gauri Shanker. - Who is he? The one because of whom l am confined here. Where is he? They have kidnapped him assuming him to be you. The same people who attacked the CM. The whole family is in their custody. - What! We have found out where they have hid the CM. l think they must have taken your family there only. So what're we waiting for? Let's go! - Come on. Gauri! Where are you taking my Gauri? Someone stop them! Gauri, wait! Uncle, Gauri... - What happened? Stop them. - Who? They kidnapped Gauri. Why did l kill him? The memory lapse again! Listen, where am l? What happened? - What are you doing? We have come to release everybody, and you are roaming around freely? Damn! l'd forgotten again. - You almost killed us! Sir, please leave this place immediately. Hello! l'm inspector Pyare Mohan. l brought them here to release you. The scoundrels have kidnapped our family, sir. Don't worry. God willing, they will come to no harm. How fast can you drive a car? Faster, Munnu. lf my look a like reaches there... he will escape with Natwar Shah. Come, sir. Officer, Natwar Shah has to be shifted to Delhi immediately. Why, sir? - Because CBl has information... that his life is in danger. That some of the security here has been bribed. Where did Natwar Shah go? Where can you take him Mr.Sarang? You haven't come to release him, but to get caught yourself. Look there. Sarang, the law will punish you for your crimes. But for the suffering you have caused Bunnu and Munnu... they will punish you themselves. Stop them, their family is in our custody. They will be killed, so better stop them. These two have done me great favours. l will save their family even if l have to put my life at stake for it. Now l will take Natwar Shah to your accomplices. But they will think l am Sarang. Hey, listen! What's going on here? Two boys got the CM released and took him away. Let them come. Diana, we have a problem. lt is possible that the one who is coming is Sarang. And it is also possible that he is the real CM. What are you doing, Tejeshwar? Don't worry Natwar, this is an old game of ours. lsn't it, Sarang? - Yes... yes. You have done a great job, no one even suspected anything. Why would anyone suspect? Don't l look like the real CM? Since your plastic surgery, forget the others... even we cannot recognise whether you are Sarang or the CM. Since you have become the CM, you haven't murdered anybody. Your hands must be craving for it. Kill them all. You will not be able to shoot, chief minister! l've got stuck between these goons. l knew the Lord will help us. Sir, lnspector Pyare Mohan reporting Sir. You forgot again. - What? That the DCP is their man. - When will l get over this habit? Stop! Brother, hurry! - Coming. Brother, hurry! How long you took. - Come on captain. Hurry up. Don't spare him! Even l have come here to beat him to pulp. Father! - Gauri! Maybe you've forgotten. l told you that until you give an account... of every penny of the people's money, l won't even let you die. Yes, Gauri Shanker. You beat me so much. Sorry sir, but however foolish honesty may be... it does earn recognition one day. And however smart immorality is, it has to go behind bars one day. Come, sir. Move it! Mother, my fake coins have worked wonders. They used to buy fake medals. But today they've earned their medals Now you realise? Whose grandsons are they, after all? Yours, Mother. Rascals! - Yes? Put in a word for me too, even l worked hard with you. lnspector Pyare Mohan, l heard that. You have been promoted as Commissioner of police. Congratulations! Anuradha, l've been dying to tell you something. What do you want to tell? Who will be the one to sacrifice among us?
