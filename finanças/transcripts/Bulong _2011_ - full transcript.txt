I'll go get one right now. -Careful with that. -Thank you. -Doc, is this yours? -Thank you. Excuse me, some of us are busy here, you know. -Conan? -Yes? Why are you doing Jay's work? He's in Manila. I'll handle this. Can you get me a bottle of dextrose from the stockroom. Please? Sure, anything for you. There it is. Let me help you-- Here's my gift for you, Ellen. Sorry it's not gift-wrapped. You're so nice. You're really an angel, Conan. Well, what about you? What gift do you want? You know that you're the best gift I could ever have. How come you do favors for Ellen? I can also do favors for you too. I obey all your requests and orders. But with me, you wear a frown. No, I don't. Have you eaten? Not yet. I want something to boost my appetite. Do you want to join me? Dream on! But I've already eaten. Can you just buy me apple juice? -It's on me. -I want calamansi soda. That costs 20 bucks. Thanks! Next time, it's gonna be my treat. Sure! Why do you have ash on your forehead? It's from Floy. Paging Father Reyes, Father Reyes, please run to Room 236, go! What's happening? -Are you okay? -Yes. -Check what's going on inside. -Okay, I'll handle it. What's happening to you? Conan, open this door! Conan, what's going on there? Doc, help us! Help my daughter! Doc, please! I'm begging you! Help my daughter! Oh, my God! Please! Help her! Help her! -We need to call a priest! -No! Do something! Help my daughter! Please! I'm begging you. There goes the wasabi juice again. Mom, what happened to her? Sister! The funeral home will take care of her. We had her fortune told last week. According to the fortune-teller, she will leave for abroad. She was confined because of asthma. What happened, Doc? Why did she die, Doc? Why didn't you save her, Doc? Why did you let her die, Doc? -Ma'am. -Doc! I'm not a doctor. I'll take you to the x-ray room now. Don't worry, I'll take care of you. -Okay. -Just give me the knife. If the bar manager looks for it, you'll all get it from me. Come here. Just stay at the corner. We cannot fix your boyfriend's wound-- He's not my boyfriend. He's my customer, and he owes me money. Just stay here. Conan, be careful! Conan. Hey, Conan, I know it's you! I know it's you! Oprah! We're good, right? That was a long time ago. I have already forgotten your mistakes. Why are you still here? Can you put that down first? I got swindled by the recruiter. It was rotten luck. Me too. Had my share of bad luck. In fact, I was the one who brought the customer here to avoid trouble. You returned to the bar? No wonder you look like that. -You have a problem with it? -You look pretty. -I'll go ahead. -Wait a minute. If you want, you can hitch a ride with our X-ray technician. His shift just ended. I can go home alone. If my customer gets out alive, just give this to him. -What's this? -That's his bill. That idiot had seven bottles of beer and five plates of cracklings. -Make sure he pays, Conan. -Yes. Okay? Keep that. Don't lose that or else. Conan! Come here. -Where is--? -No, I don't want to. Come here, let's get you X-rayed. No, I don't want to. Come here. Come here, let's get you X-rayed. Why don't you know what happened? I hurt my eye. But I saw the patient in pain. The patient suddenly levitated! She was two feet off the ground. I even tried to stop her from floating. That's not a factual report. Why were you inside that room? I followed Ellen. You should have called a doctor. You shouldn't go near a patient. I'm sorry, Doc. You have yet to prove yourself here. Take it easy, Conan. Here you go, cousin. -There you go. -Wow, that smells good. Now let's put some cheese on it. I'm sure Ellen will want more of this. -Place it there. -I will! Yes! -Be careful with it. -Excuse me. -Yes, what can I get you? -That one! -We have here some star bread. -No. We also have animal-shaped bread here. -We have a turtle, and a croc. -But I want that one. -How about a roast pig one? -No, I want some brioche. But it's already sold. Fine, just give me five pieces of star bread. Good choice. That's our specialty here in Bulacan. Yes! By the way, I saw Oprah in the hospital last night. Really? I'm glad she's back. You know what? That girl is in love with you. We're better off as friends. I like Ellen. Yeah, right. -Hey! -Hey! You're wasting my Turkish flour. I didn't order you to make brioche. Auntie, I had that made. I'll pay for it. I'll sell it to my colleagues. Then I will give you my earnings. That's right. Don't you play me for a fool. You're lucky I'm a good aunt. I took both of you in. Take care of my bakery. I'll just attend to our property in Manila. Wait, Auntie. Are you okay with this size? You fool. That's too big. Flour is expensive. Make that smaller. Don't waste the bread. If it gets molds, make them into pudding. If no one buys your pudding, sell it to the piggery. -I'll go ahead. -Okay. -Bye. -Put it back. Buy 10 pieces of antibiotics. -Give this to Ellen. -Okay. Then take it two times a day, every eight hours. Thank you. -Come here. -Someone might see us. Dr. Randy! Thank you. Here you go, Floy. I know you're hungry. -Have some more. -You can have that. -This tastes good. -Ellen. Yes? That's for you only. Thanks! You know I'm avoiding carbs. But I already ate one. Can we talk? -We're already talking. -In private. What do you mean? Let's be honest to each other and tell me the truth. What's my status? Excuse me? I saw you with Dr. Randy. What about us? There's no us. Are you breaking up with me? We're not breaking up, because we were never together. Sorry. I thought this was a bar? Why does it look like a parlor? -We're done. -Thanks, Oprah. Thank you. I can get my hair fixed here. Hi. -When did this become a parlor? -It's a miracle, you're here. -Thank you. -Your patient survived. -Here's his payment. -Thanks! Do you know of any bar we can go to? We want to drink. You're in the right place. Just relax. It's Happy Hour time. Wow. Here you go. Your beer. -Here's your order. -Thanks, Oprah. Thanks, girl. A plate of pan-roasted pork, please. -French fries? -Pan-roasted pork. I said French fries. Miss, Miss, an order of sisig, please. French fries! I will fly to the end of the world I will do anything for you Because you're my-- Super hero There's a solution to that. Ellen will crawl back to you. She's just playing hard to get. She's probably just testing me. Her feelings for me can't just fade away. -Oprah. -What? Isn't your aunt a fortune-teller? I want to consult her. Take me to her. You need my aunt now? Stop pestering me, Conan. I have enough annoying customers. Stop bothering me. There is one sure way for you to get Ellen. Do you have a love potion? No. You just need to whisper. But I already tried whispering my love to her. I even tried shouting it at her. Nothing happened. Look, if you really want to make her yours, you will need to whisper your wish to the dead. You're talking about the dead. How can you whisper to someone who's already dead? It won't hear you anymore. That's what the elders from our place say. Many have already tried it. It never fails. When you whisper your wish to the dead, its spirit will hear you and it will act as your genie. The dead will fulfill your wish before it crosses over to the other side. Dra. Bilbao, please proceed to the Delivery Room. Dra Bilbao, to the Delivery Room, please. What happened? Is she dead? -I'm still alive. Why? -Congratulations! -What time is my operation? -Hysterectomy, 3 p.m. You moron! I still have my uterus and you're already philandering. I'm sorry. Forgive me. -She's gone! -Ma'am, calm down. My niece is gone! God help me! Time of death, 4:05 p.m. First dead body for the day. How come your head is so heavy? I say she's a three. What a loser! You like rating the dead. You should work at a funeral parlor. But there's no life in a place like that. Ronald, the supplies are here. The guys from the E.R. might beat us to it. Okay, let's go then. Come on! Go ahead. -What are you gonna do here? -I'll pray for her. -Are you planning to-- -I'm not crazy like you. Suit yourself. I wish Ellen would love-- She's alive! She's alive! Thanks to you, my niece woke up. -You're a blessing! -You're a hero. Fine, I'm a hero. Good work, Mr. Obaryo. We will immediately report your heroism to the local Health Department. Conan, aren't you going home yet? Enough with your drinking. -Do you have a problem? -Yes. Then handle it. I'll sleep here. You lunatic. This is not a hotel. Go home. Go home, Conan. I have to go somewhere. It's late. Where are you going? To a wake. A wake? The former caretaker of this parlor died yesterday. Do you believe in whispering? -Whispering to the dead? -Yes. My fortune-teller aunt does. -Can I go with you to the wake? What are you going to wish for? Over there. Stop fooling around. Hurry! Hey mister, who are you with? -What are you doing here? -Who is this girl? Answer me! -I'm his wife Annabel. -No, you're not. I'm the wife. That's not true. He married me. You're the mistress. No, I'm not. You're the mistress! I wish Ellen would love me. What's wrong, sir? What are you doing? Conan makes medicolegal reports. He needs to thoroughly check if the embalming process was done properly. That's true. I need to look at her face closely. But it looked like you were talking to her. You need to blow air on her face. If her cheeks change color, then it means they used pure formalin. -Is it pure? -Very pure. -I think it worked. -How do you feel? I seem to have gotten my strength and confidence back since I whispered to the dead. It feels like electricity is coursing through my veins. That's it! Just grab Ellen and kiss her. I'm sure she'll be yours forever. -Hi, Conan. -Yes. -Hi, Conan. -Hello. -You look cute today. -Thanks! -Hi, handsome. -Hi. Yes, Doc. Bye. What's that? Ellen, Ellen. -Conan, what's gotten into you! -Why are you still like that? Why? What did you expect? Maybe I need to kiss you again-- -Ouch! -Pervert! What happened? I whispered my wish loudly and clearly. -You made me look like a fool! -But it's true! I whispered to the dead, but look what happened. Why did Ellen get mad? Maybe it's like a post-dated check. You need to wait for a few days for it to take effect. -Will you two quit it? -My wish was clear. I asked that Ellen love me now! But what happened? She hit you. Conan, aren't you going to shut up? You're acting like that just because of a girl! And you! You urged me to whisper to that corpse. I looked like a moron. Let me go. Even if you keep on talking to that dead body, nothing will happen. It will not take effect because before she died, she got sick. -What do you mean? -She turned deaf! So you mean even her spirit is deaf? I don't know. How can I be sure of that? -Move aside. -It's true. You cannot whisper your wish to a deaf corpse. It needs a spiritualist. -Spiritualist? -Yes. Why are you telling me only now? I didn't know. My friend told me about it after you whispered to the dead. -Hey, don't! Not here! -You're gross. Here. Not there! I will have a hard time cleaning that up. Just swallow it. Let me go. You two, you are useless. You're both liars! Hey! I'm not a liar. Call me stupid, a moron, a snake but I'm not a liar. You're making fun of me. When you had problems with your former boyfriend, who helped you? I did. What are you trying to say? Did I not help you with anything? If I'm your best friend, you will respect my feelings. -You won't make fun of me. -What do you want me to do? Go through everything I've done for you? Don't bother. I know you too well. Cousin, wait! Hey, wait! You can't leave. You haven't paid your bill yet. Hand me the money. Are you okay? -Are you okay? -I'm fine. -Are you sure? -Yes. Next time, don't drink too much. Hey, stop! Grandma? Grandma? Help! Anyone, help us! Grandma, are you dead? Forgive me, but please hear my plea. Let Ellen love me. -Are these all? -Yes, sir. -Okay, let him in. -Yes, sir. Boss, come with me. Are you sure you didn't see the plate number? No, the car sped away. Are you drunk? I don't drink. I'm allergic to alcohol. No ID. What are you going to do with her things? We'll keep it. We might find a lead to identify and locate her relatives. Are you sure she's dead? The body is badly crushed. She's dead for sure. Good! Good? Good luck. Goodbye! Good night! Simon, Simon! I saw an old lady get hit by a car! She's dead. I wasn't able to help her, but I whispered in her ear. Simon. -You owe me! -I'll pay you. I heard that before. You think my wish is effective? Wake up. Dr. Ramirez, please proceed to the Operating Room. Dr. Ramirez, to the Operating Room, please. Conan? Conan, sorry about yesterday. I felt like a dirty stray dog, that was kicked around before being turned into stew. And that was a really sweet dog. I'm sorry. You hurt me, Ellen. It's like you opened my chest then grabbed my heart without anesthesia. I'm really sorry. I'll treat you to lunch later. You cheater! Go back to her, liar! Conan! -He's a moron. -What happened? Take me home. Good night, Ellen. Good night, Conan. I'm going to sleep now. So tomorrow I will look fresh for you. I love you, Ellen. Conan. Fresh bread! Simon? Hey, Simon? I was only gone for a few days and this happened to him. -What happened? -Maybe he was cursed by a witch. What? What? He pees and spits everywhere. I'll take him home to his parents. They might blame me for what happened to their son. Do you want me to take him to our hospital? I can take care of him there. In your hospital where lots of people die? No way. The witch doctors in their town can heal him. Careful, Simon. Watch your head. Ouch! Leave me alone! Ouch! Here's my fare. -Did you see that? -See what? Conan? Why didn't you fetch me? We didn't have plans, did we? -Are you my boyfriend or not? -Boyfriend? If you're my boyfriend, you have to fetch me all the time! -Are you mad at me? -No, I'm not. But it should be clear to you that in this relationship, I am the boss. Let's go. -Ellen, someone's here. -That's a corpse. -Come here. -Wait, I don't like this. -Are you backing out? -No. Of course not. Excuse me. Passing through. I didn't know you're superstitious, Conan. Wait. Stop it! This is not what I want. Is this what you want? I'm giving Ellen to you. She's all yours! Just leave Paula's soul alone! Leave her alone! Stop this, Ellen. You're not Ellen. You're possessed! Stop, please! Forgive me, Ellen. I didn't ask for this. I take it back! I take my wish back! Please forgive me, Ellen. Ellen, please wake up. Please. Ellen. Come on, fight! Oh, my God. What is this! Conan, what did you do to her? Nothing. I didn't do anything. She's the one who... You're dead! Wait, Doc. I didn't do anything. You'll regret this. Call Security. -We don't have Security anymore. -The agency pulled it out. Then call the police! -Hurry! -Doc, let me explain. Ellen? -Ellen, what happened to you? -Ellen. Honey? Love? Babe? Lord, what have I done. All I wanted was to have a girl I could love. I just whispered my wish to the dead so you can hear my heart's plea. I pray... Grandma, is that you again? Please leave me alone. I just came back to get my things. There you go. So you're easy to talk to. Grandma! Thank you! Thank you for fulfilling my wish! But take it back if you want. Just please leave me in peace. Are you talking about an important date? Here's my stop. Give me a beer. Thanks. Oprah? Oprah. I thought I'm a useless friend? I'm sorry. I just had a little too much to drink. Whispering to the dead is effective. But it has a trade-off. What trade-off? The ghost I whispered to is haunting me. Is that a side effect? How would I know? Maybe it's asking for something in return. But what can I give her aside from prayers? Do they accept gift checks? Oprah, please, can I sleep here tonight? Conan, you can't. I'm spending the night at my aunt's house. Why don't you stay in a hotel? Or sleep on the streets. I have an idea. Why don't you go to a wake? Pretend that you're a friend or a relative of the deceased. You can get free coffee there. My God! It's her! Conan, leave. You're being followed. -Please go away, Conan. -I cannot leave this place. Just go away. I came here to ask for your help. It hurts people! Why me? Conan go away. She's inside. Please have pity. Where's my calculator? Oh, my God. Rhum, 750. Tequila, 800. 400. Rhum again. 750. Hang on! You're items are overpriced. That's why you have to leave this place now. Get out of here, Conan! You'll wipe me out! -Go, leave! -Fine, I'll go. You're not acting like a friend. You're like a businesswoman. Grandma! Was that the mirror? 4,600! My boss will fire me, for sure! Conan! "Bulol"? Idiot! One month suspension. You're lucky you just got a month. But, Ma'am, what about Ellen? She was given a forced vacation leave. Sometimes, she still spaces out. Conan. Paging Dra. Aquino, please proceed to the Emergency Room. Excuse me. Wait here, you still have to sign some papers. Conan, I'm not an expert. I know only a few tricks. But I'm sure you learned something from your aunt. Are you just settling on me because I'm much cheaper? Of course not! I trust you. You're my friend. Okay, I'm just reminding you that I don't know how to push ghosts away. That's not what I'm here for. This looks like something important. It suddenly appeared in front of me. Wait, you haven't paid me yet. Money down. I'm not going anywhere. I'll pay you. -Are you going to pay me or not? -Fine. Here. Where did that come from? Conan, I don't think I can help you with this. This isn't for the PBA like me. This is for the NBA league. Really? -Why did you hurt Oprah before? -That was a long time ago. And it's my fault, I was making fun of his crush Chelsey. -But we're now friends again. -Why are you here? Why don't you guess? For Oprah's sake, I'll let that slide. No, Aunt Kara, Conan here needs your help with something. -With what? -What is this? What happened to her? Does she have high blood? Low blood? Diabetes? Or stroke Don't worry about it. It happens to her every night. So we're not going to do anything? She'll wake up tomorrow morning. Well, what about my problem? Talk to her tomorrow. You can sleep here tonight. -Where? -Here in my bedroom. There's the bed. -Let's go. -We'll sleep together? Dream on. You'll stay here. I'll sleep beside Aunt Kara. I feel safe here. Our house is protected from evil spirits. Rest well. Finally, I will enjoy having a peaceful night-- -Are you gay? -I'm just gonna get my wallet. You might steal from me. Don't you want me to sleep with you? I'm used to sleeping on the floor. Stay inside. Good night. Just knock when you wake up. Can we leave the door ajar, so I can keep an eye on you and be sure you're safe. No. -She's gone? -You know her? There were no signs or warnings. -Impossible. -Who is she? Did the old lady who owned this have a cloth bag? How did you know? It's her. It's Paula. -Is she your friend? -She's the... She's the who? The last time I saw her, she was burning her witchcraft paraphernalia to destroy the dark world she used to live in. Her decision to leave witchcraft started from one of my clients. You will have a great future. You will go abroad. Thank God! What about those people who hurt me? What will happen to them? It depends on how you handle those people. Even if I go abroad, I still won't be happy. Not until I take revenge on those who have hurt me. Do you know of any witch, Madame? I gave them to Lola Paula. And they offered her the hair of the person they wanted to put a spell on. The hair is enough for the spell to take effect. But for it to become more effective, they had to return with a picture of the person they wanted to put spell on. Paula was shocked after seeing the photo. Who are these? This is Paula's daughter. And this is her grandchild. What? She put a spell on her own grandchild? And on the daughter of her grandchild! The lady who had her cursed was her rival for a man's attention, and she is now pregnant. Preggy? What is her name? -Lala. -Lala? -Lala? -Lala. Lala! -Lala. -Lala. Lala! Yes. That's what Ellen and Simon were saying when they got possessed. Lala! It was too late when Paula found out. The spell already took effect on her grandchild. That's when she decided to leave the world of witchcraft. That's it, Conan! She's haunting you because she wants you to do something for her in return. What can I do? I don't know those people. And I don't know where to find them. You have to finish Paula's task. There. That's the mom of the lady who got her cursed. Yes, that's her. I remember her. Everyone who asked for Paula's help died last week. I saw all their names in the Obituary. -It's just like a massacre. -It might be a coincidence. No, Conan. The soul of a witch is owned by the devil. And once you seek for a witch's help, your soul is already hostaged by the devil itself. That's why when Paula decided to leave the world of witchcraft, every hostaged soul was taken by the devil. Auntie, it seems many souls have been mortgaged, and we might be next. Let's leave now. No, we need to do something. Paula might stop haunting you, but now you have a fiercer evil to fight. The devil itself. That's why we need to talk to her now. Can you do it? You can punch harder than me. Look for it, or else. You thief! Fools! You're planning to steal from me. Why are you here, fake fortune-teller? This is important. You said my daughter will have a good future. But now she's dead! The girl counter-attacked the spell we put on her. That's why I need to know where they live, so I can stop whatever curse they could put on you. Look here. -Where is this place? -Bohol. Bohol? -Bohol? -Fool! What's the joke? Oh, that's why the ghost pushed me against the calendar on the wall. That's an image of Bohol. Listen, you need to bring the body of Paula to Lala. But what if we cannot get the body? If you cannot bring her body, then just get a piece of hair, or any part of her body, then put it in holy water. Then let Lala drink the holy water. That's the only way to end the curse. What's her curse? Skin disease. And her baby, to be born dead. Is she going to give birth soon? Don't forget, it's the devil we're up against. It will do anything to stop us. We are safe in this house, but outside-- You cannot expect her to help you with your problems because of her condition. Oprah, help me. No way. Help me, please. Why me? I don't know anything about that. Me too. At least you know a bit about witchcraft. Conan, I helped you with Aunt Kara. That's it. You really are a useless friend. Why? What are the different types of friends? Do you put that on the menu? Do you order it in a restaurant? Where did you put me? On drinks, appetizers, main course or dessert? Do you even have other friends? Where are they? Why am I the only one by your side? Conan, I already helped you. That's it. You're not an appetizer, you're not a dessert. You're not a main course. You are not even worthy to be included on a menu. This was your dream girl Chelsey. She dumped you because I put a spell on her. That's why she got pregnant with another guy. Now you know the truth. Why did you do it? Because I'm a worthless friend. Because I'm crazy. Now leave! Is this you? I told you to close your eyes, didn't I? Close your eyes! Stupid guy. Where's your mistress? Is this her? You're a beauty! Nice face, man. You're lucky. What are you looking at? I said close your eyes! I'll punch you on the eyes. I said close your eyes! Look at the time. Close your eyes! You're stupid. Pretending you know how to swim. You even brought your beautiful-- What did you do that for? I need your help. You're asking me for help? You know I have no connection in this hospital. Just take a break. Accept your suspension. It's not about the suspension. I need something else from you, man. I can sell this for 500. I can sell this for 100. Lord, I'm not stealing. I'm just doing this for Lola Paula's peace. Grandma, I'm already helping you out. Don't rush me. -You bastard! -Aunt Tyra! You're useless! You left the bakery and the house! I've been here since yesterday. Why did you not come home? And it looks like you're planning something with my stuff! -I'm just fixing your things. -Who are you trying to fool? Where's Simon? He's at the psychiatric hospital. Stay with him there. Leave! -Please. -You're useless. Leave! I'm not going to help you. I'm a worthless friend. Please, just one last favor. You know what? You're causing your own problems. I don't want to be a part of it anymore. -This is gonna be the last. -No way! I have put everything inside. Why is everything outside again? -Talk to her. -No way! -Just talk to her. -I don't want to. -Please. -Okay, fine. Grandma, I'm begging you. Please stop haunting me. I cannot do anything to help Conan... Please respect my-- -Just say you'll help me. -No, I won't! Please respect my decision. I won't help Conan. -Please. Stop this, please. -Why me? Have mercy on me. Oprah, just say yes. No! I said no! I won't help you, Conan. No! Oprah, please. You might get hurt. I've made my decision. No! Oprah! Just pay them. Here's the money. Two thousand bucks? Is this it? Come on, that's a huge amount of money. How about this? I'll give you all the corpse in the morgue. Exclusively yours. Just help us out on this one. Fine. Great! I love you. We'll leave you guys for a while. Where's the key? Hurry. Here. No one's there. No one is watching. Do whatever you want, but be careful. Thanks, dude. Here she is. Let me see. I pity her, no one has claimed her body yet. Yeah. Let's carry this and put it there. Do it yourself. I still hurt all over. I cannot carry it by myself. Just do it. So you won't help me? Grandma, she doesn't want to help. I'll help you. I can stand the pain. -You tattletale. -Ready? -This is heavy. -Slowly. -See, we did it. -I'm tired. This is heavy. What are we going to do to her body? We cannot just bring it outside. They might think we killed her. Donald will help us. All we have to do is bring her outside this morgue. Grandma, I'm sorry. We're here to fulfill your wish of bringing you to Bohol. Amen. Help me carry her. Conan, let's go! I don't want to be cremated alive! -We cannot leave her body here! -But she's already dead. Come on, let's not fight about this here! You're heartless. If she gets cremated here, we have failed our mission. -Let's go! -Please! Conan, hurry! -Come on! Feels like hell! -Conan! Oprah! Jump! -Where's grandma? -Let's go! No! Grandma? Conan please! Conan! -Let's go. -Wait. I just got a finger. That will work! Let's go! -Give it to me! -Wait, I'll get one more. Let's go! Where are we heading? I don't know. You've got the map. Wait. I'll ask around. Miss, how do we get here? -Where? -What did she say? -I don't know where that is. -What did she say? I don't know. -Where is this place? -Conan! My bag! -Hey, that's mine. -Mister! Hey, that's my bag! That's my bag! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you just going to walk around the city? Mister, where is this jeepney going? Where are you going? -Here. -That's far. And our jeep is the only ride that goes there. You haven't seen the map, and yet you know where we are going? You're a fortune-teller too! -Good evening, Sir, Ma'am. -Good evening. -Do you have available rooms? -Of course, we do! 550 pesos per night, air-conditioned room. Sir, are we near this place? Yes, you're near. -Just fill out this form. -I'll do it. Okay. Why is it dark? Are we the only guests here? We have two Korean guests. Maybe they went outside to walk around. This way, please. -What was that? -Nothing, it's just windy. Windy? There's not even a breeze. Windy? -Windy! -Yes, sir? Have you already sprayed air fresheners? You know the Koreans don't want that. -It's okay, go ahead. -No, you go first. -It's okay. -No, I'll use the one outside. That's where I'm going anyway. They have a bathroom outside. I'll go there. -So you're leaving me alone? -I'll be quick. -Hurry up. -Promise. -Hurry up, Conan. -Yes! I'm so tired. I wish they had a spa here. This is a bed and breakfast place. This hotel is nice. What happened to the tarsier's head? Take a picture of me. That's creepy. It's okay! This is cool! I'm so tired. I wish they had a spa in this hotel. That man is strange. Sir, let's take a picture. Conan? I already gave you the key-- Conan. Can I help you? Help me, please! -Why ma'am? -They want to kill me! Mr. Kim, Mr. Kim, she's our guest. Oprah? Oprah! Oprah... -Excuse me. -Yes? We want to get some holy water, but we have no container. Use this. Thank you. -Are we still far? -Not much. About two kilometers. Two kilometers more. Aunt Kara told us not to let our fears take over. All the devil can do is scare us. But he can't do it for one whole day because he is not that powerful. So if we don't allow him to scare us, then we win. Where's Grandma's finger? -It's safe here in my bra. -Where? Let me see. Ouch! We need to hurry. The devil is closing in on us. That's a cliff! Mister, that's a cliff! Let go of me! Oprah, jump! Conan! Conan! Conan! Conan! Conan! I thought you were a goner! I thought so too. Good thing I was able to hold on to a branch. Wait, you're so gross. You've got mud all over you. Thank you. Where's the finger? Oh no, the finger! Here it is. Thank God I didn't lose it. Oh, no, it's been pulverized. That's fine. We can mix it in the holy water then have Lala drink it. I'm sorry, Conan. I'm the one who needs to apologize. I didn't put a curse on Chelsey. She's just a flirt, that's why she got pregnant early. Conan, I don't think she's the right girl for you. The sun is about to set. Time is running out. I'm scared, Conan. What else will the devil do to stop us? We're almost there. That's why I'm scared. We are almost there. We're already here. Let's just finish this. Don't worry. We won't get separated again. -Who are you? -Wait! What do you want? We are not enemies. We are just looking for Lala. Paula's grandchild. What do you need from me? We can help you with your condition. We're sorry about Paula's death. We didn't expect her to live long after she left us. -What is your name? -Lili. Lili? Lala. Lolo. Paula is my son's mother-in-law. Lala, Lili, Lolo. All your names start with L. Paula loves you dearly. She turned away from witchcraft a long time ago. We just need you to do something, Lala. If that's from my mother, never mind! And if you're a part of her team, go away. But we can heal you, Lala. This is just a skin allergy. No, it's not. And we can even save your baby's life. What are you saying? My baby is fine. We know you had a rival for the affection of the man whose baby you're carrying. It's Coco. Who are you? You have a skin disease because your rival put a spell on you. And on your child. Who cast the spell? My mother did! She didn't mean it. Get out! You demons! Trust us. Go away, or I'll drive you away with my axe. Your baby's life is in danger. -We don't need you. Leave! -Mother! Lala? Why? It hurts. Her water broke. -Call the midwife! Hurry! -Okay, I'll fetch her. Careful, dear. The midwife is on her way. -Where's the finger? -Right! -Where did you put it? -It's in my bag. -I put it here. -Hurry, look for it. Here it is. Just a minute. I can already see it! It's coming! Conan, this is all that's left. This is all that's left of the holy water as well. Hurry, let's mix them together. Hurry, Ling-Ling. Lala, wait a little bit. Will this still work? Conan, don't give up. We can do this. Don't you think the reason the demon is not following us anymore, is because we have already failed? We have lost? Don't give up. This will work. Stop thinking negatively. Hurry, let's go. This is what you need to do. Just drink this, and the curse will end. -Yes, Lala. -What are you doing? Stop that! -Trust us. -This is the cure. -No! -Please. Just drink this. -No, I won't! -Throw that away. What did you do? Who are you? I am the bad news that's telling you that you cannot get Paula! Lala! Here is the midwife! Oh, no, the baby already came out. -What happened here? -Lili? Lili? -Where is it? Who was that? -That's not important anymore. What matters is Lala has given birth. -The baby is alive. -My grandchild! -Yes! -Where's the baby? My God. It's a boy. Lala. You have a baby boy. -We need hot water. -We need hot water. Hurry. Your baby is a boy. Your skin is cured. My God, thank you, my daughter has been healed. -Your sores are gone. -Where is he? Oprah? My grandchild is handsome. Ling-Ling, hurry up! Conan. What are you doing there? What happened to you? You're such an idiot. My God. What have you been doing? Where is the demon? -Show yourself to me! -It's gone. A baby? The baby is alive? Yes, Conan. The baby is alive. I succeeded! I succeeded! I succeeded! -Stop it. -Why? Yes, I saw how you fought hard. You were amazing there. You really did well. I'm so proud of you, Conan! You're the man! You're welcome. I'm the man! I'm the man! Oprah! Oprah! That was a close call. She's now happy. The curse has ended. She is now free from the devil's tight grip. She wants to thank you, Oprah. Please tell her she's welcome. And please tell her to never come back. She thanks you too, Conan. She will now cross over to the other side. Tell her to be careful. She might get hit by a car again. Ouch. Good morning, Conan. Welcome back. Good morning. -Hi, Doc. -Hi, Conan. -Good luck to your child. -Thank you. -Hi, Conan. How are you? -I'm good. Conan! You left your food. -You're so sweet. -I know. You even left the electric fan on. And you forgot to pull the plug of the iron. -Oh, no. -I'm just kidding. -You're such a joker. -Conan? -Conan! How are you? -Ellen, how are you? I'm back after three days of leave. I don't even know why they wanted me to take a leave. I don't remember anything. Me too. By the way, Oprah, this is Ellen. Ellen, Oprah. -Hi, Oprah. -Hello. -Is Conan a good boy? -Very much so. He always talks about you. Always you. Really? -What does he say about me? -What is that? -Payslip? -This is nothing. -Resignation letter. -You're resigning? I'm going to Dubai. I'll be leaving next month. -Good luck. -A month's a long time. Thank you. Nice meeting you, Oprah. Conan, Dr. Randy left a note for you. I'll read it later after I'm done. I'll be on my way as well. I still need to open the parlor. -Okay, thank you. -Bye. And I want to walk out with her. Wait. No, we have a lot to talk about. So you have a parlor. Yes, visit me sometime. I'll fix you up. You need it. Really? I'll drop by then. Give me a discount, okay? Paging Dr. Villar, please proceed to the Emergency Room. Oprah? Oprah! Hey, Oprah! What are you looking at? What's that? This is our date food. Egg and chicken intestines. We went all the way to Manila just for those? We have that in Bulacan! It's your favorite. It tastes better. Manila flavor. Is this different from what we have in Bulacan? Yes. Try it. -What do you think? -I haven't tasted it yet. What actor has many teeth? -Ma-teeth? -Good. Who has much more teeth? -Edgar More-teeth. -You know that as well. How about the one who only has one tooth? Who? -Vilma San-tooth. -Silly! Look, a shooting star! Let's make a wish. No way. I'm done wishing for the rest of my life. Trust me, if you wish upon a star, it will surely come true. I wish that you fulfill all your dreams because that will make me happy. Hey, there's one more. Come on, make a wish. -Hurry. Quick, Over there! -Where? It's not there anymore. It just left. You can still make a wish. No, it's not there anymore. Because it's already here with me. Here... Are you serious? My wish... is to be with you. So that I can settle down already. I only have one wish. To see-- I just want to see the body of my twin sister! -Conan! -Paula is alive! Don't leave me! Wait for me! Conan! What are you going to do with that? Are you messing it up or fixing it? Where am I going to run? Come here. Come here. We will surely tell the DOH about your... What gayness? -Now what? You can't come out? -Let me out! Open the door! Am I dying too?
