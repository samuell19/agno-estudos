TELL ME YES... TO LISA, MY DAUGHTER... Five, nine, 13, 25... She's a brunette! Fifteen, three, nine... She's a brunette. She's tall, she's thin... It's Candice! Two, 11... Damn it! One hundred thirty-eight. -What do you mean 138? -138. It's not Candice. Oh, damn it. Well, yes. You can see that there's a distance. Look. -So there's a distance like this. -But what distance? There's no distance between Candice and I. She's the love of my life. Yes, well, take it easy since it's only been the fifth week with her. That's really petty. Candice is perfect. She's... Well, she is in the dining room with Zacharyan. Do you know a lot of women who are willing to hang around all night while I get fleeced? -I want two cards, man. -Are you sure? You're taking a risk since it's not your day. Come on, deal it. -Hello? -Hello, yes. Oh! Sophie. -I'm waiting for you. -What? You've been waiting for me? -I've been waiting for three hours. -Three cards. -There you go, and you? -What are you doing? Well, no, yes... I know. I don't even have an excuse. Oh, that's very original as an excuse, right? It is unforgivable. I know. Okay. But listen, Sophie, I'm getting robbed here. No, I haven't forgotten you. What? You want me to forget you? You're the one who called me. No, of course, it's a serious decision. You were right to call me, this is important. It's Benoît, I don't know what came over him, he wants to change service. I don't get it. It's annoying. Are you in or not? Yes, yes, sorry. Hello. Are you with us or not? I'm with you, I'm with you. Hello, Sophie, can you hear me? Hello? Hello? Candice, Candice. I'll be back in a minute, excuse me. -Oh, no! -Stéphane... You don't leave a poker table like that! Candice, half an hour, okay? Well, 15 minutes, then. I beg of you, I've lost a fortune. Have a good evening, Stéphane. -Bob. -Yes? Sorry, old man, but you shouldn't be playing her game. What are you doing? You're trying to make me jealous, right? She's ridiculous. She's trying to make me jealous. Jealous, you? That's new. Candice. -Are you in or not? They're angry. -I'll be right there. Candice, two minutes, just two... Oh, damn! Don't you move, don't you move! I raise to a thousand. A thousand! One thousand. There you go. -I'm in! -I'm in too. Well, here you go, four aces. Go on and count them, there's four. I know, it's enough to become superstitious. Where is that thing from? This is from the Amazon. It's a lucky charm, you won't find it here. Let's cash out, Brice. Candice! Candice! Candice! Candice! Wait, damn it! Candice! Candice! Red light, turn red! Yeah! Red! I won, I won! I always said that you bring me luck. Well, open. Open. I'm sorry, Stéphane, it's over. Oh, no, Candice, not you, not us. You know what? We'll have a great breakfast at the Grand Hotel. We'll get suite 415, the one with the king-size bed. -Come on, say yes. -You don't get it, do you? I'm sick of you. You don't know love, you don't know pain. When you tell me "I love you," I feel like I'm hearing "sleep well." Stéphane, you're not a man, you're a Martian. Goodbye, baby. A Martian. Why not? I never thought about it, but why not? Hey, Stéphane! What are you doing? Are you in? We're waiting for you here. Come on, come. You robbed a fortune from them. They're furious. Come. This is your lucky day, you have the damn hand! You're an idiot! Damn it, you're an idiot! My lucky day, you say. You're an idiot! An idiot! It was four in the morning, I was exhausted, I drank too much, I was going home but I wasn't going anywhere. I didn't dream that my life would be like this. No, I wasn't unhappy, but I wasn't happy either. I wanted it to get going, to change. That something happens to me, something or someone. But even I wasn't expecting this. Now, I know that she wasn't there by chance. That's my shoe, sir. What are you doing here? I'm lost. -Lost? Where do you live? -Strasbourg. Strasbourg? Well, you should tell your parents. Where are they? Strasbourg. -Wait, but we're in Bordeaux. -I told you, I'm lost. Tell me how you got lost in Strasbourg and ended up in Bordeaux. -I took the train. -The train? We came here with my class for two days. We visited the chateaux. You know, tour buses, picnics... all that jazz. And when we went to the station, the train left without me. Can you believe it? -Ooh la la! -What? You seem tired. Yes, I'm tired. Have you seen the time? -Come on, we'll call your parents. -They don't have a phone. How is that possible? Everyone has a phone. Not my parents. But tomorrow morning, before taking the train, I'll call Mrs. Rivière. -Mrs. who? -Mrs. Rivière, she's the neighbor. -Well, I'll be going. -Yes, that's right, go ahead. I'm tired, I need to go sleep. -Where are you going? -I'm going to the train station. Don't talk nonsense, going to the train station all alone. Come on, you'll sleep here tonight and tomorrow morning, we'll call your neighbor, Mrs. whatever. -Rivière. -Yes, that's it, Rivière, come on. As you want. -It's really nice of you. -Unbelievable. But that's crazy. The train doesn't make a last call before it leaves? I don't know. I got off to drink a Coke and when I got back, the train was gone. Do you live alone? Come in. It's so beautiful. Ooh la la. And the view, it's awesome. -Ooh la la. -It's still a bit of a mess, but... I haven't even finished painting it. I can't decide on the colors. -You're not married? -No, why? -It's big just for yourself. -Really, you think so? Can I have some yogurt? I'm hungry. Is that okay with you? No, no, go ahead. But on the train, there'd be someone who noticed you weren't there. Yeah, my friend, Fabienne. But she won't say anything. Oh yeah? And why won't she say anything? Because she won't say anything. Anyway for my parents, I'm on the train. I'm only arriving tomorrow morning. So there's no worry. No, there's no worry. Except that you still need to call someone, right? You're obsessed with the phone. I'll get you a blanket. You'll sleep in my office. Do you want me to get you some pajamas? I'd prefer a t-shirt. Come in. That's your desk? It's old. Of course, it's my grandfather's desk. Oh, what's this? Is it an Indian hat? Yeah, from the Redskins. It's a ceremonial headdress. -And this? What's this? -These are my lucky charms. -Look, I have a lot of them. -You believe in them? You know, the Indians say, "Witches do not exist, "but when they fly, they fly." Come on, time to sleep. -I'm Éva. -I'm Stéphane. Tell me, you've played the piano before, right? Yes. -Who is it? -It's Chopin. La grande polonaise brillante. It's not easy for me since I have small hands. But no, it's the piano that's too big. You're dumb. Your chocolate is going to get cold. How do you know that I drink chocolate? That's all you had in the cupboard. Great. It's so good. Did you add something to it? It's a secret. So, we'll call Mrs. whatever. What's her name again? -Rivière. -Yes, Rivière. -Where is your phone? -There. Hello, Mrs. Rivière? It's Eva. Yes, yes, it's very nice. It's a very beautiful city. No, no. I missed the train. Can you tell my parents so they won't worry? Oh, they're not there? In Nice? They'll be back in two days? Oh, so it's better that I stay here then. -No, hold on. Pass her to me. -Okay. Pass her to me. I want to talk to her. -Thank you, Mrs. Rivière. Goodbye. -Pass her to me. What's her number? The number you have called... What is this nonsense? Are you messing with me? Where are you going? Eva. Eva, come back. Eva! Hello? What? Stéphane? Huh, huh? No way. Huh? No way. Huh? No way. Stop saying "no way." It's not a young woman, it's a little girl. That's it, she's a child prodigy like Bach or Mozart. That's right, she must've ran away. Yes, a runaway Bach. Ooh la la. Well, yes, she left. What do you want me to tell you? Last night, it was 50,000. -How much? -50,000. What? Why do you want to share? They were my four aces, right? Well, I'm in a hurry. Bye. -Hello, Monique. -Hello. I would like two croissants, please. I'll also take a dozen of the chewing gum. And six jelly tarts. Yes. Give me five francs of gummy worms. No, ten francs. There we go. Thank you, Monique. Dr. Benoit, you are wanted at reception. So children, you don't say hello anymore? Hello. -Hello, Doctor. -Mrs. Dupuis. I found chewing gum everywhere again last night. No. Chewing gum is not good for the teeth, not good at all. -I'm not kidding about this. -Well, me neither. -We must not bring them. -Well, no. Who's bringing them? -Are you making fun of me? -No. I'm not joking about this. All this junk will make them sick. I'm already sick. Léo, we don't talk with our mouth full. Yes, something very nice. That's it, a big colorful bouquet. Legendre, Candice Legendre. Hurry, we're waiting for you in the OR. You're late. No, no message. Well, yes, say it's from Stéphane. With all his love. Thank you. Sophie, I'm sorry about last night but I don't want you to call me -on my cellphone at any time. -You're never home. Well, I'm the one who calls you, okay? -How did you get my number? -You gave it to me. Really? Dang it. Will it really be small, my scar? No bigger than this. I said at school that I'd have a big one. We can't have everything, Adrien, appendicitis, a big scar... -Well then, I want a big scar. -But that's not up to me. Why? Aren't you operating on me? No. It's Professor Villiers. He's a great professor, you'll see. -How does he look? -He looks fine. -Like Geppetto, Pinocchio's dad? -Geppetto... Yeah. Yeah. I'd like to talk to you, Mister. -Is it him? -Yes. He doesn't look like Geppetto. What's the matter? It seems like you were at a gambling den last night. A gambling den. I was at Rodier's, Dad. You sleep three hours a night, during the day, you consult, you operate, how can you do it? I didn't even see you prepare your medicine. How do you manage with all these women? I only have one and I'm overwhelmed. That's why you wanted to see me? No, it's your mother. She doesn't want to go with me to the symposium. A weekend in Krakow on cell tissues. There will only be neurologists. The Carpathian mountains are beautiful. But I can't convince her. I don't know. Ask Sophie to go with you. Sophie is a good assistant. And I'm sure she's capable of... It's your mother I need. Thirty-five years of marriage. I've never told you, but at night, if I don't hear her breathing, I can't sleep. Then tell her. -She'll think I'm ridiculous. -You, ridiculous, Dad? So Adrien would've liked it if you talked to him before the operation. Yes, I know. I'll do it. I'll do it. Well, no. It's too late now. He's already asleep. You have to operate now. What? You put him to sleep? Yes, sir. I did what I was told to do. Yes, in Strasbourg. Are there a lot of Rivières? An entire page? No. No, I don't have the address. She's the neighbor, that's all I know. No, miss, I don't know the names of the neighbors either. Yes? Candice Legendre. It looks like she doesn't want them. Well, no, too bad. Thank you. What? I had to sign for the delivery. They seemed really sorry. This has never happened to them. Having the flowers refused and paying a second delivery to bring them back. Keep them, you'll have another victim in sight. Oh, very funny, Nathalie, very funny. Killer. What a killer. -Get off! -Get off! Come on, there. Yes, come on. That's good, come on. Congratulations. That shot of yours.... it was great. Oh, crap! I stepped on... -So? -So what? -Have you found her? -No, not yet. But don't worry, she's in your digits. Hold on, I'll give you my digits. -Holy cow. -We beat them 4-2, it's 5:37 p.m., so get a move on because I'm fed up, you hear me? So what's she like this time? Brunette, blonde, red-headed, nearsighted? I don't know, there's not much in stock. It's true. We should change cities. I only know half of them. Here, take a look. Brice, I'm not talking about the past but the future. So which one? I don't know. Which one do you like? But I like all of them. Just tell me which one. A real woman, passionate and faithful. One that I love, who loves me, who will last. Besides this horse, I can't see who else. Look over there. Her. -A bit snobby, though, right? -That's 138. -What 138? -It's 138! She is... snobby, she's fierce, distant, haughty... She's posh. Well, let's go for 138. Here, you unsaddle it for me. What? Hold on. But... Hold on. So, come on. Gentle, gentle, please. Don't move. Be nice. Be nice. You're a good boy. -Are you looking for something? -Me? No, not at all. what a question? Okay. Actually, yes. Uh... We're not going to start with a lie, right? It's for a game. If you can guess why I was looking for you, there's a reward for it. Hold on, let me think. You want to invite me to dinner, and maybe more? Well, there you go. You've already won a dinner. Now, tell me which restaurant and when, and... -Excuse me. -Sorry. So? So this will surely surprise you, but humor bores me. Oh! That's perfect. I hate it too. I can't stand humor. Stéphane Villiers, humorless. And you? Florence Leroy. BORDEAUX LAWYERS ASSOCIATION Poor thing. So the lady left? What's the matter? Cat got your tongue or what? Five hundred francs that by the end of the week, -I'll bring her to dinner. -Make it 1,000. -Deal. -Deal. Ouch, ouch. Stop. -You think you'll win every time. -Yeah, as always, my little Brice. Hello, Mr. Rodier. It's Stéphane. Not tonight. I'm not playing. Oh, well, yes. You know what? It's always a pleasure to take so much money from you so quickly. Tell me, you know everyone in town, a certain Florence Leroy, a lawyer maybe, 25 years old, tall, blonde, in a convertible, does that ring a bell? Quite pretty? Yes, very pretty. A bit distant but... -She works for me. -Really? -Has she been with you a long time? -For about a week. -So you've just hired her, then. -That's right. I see. Is she there? Can you pass me to her? -Of course. -Oh, thank you, thank you. What? She's there? He's passing her to you? -Hello? -Hello, Florence? It's Stéphane -from the polo match, remember? -Yes. Well, yes, you see. There are people who are just lucky like that. Yeah, that's for sure. You can't refuse dinner with me, Florence. -Yes, yes. I insist. -Okay, fine. I'll take you to a nice restaurant tomorrow night. Fine, then. A very nice restaurant, yes. Okay, Florence. -Let's say eight p.m.? -Yes, I'll pick you up at eight. -Goodbye, Florence. -Goodbye, Florence, goodbye. You see, my little Brice, we think it's hard but it's not true. Everything is easy. Yes. Stéphane? It's me. -Eva? Where are you? -Well, downstairs. Don't move. Don't move, I'm coming. You ran away, right? Are you from Bordeaux? You don't want to answer me? Okay, okay. -Where are you taking me? -To the cops. -But you can't do that to me. -I can, just watch me. Maybe you'll tell the truth to them. Come on, get out. Look, Eva, what do you want? You're messing with me and won't tell me anything. -Come on, get out now. -I'm not getting out! Stop screaming like that. I don't care! Don't you get it? If I go back, she'll hit me. I don't want to get hit. I can't anymore. I just want to be left alone! To be left alone! Wait. What are you saying? Who is hitting you? Holy cow! Who did this to you? My mother. Well, my stepmother. Since my dad died, she no longer holds back. Do you have a problem, sir? Uh... yeah, yeah. A big problem. Her bike was stolen. You have to make a statement. Yes, but she just confessed that she had sold it to her girlfriend for 150 francs. Can you believe it? A great three-speed Peugeot with a built-in bottle holder, a pump... Do you have children? No. Well, I don't advise it, sir. Officer. Come on, wear your seat belt and stop crying. -Take me to my home. -Stop it. What are you saying? I can't let you go back like that. I'm used to it. A bruise looks dramatic but it's nothing. Listen, I'm a doctor. I take care of children in the hospital. So if you're beaten, you have to talk about it, this is very serious. -Look, it's your lover. -Ugh, no. -That's her father. -No, that's not her father. -Want to make it a bet? -On what? Let's say... A whole year of pistachio ice cream for your hot chocolate recipe. Give me five. -That's awful. -What's awful? Making bets you can't keep. -Have you been to the Dune of Pilat? -Yes. -It seems very beautiful. -Yes, it's very nice. How is it? Well, there's sand, sand, and more sand. And in front, there's the sea. It's very beautiful. -Let's go. -Listen, Eva... Is that really your name or is that also a lie? Yes. We have to go to the hospital and do a check-up. Come on, let's go. I would've liked to see the Dune of Pilat at least once in my life. -Say yes! -Stop it! Please! Say yes. No! This is awesome! It's the best Sunday of my life. It's wonderful! Why are you leaving me messages everywhere? No, Nathalie, I'm not looking for you everywhere. Well, yes, I am but... -Where are you? -At the beach. -At the beach? -Yes, I'm at the beach. At this time? Yes, at this time? So what? Come in for a swim. Come on! Stop with your phone. Come on. You're no fun. She doesn't want to go to the hospital. She doesn't want to go home and I can't let her stay at mine, -so what should I do? -I don't know, be authoritative. Ah, bravo. That's great psychology. I ask for your advice and you respond like a policeman. Thanks a lot, Nathalie. It's so nice. Why didn't you come? You're stupid. Your legs look weird. What? What's wrong with my legs? They're not nice? No, I'm talking about the bruises. Why do you only have them on your legs? I'm tired of you talking about my legs. I'll never show them to you again. -And that's it. -Okay. Do you think I'm pretty? It's my chin that ruins everything. It protrudes too much, right? What are you saying? Your chin is very nice. You are very cute. Cute doesn't mean anything. First of all, it's stupid. -I'm annoying, huh? -No, not at all, not at all. You're annoyed, huh? What am I going to do with you? If I was 18 years old, it'd be easier, huh? You wouldn't be doubting yourself. -Does it annoy you that I say that? -Stop saying that you annoy me. -Why? That annoys you? -Yeah. -You're annoyed, huh? -Yeah. Ooh la la! That must be hard to climb up. What do you see from the top? Ah, ah! America! -America? -Yeah. -Me first! Come on! -What "me first"? -Come on, get up. "Me first," I say. -That's easy to say, "me first." Come on, go, go, go! Come on! Wait for me! I've never seen it before. She had a huge bruise on her calf. -Cheers. -Cheers. This is the address of my friend. He's a juvenile judge for 15 years. I wonder what goes through the minds of parents who beat their children. -Is it her father? -No, not her father, her mother. I mean, not her mother, her stepmother. Because her father is dead on top of that? Why does she hit her? Does she drink? The stepmother? No, not at all. No, I think it's more out of jealousy, if I understand correctly. She has two daughters from a first marriage, two ugly slobs who have it in for her. Wait. Her father is dead, she has a stepmother and two stepsisters, -is that right? -That's right, yes. Do you know what these two brats did to her the other day? No. She has a piano. Her playing is unbelievable. Well, to stop her from playing, they cut all the piano strings. -It's terrible, right? -It's terrible. -Excuse me. -What's the matter? It's not funny. How are you? It seems like you're doing great tonight. Yes, you're having fun. -The shoe, did you find the shoe... -Wait, I don't understand. The shoe? What shoe? Mind you, we can't blame her. She showed herself in the best light. You have to tell me, this sounds good. Wait, I would like to understand first. Prince Charming, Cinderella... Your little martyr told you the Cinderella story. Cinderella. She told me the Cinderella story. Damn it! Tell me, tell me. What's going on? He said that she told him her father died and that her mother... No way! Hello, Éva, it's Stéphane. Pick up, please. I know you can hear me. I want to talk to you, Éva. Hello? -You left her alone at your place? -Yes. But you never read the news or what? Stéphane, sorry, you'd better go. There's a very good chance that her friends are emptying your apartment. I'd hurry if I were you. Hello, Eva? Answer me, please. You'll be lucky if there's anything left. Some leave nothing behind. Anyway, there's nothing to take at my house. That's even worse. They'll be furious! They'll ransack everything. They'll tear the furniture apart. No, no. They can be very dangerous. That's true. Hey, hold on... Hold on, Stéphane! Stéphane! Wait! Stéphane! Wait! Here, take this, it's dangerous. -What do you want me to do with that? -Take it, it's dangerous! -You think so? -Yes. -Then come with me, come on. -No, I have dinner. -Brice. -No, come on, it's dangerous. Damn it, what the hell is he making me do? Damn it! I'm scared, huh. Stop it, Brice, they're just little punks. They're not dangerous. No, I'm scared right now. Slow down, please. It's wet! Look, there's a puddle there! -Eva? -Shh. Eva? Eva, are you here? Stéphane, come look. Here, look. There she is. As if it's a burglar. -Look, isn't she cute? -She's in your bed. Yes, so what? You're crazy, Stéphane. You're getting duped by a 12-year-old girl. -Hey, knock, knock. -You know what, Brice? -You're lame. -What? You're really lame. Come on. If she's making up stories, it means that there's a problem, right? We don't make up stories like that for no reason. You don't understand. This has never happened to you. Go on, leave me alone. Go back to your restaurant. And Florence? You handle it for me, okay? You better come up with a concrete plan because I like Florence a lot. Well, I'll get going since it's getting late. -All right, see you later. -Yeah, bye. Hey. And what do I do about the check? Note it down. That was plain glass. It's fine, it's good luck. Hey, Cinderella. Are you really sleeping? That's it. Sleep, that's better. Well, let's see. Liar. Eva? Eva? Eva, stop that. Plus, you're playing badly this morning. Eva, we need to have a word, do you hear me? Damn it. -Yes. -It's Florence. How are you? So has Cinderella left? No, she's still here playing the piano as if nothing happened. No, but she'll really go through it, believe me. You're not too mad at me for last night? No, it really made me laugh. I looked ridiculous, right? No, not ridiculous. Let's say naive. -Can I see you again? -If you want. -I'll pick you up tomorrow at five. -Okay, five o'clock. Yes, at the court office, okay. Your doorbell is ringing, right? Yes, it is. -Hold on. -I'll leave you. I'll call you back right away. Bye. -Oh, it's beautiful. -Mom. I'm so glad. Is she playing? -She plays so well. -Mom. Who is this? Liszt? Chopin? Give me a kiss. Why do you never call me before visiting? Because I'm your mother. So I did some grocery shopping for you. I brought you your shirts which were ready since last Saturday. -Say, you don't have a bathrobe? -Yes, I do. So you know, I had Brice on the phone this morning. I know perfectly well who this Florence is. It's the daughter of Hélène Gélinac, Margot's cousin. Well, I knew her as a child. As a child, she was already exceptional. Terrific speed, nimble fingers. -Who are you talking about? -Florence. Listen, listen. -What are you saying? It's a record. -Please, not me. So I talked to your father about it this morning. He is delighted. And me too. I know I shouldn't be. But the fact of the matter is... considering your love life, we end up worrying about you, it's normal. -I already have a ton of socks, Mom. -We can never have too much, dear. Florence! It's Mrs. Villiers, do you remember? Please, Mom. Florence? -It's a record? -Well, no, it's not a record. Oh yes, that's charming. It's a bit childish, but... It's... Oh, she made you your chocolate. That's lovely. It's fun to have graffiti at home. She is very... She is very... artistic, anyway. Eva? Eva! -If she wasn't 12 years old... -Yes? -No, nothing. -No, tell me. -She'd be like all the others. -That is to say? Rodier told me a bit about you. Aye, aye, aye. Careful. -Are you okay? -Yes. So what did dear Rodier tell you? That you were something between a philanderer and a cursed man. He's right, huh. I could bury you alive. Come on, let's go, she's not here. Are you sure she's the reason why we came here? Well, no, it was an excuse. Yes, it is. -So? -So what? Well, I don't know. The dune, the sun, the sea in the distance. A man, a woman... Some music? Damn it. The sound of the wind? -The sea in the distance. -No, you already said that. Really? Excuse me. Already? But it's 5:30. That's disgusting, are you eating her mouth? Eva! Where were you? Why did you take me here? Why did you do this to me? Eva, where were you? We've been looking for you for hours. Don't talk to me. You don't exist, you're an old hag. That's nice. He prefers old hags, didn't you know? -I said don't talk to me. -Stop, that's enough! Say, you'll speak to me in a different tone, huh. Yeah, that's it. Go see your mom at the zoo. -You moron! -That's enough, stop it! What are we doing here? Eva, where are you going? -She's lovely, Eva. -Stay here. You had no right, you can't crush my dream! Your dream, what dream? I don't care about your dreams! Look at you with your red nose and chapped lips. Can't you see that you're not up to it? And even as a girl, do you want me to say that I don't like you? You look like a tomboy dressed as a cheerleader. I'm not interested in you, is that clear? You are not Cinderella. Besides, Prince Charmings meet real princesses, not ugly ones like you. Get in, I'll take you back. You're a bastard, you betrayed me. You can die! I never want to see you again! Prince Charming, my ass! Damn it! Eva, come back! -I hate you, go away! -Eva, come back! Florence! Eva! Florence, take the car. Go around. Meet you at the bottom! Okay. -Eva! -Bastard! Eva, come back. -Eva! -What? Eva, don't go that way, it's dangerous. Hello? Stéphane? Where were you? I was looking for her. I thought you went back. No, I was in the parking lot for two hours. Two hours? Oh, damn. Yes, I guess you had a lot to say, right? As if, I didn't even manage to catch up to her. -What do you mean? -She got picked up in front of me. -Do you want me to come back? -No, no. I'll manage. Don't worry. I'll call you tomorrow. Excuse me, Florence, I'm really sorry. -Are you sure? -No, it's fine. It's not a problem. Are you sure you don't want me to come back and get you? Yes, yes. All right, kisses. I'll call you tomorrow at Rodier's. Kisses. BORDEAUX And you know what? It's like we're 20 again. We're doing it in the bathroom, on the furniture, in the elevator, in the car, even in the basement. You're right, there is nothing better than adultery to revive a marriage. Adultery? What adultery? What do you mean, what adultery? Your wife didn't run away for two days to go to Disneyland. Unless she was at the beach. Well, yes. Why not the beach? No. Monique? A lover? No, no. That's not her style. Listen, Stéphane. No. Honestly, Stéphane, you know Monique. Pardon me. What's gotten into him? Where is he running to? I'm not sure if we'll operate. It depends on the evolution. We must carry out additional tests and talk to Brincourt in neurology. You were with a little girl earlier in the hall. -You know, with the long hair. -Hmm. -Where is she? -Hmm. Anyway, with this case, we can only try. Sorry. Yes, sir. All right. The cerebral angioma is badly located. Today's scan is worrying. Are you going to operate, sir? If the symptoms worsen, yes, no doubt. And an embolization, it's not possible? In this location? But you're not serious, Jacquard. No one would be able to embolize something like that. No one. What do you think, Doctor? Ah, crap. If you operate, she may lose her sight. If we don't operate, then it's permanent disability. -How long has she been monitored? -Four years. -And the attacks have worsened? -Yes. Well, I'd keep her under observation and I'd request for a scan and a functional MRI. Then we must ensure that the angioma doesn't grow, otherwise... Okay. What do you say, Jacquard? -Uh... Absolutely. Absolutely. -Good. Have a seat, ma'am. Ma'am, your daughter has had more frequent attacks, right? Yes, doctor. She has them almost every day. I often come into the room and... I find her motionless with dazed eyes. I talk to her and she doesn't hear me at all. I don't like seeing her this way. I don't like it. All right, ma'am. It's nothing. There's no reason to worry. We'll keep her for a few days to carry out further tests. You'll be fine here, it'll be like your home. You'll make some friends. -I'd like to talk to you, sir. -Go ahead. I don't want you to take care of me anymore. What? I don't want you to take care of me anymore. Anyway, it's Stéphane who looks after me. If you told me about your illness, I would've listened to you, Eva. Seriously? Since I was little, I've been coming here each year and you've never seen me. But it was my father who treated you, Eva. I couldn't have treated you. Do you understand? Tomorrow morning, you're going for a scan. You'll see, it's fun. It's like a space capsule. You take me for an idiot, huh? The first time when I met you on the stairs, your mother knew? Yes, of course, what do you think? She trusts me. Do you understand that I need you? Are you sick? -You have to take care of yourself. -No, I'm not sick. And that's enough! Eva, don't talk to me like that! That's not happening. Don't worry. You'll see, we'll never be apart. You'll see me grow up and in three years, you won't have to feel ashamed. You won't have to worry about what others think of us together. Well, I'll be going. Ladies and gentlemen. See you later, Miss Castillo. That's right, see you later. You'll have a hard time getting out of this one. I know. I know, Nathalie. She has a hysterical fixation. We have to cut it short and take her to a psychologist, like you. Otherwise, it'll be a nightmare for you. I know her case very well. Her dad died when she was six. That was when the attacks started. It's her own way of mourning him, a sort of transference. You must not see her anymore. You think there's no danger because she's 12 years old but it's precisely because she's 12 years old that makes her formidable. Oh yeah? And what will she be like at 30? Éva? What are you doing? Where are you going? Like this, for example, you shouldn't interfere. That's exactly what she wants. -Where are you going? Give me that. -I want to leave. No, you will go back to your room. Ladies, please. Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Stéphane! Stéphane! Don't leave me! Don't leave me! I hate you! Let me go! When you don't talk like that, what are you thinking? -I'm dreaming. -Yes? What do you dream about? You can tell me, Éva. I'm here to help you. What do you dream about? That's great, Marie, you ate well. What's the matter with you? You haven't eaten anything in two days. Why aren't you eating anything? You don't talk, you don't eat. We'll put you on a drip. Come on, be reasonable. We'll leave it with you, you have to eat. It's for your own good. Okay? She's a stubborn one. Yes, it's good. There you go. All right, all right. I'm coming What's this? What's going on? Get dressed, she's a young girl. Wait, hold on. Who are you? The grandfather. But you're crazy, she had an IV. She has to eat. -Did Benoît let you do this? -Ah, his name is Benoît. -No way. -What are you doing? I'm calling the hospital to send an ambulance and a straitjacket for you. -Remove your hand. -She must stay here. -Remove your hand. -She has to eat. Look. Look, my friend. This was after her father's death. You don't remember her. She's been telling me about you every day for four years. So listen to me. She's going to stay here now. Because you are her medicine. She needs you, not the hospital. Look. She's eating. She's eating! Doctor, Samir will bring you a bag of clothes and toiletries. She will stay here for a few days. He's a tough one. He was in the Spanish Civil War. He was a colonel at 17 years old. He did well. Hello, Benoit. -Look, this doesn't interest you? -What? You don't want to know why I have a black eye? -I don't know, your wife's lover? -That's very funny. This morning, there was a madman who came in. -A Spanish man, I bet. -Yes, a stupid Francoist! Oh, no! A republican. The International Brigades, does that ring a bell? Let me see. You'll be fine. You don't have a heart, you know that? We have the right, Doctor. You know, we signed a release. A release. You have nothing else to say? A release... A piece of paper, do you think that will change a thing? And how will you treat your daughter? With herbs? A release! Did you hear? Why did you do that, Mrs. Castillo? We thought she'd be better at home. Listen, madam. Your child is just a little girl. You have to tell her what we all say to little girls, "You obey, you go back to the hospital, you eat, you sleep, "and you stop with this nonsense." You know, she's stubborn like her grandfather. Who's treating the people here, for God's sake? Do you know what your child is suffering from? Do you know what a cerebral angioma is? You've got to be kidding! In my 40-year career, this has never happened to me, never. This is scandalous, you hear me? Scandalous and irresponsible. Legally, I can't do anything. They will try to see you, that's obvious. -Would you tell me? -Of course. What was in the IV? Nothing, she didn't want to eat, that's it. What would you do in my place? But I don't know, Dad. She's your patient. Isn't she? I don't know what to tell you. -Ah, Adrien. Did you sleep well? -Yes. Miss Jennifer. Thank you, Monique. It was your grandpa who bothered you, pacing around and playing his music. We miss the piano. Anyway, you're coming back home next week when school starts. That was nice, why did you stop? Come on, darling. What are you doing? Eva. Please, not now. Why are you crying? Was I gone? Why do you cry each time? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Stéphane? Where were you? Do you zone out too? -Have you ever been to the Amazon? -No, why? Well, I don't know. You have a lot of books. You have a lot of tapes about Indians. But you know, those are things that I've had for years. There we go. -Embolization? -Dr. Arnaud, you don't know him? No, why? He was a radiologist at the hospital. He never examined you? You don't remember? No, I don't think so, why? Because his theory is interesting. It's a pretty new technique. You're not tired? Oh, that feels good. A bit higher. -Here? -Yes. Tell me, when you blank out, do you feel it coming? Yes. What exactly do you feel? Something. It's nice. A little dizziness, like when I fall asleep. But after that, I don't remember anything. That's all? Tell me the truth, Stéphane. What's going to happen? What? When you grow up? You will have forgotten everything. You'll be in front of your piano with the spotlight, the audience, the applause, all that. The life of an artist. The posters will have to say, "In case the pianist zones out, please be patient." Let's not get carried away, Stéphane. I'll never have a career. Listen, Éva, it can go away on its own. -And if not? -If not, I'll find a cure for you. Yes, that's it. Once I'm healed, you'll be rid of me. Don't talk nonsense. I just want you to be like any other girl. But I'm not like other girls. You're so insensitive, it's unbelievable! We've all recognized his competence. -Hello, Doctor. -Hello. Arnaud was the most brilliant radiologist I've ever had. But it's simple, my team worked better without him. -Professor, a phone call for you. -Excuse me. Yes? Two coffees, please. Right away, Professor. Excuse me. Arnaud was something. Yet you fired him. We did not fire Claude Arnaud. No, he disappeared. It's strange... You don't resemble your father so much but there's something. Yes. -You liked him, right? -Your father? Yes. No, Arnaud. Yes, him as well. I understood him. You know, he almost worked with me and then... He was missing a little something... courage, maybe. -Here you go, ma'am. -Thank you. -You're not eating your chocolate? -Please, go ahead. And his theory, does it make sense? It's remarkable work, but in order to succeed, you have to be reassured. And Arnaud was scary. And your father couldn't deal with it. Really? Why? I don't want to talk about it. I don't know about the girl's case, but if you want to go see him on my behalf, I think it's worth it to get his opinion. Don't tell him who you are. Do you see him sometimes? -Who? Arnaud? -No, my father. No, you know, we'd miss a date, then... then the second one... Then we'd postpone, we'd cancel... Then we put it off. And then time passes. No, sir, I can't bother him. He has examinations all day. Listen, miss. It's very urgent. I'm here on behalf of Professor Charvet. Sir, I'm sorry but Dr. Arnaud is operating all day, I can't bother him. Wait, you're here on behalf of Charvet? Come with me. So is she still in Geneva? Ah, humanitarian, good idea, right? But Arnaud prefers Agen with its prunes, the antique cars, and Marcel chateau. Is Claude here? -Arnaud, it's for you. -What is it? Hello, can I talk to you? Will you be busy for long? What should I do? Should I join you underneath? What do you want? To show you this, it's from Claire Charvet. Claire Charvet? Oh, nice! Bloody Charvet. There's only one solution, you have to embolize. This is a kid. -What age? -Twelve years old. Are you the dad? Do you know what embolization is? -Marcel? -Yes. Hurry up. I have to explain to him. I'll explain. So, this is new. Now there is no need to open. -Here, Marcel, hold this for me. -Yes. This is what we call the femoral artery. We take a probe, we introduce it into the groin. And we drag it along the artery, we go up, and up, and up, up to the problem. In your case, you have to go up to here. It's a little tricky. But it should be fine. So here, we'll embolize. Bam, bam, bam. -The problem... -What's the problem? We have three minutes, and no more. -Is it feasible in three minutes? -Yes. But nobody will want to do it, especially not me. -What do you do? -Me? I'm in confectionery. Confectionery... I don't know much about that. And Charvet? Still... You know, she almost led me down her road. But do you honestly see me as a Dr. Schweitzer? No. Now, Claude Arnaud is all about cars. I'm sorry about your daughter. I can't help you. Her name is Eva. At least take a look. What for? Here, I work on facelifts, sagging breasts, big noses. -And old cars. -Yes, old cars. And besides, they never let me do such a thing. When I was working at the hospital, I wanted to try and was thrown out like a scumbag. So now, Dr. Arnaud is making money. A lot of money. I agree with you, it's a bit ridiculous. Especially since I think that embolization is the only chance to give this child a normal life. -Theoretically, there's no problem. -What do you mean, theoretically? The brain, old man. The brain, one is never sure. Well, it's like the car that you saw downstairs. At the start of the season, with Marcel, we installed a brand new engine. It went two rounds on the track and blew a fuse. It wasn't anyone's fault, it was just our luck. We blew a fuse when we were technically in top form. You know, you're really crazy. Have you thought of what blowing a fuse means for a 12-year-old girl? What an idiot. Oh, Stéphane. What are you doing? Get down from there. That's dangerous for you. You can't stand on the ladder. It's starting to look like an apartment, right? So, do you like it? No. -Are you okay? -No. Well, I get it. You say to yourself, "She spent the day on the ladder, "she forgot to prepare me dinner." Yes. Well, it's true. I forgot. You forgot? You forgot? Really, I can't count on you. Stéphane, it's me, Sophie. Pick up. I know you're there. Please, pick up. She hasn't stopped all day. But I didn't pick up, I swear. Bravo, bravo. Hi, it's Nathalie. Listen, I want to see you. With this girl, you're making a mistake. You're screwing it up. Call me back. Nathalie? The psychologist or the lover? -I don't care about Nathalie. -Really? You really don't care what people say? Completely. -Shall we piss them off? -Let's piss them off. You're awesome. Shall we dress up? Come on, let's go. Good evening. How are you? You're not dancing? Come on, go ahead. Yeah, olé! -Where is Eva? -I don't know where she is. Go look over there. Éva? What's going on? Éva, do you hear me? Éva? It's nothing, I'm fine. I don't feel like singing, that's all. Then why are you hiding? -I didn't want you to see me. -Why? I didn't want to bother you. Well, from now on, you never leave without me. -You understand? -I promise. You swear? I swear. Here, eat it. Why is he mad? Are you mad? We're doing fine. Hello. Hello, Mom? Yes, it's me. Tell me, why don't both of you come over on Wednesday? I'll make a pound cake, we can play games and she can bring her friends. I'll put balloons everywhere. And then we can go... I don't know, to the zoo or even... the puppet show. What does she prefer? Uh... Yes, the puppet show, yes. Well then, I'll call your father. It'd be more fun if all four of us could go, as a family in a way. Why are you laughing? What are you laughing at? You're making me laugh, Stéphane. You're making me laugh. You even make me... You're making me die of laughter, if you want the truth. Damn it. Do you know why the Gipsy Kings play with the guitar's handle in the air? No. Because there's so many of them that there's no space in the caravan. -Tickle, tickle. -Ah, stop. So we agree, you do not step foot into the kitchen. Yes, yes. Seriously. Because I don't like to be watched when I cook. Oh, what have you done to me? How will we bring all this up? Why did you get so much yogurt? -For the calcium. -For the calcium, sure. What flavor do you prefer? Raspberry, vanilla, lemon, banana? Raspberry, vanilla, lemon and banana. That's amazing. I don't get it. You like everything or you don't know what you like? -Hey, psst! Stéphane. -Oh, Brice! -What are you doing? -I went grocery shopping. You went grocery shopping with a 12-year-old girl. Oh, is that forbidden? I should've had it delivered, then. -You'll end up in jail, Stéphane. -In jail, is there anything else? Anything else? It'll be a scandal, an indictment, an investigation, old man. What's with this madness? She's sick, did you forget? Not so long ago, she was tied down to a hospital bed. So she wants to kid around and that's what we're doing. Yeah, and you're acting like a fool. You know what? I'm taking flamenco lessons. Olé! What are you doing, Stéphane? Come on, I don't have the key. I'm coming, I'm coming. You remember how we both laughed before? We weren't worried or scared at all. Why have you changed? You know what, Brice? Grow old without me. Here we go. Château Smith, Haut-Lafitte 1970 for this gala dinner. Do I need to wear a tie too? This is a grand event. We have vol-au-vent as an appetizer. You like mushrooms, I hope? I love mushrooms. I love mushrooms. And to follow, what will we be having? Homemade paella. But mind you, with everything: chicken, squid, and seafood. But the hardest part is to cook the seafood without burning the rice. This tie is splendid. I took the ugliest one, I thought it would make you happy. Turn on the player and put on a record. Okay. It's music that'll go well with the tie, you'll see. Good evening. Thank you for the flowers, they were wonderful. Well, yes, the flowers... The telegram, the flowers, dinner by candlelight... It's a bit classic but it's still nice. -Are you going to explain to me? -There's nothing to explain. I made dinner, set the table. I'll watch a tape and go to sleep. Yes, sure. What did you say in the telegram? -Just one word. -What was it? "Come." It always works. Here, do coat check while you're at it. -Stéphane? -Shh. Do you know what this report is about? For the Tupamaro, the men marry 11-year-old girls. What do you think of that? They're crazy, right? Listen, you shut your mouth until it's time for dessert, okay? And for dessert, there are floating islands in the fridge. It's delicious, really. The key is to cook the seafood without burning the rice. -What? You made it? -Well, yes. Of course, what did you think? -You could've had it prepared. -Oh, no. No... It's not very hard. You seem a bit tense. Is there something wrong? Who? Me? Oh, no. Not at all. No, no. I feel fine. Very good. Very, very good. Relaxed. Some wine? You're not drinking? Oh, I am. I love drinking, in fact. I might even drink too much. No, it's true. A bit full-bodied, right? Are you doing it on purpose or are you really like this? Like what? I don't know, awkward, shy... emotional. Yes, yes, yes. Uh, no. Emotional, yes. Yes, in fact, my problem is that... I'm too emotional. Stéphane, what's the matter? -What? -Did you hear that? No. There was a noise... A kind of snoring... No, it's a whistling sound. Sorry? Oh! It's the water heater! When it makes a noise, it goes "boom boom." -What? -I have to check it now, or else... It's going "boom boom." I have to... I'll be back. "Boom boom." So? How is it? Is it heating up? You're going to pay for this, Eva. Very dearly. Why? She's lame, huh? Are you bored? Oh, no, not at all. We're having a wonderful night, just wonderful. Fine, calm down. If you're sick of her, kick her out. You're too scared? -Do you want me to do it? -Don't move, you hear me? I forbid you to go. Oh, you old people! We shouldn't go so fast, Florence. No, really, I mean... And I don't know, the paella, I... I feel all nauseous... There wasn't too much squid... right? And it's true, what I mean... We're not going to rush it like this. We have all the time in the world. Because if right away, we... What shall we do now, some coffee? Do you have coffee? Yes, of course, there's coffee. There are even floating islands. The coffee, do you want it with or without sugar? -Without sugar. -Without sugar. -So how's it going? -What do you think? So you already kissed her, that's over with. You've fondled her, or are you going to? Florence! Florence! Wait, Florence, I'll explain! Florence. Listen, it wasn't me. Florence, it was a childish prank. It wasn't me, I swear. She made the paella. Could you see me in the kitchen? Honestly, I don't even know how to cook an egg. I'm telling you, the telegram, the flowers, all that, I didn't know. Go back and play with her. You're both the same age, anyway. I've had enough of this. Good night, Stéphane. What are you going to do now? -We can't leave it like this, right? -Yes. Eva? -Where are you? -Here, in your bed... What are you doing in my bed? It's just for breakfast. Can I? -You're not angry about last night? -I did my best for the chocolate. -Yeah, it's fine. -Thanks. -You put too much butter. -But I'm better with the napkin. -Try it. My napkin is great. -What about the napkin? -Oh. What's this? -Open it. Will you put it on me? A necklace, a real one. For a woman. Shoot! It's not a men's necklace? I made a mistake, then. Wait! This one's an impatient one. Come look. Come here. -Look. -What? Don't we look great together? We found each other, we'll never be apart. Although there may be a small problem with age, right? -You can wait a few years. -Fine. The important thing is that we set a date. You have to learn to be patient, Stéphane. This is a Tupamaro necklace, a real one. -Do they really exist? -Well, yes. They say they have a drum instead of a heart. They're real savages. They're afraid of nothing. So you and I are two Tupamaros. What are we doing in Bordeaux? I don't know. We're lost. -Kiss me. -No problem... No, that's not right! Is that being patient? Oh, no. I swear, it wasn't me. -Hello. -Hello. Hmm, it smells good. Is that chocolate? -Did my dad send you? -No. No, no. -Do you want me to go? -No. So this is where both of us would've lived? It's beautiful. It's big. What's up, Nathalie? What do you want? -Is she still here? -Yes, she's nearby. How will you deal with her? I don't know. I will see. If you want to talk about it... No. As you like. You know that since you quit at the hospital, everyone's mad at your dad? You left a real mess. Well, I have to go. I'll be late. -Your apartment is very nice. -Thank you. I like it a lot. Éva? But... Where are you? Eva? Stop it, this isn't funny. Eva? Oh, damn! Eva? I'm here. -Eva, what are you doing here? -I didn't want to bother you. Don't move, I'm coming. Don't move. She's right. It's her. It's Nathalie who should live here. Not me. No, don't move, Eva. It's really nice how she told you she loved you without telling you. Yes, I still don't know how to do that. Don't look down. It's dangerous. Stay still. I like it when you're scared for me. Here. I'll give you the recipe for my chocolate. You learn it by heart, then tear up the paper. It's a secret. That way, I know you'll think of me each morning. Okay. Be careful. There you go, slowly. Slowly. -Stéphane, I think that... -Whoa! Careful! Éva! Come on, careful. All right, go ahead. How long did she stay in the Schwartz? -Seven, eight minutes. -Please, Benoit. Oh, sorry. Clearly... It's strange... Light coma, stage one... Coma vigil. Small tumor expansion... Take the file to Brincourt in neurology. I have nothing more to say to you, I warned you. There's nothing you can do now. Prepare for an operation tomorrow at eight o'clock. Very well, sir. Damn it, what a nasty piece of work. Hey! Hey! Hey! -The time, Marcel? -One twenty-eight! One twenty-eight, my God! -Your turn. -You'll see! We'll see if you do better. I've always said that in cars, brakes are useless. -Hold on. -What's going on? Stop! Are you crazy! Can you tell me where we're going? Tomorrow morning, we're opening up a girl's skull who will lose her sight because of a guy who didn't have the balls to go all the way. I can't help your daughter. She's not my daughter, Arnaud. I'm a doctor. I read your theory. So you're going to cooperate and embolize this angioma. I can't, I've never done it. Besides, my thesis was crap, it was a bluff. You have to stop now because I think I'm going to puke. That's just the jitters, it's normal. Come on, Cédric... it's bedtime. -But Villiers is here. -Villiers isn't here. Are you sure? -You want me to operate? -Yes. Have the parents consented? You really want me to do it? "Sperm whale." Scrabble! -Get moving. -Stéphane? We're operating on Castillo. We're doing the embolization tonight. Embolization? What do you mean? Who's doing it? Claude Arnaud. He's getting ready. Come on. -Oh, no! Not Arnaud! Not Arnaud! -What are they going to do? -No way. -And your father? What will he say? How is the blood pressure? It's fine. Come on, ladies. I'm sorry. Is this a party? I would like an explanation. A mechanic disguised as a surgeon, an unemployed poker player, and a lucky charm hanging on the front door. -Everyone, get out! -Continue, keep going. Do you understand what you're risking? It's a very delicate operation. He's never done it before. That's enough. He knows what he's doing, and you're not his father. -Actually, he is my father. -Ah, damn... Arnaud, please. Well, it's still curious, huh? When we look at the two of you, the most intolerant one isn't him. Or the most violent either. You see, we're not going to cut or open her up here. We're doing it gently, without violence. But if you try to stop us, I'll get very violent. You're risking everything, your entire career. I won't be able to help you. Do you know what you're going to lose? I know what I could lose, yes. Very well. -Blood pressure? -It's okay, we can go ahead. Come on, let's go. We'll make the incision. Let's go. Swab. Trocar. Compress. Another compress. Guide. Compress. Probe. I don't see anything. Change the area to 23. Go back to 32. Lower the contrast. -Is it okay? -Normal. It will be fine. It will be fine. Do you want a coffee? It's a very delicate operation. It won't be over until the end of the night. You don't want any coffee? Or some water? Anything? Are you sure, Mrs. Castillo? Of course, it'll be fine, right? You must not be afraid. You'll see, everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. That's it, we're here. We have only three minutes left. Go past the vertebral... Oh, it's going to be fine. Trombasilere, impeccable. Serum. Contrast. Come on, contrast. That's it, we'll hang it. Feeding pedicle. Not enough. Damn it, that's not good. We will redo a series diagonally. There, that's good. Push the microcatheter. Tube pump. -How much time is left? -It's okay. Go ahead, open it. That's it, my friend. We did it. -We'll wake her. -Great. Bravo. No, really. Hello, you'll see her soon. She's going to the recovery room. That's it? It's done? You're not even going to wait for her to wake up? No, I didn't wait for her to wake up. I thought she'd understand. And that's what she always did, right? Appear and disappear, like that, without warning. So I disappeared too. I left. I didn't tell anyone where I was going. Of course, I didn't even know myself. SEVILLE, EIGHT YEARS LATER... Hello. Hello. Did you sleep well? Oh, yes. I slept like a log. It doesn't look like it. What's the matter with you? I'm fed up. I'm wasting my time here. You know what? I'll fly back tonight. But really, though. I went to Brazil to treat children, not to come to a conference here, which is pointless. Honestly, what am I doing here? -Can you tell me? -Take a look at this. IN CONCERT EVA CASTILLO Oh, that's funny, Eva Castillo. -That's today? -It's her, right? Well, yes, without a doubt. -Will you take me? -To where? To the concert. You'll go see her, right? No, stop! I won't even recognize her! You know, a young girl changes a lot in eight years. Just look for the piano. She'll be sitting on the bench, right? You think so? There's a chance. There she is, go ahead. Go ahead. So? Great. She saw me, I saw her, we saw each other. Here, take the car. I'll walk back. Come on. What are you expecting? Me? Nothing at all. But really, nothing at all... Come on, you're ridiculous. What are you going to do? We're in Seville, Claire. I don't know. I'll hang around, check out the bars, listen to flamenco. You know, it's those tragic songs full of tears and heartbreak, things that make you cry. Well, there you have it. Good evening, sir. Thank you, sir. Shut up. I found this, is it yours? Yes, that's mine. But what are you doing here? We didn't have a date? Well, I'm late, then. You have an excuse, I hope. I got lost. ANA-MARIA VERA PERFORMED ON PIANO "LA GRANDE POLONAISE BRILLANTE" BY FREDERIC CHOPIN Show me how. Come on. Not too much, though. Subtitling: Hiventy
