Mister Pellegrini. Okay, everybody. Can we have one at a time please? Are City getting a new man this year? Yes, of course, yes. Excuse me. Is it Sterling? I cannot deny or confirm this at this moment. Is there any real questions you are going to ask here? Mister Pellegrini. What is your question? What can I get for you? Er, just a minute. Hey, did you get that, mate? Sorry, yeah. Sorry, I did not hear you. Can you repeat that again? Hey, Prings? Prings? Prings! Prings. What are you doing? I can feel it, bro. The ghost is back again. Your body is as big as a door, you have scary tattoos... and you are still afraid of that kind of thing? This is London, Prings. Shame on you. Do you really think there's no ghosts in London? That's why they made this. Look. "Ghostbusters". Peter Venkman to Winston Zeddemore. You snail. That's a film. Some of them are based on true stories. The likes of Valak, Annabelle. See? Where have you been anyway? You were gone for too long. Don't you feel sorry leaving me home alone? Why do you blame me? Sit down. Sit! What is it? -Prings! Where are you going? -Move! I'm going to sleep in your room! Prings! Where are you going? I'm going to sleep in your room. You go and meet the ghost in my room! Prings, you snail! -Hey! -Kiwi! Where have you been, man? Thanks. I got myself a short holiday. What about you? What have you been up to? Yeah, like usual. Still hustling. Trying to make the world mine. You'll be fine, mate. Oh, by the way, the graduation's tomorrow, right? Are your parents coming? Yeah... Don't tell me that you forgot. Actually, yeah. I almost forgot. These books, yeah. Do you know the history of this jacket, son? Your grandfather gave me this jacket when I got accepted to UGM. I also wore this jacket when I asked for your mother's hand. Can you guess... what I wore when you were born, son? This jacket? Yes, mom. I went home early. I am there now. How are you, mom? Are you doing well? Praise be to God, I'm well. What time is your graduation tomorrow? In the morning, mom. Nif... If you cannot find a job in London, just go back to Jakarta. There are lots of media offices in Jakarta. I'm sure your father would've understood if you couldn't keep your promise to him. And I will keep trying to keep my promise to Dad. I'm sorry. I could not help pay your tuition in London. Don't say that. I'm sorry, sir. I have to turn down the position. Hanif. Do you listen to yourself? I do, sir. That's why I have to turn down the position. It is an amazing offer, but... you know, it's not what I want. What do you want? More. I want more. And I need more. So I guess this is good luck, then. Thank you. Did you really quit your job at Five Guys? See? I told you. You're just wasting your time and energy there. Yeah, but I don't know what I'm going to do after this. My mom asked me to come home. Wait, what? Going back home to Indonesia? Seriously? Nif... You're not really going back to Jakarta, are you? -Nif? -I haven't decided yet. People dream to come here to have a better life... but you want to come home instead? I want that too... but I failed. What should I do then? So that's it? You're giving up? You went out your way to have your education here in London... and after graduation, you are going back home to Indonesia? What a waste. Don't you want to try something out here first? I said I haven't decided yet, Prings. Besides, we are different. I'm not rich like you. Hey, don't you play that card on me! -Hanif! -What, Prings? Hanif! -Congratulations! -Hey. -Happy to see you, man. -Thank you. Okay, do you remember Pringga? My best friend. My roommate. No, actually, the one who pays the rent. -Pringga, how are you doing? -Me? -Yeah. -As you can see, I'm so sad... bad, frustrated-- -Prings, stop it. What's wrong, guys? Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's good. Don't listen to him, okay? By the way, have you checked the email I sent you? What email? Come on, man. You said you need a job. Go and check it. Okay, Kiwi. Thank you. See you. Hold on. Let me grab my resume in my pen-drive. He is staying Nif, this means you can keep your promise to your dad. Amen! I think I failed. Come on. It's only been two days. Two days are too long. Be patient. It's part of what a job-seeker does. Just relax. Nif! -Hanif! -What? They replied! How did you know? You knew my email password? Do you want to know their reply or the story how I open your email? See? Snail. -Hi. -Hi. I'm Hanif. I have an appointment for an interview. Okay, if you just want to take a seat over there, I'll give you one of those. -Someone will be with you just a moment. -Right. Thank you. Come in. -Hi. -Hi. I'm Sophie. This is Angela. -I'm Hanif. -Yes, we know. Your name is on the list. So... How are you, Hanif? Sorry to keep you waiting. It's fine. So you're applying for the role of International Content Producer. Tell us a little bit about yourself. Okay. Well, as you know, I'm Hanif, originally from Indonesia. I've just finished my master at Goldsmiths University... taking TV Journalism. And have you ever worked in a media office before? Yeah... Back in Indonesia, I worked for three different national TV stations. And this would be very first experience working here. Do you like football? Yeah, of course. Don't keep the ball too long! Pass it! Watch out for defenders! -Goal! -Goal! Who is your favourite City player? Phil Foden. Our hidden gem. So I have a question for you. Where do you see yourself in five years from now? What are you working on, son? Indonesian Language. Composition. The topic is "What I want to be". Why would you compose what you want to be? Don't you know what you want to be yet? You can be a teacher, an architect... or be a pilot. Yeah, my teacher said about them too... but I don't want to be what she said. Do you have any other ideas, Dad? There are many of them. A lot. So I can be a teacher, a farmer... the head of sub-district, the head of district... a film star... a footballer... or a pond owner like Mr. Ghozali? Be a good person, son. You also can be a good person. Whatever you want to be, just don't be an indifferent person. I see myself grow, and become my fullest. I don't want to become just another sports journalist. I come to this line of work as something that matters. Something worth your attention. Did you bring the samples we asked you? Yes. Lovely. Well, we'll take a look at them and review them, and get back to you in two months. Thank you so much for coming in. It was so nice to meet with you. Excuse me. Two months from now? Is everything okay? -Yeah, everything's fine. -Good. -Thank you. -Thank you. Look. It's not that I don't like you. But, man, I can't take you back. I've already given Shawn the position. And I can't take someone who's only willing to work for two months. -Yeah, I know, man, but-- -I wish you luck, man. Nif, what's wrong? I read your text message. They will get back to you in two weeks, right? -In two months, Prings. -Wow. I don't know. And I didn't get my old job back at Five Guys. Why would you want to go back to work at Five Guys? I don't know. My head hurts. So what's your plan now? I need to find work. What about your work visa? I think it's still valid. This is London. You can't say something based on what you think. Relax. Let me help you just this once, okay? -No! -Come on. My dad could survive through college by teaching and herding cows. This is only London. I can handle it. So what's the point? You are wasting my time. That's also what you said when you walked into my apartment, Nif. Now, you should think about it. London has been hard on you, right? I think you're starting to doubt if you could keep your promise to your dad. No, I'm sure I can now. And now, you need my help. -Says who? -It's so obvious. No, Prings. I owe you too much money already. And I don't know how I am going to pay you back. I've never even said anything about that. -You've just said it. -When? Just now, you said it's your apartment, not ours. That is proof that you said something. That's not what I-- Nif! Hanif! Together for life, Nif! You snail. -Do you need a porter? -Yeah, I'm looking for one now. -I can do it. -You can start now? -Yeah, sure. -Okay. Well, look. If you can take the box over to the warehouse there. And we'll see how you are going. It's quite heavy. -See? Over there. -Okay. All right, Hanif. Put one there. Right. All good? Hanif! Come on, Hanif! -Come on, man! -Yeah, right, man. I feel like... I feel... Hanif! Oh my God. Come on, wake up. Aw... What's wrong, son? Nightmare? It's okay now. All safe now. Was it about clowns again? Oh my God. Did you wet the bed again? Okay. It's okay. The clowns are gone now. It's just a nightmare. It's safe now. Nif, you... You know what? I was once like you. You wet your bed too? Every brave man wets their bed once. So if you want to be brave, you have to recognize all your fear. I'm scared of clowns. There, you have become a brave man now. Hanif, you've got mail. You're not going out this Saturday night? Would you rather read your mail about your job application, or hear how my date with Charlotte failed miserably? So her name is Charlotte. -Can I borrow your computer? -No need to ask. Prings! I got accepted, Prings! I know already. No need to shout! I've read it. Sir, please forgive me. -I'm sorry. -Stop it. -Come on, sir. -What are you doing, Nif? You're my best buddy ever. Come on. I just want to hug you. No need for romantic statements like in Korean drama. That's so not manly. What do you mean? Come on, let's spend the night together. -Okay, sir? -No! I'm good with myself. Come on. -What? -No. I just want to say thank you. Now, the water is a bit cold at first, but if you run it for a while, it will be all right. As for the electricity, I recommend you keep it on low. And if you want Wi-Fi, you have to install it yourself. Although, I might know a man who can help you with that. -All right? -All right. -Thank you. -Yeah. Hi. -Hello, sir. How are you? -Yeah, I'm well. I'm new here. My name is Hanif. Here's your card. And the lift is over there. Hello? Sorry, thank you. -Nice jacket. -Hi. I-- Try to keep up. On your left are the desks for the seniors, the editors, and the translators. On your right are the desks for the interns, the graphics designers, and the producers. This is your desk. Here's your manual. Everything on how this place is run is in here. Take it home, read it, sleep with it, do whatever you need to do to know everything in here by heart. Okay? And new producers do not get to do live coverage. -Until-- -Until I say you're good enough. I don't know if you notice, but things can be a little bit cold around here to strangers. Don't worry. I'll make sure you're so busy, you will not even feel it. Any questions? Yeah. Where's the toilet? What did I say? Okay, thank you. Right. If you need me, I'm on a desk over here. But please don't. I forgot. Please, can you give this to Michael Hanson when you see him? Thank you. Hi. Nice suit. You're new here. Yeah, thanks. -Sophie asked me to hand these to you. -Cool. -Thanks. -You're welcome. I love you. -Hello? -Nif! How's Manchester, bro? Imagine hell but cold. Seriously? I thought Manchunians are nice? Says who? All my movements are monitored. That's a common problem for new employees. There's nothing you can do about it. Yeah, right? Like you know better. And you have to know. My supervisor. Whenever I ask her a question, she thinks that I'm stupid. When I don’t, she thinks I'm even more stupid. So annoying. But you are stupid. Although, I am worse than you are. What was that noise ? Is the ghost back? That wasn't the ghost. It was Charlotte. Baby, are you okay? -All is well with her? -Like a fine silk. But, baby, it's too small. That's okay. It's not small. Your dick is still small, huh? Hey, asshole. This is not about that. She's preparing dinner for me. You know what? Everything that we want came true. You get to work for Man City. And I'm dating Charlotte. Ya. Just like what your mom said. You Mr. Know-it-All. Later then. I want to help Charlotte with the cooking. Bye. Are you cooking for me? So sweet. Only carrot? Do I look like a rabbit? God is great. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. I seek forgiveness from Allah. Hi, Sophie. Pellegrini, the manager, has drafted the transfer targets for next season -Okay. -I sent you the questions. Check your phone. In order to get the answers, we need to be noticed. Now, your job is to accompany me and to raise your hand as soon as possible, before anyone else. He will only take three questions since he is running late. -Okay, got it. -You sure you got it? -Shall we? -Yeah. Okay, I have to apologize for being late. And I have some very personal matters to attend to. And unfortunately, I won't have much time to answer your questions. Possibly ten minutes. So I should go ahead. Can I have... Maybe join us? -Anyone wants to make a comment? -Mister Pellegrini. How are the players preparing for the next match? To my understanding, the players are preparing very well. They are very determined. They are working hard in training. And I believe they will give the best performance they can. But I think they'll be good, they'll be fine. Mister Pellegrini. What about lheanacho? Any comments on his performance from last week? Young players should be looked after and gradually introduced into the higher grade of football. But I think he's got prospects. Mister Pellegrini! Terrence? How do you rate your chances winning the League Cup? You know, with most cups, you go out and you... You had one job, one job! I know, Sophie. But I did raise my hand. I don't care. I just want the answers. It is important, this matter. I cannot look at your face. You can go home early. Sophie, no, please! What if I failed? I'm scared, Dad. There, there. What did I say about bad thoughts? Here. You can do it... as long as you become yourself. Okay? Are you okay? Yeah. Liar. Are you new here? No, not really. I've been here for six months, actually. Really? Never seen you around here. Yeah, well... Do you want one? Thank you. I've worked at this club for many years. I know every blade of grass in this place. Just like every lad that changed into his kit... like his armor. This place is like a shrine to me. And if this is a shrine and I'm the keeper... I know what unhappy looks like. So I'll ask again. Is everything okay? I just miss my home. I've been here for six months. And not a single soul has noticed my presence. Except Sophie. Because... she needs me to be someone she lashes out to. No offense, mate. But I cannot get how you see this place as a shrine. I think the people here are far from saints, I guess. The name is Chappy. Congratulations. You've just found your friend after six months. Hanif. Let me tell you. The deeper the pain... the better the scars will heal. These are the times that you should cherish. And soon, you'll feel at home here. It's going to be a nice evening. -Hey. -Hi. I'm going downstairs to grab some food. Do you want anything? Okay. Tell me something. What do you think about this clip? Okay. -Yeah. -It's bad, isn't it? -Do you have a second clip? -No. It happens so fast. I am not ready, man. God, I'm so dead here. No, man. Relax. This sound's still good. Maybe with some touches, we can make something. Just pick some necessary shots, I guess. Okay, yeah. So, you're new here? Yeah, it's my second week. That explains the panic. -I'm Javier. -Hanif. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. -You're an editor or-- -Actually, cameraman. But people here are so cold and a bit snobbish, so I didn't do anything other than editing. Yeah. Actually, I've worked here for six months, and you know what? Nobody pays attention like you do. -So shall we go downstairs? -Sure. Wait. You said you're a camera-person, right? Yeah. I have this small project in mind. And maybe if you have a video camera, you could help me? Sure, yeah, definitely. -Really? Thanks. -Yeah. So basically, it's like a vlog, you know? You know Chappy, right? Chappy, yeah, of course. He's a legend. That's the reason. He's a legend. So I will ask him to do the vlog together. -No way. Wow. -What do you think? I love it, yeah. I want to be part of that. Hanif, re-do this, and get them back to me in half an hour. Sophie. Oh, I shouldn't, but okay. -Hey, Hanif! -Hi. -Nice jacket. -Thank you. Thank you. Good evening, Indonesia. If you are watching this video, then that means you won tickets to meet the real Manchester City legend. Standing right beside me... the legend himself, in flesh and blood, Chappy. -Hi, Chappy. -Hello. So tell me. What am I looking at here? They are what I like to call armor, for the players. -Armor? -Aye. Because everyday out there, it's like a battle. They are fighting for their dreams. Okay. So tell me. As a player yourself, what was the biggest lesson you have ever had? It was a long time ago. I believe... that the deeper the pain you endure... the better the scars will heal. This is the time that should be cherished. Today we make tomorrow's memories. AMBASSADOR FOR INDONESIA OK. Thank you so much for your time, Chappy. -You are welcome. -Thank you. Okay, thanks for watching the first episode of City Today. I'm Hanif Thamrin, see you next time. Bye. Good? Guys, I want to share a YouTube video I've just recently discovered to you. It's about a guy named Hanif, and he is very cool. He made a video about his work in a Manchester football club. Nobody's ever worked in a Manchester club in the history of Indonesia. So you have to watch this video. So, Hanif, if you are watching this, you're the man. Hanif. For you. Hi, guys. The reason I gathered you all here, is we're going to have our charity quiz night again. Each department will pick a team of five to represent them. The winner will choose the charity the money goes to. And the losers... well... don't bother coming in tomorrow. The event is on Saturday night. So any plans you've got, cancel them. Good luck. See you there. I think that was very strong, yeah. Good. And this one? -I think-- -Hanif, right? Michael is expecting you. Okay. -Good luck. -Thanks. Ah, Hanif. Okay. I'm just going to be upfront with you. What's your knowledge like on football? -Same as everyone. -Oh, come on. I've read your piece. You have huge knowledge on Italian football. I think you could help the team. There will be all kinds of obscure football related questions. Sunday league, or even worse, Italian football. And I think you are the man for the job. Plus, since you're from London, and originally from Asia... I reckon your general knowledge is pretty good, too. So what's... I'm recruiting you for the charity quiz. It'll be fun. Thanks. At what year did Moreno Torricelli win the Champions League for the last time? -At 96-97. -Correct! Last question, for the final round. Name four members from the original Ghostbusters Peter Venkman, Egon Spengler, Ray Stantz, Winston Zeddermore. Is correct! So how come you know all that stuff? Your Ghostbusters? I have this thing with my friend, about paranormal stuff. -Really? -Yeah. -He's the best. -Yeah. Thanks, man -Can I borrow him for a while? -Well, you're the boss. -Laters. -Yeah. Orange juice? Really? You don't feel like celebrating? Yeah, this is my way to celebrate, I guess. So what's... I'm giving you live coverage. Seriously? Just like that? Not just like that. I've watched your growth, baby. Are you okay? I'm fine. I'm happy. What? Do you want to take it or not? Yeah, of course. Of course I'll take it. So who is the person that I have to interview? Pellegrini. Whenever I wear this jacket... a new history is written. I hope that one day, this jacket will be yours. Nice jacket. Thanks. I got it from my late father. Oh, thanks. I'm starting my fasting month now. Thank you for making me stay, Chappy. If you didn't talk to me that day... maybe, I would have gone back to my Hometown now. And of course... I couldn't fulfill my promises to my father. What kind of promises? You were right, Chappy. It's worth the pain. Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's good. Just be alert. -Remember, Pellegrini-- -Pretty unexpected? I got it. Relax, Sophie. Okay. See you, Sophie. You got it. See you. Here you go, thanks. Do you want that? -No, it's okay. -All right. -I'd just like this one. -Just this. Yeah. It's 20 pounds, please. -Thank you. Thanks. -All right. Thank you. Prings. Nif. I miss you like crazy. Baby, remember my best friend? My best friend, Hanif. Of course. How can I forget? Pringga's only friend. -Hi, Charlotte. -Hi. He's not my only friend. I have so many friends, like so many out there. Oh really? Then why do we have to go all the way to Manchester just to see him? Because he's one of the best. Yeah, actually, he has many friends. See? I told you. Invisible friends. Ghosts. You guys agree, right, that ghosts exist? But you don't know where they are? Still, it's better to be careful. And you know what? When he senses there's a ghost, he will read a bunch of verses from every religion. Because I don't know their religion Hanif. -Come on. -Oh, come on. They are ghosts. Why did you bring this up? Didn't you get it yet? Okay. Enough about the ghosts. You guys are funny. No, seriously, this is about you and me, us. We need each other. We support each other. And no one is leaving another. That's deep. -You snail. -I'm really cool, right? What? Happy birthday to you Sing with me. Happy birthday to you Happy-- -Thank you, Nif. -Thank you, Nif. -That's what I call deep. Why is it so small? It's not payday yet, sir. Okay, enough with the bromance. Who wants some more soju? Soju? Definitely me. Bring it to me. -Me, me, me. -Hanif? He's not drinking any alcohol because it's fasting month. So why are you not fasting? Me? Because... because it's his birthday. Because it's my birthday. Yeah, that's why. It's my birthday, so... hello, can I order some soju please? This the best birthday party ever! You know, I want to pee. -No, no, no. -Yeah, why not? I want to pee. -Come on. -Not here, Prings. Why? -Come on. -I want to pee. -Come on. -I want to pee. I have the legendary move, the worm dance. -See? -Yeah, it's cool. -It's cool, right? -Come on. Oh no. -Come on. -Let's go home. Is this a real taxi or fake taxi? It's real taxi. Come on. How do you know? Babe, you go first. -Bye. -Bye, Charlotte. You're my best bro ever. Thank you for everything. Happy birthday! Birthday boy! -Bye. -Bye. Thanks. Good morning. Fuck! No! Hey! Sophie. Sophie. Sophie, please, I'm sorry, please. Do you listen to what I tell you? -Yeah, I do. -What? What do I tell you? -To be alert. -But you think I could reschedule him? Yeah? This is ridiculous. I feel like I'm talking to a four year-old. One more thing. Your little video blog... 50,000 views in a couple days. Wow. Guess what? Means nothing to me now. Zero. Sophie, please. I'm sorry. Give me another chance. Please. You had your second chance. You ruined it. Welcome back to pitch side. I hope you are happy. Mister Tour Guide. Bro, are you okay? I'm okay. Don't lose the cards, okay? -Are you sure? -I'm fine. -But you don't look fine. -I'm fine! Sorry. Let's go. Nif. If you are not in the mood for this, it's okay. Charlotte and I can go somewhere else. What do you want me to do, Prings? Happy and cheerful like tour guides in general? I'm working here! Yeah, we know. That's why we don't want to bother you. Sorry. -Let's go, baby. -Oh, yeah. It's so good to be you. All you do is sightseeing, relaxing, eating, drinking. No need to work hard. What's wrong with you? I even doubt that you understand the word, "hard-work". -So you are angry at me? -Yes. -Your best friend? -My best friend. My one and only friend. Don't you realize? You never do anything for your life, Prings. You're useless. You do not have any skills. While your friend works hard every day to eat! Do you realize? That you are my biggest problem? At least, I've never been a freeloader when I lived in London. Hey! Stop! You know what? All this time I was trying to become a reminder for you... so you could keep your promise to your dad. But I never thought... you could only get this far. Jesus Christ! When I was a lad and I felt down... me mom used to tell me to cry even harder, let it all out. Get rid of it. I'm so down, Chappy. And after I cried like a baby, she'd say, "I know it's cozy down there, but the world misses you. So come on... climb yourself up. There's nothing left to do down there." I'm scared. I can't keep my promise to my father. We all have promises, Hanif. To other people... to ourselves. And we get so busy trying to keep those promises, we forget to live. We think we own those promises. But the truth is they own us. We've become a slave to those promises. When we should be the master of our own destiny. We should control them. Not the other way around. Rise up. I know it's hard. But it'll be worth the pain. Thank you, Chappy. It's all right, lad. It's all right. Hi, Javier. Hi, Chappy. Good to see you brought the camera. And the tripod will be useful. Yeah, but why are you here? I've come to pick you up. I want to take you to me friend's house. What? I asked you to bring the camera for a reason. Okay, and the reason is? It's a surprise. Let's go. Come on. Come with me. Hello? I'd like to introduce you to me friend, Hanif. -Hanif, this is our host. -How are you? -Hello, Hanif. -I'm good. Thank you. Chappy, how are you? -Nice to see you. -Nice to see you. -How are you? -Yeah, great, yeah. Thank you, Chappy. It's an amazing Eid for me. No problem. Have you fixed your dad's jacket yet? I think my wife can do it. She's not a professional tailor, but she'd give it a go. Yeah, sure. I'll bring it to you later. I think... for the first time in my life... everything's going to be just fine now. Thank you so much, Chappy, for everything. No, thank you... for the friendship. At my age, just having a friend to talk to is more than enough. You should go to sleep, dad. I have slept all day, son. Then go back to sleep. I don't have someone to talk to these days. Praise be to God you are here now. -So you want to talk to me all night long? -Yes. Mom will get angry at me. It's okay. Let her get angry. It's okay. Your mom once asked me a question. What made me proud of you, Nif. Just as I'm proud of Yuri. Only you can answer that. Please give Mom's question an answer. I promise you, Dad. I promise... I'll answer Mom's question. Pellegrini, as requested. And if you need me, I'll be at the press conference. Mister Pellegrini. Okay, everyone. One at a time. Mister Pellegrini. Are City getting a new man this year? Yes, of course, yes. Mister Pellegrini. Excuse me. Is it Sterling? I cannot deny or confirm this at this moment. Next. Mister Pellegrini. What's City's preparation for this year's cup? The usual. But, you know, practice makes better. Can I have some questions with meaning here please? HAPPY NEW YEAR AND SORRY FOR EVERYTHING -Hanif You snail. Michael, quick! Come and have a look at this! What's the emergency? Any team in the Champions League will attract good players. But I want Kevin De Bruyne. He is the missing link for this team. If we get him in this team, this team could do better. It's going to be really difficult and hard to get him. -I maybe have to wait... -Where is Hanif? -until the last day of transfer market. -Javier? Mister Pellegrini. Yes, Hanif, what is your question? If this is some scary thing, I will be angry. No, sir. But you are a prankster. Hanif! Oh my God. Oh my God. It’s been a while since we played PS. Really? Here? You really are a snail. Okay, ready? -Hey, don't cheat! -You're the one who's cheating. Okay, sir. Okay! What? You snail. Sir, but my goalie slipped. -What did I tell you? -Let's restart it. You just watch. Hey, you cheat! Pass! One all! Eat that!
