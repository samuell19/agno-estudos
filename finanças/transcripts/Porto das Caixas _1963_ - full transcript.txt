I was at the chemist's. Are you sick? No. Then? I went to buy a soap. Is there any kerosene? No, there isn't. There's fucking nothing in this house! There's no money. Money!... That's all you can say! You could find it. How? You are away the entire day... You think I didn't know? Bitch! Cut it out! Why? "Why"!... "Why!" That's all you can say! D'you want me to go get kerosene? D'you want that? - How? - My way! - Does it take long? - No. Just a moment. Go, then. Go, 'cause I'm starving! Did you there's a woman with a strange sickness in Uba? She had something on her skin and they said she had turned into a serpent. In the end they found her in the hospital by the street. Where there's the stage for the procession I told you about. Everything was ready: the stage, the chorus... everything. The mayor, the faithful, the pilgrims. When suddenly a donkey comes down, loaded with cans, making... - Antonio... I want kerosene. D'you have money? No, but the next time... There won't be a next time. Why? I've already told you. You won't have it without money. Only for this time... I had already warned you. - It's true... you had. - Then? I need it, Antonio! I need it! - Then... - Then what? Nothing. Give me this. Here, witch! Thanks, Antonio. It's so dark outside... Couldn't you lend me a lamp? I'll go with you. You watch the shop, alright? You can go back now. - What? Just like this? - Just like this. No, not like this! You have to be mine! I'm not all alone. That's right... you're mine. You're weak! - Why weak? - Because you are. What d'you mean? Why weak? Why? Because you wouldn't be capable of doing what I want. Everything I want... I would be, my love. I'd be capable of everything. - Of everything? - Of everything. Here it is. - How did you get? - What d'you care? - We have no money. - Me, I have credit. Slut! Why do you always insult me? Because you ain't worth nothing. - Think so? - Yes! Slut! Cheap slut! Why don't you leave me, then? No! You are mine... Mine! - You're mine! - I'm no ones! Stop it! Damn you! One day you'll pay for this... Almost. - Hit! - Try again. - Who are they? - Look like politicians. They're never absent when elections come. If promisses would be money, Porto das Caixas would be rich. It's on time. - Have you heard? What? I said it was on time. - You'll be staying like this all day? - What's it to you? It's a mess in here. - Everything's dirty and empty. - It's always been like this. You should tidy things up. There even is no trace of wood. Money? I've only got these. I'm not saying you should cut wood; that's no work for a woman. Here. Buy an ax from the market. All faithful are invited to the St Peter procession. Come to St Peter's procession! There's nothing but oxen in the square! Come and meet Our Lord at the procession! With the help of faith we'll find the road to Salvation. Come to St Peter's procession! D'you know where they sell axes? I want an ax. - What kind? - Not a very expensive one. Will this do? Is it alright? No, it's too small. I've got others. - I got one... - Does it cut? This one? Yes. Sugarcane juice!... Lemonade!... No, I don't need it. Is it for cutting wood? For cutting wood too... - What? - Chicken. I need it for killing hens. Why did it take you so long today? Was the train late? What's with you today? What's wrong with me asking? You never were interested in the train being late or not. But now I am. It isn't late. It's coming in. You know... I couldn't get you out of my mind today... Why can't we live like everyone else does? What's the matter with you?! We could live like all the other people do. You... Don't you love me? I do. - But you... - I do too... I want you now, tomorrow... .. everyday... .. and now! Wait! I bought what you told me to. - What? - An ax. Look there. It cuts well, if the wood isn't wet. Go away! Hurry up and bring me a cloth! I've hurt myself! Damn it! Hurry up with that cloth! Shit! You devil! I can't go to job today. Can you let the station know? Ready. If you'd really like me... I like you, I've already told you. No, that's not the way. - How then? - In a more serious way. Nonsense. You already know I'll take care of you when you'll leave that redneck. I need to have certainty. To be sure. - I swear. - No! Not this way! How then? - Speak. - For instance, would you be capable of killing someone for me? - Kill someone? - Yes, kill! That doesn't mean I want to kill anyone. - Oh it was just like that... - Yes. I'll kill, then! I'll kill everyone! Damn ax!... Look how it's swollen! I'm forced to sit here like a cripple! You wanted it. - This one?! - That's all she had. You could have bought a smaller and less sharpened one! - You buy it next time. - This is the last time. I don't want no more axes. You won't have any, don't worry. Already?!... It's late. Didn't they say anything at the station? - No, they didn't say anything. - How come?! They said it's alright. This foot ruins everything; I won't be back to work too soon. I know. - I know. - What d'you know? You seem nuts! Listen... I don't like growing a beard. Call the barber tomorrow. The one at the beginning of the street. - Are you coming already? - Right away. The blade is not sharpened enough. Shit! Nothing works! Not even the barber. You complain about everything. That's a great remedy. - Who's bringing the money now? - Do you lack anything? No. How do you manage to get everything? Sometimes... .. I feel like you don't love me; that you only hate me. Would you be capable of doing something for me? What do you want me to do? This razor... has a good blade. - It's old. - But it cuts! - Cuts what? - Cuts everything. Even a man's throat... Youo must be mad! See? I've cut my finger! That's nothing. - At this hour you're coming? - I went shopping. - You're wasting money! - You wanna eat, no? - That stinking food! - Get off me! One of these days... I'll dump you and I'll go away, I'll disappear from the face of the world. - Would you have the guts to? - You'll see! - Then, you've got a lover. - Moron! How would I find him in here? What do I know, you're capable of anything! Leave me and you'll see what happens! A lover... That was all that was missing... A nice pair you've put on me. Hey!... Where're you? I'm in here! Why did you call me? Nothing! I just wanted to see you. What a woman... Don't you know I'm working at this hour? Are you playing hide-n-seek? Was there anyone at the bar? Weren't we to meet tonight? Is this how you love me? You know I'll be with you when you'll leave that moron. Then? You're impossible. I can't lose time this way; I must see to my life. - Who's going to pay my debts? - I'll help you. I can't wait, I have to work. There's time for these problems; I need you now. I can't now. I've already told you I can't. Tonight. And if I won't come? Maybe I'll be with someone else. - A man? - Yes, a man! Another man. That's to teach you I'm not a moron llike your husband. It'll be different with me. And if I catch you with someone else, you'll get get! Understood? One more. - Hit that one! - Wait and see. Good shot! - I kill everything I see. - Really? - Don't you believe me? - It's easy this way. They're pretty close. - Then go fifty steps away. - That way? No, that way. Where it says: "Cold beer". - You don't believe it, but it's true. - You're always bragging. - Shall we arm wrestle? - Yes. - Better? - Yes. - Another beer. - We haven't finished this one! - Why have you turned them all on? - I'm happy. - I knew I'll run into you. - How's that? - Got some powers. - What kind? - This kind. - What're you doing? Cut it out! No! Alright! - Aren't you playing anymore? - I've already got what I wanted. - Can you drink it all? - And you? Come, I'll show you. Tastes like vinegar! You're brave. Think so? I don't know yet. You live quite far. You have to walk a bit. It's close to the abandoned factory. By the destroyed house? - Where's the destroyed house? - By the abandoned factory. - How's your house? - It's a small shack, painted in white, with green windows. - Can I come along? - No. - Why not? - I'm married. - Really? - I swear. - It doesn't matter, we can do it here. - No. - You're worse than sergeant Giona. - Who's he? A guy from the barracks. - I'd like it to rain... - Why? You're handsome... - You've surely got lots of women. - Don't care about none, I only want you. If I'd ask you, would you something for me? I would. I'd do anything. - Leaving already? - Yes. I'll do anything! I'll do anything you ask me! - And if it's something very difficult? - Nothing's difficult for me. - And if I asked you to kill someone? - You saw how good I am! I'm talking for real. Really kill? Yes. Take a man's life. You're mad! Wanna see me in prison? Wait! - If you cool off, I'll tell you what to do - Let me go! I don't have to tell anything! Fool... only wanted to know what you'd do. - Where were you? - Walking. Walking... .. with me here, not being able to move my foot. I'm no nurse. What are you? You don't know? I know what you are! A bitch. A cheap bitch. You're shameless! A degenrate, that's what you are! And you're an useless stinking old man. - Put that down. - No, you might hit me. With this? Who knows... Maybe that's why you bought it. Who knows... Why didn't you come yesterday? What you told me yesterday... I thought you went mad... Damn... I've waited the whole night. - They told me you were in town. - Who did? Lots of people. But I didn't believe them. After what happened yesterday I was afraid you wouldn't love me anymore. - You haven't stopped loving me, have you? - I'm used with this. I was an idiot. But I didn't want to do it, you know. But I got mad. Wait, forgive me. Forgive me. I... I can't live without you anymore. Let's get out of here, leave everything behind. - D'you want him dead too? - Me? I want a child! D'you want it too? I want it too!... I want you! People in Porto das Caixas, come to the Itaborai meeting! We'll encounter our candidates! They'll deliver their speeches in Itaborai main square. Don't forget! See you later! See you later... Take it. Where is he? He's sleeping. We have here our candidate for mayor. I can't do it. Wanna see how it's done? So we hold the agrarian reform as the most important thing. We must fight for this reform! How could we obtain it without a fight? It's for the people! Mine is a starvation wage, and I'm a man who works hard. People who work can only afford beans! It's tough living like this on our land who has lots of mosquitoes and little beans. It's true, you got it right! An agrarian reform without beans it's not a true agrarian reform! Why... give me that. The agrarian reform... how did go on? We're world champions and we starve to death! It can't remain here. What will we do? Help me. Won't you say anything? What should I say? What's the matter with you? - Nothing. - Are you afraid? Let's go. Shall we go? No. I'm not coming. I am going. - THE END -
