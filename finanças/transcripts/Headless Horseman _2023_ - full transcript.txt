[panting] [sighs] [phone rings] [whispering] Shit. Shit... Shit. [chuckles] Hi, Angel. Um, it's good to see you. Listen, I think you might have the wrong idea about me, man. [grunts] You got sticky fingers, Lorenzo. No. Angel, no! Anything that this guy's telling you or that anybody's telling you about me skimming, they're lying. So why were you running? Full transparency, I didn't know it was you guys. - I've got enemies, okay? - [phone rings] I wonder why. Whatever you're thinking about doing, you don't have to do it. Just let me pay you back. Please. Okay, good job. This is how you pay me back. [groans] [slicing sounds] I'll tell Angel. You let Fleck know. That was Jose. I think he found your girl. Excellent. [sighs] I'm seriously regretting my decision. I'm gonna look like an idiot. Oh, but you're so cute when you look like an idiot. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. So, yeah, at some point, we should start planning this wedding. You're right, and when you're right, you're right. And don't you forget it. Oh, that reminds me... Shelby wants us to pick up candy corn for the party tonight. Oh, candy corn is crucial. I never got into it. But I can see the appeal. [phone rings] Hi, Crystal. What? What about Andre or Alena or Warren? What's wrong? Are you kidding me, Crystal? That's so unfair. Not tonight. I haven't had a day off in weeks. Brandon, there's someone watching us. What? Okay, fine, but you owe me huge. Bye. - Who was it? - I don't know. - I didn't see anyone. - Are you kidding? He was right there watching us. Probably just some trick or treaters. I have to go in to work tonight. Inventory issue. - Tonight? - No one else is available. But Crystal said it should only be a few hours and she'd pay me time and a half. That sucks. I know. Um, will you wait for me? I have to shower and get changed. Who needs to shower when you've got this? What are you doing? Mission accomplished. You're smiling again. Join me. I dare you. Oh, yeah? Yeah. [chuckles] Hey, Brandon, I just closed up at work. I'm the last one here, so I hope you're on your way because I don't wanna wait around outside for too long. Some folks may get the wrong idea. Anyway, if you can call me back, that'd be great. Okay? Love you. Hard day at work, Sofia? Fleck? What are you doing here? Rude. Long time, no see. Did Angel put you up to this? You know I've never done that shit. It's just coke. I'm not touching that. Come on. It only hurts 'til it feels good. Then it's real good. How did you even find me? Angel's been looking for you for months. He wants to put the past behind him. And you expect me to do what? Stop! You should really walk away. As soon as you shoot up, I'm out. My fiancé's gonna kick your ass. Oh, I'm so scared. Sorry, I'm late. - What's going on? - He found me. We have to go. - Wait, who found you? - Let's get out of here! Gilbert disabled the bike. Meet up with him and grab them before they hit the main road. Asshole knocked a filling loose! Who was that guy? Did he hurt you? I'm fine. He works for Angel. Your ex? I didn't think he'd try to find me. Yeah. I think he's not over you yet. Let's go. - He parked his bike around here! - They're following us! [engine sputters] Are you kidding me? Somebody yanked my fuel line. There they are! We gotta run. Gotcha! Brandon, we have to get out of here. They're not gonna let us go. Angel doesn't give up. We have to go. Go where? We head back that way, we're boxed into an underpass. Across the bridge is the only way out of there. We're not gonna make it across the bridge, Brandon, they'll kill us. We'll see. Listen, if you have a chance, a moment when they're not looking at you, you take it. Don't worry about me. I'm not leaving you! This is all my fault, Brandon. - I'm so sorry. - Don't be. You're worth it. Let me handle him. This could be fun. You sure? Oh, I got this. You know, we only wanted the girl. Yeah, I got that. - Do me a favor, Fleck. - Absolutely. Go around the bridge and make sure Sofia doesn't ditch her fiancé. Yep, yep. You didn't have to be a part of this, but now you're in the way. And it's going to stay that way. Show me what you got! [grunting] [shouts] So pretty! Angel wants to say hi. Calm down. [grunting] Personally, I don't get it. Get what? What she sees in you. Should keep the bang-bang to a minimum. LAPD loves that sound! Yeah, yeah. No! The name's Angel, by the way. Nice to meet you! Stop, leave him alone! You were very hard to find. But worth it. You son of a... Agh! I've been called worse. Why did you do this? What can I say? You were the one who got away, Sofia. After all these years, I'm still not over my high school sweetheart. Hey there, let me see it. Nice rock. Layaway plan? I never loved you. [Brandon groans] Hey, look! Look at this. No! He's a bullet sponge. Hey! Angel. Let's get outta here! Cops will be on us! This is all your fault. You should feel terrible about this. You do understand that, if I can't have you, no one can. But maybe I'm being too hasty. She's going to work for us. Work for us? Are you serious? Dead serious. She'll mule for us. Besides, we need a new body now that Miguel got pinched. She won't cooperate! Luckily, it's not up to her. Javier is not going to like this. What will stop her from yapping to the Federales? Because I know where mommy and daddy are now. Oh, yeah, I found them, too. I wonder if they remember me. She talks, I gut them like fish. She plays along... maybe she gets to like it. Shall we? Still alive? Oh, my God, Brandon! Jesus. This one is for the scrapbook! He's like a roach! Then we should smash him. 'Tis the season... Stop! Leave him alone! Oh, don't worry about it. In 24 hours, you'll be across the border. No! And so doped out of your mind that you can't even remember your own name. Happy Halloween, son! No! [laughing] Smile. Funny boy? How's this? Is that funny for you? Let's go, Fleck! Help! Please! God... [cackling] My! They have left you in shambles, friend. Who are you? You called for help. Help has arrived. Look at you. Pitiful end. Police... [chuckles] You can forget about that. You're dead and gone now. You live now on my behalf. You cried out and I heard because I'm always listening for the wayward soul. I'm always in the market for a bargain, looking for those willing to risk it all. You're not real. I haven't got all night and neither do you. Sofia... they've taken her. Oh, I know. I saw and you want her back. Yes! And you want that dirty drug dealer piece of trash and all of his men dead! Yes! I want something too. Quid pro quo. You want a do-over? I will give you what you need to accomplish that. - For a price. - There's always a price. If you thought different, you'd be lying to yourself. Nothing in life or death is free, kid. What do you want? If we're gonna go forward and I'm gonna share the details of our agreement, you will be forfeiting your final asset. My soul... but how do I know... That I can do what I say I can do? That I am who I say I am? You see that carcass? Wanna see him dance? What happens to my soul after? Stays with me safe and sound and warm year round. Now I will give you the tools and you will do the dirty work. How? I will give you the means to bring about your righteous vengeance. You kill them, I claim them. I collect all the souls you harvest. You can have every last one of them. You get 24 hours to do it. After that, it's too late for you and your lady love. Understood. Do we have a deal? Very well. Let's turn you into an instrument of brimstone-fueled fury. How are you gonna do that? Every hero needs a right-hand man. With this, you will be unstoppable. You will be the instrument of the vengeance you desire. I will plant the seed... that allows you to flower. There now. Don't resist it, kid. Embrace it. Now that is a thing of beauty. You are going to put the fear of... of God into... one more thing, one more thing. There! There, now we're talking. Now you have a gift that you can turn on and off as need be. You can walk among mortals in disguise. How do I work this thing? Practice makes perfect. You see that dimwit bag of bones? See what you can do. Soul mates, huh? So why this guy? What does... did... he have that I don't? Seriously, humor me. I'm looking to improve. I understand the need to feel optimistic. But, come on, let's be real here. You'll love Mexico this time of year. Who am I kidding? Sucks all year round. Always smells like piss and garbage. [car honking] What now? What's up? I feel like an idiot. What else is new. What happened? I gotta go back. For what? To get arrested? I think I dropped my phone. I can't find it. Maybe when the douche bag tripped me. Are you kidding me right now? I know, I know. I'll be quick, but I can't leave it behind. I'll circle back before the cops show up. Meet me back at the house. If you get pinched, call Moira, not me. It's not my first rodeo. [grunts] Now this beauty packs quite a wallop, kid. Give it a try. Don't tell me that you're feeling bad about this bag of bones! I've never killed anyone before. You never forget the first time. Okay, look. If it'll make you feel any better, this guy, he killed two innocent women a couple years ago. And he got away with it. Not too shabby, huh? What if I hurt innocent people? It's on you. I still get the souls. Look, kid, just make sure that the intended victim is on the other end of that glove. Now I gave you a little special something for those people you like the least. You want a little extra oomph? Give in to your rage. Give in to your anger. Ooh! When you get all hot and bothered, boy, can you cook! Just will it and the gauntlet will obey! Blow a hole in him. I wasn't expecting that! No one ever is. That's why it's my favorite. Let's go again. I want you to get more comfortable with your little friend there. The more you practice, the more souls I get. Kid, let me ask you something. What is it with you and this girl, huh? You know, the human connections, they intrigue me. Is it love at first sight or what? When I first met her, she was working at a coffee shop. Gave me free refills. Such a small thing, but the way she looked at me, she noticed me. Made me feel like I accomplished something. It might not make sense, but it's all I got. Hey, you know, I guess you got your priorities straight. Let's kill this fool. Honestly, I could do this all night. Holy shit! He's alive? I think you're starting to like it, kid. I don't think like's the right word. Appreciate it. Whatever. Am I high? I'm ready. I believe you are. Now you've got 24 hours to bring Sofia back before I drag you down with me. And one other thing, you are in human flesh. Remember that. Meaning what? I thought I was dead. Yes and no. You can't die, but pain is still pain. You are bound by certain human limitations, which means you will slow down. And you will need to refuel and recharge. I'll have to eat? Yes, and not normal food. Blood, human blood. It's the closest thing to a soul's physical essence. Who's there? They won't know what hit 'em, kid. [cackling] I get it. I gotta eat. What are we gonna do with you, Horse? Attaboy! Welcome home! Take her to an upstairs bedroom. And give her a tea or something and lock the door. I'll be missed! People will look for me, Angel. Well, they won't find you. You're disgusting. Tomorrow afternoon, we'll prep you for your big trip. So get some rest. And if you need help getting some sleep, maybe I can give you something. Please, you don't have to do this. You can let me go. I'll tell the cops you had nothing to do with this. Not my problem. Please, he's crazy. He's going to kill me. Not. My. Problem. You hungry? Thirsty? No. Okay. Wait! No! No! Please don't do this! Please! [sobs] [shouts] [screams] What happened to you? You're not gonna believe it. I'm a little shook. Okay. So now that we're unshaken, what happened? That kid, Brandon. He's alive. And you stopped that from being true, right? He's dead! I mean, he's alive! I mean, it's one of those two! What are you talking about? Like I said, he's back, but he's not normal. He's got a flaming pumpkin on his head and a claw that does crazy shit! Speaking of crazy... I know it sounds nuts! But he sold his soul to the devil. I saw him talking to this old guy. He said he has 24 hours to save Sofia before he drags him to hell. - Wow. - Right? Are you high right now? No! No. You know I don't use anymore! I mean, socially, yes, but not on a daily. I'm clean-ish! Clean-ish! Regardless, I'm not high right now! So boyfriend guy sold his soul to the devil. And he's coming to kick our ass. Hmm. Keep it. Get some rest. My treat. - Where are you going? - Off to the office. Gotta prep for our new mule's travel arrangements. You don't believe me. Don't believe me. Excuse me. S'up? You, uh... You lookin' for somethin'? No. I was hoping you boys can help me. Been driving around all night wasting my time. So now you've decided to waste mine! Why don't you just keep drivin', pal? I'm looking for Angel. Well, we ain't hiring. We've business to discuss. Now somethin' about you doesn't sit right with me. That's a damn shame. Bro, walk off. Step away. Yeah. Shouldn't you be like at a magician's ball or a masquerade party? Yeah. Where's your little rabbit, huh? Why don't we make him disappear? You know? Dead. Why don't you guys help me find Angel and I'll let you get a new line of work? Dude, walk away! You wouldn't be the first idiot we cap in broad daylight. I mean, you know, my man's connected, right? Cops ain't a thing around here. Just looking for Angel. He ain't around here, pal. Try the library. So you're gonna force me to convince you, huh? What are you gonna do about it? Go ahead. Convince us. What are you, man? The last thing you'll see alive. Where's Angel? Listen, man. You don't wanna go to war with Angel. He doesn't give up easy, man! Same here! Now where is he and where did he take Sofia? I don't know who Sofia is, but I sure hope she's worth it. She is. If you want the boss, he'll be at the factory. He's almost always there. It's like a secret base. The cops don't even touch it. How do I get there? Next town over in Candlewood. It's on the corner of, uh... Crimswell... Crimswell and Hamlin! Made shoes or some crap there. See? Being helpful is easy. You're 100% right. Eat shit! [grunts] [groans] [laughing] Gracias, Javier. You'll love her. Yeah. Hasta luego, amigo. You wanted to see me? Moira, come on in. If this is about the Panama situation, we are still in limbo due to Customs. Panama can wait. It's fake ID time. The Feds are still sniffing around from last time. No. I hate the word no. I have an aversion to it. I understand that... Maybe it's from that time that I was ripping that guy's eyelids out. And he kept screaming, "No! No!" like it would make me stop! I know. I was there. You know, maybe I just burned out on the word. Besides, it's for a dear friend of mine. I'm sure it is, but... I need to tie up loose ends, Moira. Javier knows. I just called him. It's got to happen, Moira. It's going to take major cash to make that happen. You want the works? Passport, driver's license... You bet, and tonight. Oh, boy. I'm gonna call Luis. He's usually pretty good about this kind of stuff. Hello? [grunting] [groans] Gracias, Luis. Adios. Twenty. What? The last package was 10 large. Well, it's 20 grand for a rush job. He's giving us a deal. - For a just in case? - This is your just in case. He wouldn't budge. My guy is the guy. You know his quality work. I don't trust easily. As a matter of fact, I can count on one hand how many people I do trust. And you, Moira, are on that hand. If you screw me, I'd have to cut the finger off. Clear? Legit items are expensive items. And you're not skimming any off the top for yourself? Now would I do that to you? I knew the eyelids guy. [chuckling] Make it happen. But it's all gotta be in my hands by tonight. Done and done. How crowded is the border? Oh, the last report was there's roadkill all over Texas. But we are golden through Chula Vista. No checkpoints? Nope. They pulled up stakes a couple days ago, moved north. We could flow some dough while we're at it. No. No, I want a clean transport just in case. I wanna make sure this little lady gets there without any hassle. Yeah, her trouble happens later. Absolutely. [gagging] Oh, hell, no! What was that? Are you packing, Moira? No! You think it's a police raid? They wouldn't dare. [groaning] I'm out! Put it down! Yeah, right. No, no! Wait, wait! Wait, no, no! [screams] Oh, God. Where is Angel? Do not kill me! I'm not here for you! You just missed him. [grunts] Son of a bitch! You are alive. Where is Sofia? If I don't answer you, you're going to kill me, right? I'm gonna kill you anyway. Now where is she? Now if you kill me, you'll never find her. Tell me where she is and I'll make this painless. I used to say that to people too, but death is never painless. So don't try and make me feel better. You brought this on yourself, now where... where is she? [groaning] Well, I'd love to stay and chat. But something tells me you're not gonna stay down for long. Moira, I suggest you find an exit. Oh... Oh, please don't kill me! I'm not a bad guy. I'm not supposed to die like this! Tell me where Sofia is! I don't know her! Okay. Where does he live? Tell me that. Angel? He lives way, way out of town. And I don't even know if he's going home right now. Where could he be headed? I don't know! Like I told you, he doesn't tell me anything. This is a kind of a need to know business! Okay. Now is where I ask for his address again. I can't tell you that. Then you must not value your life. It's client confidentiality. 7875 Candle Ave. Got you! I'll be back in a few to give you something real nice. It'll help you sleep. And when you awake, you'll be in sunny Mexico. Eyes peeled! Be on high alert! You got it, boss. So... today was a little messy. Had a visit from an old friend. A dead one, actually. I told you. I seen some shit, but that was some shit! So on top of everything that we have to worry about, we have a new problem. This piece of trash sold his soul to the devil, which apparently is a real damn thing. And he's gunning for me and he's gunning for you! I'm next! You're next! You're next! We're all next! And this Brandon guy is 100% fairly unstoppable... at the moment. Brandon? Fleck... you said something about 24 hours. That's what I heard. That's as long as he said Brandon had before he dragged him to hell. So, time is running short for him, right? So it's just a game of keep-away, really. No. No! Let's just wait it out. Hunker down here. Let's Alamo his ass. Even if he comes here, I don't have enough bodies to throw at him. No offense, fellas, but that's what you're paid for. Holy ground. Devil dealers aren't allowed on holy ground, right? I have no idea. It's worth a shot. I'm coming, Brandon. Whoa, whoa, whoa. How'd you get outta your room? [grunts] [whispers] Sorry. [whistles] [grunts] Someplace ridiculously far away! Someplace holy! A church or something! - Boss? - Yes! The girl got away! You're kidding! Brandon's here? - Who? - Never mind! Find her! Go! Go! Go! Go, Fleck. Hey! We need to talk. Back away. Pretend you didn't see me. Put in a good word with your guy for me, huh? I mean, I know I'm going to hell, but I'm in no rush. What are you talking about? If I let you go, maybe he'll go easy on me. Bygones and shit. Screw you! Really? The safety's on! How are we supposed to cooperate if we can't see eye to eye? I'm trying to be nice here! Anything over here? Hey! I found her! [whistles] I'm not going to let you send me to Mexico. Not sure if you knew. I'll do it again. And I bet you'll make it stick this time. I regret I ever felt that way. But an upper hand is an upper hand. But Brandon's alive. I heard you. Well, I wouldn't say alive exactly. I also wouldn't say all the way dead either. Then he'll come for me. If he's alive, he'll look for me. I'm counting on it. What do you mean? There's a cathedral in Woodsboro. It's perfect. Woodsboro's like four hours from here. Oh, yeah, real out of the way. It's a haul, so it will eat up his time. Speaking of which, stash her in my trunk. We're leaving. What if he doesn't show? He'll show. Where's Sofia? Dinner table! Boss left you a note. [motorcycle engine roars] Rise and shine, Sofia! Nice night, isn't it? What are we doing out here? Waiting for your one true love. What else? He's coming here? If he wants you back, yes. And when he does, we're ready for him. But no job is too immense when you have confidence. What happened to us? You were into me once, right? Think we could give it another go? I am very forgiving for the most part. I get it! I tried to kill you! Fair point. Jessica Lewis happened to us. Who's that? She was my best friend. She got hooked. Someone sold her bad shit and she died. She was 17! Then I found out it was you that sold her that shit! I despised you. I wanted you dead. I wanted me dead. Maybe I could have saved her. For what it's worth, I am human. I loved you and you hurt me. I wouldn't have gone through all this trouble if I wasn't hurt. Naturally, I'm bitter, so I guess we're even. [spits] If that's the best you got, then I pity you. - You're evil! - It helps! I wasn't bluffing! I'll kill myself before you send me anywhere! Hm, well, that would be an utterly shocking waste. Luckily, we traffic in cadavers for medical schools that don't ask questions. Now, sit back and relax. His time's almost up. His time for what? Time's almost up, Brandon. I figured you'd show up. You don't think I'd miss the grand finale? You do know this is a trap? Figured they'd play dirty. Yeah, well, there's a lot about all this that isn't exactly kosher. What happens to Sofia when I'm gone? Well, if you clear the deck as in all the guys that wanna pack her off to Mexico, I suppose she gets on with her life, grows old and dies happy and fulfilled. Good enough. See you soon, kid. They're around the back. Waiting for you. Hey! There he is! This guy damned his soul for you, you know? Oh my God, Brandon! Not God. Not exactly. You okay? Did he hurt you? Are you okay? That's far enough, lover boy. Was it all worth it, Angel? I mean, wouldn't you say she's worth it? I mean, you did sell your damn soul to the devil for her, right? Too many people have died. Just let her go, please, okay? Give me your word she'll be safe, I'll back off. I don't believe you. You have my word. You're gonna have to trust me. Hm, and if I do that, if I let her go right now and you go back to wherever it is you're going to, how can you trust me to keep my promise that I won't go after her again? Just gonna have to trust you. Saying that out loud, it doesn't seem like a good idea. No, it's a brilliant idea. Let's try it. What happened to you? I don't know where to begin. Are you... dead? Did you really do what he says you did? Why did you do that? - Sofia... - It should be obvious. I don't have time for this. Ah! [Angel laughs] Oh, what's the matter? Did that hurt? What is this? I mean, don't you get it? Instant holy ground! Just add holy water. No trespassing for you. Pretty good, huh? Must really burn you up to be so close, yet so far, far away. No, no, no, no! You're staying with me. You wouldn't shoot me, not after all this. I mean, I would. I'm unpredictable. Oh, my God, Bran! Fleck! The devil itself! Do it! Yes. What do you think you're doing? Hurry up, Father! Splash him! In the name of the Father and of the Son... - No! Stop! - Quiet! It's just getting good! And the Holy Spirit, I command you to leave this man! Whoa, holy water is no joke! Dear God, merciful God! Brandon? You're a monster! Me? Look at him! He's got a burning pumpkin head! I'm the normal one here! Brandon, can you hear me? I'm sorry, Sofia. Look, I don't know when you made this little super powered agreement, but I'm guessing time's almost up for you. Jesus, Angel. Just let me go. You don't have to do any of this! What? No. Angel! I'm not finished yet! Famous last words! In case you haven't noticed, it's over. I win. [rumbling] Whoa! Sounds like that's for you. Brandon! Time's up, friend. Brandon! What's happening? I love you. I love you, Brandon. Take these. She won't have need for those. I'll love you forever. [screams] No! Brandon! No! No! [cackling] You don't see that every day. Fleck, did you see that? Oh, I saw it. Merciful God... Oh, what's the matter? You never seen an ex-boyfriend dragged back to hell before? Get away from me! Cheer up. You two would have never lasted anyway. Father, thank you for your help. He... he was possessed. Yeah, something like that. Don't look so surprised, Father. Don't they prepare you guys for stuff like this? I'd imagine it's Priest 101. I... I have to report this to the Monsignor. He... He has to know about this immediately. No, no, mum's the word. You understand? This needs to stay between us. Seal of the confessional and all that. You have to understand what I just witnessed doesn't happen too often. Frankly, I've never heard of anyone who's seen anything remotely like this. It's... It's huge. It's a big deal, I know. I understand. It's immense! It's unfathomable. Do you know what this could mean for the church? Father, do you know what this could mean if I get connected to something like this? Uh, I'd... I'd keep your name out of this. I'd keep my mouth shut about your involvement and your associate's involvement, too. Yeah. Well, you see, it is important, nay imperative that you keep your mouth shut about all of this. Can you do that? Look, Mr. Cregar... Like I keep saying... Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. No. We got a problem. What are you talking about? You gotta be kidding me! You weren't watching her! She was tied up. I'm one guy! I had to back you up with the priest! Did it look like I needed backup with the priest? Well, you never know! I'll find her! I know where she went. Where? To where it all began. The bridge? Because there's no way... Gather the boys! The ones that are alive, double their pay if they survive. And toss the priest. Are you here? I wanna make a deal just like Brandon! Please, if you're there, I'm willing to give all that I have! Please! Please! Please, are you there? Why so sad? He gave his life for me. Now I wanna do the same. Love makes humans fools. I do love him. He doesn't deserve to die like that. And you do? Make no mistake, young lady. That is what you're asking me, or am I mistaken? You're not. I see what Brandon sees in you. You wear guts well. You're... Oh, yeah. You can feel it. I know you can feel it. But you mentioned something about giving your life. A trade. A trade? You know, I don't normally like to trade. But exchanging his soul for your ivory pure one, that would be a bargain, wouldn't it? The men that took me... They're still alive, I know. And they're coming here now. They were promised to me. You'll have them. You'll deliver them? Now I know why Brandon loves you. But once the coast is clear, you're staying with me. No ifs, ands or buts about it. You understand the terms of the agreement? Yes. On the condition that he returns with no obligation to you. Promise. You accept my gift? Your gift? I accept. Why would she come back here? It's where I would go. I think she went to the cops. This is beyond cops, Fleck. She could be anywhere. No. She's on that bridge. Listen up! Get the girl and take her alive. She's merchandise, so treat her nice. No rough stuff... unless you have to be convincing. Vamonos! Hey! Where'd you go? Sofia? Oh, my God! You're back! Where am I? Did we win? What does that mean? I brought you back. You brought me back? Wait... Wait, wait. We're back on the bridge. What did you do? What I had to. No, you shouldn't have done that! What else was I supposed to do? When I said I'd love you forever, I meant it. Same. Look, this is all my fault. I'm so sorry. You did nothing wrong, okay, except talking to him. I had no other choice. Angel and his guys are on their way here right now. But they don't know what's coming for them. Now how do I work this thing so I can kick their ass? At this point, I think we should just kill her. She's become too much of a problem. You guys go on up ahead. What's the matter? You want us to go first? Oh, I could hold your hand if you're scared. So who'd you say we were looking for? Sofia. Well, she ain't here. Uh, okay. Screw this! Fine. Keep it. Consider it a gift. Let me be the first to apologize. I know things went too far and for that, I'm sorry. Too late. Get up... slowly. No metal hand tells me bullets might mean more to you now. Walk in front of me. Don't be stupid. You run, I shoot. Please! You don't want me. Let's make a deal. I get you Angel. And in exchange, you let me walk outta here. - What are you doing? - Squashing a flea. No. No! I don't deserve this! Please! [neck cracks] He snuck up on me. Let him go! I mean, I'm not gonna do that. You keep making the wrong choices. You know you're gonna die, right? I've accepted that outcome. It was all supposed to be so simple! Don't do it! You know what they say. If you can't beat 'em, take 'em with you. Ah! [grunts] You broke my heart. Get over it! Not bad! Had a good teacher. You're right about this thing. MVP of the night. No! In a way... I... still... win. Sofia? It's okay, I'm okay. I've been through this a few times. Hurts like hell, right? Don't worry. You'll bounce right back up. But you'll need to feed, right? You won't want to, but you'll need to. It hurts! I can get Angel and... No. Stay with me. Be with me. Hold my hand. Could you love me forever? And ever. You weren't dead. What did you promise him to bring me back? Oh, no, no, you didn't! Brandon... No! Don't take her! She doesn't deserve this! Bran, please... Don't you take her from me! I don't want you to go. I'm so sorry. It's okay. You're worth it. No! No! Sofia, no! How could you take her from me? How could you? Hey! I know you can hear me! Bring her back! Please don't do this! She's gone. Bring her back. - A deal's a deal. - It's not fair. I'm always fair. It was her choice. She's gone, you're here. Debts paid. No. No, I can't accept that. There must be something I can do. It's always possible, but don't you think you've done enough? Remember, she gave up her life on your behalf. Be a good man. Live a good life. Earn her sacrifice. I wanna make a new deal. Kid, listen. Walk away. Be selfish. You know what you could do? Dedicate a park bench in her name, something like that. Just be done with it. I just want her back. Doesn't work like that. There's tit for tat. I want, you want. I get, you get. I understand, okay? There must be something I can give. I just want her back. Please. I knew I was right about you two. What does that mean? I knew if I got Sofia under contract, I wouldn't have both of you. Now hold on, hold on. I didn't pull anything tricky. She came calling. You didn't have to accept her deal. Why wouldn't I? Okay, let's fix it! Fix it? All right, let me think, let me think. Now you proved that you're a man of your word. But you're used goods. Your soul is filthy. You're useless. But I have worked with worse. Sure, you have. Well, every tool has its use, no matter how rusted. Name it! If not my soul, then what? Oh, no, no, no. Your soul is included. I just have to figure out how to amend our original agreement. Would you consider killing again... for me? I hated it. Kid, it's for Sofia, the girl who made you feel seen, the girl who completed you... Sofia. For her, I would. I have. So, yes. That's a beautiful thing, kid. I get, you get. In exchange for Sofia's life. Deal. Now let's go paint the town... red. [laughs]
