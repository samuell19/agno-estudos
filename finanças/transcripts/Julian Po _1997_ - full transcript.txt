THIS IS THE STORY OF MY TRIP TO THE SEA. OF ALL THE PLACES I'VE NEVER BEEN, IT'S THE ONE THAT I LOVE THE MOST. NO, NO, NO. THAT DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT. WHO'S GOING TO HEAR THIS ANYWAY?

NAME COULD BE AN ALIAS, AND I GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THAT BOY. I'LL STICK TO HIM LIKE MUD. Woman: HE COULD BE A TERRORIST, YOU KNOW. I WONDER IF HE'S UP THERE MAKING BOMBS OR SOMETHING. Po, on tape recorder: ALL MY LIFE, I WANTED TO SEE THE OCEAN. JUST CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LOOK OUT AND SEE ALL THE WAY TO THE HORIZON. PROBABLY MAKES A MAN WANT TO LIVE FOREVER TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. MAKE ME FEEL SMALL... BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN. WASN'T LIKE I DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME. THERE WAS ALWAYS TIME... BUT I ALWAYS HAD LITTLE DETAILS TO WORK OUT FIRST... ERRANDS TO RUN... BATHROOM SCALE'S BROKEN... THIS TIME, I'M GOING THROUGH WITH IT. [THUD] I COULD HAVE BEEN THERE BY NOW, WITH A LITTLE LUCK.

IT'S JUST THAT'S HOW I AM. I DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO BE ANONYMOUS HERE. [PO STRUGGLING WITH LUGGAGE] MAYBE I'LL STAY ANOTHER DAY OR TWO, SEE THE SIGHTS. YEAH. WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT, MR. PO? Woman: WHO IS HE? LEON THINKS HE'S A DRUG DEALER. DRUG DEALER? OH, MY GOD. WELL, HE'S IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR THAT. NOBODY AROUND HERE WANTS TO HAVE ANY KIND OF FUN, MUCH LESS ILLEGAL FUN. AT LEAST, ALMOST NO ONE. [MUTTERING] OH! WHY DOES EVERYBODY IN THIS TOWN LOOK AT ME? WHAT, AM I SOME KIND OF FREAK? I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE JUST GOING TO SPRAY YOUR DUMB TOMATOES. YOU HAVE AN OBVIOUS FELON IN YOUR TOWN, HENRY. YOU ACT LIKE NOTHING'S HAPPENING. WELL, ACTUALLY, SUGAR, NOTHING IS HAPPENING. YET. HE COULD BE RIGHT OUTSIDE THAT BARN LOOKING AT US.

MUST BE SOMETHING IN THE WATER AROUND HERE MAKES EVERYONE A MORON. [SIGHS] Lilah: VERN TOLD ME HE SITS IN HIS ROOM AND TALKS TO HIMSELF. Leon: MM-HMM. SAID THE SAME THING TO ME.

NOW, IF YOU BRINGING DRUGS IN HERE, YOU COME TO THE WRONG PLACE. DRUGS. I DON'T, UH, I DON'T HAVE ANY DRUGS. YOU GOT THE LOOK OF A MAN ON THE RUN. I'M A BOOKKEEPER. DID HE SAY HE WAS A BOOKIE? YOU A KILLER, BOY? COULD BE ONE OF THOSE MASS MURDERERS. HE PROBABLY KILLED A WHOLE BUNCH OF INNOCENT WOMEN SOMEWHERE, THEN YOU CAME HERE TO KILL AGAIN. WHY DID YOU COME HERE? Po: MY CAR BROKE DOWN. I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE SEASHORE FOR VACATION. WASN'T NO BROKE-DOWN CAR ON THE ROAD NOWHERE. I SWEAR. LET ME SEE YOUR CAR KEYS. Po: I THREW THEM AWAY.

I DREAMED THAT I SAW YOU IN A FIELD, AND THE FIELD BECAME MY BEDROOM, AND YOU WERE STANDING BY MY BED HOLDING A BIG KNIFE. THEN SUDDENLY YOU STABBED YOURSELF IN THE CHEST WITH IT, AND...I WOKE UP, AND I KNEW YOU WERE THE MAN I'D BEEN WAITING FOR MY WHOLE LIFE. H-HOW DID YOU KNOW TO DREAM ABOUT ME? WE'VE NEVER MET. I SEE YOU. I SEE YOU EVERY DAY. AND I KNOW WHY YOU CAME HERE. YOU DO? YOU CAME HERE FOR ME. I DID? MY WHOLE LIFE, I'VE DREAMT OF SOMEONE LIKE YOU, AND THEN YOU CAME.

I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A BAKER. WELL, YOU SHOULD BE. WHY AREN'T YOU? I WAS GOING TO START A BAKERY OUT OF MY KITCHEN ONCE, BUT LEON WOULDN'T LET ME. HE'S SORT OF OLD-FASHIONED. HE SAID HE LOVED MY COOKING SO MUCH, HE COULDN'T STAND TO SHARE IT WITH ANYBODY. OH, BUT WHY AM I TALKING ABOUT THIS? YOUR TIME IS TOO SHORT TO BE WORRIED ABOUT MY PROBLEMS. EVERYONE'S TIME IS SHORT. YOURS, TOO. IT'S AN ILLUSION THAT WE HAVE FOREVER TO LIVE. MY GOD. THAT IS SO TRUE. WE ALWAYS WAIT TOO LONG TO DO THE THINGS WE WANT TO DO, AND THEN, BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, IT'S TOO LATE. YOU ARE SO RIGHT. [KNOCK ON DOOR] HI. UH, SHE, UH, BROUGHT ME THOSE FOR BREAKFAST. THAT'S WHY SHE WAS HERE. I LIKED YOUR BREAKFAST, TOO. IT WAS DELICIOUS. VERY GOOD, TASTY. I'M GOING TO GO OUT NOW. SEE YOU. AHEM. BYE. [DOOR CLOSES] [KITTEN MEOWING] IS THIS YOURS? THANK YOU, MR. PO. IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU TODAY. HELLO. IT'S NOT THE WAY I'D DO IT. BEG YOUR PARDON?

WE'LL HAVE YOU FIXED UP IN A JIFFY. WELL, I WAS-- NO, RIGHT THIS WAY. THANK YOU, MARY. STEP RIGHT HERE, SIR. PEOPLE IN YOUR POSITION OFTEN DON'T THINK ABOUT A HAIRCUT, MR. PO, UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE. I'VE SEEN IT A MILLION TIMES. THE LAST HAIRCUT OF YOUR EARTHLY EXISTENCE DONE BY THE UNDERTAKER. IS HE A TRAINED HAIR-CARE PROFESSIONAL, MR. PO? I ASK YOU. HE IS NOT.

WE JUST MET. YOU'RE NOT AN ORDINARY MAN, MR. PO. YOU HAVE IDEALS AND WILLPOWER. I'M JUST A LITTLE MAN. I'LL NEVER TAKE LIFE BY THE THROAT AND SAY, "YOU GIVE ME THIS, OR ELSE..." BUT YOU DID. I WANT YOU TO WEAR MY SUIT, MR. PO. I WANT TO BE PART OF YOUR ADVENTURE. Po, voice-over: THERE'S SOMETHING HAPPENING TO ME THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. AN EVENT... AN EVENT IS HAPPENING TO ME...

LUCY. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING. THANK YOU FOR CLEANING MY ROOM. I'M GRATEFUL. Po: WONDER IF THIS RIVER GOES OUT TO THE SEA. WHO KNOWS? SARAH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I FOLLOWED YOU. WHY? YOU WANTED TO SEE ME JUMP, JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE? I'M NOT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. I WOULD HAVE JOINED YOU. WHY? I USED TO COME OUT TO THIS BRIDGE, AND I'D STAY ALL NIGHT SOMETIMES, JUST THINKING ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT SCARE ME. EVERYTHING SCARES ME-- WORDS, TALKING... YOU SAY THINGS, AND THEY COME OUT WRONG, SO YOU SAY MORE THINGS, AND... THEN YOU JUST GET STUCK... THEN YOU GOT TO GET OUT. HE DIED WHEN I WAS 5. ALL I REMEMBER IS HIS MUSTACHE AND THAT HE ALWAYS USED TO CARRY CHEWING GUM WITH HIM, AND HE'D GIVE ME A STICK AND CALL ME HIS LITTLE PRINCESS. YOU MISS HIM? NO, BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS WITH ME. THE ONLY THING IS I CAN'T TOUCH HIM UNTIL I GO WHERE HE IS. I MISS TOUCHING HIS MUSTACHE. HOW DID HE DIE? LIKE US. COME ON, JULIAN. DOES IT FIT? TRY IT ON. I MADE IT FOR YOU. MADE IT FOR ME? WHEN? WE JUST MET. I MADE THAT ONE LAST YEAR. OTHERS I MADE BEFORE. THAT'S PERFECT. HOW DID YOU KNOW THE SIZE I WOULD BE? WELL, I DIDN'T ALWAYS. I MADE THIS ONE WHEN I WAS 16. GUESS I THOUGHT YOU'D BE BIGGER THEN. Po, voice-over: MET SARAH AGAIN. WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT HER? SHE'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN I'VE EVER SEEN. SHE LOVES ME.

DON'T GET THE SAME MESS YOU GET WITH A GUN. YEAH, BUT YOU MIGHT NOT TAKE ENOUGH, AND THE NEXT MORNING, YOU JUST WAKE UP WITH A GOD-AWFUL HANGOVER. I HEAR SLITTING THE WRIST IS PRETTY EFFECTIVE, BUT YOU GOT TO DO IT THE LONG WAY, SEE? A LOT OF FOLKS JUST DO IT CROSSWISE. THE BLOOD DON'T COME FAST ENOUGH. THAT'S, UH... THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A REMARKABLE MAN, MR. PO. I AM? ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, YOU DECIDE ON A THING, YOU GO FOR IT. I LIKE YOUR STYLE. HAVE ANOTHER BEER, MR. PO. NO, THIS ONE'S ON ME, STONEWALL.

ONE OF THE DEEPEST PLEASURES A MAN CAN FEEL-- KILLING AND SEX. YOU EVER KILL ANYTHING, PO? UH...BUGS. THAT PERFECT MOMENT... WHEN AN ANIMAL LEAPS IN THE AIR... ALL THE MUSCLES TENSE IN A LAST EFFORT TO LIVE. THEN IT FALLS, THE LIFE GONE BEFORE IT HITS THE GROUND. MOMENT OF...ECSTASY. I KILLED A MAN ONCE. NOBODY EVER KNEW. IT WAS JUST LIKE SHOOTING A RABBIT, EXCEPT IT WAS A MAN. THE WORST... GREATEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE. IT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO, AIN'T IT? ONLY YOU'RE THE HUNTER AND THE RABBIT. I ADMIRE YOU. NOW, YOU DON'T THINK KILLING'S A SIN, DO YOU? SIN? NO. UH... IF YOU KILL A MAN, YOU SET HIM FREE. IT'S NOT A SIN. IT'S A FAVOR. BY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT. WE BOTH NEED TO KILL. PO...

WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE? MY NEW CAREER. YOUR NEW WHAT? YOU TELL HIM, MR. PO. TELL ME WHAT? UH, I DON'T KNOW. SURE YOU DO. MR. PO HERE SAID, IT IS AN ILLUSION THAT WE LIVE FOREVER, AND IF WE WAIT TOO LONG TO DO THE THINGS WE REALLY WANT TO DO, WE MAY BE TOO LATE. NOW, I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A BAKER, AND IF I WAIT ANY LONGER, HELL, I MIGHT BE DEAD, LIKE MR. PO HERE, SO A BAKER IS WHAT I'M GOING TO BE. THIS WAS YOUR IDEA? I OWE IT ALL TO HIM. [HUMMING] WHAT ABOUT THESE? Woman: LET'S GO. Woman: GOOD LUCK. Man: THANK YOU. BUY A TICKET, YOUNG FELLA? GUESS THE DAY AND WIN THE POT. WHAT DAY? THE DAY THE STRANGER DOES HISSELF IN.

WHY ARE YOU GUYS FOLLOWING ME, WALTER? TO SEE WHEN YOU DO IT. YOU WANT TO SEE ME KILL MYSELF? WHY? 'CAUSE WE AIN'T NEVER SEEN NOBODY KILL HIMSELF BEFORE. YOU JUST BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE RAFFLE TICKETS, DIDN'T YOU? FOR WHAT DAY? TODAY. WELL, YOU JUST WASTED A DOLLAR. I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT TODAY. DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME? I SAID I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT TODAY. WHY ARE YOU GUYS STILL FOLLOWING ME? Walter: A GUY WHO'D KILL HIMSELF MIGHT LIE. MR. PO, I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU. IT'S NOT TODAY, IS IT? NO. I SEE YOU'VE MADE FRIENDS WITH SOME OF OUR YOUNGER CITIZENS. WELL, THEY BET A DOLLAR I'D DIE TODAY. BOYS WILL BE BOYS, BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT-- DEATH AND SO FORTH. I MEAN, WHAT IS IT, EXACTLY, THAT YOU EXPECT TO FIND THERE? WHERE? HEAVEN. YOU DO BELIEVE IN HEAVEN, MR. PO, DON'T YOU? I DON'T KNOW. ME, TOO. I OFTEN WONDER WHAT EXISTS, AND SOMETHING MUST, DON'T YOU THINK? IF IT WERE JUST THE END, IT WOULD BE TOO TERRIBLE. YOU KNOW, IN SUNDAY SCHOOL, WE TEACH THAT HEAVEN IS A KIND OF A PICNIC IN THE COUNTRY WITH THE CHOIR SINGING ALL THE TIME, BUT SUPPOSE IT'S MORE LIKE A CITY OR THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN OR A CAVE OR LIKE BEING A BIRD, ALWAYS FLYING AROUND ALONE ABOVE EVERYTHING. WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'LL END UP? UH, I DON'T KNOW, BUT, UH... PROBABLY GET WHAT YOU DIDN'T GET HERE, WHAT YOU WANTED AND YOU DIDN'T GET. IF YOU WANTED A CHURCH CHOIR IN THE COUNTRY, YOU GET THAT. IF YOU WANTED SOMETHING ELSE, YOU GET THAT. I THINK GOD-- IF THERE EVEN IS A GOD-- HAS A LOT TO APOLOGIZE FOR, AND HE DOES IT IN HEAVEN. AND IF HE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE APOLOGIZING, THEN YOU'RE IN HELL. I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY. SO, AT LEAST YOU DO BELIEVE IN GOD. WELL, SOMEBODY HAS TO APOLOGIZE. EXCUSE ME. Lilah: MR. PO. JULIAN. I THOUGHT WE MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE DRIVE IN THE COUNTRY. I PACKED A LUNCH. OH, I GOT TO GET OUT OF THIS TOWN... TAKE SARAH WITH ME. SAID SHE'S BEEN WAITING HER WHOLE LIFE FOR ME. MAYBE I'M THE ONE WHO'S BEEN WAITING MY WHOLE LIFE FOR HER. Po, voice-over: IS THERE SUCH A THING AS FATE? THAT'S MY QUESTION... SORT OF. BECAUSE IF THERE IS, THEN MAYBE I HAVE ONE. MAYBE IT INVOLVES SARAH. SHE LOVES ME... BUT WHAT IF I'M NOT WHO SHE THINKS I AM? THERE'S NEVER BEEN A SIMPLE ANSWER IN MY LIFE... EVER. Emma: PICK YOUR DAY. PICK YOUR DAY, NOW. PICK YOUR DAY. HI, WALTER. YES, SIR. SO WHAT DAY DID YOU GUYS BET ON? TODAY. WE ALWAYS PICK TODAY. YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE MUCH, DO YOU? WE FIGURE IF WE PICK TODAY EVERY DAY, WE CAN'T LOSE. WOULD YOU GO AWAY, WALTER? NO. I MEAN AWAY. THIS IS AWAY. MR. PO. MR. PO, CAN I TALK TO YOU A MINUTE? I'M BOBBY. HEY, APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME HERE. I'M REAL BUSY RIGHT NOW. I HEAR THINGS IN MY BRAIN. I DON'T HAVE TO THINK OF THEM. I HEAR THEM, AND I WANT TO DO THEM. IF I DON'T DO SOMETHING BIG, I'M GOING TO EXPLODE. I'M GOING TO EXPLODE. YOU CAME HERE TO DIE. THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO HERE. YOU DON'T WANT TO LIVE. I WANT TO LIVE. I WANT TO BE A MOVIE STAR. WHAT? ARE YOU TALKING TO ME? ARE YOU TALKING TO ME? THAT'S EASY, MAN. I CAN DO THAT SHIT. NOW, I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO. WHAT SHOULD I DO, MR. PO? I HAVE NO IDEA. YOU WANT TO BE A MOVIE STAR? GO AND DO IT. LIFE'S TOO SHORT. WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE ANYWAY. DON'T TALK ABOUT IT, JUST DO IT. LISTEN, YOU KNOW, I'M MAKING A NEW RULE. OK? FROM NOW ON, YOU GUYS STAY 10 PACES BEHIND ME, YOU GOT IT? OK? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... AND NO CLOSER THAN THIS. YOU GOT IT? Walter: YES, SIR. I JUST WANT A LITTLE PRIVACY. THAT'S ALL. [KNOCK ON DOOR] HELLO. HI. COME IN. THANK YOU. SO WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? I KNOW HOW YOU'VE SUFFERED. I CAN TELL. I KNOW A WOMAN HURT YOU AND THAT'S WHY YOU WANT TO KILL YOURSELF. WOMEN CAN BE HORRIBLE, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I AM NOT LIKE THAT. I WANT TO HELP YOU. YOU DO? I'D DO ANYTHING TO GIVE YOU COMFORT, MR. PO. YOU WOULD? YES, I WOULD. UM...ANYTHING? ANYTHING, MR. PO. WELL, TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT. I BEG YOUR PARDON? WELL, YOU SAID YOU'D DO ANYTHING. YOUR, UH, YOUR SKIRT. ALL RIGHT. UM... SHOULD I DO ANYTHING ELSE? NO. OK. THANK YOU FOR COMING. IS THAT ALL? YES. THANK YOU. [HUMMING] WHOA, MR. PO. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT LITTLE GUN I GAVE YOU. FIND OUT HOW BIG A PIECE YOU WANT. HELL, YOU MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT THE WHOLE GODDAMN SUBJECT ENTIRELY. IT'S A VERY NICE GUN. THANK YOU. MAN'S GOT TO CHOOSE HIS OWN GODDAMN WEAPON. I CAN SEE YOU ARE IMPRESSED. PIECE RIGHT HERE MIGHT BE THE RIGHT ACTION FOR YOU. THAT'S A WINCHESTER... LITTLE RIFLE THAT WON THE WEST. IT'S IN PERFECT WORKING ORDER. I BROUGHT DOWN A BUCK WITH THIS SUCKER ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO. NOW, THE IDEA I HAVE IS YOU JUST PUT THIS IN YOUR MOUTH LIKE THIS, SEE, AND YOU PUT YOUR BIG TOE ON THE TRIGGER... BOOM! BINGO. GOOD-BYE. [DOOR CLOSES] TERRIBLE. MAYBE YOU'RE A HANDGUN MAN AFTER ALL. CLARISSE, THERE HE IS NOW. MR. PO! MR. PO! HANG ON A FEW MORE DAYS. MAKE ME A RICH WOMAN. COME ON. [BELLS ON DOOR RING] GOOD AFTERNOON, MR. PO. AFTERNOON. LISTEN, I NEED A TIE. AH. WELL, I HAVE LOTS OF TIES. GREAT. OVER HERE. YOU EVER MARRIED, MR. PO? ME? NO. ME NEITHER. EVER IN LOVE? YES. IT'S WONDERFUL, ISN'T IT? WONDERFUL AND HORRIBLE AT THE SAME TIME, HORRIBLE IF YOU CAN'T BE WITH THE PERSON YOU LOVE. I SUPPOSE. THAT'S... THAT'S MY SITUATION, SEE, NEVER TO BE WITH THE PERSON I LOVE. WHY IS THAT? WELL... FATE. SUCH A TERRIBLE WORD. IT'S LIKE A PRISON, SOMETHING YOU'RE BORN WITH THAT YOU CAN'T CHANGE THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE EVER TO BE HAPPY. MY FATE IS NEVER TO BE WITH THE PERSON I LOVE. WHO DO YOU LOVE? LEON. WHO? LEON... THE SHERIFF. I'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM SINCE WE WERE KIDS. I NEVER TOLD ANYONE. WELL, DOES LEON FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU? HOW WOULD I KNOW? I COULDN'T POSSIBLY ASK. HE'S MARRIED. IF ANYONE FOUND OUT, MY LIFE WOULD BE OVER. WHAT CAN I DO? A LOT OF THINGS I REGRET, BUT NOTHING MORE THAN THE THINGS I WAS TOO SCARED TO DO. LIFE'S TOO SHORT TO LIVE IN FEAR, MR. POTTER. NAH. IT'S A PRESENT. THANK YOU. BOBBY LEFT ME. WHO'S BOBBY? MY HUSBAND. YOU TOLD HIM TO LEAVE ME, AND HE DID. HE SAID THAT YOU TOLD HIM THAT LIFE IS SHORT AND THAT HE SHOULD FOLLOW HIS DREAMS. HE MISUNDERSTOOD. I DIDN'T SAY ANY OF THAT. WHY DOES EVERYBODY IN THIS TOWN COME TO ME? WELL, BOBBY TRUSTED YOU. SO DO I. TELL ME WHAT TO DO. LISTEN, IT'S YOUR LIFE. I CAN'T LIVE IT FOR YOU. I'VE BEEN GIVING YOUR SITUATION A LOT OF THOUGHT, MR. PO, A LOT OF THOUGHT. HAVE YOU? FASCINATING. A MAN WANTS TO DO AWAY WITH HIMSELF, BUT HE DOESN'T JUST DO IT LIKE MOST PEOPLE. HE TRAVELS TO A PLACE HE'S NEVER BEEN, ANNOUNCES HIS PLANS, AND GOES ABOUT EVERYTHING IN A MOST DELIBERATE WAY. MAKES OF HIS SUICIDE A WORK OF ART. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. YOU THINK SO? DEFINITELY. I EVEN, IN MY SMALL WAY, IMAGINE THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP. WELL, HOW'S THAT? WELL, YOU SEE... I'M A KIND OF AN ARTIST, TOO... WITH THIS. MOST PEOPLE THINK I JUST CUT THE HAIR, SCRAPE OFF THE WHISKERS, BUT IT'S MORE THAN THAT TO ME. A FACE IS A CANVAS, AND THIS IS MY PAINTBRUSH. YOU KNOW... I NEVER SHAVED ANYONE WITHOUT IMAGINING WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO SLIT HIS THROAT, BUT EACH TIME I GET THE THOUGHT, MY HAND STARTS TO SHAKE. I GET SCARED. I GUESS I'M JUST NOT CUT OUT FOR MURDER, BUT WITH YOU, IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT. WOULDN'T BE MURDER AT ALL. WE'D BE COLLABORATING ON A WORK OF ART. I'D START JUST UNDER THE EAR HERE, THEN A QUICK SWEEP ACROSS TO THE ADAM'S APPLE. I GET THE EXTERIOR CAROTID AND JUGULAR THAT WAY, AND MAYBE ONE OF THE INTERIOR ONES. I LOOKED IT UP IN A MEDICAL BOOK. BE OVER IN HALF A SECOND. YOU WOULDN'T FEEL A THING. WHAT DO YOU THINK, MR. PO? JUST GIVE ME THE WORD. THANK YOU, JEAN. I TAKE MY TEXT TODAY... NOT FROM THIS BOOK... BUT FROM A MAN WHO LIVES AMONG US. HIS EXAMPLE CALLS US TO ASK... WHAT DO WE REALLY KNOW? DO WE KNOW WHO WE ARE... WHERE WE COME FROM... WHERE WE'RE GOING? WE THINK WE KNOW, BUT WE ONLY KNOW WHAT OTHERS TELL US AND WHAT WE FEEL IN OUR HEARTS, BUT OUR HEARTS LIE, SO WHAT DO WE KNOW? NOTHING. I DON'T WANT TO STAND HERE AND LECTURE YOU. I WANT TO SET YOU FREE. I REALIZED THIS WEEK THAT I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD. [CONGREGATION GASPS AND MURMURS] WHY WAIT FOR GOD TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS HORRIBLE MESS WE'VE MADE OF THINGS? HE MIGHT NOT WANT TO. HE MIGHT NOT BE THERE... [CONGREGATION GASPS] BUT WE'RE HERE. SO TODAY, MY FRIENDS... I WANT TO SAY I'M SORRY... FOR EVERYTHING. [BELLS RINGING] Bean: I'M SORRY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M SORRY. THANK YOU. YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. YOU'RE GOING STRAIGHT TO HELL. I'M SORRY. YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT, PASTOR BEAN? NEVER BETTER. I'M SORRY. YEAH? WELL, I SHOULD THINK YOU MIGHT BE. [SNIFFING] SARAH. WHAT, UH, WHAT'S THIS? WE'LL BE TOGETHER ALWAYS, WON'T WE? IT'S SO AMAZING TO ME THAT YOU EXIST. Sarah, voice-over: MY DARLING JULIAN, UNTIL YOU CAME INTO MY LIFE, I NEVER KNEW WHAT HAPPINESS WAS. I THOUGHT I MIGHT HAVE TO WALK IN THE SHADOWS OF THIS TOWN UNTIL A SAD OLD AGE. THEN YOU CAME FOR ME, AND EVERYTHING WAS SO CLEAR. LAST NIGHT, I SAW IN YOUR EYES WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO TELL ME, WHAT I KNEW ALREADY BUT COULDN'T SAY. I HEAR YOU... LIKE YOU'RE INSIDE MY HEAD... TELLING ME TO PROVE MY LOVE, TELLING ME TO GO FIRST. SO I'VE GONE AHEAD, MY DARLING JULIAN, AND I'LL WAIT FOR YOU ON THE OTHER, BETTER SIDE. ALL MY LOVE AND THANKS. FOREVER, SARAH. [FOOTSTEPS] Henry: OPEN UP, MR. PO. WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE. WE HAVE TO TALK, MR. PO. I'M BUSY. GO AWAY. AH, THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO IT. COME ON, LET US IN! Henry: WE TRUSTED YOU. WE MADE SACRIFICES FOR YOU. WE THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO KILL YOURSELF, AND WE FELT SORRY FOR YOU. YOU NEVER INTENDED TO DO IT. IT WAS A SCAM ALL ALONG, WASN'T IT? YOU MADE A DEAL, MR. PO. WE HONORED OUR SIDE OF THE DEAL. DEAL? I NEVER MADE ANY DEAL. THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE LOOK AT IT. WE THINK YOU MADE A PROMISE, AND WE THINK IT'S TIME YOU KEPT IT. YOU WANT ME TO DIE? WELL, YOU THE ONE WHO SAID HE WANTED TO KILL HIMSELF. WHAT, A GUY CAN'T CHANGE HIS MIND IN THIS TOWN? WELL, LITTLE SARAH CAN'T CHANGE HER MIND. THAT POOR LITTLE THING IS DEAD BECAUSE OF YOU. YOU OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL WE'RE GIVING YOU THE CHANCE TO SETTLE THINGS YOURSELF. DEAD BECAUSE OF ME? I WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THIS TOWN WHO EVER CARED ABOUT HER. YOU GUYS JUST WANT SOMEBODY TO BLAME. YOU'RE GOING TO KILL ME, AREN'T YOU? NO. WE AIN'T GONNA TOUCH YOU, SON. IT'S TIME, THAT'S ALL, TIME FOR YOU TO DO WHAT YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DO. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. YOU WANT ME TO KEEP MY WORD? I'LL KEEP IT. THAT'S THE SPIRIT, MR. PO. I WAS HOPING YOU'D DO THE RIGHT THING. I'LL DO IT TOMORROW. TOMORROW WILL BE FINE. I APPRECIATE YOU BEING REASONABLE ABOUT THIS, MR. PO. IT'S EASIER ON EVERYBODY THIS WAY. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Henry: MR. PO, IT'S TIME TO GO. COULDN'T ASK FOR NICER WEATHER. Po, voice-over: MY NAME IS JULIAN PO. IN 1967, I WAS BORN. OF LATE, I'VE BEEN HAVING A JOURNEY... I'VE FALLEN IN LOVE, I SEEM TO HAVE SERVED A PURPOSE, AND AFTER A BRIEF STOPOVER, I AM ONCE AGAIN ON MY WAY TO THE SEA. ALL IN ALL, I FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT MYSELF. Po's voice on tape recorder: THIS TOWN BEHAVES ACCORDING TO ITS WAYS, AND, WELL, THERE'S NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE. I'VE LEARNED THAT THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR FORGIVENESS, AND THIS--THAT ALL THE RIVERS RUN TO THE SEA, BUT THE SEA IS NOT YET FULL... OR SO I'VE BEEN LEAD TO BELIEVE.
