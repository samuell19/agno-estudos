We're good I've actually been seeing the same shrink since 2007. I didn't start dating the woman who's now my wife until 2012. My shrink's name is Barb, which I think we can all agree that's the perfect name for a shrink. And Barb's the best. Even though Barb is kind of the worst. Mostly because she's not necessarily good at it. You know? She's not good at actually being a doctor. When you're a doctor, there's all kinds of rules that go along with that. When I started with Barb, I was like "I don't think she knows that." But then very quickly I was like "Oh wait no she just doesn't give a shit man." She once spent a portion of the session sitting On the couch with me showing me pictures on an iPad of a house she bought in Mexico. That's also how she let me know that she was moving to Mexico. All of our sessions happen via Skype. Often times while she is lounging in a hammock. She has seen me in many shows over the year. She has come out to live shows. And that's very nice. It's very supportive. I get that. But there are these things called boundary issues. You don't want those being crossed. And she once, she once saw me in a show here in New York. And my parents also attended that show. And they lived near each other in New Jersey at the time And Barb asked my parents for a ride home And they gave it to her! If you're not familiar with how this type of doctor patient relationship is supposed to go, it's not supposed to end with your shrink and your parents alone in a car. But there's a reason I stayed with her as long as I have. It's been a decade! She can, she can be great. There's a lot of crazy stuff and you'll hear a lot of that, but she can be great. One time she says to me she goes, "You know what your basic problem is? Your reactions to things are not in proportion to the things you're reacting to." And that just Because that's very true about me. That has always been true. Really big things will happen in my life and I'll be like "Whatever, who cares?" And then these tiny little things And then these tiny little things will just spiral out of control. Like my wife, my wife's incredible. I think my wife is a perfect human being outside of one flaw. She does, she has one flaw. If she opens a cabinet door, that cabinet door stays open That is a fact. I don't even know if she's aware that they move in the other direction. And unfortunately for me, with my anxiety mixed with my slight OCD if a cabinet door is open and it doesn't have to be, that feels to me like the entire world is falling apart. And there's one night where she and I are in bed and I can't fall asleep because I know that in our kitchen there is a cabinet door and it is open. And I'm in my head and I'm going, "Who cares? Let it go. There are no negative repercussions to a cabinet door being open, right now And then I think to myself "You can't make that promise." And I'm going, "Don't do it It is crazy if you do it. But I do. I get out of bed and I tiptoe into our kitchen and I close the cabinet door And when I do, I say out loud, "It's over." Now clearly that does not deserve that reaction. Barb is on the money when it comes to this one. And maybe I should know that about myself. Maybe I should know that my reactions don't always make sense. I really didn't. And for her to tell me that in such a simple way, that's the type of wisdom that Barb drops every once in a while that makes it so worth it to stay with her. Even though she also says things like the time she told me that she believes that human brains are actually computers invented by aliens and placed inside our heads. My shrink told me that. She didn't just tell me that. She forgot she told me that and reiterated it 8 months later. So I bet for a lot of people, the big question is, why? Right? Like why do you have to see a shrink? That cabinet door thing isn't so bad. And it's not. It's also just the tip of the iceberg, unfortunately. I've been dealing with stuff more severe than that since a really young age. Um, I didn't know, I didn't when I was 11 years old that this thing had a name Depression. I just thought everybody in 5th grade had an internal monologue like the guy from Taxi Driver. It's very hard to verbally kind of describe what it feels like I bet anybody else who has dealt with it would agree that that's one of the very frustrating things about it. Um, I can say this. Even when I was little I knew I was never sure which version of myself I would wake up as on any given day Is today going to be a day where I'm really mad at everybody and I can't even explain why? Or today am I going to get really shy around people who I have known my whole life? Or, or maybe today I'll be really manic and try to convince the other kids in the neighborhood that we gotta get up on a garage and jump into ourb neighbor's pool. Or maybe today I'll be too scared to even leave the house because I've convinced myself that if I do, I might see the Virgin Mary and die like those Kids who saw her in Portugal a hundred years ago because I think we'll all agree that when you're born with mental illness level anxiety the cure is clearly being raised Catholic. Catholicism doesn't help anxiety. It's like this man's watching you Apologize for something. That's like, that's the whole religion. That's it. I didn't, I didn't see this stuff hit its peak level until I was 14 That's the first age where I had one of my attacks. And these attacks have played me ever since. Basically if my depression really gets going I kind of can't like grab on to my thoughts is how I might describe it. Uh, and I can't breathe. And my body is hot And my face numb Like actual pins and needles when its at its worst My face goes numb. It's awful. So, I bet the even bigger why is well, why does that happen? And I'm sorry to tell you, no real reason. I wish I wish I had one. I wish I had some inciting incident that I could point to and say, "That. That's what caused this in me." I don't have that. I was a pretty normal kid at the end of the day I loved basketball, John Starks. That's my dude, now and forever I loved Starks. I loved proâ€“wrestling The nature boy, Rick Flare. That's my guy. A couple other people. That's nice That's good I loved comic books But we can be honest. Marvel only. Come on. Thank you! DC comics are bullshit Always have been They have a character called the Blue Beetle Get the fuck out of here. That's not okay. And comedy was the big one for me When I'm 9, 10 years old, all I want to do is stay up late and watch Dave Letterman. And I start collecting Andy Huffman tapes When I'm still in high school And Saturday Night Live. When I was a kid, that's the best era of SNL. Chris Farley Living in a van down by the river! It's the best, you know So. Pretty average nerdy kid Interests And no real traumas to report at home. My parents are still in love and married after 40 years. Like, I don't know. I don't know what caused it. Like, I hate to say it, but sometimes people just break... Welcome to a comedy show. Welcome. So in 2001, I'm 21 years old and I find myself driving on Valley Road in Clifton, New Jersey. For anybody who's not familiar with Clifton, New Jersey this is a very long road It goes from one end of this town all the way to the other So even though it's just a regular suburban road people do drive fast on it. And I'm driving down in this pickup truck It's this big, beat up pickup the kind you'd see like a landscaping company use And I'm listening to The Smiths, who if you're not familiar The Smiths are a rock and role group They're from Manchester, England. Very popular in the early to mid 1980s Um, even if you don't know the Smiths you might know their front man He still tours around a lot. His name is Morrissey Like a very legendarily emotional Singer I am clearly trying to rip off his haircut right now. And I know I'm listening to The Smiths because when I'm 21 years old all I listen to is The Smiths. Because when you're 21 years old and you're as sad as I am a lot of the time, and you hear a lyric like If you're so funny, why are you on your own tonight? I know. Because tonight is just like any other night That's why you're on your own tonight. When you hear that, you're like, "Someone gets it." Someone just verbalized this thing I have always felt. There's one person in this world who understands me It's weird that it's Morrissey, but I'll take it. So I'm behind this pickup truck and the blinker turns on The driver's gonna turn left. I don't even slow down I'm going to pass him on the right. I come around him. And as I do so, I realize he's done one of those Like "Oh, that's not the turn I'm supposed to make." He's coming back into my lane. He's coming back into the right lane And it's very clear I'm in his blind spot He doesn't see me. And I think to myself "You should hit the breaks." And then I think, "No, don't Because this way it's just a car crash." And this way your parents don't have to go around Town being the parents of the kid who killed himself Because we don't judge people when they die in car crashes but we do judge people when they die of suicide. I think it's one of the strangest things we've given ourselves permission to do And ultimately, I think it's a branding problem Honestly. I do. I think suicide has a real branding problem. Because it has a tagline It has its own tagline and the tagline sucks It's very condescending. Suicide is the coward's way out. What a bad tagline. That's bad branding A tagline is supposed to get you pumped up you know. Like Nike. That's a good tagline. Just do it! Right? And I'm not saying that suicide should take that one that's not That's not at all really none of the big ones apply to this Although, Burger King "Have it your way" kind of does fit. Oddly oddly enough. And say this too. I've never understood it, the Phrase I don't get what's cowardly about suicide. To me, suicide means that someone had a lot of Problems and they couldn't fight through them anymore. That is a lot of things It's not cowardly So this truck hits me, sideswipes me sends my little Nissan Centre off into this little driveway. which Sounds like a safe place to end up. Except unfortunately for me this little section of Clifton, New Jersey is built on a hill So the driveway has a retaining wall. And I hit it head on. Car comes crashing down on the front lawn of this house And as soon the car stops bouncing, I think to myself "Oh my god. I did that." And then it's silence until I hear the sound of an aluminum front door squeaking open It's a very familiar sound for any of us who grew up in the suburbs. And then I hear this voice that has the same exact accent of my mother which is the same exact accent as Carmela Soprano. This is very true. And if there's any North Jersey people here tonight you can vouch for me A lot of people sound like Carmela Soprano where we grew up That's very true. I grew up in Essex County. That's where The Sopranos took place And they nailed the culture of it. And Edie Falco in particular she earned every award she ever won. And that's the real message of this show tonight. That's the real uncomfortable truth I wish we'd just speak more openly about is that is that Edie Falco pretty fucking good at acting. Quite good at what she does So this door squeaks open and then I hear this Carmela Soprano go, "Oh my god!" And then a second door squeaks open and I hear a second Carmela Soprano go "What's going on?" And then a third door opens and a third Carmela Soprano goes "Is he dead?" And the second one goes "We don't know." And the first one says, "We're trying to figure it out." So, I'm listening to this chorus of Carmela Sopranos debate whether or not I'm dead, and I'm in total shock inside the car I'm like, maybe I am. Maybe I'm dead right now. Maybe they know better than I do Maybe, maybe I'm dead and I'm a Ghost Maybe I'm the ghost of Clifton, New Jersey. Which could be worse. Could be Passaic Which if you knew, if you knew the geography of New Jersey, you'd be like "Nailed it bro!" I promise. You would, you would. I promise. So these Carmela Sopranos, they're discussing me, and I hear another voice Angry male voice. This guy says, "Get the fuck out of the car!" I realize this is the driver of the truck I hit He's coming towards me from the truck He's a big dude. He's jacked scary looking Not even because of the muscles because of his outfit. He's wearing a flannel shirt with the sleeves torn off And the shirt is tucked into a pair of daisy Dukes It's very disconcerting, very disconcerting. So he says, "Get the fuck out of the car!" I say, "I can't man The door, it's all caved in. It doesn't, it doesn't work anymore And he says, "I'm going to fuck you up." And he walks around the car And just before he gets to the passenger side door, another voice. North Jersey, Italianâ€“American male accent This guy sounds a lot like my best friend Anthony's dad. And, and this guy just goes, "Hey calm down, man Look at him. He's just a kid. Look at him, man. He's just a kid." And the big guy goes, "What!" and the Carmela Sopranos are just like "What's this new development?" Everybody's just trying to figure it out, you know. And the Italian guy says that a couple of more Times "He's just a kid, man. Come on He's just a kid." And to this day, I'm not sure why The big guy turns around gets back in his truck He just leaves. Gets out of there. He leaves the scene, never made sense to me. The Italian guy, he opens the passenger side door, gives me his hand I climb out of the car. He says, "You okay?" And I say, "Thanks, man. You saved me." And I've always felt bad about that Because there was a lot more to be said Like you saved me in that immediate sense but also you saved me because I did that. And I never ever thought that I could actually act on that impulse And now you're here. And you remind me of my best friend's dad Like you saved me.But I, I didn't even know how to formulate those thoughts let alone express them. So I just mumbled, "You saved me." And I will never forget how he responds. He puts his hand on my shoulder and gives me a nod and says "It's alright. I wasn't gonna let a nigger beat up a white kid." Okay, thanks again man. And believe me, from the bottom of my heart, believe me, I hate saying that word I hate the sound of it coming out of my mouth And I wish that's not how that went That's a true story. All these stories tonight are true And I wish, I wish it was different I wish it was the racist guy that was, that was mad at me the roles were reversed. That's not how it went down. Life wasn't simple that day There were these shades of grey. And I would argue that those shades of grey, where things get that awful and fucked up it's a big part of why this world seems so overwhelming and depressing to people like me. So he says that bullshit and I'm like "Ohh." I thought the car crash was the rock bottom And I think about that day a lot. I think about the aftermath of it And I get very upset with myself because I still didn't get help after that Everybody in my family thought that that was a car accident. And I've always been really good at hiding this side of myself Any time, any time at all when people ask me what's going on I keep myself way too busy That's always been my style. And back then, I was a fullâ€“time student at Rutgers University I had a fullâ€“time job. An appropriate level of enthusiasm Man these people at like Ohio State used to be like "Oâ€“Hâ€“IO!" Rutgers you like wait a minute, and you're like "I as well." Like that's really I was a fullâ€“time student there I had a fullâ€“time job. And I mentioned how much I loved comedy I found a place willing to let me do it. It's still here. It's in New York It's called the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater. Great space, great space! And I started there when I was 20 years old. And I loved it so much. And one night, I'm driving home from the UCB Theater back to my parents' house in Jersey where I still live at the time And it was after a particularly bad show It was an improvised parody of Japanese anime cartoons. And I was playing a schoolgirl named Urine And, needless to say, I wasn't feeling great about myself And I'm driving and I'm like, "I'm so exhausted all the time. Why?" "Like for that, is any of this even worth it And I can't breathe And the heat and pins and needles while I'm driving. And I pull off of Route 46 and I stop in this bank parking lot And I call Teresa. She was my girlfriend in college. And I say, "It's happening again and I'm driving and it's scary." And she interrupts me. She does what I think is the kindest thing anybody has ever done for me. She says, "Look. Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna go home right now. You're gonna wake up your mom and tell her what's going on because look I'm calling her. I'm calling her first thing tomorrow morning I'm telling her, so now's your chance to get one on your terms. She took the choice out of my hands. Thank God. That's what I needed back then. Although, believe me that night, not into it at all. At all. I'm like, "You can't do that. That's not yours to share This isn't fair. And she's like, "Fair? You wanna talk about fair? You still call me about this shit You dumped me 18 months ago asshole." TouchÃ©, touchÃ© I do what she says. I get home and it's about 2:30 in the morning and I walk into my parents' bedroom. And my mom's asleep in bed And my mom is this 5 footâ€“nothing arthritic, little Irishâ€“Catholic lady. And uh, and my dad, my dad had a job in PuertoRico was like a year or so. So randomly, he just lived on the island of Puerto Rico at that time And that means my mom is alone in this bed It's way too big for just her, you know It looks like she's like drowning in all those blankets. And I uh, I reach out to wake up my mother And before I touch her, I pause Because I realize that this is the last moment in my mom's life where she gets to think that she has a normal kid. And I almost bail. I almost just walk away But it's out of my hands now, right I gotta do it so I do it. I shake my mom awake and she's really confused and I just blurted out I said, "Mom, I'm suicidal. And I'm really scared." And she's blindsided by that. And I never, I never want to see my mom that frightened ever again And she puts on her glasses and she says "I didn't know. I, I don't know what to do" "What, what do you think we should do? "And I think to myself, "She sounds so much like Carmela Soprano." It's ridiculous. Feels good to tell somebody what's going on and it feels good to ask for help. And my mom, she steps up. Helps me find a doctor at a clinic on Bloomfield Avenue in Verona, New Jersey. And I go. At the end of that week, I see a doctor for the first time. Even though I didn't, I never wanted to, you know. And I get it. The first time you see a shrink you kind of feel like you failed. You know, like you're giving up. And especially where I'm from. My neighborhood in North Jersey. You tell someone you're going to see a shrink, they're going to be like, "Wait, what, why? Like you get to fix your life up or something like what, like what, you deserve to be so happy? what you think you are fucking better than me? That is the vibe where I grew up. I'm so sorry. Thank you, sir. I'm so sorry. I went, I went and I kept going even though I didn't like it at all And I was proud of that because it was my one hour a week where I was finally fighting back. But this doctor, I noticed right away, this doctor's questions Broad, vague questions Like they're not really addressing the things I'm even bringing up He's not really listening which I thought for a shrink was the only job requirement. I'm telling him about my childhood I'm like, parents, great, no complains there But I did grow up in this town, West Orange odd place at times. Kind of violent and like a lot of bullying and stuff. And like no real consequences for it even. My older brother, when he was 12 years old he got beat up by a bully so bad this kid broke my brother's shoulder Broke his collarbone in a fight. This happened at Edison Middle School The kid didn't even get into any trouble for that. I'm a few years younger than my brother I see that and I'm like okay I guess the world's like violent and aggressive and nobody's really going to help you out so like keep your guard up man. Like don't let anybody in. It really messed me up. It did And oddly enough, I mean this doesn't really matter It's not neither here nor there. But oddly enough that bully happened to be a little person. A dwarf broke my brother's shoulder. My childhood may as well just been directed by David Lynch. It made no sense. It made no sense. And this doctor, doctor interrupts me and goes "Are you gay?" I'm like, "What's that have to do with that? I don't think so." "That's an interesting answer." Not really though, right? Like there's a spectrum. Everybody's on it. We're fine. "M'kay. M'kay. But did your father hit you?" Did you not hear what I just said? A dwarf was breaking bones We definitely have shit to talk about. "Did your gay father hit you?" I said, motherfucker. What I realized is like he had these checklist questions He asked everybody these questions. And smelled the rat. His bullshit, I didn't like it. But I stuck with it. I did stick with it and, um even went on medication through the clinic doctor the first time. first time I went on meds it was via the clinic doctor And I didn't want to do that either for many reasons. Chief among them, mental health medications, to my knowledge that's the only type of medication that when people find out that you're taking it, they feel this freedom to offer up their entirely unsolicited opinions about it right to your face. It happens all the time And I don't think it's okay with any other sickness to just like say shit about the medications Like nobody has ever been diagnosed with diabetes and had their ignorant cousin go, "You're going to take insulin?" "For now, right? You'll get off that shit some day." No one in human history has ever said the words, "What's so wrong with your life that you need chemotherapy?" Never been said. When you take the medications that I take people say stuff like that legit all the time So I'm pushing back against it. I'm giving myself all the usual excuses. You won't really be yourself anymore, right. Or, uh, you'll be walking around in a fog or the big one for people like me you won't be creative anymore. You won't be funny if you take those pills You won't be funny unless you're a Sylvia Plathâ€“esque tortured soul improv kid. Which I will tell you, in my opinion, which is really all this show is that that creativity thing, that's the biggest bullshit myth that we allow to perpetuate. And I don't get it and not just perpetuate We romanticize that one. Still. We do People have said to me people have said to me like "Yeah but like Kurt Cobain though, right? Like those songs. Kurt Cobain." And I'm like, "Okay. You know what I'd love though? I would love if Kurt Cobain was still alive putting out shitty light rock albums I'd love that." I would love it if, in December, Kurt Cobain Dropped a Starbucks Exclusive Christmas album. I'd love that. I'd love that. I also, it's like, I don't even think that it's true Like I get it. I get that certain drugs can dull your creativity but a good doctor will just put you on different drugs. And one of my life's true regrets is that I bought into that one For years, I didn't take medicine for that reason And what a waste of time. Because I'm happy to tell you at least in my case, I am significantly fucking funnier on medication. It's not even, thanks. It's not even a contest. It's not, like I was always so scared I would lose my ideas That was the big fear from back then I'll lose my ideas if I take those pills And I think of these ideas from back then that I was so scared to lose and Like there was a night at Rutgers I called up all my comedy friends I said drop what you're doing and meet me at the diner I have the best idea I have ever had and they do they show up at the diner and they are like: "What's going on?" I'm like "Well here's what's going on is we're going to write a play, tonight It's going to be called Time Phone. It's about a phone where when you pick it up you can talk to people in other eras of time We're gonna perform it one night only also tonight In the cash machine booth at a local bank. First question, I know, Who's gonna see it? great question, well I guess if anybody needs money I guess they'll catch a few minutes of Time Phone And if not, then whatever guys it's just for us then right? Then it's just art for art's sake right guys?" Right guys? Right guys? And they're all eating chicken fingers like "No." And not only is Time Phone a pretty bad idea it's already the plot of a Dennis Quaid movie. Frequency is just that with a ham radio That's what I'm so worried about? That I won't be able to fly into a manic fit and rip off Dennis Quaid? So, even though I'm one of these people that was like medications yeah, I don't know about that, turns out, they do work really well for me And I know people have strong opinions on this one so let me just get this out of the way I'm not trying to convince anybody about any of this I promise I'm not, I'm not a shill. This show is not secretly sponsored by Pfizer, I swear we're good. I'm not even going to say that going on this drug this type of drug, it's not an easy thing to do. I would never say that there's side effects there's side effects now let alone in 2002. The drug cocktail that the clinic Doctor put me on then it was Depakote, Wellbutrin and Risperdal. And, Depakote, clinic doctor says one of the main side effects is that you can't lose weight while you're taking it so be careful what you eat. And I was like "Got it." But I was 22 years old, so I eat whatever I want And very quickly I develop the physique of like like a sad uncle who's like "Maybe I should have gotten married." That was my body type, dejected uncle. Wellbutrin, some people have side effects I mean I've never had any side effects from Wellbutrin. I'm back on Wellbutrin today. And I love it. That's what I have for breakfast every morning, is my Butrin Gimme that byootch baby. Goes down Smooth That's a tagline. Glad to see I have byootch people here tonight, that's good. Now I don't know if anybody's heard of Risperdal, you? Usually doesn't get cheers that one, usually people are like Cause you guys can, you do know that's a heavy duty one Everybody's heard of that knows, that an antipsychotic. I was put on that because half way through my time at Rutgers I started having very severe paranoia and it was getting delusional. For example, Rutgers is a very big campus And they have buses to take the kids around and you have to push that thing to tell the driver when it's time to stop the bus And I'd go to push the thing and I'd go, hmmm, naw, don't don't push that. If you push that, they can track you And I'd hear myself think that and I'd go "Hold on There is no they And on the off chance that there is I highly doubt that they are interested in the comings and goings of a C+ American Studies Major at an admittedly midâ€“tier state University in New Jersey." You know that it's true. I take the Risperdal that stops right away I stop thinking that cops are following me It's freedom, it feels like this freedom it does have one side effect it makes my back muscles tighten up this is apparently pretty common with this drug so they also put me on a muscle relaxer And that has a side effect that we are going to talk about. We're all familiar with male ejaculate, yeah? I know due to lifestyle preferences or experience levels not all of us come into contact with it on the regular but we're all adults here tonight we all understand that men ejaculate and there's a companion substance known as ejaculate. We all know certain range of colors to be expected with this substance There's a certain level of viscosity that one can rely upon in dealing with this substance. This is this is why you'll be so surprised to hear that when I was 22 years old I was masturbating, which is not the surprising part at all. When you're a 22â€“yearâ€“old male masturbation is most of what you accomplish on any given day. It's like golf it's like a sport you play against yourself you know? And I wanted to be good at it. I was putting in my Malcolm Gladwell 10,000 hours on that one In a big way. No, the surprising part is that I finished and I . . . I came water. Think about how I felt. Water came out of here And then very quickly it came out of here Because it was disturbing you can imagine you have all these thoughts you're like oh I guess I'm so fucked up that god's now removed my ability to reproduce You have that thought. And then even physically it wasn't good like it was not even a good amount of water And I'm already not the most powerful ejaculator. And if there's one thing you remember from this show if there's one thought that really sticks with ya I hope it's that I, Chris Gethard Not the most powerful ejaculator. But it was not even good by my standards Like you know you know when your landlord working on the pipes and disconnects the water but you don't know it and you turn on the faucet and get that last little bledebaba I would have killed for that water pressure I would have loved that. Really, the only thing that I can compare it to is when you are eating spicy food and and you open your mouth too wide and then from under your tongue you get that spritz That little saliva you know? Where I grew up that was called Gleaking We called that Gleaking They don't put that on the bottle side effects include: your dick gleaks." They leave, they leave that one out. Everytime I bring up the medications, it always makes me think about Barb Because when I started with Barb in 2007 she says to me "you need to be back on pills" that is very clear. But check this out I get a lot of free samples from the pharmaceutical companies So maybe we'll just like slip you some get the dosage right, you know? Now this is perfectly legal but I like that she handled it with the tone of a street level drug dealer I love that I love, made me laugh, made me feel comfortable Like, like she's playing ball with me Like made me feel like she was ready to go any length for my treatment I love that . Although I'm the first to admit she can take that too far every once in a while. Like there was a time before she moved to New Mexico I'm in her, I'm in Barb's office one day she says to me "Hey there's this guy, his office is right down the hall from mine we have been teaming up on patients we're getting great results my specialties, his specialty a lot of crossover there I think you need to see this guy." I say "ok, what's his specialty?" She says "Numerology." I go, I go "Numerology? Numerology? Like, I give this guy my birth date and other significant dates throughout my life and then he analyzes them and predicts my future?" And she says "Bingo!" I'm like No, that, not for me you know Although I don't judge it I'm actually don't like if she says that people are feeling better because of Numerology then great whatever makes people feel better I'm a proponent of it. Different things work for different people all the time, you know like some people self medicate and apparently it works, I'm jealous That's great, more power to you, I tried Alcohol, is how I tried to self medicate. When I started with Barb she says to me she goes: "You don't drink booze anymore huh? How come, are you, you an alcoholic?" And I'm like, "I'm not an alcoholic I never drank every day." And she goes "That's not actually what being an alcoholic is it's a lot more about your relationship with alcohol." And I go, "Barb we can move on, okay? Like, I'd get a little out of control but we're good I am not an alcoholic." And she say give me an example of your behavior. And I'm like ok, fine I remember one night I'm at Rutgers and I'm out drinking at the bars on Easton Avenue and I'm with this girl, we've always been flirty and I really want to impress her so every time she has a pint I have a pitcher. throwing it back and really quickly she's like "Yo, this isn't cool man I'm going to head home." And I'm like "Great yeah whatever I'll head home too, no problem." And here's where I baffle myself is I know I've had too much to drink that just happened. It's embarrassing. Still, I get home, my roommates are drinking I grab a bottle from one of them crack it open chug the entire thing top to bottom throw the empty bottle on the ground. Now, my roommates are drinking Mad Dog 20/20, which some of you have heard of For anybody who's not familiar with Mad Dog 20/20, congratulations, you've never been homeless. That's great. That's great. We're drinking Strawberry Kiwi flavor I drank the whole thing, my roommates are like "we can't believe you just did that." I'm like "You can't? Gimme another one." I chug another entire big bottle of Mad Dog that's when this night goes nuts I start opening windows and I'm yelling at people out on the street and I'm getting in my roommates faces trying to convince them they should fightand I'm rolling around on the ground And In the middle of all this chaos my roommate Phil comes home and he doesn't size things up well He goes "Bros, I'm going to a frat party. Anybody wanna come?" And the rest of my roommates were like "Phil, no no, nononono" And I'm like "Yeeeeaah." I'm coming to the frat party Phil I'm coming and I'm just going to do me Phil I'm just going to behave however I feel like it tonight Phil, And if anybody has a issue with that I'll let them know that you're responsible for bringing me Phil. I'll let everybody know." And right then my roommate Dan grabs me and goes "Phil, run!" And Phil runs. He sprints out the front door of our house Dan is holding my arms down he 's like "You gotta calm down man." I'm like "Fine, whatever." he helps me get up to my room in the attic, up all the steps. I get undressed he tucks me into bed. I fall asleep. Should be the end of this story. Except the next thing I know I come to again and I'm fully clothed and I am running down the middle of a street in New Brunswick, New Jersey And I am wearing a Batman mask. I don't know where I got it I've never owned a Batman mask I don't even like DC Comics! But I am wearing it and I am running maybe from the person I stole the Batman mask from. I black out again. I come to on the front porch of a House I'm trying to open the door there's a guy holding it closed from the other side going "No, seriously Batman, you can not come in here." I black out. I come to I'm on top of a parked car I am jumping up and down, there's people surrounding the entire car going "Batman, Batman." I black out. I come to, I'm back in my room, thank God And I'm sitting on the edge of my bed, blinking through the Batman mask and as, as I get my bearings I realize that on the couch in the corner of my room there are two adult men who can only be described as sketchy. And they're looking at me and I say "Hey uh, you have to get out of my house." And they look at each other and the one guy goes "Wait, what?" And I go "You uh, you, you have to go You have to get out of my house." And the other guy goes "Okay but , what happens?" And I realize that I must be in the middle of telling these guys a story. And they want to know how it ends But I don't know, I'm completely obliterated and I don't know what's going on so I stand up and I'm like "seriously you gotta go you gotta get out of my house " And at that exact moment Barb interrupts me and is like "Yeah, you are definitely an alcoholic." Okay. Now by 2004 I'm actually feeling pretty good I've been going to see the clinic Doctor for two years, I've been medicated for two years I've been sober for two years I'm learning to let my guard down, letting people in, and I don't think it's a coincidence I have this newfound positivity. That year I get my first full time job in comedy I am hired to be the writers' assistant for a show on Comedy Central And that's not a very glamorous entertainment job a writer's assistant it's a lot of ordering lunches making copies, and stuff. But I don't care you can imagine I'm this kid and I've always clung to comedy and now it my gig, that is the best. Oh, there's one hitch they say you have the job, and it starts on Monday in Los Angeles. Now at this point I, I still live in Montclair New Jersey I'm about ten minutes from my mom. And I have to call my mom and say "Hey, Ma I have great news, but remember a couple years ago I woke you up and in the middle of the night saying I wanted to be dead? Now I'm going to go 3,000 miles away I'm actually going to go as far away as I can go and still be on the continental United States." And you can imagine a lot of fear from my mother a lot of concern like "You can't, maybe you can just like wait and get a job in New York you know" but She knew, she knew I had to go and I do. I do I dropped my entire life and I drive crossâ€“country and that trip's the best. For me, that trip is 3,000 miles of nothing but The Smiths. That is it. Because when you're twentyâ€“four years old and you're feeling hope for the first time in a long time and you hear a lyric like "When you want to live how do you start? Where do you go? Who do you need to know? Ohâ€“ohhh." You are like "Totally different era of life This motherfucker still gets me man." How does he do it? He's a genius. We all know, he would've been knighted a long time ago if he didn't threaten to kill the queen so many times right?. Definitely. Definitely All these things, happen on this trip. Like I stay in an hourly hotel in Indiana that I think was a brothel, didn't ask never knew for sure. And I got stuck, I got stuck in a lightning storm in Texas Which was actually very beautiful and dangerous but, beautiful. And then I'm driving in New Mexico on this long straight highway and this side of the car is just prairie it's just grass that's it that's all you can see, and this side sand, nothing but desert. And we all know it very desolate out there in the west I'm driving thirty, thirty five, forty minutes I don't pass another car the entire time I'm just out there, alone. Except for the train There's these train tracks, there right alongside the highway it's one of these big freight trains that you see out in the middle of the country and I get really into it. I'm, I'm not sure why, I just start glancing over I'm Like "okay mmhmm, looks like we got ourselves some train action right now huh?" You know, I'm trying to guess what's in it You know? I'm like maybe it's like, maybe it's like hay? No. Why would you put hay in a train you fucking idiot. Coal. It's gotta be coal, and then the tracks veer of in to the horizon and I'm like "Ohhh I wanted to get to the bottom of the mystery." And then they com back toward the highway and I'm like "Ohâ€“hoâ€“hoâ€“hoâ€“hoâ€“hoâ€“ho, looks like we're just at the beginning of our journey train." I couldn't figure out why it was making me feel so elated and then I realized that for the first time since the age of eleven I'm not worried about anything. And I swear to you, I could see it in my head what this must have looked like from above like I could a flash of the bird's eye view and I realized zoom out just a little bit, You won't be able to make out my car against the asphalt of the road And zoom out a little bit more than that and those train tracks you'd be like is that another road, or? Is it a river what's going on there? And zoom out just a little bit more and it all of it blends together. None of it makes any sense. And it occurs to me that I'm small and I do not matter, and that is beautiful. And what I mean by that is I was living this life where every day I mean every single day, usually before I even left the house I'd find some reason to be angry, or sad, or scared. And ask the other depressed people in your life you do that enough days in a row and you just become convinced that that is who you are. That's how you're wired, that's how you have to live Because that's your option And I realized out there on that highway in New Mexico that another option is maybe someday I die old and happy. I honestly did not know that I had that option. So, anyway, I make it to California I conquer the entertainment industry depression goes away forever, thank you guys thank you, thank you. No, No need to, it was fake the whole time. It's California I didn't conquer anything. California was fun, it was not.. Cali woo, California fun As the Beach Boys said in 38 songs California Fun. Woo Hoo. I've brought up New Jersey a hundred and seventy times to no enthusiasm I mention California once and people are like "yeah!" California was fun It was not all sunshine And I actually mean that in a literal sense I wind up renting this very cheap room it has no windows, and also my office, it has no window. And I'm working very long hours so I've never been to California in my life, I finally get out there and just never see the sun And it gets unhealthy very fast I start getting nosebleeds all the time, like three times a week. And my boss, he grabs me eventually and he says "You have to go outside for thirty minutes everyday I'm ordering you." And I go "Why?" And he goes "Because I think I'm watching you die." So I do. I go outside for half an hour every day and I play basketball with Juancho and Humberto, who to this day they're coolest guys I've ever met they work on our show they grew up in Tijuana, Mexico. They're so smart and funny and just like by far to this day the most chill dudes I've ever hung out with. And they're really tough but they also love Morrissey Which, I don't know if everybody's heard about this? Turns out in southern California almost every Mexicanâ€“American male just has a real love of Morrissey I promise i'm not being racist google it, there's academic essays trying to get to the bottom of this shit There are. And to meet guys who are tough but who also love Morrissey I've never felt better about this in my life Never felt better about that one. I'll say this too, even with the internet 3,000 miles means you can cut people out And, and there were people who were very very negative in my life I just never spoke to them again And life starts getting fun. It really does, I sleep with two girls in the four months that I am in California, back then: Sinatraesque hot streak yo No idea. And I'm meeting all these new people and they don't know me they do not know me as this anxiety riddled mess from New Jersey They're just like "Who's this new kid that loves sex and basketball?" That's who I am to them. Then a great thing happens we get a mid season pick up which is really rare in TV It means while we're working on the show the Network calls and they're like "Hey, we love how it's coming out keep going, we're going to give you even more money than we originally said so you can make more Your dream gets to be your job at least a little while longer." And it's great news There are a lot of logistics to take care of though like I have to call the clinic doctor back in New Jersey. I call the clinic doctor I leave a message on his answering machine and I say "Hey good news but it means I have to be out here for four months You prescribed me three months worth of medication so just let me know how we handle that." And about a week goes by I don't hear back so I call again, I leave another message on the clinic Doctor's machine And I say, "Hey I counted out my pills and I'm definitely running out while I'm out here, so I don't know, can you prescribe over the phone or should I space out when I'm taking them? I really just need a game plan." Because you don't want to go cold turkey off any medication really, right? Let alone a mental health one Let alone Risperdal. Right Risperdal people? No way. If you want to be able to not fall asleep tonight Google "What happens If I go cold turkey off Risperdal?" Read the very lengthy list that comes up I've done it. Here's some of my favorite selections from that list. "Psychosis. Black out states Homicidal thoughts, and actions Sweating" and I love that they even include sweating why bother? Why put sweating on that list. Why? It's like "Oh, if you don't black out and murder someone, whoof." But all jokes aside I'm getting very scared And a few days later I call again I'm leaving another massage on the clinic Doctor's machine He picks up, cuts me off while I'm leaving it he says "I don't understand why you keep calling me You're not my patient anymore." And I say, "Excuse me?" And he says "you, you when you started with me when you started with me you signed paperwork that said if you don't see me for a certain number of weeks then I am no longer responsible for you I am not liable for you." And I cut him off "I say hold on okay Let me, let me just cop to this, if you say I signed that piece of paper I'm sure I did. I'm certain you're correct about that But please just keep in mind that the first day I saw you I signed a lot of pieces of paper I was also twenty two years old I was suicidal, And I was terrified so pardon me if I don't Remember every piece of paper that I signed And even if that is the case that's how you handle this? You just chose to not pick up the phone? I have told you more about me than I've ever told Anybody you know that I am further away from my family than I have ever been and you chose to not pick up the phone? That is really fucked up." And I wind up talking about this situation with a coâ€“worker and she puts me in touch with her shrink I get a last minute emergency appointment. And I see this guy. I'm really freaked out telling him what's going on And he stops me about five minutes into the session he stops me, he goes, "hold on, I'm going to calm you down I'm going to write you your prescriptions right now right in front of you so you know that you have these. Because you need these and I am quoting him when he says "Your doctor in New Jersey sounds like an asshole." That is his professional diagnosis of his peer. That job's up. I come back East I see this clinic doctor again I say "get me off these pills man because I can only get them you from and I will never trust you again I just won't. Get me off the pills." And I do. I wean off the pills at the end of 2004, safely. And 2004â€“2007, good years honestly. No complaints at all I move to New York, start picking up jobs none of them are the dream but I'm inching closer. Writing gigs, weird ones At one point I am hired to write jokes for the NFL Player Chad Ochocinco. Nobody, to this day nobody has ever explained to me why a member of the Cincinnati Bengals needed jokes but I'll take your money I don't care. I'll take that cash. Give me that. I get acting, I start getting acting work I'm getting mostly commercials mostly commercials. If you search my name on Youtube to this day, you go deep enough in the search results, you can still find a very annoying commercial for H&R Block where I wear lederhosen you can find that. And, I once auditioned for a Subway Sandwich Commercial to play the role of "Man who is Unattractive to Women." That was the character's name in the script they couldn't even call him Doug or something like that. I didn't book that part, I'm assuming because And I'm home one day I'm in Woodside, Queens where I live at the time and I'm in my underwear and a Tâ€“shirt I'm eating cereal not because it's breakfast time but because the gas has been disconnected from my stove. Not even because I'm broke I just forgot to pay it a few times and they turned it off and I'm like whatever I don't care, who cares and then it stayed off for like a year and a half It's true. My phone rings, my phone rings. It's a 212 number I don't recognize "Hello?" "Hey buddy how's it going!" "It's alright . . . I'm sorry who is this?" "Seth Meyers!" Now, I just want to be very clear. Seth Meyers is behaving as if he and I have spoken on the telephone before This is not the case. "Oh, um . . . is everything okay?" yeah actually I wanted to run something past you. We have a little extra money in the budget do you want to be a writer at Saturday Night Live?" "Yeah." Turns out I have a two week guest writer contract at SNL next thing I know I'm at 30 Rockefeller Center I'm walking the halls with all the pictures of the past hosts. It's like Steve Martin, Tom Hanks, Jason Priestley? Really? Like what, you know? I'm staying up all night I'm staying up all night, I'm working on sketches with the cast and the writers, it's like so hands on, it's so fun. It's everything we have all read about in the too many oral histories of that show. Then the two weeks is up and it goes away and they're nice about it they're cool They're like, "We like what you do it's just not what we do, you know? It's not a great match, this job's not for you" And man does the bottom fall out And I want to be clear I need to be clear I'm not trying to stand up here in front of all you guys going, oh poor me I didn't get a cool job That's not the issue. The issue actually, is that I did get the job And nothing changed. Nothing. I spent my whole adult life chasing jobs that's just what I did, and I always figured you get one of those jobs you know like one of those brass ring jobs that everybody's trying to grab onto. You've got to feel so validated, right? Everyone has to recognize how amazing you are. That didn't happen. And I knew in my heart I knew even if that had worked out long term that was never going to happen. No job can change the fact that I don't have it together enough to have a functioning stove. Comedy does not exist to fix me. Maybe, just maybe, banking my entire emotional health on a successful career in the arts wasn't a good idea. And the next few months, bad, bad ends with me having an attack that lasts for four days unbroken four days long it's the longest one I have ever had it was brutal. And, my roommate at the time starts making me sleep on the couch and then he's making sure I fall asleep before he does He thinks I'm going to hurt myself. And on the fourth day, he says "dude don't put me in this position anymore man You've gotta, you've gotta find help man I'm getting really scared." And this is a guy who grew up in Chicago and like doesn't he doesn't get scared. He doesn't, he never, he didn't want to go to the hospital when he had fucking kidney stones He's never been scared so. Gets through to me and I do what he says And I reach out to some doctors and that's when I find Barb And guess what, guys? Everything's great now! Because "He's melancholy she's quirky, but it works! Gethard and Barb, coming to ABC Family this fall!" Family friendly sitcom. I wish. I wish it was like we sail off into the sunset when I meet my weirdo shrink But that would be very disingenuous actually. Because that would imply that meeting Barb has somehow healed me And that's not the case at all I still take pills everyday as soon as I wake up every night right before bed I've gotten past this tough guy I won't need the pills some day thing. It's medicine, I take it, it's fine. And I still get depressed, pretty frequently, actually Although I think you'll be happy to hear nine times out of ten when it shows up now, I handle my depression how we all handle a cold. You know, like there's days there's days when you wakeup and you're like, "ugh I feel like this ugh, okay." And then you move on right? You do what you have to do You go to work, I'm lucky enough to come here as my work. You guys go to offices where you gâ€“chat people it's like, you know. You do what you do. I can handle my depression that way because I take my medicine and because I have worked very hard and because I lean on Barb. With her help I have decided at the very least I would love it if this wasn't the thing that kills me I can say that now. And since she came up again since I mentioned Barb one more time I want to make sure you guys know Barb is well aware of this show she knows all about it I was really up front with her, I say, I Go "Barb one of the running themes of this show one of the ideas that I return to again and again is that you're not great at your job Is that okay with you?" And she says "Yeah, whatever." She goes "I think you should work on it like It sounds like a good challenge and if you can make that stuff funny it'll be more gratifying than the usual bullshit jokes you write." She goes "I actually think it's a really good idea I think it's such a good idea that you should come to Mexico live in my house, and you and me will write the show together." And I go "No!" She says "Why?" I'm like "You have to pretend to be a real doctor one fucking time!" What are we even talking about? But even with her in my life even with someone like Barb who I so clearly trust and enjoy as much as I do stuff still goes down every once in a while. The last really major incident I had it was in 2012. I'd been seeing Barb for five full years by then. I fell off the wagon that year I performed comedy at a music festival called Bonnaroo And after the show a bunch of the comedians wanted to celebrate and they say "Hey we think we're going to do MDMA" And I said, "Oh I've heard of that right, MDMA they call that molly that's the stuff ecstasy is made out of, right? I've heard that's very fun." And they're like "It's so fun, and it's actually super relaxed man it's like very chill." Like, I don't know, like maybe. And I'm like "You know what I haven't had a drink in many years at this point clearly I can demonstrate some selfâ€“control, now I think I'm going to try some MDMA. And I do. I try it, and I like it I like it a lot, I'm like Wow my skin is so tingly and I had no idea that a fire hydrant and me, and God are actually the same thing. Never knew any of that I like it so much that over the next 36 hours I personally eat 300 dollars worth of MDMA which we just heard a whole bunch of users gasp at. Because you guys know that's too much MDMA. It was also explained to me later I guess it's well known amongst people that use this drug you're gonna get depressed in the days after you do it. This is like a thing everybody knows about this drug I would not have taken it if I had known that. I suffer from lifelong massive depression issues. All I needed to do to avoid a completely fucked up summer was just take out my phone and just Google "MDMA what happens?" That's it! I did not even put in that much work. And everything goes haywire I get back to New York I break up with this girl who I've been seeing for years And I move out on that roommate who I think saved my life And I start staying out all the Time I'm partying like seven nights a week. I start sleeping around which we've known each other for an hour You guys know that that's not me I am well aware that I look like I wandered off the pages of a children's clothing catalogue. I know that. But I'm charming, I'm not going to claim I'm charming all of New York city that summer but I am definitely charming significant portions of both Greenpoint and Williamsburg That is true. It turns out looking vaguely like Ira Glass goes a long way in Brooklyn It does, it turns out. There was one girl who I could not charm and I remember it very well because it actually hurt, it hurt pretty bad. There was this group of friends and we always went out dancing that was our thing. And this one girl she was this leggy redhead punk rocker I thought she was the coolest. And we live in the same neighborhood so, walking home same direction you know, and the vibe is there. I decide to make the move. And she goes "pfffffffffft." I'm like But we're friends, we're friends And then she's like "Yeah no, no offense like maybe someday but c'mon dude you got to get your shit together." And I'm like, "Oh that, yeah Absolutely, no argument from me you are very perceptive I only like you more now." It was one of those, right. And I tricked Barb that summer mostly via lying. Because I told her I told her I did the drugs And she asked if I was okay and I just said yeah I didn't tell her everything was like spiraling out of control. She had no idea. I was hiding it She didn't know I was behaving really erratically very out of character If she had known that, she would have done a lot of things differently. She says to me that summer "Hey I think you have ADD I want to put you on Adderall." And I say, "Yep!" Because I don't know much about Adderall except that college kids abuse it, and it was that kind of summer man It really was. It turns out Adderall is an amphetamine I didn't really, I didn't know that It's an amphetamine. Scientifically speaking it's not that different from meth. And that summer I basically become a meth head. I am popping Adderall like jelly beans I am eating 60 milligrams of Adderall every day which we just heard a grad student gasp at We heard it. Good luck on your thesis. I hope it goes well. Now this drug, I'm not trying to throw this drug under the bus it can really turn people's lives around, it really can I was abusing it, I deserved all the weird side effects that I got and there were many There were many. Anything that happened to my body that summer if I Google Adderall, comma, whatever's happening, it comes up Like, Adderall can't get a boner, yup. Adderall, boner will not go away, yup Adderall, shitting blood, yup. Turns out that Adderall can make you like very Dehydrated and hypertense and that gives you these internal hemorrhoids And then what happens is like, let's say maybe like like maybe you're not eating enough fiber you know or like you got some stressful stuff going on. You go, you're not hydrated, you push they burst. The blood. Did you guys have any questions, or? Are you good? â€“ I'm okay. â€“ You're good, great, good, good Everybody's good guys. Everybody's good. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry I go to see a doctor about this problem He bends me over a table He takes a device that I am not kidding is called an "Anusâ€“scope" he inserts it into me, then recoils and says "Wow...you have particularly beefy hemorrhoids." So that's been said to me. So that summer I start doing as many shows as I Can cause comedians in New York we're really lucky If I want to do five, six, seven shows a night I can do that in this town, I'm lucky. You know, that's if I want to break my back And as you guys know if I don't want people asking me what's going on I keep myself way too busy. So one Sunday night I'm on stage at the Upright Citizens Brigade where I came up. I'm in an improve show there It's called Asscat It's been running for twenty years and it's a pretty notorious show. Mostly because famous people do it like the SNL Cast or different sitcom stars when they're around, drop in mess around, do improv. That's important, it's a mess around show It's not if you go and no one is taking this seriously I'm warning you now Like people make fun of each Other sell each other out, people will be drinking on stage It's fun though. It's like, it's not a good Show it's good people intentionally doing a bad show. It's funny, it's kind of, it's almost it's like the comedy equivalent of an NBA All Star game in that way. Which even if you don't like basketball I'm begging you watch the All Star game it is my favorite thing all year. You get all the best basketball players on the entire planet no exaggeration, and they show up in the same arena and then they're like, "You know what? This doesn't count in the standings. Shoot from half court nobody play defense who gives a shit about this!" And its really fun man. It's really fun. And I'm in this scene with another actor and he makes a joke about me Fair game, that happens every week in that show people make jokes about each other you know let it go who cares? But that summer I just can't handle it. I don't even remember what I say but his response is "Well at least I can straighten my arms" and he's referring to this, I don't know if you've noticed this about me I got this thing going on. My mom has it and she passed it on to me and it sucks but who cares. Let it go make fun of him back move on that's how the show works. You know. But that summer I feel like man all these people are laughing at what I think is this really hideous thing about me and when that thought enters my brain, my breath just goes And the heat and the pins and needles and this is happening on stage and that's never that's never happened to me before and I can't let all these people see this And I don't know I don't know what to do So I turn around and I leave I walk, I walk off stage In the middle of the show I leave. And people always want to know people always ask me who said the thing about you. Who said that joke about your arms they always want to know, and I have not wanted to share it. Because famous people do get involved in that Show And I don't want this thing with my name on it to be reduced to like TMZ gossip bullshit. But... during our stage run of the show like we took audience feedback sometimes and people expressed they were very dissatisfied by that. And they were passionate about it to a weird Degree Like multiple people used the word Cheated One guy, and one guy used the phrase blue balled I'm like, calm down. Calm down You know. So what I've done, and I want to honor it even here is I've come up with this game as a Compromise where every single time I perform this show I give one hint and then it's up to you guys Is that okay if I give you one hint? Great. Here's your one hint . . . He played a character named Kenneth the Page on 30 Rock. So put on your detective hats and see what you... I walk off stage This mystery actor follows me. And he's behind me in the tech booth at UCB This is a long narrow hallway he's behind me he's mad, and I get it. I do. He's like, "Dude, that's how the show works man, you can't do this Like, we both look bad. You look like a baby You're making me look like a bully man. This is not cool." And he's correct about that, he is correct about that And we, I want to make sure you guys know, he and I had already been very tight friends for over ten years at the point and we're still friends today. He lives in Los Angeles now and he still texts me every single year on my birthday which is way more than you get from most of your friends that move to Los Angeles He's a good guy, very good Guy Good friend and he did not have ill intentions. But he also hadn't seen me yet, he's been behind me this whole time We get to the Green Room, I turn around I don't even say a word he goes "I'm sorry. I didn't know." Because 10 years of friendship he understands that I deal with this stuff and as soon as he looks me in the eye he realizes that I am not even there and he says "I'm sorry, I didn't know," and I say "It's okay, it's not your fault It's just been a really rough summer, Jack McBrayer." So, I push past the mystery actor and I leave UCB, and I get in my car. I should not be driving like this but I'm freaking out and I'm making random turns I have no plan, and the next thing I know I'm in the Lincoln Tunnel I'm headed to Jersey. I don't know why, I haven't lived in Jersey in ten years at this point but that will always be my home and maybe if I get out there I'll calm down I do and I don't It's just getting even worse I gotta try something else. So the next thing I do is I put on The Smiths. Because when you're 32 years old and you're having a night like that and you hear lyrics like "Sing me to sleep. Sing me to sleep I'm tired and I. I want to go to bed Don't feel bad for me I want you to know deep in the cell of my heart I will feel so glad to go There is another world. There is a better world There must be. On a night like that when you hear lyrics like those you think to yourself, thank god somebody else knows this impulse and he's not calling me a fucking coward. So I make a bunch of random turns and eventually I wind up in Weehawken, New Jersey I don't know why. I don't know much about Weehawken. I know more now cause of Linâ€“Manuel Miranda. But there's these cliffs there's these cliffs in Weehawken They overlook the Hudson River and the Manhattan skyline and I am on the cliff I think I should jump And instead I sit on this bench all by myself, and I cry. And, I do want to just make sure you guys know Though that's the best view of the Manhattan skyline you're ever going to see. It is, somebody knows, a few people know. Boulevard East, Weehawken New Jersey, stunning view Overwhelming view. You take a date out there, you'll blow their mind You're gonna hook up that night trust your boy gethard on that one Trust your boy. Don't tell your date you found out about it in a suicide show. Here's how I know it's a really good date spot I'm sitting on this bench all by myself crying and these two couples are walking towards me. They're on the promenade along on the cliff one of these couples they're on a double date very very clearly on a double date that's the vibe. One of these couples sits right here on my bench. And the other couple sits here on my bench And they're talking and they're joking and laughing. And no one mentions the crying 32 year old man who's also on the bench And I'm like "What's going on? Can they not even see me? They can't even see me I must be a ghost. I'm the ghost of Weehawken, New Jersey." I stand up off my crying bench. I'm like "I'm a ghost and nobody can see me And if that is true then that means I can do whatever I want because if nobody can even see me then there's not even consequences to my actions." And I wander around Weehawken for a few hours in this manic haze and it's bad There's a steakhouse up on the cliff fancy place you can imagine, it overlooks the Manhattan skyline and I need to be clear I don't actually say any of the following. I am thinking all of the following thoughts, I never verbalize them I don't say a word but I enter this Steakhouse I start walking up to tables and in my head I'm like: "Pfffft Bro, you got a burger at a steakhouse? Come on man, What are you doing man? Your date's gonna think you're cheap Scallops, nice. How come seafood's always good at a Steakhouse I've never really understood that. . . A steak at a steakhouse. Thank you. Do we see how it's done everybody? Do we see how it's done?" But again, I don't actually say any of that. So all these people in this expensive restaurant see is a crying 32 year old man burst in and go and then leave And it's bizarre. It's bizarre to the degree that I wouldn't be surprised if one of the people there that night is doing their own one man show just about seeing that. I wander through Weehawken for a long while more and eventually I wind up back on my crying bench And I don't know what to do. So I call Barb, and she says "Hey, you never call me at night or on the weekends? What's going on?" And I said "Barb, I lost it on stage I couldn't breath, this guy he made a joke about me Jack McBrayer is his name and I'm in Weehawken Now and I don't even really know how I got here, but there were scallops involved and now I'm up on a cliff and I can't feel my face but I'm up, I'm up on a cliff " And she stops me. She goes, "Let me ask you a couple of questions Compared to a few hours ago do you feel like you're headed in the right direction or the wrong one?" And I say "I feel like total garbage still but I mean I guess if you make me consider it like that I guess I do feel slightly better, I guess I'm headed in the right direction." And she says, "That's good And it's good you called me, right?" And I say, "Yeah." And she says "We'll talk about it on Thursday." Which is not the correct thing to say When you have a historically suicidal patient call you from a cliff. But she knows me really well she knows how I'm going to react As soon as she says it, the spell lifts because I realize it's Sunday It's actually after midnight, technically it's Monday I can make it to Thursday. Even if I feel this horrible the entire time I can do that, when you put it like that, I can do that I can make it to Thursday. And I'll tell you something about my life my life's taken this very unexpected turn the past few years because I have started talking about this stuff in my comedy a little bit never as in depth as I am doing with this show. And I've written, I've written about this side of Myself a couple times online, and this has lead to a situation that I never saw coming. Where I am not exaggerating when I say that at this point I have now received thousands of Emails Facebook messages any way people get in touch they do and they're people who need help And a lot of times, I swear to you they don't even know I'm a comedian They don't know anything about me they'll just Google who will talk about this stuff and this thing I wrote comes up. And so often they are really young And they help. And you'll be happy to hear any time somebody asks me for help I say the same thing straight away I go look "First things first I'm not a Professional And it's not like I can tell you something my shrink told me because she's not really a professional either. But when I answer these messages especially when they're from young kids I almost always find myself telling them some version of that Thursday story. And I say for me it was that it was a length of time that I needed to last For you maybe It's a place where you feel safe Or a person you feel okay opening up to. I don't know. It's probably will not be that easy. You don't get to pick what breaks you You really cannot predict what's going to save you. But please keep your eyes peeled for it Please, because I bet that its out there and I bet you can find yours because I found mine and I never dreamed I'd be strong enough to say that. I mean, there were fifteen years of my life You guys have heard about them tonight fifteen years where the entire time for fifteen years I was just completely convinced that I was never going to feel better. And now, when I call my mom she doesn't have to be scared And I'm not wasting all this time pretending comedy is gonna fix me somehow. It's not. This isn't the type of thing that gets fixed you just you'll live with it. And I don't hide it anymore. I never have to hide it. From anyone ever again because my wife has seen this stuff at it's worst and she still loves me. And I still love that leggy redheaded punk rocker. Even if she doesn't know how to close a god damn cabinet door. I get another type of email too though I get another type of email all the time It's from people who aren't the ones actually suffering from this stuff but they see it. They're around it. It's in their lives They say "My cousin, my coâ€“worker, my friend I'm watching them I'm watching them deal with this really horrible thing and I want to help but Then they almost always add this caveat and it drives me nuts They say, "I really want to help but I don't want to mess anything up I wouldn't want to make it worse." And that gets under my skin and those people I almost always find myself telling them about the clinic Doctor from back in the day that clinic Doctor. I say you sound too much like that guy right now. He never wanted to be responsible for messing anything up He refused to be liable should anything get worse And that's why he needed everything to be so correct. I say, "Don't be like that Be like Barb She doesn't give a fuck what's correct. But she really always tries to do what's right And when it came down to it she chose to pick up the phone. And that's why I have so much love her. And it's why I always will. Even though . . . She once told me . . . That in the nineteen seventies She starred in a pornographic film
