You always do that to me Do what? Play dumb You play dumb. You know why I had us stop, you know why But you have this way of making it seem like, like it's unimportant to you. You know? Like you could have done without it It's... Isn't it obvious, huh? that I just wanted to spend some time together It's not that it's not...important to me. but I can't tell if I'm here for you, or if I'm here for you to put on a show What are you talking about? You showing off with her, in the forest I don't know know... -I mean. come on you really thought I wouldn't find you? Give me a break Maybe? I... I guess we're weird.

Hitting me on the head with a newspaper I don't want a family that prays before dinner because that's bullshit I wanna hit her hard, and I want you to be ok with it.

See I don't even care, 'cause I don't even care Cool... -If you say so I'll be right back Is everything ok with you two? Yeah I mean, it's just, you know... It's like, the way it is What do you mean? Well I think it's really hard for her because, she wants me to care for her But, and I know you've noticed this, I am not capable of caring for anybody, so Come on What? -What is it you're not saying? I'm...saying what I'm saying I hear what you're saying. I do. but obviously something else is going on here I mean what you're saying just doesn't have anything to do with this So, what is it? I mean, are we making you uncomfortable? No! No. You're really beautiful You're both beautiful together So does it. like. feel like you're a part of her? Is that, is that what it feels like? Yeah... Yeah. I'd say so So do you think that um... Do you... -Do I think what? Nevermind Hey Bobbi... -hmm? Do you remember that time when I kissed you on the lips? Where are you going with this? -Do you remember? Yeah. Ok what of it? Do you know why I did it? Well I really try not to think about it You had just told me that you liked girls And you were so fragile And then at school I saw you in the hallway after those girls had left you And... You were crying But you wouldn't tell me why Do you know what that did to me? Do you know what it did to me? -No Hold on a second Do you know what it did to me? Do you know what it was like-- --To see your little face... So pure... and just, wanting to be loved And then, you'd give me these tight little hugs, and you just wouldn't let go You were so, so soft and sweet, and loving, and giving everybody a second chance And that day. I knew that you had experienced real pain. And I knew that it would make you hard. So what else was I supposed to do To make you know that you were loved? You could of thought of something else No! No. I could have acted differently, but I couldn't think of anything else I'm not bothered by you You're both...different I'm different. I'm different I--I'm an idiot who doesn't know how else to show things! Sam... It's ok Hey Do it for me Hey Hi... You were supposed to protect me from feeling this way I have one limit I have one fucking thing that I ask of you I know I know I'm supposed to be your baby girl But you are, sweetie Let's just go do this No. No. Let's go home, ok? I'm gonna take you home You need to have this. I need you to have this No! I need you, ok? All I need is you. It consumes you... I can see that now So if you're going to have used me like this at least let it be for something I never should have answered when you called me. -Yeah so that's the answer, huh? Let's just redo the past five years all over again I'm toxic to you, don't you get that? I can't fucking take care of you! That's all I'm supposed to do. is just take care of you -Not now! -and I just can't! -Ok not now! You wanna disappear again, fine. Just don't do this shit right fucking now! Ally? -What? Don't snap at me. I made a mistake, it doesn't give you the right to disrespect me Bullshit. -Excuse me? No. -I fucking hate that word. No! You do not have the right to wrecklessly reign over me Please Excuse me? Why do you do that? What? Say "excuse me" when you really want to say my name? Oh... Um Out of respect, I suppose Would you like to say something in it's place? Like what? You don't mind if I have a drink, do you? -Of course not Would you like one? -Um. sure Why don't you call me Mistress Let me hear you say it Mistress And how does that feel... in your mouth? It feels good...Mistress Well This isn't how I imagined we'd arrive but, we're here, right? Yeah Right Listen, things aren't going to go back to the way they were, all right? They're just not Laura: Leave it at the door! Get the fucking door. Jesus As I live and breathe And to what do I owe this soon to be... displeasure. Huh? You're always such a fucking optimist. -Oh, I'm only kidding dear It's always nice to see you two I gather you are some kind of lesbian now? Help yourself You don't mind, do you? I do mind. But I'm afraid of your kind so, go right ahead Just watch it Bobbi, take it easy I'm cool. All right? I'm calm When'd you cut your hair? Looks good I knew you were the runt of the litter. But I never imagined you'd turn out to be this crass, dearie Yeah. Well, you know. Life's full of surprises. -Would you just lay off her? She's had a rough day, all right We heard about Mom, and we just wanted to make sure you were ok That right? Yeah Well as you can see. the place is kind of empty now My sister was all I ever had Much like you two have each other You're a riot. They were just like us, Sammy. -Just like us. -Exactly like us Well you might not care but, she meant something to me, Goddamnit Why would we not care? Like, like how could we possibly not care? Well, I don't see why you would You were nothing but a tax write-off. -Fuck you. -Jesus Christ It was always so easy to get to you. -Yeah well all the men in the town thought the same thing about you Half the men in this town feel whatever I want them to feel. The other half didn't make the cut, sweetie Rest assured, it was not the other way around There's no use. -I know. Listen to your sister Now really, enough of this It's just too easy. What do you want? How'd she die? You know we weren't doing... it was just another night Carol had it in her that... she wanted to listen to that song You know-- that "Johnny 99" "But the cover" she kept saying. Had to be the Cash cover She said "Now you take the boss, and you put him in the same room with my man, the Man in Black. Well, there's no limit to what I might do in those circumstances" "I might not help if it turns out I felt extremely generous!" I said to her "It's just a cover, darling. Who said anything about a room? Much less, one with you in it!" Of course you can guess what she said She said "A girl can dream!" -Yes. yes She said that just about every other sentence Oh. You two... make me sad Almost like you didn't know her at all. -Well, we were nothing but a tax write-off Oh, that's no excuse! She must have played that song about ten times You know how a little bump made her dance all night She was up... She was flying We didn't do anything out of the ordinary Smoothie came by, asked about you, by the way Smoothie's still around, huh? Oh, yes. You should see. He hasn't aged a bit Those dark skin fellas never age. They'll outlive us all, I can promise you Well he still remembers you And I always knew that you always liked a bad boy I'm surprised you ever paid attention Yeah Well, honey, there's a limit. You can have a dark one... or a pusher. But if you go on having both, you can guarantee you'll end up the team mascot And that's the kind of thing that only goes well in your head Not enough water in the Pacific to wash that shame off Fuck No. Now that's... That's really excellent advice I don't even know what to say to you Well you could just finish the story, but listen if you have any more advice-- --Well I disappeared for a... bit I got to watching some video, on the YouTube. You know how they just suck you in I left the room for 20 tops The song stopped playing and I called her name Didn't hear a thing She was... Well, she was just not herself Something else entirely There was...nothing I could have done There was nothing I could have done You believe me. Don't you, dearie? Where is she? Oh I- I keep her over there, by the cassettes Figured I'd put her in that royal blue she always loved to wear She's just about the loveliest thing I have in this house The only damn thing worth anything Hey, um. Where do you keep the Xanax? Excuse me, girls. I'm just gonna go wash up Ready? Go! Bobbi stop looking for the shit. -Ok! -Let's just go! Go, go, go, go We got it! -Shh! Wait!

She'll come back... -No Yeah! -I'm gonna lose her. -No you're not. -Yeah. -God you're such a fucking worry wart Just calm down, allright? Let's just chill here for a second All right. Ok. Just breathe Breathe We got Mom back, right? Huh? Think she ever loved us? Mom? Fuck. I guess it doesn't matter. -I don't think it matters They were really close, huh? I guess so Who cares Who cares about any of this. God You wanna just put her back? Yeah Can you go 'cause my leg is still fucked up Did we fuck up again? No... No. All right? Tt's gonna be all right. We just gotta let bygones be bygones You gotta stop feeling sorry for yourself. Allright, Bobbi? You fucked up, but you'll get over it No, I hurt her Sam. I really hurt her. -I know I know but... You'll make it up to her You guys are solid. Anyone can see that I'm so sorry. I know that's not enough I know that I made a terrible mistake Is this how you feel when I disappoint you? No You're perfect I'm fucked up. I crossed a line Have I ever crossed a line with you? No. All you've ever done is keep me from falling apart Things with Sam, they're not... Well, they're just not like other things I can't be composed around her It's like I'm flailing But I could have done it for you. It's not us It's just a thing that happened All I've ever wanted to do was keep you from these ugly things Yeah, things got ugly... But in a way it was kind of beautiful because it was you who made me feel this way Is everything beautiful in your eyes? Everything's beautiful in my eyes when you're in front of me Would you hurt me? No. Never No. I mean- I want you to I'm just so fucked up. I need to... Balance things out physically Ok. Ok. Ok!
