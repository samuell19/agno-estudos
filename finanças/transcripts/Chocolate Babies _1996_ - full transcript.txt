Councilman. Good morning. Councilman, the pig dog ass. What did you call me? No, what did you call her? I called her pig dog because cunt bitch whore takes too long. Let the record show that 91% of AIDS babies are black or Latino. You blocked the health care measures. What's up with that? Let the record show people of color die faster and in disproportionate numbers. You block treatment to the people. There's death in the street and blood on your hands. We want AIDS hospice and health to this district now. We're dying and you're doing nothing. Call my office... We want needle exchange for drug users. We die, you do nothing. You're deadlier than the virus. We are black faggots with a political agenda. We your worst nightmare. Who do you think you're talking to? A murderer! And we gonna fight you to the death. ♪ Party time ♪ Boo! Ah! La la la la la. Mmm. Some folks got AIDS and some folks got Magic Johnson disease. Folks with Magic Johnson disease is innocent victims. Well, I ain't got Magic Johnson disease and I ain't got Ryan White's disease. I got AIDS, dammit and I got it by sucking dick, getting fucked and sticking needles in my arm and the government doesn't give a shit. I am not innocent. I was never innocent, but I am strong. Just picture it. If I was a weak woman, I'd be out killing mother fuckers. No, that's where you're wrong. This goes far beyond freedom of protest. This goes far beyond freedom of expression. This goes far beyond even simple assault and battery. This is attempted murder and while I appreciate the expressions of sympathy that have been conveyed by the mayor and the police commissioner, I will not be satisfied until these people are found and brought to justice. You'll have to excuse me, we're running late. Thank you all very much. Repeating our top story. Councilman Melvin Freeman was attacked by faggots outside his Greenwich Village home this morning making it the third attack in as many weeks by this gang of self-proclaimed raging, atheist, meat-eating, HIV positive, colored terrorists. So I had him up in the bed and that juicy Latin dick was just a swinging. So I unzipped it and girl, the meat just fell out. So when you woke up what happened? It's true. Believe it. I put my teeth marks on him. Dear, can't you just spray like the other animals? Oh, please, just 'cause you never actually got the knack of classic dick sucking... Oh, hooker I will suck a dick 'til the head caves in and the balls scream mercy. And you know I'll cut your heart out to get to some dick. I know you won't. You know I will. I bet you should. You know I could. I bet you did. Oh, please. Girl, for someone so gorgeous, you sure don't know how to work it. You'd look so stunning in girl drag. I just can't think what I'd do with you, though. Max, did you think about what I said? Said what? Max, did you think about what I said? What he say? You so cute! Come on, it could work. He trusts me implicitly. We could sneak in his office. We could drug him. I even bought chloroform. Wait a minute, you want us to kidnap a politician? I want us to kidnap Melvin Freeman. You're such a rotten child. When I was giving birth to you, I should have crossed my legs and inhaled! Lucy, you know you just wanna get Freeman so you can work some trade. like the rest of us. We're talking about the real AIDS acquisition files. Look out, Dan, a flows in a tizzy. I'm the one who works there. I'm the one who knows what's going on. Yes, but you're not the one who knows what's going on in the real world, Sam. Let's get real. Trade, all he wants is trade. I know this'll work. I know if you'll only trust me. No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Brava! No. That was awful what you just did. Look, that's all I got to say on the subject, okay? Will you just think... Washroom trade. Central palm trade. Prospect for trade. Washington Square Park trade. I know this'll... Grand Central Station trade. He only trusts me. The World Trade Center. bathroom trade. Honey, to the death, to the death. Just call it what it is. It's dick, honey. Hey! Hello, sweetheart. Say hello to your worst technical nightmare. I know you missed me. Wanna take away some more of my rights? Give me a kiss. Show me you love me. Who here is HIV positive? Come on. Don't disappoint me. Well, I've got news for you. What? We are all HIV positive. Tell 'em, girl. You and you and you and you and your brothers and your sisters and your mothers and all your chillens. AIDS is number one on the charts as the number one killer of black women. I am Jamela and HIV positive. Positively dangerous when I'm pissed so don't try it. Move, Silas, I don't want to hear that. We are going to church this Sunday. Boy, don't you be talking to me like that. Don't be rolling your eyes at me like that. Boy, what is wrong with you? This is Sunday and every Sunday I have to go through this. I don't want to hear it no more, you hear me? We are going to church and I don't wanna know anything about it. Larry, hmmm. We are going to church. Now, if you wanna come along, you can go upstairs and get yourself a tie and come on, otherwise, keep your cocksucking ass here. You call yourself a church lady and talking about cocksuckers, you should be... Well, that is what they do with it. You old woman. Who are you calling old, honey? You! Who am I standing in front of? Honey, I do not wanna hear... A big old sinner, that's what you are! You ain't nothing but a sinner. But you can't even... You big sissy, you. You can call me whatever you want to. Big old sinner. Sinner, sinner, sinner, that's what you are. The biggest sinner in Harlem. I will see you Thanksgiving. Fine, I'll bring the turkey. Step up. Maybe we should carry him.

Poor little Max. I must have been what, about nine years old and you used to chase me 'round and 'round the kitchen table beating me with the frozen dinners. Dinners, that's right. You used to chase me up that tree in the back yard. I used to have to wait there for hours for you to cool off Dada. Don't you remember that? No, sir, I don't remember that. Of course you don't remember that. Three dresses, one for the kitchen, one for church and one for bed. That's all Mama could have. Now how could a woman live in three dresses? Not so. Could you live... Oh, yes it was so, Dada. How could a woman live in three dresses her whole, and you were making so much money, Dada. Hand over fist. Really, me and Jamela saw your paystubs on the bureau. Jamela, Jamela, where is your baby? Don't bring the baby to see me. I thought I told you. She's staying with Aunt Flo. With Aunt Flo? Yeah, she's been there... You don't love your baby. Of course I love my baby. I just had some things to take care of. I had some things to attend to. There's nothing more important for a mother to attend to than to suckle her child... Shut, up let me handle this. You don't know what is more important for a mother to do for her baby. I had to leave her with Aunt Flo because it was the best thing for her. She is healthy. She is well-loved. And I care about her. Day when there would be war over baby. A little child shall lead them. There you go off again, please. I'm going to pray for you. I'm going to pray that God will show you the way... Yeah, well... And I will pray for you too, Maxwell so that when you have your children, God will show you the right way not to leave your children with other people and not to take care of them... Oh Lord, I pray and I pray that I'm so glad my children are healthy and good... Dada, Dada, Dada, Dada, Dada. I think that's enough praying. In a related story, 23 gay and lesbian activists were arrested during a city hall sit-in accusing the government of secretly compiling comprehensive lists of all HIV positive people in the Tri-State area.

New York City remains both fascinated and outraged by the bizarre gay terrorists who are ultimately described by their victims as ugly black women, overdressed homos or freaks. This morning the police detained several leaders of local gay activist groups and although all denied knowledge and responsibility for the attacks, many pledged support of the gay gang's activities. Later, the mayor issued a city-wide alert for the immediate apprehension of quote, "This bunch of colored fags". ♪ You can move on outta here ♪ Oh, come on baby, what's the problem, huh?

We can't prove it yet... The AIDS acquisition files, you heard of them? Uh huh. So, you want the government knowing who you are, and where you are and who you fucking, when you fucking, what your HIV status is even before you do? Hell no. To the death. To the death. What's this?

Fight to the death, my children, to the death. Ghetto. Before we start, I want to ask something. Last week I pushed very hard to organize a nice political reception for us with pizza and performances and such and I got the go ahead to do the groundwork, then come to find out you ordered the idea to be killed. Now, what I wanna know is why should I spend time at these meetings giving all this creative input when you go ahead and do whatever the hell you feel like? I have better things to do with my time. I could have been sucking dick. Don't y'all know who I am? I am Larvetta Larvon Lavicomtess Delarva and I will be heard. Shut it down, shut it down. And I'm sick of having to work in an opium den.

Freeman is big in the AIDS acquisition scam, I can just feel it. You can just feel it? If we kidnap him and bring him here, we could force information or blackmail him. With what? I don't wanna get shot. You have no proof. I do nothing without proof, Sam. Freeman really trusts me now. Trusts you'd go right to jail. I don't wanna get jail. Not if we do it right. Why are we still talking about this? You can flap your wings all you want, honey. It ain't gonna fly. What are we talking about? We're not big medical doctors with psychological degrees. We limited queens who can barely finish a manicure. Speak for yourself. What the fuck are we gonna do with Freeman? Freeman has different sides. I've seen it. Different sides. Oh, yeah? Well, what if he resists? We'd have to beat him up. Oh, don't worry. Sam can just monologue him to death. You've all got no respect. No respect for me as a gay Asian militant.

So control your body by not fucking. What? I said control your body by not fucking and face the consequences of your actions. Pregnancy is a consequence? Yep. Is rape a consequence?

He's forced to do things he hates. I mean, that whole AIDS hospice... See, my thoughts on the AIDS hospice is simply this: why should we allow them to force another AIDS hospice on this community? We're not the only place in the city that has AIDS. They have AIDS on the upper east side. Nobody's trying to force an AIDS hospice down their throat. They have AIDS down in Battery Park City. Nobody's trying to give them an AIDS hospice. You see, the more we allow them to turn this community into a AIDS ghetto, a dumping ground for people with AIDS, it takes away from our ability to serve other people in other ways. I mean, what about day care and housing, senior citizens? And there are other ways to serve people with AIDS. You know, we didn't cause this disease. Why should we have to bear the brunt of it? Melvin's gonna help us get the AIDS acquisition files. But you have to trust him. You have to trust me. Max? Max, what do you say, Max? Suck my dick mother fucker. Suck my dick. Yeah, yeah. You're a sick person, Max. You're a sick person. Oh damn. You should be a doctor. You have this fucking fantastic diagnostic ability. Let me get this player. Come on, Freddie, give me a player. Come on, let's go. I want to hear, I'm all ears. I'm all ears mother fucker. All ears. Max, please. Bitch, it's left goddammit, left. I know when I'm right, Lawrence and it's right. Don't you dare go there. How dare you speak to your vicomtess like that? It's left, you bitch. And where's your glasses? You can't see worth a damn. When was the last time you were up in Harlem, Miss I'm Wearing My Knockoff Donna Karan sunglasses. Don't you dare go there. It's left, goddammit, left. Where are we? Max. Please. Would you shut the fuck up? What? Where are we? Oh. You were right, I'm sorry. Sorry? Well, how sorry do you want me to be? Didn't you call me bitch? I'm sorry. Well, it's just that your "I'm sorry" is so much less emphatic than your "bitch". Where is my chiffon scarf? No, Kappa girls are alright. It's those Gammas you gotta watch out for. Wait, wasn't it a Kappa who wrote an article in Essence magazine about black women having to share black men? What? No, seriously. Apparently there's this shortage of black men so us black women have to start doubling up. Oh, that's ridiculous. It is girl. There is no biblical reference for such nonsense. You girls can find all the good black men you need and you don't gotta downgrade yourselves, either. All you gotta do is go to prison. That's not downgrading yourself? No, I'm serious. Prison is the only place where... Maxwell, Larry. It's been a while. My stoop isn't used to such a gathering but find yourselves a seat. So, Maxwell, what brings you and your friends up this way? One guess. Oh come on, now. Can't you be civil to your Aunt Flo? This is between Jamela and me, okay, that's it. Oh no, oh no, that's not it at all. Why'd you have to bring your entourage? No, you've always relied on Jamela to be your strength. Well, now you gotta learn by yourself. Well look, if you could just keep your dime store philosophy to yourself, okay? Max, respect. I'm sorry, I just wish it wasn't Wednesday, you know? It's just that in African traditions, you know Wednesday's a bad day to make any decisions. Has something to do with the energies and the moon and the chakras. It's just always better to make a decision on Thursdays. Max, you know my answer. I'm your brother. And I'm your sister. I don't have time or patience. If I get cancer, if it moves into my cervix, it's different for a man. It's just that Jamela needs some time to be with herself and Zalea. You can understand that. I mean, come on. You oughta be able to. You're always tripping off into some fantasy land, dragging Jamela down with you. You probably could use some rest yourself. Look, look, there is no time for rest, okay? You're always finding some cause to fight, but really the only cause you're fighting is yourself. Max it's time to come home. It's time for home. Yeah, right. It's been a pleasure to meet you. You did the right thing, girl. How could you let him leave? How could I let myself stay? To feel like I feel. Nina, Nina, where is she? Right or wrong. Nina, where is she? You know I don't have time... I just see you. Nina. 'Cause you made me love you. Hey, hey, mother fucker. Get the fuck off. Nigger, who the fuck you think you are? That's my bitch, nigger. That your bitch, that's your bitch, nigger? Fuck out of my face mother fucker. No baby, you gotta pay. This here's a capitalist society. Come on, come on. Pull yourself up, come on. Ooh, I feel so good. Ooh, so good. Yeah, yeah honey. Look, relax yourself. Relax? Relax yourself. Why should I relax? You relax, you relax mother fucker. You relax. What are we gonna do about her? Liz, don't worry about it, shit. I just want to kill me somebody. You hear me, girl? I just want to kill me somebody. Tell 'em, girl. Shoot, I'm strong. Tell me who. Who? Who? You, you, you mother fucker. You, you, him. No, it's not gonna work no more. Please, I need some shit. You gotta help me out. Careful Nina. Get the fuck off. Max, wait. Everything is fucked and me most of all. God burns in heaven and the devil freezes in hell and what difference does it make, huh? You know? What difference does it make? Maybe after all is said and done, maybe when all this shit is over, there'll be a little bit of love left for me. And I will know just what to do with it. Get out of my way. It's day two in the mysterious disappearance of Councilman Melvin Freeman. His secretary reports Mr. Freeman left work for a dinner engagement Tuesday night and has not been heard from since. You'll remember the councilman had recently been victim of two faggot attacks by the notorious drag queen gang that has been rampaging the city and still remains at large. Mel. Douglas. Thanks for coming. I really appreciate it. Blink, mother fucker and you die in the dark. I heard you got my name on your list. Well now, I got yours. Alright, everybody drop your tools.

This, he's my lover, we're freaks, you help people and that's it? What happened to medical school? I hated it. I gave the money to Max. To him? Oh, Sam you, oh Sam. I've worked so hard to send you to medical school. Now, what happened? What happened? Sam, you were such a wonderful baby. Everything you did was wonderful. Everything you touched turned to gold... I still am, Ma, I still am. I know you still are, dear, and the best thing for you to do is just to get away from these people and go back to medical school, alright? If you don't like the school, if you don't like the school you're going to... No, Ma, I want... You can go to any other school. You want to go to Europe? I'll send you to Europe, alright? Alright? Just get away from these people. Ma, Ma... They're a bad influence on you. I want to go to Manila. Manila! Are you crazy? Manil... God! Sam, I tried to get out of there and we're here. We're fine now, alright? I don't want you to go to Manila, alright. Ma! No, the thing to do is to get away from these people, I want these people out of here... Ma, I love you. And you go to school. Ma, I love you. I love you too, and that's not the point. Alright, alright all you people, come back in here. Pick him up and take him out of here. I want you freaks out of here. You people turned my son into a faggot! He's not a fag! Alright, just get out of here! I want you out of here right now. Pick up all your dirty things and get out of here and don't come back!

February 21st. Nina Simone's birthday. Oh, a cunt to the end. She kept lecturing me on and on and on and sending me to the store for candy. Can you image the vicomtess going to the store for candy? Oh, but she was okay. She had her family around to see her off, and Flo's got her baby. Did she get my letter? I don't know. But she wished you well. She did. Lady Marmalade was killed, too. When they found her in the hotel room, strangled under the bed, the only thing holding her head to her shoulders was skin. Creole Lady Marmalade. Dear God. And your boyfriend is now Congressman. But you outed him. Ha! That was a happy day for her. Oh, sister denied nothing and lept all over the liberal middle road gate ticket and really tear the roof off a sucker.
