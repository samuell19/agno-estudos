There is a great debate going on across this country about the use of cannabis. Is it harmful, or is it not? Does it lead to heroin or does it not? I can tell you with certainty, that in fact, it does. It's been my own experience that I've never known a user who was not also a pusher. Pushers and suppliers are meeting a demand, be like prohibition days. You can knock off lots of bootleggers but they kept springing up over and over again. There certainly is good reason to believe that marijuana is habit forming. Marijuana does damage to the brain and intellect. All kinds of people use it. I know a couple of cabinet ministers, other politicians, executive assistants. All kinds of professional people, who use it, or have used it. We feel that marijuana kills ambition, kills the desire to work, the desire to progress. Where do you stand with the law, if you're caught? You can get up to seven years for possession. If you happen to give some to a friend and it can be proved, you can get up to life in prison in Canada. We will certainly wait for the final report of the LeDain Commission before making the final decision on that. And there has been no decision made yet to legalize marijuana, and the government still has that decision ahead of it. Hey I tried some of this yesterday. Did you have a good trip? I saw God. Cool, what's she look like? Haha. Funny. Hey! You wanna go for a ride, beautiful? Hey! Giuseppe! I wasn't talking to you, sweetheart. Nice car. Everything cool here, Mare? Yeah, it's cool, Tony. Giuseppe was just about to leave. Take care, Mary. See ya, Tony. Lucky. No such thing. Say what? We take care of each other. Street karma. Child, I've been doing this gig since I was about your age. It's been bent from the get go. So get lost. Do yourself a solid and go home. I'm sure your parents love you and want you back. Sell out. There's a Greyhound station two blocks up on your right. Go home, sunshine. Okay. Later? Later. Tommy, what the fuck? - Before you say anything... - No, I'm gonna say it. How dare you, give that dork Randy the job in Victoria? I have been working here since my first year of college, he failed his paralegal exams, twice. You know how bad I wanted to move out there, how bad I wanted that job. It wasn't just up to me to decide, HR felt that you wouldn't be... reliable. Based on what? Look at you. You're very smart, very pretty young thing. Thing? Oh, come on. Don't start with that women's lib crap of yours where everything I say is offensive to you broads these days. Well, no offence taken. We just felt you'd be a likely candidate to leave us. Our past experience shows that after about 4 years, and after all the training and resources... Tommy, you know I don't believe in marriage. I don't want kids, I never will, so what the fuck. I tried, Jane. You're just gonna have to be patient, "the times, they're changing". More like, "won't get fooled again", jerk. Excuse me, hey! I'm your boss. Not anymore. I quit. Hi Jane. So sorry I'm late, I know I said it before, but it won't happen again, I swear. I'm outta here. I can no longer cover for you, I'm sorry. What happened? It's a long story. I'll tell you the next time we have drinks. You must be John. Yes, have a seat, Doctor Fincher. Barry. I took the liberty of ordering you a drink. Oh, no, no, no. I don't drink. Oh. Then I hope you don't mind that I also took the liberty of ordering us some food. I assume you eat. I'm diabetic and have to eat at certain times, and you are... 12 minutes late. Yeah, I got lost. You know that there's two Danforth's that run into each other? Thank you. So I've heard some good things about you. Right on. You one of those vegetarian types? Yup. Why am I here exactly? Well, as you know, I'm one of the managers of the Ontario Addiction Research Foundation. That's ironic. I heard you were a smartass, but very good at what you do. I am looking for a young researcher who can blend in with the counter culture, speak their lingo. An insider. You mean rat them out. How did you find me? A colleague of mine told me about a brilliant young sociologist. Moi? You tell Jimbo I say hi. He told me about a fascinating field study you did at Rochdale. Communal living at its best. We'd like to do a similar study on marijuana users and the disastrous effects they're having on our youth, making them counter productive, turning them on to heroin. You know that pansy Trudeau has a secret agenda to legalize the shit. Right. And I'm guessing that's not your agenda. This ain't how I operate, brother. I'm a behaviorist. A what? We observe and learn, just let it happen. If your fix is in, don't waste your money on any research or my time. Fair enough. The A R F needs to know more about this pandemic and we are very well-funded, so you might wanna just "let it happen". Think about it. No harm in thinking, brother. How's it feel? It's a wall toke AND a super toke, at the same time, I call it a... wall - super toke. Wicked, that's the joint. There'll be a lot of narcs at the Temptations concert tonight. They never search me there, afraid of the Fro don't you know. I can't believe you're taking Jazmine. You don't like soul cause you don't got none. My girlfriends think you dance like an old white man with a hemorrhoid. What do them birds know? I got into Pennbrook. Good for you. I promise I'll be home every other weekend and next year... A lot can happen in a year. I know, you're right, Mooch. Thank you. I loved your undergrad thesis and your innovative use of Behavior Modification. Thank you professor, your feedback was invaluable. Appreciate that but it was your crazy idea to use mature male rat urine high in MUPS as a Positive Reinforcement to attract the females. Whatever turns them on. What? Nothing, professor. Adam. Here's the lowdown. I'm snagging a staff of doctors, nurses, researchers, junior researchers. Because ARF's throwing a lot of green to study the effects of green. I don't follow. Pot, skunk, ganj, you catch my drift? They're funding studies on the social and physical effects of marijuana. Cool. We are using young women first. Studying the effects of weed on them and how it alters their minds, bodies and productivity. It's never been done before, which means... You could get published. Right on. Before Premier Robarts left office, he caught wind of Trudeau and his federal government's plan to legalise the shit. The Ontario government loathes street drugs. So they're dropping a pile of dough to do studies like mine. Okay. I follow. Old people are already freaking out over would happen. Which is why my new boss, John hired me. Between you and me, he's hoping for the worst. It sounds like he wants you to skew the results. Bingo. But as behaviorists, you know... We let the data speak for itself. Exactly. Welcome to Project Venus. Thank you. Janice, honey, do me a favor and take out the trash? Sure, Mom. Thank you, sweetheart. Oh, and I hope you don't mind, I found a batch of your brownies at the back of the fridge and I helped myself. Yeah, no problem. Your Nana can't wait to see you tomorrow, she loves to hear all about your travels. You know, she never left Toronto in her whole life. I mean ever. Would you look at that. My arthritis medication must be kicking in. My wrists feel great. I feel great. I feel grateful and those brownies were so good. They were delicious, and I would really love to have... well, I forget what I was gonna say. Oh, I love this. Oh! Come on, come on, baby. Yeah. Mom, I think you're stoned. You're funny. No, I just had, well I had 2 glasses of wine with dinner but I'm fine, sweetheart. I'm fine. No. The brownies. That's what I was gonna say. I want the recipe for those brownies. It's your recipe but there's a special ingredient that I brought back from Morocco. Oh shit. I'm stoned. Oh blarney, I'm stoned. It's not funny, don't tell your dad. So you haven't said, how are the girls? The Missus is good, and she misses you. Becky is great, she just placed second in the nationals, should have won, but next time. Oh and she got offered several track scholarships. Good for her. After her pre med, I'm hoping she follows the old man's footsteps. Heaven knows we could use another shrink in the house with the Missus perimenopausal and all. How is Joan otherwise? Oh, she's fine. I have some good news for us. Well, I like good news. I have a contract to consult with a cannabis research project involving 18 to 25 year old females. That sounds interesting. And I'm bringing you along. I got you a spot on the nurses' team. Thank you. It's mostly observing, and assisting the G.P. But the money is good, and you were mentioning that your cousin... Mae. Mae, and you are saving up for a house, so the timing is good. How is she, by the way? No complaints. It's good that you have each other's company. Yeah, it is. Listen, thank you for looking out for me. Of course, we're a team. Hi. Can I help you? Do you have the Chi Lites new album? Ah, nope. When are you getting it in? The man says you have to order it and pay for it in advance. That's bogus. Yeah, we don't carry a lot of black type music here. Supply and demand. If you think us black types are going to pinch it, you could keep copies behind the counter. Tell that to the man. Will do. What a tool. I'll order it for you. My parents won't be back from the movie for another two hours. You wanna come over? You have parents? I promise you'll meet them. When? Soon. We've been hitchin for 3 months and I've never met them, because you're embarrassed. That's not true. Besides, whenever I've been at your joint, your dad's always working. I've never met him. True. Take care. The prick fired you, didn't he? I hate to pile on, but Terry said you can't use our place as a crash pad anymore. The timing sucks, I know. Hey, don't worry. You've done enough, don't worry. I do. You need to get off the street, Mary. You're going to run out of luck. Luck? You know what I mean. I could use some luck, a change, a big change. Wait, I have something. I thought about it for myself, but Terry would never go for it. Basically you smoke weed and get paid for it. What's the catch? There's always a catch. Are you high, Jan? No, don't answer that. It's only 98 days, Mom. I know. But your dad and I always worry about you when you're on your adventures. And now I guess we'll worry about you when you're what, a stoner in Toronto? Well, I kind of am. Why? Why this, why now? Money. I need money to pay off my travel debts, a clean slate. Your dad and I can help. No. I want to do this on my own. I promise, after this, I'm gonna chill out. Fine. Fine. Just be careful. Hey, I survived the Moroccan coup. Don't remind me. So, how bad can this be? Do you have any pre-existing health issues? Nope. Asthma? Nope. Are you allergic to anything? No. Have you ever had or have any mental health issues? No. Have you ever taken, or are you taking any non-prescriptive drugs for recreational purposes? Sorry? Street drugs. A little bit of pot. I'm pretty boring so far, aren't I? You realize part of this study you will be required to consume daily doses of marijuana. I'm aware. This isn't on the screening questionnaire, I'm just curious, what is your main motive to do this? Money. I'm trying to save up enough money to open my own company. I design graphics for this big firm and now I want to go it alone. I just turned 25, I feel like it's now or never. Sounds neat. Neat? I meant, cool. Are you married? Nope. Good. All of our subjects aren't allowed to be married. The study involves several months of isolation from your friends and family. We don't want to lose anyone and compromise the integrity of the project. The only correspondence allowed is through posted mail, we screen them both in and out. That's creepy. No, not really, it's just to protect the secrecy of the project. Still creepy. Welcome, everyone, I'm psyched to have you on the team. This will be our young ladies' home for the next 98 days, hence the family rec room vibe for a more natural environment. Cool. And we are their guests. They're volunteers, not our patients or prisoners but... They're not allowed to leave the building for the next 98 days. Hey Mary. Thanks for the tip. This is going to be the best job EVER. I hope so. As part of the Operant Conditioning, their Positive Reinforcement is moola. Their Negative Reinforcement is marijuana. Our job is to blend and observe, hence the casual dress code. We are to have no preconceived notions, make no judgements. We do not want to influence their behavior, or productivity in any way. So just blend. Bye. Bye, Mom. We are here to collect data, and study the physiological and sociological effects of the cannabis as well as their spending habits in this Token Economy. No pun intended. Hey, I'm Joanne. Mary. Come here, I'm a hugger. We're gonna have a blast. Um, do you mind if we switch beds, I don't like being near windows, cause of the traffic, you know, it can be a bit noisy. Maybe they can find us a fan. I brought extra ear plugs, if you want them. Cool. You will be smoking marijuana, twice a night for the next 98 days. The other girls are in the control group, no pot luck for them, they get nothing and love it. Your room is on the man but you are responsible for your own meals, clothes and supplies. Your expenses will be deducted from your income making... Macrame. How you spend and how hard you work will determine how much bread you keep getting out of here. These works of art must pass quality control and you shall receive two dollars and 50 cents for each. The staff is here to observe, and compile data, just ignore them, soon you won't even know they're there. Alright ladies, look what I got. Smuggled! So I figure I'll clear... You never smoked before. What? You lied just to get in here and make some bread. No, no, no, no. Hey, it's cool. That's right, it's dope. We roomies gotta stick together. Thanks, Mary. Hold it like this. Okay. Small inhale. Hold. Then big exhale. Nice. So where was I... oh ya, so I figure I'll clear 3200 and then I'm on the first plane out of here. Very cool, where ya heading? Victoria. There's a co-op out there I want to check out. I feel like it's the right vibe for me. Sweet. I'm planning to go to university for some higher learning. Got jammed this year, so. Hey, don't Bogart. Hey! Right on, Mo. Me, I got some travel baggage I gotta unload, if you know what I mean. What about you, Mary? Huh? I don't know. I just came here for some perspective, to peace out, you know, maybe make some... Money! Mary, sit down, please. What's up? I noticed, Mary, when I was looking at your application, that you don't have a home address and there's no one listed under contacts. Is that a deal? You tell me. Just so you know, I volunteer at Youth Services and spend a fair bit of time counseling street teens. I'm twenty one. I'm aware, I started working at the center after my second daughter Becky was born. Nifty. Thank you. I didn't realize when I started working there how bad it was. Life out there, the drugs, the predators. Sure beats the alternative. I know a lot of them come from abusive homes. What's with the flashback? If you don't mind me asking, when is the last time you had contact with your parents? We done? Listen, Mary, one of the rewarding things about working there was reuniting families as part of the healing process. Mighty righteous of you. Okay, well, I'm here for you if you want to talk, about anything. You can trust me. I don't trust anyone over thirty. Abbie Hoffman. Actually, Jack Weinberg, wrong Jew. Oh, and if you don't hear from me, take it personally. Hello Mary. We decided to make a little switcheroo. We moved Joanne to the control group, kind of a bummer, but it's for the best. Marissa meet Mary, Mary, Marissa. Hi. Fuck this, I can't do it, man. At this rate I'll be lucky to get one done today. I'll go broke. You'll get the hang, don't sweat it, Mare. Easy for you to say. Okay, look. You take these 4 cords, make a four, go under, over, pull, and then you do it again on the other side. Is this some square hobby of yours? When I taught English in Peru, the home ec teacher showed me, there wasn't a lot to do up in the mountains. Until I met Jorge, or as I affectionately referred to him, Hungay. He digs you. What? The boy. He keeps checking out your knockers. Nice girls, by the way. He's cute, you should go for it. I don't really know him. Plenty of time for that, we're gonna be here for three months, that is a long time without shagging. Mm-hmm. I'm just here to make money. Mm-hm. Hubba hubba. We may not like bearded hippies but they are in fact, a product of our society. We may not like too much talk about drugs but they are a fact that has to be faced. Good evening ladies, it's eight o'clock, also known as toke time. Thank you. No dice, Jane, we need to quantify each individual's intake. Okay. Everyone inhale it deep into your lungs, hold for five seconds and then exhale. And repeat. See you all in fifteen for round two. Pretty mello yello, man. I can't believe we get to smoke this shit and not get busted. Crazy. When I woke up in a warm bed this morning I had to pinch myself. Karma, Mary, you're due sister, you're due. How many times you toked, Ma? Hey. For fuck's sakes, just sit down, would ya. I'm not supposed to interact, I'm supposed to blend in the background and observe. So sit here and blend. Okay. So, who'd you rather hang out with, Franken Berry or Count Chocula? Huh... Franken Berry. Why? Social outcasts make more loyal friends, he's funny and he got a bad rep on that pink stool deal. I forgot about that. Imagine, all those mothers freaking out thinking their kids got rectal bleeding, it's hilarious. And pink is my favorite color, but please don't tell anyone. You've thought about that before, haven't you? Yeah. It can get pretty boring around here. Tell me about it. It's just the nature of behaviorism. I much prefer the analytics part cause I get to see all that rad data. It's fun. Right on. I prefer Count Chocula, he is cute, rather "neat" for a cartoon character. Thank you so much for asking. And pink is my favorite color too, but you can tell whoever you want. Bitchin family you got there. Thank you, they are. Becky here is going to university in the fall. Good for her. I promised my dad that I would be the first person in our family to go to university, not as easy as for some of us. He was saving for me, but then couldn't anymore. So I didn't want to give up on our dream, so in my senior year of high school, I got a gig on an assembly line. Did you have to drop out of school? No, I took the four to midnight shift. That's very admirable of you. I had to quit the track team, give up on seeing friends. So one day this honkey in a suit shows up at our work and starts observing us, "quality control". The company was making record sales and my shift was number one, don't you know. So one day the goon calls me into his office and cans me, says I was lazy. I begged him for my job, I told him about university, he could give a shit. So that's why I'm here, so I can make enough cash that I don't have to miss another year. I'm sorry to hear that. You know, when patients tell me these anecdotes, I always ask them to look at themselves and ask themselves, "What could I have done differently, what mistakes did I make that I could learn from?" The only other workers that got fired at the plant were DeShawn and Jamal. The loafs, Paul and Jeff kept their jobs. What can you learn from that? You wanna know what's funny. We made greeting cards and their logo was "We are all Heart". Ironic, don't you know. Come on, the gals are ordering pizza tonight and The Who's next album just arrived. I gotta chip in for a change. Hold up, Alice. Can I get four chips to go? Thank you. Oh no, it's okay, I'm not that hungry. What goes around comes around. Karma. Thanks. I'm good for it. I know. You mean to tell me the smoking group is outperforming the control group? Crazy, I know. Both sides have their over and under achievers but on average, the stoners have made more bread then the sober gals so far. So far? Is this turning into a waste of taxpayers' money? You can never waste taxpayers' money in the name of science. This is a ground breaking social study and we have a long ways to go. As planned, we're ready to introduce the regressor variable. Which is? Amping up their THC levels on a nightly basis so that we can do a quantitative analysis of the girls' productivity with their enhanced impairment. Are the girls aware of this? Yeah, yeah, they're cool with it, and hey, whatever floats your boat, right? Care for a drink? It's another nice day, I wish I could go for a walk. Eighty-six more days, but who's counting? You know that's part of the Clarke Institute, right? The what? They're forensic psychology patients, it's the criminally insane wing. Oh. What's he doing? He's using sign language. He says, "Hello fine ladies, can I buy you a drink?" "We have to go back to work, maybe next time" What are you doing? Are you crazy, they're crazy. I'm giving them hope. What's with the sign language, anyway? I taught at a school for the deaf in Kyoto. Of course you did. Move along, ladies. You know you're not supposed to have communication with the outside community. Lighten up, Nurse Ratched. I read the book. That's cute. Now move along. What's with the country music? Oh, it reminds me of my mom. Oh. My mom had me when she was seventeen, same age I was when she died. That's young. You know, we lived in a small town up North and her parents were, like, religious kooks. They were horrified and ashamed of her, and me. And abortion is illegal. Even if it weren't, her parents would never allow it. Instead Mom moved to Toronto, had me and we fended for ourselves. She made enough at her two jobs that we could get by. And your grandparents? Disowned us. Sounds like they need to be born again. Amen. I never even told them about Mom's cancer. Why would I? I'd rather live on the street then in their home. Proud like your Mama. Good on you, girl. It hasn't been easy, but I see this place as a new chapter, a fresh start. I already see a change in you. You're not so closed. You think? Yeah. For sure. Promise when I move out West, you'll come see me, check out the mushrooms and hang? Sounds like a plan, hippie girl. ♪ One toke over the line sweet Jesus ♪ ♪ One toke over the line ♪ ♪ Sittin' downtown in a railway station ♪ ♪ One toke over the line ♪ ♪ Awaitin' for the train that goes home, sweet Mary ♪ ♪ Hopin' that the train is on time ♪ Where do you think she learned to play like that?

What, what? What are you looking at? Stop looking at me. Munchies. You okay, Marissa? Oh, you know. What? I'm, like, new to this stuff, so I think it kinda affects me more then them, you know. Why don't I walk you back to your room? Hi Mom, it's Janice. What the fuck, Alice! I shouldn't have to tell you, you're not allowed to be doing this.

You ought to be ashamed of yourself, said Alice, a great girl like you, she might well say this, to go on... crying... You ought... No matter how ugly it got outside, I could always find inner peace. How so? The street is full of the wicked and the righteous. Darkness and light. I trusted almost no one but a few, I was drawn by their unique aura. We all shared a cosmic connection. And you call me hippie girl. We looked out for each other. Sounds like a community. Why don't you come live out West with me? I would be miserable in a hippie commune. It's a co-op. We share the land, and our food, and our skills. Share each other. Well, if you dig each other, why not? Free love is naughty. Sounds like a community? I hear ya. I guess I'm just more old fashioned. I want to find a good job and a good man. Sounds cool, but I'm never going to get married or have kids. Why not? My parents. Every year they grew further apart and more resentful of each other, and instead of talking or yelling or changing, they just... existed. It was a bad vibe to be around growing up. Why didn't they leave each other? Well, I guess they were more "old fashioned". I hear ya. I don't know, I just still believe in true love. I'm going to get married, and I'm gonna have lots and lots of kids. You want to give them the good life you never had. I never thought about it that way, but yeah. You're gonna make a great mom. Hey. Good morning, ladies. I'd like you to meet our boss, John Bradow, who is the reason we are all here. Hello everyone. On behalf of The Addiction Research Foundation, I want to thank you for your valuable time and commitment to this ground breaking project. Your contributions are immensely important to our understanding of the effects of marijuana on your gender, and they will be studied for years to come. Do any of you have questions for John? Very well then, keep on trucking. John. "Keep on trucking", what a goof. A lively group in there. They're weed wacked. What? Cannabis usually remains in your system for about eight days, but because of their regular dosing and increased THC levels, it stays with them much longer. How long? Well, the labsters estimate, it could take about 45 days to leave the blood stream entirely. So their effectively stoned all the time. Define "stoned". Their acute "buzz", lasts for about three hours, so they sleep most of that off. I guess you could say, in the day they have "weed hangover". So their productivity must be going down. Therein lies the rub. What rub? Actually, the physiological results shows their motor dexterity and neurotransmitters are slowing down. So they're becoming less productive than the control group. It depends on the individuals in both groups. They are getting better at their craft and some are even waking up earlier to counter the side effects of the ganj. Ganj? Sorry, cannabis. They're more motivated by the money despite being handicapped. Their workmanship is impressive. Far better then when they started. This is not what the foundation expected. That's why were doing this, as behaviorists, you never know how your subjects will navigate the maze. Well, your subjects are not looking too good in there, so let's not jump to conclusions. Right on, we aren't even a third of the way through, a lot can happen. Yes, a lot can happen. Bye, Doctor Fincher. Later, John. Nice. Oh. Pervs. Janice, no! Oh my god. Dream on. Let's make their day. You mean their year. Seriously, let's do it. - Really? - Yes, come on! - No, I can't do it! - Yes, come on! Okay. What in gods name is going on here? It's none of your business, Nurse Ratched. It most certainly is my business, the two of you teasing those poor deranged men. This is going on both of your records and I'm scheduling you both appointments for Doctor Harlow. I liked it better when you didn't speak. I have to put you on probation, this is your second violation. I just need some space. Maybe a walk in the daylight, even prisoners get an hour in the yard. I can't do that. You know what you signed up for, Janice. You have to exist in the micro community, no outside interaction. But I need space, everywhere I go people are following me, watching me, prodding me. My only escape is sleep and then I have nightmares. About what? That people are following me, watching me, prodding me. Do you think the marijuana has an impact on your increasing paranoia and anxiety? No, I think it's because people really are fucking with me. And how does that make you feel? Like a rat in a cage. You know what, I don't need a shrink. It's simple, I miss my mom and need a breath of fresh air. Mac and cheese and lasagna which is way too much pasta What were you saying? You spaced out there a little. - No. - Yeah. Hey. Mo, you okay? Yeah, I just hate this day. What, Sunday? No. Today is my father's birthday. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know. It used to rag on me not having a dad. I'm over it, you will be too, soon. I have a dad but don't see him much. Did he take off on you and your mom? He's in jail. Oh. Thanks for not asking why. He worked as an auto mechanic and then got a second gig delivering pizza evenings and weekends. Hard working, sounds like a good man. He is... but ironically he got busted for selling weed. Say what? The guy who owned the pizza joint peddled pot to his preferred customers. Pretty far out when you think about it. Dope and munchies, one stop shopping. At first my dad would have nothing to do with it. But he struggled to make ends meet, and was tempted. He wanted us to get ahead, I know he was thinking about his promise to send me to university. Ahhh. He never told me that, but I still feel guilty. Hey, you can't think that way. He meant well. Shit happens. The worst part is, his boss narced him out, said he didn't know my dad was a drug dealer and he had nothing to do with it. Seven years with good behavior. That's so bogus. I'm sorry, Mo. Here's the skinny. My old man goes to jail for selling dope because he wanted to help pay for my education. I'm sitting here smoking dope to pay for my education, and we're both incarcerated. Like rats in a cage. You know. My dad gets out on parole a week before I leave here. Can't wait to hug him again. You two make a nice pair. Sure, hippie girl. Ma, it's been seven weeks. Yeah, he is kinda cute. And he obviously digs you, so what's the problem? I have a boyfriend. On the outside. Okay, that sounds like we're in prison. Yeah. So what's his gig? Sean manages the Metroland Theater. Oh! The porno place? French erotica, and it pays very well. No judgement, but he's a guy, and he hasn't seen you in two months. Your point? You can't expect him to just sit around amusing himself all day. When the cats away... He writes me every day. And what's he doing the other twenty three and half hours a day? Hmm. No. I trust him. If there's anything my miserably married mother taught me, it's that you regret the things you don't do, more then the things you do, do. That's a lot of do's in there. Yeah. But I do think you dig Adam and you have good vibes, so... don't regret it. Has anyone seen Janice? She missed her weigh-in and I can't find her. I haven't seen since our eight fifteen toke. Same, she was acting weird, I think she was high. That girl is gonna cost me my job. Janice? Janice! Janice? Janice! Have you seen Janice? Shit. Janice? Janice! Yaaaaa! Ahhhhh! I am aware that I am not supposed to be judging your deviant behavior but you are all acting like a bunch of stoned, spoiled brats. Doctor Harlow will be hearing about this. I know this has been hard on you, Alice, but it would be ill-advised to interfere. As Doctor Fincher said, this is not a jail, this is their home and they're free to do as they may. They hate me. I know it's easy to take things personally, but many of these girls have emotional baggage. And I understand that. And the cannabis seems to have further exacerbated this. Then tell him to stop or at least slow down their dosing. It's not my place to do that. Imagine if that was one of your girls in there. These women know what they signed up for. No one told them and they're free to leave. Without their money. You're right. We could all use a little extra money. By the way, how's the house hunting coming along? We're still saving, can't get a loan without a man to co-sign. That's too bad. I do have some good news. What's that? Becky has been chosen valedictorian for her graduation. Oh, that is great, will you please congratulate her for me. You can do that yourself, I've decided to throw her a little party downtown at the Brown Derby next Saturday night to celebrate. You are invited and please bring along your cousin... Mae. Mae. Bring your cousin Mae along, we'd love to meet her. Thank you but we both have plans for that night, sorry. It sounds lovely. That's okay. I'll congratulate her for you. But the Missus will miss you. Dr. Fincher is on his way. Okay, ladies, what's up? Dr. Harlow told me a few of you have asked him for a doctor's note to bail on some sessions. We need a break. The weed's too much. So what, you're on strike now? As you know, if you don't comply with our agreement, you will be asked to leave. It'd be a shame to not be able to cash out. What a rip off. It's called a Positive Reinforcement, to motivate you. We're not Guinea Pigs. I hear you. Hey, we're a team here, we gotta stay the course, we're learning so much. Then we deserve answers. Tell us what's happening to our bodies. It's too soon to tell. This field work is just the beginning, then we analyze the social and physiological data and let the results speak for themselves. That's bogus. C'mon, just hang in there, girls, we're past the half way point. Thanks. If I quit, I lose my money. If we all quit, you lose everything. Your funding, your token economy will collapse and YOU will get nothin and love it. Alright. Whoever's strong enough to stay the next 46 days will be given an additional 250 dollars as a bonus. How's that for a positive reinforcement? Come in. So how was Becky's party on the weekend? Huh, oh, fine. It was actually quite nice. How was your Saturday night? It was relatively uneventful. I see. You know, Alice, I consider you much more than a terrific nurse. I consider you a good friend. Well, I feel the same way about you. Except for the nurse part. So, as a friend, is there something you want to tell me? No, why? When we were driving back from the party Saturday night, we got stuck in traffic downtown. Typical. Not really. There was some kind of event blocking Yonge Street. A protest, by a bunch of queers. I see. We saw you there, Alice, holding hands with a woman. We even saw you kiss her. That was Mae. She's not my cousin. Yes, I figured that out. Why wouldn't you tell me, as a friend? Everett Klippert. Who is that? He's my friend. He is also gay and he made the mistake of admitting it. He was incarcerated indefinitely seven years ago, when at the time it was a capital crime. He's lucky they didn't hang him. But homosexuality was decriminalized three years ago. We've come a long way, you know that. If you say so. They just released him a year ago. I see. So now you know why I didn't tell you... or anyone. It's not something I can be open about. So if you no longer wish to be my friend, then I guess I'll have to accept that. I can help you. How do you mean? I have some colleagues who are working on an exciting new treatment. Homosexuality is a mental disorder, and is curable. - Curable? - Yes! It's called Aversion Therapy. Basically, the patient is exposed to same-sex erotic imagery while receiving electroshock therapy on their... their genitals. That sounds horrific. But it recircuits the brain and orientates them towards Heterosexuality. I'm not interested. Doctor Jones has shown fifty-eight percent success rate in his clinical trials so far. This is ground breaking, you could be part of it. I don't have a mental disorder, Spencer. I don't need to be cured. But the science... No, stop judging me! My life was miserable when I felt that shame. And then I met Mae, and I have never been happier. So if you really are my friend, I would appreciate it if you would accept me for who I am. Okay. If you ever have a change of heart, I'm here for you. I won't. I had it disconnected. You! Leave me alone. Leave me alone! You can't go out there. Janice, I want you to calm down and go back to your room. You can't keep me here. Let me out. Let me out, I'm allowed to get the fuck out of here if I want to! You can't go now, it's late and you're in no state, we would be liable if anything should happen to you. Now if you don't have a change of heart in the morning, you can see Dr. Fincher and when you are of sound mind, you can be discharged. Sound mind. You make me sound like a freak. Stop judging me! I'm sorry. You are not a freak. None of this is fair. You are a scared young woman who misses her family and just wants to feel loved and safe. You understand. More than you know. Now then, let's get you back to your room. I went to wake her this morning and her bed was made, her stuff was all gone. I knew she was struggling. I just wish I'd done more to help her. I'm really going to miss her. Yeah. When I get outta here I'm giving her ten percent of my money. Fifteen. I'm in. What's wrong, Mare? Everyone I get close to ends up leaving. I tried not to get close to her, to all of you. We aren't going anywhere. You will, you all will. When this is over, I will never see any of you again. We'll all keep in touch, I promise. Says the girl moving away. You know what sucks the most? As rank as it is in here, it's the closest that I've ever come to having a family, a home. I'm afraid to leave and be alone again. Hey! Hey, remember what we talked about? Talk is cheap. Marissa, may I? How are you? Fine. I was thinking about that beautiful picture you're painting and how neat it is. Thanks. I'm no artist or anything but I think you got talent, I think your company is going to be killer. Hope so. Last night was... amazing. It was okay. You seemed more than okay when you were in the moment. In the moment? Yeah, yeah, it was fucking "neato". Let's not talk about it. Look, it's a little more than three weeks til we're done here. I was thinking we could go on a real date when you're out. Sounds like you're in prison. What are you most looking forward to? Getting away from anything to do with this place. I have a lot of work to do today, see ya later. It's two o'clock in the afternoon, you might wanna put that down. Please, not now, Alice. I need your help. Okay. Last night the Missus and I went out to see a movie, but she wasn't feeling well, she had stomach cramps, so we turned around and went home. Oh dear, is she okay? Yes, but that's not the problem. When we got home, I went to get her some Pepto from the upstairs bathroom. Becky was in her room but she didn't hear me, so I opened the door to tell her what happened and... And what? She was with someone. Oh. That could be awkward. But really, Spencer, she's going to university. At that age they get curious, you remember. Listen! It's more than that, it's much more than that. Becky has a... She has a Cousin Mae. Ah, so you're saying she's gay then. Don't say that. It's like you said, right? At this age they just get curious. It isn't a phase, Spencer. I need your help. Could you talk to her? Of course I will. She's a lovely girl. I'll do whatever I can to help. Thank you. I'd like you to tell her how awful it's been for you, the shame you carried as a young woman, the loneliness, the secrecy. No. I won't. It'll fuck her up. I would be happy to offer her my support, or hope, if you'd like. Alice, imagine if you could have changed things when you were young, if we had aversion therapy back then, how much better your life could have been. How dare you. Use my life, my sexuality as a yard stick of failure to threaten Becky with. You are going to confuse and ruin that girl. What does Joan say? The Missus was shocked but then she said she would love her no matter what. Then we had a huge fight, and I slept on that couch last night. Well then, maybe you're the one that needs therapy. How dare you, at a time like this. Oh I dare, I dare. And by the way, her name is Joan, not "the Missus". I actually feel sorry for you. There you go, sweetie. Only 13 more days of this. Did you get the note? Don't worry, I spoke to Doctor Harlow and he will be writing you and the girls a note that you were here, and that you're not heroin addicts. Those scars should fade in time. I hope so. Do you have any more orange juice? Yes. Here you are. Adam. Yeah? We should talk. Okay. I know I've been avoiding you since... Yeah. Tell me about it. It's kind of hard to do my job, I'm supposed to be observing you. I know. That night meant a lot to me, and you mean a lot to me, and I really loved all the time we spent together. But. I don't know how to say this. I'm married. I'm so sorry. I know that I've betrayed you and I betrayed my husband. I'll never forgive myself. I was part of this, too. But you didn't know. I did and should have stopped it. I'm so sorry. It's just being in here and getting to know you, it happened and I can't change it. I really like you, Adam. But you know what this means. Yeah. As a married woman I was ineligible to volunteer for the program. And I lied to you because I needed the money to open my business. And now I'm going to lose all that money and probably my husband. I'm not gonna tell. You can keep your money, start your business and the rest of your lives together. As far as your husband is concerned, it really is up to you whether he finds out or not. If things were different... But they're not. Psychology Now was keen on my pitch and are considering a periodical run as there's so much sociological and physiological data to analyze. I'm psyched! Pun intended. So what's happening with the smoking group? Definitely some side effects. Respiratory issues, short term memory lapses, lower blood pressure. That's terrible. I assume that will be included in your report. Yes, but we need to analyze all the data before we jump to any conclusions or this all becomes pseudo science. But you just said... If an elephant was given those doses, it would have had those side effects. You know Prime Minister Trudeau's Ledain Report is leaning towards not legalizing marijuana. They're concerned it would get in the hands of adolescents and it could cause permanent damage to their short term memory. That's bogus. When you're high you sometimes lose your train of thought, that's why they call it dope, but it ain't permanent at any age of brain. That sounds like first person experience. The feds at least are recommending letting first time offenders walk with a small fine and lighter sentences in general. Big mistake. Your study will help prove that. You can't dictate that agenda. We already know, no matter how much marijuana we plied into those poor women, some were still waking up at the crack of dawn to work on that gnarly macrame. The economy won't go to pot. Pun intended. Right. And you don't have an agenda? Come again? Didn't you put your ground-breaking experiment, your token economy, and your publishing ambitions, ahead of those "poor women"? They had 24 hour support, some of the best doctors and nurses in the city at their disposal, it was a safe study. If you say so. I look forward to your proposal. Say what? We only have so many resources and social policies of the province are always evolving. I thought we were fully funded. For your field study yes, for your analytics no. You'll have to apply. But what's the point of all this without the follow up? You tell me. We owe it to those women. So now you care. I don't owe anyone, anything. Hold on. I look forward to your proposal. John! That was really great of your Dad to loan us the car. Thanks so much for the lift, Becky. No worries, I'm driving Dad home now, so it all works out. And listen. Good luck in the fall at school and with your running, and I know you're gonna do great. Thanks and thanks for the chat, I really needed someone to talk to who, you know... knows what it's like. I'm here, anytime. How did it go? Really well. The Waldorf Salad was fantastic, thanks for treating. What did you talk about? The Waldorf Salad was fantastic. Alice. It's not up to me, she'll talk to you when she's ready. I guess you're right. You do have a really amazing girl there, I sincerely hope that you're proud of her. I am. Good. Alice. Thank you. We made it. Don't jinx it, hippie girl, we ain't out yet. I miss Janice. Yeah. She's probably chillin' in Chile with Hungay. So girls, what's the first thing you're going to do when you get out of here? Get laid. Figures. What? I wore out my electric toothbrush. Oh my god. Gross. Then I will get on the first plane out of here. Can't wait to go live and work at the co-op. First thing I'm going to do is hug my dad and then hopefully I'm off to York, pre law. You're so gonna get in, Mo. Don't worry about it. I'm going straight to the bank to deposit, 5352 dollars eighty-five cents. That's crazy. Then open my graphics company, courtesy of Mr. Owl. Creepy bastard. Never again. I... I don't know. I don't believe in making plans. I'll still be me, same problems, nothing's changed like I hoped. I guess I just don't want to leave or know what I'm going to do. I'll miss you guys, sorry to be depressing. It's only been a week of detox, Mare. It's probably the dope still bringing you down. I'm sure you'll feel better soon. You're right... I hope so. My dad's waiting for me outside. Goodbye, foxy ladies. See you soon, I hope. Well, no point keeping Sean waiting, he's already been waiting 98 days. I missed him. Bye Jane. Bye Mary. Hey, Leaf is picking me up. Maybe you could come with us, we could grab a bite of real food and then we could drop you... where are you headed? I'm staying at a friend's pad really close. Thank you but I can walk, get some fresh air for a change. See you out West. You promised. See you. Hello. Hey Adam. What's going on, Doctor Fincher? Those mother fucking bureaucrats turned down an extension grant for Project Venus. How can they do that? The fix was in. Bradow had concerns our data may not have the desirable results. But it's too soon. I know all this, man, and so do they. No one is more bummed than me. What about the girls, everything they were put through? They got paid. And I'm sure one day all that data will be put to good use. You want to know what all this was about? The millions Trudeau spent on the LeDain report? What? They were never going to legalize weed, they just wanted a shift in policy. I don't understand. What kind of shift? They wanted the law to cool it on possession for recreational purposes. So they proved the hysterics were bogus. No kidding, six years in the slammer is pretty harsh. Yeah, but no one cared when the blacks and petty criminals were being locked up, but now that it's gone prime time... Everyone at my school is doing it. Even me. You and millions of other suburban white kids. The politicians and judges were freaking out that it was their little Johnny getting busted and locked up. My friend couldn't even go to university because of it. Or get a job. When you graduate, look me up. I got a good gig at Rexdale Rehab in Guelph. What are you researching? Alcoholics. There's a lot of green for hooch. Booze ruins more people's lives and families then pot ever will. And it's legal. I'll give you a call. Barry, thanks again for the opportunity. Catch you on the rebound. Oh wait, one of the girls wanted me to give you something. I wonder who? I made several inquiries in the 80's and 90's. I wanted to know. I still want to know. Nobody helped, they still don't care about us. The dosages. What they found psychologically, physically. I feel ripped off, taken advantage of. It's like it didn't happen. I feel like yeah, they put us through hell, for what? Were the results that horrible that they didn't give them to us? You wonder. I have hosted several reunions of the group over the years, we're still very close and still mad as hell. In 1982 I went to the Addiction Research Foundation to ask whether a report or any information had been written up about our experiment. I was told to write a note to leave for one of the doctors whose name she'd pulled from another study. I didn't get any response. I think the study might have supported legalizing marijuana. That's why it didn't come out. I don't know. It leaves you with a lot of questions. I guess we'll never know. No one will ever know. Parliament has now passed Bill C45 which will legalize and strictly regulate access to cannabis. We will soon have a new system in place, one that keeps cannabis out of the hands of our kids and keeps profits away from organized crime. Today I'm also pleased to announce that the new recreational... It's about fucking time.
