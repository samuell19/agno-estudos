Where to? Anthony's in there. I can't leave him. I left a note. Where to? Shots fired. Drop your weapon! Get him out back, quickly. God damn it. Eight minutes till backup arrives. - You know what to do? - Sir. Scrub and remove all bodies. - Hey. - Yes, Sir? Did you find a girl? No, Sir. No female body. How's the front of the store? Scrubbed, no traces. Just like you asked. - Where's his other phone? - That's all we found on him. Okay. You want to go find it? - Yes, Sir. - Thank you. You want to try and stop the bleeding? - It's down to the bone. - Administer adrenaline. Clear for paddles. Clear. I got the cooler. Hurry. No phone. Just this. Oh, jeez. Oh, God. I'm sorry. - What was that? - His eyeball is still inside. Along with most of his face. Some of the muscle... fused to the mask. - You... you okay? - Yes, Sir. Oh, good. He's not, so why don't you... fucking stabilize him? Sorry, Sir. - Follow C-7 protocol. - Yes, Sir. The surgeons are already en route. Should I take his car and meet you there? Or you could follow C-7 protocol like I said. I'm sorry. Did I stutter? No, I did not stutter. Here, take this. Keys. Please. Keys. Thank you. Go with the crew. His heart rate, it's stable. He's got a bullet wound, too. Looks like he stitched it himself. Aren't you coming with us? I'll meet you there. All right, I'll go get you something to eat. Then I have to go home. I have to leave you here. All right, I'll... I'll be back soon. I'm so sorry about your friend. You know, we were best friends since we were six years old. It's not your fault. Who you were before this day doesn't matter. Blank slate. I have a really bad headache. All right, before I leave town... I- I'll get you some aspirin, too. I know you only paid for a blow job... but don't you want a little more? You didn't tell me you were making a movie. Anthony's gone. There's just a lot of blood. I swapped his mask glue with cyanoacrylate. It's the superest of all glues. Aah! A blank slate. Shh! You're gonna come with me, okay? - No! - Yeah. You're coming with me. We're gonna... ...go to the car, okay? - No! - No! No! - Shhh! Shut up! I swear to God, I will fucking slash you... if you make one sound, okay? You hear me? All right? I'm gonna take my hand away now... and you just be quiet, okay? All right? Be nice and quiet for me, okay? It's okay. There you go. Wow... I'm sorry it took so long. I got turned around on the way back. So I'm... I'm gonna take off now. I need to get home. So are you gonna be okay here? Do you have any money? Fuck! I don't even know where to start. Swab and clamp. Get as much tissue as you can from the mask. Swab. Hand it to me. - His heart rate is slowing. - I think he's dreaming. It looks like he's I N. Increase the morphine drip 5 cc's. Increase the irrigation. Touch it. Can I have the skin? Graft the stitches. Yes, it's coming into place now. Don't be afraid. Suture. Cross clamps. Responding well. Bring the healing mask. Here's Dr. Kerr. We did what we could. He's still not much to look at, but he'll live. Good. Money's been wired to your account in Switzerland. Stick around and make sure to monitor him. I'll take care of your accommodations and go over your needs. Thank you, Mr. Preston. - Spann? - Yes? Knock next time. So the victim checks in with the kid. The kid says he went out to get some food... gets back, she's like this. All right. Put the kid in my car. Sloppy. First timer. Somebody was in a hurry. Hey, King, I found this in the bathroom. It was in her jeans. - Any I. D.? - Negative. That's where the struggle was. - Is that the real thing? - Cha-ching. All right, Max. Take it to the lab. Do your thing, yeah? Who are you? Why do you have a $10,000 phone in a $50 motel room? How's your game? - Are you fucking kidding me? - Sorry, Sir. So I took care of all the business... on both... both of them, just like I always do. Hey, Boss. Are you in there? Can you hear me? I've got a present for you. I found her. I found the whore, and I killed her for you. Your knife was so sharp... it was way easier than I thought it would be. I had to. She was a loose end. L... I didn't know about the barn. And I didn't know about the old mortician... that you made the cash deal with. Let's keep it here. I can contain it all here. I've already... I've already cleaned everything up for you. Tell us why we're here. Jess, this is stupid. Stop it. Okay, I'm gonna film us on end till you tell us. We are here because we're worried about your eyes. Now, put that thing away. Oh, okay. Hi, what's this? Oh, Jess is documenting everything. I'm sorry, Doctor. Put that away so he can check your eyes. I have a good idea. Here, Mom. I don't know how to use it. Mom, just hold it steady. Fine. So have you noticed any change in your vision? Has it gotten worse in the last week? Yeah, a lot. Tell him about the halos, Jess. The halos, yeah. Any pain? Um, yeah. Okay. Uh, I don't think you want this on tape. I've never seen a patient with acanthamoeba... progress so quickly with all this additional scar tissue. It's really quite unusual. So am I going blind? Listen, I want you to stay calm... but I want to go ahead and schedule surgery for Monday... before any more scar tissue develops. - Okay. - All right? I'm gonna write a prescription for some medications. I think that'll help. All right? All right. So listen, I don't want you guys to panic. There's a lot we can do. And I'll see you Monday morning, all right? - Thank you, Doctor. - Okay, thanks. - Great. You left it on. - I'm sorry. No, now it's... - I'm sorry. - It's done. You don't need to hide. I'll help you. Jess's video diary, Wednesday. Uh, really excited for the concert tonight. Allie is gonna come over and do my makeup. These old eyes just ain't what they used to be, kids. Uh, um, well... there is a silver lining... and that is... drum roll. # Dah dah dah dah # # Doo doo doo doo # Legal medicinal marijuana, bitches. I'm really nervous about getting this surgery... but I don't want to go totally blind... so... You got to do what you got to do. Okay. Uh, I got to get to work. Peace. She's gone. And it was selfish of him... to rob you of that last kiss. But I'll leave you with a little something. There's plenty of fish in the sea. What? - He's anxious. - "He's anxious." What the hell does that mean? It means I have been instructed... to create a new play space. Why didn't he come to me? I'm not sure. It's the old chrome plating factory... that the shelter company owns. I'm having the crew set it up, all the fixings. You could take it from here if you like. I'll handle it. I fucking handle everything anyway. Have you seen him? He's fucking useless. He's toast. You know what? Let him have his last bit of fun... before he croaks. Please get the fuck out of my office. Now. I hate her. Great. You're high. I love this. Okay, one more for me. I'm getting super-duper high. Jess's video diary. What is this? I'm really excited about the concert tonight. It's my diary. Your diary? You talk to yourself on camera? I like talking to myself. Do you make YouTubes? I'm gonna make a YouTube of you right now. Oh, good. - You're so pretty. - You're making me nervous. Hey, you know, I'm gonna show this to your momma. Do it. I love you, Mom. What if one day I can't see all of these videos? Oh, God. That's bullshit. The operation's gonna work. You'll be fine. Yeah? Well... I'm just gonna memorize all of this... 'cause... It might not work. Okay, enough. I am not coming to your pity party. But I am gonna go make some popcorn. - Oh, yeah. - And you're gonna get dressed. Okay. And I think I'll drive tonight. - Oh, thank you. - All right, get dressed. - Woo! - Ooh, she likes it. Okay, I'll see you in a sec. Aah! Jess! Get the fuck out of this house or I will fucking kill you! Help! What the fuck is going on? The girl who lives here is missing. The mother's downstairs. She discovered the body. - And the father? - Dead. Cancer took him. - That definitely rules him out. - Yeah. Figured you might want this. I will take that. Run that footage as soon as you get back. I got a bad feeling about this, Max. I don't expect a ransom call. What if one day I can't see all of these videos? - Oh, God. - What? - That's bullshit. - Uhh! The operation's gonna work. You'll be fine. Yeah? Well... I'm just gonna memorize... ...all of this... - Stop. Go back. There. The kid with the girl in the motel. Yeah, the one who described the killer... wearing something just like that? I want him in here. Now. - Chasing the dragon again? - Fucking hell. Sorry. You still owe me for last month's rent. I know. Tommy, my parents aren't sending money anymore. I'm a student. I can't afford to cover your share. I know. Can you have it to me by Monday? Yes, all right, I'll have it to you. Shit. And stop smoking in the apartment. Oh, Christ. I knew that before he even opened his mouth. We're gonna get you, dude. We're gonna get you. Do you really think I should shave my head? - Uh... - And my eyebrows? Yeah, yeah. Won't that be kind of scary... like Uncle Fester scary? No. You don't gotta do it, but let me do it. Jesus. Sexy bitches are my favorite kind of bitches! Woo-oo! We survived it. Shit, clown... your biggest fear. Your biggest fear. - Aah! - Don't provoke him. Don't provoke him. You fuckin' creep me out. Jeez! Dude, you have no fucking idea where we're going. Jeez! Like it with your girl, huh? Jesus fucking Christ. Let's still change these. Okay, we'll keep her pinned. This part is a little creepy. I can't tell which one is real. Dude, it's too hard, and I can't see shit. Don't. No, don't. Laurie? Whoa. Hey, kid, take it easy. It's Max, from Homicide. My roommate, she didn't answer just now, and... That's okay. She probably just went out... for some food or something, all right? Listen, we need you to come down to the station. Why? L-l-already told you everything. We'd really appreciate it, okay? It?ll be all right. How far is your car? You know, I never even got her name. Yep. Ready in here. Bring the kid in. Okay, thanks. Take a look at this. Was this the mask you saw? You're sure? 'Cause a couple months ago when we brought you in... you told me this guy was dead... that the girl killed him. Well, dead guys don't just get up... and they sure as hell don't keep killing people. Help. Help. I can't... can't... Help! Help! Help! Please. Help! Cut it. Put it down. Do me a favor. Take, uh... take six of these... and strip the handle down... and then weld them... weld them together like a star. Like this, right? With the blades facing each other like scissors, all right? And then, um... put... put some springs in the middle here for tension, all right? - Got that? It make sense? - Oh, yeah, yeah, we got it. Go ahead. I'm a little depressed today. It was, um... too dark in my room even with the shades pulled... so I am retreating out into the sun. There it is. I like the sun. I have nothing. Oh, God. I'm trying to be, um... trying to see the light... at the end of the tunnel. No pun intended. I just feel like... it just keeps getting darker... and there's nothing I can do about it. You shouldn't be in here. Where am I supposed to be? Why don't you go get some coffee? Where are you going? Fuck this. He took out a police station? You never told me that. I'm not safe here. I'm not. Look, I know what this guy does, all right? And that girl doesn't have very long. Nobody's coming for you here. This isn't Ashville Canyon. We have a lot of cops with guns. Sit down. Could I at least have a cigarette? It's a no-smoking building. Knock yourself out. So I need for you to tell me some more about this mask. It doesn't have a strap. It's, um... some kind of glue. The Steven guy said it was glued on. But wait, you said it was metal. Well, it was really shiny, you know. - More like... like chrome. - Chrome? You sure? Yep. He even had a license plate... that had "chrome something" on it. Chromeskull. Yeah, we ran that plate. All the different spellings. It's a fake plate Nobody has that plate. So it's glued. So it must be lightweight. No, this is good. Hey, Holland. I need for you to check... every shop within 50 miles that does chrome plating. I'm on it. You okay? Guess I've finished my coffee now. Help! Help! Please! Sir, it, uh... it seems as though you've been moving forward... without informing us. Listen, you really... you need to keep us in the loop... all right? I- I really... I really don't want the same situation to happen... that happened the last time. - Excuse me, could you... - Oh, my God. Oh! - Aah! Oh, God! - Shut up. Come on, it's a little fucking piece of tape... and I swear to God, if you move, I'll kill you, all right? I'm having a conversation here. Listen, I can... I can do some of the legwork... for you, you know? All right, but did you realize that the girl wasn't alone... that there was a kid named Tommy that was with her? You know, I've been busting my ass... trying to track him down? Right now I'm feeling... I'm feeling really unappreciated. You realize that that kid can... he can lead them to you and to us and all of this? Damn it! You want to fucking go rogue and... and... and get your face fucked, fine. You know what? You're so lucky... that he's not here to taste you yet. You're really fucking tough. He's gonna do horrible shit to you. You know that? Horrible fucking things. Gross, gross fucking things. I mean, they make me sick. You know what I don't get? I don't get the fanfare and the fucking exhibition. You know what? I'm a fucking Band-Aid technique kind of guy. You want to know what he, uh... what he does to 'em, in the coffins? No, come here. All right. We got three factories in the vicinity. Owners are all clean, no priors. Closest one is about 20 miles from here, towards Miami. You just punched in. Go check it out. We can't get a warrant, so, by the book, yeah? You got it. Please. Help. Help! Help! Help! Someone! - It's Holland. - All right, thanks. - Hey, what you got? - I'm at the location. - It seems pretty abandoned. - Anything suspicious? Is the kid from the motel still with you? Ask him what the exact spelling of the license plate was. C- R-M-S-K... Hey, that license plate, one "L" or two "L"s? C- R-M-S-K-L-L. That didn't get us anything, you know? Yeah, I'm poking around. I'll let you know what I find out. Oh, God. Hello? Mommy? Jessica, my God, where are you? What do you mean? They took me... and they're gonna come and hurt me. Who wants to hurt you? Tell me where you are. I'll come and get you. I don't know. I don't know. Mommy, I have to go. No! No! Don't you hang up! Jessica, where are you? Mom, they're coming to get me. I just love you so much. Je... Je... Oh. I can't get to the phone right now... so leave a message, biatch. We're going to see your boss. By the book. Drop it! Uh... Aah! Aah! No! Aah! I want to talk to him now! A little help here, Max? My daughter called. My daughter's alive. Okay, Mrs. Cannon, I need you to calm down. - I'm not gonna calm down! - Did Jess say where she was? No, she was scared, and they drugged her. - Does she know who took her? - No, no! Did they ask for anything, money? She said once he was coming... - Okay, did they... - And there was a lot of noise... in the background. I want to talk to your boss. Okay, let's go to King. Come on. The girl's mom is here. She just called her. Yeah. Aah! No! Please! Why are you doing this? No, please! Please! Please don't do this! Please! Please stop! Sit! Max, check the phone records. See where the phone call came from. I'm gonna need your phone, Ma'am. - Will that work? - Hopefully. Max is the best we got. But she's my only child. She's everything. She's alone and scared. And... and she can't see very well. Jesus. Why? Why would somebody take her? It doesn't... it doesn't make any sense. It doesn't. Mrs. Cannon, I have a... I have a daughter. I can't pretend to understand what you're going through... but I will do everything I can to find Jess. I promise you, I will not sleep until Jess comes home. - I promise. - Thank you. - How you doing? - All right. Um, uh, sorry. Can I see you for a second, please? - Did it work? - We're working on it, Ma'am. Excuse me a moment. - The kid's gone. - He's what? I can't find him anywhere. - Did he run? - I don't think so. It looks like he could've been dragged out of here. Shit! Check in with Holland, see if she's got anything. If not, get her ass back here now. - We got to find that kid, Max. - Got it. Listen, Sir. Please let me go. I promise, no one will know except me. You're really pretty, you know that? I'm sorry you've had to just sit around and wait. He's usually pretty punctual. It's kind of his thing. I'm gonna let you breathe... for a little while, all right? I'm almost legally blind. I would never be able to identify you. What? I'm almost legally blind. I promise, I won't be able to identify you! Aah! Aah! Should I give you to him? No, no. Should I take you myself? I could use the practice. You know what? You're right. It's not the... it's not the mask that's intimidating. It's the man behind it. It's not the mask that's intimidating. It's the man behind it. You're making the right decision. He's mocking you now? He's the one who decides who lives or dies? Rest assured. This will all go smoothly. Who the hell is that? Homicide. Really? Hey, King? I can't get a hold of Holland. - Did she call in? - I checked with Dispatch. - Nothing since we last spoke. - How many people? Hey. Yeah, okay. Yeah, well, thanks. Kid's roommate? Found dead down in Cobb County. All sliced up. Fuck. So Holland was, uh, here. And Cobb is the opposite direction from us. - What, 40 miles? - Yeah. So we send everything up here. She has to find their phone. Needs charging. We don't have that kind of time. Well, I could head out there. If I see something, I won't make a move. I'll just call it in and keep an eye on things. Yeah, that's good. We send two detectives to Cobb County to check with the locals and the roommate... see if Tommy's there. I got a feeling that he's in the same place that Jess is. You two? Do the buddy-cop thing. This is gonna be over quick, all right? So one way or the other, one of us is gonna slice you. All right. Sss-sss-sss-sss. - Ahh! - Sit there. Box seat. You'll like that. Aah! Okay. Hey, boss, you, uh... You recognize this kid? He was, uh... he was with the girl in Ashville. It's another loose end. I fixed it, though. I, uh... that's what I do. I am a fixer. It's what you pay me for. Listen, I know he's not your type... so can I just kill him real quick? If that's all right with you? It's up to you. Uhh! Why don't you two run around the facility... a little bit... find something to hit me in the head with... or stab me with? Something fun. I'll be right back... and then I'll find you two. It's going right here. Shake them. Just go slow. Oh, God! Shit! Aah! You all right? You okay? All right, untie me. Listen, we really gotta hurry up. We got to find a safe place. I don't know why they want to kill me. I haven't done anything. Me neither, okay? I don't know about this guy but the one with the mask... he kills girls and videotapes it, all right? It's his thing. That's what this girl told me, and she's dead now. Aah! Shh! Shh, shh, shh, shh. Calm down. Wait. He had a mask on, too. Then he got her, or they did. I don't know. Listen to me. We have to focus, okay? Because he's right. This place is locked up, and we've got nothing. Not actually nothing. - What the fuck? - No, no. The signal, it makes these loud air horns go off. Give me a hand. I'm gonna move this. All right, all right. I'll go down first. No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. What if there's no way out from underneath? What? No. We could get trapped. If there's a signal down there... it might be able to shield the feedback from the thing, right? - Wait, wait. No. - Just shh, shh! Please, you have to calm down. Put this on and stay calm for me, okay? We're gonna get out of here. Shh. Wait here. Wait. Okay. You okay? Okay. Toss me down the phone. Hurry! It's working. Homicide. King. Yeah, it's me, Tommy. - I'm on the girl's phone. - It's the kid on two. What's your name? - Jess. - Jess. I'm on Jess's phone. He stuck something in my neck, so I don't know where we are. Okay, slow down. Who took you? Give me a description. Uh... tall, 6'1 ". Uh, dark, thick hair. It's definitely not the bald freak in the mask. Get here. Hurry, okay? Listen, I'm sorry, kid, but the, uh... we... we... we think the same... the same people got your roommate. What? Hello? Look, we're tracing the call. Just... just stay where you are. All right. They're tracing the call. We could hide down here. So can we... can we hide down there? They were looking for me. What? They're... they're tracing the call. - Come on. - Wait. What's going on? What are those? Pain pills. Why do you have those? All right. We're just looking for anything suspicious. Yeah, like Holland's car right there? Shit. All right. Hold on. I'm gonna call it in. Hey, it's Max. Tell the chief we see Holland's car, but no Holland. Yeah, use that as probable. Why don't you get the boys out here? Shit, Tiny. Hey, Max, Holland could be in some real shit. - We got to get inside there. - Or it could be nothing. I'm gonna go take a look inside. Ho, ho, ho, take it easy. All right, we walk the perimeter of the building, all right? But we do not go inside. You go that way. I'll go this way. - We meet in the middle. - Yeah. Hey, Tiny. You see anything? I'm already inside. North side of the building, there's a door... parking area. Shit. I know it might not look like it... but this is the safest place we can be. We just need to find something to keep that door shut... so look around. Wait, wait. What about, um...? This, if we use... The chain. Yes. Tiny? Which way did you go? Holy shit. Fuck. Tiny? Fuck off, Max. Max. I got a shitload of blood in here... and what looks like Holland's badge on the ground. Go call it in from the car. You copy? Tiny? Shit. They're coming. Okay, I know, I know, I know! That's not gonna stop him! Go. What do we do now? Try not to die. Fuck you! Stay back. They know where we are, motherfucker! - They're coming! - Oh, yeah? Well, you'll be dead by then. Oh, fuck you! Fuck you! I've done everything for you! Fuck you! That little fucking bitch can't do what I do! You can't fucking do what I do! Aah! Motherfucker! Aah! Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't, don't, don't. Don't, come on. Wait, wait, wait! This is a mistake, okay? You're making a mistake. Can we just talk about this, please? Please, can we talk about this, huh? Okay. Aah, hey. Hey, hey. I know you, right? I know you. I know you better than anybody else fuckin' knows you. Fuck. I fucked up, okay? I fucked up, all right?

It's okay, it's okay. I'll be there soon. Get the paramedics to check her leg. When did this become a Federal case? I can't discuss any details... about this investigation. We've been tracking him for quite some time. This location finally gave us a name and a face. You been watching us... knowing he was gonna spill more blood? He killed my whole fucking department. I'm afraid I can't discuss... ...any details... - You're welcome. We'll take over from here. I'll need your reports and your files. You can file the request with my replacement. We'll get you home to your mom. The full operation will be moved by next week. And might I commend you... on your new choice of scenery? I will take care of everything. We'll find the girl and resume with the plan. Until then... enjoy yourself. # Die # # Laid to rest # # Die # # Laid to rest # # Die # # Laid to rest # # Die # # Laid to rest # # Die # # Laid to rest # # Die # # Laid to rest # # Gonna die # # Laid to rest # # Gonna die # # Laid... to... rest ## Mrs. Cromeans, I know how difficult this must be. You don't know. We were gonna start a family. Everything was perfect. Men like this. They like to create an illusion. They need to maintain that cover. What goddamn cover?

He's not coming home. It's not your fault. He's made himself this way. He's a monster. Drop it! Drop the gun! Put the gun down! Put it down!
