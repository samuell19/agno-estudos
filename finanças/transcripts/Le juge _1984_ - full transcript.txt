The film The Judge is a work of fiction, for which the creators freely imagined situations and characters inspired by reality. It doesn't claim to perfectly recount the events that preceded the assassination of a magistrate at the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Marseille. PALERMO, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 10TH -Hello. -Hello, Your Honor. Can I get you anything? Yes, there's… There's no water. Water. -Water. There's no running water? -No. This bloody country. Thanks. -Is it armored? -Yes, of course. I'm always armed. I always have a pistol. Aren't you in Marseille? Yes. I protest, Your Honor. -Already? -I don't have to answer your questions. -I won't answer them. -I didn't say anything. Did I ask a question? I'm ill, you know? I won't be in this prison for long. No. Not for long. I didn't imagine you liked this. So how did you? With feathers on my head? With a mouth instead of a nose? How? I'm ill and you're taking advantage. Why did you come to Sicily, to Palermo, two months ago? As a tourist? As a tourist! I'm too old to be a tourist. No, I'm on essential business. You see, very few things are essential. No, you don't see. You have a dry mind, I saw it as soon as you came in. You're sick, sick to the core. -We're not from the same world. -What's your world? Gambling? Prostitution? Drugs? Drugs! What an abomination! -I'm a doctor, don't forget. -You left your office, you were disbarred. I'm a doctor, a pediatrician, a children's doctor. I look after children and you talk about drugs. Stop messing around, doctor! Who do you take me for? A doctor? You? You're an assassin. You filled Marseille with laboratories. You've come to do the same in Sicily. You're working with Mafia money. -With crime money. -I protest. -Sit down, I haven't finished. -Please. You will protest completely. For three years, you've been refining at least 150 kilos of heroin. Do you know what that means? That means millions of doses. That's hundreds of thousands of intoxicated people, families destroyed, existences wasted, young people dying, or even worse. You, a doctor? I'm going to charge you. You'll be judged in France, in Marseille and you'll get 20 years, I'll see to that. You can't prove anything, you have no evidence. Evidence? Evidence. Take this. Here is the evidence. Is that you in these photos? I'm talking to you. Yes, maybe, I don't know. And the guy next to you? -Who is that? -A client maybe. I looked after his children. He's very old, you know. He's a client. Louis Agopian. The best chemist in Marseille. He was convicted in 1971 and freed in 1976 on medical grounds. Agopian. With 95% pure heroin. The French Connection chemist. He taught you the job, you replaced him in Marseille whilst setting up Sicilian laboratories. I'm talking to you, doctor. I hear you, Your Honor. Who's pulling the strings? Who's paying? I asked you a question, doctor. Who's paying? Who is the drug boss in Marseille? I don't know what you're talking about. Rocca? Is it Antoine Rocca? You're going to talk, doctor. I guarantee that you'll talk. Hit me, hit me like the cop you are. -You'll see, if I talk… -Hey! -Take him. -You're a cop! You have a cop head, cop methods, you stink like a cop! I'll spit on you! -Go, stop. -You're a tiny little cop! What a mess, my friend. It's the same circle. As soon as Rocca was mentioned, he went crazy. You're taking some big risks. So are you. A lot more than I am. You know, a man who's in prison, a man who has… How do you say? -Handcuffs? -Yes, that's right. You have to respect him. I don't respect those people, with or without handcuffs. We have to stop them from poisoning and killing at all costs. That's what you're doing too, each to their own. Yes, I admire you a lot, you know. You're very brave. He's a cop! A real cop! Can you keep it secret for a few days? -A cop! -There are no secrets here. Everything you said is already known outside. MARSEILLE, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 15TH -The usual, Louis? -The usual. -Want me to connect the phone? -Yes, you're a good man. Give us three Ricards. How's it going, Mr. Louis? Slowly, I'm tired. Yeah, me too. It must be the weather, you know. Hello, this is Louis. -It's Rosa. -Hello, Rosa. -So, did you eat it? -No, we couldn't. We thought about doing it last night but we were tired, we couldn't. -Anyway, it doesn't matter. -Yes, I know. It's in the freezer, no bother. OK, I understand. -We'll call you as soon as we've eaten it. -Great, I'm here every day. -Goodbye, darling. -Bye, Louis. -Where did they go? -That way. Hey there, buddy! -We've been screwed. -No one saw them coming. …immediately, guys… And the photos. Commissioner, sir! Are you here? I was passing. Even working on a Sunday? I'm off tomorrow. I needed to get some things sorted. Are you in a mood with me, Your Honor? You should reinforce the surveillance around Agopian. That's what we're doing. -How many of you were there? -20, 25. Over 20 in any case. That's a lot of people. Can you protect someone against 25? Police work isn't an exact science. -Especially in Marseille. -Thanks, Your Honor. What's that? Agopian received a phone call a few minutes before getting shot. Well! It was a woman. She called from a phone box. Where? In Le Pyanet, an isolated area before l'Estaque. We verified all the homes, we got nothing. And the voice? One of our guys recognized it, but he can't remember who. A husky voice, with a bit of a cough, like someone who smokes a lot. I shouldn't have gone to Sicily. The doctor got me. He didn't give up and made me reveal myself. That's the game. They shot Agopian as soon as they knew he'd been spotted. It could be that, or something else. We tie up three poor junkies, two drug addicts on the run, and meanwhile the real big shots are calm. You have to hit the head… The head. The head. You have some good ones. Bring me Rocca, to this office. I'll tie him to a chair for as lost as it takes and you will see if I can't get him. So is that it? You're on vacation? Yes, two weeks. No luxury. -Are you going home? -Yes. The Vosges are lovely, the mountains and everything. But you're leaving at the wrong time. It's going to move, I'm sure. OK, my friend, you'll be here. -Goodbye. -Won't you miss my cop face? It seems I have one too. No… there might be something. -Not the essentials. -What's essential? That's what makes you a judge and me a cop. You're so handsome! We prepared the luggage and the picnic. -I can see. -With boiled eggs too. -No way! Are you going to eat them? -Yes. I thought you didn't like them. How are your glasses? Let me see. You can't see anything anymore. I can see you. -Go get my helmet. -OK. I can't believe we're all going together. See, you just needed to trust me. Look! -No documents, no files. -You have it in your head, I'm suspicious. Good evening, ma'am. Evening, Mr. Rocca. Good evening. Are you OK? Yes, I am. Who were you talking to at the restaurant? I talked to a lot of people. You know, the American. He's Canadian. We're going to work together. I don't like him. You will. He's coming to the house. Where are you going? Go on, I'll explain. Please step out of the car. The switchblade has been removed, there's a bullet in the barrel. Do you agree? You are under arrest. Do your job, I'll explain to the judge. Please follow me. -Hello? -It's Innocenti. One moment. It's one of those guys again. Don't worry, go to sleep. Sleep. What time is it? No idea. You know the best part? -The best part? -They arrested Rocca. They arrested Rocca? Who's they? Why? I don't have the details, something about possessing a firearm. He had a bazooka in his car. -A bazooka? -It's a big thing, you'll see. How will I see? What will I see? You're not going to miss this? Rocca done in in your office. Listen, I'm on vacation. I'll leave soon. I would have thought so. -Thanks for letting me know. -Are you sure? I have a long road ahead. OK? Bye. François! -How are you? -What are you doing here? I'm staying actually. You'll do something stupid again! -That's not impossible. -Bye. Bye. TRAINING -Coffee, please. -Aren't you on vacation? Yes, why? Don't I look like I'm on vacation? Yes, now that you mention it. A beer! I knew you'd stay. You can't miss an opportunity like this! It's a rubbish vacation, but it's a vacation. I feel like we're going to have fun, I'm fit. You'd better not cover your tracks, I warn you. I won't let anything happen to you. What's wrong with him? So, you're not answering? You're justifying possessing this weapon for self-defense following an assassination attempt that you were a victim of in March 1979. You felt threatened. You were uneasy. Hence the revolver, right? Sorry, I didn't hear your response. I must point out to you, Your Honor, that in this matter Mr. Rocca was the victim. -Right? -No one doubts that. Yes, but these things must be clear. They are. So, I'd suggest that my client not respond to questions that don't concern the facts he is accused of. Let's save time. Mr. Camoin is right, the case has been closed for three years. We won't spend the afternoon going over it. I am willing to speak out on anything you want. But that… There's no question. I understand my client's point of view and I approve it. Please, sir, let Mr. Rocca talk. Go ahead, Rocca, talk. -What about, Your Honor? -Rocca… You're mocking me. You have just offered to speak. Speak! I'm listening. Do you want me to help you? Very well. So where do we start? Huh? Drugs? That's good, it's a subject that I love. Look! Look at the cabinet! Do you see the files? Drugs, drugs, drugs! Rocca, Rocca! So go ahead, my friend. Speak. It will be a relief. -Your Honor… -Leave it. Your Honor, I don't allow anyone… Anyone, you hear, to talk to me like that. You're on one side of the desk, and I'm on the other. You're the judge, and I'm going back to prison. It doesn't mean we shouldn't respect each other. I respect you, so show me respect. You're dreaming, Rocca. You're completely delirious. Show you respect? You? On what grounds? Drug trafficking? Pimping? I can respect you, but give me good reasons. Watch what you're saying. Mr. Rocca, Your Honor! Go ahead, wreck the office, trash the place. Express yourself fully! I will bring you to your knees, Rocca. You're going to spit it all out, from start to end, and I'll get you. Here, sign this. Guard, you can take your prisoner. You can work on your files! That was the trial run, next time it will be the real deal. Your Honor. Air! How was it, Grégoire? The attack was a bit late. He had time to prepare. You think? I actually think I got him at the right time. We all fell asleep and snap! Mr. Muller, I have no intention of influencing the order, but you know, as court president, we have certain responsibilities. -I know, President. -Look. This letter is addressed to the Minister of Justice. And a copy was sent to me by Mr. Camoin. Read it. Read it! You understand that it's very serious. If we believe Mr. Rocca, you called him a drug dealer, a pimp, what else do I know? Doesn't a judge have the right to call him what the press has been writing for years? We're not the press. We're… you understand! The press, yes. It's different for us. Do you understand this letter? Minister of Justice! Your methods… Of course, the results are there. There's no doubt. -What do you want from me? -A denial. A categorical denial. A written denial. And I'd add… A more flexible attitude, more… -More flexible? -Yes, more… Well! Yes, hello? Death to the judge. Death! Death to the judge! Death! Hello, mom? Is that you? Your wife just called you. Can you put her on? No, she's gone, she was running late. Gone? Where? To the Freds, you know the Freds! Oh, yes. And the little one? He's sleeping, of course. Hello, are you there? Yes, I'm here. Are you coming for Christmas Eve? We expect to see you. Of course I am. Was there anything in particular? In particular? No, nothing. -Sending kisses, Mom. -Sending kisses too, goodbye. It's François! -Hi, François. -Hello. -Shall we hang out? -No, just a drink. -Come with us, don't stay alone. -No, thanks. François, have you seen Marie Claude? Marie Claude? Yes, two or three times. Careful! We know each other, don't we? Donati, I'm a lawyer. I remember, yes. Ingrid, this is Judge Muller, he's a tough guy. Ingrid is a great friend, she's Swedish. Well, Your Honor, we'll be seeing each other often. -Oh, really? -You don't know yet. Mr. Rocca has asked me to defend him. And I accepted, naturally. I already met with Mr. Camoin. Mr. Camoin is a tired old flame, we need new blood. Well, there you go. I'll come by in the morning to look at the files. Are you tired? Do you want to go? She's tired, we're going. I'll get it. -No, please, let me. -Very well, good evening! How much do I owe you? Not bad, right? Nice little toy. Want to see? It'll bring back memories. Press the top. Not bad! I have all the documents. With all the options. Automatic standby, air conditioning, cabinet-deck stereo system, you have it for… 85 million before tax. Are you talking in francs? -850,000 francs. -850,000 francs. From the moment you bought your boat, you were the manager of the company Sud-export, with a monthly salary of 7,300 francs. You can't go far with that. I had inheritance, an uncle, my mother's brother. Who left you a 150,000-meter-squared house. A kitchen, two bedrooms upstairs, a family room, no bathroom. Located at Saint Barnabé, 8, montée de l'Olivier. Yes, a small house. That you sold a few months later to Roger Zarifian. I don't remember, yes. For a sum of…? -Do you remember? -I don't know. -It wasn't a big deal. -What do you need? 90 million. 900,000 francs. 900,000 francs. Between us, it wasn't worth that. You ripped him off a bit. In real estate, people buy anything at any price. Of course. Write that down, Miss. Mr. Rocca recognizes that he sold a property to Mr. Zarifian Roger at an inflated price. My client didn't say that, it cannot be included in the minutes. Very well, what do you propose? My client made a general comment about the deterioration of real estate. Cross it out, Miss. General considerations do not concern us. What's that? Another photo. These files are really well done. Look what I've found. Oran, 1959. That's funny, I was there in 1960. We were almost regimental buddies. Well. The guy next to you is Zarifian. Zarifian Roger. He has a bar now, in place de Tignes. Nice bar! A brewery. I don't understand why he bought this house in Saint Barnabé from you with no bathroom for 90 million. What do you think? It's interesting, isn't it? -You know, it's… -Of course. And friends have to be useful for something. Come in. Excuse me, Your Honor, I just wanted to change the bulb, I'll come back. Go ahead. We've been waiting for that bulb for ages. And voilà, it works. -Goodbye, Your Honor. -Thanks, Martin. Zarifian Roger, Roger Zarifian. It seems to me there's something else. Code 312. Real estate company. Boulevard des Fleurs. Where did it go? Ah, here it is. Deed of Incorporation. A property at 22 boulevard des Fleurs, Marseille, 7th arrondissement, are appointed: administrator, Mr. Zarifian Roger, and Ms. Flora Dos San… Ms. Flora Dos Santos, married name Rocca, right? -Yes, that's my wife. -It's not specified. Ms. Flora Dos Santos, married name Rocca. So this property belongs to you. We're married under the separate property regime. Understood. Besides, you'd see the building, Le Pyanet! Le Pyanet? Boulevard des Fleurs is the official name, the neighborhood is called Le Pyanet. That's interesting. Write "Le Pyanet," Miss. There is no need for this, the investigation is null, you let an external person come in. -You dare to do that? -Your Honor, there are laws, there are rules, I didn't make the law. Mr. Rocca, please sign these minutes. Very well, sir. You want to play that game? We'll both have a good laugh. Guard, you can take the prisoner. No hard feelings, Your Honor. Goodbye. Right. We're not going to let it get us down, Grégoire. I think we have something. Le Pyanet rings a bell. Yes, for me too. I was going to say. We saw this happen not long ago. Innocenti spoke to me about it, but… About what? Le Pyanet! I had an uncle who lived there. Your uncle didn't lead us down a path. I remember, we took the train from l'Estaque on the Sunday. Wait! L'Estaque… The woman who called Agopian before he was shot called from a phone box in Le Pyanet. Innocenti told me that it was an isolated neighborhood before l'Estaque. Give me the listening report. We're going to do the cops' job. DES FLEURS RESIDENCE Grégoire? Call Innocenti. I'd like to have dinner, when and where he wants. There you are, sirs. It's on me. No, we'll split it. Old principles, eh? Yes, principles. -So. -Good, very good. Good. -That isn't…? -Yes! Great, isn't it? 15 years in the slammer, fresh as a daisy. -Nice face of a crook. -The old guard. Great lord! Your restaurant is very popular. I think so! Turn around, at the back! Your boss! Waiter? -What's he doing here? -Having dinner. We all have to eat. Look. Pétris, one of the kings of Marseille. He controls the weather. If you need a building permit for… And does this world get on well? Of course, as they say in Marseille, "By day we argue, by night we talk." I've never heard that proverb. Of course, I just made it up. Small cop space. Does it surprise you? Yes. I actually wanted to say that… Well, you're right. It's not mine. It's a girl's. She did all this. Because you know, I… I prefer curtains at the windows. And I don't like sleeping on the ground. -What about the girl? -She's gone. And is that the girl? No! That's… That's me. Do you play? -Well? -I'm not bad. Cognac? One finger, yeah. About… Do you remember that woman who called Agopian on December 13th? The fat girl with the cough? Why fat? Because she sounded fat, didn't she? You told me about a public phone box. Yes, Boulevard des Fleurs, in Le Pyanet. That's where we located her. I saw the phone box earlier. It's 50 meters from a property belonging to Antoine Rocca. 22 Boulevard des Fleurs. Only you do these things. Sorry? Nothing. -Bye, see you tomorrow. -Bye. I don't have a lot of time. -So? -He won't talk to anyone. -He's alone in a cell. -Damn. It's a cell for four, the other spaces are free. As if by chance. There was an incident during the walk, someone was messing with him. Two guys intervened to defend him, he didn't have to do anything! -Who? -Sivant and Massioni. -What, Massioni's son? -Yes, the son. -And what else? -They were talking about a fund transfer. -How much? -A lot. Is Rocca paying or receiving it? He's paying. -Great… Is that all? -That's all for now. It's a big one, Your Honor. Very big. I'm used to it. It's the real thing. I know, yes. In order to catch him… Mr. Rocca, I'd like to resume your income review. Officially, you have a salary from the company Sud-export. I protest. I protest, my client has already answered these questions. He is tired, he has been unable to sleep for several nights. You're abusing your power. It's mental torture, we've gone back to the Middle Ages. Mr. Donati, would you like your remarks recorded in the minutes? Clearly not. Are you retracting your remarks? Yes, and I suggest my client not to answer these questions that have already been asked and he has explained. Leave it, sir. If the judge wants to interrogate me I can answer his questions. Go ahead, Your Honor. Talk to me about your wife's assets. I already explained everything. I didn't understand properly, please start again. Your Honor, I appeal to your heart. Mrs. Rocca is pregnant and will give birth in a few weeks. Mr. Rocca is very affected by being away from her. I understand. In this regard, I have the intention of calling in Mrs. Rocca next. -Don't you find that inconvenient? -Don't ask my opinion. You'll take responsibility for your decisions. Thanks for reminding me, sir. What's this? You can't stay there! -Hey! -Shut up! Sorry, Lucien. Régine Sauvat. Who is that? The fat coughing woman. Why? Is she really fat? Thanks. Régine Sauvat moved there in 1956. The property belonged to Bonelli, she was his mistress at the time. Do you remember Bonelli? -The cigarettes? -Yes, the cigarettes. And then some drugs, that was more discreet. He only got caught once, in 1964. And again, it wasn't very clear. He got a generalized dismissal. Bonelli sold the property in 1970, he and Régine were no longer together. And Rocca bought it. Rocca and a certain Zarifian. Yes, I know him. And what became of Bonelli? He has a bar. Chez Lucien, Place de l'Opéra. What does she do at the post office every five minutes? Making a call. We wanted to bug the cabin, but there was no way, it's still busted. The kids did it. Hello, could I speak with Mr. Claude, please? He's not there today. OK, I'll call back. She's never gone for more than an hour or two. -Look… -What? An hour is enough for a short visit. That's your cop stuff. Don't try and get me involved, I have enough to deal with. -Is it working? -Do you think it's easy? That's it. There's nothing, it's empty. MS. SAUVAT RÉGINE MARSEILLE PASSENGER TICKET NAME: MS. SAUVAT RÉGINE CARGO SHIP FROM GENOA TO MARSEILLE BOARDING DECEMBER 12TH I can't see this, I can't stand it. Ten kilos of heroin that went under our noses. I've never seen that. Never! This is bad, very bad. You're going a bit fast, Perrota. We're not sure what's in this car. Believe me, I'm often right. You know my opinion, better to hold than to run! I'll up the first to arrive, along with the car. That's always a plus. You do it your way! Did you see? I gave you all the regional police. Today it's you, the drug squad, who's in charge. -You should be happy. -Thanks, Mr. Perrota. What the hell is she doing? Vincent Abecassis! Damn! Look who's back! Abecassis! We've been looking for him for two years, and here he is. Kids, I smell a big one! Hello. This is the authority. Alert all the cars. I confirm. Yellow Ford Escort. Registration 34 50 SU, Sierra Uniform, 83. The vehicle is being driven by Sauvat Régine. About one meter 60, brown hair, looks about 40. She is accompanied by Abecassis Vincent, one meter 80, 25 years old. Dark brown hair. Wearing a black leather jacket and a blue shirt. Be careful, this individual is usually armed. Number three, confirm takeover. Over. Number three, I'm in contact, over. Understood, number three, follow them. Hello, Joliette, this is number three. The vehicle will get to you in 15 seconds. Understood, number three, we're waiting. OK, Joliette, safe trip. Number eight, place Saint Just, at metro level. Do it fast because I have a big gap. Yes. -Judge Muller? -Ah, you're letting me down. I'm like a single mother here. I had Perrota on my back all morning, this is not a present. OK. Where are you? We're following her. -Does she suspect anything? -I don't think so. Just routine. Call me back. As soon as I have news. For your children and for breakfast don't forget our hot croissants fresh from the oven. And on the patisserie shelf you'll find our king cakes, our delicious king cakes… Hello, Castagnolle? Castagnolle, over. We've changed clients. He's alone, tall… Perronis, can you see me arriving? Yes, I see you. OK, we'll get him. -Bye. -See you. Authority, this is ten, we have contact. Le Lavandou… It's good. Position number four. Number four. Number five? Number five, Saint Just, over. Number six? Number six, I'm just coming… Hello, authority? Authority on ten. They're screwing with us. St André exit. We can't follow. No firecrackers, I have someone there. St André, that'll be you. OK, I see it. We're on it. Go slowly, he won't go far, it's a dead end. Hello, dead end. Can I smoke? Of course. Tell me about Louis Agopian. I don't know who that is. You called him at the Bar des Amis, just before he was shot. Tell me about the Ford. Who gave you the ticket? Why did you go get it? I had to do it. I don't have to tell you why. You have to answer my questions. I'm going to charge you. You're going to be incarcerated. I don't care about prison. It's no big deal. In any case, it's no big deal. Don't tire yourself out, Your Honor. I won't say anything. Hello? Yes, please hold. It's for you, Your Honor. It's Palermo, Judge Galeazzi. Hello? Yes? Very well, and you? When? That's no surprise. No, I'll call you back. The doctor took off. Last night. The usual. We'll wait for him here. Do you know the guy they call the doctor? A former pediatrician. Do you know Antoine Rocca? If I knew him, would I tell you? Rotten Muller! I don't want to see him! Mr. Abecassis, calm down, please. Calm down. No, I won't go and see him! Not that crook! Did I hear my name? No, I don't want to see him! Dirty crook! -Bring me the device. -He doesn't want it! Do you want me to handle this myself? Stay in the office, sometimes this lunatic wants to jump on me. Put a shirt on, if it's not too much trouble. You've been tricked, haven't you? Foolishly. It's not that, Your Honor. I do a lot of stupid things. A lot of stupid things. I can help you a bit, but… You have to help me too. But I've told you everything. No, not that, not here. Or I'll let you go. This is mutually beneficial, man to man. No one is listening to us. We can say anything. Do you know anything about Rocca? Your Honor, you can't ask me that, not about Rocca. It's too big for me. OK, well then… something else. -Your Honor… -What, Your Honor? I don't care. If you don't want it, you don't. Only I'll work on your file, trust me. I had two meetings, both in the same place. Go on. Bar Lucien, place de l'Opéra. OK, there you go. That's something. It's not big, but it's something. You know, I'm not an informant. No, of course not. Who told you about that? Your Honor. I didn't make an appointment, but I thought it was serious enough to… Since you're here, come in. Can I? Well. I came to warn you, Mr. Rocca is very ill. I need to ask that he be released on medical grounds. Ill? What's wrong with poor Rocca? Cancer. Cancer. You're going a bit far. It's not like getting a cold. He had treatment five years ago, 25 radiotherapy sessions. Yes, but he was released. I have the medical certificates. Want to see them? -It's a very rare relapse… -Relapse? You choose your words well. Listen, let's not beat around the bush. I'm keeping Rocca, not releasing him. Not when I'm starting to score points. -This is relentless! -Correct. I am determined to demonstrate that Mr. Rocca is trafficking drugs. And not just any old one. Relentless. -This is like a novel. -Perhaps it is like a novel. As you know, I'll do what it takes, you take the lead and come to tell me about your client's cancer. You have no respect, there's no way to talk to you. No, no way! With me, it's war. War! War until the end. Fine, if you take that tone, so will I. You're playing the big shot. I warn you, we won't let you do it. -Are you threatening me? -Yes, I'm threatening you. Note, Miss clerk, Mr. Donati is threatening Judge Muller. Damn, she's not there. Shame for you. Get out! I'm going. Do you know why you're going to lose? You're alone. You are a fool, OK, but you're alone. You should never be alone in life. So? You're the talk of the prison. -What are they saying? -You're a torturer, in the Gestapo. You're slowly killing Rocca. There's a petition going round. And all that randomly? You know how it is! Things go quickly in prison. You just repeat the same bullshit three times, it spreads then suddenly it blows up. I'm not going to die, I'm used to it. It's all bla-bla-bla, just chit chat. You should be careful this time. They say there's a bounty on your head. What do you want me to do? If they really want to shoot me, they will, so… Might as well carry on. KISSES FOR DEAR DADDY PASCAL "Street of Silence", 1927. I like it. I have loads of old records. I haven't listened to them for ten years. Ah, not bad. Charlie Christian, very good. Cliffer Brand. I bought them when I was a student. -Do you want a beer? -I'd love one. Abecassis spoke to me. Just like that? No, he had several appointments at Chez Lucien, place de l'Opéra. -Bonelli's place. -Yes, Bonelli. Régine Sauvat's former lover. Formerly charged in a drug thing in 1964. Former business associate of Antoine Rocca. We're getting there, bit by bit. So, Rocca is under the weather. You're already up to speed. Cancer, it's going strong! Donati might be getting him released. And if Rocca gets out of prison, we'll never see him again. And Régine Sauvat? Silent. You get the impression that… nothing can touch her. We can try. But your protégé is likely to suffer. Protégé? What protégé? Abecassis! You should've promised him something for the tip he gave you! I don't do business with people like that. Let me do it then. You have three days. I'm going to the Vosges for Christmas. Ah, the Vosges are very nice. The mountains! Sometimes, with you, I wish I were from Brittany. -Tarzan! -Lucien! -You're up early. -Are you OK? As always. I'm bored stiff. You have a nice office though. Yes, but I'm bored. Well, you should've stayed with me. Tell me, did you know Bonelli? Seriously? I was the one who tied him up in 1964. Ah, I couldn't remember. We're on to something big with him. He's in it up to his neck. -The heroin? -No, sardines in oil. I was sure he'd pick it back up one day. Abecassis has tipped us off. I know him too, he's mad. A good guy, mind you. -Don't say anything! -You know me. Too right. CENTRAL SECURITY COMMISSARIAT -Oh! -Hi, Lucien. Hello. -Are you coming by? -It's not too early. They're having a laugh. We're having a good laugh with one of your buddies. Abecassis. You can keep him! He's a gullible fool. But he's not a difficult guy. You nudge him and he tells his life story. -He spat Bonelli out like that! -I thought he had hung up? -You see? -Oh, shit. -Keep that to yourself. -Of course. What is it? Ah, Pinacchio! I thought you were asleep. Think about it, I'm working! -Why are you laughing? -Because I'm happy. So just like that, you want to cause trouble for Bonelli? -Who told you that? -Tarzan. He said, "Lucien wants to cause trouble for Bonelli". I know Bonelli well. -We're from the same village. -Oh, yeah? From time to time, I go by place de l'Opéra. I owe him 200 francs. Hurry up and pay him back. -Did you want to see me, son? -No, I was just passing by. I have to go. By the way, be careful with Bonelli. See what I mean? You can count on me. DE L'OPÉRA BAR Mr. Bonelli? Yes, that's me. Nobody move! I was looking for you. You were quick. I got the first train. What happened? Two young guys came into the bar. They shot him in the heart and left, it was over in 20 seconds. Can you give me a cigarette? I wasn't going to smoke again, it's stupid. Who did it? Do you have an idea? Rocca. He knew that we snitched on his associate, he didn't want to risk it. How could Rocca have known? Abecassis spoke to me, you're the only one I told. I couldn't hold my tongue. Why? What for? With what right? Look, you have to know. You asked for Rocca, I got you Rocca. You have to go to the end, it's too late to chicken out. Chicken out? I don't understand. Donati is surely going to free Rocca. Rocca knows everyone, he has money, he can pay. And cancer, true or not, commands respect. That leaves us a week, two maximum. OK, but… You don't have evidence against him, no witnesses. -Actually, there's Bonelli. -Ah, Bonelli! He would never have spoken, we'd have had to start all over again. Checking, tracking. Chain and watch. A real investigation! Months of work! But you wanted to take the hard line. I don't understand, what's your plan? I don't have a plan. I hit at random. I shake the tree and see what falls off. A man was killed. OK, that was the last of the rotten ones. In the end, I don't know… We don't owe Abecassis anything. Rocca didn't hesitate to kill Bonelli, what about Abecassis? Or yourself? I couldn't predict it. You're responsible for Abecassis. I protect my markers. They give me something, I give them something. I don't negotiate with them. So what do you care about what happens to Abecassis? I feel like I've let the dogs out and they are running after me. Yes, I know. But you'll see, you get used to it. You need to encourage him to eat. And force him if need be. Your Honor, his lack of appetite is a consequence of his illness. We can't do anything about it nor can he. Can't you imagine that he's trying to deliberately get weaker? Unfortunately, his illness is not a matter of hypothesis. It's undeniably shown in the clinical exams. We'll see. I've requested he be transferred to the hospital in Fresnes. I'd like to proceed with new examinations. I hope you don't get the transfer, Your Honor. It would be incompatible with Rocca's state of health. And the equipment at Fresnes is the same that we have here. The equipment, not the doctors. Want to clarify? Do you think that's really necessary? It's me, I need to talk to you. I just came once, I don't remember it well. It was nighttime. Do you want something to drink? I came to tell you… Bonelli's assassination has caused an uproar at the prison. That woman, Régine Sauvat, almost went mad. You know, her and Bonelli… Yes, I know. They had to isolate Abecassis. The guys wanted to butcher him. Bonelli was an old-timer. Everyone knew him. You said Régine Sauvat. You should talk to her. She's ready for anything. Innocenti was right. -Régine Sauvat. -In this cell. You're here? I thought you'd prefer to talk to me here. Without anyone listening. Yes, perhaps. I don't know anymore. It was Rocca who had Bonelli killed. Bonelli worked for Rocca. Abecassis talked and Rocca wouldn't take the risk. Is that right? That's right. He's the only clean man I met, Your Honor. The only one. I know that you can't understand that. For you, Bonelli was a crook, but… I understand. Would you accept giving a statement against Rocca? What do you know about him? Nothing. As much as you. I know it's all in his hands, but I don't have any proof. Did you ever meet him? Just as anyone might meet him in Marseille. We had dinner two or three times with Bonelli, when I lived with him. One day I saw him on rue St Ferréol with his wife. He stopped to say hello, that's all. Nothing else? Are you sure? Nothing. If I knew, I'd say so. Anything else? Please. You can help me. I don't owe you anything. And you owe nothing to those who killed Bonelli. They killed Bonelli, Régine. They killed him like a dog. I know. I know. No, it won't come out. I can't do it. Tell me what happened to the car. You can do that. At the very least. So? Both of you go. OK, boss. Five minutes and we'll go. Take that, you'll have a front-row seat. Get to work! Captain! -Put the device in place. -Yes. In position. What's it for? It's for the water, sir. It's the water company. -Water? -Yes. Come on, get up! Coffee is served. When are your colleagues showing up? -8, 8:30, it depends on the day. -We'll wait for them. Great, I'll let the boss know. I'll go round the back. It's me. We don't make fun of clients in Marseille! Oh, Pierrot, you made us coffee. No coffee, this morning. We're taking you guys in. Who are we waiting for to start? We haven't done anything, we don't know what goes on in this shack. We came for repairs. You chose the wrong day! Don't shoot! Muller! Muller! Muller! Blessed be the one who in their life had the chance to have a remarkable destiny. And all of us, his loved ones, his colleagues, his friends will take care of Lucien Innocenti the memory of a remarkable man, in the most noble sense of the word. Yes, Lucien Innocenti knew how to persist, with the force that gives courage, honesty and a sense of duty. Lucien Innocenti, emotion grips me when I mention the figure… Your Honor, we didn't want to. I understand, of course, I understand. It's terrible. …in defiance of his fatigue… -Did you know him? -Innocenti? You'd think! Did you get the letter? -What letter? -About Mr. Rocca. His release on medical grounds. As we said, in his condition… You'll see, you'll get it soon. Excuse me. …anger grips us and we cry out for vengeance! Vengeance for the innocent victim! Vengeance for this colleague who was killed in cold blood. Subtitle translation by: Chloe Stout
