- Hello? Hello? - Is this Anthony Peterson? - Who is this? - Is this Anthony Peterson? - Who the fuck is this? - Is this Anthony Peterson? - Yes, this is Anthony Peterson. Who the hell are you? - This is Mrs. Anthony Peterson. - Anthony, you've gotta help me. They've got me tied to a chair and blindfolded. - Oh, Susan, no, Susan. - I don't know where I am, they won't tell me who they are. I'm scared. - You give us what we want or we take turns gang-fucking her and we post it on the web, and then we kill her. It'll be the world's first live snuff film. - No, no, don't hurt her, please, don't hurt her. - Then give us what we want. - Where am I? - You've been kidnapped, Mr. Peterson, trapped. What's the last thing you remember? - Uh, I was on the street and then, uh, I was smothered, and I woke up here. - We drugged you, pulled you off the street, something that happens in human trafficking circles 100 times a day around the world. - Where am I? - Maybe you're in Siberia, maybe the Middle East, maybe you're in New York, maybe you're just down the street from your home. - Are you just outside this container? - Maybe we're 100 miles away, maybe we're next door. The thing is, you'll never know. - Well, what do you want? - $10 million. - I do not have that kind of money. - We both know that you do. - Wait a minute, is this something personal? Do I know you? - Shut up. If you contact the police, your wife dies, then you die. If you contact the FBI, your wife dies, then you die. If you contact any authorities, your wife dies, then you die. You've got air for 24 hours, that should be more than enough time to get the money together. - No, no, 24 hours is not enough time, I need more time. - Once you have the money, we'll send you the account to wire it to. You do as we say, we'll let you go and your wife go. If you deviate from the plan one iota, you're both dead. We'll rape and murder your wife and broadcast it online, and then we'll leave you to die alone slowly of suffocation. Chances are, your body will never be found. - Please, don't do this, please, I'm begging you. - You've got some calls to make. - Help me! Help, help me, please, please! Help me! Get me outta here, please! Help! Help! Help! Get me outta this place! I need help! Help! Help! Damn it! - Hello? - Tom! Tom, it's Anthony. - Anthony? God, it's two o'clock in the morning. - Just listen to me! I have been kidnapped. - Kidnapped? What, is this a joke? - No, no, they got Susan too, and they're gonna kill her if I don't give 'em what they want. - Who? - I don't know who, somebody, I don't know. - Where are you? - I am in a metal cargo container, somewhere, and I don't know where. It could be anywhere. - Well, man, call the police. - If I call the police, they are going to kill her. They could be listening to this conversation right now. - What do they want? - $10 million. - What? - Yeah, look, just, just sell everything. - Everything? - Everything, my shares, my portfolio, and when you get the money together, call me back, and they're gonna give me the account to wire it to. - You're serious about all this, aren't you? Anthony, you sure this is really how you wanna roll with this? - I don't know, I don't know what I am doing right now. I just, oh, I just want my baby, Susan, back. - I'll get back to you. - Mr. Peterson? - Yeah, yeah, my closest associate is getting the money. I just spoke to him, he's getting the money together now. - For both your sakes, I hope so. - Yeah, look, just tell me something, please, why are you doing this? I mean, why me? - Why not you? - Look, I'd understand about the money, I mean, but, I'm just an honest businessman. I'm a good man, I pay my taxes, I don't understand why you're doing this. - You don't get to where you're at by being good, Mr. Peterson. - Listen, I'm not perfect but I do not deserve this. - You honestly believe you're a good man? - Yes, yes, I do! - What about September 25th? - What about September 25th? - September 25th, 10 years ago. - Uh, I don't know what you're talking about. - September 25th, 10 years ago, South America, a business deal of yours went sour. The people you needed to sell to you reneged on the deal, they had a crisis of conscious. You stood to be out millions, so you had them killed, everyone. - I don't know what you're talking about, it's a lie, it's an absolute lie. - You hired mercenaries. - No, now that is an absolute fabrication. - Entire families, you had wiped out. - That's a lie! - You paid them extra to make an example of all of them. - Lie, lie! - You had them decapitated and their heads stuck on pikes - What? - and planted on the outskirts of the city. - Liar! - You bathed the streets with their blood. You killed the children last and made them watch their parents being murdered. You were sending a message, and it was loud and clear, "Don't fuck with Anthony Peterson." You had the money and influence to keep it out of the press, paid off all the right people, judges, cops, politicians, and it was all swept right under the rug. - Liar. - But everybody knew. - Liar. - Murderer. - Tom, Tom, is everything a go? - Yes, and no. - What, why? What do you mean? - We're a ways short of the 10 million. - Well, how short? - Four, maybe five. - What, are you kidding me? - Hey, man, you're mortgaged to the hilt. You gotta let me call the long arm of the law, man, you can't just go lay down and go all bitch dog for these sons-of-bitches. - No, if we call them, she dies, Susan is dead. - Well, would that be so bad? - What the fuck, man? Are you kidding me? - Hey, you were the one always saying that she was a stone-cold-ass bitch, that the magic was gone, the only reason you kept the marriage going is that it was cheaper to keep her. - I was drunk, give me a break. - In vino veritas, my friend. How do you know this all isn't a con? Who knows who's in on it? Susan, maybe. - No, she would not do that, I know that. - Well, then, I... I don't know what to tell you, my friend. - Hold on, hold on. Yeah, this is Anthony Peterson. - The money? - Yeah, well, I got most of it, I mean, most of it. - Not good enough. - Well, I cannot come up with $10 million, that is crazy! - If you can't come up with the money, take it out of your rainy day fund. - Rainy day fund, what are you talking about? - A man like you has got to have a lot of cash on hand. Bent lawyers and judges don't come cheap. - I have no idea what you're talking about. - I'm talking about an offshore safety deposit box. We've been doing our homework on you, Mr. Peterson. - Who is we? Are you some kind of terrorist? Who the hell are you? - I'm the one who's gonna make you pay, Mr. Peterson, one way or another. - I cannot pay you $10 million in 24 hours, this is crazy! - Then your wife's dead, and you're dead. Maybe we'll be generous and leave the oxygen on and you can starve to death slowly, or die of thirst, and your wife, we'll cut her head off and stick it on a pike, just like South America. - Hey, now I told you that is a lie, that is an absolute lie, I don't know anything about that. - Sure, I've got you confused with someone else. - Yeah, maybe you do, maybe you do. - Another egomaniac business tycoon with delusions of morality and nobility. Nobody thinks they're a bad person, not even a monster. - You are a monster. - If I were you, I would start thinking about the contents of that security deposit box. - I have no idea what you are talking about. - All right, I can see you need a little coaxing. - Oh, god. Tom? Uh, we're maybe gonna have to, uh, clean out the rainy day fund. Uh, take this down, Tom. Yeah? - It's me. All right, I cleaned the rainy day funds but we're still gonna be short a couple mil. - Shit! - Anthony, again, are you sure this is the way you wanna go? Do you have any idea where you are? - Well, I told you, I am in a metal cargo container, man, trapped! - Can you hear anything, outside, that might just pinpoint where you are? - No, nothing. - Are you on land or on water? A ship, in the air maybe? - I don't fucking now, I'm on land, I guess, I haven't heard anything, you know, no turbulence, no engine, so nothing. - Then odds are you're indoors. I assume you've been pounding like a motherfucker to get out of there, so you're probably somewhere secluded. Is it hot or cold? - Um, it's cold. - How about the cellphone they gave you, any numbers or information that...? - No, no, I checked the whole thing, the numbers are all blocked, it's like a, you know, a knockoff, cheap knockoff. - What about the voice of the kidnapper? - Uh, well, American, maybe, I don't know, could be older, very sure of himself, like a guy with a gun to your head. He knows a lot about me, Tom. - Like what? - South America. - Oh, fuck. What's the last thing you remember? - Well, like I said to him, I was on the street and I was... I was in a bar, I remember, on 13th Street, and I went to the head, and when I came back, the drink I had tasted strange. I didn't think much about it at the time, but... - Did you notice anyone suspicious? - It's a dive bar, man, everything is suspicious. - So what do you want me to do about the rest of the money? - Sell the houses, all of 'em. - I can't, you're mortgaged in balls-deep as it is. - Well, I gotta get outta here, man, I got less than 24 hours of air left. Not to mention, are you ready for this? The motherfucker has hooked this entire place up like a damn electric chair! - What the fuck? Are you serious? - It is like having your brain in a red-hot cauldron inside your head. - Who would have the capital to set something like this up? You just heard the one voice on the phone, right? - Yeah, yeah. - Well, maybe it's not a crew, maybe it's just one guy, some rich fuck with a mastermind complex looking to torture some other rich fucks for his own sick fucking amusement. Maybe somebody you've burned on a business deal? - I never burned anybody that bad. - Well, good to see you still haven't lost your sense of humor during all of this. - Mr. Peterson? - Yeah. - How are you progressing? - Well, I cleaned out the rainy day funds like you said. - And? - And we're still gonna be a little short. - If you're short even one penny, or late one second on delivery, I'll kill you and your expensive trophy wife. - That is crazy, you're gonna throw away potential millions of dollars? - I'm a man of principle, you might say. - Yeah, you're a fucking idiot is what you are. - Now, I bet that was a real shock to the system. - Yeah, Tom, are you all right? - Oh, hey. - Have you been crying? - No, no, in fact, I was just about to call you back, but, uh, there's been a complication. - A complication? - Um, yeah, I think you're gonna have to call someone else. - No, no, Tom, no, I cannot call anybody else. You are my closest associate, you have all the access to everything, man. You're the only one I can trust! - I really think you should just call someone else. - Tom, what is wrong? - Well, when you called, I left something out, I wasn't alone, and I'm still not. - Who are you with? - Uh, a girl. - A prostitute? - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, we met online tonight. - Ah, Tom, listen, I'm not the person to lecture you on infidelity, but you do know that you are married to a pregnant woman with three small children at home, you know that, right? - Sure, it's just, well, it turns out, this girl, she was quite the party monster. - Why didn't you tell me this before? - Well, when you called, I thought I had it all under control, and I did, but it took a little turn for the worst. - What is she on now? - Nothing, just some low-grade acid, and some heroin, and a speedball or two, and a little coke to ease her down, some pot, vodka, and a little mescaline. - Are you high too, Tom? - No, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, I'm straight, I'm straight. - Tom, you have had two rehabs, I thought you were done with all of this? - Don't worry, it's just, well, she was vomiting in her sleep earlier. I mean, it's just now, I can't get her to wake up. I've tried everything. She's turning kinda blue, and I... - Well, you better call a doctor. - I can't call a fucking doctor, I've got two felony DUIs, third strike and I'm a goner. - All right, all right, now listen, you call Dr. Ivy, I'm absolutely sure that I gave you the number, it should be on your phone, Ivy, I-V-Y. He is a friend, he is very discreet, he is a specialist in these sort of things, you call him, he makes house calls. - I think she might be dead by the time he got here. - Well, then pick her up and get her out of there! Where are you? - The hotel, downtown. - Pick her up, wrap her up, and get her out of there. - Should I wipe the vomit and blood off her face before that? - Hey, you know, that's a good idea, Tommy. - Okay, I'm in the hallway now. Uh, there's some people coming toward me. Uh, hello, yeah, yes, she's fine, just a little too much late night debauchery. Okay, I'm outside now. - What's that, what happened now? - I just dropped her. - Well, pick her up. - Okay, I'm coming to the car, what do you think is best for her in this state, the trunk or the front seat? - Oh, well, put her in the front seat, be a gentleman, Tom. Tom, are you in park? Tom? - I just backed up into a streetlight. - Well, is anybody injured? - No, we're fine. - Well, then drive, baby. Drive, Tom! - Uh, red light coming up. - How is she looking? - Uh, not good. - Well, you're gonna have to run that red light. - Run the red light? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, how's the traffic up ahead? - Uh, good, clear. - Well, then run it, baby. - Oh...okay. Woo-hoo-hoo. Oh yeah, oh my god, that was my first red light. Oh my god, red light coming up again. - Everything all right? - Uh, going good, seems pretty clear. - Well, how's it look, how's the traffic? - Uh, I think I can make it. - Well, then do it, do it, baby. - Oh my fucking god, that was sweet! Uh, sharp turn coming up, are you supposed to accelerate or break on the sharp turns? - Your call. - Woo-hoo, oh my fucking god! - Tom, are you... is everything all right? - Good, both of us are. - Okay, great. Now listen to me, I'm going to be calling the doctor, I'm gonna tell him that you're on your way, and that you have a package in the trunk, and when everything is finished, what I want you to do is get back to me. Can you do that? - Yeah, I will, promise. - All right, thank you, Tommy. Hello? Hello? - Hello, jefe. - Who is this? - You know who this is. - Who are you? - Anthony, it's me, your old friend. - Sully? - That's right, Sully, your old friend and mentor. How are ya? Long time, no talk. - That's impossible. - Why? - Because Sully has been dead for over two years. - That's right, thanks to you. - Uh, what, are you saying that Sully didn't die? - Oh, I died all right, you saw to that. - Look, I don't know what you're talking about, you're obviously some kind of an impostor hired by the kidnappers just to fuck with me. - Anthony, do you even realize you're talking to a dead telephone right now? The phone didn't really ring when I called just now. It's all in your head. - Well, you're not real then, so fuck off! What? - Hello, dead man talking. - What do you want? - Hmm, you stopped taking your medication, haven't you? - You're not real, you're not real. - Oh, I'm real all right, I'm as real as the voice that pops up in your head when things really start to head south. - You're dead. - That's right, courtesy of you. Now why would you go and do a thing like that after everything I'd done for you? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Still buying into your own bullshit, it's gotten so bad, you believe it yourself. - I tell you what I do remember, I remember that you were fucking my wife! - Is that what this is all about, me fucking your wife? Well, hell, somebody had to, you certainly couldn't be bothered. You left the poor gal on her deathbed, AP. - You were a piece of shit! - And what are you? - Alive, unlike you, asshole! - Uh, yeah? - Evan, Evan, how are you, my son? - Are you all right, old man? That sounded almost endearing for you. - Well, actually, no, I'm in a bit of a clusterfuck here. - Huh, maybe we can talk about this in the morning? - No, no, no, we gotta talk about this now. - I see. What's up? - I have been kidnapped. - Pardon? - It's not a joke, I am being held in a metal cargo container somewhere. I have been talking to the kidnappers, I have less than 24 hours of air left unless I pay the ransom, and they have kidnapped your mother. - Uh, no, my mother's here. What you're saying is they kidnapped you and your trophy wife. Look, if this is some kind of sick fucking joke, it's already not funny! Secondly, you've got a phone, call the police. - If I call the police, she is dead, I am dead, you do not know these people, they are crazy! If I do not pay them the ransom, they're going to kill us both. - Why are you calling me? - I'm your father. - I don't know, Anthony, sometimes I feel like I should just say to you, "Hey, thanks for the sperm, "and let's just leave it at that." - I need your help. I'm short on the ransom, and I need... I need to borrow on you and your sister's trust fund. - So why the hell didn't you ask her? - Because Elena hates me more than your mother does. - No, that's not possible, no one hates you more than my mother. - I need your help, son. - Don't son me, Anthony! You and I are barely on a first-name basis. - I need some help here. - How much do you need? - All of it, I'll need it all, both of 'em. - You made your filthy fucking bed, Anthony. - Yeah, maybe so. But full disclosure, I do not need your permission! This was supposed to be a courtesy call anyway. - What? You can't do that. - Yes, I can, read the fine print, young man! - You filthy fucking pig-fucker son of a bitch, I swear to god I'm gonna kick your ass! - Why did you leave? Why did you walk out on Mom, you son of a bitch? - Evan, she was very sick, she was like an invalid. I could not live the rest of my life married to an invalid. - So you got yourself a cunt trophy wife and now you're calling to tell us, as a courtesy, that you're taking everything to get back that same cunt you left our dying mother for? Go to hell. - Yo? - We're losing her, Dr. Ivy. - Hey, Tom! - Vitals are dropping. - Her pressure's dropping, Doctor. - Tom, everything all right? - She's in defib. - Great, - Place the E-2 tube and start bagging. - just finishing up with the doc right now. - Do we got lines started? Good. - She's not responding. - What's happening now? - Get a board with a crash cart. - Nothing! - Quickly, please, we're losing her. - The doc's just giving her - Get a move on, let's go! a little jumpstart is all. - Get the crash cart, she's going into cardiac arrest. - It'll all be right in a minute. - Get the paddles. - All right, ready? Clear. - Tom, what's going on? - She's not responding. - Well, she's not breathing and she's not moving, so, my guess is... - One more time, ready, clear. - I think we're good. - Hey, she's back! - Did we get labs yet? I want a tox screen. - She's vomiting up a hell of a lot of blood, but she looks to be all right now. - Yeah, good, she's okay? - Can you hear me? Can you tell me your name? - Oh, sure. - Can you tell me what you took? - Okay, okay, then you gotta get the hell outta there right now. - Oh, this is not good. We're gonna have to get some charcoal in this girl, stat, - Uh, yeah. - to soak up whatever she ingested. Okay, I need you to get to the car and fire up the laptop. - Dr. Forest, please dial 1-1. - Okay, we are good to go. - Okay, good, now I think I got all the money. - Really? That's great. - Yeah, check my account, check it. - Holy fuck! It's all there, with interest. - All right, all right. - Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo, damn, you're good, son! How'd you come up with the last of the money? - My children's, uh, trust fund. - Damn, and if you think they didn't hate you already... - Now, look, here, I need you to wire this money to the account I gave you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's not be too hasty here, are you sure this is the way you wanna play this? - Well, what are you saying? - I'm not saying nothing, all I'm saying is there are opportunities that come around in life, opportunities that you should think very hard and long about before deciding your course of action. - Tom, are you high right now? - High? No. I just dropped some low-grade blotter acid to mellow me out, but I'm fine. Look, all I'm saying is we should consider... consider each and every option before proceeding. - Tom, this is my wife we're talking about here. - Well, come on, let's get real, trophy wife. - It's my wife! - Yeah, but is she really worth it? I mean, $10 million? That's kinda overkill, isn't it? Is any wife worth that much, I mean, really? Is any person worth that much? You think I'm kidding, my old man, if someone was ransoming me for $10 million, he'd just say, "Screw it, "I'll just make another one that looks just like him." - It's also my life we're talking about, my life. - Yeah, you know, I've been thinking about that, like I said, is anyone's life worth that much, I mean, really? Mine, yours? Life is cheap, not expensive. - What are you proposing? - Proposing? I'm just saying... I mean, the situation as it stands now, you really are at my mercy, right? I mean, you trust me to do the right thing, to care about you, your trophy wife, especially with you locked away somewhere, who knows where, left alone to slowly die for who knows what, all alone, no trace, never to be seen again, I mean, theoretically, I could just hang up this phone and go on my merry way. - Tom, hey, we're friends. - Yeah, friends. Everybody needs friends when they're down and out, don't they? In desperate times with desperate measures? But what about employees? That's right, employees. Long-suffering employees who are bitter at being passed over from promotion after promotion, being snubbed again and again when it comes time to hand out the year's bonuses, bitter and angry employees with a serious grudge against their employer of many, many years, employees who've had to eat shit over and over again. - What do you want, Tom? - Well, you know, internet gambling looks mighty good right about now. Tell you what, I said it was all there with interest, I take the interest, wire the rest to whoever you say, we're done. I'll take that silence as a yes. Finito. - Hello? Hello? - Hey there. - Evan? - Yeah, how's it going? Um, I just called to tell you that you were the shittiest father ever. - Evan, have you been drinking? - Yeah, but you know something? I was never much of a son anyway. - No, now that's not so, that's not so. - No, my whole life has been like that. I'm just a rich prick living off of his parents' money. But what I wanted to do was, um, call to say goodbye. I, um, I called the police. - Huh? - I know you said I shouldn't, since your, uh, friends might be listening. And don't worry, I didn't give them your number, I mean, I couldn't since it's blocked on my phone. I'm not even sure they believe me. - Evan, Evan, I told you you cannot call the police, they will kill us. - That's the idea. After everything you've done, you taking away my trust fund was the last straw in a long line of indignities. I figure with you and the step-bitch out of the way, everything would just inherit on back to me, and that's way too much money to blow on ransoming a dried up, old trophy wife and an even older man suffocating in a metal box. - Jesus Christ, you have just killed me! - Really? I hope so, Daddy. - Mr. Peterson, didn't anyone ever tell you rules aren't meant to be broken? You're going to die, Mr. Peterson. You're going to die and feel your brains boiling inside your head. Then when that's done, your eyeballs are going to explode out of your head and paint the walls like modern art, and then, your head's going to explode like a fucking volcano. - It wasn't me. - Yes, Mr. Peterson, it wasn't you. Don't get your hopes up, no one's coming to save you. The information your son gave the police was sketchy at best, but, regardless, the rules of the game have been broken, and you must pay the penalty. - Penalty, what the fuck are you talking about? - 20 million. - What? - The ransom is now double, 20 million, or you both die. - 20 million? I can't come up with that much money, it's impossible. - 20 million. - 20? It's impossible! Huh? What the hell is that? Compromise, Mr. Peterson. - Compromise? - One body part, one million. Remove one body part, remove one million ransom. - You've gotta be shitting me! - No, I don't think so. - Well, this is crazy. - It's very simple, Mr. Peterson, each body part has its own monetary value: one toe, one million, one finger, two million, one foot, four million, one hand, five million, one arm, eight million, one leg, 10 million, but you can only remove up to 10 million in ransom. - Go fuck yourself. Relax, Mr. Peterson, we can't expect you to sever an entire limb with that tiny, blunt object. We'll make it easy: one tooth, one million. - I'm not doing that. - Have a seat, Mr. Peterson. Now put me on speakerphone and put the phone down. Not to worry, it has a special shock-proof case, you don't. - Fuck, I am doing it! - Very good, Mr. Peterson. Now, once again. Can you talk, Mr. Peterson? - Yes, uh, yes. - 10 teeth, 10 million. - Go fuck yourself. Yeah? - Hey, boss man, it's your very own right-hand man. - What do you want, Tom? - Well, uh, before I head out the door, I wanted to call to let you know you're still about a million and change short. - What? Wait a minute, you said that... - Yeah, uh, I know what I said, but I just found out that some of your investments were sold off. They didn't get nearly the returns we expected. - Oh, all right, all right, uh, all right, uh, okay, okay, I got an idea, I have a place, a business in Fairfax I hardly ever go to, do you know it? - Sex boutique? - No, no, jewelry. - Jewelry store? - Right. - Oh, yeah, yeah, you bought it on the cheap when the owner got 20-to-life for wholesaling fake stones. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, here's the thing: I want you to rob it. - Oh, man, you can't be serious? - Serious. - Anthony, that's crazy. I know you're under a hell of a lot of stress right now, but be reasonable, I am no heist man. - It's gonna be easy, I'm gonna talk you into, I'm gonna tell you where the keys are, the alarm codes, and I'll walk you through it, you'll be in and out in five minutes. - Yeah, just like when I'm having sex. - Listen, we can do this, you can do this! - It's too crazy. - Hey, I'm gonna... I'll tell you what, I'm gonna give you 50,000 over the severance pay that you took, how's that? - Make it 100 and it's a deal. - Done, are you in the car? - Uh, negative. - Well, get in it and drive. - Okay, where to? - My place, we gotta get the keys to the jewelry store. - Yeah, golden, I'm not far from there. Is there a gate or an entry code? - Yeah, 6-6-6. - 6-6-6, subtle. Oh, tripped over some garbage cans , and I'm back, and running. I'm headed around back at your place, to be safe. - No, no, no, don't go, don't go to the back! - There's a rather mean-looking dog here. - Yeah, that's what I was trying to tell you. - What's... what's his name? - Satan. - Is he... is he friendly? - Well, he's an attack dog, he's named after the Prince of Darkness, what do you think? - I'm gonna try and make a run for it. - No, Tom, don't do that! - Oh, shit! - Tom? - It bit my leg! Oh shit! - You all right? - Get him off me! Oh, shit. - The key to the door should be in the plant. - Come on, come on, come on, come on. I'm in! - All right, uh, the alarm code, the alarm code. - Yeah, number of the beast. Where, where, where, where, where to? - Upstairs, the master bedroom. And don't kill yourself on the stairs. - Yeah, Roger Wilco. Whereabouts? What am I looking for? - Dresser drawer, under the porno mags, there's a large keyring, pocket notebook. - Got it, I'm out. - All right. - Outside now, all good. - Did you just slide down the upstairs banister? - Yeah, side-saddle, old-style. Oh, what the fuck? - What? - Oh, that fucker jumped the fence! - Ah, get out of there, man, just go. - Shit! - Are you all right, Tom? - Yeah, I'm in the car. - Well, boy, drive, dammit, drive. Hey, Tom, what's happening? - Yeah, one second. - Tom? Get going. - Okay, I'm outside, parked in the alley behind the jewelry place, looks deserted. - Are you dressed for the occasion? - Yeah, all black, black ski mask, black gloves, what now? - Okay, well, coast clear, head around to the back. - Can't I just go into the front this time? - No, no, no, believe me, the back is safer, trust me. How's your leg? - I will survive. - The big silver key will get you in. - I'm in. - Okay, good. Now, when you get in... - Tom? - Yeah? - What, what, uh, what's going on? - There is a guy here, he's got a gun at my head. - What? - He's got a gun at my head, a big one. - Uh, I think he's a security guard... - When the fuck did they hire a security guard? - How long has it been since you've been to this place? - Look, just tell him to stay calm. - He doesn't speak English. - Well, you stay calm, Tom. - I can't stay calm, there is a creepy-ass Mexican who doesn't speak English with a .357 pointed at my head and he's about to shoot me in the fucking face! - Tom? Who is this now? - He's dead. - What? - The security guard, he's dead, he shot himself through the chest. We were both struggling with the gun and it just went off! - Uh, the alarm, uh, use the code I gave you. You think anyone heard the shot? - I don't know, maybe, it was pretty quiet. - The small gold key will open the lockbox on the wall, um, inside is a kill switch for the security, the cameras, everything. - Got it. - All right, time to go shopping, baby! Okay, we're gonna go to the main showroom with the glass cases. Take your hammer and your bag and smash and grab, baby, smash and grab! - I'm at where the glass jewelry cases are. - Well, do it to it, do it to it! That's it, that's it, grab 'em all! - Okay, that's done, safe? - Uh, safe's in the back, you use the combo I gave you. - If they haven't changed it. - Well, yeah. - Opening. Looking good, boss man. - All right, you got it all? Get out, baby! - Got it. Hell yeah, we made it! - All right, now be very careful, do not attract any attention to yourself. - Run right, gotcha. So where are we headed? - We're going to the Southland, are you ready, of Booth and Lincoln. Now, uh, there is a Army Surplus store there, an old one with a reliable fence, he's there 24-7, he will give you 50 cents on the dollar for everything, whatever you got. - Sounds perfecto. - What, what? What's going on? - There is a cop behind me. - Well, stay calm, stay calm. - I am! He just pulled up behind me out of nowhere. - Well, you think maybe somebody called in the shot? - Maybe! I think I just figured out why he pulled up behind me. - Why? - I just realized I'm still wearing my ski mask, he must've spotted me. - Why did you forget the ski mask? - I just forgot in all of the excitement. - Well... - Shit, he's pulling me over. - Well, get out, man, get out! - We're losing him! - All right, all right, good, where are you right now? - Coming up on Main and Gleason. - Okay, hang a hard right. - Your wish, my command. Oh yeah, bat meets hell! - All right, now, there is an old parking structure, should be coming up, pull into that, and keep going. - Gotcha, gotcha. Yeah, uh, parking structure, coming up... Coming right up, now. Jesus, this place is like a maze. Uh, no sign of the cop. - Okay, good, now don't, don't, don't go through the back entrance. Look to your left, and go out that exit. - Hey, how'd you know that? Does that phone got GPS? - I know this town like you know the feel of your right hand, boy. - Well, you must know it pretty damn well. A side exit coming up. And we are... clear. No sign of him. So, what's next, papa bear? - Just keep going straight ahead. - Oh shit! - Tom! - Uh, ah, uh, give me a second. - Are you all right? - Uh, yeah, I'm good, a little banged up, but, uh, good. Your car is totally totaled though. - You sure you're all right? - Yeah, I was wearing my seatbelt. Freak accident. - Well, what the hell happened? - Oh, fuck, another car came out of nowhere. I had to swerve to keep from hitting it. Hit a lamppost, knocked the fucker down at the base like a lumberjack, it's lying across, blocking the road like a big old tree. - The other car? - Ah, the lamppost landed on top of it, crushed it. - Anybody hurt? - Um, they appear to be okay, couple of scratches, looks to be a family of some sort, really young, cousins maybe, they're over sitting on the other side of the street on the curb of the sidewalk. They're all on their cellphones. Uh, they look to be tweeting and updating social media about it. They're taking selfies now. I don't think they speak English either. How the hell did they fit so many of them in one damn car? Must've been a clown car. - Well, you gotta get outta there, man. - Uh, well, there's a problem with that. - What? - The cop, he's here, he looks like he's just about done calling the accident in on his radio. - Get out of there, man! - Uh, well, he's walking right toward me, and he's got his gun drawn. - Put your hands on your head and interlace your fingers. - He looks seriously pissed off. - Put the phone down. Put your hands in the air. - He's telling me to put down the phone and put my hands in the air. - Tom, Tom, you used to box, right? - Helluva time to bring that up now, okay, but yeah, yeah, I did, Golden Gloves, undefeated. - Put your hands on your head and interlace your fingers. - I need you to punch out the cop. - You want me to what? - Punch the cop out! - Seriously? - Seriously! Just lay him out, can you do that? - Well, I can certainly give it a try, but it's a cop. - Ah, it's just a person. How big is he? - Pretty big. He's getting close. - Walk backwards towards me. - All right, just be cool and do what he says until he gets close enough. - He's got his gun drawn on me! - Just be cool. - Stop. - And when he gets close... You've gone this far haven't you? - Okay, okay, it's cool, it's cool. - Get on your knees and keep your hands on your head. - And knocked the man out in one shot! - You did it? He's down? - The man is down for the count! The people across the street look to be tweeting about it, I think one of them might've got it on video, might be uploading it now. Uh, but it's okay, I've still got my ski mask on. - Do you still have a full gas can in the trunk of your car for emergencies? - Uh, yes, I do. Looks to be the only part of the car that isn't wrecked. - All right, uh, what about the jewelry? You still got the jewelry? - Yeah, I got the jewels. - All right, I want you to douse the wreck with the gasoline and burn it. You need to torch the getaway vehicle. Then, handcuff the cop with his own cuffs, hogtie him, put him in the back of the police car... No, no, in the trunk, in the trunk, then drive the police car, switch your ski mask with the cop's hat, and get the hell out of there before, um, backup comes, okay? - I am on it! Come on, baby, come on. Handcuffed and hogtied. And we are outta here! - Yeah, you gotta kill the siren, Tom. - Oh, yeah, right, right. - All right, now get to the fence and cash out. - Uh, this fence, do you trust him? - Implicitly, he can buy and sell anything. - Really? Do you think he can fence this police car? - Maybe so, I don't know why not. - Uh, what about the pig hogtied in the back? - Strip him naked, leave him handcuffed, face-down, in an alley somewhere. Odds are he's gonna be so embarrassed that he's not gonna say anything or file a report. - Done and done, Anthony. - Thank you, Tom, thank you. Mr. Peterson? - Yeah? - Your time is nearly up. - I got it, I got the money, now you just tell me when, I will text you my account and all the information. - You send it to me now, Mr. Peterson. - No, I need to speak to my wife first. - This just in, statistics show the threat - Anthony, please help me. - of the kidnapping of wealthy families is at an all-time high. - Oh, sweet baby girl, it's gonna be okay. I swear to you, it'll be over soon. - Now, Mr. Peterson. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Well done. Now there's just one more thing, I'm still going to kill you and your wife. - What? - You heard me. - Why? I did everything you asked for! You got the money, why? - It is all there, and you did do everything I asked. - Well, then why are you doing this? - Because you're a bad man, Mr. Peterson. - Look, just let her go, please let her go! I don't care what you to do to me, just please let her go! - Would it hurt you more than anything else in the world to see anything happen to her? - Yes, yes! - Well, that's reason enough there. Make it hurt! - Ah, ah! No! Stop it! No! No, don't! Please! Oh, Jesus, you dirty fucking motherfucker! Ah, you cocksucker! - And Mr. Peterson, I've got plans for you. You don't get the easy way out, Mr. Peterson. You're going to die slowly and alone, all alone in the dark. I'm pulling the plug on you, Mr. Peterson. Over and out. - Hello. - Anthony? - Oh, Sully, you're not real. - I'm as real as you make me. I just wanted to call and say goodbye. You know, you are right where I thought you always belonged, alone in the dark, dying, no one coming to save you, sealed in your own perfect little tomb. Peaceful, isn't it? You're halfway there, Anthony. - Where? - You're almost lying down, now just die! - Merc. - Yes? - Merc? - Anthony? Sweet baby Jesus, man, what's it been, years? - Merc, I need your help. - Sure, man, anything you need, amigo. - I have been kidnapped, Merc. I have been kidnapped and held for ransom. They snatched Susan too, they said they were going to kill us both. I paid them $10 million and they still killed Susan! And they have left me here to die, I am in a metal cargo container, somewhere, I don't know where. - Why the hell didn't you call me first, man? - They were listening, they said that if I called anyone that wasn't related to the ransom, they would kill us both, and they have been torturing me, man! They electrocuted me, they got this whole place hooked up like a torture chamber. - Do you know if they're listening now? - I don't know, I don't think so, they said they're gonna pull the plug. - Do you have any idea where you are? - No, no, no, inside I think. I mean, I don't hear any weather or anything like that. I don't know where these people are that put me in here. They said they're controlling this remotely. They could be just on the outside of this container for all I know. - Is there anything on the inside of the container that you might have missed? A serial number, a shipping line, anything? - No, nada, nada, I've checked this fucker out, believe me. - Was there anything that the kidnappers might've said to tip you off? Background noise, anything? - I've only talked to one guy, very serious, no accent, probably American. - So they lock you in there with just your cellphone, any clues there? - Yeah, it's just a nondescript cellphone. The numbers are blocked and, you know, I don't know what... I think I'm out of power here almost. - So, kidnapper, not foreign, indoors, possibly in a place that is soundproof or just deserted, and, taking a wild guess here, most likely somewhere in North America. That about narrows it down. Are you sure you didn't hear anything else? - Well... Hey, when they brought Susan over to talk to me, before they killed her, I think I heard a TV, or a radio, some kind of a broadcast, they must've forgot and left it on, and, Merc, I think I heard the announcer say the station ID. - What was it? - Uh... K-O-N-E. - That's local, not nationwide, isn't it? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's the Hollywood Hills. Hollywood Hills, Santa Monica mountains, checking satellite now, plus I'm putting feelers out on the street to see if there's anything... any suspicious activity. Back at you, Anthony. - You motherfuckers. Yeah? - This is Merc, I think we may have found your boys. They're mountainside, like we suspected, held up in a veritable fortress, secluded, way off the beaten path. They look organized and well-armed. I'm not gonna lie, there looks to be a small army there. Now, I can have a team assembled in no time. Tell me what you want us to do. - Payback. - We're nearly there, we've got 12 men, four vehicles, no other vehicles on the road. Snipers are in place to take out the guards, multiple tangos, there was a lot of 'em, your call, maim or kill? - Kill 'em, kill 'em! No survivors, go for the head shots, no survivors! - I'm about to crash the front gates, hang on! We're pinned down! Jesus, we fucked up not anticipating! Use the mini-gun, move, now! Escort me to the main compound, now! Freeze! We got enemy combatants throwing down their weapons, surrendering. - Waste 'em! Waste 'em! Make 'em bleed! - Jesus, we got more of 'em coming from upstairs! - Kill, kill, kill! Merc, Merc, Merc? - I'm okay, took three to the chest, fuck! Headed to the top floor now. - You gonna make it? - Yeah, I'm all right, cracked a couple of ribs, that's all. I took all three to the vest. - Merc, the ringleader, I want that man alive! - Roger that. Headed down a long hallway now. There's an armored double door at the end. Holloway, use the grenade launcher, nuke that mother! All right, we're in. Jesus, Anthony, oh Jesus. We found your wife. Jesus, they... God, they... they cut her open, chainsaw, it looks like. Anthony, I'm so sorry. Don't move, motherfucker, don't move! On your knees, get down now! Now you watch that motherfucker, if he moves, you smoke him! Anthony, I think we found your host for the evening. - I'll double your... No! Triple! - Merc? - Yeah? - Soften him up just a little bit, make him bleed. How does he sound now? Hey, Merc, did you bring the ax? - You know it. - No, no, please! - You know something, you were right, I was setting an example, do not fuck with Anthony Peterson. Merc, give him the old red queen special. Merc? - Yeah? - Do me one favor, before you leave, take the motherfucker's head outside and stick it on a pike. - Just like South America? - Yeah. Merc? - Anthony, we got your locale, you're in an abandoned warehouse out in Los Angeles Harbor, Pier X, we can be there ASAP. - The money? - Every dollar back, my friend. You're covered. - All right, take your share plus a half a million, add that on to it. - Mr. Generosity. - Yeah, give the rest to my children. - Done. Now just kick back, relax, we're gonna have you out of there in no time. - Uh, now listen, Merc, I need you to make yourself scarce. - Why, what's up? - Well, I'm calling the police, I'm confessing everything. - You what? Are you out of your fucking mind? - I'm going state's evidence on everybody, including you. - You what? Anthony, just calm down, okay? You're not thinking straight. - No, I made up my mind. - Well, why the hell are you even telling me this? - Because we are friends, and I wanna give you a heads up so you can get the hell out of there. - To what? To get lost, to get out of the country? Anthony, why the fuck are you doing this? - 'Cause I'm a bad guy, and so are you. I don't have anything else left out there at all. - Anthony, you know what I'm gonna have to do if you do this. - Goodbye. Thank you, Merc. I gotta make some calls, I'll see you around. - Yeah, well, not if I get there first, asshole. - LAPD. - This is Anthony Peterson, I have been kidnapped and held for ransom. My wife, Susan, has been murdered by my abductors. I hired a group of mercenaries to eliminate them and they are all dead, you're going to find them in an abandoned compound in the mountains outside the city. I hired these same mercenaries to murder a group of people in South America over a bad business deal. I'm being held in a metal cargo container in an abandoned warehouse in Los Angeles Harbor, Pier X. You better send somebody to come and arrest me. - Whoa, what? - Yeah? - Anthony? - Sully. - Atta-boy. - I am not your boy!
