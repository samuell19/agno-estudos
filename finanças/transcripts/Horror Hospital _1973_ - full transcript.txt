Now make a clean job of it, Frederick. The car was washed this morning. Now, Frederick. That'll teach them to try and run away from us. Be sure not to let it happen again, Frederick. ♪ My blood runs stone cold ♪ I'm looking at the golden eyes of evil ♪ ♪ And the mark of death ♪ Is painted everywhere I go ♪ In the black of the night ♪ And the moon's shimmering light ♪ ♪ Something ain't right ♪ Something ain't right ♪ Something ain't right ♪ Something is wrong Look at that. They stole my song. Whole week's work up the spout. Silly little red faggot swirling about in his own smoke. Who does she think she is? Greeta Garbo? Looks more like a Lemon Meringue Pie on heat. What you want, faggot boy, hey? ♪ And you mind, take some time outside ♪ Oh, I'm getting out of this bloody music business. All I did was make those shits a present of a song. - Have you been snorting coke again, Jason? Piss off. You're quite right, Jason, you should get away. Yes Jason, go away to the country for a few days. You could do with a rest. Yes, and you'll need the funny farm. Hey, look at this. A holiday. Yeah, that's a good idea. I think I will. Sun and fun for the under 30's. Well that's me, just. Hairy Holidays. Yeah, I fancy something a little hairy. Yeah, might be some nice birds down there. Ah, come on in. What can I do for you? Well it's this uh, Hairy Holiday. Just what do you have in mind? How about a nice sunny trip to the Bahamas? Oh. A cheap charter to the sand dunes of the Sahara? Ah, here we are, just the thing. How about a few days in the country, fresh air, birds, flowers and storm your way back to health? Ah yes, you could do with a few early nights, couldn't you? Yes, this is what I was thinking of. How much does it cost? Well for you dear, we'll make a special price, 25 pounds for the whole week, all in. Yes, well, that seems all right. Uh, I'd like to go now, today. Well here's the address and the instructions how to get there and there's one of their cards. Ah, thanks. No, no, no pay when you get there. But if you ever change your mind about that trip to the Bahamas, come and see me and we'll work something out together, eh? Oh yes, sure. Goodbye, young man and enjoy yourselves. Hi, that taste good? It's not bad, thank you very much. Well you're lucky, I didn't have time for any lunch. Here, would you like one of these apples? I think I'll go and get some coffee. There's no need to get so uptight about things. I'm not gonna rape you. I'm sorry, but I'm always a bit timid with people on trains. Would you like a piece of cheese as well? Right, let's start again. Where are you going? To visit my aunt. It's rather strange really. I've never met her. Well she used to run a house in the red light district of Hamburg before the second World War. But my mother had a terrible rile with her because of her whore house and I was never allowed to meet her, but now mother's died and Aunt Harris is my only living relative. Oh Harris wasn't her real name. She always wore Harris tweed suits. That's how she got her nickname. She has to execute my mother's will. But why can't you? Well because, isn't it funny how one doesn't mind telling strangers secrets? You see, mother never married and I'm well, illegitimate. Oh hell, nobody gives a damn about that sort of thing now-a-days. No, not now, but they did in those days. That's why mother and Aunt Harris never saw eye-to-eye. Aunt Harris accused my mother of being a hypocrite, but why shouldn't she run a brothel when her sister wasn't even married? I think that's why mother stayed single all her life, just to spite my aunt. Then the war came and Aunt Harris met up with this strange Finnish doctor. The brothel was bombed and she moved to Helsinki with him. He's a real weirdie, old Storm. Oh so you're going to Brittle House too? How did you guess? Well old Storm advertised in the paper for his health hotel and I'm gonna go there and try and get myself together. Had a bad time with a group I've been with. Really, what happened? Not much, had a rile of a song I wrote and lost me job. Was it a good song? Well I thought so. So did our manager, that's why he slung me out. Will you sing it for me now? ♪ No I wrote to my aunt and asked her to send a car to the station. We can give you a lift if you like. Fantastic. Anyway, your Dr. Storm is supposed to have this really weird therapy which is supposed to cure all your hangups in a week. I can just imagine them getting up to something like that. Why? Oh nothing. Popular place, isn't it? Mm. All right. Your tickets please. Oh yeah, okay? You sure you wrote to your aunt? Well she didn't reply, but I did post the letter over a week ago in London. Well they'll be here soon. Oh come on, let's go and sit down. Look, there must be a bus or something. I'll go and ask the old man. Yeah, excuse me, could you tell me how to get to Brittle House Manor? We were gonna be met, but nobody came. You go up the slope, turn right, it's about two miles up the road. There's a sign. Right, thanks. Hello? Is that the manor? Well, you have two here and they have not been met. Yes, I've sent them on their way. You sure you don't want me to take the case? No, no thanks. Oh shit. At this rate, we'll catch pneumonia before we even get to the health hotel. I'd give anything for a nice cup of tea. Yeah, me too. With a touch of something in it. Definitely. Oh, blimey. Oh look, look, we'll go and shelter in that old arch, yes? Yeah. Oh hey, you're nice. What's your name? Judy, Judy Peters, what's yours? Jason, Jason Jones, pleased to meet you. Oh. Listen, Judy, let's run back to the station. Jesus, I'd rather spend the night on the platform than here, yes? Yes. Right. Thank you. Cheery, isn't it? Jolly little place. My you look like a couple of drowned rats. You'd better come inside. - Hi, I'm Jason Jones. Really? You didn't reserve. Well, I've come from Hairy Holidays. Oh, I can see that. Well, I have got one room left. But you don't understand, we're not exactly together. Yet. Well what is it then? I have only got one room. You'll have to take it for the night anyway. But you don't understand, I'm here to see my Aunt Harris. You're, I thought I wrote and told you not to come. So you're Aunt Harris? Well I didn't get a letter. Well, we'll talk about that later. You'd better go and change your wet things. Frederick will show you to your room. It's a large room. You'll be able to arrange something. Just married or is it a couple of runaways then? We had a couple of runaways this morning. No games after 10:00, if you want to get your health back. It's all this advertising in the newspapers that brings people like you here. It's more like a hospital than a health spa. I hope you'll be tidier than the people who had that room. Nothing to worry about. Uh, we all have our little accidents, you know? Now um, you'll hear the gong for dinner so why don't you make yourselves comfortable and get settled in? Little lack of tenants. Won't be anywhere left to go to soon. Ah. Hello? You know who this is. Well Pollack, I've only had one this week. Hm, that magazine that you advertise in can't have a very large circulation. And your husband's health thing can't have much appeal, my dear. Remember this time, I want to get paid. Anyway, my spies have told me you've only got two, not one. You're wrong as usual, Pollack. The other one's a niece of mine. I didn't know you had any relatives that wanted to visit you anymore. Neither did I. And it's a bloody nuisance. Certainly complicates things. Well nevermind dear. Take care and remember, blood is thicker than water. Oh go to hell. Oh, she doesn't want them there, I'll send 'em somewhere else, I suppose. Jason, pass me the towel. How long are you going to stay here? Oh, don't know really. I never think about the future. Few days, I guess. Here, let me dry your hair. I'm not so sure I want to stay here very long. It's a very strange feeling in this house. Don't be so touchy. I think I'd better take a shower. Thought I'd come and chat while you splash. Help me. Hello little girl. And how are you? Hm, I am getting rather hungry. Come on, Jason. Let's have some of this health food. There's nothing healthier than uh, sex. Let's save it for after dinner. Hello, we've just arrived. How long have you been here? How's the food here? Well, you two seem to have settled in quite nicely. Our friends here seem to have settled in rather too nicely. Don't you think, Jason? Aunt Harris, what's that thing they've all got on their heads? Well don't concern yourself about them. They're very happy. They're advanced students. They don't speak again until they've been cured. Cured of what? Of what they came here for. It will all be explained to you when you meet Dr. Storm. What the fuck's going on here? There's no need for bad language, young man. Millie has an acute nervous disorder and Dr. Storm has still to perform his medical on her. I think I'd like to go to our room now. Yes, I'll come with you. Very well then. Sleep well. Don't forget to brush your teeth. So you lie down for a minute, Judy. You'll be all right. Jason, do you really think that girl was suffering from a nervous disorder? Well she was certainly hysterical whatever she was suffering from. Gave me such a shock, especially those two men that came to take her away. You just stay quiet for a minute. I'll get a cold towel for your head. There we go. Women can be very troublesome, Mr. Jones. But then so can little men. Oh my goodness. When you leave here, young lady, this sort of thing won't distress you anymore. Well I want to leave right now. Olga, who is this young lady? She's my late sister's daughter. I thought you wrote and told her not to come. Well I did. Guess who was supposed to have posted the letter. You don't have to leave here tonight. There's no way you can possibly go anywhere. The grounds have been closed. So stay in your room and you'll be quite safe. Don't forget to brush your teeth. Jason, what are we going to do? I'm so afraid. I'm a little scared myself. But I'd like to know what's going on here. What do you think he's doing to those kids? I don't know. He seems to have them under his control. We'll stay here until everyone's gone to bed, then we'll take a look around. Try and have a little rest now. Don't do anything silly. I wouldn't want anything to happen to you. Well I can take care of myself. And you too. You first. Oh. - Thank God I met you on the train. I don't know what I would have done if I'd been here alone. There must be a way out of here somewhere. Look, I'm going to take a look around. If you want something, shout. Jason. Jason, Jason. Jason! Judy! Pollack is here. He's being difficult. He wants more money. Then give it to him. But-- A man like Pollack should always get what he deserves. Oh very well then. Pollack will be leaving in five minutes. Deal with him. Mirror mirror on the wall, don't say a word, I know it all. Here you are, Pollack. In Hamburg, in the old days, we had ways of dealing with blackmailers. Oh come now, beautiful. Blackmail is a very strong word. After all, none of us are perfect, are we? Well you'd better go now before the dogs smell a rat. Oh, if you really think so. Yes. 'Til we meet again. Good day, dear lady. Good day. Oh how kind. - Morning. Jesus. Are you people going out of your minds? Why? What have you done with Judy? What was going on with that girl last night? And what goes on downstairs behind those locked doors, eh? It leads down to the gymnasium and then-- Yes, and then what? And then Dr. Storm's laboratory. What laboratory and what goes on in there? That's where they do the operation. Operation? I don't know. Something to do with their heads. There's a lot of electrical equipment in there. Didn't I just see that guy, Pollack, being slaughtered down there in the driveway? Yeah, he was being difficult. Let me go, let me go! I'm just as much a prisoner here as you are. I'll talk to you later. Good morning, Jason. I suppose you've been wondering what's going on here? You're damn right I have. Where's Judy? All in good time, dear boy. You deserve an explanation and you shall have one. Come, I'll show you around. This is the gymnasium where we keep our young guests fit. Oh you know Judy's Aunt Harris, don't you? Hello Jason. Did you sleep well? Watch Jason. These young people are completely under my control. Olga. You see? Just like puppets and I'm the puppet master. Puppets who feel no pain. Now Jason, go and look through that grill over there. - Judy! Judy! Judy! It's no use shouting, Jason. They can't hear you. We've given them a sleeping draft. It's very simple, we make an incision and perform a little operation. It's Millie's turn next, then Judy and yours will come soon. Like hell it will! It's no use, Jason! You won't get very far! It's no use, Jason, you won't get very far. Oh God, God, God. Enough of this. Lock him up immediately in the cell. Let me out of here! If you ever change your mind about that trip to the Bahamas, come and see me. We can work something out together, eh? - It's very simple you see. We make an incision. Yes, Jason, rather more than an incision, a tunnel into the mind, through which I can grab a little thought with my psychic hands or put one there, make it serve my purpose or your purpose, make you think that my purpose is your purpose, but I need more subjects to find the missing link. It'll be Millie's turn next, then Judy's and your turn will come soon. It'll be Millie's turn next. Christian, I've been thinking. Have you, my dear? I've been thinking for many years and I've achieved quite a lot in that time, don't you think? Yes, rather too much I'm afraid. You no longer confide in me, after that appalling business with Pollack and now this young man, Jason, someone's going to get suspicious. Don't be ridiculous. Anybody who's ever had any dealings with that scoundrel Pollack will only be too glad to see the back of him. As for these young people, they come and go like flies these days, dirty ones at that. Their disappearance will hardly be noticed. Besides, you don't think I've engineered all this equipment for all these years for nothing, do you? Pass me the scalpel. Well, this is the last one I'll help you with. Very well, Olga. And what will you do? I can always go back to Hamburg. You're too old to run a whorehouse. Thank you. People twice my age have managed to make ends meet. Yes. Hello? Is that the manor? It's old Carter down at the station. Well what does he want? Hm. He says he's just sent someone else up. Who? We're not expecting anyone. A young man. Well you'd better get yourself tidied up and meet him. Thank you. Who are you? I'm Abraham Warren. Well what do you want? Um, I'm looking for my girlfriend. See, we had a fight a few weeks ago and she disappeared. I found this magazine with your advertisement in it and, well I wondered if she was here. This is her photograph here. I see. Wait here a moment, will you? You see, I told you so. Things are not going as smoothly as you think. Lock him up with the other one. Who knows how many people know that he came here. I'm getting out now and I'm going to take Judy with me. Send the car around to the front. I'm going to pack my things. Very well, if that's what you want. - Hey, wake up. Wake up, man. Huh. What are you doing here? Don't quite know myself. Came to find my chick. What's going on around here? Oh it's all so bloody crazy. But the important this is, we've got to get out of here. The place is run by some kooky doctor and his wife who brainwash a lot of young kids and I haven't found out why yet. Jesus Christ. Have you seen a chick called Millie yet? May be too late for her. Oh my God, if they hurt her, if I get a hold of them, I'll tear them to pieces! Cool it, cool it. Our only chance is a freaky little dwarf they've got. Seems he's been given a bad time too. Well how do we contact him? Oh search me, he's a wily little bugger. He usually brings the food in, but whatever we do, we've got to keep cool. They can fill this box with some kind of knockout gas. What happened? You fainted, my dear. Jason, where's Jason? He's having a little rest. Where's Aunt Harris? She's gone away. Where? Oh well, in a way you could say that she's gone back to where she came from. That terrible face, I saw a terrible face! Don't get excited, my dear, the imagination can play strange tricks. Come, I want to show you something. Bring in our pretty little friend. You remember our little friend from last night? You see how much happier she looks now. Come towards me, Millie. Stop. Start. Stop. Hold out your hand. Put it down. You see, Judy, she's absolutely obedient. Whatever my will desires. What does your will desire, doctor? That you'll find out when it's your turn. ♪ Goodnight Grub up, boys, luncheon is served. - Boy, what have you done to get us out of this place? - Yeah, what have you done? Patience is a virtue that youth doesn't know much about. I've slipped the two guards a mickey fin. It's should work any minute now. How many times it's been eaten, eh? Throw it over to the two wimpies. Let me out now. Five, four, three, two, one. Right, well done. Now where's Judy? She's locked in the room, next to the gym. You know the way. Judy. Judy! Wake up, Judy! Judy! Jason. - Oh Judy. Oh Jason, I thought I'd never see you again. Oh it's horrible, it's horrible what they did to Millie. That terrible face. What are you talking about? - Millie, what do you know about Millie? Who are you? Oh he's Abraham. He's a friend, came here looking for his chick. Sorry, there's no time to explain. We've got to get away from this dreadful place. Right, let's go, quick. Millie, Millie, baby. Millie, baby. Millie, baby, I'm sorry. What have they done to you? What have they done to her? What in God's name? How convenient to find you all here together. You can tell me over dinner how you escaped from your cell. It won't make any difference how much of the truth you find out now. I wasn't always a cripple. I was very attractive to women once. In the late 20's, before Stalin came to power, I was a disciple of Acadamission Pavlov. Wow. Then when Stalin did come to power, he installed many young scientists, stupid adolescents who didn't know what they were doing. Very soon, my laboratories were overrun by these young Turks and I was made to leave. Being told what to do by these stupid students, so I went to Finland where I started my own private zoo. There I made experiments with animals. After a while, animals were not enough. I can't work with animals anymore. I must have humans! And that, Judy, is where your Aunt Harris was most useful. I used to visit her whorehouse as a student and knew her well. She supplied me with young, wretched creatures who had found their way into her establishment, but who redeemed themselves by becoming my puppets. But my technology wasn't what it is today. Isn't that so, Frederick? It was simple, even crude. In one of my experiments, I applied Acadamission Pavlov's Theory of conditioned reflexes to sexual behavior. In my view, Freud had failed. I succeeded in controlling human desire, but there was still a missing link. My subjects could not yet fulfill the desires I had created in them. they were not a very pretty sight after the operation. Bastard! Cow's brains, torn from their mother's womb before they were born. Virgin brains, never had a thought in their life. One day, a hunting man had the impertinence to enter my fortress. The fool didn't understand what he saw. And in his confused ignorance, he set my zoo on fire. I tried desperately to put out the fire, but I only just managed to escape with the injuries that I sustain to this day. Unfortunately not so attractive to women. The hunter was still less fortunate. He was found the next day, among the ashes of my laboratory, charred and impaled on a still smoldering stake. Shish kabob. Now, tell me, how did you manage to drug the guards and get out of your cell? No! No! No! Take the girl and prepare her. I'll operate tonight. No, no, Jason help me! Help me! And get these two out of my sight. What are we gonna do now, man? He's already got Millie, now he's gonna get Judy. Not if I can help it. Yeah and how do you think you're gonna be able to help it? I don't know, but there must be a way out of here somehow. A lot of use you were. Anyway, how'd you get yourself into this mess? Me? I was born into it. My mother, she was shipped to Dr. Storm by Hairy's, like freight from Hamburg, like little lambs to the slaughter, only they didn't know she was pregnant and I was born later. After Dr. Storm operated on her, they kept me and I've been their whipping dog ever since. You're sick, you're ill, you're insane! Can't possibly get away with this forever. That creature you've got hidden away will turn on you one of these days! Tomorrow, none of these considerations will have any meaning for you. No, no! This will calm you down. No! No! Make sure you guard her well this time. There've been too many mistakes for one day. Well my friends, there'll be three more companions for you very soon. Hey man, come here. Look at this. Look at this window here. There's a ledge outside that runs to the window by the hall. Yeah, sure man and who the hell's gonna climb through that? It's not even large enough for a kid to get through. Well Frederick, it looks as though you're gonna be a hero after all. - What? What are you talking about? Very simple, you see. All you've got to do is climb onto Abraham's shoulders, climb through the window, crawl along the ledge, enter the window by the hallway, knock out the guard and open the door from the outside. Oh no, no, I won't do it! I won't do it. No! I won't do it! I absolutely refuse! No, I won't do it! No! Well, it's either that or having you head sliced off too. Well, all right then. All right. Here you are, take this, you'll need it. Oh, I was almost the hero, wasn't I? You sure were, man. Wasn't he, Abraham? Sure you were, man. We'll fix you up. No, there isn't time. It's Dr. Storm. What about him? You don't know the whole story. Dr. Storm is Judy, we've got to help Judy. That'll teach him not to wear his crash helmet. - Judy, Judy, come out. Come out of it, Judy. Come on. Judy! Come on, wake up. Judy, come on. come on. Jason. They gave me some kind of injection. - Doesn't matter, doesn't matter, come on. We'll pull you out of it. But he was going to operate on me. He's insane. I'll say he's insane, these zombies, these ridiculous machines and where's Millie? Come on. Let's get to the quick! It's Aunt Harris. Come on, there's nothing we can do for her. Jesus. Dr. Storm! - Millie! Millie. Oh Millie. Oh, there he goes! Leave Millie, come on! Abraham, come on, you must go! Quick! Jason! Jason! Shit! All right. Quick, the guards, around the back. For Christ's sake, man, the place is going up like a haystack! Abraham, you drive! There he is! Get after the son-of-a-bitch! Okay kids, hold on. Right Abraham, drive at him and then past him. What do you mean? Just do as I say. We're going to give him some of his own medicine. Your tickets, please. It's all right, it's only me. Really Jason, you are the limit. Don't be so silly. And you cheer up, eh? Don't you think you should have given that to the police? Man, it's such a fantastic story, they'd never believe it.
