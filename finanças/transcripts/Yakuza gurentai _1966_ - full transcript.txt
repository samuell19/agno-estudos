Kinkakuji Temple. Anyone? We have a special fare here. Regular taxis charge 55 to 85 cents. Really. Yes, thank you. To Kawara Town. Kawara Town. Kawara Town. It's a shared ride, you know, but we keep the fare low. Kawara Town. How much? - It's 15 cents. - That's cheap. - Wanna go? - Let's go. - Hey, what's up? - Need one more. Okay, hold on. - Hold on. - Okay. Hey, you wanna go to Kawara Town? How much? Fifteen cents. Okay, thanks. - Hurry. - Okay, this way. Okay, off you go. Yes, please, get in. - Kawara Town. - Yes. All clear. Thank you. - That was so-so. - Not bad. That's a third for each of us. That's a decent amount. Ah, you're the ones. What're you doing? Soliciting rides with unlicensed cabs?! Huh? We dunno what yer talkin' about. I dunno. We've got the evidence. Punks like you are a disgrace to Kyoto. What're you talkin' about? What? Come with me! Kawara Town. Shit! That business is gone now. And to think they make a living on our taxes. - Do you pay taxes? - No, I don't I'm gonna smash your head in! - Be careful! - Sony. He suddenly ran out there. Hey! How about this, bro? Let's fake accidents. Not with people, but car-on-car. Do like this... Get rear-ended, then we can get money. Men, who are driving women, are always gazing to the side. Sounds like a good idea. Go ahead and do some research on that. Okay, I will. Do you have anything smaller? Oh? Well, I'll go break this then come back. Sorry. Thank you. Damn those ride-stealers! That counterfeit bill sure is useful. - Yes, it is. - Thank you. I'm hungry. How about some takoyaki? Okay. Do your thing. 15-cent's worth, right? Here... Thank you. - Um, can I...? - Huh? I haven't gotten my takoyaki yet. I just gave it to... - Who was that guy? - Who...? Whatever. Just stop talking. - Gimme my money back. - I'm sony, but... - Now! - Uh... Welcome. Brother! Aren't you Brother Sugiyama? I'm Jiro. Jiro Taniguchi. - Oh, you're Jiro? - Yes. When did you get back? - I just got back. - Is that so. If you like, please come over to our place. We can help you out. - Let us do that. - It's none of your business. Hey, let's go take a walk. Yo. Who was that, bro? After retuming from kamikaze duty, he started a hoodlum gang with this store's owner. It's been 14, 15 years. He killed a Chinese guy, and was thrown in jail. Oh, he's back from jail. That's why he looks so tough. That's when I was selling grilled squid legs. Back in those days, the black market was fun. Brother was selling dried squid legs. - Uncle, here you go. - Thanks. Come, come see a dancing cat. No tricks here. This cat was raised far away in New York in America. This cat is one of a kind. Hey! Take this! Yo, what's wrong with you? What's he up to? Kurokawa? He's a yakuza now. He's moving up in the Ojo Clan. Why? No, I was remembering. Didn't the three of us toast to our careers? The most successful one becomes our leader. - You're the one. - What's this talk, now. I'm making an honest living now. For now, relax at my place until you find a job. I didn't tell you, but Yumi and I are together. Welcome back. Nice. You found a good one for us. T hear he failed the college boards. Seems like he wants to go to college. Sounds stupid. Yeah, but why are you looking for a guy? I could understand looking for a woman. If these guys want to attract a woman, they need money. A good-lookin' guy like him doesn't need money. He'll bring women in. And make us money. Well, go bring him over here. Okay. Can I get some juice? You flashiness sure pisses me off! We're hoodlums. Just take a seat. Whaddya think about becoming one of us? You're a hoodlum, right? I'm going to a prep school. If you frequent these places, you won't get into college. I don't even want to go to college. My old man keeps pushing me to go. But I know that I'm not smart enough to get in. Your old man didn't go to college, right? It's okay. It's okay. Going to college is meaningless. Breaking bad is normal nowadays. That's how the world is, so we should be thankful. Even if you work your butt off, nobody cares. Imagine if there were no hoodlums. It'd be crazy out there! No matter how much we strive, we'll never become bosses. It's like it was when there were kings. If you're not bom into the king's family... too bad. In contrast, we hoodlums are democratic. Unlike yakuza, we don't have a boss. The money we make is only for our use. And we split it evenly among the members. That's real democracy. Why don't you go ahead and take a bath? Why don't you go first? Sugi. You go. Let's go take a bath, Daddy. Yeah? Okay. In that case, we'll go first. Keep his sake cup full. Sugi, I intended to wait for you to return. But... a woman just cannot live on her own. So you got together with him in order to have a life? Well, that's okay. I'm happy now. I do not want anyone to destroy my present life. SUGI / YUMI The world has changed while you were away. Things have calmed down. What're you doing?! Sugi. Daddy. Daddy. Get a life, man. - Need a ride? - Huh? I'll give you a good discount. We call one's head "peten”. The eyes are "gan". The fingers are "enko”. The stomach is "mosa”. When you're hungry, you say "mosa-goke”. Men are "toko-suke”. Women are "nao-suke”. Women are also called "suke”. Another's wife is "ba-shita”, it's a samurai word. It means “under the horse”. Anice-looking woman is called "hakui-suke". Ahome is called "yasa” or "kantan-bachi". The police are called "red place”. "He's ared" means “he's a police spy”... so we have to really be careful about them! “Police” is "deko-chin”. Deko-chin is the swom enemy of us and the communists. If you see deko-chin, you'd better run, because the Japanese Deko-chin Organization is quite strong. And what's more, Japanese prosecutors find ways to make arrests stick. In England, prosecutors need three years' experience as lawyers. Japanese prosecutors become lawyers to atone for the sins. - That's a big difference. - Let's smash their heads in. And then, there's the "jingi”. The "jingi” is the formal greeting that we must do among us hoodlums... who we call "nana-no-mon”. - Show him how. - Yes, here goes. Do-ron! Do-ron, Brother! It's Ken. "Do-ron” is a ride-stealer. Do-ron! Do-ron, Brother! You damn... What's up? Brother, it's you, isn't it. Yeah. Oh, it's you. Where's Brother Motomura? Well... We've parted ways. So let me stay at your place. Okay. As a new person, I'd like to formally introduce myself. Please allow me to introduce myself. I thank you for listening. Please pardon me for greeting you outside like a huckster. I am from the Kansai region. Kansai, speaking of Kansai, it's a rather large area. Kansai is Osaka south of Yodo River, near Osaka Castle. Ken. Hey. Your car? It's a rental. It costs $1.40 per day. - Nice car. - Nah, it's not. It's a clunker. If I had my own car, I'd make a lot more. - Hey, Sugi. - Yeah? You were a soldier, weren't you? Yeah, a pilot. So you fought against my father, didn't you? I didn't go to war. We lost before I could fly. Yeah, but you were a soldier, right? Yeah. So maybe you met my father somewhere. No way I would have met him. Where's everybody? They went to work. Things are tough in this recession. - Yes. - I'm from "Road to Growth”. Please allow me to clean the room. It's been cleaned already. Per Road to Growth, if I don't clean it, I'll lose my way. - Oh. - Yes. So just let me go through the motions. Excuse me. Who's that? He says he's from Road to Growth. - Well, serve him some tea. - Yes. - How about some tea? - Yes, thanks. How are you doing? No, it's over for me. It sure isn't any fun being a patient. I suffered chest pains and was bedridden for a whole year. Where does it hurt? - It hurts everywhere. - Everywhere? Oh, that's not good. - Here. - Thanks. On top of that, we're ina recession, you know. You need high status to be in a room like this, though. No, I got it. Please. Oh, welcome. Howzit goin'? Maybe you should check out. I don't know what's wrong with you. Either way, be sure that you settle up by the due date. All right, then. - Bro. - Hey, you came. - Not gettin' much, huh. - Yeah. - I'll get you some balls. - Huwuh? - Try shooting now. - Ah, okay. - Hey, they're comin' out! - Like I said. Man, you really got some connections, don't you. Yo, winning big time, aren't you. Thanks to you. - Lemme borrow these. - Sure, go ahead. - Who's that? - Yakuza. Since it's their territory, it pays to get along with them. Hey... when are you gonna bring some girls by? I know. I'll do it soon. One of the new girls tells me, "I'm getting married, so I'm gonna have to quit”. Just like that. No "thank you", or anything. Hey, you! Again! We're in a recession, you know. Ah, maybe I'll find a good man and get married, too. This isn't lighting. Hey, why don't we start a family soon? - As long as we're doin' this. - Can't. I don't wanna be a kept man. How about this... If you want me to go, I'll go. But, there's the issue of separation money. I don't need it. No, stupid, money for me. Yeah, 600 bucks is fine. - I'll leave you for that. - You're crazy. A call for Mr. Taniguchi! Okay, thanks. Is this you, bro? I found a good way to make money. Come soon. It's the leader of the company going bankrupt in Nishijin. Okay. I'll be waiting at Higashi-yama Hospital. So, whaddya think I should do? The best thing to do would be to write an I.0.U to us. If it's 3,000 dollars, that's okay. It's better if you write a long-ago date on it. We'll join the creditors' meeting using that. And then? We'll hold your security note of just 3,000 dollars. 6K to 9K... whatever. It all depends on how good we are. You can keep at least that much, don't you think? But I wonder if it'll work. Just leave it to us. Here, bro. Okay. If it goes well, we'll split it 70-30. That's fine. So you'll come to the meeting, too, right? I'd like to, but I have yet to pay any of this hospital bill. No, no. Since you aren't sick, you don't have to pay. - Right? - Yeah. It don't matter. You can just run outta here. Strike while the iron's hot. You should leave now. Let's get ready. The patient in 305 is... 305? What's wrong with Nishikawa? - Says he want to check out. - Huh? Good moming. - Who are you? - Relatives of Nishikawa"s. Yes, these guys... It's them. You can't just do whatever you want. Now Mr. Nishikawa... - The hospital charges, right? - They have to be paid. - Can't do it. - Huh? - Just like the Tenri religion. - Tenri religion? Pa-a-ay it. Pa-a-ay it. Nishikawa sold all his assets to pay his debts. How about I leave HIM as a hostage instead. Thank you for your cooperation With this beautiful woman, I could stay here forever. What're you doing? - Get outta here! - Thanks much. Hey! Over here. Yo. How'd it go? I'll take care of it. There'll be no problems. I'll definitely ask for your help tomorrow. I'll write you out an I.0.U for ten grand. Yeah. Maybe I'll have you come pick it up tonight. I want to ask your advice about some things, too. Here's the address. It's my mistress's place. So, I definitely request your services. Go. What a greedy old man! He must have more money at his mistress's place. This thing is not a 70-30 split. Should be 50-50. If he pays three thousand out of the nine, we'll get 1,500 dollars. That's 1,500 dollars, bro! We'll finally be able to party like crazy! We'll get some broads and go take an airplane trip. I totally couldn't tell that in the theatre. I can't believe you're married. Yeah, it was dark. It's nice being a student, isn't it. Working is no fun. You do the same thing every single day. I shouldn't have gotten married. - Maybe you should end it? - Huh? Just break up with your husband. If I could only find someone better. Hey, gimme a highball. What? Take a picture, it lasts longer. Yo, honey, how about saying something? Will you please stop? Who the hell are you? Isn't this interesting. You tryin' to pick a fight? - You're the one picking a fight. = Stop it. Outta my way. Stop it. Stop it. - Are you hurt? - It's nothing. I'm sorry. It wasn't your fault. But... Nobuko. So, you have to be going now, don't you? I'm fine. My husband's on a business trip. Hey. Why don't you come to my place next time. Any aftemoon is okay. Just give me a call. Say yes. Oh! - Is he here? - C'mon in, What's wrong? Didn't I say to call first. What about school? You don't need to study? - I need some money. - Huh? I'm being blackmailed by that hoodlum from the other day. I may be killed. Dear. My dear. It was for you, so it doesn't matter what happens to me. Why don't you tell the police? - Then our secret will be out. - No, we can't... How much money do they want? - 300 dollars. - What?! No... It wasn't only my fault. It was you, too. So, can't we do something? Do something. I was just... Before yesterday, I had never even heard of this creditor. So you're saying that we're not creditors? What're you talkin' about. Look at this I.0.U. It's for 10,000 dollars, man. Ten grand. If that's 10,000, then what happens to our shares? No matter what you say, my only asset is this house. Oooh, yeah. You all have to discuss this among yourselves, Okay, then. If we rattle on like this, we'll never get started. - Let's go get our share. - Let's do it. No need to be in such a huny, Mr. Taniguchi. Hello, Mr. Kurokawa. What're you punks doin' here? How about it? Why don't you leave now? What're you talkin' about? We're not doing anything... We know what you're doing. Jiro. I want to settle this matter peacefully. But, you know, this is our job. Yes, so you need to talk to everyone... and see if the amount can be reduced. How about it? Won't you leave now to help me save my honor. Whaddya think? Should we help him out with some money? We got to. Wai-wait... you just wait a minute. This is not what we talked about. Tough shit, you greedy old man. Deal with it! I can't believe this... Thanks. You see how simple the hoodlums are. - We don't need to pay them. - Yeah, you're right. Sugi. Aren't you Sugi? Sugi, right? Oh, Kurokawa. “Although I avoided it with a smile, my soul is excited to accept the fight”. Why so standoffish? When did you get back? You should have contacted me. Maybe things have changed. What's changed? Everything. So, how will you make a living? With hoodlums. What? Aren't you too old to go back to the hoodlums? They're bums. How about joining our gang? You've helped me. T'll tell my boss about you. - I won't join the yakuza. - Why not? Having a boss is against my nature. T hate the idea of a boss. Ah, you haven't changed at all. Bro, need to talk. News is, the cops are at the boss's place! Man, we lost 1,500 dollars. Because of the stupid yakuza. T'll smash their heads in and suck their brains out! - Like this, huh? - Yeah, like that. Just you wait. We'll get some hot broads. We're different from yakuza! 'Cuz we fight with our brains. Let's make quick money by using women. Koichi will bring in more women to make us money. And then we'll all become executives. Ken, you'll be an executive, too. I want my own taxi company. Chicks are better, you moron. - Stop fluttering. - No, take me back! She says she's bored with her husband. Can you all show her some affection? Okay, here we go. No, please take me back. Look. She's back. Let me go! Let me go! What's wrong? Let me go. There's nothing we can do about that. Ken. The same thing happened to my mother... and that's how I was born. T hate it. It's best to forget about that. You're better off if you forget about the past. That's just wrong, isn't it? T hate it. When I was in the slammer, and my nerves were shattered and I couldn't stand it... there was a song that I sang. You mind if I sing it? "Real men, real men don't have lingering attachments to dreams of the past. Digging up the past leaves you naked. Have the courage to push it away If you're a man, you can... We're hoodlums. It doesn't means that you can do anything. You just pass women around then sell them off. The only thing you know is bullying weak people. We were bullied ourselves, so we're getting even. That's right! Dealing with women is one of our jobs. There are many other ways to make money. Really. If you find one, tell us about it. We used to do things like sell grilled squid legs and... bag toads and put them in a square pot. Oh, yeah. Can't you make money by swiping rice or clothing? Bro... What? Times are different now. Food and clothing are plentiful. Even so, aren't you hoodlums cuz you can't make a living? That sounds stupid. So what's your reason? Cuz this world sucks. It's fine to just keep on fooling women. - What?! - Bro. - It's not a time to yell. - That's right. Brother Sugi, what you're saying sounds pretty cool, but who is it that you're living off these days? Isn't it from the money that we've earned? The hoodlum with no job, is you, Sugi, isn't it? Bro, don't get mad about hopeless things. Let's enjoy ourselves. An electric refrigerator has a 5-year guarantee... but we humans don't even have a guarantee until tomorrow. What're you laughin' about? - He's lost it. - Totally. That's what happens after 15 years in a dark place. - Anyway get us more broads. - Okay. Don't bring married women. 'Cuz they're gloomy. - Younger is better. - I was thinking... girls in dorms would be good. They just go from dorm to work and back... and don't have any stimulation, right. - They're starved for affection. - They'd be starving. - I'm short on funds. - Ah, funds. Use whatever funds you need. If we get a lot of women, we build a big prostitution ring. And not just in Kyoto. We open branches in Tokyo and Osaka. Jiro is president, and Okera and I are branch managers. What're you doin'? This one. It's chock full of rolls of cloth. We take the car with it. No way. In broad daylight? If we get chased, we're done for. Brother, forget it. - Let's find another way. - Huh? That one. It's a'64 Cedric. Same color as that. Let's go find that car. It should still be there. There it is. Do as I told you, okay. If you're careless, you'll be arrested. Yes, I know that. This is really pretty. We'll hide half of it, and take only half to the house. Why do that? To save. Save money to buy your own car. - And use it for work. - Okay. This is great. How much can we get for it? For something like that, between 30 and 60 dollars. That's the Sugi we know! So? Can you all sell these for us? Yeah, let's go sell these like crazy. Oh. C'mon in. - This is you! Keep it. - Okay. - This one's better. - Yeah. What about your job? I quit working at those pachinko-like places. She says she wants to work with us. I'll work with you. So, pay me a lot, okay? Welcome. - One? - Yeah. Can you get Nobuko, please. You don't have a proper kimono for work, right? That's okay. Take this. I can't pay for it, so... I'll go out with you tonight. Seems Sugi is spending lots of time at Nobuko's place. That's good because we should rope her in, too. That's perfect. They're both middle-aged. That's why. He's like our dads' age, and he's sleeping with our hand-me-down. In that case, Toki, introduce us to your group of friends. You can't do it all by yourself. If we get a good john, you'll lose him. They're all country girls who just can't make decisions. No decisions needed... Just bring them here. Right. - Yeah. - Just do it! Make money. After our business thrives, bring us a bamboo branch! T understand. T have a nice "gin-vir". - What's a "gin-vir"? - Virgin. He's not worthy of a virgin. Tell me what he does, then let's choose a girl. - Tax Office. - Tax Office? He took his wife's name, so she's always teasing him. Besides, since he was never promoted, he's strict about collecting taxes from citizens. What a scumbag. - He's not worthy of a virgin. - You said it. Okay, I understand. Please let me take care of it. I'll do it so that you won't have to pay taxes. Oh, yeah. And don't tell him that I ordered her. 'Cuz he'll get angry if he's not popular with the girls. I got it. So, how about more beer. This man must have Toki pour his beer. Ahh, you have a beauty spot. Here, Toki. Please enjoy. - Drink more. - Alrighty. - You middle-aged man. - Yes, middle-aged, but... - Here, please. - You can drink, too. This man is high up in the Tax Office. And I'm still young! How about it? Wanna be with me tonight? Yes, but I'm afraid of your wife. T'll just get rid of her. He took his wife's name, so Toki knows how to handle him. Because I educated her well. How about you doing it? With your attitude, you wouldn't make good money. Thanks. Let's go splash around in the tub. - Excuse us. - What is this?! This camera takes good photos. You want us to smash your brains? There's nothing you can do. You got caught in a trap. Don't do anything rash now. We're not going to take any money from you... because we're honest. The best thing you could do is to lower taxes as much as possible. And you should lower our taxes, too. Sounds good, right? - Gimme the film! - Stop runnin' around. I'm not bad. It's not me. It's not me. Eat and drink like crazy. - We have tons of money. - Okay. We come here all the time. Because we make the big money, you see. This is much funnier than working, isn't it? Yeah, this is fun. All our company guys are real cheapskates. Yeah, 'cuz they're all salaried workers. Yeah, so being self-employed, we have no money problems. We can buy you whatever you want. Okay, will you buy me a diamond ring? A diamond ring? Sure, yeah, Boss. That kind of stuff is cheap. By the way, you're staying the night, aren't you? Okera, get us a room. Yes. We're leaving now. Let's break away from those guys. You know, I was thinking about it... We don't need to work so hard for them. You and I can make money on our own. We can get finer rich guys and take them for everything. They're middle-aged. So they quickly go crazy over women. How about just the two of us work together? Yes. I'll do whatever you wanna do. They're a bunch of idiots! Even though they think they're the smartest, none of them can go it alone. We're different. Yes, we're different. But please don't leave me. I'll do anything. Hey. Sorry to disturb your fun, but can I have a word with you? Just for a minute, okay? I heard that you've trained Toki well. You know that that place is our territory. So? Answer me! Well, we can overlook that depending on your attitude. You couldn't help joining the hoodlums, could you? Why don't you join our "family". You do realize the difference between hoodlums and us? Brother has confidence in your talent. More and more bars are ordering our broads. How about it? Well, I'm not saying you must answer right away. - Uh... - What? About the pay, about how much can I get? What?! - What's wrong? - Huh? You're strange. Bro, you have a visitor. Oh, is that you, Yokota? It's been a while, Brother. What's up? I've got information on a huge opportunity to sell to you. Okay, tell me about it. This guy was in jail with me. So what is it? Nitto Pharmaceuticals is coming out with a new heart disease drug. - What's the name of it? - Auto-Lock. I've heard of it. They're doing a lot of ads now. They're moving its substance from Kobe to Shizuoka soon. Substance? Its active ingredient. It's imported from China. So you're talking about stealing it? But that'll be dangerous. If they tell the cops, we can't sell it. However, the cops won't find out. If the cops find out, they can't sell it next month. Rather, we make it so they can't sell it on time. How about it? You did help me in jail. So I'll give you a special price of 200 dollars. If you plan to buy the info, we'll talk in more detail. Even a low estimate is 25,000 dollars. If it goes well, it'll be 35,000. 35 grand! If you take 35 grand... That's six grand each. - I'll do it, man! - Me, too, of course. I'm not gonna do it. Why not? It sounds too good. You don't trust what Sugi is saying? Well, that doesn't matter. We should just exclude him. The truck leaves Kobe at three tomorrow morning, and passes here at dawn. Okay, it's gonna be a one-shot deal, got it. So, you all get some good shut-eye tonight. Here it comes! Ken! It's here! The signal. Give 'em the signal, quick. Here they are. Let's go. Wait till they carelessly take their eyes off the road. Okay. Get ready to do it. All right. Keep an eye on it. Okay, now! Hey, whaddya doin?! Be careful! You idiot! Why'd you suddenly hit the brakes! Be careful! Whaddya talkin' about! Adog ran right out in front of us! You were the ones who were negligent. A dog? We didn't see no dog! - Right? - Yeah. Didn't see it. You think this settles everything? Huh? It looks good, man. No doubt that it's the substance. All right. Let's settle this calmly. C'mon. C'mon, I said. Yo, get out. Hey, hurry up! We're thinking we want to settle this quietly. But if you start making a fuss, we'll go to the authorities. Um, he's got a family member in the hospital. So please, somehow, don't make this a police matter. Well, isn't that another convenient story. So, if your relative is sick, you can't go to the police? No, that's... We have money for repairs. So can't you... What, you think you can settle this with just repair costs? Don't mess with us! - So, about how much? - How much what? I mean, about how much can we agree on? Okay then. How much, Brother? Hmm, 300 dollars. - What! 300 dollars? - 300! Didn't you said you had a relative in the hospital. Yes. That must be tough, man. How about it, bro? Wanna forgive him because of this? Okay, so how about buying us a meal? Even just a tasty meal, and we'll forget about this. So even this cafeteria would be okay? Yeah. Buy us some food and we'll call it even. - Huh. - Okay. - Okay, let's go. - Yes, thank you. Huh? The substance was stolen? Yes, according to the factory's communication. Where was it done? While in transport, between Kobe and the factory. Damn it! - Acall for Manager Mukai. - Okay. I'll transfer it over here. Hello, Mukai speaking. I'd like you to buy the Auto-Lock substance. - And you are? - I can't say. Are you gonna buy it or not? If you don't want it, I'll offer it to Fujiwara Pharmacy. They'll be happy with that, yeah? If the cops find out about it, we'll throw it all in a ditch. Then you won't be able to sell it from next month. You idiots! Hurry up and go give them the money! Did we not advertise to start selling it next month?! Our company's trustworthiness is our number one priority! Go do it now! Hey! Absolutely do not let the cops get wind of this. Yo, you understand? Okay... tomorrow, for sure, right? Well, we'll be waiting. Yes, that's fine. The manager Mukai will come to Kyoto tomorrow. He's taking the 10:32 Shinkansen from Shizuoka. So, how much are we talkin' about? Thirty grand, man. And it's in cash! Thirty grand... That's six grand each! That's right! I can buy a new car. If you get a new car, you'll be a chick magnet! Good job, Brother! We did it! We did it! Bro. There's one grand here. Ken and I have saved it up. After this, let's make this six grand each. I don't need to be a hoodlum if I just have money. But maybe you don't want a woman like me... Nonsense! I'm talking as a man who just got out of jail. I can't ask you in the proper way. However, if we're gonna leave, it's now or never. - Hey. - What? What is it? Do you want to make a family with me? Huh? We'll go to Tokyo. We'll go with Ken to search for an honest living. Brother. Brother. - What wrong? - It's the yakuza. - Again they're... - What'd they say? Well, I don't want to waste time with long explanations. The point is whether or not you'll give us the stuff. But this has nothing to do with you all. That's right. We made the plan and we took the risk. You've been saying that. We come here with full understanding of that. You all are but bit players in the yakuza world. Do you not understand that we must bail our boss out? Brother. Kurokawa. This sure is convenient for you, isn't it? Too convenient, you think? What'd you say? - I'm being pompous. - Of course you are. - Sugi. - What? We want money for the sake of our boss. I think you fully realize that... They'll readily give up their lives for our boss. So what about it? If you refuse, we'll take it by force. So, we'll let you think it over. We'll be waiting outside. Let's kill 'em! Nuthin' we can do about it. Whaddya mean? - We can't fight them. - But you know... Because we're hoodlums. Those guys are yakuza who have a boss. If we fight, who the hell are we fighting for? Aren't we fighting for ourselves? For ourselves? - Yeah, this isn't gonna work. - Whaddya mean? You wanna have your arm broken for six grand? Think about the hospital bills. If things go bad and we lose our lives... No, I can't do it. I'm out. If Sanbo says that, then it's a no-go. How about you, Jiro? - We're democratic. - Whaddya sayin'? If everyone says "no", then there's no value in my going it alone. How about you, Koichi? I wasn't in this from the start. Nobody wants it? Nobody wants 6,000? Ido. But I'm saying I'd hate to get tangled up with the yakuza. Right? After all, Japan got into an unwinnable war, and lost. Isn't fighting an unwinnable war a stupid thing to do? We can look for another way to make money again. Yeah, so go ahead and donate money to the yakuza again! What! I'm gonna do it. Brother! If Sugi does it, we'll be targeted, too! Yeah, we'll be targeted, too. We hoodlums are democratic, man. We decide important things together. We'll have problems if you go it alone. You don't get to decide our democratic intentions. That's right, isn't it? - What's up? - Sugi's just being an idiot. - The others have given up. - Sugiyama. He can't do anything by himself. Hey, just keep an eye on Sugi, okay. Yes. Brother. Brother. Ken. - Go bring the car. - Huh? Just go get the car! Hey. Hey. We can't fit so many in. Cram as many in as you can. Brother. Ken, run away! It's all right. Just run. Shut up, and give it to us. T'll overlook this for this one time only. Sugi, you seem to be losing it. I was planning on settling this quietly. Shit! Let it go. Brother! He's an idiot, a real idiot. If he dies, it's a total loss. Yeah, buy why did he push to do that job? He had to know. It'd be taken by the yakuza. That's why he's a stupid idiot! He did it so he could have a family with me. What's so funny? So did you want that, too? - Impossible though it was. - You said it. He hates the idea of a family, so that's why he's a hoodlum. - Yeah? - Well, I wonder. You should just forget about that damn guy. Even remembering him is a waste of time. Yeah, like that. Drink more. Oh, welcome. Let's take care of the stuff, as promised. Go ahead. It's got nothing to do with us. Well, that is true. But make sure you at least give us compensation. We're the ones who want compensation... Because, you see, we were treated terribly by Sugi. We have nothing to do with Sugi. That's right. Even though we said we won't do it, Sugi did it on his own. Our compensation is eared compensation. I can't do that. 'Cuz one of our young members was injured. - Brother. - Oh. It's decided that this guy is now part of our clan. So go ahead and settle with them. Let us take that broad, too. What're you talkin' about? I hear that she's Koichi's girl. You all get together later and calmly settle this matter. - Okay, let's go. - Let's. What're you gonna do? Ain't nothing we can do. Nobuko, how about you? I'll go anywhere. It's okay if I go, yeah? No! Let me go! You creepy maggots! All you guys can do is bully weak people. Lemme go! Get a hold of yourself! This sucks. She's totally smashed. What'd you say? Nothing. Just nothing. You get back to your room now and go to sleep. Sugi is waiting for me. It's Ken. Nobuko. Ken. That guy is impotent! He's not a man! He does what anyone tells him to do! He's not human. You maggot! Only you and Sugi are different! Go to hell! You maggots! Creeps! Impotent. Oh, that woman. She's really on a roll. I'm not impotent. I'm aman. I'm human. Right? We're human beings, aren't we? - Brother. - We'll fight the yakuza. - Oh, come on. - We ain't gonna win. - We ain't gonna beat them. - That's not decided. We can beat them! But we can't go at them directly. No, not that... We beat them using our brains. So we steal the money they take. Brother. If we retreat like this... we're forever gonna be beaten by the yakuza. We're always gonna be the victims. That's true, but... Let's become rich. It's for our own sake, man. Even if you wait, the world ain't gonna change. Let's do it ourselves. Yeah, but... what are we gonna do? That's... from now. How 'bout it? Let's get some money. Let's try to do it in one big swoop. How about it? Huh? Whaddya think? Ken. Thad... a favor to ask. That's why I waited for you. I want you to leave here. I want you to use this money for that purpose. Sugi thought that the three of us... could leave here, and so that's why he did what he did. I knew that. But where can we go? It'll be the same wherever we go. Yeah, wherever we go, there won't be an easy job. But it's not about the job. It's the feeling of it. It's about changing our feelings. It doesn't matter even if I change my feelings. You're the same. You're the same as them, too. You're the same. I can take care of you. I would. Ken. Even without your help, I'll be just fine. Women depend on people easily. T'll go with you, Ken. As long as it's the same everywhere, I'll go. Because I'm human. As long as we're alive, I think we have to keep on searching for something. - Okay. - All right. - Okay, do it. - Oh, thank you. This is real, isn't it? Okay, thank you. What? Half?! If you succeed, I'll give you the other half. They're probably making a deal now. That has nothing to do with us. You have cash, as promised, right? Yes, 30 thousand. They're late. Pull out, now! You stupid idiots, get outta the way! What're you doin'? - What's the problem? - Please give me a push. You idiot, I'm not pushin' this poop truck. I can't do anything. It won't move. Engine trouble. Shaddup! - Move it quickly. - But it's a poop truck! - Just go push it! - Yes. - Hey. - Okay. Yo, you all push, too. Push it quickly. Thank you so much. Quickly. This really, really, really stinks. Okay, here we go. C'mon, you. Today is the day that we challenge you. When we do things, we do things. Take it now! We don't prey on weak people. We use this. This is our compensation. Get in, quick! Brother, they're here. Shit. Damn it! Hurry up... c'mon back! Get in the car! Those stupid idiots. We're almost there, bro. They're still following us, Brother. Brother, can't you go faster? Floor it, Brother! They're coming, Brother. Oh no, the road's ending, Brother. Brother, Brother! Brother. You did it, Brother! Our car! Where's the money? - It's in the car! - Huh? Brother! - Money! - The money! - We can't let it burn. - The money! Money, the money. I'm gonna smash your head in! I wonder if there are any good jobs. No, there aren't. It's really hard to make a living in this world. What's the government doing? If I were prime minister, I'd go after rich people. Don't be pretentious. For now, things aren't good. We'd better keep sticking to the edges of society. Can you give me a light? Here. That's fine. Thanks. How about a puff, Brother. THE END
