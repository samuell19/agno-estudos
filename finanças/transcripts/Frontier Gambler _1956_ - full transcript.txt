Frontier Gambler 1956 It's at the Princess's house. Let's go guys. Princess, are you there? Get water, quickly. Princess, are you in there? Throw more water out the window. Get more water. It's the Princess. She's all burned out. - Excuse. - Yes. - The woman who was murdered. - The princess? - Do you know where she lived? - Yes, right there. In place with fire marks at the entrance. Thanks. Looking for someone? I'm here because of the murder. Did the deputy come with you? A rattlesnake stung your leg yesterday. He sent me in your place. I'm your helper, Curt Darrow. It seems to me that you are a little inexperienced. I only asked for help because I found it, that the Princess's case was too big for me. - Princess? - Yes. Sylvia Melbourne. It was her name. But she ran this city like a princess. I will try to do the best for you, Lord... Dewey. Officer Philo Dewey. - What's your name again? - Darrow. Darrow? - Some relationship with... - He was my father. Why would they send someone named Darrow to this city? What happened before has nothing to do with me. I should have taken care of this case alone instead of asking for help. Well... he's all yours. Good luck. Give me another beer. - How about serving me here? - I'm sorry. I'm busy with my regular customers, Mr. Darrow. - Darrow? - If you want to eat, you better get it. What about my drink, Mr. Darrow? - What about her? - You knocked her over. The least you can do is pay another. You dropped it. Pay yourself. Really? I'm going to have breakfast now. Without the beer. Yes sir. You have your father's eyes and hair. But the stronger chin. Mind if I sit down? Should? You are good at fighting. For a minute, I thought I would have to duel. I thought he was going to serve. Well, you know these tough guys are cowards at heart. You were going to see me. So I decided to come and see him first. I met your father. My name is Roger Chadwick. Duke. I bet I'm your suspect no. 1. - I don't bet. - I can? - I would have won. - Why did you think that? Professional player instinct. Your father had this for a while. - And he lost. - Don't feel bad about it. For a real player, winning is as exciting as losing. - Do you belong to the top of the list? - Good... The Princess was my protégé. I taught her everything she knew. And she was using it to get me out of business. And, of course, the coroner informed you, that she was not killed by fire. - And by a bullet. - Caliber 32. It turns out that when I carry a gun, which is rare, I prefer a 32. It is smaller. Proceed. Unfortunately, there is a weak link in this fatal chain of circumstances. I loved her. I only had two passions in my life. The letters and the Princess. I was true to both. And we don't kill what we love. The cards can turn against you. A woman can marry someone else. - Who told you? - Nobody told me anything. Of course, someone could. I suppose it is better coming from myself. There were talks of her marrying Tony Burton. Professional gunslinger? I understand that some women are fascinated, by men who can kill easily. - But not Sylvia Melbourne? - Not Sylvia Melborne. It was not like him. Despite what you may hear. I can accept that. A player would not try to manipulate his chances. What you mean? To lie. It would be easy to check your story. To be honest, you will have several answers, depending on who you question. I think I'll talk to Tony Burton. - You should meet him at Lazy M. - This is Merritt's ranch. I heard that Francie believed that Tony could run the ranch, your late husband. Besides that... Yes? Well, they're talking about their relationship. Until Sylvia shows up? I suppose this conclusion is obvious, but it's not mine, it's yours. And give me one more person, with reasons for the death of Sylvia Melbourne? - And am I still at the top of the list? - It is. - One more thing, son. - Yes? I mean, honestly, I liked your father. I suppose I am one of the few men who really understood him. "Among the suspects, it should be mentioned, the owner and editor of this newspaper, Tom McBride. McBride's hatred for the Crown saloon, games house, is well known. Also known, is the fact that the Princess recently bought all the newspaper's debts. In an attempt to silence the only voice, who dared to speak against her. " Tom, did you have to do this? It's the truth, isn't it, Helen? And my newspaper prints the truth. But accusing yourself of murder in your own newspaper? If I hadn't written it, it would have looked much worse, dear. Besides, they would have found that out. Tone. Tom, why did this have to happen? As if we don't have enough problems already. Honestly, honey, I think it was for the best. With Sylvia alive and with all her power, we would have no chance in this city. - But now that she's dead... - Tom... Tom, are you sure that... Tom, you swear you don't... What? You didn't do that. Did? Are you looking for a job for me, or what? I just want some information, Mrs. Merritt. - About the murder? - That's right. So you must be young Darrow. One of the guys said you were in town. Tell me something. Why would they send Darrow's son to this city, to investigate a murder? It's like I told everyone. A snake stung the sheriff. But why is it so important. Who was my father? He is dead. Isn't what I am more important? I rode all morning and I need coffee. Lets go in. It is already difficult for a man to keep his lands here, and for a woman. We don't have the title. Possession is just what we have of the land. So there are prospectors digging holes in the bank, for the cattle to fall and break the leg. Miners are hungry too. - And if a fat cow shows up... - You managed. Well, I needed help. Like Tony Burton's? Like Tony Burton's. But is he just a hired gun for you? What do you mean by that? Do not know. They say in town that he was going to marry Tony. Until he met Sylvia Melbourne. He preferred her to you. I don't care what they told you in town. - So you weren't going to marry him? - Not! Well, that's... I considered it. Tony and I are right for each other. I know him, I understand him and I can accept him for what he is. - And I suppose he knows you? - I'm not a saint. But Tony is not the type to marry one. It was very hard, very difficult, but I did my best to hold that lazy man. You said it was right for Tony. - And Sylvia? - She would have destroyed him. - Like? - Sylvia was a perfectionist. Everything about her, her business, her life, had to be perfect. And if they weren't, she would soon do so. Well, from what I heard about Tony, that would be a difficult task. What are you doing? Writing down what we talked about. Who was thinking of marrying Tony, and that he thought Sylvia... would destroy him. But that seems like a reason for murder. Looks? It's Tony. He's been at the cabin for the past few days. And the nights? We have been fattening 20O heads of cattle for sale. - He was taking care of everything. - Does he know about Sylvia? I don't see how I could. Hello, Francie. Who is he? - A sub delegate. - IT IS? - What's he doing here? - It's about Sylvia. - Sylvia? - Sylvia Melbourne. I'm investigating her murder. The murder of Sylvia? Someone saw her house on fire last night. When he entered, he found Sylvia. Shot in the back. - I understand. - You didn't know about that, did you? Of course, I didn't know. - I was in the cabin for two days. - Can you prove it, I suppose? - Who never left the cabin. - Why would I have to do that? You don't think I killed Sylvia. Why did you love her and wanted to marry her? Yes, we decided that week. And hasn't she changed her mind? Giving me reason to come from the cabin and kill her? No, she hasn't changed her mind. - Me neither. - Well, someone changed. Until I find out who, you two better be around. I will probably have to talk to you again. - Thanks for the coffee, Mrs. Merritt. - It's all right. - Bye. - Bye. He seems certain of himself. Who is this man? Matt Darrow's son. Do not. This gets better and better. - What kind of monster are you? - What? A man tells you that the girl you were going to marry was murdered, and you laugh thinking it was a joke. It's a joke. Bigger than you think. Will they pay $ 20? So, you're a player after all, delegate. Not exactly. Then we go back to the top of the list. - How many? - I want two. One in the middle. I will play with these. Observing the reaction of the main suspect in his natural habitat? - Table. - I bet $ 50. $ 50. Another $ 200. Is this gambling? Strange, but I never manipulated the letters. Not that I don't know the methods... To protect myself from others. Right. Less talk and more action. - I pay the $ 200. - Right. - Flush. - I've lost. Highest card? The ace. Beat a lady. Weird. - Does it always happen? - Year after year. Subconscious influence when giving the cards. - Already lost? - Yes, several times... For Sylvia. This peculiar tendency of the human species is strange. Create what will destroy us. Sylvia Melbourne was my creation. She owed her existence to me. How the monster owed Frankenstein. A man of the law with literary inclinations? Great. However, you are wrong. Why, in this case, the creator came to love the masterpiece he created. Make no mistake, Sylvia Melbourne was a masterpiece. - My. - It must have come from somewhere. From parents. Mom and dad, normal! Yes, it is a tragic story. Tragic? It happened a few years ago. The settlers were arriving at this place. The Cheyennes didn't like that. Normally, the Indians were too methodical to attack caravans. But carts were not so lucky. Right. Get out of there. Come here. It's okay now, dear. You are safe. Tell me, dear How did you hide there? When the Indians arrived, my mother... Mom and Dad! Mom and Dad! That's how I met Sylvia. I found her dirty and scared. A hysterical orphan. She only survived because her mother buried her in a premature grave. When I came back to the city with her, I thought... That this meeting was not by chance. You know, as a player, I believed in predetermination. In my instincts or guesses, if you prefer. That have always been proven true. I wondered what would happen to this orphaned child. There are few ways that a young woman should exist, on this wild frontier. That only the strong survive this. But even then, I noticed something different about Sylvia. In my mind, I excluded everything mundane. So there was only one career left, for a young woman of beauty, talent, charm and taste. Well, I was convinced that fate had brought us together. Would I be the ideal teacher to prepare such a pupil? Sylvia did as well as I expected. Not as a sculptor. Not like the artist, that creates inanimate images of life. My creation, Sylvia Melbourne... it was a living perfection. A living masterpiece. - My dear, you look beautiful. - Why did you do that, Roger? I did? I know you got rid of him. I don't know how or why. Are you talking about young Mortinson? I investigated him and he was not good enough for you. I didn't hurt him. We played some hands... No one is, is it? Except you, maybe. - I'm what? - Good enough for me. Good enough for a poor orphan who got off the ground after an Indian attack. My dear, what you were means nothing. What matters is what you have become. - What I did to you. - That's the problem, Roger. What I have become, what I owe you, what I admit, is almost everything, including my life. You are not my owner. - And it never will be. - My dear, I already... No, you never asked or ordered anything. But whatever you do or say, even the way you look at me, implies that you expect everything. I'm sorry, Sylvia. I've already been compensated for what I've done for you. For the pleasure of watching you become this beautiful young woman. Now that you are, as they say, a grown woman, I just ask you to grant me the pleasure of continuing to admire you. What if I betray that admiration? You couldn't, my dear. You could not betray everything I taught you. Let's forget about Mortinson. It is not worth the disagreement between two old friends. That was our first disagreement. Until that night, his faith in me had been implied. Anything I asked for or suggested, Sylvia accepted without question. - Matt said he wanted to see me. - That's right. Can I do something for you? - I want to play with you. - Play? With me? This is ridiculous! I suppose it is. You must have a reason besides money. You have everything you need. - Money is the reason. - With your percentage at all... But if you're serious, I can give you a loan. I need enough money to open my own place. Can I ask why? I can't go on like this, Roger. Living like a puppet waiting for someone to pull the strings. My dear, you are doing drama. I have to be free, Roger. Otherwise, I will end up hating you. And I don't want that. I owe you a lot. You do not owe me anything. Whatever I gave, it was without waiting for a return. You proposed a game with enough money to open your saloon. Against what? Against myself. I'm afraid I don't understand. If I win, you pay me enough to open a saloon. If I lose, I will belong to you. I will marry you. I'll do whatever I want, from now on. And I swear I will keep my promise. That's enough? Of course, you know who you're up against. I never met anyone who could beat me in the cards. I know. One hand? - How many? - I'll play with these. I want two. I would say that you are in a great position to bet high. But of course you know that. I taught you. - A heart flush to the king. - Excellent hand. Let's see what I have. Fantastic! Full house. In the two cards I chose. So I lost. On here. Good luck with your new saloon. I dont understand. After all these years together, you should. You know I wouldn't collect a bet like that. I love you, of course. And I want you. But only if you want to. I knew that. And I counted on it. Did you count on that? You taught me more than you thought. I could never win it in the cards, but I saw a chance to bluff. And you let me steal the victory. For the first time in my life, I lost. Although it was not in the letters. I found someone who could beat me. My own pupil. And did Sylvia open her own saloon? Spectacularly. Not only for the game, but she invested what she won in several businesses. She had the Midas touch. She was on her way to own the entire valley. No wonder they called her Princess. She got along well with everything except one subject. - What? - Men. Do you think it was a man who killed her? I did not say that. But that would be my guess. I was referring to your personal life. Sylvia threw a birthday party in the saloon... To celebrate your success. Everyone showed up. No thank you. - How are you? - Good. Everything is great, dear. - Do you have enough to eat? - Yes, a lot. That's nice. Excuse. Hi, McBride. Helen, good to see you. - Do you want to drink or eat something? - Thank you but not. Tom, please. I found out today what you did. He bought the newspaper's debts. There is nothing personal about it, Tom. I had no choice. Your editorials would ruin my business. They should be ruined. I am afraid I do not agree with this opinion. And I don't think the newspaper will agree either, after today. We still have a few days. Don't be sensitive, Tom. I don't want to close your newspaper. Closed or not, I will still find a way to stop it, with or without the newspaper. Come on, Helen. I see you've found a way to take care of McBride, the same way you took care of everyone who stood in your way. - Don't be rude, Roger. - I'm not. I am your faithful admirer. Well, my dear, you are a success. It has everything you could want. More even than I dreamed for you. I have something for you, Roger. The money you gave me to open this place. - It's all here. - My dear, I do not want. It was a gift for you. But it's still a call. And I don't like that. No one. Come on, Tony. I want you to meet her. The girl who owns almost everything. And a member of my ranch. Which means she's your boss. The most beautiful boss I've ever had. Sylvia, this is Tony Burton. How are you? - So this is all yours, huh? - Yes it is. It is beautiful too. You know, I was thinking about marrying Francie, but... You make a man stop to think. Burton. Tony Burton. Wasn't he involved in the Winslow shooting? Can be. I remember a dozen. - That's how I survive. - Hired gunman. I didn't like the tone of your voice, sir. This is a party. Let's keep everything friendly, huh? I hired Tony to solve some problems at the ranch, and I think he liked the job and decided to stay. Of course the payment is not bad. So I thought about staying for a while. I'm thirsty, Tony. I think I'll have a drink. - Follow me? - I'm going. I will join you Francie. - Brandy? - Great. Your friend looks confident. - I suppose so. - Is that you? - Does it work on both sides? - No, it doesn't work. I have no illusions about Tony. He is poison to most. But I know that he is good for me. Why do I understand it, and accept him for what he is. He's what I need and want. - So you better hold it fast. - I know. That's how it started. Sylvia never learned, evaluating a man, because I've always been there to protect you from guys like Tony. Tony, not here. Sylvia will know. - When? - I'll meet you outside. After my next presentation. Right. - Who is it? - Roger. Just a minute. In between. Roger, how unexpected. We haven't seen each other much lately. There was no reason to see each other, was there? Wasn't there why? Between two old friends. I will always consider you my best friend. I owe you everything. I had to talk to you, Sylvia. I can't let you do that. My human instincts are very strong in this case. Let me do what? Surrender to an immoral swindler. A wandering garbage. - A professional killer. - Roger, please. Won't you ask what his name is? But of course we know that the description only matches one person. You can go now, Roger. Immediately. When I'm done. Do you know that what you say won't make a difference? Perhaps. I told you I wanted freedom. No connection. Do you know what that means? It means freedom to make my own mistakes. We agree on one thing. Tony Burton is a mistake. Whatever Tony is, and you can be right about him, I love him. - And he loves you. - Devoutly. I am afraid that Mr. Burton's devotion requires a certain qualification and definition. You're talking about Francie, of course. I'm sorry for her... I'm not referring to Francie. The case of our conquering cowboy, which I am referring to is something more recent. I hoped I didn't have to do that. - Maybe you recognize that. - How did you get that? A gift from you to your suitor? Very handsome and generous. You beat Tony, didn't you? I know you very well, Roger. I know your methods. Remember Ted Mortinson? I didn't beat Tony or beat him in any other way. In fact, Tony had nothing to do with it. - So how did you get it? - I bought it for a bargain. - From who? - A maid of mine. A very young and beautiful maid. Maybe I heard you sing. Gloria Starling? But... Gloria swore she was given a gift. And, putting money above sentiment, she agreed to sell me. - I do not believe in you. - Ask her? Or better yet, ask Mr. Burton. I'm going to marry Tony. Despite what you say or do. No, it won't. I will not let. You have no right. You were nothing, when I found you dirty. I raised you. Roger, please! You have no right to lose yourself for someone who is not worth it. A naughty philanderer who pulls the trigger without thinking. You are crazy. You are insane. Am I? Get out of here! So this is the end of all our years together? The aim of a gun? The last thing I want to do is use this, Roger. You know, you were right about my mental condition. I held on to the insane idea... that one day, you would feel the same way I always felt about you. I wish I could love you, Roger. I'm serious. But... But why do I owe you everything, somehow, the things I wanted to feel got stuck... - In gratitude. - So, despite everything... will you still marry Tony? After all. There is nothing you can do to stop me. You know for a lifetime, no matter what letters he had, he accepted it without regret. This is the hand I wish I could play again. Goodbye, Sylvia. This is the last time I saw Sylvia Melbourne alive. Ladies have always been lucky for me. And before the wedding she was killed by someone... unknown? - Do you want to arrest me? - Not yet. The only proof, he told me. I cannot force you to testify against yourself. Of course, you had a reason. Just like several other people. While deciding whether I'm guilty or not, I promise I will not leave the city. What do you propose to do? You said Sylvia had a gun hidden in your room. - She appeared? - She may still be there. Can you? Tom, they are saying in the city, that you didn't attack Sylvia in the newspaper because of your ethics. And it wasn't. It was because he was secretly in love with her. And when I didn't want you, you started the campaign against her. That she was forced to buy her debts to defend herself. Do you believe that? If I did, I would have killed Sylvia myself. Yes? - Do you intend to print this? - Yes, I already did. It will be ready for distribution in the morning. - Burn it. - What? I told you to burn all copies. Why would I do that? Haven't you done enough against that girl without it? I'm sorry, but this story is news. And I always print the news, regardless of who will hurt. You will be hurt if you sell a copy of this newspaper in the city. I kill you! Your... No, Tom. No! Tone! Tone! You murdered my husband. - You murdered him! - I didn't want to kill you, madam. If I hadn't cashed, he would have killed me in the back. Ask these men. They saw. I'm sorry. I have a client for you, cop. So it was him, huh? I should have known. This was not for the murder of the girl. You better keep him here tonight. We will interrogate him in the morning. - The crowd is angry. - Really? He just killed Tom McBride. - In self-defense. - Like everyone who killed, huh? It was either that or being shot in the back. Too bad I couldn't choose. I'm sure the interrogation will clear him. In the meantime, keep it here. Right. Let's go. Get in there. If someone comes looking for me, I'll be at Sylvia Melbourne's house. It's all right. It is better to keep that door locked. Stay still. Don't try to move. Shorty, get his gun. Now, maybe I can explain who it is. And what you do in my house. And how it all happened. - You are Miss. Melbourne? - Of course. - And is she alive? - Is obvious. My name is Curt Darrow, deputy delegate. I was investigating your murder. - My murder? - That's what everyone thought. Last night, a girl your size, wearing her dress, she was shot and killed here. She was identified as you. How is it possible? I can understand now. The fire consumed the body. It was a natural mistake. Who was she? And what was she doing here? - Maybe you can tell me. - What you mean? The girl, whoever she was, was shot by a 32. Shot in the heart. Your weapon is a 32. And it was fired once. Are you suggesting that I... Can you tell me where you've been - in the past 24 hours? Of course I can. I was with Shorty. Him? Yes, he is a gold digger. I've been financing it for years. Yesterday he brought the first sample that looked good, then she insisted that she go with him. Can you confirm that, of course? - Can he speak? - Not. He was captured by the Indians years ago. You know the Indians. I suppose he doesn't know how to read or write. Well, you chose a great witness. - Do you think I need one? - I'm not sure yet. I'll know more when I find out who was murdered here. Wait a minute. Did you say that girl was wearing my dress? That's right. Shorty, hand this over to the Big Strike waiter for me. - This is not mine. - It is not? No. It was in my closet, but it's not mine. - Where's Shorty? - He went to deliver a message for me. Don't you know who it belongs to? Do not. - You're in a bad position. - What you mean? Well, a dead girl in your house, wearing your dress, and you disappear. I found here the revolver of the same caliber as the bullet that killed it with a bullet fired. This is easy to explain. I bought the gun recently, and shot it once to see what it was like. I think you know who the dead girl is and what she did here. This is not true. Who else had the key to this place? No one. It's all right. We will leave it at that for now. - I'm stuck? - Not yet. But don't go panning with Shorty. I got your message, delegate, but... - Are you okay, Roger? - Sylvia? Alive? - But I thought... - I went out with Shorty yesterday. I suppose I should have told you, but who would dream of such a thing... I'm so relieved. - But who was... - Do you recognize that? Yes. It has to be. Glory. Glory? Oh no! Get up, Tony. We need to talk. - And the interrogation? - It was postponed. Sit down! - What is happening? - I can't understand something, Tony. - How did you expect to get away with that? - Get away from what? Murder that girl. You are not making sense. I told you yesterday that I was at the cabin miles away. The mud on your horse's paw that I saw yesterday came from the street outside. - You were in town, yes. - What if I was there for an hour? What proves not to admit that I was? Along with everything else? Quite something. You took Gloria to Sylvia's, didn't you? So you know? That Sylvia is alive and Gloria is dead? Of course. How did you get in, Tony? Sylvia had a key in her office. I knew where I was. How did you know Sylvia would be out? She told me at the cabin when she passed Shorty. So you used that opportunity to find Gloria, without your bride knowing? In her house? - Well, I've heard bad things... - It wasn't like that. Gloria meant nothing to me. When he found out that I was going to marry Sylvia, I didn't want to leave. He threatened to tell everything. So I had to see her to try to convince her not to do that. - At Sylvia's? - Where else? It was where we could be alone. Where no one would think to find us. - So how Sylvia had left. - Did you convince her? - No. - So you killed her? No, I didn't kill her. I didn't even get a chance to talk to her. I gave her the key and she came in alone. When I arrived, she was wearing one of Sylvia's dresses. At this point, I knew it wouldn't work. Why? Gloria hugged me and said she loved me. That he wouldn't leave me. Then we heard someone knock on the door. I didn't know who it was. Someone saw the light on, I think. I couldn't be caught there. So we don't open the door. - What did you do? - I went to Sylvia's room. - Then I heard a shot. - So did you hear? That's right. I waited a while, and when I left the room... I found Gloria dead. The place was already on fire. The bandage on your hand, Tony? I burned when I found Gloria. I knew we would find out who was killed, as soon as Sylvia returned to the city. Why did you let us think that the dead girl was Sylvia? When things happened, I... I was so confused that I didn't know what I was doing. And when I heard about the deception, who thought Sylvia was dead, I didn't expect that. So I didn't know what to do or say. I don't believe it, Tony. Nothing like that. You already had problems. You don't get scared that easy. - Then tell me why I did it. - You were protecting someone. Maybe Sylvia fired. Is more calm? Yes. - Okay, let's talk to Sylvia. - Where? At Lazy M. She slept at Francie. - Francie? - That's right. Let's go. Oh, Duke. In between. Thank you, Francie. - Roger. - We were having coffee. - Want a cup? - No thank you. I'm sorry for having to carry it. Carry it? The sheriff asked to get it. He said he wants to see you in the city. - I brought a carriage. - He must have changed his mind. You better do what he said. That young man knows what he does. I'll get my hat. Did he say why he wanted her? No, he didn't say. The deputy is very silent. Well... I'm ready. - Thanks for the hospitality. - We're still partners. - Bye. - Bye. - See you, Francie. - Bye. Let's go. Hello, Mrs. Merritt. I would like to speak to Sylvia. - Sylvia isn't here. - Is not? I left her here last night. I didn't think she was leaving. She didn't leave until you told me you wanted to see her. I warned? Yes, I'm surprised I didn't see them on the way to the city. - They? - Duke picked her up in a carriage. Said you wanted to talk to her. Duke must be to blame. I think so. Let's go. Wait a minute! - You may need this. - It's all right? Wait! This is not the way to the city. I know. The deputy will find us. But you said that... I couldn't speak in front of Francie. Francie? You're not saying that Francie... - Or does it have something to do with Tony? - We'll find out soon. We can go? Let's go. You said we would find the sheriff. We will. - Where is he? - He'll be here. Did you realize where we are? - The Valley of the Massacre. - Where I found her years ago. There's what's left of the Melbourne family's wagon. And there is the hole your mother used to keep you alive. - I never came back here. - I do, many times. - I always come here. - For what reason? To think, reflect. What do you think my life would be like if I hadn't stopped here years ago? - Well, I don't know... - I always wonder, if it wouldn't be better if I hadn't found you. No, of course not, Roger. Despite what happened between us, I am grateful to have saved my life. Believe me. I took a misshapen piece of clay off the floor, and I molded a beautiful woman. Ironic, isn't it? Being forced to stay, and observe this beautiful creation, getting lost because of a man without feelings. Roger, I was never a misshapen clay. I was a human being. Only he never realized that. You were too busy shaping me. Telling me what to wear, what to read, even what to think. I've been smothered all these years. I understand. The trail goes in that direction. I could only think of how to fight back. How to find an identity that was just mine. That's why I needed my place. Not for the money, but to fight back. - And Tony? - He was part of that. If I hadn't hated him so much and done everything to separate us, I would never look at him twice. Do you think it is possible to go back in time, forget all the years that intervene start over from scratch? Pretend I found you here today? This is impossible, Roger. We are here now, because of those years. Everything that happened to us. We cannot ignore them. So there is no hope for us? I came to the same conclusion two days ago. Two days ago? I didn't know you were out when I knocked on your door... You killed Gloria. You thought it was me. With the light against her, wearing her dress? An allowable error. You brought me here... To make sure I don't make a mistake this time. No, Roger, please. - I'll leave you where I found you. - You are insane. - Goodbye no! Stop! - Are you badly hurt? - I think I broke my ankle. Roger? It's a better way than my dad died. Your father? He was also a player. He killed a man who accused him of cheating and was lynched. I'm sorry. Anyway. Legally or illegally, He would be hanged. It is difficult to carry with you. Try to keep living. It is better to take her to a doctor. I wonder what I will be without him. It will probably be you.
