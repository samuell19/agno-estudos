The Leningrad military district awarded the Lenin Order to the troops and sailors of the Baltic Fleet that took part. Orchestra of the Leningrad Philharmonic directed by Yuri Hatujevich Temirkanov THE LUGA LINE First Film We are writing 1940. The fire of war burned more and more violently in the whole world. The party and government of the Soviet Union, tried to keep the peace in the country, for as long as possible. For a year, half a year, months... Recognising that war inevitable, they tried to arm the Red Army, and provide new technology. It was analysed in military deliberations measures against the enemy, and the results of military exercises. Break through the impenetrable lines of enemy fortifications, destroy a through a devastating blow - not just to the immediate enemy, but also to those from the west they weave aggressive plans against the Soviet Union. Our brave soldiers are unprecedented in the fighting they testified to heroism. Long live the victorious Red Army and the strong navy! Comrades! Maybe we should listen to those who have personally been involved in fighting. - Good idea! - Step forward, Major. Give him the floor. I give the floor to Major Zvjagincev, from the Leningrad Military District. It's you, isn't it? Brave and hero soldiers there were many, that is true. But the enemy has presumably established its main line of defence, destroyed all bridges and roads, thus ensuring a stubborn resistance at this stage. The resistance is only technical and can be broken by supporting conditions. But we were not guaranteed that. It was not! On every metre of our journey, from each ambush snipers fired on fire; for each bridge pillar we had to pay with blood. But we don't complain! No! The war means deprivation and blood! But if complete and appropriate, we would have technical support if you become enough technical and our truly mobile technical units, you... Say, Comrade Zvjagincev... do you think that technical units should provide the technique and the transportation of other sectors of the military. - Did we understand you well? - Yes, Comrade Stalin, exactly. Only in such a case we can provide the rapid progress of combat units, especially tanks and artillery. Modernisation is needed in learning, at work and in the operation of the armed forces, this is the most important task for our commanders. The civil war must end cultic worship of experiences. Action must be taken immediately on the development of new types of weapons. Organise combat training also in the soldiers and the staff, in line with modern warfare requirements. War, comrades, is inevitable. We are believers in peace, but if we have to fight for it, we are not afraid of threats and we are ready to fight against the instigators of war! I sent a message. I wasn't sure to receive. That is all. Yes, but did you just write who you are? They thought you were a general! - Here you go. - Thank you. Is anyone in 525? You have already been moved there, Comrade Commander. Your belongings were transferred to a separate room. - Your suitcase. - But why? I'm leaving today. I don't know, I can't. For superior instruction. - Right down the hall. - Thank you. That's great! Obviously worked. Congratulations. What conclusions did you draw from your speech? We need to strengthen the army, and a war against Hitler is inevitable. Yes... that's clear. Sooner or later we have to fight. It would be good if neither sooner nor later! It would be a little early now. The first conclusions drawn will follow after the first attack. Listen, Tojva. Maybe the Germans just stopped there for a while? After all, Germany has assured our government that that their troops are going to Finland. They hide the military technique, underground warehouses are being built. Comrade Tojva, isn't that an exaggeration? Many officers, service cars... - Do you think I misjudged it? - All right, all right, thank you, go and relax. These drawings, showing the technical units, were made by Tojva. The indication of some objects is completely incomprehensible. - Judging from the information, this is the division's headquarters. - It's bigger, Corps. And I even have to emphasise that I blindly trust this man. Experienced scout and old party member. You're still gloomy... That scout doesn't get out of my head. I highly... brought alarming information. So will there be a war? Why do you think the worst right away? This is what... Zvjagincev... Will you come with me to my brother? It is not worth celebrating alone. Aren't we stepping down? Don't you feel ashamed of yourself? No, it's not going today. - Why? - I have guests. - These? - Yes, he's my uncle. And even a major? Comrades! More... Aljosa, where are you going? Where are you going? - No, no, no! - Thank you very much. - I cannot do. - I don't recommend it! Honestly, I envy you, Aleksej. - You've been at war, you know what that means. - There's nothing to envy. Everyone does their thing. I'm a soldier. At your age, I did the same. I couldn't sit on my bottom. Say, Ivan Maksimovich, you were there during the "siege" of the Winter Palace? No, I wasn't. I wasn't even around that night. By the instructions of the Revolutionary Committee, I was on the Narvskoy road at the armoury. So the revolution was fought without me. - I wonder what came to your mind when you stood at your guard post? - I was wondering if my comrades would bring me a coat! It was cold! - Let's go dancing. - Let's go. Come on! Papa! Papa! - Aleksej, let's dance. - Glad. I think he's jealous. - Let it be. - Aren't you afraid? Mond, Aljosa... Can I go there too? To the front. - You've decided to become a doctor once... - No, that's not it. I'm just interested, can I? I think yes. Major Arnim Danwitz was one of Hitler's wing aides. Danwitz didn't play a great role in politics. But under Hitler's patronage, he thanked him with unconditional obedience. He saw his system in it and the ideal product for its upbringing. Listen to me, dear Danwitz... And he will learn for a lifetime the alphabet of modern politics. It may be good for Bolshevik Russia to exist, but my goal is for Germany to be the unattainable master of the world. - Do you understand me? - Yes, Führer. The clock struck. Did you hear, Danwitz? We have made the decision and we will not deviate from it. We are crushing Russia. St. Petersburg first. Yes, St. Petersburg - their sanctuary. But that is not the main goal. I need the Baltic bridgehead. The main blow to Moscow is measured from the north. This will be a surprise for the Kremlin. My Führer, I want great grace ask you. I want to be there in the east in the front ranks of our army. I want to be the first to bring the news of the great victory. The world I am building now will consist of such people like you, Danwitz. Heil, Hitler! I have appeared your order, General. General Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb, Commander of the Northern Army Group. I chose a responsible one. I entrust the task to you, Major. Come to the map. We break through the Baltic military district line of defence, called "special" by the Bolsheviks. We occupy Pskov and Ostrov. This gives a wide operating range to attack St. Petersburg. Do you understand my plan, Major? This is great! I ordered the 4th armoured Group, led by Colonel-General Erich Hoepner, there for the breakthrough. . I ordered him to create a good striking force. I'm wondering whom to trust the command of this force. - Are you listening? - It would be a great honour for me. I was waiting for that answer. I know the Führer also trusts you. Do you accept the responsibility of this command? With my life for Greater Germany and the Führer. With the lives of all of us a Great Germany and the Führer. At that time, Aleksej Alexandrovich Kuznetsov, who was the secretary of the Leningrad City Party Committee, found situation at the Finnish border very alarming. Andrej Alexandrovich, I'm coming now about district command. I decided to clarify everything. The information has been confirmed. And what do you want to clarify? The enemy is deploying troops across the Finnish border. You need to contact Moscow urgently about the counter-measures. The Central Committee knows. The same is true at the western border. Then how to interpret the report from Tas? This contradiction is intolerable felt the hand of Comrade Stalin. Yes, you are right. Comrade Stalin's purpose is understandable. First, you need to calm down the fears from Germany. Knowing the Western press, misinformation is regularly published about how we start the war. - I understand. - Second... The report from Tas also emphasised this. They tried to grope. To persuade Germany, they makes the same statement with regard to the Soviet Union. And yet... the location of the army I would locate it close to the border. Under no circumstances! There should be no opportunity to provocate the Germans. The border reinforcement works need to be accelerated... the work needs to be done even more actively, while I'm on vacation. So you're just leaving? Yes, Comrade Stalin insisted. BJELOKAMENSK Aunt Masha! - Oh, sir! - Aunt Masha! - Honey, we walked in a wagon because of you. - All right, all right! - Let me see it at last! - Sweet God! How beautiful you have become. - I already thought you weren't waiting. - How's your father? And your mother? Everyone is alive and well. Welcome. - Thank you. - And how is Peter? - Oh! Peter travelled to his station. - God! We just met Verocska! - Hi, Tolja. - Hi. Meet Anatoly, he is also from Leningrad. - Aunt Masha. - Anatoly. He came here by accident. - I'm very happy. - Yes, yes. Coincidentally, what? Yes. I thought they were resting in your city. Do you have any relatives or acquaintances here? None. The boys chose Sochi for the course, I chose chance. I Tolja the map and... I ended up in Bjelokamensk. - That's fine. - I think I look nice. - Nice, nice - Nice? Yes, yes. And you came for a long time? Today is the 20th of June... So, I still have 2 months 11 days free. It's free, so... Well, God bless you... Let's go, Verocska. - I'll tell you where you can get a room. - Thank you. - You have to travel today. - I don't think so. Why don't you understand that it doesn't fit? God knows what they will think. Verocska, I can't be away all summer, we will not have time to reconcile. "I Tolja the map"... Do you look at them as children? Why? Very nice, sympathetic people. Confidentiality is a must! Most importantly, everyone needs to understand your business! From general to soldier! The war with Russia is not a chivalrous affair. This is ideology and race; there will be a war of opposites. And in the most cruel way we can implement! Many people think that I do I want to conquer this country! No! I want to destroy it! I am physically destroying this people! The whole mixture of people, Slavs, Asians, Jews, Gypsies. Stubborn people who think they are human. Sit down. Dividing Russia, It should be placed under European patronage. Ukraine, as a buffer, will be a federal state of Germany. The Baltics and Belarus added, will also be attached to Germany. The Caucasus, with its oil fields, will be under German control. The whole operation takes a month and a half, maximum of two. They can put on my eyes: "Fight, and fight again." But I see the essence of the fight always survival. But no one can escape the fight, if you don't want to fail. The population is growing, it requires growth in vital areas. That is why war is needed! I did not create the Wehrmacht because of not to fight. I have always had an inner motivation for a war. Comrade Stalin, coded telegram came from the Kiev military district. The commander reported that a German soldier came across the border. The deserter said that he wanted to inform that they will begin their military action against the Soviet Union at dawn tomorrow. He said he was a communist, and considers the Soviet Union his friend. He risked his life, to warn us. Go! We have drafted an order that our Western troops goes on full alert. You can accept what the deserter says, wasn't it sent here by the Germans themselves? They're sure it's not provocation? We have been informed several times that the Germans want to attack the Soviet Union. At different times. And now... 22... - All this to intimidate the timid. - No, Comrade Stalin! The deserter is not lying! Show your ideas. Their proposed guidelines... I have to believe they are still early. Make another one, shorter. On the night of the 22nd of June provocation may occur at the border. We will not get rid of war. But Hitler can't be so stupid as to start a war against us now, without having finished with England. Of course, but it is possible that it concludes an agreement with England. And Churchill... he could have convinced the Germans to orient to the East. Then Hitler... there will be one more reason, which justifies him in the eyes of the public. But we can't give a reason for that! We need to be prepared for provocation, and we can't fall for it! There is silence... All over the Soviet border from the White Sea to the Black Sea. On this clear night, there was some strange silence. - Stalin. - Comrade Stalin, this is Zhukov. I call on behalf of the Commissar for defence. The Germans are bombing our cities. Can you hear me? - Where's the Commissar? - The Kiev military district is talking to a representative on the phone. Come to the Kremlin immediately, together with Tyimosenko! The enemy is bombing Riga, Minsk, Mogilev, Kiev, and Odessa. The enemy is attacking our border across the western front line. The German government has declared a war against us. Our military forces must reach the border immediately, resist the enemy by any means. Don't stop... destroy it! They give their ideas. Until then, until they cross the border. In addition to aeroplanes... This war is not brought on us by the German people not by German workers, peasants and intellectuals, but by a bloodthirsty click of German lords and fascists. The French were subjugated, the Czechs, Poles, Serbs, Norwegians, Belgians, Danes, Dutch, Greeks, and other nationalities. The Red Army and all our people will lead you to victory again - a Patriotic War; for homes, for honour and for freedom! Our true cause is to defeat the enemy, the victory will be ours! - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon! - Is the Commissar inside? - Yes, please enter. - Thank you. - Line eight. - Name? - I'm Nikitin, tenth. - Good afternoon. - What can I do for you, Comrade Kuznetsov? I don't even know where my head is. 1,500 applications in just two hours. - You could be happy about that. - No mobilisation has yet been ordered. What to do? What should I answer them? There's an old man here! You can see for yourself. In the directions Siauliai and Rava-Ruszka, enemy units have wedged into our area, then they returned across the border. South-west our troops recaptured Peremislj, which had been occupied by the Germans. In other areas, our counter-attacks did not achieve their objectives. Here... here... here, and here. In the direction of Minsk, armoured troops broke through our defences and seek as a "tick" to settle on the city. Here... and here... Despite selfless resistance and great losses of the Soviet troops they could not stop the enemy advancement in the Baltics. Here, here and here... "How did this happen? Why are our troops retreating?" These issues preoccupied Stalin. It has been strengthened in him for years the belief in his own infallibility and flawless foresight, that only he alone can make decisions, but Stalin was not given a chance to find the correct answer to the questions you were wrong about. But from the shock he received at first, he wakes up soon and again it will be the old Stalin, who they are used to. Meanwhile, tasks fell like an avalanche, the Political Committee, the Central Committee and to the staff of the Commissars. No one was idle. 1941, in the hot days of June, the German military communications only reported successes. Several kilometres of victoriously occupied settlements on the road, listed as trophies. But they didn't say that in Ukraine, the Soviet troops thwarted the German plan of a rapid rush to Kiev. The Brest Fortress was not reported, nor were the persistent defenders reported or that the Red Army recaptured Peremislj from the Germans. These reports were about the heroes repulsing the enemy's attack with four fortified Soviet divisions in the Minsk area. How our pilots started towards immortality, as they struggled with enemy machines. What happened? Major, he's in this woods near the old border. This is where the Bolshevik's "Stalin Line" begins. Nonsense! The Russians have long since abolished it! - Forward! - I get it. Major... our newsletters found the Russian phone line and they connected. - They're asking for reinforcements. - Go on, go on! They were ordered to leave the bunker and retreat. The command, surrender. The Russian soldier bunker! You are fenced in! Kill your commanders and your commissars! Surrender and you will live! Otherwise you'll meet the German flamethrowers! What did they answer? It's hard to translate. Something mum and Führer... They oppose. Müller, burn them out! What was that? - Who blew up the bunker? - The Russians blew it up by themselves, Major. There were five, Major. Ivanov - VKP / b /, Member of the Communist Party of Autumn in the Federal Republic. Vasilyev - VKP / b /... Korostiljov - VLKSZM (Komsomol)... Organov - BP, Kuzmin - BP... - What does "BP" mean? - Non-party member. - Looks like a small organisation. It's okay, thank you. - Do you want to? - You don't think so. Hold on, hold on! Hold on! I'm learning? Were they on vacation? - The weather was bad. - What can we do. Tolja got ill. He suffered from pneumonia. We still had to stay. - Her husband? - Not that... - We were just together. - I understand. - What's his name? - Vera. - And he's Anatoly. - And yours? Kravcov. Vera, sit in my seat, there is more air here. - Tolja, why did you do that? - He survives. - It's time to flirt. - What an impossibility. Don't be mad at me. I know it was nonsense. Believe me, he's annoyed. When he looked at me I saw him like that... Such... ... like someone running away from responsibility. Do you understand? It's been a week of war, and they don't even know where I'm going. Get out of the wagon! Everyone out! Fast! Vera, get up! They flew. Tolja! - Is that you? - I. - Break me a stick, Tolja. - Why? Crutches! I am injured. - I can see, I'm a medical student. - Look, young doctor. I'll be back. It should be tied. - Is there anything in this...? - Then myself. Sorry. Here it is. Therefore tears. So, did you go on vacation and got ill? Yes, he had pneumonia. Well, maybe it's better that way. What do you mean by that? I'm here because of the damn disease, I could not go to the queuing committee. Or maybe you were lucky? If you had to go to the front in the first few days, you may not even live any more and you live, you understand? - He's talking nonsense! - Tolja, why are you doing this? The comrade was just kidding. I love jokes, though, I don't feel like laughing at the moment! I'm a Komsomol member! There is a komsomolist, who wouldn't want to live? Life and the party are getting he tells her not to hurry. Don't have empty days, stick to everything, you make sense of it all, of course. Well that's it! I understand you. I despise and hate cowards! And we don't have to keep up with you. - Let's go Vera! - Will you leave me here? - A member of Komsomol will not leave a wounded. - Tolja, we have to take him with us. But to be honest, with your comments for me too... strange. All right. We'll take you to the very first house is and there I hope you will prosper without us. - It'll be good anyway. Hey, comrade! - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon! Say, Comrade, where are we really? - Actually on the ground. - Yes, I know. We came by train, we were hit by a bomb attack, we went to Leningrad, and now... Well, well... - What? Did you get a bullet? - Yes, from the pilot. Are you local? I'm Klepikovi. My name is Zsogin. Well, Zsogin, go to the your chairman's house and tell them to send a car quickly. - Try. - Is it worth it to me? Go a little further, I need to talk to the comrade a little. It's like a detective. It already appeared to me on the train, suspicious type this is Kravcov. The old man is so weird. - Give him advice. - I'll give it to him now. - Tolja. - Wait here! Well, did they discuss it? Here are the Germans, Tolja. In the neighbouring village. What? Zsogin promised to help us. They don't have Germans here yet. I feel Tolja, you can be trusted. Maybe to Leningrad we should separate. If you get there earlier than I do, right away, go to "Litejnyij Avenue" to the "Great House". Call the reception office by phone Major Tulikov. You say Kravcov sent you. Pass this on: "The goods have arrived, the store opens at the usual time. ”Repeat! - "The store opens at the usual time" - Not good! You missed the goods arrived. - No, no, I understand - Well. - Your family? Who is your father? - Balickij. My father is an architect. - Famous. - Not good! Your last name is Avilov. - Repeat! - Avilov? Your father died in 1919. He was an officer. You know he was shot by Cheka. Do you understand? - Why all this? - Therefore, listen! You grew up in an orphanage. You hate the Czechs, the People's Security Committee, etc... - Who do I have to tell all this to? - To the Germans. If necessary. - That's it. Don't tell Vera! - Don't you trust him? I would trust him, but a girl you might not be able to handle this. And you... Whatever happens to me... with us... the task must be performed. To! I understood. We don't know each other with you and Vera, we met by accident on the train. - Did you understand everything? - Everything, Comrade Kravcov. That's fine. Take the suitcase. Don't be afraid, Tolja, feel free! So, you think you are the enemy Can you approach Leningrad from the south? We must also consider this possibility, Comrade member of the Military Council. The Germans are halfway there, between the border and Pskov. Where do you plan to draw the line? Here, by the river Luga. How much time is needed to build the line? Our engineers need at least three months. In addition, another two to three weeks. Everyone needs to be mobilised, who is not a member of the army. And I think... this will be understood by the people of Leningrad. Especially that you already have such an experience, Andrej Alexandrovich. With the help of civic work, it has also significantly accelerated the construction of the Karelian Strait. Zhdanov! I want to talk to Comrade Stalin. Comrade Stalin, the Military Council believes the construction of a line of defence should be started immediately, the Luga line. It is 150 km from Leningrad. Yes, but for such a construction work we don't have enough arcade units. No, no. We counted on that. We have a suggestion. Get the general population involved in the work. I understand. I see, let's not cause panic in the city. I'm sure, that people will understand and they will support us, Comrade Stalin. Comrade Stalin agreed. The question is what kind of public participation we can expect today at a meeting of secretaries of area committees. Damn, what is this? A sewer should be dug in such a place. Uncle, this is not a sewer, a trench, to hide from the planes. Stop! - Stop working! Stop! - What's wrong, fellow citizen? You can't dig here! This is destruction. What kind of destruction? Come on, show me your papers! What do you want to do with the papers? Everyone needs to know: a ditch dug next to the building, breaks the protection of the foundations of the building. The building could sink! Cracks! - Are you sure about that? - Naturally. I'm an architect. There are many buildings in the city it was built according to my plans. I said stop work! There are engineers and accountants here. Sales women, but not an architect. We need you right here, comrade architect. My God! Where have you been? To work. Do you think I don't need anyone any more? Where...? I still... I can handle it. This creates a new line of defence at the river Luga. I want a report from all of you two hours later. - Understand? - Understand. - Understand. - They can leave. But...? How is that, Pavel Maksimovich? After all, we have nothing there. We don't have equipment, we don't... After all, the whole plan was to build in a northerly direction. - The Baltic Military District... - Stop chatting, Major Zvjagincev! There's war! And solving this is not a public matter. - Can that be understood? - I can understand everything, Comrade Colonel. I'm really sure now that my place is not with the staff, but at the forces! I have experience from the Finnish war, I am a battle commander... Oh, I understand? What is your last name? Suvorov or Kutuzov? The military handbook, if I could ask, would you check it out? On a white horse with a drawn sword! Gallop against the tanks! Forward! Forward! Comrade Colonel, you're not right! I will not run away from the enemy. If I have to, I will die where they are placed. But you don't choose the place yourself! He goes there and dies there, where the party claims! - What should I do? - You have to understand the command. That's all, Aleksej. Asking is always easier than answering. Go! No, no, nothing, Ivan Maksimovich. I just wanted to know if Vera had arrived? We? Didn't you travel alone? Ah-ah... I see. Still, let me know when he arrived. Here you go! Good afternoon. Who am I lucky? I'm Korolev. Ivan Maksimovich, Kirov factory worker. And... what can I do for you? I'm looking for his son. Didn't you hear anything about it? I don't understand. My son travelled to the Caucasus. Married? He had a son in Bjelokamensk, Anatoly. With my Vera. I called your aunt yesterday. He said they left. No, wait! - Is that all you wanted to say? - What else can I say? I told you what I knew. I thought you knew more about this. Fegya, who was this man? I heard you say something about Tolja. He came to tell your son he became entangled in a romantic story. He's joined up, God knows who... He lied to us. What do you say? - The boy went to the front and you... - Don't worry, Masa, you're not in danger. No, Fegya, no... - There's a war. - The last year's have been put on hold. I read, the war will not last long. - And does this man know where Tolja is? - No. Se thinks she travelled with her daughter. - Where? - I don't know! I don't know! - Why did Kravcov leave us? - How do I know. Maybe you have an acquaintance here. And why did he say that we don't know each other? For simple caution. If something happens to one of them, he does not drag the other into it. Do you think such... You can do? I don't think anything. You asked, I answered. Why are you worried? I don't need it. I'm sure everything ends well. - Aren't you afraid of me? - Verocska, honey! What about you? You don't have to be afraid of anything. I will always stay with you. I hadn't believed myself loving you before. I thought it was just a running feeling. But now I know in life we will be together forever. We always stay together. It seems to me now we will never be together again. - What are you talking about? Shut up! - No! - Maybe these are our last minutes, our last hour together. - What are you talking about? I have to tell you something. I have a lot to say, Tolja. If we didn't stay together... Which can't be! I want you to know, it's me the most expensive, the dearest... Sir, I curse myself for that I was afraid of our love! Do you see anything? Oh, a beautiful girl! Come on up, Commander! What does he want? Let it go! Drop it! Let it go! Filthy! Tolja! Beast! Tolja! Tolja! Look at the major! Major Danwitz is an officer in the German army. He commands you, just tell the truth! Otherwise he will shoot you, do you understand? - He shot me. - No... no, I'm telling the truth. I will tell the truth! Do you know this man? Answer me! We... met on the train. I saw him there. - Do you know who he is? - How the hell do I know who he is? Like I told you. - And who are you? - A student. An ordinary student. - Bolshevik? Komsomol member? - No, of course not... All right. The major said you were lying. In a team or with this checklist, you helped him. - Who? Am I a Chekist? - You don't seem to know the young man, Comrade Kravcov. But he is well known to us. I will remember him forever. And you, boss, damn Commissar you must have forgotten the Soviet's oppression of Zsogin, whom did you exile to Siberia? They tied my hands together when I went to their sister's collective farm with an ax, to protect my own relatives. Stop! Officer, believe me, I'm not lying! I don't lie! I never knew this man. If he's a Chekist, I hate him! They shot my father! They shot me, I'm not lying! When was your father shot? In 1919 after the revolution. His officers accused him of conspiracy. - Then I went to an orphanage. - What's your last name? Avilov. Avilov. I'd show you my papers, but they burned on the train. Interesting situation. The major gives you an opportunity to avenge your father. You can shoot this man. You can shoot, here you go. Shoot! Shoot, you bastard! I didn't even know you are the last white guard! Come on, shoot, you damn student! You're a cowardly villain! They would have given me a chance, I would have shot you first! So! What are you waiting for, weak-hearted? Shoot! Shoot, bastard! Shoot! Let me, sir, respectfully. I'll take care of it. Major Danwitz said you are a good guy. He ordered us to be released. Yes, yes. You have to go to St. Petersburg and you tell everyone about the German strength and power of the army. - Did you understand? - Yes. We will reach St. Petersburg soon. And you... you could say a thank you Major Danwitz, who is a true Teutonic knight (German Knighthood). Go! Hans! Come on! - We have an important assignment for you, Major. - I know. It is necessary to make the area undermined as soon as possible. - This is the most dangerous section of the road. - I see, Comrade Colonel. Well, then... have a good trip. It is possible that the Germans will try break through from the south towards Leningrad. Therefore, your division goes further to the river Luga, where we create a new line of defence. Тehát... the situation is clearing up. Chief Political Officer, Do you have technical training? Not really... After we called, some technicians appeared and remained. In civilian life, what did you do? - I was in charge of the Lenin Mausoleum. - Our Commissar fought at Halhin Gol. - For an honour. - You think? Yes. What is so surprising? They fought against the Finns themselves, they were given for it. Are you interested in it afterwards? No. I didn't have that opportunity. But at the political class I have to thrive. We can't care which battalion will be under his command. Hitler's military residence in the woods at Rastenburg, Eastern Prussia. As for the official documents It is called "Hitler's Headquarters." Hitler loved to use the more romantic name - "Wolfsschanze", which means "Wolf's Liar." Halder! Permit "Central" to let me start with the activities of an army group. In the coming days our forces will be able to fully break the enemy's resistance between Minsk and Smolensk. - I believe that... - Why do you start with the "Central" Army Group? I want to know, what's in the north with Leeb? St. Petersburg is our main goal! Their attack, My Führer, is the North successfully pursued. Except in the area of Libava (today's Liepāja). The truth is, here is where the Russian counter-attack was launched. I think under the influence of our air force... My Führer, sorry for the delay, I will explain immediately. These are different areas of St. Petersburg, which my pilot managed to photograph. The whole area of the city is changed due to camouflage. Here are the other photos: from the south, the Russians don't expect danger. We have to move beyond St. Petersburg as soon as possible! Russia's window to Europe, on which Peter I galloped confidently. We need to shut it down completely. The Baltic Sea could only be ours, German! My Führer, I'm not sure that our troops are still heading for St. Petersburg. They can move at the same pace as they do today. Sooner or later the Russians will understand our goals. Fantasise Halder! They are hampered by the imagination of their traditions. The attack is expected primarily from the north, from the Finnish border. They have fortifications and troops there. This is also supported by Göring's photographs. And the road is open to us in the south! RUSSIAN BIRDS! DON'T DROP US PUNCTIONS, WE ARE COMING WITH OUR TANK, TO BURY THE PITCHES! Fast, fast, fast boys! Bury, bury! Straighten it here. Straight, don't notice! Mark it there! And still there. There, there, there! Comrade Major, allow me to get here by a lorry? Because of the Germans. Dangerous. Then they better believe that the road is not undermined. Allow me to report, Comrade Major. - Division Commander Gorelov. - Division? I don't see any divisions, Lieutenant. - Where is their position? - We retired. The gateway is closed, they knew - from the enemy in front, mines behind. - Where did they come from? - From Riga. I can ask when he last encountered with an enemy? Last time we met with the enemy was near Ostrov. Don't blow on me, I'm not German. He should have been angry at the enemy! - What kind of troops did you have? - Section, squadron, battalion. What heroic deeds did he perform, how did you move forward so fast? The Germans helped. They killed the squadron commander, the century became mine. The battalion commander was killed, the battalion became mine. Then, why are you here when you are so brave? I stand before you now, Comrade Major, because I couldn't stand there. I can't say more. - How many people do you have? - A whole battalion. But the battalion's staff was reduced to a century. The others fell and did not rise again. Go with your people, eat something and prepare for the next task. Go. We didn't come here to eat, I have to report. We brought a civilian with us, we found him in the woods. He says he was given an important task. - Bring him here. - Got it! Comrade Zvjagincev, he could say such things to him? What? About closing the minefield corridor. You don't have to find the fault. Closed or open... It depends on the passage, not from me. That's true. And you, you really don't regret these people? It's not about regret. I'm a soldier and I think so. They taught me, they fed me and they were clothed at the expense of the people! So, when needed protect them from the enemy! And if that doesn't work? It is possible that we will have to retreat. - Then how... - Then we die! Have you ever booked them dead? Do few think on earth so easily? Comrade Major... you shouldn't talk about people like that. These days with dozens of soldiers... who retired, I talked and I tried to understand them. And what conclusion did you draw, you say? Simple, very simple. As long as the Germans are stronger, unlike us, they have great superiority. But the time will come when our people learn to fight and only the cowards will retreat without orders. I don't understand you, Commissar. The enemy smashes towards Leningrad, and you are looking for excuses. We will not let the enemy into Leningrad. But you don't think the lieutenant isn't like those retirees, who we met a day or two ago? He no longer needs to be agitated. He had already graduated from the University of Warfare. So... Sorry. Comrade Commander! You are? Anatoly! This is good. What a coincidence. To me as fast as you can I have to go to Leningrad. They were entrusted with an important secret task. And Vera? Where is Vera? You were together in Bjelokamensk. Nothing in this situation I can't say about it. I have an important mission to perform, until I'm done with it, I can't say anything. - Where? - From Libava (Liepāja). - German vending machine? - I borrowed it from a German. Comrade Commissar, would you allow so I can stay with you? Let's go to the battalion commander. Alas! What happened, Masha? - Mum! - Tolja! Tolja! Tolja... Kravcov's text message, didn't you get lost? This is very important. Not that gon... Everything is as he said. - You have to sign in the end. - Of course. So, were you bombed here? And could you show me where was the suitcase thrown? Somewhere here. I even remembered being nearby there were remains of a building. That's better. He was a real Chekist... Vasya Kravcov. Thank you. About this, our conversation, to no one, not a word! - Not even your father or mother. - I get it. - Are not you sleeping? - No. Listen to me, Tolja, I would like to ask something. This girl... Vera Korolev, is she back safely? - But you already asked, and I... - When you ran into the Germans, were you together? Yes, together. I tried to defend it! I confronted the Germans! Do you understand? Defied! There was nothing I could do, there were many. They were dragged and locked in a barn. - I panted in pain, I vomited! - And Vera? Did you stay there with the Germans? Dad, there was nothing I could do, they would have been killed. I was given an important task! And I did. You understand? Yes, yes... I see. - Shoot, you bastard! - Tolja! Heats. You never come to the table in time. Is there anything new in the office? I'm up to my neck at work, I was left alone in committee. I'll refine the list of people who they go to the front. I will separate the Komsomol members. Someone messed it all up. They are afraid they will not even let go of the front. Do you really want to go to the front, Tolja? I can not understand your question. Look, it seems to me for every situation you have an alternative. I think in everyone's life there are moments when a second option, chance... no. Why these big words? And usually... your suspicion hurt me! I really don't know you, Anatoly! - I've been shot, I know what that means! - Tolja, I want to... The local defence centre is talking! Air Alert! Air Alert! I see you have no patience to wait for my funeral and to become a father of a hero. - Fear, come to the shelter quickly, you hear? - I'm not going anywhere. - Fear, get up! - I said I'm not going! I don't want to hide! I spit on these... to the damn fascists! - Vasily Ignyatovich Petrov... - I object! He's the best of the Toljas. With us, Comrade Director, there is nothing wrong. - What, are we postponing it? - We're postponing it. - Ivan Maksimovich Korolev... - What are you laughing at? I won't leave! - What does "I won't leave" mean? - Whatever it means, I won't leave! Aleksej Alexandrovich... Take care of it! - Good afternoon, comrades. - Good day... They are able to send the whole group to the front. They think we make a camping cook here. What is produced here it is already known to the Germans. This is a war letter. The Commissars sent it from the front, read it. One of your KV tanks has fought 10 German tanks! - It was an outage! - Don't say! - All right! - That's right! But from some of their employees they must divorce. The situation on the front... extremely severe. The Territorial Party Committee has decided to begin recruiting volunteers. This will be called the "People's Militia Division." Here is the answer of the Kirovians. 15,000 statements! And there will be more. To the main production department of the plant, the government suggests stop! The equipment is urgent but we have to ship it inland. This regulation is of course valid... to other plants in the city as well. So, Kirov is over. No, comrades. They could imagine this city without plants, without the Red Putyilov factory? We need the right strength in this part of the front. And there in the Urals, the other Kirov, it will not be worse than in Leningrad. Well, Ivan Maksimovich, still asks the party committee to release him. The Military Council intends to appoint you to head one of the National Militia. Commissar. I repeat to you, Dad, I can't be admitted to the militia. It would be an honour for me if I had a relative, young man. - In what sense? - I would ask, who is the person here are you in the highest position? This is the division Commissar, but I repeat, respectfully, that... Don't get tired, don't get tired. Regards. Sorry, but without permission can't be to our commander... Something... Vera? Yes? Is your son back? What about him, talk! - My son is back. - And Vera? - Let me sit down. - Of course. Sit down. Sit down. His daughter... ... stayed with the Germans. - How did you stay with the Germans? They returned to Leningrad, but their train was bombed. Then came the German tanks, captured... Anatoly managed to escape. So... But I came to you on a personal matter. A statement? After registration to the third department. - You're a commander, aren't you? - I refused, I'm not a commander. Everything seems to be fine. Delete from the register. - He has no military training. - I'm an architect and an engineer. And I can safely say he is trained. And no doubt, you don't just need the who can stab... and shoot with a gun. There's nothing I can do. Looks like no one needs... a trained old man. Do you know the construction stuff? I'm sorry, but I've built some houses already. But new houses are not being built now, they are just ruined. I ask you at home with building fortifications? All basically trained architects is an expert in this. Go to the construction department, second floor. Thank you. Thank you. The Luga Task Force joins forces, led by General K. P. Pyadisev. The Military Council decided to confirm the Luga group with a reserve division, which he withdrew from the direction of Petrozavodsk. Two more divisions, from 10th Engineers, are withdrawn from the Karelian Strait. In addition, we provide cadets of the Leningrad Military School, an artillery regiment, and an air defence division. You will need it when the tanks come. This power is still not enough for us. We extended the protection area very wide. In less important areas supervision of smaller teams will be limited. The situation is difficult, I know. But the Military Council didn't have any other options. The reserves are exhausted. That is why we urgently need to go to war with the popular militias. - Will you allow me, Comrade Marshal? - Yes. I think such an extensive area may be missing teams, but only one engineer's battalion to my right is required. There is no need for popular militias. Division of National Militias is only formally present in our division. That's how we stand! I may have a question... To the Commissar of the People's Militia Division. There is no retreat with the division. That is little for me, Commissar. - How long have you been in the army? - Two weeks. - Not counting the Civil War. - That's it! When a tank climbs around your neck, and on top of that a fighter throws a kiss, those two weeks will be few! And when his soldiers flee, agitation and propaganda will not help either! How can you talk like that Comrade Chorohov? He sent you this division of Leningrad's best sons. Let me... I'll answer. You may be the Comrade Colonel who recaptured Minsk and Riga, defended Pskov. Maybe our people, who were captured by the Germans, he was rescued from there. - Comrade Marsall... - But you, Colonel, face the facts. They may know the enemy wrestle - do it! We have enough work in the plant. And that's not how we thank you for your help. And whoever is worth something is fighting. We discussed it. The people's militias are a huge help to the front. We must not forget that. That's it, comrades! Get to work! The point is to use artillery, destroy and shoot tanks! Roger that! Please be careful, the last angle is also needed... To the fight! - Be more careful! - All right. I beg you! - How did architect Balicki get here? - Like the others, volunteer. It's not right. It is well known that he is a famous specialist. There would be no particular need for him here on the front. - An old man has a nature. - I know. - Send him back anyway. - I get it. Look! Here, to my right of the defensive wing located in the division of the People's Militia. I will expand on this by road and by train from Pskov. And you will be here. - How many machine guns do you have? - Three, bulletproof. Did you visit or go to war? - 300 bayonet rifles and three bullets! - We don't have a bayonet rifle, Comrade Colonel. - militia carry light rifles. - Walking, walking... It would take a lot. All right, I'll give you three heavy machine guns. Fresh infantry units are arriving, switching. If no militia arrive, stand up with your own technical unit! Stand up to the last man! And remember - don't mind if you leave the fascists, we assume he's dead! Comrade Colonel, you know, explain to us what happened? So they don't know yet? Yesterday the Germans occupied Pskov. The headquarters are new created a direction - north-west. To the commander-in-chief, they nominated Marshal Vorosilov. Do you understand now? Understand. Come on, come on, come on, Razgovorov. Bravo! Szurovcev! No one can shoot without my order no one can shoot! Got it, we're not shooting. Tell each section. And if they don't - to hell... Enter the section... do they "walk" into the trap? ... the first. They walk in, they walk in... You have to! The "baker" will tell you get ready! I'm the "baker of the century"! Pass to sections: without my permission, don't shoot! Roger that! Without an order, don't shoot! Without an order, don't shoot! Pass it on! Without an order, don't shoot! Without an order, don't shoot! What are you waiting for? You can see, everything is quiet, calm... The road is clear. Come on, come on... Direct the first! On! The trap worked, Comrade Major! It worked! Joy is early. It is starting now. Fire! We? Hold on if I say it! Leningrad is behind you! All right, as you know! So, hold on! Where are you going? Where? Back! Back! Back! Persevere! Hold on, boys! Leningrad behind us! Make bottles and grenades! Comrade Major, the "First" is looking! I'm listening, Comrade First. It's normal with us. Thanks for the guns. They are of great help to us. The tanks are to the left, towards the militias. Please go over to them. Help them if they need to. At the same time, warn them that the German tanks are going towards them. - Comrade Major, let me... - It was beautiful, Razgovorov! Your plan worked! How are you? It's nothing. Only my coat was torn. - Let's go to the volunteers! - Got it! What's up, Major, were you afraid you wouldn't succeed? - As you can see, we persevered. - Sent by the division commander. He ordered me to warn you tanks are holding here. She's there, take a look. Binoculars have been seen. You will have to deal with these here... It's just... the soldiers don't believe in setting fire to their tanks. Tanks from the right! Come on, Serjoga, come on! Legal times! Serjoga was killed... No more seeing him on the St. Petersburg side. And in the end for us... Sky! Sky! Comrades, the tank is burning from the bottle! Let the fascist bitangs burn! Come on boys! Come on, their mother is everything! I'm sorry, but throw it away for me. Comrade Commissar, our tanks! Ours... Ours! Kiroviak! Kiroviak! Follow me! Hurrah! - Colonel Rogyin! - You arrived on time. And this... begins to turn in our favour. I see it too, they did their thing here. It's nothing. We broke them in the waist. We roasted them The fascists will remember this day. We made this. Well, how did you do it? - Excellent tank. - Yes? Protects against fascist bullets. - My dream is to go to Berlin with him. - God forbid! God forbid! Berlin was still very far away. But these days in July, the military formations and soldiers and commanders of popular militias stood in the way of the fake-armed enemy, who intended to liquidate the Arbor of defence line. And whom almost a month arrested in their defence, to gain time In order to strengthen Leningrad. The End of the First Film PULKOVO MERIDIAN Second film Well, Major. I'm dying. Please tell my family. Stop it, Müller! No... no, it's so natural for me. I've been waiting for this for a long time. He expected? Yes, yes, I was waiting. I was waiting for this class, when the noise of battle passes... not smell the blood and the fires. What happened to us? - We were wrong about a Russian mines. - And the others? Are the others dead? I don't know exactly. But we will still be drinking in the "Astoria", at the famous hotel in St. Petersburg. No, I don't drink any more. And, Danwitz himself, you're sure how will he be there? What are you talking about, Müller? I've never seen how they have equated with the earth? The destruction started easily, then, everything became difficult. Initially, they were crushed, destroyed... Increasingly! You're a geologist, Müller. You were always too sensible for a soldier. No, no major, it is completely different. We thought this land... was very soft. But this only applies to the top surface... Towards the middle, it's like granite. Stop it, Captain! I order you to listen! I pause, I will soon be silent forever. They could have been shot with cannons, or the planes? Was he killed by a bayonet? What makes you think the Germans went here, in the back of the militia? What the hell are these... women and children. Back, Rozgovorov! Back! I hide the car in the woods. That's it. Vasya Rozgovorov was lost. - What about you? - My feet, my feet. Germans! Fast into the woods! That's it, Pastuhov, I can't go on. To hell with it! Did the Germans break through our defences? I don't think... we would have heard then the sound of cannons and tanks. Maybe a parachute... a paratrooper. What shall we do? You need to get to headquarters urgently, to warn Chorohov the Germans broke through. I'm not going alone. If on my back, but I'm dragging with me. - Don't carry! - But I'll take you, I'll take you! Where did you get training? In the army? Go, Yevgeny Ivanovich, go! We are not far, eight kilometres. All right, Aleksej. But calm down, I'll be back. It costs what it costs. Here's another magazine, one is enough for me. Well, as they say, goodbye. Just... don't change it under any circumstances! Did you understand! - Wait, did you see anything? - Nothing, we can go. Come on! With much less noise! Next! Come on, come on! Go left! To the left! Hurry - hurry! Comrades! Pasztuhov! Who is there? Come here! I'm injured, I can't. Who are you? Major Zvjagincev. And you? Vostrikov, secretary of the Luga party committee. We came to comb through the woods. They say paratroopers landed somewhere here. They are with sappers. Szavkov! - Go ahead with your people! - Got it! First squad, after me! His leg looks pretty ugly. Hey, Doctor, come here! Aljosa! Vera? Aljosa! Aljosenyka! Follow me! Are you hurt? I'll check right away. Patience! Patience, I will do anything. Immediately... - Well, how are you, Aljosa? Better already? - Right. Vera... - How did you get here? - I'll tell you one day. But how could you be here alone. - Why, Anatoly... - He is not here. He was shot by the Germans. What? But he is in Leningrad. We? What did you say? - What..? Do you Tolja alive? - He's alive. He came with retreats from the south, I saw him myself. No, no, no! It can't be. Where is he now? - Where is he now? - I already said, in Leningrad, at home. - Well, we're here. - And the battalion? It's okay, Major. The battalion is in place. - Varvara Semyonovna, good day! - Fyodor Vasilyevich... - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon! - Aren't you hurt? - Nonsense! A little scratch. You can see... ... sent home. - No one is at home with you. - How come? - They left a message. And the key. Dear Papa! Mum was evacuated to the Urals. I was mobilised so it was time for me to act. The "alternatives" have run out. Aljosa Our forces will continue to fight with the enemy at Smolensk, Koroszteny, Belaya Cerkov directions and on the eastern front. On the front in the position of the troops no change was made. I have been honoured to conquer the second Bolshevik capital. I placed him under his command two armies and an air fleet. Your situation was not like on other fronts, there were no strong lines of defence, there were not a large number Russian military troops. And you, von Leeb, are still 200 km away from where you should be! St. Petersburg must be occupied! As soon as possible! Listen to my command! Maps! We need to end the frontal attacks on the Luga line. You cannot succeed in this area. Find a detour. Attack the Russians at Novgorod and Kingiszepp. Attack! Attack them with all your might! Furthermore, the Moscow-St. Petersburg line must be cut from the Mga district. For you in the coming days, you must launch a decisive operation with our army. Sorry My Führer, maybe that means that we are postponing our military attack against Moscow? I'm no worse than my generals, I am aware of the importance of Moscow. You will be busy! After you, von Leeb, have occupied St. Petersburg, and von Rundstedt isolated Ukraine. This will deprive Moscow of wheat and coal. We will all be fascinated by the Kremlin! The resistance by the Russians in my front line is getting stronger. It is natural! Stalin is unaware of it, to lose St. Petersburg, and thus he is on the brink of total defeat. Therefore, we now need to confirm your army to the detriment of the "Central" Army Group. That is all! I look forward to your action! Desperately! I'll do it, My Führer! I honour you, Major Danwitz, with the Order of Merit of the Iron Cross. Congratulations. Why are you listening? My Führer, I don't deserve this award. My force retired, my tanks were shot, I burned and became unusable. But you fought bravely. And you will have the opportunity in the coming days prove, that you deserved this award. My Führer, it can't be... have we underestimated the enemy? I don't know what moves them, fear, despair, or Bolshevik fanaticism. They blow it up with themselves their besieged fortifications. They keep the last ball to themselves, not to have to surrender. I can't understand this... why? - And what do you think might be an excuse? - No, no, there's no excuse. But it teaches us how to break it the resistance of the enemy. - Just say a word and I understand. - Cruelty! - But what... - No, Danwitz! You have to be so cruel to make all mankind shudder! Remember - cruelty! Repeatedly and repeatedly cruelty! Soldiers! After the Bolsheviks army, it remains the civilian population of St. Petersburg. It also consumes its last human reserves... The "North" Army Group, even after a breakthrough, we can celebrate our victory! And the war with Russia is over! - Heil Hitler! - Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Between 10 July and 8 August von Leeb's 29 divisions, with 1,200 aircraft, with nearly 1,500 tanks, with 12,000 artillery pieces, bombed and bombarded the population of Leningrad and the Leningrad Front, which defended itself with the soldiers. On 8 August, at Kingiszepp, the enemy broke through our defences and he Tolja forward, escaping the pavilions defence wings. Leningrad was in mortal danger. On the 20th of August, at a meeting of party activists in Leningrad, Vorosilov is threatening the city - he spoke of danger. Still, he permeated his speech cheerfulness and optimism. He said to Soviet troops they have the opportunity not just stop the enemy, but also to destroy it. His speech to Zhdanov had a rough and bitter effect. A question of life and death. Or the working class of Leningrad becomes a slave and destroyed in its entirety, or clenched into a fist gather all your strength and dig the tomb of fascism in Leningrad! The next day in the Leningrad newspapers published by Vorosilov, Call of Zhdanov and P. S. Popkov. TO EVERY EMPLOYEE IN THE CITY OF LENIN! My comrades in Leningrad, my dear friends!... Krasnoye Szelo Sailor brothers! Baltic fleet! Comrades, my warriors! I don't have to mention their oath of allegiance, their oath they made to their homeland! These are sacred vows, what we absorb with breast milk! With your abbots at the time I fought against the White Guards! They would not be worthy to the oath of their fathers? We really head your eyes in front of fascists? This can not happen! We skewer them, now, immediately! Well then, come on! - Does it hurt? - Yes, but it's not... it hurts. BAKERY Alas! What is this? Bombarded? No, it wasn't bombing. On the 4th of September, set up in northern Tosno with long-range cannons, the Germans first started shooting at the streets of Leningrad. On the 8th of September, the enemy occupied Slisszerburg and thus the ring of blockade was closed. On this day, the German Air Force attacked the city for the first time. Come in. - Good afternoon, Comrade Kuznetsov! - Good afternoon, Comrade Stalin! - Did you see Zhukov? - I wasn't at the People's Security, I came to you straight from the aerodrome. Replaced Vorosilov as the leader of the Leningrad Front. We appointed Zhukov as commander. He doesn't seem to know about it yet. The enemy broke through the line of defence North of Krasnoye Szelo. From the heights of Pulkovo they fire at the city. This also made the fate of St. Petersburg more difficult. They make it very difficult. Sit down. What ships can the Baltic fleet use to participate in the defence of Leningrad? The artillery of our ships shattered the area close to the city enemies. You... - Will you allow me, Comrade Stalin? - Yes. Here, between the islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa, and west of the Hanko Peninsula, the island of Gogland and the Eastern bay's other islands. Both the shores and the water area in front of them is currently in the hands of the enemy. At the Tallinn crossing we lost 60 ships. 59, Comrade Stalin. 59, from 197 ships. Very big loss. - But they may have had bigger losses. - Yes, Comrade Stalin. The Germans thought they could sink the whole fleet. After our flying squadron left Tallinn... we were subjected to fierce attacks. That was hell itself what our ships went through. I'm sure it wasn't and won't be another such fleet in the world, with sailors such as the Soviets, who were capable of this feat. Why are you telling me all this, Comrade Kuznetsov? Why? I know they are sailors of the Baltic Fleet. They have fulfilled their duties. But now let's talk about something else. Circumstances may also arise that... the Germans may break into Leningrad. I order you to be prepared to blow up our ships. No ship should... get into enemy hands! None! You are personally responsible for executing the order if required! Send a telegram to V. F. Admiral Tribuc, by my order. "Prepare to destroy ships." I have such a telegram, Comrade Stalin... I can't sign it. Why? Because it is the People's Commissar of the Navy signature, few here, Comrade Stalin. Go to Saposhnikov and get ready take the order with two signatures, with the chief of staff and his own. No, no, my friend, this case concerns only the fleet, and I will not add my signature to it. Maybe you think this order is too early? No, Nikolai Gerasimovich, I don't think so. Than why not? Because war is war. And anything can happen in a war. You... vouch for that the order we received some hotspots there in the Baltic Sea, doesn't rush, and act earlier than necessary. Boris Mikhailovich, a real sailor will first commit suicide before he is sinking his ship. I have no doubt, my friend, I believe I have no doubt. Whose signature should be in front of you? Yours? Mine? It belongs to the Supreme Commander. All right. Leave it here with me. We have to go to Smolny. It can't be without a password, Comrade General. - Call the commander of the guard. - He's talking to General Zhukov! The guard is right. Voroshilov Send orders to the front to Zhukov, leave for Moscow immediately. J. Stalin. Comrades! He came to us as the new commander of the Leningrad Front, Army General Zhukov. Generals I. I. Fegyyuninsky and S. M. Hozin also came with me. Sit down, Comrade Generals. What issue did you discuss at the Military Council? We are currently working on mining, the most important military actions, and the industrial facilities. For what purpose? In the event of an emergency, Georgiy Konstantinovich. - The enemy, as is well known, is at the gates of the city. - That's right, Andrej Alexandrovich! I suggest removing the question from the agenda. And the closing of the Military Council meeting. For me, in more details, I need to get acquainted with the situation. - Don't you mind, Andrej Alexandrovich? - Order. Invited comrades may leave! Members of the Military Council and the head of communication, please stay. Where are the operations and intelligence maps? Here, and here. We don't have Kliment Jefremovich's time for excessive formalities. We close this Military Council. If the members of the Military Council agree, we can still meet, say... At 23:00. Zhukov took command. It was handed over by Vorosilov. - Where's the command room? - In the basement, Comrade Commander. Get there! Outstanding Commander of the Civil War, Commissar character, temperamental. Vorosilov was one of the communists, who went forward and as a believer in the ultimate victory as a hero, he failed first. Here in Leningrad, ignoring the dangers, when he appeared at the head of the leadership, he slept restlessly and consulted in a car. With the vast experience of modern warfare, led the army into battle as commander, yet something else was needed now. - Is there a connection to the staff? - Of course, Comrade General. Forward! At the device Zhukov. Please report it to Comrade Stalin. I took command at the front. Point. Zhukov. Units of the newly transformed 42nd Army, with neighbour 55, defended Leningrad from the south. But they were forced to fight fiercely to give up Krasnoye Szelo and retreat to the line of defence in Pulkovo. Complicating the situation that our main strength in this area, which includes the popular militia, suffered heavy losses. To support the Uritsk region we relocated urgently Division 21 of the People's Security Committee for the Interior. But that doesn't seem to be enough. Major Sidorov. Who are you? I asked who you were and why you appeared without permission? Colonel Korolev, chief of operations. Comrade Commander, now I got a message that the Germans broke in to the Kirov factory site. What kind of Germans? I don't know, this was reported over the phone. - I thought I should report... - Who reported it to you? Major Sidorov called, commander of the fighting battalions. - He... said that the Germans... - With what forces? I don't know. I found it necessary to avoid wasting time, to report immediately. I ordered the battalion commander to be on your phone and wait for further instructions. Head of communications, turn that omen here. Roger that! I'm listening, emergency bird! Who showed up there with you? I didn't ask, Germans or Turks. I asked, with what forces? What unit do you command? Kindergarten or battalion? If they are battalions, then fight! Anyway, you didn't see them yourself! Listen to me now! If a German wants to break through your side, even with a tank, even with a walking stick, shoot him down! Did you understand? Otherwise I'll shoot you! He didn't understand anything. The section commander told him he saw tanks moving west of Kirov. I don't think tanks, a tank... It could also be just a tank... Panicking. If someone else bullying, I'm demoting! Now go out to the Kirov area, and report by phone in 40 minutes. What kind of Germans appeared there? - But don't report to me - to my adjutant! - Got it, Comrade Commander! So, according to the message you sent, the enemy merged forces here between Popsa and Pulkovo. - That's right? - That's right. Then, what the hell did you claim just as densely troops across the front line? The Germans wedged in with tanks, at the height of Uritsk and Pulkovo. They expect from here, that they break into Leningrad! We need to join forces here! Georgiy Konstantinovich, position according to what you marked on the map; those events of the last hours. Nevertheless, he is right. The troop locations do not correspond to the new situation. Louder! Why are you whispering like a boy to the girl? Comrade Commander, Colonel Korolev reported by phone. Enemies haven't been found on the the Kirov factory site. A small group of motorcyclists leaked into the "Forel" hospital area, but there was no clash. - All right, go, don't bother. - Got it! That is why we need to change the boundary line between Armies 42 and 55. The 42nd Army of Uritsk and Pulkovo defending in the direction of, this is the main thing today. That is why I order: we eliminate Front 42 at the expense of the 55th Army. But Comrade Commander, with that we weaken the Kolpinsky direction, and sooner or later the enemy intelligence will find out. What will you do when the Germans break through at Uritsk or Pulkovo? - I order the troops not a step back. - I know your orders, have in fact not been implemented. I asked what would happen if the Germans do really break into the Kirov factory? And not some motorcyclists, but great forces? He doesn't know the answer to that. Even without you, I know you are fighting. They are already deep in the protection areas. There are already groups... but of those really very little. Comrade Commander, we were forced to throw all our reserves into the battle, including cadets of the military schools and the fighting battalions. I know about the great work that the urban party organisation performed. I know about it, Andrej Alexandrovich. How many guns and tanks do they think they know the Kirov factory can produce today? This is the latest information. Follow everything! I agree with the rate. How many anti-aircraft guns can be removed and hand over to the fighting troops? But, Comrade Commander... the city has been subject to violent bombing for weeks. Answer my question! Why protect the city with air cover when... the Germans with their tanks - are they attacking the streets? You have 15 minutes to report to me how many and what weapons you can hand over! - Do you understand? - Exactly, Comrade Commander. I think Georgy Konstantinovich, additional line of defence is urgently needed along the detours. You're right. We desperately need additional lines of defence, but with what forces could we hold them? We need to make another call between the Communists and the Komsomolists. Once again, we need to recruit more volunteers from the factories, offices, the People's Security Committee and the police. Maybe to you, the soldier, this sounds like a sounding phrase..., but as long as communists live here, the power of Leningrad is inexhaustible. All right. Define: shape... 5 infantry brigades and 2 infantry divisions. Concentrating them tightly to protect the city. - That's right? - That's right. And finally... we recommend Colonel N. V. Gorodetsky to be exempt from the work as the Chief of Staff. As a new Chief of Staff, M. Sz. Hozin is appointed. General Fedyuninsky will be my deputy. Is there an objection? Everyone agreed on the question. Everyone see to perform the tasks they been given. This is Walter! This is Walter! Published. I left Uritsk on the left, 20-49 quadrants. I look forward to seeing you. Lieutenant Colonel! What are you doing here, Lange? That was his order to break into Uritsk! We couldn't break through, Herr Oberst. It was hell. Firewall. We lost seven vehicles, yet we were also fired at with anti-aircraft guns. Coward! I deprive you of your right to take part in our victory march! A tram! Then this is St. Petersburg, Colonel. Soldiers, follow me! Fast! Soldiers! This is St. Petersburg! Follow me! Get off, people! Terminus! Get out, get out. Fire! Riddled! Lange! Report to the HQ, my regiment first crossed the border of St. Petersburg. Roger that! Comrade Kuznetsov, yesterday, we decided that 40 tons of explosives must be transported as technical reserve into the "triple" district. - Can you arrange that? - I can. At a meeting of the Military Council, in which you appeared so suddenly, tests for explosives related activities were discussed. - Then you have ordered the conclusion of the deliberations. - And that's okay. In the event we have to give up the city. Comrade Zhukov... about possible posting it was never and could never be! We all know that the Germans can break into the city, but only through our bodies! If we have to fight at every house, on every barricade, on every... street! and they... they will drown in their own blood. That's why, please... No, no, I demand! Never use the word "posting". I know the protection without perfect organisation. Our city cannot be defended, so we always, in everything, your... we will help you. The issue we talked about Georgiy Konstantinovich... is that, between us, there must be full agreement. Andrej Alexandrovich... in the current difficult situation, it's not just our job to protect, but to actively resist the enemy. If yesterday the Germans were busy a village, a station or on a hill, today these villages, stations, would need to be reclaimed. If you fail today, tomorrow, but must be booked at all costs! We need to take the initiative from the hands of the enemy, this is our task! Otherwise death awaits us! They will bomb us. And, the idea of a retreat inevitability, it has to be knocked out of people's heads. All this in a human way! - Free? - Aljoska! - Aljoska! You live? - I live. You live! Come on in! Come! Tell me. Where have you been? What should I tell you, Pavel Maksimovich? - I was lying at the medical battalion. - Yes. Then I was in the hospital, and now I'm here. Suitable for military service. This is amazing! - You need the task force. - He is not. I'm already a passenger commander. - I'll ask first. - Yes? Yes. - Comrade Commander! - I'm going to Fegyunininsky. - What happened in the last few hours? - These are the latest reports. General Ivan Ivanovich Fegyyuninsky had been appointed commander of the 42nd Army the night before to protect the Pulkovo Heights. Who is this? Major Zvjagincev is driving from the technical department. - And why hang in here once a technician? - Comrade Commander, while performing a combat mission at the Luga defence line, I was injured. - I just came from the hospital. - Are you properly cared for? - What kind of injury did you have? - My leg. He doesn't want to work for the staff. He wants to work in the field again. On it, walk! It's up to. - Head to Kirov. - Got it! Clear. Comrade Commander, why a plant? I asked to be sent to the front. I know... The fact is, that at Kirovra, the Germans fired with sub-machine guns, you know? You have to build barricades in the streets. From the territory of Kirov Uritsk, tank for half an hour. - Head to Kirov today. - Got it! - What ignited? - The blacksmith shop. They will be put out soon. The bitangs fired an incendiary grenade. It caused the fire. - Free? - Here you go. Comrade Military Council, Major Zvjagincev, I'm reporting. They were directed from the front staff to the plant, to help build fortifications. Good afternoon, Comrade Major. - Get to know. Director of the plant. - Zajcman. - Party secretary of the Kirov KP. - Kozin. Let's sit down. We talked about your work. The party committee recommends dividing the protection area into three parts. If they break through, we can protect all parts of the plant, every square metre of our area. This... the devil knows this, Comrade Kuznetsov. I knew they were here and right away I wanted to talk to you. But they didn't want to let it in. If I understood correctly, they didn't call me here and they didn't even deal a card. We are building an emergency water supply at a ridiculous pace. And despite my categorical protest, they took 30 workers from me. Comrade Balicki, we have an agreement with you, that with all technical issues, turns to the main energetic! But this is not a technical issue, do you need help with this? This is defence. Protection! The workers, who have been taken from you, went to battle stations near the plant. Do you understand this? I understand, I'm sorry. Yes, but one solved problem doesn't exclude the other. We will take the appropriate steps. We will. You will be sent the right workforce. Thank you. Thank you, I'm sorry. Sorry. This is the area for repairs. The tanks are brought straight from the front. And that's there... the second defence sector. - I see. - Shall we walk around? - Yes, yes. Aleksej? - Ivan Maksimovich! - How did you get here? - Good day... - Wait a minute! - Vera said you had an injury to your leg. - Yes, but I'm already out of the hospital. - Yes? - Yes. - And now you're here with us? - Here. - But, how are you here? - I came back. As a professional, I came back. But now, you see, you have to fight again to go. I'm not going to the front, the front is coming to me. How is this, my friend Aleksej. Wrong, Ivan Maksimovich. - Very badly. - Nothing, nothing wrong... Air raid! Air raid! Paratroopers from German planes jumped out over the area of our factory. The military detachment should go immediately to their tanks! Air Alert! Air Alert! - This! This is it! - No, it's not a parachute. Don't shoot! It's a bomb! Down! Down! Death to the paratroopers! Death! - Death is a drop... It's there! - Lie down! Lie down! - Her death... - Lie down! - Who is alive? - This is. - Dad! Dad! - So! - Verka, where...? - We brought the wounded to the hospital. Then we go to the front line again. Aljosa! Aljosa! Why didn't you call me? Why didn't you come? Wait! - I just got out of the hospital yesterday. - Visit me, Aljosenyka. I'm not far from here. Promise us if we stay alive we will definitely meet. Please. I just understood how awful it is to lose our loved ones. All right, Vera. Be it the way you want. Why did all this happen? The Russian soldiers why didn't they kill their Commissar? In and around St. Petersburg why didn't the people revolt? We need to take another step, only one breakthrough, a cleverly thought-out operation, to defeat this damn city! This is Zhukov. In the current state of the Kronstadt artillery, can you suppress the fire of these hooligans? The land artillery and of the fleet are constantly firing their guns at the enemy that shoots at the city. But enemy planes are bombing our ships, so we have to deal with them too. Why, what did you think, Fritz allows to waste iron on them? Rather, shoot the following areas: Pulkovo Mountain and Otradnoje. That's where the enemy has heavy artillery. I'll give you half an hour to fill their mouths! Shouldn't we even call Novikov? No, it is not necessary Andrej Alexandrovich. All fighters are already in the air. And V. F. Tribuc shouldn't have been called either. Even without us, they know well which areas to shoot at. But I called to reassure you. Please sit down. So there is nothing left for us, just like sit and wait. Andrej Alexandrovich, we are incapable of any change there. People do what they have to. It makes no sense to tease them. They toss under fire from one place to another. We must not leave our place of command. I understand, but I want to know that. What do you want to start with? I am thinking. I want to decipher... to see what the Germans have figured out. It would be very important to know if von Leeb rushes to the city on his own, or Hitler sends him fresh units. What do you think? We didn't receive any new information from our intelligence on any arrival of new enemy units. First, scouts can make mistakes. Second, Hitler can start the transfer, and at the same time, start a massive attack against the city. And what makes you think Hitler won't do that? I try to imagine myself in his place. von Leeb has been trying for more than two weeks to break through the defence of the city. He ran like a dog to the fence, then he stops. I don't think Hitler tolerates this for a long time. Leningrad is strategic for Hitler and it is a matter of prestige. And the Germans will try occupy at any cost. But if Hitler send von Leeb... another significant reinforcement? All Hitler's scheduled dates to occupy Leningrad have expired. But this is the time factor; the Germans need to dictate their rapid progress towards Moscow, the winter is approaching. The attack is a purely a military side of it all. There is another, one no less importantly - political. The fact is, whether the Germans will be able to to occupy Moscow or not depends on many things. From the behaviour of our allies, and the situation in Turkey. The behaviour of our allies rise additional issues. In short, for Hitler, he needs Moscow at any cost. And if so, you dare not remove troops from the direction of Moscow. - I trust that. - Well, that makes sense. Logical. Fegyunininsky was. How are things at Pulkovo? Yes! Has confirmation been received? Leave those fucking codes behind! How many soldiers and tanks did you get? Yes. Did the militia finish their work? All right. Watch the wings, do you understand? In particular, towards Uritsk, don't ignore it! The slightest change, immediately let me know! Even the smallest! Let me know! - I'm sure von Leeb is going for a detour! - A detour? At the height of the centre of Pulkovo, Andrej Alexandrovich. - Why did you decide that? - Therefore, look! From here, south of Pulkovo along the Gulf of Finland, there are steel cross obstacles. This is where we used to repel attacks. von Leeb thinks so too. That's why he goes around, in a south-westerly direction. Kolya! - Come on! - Got it! Do you think it would be that simple? To figure out something big, to fight the Russian peasants, the Germans probably consider that it is below their dignity. Let's say, "Everyone gets what they deserve." And to figure out something special, they no longer have time for that. Mikhail Semyonovich, come here. They have written an order to immediately counter-attack Armeniansky, in the event of the Germans withdraw from the territory of Finskoya-Kojrovo. Avoiding the hills. This is one of them. Second, get in touch with Novikov and warn them that an air strike is expected imminently by mass bombing in that area. Third. Tell the gunners of the Baltic Fleet, to be ready for the closing fire. - Do you understand? - I understood. Take Action! Georgiy Konstantinovich, Fegyunininsky reported something new, which would strengthen your idea? No, it's still quiet. Then, why do you think the Germans avoid the heights? They will be avoided, Andrej Alexandrovich. von Leeb would not be von Leeb, if you didn't get out. The smell of this dust, I can understand it from afar. I'm going to headquarters. Zhdanov. Has Zhukov taken his command? Comrade Stalin, Zhukov went to headquarters. I'll switch to the apparatus. Not necessary. What happened on the front? There is nothing special, Comrade Stalin. If it doesn't matter that the Germans have... since two hours ago, constantly been firing at and bombing the city. You have to... do your best, and impossible. Not only to protect Peter, but shackle the enemy's northern group. We will continue to help you, as far as we can. The staff decided today to reclassify your front, as an assault regiment. An order was issued to activate the 54th Army. I understand that all this is little, but more than that he couldn't do it now. I understand. We do our duty, Comrade Stalin. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Be worthy heroes, who know how to fight for the Homeland, with honour and fidelity. Who knows how to keep alive in the midst of fire, torment, and tribulation. Forward, comrades! Forward, youth! V. V. Vishnyevsky speaks. Leningradians ahead! Remember whose name this great city bears, to the unshakable V. I. Lenin. Attack with all your might! We will win! It has to be! And we will win! Battalion, attention! Left face! To the defeat of the fascist invaders, in defence of our home town - step in, get started! Well, he spoke well, the Battalion Commander. We've always talked about - "He's behind us Leningrad", "Behind us is Leningrad", Now you can see, this he is behind us. Our job is not just to let the fascists get here, but at the first opportunity, launch a counter-attack. - I think that's understandable to everyone. - Understandable, if not for the first time. How-how, not for the first time? Have you been here yet? This elevation used to seem closer. Twenty years ago. - How about twenty years ago? - Wait a minute, Captain. According to them, they fought here against the Juggernauts? Right here. And we got him out of here. But young people, understandably, don't remember that. I even kept a document. "Fight to the last drop of blood, comrades." "Keep every foot of land." "Hold on to the end! The victory will be ours!" - This is Lenin's call. - Yes. - "Lenin." - Don't lose it. - Every soldier should see this. - I keep it in my party book. I will never lose my party book. The battle for Leningrad. the moment of the final has come, when the enemy deployed everything. There were deadly clashes everywhere, had to decide what would be stronger: the aggressive enthusiasm of Hitler's soldiers, who are a few kilometres from their destination, or the defending Soviet soldiers' endurance and hardness, who defended and were the last line of defence for their home town. Comrade Battalion Commander! Go ahead. Roger that! - Gorelov! - I get it. Then, wait, I'll start. Third century! For the homeland! For the city of Lenin! Hurray! - The... the height? - We defended it, Ignatics. We defended it. The height is ours. As it was, ours. So, even now. Comrade Commander, repulsed by another attack. But from Finskoye-Koryovo, the wind brings smoke towards us. What did I say? It is now clear that they want to avoid the heights under the guise of smoke. Command the artillery immediately, fire at them before Kiskina or they would reach Finskoye-Korjovo! The Kronstadtians will help you and the Air Force as well. If you let the Germans break through, there is no place left for us in this world! Comrade General Army, A. A. Novikov the commander of the Air Force, reports. My pilots reported burning lorries in the district of Finskoye-Kojrovo. Tanks, shattered cannons and panicked fleeing German infantry. Well. My Führer, nothing about St. Petersburg I can't say reassurance. von Leeb's soldiers continued the fierce fighting. The Russians changed their tactics. They take every opportunity to counter-attack. Your opinion? I know about your faithful soldiers, they always want to hear the truth. That's why I think von Leeb can't cope with the task entrusted to him. Aged. And, as it turned out, he was weak, but I don't see the need to replace him. Every commander clings to his men, as are you, My Führer, when you appointed von Bock. All this makes it very difficult for our main forces concentration in the direction of Moscow. Deprived of my victory! And, you, Halder, speak in a voice as if nothing had happened. To stand on the tram of Leningrad to see the city through binoculars. They had the opportunity to capture their weapons, but they didn't! I held two armies for three months in the north-east. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers, tanks, an entire fleet! During which my divisions in Smolensk were bleeding. I ask you: Why? Because of who? I should have been in St. Petersburg a month ago. And now in Moscow! My Führer, I suggest you immediately leave the idea of taking St. Petersburg. We will need tens of thousands of German soldiers, to occupy Moscow. We can finishing our work in St. Petersburg with famine, artillery, blockade! But we do not accept any submission! No white flag! Comrade Commander, our intelligence reported: in the Luga region, direction Pskov a motorised infantry column with tanks was seen. Are they leaving Leningrad? Do you understand what you're saying? Or your intelligence is lying! Or the information of the enemy come from your agents! No, Comrade Commander. I know my people well. I have no doubt what they saw. No, no, I have to, check again! A mistake can cost us a lot! Georgiy Konstantinovich, in fact, it may be true. They ran out of time and power. Their next step is Moscow. Message to Comrade Stalin! Good afternoon! Good health! Report... The enemy made repeated attempts To occupy Leningrad... ... unsuccessfully. The enemy has suffered huge losses. And to occupy the city now... ... unable. At Leningrad, the front has stabilised. I have a question for you. You could get a machine and fly to Moscow? Headquarters would like to consult with you about necessary measures. On the left flank of the reserve front complications arose... I want your permission... ... for an early flight tomorrow morning... the 6th of October. All right. We look forward to seeing you in Moscow tomorrow. The End of the Second Film
