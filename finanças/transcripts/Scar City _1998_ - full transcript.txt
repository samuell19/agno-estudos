[music playing] Hey, how's it going? It isn't. Can't even find a parking summons. You want some coffee? Sure, thanks. How'd you end up in a shit post like this? They say it's for my owngood until the shooting review board is done with me. How's that going? IAD has a hard on for me. It's my third shoot this year.- Third? Slow year, huh? RADIO: Charlie 7, pickupa complaint for a robbery. 1 Charlie 7, three minutes out. See you later, Rambo. We have to do some crimefighting. I'm going to walk tothe other end of my block. There's an alley I'm dying to check out. [sirens] [angry chatter] Just give me the stuff. Shit. Police! Don't move! [gunshots] Keep your hands out of your pockets. Shit. Take it easy. Foot post seven to central. RADIO: Seven, go. I have an officer involvedshooting in the alley between Remsen and Mountain. I need a bus for one male perp down. Calm down, there's an ambulance on the way. Calm down, my ass. You just shot me. Where's your gun? Where's your fucking gun? Stupid fuck. He says, that's OK. He says, that's OK, honey, do you have a dentist appointment too? We heard it was traced. It was. He capped the dealer, DOA. Was it clean? Not hardly, dealer put his hand in his coat. But there was no gun. By the time Chase knew that, he had already put three in his chest. Sometimes these things justfall into your lap, don't they? - Hey, what's up? - Not much. OK if I take a look? He's not going anywhere. Ugly motherfucker. Looks like dead didn't help him too much, huh? You looking for something? Tattoos. Sometimes these hamsters,they tattoo their rap sheets to their hands. Thanks, guys. How you doing, detective? Lieutenant Devens, Select Crimes. Sir? I'd like to speak to theofficer privately for a moment. Sir, you know that-- You're not going to citethe manual of procedures, are you detective? I studied that for the lieutenant's exam. Apparently I passed, and you didn't. Yes, sir. You seemed pretty composed, officer. I got low blood pressure. Your fourth shooting in 12months with the review board still pending? I say you have no blood pressure. You realize that the shaky shoot is just what the job is looking for, one good excuse to terminate you. Shit, if someone wanted to be vindictive enough, they could indict you for this. I've been advised to wait for legal and union representation beforeanswering any questions, sir. I'm not from Internal Affairs. And I don't have any questions. How's the investigation come along? Very interesting. We found the perp's bunbehind one of the dryers, must have hit the floor and skidded. Really? Good, keep me posted. I don't know about this. You acted in good faith. You think you should go to jail, lose a career, because some mope stuck his hand in his jacket? You're talking about evidence tampering. I'm talking about a contract. What's my end? I cut an order, you'rein my unit by next Monday. Why me? You can shoot a man, go home, go to bed, get up, and shoot another one. Not everybody has that ability, John. Not every cop has that ability. You want me to shoot people? Not exactly. The scar squad goes afterthe most dangerous perps in this city, the ones thatwould rather kill a cop than go to jail. In order to take these people off the street, sometimes we have to use deadly force. The chief, the mayor, the district attorney, all understand that. In fact, in our case, they sanction it. No review boards, no grand juries. No thanks. OK. Let me tell you the way thisis really going to go down. I can make that gun disappearas fast as I made it found. You will be indicted. You will go to jail. And your fucking life will be over. It's your choice. All right, we're covering two spots for the bookstore keepers. So things are going to be spread a little thin. Speedy and Forest, you have the Fantasy Shop on Southern Boulevard. Sergeant Credey and Zairewill be in the response car posting relief. Yeah, when they aren't parked. Too bad nobody wants yourmouth anywhere near that cop. All right, the U Store is Bobby and Janice. I'm going to make a woman out of you yet. What the hell is that? Trace, you're in the car with me. I got 50 says we take this out. I'm in. Come on, Swifty. I want some of that. Listen, conduct your unlawfulbetting after roll call. And don't forget to sign off for the shotguns. There'll be no more hunting trips with the department's approval. Now, Lou, I was justfield testing the artillery. Yeah, all right. Everybody fall out, take your post. You got $50 I could borrow? You mean for the beatingyou gave me last week? The what? Hey, Dick Tracy? Trace. Yeah, whatever, sign out oneof these, and a box of shells. I'm sorry about that. Don't expect to be holding it. Lou loves his shotgun. Janice? You will have a good time today. Guaranteed mayhem when you ride with the Lou. Just don't get between him and the perps. Yeah, right, like Brendan. Who's Brendan? Brendan was working the cashregister at this liquor store, right, Braintree Liquors? Couple of mopes walk in with nines. Devon is behind the window. Brendan is behind the cash register. Brendan was a little bit slow getting down. It was just somebuckshot in the shoulder. I don't know. Lou never liked Brendan much. He used to call him the hemorrhoid, remember? Bobby, got the car keys? Oh yeah. Let's get going. Here, you drive. I'll take that. Let's go. Thanks a lot, have a nice day. Who says police work doesn't prepare you for a competitive job in the private sector? Devin won't let you run the register because you can't count. No, they just don't trust you in the back with all these magazines,wouldn't get your pants on in time to shoot anyone. New guy is relieving me. One hand or two? Fuck this anyway, coupleof niggas don't rob her soon, I'm gonna. Let me guess, you're the token Democrat. OK, Janice, these guys look good. I say we just cut to the chase, pop these smokes right now. Why don't we go crazy andwait till they do something? Like that? All right, Janice, we get at least one gun. Looks like they're clearing out the store. This is a the fucking stick up! Open the fucking register! No problem, bro. Come on! Put the shit in the back! Come on! Come on, Skee, handle this bitch! You want the coins? Do I want the coins? You never been robbed before? Just give me the damn paper. Hurry the hell up! Thanks. Hey man, you forgot something. What? [gunshots] He's not a perp! Police! No shit. You're not going to make it over that wall before I put a bullet in your ass, pal. OK, officer, you've got a point. Come down off the wall, slowly. John, you got to pick up the pace. The fuck was that? The conclusion of a gunbattle with five armed felons. You guys sure do things alot differently around here. Go inside and check on the other perps. I will. If I see any of them twitching, I'll be sure to put a bulletin the back of their head. You might want to rethink your strategy. So far, so good. That was your last life. This one has no rules. [sirens] [piano music] [SINGING] Morning low, sweet man, I love him so, though he's mean as can be. He's a kind of man needs a kind of woman like me. Gonna die a sweet man should pass me by. If I die, will it be? He's a kind of man needs a kind of woman like me. Don't know any reason whyhe treats me so poorly. What have I gone and done? Makes my troubles double with his worries. I ain't deserving of none. Hey! Show us your tits! Show us yours. From now on, don't startsinging until they're too drunk to complain. Or maybe you can gimmick it up a little bit, or make it just a little more exotic. Exotic? What am I a fucking fish? Stripping and singing, it's too confusing. There's a low threshold forconfusion out there, Paul. You took a shot. If you weren't in such greatdemand for other stuff, I never would have gave you that. Speaking of which, got something for you. What? A party tomorrow, $5,000 for the night. Unless you're at CarnegieHall or something. Fuck you, Paul. What kind of people? Drug dealers again. These are OK guys. It's for Sam. It's always for Sam. Sam doesn't have to wrestle with a bunch of stoned Dominicanstrying to stick their dicks in the wrong places. These are Bolivians. Hope you won't think any less of me if I can't see the difference. Come on, baby. Sam wants my best girls. You're supposed to charm me, right, Paul? Who's the escort? Tito. He stays the whole time? I'll tell him to. 75. Come on. Last time I had bruises for two weeks. Besides, I can smell your desperation even under that cologne. 75. You're killing my commission. I'm sure you make it up somewhere. Nice shoot, fuck. Thank you. Dan, you want a ride? Yeah. Yeah, I'll take one. Nice job, Trace. Some more work for you. Some windows too. Do you know the perp mortalityrate for this unit is 100%? That's quite a statistic. And a well-documented one. How do you think we managedto kill all these perps and never even raise an eyebrow? Good PR. Nobody gives a shit. Look at their rap sheets, John. They're career criminals. When we kill shitheads like those, their mothers are a little relieved. That's a great motto, Lou. Were doing it for their mothers. Oh, John, every member ofthis unit was handpicked by me. I know you're capable of doing the job, and doing it correctly. Does that include coveringour tracks at any cost? You didn't have a problem withcovering your tracks last week. That was different. Oh, really? How do you figure? I like you, John. I really do. You're a pain in the ass. But I know where you're coming from. You'll stab me in the chestbefore you stab me in the back. I'll make note of your preference, Lou. Yeah, you do that. So, I heard you stoodup for the brothers today. Well, don't take it too personally. Hey man, fuck it. It's about time somebody gave Bobby a shot. His nature is too noble for the world. Excuse me? Shakespeare, it's pretty sweet, huh? [grunting] You're not on patrol anymore, Dick Tracy. You're part of a team now. All feelings aside, Trace,when Bobby makes a fucking play, you better move. No one fucks with a good thing, John. This is stupid. Watch this. Take it. [phone ringing] Yeah? Sam needs you for tonight. Oh, shit, I forgot about that. Well, give me your address. And I'll have Tito pick you up. No, I'll see you at the club in a couple hours. How many is a couple? A couple is two, Paul. A nice couple, a railroad coupling. Cute. Guests of Mr. Bandusky's. All right, go ahead. Let them go. Jesus, I know better than this. Come on, Candy, it's just a gig. Gig, my ass. You've obviously neverwrestled with a drunk, stoned, horny Dominican. These guys are Bolivians. They're drug dealers. So? So they'll try to push cokeup your nose the first half of the night, something else somewhere it doesn't belong the other half. If I scream, you better hit someone. No, you better just shoot someone. It's important that thefirst move happen quickly. You understand I have creditors. Ted can take care of it tonight. Some guests of Mr. Bandusky's are here. Yes, some young ladieswho are anxious to meet you. I thought an introduction might be appropriate, in view of our developing business relationship. Have them come in. Rafael Soto, Faith, Georgie, Candy. Pleasure. Ted? I got to go. I got to tell the boss. See you in my office tomorrow afternoon. OK, Sammy. Ted's got someplace to go. So you're going to give me a ride home. Sir, I'm supposed to-- yes, sir. We obtained a warrant on Rafael Soto. I thought we didn't do drug dealers. He's running an angle onkidnapping and armed robbery. The powers that be want a message sent. The warrant itself, of course,is pretty much bullshit. I guess we're just goingto have to light him up. We'll hit them at dawn,when they're good and sleepy. There'll be guards and lots of guns, all right? Everyone in the house is assumed to be a perp, I mean everyone, and shouldbe treated accordingly. Sergeant Credey here willpass out the assignments. Any questions? All right, we move out at 0300. You heard the man. Let's get a move on, people. Fucking dawn raids, huh? I hate getting to work before the bars close. Know what I mean, John? John? You know what I mean? I heard you guys had a littletarget practice last night. I'm sorry I missed it. Me too. Now, hey, listen, it's justa little initiation, John, OK? Brings you into the unit. It made me feel all warm and fluffy inside. Hey, fellas, we're taking a little pool on who scalps Soto, $50 a pop. Who's in? I'm in. What about it, John? You in? What a lovely neighborhood. Beautiful day. Too bad we have to wreck it today. Excuse me, sir, we're looking for the access road for the interstate. Well, this looks like a very interesting-- Excuse me! [gunshots] What the fuck is going on? It came from the front. What's that shit on your face? [gunshots] Where the fuck are you guys? We're right here. [gunshots] Team one has the front secured. Team two owns the back. Sweep the house. We'll secure the outside. Where are all the cops when you need them? Wait! Back off, you motherfuckers,if you so much as move. [gunshots] All right, let's clear out the house. Bobby, John, Forest, take the upstairs. Janice, Speedy, take the basement. Zero, you got the ground floor with me. Remember, these fuckers know you are here now. If they have not surrendered yet, they're probably waitingto put a cap in your ass. [gunshots] God damn mother fucking. [gunshots] Fuck. All right, we're clear. We're clear. That one's Soto. Looks like you won the pool, Trace. Upstairs is secure? Gentlemen, we have the house. Devon's calling it in. Fire it up, boys. On a sunny day like this,these mother fuckers are going to start stinking real fast. Let's go down to the kitchen before Zero drinks all the beer. Are we having a moment? I'll be down in a minute. Fucking guy hasn't got any stomach. Get dressed. My clothes are in the bathroom. You're in a closet. Pick anything. These are men's clothes. There, that's you. Stay right here until I come back and get you. Let's go. We're going to go down the hall very slowly. If I wave you back, that meansyou duck into the closest room. You can't slice those motherfuckers. But what about protein? I want to get something Ican bulk up a little bit. Fuck protein, drink a shake. Good job of hiding. I was just talking to thisguy a couple of hours ago. Anyone you were talking to a couple of hours ago looks pretty much the same. I was with two other women. Sorry. Jesus, but you guys are cops. Can you climb? What? There's a trellis outsidethe bathroom window. Can you climb? I don't have any shoes. A few splinters between your toes is going to be the least of your problems. If you make it halfway down the wall, you can jump the rest of the way. Are you kidding me? These guys catch me,they're going to kill me. You will definitely be killed. So you're going to go to the window, climb outside, go down thewall, run across the yard, and disappear. - Now? Yes, now. How many people do you see? Two. When I start shooting, they should come inside. That's when you go. What if they stay outside? Hope they don't look up. Shit, I can't believe this is happening. You ready? Sure, I'm looking forward to it. [gunshots] What happened? This one was still alive. We had a walking dead here, Lou. Trace put him back down. Everybody relax, we got it under control. Trace? Fucker was on his feet,halfway out the door, Lou. That is fucking bullshit. He was dead when I capped him. Then I guess I shot a zombie. Yeah, well, there's not muchof him left to go anywhere now. Jittery motherfucker. Man, that happened to me once. Asshole just didn't want to die. Paramedics almost saved his ass. No, no, I don't think he's going to last. Devin's starting to give himthat look he gave Brendan. Here he is. Hey, I thought I saw oneof those guys twitching. You want to check it out for me. You're just jealous because I won the pool. Rookie luck. All that means is thatyou've got to buy the beer. Speaking of which. You ought to check out the kitchen. There's a whole banquet in there. See, that's why I like hittingthe drug lords, better chow. You coming? You'll know when I am. You need to lower your profile, John. Devin doesn't have a lot of patience with fuck ups or problems. Which one am I? That's free advice. You get what you pay for. Let's go. Go. Trace! You out here? Hey, Trace! Over here, Sergeant. Crime scene will beout here in five minutes. Devin wants everyone out here and back to the office for a debriefing.- Right. Get a move on. So Speedy goes, oh, oh, oh, hey, Bobby. I think that one guy-- I think that one guy was a cop. What are you thinking? I'm like, I don't fucking no. I was being polite. I was-- what are we going to goback and pull out the bullets? No. I don't know. [chatter] [laughter] Show us how you talk, man! Hey, come on, how's your chest? I don't fucking talk like that. I got bitched out by the chief today. You want to know why? Why? Not for shooting 12 peopleand losing two hostages, but for banging up four cars this month. They're not counting bodies. They're counting dents, you see? No, I don't. Some hooker watches us waste a drug dealer, and complains as a matter of policy. The unit gets crippled becauseof a bullshit investigation the mayor doesn't wantto authorize, but has to. I'll put the lives of two whores on the amount of good we did here today. Apparently you did, Lou. I thought you'd makean easier fit here, John. Transfer me back to patrol. Chief won't go for that. Here, you're under control. There's no telling what you'll say out there. So then I guess you'll have to kill me too. Dead cops are too public. Of course, I'm not totallydiscounting the idea. Thought you liked mebecause I was a chest stabber. I've never given you my back, John. So where does that leave us? I'm a chest stabber too. You'll see me coming. Is Paul here? He's in the office. It's all here. It's all right. You fucking scumbag. Jesus, Candy-- I just called your apartment. Get him out of here. Give us a couple of minutes, will you? Nice to see you too. You set me up. That's right, Candy. I figured it was the best way to get rid of three of my employees. This way, I could open theirlockers and sell their pasties. Then Sam set us up. Sam called me the minuteit broke in the news. He was shitting a brick. He thought it was going to come back on us. He even asked me to get Tito out of town. No, that's bullshit. He took Tito with him. He knew. You'd think he would have left three girls there if he knew the copswere going to serve a warrant? It wasn't a warrant, Paul. It was a fucking hit. They killed everybody in the house. They would have killed me too. The news said it was cops. They were cops. Yeah, this is Paul at Treasure Chest. Get me Sam. I don't care what he's doing, moron. Get him. Sam? I got Candy right here in front of me. Yeah, OK. He'll be here in 30 minutes. Happy now? Sure, Paul, I'm ecstatic. So this cop snuck you out ofthere past all the other cops and let you go, but you don't know why? I didn't ask. He just told me that they're supposed to kill everyone in the house. Do you think they expectedme to be in that house? Did he give you his name? No. Did he ask you yours? No. Did you leave anything there that can lead them back to you, a purse, a wallet? I never take a purse on a trick. My clothes were in the bathroom. I still don't understandwhy this cop let you go. It doesn't make any sense. Faith and Georgia, they're both dead. We're sure of that, right, Sam? Yes, Paul, we're sure of that. Cops don't behave like this. Papers said it was theScar Unit, same guys who shot up the Duke crew last year. Do we have a sympathetic ear with these guys? No, but I know someone who does. Well, get your someoneto put me in with the boss. This might be a bad coincidence. Or we may have an issue to address. So you want to get out of town? Hell yeah. One day, I'm doing businesswith these Bolivians. And the next day, the copskill every fucking one of them. Do you have a place for her to cool her jets for a couple of days? Oh yeah, I got a crash pad in the back. OK, you stay here until I get this sorted out. Whatever needs to be done,I'll take care of it. Paul will have Tito keep an eye on you. You'll be safe, as long asyou don't leave the club. Thanks, Sam. It's OK, sweetheart. It's just good business. You can't hold on to good helpif you let them all get killed. Listen up, it's last call. Can I get you another? I'm not done with this one. I know. There's a two drink minimum. Oh, that's what the big, red,two drink minimum sign meant. [SINGING] I called ouryour name in a misty dream last night, saw that old smile that I missed. Ready for that drink, hot shot? I'd like to meet her. Tell me this isn't that kind of place. I'll get you another Coke. [SINGING] As real as all those tears I cried, because my poor heart aches each time I wait, knowing that you're not here. But what can i do? So, you ready to leave? I don't think so. The bartender just took my 20. Let's try it again. You ready to leave? Refresh my memory. What did I do? We have a low tolerance for pervs and flakes. I guess you don't get alot of those kinds in here. OK. Let's go. Think very carefully aboutyour next move, big guy. You on official business, officer? Maybe I'm looking for a special friend. What's your best guess? My best guess is you're a drunk, off duty cop about 10 seconds awayfrom embarrassing himself in a titty bar. Come back another time. I'll buy you a drink. You know, when you put it thatway, you make a lot of sense. Oh, don't forget your 20. Appreciate your timethis morning, Lieutenant. Well, I've been asked to extend you every reasonable courtesy, Mr. Bandusky. Sam. What can I do for you, Sam? I read in the papers about Rafael Soto. You and everybody else. I was wondering if wecan expect to see that kind of thing happening more often. Well, Rafael Soto was a publicly violent man. I like to think we all sleep a little better knowing that he's notshooting up the town anymore. Well, I'd sleep a little better knowing you weren't going to be waking me up one of these mornings. Where does this sudden concern stem from, Sam? The girls who were killed in Soto's mansion were acquaintances of mine. And it occurred to me that-- Sam, Scar is a selected crime unit. We only target chronic, violent offenders. We wouldn't be having this conversation if I thought you fit that profile. I'm sorry about your girls. But it was an accident, not a message. OK, you do know that oneof them made it out alive, don't you? In fact, one of your cops snuck her out. He came around my clublooking for her about three this morning, probablylooking for a gratitude fuck. Did he find her? My guys follow orders. I realize she could be potentially damaging to your unit. And I was wondering what youmight want to do about that. You're not trying toshake me down, are you, Sam? I'm not looking for that kindof relationship, Lieutenant. We're in a position to do a lot for each other. We are? Oh yeah, you said so yourself. You're not looking for guyslike me, who do their business quietly, relatively peacefully. You're looking for thepsychos and the scumbags. I'm 100% behind you. I am in a position to send youin the right direction looking for those kind of people. Really? We're cops, not assassins. I'm finding a moral and professional common ground, which bringsme back to this girl I have. Obviously, Sam, I wouldrather she didn't surface. That's all you need to say, Lieutenant. So what's the story? We got a bullshit anonymoustip on some joker name Larry Strode. Since he's number three on our shit list, Devon wants us to check it out. Another jerk off wasting my time. Check the back, let'sget the fuck out of here. [gunshots] Shit! What are we shooting? [gunshots] John, where you going? Huh? [gunshots] Where you going, John? [gunshots] How's Zero? Pretty fucking dead, Sarge! That's fucking great. That's fucking great! Hey, John! You know you killed Zero, right? It seemed like the appropriate response to a fucking shotgun in my face! You killed a cop. You've got a big fucking problem now, John. I can't wait to hear your solution, Sarge. Well, you know you called it. Why don't you come in here and get me? Half the job is going to be here in three, four minutes, John. Be a real shame if they took me alive, huh? No big deal to me, John,baby, with your record and our testimony, try tofigure out how you're going to stay the fuck out of jail. Me, personally, I'd ratherdie than go to jail, man. Let me get this straight. You want me to let you kill me, is that it? It would be clean, lineof duty, a hero's funeral, and your family would collect a pension. You're out of your fucking mind, Sarge! The whole bunch of you areliving in your own world. Yeah, we are. That's right. But you think of the alternative. You'll be disgraced the public and raped in prison for the rest of your fucking life. I know what I'd do. I bet you do, Sarge. [gunshots] Move it! Son of a bitch! Fuck. Come on, Sam, you told her. No, I'm not. OK, OK, but look, I'm justgoing to tell you something. It's your call. And what you're doing is wrong. No, I'm not-- I'm not saying that. OK, OK, I'll tell Tito to go along. Fucking Sam, he ain't happygetting two of my girls shot. Go along where? He's sending someone to pick up Candy. I mean, he must think that I take an ad out in the newspaper to hire quality pussy off the street. I am not going to kill her, Paul. She gave me a Christmas present. You don't have to do shit. Just take the ride. Why? Because I'm fucking telling you to. That's why. She trusts you. Just tell her that Sam wants to see her. She doesn't have to know she's getting popped, till it happens. You're a compassionate guy, Paul. Tito this, Tito that, move to Florida. Candy, Sam wants to see you. You have any idea what's going on? No. Ready to buy me that drink now? Hello again, put together a bag,whatever you think you'll need. You got a car? Not here. What does he drive? A Lincoln. What half ass gangster doesn't? Keys. Fuck you. Before you dust off your brain and start getting any smart ideas, you ought to know I killed a cop 45 minutes ago. So popping a bouncer with a bad attitude is a short step backward. Can I ask you something? My boss and your boss exchanged stories. Then they decided to kill us both. Tito here was going to holdyour hand until they found a good place to dump your body. I gave you a Christmas present. He's a fucking nut job. Trust me or you don't. Either way, I'm going to keep you alive. Keys. Come out of your pocket with anything bigger than your naked lady key chain, we're going to have the shortestargument on record. My apologies, she's wearing a bikini. [grunting] Everybody stop! Thanks. We'll finish this later. You've got to be kidding me. You know where he parks his car. Out back. Good. Turn around, Tito. Oh! Man, you better not be a nut job. Let's go. Were you telling me thetruth about Tito and Sam? You're a few minutes slow with that question. Oh shit. We should go? Yeah, they're the Farrel Brothers. They work for Sam. They must be here for me. Can they recognize you? Ted just did. Shit. OK, of course, Tito didn't gofor his periodic maintenance check.Are they getting out of the car? Ted is. Do me a favor, please? Put your head down. What? Get down, now! [gunshots] You shoot and I'll start the car! OK! [gunshots] I'm gonna run out of bullets soon! It's not my car! OK, got it! Get us the hell out of here! Jesus! I haven't driven in a while. Put the gear shift to the letter D and we'll move forward! Ha ha. [gunshots] He's still with us. How am I supposed to lose him? I don't know, You knew D made us go forward. [gunshots] Eyes on the road, Allison! How did you know-- It's on your rap sheet, nicer name than Candy. You must be Officer Friendly. [gunshots] I thought you didn't know how to drive. I said I hadn't driven in a while. [gunshots] Killed him, didn't I? No, I think he should be OK. You think? Look, you did what you had to do. We got to ditch this car,find a safe place to sit down, relax, and think about whatour next move is going to be. Our next move? You mean this is as far as your planned? I had a shootout with the police this morning. Then I had to rescue youfrom the mob this afternoon. It's been a busy day. I'm not going to be ableto relax and put myself in your hands, am I, Friendly? Unbe-- fucking-- lievable. I sent a couple of uniformsover to his apartment. I don't think he's that stupid. So where else we going to find him? He's a deranged cop killerwith a city on his back. He's got to turn up. He already has, Lou. He just abducted a stripper froma titty bar called the Treasure Chest in the Fourth District. He killed one guy in the parking lot, and another one during the car chase. They get him? Uh-uh, he ditched the car about a mile away. There's an alert out for him now. Definitely traced? Yeah, one of the respondingdetectives played a hunch and showed his photo. Fuck! That's got to be the whorehe cut loose from Soto's place. You think he's trying to make a move on us? He's got nothing to lose. You send Speedy and Forestover to the tit bar. Maybe they can come up withan address on the pros. I'm out. Get all those things put together, OK? Come on. Come on, these are all legs and feet. Come on, give me some heads, all right? Jesus, the last legitimatebusiness, I'm going to-- yeah? You hear the news? I thought you were goingto handle your guy, Devon. I thought you weregoing to kill that hooker. Looks like we're both shooting blanks today. Listen, I just sent acouple of cops over there. You give them anything they ask for. Are you hitting me up for freebies? Information, Sam, give them information. You know something, Devon, I'min bend with you for six hours. And I don't like it already. Well, you like it a lot less if you try to roll out on me now. Listen, hook up with Bobby,and go toss Trace's apartment. Maybe we can figure out where he goes. I wasn't expecting him to dodge a point like shotgun blast. Zero must have moved up too fast. I like that, Janice. Blame it on the dead guy. Is this a safe place? Safe for a little while. I keep an apartment downtown. This mortgage isn't in my name. And neither is the phone bill. For professional purposes? For it's nobody'sfucking business purposes. Nice old car. New old car, '59 Corvetteconvertible with factory miles. I guess that thing you do pays pretty well. Too well. Can you park this babyon the street around here without it being stolen or towed? This is a good neighborhood. Good, you should park it outaround the back of the house, somewhere around the block. Why? Well, one, it'll look like we're not here. And, two, if we have to get away quick, we can just go through the backyard. Oh, good idea. Go with it. I'm going to take a shower. Where's all the doors? They're being refinished. I thought it might besome kind of a statement. No, no statement. There's probably enough hotwater left if you shower fast. That would be great. But I don't think I'm goingto fit into any of your stuff. I could find you my dad's stuff. You look about his size. Does he live here? He did. This is my inheritance, bad wiring and all. And it's Ali. The only time I ever hearAllison is right after, will the defendant please rise? Janice, please tell meyou called Zero's family. I did. Let's get a move on, people. When I get that call, we're out. Forest, for the last time,get the fuck off my desk. Fuck you, you piece of shit. Yes, sir? Yeah, OK, yeah, I'll callthe mayor and fill him in. All right, yeah. Fucking chief, now I got to hold his hand through this whole butt fuck operation! Zero's dead ass alreadymakes this a god damn parade. Where are we? We're working on it. Don't work on it, Sergeant, fucking do it. If some sector cop picks them up, it's going to be a bitch to get them killed. What about the district attorney? Scar is sanctioned allthe way up the department's chain of command, and the mayor's office. Could go as far as the governor. Then the feds. Assuming they're interested. We have a less than believable story. You're a cop. That's got to count for something. I killed another cop. That counts for a lot more. Do you have any ideas of your own? Or are you just happyenough shooting down mine? The police academy was a little sketchy about a situation like this one. You wouldn't happen to havea couple of boxes of bullets lying around, would you? No, but I do have a gun. A pearl handle 25 would havebeen a little more ladylike. My father was in the army. Does it work? Sure, I shoot squirrels on Sunday mornings. TV: Police tonight are searchingfor rogue police officer John Trace, and alleged prostituteAllison Cheney in connection with the slaying of policeofficer Tom Zerotelly earlier today. Zerotelly was killed in ablazing gun battle, the cause of which is still unknown. How did I get involved in shooting a cop? Devon's very thorough. What if we called the newspapers? We'd have to back it up by turning ourselves in. And that's if Devon doesn't get to us first. Then there's your boss. He's trying to kill us too. You hungry? I got some macaroni and cheese. Why don't you go into the living room and see if I still have a bottle of wine left in that liquor cabinet? You know I spent $200on that dining room table. I'd like to keep it dark in here, since you don't have any curtains up. It's a work in progress. I figure I have another two orthree years before I move in. Is that why you-- Entertain? For the money, early retirement? Pretty much. Why? I don't know. I-- I was wondering-- How I got started? Probably as boring a storyas why you became a cop, just kind of fall into ajob I guess, circumstances. I have some money thatisn't tied into the house. We could go to my bank, get the cash, and drive out of town tomorrow. The idea of spending therest of my life a wanted killer doesn't sound particularly appealing. John, we are wanted killers. Nothing we do is going to change that now. We're in the neighborhoodof nothing left to lose. We'll have to move at sunrise. You take the back bedroomthat faces the yard. I'll stay in the living room. Keep some clothes on, in casewe have to leave in a hurry. Why don't we go crazy and share the bed? I've had the benefit ofyour professional expertise. Lease I can do is return the favor. I'm not going to beg or anything, John. But I might get killed tonight,or tomorrow, or real soon. And I don't want my lastlover to have been a trick. [gunshots] Oh shit. Are you hit? Keep your head down. If you see one of those red dots, stay the hell away from it. It's a laser sight! [gunshots] Friends of yours? Acquaintances. Got any ideas? I think we're going to be safer in the hallway. Can you shoot? Pull the trigger. You ready? Sure. Let's go. [gunshots] Shit! [gunshots] Stay down! You OK? All right, if we don't make a move soon, they're going to hit the house. I'd rather deal with themout there than in here. You got a lighter? No, oh wait, in mymakeup bag in the bathroom. OK, great, stay right there. [gunshots] John? I'm OK! Watch out. What the hell are you doing? Giving them something to think about. Like, why did we light ourselves on fire? Come on. Let's go light up the living room. This is my house, you know? You want to renovate it or be buried in it? [gunshots] So we're in a burning housewith the cops waiting outside. What's phase three? We wait and see who comes in for us. [gunshots] You think you could make it to the kitchen? I just avoid the red lights, right? You got it. You ready? Yeah. OK. [gunshots] Son of a bitch! God, you're hit. Shit. OK, OK. We're going out through that door. I want you to stay right behind me. You got the keys to the car? Yeah. When we get to the car, start it up. If I'm not with you, take off without me. I'm not going to do that. I'm not planning on sacrifice myself. Neither should you. You ready? It's always about sex with you, isn't it? Let's go. [gunshots] Fucking bitch! Come on, Trace! We just want to talk! [gunshots] Go! Go! Go! How's the shoulder? It's bleeding. There's a bandanna in the glove compartment. Do we need to find a doctor? No, we need to find amotel, something low key. Do you know any? I left my prostitutes guide to sleazy motels back at the house. Also a drug store. And I need more ammo. More ammo? You know, since we've met, you've got me framed for murder, marked for death by the mob and the police,burnt down my house, and bled all of my new car. What do you do on a second date? This is our second date. On our first date, I saved your life. I don't want reporters getting through. That's real important. Got that? Make sure you hear whatI'm saying, no reporters. Bobby's down too. How bad/ Picking his brains outof the fucking dandelions. Forest got a make on the car, but no plate. You check hard on the whore. See if you can come up with something, a mother, a brother, anything. He went through our guys like a fucking chainsaw. He second guessed our tactics. I guess we misread him. His loyalty, not his talent. I saw that in his eyes. Nights like these make ittough to recruit replacements, don't it? Replacing them ain't hard, Sarge. It's training them. I wish I could train themto do what he just did. This was fucking beautiful. Keep an eye on Annie. I had three complaints that she's going through purses again. I can't have that. Why don't you just fire her? What are you, kidding? We're two girls short nowafter Sam's last fiasco. And he orders them up likefucking cheeseburgers. Besides, Tito, she's got the biggest-- Hey, Paul. Jesus, Candy, what's the gun for? It's in case I don't getthe point across with mine. I can't believe you set me up. Sam set you up, sweetie. I just got caught in the middle. You poor thing. You had to sell me out, you miserable fuck. Yeah, I did. - Why don't you two sit down?- Where? Sit down, Paul. [grunt] What was that for? Sheer spite. Stay on the floor. No problem. Tito and I are working past an awkward macho antipathy into a deeper,more personal understanding. You think I can developthat kind of understanding with Paul here? It'll be tough. You're a girl. I could shoot him in the balls. That's pretty macho. No, that's a feminine instinct. No guy would do that to another guy. What about his kneecap? I could shoot him in the kneecap. That is masculine. Are you kidding me? Right here? We're America's Most Wanted, Paul. To four five homicides, what's aminor mutilation among friends? Practically a misdemeanor. What do you guys want? You want fucking money? I'll open the safe. I hadn't thought about that. But as long as you're offering. We just want you to makea couple of phone calls. No problem. I'm sorry, John, I just gotthis urge to hit him where it would hurt him the most. I said I'd make the calls. Guess I'm too feminine to bond. It's a good thing you told me to back off, Devon, because your guysare lighting the world on fire. It wouldn't have played outany differently for you, Sam. I could take a shot at it. You had a shot at it. Your boys couldn't even kill a god damn whore. Just sit tight. I don't want this turning into a circus. You haven't been watchingthe news, have you? This is a fucking circus. And your cops are gettingtheir asses kicked. Is this why you called me,to critique my performance? Call you? I didn't-- what the fuck is this? It's where the first bullet goes if anybody moves, right, Lieutenant? Why don't you boys step outnow where I can see you. That assumes that the stripperis a threat just because she's got a gun in her hand. I pull the trigger, whereverthe red dot is, the bullet goes. Kind of takes all the skill outof shooting, doesn't it, Sam? Hey, let's slow down here. Well, obviously, there's something wrong with your strategy. I don't care if you shoot Sam. What's to stop me from making a move? Wondering what comes next. I had you pegged right from the start. You got pure talent. I wish you were just a little more disciplined. But-- The fact that I'm not apsychotic killer is a handicap. I'm going to tell you to two totake your guns out very slowly and put them on the floor. You get one chance. It's your job, Sam, to givehim a little encouragement. Come on, let's go. Go with the program. You first. Having the titty bar guy call us was brilliant, too obviousto even look suspicious. Kick it. Now you. I forgot my gun. Repeat that line, we'regoing to have the shortest argument on record. Get rid of the fucking gun, Ted. Got to do something tokeep him from warning us. What did you do with him? I locked him in his trunk. Ted. I know, Lou, you would have killed him. Locks can be opened. How about you, Sam, you carrying? I swear to God I'm not carrying a gun. I'll take my fucking clothes off if you want. I think we can all live without that, Sam. I guess that brings us to you, Lou. I don't think so, John. What makes you think I got anything to lose? You don't. But neither do I. I'mnot going to make a move. But I'm not giving up my gun. The ball's in your court. It never left my court. You know, considering the factyou're not a psychotic killer, a lot of people have beenshot in the past few days. It does get easier, everytime you pull the trigger. No way, John, you're not going to shoot me. You know why I know that?Because-- [gunshots] I don't know how that guypassed the lieutenant's exam. He hasn't been right about anything. You got a price on my girl's head? Your girl? Was there any particularreason other than the one I just eliminated? No. So you don't have any incentive to send anyone after us? Other than the fact that youjust shot two of my best guys, and then there's the Farrel brothers? That only amounts toproperty damage, doesn't it? Yeah, pretty much so. We borrowed a little travelingmoney out of Paul's safe. You got a problem with that? Until you point that gun somewhere else, I don't got a problem with anything. Consider it a dowry. Why don't I consider ita down payment for getting rid of this pain in my ass? That way, there's no theft issue. I don't kill for money, Sam. That would make me a criminal. You're no longer a cop. What else is there? That's a good point. Sam? That guy's got a package and a half, huh? You got to respect that. Come on. Let's go. Get up. Feel better? Absolutely. So this concept of a dowry intrigues me. Doesn't it usually involve a marriage? Well, that was just a metaphor. A metaphor, huh? It's a bad idea to mess with me, John. I know. I've seen you shoot. Don't you even want to know where we're going? I trust you. [music playing]
