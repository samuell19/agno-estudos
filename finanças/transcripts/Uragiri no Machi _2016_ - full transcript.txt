We were paid 300â‚¬ for this translation, it's not a fansub. But it's professional quality... Enjoy! "We are now in Guam." "-We're in Guam, yeah." -July- "18-19 years old, Massage play, telephone..." "I love to kiss"... "In a hotel in Ikebukuro" "Let's meet right now, I'm in Kichijouji." Miss TOMO (in her thirties) "30 years old, works in clothing, Lives in Musashino, 165cm tall, blood type B, slim." "I can meet you now, I'm in Higashi-Nakano." "I work in the mass media." "We cannot answer the phone right now, please leave a message..." "Hello Yuuichi..." "It's mom, your boss just called me." "Could you call me back, please?" From Miss TOMO "Your place is really close to mine." "How about we meet half-way, in Ogikubo?" "Sure... And don't worry, I'm not too bad looking." "Our passengers are kindly requested to refrain from using their cell-phones..." The City of Betrayal Please, excuse me? "Alright, I'll be wearing a red dress. See you then." We're supposed to meet, I think. Ah, yes. I'm sorry for being late. -It's fine. Eh? Eh? Well, then. We could start by having a tea? Sure. I'm sorry, I walk too fast? No, that is... Don't you think we should end it now. Eh? Sorry, you're realizing I'm a middle-aged lady... you didn't think I'd come. No need to be polite. I'll just tiptoe my way out of here. Hey, hey. You should know... I came early at the appointment. But... I checked from afar what kind of person would come. I would have left if you were ugly. But, how about you? Eh? How do you find me? Ah, no... You're fine. -Ah. I turned 40 this year. I'm idle, I'm not even working. Myself, I lied about working in the media... I'm just a part-time worker. Ah. Do you often use that kind of website? No, it's the first time. How about you? No, same for me. It's the first time I meet someone. That's why... at first I was so cold... because I didn't want to come at you too eagerly. Well... I'm aware I was frowning... for some reason... I couldn't control my face. These situations make people uneasy. Yes. In the train I was rehearsing what I was going to say. But as soon as I saw you, I went blank. Me too, I was trying to figure out how I would introduce myself... and I realized i was talking aloud. Don't you think this is kind of fun? Yes. Among my T-shirts this one's my favorite but... it was in the washing-machine for a wash... but I pulled it out wet to come here. For me, I never wore this dress... it was at the bottom of a drawer. I pulled it out in a haste. So it's the first time you wear it? Right, it's the first time. Are you OK? What do you usually do at this hour? I spend my whole day in front of TV. So, at noon between "This is Noon Biking" and "Tetsuko's House"... which do you prefer watching? I prefer "This is Noon". Me too. Then I watch "Gokingenyo"... Then it's "Miyaneya"... Then you switch to the drama replays... They mostly replay "Aibou" don't they. Then it's time for the evening news... and I think "Ah, another day has passed", time flies. It sure does. So... what do you watch at night? I watch essentially variety shows... I love variety too. -Really? Do you have a favorite comedian? I like 'Sandwichman' Wow, you have unusual tastes. What? You don't think they're funny? They're not women charmers, I figure. It's awesome that you like that kind of comedy. I'll take it as a compliment. I'm sorry. What should we do now? Ah. I'll let you lead. We could just think about it around a tea? That is... -Eh? I'll be going back now. Ah? It was fun, I had a great time. No. Ah. Please call me if you have time. If it's not too expensive for you. Alright, I'm going. Uh? What? Thank you for your time. Ah? Hello. Listen Shinji. Aren't you supposed to work? I don't know what you're talking about. Did you get one again? I hooked her on a site, and then we met... but she abruptly left. Really? -Yes. She gave you her number? She did, but the point was to get her now. I guess. -Right. See you. -Bye. Sorry, did I wake you up? Ah, it's fine. You worked late. We were so busy, I couldn't leave. Have you eaten? -Not yet. I bought that for you on my way back, it looks delicious. Ah. Did you go out today? -Eh? You look tired. Ah, well. Shinji invited me for lunch. Ah, nice. Sorry, I ate out. Ah, sure. I was out with Tamura. You went out today? Eh? Hey, this dress... Just for shopping. I never wear it, I thought. Ah, really? When you're done leave it to me... it's my turn to wash the dishes. Ah. -Uh? Nothing. Say, Yuu-chan... do you browse the net when I work? Eh? My whole history has been erased. It's not the first time I notice. Sorry. You don't have to hide that you're using it. Even though I bought it... you can consider it yours too. How's your work? We're going to have a tough month. Anything special? My contract should be renewed this month. I have two months rent overdue. Ah right. Your mom called me on my cell phone. Eh? Your boss was trying to reach you. Did you call back? Not yet. I told your mom you couldn't pick up because you're sick. Just stick to that and we're good. Sorry. You see, it happens to anyone to be discouraged about life. You see, myself I don't think your situation is hopeless. And I want you to know that I'm here for you. You don't have to feel diminished as a man. Yeah, sure you could feel that way. Look, I'm not lecturing you. I know. -Hm. Anyway your health comes first, eat well... It's work. Sorry, Yuu-chan, could you lower the volume? Hello. Yes, I'm sending it right now... Sorry. I'm very sorry. Yes. Yes, goodbye. I'm really sorry about that. Tomoko, don't you have something to tell me? Eh? Well. Today I was drinking with Tamura... Yes? His girlfriend and him are separated. Ah? That girlfriend was always uneasy about him. But she never told him what he could do to make it right. How can I say that... If you wanted me to change something, just say it. You could resent me for not taking a hint, I thought. Are you OK? Of course, I'm OK. There. -What? Today I used only 10$. Keep it. -No, take it back. What is it? Well, you know... I feel I'm just a burden for you, Satomi. I see how hard you work. I'm not specially... -No, no... What am I doing. I'm really at the end. No, you're not. Don't give me money anymore. Well, you have to... -Sorry, what I do is wrong. OK? Hm. It's decided... I'll get back on my feet. Ah. I'll get up early, get back to work, apologize to my boss. If I'm fired, I'll find another job. Hm. I've been slacking too much. Satomi, just look at me... tomorrow, I'm turning my life around. Ah, right. I have a few days off, so to relax... we could go to a hot spring resort. Ah. Even in Izu or Hakone, any place you like. Ah, maybe you would like something more simple nearby? Are you OK? Of course, I'm OK. If it wasn't for the mortgage, we could do better. You don't have to. Ah, I'm not asking you to work. You were considering it? Are you OK? Of course, I'm OK. Well, in that case... Koji. -Hm? I assure you... I'm OK. I don't have any complaints about the way you are. So you see... Right. Are you OK? Of course, I'm OK. -1 week later- "We cannot answer the phone right now, please leave a message..." "Hello, Yuuichi?" "How do you feel today?" "Are you going to work?" "When you feel better..." "call me back..." "Please." You have big breasts. Hello. Hello. Ah... It's you. Ah. Sorry, I called you by mistake. Ah? Eh? Eh? No, sorry... The M1 show is making a come back, right? Ah? They're making a come back. Right. -Ah. I thought deeply about that... I wondered if the M1 champions of the past... were to compete against each other, who would win? Right. That would depend how they feel that day and the order, I think. Right. Of course I want to root for Sandwichman... but their competitors are formidable. I don't think Non Style and Punk Bubu will make it. Ah, excuse me. Yes? Would it be possible, maybe... How can I say... I feel we could continue this conversation... face to face, I don't know about you. Ah? Plus, phone time is expensive. What do you say? You're right. -Right. Well... I'd like to see you again. Ah, sure, fine with me. Alright then... I guess we could meet at the same place as last time. In Ogikubo... Sorry, I'm late. It's fine. Give me a second. I'm glad to see you again. Where did we leave off the conversation at on the phone? At which M1 champion is the funniest. Ah right, what's the funniest stand-up in M1 in your opinion? That's a good question. I'd probably say the legendary Waraimeshi's museum stand-up... or Torijin who got full marks... and the Chirinchirin stand-up by Tutorial was hilarious. Well. Eh? I don't... have much time. Ah? For today... I should... You did that last time. If you don't have time... why do we meet at all? Don't take it the wrong way. I freed myself to meet you. I don't really mind but... Well. Well... In fact I'm married. Eh? My husband's meal has to be ready in time... so I fixed it before I came... that's why I was late for our meeting. I didn't want to lie. I'm sorry. Listen. I have a girlfriend myself. We're living together. Well, I'm telling you... Yes. Well in that case... you'd better leave. Hello. Sorry, you're working. It's fine. Mrs. Tanabe invited me. You don't know her but... I'll have dinner with her. I see, well, I'll prepare myself something. Shinji is inviting me for a drink. Dine without me. Alright. :) Say... about your husband... what kind of man is he? He's really a good man. Do you have kids? -Not yet. Yes. Eh? So, it's not going very well between you and your husband? Eh? Well, because... since you were on that website... Oh, no... it's not that my marriage isn't good... it's just that... somehow... Well. What kind of person is your girlfriend? Well... she's a very admirable person. She's always very considerate of me. So what were you doing on that website, then? Well. Just like you, somehow... Maybe we should go back? It's OK now, I made time. But for me it's tricky. Ah, right. I'll pay the bill. -You don't have to. It's fine. Please. -Yes. It's $18.20. Well... you shouldn't be too flustered when going back home. You'd rise suspicion. What about you, will you be OK? I have my old tricks. Alright. Can I ask your email address? Sure. Then I'll send you my address by SMS. Email is better than phone at night. I agree. Better erase your history. I know that trick well. I just sent you. Ah, it's arrived. That's it, reply to this one. OK. Eh? Eh? Eh? What was that? Eh? What should I say? -About what? Do you mind? -Eh? Please forgive me, sorry, sorry. Sorry about the impulse. It's OK. It's OK, we're two consenting adults, it happens... more or less. That's right. Right...it's time to go. It is. Sorry. Ready. Good evening. -Good evening. I'm exhausted. -What happened? Shinji was quite heavy. What? Something happened? I really didn't want to drink today. Since I lost my job, he said he'd found something. But he lied, I don't have time for that. I promised you, so I'm trying hard. Where did you drink? -Nakano. The $20 were enough? I'm sorry, he had to help me pay. Once I get a job, on my first salary... I'll pay you everything back. You don't need to worry about that. -But I do. As I said, it's done now. We'll talk again, sorry. Alright, right. That was Tamura. Say... It's for you. -What is it? What? What is it? You've wore that sweater so much... Time for a new one. Eh? Thank you. Eh? It was on sale next to the place where we had lunch. Eh? You make me so happy. I don't feel too well. Eh? Are you OK? I had to work late. Don't exhaust yourself, did you take an aspirin? No I'm allergic. You should go to the hospital tomorrow if you're sick. Alright, thank you. For our trip, Tamura says Hakone is great. Mrs. Tanabe said the same. There's even an outdoor hot spring in front of the bedrooms. Mrs. Tanabe said that too. We can't spend too much. We so rarely do that. Let's go there. "Thank you for watching today." How was it with your husband? Here everything went smoothly. -Sending- You're great, my tricks were efficient too. Please again, forgive my impulse. Good night. -Sending- On my side I apologize for being rude. Good night. -Do you want to erase your mails?- -Yes- "This year the 32nd Summer Festival was held in a park in Setagaya..." It's good to see you again. Last time it was at your dad's funeral. -That's right. How's your mom? She's in a great shape, actually. Are you going somewhere? I have a few days offâ€‹, we're going to the spa. It's great. -It's a small trip. What's the occasion? I had business in the neighborhood. I must go. You can stay for the night. Right? That's a nice sweater. I really feel good in it. Your sister bought it for me. It's a simple article, I got it on sale. When it's so nice, who cares about the price? I'll leave you two... Say... this tea is delicious. -Really? The taste is so special, and the perfume. Right. Where did you buy it? Sorry, I'll go now. I'm sorry. That's just cheap tea from the supermarket. Listen. I need to borrow cash. What else is new. How much can you lend me? Tell me the figure. 20,000$. We'd never see you otherwise. You take us for an ATM or what? We have our expenses too. What's the scorn on your face? Erase that. I don't know why you're dissatisfied. You left us to go live the big life in Tokyo. Until today, I'm still taking care of Mom. So wipe that scorn off your face. That time and money spent on spas, why don't you come... Please write down your account number. Forgive me for listening. I'll pay back every cent. That way we're even. Money is not the matter. You saw his face when he lent you that money? I hate to borrow from him. You haven't changed at all. You still won't give up. What's your goal? What do you want in life? I know the way. This too was bought on sale. Bye then. Sorry for the intrusion. It's fine. You're going? -I'm meeting a friend. Satomi has a few days off, you could take her some place. It's so crowded, give me a break. Couples nowadays go out this time of the year. That's not an ashtray. Uh? We always use it for snacks. This is OK. Eh? -No. I salute your praiseworthy effort... of cohabitation. OK, I'm going. Goodbye. -See you. Hey, hey. Dude, you notice how Satomi dresses, it's awful, right? It's Satomi. -Hm. Shit, did she hear us talk about her? Yuu-Chan, I was in a rush, I forgot... if you wanted to buy drinks and all, I left 20$ in the drawer. You can use them. Ah, nice, OK. OK, OK. So? What was it? Nothing special. So how is it going with Satomi? How what? You thought it wouldn't last. Hm. When you guys met at that party, you said she wasn't your type. Somehow, I got to like her... at least, I'm fine with her. Eh? You guys have sex? -Yeah. But her periods are welcome. I can have a break then. Just dump her then. She may even be lying to you, herself. I don't think she does. Today she's meeting a friend... maybe cheating on you. No. She won't. -How can you be so sure? No. She really doesn't strike me as the type who would do that. Eh? Eh? Although you are cheating. Eh? You said you met someone. You mean her. So? How is it going? I met her again. Really? So? You did it? Well, the mood was good... but I didn't want to push it. Ah? -Hm. Tell me. -Hm. Aren't you running away from life? Uh? Away from work, from Satomi... away from that nice lady. As a friend I urge you to face them. Do what has to be done. Alright? Well. Why Nishi-Ogikubo this time? Eh? Why did we meet here? It felt good to go to a different place. What can we do? I think there is a cafÃ© there. And what's there? There may be love-hotels that way... I'm not sure, really. Did you have lunch? -I did. I ate. Maybe this way is good... That way looks good too. Sorry, what kind of conversation was that? That was good. OK, let's have a serious conversation. How about the love-hotel? I really don't mind. -Really? Yes. -Oh. Since it's our third time, it was kind of expected. Me too, I thought, the third time should be as good as any. We were both openly planning the same thing. Communication was turning weird. I knew there are love-hotels in Shin-Ogikubo. There are none in Ogikubo. And I was concerned about that. Alright then, I want today to be perfect. I'll use all my skills. Yes, I'll work hard too. Wow, that sounds like great fun. Absolutely, I agree. Yeah. -Yeah. Shall we proceed then? Time to go. Why are you laughing. -I'm not. But you're laughing. -I'm not laughing. Yeah. -Yeah. That's super lame. It sure is. Enough. Sorry. I'm sorry. I came. Ah? Is it OK with your husband? It's all fine... if I buy him something on the way back. Ah? How about you? I pretend something's wrong... I come back sick. And then... she gets worried about my health. And she doesn't question me even if I'm suspicious. You're good at that. Ah. You see, I know... I'm aware that I'm a horrible person... but... and now, I kind of... feel guilty. It's not that I'm complaining about you... Ah, I see. Hm. How can I say? I'm... nicer than I thought. Ah? Sorry, I'm being serious. But I understand. I feel too... that weight on my chest... I'm wondering what I'm doing. I'm kind of sorry for what I'm doing to him. "That's not a towel, that's a flounder fillet." "Now my face is all sticky." "why did you give me a flounder fillet." "Would you like some ice-coffee?" Well, we should do like this... without thinking too much, when we want to meet... we should just meet. You're right... without thinking too much. "But that was miso soup..." "This is disgusting even with shoyu." "How is it? -Great." "I'll try." You got that one. You got that one too. "A broken..." "vibrator..." "a torn..." "love letter." "fragrant..." "fishnet stockings" "Darkened..." "vibrator egg." "As soon as you climb that hill..." "You can meet her." "You can meet her." "You can meet her." "You can meet her." "The late summer heat is still here..." but finally mornings and evenings have become cooler. -September- "In the north of Chiba Prefecture..." "People have cooperated..." "The surface this year is of 7000mÂ²" "We cannot answer the phone right now, please leave a message..." "Hello, Yuichi." "I still can't reach you on your phone." "Have you found a job?" "I haven't said anything to your dad." "Would you call me when you get this message..." "Please." "In Hokuchoubu, there was a suicide bombing..." "For three days the stock market has increased." "The Nikkei stock prices..." Hello. Ah. Could we meet today? Ah, sure. Did you get your husband's salary? Ah, yes. So you'll treat us to a good hotel. Well... What is it? There's something I'd like to discuss. Eh? What is it? I found out... I think I'm pregnant. My period isn't coming. So this morning, I went to the hospital. Could we meet now? Yes. So, let's meet in our usual place. Looking forward to it. Looking forward. "Next stop Ogikubo, the doors open on the right side." I'm so sorry. What are you sorry for? See... if I had been... more careful. I'm telling you... there's nothing to be sorry about. You don't bear the responsibility alone. Me too... I was enjoying it. And besides... maybe you're not the father. And even if you were... if you want it... I'll bear it. In any case... if I had to abort... you wouldn't object, right? -He nods- are you OK? I thought... I had done something stupid. But it wasn't a big deal. I'm glad it's settled. Sorry, I'm being selfish. It's OK. I feel like eating something delicious. Ah, sure. Maternity follow-up Book. Ah, you're back. Yeah. I prepared myself a bath. You did? And I prepared my dinner too. Today I attempted to cook meat potatoes. What's this? It's teriyaki. Eh? What's the occasion? Simply it looked good. That's not my question. You thought that would make me happy. Every time you come back late, you buy something... it always seems suspicious to me. You think I'm an idiot? You want me... to say, I'm cheating on you? How about you? How often do you come home late? You're drinking with your colleagues... are you spending all that time with them? With Tamura... Does this Tamura guy even exist? Never... have I heard anyone mention him. You're blind to your own shortcomings... How dare you judge me. Forgive me. Please forgive me. Lately... I don't... see you at all. That's why I've been worried. Please forgive... my reproaches. I'll... take a bath. Today, it's fine. Hey. -Hey. I had a drink with friends. How about you? Shinji invited me. Ah, alright. My friends just complain about the company... I'm exhausted. Yuu-chan. -What? Hey, what? I can't see the TV. -Who cares. You're hurting me. -I'm not hurting you. Enough, stop. Meeting with Shinji is exhausting. You should understand. Now you're upset. I'm not upset. I can see you're upset. Just watch your TV. If you have something to say, go ahead. I don't need a quarrel. Hey. I guess... you don't really love me. What's that? -There's someone else you love. I don't. You're cheating on me. You look guilty. -I don't look guilty. I can see it on your face. -I'm not guilty. You can admit, I won't get mad. I'm not cheating on you. You can't blurt out accusations like this. If you are that worried... why don't you behave more like a woman? Say. -Uh? You could make up and all. Look how you dress, I'm ashamed. I should have told you earlier. It's not your place to say that. Uh? It's your fault that I don't buy clothes. If you could just earn a little, I'd have something to spend. Look at you. You're loafing around all day. You're not even looking for a job. You're a worthless being. I should have told you earlier, too. Good morning. -Please, come in. Sorry for the intrusion. It took some time for the preparations. Pleased to meet you. I'm Tamura. Wait a moment. -OK. Your husband is so good to me. We are grateful for your kindness. I'm sorry to drink with him late at night. It's OK. Sorry, your husband was right. Eh? He always shows us photos of you. He's so proud of you. Even when we drink, he talks a lot about you. He always says that he doesn't deserve you. He's so infatuated. I'll carry the clubs. Ah, thank you. Please, don't tell him that. Goodbye. OK, see you tonight. Can we talk? What? -No. About what I said, yesterday. I know it's heavy... can I talk? Just say it. You see... all that time... why I didn't tell you what I had on my mind... I thought a lot about it. Are you listening? I am. So? Maybe... it made me feel safe to have you loaf around. That way you won't have money... and won't have any opportunities with women. I was so glad that you needed me. But I need to be sincere. You'd better get back on your feet. Look, you're just a burden... Yuu-chan. Don't you think we should talk tonight? Since I'm being harsh with you. I can't tell you what to decide... but... we can't stay like that. I'll go meet some friends. Say... is that a weird outfit? You're fine. OK, see you later. I want... to pay for the abortion. Eh? Men should pay, I think. I want to be reliable. Right. Ah. And... after that... I get it. You want to break up, right? Yes. I wanted to say that too today. Eh? I don't think we can go on like this. We can still do as if nothing happened. Yes. And... forget my mail of last night. Sorry. -Eh? You sent me a mail last night? Excuse me, I'll take that call. Ah, Shinji, sorry today I had to... Did Satomi tell you? -What? She called me and I just met her. Eh? I told her you met someone on the net. Ah? She tricked me. She had no clue you were cheating on her. If she dumps you... I'll introduce you to girls. OK. I'll call you later, see you. "I'm breaking up with her..." "If you were ready to leave your husband..." Well. It seems like my girlfriend found out. I just heard it on the phone. Because my friend told her everything. Well... it seems my husband knows about us. Eh? The mail you sent last night was marked as read. It's probable my husband read it. Ah? Ah? That's bad. That's bad. I'm so screwed. What am I gonna do? Come on... don't talk like that. Sorry. Just... Do you mind? Just... Just... Ah, I can't take it anymore. Good morning. Sorry... for being late. Say... Tamura is a good guy. We should go to the restaurant together. Yes. Sorry, I gotta go. Koji. Maybe... you want to tell me something. Right. Tell me Tomoko... Yes. Are you pregnant? Eh? I was sorting the papers, I found it. Ah. Why didn't you tell me? Is that because you wanted it to be a surprise? Ah, right. I see. You'll bear it for me, right? Of course. Thank you. You make me happy. Hey, can we talk? Well. I don't have much time. Ah. You met Shinji yesterday, right? He called me. He told me everything. You want to tell me something? I'm listening. Please forgive me. I wish you could forgive me. With Shinji... I let it go on for too long. It's not even because I wasn't satisfied with you. It just happened. Now he's saying he'd like to date steadily. First, I have no intention to lose you... but there's that... since you're cheating on me. Eh? Shinji told me. Ah. What can we do now? Eh? What if... we promised not to do it again? Hm. -Hm. Since I did it too. -Me too... if I promised you not to do it again, we're good. Since I did it too. Ah, but... you know, I'll try to find a job. No, it doesn't really matter. Hm. -Unknown number- I called you this morning. How long have you been seeing her? We have dated for less than a month. Last time I slept with her, I felt uneasy. There was like the imprint of someone else on her. I guess you left that imprint. But the kid is not yours. It's 2 months old. Please, leave us alone now. Neither you nor I want complications. Hm. And finally... I can alleviate your distress a little. I have a mistress too... she's not the only one. But I don't want to lose her. I deeply care for her, and that's the truth. But when I cheat on her, I don't feel anything for her. I even think I shouldn't have married her. That's also the truth. The truth is not unique. There are many truths. So you don't have to feel guilty for what you did to me. But now your exposed, let it go. That's all I wanted to say. Alright, I'm going. I'm meeting a girlfriend now. For now I have half the sum. I wanted to give it to Koji directly, but I must go home. I informed him earlier. He told us that you're pregnant. Eh? Koji was so happy. Ah. You should realize how happy you are. It's not because he lent us money... but Koji is a very good man. No doubt about that. Eh? It's not what you think. -We didn't do it. Satomi told me everything, I wanted to apologize. You can tell me frankly. Say it, say it all. No. You see... -Hm. Come on dude, lighten up. You played a dirty trick. I'm sorry. -It's a yellow card. You got a yellow card. -Sorry. A yellow card? It's a warning when a football player makes a mistake. It's for a mild misconduct. Ah, I see. Where are you going? -Bathroom. OK. Say... let there be no hard feelings... so we should take it like... in a pop style. I really don't mind. -That's good. Hello. -Hello. I'm still in the bathroom. How did it go? It was cool, as you saw. I really don't wanna lose him. I heard that. Well, for us it's a challenge we must face. So let's face it the three of us together... and overcome it. Good evening. Good evening. So kind of you to invite me. Tamura wanted to visit us... You have beers? Mrs. Tomoko, congratulations. Eh? For your pregnancy. Your husband just told me. Such a happy event, I wonder who it'll take after. I'll buy some snacks. -You don't have to. Maybe he won't take after me. Eh? The kid. That would rather be a relief for the kid. I'll use the bathroom. Thank you Tamura. Eh? You told her I'm always drinking with you. It's nothing. Ah, I need to go to the store. -Hm. -Incoming call : The Lady- Hello. Hello. It's been 4 months. -February- I'm sorry. I didn't pick up your calls. Ah, it's OK. Could we meet now? -Ah. The place where we used to meet? Looking forward to it. Looking forward to it. I was told to shut up but... your husband asked to meet me. Ah. Then... it could be his child. I thought I'd let go. But I couldn't. Me too... when he knew I was pregnant... at that moment... It could be your child. I couldn't tell him. I must tell him today, I thought. Time went by. What am I doing? I could ask myself the same question. If we could think of some plan. Like we did before. I think it's impossible now. I never... thought of it before... why was I with you. While I didn't see you I thought about it. A teacher once told me that nobody minds slackers... and that it was an easy path nowadays. And that's how I ended up where I am. I get it somehow. Should we go now? But maybe we don't want to. Right. I don't want to either. It's like... we don't know what to talk about. That's right. So we really should go. Ah, OK. You'll go, really? How about you? Maybe I could stay a little longer. Alright... I could stay a little longer, too. At this rate we'll never go home. We are still escaping. But for me, if I try hard, I can do it. Me too, if I try hard, I can do it. So... we should make this moment last. I have no clue what you're talking about. "Yuu-chan, I have to work early today." "Don't forget to eat breakfast. Satomi" "The sky will be clear all day with sudden changes in the evening." -2 years later- "...with high temperatures ranging from 24 degrees..." "Because of works on the tracks, the train may suddenly stop..." our standing passengers are advised to grab the nearest support." Hey, let's go. -OK. -P&D Print Service- Ah. Hi. It's been a while. It's been a while. Are you working? Yes. How about you? My child has asthma. I was told this is a good hospital. Right. Sugawara. -Yes. What are you doing? -Coming now. I'm sorry. Well... So your name is Sugawara? Yes. Eh? And you? It's Hashimoto. So, you're Mrs. Hashimoto. Yes. Alright. -Ah, I'm sorry. Please... Mrs. Hashimoto. Take care. You too Mr. Sugawara. Take care.
