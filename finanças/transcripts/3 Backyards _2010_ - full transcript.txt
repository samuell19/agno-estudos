Do I have the number where you're going? I think my office has it. We were going to talk before you left. Well... You fell asleep. So what, then? Nothing. I don't know. Maybe. Maybe when I get back. Tina! Tina! Middle school just went by! Tina, don't make me crazy on my birthday. Might even free up some time for tomorrow. Tina! Tina! I'm coming! Sweetie. Tina, the bus is here! I'm coming! Tina, your mom. Later, dad. Christina, you miss that bus, and I am not taking you. Do you hear me? Crap. The bus came already. Hey. Anything? Anything? Oh, no, nothing yet. Well, you will. You're doing linens? Uh, no, drop cloth; I'm painting. - Have fun. - Okay. Stock prices have been rising since the Dow Jones opened this morning. Tina Lamberg reports. Gas prices are up 16Â¢. Regular grade is averaging 2.68 per gallon across the country, with expected gains even higher through the long weekend. Now traffic and transit on the threes. We have delays up to one half hour, and an accident early this morning leaves Jericho Turnpike bumper to bumper through exit 13. Alternate routes recommended. Now let's hear from Marlene Jaeger in the weather center. ...hot and humid with a high of 85. I'm meteorologist Marlene Jaeger, in the WLII radio weather center. Shitsky. I'm coming! Ack! I'm coming! Route 25A to Greenport and county Road 39 to Montauk Highway are all in good shape, but congestion... Hi. Oh, my God, hi. I'm sorry; I didn't even recognize you. You caught me off guard. So what's up? Right, yeah. Right, right, right. Absolutely! You bet. Of course. Are you sure it's not any trouble? No, no, no, no. So I can just be over your place with my car... Well, what time is good for you? I was thinking about 1:00. Great. Are you sure it's okay? Please, stop already. Please. I am very happy to. It would be an honor, actually. Okay, all right, so... - Thanks so much. - No, thank you. Thank you. All right, so we'll see you later. Bye. What is the number? - Hello? - Look out the window! - Peg? - Look out the window. - She's right there. - Who is? Her. Oh! Ah! Oh, my God, please don't wave. Why not? I...I don't know. Oh, she's a tiny little nothing. I can't see her anymore. I can't see her anymore; I'm going upstairs. Don't lose her! Jill, she was here. What? She was standing in the living room. - She was... - Where'd you go? Are you there? By the gate. She's over by the gate! Michaela's gate! Oh, I can't see her. Are you there? Where are you? Hello? Did you see that? With the glasses? Yes. - Movie star! - I know! Look, I'm up in my bedroom. I couldn't remember your phone number. I was staring at my phone. I didn't know what the hell was going on. So then I remember, "Oh, speed dial." Well, tell me. Well, she asked me to take her to the ferry. Over in Port Jeff? What did you say? I said, "No, I'm not going to take you to the ferry." What do you think I said? I'm coming over with coffee right now. No. No, no, don't come over. - Why not? - Becau...I don't know. I don't want them to think I called everybody I know. Then why did you, tardo? All right, I will call you later. I will tell you everything, okay? Ugh! Fine. All right, bye. Hey! I saw your dog over there. Where was it? Over there. Wait. Gotta go. Grounded. I'm sorry, sir. Security measures. All three of today's flights have been canceled, sir. You've got to be joking. I am sorry for this inconvenience. The best I can do is offer you a hard ticket for the same flight leaving tomorrow. What? No. What about another airline? You're more than welcome to do that, sir. No, you do it. But just so you know, this ticket is nonrefundable, as it was purchased for your company by using frequent flier miles. Would you like me to go ahead and book you on tomorrow's flight? Fine. I can offer you a complimentary room at an affiliated hotel near the airport. I...I don't need a hotel. I...I live here. I just need a flight out. Well, here you go. I am sorry for the inconvenience, sir. You're more than welcome to stay at a hotel courtesy of the airline. I live here. Paging passenger Devlin Terry. Devlin Terry, please... Uh, I was in the backyard. I was painting, and the doorbell rang, and, boom, she was standing there. She seemed very regular. Really? Was she beautiful? Well, no. I mean, you know, she's not a kid. - She's like us. - Huh. I thought maybe she was calling to say "thank you" for the note. - What note? - The note. I told you; I wrote her a note. No, you didn't. Yes, I did, when she moved in. I wrote her a note saying that I was a friend of the woman whose house she was renting and... - Since when? - Jill. And just that if she needed to know how anything worked... Oh, please. And then what? I was just being friendly. Oh, yeah? And then if she could introduce you to some of her celebrity friends, that would be okay, too? - Jill. - What? I was just being nice. And she is not a movie star, for God's sakes. She's just an actress. I'm up in my bedroom. What about this? Oh, who cares? You're doing her a favor. Wear that thing from Bergdorf's. I don't want her to think I got dressed up. So why are you? When are you taking her? Later this afternoon. Oh, my God, Jill, you've got to pick up the kids from practice if I'm with her. All right, well, that's all right. I have Pilates anyway. So why does she need you, anyway? I don't know. What does that mean? Maybe she doesn't drive. She couldn't call a taxi? Well, I...I don't mind. You know, she hasn't so much as said "hello" since she's been here. I am sure a person like that probably needs her privacy. Then why not call a taxi? She may not want to be alone all the time either. She's probably a bitch. Why? I don't know, just 'cause they probably all have to be like that to get where they are. All right, would you stop already? I'm serious. Hey, you know what was weird, though? What? I mean, not weird but... What? Tell me. I don't know. It looked like she had been crying. Crying? Why? How do I know? Okay, if anybody finishes early, you may excuse yourself quietly and go to the cafeteria and eat your lunch, okay? Go home! Shoo! What did I just say? Quietly. I just said it. Now, if you're done, put your work away, and go eat with the other classes... Quietly. Tucker! Tucker. Such a good boy. Did you have an adventure? Hello? Hey, Emmie. How you doing, snoopy? Hey, dad. - You awake? - Mm-hmm. Mom! Dad's on the phone! Mom! I'm downstairs. She says she's downstairs. Where are you, daddy? Well, you know where I am, kiddo. No, I don't. Sure, you do. You're calling from the plane? You've got it. Mom! Dad's calling from the plane! Sweetie, I can't hear you. He's on the plane right now. I don't know. That's just what he said. Mom! Whoa, no, no, no, don't go, kiddo. Hold on. Hold on. Don't go. How you feeling? A little better. Yeah? Just a little better? But no school, though, huh? Come on. Where are you really? Well, I told you already. I am on a plane. Then tell me what you see. What do I see? Uh, well, I see clouds and sky. No, wait. I see rain in the clouds. What's it like there, kiddo? Just morning. That's it? Just morning? It's not temperate or balmy or inclement? I don't know. It's just regular. Ma, dad's on the phone! Oh, no, no, snoopy, don't go. Don't go. Tell me... Tell me what you're doing. Nothing. Are you upstairs? No. Yeah? Well, then where? Your office. Oh, are you drawing? Oh, my God. Yeah. You're not using my good pens, there, are you, kiddo? Uh, no. You're a good girl, snoopy. You know that? I know. You know I love you? I know. Hello. Hey, it's me. I was downstairs with the washer. What's wrong? Nothing. So what's...what's wrong with the... What's wrong with the washer? Why are you calling from the plane? I just am. It's the same thing. What, it doesn't soak or what? No, it soaks. It just doesn't spin the water out after, so it ends up flooding out the back. I don't know where it's coming from. Why don't you call the guy and have him come and look at it? What? You know, call the guy. You said we couldn't afford... It's fine. You know, we need it, so let's have him come in and look at it. This is going to be a fortune. It's fine. How is it going to be fine? It's...it's fine. Well, I didn't expect to hear from you. I just called to talk to Emmie. I mean... So what are you doing? Well, I was with the washer, and now I'm cleaning up after breakfast. You're not sitting around, eating bonbons? Well, if cleaning up after breakfast sounds like fun to you, then, yeah, I'm having a blast. You certainly sound happy. I don't know. Yeah. Okay, I don't know what we're doing here. Is something wrong? Never. This phone call is costing a fortune. Ah, come on. Come on? Come on what? You suddenly decide to be in a good mood? Were you there last night? I don't know who the hell I'm talking to. Forget it. No. Not forget it. All we do is forget it. Talk. I am talking. That's what I was doing. About what? I'm...I'm going... I'm going to hang up. It's... Then do. Hang up. Because if we're not going to talk, if you're not, then I don't know what... I don't know what's going to happen, John. I don't. Say something. Say something. I'll say it, too. Nah. Hello? Hey. Oh! I'm so sorry. Hi. I'll just be a sec. Okay. Whoo! Sorry, I didn't see you there. Guess I had too much coffee. Boy, this place is just looking beautiful. She always finds the most interesting things. I'm such a dodo when it comes to plants. I'm always so jealous of people who know how to make things so beautiful, you know? What? Oh, nothing. You want to put that in the back? Okay, you just... You pop the trunk. There's a little thingy. Uh, you put your hand under the bottom...okay. Oh, you got it. Okay. Here we go. Okay. Let me if you need more air, by the way. No, I'm fine, thanks. Okay, to the ferry. This shouldn't take very long. Okay. Stop sign. Do you want to drop that off? What? There's a mailbox. Oh, great. Let me get that for you. Why? I'm going to wait right here. Thank you for doing this. Oh, please. Are you kidding? Like I was going to get anything done today. I am really totally happy to. Um, I know it's none of my business... Hmm? No, just I know it's none of my business, but I saw that when you first... Shouldn't we... Oh, my goodness, yes. We should. Let's rock and roll. Nothing right now? No, nothing right now, no. Do you have a resume, something to leave? - No. - No? No, I'll just keep coming back. Hey, morning. What can I do for you? Something for breakfast around here. Breakfast? Oh, anything, actually. I'm a little screwed up with time. Ah, where you traveling from? Nowhere. There's our Paris Bistro. Over there? Okay, um, what's the good word on the Paris Bistro? Ooh, dubious. What about outside? There's not a lot. Uh, a diner if you head west. All right. I'm going to give it a try. I'll let you know what I come up with. So this is town. It's not much of one, really, but... Well, that's not true. I mean, it's okay. It's got its charm. You know, off season, it's actually a lot more... Oh, God, this is the movie theater. Oh, yeah. Have you been? Oh, God, it's wonderful. It's so beautiful. It's so old. God, you would probably really love it. Oh, listen to me. It's probably the last thing you want to be doing when you're not working, right? But they do get a lot of interesting things out here, you know, like indie films from the city; some offbeat, you know, little stuff. I bet you'd probably really like that. I mean, who's kidding who, you know? We go to that big Hollywood stuff all the time. I got two kids; you have to, you know? But I think you have to balance it out, I think, you know? But, actually, we're very much into that art house stuff. Actually, you know, I paint. - Really? - Yeah. You know, just for me. I...I used to show in some galleries down here, but I've stopped that. It's a whole, you know, other scene. But now it's just for me. I get a lot out of it; it's like therapy, I guess. I think artwork can be, you know, like a form of therapy, don't you think? I...I don't know. I'm not an expert. Yeah, that's interesting. You know, that's...that's actually very interesting. Anywhere you like. Coffee? Uh, please. I know what I want. Two eggs over hard, hold hash browns, and I'll have a salad instead. Whole wheat, white, or... Rye bread's good. Okey dokey. Mm. How is the... How is this Belgian waffle thing? Oh, it's disgusting. It's got ice cream on top and maraschino cherries, if we have 'em. That's great. Instead of the eggs. No, all together, the eggs too. Good for you. Here you go. Oh, and we have cherries. That's great. That's great. You need anything else? I'm fine, thank you. Yeah? See if it's hot. I got a new one brewing. I think it's okay. Thank you. Anywhere you'd like. Thank you. Coffee to start? Oh, yes, please. Thank you so much. You know what you want? I'm here to see Gus. About the job? Yes. What? Stand over there. No, no, sweetie, over there. Where were you? He was here already. I'm late? Here it is. Sweetie, don't show me, okay? Yeah, it's me. She's here. Right now! I don't know; ask her. Oh, I see. Ach! Now I see. He's in the other place. You're going to have to wait till he gets here. My mistake. My mistake. So you're in town a lot, then. Not really. But you know Natalie? No, I saw you wave back in town. I've known Natalie for a long time, a lot of years. She...she owns a gallery down on main street. Well, she used to, anyway. I don't...I don't know what she's doing now. We were a lot closer back then. That's what happens, you know? People come in and out of your life, and it's all for some reason, I'm sure. I'm like you; I got to protect myself. 'Cause if you don't, some of these people just swallow you alive. You know, there's a lot of personalities in this town. No names, but... You start getting caught up in that, and you're finished. It's just like a whole stupid, ugly scene unto itself. Are you okay? Oh, my God. Is there anything I can do? I'm so sorry. Sorry. Oh, no, no, no, no. Please. I'm so, so sorry. No, no, no, no, please. Please, please don't apologize. It's over. Sorry. No, please don't apologize. Please? That was just so real, what just happened. I feel... I think what you just did was so great, and I...I... It was so real. I know I keep saying that, but it really was. Can I tell you something? And I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I was just saying to my friend right before I came to pick you up, I was just saying that I bet somebody like you probably just wants to talk every once in a while to somebody regular, you know? You probably just want to be treated like everybody else, right? Thank you. I mean, can I be honest for a minute that I didn't know what to expect, you know, meeting... You know, like, you think to yourself how you would act, and then... But I knew it. I knew, deep down, I knew that you were just like everybody else. So what's going on? All right, can I tell you something? That if you knew me better, you would know that if there is one thing that I'm good at, it's being a shoulder to cry on. It's okay. I knew it as soon as you got in the car. This is crazy! I see you over there, and I don't know how to help you... Stop! Please, stop. The ferry. Okay. Top it off? Uh, no, thanks. Just the check, please. Thanks, hon. Thank you. Here he comes. What happened to you? - Hello. - I was waiting. Hello. I know. Ach, I had it written down here, but maybe I wrote it down wrong. What is this? Don't write. Bring two coffees. Where you live? Nearby, over the bakery. Have you done this before? Okay, you know that he's going to have to trail two weeks, minimum. - You know that. - Sounds fine to me. That's two weeks, no tips. - Tell her. - What? Yeah, two weeks, no tips. That'll be fine. In two weeks, you can learn the menu. That's fine for me. I can do that. Guess who isn't sharing weekday lunches. You'll do weekends and nights. Is that okay? Janusz. I'm not dealing with him. All right, one second. I need somebody who's going to start right away. Is that going to be a problem? No, not at all. Tonight. Tonight? Yes, I can do that. Believe me, I can do that. Where is the uniforms? Under the stairs. Janusz. How many tables you handle, huh? Ask her. - Ask her! - What? Sweetie, how many tables can you hold down? Oh... Well, that's hard to say, right? What's hard about it? How many tables? I'm sure once I get good, you're going to see me... Oh, boy. Where did you work before? At the bakery over near where I live. Bakery. And back home, catering. Ah, no, no, no. When is it the guy comes for the boiler? How am I supposed to know? I'm supposed to make that call? All right, all right, all right. When he come, call me. They're not coming. That's how they are. You gotta call 'em. Sweetie, it's on the house. Thank you. You have new messages. Message one. Hey, John. It's me. I...I don't know if you landed or where you are, but... Could you call me when you get this, okay? Just to talk. Uh... Uh, I don't know, John. I... I'm not so good at fighting like this, like... Like you are. Um... Even if it's just for me, could... Could you call, please? Would you? Message two. This is a courtesy call from Jet Air to inform you that your previously canceled flight has been rescheduled. If you are receiving this message, it is because you were a passenger booked on Jet Air... Flight 617. And have now been rescheduled onto Jet Air... Flight 804. Departing at... 6:30 P.M. Passenger check-in is at... 4:30 P.M. We're sorry for any inconvenience this change may cause you. We appreciate your patience, and we thank you. Forget your hat? What? No. Let me ask you, what happened to this woman that was right here... What? The woman that was at this booth. What woman? For the...for the job. For...you know, for waitress. How should I know? What was that? Did you hear a... Someone got hit. - What? - Someone got hit. Who? Who was it? Tina! - Hello. - Hi. Jill, hi. You back? What happened? No, no, I'm still in the car. Yup, listen, can you do me a huge favor, sweetie? Is she right there? Can you talk? Yeah, this is taking longer than I thought. Yeah, I'm...I'm wondering if you can pick up the kids from practice. - I'm... - What? I'm way the hell out here, and I just don't know if I'm going to be back in time, and I... I don't want them to wait out front if I'm not going to be there. I told you already that I would. I told you this morning. You can, sweetie? Thank you so much. Thank you. I owe you big-time, okay? Peggy, what is going on? What are you not telling me? Yup, okay, I'll talk to you later. - Bye-bye. - Don't you dare- I do appreciate you doing this. Mm-hmm. Well, we're almost there. I'm sorry about all of this. Why? Nothing happened, right? Nothing happened. You know, I guess I'm just crazy to think that you would feel better if you had somebody to talk to. What? Okay, you know what? Let's just put this to rest, shall we? This is getting really boring. You got the wrong lady here for this kind of thing. If this is what you wanted, you should have gotten Natalie to drive you, okay? What happened? Nothing, nothing. Someone got hit. It's over. Who got hit? Nobody, somebody. Some chick got hit. It's over. Leave it alone. You a reporter? Well, was it a black chick? Why? Do you know her? No, no, I don't know her. But did you see it happen? No, I didn't see it. The kid saw it. But leave it alone, huh? Call it a day, huh? Thanks. Could I ask you something? You saw the lady that got hit? Yeah. Was it a black lady? Yeah. Okay, it was. So how old a lady was it? He don't know that. What happened? She wasn't looking. She be all like this with her pocketbook. Was she wearing a blue dress? Yeah, she was wearing a blue dress. She ain't seen nothing. Yes, I did. And I saw her sister leaning over her when they put the sheet on top. Her sister? I don't know, someone. She was wearing a bright-colored dress. But was it a bright blue dress? I don't know. Think. Was it...was it bright blue? You knew her, right? No, I... I just want to make sure... Then tell a cop. They're looking for someone who knew her. Tell the cop. No, I don't know her. She just said that she lived around here... Excuse me! He knows her! He knows her. Go on and tell a cop. You know what? Forget it. I...is there a bakery around here? Because she said she lived around a bakery. You know what? There's one up on "J" street. Yeah, on the top over there on "J" street. I'll pop the trunk. I'm sorry. Hey! What are you doing back there? I know you're back there! Hey! Get in the house right now! I'm coming. Hello? Hey, sweetheart. It's me. Hello? Sweetheart, can you hear me? - John? - Yeah, it's me. It's me. I can't hear you. Don't hang up. Can you hear me? Don't hang up. Where are you? Hold on; I'm going to try to move a different place. John. John, where are you? I'm still at the airport. I'm still here. But I'm leaving. I'm leaving right now. Can you hear me? I'm calling to tell you that I'm... I can't hear you. I can't. I'm going to hang up. Sweetheart. Sweetheart. If you can hear me, John... Call back. I'm going to hang up. Bye. Bye-bye. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God, it's gorgeous. It's gorgeous. Christina, look. Look what daddy got me for my birthday. Isn't it beautiful? Just go in and ask her. No. You're such a baby. Mom, Ricky wants to know if we're having dinner tonight. I did not say that. Big baby. What the hell is all this? Honey, Jill's on the phone. She... Sweetie, why are you crying? I have no idea. I'm right here. I'm right here, right here.
