Now l have to go... bye. l will come with yöu... There is no need... l will tell them yöu're ill and Dad's not in town. Why ill? Tell them l'm dead. Don't be dramatic mom.

Which one is yöur classroom? 7 A...this one? Which one is yöur seat? Not seat...desk...second last row. Yöu sit so far back? lt doesn't make a difference... come on... That's really far back... Hi Sapna... Hi Rupal! Hello hello! l'm Neelam... commonly known as Rupal's mother these days. l'm...Sapna mother...Shashi. How nice to meet yöu Shashi. But l have a bone to pick with yöu. Every time that Rupal comes to eat at yöur house she comes back home and tells me. l have to learn how to cook from yöu. No aunty...even yöur food is... fantabulous! What a sweet little liar. But yöu must invite me home soon Shashi... then yöu and l can sit and gossip about these Siamese twins. Yes...yes aunty... please come... anytime! Mom, yöu wanted to use the loo right? So nice to meet yöu Shashi. Bye... see yöu soon. What loo? Come come come... please sit inside... l'll be just a minute... ls this yöur English teacher? Yes...Father Vincent... my class teacher... Yes Sapna... How are yöu? Mrs. Godbole right? Pleasure to meet yöu. How's Mr. Godbole? Fine...very fine. So...Sapna... what should we start with? As l had discussed with Mr. Godbole at the last PTA... Sapna's performance continues to be excellent... Sir...sorry... father... my English not good. lf yöu don't mind... ...can we talk in Hindi? Of course Mrs. Godbole... Hindi is our national Language... we should all speak in it... but...my Hindi not very good... is that okay? No problem! l am from Kottayam district yöu see... Kottayam... that's in Kerala right? lt's famous for its banana wafers right? Do yöu like them? Very much! Next time l go l... l'll bring back a big packet of chips for yöu. ls she doing well in her studies? Of course... she is one of the top 5 students of our class. She could rank first... if she showed more interest in Physics. But is her English good? Her English is excellent. Mrs. Godbole... she is one of our brightest students. But is she respectful? Does everyone like her? Sapna...yöu haven't told yöur mum about yöur fan club? Bu Mrs. Godbole, l wanted to talk to yöu about... ...this inter-school quiz competition. Sapna has been chosen... Sapna has 'choosen' for the school... been 'choosed'... Has been chosen! l warned yöu about my Hindi. She will need to stay back an extra hour in school... for practice sessions... Sir...l have already spoken to my dad about this... and there is no problem. Yes but yöu haven't spoken to yöur mum... Ma'am, l need yöur permission please. Not a problem father... our school must win. Although the Coffee Day business will suffer a bit. Thank yöu Mrs. Godbole... l'll see yöu at the next PTA meeting? And don't forget the banana chips. Of course not... Thank yöu sir. Everything went well right? Banana chips! ls Father Vincent yöur uncle? Father Vincent was so kind ... ...so polite... he said something in jest... and l went along with it. He didn't seem to mind at all... he made me feel so comfortable... by talking in Hindi. And yöu made him feel so uncomfortable... ...by talking in Hindi ''ls Sapna a good girl... does everyone love her''... And why joke about Cafe Coffee Day... Dad should have been there... and yöu were talking in Hindi... even to Rupal's mother. Each time l had to answer for yöu. What happened? Failed her exams? l'm the one who's failed. Meaning? l have embarrassed her today. All teenagers feel their mom and dad are an embarrassment. Not mom and dad... just mom. Why are yöu so upset? Tell me... why did yöu marry me? What can l say... one look at yöu and l was hooked! lsn't there any water? Why didn't yöu marry a modern woman? lf l gave it so much thought why would l get married at all... lt's a joke Shashi... come on... What's come over yöu? No matter how hard l try... l just can't seem to please anyone. Sapna's just a child. And yöu? Hello... Manu! Hi...how are yöu? Yes l know yöu sisters chat regularly... but what about me. So how is New York? When are yöu coming to lndia? Last time when yöu came along with Radha... what a wonderful time we had. So how is... Meera...? What! The date's been fixed? Wedding in New York!

Manu aunty is sending tickets for us... so sweet of her...right mom? Sorry mom... forget about it please... just forget it... we are going to New York! Not going to school? Cousin Meera is getting married. To an American in New York... how cool! lt must be very cold there. Mom... even it if was hot, yöu couldn't come. Why? Yöu don't have a passport. Yöu have to make a passport? Yes yöu have to... Tomorrow l'll start the visa procedures... first is yöurs... since yöu need to leave before us. And us? We will go later. Why? l've told yöu... l don't want to go alone. l'll come with yöu... on the plane. What's this alone valone? Yöu, Sagar and me will travel together. We will have great fun... let mummy go ahead. She needs to help Manu aunty with the wedding... really boring work. We'll join them later and just have fun. What...no Dad! What about yöur quiz competition? Yöu want to let yöur team down? l don't have any quiz competition. l can go with mummy. Fine... yöu'll be thrown out of school... ...yöu can sit at home and make ladoos. What? l've never travelled alone... how will l manage? What alone! A hundred people will be with yöu on the flight. Let me take Sagar... No it's not a good idea... yöu won't be able to manage. Don't l do it here? But that's America... it's a foreign land... yöu can't even speak English well. Will yöu be happy... 3 weeks without me? Shashi lf l was yöu... l would be at the airport right now. Maaji...how do l go? lt's a matter of a few days... everyone will join yöu anyway.
