[WOMAN READING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [SLOW JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [ALL EXCLAIM] [SLOW PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PAUSES] [ALL EXCLAIM] [MUSIC RESUMES] Come on, make it big. Make it big. No, no, no! [ALL EXCLAIM] HENRY: Tony. Oh, Mr. Cragin. Something's happened to my chair, Tony. Chair. Yes. I noticed it was cracked. I was trying to fix it. We were playing musical chairs. It's a hard game. Oh, that's easy for you to say. You won. Tony, you broke my favorite chair. Emily broke it, sir. [EXCLAIMS] That was my favorite chair. I was gonna be buried with that chair. Well, sir. I'll have it fixed by then. Tired? Mm-hm. Where does this go, Dad? I don't know. Is your friend, the ice box, still here? No, Tony drove him home. Tony was his designated driver. Which means he's in serious training. Um, I'm crashing. I'm sorry about the chair, Daddy. I was very nice about that, wasn't I? I just loved that chair. You hated that chair. Well, the important thing is that Emmy won. Yes, I thought so. It wasn't easy either, Tony has a mean hit check. What time do you want to leave in the morning, Sam? Uh, not early, sis. Good. Then you'll knock on my door when you get up, then? Sure. Okay, happy birthday. Thank you. Good night, Daddy. Good night, sweet pea. So, we seeing you in the morning? Yeah, I'll be here. Are you going back to the city? No. We're going home. How is your mother? She's fine. Is she still teaching? No. Oh, that's too bad. I bet she's a good teacher. I think her practice is taking more time. I thought she would have given up the law by now. She was talking about going back to school. Actually, she was talking about getting back into litigating. She hates litigating. Well, I hate running marathons but I do it. Grace hasn't been in a courtroom since the Exon case. Maybe she just doesn't want that curved on her tombstone. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Thank you for the party. You're welcome. Happy birthday. Good night. Good night, son. [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] Mr. Todd, good morning. How are you? How was your Fourth of July? Very exciting. We had a big parade in our wheelchairs. And the nurses cheered and waved. Wow. Sounds fun. Now, you're gonna wanna read this new contract before you sign it. Oh, you don't trust me. I don't. Never did. We'll need another witness. How about you, Mr. Harbison? Oh, not him. He'll be dead before I will. Oh, I don't know. He looks all right to me. If I'm dead before you, my doctor's gonna give me a refund. [BOTH CHUCKLING] [ELEVATOR DINGS] Tony. Mrs. Cragin. Hi. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Should I worry about meeting you here? No, no, no. I was just visiting a client. Listen, what's this I read about you? You read the sports section? Yeah. Sometimes it's all I read. So, is this real? Are you really? You're doing it. You're going to the Majors. Yeah. I have a problem with that, see. Because I hate the Yankees. Well, I suppose your dad's just over the moon about it, right? He's pretty pleased. Yeah, right. Come here. Congratulations, darling. Listen, just ask him how soon they can trade you to the Red Sox, okay? Okay, I'll get right on that. [WALTZ MUSIC PLAYING] Well, I thought the proms was extraordinary. I hope my snoring helped. It was a little slow for the allegro. What are we having? I'm having a scotch. I'll have a white wine. A scotch and white wine, please. [SCATTING] Well, Henry. What a surprise. I thought you were a registered free thinker. Well, they went out of business. I don't believe we've met. Sorry. How do you do? This is my democratic friend, Priscilla Mason. This is Dick and this is the good Mrs. Cragin. Priscilla. Nice to meet you. Hello. Well, Henry. Nice to see you. Priscilla. Excuse us. As opposed to the bad Mrs. Cragin? Presumably, I don't know. He seems quite on a human scale in person. Oops. [SIGHING] Grace, you've been divorced from him for six years. You want me to step on your hand? No, thank you. I'm just a little bit clumsy and you know it. You're the least clumsy woman I've ever met. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] Who was that? Has somebody burned down our office? [CHUCKLING] That was Marvin Shanker. He wanted to know if we'd represent him if he gets sued. Ugh. Who's Marvin Shanker? He's Althea's dentist. Would you mind draining these potatoes? Yes, sorry. Sorry. Well, tell him that we don't take any clients who call at 9:00 a.m. on a Sunday. Okay. I'll tell him that. Okay. Anyway, this 20-year-old kid comes in for a filling. All right. All right? And he's got this white spot on the inside of his cheek. Now, Marvin says, "I don't want to alarm you, "but you should have that looked at." "Looked at" or "removed". He forgets what he said. Right. He's not an oncologist, you know. So, this kid puts it off for months. He's a kid. So, when he finally has it checked, it turns out his mouth is full of cancer. You know, he may have to have his whole jaw taken off or something. Oh, God. So, Marvin's afraid of being sued. So, why is that the dentist's fault? Well, apparently this kid's been using snuff for years. That's what made Marvin nervous in the first place. Well, then, he should have insisted on a biopsy, right? Uh, yeah. He knows that. That's right. That's why he's scared. Well, the thing is, he's a local hero. He's a baseball star. He's on the Yankees farm team. You know, he's going up to the Majors. So, Marvin's afraid he'll sue for loss of future earnings. What's his name? Uh, Tony. Tyler. Tabor. Yeah, Tabor. That's right. Do you know him? Oh, no. No. Yeah, I adore him. He went to school with my kids. He's Sam's best friend. Oh, no. Yeah, I just saw him, like, two weeks ago. Where'd you see him? [SIGHS] [VEHICLE APPROACHING] Where were you? I've been calling. I'm sorry, honey. Did you hear about Tony? Yeah. We knew that he had this spot in his mouth, but... Mom. Oh, honey. Found out about it a couple of days ago. First, he couldn't believe it. Then he called Sam and Sam called me. I couldn't believe it either. And I just wanted to come home. I know, baby. I know. Did you come up in the morning train? Yeah. I'm sorry I wasn't here. [SIGHING] Oh, God. His dad's a mess. You know, some chili or something they can freeze. Sam said that Tony wants to see you. Okay. Let's go then. I'll just go change. No, they're not home. Sam said Tony wants to see you alone. Me? Why? He doesn't have a mom. If I were him, I'd want to see you too. Hey, Ned. Hi, Grace. How's he doing? Better than I am. Part of him knows that it happened, the other part just doesn't compute. He's sane, but I can't stand it yet, you know. Just can't look at healthy kids. I know. I know. Down by the beach. Hey, kiddo. Hey. How you doing? I'm a little bummed. Yeah. So, what's the prognosis? They're gonna have to operate? No. No? I'm gonna need some chemo or something. It'll be nasty for a while. Yeah. Well, the Yankees are just gonna have to wait. That's good news for the Red Sox. That's what I thought. [SIGHS] Listen. Hm? How much do you cost an hour? Well, that depends on the client. Why? Do you need a lawyer? Yeah. I wanna sue Federated Tobacco. Oh, darling. Darling, no. You can't do that. Why not? Because you can't win. I mean, as a lawyer, I just have to tell you. Nobody wins those cases. I mean, nobody. What about the Cipollon case? Oh? You know about that one. Okay. Fine. Well. They spent millions of dollars for a judgment of, I think, four or five cents. And then they lost it all on appeal. It's been years and years and they're still in the courts. Oh, and I don't have years and years. Is that it? [SARCASTICALLY] Thanks, Mom. If one person wins one of these things and sets a precedent, the entire tobacco industry would be flooded with suits. I mean, they're willing to spend billions of dollars to make sure that nobody wins one. So, some pig in a suit says, "Oh, thousands of them die of cancer, "but we're still in business, so that's a bargain." Yeah. Is that all right with you? No! No, that's not all right with me. But they all say that there's warning labels on tobacco, you know. They'll say that you knew what you were doing and you got cancer of your own free will. There were no warning labels on snuff when I started. Or Mack either. Mack? You know how old Mack was? He was eight. Who gives tobacco to an eight-year-old? We were at the circus and a guy in a cowboy suit came up to us. He was giving out free samples. Mack thought it was candy. He started to cry. Honey, wait a second. I don't know how to explain this to you, but you just can't prove that it was their tobacco that made you sick, honey. You know? I mean, it's not like, like, you know, being hit by truck or something. Yes, it is. It's exactly like being hit by a truck when it happens to you. Okay, okay. All right. Would like me to try to find some lawyers who do this kind of work? You know, so you can at least talk to somebody? How long will it take? You mean finding somebody willing and able to take this on? Yeah. Well, I don't know. I mean, I could make some calls. You know, I put tobacco here. And I got cancer here. Is that all right with you? No! No. I don't need to be told no by some lawyers who don't care about me. And I don't have time to get a lawyer for myself. Tony, you just need to... No, what I need is one lawyer who doesn't think that this is all right. [SIGHS] WOMAN: Uh, no, Mr. Chandler, he is... Ah, yes. I think so. Hold a minute please. Here you go. Thank you. You're here. I need that title search. Earth to Grace. Weren't you gonna pick up the mail's title search? Yeah. Um, Dick, I just need you to come and talk to me for a minute, please. I mean, Grace, for heaven's sake. A three-partner firm can't fight a multi-national corporation. I know. I know. We all know that. That's given. But why not? Because the law doesn't work that way. That's why. Okay. But it should, right? Oh, sure. Just clap our hands if we believe... Dick, come on. Listen to me. I'm talking about a boy I love, okay? His life has been destroyed and he needs me. He wants to give his life some meaning. Now, he's asked me to help him. What do I tell him? Grace. [SIGHS] I think you should go for a walk on the beach. [SIGHING] Oh! Get a good night's sleep. Have a stiff drink. I mean, this is just... It's just not a feasible idea. You know, it's just silly. It's silly? Oh, I see. It's silly. No, I mean it, Grace. It's ridiculous. Well, what did you think I'd say? I don't know, Dick. I guess, maybe I thought you'd say, "You're a fine lawyer, Grace, "and if this is really that important to you "then maybe we should really consider it." Yeah, well. Was just about to say that. But then I got worried about who's gonna be paying the salaries here. Who's gonna be paying the maintenance contract? The rent. The lease on the copy machines. If we take on this case that uses all our time, costs millions, and we end up losing anyway. And you expect me to litigate at this picnic? Me, fresh from my triumphs, arguing property lines and insurance frauds? It's okay, Dick. I can do my own litigating. Excuse me. I, uh, seemed to have dropped a stitch. Well, it seems to me that this comes down to behaving as if what we do in this life makes some difference. That's all. Are you going be doing grandstand speeches now like your famous husband? Ex-husband. And you can stop bringing him up. You can't litigate a case this size! You... You haven't been in a courtroom since you left Wall Street. I know. Thank you for reminding me. You hate confrontation. You made me a part... Dick, Dick. I resign. What? Your points are well-taken. But if this firm won't take this case, then I resign. I would like permission to use this office for the rest of the month before I decide where to go. Match point. So how are things at home? Oh, no. You don't. Ah, good serve! Game. You always do that, you know. Whenever it's a match point and I'm winning, you always ask me a question. Well, if you're dumb enough to answer... [BOTH PANTING] So, can I ask you now? What, now that I beat you? Sure. How are things at home? Good. I saw... I saw Tony. Did you? Tell me. Well, he looks great. You know, that's the weird thing. He looks like there's nothing wrong with him. So, what's the prognosis? Emily said he told her he was gonna beat it. No. Dad, they found it too late. He's... He's gonna die. Really? Really. Well, who told you that? He did. Sam. Would you mind an awful much if I gave you a hug? Motions for discovery. Yeah. You know, they're gonna jerk you around six ways from Sunday before you discover anything. I know. That's why I'm starting now. They got 40 little paralegal boffins just sitting around waiting to file counter motions. I know how big law firms work, Dick. They're gonna break your heart, kiddo. [SIGHING] I hope not. Me too. Let's keep it over there. Thanks. TOM: Hello. Henry? Anybody here? Good morning. Henry? HENRY: Tom! I'm sorry. I didn't hear the bell. It's all right. I found my way. It's good to see you. It's been a long time. How is Lorraine? She's fine. Fine. Good. It's a little hard to absorb you doing this all day. Hell, I remember when we were in New York together. Your first year with the firm. You were notorious for being the first one in in the morning, last one out at night. And when that poor bozo, what's his name, got cut off off with bleeding ulcers, you stood there, watched the stretcher go by and said, "Oh, good, one step up on the partner train." Well, it was. I got to try all his cases. He didn't die, did he? I think he did. Henry, do you mind if I get to the point? Why, Tom, you mean you didn't come all this way to see my roses? The point is Grace, as it happens. What about Grace? You know, we've been friends a long time. All four of us. I'm very fond of Grace, so is Lorraine. Henry, Grace has taken on a matter that's way beyond her. As her friend, I'm concerned for her. As an attorney, I'm distressed to find myself on the other side of the case. Frankly, I don't want to be the one to cream her. What is the case, Tom? She's suing Federated Tobacco. Is she? Henry, you know her. She's not up to this kind of hard ball. She takes it all personally. She's doing the wrong thing for the very best reasons just like the Exon case. She's gonna get eaten alive. Again. So, on the one side is Grace with her little slingshot and her bag of pebbles, and on the other side is a great, big law firm from Boston behind local Council. I was hoping for her own good that you could think of some way to talk her out of this. Now, that's a fascinating idea. What? The idea that I could ever talk Grace out of anything. Pretty smart. I thought they'd try to stall you. This is in German. I know. Do you know anybody who reads German? No. Is any of it in English? Mm-hm. You can't have this here, you know. It's not a joke. I know. I know. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Uh, I'm Elijah. What do you want? You Professor Cragin? Yeah. [SPEAKING GERMAN] I saw your sign. I come to translate for you. You're German. My father was. Right, okay. Uh, come in. Um, just stay right there. I'll be right back. German. [SPEAKING GERMAN] 1941. Cigarettes and lung crabs. Lung cancer. 1941. Right. Well, you know, tobacco companies claim under oath that they had no idea that tobacco was even bad for you before the Surgeon General's report in 1964. So, we're looking for what they really knew, and when they knew it. Yeah. You have more? Oh, yeah. [JOVIAL MUSIC PLAYING] God. Where did you get all this from? The tobacco company. Why did they give it to you? Well, they're trying to scare me off. Trying to show me they can swamp me. Can they? They're pretty close. All right. Okay, two candy coins. Oh, yeah? I'll see you and I'll raise you one. Hi, Mom. Hi, sweet pea. Hey, Mom. Sweet pea. Henry. Well, this is... Five cards done. Oh. Hold. [ALL EXCLAIM] Happy Halloween. Thank you. Black jack. Mrs. Cragin, this is my fiancee, Shelly Burton. Fiancee? Yeah. We decided why wait. Right. Well, congratulations. Nice to meet you. Oh, no. It's the big nurse. That time again, Tony. Not again, Big Nurse. You can all wait in the hall for 10 minutes. [GROANS] See you, kid. See you tomorrow. See you soon. Let me buy you a cup of coffee. I gave it up. Well, let me buy you a glass of milk. Be a good boy. Take care. I take it something is on your mind. You know, Grace, I waited a long time to see you draw your line in the dirt. [CHUCKLING] Oh! I didn't know my career was a spectator sport. Oh, I doubt it will be very sporting. Probably more like the Christian than the lion. Henry, you know I really hate being patronized. Well, it's a tough old world. I'm sorry. So, what's this about? I want to make an investment. In what? You need two more phone lines, you need computers, you need plane fares, you need a staff of at least five... Whoa. Wait. Who've you been talking to? Elijah. Now, you're gonna split any judgment with your client, right? I want 20 per cent of your net. Bull, Henry. This isn't your kind of deal. You like to win. Well, it's hardly your kind of deal either. Meaning? Meaning you don't like fighting, do you? It's a tough, old world. We change. Oh, do we? Why don't you win this one, Grace? I intend to, Henry. How much money do you need? Ugh. Over there. Have you borrowed? Yes. Have you mortgaged the house? Yes. How much money do you need? Okay, fine. Ten thousand dollars. That's not nearly enough. Wow. You can write a check for this amount? You'll have to hold it for a day so I can cover it. Okay. I'll write you a note. How much interest do you want? Grace, it's an investment, not a loan. You went to law school, come on. You're not buying the right to give me crap, Henry. I'm not buying anything. Kids put you up to this? Are you kidding? It'd be a hard fight. Excuse me. What? Excuse me. [SIGHS] So, this should just be Bill Clay and some stenographer. Bill's a nice guy. So just relax. If he asks you anything I don't you to answer, I'll object, okay? Mm-hm. Okay. Mr. Tabor, Ms. Cragin. Grace, hi. Good to see you. Thank you for coming. Hi, Bill. How's your back hand? Great. Listen... This is Tom Rothermill. Senior partner, Benz Rothermill. Yes. We've met. You're looking well, Grace. Thank you. Uh, Tom, is this some kind of a joke? These are some of our associates from the Boston office. They're just here to observe and to learn. As a teacher, we felt you'd understand. No. No, I don't understand. This is not a classroom or a zoo. I mean, this is pointless. These people don't have standing in Connecticut. Guys? Shall we begin? Tom? State your name, please. And you are the father of the plaintiff? How many children do you have, Mr. Tabor? Two sons, Mack and Tony. And how much junk food would you say they consume in a week? I don't know. What do you mean by junk food? Well, you're suing Federated Tobacco because your son is ill. And you don't even know how much junk food he eats in a week? I didn't say that. Sorry. Let's try again. When you son, Mack, was suspended from the middle school, did you punish him? No, I don't think I did. Your son was caught cheating on an exam, and you didn't punish him? [GROANS] Who've you been talking to? He was nine. His mother was dying. He was upset. GRACE: Counsel, do you have a question? My client's son has just returned from the hospital. He'd like very much to get home to take care of him. We have quite a few more questions, Counsel. Well, then may I suggest, Counsel, that we break at four o' clock and resume another day? I know a lot of you have to get back to Boston, but we're talking about a very sick boy here. We're talking about a nuisance law suit here. Tom? We can easily end at 4:00, Grace. No one here is worried about going anywhere. Great. Thank you. Mr. Tabor. Can you tell us what effect there was on your family when you learned of your late wife's love affair with Coleman Hughes? Objection! TOM: On what grounds? GRACE: He's harassing my client! BILL: Many illnesses are caused by stress, Counsel. Whatever has caused stress to this family is relevant. Counsel? Yes, Counsel. You're a filth-eating jackal. You know, Ned, if it's gonna be this rough, maybe we should just drop it. Can't. Yes, we can. Only thing Tony cares about, it's the last thing I can do for him. Hey. Are you sure? Mm. I thought burying Cara was the hardest thing I ever had to do. Uh, Mrs. Cragin. Hi, I'm Philip Brown. I'm an associate at Crane and Davis. Yeah? I'd like to come work for you. [CHUCKLING] Mr. Brown, I've had a very long day. Oh, Mrs. Cragin, I heard about the deposition this afternoon. Oh, yeah. You must be aware there is an awful lot of interest in this case in the legal community. Gossip, you mean, I'm sure. Look, Mr. Brown, I can't afford to pay someone of your level, okay? I'd like to work on contingency. Henry, what the hell is this? [SIGHS] It's a 1938 Brough Superior. No, no no. That's not what I meant. I meant, are you having your second childhood or what? That's right. I came to be burped. Brown, it's good to see you. Mr. Cragin. You've got quite a memory. What are you doing here? Well, I came to ask for a job. Oh. Did you get one? Uh, don't know yet. Grace, do you know the last time a tobacco company settled out of court was a 1948 class action when asbestos workers sued Bessemer Insulation with R.J. Reynolds as co-defendant? Yes, I did. Henry, what are you doing here? You're gonna hire this guy? That's none of your business. Look, Mr... Let me help you with that. No, thank you. Mr. Brown. Excuse me, but I've had a long day, okay? And I don't know you. Okay, listen to me. I'll just say two things. What? And the other is, please, feel free to check with Davis or anyone else about me. I'll be back. I didn't intend to settle, okay? Okay. Excellent. Great. Hey, Henry. HENRY: What did they do to you? They took my client's brains apart. Deposition is demolition... Brown's a good man. Hi, I'm Henry. Sandra. What kind of software are you using? Henry, stop it. I can't deal with you right now, okay? Just go home. Please go away. Did they use the wall of flesh on you? Did you invent that? It's effective, isn't it? Never seen so many pinstripes in my life. 'Course, Brown was a lot younger when I came up against him. One of those loose canons who still believes that law exists to serve justice. If you're trying to piss me off, you're doing a great job. No, I'm not trying to piss you off. I'm trying to join you. Join me? Oh, great. That's all I need. I thought you were off on some grand trip some place in your boat. I got tired of packing. Who's the beer for? Why? You don't drink beer. You don't grow roses. Is this for that guy I met at the benefit? Henry, I don't want this. I don't want a partner. I want 30 slaves with law degrees like Tom Rothermill has. Yeah, what you can get is couple of Kamikazes with nothing to lose, like Brown. Like me. Henry, look. This is my case, okay? I don't want you coming in here and playing with me. I don't wanna deal with you. I understand that and I don't blame you. But I think you need me. [SIGHS] What exactly did you picture yourself doing here? Anything you need. You'll be running the show in a New York minute and you know it, you can't help yourself. Anything you need. I need someone to take this suit to the dry cleaners. Take it off. PHILIP: So, did you speak to Crane and Davis? GRACE: Yeah. And I... So did I. Oh, good. On what terms did you plan on joining me? Contingency. What points? Ten percent. Five. Seven and a half. Done. He'd have taken five. Henry, shut up. I've one more question. Why exactly are you doing this? Well, I believe in the case. Right. And, uh... Well, I'm single. You know, I don't have any children. So, I can afford to take a flier. Right. And, uh, I used to work for Tom Rothermill. [BOTH CHUCKLE] So, I have a brief or two that I would just love to shove up his nose. Fair enough. Now ask him. Uh, why are you doing this? Well, Phil, it was, uh, the smell of those law books calling to me. The old war horse champing at the bit. Point turf. GRACE: Now, my question to you is, can you work with somebody that full of crap? Why is he doing this? I'll tell you what I think. I think he got bored with his boat, and pro bono work is all he can do. I thought you didn't talk to the kids about me. Why is pro bono work all that he can do? I retired from practice to spite my wife. Not me. The bad Mrs. Cragin. You really do stay in touch, don't you? I didn't know you cared. Oh, Henry. [GASPS] Ooh! The second Mrs. Cragin sued me for half my future income and won. That's not a bad payoff for two years of marriage, would you say? HENRY: You mean two years of me? Apparently she thought it wasn't nearly enough. So, I retired, making it half of nothing. [MUMBLING AND CHUCKLING] Oh, that's, uh... [HONKING] ELIJAH: Philip, check this out here. Grace, Henry, come here for a minute. I got this stuff from Tony's. What's up? Look at this. Spearmint. Wild cherry. Stuff looks like candy, right? Looks like bubble gum. This one has lower nicotine, so they can get you hooked and then you move on to the serious stuff. Yeah, all right. It's good enough for pew rows. Tony kept all this stuff in his tree house where his dad wouldn't find it. No warning labels. None of them. Look at this. How many 40-year-old men you know want a free bat and glove? What's up? Question. What precedents do you want to use for similar occurrences? Uh... Mm... Kim B., Preswin Gibbons, Ramos B., Liberty Mutual and look at McCormick on evidence, okay? Where do I find Kim? Uh, circuit 1983. Um, Elijah's got it. [KEYBOARD CLACKING] Whose beers are those in the fridge? Dick Chandler's. Your partner? Mm-hm. I thought he was married. Divorced. So how's he in bed? Dynamite, Henry. So, where is he? So, where is Priscilla? You know, I don't know about women anymore. It's like they're countries. They have treaties. Just like... Isn't that right, Philip? She seemed pretty fond of you. Well, she is. Well, good. Grace? Yeah? Have you seen these maps? What maps? Check this out. Oh, you clever duck. What? Oh, look. Cigarette smoking, common all over the country, right? But with snuff, there's a pattern. Suppose we could prove that the kind of cancer Tony has occurs in this same pattern. Wouldn't that be a smoking gun? Oh, man. Oh. Oh, well. How thoughtful of them to send these along. Mind if I had one of Chandler's beers? Ask him when you see him. Hey, Philip. You want one of Chandler's beers? Who is Chandler? Henry, stop it. Listen, how do we find out? What? Who's studying mouth cancer? In the morning, start calling the med schools, and the journals and... Hey, great work. How you doing, Claire? Gentlemen. If people get lost on the way out, they'll send a Saint Bernard, with a brandy keg. All right. GRACE: Oh, would you please cut the crap? We've got a court order to see these records. Owing to the private and sensitive nature of these records, Mr. Clay feels... Oh, please. Please spare us. How are you doing today? Love your stripes. Thank you. Henry, these are from 198... [WHISPERING] This dates back to 1985... These are from 1984, I think we should use... [WHISPERING] We'll see you in court. Your Honor, I move to be allowed a room alone in which to examine these personnel records. Objection. Your Honor, the records are sensitive and our client feels... Your Honor, I have to able to talk in private with my colleague about these materials. What exactly is your fear, Counsel? She's not gonna wrap her lunch in them. We want to be sure the records are not altered or purloined, Your Honor. Motion allowed. Give her an office to work in, Mr. Clay. Otherwise I'll allow her to take the documents home. Thank you, Your Honor. How you doing, Bill? We got it, we got it. We're almost there. How are you doing, Georgie? All right. It's my morning exercise, it's my coffee. Oh. No. Oh, no. This is rich. This is good work. Did you guys do this yourselves? You know, I've always wanted to learn woodworking, but they didn't teach that when I was at law school. Grace, do you have any green money? Yeah. Bigger. I don't have anything bigger. Grace. What? Bigger. Henry. Oh, stop. [CHUCKLES] You see? We can do this too. We just didn't realize it would impress you so much. I'll pay you back. Don't worry. It was worth it. [VEHICLE APPROACHING] [HANDBRAKE CREAKS] [SIGHS WEARILY] So do you want to drive this home and bring it back in the morning? No. Do you wanna know what I thought when I saw you at that fund raiser thing that night? Okay. I thought, "She's grown so beautiful and I wasn't there to see it." Do you wanna know why I came back here? Yeah, I do. I have wanted to know that. Do you think people change? I don't know. Well, they must. You have. What about you? About five years ago, I had an idea. I thought, "Why don't I stop being such an ass?" But then I thought, "Let's not go overboard." [CHUCKLES] Then after a little while, I had another thought. What was that one? That one was you. I realized that I was having conversations in my head with someone and it was with you. Well, what were you saying? I was saying, "I grew this rose for you." I was saying, "I like Brahms now." I was saying, "I'm so proud of our children." [SIGHS] I was saying, "I'm sorry." Do you want me to go? I don't know. I don't want you to go. [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] You know, I think that God said, "These two people have a lot to learn from each other. "And they're not gonna like it. "So, I better put something truly amazing between them to draw them together." Hey, you know, it's not easy to make love to a woman who is roaring with laughter. In fact, it's frowned on in all the sex manuals. [LAUGHING LOUDLY] [BOTH LAUGHING] "Ladies and gentlemen, tobacco is a poisonous drug, with absolutely no therapeutic value whatsoever." Henry. Grace. Hope you don't mind. No. Do you remember that Christmas? The last year we were together? Yeah. I knew I was losing the Exon case. Did you know, by the way, I took that case to try to... Did you know that it was for you? Is that true? Yeah. No, forgive me. I didn't know that. Well, remember? You hadn't bought any presents. So, you wrapped up your old leather flight jacket and gave it to Sam for Christmas? And the next morning, we asked him if he'd slept in it and he said, "No, because the leather squeaked." [CHUCKLES] Meaning that he tried. Well, that night, I asked you if you were sleeping with someone else. And you said no. Is that the truth? No. Oh, you're really into guts ball these days, aren't you? Yeah. I guess. Come here. [MOANS] [BOTH LAUGH] [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTS] Hi. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Hey, sweet pea. Hey, you guys. Hi. Tony, you're looking fine. Yeah. The jock from hell. [ALL LAUGHING] SHELLY: I think he should go punk. He's already got the hairdo. HENRY: Well, that's a good idea. You can get some big boots, a few studs and chains... Yeah, seven, eight earrings. So, how are you guys? Good. I'm good. So, you said you had some good news. Yes, yes. I do. Wait till you see. Now, this one you've seen. The map of snuff sales. This one, we got from a Dr. Lemmon. He's the scientist from San Fransisco I told you about. This one shows the incidents of mouth cancers in the US in the 1980s. Wow. Yeah. Wow. Right there. But we got one problem. We can't subpoena Dr. Lemmon. He's out of our jurisdiction and anyway, he doesn't want to testify. Why not? Well... Well, he lives in San Francisco. It'd be a long trip. Oh, no. He's testified before and it wasn't very much fun for him. Well, can I talk to him? Yes, that's exactly what we want you to do. We want you to call him. Tell him that we'll pay his expenses. Whatever he needs. If he wants an honorarium, whatever. I know what I'll tell him. What? I'll let him listen to my Brain in a Jar... [ALL LAUGHING] That oughta do it. All right, look. Here's his home number and his office number. Okay. We'll be in Boston tomorrow. We've got Culbertson's deposition. But I will call you tomorrow and see how it went, okay? All right. Okay. Now listen, honey, beg him. Whatever you have to do. Okay? Okay. Now, I'm gonna buy you a Red Sox cap, and I want you to wear it. I will. All right. Thank you. Okay. Bye. Bye. Have a good trip. Are you sure you should go up to Boston tomorrow? You got a lot to do here. I could handle Culbertson. Henry, I've been dreaming about nailing this guy. You've got to find a stronger witness on tobacco addiction. The one you have got, they'll have for breakfast. Look, I know seeing Tony upset you. Me too. But Culbertson is mine. Can't wait for the jury to see his face on video when I show him these maps. You're gonna show him the maps? Let Philip say he can find another witness. You're not gonna show him the map. What do you mean? Of course I am. I want the jury to know that this evil has a face. It's not just some big corporation in North Carolina. Are you sure you wanna show him the maps now? You don't wanna play your trump card too soon. Yeah, I'm sure. I think it's more important. It's bad enough we can't subpoena Culbertson. He gets to hide behind his lawyers in Boston. It's okay. It's okay. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] ...five and a half million dollars. [OVERLAPPING CHATTER] Grace. Hello, Tom. Grace. Henry. Welcome to the fray. Tom. I guess you know each other. No. Grace Cragin. Barbara Cragin. Hello. Barbara. Let me introduce Reg Culbertson, CEO of Federated Tobacco. Grace. Henry. How do you do? Grace. Henry. HENRY: How do you do? Reg plays a dynamite game of squash. Oh, I'm sure. Our associate, Mr. Nobles. TOM: Mr. Nobles. Shall we begin? Uh, excuse me. I, uh... I just need a minute. Okay. Henry? Excuse us. Of course. [DOOR OPENS] Excuse me. Sorry. So, that's the beautiful Barbara, huh? As in, "Honey, I'm working late on a brief." "Honey, I have to go to Houston with a client." Nobody said she was beautiful. Yes, they did. And she is. Do you have any idea how every much I never wanted to lay eyes on her? Oh, I think I can guess. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Is that why you tried to talk me out of coming to this deposition? I had no idea that Barbara... Is that why, Henry? Yes. You knew she was gonna be here? I didn't know... I knew she was with the firm. You knew she was with the firm? When you came to the hospital that day? No. When, then? When you drove up to my front door? Yes. But that's not why I'm with you. Oh, spare me. Spare me, please. Just, just... Just tell me one thing. What did "I'm sorry" mean? I don't know, Grace. Huh. You're gonna be all right? Oh, yeah. Sure. No problem. I just wanna reach down your throat and tear your heart out. But other than that, I'm gonna be fine. REG: Sorry. I don't understand the question. GRACE: Okay. What was your own personal compensation in salary, stocks and bonuses for the last fiscal year? I really have no idea. Would you say it was substantial? Oh, I don't know what you mean by substantial. I mean, say, a million dollars. Would you say that your compensation was in excess of a million dollars? Yes. Right. Would you say that you and your wife and children hold among you substantial amounts of Federated Tobacco stock? Yes. If you phoned a cell order to your broker this afternoon, you and your family would gross about seven million dollars by my math. Does that sound right to you? I haven't seen the paper today. Well, I'll save this one for you. And, Mr. Culbertson, what would you say was the market position of smokeless tobacco ten years ago? Ten years ago? Mm-hm. I'll read you the memo. [CLEARS THROAT] "Sales of snuff and chewing tobacco "have declined steadily since World War II. "It's perceived as old-fashioned, a backwoods habit. "We want to sell the advantage of tobacco in the mouth "instead of the lungs. "We hope to start a trend, the youth market." Do you recall this report? No. No, I don't. A trend, Reg, like hula hoops. Signed, Reg Culbertson, head of advertising, dated 1981. What's the salary of a head of advertising, Reg? Objection. But less than a million? Fine, fine. I'll withdraw it. Now, Mr. Culbertson, I want to show you a pair of maps. May I see those? [WHISPERING] [SIGHS] You were wonderful today, Grace. [LAUGHS HUMORLESSLY] Go to hell, Henry. [PHONE CLICKING] This is 308. Would you please send up four beers and a bowl of pretzels? And some aspirin? [SOBBING] Thank you. Grace, I came back for exactly the reason I told you I came back. When I saw you standing there... You came back because you wanted to fight this case for the pleasure of courting your wife. [SOFTLY] You're my wife. Oh, sweet talk. Oh, sweet. Sweet Henry. Nobody ever changes. Nobody ever learns anything. I'm getting out of here. No, wait. Grace. Grace, wait. Stop. Please don't go. We're not gonna get another chance. You know what hurts the most, huh? Even if you came back here because you hate her, your feelings for her are so much stronger than what you felt for me. No, no. I was wrong when I let you go. And I was sorry. I was sorrier than I ever could have made you hear. And I didn't know what to do. So I made more mistakes. Are you finished? For Pete's sake, Grace, the world is not a morality play. If only people whose motives were pure were allowed to make a difference in the world, we would still be killing wild pigs with stone axes. [ZIPPER SLIDING] I came back because I believe in you. That's not why. No. No, it's not the only reason. But it's the only one that should matter. Well, you want too much. I came back because I believe in you. I think you can win this case and I wanna help you try. I'm not strong enough for this. Nobody is strong enough for this. Well, you have changed! Yeah. For better or worse. And I am... Sorry. You haven't changed that much. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [PHONE RINGING] [SOBBING] That was Mom. What was it? Tony just died. When? Early this morning. What happened? He had another tumor. In his throat behind his tongue. Uh! Of course they couldn't operate. It was pointless. He couldn't breathe, he couldn't eat. Except for those tubes. Oh, I'm sorry. I know that you hate this stuff. No. That's all right. I want to know. Yesterday afternoon, his father was with him at the hospital. And he said to him, "Daddy, it hurts so much." And then he said, "Daddy, I wanna go home." SAM: [OVER SPEAKERS] Tony had planned to be this famous video artist once he finished playing baseball. And it was in Mr. Sector's class that we did video biographies. Tony thought a lot about today. He knew how hard it would be on his dad. And he didn't want this to be about Death. He wanted it to be about a happy life. So, if you'll excuse the screen in the church. uh, just to let you know we did exercise some restraint. we originally planned on having "Kissing as I'm Still Standing" as a sound track. [ALL LAUGH SOFTLY] Instead we're gonna ask you to please stand and sing Hymn 128. [ORGAN PLAYING] ALL: ♪ Abide with me ♪ Fast falls the eventide ♪ The darkness deepens ♪ Lord, with me abide ♪ When other helpers fail ♪ And comforts flee ♪ Help of the helpless ♪ O abide with me ♪ I need Thy presence ♪ Every passing hour ♪ What but Thy grace can ♪ Foil the tempter's power ♪ Who, like Thyself... ♪ "'I am light,' says the Lord.

"Believe in God, believe also in me." HENRY: Sam, why don't you guys take my car over to Ned's. I'll try to get a ride with your mother, okay? SAM: Sure. All right. Grace, do you mind if I ride with you? I'm gonna let the kids take my car up to Ned's. Sure. GRACE: I feel bad about leaving Ned with such a mess in the kitchen. HENRY: Well, you shouldn't. He needs things to do. GRACE: Mm. Does he want to go on with the case? More than ever. I'm the one who doesn't. It's just too hard. It made sense to me when Tony was alive. You know? I even felt that I was somehow keeping him alive. But now, I forget what the point was. I'm just tired of them always being ten jumps ahead of me. No, I am. I mean, do you know that there's 48 tobacco suits waiting to go to law and if we win, they file, and if we lose, they don't. Just convince yourself the fate of the world is riding on your shoulders. Don't, Henry, I can't... I'm sorry but you were the one who wanted to be a giant killer. How did you think it was gonna feel? I just wish I hadn't shown them those maps. You were right. No. No, you were. I should have waited. They've got experts to contradict my experts and everything else. So Lemmon's my whole case and now they know it and they're gonna kill him. I mean, they're just gonna eat him up. Grace, it doesn't matter because it's not a fair fight. Or hadn't you noticed that? The winner and still champion is always gonna be the team with the most money. But that's not the point. The point is that if you quit, the light goes out. Sounds like one of my speeches. Did you think I wasn't paying attention? I can't do this by myself. Philip is so exhausted, he looks gray. You want help? Mm-hm. But not from me. I didn't say that. But I don't want it to be the way it's been with us up to now. You know, I don't want any more of that. So, tell me. How has it been? You keep wanting me to be stronger than I am. Are you sure that's what I want? No. Well, I'm not sure about anything anymore. I just feel like you just keep doing whatever the hell you want. To prove that you don't need me. [SOFTLY] Grace. I need you. This is scaring me to death. Me too. [SIGHS] To fear. Here, here. [CLINK] And did you discover, Dr. Lemmon, that mouth cancer was evenly distributed across the United States? DR. LEMMON: No, we did not. You found that it occurred with frequency in some areas and almost never in others. That's right. Dr. Lemmon, this map shows the states with the highest concentration of smokeless tobacco use. Does this overlay illustrate the incidents of mouth cancer in the US? DR. LEMMON: Yes. And did you find a correlation between the sales of mouth tobacco and the occurrences of mouth cancer? An almost exact correlation. [CROWD MURMURING] JUDGE: Quiet, please. Could I have quiet in the courtroom, please? Uh, Dr. Lemmon, isn't it a fact that your mother's death from lung cancer occurred just six months before you switched your specialty from blood studies to oral pharyngeal cancer? Yes. And isn't it true that you feel vindictive toward the tobacco growers of America? Not the growers... Objection! Sustained. Doctor, wouldn't you say you've spent adult career attempting to dredge up evidence... Objection! Sorry. ...build a case against tobacco that you can bring into court? My mother smoked cigarettes. She didn't use snuff. And in 1978, Dr. Lemmon, did you place yourself in the care of a psychiatrist? Objection! Immaterial. [ANGRILY] It is not immaterial if this witness is a litigious neurotic pursuing a vendetta! All right. Could I be excused for just a moment? I just need a moment. We will recess for ten minutes. [GAVEL POUNDS] GRACE: Just a few more questions, Dr. Lemmon. How are you feeling? GRACE: I know you had a touch of the flu when you left California. We all appreciate the efforts you've made to be here. Your Honor... Now, Dr. Lemmon, I have just two things. How long have you been on the staff at Pacific Memorial? Eighteen years. And how long have you been Head of Research there? Is this a position generally held by a litigious neurotic? DR. LEMMON: It would be quite a difficult job for a litigious neurotic. It's a job that requires cooperation consensus building and a sense of fairness. Thank you, Doctor. Now, the defense has suggested in spite of what these maps show that there is no reason to suppose that mouth tobacco caused cancer in Tony Tabor. They claim that mouth cancer does not develop in so short a time or in so young a victim. Can you speak to this, Doctor? Yes, I can. In the 15 years that I have spent... We've accepted the doctor's credentials, Your Honor. In snuff users, with cancer like Tony's, twenty-eight percent are under the age of 30. [CROWD GASPS] Thank you. [CROWD CHATTERING] REPORTER ON TV: After hearing six weeks of testimony, the jury in the case against Federated Tobacco has been out now for eight days. Analysts feel that the longer they deliberate, the worse it looks for the tobacco industry. You wanna give me the odds she's got 'em? How about a dinner at Rudy's for four? No. I wouldn't give odds... I never thought she'd get this far. I'm telling you, I think she's got 'em and I'll tell you something else. So does Benz Rothermill. Grace. Henry. They're coming back in. MAN: Be seated. I have been informed that along with exhibits which were requested by the jury, a substantial amount of material which had been excluded from the records, has somehow found its way into the jury room. I understand that many of you have read these documents without realizing that you were not supposed to. All of us, Your Honor. JUDGE: And it's your opinion that you are no longer able to render an impartial decision. How could that happen? I have no idea. I'm extremely reluctant to grant a mistrial at this point. We'd place an enormous burden on the parties involved not to mention the court, to begin a trial of this magnitude over again. Therefore, I am going to direct you to return to deliberation. MAN: All rise. A stunning hitch occurred in tTabor Versus Federated Tobacco trial when it was discovered that the jury had somehow been given vital documents that they weren't supposed to see. It is not known exactly how this happened. Our information suggests that the mistake was made by a new clerk at the court in his first week on the job. JUDGE: Have you reached a verdict? No, Your Honor. We can't reach a verdict. And we ask to be excused. Has the jury been polled? Yes, Your Honor. I declare a mistrial. [CROWD GASPS] [GAVEL POUNDING] what the hell is this? I charge that you do not discuss your deliberations or anything that was said or read in the jury room unless and until such time as this case is retried and a verdict rendered. You are excused. MAN: All rise. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I love you. Grace. Grace. REPORTER: In a shocking conclusion to the Federated versus Tabor tobacco trial, the judge has declared a mistrial. [ALL CLAMORING] [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] Hi. Hi. Phone's ringing. I know. Every time I answer it's either the press or somebody I owe money. So, I stopped answering it. What happens if I declare bankruptcy? You're a lawyer. You're supposed to know that kinda stuff. Will they take away my credit cards for seven years? They sell my clothes? What? I don't think it's as bad as that for the honest but unfortunate debtor. Doesn't matter anyway. My credit cards are maxed. I suppose they'll want the mighty Volvo though. No. I doubt that. You're the only one that can start it. Uh, I put your computer and stuff in a pile in the kitchen for you. Thanks. I don't wanna leave. No? I do. But I can't afford to. I don't think I'll ever leave this yard again. Why don't you come home with me? Right now? Mm-hm. I got a load of laundry in the wash. You want me to see your house? Yeah. Why? Is it nice? Does everything have to be said out loud? [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] Hey, Henry. Right here. I heard what you said in court. When the judge ruled. Did you? Yep. Do I have to say anything about that? No. Grace? Right here. Are you gonna retry the case? Do I have to know the answer to that yet? No. I do know. I am. I am. [ROMANTIC MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING]
