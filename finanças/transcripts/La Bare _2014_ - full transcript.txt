They were a huge night club conglomerate. They had tried a male dance contest and best chest contest at a club called PT's. And then had subsequently done it in different places and it had just packed out like this. They went to their least producing club, which was this club, which was a topless club called La Bare, which means, "nude" in French or whatever. They go, "Okay, we're gonna try this male dance concept here. So, they stuck it in there and it just blew up off the planet. [male] It was big stuff in the 70s. I'm in the vending business, really. I've a pool table and jukebox business. That's what I really do. And La Bare started out, you know, as a sideline. You know, we're gonna build a bigger, better La Bare in Dallas. But when we opened the new La Bare with, you know, a big beautiful building in a new location, and it was almost like restarting the whole thing. And it did gangbusters. It's back and it's like it was in the 70s again. Girls were just rollin' in there. And, uh, eventually, I guess in 2001 was 9/11. And from the moment that 9/11 happened, you know, La Bare went to hell. I think for a while, La Bare just became cliché-ish, it had been around for so long. And your mom went to La Bare, you know? And it wasn't cool, it was, uh, you know, something that was old, old hash. Joe is a vending guy, like he told you, you know? And he didn't have time to really sit here and run the business. Alex got involved heavily. And, uh, ever since he got involved, you know, there was a turnaround happening. I came here and I saw a big opportunity. He's like, "Uh, man, I'm about to buy this big route. "I'm not going to even have a minute or anything, you know. I'm like, "I don't know, I guess." I've seen that good looking guys making good money and throwing that away on stupid things. If it's not a car that they can't afford or drinking, whatever they're doing after club. He really revamped the show and updated things. Brought in, um, a Las Vegas choreographer. [Alex] I start thinking that, you know, I don't need those kind of guys. I wanted guys that come in here, be businessmen, treat girls right, save their money, put the foundation for their future, and do something with.

He's, "All right, who wants me to transform this guy into a real entertainer? [announcer] Somebody scream. [cheering] And I'm looking all good again.

This is a manual that you give your entertainers on how for them to make money from exclusively as chewing gum to your hygiene. But this about bein' a businessman or woman in this business. And I actually drafted this for the dancers at La Bare. We have Master Blaster Strip-o-grams. We opened it in '89. We send entertainers out, male or female, to do parties. Bachelor parties, birthday parties, clubs. We have contracts with clubs and stuff. And I answer the phone. Ten to six. Six days a week. And I'm 78. [female] He even knows my 16-year-old now. She even calls him Big Daddy. [Randy] Well, first, I mentor their bodies. So, I get their bodies in shape so they make money in La Bare. Then as I'm mentoring their body, I start mentoring their mind. I tell 'em don't drink, don't do drugs. Don't excessively make this a party-- be a businessman. I can teach you how to make $100,000 a year. Do you want to do that? [female] I knew that Randy would do good in anything 'cause he doesn't drink or do drugs. So, my friend said, "I wouldn't have a son that did that." And I said, "I wouldn't have a son that didn't know how to take care of himself." So, I raised my boys with lots of balls. My name's Jeremiah Goud. I go by Austin at the club. Um, my routines are a vampire act, a bondage act, and a surfer act. I think acro would help. For acrobat, you know? I grew up very conservatively. Boys couldn't swim with girls. Boys had to swim with shirts on, et cetera. We didn't really listen to music. Uh, we didn't, I mean-- I was homeschooled till the seventh grade. [announcer] Come on, ladies, who wants to see that man totally nude tonight? [crowd clamoring] [Austin] And I didn't hardly have any interaction with other girls or guys for that matter, um, outside of church. Having never listened to music as a kid, really, I never picked up on beats. [fingers snapping] Just merely hearin' a beat to music. And so, at the club, it was really, really awkward when I first started. Nobody ever explained it to me. And it like, it's unbelievable that I missed this part of my education somehow. I think I'm a decently intelligent person, you know? But I totally missed it. So, I-- I went out on main stage one night and, you know, other guys, they clap to the music with the songs and everything. Get the crowd pumped up and goin'. And I start clappin' and everything. And I get offstage and the guys are just like, "What are you doing?" Because the beat's doing this and I'm over here be like. And so, for the first two months, uh, when I would go up onstage and it was really crowded and everything, there were some guys that'd be on backstages. And they'd start clappin' the beat of the song and I'd watch their hands to start clappin' to it. That was pretty funny. My big money-maker is the fact that I do aerial silks. It's two silks that hang from the ceiling, uh, that hang from a rescue 8. And just do all sorts of really cool stuff with them. I basically do really simple stuff at the club actually. But even the basic stuff for somebody that's never seen it, it's pretty impressive. Then again, seeing a 230 pound guy doing the splits in them is pretty impressive too.

So, 16, 17 I was a Boy Scout. Which is a little weird, most people go in young, but I went in late. It turns out my scoutmaster, he was a ranger medic. Like, I used to draw a lot when I was a kid. I was going through my drawing binders and I was like, "Mom, there's nothing in here "but tanks jeeps and helicopters. Like, really, how did you guys not see this happening?" I was always gonna join the military. There was no question about it. So, I was like, "I'm gonna go be a SEAL." And I guess, you know, one night he heard that and he was like, "Hey, come over here. Let me talk to you about these guys I used to be with." And he told me about rangers and I was sold. I was like, "That's what I want to be." We actually have a squad that's just the three machine guns. You know, where we'll set up positions and just lay hate. And as our guys are moving forward, we're shifting fire to kinda keep the enemy at bay. You know, it's kinda like a wall of lead, essentially. [machine gun firing] Then Afghanistan kicked off. I think the general story was that we were the first ones in. Which is awesome. Um, in truth, I don't know how much you can believe that. 'Cause you know how it is-- there's recon units, there's spies, there's all kinds of stuff. So, yeah, we could be like, "Yeah, we were the first in." But, I mean, who knows, there were probably guys there months before-- or not, I don't know. That's way above my pay grade, so... But one of the jobs of the ranger battalion is to airfield seizure. They'll pick an airfield. They're like, "Hey, that place is on the border. "We can land our C-17s and C-130s on it. We need you to make it ours." "Roger that." We make a plan, we fly in at night, we jump in and we secure the airfield. We eradicate anything that's on it. We make sure no one else can take it back. And we're like, "All right, bring in the heavy guns." I actually jumped into Afghanistan and into Iraq. So, I have what they call, uh, snake eyes. When you're airborne you have an identifier, which is a little parachute. And sometimes when you get X amount of jumps, they upgrade, it's like a star wreath. But when you do combat jumps, then you-- you get a bronze star as identifier. And then so, you know, a lot of people can get one. It's rare for some people to get two. I mean, that's the one thing. When you're in infantry like, you're a badass, you're in the army and everything's cool, but when you get out, you pretty much can be a bouncer, cop, or a body guard. So, I started working at UPS.

You know, the girls are sitting there looking for even not a relationship, but something intimate. I'm like, "Look mama, it's not gonna happen. "Sorry, I'm not gonna lead you on. "If you want to support me for being an entertainer "or give you this and that, that's cool. "But if that's what you're looking for, "I'd rather you go find it-- you know, someone that will do that for you." I usually come and hang out with Cesar. He's my favorite person here. I adore him.

Like, that is not even an issue for me. As soon as I walk out, I'm like, "Everybody is looking at me." Guys are looking at me, girls, guys at the bar.

I-- When I'm lonely or when I'm havin' a bad day, I can come here and I can, you know, say hi to the guys and I smile and I'm happy. And it, you know, cheers me up, makes me feel better, so... [Cesar] Somebody's gotta like you. I know some nights it doesn't feel that way. But, you know it happens to the best of us. You know, I can't tell you how long I've been on side stage for 30 minutes like, "Dude, really?" Like, I might not be the best lookin' dude, maybe I'm a little short, I don't know. I had too much salt this morning. I don't know, but like, "Damn, there's like, 400 of you. One of you's gotta think I'm decent lookin'." But, you know, it is what it is. So, that's how I got started. Not very ecstatic, I guess, but that's my life. Pretty simple and to the point. [male] What's up, fellas? Come on in. Welcome to my casa. I need to start fucking gettin' cardio, man. I can barely jerk off. Fuck me and fuckin' have a heart attack, bro. I'm just lazy as fuck, dude. I ain't doin' shit, man, I barely work out. The only reason I work out is because I want to get laid. And I don't even get laid that much no more. [chuckles] You know what I mean? Quit dancin', fuckin' stock went fuckin' to the ground. Like, I'll pound a chick for about two minutes, man. I'm like-- [wheezing] Be like, "Hey, go get me some water. Go get me a cup of water, hey, put some ice in it." I'm on film, right now? [male] What's that? Are you all recordin' already? Yes. Oh, shit. Okay, go ahead. Whoops-a-daisy. [Nick] Aw, yeah, check it out, we got beautiful Kristin celebrating her bachelorette party out there. Where's Kristin's bachelorette party? Make a little noise over there. Randy's actually how I got in the business, you know? I used to be a personal trainer at this gym. And I'd always see this dude workin' out, man. He used to trip me out, you know? He'd be in there workin' out, wearin' t-shirts with his picture on there and stuff. And he'd always come up to me and he's like, "Man, you're a handsome man. You ever thought about doin' any male dancin'?" "Fuck are you talking about, man?" He's like, "Yeah, you know, I own a club, La Bare." I'm like, "What?" You know, I'm thinkin' like, a bear, like a fucking God damn grizzly bear and shit. Girl, I heard this is your last fling before the ring, girl. You know what happens when the mare stays in La Bare, right? Dude, I made like, 300 bucks in ones, you know? I'm like, "Okay, I can do this." And then one year turned into like, twelve years. You know what I mean? Just flies like that. We got her a shy guy, ladies. It's his second week in La Bare, ladies. Somebody scream! [cheering] Biggest thing when you go on stage is to try not to look awkward. You know, you just gotta relax. Every movement you make just gotta be confident in what you're doing. The moment you start to think and feel awkward, that's when you look awkward, you know what I mean? And girls just sense that. Playboyreleased a magazine that says, "Playboy'stop 100 vixens." I looked at the back, I'm like, "I wonder if I banged any of these girls?" Because, you know, I banged a lot of Playboymodels. And then I look at the back and I was countin' through there and had little pictures of their faces. I counted seven girls from the "Playboy'stop 100" that I fucked, from different cities and shit. I'm like, "Fuck yeah." Bought the magazine and I was like, "It's awesome." Want to see a man taking it half way off or all the way off? So, even the simplest movements, whether you're takin' off your shirt-- You know what I mean, it's just gyrating a little bit, just-- just relaxing, being confident, making eye contact with the girls, That's what you gotta do to get these girls, you know, to get their attention. If not, then you're just another dude. This is where I spend a lot of my time back here. This is my man cave. Play these video games and have all these old-school Nintendo games. So, I've been collecting these since I was a little kid. So, my off days, I spend a lot of time in here. And this little guy right here, this is Tucker, man, this is my little dog. Little Ewok. He's part of the wolf pack, man, he's cool. Whole trash can full of beer cans I ought to pick up. Pretty crazy party night for, uh, the La Bare boys last night. This is my dining room, this is where I eat. So, that's it. [chuckles] It's my house. I went through like, a phase where I was a little promiscuous, you know? Back when I what used to actually get laid. For whatever reason, dude, I fuckin' downloaded some fart noises. I don't know-- I don't know why I did that. But it was like, five minutes of it, dude. Of different types of fart noises. So, I'm hooked with one of the hottest chicks I've ever hooked up with, dude. She's a Kansas City Chiefs cheerleader. This chick was hot, dude. So, we got the mood goin', man, fucking got the hotel. I got my laptop on. We're fuckin' gettin' down. Out of all the God damn songs it could have fuckin' shuffled to, third fuckin' song lands right on that five minute-- five-minute-long song of all those fart noises. She's like, "Why would you have that on your downloaded? What the fuck was that?" I'm like, "I don't know" I blamed it on Trent. [Nick] We met here at La Bare. He first started and I didn't really like him a whole lot because he was new. What did I say?Yeah. Yeah, he asked me how long I plan on working here. He's like, "How long do you think you're gonna work here?" I was like, "Man, I don't know, hopefully a while." And he just walked off. I had a group of guys come and try to start a fight with us. And, uh, this fuckin' idiot come to the rescue over there and kind of backed us up.Yeah. So, I kind of had a new respect for him after that. ♪ [Nick] Dude, he has pretty horrible taste, in my opinion. I don't really have taste. And I don't really have a particular kind of girl I go for, man, um...He goes for anything with big tits. Pretty much, man, so, I mean. You know what I mean? [Nick] I don't really just so much like wing manning for him. Because usually the chicks he tries to hook me up with are horrendous.Oh, come on, man. Their butt is pretty good, bro. He's jumped on a few grenades for me though, which I appreciate. We do, I mean-- And that-- the thing is now like, if we met, it's like, we'll have a girl that we want, but if they want to switch and they decide to change, we really don't give a shit. We're like, "That's cool too." Like, you know what I mean? So, the older we've gotten, the more we've adapted to it, I would say. You know what I mean? So, we got that goin' for us now, I guess. ♪ [Nick] When you get out in the real world and you do real work, you're like, "This sucks." You know what I mean? [Trent] Yeah, I did it for four and a half years, man. So, he decides he wants to be an electrician and-- Went to school, did the school. Moved up to Tennessee. Got my journeyman card. Yeah, in the real world it's a little different, man. You're not that cool dude onstage no more. You know what I'm sayin'? One time a friend of mine was doing a promo for, uh, like, Trojan condoms or something, right? And they came by and dropped off this box of condoms that probably had about-- Probably had about a thousand condoms in it. A friend, she happened to be in my laundry room when I was doing a laundry load. She looked down and the box was towards the bottom. She's like, "Oh, my God."Only been like, three months, man. [Nick] Everybody starts out at the bottom and ends up on the top-- it's just a cycle. So, like, when we were like, the main guys-- you know, we're seeing like, the guys now that are like, the top dogs, they were like, the new guys that we used to fuck with and haze. And now these guys are like, the top money-makers. And it's just like, "fuck," you know? Man, that was me three, four years ago. So, it's kind of funny, you know? [Nick] He's got a problem interacting with the crowd. So, let's see if we can get some girls up there to help him out. Come in to Father Free if you're good in bed and you can ride that shit till four AM in the morning. I want to see a show of hands. I need that whole party with their hands up. I need you to the front of the stage right now. I got one, that's not enough. I want all three of you. Bring your dollars with you, baby. No, no, I want that girl sittin' down too. There you go. There we go. You gotta adapt to the crowd. You gotta know what kind of music to play, what's out there, you know? Some days, you know, we might have 200 women and they're all wearing cowboy hats. We gotta gear it towards more the country crowd. You know, country music. So, it's a lot more involved than just going out there and takin' your clothes off, you know? [Randy] New guys over here in line, please. Every Thursday night, ladies, for the last 33 years is La Bare's best-dressed amateur contest. If you have somebody you know that takes to be part of our dance and dream team, get 'em to come on up to La Bare's house. We'll find out if they have what it takes to be part of the team.

Oh, here we go. [Chase] It takes a whole lot to really make it in this business. It's not just like, "Oh, I'm a good looking guy, I can do this." Uh, like, that's not-- you know? Because look at me, I'm not really that great looking of a dude. But, you know, I love the show aspect in entertainment and do okay. Like, it's-- it's more of a-- you have to have a mix. [announcer] All right, girls, let me hear you screaming! Hell yeah. [chattering] Fucking Larry Byrd, bro. [Cole] Amateur night is crazy, man. Like, I've seen some stuff over the years. I mean, dicks come out and I mean, these guys are just a different breed for sure. I believe Chase did amateur night, I think. You know, Cesar also was a, uh-- I think he did amateur night. [Cesar] You know, I did the typical amateur thing. Like sitting there with my socks on, trying to freaking take my pants off. [chattering] [Chase] There is nothing quite so bad as, uh, dancing around in your underwear in front of a bunch of women with no one coming to your stage. You know, just like, hanging out like, [snaps fingers] "How you guys doing," you know? "Everybody cool tonight? All right." God, he's got one move. That's his move. [chattering] You never know what to do up there. [Cole] I feel blessed to be able to do what we do at night. Because so many guys come every week and like, they want a job bad. Like, they would do anything. The routine, wake up at four o'clock, eat four egg whites, go to work out right after that. Do an hour and a half of running. Do legs, everything else, sauna.

Become a pro-- practice, practice, practice. Get up on that level-- practice.

You can only get the results on how serious you're gonna be. [Cole] Angelo was the alpha male. He made the most money, had the best body. Overall, like, everything that had the total package, Angelo was the best I've ever seen. When Angelo came onstage, I said these girls forgot about whoever they liked before then. [Brett] He never had to do anything but step out on that stage, throw his hands up in the air. And girls would just "whoo", you know, rush that stage. Frankly, I've never seen anybody else ever make that impact, you know, on the stage-- ever. [female] The latest show, it was in the shower. And I remember sitting in the back. Um, it was Alex the owner. And he said, "What do you think?" I said, "I can't think." I was like, I was gone. I was screaming just like everybody else. I mean, girls--I didn't see the shower thing. Oh, you missed out. You missed out. What was it about?Woo! Uh, well--She's getting like, hot flashes now. [Cole] You know, he's 6'3", 6'4", you know, 230 pounds, shredded. You know, and always smiling. I would just walk next to him and just watch even guys, you know, just like, staring at him like, "Damn, who's this guy?" [David] He was good at everything, it was nuts. He was a baseball player. He was a runner. He was like, a football player. He was a skateboarder, surfer. You know, he was a entertainer, a drummer. He was a swimmer. He dove like, 20 feet and he looked up at you. You're, and you're like this. And he's like "whoo", like this, all having fun. Just in, you know, just in the ocean with a mask. And he comes back up, take a piece of air, and comes right back down. It's like, it-- he was incredible. I never seen a man that was able to have four or five girls that he's sleeping with in the same room, get along, it's-- it's insane. We'd gone to pool parties and there's five girls there. And he's like, he's with all of them. And he's drinking, all partying, they're all high fives. It's like, never seen it before until I met Angelo. If anybody else did that, you would lose all of them, you know, for sure. And he made them all like, kind of coexist with each other. And I'm just like, "I don't know what you got, man, but if I could just have it for one day, wow." He was the real Magic Mike. Like Elvis Presley of La Bare. I don't know how else to put it. Uh, the best I ever seen, uh, was Angelo. Yeah, for sure. Um, you know, I never seen anybody like him before or after. Family and friends tonight are remembering the father of a six-year-old boy killed last night outside a Dallas nightclub. [Alex] He was like, you know, Elvis Presley. He's like Wayne Gretzky in hockey. He was, you know, Michael Jordan. He was of this business, in the world. Dozens of family and friends are gathered here where Ruben Riguero worked. A father of a six-year-old son was shot and killed in what the family says was a case of mistaken identity. ♪ I came home ♪ In the morning just a little bit ago ♪ [Cole] I woke up at like, 9:30 in the morning, uh, with like, 50 missed calls and like, 70 text messages. And my phone was on silent. So when I woke up like, it was still dark in the room. And my eyes were just like, still trying to register, going through these texts. And I was like, what the fuck is going on, you know? And I just like, dropped my phone and, um [sighs] I tried to calm everybody down. "You know, hey, it's okay, you know. "It's just a shot. "I've seen a lot of people got shot in Russia, "here, everywhere, you know. "Don't-- don't worry about, you know, Angelo's strong. You know, he's going to make it." When the doctor asked for the-- the family members, that it was us that showed up at the hospital. And then I told doctor I got to go see him. You know, I just don't believe it. I got to go see it. And, uh, and, uh, they let me. They let me come in and, uh, look at his body. Man, I just couldn't believe it. Dallas police continue their investigation. The family has created a fund to help out with... [JD] I was with him that night. It was just a good night. We all went VIP, got in the place for free. There was-- we had bunch of girls with us. "Come with us, come with us." "No, no, no, no." I didn't want to go. I said, "You guys be careful, I'm going home." [Cole] He was like, "Hey, Jerry," he was like, "All the guys from Miami are in town." He was like, "Let's go, let's go to afterhours tonight." I was like, "Hell no, man. Uh, I can't stay out all night." I was like, "I got Tristan, you know, my little boy." And he was like, "All right, Jerry." He was like, "I'll holler at you later." I brought everybody a big handle of tequila. We were passing it around, having a good time. [Wesley] They had all gotten together for a group picture. Shortly after that there was a scuffle that ensued. Some guy walked up and grabbed one of the guys' girlfriend's butts. He grabbed me. Like held onto my arm, wouldn't let me go. And so Elvin walked up and like, yanked us apart and pushed me away. The other guy came up to me and got in my face. I was like, dude, chill. I recognized his face, okay? This was a guy that used to come into the fair room when I was there. He was one of those guys that we knew was a pimp. You know, like he had girls working the club. And he was known to be a drug dealer. He say something like, you know, you know, some bad word, "Fuck you, asshole." I don't even know what he said. I said, you know, "Fuck you too," whatever. You know, just going to go there. Grabbed the girls, I went there. Branagan came in the dance floor and starts talking to Elvin again. And before you know it he-- The guy just fucking punched me. The bouncers came in the club. They came in, they separated everybody. They was talking to everybody. All of a sudden Branagan came across, ran, and hit Angelo in the face. And then the-- that's when the bouncers, they went out on him. The bouncers threw him in the ground, kicked him. They-they-they hit him. At one point they grabbed him and threw him so hard, he landed-- his neck landed like, in a chair, in a rail. I asked Angelo, "Are you okay?" Because he got hit in the face. He did his little thing like that that he does, his little shake, handshake. He goes, "psh," that's nothing, Johnny. We stayed there about 30 minutes. When they went outside, this guy had been sittin' in his car for 20, 30 minutes with-- just waitin' for them to come out. So Elvin's walking, looking for his car. And this guy's stalking Elvin. I kind of look at him and he's like, "Come on, come on," or something like that. I'm like, "What, what?" And so he kind of sees me and he goes back to his car. And then he turns around and he says, "Y'all want some of this?" It's presumed that the shooter in this case, Mr. Hopkins, was acting reasonably if he is in his car or his home and someone is either trying to get him out of his car by using force or trying to break into his car by using force. I see three of the guys at the car are La Bare guys with their hands on the car, shaking the car. Angelo approached the car where Branagan was sitting. Uh, flicked him off. Because obviously he got punched in the face. And he-- and he slapped the mirror off. And then the guy rolled down his window and said something like, "I got something for you." And Branagan took out the gun and shot him in the chest. I was right there when it happened. Like, directly behind him-- caught him and everything. They drive off. We get up and I look at Angelo. I'm like, "Angelo, are you okay, are you okay?" Because when he got hit, he just kind of did that. So I didn't know. So I said, "Are you okay, are you okay?" And he just turns around and gives us the biggest smile. And starts to go the ground. I just don't get how you can have, uh, two assaults on a family member on a record. You know, domestic violence against your own family members. Uh, have a possession of a switchblade, a DWI, and be able to drive around with a gun in your car. I just-- I don't get that. It was a stupid move for the guys to start hitting his car. But he could've driven off at any time. He drove off immediately when he-- when he shot. Talking to like, the police people, they said that the guy's car wouldn't turn over. It wouldn't start. And I just have to call BS on that. Yeah, it's-- 'Cause, I mean, he was never trying to start the car. Car was on. I told this to the DA and the DA don't-- Dallas DA, uh, has been in the paper for being investigated for corruption. I don't know, I heard from other lawyers that, um, this guy was probably, uh, an informer or some shit for drugs-- I really don't know. The first thing they were asking me-- They asked me so many drug questions. Does Angelo sell drugs, does he, does he do drugs? I mean, it was like drugs after drugs after-- I said "No, this is not drug related at all. No, they don't know each other." Whatever happened, it was bullshit. The next day he was bailed out. Couple of months later, he's free. Done-- nothing-- case dropped. It didn't even make it to the juror. In fact, the DA told me that the evidence that he had could not-- he wouldn't be able to convict him. Who knows? Maybe because we're dancers, strippers. Nobody cares about a stripper. Me and David were trying to organize a protest, you know, to the city of Dallas. This guy, this Branagan Hopkins guy that murdered Angelo, he wrote me on Facebook. Like, I had to make a police report about it. He was just like, "You're, uh, funny. Your protest wasn't much of a protest, now was it?" And he was like, he goes, "Oh, you're so tough," this and that. He was like, "You're a character, girl." Man, I was so mad. Like, I was shaking at my desk like, at my day job, looking at this fucking message on my phone. But you have to some sort of remorse that you killed somebody. Even if there's no criminal liability. There should be some remorse. Just so sad. I believe he-- he was gonna be something big. He made this video on YouTube. It's called Ruben's Message. It was like, you know, sittin' like, how I'm sittin'. And he was like, just tell people, you know, what you want them to hear. You know, like a quick somethin'. And he says, uh-- [Angelo] My name is Angelo Riguero. I'm from Venezuela, 27 years old. He was like, "You know, every day I wake up and I give thanks to God, you know, for everything" and I'm always grateful to have friends, you know. I'm always grateful to have people to help me. Always grateful to have a good family in Venezuela that I love to help. He kind of stumbles across his words a little bit. And, you know, he said, uh, you know, if anybody ever wants to talk to me-- If we ever, I ever get to meet anybody out there, please come and ask me about anything. I love to talk. He, uh, was a great guy. In my opinion, he was, uh, the best male dancer in the world at the time what happened. [clears throat] If I had a son, I'd be proud for him to be my son, um... So, basically, he's one of my mentor. Like, you know, he gave me a drive to like, get up in the morning, like go do stuff. What the hell are you doing, dude? You don't ever do this. This guy. he was going to, uh, let me be one of his, you know, partners. Like, you know, make money. And, um, yeah, he was just-- Ah!, man. [Cole] That's why I have the broken heart. You know, he was always like, "Man, you know, "I've never really been in love with a woman. "So, I don't know what that feels like to be heart-- broken hearted." You know, but my best friend being murdered like, really killed me. [Angelo] I love life in every way possible, okay? I love life in every way possible. Just be happy in life, man. Just be happy in life and be grateful about everything. You never know when it's going to end. If you put a smile on your face, you put a smile on everybody's face, you know? So, just keep it positive. Shit. [JD] I think we're the cowboys today. Take Channing, show him how to do these. And, uh, you know, we go in. We got a little skit that we do. Um, unless it's at a restaurant. Then we just kind of go in and start dancing real quick. But if it's, uh, somebody's house, we go in kind of-- They're kind of cheesy skits, but it gets the girls involved. Dance for about 30 minutes, take some pictures, you know, get paid and come back to work. [Channing] I've done two. It was like a bachelorette and bachelor party all in one, so, it was really awkward. Because like the husband was like right next to me while I was dancing on his, well, to-be wife. I was dancing on her and he was like right there. I'm like, "This is really awkward." I didn't really know what to do. [JD] You got some swingers? No, they weren't even swingers. It was just really awkward, they were kind of ghetto. And I didn't-- didn't really know what to do. [JD] I absolutely love swingers. I make the-- so much money off swingers. Like, you come in. Alex told me how to do it. Like, you come in and everybody wants to stay away because there's a guy. I'm like screw it. So, I go up, I introduce myself to the husband or boyfriend or pimp, whatever he is. And then after that, I'll always dance on the stage right in front of him. And then from there, they'll come up and get a dance. I charge both of them. You know, they always want VIP so he can watch, and I charge both of them. Like, if a dude wants to watch, he's paying. So, take care of that. I gotta find somebody's pants to wear. Laurie, we're gone. Hi.Hello. [cheering] [clamoring] How are y'all doing? Want some? Woo-hoo! Cowboy you're looking for-- your name is Bronco Billy. I'm looking for a little filly. Well, like I said, my name's Bronco Billy. And I'm here looking for a little filly. I need somebody to come and work the ranch with me. Who'd like to work on the ranch? And you're a ranch foreman and you go in there and you're looking for somebody to work the ranch. And you got to make sure they can ride a horse. What about you? You like to work outdoors? Sure.Who's Tiffany? Tiffany's right here.Hi. Shit. [laughing] [cheering] Happy birthday to fucking you. Ow.Are you okay, sweetie? Yeah. [laughing] Let's get you up. Yeah, I'm okay. [JD] Let's give her another drink. Anybody know how to ride hard and fast? You teach them how to ride one soft and slow, hard and fast, and then both. [JD] Channing's gonna demonstrate hard and fast. You get the arms out wide. Get your arms out wide. Oh, that's not fast. [clamoring] [JD] The other way is soft and slow. Who thinks they like soft and slow? [female] Everybody likes it. Yeah.We're ladies. It's so sweet. Why wouldn't you like it? I can do this.You like that? Yeah.Like that? Yeah.You all right? [JD] I just kind of go with the flow. This is how I started making my money. Because I was real nervous onstage in the beginning. But the strip-o-grams I was pretty good at. So I kept building those up. And then that'd kind of help me relax when I came in the club. Plus when people come to see you after the strip-o-grams, they're going to tip you more. So, I get probably 90 percent of my parties coming back. You know, the main goal is to get them back in the club. You do that and then they just keep coming. [JD] You're just acting, you know? Just having a good time with it. They have a good time too. [female] So tonight, La Bare? [clamoring] [Bo] You know, it's funny. Alex, like, he'll always say girls are a dancer's worst enemy because, you know, it always happens. You know, girls come, they talk to the dancers, they fall in love, whatever, they leave. So, I mean that's kind of-- I guess that's kind of the truth, you know? I mean it-- and it's-- I'm a big family man. So, having a baby, that was the big push to kind of, you know, could I be a dancer and have a family? I think so, I definitely know that could happen. I mean, hormonally at the time, I think she was totally opposed to that idea. I mean, I don't know if she still is or not. But, I mean, it's-- it's kind of at the time that's what kind of had to be done. I just needed to kind of back out and take care of this. So... ♪ God bless a man. [cheering] [female] You know, you-- you go home to-- to Mr. "You Think It's Right." And then you go out to the club and you find 25 of-- man, I've never seen any of your kind here ever in my life, except for TV. And then, well, I guess you change your mind. I don't know. These girls are used to the picket fence with their 8s and 7s and 6 1/2s. So, when you have 10s in front of you and you have a bunch of rumple and stuff, I mean, what do you want me to say? I was okay with it for a while. And then once I got pregnant with her, I tried to be okay with it. But hormones. I was like just, I wasn't having it anymore. It was late hours and I was at home all night by myself. And he was at the club and I was kind of jealous, I guess. It just-- it definitely changed when I couldn't go up there and like, hang out with him and party with them after. Like it just kind of changed. [crying] Addie.I know, right? It's terrible. Can I go?Let her check. One, two and three. [cheering] [JD] I mean, that's normally when I'll pitch like, bringing them back to the club. And free bottle of champagne tonight. [cheering] Does this job ever get old? No, it don't get old. Only 401[K] we got is pussy. [laughs] That's it. [Wesley] I think that saying that I said was, uh, "Nothing is right or wrong, only thought makes it so." As a young man, you're out testing the world. You're-- It's like a buffet and you're trying, you're sampling everything. There comes a time where we shift. Life becomes more subjective rather than objective. If you think about an infant, everything is an object and they always want to know what it is and they only know it by putting it in their mouth. And they view themselves as the center of the universe, which is kind of the ultimate selfishness stand or selfish stand. It's-- it's all about me. And then there comes that point where you have a reckoning. Because you know. And then your life shifts and you become subjective, where you say, "I'm not going to touch that burner "because I already know what happens when I do. "It burns me. It's hot. I feel pain from it." For me, that moment came. I had a child and I realized in a moment that I had gotten so good at my act that I believed that I was really that person. I had a tipper that used to come in. We used to sell a stack of $100 just in singles. And it'd have that ribbon wrapped around it. So, she'd get like, five or seven of those. And when I'd be up onstage, she'd come up and slap 'em down right on stage. And it was like she was telling every girl in there, "He's mine." You know, what are you gonna do? Somebody lays that money at your feet, this is it. So, I finally one day said to her, I wanted a Harley. And I said, "You're gonna buy me a Harley." I said I've been saving everything that you've ever given me. And she says, "Well, how much have I given you?" I said, "I've got six grand." And she was completely taken back because she didn't realize she had given me that much. So, soon as she realized that she was gonna buy that Harley, and that I was saving that money, she started bringing more in. She was bringing in thousand a week. And every week she'd be, "How much do you got now? How much you got now?" And I got up to 12 grand. It was 12,700 for the bike when I bought it. And, uh, that's how I got the bike. [Randy] The ladies who'd been my clients or my fans, psychologically speaking, what they think they are to you, what society thinks they are to you, and what they really are to you is such a wide range. But one lady tipped me a $75,000 cashier's check. And then I made $10,000 in cash that night. [JD] I was brought up, you know, military like family. Very much like, "Yes, sir, no sir." This is how you treat a woman and everything. And you kind of have to throw that out the window and realize that it's like, fantasy land. And so, it's okay. I mean, you're not-- you're not supposed to lie to 'em or anything like that or act like you're dating. That's when you're kind of crossing the line. Some guys do it, some guys don't. But to get used to a girl like, asking to pay your car payment or pay your bills, that's kind of like, it's kind of weird. But I haven't said no yet. It's just this big game. It's a big game that you make money off of. [Koven performs "Wake you Up"] ♪ Before I know ♪ I'm falling down ♪ I wanna wake you up ♪ At the end of the night [JD] You don't fuck your money. It's the saying, "You don't shit where you eat." Once you like, hook up with a girl, she's already got everything. The fantasy has been fulfilled. Now why would she ever come back and tip you? So, that's why you only do it to girls that you know aren't coming back. Hey! [female] It's got to be hard for a man. I mean, it's like you have a sweet tooth and you get stuck in a candy store every day, you know? [laughs] Eventually you're going to try one of the pieces of candy. [JD] Three girls in a night, four girls in a week. Whatever you really want to do. Then you can start forgetting about the money. So, you kind of have to refrain and realize that, "Hey, I need to not sleep with every girl." [Brett] My money went down because when a girl would buy, want to buy you a shot because, you know, "Hey, take a shot, take a shot, you know." And I like, "No, I'm-- sweetie, I'm dieting. "I can't take a shot right now. I got this big competition coming up." They're like "Oh, okay. I'll go give it to somebody else." And then they take a shot and they'll get lap dances and stuff because they're all having fun, partying and stuff. And I'm sitting here serious and, you know, I got a goal and a dream and stuff like that. So, it was hard to juggle the two. I didn't want to be an alcoholic. I didn't want to drink every night. You know what I mean? I didn't want to be a old cowboy. [Randy] My knees and my hips and my ankles, even down to the bones of my feet get-- tend to get the tendinitis and inflamed so much that sometimes I need to come over here and cryo three times a week. It's taking his core temperature down to 300 below. It makes his body believe that he's dying. So all the cold sensors go off. So, when he's gets out and the body's not dying, it sends all of the oxygenated brain chemical blood out to save his life. It's to heal any injuries that he has. [Randy] La Bare Dallas opened, November 1, 1978. My first day of dance was February 12, 1979. Have you ever seen the movie Gremlinsafter they get wet? You open, you just open the door and they're, you look in and they're, they've all drank water or got water dripped on them, fluid, whatever. And there's one in a blender upside down, turning. You look up here and one-- three are on the ceiling fan. You look over there. One-- another one's swinging another one by its butt. I mean, that's what it was like. Fun stuff, good-looking guys and built guys. Ex-athletes, football players, track guys trying to make a little extra money. My second step in the door, I just stopped. I'm a fairly physically big presence. And so, I just stopped there like this and I'm looking. And a girl walks up and goes "Are you dancing tonight?" Mmmm! Like that. And I went, "Yeah." Girls feeling more independent, feeling a little more independent and, uh, just feeling like, uh, you know, they had their rights and it was their time to come party. They wanted equal rights and equal-- equal naked asses. [female] We're gonna put filler in Randy. So as we-- as we age or work out or diet really heavy, we get really hollow. So, it's kind of like a build-a-bear. We're just fluffing everything back up. Like artificial fat would be. Fluff me. [Randy] Being able to lean down like I do. You know, I know it pretty well. I get pretty lean. And the lines in my face would just get too, in my opinion, too deep. And, you know, this is just healthy. Uh, you know, if you can afford it, which it's not that expensive. I want to spend money and reinvest money into myself. I feel, make yourself feel better. [female] People come in and they like to look a little younger, maybe a little fresher. And so it kind of changes their life. And of course, I can't stand aging myself, so... [Randy] Now Master Blaster, being it's since 1979, it can only come from one place. Because Stevie Wonder hadn't written a song yet. I don't even know if he was singing or probably just barely started. I was in competitive bodybuilding as a kid. I started reading the muscle mags in third and fourth grade. So, I knew Arnold Schwarzenegger was the guy, you know, you wanted to emulate yourself. And his trainer was, the guy who put him together was Joe Weider. And his nickname was the Master Blaster. [announcer] Here he is, ladies, The Master Blaster. Somebody scream! ♪ My very first time I was 18 years old. And we went for a bachelorette party. And I went in with my friends and there was Randy Master Blaster. [laughs] So, I went and did a contest and I got third instead of first. So I was really depressed. So, some of my football buddies from high school got me a nice t-shirt. It had a Superman emblem on front like, "We think you're great." And my nickname on the back. My real name and my nickname, which was Randy Master Blaster. So, I was wearing that shirt that night. Just so happens that's the one I'm wearing. The manager from La Bare goes, "Hey, we're doing the amateur contest, you going to do it?" I'm like, "Well, no, I wanted to be a waiter." He goes, "No, we don't need any waiters or bartenders." He goes, "If you want to work here, only job you have is dancer." ♪ So, as soon as I walk out, for whatever reason, you know, the cowboy hat, muscular guy, whatever, they just went "waahh." Like a yell, screaming so loud. "Ladies, how do you like this guy?" It was just like the whole place just went "waahh." It's surreal. You just get-- It'd be like Emmitt Smith feels when he was running for a touchdown in the Super Bowl. You just feel like you're unbeatable. Of course, I smoked everybody. I made $283 in six minutes. So, I didn't even know what all I had. Like, other guys were making five, ten bucks. And then girls just were throwing money and sticking it on me like bum rush stage. They were climbing up on stage and the floor guys were pulling them down. It was basically like a movie. I thought I was in a movie. When that adulation is given to you as an individual, it feels so good. It's almost like a-- it's an aphrodisiac, almost like a drug-- you want that. You get it. You feel it. And, I mean, that was my buzz. My grandfather said, "Go out and sweep the yard. I want you to rake up all the leaves." So, I go out there and rake the leaves. When I was a young guy, I raked them all up and they were in piles. I said, "Grandpa, I'm finished, can I go play?" He looks outside and goes, "Did you bag the leaves?""Oh no." Went back outside and bagged the leaves. So, they're all over the yard in bags. "Grandpa, I bagged the leaves, can I go play now?" He goes, "Did you stack the leaves on the street so the trash can pick them up?" I took my family ethics and put them to business that I had passion for, that I loved, that I love to this day. And I put that package together. I wasn't the best looking. I wasn't the best built. And God knows, I'm not the best dancer. So what he teach me? He said, "Don't do anything half-assed. "If you're going to do something, "be the best you can personally be at it, if not the best in the world." I think that's it. You were such a good boy. Thank you, thank you. Woo! 205 pounds of twisted steel and sex appeal. 33 years strong, thank you. [whistling] [male] Who got burgers? [JD] Lettuce, tomato-- this is a regular one also. Who had a regular?Me. Did you have a regular? [male] That's a regular. This regular?Yeah. Is it good? I haven't tried one yet. I haven't got to try the meat. It's greasy. ♪ ♪ I just found myself like, damn, you know, I'm a dad. You know, like, it's-- it's crazy. You know, like, but it's the best feeling in the world, man. Like, you come home stressed the fuck out. And I would just put my hands like, in my face. And Tristan come put his arm around me. He's like, "It's okay, daddy," you know, this and that. And, you know, just makes everything, you know, worth it. It's the best feeling in the world. He's like, the only person I like all the time. You know? So... [Ace] That's life. Life is a bitch with a pretty-ass face, you know? You could let life fuck you or you can say stop. I'm a fuck you back, life, you know? We're boxing. We're doing this shit. You ain't going to get the best of me. [Nick] We come to work and that's like, the highlight of our night, just coming to work and just fucking cutting up, man, you know? Just making each other laugh and shit. So, that's what's cool about having a job that you can just go to every day and just laugh. You know what I mean? And just have a relaxed atmosphere and so, it's pretty great. It's the best job in the world, man. I'm cooking for Randy the Master Blaster. We got pork chops, rib eyes, tilapia, and pork loins.
