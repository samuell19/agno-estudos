THE SQUAT I think I got everything. Don't you think that's a bit too much? Two months away from everything, that's a lot to plan for. Well, it's not like we are going to Alaska. Normandy is cold and humid in the winter. And you know I very much prefer the sun. Bad news, darlings. A train strike? Rosa won't be able to look after the apartment. Her father had a stroke so she went back to Lisbon. We can't leave it like this. Well, let's just stay here. No way! You want to get burgled again? What about you? I'm leaving tomorrow to visit my son in Colmar. I'm sorry. I have to go, girls. See, that's a sign. We shouldn't leave. Enough with that. I have a solution. -Who? -Well, my granddaughter. Which one? Julie, the second one. You've met her. She is serious, calm and discreet. Discreet. You can say that again. I think I saw her once in the past 10 years. Well, you should invite her more then. You don't want family here. That's because they always have a favor to ask. Julie, it's your grandmother. -Maryvonne, yes. -Hi, Grandma! No! That was a gift for me, not for you! OK? If you want to go, leave everything! What a jerk! -Really... -No, not the small blue robot! No! No! Are you renovating? My small robot! No! Yes, a bit. Really? I have a favor to ask. You don't care about this, right? You will pay for this! I swear you will! An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth! You never even used that thing! -Exactly! -Say, darling, could you come to the apartment real quick? Yes, Grandma. I'll be right there. You know what? Just keep everything, I don't care! My fish, this jail, your TV, and your awful tummy! My tummy? Now that's fantastic! That's because you can't cook anything nice! Well, now you'll get off the sofa to cook things for yourself. I'll come back when you calm down. Are you kidding me? If you go, don't ever come back. I promise. -Really? -I promise. So you're leaving for good? I'll start working out. Too late. When the soil starts to dry, water it with half a glass. This one needs three drops of fertilizer and half a glass of water. And this one is fantastic, very economical. It doesn't need anything. Just like your grandma when it comes to drinks. That's her way of telling me she loves me. Coco, let's go now. We are going to be late. But I have to explain things to her or my plants will die. You wrote everything down, -she can read. -Listen. She is young and carefree. I love bonsai trees, it will be fine. I'm forced to believe you. Shall we? One last thing. If you must play this... Cello. Yes, the big thing. Do it in the bathroom. And close the door. It's for the neighbors. This is a quiet building. It's like a convent: plants, soup, a prayer, and it's bedtime. If you're a nun, then I'm the archbishop. Want me to drive you? We'll be there in 10. I just want to be on time. And alive, if possible. Thank you, sir. It's heavy, right? Thank you for bringing only one anvil. Look at this weather! Don't worry. It won't last. It will rain soon. This silence is delightful. You'll see, this tranquility will do us some good. Nothing could be calmer than this, except for a grave. Come pick these up when you're done. Right, it feels good. It's very nice. Girls, I was thinking... Maybe we should talk about... -One moment. -OK. Hi, little guy! Are you alone? What's your name? My name is Julie. Do you like music? Are you on vacation? Juju, are you coming? Yes, I'll be right there. You can come in if you want to listen. Say, you're a heartbreaker. Are you her new fiancé? You chose well. He is cute. See you soon. Come in, OK? Right. So we were thinking... Well, you were thinking... Here, look. Marsupilami. Forty-two points. No! We can't use proper nouns. That's a common noun. -Since when? -Today. I don't know it. Why do you always vex me? You're cheating. -You are. -I am not. What is this word, then? Bye, girls! -Nice, we finished early. -Yes, it's great. Need a ride? No, I'm meeting David at the Bastille station. Right. I need to get clothes at Martin's, can you help me? Sure, I can ask David too. No, if he sees me with another guy, he will lose it. -Are you sure? -Yes. -Will you be fine? -It's OK. -Good luck. See you tomorrow. -Good night. What are you doing here, cutie? Come here, cutie. Come in the warmth with me. I will feed you if you're hungry, OK? We will be happy here. Agathe? I was going to call you. It's a pleasure! A big apartment with no jerk inside! For sure. Say, remember the kid we saw hanging around the barge? Did you see him with an adult that looked a bit... homeless? No? Never mind. I'll explain another time. Have a great night with your boyfriend. OK? Take care. It's not raining anymore. Shall we? You can't go out like this. I'm not feeling well today. And it will rain again in five minutes anyway. It will do you some good. No. You know what? Let's walk to the Robichon's family farm. Yes! Let's buy some eggs and a chicken. And visit the Pignon, they are organizing our trip to Fécamp after all. My heart is beating so fast, I don't know. I feel like my head will explode. You go. It's the hooch you drank last night. You snored all night long. I never snore. Yeah, right. I need to sit down. Really, you go. I feel under the weather. Should I call a doctor? No. I will call one if I don't feel better by this afternoon. I just need to rest, that's all. Are you sure? Yes. Go. Say hi to the Pignon family for me. I'd like to invite them. They would be so happy after all this time. Right. That's a good idea. -Yes. -Good. I will be back soon. Right. You go. The Pignon are such dimwits. Cutie? Kitty? No... No, what did you do? Auntie Colette's plants... Hey, kitty! Cutie? I have to go! I'm closing the window! I will be back, don't worry! Shit... Fuck! What is it? I cut myself. Let me see. Shit! Here. Put pressure on it. You need stitches. No, I can't go. I will lose my job. But it will get infected. Whose kid is this? Mine, boss. What is he doing here? You think this is a nursery? Get him out of here. Guys! We are late! Get to work! Get moving! Right away, chief. I didn't do anything. I know, son. There is a movie theater over there. They have nice movies. Go there and keep warm. And buy something to eat. I'll join you when I'm done. I promise. Come with me. I can't, sweetie. I have to work. Dad needs to earn money. I've never been to the movies alone. You're a big boy now. We went many times. You know how it works. I don't want to, dad. I don't want you to stay alone in the streets. You understand? Wait. Inous, I'll be right back. Cover for me? No worries. OK, thanks. I'll accompany you, get back to work and wait for you in the lobby. OK. Come. What a jerk! I'm sure he threw everything away. I knew it. Guys, get out! Quick! What is it? Labor inspection. Hurry, go! For how long? I'll tell you. Get out of here! And our pay? Now is not the time, go! I was just asking. I will tell you. Now go or I won't hire you again. Leave your helmets here. Go, hurry! Go! And you, keep working! Go! They can't push us around, let's come back tomorrow. Yeah. They're bastards, but they always pay us. Right, we don't cost them much. Honestly, Mrs. Mariani, you are healthy. You have a young lady's heart. Your blood pressure is good. How much? 12/9. That's quite low. You have great humor. 12/9 is perfect. Doctor, I need medical examinations. Very thorough ones. And medicine that could raise the dead. What are you worried about? You are very healthy. No, I am not. I know I am not. I'm bored. The countryside depresses me. Tranquility gives me anxiety. I need noise, the smell of the street, I like traffic jams... I need all that, I need action. Even if it's a bit smelly. I need life, in a nutshell. That's what I want. Life. I see. -I'm cold, Dad. -You are cold? Wait, take my jacket. Here. You'll be a lot warmer now. Maybe I can use the barge tonight. Dad, don't leave me, please. I'm not leaving you. But dad must work, we need money. I want Mom. You know she's in heaven. I miss her. Me too. I talk to her, but she never answers me. I'm sure she can hear you. Then why doesn't she answer me? So you won't hurt. So we get used to her being gone. I can't do it, Dad. Yes, you can, sweetie. You are doing great. You are a big warrior. And Dad loves you. I love you too. My sweetie... Come. Juju, are you there? The kid... Your new boyfriend? I haven't seen him. He was there and he left. Maybe his parents work on a barge? I will be right back. OK. May I? Who are you? What are you doing here? He is my biggest fan. I play on the barge "La Parisienne." What's your name? Victor. One or two bumps? Dromedary or camel? I never know. Dromedary. You remember my name? Julie. What do you want? I'd like to help you. We don't need help. Is he your son? Yes, he is. Please, leave. Here. It's hot. He looks tired and cold, he can't go on like this. What do you know? Look at him. How about a bit of comfort, warmth, and a bathroom? Who do you think you are? Someone who also experienced hell. Thank you, but we are fine. Please, leave. A clean room for free and as long as you need one. One or two weeks, it doesn't matter. But come check it before you say no. Miss, I'm very tired and need to rest. It's very generous of you, but please, go. I can't believe it. You prefer to stay here rather than in a clean place? Do it for him. Didn't you hear me? Please, leave. Please. Do you remember where we were? I want to hear you say you refuse to sleep in a real room in the warmth, in a real bed, to wash in a real bathroom and eat a real meal at a real table. Say it now in front of your son and I will leave. I can't accept that. It will be harder after. After what? I have nothing left. Do you get it? Nothing. I had a normal life. I was an architect and had a wife. And everything changed. I lost it all. What happened? Mom is in heaven. Listen. I can put you up while you look for a better solution. Think about your son. It's cold here. And if you want to only sleep over for one night, it is fine. Your cardiologist? Yes. He is very worried. He wants me to do an MRI and a coronary catheterization. He wants to see me. Really? Well, if you trust him... Of course I do. He's the Clinic Director in Pompidou. If I have to be hospitalized one day... Listen... God forbid. Well, let's go home. No, you're staying here. You like your pretty flowers. Darling, you love them so much. For me? No, I refuse. No! You'd go alone? Yes. I've seen worse, you know it very well. Let me call an ambulance. That's too expensive. I'll take the train. Would you look at that. What do you mean? No, thanks. You are so stubborn, I swear. Sorry, there is no lift and it's on the 6th floor. The bathroom is at the end on the left, in the apartment. And I'll always leave the service door open. Thank you. Of course, you can also use the kitchen. OK, thank you. You'll have to come down every time. It's at the end of the corridor, on the left. I'll fill the fridge with nice things. You will see. I don't get it. Isn't this your home? No, it's my grandmas' house. They left for the countryside for a little while. I'm the plants' guardian. OK. This bag seems to be precious to you. It's just knickknacks, pencils and pastels. I draw sometimes. I get it. Now that I think of it, I bought a small prepaid phone. I'll give you my number just in case. We never know. I'll let you settle in. I'll get you fresh sheets and towels. Wait, I'll help you. I'll be right back. I can't believe it! No! I didn't even have time to fix anything and you did it again, kitty. Good thing I'll have time to fix this. I'm sorry. It's OK. Can I sit here? Of course. I haven't been in such a warm place in some time. What happened exactly? Want to tell me more about it? It's complicated. I... I lost my wife three years ago. She had a heart attack at work. The emergency services arrived too late. They couldn't do anything. We were stunned. She was still young, 34 years old. Dynamic, athletic and healthy. It was a shock. It was a free fall after that. I became a ghost. I lost my job and quickly couldn't pay the rent anymore, the loans, bills, all that... After a few months, Victor and I ended up homeless. Do you have a family? Friends? Depression scares a lot of people. As if it was contagious. And my family mostly tried to get me locked up in a psychiatric hospital to get Victor. But they can't do this. He is the only person that keeps me alive. I get that. Come on. I'll make us some coffee. I... Do you think I could... take a shower? Of course, I will give you towels. We'll have to find an outfit that is a bit more... Well, a bit less... I have a friend who kept clothes from her ex. You wear around the same size, it could fit. Why are you doing all this? I'm being civilized. And a fan like Victor must be pampered. Could you watch over him tomorrow for an hour or two? I have something important. OK. I just need to fetch a stage costume at the dry-cleaner's. Here. Thank you. Hi Kader. Hi. We are not hiring. What about them? They have a contract. The labor inspection is on us. Sorry, dude. No work off the books this week. I understand. But you still owe me money for four days of work. Don't piss me off. I got work to do. But I... I worked 10 hours a day for 4 days, it's a lot of money and I need it. I don't make the rules, dude. Find work elsewhere. Kader, I really need it... Drop it. Give me my money! Thanks. It's so good to be home. How wonderful. My plants! My plants... I'll be downstairs. See you later. What is this? What are you doing here? Aunt Colette. You're back. Indeed, and good thing I came back, apparently. Who's this Smurf? He is my cousin, Victor. We never agreed to this. Don't worry, it's temporary. More than you think. And what did you do to my plants? For them to end up like this... You did that on purpose, it's impossible. The cat did it. What cat? A cat. I hate cats and their hair. We didn't agree to this! Listen to me. The cat, the hair, the Smurf... Out! No, wait. I'll explain everything. -Out! -Wait! -I'll explain. -I don't want to hear it. You know what? Let's talk about it tomorrow. No. It's too late. I want to have a quiet night in my home. -This is still my home, no? -I am so sorry. You will choose new plants and I will pay for them. -They'll be even nicer. -No. Another cousin? Dad. I will explain everything. Get out. Victor, put your shoes on. We're going. They don't want us here. Let's go back home. No, don't go. Yes, we are leaving. It will never work. You saw her eyes. The hate in them. She'd kill me. You're a stranger. Exactly. It's the bonsai trees. She will calm down. Listen, it's very nice. You were adorable with us. But honestly, I don't care about her plants. No, listen. Stay here, OK? I'll fix it. Tell your father to stay here. I'll be right back. You know where they live? In a work site shack. It's as freezing and dark as death there. The child isn't even eight yet. He lost everything. They eat leftovers from restaurants. Have you seen my plants? I can't believe it. I'm talking about misery and suffering and you bring up your plants? We don't give a damn. Don't talk to me like that! What happened for you to become so selfish? Empathy, sharing... Do you know any of that? What do you care if they sleep in the maid's room? I'm sure you forgot it existed. I'm in my home, I invite whoever I want whenever I want. I'm the one deciding about that. Very well. What are you doing? I can't let them down. If you need help one day, don't count on me. I've needed help many times and many times, I was let down. Misery, suffering, violence... I've seen enough of that. Have you seen hundreds of dead people, old men, women, children, tortured, massacred, thrown in mass graves? Have you? I have. Only then can you see the future of humanity. We'll find a cheap hotel. No, never mind. You did enough for us. I'm really sorry. I didn't get along with her anyway. I just wanted to get the money they owe me. It's OK, I understand. When I get paid late, it also makes me very angry. Thank you again, Julie. You can drop us here. No, I will help you. It's the least I can do. You go in the warmth. OK, Dad. How did you end up here? When? A few weeks ago. I worked on the barge before they closed for the winter and I kept the keys. How did you end up with the bonsai trees auntie? Let's say it was a mistake. We really can't count on anyone. Hello? Colette? It's Maryvonne. Say, I can't find the code for the Wi-Fi. Where is it? Did you look in the big notebook in which you record the expenses? Well, your expenses. I'd rather not answer that. How is it going? Are you home safe? The trip exhausted me, I have no strength left. I wonder what the cardiologist will find. I am quite worried, you know. Good thing I went home. Want me to come home too? No. I feel quite weak, but you know me. I'm holding on. If I get hospitalized, I will tell you. OK, call me soon. You promise? Take care, Maryvonne. Have a nice evening. You can't stay here. This is a safe shelter. OK. You said you were an architect. Victor, put your pajamas on. I'll walk Julie back. OK, Dad. Back then, I printed plans from a computer and supervised work sites. It wasn't very glorious and didn't pay much, but I had a steady salary. Right. When my wife died, I went through hell. I was down in the dumps. I woke up crying every day. I lost all interest and stopped going to work. And when I went, I was a zombie. So of course, they fired me. Did you see a doctor? How about therapy? No, I didn't have the strength. When you are in such a bad psychological state, you lose the notion of time and everything else. The bills piled up, they cut off my phone line and the electricity and sent the court bailiffs. One day, you realize you've lost everything. You're homeless. I think that without Victor, I'd... Well... We will find a solution. I'll help you. You did way too much already, Julie. You're nice. I can stay, if you want. No, I don't think it's a good idea. Thank you. Agathe? Is it OK if I sleep over at your place tonight? Thank you. I'll be there soon. Come on, Victor. You'll continue tomorrow, OK? Let's sleep a bit. Why is Julie's auntie so mean? You know, sadly, some people are like that. Are you sure Mom can see us? Of course. Of course she can. Is she cold like us? No. It's warm where she is. It's nice. She isn't sick anymore? No. In heaven, no one is sick. No one suffers anymore. Are you sure, Dad? I'm certain of it. Time to sleep now. I can't stand Normandy It's the most boring area In the country Hey! What are you doing here? I was worried about you. What do you think? Julie isn't here? I sent her back home. What do you mean? We should never have trusted her. She brought a homeless guy here with his kid. And even worse, a cat. And it ate my bonsai trees! Look! A guy? What guy? A homeless guy she found in the streets or something. And she let them stay in that room, the maid's room. Did you kick them out in the middle of the night? -Your own grandniece? -Yes. This poor man lost everything and is out in the cold? You really are heartless. Look at that, your secular clear conscience is talking. Listen Maryvonne, this is my home. I don't need any lessons from anyone. OK? Well, this is also my home. And I have the right to put my granddaughter, this poor man and his kid up in the maid's room. How about that? Well, if you like flea-ridden people, that's your problem. But I don't want strangers, Smurfs, paupers or any granddaughters here. Got it? You know, you don't need to see a cardiologist but a psychiatrist. I know. Victor, you know what? Dad just got an idea. I'm sure you'll like it. Let's go and eat crepes together. What do you think? Victor? Victor? Victor? Do you need something? Are you lost? Can I help you? You look like Mom. You lost her? She's dead and doesn't suffer anymore. She isn't in pain anymore. You are right. But a mom never really is dead. She can see you and thinks about you all the time. She protects you. My dad said so. Your hair is like mom's. Victor. Well? Her hair looks like Mom's. Your son is adorable. Have a nice day. What are you doing? She said what you said about Mom. -Hi, darling. -Grandma. You say she isn't mean but she kicked them out. Listen, what matters the most today is that this man and his son agree to come back. But she won't. She must learn to share. Are you sure? Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Excuse me, waiter? Where did you go? Where normal people who love each other go. What now? Since when are you the only owner here? Maryvonne, I don't want to talk to anyone or see anyone. I want to be home alone. I can't focus. I met Julie and her proteges. What are you planning now, Lenin's fiancé? They're coming back. Will you set up watchtowers? Actually, that is a great idea. Grandma, it felt really nice to share this moment with you. It really was nice! Let me tell you. I will organize this dinner with everyone. I promise I can do it. It's not difficult. Just cut the vegetables into small pieces and use the right amount of cilantro. It's delicious. It is. I can't remember the last time I ate so well. Wait until you taste my salad. I will have some later. Thank you. Are you sure you don't want to eat? No! I'm not hungry! And you always add too much cilantro in your curry! May I leave the table? Yes, sweetie. I'll join you later. Thank you for the meal, Maryvonne. Colette. Come and have dinner with us. It's ridiculous. I don't eat with parasites and I'm not hungry. I made a chocolate mousse. I don't care. What a liar! She'd kill for chocolate. Maryvonne, don't even. You are a traitor. Yes? Josette? Yes? Tonight? A call from the sea! Our house's boiler broke. Too bad for you. For you too. The repairs and maintenance are also your legacy. At least, she knows how to make a chocolate mousse. Don't mind her, she is used to scaring people to get what she wants. Resist. She really isn't nice. Even with the kid. She is faking it, you will see. Life wasn't always nice to her. With you neither. It was less violent for me. Coco is the eldest. So she suffered more. What a suffering it must have been. Here is your taxi. Hello, sir. -Have a good trip. -Thanks, darling. I can't believe it! You ate all of the chocolate mousse that was left? What? I can't hear you. You ate it all! I can't hear what you're saying! Don't pretend to be deaf now! I'm sorry? I'm sorry you and your aunt fought. I really didn't want that. Don't worry, she loves to quarrel. It breaks her routine. Do you need money? No, thank you. It's nice of you, but I still have a bit left. What will you do now? Honestly, I don't know. I feel a bit lost. I don't know where to start. Enjoy being in the warmth for now. You have time. You are so nice, Julie. I'm also in the middle of a transition. I don't know how I'll bounce back or how long Colette will put up with me. You don't have anyone else? No, my family lives far away in a province and they don't understand why I don't have a stable job, why I'm not married and even less why I have no children. Right. Sorry if this is too private, but you have no man in your life? Not since three days ago. I am a free woman. What do you want to do today? Why is your auntie so mean? It's a game. She doesn't like us. It will get better, I promise. Julie? Sorry, but could you watch over Victor? I have to go out again. Of course, but I have a rehearsal later today. I won't be long. OK. Try to avoid getting hit this time. Right, no risk. Thanks. Is that me? Some of it. Orange juice? Yes? OK. Would you look at that! Mr. Abello? It's been some time. We haven't heard from you. Is your wife feeling better? She is so athletic, she could fight anything. And so young, so sturdy! I really envy you. He danced so well. Yes. I loved the juggler. It's true. Is the crepe good? Yes. Want another one? I don't know. I will see. She looks like Mom. Really? She's looking at you. Want to talk to her? Go ahead, I won't listen. Hello, Mom. How are you? Dad and I met a young woman called Julie. She is very nice. Dad and I like her. Do you? She likes you. Do you have children? Not yet. Do you want some? Yes, many. How many? This much! Come. Come on... I'm going to be late. Did you lose something? My score. I haven't seen it. I'm sure I left it here. My poor girl. You are such a scatterbrain. Julie is nice to us. Very. She looks beautiful when she plays. Yes, she is very beautiful. Come, let's warm up. I should get out more often at night. Paris is beautiful. Are you from a province? From the country of boredom. Same thing. You know, old age is like a country. There are small and big countries, beautiful and ugly ones too. You are right. If only I could move. What would you change? Nothing, actually. Thank you, sir. Let's go home. What's wrong? -What is it? -A nightmare. What happened to him? Nothing, just a nightmare. But he is fine. He fell asleep again. Is it recurrent? Yes, almost every night. What will you do now, except squatting in my kitchen? I will start by finding work again. What about the little darling? School starts again in ten days. That's very soon. I know. There you are. Yes? Hello. Already back? It was so cold in the countryside without a boiler. And I was worried about you. Colette's so stubborn. Hi, you. How handsome you are. Come, I bought an apple pie. Cool! Here is a napkin so you don't get dirty. All good, sweetie? Here. Thanks, Maryvonne. Say, do you really think you can find work? If I have to accept anything, I will. I'm not the only architect looking for work, sadly. Life is a battle. Everybody has weapons, and you do too. My sister and I have seen many people who lost it all. You have no idea. Sadness, regrets, all that... It's useless. The world is merciless to the weak. I think that's why religion and the idea of heaven were invented. So if you want to stay here, I have to know what happened to you. Julie doesn't mind, but I do. And my sister too, you know? Yes. Since when do you speak for me? Since when do you speak at all? It depends who I'm talking to. Honestly, look at that. Have you seen yourself? You think that looking like a hobo will make it easier to find work? Come on, François, tell us what happened to you. It's a long story. And I lost my job because of a lie and never could prove my innocence. Hello, sir. Who are you? François. Isn't he handsome? Even better. It's wonderful. Mr. Keller, I left your mail on your landing. -Thanks, Maria. -Have a nice day! You too. Weren't you in the country? I missed you too much. Why don't I believe you? You are used to liars. That's what my sister thinks. Does she think about me? So much. Lying at your age is shameful. Well, it's not our job. You easily trick people during property management company meetings. Keller, a former lawyer like you should be able to find information about someone. My sister told me what you did for her. See, she adores you. She's even convinced you can save us. She asked me to talk to you. What type of information? The type a lawyer could get. No, former lawyer. Don't play that card with me. Come on. What is it about? What is he doing? FRENCH PUBLIC BUILDINGS Good thing I kept a few contacts. You always were a chatterbox. That's all I can do. Where's your sister? She is thinking about the social divide. So? How is it? It's a heavy case. He isn't an altar boy for sure. DISCHARGE FROM PRISON Were you with François? No. What is it? Nothing. Is Colette already asleep? I don't know. She is watching her show. You're hiding something from me. You can't lie. He is a thief. He just got out of prison. I know. One of our lawyer friends found his record. What did he do exactly? Stealing, receiving stolen goods, misuse of corporate assets. No way... Yes. I understand better now. How could I be so stupid? I always have to be attracted to morons, liars, cheaters... I shouldn't have helped him. What about the kid? Let's talk to him. Let him explain himself. What good will that do? I swear it's not what you think. No? Then why did you go to jail? Why are you on trial for theft and fraud? Do you really think I am a crook? You lied to me, that's despicable. Do you tell people everything when you meet them? I was struggling. What were you doing in the work site's office? Did you follow me? Yes. You're spying on me? I'm trying to understand. So what's the truth? Everything I said is true. I got depressed and hit rock bottom. That's it. I couldn't work properly. We were late and they tried to fire me. But I had a medical certificate and supportive colleagues. So they made me a thief. They accused me of stealing goods. Without proof? Yes. The site manager was the one who stole the goods and sold them. He put the money in my locker. That's how they got me. I couldn't find anything in his office. So you can stay in your perfect world, I'm leaving. You shouldn't have let him go. Go find him. What are you doing? Certainly not. Go find him! INCOMING CALL Dad didn't wake me up. He had to leave early. When will he return? I don't know. He has a lot to do so it can take some time. What do we do? First, let's take a bath. OK? Come, sweetie. Say, this road is very winding. Don't you find it weird? No, it's not. It's like a road for a stuntman. There is one road on one side, and the other road on the other side. It's so cold outside, I'll never get used to it. Where's the kid? In Colette's room. -What did you tell him? -Nothing. And François? He won't answer. And the lawyer? He said the case depends mostly on the testimony of that guy, the site manager. -Do you have a name? -Sandoz. -Hello. -Hello. Is Mr. Sandoz here? He should be around. That's him, in the leather jacket. -Thanks. -You're welcome. -Mr. Sandoz? -Yes. Hello, I'd like to talk about François Abello. Don't bother me with him again! Leave me alone! Did you know he lost everything? That his wife died? It's not on me. He has nothing left, no house, no job... He lives with his 7-year-old son in a work site shack. He eats trash from restaurants. Is that normal to you? I told you it's not on me. It is. One word from you and he can have a normal life again. Do you have children? Two, but it's none of your business. How about spending the winter on the streets with them in a tent? In the wind and cold? It was 28 degrees last night. Listen, I can't help him. Your testimony can help. We both know it's bogus. A good way for the firm to get rid of him without paying. Who told you that? His lawyer. He's doing fine if he can afford a lawyer. He can't, but the association I represent can. And we have advantages lawyers don't have. We gathered testimonies on your work sites. And we've heard it was you and not Abello who stole goods to sell them. See, I have nice written testimonies here. It looks like you don't have many friends. Here is my phone number. How can you still live with yourself? -Hello. Say... -Yes? Have you seen François? Who? The man who lives here with his kid. No, I haven't. I'm sorry. Thank you. Still no news? No. Don't worry. He isn't the type of man to abandon his son. And yet, he did. Because he knows he is safe here with us. So you do like him. I am not a monster. Sometimes. Do you really think that? A bit, yes. I have fun with what I have. And you didn't walk after him, you ran. Go, bring our fugitive back. Bring him back. Yes? Yes, of course. Hello. Thanks for coming. I honestly didn't think it would go that far. I'm not a saint and there are things I'm not proud of, but I never thought they would sue Abello to avoid paying compensation. Even preventive detention causes damage. Especially if you're innocent. But I don't want to lose my job. He abandoned his son and has been missing for days. We must find a solution. Your job can wait, no? Here. The firm rigged the work site when it comes to clean-up. This is illegal. It's not in compliance with the building permit and the law. With this, you could make them drop the charges and more, if you want. But in any case, forget we ever met. OK? I already forgot. I don't even know your name. Thank you very much. What happened? I was so worried. I couldn't stand it. I needed some time alone. What about Victor? He is with Colette. She adores him. I wanted to apologize. I'm really sorry I doubted you, I... Isn't my grandniece amazing? Took you some time. She is wonderful. Don't forget I introduced you to her. You're incorrigible. She is phenomenal! Rebecca Payet-Hoareau Subtitling: Hiventy
