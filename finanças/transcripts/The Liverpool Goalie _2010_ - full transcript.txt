I got these from my dad when I was six. He said that he who has strong hands would not have to worry about anything. The following year, he slipped in the bathtub. Now he's dead. So it's healthy to worry. Everyday life is full of death traps. Like noise-cancelling headphones. - Have some glue, Jo. - Come on, try it! Widening your circle of friends. Running on stairs. Taking a shortcut across the construction site. ...and football. Especially football. It's not exactly the safest sport to play. Jo! Jo! Jo! Get out there! Get out there! Kids actually die on youth football fields every year. -But no one worries about it. - Ok, Boye. You're in. Come on guys! Five minutes left, we can do this. So it's healthy to worry. The Liverpool Goalie Jo! Jo! - What is it? - Per ?ystein has it. - What? - What do you think? Don't run on the stairs, Jo. You can break your neck. - Going out? - Yeah, to Per ?ystein's. Is it the football cards again? You know... I think you should be careful with the football cards. - Why? - Because you can become addicted. Do you remember the dentist's ex-wife? She was so great? She goes to the store and plays games on the exchange every day. Living in a small apartment. No money for food even. - Healthy as a fish. - As always. Remember your helmet! Einar! Hi, Jo. - Per ?ystein has the goalie. - Seriously? Yeah, come on, let's go. Hi, Jo. Long time no see. - Hi, Anders. Uh... are you home? - Only for a few days. - So you're still into football cards? - Yeah, we should stop, but... - Just need them all first. - I see. - How's it going in England...? - It's cool. This is just the beginning. It's the shit. Anders will be the first here to end up on football cards, that's for sure. - Tell us about it... - Uh, Jo? I thought you were going to Per ?ystein's? I have to see if it's true. - Go on then. - Yeah. What about you, Jo? We need people on the team. Training on Tuesday. Are you in? Some have it all. Like Anders. He'll be a pro in England. While I... will struggle on the bench from day one. Tom Erik... good. You don't count, you haven't played. Good. Then comes a heavy depression. I'll become a pill addict. It's a short road to worse things. Pocket money isn't enough. Put down the TV! Put down the TV! Put your hands over your head! Now! I'll have to go on a long vacation at the state's expense, with free food and lodging. Jo? Aren't you going to pick up your soap? - Jo? - Jo? Tuesdays don't really work for me, actually. It'd be good for you. - You think too much. - Come on, Jo. - Bye, Anders. - Bye! Are we done collecting, then? That's it? Yeah, it seems that way. Typical Per ?ystein. He doesn't even like football. What do you mean? You can't like football if you don't play? - Yeah, you can. - You can. - That's what I said. - You were being ironic. Yes, the search is over. - I was in the city with my mom yesterday... - Let's see it! The Liverpool goalie. - I'll give you a thousand bucks for it. - Sorry, it's not for sale. Pass it around then. Come on, let's see it. Gimme the card! That's what I thought. It's not real. It's like a Photoshop thing. What do you mean? Ow! Mom!! Ow! Mom!! Ow! Shit, it hurts! What's going on here? You fucking shits get out of here! Jo. Are you done? Yeah, with the math homework. But not the essay. Okay. So what do you want me to write about? Whatever. Okay. About feelings or... - What you did on the holidays? - Took a vacation. What did you do? Went to the cabin. By the sea or the mountains? My God, Jo! Can't you just make something up? - And the essay? - Yeah, it's coming. Tom Erik? I was just wondering... if you could maybe start doing your homework yourself... - If that's okay with you? - You refusing? The punishment is... Noogies... Every day! I'll be bald, at the age of fourteen. We'll have to move to a place where they always wear hats. And the bottle is my mom's best friend. Mom? Couldn't you have just done Tom Erik's homework, huh? No, no! It's nice... to help. Good. That's what friends do, you know. - They help each other. - Yeah, friends... You can sit there, Mari. All right! We have a new student in class today. Mari. - Say hi to Mari. - Hi, Mari. - Yes, Nina. - Are you good at playing football? - I don't know, maybe. -Cool! You have to play on our team. - Cool! - Super cool... Tom Erik! Welcome, Mari. Get out your math books. We'll start with something called equations today. Is there anyone here who knows what an equation is? Anyone other than Jo? Yes... Mari. What is an equation? An equation is a mathematical expression with one or more unknowns. That's exactly right, Mari... And how do we solve an equation? The point of an equation is to find the unknown, and there may be several unknowns... You put an equal sign in the middle... And then the amount on the left side will always be the same as on the right side. Then you can simplify... the numbers on each side. - So they're the same. - Yes. Good, Mari! Very, very good. Hi, Jo! - Hi, Steinar. - Home already? - Uh, yeah. - I'm meeting with your mother, you know. - Oh, is it the accounts again? - Yeah... yeah, the financial statements... Yeah, it's great that she has time to help me. I'm not so good with numbers. - You don't think it's too much work for her? - No, it's fine. Yes... right. But yes... maybe it would be nice... with some time off? Sure. Hi. Hi. - There you are. - Yep! What are you talking about? - Eh... I don't know. - No? - Maybe work a little? - Yeah. - See you later. - Right. - Bye! - Bye. - You're still up? - Yeah. Had homework again. I've just got to have some food. I get so hungry when I work late. - It went good with the accounts then? - Hm? Yeah, it went well. Yeah... - Something wrong? - Nah... it's just... Steinar seems nice. What's that supposed to mean? Isn't that Tom Erik's book? Oh, shit... I took the wrong one again. I'm not having an affair with your neighbor, if that's what you think. It's fine. What would I do with a man anyway? Mom, Mom... No, no! I've outgrown this. All girls who play football are lesbians? I'm not saying that all girls who play football are lesbians. Just that there's a greater chance of you being one. Explain that. - Like... you wear shorts, don't you? - Yeah. Boys shorts... And get huge legs and stuff. You agree with this? It's girls football. It's not pretty, Nina. What do you think, Jo? About girls football? It's all right. That's because he's gay. Am not. You are, you just don't know it yet. "What I did during the summer holidays" "Math Camp Sandefjord 2008" "About feelings" Any more about your brother getting a contract? - He's going pro, right? - Yeah, but... I don't know as much as I... It's so confidential over there. - By the way, is it true that he met Solkj?r? - Yeah, I think so. My God! - Hi. - Hi. - So, you're Mari? - Mhm. My name's Jo. We're in class together. Yeah, I know. I've seen you staring at me in class. But it's okay. I like you too. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Jo. - Okay. - It's just, I've noticed that... - you've been staring at me in class. - Yeah... I can't handle rejection. - Life has no meaning anymore. - Hello? - Jo? Jo? Jo! - I need help before it's too late. Jo! Jo! It's good to live in the welfare state of Norway. After many years, I'm let out. I'm filled with jealousy and hatred. The Norwegian health care system... has made yet another mistake. Hey, gay boy! What did I say! - Why did he call you gay boy? - Try to guess. - Are you gay? - Yeah. And on weekends I wear women's clothes and sing old Grand Prix tracks! - Everything okay, Jo? - Yeah. All right, I have your essays. Many good, absolutely. A little short. Good. Very good, Tom Erik. Maybe you'll read us some? - Sure. - Great! Notice the language, simple and easy phrases throughout. Very well written! Tom Erik? About... About feelings. The most intense and unexplainable... and inexplicable of all emotions, is to be in love. Shhhh! Let Tom Erik read. It's beautiful. There is a feeling that violates all laws of nature, and can never be explained scientifically. Now... Now comes the best part! Just keep reading, Tom Erik. All your senses are intensified when your loved one is nearby. Her touch is electric. Her eyes are more intense. She smells better than other girls. You should have written what I did on the holidays! Not that feminine stuff! But you got a good grade, didn't you? Hey! Should I... Hey, Tom Erik? Hello? What if the card doesn't exist? If there's a manufacturing defect, or something? - We must have bought thousands of packs. - Don't be so negative. - One of us has got to get it soon. - Yeah, when we're sixty. Did you get it? I'm thirteen, and addicted to football cards. I should be addicted to... completely different things. Do you have a calculator? Use the PC. Jo? The background came with it. I was surprised, too. Like, what are the chances of that? I don't know. Please stop! Better make your move soon! She won't be available for long with that ass. - Nina! - Hi! What are you doing here? Just thinking about that conversation yesterday, about girls football. - Thought I'd follow up. - Okay. I've noticed it's become popular and stuff lately. For girls, that is. Yeah, for the last twenty to thirty years. But... She only just started. Mari, or whatever she's called? - She's okay, right? - Uh, yeah? - What are you trying to say, Jo? - Just asking a simple question. Come on, I see it in your face. You're in love, aren't you? Relax, I won't tell anyone. - Has she said anything? - About what? - About me? - Yes, actually. She did? She said that she would love to have a gay friend. One she could go shopping with. - Gay friend... - Nah, I'm just kidding you! - I'll talk to her after practice, okay? - Sure. But just... be subtle about it and stuff. Say I'm good in math or something. Or that I'm straightforward or... Whatever, just something nice. - First of all, count on Nina. - And second? Hey, Jo! Hi. Do you have a few seconds? As you know... Your mother's been helping me with my accounts. And you and your mother, you've got your own accounts... The thing is, I was wondering if there's a way we could merge our accounts. But your mother doesn't want to very much. It's like that with accounts, that one should avoid double accounting. - Is there a question here somewhere? - Yes. I was wondering if there was any problem for you... if we all settled together into a company? - You're a psychologist, right? - Yes. It's fine with me if you want to be my mom's boyfriend. - You mean it? - Yeah. Even if you're not completely suited to your job. Right... - Oh, you'll have to ask her. - Yeah, yeah! Hey, it's Nina... No, it's just my machine! Please leave a message. Hi. This is Jo, calling again. If you could call me as soon as possible, that'd be great. I'll be up late. Bye. Don't talk so much on the phone, Jo. You can get mobile cancer. There's no such thing as mobile cancer, Mom. You know what I mean, right? - Sleep well then! - Good night. Nina. - Why haven't you called me? - The battery was dead. Did she... say anything? Yeah, she doesn't want to go out with you. You asked her that? Uh, yeah? - Did she say anything else? - Yeah. If someone wants to go out with her they have to ask her themselves. Hi, Jo! Tell the teacher I was sick. I have to go before she gets here. It's a little late. - Hi. - Hi. Yeah, what happened yesterday... It's like... Nina might have misunderstood. What I said, she kind of... took it the wrong way. I asked her to find out... or... talk to you about math. Yeah, just to say that you were good in math. So yes... That's all I wanted to say. How many unknowns can you do? Three. Almost four. I can do four. Really? Yeah, not that I've tried very hard. I can only sort of. Yeah, it's kind of the same with me. I know that X should be 3, but I can't get any further. - How far can you get? - The first is 6x minus 3x, parentheses 5 minus x equals 10, minus parentheses x plus 7, parentheses 2x minus five. So, minus the front parentheses is the same as minus one. Which simply means to reverse any sign in the parenthesis. So 5x in the first is equal to 45. - And then the x in the second equals nine. - And x equals... three! So, creating genius food? Are you making IQ pudding? - Do you think that's funny? - No, not really. - So why are you laughing? - Just to stay out of trouble. It should be pretty good. - Who the fuck was that? - It was me. - She's just kidding. - IQ-pudding? Is that the best you can do? - Be glad you're a girl. - Otherwise I'd be a bully? - Or stupid, perhaps? - How's it going here? - IQ pudding, really! - I know! - Like, did you see his face? - I know! What surprises me is people find him funny! That they let him carry on. Yeah, I know. I've even heard that he's gotten people to do his homework for him. Quite pathetic. But I can understand it a little. If he threatens them, I mean. I'd rather have a black eye and keep my self-respect. - Tom Erik? - ...thirty-one, thirty-two... I don't think I can do your homework any more. ...forty-two, forty-three, forty-four... You realize that it takes a lot of time and... maybe it'd be smart for you to do a little homework yourself. Nothing personal or anything. - ...sixty-seven, sixty-eight... - Shall we leave it at that, then? Yeah, good to have that out of the way. Hi! What's up? I was just wondering... I'm going into town tomorrow to buy math software. - So I wondered if you'd like to go? - Yeah, I really would! Yeah? But don't you have a game tomorrow? - Game? - Yeah, don't you play football? No, I don't dare. Hey there! Jo doesn't dare to play football! Pussy, pussy, pussy... Yeah, yeah, I play football! - But not right now, since I'm injured. -Oh, that sucks. What happened? I twisted my knee and... - so it goes... torn cartilage. - Ow. - You're a goalie? -Yeah, goalie. - So... do they have to operate? - Yeah, I'm waiting in line... - That sucks. - Yeah, it sucks. So there'll be no game for me tomorrow, obviously. Mari! Well, after school tomorrow then. And therefore x equals? X equals 5. All right, I think we're done. But hand in your math homework before you go. - I think I forgot it at home. - You forgot it at home? - Drop it at my office later. - Yeah, will do. - Bye for now. - Yeah, bye for now. - Hold on. - But... I... Hold on, I said! Okay, just a second. Why don't you go on ahead? I have to have a little talk with Tom Erik. Is something wrong? Nah, he has some problems at home, you know... so... - Yeah... that's nice of you. - We'll meet at the bus stop then? - Mhm. - Great. - What happens now? - Homework. - But we're done with that. -Hm? I told you yesterday, behind the school. No... I don't remember. You have to start doing your own homework, right? Because, think about your professional development. How long do you think it'll take me to catch up? You'll have to find out for yourself, I gotta go. Fair enough. If you're the type who breaks agreements. But know one thing: You're fair game. KILLED BY NOOGIES BOY FOUND WITHOUT HEAD! Fine. Sorry for what happened with Tom Erik. It took some extra time. - Stand there. - Hm? - Just stand there. - Why? Just do it, okay? What happens now? Not afraid of the ball, are you goalie? Mari? Good luck with the surgery. Are you spreading rumors that I'm not playing football? Rumors? But you don't. No, no, but... How could I know that you bragged about a football career? - I didn't do that. - Yeah, what then? I got a little carried away. Or... eager perhaps. My God... My God, I give up. What's up with the government? Do they want to produce losers? They should shut down junior high. It's completely unnatural gathering people at that age. Everyone is totally different! Just look in the shower. Some are hung like porn stars, while others... No, I'll just suffer my way through this nonsense. You think it'll be so much better afterwards? Can it be worse than this? Something wrong? - It's time for dinner. - Can I eat with you? It's a bad time... today. Is your brother still at home? No, he forgot them the last time he was here. - Bye. - Okay, bye. See you tomorrow. Unfortunate. Drug addicts... Who's that? - This late? - Probably Einar. - Hi! - Hi. Come in. - Is Else home? - Yeah, in the kitchen. - It's Einar. - Hi. - Hi... - Hi... Hi. You see, there's a new guy who started at work... We celebrated with cake, and there... was some left over. So, here I am! - This is nice! - Thanks. You could have called first... - You know if this is a bad time... - I'd certainly like cake. I'll put the coffee on. Then maybe afterwards we can work a bit, as long as you're here, I mean. I thought we could just enjoy ourselves a little. Yeah, sort of like a private meeting... Hey! Look at that, football cards. - Can I see? - Sure. So that's what you're into? Yeah, for most of last year. We're trying to collect them all. I think he should stop with that stuff, but he's an addict. Can you get addicted to stuff like that? Well, without breaking any confidentiality, I have yet to treat anyone for football card gambling. Liverpool? They were quite the team when I was a kid. - Do you need any help, Mom? - No, no, no, I'm fine. Oh, look at this. The Liverpool goalie. He's good, consistent at least. Liverpool has had some legendary goalkeepers... Ray Clements... Bruce Grobbelaar, David James... Remember? No, not really. There, just need... Ow! It's fine, I just need to get a knife. I think maybe we should save the cake for another day. I'll just... show you out. - Okay? - Yes. - Bye! - Yeah, bye. - What do you want? - I have the Liverpool goalie. - Yeah, right. We've heard that before. - Yeah, we've heard that before. - I have it at home. - You're lying. No. Great, if you have the card then let me buy it from you. - It's not for sale. - A thousand bucks! If you do your own homework from now on, you'll get it for free. If you have that card, I'll do your homework. - No thanks. - All right. - Meet me at my house then, after school. - Yeah, great. - Deal? - Deal. - Is it true? - Yeah, just go wait with the others. It better be here, dickhead! There's no juice and rolls. Should we wait for them? Nooo! Okay. Ever since the series began, it has mostly been about one thing. Getting the Liverpool goalie. - There have been times of disappointment... - Can we see the card or what? Okay. Who took it? I had it. It was in that room! Tom Erik! Give me the card back. - I didn't take any damn card. - He should get a noogie, too. Let's go. - He should be punished! - As punishment you will... Talk like a girl at school. Fine. You'll talk like a girl tomorrow. Will I get my card, Tom Erik? I didn't hear you? Okay, fine. Like a girl. You heard what he said. - Fine, like a cuckoo. - Takes one to know one. Fine. Not bad. Idiot. - Why did I get a noogie and he...? - Shut up. Bye, gotta go. See you. Democracy or dictatorship. Does anyone know the difference? No one knows the difference? Jo? What is the difference between democracy and dictatorship? The difference between democracy and dictatorship? In a democracy, the population decides who they elect. While in a dictatorship... the dictator decides. What are you doing, Jo? I thought I answered your question. - Yes, but that's not what I meant. - What did you mean? What are you doing, Jo? - I don't know. - You don't? You're fooling around in class. All that nonsense you're doing. If there's something wrong, you come to me and we'll talk about it, ok? If I tell the truth, Tom Erik will be expelled. Hi, did you watch "Newton" last night? They found a dinosaur skeleton. No one likes a tattler. No one. SNITCH We'll enroll in the State's witness program and go into hiding, far out in rural Norway. But one man hasn't forgotten. Tom Erik's father. Caravan King and passive member of the hunting and fishing team. You fuckin' rat. It's really nothing. In class, it was just for laughs. For laughs? - Hi! - Hi! Did you see who took the card yesterday? No, where was it? Under the PC. - Could have been anyone who took it. - Try and think. I'm a little busy now, so... we'll pick this up tomorrow. Bye. - You know what my mom said? - No, what did she say? - No sleeves, no chocolate. - Jo? What? Jo, I have to talk to you. Talk away, I'm listening. After school. It's about Einar. Oh, about Einar... What a surprise. What do you mean? You're going to say that you're together. - What makes you think that? - It's just that... it's a small world and there's whispering, stuff like that. Rumors and hearsay. It's just what I've heard. What are you doing, Jo? Have I done something? The teacher called. He said he's worried about you. He said that you say you dress in women's clothes on the weekends. - I was just kidding, Mom. - And you talk with a girls voice in the classroom? - It's just a joke we have. - What happened to your hair? - Nothing! - If something's wrong, you can tell me. It's nothing! Any new friends who are tempting you? Is it the new girl in class? You know you should be very careful, Jo. I just read about a thirteen year old girl who had twins. - Imagine, twins at thirteen, it's not funny. - I have homework to do. - She's pregnant... She's pregnant! - That's impossible. Jo, I didn't mean it like that. Don't run on the stairs, you can slip! If you just tell us parents, we can solve it together. And the nurse, but... You... You won't do something stupid? Jo? "Blood in the grass" Hi. You guys have to help me if you saw Tom Erik take the Liverpool goalie. Don't you get it? The card is gone, Jo. Can't you get that through your head? - What's it to you? - Just forget about it, okay! And you and Mari? Are you together now? - It's not like that. - How is it, then? - Where are you going? - To Tom Erik's. He's not gonna let you in. - What are you doing? - Trying to stop you. Jo? Hurry up. Well, can we go now? Jo! Someone's coming. Come on, let's go. - I know he has it! - He doesn't, it wasn't him who took it! It was me. Cathrine? Tom Erik? Cathrine? Cathrine, get out of here! Hello? I know you're there. Open the door! Come out and we'll talk, there's no danger. I won't do anything. TEEN WAS FISH FOOD DISMEMBERED AND DUMPED IN THE RIVER! Come out, I said! Open up! I know you're there, open up! Come out! Come out, I said! ...we have to go... ...come on... Come out. You killed a dog... ...for a football card! I thought it was him who took it. But now I know it was Einar. Oh. So, then... Are you planning to break in there, too? He admitted it. You know... To me... it seems as if you're the only one who has seen this card. Can't we just go over to Einar's and sort this out? Know what? You'll do no such thing. You'll come home after school every day. - Hi. - I tried to get hold of you. I don't have time now. Stop what you're doing, Else. We have to talk. Can you go inside, Jo? - When I say I don't have time, I don't have time! - I've been offered a new job in Troms?. That's great. Congratulations. Good luck. Just some fuss about the accounts. There. Now we can eat and relax a little. Can you go down to the basement and get the hamburgers? The ones we bought in Sweden? Mom? I've already lost one, I have no plans to lose another! Do you understand? So you can just go down to the basement and get the damn hamburgers! I have to have that card. - You'll get it tomorrow. - Seriously, I have to have it now. - Tom Erik could kill me at any time. - Jo! You have to go. - Please! - I'll go when I get the card. - What are you doing here? - Hi. You shouldn't be here. Go home, Jo. Come here. Come on. - I think... - You've done your job, now go home. - But we had an agreement that we... - Go home! Bye Anders, we'll talk. - What's going on? - I think it best that you talk to Einar. - What did he want with Anders? - Not a damn word to anyone about this, okay? Okay? He couldn't take the pressure, Jo. He ran away from training camp after a week. - Ran away? - Mhm... His parents had to go get him. He's been hospitalized until now. But the contracts and everything... Is it just a lie? His father tries to keep it a secret... But... They ought to admit it. So, now you know. How did you learn all this? Einar told me. So that's why you were in his room? Why did you think? I don't know. - Sorry I poured pancake batter on you. - That's okay. It was no good anyway. Too much salt. I'm just so tired of people acting stupid and lying and stuff. I do Tom Erik's homework. - Why? - Because it's... great fun. You can't keep doing it, Jo. Hey, you'll get the card, you'll get it! Here's the Liverpool goalie. We had a deal, right? No! What are you doing? They have new cards. There's a Liverpool goalie in every pack. You were in my room, damn it! - My dad found the mags and the cigarettes. - And the condoms. That cost me a year's allowance! Hold him. - How about a noogie to get the blood flowing? - Please, I'll do anything! I'll give you money. I'll do your homework. I'll be your personal assistant. Did you hear that? We can get him to do anything. - Like a slave? - A slave would be cool. - I prefer personal assistant. - Shut up! He can buy food for us at lunch. And beer and stuff. Congratulations on your new job. He who has strong hands, doesn't need to worry about anything. That's what my dad said. I wonder if he knew what he was talking about. The battery's dead again. Did you know that Anders had been placed under psychiatric care? - Boye's mother told me. - It's a secret, Mom. That's what I'm talking about, Jo. This football... It's just a lot of injuries and accidents. - Sit still, Jo! Sit still! - Steinar's right! You talk about how dangerous everything is! You take my temperature every single day, I'm never sick! - I've been a wimp! - Have you and Steinar been talking? - Mom... - Did he invite in? No, he didn't. No one will fucking teach me how to raise my son. Need to sharpen up, Jo. I said I wanted a Pepsi. You'd better bring another one after school, okay? You want anything? - Yeah. - Yeah, I'll have a soda. Jo's buying. - He's our slave. - Make it two more, Jo. - Monster... Anders... - Cut it out. You are so fucking childish. If you keep it up, we'll tell the principal. We? - Yeah, me and Jo. - Is that right, Jo? Have you thought about the gossip? No, I don't think Einar would want the gossip. You're a coward, Jo. Well done, Jo. You're improving. ...and that's what we call fertilization. That's it. Chapters four and five tomorrow. Jo, would you erase the blackboard? Yeah. Mari? Hey, Einar. How's it going with your brother? Has he talked any more with Solskjaer? He's good. Insanely good. Yeah, really insane. Relax. He can join the Special Olympics instead. - Cut it out, you're incredibly boring. - Yeah, I know. We're insanely boring. Give it a rest! - Behind the stands after school. - You wouldn't dare. Pfff, try me. Take my hand then. Fine. Let go. Let go damn it! You're breaking my hand. Say that you'll never bother anyone again. Get him off me. - Say it! - I will never... bother anyone... again... - With a girls voice! - What? Girls voice! I will never bother anyone again. Scram! Jo! Wait up! I should have done that long ago. Check this out! They have new cards. There's a Liverpool goalie in every pack! I'm not joking this time! Sorry I took the card. I was going to give the entire collection to Anders. I wanted to make him happy. I get that. My mom grilled all my cards. - She's crazy! - Oh? I hadn't noticed. Mom? You can protest as much as you want. I'm going down to the field to see that it's safe. - Mom, it's football, not base jumping. - Don't even talk about that. Look... It's like this: Steinar's going to live here a while. - If it's okay with you. - He'll sleep on the couch. Mhm. - There's something wrong, you know. - Yeah, I see that. I see that. - No, I've been in the shop like this? - And at work... Several times. It's not true. My God! He's a psychologist. You'll save some money. Jerk. Jerk...

He has strong hands. - Yeah, that's good. You can be... backup goalie. Put these on. We start in 10 minutes. This is war! Out to warm up, come on! The guys we're playing today are really good. So I expect a little more effort than last time. Are you ready for the match? Thought I'd see how it's going. It's good. Good, Anders. Right, continue warming up. Don't want any injuries, stretch properly. - Hi. - Hi. I heard about what happened in class. It was good to get it over with. - So you're the goalie, then? - Yeah, backup. With a little luck, I'll live through the season. Without having to play. Shit! Where's the fun in football? Why do they need to play such games? Boye! First post! Hey, ref! Are you blind, or what? - You okay? - No... Sit down and rest. Hey, Jo! You're in. - But I have a stomachache and... - Nonsense... Jo, just hold them for two minutes and we win by a point. You can do this, come on. People die on the football field. Every year. So what am I doing here anyway? Goal! It got 5 million hits on the web. There were many offers. But for me, there was just one team. Jo! Get out there! Jo, get out there! Get out there, Jo!
