Subtitle By: Chromeman & Improved By: Fidel33 Sub Upload Date: July 16, 2018 (TOWER BELL TOLLING) (WHISTLES) (ALARM CLOCK RINGING) (WHIMPERS) (BARKS) (GASPS) (BARKING) NEWS REPORTER: We're all familiar with the illegal poaching of endangered animals in the wild. But never before has an animal in captivity been slaughtered for its pelt. Animal protection groups that monitor the international trade in game contraband have further told us that a white Siberian tiger is so rare that the offer of a pelt will surely draw the attention of law enforcement agencies. Shortly before dawn this morning, security staff at London Zoo discovered the excoriated carcass of its prized three-year-old female Siberian tiger, Su-Ling. (GROWLS) Police sources have suggested that the killing was contracted by a private collector. Oh, isn't that horrible? Who'd do a thing like that? ...moved into the urban zoological park. We must ask ourselves if any animal in the world is safe. This is Tim Ryan reporting from London Zoo. (GROWLS) What a bad day for the animal kingdom. Oh. One day, very soon, Pongo, I'm going to make a sale. 'Cause we're fast approaching the point where I'm going to have to start eating your table scraps. (WHIMPERS) Oh, I was exaggerating. Well, shall we? (SIGHS) It's not that bad, it's just very important this meeting goes well. You know how I am about meetings, I tend to get a little... Well, nervous. When I get nervous, I say things, I do things I shouldn't say, I shouldn't do and next thing we know... It's freelancing. Probably. (PONGO BARKS) He's got the best instincts in the industry. Since he was six, he's picked the top-selling game every year. (YELLS) (EXHALES DEEPLY) Well? What do you think? Potentially good graphics, reasonably entertaining premise, the dog's well-conceived and the environments are engaging. But I'm not interested in a game that has a chubby little dog catcher as the bad guy. Even girls won't like this game. Sorry, mate. Yeah, but wait, wait, wait. Herbert, wait! What if there were a better villain, you know, someone you could really hate? It's not hatred that's important. It's the desire to annihilate. (DOOR CLOSES) Top of the morning to you, ma'am. Morning. Good morning. Miss De Vil's office. Could you hold, please? Yes, I'll be with you in a moment. Could you hold, please? (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Thank you. Good morning. Miss De Vil's office. Could you... Good morning, Miss De Vil. (PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY ) WOMAN #1: Good morning, Miss De Vil. WOMAN #2: Good morning, ma'am. Good morning. (GASPS) Anita, darling. Oh, good morning, Cruella. What a charming dog. Thank you. Spots. Yes, she's a Dalmatian. CRUELLA: Inspiration? ANITA: Yes. Long hair or short? Short. CRUELLA: Coarse or fine? ANITA: I'm afraid it is a little coarse. Pity! But it was very fine when she was a puppy. Redemption. We need to have a little girl talk. Come to my office. Bring the drawing. Now, darling. Tell me more about these spots. I did leopard spots in the '80s. Well, Dalmatian spots are a little different, aren't they? Cozy. Cuddly. Classic. Less trashy. Exactly. Do you like spots, Frederick? Oh, I don't believe so, madam. I thought we liked stripes this year. What kind of sycophant are you? Um... What kind of sycophant would you like me to be? Frederick. I'm beginning to see spots. What would it cost us to start again on next year's line? FREDERICK: Millions. Can we afford it? Well, yes... Thank you, darling. Now go away. I have to talk to Anita. CRUELLA: Alonzo. Did you ask Anita if she'd like something to drink? Oh, I'm fine. Thank you. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Sit down, please. How long have you been working for me? Uh, two years, last August. And you've done wonderful work in that time. (CHUCKLES) Thank you. I don't see you socially, do I? No. And you're not very well-known, despite your obvious talent. Well. Notoriety doesn't mean very much to me. Your work is fresh and clean. Unfettered, unpretentious... It sells. And one of these days, my competitors are going to suss out who you are. And they are going to try to steal you away. Oh, no. If I left, it wouldn't be for another job. Oh, really? What would it be for? Well, I don't know, um... If I met someone... If working here didn't fit in with our plans. Marriage. Perhaps. More good women have been lost to marriage than to war, famine, disease and disaster. You have talent, darling. Don't squander it. (CHUCKLES) Well, I don't think that it's something we have to worry about. I don't have any prospects. Thank God. Well, I should be getting back to work. Yes. Please do. Alonzo. The drawing. Take the drawing from Anita and hand it to me! Is that difficult? Thank you. Now go stand somewhere until I need you. I look wonderful in spots. However, I would like to make one small change. Yes. We could do this in linen. It would be stunning in fur. But you'll be wearing it to the Chesterton Trials. That's in April. Uh, fur would be inappropriate. But it's my only true love, darling. I live for fur. I worship fur. After all, is there a woman in all this wretched world who doesn't? Give it to Anita. Oh. (CRUELLA CHUCKLES) It is rather amusing, isn't it? (CHUCKLES) What is? Well, if we make this coat, it would be as if I were wearing your dog. (CHUCKLES WICKEDLY) Woof! Woof! (LAUGHS MANIACALLY) (PONGO BARKS) (SIGHS) Sorry, Pongo, I didn't mean to take so long. If I could just sell a game, we might be able to get a car. (PONGO BARKS) Come on. (BARKS) Pongo! Pongo! (BRAKES SQUEALING) Whoa! Pongo! Slow down! (GIRLS SCREAMS) Slow down! (MAN #1 YELLS) MAN #2: Watch it! Watch it! (BRAKES SQUEALING) Oh. Pongo! Hey! (YELLS) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Pongo! Pongo! Pongo! (HORNS BLARING) (GRUNTS) (TYRES SCREECH) (YELLS) Ooh! Pongo! (HORN BLARES) Turn! No! Pongo! (YELLS) (ALL YELLING) MAN: Watch it! (YELLS) Stop! Stop! Oh! (HORNS BLARING) (CAR CRASHES) (GLASS SHATTERING) Pongo! (LEASH SNAPS) Pongo! (YELLS) (SCREAMING) I don't think he wanted to do that. Here we go, Perdy. (BARKING) Oh, now stop it. Okay, go! Go fetch it. (CHUCKLES) Good girl. Come on. Bring it back. Come here. Come here. Yeah. (CHUCKLES) Good girl. Okay. Oh. Now, come on. Let's go again. Pongo! Pongo! Go on. (GRUNTS) (BARKS) Hello. Who are you? (GRUNTS) (GROANS) Oh, I got ya! Very smart. Very funny. Everybody had a good laugh. Let go of that dog! Stay out of it, lady. Stop it, or, or... I'll hit you. Today is not a good day to threaten me, ma'am. I don't care if it's a good day or a bad day, I'll hit you, nonetheless. Whatever. Okay, I gave you a good, proper warning. Look, I've had... (GROANS) Oh. Now, release my dog or I'll hit you again. Oh. (SCOFFS) Your dog? Yes. That is my dog. Will you let her go? (WHIMPERS) Excuse me. (WHINES) He's a she. Mm-hmm. Hello, Pongo. I beg your pardon, ma'am. I'm sorry. My mistake. What have you got in the purse of yours? Rocks? Oh, no. Bricks. I've been paving my garden and every time I see a discarded brick, I just pick it up. Yeah? How many did you find today? Uh, three. Three? Oh, well. That's what I would have guessed. Mmm. Why are you all wet? I went swimming in the pond. Oh, you shouldn't have. The water's filthy. Mm-hmm. Yes and it tastes like fish. And, um, you've lost a shoe, did you know that? Yes, I do. As a matter of fact, I did. I noticed it running down the gravel path. Oh, I'm ever so sorry. I mean... You know, I thought if you were silly enough to go swimming in a dirty pond you'd be silly enough not to realize you'd lost a shoe. Actually, I crashed my bicycle in the pond. The only part of my body that wasn't injured was my head. But now, thanks to you. I got the complete set of bodily injuries. (BOTH LAUGH) Well, it was nice being assaulted by you, Miss... Oh, my name is Anita. Anita? And yours is Roger. Um, I read it on your dog's identification tag. Oh. Oh! Yes. Well... Nice meeting you. I hope I didn't alarm you. Oh, no. That's fine. Since we both seem to have a certain fondness for Dalmatians. Yes. (PONGO BARKS) (BOTH WHIMPERING) Well, they certainly have a certain fondness for each other. Don't they? Yeah. Well, Pongo... Your roving eye's gotten me in enough trouble for one day. Why don't you come with me? We'll go home. Um, are you sure you'll be all right? Perhaps, you should call your doctor. I'll be fine. Fine. Good luck with your bricks. If you have a concussion, you shouldn't be left alone, you know? (SIGHS) Pongo, you could have gotten me killed. You know that? (WHIMPERS) You risk losing your master for a brief frolic with a female. (DOGS BARKING) Come on. (GRUNTS) Jolly nice human, don't you think? Fools aren't born, Pongo. Pretty girls make them in their spare time. Shall we? Come on. Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you. (PONGO BARKING) You have it all wrong, Pongo. I'm simply trying to decide on a route home. I has nothing whatsoever to do with Anita. If that's even what her name is. (SIGHS) (BARKS) (GASPS) Perdy. (BRAKES SQUEALING) What is it? Oh! Pongo! Pongo! Easy! Easy! Easy! Oh. Ah! Perdy. (MAN YELLS) ANITA: Stop. Okay. Perdy, stop! Perdy! (ANITA YELLS) Look out! Ahhh! Oh. Ah! ANITA: Oh, I've never been rescued before. It was very exciting. And you were ever so sweet to give me a kiss. ROGER: That wasn't a kiss. That was mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. ANITA: Oh. Besides, it didn't work very well. You're supposed to lie flat on your back and remain still. I couldn't really do it properly with your arms around my neck. I'm ever so sorry. No, no. That's... Quite all right. (EXHALES DEEPLY) Well, you give a very good rescue. Thank you. Oh. (CHUCKLES) I think we have a problem. (SOFTLY) I think my dog is in love. (BOTH CHUCKLE) I think mine is, too. Why is that a problem? They are going to be broken-hearted when you leave. ANITA: Oh. Oh, I don't think I could bear to live with a broken-hearted Dalmatian. Yes, they are miserable when they're lonely. Well, we'd better think of something. I agree. Do you want another cup of marriage? Excuse me. Tea? Another cup of tea. You said marriage. Uh, marriage? Yes, that's what you said. I mean, you meant to say tea, but it came out "marriage." Oh, I'm sorry, uh... Do you want another cup of... Tea? I do. You... You do? I will. You will? If you ask me. Would you? Yes. MINISTER: For as much as Roger and Anita have consented together in holy wedlock, and have witnessed the same before God and this company, and thereto have given and pledged their troth either to other, and declared the same by giving and receiving of a ring, by joining of hands. I pronounce that they be man and wife together, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. ALL: Amen. MINISTER: God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, bless, preserve, and keep you. The Lord mercifully with his favor look upon you. And so fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace, that ye may so live together in this life, that in the world to come you may have life everlasting. Amen. ALL: Amen. (DOGS BARKING) (BELLS TOLLING) All right. Now, let me tell me tell you a bit about this bloke, Skinner, before we meet him. Now, supposedly, when he was quite young, his dog tore open his throat and ripped out his vocal chords, leaving him brutally scarred and completely mute. He cannot talk at all. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Now, pay... Look at me. Pay attention, this is very important. There are two things you must not do to Skinner. All right. One. Do not look at the horrendous scar on his neck. Two. Don't talk to him. Understand? Not a word. Right. Oh! Look at the size of that scar. No bloody wonder you can't talk, mate. (GRUNTS) Excuse me, just a minute, would you? (PUNCHING) God, bloody gruesome line of work you're in, Skinner. Sight of all these deceased creatures gives me a shrinky winky. (CLEARS THROAT) Much obliged, sunshine. How could she do this to me? (MUMBLES) Morning, ma'am. Sit. Tea? Er, please. Er, please. (DISHES CLATTERING) Thank you. Thank you. Oh, well. What a beautiful day, ma'am. Blue skies, birds singing. Laughter of school children riding on gentle... Get on with it, you imbecile! (CLEARS THROAT) Well, I... I have here a present from Mr. Skinner. (EXHALES DEEPLY) (GASPS) Oh. It's magnificent. Hello, my beauty. Oh, God. Come. Come with me. Come with me, my darling. Let me see you. Oh. You were a big bad boy, weren't you, darling? Yes, yes, yes. Siberian tiger suits madam very well indeed. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the fairest of them all? (IN DEEP VOICE) You are. NANNY: I remember you were always very good at drawing when you were a little girl. And now to be with you again as you start a family of your own is like a dream come true. Oh, Nanny. I don't think Roger and I are quite ready to start a family yet. Oh, that's a shame. Ah, well. First, the puppies. Then, the babies. Puppies? (KEYBOARD CLACKING) If I've done my job right, Pongo, when this new villain comes up, you're gonna run from the room in a panic. (WHINES) (BARKS) Gotcha. (GRUNTS) (SIGHS) It's unmistakable, dear. NANNY: It's the look every woman gets when she knows she's going to be a mother. Notice how tranquil she is. Her eyes are soft and warm. Though you might not see it, you can certainly feel that she's smiling. It's the smile we wear when we're guarding a precious secret. And now that she's living for others as well as herself, she's eating more. And every now and again, for no reason other than she's so happy with herself, she sighs. (SIGHS) I think you're right, Nanny. I think she does look different. Oh, my goodness. What is it, Nanny? (WHIMPERS) Anita, I think you're going to have a puppy. Uh... Oh. (WHIMPERS) ANITA: Thank you so much. A month's time for a check-up, yes? All right. Bye-bye. See you again soon. (ANITA SIGHS) So? Well, he said that it's all great. Um, baby's nice and big. It's right about... That's wonderful. (INDISTINCT TALKING) Oh, no. What? Cruella? Anita, darling. (CHUCKLES) (PONGO BARKS) Oh, Anita. Those dazzling dogs. And you must be Rufus. Uh, no. It's Roger. And it's a pleasure, Miss De Vil. What's a pleasure? Uh, making your acquaintance. Such a sweet thought. I wish I could reciprocate. Tell me, darling, you married him for his dog. (CHUCKLES) Oh, darling. I've missed you so. I hate that you've taken leave. Uh, but I'm still working. You've been getting my sketches. Well, it's not the same thing. I miss the interaction. And what is it that you do, that allows you to support Anita in such splendor. I design video games. Video games? Mm-hmm. Is he having me on? Oh, no. He's very good at it. And it's a growing business. Those horrible noisy things that children play with on their television, someone designs them? What a senseless thing to do with your life. Oh, did Anita tell you the news? She's going to have a baby. Is this true? (CHUCKLES) Yes. Oh, you poor thing. I'm so sorry. (CHUCKLES) We're very excited about it, Cruella. You can't be serious. She is. Well, what can I say? Accidents will happen. We're having puppies, too. Oh. Puppies? You have been a busy boy. (GRUNTS) Well, I must say that's somewhat better news. I adore puppies. I'll expect a decline in your work product. Oh, I shouldn't think so. Be sure to let me know when the blessed event occurs. Oh, well, it won't be for another eight months. The puppies, darling. (WHIMPERING) (BARKING) I've no use for babies. (LAUGHS) Cheerio. Cheerio, darling. (BARKS SOFTLY) (WHIMPERING) (THUNDER CRASHING) (CLOCK TICKING) If I'm this nervous about your puppies, what am I gonna be like when my baby arrives? How can you be so calm? (PERDY WHIMPERING) Nanny! (GASPS) (BARKING) Oh, my goodness! (PONGO CONTINUES BARKING) Gangway! (MUMBLING) Is there something I can do? Maybe... Maybe I can be of some help. (THUNDER CRASHING) Right. Get out, peek in through the window and see if those puppies have come yet. Can I borrow your umbrella? Be careful when you open it. They're here! The puppies are here. You're a father, Pongo! (PONGO BARKING) NANNY: Two! Two! (PONGO BARKING) You're a father twice! - NANNY: Make that three. - ROGER: Three! Three, Pongo! Three puppies! - NANNY: Oh, my goodness! Four! - ROGER: Four! (THUNDER CRASHING) (CLOCK TICKING) (PONGO WHIMPERING) Fifteen! (PONGO WHIMPERING) Did you hear that, boy? Fifteen puppies! Fourteen. We lost one. I'm sorry, Pongo, I'm so sorry. (PONGO WHIMPERING) (WHISPERING) I wonder. (PONGO WHIMPERING) (PUPPY WHIMPERING) Fifteen! We have 15 puppies! (BARKING) What... Oh! NANNY: Goodness, gracious! It's a miracle! (BARKING) Anita, 15! Fifteen again. (CHUCKLES) We must call this one Lucky. Look. Look at him! Aww, hmm! (CHUCKLES) Oh! How's Perdy? She's tired. Oh! Bringing 15 puppies into the world, I guess she's got the right. Yeah. They're so beautiful. (SIGHING) You can go in now, Pongo. Here we are, Perdy. Yes, it's Lucky! NANNY: Now make room, you others. There we are, and well done, Perdy. There's a good girl. (PONGO BARKS) (PERDY WHIMPERING) I'll leave you two alone. (PUPPIES WHIMPERING) I'm glad I'm only having the one. (LAUGHS) Hmm. (THUNDER CRASHING) Anita? Anita? There you are. Where are the puppies? They should've arrived by now. How marvelous. (IN EVIL VOICE) How marvelous! (PUPPIES WHIMPERING) How perfect... Oh. The devil take it! They're mongrels! No spots. No spots at all. What horrible little white rats! (CHUCKLES) But their spots don't come till later. You're sure? Yes. All right. Put them in a bag. I'll take them with me now! What? They were just born. I can see that! But, Cruella, the puppies have to be with their mother for several weeks. They're not ready to leave. Fine, put the little brutes on reserve for me. How much would you like? (SIGHS) They're not for sale. Oh! You've come into some money, have you? Did you design some silly game that would drive the delinquent kiddies into frenzies of video delight? As a matter of fact, I have... No, no. No! What Roger means to say is that we're not sure we're going to sell the puppies. Anita, don't be ridiculous. You can't possible afford to keep them. I'll pay twice what they're worth. Come now, I'm being more than generous. £500 Oh! £7,500, fair? £2 per spot! (LAUGHING) Cruella, what would you do with 15 puppies? Yeah, that is irrelevant, Anita. She can't have any because they're not for sale. I'm getting very tired of you, Roland. Roger! Whatever! Take it. (WHISPERS) Take it. (SCREAMS) Take it! (THUNDER CRASHING) Cruella, the puppies are not for sale. You're quite sure? Yes. Yes. All right. Keep the little beasts. Do what you like with them. Drown them, for all I care. You're a fool, Anita. I've no use for fools. You're fired! You're finished! You'll never work in fashion again. I'm through with all of you! I'll get even! Just wait, you'll be sorry! You fools! You idiots! (GRUNTS) Good evening, madam. (GRUNTS) Oh! Out of my way! (DOG BARKING) Hello, Pongo. ♪ Oh, everybody wants ♪ ♪ to be a cat ♪ ♪ Everybody, everybody ♪ ♪ Everybody wants to be a cat ♪ MAN: (ON TV) Come on you two, let's go home. (PONGO BARKS) Thank you, Pongo. They're here. I've got them. Anita, Roger! I'm in the living room. Now, come on down and have a look. (PUPPIES YELPING) Oh, you as well. You heard that, didn't you? Wait till you see what I've got for you in this bag. Ha! Oh! (LAUGHS) Jewel. (JEWEL WHIMPERING) Aw! Let me put this on you. (JEWEL WHIMPERING) Dipstick. Come on. (ANITA LAUGHS) That a boy. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I know. Mmm-hmm. Fidget. (FIDGET WHIMPERING) Here. (NANNY LAUGHS) (PUPPIES WHIMPERING) Two-Tone I know, I know. You all like to do that. (LAUGHS) Here we go, here we go. (WIZZER WHIMPERING) Wizzer. Wizzer. (ROGER AND ANITA TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Right, we're on. (GRUNTS) Get... Get your own. (PUPPIES SNORING) NANNY: Somebody didn't finish their supper. We're on a budget. "Waste not, want not," that's my motto. (DOORBELL RINGS) Who on earth? (DOORBELL RINGS) Coming, coming. (DOORBELL RINGS) Coming. Good evening, madam. Oh! My goodness. (YELLING) It's all right, lady. We're professionals. (GRUNTS) Come here. (ALL GROANING) Let go of me. Right, get her off! I'm gonna... (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (YELLING) Let go of me. Straight ahead. Straight ahead. All right. Don't push! Help! Police! (PUPPY WHIMPERING) In you go. No. Ow! Fingers. Let me out of here! Let me out! NANNY: Open the door! Open this door! Oh, do shut up! NANNY: Police, police! I'll see you go to jail for this if it's the last thing I do! (BANGING ON THE DOOR) Help! Police! Well, the old bird put up a good fight. I like that. I like a bit of sprit in a woman. That's all right for you to say. You didn't get smashed in the face. (SHUSHING) (PUPPY WHIMPERING) (PUPPY BARKS) Aww! Give me the bag. Come on, come on. Here. (PUPPY YELPING) (GROANS) All right. Come here, you. Spotty little dog. (PUPPIES WHIMPERING) (DOG BARKS) Good evening, General. Montgomery, heel, boy! Heel, boy, heel! Jasper? Do you know what I think? What's that? I think that bulldog knows what we've just done. It's a dog, Horace. Dogs ain't got the brains to figure things out. Come on. At ease, boy. Luckily. (PUPPIES WHIMPERING) Come on home. (DISTANT DOGS BARKING) (DISTANT DOGS BARKING) (BARKS) I mean, I think... (SCREAMING) Pongo! Perdy! (GASPS) Police! Where are they? Oh, no! They've taken the puppies. Anita! Oh! Roger. Thank God, they're home! Oh, thank goodness, you've come. What happened? What is it? The puppies. They were two men. They've stolen the puppies. I tried to stop them. They locked me in the cupboard. I shouted and shouted but nobody came. (PHONE RINGING) (CLEARS THROAT) Ah, good evening, madam. I sincerely hope I have not disturbed your relaxation, but I have some good news. Did you get the puppies? Affirmative. All of them? Every single one. My faith in your limited intelligence is momentarily restored. Oh! (CHUCKLES) You are too kind, madam. (CALL DISCONNECTS) We've got the 15! Add them to the other puppies we've already stolen. And I have my cozy, puppy coat. (SINISTER LAUGH) (LAUGHS) I'll be wearing Anita's dogs. (CRUELLA LAUGHING) (LAUGHING WICKEDLY) (PUPPIES WHIMPERING) (PUPPY BARKS) (DOG BARKING) (PUPPY BARKS) Right, well, I'm gonna fill my snoot and go to bed. I'm dead tired. I'm hearing dogs again, Jasper. Oh! Shut up in there. (DOG BARKS) (BARKS) WOMAN: (ON RADIO) Tango-Foxtrot-23, report progress on missing canines, over. INSPECTOR: You keep your chin up. We'll do our best. Thank you, Inspector. Goodnight, ma'am. Goodnight. He was most sympathetic. He says they're going to do the best they can. (SIGHING) For what that's worth. Do you think they'll find them? ROGER: How're they gonna find 15 little puppies in a city this size. If they're even in the city. What can the police do? What can we do? What can anyone do? (PONGO BARKING) (PONGO CONTINUES BARKING) (DISTANT DOGS BARKING) (PONGO BARKING) Woof. Woof! Woof!

Pongo! (SCREAMS) Pongo! (DOG BARKING) (WHIMPERING) (THUDDING) Did you hear that? (SIGHS) What? That noise? What noise? That noise that I just heard! Did you hear it? (SIGHS) Oh, yeah, yeah. It sounded just like a complete berk asking me irritating questions. Oh, good. It's stopped now. (WHIMPERING) I'll be honest with you, mate. This job is fast losing its charm! The housing stinks, food's lousy. The lavatory facilities are appalling. And so far, we haven't been paid so much as one quid. Oh! Will you stop moaning? Look, this time tomorrow night, it's all over. We get our boodle, we'll be out of here before you can say, "Dead puppies." Now, go to sleep. (SIGHS) (SNIFFING) (WHIMPERING) (WHIMPERING) (MOUSE SQUEAKING) (PUPPIES YELPING) (PHONE RINGS) Mr. Skinner, suspicions are mounting, police are everywhere. I want the job done tonight. Can you do it? (TAPPING ON THE PHONE) Any way you want. Poison them, drown them. Bash them on the head. Got any chloroform? I don't care how you kill the little beasts, just do it and do it now! (CROW CAWS) ANITA: Pongo and Perdy will turn up, won't they? If you ask me, they will. I think they just went looking for the puppies. You know who did this, don't you? I, for one, wouldn't be the least bit surprised. She has a terrible temper on her. The dogs never cared for her. Dogs have a sixth sense about things like that. They can smell ill intentions. Roger. What? What's wrong? Nanny, what did I do with my portfolio? Uh, it's in the nursery closet, dear. Anita? She did steal the puppies and this is why. (CRYING) She's going to kill the puppies. (BIRD TWITTERING) (BARKS) (BIRD CHIRPING) (BARKING) (CHATTERING) (SQUEAKING) (JASPER GROANING) Right, that's it. Time to let the little yappers have it. We ain't supposed to do it. That's Skinner's job. Well, Skinner isn't here, is he? Besides, I don't see why that little runt should have all the fun. (GLASS SHATTERING) How'd you wanna do it? Well, personally, I think I favor the fire iron. (SCREAMS) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (STAMMERS) Right, that'll be Miss De Vil. Fix your shirt and tart up your hair. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Good evening... Hello? Anybody there? (KNOCK ON DOOR) (DOGS WHIMPERING) Maybe we was hearing things. (BIRD CHIRPING) (CAR HORN HONKING) (HONKING CONTINUES) Oi! Get out of my truck! Yeah! (SNORING) Go on, get out of here! Clear out! Yeah. There's plenty more where that came from, should you elect to come back. (WIZZER WHIMPERING) (BARKS) (BARKS) I don't believe it. HORACE: I don't care what you say, we bloody well better be careful. JASPER: Yeah, that's right, what we better be careful of is the huge, thundering, macroeconomic bulk of your stupidity. HORACE: I ain't taking anymore lip from you, mate. JASPER: Oh, forget about that. We have got 99 stinking puppies to find and kill. Now get on with it. (BARKS) JASPER: Here, puppies. Here, puppies. Pup, pup, pup, pup, puppies! (PUPPY BARKS) Come here, you speckled lab rat. (GROANS) Ahhh! (SPITTING) Ugh! (LAUGHS) (PUPPY BARKS) Stay! (PUPPY BARKS) You... Oh, come here I'm gonna get you, you little... Ahhh! (SCREAMING) Cold. (SHIVERING) JASPER: Good evening, madam. Good evening. Hello. What are you doing up there? I am... I was just fetching the puppies, ma'am. And where are the puppies? Oh, there, you see, once again, Madam has, like a laser, gone straight to the heart of the issue. It's a quality I've always admired. "Where are the puppies?" "Where are the puppies?" It's brilliant. Well, let me just say, um, right now, that I'm not absolutely 100% certain where the puppies are, but if you'll just give me a second, I will check with my associate. Uh, Horace! Get down from there, and catch those puppies! Hopelessly stupid, pathetic fools. I'll find the bloody mongrels myself. (ENGINE SPUTTERING) You just had to let those puppies get away, didn't you? Never paying attention. Oh, where was you? Where... I was not splashing around in the pond. You've infuriated the old bag, and if we don't get those puppies back then it's quite literally our heads. (ENGINE SPUTTERING) Oh, come on! Right, you better get out and check the tail pipe, we've got a condensation problem. One of these days, I'm gonna be full up of you. (SPUTTERING CONTINUES) Oh, do come on! (TAIL PIPE BLOWS) There, you see? (WHIMPERS) (GROWLING) (BLEATING) (DOG BARKING) (LUCKY WHIMPERING) (WHIMPERING) (LUCKY WHIMPERING) (WHIMPERING) (JAWS SNAPPING) (FABRIC RIPS) Turn the heater on, will you? No. Not with this thing acting the way she is, I don't wanna risk losing power. I can't stand the cold no more. I want heat. Fire! Too hot! Too hot! (SCREAMING) (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) Your suspicions were justified. According to the staff, Miss De Vil left earlier for a family property in Suffolk. I have informed the local police. Officers there will be on the lookout for your puppies. And Miss De Vil. I only hope we're not too late. (CAWING) (BARKS) (CHICKENS CLUCKING) (PIGS GRUNTING) (MOOING) (DOGS BARK) (BURPS) (CACKLING) (CAWS) (CAWING) (BARKS) (PUPPIES YAPPING) Oh! This is extraordinary. I'm reduced to tramping through sewage, because my two imbeciles can't keep track of a bunch of infant dogs. (HORSE NEIGHING) (SCREAMING) (NEIGHING) JASPER: I do not believe it. We got no truck, no dogs. We are so dead. Number One Dead Street, that's us. Look! Tracks. I love you. There you are, you see, if dogs are so smart they wouldn't leave tracks, for wary predators such as us. HORACE: Yeah. Now, I've always said, human beings are essentially superior. You know, blessed with faculties of speech, and thought and a couple of other things. (WHIMPERS) Don't worry, I'm not gonna ruin your little puppy coat, I'm just gonna make a few button holes. Where are you, you filthy beast? (PUPPY WHIMPERS) Oh, yes! I love the smell of near extinction. (PIG SQUEALS) (GROANS) (BARKS) (PIG GRUNTING) Oh, oh, oh! (PIG FARTS) Stupidity, you see. That's your problem, that's what has been holding you back. If it was up to you, you would have taken hold of that wire, set fire to your undershorts, cooked your tongue before even thinking it was electrified. Point taken. But what are the logs for? You see, we stand upon the logs and hop over, thereby avoiding painful electric shock. Brilliant. Right. Mount the log. Extend leg. All right, now when I count to three, we jump. Ready? Yes. One. (GRUNTS) (BOTH SCREAMING) (SIZZLING) (EXPLOSION) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) Useless, disgusting creatures. I'm sick to think we breathe the same air. (DISTANT DOGS BARKING) Ah! Bingo! Poor little things. I'm gonna cut you off, then cut you up. (WICKEDLY LAUGHING) (CHITTERING) Darling, red isn't your color. Give me the hat. Give me the hat, or you'll become a hat. (CHITTERING) Give it to me! (CLUCKING) (CHITTERING) (SCREAMS) Oh! (STRAINING) Oh! (SIREN WAILING) (SIRENS WAILING) (SIRENS APPROACHING) Thank the Lord. We're saved. POLICEMAN: There you go. - Thank you, again. - Much obliged. - POLICEMAN: Nice and easy. Watch your heads. Thank you. This is lovely. Isn't it? Nice and warm. No animals neither. (GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) (PANTING) You beasts! But I'm not beaten yet. You won the battle, but I'm about to win the wardrobe. My spotted puppy coat is in plain sight, and leaving tracks. In a moment, I'll have what I came for, while all of you will end up as sausage meat. Alone on some sad, plastic plate. Dead and medium red. No friends, no family, no pulse. Just slapped between two buns, smothered in onions, with fries on the side. Cruella De Vil has the last laugh. (WICKEDLY LAUGHING) (WHINNIES) (SCREAMING) (WHINNIES) (MOOING) (CLUCKING) (GRUNTS) Oh! (BREATHING HEAVILY) (SIRENS WAILING) Miss De Vil. Yes. We have a warrant for your arrest. Oh. Is there something wrong? Stop! What's that up ahead? Well, will you look at that. (CHUCKLES) (BREAKS WIND) (POLICEMEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY) I've come up with 98 pups. The two adults make it 100 even. We've got 100 here, sir. (BARKS) Um, make that 101 Dalmatians, sir. (BARKING) (BOTH BARKING) Congratulations. You've just won gold, silver and bronze, in the morons' Olympics. Who won the gold? Shut up! My business. My reputation. My life, has been ruined because you three incompetent twits, let yourselves be outsmarted by a bunch of dumb animals, and you call yourselves men, huh? I've seen more intelligent pieces of carpet. (ALL SCREAMING) They're here. Anita, Roger. The puppies. Oh, my goodness, look at them. Oh! Good boy. NANNY: They're happy to be home! Oh, thank you, Officer, how can we ever repay you? Well. Your dogs were the only ones with identification tags, we have no idea which puppy goes where. Our records indicate that so far nobody has called to claim the other puppies. Now, they need a home. Or, well, they go to the pound. (BOTH BARKING) Oh, no, no! No, no, no. Roger we can't, we don't have room. Well, we'll get a bigger place. We have 17 as it is, what's a few more? We'll work something out. (BARKS) You'll have dozens of children, you know? Well, I won't have them chewing up the carpets, barking at all hours of the night. (WHINES) All right, everyone inside before we all get cold. Unload the puppies. (BARKING) Get ready, get ready. (CRUELLA LAUGHS) (LAUGHING WICKEDLY) (PUPPIES WHIMPERING) Ahhh! Cool! Excellent villain, mate! Thanks, Herbert. Congratulations. Huh, what, yeah, thank you. Thank you. See you in my office, we've got terms to sort out. Okay, good. Excellent villain, mate. (BOTH LAUGH) ROGER: I can barely believe it, our baby is a year old, we have a new house, a new life. And we have each other. (CHUCKLES) We have Nanny. And I have the three of you. We have two wonderful dogs. And they have their children. And their step-children. And they have their children. Their step-children have children. ANITA: And their children have children. NANNY: And speaking of children. ANITA: Roger, darling, I've got the most wonderful news.
