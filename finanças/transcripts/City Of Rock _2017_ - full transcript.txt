Now let's welcome to the stage Hu Liang from Class 2, Grade 3. The topic of his speech is "My Hometown." Ah! My hometown is a beautiful town called Ji'an. It's quiet and ordinary. Yet! Because of a band, dramatic changes took place here. Who could even imagine that the well-known band "Broken Guitar" comes from a border town by the name of Ji'an? And the 4 members are all doctors. Let's talk to them. Well... where should I look? At the camera. You know, I... kind of...you know... Let's have Dr. Song speak! Don't... don't film me! Say something! Don't film me! I'm too dark to be on camera. Ask him. He's the chief surgeon. He's got the guts. Keep away from me, sister. I'm married. Are you this shy when you're on stage? Broken Guitar! Broken Guitar! Broken Guitar! From then on, my hometown got a new name: The City of Rock. One day, I'll start my own band, and roar out songs for my hometown! Let's rock'n'roll! Ji'an!

Have you practiced? Show me. Bro Gong... We want to sing. Did I tell you not to? I only asked you to dance while you sing. We play rock'n'roll. Wouldn't it be unprofessional if we danced with the song? Look at yourself! You look like an ugly genetically modified catfish. And you talk about "being professional." You think you're professional? What's the benefit? I've been sponsoring you for 4 years. You've only earned 67 yuan for me. Pre-tax, too! Now, I'm even too poor to afford cigarettes! We have to change directions. I've raised some money. I'm taking you to Korea, where you'll rebuild your faces and then make your debut. Say farewell to rock'n'roll and hello to singing and dancing. Then you'll be marketed back in China from abroad. I'll take you guys to meet someone. Listen. Either dance or get lost. Where is he? Dear Cheng, how is everything going? Right now, I'm roaming about in the clouds. It's such a thrilling operation that I finally understood what hovers in the space between life and death. Money is simply a number. I am already unrivaled in the field of selling long johns. Before I was short-sighted. This double-eyelid surgery opened my eyes and incidentally, it opened my mind. As for the 500,000 yuan of investment I promised you, it's over. Aha! I mean turn the page over. I'm offering the 500,000 to you in the form of long johns. You'll definitely like the rock'n'roll style. After all, you once worked with the great Broken Guitar. Don't try to look for me. I'm no longer who I was. I'm a slave to love. I'm a child of the sun. All the goods are here. OPEN YOUR EYES How is everything going, Agent Cheng? I've got something to tell you. I'm a fan of rock 'n 'roll from Ji'an, a town in the northeast. I'm 27 years old. My... My name is Hu Liang. I'm the lead singer of a band. We're weak in concert promotion. So, I need you, oh, to help me. Solo! OPEN YOUR EYES Hello? Hello! Who's this? You made the call and you're asking me who I am? Are you the former agent of Broken Guitar? Are you Mr. Cheng? Who are you? Oh, my lord! It's me, Mr. Cheng! Hu Liang! I sent you a video asking for cooperation on Microblog. How is everything going, Agent Cheng? Hold on... How did you get my number? The numbers in front of your email address look like a cell phone number. So, I dialed it. And guess what? Turns out a top notch like you never cared about your privacy! Sloppy! I gotta go. No, no, no, don't do that, bro! Mr. Cheng, would you consider my invitation? It'll only take a month to be the agent of my band and help me promote my concert in Ji'an. You can make a request. I'm not interested! Please...we can talk. Just name your price. Name a price? 500,000 yuan. 100,000 yuan has been transferred to your debit card account. I'm going to make some quick money in the Northeast. When I get back, I'll take you to Korea. Remember to practice dancing. Sell the long johns in the street in your spare time. FAMOUS AGENT MR. CHENG GONG Hi. Are you Mr. Cheng? Yeah. Music! Cue the flowers! Okay, okay. Who is this guy? You don't know him? He is the famous music agent from Beijing, Mr. Cheng Gong. Hi, everyone! The band Broken Guitar split up because of him! Come on! Take a photo with the celebrity. If you've got the Kuaishou App, just upload it. We're home! Roll Prince Garage? Which prince did you breed enmity with? Well, bro. It was Rock 'n' Roll Prince Garage. The first character was blown away. Who is the rock'n'roll prince? You already know the answer! Come on in, brother. Make yourself at home. Come in. Take a seat anywhere. Take a seat, bro. Well, my shorts... Sit down. I'm worn out. Bro, stay here from now on. We two will share a bed! No, thanks. I'll just go to a hotel. Bro, I can't afford to pay for the hotel. The 100,000 yuan I transferred to you was a down payment. That's all I have. What? You're saying you don't have money? Yes, I do have money, but I don't have it right now. My house is going to be demolished soon. All the removal compensation will be yours. Besides, bro, aren't I paying in... in installments? Installments? I still need to be paid regularly. If I'm not paid for a single day, I'll go back to Beijing. Prince? Just look at the mess here. It'll be okay if I just clean it up! Well, isn't this the actual style of a rock 'n 'roll prince? Look at the double room. It'll be tidy in a minute. Bro, look! This is the famous Grand Guitar that the municipal government of Ji'an built in honor of Broken Guitar. Bro, this is a gift from Song from on stage. I've been wearing it all along. Cool. It's a nice black leather string. It was red. I've been wearing it for a long time, so... Gross! Bro, a few days ago, I heard that the government wants to remove it. Then the Park of Rock is going to be used for real estate. I said no. Removing the guitar has nothing to do with you. They don't need your permission. As long as they leave the guitar alone they can screw me over. Let's talk about it later. Take a photo for me. Wait a minute, bro. Please do me a favor. September 30th is the 20th anniversary of Broken Guitar's performance in Ji'an. I want to throw a concert that day, right here, to raise awareness for the whole city, and to show the municipal leaders that our rock'n'roll spirits haven't died! That the park can't be demolished! Alright, forget about it. I'll take a photo for you. In case it does get removed, right? Bro Gong, I'll design a pose for you. Do you know what they call me? The Pose Terminator of Ji'an! How about this? Do that classic rock pose. The hot wheels. Exactly! Just swing. Swing freely! Faster! Faster! Keep it down. Like this? Yep! Swing. Come on I'm going to take the shot. IRON-BLOODED LOVERS RIDE ACROSS CHINA Have you taken it already? Yes! Soooooo cool! Look at the helmets. Awesome! One. Two. Three. It's good! Sometimes God is funny. How did I get you into bed with me? Don't touch me. Go to sleep, all right? Take me to see the other band members. Other members? You think there are other members? The person lying beside you is the only member of the band. Stop kidding around. I'm not kidding. But you said you had a band! I'll have a band if you help me form one! Why did you get an agent without having a band? You're hurting me! It hurts? I'm hurting you, huh? It hurts, huh? Bro, why are you turning me down like this? Are you going for a night run? Damn you! Buy me a ticket to Beijing! Hey, bro! Bro, I've already given you the down payment. Bro! Still care about me, huh? Are you out of your mind? Hey! Even if you're dead I won't care! What do you want? Stay and help me. Let go of me! If you don't promise me today, I'll be part of your leg, and become part of your body! You're going to make a scene? Where's my phone? What are you doing, bro? What are you doing? Calling the police. Please, bro! I'm begging you! I'll give you another 50,000 to help me form a band. Okay? 70,000.00 60,000.00 80,000! 70,000! 100,000! 100,000! 110,000! Let's make it 100,000! 150,000! We agreed to 100,000! Since it's settled, why are you still bargaining? So, it's 100,000 yuan. Let me tell you something, bro. Ji'an is a city of rock. We've got plenty of musicians here. We just need to pass out flyers. There'll be a huge crowd tomorrow waiting to be interviewed. What a huge crowd! You think we'll have to interview all day? I WANT YOU. JOIN MY BAND. The address is right. All right. Let's get started. Tell us about your dreams. Could you please introduce yourselves? Ding Jianguo. I'm a bassist. Ding Jian... Excuse me, Ding...? Jianguo (). I'm a bassist. It's a powerful name, huh? Jianguo. Explosive. I'm a drummer. It's even more powerful. Gao Hongjie. I'm a tractor driver. I'm here to get my vehicle repaired. Beat it! Okay. Let's stay focused. Ms. Ding, why do you want to join our band? I just broke up, so I need a distraction. That's quite a reason! Quite a reason. Right? And your leg? Long, white and slim. Want to touch it? Maybe later. Mr. Explosive? I'm from Taiwan. I just want to make a living. Cool. After meeting with the committee, we have carefully decided that you two before us fully meet our requirements. Congratulations. You're in. The rehearsal will be here at 7pm tomorrow. Bro. What's up? Hold on. Bro. That's it? Yep. Then I've spent my 100,000 on this? Aren't they good? What? One is on a crutch. The other looks shabby! Are we forming a band or a traveling beggars gang? What do you mean? You love legs? You can have mine. Touch it. Play with it. Come on. Ouch! It hurts! We only have less than one month. What's your idea then? Tell me. If it doesn't work, I can take you to meet someone. Who's there? Go away! Hu, don't ever ask me again. My wife said she'd beat you to death if you invite me to join your band one more time. She isn't Ji'an's only Taekwondo black belt for nothing. What? Shut up! Listen, It's only one month. What do you want? I have no time. I have classes in the daytime and piano lessons at night. In my spare time, I've got to teach her to play the piano privately. So, it's impossible. Why are you playing the piano privately? My mom said playing the piano is neither promising nor profitable. She told me to learn math, physics, chemistry, and grow up to be like my grand uncle in Beijing and research the atomic bomb. See? If a woman manages household affairs, the house can collapse. She wanted to beat me? I'll show you how I'll teach her a lesson. Honey, please stay calm. Qiao Dashan! Don't worry. Let's see what she's got! Xixi, what's the benefit of learning to play the piano? Because your dad learned to play the piano, he became a music teacher. Because he became a music teacher, his salary is only 1,700 yuan per month. Because he only makes 1,700 yuan per month, your grandma could only afford to take the bus. Because your grandma had to run after the bus, she tumbled down the street. Because she tumbled down the street, she ended up getting a phyiscal exam at the hospital. Because she got a physical exam at the hospital, she was diagnosed with liver cancer. Because the cancer was already at stage 4, your grandma died early at age 97. So what's the moral of your dad's story? If you play the piano well Mom dies early. You want me to die early? Nope. So, what are we going to do now? Study hard in math and research the atomic bomb when I grow up. CENTER FOR GYNECOLOGY. NO MEN PLEASE. How far along are you? I'm not pregnant. You're just fat? You got punched and came to see the gynecologist? What are you talking about! I want you to meet someone. Look! The man over there is the great emperor of guitar. Yang Shuangshu. Who the hell is he? He was Broken Guitar's lead guitarist before they were famous. He fell down on stage because of his migraine. After he left, the band became famous. He's got no luck. Ouyang Nana. Have mercy on me, Monkey King! I'm just an ordinary young lady. Dr. Yang. Sorry about that. We're closed now. You could bring your wife tomorrow. Dr. Yang, we want to talk to you about creating a band. Biao Biao, go play outside for a while. The Grand Guitar is connected to my band from before. It is my unavoidable responsibility. But I promised my daughter, for the sake of my own health, to quit rock'n'roll. to quit rock'n'roll. Dr. Yang, Broken Guitar has split, and the Rock'n'roll Park will be removed soon. In a couple of years, when you pass away, the children of Ji'an will never know about rock'n'roll! Dr. Yang, the rock'n'roll of Ji'an needs you. You have to play! Save it. It's such a big cause. Don't count on a sick doctor like me. You young guys alone can pursue your dreams. Dr. Yang, back then when you fell down on stage you were different. You said it would be most honorable for a rock musician to die on stage! If you don't even go on stage, how can you expect to die on one? I was only acting. Acting? What are you going to do? You want to kidnap my phone? I'm calling the police, you old fraud! I... I spit on you in the name of Sailor Moon! You are a fraud! You don't deserve rock'n'roll! Fraud! I don't deserve it? Dr. Yang, what's this? FRIEND OF WOMEN THE GREAT EMPEROR OF GUITAR Dr. Yang. Hello! Hello! Do you want to report to the police? Hello. Hello. I confess! I'm too young and ignorant. I didn't know he was so amazing! The whole room is full of guitars! You see, I'm at the gynecologist's. Dr. Yang, please don't be angry. You've been a doctor for so many years, yet you can't tell this man is sick. Just tell me. Can you keep playing rock'n'roll? To be honest, my migraines were caused by alcohol. Since I quit drinking, I haven't had any more attacks. But still, my daughter doesn't trust me. She said, if she ever sees me playing the guitar, there'll be no way for me to remarry. If I can figure out a way to hide it from your daughter, are you in? Today is a very important day. It's the day our band is born. - Bro, you're so strong-willed. - I can tell you are all very delighted. First, please introduce yourselves. My name is Hu Liang and I'm the heart and soul of this band, the lead singer! How about I do the introductions? This person with the Sailor Moon mask is our lead guitarist. Bassist Ding Jianguo. Explosive the drummer. Keyboardist Qiao Meixi. Hello, everyone. Come on! She's only a kid. Who cares? She can play. Bro, what's wrong with you? I thought you were in? - But you just brought a kid! - Piss off. Well, I'm too scared to join the band. But! Xixi has her dream of persistently pursuing music! I should give her my unconditional support. Xixi, promise me. I promise not to tell mom where you hid your money. Not that. I will play hard. Then I'm leaving now. Send her home when you're done. I'll cover for you. See you. The strength of a father's love! I gave him 500 yuan. It's on you. What? Remember to pay me back. Come on! Let's rehearse. Come on, Xixi! Let's get started. Instruments are over there. Let me help you. No, thanks. Is she the one? Hey Gong, this was the first electric guitar in Ji'an. He fell down the stage with her in his arms. This is the original custom black one from 1960. She's the Liu Yan of all guitars. So hot. Look at her graceful figure. What's the problem? Fuck off! What's wrong, old man? Hu Liang, it's your fault. You think just anyone can touch Liu Yan? You might even break it. But it's okay to take a photo. Come on. Go ahead. It can be used as your funeral pic. Go ahead. No, let's rehearse. It's okay. Hey bro, your drum set's facing the wrong way! Turn it around. Are you an amateur? It's the way I beat. Replace me if you don't like it. Are 90s kids all arrogant like him? Who are these people you've found? An alcoholic. A loner. A kid. And a grandpa. These amateurs are going to save the Grand Guitar? Are you kidding me? What kind of normal people would want to be with you? What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? Someone with a lisp wants to be the lead singer. Let's start. I don't have a lisp when I sing! We'll run into a lot of issues on our first rehearsal. Don't worry. We can improvise and fix the problem. Explosive, drum something. It's too amateurish! It has no basic rhythm in there. He can't drum at all! Excellent! Fantastic! Energetic! Amazing! Awesome! Attention, please! Allow me to formally introduce you to our off-stage staff. This gentleman is our band's backstage mastermind, the president of small chain grocery store Bonjavi, Old man Sun! No. No. No. It's not a small grocery store. It's a supermarket. I run a supermarket. It's a pleasure to meet you guys. My name is Sun Dali. By the way, all the instruments here are sponsored by him. Don't mention it. I've brought some gifts for you. It's quite fashionable. Hope you can wear it. Almost in every color. Well... I started living in a bird's eye view.> Turn it off, turn it off! You guys listen to the radio every day. Boss Fortune, why don't you go home first? Don't worry. We will escort Boss Jianguo home. Yes. Absolutely not. My relationship with Jianguo is at a turning point of love. According to my very reliable sources... there are only 3 people in here. According to my very reliable sources, Jianguo didn't break her leg from playing the dancing machine. You're only hearing this now? You already knew? Jianguo's boyfriend was cheating on her. He fell in love with her best friend Xiaomei. Jianguo saw them kissing each other when she was shopping. She tried to hit them with her car. But she broke her own leg. Ah we had the same rhyme, homie! Stop playing! What damn rhyme are you talking about? Why didn't you tell me? I paid more than 100,000 yuan for this information. What else do you know? Tell me. - Well... - Stop! You know, Jianguo plays music, right? Word has it...something... the tempo...has... Thanks Boss Fortune, Tell me now! Well, you know. I believe your relationship with her isn't at a turning point of love. What? I thought Jianguo was single again! I heard that Jianguo's ex is a lead singer of a band. See? They probably made up. Are they falling in love? Or are they acting? Jianguo likes round faces? Look at me. Is my face an oval shape? It can only be described as long. She is tired. She must be studying the atomic bomb too hard. Take it easy, little bro. That's my good grandson! Don't tell your mom about this, okay? Okay. Hurry up! Watch out! Get him. Don't touch me. Let's go! Dr. Yang... Wow! Bro, you're impressive! Do you always trick people like this in Beijing? No small talk. Let's go back. Hold on, bro. Here. What's this for? The payment installments, right? You're really nickel and diming it. I didn't see you when I got up to use the toilet last night. Where were you? I... I was writing songs. I thought you didn't want to sleep in the same bed. So, I'll just stay in the truck. So nice of you. By the way, Old Sun wants to learn to play the drums. I'll have Explosive teach him. The tuition is 5,000 yuan a month. Don't forget to collect it for me. Sure thing. But bro, I should give the money to Explosive, right? It's okay. He can have 300. May kind people be blessed with longevity and peace. Our band will play a series of shows I've scheduled. So, we must rehearse a song of our own. Let's welcome Hu Liang to sing his original song. This song "Plastic Bag" is for all of you. Wow! What do you think? Keep going. It's over. Your song only has two lines? Of course not! I only finished writing two lines. One week for two lines? Too fast or too slow? Hu Liang! I don't know how many nursing homes I blew up in my previous life, to meet a shit like you! Have any of you written a song before? Jianguo? I can try. There's no time. Let's practice this song. You wrote this? It doesn't matter. We can play now. Can you read the score? Of course. Hey, you wrote this? Cut the bullshit and just play! Target - Ji'an Nursing Home Supervisior Target - Construction Developer You must be Logger Vick! Yoga Studio Owner Target - Ex-boyfriend's House - You slept all day long! - Get up and rehearse! Thank you all! Thank you all! September 30th at Rock'n'roll Park! Be there or be square! Thank you for supporting Big Broken Truck! The name "Remarried Couple" won't work either. I fully understand why "Remarried Couple" fails to be chosen. But what's wrong with "Big Broken Truck"? That's totally my style! If it's about your style, then why don't you use Lisper? My suggestion, "Let Me Tell You" sounds great. My master is right. Yes, it is. What the hell? It's... you know band... It's too tricky for me. I can't pronounce it correctly! Stop discussing the ones that've been ruled out. Let's pick one between Xixi's "Little Beauty" and Jianguo's "Heavenly Hound." Let's vote. No need to vote then. Come! That's it! Then I vote for Heavenly Hound! The Heavenly Hound will eat the moon. - Beautiful - Cheers! and romantic! Isn't it, Jianguo? It has nothing to do with the moon. A bitch mates with a hound... That's heavenly. Heavenly Hound. Instead of Heavenly Hound, it should be called Mating Hound. "Check C"... You wrote it? I wrote it in school. Back then during my exams, I answered C on all the multiple choice questions. Within a minute I handed my paper and went to band practice. You formed a band before? Yep. I was the guitarist and the lead singer. But these past few days how come I didn't see you play the guitar? I can't play the guitar anymore. In college I went to go perform somewhere and I was hit by a drunk pedicab driver. My index finger and middle finger haven't been agile since then. A scissor hand forever. What brought you into the path of music? Ka Kui Wong was my idol when I was a kid. My dream was to sing his songs on stage. Every day, I begged my dad, "I want to play the guitar!" "I want to learn music!" But my family was poor. My dad was laid off. My mom was a housewife. She's been a housewife all her life. But I kept bothering my father every day. And after more than six months, finally one day, my dad beat me. Soon after that, I got my first ever guitar. Later, I found out my mom carried her sewing machine to the market and sewed and hemmed pants for people. Step by step, my mom helped me get enrolled at the conservatory of music. I entered the conservatory as a guitarist but graduated as scissor hand. You quit the band because of your fingers? No, I was expelled from school. I couldn't play the guitar so I didn't want to sing anymore. I went to Beijing and became a young agent. I was asked to be responsible for Broken Guitar's business. But no one loved rock'n'roll back then. So the band split in just a few days. I became the industry's laughing stock, and I was fired. Hu Liang, are you out of your mind? Bro, just relax! We'll never fire you! Forget the band name talk. Attention, please! Gong's mother used her sewing machine to support and help him achieve his accomplishments today. So from now on, our band will be called Bloody Hell Mother of Gong! Let's rock'n'roll, Sewing Machine! Grand Guitar, we're going to defend you! Boss Ding. I guess Jianguo is okay. She won't make any trouble now. Bullshit! If their concert succeeds, the government will see the audience's enthusiasm and feel the spirit of rock'n'roll. Then what'll happen to the land of Rock'n'roll Park? We've been working on it for more than 6 months. It's almost there. But I've been kicked by my own daughter. Oh, I see. I'm going to get rid of the band immediately. Idiot! What's our company's slogan? Say it again! Strategies come first before compulsory demolitions. Come on! I'm going to risk my life fighting you! I want to see! To anyone who dares remove my factory, I'll dig your grave! Come on! Go ahead! I'm impressed! You're a true man! Mr. Deng, right? Today I've come to bring you a small gift. Come on. Open it! I saved your brother from the casino in Macau. His debt has been paid off. The 3 million yuan in cash is yours. Just think about it. Are you okay with the demolition or not? Follow my orders. Hydraulic excavators in the back, come on! Drive ahead, young man. Just remove it. All of it. Go ahead. Come on. Just get rid of it. Demolish it! I already have a bad relationship with Jianguo. If I get rid of her band, she'll hate me forever. Giving up her position as Vice President at a big company... She just despises her dad. I have no idea where I went wrong. Hello, President Ding! Hello! Listen. Go behind her back. Don't let her know. Also, you keep that fool Fortune away from Jianguo! Go to Second Sister's Pork Intestines Noodle Shop. Those were my father-in-law's words? Don't push me too far, or I'll ask my father to withdraw his capital. And demand Jianguo marry me obediently. Make him behave like a father! The detectaphones are all set. Both upstairs and downstairs. Handsome, what's wrong with your handsome face? What happened? You got caught? The manhole cover near the doorway was broken. I might have fallen in the hole. You fell down?! - You must be... - Bro - Someone is talking. - Check the money. I can't believe you fell in the hole! What a yawn... - Here's 10,000 yuan. - I can see your shoe pads. - Go fall in the hole again. - Why are you so tired? What are you doing every day? Did you collect the 5,000 yuan from Old Sun? Well, do you remember the two on the Harleys? I gave the money to them to promote us with two big flags on their motorcycles. Hu Liang. Come here. Come. What's the problem? Let me look. What are you looking at? Do I have grey hair? I'm looking to see if it's a head or a toilet. Can I flush it? You're messing up my hairstyle! Why didn't you pay me back? Are those Harley riders reliable? Make a call! What for? Get the money back! What a damn fool! The bill's overdue? I'm going to recharge 100 yuan. What the hell are you talking about? - I can't stop laughing! - Both of them are frauds. Can't you see? The final payment is due before our performance. What are you doing? What are you doing? This is my hostage. Give it to me. Give it to me! Come on. I'll destroy it if I don't see the money! OK, I won't move. All right? I don't want to argue with you. I don't want to mess up my hair. I'm gonna see Sweety later, you know. Do you know Sweety? Sweety? The one I've been dreaming of day and night. She is like the Lin Chi-ling of Ji'an. Massage my ears for the sensation of hearing! The same kind of night, but a different mood. This program is sponsored by the biggest grocery chain store Bonjavi. Bonjavi: It's lonely being the best. I'm Sweety. I'll be right back after the break. Now the floor is yours. Don't worry. We are all set. We are all set. Cherish the time with Sweety. Hey, buddy. You can do it! Sweety's giving you a massage. Just listen to Sweety. If this goes public, wow, it's going to... Oh god. What's in your head? Look at yourself! Still eating and drinking? Aren't you afraid of getting tetanus? You two... You're total assholes! I just need to make one phone call, and my buddies will rush to the broadcasting station. Only one phone call! Boss Fortune, calm down. Your father-in-law told us to keep a low profile. So, there must be more tactful ways. Tactful? How many bowls have you had? Come on, eat it! Taste it. Hello, are you the police? Hi. I'm a taxi driver. I picked up some passengers and took them to the broadcasting station. I faintly heard them - saying something like... - Today in Sweety's studio... - ...they were gonna blow up the station. - We have our guests, Sewing Machine! Could you please introduce yourselves? Well, I... I... That... Hello, everyone, My name is Ding Jianguo. I'm the bassist. Hello. Hello, everyone, I'm the drummer of Sewing Machine... - Sweety, there's danger! - My name is Explo... A bomb? Oh, my god! Sweety, I'm not a bomb. I'm Explosive. Freeze! He's got a bomb! Hey! What are you doing? What the hell! THREE WORDS THEN I LOVE LILI Dr. Yang, your pose is so out of date! Come on! Be more of a rocker! Please deliver my apology to your colleague. We received an anonymous tip. So we were taking extreme measures. Sorry about that. Sorry for the trouble. You can take a photo first. Come on. I'll take one. Just imagine a smile, the sun shining, and the beach. I'm okay. Don't worry about me. Who cares about you? All we want to know about is Lili. Lili. Lili, she's a tattoo artist. The first time I met her I fell deeply in love. This pattern, right? Nope. I suddenly want to change it. What's your name? I'm Lili. Three words then... "I love Lili." It's brilliant! It's impressive! Can I ask you something? Shoot. Who is this Jixiang? She's my mom. But that's not important. The most important thing is I had a crazy crush on Lili. When I was ready to chase her... she disappeared. I didn't know how to contact her. And I didn't know any of her friends. But I was sure she had to be from Ji'an. So, I came here to look for her. Do you know why I wanted to join the band? It's because I want to sing at every place in Ji'an so that she can see me. Do you know why I drum facing my back? I don't want others to fall in love with me because I'm so handsome. I do all these things for Lili only. Listen. If you drum facing backward, how can Lili see you? Yeah how? How? How? How? Master, I heard you're in love with a girl named Lili, right? What a coincidence... My dog is also called Lili. Shut up! Beat harder! You didn't eat? No. I've been beating for 6 hours. What's wrong, Xixi? I can't find my hairpin. Well where did you go play? In the backyard. Let's go. Let's find it together. Stop crying. Let's go. It wouldn't just disappear. Come on. Wipe the tears. Wipe the tears. Come. This is the safest place. Someone is upstairs. I want to hear it. Should we lock the door? You're so cautious! Why did they lock the door on this dark and windy night? I have no idea. Locked! What are you talking about? - Don't think too much. - It makes me nervous. Hurry up. Open it. I want to see. What's your hurry? Shouldn't we wash our hands first? - Wash? - Save it. Hurry up. - Hold on. I'll unbuckle it first. - Don't over think it. Listen. Jianguo is a good girl. Are you ready? Wow! What do you think? Isn't it powerful? What? It looks nice. Hey, be gentle! You might scratch it with your long nails. It's not a big deal. I've touched it before. I've secretly touched it several times last time when we rehearsed. Several times? Well, anyway! You have no idea how many rock-loving girls in Ji'an want to touch it. You've already touched it. And you pretend like it's nothing! By the way, Cheng Gong wants to see it too. I'll call him here. The three of us. Three? - Calm down! - Good! Enjoying happiness alone is not as happy as sharing it. Us three can take a series of photos to remember. Don't touch it yourself! - Calm down! - Fine. You sick bastard! Take a photo? It's broken. Boss Fortune! Calm down! Let me go! - Let me go! - Just keep calm, boss. Give me the phone. I have to call my buddies. No! We'll be doomed if we expose ourselves. Stop yelling! Get his legs. Boss Fortune! It's probably a misunderstanding! Yes. If they were doing that they'd at least draw the curtains. How do I look? Stop. Let's get wild! Oh, no. Boss Fortune! Jianguo! Jianguo! Jianguo! Ouch! He might have fallen down the hole. Where did you put the detectaphone? Here. In this room. Can you do it? Sure thing. I thought they went to the school to perform. Me too. What the hell! Sick bastard! I can't get in touch with Hu Liang. You sing. Me? Yep. You can try too. You can do this. Coming! Buddy, this here... Sis, do me a favor. I need to go, bad. What's the rush? You're brother-in-law is still here. Now let's welcome our local band - Sewing Machine to perform their show. Let's give them a big applause. Nice! LILI Students of Ji'an No. 7 middle school, thanks for your support! Yeah! Teachers and students, we have a little situation up here. What I want to say is you can take photos, but please do not post them on Microblog or WeChat. You don't have to worry about that. You don't have to worry about that. Ji'an No.7 Middle School is a provincial key middle school. It's prohibited for students to bring their phones to school. Am I right? Yes! Thank you! Next program. Get up and let's go. Sewing Machine's performance flooded the city's social media. It's getting closer to September 30th, the date fo their performance. Are they going to make a miracle? I really can't wait! Stop aiming at me! Stop wasting water. Xixi! I'll bill your father. Come here! I have some good news for you guys. The municipal government will hold a party tomorrow night. And we are invited to perform! You mean I can meet the city leaders? Does that mean... the Rock'n'roll Park... will be spared? It depends on you. I remember the night Broken Guitar came to perform. Everyone in Ji'an went, except me. I didn't expect that after 20 years I'd be here with you all. Hu Liang, if you keep practicing the guitar the next few years, it's very possible you'll be the next me. The next you? It's not going to happen! Because I won't have cerebral thrombosis. Is Dr. Yang all right? He's all right. He only drank 22 bottles. He looks happy today. Do you want to play? I can't. Come on. Are you Cheng Gong? Yes. I'm Jianguo's father. I've heard what you've done. What... we've done? Jianguo barely talks to me. I know this from a friend who works in the government. Well, if you don't mind me asking... How would the government know about it? You're a young man from a big city after all. I really admire you. Uncle, I don't know much about the customs of Ji'an. Does this mean you are offering me money or I need to make a deposit? You're so amusing. There's a lucky number credit limit. 666,000 yuan. The performance tonight held by the municipal government... Why don't you just cancel it? The land under the Grand Guitar is really important to me. Mr. Ding, it's everyone's dream to pursue music. it's everyone's dream to pursue music. I can't just sell it like this. Dreams, huh? Look. ROCK NEVER DIES I also dreamed of being a rocker for many years. What's the use? The old guys from Broken Guitar. Now... is there anyone who actually remembers them? They're all tragedies. Compare them to how I am now. What's the point of realizing your dreams? But the "never" in your tattoo is only half-removed. You just can't let it go right? You youngsters, always hanging onto feelings with such nostalgia. I wanted to remove it completely. But I couldn't stand the pain. So, half is still left. That year when the Grand Guitar was built, I bought some steamed buns and brought along my guitar to give my regards to the construction workers. But one day, the doctor told me Jianguo's mother was ill. She needed a kidney transplant. What could I do? Wander the streets and play rock music for a while to ask someone for a kidney? Later, I understood that money can save lives. But dreams cannot. Let Jianguo take her position as Vice President. Son, don't be so hard on yourself. I'll give you another 500,000 yuan. Well, bro, just... fight for it again? It would be okay even if we sang half of it. I've tried. The staff in the government told me the program is too long. That's it. It can't be like this. What happened? Why are we here in the middle of the night? Hu Liang? He works every night because he said he still owes you money. The money my father gave you. It was a lucky number, huh? It looks like I should go and thank the gods for letting me meet another piece of shit. OLD SUN Hello. Why did they remove it? Why did they remove it? Bro! Bro, they pulled it down! The Grand Guitar is gone! It's gone! Bro! Stop it! Don't smash it! Why are you smashing it? What did it ever do to you! You're all bad guys! You bastards! You bastards! What did it ever do wrong! Hu Liang! Stop smashing it! They are all bastards! No, they are not! They are just workers! They pulled down the Grand Guitar! So, they are the bad guys! They're not the bastards! I'm the bad guy! What did you say? I'm the bad guy! I accepted money from the property developer! I cancelled our show! Hu Liang! What are you doing? Stop fighting! Let him go! Punch me! LOOKING FOR LILI Dad. I know. Get rid of them. I WANT YOU. JOIN MY BAND. So you three are going abroad to become traffic lights? Sir. We're going abroad to be stars. Star! Green light, I think you'll definitely be the most famous one. I love green lights... Because I don't want to be stuck here. SEWING MACHINE IN CONCERT: SEPTEMBER 30TH JI'AN ROCK'N'ROLL PARK: THE PERFECT GOODBYE This is it. 4,919 yuan. ROCK'N'ROLL HAS DIED You sick bastard! Sick bastard! Damn you! You sick bastard! Want to steal? I just bought them and you came here to steal! I just bought them and you came here to steal! You like underpants, huh? Here you are! Come on! I want to see your face! Hu Liang, I'm sorry. Bro, it's over. I finally understand. Whether they removed Grand Guitar or not... It wasn't up to us... It was my fault. I was too young. I want to finish our performance at the same location and time. Are you in? I don't want to sing anymore. I mean I can still sing. But I don't know what for? The Grand Guitar is gone. What I want to do is repair vehicles. Listen to me. You can still do the repairing. But you still need to sing. Otherwise, you'll lose the spirit in your heart. I had that kind of spirit before. Back then the only thing I thought about was when I could start each day. But now, I've lost it in my heart. Now I only think about when I can end each day. At the time when my heart was in it, your bro was a real rocker! But without that spirit, my head is only full of this stuff! But you can't be like this. As long as we keep singing, the Grand Guitar will still be here. Otherwise, it's gone forever. Are you in? Yeah. I can't hear you. Are you in? I'm in. Louder! Are you in?! I'm in! Are you in?! I'm in! Are you in?! I'm in! - I'm damn in! - I'm in! Xixi, come down! I've seen your videos. You don't need to climb out the window anymore. Use the front door. Mom... wear this on the stage. There's a demonstration match at the taekwondo gymnasium. I'm going to see your show after that. Is that okay? Okay. Li Meiyan! Li Meiyan, listen. Xixi must go to the show today! - Dad... - Don't say anything, honey. Just remember what your dad has done for you today! This is the credit card you've been looking for. That's all? Women are greedy! What are you guys looking at? Nervous? Well... It's quite normal. Our band was established just a month ago. Now, you're performing at a big show. You're not the only one. We're all nervous. Right? Yep! Three of a kind! Get out! Share the money with our brothers. Bro, leave the dirty work to us. You can stay inside because you're still injured. No. I need to beat the two assholes who humiliated Jianguo myself. Get out! Stay inside! I'm out! What do you want? I'm out! Stop screaming! I'm out! What do you want? Hold your tongue! Shut up! Pay attention! Listen to me! My respected gangsters, I understand why you'd want to hijack a cash truck. But why are you hijacking a fire truck? Your water supply was cut off? Just save it. I know who you are, horse-face guy. Who am I then? You're my neighbor. I have nothing to do with your fat wife! It's the truth. What fat wife? I knocked on their door without any clothes on last time. That yellow dress belongs to her. Are you cheating again? Beat him! Lock the door! That way! Where's the water? Go! WE LOVE PEACE Don't move! The horse-face man is our hostage! I'll extinguish him if you get closer! Don't move! Step back! It's stuck in my mouth! Step aside! You go first! Go! Let's go. Let's go. Let's get out of here. I want to see who you really are. Run! Dad. Mom. Run! Today is September 30th. Sewing Machine will perform their song on the debris at the Rock'n'roll Park. Remember who you are, rockers... Are you guys going cheer them on alongside Sweety? You guys are here. All set? Yes. Everything is ready. Your arm, master... I'm okay. Listen to me. Everything we've been preparing is for this very moment. The Grand Guitar is gone. Let's pay our tribute. Come on! Let's rock'n'roll! Sewing Machine! One day, I'll start my own band, and roar out songs for my hometown! - Let's rock'n'roll, Sewing Machine! - Fashionable long johns. All for free! Go! - Xixi! - Jianguo! Jianguo! - Jianguo! - Grandpa! Sewing Machine! Sewing Machine! Sewing Machine! Today, being able to stand on this stage is all thanks to one person. He's our agent, Cheng Gong. Bro, I am not smart enough to know what your dream is. But today, I want you to get on stage and sing a song. We people of Ji'an are all musicians. Today, we're going to accompany him, all right? Okay! No more hesitation! Come on! Come on! to lead me to my dreams> to lead me to my dreams> My hometown is a beautiful town called Ji'an. It's quiet and ordinary. But, because of this band dramatic changes took place here. Bro, if you ever find the time, come back to visit us! OK. Make a pinky promise! I gotta go. Don't be sentimental! What are you looking at? Give me a hand. You are heading to Beijing? So what? I can't be a drifter in Beijing? Do I need your permission or what? From then on, this beautiful town of rock'n'roll has been full of hope, vitality, and love. Let's rock'n'roll! Ji'an! A special thanks to...

It was your fault insisting on taking photos with the audience. We could've been here earlier to have our own celebration party. I didn't! Old Yang here was taking photos with a group of women! I was only acting. You were looking for your next wife, huh? Explosive! Lili! Lili? Tongtong! Tongtong? Dad? Dad? This is my daughter Tongtong. She just came back from abroad. Come on. It's your turn now. What's your name? I LOVE JIXIANG I'm Lili. Three words then... "I love Lili." Either dance, or get lost and don't come back! Who the hell would wanna come back! Is Cheng Gong here? Hey there, instructor! Is this where I'll be teaching dance? Bro, do you like this car? At least there's a view. The looks and performance are better than normal cars. Can you go any faster? So impatient. Hang on...! Here I come! - Is this egg pancake? - Yes. How much? 6, please. Be careful. It's hot. Thank you. Darling, look at that giant guitar. Is that wonderful? Yeah! That's so cool!
