Previously on "seeking sister wife"... Okay, keep the kids out from underneath in case I accidentally drop the sign or something, or myself. We are officially courting another potential sister wife. We met Jennifer online, and she lives up by Niagara Falls. Maybe we could, you know, meet with you. [ Screams ] Bernie: Paige and I have been married for going on 16 years now. But we are looking to add a sister wife. Bernie: I know last time we were courting, you got a little jealous. Paige: I do really want to live this lifestyle, but watching my children get close to another woman could possibly be very hard for me to do. That's Sophie. Both of our communities, polygamy is frowned upon. But I want to claim my husband out in the community and not having our relationship confined to my home. I don't have to be a closet wife. I have to find an opportunity for our family to be out in the public and show people who we are. It's a small town. News travels fast. This is a big deal. Mm-hmm. We have a girlfriend. Her name is Vanessa. She's from Seattle. And she's 34. She's never been married. She doesn't have any children. Hi. But it will be her first time meeting the babies. And it will also be her first time staying at our house. Getting excited about getting here. I want to make sure that I don't do a thing that could [bleep] this up. captions paid for by discovery communications ♪♪ -She's here. Wow. -I know. Vanessa: [ Laughs ] I'm back. So, good flight? Vanessa: Good flight. Good food. Had a nice little nap, and yeah. Just, it's good. Ashley: Yeah, well, you're here. -I know. -And it's real. -Yeah. -It's real. Ashley: Vanessa's visiting us here in Atlanta for her second time. This could be the determining factor whether it makes or breaks the relationship because if we don't gel as a family, then that's a big deal, and we would love for this to be, like -- mm-hmm. But, you know, we just don't know, so now we're getting ready to find out. Vanessa: Can I hold little nari now? Oh, it's nice to see you. -Whoa. -Hi. Hi, angel. You're so sweet. Yeah, this feels good. Ashley: I am blown away by the baby's reception of Vanessa. She doesn't always take to new people very quickly, so this is definitely a great sign. But we still have to get to know Vanessa better before we can say she's actually the one. -Wow. -I know. It's just different because we don't -- like, we typically abstain from, you know, introducing our children, or we wait. -Wait a little bit. -Yeah. -Okay. -Right. Do you need anything? Would you like something to drink, or -- some water would be wonderful. -Okay. -I'm a little parched. Yeah. Vanessa: All my friends and family know that I am here pursuing a plural relationship, and people were pretty supportive for the most part, but I know behind my back that they're all thinking and saying, what is she doing? Has she lost her mind? But in the meantime, I want to make sure that everything goes smoothly with Dimitri and Ashley. Dimitri: So, obviously, you weren't a polygamist before now. -No. -Or even thinking about it. No. What the hell makes this different? What is it -- I'm still curious about that. Why is this okay? [ Laughing ] I mean, that's a great question. I am a big advocate for people doing whatever it is that they want to do. Living their life however they want to do as long as it's authentic, and they're not hurting anybody, and they're happy, you know. And I love men. But when I live with my female friends, it's so fun, you know. I was beginning to think the guy I settled down with is gonna have to be really freakin' cool to compete with how much fun I have living with my girlfriends. So, it never occurred to me that I could have an awesome best friend to share motherhood, sisterhood with, and have potentially a beautiful, amazing husband, too, you know. Baby, you play me. Play me as you want. I felt like things are going really well with Vanessa. I think so, too. I mean, there's a lot of good chemistry between Vanessa and I and the family. Definitely. I mean, she already knows what went down with Joselyn last year. I'm, like, mesmerized by you right now. [ Giggles ] Did anything happen? We -- yeah, we were intimate. We were intimate. Okay. So, I think it's important for us to kind of get clear with Vanessa on what our ground rules are. Right. So that we can move forward and have a very nice, seamless transition. Absolutely. You know, we have experienced dating before, and for us, I think it's gonna be very important that when it comes to intimacy that we are all in agreement that this is a good time and space. Like, we're all comfortable with where things are going before we engage. And I mean, before you guys engage. Oh, yeah. Of course. To be clear. -To be clear. -You're my sister. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Vanessa is too important to this family for me to risk being with her, and I don't want to mess it up. But yeah, there's temptation, of course. I mean, this woman is in my home. We're sharing a space. So, at the end of the day, still gonna be hiding. Though only you and I are going to be intimate. My relationship with you, my friendship, sisterhood, is just as important to me. Yeah. We're choosing to be a family. We're choosing -- -together. Yeah. Whatever happens from this point on, like, we're in it together. And then when you guys are feeling froggy, check in to make sure this is still what we're all choosing. -Sure. -Yes. It sounds like we're all on the same page as far as intimacy and sisterhood and family wherever it goes. But everyone is typically on their best behavior when you first kind of interact. And you know, we've been here before, and we didn't give enough time towards building a relationship. So it'll be interesting to see how things play out. Well, I'm good. You good? I'm good. You good? -[ Laughs ] I'm good. -We know you're good. You better be good, you lucky dog. I am very good. I am very, very good. ♪♪ Got some food. -Yay. -Yay. Who ordered the monkey? -I like monkeys. -Monkey for the monkey? -Cinnamon rolls. -Thank you. And cookies. We've been looking for a sister wife now off and on for about five years. Bernie: But our house burned down last year, and it really threw a monkey wrench on plans. We had to start over from everything, so we took some time off from dating. But now we're ready. [ Laughs ] So how are you feeling, Kyle? Good. Especially now that I got some food. -So your allergies are okay? -Yes, ma'am. Bernie and I want to talk to the boys about pursuing a sister wife again, but I'm a little nervous to see how they're gonna react. In the past when we've courted and it didn't work out, the boys were very much heartbroken, just as we were, so I do have worries about them getting hurt again. -It's honey. -It's honey. What's all that gross stuff? John: It's honey and peanut butter and banana on toast. Bernie: Oh, that's good. So, today is our sabbath. What do you feel about the fact that we're not at the synagogue right now? I'm just kind of really upset how everything happened. Me, too. We went to a local congregation for about three years. Loved those people to death. Paige: We were very open and honest with them that we were polygamists, and that we were looking into plural marriage. We were very much welcome with it at first, and then recently, they got together. Called in a special meeting, had the whole congregation there on a Sunday. And big trial, and asked us to leave. Said if we wanted to repent of our sin, then we could come back. That is not gonna happen. Let me ask y'all something. [ Indistinct conversations ] We've been open and honest with you guys. We think it's time to go ahead and start looking again for a new sister wife. Are you okay with us starting again? Because dad and I are ready. How do you feel about that? Johnny, I know it's kind of hard on you. I'm fine with anything. John's normally a very honest, open boy, but sometimes he'll kind of hold back to keep from hurting people's feelings. So I am a little scared that John may be not telling me exactly how he fully feels about it, which I hope that's not the case. Do you think if you told a couple of your other friends, do you think your friends would still be your friends and would handle it okay? Some of them, maybe, more than one. One of my biggest concerns with searching again for a sister wife with the boys, them getting ostracized or losing friends because it's happened before. Have you told any of your friends that we are polygamists? Just the one friend? She doesn't agree with it, but she's not gonna ignore somebody because they believe something different. I do worry sometimes about how people will react to me telling them this, but I mean, it's maybe kinda weird. It's -- I don't view it as bad. Are y'all excited about the potential of having a second mom, a second person married to your dad? I wouldn't really call her a mom, per se, but -- we're excited, but -- -you're not? -Hold up. Let's -- let's start over. You're not excited? That's not what I said at all. I said I don't really think that would be called a mom, per se. I don't really know. Oh. I misunderstood what you said. In a plural relationship, children are very much just as involved as the parents, and that is my big concern. I want to make sure that my children are protected and taken care of. I know none of this has been easy on y'all. I love you boys. I'll do anything I can. ♪♪ So I notice that you guys eat mostly a plant-based diet. I am not a vegetarian or a vegan. I like a steak and burger. No pork or beef. We don't cook it. We don't buy it. I don't know if that's gonna be a problem for you. Jeff: I never really thought that I would be coming to Niagara Falls. -To meet somebody. -To meet somebody. It really wasn't too long ago that we were waiting for somebody to come visit us that we had met. The wait part is nerve-wracking. Which means if she doesn't show up, it'll be that much harder. -Yes. -[ Laughs ] ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh ♪ ♪ oh whoa, whoa, whoa ♪ Tami: Broccoli's good. Hooray. You're gonna eat it? Hey, you! [ Gasps ] Who's here? Baby, who's here? Yay. Colton: My two wives live in two separate homes and two separate towns, and I split my time between them every other night, and last night was my night to spend with Sophie. We've come over today to tami's house to spend some time all together as a family. Are you sure? I can. I'm gonna get you. Ahh! [ Laughter ] That was exciting. Sadie's 3rd birthday is coming up, and last year, we met Sophie on social media and married her a few months later. And so, we're still learning about each other as a plural family, but she is a second mom to Sadie. So, we think it's really important that Sophie is involved not only in the party itself, but also in planning it. Should we have a birthday party? -Yeah. -Yeah. What are we gonna do for her birthday party? That would be fun. [ Laughs ] I've kind of been thinking that we really haven't had any opportunities to go out in public as a family very much. I think maybe Sadie's birthday would be a good opportunity to do that. Even though we're new in our plural family, we're ready to take on another sister wife. But we still have not introduced Sophie to the community as my second wife. And that's mainly because plural marriage is frowned on in Southern Utah. I know that it's been really hard for Sophie because she's felt like a closet wife. Ultimately, that's been hard for me, as well, and for all of us. It's nerve-wracking 'cause we have been private for so long. Polygamy is illegal in Utah, so what that means is that the legal wife would not be prosecuted, but both the husband of a plural family and the plural wives are at risk for prosecution, and that's a very real fear for us. So, what do you two think about making Sadie's birthday sort of our first public outing together? I definitely think it's time to just, like, rip off the band-aid. I think that it'll be, like, freeing. That we can just be who we are and do what we're doing. We're celebrating Sadie's birthday, and it'll be good. It's definitely sucky being a plural wife and feeling like you have to be a closet wife. We have not gone out in the public at all. -Not as a family. -Not as a family. I mean, we've never gone to the movie or gone out to eat or anything. All of the time that we've spent together is just in our homes, and I love being a part of this family, and I think that what we have is really great, and I don't want to hide it anymore. I've kind of gotten to the point where I'm tired of being stressed about it. Yeah. I just want it to be the way it is. Yeah. I know that before we can add another wife to the family, we need to go public with Sophie first, but by nature, I am a very introverted person, and this is definitely out of my comfort zone, and it makes me really nervous. I think we've lived with enough stress the last year. Yeah, definitely. At least we're getting out of the house. For Sadie's party, we are going to go to the park, just the four of us, and we're really crowded where everybody can see us. And I think it'll be the perfect location for us to come out as a plural family. It's something that we have to do. Are you sure you want to have your party at a playground and not at the farm? [ Laughter ] -Okay. -Okay. Daddy's just teasing you, honey. Daddy's just teasing you. [ Laughter ] I love it when she gets in that voice. ♪♪ Okay, guys. [ Grunts ] Hey, bud. Gonna miss you, son. For a couple months now, we've been courting this woman named Jennifer. I get along with her great. Vanessa gets along with her great, and Jeff gets along with her great, and the kids really like her. You want to say hi? -Hi. She's really fun, bubbly, energetic person. And it looks like she could potentially be a really good fit for our family. Things have been going so well that we finally asked her to meet us in person. We were hoping to find a time and a place where maybe we could meet with you. Whoa. You are stronger than you know, little pumpkin. Jennifer lives up by Niagara Falls, and she's a nail technician by day, and a bartender at night. Yep. Mama's gonna go bye bye in the blue car. So, it's hard for her to get off time to visit with us. So we're gonna take the trip out to her and go see her. Bye, baby. I love you. We've got some friends of ours coming and staying at our home. They'll watch the kids while we're in niagara. So, here we go, off to the airport. Here, wait. Daddy gets a hug goodbye. We have all these emotions going on. Yeah. We're leaving our children for the first time, ever, and we're going to meet somebody we've never met before. You guys gonna try and stow away? I don't think you'll get very far. You get all those butterflies, and you wonder, is this gonna work? Is it not gonna work? Is she person I think she is? It can be a risk, and that's a big deal. -Wave. -Want to blow kisses? I love you. Bye bye. Vanessa: Getting this chance to meet Jennifer makes the relationship so much more real and more scary because if it works out, gosh, we might have a new sister wife. It's a big deal. Sharis: This is the make it or break it time. We're gonna see what direction this relationship is gonna head in. Even though we've been burned in the past, I think we're all looking forward to this meeting with Jennifer, and we're hopeful that it's gonna work out. But you never know. -Bye bye. -Bye, guys. Love you! How do you feel about me talking to another woman again? It's really important that I know that John's with us. But if everybody else is pushing for it, and just one person says no, then what is that person supposed to change? ♪♪ Ashley: All right, so you're gonna have to give me help 'cause I know about poke. Don't worry. I'll set you up. Woman: Hi, welcome to poke Hawaiian. -Hi. -Hi. In a polygamist family, it's very important for the husband and the wife to have a very strong connection and bond, but it's as equally important as the sister wives to have a strong bond, as well. And we've not had the best of luck finding someone who truly values me as a sister wife. As was the case when Joselyn slept with Dimitri ahead of schedule. So what else happened on the date? Umm -- we had some really good food. The fried rice was really good. I gave her quite a few opportunities to say something, and she didn't. At this point, I don't feel like she has enough respect for me as a person. So I'm really hoping that Vanessa is someone that I can trust as a sister wife. First, a toast to sisterhood. -Cheers. -Salut. Do you want some wasabi? Yes, I'll take a little bit. So, how are you feeling being here, meeting the babies? Well, it was wonderful to meet them. I think they were excited. I think they liked me, but then they were, like, "okay." -we're done. We'll see ya. No, they're so cute. Vanessa: I'm really excited that Ashley and I get to know each other better, but I am new to this lifestyle, new to their family at this point. I'm really curious to see what her expectations are for a potential sister wife coming in to the family. What is she looking for? What are her boundaries she wants to set? So, I have a lot of questions. So, I notice that you guys eat very healthily, and mostly plant-based diet, right? Yeah. If we had to put a label on it, we'd be closest to pescatarian, but we don't consume dairy. So, if I were to come and join the family, would the expectation be that -- 'cause right now, I eat -- I like a steak and burger for dinner. Yeah. Yeah. So, what would that look like? Umm -- Dimitri is very adamant about no pork or beef. We don't cook it. We don't buy it. We don't eat it when we go out, like, none of that stuff. So, I don't know if that's gonna be a problem for you. I am not a vegetarian or vegan, but I hope that there's a bit of wiggle room if I do want a steak or cheeseburger every once in a while, so we'll have to see about that. That might be interesting. We'll see. How do you feel about that? Would you be able to adapt to that type of -- yeah, I mean, I'm a very adaptable person. I'm always trying to eat healthy. I'm a pisces, so I will try to get away with whatever I can. So if I'm left to my own devices, like I said, I'll eat pizza every night and burgers and stuff. Wow. If I'm left to my own devices, I might eat cupcakes for the rest of my life, so. Ashley: Vanessa seems like a fun person, but if I have any concern, it would be the diet. She really enjoys the way that she has been eating. But it's something that we take very seriously. So, we just really have to kind of work through and understand better to know if, at the end of the day, this is going to be a viable relationship. Thanks for this lovely lunch. You bought it, honey. Thank you. Thanks for coming with me. I'm teasing. I really like Vanessa, but she's never been in a polygamist relationship before, and I'm not really sure she understands what that entails. Dimitri and Vanessa have their solo date coming up, and I hope that goes great without any setbacks, but it'll be a trust test because if they don't connect, this relationship's gonna be over before it even gets started. Thank you for bringing me. I've had poke before, so -- -oh. I'm glad you like it maybe I'll whip it up for us one day at home if I come home. Hey. Cheers to that. Cheers to that. [ Laughing ] ♪♪ Bernie: Paige and I took our sons out to lunch one day to tell them that we are searching for a second wife again. Can't stress how important it is that we're all in the same accord. Whether that be in our faith, courting, moving forward. We are family. We have to move as one unit, so it's really important that I know that John's with us. Bernie: Tell you what. Let's go take a walk down there by the water. He might be holding some things in. I'm just hoping he trusts me enough to talk to me about 'em. So, what'd you need? Just want to chit-chat with you for a little bit. About what? [ Whispers ] About a lot of things. [ Normal voice ] Please don't do this thing where you bottle it up and shell it up. Talk to me, son.

[ Sighs ] How do you feel about me talking to another woman again? I guess, you know, okay. What if everybody else is pushing for it, and just one person says no, then what is that person supposed to change? Oh. That's a pretty deep question. I don't really know how to answer that. But you've never really pushed against it before. I never do. No, and you never do. I'm saying it doesn't really matter, so. I'm being as honest as I can be now. What questions do you have about it? How many wives would you want? You know, how many is too many? How many is enough? I think three is a real good number. I think three, I can balance time better. Yeah, how would you do that, though? Balance time? Yeah. Well, I'm gonna have to have to sleep at night, right? Right now, I sleep at night in the same bed with your mother. If I have two wives, I'll have to rotate nights between them. What? You know, everybody has their own room, definitely has their own room. What were you meaning? I was meaning, like, you -- never mind. I don't think you got at all what I was talking about. I guess I didn't. If you'd expunge on it a little bit, I would probably get it. So we have, like, one house or something? We all are still together, intermingled? Yes, definitely. But you -- what are you talking about, spending different days -- might be a little bit too much information for you. [ Sighs ] Anyways. Your mother and I, we care a lot about you and Kyle. Y'all are my world. I want to do this because I want a big family. I want a strong family. It was good to have a heart-to-heart with John. I never really had to do before when he was younger. It's kind of awkward now that he's a little older. I hate to see him hurt or confused. I'm just gonna have to handle it with care. All right, we're going forward from here, and if questions and concerns do arise, just talk to me. Deal? Deal. Deal. You can do better than that. There we go. Deal. How are you feeling? Um...

Do we want to do just, like, picnic at the park? Really just kind of casual? Yeah, I'd prefer a more casual setting and not in a restaurant where there's so many people, and it's hard to hear. I'd like to be out in the open and just take it easy. It's kind of romantic, being right there by the falls. Maybe she'll "fall" for us. So anyway, well, why don't we go get settled in my room?

We know that it's going to rock the boat, but it's something that we just have to do because ultimately, we don't want to feel like we've got to live our lives in the shadows, and we don't want to bring another life into the family if she's going to have to feel that way. -All right. -Do you want to take two trips?

I mean, granted, there's not a lot of people here. Colton: We're ready to take on another wife. So, it's discouraging thought. We really didn't get to accomplish our goal of being out in the public and trying to be open about our family. -Okay, ready? -Yeah. Sophie: It's disappointing because it's a little hard to try and claim my sister wife and my husband and my daughter if nobody's there to witness it. And I don't think we'll even be ready to court a third wife until we are able to overcome this hurdle. I hope that god will give us the faith and the strength we need to make that happen. Has this been a fun little party? -Yeah! -Yeah? ♪♪ Jeff: Man, that's beautiful. I never really thought that I would be coming to Niagara Falls. -To meet somebody. -To meet somebody. We're finally in Niagara Falls. We flew across the country for the first time, and now we're meeting Jennifer for the first time. We're really excited, but it's just a lot to take in. I can't believe we're right here. To find Jennifer this far away from us, and to think that it might be a fit, you know. To come all this way just to meet. It's pretty crazy, actually. It is. It is very crazy. I never would have pictured it. Vanessa: Last year, I was just in a different head space because of my pregnancy. But this year, I'm feeling much more present in the relationship. But I'm also nervous to see how it plays out because the last time we were in a courtship with malena, and she didn't show up at the airport. That was really hard for us because, you know, who wants to feel that rejection? So waiting for Jennifer to show up, it brings up similar feelings, like, will she show up? I guess we're gonna find out. [ Bell dinging ] [ Bird chirping ] It's nerve-wracking. -It is nerve-wracking. The waiting part is nerve-wracking. I wish I could skip this part and just jump right into the middle, you know? Yeah. You know, it really wasn't too long ago that we were kind of sitting in an airport, waiting for somebody to come visit us that we had met. I think this time's gonna be a lot different with Jennifer. I think she's gonna show up. Sharis: Yeah. I think so, too. I think so, too. Which means if she doesn't show up, it'll be that much harder. Yeah. Car just pulled up over there, and I'm wondering if that's her. [ Bell dinging ] Not yet. Too tall. I guess that raises the question, how long would we wait? I don't know. [ Laughing ] I don't know, either. Vanessa: I think rejection is always hard, so if it happens again, you know, I don't want that. Jeff: We can only handle so much rejection. ♪♪ Next on "seeking sister wife"... I will have the butcher's cut. Yeah. -Are you serious? I'm getting ready to fall out of my chair. In our home, we don't eat any red meat. It's almost like a violation. This is painful. Mm-mm! [ Laughs ] Kyle: Is it crowded in there? Dude, you see me? I can't move. We're back in the hunt for a second wife. Kind of hard to bring one home to a camper. It makes intimacy a little bit harder. Look, guys. I found a rental house that I really like, and it is perfect for us. I do not want to share a room. Sophie: We're at the farmer's market, and we are going to try again to come out into public together as a plural family. Colton: Polygamy is against the law in this state, so we really have no idea how people are going to respond to us. I'm actually my husband's second wife.
