He's gonna storm in there, boots ablazing and lasers in every ass, total totalitarian terror. You get the picture. - For what purpose I might ask. - He knows about the new gal. He doesn't agree with y'all's religion it might seem. - That'll be all. 5000 Buddha bites have been transferred to your account. - I was also hoping I could join the festivities. Aren't I eligible for an official invite? - Fine, but not in whatever attire you must be wearing. I'll have something tailored for you.

I gave you a rare elixir instead, for the bite, so you'd only be lowered to our state temporarily. You're all better now, back to human. - But you. - I also ingested some. I was tired of being Gargoya's chambermaid. And besides, I became kind of fond of you, the only man brave enough to stand up to him. - That little oval animal, it was yours all along. Newton. - I'm sorry, he didn't make it, but his 1 million children are doing quite well. (gentle vocal music) (lips smacking) - But how are we going to survive? What can we possibly eat out here? - I know of a reserve with liquid protein. - Lead the way. - Ugh, curse my innocent clone! (buttons clicking) (phone ringing) You let him escape! - Your detention center's flawed. Are you sure you let your crystal ball charge up properly in last night's full moon? - Ugh, it's all my favorite slave's fault. - You're better off without her. She's crossed over into a pitiful lady person. She's not gonna live past 90. (laughs) - But you, you have irritated me beyond reason. Stifling my every chain of command. Your brilliant plan was the opposite of that. - I didn't really have a plan. - Now he's back out there. It's the end of the vein, Lippy. Your bloodline is mine. - Please, don't ruin my fish farm again. - Ha, the very idea, I would never. We're just gonna use your DNA to bring a new reign of terror, pygmies. Smaller is better, easier to feed. (speaking foreign language) And as for you, I will suppress your worldly soul and watch it wither beneath my feet forever. (phone clatters) Find him. (speaking foreign language) (owl hooting) - [Eon] Now we're sitting pretty. We need wheat treat. I love liquid protein. I just so happened to have the tool to open her up. Open her wide and let her pour. We're gonna be feeding off this baby for years. (dramatic music) Daddy's back.
