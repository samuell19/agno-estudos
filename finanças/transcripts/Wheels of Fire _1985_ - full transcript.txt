Trace! I see you still haven't changed your colours, huh? - How about you? - No complains. - Hey look, where can I find the nomads? - Over there. Thanks. Anytime you want to get back on the team, let me know. That'll be the day. That's the man himself. - Arlie! - Trace! What are you doing here anyway? I heard you picked up with this nomad bunch and I wanted to see how you were doing. We had an agreement, remember? Yeah kid, I remember. Hey what the hell is going on here anyway? Relax Bo, this is my brother. Trace, right? Yeah, Arlie's told me all about you. Real pleasure. - Ain't he a beauty? - Hey pretty boy! Anytime you're ready, huh? Excuse but, duty calls. That's for luck. Hey, how can I lose? They wrestle after car keys. What is the deal? Bo's got a bet he can take out that skinny punk. Oh yeah? What are the stakes? My car against the punk's car. Your car? Those are your keys? There's no way that punk can take them. Oh, shit! Who the hell is this? They pulled the switch! This dude's a ringer, Trace. He wasn't part of the deal! Trace! Do something! Great, now he's got the keys. Here, hold this. Go away! He's mine! Let's get moving Arlie, the show's over! Come on, kick it! Come on. Get up. Follow me! He's got the keys! What should I do? Watch out! Go! Just go! Okay. Split them up, Trace. What the fuck is he doing? He's gonna split the pack! Almost lost your ass, didn't you, Bo? What, you think so? You think they can get my ass? Yeah, if Trace wasn't there, you would've lost your ass. No shit. Kiss my sweet ass, punk face! Holy shit! What's he gonna pull now? Eat this! Oh, God! Pretty good, huh Trace? Well I taught you pretty good. I thought. Hey man, she was terrific. How does your ass look now? Hey fine, I show you mine if you show me yours. How much you got? I don't know. You think I'll like it? I guess it might grow on you. What is it, Trace? There. What do you see? Could be anything. It's coming this way, we better get moving. Looks like... yeah, it's Scourge. What do you think? Maybe we should split up. Leave two different trails. Not a bad idea. We stay together. Wait, I got it. Remember the waterhole we found last winter? 90 miles west of here, right? Yeah. We'll meet you there tomorrow morning! Yeah, sounds like a winner. No way, we're staying together! Come on, let's go. Come on! Wait for me in the car. Look Trace, I can take care of myself, okay? I can tell you don't like him. - I don't trust him. - You don't trust anybody! Come on Arlie, use your head! He's just after what he can get from you, kid. You didn't say anything about checking up on me or choosing my men for me. I'm tired of running through guys, trying to find one you like. Okay, we better get moving. You take the highway. I'll take the desert so they will follow my dust. I'll see you tomorrow, and then we'll talk. What's to talk about? Tomorrow, okay? What the hell's going on anyhow? Somehow I get the feeling I'm in competition with the asshole. Give me a break, he's my brother for Christ's sake. Yeah, who needs him anyways? Hey! You're wasting gas! Fuck you! Robot! Follow that one! - Scag, go get him! - Yeah, boss! Let's go! We got him where we wanted, let's go assholes! The scum belongs to me! Come on! Let's get him! Come on, man! Move out! Let's kick off! Hold it, Bo. I say, cut it out! I think I hear something! Oh, come on Arlie. Can't you hear that! I don't hear nothing! Anyways, your brother say they'll folow him, not us. Remember? Shut up Bo! I'm trying to listen! Goddammit Bo, get off of me! Oh shit! Get away from me! Hands off you stinking pigs! You fucking goons! You want the girl, take the girl! You want the car, take it! I'll tell you what, I'll join with you! You fucking bastard! Shut up, woman. Hey take it easy man! I'm on your side, guys. Put her down! Strip her! What's your hurry, Scag? Keep your pants on. Not a bad looking piece. Too good for you greaseball! I'm not dog food! I like this one, she has spirit. Take her to the camp. No mangling, understand? Come on, let's drag this bitch over here! What are you doing to me?! What about him, boss? Hey, let me join up with you, just give me a chance! I'll do anything! What do you say, boys? Looks like you're in. Provided you make it to the initiation. Initiation? You motherfucker! I want first. Wait! Let's take him for a jeep tour. What happened to Arlie? They got her. Who? Who got her? Scourge... Well, I'm gonna get her back. Oh God! Do something! Help me, please! Kill me! Let me go, you miserable faggots! You're not going anywhere. I hate your stinking guts! Let me have her, she makes you look bad. I'm going to make me turn you over to Scag. You want that?! Fuck off! You want it? You can have it. After I'm finished. Clean her up. The ownership convoy left this morning, headed to the outpost to the true believers. Scag, take a patrol out tonight and intercept that convoy. - And bring the cargo here, we could use it! - Yes, sir! Get off! Sure got a funny way of saying thank you. I'm taking your car. The keys? Inside. You are one of Scourge's man? Where is the son of a bitch? You're looking for Scourge? So am I! And since we're both after him, why don't we travel together? Just who the hell are you? They call me Stinger. It figures. So what do you say? I don't even like you very much. I like your bird. Get in. Why are you tracking Scourge? I'm a sort of a hunter. What kind of a hunter. Look, you haven't exactly been straight with me. You haven't told me a damn thing about yourself. Why should I? If that's the way you feel, we don't have to talk to each other at all. Fine by me. What are you gonna do?! Don't stop grandpa. I've got one shell left Spike, you go! I can't leave you here! Run Spike run! Don't stop! Grandpa? Hurry, before the see you! He can't be far! Hey! Go get him! Alright let's go! Where're you gonna bed down? Out there somewhere. Wanna come in here? Just 'cause we're travelling together... Doesn't mean we're sleeping together. Who the hell are they? They're sand men. They rob idiots like you who wander off the road. And eat them. How do you know all that? I can hear what they're thinking. Let's go! What's the matter sweetheart? You don't like my looks? Maybe as a corpse! You're beginning to piss me off. How do you want it? Rough? Or nice? You better take it easy. Alright. That's more like it. No! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go, you miserable jerk offs! You really shouldn't have done that. Just keep away from me, you fucking pervert! What's going on? I'm getting a headache. You can't shutdown now, tell me what they're thinking. Nevermind kid, don't tell me. I know what they're thinking. Get your paws off me! Let go you bastards! Let me go! Put me down, let me go! Well, was about fucking time! Back! Come on, let's get out of here, fast! Back off! Back off! Hold it a second. Look out! Keep going, this is really getting hot. Come on, ladies! How much further, little man? 25 miles? Hurra! What is it? Ownership convoy. Looks like it's been hit pretty hard. I'm gonna check it out. Get back! Back! Hey, get out! Stand up! Are you with the Ownership Army? They must be hard up for recruits. Trace, I don't like the look of this. Come on, get behind me. To the car. Get in the Mustang! I wonder what that's all about. His name is Mutt. He's a true believer. He was escorted in the Ownership Convoy when they were ambushed. He would like to know if you would take him there. How do you know all of this? He told me. You understand that signs language, right? Not really. So how do you know what he was saying? I can hear what he's thinking. We sure screwed up those turkeys! Hey asshole! - Cargo? - Gasoline, we sucked up a full tank. Not bad for a day's work. Looks like a wildcat got you, boss. She's a tame pussy now. - Finished with her? - Yeah... and I'm turning her over to you and the boys! Alright! She's mine motherfuckers! Harlan... what the hell are you doing here? I might ask you the same question. You can forget about that convoy you were waiting for to roll in. So Scourge strikes again... Welcome pilgrims! They call me Whiz, these are my true believers! Peace lovers, every last one of them. There's a happy face! This is a good place! People here have good thoughts! It's a good place! Everybody wants to come here. They want to help me built my rocketship. Look at it? You know we only got a couple more months to finish her, and then we got us a lift off! Things haven't been too pleasant in this planet. That's why we're flying off to paradise. That's the newest planet in our solar system. It was discovered after the war. And it's only 20 million miles away! And there's room for everybody! I'm glad we're here! I'm glad you're here too, Trace. Well, that's the Ambassador! I know who he is. He's a good man! He's gonna give us all the gas we need for our rocketship! Is that a fact? - Yeah, boss? - Get the men ready to move out. - We're attacking at dawn tomorrow. - Who are we going to hit? - True believers. - Motorship clowns? Precisely. Let's go! Get onboard! I've been set out here to enlist the support of emerging nations like this. Emerging nations, my ass! That's a goddamn cracker factory! And you're just using these people to further your own cause and you know it! You're wrong Trace, these people need our help. Granted, they maybe harmless, but they're also defenseless. So what's the come one? We have gasoline. Lots of it. And we intend to share it. Sure you do. We designed a formula that works. We move into a region, we establish our presence that offers security and protection. And set up an operable state. Well, I'll believe that when I see it. What're you going to report to the Ambassador about the convoy? If the old fool would've listened to me, there wouldn't be anything to report. I don't get it. We're soldiers, not security guards. We should be taking the fight to Scourge, before it's too late. So you and the Ambassador go a long way back. Yeah, him and his new government. What a joke. Somebody has to piece this thing back together, right? They're blood suckers. They advertise free gas and when the people start getting dependant, they start upping the price! What makes you such an expert? I've been down that road before... I don't like using people, or being used. This is a cheap excuse. And you're nothing but a quitter. What are you? Some kind of a fucking crusader? Well, at least I know what I am. Is a lot more that you can say. Yeah, I've got your number, you're a head hunter for the Ownership. Nothing but a fucking hired killer. And that's why you're looking for Scourge, right? And who are you to judge me? You don't even have the balls to take a stand. Yeah well, at least I'm not putting out for a bunch of oil pushing pimps! Get her! Where do you think you're going, bitch! We caught this one trying to escape! Throw her into one of the trucks. Move out! Trace? You're leaving, are you? I have to, Spike. You're not coming back? I guess not. Hey, what's wrong? So long, kid. But don't worry, you'll be safe here. Harlan and his men will see to that. It's Scourge. It's Scourge! You, get him out of here! Mutt, this way! Attack! Get the hell out of here! Go! Come on! Get the fuckers! The Ambassador? He's dead. Maybe now we can do what we should've done a long time ago. Harlan's right, Trace. This is it. It's time to call in the big guns for an all out attack on Scourge the fortress. Are you with us? Arlie... Where is she, Spike? The fortress. Is she alright? I don't know. Whose is this? It's his sister's. Why didn't you tell me it was your sister's? I'm gonna get her back. She's not gonna be the same, Trace! I've seen what this people can do to a woman. Even if she is alive, you'll wish they'd kill her. Scourge is nothing but a mad sadistic... Wait for me... We can help you! You've got to give me some food, please! I'm begging you! How can I eat with her drooling over me like this! Take me! Have me! All you want! Like shit, I had you already, and plenty! Give me some food! Listen bitch! Why don't go and fuck a dog? Maybe he'll give her a bone! Arlie! Trace... What the...? Hey! Run! Run! Hold it shit head! Looks like you forgot your flamethrower. You are crazy, walking in here! Hands off you stinking pigs! You filthy fucking goons! Troops are ready, Sir. Very good. - We'll move out in the morning. - Sir! Throw some torches at the fire and burn his eyes out! Nah, let's just peel his skin off. I would like we peeled his skin off. We haven't done that for a while. So we meet again, Trace. Not quite for style, walking in here and trying to steal one of my women. She's not one of your women. What? She's my sister! Well, then I suppose that makes me almost part of your family. Let her go Scourge, let's just keep this between you and me. Cut me loose, and we'll settle this thing once and for all, right now. Not today, I have other things to keep me busy. The Ownership is coming over to... wipe me out. Bringing truth and justice to the frontier. Just what are you trying to prove. I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm merely trying to stop those sanctimonious bureaucrats from destroying my lifestyle. You haven't got a chance. You know that don't you? Maybe... Maybe not. Either way, I don't have a choice. The die's cast. The strong survive. The weak fall by the wayside. In these times, there is no inbetween. You're out of your fucking mind. The charges are set. That's my little trap for your Ownership pals. Excellent, bring him. Let him watch the fireworks. No, no! Alright, bottle up, start the vehicles! Let's go! That's the last unit boss, convoy's ready. Okay, pull out. Let's go! Get out! Hey, there she is! Get her! Fuck the bitch! He, got ya! Arlie, Arlie come on! What're they waiting for? Stinger! Goddamnit, the Ownership must gone to move. That must be what the charges are for. That means he's got the mine, and there's a detonator over there somewhere. Stay here, I'm going for the detonator. Arlie! You men! Come with me! Fire! Move out! Retreat! Move back, retreat! Move it, you assholes! Come on! Attack, let's go! Retreat, retreat! Pull back! Let's go! Come on! Let's go! Move it, come on! Come on, let's go! Come on, come on! Let's move it! Let's go! Let's go! Oh, Mutt! Come on, let's get out of here! - Stinger! - Hey kid, we won the war? We've won Stinger, the Ownership is in total control. We won! Don't move. I'll get help, lay down. It's too late for that. All of you, you've got a clean shot now. I'm counting on you to see that It gets done right this time. What do you say? I'll take care of it. I know. I can hear what you're thinking. I'm sorry. You keep it. Take good care of her for me, will ya Mutt? I'll see ya, huh?
