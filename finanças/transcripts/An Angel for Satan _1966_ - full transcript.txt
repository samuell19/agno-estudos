- Welcome, Sir. - Thank you. Here. - Give that to me. - No, no. Why? That's fine, don't worry. I hope you had a good trip. I'm Alfonso, but everybody calls me Sergeant. Very well, Sergeant. - Good morning, Sergeant. - Good morning, girls. - Who could that be? - A handsome boy. - Lisal - We're coming! - Natalia! - Coming. - Who's singing? - The kids from the school, sir. Look. - Who's that? - That's Vittorio. He's the gardener at the villa. A simple man. He cuts himself whenever he chops wood. The teacher stitches him up every time. He's been put into a mental asylum twice, but he always comes back. He wouldn't hurt a fly. - Good morning and welcome, sir. - Thank you. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - It's not good weather for travel, sir. - It was almost as bad in the city. I'm used to it. - Welcome, Merigi. - Thank you, Count. - I'm happy to see you, but also a bit disappointed. - Why? - Why? - You came by the lake and you're fine. - What do you mean? Well, my bad side hoped for a tragedy, to keep the legend of the lake alive. And I guess your good side wouldn't have felt as happy. Exactly. Make yourself comfortable. Sit down. Would you like a drink? A Cognac? A rosolio? A Centerbe, perhaps? It's made in a mountain convent, it will warm you up. A Centerbe it is, then. - I think we'll get along fine. -Sodol. - To your arrival. - To your health. - Cigar? - No, thanks. I don't smoke. Sit down. As you know, last summer's drought caused the lake's water level to dramatically decrease. That's when a two centuries-old tragedy resurfaced. - You mean the statue, Count? - Yes, precisely. But you wouldn't know about this story. You're an outsider. If the Goddess demands a sacrifice, and if the curse is real, it would befall the entire village. That would make the legend true. As of today, you will live here. I know you've studied Machiavelli, Count, and therefore you enjoy playing games, so I wonder if I should be wary of something. I only wish you had told me about the curse when you hired me. - You would have refused. - Quite the opposite. Legends are what make art immortal. However, I'm a practical man. If it weren't for my beloved niece Harriet, who'll be here soon, the statue would be be at the bottom of the lake and you wouldn't be here. I love hearing about legends but I don't believe in curses. - When can I start working? - Even tomorrow, if you'd like. Anything you need, you can ask my butler. - Do you need anything in particular? - No, thank you. I'll have a bottle of that Centerbe sent to your room. A sip before bed and you'll sleep heavenly. Come in. Count, something terrible has happened. - What's wrong, Guglielmo? - The two boatmen who accompanied Mr. Merigi... An inexplicable tragedy, Count. They came to the village to have a drink. Then they went back to the boat and started crossing the lake. After a few minutes, and for no reason, their boat flipped and sank. They were good boatmen and swimmers, but they couldn't. They started screaming for help. Carlo, Vittorio, and the teacher all rushed to help. They all jumped into the water, but it was too late! - They watched them drown! - Dead... They were the two boatmen who recovered the statue from the lake. My dear, you couldn't expect her to stay in school all her life. This place is hers. It's only logical that she returned home. But Harriet won't be able to do anything without you. She's too young and naive. She could get robbed. You can't let that happen. - What's wrong? - Mr. Merigi is here. So? Aren't we free? You're a widow and I'm a bachelor, what's the problem? I don't like gossip. When Harriet arrives, I don't want her to know about us. What's wrong with her knowing, llla? The truth is your nerves are a wreck. Is Harriet beautiful? Yes, very. Beautiful, wealthy, and free to do whatever she wants. She loves me. I've been a father to her since she was little. Who knows what would happen to her without me. And what would become of you without me? You either throw those pictures in the fire or get out of here. It's up to you. May I ask why? No arguing and no questions, just make up your mind. All right. I've made up my mind. I'm staying here and I'll continue to draw. Just what I expected. Another gentleman who lives at the villa! Another master. We've had enough bad luck. First the statue, then those two poor people losing their lives. And now you're drawing our faces on paper, which will bring more bad luck and cause even more tragedies! Do you need any help? Guess they really beat me up, then. Well, I guess you landed some punches, too. Who did it? Some very big man. Lionesi? But I know him, he's a good man. I wonder what would happen if he was bad, then. We don't have bad men here. Besides, Carlo has a wife and five children. What do people have against me? Try to understand. Two boatmen are dead. - So you believe in the curse? - No. But these are ignorant, superstitious people. They hate the statue found in the lake, the one you're going to restore. They blame it for everything. - Do you know the legend? - I don't. I'm new around here. The locals are surly and wary of outsiders. I only get along with my students. - I'm Roberto Merigi. - I'm Dario Morelli. Good evening, Rita. - Goodbye, I hope to see you soon. - Goodbye. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Finally, dear. - You were here waiting for me to arrive? - Yes. Come, Dario. If you only knew how much I love you. No one must ever come between us, my love. The Count left a message for you, sir. He went to the city to welcome his niece, Harriet. The young lady is arriving tomorrow from England, two days earlier than expected. - Excuse me? - Yes, sir? - You're from these parts, right? - Yes, sir. My family has always had a special connection with the Montebrunos, for more than two centuries. Then you must know the legend of the statue. I've been taught not to mind other people's business. The Count knows everything about this subject. Why, naturally. You're finally home, dear. - Welcome back. - Thank you. As you can see, our park still looks the same. I remember how much you liked playing here, so I wanted to keep it the same while waiting for your return. Come. Harriet Montebruno. Mistress of the house. She will give the orders from now on. Guglielmo, the butler. Vittorio, the gardener. Rosa, the cook. This is Rita, who'll be your personal maid. And this is Sergeant, an old soldier who guards our house. This is llla, the housekeeper. You probably remember her. You were five years old when you left Italy. You were a beautiful little girl, but now you're even more beautiful. Thank you, llla. I'm sure we'll all get along. Come, Rita. What are you doing? I'm working, little girl. My name is Barbara. What's yours? Roberto. Where are you from, young lady? The village. Sergeant knows I come here but he doesn't mind. Sergeant is a good man. And you don't look like a troublemaker. - But you do. - Me? Yes. My dad says that statue is stinky. The statue? Stinky? I don't think so. When my dad says something's stinky, he means trouble's brewing! What kind of trouble? I don't know, but I think it's something about a spell. And you're not scared? No, everybody is scared but I'm not. I like spells! You're a nice little girl, Barbara. Who's your father? Carlo Lionesi, he's the strongest! You should meet him! I know him. I know him, indeed. - Well, I'm going. - See you soon, Barbara. Come and say hello the next time you're around. Sure, so you can tell me if you find anything about the spell. All right, Barbara. I knew she'd leave you speechless, Merigi. Harriet Montebruno, this is Roberto Merigi, sculptor. Please. Identical, right, Merigi? - Harriet and the nymph, two drops of water. - Uncanny. There's an explanation for that, naturally. About 200 years ago, an ancestor of Harriet, named Maddalena Montebruno, wanted her body and face to be preserved in marble. So she hired a famous sculptor of her time. Harriet, as you can see, inherited the looks of that ancestor. Maddalena had a distant cousin named Belinda who lived here with her parents. Please. It's a tragic story, and this is my first meal at home in years. As you wish, my dear. Looking at such young beauty, I confess I've lost interest in old stories. Very well. Thank you. I would actually like to ask you, Miss Harriet, to pose as a model for me, given your likeness with the nymph. The face of the statue is quite damaged, you see. But don't worry, it won't take long. Is it really necessary? No, not necessary. It would be quite useful for a perfect restoration, though. - I accept, then. - Excellent! Just like two centuries ago! The lady, the sculptor, and the statue! Are you afraid of lightning? Yes, since I was a little girl. That's ridiculous, don't you think? We must stop, I cannot work with this light. You think so? We can't go home in this weather! I guess we'll have a long chat, then. I better start answering in advance all the questions you plan to ask me. I'm an orphan. I was educated in London for fifteen years. At last, I can collect the inheritance my parents left me. - Is that enough for you? - Yes, for the moment. - But there's something else I'd like to know. - Go on. At dinner you refused to hear the story behind this statue. Why did you ask the Count to hire me to restore it, then? What do you mean? I didn't ask him. It was his idea. I see. Well, I also restore paintings, statues, and mosaics, but my dream is to become a famous sculptor. And I'm alone. I mean, I'm not married. I haven't met my ideal woman yet. Now that we know each other, I suggest we use our first names. Don't you think it's too soon, Mr. Merigi? No, I don't think so. It's not too soon. I'm parched. That liquor. Roberto. Roberto. Roberto. Roberto. Roberto. Roberto. Come in. Don't be afraid. Come. Come closer. I'm here. It's me, Belinda. Me, Belinda. I'm Belinda. This is the way I looked. I was hideous. While my cousin Maddalena charmed so many men with her beauty. How I hated her! When that young sculptor carved the marble nymph, I cried tears of anger and jealousy. I hated that symbol of beauty. I longed to be loved, caressed, kissed, possessed. But I repulsed men. They laughed at me. They always wanted her. Her, the statue. They displayed it by the lake. The beauty. Her beauty triumphed. And what about me? I was alone in my world, filled with agonizing anguish. Then, one night, I entered the sculptor's bedroom. I wanted to beg him for a caress, just once. Just once. But I found him with Maddalena. I wanted to kill them both. But I couldn't bring myself to do it. I left. I was running in the park, desperately. I stopped in front of that damned statue. I wanted to destroy it. Damn you! Damn you! We died together. Me and the image of beauty. And now Maddalena is back again, in Harriet's body. You can't love her! She's cursed! She's cursed, too! Her treachery is hidden under her beauty. If you love her, the curse will also befall you. Remember, no one will be spared. Tragedy and death will reign until she disappears. How do you feel? Do you feel better? Yes. Yes. I think so. I must have been very ill. What happened to me? You were delirious. Don't you remember? No. I'm not sure. That liquor... Don't talk. You need to rest and recover. There's only one thing that would cure me immediately. What thing? Take my hand again, please. What are you saying? - Your medicine, sir. - What is it? A cordial. Drink it. It'll make you feel better. I'd like to know what happened to me. Just a passing malaise, sir. You'll recover soon. - I'm scared. - Scared of what? I don't know. - I'm scared. - Don't worry, Harriet. Nothing will happen to you, as long as we're together. Yes. Yes, I know. Don't ever leave me. Ever. It's so beautiful to be alive. So beautiful. Don't you think so, Rita? Do you have a boyfriend? Do you? Come on, tell me. I'l be happy if you do. I do, Miss. - Do I know him? - I don't know. Come on, tell me who it is. He's the schoolteacher. He's alone. He's been here for a short time. The Count permits him to take his students to our park, and that's how we met. - Does he love you? - Yes, but he's so shy, you see. I believe I'm his first girlfriend. Thank you. Good night, Rita. Good night, Miss. Are you tired? Come to bed. - Here's our Michelangelo at work. - I don't pretend to be as good as him. Don't make such a grumpy face. And don't call me Harriet. My name is Belinda. Don't you like Belinda? Belinda? What are you talking about, Harriet? Why that name? - Don't touch me! - Harriet! - Let go of me, I said! - Are you crazy? What's wrong? What's wrong? Don't you know I love violence? I adore it. Hold me, hold me tight. That's enough! No one can have Belinda. She's pure. She's above everybody. Only the lake had her. I want to warm by the heat of your fire, Vittorio. Take off my boots. Have you ever seen a naked woman? Have you? Don't you dare look at me. I told you not to look, or you'll regret it. Would you like to see me? Answer me. The heat of a fire feels just like a kiss. Doesn't it, Vittorio? I warned you! You brute! Be quiet, children. It's not a reason to laugh if one of you gives a wrong answer. So, Berto. It's true that horses and donkeys have a tail, but that's connected to their posterior, understand? That's the right word, "posterior." But my dad says the right word is "ass"! Finally, a happy school. Good morning, Miss. Stand up, everyone. - Your name is Dario, I presume? - tis. - I'd like to speak with you for a minute. - Of course. Barbara, I want you to watch over your classmates. I'm Harriet Montebruno, pleased to meet you. I know who you are, Miss. You're rather young to be a teacher. Someone told me about you. - About me? - Yes. You're in love with Rita? - Well, Miss, I... - She loves you, too. I don't mean to pry into your personal life. I just wanted to give you a small bit of advice. You should try to, well, you should try to be less shy around her, if you get what I mean. Rita has been with me for a short time, but I believe I understand how she thinks. I want her to be happy. You two should meet more often. - I'd like to, but... - My park is an ideal place for people in love. Go there tonight. And excuse me for minding your private affairs, but you're both so young. - Will you do it? - Certainly, Miss. Thank you. - Good morning. - Good morning. You're very strong. As a matter of fact, I am. I don't think you like me very much, is that right? It's not about you, it's the statue. It should have stayed where it was. We fear it will cause more tragedies. A man like you believes in such foolishness? That wheel must be heavy. Very. But I could throw it 20 meters away, if you wish. - I think you're exaggerating, Carlo. - You'll see. Try asking that sculptor of yours to do the same. - Ask him to do the same. - Oh, he'd never be able to. Such lovely children. Are they yours? Yes, including Barbara, who's at school. That little girl is such a pest! - I sprained my ankle! - Damn it! Come to my house, Miss! Prepare something, Agnese! Does it hurt? No. Thanks for your help, but I must return home. I can't ride my horse. - Could you carry me? - Certainly, Miss. Absolutely. Alberto, you keep an eye on the horse. You're so strong. Come see me tomorrow. I have something to tell you. Guglielmo, go look for Mr. Merigi upstairs. Uncle, please, he probably had a good reason. Tell him that he's excused for his absence at the table, and we'd like him to join us. Yes, sir. You barely touched your food. Your face looks so, let's say, autumnal. - I'm feeling great, and I have no reason to... - I'm sure of that. It's peculiar that you're both not hungry, though. I'm sorry for asking, Harriet, but is there something between you two? - What do you mean, Uncle? - No, dear, what I mean was some little argument, something like that. No. Very well, let's forget about it. You'll be receiving your inheritance in a few days. You'll have documents and bills to check, it's quite a lot of work. Please, Uncle. Let's not talk about it now. Let me relax for a little longer. Didn't you always handle such matters? All right, my dear. As you wish. Count, I entered his room after knocking on the door, but he wasn't there. - Mr. Merigi. - Hello. I saw the light in the window and I thought... - Why don't you come in? - No, thanks. I've been working all day and I'm tired. - I just wanted to say hello. - That's very kind of you. - You're a good man, Sergeant. Good night. - Good night. By the way, there's something I wanted to ask you. - Perhaps you could do me a favor. - Of course, go on. - When I got here, I left a bag with some tools on the boat. - But the boat sank. Indeed, I know it'd be a hard task. Could you hire some fishermen to try and salvage the wreck? - Naturally, I'd pay for it. - I don't see why not. - I know just the men. I'll take care of it. - Thank you, Sergeant. Good night. By the way, I don't want anyone at the villa to know about this. - They would wonder why I didn't ask them in the first place. - Don't worry. - Thank you. Good night. - Good night. Checkmate! Listen to me, Harriet, and go to sleep. Chess requires attention, you can't play it while daydreaming. I had no idea you became so grumpy. Hey, Merigi! - Good night. - No, wait a minute! Wait a minute. Where have you been? I was working, sir. I hope to finish in a couple of days. Good night. I want you to come here and apologize to my niece. Come on. Good evening, Miss. Good evening. Please, forgive my absence from dinner. No. There's no need to do that in front of me. I have a little headache. Playing chess is stressful. Good night. You know very well why I'm behaving this way. There's a reason behind it, then. It's better this way. I struggled with doubts about quitting the job and leaving. But there's something I have no doubt about. I won't be your laughing stock. Laughing stock? What are you talking about? - Stop acting innocent! - You're crazy! You're totally crazy! You can't treat me like this. Harriet. Harriet, look at me. This morning you came to me and acted so differently than usual. - You acted like another person. - How? - This morning, I... - For the love of God, Harriet, what's happening to you? Nothing, Roberto. I was so happy, so joyful. And now you... No. Roberto. Go to sleep. Go. Rita. Rita, my dear. You. Yes, me. Kiss me. Kiss me. When someone is brave and strong, he's not afraid of any statues or lakes! You thought the opposite until yesterday. You sided with those rich folks. I haven't sided with anyone. You shaved and you're wearing your Sunday clothes. Who are you trying to impress? I'm not trying to impress anybody, but one day you will all lick my boots! Sure, laugh at me, you clowns. You board up in your houses every night because you're afraid of witches. Yet, you live with those witches of your wives! - You bastard! - Buffoon! Fatso! I'll cool you off, come on! Freshen up, you maggot! I'm gonna relieve you for good, you rotten bastard! Don't pull my hair! Tell me, Rita, you like being kissed? Come on, answer my question. I know you like it. You're very beautiful, you know? Has he ever told you? Has he? All men are evil. Didn't you know? They enjoy making us suffer. - No. - Yes. Your man does, too. It's pointless to be a romantic like Harriet. I've known that for more than 200 years. All men are evil. Belinda knows. You're too beautiful for them, Rita. - Who is it? - Guglielmo, Miss. One moment. My nightgown. Come in. Carlo is here, Miss. He said you called for him. Yes, Guglielmo. I have a job for him. You can go, Rita. - Good morning, Miss. - Good morning. Your perfume makes my head spin. You like it? - You scare me. - Me? Scare you? No. Too bad you already have a wife and children. I'm going crazy, Miss. Crazy. Oh, I'm so sorry. There's another man who says that. A person I don't fancy much, an unlikeable individual. Who is this man? Oh, he's just a boy. But he's very rude and insistent. I believe his name is Dario. Yes, that's it. Dario. The schoolteacher! I'll take care of him if you wish, Miss. No, thanks, Carlo. I'll do it alone. How I longed for some happiness. Someone who really loved me. But everything is so rotten here. This swamp you call a lake. This house. These horrible people. I regret coming back to this house. But you could help me. Only you. Hold me and promise you'll never leave me. Do you love me? Please, tell me you do. Yes, Rita. Yes. Why do I feel so unhappy? Why? Rita, what's wrong? - Are you ready or not, Luisa? - Yes, I'm done. Let's go, come on. I wonder why Natalia didn't come today. - I guess she stayed home. - Maybe she's helping her mother. Luisa, look! My God! Natalia. Natalia! Natalia! Natalia! Natalia! Natalia! I brought flowers. But I can't ease the pain you're feeling. We have no use for your pleasantries. It was you who had that cursed statue recovered from the lake. You have brought enough bad luck upon us. Get out of my sight! Why? Why? Tell me! What does this mean? - Damn witch! - You put a curse upon us! Go away, you damn witch! You brought the curse to our village! Go away! It's all your fault! - Throw the statue back into the lake! - You cursed us! Go away! Go away, you damn witch! Let's go, Rita. This expense report needs to be more detailed. You think so? I'll rewrite it. No. I'll handle it personally. All right. - Has Harriet returned? - No, not yet. I'll go meet her. Go home. I must go back, I must go back! - Miss! - Don't argue and do as I say! - Rita? - Count, your niece... - I saw. Where is she going? - I don't know. She said she was going back. Strange. Strange, indeed. Go. I knew you were following me. You killed Natalia. You took off her clothes to see her naked. You raped her. Then you killed her in a fit of rage. Don't be afraid. Nobody suspects you and I won't say a thing. But you're still not satisfied, are you? Now you have your eyes on Luisa and Maria, admit it. That's right, you desire them. And then you'll have me too. Yes, even me. Go, and don't tell anyone about this conversation. You stupid bitch! - One day I'm gonna kill the lot of you! - What did I do to you? This kind of life must be a nightmare for a man like you. I'll kill them. I swear I'll kill them all. Everyone has their own problems, my friend. I was just going to see the schoolteacher to tell him to stop bothering me. What else can I do? I'm just a weak woman, after all. Did you need me, Mr. Merigi? - I need to ask you a favor, Guglielmo. - At your service, Sir. I'm going to leave this room, and you'll wait here for my return. It won't take more than a few minutes. Don't be alarmed if you hear my voice when I'm outside the room. Yes, sir. I don't understand, though. It's just a game, Guglielmo, or, if you prefer, a surprise. As you wish, sir. Can you hear my voice, Guglielmo? I'm coming down, don't move. Well, Guglielmo? Yes, Mr. Merigi, I heard your voice. It was muffled, but clear enough. It sounded like it was coming from the fireplace. I hope you'll give me an explanation. I'm afraid you wouldn't understand, Guglielmo. Or, maybe, you'd understand too well. Sorry to disturb you. Sit down. Looking at your students' homework? I wish my notebook was among these. Have you seen Rita? Yes, Miss. And you told her? No, I didn't tell her anything. I didn't want to upset her. Rita sends a Kiss. Do you want it? No! Take your hands off me! Don't touch me! - You rascal! Let go of me! - What? I don't understand! Take your hands off me, I said! Leave her alone! Stop it! I didn't tell you to Kill him. I feel so tired. I feel like I've done some heavy work. You came in so late. That's true. Weren't we together? Yes, Miss, but then you... Don't you feel well? What's wrong? What could possibly be wrong? Stupid! Come here. Do you like me, Rita? Look at me. Look at me. We're much more beautiful than any man. Don't you agree? You must have a beautiful body. No. Miss. Wait, I want to give you this. It's a gift. But you must do something first. Do as I say and you'll live a luxurious life. We'll have so much fun together. So much fun making men suffer. That's him, huh? - He's come for you. - Yes, I believe so. Go meet him. Tell him you don't love him anymore. Tell him it's all over between you two. You understand me? Look at me, Rita. - Do you understand me? - Yes, yes. Swear. Swear that's what you'll tell him. Do it or I'll banish you from this house. Or worse, maybe! You'll regret it for the rest of your life. Swear! Swear you'll tell him! I swear. Now go. Rita. What's wrong? I'm terribly upset, Rita. I don't know what's going on. Everything was going so well before. But now I don't understand things anymore. Help me, my dear. Help me, I beg you. Why are you crying, Dario? Rita. Let's leave this place. Let's move to another village. I'm scared. I'm scared that the curse might be real. I feel so confused. I love you so much, dear. Let's go away. We'll get married. I can't kiss you anymore, Dario. I don't want to. Rita, what are you saying? I believe I don't love you anymore. We'll never see each other again. Never again. Rita, why are you talking like this? Why? You'll find a better girl than me. I'm sorry, Dario. I don't want you anymore. I don't know why, but I don't love you anymore. It was her, wasn't it? It was she who forced you to say such things! I love you, Rita! I can't live without you! Please! My life is over if you leave me! Harriet. Roberto. I feel like I'm suffocating! What's wrong? Harriet! Harriet! - Help! Help me! - Should I get someone? - What's wrong? - Help me, Roberto! - I can't breathe! - Should I get Rita? I don't know what to do! I can't breathe! Harriet, you want me to... - You scoundrel! I never imagined you'd be capable of this! - Harriet! Harriet! Uncle! Uncle! It's horrible, he attempted to violate me in my room! Harriet! What are you talking about? Yes! He tried to rip my clothes off! - You've abused our hospitality, Mr. Merigi. - No, sir. I'm just an innocent victim of your niece's strange behavior. I don't think this climate is suited for her sensitivity. Good night. He's lying. His work is done, but he refuses to leave. And you know why he has no intention to leave? Do you know why? Because it's me he wants! He wants me! That's the truth. Good evening. I'm afraid it was a mistake to fish this statue out. The locals hate it, but it's so beautiful. Did you know they called me a witch? Roberto. Wait, please. Say something. What did I do to you? No! Our poor teacher! No! No! Help! Help! Help! No! Help! Help! Help! Help! It was him! It was he who killed Natalia! Help! He's crazy! Come on! Get him! Get him, come on! Come on! Let's get him! Let's finish him! I was looking for you, Mr. Merigi. - What is it? - They salvaged the boat. - Where is it? - On the shore, by the cane field. Let's take a look. Hey, look a this! There's a hole, surely done by an axe. Those poor people weren't killed by magic. This is the proof. They were murdered. There's a fire up there. It's a big one. - How did it happen? - It was Carlo! - He's gone crazy! - He said he wanted to get rid of his family! Water! Bring more water! - Hurry! - Bring more water! Water! The children! Where are the children? - The children are still inside! - The wife, too! - Why did he do this? - He was shouting that witch's name! It's her fault! Quick! Water! Water! More water! Hurry! Barbara. It wasn't my father. It wasn't my father. It's the spell. It was the spell. I'm alone now! I'm alone! It was her, she told me. It's true. The mistress. She got inside me! Inside me! Do you understand? Now I'm going to tell it to your mother and the others. Don't move, I'll return soon. - It was her! - It's all her fault! Death! Death to her! Let's burn that witch! - Yes! - Let's go! Stop! Listen to me! - Listen to me! - You were with her, too! Let him finish! He risked his life for the little girl! Listen to me. I've seen and heard many things at the villa. This isn't about witches or spells, it's about criminals and murderers! I swear I'll find the culprit. I swear it on that little girl's death! Look at me, Harriet. Look at me. Stop resisting. Look at me! You'll now obey my orders, as your mind has always done ever since you were a child. Will you do it? Answer me. Yes. Stand up. You'll now go to Carlo's house. People will surround and threaten you. But you won't be afraid. You will despise them. - And you won't be afraid when they'll swarm. - And try to kill you! That's what you want, you bastard. You want this poor girl to die at the hands of those justice-seeking locals! What are you talking about? You're crazy! I heard everything, you scoundrel! I swore on a little girl's death that I'd bring the culprit to justice. I'll do it no matter what! If you want to listen, I'll explain everything about Harriet. She's insane. It's all her fault. - The statue... - What are you talking about? You used the statue for your evil schemes! You wanted to remain the sole owner of everything! That was your plan. You caused the death of the two boatmen, that was another part of your horrible charade. And the drugs in the liquor, or the voices telling me about the legend of the lake. You also used your hypnotic power on this poor girl. Coward! I should bring you to justice, but you have so many victims! I'll let the locals put you down like a dog! Let's go! No! No! No! Please, listen to me. It wasn't me. It wasn't me behind all this. I too was forced by something much stronger than me! Much stronger than me! We were blinded by our passion. It was she who wanted the statue recovered. It was she who put the curse on Harriet, on this house, and on me! The blood of Belinda flows through her veins! She's blinded by hate and she wants revenge! It was her fault! It was her! It was me! Yes, it was me! It was me who drove Dario to his death, it was me who had Natalia killed! I wanted to destroy love in all of its forms! That's why I destroyed Carlo, Vittorio, and the little girl! Their feelings made them weak! Yes, the blood of Belinda flows through my veins. But I'm a winner, not a victim like her! I've used the force of hate to destroy love! Nobody will stop me! Roberto. You're safe. Damn you! Damn you! Subtitled by Francesco Massaccesi
