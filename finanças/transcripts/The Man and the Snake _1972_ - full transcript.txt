(gentle music) - Good evening, my name is Brayton. I believe doctor and Mrs. Druring are expecting me. - Will you come in, sir? - Thank you. - Chilly out, isn't it? - Yes, it is rather. - [Voiceover] Who is it, Molly? - Mr. Brayton, ma'am. - Mr. Brayton, how nice to see you. - Good evening, Mrs. Druring. - I'd like to commend you on your fine progress in tutoring my son. - Thank you. - Malcolm seems to idolize you. But what's more important, he's actually beginning to enjoy his studies. - Malcolm's a bright boy. - [Voiceover] He was rather disappointed when I told him he wouldn't be dining with us, I'm afraid. - [Voiceover] I'm sure Malcolm sees quite enough of me. - My husband said he wanted a word with you as soon as you arrived. He's waiting for you in the- Malcolm, it's well past your bedtime. Mischievous lad, sometimes. Molly, will you show Mr. Brayton to the conservatory? - Yes, ma'am. - The conservatory is where my husband indulges his scientific side of his nature. The study of animal life. I should warn you, Mr. Brayton, his taste unfortunately runs rather to the lower types. - You come this way please, sir. Find the doctor in here, sir. - Dr. Druring? - [Voiceover] Ah, Brayton, is that you? - [Voiceover] Yes. - [Voiceover] It's so great you could come. - [Voiceover] I had no idea you were renowned a scientist. So this is what your wife meant by the lower types. - I see she's been getting at you already. Yes, my scientific interests are decidedly reptilian. Dragons of the prime, nature's vulgarians, I love them all. And my wife refers to me as the Zolar of Zoology. - Mrs. Druring apparently doesn't share your enthusiasm. - No, and therefore she has been excluded from what I call the Snakery, and doomed to the companionship of her own kind. Malcolm I'm pleased to say, shares my interests in snakes. But I expect he's mentioned it to you. - Oh yes, oh yes he has. But I had no idea that he had access to live ones. - Yes well, I hope Brayton that you won't do anything to discourage him. - Certainly not, certainly not, I always encourage my pupils in outside interests. - Well my wife you see, is utterly opposed to our son following in my reptilian footsteps. You mustn't allow her to charm you into dissuading Malcolm. - Certainly not. - Well now let's show you some of my beauties, come over here. Now, here let's start with him. Now this lovely fellow here, is a Royal Python. He comes from Africa, he's quite a nice chap. - Is he dangerous? - No, no, no, no, no, he's a little friend, this one. Look at this, you see, when you hold him like this he rolls himself up into a ball, some people call them Ball Pythons. He's about four years old, that chap. Isn't he beautiful? - [Voiceover] Yes- - [Voiceover] They never close their eyes. - Excuse me sir, it's nearly 8:00. - Oh, yes. Very well. Alright, tell Mrs. Druring that I'm coming. - Very good, sir. - I'm sorry about that, I shall have to go and dress for dinner I'm afraid. Yes it is, it is 8:00. Well, now would you like to go on having a look around here, or perhaps you'd care for a drink? - Well with your permission doctor, I would prefer a drink. - Yes, alright sir, come along this way, here we are. - Up the stairs. - Hurry, please, Cecil, the Gordons will be here any minute. - The Gordons? You haven't invited them? - Now Theo, they're only in England for a few weeks. - Colonel Gordon has spent nearly 30 years in India, and has never, I repeat never seen a specimen of a King Cobra. A most tiresome fellow. - Running like rabbits they were. (laughter) - My dear, doesn't it terrify you, living so close to those awful reptiles? - After 20 years, one gets used to anything. - Just the idea that at any moment you may meet some venomous creature prowling the corridor, I can't bear to think of it. - You're not far from the truth, Mrs. Gordon. - What do you mean? - It's been something of a tradition, that my creatures have been found in parts of the house where it might have been embarrassing for them to explain their presence. - Don't let him frighten you, Mrs. Gordon, some of Theo's snakes are perfectly harmless. But I quite agree with you, snakes in the home are detrude, matter out of place, an impertinence. Even the Barbara's taste of our time is not quite fitted to place in the home for these savage bits of jungle life. - Oh, just to think they breathe the same air. - Pardon me doctor, I have something of a surprise for you this trip home. - Good, I like surprises. - Before leaving Delhi, I came across a snake charmer with an enormous cobra. First I'd ever set eyes on. A King Cobra, to be sure. - Well, the details man, the details. - A terrifying experience. I'd been watching the snake charmer for some time, and I suddenly became aware that the cobra was staring at me, it made me shudder. My eyes became fixed, fossils it were, to the shining glare of the creature's eyes. Damn near took my soul away. I felt rooted to the ground... My blood grew strangely cold, I felt a gradual freezing, vein by vein, throbbed my entire person. These poisonous snakes can charm you, of that I am convinced. - If I might say so, Colonel, a charming story. (laughter) - A snake charming a man? Bah! You don't believe in this charming nonsense, do you Brayton? - I certainly do not. It may be possible for a man to charm a snake, but the reverse? A snake charming a man? Strikes me as the greatest of fancies. - Oh, the sensations I described were these just the same. And Mr. Brayton, I read recently in an old scientific work that it has been tested by many wise and early people that snakes possess some magnetic property, and whoever falls under their suasion is drawn towards the creature, despite his will, and perishes by the snake's bite. And that, Mr. Brayton, was in Old Master's Marvels of Science. - With all due of respect Colonel, the only marvel in the matter, is that the wise and learned administers, they should have believed such nonsense. Excellent wine, doctor. - Shall we leave the gentlemen, then? - Of course. - Well gentlemen, I have some excellent brandy in my studies, this way. (knocking) - Malcolm, you gave me such a fright. Thought one of those creepy things had got loose again. What are you doing in here? You know your mother doesn't like you in here, with these slimy creatures. Now look, do you want me to tell Mr. Brayton that you're in here and that you won't go to bed when you're told? He'll come and give you what for, that's for sure. Filthy, venomous things. - Come Brayton, bring your drink and we'll go to the Snakery. - Splendid. - In that case, I'll leave you two. Goodnight, Mr. Brayton, please come and see us soon again. - Goodnight Mrs. Druring, and thank you so much for your kind hospitality. - Now Theo, don't keep our guest too long. - I won't. - I'm sure he has better things to do than look at snakes. - Goodnight, Amelia. - I hope you don't mind staying on for a bit. - Not at all. - It's just that, that man Gordon spoils any chance of an interesting evening with his awful stories. I think I'm looking forward to continuing our conversation in private. That's odd. I'm sure I closed it earlier. - Gordon seems so true to type, somehow, don't you think? I mean the bluff, hearty soldier, not much imagination I'd have thought. I'm surprised that he of all people should fall prey to such alarming fantasies. - My dear boy, Colonel Gordon is like any other Indian army waller, can't resist a good story. Especially if it's got any oriental hocus-pocus in it. He'll be serving up the Indian road trip next. He could have done well in the mess old boy, what? - It's curious isn't it, how people have such an inherent fear of snakes? - Yes. You know, children, I mean little toddlers, who are instinctively terrified by the sight of a large animal, such as a cow or a dog, show absolutely no fear of snakes. I mean, they'll reach out their hand to touch them, and they've even been known to handle venomous snakes without coming to any harm. - Extraordinary. - Yes. Now I look upon the snake with a totally different feeling from most people, to me the snake is an object of wonder, I marvel at their physical grace. Here, come over here and I'll show you one here. The black mamba. Isn't he a beauty? - Poisonous? - Oh my dear chap, one of the deadliest snakes on earth. His poisons are of the neurotoxic kind, it attacks the nervous system, causes paralysis. When bitten, a man will die within an hour. Ah, come over here. You will find this interesting, he just shed his skin, you see? That's a black snake from India. - You know, I believe the serpent is more widely distributed in mythologies of the world than any other creature. Snakes even appear in myths of lands where there are no snakes, such as home of the Eskimo. - [Voiceover] Yes, this is quite true. (sighs loudly) - You find it hot in here, I expect. - A bit humid. - They certainly have a thoroughly evil reputation. - Yes. (music playing) - Yes well to people whose religion is based on the Bible, the snake is certainly the arch-villain. But it wasn't so at all to those people who worshiped the deities of Ancient Egypt, or Rome, or Greece. To them, the serpent was a hero, savior, healer. A symbol of medicine, full of curative powers. Good gracious me, afraid the time is nearly midnight. How time flies when one's in good company. - I've enjoyed every minute. - Are you squeamish? - Why do you ask? - Well, I ought to feed one of my snakes, and some people find that it is not really a pretty sight. - I think I can bear it. - Good, good, it will only take a moment. (mouse squeaking) Well now, to bed. Hey you'll stay the night, of course. - Oh no, no, no I wouldn't like to put you out. - My dear chap it's no trouble at all, I mean you'll never get a cab this time of night. Of course you must stay, come along. You know, I question man's feeling of revulsion and horror at the sight of these creatures, I mean why the horror? It's out of all proportion to the creatures real power, they think horrors of the myth, not of the creatures. - The power to fascinate, which Gordon believes in so... (music drowning out voices) - Let me show you the way. There we are. Just turn this up. Phew, stuffy in here, it's like you're breathing cotton wool. - Don't worry. - I'll just open a window. There we are, that's better. Well, my boy? - I shall be most comfortable here. - Good, well, plenty of books here if you want any reading matter. I can recommend this, if you're not too bored with the subject of snakes. You'll find more information on one page of this than you will in the home of Merrister. - I'm sure I'll find it fascinating. - Good, well, I'll say goodnight then. - Goodnight. - Sleep well. - I will, thank you. - Oh, and if you want anything just call out, I rather suspect the servants have gone to bed by now. - Thank you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (gentle music playing) (dramatic music playing) - I've just acquired by exchange with Dr. Muller a splendid specimen of Othello Vargas. - And what might that be? - Bless myself (mumbles)... My dear, a man who ascertains after marriage that his wife doesn't know Greek, should be entitled to a divorce. Othello Vargus is a snake which eats other snakes. - I hope it will eat all yours. How do they get to other snakes? By charming them I suppose? - Oh Amelia, please, you know how irritating that idea is to me. (screaming) - Breyton? - Is he all right? - Quick Molly, help me. Give me a hand, turn him over. Gently, gently. Get me that hamper off the dressing table. - What's happened to him, sir? (shushing) - He's dead. - Oh, how dreadful. Poor man. - Molly, you better go and tell Mrs. Druring. I'll see to things here. Good God, how did this thing get in here? (gentle music playing)
