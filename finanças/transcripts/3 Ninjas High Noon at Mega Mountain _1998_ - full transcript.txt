NARRATOR: Centuries ago, a village in Japan lived in peace, protected by the power of the Golden Broadswords. And now, young warriors, you have been chosen to wrest the sword from evil hands and return it to its rightful place. [♪♪♪] Ninja. Let the games begin. Let's do it. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! [ALARM BUZZING] [GRUNTS] Whoa. [EXCLAIMING] [GRUNTS] [EXPLOSIONS] Hyah! Hyah! Let's go, TumTum, come on. ALL: Hyah! Yeah! All right! Way to go! We were awesome! Piece of cake. Speaking of cake, let's eat. So you think you're feeling pretty good, huh? Why shouldn't we? We smoked that course. Shredded it! Kicked its butt. You think you're master of your domain, don't you? What gives, Grandpa? I thought you'd be proud of us. We got the sword. A ninja's journey is never over until he returns from whence he came. [EXCLAIMING] Beware, young ninjas. Try to find you. [GRUNTS] Whoa! [EXPLOSIONS] Ouch. Congratulations, you all passed with flying colours. Yeah, black and blue. You just learned a ninja's most valuable lesson, humility. Don't you mean the agony of defeat? Agony in defeat. [EXCLAIMING] When the ninja's head swells with pride he becomes his own worst enemy. He loses focus, his spirit loses balance. He sees, but he is blind. A ninja's eyes can betray him. He must learn to trust his other senses. He must learn to see with his ears. He must be one with his environment. Take this! Go over there and dig a well. Go! [♪♪♪] TUMTUM: I wish we didn't have to go so soon. Now we have to wait another year for more training. Ninja training is cool and all, but this summer was definitely my last. TUMTUM: Don't say that. Grandpa might hear you. COLT: You mean that, Rocky? Hey, don't get me wrong. I love Grandpa, and karate is way cool. But next year I'll be 15. Time to get a job so I have wheels when I get my license. But what about ninja training? I don't think anyone's gonna hire me just because I got ninja experience. Maybe Rocky's got a point. Not you too, Colt. Don't you guys like being ninja warriors? It's just a game we play with Grandpa. I'd kind of like to hang out at the beach more. But we were gonna be superheroes, learn the way of the closed fist, like Dave Dragon. You watch too much TV. TumTum, there's gonna be a lot of good summers here. Yeah. Just because we're leaving doesn't mean you are. ROCKY: I'm 15. Summers are starting to be important to me now. COLT: I miss the beach. ROCKY: Now you got Grandpa to yourself. [♪♪♪] [GUNS COCKING] The men are ready. [♪♪♪] Mom, Dad. MAN: Hey, guys. How are my ninjas? How you doing? I missed you. MAN: How are you? WOMAN: Hi, baby. MAN: How'd you make out? How's my birthday boy, huh? Did you guys have an excellent time? TUMTUM: It was great. We murderized this killer obstacle course and had cake. Ooh. Mom, do you have anything to eat in the fridge? Yeah, ham-and-cheese sandwiches sound okay? Awesome. Awesome. Thanks, Mom. Colt, Rocky. Once a ninja, always a ninja. Sure, Grandpa. Yeah, Grandpa. Anything the matter, Dad? Oh, nothing a little adolescence won't cure. I think it's time to put old Grandpa on the shelf like GI Joe and Buzz Lightyear. I'm afraid our young ninjas have found new thresholds to cross. Well, they do grow up fast. I mean, one minute you're bouncing them on your knee, and the next thing you know they want to borrow the car and date the prom queen. WOMAN: Listen to you two. You sound like they're going off to fight the Crusades. They're still just boys. I gotta get back to work. The FBI waits for no man. All right, baby. I still need you, Grandpa. And I need you, now even more. And as you grow older, the distance between us will become greater. But, if you have this, I'll always be with you. "Where one goes, we all go ." Yes. You coming to my birthday party tomorrow? We're going to Mega Mountain. You bet the world I will. Hurry up. I'm trying. There they are. Let's get them. [ALL SHOUTING] All right, we got you now. CHORUS: ♪ Dave Dragon Go, Dave Dragon ♪ MAN: Oh, no. It's Dragon. [GRUNTS] All right, you guys. Come on, take him out. CHORUS: ♪ Dave Dragon ♪ Thanks, Dave Dragon. Hope you enjoyed this week's exciting episode. Unfortunately, it's our last. After 15 years, the network decided to pull the plug on our show. According to the ratings, most kids don't believe in heroes anymore. So to my legions of young.. warriors who still do believe, my heartfelt thanks for your support. You've given me a lifetime of memories. And as long as you uphold the way of the closed fist: respect courage, trust, honour, teamwork, you'll always be heroes to me. ANNOUNCER: Join Dave Dragon in his final public appearance as he shows you the way of the closed fist. This weekend, at the one, the only, Mega Mountain. TumTum, how about a bologna-ham-cheese-bacon lettuce-tomato-turkey and Swiss sandwich? It's your favourite. No, thanks, Mom. I'm not hungry. [♪♪♪] LOTHAR: There is one main entrance to the park, here on the north side. The entire perimeter is covered with a 10-foot fence, prohibiting all other access. These points, A and B, are emergency exits. "A" squad will split into three groups of six and seize these points. "B" squad will be stationed here, at the pumping station, our point of entrance. Now, three roving patrols will be wandering through the park to take care of any pain-in-the-butt troublemakers. Any problems we put them here, in the holding tank under the roller coaster. Then we seize this area, Master Control. Then the entire park will be at our disposal. Any questions? Good. We strike at noon. [ENGINE SPUTTERING] Amanda, have you seen my mixing bowl? Amanda? Hi. Welcome to the neighbourhood. Oh, thank you. [LAUGHS] Hi, I'm Beverly Morgan-Green. Jessica Douglas. It's nice to meet you. You know, I sure hope they don't have some prissy girl types like the Anderson twins. Hit it! Look out! Whoa! Oh! I'm terribly sorry about your window. Meet my daughter, Amanda. Hello, Amanda. I'm sorry. That's coming out of your allowance. Hi, guys. These are my sons, Jeffrey and Michael. I'm TumTum, he's Colt. JESSICA: Let's see about getting your helicopter back. You want to join us for breakfast? Oh, it's okay with me, honey. Come on. Rocky, breakfast! That helicopter's pretty cool. Did you make it? My dad taught me how. He works for a special effects company. They make all kinds of neat stuff for the movies. You must be the pilot. Rocky, this is Amanda. Thanks. Hi, baby. What do you got there? Just some gizmos I'm designing for my dad's new movie. Cool, a yo-yo. Watch me loop-the-loop. No, don't! [SCREAMS] [ALL LAUGH] Sorry again, Mrs. Douglas. Oh, by the way, Rocky, Jennifer called. She'll meet you at Mega Mountain at 11:00 at the main gate, okay? [LIPS SMACKING] What's Mega Mountain? It's the coolest amusement park in the world. We're going to see Dave Dragon fight the evil Tsunamis. No! COLT: No! But you guys promised me, because it's my birthday. Hey, come on, you two. Be nice to your brother. I have a great idea, Amanda. Why don't you join us? That sounds like fun, but I don't want to impose. [CLEARS THROAT] No, we want you to come. Yeah, Dave Dragon! Hyah! JESSICA: Great, thank you. WOMAN: Hi, welcome to Mega Mountain. Hi, welcome-- Hi, welcome to Mega Mountain. Thank you. Okay, kids. Here are your tickets. Now, your father and I will meet you here at 5:00. Hi, Samuel. Rocky, look after your brother. I don't need a babysitter. Promise me. Promise her. I promise. Great. Well, have a good time, and try and stay out of trouble, okay? Bye. [♪♪♪] So, what do you guys want to ride first? I want to see Dave Dragon. Hey, nobody told us we were babysitting squirts. Get a haircut, Buzz. Nobody's babysitting anybody. They were just leaving, weren't you? [MOUTHING] Come on. Let's go, guys. We don't need them. But you promised Mom. Come on. What's wrong with your brother? Just a terminal case of the stupids whenever he's around Jennifer. Rocky loves Jennifer. Rocky loves Jennifer. Rocky loves Jennifer.

Get your hands off me. What's going on here? Stop! Stop it! [BUZZING] Hello, I'm Sister Beatrice of Our Lady of... Perpetual Motion Hospital. Could I please see your manager? I'll handle this. [LOCK BEEPS] Can I help you? I'm taking up a collection. [♪♪♪] [LAUGHS] [GUNS COCK] You have the right to remain silent. [GUNSHOTS] [PEOPLE SCREAM] Anything you say will be used against you. Move it! Move it! COMPUTER: Remote uplink interconnected. One. Two. Closed-circuit monitors active. Three. Four. Five. The video link is functioning. All stations secure. Excellent. Time to play "Dialling for Dollars." [♪♪♪] A little bit more to the left, sugar. Oh, yeah, that's the spot. Vidphone, sir. Mr. Smithers. Can't you see I'm busy? I'm sorry, sir. He insists it's urgent. Don't forget where we left off, sugar. Smithers, this better be good. [GULPS] Mr. Jacobson, how nice to meet you. Who in God's name are you, and what are you doing in my park? Haven't you heard? I'm the new director of park operations at Mega Mountain, Mr. Jacobson. Or may I call you Harry? No, you most certainly may not. In any case, it's my first day on the job and I'm afraid I'm all thumbs. What would happen if I accidentally increased Raging Waters' speed another 20 miles an hour? Those turns would be awfully hard to manoeuvre. You wouldn't. I would. And I will, if you don't pay me $10 million. You are insane. That's what my shrink tells me. But unless you cough up the dough by 3:00 this afternoon, you'll be broke. You never know when.. a roller coaster might derail, a safety harness might release. Ooh, imagine the lawsuits, Harry. All those heartbroken families, the cover of Time magazine. You'll be the owner of "Murder Mountain." I'll call the cops. I'll call the National Guard. If I so much as smell a cop I'll start taking your customers on the ride of their lives. Drop the money by helicopter.. over the Main Street fountain. Do as I say and no one gets hurt. Harry, when can we go shopping for my new Mercedes? [PEOPLE SCREAMING] Sure is high. 208 feet, to be exact. Sure we should we do this so soon after lunch? What are you, chicken? [IMITATING CHICKEN] Oh, my God, my purse. I lost my purse. Maybe you left it back at the burger place. Uh, you guys go ahead. I'll go look for it. Meet you after the ride? [IMITATING CHICKEN] Shut up, Eric. He's just being considerate. I'm considerate. Don't you mean "conceited"? [GIRLS GIGGLE] [SCREAMING] ♪ Dave Dragon Go, Dave Dragon ♪ ♪ Dave Dragon Go, Dave Dragon ♪ [AUDIENCE CHEERS] ♪ Dave Dragon Go, Dave Dragon ♪ Thank you, boys and girls, moms and dads. You've been a terrific audience. [AUDIENCE CHEERS] That was awesome. Yeah, I forgot how cool he was. Too bad they're cancelling his show. Colt, will you take me backstage to get his autograph? Come on, I want to ride Galactic. It'll only take a minute, please. Go ahead, I'll wait here. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Great show. [CLAPPING] Excellent show. Marvellous, truly marvellous. Thank you. It's always nice to meet some of my older fans. Can I help you? Yes, you can help me. By going to sleep. Klaus? [DART GUN FIRING] Oh! [CHUCKLES] Put him under there. MAN: All right, all right, come on. We're gonna need a couple guys. He's heavy. [MEN GROANING] Hey, what are you doing to Dave? Hey, hey, hey! LOTHAR: Get them. COLT: Get out of here! MAN: Come back here. [LAUGHS] MAN 1: Come here, you little... MAN 2: Let's go! MAN 3: Get that kid. Hi. The guy at the burger place told me someone dropped off a black purse 10 minutes ago? Oh, yeah, it's here someplace. Wait a minute. [DOOR CREAKING OPEN] Hey, where'd you go? Who are those guys? Over there. MAN 1: There they go. Over there. MAN 2: Come on, let's get them. [GRUNTS] Come on, TumTum. [BOTH GROANING] [BOTH LAUGHING] If you come quietly, I promise not to harm you. Otherwise, I feed you to my dogs. [SNARLING] Even ugly dogs can be taught to heel. I don't think you understand who you're messing with. [LAUGHS] Ninjas! Ninjas! There he is. I got him. [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMS] Get me out of here! Hey! Hey! Come here, you little punk, come here. You're all mine. Huh? Yeah. [LAUGHS] Hyah! [GROANS] [SCREAMS] Hyah! [MUTTERING] Hyah! Get up there. Now, what do you want on your tombstone? [LAUGHS] Pepperoni, sausage and onion. Knock it off. Every year, the same old show. Next year we go back to Disneyland. [SCREAMING] COLT: Hyah! [GRUNTING] Hi. [SCREAMS] Hyah! Come and get me. Come on. I'll string you up by your ponytail. Hyah! [SCREAMING] [GRUNTS] [CHEERING] Get off of me! What the heck do you think you're doing there, partner? Have you seen my brothers? They ran in there. Hyah! Hyah! Oh! Hyah! Surprise. Hyah! Give me five. [SCREAMS] Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! All right, way to go. That was awesome. Come on, you mangy dogs. [ALL CHEERING] Hurry up. You've got to see this. Come on. When you guys were fighting, I ran here to get help and I found him like this. What do you think? Probably a sleep agent. And that's not all. Look there. I think someone's taken over the park. COLT: That's impossible. Let's call. It's dead. I already tried. Lookit. What are we going to do? I know someone who can help us. [COUGHING] What the--? What's going on? You were attacked by ninjas. Who are you kids? I'm Colt. These are my brothers, Rocky and TumTum. This is Amanda. We came backstage to get your autograph when we saw those guys attack you. Yeah, but don't worry. We kicked their butts. We think somebody's taken over the park. Maybe ninjas. Well, if what you're saying is true I want to thank you for saving me. But you should let the grownups handle it from here on. I'll see what's up. But can't we come with you? I appreciate it, TumTum. I really do. But real heroes know when to play it cool. I want you guys to stay here till I get back. And don't worry. I'll be back with help soon. Great. We have to sit around here while he get to have all the fun. Hey. Look at this. Those guys must've left it behind when they chased you out. Does it work? We could call the police. [STATIC CRACKLING] Where's the best place to transmit? [♪♪♪] Cool. We can see everything from up here. Switch to channel 9. That's the emergency frequency Dad always transmits on. Great. But what'll we tell them? Ninjas have taken over Mega Mountain? We're just kids. They'll think we're prank callers. TumTum, remember what Dad always tells us to yell in case of a real emergency? Fire! [SIRENS WAILING] [TIRES SCREECH] We've got company. Medusa. That fool. Send them a warning. [SIRENS BLARING DISTANTLY] You heard her. [MACHINE-GUN GUNFIRE] This is way beyond my jurisdiction. Call in the feds. Yes, honey. The cake. I'm not gonna forget the cake. I'm gonna pick it up on the way to the park. WOMAN, OVER SPEAKERPHONE: Sam, urgent call on line two. Hang on one minute, honey. Sam Douglas. What? How long ago? I'm on my way. Jessica, something's happened at the park. I-- I gotta go. MEDUSA: That's the feds. Find me a UHF frequency and patch me through. COMPUTER: Remote uplink interconnected. [HELICOPTER FLYING OVERHEAD] Sam Douglas, FBI. What do you got? Well, not sure. They opened fire on us when we arrived. According to what our spotters tell us, they've got the park sealed off from within. Sam, I've got something. They're broadcasting on UHF. We're gonna have to untrap. Welcome to the party. Good Lord. I want to speak to whoever's in charge. This is Sam Douglas, FBI. Who am I speaking with? Dad! Kids? What's going on? ROCKY: Ninjas, Dad. They're all over the theme park. SAM: Are you boys all right? Is Amanda with you? We're all okay. They cut the phones lines, so we used the radio to call. You did fine, son. You did fine. Now just lay low and let the professionals do their jobs. All right? MEDUSA: How very touching. I hate to break up this family reunion, but I have an agenda to keep. Name your demands. It's a little late for that. Mr. Moneybags himself, Harry Jacobson, is already emptying out.. the piggy banks, as instructed. Get Jacobson here. We need to try and buy some time. Andrews, run her picture through the ViCAP computer. I want to know who we're dealing with. And get me an engineer, now. I told Harry, no police. Now you'll have to suffer the consequences. Watch closely. [BEEPING] Now increase the speed by 20 percent. [PEOPLE SCREAMING] Okay, all right, stop the ride. You've made your point. I don't believe I have. Thirty percent. It's our fault. Those people are gonna get hurt. But we're ninjas. We can stop them. ROCKY: This is way out of our league. This isn't one of Grandpa's crazy adventures. This is real life, Hard Copy stuff. We're unarmed and outnumbered. Maybe we can even the odds. My dad and I worked on these for his new movie. Amanda, this is no time for games. Yeah, what are we gonna do? Beat them at Go Fish? [GASPS] Go ahead, Rocky. Now you. Hey, what about me? TumTum, wait. They're smoke bombs. They explode on impact. If they can't see you, they can't hit you. We can't do it without you. All right. Let's do it. [POLICE RADIOS SQUAWKING] Hold it. Somebody called for an engineer? Look. [RIDERS SCREAMING] MAN: Oh, my God. What happens to those people if that ride goes any faster? At twice its normal speed? Extreme nausea, loss of consciousness, maybe even death. [LAUGHING] Hey, boiled scum. What's the matter? Afraid of someone half your size? Let's get them. Now, TumTum. Hyah! Ah! [RIDERS SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] Boo! Hyah! Why do you use your head to hit my feet? [GROANS] [ALL SCREAMING] Emergency stop. [ALARM RINGING] Oops. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! COMPUTER: Numeric access granted. [GROANS] Power terminated. [SHRIEKS] Patch me through to those little snots. [ALL CHATTERING AND GROANING] And don't even think of escaping, or I'll have to come back and deck you. Get it? "Deck" you? Foolish children. I'll teach you to mess with Medusa. Nice face. Yeah, nice face. Not. We're not afraid of you. Oh, but you will be. Freeze that picture. Get me a printout. Lothar? Medusa. Find those idiot nephews of mine. I have a job for them. [CHUCKLES] [COMPUTER BEEPING] Sam. I've got her. Mary Ann Rogers. Goes by the name of "Medusa." Escaped from prison last month. Talk about your laundry list: Extortion, robbery. You name it, she's done it. And she's rumoured to be looking for a quick score to get out of the country. [SIGHS] This is killer. Are you sure Auntie Medusa won't mind us taking a break? What Auntie M. don't know won't hurt her. Besides, what could possibly be going wrong if her plan is foolproof? I wish this line would move faster. [ALL LAUGH] Hey, no cutting in line. Hey, you're not the boss of me. [ALL LAUGH] You idiots. I told you, no horsing around. If Medusa finds out you've been goofing off-- Oh, no, please! She'll kill us. Okay, then pay attention. You find these kids and maybe I'll let you live. They were last seen over at the Avalanche ride. Hey. This is a covert operation. Put on your glasses. Oh. Now move it! Sorry. [RIDERS SCREAMING] It's been over an hour. What could he possibly be doing? Maybe he got sick. Probably wussed out. Probably wet his pants and he's too chicken to face us. We're wasting time. We should bail. I'm his girlfriend. How could he do this to me? Girl, I've been there, and they're all dogs. [BOY CRYING] Can I have your autograph? Sure. AMANDA: This is interesting. What do you mean? The rides are controlled manually through these switch boxes, but the speeds of the rides themselves, along with the tracking, are monitored through this display. Which means somewhere inside the park there must be some kind of Master Control. Wait. Back at Guest Relations, they had a computer. And it's probably tied into the Master Control. So? So... if I can hack my way into the mainframe computer, I can override the ride controls and shut them down. We wouldn't be fighting. So technically, we wouldn't be disobeying Dad and the bad guys couldn't zap any more of the rides. There they are! Dad didn't say we couldn't defend ourselves. Amanda, we'll draw them out. You go back to Guest Relations and we'll meet up with you. Good luck. Hey! Come and get us! Come on. [BUZZER SOUNDING] [DOOR LOCKS BEEP] My family and I were walking up... COP: Back. Get back. JESSICA: Sam. Sam. What's happening? Are the kids okay? Honey, honey, they're fine. I talked to them, all right? Don't worry, they're all right. It's gonna be fine. Chief Young, how long before the SWAT team arrives? It's 1:30 now. They'll be here in 15 minutes. What do you want? [DOOR LOCKS BEEP] Is there a problem? [BODY THUDDING] Susan Blankenship here, for Eyewitness News. Boss, take a look at this. ...Terrorists have seized the park and are holding its occupants hostage. However, police and FBI officials are not releasing any information regarding the terrorists' demands. I will update you with further developments. Good. That ought to put more pressure on the very rich Harry Jacobson. [ALL LAUGH] Get him. MAN: Get him. Get him. Hold him. Maybe I'll show you mercy and make you my boy-toy. Thanks, but I'd rather be eaten alive by wolves. That can be arranged. Tie him up over there. Come on, get up. C.J.: Excuse me, man. Excuse me. I know we have taken you hostage and all, but could I get an autograph? It's for my sister. C.J. I get it later, man. MAN: Get them! Get them! Come on! Split up! Yeah. Okay, okay, okay! Zed, get that one! Buelow, that one! Come on! Go! Hey, beat it, kid. I'll have $5 worth. [GRUNTING AND MUTTERING] Got you! You couldn't hit an elephant in the butt with a bazooka. Ow! You guys who paid all your money down there, get ready to shoot at the target. [LAUGHING] I'm on your tail. Hey, hey! I'm gonna get you. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! I'm gonna get-- Stop it! I'm gonna get you, and you're gonna pay for this! Hey, hey! Wait, wait, you little twerp. I got you. Whoa, hey. Hey. Hyah! Ah! Hyah! Not the face! Hyah! Exit to your left, everyone. Exit to your left, please. I'm sorry, you guys, you're gonna have to take your seats. I'm sorry, you're gonna have to sit down. We gotta get-- No, see-- I'm sorry. Sit! Down. Ah-ha! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! What's the matter? Bad hair day? Hey! Hey! It won't budge. I know! Shut up! Let's see how they like a taste of their own medicine. Uh-oh. Uh, excuse me. Whoa! Oh, a little faster? [BOTH SCREAMING] Hey, man, check this out. [CHUCKLING] Hmm. Lothar. I'll take care of the geeks myself. They're dog meat. [BOTH SCREAMING] Let's find Amanda. [BOTH GROANING] [ALL RETCHING] Ha, ha. [COMPUTER BEEPS] Here goes nothing. Access denied. Access denied. Ha, ha. Access granted. Yes. Dang, I'm good. [BEEPING] Start with the Atom Smasher. Locked. [♪♪♪] Okay, men. We have a D-9 scenario. SAM: Those are innocent civilians in there. I don't want anybody harmed. Let's move out. Sam? Those guys are the best, honey. Everything's gonna be fine. I hope you're right. [ALARM BEEPS] [TYPING] [LAUGHING]: They're bringing the big guns. Ha! Game over. You're finished. If I were you, I'd cut my losses. Surrender now and beg for mercy. You're no match for the SWAT. Then we'll just have to "swat" them like the bugs they are. They are entering the north, south and east quadrants. [LAUGHING] B squad. Go for B. MEDUSA: You know what to do. DAVE: I'm telling you, you're wasting your time. Spinning your wheels, swimming in circles, going nowhere fast. Ready? Give the word. MAN: Let's go. Come here. Fry them. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLES] [ALL SCREAM] When I get my hands on you, you...you witch! Save your strength, Dragon. You're just wasting your time. Spinning your wheels, swimming in circles, going nowhere fast. [CONSOLE BEEPS] Okay, C.J., do your worst. [LAUGHS] COMPUTER: Access denied. C.J.: What the--? What's wrong? The system's locked me out. Access denied. Try another ride. Access denied. Somebody else must be overriding the system. We are no longer in control. Access denied. Locked. Locked. Try harder. Access denied. Speed control. Access denied. It's not responding, man. Ha. Not responding. Looks like you've got the brawn but forgot the brain. [COMPUTER BEEPING] Access denied. Access denied. Locked. Locked. Access denied. Move over, idiot. Access granted. You want to play games? Watch this. Emergency brakes engaged. [ALL SCREAMING] Oh, no. No! He's starting to bore me. Get him out of my sight. [TYPING] Any further attempts to stop me, I release .. the safety harnesses and presto. Instant pancakes. This is your last warning. It's hopeless. It looks like you're gonna have to pay. I'm on my way to the bank. [GUNFIRE] [CROWD SCREAMING] Keep moving. Go on. Get over there. Open those doors. Get back. Get out of the way. Head back, come on. Turn around. [CROWD GASPS AND MURMURS] Hey, Dragon, I'll show you the Way of the Closed Fist. [LAUGHS] BOY: Why don't you do something? Are you really a hero, or just a phony like my dad says? It's not that simple. These aren't much good against guns. I thought so. What?. Oh, it's you, Auntie M. I mean, Aunt Medu-- I don't know what I mean. MEDUSA: Where were the kids while you imbeciles were joyriding? Well-- Well, you see, the thing is, they kind of escaped is what they did. When I get ahold of you,.. I'll have your heads for this. How about a picture? You want to take a picture? No, you idiot. Not you, Medusa. I'll call you back. Hi, how you doing? I'll, uh, take a picture of, uh, those two. Thank you. [LAUGHS] Thank you. Pay the man. Let's go. JENNIFER: Where is he? Cheer up, there's plenty of fish in the sea. Hey, no sweat. I'll be your new boyfriend. That'll cheer her right up. Yep, that's her. Can I help you? Hi. I have a message from your boyfriend. Samuel? Where is he? Come with me. Hey, butthead, maybe I'm her new boyfriend. [SCREAMS] [LAUGHS] Bummer, man, you peed your pants.

Guess it's too late to talk you out of this. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Respect. Courage. Trust. KIDS: Honour. ALL: Teamwork. Where'd they go? Over there. What are you gonna do with her? A little girl might come in handy as a hostage. AMANDA: Let go of me. Let go of me. After that I'll make you my personal slave so you can work off the money you've cost me. I figure in, oh, say about 50 years we'll be even. You three get back to the ship. Okay. You. Allow me. [GRUNTS] [MEN LAUGHING AND YELPING] Yes! We got money! We got money! We got money! We're rich! We're rich! [BEEPS] I always did like fireworks. There she is. How precious. The three little bears and the big, bad wolf come to rescue Goldilocks. Get them. You want a piece of me? Come and get it. Bring it on. One ninja stew, coming up. [ELECTRICITY ZAPPING] Oh!

Rocky! [MEN COUGHING] Rocky! MAN 1: Where are they? MAN 2: I can't see. COLT: Hold on, Rocky. GRANDPA: When a ninja's head swells with pride, he becomes his own worst enemy. He loses his focus, his spiritual balance. He has eyes but cannot see. [ALL STRAINING] [PANTING] [PIPES RATTLING] Hyah! [BEEPING] Over here. Is that what I think it is? Quick, grab my pack. No, my computer. You'll have to deactivate the timer. My dad showed me how to do it in his last movie. Grab the parallel cord and shove it into the timer slot. Now, type in the words "run sequence." [BEEPS] Insufficient power. The battery must need a recharge. Try using the power cord. It's no good. We need a three-prong outlet. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLES] You guys should save yourselves. Grab those tanks. What? Trust me. TumTum, grab the tape and a hammer. [BEEPING] [MEN CHATTERING EXCITEDLY] [MEN LAUGHING] You made it. MEDUSA: Help me up, you idiots. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. One instant torpedo. TumTum, hammer. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] Let's get out of here. [♪♪♪] Adiós, Mega Mountain. [ALL LAUGH] Jump! [ALL SCREAM] [BEEPING RAPIDLY] [PANTING] COPS: Freeze! [GUNS COCK] [WHIMPERS] [CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICK] REPORTER: Well, it seems the drama here at Mega Mountain is over. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Hey, it has come to our attention these are the boys who single-handedly foiled the terrorists' plans. Is this true? Kids! ALL: Dad. TUMTUM: Grandpa. How are you? SAM: Okay. GRANDPA: Hello, hello, hello. You must be quite proud of your heroes. JESSICA: Well... Actually, if you want the real hero... He's over there. Dave Dragon. Dave, our sources tell us that in lieu of the day's events the network is considering signing you to a new long-term contract. Can you comment on that? I'm always happy to oblige my fans. That's great news. Off the record, Dave, you know, I've always been a great fan. So, uh, just another typical day at the park, huh, boys? Yeah. Pretty boring, I guess. You know, I think we might need another summer at ninja camp. You know, in case we get a little rusty. We might even have a new recruit. JESSICA: Oh. You think you can handle it? Piece of cake. Speaking of cake. SAM: Ooh. Ah-ha. JESSICA: Whoa!
