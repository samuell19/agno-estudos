Good morning, Pastor Pripp. Good morning, Ole and Nik. Good morning, Pastor Pripp. Good morning, Anker. - Do you want to go in the water, Anker? - Unfortunately, I do not have time, Rosa. - It's a sweet girl, huh? - Yes. It is now strange that the priest only have girls. - There must be errors in the mechanics. - Nikolaj! And they all have flower names. - I thought of them. - Not all of them. Rosa, Viola, Jasmine, Iris and Marguerit. - And Amarylis. - Yes, you came up with the weird name. Think when the poor girl grows up and a young man embraces her - and says, "I love you, Amarylis." So I do not want you to kiss me. He does not want it! Do you also have a name for the new one that is on the way? I have one: Xenia. But then they damn well have to stop. What is that. Are you going to war? I think you have the cannon with you. I've been after a fox that has taken 30 of the landlord's chickens. - Did you get it? - Yes. It's in the bag here. - Do you want to sell it? - What do you want with a dead fox? - Mind your own business. - Now I know! It's for Marie. It's no use, little Ole. She does not want you anyway. Hold your quay. You have no understanding of women. - Here you go. You can have it. - Thank you very much, Mr Stud Meister. Congratulations. It's a good position you've got. Now you are responsible for all the landlord's fine galloping horses. I like working with horses. They are some lovely animals. Well, I have to move on. Goodbye. Goodbye. Have you seen the landowner today? Yes, he's down by the pond to catch crayfish. I do not understand that anyone eats that little crap. They remind me of spiders. We better look to get started. - Marie? - Yes. Now I will be there. - See. - Has the landowner been lucky? Yes, they are big this year. Here is a good 150. Now remember that they need to be cooked with lots of dill and sugar. - Will happen. - Marie? - Where's my sister? - Mrs. Helene? Just before, she was standing in the hall, phoning her son at least 10 mins ago. Then she's probably still standing there. Marie? - What do you think of the new maid? - Erna? She is fairly good. She just needs to be sanded off a bit. Then sand away, Marie. Sand away. - Are you done in the living rooms? - Yes. You, Marie. It is not quite normal here in the house. Now the old lady who lives in the wing... The landowner's aunt? Aunt Thyra? She then says the strangest things. She has a habit of thinking out loud. The first time we met, she said to me: "They're really a nice young girl." "What a little mocha!" Yes, she's not completely crazy. Crayfish! Shall we have them for dinner? No, they are for later. The priest comes to l'hombre. Hurry up! The landlord's sister is coming. Well, here you are. - Do you have a watch? - Yes. - Do you ever look at it? - Yes. My aunt should have had her cocoa a quarter of an hour ago. You have to shape up. We are very precise here in the house, - - and I'm responsible for it all. - I cannot do everything at once. - It is not required either. You just have to be where you need to be when you need to be there. What do they need crayfish for? The landlord wants them tonight instead of tea and slices. Yes. Yes. (Erna whines) There's one running after me! Go away with you! Do not howl. They are quite harmless little ones. Come and help, Erna. No, I do not dare. Stop making a scene of yourself, Erna. (Helene whines) Come on, take it from me, Marie. Yes. Yes. Take it easy. Now I have to be there. What a vicious little chatter. But they taste good. It was nice you could come. - You've let us down lately. - I was just about to cancel. We're expecting a little one in the Priest Farm. My wife was not feeling well. It's about just above as they say. - Number seven? - Yes, and we're both looking forward to it. Children are a blessing. How is your son? Torben? He is studying to become a lawyer in Copenhagen, and he is struggling with it. Yes, but with what? Drink your schnapps, Aunt Thyra. Have you not forgotten to take your nerve pills? Yes, because I had no more sherry. - They do not take pills with sherry, do they? - What else should you take them with? What the hell does that concern the Priest? It's always a pleasure to see you, Aunt Thyra. In the same way, Pastor Pripp. How cute is he? You just had to be 50 years younger. - You must have gotten an admirer. - It seems so. Well, shall we drink out? Cheers! It's getting late. Do you not want to go over to yourself, Aunt Thyra? How sweet and thoughtful you are, Helene. The insidious snake. - Goodnight. Goodnight. - Good night. Good night. Shall we go in to me, Pripp? - Yes. Thanks for here. - Bon appetite. - Get yourself a cigar, Pripp. - Thanks. - We need to talk, Martin. - Oh. Isn't it soon 15 years ago your daughter left? Run off, do you mean? You know I do not want to talk about it. - Have you not heard from her at all? - No. She chose to leave her home with a runaway artist. I gave her the choice: him or me. And she chose him. Blinded and stubborn as she was. Have you not tried to contact her? I once wrote a letter to her, but she did not reply to me. Why should we talk about it now? Where do you want to go with all that? Have you not read about the plane that crashed in Switzerland? Yes, fleeting... I'm sorry to have to tell you, Martin... ... but your daughter and her husband were among the casualties. I got the message from the Chief of Police. Knowing we are old friends, he thought I should tell you. These papers confirm it. Then that chapter is over... No, Martin. It is not. You obviously do not know that you have a grandchild. - A grandchild? - Yes. A boy. Louise left behind a boy. - What's up, Martin? Are you getting ill? - Give me a glass of water. It's just the heart. It's over immediately. Just keep going. According to the report, his Italian father had no family. And what then? What are you trying to say? That you have to take care of him. - Me? - Yes. He only has you. - Well, I can not... - Let me speak out. He only has you. He stays at the circus in Milan where his father worked. You cannot let him stay there. I'm an older man. I'm not well. What do I do with a child I do not feel anything for? I understand well, it's hard after what happened. But it's not the boy's fault. There's no way around it, Martin. You have to do something. He can be sent to Copenhagen, and then you have to pick him up there. Not me! So let me get him. Good. As you want. I would like a conversation with Copenhagen. Eva 159. Hello. Is that you, Torben? Good evening, mother. I cannot hear what you're saying. I just turn down the radio. No! I sit all alone and read. What do you want? Are you sure about that? Could it not be a mistake? It's a damn good story. Of course I'm coming. I'm driving early tomorrow. Yes! Bye mom. - Did you lose anything, honey? - Maybe an estate for several millions. You are so sweet: full of lies! (the doorbell rings) - Are you expecting anyone? - Just a couple of friends from the gallop track. - Who are they? - No one you know. They are bookmakers. God! Do you play with them? Is that not illegal? There's so much that is. Good evening. (whistles for the girl) Hey, hey. You've got visitors tonight. We must not disturb either. - We'll come after that deposit. - It's dead sure. I could only get half now. You know, I'm good for the rest. Do not make it a habit. You already have debt. - Are you coming to the race tomorrow? - Unfortunately. I'm going down to the estate and talk to my uncle. What luck that you have that uncle. We're off. Greet the baby doll. Bye, bye, darling. There was a virgin She owned mansion and gold However, in her heart she loved a young man But her father said I do not allow it (whistles) Hey, hey. What is that supposed to be? Look there! Good morning, Rosa. - Good morning, you two. - Good morning. The stork has been past the Priest Farm. Mom is well. You do not guess what happened. - A girl, of course. - Shot past. - Then a boy finally came. - No. There came two! - Boys? - Twins? - Is it not wonderful? - I think it's a disaster. What should we call them? Flowers do not have boy names. We can call one "foal" and the other "foot." - How smart are you? - Or "spruce" and "cone." Shut up! - You must not become enemies. - All his banter and chatter. I suddenly get an idea. Listen here. Are you following? We're taking the royal line from the front. First comes Gorm the Old and then Harald Bluetooth. Later we take him Svend. - Svend Comfort? - No, Forkbeard. Sweyn Forkbeard, for hell. You'll probably have to talk to Dad about that. I guess I better get going. - Are you going out driving with Aunt Thyra? - Yes. She's sweet, and I'm earning a little. - That's fine. - And keep peace, you two. No quarrel! What the hell did she mean by that? We never argue. Only you hold the quay and do as I please. - Go and spray. - Yes. Yes. Your cod! Your big damn clapper! Stop it, you big planer! But god! Did you get wet? You have to apologize a lot for that. Great bastard! - Good morning, Your grace. - Good morning, you rascal. God knows what he wants. - Good morning, Rosa. - Good morning. You get prettier and prettier each time I see you. I dare not come here any more soon. So stay away! There is no one who has sent bids for that squat. Your new car is probably nice. Do you think? - Do you want to go out for a ride one evening? - I would like that. - Are you staying here long? - It depends on so much. - Goodbye, your grace. - Goodbye. - See you. - See you. - It's a bad surprise. - Who knew she had a child? You said I was the closest heir to the estate. You've been too since Louise renounced her inheritance. What changes it then that the kid suddenly shows up? I do not know, and it makes me so nervous. - Have you talked to the old man about it? - No, I don't dare. You know how tempered he is. Yesterday he had a heart attack. It could end up killing him. - Then all problems would be solved. - Torben though! Imagine for a second you were cheated out of a million inheritage by a foreign brat. I thought my future was secured for years. Have you seen the paper in which Louise waived her right of inheritance? No. At that time we did not live here. But Aunt Thyra has told me that. Louise came home from music studies in Paris - - and said she would marry an artist. An aerial acrobat! Italians! - It did not suit the old man. - He was out of his mind by rage. He shouted: "I'll never allow it! Such a wandering gypsy!" "He's just taking you for the money." Louise just looked cold at him. She said she wanted to prove it was not true. For none of them wanted his damned money. A lawyer came with a document in which she waived her right of inheritance. Since then, they have not seen each other. If it's really the case, as you say, - - then the boy has no legal right. - Thank God. Are you sure? - Yes. But the old man must not be too happy for the boy. - What do you mean? - That my uncle can cancel the paper. And write a new will in which the little idiot gets the right of inheritance. It's awful. What should we do? - Suffocate him! That would be easiest. - What if someone heard you, Torben. Take it easy. There are probably other options. - What do you think you're doing? - Flags for the landowner's grandchildren. - Don't. He's not welcome. - What? In the kitchen, they say he's not welcome. My God, poor boy. There he is, the vicious one. Up with the flag! - Well, you said... - Hold your quay, and then pull and hoist. - Pull and hoist. - Hurry up now. Pull and hoist! Can you see, that was a good idea I got with the flag? Before hell! Wait a minute here. I just need to announce our arrival. Then you can come. Here we are. So it's your grandfather. Thanks for letting me come. You speak Danish, I hear. I always spoke Danish with my... ... with my mother. - What's your name? - Martin. - Like you. - I see. Your name is Martin... ... like me. Yes. I'm your aunt Helene. And that's my son Torben. I hope you settle in here. Although it will not be easy for you to be barging into a new place. Martin probably knows how to behave, - - even though he comes from a completely different kind of people. You must be tired after the long journey. - What's up, Erna? - Should I carry the suitcases up to the guest room? Yes. And show the boy the way. Is that not a nice boy? - He looked somewhat southern. - He probably looks like his father on a dot. He has his mother's beautiful blue eyes. Not true, Martin? Yes. It's nice here, huh? - Who are those two? - It's Ole and Nik. They are gardeners. (Ole and Nik hum) They've been here a long time. - Have you also? - I'm not that old either. Over there in the side wing lives Aunt Thyra. You should go visit her. - Visit? Is she not coming over here? - Only on special occasions. I do not think she likes Mrs Helene. - Oh? - I cannot either. - Other than that, it's nice here. - Yes. Tomorrow I will get up early and look at it all. - Can you handle yourself? - Yes. Thanks. I guess we don't need to be afraid of that boy. Did you see your uncle yesterday at dinner? He was well annoyed when the boy told about the circus life. His enormous admiration for his father did not fall into good soil either. But when he told that Louise appeared in the manege wearing sequins, - playing on a white grand piano and illuminated by red and green lamps, - - I thought my uncle would get up and go. Hard, especially when you know that she has been taught by the best music educators. Let's just give the kid free rein. Maybe he's ruining it for himself. Otherwise, I have a plan that can not fail. At least he's gone one way or another. - Good morning. - Good morning. Where's the boy? Can he not keep the meals time? - He's not that precise. - He's probably lying and oozing. No, he does not. He was down early and eating breakfast in the kitchen. That's probably where he's best. - Martin? - Yes. - Do you know what you want to do with him? - Not yet. At your age, it's hard to take care of a boy. Think about your health and your poor heart. Thank you, Helene. I will probably have to take a position on that matter myself. Booh! Bravo! - Do you want to join the stables? - Yes. - Are you Anker? - Yes. - My name is martin. - Like your grandfather! Si, si, senor. - Do you speak Italian? - Only when I'm mad. - Is it good to scold? - It sounds much worse than Danish. It's a newborn foal. It's a lovely little one. Bellisimo, bellisimo. - Is it not going to his mother? - She must first calm down a little. I guess it was good I found you. I'm the priest's daughter, Rosa. Dad asks if you want to visit us. We have a small orchestra and you have an instrument with you, right? A guitar. Pick it up and then come down to the Preist Farm. - He looks like a smart guy. - Yes. What do you say to a bike ride tonight, Rosa? Unfortunately. I promised to take a ride with Torben. Maybe another time? Let me give you a piece of advice: Stay away from that guy. Thank you very much, but I can probably take care of myself, you see. Then sit down. Then we begin. (there is a knock on the door) Come in. - Good day. - Hello, Martin. Welcome, my boy. Come and say hello to my daughters. My little flowers, as I call them. Viola. Jasmine. Marguerite. Iris. Now say what your name is. Let's hear now. Amarylis. Surely you must also greet my sons. Well, there they are. Come and show your boys, Anna. It's Martin I've told you about. Welcome. I hope you will come here very often. (child crying) Good voices, right Martin? They are already taking the high C. Dikkedik, dikkedik. Enough watching, but not touching. What should they be called? The one on the left will be named Gorm, and the one on the right will be Harald. Or it's the other way around. - We must not disturb anymore. - In place, girls. We're rehearsing on something we want to play for your grandfather, - - when he soon turns 70 years old. Sit down now, Martin. And play along if you feel like it. Let's get started. One, two! (Amarylis plays a false tone) But Amarylis. You played false. I also wrote a text for the song. - Do you want to hear it, Martin? - Yes, thanks. There is birdsong and the bees are buzzing all day long until the sun goes down but when all happy voices are silenced beats the heart of anticipation for we know There's a new day on the way with sun and summer for you and me there is a new time on the way with new joys for you and me Are you tired and sad when the day is over have you forgotten that you can smile and laugh do you not think there is anything about anything roll up the curtain one morning and watch There's a new day on the way with sun and summer for you and me there is a new time on the way with new joys for you and me Everyone is looking forward to Saturday and Sunday Monday morning, that few likes but I just think it's so nice to know this when an evening is over There's a new day on the way with sun and summer for you and me there is a new time on the way with new joys for you and me - I'm terribly sorry! - What's up, Anna? I forgot you're having a wedding this morning. - What time? - In six minutes. What should we do? - Then I have to get dressed. - We'll help you, Dad. - My black shoes. - I'm getting them. I'll take it. Lace up dad's shoes. - I can too. - No, you cannot. - Here are your black shoes. - I'm taking them. - Come with them. - Oops! - Off, it's squeezing. - It's the wrong one. - Here you go, Dad. - Thanks. - Where's the sleeve? - Now I have to button. - The collar? - Here you go. (church bells) - They're started, Dad. - Nothing happens before I come. - Take your bike. - It's punctured. You're welcome to borrow my bike. You better take mine. Thank you, everybody. It is convenient to have many girls. Yes. Well, I have to hurry. Goodbye, everyone. Thank God I thought of that. - Now I think, Dad make it. - He forgot his glasses. (church bells) (the wedding march is heard from the church) - Take it easy, it's just me. - They had almost killed me. Gladly. Where should I button up? - They must be a bad one, huh? - Do you think? - Are you afraid of men, Erna? - No. But I decide for myself who I want to kiss. (the phone is ringing) - It's the phone. - Yes. - It's ringing. - Yes. (there is a knock on the door) - Come in. - There's a phone call from Copenhagen for you. - From Copenhagen? - He said it was important. Yes? Here? Are you here? I don't want you to go up to the main building. Let's meet in the park... Yes, down by the gate. Okay, so we're saying that. Goodbye. - Great place, huh? - Not bad. - Is he doing it? - That's good enough. - We have a clamp on him. - You can say that. There he comes. - Just let me have the floor. - Okay. You know I do not want you to seek me out here. Calm down, buddy. Hear what we have to say to you. It's about one of your uncle's horses. - Spartacus. - It is the big favorite in the cup race. - And what then? - We have a brand good scam. I have a sea of ​​customers who will probably play on Spartacus. - But wait, it did not win. - We would make a lot of money on that. - And now sit down, it's a winner. - Here you show up, brother. You have to make sure that the horse does not win. - You have to give it something. - I do not want to destroy that horse. Do not destroy it. It just does not have to win that race. Here is a syringe and an ampoule with a sleeping pill. Could it be easier? And what's the matter with me in the noble affair? We want to show ourselves from our most beautiful side - - and draw a line over the amount you owe us. - I do not promise anything. - I would now advise you to do so. Otherwise, I'll talk to your uncle about his signature on your promissory note. - It is he who has signed? - Of course. - I'm doing what I can. - Nice guy. See you on Saturday for the race. - What do you think of Spartacus? - It's in great shape. Horse of all time. If he wins, you must have a coach bonus, so take good care of him. The landlord can be quite calm. He wins! (Marie hums) - Hey, Marie. - Hello. - Do you give a cup of coffee? - You can believe it. - Hi Anker. You look so happy. - So am I. Do you not know that he has moved into the small house over by North Forest? - The forest runner's house? - Yes. The landlord gave me a good offer. It's been pretty neat. I just need curtains. I have to buy them when I have time. I'd probably like to see you steer around with that house all alone. And what about the food? If you then get something. - You should go find yourself a wife. - It's probably worth considering. One should not take the first the first, best bimbo one encounters on his way. Yes, it is not easy to find the right one. Or you cannot see the forest for just trees. However, it could be avoided. I have to move on. Look in if you want to see how I live. I would like that. Another one might not be welcome? Surely you are so, Erna. Come whenever you want. Well, I do then. Now I never have! Are you sitting there lazying it off? - What do you come for yourself? - We could smell your coffee. So sit down and have a cup. It's lying there. - Are you already leaving? - Yes, I'm busy. - Thanks for the coffee, Marie. - You're welcome. You can look him up in the directory. He is occupied. As long as he does not have a smooth ring on, the competition is free. Aunt Thy is sitting down in the park, Erna. I could imagine you're furiously frozen, Marie. And what are you going to do about it? Since it's worst with the cold around the neck and down, so... So what? - He wants to suggest something to you, Marie. - It's dawned on me. - Well, you misunderstood me. - See? Do not you freeze just such a tiny bit? No. If you now went out on an icy winter night, - - where the rain piss... whipped down and the storm hissed, then you would freeze. No, because then I would stay home. - Then take it. - It's a gift, Marie. Well Ole though! I shot it myself. Yes, almost. Cross in the backpack where it suits you, Marie. Lift your beard, bette Ole. You should have a kiss for that anyway. See for yourself, you big head. Torben! Hurry up to open the window. The boy is sitting in the garden playing for Aunt Thy and your uncle. I'm afraid the boy will gain a foothold with his grandfather. We will prevent that. Bravo, my boy. You really play really well. How about a little number more? - A little song, maybe? - Do you really want to hear more? You just play for your grandfather. He benefits from hearing something beautiful, the old goat. I know a little song I learned from my mother. A little forgotten Italian serenade the sound of the guitar will tell you about a little song I heard on a street an evening in the lovely Rome In the old days, there were too many years left a serenade from each a young man to the modern girl I would like to say give yourself some time to listen to it a little A little forgotten Italian serenade I hum it when I meet you Everything today is so rushed the heart is too self-absorbed That which for me has caused that I can smile again is quite simple A little forgotten Italian serenade the sound of the guitar will tell you about a little song I heard on a street an evening in the lovely Rome In the old days, there were too many years ago a serenade from each a young man to the modern girl I would like to say give yourself some time to listen to it a little A little forgotten Italian serenade I hum it when I meet you Beautiful! Really nice! I have to say that. If you want to take a ride with Torben, he is by the garages. - I would like to. - Hurry up. - We'll take care of your guitar. - Thanks. How hot it is today, though. It was a gorgous hat, though. Where did you dust it up? It really suits you! Our Lord is preserved, such she looks. I was actually waiting for you. - I need to talk to you. - Oh. We are in a family. - It's a shame how they treat you. - What do you mean? - Do you like being here? - Everything is so new. Would you rather not go back to Italy and the people you know? - Do you have connections down there? - My father's two partners. They offered to train me to be an acrobat. They said I had good facilities. Your grandfather was persuaded to bring you to Denmark. He would rather have been free of you. I do not believe that. Why would he be free of me? You look like your father. The old man has never forgiven him for running away from your mother. I'm proud to look like my dad. He was the finest man in the world. Your grandfather will never realize it. - I'm talking to him. - I would advise against that. - He's very stubborn. - So am I. I'm sorry to tell you, Martin... ... but he does not like you. Maybe I should not have said that, but I thought you should know. I would like to get off. Listen to my advice, Martin. Go quietly with the doors, - - and do nothing without asking me for advice. (Martin sulks) Let me go, Torben. - Stop. It's not funny. - Who says it has to be? - You may not have been kissed before? - No. And I do not feel like it either. It's the two of us to decide. - Let me go or I'm screaming. - Nobody can hear us anyway. It's something you think. Let her go then. Anker. It was just for fun. So is this. My God, it was nothing. Why become enemies over it though? Anker! - Is it getting better? - Yes. I really do not have to lie down. It was a proper one he gave me. You were right. I had no idea Torben was like that. It was good you came. Does the sun bother you? You should have some curtains. I know. I just did not have time to buy anyone. - Rosa? - Yes. There's something I want to ask you. (there is a knock on the door) Now I have to see who it is. - Is he dead? - No, he isn't. We heard he had been killed. Then we hurried here to see if it was true. Just go in and talk to him. I brought flowers just in case. - More coffee? - No thanks, Marie. - Where's Torben? - He went out riding early this morning. Good morning. Good morning, my boy. Sit down and have some breakfast. Thank you, I have eaten. It's a weird moody boy, though. I think it's gotten worse the last few days. It's hard to get to know him. I do not know at all if he likes to be here. I think about him day and night, and it makes me irritable. Yesterday I tried to talk about his mother, - but met a wall of steady silence. It's a shame for you, Martin. You should send him back to where he came from. That would be a bankruptcy declaration. You do not send your grandchild away! One should probably be able to house break such a puppy. - Martin? - Yes. - Do you want a ride? - Yes. - Are you used to horses? - I've ridden a lot. Although it was mostly in the manege. But what does Grandpa say? Do not think about it. If there is rubbish, I say I allowed you. - What is it called? - Prince. - A moment. - Hello, Pastor Pripp. Did you lure the boy out on a horseback ride with that horse? Lured is now so much said. He begged me for it. - Strange sounds drive it crazy. - He'll probably make it. If anything happens to the boy, it is your responsibility. Remember it. By the way... Stay away from my daughter. (thunder) (a thunderclap) Calm down, Prince. Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Go away, Prince! Go away, Prince! Go away! You've been out riding, I hear. Shouldn't you have asked me for permission? - What? - Yes, but... Nothing but. Shouldn't you have asked me? Yes. It's my favorite horse. It could have been hurt. You need to change your behavior significantly if you want to stay here. Go up to your room and think about what I said. (Martin swears in Italian) I'm taking the first shift. Replace me at three o'clock. - Is it necessary? - I have a strange feeling. I'm worried about that horse. Preferrably nothing were to happen before the race. - Good night. I arrive at three o'clock. - It is fine. Just turn off the light, Pedersen. Stop! - Anker! Are you here? - Turn on the light! - Did you see a guy run out of here? - Yes. - Did you see who it was? - No. There, there. See what I found on the floor. I wonder who has an interest in this here. Who do you think it was? I have no evidence, so we better keep quiet. But I'll not get it out of sight until it's on the field tomorrow. He should have been here a long time ago. He does not dare to stay away. As long as he does not burn us off. The race is coming soon. Yes, that's right, Torben. Turn on the television. I thought you were gone to the race. The ticker made a fuss this morning, - - so I'd rather see it on the screen. - Now I'm going to take a chair for you. - Thanks. Thanks. By the way, Spartacus is safe. It has only happened before that an outsider has won a race. The field is now on the last long side and Spartacus is still leading. It has taken the lead from the start. Its shape is radiant and it rides masterfully. At the moment it's threatened by Bella, - - but there is no doubt that it has many powers yet. It masters the field. Then there is the last turn. Spartacus is clearly ahead. It is again in the winning position. A magnificent horse. Then comes the last 100 meters. Spartacus leads superiorly, it certainly wins. Here it passes the target. Now Spartacus, now Bella, now Hero... Well! What did I say? Yes, you were right as always... ... dear uncle. - He cheated us. - He's going to regret it. (the phone is ringing) Yes? I thought it was you. I know, but it was completely hopeless. I tried to call you before the race. It's good with you, brother. We need to have a serious talk, so just roll out the runner. We will be with you in a few hours. - We're driving down there. - Did you catch him? (Ole and Nikolaj hum) - Ole? - What is it? Lend me your tobacco pouch. - Did you not bring your own? - I forgot it. It's becoming a habit that you forget your tobacco pouch. - But only a small stop. - Hiss! - What? - A carriage is coming. Howdy. Who is it? What kind of pair of riff-raff is that? Nik! Tell them that access is forbidden here. There comes the landowner's nephew. Skilled work, brother. You did well. I did what I could... Clap in and give us the thrills you owe us and it can't go too fast. - I'll get that money. - Yes, and within three days. Otherwise, your uncle is hanging on to the promissory note he has signed. - Because he has, right? - I've said that. That is, Wednesday before 12 o'clock. Do not forget. I would advise you to do that. - Did you hear what they said? - Every single word. What a rascal! - Which one of them? - All three of them. Our Lord preserved. - Is that you, Erna? - Yes, it's what it looks like. There was no one home, but I went in anyway. I do not hope you get mad at me. - But those were the curtains. - Have you set up curtains at me? That was a sweet thought. I even sewed them for you. You do the worst things when you are in love. I hope then, the chosen one knows how lucky he is. Surely he does not. He's both blind and deaf in that regard. It's to hoot over how inattentive he is. - What a doofus. - Yes, you're right. Do you like the living room with curtains? I'm sorry, Erna... ... but there's something I have to tell you. You do not have to say anything. That was stupid of me. (a door opens) Sorry. I did not know you had a visit. So run after her, you big cod. Rosa! Rosa! Rosa! You must listen to me. Rosa! - I know what's in the package. - Really? - Can I look? - Yes, here you go. - I have sewn them myself. - How beautiful they are. But now I do not know where to hang. I do. Where I see them early in the morning and late in the evening. - In your bedroom? - Exactly. (the rustle in the bush) Watch out for someone coming! - I need another one. - One for me too. Thank you, my girl. Ah, buns! Mom has baked buns! Calm down, children. Sit down, otherwise you will not get any at all. Are you going to eat all the buns yourself? Now not nosy, little miss. Here you go. You neatly take one at a time. Listen, where's Martin? We have not seen him for several days. Have you seen anything of him, children? - I know where he is. - I know that too. He has taken a job at the Linde Farm. Work? - Yes, he helps with the harvest. - He saves together for something. - Does he do it? - He's going home to Italy. To Italy? I see. How do you know that? He himself has said that. He is my amigo. - She's completely red in the head! - Oh, how stupid you are! Take another bun and run out and play. Wait for me. - Do you think he's thinking of traveling? - I do not know. I hoped he had settled in with his grandfather. Where is Rosa by the way? At the stud. She has begun to take an interest in horses. For horses? Oh! I see. Anker is also a nice young man. - One do not disturb, does one? - No. Come inside though. - Do not want a cup of tea? - Tea? No, preferrably not. The boy is not here? I thought he was playing here every day. He did too... ... but now the girls say he has taken a job at the Linde Farm. What does he have? At the Linde Farm? - I thought you knew that. - No. He helps with the fall. It is then fine to want to earn a penny. - To what? - Your birthday, maybe. - That would damn well surprise me a lot. - The children say he wants to travel. - Trevel? - Yes. Back to Italy. So why did he not ask me for money? He's probably too proud. I have to get him. He's not going to make fun of me. I ride with him so he does not get too angry. - Do it. - Just take my hat. (car horn) What's the point of this? Do you want to make me a laughing stock? What do you mean, Grandpa? I get a good salary for helping farm owner Mikkelsen with the harvest. Get in the carriage immediately. I cannot stand any more nonsense with you. I cannot do as you say. I have been bound for three days. They are counting on my help and I am keeping my promise. I'm sorry to run now. I'm busy. There you see! I know no one more stubborn than that boy. I certainly do. His grandfather, for example. You have to admit, he's difficult. He makes fun of me in the eyes of the people. You seem to be looking completely wrong at that case, dear friend. He's a real little man you should be proud of. - Do you mean it? - You got him wrong in the throat. In fact, you like each other a lot. - I even think he admires you. - I wonder? The crazy thing is, you both need each other. And maybe he feels lonely. He loses his parents and comes to a country - - with people he's never met before. I think he needs you and your love very much, Martin. Maybe you're right. Now I think we two need a drink. - Here you go. - Thanks. Is not it a little strong? Can your heart now handle it? I've not had it so so good for a long time. - Cheers, old friend. - Cheers. I've been thinking about what you said, Pripp. I have to talk to the boy when he gets home tonight. He does not have to travel. He belongs here with me. You have no idea how happy I am, Martin. (there is a knock on the door) Yes? Anker would like to talk to the landowner. Let him in. Sorry, I'm bothering you. Get closer. I just got paid for the earring we sold the other day. 7,000 straight out. In large banknotes. The money and the bills are here. - Thanks. - Will the landowner not count? I'll do that. - Shall we not enjoy the weather in the garden? - Yes, let's do it. It's nice to see the landlord in such a good mood. Too bad the boy is not home for dinner. They work until late in the evening to get the harvest in house. - Good evening. - Well, there you are. It's late, huh? Yes, but we got what we needed. - Are there guests here? The whole house is lit. - Yes. Your grandfather's lawyer is here. He must arrange some documents. - Where are you going? - Get some letterhead. Have you gotten a little girlfriend? No. I have to write to some friends in Milan. - That you are traveling back to Italy? - No, I'm staying here, little Marie. Hurry, the food is ready. They're done right up there. The coffee must be served on the terrace. What are you doing here? Nothing. I'm just looking for an envelope. - Did you find one? - No, I'm waiting until tomorrow. Come on, everyone. Now we need coffee. Thanks, it's going to be great. - It was nice you could come. - Thank you for a wonderful dinner. I think I am getting a little tipsy of that port wine. How stuffy it is is tonight. A shame, my grandson is not here, but he has overtime. It's good that someone in the family is making money. Just get the cigars, Torben. Nah, let me rather myself. I have some extra nice ones. Bravo, bravo. Martin? Is there something wrong? They are gone. The money is gone. The 7,000 crowns I put here this afternoon. - Could someone have stolen them? - Who should it be, though? - Why are they not in the safe? - I should have. I did not have the key on me, and then I forgot. We are only ourselves. Marie has been here for 16 years and Erna has just returned from the weekend. - Martin? - Yes. When I came in to turn on the light, the boy was rummaging in the desk. - Impossible. - Yes, he did. - He has not come home yet. - Yes, he is. - I had not thought so anyway. - Shut up, Helene. It cannot be him. I do not want it to be him. Go out to the others, and do not mention this to anyone, understand? - Yes. - Go then. I want to be a little alone. Answer me honestly. Did you take money from your uncle's desk? Money? What are you talking about? Has money disappeared? Thank God. I could not believe that about you either. - Where did Martin go? - Now I'm going to get him. Where are you with those cigars? But Martin! Martin! Erna! Come on, come on. The landlord has had a heart attack. Call the doctor from the phone in the hall. - Mrs. Helene? - Yes. Their brother has become ill. Martin! It is from NaesbyFarm. Can the doctor come right away? Is he not home? They must finally say that it is urgent. Yes... Yes, thanks. - Do you want a soda? - Yes, thanks. - Does it taste good? - Nice, Marie. - What's wrong, Erna? - Your grandfather has become ill, Martin. - Ill? - He's had a bad incident. I have put him to bed and I have called the doctor. - Where do you think you're going? - To my grandfather. Move! You stay here. Get away from that door! I want in! I'm going in! What in the world is the point? You make your grandfather sicker with that noise. Off you go. I've never known anything like it. Close the door, Torben. We preferrably shouldn't have the kid to the old man right now. Grandfather. Grandpa, it's me. Is that you, Martin? You do not get sick, do you? I mean, really seriously ill. I'll be so lonely if you... You'll get well again, right? We need to get along so well together. So, so, my boy. - Martin? - Yes. Do you know of any money that was lying in my desk? Lots of money. No, Grandpa. I do not know what money you are talking about. That's good, my boy. How did you get in? I told you to stay out. - Now let the boy be. - Now comes the doctor, Martin. - Good evening. - Good evening. Are we now going to have nonsense with the old heart again, dear friend? Out with you! - How did he get in? - Through the window, I suppose. Stay away from your grandfather's room. You've made him sorrow enough. I? You probably know the 7,000 that were stolen from him. - I did not take them. - Of course not. Up on your room! You'll probably need a good story tomorrow when the police arrive. You're both really disgusting! Am I wrong? No. But it is obvious he is shocked to be discovered. It's a shame how they treat that boy. We have to help him. He cannot do it alone. It should not be that difficult. I would love to give that rascal a proper dip. - Who are you talking about? - Torben, the dirty boy. It is he who has snatched the money. - Do you think so? - I know. It must be proven. Me and Nik even heard that the two scammers from Copenhagen - should have the money tomorrow at 12 o'clock. Otherwise, they would gossip to the landowner about the signature. And today is the day before the day, so he really has to hurry. You say something, Nik. Imagine if he runs off to Copenhagen tonight. And once the money is out of the house, it's going to be hard to snatch him. Come on, Nik. We must have the long leg in front. - Is the boy going with? - Do you want to come, Martin? - He is sleeping. - You can go. Martin stays here. - Satan too! Now he's slipping away. - Shall we beat him down? There is telephone. It's from Copenhagen. Lend me your knife. - Where is it? Here! - And go out and watch. - watch what? - That no one is coming, doofus. Yes? I just want to remind you that it's tomorrow Wednesday at 12 o'clock. Yes, and today is Tuesday. You can be quite calm. The amount of interest should probably be in your hands on time. Goodbye. Idiot. (air leaks out of the tire) (noise from the metal teeth) (meow) 14 of the big ones! What did I say? I hope he's stopped by the traffic police. - Why? - His driver's license is here. Yesterday I did not think I should experience this day. So it's not that strange that I'm grateful right now, - where I really got something to live for. That's why I think you should know. The heir to Naesby Farm is here. Martin... my grandchild. Really congratulations, my boy. It will rub Helene the wrong way. That is not correct. It can not be legal! Dear Mrs. Helene. It's legal. You can not treat my son that way. He's not who you think he is. You're blind when it comes to Torben. Congratulations, Uncle Martin. And sorry, I'm coming so late. It's just you I miss. Come here. I was kept by the traffic police for quite some time. - You were missing your driver's license, weren't you? - Yes. It's in this wallet. - It's yours, right? - Yes. There is also 7,000 crowns. 7,000 that you stole from me. Torben! But that's not the worst. It's unforgivable that you let the boy take the blame. Just keep the money. You must really need them. One moment. Needless to say, you are not welcome at Neasby Farm. You can be quite calm. It's sewn in. If you throw Torben out, I'll go too. You do not have to, Helene. You can stay if you want. Dear friend. We would like to congratulate you and all the best in the future. Long live the landowner! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! - And then the long. - Yes. And then the long. Hooray! Thank you, dear friends.
