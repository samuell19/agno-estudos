Uh, Gene I just want to make a statement all right? Jack would you get their relatives in behind me? I just want to say that we don't know for sure that there's anything wrong in Jonestown now we've had various reports that some members of Jim Jones congregation are virtual prisoners these members of the community who have relatives in Guyana want to go down there and show their concern for these reports and ask their loved ones if they want to come home I think we'll know for sure tomorrow I hope meanwhile I think it would be wise if the media and all the rest of us would not spread any rumors or gossip about the People's Temple until we know what the facts actually are Thank You. Congressman Ryan about how many US citizens are there in Jonestown? our best guess is about a thousand had their Has their embassy there been in contact with you? I presume so. is it true that social security checks are going directly to the temple bank accounts? Jim? (Sighs) Jim, congressman and the reporters have taken off in San Francisco We have to get things in order. OK... "Man, who was born of woman, has but a short time to live."

"Will you tell me a Bible story?" *Chuckles* Honey you know all those stories by heart! the way you tell them makes them better than a movie! "They are better because they're real!!!" this the fountain of all truth and wisdom *Deep Sigh* In the ancient land of Egypt, a cruel emperor, called the Pharaoh occupied the throne and in that land they worshipped all kinds strange gods like cats and birds things like that... "and within that land... Moses first appeared." Oh! I'm so proud of you son, seeing you give yourself to Christ hearing you speak your first words for him. oh I can't say how exciting it was! I guess I'm proud too. But humble and grateful. "That's right! You let others be proud." Think I might be a preacher when I grow up? Like minister Kennedy?

"You take that boy of yours and go down to nigger town!" *Slaps* *Screams* Get outta my way you Psalm signin' little creep! I want you to take this. And I want you to put everything you own in it. Because we gonna get the hell out of here and you and me ain't coming back so pack it full honey! And let's get! I want you to get the outside of these buildings painted.

[After Her ;)] Jim! Marcy!? you believe in me don't you? Well of course I do! I can't do what I'm trying to do alone. I need you. yeah I need people who believe in him. Believe in the gospel I'm trying to preach... But I need you more than anyone. *Gulps* I want you to marry me Marcy. Be my life's companion. Therefore shall a man cleave unto his wife and they shall be of one flesh. Will ya? I don't know, look I'm older than you are you haven't finished school yet and you don't know what you want! I've always known what I wanted, from the first time I sat on Myrtle Kennedy's knee and she over the gates of the world of faith to me, and put me on the path to God! I want you to make the journey with me Marcy. Now and into eternity. Oh I love you, I know what you want. And I believe in what you're doing. I'm just not sure of myself. oh I hope you find a way! Why don't you come and hear me preach on Sunday? I'll never say no to that. *sighs* is it against the rules for an orderly to kiss a nurse in the hospital room? Why reverend Jones! How dare you!? *Smooch* That no? Don't matter what it is Charlie, you wouldn't know what to do with her. Uh-oh here comes a preacher, quick! Turn that picture around charlie! He's alright... works like a darn fool which is more than you can say now don't you make any remarks to get him riled up. Or he'll stand up, and give us a 45 minute sermon. Hiya Jim! Hey Tommy! How's it going? OK! Sit down. *Clears Throat* Haven't uh, seen you around for a while uh what'cha been up you? Uhh... Nothin' much studying for graduation Doin' a little preachin' what'd you want boy? I do my own sweepin'. I want to get a haircut. I don't cut steel wool with my shears. huh? You get your butt and your bird head (Nest) outa' here and tell your mammy to cut your hair with the hedge clippers... I just want to get a haircut for my mama's burial. Well ya ain't gonna get it here! *Closes Book* Just wait a minute!? Just what do you think you're doing? D'you hear what he said? He wants a haircut for his mama's funeral! I don't care if he wants it for his own funeral, I ain't gonna cut no niggers hair here! What difference does it make he's a little boy, haven't you got any feelings? we're all the same in the eyes of God! This ain't God's barber shop. N' it ain't gonna be mine either if I use my tools on that nigger's head! And it's not mine either! now or ever! For this is the house of the devil and those that abide here are cursed! C'mon son, let's get outta here! *Intercom Chatter* *sighs* Well that's the best we can do. Thank you ma'am. Oh you're welcome! Thanks Marcy. You really look handsome. Your Mama's gonna be so proud of you lookin' down from heaven. I have to get back to work. I'll walk George back downstairs. Thank you sir. You're welcome! You know something Mr. Jones? I'd be proud to be your wife. *Smooch* How about that George!? Huh!? *Wedding Bells!* To the Jones'! Ah! *Smooch* Oh!!! I'm so happy! I'll be really a good wife for Jim. Where are you going on your honeymoon? oh well we're going to Indianapolis so he can study for his ordination and then he can apply for pulpit... Well now that figures some men take their wife on a honeymoon my son takes his wife to church. Oh but our whole life will be a honeymoon! ...I don't think so I've been there a couple times. I'm so proud of you son oh I do envy your mother having a son like you! Oh! You're my mother too, my religious mother and I'll never be able to thank you enough. *Smooch* We want to make you feel as welcome as we can Mr. Jones. Thank you. it's important to understand that one of the main reasons for us to accept your application for this ministry is that well we've been losing membership over the last several years... Why what's wrong? well the neighborhood's been changing and this is an older area as you know and since the war people seem to have tired of it some of our families have moved to the outskirts of town... More than some it's not like it used to be when a man bought a house and settled in for a lifetime to raise a family. Don't the new families need the church as much as the others? It doesn't seem to have worked out that way. You see what we were hoping Mr. Jones, is that perhaps a younger man with more zeal and energy could kind of stir up the spirit of this church! I'll certainly do my best! *Winks* *Hymn* "Now we'll find our soul is there. (Dead)" *Hand Gesture* *Clears Throat* I have a few announcements to make all of them pretty gloomy, the sewing circle is canceling its meetings until further notice, due to a lack of attendance. The Women's Guild has withdrawn invitations to our annual potluck supper on behalf of our missionary fund. There didn't seem to be anybody who wanted to attend. Since only two children regularly attend Sunday school, class has been canceled... *Crosses Arms* *Stern Look* No! Now just a minute, I am going to cancel that cancelation! If there's one that I believe this church must maintain. It is it's obligation to our young people whether we're talking about one child or a thousand children! The Sunday school class will continue! I'll conduct it myself, with the assistance of mrs. Jones ;) *Nods* *Thinking* *Guyanese Hell On Earth. Paradise* Marcy... are you worried about something? Something on your mind? *Sighs* Jenny I'm worried about Jim, I'm worried about what will happen if anyone leaves Jim is just gonna feel so betrayed, I just, I don't know what he'll do! What if a few of em leave? The rest of us are going to be here. We ain't going anywhere! Ain't nobody and nothing can make me leave Jim Jones. You know that. Ain't nobody know him, like we know him. We've been with him so long that we can't even think of any other life, you know that. *Scoff, Gasp, Nods* I remember the first day he came to my door. *Laughs* Hi honey! Hello! I'm Jim Jones, pastor of the Summerset south side church! I'd like to invite you to services on Sunday! *Laughs* I know you have... good intentions, but I hardly think I'm what you want for you church! oh you're exactly what I want for my church miss...? Jenny. oh Jenny... Jenny. Jenny? D'you know the story of Mary Magdalene? If she works in this neighborhood I know her. *Chuckles* Listen, would you mind if I came in for a few minutes just to talk! TALK? Yes ma'am talk. Well I ain't never turned no man away before, you can come in. Thank you! Good morning Jenny! It was good to see you in church yesterday, now isn't this just a little early for you? Well I didn't sleep all night and I wasn't working either! "OH!?" Run out here and I'm gonna get me a dress! Proper church-going dress, like those other ladies wear, I ain't gonna bring no shame on you Mr. Jones. There's no shame from me, in anything you do Jenny. Or ever have done, you can come to the Lord in rags or in silk. (I'm God) just as long as you come to him, that's all that matters... I hope so, for the first time since I was a little girl I hope so. I really really hope so. *Sighs* But, do you think it's alright for colored people to come into your church? I mean there's people that looked at us like we was pigs in a parlor. Of course it's all right. We're all God's children Jenny, each of us the same in his eyes. Yeah well God ain't the only one that's lookin'. *Chuckles* *Laughs* I'll cya Ted. What do you say Preacher? How are ya Mr. Richard? Say uh... Where's that big monkey you had in the window? Well nobody wanted him, so I put him to work cleaning out the basement. *Chuckles* We missed you yesterday. Yeah well one of these days... I was busy feeding the animals how did you get into the pet shop business? Your love of animals? Uhh-ahh, I hate anything with more than two legs. I had a misfortune of inheriting this place about six months ago I was an accountant. You know I worked on other people's tax problems. Then my uncle dies and leaves me this. Can't you sell em? I can't sell one animal, let alone an entire pet shop! You know what's in the basement? Uncle Harold's last practical joke... More monkies! *Chuckles* Then when the last of the payroll goes into bananas, I'll have to fire my staff of one. And then what? Why don't you come over to the church and pray with me for an answer? *Sighs* Pray ugh... What have you got to lose!? You're not doing very well without it! You know preacher, there's uh, a lot of talk about you taking blacks into that church. Does that bother you? nothing bothers me except keeping company with monkeys. (Black joke) but it bothers a lot of other people what the hell I mean, I mean heck. This was the national headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan. The only God I know is for white and black for any other color that comes to him with faith! Yeah, well, it's your funeral... And I may just come over there and watch it, cause uh... You don't have the price of a movie. Ha! I wish you'd do that!!! come on, come on! Shut up! Quit your whining! *Clang* *Hymn* welcome brothers and sisters welcome to the rebirth of the Holy Spirit in this venerable place of worship! For this is the home of the Lord, and you are all welcome here! Today I will take my sermon from that pure and beautiful ideal of love the brotherhood of man! The scripture saith there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek, for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Amen. Amen. some of us think you're not revitalizing this church at all you're destroying it, now one... *Dead Dog Smashes Thru Window* "Nigger lover!" What the hell!? It's a dog! My God, they've cut it's throat! Dear God, poor animal, why would they do this to you? *Sobs* *Is our preacher that soft!? I'm in the Klan!* Jim, we called you in to discuss a matter of church policy, but it's gone beyond that. I'm sorry Jim we're going to put out a call for a new minister. *Damn right!* *Softly* WHAT?! Didn't you see that church last Sunday? Every pew filled! yes filled! with... "WITH WHAT!?" You're young, you're inexperienced, you'd be better off spending a few years in a smaller more tranquil community. I mean that, sincerely. *Sniffs* Sincerely!? I don't think there's a sincere man on the board of this church! There's no love here. This is the last church I'll ever enter where I put my beliefs in the hands of small men without vision! Without faith!! *Dodges Kids* Brothers and sisters!? Brothers and sisters, will you pray with me!? Oh Lord I beseech thee in all thy majestic wisdom and mercy to see the burden that these, your children must carry. "Amen." We are all together in this world. Black and white, red, brown and yellow. A single humanity suffering the pains of this mortal life, working for the joys of thy eternal peace... Lift our hearts, lift our souls, take us unto thine almighty presence and keep us safe from harm. Amen. Amen! Amen. "Praise the Lord!" Amen. Where is your church brother? My church is here, my church is everywhere! Well, wherever it is, I-I want to go to it! You're always welcome. You're are ALL welcome!!! *Dun, Dun-Dun, Dun, Dun-Dun, Dun!* Oh! Isn't that nice? Wait a minute, hold on. I wanna look at this! Otis! That is a wonderful job! Wonderful! come on let's get inside before we freeze to death… *Whooping* *Ooh Woo!* Mr. Jones? Yes? Karen Bundy, umm from Mr. Richard's pet shop. Hi Karen, welcome to the peoples temple. Clayton told me how sorry he was he had to let you go he said you were very bright very conscientious I told him you sounded just like the person we needed to run our childcare program! Thank God, I was scared that you wouldn't want me here. *Chuckles* In this place of God. Come on in! Come on, you'll see everything's all right. C'mon! My heart's full of joy I want to share it with you! Sunday, this place will be as shiny as a new dime and as pure and sweet as the mercy of our Lord! Come on... do you know anything about the temple our work here? Only a little, only what Mr. Richie told me. Whatever it is I hope, umm, it keeps on going. Every job I've had in the last 18 months has gone out of business. Like Mr. Ritchie's pet shop. *Chuckles* Well we're not gonna go out of business! We're here for a long long time we're in the business of eternity! *Tsk* Look um... anyone who knows life and the pain involved, would also know that you've suffered. I can see it in your eyes. It's just that I've tried so hard for so long. And... *single tear* We're here to welcome you to the true faith and the true belief. Are you ready to come to God? (Me) *Nods* I think so... There, there, dear child. Now all of it's alright. My father threw me out of the house, he caught me with a guy, and we weren't even doing anything. Our hearts are open to you Karen, you have no more worries I'll take care of you. (I Think I am GOD) *Soft grunt* *Nods* You're the kindest man in the world. I don't know how to thank you! I'm really happy! I feel happy!! *Big Wet Smooch* (Jones Turned On) *Glances to make sure no one saw his infedelity* *Tsk* Let me, let me show you the rest of the temple. Mmm ok. Uh-huh. Uh-huh! Yea, what do ya want? So you've joined the madhouse huh? Door was open! Yeah, there's nothing in the register but bills for the food these monsters eat! Clayton, I've got a proposition for you. Hello! Mrs. Kruger? Yes? I'm Jim Jones pastor of the people's temple, I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes. Oh well our family goes to uh, great Presbyterian. Yes ma'am! That's a fine church. What I want to talk to you about is, a delightful gift of love and friendship for your children! Think how surprised and delighted they'd be, to come home this afternoon and find this sweet little fellow waiting to greet them? Oh! I don't think they'd want one of those, uh, what kind is it? It's a capuchin monkey ma'am. One of the cleanest most docile house pets you could possibly have! it's far more intelligent than a dog, much more loving than a cat. Easy to train, lives on a few pieces of fruit, and as clean as a pin. Look at that! He loves you! He'd be loving your entire family! It'd just break his heart to be taken from you. Oh I don't know. It's for a good Christian cause ma'am, and the $29 purchase price includes a month supply of bananas! :) *Subtlety Evil Grin* 1, 2, 3, 74! One Hundred and Seventy-Four Dollars! Here ya are Clayton! The first income of the peoples temple, our wings of deliverance! you'd better open up a bank account! you're great salesman Jim, but you don't know business. I better open you a non-profit corporation before you have to hand this over to the tax collector. I don't understand... Oh, don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. just tell me what you want to call it. Call it, wings of deliverance! Incorporated! (INC.) Ha! Mr. Stephens be reasonable, tell the wholesalers to be reasonable! Mr. Stephens, how are you? Fine, well maybe not so good. You see my business' C.O.D. to me that's cash on delivery to him credit on delivery! Well why don't we just go inside and talk to Jim about it? It's really gonna warm your heart when you see where all this food is going! Oh, those presents that Jim has, for Mr. Stephens' children, will you get those for me Clayton? (Lies) *Soft Moan* Ugh... Jim takes care of the spiritual needs of the Flock. And I take care of the more material needs. (BS) Here's our health clinic. This ping-pong table was donated (Stolen) This is Myron and this is Charlie. Mr. Stephens. "Hi." And over here we have all these books. And they've been donated to us, also. XD N' This is my favorite section, we set up a daycare center for the uh, children of the working mothers. "This money is owed to you. Every time that you received a pension" ... now these elderly people, they don't realize the Social Security benefits they're entitled to so this is Jean, now she's gonna assist them and help them deal with the government agencies. one day soon we're going to open up our homes for these elderly people. Here is the produce that you've delivered today. Now some of this goes to feeding the volunteer workers. but more than two-thirds if it goes to feeding needy families. Cut it out Nora? Are you crazy!? Or am I crazy? Or are we both going nuts!? Now monkies and promises of salvation just aren't going to make it. WE'RE BROKE! We're goin' into debt faster than I can add it up! Now, Clayton, Clayton. I am just beginning! Jim we... Now, now now now now. What I want you to think about is forming another corporation this one will also be non-profit, they'll deal in..Uhh Real estate. Buying, selling, transferring the donated proceeds to the temple and whole title to the building here, which we're going to purchase! Jim we don't know a thing about real estate. Call it Jim Le-Mar after me my mother and Marceline will be the board of directors, and you'll be the treasurer. Yeah yeah yeah, but you don't have anything to use as a base.That's a deed to a house and two acres of land formerly owned by granny Carver. How did you get that? It was a gift to the temple. A gift of gratitude... what am I supposed to do with this!? *Evil Eye* Sell it and pay the Grocery bills! *Kitchen Chatter* Have a piece of bread, that's what you need isn't it? *Orange trick* oh! *Chuckles* *Vandalism* *Grimace* (Who goes into a church that has been trashed?!) Dear God almighty, I am a nigger lover! I say it with, humility not pride. I say it with sorrow not hate, but we know here today that those who have attempted to defile us, to hurt us, to condemn us! Have truly helped us!! Yes helped us! For now we know how desperately the work of this church is needed. "Amen!" Now we can see, how clearly the lines have been drawn between the forces of good and the legions of evil! (Amens) Now we know, that the enemy is not just some mysterious force, lurking in the dark shadows, but a real and vicious enemy!!! REMEMBER THIS! Never forget this... it will become worse! (Klan cheering, yelling) *Cross Set Ablaze!* C'mon out here! Before we come in and get ya! Don't go out there! If they come in the house, take the baby out the back. Go out into the woods. Sweet Jesus! They're not gonna do anything. They just want to scare me... So, you know what to do. C'mon out here before we come in and get ya! *Shotgun shots* Nigga!? "You comin' out!?" "Get that nigga!" "C'mon out boy!" what do you want with me? I never did anything to you. Just get out of here, unless you want that house and everything in it burned to the ground!? NO! no no!!!! *Otis is brave!* I'd like to see them burn their crosses before a man of God! I'd like to see the flesh ripped from their bodies with a terrible swift sword, of an angry Jehovah! Beasts like that should suffer the agonies of the Damned! Jim please, you could frighten the baby. I'm sorry, my feelings just got the best of me. (I'm not God) Miss Jefferson would be glad to stay with the baby. You should go down to the hospital. God bless you both. (Jim wonders if he is God) Ok now, we've got it all laid out here to give you an idea of cost against cash flow. I don't care about numbers, my people are being helped. They're being helped to raise two thousand dollars a month more than were collecting... That's impossible!? well the numbers are here they don't lie. Clayton... This church is doing more than the city of Indianapolis! We've got nursing homes for the elderly? Food programs... Job placement programs, clothing exchanges, nursery school. Now something has got to go! No! We don't retreat, we expand! You can't expand on credit! The temples gonna end up in bankruptcy court, and they'll close us down! I can't believe this!? We have at least eight pieces of property donated by my followers... But only one of those pieces is in a white middle-class neighborhood, the Dobson family place. People are moving into the suburbs, small homes and deteriorating areas just don't move that quickly... Then cut the prices! Give second mortgages, see what you can do about getting these suppliers to cut their prices... No way! No? What if all the people in this congregation said they were going to stop using what these people supply? And what if 500 letters were written each and every day. To names selected from the telephone book, urging that these suppliers be avoided? *Evil Schemes* I'll do what you want, I'm going to bed! Goodnight Clayton. *Grins* You know who you should see? *Back rub* Father divine... (Darth Vader) he doesn't have any financial trouble... Became famous? I know nothing of such worldly things brother Joe, we're all lambs in our father's flock. How do you support the Shepherd? Do you tithe? Do you contribute part of your income? I-I just don't understand... There's nothing to contribute all of us divested ourselves of all worldly possessions, as we entered heaven, and the grace of father divine. ALL OF IT!? The gift is here, the gift of eternal salvation! His touch can heal the lame and the halt the broken and the blind... I want to thank you for the tour. This is a very beautiful place, tell me do you visit your family at home? But this is heaven! There's no other place for me. (Delusional!) Father will see you now Mr. Jones. "Thank You." (She's chunky for a giver?) (I am your Father) I've wanted to meet you for a long time. Most of mankind has shared your hope. (Luke) I'm very impressed with such a beautiful place. *Nods* It's Heaven! Father, you were forced to leave New York, was it because you were too weak to conquer the Philistines? No my son it was because, we were becoming too strong, and they were frightened. but how could you sustain such a movement? And how did my son Moses sustain his flock? But the cost!? Ask and you shall receive my son. ask and you shall receive. All worldly possessions? Sustenance of whatever kind the Holy Father requires. *Thinking* Father, umm... sometimes, the women in my flock tempt me. (I'm horny) What shall I do about that? It is your duty, your religious obligation to umm... Bring their desires to the surface, so that you can eliminate them. Remember Mary wasn't a virgin. (Magdaline or Mother Mary?) I think you've given a whole new world to me, Father divine. As it should be! So let it be my son. *Feeds God Complex* Tell me..... Do you really believe that you're God? I don't have to say that I am God and I don't have to say that I am NOT God. I say there's thousands of people, who call me God millions of them! And millions of people who call me the devil, but I don't say that I am God and I don't say that I'm the devil. but I produce God and shake the Earth with it! *Evil Grin* Thank you Father! Thank you. *Hymn* The gifts of heaven, what are they? What has God given you today? The food in your bellies, the clothes on your back, these flowers you see! He has given you life! But what have you given to God? Have you helped to pay his bills? Have you helped to provide him shelter at his place of worship? have you given until all your energy is drained as his mercy must be drained!? have you given until your back aches with the effort? as his must ache...Carrying the burdens of a sinful world... Oh children, children. We must all give, give give!!!!! *Deep Contemplation* *Hymn* (Needles suck) *Hymn* (Stealing Pensions) *Hymn* (Ping-Pong Skills) *Hymn* Jim? you all right? *sigh* Yeah, I'm alright, alright. Here I brought you some tea. *Scoffs* It's just this burden is incredible! There's not enough time in the day to do it all. well you're exhausted. You're working too much. Not nearly enough. Delegate some of the responsibility and the authority to the committee? Does God delegate responsibility and authority!? (I think I'm God Again) Marcy I'm tired and I need something... *Bites Lip* Pills? Yeah, what they called? Amphetamines..... BLESS THESE HANDS!! Give me the power of your sweet charity oh Jesus!! Come to me children. Come to me. Give me your lame you're blind in your halt and I will heal them! For I am filled with the faith in the power and glory of the Lord, and you shall receive the Magnificent gifts he is prepared to bestow upon the faithful! (Whispers information) O Lord, I pray for this, your devoted servant. We all pray together, for we belieeeeve in the spirit and the mercy of God Almighty! Oh devil deaf spirit, devil deaf spirit come out! *Slaps Hands* "Lord, I can hear..." Did you hear? It's a miracle! Hallelujah! do you have faith? Yes, I do. do you truly believe? Indeed I do! are you ready for the sickness that twists your body to come out? I'd give everything to God! (Not you, Jim) Then be healed!!! Walk sister! Walk for us! *Gasps* I can walk! *Cheering* Praise God! Hallelujah! It's a miracle! She can walk! Praise God, Praise God almighty! (It was a deceptive scheme) Was I alright? Of course! You were perfect... I feel funny about pretending this way. Fooling them. We're not fooling anyone Karen we're reinforcing their faith, showing that it can work miracles. (Liar) Just trust me, Karen. I know the power of faith. I also know that it can be helped with just a little push... (untz, untz untz) *Delusional* You're truly a wonderful, brilliant man! I'm not just a man Karen. I've been blessed. (With Amphetamines) And chosen! *Mmm Smoochy* (Caught being an adulterer) Marcy!!!! (White ties are still cool!) I know you're awake Marcy. I want to talk to you. Nothin' to talk about. Oh yes, there is. You're the one person who truly understands the burden I'm carrying is the embodiment of faith... You can't take that understanding away from me! Just as I'm about to see my way through this miasma of mortal confusion. To the path of salvation and righteousness! (Amphetamine Psychosis) Don't you preach to me, not when I found you in the arms of another woman! It wasn't even a woman, it was a child! I have to be all things to all men and women! (Sleeping with men soon) You should see a doctor, a psychiatrist. A PSYCHIATRIST!? I've had a vision of life everlasting don't you understand!? I'm having miraculous insights unlike any I've ever heard before!! (Needs Sleep) Marceline, I am the chosen one (Psychosis) you have to understand and support me...you have to keep faith with me! What about our marriage?! What about faith in that? We are one flesh, now and forever... Your faith!? *Cough* Is it in this little black book of myths and fables and a thousand and one mistakes? "Yes" (Deception) *Gasps* No! you cannot put all your faith in that little black book! Is your faith in some vision, some fantasy of God as a golden-haired figure in a rainbow? "No!" An imaginary sunburst in the clouds? "NO!" Then where is your faith? Is it where it belongs? In the message I bring to you!? In me!? The spiritual father of your church? (Jim feels like God again...) "Yes!" What? I can't hear your faith..."yes!" Praise God! Praise God! My children, my children, my children. You are all MY CHILDREN... And I am your spiritual father. Who will guide you, who will love you and save you. Save you from temptation, save you from sin and then take you to the gates of paradise. That eternal heaven that awaits each of us who truly believes! (Amen) and I will bring you, the fruits of this life. For your faith in me gives you power. (God Complex) Power greater than any on this earth! And we must be certain of your faith. There must not be the slightest shadow of doubt, you must show it, demonstrate it! Brothers and sisters, stand up when I call your name. (Otis thinks he's one) Brother Curtis, Sister Fleming, sister moss. Sister Calhoun! brother Emery, sister Hagen brother Marez brother Phillips... I appoint you and I charge you with the responsibility of maintaining a constant vigil over these sinful, fallible mortals. When they falter we must give them strength. when they transgress we must punish them. when they fail. We must make them succeed! And we will succeed!! In the name of heaven we will succeed! To exemplify, purify and glorify in God Almighty!!! Praise God! What have you been saying about father Jones Mrs. Crandall!? I don't know what you mean... Don't make it worse by denying it sister! D'you think you can keep being secret!? word gets out! you know what we mean you've been disrespectful. Ya let your grasp on your faith weaken. you let it slip away! I've done all I could! But not until you had to be reminded! Not until someone had to come looking for you! Nobody had to come lookin' for me. oh no? Your measly little pledge had to be forced from your pocket! While you were collecting blood money (Rent) from a poor tenant. That property is all I've got! That's all you've got! And what's the temple got? What's our dear father Jones got to take care of!? All his suffering children! I don't know! Has he got you to help? Has he got your faith to support him? You are a Philistine and a godless one among us! Nooo! No! This doesn't involve faith. It involves money! That too, that more than anything. Cus' that is the way we can achieve our goals and withstand even the hatred of our enemies. And I must have loyalty even from you, especially from you! "Oh, I see..." I'm sorry, *Stammers* No no no! Come in, we're just finishing. Hello. Trouble? No, just a disagreement over my need for loyalty... You don't need any problems now. All our hard work has just paid off, the mayor's appointed you head of the Human Rights Commission, we've got some political clout now! I guess they know I can get things done. They know you can deliver votes and now you can deliver jobs. You take the loyal church members, N' you put into civil service jobs. You can control the city... I didn't know I had Machiavelli, working in the accounting office. (Is that supposed to be a compliment?) *Adultery ensues* you are very special to me *Clears Throat* He's a very lucky man. So are you! *Smooch Doom* How many? 350. Huh? Three Hundred and Fifty tickets. I don't know.... I never sold... I'd better call the manager. Mr. Brooks somebody out here wants 350 tickets......listen I don't have to take talk like that to hold this dumb job, come out here & tell em' yourself! What's the problem? No problem, I want 350 tickets for the next show and here's the money! For $350 I'll get up and do a tap dance between the cartoon and the feature! (Gay) Wait a minute, wait a minute! What the hell is this!? Section for coloureds only holds 50 people! Sir, this is a historic moment! We're desegregating the first theater in Indianapolis. You can't do this to me! I'll call the authorities. I am the authority. *God Complex* I'm Jim Jones, the cities new human rights commissioner. :D Just as long as we're here I'd like to talk to you about job opportunities in your theater for some of the young men in our church! :) The largest nuclear devices tested to date, carrying a destructive force a thousand times greater than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima! *Hallucinating from lack of sleep* I've had a vision. It came to me in the night, and it came to me from God! A nuclear holocaust more devastating than any catastrophe known to man since the great flood! That only Noah escaped! Worse than that. I have seen it I have heard the screams of the helpless. I have watched whole cities turned to cinders! I know that it is a true vision and that we are due. (Doomed?) And where will you hide? From this vengeance that has been promised, again and again! To sinful man to careless man - faceless man? Prepare! prepare yourself! Are you ready to meet your maker!? Scientists, uhh military experts. They know of only nine places on the face of the earth that would be safe. Ukiah California in the Redwood Valley is one of them and that's where we're going! Those of you who have donated all your worldly possessions to the church, will travel with us to this sanctuary, and there you'll help us to build a glorious new people's temple!! ~ Just a fool, cause I can see Jesus. Oh yeah! The man who made me free. oh yeah! He was a man who bled and suffered. You know he died for you and for me. ~ *Choir Harmony?* (Here come the dead-beats) I just don't understand... I need a church but I can't build it. you need workers but you won't hire them. Now what in God's name is wrong here!? Mr. Jones this is a rural area, you can't take skilled craftsman off the trees, it takes time. There are hundreds of men just sitting around in the little towns around here. But they're not builders, they're sitters, that's the problem! You come outside with me, I want to show you something! Sir sir! are you the foreman? Not now kid. Wait a minute... What do you want son? I'm looking for work. See there are men who want to be hired! What'd do you do? Are'ye carpenter, plumber, driver? "I've done a lil' of all of those." Do you hold a card? No but I'll work hard!! look I'm strong enough for anything you got here! (Panting) You don't look strong enough to get to a doctor's office! You been sick? I had a virus, I'm okay now. "Hire Him!" Mr. Jones he's not qualified he doesn't have a union card and I think he's... (a junkie) He looks all right to me. *Foreshadowing* aren't you son? Well... *Collapses* David, david , david! He's ok he's alright, David! David! david! Thank God, he wasn't up on scaffold! I'll take care of him! You get some men on this job! He's as cold as ice! "He's okay he's okay." Tracks, this man is a junkie. Better get him to a hospital. NO, they'll lock him up! (makes sense for once) what's he been taking!? Nothing! Nuthin'. Don't lie to me! He's in serious trouble and I want to help him, just as I want to help all children of God! He *Sniff* just came here to get a job, we don't have any money! For God's sake tell me, I'm a minister, I'm not a policeman! "Paregoric" (Opium tincture) uh.. Methadone. Heroin! heroin addict. Heroin? what's gonna happen to him? Please just take him! Be quiet! I'm going to take care of him, he's not going anywhere in July freedom from this demon that's possessing his soul. Jim, he's known as a "drug addict." We got to think about when he wakes up he's gonna be awfully sick, he's gonna be acting crazy. Faith can cure anything! Otis, call Marcy, tell her to get us some tranquilizers some stimulants, whatever we're gonna need to take care of him. (Drugs for a drug addict) Tell her to take this girl out and get her fed, I don't want her around him until this is over! (He's my child, I'm God) Karen, I want this girl fed. I don't think you give the instructions in this area! umm, these are father Jones' instructions. That's all you have to say? Feed her? *Stirring the adultery pot* It's alright we don't (inaudible) *Gasps!* Take his coat off! *Groans* Easy! Don't hurt him. He's alright... *Soft Chatter* "Oh, please!" okay, it's okay! "Here we go!" Start a fire, Harry. *Panting* Easy... "Oh no!" Don't fight me, don't fight me. Don't fight me, I'm going to fight this battle with you. "Oh Please!" I'm going to fight this battle with ya! We're in this together. (Bed) so please dear God give us strength and courage. To face these agonies that approach us. Dear God give us strength to save his poor soul, from the demons that are torturing. Bring him peace, bring him peace. *Strokes* *Grunts, Groans and Screams* Get back up here! I've got you, I've got you. *Moans* Let the Lord in, c'mon, hold on! *Wheezing Cry* (Wait, why are Jim's clothes off!?) (Lookin' Sweaty) *Sleeps* *Yawns* "Good morning" *Sighs* You watch out for him okay? Call if there's any change. *Sips* How's the boy? He's sleeping... I have uh, Sheila working in the Kitchen and she's staying at Jenny's. That boy in there he could be my son. (God Complex) I have to talk to you Jim. Not now I want you to help me, honey I need a shot (amphetamines) "No! Now!" I am tired of being humiliated by your lovers (Karen) I will not put up with it anymore! God Marcillion, don't I have enough on my mind!? I have put up with so many of them (Boys too) now Karen is treating me like I'm a piece of dirt and I am NOT gonna stand for it anymore! "Come on!" I want a divorce! *Rage Twitch* You try to divorce me and neither one of us will live to see it happen. Do you understand!? do you understand!?? don't you ever mention that to me again!!! Now come on and help me! (Shoot up) *Contemplation* *Evil Eye* *Drug Lust* *Needle prick* *Drug-Gasm* *A Vision From God!* I believe that I'd joined the People's Temple because it was the... the one place where I felt wanted and accepted... And where people of all races were working together to carry out the teachings of the gospel. "You think Jim Jones is sincere then?" In the beginning, yes. I believe he was sincere. *Sighs* "Mr. Richie you're in position to answer a question which keeps coming up, and that is, is the People's Temple a bona-fide religion? Or is it a crazy cult?" Well you can do a lot of arguing about definitions congressman but uhh... I think it basically comes down to one thing. The People's Temple is Jim Jones. It always has been, it started out to be one thing but, as he changed, it changed. you were with the temple a long time weren't you? Yeah from the beginning... that's where I met my wife. *Sighs* Jim spends money faster than I can add these bills! Clayton will you help me with this please? Huh? Will you help me? "Oh yeah sure. I will, just a second." I'll be glad when our new office and the church is finished and we're out of here! *Phew* I think the movers dropped it! *Clicks Tongue* Had A key? "I had a key." *Laughs* I don't see much of you... Well it's been a busy time. You have time for Jim... "He needs all the support he can get Clayton, you know that." So do I... Gene, if we were together. If we made a life together, we could find time. Are you proposing to me Clayton? Yeah... You know what I am... What I can do. I'll give you a good life! And what about Jim!? Well I know how you feel about him. I know how, women feel about him. All the women in this church, are in love with him, in one way or another... If I couldn't accept that I wouldn't be able to ask you... If you couldn't accept that I wouldn't be able to say yes Clayton! *Smooch* I think we also have a medicare cheque for you to sign Mrs. Mathers. Yes, right here. Just sign that for me please. (Stealing from old people) *Heartless* … *Guilty* All gifts to the Almighty! God Bless You Mrs. Mathers. God bless you father. How've you been feeling? "Fine, good." We'll you see you a little later. That's the last cheque for today. Thirty-nine thousand for the month (Inaudible) I'll take these to the bank this afternoon and you and I can stop at City all right? Grrreat! What's going on? Gene and I are gonna go down and get the license, we're getting married. *Lust Glance* What!? That's wonderful! it's about time, congratulations Clayton you're a very lucky man! Well thank you Jim. *Kiss* See ya later. (What? I will shag ye still.) I'm very happy for you. I'm three months pregnant Jim. (With your Child) Well David's family wanted him to go to medical school and me just to go. A-way! *Chuckles* well he's got a fine mind he should be a Dr. Oh I don't know he doesn't seem quite strong enough without his family to function. So we'll probably end up back in Haight-Ashbury. (Hippie-ville) And back on drugs? Never! We can't let that happen! (I use drugs everyday) We've worked too hard! I don't know, so primitive and natural here there's no time, there is no time and there's no trouble here! Wish we could stay. It's like the Garden of Eden where it all began (I'm God) mm-hmm... I like to come here to commune with the creator of all this. Without the constant demands on my time. in this place, this heaven that you've almost single-handedly created I think is one of the most beautiful things that I've ever seen. (Except he used people) the giving of so much love. We must all give our love! (I'm Horny from Amphetamines) and everything we have. And you could help me. help me to make a better life for David. Anything ;) ... I'm asking you to be close to God (Me) close to me. (I think I'm God) *Stammers* David says... "Don't you see that by giving to me, you're really helping him? He needs me now! And I need you..." *Smooch Doom* You're much too sensitive for this world. our toil matters are everywhere but I'll protect you David. (Toilet manners) Hi honey, how you doin'? Ya look like a girl with troubles! No I'm fine. (Lies) *Homosexuality* *Jealousy* you know umm. There are some men in this world who uh. Can't live by the rules that apply to most of us. They need so much! They need everything they need everybody. But... wouldn't it be called sinful here in this church? *Shakes head* For some maybe but not for those who, who give everything they've got to the world around them. The way I see it, they're Saints and anything they do is alright as long as they just keep right on being right. (Wrong-o! 1st Corinthians 6:9-10) I just can't stand it anymore he has taken over our lives our bodies and our mind. Ya don't understand he saved my life, he's a - he's a true messenger of God! Maybe he is God! How can you believe that? (Brainwashing) don't you see what he's doing to those poor people? "Look at me!" remember what it was like before we found him look-it look look at my arms no more sores. Look @ my eyes! No more pain! I'm surrounded by drugs! I turn to the dispenser, it never even crosses my mind that I want them. Or that I once might've been a junkie! This is just as bad! how can a man of God have used the bodies of a man and a woman together and alone? A married preacher, it's obscene and it's insane! He has special needs... ;) He - he, gives so much of himself. His spirit and his flesh and his love. Has to be returned from whatever source he finds. I've given everything I have for you too David, do you hear me? Everything... and I've gone to bed with everything from traveling salesman to this religious maniac to get you a fix or help when you needed it, and you owe me too! I'm leaving! would you come with me? Please David? Please? *Walking in the dark with sunglasses* *Checks address* *666 Knocks* Just a minute! *Sneeze* *Forces way in* Hello Dave (Baby) *Removes Sunglasses* it wasn't easy to find you maybe he didn't want to be found! I know you're not trying to hide from me You're trying to hide from yourself. God looks after you always David. Please leave him alone... Leave us alone. Do you want him back on heroin? Do you want to turn him into a zombie again? Do you want him helpless and totally dependent so you can suck the life from him? I saved him, and I will not lose him, to you to drugs or anything else! (I luv him) David, you're coming back to me, aren't ya? "No, please." Yes, you are! You're gonna go back to school, and you're gonna train that mind of yours and you're going to be a doctor! You're going to save the Holy Spirit that I found in you... Cause you love God David. (Me) because you love me! You must prove that one day... *Foreshadowing* let's prove it now, and forever D'you understand? of course you understand! Stop! I want you here! I WANT you to see this... *Leans in for a smooch* *Heart Breaking* *Sobs* "Dave..." *Sobs* *Deep Gasp* *Cries* *Cheering* *Clapping* Woo! Yeah! "Yeah!" Oh my my my! Here we are Lord! We have arrived! Paradise... Paradise Lost, Paradise found! (White ties are still cool) We are reborn in the name of the spirit and I consecrate this holy place to the Almighty! AMEN! But it was not God who brought you here. "No?" No, no no… It was Jim Jones that made this happen! *Cheers* And... It is Jim Jones who will show you, the path to peace and prosperity through work and devotion. (To me, God) Yes I will! "Praise the Lord!" And what has your Minister. Your father, led you from? He's led you from this! *Gasps* *Boos* Don't look away! Don't turn your eyes from this revolting scene. This is what they did to you, and this is what they'll do to you again, if you don't follow ME! "We'll follow you!" Is this what you want? "No!" What?! What!? "No!" Or is this, what you want? Huh!? "shame on you" Never again. "Never again." Never again! "Never again!" Do you remember? "yes." Do you remember? I will save you from all of this! I can't hear you!? Or you want to face the realization of my vision of Armageddon?! (During a psychotic episode) "No!, Yes!" "Yes!" "No! no!" These are the questions you must answer. When you look into your hearts and souls and if you are found wanting. You know the terrible consequences... For without me, In life and in death, you are doomed to eternal agony! *Amazing Grace* "I see! I see! I see!" End of first half... I see! Thank you, I see! Yes I do, Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Praise God, I love ya all! Intermission Part Two! the film you are about to see is a dramatization of the life of Jim Jones born May 13th 1931 in Lynn Indiana died November 18th 1978 in Jonestown Guyana this is his story *Checks watch, timing Jim's drug doses* *Looks over shoulder* Hello Jim! *Parrot caw* "Hello." It looks really beautiful out there! congressman Ryan should be impressed. *Tsk!* you've always been such an idealist, but they're not coming here to seek the truth! They're coming here to destroy it! This will give you a better outlook. *Injects Drug Cocktail* Don't go yet David! Stay with me while the enemy is here! *Coo-Coo* They'll be such an ordeal, I may need more, m-medication. "Jim you know I'll be close by." yes of course, I can always rely on you David. My we've come a long way... Do you remember those days in Ukiah? Somethings got a hold on me! *Hymn-tage* I couldn't be happier. It's my baby. I'm not sure. (Harlot) I am, I know that's my child! But Clayton doesn't... Clayton will be very proud that I am the father. Jim please, don't tell him that! Not now! *Hymn-tage* C'mon, *Grunts* Here we go. Perry Perry always taking care of me! always protecting me... *Grunts, pants* Lay with me a while, I need your strength. *Hymn-tage* Do you know the drill? Tell me one more time... All right. Stick this under the seat in front of you and you keep your feet on it until you get to Paris. Then at Orly field, you book the next flight out to Geneva. You take a cab to "?Lando-Feraire?" and you make the deposit. Okay, when do I sleep? After the money's in the bank. Jim don't you think somebody ought to go with her? No, the last thing anyone would expect a girl like this to have would be a suitcase full of money. S'cuse me gentlemen, we're coming up on the San Francisco turn off in about five minutes. Thanks Perry. D'you get my medicine ready? "Yeah." *Sigh* For God's sakes Jim get some sleep, you've been going for 48 hours! No I can't sleep! I've got too much to do! Well you're gonna burn yourself out! You ought to try to relax a little you know? Stop taking those pills that keep you jumping all the time and that..... "Clayton..." I want you to find a church in San Francisco right away, buy it! Then Los Angeles. *Needle Prick* *Gasp* I'm gonna lead my flock to paradise, down streets paved with gold. *Hymn Montage* You'll grow up to sit at the right hand of God. (Me?

Yes, (Lie) Josh was a good name. It was Joshua-James... I had Karen book us out on a flight to Guyana tomorrow. *Sigh* Well I'd like to stay near Gene and the baby for a few days. Why? They're under my protection. you're going to Guyana with me! Bring plenty of money... We're going to open a new mission there! I don't understand what you want mr. Jones... you can do anything you want with the 3,000 acres in the jungle and the followers of your group can come and go as they wish. Yes I know! but we are a special group Colonel, because we believe as you do in the democratic principles of socialism (Jim Jones = Pinko) My flock is constantly persecuted and hounded in the United States everywhere we turn another enemy is attempting to destroy us! The CIA has attempted to infiltrate my flock at least two attempts have been made to assassinate me! What Jim means Colonel Rohez is that we have certain needs. Uhh, you know to protect ourselves. We have no desire to circumvent the laws of your country but we will need to bring in rather large amounts of supplies that might seem unusual to your customs officials. what sort of supplies? Well there's going to be a very large amount of money flowing into your country colonel. To finance our activities for our own people as well as the missionary work that we wish to do elsewhere. I see and what else? We will need certain equipment for our own protection you know how active the CIA has been throughout the Caribbean in Chile Paraguay Cuba Ecuador El Salvador! Guns? (CIA Still there, oh my!) Yes, there will be some guns. *Tsk* *Phew* Well, well well well. You are asking a great deal of a small Marxist republic in the infancy of its revolutionary development. I must think about this long and carefully. (After I shag her.) Of course colonel. I'm certain that you have many questions... Mr. Richie and I are going to inspect the site of our jungle paradise. Miss Bundy is as efficient as she is beautiful and I'm certain that she can answer any questions that you may have. Any questions at all. All right Karen? *Nods, Wink* The colonel will have everything he wants. In the way of information about us. ;) It's so nice of you to come Mrs. Briggs. "Thank you." Mr. Briggs. Actually... It was her mother who persuaded us to come here Mr. Jones. I was very moved by your comments about the suffering of children throughout the globe, especially in Veitnam! "Thank you." I'm grateful your mother. She watches your a television program religiously forgive the pun. *Gasps* my mother seems convinced that your prayers have brought some your healing in services. and would be a benefit to her. What's the nature of her problem? cancer! Yes the doctors say absolutely nothing can be done about it. what do you say? That's a medical myth. I'd like to talk with your mother. She doesn't go to picnics! we're holding a healing service to commemorate the opening of our mission in Guyana. Leave your address and phone number with one of my associates. I'll come and talk to your mother and prepare her for the revelation of faith. And what can I do for you Mr. Jones? Pray with me. (Shag) that's all I'll ever ask! Thank you *Hymn* *Wired on Speed* Now, Will each of you, give a fond embrace to your neighbor? A salutary kiss of greeting. Let's fill the atmosphere with warmth! Love, is a healing weapon! *Cheers* Let's concentrate so that the gifts of the Holy Spirit, might happen! Let us believe! Let us believe! *disingenuous clap* C'mon, C'mon! Give em the strength God! Thank you Jesus! *Hallelujahs* do you have the faith to be healed? Yes. *Cheers* "I believe!" Will you let God, pull this foul cancer from your body!? Yes! Is every fiber of your being turned to faith!? Yesss "Glory!" Then let this foul cancer come out of your body, Now! Now! Now! *Screams* (Holds up prop) Will you look at it! Look at it! A miracle, would you look at at!? A miracle! Praise God! Hallelujah! Would you look at it!? Would you look at the cancer!? God has grace for our new sister Briggs. Hallelujah! A miracle has been done! You don't believe that I have the power? I do believe! Yeah well tell me. I don't care, the hell with them, I believe! My God, my god! Only God could have done what you have done! you are divine... *Feeds God Complex* *Sighs* *Moans* *Kisses* Oh your hands are blessed with miracles aren't they? Yes... My hands hold the power of miracles, I am God! Yes, yes, I know you're God! You're the resurrection of Christ! My divine... If you are my child. "I am!" Hmm? "Yes, I am." I-I adore you, adore you! You must adore me. "I do!" Worship me. Worship? Yes, I worship you! Love? "Oh yes!" Pray with me... *Smooch* *Moan* "I worship you." *Doom!* This weekly Saturday morning broadcast, by the reverend Jim Jones of the People's Temple is brought to you as a public service by this station Jim? Thank you Scott, good morning everyone I'm going to talk this morning about one of the greatest needs of all mankind, Shelter. Handover the votes towards Moscone on Tuesday he's our only hope of preventing the homosexuals from taking over the city. Buddy if we don't stand together for Moscone on Tuesday we're gonna have to stand alone against all those pigs who want to break the heads of every gay guy in this city! several weeks ago on our telecast I spoke to you about the universal human need for shelter there are those among us who do not have it, children the elderly, even the helpless victims of disease and many of those who are considered different because of creed or color or something as private as sexual preference. No shelter for them! Yet they are all God's children that is why I'm particularly grateful to our newly elected mayor for his selection of me, as your housing commissioner. Discipline... discipline discipline discipline we must all have discipline it's the only way that I can have the freedom to extend our wonderful work, through missionary centers to underdeveloped sections of the world! I'm prepared to establish the first of these in the jungle paradise of Guyana! This church! My leadership! These are the only means of survival! Those who forget, must be reminded Again and again of their obligations. They must be punished to expunge their sins. To acknowledge their mistakes and pay for them..... Richard Jefferson stand up!! father Jones! Richard Jefferson was sleeping as you spoke! I'm sorry I... Stand up. that's exactly what I mean, stand up! No, no no no no. Not there in the bosom of your family. Stand where we can see you! Let us all see, who shirks his part in carrying this burden. *Slaps* Are you awake now!? Are you paying attention to our Father? huh!? Huh!? wake up, wake up! Pay attention to what's happening! *Shocked* can you stand before God Richard Jefferson? (Me) And admit that you were sleeping while his message was being brought to you? Do you confess that your faith was so weak?! let me hear you! let us all hear your shame! "I didn't do anything!" that is not remorse, that is not a confession! That's not humility!!! But I was up all night painting the nursery school, you said yourself it had to be done "Dad!" (?) and it was done... You performed a small service. But God doesn't want your small gifts, your minor efforts he wants everything, he wants your body and soul. He wants all of you. Every minute of hour of every day! are you sorry that you couldn't give that to him? Plus to me. Are you SORRY!? *Slaps* Answer our father! *Dad's like, WTF?* *Sniffs* I'm sorry. Louder! louder! *Sniff* I'm sorry!!! What right has he got to have of any, to hit Richard!? Richard shouldn't sleep during the services. Painting's hard work! The boy was up all night. And how many nights has "Dad" been up all night? (On Speed) Look how hard he works he gives everything he has to us he works till he drops! and when he does drop, he drops right into bed with some woman! Otis Jefferson I'm gonna make-believe you didn't say that, I don't want to hear it. This boy broke the rules and he was punished. And I was glad in my heart and soul to see him punished. It'll make him a better Christian! (Not!) *Throws keys, feeling bewildered, hears Richard sobbing* Richard? what's wrong son? *Gasps* Oh no! who did this to you? Tell me! Who did this son? Two of Jones' guys! The ones that are with him all the time! I fell asleep again, sitting on the floor where I was working. They just came by and found me. Jones' said I had to be punished so they beat me! This is worse than the Klan! For God sakes. I couldn't help it papa! I was just so tired, we didn't get back from the meetings till 7:00 in the morning. And I had to go right to work! Let me get some ointment. Then we'll talk about It. Congressman Ryan it's getting worse all the time! The beatings, the women, he's got things happening with 8-10 women in the church, and some say the men too! - I can't believe that anybody listens to him. Then you don't know him. They do anything he says, anytime he says it. Mr. Jefferson you're obviously sincere about this, but you know Jones is considered one of the leading clergymen in this country? The mayor of this city has made him chairman of the Housing Commission. He's active socially and politically. Even the members of your church, come from all walks of life rich and poor. The man you're describing is a monster! It just doesn't make sense. I know it doesn't, once he was a fine man! but something happened to him. (Drugs?) Okay mr. Jefferson Uhh, what we have to do now is think about this, uh check it out. How can we get in touch with you? IIII don't want you calling me, my wife and my children they believe in everything he does. We'll protect your situation why don't you take one of my cards? It's good to meet you. Thank you sir. Well that's a wild one. Yeah! sound like a hot one doesn't it? It's got all the elements! blacks, religion, sex, drugs! Could make headlines all across the country! alright, let's ask the FBI if there's anything unusual in the banking transactions. What, with the Medicaid checks and Social Security checks. You can check the real estate record that's public information. Oh yeah! Let's ask our friends at City Hall, if he's done anything with the Housing Commission, besides load it with members of the church... Patrons asking questions about our bank accounts! Our finances are none of their business! The Registrar of Deeds told me that there was a man in there from congressman Ryan's office looking through the real estate transfer books. This is outrageous! It's obscene, I won't let them crucify me! (I'm God) Well Jim, now there's a major investigation going on at the temple. We don't know why, but it's not gonna be any good to scream about it. who is this "Hound of Hell" named Ryan? Spies! Assassins! Man has asked himself... what would happen if the true son of God returned to earth to create a perfect society? *Alludes to own divinity* Now, WE have the answer... oh yes now we know, for I am here... I have returned, I have brought you miracles. And my reward has been treachery! yes yes yes Oh treachery! I have been a betrayed. who among you has done it? Who is my Judas? look to your neighbors, look to your families. Is it one of them? Is it one of them? "No! not here Lord." Is it one of them? "No!" *Hiding true feelings* If it's painting you want, my day is done. Put that cigarette out! You know better than to be smoking around all this stuff! *Door Slams* *Explosion!* *Judas Eliminated* Hi! *Smooch* You're early! I have to find Jim. We're in trouble! C'mon, tell me who you are. I'm not God! Yes you are! No I'm not! Who are you? Joshua James Ricky. And I am your father (Vader) My daddy is my father! I am THE father! (Luke) I am God! ( Too many amphetamines) Mommy wants you Josh. "Okay." Jim the roof is about to blow! The arson squad is investigating the death of Otis Jefferson... it was an accident. (Lie) Otis was the source for the information being gathered about the temple. Did you know that Jim? Their lies and treachery cannot touch me! (Wacko) (Sad-O-Lantern) Oh God I wish I was dead! But my people what would happen to my people? *Moses fail* *Sighs* Jim, did you know about Otis Jefferson? *Shakes head, then Nods* We won't stay here and let them crucify me! I know what I have to do! The promise land! I'm ready to take you to the promised land! To JONESTOWN!!!!! Yes, Jonestown. Let them persecute, damn us, they will not be able to quench us! *Cheering* "Yes!" "Woooooo!" All is ready. And I will lead you... Now, only 1000 of us. Only 1000 of us, will be able to go in first as pioneers. The rest of you, will be asked to redouble your efforts. Redouble your efforts! To support and supplement OUR efforts, in creating this paradise. "Oh the joy of it!" *Cheers* Praise the Lord will ya? Dear God! Thank you for choosing me, to lead this blessed pilgrimage to a new Holy land! Oh the joy! Yes! *Down by the riverside* *Living in a van!* *Down by the riverside* Anymore! Anymore! anymore... oh Lord! Richard you haven't even started packing yet I'm not going! Mama we got no business going to no jungle! What are we gonna do there? (Eat Bananas?) We're gonna make a paradise to live in! Like Jim Jones said... The trouble with you Richard, is that you made some mistakes, you got punished and it weakened your faith! That's not true Mama! it's just that I got my life to live My life is here, I met a girl I like...and she's come between you and your beliefs? No mama, she was in services last Sunday, and she's gonna get her folks to come! It's just... if I go away now, I'll never see her again our family has never been separated!? Papa's gone and now you... mama mama! look I wish we were all gonna stay here together. but I know you and Raymond are gonna go. and I gotta do what's right for me! It's what Papa would've wanted me to do. *Doesn't know her own dead husband* *Hymn-tage!* This will be our first big harvest, and we'll plant again! Two crops next year! Mr. Jones you are not going to get anything out of this... What do you mean!? We'll grow all the fruits and vegetables we need, and by next year we'll have enough surplus to supply the neighboring villages. *Shakes head* Mr. Jones I am not an agricultural expert. But you have planted up the hill, at the first rains the water will wash down these rows, like small rivers. It will take away everything you have planted. And the topsoil too! Why didn't somebody tell me about these conditions!? You should have asked the Indians in the jungle, they are the only ones who farm this area... all they want to do is steal our supplies! Instead of driving them off, you should have traded them some supplies for information. We will not fail! Mr. Jones, I want to help you all I can. It does our country no good, if your experiment here does not succeed but I cannot help you if you will not listen! This is a jungle! Not a farm in your country! I will make it happen here with God's help! (My Will) *Sighs* Mr. Jones I hope he's listening! *Thunder-claps* Straight ahead, watch your step. "Thank you." I'm so excited! Me too! - I can't wait to see mama and Raymond again. I love you! Richard! How are you? oh I'm so glad to see you finally, finally! Oh, good to see you! This is my wife Alice. Isn't she beautiful? Hello. Hello. "You know I don't think she'd have married me if I hadn't said we come to Jonestown." All right well then let's go! all aboard! Jonestown come on! *Kool-Aid Kommune* Okay! Can I have everybody off please? come on! okay we're gonna collect all your passports and all the other travel documents that you might have. now this is just a simple formality for the Guyanese immigration people. Okay? (Lie) Karen will give you your work assignments all right? see y'all later! You're in residence C. And your work assignment is over there. "Thank you." *Binocular Snooper* *Lust for LeVar Burton's wife* Hi Karen! Welcome Richard! Glad to have you back in the family, both of you it's good to be here my wife alice.

They put us in separate houses what's going on? *Sighs* Richard it's not an easy life we've got here and nobody should come here expecting it. we're trying to build something new. And father Jones says we just have to find new ways of living together! (Abominations) (Doesn't anyone read their Bible!?) excuse me? Could you help me I'm looking for my umm.. What's your number? 679. It's that one right there. Now it's time for the nightly news. CIA agents have been reported very active in all parts of South America particularly in Chile.

Alice, baby what's the matter, what's wrong? did somebody do something to you? Did somebody hurt you? "Nobody hurt me." You're acting so funny. I'm not funny, I just had some little pills for my nerves. I feel fine, Richard really, don't worry about me. Isn't it a beautiful day today? Yeah, baby you better eat something! No, I'm not hungry! Logging Crew let's go everybody on the tractor! let's go! come on Richard that means you! We've got work to do, let's see some action! rise and shine!! see you later okay? *Whistle* Alright! Everybody, 10 minutes! *Sighs* Ahhhhhh! *Phew* I saw Alice... she was drugged man... Alice doesn't take any drugs. They gave her drugs! To deal with all the young women, the attractive ones anyhow... What do you mean? Man I'm telling you they gave her drugs Well why would they do that? *Sighs* To get her under control. No no see you don't understand she was just tired. Jones wanted it man! what do you mean wanted? (School boy) *Scoffs* No! you're lying, you're lyin'! "Hey wait a minute!" You're lying! "Let go!" You're lying! What's goin' on down here!? he said, he said, my wife! He said father Jones! Oh God, God how could he!? Look here! you want to get back to work. or do you want to spend some time in the box? *Blows whistle* Everybody back to work! Let's go! all marriages are dissolved! I will not tolerate any marriages created outside this church... they are illicit, sexually motivated relationships that have no place in this society. You have been mis-matched, and mis-mated. By your baser instincts. I am now ending those relationships and in my knowledge of you, I will designate your appropriate mates! (Orgy King) Damnit! you can't do that! You can't take my wife from me! I know you Richard Jefferson you're a homosexual. That's why your wife has left you. Your one of those dirty little faggots who hang out in the men's room at the bus station. sit down homosexual! I will not sit down! now I want my wife you can't do this to people we came here to help to work for God! You think you can pull this you're crazy! listen to the dirty little fairy! (I'm a hypocrite homo) he wants my body, and I won't give it to him! That's why this woman came to me and told me of his evil lust and stayed with me. (Drugged) Because I am the only truly worthy *I'M DYING* object of your love and your desire! You are crazy! Man you're crazy! You're nuts! There is a faggot brother. Throw him in the box! Put them in the box! Let them lie down side by side for 48 hours and see if the big queers will attack the faith again, throw them in the box! PUT THEM IN THE BOX! *Sobbing* Oh God! They're full of stories about the temple what do they say? Oh mostly innuendos and rumors, you know. what did they say!? *Sigh* Well there's been some interviews with Ryan and uhh... some people of the relatives of Jonestown. What are they talking about!? Just some stuff about real estate transactions now don't be upset! But Jim they want you off the housing commission. Tell them I resigned! Because of this vicious plot perpetrated to destroy me and all my work! It would be better to be dead, than to see them destroy everything we've worked for all these years! if they're sending mercenaries after us, they won't like the reception they get! We'll DIE! Before we give up our struggle! Tell the faithful, we'll stand together! Against these lies! Now Jim you better come back here and make an appearance! Or else they're gonna say you're hiding! If I come back they'll send me to prison for the rest of my LIFE! I'm creating a UTOPIA! And they're determined to destroy it! and me with it, I'll never come back!!! *Tosses Mic.* Jim? Now listen to me! *Slams Door* *Queen Wave* *Wet Smooching* *Hugz* *Deep sigh* Here, let me take that. How's Joshua? He's umm... he's alright, he's alright. *Sigh* Is Jim as out of control as he sounds on the radio? No, he's worse than that sometimes Clayton... I'm not with him anymore, he's taken the wife of a young man... *Sigh* I want Josh out of here! newspapers and television in San Francisco, have been murdering us. remember David's wife? Yeah? she's been talking to Ryan... oh my God, that might break him completely (Jim) It's time we get out Gene. I know... *Engine turns over* *Medical treatment for "God"* Clayton, Clayton! My health is falling apart! I can't stand the pressure! I wrote the Russians to send me two medical specialists... can't trust anybody from the United States, the CIA has got them all in it's pockets.(True) Jim there's another $200,000 in the case here. We need every cent! Our only protection is gifts for the faithful! Gene, take this money to Brazil open a new account. We've got to keep it hidden from the CIA *Paranoid delusions?* *Sigh* Jim this congressman has been investigating the temple, they've spread stories that people are being kept here against their will... *Scoffs* There are no prisoners here they all love me! Jim they say that uhh, messages have been smuggled out attacking you and everything about this place. They call it an armed camp.. oh my God! My God my God my God! perfidious foul traitors!! They've infiltrated us! Spies and mercenaries! come to me children, come to me children! come to the sheltering arms of the Lord. Let me protect you. I'd rather see you dead. I'd rather see us all dead. Than imprisoned, tortured, vile evil warriors of hatred are descending upon us. Jim I want to take Joshua back with me. No no no! well it's time he went to school Jim... He goes to school here! He's learning more here than he'll ever know, at the hands of the imperialist traitors! all they'll do is teach him more their rotten lies! Well I want to take him back!!! NEVER! He is my son! He is the Prince of the church, he sits at the right hand of God! Well Jim I am NOT going to let you do this! you can't tell me what to do! *Voice Crack* you are a disciple, don't become my Judas... I'll take care of this Jim. Josh? "Bye..." *Waves* we're both getting out, now! I don't think we'll ever see Josh again! our only hope Gene. Is through some kind of legal help, if we tried to take him out now none of us will get out of here alive. Cain? Tell me... You goin' somewhere? yeah Jim wants Gene to take that to Brazil, and I'm gonna take her to the airport. Thank you. *Coughs* Operator? operator!? *Clicks phone* Operator!? I'm trying to get through to San Francisco congressman Leo Ryan's office Georgetown Guyana. Thank You! congressman Ryan? Congressman Ryan this is Clayton Ritchie I'm calling you from Georgetown Guyana. Well I've been the business manager of the People's Temple for many years and uh well I'll tell you everything you want to know about it. If you'll just help me take some kind of legal action to get my son back. Jim Jones has him. yes sir mr. Ryan I strongly urge you to come down here and see for yourself just what's going on at Jonestown! there are traitors among us... turncoats despicable tools of the CIA. Who think they can send down spies disguised as congressmen... you will not prevail, you will not prevail! Even today a traitor among us has tried to take my son from me, with a cruel and savage legal action well in Georgetown but I tell you now, I tell the world now only death can take him from me, and death is no more than a step toward the eternal life of peace which we'll all share one day.... Death is life eternal DEATH is life! *Wakes Bro* *Door Creeks* Shhh... Listen little brother, I got to get out of here! I'm gonna take my wife and get out! There's no way, the trails all through the jungle are patrolled by guards... They'll get ya for sure. but if they don't the snakes will! What a nightmare! but you never wake up... what can I do?! Jim Jones is gone crazy and if you keep fighting this you're gonna go crazy too! your parents? they'll help! how can I get a message out? you can't trust anybody around here. Hey! what are you guys doing back here oh well umm, going to the toilet... what does anybody do here? You know you're not supposed to be back here this late. well don't tell me! *Huh* tell my kidneys. *heh* Maybe we'll tell father Jones and see if some discipline isn't in order... Mom? Hmm? You know that uh... that congressman is coming down here... uh-huh... well if anybody wants to go back with him. They can if they want. I don't want to hear anything about that Raymond. Mom we have got to get outta here! I want us all to go! Help me, please... You're asking me to help you wrong, Jim Jones I can't do that! The trouble with you Raymond is that you were too little to know how it was before Jim Jones helped us, we owe our lives to that man! (Like Christ) I am never leaving Jonestown and if you do I guess I just lost a son... Is the Peoples Temple receiving Medicare, welfare and other government.. Have you spoken directly to Jim Jones? about your visit to Jonestown? - no comment Jane we're sorry. Sorry? Where's my mother? She's in the foam room. she dead? Yes, she is. Now let's go talk to father... I don't want to talk to him! I don't want to see him! Jane we have to accept this! He cheated her! he lied to her! said he cured her, he didn't cure her! "Marcy!" (Death by cancer) You took my money, you took me! Jane, come on Jane, we're going to give you an injection. You took everything! I want my ma. Relax for a moment. Is my Mother dead? Yes. Yes. Give me your arm Jane. we're gonna give you an injection, jane we're going to give you an injection. It's okay we've just gotten clearance from Jones to go onto Jonestown. *Sighs* Is the plane ready? yeah there's a charter waiting at the airport Connors you sure you want to go? We're sure. Do you think Jones is gonna react strongly to seeing you Since you both quit the temple? Gene discussed it and we'll fly with you to port "?Cartoom?" and wait for you there. Let's go. Congressman Ryan how do you defend this investigation against charges that you're meddling with freedom of religious choice? Look Jim Jones is down here in a South American jungle with a thousand of my constituents, I am pledged to their protection and well-being we've had reports that some are being held against their will. I intend to find out, if that's the case believe me I'm not coming down here with any preconceived notions. Do you have any comment about the public officials back home who openly support Jim Jones and the People's Temple? no comment. The first time my wife went to a People's Temple function it was a picnic she became a fanatic follower of Jim Jones. Gave him a fortune even sold all her jewelry, that broke up our marriage when she followed him to Guyana. the stories about drugs at Jonestown congressman do you intend to go into that? Now we don't know if any of those stories are true, we're going to find out. actually I've heard from sources I trust in San Francisco that Jones got a lot of kids off drugs! we have no verification of that either. That is true... my husband David Langtry was strung out on heroin when we first joined the People's Temple and we tried everything to get him off but nothing really seemed to work. Jim Jones got him off heroin. You must be very grateful to Jim Jones? I wish I had the guts to kill him!!! hello I'm congressman Leo Ryan from California. Yeah we know who you are! All right let's go see mr. Jones. Not all these people... I thought this had already been cleared. with uh, with mr. Jones. The only thing I know about is you mr. Daniells and mr. Briggs mr. Holloway. *Points* That girl, I don't know anything about them. And I mostly don't know anything about those two! mr. and mrs. Richie don't plan to accompany us these others are reporters they expect to be able to talk with mr. Jones and visit your encampment. You can forget about it because we don't want that many people around. The Guyanese authorities in Georgetown have told these reporters they're free to go wherever they wish! Jonestown, this is Jonestown. Father Jones makes the rules. You coming or not? All right everyone we're free to go. All the relatives, press, I'm sorry you're going to stay here for the time being. I want to get a clearance for you as soon as I see mr. Jones *Takes off coat in Jungle finally* Welcome to Jonestown! "Thank you." Congressman Ryan, I'm Marceline Jones. Pleased to meet you. pleased to meet you. my husband's uh, looking forward to meeting you. Would you follow me? Mr. Jones. I'm Leo Ryan. Welcome congressman, welcome to Jonestown! welcome all of you! I'm sorry I wasn't at the airstrip to greet you but I've had a touch of jungle fever and I wanted to save all my strength to talk with you. If you'll all just sit down my people will want to come and talk with you and we'll have your relatives brought here too. - we have some reporters with us they weren't allowed to come here. I thought it might make everyone uncomfortable having them looking around might be more uncomfortable to have them say that you were trying to hide something/ I have nothing to hide! Perry! "Yeah?" Send somebody after the reporters! "Joel! Oh thank God you've come!"(Inaudible) Mama died! I'm sorry, I'm sorry Joel get me out of here yeah? Yeah alright, you're coming home. *Phew* This woman is hysterical, she's shocked by the quite natural death of her mother, Cancer! She had cancer! And you said you cured her, you didn't! He lied! Did you hear me? Now get away from me, don't you touch me! I did cure her. She lost her faith and the disease was waiting to attack again! *Chuckles* There was no faith!? No faith oh my God!? See congressman that's just part of my work trying to maintain the faith of the weaker souls who came down here expecting a paradise to be built overnight without a lot of hard work. *Sigh* Yeah I'll show you around our facility. We have someone in charge of each one, to answer any questions that you may have. "Good." We've had 31 children born here in Jonestown without any complications. I'm a registered nurse and never met a finer doctor than dr. Lantry You've got a great deal to be proud of Mrs. Jones! oh yes I certainly do! This stays locked until after Ryan and his people leave, all right? Mom look at this! salad, FRIED CHICKEN! Mashed potatoes, vegetables! Cake! It'd be nice to have visitor's all the time!? mm-hmm!!! *Chatter* I must admit mr. Jones I came down here expecting to find a hellhole in the jungle and everything I see indicates to me that you've got a well organized very comfortable encampment here. Thank you very much mr. Ryan! *Kids Singing* *Kinda weirded out* *David is loving it!* *Uh-oh something's happening* *Lights Cigar* (Not Cuban) Hey, if that congressman is going to ask if there's anyone who wants to get out of here. What'd suppose that is a private party over there? Do you want to leave? I don't want to be seen talking to you now, but don't go out that gate without me I'll give you a story that'll blow this place apart! Where do you keep those locked boxes Joe? Out in the jungle, on the other side of buildings we eat in. Uh-huh well... why don't you just stash our friend there for a while until this is over. okay? I feel wonderful! Oh God! "David?" How are you? I'm all right I'm very busy but alright. why did you come here? Would you believe I'm still your wife? I love you. What? *Stammers* I mean it's been so long I thought you'da met somebody else, maybe even gotten married! David haven't you had enough of this? I can help you, you can go back and be a real doctor. Doctor? Don't you understand what's happened to me? I'm a real human being. I've actually saved lives! I've cured people! I've stopped pain! I-I've worked miracles that Jim couldn't fake, at a thousand healing ceremonies! And I've done it with these hands with this mind and with my body and my soul we're building something beautiful here Sheila! If only our enemies would leave us alone! David don't use that on me? You're not alive, you're living a memory! I am this moment and I have been from the first moment I heard Jim's voice and I will be until the last moment I hear him speak. These attacks on me are all lies every leader with a vision has to go through that. Tell me about these real estate transactions. It's really very simple members of my flock make contributions to the temple. Nothing wrong with that! Not one of them is out on the street they've all been provided for. What about these claims we've heard of sexual abuses? Hasn't every leader, every prominent man in the world been subjected as if outrageous gossip? this includes, names, places, dates. Seems like more than gossip! all right, I have……. committed one indiscretion in my entire married life. (Lie) The guilt of that still haunts me, except that it led to the birth of my most beautiful son Joshua and it's led to this despicable legal action as you know. but believe me Mr. Ryan. Please... that's what about all that's holy I've never permitted myself I remember on my congregation to commit any acts *Scoffs* why am I so persecuted? Is there no peace for me anywhere in the world? heaven pity a simple gospel, that have I created so many enemies. Why do people hate me when all I've ever tried to do was good people!? so painful! So painful! Mr. Jones, I am merely trying to find out what's going on here on behalf of almost a thousand of my constituents who happen to be members of your flock. There the constituents of God and Jim Jones. children our fine outstanding congressman has come all the way down here to find out if I'm a sex maniac. "No!" To find out if I'm holding you prisoner "No!" I want you to tell them what our live are like! And after you told them the truth about what our lives are like here. perhaps they'll go away, and leave us in peace! Notice the guards!? I think we outta get the hell outta here! here's my flock, talk to them all you want. ask them if I destroyed their lives by leading them from poverty neglect and anguish! I think we've seen enough mr. Jones I'm ready to go back to port "?Kytoom?" Now with those of your group that want to go with us. No no no no! I want you to stay. Marcy! Find beds for the esteemed congressional investigator and his assistant! May have your attention please! everyone when we leave here tomorrow, any of you that want to go with us will be escorted back to the United States in comfort and safety! If any more of you want to go with us just step forward right now. *Scoff* The lies they'll tell about us now! Don't let them go, we can keep them here! Were just a handful of people what difference does that make they'll be back you know, with troops to wipe us out! and we can stop, them we can stop them now! before they have a chance to hurt us! I'm not gonna let them do this to you, I'm not gonna let them do it... it's too late! just let them go! Please do something to protect yourself! Something, tell me what to do! TELL ME! *Kisses hand* don't hurt them! Do something! it's all over! it's all over! I've been betrayed! Send David to me I don't feel well... ask everybody to come to the pavilion I have to talk to them! bring me my family! bring me my family! come to me children. come to the pavilion, everybody to come to the pavillion. Bring your families, let's all come to the pavillion for ne final moment together! huh? sounds like "dad" wants us to have another one of his loyalty tests... it's time to leave all our fears and frustrations behind it's timeto take the final step together to eternal life. Oh I love you! I love ya, I love ya all! That's right bringing families everyone come to the pavillion. That's right. I want all my children to come to the pavillion. For one final moment. Hurry, hurry my children please hurry! In spite of all that I've tried a handful of our people with their lies, have made our life impossible! there's no way to detach ourselves from what's happened today we're sitting here waiting on a powder keg hurry hurry my children please hurry "18 (Scoops?)" We have been so betrayed, we've been so terribly betrayed... are we all here? how very much I've tried to give you a good life. it's been said by the greatest Prophets since time immemorial no man takes my life from me! I lay my life down!! *David Worries* If we can't live in peace. Then let's die in peace! Now what's going to happen here in a few minutes, is that one of our people is going to shoot the people who left. I didn't tell em to do it. I didn't plan it! but I know it's going to happen. That's just as plain as I can tell ya! and I've never lied to you I never have lied to you. (What a lie) so my opinion is, you be kind to children, you be kind to seniors, and you take the potion like they did in ancient Greece and step over quietly because we're not committing suicide it's a revolutionary act! The people in San Francisco will not be ilde over this. They'll not take our deaths in vain. You know. Jenny, jenny jenny Jenny Jenny!! What about Russia? is it too late for Russia? it's too late, it's too late, those people are out there! They're out there with the guns, I can't control them and once they kill anybody *Stammers* you think you think Russia is going to want us? with all this stigma? before we had value. but now we have no value to them! Well I feel like that as long as there's life there's hope! That's my faith! *Scoff* Sooner or later that hope runs out cuz everybody dies I never saw anybody yet who didn't die... now I-I'd like to choose my own kind of death for a change because I'm tired of being tormented to hell! That's what I'm tired of! I'm Tired! Tired! "Yeah, but Dad?" but Dad, I'd like to choose mine too - it's not that I'm afraid to die! I know you're not... It's just that, I look around at all these children, and I think they deserve to live! I agree but don't they deserve much more don't they deserve peace? Sister (Inaudible) You are standing here today because he was here in first place. your life has been expended to this day because oh him! *Oh Shit!? What have I Done!?* Paul says there's a man born out of due season, well I have been born out of due season. Just like we are and the best test or burden, we can make is to leave this God damn world! Lookout, this up, pour pour! Stop stop! "Dad, dad?" Dad I just want to say, you were the only one who helped me when nobody else would, and if you want me to die because you want us to die today, I'll do it for you, we'll all go for you! *Hair dye running* The congressman has been MURDERED!

Now you children, I want you to lug up those little children and start administering them. They're not crying out of any pain. It's only a little bitter tasting. (Cyanide HURTS) I just want to say something to everybody who is standing around, or crying! This is nothing to cry about! This is something that we can all rejoice about! *Murdering Infants* :( I have had a gorgeous life! I've had a beautiful life! So you should be happy! I know I am! Thank God almighty! Thank God Almighty! *Cyanide Pains of Death* I don't care how many screams you hear, I don't care how many cries of anguish! Death is a million times, preferable than 10 more days in this life! I strongly maintain, go lay down your burdens, im gonna let down my burdens! Down by the riverside! Shall we lay them down here? (Inaudible) Inside of Guyana, what's the difference!? we've lived as no other people have lived, and loved. We've had about as much of this world as you're gonna get! Don't be afraid to die! You've seen people's (Inaudible) out there! They'll torture our seniors! They'll torture our children. We cannot have this! Please can we hasten? Can we hasten with our medication!? Please Please. Lets get gone, lets get gone! Lets get gone! "finish it all, it won't hurt." *Sobs* They killed Mama! All the hypodermic needles have been used. (Inaudible) Ok. Wait up! Do I have to Dad?

I tried so very very hard we used to sing this world this world it's not our home well it sure isn't, we're going to set an example for others, a thousand people who said: we don't like the way the world is! Take our life from us we laid it down we got tired... we didn't commit suicide. We commited a revolutionary act of suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane WORLD!
