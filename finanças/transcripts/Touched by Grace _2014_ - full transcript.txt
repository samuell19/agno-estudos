APPARENTLY YOU'VE BEEN REALLY BUSY! EVERY YEAR, I SET GOALS FOR MYSELF. LAST SPRING IT WAS... WHAT WAS IT QUINN? STAR IN THE SCHOOL PLAY, LAND A RECORDING CONTRACT, AND BECOME STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT. YOU DID ALL THAT IN JUST ONE YEAR? AND SHE EVEN HELPED ME BECOME STUDENT BODY SECRETARY. SHOOT FOR THE MOON... LAND AMONG THE STARS. (CARA) WOW. [WHISPERS] HER DAD PAID FOR THE RECORDING SESSIONS. HE'S LIKE LOADED. BUT, THIS YEAR, SENIOR YEAR, I HAVE TO SET EVEN BIGGER GOALS THAN EVER BEFORE. IF I'M GOING TO MAKE MY MARK ON THE UNIVERSE, I HAVE TO START BY CONQUERING MY OWN HIGH SCHOOL FIRST. STARTING WITH GOAL NUMBER ONE, THE REASON WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. I WANT TO GET A HOMECOMING DATE WITH BRAD MICHAELS. (QUINN) WHAT ABOUT KEN? I'M DONE WITH HIM. (CARA) EASY! QUINN, GIVE ME YOUR TRAY. EXCUSE ME? JUST GIVE ME YOUR TRAY. MUSTARD. OH, MY GOSH! NO! NO WAY! EXCUSE ME. BRAD, IS IT? MY FRIEND SKYLAR'S TRAY IS DIRTY. I'LL GET YOU A NEW ONE.

LOSER. * [MUSIC] THIRDLY, YOU SHOULD LEARN RIGHT NOW, THAT IF I DON'T GO TO SOMETHING, IT'S PROBABLY LAME. GOAL NUMBER ONE: GET A HOMECOMING DATE WITH BRAD MICHAELS, CAPTAIN OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM. CHECK. THANKS TO YOU! GOAL NUMBER TWO. BECOME HOMECOMING QUEEN. FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. SOUNDS DO-ABLE. GOAL NUMBER THREE? PULL OFF THE BIGGEST BADDEST SENIOR PRANK IN THE HISTORY OF GREENBRIAR HIGH. LAST YEAR OUR JUNIOR CLASS FLOAT WAS JUST AWFUL, SO SKYLAR ORGANIZED A GROUP OF GUYS WHO TRASHED THE FRESHMAN AND SOPHOMORE FLOATS AND MADE IT LOOK LIKE THE SENIORS DID IT. THEY GOT IN SOOOOOO MUCH TROUBLE, AND SKYLAR EVEN HAD TO GIVE AN ADDRESS TO THE STUDENT BODY ABOUT THE DANGERS OF BULLYING AND PRANKING. IT WAS EPIC! WE DID SOMETHING LIKE THAT LAST YEAR. THERE WAS THIS KID THAT NOBODY LIKED, AND SO WE RAN THIS BIG CAMPAIGN TO GET HIM VOTED INTO THE TALENT COMPETITION. ONCE HE GOT IN, WE RIGGED THE VOTES, MADE HIM THE WINNER, AND TAUGHT HIM THIS RIDICULOUS VICTORY DANCE ROUTINE. WE MADE HIM LOOK LIKE SUCH A FOOL IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE SCHOOL! IT WAS THE FUNNIEST PRANK EVER. [BELL RINGS] HEY QUINN, I LIKE THIS KID! STUFF LIKE THAT IS GENIUS. TELL YOU WHAT. IF YOU HELP ME PULL OFF THE REST OF MY GOALS. I'LL MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE BEST FALL SEMESTER OF YOUR LIFE. YOU IN? * [MUSIC] * [MUSIC] * YO! YO! * YOU THINK YOU STANDIN' IN THE MIDDLE OF DROUGHT * * BUT THE FLOODS AND THE RAINS GONNA WASH YOU OUT * * 'CAUSE A CARDBOARD HOUSE AIN'T GONNA KEEP YOU WARM * * YOU BETTER BUILD ON THE ROCK AND YOU'LL WEATHER THE STORM * * 'CAUSE IT'S ON THE LOOSE YEAH, IT'S COMING DOWN * * YOU BETTER BUILD YOUR HOUSE ON SOLID GROUND * * [MUSIC] * THERE AIN'T NO TIME FOR CORRALS * * [MUSIC] * WHEN YOU'RE LIVIN' IN A CARDBOARD HOUSE * NO WAY. WRITE IT. GIVE IT TO CARA, SHE'S THE ART NERD. WHAT IS THIS? PERFECT. [CHUCKLES] [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] ADAM! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU KNOW...I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW, GO OVER THERE SIT DOWN, RIGHT NOW. OKAY CLASS, SETTLE DOWN! AS YOU KNOW, TODAY IS THE DAY WHEN WE NOMINATE ONE GIRL FOR THE HOMECOMING COURT. ONCE THE COURT IS CHOSEN, THE ENTIRE SCHOOL SELECTS THE HOMECOMING QUEEN. DO ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY NOMINATIONS? I AM GOING TO TAKE TWO, AND AT THE END WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR ONE, HOPE THAT'S NOT TOO HARD FOR YOU. ANY NOMINATIONS? I NOMINATE MY HOT HOMECOMING DATE, SKYLAR. GIRLFRIEND! MY HOT GIRLFRIEND, SKYLAR. SHOCKER! (TEACHER) OKAY, DOES ANYONE SECOND SKYLAR'S NOMINATION? ALL RIGHT WE HAVE ONE NOMINATION. DOES ANYONE ELSE WANT TO MAKE A NOMINATION THIS MORNING? YES, QUINN. I WOULD LIKE TO NOMINATE GRACE YOUNG. I THINK THAT HAVING A STUDENT LIKE GRACE ON OUR HOMECOMING COURT WOULD BE A POSITIVE STATEMENT TO OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCEPTANCE, TOLERANCE, AND DIVERSITY. QUINN, THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL IDEA! DOES SOMEONE WANT TO SECOND GRACE'S NOMINATION? (TEACHER) GREAT! (WHISPERS) WHAT ARE YOU DOING? MAKING SURE SKYLAR MAKES THE COURT, DUMMY. SKYLAR'S A JERK. VOTE FOR GRACE. SPREAD THE WORD. (TEACHER) OKAY, IF EVERYONE COULD WRITE ON THEIR PIECES OF PAPER, MAKE YOUR CHOICES THEN PASS THEM FORWARD. REMEMBER YOUR VOTE IS ANONYMOUS. THANK YOU... THANK YOU! WOW! OKAY, THEN! OUR CLASS NOMINEE TO THE HOMECOMING COURT IS GRACE YOUNG! OKAY GUYS, YOU KNOW THE DRILL. WE NEED TO CREATE SOME REALLY ROCKIN' HOMECOMING POSTERS AND DECORATIONS, SO LET'S GET TO WORK. DID MRS. A. JUST SAY "ROCKIN'"? [CHUCKLES] SO, LET ME GUESS. YOUR CLASS NOMINATED SKYLAR. [UPSET SIGH] - BRANDON... - WHAT? YOU'RE AN IDIOT. WHAT DID I SAY? SKYLAR GOT BEAT OUT BY RETARD GIRL. DUDE, DON'T SAY IT LIKE THAT. SHE'S GOT A NAME. AND CALLING SOMEONE A RETARD IS NOT OKAY. FINE. SKYLAR AND QUINN NOMINATED GRACE SO THAT SKYLAR WOULD WIN, AND IT BACK-FIRED... BIG TIME. GRACE IS ON THE HOMECOMING COURT? [SIGHS] YEP, NOW INSTEAD OF TAKING THE HOMECOMING QUEEN, I'M STUCK TAKING THE DRAMA QUEEN. YES, SHE'S DEFINITELY THE DEFINITION OF A D.Q., AND YOU KNEW THAT BEFORE YOU ASKED HER OUT. SHE ASKED ME, AND SHE'S HOT, SO... SPEAKING OF HOT, WHO ARE YOU TAKING? YOU BETTER GET ON THAT IF YOU WANT TO BE PART OF OUR GROUP. I WAS THINKING ABOUT ASKING CARA. CARA?! I'M PRETTY SURE SHE'S TAKEN. REALLY? WHY WOULDN'T SHE BE? SHE'S SMOKING. I'D TRADE CARA FOR SKYLAR ANY DAY. SHE'S HOT WITHOUT THE ISSUES. HEY, WHAT KIND OF SHOES DO GIRLS WEAR? ISSUES! SHE'S COMING. NOW, WHERE WERE WE? DAD! SEVENTEEN YEARS, AND YOU'RE STILL FALLING FOR THAT TRICK. THIS CAME FOR YOU TODAY. IT'S FROM MADISON. PERFECT. I'M SO SORRY, CARA. EH, I KNEW IT WAS OVER.

WELL THANK YOU, CARA. THIS IS WONDERFUL. YOU GIRLS ENJOY YOURSELVES NOW! SO, DID YOU HEAR THAT OUR CLASS NOMINATED YOU AS HOMECOMING PRINCESS? A PRINCESS? ME? I CAN GO TO HOMECOMING?

[CHUCKLES] WELL IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE A LITTLE LATE TODAY. WE'VE GOT QUITE A LARGE MESS TO CLEAN UP. [KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK] MRS. HARRIS? YES. I'M SHARON JARVIS WE MET... (MRS. HARRIS) YES, THE OTHER NIGHT HOMECOMING, PICTURES AND THE LIMO. RIGHT, WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SKYLAR. WELL, COME ON IN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? THE GIRLS...WE... WE WANTED TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU, AND TO GRACE. WE BROUGHT ROSES FROM S.G.A. AND BALLOONS. CARA SAID THAT GRACE LIKES ROSES AND BALLOONS. WE'RE REALLY SORRY, MRS. YOUNG. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME THE ROSES, AND YOU GO BACK HOME. CAN WE SEE HER? THIS IS THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. FAMILY ONLY. (SKYLAR) ICU? I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST AN ASTHMA ATTACK. SKYLAR! NO. IT IS MUCH MORE SERIOUS THAN THAT. GRACE HAS NEEDED A NEW HEART FOR A LONG, LONG TIME AND WE WERE HOPING IT WOULD LAST A LITTLE LONGER, BUT... HER OLD HEART IS GIVING OUT AND WE STILL HAVEN'T FOUND A DONOR. MRS. YOUNG, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT CARA REALLY DOES CARE ABOUT GRACE. I...DIDN'T... I MEAN I WOULDN'T... SHE'S MY FRIEND. FRIEND? YOU CALL YOURSELF A FRIEND AFTER WHAT YOU DID TO HER? SKYLAR HAS SOMETHING TO TELL YOU. IT WAS ALL MY IDEA, OKAY? CARA HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. I NEVER WANTED TO HURT GRACE. YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME. WHETHER I BELIEVE YOU OR NOT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU DID HURT HER. ALL OF YOU. I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS. SKYLAR! I'M SO, SO SORRY... HERE. I HAVE TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO GRACE. I HAVE TO MAKE THIS RIGHT. JUST ONE SECOND. PLEASE? I THINK YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH. (CARA) CAN I JUST GIVE HER THE ROSES AND BALLOONS? MRS. YOUNG... WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT HERE. FINE, YOU CAN SEE HER. BUT CARA, IF YOU DO ANYTHING, ANYTHING, TO HURT MY BABY GIRL... I WON'T, I WON'T I PROMISE. (MRS. YOUNG) IT'S ROOM 233 THANK YOU, MRS. YOUNG. * [MUSIC] * [MUSIC] * [MUSIC] GRACE. IT'S ME, CARA. OH, CARA! I MISSED YOU SO MUCH. I BROUGHT YOU ROSES AND BALLOONS. I LOVE THEM, AND I LOVE YOU. YOU'RE THE BEST FRIEND EVER. THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE ME. ANY BUTTERFLIES YET? NOT YET, BUT SOON. THEY'RE SLEEPING. CARA? YES. IF THEY WAKE UP BEFORE I GET OUT OF THE HOSPITAL, WILL YOU GIVE MY TALK FOR ME? WILL YOU TELL EVERYONE ABOUT THE BUTTERFLIES? GRACE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT. YOU'LL BE OUT OF HERE SOON. BRANDON SAID THAT EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING AT ME, THAT I REALLY WAS HOMECOMING QUEEN. YOU SURE WERE. HE SAID I WON BECAUSE MY FRIENDS VOTED FOR ME. I'M A TERRIBLE FRIEND. I'M SO SORRY EVERYONE LAUGHED AT YOU, GRACE. THAT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. THAT'S OKAY, CARA. NO, IT'S NOT OKAY. NO ONE SHOULD EVER BE MADE FUN OF FOR BEING THE WAY THEY ARE. CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME? I'M YOUR FRIEND. THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS DO. JESUS FORGAVE ME. SO, OF COURSE, I FORGIVE YOU. DON'T CRY, CARA. YOU ARE FORGIVEN. EVERYTHING IS ALL BETTER NOW. DON'T CRY. PROMISE? CROSS MY HEART. HERE, GRACE. THIS IS SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN TO YOU A LONG TIME AGO, BECAUSE YOU WE'RE THE FIRST REAL FRIEND I HAVE EVER HAD. SEE? IT MATCHES MINE, AND SAYS, "ST ENDS." WHEN YOU PUT THE TWO PIECES TOGETHER... IT SAYS, "BEST FRIENDS." BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE TO ME. YOU'RE THE BEST FRIEND EVER. NO, GRACE. YOU'RE THE BEST FRIEND EVER. I'M GOING TO SLEEP NOW AND I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. * [MUSIC] * ARE YOU WAITING FOR ME THERE * * SITTING IN YOUR GOLDEN CHAIR * * WILL THE GATES BE OPEN WIDE * * WHEN I CROSS THAT GREAT DIVIDE * * IS THERE ROOM THERE AT THE END * * FOR THOSE WHO RECOGNIZE THEIR SIN * * WILL I ASCEND OR WILL I FALL * * ONCE I SCALE THAT FINAL WALL * * GRACE ELUDES ME HERE * THE PATH IS NEVER CLEAR * FOR THIS HEART HAS TURNED TO STONE * * I'M COMIN' HOME, I'M COMIN' HOME * * I'M COMIN' HOME * [MUSIC] * I HAVE QUESTIONED DESTINY * WHAT LIES AHEAD IS HARD TO SEE * * IS THERE PURPOSE DESTINY... I NEVER KNEW GRACE HAD SO MANY FRIENDS. * IS THERE TRUTH FOR THOSE WHO WAIT * * WILL THE BLIND BE SHOWN THE WAY * INTERNATIONALLY RENOWNED NURSE AND JOURNALIST, CLAIRE RAYNER, ONCE STATED THAT "THE HARD FACTS ARE THAT IT IS COSTLY "IN TERMS OF HUMAN EFFORT, COMPASSION, ENERGY, "AND FINITE RESOURCES SUCH AS MONEY, "TO CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH HANDICAPS. "PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT YET PARENTS SHOULD ASK THEMSELVES "IF THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO INFLICT SUCH BURDENS ON OTHERS, "HOWEVER WILLING THEY ARE THEMSELVES "TO TAKE THEIR SHARE OF THE BURDEN IN THE BEGINNING." THIS PHILOSOPHY HAS BEEN ECHOED THROUGHOUT MOST SO-CALLED ADVANCED CIVILIZATIONS. IN FACT, BECAUSE OF THIS PHILOSOPHY, OVER 90 PERCENT OF DOWN SYNDROME BABIES ARE ABORTED BEFORE THEY EVER HAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE A BREATH. BUT, WE ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN THE WORDS OF I CORINTHIANS 1:27: "THAT GOD CHOSE THE FOOLISH THINGS OF THIS WORLD "TO SHAME THE WISE; "GOD CHOSE THE WEAK THINGS OF THIS WORLD TO SHAME THE STRONG." AND WE ARE HERE BECAUSE ONE OF THE WEAK THINGS ONE OF THE LEAST IN THIS WORLD, GRACE ELIZABETH YOUNG, TOUCHED OUR LIVES WITH THE BRIGHTNESS OF HER STRENGTH. AND CHANGED OUR LIVES FOREVER WITH THE LIGHT OF JESUS SHINING IN HER SMILE. LET'S PRAY. * [MUSIC] * [MUSIC] CARA! CARA! HOLD ON JUST ONE SECOND? I HAVE SOMETHING TO GIVE YOU. HOLD ON. GRACE WANTED YOU TO HAVE THESE. SHE DID? BUT I... SHE WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THEM AND SHE SAID, YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO. I BURIED HER IN THE OTHER HALF OF THAT NECKLACE. I HOPE THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S MORE THAN OKAY. CARA, YOU ARE FORGIVEN. PIZZA PARTY TONIGHT, 7:47, GRACE YOUNG'S HOUSE. YOU COMING? I DON'T KNOW. YOU'LL NEVER KNOW UNTIL YOU TRY! MAYBE, WE'LL SEE. * [MUSIC] * [MUSIC] GOING TO DO MY HOMEWORK, MOM. SOUNDS GOOD. * [MUSIC] * [MUSIC] GRACE. MOM! WHAT TIME IS IT? (MOM) 7:45 ISH... WHY? CARA! WHERE ARE YOU GOING? DON'T WORRY MOM, I'M JUST GOING TO GRACE'S HOUSE. I'LL BE BACK IN LESS THAN AN HOUR. THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE GOT TO DO. [CHATTER] [CHATTER] CARA! I AM SO GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT! I DIDN'T KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE FROM SCHOOL CAME OUT TO THIS. YEAH! IT'S SO MUCH FUN, AND EVERYBODY'S SO NICE. JUST WAIT. YOU'LL LOVE IT. OKAY GUYS WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED. AS SOME OF YOU KNOW GRACE WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE HER TESTIMONY TONIGHT, BUT, I THOUGHT... MAY I SAY SOMETHING? UM... IT'S ABOUT GRACE. IT'S SOMETHING SHE ASKED ME TO DO. I KNOW I'M NEW HERE, AND ALL OF YOU THINK THAT EVERYTHING I DID AT HOMECOMING WAS MEANT TO HURT GRACE. BUT ACTUALLY GRACE WAS A REAL TRUE FRIEND TO ME. BEFORE SHE DIED ALL GRACE COULD TALK ABOUT WAS HER FRIENDS HERE AT YOUNG LIFE. AND AS MUCH AS SHE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO HOMECOMING. I THINK SHE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING YOU ALL HERE AT HER HOUSE MOST OF ALL. I HADN'T COME TO YOUNG LIFE BEFORE TONIGHT BECAUSE... WELL...I WAS AFRAID OF WHAT A FEW PEOPLE THOUGHT OF ME. BUT I WAS WRONG. I WAS LOOKING FOR THE WRONG KIND OF FRIENDSHIP, WHEN GRACE KEPT TRYING TO SHOW AND TELL ME WHAT TRUE FRIENDSHIP SHOULD LOOK LIKE ALL ALONG. THESE ARE GRACE'S BUTTERFLIES. WHEN I FIRST LOOKED AT THEM, ALL I COULD SEE WAS HOW BROWN AND UGLY AND HAIRY THEY WERE. BUT GRACE DIDN'T SEE THEM THAT WAY. SHE KNEW THAT IF YOU ONLY LOOK AT WHAT SOMETHING LOOKS LIKE ON THE OUTSIDE, YOU CAN MISS THE TRUE BEAUTY ON THE INSIDE. I'M REALLY SORRY FOR NOT SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH GRACE'S EYES... THROUGH GOD'S EYES, I GUESS. I'M THE UGLY CATERPILLAR AND GRACE IS THE BUTTERFLY. AND I SURE HOPE THAT ONE DAY YOU CAN SEE THAT MY HEART IS DIFFERENT NOW. BECAUSE GRACE SHOWED ME WHAT TRUE FORGIVENESS LOOKS LIKE. WHAT TRUE FRIENDSHIP LOOKS LIKE. * [MUSIC] * [MUSIC] * [MUSIC] * [MUSIC] * [MUSIC] * [MUSIC] * [MUSIC] * [MUSIC] * [MUSIC] * [MUSIC] * [MUSIC] CAPTIONED/SUBTITLED BY: CAPTIONS AND SUBTITLE SERVICES * OH, OH, UH, UH, OH... * CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I'M NOT LIKE THE OTHERS * * MY SKINNY JEANS, DYED TOPS LIKE THE OTHERS * * LONG LEGS, FIRM ABS I DON'T HAVE IT * * CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I'M FAR FROM PERFECT * * BLOND HAIR, DARK SKIN, THAT'S NOT ME * * FIVE FOOT AND FRECKLES ALL AROUND ME * * NOT FIT FOR A PLACE LIKE THIS * * CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I'M FAR FROM PERFECT * * MY LIFE MAY NOT BE GLAMOROUS * * IT'S OKAY TO BE SO FAR FROM PERFECT * * I'M NOT ANOTHER BARBIE DOLL MADE TO BE PLAYED WITH * * I WON'T BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL YOU'VE EVER SEEN * * THE GIRL ON THE COVER OF A MAGAZINE * * OH NO, I'M SO FAR FROM PERFECT * * OH, OH, UH, UH, OH... * DON'T YOU KNOW WHO I AM I GUESS YOU CAN'T TELL * * I'M NOT THE MOST PRETTY OR POPULAR * * DESIGNER BAGS AND HEELS, I DON'T WEAR THEM * * CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I'M FAR FROM PERFECT * * BRAND NAMES THOSE THINGS NEVER FIT ME * * DIAMOND RINGS ON MY HANDS YOU'LL NEVER SEE * * NOT FIT FOR A PLACE LIKE THIS * * CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I'M FAR FROM PERFECT * * MY LIFE MAY NOT BE FABULOUS * * IT'S OKAY TO BE SO FAR FROM PERFECT * * I'M NOT ANOTHER BARBIE DOLL MADE TO BE PLAYED WITH * * I WON'T BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL YOU'VE EVER SEEN * * THE GIRL ON THE COVER OF A MAGAZINE * * OH NO, I'M SO FAR FROM PERFECT * * [MUSIC] * AND I'M OKAY WITH BEING ME * * THIS HEART IS NOT A PERFECT STORY * * YES I'M OKAY WITH BEING ME * * THIS HEART IS NOT A PERFECT STORY * * I'M SO FAR [SO FAR, SO FAR] TELL ME HOW FAR YOU ARE * * YEAH I'M SO FAR [SO FAR] TELL ME HOW FAR YOU ARE * * 'CAUSE I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW YES I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW * * IT'S OKAY TO BE SO FAR [SO FAR] FROM PERFECT * * I'M NOT ANOTHER BARBIE DOLL MADE TO BE * * I WON'T BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL YOU'VE EVER SEEN * * THE GIRL ON THE COVER OF A MAGAZINE, OH, NO... * * I'M SO...YEAH, SO FAR [SO FAR] FROM PERFECT [FROM PERFECT] * * I'M NOT ANOTHER BARBIE DOLL MADE TO BE PLAYED WITH * * I WON'T BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL YOU'VE EVER SEEN * * NOT THE GIRL ON THE COVER OF A MAGAZINE * * OH NO, I'M SO FAR FROM PERFECT * * OH, OH, UH, UH, OH... *
