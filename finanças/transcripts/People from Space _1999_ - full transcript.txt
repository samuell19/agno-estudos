-I used to be an exotic dancer. And Bob was a regular at this club I worked at. It was a really difficult time in my life. And I guess I was feeling a little empty. [MUSIC - PATSY CLINE, "HEARTACHES"] BOB: Felicia, where is Sean? It's already 9:25. He said he was going to be here at 9 o'clock. I don't understand this guy. -Honey, you need to relax, OK? BOB: I am relaxed. -No, you're not. We said last night that we were just going to have a nice time. And you said that you were going to work on trying to relax. OK? -I mean, remember last year? I don't know if you remember last year-- exactly a year ago-- he was supposed to come over and we were supposed to go trick-or-treating together. And he never showed up. -Remember he had a problem with his costume? You know what his limitations are. And we said last night that we were just going to enjoy the day, OK? BOB: Ok. Are the dishes all done? -I'm doing the dishes, OK? -All right. -We're going to have a nice day off. -I don't know where he is. It's already 9:25. He was supposed to be here at 9:15. FELICIA: Maybe they slept late. Maybe they had a little bit of traffic. -That's Sean. He's such a fucking idiot sometimes. He's a great guy. But, I mean, I tell him to be here at 9 o'clock. And he's not here at 9 o'clock. FELICIA: We don't have an agenda today. We're just going to relax. You can't control other people. So you need to just calm down and relax. And I'm sure maybe they just slept late. You know, they have the day off. Who knows? -I gotta relax. Maybe I'll have something to drink. -I know you had a stressful week-- -I had a very stressful week. You know how many insurance policies I sold this week? Zero. Zero. Goose egg. FELICIA: Well, but you tried very hard and next week will be better. So today-- -Oh, there's nothing to eat. -We just had a huge breakfast, honey. What else- what do you want to eat? -I want some-- I don't know.Like, a big egg. I want a gigantic bowl of eggs or something. -You're not hungry. You know, you're not hungry. You already had a big breakfast. -OK. Well-- -Why don't you just-- I tell you what to do. -What? -Why don't you look in the paper and maybe see if there's some ideas that we might have a nice weekend with these people. -I don't see anything in here. There's just-- look, we can go to a garden. Go to a garden. Visit the garden. There's nothing but gardens in here. -OK. [DOORBELL] -Hi. -Hi. -How you doing? -How you doing? -You finally made it, you too. -Yeah. -Hey man, what's going on? -Hey, um I need some aspirin. BOB: How you doing? Thanks for coming. -I have a wicked headache. Thanks for coming. -I have a wicked headache. -I have a wicked headache. SEAN: Good, good. -I have a wicked headache. SEAN: Good, good. BOB: Uh, Felicia has some aspirin. -Really? OK. BOB: Yeah. She's in the kitchen. Felicia, Missy needs some aspirin. Could you give her some aspirin? I think we have some Bayer. OK? Hey, man, what's happening? -Things are good. Things are good. BOB: Oh, really? -Great morning. BOB: Did-- did you do any surfing this morning? -Oh, yeah. dawn patrol. Man, it was beautiful. Waist-high. Totally clean. BOB: We've been talking about doing some of that surfing together-- -Oh, you should go. We should-- BOB: You never call me. But you never call me, Sean. You told me about five times that we were going to to surfing and we never have. -We'll do it. BOB: But anyway, we'll do it, right? -We'll do it. BOB: Right? We're going to go surfing. Again, this weekend, let's just sit around and watch the baseball game or something. OK? -Sounds great. Sounds great. BOB: OK. Why don't you come on in. And, uh, we'll just sit down in the living room and let's just chat. Because I haven't seen you in about three weeks. We can sit on the couch. So can I get you something to drink? Like OJ or water or something like that? What do you like? -Oh, you know, Bob, if you had a beer, that would be fantastic. -Beer? Uh, I don't know if I have any beer. It's kind of early. What is that? Like surfer-- what surfers do? Beer? Let me-- let me see if I have anything, OK? Let me see. What kind of beer do you like? SEAN: What do got? -Uh, I got, uh, Schlitz-- SEAN: Schlitz. -And Budweiser. -Schlitz. BOB: Schlitz? Oh, wait a minute. No, I thought I had some Schlitz. -Schlitz? You still drink that? BOB: No. How about a Bud? -They're good. -Why can't you switch to some good beer or something? BOB: Is a Budweiser OK? SEAN: Whatever, Bob. -OK. All right. MISSY: Asprin. Yes. Thank God. -I don't drink myself. In the morning. FELICIA: You wanted two, right? MISSY: Yes, I want-- I want two. -There you go. MISSY: Yes, I want-- I want two. -There you go. SEAN: Cool, thanks. SEAN: Cool, thanks. -There are huge aspirin. My god. BOB: I think it's a twist off. -What are these horse pills or something? My god. BOB: Let's talk about what we're going to do today. Because we don't have too much time. I think we should get-- you know, it's kind of late. Let's discuss what we're going to do. And I make a list of things that I thought we could do. FELICIA: You, you, you made a list? BOB: I made a a list. FELICIA: He likes to make lists. BOB: And I like to make lists because I'm an organized person. Here's a list of things that I thought we could do. One, bird watching. We could go bird watching. -We've already that. Um-- -OK. MISSY: If there's time to do that. -Yeah. Oh, that's right. We don't have any time to do that because you were late. So we can't do. So forget that. We could go apple picking. What do you think about that, Felicia? -That would be nice. BOB: Do we have time to do that? -I could do that. Yeah. -Oh, honey. Could you-- no, I'm allergic to smoke. Could you do that outside? Just go outside. I'm sorry. Yeah. BOB: OK. Apple picking. Do you like apple picking, Sean? MISSY: You liked it the last time we went. Or were you lying? You were lying. BOB: OK. We could also go to the museum. They have a new collection. MISSY: Of what? -Of Edward Munch. FELICIA: Oh a museum would be-- -Of Edward Munch. FELICIA: Oh a museum would be-- FELICIA: Oh a museum would be-- MISSY: Oh, well. FELICIA: Oh a museum would be-- MISSY: Oh, well. -Yeah. You want to go see him? He's a little depressing. But, but that's the-- -It's kind of nice outside today, though. I want to be outside. -The final idea I had was baseball game. Minor league baseball game. Do you want to do that? BOB: OK. Well-- -Sometimes I don't like baseball. Sometimes I do. You know what I mean? BOB: OK. We're not going to do bird watching. We're not going to do apple picking. We're not going to do the museum or the baseball game. So what do you want to do? -Camping. BOB: Camping? -Do you want to? BOB: Yeah. We could do camping. That's a good idea. We're going camping. MISSY: We could make a camp fire. -Camping. MISSY: I love camp fires. Come on, let's do it. Let's do it. -Wait a minute. Sean, I just got an idea. That's a great idea. You know why? Because two years ago, a UFO was supposed to have crash landed up at Beaver Tail Lake. Did you read that? MISSY: I heard about that. I totally heard about that. -I'm not kidding. SEAN: A UFO? -And there's $100,000 reward. -A $100,00? BOB: So we would not only find the alien UFO, we would get $100,000. MISSY: Oh, that would be the best. BOB: So I think we should go. Do you have any camping equipment? SEAN: Sure. MISSY: I think so. -OK. Go home and get your camping equipment. And then we have that camping equipment left over, right? FELICIA: Yeah. I'm not a great camper, honey. BOB: Well, we have something to go-- FELICIA: But a $100,000 would, you know-- -Yeah. OK. Go home, get your camping equipment, meet us back here in two hours, OK? MISSY: Two hours? FELICIA: We could probably do that in an hour. -OK. Come in an hour. Let's do that. You're going to come back in an hour. SEAN: Easy, easy. -OK. Come back in an hour. And let's go camping. -Listen you guys, seriously. This UFO took these people away. Wake up. -Wait, I heard about that. MISSY: Yeah. And then when they came back and they didn't have any leg. -How could they return if they had no legs? SEAN: Dude, airlift them out. MISSY: Yeah. -But, did they find the legs when they went back or? -I think they grew back. They grew back. -I think they grew back. They grew back. They grew back. BOB: OK. They grew back. BOB: OK. Why don't you guys-- -No. No. BOB: Go home. Get your stuff. Come back in an hour. And we'll go up to Beaver Tail Lake, OK? Agreed? -All right. BOB: We're going to do that? FELICIA: Oh, OK. BOB: Is it OK? FELICIA: Yeah, let's go. -Ok. Let's go. -All right. BOB: All right. Come on. Let's g. MISSY: See ya. BOB: OK. We'll see you later, you love birds. And hurry up, we're under a real time constraint. -Yeah. I'm just going to stop at the GAP really, really fast. BOB: No, don't-- -There's a tank top sale. I have to go. BOB: No. Don't stop anywhere. Missy, please don't stop anywhere. We don't have any time. OK? And make sure you come back. Please come back. -Felicia-- -What? -We're going to go to Beaver Tail Lake to look for a UFO. [MUSIC PLAYING] BOB: Hey, I think when we get down to Beaver Tail Lake, if we all remain calm we'll be able to do what we have to do. You know what I mean? FELICIA: Did you get-- did you bring the bug spray? -No, I didn't. I-- you were supposed to bring it. -I need bug spray. FELICIA: OK. Because like I have-- SEAN: No bugs-- bugs don't like me. They don't-- -Lyme Disease. You can get, uh, horrible Lyme Disease. MISSY: Oh, no, no. That's ticks. SEAN: I never get bit. I never get bit. MISSY: Mosquitos you can get-- you can get encephalitis. FELICIA: Oh, what are you-- um, could you not do that in here? I'm really-- I'm, I'm allergic to cigarettes. BOB: Sean. FELICIA: Any kind of smoke. BOB: Sean, Felicia is allergic to cigarette smoke. Could you not do that in here? -We'll be in the woods really soon. -It's cool. It's cool. FELICIA: Thanks. So, Sean, how's the uh, video business going? -Oh, it's cool. It's cool. Yeah, it's mellow. FELICIA: Great. -I mean. -He's going to get a raise next month. Right, honey? -Oh, totally. Yeah. Yeah. BOB: What's the biggest seller right now video-was, Sean? Is it Clint Eastwood still? -No, no, no, no, no. He was-- FELICIA: That was a long time ago. -Yeah, that was like five year ago. -Clint's a general good-- good sell. But right now I think it's, um, I'm tyring to think what's-- -The Titanic. -Titanic is still up there. I mean, Jesus. -That's a killer movie, man. -It's sad. FELICIA: So do you have, like X rated movies, too? In there? SEAN: Oh--oh, yeah. FELICIA: Oh, you do? Is it, like, a special department? MISSY: He doesn't watch any of those. Sean doesn't watch those. FELICIA: Yeah, but you've-- -Anybody have any idea what an alien might look like? FELICIA: Yeah, like the ET guy. -What? FELICIA: You know, like in ET. -No, I don't think he looks anything like that. MISSY: I think they have big heads. SEAN: You're still on this alien thing, man. There just aren't any. FELICIA: I think that, um-- -I read in an article one time, in Scientific American, they look like-- probably look like a gigantic computer or like a university professor. -Do you think they have pets? The aliens? Do you think they have pets? Like, do they have dogs and cats? SEAN: They eat their pets. FELICIA: You know, I think of them-- No, I think-- I think that they're really friendly. I mean, I think that they're just like us. -OK. My idea is this. We'll get to the lake. We'll park the car. We'll start hiking a couple of miles. And, uh, I think it will take us to the middle of the day. Then we'll stop, we'll have lunch, and then we'll walk some more. And, uh, then we'll probably camp out-- uh, camp for the night. How does that sound like? Does that sound good to everybody? -Sound like a hoot. BOB: Missy, do you think that you can do that? -Sure. I didn't hear what you said. But that's fine. BOB: If we all do our-- what we're supposed to be doing, we'll be OK. All right? All right, Felicia? FELICIA: Well, do we all have, like, a certain job in this? What do you mean, doing what we're supposed to do? -I mean, you know, just don't tell me halfway there that you're tired. You know? FELICIA: OK. Well, hopefully I won't be tire. -I mean, you have a tendency-- in the past, you did that a couple of times. Remember we drove up to New Hampshire-- FELICIA: I just got tired. BOB: You got tired, like, at ten miles out of the-- away from the town. FELICIA: I think it was more than ten miles. -Ten miles away from home you got tired. FELICIA: Well, you know, it takes a lot of energy to keep you calm all day. [RADIO ADVERTISEMENTS] BOB: OK, everybody. Let's sing a song, OK? I'm going to start it, all right? Kumbaya, my Lord, kumbaya. Come on, everybody. EVERYBODY: Kumbaya, my Lord, kumbaya. FELICIA: Come on, Sean. EVERYBODY: Kumbaya, my Lord, kumbaya. Oh, my Lord, kumbaya. BOB: OK. Here's one. FELICIA: What the next verse? BOB: They'll be coming round the mountain when she comes. EVERYBODY: She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes. She'll be coming round the mountain-- FELICIA: What about the one? 100 bottles of beer on the wall. 100 bottles of beer? -I'm guessing that there haven't been any other people looking for the UFO. I mean, I haven't heard any announcement that the $100,000 was awarded yet to anyone. So I have to assume that a, nobody has found the UFO yet. And b, uh, we're one of the few people who are looking for it. So let's just go on that assumption. FELICIA: OK. SEAN: UFO fever probably died down a year and a half ago. [MUSIC PLAYING] BOB: Excuse me, do you know how to get to Beaver Tail Lake, sir? We're kind of lost. -Why the fuck do you want to go to Beaver Tail Lake? -Well, I want to go hiking up there. Do you know where that is? It's down this road, I believe. -I don't stand around in the asshole of nowhere for nothing. Um, change maybe? -Here, honey, we have money here. Here. Give him as much money as we have. Be nice to him. -OK. How's that? -I guess it'll have to do. BOB: We were told it's that way. Is there where we can go? -Um, are we talking about the front end of your car or the back end of your car? BOB: Both ends. The whole car and my three passengers. -Well, no. This way and that way. This way the front end of your car? Is that way the back end of your car? How do I know? -Listen, let me try to start this over again. OK. We just want to go the fuck to Beaver Tail Lake. Do you know how to do that? -Oh, fucking mother of god. Have pity on the blind. I mean, come on. Come on. BOB: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. -Come on. BOB: Yeah, well, that's all we have right now so can you tell me know how to get to Beaver Tail Lake? -You think that I could do something like this? -Do something like what? -Give directions on the road. -Oh, I don't it's a job. I mean, I think you have to be blind. -Somewhere on the lake. -No, no. It does matter. Because on the east side-- uh, who are you people? BOB: Well, that doesn't matter. Listen-- -Well, no, no, it does. Because some people come for the rock concert and some people come for the Big Foot thing and some people come for the lizard in the lake. And then there's some people that come for uh, the north side. You know the north side? -All right. All right. I get it. Listen, here. Here's some more money. Let me try one more time. -One more time's OK. BOB: How's that? -All right. All right. Well, you know, it's thin but it's a little bit better. Now look, on the north side and the west side-- SEAN: Just give him some weed. FELICIA: Give him some-- SEAN: Just give him some weed. FELICIA: Give him some-- FELICIA: Give him some-- MISSY: All right. FELICIA: Give him some-- MISSY: All right. Yeah. FELICIA: I don't know. Do you think he wants? SEAN: Share. -Just give it to him. -No, I don't think I should do that. MISSY: Why not? What else is he going to do out here? -I don't want to encourage people to be doing drugs. I don't think that's the right thing. MISSY: This is a natural herb. -OK, listen. I gotta go. OK? I'm going to go now. OK? So, so-- -But you don't know where you're going. BOB: It doesn't matter. We'll find it. -You don't know where you're going. No, it does matter. BOB: We'll just see you later. -It does matter. BOB: All right? All right? See you later. -I don't give a rat's ass what you do. I don't give a rat's ass. -All right. Beaver Tail Lake. This is not what I remember it to be like. But I don't know. -Will you pop the trunk? -OK. get your stuff. What have you got in there? A bed? Missy? This backpack is huge. -It's not that big, is it? -This is the map. And we're going to be-- going from Beaver Tail Pond to Beaver Tail Lake. And if we find the pond, we should be able to find the lake. OK, ladies. FELICIA: OK. -Gather round. I want to show you what we're going to be doing today. MISSY: Yep. -Listen very closely because it's real important. This forest goes on for about 15 miles. -OK. -In all four directions. I don't know what's back there. I've never been there. So let's just assume we don't know what's back there. It could be anything. Sean? Can you listen for a second, Sean? Please? Thanks a lot. And, uh, but this is the map. OK? -OK. -We're going to be starting essentially-- we're going to walk down here about two miles-- maybe 2 and 1/2 miles-- to Beaver Tail Pond. OK? -Isn't that, um-- that's Beaver Tail River. Just so you know. -No. It's not a river, Missy. It says Beaver Tail Pond. -No, it's-- actually, it's a river. But that's OK. -This is a river-- no, this is a river over here. -She might have been here. She might know it's a river. -OK. OK. -I came here a long time ago so-- -All right. But I think this is-- this is the river over here. And this is the pond over here. So we're going to go to Beaver Tail Pond down here. About 2 and 1/2 miles. Sean, can-- can you look at the-- come over here. And then we've got to find from that-- that-- from there we go to Beaver Tail Lake, which is supposedly where the UFO is. -So there's a pond, there's a river, and a lake and they're all name tail? -No. There's no river. There is a river. But we don't have to find the river. -OK. -Ok. What I want you to understand is this map is very important. We cannot lose this map. Because if we're out there 2 and 1/2 miles, 3 miles, and we get lost and we lose the map we're basically essentially fucked. So-- FELICIA: Do you want me to hold the map? BOB: Yeah, you hold it. You hold it. I want you to hold it. MISSY: I can hold it. BOB: No. -I think maybe I should hold it. -No. Let her hold it. She's OK, Missy. So you hold it. Because you've held maps before, right? MISSY: Her's doesn't have a zipper and mine does. -OK. If we're all cool-- MISSY: All right. FELICIA: We're relaxed. -I'm relaxed. FELICIA: OK. BOB: OK, MISSY: We're relaxed. SEAN: Bob, chill. I got the bread crumbs. -All right. I'm chilled. OK. I'm chilled, Sean. Don't worry about it. All right. Let's go. FELICIA: All right. BOB: OK. And, uh, watch for snakes. Ah, just kidding there's not snakes. SEAN: Boo. FELICIA: Oh, come on, Sean. SEAN: Spooky. FELICIA: Does anyone know what to do if attacked by a wild bear? SEAN: Act taller than the bear. FELICIA: No. you're supposed to-- SEAN: Act taller than the bear. MISSY: What happens if we have to go to the bathroom again? SEAN: Sorry, Missy. FELICIA: Yeah, be careful. SEAN: Ah, the crossroads. BOB: All right. FELICIA: Now what? BOB: It's a trail. FELICIA: OK, um, we should-- SEAN: Miss? BOB: Missy? FELICIA: Missy? -I thought I saw a rabbit. BOB: No. You didn't see anything. Just please stay around here because we got to stick together. OK? -She'll be all right. She'll be all right. -Can I have the map? -Uh, do I have it? -Yeah, you have the map. -I have the map. -All right. I have to look at the map. -The precious map. -See where we are. The map. OK. -I'm still getting bitten for some reason. -What do you see, Miss? -I want to-- OK. FELICIA: Come on, guys. We have to stay together. BOB: OK. It looks like we've gone about 200 feet. But I don't know where we are. I can't find where this trail is. FELICIA: Well, it looks to me like we should go south. -No. I think we're lost already and we've only been hiking for about two minutes. -Relax. You always do this. -We go west first. And then we can loop around. FELICIA: I think we need to go south. BOB: No. No. We came from the west. Now we have to go north. Sean, what do you think? FELICIA: No. Don't ask him. -We came from here, the car. Now we have to go north. -I think we should go south. -No, no, no. It's so much easier to go west. -I think you're reading it backwards. -I think we have to go north. Because we were right here. -Because then you have to skip over everything. -Now the pond is-- -You're reading it upside down, do you know that? -No. You're right. It is upside down. I'm sorry. -They're totally lost. -My hunch is that we have to go-- we're right here. What are you saying? -South. -OK. We have to go south. MISSY: What are we doing? BOB: I don't know which way to go. OK. Uh, uh, I think what we want to do is-- -Go south? MISSY: Go west. -Eenie, meenie, miney,mo. SEAN: That's a good method. BOB: Well, Sean. Do you have a better method? I mean, you know, you were-- you were in the Marines, weren't you? What were you in the to Cub Scouts. How does a Cub Scout become a Boy Scout? You know? He eats a brownie. OK. Listen, I think what we're going to do is I'm going to have to make a decision here. OK? And I think what we're going to do is-- let me read the map some more. I don't know whether it's that way or that way. MISSY: Can I see the map? BOB: No, I'm reading the map. Don't worry I know how to read the map. Sean, come here. I want to talk to you about this. OK. Ladies, we made a-- Sean and I have talked about it. We decided what we're going to do. FELICIA: Yes. -Sean and I have decided-- FELICIA: OK. -That we're going to go that way. OK? We're going to go that way. All right? Are we all agreed? FELICIA: OK. -OK. Let's go. Go ahead. You lead, Missy. But, Missy, please stay within the group, OK? Because, you know, there's bears. FELICIA: He's got her. Just-- would you relax? BOB: I'm relaxed. FELICIA: You're going to make crazy. BOB: I'm relaxed. I'm completely relaxed. I've never been more relaxed in my life. [MUSIC PLAYING] INTERVIEWER: You think that the money is more important than the-- -No, the money means nothing to me. I really-- the $100,000 just is not that important. I mean, I mean, I think I should get all the money because-- me and Felicia-- because it was all of our idea. INTERVIEWER: You're not afraid of getting abducted yourself? BOB: No. I've never worried about getting abducted by aliens or UFOs or even humans. I just-- I don't think that anybody would want to abduct me. There's nothing really, like, abduct-able about me at all. INTERVIEWER: Do you really believe in UFOs? -Yeah. I really-- I think there are UFOs. I think there are aliens from another civilization. If I didn't, I probably wouldn't have come out here today. FELICIA: OK. I really need a rest. MISSY: Want to stop here? FELICIA: This looks like a good spot. BOB: All right. Let's rest here, OK? FELICIA: All right. -I think we're going to find a UFO. I think we're going to find the alien. But, uh, quite frankly I don't know how Felicia and Missy and Sean are going to hold up. But, uh, we'll have to see what happens this weekend. BOB: Hello? MISSY: Hey, um, what would you guys do with the money? BOB: Hello out there? SEAN: New TV. BOB: Hello? Hello? Is anybody out there? Is anybody-- MISSY: I would give it all to charity. -Is anybody out there now? Is anybody out there now? Is anybody out there? MISSY: Can you remind me again why we're doing this? BOB: We're looking for a UFO. MISSY: Is there a reason behind this? BOB: If you know where one is, please tell us. MISSY: If anyone I know comes out here, I'm so embarrassed. -Sean, do you realize if we find this UFO-- do you have any conception that if we find it, well make $100,000. Do you realize what that mean? You can quit that job. That stupid fucking job at the video store. -More importantly, Bob-- -I can quit the job at the insurance office. We'll be rich. -How we see life as we know it will change, Bob. You don't really think there's a UFO? Do you? BOB: I think there really is a UFO. There really is a UFO. I'm in it for the whole way. I mean, I'm going to do the best I can to find the UFO. By hook or by crook. Because we're looking at $100,000 if we find it. Apart from that, Sean's being kind of a dick. But it's going OK. Look at this fucking thing. SEAN: What? -What the hell is this? -What? -Over-- look at this. FELICIA: What's going on now? -It's some sort of, uh, totem. MISSY: What's happening? What is that? SEAN: It's made out of thumb tacks. BOB: You know what this is? FELICIA: Be careful what you're touching. MISSY: What is that? FELICIA: What is that? MISSY: This is freaking me out, you guys. FELICIA: He looks kind of frightened. -All right. Let's keep going. FELICIA: I think someone's trying to tell us something. BOB: I don't want to hang around here for too long. FELICIA: I don't know. I'm getting a little worried. BOB: Let's keep going. FELICIA: Are you sure? OK. MISSY: Why are we-- FELICIA: Le'ts all stay together. INTERVIEWER: How are things going so far? -We're all here for one purpose. To find the UFO, you know? And when I get back with all the money, I'm going to make my own animal league. For animals. Like dogs and cats and hamsters and things like that. Because that's really what is important to me. Is taken care of animals like hamsters and gerbils. INTERVIEWER: Do you believe in UFOs? -I do. Uh-huh. And I really think that, if UFOs come down here, that they probably have pets that need to be taken care of, too. That I can help with their pets. In the UFOs. So that's really what I want to do. So If I could just help them with their pets that would be really good. INTERVIEWER: You're not afraid of being abducted or anything? -No. That would be a very good experience, I think. For anybody to go and see some different life forms. I'm very interested in different life forms. -Hey. Hold up. Hold up. -What? -Check it out. -What? -Check it out. BOB: I don't see anything. What? What are you talking about? SEAN: No. That flash. FELICIA: What's the problem? MISSY: What? BOB: That light? MISSY: What did we stop for? -Yeah. There's a pattern to it. -Yeah. There's a pattern to it. There's a pattern to it. MISSY: What? There's a pattern to it. MISSY: What? FELICIA: What light? -Hey, Miss. MISSY: What? -Grab the pen out of my pocket. BOB: Be careful. Be quiet. OK. Sean, are you talking about the thing going on-- -Wait, wait. U, Y, O, A-- BOB: What? do you know Morse Code or something? -Yeah, my dad taught me as a kid. BOB: Well, what does it say? -A, S, S-- asshole? BOB: What? -You are an asshole. That's what it says. -Sean, will you cut-- stop the bullshit. -I'm telling you No. I'm not shitting you. -It says-- are you trying to tell me it says, you're an asshole? -That's the pattern. -You're an asshole. -That's the pattern. MISSY: Honey, are you sure? -All right. -I'm telling you. That's what it says. -All right. Well, let's go check it out and see what it is. Just be careful of the poison ivy, OK? Do you still see that light, Sean? SEAN: No. It keeps repeating. BOB: What does it-- Does it still say you're an asshole. SEAN: Yeah. FELICIA: Bob, what's happening? BOB: I don't know what's happening. We're just going to go toward that light, OK? -Honey, come on. I don't want to lose you. SEAN: I'm tell you, man. SEAN: Bob, what the hell is that? -I don't know. What the fuck is this? Maybe you shouldn't look at this at all. OK? Don't look at this. This is obviously a signal of some kind to tell us that we're near the UFO. -This is just starting to get a little-- -I feel like I'm going to throw up. BOB: You want this? -Come on. [WOLF HOWLING] -So do you think this is a good idea coming out here? -I think this was a great idea. -You really did? -Yeah. I mean, you know, you do this all the time. You make a decision, you want to do something, and then you second guess yourself. -What the hell are we doing here? -I don't know. I was just going to ask you that. What's up with Bob? -I know. I mean, Felicia's OK. But Bob is starting to freak me out a little bit. -I am worried about Sean and Missy, quite frankly. -Well, why don't you just relax a little bit. They're grownups. -I mean, are they going to be able to it? Missy already seems like she's cracking up or something under the strain. -The guy is just going off. -He's, like, really into this UFO thing. You know, I mean-- -In a way that isn't right. -No. He's not right. -I think she's ready for an insane asylum. -Well, she's-- -I don't think she really has a brain. You know? -Well, she's not, you know, the brightest light bulb in the world. But it's-- -I don't even think she's a light bulb. I think she's like a candle. -Yeah. It's, it's, it's really-- it's, it's making me in a way that I haven't been. I mean, it's, it's, it's weird. -It's wicked weird. -So you really think there is a UFO out there? -I'm convinced? -In Beaver Tail Lake? -Yes. -You think there's a UFO? -Yes. I feel really-- I have a good feeling about it. -I've been really nervous latley. I don't know I feel like-- I mean, don't get me wrong, I feel like I'm sort of holding us both up here. You know? I mean, I've-- -How? -I've got this killer job at the video store. -Well, you do have a killer job. -And I'm making some sweet money. -It's big time money. -But I fell like I'm the only one doing it. -And you're telling me this because? -I mean, I fell like you ought to get a job. -A job? -What to know what I think? -What -You really want to know what I think? -I hope it's going to make me happy. -I think Missy and Sean are going to try to get the UFO without us. -Oh, no. I don't think so. -And then they'll keep all the money without us. -You always do this. -I need some help here. I can't be the only one buying dinner. -Did you hear that? -No. You're hearing things. -I think Sean's listening to us. You're hearing things. -I think Sean's listening to us. -I think Sean's listening to us. -No. -I think Sean's listening to us. -No. He's not listening to us. Relax. -Sean? Are you out there? All right. All right. All right. I'll relax. I promise. Let's out to the campfire tonight. We'll be really relaxed. OK? -OK. -Let's pretend we never had this conversation at all. -OK. -OK? -Good. -Great. -Great. -This is a great fire. -Are you having a good time, honey? Isn't this nice? -It's a great fire. You know, this is the type of fire-- -Who did this fire? Did I do this fire? -Th is is the type of fire-- No. This is the type of fire that they probably burnt Joan of Arc at the stake on. You know? -Oh, honey. Where do you come up with these things? BOB: What do you think it was like getting burnt at the stake? -Honey, please. You know? BOB: It must have been really disgusting. -You're a-- you're a sick dude, man. You know that? BOB: Yeah, but did you ever think what it might have been like getting burnt at the stake. -You know him. You know him. -Honey, don't even think those things. -Yeah, I know him. -Just stop it. BOB: This hurts just doing this. I can't imagine getting burnt at the stake. It must be hard. -What would you rather do: burn to death or freeze to death? If I was going to die. BOB: I'd like to-- I'd like to fry to death. You know? Like, put me in a big batter. -This is a horrible conversation. -Deep fry to death? BOB: Deep. Like a french fry. Then somebody would eat me. Now listen, today was a little difficult because it was the first day, all right? Tomorrow's going to be a lot better. I just know it. We're going to find what we need. The pond. We're going to find the pond. -River. -It's a pond, Missy. -Yeah, whatever. -Just by what you thought you saw on the map. All right? It's a pond. -Whatever. -And then we're going to find the river. And then we're going to find the lake. And then we're going to find the UFO in the lake. -Oh, yes. Right there. -Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I hear somebody-- I hear somebody having sex. -We are having sex. -Wait a minute. No, no, no. Somebody else. Wait. Listen. Do you hear that? Somebody else. -What? Who else is here? -Maybe it's Missy or Sean. -So? Why can't they have sex? -Maybe they're listening to us. I got to go check it out. I can't do it. I got to go check it out. -OK. Fine. -I got to check it out. I got to-- Missy? What's wrong? -Sean's gone again. -Well, where did he go? -I don't know. -How long ago did you see him? -Three or four hours ago. I don't know. -Hey, listen, I'm going to go look for him. You stay right here. Don't go anywhere, OK? I'll be right back. -Where else am I going to go? [WOLF HOWLING] BOB: Sean, where are you? -What? BOB: Sean? -I'm over here. BOB: Where are you? -Over here. -Where have you been? -Oh, sitting right here. -I've been looking all over for you for the last 1/2 hour. Missy said you took off on her. What's going on? Are you having an argument with her? -Yeah. A little bit. I sort of flipped out on and took off. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. -Well, what kind of argument did you have? What's the problem with you two? -I think I got upset with her. I've been-- I'm trying to get her to get a job. I don't know. I feel like I'm carrying all the weight and I'm not sure she's-- -Yeah. You think you're, like, busting your balls and she's home polishing her nails, right? -Right. -Don't let her take advantage of you, Sean. I've Told that a couple thousand time. You know. When Felicia takes advantage of me, I just want to clobber her. Well, you know, not literally clobber her. But I had to be after her for over a year and a half to get a job. You've got to tell her she's got to get out. You got to give her an ultimatum. Get out and do something. You know what I mean? She's just can't stay home all day. That's my advice to you. I won't say anything else after that, all right? Everything else OK? -Yeah. It's fine. -You sure everything else is OK? -Yeah. We're going great. -Nothing else is going on wrong? -Nah. It's great. -You can tell me. Because we've been friends now. You know? -We're fine. -You sure everything's OK? How is your sex life, for instance? -That's a little personal, Bob. -Well, I'm only asking that because you're going after that thing like, uh, you know, Mr. Woody for Christ's sake. So just tell me-- -No, everything's fine. -You sure everything's fine? -No. It's not fine. -What do you mean? -We haven't done it in about four months. -Oh, Christ. Four months. You want a word of advice? I'll give you a word of advice. -Sure. -Actually, four words. Teenage sex games. -Hey, how you doing? -What's up? -What's the problem? FELICIA: Oh, I don't know. He's out, you know, doing Bob things. -Bob things? What things are those? -You know what I'm talking about? -I have no idea. -Oh, listen to this. About three weeks ago, I was in this video store-- not the one you work at, but the other one, you know? Across town? Joe Blows? I was in there and I got this movie. And I brought it home. And I watched it. It was unbelievable. What this things is about is that these two guys are wandering around in the woods. You see, they're lost and everything. And they come across this camp that's a camp for girls. -You probably wonder what we're doing together. MISSY: Yeah, like, don't you want some excitement? -Yeah, I do. And, um, he's so dorky. -He's dorky. But, I mean, he's money. FELICIA: I need something more. Do you ever have fantasies? MISSY: Fantasies? -Every single girl in this camp is fucking unbelievable. You know, like, gigantic tits. -Ooh, no way. -Yeah, and these girls they adopt these two guys. -Everyone has fantasies. -You have? Tell me one. -All right. One of them's that I'm in the woods. And, um, I meet this really, really hot guy. And he has like a really, really hot friend. And we just do it right there in the woods. Like, all night long. -Really? Does he have, like, like, a really big penis? -Oh, We just have sex all night in the trees. -You and the two? I like that fantasy. -These guys go nuts for these girls over the next three or four weeks. And they're just fucking their brains out. And it's unbelievable. -I want to be spanked. MISSY: OK. Oh, my god. -Tell me about Sean. What's he like? Big penis? MISSY: Well, yeah. He has a big penis. But he smokes so much dope. He smokes too much. He needs to do something about that. Have you ever been with a woman? -No. I've thought about it though. -Did you? -Well. -I mean, if I-- if I ever, you know, if I ever would or thought about it, I think-- I think she would be blond. -You know, they went to heaven and dies. You know what I mean? It's just unbelievable. So my advice to you is get Teenage Sex Camp as soon as possible. And you won't regret it, OK? And I think, uh, hey, quite frankly, Missy won't regret it either. You know what I mean? OK? You know what I mean? -Bob, you know, I didn't realize you were this much of a perver, dude. -I'm not a purve. It's this-- everybody knows this. MISSY: What if they come back? You nervous? -I don't know. Just-- I don't know. It's just like I'm-- it would be like an experiment, you know? Like-- MISSY: But we'd never tell them we would do that. [MUSIC - PATSY CLINE, "STRANGE"] -Hey, Miss? Check this out. Miss? [SCREAM] SEAN: Miss? BOB: Missy? You OK? TWIG MAN: She's fine. She's passed out. BOB: What the hell happened? TWIG MAN: She fainted. -She fainted? TWIG MAN: I startled her. Sorry about that. She'll be all right. BOB: Who are you? -I'm Twiggy. BOB: Twig man? -I live here. BOB: What's that thing? TWIG MAN: That's my concertina. BOB: What you do with that? TWIG MAN: I play it. Here, you want a little music? BOB: Sure. TWIG MAN: Music would help calm her down. As I wandered out on the dockside so fair. To view the still water and take the salt air. I spied an old fisherman singing this song. Singing, take me away, boys. Me time is not long. Wrap me up in the oyster net. No more on the docks I'll be seen. Just tell me old shipmates I'm taking a trip, mates. I'll see you one day. BOB: Excellent. FELICIA: Thank you. Thank you. -Can you tell us something? We're looking for Beaver Tail Lake. Do you know where Beaver Tail Lake is? -Six miles north. FELICIA: Uh-huh. BOB: Yeah. -All right. You'll come to a stone wall. On the other side of the stone wall, you'll find the trail. Dead Man's Trail. At that point, you go west 1/2 mile. Then follow the trail east 1/2 mile. Six paces north-northeast. A step. And then two paces south-southwest. FELICIA: Two south. -Look over your left shoulder, and you'll see Beaver Tail Lake. BOB: Ok. So that's what we do. All right. So we got to find the lake. That's just what I thought. Thank you very much, man. -Bye-bye. -Bye. FELICIA: Be careful. Have a nice day. BOB: Be careful. Hold on. Hold on. Stop right here. I think we're lost. -What? We're fucking lost? FELICIA: Come on, Bob. Are you serious? -Where the fuck are we anyways? BOB: Don't worry about it. We'll be OK. -Who is going to feed my my cat? OK? Who? -Let's just calm down. -OK. Just relax. OK? Sometimes he exaggerates. We're not-- like, how lost are we? -Shut up. OK. Listen, OK. -I'm not saying anything, you big dick. BOB: Where's the-- where's the map I gave you? Do you have the map? FELICIA: How lost are we? What do you mean we're lost? -We're not that lost. Don't worry about it. -I know sometimes you exaggerate. -We're not-- we're a little bit lost. I have a general idea of where we are. OK? Where is the map I gave you? Do you have the map? -Missy, you wanted to see the map, remember? -Missy, do you have the map? I need the map. Do you have the map? -You asked-- you wanted to see the map. -Where is the map? -It's right back here. BOB: I don't see the map. I don't see the map. I just see something else here. But it's not the map. FELICIA: Oh, come on. Missy. -This isn't the map. This is-- this is a map of Buffalo, New York. This is totally useless. -It's not going work. -We cannot use that. We need a map. Do you have a road map of anything even near here? -No. BOB: I would take that. Do you have anything? -No. I don't have anything. Jesus. -OK. Stop yelling at her. Because it's not going to help things. -All right. All right. We need a map. So what I'm going to do is find some paper. And I'm going to draw another map here. We came in here. We saw Twig Man. He said-- FELICIA: Go six miles. -Six miles that way. If we find Beaver Tail Pond, which I believe is that way, we can get to Beaver Tail Lake, which is beyond that. And then we will find the alien spaceship. I'm going to. I'll see you later. If you want to go with me, I'm going to keep going. But if you want to stay here, that's fine. MISSY: Oh, you just want to leave us here now. That's cool. -So I'll see you later. -You want to leave us here? -No, if you want to come with me, you can. But I'm going. See you. -OK. Well, I feel responsible for them. You know, we brought them out here. BOB: If you want to come with me, that's OK. Come on. -We should go. I mean, I need to go with him. You guys-- I need to go with him. I mean, he's my husband. It'll be OK. It'll be all right. Sean's going. I mean, you need to go. -I like your lipstick. -You like this lipstick color? -Yeah. INTERVIEWER: So, Sean, how's this adventure going so far? -It's all right. I don't know. I mean, what do you mean? I mean, we're in the fucking woods. I mean, that's cool. INTERVIEWER: Getting along with everybody? -For the most part. I don't know. I mean, yeah. Felicia's great. Missy's cool. Bob's freaking me a little bit. I mean, he's-- he's really fucking controlling. And I don't know quite-- I don't know. I'm having a little bit of a hard time with it. I don't know. It's-- INTERVIEWER: Do you believe in abductions? -I don't know. I believe maybe people think that they've been abducted. I mean, the world is pretty much what you want. I mean, you build your own little thing. And you live in it. And, you know, if that happens in your little box, then that's what you do. INTERVIEWER: You wouldn't want to, uh, go up in a spaceship with Missy? -I mean, if there were such a thing, it might be cool. I mean, I got nothing really going on here. My job's all right. You know, I get to watch a lot of shit. But, I mean-- Yeah, no. That's be cool. I mean, if they were nice. I mean, I don't want them poking my eyeballs out with some fucking probe. -You guys here that? FELICIA: What? -I don't know. There's weird buzzing sound. FELICIA: Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. SEAN: Oh. FELICIA: Oh. -I just came. SEAN: I totally sprayed my shorts. -Could someone please tell me what's going on? BOB: That what intense. FELICIA: I just had an orgasm. You'll have one. -What? BOB: I just had an orgasm. -You all just had an orgasm? BOB: You'll have an organism, Missy. Don't worry about it. When we see the aliens, when we find them, you'll have one. SEAN: Baby, don't go away mad. -Something's happening to me out in the woods here. I don't know what it is. But I'm just-- I think it's the aliens. You know, I think that they're really here. Because I'm feeling just warm and tingly and things are just happening to my body. I just haven't felt these things with Bob. I think that we're going to find the aliens. And I think that there's an alien out there for me. And I think he's waiting for me in the spaceship. Oh, I do. And I think he's been sending me signals. And I'm feeling-- I'm just feeling different. I've never felt this way before. But something inside me is exploding. And I'm feeling like, warm and tingly. And I'm just-- I've never felt these things with Bob. But I know that there's an alien that's giving me signals. And that he's waiting for me. And that's why I know we're out here. And he's just going to-- he's going to abduct me. And he's going to grab me. And he's going to take me into the spaceship. And he's going to throw me onto the bed and I'm-- INTERVIEWER: Let me ask you a personal question? -Sure. INTERVIEWER: Have you ever thought of acting in porno films? -No. I never thought-- I work in a bank. INTERVIEWER: So you never done any porno films? -No. I'm trying to tell you that something is happening to me out here in these woods. INTERVIEWER: You've never ever-- -It's the aliens. INTERVIEWER: You've never ever done porno? -No. I haven't. It's what's happening here out in the woods. It's the aliens are giving me signals. And they're sending things through my body. God. I can't even believe you'd as me that question. It's just like, I'm feeling so good. You know, that was like a real downer what you just said. I'm feeling really-- I'm feeling so great. -You guys. I'm just totally tired, all right? I just want to rest. -That's fine. Can we take a little rest? -OK. You two rest. -Oh, my feet. -Listen, uh, Sean I, uh, think I saw something over there. I want to talk to you about it for a second, OK? Listen, you guys, uh, you stay right here. We'll be right back, OK? FELICIA: All right. Yeah. MISSY: Don't leave us. -Well, just stay right there. BOB: Listen, uh, Sean, I'm a little worried about Missy. I don't think she can take the strain of walking through the woods lie this. I'm just thinking she's going to crack up at any moment. -I don't know. I think she'll be all right. I'm actually a little more worried about Felicia. -Felicia? -Yeah. -What's wrong with Felicia? -Ah, I just think that she's-- it seems like she's getting a little bent out of shape, you know what I mean? There's stuff going on her that-- -Felicia's perfectly OK. There's nothing wrong with her. -No. Just-- -That's the way she is. She's just, you know, very neurotic. The way she combs her hair and her makeup. -Oh, she's not looking neurotic. She's-- there's something else. I mean, she's-- Missy's fine. She's fine. -OK. Listen. It's raining out now, it's going to get colder out. I think we should do is figure a way to leave them here. And you and I go on to Beaver Tail Pond. What do you think about that? -No. They'll freak. -They'll freak? You think so? -They'll freak. Yeah. It's a given. -You're probably right. They would. -Completely. -All right. Let's try to keep them calm. Tell them we only have a few more hours to go. And I think we'll be all right. Just, let's keep the ladies calm. And, uh, when we go back there, and say what were we talking about, just say, uh, you had a problem with your toe nail or something. OK? -Whatever. I'll think of something. -OK. OK. You feeling better? MISSY: Mm-hm. -All right. Let's, uh, stay here for a little bit longer. We'll go get some lunch pretty soon. In a couple of hours we'll, uh, pitch camp again. And we'll have a good night. -Oh. We're sleeping out here again? -Yeah. What's wrong with that? And then we'll, uh, hopefully we'll find the pond at any moment. All right? Is that OK with you, Sean? -It's good. -Now, if it's raining, we'll just stop. We'll be OK. Don't fucking do that. All right? You almost hit me in the eye. -I didn't hit you in the eye, Bob. -Bob, relax please. -I'm completely relaxed. You always say, relax. I'm relaxed. I may not look relaxed on the outside. But inside I'm the, like, epitome of relaxiosity. You know I mean? I'm very, very relaxed. -Right. -So don't tell me not to relax. Because when you tell me to relax, it upsets me. And then I don't get relaxed, Felicia? All right? -Don't yell at me. Fine. But don't yell at me. -Because, you know, when you said that I got up. -Fine. -I've got a lot of things on my mind. I gotta keep Missy calm. I got to keep you calm. -Forget I said it. -Sean. -I gotta keep Sean on the same planet. -Forget that I said it. I didn't say it. -And I gotta-- I gotta do everything. All right? -Fine. -I have to do everything. All right? So let's go. Get up. Come on. -I'm not saying another word the whole trip. BOB: All right. Look what I see. MISSY: Oh, my god. We found the pond. Yes. SEAN: I don't see a path anywhere. SEAN: What are you talking about? -We're supposed to find the Dead Man's Trail, remember? FELICIA: Yeah. And a wall. Something-- this-- this isn't right. SEAN: This isn't it . -This is-- you know, the direction from Twig Man. MISSY: This has to be it. This is it. FELICIA: I mean, Twig Man is nuts. -There's no other pond around here. It has to be it. This is Beaver Tail Pond. -This isn't it. I can tell that's not it. -What? This isn't the pond? -It is the pond. There's no sign there that says this is the pond. But we're assuming this is the pond. SEAN: We want that sign, Bob. -There isn't going to be a sign. SEAN: We need the sign. FELICIA: I'm not leaving. FELICIA: But there's supposed to be-- BOB: I'm going to go look for the path. -I'm not leaving. I'm staying here. Right here. I'm not moving anymore. I'm tired. This is my-- this is my-- Sean, are you staying with me? BOB: Missy, come on. MISSY: No. I'm staying. BOB: I'm going to leave you here. MISSY: Fine. Go. BOB: Missy, come on. SEAN: I don't know, Miss. Fuck this, man. -What, honey? -You know, I don't know. -What? Yeah, but we found the pond. -It's not the pond. -What do you mean it's not the pond? -It could be your pond. It's not the pond. -This is the pond. This is the pond. -No. This is bullshit. Let's get out of here. -Where are we going to go? -Fucking bullshit. Fuck him, man. Fuck him. Let's get out of here. He doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. He's on some fucking power trip or some shit. I don't know. I'm tell you. -All right. -What do you mean all right? -OK. -Yeah? -OK. -OK. Listen, we go to go. This is the pond. We found the pond, Missy. Sean, we found the pond. You know that's right. -It's not the pond, Bob. -Come on. Let's go. Let's go. -Fine. Fine. -Come on. Everyone stick together. We have to stay together. We've come this far. BOB: You go first. FELICIA: OK. Thank you. MISSY: I'm going to cry. FELICIA: No, you're not. MISSY: I miss my kitties. SEAN: Come here, it's all right. BOB: You'll have plenty of time for that when you come home. -He's, like a great boyfriend. He takes care of me. And, you know, he's really cool. And Felicia's awesome. She's just-- we talk about boys and makeup and stuff. She's really cool, you know? I mean, it's like she's not even older than me. You know? It's almost like she's my age. It's like she's a sister or something, you know? But, um, well, Bob you know. Kind of a dork. But that's OK. Because we all are here to do one thing. And we're just going to get money. [GUITAR MUSIC] -Hey, Sean. SEAN: Yeah? -Where's Missy? -What are you talking about? -She's not here. -What do you mean? -Where is she? -I thought she was with you guys. -Wait a minute. Let's listen and see if we hear anything. Missy? -Miss? -Missy? -Missy? -OK. Go look for her. But just stay in the general area. Don't go too far. [CALLING] [SCREAM] BOB: What's wrong? All right. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. It's just a doll nailed to a tree. It doesn't mean anything. It's just a doll nailed to a tree. It doesn't fucking mean anything. -That's fucked up. -You know what this could mean, Sean? This means-- you know what this means? This means the aliens are nearby. What else could it possibly mean? We're in the middle of nowhere. We're probably near the alien. -That's not aliens, man. -It's aliens. -No, that's something else. -It even looks like her a little bit. -Oh, don't you get it? This is Missy? -Yeah, that's obviously Missy. Now we're going to discuss what to do about that. -OK. -And I think what-- -Fuck the lake. I need to find Missy. It's very important to me. -No, you stay here. We agreed we're going to go to the lake. -OK. I think the aliens are friendly. I think that's something else. -And the fact that Missy is missing is your fault. Your problem. -Fine. -Not our problem. -Fine. -Missy is your problem. -Fine. -This is the situation. Sean, listen, I can't spend too much time looking for Missy, here. OK? Why don't you just stay here. -Whoa, we're on a schedule? -She's probably collecting flowers. You know she's an idiot. -Collecting flowers in this shit? -I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. -Bob, don't say that. -I didn't mean to say she's an idiot. All right? She's not an idiot. All right? She's very, very bright. But she likes to collect flowers. And that's what's going on here. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Missy? -What is this? What's this? -Hey, that's Missy's phone. -Oh, we've got a phone. -Missy's phone? -We can call for, you know, help. -Why the hell didn't she tell us she had a cellphone? -Call 411. -No. 411? That's the information. We want the police. -Find out where we are. See if they know where the spaceship is. -All right. Police? Hello? Is this the police? Beaver Tail Lake police? Listen, we were out here looking for the alien. And there were four of us. Now there's only three of us. Yeah, the alien. And we saw this guy, Twig Man. You might know about-- No, I'm not insane. I'm not insane. Hello? No. I'm not insane. What? Hello? Hello? -What happened? BOB: He hung up. -Real fucking smart. Alien? You're the only one on the planet who believes in the alien. He's going to be like, freak. -Sean, why didn't Missy tell us she had this? That's what I want to know. Here, you give this back to Missy if you find her-- if you find here. And tell her, next time tell, us when she has a cell phone. -Oh, now it's fucking dead. What'd you do to it? -If there is a next time. OK? -Missy? Missy? -He busted it. -He didn't break the phone. Missy? BOB: Where is she, Sean? -Uh, you know, I'd pull her out if I had her in my pocket, Bob. -Picking daisies no doubt. That's where we're going to find her. Picking fucking daisies. [SCREAMING] -Oh, my god. Are you bleeding? Miss? Miss? Miss? MISSY: I'm going to hang myself. BOB: Is she putting makeup on? -I want my lipstick. I want my lipstick. -This is not normal behavior. This is really-- BOB: Give me that. -Get away from me. BOB: What the hell difference does it make putting makeup on? No one's going to see in the middle of the woods, Missy. SEAN: Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie, come here. 1, 2, 3. Counting. Counting. Counting, counting, counting. FELICIA: You need to get her help when you go home. -We're wasting too much time putting makeup on in the middle of the woods. I'm so beautiful. Don't you think I'm so attractive? SEAN: What the hell is he talking about? -Come on. Let's go. FELICIA: You know, when you go home, you need to get her help. BOB: She needs help. That's right. She needed help the day she was born. Now let's go. FELICIA: It's not normal behavior. MISSY: I'm falling off a cliff. I'm falling off a cliff. Am I at home yet? Am I at home? My bed. I need my bed. SEAN: Get up -This is my bed. Goodnight, honey. -Come on. Miss, Miss, Miss? -What, what, what, what, what? -Bob, wait for us. I'm realizing, like, I just can't live like this anymore. And I know, I know I'm going to find one of those aliens and he's going to take me away in that spaceship. And that's really what I pray for. I love Missy and Sean. I mean, they're really, really good people. And, you know, Bob is Bob. And I love Bob, but he's-- he's such a dork. And I'm realizing out here, like, he's just, he's a dork. INTERVIEWER: In what way? -In every possible way. And sexually mostly. -When I married Felicia, I thought she was a stable, really down-to-earth person. And, uh, you know, as a result of this trip I think, quite frankly, she's like a stark raving lunatic of some kind. And, uh, I just don't know what's going to happen after this whole thing is over. Either she's going to take off. Or I'm going to take off. Or, uh, you know, we'll strangle each other. Or I'll blow my brains out with a gun. OK, listen. We got to get up really early tomorrow morning, Missy and Sean. So what I want you to do is go right back to you tent and go right to sleep so we can get up bright and early and go to Beaver Tail Lake. OK? I want to get a lot accomplished tomorrow. All right? So go back to your tent right now and go right to sleep. You understand? You understand? FELICIA: Yes. You don't have to tell me, like, when to go to sleep. -We go to go right to sleep. What the fuck was that? -Oh, my god. -Shit. -It was from right over there. About 100 feet away. Listen. I'm going to go check it out. -No, no, I'll check it out. I'll check it out. -Yeah, good idea, Sean. Go check it out. All right? -Are you sure he's OK by himself? BOB: He'll be all right. Just be careful, Sean, OK? We don't know what's out there. -Sean? -Sean? BOB: Sean? -Sean? -Sean, honey? -Why isn't he answering us? -I don't know. -Jesus Christ. -I think I should go. I think I should go. -No, you stay here. We don't need two people lost. Sean? Are you OK? -I was just shitting with you guys. You miss me? BOB: You know, Sean, maybe if you smoked less of that dope, you'd be less of a dope. Did you ever think about that? -Maybe if you smoked dope you'd be less of a freaking, uptight freaking insurance dude. -Yeah, well, maybe that's why you work in a video store. Some guy comes in, gives you $1, and you give him a videotape. What's the big deal with that? -What's so fucking cool about insurance, Bob? BOB: Hey, hey, listen, Sean, insurance is really important. Because if we didn't have it. We wouldn't even be here tonight. We wouldn't even be here tonight. Because we would have no car. And we wouldn't have been able to drive up here. SEAN: Who needs a car, man? BOB: Insurance is extremely important. I work really hard at the insurance office. -He does. BOB: You work at the goddamned video store. Somebody gives you $0.50, and you give them a blank tape. But I work in an office that does important things. FELICIA: Sean, it's an important job. BOB: I'm sorry I got mad at you, Sean. I really am sorry. -No, Bob, man, no. BOB: I'm sorry that-- maybe I'm sorry that you even came up here this weekend. Maybe I should be sorry that I even asked you to come. Maybe the whole idea was completely stupid. FELICIA: Honey. -Bob, why you got to be like that, man? BOB: I'm a normal person. I really am normal. -Agitated right now. BOB: I'm really normal. I'm just a normal as you are. SEAN: Dude, the trip you're on is just going out. BOB: You're normal. I'm normal. Missy's normal. And Felicia's normal. But I'm just as normal as you. OK? Let's just agree. What? OK? Well, Sean was giving me a hard time. MISSY: He's a very, very troubled man. -Let's face it. Everything that's happened this week is because I had the idea. It was my idea to come up here. -Honey, you don't smoke. BOB: It was my idea to make a list to decide what we're going to do. When Missy freaked out, you know, I was the one who remained calm. What have you done? The whole time we've been up here, for the last two days, what have you done? You haven't done anything, Sean. -Bob, all that's fucking cool and shit. But it doesn't help the fact that you're still a dork. -Don't call me a dork, Sean, when you're in the pot-smoking video store dork. And I'm not. And there's nothing wrong with working in a goddamn insurance office. I'm proud of working in insurance. OK? We should all be thankful that I have some iota of the brain and could come up with something that will make us $100,000. Because if we make $25,000 each, Sean, you'll be able to get out of that video store. And Missy, you'll be able to get the gerbils you want or whatever the hell it is you need. Right? -Well, I just want hamsters and gerbils. -OK. And Felicia won't have to work at the bank anymore. She can probably stay home and watch her soap operas all day, right? And you can thank me if all those things go down tomorrow. OK? That's all I'm going to say. So I'll see you bright and early, everybody, 6 o'clock tomorrow morning. See you then. -Honey, I mean. You want me to come with you? MISSY: What's his problem? -I can't find my backpack. Does anybody care that I can't find my back pack? It has a second map in it. Felicia, it has your makeup in it. INTERVIEWER: What do you think aliens look like? Do you think they look human? -Well, if you think about, I mean, everything around us could be an alien. I mean, we don't know what they look like. So if we don't know what they look like, then theoretically everything-- everything around here-- that tree. Uh, you know, you could be an alien. These leaves on the ground. I could be an alien. I mean, how do you know for sure that you're not talking to an alien right now? I could be an alien. INTERVIEWER: Are you and alien. -I'm not an alien. I actually have a driver's license. Let me show that to you right now. Here it is. That's my driver's license showing that I am licensed to drive a car. A vehicle. So I don't think-- I think you would agree that an alien would not have that. Right? And-- do you want a credit card? BOB: Hello? Hello? Damn, the want $0.85 cents for the first three minutes. Can you fucking believe that? Hello? Listen, we're out here in the middle of nowhere. Please? Hello, operator? FELICIA: That was our last chance. I know it was our last chance. -It wasn't our last chance. Don't worry about it. Felicia, it'll be all right. Don't worry about it. Come on. Come on, let's go. We got to keep moving. Come on. It will be all right. -OK, Bob. -I'm just trying to calm you down. Now let's go. Everything will be OK. It's a temporary setback. It's a payphone. And it wanted some money. And we didn't have any money. So it's no big deal. We'll find another payphone. -What the fuck is this? What does this look like to you, Sean? SEAN: Looks like something I made in summer camp. MISSY: No. It's like a kite or something. FELICIA: It's, like, a weird kite or something. -No, no, no. This looks like some cheap movie prop. That's what it looks like to me. Wait a minute. What's this over here? SEAN: What? -It looks like there's something under that stone. SEAN: It's just a rock. -Go check it out, Sean. I'll hold this. Go check that out. -Fine. It's just a fucking rock. BOB: Get back everybody. SEAN: Oh, Jesus. What the fuck is that shit? FELICIA: Gross. SEAN: Don't touch it. FELICIA: Don't touch it, Bob. -Too late now, I already touched it. -Your fingers are going to fall off. BOB: Don't you realize what all this means? You know what this means? FELICIA: What? -This is some kind of sentinel from the aliens. They put it here as a signal that they're in the area. And they want us to find them. -Fuck that. It's some demented camp counselor, man. -It Isn't. It's a sentinel. Sean, I think we should walk down there and follow this dried up riverbed. -Get away from that thing. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Fucking shit. FELICIA: It's the same lake. -We're going around in circles. All right, don't freak out, Missy, on me again. Please. -You kept us up here for three days. It's the same lake. -Maybe it just looks like the same place. MISSY: You know? There's only one reason why you brought us up here. There's only one reason. BOB: What's that? -Remember last night? He tried to kiss me, pervert. -I didn't try to kiss you. MISSY: You're a pervert. -You're a liar. -Don't you even think about it. -You're a fucking liar. FELICIA: What would you guys have been doing anyway? -I didn't try to do anything on you. FELICIA: Sean would have been home getting stoned and you'd be home doing nothing. [INTERPOSING VOICES] INTERVIEWER: Did you throw a pass at Missy? -Uh, the only pass I've ever thrown at Missy was when we were playing football a couple weeks ago. That was the only pass I've ever thrown at her. I've never touched her, I've never felt her up, I've never, you know, taken my pants off in front of her or anything like that. -Not only are you a pervert-- -What are you talking about pervert? -You made a move on me last night. FELICIA: You made a move on her? I doubt it. [INAUDIBLE] -It doesn't matter. I doesn't even matter. -You're a spoiled brat. Prima donna. -We're all tired. I'm tired. -You get lost every second. -You shut the fuck up. -You shut up. And don't say anything about him. -I like Sean and Missy. I've always liked them. That's why I wanted them to come over. Because I personally don't have a lot of friends. I mean, I have a few friends. Well, actually, I have one friend. But he's in Nevada. -None of this really matters. It doesn't matter because we're not at the right pond. We never found a UFO. Even if we had found a UFO, it doesn't matter because nobody brought a movie camera and what distributor is going to distribute a film without a UFO in it? [DIAL TONE] INTERVIEWER: So how did the big adventure go? -I think it went pretty well. I'm-- I'm really happy that I did it. I can't speak for the other people. But I personally am happy we went out there. I think we saw what was a UFO. What was an alien spacecraft. We couldn't improve it. But I'm glad I went. And, uh, you know, I'd go again. I don't know if I'd go with the same people. I probably wouldn't go out there with Felicia again. -Well, you know, what was-- it was difficult. It was rainy and we were tired and I didn't get much sleep. But the experience was the best thing that ever happen to me. It change my life. -Um, the trip? Which one? The, uh-- INTERVIEWER: You went hiking recently. -Oh, right right. With, uh, Felicia. And, um, -Bob. -Bob. -Oh, it was, uh, it was kind of. I don't know. What did you? I thought it was kind of a downer, honestly. It was really a big buzz stomp. INTERVIEWER: Where's Felicia? -Um, Felicia, actually we separated about a month ago. And as far as I know, she's now seeing a construction worker. -I am just so happy right now. I can't even tell you. I mean, this man is just fabulous. I can't even-- I can't even talk about. INTERVIEWER: Do you believe in UFOs? SEAN: No. MISSY: Ooh, that's a toughy. You know, I keep my mind open. Because you never know really, what's out there. -Oh, I definitely believe in aliens. I'm positive that we encountered the aliens. -I think we did see aliens. There are definitely aliens out there in the universe somewhere. And I'm still convinced of that. -I think the closest thing that I know to an alien is fucking Bob. -I talked to a couple of scientists when I got back. And they said it sounded like an alien spacecraft. And I wouldn't be surprised if there had been. -I know that we definitely encountered them. And there were things that happened out in the woods that were because of the aliens. -Bob insists-- -So does Felicia. -Up and down that this thing was a UFO. I, you know, it could've been anything. -I know that they were-- they were in the atmosphere. They were there. Because things were happening to me that was about the aliens. -You know, I don't get it. The whole fascination with aliens. It's, I mean, sure there's other stuff going on but-- -You know, we did find that spaceship. But Bob left the camera at home. -I'm disappointed we get the $100,000 reward money because we didn't have any pictures. And we didn't have any proof. That there was a spaceship out there. -I've got this little theory that, honestly, it was like-- -Monster trucks. -Monster trucks. Like, just parked. I mean, I don't know. It's just like-- -I think there was a rally that day that we missed. -The light. -Yeah. -I believe in aliens. I always believed in aliens. And I still do. And I think that people in general out there should believe in aliens. And if they see one, don't let people tell them that it isn't one. -No. There's not. -I guess they had just-- they went back. Or maybe we scared them off. So that part wasn't meant to be. But my life was changed. -I believe in a galaxy far, far away there are alien beings. And that one day, everybody here on earth will meet one. -I mean, Bob's just not the right guy for me. And I needed and adventure like this to really awakened myself. And to see that I just need something different. -Sean and I dot real close. And we're engaged now. So I guess it kind of worked out for the best. You know? Cause we got closer. You know? -Sean and Missy? I still talk to them. As a matter of fact, they're due over here in about 45 minutes. And I don't know what we're going to be doing. We probably won't be looking for a UFO. I know that. We'll probably-- I don't know, we'll probably just go bowling. [MUSIC PLAYING] INTERVIEWER: Rolling. Action. [SCREAM] -Is that all right?
