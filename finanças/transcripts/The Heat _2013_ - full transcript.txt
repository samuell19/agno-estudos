? Hah ? Ooh ? Hey ? Hah ? Huh ? Uh ? Time is truly wastin' ? There's no guarantee, yeah ? Smile is in the makin' ? We got to fight the powers that be ? ? Got so many voices ? Saying all the same, yeah ? Killing up all around me ? Faces full of pain ? I tried to play my music ? They say my music's too loud ? I tried talking about it ? I got the big runaround ? And when I rolled with the punches ? ? I got knocked on the ground ? By all this bullshit going down, hey ? ? Time is truly wastin' ? There's no guarantee, yeah ? Smile is in the makin' ? We got to fight the powers that be ? ? Yeah ? Fight, fight the powers ? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... Okay... Huh? Oh, my God, it means: "Cover me, go left. " Read the manual, why don't you? Wait for my three count. And one, two... Unbelievable. FBI! Freeze! FBI! Hands on top of your head! Don't move! Get 'em up! Okay, calm down, okay, man? On your head! Hey, calm down, tough guy. Surprise. We've checked everywhere. There's nothing. Well, place is clean, Ashburn. Looks like your theory has a few holes in it. Let's roll, boys. So you think it's clean, huh? Oh, here we go. Yeah, that's what they... that's what they said last year right before I arrested the Red Falls Killer. What are those? Barbecue spareribs? Is that what that is? I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. Or... ...maybe I'm not. Yeah. Airtight. Dipped in wax. I respect that. I especially like the meat to distract the dog. And while that may have fooled the loudest breather in the world, it did not fool me. And, unfortunately, it's not what I'm looking for. So why don't we just cut to the chase? Are there guns in this house? I don't know anything about any guns. Interesting. Maybe I'm wrong. You know? Mm, wait for it. Maybe these guys are... are right for a change. Stranger things have happened, right, guys? Mm, that's a trap. Meteors, comets. Somebody married Pete, and he can't even count to three. Uhuh. See? Right there? So frustrating. You know, they loved these houses during the Prohibition Era. You guys know what prohibition is, don't you? Yeah, selling your ass for money? Really? Really? No. No, it was, uh, alcohol. People loved to drink it, even though they weren't supposed to, and these houses had all these little nooks and crannies where they could hide it. Like this one. Is there something behind me? There is, isn't there? Fuck. Now you can roll. Gentlemen. Nice work, dick. Jesus. Let's go. Ooh... Hard to believe she's single. Oh! Immediately below that, you feel a little crease... Wow, that's pretty impressive, huh? Do you see that? Look at that. We'd want to make an incision right through there. That's pretty amazing, huh? Pretty amazing. Pumpkin! Here, kitty, kitty. Are you at the neighbor's again? Pumpkin! Here, kitty, kitty. Go on home. I'll see you tomorrow. There you go. Pumpkin, I told you to stay away from that weird lady. Yo, taxi! Mmhmm. No, no, no, o lo lo... lo siento. No, hay a poder llegar temprano, llamar de los vecinos y diles que... Lo siento. Perd√≥n. Oh, boy. Wife doesn't like you working late, huh? What do you want? Oh, just, uh, letting you know that I have been observing the agents, overseeing what they've been up to, you know, keeping an eye on them. Yeah. Supervising. Supervising. Yes, sir. Look, Ashburn... I haven't made any decisions yet. Oh... of course not. Every... everyone deserves a shot. I don't know if you are the right person for this position. I'm s... I'm sorry, what? What? I'm confused. Walk with me. Sir, I don't... I don't understand. I've closed more cases than any agent here. Should I not have done that? You are a solid agent. There are many other solid agents. Well, none of them have closed the Red Falls Killer case. Ashburn, it's no secret that none of the other agents like you. What? I've gotten countless complaints of arrogance and competitiveness, showmanship. Just give it a rest. All right. We've got a situation in Boston. The Feds picked up chatter on a guy moving in. Simon Larkin. We don't know what he looks like, where he comes from, nothing. We believe this guy is doing the legwork for him. Julian Vincent, nasty son of a bitch. Murder, extortion. This is his M.O. The problem with guys like that is that everyone's too scared to talk. Pack your bags. I'm sending you to Boston. You know how to get inside people's heads. You want to find Larkin, get to Julian. You do well with this, we can talk about the job. ? Whoo! ? She's got stickers on her locker ? ? And the boy's number's there in Magic Marker ? ? I'm hungry and the hunger will linger ? ? I eat 16 saltine crackers ? Then I lick my fingers ? Well, every morning I deliver the news ? ? Black hat, white shoes... Hey, Rojas sent me over. He said you were really nice. Yeah, baby, what are you looking for? What's your name? Champaz. What's yours? Champaz? Did your mom give you that name? Not exactly. Hey, Mullins. Captain wants to know when you're coming in. Hey, you know what? Tell him I'll be there sharply at, uh, gofuckyourself o'clock. Okay? If there's no traffic. Thank you. That seems kind of expensive. Expensive? Can you break a hundred? I got a hundred right here. No, baby, I'm not going to break a hundred. All right, let me see. I don't think I have that. Wow. My God, do you have, like, a discount? Hey, what's going on here? Okay, I don't want any drugs, all right? Oh. No. Hi. How you doing? Are you trying to get a... a deal on my girl here? Are you her pimp? No, we're just friends. Isn't that right? Okay, well, it's... I think this is just kind of... between her and I, so let's... Am I kind of invading your space here? Kind of. I don't want to do that. Let me see if this will help you. All right, look, I... I just wanted to... Oh. Well, it... it's, uh... it's a good thing I didn't get the drugs from you. Yeah, can you imagine that? That would have been... That would have been crazy. That would have been bad. That would have been bad. Yeah, right? Whew! You'd better wipe that brow. Listen, um... Thanks. I got to ask, Yeah, yeah, yeah. you know, whatever... Yeah, yeah, yeah. what was... what was actually going on here? Oh, we were just, um... She looked kind of sad, so I just... I kind of thought I'd help her out and give her a ride home. That's nice, like a Good Samaritan. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Were you depressed? Was he giving you a ride home? Yeah, I was kind of cheering you up. Yeah, good for you. You know who else is pretty sad? Frank over here. Right, Frank, you get sad 'cause you shit and piss yourself? You having a sad day, Frank? Hey, maybe you can put him in the back of your car... You want to shit and piss all over this guys car? You know what, let's open up the... Frank, you want to shit your pants and get in the... Oh, good, it's open. I can put, uh, Frank in there. Okay. He can shit and piss himself... Okay. ...until he's happy. I got some towels. I can put some towels... Does that sounds good? Yeah, sure. Why don't you let me see your I.D. there? Oh, come on, please. Um... Yeah, hey, let me just take the whole thing. I don't... Yeah, it's good. It's... I got it. Oh, good. You know what? I got nervous that maybe you didn't have a wife and a whole bunch of kids, but... but luckily, you do. What's your wife's name? Her name is Bella. Oh, Bella. Good. Hey, can I borrow your phone for a minute? My... yeah, my... my battery's out. Why do you want to borrow my phone? Because I asked you for your phone. Give me your fucking phone. Shut your mouth. Can't you just, like, g give me one chance here? Yeah, I'll give you one chance. Hello? Yeah, who's this? Is this Bella? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! That's... Don't do that. Don't do that. Ow! My God! Don't do that. Yes, this is Officer Mullins. God! I'm here with your husband. God, what are you, Spock? No. No, he's not been in an accident, unfortunately. I just, uh... II do have him here with a known prostitute. God! She's lying! Bella, she's lying! Oh, that's not the first time, huh? God. Yeah, that's him. He's crying 'cause I'm breaking his fucking hand. God. Oh, she said do it harder. All right, Bella. Ow! God! That's for Bella. Well, you got to go with your instincts, Bella. Yep, you're welcome. Yep, she's probably going to burn your shit today, so... Come on, look, you don't understand, all right? She just had a baby. There's a lot going on down there. I'm not going to touch that. Why don't you take your, uh, seat belt off for a minute? Oh, come on, please... come on. Yeah. No, you seem like a reasonable guy. You look like you got... Take your fucking belt off. And you look like you got some compassion. Listen, I love... I love the sound of a guy that, after his wife gives him his fifth fucking child, complains about her messy vagina. And then you don't want to fucking touch her! Get out of the fucking car. I can unlock the door for you. What the fuck, man? Get out of the fucking car! Get out of the fucking car! Are you kidding me? Come on! Get up against the car. What is your problem? You asked for my phone... Turn around. You want to do that? Do you want to do that? It's hot! The car is hot! Good! I hope it burns your fucking dick off! Hey, it's Rojas, my favorite asshole. Yeah, look what I found. Oh, no, did I take some of your business away? That's a real shame. Lady, I don't even know what you're talking about. I just stand on this corner, and I just do my "sodukas," okay? Oh, is that right? First of all, it's "soduko," dumbass. And you want to tell me that you're just here coincidentally, right in the... right in the middle of all the prostitutes? Lady, tell me this... why are you so obsessed with me? You should be ashamed of yourself, trying to break down a successful black man. You racist? And don't play that race bullshit card with me! Nine out of ten guys I fuck are black guys. Lady, what I think you need to do... you need to go down the road, take a vacation, okay? And go get your groove back. Lady, just relax, chill, okay? What is that? Take off. Yeah, that's what I thought. I'm not a part of this! Shut up! Shut up! Stop! Oh! Oh! Oh, my God! ? Yeah, I was right all along ? Yeah Oh, my God! Oh, it's on! She's crazy! ? Yeah Come on, please let me out. I get really carsick. Please, please, please, please Oh, no, that's terrible. No, come on. Oh, my God! I got him now. I got him, I got him. You are a meth head! Oh, my God! Hey, look who's here. Oh! You just hit him! ? So what you waiting for? Yeah, you better run. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I got him. I got him! Oh, God! You piece of shit, I said stop. I said... I said stop! I said stop! Just get off me! You're crushing my balls! I hope they fucking rupture! Lady, get the fuck off of me! You're going to fucking... What the hell is wrong with you? Bella, I'm sorry! Let me go! Hold still, you piece of shit! Ow! My leg, lady! Let me go! No! No! Lady, what the hell is wrong with you? I'll tell you what the hell's the matter with me. It's you, piece of shit. Son of a bitch. Stop moving! Leave me alone. Leave me alone! Get off me! Shit. Get off me! Shit. Yeah. Man, lady, what the hell did you throw at me? A watermelon. A watermelon? Ah, hell, no! See, I told you you was a racist. Yeah? I tried to hit you with my car. What's that make me? Yeah, let's see what you got in... Oh, look at this. Look at this. Not even my birthday. Hey, man, you planted that shit on me, man! Yeah, I planted it, yeah. You planted that on me! I'm innocent! Shut up before I feed you watermelon. Get up. Levy? Yeah. Federal Agent Sarah Ashburn from the New York field office. Hi. How are you? I'm going to need all your files on all known drug dealers of the area. Right. We heard you were coming. Actually, I was expecting you. Ah. I'll show you to your desk. Oh, that won't be necessary. I won't be here long. Okay. Okay. So I can carry these. Thank you. Where is it? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey! Ashburn! Ashburn! Oh! Ooh. Oh, God. You okay? What? What is it? What is it? Okay. Lowend dealer just brought into the East Boston precinct. All right. Name's Terrell Rojas. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Thank you very much. Good... good luck out there. It's not about luck, pal. Not about luck. Wow. That was almost cool. Almost. Come on, come on, come on. Ain't going to fucking park today? All right. Here we go. Finally. Hey! I'm moving in there! No, don't...! Hey, hey, hey! No, get back in your car. Hey! Hey! Hey, asshole! Goddamn it. FBI. Hey, you need to sign in. Come on. Let's go. Captain Woods? Captain Woods? Christ. I'm sorry? Uh, how can I help you? Special Agent Sarah Ashburn. We got intel recently that you brought in a dealer by the name of Terrell Rojas. Uh, yeah, but Detective Mullins isn't back from lunch yet. I'm sure he won't mind. Well, he's a she, and we're not really allowed to go near her collars. Let me tell you what I think. I think that every second we're standing here is interfering with the federal investigation. So, if you'd be so kind as to show Mr. Rojas to an interrogation room. Thank you. Special Agent? Yes. This way. Okay. Special Agent? Yes. Special Agent? Shit. You are looking at possession with intent, which is a class D drug charge, chapter 94C, section 32A. I had a joint and a few little bags of coke. Since when is that shit illegal? The answer to your question is always. And with your priors, you are looking at 25 years and some pretty stiff fines. Who the hell cares about fines? That's 25 years! Never mind. Let's see what you make of these. Huh? What do you make of these? What I make of them is that somebody doesn't want somebody else selling on their turf. But you're still here. And you're alive. Why is that? Who you working for? Nobody. Who you working for? Who you working for? Nobody. Nobody! If I tell you, that's my ass chopped up into a million motherfucking pieces! Goddamn it. Fucker. God. Push! This motherfucker! Everybody's got to fucking park in my spot. Goddamn it! Shit! Suitwearing, god... Ow! Fuck! God. Yeah, I said I'm... fucking parking there. That doesn't... Steal my goddamn fucking space. I don't want you to do time. I don't want you to get chopped up into little, tiny, mothereffin' pieces. Oh. I can protect you. I can. But you got, you got to help me. I can help you. You're gonna help me? Yeah. Tell me where I can find Julian. I don't deal with him like that. I get my stuff from this bitch named Tatiana on Newkirk Avenue. Can you describe her to me? Well, she got brown eyes. Okay. Mm, she got some bigass "breastses. " Big breastses. Okay. Can you maybe be a little bit more specific? Uh... like... her breastses is like this. Okay. Thank you. That's a shame. Don't. Oh, haha, oh, yeah! We're at a comedy party, yeah. Move the fuck out of my way. Get a room. Tim, you still owe me 40. Yeah, tomorrow it's 60. Fucking dickweed. Why is the cage empty? What have I told you about moving my prisoners? He's in interrogation. Why would he be in interrogation when I'm standing right here? Theythey came and got him. Who's "they"? Better be two of me. Is it two of me? It was a lady. She was... I'm a lady. Did I come and get him? No, no, it was a different lady; she was nice. I'm fuckin' nice. No, no. Why was she nice to you? She made me give her the keys. I'm gonna make you fucking bend over, and I'm gonna reach up your ass into your pocket and get the keys to your house. And then I'm gonna drive there, come in your front fucking door and kill you in your sleep. I think I have a clear idea of what we're looking for, and I appreciate your time. Wow, lady, you're on a real fuckin' roll. Excuse me? I... Yeah, no, I won't excuse you. I just spent the last 30 minutes thinking of different ways to kill you. I... I'm... I'm sorry, when did we meet? What is this, your lawyer? I'm... What are you, insurance salesman? Do you sell those shitty suits? I'm Special Agent Sarah Ashburn. How can I help you? You can get all of that, get it up, and get it the fuck out of here, 'cause this is my room. Were you, were you about to be, uh, questioned by a detective? I am a detective, and that's my perp. Ah. Ah, I... I understand now. Well, um, Detective, Mr. Rojas will be continuing on with me at this point. No. It's a jurisdictional issue. No, not gonna happen. And so, uh, youryour efforts areare duly noted. Thank you so much. Oh, great. And if you're okay with everything, could you justjust maybe close the door on the way out? I'll shut the door on you. Will you lay down here and put your head in the door? And I'll slam it about 157,000 fucking times. Aw, shit, girl, you better run. You need to shut your mouth. Run like you on fire. You need to be quiet. You're gonna get up, and we're gonna settle this outside. Okay, now I'm... I won't be going outside. You're gonna get up and you're gonna come outside. No, ma'am. Not going outside. Fine. We'll do this inside. Can somebody please remove this person from the interrogation room? We're good! Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of. It runs in many families. I'm gonna hit you. You're not gonna hit me. Please don't. I'm gonna hit you and knock all your little buttons. Do not point your finger... I'm gonna hit you there... No, do not put your finger in my... Stop touching my buttons, stop touching... Well, stop wearing buttons. Don't you... Don't you move those fucking hands again. I'll get that stupid barrette. H Hey, hey! I'll take that barrette right out of your fucking hair! Hey, stop! Oh, stop, stop, stop! Hey, both of you, my office now. Nope. Not in there. There is nothing I can do, Mullins. The FBI has jurisdiction. Maybe they're in here. Maybe they're in here. Aw, come on. Nope. Stop. Will you stop? Nope, they're not in there. Let me see. What is she doing? They're not under there. She's looking for my balls. Oh. Hey, if anyone sees the captain's balls, let me know! They're about this big, but a lot tinier. They're like a pea, or like a, like a ball bearing, or like, if you've ever seen a mouse ball, about half that size. Incredibly tiny. They're like really, really tiny, little girl balls, if little girls had balls. So if you find little, tiny, girl balls that are so fucking tiny and shriveled up, let me know, 'cause I'll put them right back up his scrotum! Knock it off, Mullins. How about you do something for once? What do you want me to do?! Uh, I'd like you to have my back and stop being so goddamn disappointing like everybody else. Oh, well, that was professional. Oh, is that not professional? Here. Let me, let me be professional. Let me help you pick up your bag. That's very mature. Let me just straighten that shit up. Oh, wait, hey, hey! Good news! Good news! I found his balls! Yeah, in a clear sack! Yeah, enjoy that. Shove those back up there. Cop of the Year! Keep it up! This job is destroying me. You know how old I am? Uh, uh, 58? I'm 43 years old. Mmhmm, mmhmm. Well, I always, see, I always round up. I have a fiveyearold son who calls me Grandpa. So, uh, anywho, uh, sir, if, um... if you could just, you know, keep her away from me, that would be... be very helpful. She stole your keys, didn't she? Yes, she did. Do you know where I can find her? She's probably at O'Flanagan's. It's a bar down the street. Now, it's a little divey. You might want to wear a vest. ? Okay, I'm Rambo, I ramshack ? I'm next to that cheese like rat traps ? ? On top of that green like grass ass ? ? That's over y'all head like snapbacks ? ? I get it where I fit in, put up then I put in ? ? Tryin' to find an ass I can put my fucking foot in ? ? Run this shit, no, I run this shit ? ? Don't give one fuck, bitch, I done this shit... ? Sir, is this... is this place open? Is there a door...? Oh, wow. Wow, okay, so there is. Could you, um, could you point it out to me? With... with your fin... with your finger. Please. Thank you. Thank you very much. ? Here I come again, now, baby ? Like a dog in heat... Hand them over. Give me the keys. Now. Oh, my God. Did you drop something? Apologize. Apologies. You are so concerned about taking down a guy like Rojas when we have just wasted all this time, when I could have stopped a drug lord who is far more dangerous and supplies to people like Rojas. Bullshit. Oh, really? Who? Oh. Okay, you want to see some bull feces? I think I said bullshit, is what I said. Here you go. Here's some bull poopoo. How's this for bull feces? How does that look? Huh? See that? Oh, come on. I got a kid here. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm, I'm very sorry, very sorry. Wait a minute, this is a bar. This is a b... No, absolutely not. Nononononono. Nonononono. Why do I not know who Simon Larkin is? Uh, that would probably be because the FBI knows more than you do. Uh, anything that's happening in my neighborhood, I have a right to know. Uh, no, you actually don't. You want to know. And you do not have the clearance that would allow you to read everything that is on this file, okay? Okay, all right! You know, when bad shit happens in my neighborhood, I get a little passionate about it. I shouldn't have read your files. I went too far. Well, I... I accept your apology. But you need to understand that this is a highly important case and the information is highly, highly sensitive. Therefore, we have these clearances that mean... I don't have the clearances. I don't have the clearances, right? I mean, you're... you are, wow, FBI. Yes. I mean, you are... you're a goddamn angel of the law. Well, I... that's a little... You know, I want you to spread those wings out and just soar. While I appreciate the sentiment... Hey! ...it's certainly not... Watch it. You watch it. I'm a federal agent. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Well, guess what, you dick. I'm a federal agent, too. I work at the post office. Well, I... I appreciate the work you do for us down on the ground. Thank you. Thank you. Bet your ass you do. I can see no one will be getting their mail today. Wow. Good burn. Good burn. You got burned, you big drunk paddy! Kiss my cunt, you twat! Yeah. So we are... Hey. We are good? Thank you. Thank you. Hey, America thanks you. And I, it. And it, you. Thank you. Whoaoa. Yes, okay. Good day. Dumbass. All prisoners, clear the yards. So how you been, Jason? You want to talk about Simon Larkin? Uh, I never heard of him. Don't fucking lie to me. You're my goddamn brother; I know when you're lying. I'm just a lowlevel guy. Okay? I heard of Larkin, but, you know, I never met him. Yeah, well, he's a goddamn animal, and I'm trying to keep him from meeting you. What, are you gonna storm through Boston and take down a drug lord? Yeah, I might. Have you met me? Yeah, unfortunately. Yeah, shut up. Look, I get out tomorrow, okay? I... I'm coming home. I'm gonna be fine. I promise, all right? Oh! Jesus! Never approach me if I'm not expecting you! Cheese and rice, what are you, an animal?! Okay, you know what? You said you would stay off my case, and where do I find you? Right here. Right here in front of Tatiana's apartment. What? I live here. Oh, okay, that's hilarious. Yeah, okay, you know what's not funny? That you stole a confidential FBI case file. Oh, that's funny, I don't remember any of that. I'm gonna say this one more time. Stand down, Officer. Fuck off, Officer. Oh, okay, guess what? Now you've really done it. I'm gonna call my boss. Yeah, you do that, tattle tits! Fucking narc! Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Hale. It's Ashburn, sir. I'm gonna need authorization to suspend a police officer from my investigation, sir. Ashburn, why is working with local authorities a problem for you? Sir, it's not. I understand how this might sound coming from me, but I... I think this individual might actually be mentally unstable. According to her captain, she grew up on those streets and she knows them better than anyone. That seems like an asset to our investigation. Nonono. Sir, I... Just work with her. Just show me you can do this or forget the promotion. Well, sir, no need, no need to take someone's badge. I think I can, uh... I think I can work something out, sir. All right. Thank you. Byebye. You know, uh... I just, I think just... I think you and I got off on the wrong foot. Oh. I don't know Boston, and you obviously have a a lot of resources and a lot of knowledge about the area thatthat could be, you know, could be useful. Probably very. So, uh, maybe we can work together on this. Yeah, I don't need your help to take down Larkin. You know, you wouldn't even have known about Larkin if it wasn't for me, so obviously the FBI can get information that you can't, okay? And there's a lot more where that comes from... a lot. Maybe I just need to hear a little "I need your help, Mullins. " No, I won't be doing that. Okay, well, get your ass back in your car. Okay, this is ridiculous, okay? I'm an FBI agent, you're a police officer. It's not... "I need your help, Mullins. " I need your help, Mullins. Oh, God, what is... is this a whisper party? I want that third floor to hear it. "I need your help, Mullins. " And then maybe give me a little echo on that "Mullins. " I need your help, Mullins! Mullins, Mullins... Just move, move, move! God. Even in that, you're annoying. I will work with you, as long as we're clear that this is my case. That's actually not correct. This isn't your... Awesome. Glad you see it my way. Careful of the car. Goddamn it. Stand down. I got it. If you just, if you just let go. I got it. I think I have it, just... I got it. Just let me... I got it. Geez. Oh, shit. Ma'am, you, uh... Just go. Just go. Okay, now let me take the lead on this. I'm a trained interviewer. "Interviewer"? What are you, fucking Barbara Walters? I just thought we were gonna go in there and bring in some heat on her. I'm sorry, w what is... what does that even mean? What does that mean? Me and you, we're the heat. We go in there, we interrogate her, we scare the shit out of her... See, we don't say "interrogation. " It's, it's much too aggressive. Rule number one: catch more with sugar than a stick. That's a horrible fucking saying. Okay, well, what we like to do isis create aa genuine personal interest in the subject, allowing them to open up. But from then, I'm going to... Oh, God. ... uh, perform instant personality assessments based on the MyersBriggs theory, uh, Thematic Apperception Tests, and a few... well, a few others I won't, I won't bore you with. Oh, my God, well, that's... I am balls deep in boredom. All right, as long as you don't do that whole goddamn long explanation again, we'll try it your way first. Okay. Only 'cause you're older. Oh, my God. Tatiana Krumova. I'm Special Agent Sarah Ashburn, and this is Detective Mullins. Detective Mullins. Detective Mullins. And we'd like to ask you a few questions, if you could give us a moment. Oh, shoot, you know, now is bad. Oh. I'm making butter. Oh. Oh, that's... How about other time? Well, if you could... How about right fucking now? How's that? How's that? Right fucking now. Well, Tatiana, thank you. This is, this is very kind of you. So... how long have you lived here? I've lived here since I moved in. Shit. Okay, that's very, very helpful. Okay, we'll get a little more specific. Uh, what do you do for a living? I know what this asshole does for a living. What you know, asshole? Okay, sugar, no stick. It is Bulgarian, is it not? No, I'm fucking French. Oh, Jesus. Tatiana... I don't understand what you're saying. Nice bullshit Bulgarian. Okay, you know what? That was perfect Bulgarian. I mean, I don't understand what you're talking about. Why I go to jail when I don't do shits? Ah, okay. So she did understand what I was saying, she just didn't understand the context in which I said it to her. Oh, sweet God. Okay, okay, all right, Rosetta Stone, you're done. God. Oh, Jesus. How many porns have been made on this couch? Oh, this couch not of your satisfaction? You're not comfy? I'll get comfy. When my foot's up your ass. Wow. That'll make me really comfy. Stop. Don't poke me. Don't poke me. Listen, Tatiana, I want to get really real. You ready to get real, Tatiana? Let's get real. Okay, we both know you've been blowing shit up your nose all day. Man, I get it. There's nothing more I'd love to do than slip into my camisole, put my feet up, have a little smack. Real good time, maybe a couple cold ones, a little chip and dip, watch some cartoons. I'd get a big bowl of fucking coke, I'd just put my face right in it, cut it with a little Ritalin. Heaven on fucking earth, right? Sure. I'd camp out all week for tickets to that show. WhWhatwhat is this, Training Day? All fucking week, I'd camp out for that. But you, you piece of shit, you've been rolling deep for a long time, and now it's time you open up that goddamn mouth and tell us what we want to know. You got good point. I tell you what. I open my mouth. You get the fuck out my house now! How's that for open mouth? Fuck out! Get fuck out! Yeah. I'll get the fuck out. All right. You should really stop smoking, 'cause, uh... it's an awfully bad habit. You're leaving half your lipstick in the ashtray. I had a, uh, great aunt that lost most of her teeth to, uh, smoking. Good to know. A lot of fistfights, too, but, uh, mostly smoking. You know what? We're gonna get out of your hair. So we're just gonna... What? That is not front door. Put your hands where I can fucking see them! Don't fucking move. What is this, your drug mule?! Oh, my gosh. Oh, my goodness. That's my mother! Huh? Do you have balloons of horse up your ass?! You break my fucking door! Stand down, Officer. Stand down, Officer. Who closes the door to take a shit?! Get out! Humans do. Get out now. You get out. D Don't touch underpants! Thank you.
