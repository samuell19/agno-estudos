Security! Where is the security guard? - I don't know, sir. Security! Sir.. Sir.. Whose car is this? Whose car is this? Whose car is this? I don't know, sir. I went out for breakfast.. - You went out for breakfast! Yes, sir. Do you know where my office is? Yes, sir. Do you know my secretary? Yes, sir. - Do this.. Go to her and give her your resignation. Is that understood? I don't want to see your face from tomorrow! Everyone, get back to work. Our boss is here! I have to use the restroom.. Hold it, he's in a bad mood. - I really have to go. Happy anniversary, sir! Fire the security guard. He is good-for-nothing. Edward.. But why? Vani, do you have any other work? Because I have a lot of work to do. Sir, today is your anniversary. So, I was thinking if I should buy some gifts for Ms. Mamta. Mamta has me. That's her best present. On your way out, shut the door. Oh, no! I am so sorry! I mean.. - It's okay. No! - It's okay! No! - Sid, it's okay! It's ruined. I will get another one. - But it's just a cake, Sid. Don't be silly. Come on, let's cut the cake. Come, let's cut it. Ready? - Yes. - Okay.. "Happy anniversary to us.." "Happy anniversary to us.." Come.. Here you go. Small piece.. Wow! This is amazing. You should open a bakery, you know? - But I didn't make it. I bought it. Still, it is also a talent to select the right cake. You know, you should never underestimate yourself. You are very good at wooing women. That reminds me of something. Very good. My beloved.. The love of my life.. For God's sake, please stop it! Come on, that sounds so cheesy! No, please.. - Come on, no.. No, please don't say that! I have worked hard for this. Please.. - Okay. Please, allow me to do so. - Okay.. All yours.. My beloved.. The love of my life, my sweetheart.. - Wow! If I have your permission I'd like to present this to you. Sid, this watch! How do you know about this watch? You have been looking at this watch online since two months. It's time for you to wear it. Thank you. But I didn't get anything for you.. Oh, come on, please don't start with all this. Please! This watch.. Just like this watch.. You are my prized possession. And I can't stay away from you even for a minute. I swear. What about the eight hours that you spend at work away from me? Excluding the eight hours. - Right. Yes, please.. - Okay. Okay.. Now, go and get changed. I can smell the odour of your sweat. - Hey.. Mamta! - Yes? I need to ask you a question. - Yes, go ahead. Well, our anniversary is today.. - Yes. Then why are we hosting the party tomorrow? Good question. Because, Siddharth.. - Yes? Today, you are only mine. - Wow! And I don't want to share you with anyone tonight. Actually, you are very good at wooing men. I have wooed one man, mission accomplished. Now, go! Hey, listen! Where are you? - I am coming. Sorry! Sorry.. - Bless you. Look! The husband is going to kill his wife for the sake of his girlfriend. He will get caught. He will never get caught if he is careful. Really? - Yes. Okay, now let's watch. Come. You know, before I met you I never believed some people are meant to be together. Now, I totally believe it. Just watch the movie. You'll miss the action. Why don't we do some other kind of action? No! No? - No, I mean.. No, I mean.. Simona. - Yes? No, are you serious? Don't I look serious? I.. - Come on, now. Do you want some action? - Yes. Don't you want to? Today, I am definitely going to be late. After a late night show on a weekday it's hard to wake up early on the following day. Well, listen. - Yes? Before I forget. The party is at 8 p.m. Don't forget. Should I get something? - Yes. Bring yourself. Hey, by the way did you see my new watch? Oh, wow! Who gave it to you? The best husband in the world. Update me. Sir, I took your car and reached home on time, for your anniversary. I didn't let your wife feel your absence. I was affectionate towards her, spoke in a loving manner gave her a gift and ate the cake. Did you give her a gift? Who asked you to give her a gift? People do give gifts on an anniversary, sir. The chapter on marriage in The Robot Guide to Human Relations says this. Listen, I don't care about what your guide says. Why did you spend my money without my permission? Sir, your data says, your house, money, car business and everything belongs to your wife, Mamta. Hey! Shut up! You are here to fool everyone else, not me. Is that clear? I'm sorry, sir. Hereafter, I'll ask your permission before spending your money. Okay. You better do. You have a cold. I will have to copy this as well. Can you sneeze as well? From the odour of sweat to the symptoms of every disease.. Everything can be copied. How? There's an application on your phone. Open the application and press 'simulate'. This contains general information. How will it copy the kind of infection I have from a particular virus? Sir, please choose the 'manual' option. Manual. Okay. Excuse me. All right, go inside now. - Yes, sir. Sir! Rohan Saxena is waiting for you, in your cabin. Rohan? - Yes, sir. Just get me a box of tissues, fast! Yes, sir. Rohan! - Hello, sir. What brings you here? Sir, is everything all right? - Of course. Why won't it be? - Can I? I got an alert that there's been a manual operation. So.. Sir. Close the door and don't let anyone inside my cabin. Yes, sir. Yes. Well, I got an alert for manual operation.. Yes, I did it. As you can see, I have a cold. Oh, then it's okay. In that case there are a few standard checks. Will your give your left thumb print, please? Why? To verify if you are Sid. Actually, the clones we make are almost identical and it's hard to differentiate between the robot and the human. Whenever there's a manual simulation we have to double-check. Why the left thumb impression? That's enough. Every robot's left thumb is purposely left blank. No fingerprints. Okay, sir. Listen. My cold is getting worse. Sir, the health monitor in your watch is giving me all the information. As your cold gets worse, so will mine. You're gone if it doesn't. Is that clear? Here you go. This is paracetamol! What do you mean? I am allergic to paracetamol! Why didn't you get it by yourself? Sid! Sid! Sid! Sid! Hey! What's wrong? Sid.. You have fever. Listen, should we cancel the party? - No.. I will be fine. I have brought medication. I will be fine after taking it. Sid, this is paracetamol. - So what? Are you crazy? You are allergic to paracetamol. Wait, I will get another medicine. You are watching television all the time. There are things that are more interesting. Do you want to see? I am not in a mood. I have a bad cold and am hungry. Do you want me to cook something? Yes. So that my stomach also gets upset along with this cold. Never mind, let's order from outside. I can make soup. - Please forget about it. Why? Only Mamta knows how to make the kind of soup I prefer. Then go and stay with her. Why do you come to me? Hey.. Please don't start this now! So annoying! Here you go. If you don't feel better, we shall cancel the party and go to the doctor. Okay? - Okay. Thank you. I am fine.. Hey, Jeet! Stop! Stop it! Jeet, what're you doing.. - Jeet, stop cheating! I am not cheating. - I saw it. Did you see that? Mamta! Mamta, see.. If Sid says so, you must have cheated. Did you see that? - You are caught. I mean, love is truly blind. What! - Right! What do you mean? I didn't cheat, and yet, you think I did. Sid has been scamming your company for years now and you can't see that. What rubbish! How is that related to this game? Rubbish? Why don't you ask him? Sid, tell her. Sid and I are married. The company doesn't belong to me. It belongs to Sid and me. It's ours. Whatever is mine is his as well. It's your company, your money.. You can do whatever you want! Yes, Jeet. This is our house. And you're not welcome here anymore. I am sorry, guys. Mamta! Did she do that for me? Did she really say that about me? Sir, the cameras in my eyes had recorded everything. If you want, I can play it on television. Interesting. I didn't know that Mamta still feels the same way for me. I was fed up of her nagging. Sometimes, I wanted to.. Then I thought, you're a better option. Sid! Where are you? Oh, no! Why didn't you tell me she was home? Sir, you came suddenly, so.. I will go and see.. - No! Stay here. Come on, take off your t-shirt. Since she is trusting me I have to go to her. Take this, and go inside. Go on. - Okay. Hey, thank God! Tell me. Which one? Which one do you like? This one, or the other? Sid.. Sid! Sid, I am getting late.. Sid.. Sid.. Sid, come on. Sid.. Sid.. Sid! Wow! We should go to a place like this for a holiday. Let's go then. How can we plan right now? - Why? I can't afford it at this moment. It's okay. I can pay for it. You never let go of any occasion to make me realise that I am financially dependent on you. When did I say that? - But that's what you meant. Now I know why you said all that in front of your friends last night. And why is that? - You wanted to exhibit that you are a big-hearted person and I am so petty in front of you. Right? It's better to partner with a machine like you than to have a wife like this. - That can't happen, sir. Neither can you become a machine, nor can I turn into a human. Is it necessary for you to talk sense every time? Is it written in your robot guide? - Yes, sir. My robot guide is.. - Shut up! Just shut up! To hell with your robot guide! I don't want anybody. Neither you, nor Mamta. And specifically, I don't need that wisdom from you. Don't you need Mamta? There's an old-fashioned way to get rid of one's wife. That would've worked better than you. Hello. - 'Hello.' Rohan. - 'Yes, sir?' Rohan, I want to meet you. I want to put an end to this robot contract. Yes. Get inside. Just go! Actually, he left the office just now. Can I take.. No.. Hold on.. Sir, Rohan Saxena is on the phone. Shall I transfer the call to your cabin? Yes, please. Sir, your shirt.. Oh, right.. I spilled some coffee on it. So, I changed it. I always keep a spare shirt in my car. By the way, Vani, I like it. Sir? You take care of all my things. Thank you. Yes, Rohan? - 'Hello, sir.' 'You asked me to come down for a meeting.' Y-Yes, I do remember but I'll be busy for a few days. We'll meet after a few days. Okay? 'Okay, sir. Whenever you're free.' 'Thank you, sir.' - Sure. Thank you, Rohan. - 'Bye, sir.' Sir, Edward is here. He wanted to meet you. I told him that you can't meet him, but still.. No, please. Bring him in. Sir.. I made a mistake, sir. Please forgive me. Sir, you had fired him. Yes.. - Sir, I'll never repeat it. Please. You don't have to do this. Please. Resume his services. And, give him a hike of 25 per cent. Okay, sir. Thank you. - Please.. - Thank you. Well, why just Edward? Give a 25 per cent hike to the entire staff. Sir? Yes, why not? Thank you, sir. - You're most welcome. I'll just tell them. - Sure. 'Sid, are you still in the office?' 'I have been waiting for you.' I am sorry, I am leaving right now. 'Please come soon.' Yes, I'll be there soon. Hey, you reached so fast. What was so urgent that you called me from the office? Sid.. Sid, I am very upset. And I am very confused. - What's the confusion? You'll have to make a choice. Would you choose to be with Mamta or me? Sid. - Are you serious? Of course I am. - No, I mean, are you really serious? Did you call me here to discuss this? Yes, Sid, because it's important. We've discussed this numerous times. Then why can't you make a choice? What do you want to know? - Would you choose to be with Mamta or me? Is this a pattern in every woman? Do you have to bring up the same topic every 15 days? Do you want to hear the truth? Then listen. I am not a fool, okay? I can't leave my wife only to marry another. Let things be the way they are. And if it doesn't suit you, then leave me. And help me get rid of this relationship. I'll be well off without you two. Okay? Is there anything else which is very urgent for you to talk on? No? Thanks. Sir.. Excuse me, sir. Everyone keeps chattering around. I can't even sit peacefully for a while. Hey! What the.. Hey! Who did this? Are you dumb? I asked you, who did this? Who broke the windshield of my car? What's wrong with you? Are you even blind? Why do you work here? I'll get you fired from this job. Just wait and watch. - Excuse me, sir. You broke it by yourself. And now, you are trying to put the blame on me? Let me see how you get me fired. Did you say I did this? - Yes. Are you saying I have smashed my own car? - Yes. Rascal, did I do this to my car? - Sir, leave me. - Sid.. You come drunk and lie! - You did. - Leave him. Leave him. - I'll hit you. - Go. I am so sorry. He gets drunk at work and blames me. - Please. Go. What's wrong with you? Please. Look at the way he's talking to me! Sid.. - Just look at the way he's talking to me. - Please calm down. Sid, this is my society. I stay here. - Fine. Cheers! Cheers to Mr. Sid. One shot, come on.. - Cheers! Who's going to start fast? - Cheers! - Cheers.. Cheers. - What's happening here? - Sir.. What's happening here? Vani! Vani! Vani! What the hell is happening here? Sir, everybody is celebrating the increment that you announced. What? - Yes, sir. Have you lost your mind? Increment.. What's wrong with everyone today? Sir.. Now, what is he doing here? You asked him to resume duty a few minutes ago. Did I? - Yes, sir. - Have you.. Come with me. Did I come here? Yes. - Are you very sure? Yes, sir. But you were wearing a blue shirt. Leave. I know what you are up to. I brought you as my copy but now you are plotting against me. Well, you're right on your part. When I have deceived everyone with my personality how can I expect you to follow my instructions? What you did with Mamta was wrong. That's my personal matter. Who are you to interfere in that? You are wrong on your part. Whatever you are doing with Simona.. Just shut up! Now, will you show me the right way? And what do you know about her? What do you know? She's far better than Mamta. At least she never boasts about her money. You don't deserve Mamta. How dare you! How dare you talk to me like that! Have you forgotten that you're just a toy that I bought? I can play or throw you away according to my need. Got it? I have been created exactly like you. Our tissues, bones, hair, skin.. Everything is identical. Everything has been copied but they couldn't copy the filth of your heart. Heart? Do you have one? So, you have a heart, and you've lost it to Mamta. Have you started to love her? Just wait. And watch me crush your heart. I'll take care of Mamta later. Hello. 'Hello, sir.' Hello, Rohan. - 'Yes, sir.' Come and meet me. I need to talk to you. Sir, I was coming to meet you but you asked me to come after a few days. Rohan, I.. Yes, Rohan. I am really sorry. It skipped my mind. 'Shall I come tomorrow, sir?' Yes, please come tomorrow. Thank you. 'Okay, sir.' Congratulations, sir! You own your copy permanently now. Thank you, Rohan. Thank you. Actually, you see, I am getting used to him. Yes, I can understand. That's your copy. Thank you. But, Rohan, I wanted to tell you something. Well.. - Yes, sure. This whole matter is strictly.. It's confidential, sir. The entire procedure is confidential. Every client of ours is exclusive. We keep their information to us. Whatever you do.. Whatever you intend your copy to do.. No one will get to know about it. Good.. Thank you, sir. - Good. Sir, one more thing. You'll have to confirm your identity in order to upgrade your status from temporary to permanent. Just a second, sir. Here you go. No, sir, the left one. Oh, yes.. Yes. Here, right? - Yes, sir. It's done, sir. Done. It's done, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much, Rohan! - Welcome. - Thank you. What's the matter? Come inside. What? You asked me to choose between Mamta and you, right? Yes. These are the keys to your house. Go to hell. Hello, Mamta. Yes? Would you like to go for a movie? With whom? There's a good-looking guy by the name of Siddharth. Okay. But my husband shouldn't come to know about it. Okay. Update. I stayed with your husband. He didn't get a hint. Now he has planned to go on a holiday with you. Holiday? With Sid? I can't even stand that freeloader for a second. Anyway, what did you say? You asked me to be a good wife. So, I said yes to him. You agreed? Without my consent? You are of no use. Really. Let me handle you first. And then I'll handle Sid. What did you mean by that? Hello. Rohan. - 'Yes, ma'am.' I need to meet you, and it's urgent. I want to cancel the contract. Wow! You're looking gorgeous. Thank you. Are you going somewhere tonight? Yes, I am going for a movie. Oh, with whom? With a guy named Siddharth. I am so sorry, I forgot to tell you that he won't be able to come. So, you'll have to manage with me. Sorry. Okay, I'll manage. You'll manage? - Yes, I'll manage. Really? - Don't worry. Okay. Let's go! She'll manage!
