Sweetheart? I'm here. How are you? I'm fine. - You? - Yeah. - What are you doing? - Finishing my speech. Hi. You're here? Yeah, why? I dunno... I didn't see your scooter. Did you loan it to someone? No. - Getting it repaired? - No. I sold it. - You what?! - I sold it. You sold your scooter? Why? Didn't you like it anymore? Yes. Were you afraid of it being stolen? No, it was for something else. What else? We have a plan. Who is this plan with? With friends... girlfriends too. Can we hear what it is? Yes it's... It's... Do you want to go somewhere? Maybe that too. Is this a gift for a friend? No. Yes, it is for a trip, actually. Basically, we put money in and we sell things. You sell things? What are you selling? Guillaume sold a painting, I think. Guillaume sold a painting? What did he sell? I don't really know. I think it was some old black thing. With a naked woman and an old man running. He sold his scooter, too. Others have sold furniture and things. We've almost all the money we need, already, so it's good. Did you sell things from here? Yes, stuff that was useless. Like what? Things lying around... old clothes. Old clothes? You didn't sell things of mine? -No. Well... just a few... A few what? In your closet... old stuff. Dresses... Joseph, are you kidding? - No, I'm not kidding. - Yes, he's laughing. Joseph, are you kidding? Come here, Joe. It's a joke, sweetheart. Hold on, where's my Dior dress? - What Dior dress? - My Dior dress is gone. My vintage stuff? - Where's the Dior dress? - Did you sell it? You never wore it. Is this a joke? Where are Mum's things? - Darling... - What? - My leather jacket! - Where is her leather jacket? -Joseph, you didn't sell it? Joseph, we're asking you a question! You didn't sell the vintage stuff, the Dior dress... ...and Mum's leather jacket? And my shoes! And my boots too! Just 2 pairs. The others were too worn. - You're crazy! - Is this a joke? You didn't touch my things Joseph? No, just your suede shoes and your green jacket. - What green jacket? - And then... And then what? Your... Not my watches? You have one left. It's the same time everywhere. Joseph, am I dreaming? You didn't touch my watches!? Joseph, what's this?! There is only one watch, where are the others? Where are the watches? Who did you sell them to? Buyers on the Internet. You're totally sick! These are collector's watches! Do you know how much they cost? What else did you sell? Cufflinks. What cufflinks? You never wear them. Joseph, come here. There was more than one pair. Wait, Joseph... where's my pearl necklace? Did you take my pearl necklace? Did you sell it? We all sold things to make a common pot. We have to pay for the trip! The trip to go where? What's this all about? You took my pearl necklace... and did you sell it? Yes Mum. To do what? Eh, Joseph? I sold 2 earrings, the silver salt shaker... a little painting... Chinese stuff, a sugar bowl, an inkwell, candlesticks. Useless stuff! How would you know? It's been sold for 4 months and you didn't even notice. Same for books. What books? Joseph. Not your grandfather's books? Not many. How many? -A dozen, maybe 15. -Which? The oldest... nobody read them. They were all in Latin. You can't even read Latin! Joseph. Fucking hell! Oh no, Joseph! The original Montaigne! It's Kircher's! You're insane, Joseph! What does it matter? You don't realise... It was Grandpa's life's work! They weren't worth much. They were very valuable! You were robbed! Rare books! What else did you sell? Nothing. Yes, stuff in the basement. What, in the basement? Dirty candlesticks, an old chandelier... What candlesticks? - And then some wine... - What? - A few bottles. - Oh dear! - In the basement? What bottles of wine? They were the ones who chose. - Who are "they"? - The wine merchants. - Holy shit! Am I going insane, or what? This is a nightmare! Keep calm! Wait for me! How many bottles did you sell? I don't know, about twenty, maybe more. They took the dusty ones. The oldest that were never drunk. Oh, fuck... - They took the best. - Which ones? The ports from Francois. As if they knew about them. And the cognacs too. So now, you give me their number. You give me their number and I'll find them. - No. - Why not? It's nicknames. To avoid GAFAM fees. - What? He's driving me crazy. - Hold on. Did your friends do the same things at home? Yes. How much have you got? - 850. - Insane! Yes, I swear. It's increasing every day. Some comes from the provinces, other countries. To do what? It seems like I need to tell you. We decided to go there. - To go where? - To Africa, first. To Africa? - With the school? - No, just us. - Who is "us"? - The Delegation. The Delegation? - You're in The Delegation? - Yeah. Where are you going in Africa? Morocco? No, further down, in the Sahara. Where in the Sahara? We'll go to Niger, Chad and Sudan. No wait... - Why the Sahara? - This is where you have to start. - Start what? - The works. Am I stupid or what? What sort of works? To save the planet, Dad. You have plenty of chocolate. You want to save the planet? We've been thinking about it for more than 2 years. That's good, and at least you're not the only ones. I know... I hope so. And you know how to save the planet? We searched everywhere for months... The African section had the right idea. Since then, we've all agreed. What's this idea? I won't tell you. Why not? We swore to keep it secret. It's the only way. If it's the only solution, we'd like to know it. You know it will probably die? What will? The planet. It's too hot, and heaps of species disappear every day. Bees, insects, earthworms, poppies. And soon our own species. Have you heard about it? - Yes. - It's talked about. Soon, we won't be able to breathe. They've been saying that for 50 years... And nothing's been done? What can we do? Well this, first... Old people like you don't care. No way! You think... "It won't happen now... "We've time to enjoy it." You do! No, we don't think that at all. Do you think about what will become of me... ...when there's only carbon dioxide left? No. You never thought about me. I worry. I anguish about it. I want to have children with a future. I want to be a good dad. - I'm no longer a baby, it's okay. - I know. Can you tell us... ...how you're going to get there? We're a charitable association. - Is that enough? - They say it is. We have a clearance from the Foreign Office. Don't start lying. I'm not lying. We just need a manager over 18, to accompany us. Do you have one? Yes, it's Clothilde. Clothilde's not 18 years old. She's will be. We have a paper signed by the ministry. -A paper from which ministry? The Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We must act very quickly. Why do you have to go so fast? Soon we'll be like you. Meaning? In a rut, paralysed. It is at my age that we must act. Once you get there, what will you do? We'll see the heads of state, ministers, officials. Everything is already planned, in fact. - To do what? - Implement our plan. African children are with us. The idea comes from them. No one listens to children. They don't care. Now you tell us the idea. Otherwise I'll get angry. Stop it, you're being too impatient! What are you doing this evening? Well, nothing, why? Nothing in particular. If you like, I'll take you. - When? - Now. To Africa? - No, not that far. - Where? I'm not telling you. I'll blindfold you. Oh no! No! Is it for TV? Sorry? Is your game for TV? Not at all, Sir. - No, Sir, it's not a game. -What is it then? It's to save the planet. OK, fine. How will you do that? We're going to make a big sea in Africa. It will be in the Sahara. In several countries, with lakes all around. I will be huge! -Ah OK. Wow! How are you going to do it? By pumping water from the ocean... ...or digging? By pumping. Yes, of course... Pumping is best. You agree, do you? Oh yes! Replace the desert with a sea or by lakes... I don't think it's dumb. We should have done it a long time ago. That part of Africa was all green once. Yes, that's right. I didn't know that. It's just water that's missing. Yes, just water. But... ...it would still need a lot, eh? Stop us right here, to the right. The woods are not very nice around here. I know, but it doesn't matter. Want me to pay? No, I'll pay. Wait, I'll open the door. Is it for a fancy dress party? Yes, a surprise party! - Okay, good evening. - Thanks. - Good evening, Sir. - Shall I wait for you? - No, we'll be here a long time. Tell me if the pumping works. I know a lot of people there. OK thank you. I should've worn other shoes. You could've told me. I'm not allowed. Are we taking off the blindfolds? Oh, fuck it! Okay... What's this thing here? What? Howls Okay, can we remove the blindfolds now? No, it's further. You can remove the blindfolds. -Where are we? What's the sea got to do with this? - It takes a long time to explain. All right, but tell us anyway. Yes, on the spot. How many of you are going? The number's growing every day. Some come from Spain, from Norway... ...even from Sweden. They're already on their way. And if we, the parents, say no? We'll leave anyway. You'll leave secretly? We'll leave. Here it is. Oh, Clothilde! Good evening, Madam, Sir... How are you? I'm fine. I'm okay thanks. We're finishing the model. Do you like it? Yes, it's really good. It's big, eh. Joh, did you explain to them how the water get there. In fact, it's coming.. ...either this way or this way ...or from the Mediterranean. ...where you are. Or over there, the Red Sea... ...or from the Atlantic. Or even there, with Cameroon. So how does the water come? It's pumped from the sea. It's simple, we need pipes... ...dams and pumps. Do you have the pumps? Yes, we have them. We contacted companies and we're comparing quotes. African pumping companies? No, not only. German... American too. We put them in competition. It's a very big job. So you have to think hundreds of millions. But who is going to pay to do this? All countries will pay for it, Sir. We all breathe the same air. You know the International Monetary Fund? They develop these types of projects. That's what they're for. Have you contacted them? Since the beginning of the project. It's awesome. Have you seen the Brazilians? They are razing the Amazon rainforest. -We will do the opposite. The opposite of Brazilians. We'll cover half of Africa with forest. The Prime Minister of Niger agrees. And Idriss Deby since yesterday. Who's Idriss Deby? The President of Chad. Oh yes, yes. Our system will offer a plus... a large evaporation surface. And more rain. That's it, exactly. There, all around the sea... ...we are going to set up factories to desalinate the water. -Who will build these factories? There are already 4 interested countries. We received a response from China. They are very interested. All this fresh water, what are you going to do with it? Are you going to start a river? -A river or two, but especially lakes. Rivers will join the Niger... ...or even Senegal. There, you see? - It can go fast. - Very quickly. 2, 3 years, no more. These rivers will give birth to cultures. Keep in mind... ...that there will be forests, rice paddies... ...palm groves, grass. And swamps as well... ...waterfalls, fruit will grow. Animals, like monkeys or tigers. - We haven't mentioned fishing. - Yes, fishing! We'll have fish, crustaceans... like shrimp. They'll feed lots of people. I nearly forgot... ...these movements will lower sea level. - But not by much. - Oh yes! - Not by much? - Yes, people have studied. The water would drop by 3 to 4 mm per year. In 10 years, that's 3 or 4 cm. Police! What's the matter? Hands on your head! What for? What's the matter? Joseph, come here! Police! Hands on head. Put your hands on your head. -What's the matter? - Are you armed? - No. - Do you have anything dangerous? - Your bag. - I have nothing. - She has nothing. What's all the fuss about? - Hands on head. - Your hands on your head. I'm calming down... I want to understand. Did you do this? - No. - We didn't do anything. - We were visiting. Why you are with kids? We're not doing anything... there's nothing bad going on. Do you come here regularly? Not at all. We're not regulars. Do you pick up kids? - We don't pick up kids! - Calm down. We came to see the children's project. Is it a network? A sect? No. No, it's their project to save the planet. So... It's weird. But it's a project to save the planet. You gotta be joking! - No! - Calm down. - I'm calm. - No! Hush! - Explain to them. - Can I explain to you? Lower your hands, explain to us. And the children, there? - So. - He's coming back. Not too far. Look, do you see all this? The shape in blue is Africa. It's Africa? Do you think so? I'm not convinced. If it's Africa... ...on the right is Senegal? That's it, exactly. Over there, it's Senegal. The names are written, by the kids... There is marked "Tunisia", it is Tunisia. - And Algeria? - It's here, Sir. - That's all. - It's Algeria. - The white stone... - That's Algiers. And behind me... - Don't go too far. - I'll stay here, Sir. - I'll show you. - Go ahead. This is Egypt... with Cairo and the Nile. We're going to the police station to explain. - Come on. - But Sir! Don't argue! You are adults with minors in the woods! - We explained to you. - It's absurd. No. We can travel to Central Africa. To Niger, into Sudan too. They're all cooperating. I told you from the beginning. It's a big project. - Quentin? - Yes. What time do they open at the FO? At the what? The Foreign Office. What's this shitty idea? I was discovered. Discovered how? Make something up! - What? - Have to find it. He sold more stuff... it was risky. So, who forced him? If you were in danger of being caught, you had to sell less. You weren't discreet enough! Discretion is essential. Don't talk to adults about it. - They're all fucking shit. -We're wasting time. - And the cops too! -I hadn't planned that the cops would show up. - It was your fault! - I didn't know. You're mad for telling your parents about it. Your father could do an article. -I know him, he wouldn't do that. They destroyed the map. It doesn't matter. The videos of the map are safe. Do you agree? We're not all going to argue. I'm voting he be expelled. - What? - No way. Yes, the Swedes expelled two members. Just for something on Instagram. This is much worse. You deserve it even more. You realise? OK, then, expel me. But we have to talk about it and cast a vote. Hold on, Joseph told me he was trapped. It was me who said that his parents could come. We'll expel you too, then. - What? - Yeah. You need me. We don't need you. You let yourself be influenced by your feelings. You saw how my mother protected us? Yeah, it's true. Alright, listen, The African Union meets in 10 days. 10 days. The embassy attaches will receive the documents. Trust me, everything's fine. The African Union meets in 10 days? You know, I thought about it... And if their project is really serious... - Yes? - You'll do what you want... ...but I won't let him go alone. I will go with him. You're kidding, aren't you? - What, am I kidding? - You can see it's sheer madness. Where's the madness coming from? What do you mean? The geographers, physicists who keep telling us disaster is approaching... Do they want to deceive us? We can't know. Well yes, they know. It's their job to know and let us know. What are you going to do? Will you go into the sand with a shovel, and dig? Want to save the planet? I can't do much for the planet... ...but I can help my son. Otherwise I'll never forgive myself. The Earth will not explode, it will not dry out tomorrow. Yes, don't make me pass for a moron. - Everybody talks about it. - Yes, it's the fashion. Tomorrow there'll be a catastrophe. Is that what you think? In any case, they believe in it. They're defending their world, not ours. Either way, you don't get it. I wonder if you're jealous. Jealous of whom? Of our son. Of his bravery. When I first met you... ...you had ideas, too. But with time, they fade away. Oh thank you. Don't mention it. Maybe it's normal. - Are you okay honey? - I'm tired. Come and sit down. Is your model in the woods stuffed? No, we have a plan B. What's that? It's secret. -Where is it? It's what? I'll tell you in 3 days. It's already left. What's left? It's left. That's all I can say. In the meantime, do you have homework? Leave him alone, he knows what he has to do. - Are you hungry, darling? - No. Do you want to rest a little? Are you aware? Aware of what? Joseph and Clothilde. What? That's it, they made love. What? Unbelievable. Yes, it's Clothilde who told me. That's not on... She's much older than him. Does that make it any worse? Damn it, but... Clothilde!? Men are always surprised that a woman wants a man. No, Joseph's not a man. Not yet, I agree Why did you put 6 plates out? For Audrey and Jerome. Audrey and Jerome? You forgot? Damn, I invited them for lunch! Damn it... what you told me. About Joseph? Well? Fucking made me feel old. Maybe you'd like to take his place? - Hi! - Good morning! Come in. How are you? - Are we too early? - No. Hi! You look good! How are you, darling? A bottle of wine? - How are you? - Yeah. - Hey! It's growing! - Yeah, did you see? You've grown up. It's going fast, eh! Well, I hope so. They're so pretty! Thanks! My parents know. Ah... good? Mine don't know. There are periods. In the middle Ages, it was super hot. Humanity doesn't set identify a problem that it can't resolve. My philosophy teacher said that. Don't forget kids. You don't worry that insects are disappearing? It's already happened. We do everything to get rid of insects. Will you regret the loss of mosquitoes and lice? No, but I still read that without bees, it's serious. I think there are interests behind it. Oh yes? What interests? New products coming out, it's commerce, liberalism. - Someone benefits from everything. - You surprise me! Even threat of climate change. If you face it, honestly... ...look at the kids,... they've never lived so well. We live longer... we're better cared for. Better protected. Even poverty is on the decline. Okay, but not everywhere. There are more urgent matters than the pack-ice. It melts in summer and freezes in winter. - It's a crisis. - Oh yes. Your philosophy teacher was right, of course... Humanity has always worked around it. What do you make of all the talk about a crisis, about survival... ...in the media, on TV? Everywhere. On the radio. Being in the media doesn't make it true. It is their stock in trade. It's blessed bread. Panic? They love it. Don't be so naive as to think it's the truth. Excuse me, I'm not naive. Those journalists who freak us out... ...and who benefit from it... that's what scares the kids. You surprise me. Excuse me, can I intervene? There is a solution, you know. Ah good? What is it? There are too many of us on Earth. It depends where. And so? I'll give you a solution. One in two adults must be eliminated. And... how do you do that? By drawing lots. Oh yes? And what then? Painless. There are methods to kill painlessly. Lucile, do you realise what are you saying? Is it your idea? We all talked about it together. It's good. You have thought about how many humans should be eliminated? Yes, between 2 and 3 billion. At 4 billion, we'd have a chance. Yeah! Who calculated that? Our specialists. Do you have specialists? - Yes. - Yes. So do we start with the old and weak. No. Old people will die anyway and not have more children. The most dangerous are young adults. It's good, children, nice project. Excuse me, but your diamond? Oh no! - Don't you have it anymore? - No, look. You don't have it? Only the mount remains, it's weird. Did you have it this morning? I dunno, I put the ring on without thinking. - I didn't check. - It doesn't come off on its own. Of course it doesn't come off on its own. Did you have it this morning? I don't know! I haven't checked... I put the ring on automatically. - You're getting on my nerves. - Don't yell at me. I had it at Ghislain and Manon's. Thursday... Hello? Wait... Can you put the news on? The news. What's happening? - I'll call you back. - Who is it? It's Christelle. I'll call you back. Gasoline vehicles, in Paris or in the big cities... ...must turn off the engine at least for an hour. Headline story for today A pollution alert for extra fine particles. Extra fine particles? They're the most dangerous. Particles of what? ...face masks... Old people should not go out. Turn off all electrical appliances. No smoking, no running. Avoid sudden movements and stay calm. You will be informed about raising the alert, without a doubt in the next few hours. We remain in special news edition. Dad, don't open the window! That's enough, Joseph! Calm down! Lucile, enough! The window! What a jerk! Go on, close the window, Jerome. Damned disturbing! Doesn't it only happen in Bangkok? - Very stressful! - It sucks, I'm pregnant. Jerome, I'm pregnant. No, we're going home. We have to go home. Yes, we're going home. Do you want a glass of water? Oh, God damn it! Call Dr Onodi. "Disturbing the doctor," you call it? I'm pregnant! - Audrey... - Call Dr Onodi. - I'll call him at home. - Lucile? - Dad, can I stay here? - I'm taking care of it. - You're sure? - Yes. - How nice. - No problem. Must find FFP2 masks. Everything is fine with those masks. You don't want to stay? Come on, let's go home. It's not the end of the world, it'll be OK. We're hitting the road. - Thank you so much. - It was nothing. - Hurry up! - I'm coming. Next time, at your place. - If we're still alive. - Come on. See you. Joseph and Lucile... come in here. What is it? Stop taking us for idiots. Has your mum's diamond been sold? - It was fake. - So what? Did your father give it to her? Yes. For their wedding anniversary. You don't say! Real or fake, what does it matter? - Come to my room? - All right. Joseph. - Yes. - Come here. Be careful with her. Yeah. - Hey! - Yes? - You promise me? - Yes! It's good, eh? We'll make a sea in the Sahara. And the kids will commit genocide. And we can no longer breathe in Paris. It's always better than here. What's better than here? Without me? I don't care,... take it any way you want. But you can keep your friends. Doesn't all that scare you? Yes, a little. Do you think that Joseph could eliminate us? It's by lottery. Maybe we can negotiate. Maybe. - Where are you going? - For fresh air. That's good. You chose your day well. Hey! What? You don't have to come home this evening. OK. You know, I think you love me more. Ezekiel's prophecy will be fulfilled, the signs are there. The sky will open up, He will descend to Earth. The Lord will be on his fiery horse. And we will be judged according to our actions. A few euros can save you... ...from the eternal flames. Because the Supreme Being, despite his anger... ...knows how to recognise charitable souls. - So, was it good? - Was what? Argh... with Clothilde. But... Who told you? She did. She called me right after. Was it good? OK. You told me that we would do it together for the 1st time. You forgot? Lucile, you're too young, it's normal. No, you were born in March, I was born in August. You know, at school,... ...there are plenty of boys in love with me. Well it's certain you won't have any trouble doing it. Yes, but it's... It's you that I love. I'm sorry. What did you do? It's none of your business. You know, with Clothilde... anyone can do it. You're being nasty. We don't have time to be jealous. You know very well that we may soon be dead. Where are you? Why don't you call me back? I've called 20 times. I get worried. Come on, call me back. Joseph, I can change my will. I'll leave you everything. We don't care about money. Didn't you understand? - I've already sold everything. - All right. Put that down, it's not for kids. OK? You shot me in the leg, you maniac! Go ahead, I can't do it. What is she going to say, Mum? What will she say? Oh fuck! Give me a cognac. You are not driving to go home? No, I'm not going home. - Problem with the boss? - Yes. In the end, we realise it's better to be silent. All day I listen to customers and their bullshit. At the sack at night, mum's the word. Do you have rooms? No, there's no bedroom. Okay. Oh fuck. It seems that deserts are gaining ground... ...over the entire surface the earth, for fuck sake! I can see it here. Fewer and fewer people. - Good night. - Good night. - Looking for something? - My father. Hi, sweetie. You have to come home. Mum is worried. How did you know I was here? You've been geolocated. In any case... ...she's beautiful. Cut it out! - She's pretty. - You're embarrassing. Can't I say she's beautiful? - Sorry. - Forget it, doesn't matter. Does it bother you that I say that? No, I don't mind. It's just that Joseph worried about you. We can go now. It's embarrassing, here, really. Please come. Let yourself go. You will be better at home than on the bench. He's right, come on! All right. The man says "let yourself go". - Quickly! - You grew up! Dad! Quickly! Joe, I'm going home, it's late. - You coming home? - Yeah. You're not sleeping here? No, really, it's late. Can I talk to you? Yeah. - Are you sure you won't stay to sleep? - Yes. I'd rather go home. It's dark outside. There are a lot of people. Sleep here. It's OK, don't worry. I wanted to tell you... See, we did it once... And was it good. But I prefer to leave it like that. Let it be cool between us. OK. We stay friends, eh? - OK? You understand? - Yes. Good. We keep in touch. Dad, I'm going to bed. Good night. Goodbye, Sir, I'm going. Hold on! But... Did you really make love with Jojo? Well actually, that's what he thinks. All right. Be careful going home. - Good bye, sir. - Hi. Here... it's water. Thanks. Something in you will always amaze me. What's that? I warn you, I'll be frank. Well, I'm ready. It's the fact... ...given the man you are... your fixed ideas... your conformity... your lack of empathy... your closure to the world, sometimes... your selfishness... your insistence that you're always right. Are there other things? Yes. But they're enough. What surprises you out of all of that? That I still love you. You're not the only one surprised. I'm going to bed. You coming? OK? - What are you doing? - Look here. I got trash bags of different colours. Sorting is easier. And I got the light-bulbs that consume less power. Good, eh? Hey, isn't that good? This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you come to us young people... ...for hope. How dare you?! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood... ...with your empty words. And yet, I am one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. And entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all that you talk about is the money... ...and fairy-tales of downturns to economic growth. How dare you?! Hi, how you going? I don't know. I've had no news. I'm worried. I was just walking around the neighbourhood. Walking my dog. - You have a dog! - Yes, I have a dog. He's so cute. Did you hear about the African Union? Yes, they told me. It's awesome. - They've left, haven't they? - Yes. In 10 years, you'll be able to swim in the sea. Otherwise, how are things with Clothilde? Well... It's not going very well. You sort of expected that, didn't you? Yeah, but I was just thinking about you... ...so it became impossible between her and me. - I've met someone. - Yeah? That's cool! It's great. Have you done it? Joseph, that's none of your business. Yeah. Well... do you think of me sometimes? Yes, but it makes me feel bad Could we ever get back together? Don't know... I'd have to think about it. OK. Tell me the truth. About what? This dog isn't yours... admit it. No, my aunt let me have him for the afternoon. Otherwise I had no excuse to come and see you. Come on, let's go for a walk. Yes. Can I sleep with you? Yes, come on. Like when you were a little baby. Come here, my little darling. What's up? Are you unhappy? Is it because of Clothilde? No. What is it then? They finally said no. - Who? - The new minister. No to what? To the trip for the inauguration. When was it planned? To be in 4 weeks. The new minister crossed out the name of the French.
