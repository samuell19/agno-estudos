What's wrong with this picture? Well, all these articles say we've been way too available. We need to be more coy. We are so coy, he barely knows we exist. OKAY: Ray pop quiz. Favorite song, favorite food, favorite drink? Go, go, go. Weezer's Island in the Sun, um, Dr. Pepper, oranges? - Very nice. - I'm trying to read. Fine, then the least you can do is read me the latest on boy-bagging technology. Oh, okay, this one is called "Fluff and Retreat." "Fluff his ego" then walk away. "Not only is he left wanting more, but he's under the impression that it's his idea." Nice. That's really cool. (WHISTLE BLOWING) Claire, do you realize that summer's almost over, and you haven't gone in the water once? Once would be way too many times. Mm. Excuse me. (SCOFFS) Do you realize we've got less than five days till you have to move? I don't want you moving halfway around the world. Claire, you're such a ruiner! (SCOFFS) I'd gone, like, a half hour without thinking about it. Hailey, I'm sorry, but... Besides, I haven't kissed Raymond yet. So I'm not going anywhere. GIRL: Whoo! Incoming. (GIRLS GIGGLING) Oh. Hello, hottie. It's Raymond. Hail, did you order a sand-witch? Cecilia's back from camp. Don't worry. He won't fall for yuck.

Wha-What was that? Fingers. That was fingers through the hair. I mean, technically, that wasn't shaking. Right? (HAILEY, CLAIRE GASP) Please, gods of love, no shake, no stretch, no flex, no... BOTH: No! You guys okay? - Yeah, we're fine, thanks. - Yeah, fine. - Thanks. - We're good. Baby-sit much? (GIRLS LAUGH) I can't take it anymore. As long as he doesn't flip his sunglasses up and down, we're fine. Hey, Ray, think fast! Oh! (CECILIA SCREAMS) -RAY: Yo -...I can't look anymore. You... CECILIA: Sorry!

We need your help! Hey. What? Oh, we've decided to fire Raymond. - What?! - What?! Mm. (BOTH SHOUTING) GRANDPA: You should've seen your faces! That is so not funny. Oh, you girls, you're too wound up. Help bring in the Last Splash decorations, please. Weatherman says a big storm's coming. We'll put them up again after it clears. Ray will still be there when you're done. - Grandpa! - (ALL LAUGHING) Supper's at 6:00, Claire. So you'll come back after dinner, right? - We can hang out in the rec room... - No, I have other plans.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hailey, you can unpack as much as you want. We're still moving. Yeah. (SIGHS) How was the club? And maybe I could get more than one syllable this time? - It was fine. - Mm-hmm. That was three. (SIGHS) I'm sorry, sweetheart, but... (STAMMERS) You didn't want to leave Boston, either, remember? And look what happened. You met Claire. You know, Australia could be another amazing adventure for us, Hails. So, how about we start packing your room? So how about I live here with Claire till I'm 18? How about, we go back to fewer syllables? Cool. That was one. REPORTER: A storm warning is in effect... HAILEY (GIGGLES): So that's where Cecilia Banks gets all the drama. Just look at her dad. BANKS: Well, as you can see... whoa! (LAUGHS) Hailey, how am I supposed to face eighth grade without you? My locker is right next to the boys' bathroom. And I have coed PE class by myself. We have to dance with Raymond at The Last Splash. We'll be such great dancers that he'll realize that he has to marry one of us. (CHUCKLES) And we'll be so happy that one of us got him, that we won't even be jealous, you know? Unless he picks you. That wouldn't be okay. (CHUCKLES) Joke. What if this is our last movie campout?

No, Mr. B.! - No! No, no, no, no, no, Mr. B! You can't... I'm sorry, but you can't do that! Mr. B., me and Claire have been planning for this for, like, ever. GRANDPA: It'll be all right. Grandpa, are the pool lights still on? (SCREAMING) Claire! (WOMAN HUMMING EERILY) (MUFFLED SCREAMS) (SCREAMING) Hold on, you're okay. There's a shark in the pool! You're okay, you're okay. Shh. I got you. Here, somebody get the chair! - (COUGHING) - Calm down. - There you go. - Here. She may be in shock. Take a deep breath. Claire, are you all right? She gets scared in the water. - Her parents drowned. - (COUGHING) GRANDPA: You all right, honey? I saw something. It's in there, and I don't know what it was! (COUGHING) Half the ocean washed up in there last night. Hailey, take Claire inside. Leonard, lock up the patio. I don't want anyone else falling in. LEONARD: Okay, clean it, lock it. Got it. That was, that was tight, Ray. Thanks, Ray. - Whoa... - Come on! - Hey! - Oh, my God... Raymond totally jumped in there to save you, with his actual biceps. Did you feel them around you? Were they flexed? Oh, God, they must've been flexed. If you had stopped breathing! You were, like, this close to mouth-to-mouth. There's something in there. I'm serious! It looked like... I can't even say it, but I swear, it just stared at me with its eyes! You're in shock... from touching Raymond! Hailey, I know what I saw. Fine, then we'll just go back when no one is looking, and we'll check it out. No way, Hail. I didn't mean to get in the water in the first place, and I'm not going back there again. Something bad could've happened. Come on, Clairedy cat. Put on your big girl pants and meet me at 9:00. (WHISPERS) Be careful! Grandpa'll be super mad at us. (GASPS) It's Leonard. Come on. Hey, maybe we should get fishing poles out or something. Shh, shh, shh. No. I don't want to catch it. I want to feed it. Fish sticks? Maybe it was an octopus. (SIGHS) With blue hair? And a tail? It could've been blue seaweed or kelp. It was not an octopus, and it wasn't kelp! - You want one? - I saw hair! God! Listen, if you're gonna ignore every single word I say, - I can hang out alone. - I'm not ignoring you. (BOTH TALKING AT ONCE) YOUNG WOMAN: I bet I know what it was. (GIRLS GASP) I'm guessing... it was a mermaid. Mm... mm... (GIRLS GASPING) (BOTH WHIMPERING) Boo. (SCREAMING) (MUFFLED GASP) (GIGGLES) (GASPS) It's a... Uh, you're a... (GASPS) - A m... - (EXASPERATED GROAN) I can see we have to take this slowly. Mer... maid. Mermaid. (WHIMPERING) Wha...? Fabled marine creature, half woman, half fish, best known for sitting on rocks, staring into mirrors, and obsessively combing our long, beautiful hair. Blah, blah, blah... (BURBLING) Wha... What is going on? (SCREAMING) Stop shrieking like a couple of gulls. For shrimps, you're awfully loud. (AQUAMARINE CHUCKLES) You speak English? Yeah. Mermaids speak every language known to man, fish, crustacean... and several varieties of sea fowl. What can you speak? I got a C in Spanish. Hmm. (GASPS) Wait. What if she's, like, bad or something? (WHISPERING) Why would she be bad? She's a fictional sea creature. They could be bad. We are not fictional! We're discreet. Hm. I've never been this close to a human before. (NERVOUS CHUCKLE) Yeah. Must be weird for you. What? Nothing. You're staring at my tail. Well, yeah, I was. Do you, want to touch it? Okay. Aah, it's slimy! (CHUCKLES) Thank you. I rub it with kelp and jellyfish twice a day. Hm. (MAJESTIC ORCHESTRAL THEME PLAYS) Wow! (SCREAMING) Please don't eat us! The thought! It's okay. I just want to see what feet feel like. CLAIRE: Give it! Can you pick things up with them? No, but... I can kick with them if you don't let go! Hey, get back here. (LOW RUMBLING) Mm! How-how did you do that? Oh, that's nothing. You should see my father. He can make some serious waves. Like last night, for example. Your dad made those waves? Yeah. He's mad at me, because I swam away from home three days before I'm supposed to get married off to this merman who's about as deep as a tidal pool. LEONARD: Hey! (GASPS) Leonard! We have to go. - He's a total psycho. - You have to hide. Wait! Where are you going? - We'll be back tomorrow morning. - Promise? Promise! Someone over there? - Run! - Don't get seen. (GASPS) (SIGHS) (WHISPERS) Hailey. - Hailey, wake up. - (MOANS) (BOTH LAUGHING) (DISTANT WHIRRING) What in the world? - Oh, no. - Oh! (BOTH GASP) - This is bad. - Oh, my God. This is so bad. Come on. (MACHINE WHIRRING) (WHIRRING STOPS) What have you done?! I drained the pool. HAILEY: She's not in there. - But how could she just get out? - I don't know. (CLATTERING) Come on. (SCREAMING) - (GIGGLING) - Oh, it's you. You scared the salt out of me. I thought you were that man with that awful sucking machine. I just about got turned inside out. How did you get in here? I used these. Whoa. (YELPS) (GIGGLES) My very own pair. Oh, and check this out. BOTH: Whoa. Wow. Isn't it cute? - (LAUGHS) - Very cute. And I can sit on it. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Hey, we've got to get you out of here. Come on. - You're going to get seen. - You need to give her your T-shirt. No. My bathing suit is like boy repellent. What if we see Raymond? It's your bathing suit or her birthday suit. Come on. (GIGGLING) (BANGING, YELP) (BANGING) Oh, no. That's not what you do. - You have to... - No. - Put your arms through them. - Put your arms through the... - You know what I mean? - No No, no. Oh. Wow. That looks amazing. I know. (GIGGLING, BOUNCING SOUNDS) Woo! I don't understand how you can sleep on these when they're so jumpy. I could just do this all day. GRANDMA: Claire, what on earth are you doing up there? You really need to stop. Gram's gonna be really mad at us. Woo! We're gonna get in huge trouble. You worry too much. I rest my case. This is so much fun. Woo! Oh! I love legs. So... Do you get to keep them? Technically, we can only have legs when the sun's out. And we have to keep them dry, or at least that's what I've heard. I've never had the guts to come out and try them. So this is your first time ashore? First time on land, first time with legs. Can you believe it? Oh, you'd never know. But I've got to be careful. Add moonlight or water, instant tail. Look what I can do. Eh! (LAUGHS) Ow. Stop that. (MUFFLED RINGING) - Hmm? - Hmm? (MUFFLED RINGING) (GROANS) Oh! Crabs! They found me. With a shell? Mm-hmm. Did you know you can hear the ocean through these? Yeah, but... Well, it works both ways. The ocean can hear you, too. Hello? Dad? DAD (OVER PHONE): Aquamarine! Just what do you think you're doing?! - Daddy? - Shell phone. (GURGLED YELLING CONTINUES) Could you give me a minute? Sure. Sorry. AQUAMARINE: Well, that's your plan, - not mine. - Okay. I don't want to marry some spoiled, rich, squid! (GURGLED YELLING ON PHONE) Well, you can make all the storms you want, but I'm not coming back. (THUNDER CRASHING) (GURGLED YELLING) No! No! Love is not a myth, Daddy, it's real! You think her dad is doing this? ...three days, I'll prove it to you. Well, if I'm wrong, then I will honor your plans. And I'll call you every night, okay? So calm down! (FRUSTRATED GROAN) (AQUAMARINE GROANS) I have to find love. We don't have it where I'm from, and if I can't find it in three days, I'm sunk. You don't have love? No. My dad says it's just a myth. We marry who our parents pick. And my dad thinks that I have bubbles in my brain because I believe in love. He says that the only way I can get out of my wedding is if I can prove to him that love exists. But that means I only get three days. Or else I'll be swimming down the aisle with that... (SHUDDERS)... that blowfish. But if you don't have love, how do you know it exists? I saw it once. And I want it. (RAY WHOOPING) Yeah!

No, Raymond's way too popular. - You should pick someone else. - I mean, all the girls are after him. - Even a few boys. - Right. Fine. Then you don't get your wish. - Wish?! - What?!

There we go, we're turning around. Yeah, we're turning around, everything's okay... Hailey! Claire! - Sunset! - Oh, no! CLAIRE: She's gonna pop a tail! - Hailey! Claire! - Just add moonlight or water! AQUAMARINE: I have to get back! RAYMOND: Hey, hey... Here, let's talk about something to, um, distract you, okay? Like, um... what are you doing tomorrow night? You've probably heard about the Last Splash? - We're coming, Aqua! - Paddle! It's a... a party type thing. - Wow, you're really in a hurry. - It's not your fault. I just... I have to be somewhere. Oh. Hey, you've got to help our friend! - She's really sick. She's got... - Hydrophobia! Yeah. hypertension! - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. - CLAIRE: Come on, please. - This is serious. (QUIETLY) Faster! BOY: Hey! Oh, no! (DOLPHIN SQUEAKS) Come on, you're almost there. - You're almost there. - Pardon me. Excuse me. - Sorry. Pardon me. - Ow! Careful! Hey! Let's go, let's go! Keep going! Don't stop! CLAIRE: Bikes around the corner! Run! - I'm sorry! - Let's go! It was so much fun. CLAIRE: Aqua, go, go! We gotta get you back! I'll be right back. Hey, Ray. That was too close. I need some water to spend the night in. How about the ocean? No. No ocean... my father would just manipulate the currents and pull me back home. I know a place. AQUAMARINE: Holy mackerel! (CHUCKLES) Come on. (DOLPHIN SQUEAKS) Come on, let's go. - HAILEY: Claire, you doing this? - Uh-uh. Aren't you coming? I-I don't do water. On the ground or in the air. Raymond was about to kiss you with his actual lips! (GRUNTS) Stupid sun! HAILEY: Did Ray say anything? He asked if I heard of Last Splash. BOTH: What?! - What, really? - Exactly what did he say? Uh... I can't remember. So was it "Are you going?" or "Will you go with me?" - Is there a difference? - Huge. - Major. - Okay, well, it started with... "What are you doing tomorrow night?" -Oh, my God -Oh my god that is all you need to know. Oh, my God, he was totally asking you out on a date! - He was? - Absolutely. Yes! (LAUGHTER) Be careful, guys. - (LOUD CLANG) - (SCREAMS) (GASPS) Thanks. Sure. AQUAMARINE: Why won't Claire come with us? HAILEY: She's not good around water. - It's kind of a long story. - Hm. HAILEY: Wow... I wish I could hide out here with you. (DOLPHIN SQUEAKING) (DOOR CREAKS) Is this gonna be okay? Yeah. (LAUGHS) (SQUEAKS) (SPLASHING) (SPLASHING) (AMBIENT SOUNDS) Wow. (CHUCKLES) I almost forgot. Me, too. (LAUGHS) This is nice. (CHUCKLES) Good. Are you gonna be okay in here? (CHUCKLES) Are you gonna be okay out there? Mm? (CHUCKLES) I'll see you tomorrow... fish butt! I heard that! (LAUGHS) HAILEY: I never realized how big this room was. Without all my stuff in it. I want this wish so bad, Claire. (CHUCKLES) - Claire? - Hm? Do you think he'll fall in actual love with her, in two days? He has to. I-It's her last hope. (GASPS) - Hailey? - What? We completely forgot something. What's Aqua gonna wear to the Last Splash? I mean, she can't keep wearing your T-shirts. No offence. Hey, hey. We'll take the first bus into Tampa tomorrow, and we'll go shopping. - Wha...? No. We can't! - No, we have to. Besides, I have $400 saved up from working at the aquarium. Do you know how much trouble we'll be in? Come on, Clairedy cat.

They're my favorite aquatic accessory. You see that buoy out there? I need you to swim out there and find me a couple of starfish about... mmm, this big. Live starfish? That's what you wear for earrings? They compliment me. Seriously, Aqua, I've got some earrings that'll compliment you just fine. No. I mean, they literally give me compliments. - In my ear. They talk to me. - Huh? Starfish are notorious suck-ups. They love to give compliments. But it's nice when you need a little boost. - (BUOY BELL CLANGS) - Okay, guys, let's go. Hailey, I can't.

Well, I've only seen love up close once, but if you'd seen it the way I did, you'd feel the same way. Why? What was it like? It was years ago. Not too far from here, actually. We were migrating through the bay, just like we always do this time of year, and... I saw this couple out sailing on their little blue boat, and the way they looked at each other, it was a look I'd never seen anywhere else in the seven seas. I've wanted someone to look at me that way ever since. I looked for them every year, but I never saw them again. Was there a name... on the boat? Mm, I don't remember, Claire. Oh, the Claire de Lune. That's my parents. Claire, they really loved each other. I don't think they would've wanted you to be afraid of life. I think they would've wanted you to be friends with it. (VOICE BREAKING) Yeah. (HAILEY SHOUTING) Whoo! Hailey! (SIGHS) It was the most incredible thing ever. It was something I wish I could've done with you. STARFISH: Aqua! Aqua! There you go. STARFISH: Oh, Aqua! SERVER: And for you. HAILEY: Thank you. STARFISH: Aquamarine is so lovely. Oh, stop... She makes us so lovely just being near such loveliness. (GENTLE SUCTIONING) And she's smart. Smart, yes, like tuna! Like tuna. We love being near Aqua. Aqua, Aqua, Aqua! (GIGGLING) Look who it is. Wow, the blue hair's spreading. You guys look like the grandma brigade. What's next, dentures or Depends? What's next is I'm going with Raymond to the Last Splash. I've got some advice. You need to separate fantasy from reality. Ray's going to the Last Splash with Cecilia. She asked him last night at the street fair. What?! I'd love to stay and chat, but we're late for Cecilia's pre-party. I've got some advice for you two. (SHRIEKING) (LAUGHING) (GASPING) Put on a dry shirt. - That was totally amazing! - That was crazy! It's Ray. I can't believe I was so stupid! Why would he choose her over me? You're supposed to know him. He obviously doesn't like me at all! That's not possible. I never should've trusted you in the first place. Aqua, he's into you! This doesn't make sense! Bull shark! Forget it. I'm going home. Aqua, no! Wait! HAILEY: Claire... this is totally, completely... eternally over. I'm moving. (SIGHS) I'm going to be the new girl again. You know what? No. No, we're going to split up. You're going to go stop Aqua, and... and I'm going to go find Raymond, okay? Meet me back at the club as soon as possible. Hurry! Go! (WAVES GURGLING) HAILEY: Aqua, don't do it! Don't do it! Aqua, you can't do this! Why not? I'm never going to see him again. And you know what? He doesn't care. I'm just going to go home. This was all for nothing. It was not for nothing, it was for love. You know what I think of love? Love stinks. No wonder we don't have it back home. Please don't give up yet. Why, because of your wish? Let me tell you something. My dad said he loved me. He said he loved my mother, and then he left us. He left us for some other woman... but I guess that's just the way it is and love doesn't always work. I don't understand. That's life. That's how it is here. But when you find love, I guess it's really beautiful, or at least that's what I've read in magazines. And I don't know as much about it as I say I do, but I know that there's a reason why everybody wants it so much. And what's that? It's the closest thing we have to magic. Don't give up yet. Oh, my God! What's happening to me? I'm leaking! (LAUGHING) Aqua, you're crying. I'm leaking saltwater. I'm falling apart. No, they're tears. Your body makes them when you cry. I guess you wouldn't have them, living underwater. This is crazy. Next you're going to tell me water shoots out of your nose when you're happy. (LAUGHING) Only occasionally. (CHATTING INDISTINCTLY) (BIKE BELL RINGS) Nice bike. (GIRLS SNICKERING) Still has tassels. Time for a swim! (SQUEALING) Excuse me. How could you do this to Aqua? Uh, do what? Take Cecilia to the Last Splash after you already asked Aquamarine. Yeah, well, that was before I found out that she has a boyfriend. - A boyfriend? - Yeah. The one she practically jumped overboard for to watch the sunset? Aqua doesn't have a boyfriend. Who told you that? Vince! - Vince! - Huh? - The little girl wants to go in. - I want to go in where? (SING-SONGY) Into the pool! (SCREAMING): No! Put me down! No! No! No! No! Hey, hey, hey, Vince, don't, man, don't! Stop! - (SCREAMING) - Hey, put her down. Come on. VINCE: Okay, okay. Whoo! Geez, relax. What's the big drama? VINCE: Pfft! Whatever. (SNIFFLES) (SOBBING) God, take a joke. "Take a joke"? Wha-What's the matter with you? She's scared. She was trying to get attention. Hello! No, that's your job, isn't it, Cecilia? Raymond, I was kidding. Joke? Hello! (SNIFFLING) Claire, Claire, hold on. Hey, you okay? Look, um, do you know where I can find Aqua?

Right, but I was thinking about it all last night, and... um, my mom has worked all her life for this. Maybe it's not fair. We asked for a miracle, Hailey, and we got it. We're using it. Maybe we could wish for something else, maybe. Something else? - Mm-hmm. - Like what? Like a new best friend? A new person to tell everything to? Claire, no, stop it. How can you even think that way? I'm just saying, maybe we'll learn to stand on our own for a change, you know? You mean me, don't you? I mean I'm not your mom. Please.

CECILIA: I was just out for my morning run, and all of a sudden I heard this horrible screaming. I didn't know what to do, and, I mean, I did the first thing that came to my mind, which was go to inform the newscast, and, um, you know, we can only hope that we find her. The ladder's gone. Oh, no. I just did what any good citizen would have done. And we can only hope that they'll pull her out in time, so she can be reunited with her friends and loved ones.

Let's go up top. I mean, that's... if you want to do that. - I want to. Yeah. - Yeah? Cool, 'cause then, afterwards, um, I know this great little... Uh, actually, it's a total dive, but they have the best hot dogs ever. - Raymond... - Yeah? I have to ask you something. Oh, right, right, yeah. Okay, shoot. I came here looking for something... I wasn't even sure existed. But... then I met you, and now I have to ask you. Ask me. - Try the binoculars. - Don't yell at me. Raymond... Yeah? Do you love me? Uh... Well... I mean... we've had one date. What's going on? But don't get me wrong, don't get me wrong. I like you, I really, really like you. Wait, I think he's, I think he's reaching out for her. That's a good sign. Look. I mean, I think you're smart and beautiful, and different than anyone I've ever met before, and I'd like to see a lot more of you. But... you don't love me. She's pulling away. - Let me see what's going on. - Wait, no... is she? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. Hey... are you crying? Yes. Apparently, it's something I do. I don't understand. I mean, why do I have to be in love with you today? Why can't we just... work our way there? (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) I have a better idea. Why doesn't she just go back to where she came from? (GASPING) - Oh, no! - No! What the hell's the matter with you? (GASPS) Oh, my God. Raymond! Raymond! Just stay calm! Don't fight the current. I'll be right there! He still chooses her over me? She's a fish! (SHRIEKS) Raymond! HAILEY and CLAIRE: Aqua! Aqua! We're coming! Her dad's pulling her back. RAY: I'm going to get my rescue board! We can't just let her go. I'm going in. No. Not without me, you're not. (GASPING, COUGHING) Hailey! Hailey! - Claire, come on. - Hailey! Claire! Grab the buoy! We'll meet you there. - (COUGHING) - I'm right here. - I won't leave you. - Hailey, I can't! Keep your eye on the buoy! (GRUNTING) (COUGHING) I'm coming. Grab my hand. Hailey! You can do it. I can't believe you two. It's not safe out here. The storm's too strong. Why is your dad pulling you back now? He can't just take you away. Yes, he can. That was our deal. Take our wish... (GASPS) and you can stay here. I can't. Yeah, take it. And you can call off your wedding. But there's no wish. What?! Raymond doesn't love me. My father was right. I couldn't prove love exists. I'm so sorry. - Can't we do something?! - Yeah, anything! What more could you do for me? You jumped in the water to save me. And now you'd give me your wish? Why would you do that for me? I... I don't know. I guess it's what I would do for her, and... I know she'd do it for me, and just... because we love you, Aqua. You do? I didn't know you leak when you're happy, too. Look. Your dad's letting you go. Because of you. What? Don't you see? You just proved to him that love exists. (LAUGHING) I guess you get a wish after all. Any requests? (CHUCKLES) Can we wish for you to stay here forever? I'm a mermaid, Claire. I have a family out there that needs me. Yeah. As much as I want to stay, I belong in the ocean... most of the time. Save your wish, okay? I promise I'll come back to visit. And if I have to swim against the Gulf Stream, from here to Australia, I'll do it. I'd circle the world for you two. (QUIET, GENTLE THEME PLAYING) So I guess this is it, right? Someone's got to go back and return all those wedding gifts. We're gonna miss you, Aqua. You can always call me on my shell. Oh... I want you guys to have these. Thanks. Starfish may be big suck-ups... ...but they never lie. Aqua... I love you guys, too. Aqua! Aqua! (GASPS) (SQUEALS) Oh, my God. Keep in touch, fish-butt. We want a full report. I'll see you soon! Bye. Bye. Bye. - Race you to the pier. - No, wait. Let's just float a while. I want to enjoy this. Has this been the best summer ever or what? Just wait till next summer when you guys come to Australia and visit me. I don't if I can swing that with my allowance. Uh, Claire... we still have our wish. Oh, my God. - You know what, Hailey? - Huh? It's good to have friends with fins. (LAUGHING) Hey! (BOTH LAUGHING) Wait up! Wow. Wow, I ca... I ca... I can't believe it. Um, he didn't exactly cover this in lifeguard training. I know. I should have told you. I hope you're not, mad. No. No, I'm not, I'm not mad. S-Surprised, definitely, and confused about a couple of things... like... for one, the fact that you have a tail. Yeah, I do. A very nice one, by the way. ( SQUEALS ) I know. Are you... planning to surface any-anytime soon? That sounds... I don't know what I'm talking about. (CLEARS THROAT) I'm not sure how to ask a mermaid out... but I'd like to see you again... I mean, if that's... allowed or-or even possible. Well, I have to swim back for a bit... clear the water with my dad. Would you mind waiting a little while? Maybe you could meet me in Fiji sometime. Uh-huh. (BUOY BELL RINGS) ♪♪ - Leonard? - Leonard? Good day, ladies. Hey, girls. Hey. Oh, that's really sweet. I'm really happy for them. Hailey! Claire! Hey. - Hi. - Hi. Look, I just... had to tell you guys thanks. You're both, um... you're both pretty extraordinary. I don't even know if I could have done what you did. See you. Oh, my goodness! I'll see you soon? I'm going to miss you so much. I know. I'm going to miss you, too. STARFISH: Hailey's so beautiful, inside and out. She's the best friend you could ever have. STARFISH: Claire is so courageous. Claire has a true heart. She understands... A true friend... She will never let you down. She glows from the inside.
