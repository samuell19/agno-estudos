[gentle piano] [uplifting music] â™ª - I WISH THEY WOULDN'T FLY SO LOW. - PROBABLY LOOKING FOR GIRLS. YOU SUNBATHE IN THE BACKYARD, MY BEAUTY, YOU'LL ATTRACT A WHOLE FLIGHT'EM. - HOW WOULD YOU KNOW? YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ME SUNBATHE. - MAN, I GOT VIVID IMAGINATION. THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME SUCH A GOOD NEWSPAPERMAN. - I WONDER WHO HE IS. PROBABLY SOME BOY FAR AWAY FROM HOME. - AHH, SOME YOUNG BOY, THAT'S FOR SURE. WARS ARE MADE BY MEN TOO OLD AND FAT TO FIGHT AND FOUGHT BY KIDS TO YOUNG TO KNOW BETTER. - WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT? - I JUST MADE IT UP. I THINK I'LL USE IT IN MY NEWSPAPER COLUMN NEXT WEEK. - YOU'LL JUST MAKE PEOPLE MAD. - WELL, THAT'S WHAT PAPERS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. - JAKE, WERE YOU CANTANKEROUS BEFORE YOU BECAME A NEWSPAPER MAN, OR DID THE PAPER MAKE YOU THAT WAY? - NO, I WAS BORN WITH IT, MY BEAUTY, RUNS IN THE FAMILY. THE WHOLE TIBBETTS BUNCH THAT'S WHY WE ARE ALL NEWSPAPER MEN. NOW WHERE'S LONNIE? WE GOTTA GET TO TOWN. MORNING'S WASTING. - PROBABLY OFF YONDER IN THE WOODS PLAYING WHATEVER IT IS HE PLAYS. YOU CAN TELL HE'S YOUR GRANDSON. - AH. CANTANKEROUS, HUH? - NO, OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION. - LONNIE! LONNIE! YOU COME TO TOWN WITH ME, BOY, YOU BETTER GET A MOVE ON. LONNIE! LONNIE! AND WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING IN THERE? PLAYING IN MY HIDEOUT. - WHAT YOU GOT BEHIND YOUR BACK GOOD GRIEF,THAT'S NOT A TOY, BOY. YOU CAN CUT OFF A LEG WITH THAT. - I'VE BEEN REAL CAREFUL WITH IT, DADDY JAKE. I WOULDN'T SCRATCH IT UP FOR NOTHIN'. - YOUR GREAT-GREAT-GRANDDADDY, CAPTAIN FINLEY TIBBETTS CARRIED THIS SWORD AT GETTYSBURG. HE RODE RIGHT UP CEMETARY RIDGE AND CUT OLD GENERAL ULYSSES S. GRANT'S HEAD. - YOU'RE LYING. YOUR EAR'S TWITCHIN'. - UH YOU CUT ME TO THE QUICK, BOY. QUESTIONIN' THE FAMILY HONOR HERE. TAKE THAT BACK.PUT IT IN THE HOUSE. - GIVE IT TO ME. I WILL PUT IT BACK. DID YOU MAKE YOUR BED THIS MORNING? - YES'M. - I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY ANYBODY IN HIS RIGHT MIND WOULD WANNA KEEP A SWORD IN A HOUSE WHERE A SMALL BOY COULD GET TO IT. ALL THE TIME YOUR FATHER WAS GROWING UP, HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO TOUCH IT. - ALL RIGHT, ALLIGHT. WE HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY. I'LL WAIT FOR YOU OUT FRONT. - WHY DON'T DADDY JAKE EVER TALK ABOUT MY DADDY? - WELL, THAT'SA LONG STORY, HONEY. - LONNIE! - GO ON BEFORE HE BUSTS A GUSSET. [bell tolling] - WHY HAVEN'T YOU EVER BOUGHT A CAR DADDY JAKE? BECAUSE I GOT TWO GOOD LEGS. - BUT IF YOU HAD A CAR, YOU COULD GET TO TOWN QUICKER, AND MAMA PASTINE WOULDN'T HAVE TO TOW THE GROCERIES HOME - AND IF A FROG STRAPPED ON A FIRECRACKER, HE COULD JUMP FARTHER. WOULDN'T DO THE FROG MUCH GOOD THOUGH. AN OLD MAN NEEDS HIS EXERCISE. - OH, YOU AIN'T OLD, DADDY JAKE. - I'M GAINING ON IT. - NOW DON'T YOU GO TELLIN' EVERYBODY THAT TOMORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY. - LOOKS LIKE MR. BRUNSON'S FRYING HIS EGG. - BISCUIT'S BEEN FRYING AN EGG ON THE SIDEWALK EVERY SUMMER ABOUT THIS TIME SINCE AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER. IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST EXCITING THING THAT'LL HAPPEN AROUND HERE ALL WEEK. I'LL TAKE MINE SCRAMBLED -HEY WHY DON'T YOU GO TO THE NEWSPAPER AND GET YOUR CAMERA - AH, PLENTY OF TIME FOR THAT, BISCUIT. LAST YEAR THE EGG STILL HADN'T FRIED BY SUNDOWN. BIG OLD DOG COME ALONG AND LICKED IT UP. NOT HOT ENOUGH YET. - WELL, IT'S HOT ENOUGH TO FRY A FAT MAN. HEY, LONNIE, LET'S GO HAVE SOME COFFEE, VICTORY DONUT. HUH? - YES, SIR, GRANDDADDY ROSH. - COME ON. - IT WAS A GOOD SPEECH YOU GAVE YESTERDAY. - LONNIE, THAT MUST'VE BEEN A RED-LETTER DAY TO YOU. YOU GOT TO SIT THERE AND SEE YOUR GRANDFATHER, THE MAYOR, DELIVER THE FOURTH OF JULY SPEECH AND WATCH YOUR GRANDFATHER, THE EDITOR, TAKE A NAP IN THE AUDIENCE. - YEAH. I'M JUST GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT. YEAH, LAST YEAR HE WAS LAID UP WITH A BROKEN LEG AFTER HE FELL OFF HIS TOOL SHED ROOF WHILE LOOKING FOR ENEMY AIRCRAFT. - NO, THAT--THAT WAS BEFORE. - I REMEMBER THE HEADLINE IN THE FREE PRESS- AIR RAID WARDEN CRASHES, TOWN SURVIVES. [laughter] - JAKE, YOU'VE BEEN TRYINGTO MAKE ME A LAUGHINGSTOCK EVER SINCE I TOOK THE AIR-RAID WARDEN'S JOB BACK IN 1941. AND I THINK IT'S SERIOUS BUSINESS. - IT AIN'T DIGNIFIED FOR A BANKER TO BE CRAWLING AROUND ON TOP OF HIS TOOL SHED BESIDES, YOU'RE TO OLD FOR THAT BUSINESS JUST LIKE I'M TOO OLD TO BE CRAWLING AROUND UNDER FOLKS' WORE-OUT CARS TRYING TO KEEP THEM RUNNING. - OLD? YOU AIN'T OLD, FOG. - OF COURSE I AM. GETTING OLD. YOU'RE GETTING OLD. EVERYBODY HERE IS JUST ABOUT WORE OUT LIKE AN AUTOMOBILE. - DADDY JAKE'S GONNA BE 64 TOMORROW. - SEE WHAT I MEAN? WE'RE ALL GOING TO SIEGE. JAKE'S BOY HENRY WILL BE PUTTING OUT THE NEWSPAPER. - I HOPE THE U.S. ARMY HAS DONE SOMETHING WITH HENRY, 'CAUSE I NEVER COULD. [airplane approaching] [airplane very close] [gun shot] [window crash] - LOOK AT THAT WINDOW. - THEY'VE SHOT OUT MY WINDOW. [gunshots] [ricochet] - STOP IT, HILTON. YOU'RE GONNA KILL US ALL. - LONNIE! - IT'S AN AIR ATTACK. FOG, COME ON, WE GOTTA GO GET THE FIRE TRUCK. - IT AIN'T AN ATTACK. IT'S ONE OF OURS. - LOOK HERE, IT'S A BULLET HOLE. OLLIE, THEY SHOOTING AT THE CAFE! [car horn honks] - HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE? I CAN'T MAKE ANY CONNECTIONS WITH ALL THAT RACKET. - IT'S AN AIR ATTACK, EM. TURN THE SIREN ON OVER AT THE FIRE STATION. - AN AIR RAID, FOLKS. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PLANES THERE WERE, BUT THEY SEEM TO HAVE DONE SOME DAMAGE TO BRUNSON'S CAFE. THIS NEWS BULLETIN BY THE WAY IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY REDLINGER'S FUNERAL HOME. - YOU ALL RIGHT? - OF COURSE I AM. IT'S ONE OF OURS. IT'S A STEARMAN PT-17, A TRAINING PLANE. DON'T EVEN HAVE GUNS ON IT. - ARE YOU SURE? - YEAH, I RECOGNIZED IT FROM MR. RENFROE'S SILHOUETTE CHART. - ROSH. LONNIE SAYS IT'S ONE OF OURS. TRAINING PLANE, NO GUNS. [siren wailing] - GO HOME. GO HOME. EVERYBODY, GO ON HOME. WE'RE SITTING DUCKS OUT HERE. GO HOME AND FILL YOUR BATHTUBS UP WITH WATER. - NO! LET'S DON'T HAVE A PANIC HERE. OLLIE, YOU STOP BROADCASTING ABOUT AN AIR ATTACK AND PUT ON SOME MUSIC. - BUT, ROSH, WE GOT TO ALERT THE TOWN. - ABOUT WHAT? - THE AIR RAID. - ONE AIRPLANE, TUNSTALL. YOU, GO OVER TO THE PHONE EXCHANGE AND TELL EM NESBITT TO TURN OFF THAT FIRE SIREN. NOW LET'S JUST KEEP OUR WITS ABOUT US HERE. - HEY, JAKE. IT'S YOUR WIFE. SHE SAID AN AIRPLANE JUST LANDED ON THE ROAD OUT IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE. - COME ON. - WHAT? - WELL, I'VE COME TO TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE. - YOU'RE A FOOL, BILLY BENEFIELD. GO AWAY. [vehicles approaching] [siren wailing] - HOLD HER STEADY, FROG, AND I'LL BORE HIS TIRES OUT-- - HOLD ON THERE, HILTON. THAT'S MY BOY. THAT'S BILLY. YOU MEN STAY PUT. I'LL HANDLE THIS. BILLY, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE? WAS THAT YOU IN TOWN A FEW MINUTES AGO? - WELL, YES, SIR. WELL, I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF MR. RENFROE WAS IN THE BANK BEFORE I CAME OUT HERE TO SEE ALSATIA. I JUST GOT TOO LOW AND I HAD TO TAKE HER UNDERNEATH THE WIRES. - WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ALSATIA? - WELL, I CAME TO TAKE HER FOR A RIDE. - IN AN ARMY AIRCRAFT - [stammers] BILLY, YOU LACK JUDGMENT. - I LOVE YOU. WON'T YOU COME? - NO. BUT YOU'RE WONDERFUL. COME BACK WHEN THE WAR IS OVER. - I GUESS I MESSED UP. - HOW LONG ARE YOU OVERDUE AT YOUR BASE? - LESS THAN AN HOUR. I'M ON A CROSS-COUNTRY. - I'LL SEE IF I CAN FIX IT. [uplifting music] - WHO'S THAT? COME BACK. COME BACK. COME BACK. - Y'ALL DIDN'T ALL HAVE TO COME GET ME. YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT I WAS A PARADE OR SOMETHIN'. - YOU JUST HUSH UP, MR. SMARTY-PANTS. WITH ALL THE COMMOTION YOU CAUSED TODAY, I THINK YOU'LL BE PRAYING FOR YOUR MORTAL SOUL, OR AT LEAST THE SEAT OF YOUR BRITCHES. - WHO'S THAT ON THE STEPS? - MAY WE HELP YOU? - ARE YOU THE TIBBETTS? - WHY? - WELL, I'M FRANCINE TIBBETTS, HENRY'S WIFE, AND I'M ABOUT TO HAVE HIS BABY ON YOUR STEPS. - JAKE, CALL THE DOCTOR. ROSH, YOU AND LONNIE GET HER THINGS. COME ON, LET'S GET YOU UPSTAIRS. WE DON'T NEED ANY BABIES BORN ON THE FRONT STEPS. - HOLY COW, A BABY. GOSH, CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? DOES THAT MAKE ME AN UNCLE? - NO, THAT MAKES YOU A BROTHER. THE BABY WILL BE YOUR FATHER'S CHILD, JUST LIKE YOU ARE. - GEE. CAN I CALL UP UNCLE BRUNSON TO TELL HIM I'M GONNA BE A BROTHER? - UH, JUST A MINUTE, LONNIE. JAKE, DON'T YOU WANNA CALL THE DOCTOR FIRST? - NO. - JAKE, DON'T BE DIFFICULT. - IT'S HENRY, PULLING ANOTHER ONE OF HIS TRICKS. HE'S BEEN DOING IT SINCE HE WAS BORN. - IS HE ON THE WAY? DID YOU CALL THE DOCTOR? - HOW DO WE KNOW THAT SHE'S HENRY'S WIFE? - SHE'S HIS WIFE, ALL RIGHT. SHE'S GOT A MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE. HER NAME USED TO BE FRANCINE WALCZYNSKI, AND SHE'S FROM CLEVELAND, OHIO. THEY WERE MARRIED IN TEXAS BEFORE HE SHIPPED OUT. - JUST LIKE HIM. GETTING A WOMAN IN TROUBLE AND THEN LIGHTING OUT FOR EUROPE. - LONNIE, HOW ABOUT WE GO OUTSIDE FOR A WHILE, HUH? - JAKE, YOU'VE GONE FAR ENOUGH. YOU CAN DISOWN HENRY BUT NOT HIS WIFE AND CHILD. YOU CALL THE DOCTOR OR GET OUT. YOU'RE A HARD AND STUBBORN MAN. NOW GET OUT. I'LL CALL THE DOCTOR. WE CAN DO WITHOUT YOU. - I WILL NOT. - YOU WILL NOT? - I WILL NOT! - ALL RIGHT THEN. OH. YOU GET OUT, OR I'LL CUT YOUR HEAD OFF. - NOW, LOOK, PUT THAT DOWN, PASTINE. PASTINE, PUT DOWN THAT SWORD BEFORE YOU HURT YOURSELF--AH! YOU KNOW-- - NO YOU DON'T, JAKE, DON'T START IN WITH YOUR WORDS. YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND YOUR FEET MOVIN'. COME ON! COME ON! - PUT THAT DOWN. YOU HEAR ME? COME ON! COME ON! STOP THAT! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU ANYWAY? NOBODY'S GONNA RUN ME OUT OF MY OWN HOME WITH MY OWN GRANDFATHER'S SWORD. YOU COULD'VE CUT MY HEAD OFF! YOU SEE WHAT SHE DID? - JAKE, I DON'T THINK YOU OUGHT TO TRY GETTING BACK IN THERE AGAIN. NOW, LET'S JUST GET OURSELVES ORGANIZED AND TALK THIS THING OUT LIKE SENSIBLE FOLKS. - YOU CALL THAT SENSIBLE? - I CALL THAT PRETTY PERSUASIVE. - THEN WHAT AM I GONNA DO IF I CAN'T GET BACK INTO MY OWN HOUSE? - STAY AT THE NEWSPAPER. TALK TO YOUR TYPEWRITER. YOU'RE AN ARBITRARY OLD FOOL, JAKE. YOU HAVE NO MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS IN YOU, NOT WHERE YOUR SON IS CONCERNED. - ALL RIGHT, PASTINE. IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT IT. CAN I HAVE MY HAT? - UH-HUH. [door slams] - YOU THINK I'M AN ARBITRARY OLD FOOL TOO? - 'BOUT SOME THINGS, YES. - 'BOUT HENRY? - THAT, MOSTLY. - YOU KNOW, I FORGAVE HIM FOR A LOT. - MAYBE NOT ENOUGH. - DON'T TELL ME THAT YOU FORGAVE HIM? AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TO HAZEL? - I DIDN'T FORGIVE OR NOT FORGIVE, JAKE. I JUST GOT ON WITH THINGS. - YEAH. I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO. JUST GET ON WITH THINGS. [grumbles] - AND I HEAR SHE NEARBY CUT HIS HEAD OFF WITH THAT SWORD THEY KEEP OVER THE FIREPLACE. - WELL, DID THE WOMAN HAVE THE BABY? - YES, SHE HAD A LITTLE GIRL. OLD DOC AMESWORTH WAS BY HERE A LITTLE WHILE AGO. HE SAYS, "YOU TAKE ONE LOOK AT HER, AND YOU CAN SURE TELL SHE'S HENRY'S." [laughter] - HEY, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW JAKE HANDLES THIS WHOLE THING IN THE PAPER. YOU DON'T RECKON HE'LL PUT IT ON THE SOCIETY PAGES? - [clears throat] - GOOD MORNING, GENTS. all: GOOD MORNING, JAKE. - LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED TO ME YESTERDAY. - YEAH. - OH, COME ON, JAKE. DON'T TAKE ALL THE FUN OUT OF IT. - YEAH, YEAH. I IMAGINE YOU HEARD THE WHOLE THING ALREADY WITH EMBELLISHMENTS. AND MY VERSION WILL BE DULL BY COMPARISON. WELL, NEEDLESS TO SAY, IF PASTINE'S ARM HAD JUST BEEN A TAD BIT LONGER, I'D BE SITTING HERE HEADLESS. [laughter] ANYWAY, I COULD EAT A HORSE. - COMING UP. - I HEARD CALVIN GOING ON THE RADIO LAST NIGHT. HE SAID SOON AS OUR BOYS BREAK OUT OF NORMANDY, IT'S ALL OVER. JUST A QUESTION OF HOW QUICK THEY CAN GET TO BERLIN. - OUR BOYS ARE GONNA BE HOME BEFORE LONG, YOU'LL SEE. WE'LL GET EVERYTHING BACK TO NORMAL. - THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS NORMAL ANYMORE. WAR'S CHANGED ALL THAT. - I WONDER IF IT'S GONNA BE SAFE. I MEAN, ALL THOSE BOYS, TRAINED KILLERS? WE DON'T KNOW WHAT COMBATS DONE TO 'EM. YOU COULD HAVE A YOUNG FELLA STANDING ON THE STREET CORNER, AND SUDDENLY A CAR BACKFIRES, AND HE GRABS THE NEAREST GUN, STARTS SHOOTING. - INSTEAD OF WORRYING ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT, WHY DON'T WE SPEND SOME TIME THINKING ABOUT A PROPER MEMORIAL? - WE GOT NO BUSINESS PUTTIN' UP A WAR MEMORIAL. - THEM THAT FIGHT GET TO MEMORIALIZE. ME AND MY NEWSPAPER ARE DEAD SET AGAINST IT. - DADDY JAKE? - YEAH? - I BRUNG YOU SOME STUFF. IT'S UNDERWEAR MOSTLY. - UNDERWEAR? - YES, SIR. MAMA PASTINE SAYS, IF YOU DON'T CHANGE YOUR UNDERWEAR REGULAR, YOU'LL GET THE DRY ROT. - WELL, WHAT'S THIS? - IT'S A BIRTHDAY PRESENT. - CAN I OPEN IT? - SURE. I COULDN'T FIND ANY RIBBON, SO I JUST USED SOME STRING. - WELL, NOW, LET ME SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE. WELL, MY FAVORITE BRAND. THANK YOU. - YOU'RE WELCOME. I BOUGHT IT WITH MY OWN MONEY. - WELL, OF COURSE. WELL, THIS IS A SPLENDID GESTURE. I'LL HAVE ONE OF THESE WITH MY SUPPER TONIGHT. WHEREVER IT IS I'M GONNA HAVE MY SUPPER TONIGHT. MAMA PASTINE KNOW YOU'RE HERE? - NO, SIR. I HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE FOR A WHILE. THAT BABY DON'T DO NOTHING BUT SQUALL. - OH, LONNIE, ABOUT-- ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY... I-I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. I LOVE YOUR GRANDMOTHER. SHE'S PUT UP WITH ME FOR A GOOD MANY YEARS. SHE JUST GOT--GOT OVERWROUGHT. - YOU'RE GONNA LIVE HERE? - NO, CERTAINLY NOT. THIS IS A NEWSPAPER OFFICE, NOT A BOARDING HOUSE. LORD KNOWS IF SHE DOESN'T COME DOWN AND HELP ME WITH THE BOOKS THIS WEEK LIKE SHE ALWAYS DOES, I'M A DOOMED MAN. - I'D HELP YOU. - WELL, I KNOW YOU WOULD, BOY, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT MYSELF, MUCH LESS TEACH ANYBODY. - WELL, YOU COULD TEACH ME ABOUT PRINTING. I COULD HELP YOU GET OUT THE PAPER. - OH, YOU WANNA BE A NEWSPAPERMAN? - I RECKON I'D LIKE TO TRY. - WELL, IT'S HONORABLE WORK. MAYBE THE MOST HONORABLE THERE IS. IT HELPS IF YOU HAVE A THICK SKIN, HEAD LIKE A MULE, A LITTLE IMAGINATION. THIS NEWSPAPER HAS USED UP TWO GENERATIONS OF TIBBETTS MEN. SOMETIMES IT EATS MY INSIDES OUT. YOU GO HOME AND ASK YOUR MAMA PASTINE. AND IF SHE SAYS IT'S OKAY, WELL, THEN IT'S OKAY. [chuckles] - [hums] [baby crying] - THE LITTLE BOOGER DON'T DO NOTHING BUT HOLLER. IT'S LIKE LIVING INSIDE A FIRE STATION. - THAT'S NOT A LITTLE BOOGER, LONNIE. THAT'S YOUR SISTER. - HALF-SISTER. - IT'S THE SAME THING. - NOT TO ME IT AIN'T, MY BEAUTY. - DON'T YOU SASS ME, YOUNG MAN. - YES'M. OH, I HAVE SOMETHING TO ASK YOU. COULD IT BE OKAY-- - GOOD HEAVENS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF BED? HERE, COME UP AND SIT DOWN. THIS IS LONNIE, HENRY'S BOY. - NICE TO MEET YA. [machine whirring] [knock at door] - ROSH? - I BROUGHT YOU A COT FROM THE FIRE STATION. WELL, YOU GONNA HELP ME, OR AM I GONNA HAVE TO TOTE THIS THING THE REST OF THE WAY IN BY MYSELF? I AM TOO OLD AND TOO FAT FOR HONEST WORK. AND I NEED A DRINK. - WELL, I'M BUSY. I GOTTA GET A NEWSPAPER OUT. I'M NOT LIKE A LAWYER. POST OFFICE DOESN'T GRANT POSTPONEMENTS. - DRINK NOW. SPREAD WISDOM LATER. - YOUR HEALTH, SIR. - AND YOURS, SIR. MUST BE FAIRLY GOOD WHISKEY. WE'VE DRUNK ENOUGH OF IT IN OUR TIME. - YEAH, I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY WE CALLED IT LIGHTNING JIM'S BEST. IS THERE A LIGHTNING JIM'S WORST? - IF THERE IS, I HOPE IT NEVER PASSES MY LIPS. IF IT WERE ANY WORSE, IT'D PROBABLY KILL US. - SOONER OR LATER, SOMETHING WILL. - I SUPPOSE IT'S BETTER THAN GETTING STRUNG UP. - OH, THINK THAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO ME? - YEAH, SOMETIMES YOU WEAR THIS NEWSPAPER LIKE A HAIR SHIRT, JAKE. - IT MAKES PEOPLE THINK. - OH, LORD KNOWS YOU DO THAT. YOU'VE BEEN A BURR UNDER THIS TOWN'S SADDLE FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER, AND GENERALLY WE'RE BETTER OFF FOR IT. BUT THIS TIME FOLKS THINK YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR. OH, IF I HAD TO WORRY ABOUT GOING TOO FAR, I'D NEVER PRINT ANYTHING EXCEPT SOCIETY NEWS AND THE CLASSIFIED ADS. I DECIDED A LONG TIME AGO THAT A MAN HAS TO TAKE HIS LIFE IN HIS OWN TWO HANDS AND SHAKE IT FOR ALL ITS WORTH. EVERYONE ELSE CAN DO THEIR OWN SHAKING. - I JUST WISH YOU BELIEVED IT. - WHAT? - YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT A MAN TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIMSELF. IF YOU DID, YOU WOULDN'T CARRY OTHER FOLKS' GUILT AROUND IN A PEDDLER'S SACK. YOU'D LET THEM DO THEIR OWN TOTING. - OH, YOU MEAN HENRY? I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT HENRY SINCE HE GOT DRUNK AND JOINED THE NATIONAL GUARD FOUR YEARS AGO. - YOU PUT ON A BIG SHOW, JAKE. YOU DISOWN HIM, BUT YOU CARRY HENRY AROUND ON YOUR SHOULDERS TRYING NOT TO LET THE REST OF US SEE HOW IT MAKES YOU STOOP. - DO YOU THINK I OUGHT TO FORGET WHAT HENRY DID? YOU OF ALL PEOPLE? - YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID. NOBODY KNOWS HOW IT HAPPENED, NOT EVEN HENRY. - I KNOW HE WAS DRIVIN'. AND HE FLED LIKE A COWARD. - ALL I KNOW IS WHAT IT'S DONE TO YOU, MY FRIEND. - BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, ROSH, I'M NOT GONNA PRINT A WORD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH BILLY AND THAT AIRPLANE. YOU WON THIS ONE. BUT THIS NEWSPAPER IS OPPOSED TO A WAR MEMORIAL. - I SHALL NOW LEAVE YOU, MY DEAR FRIEND. SLEEP TIGHT, SWEET PRINCE. [door opens and shuts] - MAMA PASTINE? - HMM? - I WANT YOU TO TELL ME ABOUT MY DADDY. - WHAT DO YOU WANNA KNOW? - EVERYTHING. YOU NEVER TOLD ME ANYTHING. NOBODY HAS. - OH, LONNIE, IT'S NOT ANYTHING YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT. - YOU THINK I'M TOO YOUNG. I'M ALMOST 14 YEARS OLD. IT'S TIME YOU TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED. MY MOTHER WAS KILLED IN THE WRECK. - YES. YOU WERE FOUR. - HOW'D IT HAPPEN? - NOBODY REALLY KNOWS. THE CAR RAN OFF THE ROAD SOMEHOW. YOUR FATHER WAS THROWN FREE. HE COULDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING AFTERWARD. - THEN WHAT HAPPENED? - HE WAS VERY SAD. WHEN SHE DIED, WELL, HE JUST NEVER GOT OVER IT. - WELL, WHY IS DADDY JAKE MAD AT HIM? IS IT ABOUT THE WRECK? - PARTLY, BUT IT GOES A LONG WAY BACK. YOUR FATHER WAS A DIFFICULT CHILD, ALWAYS HARD TO MANAGE. I THINK HE AND YOUR GRANDFATHER ARE JUST TOO MUCH ALIKE. THEY TRIED, BUT THEY JUST NEVER COULD SEEM TO... PLEASE EACH OTHER. AND THEN THE WRECK. WELL, JAKE BLAMED HENRY, AND HENRY NEVER WOULD DEFEND HIMSELF. THEY JUST SEEMED TO LOSE TOUCH. AND THAT'S WHY YOU CAME TO STAY WITH US. - I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE YOU SAD. I LOVE YOU. AND I LOVE DADDY JAKE TOO. - OF COURSE YOU DO. SO DO I. HE'S A CANTANKEROUS OLD GOAT, BUT I LOVE HIM IN SPITE OF IT. THAT'S WHAT MARRIAGE IS, SOMETIMES, "LOVIN' IN SPITE OF." DOES THIS HELP, ANY OF THIS? - OH, YES, MA'AM. I JUST WANNA KNOW WHO MY DADDY IS. THEN I COULD THINK ABOUT HIM. MAMA PASTINE! DADDY JAKE'S COMIN' HOME. - DON'T BOTHER TO SET FOOT UNLESS YOU COME TO MAKE AMENDS, JAKE. - PASTINE, HENRY'S DEAD. [baby crying] - HE'S BEEN DEAD TO YOU FOR YEARS. - OH, PLEASE, PASTINE, DON'T. NO, HE HASN'T BEEN DEAD TO ME. YOU CAN'T BE ANGRY WITH A DEAD MAN. - BUT YOU CUT HIM OUT OF YOUR LIFE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T MEASURE UP. - I TRIED TO CUT HIM OUT, BUT I COULDN'T. ROSH TOLD ME THE OTHER DAY THAT I'VE BEEN CARRYING HENRY AROUND ON MY BACK. MAYBE WHAT I'VE BEEN REALLY CARRYING IS FAILURE. AND I HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT. - YES, YOU WILL. WE BOTH HAVE TO LIVE WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT LEFT. YOU'VE GOT YOUR NEWSPAPER. - OUR NEWSPAPER. - OH, NO. I'M THROUGH WITH THAT. - OH, PLEASE, PASTINE. I CAN'T MANAGE WITHOUT YOU. THE BOOKS ARE A WRECK. - CAN I HELP? I CAN KEEP BOOKS. WENT TO BUSINESS SCHOOL. GUESS I NEED TO START EARNING MY KEEP. - DON'T YOU EVER FEEL THAT. YOU BELONG HERE. NOW MORE THAN EVER. - YEAH, YOU'RE WELCOME TO TRY IF YOU WANNA. - FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. [indistinct chatter] - I GUESS IT'S ABOUT TIME. ALMOST 10:00. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? - NO, I'M NOT ALL RIGHT. AM I GONNA MAKE IT THROUGH THE DAY? YES, I AM. - WHERE'S JAKE? - I THINK HE'S OUT BACK WITH LT. WHALEN, THE YOUNG MAN WHO BROUGHT THE CASKET HOME. WHY DON'T YOU GO GET HIM? - ALL RIGHT. - WHERE'S LONNIE? - RIGHT HERE, MAMA PASTINE. - I WANT YOU TO BE PROUD OF YOUR FATHER TODAY. AND I WANT HIM TO BE PROUD OF YOU. - YES, MA'AM. I'LL BE OKAY. - I REALLY CAN'T, MR. TIBBETTS. I'M SORRY. - BUT COULD YOU, IF YOU HAD TO. - IF I HAD TO. BUT YOU NEED AN ORDER FROM A HEALTH OFFICIAL. YOU--YOU JUST CAN'T TAKE IT UPON YOURSELF TO DO THAT SORT OF THING. - JAKE, LIEUTENANT, ANYTHING WRONG? - NO, SIR. - I'VE BEEN ASKING THE LIEUTENANT HOW HE KNEW THAT IT WAS HENRY IN THERE. BOTTOM LINE IS, HE DOESN'T. - HUH? WHAT I SAID WAS--IS THERE'S A MILLION-TO-ONE CHANCE OF A MIX-UP. THE ARMY IS VERY CAREFUL. - BUT ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN ON A BATTLEFIELD, YOU AS MUCH AS SAID SO. - FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, MR. TIBBETTS-- - LIEUTENANT, WHY DON'T YOU GO INSIDE, KEEP YOUNG LONNIE AND THE LADIES COMPANY. LEAVE JAKE AND ME TO REASON THINGS OUT HERE. - YES, SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR. - JAKE, WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? WHY CAN'T YOU EVER JUST LEAVE THINGS BE? YOU'VE HEARD HIM. IT MAY NOT BE HENRY IN THAT BOX AT ALL. - SO WHAT IF IT'S NOT? A MILLION-TO-ONE THE LIEUTENANT SAID, BUT JUST SUPPOSE, FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT IT'S NOT, THE DEAD HAVE NO NAMES, JAKE. BURY HIM AND BE DONE WITH IT. - BUT I HAVE TO KNOW. - WHY? WHY DO YOU HAVE TO KNOW? - I HAVE TO PUT HIM TO REST. - YOU NEVER SEEMED TO CARE BEFORE. - YOU KNOW WHAT HENRY WAS LIKE. - JAKE, ONLY A MAN OF YOUR OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION COULD EVEN CONCEIVE A THING LIKE THIS. IT'S INSANE. EVEN THE MENTION OF IT WOULD GRIEVE PASTINE. THINK OF HER, IF NOTHING ELSE. HELL, THE BOY'S DEAD, JAKE. DON'T TOTE HIS GHOST. - A BRAVE MAN, A HERO, WHO REMINDS US IN DEATH THAT GOD USES US IN STRANGE AND WONDERFUL AND MYSTERIOUS WAYS. HENRY TIBBETTS GAVE HIS COUNTRY THE LAST FULL MEASURE OF DEVOTION. WE RECALL THE WORDS OF THE PSALMIST WHO SAID, "I WILL LIFT UP MINE EYES UNTO THE HILLS FROM WHENCE COMETH MY STRENGTH." - HONOR GUARD, ATTENTION! READY! AIM! FIRE! [gunfire] READY! AIM! FIRE! [gunfire] READY! AIM! FIRE! HONOR GUARD, ORDER ARMS. [Tapsplaying] â™ª â™ª â™ª â™ª - AND NOW WE COMMIT THE BODY OF OUR SON-- - STOP RIGHT THERE. COME ON. THE WHOLE MESS OF YOU, MOVE AWAY FROM HERE. COME ON, BACK, YOU HEAR ME? - JAKE, JAKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - COME ON, COME ON, START MOVING. COME ON. YOU HEAR ME, SOLDIER? GET MOVING THERE. COME ON. - YES, SIR. - BACK! [gunshot and screams] - JAKE TIBBETTS, YOU GIVE ME THAT GUN NOW, OR YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. - HILTON, YOU'RE NOT ARRESTING ANYONE WITHOUT A PISTOL. [gunshot and screams] - ROSH, DO SOMETHING. - JAKE, DON'T DO THIS. IT'S SACRILEGE. - MAYBE SO, BUT I GOT TO DO IT ANYWAY. LIEUTENANT, HAVE YOU GOT THAT KEY YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT? - YES, SIR. - LONNIE, YOU TAKE YOUR MAMA PASTINE AND FRANCINE OVER YONDER WITH YOU. GO ON, GET MOVING. [car horn honks] ALL RIGHT, LIEUTENANT, GET BUSY. [car horn honks] - IT'S DONE. - OPEN IT. - MR. TIBBETTS, PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME-- - I SAID OPEN IT. ROSH, COME SEE. - SON, YOU GO TELL THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TO COME GET THIS POOR BOY WHOEVER HE IS. IT'S NOT HENRY TIBBETTS. [body thuds] - MAMA PASTINE? MAMA PASTINE? - YOU GOT COMPANY, MR NEWSPAPERMAN YOUR LAWYER'S HERE - HOW ARE YOU, JAKE? - PENITENT. - MM. YEAH. BROUGHT YOU A PAPER. AND A LITTLE SOMETHING. - AH WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW LISTEN TO THIS, METHODIST SERMON AND RECEIPE FOR CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP ON THE FRONT PAGE. WHO DID THAT? - PASTINE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SERMON OF THE SOUP. SHE WANTED TO SUSPEND PUBLICATION 'TIL YOU GOT OUT OF JAIL, BUT LONNIE TALKED HERINTO GETTING OUT AN ISSUE. NOTHING IN HERE ABOUT THAT BUSINESS OF HENRY AND THE CASKET. - WAR DEPARTMENT IS TURNING EUROPE UPSIDE-DOWN I'M TOLD. SO FAR NOTHING. - YEAH, ANYONE COME TO SEE ME? - WELL, I'M HERE. OTHERWISE I BELIEVE THE WORDS PASTINE USED WERE, "LET HIM ROT." - YEAH, STILL MAD? - HMM, I THINK HUMILIATED COMES CLOSER TO IT. - WELL, I WAS RIGHT. IT WASN'T HENRY. WHY CAN'T ANY OF YOU ADMIT FOR ONCE I'M RIGHT - YOU KNOW IN A STRANGE WAY,I THINK FOLKS GENERALLY ADMIRE WHAT YOU DID AT THE CEMETERY, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT TURNED OUT THE WAY IT DID. AS FOR ME, I THINK IT WAS AN OBSCENE ACT. - , ROSH, PLEASE. - YOU TALK ABOUT TAKING YOUR LIFE IN YOUR OWN HANDS AND SHAKING IT FOR ALL IT'S WORTH, AND THAT'S FINE, EXCEPT THAT YOU TRAMPLE ALL OVER THE REST OF US. HAS IT EVER OCCURRED TO YOU THAT WHILE YOU'RE BUSY DIGGING UP YOUR OWN DEAD YOU'RE UN-- YOU'RE UNCOVERING A LOT OF OTHER BONES? - I'M SORRY, ROSH. I DIDN'T MEAN IT - DOES TO ME, I CAN FORGIVE IF NOT FORGET BUT WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO PASTINE-- - PASTINE NEEDED TO KNOW TOO - AND WHAT DOES SHE KNOW? HENRY'S STILL DEAD, BUT HE'S NOT BURIED. SHE MAY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS WHOLE THING AGAIN. - YOU--YOU AND PASTINE, SHE'S THE ONE YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT, ISN'T IT YOU NEVER GOT OVER IT DID YOU ROSH ROSH, I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN IT, ROSH. I NEVER MET TO HURT ANYONE. - DADDY JAKE, THEY WOULDN'T LET ME IN TO SEE YOU. -NO , I GUESS THEY DIDN'T-- MY DADDY IS ALIVE. [dog barking] - WHAT? - MAMA PASTINE GOT A CALL THIS MORNING. THEY FOUND HIM IN A HOSPITAL IN EUROPE. THEY SAID HE'D BEEN HURT BAD IN THE HEAD, FORGOT WHO HE WAS. AND THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE DOG TAGS GETTING MIXED UP. - HENRY. [metal scraping] [baby cooing] - I JUST HEARD. LONNIE CAME OVER AND TOLD ME. PASTINE? - MY BOY IS COMING HOME. - I KNOW. - LET ME TELL YOU THIS, JAKE, AND HEAR ME WELL. IF THINGS HADN'T TURNED OUT THIS WAY, I WOULD'VE LEFT YOU. - YOU WOULDN'T. - YES, I WOULD. AND I STILL MAY. I PUT YOUR THINGS IN LONNIE'S ROOM. - FOR HOW LONG? - THAT DEPENDS. - ON WHAT? - ON YOU AND HENRY. ROSH WAS BY A LITTLE WHILE AGO, JAKE. HE JUST GOT A CALL TOO. BILLY'S MISSING IN ACTION. [gentle music] â™ª - WE INTERRUPT THIS PROGRAM FOR A SPECIAL NEWS BULLETIN. I'M GONNA SWITCH YOU TO WASHINGTON, DC. - IT'S OVER. - WHAT'S OVER? - THE WAR. IT'S OVER IN EUROPE. THE GERMANS SURRENDERED THIS MORNING. I JUST HEARD IT ON THE RADIO. - I'M GLAD. IT'S BEEN A LONG WAR FOR ALL OF US. I'M TIRED OF FIGHTING. - WHERE ARE YOU GOING? - OVER TO BISCUIT'S. IT'S NOT OFFICIAL UNTIL YOU HEAR IT AT BISCUIT'S. [bells tolling] - RUSSIAN ARMED FORCES, EAST GERMAN OFFICERS SURRENDERED UNCONDITIONALLY IN A CEREMONY-- [horn honks] GENERAL JODL, THE LAST CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE DISSOLVING GERMAN ARMY ASKED THE VICTORS TO TREAT THE GERMANS WITH GENEROSITY. - BULL. WE OUGHT TO LINE 'EM UP AND SHOOT 'EM ALL. - NO TIME FOR THAT. WE GOT TO GET ON WITH WHIPPIN' THE JAPS. SOME OF US HAVE GOT BOYS OUT THERE TOO.
