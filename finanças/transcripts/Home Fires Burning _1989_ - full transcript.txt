YOU GOT TO SIT THERE AND SEE YOUR GRANDFATHER, THE MAYOR, DELIVER THE FOURTH OF JULY SPEECH AND WATCH YOUR GRANDFATHER, THE EDITOR, TAKE A NAP IN THE AUDIENCE. - YEAH. I'M JUST GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

THIS NEWS BULLETIN BY THE WAY IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY REDLINGER'S FUNERAL HOME. - YOU ALL RIGHT? - OF COURSE I AM. IT'S ONE OF OURS. IT'S A STEARMAN PT-17, A TRAINING PLANE.

WON'T YOU COME? - NO. BUT YOU'RE WONDERFUL. COME BACK WHEN THE WAR IS OVER. - I GUESS I MESSED UP. - HOW LONG ARE YOU OVERDUE AT YOUR BASE? - LESS THAN AN HOUR. I'M ON A CROSS-COUNTRY. - I'LL SEE IF I CAN FIX IT. [uplifting music] - WHO'S THAT? COME BACK. COME BACK. COME BACK. - Y'ALL DIDN'T ALL HAVE TO COME GET ME. YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT I WAS A PARADE OR SOMETHIN'. - YOU JUST HUSH UP, MR. SMARTY-PANTS. WITH ALL THE COMMOTION YOU CAUSED TODAY, I THINK YOU'LL BE PRAYING FOR YOUR MORTAL SOUL, OR AT LEAST THE SEAT OF YOUR BRITCHES. - WHO'S THAT ON THE STEPS? - MAY WE HELP YOU? - ARE YOU THE TIBBETTS? - WHY? - WELL, I'M FRANCINE TIBBETTS, HENRY'S WIFE, AND I'M ABOUT TO HAVE HIS BABY ON YOUR STEPS. - JAKE, CALL THE DOCTOR. ROSH, YOU AND LONNIE GET HER THINGS. COME ON, LET'S GET YOU UPSTAIRS. WE DON'T NEED ANY BABIES BORN ON THE FRONT STEPS. - HOLY COW, A BABY. GOSH, CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? DOES THAT MAKE ME AN UNCLE? - NO, THAT MAKES YOU A BROTHER. THE BABY WILL BE YOUR FATHER'S CHILD, JUST LIKE YOU ARE. - GEE. CAN I CALL UP UNCLE BRUNSON TO TELL HIM I'M GONNA BE A BROTHER? - UH, JUST A MINUTE, LONNIE. JAKE, DON'T YOU WANNA CALL THE DOCTOR FIRST? - NO. - JAKE, DON'T BE DIFFICULT. - IT'S HENRY, PULLING ANOTHER ONE OF HIS TRICKS. HE'S BEEN DOING IT SINCE HE WAS BORN. - IS HE ON THE WAY? DID YOU CALL THE DOCTOR? - HOW DO WE KNOW THAT SHE'S HENRY'S WIFE? - SHE'S HIS WIFE, ALL RIGHT. SHE'S GOT A MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE. HER NAME USED TO BE FRANCINE WALCZYNSKI, AND SHE'S FROM CLEVELAND, OHIO. THEY WERE MARRIED IN TEXAS BEFORE HE SHIPPED OUT. - JUST LIKE HIM. GETTING A WOMAN IN TROUBLE AND THEN LIGHTING OUT FOR EUROPE. - LONNIE, HOW ABOUT WE GO OUTSIDE FOR A WHILE, HUH? - JAKE, YOU'VE GONE FAR ENOUGH. YOU CAN DISOWN HENRY BUT NOT HIS WIFE AND CHILD. YOU CALL THE DOCTOR OR GET OUT. YOU'RE A HARD AND STUBBORN MAN. NOW GET OUT. I'LL CALL THE DOCTOR. WE CAN DO WITHOUT YOU. - I WILL NOT. - YOU WILL NOT? - I WILL NOT! - ALL RIGHT THEN. OH. YOU GET OUT, OR I'LL CUT YOUR HEAD OFF. - NOW, LOOK, PUT THAT DOWN, PASTINE. PASTINE, PUT DOWN THAT SWORD BEFORE YOU HURT YOURSELF--AH! YOU KNOW-- - NO YOU DON'T, JAKE, DON'T START IN WITH YOUR WORDS. YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND YOUR FEET MOVIN'. COME ON! COME ON! - PUT THAT DOWN. YOU HEAR ME? COME ON! COME ON! STOP THAT! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU ANYWAY? NOBODY'S GONNA RUN ME OUT OF MY OWN HOME WITH MY OWN GRANDFATHER'S SWORD. YOU COULD'VE CUT MY HEAD OFF! YOU SEE WHAT SHE DID? - JAKE, I DON'T THINK YOU OUGHT TO TRY GETTING BACK IN THERE AGAIN. NOW, LET'S JUST GET OURSELVES ORGANIZED AND TALK THIS THING OUT LIKE SENSIBLE FOLKS. - YOU CALL THAT SENSIBLE? - I CALL THAT PRETTY PERSUASIVE. - THEN WHAT AM I GONNA DO IF I CAN'T GET BACK INTO MY OWN HOUSE? - STAY AT THE NEWSPAPER. TALK TO YOUR TYPEWRITER. YOU'RE AN ARBITRARY OLD FOOL, JAKE. YOU HAVE NO MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS IN YOU, NOT WHERE YOUR SON IS CONCERNED. - ALL RIGHT, PASTINE. IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT IT. CAN I HAVE MY HAT? - UH-HUH. [door slams] - YOU THINK I'M AN ARBITRARY OLD FOOL TOO? - 'BOUT SOME THINGS, YES. - 'BOUT HENRY? - THAT, MOSTLY. - YOU KNOW, I FORGAVE HIM FOR A LOT. - MAYBE NOT ENOUGH. - DON'T TELL ME THAT YOU FORGAVE HIM? AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TO HAZEL? - I DIDN'T FORGIVE OR NOT FORGIVE, JAKE. I JUST GOT ON WITH THINGS. - YEAH. I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO. JUST GET ON WITH THINGS. [grumbles] - AND I HEAR SHE NEARBY CUT HIS HEAD OFF WITH THAT SWORD THEY KEEP OVER THE FIREPLACE. - WELL, DID THE WOMAN HAVE THE BABY? - YES, SHE HAD A LITTLE GIRL. OLD DOC AMESWORTH WAS BY HERE A LITTLE WHILE AGO. HE SAYS, "YOU TAKE ONE LOOK AT HER, AND YOU CAN SURE TELL SHE'S HENRY'S." [laughter] - HEY, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW JAKE HANDLES THIS WHOLE THING IN THE PAPER. YOU DON'T RECKON HE'LL PUT IT ON THE SOCIETY PAGES? - [clears throat] - GOOD MORNING, GENTS. all: GOOD MORNING, JAKE. - LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED TO ME YESTERDAY. - YEAH. - OH, COME ON, JAKE. DON'T TAKE ALL THE FUN OUT OF IT. - YEAH, YEAH. I IMAGINE YOU HEARD THE WHOLE THING ALREADY WITH EMBELLISHMENTS. AND MY VERSION WILL BE DULL BY COMPARISON. WELL, NEEDLESS TO SAY, IF PASTINE'S ARM HAD JUST BEEN A TAD BIT LONGER, I'D BE SITTING HERE HEADLESS. [laughter] ANYWAY, I COULD EAT A HORSE. - COMING UP. - I HEARD CALVIN GOING ON THE RADIO LAST NIGHT. HE SAID SOON AS OUR BOYS BREAK OUT OF NORMANDY, IT'S ALL OVER. JUST A QUESTION OF HOW QUICK THEY CAN GET TO BERLIN. - OUR BOYS ARE GONNA BE HOME BEFORE LONG, YOU'LL SEE. WE'LL GET EVERYTHING BACK TO NORMAL. - THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS NORMAL ANYMORE. WAR'S CHANGED ALL THAT. - I WONDER IF IT'S GONNA BE SAFE. I MEAN, ALL THOSE BOYS, TRAINED KILLERS? WE DON'T KNOW WHAT COMBATS DONE TO 'EM. YOU COULD HAVE A YOUNG FELLA STANDING ON THE STREET CORNER, AND SUDDENLY A CAR BACKFIRES, AND HE GRABS THE NEAREST GUN, STARTS SHOOTING. - INSTEAD OF WORRYING ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT, WHY DON'T WE SPEND SOME TIME THINKING ABOUT A PROPER MEMORIAL? - WE GOT NO BUSINESS PUTTIN' UP A WAR MEMORIAL. - THEM THAT FIGHT GET TO MEMORIALIZE. ME AND MY NEWSPAPER ARE DEAD SET AGAINST IT. - DADDY JAKE? - YEAH? - I BRUNG YOU SOME STUFF. IT'S UNDERWEAR MOSTLY. - UNDERWEAR? - YES, SIR. MAMA PASTINE SAYS, IF YOU DON'T CHANGE YOUR UNDERWEAR REGULAR, YOU'LL GET THE DRY ROT. - WELL, WHAT'S THIS? - IT'S A BIRTHDAY PRESENT. - CAN I OPEN IT? - SURE. I COULDN'T FIND ANY RIBBON, SO I JUST USED SOME STRING. - WELL, NOW, LET ME SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE. WELL, MY FAVORITE BRAND. THANK YOU. - YOU'RE WELCOME. I BOUGHT IT WITH MY OWN MONEY. - WELL, OF COURSE. WELL, THIS IS A SPLENDID GESTURE. I'LL HAVE ONE OF THESE WITH MY SUPPER TONIGHT. WHEREVER IT IS I'M GONNA HAVE MY SUPPER TONIGHT. MAMA PASTINE KNOW YOU'RE HERE? - NO, SIR. I HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE FOR A WHILE. THAT BABY DON'T DO NOTHING BUT SQUALL. - OH, LONNIE, ABOUT-- ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY... I-I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. I LOVE YOUR GRANDMOTHER. SHE'S PUT UP WITH ME FOR A GOOD MANY YEARS. SHE JUST GOT--GOT OVERWROUGHT. - YOU'RE GONNA LIVE HERE? - NO, CERTAINLY NOT. THIS IS A NEWSPAPER OFFICE, NOT A BOARDING HOUSE. LORD KNOWS IF SHE DOESN'T COME DOWN AND HELP ME WITH THE BOOKS THIS WEEK LIKE SHE ALWAYS DOES, I'M A DOOMED MAN. - I'D HELP YOU. - WELL, I KNOW YOU WOULD, BOY, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT MYSELF, MUCH LESS TEACH ANYBODY. - WELL, YOU COULD TEACH ME ABOUT PRINTING. I COULD HELP YOU GET OUT THE PAPER. - OH, YOU WANNA BE A NEWSPAPERMAN? - I RECKON I'D LIKE TO TRY. - WELL, IT'S HONORABLE WORK. MAYBE THE MOST HONORABLE THERE IS. IT HELPS IF YOU HAVE A THICK SKIN, HEAD LIKE A MULE, A LITTLE IMAGINATION. THIS NEWSPAPER HAS USED UP TWO GENERATIONS OF TIBBETTS MEN. SOMETIMES IT EATS MY INSIDES OUT. YOU GO HOME AND ASK YOUR MAMA PASTINE. AND IF SHE SAYS IT'S OKAY, WELL, THEN IT'S OKAY. [chuckles] - [hums] [baby crying] - THE LITTLE BOOGER DON'T DO NOTHING BUT HOLLER. IT'S LIKE LIVING INSIDE A FIRE STATION. - THAT'S NOT A LITTLE BOOGER, LONNIE. THAT'S YOUR SISTER. - HALF-SISTER. - IT'S THE SAME THING. - NOT TO ME IT AIN'T, MY BEAUTY. - DON'T YOU SASS ME, YOUNG MAN. - YES'M. OH, I HAVE SOMETHING TO ASK YOU. COULD IT BE OKAY-- - GOOD HEAVENS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF BED? HERE, COME UP AND SIT DOWN. THIS IS LONNIE, HENRY'S BOY. - NICE TO MEET YA. [machine whirring] [knock at door] - ROSH? - I BROUGHT YOU A COT FROM THE FIRE STATION. WELL, YOU GONNA HELP ME, OR AM I GONNA HAVE TO TOTE THIS THING THE REST OF THE WAY IN BY MYSELF? I AM TOO OLD AND TOO FAT FOR HONEST WORK. AND I NEED A DRINK. - WELL, I'M BUSY. I GOTTA GET A NEWSPAPER OUT. I'M NOT LIKE A LAWYER. POST OFFICE DOESN'T GRANT POSTPONEMENTS. - DRINK NOW. SPREAD WISDOM LATER. - YOUR HEALTH, SIR. - AND YOURS, SIR. MUST BE FAIRLY GOOD WHISKEY. WE'VE DRUNK ENOUGH OF IT IN OUR TIME. - YEAH, I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY WE CALLED IT LIGHTNING JIM'S BEST. IS THERE A LIGHTNING JIM'S WORST? - IF THERE IS, I HOPE IT NEVER PASSES MY LIPS. IF IT WERE ANY WORSE, IT'D PROBABLY KILL US. - SOONER OR LATER, SOMETHING WILL. - I SUPPOSE IT'S BETTER THAN GETTING STRUNG UP. - OH, THINK THAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO ME? - YEAH, SOMETIMES YOU WEAR THIS NEWSPAPER LIKE A HAIR SHIRT, JAKE. - IT MAKES PEOPLE THINK. - OH, LORD KNOWS YOU DO THAT. YOU'VE BEEN A BURR UNDER THIS TOWN'S SADDLE FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER, AND GENERALLY WE'RE BETTER OFF FOR IT. BUT THIS TIME FOLKS THINK YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR. OH, IF I HAD TO WORRY ABOUT GOING TOO FAR, I'D NEVER PRINT ANYTHING EXCEPT SOCIETY NEWS AND THE CLASSIFIED ADS. I DECIDED A LONG TIME AGO THAT A MAN HAS TO TAKE HIS LIFE IN HIS OWN TWO HANDS AND SHAKE IT FOR ALL ITS WORTH. EVERYONE ELSE CAN DO THEIR OWN SHAKING. - I JUST WISH YOU BELIEVED IT. - WHAT? - YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT A MAN TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIMSELF. IF YOU DID, YOU WOULDN'T CARRY OTHER FOLKS' GUILT AROUND IN A PEDDLER'S SACK. YOU'D LET THEM DO THEIR OWN TOTING. - OH, YOU MEAN HENRY? I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT HENRY SINCE HE GOT DRUNK AND JOINED THE NATIONAL GUARD FOUR YEARS AGO. - YOU PUT ON A BIG SHOW, JAKE. YOU DISOWN HIM, BUT YOU CARRY HENRY AROUND ON YOUR SHOULDERS TRYING NOT TO LET THE REST OF US SEE HOW IT MAKES YOU STOOP. - DO YOU THINK I OUGHT TO FORGET WHAT HENRY DID? YOU OF ALL PEOPLE? - YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID. NOBODY KNOWS HOW IT HAPPENED, NOT EVEN HENRY. - I KNOW HE WAS DRIVIN'. AND HE FLED LIKE A COWARD. - ALL I KNOW IS WHAT IT'S DONE TO YOU, MY FRIEND. - BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, ROSH, I'M NOT GONNA PRINT A WORD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH BILLY AND THAT AIRPLANE. YOU WON THIS ONE. BUT THIS NEWSPAPER IS OPPOSED TO A WAR MEMORIAL. - I SHALL NOW LEAVE YOU, MY DEAR FRIEND. SLEEP TIGHT, SWEET PRINCE. [door opens and shuts] - MAMA PASTINE? - HMM? - I WANT YOU TO TELL ME ABOUT MY DADDY. - WHAT DO YOU WANNA KNOW? - EVERYTHING. YOU NEVER TOLD ME ANYTHING. NOBODY HAS. - OH, LONNIE, IT'S NOT ANYTHING YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT. - YOU THINK I'M TOO YOUNG. I'M ALMOST 14 YEARS OLD. IT'S TIME YOU TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED. MY MOTHER WAS KILLED IN THE WRECK. - YES. YOU WERE FOUR. - HOW'D IT HAPPEN? - NOBODY REALLY KNOWS. THE CAR RAN OFF THE ROAD SOMEHOW. YOUR FATHER WAS THROWN FREE. HE COULDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING AFTERWARD. - THEN WHAT HAPPENED? - HE WAS VERY SAD. WHEN SHE DIED, WELL, HE JUST NEVER GOT OVER IT. - WELL, WHY IS DADDY JAKE MAD AT HIM? IS IT ABOUT THE WRECK? - PARTLY, BUT IT GOES A LONG WAY BACK. YOUR FATHER WAS A DIFFICULT CHILD, ALWAYS HARD TO MANAGE. I THINK HE AND YOUR GRANDFATHER ARE JUST TOO MUCH ALIKE. THEY TRIED, BUT THEY JUST NEVER COULD SEEM TO... PLEASE EACH OTHER. AND THEN THE WRECK. WELL, JAKE BLAMED HENRY, AND HENRY NEVER WOULD DEFEND HIMSELF. THEY JUST SEEMED TO LOSE TOUCH. AND THAT'S WHY YOU CAME TO STAY WITH US. - I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE YOU SAD. I LOVE YOU. AND I LOVE DADDY JAKE TOO. - OF COURSE YOU DO. SO DO I. HE'S A CANTANKEROUS OLD GOAT, BUT I LOVE HIM IN SPITE OF IT. THAT'S WHAT MARRIAGE IS, SOMETIMES, "LOVIN' IN SPITE OF." DOES THIS HELP, ANY OF THIS? - OH, YES, MA'AM. I JUST WANNA KNOW WHO MY DADDY IS. THEN I COULD THINK ABOUT HIM. MAMA PASTINE! DADDY JAKE'S COMIN' HOME. - DON'T BOTHER TO SET FOOT UNLESS YOU COME TO MAKE AMENDS, JAKE. - PASTINE, HENRY'S DEAD. [baby crying] - HE'S BEEN DEAD TO YOU FOR YEARS. - OH, PLEASE, PASTINE, DON'T. NO, HE HASN'T BEEN DEAD TO ME. YOU CAN'T BE ANGRY WITH A DEAD MAN. - BUT YOU CUT HIM OUT OF YOUR LIFE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T MEASURE UP. - I TRIED TO CUT HIM OUT, BUT I COULDN'T. ROSH TOLD ME THE OTHER DAY THAT I'VE BEEN CARRYING HENRY AROUND ON MY BACK. MAYBE WHAT I'VE BEEN REALLY CARRYING IS FAILURE. AND I HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT. - YES, YOU WILL. WE BOTH HAVE TO LIVE WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT LEFT. YOU'VE GOT YOUR NEWSPAPER. - OUR NEWSPAPER. - OH, NO. I'M THROUGH WITH THAT. - OH, PLEASE, PASTINE. I CAN'T MANAGE WITHOUT YOU. THE BOOKS ARE A WRECK. - CAN I HELP? I CAN KEEP BOOKS. WENT TO BUSINESS SCHOOL. GUESS I NEED TO START EARNING MY KEEP. - DON'T YOU EVER FEEL THAT. YOU BELONG HERE. NOW MORE THAN EVER. - YEAH, YOU'RE WELCOME TO TRY IF YOU WANNA. - FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. [indistinct chatter] - I GUESS IT'S ABOUT TIME. ALMOST 10:00. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? - NO, I'M NOT ALL RIGHT. AM I GONNA MAKE IT THROUGH THE DAY? YES, I AM. - WHERE'S JAKE? - I THINK HE'S OUT BACK WITH LT. WHALEN, THE YOUNG MAN WHO BROUGHT THE CASKET HOME. WHY DON'T YOU GO GET HIM? - ALL RIGHT. - WHERE'S LONNIE? - RIGHT HERE, MAMA PASTINE. - I WANT YOU TO BE PROUD OF YOUR FATHER TODAY. AND I WANT HIM TO BE PROUD OF YOU. - YES, MA'AM. I'LL BE OKAY. - I REALLY CAN'T, MR. TIBBETTS. I'M SORRY. - BUT COULD YOU, IF YOU HAD TO. - IF I HAD TO. BUT YOU NEED AN ORDER FROM A HEALTH OFFICIAL. YOU--YOU JUST CAN'T TAKE IT UPON YOURSELF TO DO THAT SORT OF THING. - JAKE, LIEUTENANT, ANYTHING WRONG? - NO, SIR. - I'VE BEEN ASKING THE LIEUTENANT HOW HE KNEW THAT IT WAS HENRY IN THERE. BOTTOM LINE IS, HE DOESN'T. - HUH? WHAT I SAID WAS--IS THERE'S A MILLION-TO-ONE CHANCE OF A MIX-UP. THE ARMY IS VERY CAREFUL. - BUT ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN ON A BATTLEFIELD, YOU AS MUCH AS SAID SO. - FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, MR. TIBBETTS-- - LIEUTENANT, WHY DON'T YOU GO INSIDE, KEEP YOUNG LONNIE AND THE LADIES COMPANY. LEAVE JAKE AND ME TO REASON THINGS OUT HERE. - YES, SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR. - JAKE, WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? WHY CAN'T YOU EVER JUST LEAVE THINGS BE? YOU'VE HEARD HIM. IT MAY NOT BE HENRY IN THAT BOX AT ALL. - SO WHAT IF IT'S NOT? A MILLION-TO-ONE THE LIEUTENANT SAID, BUT JUST SUPPOSE, FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT IT'S NOT, THE DEAD HAVE NO NAMES, JAKE. BURY HIM AND BE DONE WITH IT. - BUT I HAVE TO KNOW. - WHY? WHY DO YOU HAVE TO KNOW? - I HAVE TO PUT HIM TO REST. - YOU NEVER SEEMED TO CARE BEFORE. - YOU KNOW WHAT HENRY WAS LIKE. - JAKE, ONLY A MAN OF YOUR OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION COULD EVEN CONCEIVE A THING LIKE THIS. IT'S INSANE. EVEN THE MENTION OF IT WOULD GRIEVE PASTINE. THINK OF HER, IF NOTHING ELSE. HELL, THE BOY'S DEAD, JAKE. DON'T TOTE HIS GHOST. - A BRAVE MAN, A HERO, WHO REMINDS US IN DEATH THAT GOD USES US IN STRANGE AND WONDERFUL AND MYSTERIOUS WAYS. HENRY TIBBETTS GAVE HIS COUNTRY THE LAST FULL MEASURE OF DEVOTION.
