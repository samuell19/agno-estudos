I've got woman, a victim of a hit-and-run. Struck by a car in a residential area. Unconscious. Blood pressure dropping. Possible femur fracture. Belly's distended, possible internal bleeding. See if she was too quiet. I'll blame you. -Take it easy. -Is she responding to anything? -No response. -Last blood pressure reading? Joey took her last pressure reading in the rig, 72 over 30. Okay we're probably going to have to intubate. I'll grab the airway kit and have someone call respiratory. Right away. Elisha! Baby, baby, baby. No, no, no! Elisha! Baby, baby, baby, no, no, no! -No, no, no! -I need another doctor now! Elisha! Gimme two. Just one for me. All in, Thomas. I'm really regretting we didn't play strip poker instead. I'll call. Then you'd be leaving butt ass naked. God! Gotta get to work. Dead bodies wait for no woman. Okay, Jordan, at least tell me why you won't go out with me. Thomas, you're a forensics profiler at Quantico. You haven't figured that out by now? I can't believe that you were the keynote speaker for the Forensic Pathologists Conference yesterday and then proceeded to wipe us all out in marathon rounds of five card draw. You're unbelievable, you know that. Who better to fleece than a conference full of arrogant doctors and data nerds who tried to grab the keynote speaker's ass all week? Touché, Dr. Touissant, but at least in my defense, it is a very cute ass. I'm just wondering when I'm gonna get you back in my bed? Thomas... you have a special set of skills that I'm quite fond of. And we had fun for a couple of months. But that's all it was. Just give us a chance. We agreed that we're better off as cordial colleagues and rival poker players. Although, you're not really a rival anymore. After last night, you're more like a mark. Oh, damn! That's vicious, you're vicious. I gotta take this. Okay. When I finished, all right? Hello, it's Dr. Touissant. Jordan, it's Tamera. Tamera? Jordan, you need to come home. -It's Elisha... -What? She's dead. What? This is so surreal. I-I can't believe she's gone. Did you catch the driver? Um, sorry, Doc, I don't have any updates just yet. Mrs. Harrington and Dr. Harrington, I just wanted to come by and extend my sincere condolences on behalf of myself and the entire New Orleans Police Department. Thank you, Chief Lewellyn. Miles, baby, would you excuse us for a moment? -Okay. -I love you, baby. Police chief at a repast? What do you think that was about? Oh, it's been a week. The police still haven't caught the hit-and-run driver that killed Elisha. And I so imagine Mrs. Brenda Grace Harrington... she is putting her Louboutin firmly in the chief's grits-and-gravy ass. Do they have any leads? It's like Elisha was hit by a ghost. Who found her? A neighbor, out walking his dog, found her on the side of the road. Where was Miles? At the hospital. Isn't he the emergency room chief? Why was he there that late? I don't know, Earl called for an ambulance as soon as he found her. Girl, with this zip code, they came in a matter of minutes. But by the time they got her to the hospital, they just... couldn't do nothing for her. I thought you quit? Haven't touched one since Bill died. I thought you quit? My liver quit a long time ago. That's why I only drink on Tuesdays and Thursdays and when the Saints lose. He's a good man, Bill Harrington. Made a damn fine whiskey. Yes. Yes, he did. But unlike my family's bourbon... Bill was weak. Didn't have the balls to do the things that needed to be done to protect his family. Well, lucky for me... I got balls bigger than the state of Louisiana. That you do, Mrs. Harrington. That you do. Now, Chief... how big are your balls? Whoa, Brenda Grace! What the hell... Tell me, Chief. What's going on with the investigation into my daughter-in-law's death? I told you, we're working around the clock... and we won't rest until the driver of that car is found. If you want to stay chief, you'll see to it that your good ol' boys do their jobs. You will not be city's dog catcher if my poor son doesn't get justice very soon for his beloved wife. God rest her soul. Yes, ma'am. -I'm gonna need that dress. -Say less, sis. That's yours. Matter of fact, I was making Elisha and Brenda Grace's gowns for the Grand Boule gala this year. Yes, come through New Orleans haute couture for the grand dame of the Grand Boule. Your girl went from the bottom to the Boule just in time for my birthday. Although it won't be a happy one this year. That's right. It is almost your birthday. Well... we're gonna celebrate any way. It's what Elisha would've wanted. Yeah, I guess you're right. I feel like I owe you and Elisha an apology. Why would you need to apologize to us? When my mom lost her battle at cancer... I was drowning in grief. And when that job offer from DC to be the City's Medical Examiner came in, I... I grabbed on to it like it was a life preserver I just threw myself into work. I mean, I kept up with you on social media. I saw you killing at fashion game, and Elisha was... running her family's foundation. She finally had the family that... The perfect family she always wanted. Elisha just missed you, you know. -We both did. -She called me. And, uh, I saw that she called, but... I didn't call her back. What did she say? I listened to the message on the plane on the way here and... she sounded like she was worried about something. Oh, you can't. You can't worry about that now, I mean... Maybe she was stressed about the Boule. Brenda Grace want to make it bigger and better every year. Kick off of the season. That would stress anybody out, huh, girl? It didn't seem like it was about work. Hey, Jordan, it-it's Elisha. Wow, I feel like I haven't talked to you in forever. Can you call me back when you get this message? I need some advice. You're the only one I can trust right now. Please, call me back. See? Doesn't it seem like she was worried about something serious? -I don't-- -Tamera. Mother would like to speak with you about the Grand Boule. Sure, Miles. Love you. That Harrington bitch is on my ass like a gator in chicken coop. So that means I'm on yours. Here. Spread that around and find the driver of that car, you hear? Coming! Oh, my God! I totally forgot you're coming today. Um... You know, I haven't decided what I'm gonna keep for staging. But, you know, you guys can just come on in. You know what, why don't you guys start upstairs and I'll just meet you in a second? Hey, morning, beautiful. Just checking on you. How was the service? Elisha's homegoing was lovely. But they still haven't caught the driver that killed Elisha. What are the police saying? Not enough. Can you hold on a second? My officers are pursuing several leads. The New Orleans police department will not rest until this callous killer is brought to justice. Look, I'm sorry to bother you so early, but I need to confirm if you're coming to Quantico on Monday. You're supposed to be giving your Racial Bias in Forensic Pathology and Criminal Testimony talk to the new class of agents. And they're excited to meet DC's chief medical examiner. -Monday? -Yeah. You're still planning on coming back at the end of the week, right? Yes. I, um, I just forgot. Hey, it's okay. I know you got a lot on your mind right now. Yeah. In addition to processing Elisha's death, I am trying to deal with my parent's town home. The people that I hired to get it ready are actually here. Right now. Jordan, will you please let me know if you need any help? You need not have to do this all on your own. I can be there in a New Orleans minute. Yeah, thank you. I appreciate you. No problem, precious. I'm sorry about that. Um, where should we start? -I don't know what to say. -Just say, "Yes." It would mean so much to me and, frankly, Miles. And I think that's what your dear mother would want also. How I so miss Claire's friendship. It's just that I was scheduled to leave on Friday. Well, surely you can extend your stay in New Orleans, for your mother's dearest and oldest friend. And besides, Jordan, it's for Elisha. Of course I can extend my stay. I-I would be honored. Oh, bless your heart, Jordan. But this calls for a toast. Cheers to the Grand Boule. To the Boule. Oh, well, looky here! If it isn't Jordan Touissant, as I live and breathe. Oh! Sully, you know I couldn't come home without stopping by this office. And is that box of beignets a gift for your old boss? Mm-hm, only the best from Filene's for the man that gave this college student the internship of a lifetime, and a job after graduation. Well, you remember, you wouldn't stop hanging around. I had to give you a job to stop Esther from thinking I was having an affair. Please give Esther my best and tell her I still miss her jambalaya. I certainly will do that. So, how's DC treating you? It's good, you know, busy. I hear a "but" in your voice. Is the beltway not all that you thought it would be? Uh, it's not that... But I guess it's just not New Orleans. Doesn't feel like home yet. Well, after 30 years with Esther, I can tell you from experience until you find someone special it never will be. And what makes you think I haven't found someone special? There's no ring on that finger. You know, in addition to my career in DC, I have you to thank for my repertoire of forensic pathologist jokes. I kill at conferences. Do you know why the best forensic teams can never catch hillbilly criminals? Why, Sully? 'Cause they all share the same DNA and there ain't no doggone dental records. Don't quit your day job for a, you know, open-mic night. I cannot wait to have these after lunch. I brought you some napkins too. Oh, thank you so much now. Is that Elisha's autopsy? Don't.. I-I'm sorry. That.. That... Sorry, it shouldn't be out. Can I see it? Are you sure you want to do that to yourself? I know how close the two of you were. This just breaks my heart. I'll always regret not seeing her one last time. Excuse me, one second. Sully Dufresne. Yes. Already? All right. Okay, I'll be right out. -Got a body? -Yes. And the lift gate's acting up, so I gotta go out and open it. Don't you touch my beignets. Uh, never. Oh, my God! You want my arm to fall off? What are you doing here? You didn't answer my question. "Do you want my arm to fall off?" You're no Billie Dee Williams. Well, you ain't no Diana Ross from what I can remember after some of our karaoke nights, but I won't hold that against you. But you're still... just as beautiful. -Marcus? -Mm-hm? What are you doing here? I saw you watching us at the funeral. Are you stalking me now? Wow! Someone has developed a mighty high opinion of themselves after breaking up with me and moving all the way to DC for their fancy new job. Hm. And I see you made detective. -Congratulations. -Thank you. Good afternoon, Detective Bardot. -Afternoon, Dr. Dufresne. -Oh, Sully, please. There's no room for formalities amongst the dead. I just came to get the medical examiner's official report on the Elisha Harrington case. You could've called, I would've emailed them over to your office. I just want to make sure I got everything for the chief. You know, high profile case, so we gotta make sure we review every single detail to find that good old driver. -Okay. -So, can I have the photos? -That would be fine? -Oh, um... Well, these aren't those photos. They, um, got mixed up in this other file. Organizational skills have lapsed ever since Delilah went out on maternity leave. You'd think five kids was enough. You know, I had to go to HR after I said to her, "Five kid's not a family, it's litter." Well, you don't have another set in the photo? If not, after your thing, go ahead and print me some more. I can do better for you, detective. Thank you. My, uh, lab printer is not working. And the city won't buy me another one, so... I had to print 'em down the hall. All right, so, I'll just grab 'em... and I'll be right back. Excuse me. I'm really sorry, uh, for what happened to Elisha. Thank you. So, how long are you in town? I was supposed to leave on Friday, but, um... Elisha's mom asked me to stick around for the Grand Boule. -So... -The Grand Boule. So, does that ticket still come with a paper bag test? You know they don't do that anymore. Okay, you're there. -Here you go, Detective. -Oh, thank you. Mm-hm. Marcus, do you mind giving me a ride home? Sure. Sure, sure, sure. I was hoping we gonna continue our visit. I know, I just, I just remembered. I have the plumber coming to look at a leaky pipe. Well, you check in with me before you leave, darlin'. Aw, you know I will. -All right. -Okay. -See you, dear. -Take care. Sully. Come on, got 'em in here. My car's parked around the corner. Jordan, hey, what are you doing? Stop, Jordan. Get... Jordan. There's a photo missing. What photo, Jordan? The photo that shows that Elisha was strangled. I don't know, what do we have here? Oh, my God! Just stop. It was in the cushion. I fell asleep on the couch last night. That's okay. You know I always loved you in lingerie. My lingerie habits stopped being your concern five years ago. Not 'cause I wanted it to. Look. We need to figure out why Sully's hiding the photo that shows that Elisha was strangled. Hm. Are those the pictures that you took? -Yes. -And the missing photo? And those photos, and that voicemail I played for you in the car from Elisha, has all my Spidey senses tingling. Something's not right. Strangulation doesn't really make sense. When the EMTs got to Elisha, she was still alive. She didn't die until after she got to the hospital. And Elisha was examined by her loving husband who just happened to be working at the hospital that night. Pretty convenient alibi, huh? So, what, are you trying to say that Dr. Miles Harrington killed his wife? Fifty-five percent of female homicide victims are killed by an intimate partner, husbands or boyfriends. Isn't the husband always the first suspect? Not when you're a Harrington. Off the rip, the Police Chief was real adamant that we pursue a hit-and-run driver. Miles was never even questioned. Did NOLA PD even check his timeline for the night? According to the hospital key card, that Miles Harrington was conveniently at the hospital at that time that Elisha was murdered. -The key card. -Mm-hm. Did any person actually see him there before his wife arrived? I'll follow up tomorrow and I can check. But if Elisha was strangled, then how was she still alive when she got to the hospital, Dr. Touissant? Okay, detective. Look. Give me your hands. Now... As you apply pressure, the victim will lose consciousness. Depending on the amount of time without oxygen, there could be permanent medical consequences. Stroke or brain damage and obviously death. I think Elisha's attacker was interrupted before he could finish the job. Why does it always have to be a he? Well, without looking at the body, I can't be sure, but judging from these photos, I would bet this townhouse that her attacker was a man. Seems like you're enjoying your job a little bit too much. Hardly. So... are you really going to sell this place? It's time. -Hm. -I'm never here anymore anyway. Yeah, I'm trying to get it on the market before I get back to DC. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Why? Well, because... if you still own this beautiful the place... there's a chance that you'd come back to New Orleans. Back to me. ♪ Smiling on the surface ♪ Deep down are you feeling me ♪ ♪ Baby I'm strong enough ♪ We shouldn't do this. Enjoying the night, eh, now? I didn't realize how much I missed you until I saw you at the cemetery. Marcus... The past is the past. Hm. Excuse me. Let me go... before you do something that you will regret in the morning to make up to something. Good night, doctor. ♪ Baby I'm not strong enough Don't act like you forgot something to try to get me into bed. Ugh! It's not happening. Mind if I come in? Um... I was actually just about to go to bed. Right, so I hear. I'm guessing you were expecting somebody else, right? What can I do for you, Miles? It's pretty late. You okay? Yeah, yeah, um, no, I just, I just left the hospital. You're back at work already? Yeah, yeah, you know, it's... It's the only thing that you know quiets my brains so I'm not thinking about Elisha all day... and catching the bastard who killed her. How's Amaya Grace? She's still asking when her mommy's coming home. Um... I don't think she fully understands what happened. I'm sorry, Miles. I... I know that can't be easy. Elisha, she loved you so much. You were her best friend, right? Yeah. Miles, have you been drinking? Yeah, it's, uh... It's the only thing that gets me through the lonely nights. Tell you the truth, I can't even sleep in my own bed right now. You really shouldn't be driving if you've been drinking. I just came to say thank you, Jordan. "Thank you?" For what? Mother told me that you two had lunch at Gris Gris and that you agreed to be the Grand Boule queen. I, I didn't realize you guys had opened a restaurant. Elisha and I opened a restaurant and lounge just-just last year, you know? She... Man, she wanted something that was just ours, wasn't tied to the family. Anything for Elisha. You know, hey, um, I'll give you a call and we-we can talk about the foundation 'cause I know Elisha, she was really, really proud of the Ninth Ward youth center. -So-- -Sounds good. I, I'll give you a call, Miles. -Okay? -You call. You take care, Miles. Okay. Yeah. -Get home safe. -Thank you. -Bye, Jordan. -Good night. I told you exactly who I need it to be, Dayveon? You get it done. -You're making it complicated. -I can't afford any mistakes. I got you, you ain't gotta worry. I'm just saying, what you got for me? I ain't got shit for you, boy. -Hey. -Hey, girl. I didn't know you were gonna stop by today. -I'll call you later. -Oh. -Um, ahem, who that, girl? -That's nobody. Hm, he looks like he wants to be somebody's body. You were talking about me needing the D, he looked like he wanted to give it to you, right there on the desk. Don't nobody got time for these New Orleans dudes. They on some real clown shit. Like damn near wearing a bear costume riding a unicycle and shit. No, ma'am. Ooh! What about Ashton's father? Hm, I haven't seen that fool in over a year. See, try these guys out here at your own risk. They should all come with warning labels. You did always love a man who could play a horn. What did you say in college, if he knows how to play a horn then he knows how to use his lips. Yeah, shocker, a jazz trumpeter as my baby daddy isn't quite the windfall I was promised, okay? Now, he's been ghost for most of Ashton's life, but you know what my baby ain't never gonna go without like I did. What's this? You're the Grand Boule queen? I thought you were going back to DC? I was planning to, but, uh... Then I had lunch with Brenda Grace, and she pulled the whole "Claire's my oldest and dearest friend" card and, well, guilted me into staying another week. So, you're taking Elisha's place as the Boule queen? No, she just asked me to be the honorary Boule queen and announce a grant that the Harrington Foundation is giving to a youth center in the Ninth Ward. Apparently, that was the last thing that Elisha was working on. Yeah, I know, I was the one that was helping her with the plans. Oh! Ti, I had no idea. Look, I'll talk to Brenda Grace. I mean, it really should be you since you were the one helping Elisha. Brenda Grace would burn that distillery to the ground before she let a girl from the bottom represent her precious family at the Grand Boule. Hey, sis, do not let her get you down, okay? Look, I booked us into the spa for your birthday tomorrow. So, it'll be you plus me equals facials, massages and bottomless mimosa brunch! Okay, that'll make me feel little bit better. But drinks on me tonight at Gris-Gris. -Yes. -Yeah. Treat yourself with a nice dress. Of course. Love you. Miles, it's Tamera. Again. Will you please call me back? We need to talk. God, I forgot my phone. Dayveon, what you thinking? People can't keep seeing you in here like this. What you worried about, old girl? She don't even know me, ya hear me? I ain't worried about Jordan. What I want to know is that you can handle what we discussed. I got you. Ain't no problems. Let me tell you. The Crowns running that shit. Hm, so you think you got me? Yeah, I do. You need not worry. ♪ Congested ♪ ♪ Congested ♪ Congested ♪ Congested ♪ Congested ♪ Congested Thanks for the photo. The plates match. Get that son of a bitch. Okay, all right, well, cheers to that. You two got us out of more trouble than the number of drunks showing their asses on a "COPS" marathon. I just know that when I first met ya y'all you were two stuck up New Orleans princesses. Y'all had never been through half that stuff I went through as a kid. I get it, but we knew you didn't like talking about your childhood and you never wanted us to meet your aunt or uncle and we respected that. Nevertheless, we ended up ride-or-die besties. Well, I just thank y'all two for always having my back. -You know? -Of course. I appreciate them. And silver spoon or not, Elisha, she was a real one. -To Elisha. -To Elisha. Yeah? This place is so quiet. Hm! Don't look now. -What? -Don't look. Damn it, girl! I said, "Don't." Damn. Who this woman, Harpo? That's his new boo, Simone Russell. She in real estate. Them two've been hot and heavy for about six months. Well, before your fat ass sashayed into town. Well, a switching you like to do. Who is that? Um, that is... Jordan Touissant. -She's-- -Girl, seeing you. Well played, my friend. Girl. Ain't nobody thinking about Marcus. Oooh, girl, come on! Hm-hm. Amaya Grace... This crown... has been in our family for five generations. Come on, baby. And one day, you'll wear it at the Grand Boule. Did, did my mommy wear it too? -Baby, she was supposed to-- -Hey, baby girl! Ah! -Hey! -Look at this. This was mommy's. Oh, this is pretty. Did your grandmother give this to you? Huh. Hey, why don't you go upstairs and get ready for bed and I'll be up in a minute to tuck you in? I just want to talk to your grandmother for a moment. -Okay, love you, daddy. -Love you too. Hey! -Good night. -Good night, baby. You wanna tell me why you were talking to my daughter about the Grand Boule? She needs to know her family history. It's tradition, Miles. Mother, you are unbelievable, you know that? -I'm unbelievable? -Yeah, unbelievable. Elisha hasn't even been gone a month, yet and here you... You know what, I don't think we should participate in the Boule this year. Miles... Honey, I know you're grieving. Yes. We're all are, love. But the Grand Boule was started by our ancestors who purchased their freedom and built the bourbon distillery. -The Harrington brand. -Yeah. That started our family's fortune. That in which will always be honored... by our family. Yeah, the Harrington brand you know, I heard this story a thousand times, Mother. And I understand it, okay? But Elisha, she meant... You know what... I can't do this with you right now. -Miles... -This is... Yes, Chief Lewellyn, what is it? Sorry to call so late, Mrs. Harrington, but I'd thought you'd want to hear the news right away. Yes, yes, please. Go, go right ahead, Chief. We found the driver of the car that killed Elisha. Thank you, God. Our officers pursued the suspect and had him trapped. Once he saw there was no way out he drove his truck into the river. Ernie Reynolds is the prime suspect in the fatal hit-and-run of Elisha Harrington. We're confident that once our forensics team gets a hold of his truck, we will find evidence that'll match the crime scene. Thank you. -Chief... -Uh-huh? Uh, are you sure that this is the driver that killed Elisha Harrington? Ernie Reynolds had more DUIs than the law allows. Once our officers tried to pull him over, he took off. -Cigar? -Uh, no, thank you. Only guilty people run from cops. Hm. That's right, they do. -It's a good day. -Yes, it is. -Hey. -Hey. Are you by any chance watching the news? Yep. Hm-hm, so it's done. I call bullshit. Someone's trying to cover up the fact that Elisha was murdered. Exactly. Thank you. Cheers to that massage and facial. That was everything. Uh, cheers to the birthday girl. One time for the birthday B, two times for the birthday B. This was just the birthday present I needed, thank you. I'm just so glad you enjoyed it. It's the least I can do since you agreed to make my Grand Boule gown. It's what Elisha would have wanted. I'm just thankful that they finally found the guy that killed her. Do you really think they found the right guy? Why? Don't you? I just can't stop thinking about Elisha's last voicemail. I just wonder what she wanted. Where's Sully? Oh, God! -Hey, girl. -Hey, girl. Yo, what's going on over there? Uh! I caught myself trying to cook. And who thought that was a good idea? Ha, ha! Very funny. Marcus is on his way over here, so I thought I'd at least attempt dinner. Hm! What's he coming over for? You're not still thinking about Ernie Reynolds. Ooh! Are you stealing Simone's man? Ugh, girl! Ain't nobody trying to resuscitate a relationship. I'm the one who broke up with Marcus, remember? Girl, there was no lingering feelings since I moved to DC for my dream job. Look, I just don't want you to get hurt again, okay? Oh, girl, he's here I gotta go. -Come in. -Bye. Oh! Wow! Something burning? Nothing by my pride. Now don't tell me Miss Jordan Touissant tried to go ahead and cook. -"Chef Boyar-Don't?" -Uh-huh. -Hm-huh. -Yeah. Well... Look at you, making detective. -It's big. -It is. I know, thank you, thank you, thank you. Speaking of, um... Detective... Can you help me detect why a man police say ran off a bridge to escape arrest, didn't die from drowning? So, you read Ernie Reynold's autopsy report? Hm-hm, when I stopped by to see Sully there was a Dr. Zhang there. Apparently, she's from the Baton Rouge office and she was stepping in to do double duty because Sully was on an "extended vacation" with no return date. So? How did you get the report? -Hm! -Hm! -Right. -Hm-hm. I maybe told her that... I sometimes help Sully out with cases and I just asked her for Ernie Reynold's autopsy. And she seemed so overwhelmed between two offices that, um, yeah. She was almost happy to give it to me. Gave it to someone that she thought was there to help. Tell me why do you think Ernie Reynolds was dead before his truck went into the water. Well, as you can see here... Hm-hm. There was no water in his lungs. Hm. That means he was dead before his body ever hit the water. Hm-hm. Now, get this. This is very interesting, 'cause I did a little bit more digging myself. The Harrington bourbon company... It's been on the rocks for past few years. No pun intended. But they've been laying off a hell of a lot of workers. -Really? -Hm-hm. They don't seem like they're hurting. And they just opened a restaurant last year. But if what you're saying is true, then... where's the money coming from for this youth center that Elisha wanted to open? There you go. Whatchu want? I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am. My name is Dr. Jordan Touissant. I wanted to talk to you about your husband, Ernie Reynolds. Police done fixed their story on my Ernie. Well, that's why I'm here. I don't believe the story from the police. Look, I just wanna know what really happened to my friend. -Elisha Harrington. -Whatchu wanna know? I can't be seen talking to nobody 'bout this stuff. Is somebody threatening you, Mrs. Reynolds? Because if they are, I can get help. -The police... -The police? Don't bring that people round here. Mrs. Reynolds, listen... anything you say to me will not get back to the police. You have my word. My Ernest quit drinking six months ago. The pastor at the church was helping him out real good. He hadn't touch that stuff in months. Ain't no way he hit nobody. Did the police know that he stopped drinking? I told them soon as they dragged me down to ID his body. Ain't listen to nothin' I said. And when they dragged his car out of the river... he wasn't able to refute their story. And that's when the other man came by to make sure I ain't say nothing. Wait, what other man? Ernest got laid off after twenty years from the Harrington Distillery. A man came by and said they'd freeze his pension if I talked. Most of the time, nobody cared what happened in the Ninth Ward as long as we was just killing ourselves. We know that's changed now? Changed? Baby, this been Three Crowns gang territory forever. Now every blocks being overrun by redevelopment. I need that pension money to hold on to this house. This is the only thing I got left from my Ernest. Wait, Mrs. Reynolds, wait. Who's behind the redevelopment? You said you Elisha Harrington's friend, right? Then you should already know the answer. Look, baby, don't come 'round here no more. I don't need no more trouble. Marcus! Oh, shit. Jordan! Jordan! Jordan! Hey, Jordan. Jordan. It's going to be okay. Easy, easy. Oh, good. You're awake. Do you mind? -No, go ahead. -Thank you. -Open those eyes for me. -Hmm-hmm! Eyes open. -Ah! -Yeah! Yeah, you've got quite a concussion. Which you're fortunate because you know, head injuries can be real serious. When can she go home, Harrington? I'll write a prescription for the headache you're definitely going to have. But she shouldn't be alone for a while. -I'm gonna be fine. -Hey, hey. Okay, hey, easy, take it easy, okay? Yeah, yeah, excuse me. Uh, look... Hey... Don't worry, I got you. Yes? You got it? Yeah, yeah, thank you, Harrington. Jordan, are you sure you don't want to just rest? Miles said take it easy. I'm fine. All right. Besides... I have a surprise. And what is this? Elisha's laptop. How did do you get Elisha's laptop? Well, after I spoke to Ernie Reynold's wife, I went by Elisha's office at the foundation. I told her assistant that I needed to gather some information for the Boule announcement. And her laptop was just on her desk. Okay. Okay, let's see. No, it's not her birthday. Hmm. Well, maybe it's something to do with her daughter. Maybe, uh, songs or lyric... You know what? Her daughter was named after a character in her favorite book. She must have read it like a hundred times in college. -There we go! -We're in. Here we go. Hmm... My affair with your husband... What is this? Oh, my God! It looks like someone was sending Elisha emails for over a year, taunting her. Hmm. let me see. And really explicit details... of all their sexual rendezvous around town. Hmm! Wait, hold on! Your husband doesn't want you anymore. He's laying in my bed night after night... when you think he's at the hospital. This is crazy. And the email is untraceable. And of course I can't ask the department's tech to look up the IP address, 'cause... Without raising flags with the chief. Actually I might know someone who can help us. Well, hello. To what do I owe the pleasure of this bedtime phone call? Um, hey, Thomas. I need a favor. Anything for you. I need to trace an IP address from an email. Do you think you could have someone look at it? Yeah. No problem. Send it over. So I think you got some friends in mighty high places. So... What else do you think that Miles is been hiding? I don't know. But whatever it is, it was... worth someone tryin' to kill me over. All right, listen, I'm leaving at the end of the week, so... we need to figure this out quickly. Wait, hold on. What-what is this? It looks like she... signed a lease for a townhome. Do you think she was planning on leaving Miles? Well... there's only one way to find out. How do we even get in to the townhouse? One second. It's my turn to call a little favor from a friend. Hey! Yeah, yeah, doing good. Huh, can you do me a little favor? Oh, I'm sorry, one sec. Well, that was nice of your girlfriend to call the security guard to let us into the development. Yes, it was. Simone's sold a couple of units in the complex, so it was a pretty easy call to make. There's nothing of Elisha's inside. So why did she sign a lease in this neighborhood? This area was once controlled by the city's most grimiest gang Triple Crowns, until a real estate development company, by the name of BlackCourt Holdings, started buying everything in sight. Well, on another note... I see you wearing that perfume that I love. I never stopped wearing it after you gave it to me for Valentine's Day. Why aren't you responding? I can't stop thinking about you. And... can't stop thinking about us. I got a little confession for you. The night you left New Orleans after your mother's funeral... I was coming over to propose. What? I don't know what to say. You could've said yes. I loved you so much. But... But you left me. You know why I left. We had been fighting for weeks. The stress of taking care of my mom and juggling work... it was just too painful to stay in New Orleans after she died. So when I got an offer to go to DC and run a lab, that is what I needed.

Earth to Jordan. I'm sorry, girl, this dress is everything. You did the damn thing. Yes, I did. But what's going on? You worried about the house not selling or something? No, it's just... I'm just trying to find more information on the suspect that the police say killed Elisha. What information? The cops already said his car matches the one at the scene, and that street cams caught him in the area. But that doesn't explain why someone came to my house. You don't believe this was a some random break-in? Am I surprised that someone broke into your townhome? No. Do I believe that a guy with a hundred DUIs killed our friend? Yes. Case closed. Personally, I'm glad his ass is dead. Yo, that shit hurt, doc. Hurry up. Easy. Okay. You didn't tell me how you got this knife wound on your arm. Not sure you want to know that. Lots going on in these streets. Ya feel me? Do you need any help, Dr. Harrington? No, no. I'm almost done here. All right. Thank you. Well, I just thought you'd want to know the stabbing victim you operated on this afternoon didn't make it. Police are on their way. Oh, excuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Harrington. -He's in exam bay number three. -Thank you. I'll be back tomorrow, Doc. Make sure you're here. We good? Yeah. Yeah! I'll see you tomorrow and I'll check on those stitches and... I'll get that prescription for you. Hmm-hm! Hey, Jordan. What are you doing here? I was just coming by to see if you could check up my head again. I'm hoping to get rid of this bandage before the Boule. I also was wondering if I could take you to dinner. We haven't really had a chance to really spend any time together. Yeah, you know what, that sounds great. Let me just finish this paperwork here and I'll come back and check on that head, okay? -Thank you. -All right. Hey. Thanks again for staying for the Grand Boule. It really means a lot to mother. -And me too. -Happy to. You know, you're lucky to be alive. And you were lucky to be married to Elisha. So then, why did you cheat on her? It's not something that I'm proud of. And nothing's happening right now, I can promise you that. Okay? It-it all ended a year ago. -Who was it? -It was a nurse. Nurse at the hospital. Does she still work there? No. She moved to Shreveport. We both agreed that it was for the best. How could you do that to Elisha? To your daughter? What I did was wrong, I know that. Okay? That affair was the worst mistake of my life. Yeah, when Elisha found out about it, after she found out about it, she confronted me. Look, we went-we went to counseling for a year just to repair this marriage. We worked hard, both of us. Our marriage, our marriage was in such a, such a good place. We... even made plans of finally moving out of mother's estate. Why? Elisha loved that place. Let's just say it was about time. We found this nice, beautiful plot of land to build our dream home on. We knew that it will take about a year for us to build it. So, Elisha went out and found a beautiful townhouse for us to stay in just until it was finished being built. Now-now she's gone. Hey, you two. I saw you on the window. You don't mind if I join, do you? Oh, please. Sit down. Right. Ashton's at my cousin's tonight, so mama is a free woman. I... I stopped by the hospital to take Miles to dinner. We really haven't had a chance to talk since the funeral. Yeah, how have you been, Miles? I feel like I haven't talked to you in so long. You have been getting my messages, right? I've actually been staying busy at the hospital because whenever I'm home, all I can do is think about my wife laying on the side of the road, scared, cold... alone. Sorry, must be so hard on you and Amaya Grace. What the hell, Marcus? So this why you needed to get into the townhouse so you could screw your ex-girlfriend! On the balcony, really? I can't believe you. Don't touch me! Well, well, what do we have here? Detective, perhaps we should talk in my office. Detective! ♪ Praying that I'm strong enough ♪ ♪ You think I'm strong enough oh no ♪ Jordan, last night, you sent me a text saying that we made a mistake. And this morning, it's, "911, get over here." So, please, tell me which one is it? What took you so long? I texted you over an hour ago. I'm sorry, I was meeting with my union rep about my newly instated suspension. -Suspension? For what? -Yes. Suspension... For behavior unbecoming of a police officer while on duty. Someone sent pictures of us on that balcony last night to Simone and the entire department. -Are you serious? -Yes, I am. Serious. Maybe that's the person who broke into my house last night. Elisha's laptop is missing. Well... Okay, well, hey... Are you sure you just didn't forget where you put it? When I went to sleep last night the laptop was on the nightstand. I know that because my phone was on top of it. Your phone... Was that before or after you sent this? "We made a mistake." We did make a mistake. Can we please just focus on the fact that someone came into my house last night? When I woke up, my phone was there but the laptop was gone. Well... Yeah, someone must now know that we're looking into Elisha's death. -Yeah! -Yeah! But who? Why don't you... call him and ask him? Beautiful. I can call Thomas later. You know, when I was at the hospital... Miles was stitching up a patient. This guy with that... Three Crowns tattoo. I could've sworn it was the same guy I saw at Tamera's boutique. Wow. Interesting part is... usually them gangsters don't even seek hospital... treatment 'cause they're scared they gonna attract attention from most cops. So the real question is what could he possibly want with Miles? From what I overheard, it sounded like they had unfinished business. Ah! Look at this beautiful boy. Tamera, he looks just like you. That's mama's little man. Aww! So sweet. Oh, thanks for stopping by to pick up the dress. I just finished the alterations last night. For you, my dear. The Belle of the Boule. Thank you. I appreciate it. Girl, what's wrong? You look stressed. Did you know that Miles and Elisha were having marital problems? Problems? What do you mean? Last year, Elisha found out that Miles was having an affair. Miles? No! He would never cheat on Elisha. No, I found the emails that Elisha sent to the other woman. What? So you know who this woman is? He claims it's one of the nurses at the hospital. I have somebody looking into it. Why would he lie about cheating on Elisha with a nurse? I don't know. Have you ever heard of... Mayfair Springs Luxury Townhomes owned by BlackCourt Holdings? No, why? She had a lease agreement for a townhome there. I'm wondering if she was thinking about leaving Miles. And, I mean, what if he found out and... And what, girl? He killed her? I mean, even if Miles was having an affair with someone he doesn't want you to know about, doesn't mean he killed her. Girl, I really do think that concussion messed with your head. I'm telling you. Something is not right. Girl, will you please stop running around playing CSI New Orleans? Sorry. Please just try on the dress. I'm gonna go check on Miles's baby sister. While you do that. You're right. Jordan? -Jordan? -I'm in here. Wow! My God! You look absolutely beautiful. Um... Do you mind helping me with my zipper? Sure. Marcus, we can't. Why? Is it because you're with Thomas? Aren't you with Simone? Simone isn't you. ♪ Sometimes bad girls ♪ Gotta take... ♪ Come on come on come on Jordan, come on out here so I can see if there's anything else I need to do to the dress. Okay. Girl, this red is popping on you. Whoo! Oh! Well, hey, Marcus. What are you doing here? Uh, hey, Tamera. I just came by to give Jordan a little update. Hmm. An update? Is that what the kids are calling it these days? Stop. Marcus, you should go. We need to finish this dress. The Boule is this weekend. Have a good day, lady. Bye, Marcus. Tamera... Girl, you got a little sneaky link going on in here. You know, like that. It's-it's nothing. Girl, who're you fooling? It is clear by the look on both of your faces that you both still have feelings Look... I just need to find out what really happened to Elisha and then I can get back to DC. Back to my life. There's no Marcus. I don't know why you insist on lying to yourself, but what I do know is that this dress is perfection. -Hmm! -Hmm-hm. It is! And with two days to spare. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. All right, I'm gonna take it off. Look, wait... No, we need to meet. I don't care what you think. Jordan's been asking too many questions. You got a lot of nerve showing your face around here. You need to keep your mouth shut. I heard you've been talking to the wrong people. And if you want to keep the pension and the rest of the money, you'll shut the hell up. Well, look who's giving orders now. What you think, you big shit? You think them people up there gonna ever see you for more than you are? Girl, you ain't nothing, but trash from the Ninth Ward? You always thought you was better than somebody ever since you started hanging out with that Harrington girl. You turned your back on your own blood. After me and Ernie raised your ass. Anyway... Ernie is dead now. So if you want me to stop talking, I'm going to need some more money. 'Cause that pension alone ain't going to keep me in the style of livin' I become accustom to. So you better get me some more money. You'll get your money. I know that's all you ever cared about. I'm gonna leave you. I want you to lock that door and make sure nobody comes in, okay? -Yes, sir. -Okay. I'mma go home and I'm gonna get some clothes and I'm gonna come here and stay with you for tonight. But first, I'm gonna stop by the station to see if there's any word on your break-in. -Marcus. -Yes? You don't have to babysit me. He's not gonna to come back. I want to be here to make sure. All right. -Okay. -Goodnight. I will not... lose you again. Now... I know you probably have not been shooting... Hmm-hmm, no. Touissant, you look at me and listen. This is a loaded weapon. And what I need you to do... You unload this entire magazine if anybody but me comes through that door. Okay? -Let me hear you say it. Okay? -Okay. Okay. Okay. I will see you soon. You know... I told Elisha to watch out for the likes of you. You're not just one of our kind of people. Trash will always be trash. You were a conniving manipulator riding on Elisha's pedigree coattails. Always begging to borrow money for your little boutique. -That was an investment. -Oh! Elisha believed in me. Okay! So what did you do to repay her? Sleep with her husband. But I guess if your mother's a whore... why would you grow up to be any different? Little girl, don't you dare. I wasn't surprised when my son was seduced by his wife's best friend, I was just disappointed... that he had to knock your raggedy ass up. And I had to clean up his mess. I need money if you want this plan to continue. Jordan's been sniffing around and... she's starting to put the pieces together. Hmm. I don't have enough money in the house. But you can make this work. Oh, and take your little bastard with you. Yes, she's becoming a problem. Fix it. The Grand Boule is this weekend. And that bitch can't ruin my announcement. -Hey, girl! -Hey, Tam. I was just calling to let you know that I'm not going to make it dinner tonight. Marcus is gonna stop by later. Oh, we should actually find out who Miles was having an affair with tonight. Look, girl, all I care about is you. Okay? Um... I need to run a few errands. I'm gonna drop Ashton off at the babysitters. But I'll be right over, okay? But, girl, you do not have to come over here. I told you, Marcus is coming. I'll be fine. No, you shouldn't be alone. Okay? I'll be right over. I love you. I love you too. Okay. What are you doing back in my station when you're suspended? I heard over the radio that Dayveon Simms was brought in for suspected break-in at my friend's house. And I want to see what he had to say. This city has over a 100 murders a year. We don't have the time or manpower to waste precious resources on a break-in where no one was seriously hurt and nothing of value taken. She was assaulted. Let me shoot straight so even you can understand, detective. You've been looking into some things that don't really require your attention. Take this suspension seriously before I throw you off the force permanently. Do I make myself clear? Hmm. Yes, sir. -Knock-knock. -Oh, my God! Girl! Tamera, you do not have to wait on me. Really, I told you, I'm fine. Babe, it's my pleasure. Just drink a little tea and relax. And I'll just stay until Marcus comes back. This is really good. -Glad you like it. -Hmm. Huh-huh-huh! Listen to nurse, Tamera. Okay? This could wait. You need to rest. Okay, girl. You know... I really am so lucky to have you. Lucky to have you, honey. Tam... I am really tired. It's okay. You bitches always thought you were better than me. You know, Miles was mine first. But once he saw Elisha... he forgot all about me. Until she had Amaya Grace. And she was just too tired to take care of that man's needs. It was easy to get him back in my bed. And now Miles can really get to know his son Ashton. It turns out, I'm gonna get her man... and her money. Come on, Jordan! Why don't you pick up the phone? Hmm. Babe! Huh-huh-huh! Ain't no time for that. I've been thinking about them cakes all the day. Come on. I've been thinking about my money. So why don't you stay on task? Who you getting loud with? My Crowns soldiers been doing all the work. Running folks and business outta the Ninth. Now stay ready, you feel me? I know, baby. And you've been doing such a great job. Block by block. No one would ever think that New Orleans' most notorious hitters was working for me... and those blue blood Harrington's. But we did that. You're damn right. We just have a couple of loose ends, that's all. Gotta get rid of Jordan before Marcus comes back. Go to the boutique, get the materials wrap up the body so we can dump her. -We ain't got much time. -Hmm-hmm. Yo, Tam? Damn, Dayveon. Didn't I just say we ain't got much time? What you 'bout to do, Day-Day? I put you on. Triple Crowns wouldn't be gettin' this paper if it wasn't for me. Boy, put that gun away. Quit playin'. Sorry, my baby. It's time for you to exit, so the Crown's got a bigger piece. See, no matter how good that ass is, the game always gonna be the game. Ashton needs me. Please don't do this. No, no, no... Yeah. It's done. I'll move the body, so you can pin it on the cop. Just make sure you come through on her cut. Oh, you waking up. Huh? No, huh-huh, huh-huh! You shouldn't have been snooping with that cop, you little ass. Now you're going to end up dead, just like you friends. But... now we can go ahead and have a little fun together first. Yeah! Come here. Bitch, you ain't gonna kill me. You broke into my house. You attacked me. You killed my friends. Why wouldn't I kill you? Because I don't want you to going to jail for this piece of shit. Oh, you could trust. I ain't going to jail. My lawyer will have me out in the morn-- I'm gonna enjoy this one. Elisha was a... beautiful soul. She loved Miles. She loved you! Tell my son... I did all of this for him. -Did what? -Jordan. He didn't understand what needed to be done. Miss Elisha... discovered that the real estate deals that were needed to sustain our family after the distillery collapsed were being facilitated by that bitch Tamera and her gang. Come here. I gave her the land for the youth center... and it still wasn't enough to appease her ass. -So you had her killed? -Oh, hmmm-hmm! Don't do that, Jordan. Don't judge me. She was going to sell out our family and turn my baby, my son against me. What do you think is going to happen when he finds out what you've done? It needed to be done. Brenda Grace Harrington... I'm placing you under arrest for the conspiracy to commit murder. You have the right to remain silent. And anything you say can and definitely will be held against you in the court of law. Take her away. Huh! Wow! How did Tamera and Brenda Grace even start working together? Well, Tamera blackmailed Brenda Grace into cutting her in on the BlackCourt deals or she'd reveal that Ashton was Miles's son. In return, Brenda Grace asked her to get three Crowns involved to clear out the neighborhood they were redeveloping. And when Elisha found out about the gang's involvement with the family's real estate deals, Brenda Grace told Tamera Elisha had to be dealt with. Well, hmm-hmm. All right, get this, when they question Dayveon at the hospital last night, and he realized that he was facing the death penalty for two murders and an attempt on your life, big bad day to be honest saying like a canary. And told them all about Tamera's plan. But... who did Tamera get to pin Elisha's murder on Ernie Reynolds? Hmm. Slow down. That's our next stop. Let's go. Hmm. You know Ernie Reynolds? Ernie Reynolds was Tamera's uncle. He molested her for years. So he was the perfect person to take the fall for Elisha's death. And so, the chief had Ernie killed and his car dumped. And it was no problem that they didn't find water in the lungs because they had Sully in their pocket, too. You just might make a cute little detective. Come on, let's get out of here. ♪ Not afraid to fly no fear of falling ♪ Wow, well, well, well... Oh, my God. You look beautiful. Thank you. You clean up nice yourself. Oh, do I? Do I take a look on the left? Oh! -What, you Eddie Murphy now? -Huh, I don't know. Not! Just Marcus. Hey... You sure you're up for this, right? We don't have to go. They'll forgive you. I know. But, um... I really want to honor Elisha's memory tonight. Thanks for coming with me. I'd do anything for you. You know I gotcha. You know... Now that Sully has been put in jail for falsifying autopsy reports and tampering crime scene evidence, you know, our little old city in New Orleans is in desperate need for a new chief medical examiner. Well... Maybe it is time for me to come home. Well... Welcome home, babe.
