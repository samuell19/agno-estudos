Stolper: WELL, THE BODY MAY HAVE WASHED UP HERE, BUT, UH, IF THE CRIME SCENE IS THE KELLER HOTEL, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, IT'S A MANHATTAN CASE. IF THERE'S ANY CASE AT ALL. YOUR GUY'S DEAD. FORTUNATELY IT'S FOUND IN THE 3-5, SO YOU CAN'T LAY CLAIM TO THAT HOMICIDE. BOWLING PIN? I'M NOT SO SURE HE WAS MY GUY. NOT SO SURE? NO. WELL, HE WAS KNOWN TO BE VIOLENT. HE WAS THE GIRLS PIMP AND UH, HE WAS LINKED TO THE SCENE. WHAT, UH, WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT? YEAH, WELL, WHAT IF THE HOMICIDES ARE CONNECTED? LOGAN, NOT YOUR CONCERN ANYMORE. I DON'T THINK KINGSTON KILLER THE GIRL. OH, YOU TOO, NOW. WHAT IS IT, CONTAGIOUS? LOOK, GET EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND GIVE IT TO THE 2-7, ALL RIGHT? JEEZ. THEY NEVER HAVE ANY TOWELS IN THOSE THINGS. WHERE'S JAMIE? BURN OUT ANOTHER ASSISTANT? LOOK, I NEED TO STAY ON THIS CASE. Jack McCoy: WELL, I'D SAY A TASK FORCE ISN'T WARRANTED IN THE CASE YOU DESCRIBED TO ME OVER THE PHONE. WELL, THEN, I'D HAVE TO SAY YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF INVESTIGATION. YOU TRY TO ANNOY PEOPLE OR DOES IT JUST COME NATURALLY? > IT'S A GIFT. SETTING UP A TASK FORCE TIES UP TWO PRECINCTS. TO TIE UP TWO PRECINCTS IN A HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION INVOLVING THE MURDER OF A PROSTITUTE-- OH, I SEE-- SO ONE LIFE IS WORTH MORE THAN ANOTHER, HUH, COUNSELOR? DON'T TRY TO TELL ME THAT I'M LABORING UNDER SOME KIND OF MORAL DICHOTOMY HERE. YOU HAVE AN AGENDA, DETECTIVE. DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW IT. I'LL LET YOU KNOW IN A COUPLE OF DAYS, BUT WHATEVER THE DECISION IS, IT'LL BE WHAT'S BEST FOR THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK. NOT WHAT'S BEST FOR MIKE LOGAN. Taylor: HELLO? HELLO, MISS TAYLOR? YES. IT'S DETECTIVE MIKE LOGAN. OH, HELLO, DETECTIVE. I JUST THOUGHT I'D CHECK AND SEE HOW YOU'RE DOIN'? OH, THANK YOU. I'M FINE. OKAY-- UH, WELL, IF YOU DON'T MIND I'D LIKE TO CALL YOU IN A COUPLE DAYS AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. WELL, I'D LIKE THAT. OKAY. Lt. Stolper: LOGAN. SIT DOWN. I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO HAND THIS GARBAGE CASE OVER TO 2-7, RIGHT? WHY AM I EVEN HEARING ABOUT A TASK FORCE? Det. Logan: LOOK, I CAUGHT THE CASE. I GOTTA SEE IT THROUGH. WAIT A MINUTE, LET'S DON'T REWRITE HISTORY, OKAY? I GAVE YOU THE CASE. YEAH, I KNOW AND I APPRECIATE IT. YOU THINK I WANNA PISS YOU OFF? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? YOU PISS PEOPLE OFF JUST SAYING GOOD MORNING. WE HAD A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO THROW THIS TURKEY BACK ACROSS THE HARBOR, WHERE IT BELONGS. LET THEM CLOSE IT OUT. THE CASE IS STILL WIDE OPEN. LOGAN, LOOK, THE PIMP KILLED THE GIRL AND HE'S DEAD. IT IS OVER. DON'T YOU GET IT? LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHO KILLED THAT GIRL. ALL I'M ASKING YOU IS JUST TO LET ME KEEP DIGGIN' TILL I DO KNOW. LET YOU KEEP DIGGING? YOU GOTTA KEEP DIGGING. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T TURN IT OVER TO THE 2-7. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. AND THAT'S WHY YOU PISS ME OFF. Det. Silvera: YEAH, RIGHT, THANKS. GET A LOAD OF THIS. THAT WAS GEORGEANNE. PIMP'S DEAD KILLER, ONE SUNNY TENDATO RUSSO, BURGLARY, GUN POSSESSION, AND A STINT FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER. NICE RESUME. AND HE'S A MADE GUY, UZIELLI FAMILY. I'M TELLIN YOU, THIS THING CONNECTS TO THE UZIELLI'S, IT COULD BE HUGE. YOU KNOW THE OLD MAN? DON? YEAH, I KNOW HIM, WHY? Don Giancarlo Uzielli: FRANKIE SILVERA. YOU GREW UP NICE. MR. UZIELLI, THIS IS MY PARTNER, DETECTIVE LOGAN. HOW YOU DOIN'? YOU MISSIN' ONE OF YOUR BALLS? EXCUSE ME? OH, AN ASSOCIATE OF YOURS, SUNNY RUSSO, HE LEFT A BOWLING BALL IN A DINER. YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT? Jerry Kleinert: NO. WHO MIGHT YOU BE? I'M JERRY KLEINERT, MR. UZIELLI'S ATTORNEY. IN THE FUTURE, IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO MR. UZIELLI, I APPRECIATE IF YOU CALL ME FIRST, HUH? I'VE KNOWN MR. UZIELLI FOR MOST OF MY LIFE. I CAN CALL HIM WHENEVER I WANT. WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT? A HOMICIDE, DEAD GIRL. OUR PRIME SUSPECT WAS BEATEN TO DEATH WITH A BOWLING PIN, VERY STRANGE. SO, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, FRANKIE? HE GOT WHAT HE DESERVED. MAYBE HE WASN'T OUR GUY. MR. UZIELLI, SUNNY RUSSO IS NOW, WE ALL KNOW WHAT AN HONEST BUSINESS MAN YOU ARE. WHAT CAN I DO? CONSTRUCTION, WASTE REMOVAL, TRUCKING, SOMETIMES DISHONEST PEOPLE GET INVOLVED IN THESE VENTURES, JUST LIKE IN YOUR BUSINESS. YEAH, BUT YOU SEE, IT'S NOT BUSINESS, IT'S PERSONAL. SO, WHAT'S WITH THE SISTER? I FEEL SORRY FOR HER, THAT'S ALL. AND THAT MAKES IT PERSONAL? YEAH, WHAT CAN I TELL YOU, FRANKIE? YOU CAN TELL ME YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. Reed: PRINTS FROM THE HOTEL. EVERY SMUDGY ONE OF 'EM. YOU SURE ABOUT THIS? WHAT? GIANNI UZIELLI WAS IN THE ROOM? I CAN GUARANTEE HIS HANDS WERE. IT'S ALL RIGHT, WE CAN COUNT. SO, CHAD. PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE TABLE WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM. BOTH OF 'EM, BOTH YOUR HANDS. NOW, STAND UP. Gianni: I CAN'T. WHY NOT? UH, OKAY, HONEY, YOU CAN GO, NOW. ZIP UP, GENIUS. SHE WAS JUST CHECKIN' MY INSEAM. WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, WIPE THAT POWDER OFF YOUR NOSE. THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY. WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? I CAME BY TO GIVE YOU A RIDE HOME TO STATEN ISLAND. REALLY, WHAT FOR? LEWD BEHAVIOR, SOLICITING A PROSTITUTE, POSSESSION, YOU NAME IT. KISS MY ASS. HEY, HEY! GET OFF ME! GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME! LET GO OF ME! PUNK! YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHIN' ON ME, YOU HEAR ME? NOTHIN'-- YOU SEE THIS? IT'S A FAMILY RUN BUSINESS. GET THE CUFFS OFF, YA PUNK! Det. Kurtz: HEY, HEY, HEY. HEY, COME HERE. COME HERE, COME HERE, COME HERE. DRIVIN' ALONG AND HEARING THE . MIKE, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I TOLD YOU, WE GOT AN INVESTIGATION GOIN' ON IN THIS PLACE. YEAH, WELL, I GOT AN INVESTIGATION, TOO. HEY, YOU'RE MESSING UP MY THING, MOE. HEY, SAMMY, THIS IS MY THING. NOT YOUR THING. YEAH-- OKAY, FINE. YOU DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO. MY CLIENT'S SEAMSTRESS JUST HAPPENED TO BE TAKING A MEASUREMENT WHEN YOU CAME IN. THAT'S GOOD. WHAT WAS IT YOU THINK YOU SAW, DETECTIVE? WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP. THIS IS HARASSMENT. WHY DON'T YOU GET MY OLD MAN DOWN HERE WITH SOME BAIL MONEY? EVEN IF YOU DID SEE SOMETHING, THE WARRANT'S DEFECTIVE. PRIVATE OFFICE ISN'T PART OF THE CLUB, IT ISN'T EVEN MENTIONED IN THE WARRANT. ERGO, YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO BE THERE. SO, LEGALLY THE COCAINE WAS INVISIBLE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S FORGET THE WHOLE THING, BUT, UH, LET'S TALK ABOUT SUZANNE TAYLOR. WHO'S SUZANNE TAYLOR? SHE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN, WHO WAS BUTCHERED IN ROOM 25 OF THE KELLER HOTEL AND YOUR CLIENTS PRINTS WERE ALL OVER THE ROOM. HE'S GOT NOTHING, JERRY. HE'S JUST A PUNK COP LOOKIN' FOR OVERTIME, YOU GOT ME? SHUT UP-- SHUT UP. DETECTIVE, MY CLIENT IS GOING THROUGH A NASTY DIVORCE. HE'S A LONELY MAN, HE USES THE HOTEL FOR AN OCCASIONAL LIAISON. I'M SURE THAT IF YOU TOOK THE TROUBLE TO CHECK ALL THE OTHER ROOMS, YOU'D FIND HIS FINGERPRINTS IN THERE AS WELL. THE OTHER ROOMS DIDN'T HAVE ANY DEAD WOMEN IN 'EM. ALL RIGHT, LET'S QUIT PLAYING GAMES. YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO CHARGE MY CLIENT WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT YOU THINK YOU SAW AT THE CLUB. YOU'RE RIGHT. HE CAN GO. IF YOU HAD A GOOD TIME WITH HER, I HOPE YOU USED A CONDOM. THAT'S A BIZARRE COMMENT, DETECTIVE. WELL, YOU SEE, MY VICTIM HAD SYPHILIS AND SHE WAS HIV POSITIVE. IN THIS DAY AND AGE, YOU GOTTA HAVE SAFE SEX. Det. Briscoe: HEY, MIKE, WE'RE RIGHT OVER THERE. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE. THE FUTURE MRS. BRISCOE? FUTURE EX- MRS. BRISCOE. HEY, MIKE, OVER HERE, MOE. DID YOU GET MY MESSAGE? YEAH-- LOOK, MAN, I DIDN'T MEAN TO CROWD YA. FORGET ABOUT IT, BROTHER. WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE. LET IT SLIDE. ALL RIGHT.

Profaci: NO. COUPLE OF TIMES WITH, SAMMY. THIS IS SAMMY'S PLACE. I DON'T COME HERE. OH, YEAH? TELL YOU, THIS CASE IS DRIVING ME CRAZY. CRAZY, I GOT NOTHING. THAT OTHER HOMICIDE, YOU AND SAMMY WERE WORKING, RIGHT? YEAH, WE'RE ON THE FOUR TO ONE. HEAR ANY WHISPERS-- ANY? NAH, NOT TOO QUIET. IT WAS SO QUIET, SAMMY LEFT AROUND MIDNIGHT. I THINK HE GOT A CALL FROM ONE OF HIS BIMBOS. HMM? YEAH, COVER FOR HIM, HE COVERS FOR ME. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, HUH? YEAH, I KNOW. DID YOU GET HER NUMBER? SHE HAD MY NUMBER. THAT'S SOME SUIT SAMMY'S GOT ON. WHAT IS THAT, AN ARMANI? NAH, CUSTOM-MADE. HE ALWAYS WAS A DRESSER. Taylor: HELLO? Det. Logan: HEY, IT'S MIKE. OH, HI. IT'S NOT TOO LATE, IS IT? WELL, I USUALLY STAY UP PAST 9:30. LISTEN, YOU EVER BEEN ON THE STATEN ISLAND FERRY? IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE POOR MAN'S Q.E.2. HERE'S THE POOR MAN'S CHAMPAGNE. CHEERS. DON'T TELL ANYBODY, WE'RE BREAKING THE LAW. I GUESS ALL WE NEED NOW IS A FULL MOON. WILL YOU SHOW ME WHERE YOU FOUND HER? OUT TOWARD THE BRIDGE. YOU CAN'T SEE IT. PRETTY FAR OUT THERE. GEORGEANNE, DON'T LOOK AT THE WATER. COME ON. DON'T LOOK AT THE WATER. DON'T-- DON'T. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. HOW YOU DOIN', CHAMP? LET ME GET A COFFEE. NOT TOO DARK, NOT TOO LIGHT, OKAY? YOU GOT IT. DO YOU GOT SODA BREAD TODAY? YEP. HERE YOU GO. GET DOWN-- GET DOWN! YOU THINK YOU WERE THE INTENDED VIC? I DON'T KNOW. YOU THINK THE SHOOTER DIDN'T LIKE HIS BAGEL? HAD TO BE ME. MAYBE SOMEBODY JUST GOT PAROLE. PULL YOUR RECORD UP AT 2-7, CHECK ANY PERPS WHO MAY HAVE A GRUDGE. OKAY. DO YOU UH, HAVE AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION? YEAH. COPY ME ON THAT CASE, WILL YA? YOU GOT IT. THANKS. THANKS, FELLAS. Capt. Cragen: BOY, OLD MAN UZIELLI CAN SANCTION A HIT. NO WAY HE'S GONNA WHACK A COP. WHAT ABOUT GIANNI? MY INSTINCTS TELL ME HE'S CRAZY ENOUGH TO TAKE A SHOT AT A COP. OH, YEAH. HE'S CRAZY ENOUGH, ALL RIGHT. YOU SHOULD HEAR THE WAY HIS OWN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HIM. REAL LOOSE CANNON, OUT OF CONTROL. HELL, HE'S AN ORGANIZED CRIME VERSION OF YOU. COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO STATE TROOPERS PICKED HIM UP ON A D.W.I. TURNS OUT, HE WASN'T DRUNK, BUT HIS HEART WAS PUMPIN' MORE DRUGS THAN A PHARMACY. WHEN THEY BROUGHT HIM BEFORE THE JUDGE THE GUY WENT BALLISTIC. TOOK FIVE COURT OFFICERS TO RESTRAIN HIM. JUDGE ORDERED HIM LOCKED UP IN BELLEVIEW FOR MENTAL OBSERVATION. NO SURPRISES THERE, HUH? PSYCHOTIC, VIOLENT TENDENCIES. THIS IS NOT THE MOST STABLE OF WISE GUYS, MIKE. LET ME SET YOU UP WITH TASK FORCE PROTECTION, ALL RIGHT? THEY'D GET IN MY WAY. WHAT'D YOU ALWAYS USED TO TELL ME, DONNY? SOMEBODY REALLY WANTS TO KILL YOU, NOBODY CAN STOP 'EM. Gianni: YOU'RE A BITCH. I NEVER SHOULD HAVE MARRIED YOU! Gina Uzielli: YOU PIG! GET OUT OF HERE! HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY! GET OFF OF ME! HEY, HEY, HEY! ARE YOU COPS? SEE WHAT SHE'S DOIN'? Det. Silvera: YEAH. YEAH, GREAT. WELL, ARREST THIS BASTARD. YEAH, ALL RIGHT-- CALM DOWN. GIANNI, YOU GOT A MINUTE? WHAT? JUST A FEW QUESTIONS. ARE YOU CRAZY? YOU'RE TRESPASSIN'. THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY. YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY TOOK A POP AT ME TODAY. YEAH, TOO BAD THEY MISSED. I WANT A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST THIS ANIMAL. SHUT UP, YOU. I SAID I WANT HIM ARRESTED. I SAID, SHUT UP! I WANT HIM DEAD! TAKE IT EASY-- TAKE IT EASY. MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO COME DOWN TO THE PRECINCT, HUH? TALK TO MY LAWYER. YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID? THE SON OF A BITCH GAVE ME SYPHILIS! TOLD YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE WORN A CONDOM. ALL RIGHT YOU, BASTARD, JUST DRIVE AWAY. YOU CAN'T LOOK AT ME? WELL, I CAN'T LOOK AT YOU. KEEP GOING-- KEEP GOING! Lt. Stolper: WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? WE GOT NOTHING ON UZIELLI. YOU WENT TO HIS HOUSE? I GOT HIS PRINTS AT THE MURDER SCENE. HOW MANY OTHER PRINTS YOU FIND THERE, A THOUSAND? YOU GO TO ANYBODY ELSE'S HOUSE? NOPE. GOOD, VERY GOOD. GOOD THINKING. LIEUTENANT, THE GIRL DID WORK AT UZIELLI'S CLUB. NOT TO MENTION HE'S A PERMANENT FIXTURE AT THE KELLER HOTEL. SO WHAT? YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, THE PIMP, THE GIRL, UZIELLI ALL HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON, IT'S CALLED THE SEX BUSINESS. ANYBODY IN THAT RACKET GOES IN AND OUT OF THAT SEX CLUB AND THE HOTEL. CONNECTING UZIELLI WITH A SLEAZY HOTEL, THAT'S LIKE CONNECTING YOU WITH AN IRISH PUB. DON'T MEAN YOU KILLED A BAR MAID. STOLPER. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH-- RIGHT-- HOLD ON. THIS IS JERRY KLEINERT, UZIELLI'S ATTORNEY, TWO TO ONE HARASSMENT CHARGES. WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. YOU, I THOUGHT YOU HAD MORE SENSE. LOGAN-- I'M LISTENING. WHERE-- WE'LL BE THERE IN AN HOUR. UZIELLI WANTS A MEETING. SENIOR, NOT JUNIOR. THEN YOU GO WIRED. HE OFFERS YOU A BRIBE, I WANT IT IN FULL STEREO. MR. UZIELLI, WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SEE US ABOUT? Don Giancarlo: I WANT TO HELP MY BOY ANYWAY I CAN. SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? WHAT ANY FATHER WOULD SAY, THAT'S ALL. YOU KNOW, SOMEONE TOOK A SHOT AT ME THIS MORNING. YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT, WOULD YOU? WHY DO YOU ASK ME? ALLEGEDLY, YOU'RE A GOD FATHER, RIGHT? I AM A GODFATHER. I'VE GOT GODCHILDREN IN ALL FIVE BOROUGHS. THERE ARE RULES, DETECTIVE. I DON'T BREAK THEM. IF MY BOY-IF MY BOY KILLS A WHORE, IT'S UNFORTUNATE. A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY FOR HER FAMILY, BUT IF MY BOY TAKES A SHOT AT A COP, THAT'S A TRAGEDY FOR MY FAMILY. I JUST WANTED TO ASSURE YOU THAT IF THERE HAS BEEN SOME PROBLEM IN THE PAST, IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. YOU HAVE MY WORD. COULD IT GET ANY LOUDER IN HERE? NO WONDER HE WORKS OUT OF A BOWLING ALLEY. NOT THAT HE SAID A DAMN THING WORTH RECORDING ANYWAY. ALTHOUGH HE DID ADMIT HE WAS A GODFATHER. YEAH. MIKE. WHAT? Det. Logan: I DON'T KNOW WHO THE DIRTY COP IS AND I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH OUR CASE, BUT WHOEVER HE IS, HE'S IN MY OLD PRECINCT. I MIGHT EVEN KNOW THE GUY. LOOK, I JUST THOUGHT YOU NEEDED TO KNOW THIS, 'CAUSE WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER. Det. Silvera: YEAH, THANKS. WOW, THIS IS GREAT. WELL, AT LEAST YOU'RE NOT DOING THE SISTER. ENOUGH, WAIT. ARE YOU GONNA-ARE YOU GONNA WEAR A LEOTARD? Taylor: WHY DON'T YOU COME TO THE THEATRE AND FIND OUT? WELL, WAIT, I LIVE FOR THE DANCE, BABY. I MEAN, BUT WHAT I WANNA KNOW IS-WHAT I WANNA KNOW IS WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO AFTER THE DANCE? KNOW WHAT I MEAN? LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. LET'S GO. LISTEN, I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT? I DON'T. 'CAUSE I'M GETTIN' THIS GUY. COME HERE. I'M GETTIN' THIS GUY. I'M GONNA GET HIM. I AM THIS CLOSE TO GETTIN' HIM. YOU KNOW WHAT? WHEN I GET THIS GUY, WHEN I GET THIS CASE, FRONT PAGE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES, DAILY NEWS, NEW YORK POST, AND I'M BACK. I'M GONNA BE BACK IN MANHATTAN. SO-- WHAT-- WHAT? IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT? GETTING BACK TO MANHATTAN? WELL, NO. NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I'M TALKING ABOUT THE CASE. YOU KNOW, IF I GET THE CASE DONE-- I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE. DON'T TAKE IT LIKE THAT. THAT'S NOT WHAT I-- IF I GET THIS CASE AND IT GOES THE WAY I THINK IT'S GONNA GO-- I'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE. GEORGEANNE, I'M NOT-- I DID NOT MEAN IT LIKE THAT. GEORGEANNE! PLEASE, JUST LET ME GO HOME. WAIT A MINUTE. MARITZA! Maritza: NO! MARITZA-- MARITZA, IT'S ALL RIGHT. NO, NO, NO! THERE'S A FOX IN THE HEN HOUSE. WHICH HEN HOUSE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHERE'S CAT WALK? HEY, YOU'RE MESSIN' UP MY THING, MOE. Profaci: IT WAS SO QUIET, SAMMY LEFT AROUND MIDNIGHT. I USUALLY LIKE MY CRIME SCENES WITH A LITTLE BLOOD. YEAH, I COVER FOR HIM, HE COVERS FOR ME. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, HUH? REMEMBER THAT SONG: "MUST "HAVE BEEN IN THE WRONG PLACE "AT THE WRONG TIME." WHY ARE WE POINTING GUNS AT EACH OTHER? I DON'T KNOW. WHY ARE WE? AH. JEEZ, I SAW THE DOOR OPEN, I HEARD A NOISE IN THE ROOM. YOU'RE OUT LATE, AREN'T YOU? WHAT COULDN'T WAIT TILL MORNING? I WAS JUST GONNA ASK YOU THE SAME THING. THIS IS MY TOUR, FOUR TO ONE.

I'M JUST WONDERIN' WHY THE SUDDEN INTEREST IN MY CASE. JUST TRYIN' TO HELP A BROTHER. 'KAY, SAMMY. DO YOU MIND IF I RUN SOMETHING BY YOU, THEN? SHOOT-- HEY, I DON'T MEAN THAT LITERALLY. YOU EVER BEEN IN THIS ROOM PRIOR TO THE DAY WE WERE ALL HERE? THIS ROOM? NO, NO, NO. NOT THIS ROOM-- NO, WHY? WELL, IT'S JUST THEY FOUND YOUR PRINTS IN HERE. YOUR PRINTS FOUND AS WELL? YEAH. LENNIE'S, PROFACI'S, YOUR PARTNER'S PRINTS? YEAH. SO, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? YOU LEFT AROUND 5:15, WASN'T IT? YEAH, FIVE, 5:15, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ME, BRISCOE, PROFACI, WE DROVE BACK TO THE HOUSE. WHERE'S THIS GOIN'? NO, I'M-I'M JUST RUNNING THE SCENE THROUGH MY HEAD. YOU KNOW HOW THAT IS. YEAH, I KNOW HOW IT IS. HEY, MIKE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT? I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. DO YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE TOOK A SHOT AT ME? GLAD YOU'RE OKAY, BUT IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH SAMMY. YOU INVESTIGATING COPS NOW, MIKE? THE BLUE WALL STOPS AT HOMICIDE. I GOTTA GO. Det. Briscoe: BRING ME UP HERE FOR THE VIEW? I'VE SEEN IT. Det. Logan: THERE'S SOMETHING YOU NEED TO KNOW AND IT STAYS BETWEEN US. CROSS MY HEART AND HOPE TO DIE. WE GOT A PROBLEM AT THE 2-7. OKAY, YOU GOT ME. I HAD A FREE DOUGHNUT AT THE KRISPY KREME. AND I THINK IT'S SAMMY. WHAT? NO WAY. I DON'T KNOW HOW, BUT I THINK HE'S CONNECTED TO MY CASE. YOU THINK?

I'M AFTER THE KILLER OF SUZANNE TAYLOR. SAMMY GETS RUN OVER, I'M STILL MAKING THIS CASE. WHEREVER IT LEADS? WHEREVER. YOU EVER HEAR OF LOYALTY, MIKE? LOYALTY-- OH, OH, LET ME GET THIS RIGHT. LENNIE BRISCOE LECTURING ME ON LOYALTY. YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T HEAR MUCH FROM YOU WHEN I TOOK THAT RIDE OUT TO STATEN ISLAND. HEY, YOU SLUGGED THE POLITICIAN. WHAT THE HELL WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? I DON'T KNOW, YOU TELL ME. WHAT IF YOU-YOU DECIDE TO JUMP OFF A BRIDGE I'M SUPPOSED TO GO IN AFTER YOU? OH, MIKE LOGAN'S DROWNING, GET BRISCOE, THE LIFEGUARD. UZIELLI'S GOT A COP ON THE PAYROLL.

THE NIGHT SUZANNE TAYLOR WAS KILLED, GUESS WHO GETS A CALL AND LEAVES HIS POST AT MIDNIGHT? SAMMY. YEAH-- THERE'S NO PHONES AT THE KELLER IN THE ROOMS. SO, I COULDN'T CHECK THE PHONE RECORDS, BUT I DID CHECK THE INCOMING CALLS TO THE 2-7. GUESS WHO'S CELL PHONE NUMBER SHOWS UP ON THE CALLER I.D. THAT NIGHT? GIANNI UZIELLI. I MEAN, YOU TELL ME, LENNIE. UZIELLI, SAMMY, MY VICTIM, THE PIMP, THE PIMP'S KILLER, WHY DO THEY ALL SEEM TO BE CONNECTED? YOU WITH ME ON THIS? DO IT RIGHT AND I'M WITH YA. YOU DIVE OFF A BRIDGE, YOU HIT THE WATER ALONE. Lt. Van Buren: GREAT WAY TO START THE DAY. FIRST, I GET A CALL FROM INTERNAL AFFAIRS TELLING ME THEY WANT TO INTERROGATE MY OFFICERS. THEN, I FIND OUT YOU'VE KNOWN FOR MONTHS THERE WAS A DIRTY COP ON MY WATCH, BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME, YOU TOLD HIM. Capt. Cragen: WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE-- SAMMY KURTZ IS ONE OF THE FINEST OFFICERS WHO EVER SERVED UNDER ME AND I HAVE NOT HEARD ONE THING THIS MORNING THAT CHANGES MY OPINION. HEY, I DON'T HAVE AN OPINION NO SAMMY KURTZ, I'M JUST WORKING A CASE. LOOK, YOU KNOW THE GUY, I DON'T. SO, COULD BE THAT YOU'RE TOO CLOSE TO HIM. MAYBE I HAVE A CLEARER TAKE ON HIM THAN YOU DO. MM-HMM. MAYBE YOU DO, OR MAYBE IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE STILL AS SELF-OBSESSED AS YOU ALWAYS WERE. SHE SEEMS LIKE A NICE LADY. I.A.B. IS NOT GOING ANY FURTHER WITH THE WIRES. THEY WANT TO START THE INTERROGATIONS TOMORROW. THEY FIGURE THEY CAN FERRET OUT THE COP BY SWEATIN' THE WHOLE PRECINCT. I.A.B. COMES IN, I'M OUT OF THE PICTURE. WELL, YOU SAY THAT LIKE IT'S A BAD THING. OH, COME ON, YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO BUST A COP IN YOUR OLD PRECINCT, DO YOU? LOOK, IF SAMMY KURTZ IS INVOLVED IN THIS THING, LET I.A.B. DO THE DIRTY WORK. CASE GETS SOLVED, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHO SOLVES IT, RIGHT? RIGHT? YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE FOR ME THE LAST THREE YEARS? OKAY-- NOW, I GET IT. IF I EVER WANT TO GET BACK TO MANHATTAN, I NEED TO GET CREDIT ON THIS CASE. I.A.B. IS MEETIN' ME AT THE 2-7 TOMORROW AT FOUR. THEY WANT TO HIT THE NIGHT GUYS FIRST. I CAN TELL 'EM I CAN'T MAKE IT TILL 4:30, MIKE, THAT'S THE BEST I CAN DO. THANK YOU. NOW, MEANWHILE, I GOT A BIGGER PAIN IN THE ASS. I STILL GOT ONE TAP WORKIN' AT THE HUNT AND FISH CLUB. NOW, THREE YEARS OF LISTENIN' TO GOOMBA GIBBERISH, AND LAST NIGHT ON THE WIRE, I HEAR SOMETHING THAT I HAVE NEVER EVER HEARD BEFORE, A SANCTIONED HIT ORDERED BY THE OLD MAN HIMSELF ON A WOMAN. NOW, WE'RE TRYING TO LOCATE HER, NOW. IT'S A MARIA, MARISSA? MARITZA FLORES. OH, THAT'S RIGHT, I FORGOT, YOU'RE THE PHYSIC DETECTIVE. SHE WORKS AS A MAID AT THE KELLER HOTEL. SHE MIGHT BE A WITNESS TO THE MURDER OF SUZANNE TAYLOR. WELL, SHE'S ABOUT TO BE A WITNESS TO ANOTHER MURDER, HER OWN. HELLO, REED. YEAH, I KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS. Det. Kurtz: HOLD ON. PROFACI, YOU GOT A MINUTE? WHY? COME ON, LET'S GO SOMEWHERE PRIVATE. I GOTTA CALL YOU BACK. YEAH, LET'S GO IN THE BACK. Det. Profaci: PRIVATE ENOUGH FOR YOU? WHAT'S UP? Det. Logan: I JUST LEFT REED OVER IN FORENSICS. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE PRINTS FROM THE KELLER. DID I TELL YOU THAT REED EVEN GOT THE PRINTS OFF THE MATTRESS MY VICTIM WAS KILLED ON? YEAH, WELL THAT REED'S A REAL LAB RAT. YEAH. YOUR PRINTS, MY PRINTS, FRANKIE'S, THEY WERE ALL ELIMINATION PRINTS. REED WASN'T TOO HAPPY. SHE SAID WE SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL AT A CRIME SCENE. MAYBE WE BETTER GO BACK TO THE ACADEMY, HUH? WE WERE ALL IN THAT ROOM TOGETHER AT THE HOTEL. SO, I WASN'T EVEN THINKING ABOUT ELIMINATION PRINTS TILL LAST NIGHT. YOU KNOW, I WAS CONCENTRATING ON THE PRINTS THAT DIDN'T BELONG TO US. SO, THEN I GET THE ELIMINATION PRINTS. AND THERE IT IS, NAME PROFACI, PRINT LOCATION, MATTRESS. I DON'T FOLLOW. SO, I TOUCHED A MATTRESS. NO, YOU DIDN'T, TONY. WAIT A MINUTE, YOU'RE TELLING ME I DIDN'T TOUCH A MATTRESS, HUH? YOU'RE SO DAMN SURE I DIDN'T TOUCH A MATTRESS? WHAT, ARE YOU WATCHING ME EVERY SECOND? THE MATTRESS ON THE BED WAS NEW. THE MATTRESS I'M TALKING ABOUT, THE ONE SUZANNE TAYLOR WAS MURDERED ON, WE FOUND OUTSIDE THE KELLER BEHIND A DUMPSTER. LET ME SEE THAT. YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT YOUR PRINTS ARE DOING ON A MATTRESS WE FOUND AFTER YOU LEFT? INTERNAL AFFAIRS IS GONNA BE HERE ANY MINUTE. THEY DON'T HAVE A NAME, BUT THEY GOT A TAPE. THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ON THAT TAPE ABOUT A DIRTY COP IN THE 2-7. WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE IS THE COP'S PRINTS ON A MATTRESS. I USED TO RUN INTO OLD MAN UZIELLI AT AL'S CLAM BAR. COPS AND WISE GUYS... ALL LIKE RATS IN THE SAME MAZE. WE EAT IN THE SAME RESTAURANTS. HANG OUT IN THE SAME BARS. SLEEP WITH THE SAME WOMEN. SO, ONE DAY THE OLD MAN ASKED ME TO FIX A SPEEDING TICKET FOR GIANNI. NEXT DAY I GET A LITTLE ENVELOPE IN THE MAIL, NO RETURN ADDRESS, 300 CASH INSIDE. ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M LOOKING OUT FOR THIS KID LIKE HE'S MY OWN BROTHER, MIKE. OKAY-- SO, I.A.B. CATCHES YOUR HAND IN THE TILL. A LOT OF COPS HAVE BEEN CAUGHT WITH THEIR HAND IN THE TILL, BUT NOT A LOT OF COPS HAVE BEEN CAUGHT KILLING A PREGNANT WOMAN. I DIDN'T KILL HER. I'M LISTENING TO YOU. GIANNI WAS ALWAYS SMALL STUFF. UNTIL I WALKED IN THE ROOM THAT NIGHT. KINGSTON HAD BROUGHT THE GIRL OVER TO THE HOTEL. KINGSTON THERE, TOO? NO, NO, NO, JUST GIANNI. HE WAS STANDING THERE BY THE BED. HE WAS-HE WAS COVERED IN BLOOD. I SAYS, GIANNI, "WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING?" HE SAYS TO ME, "THE BITCH "WOULDN'T GET AN ABORTION, "SO, I GAVE HER ONE." HE TOLD ME HE'D KILL ME IF I DIDN'T HELP HIM GET RID OF THE BODY. HEY, I BELIEVED HIM AFTER WHAT HE DID TO THE GIRL. ANYWAY, I WAS ALREADY IN SO DEEP. THE GIRL WAS ALREADY DEAD. GIANNI CUT HER HANDS OFF. CRAZY BASTARD SAID NO COPS I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WHEN I SAW THE SISTER HERE. YOU KNOW, FOR-FOR A MINUTE I THOUGHT THAT-- GOD ALMIGHTY, PROFACI. OF ALL THE COPS I EVER KNEW, YOU'RE THE LAST I FIGURE WOULD EVEN TAKE A CENT. I'M LOOKING AT SAMMY KURTZ THE WHOLE TIME. AND YOU KNOW ME. YOU KNOW I NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YES, SIR, YOU TELL ME WHY. SHIRLEY AND ME, WE WANTED TO HAVE KIDS, BUT SHE-SHE COULDN'T GET PREGNANT. SO, WE TRIED THE IN VITRO FERTILIZATION, THAT'S TWELVE G'S A POP. INSURANCE DON'T COVER IT. SO, WE HAD TO USE OUR SAVINGS. THE FIRST ONE DIDN'T TAKE. YOU SEE THE IRONY HERE, MIKE? TO GET RID OF A DEAD GIRL WITH A DEAD FETUS WHEN THE ONLY THING THAT I-- ME AND SHIRLEY WANT... ...IS A CHILD.
