(dramatic music) - Our father who is in heaven, hallowed to be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done. - on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation and deliver us from evil. - Hey. (door shutting) - Hello? Anyone? - [Recorder] Dear Theophilus. (guards shouting) [Temple Guard] Clear. It's empty. - No sign of the fisherman, sir. He's not here. - Move on, we keep moving. (panting heavily) - [Recorder] Clear, it's empty They knew we'd come here. - No sign of the fisherman sir, he's not here. - Move on, we keep looking - He can't have gone far. - The fisherman. - Feeling lost, Luke? - Magdalene, you, you really scared me there. I didn't hear you. - Sorry, yeah. I guess being lied in our face is part of the job these days and it's Mary, please. - Oh, Mary, sorry. Where is everyone? - Oh, they'll be at the next safe house. We move after a raid like that. I saw you headed in this direction, I just followed you, waited for the guards to leave. - Oh, right. - Sorry, I guess they didn't have time to officially brief you before Paul's arrest. - Yeah, I guess not. - Well, not to worry, we're safe now by God's grace, ah. Let's go. - To the next safe house? - Yeah, we're just gonna make a quick pit stop on the way. - Wait, Mary, what pit stop? - There's a small family that I talked to that wanna hear about him. - But what about the raids? It's too dangerous out there. The most logical thing to do is head to next safe house. - But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise. God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. Yeah, it's your Paul's, it's making the rounds. Listen Doc, ever since I met Jesus, there's been nothing but danger and trouble practically every day. It can't have been that much different, you traveling here with Paul. We're on a mission. Jesus was very clear, tell his story to all the world, even a small gathering. So that is what I'm going to do. Are you coming? - Can I take notes? - Hi, welcome, come in. - So, the brothers do as Jesus says. They put their nets down in that water one last time. Then suddenly, the boat begins to tip. Oh, and the nets begin to break. They have caught so many fish, they have to call their friends over to help. And ever since that day, they decided to follow Jesus like we do right now. The end. - Another story, another one! - That's enough Benni, sorry I know you have to go. - No, that's okay. Would you like to hear a story that Jesus told us? - Yes. - Yeah? Let me think, oh, oh. Now this one's a little bit confusing so you're going to have to listen really closely. There was once a sower who sowed their seed. Now, some of those seeds fell on good ground, some fell among thorns, and some fell on shallow ground while others fell along the roadside. - Excuse me. Sorry to startle you, but there's been a mess with deliveries this morning and I'm afraid that parcel isn't for you. - Yes, but... - I know, I know, but as long as you've not taken it inside, this doesn't have to be a problem. - All right, good, sure, thank you. - No need to thank us, just doing what we do. You have a nice day now. - You too. (phone ringing) - Hey babe, you haven't sent me a present, have you? - [Joy] Chantel? - Joy? You all right? - [Joy] He's left me. - He hasn't. - [Joy] I dunno, I dunno. - Right, where are you? - [Joy] I've gone to the club. - Okay, stay there, I'll be right over. - Excuse me, sorry to startle you. There's been a mess up with deliveries this morning and I'm afraid to say that parcel isn't for you. - Oh no, this one's okay. It's got my name on it. - Sorry miss, I've been asked to recover everything that's been delivered this morning. - Well, then I'm gonna have to talk to your supervisor. What's their number? - I'm afraid, that's not possible. He's out of the area at the moment. - Well, then have a nice day. - To the single life. A mysterious present. - I know, I just heard the doorbell ring and there it was on my doormat. - So what actually is it? - I have not opened it yet. - Sorry, I don't mean to bother you, but did you say you got a random gift? - Yeah, yeah, I did, why? - I'm guessing you haven't heard then. - Heard what? What's this? - You really have to be careful with stuff like this. - Oh, my days. - For what? - [Mysterious Man] There's been a string of these gifts randomly left outside people's houses and they are dangerous. Let's not hold back here. - [Radio Presenter] Oh, okay, okay. For the sake of being devil's advocate, it can't be that bad. - [Mysterious Man] I'm afraid to say it is, lives are at stake here. - I'll get rid of it. - You can't. We've been advised not to take them inside. Contact the authorities if you find them, they'll remove it. Do not take it inside. - What can I do? - You haven't opened it? - No she hasn't. - [Radio Presenter] And what if someone has taken it inside by mistake, what can they do? - Well, this is where it gets tricky. Go home, make sure no one sees you and hide it. Put it somewhere where you forget you ever had it. - The loft. - Perfect. And you have my word, I won't tell another soul. - [Mysterious Man] Don't tell anyone you have it. And most importantly, whatever you do, do not open it. - Thank you, thank you so much. - No need to thank me. Just doing what we do. - Well, please join me in thanking our special guest this morning. - [Mysterious Man] No need to thank, just doing what we... (phone ringing) - Yeah, what? Now? Oh yeah, yeah, I know. Just, I'll be right there. - What's going on? - I see what you mean about his charm. - Who is this? - A consultant clearing up your mess. - Yesterday, you filed important paperwork, correct? - Yeah, what about it? - Tell me this, how did you fail to mention the key witness of the defense? No, that, that, that's impossible, I didn't. - I wouldn't if I were you, trust me, she wanted you fired but I think we all deserve that second chance. Don't you? Look, I may have found a way around this. It's not a moment to lose. So why don't you to shake and make up, eh? If all goes well, I'll ensure you still make partner. - Thank you, thank you very much. - No need to thank me, just doing what we do. Good book? What, this, oh, this is a, this is nothing. - Good, let's not lose sight of what's important. - No, no, no time for reading now. - No time at all. - [Voice On The Phone] Hello, and thank you for calling. How may we help you today? - Hey, I don't, sorry, I'm new to this. - [Voice] That's not to worry. You can take as long as you need. In the meantime, you can ask any questions you might have... - I'd like to order more copies of the book. I got sent one randomly and I really think more people need to read it. - [Voice] That's fantastic to hear, I completely agree. And just between you and me, it wasn't random. - Oh no, it was... I guess not. - [Voice] Okay, so how many would you like? 60, 30? - 100 if that's okay. - [Voice] Perfect, that'll be with you in three days. - Great, my address is... - [Voice] Don't worry, we know. - Yeah, of course, sorry. How much will that be then? - [Voice] Again, don't worry, it's paid for. - Right, well thank you. I guess that's it, have a great evening. - [Speaker] You too, take care now. (dramatic music) - [PA Announcement] Attention. The court of the Gentiles... - Are you alright? - I'm not used to all this running and hiding, it puts me on edge. - Did you enjoy the meeting though? - Yeah, it was good and nice of you to include that story for the children at the end. - Oh, actually that was more for the adults in the room. - Really? - Yeah, what did you make of it? - Well, it was the sowing and the seeds. - The sowing of the seed, you didn't understand it? - No, I didn't. - That's okay. To be honest, we didn't understand it the first time he told it, no, he had to explain it to us afterwards in private. - So wait, Jesus would tell this story to everyone? - He told lots of stories. He'd talk like that all the time. He'd leave half of his listeners baffled, enraged the ministers and then leave us to figure out what those stories meant. - But why? - Why what? - Why teach with stories? Doesn't that make everything confusing? - You should know, right? That's what you are doing, writing his story. - No, no, no, no. This is for a friend back home. A report, more of a report, words, the facts. - Okay, can I give you some advice? Facts are good. And words, they can impact a moment, but a story, a really good story, that can change a life. Come on, it's just a bit further. (door buzzing) Way - [PA] Truth. - Life. - (Door buzzes - You have a warehouse, how? - Generous donation from the Barnabas family. Have you met James before? - As in Jesus' brother? Yeah, briefly when I first arrived. - They're all waiting in the council room. James is getting worried. - Understandably. - Hi there, Zach. - Luke, good to meet you. - Just through there. Should I? I am... - [Mary] Yes. - Everyone should evacuate before the guard get there. What about Ben's gathering? - No word yet. - Mary, glad to see you're okay. - Any news on what happened today? - I'm still trying to get a full picture, but they hit us hard. Four safe houses breached, another 20 arrested. - We've lost the majority of the food banks in the city center. - Why now? - They're probably still riled up from Paul's antics at the Temple. - No, that was days ago. - Truth is, we don't know. My contacts in the Ministerial Council aren't responding. Everything seems to be in some kind of lockdown. - It just doesn't make any sense. - Unless Paul's giving us up. - He would never do that. - It wouldn't be that surprising, would it? Given his history? - Deborah, bringing up people's history... - James, the last time Paul was here in this very room, he almost split the church. I'm sorry, but I still don't trust the man. - [Luke] It wasn't him. - And you are? - Sorry, hi. - We've met, you traveled with Paul, came with him to the capital last week. - Luke. - Of course, he's gonna say.. - Deborah, please. Well, do you know what's going on? - Maybe. When I was hiding, I heard some of the Temple Guards talking. Sounded like they were searching for someone in particular. The fisherman. - [Temple Guard 1] Clear, it's empty. They knew we would come here. - [Temple Guard 2] No sign of the fisherman, sir. He's not here. - [Temple Guard 1] Move on and keep looking, he can't have gone far. - If he's here, we need to know. Mary, make contact with the remaining safe houses, see if they know anything, find him. - Do you want me to come with? - You'll stay here, Luke. - Yeah, I'll see you again God willing, take care. James, keep it up, don't forget to eat. - Deborah, you and I need to go with strategy for replenishing food supply. David you're on lookout tonight. And Luke, welcome. Zach will show you where you're staying. Try and get a few hours of sleep. You never know what God has planned for tomorrow. - I dunno what I'm doing. Everyone here seems so confident... Sorry, I didn't know if anyone was up here. - Not to worry, just on lookout. I made some coffee if you want some. - No, it's alright, thanks. I'll leave you to it. - Join me, I insist. - I thought David was on watch tonight. - It's been a long day. He could use the break. Here you go. Couldn't sleep? - Something like that. - Anything I can help with? - Well, I could use a comfier bed. No, just homesick, I think. - Luke, I've been doing this a long time. You're side stepping, tell me. - Look, to be honest James, I don't know what I'm doing here. I came up this way with Paul for him to get himself arrested. I thought I could use this time to get to know everyone here, learn more about Jesus, write this thing for someone back home. It's just not that simple. - Tell me why do you think God might have brought you here? What's he trying to give you? - Give me, what do you mean? - It's like this, God gives to us freely and the enemy will try and take what was given away. Our job is to understand what we have received. - The sower. - I'm guessing Mary? She loves those parables. - What about the one who does understand, in the story I mean. - Well, they spread the good news of what has been given a multiply. Maybe that's why you were here. - (Radio beeps) I remember Paul introduced you as a doctor. I'm guessing that's of language. - Medicine. - Oh, wow. I guess this wasn't quite the life you're expecting then. - No, it wasn't. To be honest, traveling with Paul, I really do miss a good bed. - Yeah. - I miss my house, my job, to be honest, there's quite a few things I do miss. What about you? Do you ever regret not going a different way, making some money, buying a place in one of those? - Yeah, sometimes. - Really? - Who wouldn't? But what good is it for someone to gain the world and yet forfeit their very self? - Sorry, I don't quite... - When you look out there, what do you see? - Tall buildings, lights, glamor, I guess. - Likewise, look closer. What do you imagine, I don't know, between the buildings? - People. Staying in bed or getting ready for work, walking in the streets. - Exactly. Always surrounded by the promise of wealth, the glitz and the glamor, working every day to either provide or strive for a better life. Thinking wealth is the answer. There was one young woman who thought the very same. (dramatic music) - Watch it. - Lacey, are you all right? - I'm a mess, but I'm fine. - Some people live on the ground, but them heads are in the clouds. You're gonna go home and get changed? - I can't, I'm gonna be late, I'm gonna be late. Bill, when did this happen? - Well, weekend. - I'm so sorry. - It's not over yet Lacey. - Sorry. - So, the last interview didn't go well? - Yeah, or the one before that. I dunno what it is with me and interviews. They just don't seem to like me. - Oh, redundancy's tough, okay? Don't be so hard on yourself. - Yeah, I can't help it. Family trauma and all of that. That was a joke. - Right, well look, fingers crossed for your interview tomorrow. Okay? It's a good one, I hope they like you. Erm, Lacey, I wanted to... - I'd love to. - Sorry? - What? - I, erm, I wanted to give you this. I know your birthday's coming up and... - Thank you. - It's just something we do at the office, you know? No big deal so... - I'll open it on my birthday. I'll see you next week? - Good day? - How's Aisha? - Well, she's tired, she's moody, and she's obsessed with peanut butter. - Hey Mrs. Jackson. - Bill gimme the number seven. - And for you Lacey? - Two, please. - So the owners have decided to sell this place. - The whole building and we can't afford to buy it from them. So I dunno what's gonna happen with the business. - I dunno why the new owners won't just let you run it as it is. - Well, that's what we're hoping but the way things are around here. - They're driving the community out. - You know, they're making Tim's Butchers a coffee shop. - Pryor Street is becoming offices. - Oh, maybe one of them will give me a job, sorry. - Don't you worry, I'm gonna sort it all out. - The amount of money you spend on your lucky deeds Mrs. Jackson over the years. - Don't you doubt me. I'm gonna change the world. Lacey, any plans for your birthday? - No. - You got to do something. - Do you want anything? - Just some of the millions. - Cheeky from day one, this girl. Bill, keep the change. - Mrs. Jackson. - Yes dear. - You dropped this? - On the house. - No, no, no. - No arguments. - Thank you. (phone alarm) Happy birthday to me. You got this Lacey. - Ms Kazeem? - Hi, yeah, hi. (all cheering) - [Mrs. Jackson] Lacey? - Today might be our lucky day. - Oh, Mrs. Jackson, I can't. - Take it. And you can put that away in the fridge. (door buzzing) - I'll get it. Hey. Everyone, this is David. - Hey David. - Hello David. - This is for you. - Thank you. - Thanks for inviting me. - I'm really glad you came. - Oh, Lacey, you have a boyfriend. Oh, Lacey. - Come on, sit down. ♪ Lacey's got a boyfriend ♪ - Half time is lottery time. - Okay. - Thanks. (TV changes to lottery channel) So... - So? - I actually have been, I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... go out sometime, you know, like a birthday meal or something. That's just something we do at the office, no big deal. - I'd love that actually. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Lacey ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ (all applauding) - Go on Lacey. - I'm thinking, I'm thinking. - Yay!. - Looks like you ended up with a pretty good family. - 46... - Despite all the trauma. - [Speaker] 12, 07, and this week's bonus number 39. - So did you win? - Lacey, hi, me again. Look, I keep missing you when I call. I just want to check in, really, on you. Been a while. Look, I know you don't need your job seekers allowance anymore, but, I know things are different now. Okay? I just hope not too different. Give me a call back. - We've made appropriate investments with mutual funds. - Watch it. - Continue. - As I was saying, Ms Kazeem, we've invested into mutual funds, stocks, ETFs. There's plenty of scope more. What about more property? (upbeat music) (door bell) - Come on in. David. Sorry, I was expecting someone else. - Did think you let me in quite quickly. You look nice. - Oh, thanks, yeah, I'm going to a Gala, raising money for children in India. Oh, sorry for not returning your calls. How did you find where I live? - This house was all over the news and I was in the area so I thought, you know, sorry, it seems a bit weird now. - No, it's fine, it's just, I have to go soon. - Of course, look, I don't wanna take up too much of your time, okay? Look, this probably seems a bit random and you know, there's no easy way to go about it, but we were friends before. - I have a boyfriend. - Right, well, that's good. - He's really quite impressive. He's a CEO, he's got his life together. He's a really good fit for me, sorry. I just thought you'd be over what we, what you thought we had. - I'm not here to ask you out on a date Lacey. - Oh, good. - I'm here for Bill and Aisha and their kids. - I hope you don't mind if I clean while we catch up 'cause the new owners are coming in today and we've been cleaning through the night. - Bill, I'm the owner. I bought the place. I own the building. - Oh my goodness, thank you Lacey. - No Bill, I'm not being clear. I'm turning this place into flats. - I don't understand. - Okay. - He's been meeting me at the Job Seeker's Office. They're really struggling and he's hurt. - I tried to give him money. Don't think that I'm not grateful for all of your help, I really am. And I'm gonna pay you back. This should cover all the chicken and maybe get the kids whatever game they're playing these days. - You took their home and their income Lacey. I think it would really help you know if you just spoke to them and explained. - I'll write the check and you can give it to them. - No. - They're hurt, Lacey. - It's nothing personal. - Nothing personal. Lacey I... This community. We looked after you... with everything, with your job, with your mom and dad. - I don't wanna talk about them. If you don't mind, we'll have to do this another time. You're talking to me about helping others. This event is gonna raise so much money for children in Africa. - You mean India? - Yes David, bye. - Have you spoke to anyone from your birthday since you won the lottery? Why? Look, I know you have money now, okay? But when I was at that party, that flat was so full of life and love. Those people loved you Lacey. - Those people were gonna die poor just like my mom and dad. I never wanted to be like them. I never asked to be like them. Every day it was just the same thing, bus stop, chicken shop, I can't, I got out. - Oh, Lacey. - I got out. - You were richer before. (door banging) (door bell ringing) - I'm coming. (door bell ringing) I'm coming. - Did you know her? - Who? - The woman? - Oh no, no, no. That was just a story Jesus told a group of ministers who kept pestering him about money. He told them where their treasure was, their hearts were also. - Ouch. - Yeah, I don't think they were too happy about it. Did Jesus like telling stories? As a kid, I mean? - Not particularly more than anyone else as far as I can remember. Our mom would tell us stories of King David, Noah, and he'd just listen and smile like the rest of us. - [Radio] Code 12-47, code 12-47. - Come on! - What's happened? - There's been a perimeter breach, we need to leave now. - (in to radio) Me and Luke heading down now. (alarm blaring) - My journal... Luke come on. - I need my journal. - Wait, there's no time. - I can't leave it. - Come on, come on, we gotta go. (power surge) (door slams) (slow creaking sound) (chain rattling) (metal clanging) - FREEZE! - Please, please, please. (Simon laughing) Who's that? - How many times do I have to tell you? It's not funny. - What's going on? - Did he scare you? I'm sorry. You can be ridiculous sometimes. - False alarm, thank God. It was two of our own. Luke, meet Susanna, one of Jesus' earliest followers. - Nice to meet you Luke. - I see you've already met famous Simon Zealotes, one of the 12. - The Zealots are getting restless, and after the raids today, I'm not sure how much longer they'll hold off. They were raided too. - The Temple Guard don't distinguish them from followers of The Way. - The Zealots? - They call themselves freedom fighters, but they're more like armed nationalists, extremists. - Yeah, I know who they are I just don't get... - If they retaliate, we need to keep the city safe. - There's another meeting tomorrow night but they're spooked but we came here in hope of some answers. So what happened today? - This young man overheard the Temple Guard say they'd spotted the fishermen in the city. - Do we know if they caught him? - Sent Mary out to investigate, nothing yet. - No news is good news. - Exactly. Might not have actually been him for we all we know. - It was him. - How are you so sure? - He was due to meet Barnabas today in the capital. - Barnabas? - Wait he's back? - Arrived with his companion four days ago, he's not well, a high fever and some injuries that need looking at. They've been staying at my house. - We need to get back there and explain to them what's happened here. Look, sorry, short visit but God willing... - I'll come with you. - Luke? I'm a doctor maybe I can help Barnabas, see what's wrong unless you have any objections. - Simon, Susanna? - The more the merrier. - It's settled. Look at that, he's already packed. - So this is how you manage to avoid being seen? - Old sewer system, runs under the entire city. - There aren't many that know about them. - And those that do either don't know their way around or are far too self respecting to wade through... (splash) ...whatever it is you imagine you just waded through. - I didn't wanna think about that. - Do you mind if I ask? The zealous, what is it they want? - Well, they say freedom, but... - They want their nation's independence back. Whatever the cost. - Assassinations, riots, you name it. - So why do you go to their meetings? - Well, someone has to reach them. - And they listen to what you have to say? - They listen to Simon. - How come? - I used to be one back in the day. - A zealot? - Yeah. - You were an extremist when he followed Jesus? - No, no. I was when he called me but after I followed him, it just wasn't part of me anymore. - I still don't understand why you'd go back to them. - To tell them about Jesus. - But the things they do, they're relentless on feeling. - And so was I till I saw the bigger picture but if we can get through to them, if they can know him, like I know him, then not only will a lot of other lives be saved but theirs will be too. - So you think everyone will change? - I think anyone can. - None of us are the same since following The Way and through him we do the impossible. We love those different to us as we love ourselves, we see those whose ideals and notions are a world away and we love them as if we were their neighbor. - Their neighbor? What does that mean? - It means sometimes it hurts to love the way Jesus asks us to. - I don't understand. - Susanna, do me a favor. Tell him that story that Jesus told the lawyer. - What? Now? - Yeah, it might distract us from the smell. - Shall I record this? I'm gonna record this. - There was once a man on a certain journey. - Alight James, you coming tonight? - Not here. - Not ever. - See you at midnight. (distant chatter) - Sweet man over a chick, you know?. How many fingers have I got? - Don't know, five? (group laughs) - You know he likes you though, innit? - You're good. Sweet man, look at you bruv. What's wrong with you? Over a chick you know? - Tay, check it out. - Hey white power, you lost? I don't think you got that. Turn around. - What does he think he's playing at? - Oh, I get it. I don't think he understands us. Is that right? Is my accent too hard for you blood? - Tay, I think you're in his way you know. - Mm, silly me. I'll tell you what, if you ask nicely, man might let him through. Well? - Let me through. - Pretty sure he said nicely mate. - You people, you don't wanna mess with me. - You wanna repeat that blood? - Move. - What? - Is that? - That's James. - James? - We don't wanna attract any attention, not here. - Yeah, I know, but it's James and he's hurt. - Go another way. - And what, leave him? - If you wanna end up like him, be my guest. Come on. - Hello? Are you okay? Can you hear me, who did this to you? Okay, save your strength and stay awake. I'm gonna call an ambulance, all right? - No police. - Okay, no police. Let's try and get you sitting up, I think it will... I don't need help... Not from people like you. - My name is Jabari. What's your name? If I don't, it will get infected. This will sting. You need help. - No police. - I know, I know. I have a friend who's a doctor. She can help. - I'm not going anywhere with... - If you don't get help, you will die. I'll drive you. (phone ringing) - [Claire] Hey Jabari, are you okay? - Claire, I need your help. Someone is very hurt and I'm bringing them to you now. - [Claire] Don't be ridiculous, you can't just... - I'm not joking. Please, Claire. - I'll get the spare room ready. - Thank you. - You're going to be okay, just hanging there. - How is he? - He'll be okay, a few cracked ribs but nothing's broken. I'm gonna take the next couple of days off work, watch over him, just to check there's no complications. - I'm sorry, why don't you take this to cover the cost? - I didn't mean that you, Jabari. - I know, enough, please just, if there's anything you need just let me know. - Thank you. - It's okay, can I see him before I go? - He's awake. - Claire will be looking after you over the next few days but I'll be back tomorrow. - James. My name's James. - Good to meet you James. - Thank you. - So who do you think is the man's neighbor? - The one who helped him. - And so we do the same, no matter what we may think of the other. - That's hard. - Yeah, it is. Come on, we've got a long way to go. - It's just us, no need to hide. - I don't know you. - This is Luke. He's a doctor. He's here to help. - I've heard that before. - Calm down. He's a companion of Paul's. Luke, meet John. - You know Paul? - Yeah. I came to the city with him, you? I traveled with him too for a little while. - Well, practically makes us brothers in arms. Nice to meet you John. - Mark. Most people call me John Mark. - We need to see Barnabas, alone. - What are you writing? - Oh, nothing, notes. - Medical? - Oh no, these are stories. - What? Like children's stories? - Kind of, I guess. Yeah, they're all part of a bigger narrative. These are the, well, some of the stories Jesus told to teach, explain, I don't know. But he told them so I'm writing them. - So you are writer as well? - Oh no, I mean, this is meant to be more of... - Can I read it? - Luke, Susanna and I need to head off. So can you go and look at Barnabas. He's... - He's not well. Don't let his happy-go-lucky attitude fool you. - Of course and best of luck with your meeting tonight. - As God wills. - As God wills. (shallow breathing) - Oh, here he is, the famous, Dr. Luke. - Well, I wouldn't say that but it's an honor to finally meet you Barnabas. I've heard so much about you. - Oh, not everything, I hope. Although knowing Paul, it probably would be. - All good things, I assure you. - Oh, well then he left out all the fun bits. (laughs, then coughs) - Sorry. - Not at all, nothing to be sorry about, okay? - Yeah. - So, any ideas why we're not feeling 100%? - On our last mission stop, things didn't go quite to plan. I thought I was over it, but my foot hasn't quite healed yet and things have gotten worse. - Do you mind if I take a look? Yeah, it's definitely your foot, leaving it this long has left you with an infection. Good thing is it's treatable but I am gonna have to cut into it and drain it. - Whatever we need to do Doc, I'm in. - Good because I don't have any anesthetic and I'm gonna need a sharp kitchen knife. - Would any of these do? - Perfect. Thank you. You staying? - No, I'll just be outside if you need me though. - Some people just aren't cut out for the operating room. - Quite, God has made him for something entirely different and truly special. He's why we are here. - How do you mean? - We came back to the capital to meet with Peter. He wants to take John Mark under his wing. - Wait, Peter as in... - Simon Peter, one of the 12, yes. - He's the fisherman. - Well, he was a fisherman, yes. Oh, you mean that codename of sorts? Yes, that's him. The ministers thought it clever to try and hide who they were talking about, but well, we thought it rather obvious. Right, let's get this over, shall we Doc? Are you ready? - Of course, yes. Sorry, I'm ready. So this is probably gonna hurt a fair bit. Best thing to do is keep yourself distracted, keep talking, all right? - Oh yeah, about what? - I don't know, know any of the stories that Jesus told? - Yes, yes. - Great, pick one of those and go with it. Quickly. - Okay, right, good, yes. - The kingdom of heaven is like a man who found a treasure hidden in a field. - Well how much does he want for it? - It's not as simple as that. There wasn't a number. - What do you mean? - He said however much I think it's worth, not a penny more, not a penny less. - What did you tell him? - Ouch! - Keep going, you've got this, okay? You might need to stretch the story out a bit. We got a long way to go. - Morning hun. - Look what Nana found. - Oh, wow, is that for me? - No. - It must be for your sister. What do you think Shay? - Stop being silly, it's for me. - Oh, all right then. - Come on you, let's get you to school. Maybe give that a wash. - Bye dad. - See you. - I'm not sure you've ever been able to surprise me yet. - There's no way you could have known about this place. - Okay, you got me. You surprised me today, well done. - For surprise number two. Bet you weren't expecting that were you? You like it? - It's beautiful. - I just want to say thank you. You made me a better person. You're my best friend. And you've managed those two annoying little rascals. I love you. - I love you too. Never stop surprising Mathew. - To new adventures. - To new adventures. - Hello there, how are you? - Can't complain. - And yet we do. - Yeah, very true. - So what can I do for you today? - Bit of a weird question. Do you know who owns the field over there? - Yes, I do, me. Pretty much everything you can see around here belongs to me, including there's pretty little tractor as I'm sure you'll agree. - Yeah, it's a very attractive tractor. Sorry about the field. - It's for sale. - I'm sorry? - The field and everything in it, it's for sale. That's what you wanted to hear, wasn't it? - Yes it is. Have you had much interest already? - Well, I'd say there was much interest from you, isn't there? - Yeah. How much do you think of selling it for? - Tell you what? Why don't you pay me what you think it's worth and if I agree then it's yours. - What I think is worth? - And not a penny more, and not a penny less. - We need to talk. - What did you tell him? - Nothing yet. - We need to be together on this. - Can I see it? - We'll go tomorrow. - Not a penny more or a penny less? - That's what he said. - Then give it to him. - What? - Everything. - Where are we going? - We're buying a field a few miles from here. - A field? We're not even going to have a house? - No, not at first, but eventually we'll build. - And your granddad's lending us as caravan until we're on our feet again. - Why? - What do you mean why Jamie? - Like why? Did you do something stupid? - No, no, no, it's nothing like that. We found something there. Something that makes this all worthwhile. - What? - It's hard to explain. - Don't treat me like a kid. - We're not treating you like a kid. We're trying to discuss this as a family. Look, you're gonna have to trust us on this. - No, I don't. - Jay? - Beautiful, how much do you want for it? What I need is your signature just here to complete the sale. - Sure. - Completely furnished, what you see is what you get. - Still remember moving in on the day of the wedding. - Don't you start. - Why are we leaving? - I promise, you what comes next it's gonna be more than you can ever imagine. - But I didn't want more. - Neither did we until we saw it, trust us sweetheart. - Come on. - [Matt] Hi there! We're back. - Ah hello again! - What can I do for you today? - We'd like to make you an offer. - Oh, certainly. - Sold. And you'll be wanting the deeds I assume. - Thank you. But, I never told you my name. - Oh, I always make it a priority to know the names of those I'm doing business with and those I'm not. - By the way, we found something. - I know exactly what's in my fields. Who do you think put it there for you? - Thank you. - Why did you want so much for it? - Sorry? - Why did you ask for so much? It cost us everything. - My dear child, I only asked what they thought it was worth. Then I'd decide if it was enough or if it was too much. As it happens, it was exactly right. - And for what? A field. - I think you should go and have a look and if you're not happy, just let me know. - Jay, come on, come on. - What can I do for you young sir? - It wasn't everything. Now, it is. - Now, it is. - Take one of these three times a day for the next couple of weeks, you'll be right as rain. - Oh, good, all done then? - All done. You'll need to keep off that foot for a while. It's not exactly gonna be a comfy walk. That story, it's like yours, isn't it? - How so? - Well, from what I've heard, you gave everything you had away to the church when it first began, everything. Even when it was hardly more than a few thousand people, everyone thought were going mad. You gave it all away for... - The kingdom. - Right. - Paul, didn't spend much time talking about the kingdom, did he? Don't let him fool you. It's only because he's so busy growing it. - I made us some food. - Told you he were special. - [Barnabas] Our father who is in heaven, hallowed would be your name. Your kingdom come. Your will done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us, not into temptation and deliver us from evil. - [Temple Guard] We have you surrounded. - Run, Simon run. - After him. - Barnabas, are you okay? - Get your things. - What? - There isn't much time. They're coming. - Who is? - The Temple Guard, the zealots were found last night and they've taken Susanna. They'll be here next, now get your things. - But what about Simon and the others? - Get your things Mark. At the back of the garden, there's a door onto the street. Keep moving and keep him safe. - What about you? - Speed is not on my side. The least I can do is buy you some time. Mark, let's go. Run and find Peter. - Peter? How? I don't, I dunno how to... - He will guide you, - Mark? - No, God, but you have to listen, listen for his voice. Run. - [Temple Guard] By order of High-Minister Ananias, final warning, open the door. - This way, this way. - They're making their way over the bridge. - [Barnabas] But you have to listen. Listen for his voice. Not in the wind, not in the quakes, nor the fire... but in a gentle whisper. - Luke? - This way, come on. - This way. - That way. - No Luke. That's toward the city center. - Trust me. - Wait. - What? - I don't know. We just need to wait. - Follow me. - Come on. - Thank you. Did Barnabas send you? - No. - What? Who are you? How'd you know where we'd be? - The same way you knew to wait where you were meant to. - Peter. - Mark. It's so good to see you son. - You must be Luke. Mary said to expect you. - She found you. - I certainly did, but stubborn as always he refused to leave the city until he got where he came for. - Where were you? We waited for you for four days and you never came. And now we've left Barnabas. - I'm sorry Mark. I tried to get to both of you, but there were so many guards, more than usual. I was spotted, I am sorry. - Why was security so tight? - High Minister Ananias was on the move heading North to Governor Felix to speak against Paul. - Paul? You know where he is? - He's been kept under guard in Herod's Compound. - Has he been sentenced? - I dunno, but knowing Paul, he's probably making the most of it and preaching to anyone who will hear. - And those that won't. - I have no doubt. - So what's the plan? - For now we rest up. Wait until tomorrow for the search parties to clear then we get outta the capital. We head west to the shores. I have some friends in a small port, we'll get a boat from there. - Okay you, come on let me take a look. No, no arguing, come on lemme see. - You're hurt. - Like I said, I was spotted. - Well, they've stood up. I mean, you're alright, but less of that running next time. - Some nice stitch work there. - Yeah, I'm used to patching up the boys. - You are a doctor, Luke? - Yeah, yeah, I am. - He's also a writer. - Are you now? - No, no, I'm not. - Yes he is. - No, I'm not. I'm not the creative type. - You're always write whenever I see you. - Okay, yeah but they're just reports, research, it's nothing more than that. - Are you good? Are you good? - It's just a hobby. - You know the Holy Spirit tells me otherwise. - No, I'm just a doctor. - No one is just anything, Luke. I might be known now as a preacher, leader, I guess but I'm still a pretty good fisherman. God entrusts us with gifts and talents whether it be medicine, writing, teaching, fishing, whatever it is, but they are not random. They are given intentionally with a purpose and it is our duty to nourish them. And then give back to him. Hiding one away would be like lighting up a lamp and then covering it up. Have you ever heard the story of the Great Maestro and three talented students? (dramatic piano music) - Bravissimo, played with dedication, control and heart, Christopher. - Nailed it, Chris. - Well, I'll just do as Maestro says, play... - Play every day. - My very own parrots, Bekkie, your resilience knows no bounds. You mapped it out with great calculation. Now let the map go and let your hands take you on the journey. Malcolm, you have the heart of an artist, passionate, intense, chaotic. You must tune your instrument to allow the music to shine through. I regret to inform you that this is my final lesson. Don't look so shocked. This day has been coming for a long time. So my final lesson to you, my most devoted students is this, each one of you has been given a great gift, talents of different degrees and of varying amounts. They should not be withheld, contained, set aside for a rainy day, but they should be used, invested, spent. Hold out your hands. Oh, there is an immeasurable gift in each of your hands to be used not only for your own betterment, but for the betterment of others. It is your duty. Enough from me. I have shared all I have with you. And one day I expect to see what you've done with it. Now go forth and share what you have with the world. - The only thing we're gonna be sharing are these coffees. - You don't think Maestro's right Malcolm about bettering the world? - I dunno. Maestro always speaks in riddles so that we go back next week for answers but what we ever get is more riddles. - Well, there's no next week, not anymore. - More time to play, play every day. Come on, you don't really stick to that. - I do. - Yeah, I still struggle to keep up. - But you guys have an innate ability. You both have, they can't take that away. Somebody else could practice their finger exercises as much as they like, but they will never have the raw talent that you have and I have. Don't get me wrong, I have learned a lot from Maestro, a lot, but am I gonna play for any old gig to share my talents? No. Am I gonna practice for my Philharmonic audition? Yeah. Because I know my worth and I'm not gonna share for anything less. - Wait, you have an audition at the Philharmonic? - Yes I do. - Malcolm, congratulations. - That's incredible, well done. - Thank you. - Hello, Mr. Novak. Yeah, it's Chris from Double Clef Magazine, we spoke yesterday. Yeah, I was wondering if you gave any thoughts to that fantastic ... - Hi, can I get you a coffee? - I'm on a call. - Yes, no, I'm fine. Mr. Novak. I'm so sorry but our system seems to have crashed again. Yeah, we we'll call you back. Hey, sorry, I think I came across a bit rude just then. It was nice of you to offer. Would you like a coffee or anything? - Sorry, I'm on a call. - Hello, Mr. Holloway. - Yes, this is Ruth calling from Double Clef Magazine. (soft piano music) - Chris, we'll see you now. - Sorry to hear that, Chris. They don't know what they're missing. - Well, nobody says it's gonna be easy. I mean, if Maestro taught us anything, it was that. - Yeah. - Chris? - Yeah. - This may sound crazy, but hear me out, okay? - Okay. - Maestro told us to share our talents, right? - Yeah. - Well, what if we worked on something together? Not just for us, but something that could end up making a difference to people. - Well, it's a great idea. For the betterment of others. - Exactly. - I just don't think that now is the right time. I mean we're both focusing on big auditions and I don't want us to lose focus. You understand, right? - Yeah, you're right but one day, yeah? - Of course. - Well, keep going. You're great pianist, it will happen. - Yeah, I hope so. - All you got to do is play. - Play everyday. (phone pings) - Malcolm. - Chris. - How are things? Things are good mate, you? - Yeah, no, no, no, can't complain, can't complain. How was that audition for the Philharmonic? - Oh yeah, that didn't work out. Seems like a million years ago. - But you're still playing? - Nope. I'm an all or nothing kind of guy. I work in the city now and things are going very well if I don't say so myself. - Well, that's a shame. What is? - That you don't play. - I don't think so. Anyway, I gotta go. - Yeah, no, it was nice seeing you. - Same. - Chris? - Ruth, hi! These are for you. - Oh, thank you, how lovely. - Yeah, shall we? - Yeah, so what do you do? - For money? Same as you, we work together. - No, I mean, what do you do? None of us are there for the love of selling magazines. Unless you are. - No. - For example, I am an Oscar, Golden Globe, BAFTA, Award winning actress in waiting. - Are you really? - Well, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. - Thank you, you? - I'm a pianist. - Wow. - No, is that you acting or? - No. I actually have a lot of respect for musicians especially pianists, you must work really hard. - Yeah, I try to. Not so much as you. - Oh, it's a little reward at the moment. We must persevere. - To perseverance. - And talent. - Mm, and talent. - Play for me then, Maestro. - No, I'm no Maestro. - Come on, play. (soft piano music) (phone ringing) - Hi Chris, it's Bekkie. This isn't easy to say, it's Maestro. - Can't believe this is happening. - I know, she was an incredible teacher. - She still is, she's not gone yet. - I just hope we can live up to what she wants us to be. Chris? - Mmh? - I've been thinking a lot about that idea I had. Do you remember? Working together? - For the betterment of others? - I know it sounded crazy but I really think it could work. I'm going to produce an album. All of Maestro's favorites recorded by stars, peers, students, not for profit all proceeds to tackling cancer, to help make a real difference. That's exactly the sort of thing Maestro would want us to do, chance for everyone to share their talents. I've spoken to Malcolm, he's keen. - Malcolm's playing again? - Yeah, he is. Are you in? - Me? - Yeah. One day, remember? - I don't do that anymore. - What? - I've been out for some time? I wouldn't be able to commit. I'm sorry Bekkie. - Don't be sorry. It's just a shame. - [Ruth Voicemail Montage] Hi honey, just wondering what time you'll be back tonight. It's been a few late nights in a row. Bekkie and Malcolm came around to see you today. I told you were on a work trip. I really want you to play Chris. Layla and I are going to mom's for the weekend. I'm guessing won't be joining us. Chris, Leila just took our first steps. It's like you blame me that you stopped playing. I never asked you for that. I wanted this to sit in our home and hear you play. Leila has never even heard you play. - Sorry, I'm late home. Don't worry about waiting up. I can sort out my own food. Yeah, I've gotta go. Good for you guys. (soft music) - [Maestro] So my final lesson to you my most devoted students is this, each one of you has been given a great gift, talents of different degrees and of varying amounts. They should not be withheld, contained, set aside for a rainy day, but they should be used, invested, spent. Hold out your hands. Oh, there is an immeasurable gift in each of your hands to be used not only for your own betterment but for the betterment of others. It is your duty. Enough from me. I have shared all I have with you. And one day I expect to see what you've done with it. Now go forth and share what you have with the world. (all goes silent) - [Maestro] Play, play every day. (door banging) - [Temple Guard] Open the door. By order of High Minister Ananias, open the door. - Mary, lock. Lock. - [Temple Guard] Open the door. By order of the Temple, open the door. - Go, go, go. Come on. (Holy Spirit whispers) - Wait there. - Luke! (intense music) (power surge) - [Luke] Here I am. You win, I've been so scared. And I won't pretend that I understand why you seem to be pursuing me but here I am. I don't know what this means but I do know I'm not as afraid anymore. You're not a part of my story, instead, I get to be a part of yours. Your incredible life changing story for yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory. - [Recorder] Forever and ever, Amen. (dramatic music) (birds chirping) - Ah, there it is. - You all right there Peter? (Holy Spirit whispers) - Can you give us a moment? - In our hands are immeasurable gifts. My brother and I used to cast our nets out on shores like this. We'd catch the best fish the sea had to offer. We had a real gift and that is when I met Jesus. And when he called me, he told me I would become a fisher of men and to drop my nets. For three years, we followed him and saw the impossible bend to his every word. So when he asked me to spread his message, to preach to all creation, I gave it everything I had and I saw wonders and miracles and the whole world turn upside down. But when the Spirit whispered John Mark's name in my ear, everything changed. I knew where my attention was needed, to help Mark write it down. The good news of Jesus for the whole world to read. Then something happened, I didn't expect. A few days ago, Mary came to me and told me that Matthew was also writing an account. - Matthew? As in... - And now I meet you and find that you are doing the very same. You know what that tells me? - What? - He's up to something. Our nets, Luke, our nets will be his story. - Ready to go now? We should get going while the coast is clear. - Luke, you coming? - No, I'm not. - What? - I'm heading north to Herod's Compound, try to find Paul. I think that's where the Spirit wants me. - You're going on your own? - Plus, have a story to put together. - So this is it? - For now. - Well, you and Paul, you keep out of trouble. Yeah? Stay safe. - We'll try our best. - God bless you Doc. - I'll catch you up. I wanted to give you this. My way of saying thanks for getting me here. - What are they? Notes of my own that I've written over the years. Bits I've heard from Peter and the others. I thought you might find it useful. - Wait, you do know why Peter called you, right? - Yeah, the Spirit told me and Barnabas a couple of weeks ago. - So you won't be needing these? - I got copies. Mary's gonna give one to Matthew and besides I reckon Peter will remember all we need. - Thanks. - You're a great writer, Luke. I read some of it when you weren't looking. You've got a gift. You're gonna keep some of the short stories in? - Yeah, I think so, include as much as possible, long detailed. How about you? How are you gonna write yours? - Well, it's Peter, so I'm guessing short and snappy. - Great story, either way. - I'll see you around? - Amen. - [Luke] Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. This is the account of Jesus, the Christ. This is his story. This... is his Testament. (dramatic music)
