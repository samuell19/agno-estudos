''There was an island inhabited only by people'' ''It was barren and surrounded by a dead sea'' ''As a ritual, every family must sacrifice one of their daughters to the sea'' Hayat! ''Scales'' Hayat... 12 years later Open the door, Hayat! When will we get rid of her and her troubles? She's scratching... Her usual dirty self. -Don't touch me! -Are you crazy? -Let her go! -Hayat, stop it! Stop it! Help me aunt! I said enough! I put you in here alone to stop you causing any trouble! Listen to me, this is your final warning, understood? What are you looking at? Get back to your work! This girl wasn't supposed to get out of the water. The hunters are back! Clean her, cut her and give every villager his share. You can have the leftovers, coward. Let's go. It's almost a full moon. They'll force you to do it this time. You won't be able to save me. You are my firstborn. Soon your mother will deliver a girl, and we'll be a family again. What if she delivers a boy? I'll deal with it when the time comes. This child deserves to live. To the boat! Go away! I can help too! This is no place for girls. To the boat. Girl... Haven't you caused enough troubles already? Girls like you belong to the Sea Maiden. Only men hunt. It has always been this way. We don't have another choice. Understood? If you really want to help give yourself to the sea as this is the only thing that will provide food to our people. It's a boy. Forgive me. Fatma! -Mama. -Mama. I love you. Oh mighty sea Our sacrifice is small Muthana... From the depth of your water and your sand... Enough. Bless us with your maiden We need her strength We beg you, the drought has worsened Our daughter is in your hands Fatma! Look what she got. -We should take it to the slaughterhouse. -No Wait. Hayat! The boys sleep here. Yaser... You're moving to the boys' quarters. Why? Shall I count the reasons? Girl... If you're looking for trouble, go there. Hayat. We have the courage to sacrifice our daughters for the sea. And we must have even more courage to hunt them. Come on kids. Hayat, jump. Hayat. I'm talking to you! I said jump! -I said jump! -No! You're weak like your father. Keep it up. Yes. The net is moving, it's moving! Together, let's pull together. Hayat, shoot her! Get me a knife. Get me a knife! I don't need it. Arrange the ropes. Arrange them. This girl is bad luck. Did you find anything? Nothing. Throw it. Let go. Let go. Every hunter must know how to shoot. You must learn too. You didn't pull the trigger last time. You have to push firmly. Hold your breath and aim before you shoot. You must have a man's courage. Get to work! Move! There is barely enough food for everyone. Give her a small piece only. -Let's not give her anything at all. -Yes, that's even better. What are you doing? I cut myself. What? Where? There's blood. It's been four days and no catch. Let's go back to the village! -Amer, let's go back! -How can we go back? -How can we go back? -It's enough! -We have no catch! -It's Hayat's fault. -Calm down guys. -She's bad luck. Hayat has nothing to do with it. Calm down. -Do you want the village to starve? -It is her fault. -Find a solution Amer. -Let's go deeper. We might find something. We'll give it more time. They're underneath us. -Stop the boat. -Drop the anchor. Where is Hayat? Where is Hayat? Where is Hayat? Louder! Louder! Louder! I'm sorry Fatma. Hayat is back! Hayat is back! She has a catch! Hayat is back! You always find your way back. The Sea Maidens are gone and they're never coming back. You killed your daughter... that night on the boat. I also watched them eating her. Maybe there was another choice, who knows. Hayat... Hayat... What are we doing here?
