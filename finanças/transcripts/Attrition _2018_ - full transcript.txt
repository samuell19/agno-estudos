The weight of war is a heavy burden to bear. Some say it's a necessity, a stage on which good can triumph over evil. But sometimes the cost is too great to justify the means. Axe. Axe! For all the lines that have been crossed in the name of justice... taking a life for a life will only perpetuate the cycle. The war must be fought from within. It'll take a lifetime to make amends for the terrible things I've done. I take refuge in the Buddha. I take refuge in the Dharma. I take refuge in the Sangha. The corruption of our world is diluvian in proportions, in places like Mong La, where the wicked run rampant. Human trafficking trade is estimated at $32 billion per annum. Animal trafficking is estimated at $23 billion per annum. Narco trafficking is estimated at $150 billion per annum. How do you combat evil when the whole world has lost its way? And in a place like Mong La, a border town of ungoverned criminals? Why can't you just sit down? The doctor is coming very soon, and he's gonna see everyone, everyone. Please just... Okay, just line here. You just stay here, okay? Sit up. Mm-hmm. Sit down here. Line up here. And the doctor is coming very soon, okay? Everybody, don't worry. Everything is gonna be fine. He cannot see everyone at the same time, right? Please. Please wait. He's coming soon, okay? Please wait. Please wait. Everybody, don't worry. Don't worry. He's gonna see every single of you. Good morning. Good morning. Who's next? Mr. Jok. Chen Man is here to see you. Double-palm po pai strike. - Forgot that one. - You always did. Come, sit down. Let's have some cha. Have you seen Sifu? Do you think I can help him? You should go see him. I will. We will. We'll go together. Why? You never got to learn? I think he just liked me more than he liked you. Is it true that Sifu gave your mother the entire form? How close? I know I'm not supposed to make jokes about your mother. I'm sorry. Now? According to the words of our great master, "Unless you have emptiness and complete calm, the butterfly will leave." You see? He never left. So about the second half of the form. I'm gonna show it to you next time. Why not now? - Well... - Because you have patients. And you need to have patience. Next time, then. Thanks for the first half of the form at least. I owe you, Axe. And where do I go to collect? Oh. Chen Man Karaoke Club. Is that as exciting as it sounds? Maybe more so. Come visit. We are the best blues club in town. - Yeah, and the only one. - That too. Let me know when you have time, Axe, and we can go see Sifu together. For sure. We'll do that. He has been watching you all morning. He never answers when I speak to him. His name is Wai. Well, I was hoping he would tell me that. He can't. He can't talk. Why is that? He's from a very poor family. His father lost his job and started drinking heavily. There was a tragedy in this village before you arrived. One night robbers came to their house, and they kidnapped his sisters when their father was away. Wai's mother tried to stop them. And they murdered her in front of Wai. The gangs from Mong La have too much power. No one can stop them. Axe, your destiny awaits you. - Please, I need more time. - Don't we all? But I'm not finished, I tell you. And I'm telling you that you are. Come on! You know why the watchmen keep fish here, Mr. Li? They eat the mosquitoes. It's nature's way of dealing with parasites. All I need's for my luck to change. It already did, but for the worst. You know the worst thing that can happen to a bad gambler, Li? It's when the house doesn't care about its money anymore... when you're worth more as an example to others. Please. Please. You can't kill me. I have something, something for your master, for Qmom. Well, all he needs you for is fish food. There is a girl in my village... Master Qmom has more wives than an emperor, Li. Do you think some village whore can do anything? No, no, no. I know Qmom. He's a man of faith. The girl, Tara, she knew things she couldn't know, do things no one can do, and she also has the power of healing. We shall see. We shall see. Huh? Mr. Li. Mr. Li. Yeah, I can. Definitely. No map. My map is here. And my debts, lord... You... will be forgiven? Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I'll give you your duel. I'll allow you to live. But I'll guarantee you that you'll never act this foolish again. What's your name, brother? Nobody fights so well should fight for so little. Actually, I'm very, very close to Mr. Shang. Him and his whole family are very good friends of mine. I pay for his granddaughter to go to school. I take care of their family. But Shang is a proud man. So, for his sake, not for mine, when I go by the store every day, I take a little fruit, a little vegetable, a little bread, for his sake, to give him face. You know, strange or negative words carry great weight. They're like a poison. They carry their own life. Go get me the biggest sack you can find and fill it full of down feathers and carry it to the top of the highest hill you can find and throw all the feathers everywhere in the wind. And come back a week later and find every feather, put it back in the bag and bring me the bag. If you're my student... let this be your first lesson. Nice try. Don't be scared... yet. Sau. Sau. One more person. So, as you can see, she can't really straighten out her neck, so I'm just gonna see if I can relieve this in here a little bit. How's that? Huh? Yeah. - Good. - Looks good. Wai, what happened? What's wrong? What's wrong? Tell me what's wrong. My father has a knife. He going to kill himself. You take me to him. You take me to him. I help you, okay? Come, take me to him. Let's go. Dada! Dada! Please, stop! Please, brother. This isn't the answer. You know nothing. Then tell me. You can tell me. I don't deserve to live. But I cannot die unless I'm brave enough to end it now! Brave is to live through this for him. He needs you. He loves you. I want to die! You have to forget about the past. You have him to live for. I'm not a coward. I will prove it! I will kill you first and then kill myself! Kill me. I give you my life so you can live for him. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. She loves flowers. She said she loves flowers. She loves these. Who are you? I am nothing. I am everything. I am emptiness. The suchness of luminosity unborn and undying. You have turned from you ways of the past, ways of pain and great suffering. You will soon face a crossroad, another chance to save the many you could not save before. You are the only one. Why have you come? It is you who will come to me. Come to me. Come to me. - Sifu? - Ah. A Mr. Yuen here to see you. But we're already closed. I wonder if he could see me tomorrow. I don't think so, Sifu. Okay. I'm sorry to trouble you at such late hour, Sifu. We've come a long way. Come in. Sit down here. Sit here. In the three years I've lived in this village, you've never come to my home before. Something must be troubling you. I have heard many things about you. Like? How you dealt with undesirable people. That was a long time ago. With my money, I can do certain things. With certain things, I am powerless. What is this leading to, brother? Children in our village has been going missing. - Young girls. - How many? From the last two years, seven. As of yesterday, eight. I have three daughters. The two youngest are here. And your oldest daughter? She disappeared two days ago. Tara... Tara... She's special. The whole village has always tried to hide and protect her. Well, in what way is she special? When she was a baby, I noticed certain gifts. At her words, rains come down. From her hand, light can heal. As powerful as Qmom is, he is cursed with a strange sickness. He can no longer walk in the sun. He has to live in the fortress that he's built for himself. And he thinks that your daughter can heal him. Qmom disease will spread like never before. He can walk wherever he wills. More young girls kidnapped, torn from their homes. My people... have lost hope. With all great understanding and compassion of a father and the pain you're going through... - I gave vows... - I have gold. Please. I have land. It's not about money. I don't want money. I don't need money. - I want to... - But you're the only one... But you're the only one I know who can do this. Then you leave me with no choice. Then you take my daughter, because I'm quite sure I will not return alive. Tara... Take the girls home. - I'll get your daughter. - Thank you. Okay. Don't cry. Don't cry. This is Tara. Come on. You daughter was lost. We were merely trying to take her home. What's the problem? You know, this border town, it's got quite a reputation for murderers, rapists, drug dealers, drug addicts. Which one of these categories do you fall under, brah? Is kidnapping your thing? You know, there's no greater evil than those who harm children. You know what I did before I started kidnapping children? No, what did you do? I was a hitman for the Triads. Wow. You are one of those idiots who learn Kung Fu, believing all true power must come from a spiritual foundation. I have learned Kung Fu to kill. Those like me, we will always be much stronger. Our attention is focused on one thing. You, however, are divided into two things... your phony spiritual and your physical technique. You are at a tremendous disadvantage. Our Kung Fu very good Kung Fu. Come with me. I want to teach you something. Yes, Master Chen Man. What's your point? She stole from me! She took my money and ring. That was a precious family heirloom. I care! I want to ask you just one thing, Mei Ling. Do you steal from Mr. How? Yes, sir. Why? I have a daughter. And how old is she? Seven. She has leukemia. I come from deep mountains in the north. They say, with the best medical treatment, it could be curable. But if I don't get her to the better hospital, she will die. Please forgive me. I believe you. This should be enough money for you and your daughter to live a life without want. Take care for your daughter and never leave her side again. Remember, no matter how poor you are and how hard life is, never steal. Set a good example for your daughter. A golden opportunity. When I invited you to visit, I figured we'd just play some music... have a few laughs. Raiding Qmom's place, that's no easy thing. And we know for a fact that this girl Tara is even there? I know she's there. Yeah, take it on faith. So you're finally calling in that marker. That I am, brother. With this, I'm ready for anything. Death by a thousand cuts. I see you keep these blades very sharp. Once a month. Old habits die hard. Old habits die hard. Amazing. Thank you. I only know Qmom by reputation. I know you guys are in the same town, the same business. What's the story with this guy? He control drugs, human trafficking, and extortion. It sounds to me like you think somebody needs to stop this guy anyway, so... Against Qmom, things can turn real hard real quick. That's why we need the right tools and the right people for the job. I know it's you, Infidel. How's the debt-collecting business coming? Never better, but I could sure use a new gig. What's with the freeze frame, guys? Darius is in there, partying like a rock star. So what? And the only people he's letting in are hot girls and pizza-delivery boys. So we're getting the band back together, huh? Looks like it. - Yep. - Okay, brother. So when you gonna pay Mr. Wong back his money, huh? Soon. There's never a pizza guy around when you need one, right? Axe. Axe? Oh. Nothing special, handsome. Just another day in the office. Right. I'll see you there. Sifu, Chen Man and I, we were just traveling through the area. We decided to stop by and see you. You see, the mind is infinite, but the body is finite. That being said, if my eyes don't deceive me, we're gonna have a lot of time to receive your wisdom. Ooh! So this is it? Only three of us? - Oh... - Hollywood. You made it. Hey, big man. So how's the music business? Gone to shit when Motown closed. Why don't we just go find the man with the plan? First up, I know why everybody's here. You're all here because you think you owe me something. You don't owe me nothing. But you owe yourselves the war ethics that we have all created over the years. Don't know about the rest of you, but I'm here because Chan offered me an unlimited bar tab for life. Okay, so we're hitting Qmom's place. This is the only image we have of him. So he's not a target, but he's a very important player. This is the woman we're looking for... early 20s. She's almost certainly being held in the basement of the club, heavily guarded. We're gonna go for the girl. That's why we're here. Chen Man will cover us on the perimeter in and out. My spectacular little brother. All right, Infidel, see if you can get me a detailed map of the joint. On it. Yinying, I want you to go in there dressed as a customer. You can dress like someone real sexy. It's up to you. Hollywood, Scarecrow, I want you guys to run an inventory on what we have and what we need. Copy that. All right, I know I'm asking a lot, but for what it's worth, cause is just, and we are righteous. Bro, I have one question. All right. What the hell is that name... Qmom? I really don't know, but I could introduce you to his mama, and you could ask her. Where do I know that name... Black Claw Ma? I know it. Not in this one, at least not yet. If anybody knows the inner workings of Qmom's place, it's Black Claw Ma. There's two kinds of dogs, Chen. There's the kind of dog that's loyal to his master until the end. And there's the kind of dog that'll bite his master the first chance he gets. We just have to see which kind of dog this guy is. You're still keeping that mystical bell, huh? What medicine are you looking for today? Yeah, but not for me. The wild one. Now I remember you. Axe. Otherwise known as "the Mongkok Demon Slayer." But, you know, Mongkok is in Hong Kong, and we're in Mong La, somewhere in the frontier land between Laos, Cambodia, Thailand. We're in all these places. But I remember you. Black Claw Ma, another face from the past. You were an asshole then, and you're an asshole now. I'm... I'm deeply hurt. Your words deeply hurt me. You really think your teacher would show all his secrets? You know, I'm just a simple country boy. I have no aspirations to be anything great, receive any great teachings or techniques from any great master. I'm simply not worthy. Enough of the history lesson, Axe. Why did you bring me here? Well, you know, the last time I saw you, it seems like you sort of have your head up Qmom's ass, and I wondered if maybe you might like to give a chance to improve the view. So you're offering me a job? It's not exactly a job. It's just sort of an escape plan. You're the one who needs the escape route, Axe. And you're the one that'll need some healing. Call an ambulance. I'll pay for everything. Don't worry, brother. You... You... Infidel, what'd you come up with on the intel? Qmom has a reputation. He's something of a martial arts master. And because he's a master, he won't use guns. The problem is his team does, and they're heavily armed, and that's gonna be a problem. We're gonna try out going in with a soft insertion... cool, calm. And if you hear Miriam say, "Go hard"... it's gonna get hard. Okay, here's how the club works. Only the select few are allowed deep inside, and those that are have to be rich enough, beautiful enough... or powerful enough. Everyone who does get in is divided in three classes of guests. White, you just get access to the main dance floor. Black, you can get into the main one and a second one. With a red bracelet, you get access to the whole club, including private rooms and all the fun things that happen there. How come you didn't get the red one? I didn't get one. I got two. Each room has at least five security guards on site. Each dance floor has its own bartender, each with his own special shaker. I saw these three guys that I tried to follow, but they were all led off into the private area. They got a very strange tattoo. So this is... She's trying to write fire. That's the tribal sign from her father's village. Her father has the same one. Fire and wood. That's proof she is here. There's a private event booked at Baihu tomorrow, which is fewer guests, fewer guards. The thing of it is, is we only have two bracelets. Hollywood and I will use ours to get in the front or back door. My student will let Yinying and Infidel in. One, two, three points in this club is the best place to hide an M4. So we got two restrooms here and here, and they got trashcans in them. Put the upper and lower in there with the ammo. I think that'll work. Okay, so sounds like a plan, everybody. Any questions? I have one question. What exactly is our exit strategy? Well, we're gonna go in like shadows, go out like thunder. I can see the evil that you have committed. Violence for personal gain. The killing of the innocent. Are you not tired of this life of pain and suffering? huh? Tara... Tara... Tara... One more card. The guy at the door is one of Chen Man's students. Brother, go help the others. You don't need me here? It's an order. Yes, sir. Ah! That is to say that the world as we used to know it doesn't exist anymore. It's gone. The traditions, the values, the ethics, the morals given to us by our fathers, by our fathers' fathers, our ancestors, our masters are not rapidly diminishing. They are almost literally gone. Asian martial arts have gone all over the world. But it is at risk of a deep, dark sickness, for there are those who have sought to use their strength and knowledge not for the greater good, but for their own evil ambitions. These are the masterless ones, the ronins, the ones who have broken the lineage. Where those who have the most precious wisdom to leave behind to us have been forsaken, ridiculed, and ignored. Kung Fu is not just for the Chinese. It's for all people, as all martial arts are for all people. Lastly, I just wanted to say, it's been my honor to be alive in a time where real masters have walked here, where I've been able to walk, to listen to them when they've spoken, and they've led all of us to where we are today. All of us in this room, if we can devote every last breaths we have, to the propagation of trying to protect the last bit of unbroken lineage... and commit our lives to helping the innocent, the needy, the defenseless... setting an example of humility and servitude for the generations to come... then Kung Fu may yet survive us all. All of these words today that we've all spoken will have been worth something, and our prayers will not be empty. ♪ I ain't take no tickets this barbeque ♪ ♪ I been down this road before ♪ Whoo, whoo, whoo! ♪ I ain't take no tickets this barbeque ♪ ♪ I been down this road before ♪ ♪ I opened my eyes I saw the light ♪ ♪ I ain't messing with you no more ♪ ♪ I got someone new ♪ You and I are through ♪ But we're cool, baby ♪ We're cool like a polar bear ♪ ♪ When you see my new girlfriend ♪ ♪ You gonna have to change your underwear ♪ ♪ Baby you lie ♪ You don't even ever try ♪ ♪ You lie, you don't even have a shot ♪ ♪ You never work you're always drinking ♪ ♪ You just high, sittin' there thinking ♪ ♪ I said baby ♪ You just say that because you're jealous and bitter ♪ ♪ And that might be because you know I had your sister ♪ ♪ And the baby sitter ♪ But we're cool baby we're cool here in Memphis ♪ ♪ Let me say goodbye and it sound like... ♪
