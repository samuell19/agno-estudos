Thank you for paying a visit to my world. Just as important as what goes into your body is what comes out, and what should come out should be everything you ate. Nothing should be in there lingering around. I know that sounds a bit nasty. The most important step in a detox is elimination. So if you haven't had a bowel movement in a few days, I would first suggest maybe doing an enema to get things out of there. You can do further research to find out more about how to do it. Right after that, the diet has to change the fresh fruits, vegetables, and foods with fiber.

What is your purpose? We are a forgetful people, so many things going on around us that we tend to forget who we truly are. You must always remember that you are beautifully and wonderfully made. Every hair on your head is accounted for. You were created by the divine with purpose, and you must always remember that. I want you to take three pieces of paper and number them from one to three. And on each one, write down something that you never ever want to forget. This is very important. I need you to grab three pieces of paper now and begin to number them one to three. Now write down these things that you never ever want to forget and put them in places that you will see them every single day. This will be the first step to realizing who you truly are.

They're either dwelling on something bad from the past or fearing something that can potentially happen in the future. Anxiety is not caused by any particular situation. Anxiety is caused by how you respond to that situation. How you choose to think about that situation will affect how anxiety will affect you.

(solemn music) Lisa, please don't ask me why I'm sending an email instead of talking to you in person. I tried to muster up the courage over the past few days, but just couldn't. I've been unhappy for a while now, and I'm sure you noticed that pain that I was feeling in my side? Well, apparently it wasn't gas. I just came back from the doctor, and Lisa, I have cancer. (solemn music) I'm so sorry you had to find out like this. I been trying to figure out how to tell you. But the world's not completely over. The good news is that they caught it early and may be able to cut it out. This has just been so overwhelming for me. After my surgery, we're gonna do what you said. I want to start eating healthy too. We can start the journey today. And it has nothing to do with your weight. You know I love you so much and I don't care about your weight at all. Please don't be upset with me for writing. I have the surgery in two days. Maybe we can meet up beforehand and pray. I love you so much, Lisa. Bye for now.
