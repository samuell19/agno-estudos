Sold for 30 francs, to the Vicomte de Chagny. Thank you, sir. A collector's piece indeed Every detail Exactly as she said Will you still play when all the rest of us are dead? Lot 666, then. A chandelier, in pieces. Some of you may recall the strange affair... of the Phantom of the Opera. A mystery never fully explained. We're told, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the very chandelier... which figures in the famous disaster. Our workshops have repaired it... and wired parts of it for the new electric light. Perhaps we can frighten away the ghost of so many years ago... with a little illumination. Gentlemen? From our saviors From our saviors From the enslaving force Of Rome! Madame. With feasting and dancing and song Tonight in celebration We greet the victorious throng Returned to bring salvation! The trumpets of Carthage resound! Hear, Romans, now and tremble! Hark to our step on the ground! Hear the drums, Hannibal comes! You make my dress to long. Sad to return to find the land we love Threatened once more by Roma's far reaching grasp. Gentlemen. Rehearsals as you can see are underway... for a new production of Chalumeau's Hannibal. Monsieur Lefevre, I am rehearsing! Monsieur Reyer, Madame Giry, ladies and gentlemen... please, if I could have your attention, thank you. As you know, there have been rumors of my imminent retirement. I can now tell you that these were all true.. And it is my pleasure to introduce you to the two gentlemen... who now own the Opera Populaire. Monsieur Richard Firmin and Monsieur Gilles Andre. I'm sure you've read of their recent fortune amassed in the junk business. Scrap metal, actually. They must be rich. And we are deeply honored to introduce our new patron... The Vicomte de Chagny. It's such a coup for us, my dear. It's Raoul. Before my father died at the house by the sea... I guess you could say we were childhood sweethearts. He called me Little Lotte. Christine, he's so handsome. My parents and I are honored to support all the arts... especially the world renowned Opera Populaire. Vicomte, gentlemen, Signora Carlotta Giudicelli... our leading soprano for five seasons now. Brava! Signor Ubaldo Piangi. An honor, signor. I believe I'm keeping you from your rehearsal. I will be here this evening to share your great triumph. - My apologies, monsieur. - Thank you, Monsieur La Vicomte. Once more if you please, signor. He love me. He love me. - He wouldn't recognize me. - He didn't see you. If you please. Monsieur. We take particular pride in the excellence of our ballet, monsieur. I see why. Especially that little blonde angel. My daughter, Meg Giry. And that exceptional beauty. No relation, I trust? Christine Daae. Promising talent, Monsieur Firmin. Very promising. Daae, did you say? No relation to the famous Swedish violinist? His only child. Orphaned at seven... when she came to live and train in the ballet dormitories. An orphan, you say? I think of her as a daughter also. Gentlemen, if you would kindly stand to one side. Hannibal's friends! Not on my dress! The trumpeting elephants sound Hear, Romans, now and tremble! Hark to their step on the ground Hear the drums! Hannibal comes! All day! All they want is the dancing! The Vicomte is very excited about tonight's gala. Allora. Allora. I hope he is as excited by dancing girls... as your new managers, because I will not be singing! It's finito. Finished. Get my doggy, bring my doggy. Bye-bye. - What do we do? - Grovel. See you later, I'm going now. It is finished. Great beauty. Princess. Beautiful diva. Goddess of song. Monsieur Reyer... isn't there a marvelous aria for Elissa in Act 3 of Hannibal? - Perhaps the signora... - Yes. But, no! Because I have not my costume for Act 3 because somebody not finish it! And I hate my hat! But, I wonder, signora, as a personal favor... if you would oblige us with a private rendition? Unless, of course, Monsieur Reyer objects. If my managers command. - Monsieur Reyer? - If my diva commands. Yes, I do. Everybody very quiet. Monsieur Lefevre, why exactly are you retiring? - My health. - I see. You as well. Signora? Maestro. Think of me Think of me fondly When we've said goodbye Remember me once in a while Please promise me you'll try When you find that once again you long to take your heart back and be free Signora! He's here. The Phantom of the Opera. Signora, are you all right? Buquet! For God's sake, man, what's going on up there? Please, monsieur, don't look at me. As God's my judge, I wasn't at my post. Please, monsieur, there's no one there. Or if there is... Well, then, it must be a ghost. Signora, these things do happen. For the past three years, these things do happen. And did you stop them from happening? No. And you two, you are as bad as him. "These things do happen?" Until you stop these things from happening... this thing does not happen! Amateurs. Now you see. Bye-bye, I'm really leaving. Gentlemen, good luck. If you need me, I shall be in Australia. Signora Giudicelli, she will be coming back, won't she? You think so, monsieur? I have a message, sir, from the opera ghost. God in heaven, you're all obsessed! - He welcomes you to his opera house. - His opera house? And commands that you continue to leave Box 5 empty... for his use. And reminds you that his salary is due. His salary? Monsieur Lefevre used to give him 20, 000 francs a month. 20, 000 francs? Perhaps you can afford more, with the Vicomte as your patron? Madam, I had hoped to make that announcement public tonight... when the Vicomte was to join us for the gala. But, obviously, we shall now have to cancel... as it appears we have lost our star. But surely there must be an understudy? There is no understudy for La Carlotta. A full house, Andre. We shall have to refund a full house. Christine Daae could sing it, sir. What, a chorus girl? Don't be silly. She has been taking lessons from a great teacher. Who? I don't know his name, monsieur. Let her sing for you, monsieur. She has been well taught. All right. Come on, don't be shy. Come on. Come along. Just... From the beginning of the aria then, please, mademoiselle. Andre, this is doing nothing for my nerves. She's very pretty. Think of me Think of me fondly When we've said goodbye Remember me once in a while Please promise me you'll try When you find that once again You long to take your heart back and be free If you ever find a moment Spare a thought for me We never said our love was evergreen Or as unchanging as the sea But if you can still remember Stop and think of me Think of all the things We've shared and seen Don't think about the way Things might have been Think of me, think of me waking Silent and resigned Imagine me, trying too hard To put you from my mind Recall those days, look back on all those times Think of the things we 'll never do There will never be a day When I won't think of you Can it be? Can it be Christine? Bravo! Long ago, it seems so long ago How young and innocent we were She may not remember me But I remember her Flowers fade, the fruits of summer fade They have their seasons, so do we But please promise me that sometimes You will think of me Brava! Magnifica! Stupenda! Brava Brava, bravissima Christine, Christine Where in the world have you been hiding? Really you were perfect I only wish I knew your secret Who is your great tutor? Meg... when your mother brought me here to live... whenever I'd come down here alone to light a candle for my father... a voice from above... and in my dreams, he was always there. You see... when my father lay dying... he told me I would be protected by an angel. An angel of music. Christine, do you believe? Do you think the spirit of your father is coaching you? Who else, Meg? Who? Father once spoke of an angel I used to dream he 'd appear Now, as I sing, I can sense him And I know he's here Here in this room, he calis me softly Somewhere inside, hiding Somehow, I know, he's always with me He, the unseen genius Christine, you must have been dreaming Stories like this can't come true Christine, you're talking in riddles And it's not like you Angel of Music, guide and guardian Grant to me your glory Who is this angel? This Angel of Music, hide no longer Secret and strange angel He's with me even now Your hands are cold All around me Your face, Christine, it's white It frightens me Don't be frightened No! No! You did very well, my dear. He is pleased with you. Ah Vicomte. I think we've made quite a discovery with Miss Daae. Perhaps we could present her to you, dear Vicomte? Gentlemen, if you wouldn't mind... this is one visit I should prefer to make unaccompanied. Thank you. - It would appear they've met before. - Yes. "Little Lotte let her mind wander." "Little Lotte thought." "Am I fonder of dolls, or of goblins, or shoes?" Raoul. "Or of riddles, or frocks?" Those picnics in the attic. "Or of chocolates?" Father playing the violin. As we read to each other dark stories of the North. No. "What I love best," Lotte said... "is when I'm asleep in my bed." And the Angel of Music sings songs in my head The Angel of Music sings songs in my head You sang like an angel tonight. Father said... "When I'm in heaven, child..." "I will send the Angel of Music to you." Well, father is dead, Raoul... and I have been visited by the Angel of Music. No doubt of it. - And now we go to supper. - No, Raoul. The Angel of Music is very strict. - Well, I shan't keep you up late. - Raoul, no. You must change. I'll order my carriage. Two minutes, Little Lotte. No. Raoul, wait! Insolent boy, this slave of fashion Basking in your glory Ignorant fool, this brave, young suitor Sharing in my triumph Angel, I hear you Speak, I listen Stay by my side, guide me Angel, my soul was weak, forgive me Enter at last, Master Flattering child, you shall know me See why in shadow I hide Look at your face in the mirror I am there inside! Angel of Music, guide and guardian Grant to me your glory Angel of Music, hide no longer Come to me, strange angel I am your Angel of Music Come to me, Angel of Music Whose is that voice? Who is that in there? I am your Angel of Music Come to me Angel of Music In sleep he sang to me In dreams he came That voice which calls to me And speaks my name And do I dream again? For now I find The Phantom of the Opera is there Inside my mind Sing once again with me Our strange duet My power over you Grows stronger yet And though you turn from me To glance behind The Phantom of the Opera is there Inside your mind Those who have seen your face Draw back in fear I am the mask you wear It's me they hear - Your spirit and my voice - My spirit and your voice In one combined The Phantom of the Opera is there Inside my mind He's there, the Phantom of the Opera Sing, my Angel of Music Sing, my angel Sing for me Sing, my angel Sing for me! I have brought you To the seat of sweet music's throne To this kingdom where all must pay homage to music Music You have come here For one purpose and one alone Since the moment I first heard you sing I have needed you with me to serve me to sing For my music My music Nighttime sharpens Heightens each sensation Darkness stirs And wakes imagination Silently the senses Abandon their defenses Slowly, gently Night unfurls its splendor Grasp it, sense it Tremulous and tender Turn your face away From the garish light of day Turn your thoughts away From cold, unfeeling light And listen to the music of the night Close your eyes and surrender To your darkest dreams Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before Close your eyes Let your spirit start To soar And you'll live as you've never lived Before Softly, deftly Music shall caress you Hear it, feel it Secretly possess you Open up your mind Let your fantasies unwind In this darkness that you know You cannot fight The darkness of the music of the night Let your mind start a journey Through a strange, new world Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before Let your soul take you Where you long to be Only then can you belong To me Floating, falling Sweet intoxication Touch me, trust me Savor each sensation Let the dream begin Let your darker side give in To the power of the music That I write The power of the music of the night You alone Can make my song take flight Help me make The music of the Night Christine? Like yellow parchment in his skin. A great black hole serves as the nose that never grew. You must be always on your guard. Or he will catch you with his magical lasso. Oh, my! Those who speak of what they know Find, too late, that prudent silence is wise Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue Keep your hand at the level of your eyes I remember there was mist Swirling mist upon a vast glassy lake There were candles all around And on the lake there was a boat And in the boat there was a man Who was that shape in the shadows? Whose is the face in the mask? Damn you! You little prying Pandora! You little demon! Is this what you wanted to see? Curse you! You little lying Delilah! You little viper! Now you cannot ever be free! Damn you! Curse you! Stranger than you dreamt it Can you even dare to look Or bear to think of me This loathsome gargoyle who burns in hell But secretly yearns for heaven secretly Secretly Christine Fear can turn to love You'll learn to see, to find the man Behind the monster This repulsive carcass Who seems a beast But secretly dreams of beauty Secretly, secretly Oh, Christine Come, we must return. Those two fools who run my theater will be missing you. "Mystery after gala night" It says, "Mystery of soprano's flight!" "Mystified," all the papers say "We are mystified. We suspect foul play!" Bad news on soprano scene, first Carlotta, now Christine! Still at least the seats get sold Gossip's worth its weight in gold What a way to run a business Spare me these unending trials Half your cast disappears but the crowd still cheers Opera! To hell with Gluck and Handel have a scandal And you're sure to have a hit! Damnable! Will they all walk out? This is damnable! Andre, please don't shout, it's publicity And the take is vast Free publicity! But we have no cast! Andre, have you seen the queue? It seems you've got one too "Dear Andre, what a charming gala" "Christine was, in a word, sublime" "We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left" "On that note, the diva's a disaster" "Must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime?" "Dear Firmin, just a brief reminder" "My salary has not been paid" "Send it care of the Ghost, by return of post" "P. T O." "No one likes a debtor so it's better" "if my orders are obeyed!" Who would have the gall to send this? Someone with a puerile brain These are both signed "O. G." Who the hell is he? Opera Ghost! - It's nothing short of shocking - He is mocking our position - In addition he wants money - What a funny apparition To expect a large retainer, nothing plainer - he is clearly quite insane - Where is she? - You mean Carlotta? - I mean Miss Daae. - Where is she? - Well, how should we know? I want an answer I take it that you sent me this note - What's all this nonsense? - Of course not! - Don't look at us - She's not with you, then? Of course not - We 're in the dark - Monsieur, don't argue Isn't this the letter you wrote? And what is it that we 're meant to have wrote? Written "Do not fear for Miss Daae." "The Angel of Music has her under his wing." "Make no attempt to see her again." If you didn't write it, then who did? - Where is he? - Welcome back - Your precious patron, where is he? - What is it now? I have your letter a letter which I rather resent! - And did you send it? - Of course not - As if he would! - You didn't send it? - Of course not! - What's going on? You dare to tell me that this is not the letter you sent? And what is it that I'm meant to have sent? "Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered." "Christine Daae will be singing on your behalf tonight." "Be prepared for a great misfortune..." "should you attempt to take her place." Far too many notes for my taste And most of them about Christine! All we've heard since we came is Miss Daae's name Miss Daae has returned I hope no worse for wear, as far as we 're concerned Where precisely is she now? I thought it best she was alone She needed rest May I see her? No, monsieur, she will see no one Will she sing? - Here, I have a note - Let me see it! Please. "Gentlemen, I have now sent you several notes of amiable nature..." "detailing how my theater is to be run." "You have not followed my instructions." "I shall give you one last chance." Christine Daae has returned to you And I am anxious her career should progress in the new production of Il Muto You will therefore cast Carlotta as the pageboy And put Miss Daae in the role of Countess The role which Miss Daae plays Calis for charm and appeal The role of the pageboy is silent which makes my casting, in a word ideal I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in Box 5... which will be kept empty for me. Should these commands be ignored... a disaster beyond your imagination will occur. I remain, gentlemen, your obedient servant, O. G. - Christine - Whatever next? - It's all a ploy to help Christine! - This is insane I know who sent this The Vicomte, her lover! Indeed? Can you believe this? Signora O Traditori! You are our star! And always will be! Signora - The man is mad! - We don't take orders! Miss Daae will be playing the pageboy the silent role Carlotta will be playing the lead! It's useless trying to appease me Appease her You're only saying this to please me! I will not listen. You thus insult the honor of your prima donna? Padre mio! Dio! Who scorn his word, beware to those The angel sees, the angel knows You have rebuked me! Signora, pardon us You have replaced me! Please, signora, we beseech you This hour shall see your darkest fears Where did she go? Signora, sing for us Don't be a martyr What new surprises lie in store? Would you please give this to Miss Daae? Miss Daae? Your public needs you. We need you, too. Would you not rather have your precious little ingenue? Signora, no. The world wants you Prima donna First lady of the stage Your devotees are on their knees To implore you Can you bow out when they're shouting your name? Think of how they all adore you Prima donna enchant us once again Think of your muse And of the queues round the theater! Can you deny us the triumph in store? Sing, prima donna once more Christine spoke of an angel Prima donna, your song shall live again Think of your public! She has heard the voice of the angel Think of their cry of undying support We get our opera She gets her limelight Leading ladies are a trial Prima donna Your song shall never die Orders! Warnings! Lunatic demands are regular occurrences Think how you'll shine in that final encore Surely there 'll be further scenes worse than this I must see these demands are rejected Who 'd believe a diva happy to relieve a chorus girl Who's gone and slept with the patron? Raoul and the soubrette, entwined in love's duet! Although he may demur, he must have been with her You'd never get away with all this in a play But if it's loudly sung, and in a foreign tongue It's just the sort of story audiences adore - In fact, a perfect opera! - For, if his curse is on the opera Prima donna the world is at your feet A nation waits and how it hates to be cheated Light up the stage with that age old rapport Sing Prima donna once more! Go on, go. They say that this youth has set my lady's heart aflame His Lordship sure would die of shock His Lordship is a laughing stock! Should be suspect her God protect her! Shame! Shame! Shame! This faithless lady's bound for Hades Shame! Shame! Shame! Serafimo, your disguise is perfect Why, who can this be? Gentle wife, admit your loving husband That's exactly the sort of thing the public loves. My love, I am called to England on affairs of state And must leave you with your new maid Though I would happily take the maid with me. The old fool is leaving. It's the Countess de Charbourg! She's invited us to her salon, you know. Nothing like that ever happened to us in the junk business. Scrap metal. Serafimo, away with this pretence You cannot speak, but kiss me in my husband's absence Poor fool, he makes me laugh Time I tried to get a better better half Poor fool, he doesn't know If he knew the truth, he 'd never ever go Did I not instruct that Box 5 was to be kept empty? He's here, the Phantom of the Opera. It's him. Your part is silent, little toad. A toad, madam? Perhaps it is you who are the toad. Why you spray on my chin all the time? Serafimo, away with this pretence You cannot speak, but kiss me in my... Gentlemen, please. Poor fool, he makes me laugh She's lost her voice. Mother! Bring the curtain in, please, will you? Get off. Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize. The performance will continue in ten minutes' time... when the role of the Countess will be played by Miss Daae. Thank you. Go, hurry up. Until then, we would crave your indulgence for a few moments. Meanwhile, we'd like to give you the ballet... - from Act 3 of tonight's opera. - What? Maestro, the ballet. Bring it forward, please. - The ballet. - The ballet, now, please! Page one. No, page 192. Thank you. You're fired. - Are you all right? - Raoul, we're not safe here. Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats. Do not panic. It's simply an accident. An accident. - Why have you brought me here? - We can't go back there - We must return - He'll kill you! - His eyes will find us there - Christine, don't say that - Those eyes that burn - Don't even think it If he has to kill a thousand men Forget this waking nightmare - The Phantom of the Opera will kill - The Phantom is a fable And kill again There is no Phantom of the Opera My God who is this man Who hunts to kill? This mask of death - I can't escape from him - Whose is this voice you hear I never will With every breath And in this labyrinth Where night is blind The Phantom of the Opera is here Inside my mind There is no Phantom of the Opera Raoul, I've been there To his world of unending night To a world where the daylight dissolves into darkness Darkness Raoul, I've seen him Can I ever forget that sight? Can I ever escape from that face? So distorted, deformed It was hardly a face in that darkness Darkness But his voice filled my spirit with a strange, sweet sound In that night there was music in my mind And through music my soul began To soar And I heard as I'd never heard before What you heard was a dream and nothing more Yet in his eyes All the sadness of the world Those pleading eyes That both threaten and adore Christine, Christine Christine. No more talk of darkness Forget these wide-eyed fears I'm here Nothing can harm you My words will warm and calm you Let me be your freedom Let daylight dry your tears I'm here, with you, beside you To guard you and to guide you Say you love me every waking moment Turn my head with talk of summertime Say you need me with you now and always Promise me that all you say is true That's all I ask of you Let me be your shelter Let me be your light You're safe, no one will find you Your fears are far behind you All I want is freedom A world with no more night And you, always beside me To hold me and to hide me Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime Let me lead you from your solitude Say you need me with you here, beside you Anywhere you go let me go too Christine, that's all I ask of you Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime Say the word and I will follow you Share each day with me each night, each morning Say you love me You know I do Love me That's all I ask of you Anywhere you go Let me go too Love me That's all I ask of you I must go They'll wonder where I am Come with me, Raoul! Christine, I love you! Order your fine horses Be with them at the door And soon you'll be beside me You'll guard me, and you'll guide me I gave you my music Made your song take wing And now, how you've repaid me Denied me and betrayed me He was bound to love you When he heard you sing Christine Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime Say the word and I will follow you Share each day with me each night, each morning You will curse the day you did not do All that the Phantom asked of you - Monsieur Andre. - Monsieur Firmin. Dear Andre, what a splendid party The prologue to a bright New Year Quite a night, I'm impressed Well, one does one's best Here's to us The toast of all the city What a pity that the Phantom can't be here! Masquerade! Paper faces on parade Masquerade! Hide your face, so the world will never find you Masquerade! Every face a different shade Masquerade! Look around, there's another mask behind you Flash of mauve, splash of puce Fool and king, ghoul and goose Green and black, queen and priest Trace of rouge, face of beast Faces Take your turn, take a ride on the merry-go-round in an inhuman race Eye of gold, thigh of blue True is false, who is who? Curl of lip, swirl of gown Ace of hearts, face of clown Faces Drink it in, drink it up Till you've drowned In the light, in the sound But who can name the face? Masquerade! Grinning yellows, spinning reds Masquerade! Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you! Masquerade! Burning glances, turning heads Masquerade!

Look, your future bride. - Just think of it. - But why is it secret? What have we to hide? You promised me. No, Raoul. Please don't. They'll see. Well then let them see. It's an engagement, not a crime. Christine, what are you afraid of? - Let's not argue - Let's not argue - Please pretend - I can only hope - You will understand in time - I'll understand in time Masquerade!

Why so silent, good messieurs? Did you think that I had left you for good? Have you missed me, good messieurs? I have written you an opera! Here I bring the finished score Don Juan Triumphant! Fondest greetings to you all A few instructions just before rehearsal starts Carlotta must be taught to act Not her normal trick of strutting round the stage Our Don Juan must lose some weight It's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age And my managers must learn that their place is in an office Not the arts As for our star, Miss Christine Daae No doubt she 'll do her best It's true her voice is good She knows, though should she wish to excel She has much still to learn If pride will let her return to me Her teacher Her teacher Your chains are still mine You belong to me Madame Giry. Please, monsieur, I know no more than anyone else. That's not true. Monsieur, don't ask. There have been too many accidents. Accidents? Please, Madame Giry, for all of our sakes. Very well. It was years ago. There was a travelling fair in the city. Gypsies. I was very young. Studying to be a ballerina. One of many. Living in the dormitories of the opera house. See the wonder from the East. Come. Come. Come inside. Come and see the devil's child. Devil's child. Murderer. Which way? That way. He's getting away. I hid him from the world and its cruelties He has known nothing else of life since then... except this opera house. It was his playground... and now his artistic domain. He's a genius. He's an architect and designer. He's a composer and a magician. A genius, monsieur. But clearly, Madame Giry, genius has turned to madness. - Monsieur. - Where to, mademoiselle? The cemetery. To my father's grave, please. Where have they gone? The cemetery. In sleep he sang to me In dreams he came That voice which calls to me And speaks my name Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing. Her father promised her that he would send her the Angel of Music. Her father promised her. Her father promised her. You were once My one companion You were all that mattered You were once A friend and father Then my world was shattered Wishing you were somehow here again Wishing you were somehow near Sometimes it seemed If I just dreamed Somehow you would be here Wishing I could hear your voice again Knowing that I never would Dreaming of you Won 't help me to do All that I dreamed I could Passing bells and sculpted angels Cold and monumental Seem for you The wrong companions You were warm and gentle Too many years fighting back tears Why can't the past just die? Wishing you were somehow here again Knowing we must say goodbye Try to forgive Teach me to live Give me the strength to try No more memories No more silent tears No more gazing across the wasted years Help me say Goodbye Help me say Goodbye Wandering child, so lost so helpless Yearning for my guidance Angel or father? Friend or phantom? Who is it there staring? Have you forgotten your angel? Angel, oh, speak what endless longings Echo in this whisper Too long you've wandered in winter Far from my fathering gaze Wildly my mind beats against you - You resist yet your soul obeys - Yet the soul obeys - Angel of Music, you denied me - Angel of Music, I denied you Turning from true beauty - Angel of Music, do not shun me - Angel of Music, do not shatter Come to your strange angel I am your Angel of Music Come to me, Angel of Music No, Christine! Wait! Wait! Raoul. Whatever you believe, this man, this thing is not your father. No, Raoul. No. Not like this. Now, let it be war upon you both. We have all been blind And yet the answer is staring us in the face This could be the chance to ensnare our clever friend - We 're listening - Go on We shall play his game Perform his work, but remember we hold the ace For, if Miss Daae sings, he is certain to attend We are certain the doors are barred - We are certain the police are there - We are certain they're armed The curtain falls, his reign will end! Raoul, I'm frightened. Don't make me do this. Raoul, it scares me. Don't put me through this ordeal by fire. He'll take me. I know. We'll be parted forever. He won't let me go. What I once used to dream I now dread. If he finds me, it won't ever end. And he 'll always be there singing songs in my head He 'll always be there singing songs in my head You said yourself He was nothing but a man Yet while he lives He will haunt us Till we 're dead Twisted every way what answer can I give? Am I to risk my life to win the chance to live? Can I betray the man who once inspired my voice? Do I become his prey? Do I have any choice? He kills without a thought he murders all that's good I know I can't refuse and yet, I wish I could Oh, God, if I agree, what horrors wait for me In this, the Phantom's Opera Christine, Christine Don't think that I don't care But every hope and every prayer Rests on you now Seal my fate tonight I hate to have to cut the fun short But the joke's wearing thin Let the audience in Let my opera begin Here the sire may serve the dam Here the master takes his meat Here the sacrificial lamb Utters one despairing bleat Poor young maiden! For the thrill on your tongue of stolen sweets You will have to pay the bill Tangled in the winding sheets Serve the meal and serve the maid Serve the meal and serve the maid Serve the master so that when tables, plans and maids are laid Don Juan triumphs Once again! Passirino, faithful friend Once again recite the plan Your young guest believes I'm you I, the master, you, the man When you met, you wore my cloak, she could not have seen your face She believes she dines with me in her master's borrowed place Furtively we 'll scoff and quaff stealing what, in truth, is mine When it's late and modesty starts to mellow with the wine You come home! I use your voice, slam the door like crack of doom! I shall say, "Come hide with me!" "Where?" "Of course my room!" Poor thing hasn't got a chance Here's my hat, my cloak and sword Conquest is assured If I do not forget myself and laugh No thoughts within her head But thoughts of joy No dreams within her heart But dreams of love Master Passirino Go away for the trap is set And waits for its prey You have come here In pursuit of your deepest urge In pursuit of that wish which till now Has been silent Silent I have brought you That our passions may fuse and merge In your mind you've already succumbed to me Dropped all defenses completely succumbed to me Now you are here with me No second thoughts You've decided Decided Past the point of no return No backward glances Our games of make-believe are at an end Past all thought of if or when No use resisting Abandon thought And let the dream descend What raging fire shall flood the soul? What rich desire unlocks its door? What sweet seduction lies before us? Past the point of no return The final threshold What warm unspoken secrets will we learn? Beyond the point of no Return You have brought me To that moment when words run dry To that moment when speech disappears Into silence Silence I have come here Hardly knowing the reason why In my mind I've already imagined Our bodies entwining Defenseless and silent Now I am here with you No second thoughts I've decided Decided Past the point of no return No going back now Our passion play has now at last begun Past all thought of right or wrong One final question How long should we two wait before we 're one? When will the blood begin to race? The sleeping bud burst into bloom? When will the flames at last consume us? Past the point of no return The final threshold The bridge is crossed So stand and watch it burn We've passed the point of no Return Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime Lead me save me from my solitude Say you want me with you here beside you Anywhere you go let me go too Christine That's all I ask of Oh, my God, no. Piangi, my love! Mi amore! Oh, my God! We're ruined, Andre. Ruined. Where did he take her? Come with me, monsieur. I will take you to him. But remember, keep your hand at the level of your eyes. I'll come with you. No, Meg, no. You must stay here. Come with me, monsieur. Do as I say. No. Down once more to the dungeons of my black despair Down we plunge to the prison of my mind Down that path into darkness deep as hell Why you ask was I bound and chained in this cold and dismal place? Not for any mortal sin but the wickedness of my abhorrent face Track down this murderer! He must be found! Hounded out by everyone Met with hatred everywhere No kind words from anyone No compassion anywhere Christine Why? Why? Keep your hand at the level of your eyes This is as far as I dare go. Thank you. Have you gorged yourself at last in your lust for blood? Am I now to be prey to your lust for flesh? That fate which condemns me to wallow in blood Has also denied me the joys of the flesh This face, the infection which poisons our love This face which earned a mother's fear and loathing A mask My first unfeeling scrap of clothing Pity comes too late Turn around and face your fate An eternity of this Before your eyes This haunted face Holds no horror for me now It's in your soul That the true distortion lies Wait, I think, my dear, we have a guest! - Sir. - Raoul. This is indeed an unparalleled delight! I had rather hoped that you would come And now, my wish comes true - You have truly made my night - Let me go Free her Do what you like, only free her Have you no pity? Your lover makes a passionate plea - Please, Raoul, it's useless - I love her Does that mean nothing? I love her Show some compassion The world showed no compassion to me. Christine Let me see her Be my guest, sir Monsieur, I bid you welcome Did you think that I would harm her? Why would I make her pay for the sins which are yours? Order your fine horses now Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes Nothing can save you now, except perhaps Christine Start a new life with me Buy his freedom with your love Refuse me and you send your lover to his death This is the choice This is the point of no return The tears I might have shed for your dark fate Grow cold and turn to tears of hate Christine, forgive me, please forgive me - I did it all for you - Farewell, my fallen idol... and false friend Too late for turning back Too late for prayers and useless pity - Say you love him - All hope of cries for help And my life is over No point in fighting - For either way you choose - Either way you choose - You cannot win - He has to win So do you end your days with me Or do you send him to his grave? Why make her lie to you to save me? - Past the point of no return - Angel of Music Christine, say no Don't throw your life away for my sake His life is now the prize which you must earn I fought so hard to free you - You've passed the point of no Return - Angel of Music You deceived me I gave you my mind blindly. You try my patience. Make your choice. Pitiful creature of darkness what kind of life have you known? God give me courage to show you you are not alone Take her, forget me. Forget all of this. Leave me alone. Forget all you've seen. Go now, don't let them find you. Take the boat. Swear to me never to tell... The secrets you know of the angel in hell. The Phantom of the Opera is there deep down below Go now go now and leave me Masquerade Paper faces on parade Masquerade Hide your face, so the world will never find you Christine, I love you Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime Say the word and I will follow you Share each day with me each night, each morning You alone can make my song take flight It's over now The music Of the night Child of the wilderness Born into emptiness Learn to be lonely Learn to find your way in darkness Who will be there for you? Comfort and care for you? Learn to be lonely Learn to be your one companion Never dream that out in the world There are arms to hold you You've always known Your heart was on its own So laugh in your loneliness Child of the wilderness Learn to be lonely Learn how to love Life that is lived alone Learn to be lonely Life can be lived Life can be loved alone
