No, Jake, not tonight. I'm just too busy. Okay, call you later. Mr. and Mrs. Berg? Please, we would really like to adopt. What made you wait so long? There are a lot of other couples ahead of you, and considering your age I must advise you that it is our policy to find younger couples for our children. But we thought that if we. 12 years ago, we lost our son and his family in an accident. We're just now ready to start over again. We just recently sold our business, and we're really quite well off, as you can see. And now we have the time and the love to give to these children. I have to tell you, I don't think there's much of a chance of adoption in your case, but I'll see what I can do. Please, we can give them a lovely home. Yes, yes, I understand. Come on, momma. Hi, mom. It looks wonderful. - Mom. - Mommy. Mom, are you okay? - Mommy. - Please get up. Get up, please. Hello? Daddy? Mommy fell down again. She isn't getting up. I'm on my way. Yes, I'll charter a plane. I'm calling Dr. Scott. So, help you mother and leave the front door open, okay? That's right. Leave it open for the doctor. He'll be there, and I'll be home in a few hours. You got that? Okay. Help mommy and wait for the doctor. Okay, I'll take care of my sister. Okay, please hurry. I'm afraid. I'll be home real soon. Okay, I love you. Mommy, daddy's on his way. Sally, Jess, come closer. Give me a big hug. I want you two to be very brave right now. Take care of yourself and your father while I'm gone. Stay together as a family. Where are you going? I wanna go with you. Shh, honey, don't cry. I'm going to a beautiful place where love and peace exist. Don't worry, you'll be okay. You can't die. Son, only the body dies, remember? We are spirit. We'll never die. As long as you think of me in your heart, I will be with you always. I love you. I love you. Mayday, mayday, this 5-0-7 Romeo delta out of Los Angeles with passenger Peter Davis. I'm just south of hell's canyon here. My right engine's on fire. The wind's too strong. We're losin' altitude. My controls aren't respondin'. Oh, my god. Come in, 5-0-7 Romeo delta, come in, come in. Sheriff Walker, please, emergency. I can't feel my hands. I know, I know. Take it easy, Michelle. Everything will be all right. Take it easy. Easy, girl, easy, easy. Easy now, come on, just hold still, Michelle. I know, I know. Easy, easy. Your mother's very, very sick. I think it's an aneurysm so I'm taking her to the hospital immediately. On the way over, I called an ambulance. It'll be here in a few minutes. Take it easy. My hand's numb. I know, I know. You'll be all right. Take it easy. Easy, Michelle. I can't feel my hands. Hello? Hold on. Dr. Scott, it's the sheriff. Okay. Oh, Sally. - This is Dr. Scott, Jake. - Mrs. Davis is seriously ill. Can I help you? There's been a plane crash. I'm afraid Mr. Davis was killed on impact. Oh, no. Mommy. Dear god. Come on, baby. It's okay. It'll all be all right. Your mommy's in a safe, comfortable place. It's okay. Hang in there, honey. They still haven't recovered Peter's body. So you see, Cathy, both parents died practically at the same time. Jess still isn't convinced that his father's dead. He thinks you're just tryin' to take his sister away from him. That's ridiculous. Too bad they don't have any other family. I'll do everything I can for them, of course, but you know, it's really tough to place over kids like the boy. I have no problem with a little girl. We found a nice couple for her, and our office found temporary placement for the boy also. That's terrible. They're good children. They truly love each other and need each other very much. You just can't rip them apart like that. Good lord. I wish I could take them, but I, I'm just never at home. I'm sorry. I'll do all I can. They do seem like lovely children. I'm sure we'll find a proper home for both of them. It may take a little time, but we'll keep working at it. Sally, Jess, come on. Miss kolder, nice to see you again. I believe the papers are ready to sign. May I have the papers for miss kolder please? Just right. Thank you very much. Children? I am sorry. There's nothing I can do for you. Now, children, I want you to listen carefully. I've arranged for you to go back to school starting Monday morning. Your home and all your family possessions are being liquidated and given to that trust at the bank. Now, unfortunately at this time I've not been able to find a home for both of you together so. What is it? I need to go. Go, go where? No, go. No. He has to go to the bathroom. It's down the hall and to your left, and hurry up. Yes? Oh, send them right in. Sally, your new foster parents are on their way in. I want you to be nice to them. Do you understand? Don't worry, darling. I'll see you get together with your brother soon, okay? Miss kolder. You need to take better care of your charges. I found this young man running up and down the hallway all alone. We don't wanna lose any of our little darlings, now do we? I'm sorry, Mr. Dobson. It won't happen again. He was only going to the bathroom, sir. Come in. Sally, this is Mr. and Mrs. Wilson. They've come to take you to your new home. What about me? You can't take my sister away from me. I wanna go with my sister. We are still a family. I'm sorry, young man. This is how it has to be for the moment. But I have to take care of my sister. I promised. She'll be in good hands, Jess. Don't worry. I wanna go with my brother. Look, sweetheart. I wish we could take your brother with us. If everything turns out okay, we can come back in a few months for your brother. Oh, honey, don't cry. I want to go with my brother. Maybe if we allow Jess to walk his sister downstairs, he'll be a good boy. Right, Jess? Jess? Boy, it was sunny a minute ago. Did you bring an umbrella? Yes, we have one in the car. Oh, good. Now, Jess, say goodbye to your sister. Jess. She'll be in good hands. She'll be okay. Now, stop it. She'll be all right. Stop it. Say goodbye. Jess, don't worry. She'll be in good hands. Jess, stop it. Young man, stop this. She'll be fine. Jess, Jess. Jess, stop. Stop it. Damn it. Son of a. Can you grab me a soda? Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah, could you fill it up please? Hey, stop, stop. Sally. Yeah? Christ, come back to the office. I'll handle it from here. Jake please. Go ahead, patch her through. Hi, honey, what's up? I've got problems. The Davis kids just ran off. They were last seen on a motorcycle heading towards farm to market road. With that maniac still out on the loose? Okay, I'll put out an apb right away. Please. Okay. Sally. - Jesse, are you okay? - Yeah. Okay, it's too heavy, Sally. Help me, Sally. Wasted bike. Come on. I wanna go home. Me too, but there's too many people at the house. I miss mommy and daddy.
