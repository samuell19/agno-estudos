- Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - Sir! - Yes. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, Rajiv. Where is Ma'am? - Ma'am is waiting for you. - Thank you. Good morning, ma'am. Good morning, Mr D'costa. - Come. - Thank you, ma'am. - Serve tea to sir too. - Yes, Ma'am. Thank you, again.. ..to give an appointment at such a short notice. I know you wouldn't have asked for an urgent.. ..appointment if it was not too important. Tell me. Ma'am, as per latest intelligence report, Hizbul Al-Qaida has planned terrorist attacks.. ..and targeting many of our important cities. RAW had captured their chief Yakub Habibi two months back. Everyone, please calm down. You can understand how serious the situation is. The public has lost it's patience. We had informed you.. ..that today morning the police received an information from secret source.. ..and had surrounded Yakub Habibi.. ..the leader of Hizbul Al-Qaida and other terrorists ..in a house adjacent to the airport. They managed to escape from there.. ..andentered a famous school in Kolkata. Though most of the students have been evacuated from there.. ..but as per the information that we got from a reliable source.. ..a rehearsal of a skit was going on in the school's auditorium. The terrorist have captivated the students.. ..along with their teachers over there. Keeping in mind the safety of the students.. ..the police are not being able to risk going closer to the school. - The terrorist group, Hizbul Al-Qaida.. - Please, please.. ..has taken the responsibility of the entire incidence and has said that.. ..if arrangements are not made for them to leave.. ..this country without any harm by 5 in the evening.. ..then there'll be a risk to the lives of all those who are trapped inside. The only question is, what will the government do? Will they consider the safety of the children.. ..and accept the demands of the terrorists? Or will they risk the lives of the innocent children.. ..and continue to fight against the terrorists? [indistinct crowd voice] - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - Good morning, sir. - Morning. - Spider. - Sir. Get ready, we need to leave right away. Okay, sir. - Oh God! - What happened? The signs are not good, sir. No, sir. Don't ask me to go right away. I mean, if I leave now then my life will be.. Spider, don't forget, we work for the RAW. You have to leave for Kolkata immediately as Panther needs you. - What happened? - Pan.. Panther sir, please try to understand.. No sir, he is crazy. - Yes. He is crazy. - Yes. He is crazy for this country. India is his life. [indistinct crowd voice] What happened? Why did you stop here? What? Who? What indecency is this? Made me get down from one car in the middle of the road.. - ..and now you are asking me to get into another.. - Sorry sir. Sorry about what? Please come, sir. Please. Sir, you have received the IP address of the school's system in your email. Sir. We have to hack all the CCTV of the school right now. Using one IP address for all.. What a demand! What else can I do other than demanding, sir? After all, you are my senior cadet. Okay, fine. The treatment of always pushing sentiments.. ..I don't like it. I am doing it. Sir, we have very little time. Excellent. Immediately play all these screen displays on Panther's screen. Why Panther? What will Panther do with all this? Try to understand, Spider. The lives of many children are at risk. That's what I am saying. If Panther goes, the risk will increase.. Connect Panther right now. [indistinct crowd voice] Come on. Charge! Hello guys, this is Panther here. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Is everybody ready? Waiting for your order, sir. Now listen to me. I will alight on the roof top and get inside the auditorium. I will eliminate the two rascals present there.. ..and the team will attack after that. Diba. You will get inside the auditorium and take over the charge of the children. - Clear? - Yes, sir. Remember, no one will attack before I attack. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Hello, excuse me.. Ensure that the children are not hurt. Clear? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - Ready, sir. No, sir. I want to say something. - Hello, Panther! Hello! - Yes, Spider. I want to know, what am I doing here? Even if a single grenade comes towards the car.. - ..then what will happen to me? - You will be dead. I will be dead! I didn't study so much so that I will be dead. He simply said, I will be dead. How will you understand what human relations are? You have no family that you will understand family bonding. Spider, a RAW agent is never an orphan. I have learnt to address my country as my mother since I was a child. After joining RAW, Francis sir is our father.. ..figure and according to the great Vivekananda.. ..every Indian is our brother or sister. So no one can be a bigger family man than us. - Are you ready team? - Yes, sir. - If our heart beats, then.. - Jai Hind! - If we breathe, then.. - Jai Hind! - If we bleed, then.. - Jai Hind. Sir. Diba, I'll take care of things over here, you handle things over there.. - Take care of them. - Right, sir. - You go this way and you go there. - Yes, sir. - Don't worry. - Sir. Yes, sir. All garbage clear, we can move now. - Right, sir. - It's okay. Don't worry. - Okay, let's go. Move, move! - Come on, let's go. What is your name? I mean what do I address you as? - What is your name? - Oh! - Zia. - Zia? - Which means source of light. - Yes. Source of light just emits light not darkness. If the hide and seek of this light and darkness stops.. ..then we can leave from here. Darkness! The darkness no longer prevails. You need not fear anymore. - Diva, take them with you. - All right, sir. - Go, everyone is waiting for you. - Yes. Thank you. Where are you going? I will escort them out of the premises safely. Come, let me escort you. - What? - Safely. Why here? Hold it. Don't move. Don't move. This is why I don't want to come to any mission along with you. You were sent here to save the children. That you did. But how can you kill so many people? Spider, keeping them alive is a threat not only.. ..for the 1.34 billion people of our country.. ..but also for the lives of 7.50 billion people of the whole world. But how can you kill them? I have already killed him. Wherever I see these terrorists, I'll kill them right there. That means, you are saying that they should die. Exactly. I too want to say the same. This man is a dangerous person. I won't travel with him in the same car for such a long distance. Shoot him and terminate the mission right now. All work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy. Sitting in front of the computer all day has made you like this. Yakub Habibi. He is the chief of Hizbul Al-Qaida's chief. We'll get the information of all the future attacks if we keep him alive. Hope you understand. - Yes. - Jack. Yeah. Ma'am, as per Intel report.. ..Hizbul Al-Qaida has planned all these.. ..attacks so that Yakub is released. The Deputy chief of Hizbul Al-Qaida, Afzal Faridi.. ..is himself handling the entire mission. So what should we do now? I have activated all the RAW agents. That is definitely not sufficient. I need your permission. I want to meet Yakub in a special cell alone. - But without court orders its.. - Ma'am, we don't have time. That's why I have come to you. Okay. I am sending the information to the special cell. Thank you, ma'am. One more request, ma'am. This meeting of Yakub and me is special. So, I don't want to follow any rules over there. Mr. D'costa, can't you come to me with a decent request? Ma'am! RAW wasn't formed for decent missions. RAW was formed to ensure safety for the country.. ..to ensure safety for it's citizens. All right, Francis. You may proceed the way you want to. But make sure, India doesn't suffer. Switch off all the CCTV cameras installed here. Haven't you received orders from the ministry? - Yes, we have, sir. - Then do what I say. Sir. Greetings, Francis. I knew, you will come here.. ..to meet me. Tell me. When and where will the blasts take place? What do you think? Will you be able to stop these blasts? If you don't release me then your entire country will be destroyed. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me more. Do you think, your country will be saved if you hit me? Today Mumbai will be destroyed. Exactly, three days later it will be Kolkata. And three days after that.. ..it will be Delhi. - Sir. - Panther. Hizbul Al-Qaida has planned an attack in Mumbai today itself. Sir, the agents of our Mumbai wing are already.. ..being posted in all the crowded areas. Don't worry, sir, I am also going out there right away. - Good. - Right, sir. Sir, City Mall's agents have noticed some suspicious activities. - Rush to the City Mall right away. - Yes, sir. Sir, we have arrested 2 people. They had explosives with them. Interrogation is on but they haven't said anything yet. Diba, do whatever is needed to make them talk. Right, sir. Sir, bomb squad and sniffer dogs.. ..will reach here in some time. They are on the way. No need. The public will panic unnecessarily. Whatever needs to be done, are being done by my agents. - Come. - Okay, sir. There. - Yeah. - What? - Sir. Two bombs have been detected. - Yes. There's a possibility that there are more bombs in the mall. Evacuate the mall immediately. - And make sure that nobody gets panicked. Okay? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - Let's go. Move please. Come on, move. Move. Move. Come on, hurry up. [indistinct crowd voice] - Got it? - Yes, sir. - Deactivate it. - Yes, sir. [indistinct crowd voice] Sir, the entire mall has been evacuated. There are no casualties. - Good. - Sir.. ..should I ask our police force to come out too? Mr. Namdev, do you know that we all are a part of the defense force.. ..and it's our duty to protect this country.. ..it's people, and its property? - But sir, if the blast.. - There will be no blast today. Today there won't be any blasts. Today will be the day to diffuse.. ..not just bombs.. ..but the confidence of the terrorist will be diffused too. - Right? - Yes, sir. [indistinct voice] 'I, Hizbul Al-Qaida's acting commander, Afzal Faridi..' '..take complete responsibility of all the blasts..' '..that took place through out Mumbai.' 'And this is just the beginning.' 'We want to tell the Indian government..' '..that if they do not release..' '..our capable Jihadi Yakub Habibi..' '..within the next 72 hours with all due respect..' '..then mark my words, we'll shake up the foundation of India.' 'We will cross all the limits of terrorism.' 'We will destroy each and every city of India.' 'We don't fear death.' 'Just remember, within the next 72 hours.' As per the official data, till now we have.. ..received the confirmation that 170 people are dead. I wonder what will the final tally be? We couldn't understand.. ..that they have planned this kind of serial blasts, ma'am. I am very sorry. You can sit before me and say that you are sorry, Francis. I won't be able to say sorry to the people of our country.. ..who have lost their near and dear ones. Even if you are unable to feel their pain, I can feel it. I understand their pain, ma'am. I know it as I too have lost everything just like them. Everything. No. I cannot take any more risk. Yes, ma'am? Rajiv, connect me to the Prime ministers office. Ma'am, I hope you are not considering the release of Yakub. We have no other choice. Ma'am, please try to understand. If Yakub is released.. ..do you understand how many more terrorist attacks will take place? And if Yakub is not released.. ..then do you have any idea how many more people will loose their lives? No, no. Not possible. I can't take this risk. We are not prepared for any more attacks. Ma'am, no more attacks will happen. I promise. Our best undercover agent, Panther is leading this mission. But, Francis, Panther is a common mortal. Just a mere human being. He is not a super hero. Panther is not a super hero. He is just a mere human being. But he is not less than a super hero. The word failure is not in his dictionary, ma'am. And the most important thing. He got a vital lead about a man named Salim. Maulana Salim Mirza. Apparently, he owns an antique shop at chor bazaar. In 2002, he went to Al Dehra for business.. ..and gets in touch with Hizbul Al-Qaida. Then in 2003, he again goes to Al Dehra.. ..with middle east visa for five months. Most probably for training purpose. He started taking terrorism class over here since 2005. He didn't take much time to brain wash the underage.. ..and innocent youngsters by giving them money. He has created a Robin hood image for himself in Chor bazaar. That means, we will have to face.. ..mass resistance if we try to arrest him from Chor bazaar. Arresting Salim Reza in front of public at Chor bazaar.. ..is next to impossible. - Charlie. - Sir. Seeing our way of work it might seem.. ..that we work while being emotionless. But it's emotion that we have to work with. - Right? - Sir. Thinking about the dead and their families, do you think.. ..anything is next to impossible? Sorry, sir. - If our heart beats, then.. - Jai Hind! - If we breathe, then.. - Jai Hind! - If we bleed, then.. - Jai Hind! Sir, just buy it. It's an awesome set. - It has lollypop android, 3 GB RAM, and 32 GB in-built memory, sir. - Really? Both front and back camera with flash. - You take a photo and check, you will get beautiful pictures. - Okay. Sir, it has body less screen and 4000 MH battery. - Hey, mister! - Yes, sir. What kind of mobile did you sell? It's not even a month and it has stopped working. Have a look! Sir, please wait. Why are you getting so furious? Sir, this is a China product. You don't get guarantee for those, sir. China, Japan, Italy, France. I don't know all that. I had brought it from you. You gave me China mobile. Clean this, then clean that. I had promised that you'll like the set but I didn't give you any guarantee regarding the set. He said, bring the mobile back if anything goes wrong. - So I brought it back. - I am checking it, sir. Why are you getting angry? - Bablu, check the set! - Look mister, I can't charge it.. - ..can't call anyone, nothing is functional. - Just check the problem. Why will Bablu check it? You had given me the mobile, you check it. - Okay sir, I'll check it. - He doesn't even reduce the amount. Is this mobile Bablu's product? - Sir, it's processor is damaged. - What? Let me show you a new mobile. Sir, stop fussing please. It's a new set in the market. An awesome set. Smooth operations. Sir, it has both front and back camera. When you click photos of yourself, you will look like a hero. Won't it conk out? Sir, may your enemy's cell phone conk out. Change my name if the mobile conks out. You are talking too much. It looks good. - Not just looks, it functions well too. - Okay, I am taking this. Sir, what do you mean by taking it? Leave my hand. Sir, who will pay for the phone? This man thinks I am crazy. What do you mean? You are taking the mobile, won't you pay for it? The previous set conked off. He gave me this mobile in exchange of this. How can you run away with my mobile? - Do you think I am crazy? - Why do you sell lousy stuff to people? We are here to do business. You are a menace. Don't act smart with me in my area. Sir, listen.. Forget about the exchange. Watch your steps. Be careful. Will you break it? He was running away with my mobile. - Leave my hand. - What do you mean by leave your hand? - Hit him. - Leave me. - Catch him. - Leave me. Chotu, check what's wrong? Yes, I will check right away. Hit him. Leave me. Leave me. Don't touch me. - Leave me. - Hit him. Target captured. Shut up. Silence, everyone. First, you sell bad quality mobile and on top of that you hit me too. I don't want your mobile. Keep it. Don't ever come back to this area. Get lost! If you come back, I'll break your legs and play Hockey with it. Who had given the orders for the serial blasts? Sir, I don't know anything. Believe me, I don't know anything. I am asking you again. Who gave the orders for the blasts? Sir, I didn't do anything. What are you doing, sir? What are you doing, sir? Sir, I don't know anything. I don't know anything. Believe me, sir. I know that I'm a Muslim and that's why I am being tortured like this. This country can never accept the Muslims. Everyone has equal rights in this country. Be it Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian or any other religion. No. We Muslims, know it well that this.. ..country never treats us as it's own. Shut up, you scoundrel, or else I'll tear your tongue out. By calling yourself a Muslim, don't.. ..degrade the entire Muslim community. You are a terrorist and a terrorist has no religion. Calling himself a Muslim! I am not aware of my religion. But I know this much that for a true Indian.. "Whenever and wherever there is a decline in.." "..religious practice, O descendant of Bharata.." "..and a predominant rise of irreligion, at that time I descend Myself.'' ''For the protection of the good, the destruction of the wicked.. "..and the establishment of righteousness.." "..I am born in every age" is as important as.. ''Allah is the greatest, Allah is the greatest, there is no God but Allah.'' ''And Allah is the greatest, Allah is the greatest and.." "..to Allah belongs all praise." Sir, I don't know anything. Salim. I am asking you for the last time. Tell me the truth. Who had given the orders for the serial blasts? Or else I will leave you in such a state that you won't be.. ..able to say anything through out your life. No. No. Sir, I will tell you everything. I will tell you everything. Sir, as per Salim's confession.. ..Aman Hassan and Samir Hassan had ordered for these attacks. Sir, If we don't catch them, we won't be able to.. ..get to know about their plans regarding the next attacks. And as per information, Aman Hassan and Samir Hassan.. ..have already left for Al-Dera with their family. Ma'am, in Al-Dera Indian Embassy, do we have any.. ..reliable source who can be contacted immediately? It will be too late sir. I am going to Al-Dera. I have already booked my tickets. But Panther, without government.. One day has already past after the Mumbai blast. There will be another serial blast after two days. Are you saying that we will wait for permission even after this? Sir. Sir, you had taught us that nothing is greater than our country. And this mission is for our country. So it's good if our country gives us the.. ..permission for this mission and if it doesn't.. ..then it's even better, sir. - Are you sure, Panther? - Yes. The mission approval is not solely in my hand. And I hope, you are aware of the repercussions of.. ..initiating a mission without government approval. I know, ma'am. The government will not take responsibility.. ..of even a small mistake made by me. And as I'm on this mission without the approval of Indian government, I assume, Al-Dera government also won't support me and that's fine. Actually, ma'am, terrorism is the cancer of modern world politics. And I'll do everything that needs to.. ..be done in order to treat the cancer. Ray, chemotherapy, operation, whatever is needed. I will destroy the cancer affected cell.. ..and will save the non affected cells. Ma'am, I promise, I will uproot terrorism completely. I like your attitude. All the best to you. Thank you, ma'am. - Panther. - Sir. A special friend of mine, Jahangir, will receive you at Al-Dera. - You can depend on him. - Right, sir. I want India safe. India will always be safe, sir. - Jai Hind! - Jai Hind, sir! - Have you ever been to the maze at Lucknow? - Pardon? Actually, it's an Imambara but people know it as a maze. - Have you been there? - No. Why? If you ever visit then you will see that there.. ..are walking paths in between the walls. But if you enter those paths, then you won't be able to come out ever. But as of now I want to get out of this airport. I am coming to that. The formula to get out of the maze is, always turn left. Did you get it? - Are you Jahangir? - Yes. But neither my dad was Akbar, nor is my son Shah Jahan. Come to the parking area. We will meet there. Are you always invisible like this or do you actually appear? Good question. There was a time when I desperately wanted to become Mr India. But that didn't happen. So I try to live like Mr India, as much as I can. Clear? Hi! I am Jahangir. Hi! You must be knowing that we are here on a serious mission. What was the need of this unnecessary build-up? Young man, the build-up was much needed. Recently, I was diagnosed with Diabetes. And my daughter is arriving today from India for her holidays. So I was finishing off the coffee with sugar for the last time.. ..as I won't be able to have this coffee till the time she is around. My black Fortuner is in the parking lot. 35308. You go ahead, I'll come with my daughter. You?! You?! What are you doing here? Just a second. I was asked to sit in this car. Listen, I have had enough. Wherever I go, you follow me and try to put me in trouble. I didn't put you in trouble. I saved you from trouble. I am trying to understand that you.. You have understood a lot. You don't have to try so hard to understand me. Please just go from here. Go. Otherwise.. If not then I will inform the police right away. - I am here. - Here you are! She.. She is my daughter. Zia. Professional dancer. - Dad. - Yes. Dad, please ask this man to go from here. - Why? - Being with this man is like inviting trouble. This was the man in the school too. You don't know how dangerous this man is. It's natural to be dangerous. Because he is Panther. The best undercover agent of RAW. Come, get inside the car. Come along. - Sir. - Yes. Get in the car. Sir. Zia, stop the car. What happened? I will explain everything. Mr Jahangir, I don't have any time at all. Now, I too don't have the time. Zia, move. What does that mean? Where are we going? It's not in our hand now. What do you mean by it's not in our hand? Now we have to follow the car ahead of us. Who's car is it? That car belongs to the embassy of our neighbouring country. - So? - Shafiq Reza is sitting in it. He is the embassy head. Hassan brothers are the most important.. ..issue to our neighboring country now. And if my guess is not wrong, then Shafiq.. ..is going to the new location of the Hassan brothers now. Shafiq is an expert in this kind of unethical notorious tasks. Zia, stop. We have come to the right place. It seems Hassan family is kept in this house. To be sure, we have to get inside this house somehow. You may go if you want to. But please do not involve us in your stupidity. Zia, calm down. Panther, this is Al Dera. The police here do not torture in a decent way. Jahangir, you might not be aware of.. ..the first policy of our RAW founder. That's to keep the words fear, pain and failure out of our dictionary. But you won't understand all this. Let me go. Zia, move. Stop the car. Stop the car please. What is this Jahangir? Jahangir, turn.. Greetings, Aman. Greetings, Shafiq. Is everything well? Yes, brother. - Hope you are not uncomfortable here. - Not at all, brother. Brother! B-B.. He is Samir, my younger brother. Samir, I had told you about Shafiq. He is Shafiq. - Greetings! - Greetings, young man. Hope you all are not uncomfortable here. No, Shafiq, not at all. You are an amazing host. Young man, tell me if you have any problem. It's my responsibility to take care of all your issues. - No, I mean, my wife Tabassum.. - Yes. - We need to take her to a doctor urgently. - I see. I mean, there's still time for her delivery. Just a minute. Delivery? That means your wife is pregnant. Are those medical documents? Yes. What did you just do? It had all the records of my wife's treatment. Our government.. ..is extremely serious about your safety and security. Until yesterday you all were Indian citizen. But from today you all are neither Samir, nor Aman nor Tabassum. You and your family never lived in India. If you have anymore documents with old identity.. ..then destroy them all. Yes, Panther. Sir, I don't need this man named Jahangir. - But, Panther.. - Sir, please allow me to speak. This man has no idea about our organisation. I wonder what he thinks of himself? He behaves as if he is not a RAW agent but the chief of RAW. Calm down, Panther. Calm down. The person about whom you were talking all this while.. - ..do you know his real name? - Yes. It's Jahangir. Wrong. It's a code name. His real name is Feroze Khan. I hope you have heard of him. - Feroze Khan?! - Feroze Khan. You mean, the founder of our organisation, Feroze Khan? Our organisation still works as per the policies made by him. The training procedure that we maintain till today.. ..is made by him. Excuse me. If you are done complaining about my dad.. ..then I need to talk to you regarding an important matter. Sir, I will talk to you later. Tell me. Listen, whatever you want to do with.. ..your life is completely your decision. But please, don't involve my dad in your mess. Throughout my life I have seen my mom live in fear.. ..which lead to heart ailment and after that.. ..everything was finished. I don't want to live in fear like my mom did. Zia, whatever sir has been doing all these years, is all for our country. Our country is.. proud of such a man, Zia. I know. I know that the country should come first. I know this too that I am alive because of you. But seeing you at the airport, I understood.. ..that my dad is not safe anymore. And I also know this that your association.. ..will increase the risk to my dad's life. And I won't allow it. You may call me anti-national, you may call me selfish.. ..you may say whatever you want to. I really don't care. I have lost my mom. And now if my dad is harmed because of you.. ..then I will not spare you. Listen, it's no use telling anything to dad. But I need to tell you. I have no one else other than my dad. And I don't want to be alone. Good afternoon. - Are we going to any desert? - Why? Because no one, other than a business man.. ..dealing in the desserts, uses this compass. Francis was right, you are the best. I don't understand what is best, sir. I always aspire to be better in life. Please come, brother. Thank you, Shafiq. Having my wife checked by the doctor was very important. I had already told you.. ..that I am here to resolve all your problems. Come, let's leave. It won't be right to delay any more. Come. Brother, aren't you coming? No. Aman will stay in Al Dera for few more days. He has some work here. But we have never lived without brother.. Samir! Don't forget that this is a war. And only one person gives order in a war. Rest just follow the orders. Aman has an important work here. He will meet you all later. Brother! What happened, Tabassum? Sir, apart from the embassy guards.. ..I can see just three members from the Hassan family. Please drive faster. It's moving. Where are they being taken? Any idea? Not very far. As per my intuition, their people are somewhere close. They will take the Hassan family to some other place. Aman, don't be upset. Small benefits always had to be.. ..sacrificed for big benefits. - This is the rule of the war. - I know, Shafiq sir. The biggest benefit in the world is money. I can sacrifice.. ..everything for money. Everything. Come on. Sir, the matter is entering a risky zone. It's time for action, sir. Okay, let's go. Sir. Sir, please stay here. I will handle it. Come on. Move. - What are you doing? - Move. Weren't we supposed to go to the hospital? Why did you bring us here? Why don't you say something? Don't hit him. - Please leave him. Don't hit him. - Hit me as much as you want to. - No, no. - Don't do anything to my mom and my wife. I need to take my wife to the doctor. Leave him. - Leave him please. - There's no need for a doctor. We will resolve her sufferings.. ..as well as yours. Who is that? Come on! Drop your gun. Move. Don't do this mistake. You might not know my brother. He, himself, has given the orders of.. ..sending you all to the shelter of Allah. Who are you? Quickly leave from here with your family. - Come on, go. - Are you a Bengali? I am an Indian. Come on, go. Fast. Come on. Hey! Stop! Sir, how come you are here? During a war, even animals don't leave their.. ..fighters alone and we are RAW agents. If our heart beats, then.. - Jai Hind! - If we breathe, then.. - Jai Hind! - If we bleed, then.. Jai Hind! Now I understand, why did Francis name you as Panther. Not Lion, not Cheetah, not Tiger.. ..even more dangerous than all of them is Panther. Sir, no matter how great a student becomes.. ..the teacher is always a teacher. - Let's move. - Sir. Reports have been pouring in about a massive blast.. ..from an abandoned army base in Al Dera. Reports have been poring in about a massive.. ..blast from an abandoned army base in Al Dera. No one knows the motive behind it. Al Dera government has rejected all demands. Just wait. Spider. - Sir. - Do you have any information about Panther? Sir, do you need any information about the.. ..President of America or North Korean President? I am asking for the information about Panther. He is not a person who will be out of track for so long? What a joke, sir! But my track history says that in last 5 years.. ..we spent most of our time in order to track Panther. He is the most irresponsible cadre I have ever seen. - I agree with you. - Then? - I am not disagreeing with you. - How will you do it? - But.. - No ifs and buts. Till date, each and every agent of RAW.. ..is scared of going ahead without the tracking.. ..device of Spider but your Panther.. Till date, he didn't use any of my tracking devices.. ..for any mission. He has such a huge ego. I'm sorry to say. Our organisation stands on a discipline. And Panther is the most indiscipline person. You don't need to worry about Panther's discipline. - Okay. - Just track him. - Okay. - Right now. Any news about Jahangir? No, sir. But we are trying our best. Find him. - As early as possible. - Right, sir. I had warned you. I had told you.. ..not to involve my dad in your mess. But you did exactly that. You made me lonely. - Zia. - Please. You don't have to say anything. Nothing at all. Two of you went on the same mission. You returned.. ..but my dad died. Zia, I have returned just because of your dad. Yes. Zia. And Jahangir sir is not dead. He died as a martyr for our country. Sir.. Sir.. Panther, make sure India stays safe. Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Yes, Zia. We should all be proud of Jahangir sir. Yes. We should all be proud. - I am proud of him. - Yes. I am very proud of him. Panther. Those who have taken away my dad's life.. ..ensure that they don't take away any other Zia's dad. You will punish them. Promise me. Promise me. Panther, are you fine? Yes, sir, I am fine. Panther, you don't sound good. What happened? Sir, Jahangir is no more with us. - I need a favour, sir. - Go on. I need Spider. I know he is the best technical guy. And we need the best people for this mission. I will manage Spider. Whatever it takes, convince him and.. ..send him here as soon as possible. Please. Alright. It will be done. - Thank you, sir. - Hey, Panther. Sir. If our heart beats, then.. Jai Hind! - If we breathe, then.. - Jai Hind! - If we bleed, then.. - Jai Hind! Jai Hind! - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - Good morning, sir. - Morning. - Good morning, sir. - Morning. Get ready, Spider. You have to catch a flight in 2 hours time. Where are we going, sir? Not we, you alone are going. I see. - You have to go to Al Dera. - Al Dera! - Al Dera? - Yes. - That means, Panther? - Panther. Sir, finally in the hands of international criminals.. Spider, before you start reacting, listen to me. - No, sir, you.. - I said, listen.. You listen to me. Sir, there's no question of working with Panther. Last time I was saved because of my luck. But if I go this time then 100%.. I mean, I will be dead. Instead, let me do something. Sir, I resign. No, no, sir. Besides, I have promised my wife that.. ..we will go for an Europe tour next year. Then, if I.. then my wife will be furious, sir. Calm down. I think you should calm down. I can calm down, sir, but working with Panther is.. - Are you sure? - Sir, there's no confusion in this. Okay, then let me inform Panther.. ..as he had made the request. Panther had requested? I mean, for me? Because he thinks you are the best technical guy we have. You mean, Panther told this himself? Even he is the best undercover agent we have. No doubt about it. - Even I feel so. - Well.. And the combination of two best person was much needed for this mission. But when you don't want to work with Panther.. No, no, sir. When Panther has himself agreed that I am the best technical guy.. ..then I can.. ..think of going for this one mission.. ..with him, sir. But, sir.. ..since I am going with Panther.. ..if anything happens to me.. ..please arrange for the Europe tour for my wife. Okay. But who will go along with her? I won't be there so she will go alone. I knew it. He'll bring me here and then play hide and seek. Disgusting man! He might have switched off all the trackers too. I don't know with whom am I stuck with. My name is Spider. My network is spread are all around the world. How many networks will he destroy and how many times will he fool me? Some day, I will definitely.. Hello! Panther. Panther. You have the tracker to track me. But I have the tracker to track your device. I agree you had gifted me this watch in Berlin. But that doesn't means that you will insert a chip in it. That is my work. You must be aware of my work too. No, no, I know I did a big mistake coming here.. ..but that doesn't mean you will bully me.. Get inside. Samir Hassan and his family. They were involved in the Mumbai blast. But they have no more information about the upcoming blasts. Impossible. I don't believe that they don't have any information. - Spider. - Yes? I have done all kind of investigation from my end. They really don't have any more information. Panther, no one gives information just like that. You need to acquire information. Go, try out. - Yes. - Thank you. Hello! Hello! You have no information, right? I mean, they killed so many people without any information. I am telling the truth, sir. I don't know anything. I mean, we just used to follow my brother's orders. I am telling the truth, sir. I just did whatever my elder brother asked me to do. Today onwards, you will do whatever this brother tells you to do. Spectacles. It's a gift. This is a watch. Do you remember? No, right? Panther, what is happening? Sir.. Sir.. - Relax. - Kill us, sir. Kill us all, sir. Sir, if the brother, for whom I did so much, wants to kill us.. ..then we have no right to live, sir. I just have one request. Request? Okay. What request? Sir, take us to our country and kill us. In this country? Sir, I want to die in my own mother land. Before committing the crime he wasn't.. ..even aware that India is his country. Sir, I will die in my country. I just want to say this much. No. These people have no information. Thank you, Spider, for giving us this news. It's okay. I think, we should send them back to India immediately. But it will not be easy to send them back to India now. Shafiq Reza and his men are looking for them like crazy. It's extremely risky to get them out from here. Hearing the word risk.. something happens in my stomach.. Anyway, all this is not my job. Instead, I will go.. Spider, over here, there is nothing like your or mine. Whatever we are doing, we are doing it for our country. We? No, no. What do you mean? We? What do you mean to say? Do you want me to take them with me to India? No. You will make arrangements so that.. ..they are able to get out of this country. I mean, you will prepare their fake documents like visa, passport, etc. I knew it. You will put me in mess when I come here. All these illegal job in a foreign nation.. I can't do it. Spider, please. If you don't help, this mission will not be successful. Why are you requesting like this? If you request like this, I will help right away. I mean, actually, I plan to go.. ..for an Europe tour with my wife next year. But, by getting involved in all this if I.. - Ask him to stop laughing. - Panther. Good luck, brother. What happened? All well? Samir and his family need to be taken to India. And if their tickets are not done secretly.. If Jahangir sir would have been there then today.. I don't know what to do. Don't worry. I have a friend here at Al Dera named Shahida. She works at the airport. I am sure she will definitely book the tickets for India. Wait. Thanks, Shahida. Once their fake passports are ready.. ..we have to send their passport, their details to Shahida. Thanks, Zia. Panther. Thank you. Till today, I had expressed.. ..my demands only to my dad. Today, I demanded something from someone else, for the first time. Thank you for fulfilling my demands.. ..for not letting me be lonely and for everything else. Thanks. How far has the work progressed? Unlike you, I don't work with bullets.. ..but with my brain. It'll take time. Spider, we are short of time. Then do one thing. Let me go. Bring someone else. Anyway, I won't be able to return to my.. ..country after doing all this illegal work. Spider, there is no use returning to our country if we don't accomplish this. What do you want to say? If we can't take them back to our country.. ..then we won't be able to stop the blasts. And if we cannot stop the blasts.. ..we won't be able to face anyone after returning to our country. - Sir. - Yes, Panther. We are sending Samir Hassan and his family to Delhi today itself. Fantastic. But, sir, we couldn't trace Aman Hassan yet. - Panther. - Sir. As per video threat, they'll do a blast at Kolkata tomorrow. And ministry has decided to release Yakub in order to stop that. Don't worry, sir. Panther is on duty. - I know. - Thanks. Sir, Why are there so many people from embassy? They have information that few passengers.. ..are trying to go to India on fake passport. Okay. On which flight? Yes, Shahida? Okay, thanks for the information, Shahida. All okay, Zia? Shafiq Reza and the embassy guards have reached the airport before us. We can't move Samir and his family from Al Dera airport. I knew, being with him will create a.. You can't work with your limbs always. At times, you should also use your brain. They do a government job, They are not.. Shut up, Spider. Look at him. Zia. Is there any flight for Delhi from Bidrid airport? Yes, there is one in a couple of hours. That means, we still have time. Call up Shahida and ask her to book their tickets from that airport. Also inform her that their names shouldn't reflect on the system. Ensure that just the PNR is reflected on the system. - Okay. - And, yes.. She shouldn't cancel the tickets from Al Dera to Delhi. - Alright. - Just speak to her. They are embassy guards. That means, since they didn't find Samir and his family at.. ..Al Dera airport, they are looking for them at all the check posts. Zia, is there any other way to reach Bidrid.. ..airport avoiding all these check posts? No. There's no other way, Panther. There's no other way.. ..but there's an idea. Let me try, Zia. I have a Europe tour ahead. Spider, are you okay? - Water? - Yes. Congratulations, Spider. Finally, you are returning to your country. At least, now I deserve a thanks. No, first let me safely reach Delhi then I will say thanks. You won't get me immediately once you reach Delhi. It's your responsibility to ensure that Samir and his family reach Delhi safely. What the.. No, no, I am not crazy like you. No, in the middle of the road if I am.. Then my heart.. Not the middle of the road, Spider, middle of the sky. And many things can happen in the middle of the sky. Flight can crash in the middle of the sky, you may die. No, no. I don't like the reference of death.. ..besides, I have to take my wife for a Europe tour.. If I knew that you will leave me at middle of the road.. ..like this then I would not have helped.. I mean, I wouldn't have helped you at all. - Okay, where are you going? - Tadzhikistan. - Tad.. - Yes. Spider, your tracking system has failed this time. As per Shahida's information, Aman might have gone to Tadzhikistan. So, I have to go to Tadzhikistan as soon as possible. And, if I am unable.. ..to bring Aman back to our country from Kyrgyzstan within 24 hours.. ..then there may be one more blast. I hope you understand, Spider. Listen, Panther! I understand that the method of our work.. ..is different, so our ways are different too. But we both work for our country, don't we? Today, let me say it once more for our country. If our heart beats, then.. Jai Hind! - If we breathe, then.. - Jai Hind! If we bleed, then.. Jai Hind! All the best, Spider. Take care. Thank you. Goodbye. Panther, boarding passes. Let's go. Yes, come. Stop. Stop the music. - I think something has happened? - Hey, what's happening? Why aren't you listening? I am telling you to dance. Listen, no dance, no money. Do you understand? Dance! Over. Audition over. Those of you are selected.. ..will be uploaded on the website in the evening. Now go. Go. Get away from here please. Why are you two still here? I want them alone. Go, go. Go! Come on, let's go. Sir. She is Zia. Good afternoon, madam. Zia, he is our most interesting RAW agent, Jhunjhun. Why are you embarrassing me, sir? Do you know, madam, since childhood I wanted to become.. ..a backup dancer in Mumbai film industry. But everything changed once I encountered Panther sir. Okay, Jhunjhun, do you have any new information? I have, sir. In a resort near near by.. ..few people from our neighboring country have arrived. And yesterday one more person from Al Dera has joined them. Do you have any information about this new person? I have, sir. Mizba Haque. Yes. He is Aman Hassan. - Aman? - Panther, what should be our next step? - Going to the resort and relaxing. - No, sir. That is not possible. They are not allowing people from outside. Jhunjhun.. ..you are our most interesting.. ..RAW agent. Your audition results will be out today evening, right? Come on, baby. Come on. Wow! Come pretty, baby, come on. Come on. Come. What a nice place! Come on. Come on. Come on, baby. Did anything happen, Panther? Such a tight security can't be only for Aman Hassan. There's definitely something else too. Sir, what are you suspecting? Hizbul Al-Qaida's chief, Yakub Habibi is still in prison. My sixth sense tells me that Aman Hassan.. ..has definitely come here to meet a bigger leader of Hizbul Al-Qaida. If my guess is right, then we will be able.. ..to take one more person from here along with Aman Hassan. Just a second. - Yes, Panther. - Sir. Sir, do you accept buy one get one free offer? I do. It depends on how exciting that offer is. I exactly don't know how exciting, sir. But.. ..someone very very big. If you give me confirmation, I will talk to the ministry. The release order of Yakub is almost ready. Only you are able to null and void this order. Sir, rest assured.. ..since I've already entered the serpent's hole.. ..then no matter how venomous the serpent is.. ..I will return to my country only when I catch him. Greetings, sir. Greetings! Sir, our boys are ready to explode Kolkata. We are just waiting for your orders. The one who couldn't kill his own people.. ..will explode Kolkata? Your mom, your brother.. ..your brother's wife.. ..are still alive. They are in the custody of Indian government. And they must have extracted all the information from them by now. Sir, it will be of no use. No one except me knows about this plan. You can rest assured. My right hand doesn't even trust my left hand. 'We want to give a last warning to the government of India.' 'Out of the 72 hours, 48 hours are about to get over.' 'If our capable Jihadi Yakub Habibi is..' '..not sent across in a special chopper by 8 am tomorrow, then..' '..before the sunset tomorrow..' '..Kolkata will be destroyed.' We have to release Yakub tomorrow morning at 6. Please don't give this release order now. Try to understand my problem. If, somehow, the blast takes place tomorrow you know well.. ..what a dangerous situation that will be. Start the release procedures of Yakub. Zia. Shoot, Zia! Shoot, Zia! I can't. - Shoot, Zia! Zia, shoot! - I can't. Zia, shoot! Zia, please. Zia, shoot! Hold it. Give me the gun. Sir. It will be morning by the time you cross the border. And the documents required to cross the border are in this envelop. And even then if you face any problem.. If there is a problem, there is a solution too. Yes, sir. - Yes, Panther. - Sir. I am returning to the border with Aman Hassan. - Only Aman? - No, sir. There's one more person. Who? The deputy chief of Hizbul Al-Qaida.. - ..Afzal Faridi. - What? Yes, sir. Panther, if you can enter India along with Afzal.. ..then global platform will be compelled.. ..to think about RAW in a different way. But one thing. Yakub will be released by 8 in the morning. You have to enter India before that. At any cost. Your time starts now. Right, sir. Give me your phone please. - Destroy both. - Yes, sir. So that Kyrgyzstan police cannot track us. - Thanks, Jhunjhun. - You are always welcome, sir. - Take care. - All the best. Thanks. - Let's go. - Please come. Sir, CCTV footage is ready. - Did you send it to the border? - Yes, sir. Alert at the border. Whoever has done this shouldn't get to cross the border. - Come on move. - Okay, sir. [indisticnt crowd chatter] - Show me. - Where are you going? Show your passport. What is in there? Come on, show me. What is there inside? Show me. Get down. - What happened? - This is border!! Panther, where are you? What is there in the truck? - Sir, there are Walnuts. - Show it. Sir, please let us go. There are just Walnuts in there. Will you show or do I seize your truck? Come on. - Check throughly. - Yes, sir. - Didn't find anything, sir. - Okay. Let's go. Stop. You check down the truck. Yes, sir. Sir, there's nothing down there. - Okay. - Okay sir, we are leaving. - Go. - Come. - Yes. - Sir! Panther here. Sir, have the machine used to remove oil from Walnut ready. We have to remove a lot of oil. Yes. How did you manage to do it, Panther? Sir, when we reached at the border we noticed that.. ..all the vehicles are being checked thoroughly. The passengers of the bus ahead of us were asked to get down.. ..and the entire bus was checked thoroughly. Right then I thought of a plan. I called uncle Rahim, the driver of the bus.. ..and told him about the issue and requested him. Then with the help of uncle Rahim.. ..I entered India along with Aman Hassan.. ..and Afzal Faridi crossing the border. - 'Thank you, uncle. - What is there to thank?' 'I can give my life for my country.' Yes. Go! Get him out of the chopper.
