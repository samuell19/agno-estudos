I first met him when he turned four. I gave him a bicycle that day. He kept staring at it. He stared at the bike and at me, back and forth. And then he asked: is it for me? His eyes were this big. It's been a long time since I've seen him. How long? Eight years. Hello. May we...? Sure, go ahead. The other day I had an accident you won't believe me. - Wan't me to cut it for you? - OK. I fell asleep at the wheel and suddenly I ran into a whole vegetable stand and everything flew all over the place.
