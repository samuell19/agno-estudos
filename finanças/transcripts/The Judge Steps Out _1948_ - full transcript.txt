Good morning, Parker. - Good morning, Miss Elisabeth. Good morning, Mr Maloney. - Good morning. A fine, brisk morning. - Brisk is right. Good gracious! Mr Maloney. Okay Pete, let's have the drawers. Hey you! Take those pants off. Scram, Danny. We don't laugh at things like that in Boston. Good morning, Judge. - Good morning. Hello Maloney. What are you doing up there? Oh, good morning, Judge. These Harvard boys .. now why would anyone want to do a thing like that? Well, a fellow like Columbus needed a drink after all the years in the square. I think he looked better with the hat on. Good morning, Judge Bailey. Oh, you're kind of early this morning, aren't you? Got to keep the jails full. My, he's a hard-working man. Hello Hector. You are in early. - What have you got there? Just a package. You could have had your second cup of coffee you know. The assignment list isn't out yet. I'm not going to take the Winthrop case if that is what you are hinting at. I've got a little .. repairing to do. What did you say? - I didn't say anything. I sat down on Longfellow this morning. Mrs Bailey claims she's distantly related to Longfellow. Well, that's Emerson. Oh, is that who it is? Ah, it is going to be a nasty case. A shame .. a fine old family. It's a pity. All over the papers. You'll get your picture in there, too. - I will not. I will not handle this one. There's two other probate judges on the bench. That's right. And they'll both see that you get it. [ Telephone ] Hello .. oh yes, just a minute. It's your daughter. What is she doing up so early? Hello Catherine. Oh .. how much? What? Fifty dollars for a hat? What don't I understand? What occasion? But darling, I just can't afford it. No, no. There is no use you coming over here. She's coming over. I suppose you've already bought that new suit you were talking about? Yes. - Well, have you? No, not yet. Of course, it is none of my business, Your Honor. You're lucky you wear a robe on the bench. As bad as that? Alright fellows. He's in. [ Singing: ] "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday Judge Bailey." "Happy birthday to you." I didn't have the slightest idea. You see, he doesn't even know what day it is. What do you expect after ten years on the bench? Have you got it, Hector? We intended this as a small token of our esteem on the occasion of your birthday. But, as it happens .. It will also serve as a symbol of our most sincere congratulations. Oh, that's beautiful. - And deepest sympathy .. On your assignment to the Winthrop case. Oh no. - Yes! Then you admit that between the hours of seven and nine .. You consumed three Daiquiris, two Sidecars and a Rum-Collins. Where were you? Under the table? - Your Honor. Looks like everybody was there that night. Well, if you want to know the truth I didn't have one Rum-Collins. I had two. Does that give the old buzzard the right to take away my kid? I didn't marry him. - Your Honor, please. Look, you've been giving me the works all day now. Who wouldn't take to drink cooped up with a frozen slice of cold-roast Boston? "We don't do this, we don't do that." He drove me crazy, I tell you. Mrs Winthrop, your counsel has probably advised you. And I would certainly like to assure you it would help your case a great deal. If you could bring yourself to behave in the court with patience and courtesy. Your .. mascara is running. Your Honor, it's your daughter. She wants the fifty .. for the hat. What hat? It's a present for my birthday. Isn't that an awful lot of money for a tie? Don't be so stingy. Give her the fifty. That will make sixty altogether. Proceed Mr Holmby. You are the father of Lieutenant Charles Winthrop, deceased? I am. Your Honor, my daughter-in-law described me as a slice of cold-roast Boston. A very graphic metaphor. And I suppose rather apt. But how would you feel if your only son met a girl on a Saturday night .. Married her a week later, and sailed for the Pacific the next morning? Mr Winthrop .. Mister Holmby, I've been making my own mistakes for some time now. My daughter-in-law thinks I'm so selfish as I want my grandson to go to school .. In Boston and then to Harvard, as his father did and mine and his. My son was a boy who showed great promise. He was a soldier and was killed. I should like my grandson to grow up to be like his father. The last letter my son wrote to me .. We received it after we were informed of his death. He said facetiously .. That he couldn't possibly know whether the baby would be a boy or a girl. "I would like you to see that junior gets the helmet I wore the last .." "Game I played." Case will be continued until tomorrow. It's a nice plane. A nice box too. Thank you, Hector. Did Catherine tell you what she was getting for me? - No. Oh, she wouldn't. Goodnight, Hector. - Goodnight, Your Honor. That's sixty I owe you. - A hundred and ten. Oh? - Your wife was in. Oh. I guess Mrs Bailey wanted a new hat too. Oh .. let me have another five. I think I'd better get her a few roses .. goodnight. Evelyn. Evelyn. Catherine. Hello? Yes, Mrs Jorgensen. Is Mrs Bailey in? No, I'm sorry. Mrs Bailey is out for the evening. - Oh. They are both out. - Where did they go? Mrs Bailey called and said they won't be home for dinner. So I said could I have the evening off because of my back and she said alright. Oh, Mrs Bailey said there is a nice piece of cold mutton in the icebox. Thank you. Oh Tom, you still up? Hello dear. Where have you been? Where did you put the cancelled cheques? Are you doing your income-tax again? You poor dear. I wish you'd find them. I want to deduct the contributions. Guess what? - What? We are engaged. - Really? I thought we were married. Very funny. - Who is it this time? John Struthers the third. No. So, she's finally swung it. Does Catherine know? - This time, she told me. Isn't it wonderful? - Oh, I don't know. The Struthers have always struck me as being kind of a shoddy crew. It won't hurt her to be related to one of the finest, noblest families. The Struthers? The Struthers are upstarts. They didn't make their money until the civil war. You and your Pilgrim father. - It makes no difference. I say still they're shoddy. - Who's shoddy? Hello darling. - Hello. Who are the roses for? - Where'd they come from? I bought them. - But Catherine .. Is it our anniversary? It's your birthday! You poor dear. I'm so sorry. They are lovely. It was sweet of you, Tom. Oh Daddy, this is terrible. Well. Are you very happy? - Yes, very. That's grand. It's the way it ought to be. Tom. You married a very clever woman. Do you know what I did today? I saved you $3,000. What's wrong? Be an angel and unbutton me will you. What did you do? I got aunt Esther to give me her Baby Grand for our wedding present. That's a least five hundred. - What else? Well naturally, the piano will need a little overhauling. Then, and this took some manoeuvring. I persuaded Genevieve to give the reception. That's another two thousand. Oh, that's great. Who is Genevieve? - Mrs Struthers. Naturally, we'll have to pay for some extras. But that isn't all. Alright, let's have the rest. - The trousseau. I went to all the stores. Do you know what they want for something with no lace on it? No. - $275. - You didn't pay? Of course not. I wouldn't dream of paying such prices. I found a divine little woman on Freemont Street. How much? - Only $1,100. Eleven hundred? - But Tom, that includes everything. Bridesmaids, nightgowns, everything. Trimmed with French lace. Well. I guess Catherine will just have to march to the altar without lace panties. That isn't Struthers. You're right it isn't. Let's stick to our own level. I've not making a fool of myself keeping up with the Struthers' millions. I knew it. I knew you'd be like this. You don't care if your daughter's married without a stitch on her back. You don't care if I'm humiliated publicly in front of all my friends. Look Evelyn, all your friends know exactly what a Probate Judge gets. All the lace in France won't make them think it is a penny more. That's what's so humiliating. Heaven knows, I've tried. I've tried very hard. Look at the Howards. Have you seen her new stables? They say he won't touch a case for less than $20,000. He was appointed judge the same year you were. Only he quit in time and went with Union Trust. Remember the night I came home and told you to go and see Mr Dobbs? Well, you wouldn't. So they offered it to him. And you still haven't changed. If you had the opportunity today, you wouldn't go and see Mr Dobbs. Of course I wouldn't. He's dead. - Oh .. That's just like you. Every time you're told the truth you make a joke about it. Well it isn't funny to me! It isn't funny to be married to a failure! She sure looks pretty in that French lace. Eight and half yards at $27.98 a yard. I've only got one daughter. She's only marrying once .. I hope. You look pretty good yourself. - Yes. Not bad. Amazing, what you can rent these days. Judge, Miss Bailey is looking for you. - Oh, is she? Hector, you know my new son-in-law. - Sure. What are you two hiding here for? - What do you think? Oh Miss Bailey, here he is. You know, John. The time may come when you'll be hiding from Catherine. You would want me to .. hello Evelyn. I've been looking for you everywhere. Oh, have you? Come along dear, Mr Struthers wants to talk to you. Things went off nicely, don't you think? - Very nicely. Nice champagne, too. A good picker, my boy. - He certainly is. Tom. Evelyn and I have been talking. - Yes. You've heard about the Union Trust re-organization? Yes. It's a whale of a legal tangle. We've been looking for the right man for a couple of months now. - Yes? We need a fist-rate lawyer and the kind of integrity which will .. Strengthen the present board of directors. We think you are it. Thank you. The job pays twenty thousand a year. Sounds pretty good. - Of course, you get some stock too. Sounds very good. - Tom. Do you think you could .. run down to Washington for a few days next week? Thank you very much, John. That's very attractive offer. But I think you are talking to the wrong fellow. I happen to like being a judge. - Please, Tom. I don't like the notion of throwing away the satisfactions I get from this job. For the doubtful advantages of a job for which I think I'm really not suited. I don't think I really need a chauffeur. Or a limousine. [ Hic! ] I beg your pardon. Well. He seems to know his own mind, doesn't he. Tom? Oh no .. it's just the champagne. When the custody of a child is contested. It is the duty of the court to disregard the feelings of the guardian or parent. And to consider solely the best interests of the child. This court therefore awards the custody of the minor "Charles Winthrop" .. To his Grandfather. Cabot Royce Winthrop. Court is adjourned. Everyone rise. You decided it the only way you could, under the law. It will stand up in any court. Oh sir, Struthers called. - Oh. And .. your wife called. Three times. - Yes. Yes, I know. Is it the ticket you're looking for? - Thank you. So, you are going to take the job. I didn't say I'd take the job. I merely promised Mrs Bailey that I'd take a trip to Washington. And look things over. Down two. 143 and a half. If you don't mind, gentlemen. There you are, sir. What about Amos Steel? - Up three quarters. Maybe you would like the dinner? Excellent roast beef tonight. No. Just one poached egg. Those Southern bonds have me worried. - I've got options on them. You're pretty shrewd. You're never caught. What about Union Press? - Still down. Sound as a bell. Struthers knows his onions. - That's very interesting. The Struthers' son wed the daughter of the judge who tried the Winthrop case. Why not? Winthrop was pretty heavily involved in Union Trust himself. These fellows are just like that. Now I see. - It's obvious. For you, the poached egg, sir? - Yes .. never mind. Cancel it. Yes? - Doctor Boyd? What's the matter? Didn't you find Doctor Murdoch in? As a matter of fact .. - That's alright. Nobody comes to me unless Murdoch is out .. come on in. That hurt? - No. Here? - No. Here? - No. How about this? - Yes, that hurts. Well, what do you expect when someone jabs you in the liver? Come on, sit down over here. Well, Doc. Do you think I'll live? - Is it worth the trouble? Breathe. How often does your wife go to a massage parlour? About once a week. How did you know I was married? How long is it since you had a massage? Not since I went to school. Breathe again. Been working hard to keep the family in the style that they're accustomed to? I've just one daughter. One can give you as many ulcers as a dozen. Is that what it is? How long have you been married? - Nineteen years. Well .. you're in remarkably good shape. Considering. Is it an ulcer? Button up your shirt. You've either been doing something you don't like. Or you're about to do something you don't like. Both are fatal. What is this strange malady? Inflammation of the family. You won't find it in any medical books. But it's actually killing more men, than all the germs in China. Of course, you can always try a bland diet. Lots of sleep .. no alcohol. Have a drink? Take it .. it won't bite you. Of course, there is a cure .. but you respectable fellows are all alike. You wouldn't have the guts to try it. - Well, what is it? My prosperous colleagues would call it "A Complete Change". But I've no bedside manner. I call a spade a spade. Forget your wife. Forget your family. Forget your job .. and run! Run for your life. I guess I'd better try the diet. How much do I owe you, Doc? You don't owe me anything. I don't charge people I can't help. Would five dollars cover it? Thanks. It's a nice rod you have here. Shrunken bamboo, isn't it? - That's right. I didn't expect you'd know about things like that. I used to. I'm going up to the lake in the morning. The season has just opened. They say there is lots of trout this year. I've a nice little cabin. Nothing like fishing to take your mind off things. Goodbye, Doc .. I hope you catch a lot of fish. Here is your train, mister. Say, I thought you were going to Washington. I've changed my mind. Would you send this telegram for me? Sorry. Phil has gone for the night. Oh, I can send it in the morning. These have been the best three days I've spent in years. I don't think I ever saw a fish like that big one yesterday. Pull to your left a little. You know, you're a pretty good fisherman for a judge. You're a pretty Doctor for a fisherman. You're still wrong .. you can't argue against facts. Do you know that 76% of all the wealth of this country .. Is in the hands of women? Is that so? And why? Because men kill themselves making money. While their wives collect their life insurance. All you bachelors talk the same way. Trying to justify your failure to increase the country's population. What gave you the idea I failed? Or that I am a bachelor? What? - Yes, sir. I've been married 33 years. I have 7 children. And I'm twice a grandfather. You know, Doctor, you've really put me in the soup. I've no idea what to tell Mrs Bailey. Tell her nothing. Here's something for you to read on the train. It's been wonderful not seeing a newspaper for three days. What are you running home for then? Why don't you stay another week? What's the matter? - It says here .. I've disappeared. What? "Prominent Jurist Missing." "Judge Bailey Disappears." Well .. what do you know? I didn't send that telegram. I've got to telephone. - Wait a minute. You don't understand. This is terrific, judge. It's a miracle. Hello operator. Operator, I want Boston. Deacon 2097. This is the chance of a lifetime. Grab it. Hello .. operator, will you hurry it up please. I've got to catch a train. You won't have any responsibilities. You can do as you please. You'll be freed. Remember, no pains in the stomach. Don't be ridiculous. They must be out of their minds with worry. Yes? Busy? Busy .. I'd better send that wire. But my dear fellow. Suppose they're not worried? Why should they? Your daughter is marrying a rich man. Your wife will get the insurance. They don't need you. Hear that? It's my train. Well Doc, will you send this for me? I wouldn't. This will be an awful shock for them. You're a great help. Goodbye, Doc. Thanks for everything. And send that telegram, will you? You've certainly got an ego. You really think they're weeping their eyes out for you? The truth is they're probably relieved. You are certainly an optimist. All aboard! Goodbye my friend. Be careful how you walk in on them. Sucker. Hey Doc, send the .. don't. Whose bid is it? - Two spades. Pass. - Pass. Now whose bid is it? - Mine. And I bid three hearts. He always seemed such thoughtful man to me. He's very sweet as husband's go. Did this husband go? - He went. Evelyn, that is not a nice thing to say. We don't know what's happened. - Come now, let's not make a wake of it. I'm terribly grateful to you all for keeping me company. But after all, accidents do happen. If there had been an accident we'd have heard long ago. It mightn't be an accident. He might have planned it. Planned it? He never plans anything without consulting me. She means another woman, dear. - Tom? Oh don't be ridiculous. Whose bid is it? But what if he just got bored? You know, got fed up and just decided to vanish. Fed up? When he was leading exactly the kind of life he planned? And was about to be appointed Chief Counsel for the Union Trust. Oh no, dear .. he isn't the kind to simply just vanish. Now whose bid is it? - Mine. And I bid four hearts. Pass. - Pass. What do you say, Evelyn? Sorry, I can't seem to concentrate. - Poor darling. It is only natural. I think you've been very brave. And what makes me so furious, is it's all so unnecessary. I'm sure he's perfectly safe and sound. Probably ran into an old classmate on the train and is visiting him somewhere. And he's written me one of his long letters explaining everything. And usual has forgotten to mail it. Four of spades. [ Knocking sounds ] What was that? It must be the wind. Isn't it terrible weather we're having? - Simply awful. Even for Boston. And so Ulysses left his native Ithaca and went away. Days became weeks, and weeks became months. His wife Penelope sat at home and waited. Ulysses wandered from place to place and from city to city. One day, weary and thirsty. He climbed to the brow of a hill to survey the countryside. And there began one of his strangest adventures. You know, I had an adventure once. I got all dirty having it, and they told me not to have an adventure ever again. Did you ever have an adventure? - Uhuh. You're falling asleep. If you don't pay attention, how can I show you how well I read? I beg your pardon. It's the heat. Are you an orphan? Yes .. yes, I am. - So am I. What orphanage do you live in? Well, I live just wherever I happen to be. May I show this book to Peggy? - Who's Peggy? She's my best friend. She's the nicest person I ever met. - She must be wonderful. She is. Nan, where are you? - Coming. I have to go back to town now. Thank you very much for reading to me. - Bye. Bye. - Goodbye. Anybody home? Where is everybody? Hey .. is there anybody here? Hi. - Hi. Is Peggy around? - The young lady out back is asleep. I hope. - What are you doing here? I'm getting a bottle of beer and a doughnut. And a cash register? No. I put in fifty cents. - You were going to pay for the beer? Sure I was going to pay. And the doughnut too .. I did. I've got fifteen cents change coming to me. Put it back, Bud. - Huh? Put it back. So, you got the right to come in here and .. So, you want to start trouble, huh? Okay. Jack will attend to that. - Who is Jack? A friend. He wears a uniform and rides a motorcycle. Look. Don't call a Policeman. - What's a matter? Don't you like Cops? I was just getting change. I don't know how to convince you. Convince him. Oh! I .. beg your pardon. Well .. Hello beautiful. - What's going on here? I caught your cash register with this guy's hand in it. I was just getting some silver. - Okay Mike, take a look. There was six dollars and some change. Well, now you got exactly one buck and 56 cents. There must be a mistake. I put in 50 cents and took out 20. I mean about fifteen cents because I paid for the doughnut .. Hi everybody .. what's cooking? This goof here swiped five bucks out of the till. I didn't swipe anything. - I saw you. Okay. Come around here. What's your name? - Tom. Tom Brown. - Occupation? I sell books. - In hardcover? Okay, turn out your pockets. I assure you, Officer .. - Just a minute. I remember now. I used that five to pay for some ice cream that was delivered this morning. You sure? - Sure. I'm awfully sorry. If this keeps up, I guess I'd better get myself a bookkeeper. Okay Brown. You'd better watch your step when you are around here. Thanks Peggy. - Goodbye, Jack. Thank you very much. - That's alright. Okay deadbeat. On your way. Well, if you don't mind, I think I'll finish my beer .. I paid for it. Peggy, can I have the key to the pump? I want to fill up. You know where it hangs, you lug. That's my Peggy. Yell if you need me. You .. paid for this, too. Why did you do it? - What? Take the five bucks? You said yourself, there was .. - Of forget it, we've all been broke. What makes you think I'm broke? I've got a job. I know .. you sell books. He tells me about an old Greek who set wax in his ears .. And had adventures with a siren. So Nan told you? - Yes. How much is that book? Oh you don't want to buy that book for Nan. She's much too bright for it. She ought to read Homer the way he wrote it. Not in a botched-up digest. I guess you don't sell very many, do you? I get along. What did you do before you hit the road? Oh .. All kinds of things. I guess you don't like city jobs, do you. Well, do you think I could get one? Well there's a lot of people around here who could use some help. You think they'd take a chance hiring a fellow they think is a thief? I never said you were a thief. If you are, you're not a very good one. Well, here's your five. Okay. If that's the way you feel about it. I was only trying to help. My, but it's hot outside. Mike said he took thirty gallons. So long .. and say hello to Nan for me, will you? Who's that? Oh .. Just another tramp. Hey deadbeat .. want a ride? - Thanks. Thanks very much. - Come on. Hop in. Also, I found a couple of dozen kitchen towels at the sale. Well, you did pretty well for 10 bucks. - Oh, I took another 5 from the drawer. Oh .. you did? Yes. What's the matter with that? - You don't understand. This is wrong. Hey, mister .. mister! Mike! How about us going out Saturday night? Why, Mr Swenson, I didn't know you felt way about me. Look Peggy, you know you're my favourite girl on this run. There is nothing I wouldn't do for you. - In that case, bring the beer in. Oh. Alright .. where is it? - Outside the back door. Okay. You. I forgot my books. - Oh, I'm so glad you did. I wore out a new pair of soles getting here. You didn't steal that money. That's alright. You look dead tired. Can I fix you something to eat? Oh, thank you very much, but I've got to get back to Los Angeles tonight. I have a living to earn. You wouldn't consider taking a job around here? I could use a short-order cook. I really could. Well, I can't cook. Except boiled eggs. Goodbye. Are you sure you wouldn't like a cup of hot coffee? I just made it. Well, there is a fellow outside. I got a ride .. so .. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Peggy, the beer's in. - Coming. I forgot .. What do you think you are doing? - Hey, take it easy. Oh .. you poor man. What's so funny? Well, did you think he was trying to get fresh? Me? Why, she came jabbing at me like a kangaroo. I thought I saw a mouse. You caught him. Ham and eggs. - Coming up. So one of the professors slips him a shot of twenty-year old bourbon. And now he can whisper. He takes another shot, and now you can hear him across the river. So he finishes the flask and goes out to the crowd. Give me the ketchup. "Mr President" he says. "Mr Churchill .. welcome." "Welcome to Yale." I don't get it. - What's so funny about it? Oh. The fellow was making the speech at Harvard. What were you doing at Harvard? - I was .. Raking up the leaves in the yard. - Liar. Why don't you go on back to your till, and leave the artist to his work? You've been practicing. Hello beautiful. - Hi, Mike. What will you have? Just a cup of Java. Hi deadbeat. You still here? Why not? I like the food and I like the management. What are you doing Saturday night? - Sorry Mike, I've got a date with Joe. Who you got a date with next Saturday? - I got dance lessons. The Saturday after that? - One hamburger. With "cookie" here. Have you forgotten? You promised to take me out and teach me how to rumba. Oh yes, yes. - Now, don't forget a date. So .. you made yourself right at home didn't you, Mr Brown? Come on .. ham and rye up there. Hey. - I'm busy now. It's not that. It's about Nan. - Oh. I found a lawyer. He wrote up that adoption form for you. Oh thanks Mike, but you shouldn't have done that. I've sent it in already. Cookie made it out for me. - Oh .. I see. A pretty handy man to have around. He cooks, does legal papers, everything. It's no crime to have an education. - I wonder where he got it. What do you mean? You know what I mean. You'll wake up some morning with your throat slit from ear to ear. Have you talked to him? - Not yet. Tom. - Uhuh. You do an awful lot of work around here. You don't even take a day off. Why don't you let me pay you a regular salary. A decent one. You couldn't afford my regular salary. Besides, I've already saved 17 dollars. If I save any more, I'll worry about what to do with it. But it isn't fair Tom. And you really do need lots of things. Like what, for instance? Like a new suit, for instance. What for? I'm not going out anywhere. I've got everything I want. Good food, lovely view, nice people. Plenty of things to fix, and lots of time to fix them in. This is exactly what the doctor ordered. You didn't get very far, did you? Well, what can I do? You can't even talk to him. You watch me. I can. You are a smart Hombre. Can't you figure out what the poor girl is trying to do? Perhaps she wants to buy me a new suit? - Si .. but why? Because she's like that. She'd give you the shirt off her back if you let her. Thomas, you are dumb. It wouldn't embarrass you to go out with a fellow who had a patch in his pants? Well .. - You have a date, no? Did she mean that? Thomas .. you are not only dumb, you are blind. Gosh, it's nice to be away. You know, if you had a flower in your buttonhole .. You'd look just like an ambassador in a newsreel. There is a little box in the back there. - For me? Oh dear, look. They still have drops of water on them. Oh Tom, you shouldn't have. Bring us two dry Martinis while we are looking. Yes, Mr Brown. They probably serve them here with a solid gold toothpick. Now, what will we have? Oh I don't know .. you order. Very well. How about breast of guinea-hen souffl?? Souffl? ? la maison. And a bottle of Ch?teau Rose '37. Gee .. maybe Mike is right and you are a Duke in disguise. That's right. The fifth Lord Eggbeater. - Eggbeater? For Pete's sake, let's get out of here. - What's wrong? Did you see what they charge for a hamburger? If my figuring is right, I'll still have a few bucks left over. Oh Tom, you didn't have to bring me to a place like this to have a good time. Oh come on, come on. This is an important occasion. We're celebrating. What are we celebrating? My new suit. I've been waiting for it for five years. Look at that drape, look at those shoulders. Only a quarter of it is me. But oh boy .. what dash! - It sure makes a difference. It makes you look real dignified. Dignified? - Uhuh. More like a Doctor or Lawyer. Oh dear, there goes $57.50 out the window. Oh no, it's very becoming. Honestly. You don't really like it here, do you? No. Well, what are we waiting for? I met him at a dance on Telegraph Hill. That's in San Francisco. I was born there. Gosh .. the things a dame will put up with when she's in love. Of course I was only a kid. I was just 18 when we got married. Do you think I might do better with a heavier ball? I don't know what you're worried about. You're ahead of me. That gave you 76. Well, that's not enough. I want to beat the pants off you. He drank of course. First he'd come home tight and weep on my shoulders. And he'd bring me candy the next day. Later on, he just came home tight. Too good. Well, here goes. Hey, that's a honey. How did that happen? - You sure you've never bowled before? How long did it last? - Six months was all I could take. Then I got a job as a waitress. That's how I met Chita. There aren't many like her, Tom. The way she sewed and knitted for the baby. She even bought a crib and painted it all pink and white. Is Nan ..? Nan isn't your child, is she? - No. But she's the same age my baby would have been. Oh, I'm sorry. Darling. I started off on the wrong foot and got stuck in the middle. Oh, you poor think. Are you hurt? - No. It didn't hurt at all, but .. What's wrong, darling? Let's get out of here. Tired? - No. Are you? - No. You know, this was the nicest date I ever went on. It was the nicest date I ever went on, too. Funny. We went out to dance and we never did. - That's right. Kind of a shame after all the work I put in with Chita on my Rumba. Did you? Hello. - Well? Hello. - What happened? Oh, we went bowling. - Until five in the morning? He's really awful sweet. - Did he say something? Do you know what his real name is? - I know one thing. It is not "Brown". He said it was "Lord Eggbeater". - He did tease? Bowling does some very funny things to Lord Eggbeater. What do you mean? - Take a look. Do you think he is making up his mind about something big? Something big? But his mind is made up, only he don't know it yet. Now he knows. - Knows what? That he loves you. - You think so? Listen, Peggy. When I talk about things like this, I do not think .. I know. And when he asks you to marry him, do not be a big fool. Say "Yes". Ah, don't be silly. - Don't you be silly. Here he comes. I must get something on. - And remember to say "Yes". Peggy, can I talk to you for a minute? - Just a moment, Tom. Peggy. - Good morning, Tom. Good morning. - How did you sleep? Peggy .. how long would it take you to get a new short-order cook? Why, Tom? - It's the only sensible thing to do. You see Peggy, I'm a .. I have a .. Is it because you are married? It's all my fault. I should have known this would happen. If I'd had any sense at all I'd have left here a long time ago. My .. you're an awful worrier aren't you? I'm not looking for a husband, Tom. If I ever think of marrying again you can be sure it won't be just because .. I held hands with a man in the moonlight. Peggy, I have no right to involve you emotionally. Maybe I wouldn't mind being involved. A little. Peggy, this is absurd. You don't know anything about me. This is far more complicated than I can tell you. You see .. You see, I've sort of .. I sort of .. disappeared. What did I ask you? Tom. Tom. I don't want to know who you are, or what your trouble is. You can go if you like. Or you can stay if you like. You don't owe me any explanation. Mike. - Is he crazy? Mike, have you gone daffy or something? What's the idea of driving in like that? You are right. I am drunk. Ever since I was a boy that high. I never was any drunker. How could I do a thing like this? To my best friends. Two of the sweetest people I know. - Well, what did you do? I was jealous. That's why. As soon as I told them I knew I shouldn't have. Told who? - The Sheriff. That's why I got drunk. What did you say? They're looking for you. I said you're the guy. Go ahead now, beat it. You still got a chance .. go ahead. Take my truck. I don't care. Hurry up. I'll get your things. - Peggy .. Peggy, wait. I'm not going to run away. - But Tom .. As a matter of fact I'm sort of glad this happened. Or else I would be so scared to lose you I wouldn't have the courage to leave. You see, Peggy .. I've fallen in love with you as if I were twenty. Oh, Tom. But you're crazy. You've got to go. Peggy, you've got the wrong idea entirely. The only thing I escaped from was the wife on Beacon Hill. Oh, gee Tom. I hope you know what you are doing, because I certainly don't. I never thought I'd look at another guy again. Then you came along and I .. Peggy, I'll be back. It shouldn't take too long to straighten things out. Well, if it was so easy, why did you bother to run away in the first place? Gosh, I hate Cops. I'm scared, Tom. This is silly, but I know .. I know if you go away, you'll never come back. The Sheriff .. I gave him a bottle of beer. You must get out through the back roads. No wonder it is hard to catch thieves. Hello Sheriff. I'm sorry to have caused you all this trouble. A fine time to be sorry. Do you go under the name of "Brown"? - That's right. It took you fellows quite a while to catch up with me, didn't it? I guess you know then why I am here? - I'm afraid so. You mean to tell me you did it deliberately? Well .. It was rather a combination of circumstances. Well, for crying out loud, why don't you send them back? Send what back? - The books. What books? "The Great Stories Of All Time" in twelve volumes? That's right. I'm terribly sorry, Sheriff. I'll send them back this afternoon. Well, see that you don't forget again. Thanks for the beer. Stop laughing you idiot. You almost gave me heart failure. Didn't you .. didn't you catch him? - Nope. He got away. Thank goodness. I got here in time. What are you laughing at? - Oh, I guess I'm an idiot too. I guess we both are. But Peggy .. sooner or later .. Later. Hi. Hi beautiful. - Hi handsome. Sit down for a minute. How long did I sleep? - Oh, a couple of hours, I guess. That's California for you. No time here .. no seasons. Back home, we'd call it "Indian Summer". Here it's always .. Always "afternoon". What's that you have in your hair? A lotus blossom? Oh .. it's just something that grows around here. "There is sweet music here that softer falls .." "That softer falls than petals from blown roses on the grass." What's that? Tennyson: "The Lotus Eaters". Pretty. It's all about that old Greek who set wax in his ears. Remember that? Yes, I remember. How long have you been here, Tom? All my life. This is the nicest fool's paradise there ever was. Do you think we're couple of fools? Fools? Why not? Why didn't you wake me? You got it all fixed up by yourself. Looks nice, doesn't it? - Wonderful. Nan's a mighty lucky girl. You going to put a tie on? For Nan's birthday? Certainly. Besides, she told me to. She also told you to keep your hands out of her jelly-beans. She said I could have one a day. She says you've been cheating. She counted them. You'd better look after your guests. - You'd better get your tie on. Hello Shirley. - Hello Peggy. I've got my brother. His name is Dick. Is it alright? He's brought a present, too. Certainly, there is going to be lots of little boys here. Have you got a cake? - I think so. May I have the present? Where is Nan? Coming. She ought to be here any minute. Hey gang, look out. Is Nan here yet? - No, not yet. - Good. Can we play on the Jukebox? - It's up there on the porch. That's super. There's five nickels on top, too. Do you have to wear a bow tie? - Yeah, the little brat told me to. I had an awful time trying to find the right present for her. What did you get? A truck with an automatic dump. - She'll love that. Peggy, could we see the room now? - Sure. But don't say anything to Nan. Oh no. - No, of course not. Hello .. hello everybody. - Good morning. Oh Tom, will you take the ice-cream out of the freezer? And let it soften up a bit for the kids. Come on. [ Crying sounds ] Chita? What's wrong? What happened to Nan? Thomas .. will you tell Peggy? They won't let Nan come here anymore. Oh, look at the cute little hangers. And a shoe-rack and everything. Nan will be tickled when she see it. Here comes Chita now. Come on, I don't want Nan to find us here. It's such a lovely room, Mr Brown. What's taking Nan so long? You and Mrs Forbes get the kids to sit down. I'll get the cake and get started. Just a minute, Peggy. - Tom, Did you take out the ice-cream? Peggy .. Nan is not coming. Not ..? Why? It's from the County Court. They've refused. They don't say why, or anything. Gee, ain't that something? I used to drive a real one once. Of course it didn't work as good as this. But it carried a bigger load. Shall I go with her? - No, I wouldn't. Hey, what's going on here? What's the matter with Peggy? They refused her application. You mean she can't have Nan? - Right. Well, here's the cake, kids. I made the frosting an inch thick. I'm sorry Nan couldn't come to her party. Who wants to blow the candles out for her? Me .. me! Aunt Peggy, let me. I can blow the hardest. I'm the biggest. You people are all the same. You think a judge sleeps through a case. Then flips a coin. Heads you win, tails you lose. I know, I know. How could you know? You don't know anything about it. The child is being taken care of in a very fine institution. She gets a real healthy diet, a good education, and a bit of discipline. And you want to put her in a hash-joint on a main highway that's open all night? To be brought up by a young woman who isn't even married. But, Your Honor, that isn't .. It's easy enough for you laymen, but a judge has to look at both sides. I know, I know. Don't keep saying you know. You don't .. you can't know. You have to be a judge to know. "Uneasy lies the head that sits on the bench". You know who said that? That was said by one of the greatest judges we ever had. His name was .. Oliver Wendell Holmes. Harvard class reunion. 1873. How did you know that? Are you a lawyer? No, I'm just a friend of the petitioner. What law school did you go to? I didn't say I went to any law school. What did you say your name was? Tom. I work at the caf?. Oh .. you're the cook. Of course, you living on the premises didn't help any, you know. Look, Your Honor. - Not that it made any difference. Listen, Brown. Strictly off the record. Why did you quit law? Well, I .. - Women? No. - Gambling? No. Nothing like that. Of course It's not my business. But I know a horse-doctor who has a sure cure for the drink habit. He doesn't do it with any psychology or snake-oil. He does it with vitamins. Thank you very much, Judge Davis. I'm afraid I'm too far gone for vitamins. Oh, Tom. Where have you been? You had me worried, it took you took so long. To see the judge. - Oh .. Do you think there is a chance? What did he say? He told me to lay off the bottle. Peggy! - Coming. Peggy .. I've got to go back to Boston. Oh, Tom. It's about time you got here. Burnt steaks while you were out. It's the only thing that can possibly help. It's no use. That old judge will never change his mind. Why not? Bring me a plate will you, Peggy? I made exactly the same mistake once. Then I changed my mind. What are you talking about? I had a case just like that. I took a kid from his mother, as she used too much make-up. Because his Grandfather could send him to Harvard. A judge? I don't know why I didn't tell you before. What's the matter with you today? The boys are in a hurry. Tom .. there was a fellow here just two days ago. He offered to give me a good price for the place. Why don't we sell up and go away? Anywhere. Where no-one knows us, who we are, or what we are. Peggy, it's no use. You can't .. Well, okay. If that's the way you feel about it. You're a judge. You ought to know how to decide things. Peggy, please don't .. - Oh, never mind. Watch those steaks. I don't know about you people, but I am very tired and going to bed. Buenos noches. Wait for me. I'm going too. Peggy .. please. This will not be easier to decide in the morning. Or tomorrow night, or ever. You're still going back? - Yes. Well then. It's decided and I had nothing to do with it. What can I say, Tom? I just don't understand. I can't have Nan, and now you. If I loved someone, I wouldn't run off and leave them. Peggy, I wish I could tell you .. How much more wonderful you are to me than I could ever be to you. Don't you see it's because of that, that things have to be right. Well, I just don't get it. Maybe I've been on a bench too long. There are certain rules, Peggy. And when you break them .. You are in trouble. I've got to go and clear up that whole mess in Boston. But .. then I'll be back and .. We'll be married. You'll have Nan and .. If you come back. I still have to go, Peggy. I've been running away too long. [ Door knocks ] It's too late. The place is closed. Nan! - I ran away. Nan. - Peggy. I hid behind the bush and they called and called. I got a little scared when it got dark, but I got a ride. Can I have some ice-cream? I'm hungry. - Oh yes. Tom, will you ..? They weren't mean to you, were they? - Oh no. I liked Miss Hepburn. Well then, why did you run away? I guess I liked you better. - Oh, darling .. darling. Here you are. Well .. now. They got mad at me because I climbed up a peach tree and broke a branch. You're not supposed to swipe the peaches, but all the big girls do. I guess you are going to go send me back? Oh no, darling. Not until morning. You see, Nan. You have to stick by the rules even if they do seem silly. If big girls didn't steal peaches then there would be some left for you. I guess no matter how much you want it .. You can't have what you want by breaking the rules. Running away. You'll be a big girl soon and you can come and be with me as long as you want. But Peggy, you might even go and adopt some boy. Oh, no I won't darling. I'll wait for you .. even if it takes ten years. Hello, Martha. - Hello. Oh. You're back. - What's going on around here? Oh, you mean the dentist? We had to let the downstairs. No, no. Who is this? - Tommy. Tommy who? - Your grandson. Here. You can hold him if you want. When did this happen? - In September. Mrs Bailey took him them in when his old man kicked them out. Take care of my grandson? - He's more. I don't think I'd better hold him. I've got a cold coming on. Why did he kick them out? His old man wanted him to be a banker, and he just wanted to paint. Martha. - Yes, ma'am? Has the diaper man been here yet? Yes, ma'am, and I told him what you told me to tell him. He said he could only visit on Tuesdays. Tom. - Hello Evelyn. Yes, he's back. Well .. I guess I'd better make a cup of tea. I'm sorry. I'm just .. - Didn't you get my wire? No. Did you send one? Oh dear .. I did it again. After that, I sold books. You're looking very well in spite of yourself. It's nothing. It's just that I'm not used to this Boston weather anymore. What are your plans, Tom? Are you going to remain here now? No, Evelyn. I'm going back to California. Funny. I never thought of myself as a divorced woman. What do I do now? Go to Reno? Evelyn, I .. - Yes? I don't know what to say. I didn't expect to .. You are not going back right away are you? No. I have a lot of things to attend to. I want to see Catherine and John and .. Spend a little time with .. You know, I can't get used to the idea of being a Grandfather. You will. Well .. I guess I'd better be going. I'll contact you in the morning. I think I'll stay in that small hotel down in .. Charles Street. You can't go to a hotel with a cold like that. Well, I'll be alright. - You're running a temperature. Oh .. I can't stay here. - Why not? Well people will talk. They stopped talking about me a long time ago .. not that it matters. They wouldn't .. even know you were back anyway. Evelyn .. what's happened to you? Nothing. I suppose .. I just had time to think about things. Maybe .. it's being at home more. With the children and little Thomas. Well, we'll have to think up some kind of a story for the rest of the family. What's wrong with "amnesia"? You almost had me believing it. Although I knew it wasn't. You knew? - Not right away. When I found your galoshes gone, I began to ask myself "why"? Of course I knew why the galoshes were gone. It was raining .. but you know what I mean. Are you saying you knew all along, and you didn't tell anybody? Not a soul. I guess I have changed, haven't I. Well, I was in Chicago working as an elevator boy. With a uniform? - Sure. Well, I got kind of tired going up and down all the time. So I asked a fellow at the bus station how far I could get on $23.60. And he gave me a ticket to Yellow Creek. That's where I got put in jail. Jail too .. but then I suppose that was to be expected. What did they get you for? - Just a minute, Judge. It may be just as well if we are left in ignorance of some of your "adventures". This was no adventure. This was just a lack of visible means of support. Is that all? I'd hoped they'd at least caught you stealing a horse or something. Well, I must be getting back to work. - Wait a minute, Hector. Sit down. You haven't told me how things are getting on down at the office. Oh, much the same I guess. We have a new janitor now. We gave old Jeffreys a new set of teeth when he retired. I suppose they threw out all my decisions the minute I left town? Oh no, no. We only had two appeals. You were upheld in one, and the other is pending. Which is that? - That Winthrop case. Remember? Yup. Nothing to worry about. The decision won't be announced until Thursday. I know they'll let it stand. Thursday. Just three days. Tuesday, Wednesday .. that's right. Evelyn, get my clothes. - Where do you think you're going? To the courthouse. I want to get some papers. Stay where you are. John can get them. - Yeah, sure. What do you want? All the things you have on the Winthrop case. Evelyn, where'd are my files? - Up in the attic. Get them down will you. - What you want them for? I can't do it without the records. Are you going to try and appeal your own decision? Sure. Catherine, get me a pad .. a lot of pencils. Sharp. You, you can't be serious. What's wrong, Hector? - Well .. Your Honor, I've always had the greatest respect and affection for you. Maybe the happiest years of my life were spent in association with you but .. Well, I must tell you .. I think you have lost your mind. Oh, not my mind, Hector. Just the box I used to keep it in. Have you found anything yet? - No. It's getting to be silly. Like looking for a needle in a haystack. What makes it really tough is that we know there is no needle. I can't even find a haystack. - Well, there must be something. All I need is one little precedent, a paragraph, a comment. Anything. Anything to hang it on. - The car is ready. Well, if I'm going, I'd better put a tie on. Poor Tom. It isn't easy. - No, it isn't. It is none of my business, Miss Bailey. I wish you could persuade him to drop this whole idea. It just can't be done. He'll only make himself ridiculous. So far, nobody knows he's back and you can get a divorce quietly, but .. If he goes through with this .. You may still get a divorce. But it won't be quiet. I'm afraid this is one time .. I'm not going to say anything. "So you see things have worked out much better than I expected." "I would have returned by now if it were not for my appeal of the Winthrop case." He should keep his nose out of the courthouse. Now it will be weeks before he gets back. He must have liked being a judge. Did you know judges wear robes in Boston? Ha! I'd kind of like to see him that way once. You know what is behind this? The wife. First the cold, then this. I think he's getting all tangled up. - Oh, shut up. Why don't you do something? - What can I do? You won't spend five bucks on a telephone call? Evelyn, the telephone. Evelyn. Yes? Oh, put her on! Hello darling, this is wonderful. Oh, probably in a few days now. Yes, I just found out I can't do anything about it. Yes, I am a little disappointed. I guess I'm not as clever as I thought I was. I wouldn't feel so bad about that. I'm sure you've done everything you could. It sounds a pity that you were so prejudiced then. But you couldn't help that, either. What did you say? No, before .. prejudiced? Well Tom, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. Oh darling, you should have been a lawyer. Tom .. when are you coming back? Tom .. He hung up. Tom, where are you going? I'm going to the courthouse. I've found my paragraph. Hi, Jack. - How are you, Judge? Carl, get me the Press Room. Yeah? What? Are you sure it was Bailey? Bailey is back! Floor eleven, please. Finds no grounds for any change in the original decision .. As rendered by Judge Thomas Bailey. Court adjourned. Mister Chief Justice. - Order in the Court! One moment, please. Mr Chief Justice, may I have the privilege of addressing the court? Bailey .. is it really you? Where did you come from? - California. What happened to you? - Are you alright? Thank you. I've never felt better in my life. Well, what's on your mind? I would like to call the attention of the High Court. To a miscarriage of justice which arose in the case of Winthrop versus Winthrop. Well, we've already ruled on that. You are too late. - By ten seconds, Your Honor. This is a rather peculiar situation. And a highly unorthodox one. And maybe very interesting. Go ahead, Bailey. Thank you, Your Honor. Mr Chief Justice. I ask the court to order a new trial in to the case of Winthrop versus Winthrop. On the grounds that I, Thomas Bailey .. Was not a fit and proper judge to hear the case. Really? Why not? - Because of prejudice. Why didn't you disqualify yourself at the time? I didn't know it then, Your Honor. - What did you do? Institute a search in the files of your conscience? Is that now considered unethical? - This is ridiculous. If you're prejudiced and we upheld your decision then we are also prejudiced. If you say so Your Honor, it must be so. Then nobody is fit to be a judge. - Gentlemen, gentlemen. We are .. we are not in session. Remember. - But .. The more choleric we become the more we prove Judge Bailey's point. Look .. look! Just get a look at this. How do you do? Have you heard the news? It took a long time, but he finally did it. It's in all the papers. Your cook has turned out to be about the most famous judge in the United States. "Vanishing Judge makes legal history." "Judge reverses Massachusetts Supreme Court." Listen to this. "The Supreme Court accepted his plea." "And granted full custody of the child to the mother, Mrs Joan Winthrop." What do you know about that? - Oh, I'm so glad. Do you realize what he's done? This doesn't happen once in a hundred years. Can you beat that? And I always thought he picked up his law behind the barn. Oh well. I guess we all make mistakes. Yeah. Sometimes, it's awfully hard to know what's the right thing to do. Peggy! Nan! I forgot to tell you. In light of what's happened, I've sort of reconsidered. Nan. He says I can stay now for good. - Oh, darling. And I told him to lay off the bottle. It's a curious thing. The last time there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court .. I wasn't even going to name you. - I didn't know that. No. I .. I thought you were just a little bit too much .. Of a stuffed-shirt. - You were right. And now that you've gotten the moss out of your system, you don't want it. I would have given my right arm for the job then. Ah, it's a pity. I'm the only young man left on that bench, and I'm 84. You know, Bailey. I quit the law once. And joined a circus in France. - You did? Did you ever hear of Yvonne Sadeaux? No. Oh no, of course you couldn't. She was the greatest bare-back rider of her day. She was very beautiful. And I was twenty-three. They say it hits you harder when you're my age. Yes. Maybe the reason it hits so hard is because you realize it's too late. It might be. I've lived half my life. I never once suspected that what I found out there was even possible. When you find it. You don't give it up. I've got to run along. Goodbye, Bailey. - Goodbye, sir. Good luck. Hello, Annie. Oh, hello Judge. It's mighty nice to see you again. Are you going to be back with us for a while, now? No, I don't think so. Is there anybody in back there? - No, they've all gone. Hello, Hector. Hello. The old place hasn't changed very much. Why should it? I see you had all these re-bound. - Yes. Nice leather. No doubt about it. Old Simpson is the best bookbinder in town. Got them all up to date? I thought you weren't interested in those things anymore? That's right, I'm not .. what have you got to say about it? Go on, tell me it's none of my business. But I always understood that being an adult meant accepting responsibility. It is incomprehensible to me that a man of your training and background. Can behave like a pimply adolescent, running off to some South-Sea island. You've never been to a South-Sea island, Hector. Maybe you've never wanted to. A lot of people don't. Thank you .. I think this is all. Well, thank you very much, Williams. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Judge. Mrs Bailey. - Goodbye. You don't mind letting yourself out? - Not at all. I know the way. Goodbye. Well, that's that I suppose. Yes. Everything seems pretty simple, now. Maybe that is where Mrs Bailey made her mistake .. as they say on the radio. I don't think it's a mistake. As a matter of fact, we're better friends now. Than we have been for a long time. You haven't got much time. Maybe you'd better take a taxi. Well, Evelyn. Be sure to take a muffler and don't forget your galoshes. Good heavens, I'm not falling apart. - I didn't mean that, only .. Only you've just gotten over a bad cold. I'm awfully sorry. This must be my bad day. I don't know why I snap at you when you show more understanding than the others. That's alright, Tom. And Tom. I'd like you to know. If ever you're in Boston .. You're always welcome here. Thanks, Evelyn. Goodbye, Tom .. you'll miss your train. Goodbye. Hey mister. Would you watch this for me for a minute, please? All aboard! - Oh, Johnny! Thank you very much. He was an awfully nice old man, wasn't he. California for you. There is no time here. No seasons. Back home we'd call it "Indian Summer". Here, it is always Summer. Always afternoon. Go on, tell me it's none of my business. But I always understood that being an adult meant accepting responsibility. It is incomprehensible to me that a man of your training and background. Can behave like a pimply adolescent, running off to some South-Sea island. Tom. Peggy. Tom .. oh darling I was so scared I'd miss you. Peggy, where'd you come from? - I only got here an hour ago. There was a storm and the plane downed. I phoned the house, but you'd gone. Oh Peggy, Peggy. - Oh, Tom. Tom .. I wrote you fifty letters. I tore them all up. I knew they wouldn't stop you. Stop me? - Uhuh. All the way here, I sat up trying to think of what to say and couldn't. But I do know Tom. This is your place. This is your home, your work, your people, your life. - Peggy, I .. These are the things that make you what you are. You mustn't leave .. you can't. Alright, darling .. I'm not leaving. You're not? I was on my way home when .. you found me. Well. I guess I made quite a fool of myself flying out here like this. Oh no. It's the sweetest thing anyone ever did. That's alright. It's often the person who, more than anyone else, you want to save from hurt. That you hurt the most. Hector was right. I should act my age and stop chasing rainbows. Tom .. Why, you are the biggest darn fool I ever saw. Have you gone crazy? Too old for what? Why, you are too young to spend the rest of your life in a hammock. You know what the papers say? They say you'll be the youngest judge they ever had on the Supreme Court. Yes. I suppose that's true. It doesn't mean much, really. Most of the others are over a hundred. You know, we get a lot of tourist trade now. It's just like George Washington slept here. And Nan shows them the yard, and shutters you painted. Is everything alright about Nan? Oh yes. It's all fixed. But we're very happy, Tom. After all, that's what I wanted most. Thanks for that, too. Oh Peggy. Don't. If I'm any good in this new job. It's because I learned a great deal more in California than how to flip pancakes. All aboard! Tom you have a ticket for this train, haven't you? Yes. - Well, let's not waste it. It makes it sort of a short visit, doesn't it. Maybe it's just as well. Nan will eat nothing but ice-cream until I get back. She liked her room? - Oh, she loves it. How is Chita? - She's fine. She said to tell you she's taken off weight since you left. Good. - I fixed the heater. How's the hydrangeas? - 0h wonderful. That high. All aboard! Tom. All the customers still say you were the best cook on Highway 101. -(t-g)-
