You tell her Vicki Green said so. Alright? - Think so. - Serves you right for bunking off. Look, got to work later. Fancy babysitting for us?

That happens again they'll have me to deal with. - Mum? - What? - Did Lenny say anything to you? - Yeah. - Mum. - I'm not going there. - But Mum we haven't been for a year. - The answer's no. - Lenny will buy the tickets. - Look you stay away from him. - Dad. - No thank-you, we're watching our weight. - There's more meat on a butcher's pencil. - Oh well, that's as maybe. But as you well know Melody, cholesterol is a silent killer. I'm on a low fat diet and Denis is keeping me company. Aren't you Denis? - Do you like it? - Thank you Nanna that's great. - I'm so glad. - 'Ere. 'Course I didn't make mine. I'm sorry about this morning. - It's alright. Unreal. Wicked! - Proper Hammer's kit! - Thanks mum you're the best. Oh darling. I hope it's what you wanted. Does it fit? - Yeah. - Oh fantastic. - Oh wicked. Mum. I'll be back about midnight depending on business. Mel alright about it? - Oh yeah. - Vicki. - Em? - Do you know what a junkie is? - Depends who's asking. - I am. A junkie's a waste of space. They lie and cheat and steal to get the money to pay for it. They shit on everyone they love and lose everything they care about. Then one day they either stop taking it or they die. - That's alright then. - It is? That kid who beat me up said mum was a junkie, but she ain't none of those things is she? Here's a tenner. Get a pizza if you want. Not pepperoni it gives Rose the shits. "Raviola takes the penalty for Barcelona." - He moved for it the wrong way. Hopeless. - And it's in. "Barcelona takes the lead, and the home crowd go wild." Abu. Is Vicki alright? She's overdone it a bit that's all. Where's Rose? - Upstairs sleeping. Mum. Mum. Mum shall I call the police get the ambulance? - No. Don't. - I'll get Nanna she'll know what to do. - It's alright. Shall I get your medicine Mum? What happened Mum? It was a burglar. I surprised him and he landed me one. Can you ring Mrs Rawlings, tell her I'm poorly? I already have done. Says get well soon. You're the best. - Yeah, see you later love. - Yeah what d'ya like? - The little lad was here first. - I'd like you to give Mum her job back. I rang earlier and you told me to tell her not to bother to come in any more. Yeah you'd best come outside. Mum isn't exactly poorly like I said. She got beat up by a burglar. - And he beat you up too? - No that was someone else. I've given your mum loads of chances. She chucks them back in my face. She's unreliable. You're stuck with your mum. I'm not. She said you had a face like a cats arse. Listen, I'm sorry about your mum love. Because I know it's been hard for her since ya dad passed on. You know, you're mum needs to stop using. Our Anna did it. God knows if she can do it anyone can. Ain't the answer to anything. - What ain't? Heroin. Heroin sweetheart. Don't matter what they call it, they're always banging it into their veins. There are people who can help junkies like your mum. She ain't a junkie. You got it wrong. And I come back up and she's passed out. Where you gonna take her? I'll come back later alright. Mum. Vicki's over done it again. They're just taking her home. Rose is stopping with us tonight. You alright Rose? - I'm hungry. - Vicki will give us something to eat. Come on, come in then. - Lucy. Hello Lucy. Vicki. Vicki. Vicki. - Lucy's a nice name isn't it? - Let's go! Let's go. - Stop shouting. - Put the puppy down! - Don't pull me. - Hurry up! - Going as fast as I can. Quick! Mum. Mum. Mum. Vicki's dead Mum. - Are they attached to the fuckin' umbilical or what? - Mum. Mum. - Paul, go grab your football. Let's have a bit of a kick about. Look. Truth is accidents happen with gear. - Don't want Mum to have an accident. - Hey look there's no chance of that son. And she's not a basket case like Vicki. Eh Abu? It's time for our next appointment. Look I'll look after her alright? Oi. Come here. Take it. You'll need the extra now you've got Rose to worry about. Mum? Mum? - What's up with you? - I'm a doctor. - Oh bully for you. Could I have a look at your little girl? Hello. Just going to look at your chin. How long's she had this infection? - Don't ask me. - Well you're her mother aren't you? - No. She needs immediate medical attention. She would've got it if her mother hadn't been so shit scared of you lot. She deliberately avoided getting her little girl seen to? Vicki tried her best but her best weren't good enough. You try being good enough on six bags of rock a day. I was going to dump her up social Services but I tell you what, if you're so bloody concerned. You take her. - Mum you gotta take her. - Now hold on. - Come on. Get off the bus. - Mum you can't. Wait! What do you think you're doing? You can't just dump this child on me. Come on. - Don't give her pepperoni it gives her the shits. - Leave it, you. - Paul. - I don't believe you did that. You don't care about anything anymore. Do ya? You lied to me mum. It's not medicine, it's heroin. You're the same as Vicki. You're using and you're gonna die. - I'm not gonna die. - Get off me! - I'm not gonna die. - You are Mum. Everyone on heroin does. Vicki said so. One day you either stop taking it or else you die. That's what she said. The next day she was dead. - Stop it Paul. Get off. When you die me and Lee we'll have no Dad and no Mum. Social services will have to find us some new ones. - Okay. - So we might as well sort it out now. - Stop it. That's enough! That's enough, alright? - You alright Mel? - Louise? Do you know her? - No. Not much. - Stay away from her she's trouble. - You say everyone's trouble. - Social Services took her baby away. - She's not old enough to have a baby. Exactly. I'm going to give it up. Stop using. - Good. - It's not going to be easy coming off it. - Can't be harder than being on it. Mind the cars Lee. Just read about that friend of yours Vicki. Vicki Green. Eh, Paul, Lee go in with your Granddad alright? Go on. I can't do it all on my own. You don't know about the way I'm living. All I'm asking you for is a little bit of help. A little bit of time, that's all I need. If you'd take Lee off me for a couple of days Listen to me Mel, I am helping you. I want the boys here. Paul, Lee we're going home Come on. - I'm busy imprisoning Granddad. Paul's given him poison to find out his secret. I thought Lee was stopping here. - He was but he's not anymore alright. Come on get your coat. Shift! - If my John were here he'd sort you out. If my John were here he'd sort you out. Well he ain't here is he? Cos you killed him. With your chips with everything. Butter on everything. Sugar on everything. He had a bloody heart attack Joan. I don't think much of you Melody, and I never have. But you're their Mother. I don't want to go outside the family. Unless I have to. Now Paul, since Lee's stopping with your Granddad... and me why don't you stay here as well? - It's okay, thanks. - I'll make your favourite for tea. Shepherd's Pie and peas. - I'm going home with Mum. You be a good boy alright. I'll ring you later. See you then. Bye. Is this how your supposed to do it? If I had a couple of thousand I'd go to a fancy clinic, but I ain't. - Who's that? - That's you. Yeah, five minutes after you were born. Came out backwards you did. Doctor had to pull you out with forceps. Nanna knitted you a balaclava to hide the dent in your head. There it is. Face like a bashed tater. I didn't care. To me you were beautiful. I felt like I'd been given the best present ever. Your Dad felt the same. He cried. He pulled his shirt open, held you against him. Next Saturday, when you're better, can we go to the match like we used to? - I couldn't. - Oh, please. I know I'm a shit mother. I never say it. But I always think it. I love you. Listen to me. The truth is, I'm going to be sick as a dog for a week. Don't be scared if I go weird. It'll be the heroin talking, remember that. Paul I'll say anything, anything to get a fix. But you just do what we talked about, alright? If you don't Paul. God I've only got the strength to do this once. It's okay Mum we'll do it together. Don't let anyone in. Especially Lenny, promise me. - I promise. - Whatever happens, don't leave me alone. Yes. Paul. Paul. Paul, I'm okay now. It's all done. Paul I need to take a shower. You can open the door and let me out. - No Mum. - Cold out here. - It's cold in here. - Can I come in? - No. - Stop messing about. Open the door, I'm a policeman. - Oh, yeah? Okay? I'll walk away. Mum's poorly. I'm looking after her. Looking after Rose too? - Not anymore. - Rose's Mum's dead. Somebody killed her. Leonard Lodge. Lenny to you. Rose won't be the only kid to lose a mum because of Lodge's gear. My number's on the back. Hope your Ma gets better soon. Mel! Mel! Paul! Paul! I need to talk to you. I'm really bad throwing my guts up. I just need my medicine. - No, Mum. When I've had my medicine we can go to the ticket office. We can go to the match on Saturday. - No. Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! I can't do this, Paul. I'm suffocating in here. Open the door! I'm warning you. I'm dying in here. And you're just going to let me are you? Your own Mummy? You're going to come in here and find me dead on the bed. - No! - Is that what you want? - You can say what you like, I'm not listening. You said you'd be like this, and now you are. You ain't coming out. You're gonna stay in there until you're better. - I don't want to! I hate you! You useless little git! Wait until I get my hands on you! You are just like that useless father of yours! Going off and dying on me like that and leaving me with you two! That pissy brat of a brother of yours. And you! You useless excuse for a son! - Shut up, Mum! - Stinking, shitty little bastard! I wish I'd never had you! - You don't mean it! Paul? Paul! You alright, titch? How you doing? Are you hungry? Just shut up shop and I've got loads left. - I can't. I'm looking after Mum. - Go on, I can even do you some fried eggs if you fancy it. - Can't! I'm sure she won't miss you for half an hour. Easy! No, go away! It's alright, go on then. You ain't done this before, have you? - I'm only ten. - Well you sort of pinch it. Ow! Gawd, not that hard! - Sorry. They're right sensitive since I got up the duff. - What's 'the duff'? - I'm having a baby. - Another one? - Who told you? - Mum. She said they took it away. Yeah, well you can tell her I'm keeping this one. I'm five months gone already. - Who's your baby's Dad, then? - You can pretend it's yours if you want. That'll get your mate going. - Get my Mum going and all. - You can go now. - What? - Your Mum, ain't she ill? - Oh, shit! Oh shit! How did he get in? - What have you done? See you later, sweetheart. Sorry, Mum. - Get some shopping in. - Don't want your money. She wanted to stop doing gear. She was nearly there. - It's not that easy, Paul. - Yes, it is. Gear makes people's lives shit. - No, you've got it wrong, son. Their lives are shit already. Gear just helps them forget about it. - Open up! Police! - Mum! - What have you done? - Nothing. He's done nothing. You've done nothing. - Hey, hold her! - Leave her alone! - Nobody does any thing. And the gear just turns up by magic. Always the bloody same. Just by magic. Hey, presto! - You told me this was a child protection enquiry. - I'm trying to nail a dealer. Up! Come on! Listen, listen! Who sells Lodge this shit, eh? - How should I fuckin' know? - Liam, why are you doing this in front of the boy? The boy likely knows more about drugs than you do. - Get off me! - Time for you to take a wee trip down to the local detox clinic. Won't cost you a cent. Take her away. Paul! Paul, stay with me, stay with me! Give him to me. - Leave her alone! - Paul! - Mum! Listen son. If someone was doing this to my Mum, I would really, really hate them. That's enough! - Where are they taking her? - It's all right. - Tell me. It's alright, it'll be alright. I can turn the heating up. I'm here to help. Help you and your Mum. - She don't need your help. I help her. I look after Lee, do the shopping and the cooking and the washing. I could do with one of you at home. I'll ring you tomorrow. We'll have a better idea whether she'll be charged by then. But I expect she'll be out by the morning. - More's the pity. I'll be wanting custody now of course. - We'll talk about it tomorrow. - If you like. Mum. Paul. Mum, you've got to come to Nanna's with me and Lee. Lenny! Lenny. - Just a caution? - Yeah, wanted to know about you though. On and on he went. - Yeah? - Ah, don't be stupid. Just give us a fix will you? - It's alright, darling. I've got one ready Picking up your girlfriend, Lodge? Detective Inspector French. Got anything I can do for you? Oh, you want to search my car do you? Go ahead. Be my guest. What you waiting for? You know what I'm waiting for. Not bad looking, are you? Big demand for pretty boys in prison. Pretty boy. - Come on. Paul, get in the car. - No, Mum. - Get in the car. - No, I'm not coming! He's gonna give you something, he'll stick it in you again. - What the fuck! - Jesus! - Paul! Little bastard! Don't you Fuck! Lenny, don't, don't - Mum, Mum! - Come 'ere and get in the fuckin' car! - Len, we're right outside the old bill. - Get in there! Get in! - Help me! - What is it with you, eh? Ain't I tried my best and you just chuck it in my face. I'm just helping your Mum. Yeah? - Making her take gear ain't helping her. - Yeah, well I never made her. Why don't you do everyone a favour and just clear off for a while, yeah? When you come back let's pull together as a family. - You're not family you're not Dad! - Yeah, I was his best friend. - No you weren't. He told you never to come round Said you were scum, I heard him. Why don't you get out of my face, yeah? Beat it, kiddo. - What's the matter? - Nothing. It's a bit vommy I know, but I couldn't pick and choose the colours. I'm trying to make it all nice for the baby. I'm going to have to tell Lenny. He wants me to go on the game to replace that Vicky but I said no. I ain't that cheap. I've been cutting right down on gear, so I ain't worried. I only smoke it. I ain't like your Mum. She's a real junkie. I'm sorry I called your Mum a junkie. But she is. Well yeah. Yeah, she is. But at least you've got a Mum. Mine gave me away. Junkie Mum's better than no Mum. Are you saying that I hurt my boys, is that what you're saying? Because I've never laid a hand on them. I'm not suggesting you actually hit them, Mel, but you are harming them. What's happening, Mum? - Do you want me to explain it to Paul? - No. I'll talk to him. I'll wait outside. I'm asking Nanna to look after you and Lee for a little while. You're giving me away? I am not giving you away. I'm lending you. Look, Paul. You're a big ten. But you're still just ten. And some things you can't do at your age. When can we come home, me and Lee? Soon. Soon. Just as soon as I've stopped using. I'll come and see you every day. Can't do that. Helen doesn't think it'll be such a good idea. - She can't stop me. - No, Paul. I'm askin' you. It'll be easier that way. For me. And for you. And then in a few weeks everything will be just like it used to be. And you'll be better? I'll be better. Everything will be better. - Did he go home? - Who? Sanjit Choudhuri. Little San? Yeah. Yeah, he did. So when one kid goes home you take another one away? It's not like that, Paul. You tell Nanna Mum's only lending me. Sure. And you'll be Mum's friend? She ain't got no friends now Vicki's dead. I don't know about being her friend, but I'll help her. I'll be your friend if you like. - It's alright thanks, I've got loads of friends. Bet you have. Nineteen Eighty FA Cup Final. I took your father to that. And his best friend. - Lenny? - That's right, Lenny. Billy Bond signed this. - Why have you got Dad's things? - Your Mum give it me. - I thought she'd thrown everything away. Yeah, she wanted me to take care of them for her. I've forgotten what Dad looks like. I can't see his face. - Louise! - You alright? Fancy coming up West for a bit of late night dipping and nicking? Come on, I'll show you how to do it. Come on. Come on! Go on, go on, go on, go on Oh yeah, I got a strike! Move! Paul! Come on, keep up! Bet you can't get me! Gonna get you! You feel when I smoke. David Beckham! Beckham. Beckham Barnstable. Yeah I like that. - Can I try? - Don't be a dummy. I wanna know what it feels like. You're only ten. Wait till you're eleven. Oh, go on, please. You got any dosh? I don't mind feeding you but I ain't giving you my brown. What's it like, Lou? It's like... When I'm hungry, a bag fills me up. When I want to go to sleep a bag sends me to sleep. And when I want a cuddle a bag gives me a cuddle. Don't really need a boyfriend then? No, not really. But you can stay the night if you want. Oh, shit! - I'll get Abu to meet you here in an hour. - Can't you give us some now? I'm in bits Lenny please. - Hands! Louise! Paul come here! Come on. Where's your Mum, Paul? Don't know. I don't know, honest. Don't worry, I'll find her. Where you been? - I spent the night with Louise. - You never! - I did. Slept in her bed. - Unreal. Did you go all the way? - Not all the way. - Why not? She's pregnant already. Come on. 'Ere, where the hell have you been, I've been worried sick? Your mother might have let you run wild like a weed, but I'm not. From now on you don't do a thing without me knowing about it. Do you hear? - Yes, Nanna. - Good! - Nanna? - What? - Can you let go of my ear now? We'll give her another five minutes and then I think we'll call it a day. This is just typical of her. Mummy's here, Lee. You're twenty five minutes late, Mel. I had to walk. Well you're here now. Let's make the most of the remaining thirty five minutes. Why don't you sit down? Say goodbye to your Mum then. Get the bus home, Mum. You said you'd help her. - We are, Paul. But we can't help your Mum if she doesn't want to help herself. What do you mean? Mum? True ain't it? You're doin' nothing to get us back. You never lent us, Helen took us. Just like she did to Louise's baby. You liar! - Please Paul, let's go now. You love being on the gear don't you? That's it. You love it. And you love Lenny. You love Lenny. You love Lenny. - I hate him. Tell you what! Go and inject yourself in the neck. You're no good to Lee and me. The way you are, I don't know you anymore! You ain't my Mum! My Mum ain't a dirty junkie. - Paul! - Dirty junkie! Paul! Do you wanna get me the sack or what? - I wanna try it. - This is a twenty bag. How d'you get it? I think you're being dumb. - I want to know how Mum feels. It's your life. Come on. Hello Mum. We're the same now. No. No! You bitch, you gave my son drugs! - Outside! Don't wanna hear what it is. Get out! - He wants to be just like you. - You gave my son drugs! - No I never. It was his gear. - I'll fuck. - You... come with me! - Paul! - Get out! Paul! Paul! Dad! Dad. Dad. Dad. It's me, Liam French. You're okay now. Let's get back to Nanna's There you are, love. You've had a funny do. Doctor reckons you haven't been eating enough. They're not going to let me see Mum, are they? Not until you're both better. - Good. - I think so. You and Lee will be stopping with your Granddad and me for the duration. I'll go and make you a nice dippy boiled egg, and toastie soldiers. Okay? When I was fifteen I got my first job down the docks. Unloading bananas. End of the first day the foreman give me and my mate Tommy a banana each. I'd never seen a banana before. In them days they was a luxury. He told us to take it home and wrap it up in newspaper. After ten days it will be ready to eat. Tommy didn't listen, he ate his green. Give him tummy ache. I waited and waited, checking it every day. Then when it was soft and yellow, I unpeeled it. I'll never forget the first taste. It was worth all the waiting. All the wrapping and unwrapping. It needed time, but it was worth it in the end. It was wonderful. Louise! You alright? What's wrong? - I'm having the baby, get an ambulance. Oh, shit! Fucking shit! - Louise! - It's alright. Your sister's okay. - I'm not gonna lose it am I? Not if I can help it. Who did this to her? - Don't know. A night at the Ritz. Room service, bed and breakfast. You just need to pop little Beckham out first. - Stay with me. I don't think he wants to see any of that business. He's only a kid. - You can give that to your sister. - Will he be alright? He will be, when we've helped him get off heroin. You alright? It wasn't my fault he came early, it was yours. - What? - I lost my job because of you. Harry couldn't have anyone thinking his caf had anything to do with gear. And it's all your fault. Your fault Lenny beat me up. He doesn't even know Beckham's his. Maybe they'll let me see him tomorrow, d'you think? She's gonna take him away, ain't she? That Helen, ain't she? - Ssh Louise. - Don't you ssh me! If she's gonna take away my Beckham, like she did my Charlene then I'm staying on gear I ain't got nothing else left, have I? You get away from me. You get away! Piss off! You can't just sit there. You have to order something. I'll have a coffee, please. What would you like, Paul? It's on me. Double bacon cheeseburger, a coke and some chips please. Anything to tell me? To put Lenny away I need to catch him with a large amount of heroin. That means picking him up just after he's taken delivery of a big supply. - Do it then. I've had him under surveillance but I still don't know where he does the collection. Maybe somebody does it for him. - Me? - Maybe. - Oh yeah. Really. No wonder you can't catch him. Okay. You know Lenny better than I do. If you hear anything, give me a call. Cheers Harry, thanks a lot. - Lenny! - Hello. - What a lovely surprise. - Yeah, how are you? Alright? - Oh, yes. Yeah, I was just passing, I thought why not pop my head in, say hello to Mrs J. That's nice. I remember you when you were so high. Building dens with John in the back yard. - Yeah, I miss him Mrs. J. - So do I Lenny. Where's young Paul, then? Mum! Why didn't you write, Mum? Been writing letters every day. I'm sorry love. I didn't get 'em. I moved out the house. I'm livin' in a hostel. - Why? - To get away from Lenny. - He's just been at Nanna's looking for me. - No no he's looking for me. I shouldn't come out. But I have to. Every few days. I watch you and Lee play. When you bother to stay in school, that is. I'm up to all your tricks. Turning up for the register then bunking off! Be none of that when I get you home. - Mum? - D'you know what? My teeth hurt. Everything hurts since I started on the methadone. - What's methadone? - It's medicine. Doctor gives it to me. Stop me from craving gear. Haven't had any in three weeks. Not since that day in the caf. You haven't touched it again have you? - No way! That's what stopped me, you know. Seeing you out of it. - When can we go home? - Not so fast. I just need a bit longer, just a bit. Then I'll be able to face him and say no to his gear. I'd better go. We're almost there. - Yeah. - Just a little bit longer. Stay at school tomorrow. I'll come and see you. - Paul! Let's go then. - Nah, I'm staying today. You going soft or what? Suit yourself. Shit! I just have to tag along I'm afraid, but it will be better. I'm sorry. He's desperate to see you about something, Helen. Okay. Oh I'm sorry can you excuse me for five minutes? I tell you what, I'll give you a ring. - Right, thanks. - Do you know where my Mum is? - What's happened? - I need to know which hostel she's in. - You're not allowed to see her outside access visits. - I need to. - It's not that simple. - It's really important. I won't be making a habit of this, Paul. It's a one off. What's up, Mum? I dropped my bottle of methadone. I can't get any more till Monday. - Can't the people here help? - They don't know I'm on it. They'd never have taken me in if they'd known. I can't do this. - Mum - I can't do it. My body's turning to shit. - But you were doing so well. - Were. I got this really important case review. Got to be there. - What's in a case review, Mum? It's a big meet with everyone where they decide whether I can have you back. - That's great, Mum. - No it isn't. I mean look at me. I can't even get out of bed. You have to. I want to go home. You promised me, Mum. If I only had a little bit of gear. Just to give me a lift. Then I could make it to that meeting. Easy. What happens if you don't have this review thing? It'll be another six months until they give me another chance. - Six months? - Six months. If I just had a little pick me up. Just to make me feel normal. Just one... Oh, shit! I want us to be together again. I miss you, Paul. I miss Lee. - Lenny. - Hello. You alright, son? - I'm alright, you alright? - I'm getting a take-away for me and Abu. You want some? - Yes please, Lenny. - Cheers, Harry. - One burger and chips. So, what's up? You know how you always used to give Mum gear? Can I have some for her now? - Where's she been getting it from? - Nowhere. She's been off it. But she's crap now. Can't do a thing. Can't even get out of bed. I wanna go home, Lenny. Yeah. Yeah, alright then. I've fucked up with you lot, haven't I? Always thought of you lot as family, you know what I mean? You've got your own family. You've got baby Beckham. - Who the fuck is baby Beckham? - You and Louise. She said it was when she did it with you once to pay for some of her gear. Two specials to go, okay Lenny? Baby Beckham. Why didn't she tell me? 'cos she's scared of you. Everyone's scared of you except for me. Police! Hands on the table! - Fucking kill you. - Keep your hands on the table. - Get the fuck. We know this little shit's been running for you. What we got? Brilliant! Bring in the mother. Let's do them all together. - You leave Mel alone. - Or what? By the time you get out I'll be a Chief Inspector, mate. Sorry, son. - Well done. - Lenny won't find out I told you about this, will he? He'll never know. Besides, I wouldn't want anyone knowing that you're smarter than me! Take him down the station. Make sure Lodge sees him. And take him home. - Where's Louise? - Who? - Louise, the girl who lives here. Jim, do you know where that girl moved to who used to live here? - Same time next week, yeah? - Yeah, thanks. See you later. - You alright? - They won't let me see Mum. I've been coming every day. - You can't fight this battle for her. - But she's all on her own. It's the only way she's gonna make it. Without your Dad, without heroin, even without you. Come on, I'll run you back to school. I'll be back before teatime. You wouldn't think I was doing the best thing for this family. Well, things have settled nicely this past month... and that's the way they're staying. Don't spoil your appetite now. After the meeting's over, we're going out for pie and eels to celebrate. Mr Jones for Mel Jones' case review please. Down the corridor. Last door on your right. Ninety degrees, Granddad. - Paul. - Sorry we're late. Hello, Mum. You look great! Granddad got his respirator stuck in the bus door. Hello. I've come to have my say about their future. - I was under the impression your wife spoke for both of you. - So is my wife. - I'm sure we'd all value Mr.Jones's contribution. - Of course. If you'd like to wait outside. She fell apart when our son died. He was the rock of the whole family. None of us knew what to do when he went. Especially Melody. We should give her a chance. - But she's on drugs. - Mel is on methadone. - We could of course consider other options. I want the boys to stay with us. It doesn't remove the problem of Mel trying to hold down her... new job and look after two boys for the majority of the time. I'm working in a supermarket. I mean it's not exactly rocket science for god's sake. You lost your last job because of your drugs habit. Let's see if you can hold this one down first. Whatever you decide you can't hurt my boys any more than I already have. Getting off gear was easy compared to admitting what I'd done to Paul. Look I think it's right that my family gets back together. I suggest we vote. Thank you.
