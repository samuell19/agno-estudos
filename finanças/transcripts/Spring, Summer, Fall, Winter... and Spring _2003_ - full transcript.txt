I'm going to pick herbs now, Master. Watch out for snakes. - Wait for me, Master. - Yes. I've picked a lot of herbs, Master. Really? You've picked a lot? Careful! Stop! Throw this away, my boy. Why? It looks the same. Even though it looks the same, this is a deadly plant. The other one can save lives. It still looks the same. How can I know? Look closely. Here at the tip you can see a white line. If you ate this plant, you'd die. You mustn't pick this sort of plant next time. - Is this one alright to eat? - Yes, this one is good. Master, there is a stone on my back. Please take it off. - Does it torment you? - Yes, Master. Didn't you also do it to the fish? Yes, Master. Didn't you also do it to the frog? Yes, Master. Didn't you also do it to the snake? Yes, Master. Stand up! Walk around! I can't walk, it's too heavy. How do you think the fish, the frog and the snake endured it? It was wrong to do it. Go and find all the animals and release them from the stones. Then I will release you from yours. But if any of the animals, the fish, the frog or the snake is dead, you will carry the stone in your heart for the rest of your life. Summer You look so very healthy. This tree is over 300 years old.

The world of men has grown agonizing for you, hasn't it? Leave alone, Master. Can you not see I am suffering? What causes you to suffer? My only sin was to love. I wanted nothing except her. So? She went with another man. Ah, that was it. How can that be? She said that she'd love only me. - And then? - I couldn't bear it any more. Didn't you know beforehand how the world of men is? Sometimes we have to let go of things we like. What you like, others will also like! But still, how could she do that? The bitch! - Is it so unbearable for you? - Yes! Master! Young fool! Though you can so easily kill, you yourself cannot be easily killed. Carve out all of these characters with the knife. And while you cut out each one, drive out the anger from your heart. Holy one!
