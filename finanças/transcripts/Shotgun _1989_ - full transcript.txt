Arrange to move the whole operation down there. We don't have to worry about the authorities. Money talks very well in Mexico right now. This could start a war. Relax, Rocker. Remember, I've been doing this since I was in law school. These people follow money and power. And I have plenty of both. Mano didn't care. He wouldn't sell. Mano was stupid. Now he's dead. Now I have to be in court soon. Set up the village, double the guard. I want that place to be a fortress. [exhales] Sandra, would you come in here please? And bring the Capallo files.

Maybe some other time. Sometimes I wish I wasn't a cop. Oh yeah? Yeah, then I could hate cops and figure out ways to beat the system. You do that anyway. I don't hate you. Doesn't count. I'm your partner. Oh, Rhonda hit big time tonight. That John will drop enough coin on her, she'll take a vacation a month. Huh? Wha-- Aw, damn! That's too bad. I'm going to miss her. Max, you and Rhonda? Nah. But it's one hell of a fantasy, huh? Mhm. Does Janice know? Oh yeah. I have Rhonda, she has you. It keeps our sex life interesting. Well I hope I'm good. [chuckling] Hey, baby. Hello, my friend. OK, $19 for the room. One buck for the skin. We don't need the rubber. Then you don't need me, buster. Have a good time, right? We're here. RHONDA: Ooh, I like the outfit. So, how do you want it? Lips? [moans] Or hips? I think lips. Ooh. [growls] [punch] If it's going to get rough, buster, it's going to get expensive. Then it's going to be very expensive. Get undressed. Get undressed. Slowly! Very slowly. OK, OK. Watch me, baby Watch me close.

Patrol units [inaudible]. 23 will respond. [tires screeching] Look, man! Already told you, OK? All I know is the guy wears fancy clothes! And you really know why he gave me back the rubber. Damn, man. Yeah. Well, put the word out to your guests, there's a basher out there. And he's not playing games. One of the great resorts in town. DISPATCHER (ON RADIO): [inaudible] Why would anyone do that to Rhonda? She wasn't into that. She was a hooker, Max! It goes with the territory Bullshit! OK, she was a hooker. But she was also a human being! You should know that better than anyone! (QUIETLY) Fuck. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Come on. Look, let's go see if he still cruising. I want to nail that son of a bitch! [slap] (QUIETLY) It's OK. It's OK. It's only me. It's all right. Relax. You home? (QUIETLY) I'm OK. You look tired. [kiss] (QUIETLY) So do you. (WHISPERS) Go to sleep. [breathes deeply] So how many tonight? [exhales] Leave it alone, Ian. [puts gun down] [drops banana peel] Hello Joey. How about you and I talk? Hm? Come on, Max. I'm clean. You've got no beef with me. Really? You mean you don't deal in kiddie porn anymore? [banging on desk] Uh, Joey, Joey, Joey. Mm, mm, mm. Max, Joey changed his mind. Joey would like to cooperate to the fullest. [breathes deeply] Yeah. yeah. What do you need? We're looking for a guy who likes to beat hookers. He did a job on Rhonda the other night. And we want him off the streets. Now you know all the kinkos around, Joey. What do you got on this guy? He's got money. We know that. We want to know who he is. Look, if it's the same guy I think it is, he came in here once looking for bondage equipment. Bought at best I had. A mask, leather clothes, shackles and handcuffs, and a bullwhip. - How did he pay for it? - Cash. Ah, figures. What else? He's big, real big. Probably pumps a lot of iron, you know? Anything else? Yeah, he's not going to be beating up on no girls no more. Why? Words out. He's poison. His money is no good. The corner girls walk away, and the pimps won't deal. They can't afford the damage. Now Joey, burn the kiddie porn. Or Max and me, we're going to come back and we'll burn your whole sleazy little shop. You're a son of a bitch, Jones. Look, Jones, Billings, nail this fuck! Rhonda, she's a good kid. Nice car. Looking for a party? You like to party? Sure. Get it. I know where there's a great party. Don't do it sweetheart! He's a basher! He doesn't want to fuck you, he wants to put you in the hospital. Well, fuck off, freako. [tires screeching] I couldn't score. None of the girls would have any. The word's out. [deep breathing] [smack] [moaning] Hey Dooley. Hey boys. What can ole Dooley do for you today? We're looking for a basher. The one that did Rhonda? Yeah. You know, maybe Sheri or Francie could help you. They both know what he's into. You know, Sheri's still healing. Thanks Dooley. Hey, uh, Rhonda may be a hooker, but nobody deserves treatment like that. Nobody. You nail that son of a bitch. We will. [knocking on door] SHERI: Who is it? Max and Ian. SHERI: Go away, guys. I don't want it. We need to talk to you Sheri. No bust, I promise. Sheri, please. We already know about what happened to you. We're on your side. SHERI: Come on in. Hey boys. The face, it's just the beginning. Jesus. Yeah. Look, I know I like to get a little rough in the sack. And I get paid good money because of it. But this guy is twisted. The more I scream, the harder he hit. And when I passed out, oh, he really went to town. I've got two cracked ribs, and a hairline fracture of the jaw. The E room doc told me that the bastard damn near kicked out my spleen. And then he went to work with a whip. He nearly killed me. He left $1,000 on the floor, and he never even got me in bed. Sheri, where can we find him? (QUIETLY) I have no idea. All I know is he's got bucks. He drives a big Mercedes, and he with very expensive threads. You better nail this kinko soon. Thanks, Sheri. If you need anything, you know where you can find us. Sheri's right. This kinko just might start doing citizens if he can't beat up the working girls. We may have to wait until he does. Geez. Well, not going to get any help from the street hookers as far as an ID. [groan] With this guy's bucks he can probably by all the silence he needs. And what we need is a complaint from one of our so-called legitimate citizens. Do we have any of those? Oh yeah. Somewhere, I think. That's it. We're out of here. Here you go Max. I'm going to put in a little over time. Are you nuts? Don't you get enough slime on you during the regular shift? More than enough. I just want to log a few vacation hours. You're go looking for Tanya again, huh? Good night Max. Good night Ian. [inaudible] Shake it up for me. Shake it up for me ladies, one time. Ah, yes, indeed. [inaudible] Yes, indeed, ladies. [inaudible] When we get out of here, I like to party in private, if you know what I mean. Sure. [chuckles] What the hell are you doing here? Looking for you. Well, you found me. Now me and my friend here are just about to move. Not until we talk. God dammit, Ian. You're not my keeper. Now leave us alone. Sit down! Is that your answer to everything? Your god damn badge? Leave me alone, Ian. Don't be my big brother, and let me live my own life. I think so. [laughter] Ooh, very nice. Yeah. Look, uh, why don't you get ready? Don't waste any time, do you? OK. [inhales] [crack of whip] Who the fuck are you? [crack of whip] [screams] [crack of whip] [screams] [crack of whip] [screams] [crack of whip] [screams] [crack of whip] [screams] [crack of whip] [screams] Where is she? Max! They're bringing her down, Ian! They did everything they could, buddy. But between the drugs and the beating, there was just too much internal damage. Look, I'm sorry Ian. What does that mean? God Damn! Don't you turn away from me. What does that mean? It means she's dead, Ian! She's dead, buddy. Oh, I need a drink. Oh, Christ, I need a drink. [sustained honk] It's not supposed to go down like this. I'm the one who's supposed to end up dead. I'm a cop. You don't kill the cop's family. You kill the cop. How do you tell a cop's family? She was the only blood relative I had. She was the rebel, and I was always getting her out of shit. First year on the force, I roughed up a guy who had arrested her, for he was too rough. She kicked him in the nuts. I hated what she did, Max. But I loved who she was. And more than anything else, I just wanted to be proud of her. Sometimes I'd come home from the shift, and she'd make me some food. And I could tell she had been working all night. There would always be a fight. Bartender, another. Everybody freeze! [gun cocks] [inaudible]. Move! Move! Move! [gunshot] [screaming] What's the matter with you two faggots? Want to end up like the bartender? Huh? BOTH: Police. [gun shots] [yelling] So you both maintain that you identified yourselves as police officers? That's right, Simms. As a matter of fact, we sounded like a fucking chorus line! The explain the fact to me why no one remembers it! Oh, fuck you, Simms! There was so goddamn much gunfire, most of those people didn't hear their own shit drop into their pants! My point exactly. There is a procedure that's supposed to be followed. You both admitted you were drinking to the shooting team. An innocent bystander could have got killed! Bullshit, Simms! That was a righteous shooting. You god damn well know it. It went down exactly according to book. Except for the fact you were both drunk, and emptied your weapons into the suspect. So what? 32 shots! They had shotguns! They killed the bartender! It looked like Max and me might be next! My partner and I were in a high stress situation, which probably would have given you Hershey squirts. And then you Internal Affairs limp dicks start looking for ways we were wrong! I've had it! You charge me with something right now or I walk! Ha! Come on, Max! I still got some real police work to do. The air in here smells! God damn it! I'm not with you yet! I'm going to get you Jones! You can count on it! Jones, my office now. Jones, I want you and Max to turn your notes on Tanya's death over to Mitchelson and Davies. Why Lieutenant? You're too close to this one, Ian. Come on, Lieutenant. That's crap and you know it. I'm a cop. I can do my job. Under any other circumstances, I would agree. But if you nail this guy, he just might forget that he has a right to a trial. Oh, bullshit! She was just another hooker. She was your sister! I can still do my job. Come on, Lieutenant. If you pull me off of this one, then I will be in trouble. I need this one. You fuck this up Jones and I swear to God, I'll have you walking a beat in the shittiest part of the city I can find. And you'll be walking right along side of him. You got a problem with that, Billings? All you have to do is turn over your notes. Otherwise, you ride with Jones. He fucks up, you both go down. Now get out of here. I got to figure out how to get this by the captain. Thank you, sir. We're going now. When we nail this scum, you better go by the book. As long as he doesn't resist arrest, then I cancel this ticket. God damn it, Ian. That's exactly the attitude the lieutenant was talking about! We've got to go by the book on this one. The lieutenant is already taking flack because you're on the case. I'll behave, Max! By the book. Oh, God help me. DJ: [inaudible] How you doing boy? You looking real good. Huh? You're, looking real good, real good. Real [inaudible] one time. Oh, you're rocking. You're rocking. [inaudible] Hey pops. You know him? He was in here a couple of nights ago. No, don't know him. This guy's [inaudible]. He's my size. They all look alike, they all look the same. [scream] You have the right to remain silent! And sweet Jesus, you had better use it. MAX BILLINGS: (ON SPEAKER) OK, gentlemen, face front. Turn right. Turn left. Face front again, please. Number three, step forward. Number three. OK, step back. I told you he is not there. You're absolutely sure? How many times do I have to say it? The guy that did me is not there. The one that picked me up is number three. Sheri. The guy that picked me up is number three. He's not the guy that did me. All right, girls. That's it. Thank you for coming down. It was kind of nice being on this side of the glass for once. OK, gentlemen, can go. Except you, number three. We have a problem pal. You may just be an accessory to murder. Fuck off. You've gotten nothing. Look, pretty boy, you either turn over on whoever you are shilling for or I say you are looking at some very hard time inside. I can put you at the scene at the time of the murder. I can tie you into numerous assaults. I don't think so. Talk to me, you son of a bitch! Ian! Let him go. The girl you set up to die was his sister. Now I would advise you to tell him what he wants to know. I might be able to get a deal with the DA, hm? I don't think so gentlemen. This is my client. And this is a release order. How do you afford Fletcher Rivington sleazeball? That, detective, is none of your business. Now Lieutenant, release my client, or I shall arrange to have charges against you, your men, and the department! I don't care how-- Let it go Ian! Get out. I have not started my report. Money talks and the asshole walks. It sucks. But it's legal. Remember that Jones, because Simms is looking to nail your ass! Fuck Simms. Go back to work. You've got a report to finish. There is definitely something wrong with this system. [exhale] [giggle] Yeah. Hey Ian, why don't you come over the house, hm? You haven't been over since Tanya's funeral. You could have one too many beers, and figure out why the system fell apart. You don't have that many beers. OK, then you bring a beer. You're on. Max, I hope this isn't going to put Janice to any extra trouble. Sure, it is! But it's for you. Believe me, she won't mind! [clears throat] Honey, I'm home! JANICE: I'm in the kitchen, Max! Hi Janice. Ian! How are you? I'm fine sweetie. I'm just fine. I hope this isn't going to put you out. I don't mind putting out for you. She keeps threatening to leave me for you. What's for dinner, honey? When you don't call, it's meatloaf. But since it's Ian, we'll have steaks. The meatloaf can wait till tomorrow. Janice, meatloaf is fine. I don't-- Hush, hush. I'm just going to pull out a few steaks and Max is going to barbecue I risk my life all day to keep the streets safe from the dregs of the Earth. And I have to come home and slave over a hot grill? Something is definitely wrong. Get to work, buster. I'm hungry. I told it wouldn't be any extra trouble for Janice. [chuckling] Would you like some coffee? No, I'm following a bag. Do you have any beer? - Uh, yeah. - Beer. Beer. Beer is a good [inaudible] thing, yeah. [burp] [laughter] Good steaks. Uh-huh. [laughter] And you cooked them. Yep! [laughter] Nice barbecue! Uh-huh. You use it much? Nope. [laughter] That son of bitch was off before I finished my report. [laughter] I-- I am going to talk with his lawyer. I think you should have another beer. No. No, no. OK. [laughter] Hello Rivington. What do you want? To talk. I have nothing to say to you. [pushes against wall] I have something to say to you slime ball. You are like, the worst kind of sleaze. You protect your clients and their filthy twisted minds behind your fancy car, your $500 suits. He may be out on bail, but this is a warning. Don't fuck up, because if he does, he doesn't get a second chance. I'm going to crucify the bastard. Don't threaten me detective, or I'll have your badge. Kiss my ass. [kick to gut] Uh! [coughs] What, in god's name is the matter with you, Jones? Sir, Jones is-- Shut up, Max! As far as I'm concerned, you're up to your balls in hot water too. Partners are supposed to look after one another. You do not threaten prominent attorneys. Do you know why? Because shit always goes downhill. Rivington called and ripped up the mayor who crucified the commissioner, who pulled the captain's chain. He threatened my pension. And I'm nailing you. All the while, the newspapers are writing long winded articles about police brutality, psycho cops! Next is a lawsuit. The DA's office is already trying to deal this one away! It damn well may cost us the Rocker case. Not the mention Simms is breathing down your neck harder than ever. Lieutenant, Ian's had it pretty rough lately. That fucking puke murdered his sister, sir. Maybe! That hasn't been proven yet! Jesus Christ, Max! You're cops! Department don't give a shit about your problems! Well, it's bullshit, sir! That pimp fucker walks because the mayor is in a piss sweat about his goddamn image. That's bullshit sir. It's the system. And we work for that system. We have to play by the rules, or it all totally goes to shit! It already has! It's OK, Max. It's not OK! It's bullshit sir. Yeah, it is. But as long as we wear these badges, we got to live with it. If we weren't short handed already, I'd suspend the two of you until this thing goes away! Now get out of here. Jones, off the record, I'd have done a lot worse to that son of a bitch. Thanks, Lieutenant. Did you suspend them? No. Why not? Because you suggested it. Now get the hell out of my office! [exhale] It's going down. Move in. All right! It's a freeze! Everyone face down! [interposing voices] Aren't you the cop whose sister used to be a hooker? [punch] Open your mouth! Open your mouth! Let me shut it for good and save the taxpayers some money! Ian! Let it alone! Shut up, Max! I'm tired of these scum suckers mouthing off! What the hell would it matter? It wouldn't matter worth a damn! Go ahead! Shoot the little fuck! Do it! Go on right down into the sewer and blow him away! And then he and I will bust your ass! Book him for possession, sale, resisting arrest. Take the cuffs off him Jones. What? Why? He's IAD. And you're under arrest for assaulting a police officer. It was a set up? (QUIETLY) I told you I'd get you. Now you're through. You're out of the department. You son of a bitch! [punching] [screaming and punching] I'm sorry Ian. Not as sorry as Simms. Internal Affairs says he'll be out of the hospital next week. Guess I didn't hit him hard enough. You're a good cop. You got the shit end of the stick, but at least it's only a six month suspension. You get off light. Simms wanted them to take your badge and throw it away. And they might have done it if it hadn't been for your record. So what are you going to do? You know the bounty hunter law. I figured it can keep the bills paid. So for the next six months just call me Josh. Good luck. [typewriter clicking] Excuse me. What? I'm looking for Mr. Devlin. Ms. Devlin. You? That's me, B. Devlin. Barbara to my friends. What can I do for you? My name's Ian Jones. I'm looking for work as a bounty hunter. We prefer the term skip tracer. You any good? I was a cop. I'm on suspension for busting up an IAD investigator. That in itself is worth at least a try out. The job pays 10% of the bail, and all the seeded expenses. You get paid when the skip's behind bars. 10%? Any fringe benefits? No. Not even dinner with the boss? She might be a little more successful if you tried lunch first. Here. Here's your first one. Mrs. Thompson. Jumping bail and contributing shame, shame, shame. 10%, firm, in cash. Yeah, thanks. Thompson's on ice. Good. Thanks. Don't thanks me, just write a check. What's with you? You'll always get your money. I don't know. Just that time of month Yeah, well, do me a favor. Take two Midol and call me in the morning. Meanwhile, I've got another one. Up on a gun running charge. Out on $50,000 and he skips. 10%. As usual. [phone rings] [exhales] Well? Well what? The test results. Did you pass? Yeah. All right! That's wonderful! I am now Detective Sergeant Max Billings, complete with my own office. What's wrong? Well, I had always thought that Ian would be here with us to celebrate. Well, call him. I have! He won't even talk to me. He's changed, Janice. And so have you. Hey, listen. I never dated a sergeant before. [kiss] How about a date? [kiss] [truck engine] [siren] All right! Freeze! [gun shots] Yes sir. Yes sir. So you made Sergeant? And you're eating healthy food. Congratulation. Ian, are you trying to put me into an early grave? Why? That bail jumper you popped yesterday, he was the main connection to a major drug and gunrunning setup. Yesterday you blew eight months of undercover work, not to mention damn near killing one of our own people. He jumped bail. Barbara wanted him brought in. I brought him in. Max, the system works. Dammit, Ian. There are some things more important than your lousy bounty money. Not to me. Who do I give my statement to? I still have a check to collect. Forget it. Our undercover guy told us what happened. I don't need your statement. You know the streets are calling you Shotgun Jones now. It's better than what they call me when I carried a badge. Fucking pig. Hello Jones. I hear you're a bounty hunter now. I hear you're still an IAD shithead. I hate to interrupt, but is there something I can do for you Simms? It can wait Sergeant. You better watch yourself Jones the streets don't like you. So what? Nothing's changed. Except you don't have the department backing you up anymore. That man leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Yeah, well, I'd love to stay and talk about the IAD slide pit with you Max, but I've got a living to make. How do you do it, Ian? You were the best cop in the business. And now you're a fucking bounty hunter. We prefer the term skip tracer. Sergeant Billings, I like that. Thanks. Sergeant Max Billings. Sounds good to me. [motorcycle engine] [exhales] [kicks] [exhales] Leland, wait one second, guy. [kicks] [tools drop] Who are you? Are you Johnson Coolidge? Who wants to know? Heard he was the best when it came to cars. Yeah, I am. I can steal them, customize them, fix them up. I can do anything-- You ever got caught? Once, but I got away. I mean, look at this fucking place. They can't fucking find me, man. Well, I can fucking you man. You are busted. Ah! [punch] [gun cocks] [gun shot] Aw shit mother-- mother of God! You fucking asshole! Shut up! You mother fucker! Shut up! You fucking shot my asshole! You fuck! Shit! If I wanted conversation, I would have shot Dick Cavett! Aw shit! Mother fucker! Barbara. pay me. Add $150 for the ER treatment. You work too hard. Are you all right? I'm fine. Gah! I just broke a wrench. Coolidge is still on the table getting rock salt pulled out of his butt. What do you this for? It's a job. EMPLOYEE: Hey baby, telephone. Thanks, honey. Yeah, Jones. Jones, it's Max. Rocker jumped bail. Thanks Max. I was just about to call you. Rocker jumped bail. I want it. You got it. Ian, don't make it personal. Yeah . [snaps] Key. Hello, my friend. Get out of town. Head for the village, I'll join you there. Be careful of Jones. He's turned bounty hunter. And I'm sure he's going to be coming after you. Yes, sir. This sucks! I know, Ian. But that's what they want. They want you to give up the paper on Rocker. Why? Because the DEA thinks he's a main connection to a major drug dealer who's based in Mexico. If you bust him, their whole investigation goes to shit! That's their problem. I don't particularly give a shit what they want! The commissioner is willing to reinstate you. Shit! I make more money on one skip trace than I do in three goddamn months as a damn Detective Sergeant. And I don't have to worry about any goddamn IAD gestapo asshole just setting me up for falls! Don't bullshit me, Ian. This is Max. The only thing you ever wanted to be was a cop. It's the only thing you're good at. And goddammit, I need your help. So to get my badge back, I have to play footsie with the department and give up the man who murdered my sister! The whole thing stinks. But you get your badge back. I'll think about it. Dammit Ian! Take the deal! The mayor is worried! Fuck the mayor! (WHISPERS) Damn. [crunches tablet] [gunshot] [phone rings] Yeah? Jones. MALE VOICE ON PHONE: You're a dead man, Jones. Who the fuck is this? [phone drops on receiver] [gun cocks] Pew! Someone's put a contract out on me. [phone rings] Homicide, Billings. (WHISPERS) Yeah. They just found Broadway Joe in his shop with a bullet hole between his eyes. Mind if I tag along? Just behave yourself, hm? You don't have your badge back yet. [camera shutter] They dug a 45 out of the wall from behind Joey's head. The bullet went right in here, and went right out the back of his head. They're still digging brain matter out of the wall. Hey, how's it going, Jones? Gee, I'll bet the back of Joey's head is a real fucking mess. So much for his civic duty. Joe was going to testify. Rocker's out for revenge. He's off the deep end, man. Hey, you were my partner. If there's a list, you could be on it. Can you prove that? I don't have to. I'm not a cop, remember? [slurp] [gunshot] [screaming] Oh, you stupid bastard. Didn't I tell you to watch out? (QUIETLY) Ian, let the department handle it. Why? So the DEA can blow that the deal when some lawyer does this. [snap] I've got a more permanent idea. The scam jumped bail, and I'm a bounty hunter. Ian. Ian. [blows nose] How you doing? It I'm looking for a guy by the name of Rocker. Sorry pal, I don't know him. You know? He's a big guy. He's my size, little beefier. Clean shaven, my coloring. [sniffs] Hey, look my friend, I mind my own business, OK? Freeze! [gunshots] [gun cocks] [punching and fighting] [tires screeching] [body slam on car] [tires screeching] [body slam into boxes] [tires screeching] [kicking boxes] [gun cocks] Anybody ever tell you you make too much noise? Only faggots, pimps, and bad tempered desert hermits. [car door shuts] Ian Jones, want to hell brings your ugly kisser to a mad man's desert highway? I need your help Sam. I'm going after a guy that I need to get. He skipped across the border and he's holed up in a fucking fortress. And I thought you might have some ideas. I thought you were carrying a badge. You can go into Mexico. I used to carry a badge. Now I carry this. [laughter] Ian, you ain't changed a bit. Ian, let's go have a couple of beers. All right. Thought you'd never ask. Yeah! Did you get that hole fixed? [hissing] [whoosh] [hissing] [machine gun] [circular saw] [truck engine] I like it. Sam, I owe you one. Yeah, then take me along. It's not your fight. Come on, I built this thing. You need somebody to drive it. Somebody's got to handle the fifty. You never could drive worth shit. So where are we going? A little town named Puerto del Sol. And I don't really know where it is. I do. It's about two hours down that dirt road. There was a stopover for illegals coming over the border. Let's go back to the trailer, get some extra firepower, charge up the flavor, and kick some ass. Rock and roll. Hoochie coo. [truck engine] [explosions] Give it up or kiss it good bye! No lawyer saved you this time! [explosions] [truck ramming through gate] [machine gun fire] [explosions] [gun shots] Jones! I can give you the guy who runs this operation!
