[traffic noise] [car revving] [jackhammer whirring] [siren wailing in distance] [car crashes] [somber music] [somber music continues] Okay, there's no way I'm gonna do the dishes today. -I did them yesterday. -I did them last month. -I did them last week. -I did them last year. -That doesn't count. -That counts! -No, it doesn't. -Yes! -Scissors, paper, stone. -Fine. [both] Scissors, paper, stone! -I win. -Two out of three. Fine. [both] Scissors, paper, stone! I win again. This is not fair. Let's do in Chinese. Excuse you, it is fair! -It's not fair. -It is fair! -Chinese! -Fine! Stone, scissors, paper. I win, once again! It's scissors, stone, paper. [Stacey] Hm. [in Chinese] Do you know how to get to Grand Deity Temple? I have an app that can give you directions. -We won't get lost. -Hm. Don't worry, I will take care of Nick. Take care of me? We're the same age. But I'm taller and smarter than you. [in English] So? Mom, I need your camera for tomorrow. Hm? [Sarah] I need your camera for tomorrow. Oh. Okay. [dings] [bell tolls] [meowing] [bell dings] [meows] [calm music] Welcome to Hot Talk. I'm Ken Kasey. We're here with our regular guest, the very, very, very beautiful Jo Yang. Jo Yang is an accomplished writer, speaker, and a no-nonsense intellectual, unlike myself. Who is this on the phone lines? Hi, I'm Mandy. -Hello, Mandy. -[Bobby] Hey, Mandy. -[Mandy] Hi! -[Bobby] What's your problem? [Mandy] Well, I love him, but I don't know if I love him, love him. -[Ken] You don't love him, then. -Um... I'm sorry, Mandy. Go on. [Mandy] Well, we're getting our keys to our new flat next week, and our wedding dinner is at the end of the month. -Congratulations! -[Mandy] Thanks. But, my dad says it's never too late to back out if you're not sure. How long have you two been dating? [Mandy] Too many years, perhaps. We met in secondary school, we were in the same swimming club. We fell in love in the pool. [Ken] Oh, that's so sweet. So romantic. So old-fashioned, Mandy. It's very rare these days. Jo, your thoughts? -Well, Ken, I'm a realist, unlike you. -[Ken chuckles] And I like to base my decisions on the worst-case scenario. As some of us may know, men can sometimes be very creative in making your life miserable. So, Mandy, without knowing your fiancé, I find it very hard to judge his potential in causing you misery. But, if you think, um, you know, you have reason for doubt, I think you ought to spend more time thinking these things through. [sighs] [in Chinese] Hello, students. The phrase of the day is, "If winter is here, will spring be far behind?" This is the last phrase from the poem Ode to the West by English poet, P. B. Shelley. Spring, summer, autumn, winter. We experience four seasons a year. Although winter is cold and harsh, after winter comes joyful spring. It's just like preparing for your exams. Although it's tough, you'll get two full months of vacation after. That's your spring. Teacher, it's always summer in Singapore. It doesn't matter. This phrase is frequently used to encourage people. Before we begin, please submit your homework. Who is yet to give their homework? -[Mandy] That's how I feel as well. -Mm-hm. [Mandy] Because lately, he's been getting on my nerves. -[Ken] How so? -Oh. [Mandy] Well, he wants his ex-girlfriend, Megan, to be one of the bridesmaids. -Okay, that's, that's different. -[Mandy] Exactly. But it's original, Mandy. I've gotta give it to him for that. I wonder why I haven't thought of this things. Mandy, Mandy, did he say why he wants Megan -to be one of the bridesmaids? -[Mandy] He did. He wants everyone to know how lucky he is. -[Jo] Aw. That's very sweet of him. -[Ken] Aww. Bullshit! [clears throat] That's very sweet, by the way. -[Mandy] Really? -Sure, don't you think so? [Mandy] I'm afraid. What if... What if he rekindles the flames that he had with Megan? [Mandy] Exactly. Yeah. So, do you know Megan well? [Mandy] Sure. She was my best friend. I know Beckham through her, and Beckham was her boyfriend, but now, he's my fiancé. Okay, Mandy. You know what? Have a great marriage to Beckham. All the best. And like we say on Hot Talk, -"Love conquers all." -[button clicks] [in Chinese] I believe most of you are familiar with Singapore's early history and the hardship our forefathers went through in building Singapore. [Stacey] Let's start our activity for today. Yes, Xiao Fen? [Xiao Fen] Teacher, I know. Stamford Raffles found and built Singapore. Students, please answer and discuss in Chinese. This will help you with your oral exams. Stamford Raffles found and built Singapore, followed by immigrants from China and India who made Singapore what it is today. Hm. See, practice makes perfect. Did everyone understand what she said? Teacher, from what I've researched, even before Raffles landed, Singapore was already a bustling port city. [Stacey] Our activity for today concerns this topic. Form your groups and pick an item in front of you. Investigate the history of Singapore through the item you've picked. Take this picture, for instance. Who are these people? What are they doing? What era was this in? What contributions have they made? After you've done your investigation, submit a small group report. Any questions? Teacher, will this contribute to our final grades? Does it matter? Yes, so only smart people can be in my group. [student #1 sighs] It doesn't matter. My dad says everyone in China is learning English. In the future, they will understand what we're saying. He said... [in English] "There's no need to learn Chinese." [in Chinese] Yes, I am learning Korean right now. It's not old-fashioned and it makes me look cool. [in Korean] Annyeonghaseyo. [cheering] [in Chinese] As promised, you can burn the books after exams. [all cheering] [in English] [man #1] High-five! [woman #1] High-five! [chuckles] [in Chinese] [man #1] Make sure you get good grades. After the final exams, parents organized a book burning session. This has sparked public debates. These children seemed very excited and happy. A neighbor claimed that they were burning a photo of the student's Chinese teacher. Professor Sun, what are your comments? I find this incident ridiculous. No matter how much you resent the system, one should not allow their children to celebrate by burning books. [Sun] It doesn't matter what books are burnt. This action shows a lack of respect for knowledge. This will impart the wrong values to our children. This is similar to Emperor Qin burning books 2,000 years ago. Let's not politicize this issue by linking it to Chinese history. For me, there's nothing wrong with it. The books and money are theirs. They are free to decide what to do with them. [woman #2] This shouldn't concern us. We are in an interconnected society, shouldn't we be concerned? Our society is made up of many different groups. It's built upon social norms and moral values. Should the minority assent to the majority always? Does the majority determine right or wrong? [Sun] Yes, we cannot dictate how one leads his life. Everyone has the right to choose their preferred way to express themselves. But book burning is too extreme. Children may not understand the consequences of book burning. [woman #1 speaking Chinese] [continues speaking Chinese] [calm music] [in English] You're on the air with Hot Talk! -Who's this? -[man #1] Hello. Is this the show that helps people to decide? That's what they say. Our guest host here, Jo Yang, helps you to weigh your options, so you can make the best decision. Who's this? -Some of my friends call me Lee. -[Jo] Hello, Lee. Hey, Lee, what's your problem? [Lee] Well, I can't decide between a prostitute or a loan shark. Tough decision, very tough decision. As a date? [all laugh] [Lee] No. I'm sorry, Lee. We've been getting a lot of calls about relationships lately. What's your dilemma between the lady-of-the-night and a loan shark? [Lee] I'm planning to kill one of them tonight. But just one. Well, sounds like you've made up your mind. I don't think you need us. -[Ken] Yeah. -[Lee] Yes, I do, Jo. I need your opinion. Oh. Really? Okay. Tell me, why do you want to kill them? [Lee laughs] [Lee] Why do you need to know? Do you even care? You know, I'm not a cop or anything, Lee. But, uh, I'm guessing even if it's between a prostitute or a loan shark, if one of them dies, you're gonna get in trouble by the law, right? [Lee] Mm-hm. You know what I'm thinking here, Jo? I'm thinking, this is one of those psychological tests. -Oh, yes. -[Ken] Yeah. -And we're doing so badly. -[Ken] Failing miserably. -[both chuckle] -It's not funny! [Lee] No. This is not a test. Tonight, someone will die. And Jo gets to decide. -Why me? -[Lee] We all have our reasons, Jo. But right now, all you need to do is to make a choice. A choice that will show us who you really are. Okay, I know who I am, Lee, and I'm not interested in this game. [Lee laughs] [Lee] This is not a game. You will decide who dies. And what if I decided not to choose? [Ken] Yeah, exactly. Why can't I choose, Lee? Yeah, that's right. Let him choose. Ken loves choosing. [Ken] I love choosing. [Lee] Jo must choose. If you don't, both will die. I'm choosing... not to choose. [Lee] Jo, in your book, you said that we are in control of our lives, masters of our own fate. [Ken] I haven't read the book, but I heard it's good. -You bet. -[Lee] And, two people will die, because you can't make up your mind. All right, Lee. This is getting ridiculous. No one's going to die tonight. [Lee] Jo, prostitute or loan shark? Who deserves to die? Neither, Lee, and you know what? This game is getting no fun at all. I agree. You know what, Lee? Your problem is a little bit above what we can handle here on Hot Talk. But, you know what, thank you very much for the call. Give us a call back in a couple of months and let us know how you're doing, okay? [Lee] Jo, make your choice! Prostitute or loan shark? -No. -[Lee] Just say it! [Lee] Tell me who do you want to save? All right, all right, fine. -I'll save the prostitute. -[Ken] There we go. [dings] [bell tolls] [meows] [bell dings] [bell tolls] [sighs] [bell dings] [camera shutter clicks] [foreboding music] [Ken] What was that about? -[Wei Wei] It's all your fault! -[Ken] How is it my fault? -[Wei Wei] You attract all the weirdos! -You let the callers through. -[mumbling] -Liz, what do you wanna do about this? -Nothing. -Nothing? Nothing. Business as usual. Anything on the news? -No dead loan shark. Maybe not yet. -Great. Good. Nothing to worry about, then. Are we breaking any laws? Legal's on it. So far, we're good. Okay. Online? [Wei Wei] We have over 7,000 comments on our website. A few hundred more on Ken and Jo's public pages. [Wei Wei] Things are going a bit crazy on the forums, we're tracking those. For whatever reasons, we're driving lots of interest and online conversation. Excellent. This is all good. This call is exactly what we need. [Wei Wei] Yes, I like the buzz. -Guys, what if he's real? -[chuckles] I'm just saying, what if this guy actually kills somebody? Do you realize how many copycat callers we're going to start getting? People asking us to decide between moms and dads, cats and dogs, maybe bankers, telemarketers. Seriously, everybody wants their 15 minutes of fame. [Ken] Is this the kind of show you want, Liz? What are you now? A doomsday guru? I'm just saying. What if he's real? [Liz] Listen, nobody knows. Business as usual. Period. [phone ringing] [ringing continues] [phone beeps] -Hello, Mr. Tan. -Jo. Yes! Hi, Jo. Sure, I'll get back to you soon. Okay, see you later. Bye. [Wei Wei] Jo wants to know if we're still going ahead with the show and if she should come? Yes. Of course. Business as usual. [Liz] Toughen up. Fine. [in Chinese] What's up? Why are you so upset? It's because of my students. Hm. [Jo] Thank goodness for your students. If they didn't upset you from time to time, I wouldn't be able to taste these delicious homemade cakes. You should've learned. I wish, but mom prefers teaching you. Stop finding excuses. You're just lazy. Since when have I ever been lazy? [Jo] Yang Yan, I've never been lazy before. Even if I was lazy, that was the old me. As the proverb says, "With every new experience comes wisdom." I learned my lesson and I'll never be lazy again, Teacher Yang. Isn't that how you write your Chinese essays? -Yes, you're right. Help me clean up. -[Jo] Mm. Let's talk about it after I finish texting. Lazy bum! What time are they coming home tonight? They'll be back after the movie, don't worry. Only you would allow them to catch a midnight show. [tranquil music] [camera shutter clicks] [calm music] [camera shutter clicking] [camera shutter continues clicking] [in English] Hey, why did you do it? What if the temple has CCTV? They don't. I've checked. So, you've done this before? No. [Sarah] Are you sure? Yeah. And stop judging me. I'm curious, that's all. Why did you steal the wallet? I didn't steal it. It was lying on the floor. I saw it, I picked it up. It's not stealing. Stealing is stealing. Stealing is such a harsh word to use. What should I call it, then? Redistribution of wealth? Here, I stole it. Do you want it? I want half. Why are you keeping that extra 50 dollars? I saw it, I took it. What's your contribution? Keeping quiet. Fine. You're crazy. So, getting your mini iPad? I want it, but maybe not now. Delayed gratification. I know that. It's in my mom's book. I'd like to grow the money first. You totally should. And, how do you plan to grow this money? [ominous music] [foreboding music] Hi. [cashier] Anything else? -[Young Finn] Ah. -[cash register beeping] [cashier] Are you a part-time driver? No. Of course not. [cashier] Thought so. You look too young to drive. [cashier chuckles] Ah. That's my dad's taxi. [cashier] Ah. I see. [in Chinese] I've gotten everything we need. [light music] Where are the teacups? -We're not using teacups today. -Why? Today, we'll have the best of both worlds. Chinese tea served in shot glasses. Just like you, neither East nor West. Hey. Isn't our society promoting bilingualism? Here, Teacher Yang. Fine, you win. [both in English] Cheers! [chuckles] Hm. Hm. [in Chinese] So, will we be welcoming a new family member soon? Are you my son's ally? I'll help take care of it. Should I believe you? I'm still undecided. Taking care of a cat isn't easy. If you don't plan to get a cat, please tell your son soon. Give me two more days to decide. Hey. How was your matchmaking session? [chuckles] That terrible? There are some things in my mind that I just can't fathom. Confucius says, "When you are 40, your mind will be clear." A clear mind? How is that possible? I always have things on my mind I have no answer for. I'm so angry whenever I think about the incident. That's right. Dad named you Yang Yan, "Fiery," for a reason. But today, I, Yang Lei, "Headstrong" am angry too. [Stacey] What happened? Work-related stuff. Me, too. How can anyone hate Chinese that much? [Jo] At least no one burnt a photo of you. Soon. [Jo] How is that possible? You are good and creative. I can't even teach our two kids well. He blames me even. Nick? [clicks tongue] No way. [Stacey] Sometimes, I think he's more like your son. He is your son. [Stacey] Yes, he's my son, but he's more like you. What's wrong with being like me? Hey. Come on, tell me about your date. [scoffs] Well... [Jo] What? He's younger than me. [Jo] What's wrong with that? What would people say? [Jo] Come on, what era are we living in? [in English] Who cares? [in Chinese] Today, I received a weird phone call at the radio station. He asked me if he should kill a loan shark or a prostitute. He told me to pick one. Whoever I picked wouldn't be killed. [Stacey] Wow, that's creative. -Don't you find it scary? -[Stacey] How so? If he is serious, he wouldn't announce it so publicly. If he really wanted to kill, he would've done it. Taste good? Hmm. Delicious. Remember to read the essay your daughter wrote. She wrote a funny story about a shark. It's on the fridge. -A shark? -[Stacey] Hm. I think Sarah has the artistic genes of our Yang family. I am confident that she will pass the school's audition. "Pride comes before a fall." "Why praise others by belittling yourself?" [Stacey] Fine, you win again. [in English] Two, nil. [chuckles] [in Chinese] Is Nick auditioning as well? [cat meows] [in English] Hi, I'm Nick Yang. What I'm going to do next is a 360-degree arm-twisting. Um, I'll start now. Would you like me to turn it back? You're going insane. You're going insane. You're going insane! Every one of you kept saying that to me. [heartbeat] But I know what I saw. What do you want from me? Really, what do you want from me? What do you guys want from me? You want me to act like I saw nothing. Look, I don't know you, and I don't know who you are. But I know who I am, and I know what I saw. So, silence me, and I'll scream. Chain me and I'll fly. But yes, I did see a shark in the swimming pool. I'm sure, it was a shark, and it was in the pool. [imitates cat meowing] [light music] [in Chinese] Have you ever thought about having a pair of wings? No, I haven't. [Young Jo in English] No way! [in Chinese] You must've thought about it before. Everyone dreams about flying. Only birds can fly, humans must walk. One must keep his feet on the ground. That's what my dad said. [foreboding music] [foreboding music continues] [rattling] [maid in Indonesian] Tuti, I miss my children. I want to go home. I regret coming here. No, I don't want to stay here anymore. Hold on for a bit. [maid in English] Nathan, don't go too far. [in Indonesian] Where did you go yesterday? Still working? Well, never mind. Natha... I'll call you back later. Okay. This boy is so mischievous. Nathan! [dog growls, barks] [in English] Bobby. What are you doing there, Bobby? [ominous music] [Liz] So, it's true. [Wei Wei] Yes, hot from the news desk. It happened this morning. Has the police confirmed anything? Apparently, he's a loan shark active in the neighborhood. This goes into the news tonight. Are they linking the case to our show? [Wei Wei] Not yet. So, this could be pure coincidence. Could be, or maybe not. [Liz] Nobody knows for sure. What are the chances, really? A caller calls in on our show, threatens to kill a loan shark, and a loan shark is killed. Look, nobody knows for certain that the caller in our show is the killer. But what if he is? -Hello, I'm May. -May. Hi May, how are you doing? [May] I couldn't sleep last night. I kept thinking... What's troubling you? [May] I saw a classmate cheat in the exams yesterday. But, I don't know if I should tell my teachers. My mind wants to, but my heart doesn't want to. Are you 100% sure about this cheating classmate of yours? [May] Yeah. Yeah, I'm very sure. You don't know that. Not even the police can confirm. We could be in the heart of a murder case. We are not. At least not for now. Business as usual. I know. I know you know. Oh. So, you confronted him? [May] Yes, I did. At the swimming pool. And he confessed he cheated. Well, it seems pretty clear what you should do then, May. -[May] Really? -Uh-huh. [May] Hmm. But, it's not so clear to me, -because he's very cute... -[chuckles] -...and then he has a great body! -I understand. Just like me. -Yes! Do you look as good as you sound? -Ken... -Better! Yeah. -[May giggles] -Ken, Ken, this is not about you. -[laughs] And, May, you don't want to go there. -This guy is dangerous. -Ooh. Now, let's get back to that sweet, young boy you were talking about in the swimming pool? [May] If I expose him, maybe I'll sleep better? Yeah, but then you'd lose the boy of your dreams. [May] What should I do? How do I decide? Don't expose him at the swimming pool. Next caller. Hello, welcome to Hot Talk. [rasps] -[Nick] Hey, Alex! -Hi. Can I tell you a story? [Alex] No. Great, I'll tell you anyway. Whatever. Do you like marshmallow? Hmm. Sure. Have you heard of the marshmallow story? [Alex] No. Great! If a crazy guy walks up to you, and offers you a packet of marshmallow, which you can eat for now, or have you wait for two hours and be rewarded with two packets, which will you choose? [Alex] Isn't it obvious? Really? It's that obvious to you? Of course, I'll take a packet now. [Nick] Why? Haven't you heard? An iPad in my hand is worth two in the shop. [calm music] So, is your birthday coming soon? Yes. Excited? Yes. Extremely. [Alex] I'm finally getting my âng-pau from my grandma. And what are you gonna do with the red packet money? Buy an iPad, of course. You've been talking about buying the iPad for weeks. Why wait? I just told you, I'm waiting for the red packet money. [Alex] I'm 200 dollars short! Take this. Really? [Nick] You can return me the money when you get your red packet. Cool. But, you'll need to return me with interest. Sure, double chop. This is an unsecured loan, so interest will be high. [Alex] Fine. Whatever. My Amma normally gives me 500 dollars. I can pay you. No fears, no worries. So, you'll pay me 300 dollars then, deal? Welcome back to Hot Talk. As you know, Singapore is becoming one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in. And we actually have a caller on the line with some financial woes. Bill, what's your problem? [Lee] Hello, Jo. Are you ready to make another choice today? [Ken] It's Lee. The man with the awkward questions. [chuckles] [Lee] Good questions, I believe. Well, you certainly did generate a lot of debate with your earlier phone call. [Lee] Since we know each other, let's get to the point. Jo, what's justice to you? "Justice"? [chuckles] [Ken] Like in truth, justice, and all that fun stuff? -[all chuckle] -Justice to me? How about yourself? [Lee] Callers ask the questions, while you provide the answers. Isn't this the rules of the show? [Jo] Rules. Wow. -[Ken] Lee, I make the rules of the show. -[Jo] We're into... And that's what he does, and I just follow them. -[Ken] Sometimes. -[both laugh] When I'm good. [chuckles] So, Lee, do you follow rules well? [Lee] Why do you ask? Uh, you know, Lee, based on your earlier phone call, you said that you wanted to kill somebody. Do you sound like a man who follows rules? [Jo] He sure does. -[chuckles] -[Lee] Well, I feel the same way about Jo. You don't know me. [Lee] You'll be surprised. Oh, trust me, you don't. [Lee] There is no privacy in this digital age. And creative sorts like yourself, always struggle to conform to the rules. That is such a cliché, Lee. Actually, I do believe in having rules. [Lee] Oh, no. You don't. Trust me, I do. Um, I believe that society needs certain natural laws to keep things from, you know, falling apart? [Ken] Exactly. [Lee] Of course, we can set rules for everything. But can we stick to them? Can you stick to them? I'm getting them off the air! -Calm down. -There's already a dead loan shark. -I'm getting him to wind up now. -No, not yet. -[Wei Wei] This is not business as usual! -Look, I know the facts. And the fact is, we haven't crossed any lines. I'm getting him to end the call now. -No, not yet. Hang on. -Look, Liz, this is important. -I need to take this call. Hello? -You have to listen to me this time. -Please. Look, Liz. -Hold on a sec. Listen, let's ride this for a while. I make the decisions here, and I'm telling you to wait. Hello? Great! [Ken] All right, Lee, you've been a lot of fun, but, uh, we've got some other callers we need to put through on the line. [Lee] What do you mean? It means we'd like to end this call. [Lee] And why is that? I thought the media loves this sort of attention. It drives ratings up. Okay, I've just been informed that someone has been killed. Would you like to comment on this? [Lee] Justice served. "Justice served?" So, you're saying you have something to do with this? [Lee] Yes. I killed him. Why did you kill him, Lee? [Lee] Why? [Lee chuckles] Wasn't it Jo's decision? So, thanks to her, we now have one dead body instead of two. Look, I don't know who you are or what you're trying to do, but you've got to stop this nonsense now! [Lee] And you need to calm down. Oh, I'm calm. Okay. Besides, if you really did kill this man, you know your actions have nothing to do with me or the show, right? [Lee] I thought we were a team. Oh no, we're not. [Lee] No? You made the call, I executed it. Seems like a good plan. Just like the good old days. Don't you agree? Lee, I got a question. Um... Do you think you have the right to take anybody's life? [Lee] Today, Jo needs to decide. A corrupted politician or an overcharging doctor? -[Ken] This is getting ridiculous. -[Lee] Who do we kill, Jo? Oh, there's no "we," stop saying that. [Lee] In a few days' time, will the headlines be, "Dead Politician" or "Dead Doctor"? God! Who are you? [Lee] I need an answer, or both men will die. [chuckles] I gotta tell you something, Lee. You are a barrel of ass, buddy. I'm loving you. But guess what, Lee? Nobody is dying. And better yet, we don't even believe you. [Lee chuckles] [Lee] Someone will die. [man screaming] [Lee] If you cut my line off, both men will die. -No, no, no, stop. Please! -[Lee] Make your choice. You're gonna regret your actions. [Lee] Regret? Don't lecture me about regret. [Ken] You know what, Lee? I've got a choice for you. Why don't you kill yourself? [Lee] Look, this doctor overcharges. This politician takes kickbacks. By getting rid of either one, our society will be happier. You are a sick man! [Ken] So, Jo, what's your decision? I'm not choosing. [Lee] Then, both will die. Well, that's your decision! [Lee] Calm your emotions. Make a choice. [Ken] You know what, Lee? No one's choosing, buddy, you got that? No one's making a choice. I'm not making a choice. Jo, are you choosing? No, I'm not choosing. [Lee] Fine, Jo. By not choosing, you still have made a choice. [foreboding music] The police are here. They need you soon. Figured as much. [indistinct chatter] They're ready for you. -Shall we? -[policeman #1] Thank you. [no audible dialogue] [in Chinese] The phone calls that Jo Yang received are now a hot topic. The public is debating over good and evil, justice and fairness. We all need to make decisions in life. But in Jo's case, she had to choose between life and death. Her decision has resulted in the deaths of a doctor and a politician. Professor Sun, what is your opinion? She doesn't have the power to decide their fate. But she could've saved one life by making a decision. Even if she had chosen, the murderer could still kill both. So, choosing not to choose is the cruelest choice? [clicks tongue] This is such a dilemma. Those who are critical of Jo should make the choice. Talking is easy, having to take action is tough. Qiu Qiu, what would you do if it was you? I hope I never have to make such a decision. If I had to choose, I would rather save one life. Then, who would you choose? I believe I would save the doctor. The politician is corrupt, I wouldn't choose to save him. But Jo doesn't know when she received the phone call. Does it matter? The law should deal with his sin. People should not take matters into their own hands. I didn't mean he should die. But if he is really corrupt, it would be an easier option. It's not in our nature to help someone who has betrayed our trust. So, saving the doctor would seem like the right thing to do. But the question remains. Did the politician deserve to die? Our panel has expressed their views. Do you, viewers, have any? [host] Please continue the discussion on our website. [in English] We didn't kill anybody. Yes, but he was on our show. He said he was killing the two men on our show. [Liz] Look, I get it that both of you feel responsible. But you did not kill anybody. Uh, Liz, we have a dead doctor and a dead politician. -What don't you get? -Yes, we do have two dead bodies. But are you responsible for the killer's actions? [Ken] Oh, you gotta be kidding me now! -Let's put the show on hold. -[Ken] I agree. -[Liz] No, no, no! -Why not? What kind of radio show do you want, Liz? A show where we help a killer pick his victims? -Are you serious right now? -[Liz] It is sad, I get it, but we need to move on. -We also have three dead bodies now. -[Ken] Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Three! Do you understand what three dead bodies mean to any radio show? Why didn't you just save somebody? Really? [scoffs] Who'd you have chosen? The doctor, the politician, at least make a choice. You're asking us to go on air and make a choice? -Why don't you make a choice? -You are stepping out of line now! -[Ken] I'm stepping out of line now? -It's your show we want. Shut up! Please, shut up! I'm sorry. I can't go on air anymore. I just can't. [Ken] I'm out, too. Ken, stop! Look here. The show must go on. [in Chinese] Yes, I heard that the spa was really good. Yes, my friend said it's really comfortable. [host] Can you review it on your blog? I didn't try, but my friend says it's good. [indistinct chatter] [phone rings] [host] Okay, okay. Sorry, I might have to stay back for a bit afterward. These are things that we didn't think would happen in Singapore. -[woman #1] Yeah. -[woman #2] Hm. [host] This radio incident is a double-edged sword. It can be a nightmare or an opportunity. [indistinct chatter] If you handle it well, you can be famous. But if you don't manage it well, it will ruin your career. If that's the case, it's wise not to say anything in public. [all laughing] [host] Like they say, all trouble starts from the mouth. If you have to talk for a living, you must be prepared for anything. [car revving] [ominous music] [ominous music continues] Okay, okay. [foreboding music] [somber music] [somber music continues] [jackhammer whirring] Boy, time to wake up. Grandma, why are you up so early? Today is your birthday. Grandma, I want to sleep a bit more. Happy Birthday. Right, I bought you a new bicycle. Your new bicycle. What's this? A bicycle. I know, but who is it for? It's for you. -For me? -Yeah. Why? It's your birthday present. Don't you usually give me cash? This is your cash. Grandma, this is not cash. It's a bicycle! [dishes clinking] I'm a Chinese teacher and my child failed his Chinese. [Nick] I only failed by two points. What would your teacher say at the Parent-Teacher's Meeting? [Nick] My teacher would definitely be reasonable. Half the class failed. Then, why weren't you in the other half that passed? How can I face your teacher now? [sighs] [Sarah] My results are not out yet. Why do I have to kneel? Do you think you will pass? Please, like that would be possible? [in English] Hi, kids. -[Sarah] Mom! -[Nick] Aunty. Okay, what happened again? It's all his fault. Get up, get up. Come on, Nick. Get up. Be good. [Jo] Okay, so, what did you do today? What happened? Tell me all about it. You're getting really good at this, Sarah. [Sarah] I still can't beat you, mom. Oh, you will. Really soon. Hm. Let's see. Yeah. [gasps] -Dangerous. -[chuckles] I'm almost... there! -No. -[chuckles] [both laugh] [Jo] There you go. You know what? It's gonna be like this. -No, that's not fair! -[Jo] Yes, of course. Mom says so. -No, that's not... -So, it is. -[clicks tongue] -[Jo snickers] -[Jo laughs] -I win. [Jo] Okay, today. [foreboding music] [foreboding music continues] [Stacey in Chinese] Why are you up so late? Trying to catch a thief? -Did I wake you? -Hm. Can't sleep? Wouldn't it be nice if we have a red line? A red line? What do you mean? A red line. A stop line. [snickers] [Stacey] How did they handle the calls? Killer's on-air confession. Ratings are going through the roof. So, that is what's troubling you. Don't think too much about it. This situation is not your fault. Well, I know. But... you don't get it. You should have told me earlier. Share your troubles with me. I didn't want you to worry. Oh. That's what big sisters are for. To share your troubles with. [both chuckle] Hm? Thank you. [toy clicking] [foreboding music] [cat meows] [clicks] [tense music] [both gasping] [dogs barking in distance] [gargles] -Hey, yeah. -[man #1] Come. Okay. [woman moaning] [snaps finger] You, sir? [ominous music] [woman gasps] [moaning] [in Hindi] I think the girls here... may not be that pretty. [man #1] But the other place is always raided by the police. [scoffs] At my age, ugly girls can scare him. [man #1] I'm easy. A hole, and it's a green light for me. Green light means go. [snickers] But it's cheap here, I guess. -[man #1] Cheap? -Uh-huh. Twenty dollars is still a lot of money. I need to make more money. For your new baby? Congratulations. [man #1] No, it's not for the baby. He is fine. His mother has a lot of natural milk. -[man speaks indistinctly] -Yeah. [foreboding music] [panting] [sighs] [in Chinese] Are you afraid? Afraid of what? Afraid of what the future holds. No, I'm not. There's nothing to be afraid of. I'm afraid. [snickers] Really? You're so smart. Why are you afraid? I'm just blessed with good luck. [chuckles] Good luck? Getting into law school has nothing to do with luck. Your grades are so good. Definitely nothing to do with luck, smart ass. [snickers] Thanks to my luck, I managed to get into law school. Or else, I wouldn't know what to do. Hm. As for me, I want to achieve something spectacular. Something spectacular? Such as? Hm. Hmm. I'm not sure. Well, I just want to be famous. [in English] Be somebody. [in Chinese] Or else no one will give a shit about you. -Hm. -Hm. [sighs deeply] [both chuckle] [in English] [man #1] Uh, hello. Hm. [in Hindi] The girl is really good. Oh. [sniffles] Ah. Going to take a shower and rest. Need to work early tomorrow. [sighs] [yawns] [foreboding music] [car revving] -[thuds] -[tires screeching] [thuds] [taps, thuds] [rasping] [wood clanks] [engine revs] -[gasps] -[tires screeching] [in English] Shit! Shit. [in Chinese] [Young Finn] What was that? Did we... Are you okay? [Young Jo] Yes, I'm fine. [Young Finn] Stay in the car. -Wait. -What? Let's go. We can't go. I'll go and have a look. Stay in the car. [Young Jo] No, let's go! Hey! Dong Han! Come back! [sighs] [in English] [Young Finn] Ah, fuck. [car door opens] [car door slams] Oh, fuck! [Young Jo] Dong Han. Shit. [in Chinese] [Young Finn] Where did he come from? [Young Jo] Is he... Where did he come from? Calm down. Don't panic. This is such a secluded place. Where did he come from? Maybe he's an illegal immigrant or an illegal worker? Look at his clothes, it doesn't look like it. We're in trouble and you're looking at his clothes? [in English] Man, we're in deep shit, okay? [sighs deeply] [in Chinese] I don't know where he came out from! You don't need to know. Let's go! No way! Like you said, this is such a secluded place. No one will find out. We can't. We're driving a taxi, there are thousands like it on the road. No one will find us. [sighs] No way. Why not? I don't want to be listed as wanted. [Young Finn] Check if he's an illegal. Does it matter? If he's an illegal, he shouldn't be here at all. Our situation wouldn't be that serious. [in English] Hello! [in Chinese] No matter what, he's still a dead body. Ah! [sighs] [thumps] It wasn't your fault. He came out onto the road by himself. We didn't do anything wrong. No way! I hit him! You feel responsible. But, if you go to jail, will he be revived? [Young Finn] I really don't know. You feel bad. [in English] You're sorry, and that's enough. [in Chinese] The penalty for a hit-and-run is heavy. -Where are you going? -To check on the car. [foreboding music] The car is fine. -[Young Finn] Really? -Hm. Let's wash it, fill up the tank and return it. I'm not sure about leaving him here. Maybe we should check out his identity? There's no need, we were never here. [Young Finn] That's enough! Let's call the police. You want to be dead, too? Call the police, then. Spend your days in jail. But he's really dead. It's his fate! A minute earlier or later, he might not be dead. But he's dead now, and has no options. You're still alive. Do you want to die with him? You have a choice. Do you get it? Fine, I'll take your advice. Let's go. [car engine starts] [engine revs] [in English] All right, what's the matter? You know what's the matter. [sighs] I feel responsible. You know, it has nothing to do with you or us. I know, but... "But"? There was nothing more you could have done. But I feel responsible all the same. You know... choices have their consequences. [Ken] They do. Yeah. [somber music] [somber music continues] [water splashes] [birds chirping] [tranquil music] [camera shutter clicks] [tranquil music] [camera shutter clicks] [telephone rings] [clears throat] -[coughs] -[telephone ringing] [clicks tongue] [telephone rings] [Jo] Hello? [Lee] Hello. Hello, Jo. What do you want? How did you get this number? [Lee] Why? Are you upset? Did I hurt you? No. Just leave me alone, okay? [Lee] Time to make a choice. You got to stop this. [Lee] Why? Do you regret not choosing? Jo, you could have saved a life. Nobody needed to die, Lee! [Lee] Jo, I'll give you another chance to redeem yourself. Say what you want. I'm done talking to you. [panting] [mobile phone ringing] [beeps] [Lee] Time to make a choice. [gasps] [phone beeps] [gasps] [ominous music] [rattling] [thumping] [phone ringing] [phone beeps] [Lee] Nick or Sarah? You stay away from the kids. Do you hear me? [Lee] If you don't make a choice, you'll know the consequences. Who are you? [Lee] Who do you want to save? Who the hell are you? [Lee] You have two options. Make your choice. You know this is not a choice. [Lee] The choice is simple. Nick or Sarah? I can't. [Lee] Then, you'll be responsible for two deaths. No, no, no! Nobody needs to die. [Lee] Nick or Sarah? Say it! Please, don't hurt them. You take me instead. Okay? [stutters] You can take me instead. [Lee] Your daughter or your nephew? Pick one, and I will let the other go. No, no, no! Please, no! -[Lee] Say it or both will die. -No! I... I cannot. Look, I cannot, you know that. [Lee] You can save Sarah, -or you can save Nick. -[sobs] [Lee] Just don't count on having them both alive. Shut up! [Lee] You do have a choice, Jo. [tires screeching] [in Chinese] What's the matter? It looks like he's moving. [Young Jo] Hey! Dong Han! Fuck! He is still alive! [Young Jo] It's not important. We've decided to leave. But he's still alive! [Young Jo in English] Let's go! [in Chinese] We can't go. We have to call an ambulance. [Young Jo] Hey! Finn! Finn. [foreboding music] [in Chinese] He's beyond all help. So, you want to watch him die? I'm saving you! You're going to university with a scholarship. Look, he is most likely a construction worker. He must have taken a shortcut through the woods. He's most probably drunk. It's his fault! These are your assumptions. Do you want to give up your scholarship? I don't want to give it up, but... He is dead, no matter where he is! He might suffer if we send him to the hospital. It's just a matter of time. But now we know that he's not dead! -[gasps] -[sighs] Pretend like nothing has happened. [gear stick clicks, engine revs] [bones crack] [Young Jo in English] Dear, what are you doing? [in Chinese] I want him dead. -[pants] -[engine revs] [Young Jo in English] Dear, stop! [thuds] [engine revs, tires screeching] [ominous music] [lively music] [lively music continues] [kid cheers, chuckles] [sighs] [clicks tongue] [sighs] [Young Finn sighs] [in Chinese] What are we doing here? I don't want to talk. Then, don't! We didn't do anything wrong. I said... I don't want to talk. I'm talking to myself. -I can hear you. -Then, don't listen. Then, don't talk! Why are you angry? Why am I angry? Don't be angry. People are looking at us. [foreboding music] [in English] [Lee] So, have you made up your mind? Why are you doing this? [Lee] It happens. But, why? [Lee chuckles] [Lee] Are we looking for answers now? [Jo] Just tell me, why are you doing this to me? [Lee] It could have been worse. Oh, please. Stop this! Just what do you want? [Lee] Make your choice. Who do you want to save? Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, I'm telling you. I can't choose! [Lee] What happens next, is all up to you. What's wrong with you? Are you sick in the head or something? [Lee] All right, fine. I will kill them both. No, no, no, please, don't! I... I'm sorry. [Lee] The choice is yours. Always has been. I'll give you another five minutes. [line clicks] Hello? Hello? [foreboding music] [foreboding music continues] [car screeches] [in Chinese] We didn't do anything wrong. We did nothing wrong. Yes, nothing wrong. Yes, nothing wrong. After tonight, neither of us should speak of this again. [mobile phone ringing] [mobile phone continues ringing] [phone beeps] [in English] Hello. [Lee] Jo, ready to make your choice? Do I know you? [gasps] Do I have a reason to believe that I know you? [Lee] Make your choice now. [groans] What have I ever done to you? [Lee] Some mistakes can never be forgotten. Finn? [in Chinese] Dong Han, is that you? [Finn laughs] [Finn] You still remember this name. [gasps] It's really you. What do you want? [Finn] What else could I want? You made the choice, but I faced the consequences. You want to put all this on me? You were the one who did the wrong thing. [Finn] My fault? Was it all my fault? I wish we could undo our mistakes, but... [Finn] But it's too late now. I did try to leave the past behind... but it haunts me. Finn, let me help you. [Finn laughs] [Finn] Help me? Do you want to help or harm me? Please give me a chance. [Finn] There's no need for that. I'll make my own decisions now. I really did try to leave the past behind. It's been 20 years. Time for closure. But the children are innocent. [Finn] Nobody is without sin. Okay. Take me instead! [Finn laughs] [scoffs] [Finn] So, you want to sacrifice yourself? Yang Lei, isn't there a window in front of you? If you jump, I'll leave the kids and turn myself in. Make sure you keep your word. If you jump now, I'll keep my word. Okay. Leave the kids. I'll jump.
