Ragu "Only Mum used to make ragu the way I like it. Now that I married you we can only talk about it. I'm not being difficult let's do away with this custom. Yes, all right, whatever you say, now we have to fight? What do you think? Is this ragu? I will eat it just 'cause I need to eat Can I say just one thing? This is meat with tomatoes." This is Matteo De Filippo, eldest son of Luca and Annamaria, and grandson of Eduardo. He dropped out of acting school, and became a cook. He has a restaurant in Madrid. He has two children with Chiara: 3-year-old Luca and little Angelica. And he has some distant memories of his grandfather Eduardo. He was the grandfather of holidays, where we went on Sundays to eat, where we cooked, where we all got together. That's what Eduardo was for me: a Sunday, a Saturday, a celebration. -Hi, Matte. -Hi, Tita. What are you doing? Sauteing mirepoix for the ragu here, oil for the parmigiana there. Great, we'll come and help you in a moment. Look what I found in this old news article from 1957. Someone asked Eduardo, "If you weren't an actor, what would be your profession?" Oh, I have that answer, look… Out of curiosity, if you hadn't become an actor, what would you have wanted to do instead? Well, I can't even think about that, probably I wouldn't even have been born… Wrong, here he says he would have been a cook. And he adds, "A dish prepared as the Lord commands always provokes the unconditional and concordant judgment of all the diners." This is Tommaso De Filippo, Luca's second son and Eduardo's grandson. He is the son of Paola, Luca's second wife. An architect, he looks after the cultural heritage and the foundation dedicated to his grandfather. On the one hand, we try to promote projects within the world of entertainment, on the other hand, the foundation carries out Eduardo's last mission, which is the commitment to give a second chance to disadvantaged youths in the Naples area. Check out what I have here. Now you want to teach me how to make ragu? The more onions you put in, the more aromatic and hearty the sauce will be. The secret is to saute it on a low flame. When it fries slowly, the onion becomes so soft that it creates a kind of black crust around the meat. Lots of onions and low heat. But why don't you show it to us? Because all we have is an audio recording, look: "It was during the early months of magnetic recording and the expensive tapes were reused. So someone erased 'Sabato, domenica e lunedì' too." And this is Luisa, Luca and Paola's last born. She inherited Eduardo's love of animals. Dogs and horses, above all. He had more than 20 dogs and 30 cats throughout his life. The last cat he owned was a female cat named Pallina, he cooked pasta with butter for her, he talked to her, they slept together… She even waited for him, she used to wait for him after his plays at the gate and he would tell her how the day had gone. He treated her like a friend. Eduardo cooked his ragu as he cooked his theater. Two sacred and severe rituals. Nothing excessive, no unnecessary seasoning. Simplicity, that was his recipe. You step onto the stage as you step into the kitchen. He didn't get much sleep, he'd wake up at 7:00 a.m., having gone to bed past midnight, and I would wake up with the house smelling of onions: it was him, cooking at 7 o'clock, he was already at it. And this is Luca, the father of Matteo, Tommaso and Luisa, and the beloved son to whom Eduardo passed the baton of his theater. Luca, who passed away too soon at the age of 67. Eduardo died last night in a clinic in Rome. He was born in Naples on 24 May 1900 and was therefore 84 years old. He dominated the stage for more than half a century, portraying life's stories and people's feelings with great humanity. Outside, a crowd is waiting in the square, a truly immense crowd, as you will see in a few moments. DARIO FO'S SPEECH AT EDUARDO'S FUNERAL November 3, 1984 To be an author of one's own time is very difficult. There have been very few of them in all of history. His theater is not just Neapolitan. PSYCHOANALYST His theater has a much broader scope, touching on the great themes of life. When Eduardo left the stage to become a teacher… JOURNALIST AND PROFESSOR …I saw, witnessed and understood his ability to speak to young people and very young people. Unlike tears, which are emotional… THEATER HISTORY PROFESSOR …and therefore make the viewer lose their awareness, comedy is a kind of pick-lock to break into other people's brains and make them think. Matteo, Tommaso and Luisa have chosen not to tread the boards. But they have the history of Eduardo's theater inside them. And every evening someone is performing it on stages all over the world. Today they are the same age as the De Filippo siblings, their grandfather Eduardo, aunt Titina and uncle Peppino, when, at the end of 1931, they founded the company Teatro Umoristico I De Filippo, which made its debut on the December 25th at the Kursaal Theater in Naples with Natale in casa Cupiello, the comedy that would go on to have a resounding success and a long life. Lucariello, wake up, it's nine o'clock. Eduardo was 30 years old when he wrote Natale in casa Cupiello, but already had a long history behind himself. He already had his gaunt face and ascetic thinness, the result of a typhus infection. He was an illegitimate child, as were Titina and Peppino, and therefore knew since childhood the difficult family dynamics and the unequal worlds of Neapolitan society. And he would depict them in his plays. Curse my head… UNRELEASED FOOTAGE DE FILIPPO FAMILY It is on this day of family chatter with Matteo, Tommaso and Luisa that we will discover something more about Eduardo. Everyone knows his comedies, if only for the phrases that have entered everyday use. Children are children. And so I swore. The night must pass. But what about his life? He was much loved, but people also accused him of being a cold, hard, cruel man. And he let them talk, because he knew where the hate came from. I can be quite unpleasant. There are some artists, actors who were in my troupe who hate me. There are people who despise me, even. People who say, "He's a miser, he's rotten." You don't know how many people say that behind my back. People who wish me dead, who say, "Why don't you drop dead?" It's actors who never got a chance from me to emerge, because they didn't have the talent. Writers who sent me scripts I wouldn't perform. I have a 50-year experience, yet they're not convinced. Do you understand? When I'm writing a play, I'm in doubt for 30 years before I put pen to paper. Do you understand? But they say it's easy. They sit down and, tac tac tac, fill a page with straw, but no. I can be very unpleasant. He wasn't severe as a man, he was severe as an artist… ACTRESS …With himself and therefore the company. I learned stage discipline from him. ACTRESS Virgin Mary… this thing about him being a nasty man… He was severe, he wasn't nasty. He was severe. It's very different. And indeed the story of his life is much more complex… UNRELEASED FOOTAGE DE FILIPPO FAMILY …Few people know, for example, that Eduardo got married thrice, to three well-educated and independent women whom he loved very much, and had two children, Luca and Luisella. And that the latter was the source of great sorrow: Luisella died at the age of 11 after a skiing accident. Yet this did not stop him, he kept writing and performing, every day. Theater was to always be his therapy against the harshness of life. When he put on Natale in casa Cupiello, in the midst of the fascist era, he did so without making any concessions to the prevailing conformism of the time. He staged a miserable family interior, where relationships were depicted as they were: fragile, disordered, imperfect. I don't understand why you have to make this nativity scene. The house gets cluttered, the money gets wasted. If it looked good, at least… It won't even look good. Now he knows it won't look good. As if it were the first time I've made a nativity scene. I am the master of nativity scenes. Well, I don't like it. The difficult communication in Natale in casa Cupiello, through the metaphor of the nativity scene, is the clash between tradition and the new world. Here, between a father and a son, in an unstable balance, with no more certainties. But what must I confess? You sold Pasqualino's shoes. You're a thief. I don't like the nativity scene. Luca Cupiello would like his nativity scene to be appreciated. But Eduardo did not dwell on detail, he sublimated. In the clash between father and son, between tradition and the new world, there is no longer any place for nativity scenes, be they real or symbolic. Only a pitiful final yes, for that affection that unites even in contrasts. You do like the nativity scene? Don't you? Yes. Do you like it? Do you? It was no longer just comedy theater. And yet the De Filippos packed house every night. The public saw itself, laughed and thought. But the criticism, in those early days, was harsh. Do you know what Il Messaggero wrote? "Let the authors be convinced that it is possible to make people laugh even by presenting more decent environments: this is laughter that humiliates." Simoni, on the other hand, wrote in the Corriere Della Sera that "The play is perplexing because of its irritating crudeness, yet it has a strength and power of its own that helps us overcome our disgust." And soon many began to notice. From the pages of Il Mattino, Massimo Bontempelli hoped that De Filippos would soon climb the Italian peninsula. And Federico Fellini, who had seen the play in Rome some time later, spoke of it as a revelation. "The De Filippos portrayed another Italy," he wrote, "abysmally distant from the one that was immediately outside the theater, with its exalted and delirious paraphernalia of Fascist parties." "The De Filippos were ahead of their time. It seemed, through them, we were projecting ourselves forward, towards a new reality about to blossom in Italian culture, which took shape, for example, in neo-realist cinema." Watching him on stage here, Eduardo-Lucariello already looks like a grandfather to his grandchildren, not a peer. One thing that has always fascinated me about Eduardo is how he managed… THEATER HISTORY PROFESSOR …to master the dimension of old age when he was just 30 years old. "I knew Luca Cupiello," he would say, "I knew that character," meaning his own grandfather who was completely incapable of being a father and running his family. And so the fragility of fatherhood is a constant theme with a thousand possible variations. Some people defend themselves from birth. I, for example, have defended myself since birth, perhaps without even knowing it, instinctively. Because I have always believed that man is born old and then gradually becomes young. He himself wrote about his complicated childhood on several occasions. READING BY LUCA DE FILIPPO "I was born in Naples on May 24, 1900, from the union of the greatest Neapolitan actor-author, director and playwright of the time, Eduardo Scarpetta, with Luisa De Filippo, who was unmarried. It took me some time to understand the circumstances of my birth, because in those days children did not have the quick wit and flippancy of those of today." Titina, Eduardo and Peppino always called Eduardo Scarpetta "uncle". At the turn of the 20th century, he was rich and famous, a legend in Naples, and therefore above all gossip. Luisa De Filippo, with whom he fathered the illegitimate Titina, Eduardo and Peppino, was the young niece of his wife Rosa, who had given him three children: Domenico, Vincenzo and Maria. Scarpetta was a generous man: he rented a house near his villa for the De Filippos, mother and children. And every day he sent them a carriage with lunch. He used to say, "They sent us cooked meals from home". In other words, these irregular children, he, Peppino and Titina… STAGE AND COSTUME DESIGNER …lived near Scarpetta, who provided for them like a vast harem. In short, an extended family: Scarpetta looked after the three kids who always followed him backstage. To Eduardo he gave a small antique desk where he made him copy the scripts of his own plays. My father was not 'sweet as salt, ' as we say in Naples. My father used to tie me to a chair and make me write for two hours a day, copying other people's plays, copying his own plays… I got so tired of copying his plays that when I started to perform them I felt sick, I couldn't take it any more, I couldn't take it any more, but I thank my father who put the pen in my hand, who made me study, who made me go on. From memories and accounts scattered here and there, we know that every now and then Eduardo would go to the Kursaal cinema and that his favourite film was Saturnino Farandola. In his biographies, however, he recounted the shock of realizing, at the age of 11, that he was "the son of an unknown father." READING BY LUCA DE FILIPPO "So, while on the one hand I was proud of my father, whose company I had joined, first as an extra and then as an actor, from the age of four, on the other hand, the dense network of gossip, rumor and malice painfully oppressed me. I felt rejected, or tolerated, and ridiculed just because I was different." Eduardo stepped onto the stage for the first time when he was four years old. The occasion was an operetta: La gheisha. An actor had to pick up a child, and it ended up being Eduardo. This is how he remembered it: "I was wearing a tiny kimono my mother had sewn. Suddenly I felt myself being grabbed and lifted up, facing the audience with the spotlight blinding me. I started clapping my hands and the audience responded with thunderous applause. That emotion, that excitement, that fear mixed with exultant joy… I still feel them today, identical to a first performance, whenever I go on stage." On the stage, Scarpetta's children are all the same. Outside, in real life, things are different. Some things were not allowed to Eduardo. Eduardo was about eight years old when, on a hot summer morning, he was sent for a swim in Mergellina with Scarpetta's legitimate children. The company administrator, a Milanese man by the name of Renzi, looked after them The kids jumped in, shouting and laughing, then they began to splash their chaperone, and although he was very annoyed, he let them do it. But when Eduardo, overcome by the general merriment, dared to imitate them, Renzi grabbed him and held his head under water, almost drowning him. THEATER HISTORY PROFESSOR Once he said, he wrote a note: "The family tree of my family was not built according to the rules of civilized living, but according to the law of the forest, where every tree, every plant, grows spontaneously with freedom of choice." In the dressing rooms and backstage areas, Eduardo played and learned the secrets and the workings of theater. Secrets that in turn his father Scarpetta had learned at the San Carlino Theater, the realm of Antonio Petito, perhaps the most famous Pulcinella in history, who spent his life acting and died on stage in front of an astonished young Scarpetta. "A sinister thud was heard on the stage, where Petito had collapsed… FROM THE BOOK "CINQUANT'ANNI DI PALCOSCENICO", EDUARDO SCARPETTA …and while all the other comedians of the San Carlino rushed around him, his sister Adelaide burst into a desperate cry: 'Totonno is dead!'" All these theatrical anecdotes replaced fairy tales and went on to build Eduardo's childhood imagination, so much so that many years later, in 1954, when he inaugurated his theater, the San Ferdinando, he did so with a tribute to Pulcinella. the cupppolone Eduardo would always be grateful to Scarpetta for having, in his own way, innovated Neapolitan theater by inventing a character closer to the times and to the new middle-class audience: Felice Sciosciammocca. Don't think that Eduardo Scarpetta passed this on to me through blood, no. It was through the admiration that I felt for this man, through the admiration and affection that bound me to this kind of repertoire, which gave life to a genre that has not yet ended, that still continues. Eduardo would always carry with him the model of the San Carlino Theater, now kept by his grandchildren. Many generations of Neapolitans had laughed there with Petito and Scarpetta. -This is the front of the theater. -Yes. These are the two ticket booths, the two doors to the parterre, and this staircase led to the boxes. -I see. What about this balcony? -This balcony was connected to the stage and let the actors take a breath of fresh air between scenes. Years later, Eduardo, with his blend of bitterness and humor, would manage to resolve with levity that troubled period in a single line: "The paternity of legitimate children is always doubtful. That of illegitimate children is instead established by popular consensus and becomes a holy truth: my paternity," he concluded, "is indisputable!" So, what else are we cooking? Let's see what Eduardo says… Frittata di scammaro. -That sounds great. -Yeah? We'll put the spaghetti on and it'll be ready tomorrow. Today we cook Eduardo's way, no acting except in the kitchen. Tomorrow, friends and family will be here for lunch, in the country house of Carolina Rosi, Luca De Filippo's last wife. She is the one carrying on the theater company tradition after Luca's death. Cooking as a simple ritual that unites, just as Eduardo liked it and as we often see in his comedies. Many people will come, because Luca, like Eduardo, was married three times: to Annamaria, to Paola, and to Carolina. Just like Eduardo's three women: independent, intelligent, witty. Dorothy Pennington, an American from Philadelphia's upper middle class. Thea Prandi, a brilliant young showgirl from Piedmont. And Isabella Quarantotti, a free-spirited, inquisitive, and rebellious woman. He had a great respect for women, he was also intrigued by them and always made them feel comfortable… He didn't have any of those Neapolitan things, that women were inferior or not on the same level… Eduardo was an extraordinary person. DIRECTOR Eduardo was never light in his feelings, just as Luca never was. Theater always came first. But love was necessary, it was oxygen, confrontation, family. Family was the bond that gave meaning and united, even in the blackest of times. That is why he always sought complicity and communication with his women. He believed in words, in affection. And even today, this new extended family, bears his stamp a little… Luca was aware that in some ways his path was very similar to that of Eduardo, very similar to that of his grandfather Eduardo Scarpetta. This idea of always having to share a loved one with other family members requires a remarkable gesture of love. There were people who were surprised that I had a relationship with Paola or Carolina afterward. For me it was always normal. Break-ups are part of life, and if you grow up in different ways and at some point you feel the need to change, it is only right to do so. We just are. We definitely manage to stick together when needed. Eduardo never wrote about himself. He did not narrate himself, unlike his brother Peppino, who published a long and controversial biography. But he always left clues and scattered memories. For his 80th birthday, at the Franco Parenti Theater, he recited a short verse from The Skein. "Some will want it cooked and some will want it raw about the life of this dead man. But ever more tangled is the skein especially if people want to unravel it." This one is a little rant of mine for those who have always been asking: "Why don't you write about your life, how did you begin, who are you, where are you from, what is your family?". Why does it matter… It does matter. Curiosity is a weapon of knowledge and Eduardo knew this well. In him, curiosity became exasperated empathy, and empathy transformed him into a demiurge of everyday existence. He recounted that when he was a boy in Naples, he and a friend used to go to the courthouse, which became his personal observatory on a humanity made up of "the dispossessed, the ignorant, victims and torturers, thieves, prostitutes and swindlers, heroic creatures and brutal beings, angels believed to be devils and devils believed to be angels." It is from observing men's conflicts with the world, be it family or society, that ideas for his comedies were born. "But in the heart", said Eduardo, "before the brain." A lesson he passed onto young people. Here, he is at the Florence drama school. You don't have to imitate me, absolutely. No, it has to be you and your neighbours, your casual encounters in the street, in, I don't know, meetings. Be observant, look at faces, look at people. Look and listen, listen for jokes, write them down… People say all sorts of useful things in the street, write them down! All those unfortunate lives that inhabited Naples in the early twentieth century, together with the intellectuals and artists who frequented the Galleria Umberto and the Cafè Chantant of the Salone Margherita, became characters in his 57 plays. The candid Luca Cupiello, the pathetic Gennareniello, the arrogant Domenico Soriano, the eccentric Sik-Sik, the simple but wise Gennaro Jovine, the man of honor Antonio Barracano, or the disillusioned Guglielmo Speranza. Middle-class or commoner, they all had a voice. But the most remarkable thing is the soul he gave to the unforgettable female figures at the center of his plays, such as Concetta, Filumena, Rosa and many others. A little bill I need. Eduardo could have played any character: the 8-year-old girl and the 90-year-old old man, even if he definitely wasn't that old. For me, Eduardo was the greatest actor of all, because he played boys and girls, cripples, fools, scoundrels… Everything and anything! And then, well, the pauses that Eduardo used to make when he acted enchanted me, because he managed, with the long pause for example, to keep you, you know, suspended. What's going on now? What's he going to say? Eh eh… I am brave. I like men like that. You do? Yes. All right. READING BY LUCA DE FILIPPO "I write for everyone: rich, poor, workers, professionals… Everyone, everyone! Beautiful, ugly, bad, good, selfish… When the curtain opens on the first act of one of my plays, every theatergoer must be able to find something in it that interests them. And at the end, as I thank them for their applause, my joy is to know that, on leaving the stalls, each one of them will take away something that will be useful to them in their daily lives." Before achieving success in 1931 with Natale in casa Cupiello, Eduardo had already written a dozen comedies… SKETCHES BY RAIMONDA GAETANI …including Sik-Sik and Uomo e galantuomo. Two works that recounted the fatigue and the art of getting by in those poor revue and improvisation theater companies he himself had begun to work with at the age of 15. A world he knew very well. And do you know why I have this voice, a little thin, a little aphonic? Something that's a bit of a hallmark of my acting. It's because at the Rossini Theater the dressing room was dug out of the mountain, so it was humid, and I had my shirts there, the clothes I needed to change into. After two or three performances I had to wear clothes that were still wet, so my voice went away. Maybe it worked out well, what can I say? Sik-Sik, the story of the poor magician who performs in lowly theaters, was Eduardo's favourite comedy. It was also made into a film: Quei due. The dove that was in the cage, ladies and gentlemen, I made it disappear. And I made it reappear in the gentleman's hat. Let's see the dove. I would say, let's see the chicken. But I made a dove disappear! Trust people on what they know. -Chicken! -Dove! -Chicken! -Dove! The dove flew away, here's a chicken! Eduardo staged Sik-Sik in 1929. It was the beginning of the great game of tragic comedy on which Eduardo built part of his myth. The desperation of hardship and the strength of being able to laugh about it. And Sik-Sik was also the last comedy that Eduardo performed at the age of 80 together with his son Luca at the Manzoni Theater in Milan. I also had a lot of fun. Because I had a great actor next to me. When you have a great actor next to you, you get to have a lot of fun on stage. And the joy of seeing a great actor like Eduardo laughing heartily at what I was doing made me feel very grand. The first time Eduardo and Luca went on stage together had been 25 years earlier at the Odeon Theater in Milan, on December 30, 1955 with the play Miseria e nobiltà. This play is not only famous, but was also the launching pad for all of us Neapolitan dialect actors, because it was written by Eduardo Scarpetta for his second son Vincenzo, who was 7 years old at the time. Tonight Luca will play Peppiniello in Miseria e nobiltà, he too will have the same launching pad. He studied, but he's not a child prodigy, no, he's just a boy like many others, but he has lived close to his father behind the scenes, he has lived close to me when I write comedies, he keeps me company and it has truly been a gift I have received from God. Because he really is a very dear friend of mine, this chap. That production of Miseria e nobiltà marked also the first time Eduardo's theater was broadcast on television, on a Rai TV that was still in its infancy. Eduardo understood its importance, and he used it without letting it use him. Yes, dad, dad, dad… Dad has been through so much trouble between real poverty and false nobility. The tenderness in his relationship with Luca is expressed in this poem that Eduardo dedicated to him: "If I talk to you, I talk to myself. If I see you, I see myself, If I call you there is an echo and that echo is you. If I talk to myself, I talk to you. If you see myself, you see you. If you call me there is an echo and that echo is me." Eduardo spent most of his life in Rome, in this house still full of memories, where Luca also lived. In Rome in the 1920s, after Scarpetta's death, the De Filippo siblings acted in the company of his son Vincenzo. And it was in the spring of 1927, in Rome, that Eduardo met Dorothy Pennington, also known as Dodò. She came from a wealthy Philadelphia family and had arrived in Italy a few years earlier along with her mother and sister. She had probably seen Eduardo in some of the capital's theaters together with Remigio Paone, an impresario and friend of Luigi Gallo, her sister's fiancé. Dodò was cultured, curious, unconventional. He fell madly in love with her and she with him. Each was attracted by the other's dreams: she was fascinated by Eduardo's talent, and by the noisy, colorful and vital world of theater, he by her education, which smacked of good boarding schools, knowledge of foreign languages and of the world. An extremely sweet woman, devoted to love. She was made for love. And she loved Eduardo immensely. DOROTHY PENNINGTON'S COUSIN Dodò was becoming more and more Italian, more and more Neapolitan. She could speak Neapolitan very well, we sang Neapolitan songs together. She was a joyful person who loved life. The beginning of their relationship was not easy. Dorothy's family did not like the actor, who was popular but had little money to his name. Eduardo's mother and Titina were also reluctant. Their families closed off, Eduardo and Dorothy opened up to the world. To be together, they fled to Naples and in 1928 they got married in an Anglican church. Dorothy wore a red dress. They would stay together for almost 20 years, 20 years during which Eduardo and the Teatro Umoristico company would score success after success all over Italy. Dorothy supported him, guided his reading choices and the way he dressed, and translated his plays for foreign audiences. When they separated, he did everything he could not to lose Dodò's affection and friendship, to whom he owed much. The truth was that Dorothy could not bear children, and the woman who would take her place was Thea, Luca's mother. UNRELEASED FOOTAGE DE FILIPPO FAMILY But Dodò knew very well that she had had a special man by her side. "I still hold a grudge, because we shared the first struggles and hardships… DOROTHY'S LETTER TO EDUARDO JULY 6, 1950 …because we dreamed the first dreams of success, and because today, when our dreams have come true, there is another woman at your side. With each of your debuts I feel the same anxiety as in those bygone years at the Kursaal and San Nazzaro. And today still, if the eyes of your heart could see me, I am there, in my box, applauding you." Those were hectic years for Eduardo. And the Second World War had yet to break out. Years of success for the three De Filippo siblings. At last, with their Compagnia del Teatro Umoristico, after a long struggle, their dream came true and they went on to conquer Italian theaters. Their fame spread among intellectuals and those in the theater scene at the time. Visiting them became a sort of must for theater writers and critics. Among these, led almost by the hand by Massimo Bontempelli, is Pirandello. Two little knocks rang at the dressing room door. The maestro Luigi Pirandello is here. I finally met the man I had admired for years. He invited me to dinner. I took courage, and at dinner I said to him, "Maestro, why don't you write a play for us?" He replied, "But I can't write in Neapolitan dialect. Let's write it together." The comedy was to be L'abito nuovo. The three De Filippo siblings began to spend time at Pirandello's house. Dorothy also often went with them. But for Eduardo the relationship became a source of growth and a point of no return. The meeting with Pirandello was explosive, explosive also for the relationship between Eduardo and Peppino. Peppino wrote that he had always blamed his brother for looking for playwrights outside their repertoire. To have sought, in a way, some sort of validation in contemporary theater which he didn't feel they needed at all. Eduardo soon realised that a split from Peppino would be inevitable. Peppino was still bound to the comedic tradition, while Eduardo was looking forward, to his own dramaturgy of reality. Peppino left the company in 1944. Long drawn-out disputes would fill for years the pages of magazines. But life kept bringing them together, even if only for a game of scopone. We knew about their difficult or otherwise problematic relationship. But, at that moment, they seemed to have made up. After lunch, we all sat around a table STAGE DESIGNER AND DIRECTOR and decided to play a game of scopa. With the typical jokes you hear in Naples when playing scopa, imagine those exchanged between Eduardo and Peppino. And we were overwhelmed by it. …hiding in a ditch, because all around there were falling shells and cannon shots. And cannon shots. Don Genna'… Here's the roasted goat… Portion it out and don't forget me. -Nice! -I'm so hungry! How delicious! -What did you prepare? -'Pasta a vongole fujute.' -What would that be? -With runaway clams. One of Eduardo's favourite dishes. That's right. But why did the clams run away? Because during the war clams were expensive and so people did without, instead they used only parsley and oil. I heard that they used to add a bit of anchovy paste too, to add to the impression of sea flavours. Well, I am going to eat. Even the clams ran away from Naples in 1944, a city ravaged by bombs and misery. But Eduardo came back, and what he saw changed his writing forever. Everything was for sale during the American occupation: bodies, dreams, and desires. It was an 'anthropological mutation' that Eduardo sensed well before Pasolini. Times when trust in fellow men was lost forever. The war was a watershed: the comedies he wrote from then on would be 'of odd days'. Those from before the war, 'of even days'. Why do you think wars are fought? To make stuff disappear! Eduardo said that a few weeks after the liberation, he had looked out from the balcony of his house in Parco Grifeo onto his bombed-out city. That was how Napoli milionaria! was born, all in one go, he explained, just like a journalist might write a long article about war. Napoli milionaria! tells the story of Gennaro Jovine, an unemployed tram driver, who returns from the war to find everything has changed: his wife has become rich with the black market, his son has become a thief, and his daughter has been seduced by an American soldier who abandoned her. Gennaro would like to share stories from his imprisonment, but nobody listens to him. Everyone avoids confrontations and heavy truths. Eduardo depicts a deaf and individualistic world that seeks shortcuts, incommunicability, as in Natale in casa Cupiello, many years before Antonioni, alongside Pirandello, Beckett and Ionesco. Eduardo, however, does not want to call it incommunicability, incommunicability is a term that can be used between a man and an elephant, not between two people, and therefore called it "difficult communication". Napoli milionaria! premiered in Naples on March 25, 1945 at the San Carlo Theater, while the war was still being fought in the north of Italy. Isn't the tragedy going on around the world enough? "I was acting and I felt an absolute, terrible silence all around me," Eduardo would tell Enzo Biagi years later. "Then I said the last line." We have to wait. The night must pass. "After the line, the curtain came down, and there was silence for eight or ten seconds, then a furious applause broke out, and also an uncontrollable cry, everyone was holding a handkerchief. I had given voice to everyone's pain." Eduardo wrote a lot in the early post-war years. His theater never became political. "I don't believe in cutting off heads," he used to say, "but in making them think." "Writing a challenging play is easy, the hard part is challenging the audience to listen to it." -Arsenic! -No! -Yes! -No! Armida! Armida! No, Professor, nothing's going on! Ghosts don't exist, we invented them. We are the ghosts, Professor! Eduardo entrusted to Questi fantasmi the fears, the bad conscience, the problems that human beings are no longer able to face. In an interview he said, "We are the ghosts, made so by a society that wants us to be ambiguous, to be torn apart, to be both lying and truthful, generous and cowardly." Do you know which is the most famous character from Eduardo's plays? -Which one? -Filumena Marturano. Isn't it strange? After all, a play with a woman protagonist became so famous, when he used to play and write characters for himself. But all of Eduardo's plays always feature wonderful female roles. Look here, too: "Actors with the Pope. Eduardo and Titina with their company privately received by the Pope in the Vatican library. During the audience, Titina recites the prayer to the Virgin from the play Filumena Marturano." As I walked, I found myself in my alley, in front of the altar of the Virgin of the Roses. What am I going to do? You know everything, you know why I've sinned. What shall I do? Answer me! "Children are children!" I froze. I stayed still. Maybe if I'd turned around I would have seen and understood where that voice was coming from. A few photos remain of Titina's extraordinary performance, as well as the movie made in 1951. Titina had a heart condition and soon had to retire from the stage. The television production starred Regina Bianchi. Do you know when you cry? When you know good, but you can't have it. But Filumena Marturano doesn't know good and when you only know evil, you don't cry. Titina was the one who brought the comedy to success, she was the first performer and I know how much she suffered, poor thing. After the liberation, immediately after Napoli milionaria!, it was 1945-46, we all had high hopes, we were all enthusiastic about doing better, about facing a new life with new laws and, in my opinion, Filumena had to be a direct message to the rulers. Metaphorically speaking, Filumena is the people. It is the people who demand something after years of suffering. SKETCHES BY RAIMONDA GAETANI Filumena Marturano made its debut in 1946: its theme is illegitimate children. Filumena is a former prostitute who, by pretending to be ill, gets the wealthy Domenico Soriano to marry her after she stood by his side for 25 years without his feeling any connection or duty towards her. I have three children, Dummì. It's unavoidable to think back to his family history, to think that Filumena Marturano getting out of bed and saying: "Dummì, now we are husband and wife," now you have married me and you are my husband, I am your wife, getting out of bed as if she'd risen from the dead, was a sort of vindication for his shy and weak mother. One of them is your son. The front rows were always occupied by all these old former prostitutes. -Whose story was similar… -Yes, it was similar… Who knows how many Filumenas and Domenico Sorianos are there. Filumena Marturano was performed during an era, in Italy, when the issues of the family, women's rights and children's rights were still far from being recognised. It astonished both left and right, because it dealt with the conflicts of everyday life without ever becoming ideological. It asked questions, made people smile, and moved them. Afterward, it was performed all over the world. Filumena, in London, was played first by Joan Plowright with her husband Laurence Olivier on stage alongside her, and then by Judy Dench. In Paris, she was played by Valentine Tessier and Francoise Fabien, and after them, by many other extraordinary actresses around the world. In the cinema version she was played by Sophia Loren. Children are children, and they are all equal. You are right, Filume', you are right. Eduardo never stopped taking sides, following an ever-changing society… AMERICANS MUST RETURN VIETNAM TO THE VIETNAMESE …or taking a stand wherever he saw hypocrisy and injustice. He did it in and out of theater in his own way. Especially in the hot 60s. I am by nature and by constitution and reasoning against all wars. But, in particular, I am against this Vietnam war, because I consider it useless, ruthless and harmful even for the Americans. But since the post-war period, his popularity was such that, despite his increasingly left-wing positions, the Christian Democrat government wanted him as a testimonial to promote the Marshalll Plan. You explained it many times, but I confess my ignorance: I never understood anything. Yes sir, yes, the Marshalll Plan! I didn't understand how it works. For example, I need a certain thing, I let Mr. Marshall know and he sends it to me. The film is a reference to one of the most famous scenes from Eduardo's plays, the coffee monologue from Questi fantasmi. Cheers, Professor! Never take from us Neapolitans our little outlet outside on the balcony… For example, Professor, I would give up everything but this little cup of coffee taken quietly out on the balcony after that half hour of sleep after lunch. You know, that little bit of repose… Between 1946 and 1948, many things happened in Eduardo's life. He had achieved success, he was famous and was paid very well. He bought a small island, Isca, off the Amalfi coast, and made it his place of retreat and writing. It was in this state of mind, more sure of himself and of the future, that he met and fell in love with Thea Prandi, who was just over 20 years old, beautiful, tall, full of joy, and one of the voices of the Trio Primavera, at the time a very successful singing group from Turin. Here takes refuge the dreamer Who can take no more of love My father also told me that, when this love story began, Eduardo, obviously when he was in Rome and not on tour, would present every evening, at the end of the play, a 50 rose bouquet to Thea in front of the audience. A romantic gesture, a beautiful gesture, perhaps a blatant gesture, so that the world would know that he was living this beautiful love story. If I could say What my heart says How happy I would be If I could tell you! And if you could feel What the heart feels You would say: "Eternally, I want to stay with you!" But can the heart write? The heart is illiterate It's like a poet who can't sing. Eduardo knew how to talk about love, and seduce. And he did it with Thea, too. Intense days of passion. Thea became pregnant almost immediately. On June 3, 1948, Eduardo became Luca's father. A year and a half later, Luisella, a little girl, was also born. Dorothy was still his legal wife. In a moving letter, she reclaimed a gesture of love towards Eduardo and his son Luca. "If he bears your name today, it is by my will. I have already thought about his moral place in the world as best I could… DOROTHY'S LETTER TO EDUARDO AUGUST 8, 1954 …and I have also thought about his material needs. For by spontaneously offering him my name and yours, I have spontaneously and automatically renounced in his favour of two-thirds of my estate as your wife." It was then that Eduardo decided to buy, for six million liras, what was left of the San Ferdinando Theater, destroyed by the bombing of Naples on September 8, 1943. He had long cherished the idea of having his own theater. A dream tied to Scarpetta and the Neapolitan tradition. The San Ferdinando Theater was a theater of working-class tradition in a working-class location. Eduardo always tried to bring to the theater an audience that was not just middle-class, but, above all, he tried to bring to the theater people who wouldn't used to going, due to economic issues or their social background. Meaning that theater had to be for everyone, which was a lesson no one in Italy understood. An intense correspondence reveals that Eduardo saw the Piccolo Teatro in Milan, which Strelher and Grassi had opened in 1947, as a model. He wanted Naples to have a gateway to Europe, too. But the reconstruction of the San Ferdinando soon became an extremely costly and almost desperate undertaking. The government subsidies he had hoped for never arrived. He probably paid then for his overly left-wing positions. The houses had to be mortgaged. Cinema, until then more or less a movie a year, became an obligatory choice to raise money. From 1951 to 1953, Eduardo made 14 films and for two years he did not appear on stage. When asked by a journalist from L'Europeo magazine about his absence, Eduardo replied, "I am rehearsing my own death." "Dear Thea, I am sending you some extra money because I thought you might need it… EDUARDO'S LETTER TO THEA NOVEMBER 20, 1950 …Forgive me if it's not much, but you know and can take into account the crowd of needs I am suffering from right now, and Christmas is approaching." Eduardo even thought about giving up theater, and it was Dorothy who once again wrote him a beautiful letter reminding him of his dreams. "When you left me three years ago, you still had many things to say to the world… DOROTHY'S LETTER TO EDUARDO JANUARY 4, 1950 …Your soul was full of beautiful things that had matured in you during the good years. You were pushing yourself confidently and boldly towards a glorious goal. Why do you want to give all this up when the battle is almost won? Before, it was a need for you to tell the things that crowded your soul. I do not understand how you now feel the need to close yourself off." I also made movies, I did it out of need, I did it because I needed the money, I did not do it for pleasure. Only theater has given me joy. Always. It gave me a connection with the audience, gave me the chance to talk, gave me the chance to change, to escape. So, for me, life went by in an instant. Journalist Indro Montanelli visited Thea and Eduardo's home for an interview, and found him hugging his children. He asked Montanelli: UNRELEASED FOOTAGE DE FILIPPO FAMILY "Who do you think these are, Indro? Kids? No, you're wrong. These are a crowd… These are a people, Indro! Because I don't have a family here, do you understand? I have a people… And I'm not selling the San Ferdinando Theater… Right, Luca? Right, Luisella?" The premiere of all premieres in the old and reborn San Ferdinando, rebuilt by Eduardo De Filippo. It was Eduardo's dream to have his own theater in Naples. The success and happiness of that evening on January 22, 1954, wiped away, at least for a while, the bitterness of those six very hard years. An unpublished letter that Elsa De Giorgi, writer, actress and friend of Eduardo, wrote to Luca has re-emerged from the archives. "You see, Luca, that night a theater had been resurrected from the rubble… ELISA DE GIORGI'S LETTER TO LUCA NOVEMBER 2, 1984 …Everything great that has been done, for which we pride ourselves on being humans, for which we even feel like children of God, has always come about because a poet wept. Thus the miracle of the San Ferdinando came about. All of Naples rejoiced and came alive for the great feast. You were up there, Luca, in a box, next to Aunt Titina. You were wearing your first society dress: long striped trousers, a little tailcoat, shiny shoes. You witnessed a great miracle yesterday, and you are the son of the man who did it." The understage is an extraordinary work of architecture and theatrical engineering, all made of wood, all mobile, with sliding hatches that allowed the scenery to move, to go up and down, to be transformed. And for those who visit the San Ferdinando Theater, it is a very moving place. This is Francesco Mercurio, it was his father Peppino who built the theater stage, 'board by board, nail by nail'. Since there was a height of almost five meters from the stage floor to the height of the auditorium, STAGEHAND my father built the whole theater by erecting 5-meter tall wooden pillars, built the stage, the curtain… Everything was technically perfect. In an old Neapolitan palace, there is a workshop that houses all the costumes worn in those years by the actors of Scarpettiana, the company that was founded at the San Ferdinando. Vincenzo Canzanella was a boy when he began working for Maria Consiglio, the seamstress of Neapolitan noblewomen who fell in love with cinema, theater, and perhaps even Eduardo. Maria Consiglio was a high-class woman TAILOR and the only one in Naples who costumed plays… She started with Eduardo. Pictures were taken, and the newspapers spread rumors of an affair between the designer and the playwright. There was some fantasy, she wanted to get married, that was the truth… But it was him too, he went along with Maria Consiglio. It was mutual, a little bit mutual. But he wasn't a womanizer, I mean, he wasn't… But he liked to charm women, he charmed everyone, even me. I was so charmed by Eduardo. Once the euphoria of the days of the reopening of the San Ferdinando had passed, Eduardo's usual problems, economic and otherwise, resumed. He was exhausted, as though he had lived many lives. His friend Vincenzo Torraca, director of the Eliseo Theater, wrote to him: "I understand you must be very tired, but if I had spent a seven-year period like yours, full of creative activity and such great worries… VINCENZO TORRACA'S LETTER TO EDUARDO AUTUMN 1956 …by now I would have either joined my elders, or be in a nursing home." I'm so confused, truly… "Come back!" That's easy… How can you do that? Virgì, shall we get married? -Yes. -Good. In the two new plays he wrote, Bene mio, core mio and Mia famiglia, he focused on the disappointments of romantic relationships. "The man of today does not understand his partner," Eduardo observed, "he expects her to be what his mother was to his father." You didn't see me, okay? You say you're waiting for Pasqualino to come back from the ER. I put on my jacket, go downstairs, pick you up and we leave for Torre del Greco. Eduardo once again put on stage the unease he saw around him, including in his relationship with Thea. And as he often did when he was struggling, he wrote to his sister: "Dear Titina, I am really tired… I want to talk to you, talk a lot. Titì, I can't talk to anyone any more. I told Thea to call you. You will see each other, talk and cry together. And I with you. Nothing is wasted in this life: suffering helps us to get through to the end." UNRELEASED FOOTAGE DE FILIPPO FAMILY Thea, in her diary, was increasingly melancholic. It seemed a century had passed since she'd written to Eduardo: "Love me as you loved me in San Lorenzo, and even more if such a thing were possible." Eduardo sought Dorothy again and confided to her his family's difficulties and misunderstandings. He was a demanding man, she knew it well: extraordinary with his children, but often absent. Theater would always come first in his life. Dodò knew this and accepted it. Thea was young, she wanted to be a mother but often found herself alone. She didn't have Dorothy's passion for theater. She and Eduardo stopped talking to each other. Despite this, in January 1956, after securing the annulment of his marriage to Dodò, at Thea's insistence, they married and regularized their children's situation. His sense of duty superseded everything. "Love is a thing That smells like a rose… FROM "GULLIVER - SULLE TRACCE DELL'AMORE" MARCH 11, 1980 …That is not a rose Guess what it is. Is it pink? But why? Pink's the color for love There's no love if it's not pink What does smell have to do with it… If it's not a rose? Eh… Because in May You take courage By smelling the scent You fall in love Only in May? Do you know why? May lasts a year For those who know For those who don't love The month does not come And without the scent, there is no love? There isn't, because love Is a strong pain That feels like something That smells like a rose." It was in the summer of 1956, alone in Isca, that an increasingly restless Eduardo met Isabella Quarantotti. Born in Abruzzo but raised in Naples, she was beautiful, restless and from a wealthy family, she was the niece of Raffaele Mattioli, a banker and patron of culture. She worked in theater, writing and translating. She arrived in Isca with a group of friends. It was the first time I had seen the island, and from a distance it looked like a queen. Eduardo, who was waiting for us there, looked like the king to this queen. So I fell in love with the king and the king fell in love with me, and, since then, we've hardly left each other. I believe that the meeting between Eduardo and my mother was a meeting between two very similar souls. In the sense that they were both forerunners of the time they were living. Angelica, who would become an actress in Eduardo's company, was Isabella's daughter by her first husband, the physicist Felice Ippolito. When she met Eduardo, Isabella was dating the poet Ronald Alexander Smith, who loved whiskey and fine cars. But Isabella was looking for something else. And Eduardo was the right match. My mother was a force of nature, she was a stubborn woman, with a great inquisitive mind… She was also very loving and funny. She was a rebel. With her, Eduardo rediscovered the complicity he had had with Dodò and relived the passion that had bound him to Thea. Isabella represented freedom because she was a very bold, very free woman for the times. Eduardo and Isabella started to see each other between tours, especially in Milan where she lived. They got to know each other better. Isabella kept a diary. "I love that deep-set face, those pensive and playful eyes… FROM ISABELLA'S DIARY JANUARY 7, 1957 …His artist's vanity, his caustic wit and his sympathy for the weaknesses of humanity." When he was far away he wrote to her: "My Isabella, wait for me, I adore you, come soon, enamel eyes. My love, my love." Finally, two years later, in the summer of 1958, they managed to spend two whole months of perfect love on the island, days that Isabella entrusted to her diary, which in part became a book. "Here space has no boundaries, especially in the late afternoon… FROM ISABELLA'S DIARY SUMMER 1958 …I turn towards him. He's so youthful, attractive, with his blue striped shirt highlighting his tan and his forehead glistening in the last rays of the sun…" "Eduardo has started to write a play, it will be called 'Sabato, domenica e lunedì'. He works non-stop from the first light of dawn until 2 o'clock in the afternoon. How he manages to sit at the table for so long and with such concentration, I really don't know. At 2 o'clock we have lunch and our life together begins…" "We have to leave, but we want to stay. Oppressed by the humid heat, surrounded by the fabulous beauty of the night. The dread of the end has taken hold of us. The end of summer. The end of happiness. 'Stay close to me, ' Eduardo says softly. I embraced him, and so we lay dreaming for a long time, even after the last candle had sizzled out." After those days in Isca, Eduardo could only clear things up with Thea, then left for a tour, often accompanied by Isabella. He came home regularly to be with his children and took them often with him to the theater. In 1959, Luca and Luisella acted together for the first time in a Scarpetta comedy recorded for Rai: Tre calzoni fortunati. F, O, F, O… "Fo"! R, T, U: "Fortu"! N, A: "Fortunà"! T, A: "Fortunatà"! M, E: "Fortunatamè"! -"Fortunatamente"! -Ah! Tensions occasionally flared up again with Thea. Eduardo wrote to her: "With a little understanding and serenity… UNRELEASED FOOTAGE DE FILIPPO FAMILY …we will impart sweetness and Christian mores to these two children, who asked no one to be brought into the world. Give me your hand… and let's go forward." The comedy that Eduardo had begun to write on the island, Sabato, domenica e lunedì premiered on November 6, 1959 at the Quirino Theater in Rome. Tennessee Williams, too, was in the audience. Eduardo's assistant back then was a young Beppe Menegatti. There was Anna Magnani, Rina Morelli, Laura Dani and Edwige Feuillère. DIRECTOR A vast and important audience, and it was a colossal triumph. The theater was sold out every night. For Christmas Eduardo went to the Terminillo ski resort where Thea, Luca and Luisella were on holiday and waiting for him to celebrate. Isabella instead went to Positano. On January 4, at 8:00 p.m., Eduardo was once more in his dressing room at the Quirino Theater waiting to go on stage. A woman came running in and asked urgently to speak to him. I understood that something terrible had happened, terrible, terrible, terrible. After spending a few minutes alone with this lady in his dressing room, he comes out and says to me, "Beppe, call all the actors, call all the actors!" I, of course, grab the lady and shake her, just like this, "Tell me what happened!" And she clearly said to me, "There was an accident, Luisella is gone." I had to go inside, and I still remember Pupella Maggio and Angela Pagano behind me, I said, "This terrible thing happened, and Eduardo's little girl is gone." Pupella Maggio's voice behind me, shouting a "No!" that seemed so vast, this "No!" that Pupella cried from behind me… And the curtain closed. Luisella and Luca had been left alone with their nanny on the Terminillo. Thea had gone back to Rome in the afternoon. They had skied for a long time, then Luisella had fallen and hit her head. It had seemed just a tumble, nothing serious. In the evening, however, she began to feel hot and to go blind. Luisella's death was, in Luca's account to me, and he spoke of it only once… heartbreaking. He told me that this little girl had died in his arms, that no one had understood what was happening and that she had fallen asleep, and that Luca was somehow trying to wake her up because no one understood that she had suffered a brain trauma. During the night Eduardo, accompanied by Menegatti and Francesco Mercurio, left Rome for the Terminillo. When he arrived at the hotel, he had a violent argument with Thea, then he calmed down and together they spent the night in Luisella's room. Eduardo asked Mercurio to go back to Rome. "Do me a favour and go to Rome, you and Tata, the housekeeper, fetch Luisella's Holy Communion dress." So we got the car and drove back to Rome to the house on the Appia Antica, got the dress and drove back again. Luisella was dressed in her Holy Communion dress. Before the coffin was sealed Eduardo asked to be alone with her. Menegatti attended to him from a corner. He grabbed a piece of paper, and I saw him write a letter… to Luisella, fold the letter, put it in her hands and then said to call the people back in to finish the welding. Luisella was talented, a bit like Titina. You know, Titina was very good at making collages, and other things… She was a great natural talent, this little girl. I think, for Eduardo, the loss of this creature was absolutely heart-rending. The funerals took place on the 6th of January in the San Sebastiano church, on the Appia Antica. Eduardo sat next to Peppino. "Let's go put on a show," Eduardo said, he was sitting next to me. We walked down the aisle, the sermon was preached, and the little girl's funeral took place. That was all. The funeral was a play for him. At a certain point a huge, huge, huge car arrived and… Antonio de Curtis, Totò, got out of it. He went straight to Eduardo, held out his hand… and Antonio said just one word, "Eduà." And the other said, I heard them myself, and the other… "Eduà." And he, shaking his hand, replied, "Antonio." Well, I think an entire era passed in that exchange between those two great men… "Eduà…" "Antonio…" The next day, we returned to the Quirino Theater and he performed as usual. Theater is theater. Theater is like this: there are no dead people. That's the way it is. Thea fell ill a few months later. The cancer for which she had already undergone surgery a few years earlier returned with a vengeance. This was especially dramatic for Luca. Titina wrote a letter to her brother asking him to come home to Thea and Luca. "On Sunday, Luca came to see me with his mother, TITINA'S LETTER TO EDUARDO FEBRUARY 18, 1960 Thea was very depressed and worn. She lost a lot of weight, my heart ached for her. The main cause now is the pain, I think, of feeling more and more distant from home, together with all the others which are truly tragic for her. Be good and generous as always. Be yourself, as you know to be, in certain beautiful scenes of your plays. Act as this great father character at your best. I speak of the stage of your life." UNRELEASED FOOTAGE DE FILIPPO FAMILY Eduardo moved back in with Luca and Thea, and shortly before she died on June 8, 1961, they remarried, as Thea had wished. He wanted to be left alone with Luca, and, for over a year, asked Isabella for time and understanding. I think that in that moment he had to be with his son, he had to experience his grief together with Luca. I think it was difficult for Isabella to get over that moment, but I think their relationship went beyond that. What about confusion? It goes without saying that theater must be a mirror of human life, an exact reconstruction of customs, a vibrant image of truth, a truth that must also have something prophetic about it. "Not a man who has made it, nor a great thespian: but rather an aching mirror of humanity." Grazia Livi, the journalist who met him for Epoca magazine the following year, described him thus. The years of struggle for the San Ferdinando, the disinterest of the institutions and his personal grief had sharpened even more Eduardo's sensitivity towards the troubled lives and the tensions and contradictions of society. In 1960, he turned his attention back to Naples and created the figure of Antonio Barracano, the Sindaco del Rione Sanità, which premiered in Milan two years later. Barracano, a man of honor who rules the neighbourhood with his own idea of justice, who knows how to tell apart 'honorable people' from 'nasty people'. In this ambiguous morality, where authorities never appear, lies the intuition of the tragedy of the Neapolitan kids who risk ending up in the hands of criminals. Fifty years before Gomorra, Eduardo saw far ahead. I do not know the reason for the quarrel between you and your father. There are always two bells, and I like to hear them ring together. One bell tolls only for the dead, and I am not dead, I am alive. Something happened at the beginning of the 1960s that broke the gloom of those days: a tour of Eastern Europe with the entire company. EDUARDO'S COMPANY IN MOSCOW, 1962 When Eduardo went to Russia, all his actors, who were very traditional and also strongly attached to their Neapolitan heritage, loaded entire crates of tomato, pasta, oil and all manner of things along with the set and props. Neapolitans in Moscow, just to give an idea, singing improvised tunes in front of dumbfounded Moscow hairdressers and running races. They left on March 14, 1962. Eduardo brought along Luca and Isabella, who kept a diary of that long trip. "I took Luca around, and I think that was the only help I could give Eduardo… FROM ISABELLA'S DIARY MARCH 18, 1962 …I took him to a park and we played in the snow. Luca fell down, when he got up he was all white with red cheeks, ears and nose, and sparkling eyes. Great success last night at the theater for Eduardo." We debuted first in Leningrad, St. Petersburg nowadays, and then Moscow. And we got laughs, applause, the same as in Italy! He was extraordinary, he rehearsed with us a day before, when we arrived with the play he was already prepared, he had studied, and he did his thing. Wonderful. Applause, applause in Vienna as well as in Budapest and Leningrad. Eduardo De Filippo is pleased with it, is that right don Eduardo? When people clap, I don't care if they are Russian, Italian, French, or German. For me they are an audience. Don't they? But what really impressed me was the face of the Italian ambassador, when on the fifteenth call, the sixteenth call, people started shouting up from the gallery "Viva Italia! Viva Italia!" I became a man, like him. And I have to confess, I was very moved. The serenity he had found again on his return from the tour was interrupted the following year, in December 1963, by the pain of the death of Titina, his Filumena. In one of her last letters, Titina wrote to her brother: "I learned how to act from you, my Eduardo. When you have worked alongside an actor of your stature for twenty years, TITINA'S LETTER TO EDUARDO APRIL 13, 1958 the least you can do is learn to imitate him. It's like opening a packet of golden glitter: no matter how careful you are, a little bit always sticks to your fingers." We really loved each other, we admired each other, Titina has stayed with me. Andrea! Andrea! Andrea! -Who's there? -It's me, my brother! That year, Rai broadcast the six-part play Peppino Girella, written with Isabella Quarantotti. Isabella was now back by his side and she stayed there until the end. She corrected the drafts of his new plays, kept relations with his publisher, and prepared his tours abroad. Ten years of success: London, Paris, Athens, Mexico City, Berlin, Copenhagen. The costumes and sets, including those for the new television series, were designed by Raimonda Gaetani. No, he made precise requests, but he expected me to give him original answers. With Eduardo it was a matter of getting inside the places, inside the characters and then rendering them theatrically, never in a realistic way. In the end, however, mercy! Mercy, at least, on your part! In 1973, in his last play Gli esami non finiscono mai, Eduardo became Guglielmo Speranza, telling the bitter story of a man whom life subjects to an endless series of tests and exams to which he finally decides to reply with silence. Guglielmo Speranza distances himself from his family and from society, which have become deaf to any word. During one of the performances, he became ill: it was his heart, like a wake-up call. It gave him the chance to reflect on his life. In one moment I reviewed all of my life. I must tell you the truth, I didn't find anything worth reproaching. I remember Eduardo, it was in the late '70s, I went to see him in a play and then we went to say hello to him in the dressing room, and he asked us if we could accompany him home. Eduardo felt lonely and wanted to keep talking. We went on talking for a long time, but I felt that there was also a great loneliness in him. Between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s, something that seemed strange to many happened: two of Italy's most extreme intellectuals, Pier Paolo Pasolini and Carmelo Bene, sought out Eduardo. Pasolini asked him to act in his film Porno-Teo-Kolossal. The proposal came via audio-cassette. We are in the depths of the cosmos and at the bottom, at our feet, we can see the globe. We get closer and we are in Naples. Naples seen from above with its alleyways, its little squares, its slums. Then, a small window opens on one of the crumbling walls of an alley, and from this little window peeps out Eduardo De Filippo, sleepy and ruffled. In the corridor there is another character all ruffled and hairy: he is the servant whom we know Eduardo De Filippo hired the night before. But just as he is about to close the shutters of the little window, he sees that it is almost evening, almost night, he sees the comet in the sky. The film, a long journey in the wake of the comet, which represented ideology succumbing to the reality of life, was never produced due to Pasolini's death, which deeply affected Eduardo. I can tell dead from dead and living from living. Pasolini was truly a lovely and defenseless man, he was an angelic creature, he was a creature we have lost and will never meet again as a man. But as a poet, his voice becomes even louder, and I am sure that even Pasolini's opponents will now begin to understand his message and what he wanted to tell us, which will prove to be very, very helpful. Incidentally, one of Eduardo's poems, composed to honor Pasolini's death, cost him a very harsh reaction from his audience, because he dared to compare Pasolini to Christ, and the public did not easily forgive him for this defense of Pasolini. He met with Carmelo Bene, he met with Elsa Morante, he met with Pasolini, and where he met them was the place of poetry, where one is, where one is everything. At this point in our story, we must remember that we are talking about a man who, when Pasolini dies, is 75 years old. Who, when he becomes Senator, is 81. And who, from that moment on, will lead, one of the hardest battles of his life. The battle for the kids from the slums of Naples for whom the night has never passed. And the night Must pass These 11-, 12- and 13-year-olds, who are the real victims of a society such as ours, which is lacking in respect for young people, enter a correctional facility while awaiting trial and often remain there for years and years, because, either due to the sheer volume of work or to the asthmatic mechanism of bureaucracy, trials are always delayed and postponed. Once they have turned 18 and are still awaiting trial, they are transferred to the Poggioreale prison. And once the trial has finally taken place, suppose the accused is acquitted, where do they go once they are released? Who is willing to trust and give a job to a former convict? In the Gulf of Naples, on a small island called Nisida, stands the youth detention center. Eduardo used to come here, and then Luca, and now Luisa has come to visit and to check on the theater workshop. Eduardo was among the first to make the voice of juvenile inmates heard in parliament. Eduardo knew Naples very well, he knew Naples inside out, so he knew how many areas of our city NISIDA PRISON DIRECTOR generate deviance because they generate hardship. He had issued an urgent plea: to give the city's young people a second chance. He used to say that a job, even a simple job, could be a valid second chance. And so, the dreams he had brought onto the stage he now offered to the kids of Nisida. Ladies and gentlemen, Eduardo! On September 15, 1984, Eduardo was invited to the Taormina Arte Festival. Luca and Paola went with him. We were in Taormina, Luca and I were getting ready to go to the event and at a certain point Eduardo called us and said, "Come quickly, we have to leave for Rome." So we rushed over to see what had happened. He couldn't find the picture of Luisella, his daughter. He had unpacked everything and didn't find it, so we helped him search again and found it. The story behind this picture is that it had been sitting on his bedside table ever since his daughter's death, and he wouldn't leave without it. When Eduardo died, the picture was buried with him. Being serious about theater means sacrificing your life. My children grew up and I barely noticed… Thank goodness my son grew up well. This is the greatest and most important gift I have received… from nature. Without my son, maybe I… Excuse me. I would have gone to the other world many years ago, and I owe him the rest of my life. I've never mentioned it. It came up suddenly. He worked his way up from the bottom, from the nothing, from the nothing under the frost… of my theater habits, when I'm on stage rehearsing… when I was on stage acting… It's been a lifetime of sacrifice. And frost. That's the way theater is done. That's what I did. But my heart has always trembled, every night, every first performance. And I paid for it. Even tonight my heart is beating. And it will keep on beating, even when it will stop. Eduardo died a month after that evening in Taormina, on October 31, 1984. Here we are! Here comes the ragu! Let's hope they're not overcooked. That depends on Matteo, he is the one who drained them. What do you say? Shall we make a toast? To the family? Mine is a general argument. We are the cuddly ones. Look at all this goodness! Today is a beautiful day. Like those often brought onto the stage by Eduardo's plays. Real life that keeps going on, despite everything. High five! Bravo! You were so great! Bravo! He's an actor, the new De Filippo actor!
