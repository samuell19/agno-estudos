JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: There wasplenty of work for everyone back then in World War II. Those old Mississippi woods ofours were full of pine stumps. And Leston and his men wouldblast them out to be turned into turpentine for the war. So long, Miss Jewel. You take care now. You take care. All right, Nelson, you and your boys pick up yesterday's stumpsand come and join us. Yes, sir. Come on. OK, we're done. Come on, boys, let's go. JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: Cathedraland me, we'd feed them, send them off to work. Everyday the same. My wise best friend Cathe. Midwifed all my babies. Knew me inside out. Kind of pekid this morning. You all right? I'm fine. Let's go feed the younguns. Long call for breakfast this morning. Bye, Miss Jewel. JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: My name is Jewel Hilburn. This is a story about myfamily, about something that happened to change us forever. I guess it's a story about love and letting God. Here you go again. Burton, Stop tormenting your brother. Wilman. What's the matter with you two? Every single morni-- putyour napkins in your lap. Every single morning? Every morning like Cain and Abel. Here comes little fannywith her stinky old blanket. Stop that. Stop that. You know them well. Oh, children are children. You were the same when you was little. I was not. Oh, yes. you was. I got a good memory. I got a good memory. You said so yourself. God blessed you with a good streak of mischief. Uh-uhn. Burton, give her blanket back. I haven't got it, Mama. Raylene? I'm not gonna call you no more this morning for your breakfast. I said I was coming. You know, a woman can getenough sleep in this place. Who's a woman? Burton, Wilman, y'all terrible. Y'all terrible. I know well thatchildren will be children. Mama's girl. Oh. Dear Lord, here our prayer. Give thanks for the manylessons you've bestowed told us. We ask you to bless this food for the nourishment of our bodies. Amen. Amen. All right. How was your day? Almost forgot. Almost forgot. Dear Lord, please takegood care of the new life that's within Mama. Amen. You all are kidding, right? Oh my Lord. What am I supposed totell my friends at school? Huh? Hey, y'all, guess what? My Mama's having yet another baby. Yes, you are. And you watch your tongue, young lady. Now, pass me those chops. Yes, sir. A baby? A baby? There's too many of them here already. The only baby I know is sitting right there. Burton, Wilman. Now, Annie, don't you worry. You're my baby girl. Mama's always going to behere to take care of you. You know that? Cathedral? First Corinthian, 15th Chapter, fifth verse-- "Greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with the tongue." What? The Lord put it in my mindto speak with you right now, Miss Jewel. Tell you about a hardship aboutto come down on you so hard, not you or anybody elseis gonna be ready to bear. Well, what do you mean? That child you's carrying. That child gonna be your hardship, Miss Jewel. Gonna be your test in this world. What are you talking about? The Lord tell me, he tellme to tell you, Miss Jewel. He's smiling down on you. You're scaring me, Cathedral. Cathedral, you're scaring me. What do you mean? Burton? Burton-- What's wrong, Mama? Baby's coming. You, oh, run to Cathedral's house and send her, and then go oninto the woods, get your daddy. Cathedral! Cathedral! Come quick, the baby's coming. I'm going to get Papa. Thy rod and staff they comfortstill and falls before me. Lord, have mercy. [scream] Baby breech, gotta get you to a doctor. Breathe, Miss Jewel. Breathe, Jewel. Breathe. Just breathe and pray. This baby's not gonna beborn like the rest of them. This baby breech. Leston, gotta get her to a doctor. Baby breech. Don't leave my babies without a mother. CATHEDRAL: Breathe. Hang on, sugar. Hang on. If death is what you want, take the child. Dr. Beaudry! Doctor! - Doctor! - Doctor. Dr. Beaudry? Doctor. Baby breech. Breech baby. Oh my. Nurse! - Yes? - All right. We can make it like this.Thank you. We gotta take care of her. All right, Miss Jewel, relax and don't push. Don't push. Do not push. - Cathedral!- Doctor, I'll be right back. Here we are. All right, hold it like that there. Cathedral! Don't push. Don't push. Short breaths. There we are. OK. All right. Baby's coming. I can see it. Cathedral! Don't push. Don't push. I got it. She is perfect. Just perfect as all the rest of them. You slept the whole day, you and she both. It was a mighty tough time you had. How are the children? They're fine. They sent you those. They're pretty. I made you something too. Oh, Leston. Dogwood. I picked it up on the ground, knew I could make something of it. About time you carved me something special. Well, we need a name for this baby. She has her whole life in front of her. One day's already gone. Isn't that right? That's right. How about Brenda Kay? After your big sister? Yeah. She died giving child. Brenda Kay. I like it. Brenda Kay it is. I like that. Don't you? Hello, Brenda Kay. Sh. Sh. He took my toy. You're gonna wake Brenda Kay. Oh, Mama, nothing wakes Brenda Kay. He's right. She never moves. She's sleepy all the time. JEWEL: She's probably growing. I think I should give hermy blankie to help wake up. Why, Annie, what are you doing? It's a present, so when shewakes up, she'll play with it. You're a very kind little girl. You know that? Well, she's my little sister. Thank you. Mama, Marianne's littleniece is five months old too. She rolls around like a turtle. This one likes to sleep. She hasn't given us one abad night since she was born. You should be grateful. I guess so. All babies are different. They's all diff-- Something's wrong, Leston. Even little Annie knows it. The only time she wakes up is to nurse. She can't even roll over yet. She's not nearly as far alongas the rest of them were. We'll take her to the doctor. Well I don't know. I'd like a friend of mineto take a look at Brenda Kay, Dr. Floyd Basket. He is the best baby specialist in the south. You just examined her, what's wrong with her? I'm not ducking your question,but I don't want to guess. Go ahead and guess, Doctor. No, I will not. Look, I'm a small town doctor, Mr. Hilburn, and what this little girlneeds is someone better prepared to say what's wrong. She's-- she's going to be all right, isn't she? I'm sure she will. Now, Dr. Basket was my teacher,and he's in New Orleans, but I'm sure he'll come upand see Brenda Kay as a favor if I ask him. Thank you. That will be fine. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you. Well, now, Dr. Beaudry tells me I need to have a look see at this baby. Yes, sir. Ma'am. All right, you can take her now. It's OK. That's my little girl. What I have to tell you it is not easy to hear, but necessary. Hands. Our hands tell us much. Brenda Kay's hands do, too. They tell us that we can'talways depend on nature. Sometimes, things go wrong. Brenda Kay is a Mongolian idiot. What do you mean? Means she is mentally and physically retarded. She'll never progressed muchbeyond where she is right now. Flat, broad hands, smallertoes, drastically curved in. Eyes slanting upwards. Extreme case. And so it's-- it's very hardfor me to tell you this. She is unlikely to live past two years. It was a difficult birth. She's a breech baby. That's why her face looks like this. That's why she's not right. That's right. No, Mrs. Hilburn. Yes. One thing we know about this condition, is that it's present at conception. I have to tell you thatthe best thing you can do is give her up to an institution. She'll be a huge burdenon you, and you have four other children to consider. Institution? An institution will know how to care for her and tend to her. That's not right. You're-- you're wrong. Goodbye, Doctor. She's gonna be-- she's gonna be fine, Sugar. No. Dr. Beaudry can reach me, if you need me. I fixed you some nice, hot soup, Miss Jewel. Come on now, you gotta eat something. Keep your strength. Asked the Savior to help your child. Surely carry you through. Jewel? It's Dr. Beaudry. You knew, didn't you? And you didn't have the guts to tell me. If you've come here to take away my baby, you can just head on out right now. If you want to keep thisbaby, Dr. Basket and I want you to know that we willhelp you whatever ways we can. What ways might those be? Jewel. Well, I'd like to see her every month, Dr. Basket every three months. And there are injections we cangive her, calcium gluconate, to strengthen her bones. See, one of the problemswith the Mongolian idiot-- Don't you ever say thosewords in front of me again. Don't you dare. Children of this nature have very soft bones. The shots will help, every six weeks. But these shots aren't cheap,and we're going to have to talk about how much they cost. No, we do not. We'll do whatever has to be done, Doctor. All right. Thank you, Doctor. Leston, we can beat this. We can fix it. We can. If we just love her enough. Can we? JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: Those boneinjections hurt Little Brenda Kay bad, but I was bound and determined she wasn't going to die before she was two, the way they said she would. And she didn't die. She hung on. So we paid for those shots for years. Leston had no work when the war ended, and money was really tight. Raylene left school and took a job, and the younguns sold vegetables we grew. I took in sewing, and I looked after Brenda Kay. She was slow to crawl, she didn't lift her head until she was 1 year old. Didn't walk until she was 4,and every minute of every year, I had to be there. To change her, bathe here, feed her by hand, rock her when she screamed. There was no let up. Ever. Two, three. Can you take another big step for me, baby? One, two, come on, one, two, one, two. You can't get that child todo something she can't do, Miss Jewel. She's gonna walk, and she's gonna run. I promise. Just takes a little time. Your sons been playing football on the football field for almost a year, and you ain't seen neigh one of them. Not one. Leston goes. I'm just a little tired. You wanna walk again? Look, Cathedral, you watch. Let's take a step. One. Take a step for Mama. One. JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: Whathad I done wrong to produce this different little girl? I wanted to make things right. Most of all, I wanted herto feel loved, and she did. I know. But it was five years beforeshe took her first step and said her first word. Mama. Say Mama? Brenda Kay, Mama. Mama. Mama! Mama. You did it. JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: Whenmost kids are 7-years-old, they're going into the second grade. When Brenda Kay was seven, she walked down the stairs for the first time. One at a time. OK. Burton. Good girl. You're doing it, honey. Good. Slowly. All right. My clever girl. First time. Praise be to God. You did it. Good girl. I think that calls for a celebration. How about a picnic on Saturday? Let's have chicken, friedchicken, potato salad, maybe Cathedral will makeus some of her cookies. Wow. Mama, really? Your bus is here, babies. Cathedral, I'm leaving for work. Oh, Miss Jewel, your magazine come. Good. Can I borrow one of your hairpins? On, yeah, sure, of course. This one be enough? That's great. I saved the last magazine for you. Oh, thank you. I really shouldn't get them. It's such an extravagance. Well, now, I will not have you saying anything wrong about those magazines. You taught me how to read with those. And now I'm teaching, Sepulchral, my youngest. Did you know that? Oh, Miss Jewel, I am so proud of him. He is such a good study. I think about how little I pay you. Well, now, you go on. Hard as you work? You're like to do something for yourself. If Leston and yourNelson can pick firewood, I guess I can wait tables. Just go on. Brenda Kay and me, we gonnamake her favorite oatmeal for lunch today. See you later. God bless. Leston? Hm-huh. It says here there's a specialschool for children like Brenda Kay, raises their IQ. It's like a miracle, it says. No miracles outside the Bible, Miss jewel. There's an address to write to. Oh, imagine if she could go to a place like that. Nearest thing to a miraclehas been being able to stop those bone shots last year. Of course, we'd alreadygone broke paying for them. Leston? Well, I've got no regrets. None at all. This picnic you're having on Saturday? Uh-huh? I figured we'd rent a boat andhave [inaudible] on the lake. Without no money? I got a few cents raised. Just a few. Children would like that. I thought you and me could take a ride. Just you and me, like old times. Like before we were married. I'll get some wood for the fire. Raven. OK. Say hallelujah. Holler. OK, let's go. Hallelujah, Brenda Kay. Hallelujah, rainbow. JEWEL: Hallelujah, mommy. BRENDA KAY: Hallelujah, mommy. Hallelujah, Daddy. Hallelujah. JEWEL: Hallelujah, Raylene. BRENDA KAY: Hallelujah, Raylene. Good girl. Hallelujah, Burton. Hallelujah, Burton. Hallelujah, Brenda Kay. BRENDA KAY: Hallelujah, Brenda Kay. Hallelujah, honey. It's our turn. But, Brenda Kay-- Mama, she'll be just fine with us. She has four people. Will you play with Raylene? Go on. Play hallelujah? OK. I love you. You love me. Bye bye. OK, take care. Bye, Mama. - Bye bye. - Y'all don't worry. She'll be fine. She'll be just fine. Hallelujah. Mr. Hilburn, how have you been? Why, just fine, Miss Jewel. All the better for being here with you. I don't know when we werelast on our own together. Seems like it never happens. But we're here now, out on the peaceful water. Under the peaceful willow. Yes, we are. Yes, we are. Jewel, I miss you, Jewel. Hello, Leston. [bird cry] Leston, I think we coulddo better by our family. How so? I have an idea that we oughtto think of moving from here, from Mississippi. And move to New Orleans? Driving down there everyfew weeks to see a doctor don't mean we necessarily have to move there. No. Not New Orleans, but somewhere there's an opportunity for things. What things? Oh, Oh, good care, special school for Brenda Kay, jobs too. Good jobs. Who put these big ideas into your head? No one. That magazine article. That school in California. Don't be foolish, Jewel. California? You too? What's wrong with this family? Los Angeles. Now, Pete Jackson's going with me. Bought an old pickup between us and we're almost done fixing it up. LESTON: Did your mother put you up to this? No I may have mentioned the school, but-- It was my idea. There's jobs out there, Daddy. I can do well. I know it. Send money home. What if I say no? I'm 18 years old, Daddy. I'm old enough to be in thearmy, old enough to drink. It wasn't me. I didn't know he was planning to leave. 10 men I had working for me once. I was always figured the boys would follow me into the business. But that's all gone. Times are hard for everyone, honey. I guess. But nothing's worked out the way I planned it. Nothing. It's from Burton. His cards. Annie. - Oh, would you open-- OK. Sorry, sorry. This time it's Mom and Daddy's turn. Things are just fine, love Burton. Oh, Mama, look. Oh. Oh my. Lady nice. Oh, Mama. Look at you. This is the present your brother Burton sent your Daddy allthe way from Los Angeles, California. It's a mighty fine lighter. Put some fuel inside. This is how it works, you see. Watch this. Isn't that nice? Mighty fine lighter. Your Mama is real proudof them cards from her boy. Your brother Burton is a good boy. He remembers everybody andhe lets us all know that he thinking about us all the time. Take care, don't scratch them now, Brenda Kay. Can't believe how thesechildren are just growing. Seems like just the otherday, house full of babies all over the place now. Lord, have mercy. Hold on, baby. I'm coming. I'm coming. Kay. Brenda Kay? Oh, baby. Baby. Are you all right? Does it hurt? I'm sorry. How could you? How could you? We have to look out for her all the time. Cathedral. You OK? Yes, Miss Jewel. I'm sorry, baby. Brenda Kaye is healingup nicely now, ain't she? Yeah. That Dr. Beaudry says she's going to be fine. Would you look at this dress of Annie's? I don't think she's gonna bewearing this too much longer. Oh, Brenda Kay's going to be wearing it soon. Where's she gone to now? Brenda Kay? Brenda Kay? Brenda Kay? Wilman, Brenda Kay's gone missing. Go look out back, OK? Mama, I gotta meet Charlie. You just go look. Brenda Kay! Brenda Kay. Brenda Kay. Brenda Kay? Brenda Kay! Brenda Kay. Wilman. What on earth happened to you? You're a bad girl, Brenda Kay. You know you're not supposedto just go off like that. What's the matter with you? And look at your clothes. You're all wet. You don't know, do you? Mom was just worried about you. I love you. I love you too. OK, you go on in and get your clothes dry. Go in to Cathedral. You're a good boy, Wilman. Mama, she just walked and walked. If I wasn't following her, she would have just drown in that swamp. It was scary. What's gonna become of her, Mama? Sweetheart, don't worry. If we all just love her enough,she's gonna be just fine. You're all wet. Go change your clothes and go meet your friend. Have some fun. Cathedral, guess what? I'm giving up my sewing job. I shan't need you to watchover Brenda Kay anymore. You can't get up that job, Miss Jewel. You need the money. Well, I got a letter. They have a place for Brenda Kay, that special school in California, the one for exceptional children. Exceptional, you hear that? Isn't that wonderful? You're taking your child to California? Yeah, I guess. Mr. Leston know it? Not yet. Lord is trying his best tosmile down on you, Miss Jewel. You just won't let him do that, will ya? Is that what is it? Smiling? Sure. That God smiling on you, child. Well, I think you and I have different ideas about God, Cathedral. I think you need to go backto your Bible, and read Job. God gives us all burdens. You're carrying yours like it's a cause. It ain't. It's just God's will. God's will. You think God was smiling on Brenda Kay when he led her get burned? It was His grace that keptthis house from burning down. Yeah, with you watching. You can't choose that baby, Miss Jewel. Whatever you do, whereveryou go, you can't change her. She's the way God made her. And you're just going tohave to love her that way. You know nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Leston? Are you OK? What are you doing up? What is it? The clock. My mother and stepfather gaveus that clock as a wedding gift. They're dead now. At least tell me how much you got for it. I don't want you to think-- How much? $12. So the clock, twovases, the rocking chair, and all the pickle and corn,all the boys' old things. Anything else I'm missing? My gold cross necklace. Come outside with me. You figure I can't see what thehell is going on around here? All your sales? All your stupid dreams ofgoing to sunny California? How much you got? About $73. That's more than I figured. I had it about $65. You must be holding out on me. I sold the hat that Burton gave me for $6. And not a word to me? You wanna shut me out of your life? No. Then what? You wouldn't listen. I wouldn't listen? Did you talk to me, or just to yourself? Leston, I'm sorry. You want to sell everything. Everything we own. Well, there are two things youcan't sell unless I say so. One is this lighter my boy gaveme, the other is this place. This place that I built for us. It's what you want to do, isn't it? You want to sell this place,this house, this land? Yes. I want us to give Brenda Kaya chance for a proper life. The way she is, that's our doing. We have to make her better. Well, all right, all right. You're not the only onewho's been thinking, Jewel. So I'll make a bargain with you. We'll go. I'll put this place onthe market, and we'll go. Maybe Burton is right. Maybe I will find some work in California. Leston-- But, we will come back here someday. That's my bargain with you. Now, you remember it. And this, Miss Jewel, this you will not sell. This will always be mine. Leston, thank you. Thank you. I love you. I love you too, Sugar. Before you all go out, I want to tell you that your mom and I have decided that the family is going to move to California. California? Daddy, that's wonderful. - That's great.- As soon as we possibly can. What? You're serious? That's right. How we gonna get there? Daddy. Yes, we're going to California. We're gonna go to California. California. That's right. That's great news, Mama. I know how much you want to go. Aren't you excited? I got friends, is all. I never thought of leaving here. Well, you'll make new friends. Yeah. I guess so. We'll all be happy. Oh, no, it's fine. $7,000 you asking? That's right. Yep. I'll give you $6,700 for house and land, cash. Done. All right. ANNIE: Who is that? Oh, my Lord. That's Daddy. [horn honking] Leston. I can't believe it. Well, you better believe it. Ain't no way in hell we'recrossing country in that junk heap truck of ours. Leston, what your mouth. Pardon me, ma'am, but this isa 1951 Cosmopolitan four door sedan, $1,600, at your service. That's a lot of money. You're gonna give me a hard time, Miss Jewel, or do you want to get toCalifornia in one piece or not? Hey, y'all. Hey. Hey. Daddy, who's car is that? It's ours. I just bought. It. You did not. LESTON: I did. Beautiful. Mama, Daddy, you know Gower? Gower Cross. How are you, Mrs. Hilman? Fine. Well, I hope you all are here for supper. We're only having sandwiches because we're getting ready to go to California, and-- well, you are already wearingyour California dress. Um. You're married? Yeah. Well, Raylene, I had no idea. You never said any-- Mama, you're always so busy with Brenda Kay, you got your hands full. Well, congratulations. Thank you. You and Burton justtaking over your own lives. Well, it wasn't hard, Mama. I just got lucky, I guess, Mrs. Hilburn. I must confess, I was kind ofsurprised when she said yes. I'll take good care of yourdaughter, y'all can bet. Ain't no betting about it. You take good care of her now. Yes, sir. Congratulations. Sweetheart. Thank you, Daddy. Annie, Brenda Kay, this isyour brother-in-law, Gower. Can you say hi? Hi, Annie. Hello, Brenda Kay. Oh, guy, you're fat. She didn't mean it. What are we all doing stand here? Let's go inside. Should we say goodbye to the house? Bye bye, house. Maybe we should say goodbye to Cathedral? Cathedral Mama. Yes. Let's go. [honking] We're coming. Morning, Nelson. Miss Jewel. Cathedral? Cathedral, we're leaving. I didn't want to go withoutsaying goodbye to you. Well, goodbye. Bye. Find a spot. JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: So wedrove to California, thousands of miles, day after day,through prairie and desert and blazing heat to find hope for Brenda Kay. Look out there. Hand me that ice bucket. Here you go. Can you get it? Yes. Well, looky here. Look at this. Good to see ya. Good to see ya. What is this Burt? Yeah. Right, they go for short names out here. You'll be Bill before you know it. He will not. Mama. Oh, we missed you so much. Daddy. Son. Burton, Raylene's married. Got married three before we left. No. Gower Cross from Jackson. You should seen it. Gower Cross? Gower Cross, Daddy? Why he ain't nothing but askirt chasing little weasel. You hush now, she's married to your sister. Well, that don't matter. What matters is you all made it. Where's Brenda Kay? She's sleeping in the car. Oh, my goodness, looky. JEWEL: Look how much she's grown. Oh, my goodness. Mama. Burton. Come here. Give me kissy. Oh, you guys. I missed you. My baby boy. Welcome to Los Angeles. All grown up. [phone ringing] The Institute for Children. Um, my name is Jewel Hilburn. I'd like to make an appointmentYou offered my daughter, Brenda Kay, a place at your school. Offered? Was this recently, ma'am? It was about 6 months ago. 9 months. We had to move here from Mississippi. I have a letter-- I'm sure that if you bring the child in, Mr. White will see her. Thursday, the 28th at 10:00 AM? Yes. Yes. Thank you. OK, we'll see you then. OK. Bye bye. This is it, Brenda Kay. Your school, honey. Come on. Hi. There's a new world here,and it's waiting for us. Give me a smile. I love you. I love you too. Pretty girl. OK, let's go. Excuse me. We're here to see Nathan White. We have an appointment. Mrs. Hilburn? Welcome. Good morning. I'm May, Mr. White's assistant,and this must be Brenda Kay. Cathedral Mama? Oh, no, not Cathedral. She thinks your Cathedral, our house cleaning woman in Mississippi. She's also my friend. Well, come along then, he's expecting you. Hi. Will come for a walk with me? That's it, in a nutshell, Mrs. Hilburn. We test our children, and wefind the right level for them to reach, then we teach them. Can you teach Brenda Kay? Of course. She's clearly ready for it. Enroll her as soon as you can. How much will it cost? Mama, sh. You, uh, you pay whatyou can afford, that's all. That's all? It may not be very much. Public education does absolutely nothing for these children,so I do, with my associates. I had a little brother,who was committed to a home when he was one-month-old. That's what we were told to do with Brenda Kay. It was a good place, but no one there ever understood how tokeep that little spark in him alive. He lived there till he died at the age of 21. I've never forgotten that, so here I am. Thank you, Mr. White. Thank you very much. Brenda Kay would you like to go and look at Mrs. Hamby's class? School, like Wilman and Annie. Wilman and Annie. Yes. And when they came to thecorner of Beacon Street, there was the police car with four policemen that Clanton had sent from headquarters. Well, class, we have visitors. Hi. I'm Mrs. Hilburn, and thisis Brenda Kay Hilburn. Welcome, Brenda Kay. Kay, OK. Kay. [giggle] JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: Seven years went by and suddenly it was the 60s. Brenda Kay stayed in school,and her spark stayed alive, I guess. But that miracle I'd hopefor, it didn't happen. Even Mr. Nathan White'sschool couldn't raise her IQ. She was happy enough, and Mr. White took me on as an assistant teacher. Leston went from truck drivingto being head of maintenance at a city college. Burton was married, had a baby. Annie got engaged to a policemanwho wrote her a ticket, and then asked her for a date. And Brenda Kay Hilburn, she was16-years-old, but only in body. Jimmy, you go over to the painting table. Laura, come on over. Cindy. Randy, you wanna sit over there? And where's Brenda Kay? And Dennis? Oh, Lord. Brenda Kay. Brenda Kay. Brenda Kay. Stop that, you two. Go on, go sit down. Go sit at the table. Dennis, you know we don'thold hands like that here. You wanna sit over here? Take your time with that. Dennis, you want? Brenda Kay, I made thosecookies just for you. If you don't want this cookie,I'll go ahead and have it. Thank you, Brenda Kay. Mr. White? There's something I'dlike to talk to you about. Well, go right ahead. I caught Dennis andBrenda Kay holding hands. Well, they're friends. They like each other. Yes, but they're also 16. They're bodies are changing. It makes me nervous. Well, holding hands is pretty innocent stuff. That's true, but-- But she's your daughter, and not mine. That's right. I know. But she's getting older, Jewel. You're going to have to startthinking about the future. Now, there's a couple in Santa Barbara named Larry and Nancy Tindle. They have a beautiful residential home, four or five girls all with special needs living together like a family. Brenda Kay has a family. You all keep an eye out there for Gene. He is not seeing this dress until tomorrow. Ow. Oh. Sarah, you stuck me. I'm sorry, Annie. Hey, Annie? Yeah? Gained some weight, huh? Burton. Y'all. You're never gonna lose that. Damn right, we ain't. Burt, watch your mouth. Uncle Will, what are you doing? You're ruining her picture. Yes, I am. You know, your daughter weighs a ton? I'll put her down soon. No, she's all right. Hey, Annie? Yeah? Police car just pulled up. Oh, my Lord, that's Gene, It's Gene. Annie, careful. Any word from Raylene yet, Mama Hilburn? She'll be here today, I hope. She called yesterday fromsomeplace in the desert. That's a long ride with two kids. Oh, she wouldn't miss her little sister's wedding for anything. You know, Sarah, it's eightyears since I saw here. Not your fault. She's in Mississippi, you're in California. Mama Hilburn. Hi, Gene. Your bride's in hiding. Well, she better come out tomorrow. Yeah. Gene. Mama, Gene. Yes, it's Gene. Brenda Kay, I've brought you a present. [music playing] Careful. Oh, my. Brenda Kay's got her veryown transistor radio. Take cover. You hold it that close, youwant to turn it down like this.

You You couldn't change things, Mama. I tried to make it work for years, but we fought from the beginning. He was always on the road,seeing old girlfriends, drinking heavy when he was home. Honey, I wish I'd been there for you. In the end, we had one realbig fight and he walked out. Baby. Mama, I thought thatmaybe we'd move out here. Yes? And stay with us? We'll make room. Yes. We can take our time driving. Stay a month or so. Why are we going? It's home. It used to be. Well, according to me, it'll always be home. And I want us to buy a house there. Do you want to live there? Uh-huh. Why? You joking on me, Leston. Listen, honey, we ain't getting any younger. Annie is married now. We've got no responsibilitiesexcept Brenda Kay. I want to go back there. I want to end my day sitting ona porch, fishing in the river. We can't just takeBrenda Kay out of school. Well, you're the one that teaches her her letters. You can do that anywhere. Besides she's almost finished at school. Raylene's gonna move here. Maybe she'll change her mind? Look, I got a local paperwith the real estate ads. We could live in a palacedown with what we're going to make out with this house. I've marked some. Here, take a look. You sure got a nervemaking plans for our family. Who do you think you are? I'm the one who's raised BrendaKay every day of her life. I'm the one who works at aschool for retarded children. I'm not retiring. You talking to me of nerve, Miss Jewel? Selling off our house bit by bit. Selling a clock off a wall withno one's blessing but your own? Now, I have been here 10 years for you. You railroaded me into this place, and I've stayed 10 years. Well, I've had enough. And that was our bargain. Remember? You are still my wife. OK. Mama, I hate this. I've been back for half a dayand already you're leaving. It's only for a month, honey. Well, it's not safe out therewith all the stuff going on. The freedom marches, bus rides,the Klan's stirring things up. Oh, that's not gonna touch us. We're just poor crackers looking for a bayou. Here's a nectarine. Bye, Mama. Daddy. Bye. Bye bye. Bye. Raylene and the kids willhave the house to themselves. I think that's good. She's had a rough time. You keep an eye oneverything for me, Annie. I will. Y'all be good. We will. Use this napkin, Brenda Kay. Mama, Brenda Kay is fine. Right now, it's me you're talking to. I know that, honey. To the backwoods ofMississippi, Fanny Annie. Just as long as you come back now. - You be good. - We will. Bye. Oh, it looks like the wholething's about to fall down. Uh-huh I guess nobody's lived here for a while. I wonder if the old man still owns it? I'm gonna have a look at the old barn. Brenda Kay, wanna come have alook at the old barn with me? Come on. Do what your daddy says. Oh, it's nice to see you, Nelson. Miss Jewel. Mr. Hilburn. How are you, Nelson? No complaints. Just growing older than the Lord. How you doing yourselves? Just fine.

All these years, I'vebeen planning to slap you back, but this hand of mine-- you got all your children, Miss Jewel. All of them. They all alive. Even that-- that baby girlwhat brought you such hardships and tests in this world. She's alive. Yes. But I don't know if I'll ever get the chance to teach her to read. Please, forgive me, Cathedral. Please? Wish me well. Please? The Lord wishes, wishes us all well, Miss Jewel. He does. JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: What wasgoing to happen to my baby here In Mississippi? However hard she tried, she couldn't do a thing for herself. Leston had this dream ofspending his days fishing, relaxing back in our old home, but that wasn't any good for her. And not for us either. She's asleep. I've changed my mind about moving back here. Leston? But if we stay inCalifornia, there is something we got to think about. What is that? Well, we gotta thinkabout Brenda Kay's future. She's been relying on you so much. What's going to happen if we die? Well, the children will look after her. Is that what you want? You want them looking after her when she's 20, 30, 40, and stillwith the mind of a six-year-old? What is it you want then? You want to just shut her away? Do what the doctor said? She's a Mongolian idiot,put her in an institution. Is that what you want then? Cool down. I just want you to thinkabout it, talk to Mr. White. Brenda Kay, she's like a bird with a broken wing, and you've been caring for her so long, you haven't thought that maybe she can fly. [phone ringing] Hello? Annie, what are you doing calling us here? What's the matter? Who is it? It's Annie. What? She-- what? Oh my Lord. Raylene. OK, we're going to leave here as fast as we can, and you just watch over her, OK? All right, I love you. Bye. What's wrong? Rayl-- Raylene tried to kill herself. - What? - Oh my Lord. You go help Elaine. Raylene must have been in such despair. She swallowed a bottle of pills. They found her in time, thank God. Gradually, we got her back to normal life. She had a lot of courage. I'm so sorry, Mama. Oh, no, honey. They're fine. Thanks to you and everybody. Well, that's what families are for. You seeing Dr. Lafferty today? Straight after work, and then I've got class tonight, right after college. Honey, I hope you're not doing too much. Oh, no, Mama. I'm doing great. Really truly. Raylene! Hey, Raylene, get over here. Well, go on. OK. I love you. I love you. Raylene. Raylene. She'll be back. Listen, Mama. Honey, it's a little bit too loud. Let me fix it. There. That's better. School today, Mama? No, honey, remember, Itold you we don't go anymore. You're too old. We'll just go to visit. You have trouble figuringthat out, don't you? Sweet girl. Hey, Mama, we're going to play some Frisbee. Oh, no. Brenda Kay doesn't like Frisbee, honey. What about you, Mama? Come on. It'll be fun. No. I'm gonna stay here with Brenda Kay. Oh, Mama. You go on. Have fun. Well, suit YourselfOK, who's gonna catch it? It starts just like a B,but it goes straight down. It's an R. Second letterin your name, Brenda Kay. So you can write your name. OK, let's try one. You try this one. Just let it start like couldB. Round then straight down. No, Mama. No. Yes, you almost had it. - No. - OK. OK. Let's just forget it. Hey, y'all. We brought supper, and Geneand Burton are on their way up from work. Annie made a huge lasagna,and there is salad and brownies. I promised Brenda Kayfried chicken for supper. Well, that's no problem. We'll just fox her up some fried chicken then. Honey, you just stay here and color. I'll be right back. Mama, please. Cold. Cold. OK, your sweater is on the back of your chair. Mama, can you just make sure Julie doesn't eat those crayons? She's taken to that lately. Cold. Just get your sweater. Here. Mama, she can do that herself. Can't you even look afterthe kids for two minutes without tending to Brenda Kay? She was cold. You know, all of ourlives, it's been like this. Ever since she was born,you've had no time for us, no time for Daddy. You've just been set on doing every little thing for Brenda Kay. She always comes first. It has always been, children,if we just love her enough, we can fix everything. And that's true. No, it's not. You can never fix Brenda Kay, Mama. She isn't fixable. I can't believe you're talking like this. You were a much kinderperson when you were little. When you gave your beloved blanket. Mama, we all love Brenda Kay. We love her dearly, but we loveour mom too, and we need her. We need you. Not as much as Brenda Kay does. No? What about Raylene and her kids? Brenda Kay will never be in that dark pit that Raylene's been in. Brenda Kay is my baby. Look at her. She always will be. No, Mama, she's not your baby. Brenda Kay is your 16-year-oldDown syndrome daughter, and she needs a life of her own. Don't. Don't you ever, ever-- What's going on? Nothing. Oh, damn it. LESTON: Jewel? Jewel? Jewel? It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's true. Everything she said is true. Jewel. Sweetheart, there now. there now. There now. BRENDA KAY: Mama? Listen to Brenda Kay. Listen to her. She knows I'll come running. BRENDA KAY: Mama? I always have. But I don't have to, because she's safe, and she has people all around her. It doesn't have to be me. - That's right. - No. You're right. It doesn't have to be you. Oh. Leston, what have I done to you all these years? Sweetheart. I'm sorry. You ain't done nothing thatdidn't come out of nothing. This is So hard. Jewel, you know being a parent is. you raise your child as best youcan, and then when he's grown, you end up having to let him or her go. That's true, but I never thought like that about Brenda Kay. She's different. I have known so many dedicatedparents like you who spend their entire lives lookingafter their Down syndrome child, supplying their every need, but the day always comes when the parents arethe too old or too ill, and then they suddenly disappear, and the child is devastated. Defenseless. Brenda Kay needs defenses, Jewel. And you can give her them. By letting her go. Think it more as sharing her. Letting other people in. Nice place. Real quiet. You can hear the birds. What do you see, Brenda Kay? School. No. It's a home. Let's take a look. Did you have a good trip? Yes it was a very nice drive. Come and meet Nancy. She'll be real glad you're here. Nan, the Hilburn's are here. Oh. Welcome. Welcome, Mrs. Hilburn. Hello. Mr. Hilburn. Mrs. Tindle. This is Brenda Kay. Hello, Brenda Kay Hilburn. She's shy with strangers. I've got lunch coming up. Larry, honey, why don't you goround up the rest of the girls. Yeah. Are you hungry, Brenda Kay? Good. I have to tell you, they start calling this place home pretty quickly. Of course, that justmeans they have two homes. Got any fish in a pond out there? It started out as a wading pool, but when Larry got it all finished, not one girl would dare put a toe in it. And one of them hollered outfishing, so what could he do? He stocked it with little rainbow trout. Do they eat the fish? Not a one. They just love to standout there with their rods twice a day. We even have a heck of a job getting them to eat fish sticks. RACHEL: Fishing. They heard you. Now, you've done it. No fishing yet. Line up now. Come on, girls. Thank you for lunch, Mrs. Tindle. You're welcome, Rachel. Thank you for lunch. You're welcome. Olivia. Thank you, Miss Nancy. You're welcome, Sammy. I love you, Nancy. I love you too, Sammy. How. How. Sammy, go along with Larry now, OK? Thank you for lunch. Oh, you're welcome. And all the rest of us thankyou for lunch too, Nancy. Let's go fishing, girls. Here we go. Brenda Kay? She doesn't understand. Brenda Kay? It's OK. Thanks for lunch. You're welcome, Brenda Kay. She'll be fine, Sugar. Just fine. JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: There shewas, that baby I'd carried her entire life, my hardship. My test. And the hardest test of all was to let her go, to give her a life of herown, to know she's happy. Not just when I'm with her, but when I'm not. She is happy. That's her great gift. And the gift she gives to theworld, she and all the children like her. Brenda Kay? B, Daddy, look, B. Mama, B. That's very good. Very good. We'll see you later. I'm going to take this with me. Here's someone that belongs to you. Bird. Pretty bird. Pretty bird. We're going now. And you're-- you're staying here. We'll be back on Saturday. I love you, baby. You be good now. See the Saturday. I love you, Mama. You be good. Bye bye. OK. I love you. Bye bye. Come on, girls. Want to go to play? JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: Brenda KayHilburn, my hardship, my test. And the way God smiled down on me too. [music playing]
