Burg Theatre This film doesn't tell the history of the Burg theatre. Its stage ls only the setting for a story whose theme resounds whomever actors give according to their calling: Their life devoted to art This film is gratefully dedicated to the eternally young theatre Fault I (In his study - chorus of angels) Why, here In dust, entice me with your spell, ye gentle, powerful sounds of Heaven? Peal rather there, where tender natures dwell. Your messages I hear, but faith has not been given; The dearest child of faith is miracle I venture not to soar to yonder regions whence the glad tidings hither float And yet, from childhood up familiar with the note, to life It now renews the old allegiance. Once heavenly love sent down a burning kiss upon my brow, In Sabbath silence holy; and, filled with mystic presage, chimed the church-bell slowly, And prayer dissolved me In a fervent bliss. A sweet, uncomprehended yearning drove forth my feet through woods and meadows free, and while a thousand tears were burning, I felt a word arise for me. These chants, to youth and all Its sports appealing, proclaimed the spring's rejoicing holiday; and memory holds me now, with childish feeling, back from the last, the solemn way. Sound on, ye hymns of Heaven, so sweet and mild! My tears gush forth: the earth takes back her child Being able to perform down there just once God In Heaven! I'd give my life for it So what, I'm going to Graz, the theatres there are quite good, too. Here you won't get an engagement anyway, unless you come from another famous house or have a protector. You'd better have accepted the engagement to Olmutz. Everybody running with the head through the wall, what's the use? I won't get an engagement here anyway, no no. I'll rather go to Leibmeritz, my dear I could play the big parts there Romeo, Ferdinand, and what will they offer you here? If you're lucky on Tuesday at the audition, a servant, a riding messenger. 'The horses are saddled' I only want to stand down there next to him acting next to him, learning from him. I know I'm still young, but I know my abilities. If they only gave me a chance, a chance. - Good evening, Baroness. - Ah, the Director No first night without Vienna's most beautiful woman. Have a seat This seat isn't taken. As always! A pity that your husband doesn't share his charming wife's passion for the arts. It's just a matter of different tastes He entirely understands my lack of interest in horses and the country. My compliments for the performance. Mitterer again ls ravishing. Why does he never come to your "jour"? All the other member: of the that! are always than. I always send him an invitation, but... He never goes out, Your Highness, he's an eccentric par excellence. He comes,plays,eat always alone - Interesting. - I adore him. If It wasn't so absurd, I'd wait for him at the stage entrance with a bunch of flowers. That would be of little use in you. I'll be betraying a deep secret, but" It won't be repeated? I give you my word. Every night after the performance... Vivat Mitterer! You can drive homo, I want in walk a bit. You, Baroness. Seegasse 43,please I bog your pardon, but this ls my carriage. We could quarrel about this, but what's the use? It'll be a pleasure to drive you home, Herr... Mitterer Allow me to introduce: Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. Sedlmayer, the Burg theatre's prompter I almost forgot Nepomuk, my tomcat The lady? Remains a secret. Tell the lady why you always drive In my carriage In my place Well, if I... Because we don't like... in be made a spectacle of. We don't like it. we have work to do. The theatre isn't over for me when the curtain falls. It begins at 10 o'clock in the morning, and it ends never. The solution of the riddle, Madame, I beg your pardon. You haven't disappointed me, if you're thinking of that And I have no reason any longer in... Keep your secret, I'm not interested in it as much as you were in mine. But It might embarrass you, should we meat again. But I do hope so. You Invited me In, you didn't even offer me a chair, and now you even throw me out? I didn't mean It like that You did, but I shall not take offence If you grant me a favour. Allow me to return your hospitality. Or could you be so ungallant to let me plead in vain? I don't can in play a role In society. An you modest or VIII]? And you think life has nothing to offer you? I have work to do All right, I'm leaving, I'm leaving. My uni? And you'll come when I send the Invitation? In God's name, you. Such a pushy person. She spoilt all the baked potatoes I could only save the top layer. Too tiresome, it never happened to me before. Well, I'm not accustomed to ladies' visits in the middle of the night The chamomile tea ls coming presently. Baroness Seebach? Again that mad ambitious woman Will she never leave me alone? Sedlmayer, all this was a trap, a base plot to get me into her stable of celebrities. And I've been so foolish to accept I wouldn't dream of going now Do you hear this? The bells. Real bells. Under a spring sky. Such things really exist. And, filled with mystic presage, chimed the church-bell slowly, and prayer dissolved me In a fervent bliss. A sweet, uncomprehending yearning drove me... I don't need your prompting, Sedlmayer. I can feel it A church behind which the empty stage doesn't lurk. Come if it isn't absolutely necessary, I'd rather stay outside. My "rail" has such a delicious "pull" at the moment I wouldn't want in min... - A good day, Herr Sedlmayer - God's greeting, Miss Leni! By Heaven, this child ls beautiful. A saint, Sedlmayer. "Saint" would be exaggerating a bit. She's a very nice sweat girl, but... She's the tailor's daughter, from Nussdorf. Tailor, that's what he calls himself! Tailor,if you please Look at the trouser: he made for me. Cut all wrong! But he asks 2 gulden for it I always have to pull them up at the knees, so they won't split at the seams. I am really furious about that person, he'll never see me again Never again Careful with the knee measure, Herr Schindler. Otherwise the trouser: will be too tight again. This pair of trouser: might be your good fortune. That Mug. That picture. Is that your daughter? You, that': my daughter Magdalene. Where is she now? That Miss Leni? She must be back any moment She went out to deliver something, but once a young girl starts looking at the shop displays... and?! Herr von Mitterer can trust me entirely When shall I call on you tomorrow for a fitting? Thank you, that's not necessary. I shall be coming here myself. I shall be back tomorrow. Herr von Mitterer, but that's unnecessary. It'll be an honour, Herr von Mitterer - Goodbye, Herr von Sedlmayer. - God's greetings! Very well. There she ls - Miss Leni! Let me present... Servus Yea, please. Who ls It? It's only me. Miss Leni! Look what the critic wrote about me. About you, In the mm" Yes! That is, not my name. But he meant me. Lines: "The theatre needs young talents whose youth makes up for some lack of skills." Youth I have, and skills too, but the critic doesn't know about that yet. He writes: 'Youth is irretrievable. even Mitterer was young once.' A gift from Heaven, since I have an audition the day after tomorrow. Then It has already worked. What has worked? You'll only laugh at me ll' I tall you. Did you flutter your eyes at that critic? But no. Only... I anointed a necklet to St. Anthony for you. So that It may help you. You use, mm you're laughing at me. And I'm really serious. Oh no, Miss Leni I would never laugh at you. You're sweet. Tomb“; smut. And I thank you for the necklet It'll surely bring me luck, the day after tomorrow, at the audition. Romeo and Julliet (transl. Schlegel) With love's light wings did I o'er perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what lave can do, that dares love attempt. Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me. Juliet:If they do see thee, they will murder thee. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet, And I am proof against their enmity. Juliet: I would not for the word they saw thee here I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight And but thou love ma, let them find me here. My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. Juliet: By whose direction found'st thou out this place? By love, that first did prompt me to enquire. He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes. I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far as that vast shore Baroness! What a pleasant interruption! Am I disturbing you? You never do,least of all now Thank you! Very well. Excuse me, I haven't finished yet. I said, thank you. It': enough for me. The next and How can I be of service, Baroness? I would like to ask you for a favour, Director, but you mustn't refuse. You know I could never refuse you anything. All the better. Then you'll come to my next "jour" and give it the director's blessings You're In for a surprise. I won't say anything more. Don't be hurt. I know that person, she's capable of much worse. Who Is she? - You don't know her? - No. But that's the Seebach woman. What? the famous Baroness Seebach? In whose salon all the great actor: gamer? Not all of them! We have refused every time so far. Ah, the Baroness Seebach! Sends us an Invitation, so that we won't forget. Such a pushy person. I'm not going. I should never have gone there. I see,to the tailor Well, mm you're duck with the trousers. - And you are going in pay for them. - I am? You, you are. Go in him, pay him and get it over with. At once? You. At once. Th!!!“ manned you? Engaged? Don't make me laugh Nothing. It': aver. Thank you, the next one please. Thanks for the necklet, Miss Leni, it didn't help. But all one must do is believe in it! Believe, believe, what should I believe In? In yourself, Herr Rainer, In your talent! Talent,rubbish! I need a protector, an invitation to the Baroness Seebach! But you only got this ll' you're famous. And she even interrupted me, right at the most beautiful moment I could have killed her! Don't be and, I helluva In you so much. I wish to God I could help you only a little bit If..if Thank: for everything, Miss Leni I'll sit again in the market and wait till some theatre agent comes up to me and says: 'Come along, Herr Rainer! You're a genius! The trousers, the trousers... Al if Herr Mitterer went to a tailor in Nussdorf just for his trousers. But yesterday at the flitting he was very pleased. Pleased? you fool He didn't even look at the pants, only at Leni's picture. He ordered the trousers because of the girl, and since she wasn't in again, he stayed away today just like that But he might still come. Now, at 4 o'clock? When he said he'd be here at 12? He won't come again, I'm telling you. He'll never camel But Leni shall deliver the trousers to him. On other days, father delivers himself. But he and: hi: greetings, and you're in fly on the trouser: once more, to see if it has to be altered To be altered? NO, HO. I'm content with the way It ls. That's him It must be. It's beautiful that you've come. If mother hadn't sent me, I wouldn't have dreamed of coming. So your mother sent you? She did. But I enjoyed coming here. - Very much. - You did? I am so happy that I may sit here, and talk to you. Same with me Tell me,Herr von Mitterer.. You're such a famous man, and play such great roles... Have you seen me perform? No, never. Mother doesn't allow me to go to the theatre. And I would love so much to see Romeo once. Romeo... I've played him too. You have? You must have been wonderful as Romeo. What makes you think so? Because you've become so famous. Toll me... Did you also have to struggle so much to get an engagement? Why 'also'? Because... I mean... It must be terribly hard to become as famous as you are. Why do you want to know that? I'd really like to how to go about It to become famous. But it's utterly unimportant whether I'm famous or not. I don't want in be famous, and I don't even want to think about It, the theatre, work, the parts. You don't know how happy I am that you know nothing about the theatre and that you have never seen me perform, and... That you're sitting here, here, in my room May I offer you something? Something to drink perhaps? what will you have? A raspberry soda, if I may. Raspberry soda? Sedlmayer? No, one second, I'm alone, I... I'll be back presently I need a protector... an invitation to the Baroness Seebach I need a protector... an Invitation to the Baroness Seebach Baroness Seebach invites to her 'jour' on Friday, 4th May 1898 at 5 o'clock. 'In one you forgot.' I'm desperate, but there's neither raspberry nor soda in the house. And I don't darn offer you cold chamomile ha. But no, thank you, I have in leave anyway. But do stay, It has been such a pleasure for me. No no, I've stayed far too long. Am I never in see you again? Herr von Mitterer are you free on Friday, at 5 o'clock! Friday, at 5 o'clock! Would you come and visit us,in Nussdorf? For: coffee? Or am I being too forward? Too forward? I'm coming! Thank you. There you are, Miss Leni.. Now I've gone all In vain because of those stupid trousers... I've brought the trousers. Have you...? Have you talked with Leni? Oh well. I'll have a look at than trousers, whether they've fumed out any good, so that at least something useful has come out of it Well, I don't know, they seem vary narrow to me. But I don't even have to take measure ll' you please, mm really... But I told him, you heard me... 24 cm width at the knee. No, no, he doesn't listen! How can one be so stubborn! And he calls himself a tailor, no, no, he Insists on making them so tight that one again has to pull them up, so that you won't have a mishap at a certain place, when... when smug drum. I wish he'd stop with his Goethe act and we'd have our peace again Let me tell you, Herr Mitterer, there wouldn't have come any good out of it anyway, no good at all. It would be better if you stuck to Hamlet and chamomile tea And you've told me yourself that you could be her father. Sedlmayer you're an Ignorant fool. She Invited me. Invited you? Now It': happened. Herr Josef Rainer, Vienna -Any mail? - Yes a mail to Mr Rainer Here you are. Have a nice day. Come In. Here's a letter for you. Thanks, put It than. Aren't you going to open It? It won't be anything pleasant anyway, I'm used to it Miss Leni! Pinch me so that I awake! I must be dreaming! Why, Herr Rainer? Do you know what this it? An invitation! An Invitation from the Baroness Seebach to me! But she doesn't know me. Miss Leni! Do you remember? Yesterday at the audition, and she Interrupted ma, and I thought It was all over. Nothing was over, It all began! She wants to see me and so she sent me an Invitation. Yea, Indeed. So she sent you an Invitation You see Miss Leni, your necklet did help after all That's what I told you: all you have to do is believe in it. Yea that's hue, that's how It ls In life: Sometimes you think you've no luck at all, while it's standing right next to you! All you have to do ls grab it, hold it tight! For which data ls the Invitation, when will I have to go? Friday afternoon at 5 o'clock. Friday afternoon at 5 o'clock. No, no, I won't reveal anything! Don't trouble yourselves. Baroness, I'm dying of curiosity! But wait till later, my dear colleague, or you won't be able to profit from it Secrets can only be enjoyed as long as they are kept. The eternal critic! But my surprise will have a special flavour for you In particular. Is that so? You make me curious. Pardon, one moment A new one? I've never seen him at the 'jour' before. You certainly haven't seen him at the "jour", but he isn't exactly new. Rather too old for such a beautiful woman, as a husband. Excuse me, I just wanted in speak in you for a moment OI' course, chin. But you always pick the wrong moment for a tete-a-tete You know I have my "jour" on Fridays. Friday and all the other days, my dear. With all those artists coming and going here daily, I very rarely have the pleasure of your company. - Wouldn't you like to stay? - No, I don't want to disturb. I just wanted to say farewell Why? Ara you leaving for the country already today? Unfortunately it can wait no longer. A pity that I couldn't convince you to accompany me just this once But chin, you see him Indispensable I am here Indeed. How do you do, Director. How do you do, Baroness. I've kept my promise Where's yours? Your invitation,Sir? No. 12 K.u.K. Court actor Herr Mitterer I must ask you to wait here for a moment Excuse me, one moment Why so exalted? I ask you, stay calm. - What's the matter? - Mitterer won't come. He turned us down? Not even that It': an unheard-of affront He passed his Invitation on to someone else. - To whom? - To some young man. That's the llmltl My dear Madame Baroness! Rainer. My name is Josef Rainer. I am so grateful to you that you've sent me the invitation. You can't imagine how much it means to me that you've noticed me. The other day, In the theatre, I thought everything was over. And mm... Now I'm here. Well... Now you're here. What was your name again? Rainer, Josef Rainer. Your arm, Herr Rainer. Ladies! Gentleman After all that curiosity with which you've been waiting for my surprise, each of you certainly expected that I would introduce a celebrity. But I'm asking you: would a celebrity among so many celebrities be a surprise? Bravo, bravo! I'm glad you agree with me. I didn't expect anything else. A surprise In my house could only be the non-celebrity, the not yet renowned, youth before which lies everything that you have all acquired long ago: recognition, triumph, fame. May I introduce a young actor whose talent raises the greatest hopes: Herr Josef Rainer! You'll introduce yourself, won't you? Don't get UP- Why so sceptical? You yourself wrote in your review that the theatre needed young talent You use, I read your reviews Certainly,of course, It was only the surprise. But that was just my intention. I had no Idea that you knew him. But Director I wouldn't presume to anticipate your judgement Let me present the gentleman myself. The Burg Theatre's Director, the New Vienna Journal's critic. - Have a seat - Thank you. I guess I'm superfluous mm In this circle. But who ll he? I've no Idea. And you're turning him into a a sensation? Why not, my dear? 'Any port In a storm'. You know, Baroness, that was a stroke of genius. Celebrities all the time, that becomes stale. Herr Court Singer, was that Intended as a compliment? But so that It won't become stale, because I'm afraid that the Interest In non-famous people can't be sustained for long, come with me, please. Ladies and Gentlemen! Our esteemed Court Singer cannot be restrained any longer. But don't worry, this time he won't sing the "Waffenschmied" but a Viennese song. Say "servus" quietly when saying farewell # not "lebwohl", not "adieu" # those words only hurt. # But the little word "servus" # ls a last dear greeting when having to part I Your In, your out than': new wine, # and new love affairs. A really nice young man, your protégé. SO talented. I hope so. You know, I have a confession to make. I really thought your surprise would be Mitterer himself. Mitterer? I never even thought about him. # there's no music for ever, no happiness for ever, # that's life. # And that's why eternal love cannot exist. # For everything there's the final station, # you simply change your mistress # just as you change your favourite music each season. # Say "servus" quietly when saying farewell, # not "lebwohl" not adieu, # those words only hurt. # But the little word "servus" # ls a last dear greeting when having to part # year In, year out, there's new wine # and new love affairs #Say "servus" quietly when saying farewell, # and even though there won't be a reunion: # it was so beautiful once. Tell me,Herr von Mitterer I'd like to know vary much whether an actor could be really In love. Be really In lave? I mean, ll' an actor embraces someone on the stage and In life, Is that the same? The same? No. The one thing means nothing, and the char mm must be heaven. He lava you, doesn't love you, lava you... But that': not him It goal It's like this: he loves you - from his heart- with suffering - a “the - or manta“. He lava me - from hi: heart... With suffering... a “the - or manta“. Herr Mitterer! Its high time, at 8 o'clock "Faust" begins! He loves me fom his heart - with suffering... - Already? with suffering or nothing - Cheers, Miss Leni! - Cheers, Herr Rainer! -Happy? -Yes So am I,infinitely so. When your heart ls full with joy, you cannot stay alone. One needs someone to share It with, who understands one. I thought only about you the whole afternoon # Say"servus" quietly when saying farewell... She ought to stop that sentimental tune! I'd like to hear something cheerful Don't I love this song so much. When I hear It, I'll always remember this day. What a day Es beam And tomorrow morning I'll go straight to the Burg theatre, to the director, and sign my contract And than I'll pay a call to the Baroness to thank her. Josef Rainer? Ah, yes- What does he want? He probably want in thank you, for yesterday. My Interest In the young man doesn't go so far as to allow him to Invade my home now. After all, you're under some sort of obligation to him. Charming Very well, and him In. Let's finish this once and for all. And ll' It takes too long you'll announce that the carriage ls walling. I'm engaged! My congratulations! By the way, good morning I beg your pardon a thousand times, Baroness. But I'm so happy, I have a part, Don Canon. Carlos himself? That was fast. Well, not exactly Carlos but the officer of the guard. That's nice, too. For a beginning, at the Burg theatre, it's splendid! Well... ls there anything else I can do for you? You've done so much for me already that I don't know how to thank you. Don't cause me any trouble or scandal. That's all. Hem Thank you. Well,please have a seat I'll makes me proud to speak to you, Baroness. You won't have bestowed your favour upon an unworthy person, believe me. Don't be so ardent, young man. What is your line of roles? Youthful heroes and lovers. Youthful heroes and lovers, I see. You, pardon me. But I still can't quite realize what's happening to me. It's like a miracle. I've hoped and prayed for so long for it to happen, till I lost all faith And than you came along, Baroness. You believed In me. I owe everything to you. You're wonderful, Baroness. How old are you, anyway? 23 yearn. 23? You. But didn't you say yourself that I had everything before ma? That was the most beautiful thing, Baroness. I'll never forget that And I used in hate you so much. You hated me? When you entered the theatre and interrupted me, at my audition, just during Romeo's most beautiful love scene, at the passage where I'm best "with love's light wings" - Do you have a moment? - You, but... With love's light wings did I o'er perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what lave can do, that dares love attempt. Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me. Then Juliet: if they do see thee, they will murder thee. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet, And I am proof against their enmity. Then Juliet... Ono moment All right, let me have it Thank you. There's the passage. I would not want for all to see you I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight And but thou love ma, let them find me here. My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. By whose direction found'st thou out this place? The love, that first did prompt me to enquire. He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes. I am no pilot yet, wert thou as far As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea, I would adventure for such merchandise. Fain would I dwell on form fain,fain deny what I have spoke but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? Is the young man still with the Baroness? - I think so. - He's still here? Then go In and announce that the carriage ls walling. Romeo. Beloved. I beg your pardon. The carriage ls walling. Thank you. That's all. A pm]. We never been berm.

I'm afraid of nothing Nothing but your love's limits. Let obstacles rise between us, huge as mountains. I will look upon them as a ladder by which to fly into the arms of my Louisa The tempest of opposing fate shall but fan the flame of my affection. Dangers will only serve to make Louisa yet more charming Then speak no more of terrors, my love! Trust thyself to me! I will throw myself between thee and fate, for thee receive each wound...

It's embarrassing that I have to come to you, while you have other worries I beg your pardon, but I don't quite understand, Baroness. I don't understand It myself. I'm surprised myself, I never would have thought that... But you know how people are, they talk and talk, and drag every beautiful feeling into the dirt. My husband has a suspicion. A suspicion? What does he suspect'? You and me. Us'? What ls there that he mustn't know? That you've helped me, that I'm grateful in you? Grateful? I use, of course, that': It. What also should It be? Nothing has happened, nothing at all. But you see, people are like that Once they lay on your knees before ma, then the door opened, and already... But Baroness, that was only Romeo! You, you. Romeo. So much the better. I don't want to keep you. Café Dobner is waiting, and Herr Sedlmayer. - May I accompany you? - No, no. - Thank you, you just go. - Klan the hand. I would like to speak to Herr Rainer. Herr Rainer ls not at home. Can I take a message? Where ls Herr Rainer now? I don't know where Herr Rainer spends his time nowadays. He used to be in the Café Dobner at this hour. Cafe Dobner Well, you're not a great artist at playing piquet. If you play Ferdinand as badly as this game, you won't get good reviews. There's the Queen of Hearts. Trump it, if you can. Just be patient, Herr Sedlmayer. I'll learn It yet. That's stupid. But not like that You can't play that card! One pays, the other pockets. Again an eavesdropper. We'll play our next game at my house. I don't like It when somebody looks Into my cards. Do you approve of the card I just dealt? He's got a thick skin, he won't move away. “That's there to think about? That's my trick! It's impossible! Something like this has never happened to me before. How can you play ll' somebody keeps looking Into your cards? What? You have a King of Clubs and don't play it? - But I do What do you mean, clubs ls trump! And the ace has already been played. This ls so mean. Such an ignorant amateur, can't play at all and wins! Over. I won't play any more. I can't play if somebody keeps looking into my cards So him much do you got? Nothing, I'll give you nothing at all now! I don't have any money with me. I didn't know I was going to lose. But I can give you a chance to get even, Herr Sedlmayer. A chance in get even? For me? Al you wish. I can lose with dignity. I'll get the money back somehow, next time. Nut Maw Today somebody has marred It for me. Have a nice day. If you want, I'll play another game with you. Seebach. - Rainer. - I know. You're in deal. Wave... 7 clubs. What do you want from me? I want in play card: with you. The quieter the better. Nervous? I said 7 clubs. Tara good You've visited my wife daily during my absence. And 14 kings. - Yes, but... - No but Fine - Fine! - Fine, then. Even if that is all there was to it, It ls enough for me. You compromised my wife. No scene, ll' you please. And 60. Play. Wrong! That's my trick. I wish to avoid any scandal. - I don't have... - Be quiet. Listen to me carefully ll' you dare once more to come near my wife, if you have the insolence once more to enter my house, I'll throw you down the stairs, you lout! You'll give me satisfaction for this. You want a duel? That's funny. But you're lucky, I don't duel with a common comedian. Just because of your wife, only because of your wife I let you insult me here. What do you know at all? You've cheated! What's the matter, gentlemen? Who cheated? Let me see than cards. But you didn't want a scandal - He added a King of Heart. - Where did he hide it? In his sleeve probably. And of course they will say: 'those actors! A card-sharper in the Café Dobner What were the mks? Say something! A nice scandal. Scandal In Actor's Café. A well-known café on the Getreldemarkt has been the setting of an interesting affair between a young actor of the K.u.K Court Burg theatre, Herr R., and a well-known member of Viennese society, Baron S. It was only about a game of piquet!? But even if the young Herr R. could acquit himself of the suspicion of cheating at cards, even more interesting aspects on the background of this case might be revealed But it isn't true! I only kept quiet to avoid a scandal which... I don't want to know why you kept quiet, Herr Rainer. It's your private affair, and shall remain so. But this, this scrap of paper it speaks out loud And It speak: against you. All Vienna talks about what the gutter press write. Had van; mm; for you, but as a director, I am responsible for the house's dignity and cannot talents that a member... You must understand me. I thank you, Director. I know what I have to do Announce me to the Baron! But it isn't true All this isn't true! Yes I know. It was my fault. How could It come in that? To such a scene, which could have such unpleasant consequences. I lot my rage got hold of me. It's not my style to let my feelings run wild, but... Strange that this embarrassing situation forces me to confess something to you, a confession suitable for a more pleasant occasion. You must know, I lave you. Herr Rainer wants to see the Baron. You, I'm coming. He's walling In the small salon. Baht have Mn ma. I'm bother at this. Please sit down. Well... It has all turned out different than we expected. You... and I. You have suffered a wrong. Both of us have suffered a wrong, and you took It upon yourself. Baroness, I... I know. You did It for me. Of course you could have demanded satisfaction, rehabilitation, anything. My husband bears all the blame. He insulted you, provoked a scandal, and you saved him from It. Him, and myself. By remaining silent. You behaved wonderfully, you ware a gentleman. And mm you're playing such a bad part In the ayes of the wand, but not in mine Baroness, you misunderstand me! Your husband... I understand you But now you must try to understand my husband. Because he, too, did It for me. Ho... lava me. And I'm his wife Our marriage, our name In society, all this was in danger of being dragged into the dirt My husband has asked me to thank you for this, that you kept your composure when he lost his for a moment I understand... Baroness. Then you have it What's the matter, mother? What the matter ls? He's given us notice, that Herr Rainer. Written on a place of paper, with pencil, so that I can't even read it. And a boy brought it, because he doesn't dare come himself, the gentleman. We were good enough to feed him when he was penniless, he made you sew the buttons on his trousers, and now I'm to take the rent out of his savings box, and to send his few belongings to Graz, to his mother. He won't come back at all? Now you're surprised, aren't you? He didn't even any farewell in you. If you start to cry, you'll get a slap! That I have given birth to such an utterly stupid girl! You could have become the wife of a K.u.K. Court Burg Theatre actor. - Stop that nonsense - You shut up! Whit I know, I know. She could have become Frau K.u.K. Court Burg Theatre actor and she only made a heel I wreck my brains to get you a husband. It': no wonder ll' you become an old mild. You don't want that one, the other one doesn't want you. Shop that snivelling! I'm not crying. I haven't thought of him for a long time now I hope sol Jesus! - God's greetings! - Herr von Sedlmayer Such a rare guest! Just now my Leni told me what a pity it ls that Herr von Mitterer hasn't come to see us for such a long time But you mustn't cry because of it, we've been talking a lot about you. And your can must have been ringing from It. Frau Schindler, Herr Schindler, I want to speak with you in private. Leni, run across the street and bring a mug of beer! Or would you prefer wine? Take it easy, don't go into any trouble because of me I'd prefer some wine. But of course, have a seat, Herr von Sedlmayer. What's It all about? Well, Frau Schindler, you're a clever woman. Did you notice something? My God, Herr von Sedlmayer, why are you being so mysterious? What should I have noticed? Ah, go away. You must have noticed that Herr Mitterer liked to come here a lot and not because of the trousers. They don't fit anyway, mine burst.. Well, that just as an aside. The reason why he came here is Miss Leni I admit, she's an honourable, decent girl On that point I haven't been able to answer anything back to Herr Mitterer. And Herr Mitterer, we don't have to mention it,it's obvious, even ll' he isn't a young man any more. But most men at his age are much older than he ls, and... Anyway, he's at!“ a man who (an make a woman vow happy. I'm here on his behalf to ask you whether... What am I saying, not ask, just a formality... The whole affair is sheer luck for the girl, for Leni, it's an honour. I hereby acquit myself of my charge and ask you In the name of the Court actor Mitterer for your daughter Leni's hand in marriage. The Court actor want in many my daughter? You. And if Miss Leni consents, then Herr Mitterer sends her this ring as an engagement present Jesus, Maria and Josef, all diamonds! Look Leni, what the... What's the matter with you? Something terrible has happened to Herr Rainer! There's been a scandal... It can't be possible What's written here isn't possible! Father, Herr Rainer isn't a card-sharper! What's the matter again with this Herr Rainer? Let me speak, mother! All this can't be true! Whore I: that place of paper? Dear Frau Schindler, I'll vacate my room Send my things to my mother In Graz... . money for the rant" 'I'm not coming back. Thank you for everything. Give my love to Leni, she has always been good to me. Do you realize what this means! Are you blind? He'll harm himself! I know him, I can feel it! I felt that something was wrong. But child, what must Herr Sedlmayer think.. I don't care, everyone may hear it, I'll shout it to everyone Herr Sedlmayer! You know him, Josef Rainer. Tomorrow he ls to play Ferdinand. Do you helluva him in be a uni-sharper? Help him, please! Tell me what I shall do Where is he? He will harm himself, I must go to him He mustn't God In Heaven, he mustn't I lave him so much. Linen, don't cry, Min Leni, and... He won't harm himself. For he has to perform tonight In Canon. Go, dear Marquis, give this bosom peace, and bring back slumber to my sleepless pillow. Sedlmayer, where have you been? Sedlmayer? Do you hear me? I do Why do you keep me walling? What look did she show when you bold her? What did she say? I mean... what should such a young girl say? She was vary upset, and she... Sedlmayer, are you concealing something? - She didn't refuse, I hope? - No. no. She didn't refuse. Tell me one thing, did she keep the ring? The ring? The ring? She did? She did. She kept it. She kept it That's all I wanted to know. Announce me to Herr von Mitterer To Herr Mitterer? Yes,to Herr Mitterer! Tell him, Miss Schindler must see him at once. Leni Schindler. Very well, but you'll have in wall. If you would come with ma, Miss Schindler. Herr Mitterer will see you now Please go In. Excuse me, I wanted to see Herr von Mitterer But my child, don't you recognize me? Look at me. It': me. Come close It's only a costume, a mask. A bit of make-up, false hair, but all this will be over by tomorrow. Herr von Mitterer But don't look at me In this strange fashion. SR drum. . mean. Like this. You see, this is how it looks like,, the theatre. Till now, I've lived here and I've believed that this was life But It only looks like something. Now you're sitting here, and it's all nothing. Herr von Mitterer you've told me once that you were my friend, a friend whom I could mm in when I'm utterly lost. I did. A young actor ls engaged here, don't believe anything they say about him. Something terrible has happened to him, and I can't go to him, they won't let ma, and he won't listen to me anyway. Who am I? I am nothing to him. But he would listen to you, you're the only one of whom he always spoke highly, whom he admires so much. He wanted to become such a great actor as you are, and he has so much talent He's still so young, 23 years He'll harm himself ll' you don't help him now Help? Him? But what? How to help? It's all my fault that It has come to this. I got him the Invitation to the Baroness. Don't be angry, I stole it from you that afternoon I made a men of everything, and now he needs me and I cannot help him. Nobody can help him, concept you. I beg you, Herr von Mitterer, I beg you Who? Who Is this... gentleman? Rainer ls his name, Josef Rainer. He play: the officer of the guard tonight, and he's to play Ferdinand tomorrow. No, no. What Is he to you? No, dent Don't cry. Don't cry! Be quit. I'll talk in him, to this Herr... Rainer. Thank you. Thank you! Hurry up, please, it's high time! Miss Leni? Miss Leni! Herr Sedlmayer, into the box, the last act is about to begin If you please, may I wait here? Sure, sit down over there. What! Will no one make reply? Each aye upon the ground, each face covered! My sentence ls pronounced. My sentence ls pronounced. My sentence ls pronounced. I read It here proclaimed In all this lifeless, mute demeanour. This is rebellion! Hark. Rebellion! Fly,sire! They are in revolt! Rebellion! Where is the king? Madrid's in arms! To thousands swelled, the soldiery and people surround the palace and reports are spread that Carlos ls a prisoner - that his life is threatened. And the mob demand to see him living, or Madrid will be in flames. Defend the king Stands my throne still firm? Am I sovereign yet aver this empire? No! I'm king no more. These coward: weep - moved by a puny boy. They only wait for the signal to desert me. There! Fling yourselves down there before him - the blooming, the young king; I am nothing mm but a defenceless old man! Hasn't Mitterer been marvellous again? Again, my dear? I found him convincing for the first time in years! This time he even played with his heart in it, and feeling. Has Miss... Has Miss Leni been here? Did she, I mean... What did she any? What she said? That she lava me, she said. That I'm everything to her. The only man in the whole wide world who could make her happy. For whom she had been walling. You utter fool! You fool! All right, where is this.. Where is the garde-robe of this Herr... Rainer? It's on our side, up on the fourth floor, the last door. NO. No, no. I cant I can't do It. What also? I am 1:0 talk 1:0 him? To him I am to talk? Perhaps I am to throw him into her arms, too? What also I: demanded of me? I mean... - Perhaps he'll harm himself. - No, he won't! At 23 years one doesn't harm oneself! I'm more than twice his age, and I don't harm myself. And I don't know why, either. Good evening. You, wait, I'll be with you In a minute. Role: Ferdinand Hans J.

And when I get those crazy notions once in a while, than all you have to tall me ls: 'Look, I do helluva In you.' That'll help me. You've always believed In me, and you've always helped me. And, filled with mystic presage, chimed the church-bell slowly, And prayer dissolved me In a fervent bliss. A sweet, uncomprehended yearning drove forth my feet through woods and meadows free, And while a thousand tears were burning, I felt a wand arise for me. These chants, to youth and all Its sports appealing, proclaimed the spring's rejoicing holiday; And memory holds me now with childish feeling, back from the last, the solemn way. Sound on, ye hymns of Heaven, so sweet and mild! My tears gush forth: the earth takes back her child Sound on, ye hymns of Heaven, so sweet and mild!
