Mr. l.C. Porett, remember now, tomorrow we're coming through... Dolphin pen and all. Ain't no need to push none. The boy and the dolphin will be gone by then. Fact is, they'll be gone this afternoon. It has to be done. Look, it can't be put off no more. Jump, flipper. Jump! Come on. Once more. Come on, take me to the dock. Thank you, flipper, but bananas aren't for dolphins. They're for people, and you're not a people. Sandy! Coming, Mr. porett. Hi, Mr. porett. Come on down and see flipper. Why, I haven't time now, son. Come on to the house. I have to talk to you right away. Yes, sir. Drop anchor, star. I still don't understand. How come I have to leave here? Sandy, all of this... it's always been state property. And now they're coming through here with a new causeway, starting tomorrow. There just ain't room no more. I got to talk to my pa. You can't. I tried to reach him. He's still up at the park ranger school. Well, what about flipper? What's gonna become of flipper? Well, flipper, you don't have to worry about him none at all. Why, he's gonna get the best care by the best people in the whole world when it comes to dolphins... The Miami seaquarium. Well, they're coming down to get him in an hour. To get him? You mean, to take him away? But nobody can take flipper. I won't let anybody take flipper. Look, there ain't no place else for him. What, with your pa still gone and your ma passed away, God rest her. You have to go up to madisonville and stay with your aunt.. Mr. porett, flipper has to go where I go. Sandy, there's no more water in madisonville than you can get from a well. Now, you know flipper can't live in no bucket.. Mr. porett, please... Sandy! I'll be back in a half hour to help you get ready. I'm sorry, son. I thought I raised you real good. I did the best I know how. Yes, sir. The best I know how. Watch your helm, star. Engines ahead full. Nobody's going to take you, flipper. Nobody. You wait right here. "Dear pa..." "please don't worry about me. "I'm going far away where no one can find flipper and me." "but just remember, I'll always love you and be thinking of you." "your son, Sandy." "to my pa." "private." Yes, Porter ricks... R-i-c-k-s. He's one of them student rangers at the diving school. Hello, po? I been trying to get you for three days. Listen, is Sandy up there with you? 'Cause if he is, I want you to put the front of your hand on the back of that boy's britches! No, Sandy isn't here with me. Why should he be? He has what? Well, po, the first day, I thought he'd come home when he got good and hungry, and then I started really looking. The boy ain't around nowhere, po... and flipper's gone, too.. Mr. l.C. Porett... you must've been using a soap bubble for a skull. I'm coming down on the first plane. And when I get there, I want a boat, and I want it ready to go. Mom still says you can have the boat as long as you want it, po, but she'd kind of like to know how long you'll need it. How long? Till I find Sandy, that's how long! Till I search every little bay and cove up and down the Florida coastline! Anywhere a boy might try to hide with a dolphin. Well, you don't need to worry none about him going out into the open ocean! Why not? Well, see, about the time Sandy disappeared, the coast guard was searching every inch of that water out there, using planes and everything, looking for three escaped convicts. Gil bateson, you heard of him, and two other murderers. Gil bateson? For a while they thought they'd headed out in a boat. If Sandy had been out there, they'd have spotted him right off. I know. I checked first thing. It's a big ocean. But Sandy wouldn't go out there in just a skiff. Even you couldn't have made him that desperate. Po! Wait! I've been saving this for you... flipper's horn. Sandy went off without it. It might help you find him. Thanks, Mr. l.C. Porett. Sorry I was so angry with you. I know, you were only trying to do well. That's the lord's truth, po. It sure is. Help me out, will you? Sorry, flipper. That's empty. That was the last can of food, too.. I guess I'm in trouble. Bad trouble. Flipper, I don't care what happens or what you say. I'm not turning back now. Thanks, flipper. Guess I'm not that hungry yet. Sam! Sam! Sam! Dang-blast it! You're getting too old to hear anything! Arrggh! Huh? There's a castaway out there. I'm changing my course to pick him up. Oh, no. Flipper! Flipper, it's gaining. You've got to help me. Sam! Sam! Sam! What? Speed her up, Sam! O.K. Sam! I think you got to speed her up! He's pulling away! All right. He's pulling away! Faster, Sam! Faster! 20 years you've been working on that engine! It can't even catch up with one puny boy in one puny skiff! Well, do something! Forget it, Sam. I said, forget it. Whoever he is, he don't need any help from us. We need help from him. O.K., flipper. We're o.K. Now. All right, flipper. You can rest now. Don't worry. We'll make it. Flipper! Flipper, it's just perfect. Everything we could want. Nobody anywhere! They'll never find us here. Flipper, I wouldn't trade you for anything. ♪ Doo doo ♪ ♪ Doo doo-doo ♪ ♪ Doo doo doo-doo ♪ ♪ Doo doo-doo ♪ ♪ Doo doo-doo ♪ ♪ Doo doo doo-doo ♪ ♪ I don't care ♪ ♪ If the skies are cloudy ♪ ♪ Long as you're with me ♪ ♪ It's a fine and dandy ♪ ♪ Cotton candy world ♪ ♪ I see many times ♪ ♪ When I'm feelin' lonely ♪ ♪ You come into view ♪ ♪ It's a fine and dandy ♪ ♪ Cotton candy world ♪ ♪ With you ♪ ♪ You're the prize ♪ ♪ I won ♪ ♪ You're the apple on the stick ♪ ♪ Doo-doo doo doo ♪ ♪ You're the one I had to pick ♪ ♪ You made my heart ♪ ♪ Go tickety tickety tick ♪ ♪ Tick-tick tickety tickety tick ♪ ♪ Every day is a day of wonder ♪ ♪ Never ever blue ♪ ♪ It's a fine and dandy ♪ ♪ Cotton candy ♪ ♪ Fine and dandy ♪ ♪ Cotton candy world ♪ ♪ With ♪ ♪ You ♪ ♪ Doo doo-doo ♪ ♪ Doo doo-doo ♪ ♪ Doo doo-doo ♪ ♪ Doo doo-doo ♪ ♪ Doo doo-doo ♪ Quiet, flipper. A plane. I've got to hide. An underwater cave. We couldn't have a better hiding place. Flipper, this is great! Go up and take a look, flipper. Hey, get the boat out. Come on. This may be the best break we've had since we ran that cabin cruiser up on the rocks. What'll we do now? Act like castaways, see if we can hitch a ride! The boat's leaking again! Stuff the rags in tighter. O.K., flipper? Mummy, daddy, there's a little boat over there with some sick men in it. Could be those convicts they've been searching for. Well, if it is, they're half dead. We'd better take a look. Go below and get my gun, will you, Julia? That's the three. They fit the descriptions perfectly. Better get on the radio. Can one of you give me a line? I wouldn't do that, friend. Drop your gun on the bottom of the boat. All right. Now move! Just what we need to take us where we want to go. Probably not enough food for people we don't need, so, uh, we're going to make a little swap. You're going to take our boat, and we're going to take yours. All right. We'd better do as he says. Wait a minute. We may need you to run this boat. You stay. Yeah, but they can't handle that... all right, lady. It's all yours. Oh! All right, lady. Get in the boat! All right. Let's get this clunk inside. Come on, children. We'd better start rowing. Help them, flipper. Tow them if you can. A sea monster! No, it's a dolphin! Well, never mind it. Try to row. But it's attacking us! I know. I saw her try to hit you. I don't blame you. Oh! I'm getting blisters, mummy. Oh, well, uh... well, wrap those rags around your hands. Oh! Oh, mummy, look! Quickly! Put them back together! Oh, quickly! Quickly, honey! I can't! Try! Try! Row! Row as quick as you can. Quickly. Oh! Oh, my babies! Quickly! Oh! Oh! Won't be long now. Hurry! I can't! Oh! A ring, look. Here. Hold on. Hold on now. Hang onto it. Hang onto the ring. Gwen! Are you all right? Penny, are you all right? Yes! Thanks to this. Where did you get it from? It must have been in the boat all along. Oh, mummy, what are we going to do now? No food... no water. Nothing. Marooned here. What will happen to daddy? It'll be all right. Somehow, it'll be all right. Good work, flipper, but I guess we both better get out of sight before they start looking around. See ya later. Morning, flipper. I'm going down to see how our visitors are doing. Follow me down the beach. Penny! Come down at once before you fall down and break something! Oh, but, mummy, we're all so hungry. We've got to reach those coconuts. Well, maybe we could cut the tree down. There must be millions of things we can find in there to eat. Well, yes, there are, but there are also millions of things that are very poisonous and none of us knows which is which. I'm sorry, but I can't run the risk of your getting ill here. We'll just have to catch fish or look for turtle eggs or something like that. But how, mummy? I don't know. We can try. I'd like to help them, flipper, but they just can't know I'm here. Now, penny, you try to fish, and, Gwen, look along the beach over there. See if you can find something. Sometimes things are washed up. I'll look over there among the trees. That's a super idea, mummy. Take this to her, flipper. And be sure she doesn't see you. Flying fish! Take this to her, flipper, and stay out of sight. Mummy! Mummy! But, mummy, they must be flying fish. They flew right up at me. Penny, they're not flying fish. They're a fish called grunion. At a certain time of the year when the moon is right, they swim up on the beach. Well, I don't see any moon! Children, I don't care what kind of fish they are. I'm just glad we have them. See? I told you Providence would take care of us. Can't I try it, mummy? Oh, penny, you'll only get in the way. I'll just go on a bit longer. Flipper, they just can't do anything right. Come on. I'm going to need you again. Oh, I'm sorry. All I'm getting is blisters. Well, we'll just have to eat this fish raw. Oh, no! Gwen, in the far east, millions of people eat it every day. With a little lemon juice, it's quite good. But we don't have any lemons. Well, we must eat! It's that monster. Well, never mind. It won't come on land. Come on. We must eat. Mummy, matches! Dry ones! I swear they weren't there 10 minutes ago! They must have been washed up from some ship. You see? Every time we need something, somehow we get it. It's just like I told you. It's Providence watching over us. Well, let's hope that providence is looking after daddy, too. Thanks, flipper, again. All that trouble so they can have just one good meal. Flipper, we've got problems. Who are you? Look... please... forget I'm here. I'm hiding out. I... hiding out? I'm... I'm a fugitive. I mean... you're part of that gang that took my father! No! No! Look! I'm a friend! I'm not one of them! Honest! Look, I've been trying to help you. That's how you got the fish and the matches and that life ring when your boat sank. Flipper brought them to you. He's my friend. He's your friend, too. See? He's bringing you a present. Thank you, uh... flipper. Gosh. Then why did you say you were a fugitive hiding out? Well, I didn't really mean... I haven't got time to tell you now. But the important thing is, you've got to promise not to tell anyone I'm here, not even your mother. All right. I promise. It's got to be an oath, a blood oath. A blood oath? That way I can really trust you. Then I'll help you all I can. Well, all right.. I swear I won't tell anything about Sandy ricks or flipper. I swear I won't tell anything about Sandy ricks... that's me. Or flippah. His name is flipper. But that's what I said. Flippah. Why do you talk so funny? I talk funny? Flip-per! Flip-per. Where did you learn to talk like that? England. That's where I live. Penny! Oh, penny! Go ahead. Answer. Coming! Be right there! Look, whenever you hear this whistle... Try and get away and meet me. Say, you fight pretty good. You were lucky. You should see me when I've had enough to eat. How about that, flipper? Flippah? We'll save these matches no matter what happens, and we'll take turns watching the bay. The minute you see or hear anything, a plane, a boat, anything, this signal fire's to be lit instantly. Right, mummy. It's our only chance to get help for daddy. I'll take the first watch. Maybe just you and I should stand watch, mummy. I think we can rely on penny, too. You know how penny is. She daydreams. Maybe Gwen is right, mummy. I'll see if I can have some more luck fishing. All right. Look, I'd better come with you. Not bad for a daydreamer. Gwen, why don't you take these back to mummy? All clear? It's o.K. o.K. Now meet me where I told you. See how easy it is when you know what you're doing? Now, what did I tell you about tinder? Only use the inside bark of the tree because it doesn't get any rain, so it's always dry, real dry. Now, another thing you should know right away is how to climb a coconut tree, also, how to husk coconuts. My pa showed me how they do it in the South seas. It's not hard, even for a girl. Come on. No, no. You get sweeter milk from the green coconuts. O.K. That's pretty good. I know, "for a girl." please, Gwen, you only get in the way! And that's the way you come down... almost the same way as you go up. I remembered it all from a movie I saw about the South seas, uh, mutiny on the bounty. . Well, I saw mutiny on the bounty, . And I don't remember that. And that's how I remembered how to make a fire by rubbing sticks together. It all came back to me when I was sitting over there fishing and daydreaming. You want to try it? I'll show you how. Oh, my weak ankles, you know. Well, maybe you'd like to husk those coconuts. Hit them hard against the point of that rock the way I showed you. Oh, well, uh, maybe penny ought to do it. Well, she seems to know so much more about it. Penny got the coconuts. I think it's her turn to rest now. I see no reason, Gwen, why you shouldn't do it. You know, this is a magic island. It's just full of miracles. ♪ Imagine that you see ♪ ♪ A hand of magic ♪ ♪ Paint the trees and the streams ♪ ♪ It's like walking into a lovely ♪ ♪ land of dreams ♪ ♪ Well, take my hand ♪ ♪ Come with me ♪ ♪ There's such ♪ ♪ A wondrous world to see ♪ ♪ Imagine ♪ ♪ That you see ♪ ♪ A rainbow painted ♪ ♪ Right in front ♪ ♪ Of your eyes ♪ ♪ Like a million flowers were dancing ♪ ♪ 'Cross the skies ♪ ♪ Well, take my hand ♪ ♪ And you will see ♪ ♪ If you imagine long enough ♪ ♪ If you imagine strong enough ♪ ♪ This wondrous world ♪ ♪ Belongs to you and me ♪ ♪ Just imagine ♪ ♪ And you'll ♪ ♪ See ♪ This tree can be most useful of all. It's the palmetto. Inside the top here, there's something real good to eat called swamp cabbage. I never knew there was so much we could eat right under our noses. That's where most people do eat... right under their noses? See these leaves? Once you learn how to weave them, you can make almost anything. Stick with me, because right now, I'm going to teach you how to weave a fish trap. You're pretty good at it. It's not hard. Penny! What on earth have you got there? It's a fish trap. I made it by weaving palmetto. It's easy. Now, I know I didn't see anything like that in mutiny on the bounty. . Uh, no. This was in, um, showdown in Samoa. . Well... well, if you ask me, mummy, it looks a pretty ridiculous contraption. Shall we just try it out? Yes! Why not? I think it's been down long enough. Well, come and help, Gwen! It's remarkable. It's nothing, really. You just don't see the right films. Well... come on. Let's get it back. Showdown in Samoa? . Hey... you know who this guy is? I've just been going through his papers. Sir halsey hopewell. Or, excuse me, uh... the sir halsey hopewell. . One of the world's great airplane builders and designers. Worth $10 million. Honored by six governments. Yeah, we got ourselves a real prize here. I got myself some prize new ideas. Yeah. Feed him to the fishes. Save some food. We don't need him around here anymore. Oh, yes, we do. We're changing course right now. We're going to turn around and go right back to that island. Besides, he ain't eating very much. All right, Mr. sir. They mustn't! They mustn't bring anybody here. Flipper! Stop them! Look, mummy, there it is! Oh, mummy! What? What happened? Why would it do a thing like that? See what I brought you? How dare you send flipper to put out our signal fire?! How dare you?! I'm sorry, but I had to. I just can't risk having any strangers come to this island who might find out about flipper and me. Flipper and you? That's how it is. Do you realize you may have cost us our only chance to help our father! Our only chance to get word to somebody! Not what happened to us, what happened to him! Oh, you... you... I'm sorry about that, too, but... gosh. You've got to understand... all right, I will keep my blood oath because I have to! But don't you ever try to help us again! Or even speak to me! I got your message to meet you, po. What's up? Mr. porett, these charts of mine, now one of them's missing. Did you take it? No, po. Which one's missing? The chart of the Bahamas and the west indies. I had it. It's gone now. Po, you don't think the boy headed out that way, do you? I don't know. There's a coast guard station in Puerto rico that covers that entire area. That's where I'm going now. Hi, flipper. Want me to come with you? Penny, why won't you look at the fish trap? Why are you being so stubborn? Because I know there won't be anything in it. When the wind is this high, the water's too full of plankety. Plankton. And that's when fish just won't go into fish traps. But at least you could have a look. It might not be so windy over there. And there might be some lobster again. I'm tired of nothing but bananas and coconuts. Oh, I'll go and have a look. Yes, Gwen, do. I'll come with you. No. All right. I'll do it. We'll all go. Ooh, mummy, it's really heavy. Cans? Cans of food. And a flashlight. And it works. And a can-opener. A can-opener? That's what it is, look, a can-opener. Oh, mummy, this place is haunted. Penny... do you know anything about this? Well, I... Look. It's that dolphin. Ooh, that creature. It must have put those cans in there. With a can-opener? Ooh, let's get away from it. It might do anything. But a can-opener! Hi. Did you like those things I put in the fish trap? There's lots more. I don't want to talk to you. I found a sunken boat. It's just loaded with things that you and your sister and mother could use. Well, you just keep them. Thank you. We don't need anything from you anymore. Gee whiz. I know I made a mistake. I'm trying to make up for it. I even put my flashlight in so you could signal at night if you saw a plane or heard a boat. I'm trying to help you. We don't need your help anymore. Thank you. Daddy's back for us. It's daddy! Oh. Mummy, mummy, quick! It's daddy. Look! Look! Yeah, flipper, I know. Her father's back, and we'd better get out of sight just in case she does tell. Mummy! Oh, look! Come on, look. There he is. Be right back. It's those convicts. Run, mummy, run! No. No. We'll be with daddy no matter what happens. O.K., ladies, get in the boat. Daddy! Daddy! Are you all right? Yes. Are you? Yes, all right. Darling. All right, all right, lady. Sit down over there. Get on the radio, friend. Mayday, mayday, mayday. This is wg9026. Sir halsey hopewell on the penn Julia. I can only send this message once. Please tape record if you can. I will wait 10 seconds. My wife, my two daughters, and I are being held as hostage by gil bateson. He and his... Associates want a guarantee of immunity and safe conduct to wherever they wish to go. If they do not get this within one hour, they will kill me... and my family. Do not... I repeat... do not conduct any search activities. Stay away. I repeat... stay away, or they will kill us all. And I mean it. I'm very sorry, sir. But all search activities have been suspended throughout that entire area. But why? I can't tell you that. Well, then for how long? At least 24 hours. Perhaps longer. My boy may be still floating out there somewhere in an open skiff, half dead. Don't you understand? I think I do, Mr. ricks. I'm the father of a boy myself. If you'd like to sit down, relax, and wait... wait? I'll hire my own search plane. No. I'm sorry. We can't let you do that either. We have our reasons. We also have reason to believe that the situation may improve very quickly. Let's both hope so. Sir. Excuse me. Hey, gil. Want some more food on board? There's a bunch of cans drifting in there. It looks like they popped up from that cabin cruiser we sunk. Well, we got a few more mouths to feed... don't know for how long. Better go and get them. It was a shark. I saw it. It was... this long. Gone. Just like that. All right, all right. Get back there. I'm tired of looking at them. Get 'em in that cockpit, tie them up and keep them tied. Hey, gil. Look at that. How about a little target practice? Save your ammo. You never know when you may need it. Only take one bullet. Save it, I told you. What do you suppose would make a fish act that way? Got some kind of loco weed in the water or something? Sandy. Shh. Turn around. I'll cut you loose.. I got one. The other 2 are forward. Thanks, son. Mummy! Halt! Unh! Darling, I want you to handle the boat. Look out! Flipper. Quick. Flipper. Stop them. Twist it. Sandy, you were wonderful. Oh. Thank you. Mum, dad, Gwen, this is Sandy. He's been helping us all along. Only you didn't know it. Sandy, I don't know how you did it. I don't know how to thank you either. Don't thank me. Thank flipper. Wasn't for flipper, I wouldn't have been able to do anything. But who's flipper? Flipper. Flipper? He's been hurt. Coast guard radio, San Juan, this is wg9026. Sir halsey hopewell on the penn Julia. . Over. Wg9026, this is coast guard radio, San Juan. Over. Need urgent assistance. We have found your three convicts. We also need someone who can help with an injured dolphin. Over. Did you say an injured dolphin? That is correct, an injured dolphin. Stand by one. I'll give you our exact position. We'll help you, flipper. We'll help you somehow. Flipper, it'll be all right. Flipper, please stop moving. Pa, if flipper lives, he won't have to stay here, will he? No, son. My park ranger commission's come through. The coral key marine preserve... that's where we're gonna be living from now on. And there'll be plenty of room for flipper. He's got to save flipper. He's just got to. Well, if anybody can, it's Dr. Burton. That's it. Let's see what happens. If flipper swims now, he's going to be all right. He's swimming. He's going to be all right. He's going to be great. Flipper, you're wonderful. Captioning made possible by Warner bros.
