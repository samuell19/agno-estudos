[TENSE MUSIC] [COMPUTER CHIRPING] [COMPUTER KEYS CLACKING] [TECHNICIAN] So you'll be disoriented at first. - Just try and land on your feet. - Okay. Now, once you're through, find the lab. The technician there will give you a ride to town. And things will be different? That's what you paid for. [TECHNICIAN SIGHS] [EXHALES] [TECHNICIAN GROANS] [MICROWAVE BEEPS] [KEYBOARD CLICKING] [ELECTRICITY SIZZLES] Okay. [EXHALES DEEPLY] - [SWITCH CLICKS] - [MACHINE WARBLES] [HANDLE CLANKS] [TECHNICIAN GRUNTS] [MACHINES WHIRRING] [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [AIR WHOOSHES FORCEFULLY] [METAL CLANGING] [ENGINE REVVING] [SIGHS] It's time for a new shirt. What's wrong with this shirt? It looks like a zombie Halloween costume. I was wearing this shirt when we met. And every day since then by the looks of it. Sometimes a little change can be a good thing. Babe, I have bad news for you. What's your bad news, babe? - I plan to be buried in this shirt. - Oh. - Yeah. - Well, then you better hope I die first. - Doesn't matter, it's in my will. - Oh, yeah? - There's nothing you can do. - Mm-hmm. Yeah? I have a top-notch estate planner. - Oh, you do? - I haven't told you about that? - No. - His name's Wilfred. Shut up. - You shut up. - You shut up. - You shut up. - Shut up. [LAUGHS] [JAZZY PIANO MUSIC] [CROWD CHATTERING] - [WOMAN] You haven't told him yet? - No. What are you waiting for? - He's not going to like it. - Just tell him. Maybe he'll surprise you. Are we talking about the same Todd? I mean. - Hey, babe. - Mm. - Hey, babe. - Hey, babe. - Dave wanted to show you something. Did he find you? - Uh-oh, what? Probably a porno mag or a really cool bug. - He's not that bad. - No offense, but your brother is an overgrown man-child. Todd! [LAUGHS] Check this out, man. [TODD] I mean, it is impressive. Is it, though? [DAVE GURGLES] [DAVE LAUGHS AND COUGHS] Hey. Hey. Let's go to that new bar that they've got, they got the, they got "Ghostbusters" pinball. - Man, that's a classic. - Dude, it's late. Dude, it's not late, it's nine o'clock. When was the last time we hung out? I feel like I haven't seen Lucy in like a week. Lucy, tell you boyfriend to stop being such an ass badger. Todd, stop being such an ass badger. You know about my... it's a condition. I can't help it. - What about you, Annie? Playing pinball? - My name is Abby. And you're an idiot. And that's a no? - [DAVE] Oh, fuck, it was Abby, it was Abby. - Are you all right to drive? - Yeah, I'm fine, of course I'm fine, yes. - Say the alphabet backwards. - He can't say it forwards. - All right, so touch your nose. - I'm fine. - Touch your nose. - I'm... - Touch your nose! Touch your nose. Okay. - Touched. - All right, all right. Just be safe. Of course I'm going to be safe, always. What about you? - Last chance for boys' night. - Another time. All right, well, don't be a stranger. Go to bed! So... There's an opening at work. - Mm-hmm. - It's the VP of marketing, and my boss says the job is mine if I want it. That's amazing. It's in the Seattle office. Seattle, Washington? I want to go. Well, that's going to be a hell of a commute, babe, but I mean, if you're committed I bet you could just, you know, take... And I want you to come with me. You're being serious right now? Mm-hmm. I've never even been to Seattle. Well, you've never really been anywhere outside of New England. That's my point. Mine, too. [TODD SCOFFS] What? What are you thinking? I don't want to move. I like it here. I like the way things are. [SIGHS] Why are you making that face? - What? - I knew you would do this. Do what? Cop that bullshit resistant attitude - you have all of the time. - What? - You didn't even think about it. - What do you want me to say? You want me to be excited by the fact that my girlfriend is taking a job across the country without even talking to me about it? Fine, well, I'll pack my bags tonight. Let's leave tonight if that's what you want to do. Yeah, forget it. Just forget I asked. What are you doing? Are you sleeping me out? Lucy. Lucy. And I'm like, "That's like, it would be a really long commute" to go from Providence to Seattle." And then all of a sudden, she's like, "Well, yeah, I'm taking it." And I'm like, "what are you talking about?" How could you take a job 3,000 miles away without talkin' to me about it? Hey, man, it sucks, okay. But I told you, she does this. She does this all the time. She doesn't stay put. She's a restless spirit, or whatever the hell you want to... [DAVE SHOUTS] [DAVE GROANS LOUDLY] - You son of a bitch! - I'm trying... - I'm asking for your help here. - How? How, are you watching this? I need your help, I have no... I don't know what to do. [TODD SIGHS HEAVILY] - What? - Ever since the two of you got together, I've noticed a very steep decline in us hanging out. What's with that, man? Like, oh, you come by in the middle of the night. You want to complain about my sister. Yeah, that's awesome. That's real fun, man. We used to do things, man. When was the last time we went fishing? - Never. - I rest my case. [VIDEO GAME BEEPING] You want to go fishing? Is that what you want? Yeah. All right, man, we'll go fishing. Good, I'm free Sunday. [SCOFFS] All right, dude. Thanks for your help. No problem, buddy. Sunday, right? We're going to do this on Sunday? I need a yes. [TODD] Yes. [DAVE SCREAMING] [DAVE GROANS] No! [SOFT EERIE MUSIC] [ENGINE REVVING] [TODD SIGHS] [DOOR SLAMMING] Luce? Lucy? Shit. [KNOCKING] [LIGHT TENSE MUSIC] Hey, Todd. Stop it! Who are you? I'm you. [LAUGHS] You're me? Well, you're me. [SCOFFS] But. But... But, [SCOFFS] but. You're me. I'm you. A slightly thinner you. Wait, what? Look, Todd, I have a problem. And I need your help. [TODD SCOFFS] Wait. Wait, how is this possible? [TODD LAUGHS] It doesn't matter. It'll all make sense soon. Okay. This is fuckin' weird. What's your problem? You. [CLATTERING] - [BODY THUDDING] - [TODD YELPS] [SKILLET CLANGS] [TENSE PIANO MUSIC] [KNOCKING] [COMPUTER CHIRPING] [TODD EXHALES DEEPLY] [CELLPHONE RINGING] [CELLPHONE BUZZING] Hello? Lucy, hi. I miss you. Been like eight hours. No, I know. We should probably talk when I get home. I'd like that. Really? More than anything. I love you. I love you, too. - [LEVER CLUNKS] - [MACHINES BLIPPING] [HANDLE SQUEALING] [FIST POUNDING] [FAINT CLASSICAL MUSIC ON RADIO] [SWITCH CLICKS] [MACHINES WHIRRING] [LOUD CLASSICAL MUSIC] [HANDLE CLANKS] [COMPUTER BEEPS] [AIR WHOOSHES FORCEFULLY] [AIR WHOOSHING] [TODD GROANS] [EERIE PIANO MUSIC] [TODD GROANS] [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC] - What happened to you? - Uh... I'm not sure exactly. I remember talking to myself, which, that can't be right. You need to go to a hospital or? No, no, I just need to get home. Where's home? Providence. All right, hop in, guy. Thank you. It's not too far, I don't think. It's this one up here on the right. Yeah, thanks. Thanks again for the ride. [DRIVER] Yeah, get that head checked out. [DOOR RATTLES] Lucy. Lucy, I'm locked out. Yes? What are you doing in my house? - Your house? - Well, yeah, it's... - [DOOR THUDS] - [LOCK CLICKS] - Hey! - [FIST POUNDING] Hey! What the fuck is happening? [DOORBELL DINGING] Dave, thank God. You got to help me. [PANTING] [SIGHS] Dave, come on. Something's goin' on here, man. I talked to myself. Dave, I know it sounds crazy, but there's another me. And now I don't live where I live, and you have a, you have a mustache. Why do you have a mustache? Dave, Dave, come on, man. I need your help. Dave. Thank you. What'd you do to your head? - [TODD] What? - What did you do to your head? [PANTING] [STAMMERS] I think he hit me. - Who hit you? - The other me, the other Todd. Something's goin' on here, man, and I need your help. Thank you. - Ow, ow. - [DAVE] Stop moving. Ow, I'm moving because you're poking it. Yeah, well, I'm poking it because you're moving. You know what? Do it yourself. I don't know why you didn't just go to the hospital. Because I came here. Why am I getting the sense that you don't want me here? - Really? - Really. Todd, I'm not going to rehash the past with you. Rehash what? You are not making any sense. You haven't made any sense since I got here. - I'm not making sense? - Yes. I'm the one that's not making sense. Yes. [SIGHS] Maybe you should just go. Are you serious? You're serious. Fine. Just let me call Lucy. Now, how do you intend to do that? With a phone, Dave. A phone would work great. - Why are you doin' this? - Doin' what? - Todd. - Dave. - She's gone. - She's gone? What? [SCOFFS] - What do you mean she's gone? She left for Seattle already? - [DOOR OPENS] - What are you talking about? - We just talked about it. She wouldn't have just left for Seattle. Abby. What? Who's the kid? [TODD GASPS] He's talkin' crazy. He said he wanted to call Lucy. He thinks she's in Seattle. Well, obviously he's having some kind of a mental break. He needs help. Abby, I have done everything I could for him. - He needs to see a doctor. - I agree with you. Is there a 24-hour mental institution I can bring him to? Lucy would want us to. Oh, that is... that is so not fair. [BABY COOS] - What are you doing? - I need today's newspaper. - Why? - Because I think I've traveled through time. No, no, you have not. - Well, then explain to me what's goin' on. - You hit your head. I hit my head, and now you have a baby? Where's my baby, Dave? [ROMANTIC JAZZY MUSIC] Hi. - Hi. - It's so good to see you. Yeah, I don't want to pretend like nothing happened. Neither do I. I see that you're mad. And I get it. You do? Yes. Yes, I get it. You were right. Oh, you were right. You were right. About what? Hmm? [LUCY] Right about what? Everything. You were right about everything. Being? Wait, just, I need to be more supportive, - you know, and... - No, that's not really the point. No, no, no, listen. I'm not being very eloquent. I am committed to you, 100 percent. To us, to being together. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to be with you. All right, so what about all the stuff you said last night? I wasn't myself last night is the truth. So you'll come with me? Of course I'll go with you. Yeah? I'd go anywhere for you. Anywhere? You have no idea. - Come here. - What are we doing? I don't know, I'm trying to hold you and dance with you. So we're going to Seattle. Yes, Seattle. Yeah? Perfect, love Seattle. [TODD] How many times do I have to tell this story? Just one more time. [SIGHS] And then other me hit me with a frying pan. - [DOCTOR] Okay. - And now Dave has a baby and a mustache. [DOCTOR] Mm-hmm. - I'm not crazy. - You have a mild concussion. A little confusion is totally normal. This goes well beyond confusion. Well, someone's going to need to watch him over the next 24 hours. Can't I just have him committed? [DOCTOR] No. Look, Dave, I'm not making this up, man. Dave, stop, listen. I'm not making this up. There's something' wrong here. - I agree with you. - I don't know what's goin' on, but there's something. Something' isn't right. I need your help here. - Okay. - All right. So let me just use your phone, and call Lucy - and find out what's goin' on. - You can't call her. Why not? Because she's dead. Shut up, dude. - Three years, Todd. - Stop it. - It's not funny. - I know it's not funny. We've known each other a long time, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, so we should be able to tell when one of us is being serious? Yeah. Lucy has been dead for two years. I just saw her. Look, I get it, you've got head trauma from whatever. And you're still coping. I'm not coping! Right, sure, right. I need you to listen to me, okay? Just... listen to me. There is no other you. Lucy's not in Seattle. She's gone. Okay? You've asked me for my help, and I'm going to do whatever I can, but... But just consider the possible that you might be wrong. [GENTLE PIANO MUSIC] That's it. This isn't right. I know. [TODD LAUGHS] Let's get you home. Are you coming or what? [TODD SNIFFLES SOFTLY] - [TODD SIGHS] - Are you crying? [CRYING] Would that be weird? No. Awake already? Still. What about you? I always wake up right before the baby. So? What's the deal? You crazy or what? She's not supposed to be dead. I know that feeling. [SIGHS] Why don't you... why don't you tell me what happened? I want to know what happened. All right. You guys fought. She went to go talk to Dave. Driving fast, it was dark. Ran off the road. You can find it on the highway. Dave was devastated. I mean, all of us were, but not like you. You couldn't let it go. And we had to, you know? Dave hated seeing you like that. We'd all just lost Lucy, didn't want to lose Todd. But you were way gone. [BABY CRYING] Right on cue. - What's her name? - Hmm? The baby, what's the baby's name? I didn't even ask. Lucy. [BABY COOING] [GENTLE MUSIC] You're never up before me. I know, couldn't wait. Mm, where's this guy been? You feel skinny. Mimosas. [KNOCKING] We're moving to Seattle. [GIGGLES] - Both of you? - That's a weird reaction. Right, uh, yeah. No, great, great. That's great. - [TODD] Babe, who is it? - It's Dave. He didn't tell me you guys were going fishing. Hey, dude, congrats. - Yeah, I didn't realize that you... - Yeah. I think I'm going to spend the day with Lucy today. - Yeah, yeah. - Sure, great, great. - [TODD] We'll see you soon. - Meet us at the tavern later to celebrate. [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC] [BABY COOING] [??] Todd? Do you want some dinner? - I don't think him staying here is such a good idea. - Take him somewhere familiar. Maybe you can snap him out of it. [SIGHS] All right, buddy. - Come on. - [TODD] No, just leave me. No, come on. Come on, we can't be on the floor. [GRUNTS] Come on. I got ya, I got ya. I'm not really in the going out mood. Neither am I, but I can't have you moping around the house making a bad example for my daughter, so. Put something else on. You look ridiculous. [TODD SIGHS] [CROWD CHATTERING] [TODD] Hey, buddy. Cheer up, man. It's a special occasion. This is supposed to be fun. Yeah, I mean, like I said, congrats, man. You don't seem too happy for me. Oh, no, of course I'm happy. Come on. Let's have a good night, all right? [LUCY] I mean, he's open, he's romantic, and now we're going on this whole new adventure together. See, I told you. You should always listen to me. It's like he's a whole new Todd. Remember that face she used to make? [DAVE LAUGHS SOFTLY] I think it was more like a... [CHUCKLES] - She like, turns her head and squints her eyes. - Kind of tightens up her lip. - That's right. You always knew if she was about to set you straight. Call that the Lucy face. I know how you feel, man. I don't think you do. Oh, I do. I could've been a better brother. I didn't appreciate her enough while she was here. All I cared about was havin' a good time. I never really knew what it was like to lose someone, you know? You wake up one morning and everything's different, like you're in some shitty parallel universe. [TENSE MUSIC] But you can't go back. We can't hold on to what things were like, you know? The sooner that you come to grips - with that... - Wait. What? What did you just say? We can't hold on to - how things used to be. - No, no, no. Before that. - Things are different now? - No, no, no, before that. Todd, I don't know, what did I say? The parallel universe thing. - Todd, that was not the point of that. - That's it. - No, Todd. - I'm in a parallel universe. Stop it. - It all makes sense now. - No. - Lucy... - Stop it. Baby, and the mustache. Don't! Stop it. - Other me, he sent me here. He stole my girlfriend. - Todd. - He stole my girlfriend. - Stop being a crazy person. Don't you understand? I'm in the wrong universe! I got to go. - So when are you guys leaving? - Two weeks. Aww. I still can't believe it. I'm going to miss you so much. They'll come back. They always come back. [GROUP LAUGHS] - We'll see. - [DAVE] Mm. Oh, we should have a toast. Right? That's appropriate. Todd, good buddy, how long we been friends? Long, right? It's been long. And Lucy, I feel like, God, I've known you your entire life. [SIGHS] I wish I could say that I approved of you guys from the beginning, but I would be lying. Todd, I think I even told you, "Don't date my little sister." - [BEARDED MAN CHUCKLES] - Not a joke. But you did. You did. And you're still doing it. [LAUGHS] [SIGHS LOUDLY] No, you guys are great. I mean, it's really hard to picture you guys apart, especially since it just never happens anymore. You know? So, hey, to Todd and Lucy. Who needs friends when ya have each other? [TODD] Excuse me. Talk to you outside for a sec? Nope. Nope. - What was that about? - Speakin' my truth, man. - This is important to her. - What about what's important to me? It's like you don't remember anything we talked about. What did we talk about? Maybe how your relationship to my sister seems to be more important than our friendship. It is, Dave. What is this? This isn't you. This is not you. Classic Dave. Always looking after your own needs. I thought you'd be different. What do you mean, "Different?" From what? What's this? This is your apartment. Maybe other me's apartment, but it's not mine. I'm going to tell you now what I told you then, okay? If you can't let her go, I can't do this anymore. She's not dead. Dave, come on. Dave. I'm sorry about your Lucy. [CAR DOOR SLAMS] Which one is it? 103. [ENGINE STARTS] [EERIE ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC] Hello? I knew it. [LUCY] I mean, if he was that upset about it, I don't know why he wouldn't just say something. Did he say something to you? - Todd? - Huh? Has Dave ever said anything about this before tonight's lovely little speech? I think he might just be upset about the fishing trip. You know, you could have gone. You didn't have to stay here. [TODD SIGHS HEAVILY] What? I don't want to get Dave in trouble. Tell me. - No, I... - Just tell me. [TODD SIGHS] Okay. This is really hard to say. Dave told me that I had to let you go if we're going to continue to be friends, is how he put it. [LAUGHS] I mean... he wouldn't say that. [TODD SIGHS HEAVILY] She's asleep. Okay. What? No. [DAVE SCOFFS] I've tried with him. You know I've tried. All right, but things are different. And he needs to learn, okay? He needs to understand and he needs to accept it. Why are you staring at me? [CHUCKLES] I'm not the problem. Yeah, fine, I wasn't there for him. But he wasn't there for me. Why do I have to be the better friend? [SCOFFS] No. You don't know what you're talkin' about. No, this isn't fair. Okay, look, I know that he came for help. And I just, I pushed him away. I get it, I know all this. I know all this, I know it. I know, I know, I know. No. Nope. Fine! [GROANS] Oh, God, you are so... - I hate when you're right. - [GENTLE MUSIC] [DAVE KISSES??] [DOOR SLAMS] [BABY CRYING FAINTLY] Hi. I miss you. I know. - Do you miss me? - I don't even know you're gone. It's strange here. I don't like it. It's not that different. Yes, it is. Dave's got a mustache, and you're dead. Well, that sucks. You know, it's funny. You were so scared about going to another state with me, and now here you are, stuck in another universe without me. - It's not funny. - It is when you think about it. I'm thinkin' about it, and it's not funny. It is funny. You want to make out? We probably shouldn't. Someone's breaking in. - What? - Hide. [HANDLE RATTLES] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [TODD] Fuck. [DOOR CREAKS] - Wait, wait, wait! - [TECHNICIAN GRUNTS] - Where is it? - Wait, where, what? - Where the fuck is it? - I don't even know what it is. My lab, you asshole. - What? - What did you do with it? Wait a minute, you're the... [TECHNICIAN GROWLS] - Where is it? - It wasn't me, it was him. It was other me. I'm going to count to three. One, two... [VASE CRASHING] [TECHNICIAN GROANS] [BODY THUDS] - [TODD COUGHS] - Who is this guy? Todd, what the hell? [TODD PANTING] What? Dave, what are you doing? - I'm calling the police. - No, no, no. I think I need this guy to get back. Just hear me out, man. Please. Other me followed him and his machine for months, just so he could take my place and send me back here. It makes perfect sense. And you know what the most fucked up thing is? - I don't. - Other me stole it just so, I don't know, so no one would follow him. [SIGHS] And now this guy wants to kill me. That was supposed to make me think you're not crazy. This guy has some sort of interdimensionary motor-home thingy. All we have do is find out where this other me, the other Todd, put it. - Dude. - I'm beggin' you here, man. Please, just consider the possibility that I might be right. You honestly believe this? Yes. I really do. [DAVE SIGHS] Okay. Okay. I mean... I guess it can't hurt to look. Thank you. - Thank you. - But if we don't find it, or if we do and it's some retired couple's vacation home, that's it, okay? We're done, and you have to accept it. Okay, all right. [SIGHS] What about him? What? We can't leave him here. [MELLOW MUSIC] What are you doing? - Keeping an eye on Todd. - So you're following him. He's acting different. Don't tell me you haven't noticed. I have. He's not himself. Yeah, he's mad you, dummy. And you know, honestly, I'm a little mad, too. Okay, so last night, that didn't really come out right. Did you tell him that he had to let me go or you wouldn't be friends with him anymore? No, I didn't say... - I didn't say exactly that. - Mm-hmm. Look, I don't want you to move either. I know better than to try to talk you out of doing anything, and I just don't want to lose Todd too. Dave, no one's dying. We're just going to be six hours away by plane. I know, that is just like you. You just come in here and you steal my friend away from me. Oh, my God, okay, that is not what's happening. Then why is he acting weird? Maybe try taking a good look at yourself for once, and stop staking out my house. No. Something's up. I need you to leave. - Dude. - Dave. - Luce. - Dave. I am so mad at you right now. - Fine. - I'm telling mom. Go ahead. [ENGINE REVVING] [??] What are you doing all the way out there? - [DAVE ON PHONE] Looking for an RV. - What RV? - Why? - [SIGHS] He says it can send him... send him back to his own universe. This is not what I had in mind when I said he needed help. Look, some stuff has happened. I don't know. What if this is true? - Dave. - I know, I know, it's just... God, God, he really believes this. I mean, come on. If I woke up one morning and you were gone, I'd want my best friend's help. Abby? Are you silently admiring what a great friend I am? Yeah, something' like that. Where to next? I don't know, it's this map. Do you think this is a road or a coffee stand? [DAVE SIGHS] [MELLOW MUSIC] Dude. [TECHNICIAN] You son of a bitch! [GROANS] Damn it. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] He looks mad. Yeah, he... yeah. Mm-hmm. - [TODD] Maybe you should talk to him. - [DAVE] No, I'm good. All right, maybe I'll talk to him. Yes, absolutely, do that. Just give me two seconds. Just hear me out. All right? What I was trying to say before was, I'm not the Todd you're lookin' for, all right? Other Todd stole your motor home, not me. This other Todd, all right? He sent me here so he could steal my girlfriend. But, well, I was a jerk to her. And I have to get back. All right? So we're looking for your lab. And once we find it, which we will, right, Dave? Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. Oh, yeah, yes, yes. Absolutely. Then maybe we could untie you. And then you could shoot me back. I wouldn't. What do you mean? Well, if you untie me, I have to kill the both of you. So I wouldn't. [DAVE SIGHS] [MELLOW PIANO MUSIC] - [ENGINE REVVING] - [LOUD JAM MUSIC] [JAZZY PIANO MUSIC] [CELLPHONE RINGING] - Hello? - Did you get my message? - No. - What about my text? - No. - I sent you an email. - Dave, what is it? - Todd didn't go to work today. He's just been walkin' around all day. [GROANS] Did you follow him after I specifically told you not to? - When have you ever known Todd to play hooky? - Shouldn't you be at work? Now he's just sittin' at this restaurant, with flowers. Luce, I think he's havin' an affair. I mean, that would explain all the... Dave, I am meeting him there. - Oh. - Okay, just go home. [LUCY ON PHONE] This is getting ridiculous. - Oh, shit. - What? Dave? Dave? Hey! - Hey! - Whoa, hey, buddy. - Why are you following me? - What? No, what? Just a coincidence. Twice in one day? Yes. Why are you following me? Something's up with you, man. You're acting different, way different. People don't just change over night. Something's up, and I'm going to figure out what it is. - [DAVE GROANS] - Stay away from me! - I'm going to figure out what's going on. - You don't understand. - [DAVE] I don't understand. - [TIRES SQUEALING] - Todd! - See, Todd wouldn't do this, - you son of a bitch. - Todd, what the hell? What are you doing? [LUCY] Dave, Dave! What is your deal? He started it. Dave? [JAZZY PIANO MUSIC] Wake up. [DAVE GROANS] [GROANS] What is this? It's a junkyard, you idiot. I thought it might be a good place to find the motor home. [CAR DOOR OPENS] [DAVE SIGHS HEAVILY] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [TECHNICIAN SIGHS] Hey, man. I got to go to the bathroom. You're kidding? - Right now? - No, not right now. If you want, I can turn the back seat into a porta potti, - and then we can go. - Nope, nope, we'll go. We'll go. [SIGHS HEAVILY] [URINE SPLASHING] [TECHNICIAN GROANS HEAVILY] So, um... is this real? [TECHNICIAN] What? Are you a parallel universe guy? I don't know what you're talkin' about. Well, that whole, the motor home and Todd and... You mean my fucking house? Your little buddy over there stole it from me, which is grand theft auto, my friend. I mean, come on, you didn't actually believe that crazy story he cooked up, did you? No. You ask me, your friend is absolutely nuts. [LUCY] Look, I am not trying to excuse his behavior, but maybe if you made the first move, you guys could bury the hatchet. - He started it. - We are leaving very soon. And I just... can't we just go back to the way things were? - I don't think that's going to be possible. - Why not? - I have a theory. - What's your theory? - You're not going to like it. - What's your theory, Dave? I don't think that's Todd. What? That's as far as I got. Oh, God, you worry me so very much. He's skipping work. He's attacking friends, me. He's moving. Lucy, he's moving. Todd has never been west of Connecticut, and that was just over the border and by accident. That is not Todd. - This was a mistake. - No, no, no, no. No, no. I have known him way longer than you have. That is not Todd, not Todd! - You can't be serious. - I am 100 percent serious. - Test him if you don't believe me. - [LUCY GROANS] - Ask him something only Todd would know. - That's crazy. - You'll see. - You're crazy. I am not crazy. [DOOR SLAMS] I'm not crazy. All right, I got a good feelin' about this. Yeah, maybe we should just call it. I just need a little more time. Todd, we've been at this all day and all night. We can't look in every literal junk pile in the state. We can, I just, I just need a little more time. - I asked him. - What? He says he has no idea what you're talking about. And you believed him? Are you serious? Todd, let's just drop him off some place. Come back home with me. You can stay with Abby and I for a while. - We'll get this all sorted out. - What? No. - Dude. - No! Get in the car. I want to show you something. [SIGHS] Fine. - Where were you? - I was at Dave's, to apologize for my boyfriend, who, quite frankly, has been acting more than a little crazy lately. [SIGHS] And you know, maybe I'm partly to blame. I know I sprung this move on you, and I was a little rigid. But you know, that is not an excuse to go full-tilt nutso on me. You're right. I am. No, I mean, you're right. I haven't been fair to Dave. You've been an asshole to Dave. I've been a huge, flaming asshole to Dave. Yeah, and now he's got all these ideas about you not being you and... Look, I don't even know what that means. Tomorrow, I'm going to go talk to him, and I'm going to set things right. Because we're leaving, and I want to leave on the right foot. - Because you're right. - Yeah, look... I appreciate everything you've been doing and how hard you've been working, but just... [SIGHS] Don't go changing completely on me, okay? You got it. - Let's go to bed. - [LUCY] Yeah. [MELLOW MUSIC] [DAVE SIGHS] I believe that this is real for you, but you have to try to face the world without her. I can't. Come on. [TODD] Holy shit. Holy shit, holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit! We found it. Holy shit. Holy shit. Dude. Get the guy. You believe me now? This is either the most elaborate prank in history of ever or you were tellin' the truth. [TODD LAUGHS] - Either way, I got to see how this turns out. [DAVE EXHALES DEEPLY] - [TECHNICIAN GROWLS] - [TODD] It wasn't fair to you. I don't know what got over me. [SIGHS] I think I was just under a lot of pressure, thinking that I'd lost Lucy. But I've come to my senses now, and I, really, I want to apologize. I wasn't treating you like a friend should treat a person. And for that, I'm sorry. Well, I probably shouldn't have been following you anyway. That is true. [CHUCKLES] Why don't we put this whole thing behind us? I think that's a good idea. Buddy. You know, for a while there, I was afraid this was going to turn out just like Montreal. Yeah, but it's all good, man. - Did you ever find your passport? - Yeah. Yeah? Where was it? It was in my bag the whole time. - [LAUGHS] No shit. - The entire time. Really? You were so mad. I know. I know. I was wrong about that, too. I've never been to Montreal. And neither have you. [TODD SIGHS] - [BOTH GROANING] - [ITEMS CLATTERING] [EERIE ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC] I want to let it go, Dave. But you just had to have it your way. The funny thing is... Is that the Dave I know would have never put up such a fuss over me. What'd you say to Lucy? [MUFFLED VOICE] I told her you're not Todd. What? I told her that you're not Todd! I told her that you're not Todd. But I am Todd. And I'm a better Todd for her than your Todd ever was. Except you're an insane person. [SIGHS] I really wish people would stop saying that. I'm not an insane person. I did this for her. I did this because I love her. What did you do with him? I think he's fine. But... the bigger problem here is, I can't have you messin' things up for me and Lucy... here. Tell her there was a misunderstanding, and that we worked it all out and nothing else. [CELLPHONE BEEPS] [DAVE] Hey, Lucy, it's Dave. Just wanted to call to tell you that, you know, Todd came by. We worked it all out. It was just a big misunderstanding. So if I don't see you before you go, you know, have a great tri... [CELLPHONE BEEPS] [DAVE'S VOICEMAIL] Hey, it's Dave, uh, Leave me a message. [CELLPHONE BEEPS] [TENSE ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC] [CELLPHONE RINGING] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] Fuck. Hey, hey, baby. - Hey, Todd. - Hi, everything's, uh, - everything's good, just a little... - [DAVE SHOUTS] - Wait, wait. - Have you heard from Dave? -Busy right now, let me, let me call you back. - All right, come on. - Hey, tut-tut, tut-tut, tut-tut. What is this? What are you doin' here? - Look, I need this guy sent out now. I have cash. - Oh, you have cash. - I haven't caught a jumper in days. - A what? You show up wanting your double gone, which is fine. I don't know your life, it's none of my business. But ever since then, I haven't had anyone come through. And personally, I think you had something' to do with it. Hey! - [METAL BANGS] - Ow! [GROANING] [WRENCH THUDS] How many times am I going to have to do this? [GRUMBLES] God damn it. - It was the other Todd. - He stole your lab. I wouldn't steal from you. I would never steal from you. Do you think I don't hear this bullshit excuse all the time? It wasn't me, it was the other me. But you've got the wrong Todd. Listen to me. It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter, because now I have to kill you. - No, you don't. - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I do. - No, no, you don't. - [TECHNICIAN SCREAMS] I don't want to argue about this, all right. Come on, outside. Blood's bad - for the machines. - You don't have to kill us. - Yes, I do. - No, listen to me. Just listen to me. - Sorry I got us into this, man. - No, it's my fault. If I had just helped you instead of telling you to move on. It's not your fault. I'm sorry, I just, I wanted to get back to Lucy. Oh, God, shut up. Who's first? - I was being selfish. - I'm the selfish one. - Ah, to hell with it, mustache! - Wait a minute, Dave has a baby! Jesus. Why'd you tell me that, hmm? Why? Now I got to think about his kid's face - while I bash his skull in. - [DAVE] Let Todd go! He's not the one you want. Guy, I'm not lettin' anybody go! The Todd that stole your lab, he's still out there. And like I told you before, I don't believe you. - So... - But what if it's true?! He's still out there. He thinks he got away with it. I mean, he's laughing at you. [DAVE] Why take the risk, right? Send him back. He'll get other Todd for you. I'll stay as collateral. - Dave. - [TECHNICIAN GRUNTS] He thinks he won. [SCOFFS] Don't you just want to smash his stupid face in? - Dave. - Shut up. So you're willin' to bet your life that he doesn't just disappear? He wouldn't do that. [TECHNICIAN SIGHS] All right, back inside. - What? - What? You want to go back or not? - [LEVER THUDS] - [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] [EERIE ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC] [TODD] You shouldn't have done that. Well, if I didn't we'd both be dead, so save it. What if I can't send him back? There's always plan B. - You're the man. - I am the man. Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Come on. [GROWLS] - [DAVE YELPS] Don't move. And you, you've got 'til sundown. Or else. [IMITATES FLESH SQUELCHING] Hey. Say hi to Lucy for me. [SOMBER ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC] [COMPUTER CHIRPING] [LEVER CLUNKS] [MACHINES WHIRRING] [LEVER CLUNKS] - [MACHINES BEEPING] - [HANDLE CRANKING] [MACHINE BUZZING] [AIR WHOOSHING] [KEYBOARD CLICKING] [AIR WHOOSHING] [KEYS CLACKING] [COMPUTER CHIRPING] [MACHINE BUZZING] [HANDLE CLANGING] - [LEVER CLUNKING] - [MACHINE STRUGGLING] What? Low power? - [SLAMS COMPUTER] - [COMPUTER BEEPS] - [SWITCH CLICKS] - [ELECTRICITY WHIRRING] Yes, yes. Don't move. [DAVE ON PHONE] It was just a big misunderstanding. So, um, if I don't see you before you go, you know, have a great tri... It sounds normal to me. Yeah, but the way that it just ends, and his tone. His tone is weird. I don't know him very well, but based on his behavior the other night? Yeah, but that wasn't like him. Something was going on. Yeah, maybe. No, I mean, yeah. But, look... Dave has this theory that Todd isn't Todd. That it's an impostor. [ABBY LAUGHS] [CHUCKLING] Lucy, that's ridiculous. Who else could it be? I don't know, but... something is different. Todd is different. I thought that was a good thing. It is. I mean, it was, but... something just isn't right. [GENTLE PIANO MUSIC] Hey. Well, I'm going to go. It was nice to see you, Todd. It was nice to see you, too. [DOOR CLICKS SHUT] Hey, babe. How are ya? How'd it go with Dave? It went really well. It's good, I think we really worked it out now. Really? 'Cause I got kind of a strange message from him. I have a surprise for you. We're goin' to Seattle. I know. No. No, no, wait. No, no, no, we're, we're, We're goin' tonight. [TENSE MUSIC] I'm not going to wait to spend the rest of my life with you. It starts tonight. Do you remember that fight we had last week? Yes. Yes. I never apologized to you. No, no, there's... - You don't need to. - It's just, I really love you in that shirt. I know you do. It's okay. Go pack a bag. Okay. [DAVE ON PHONE] Hey, it's Dave, uh. Leave me a message. Hi, Dave, it's me. Just please call me back as soon as you get this. I think you might be right. I just, I want to make sure you're okay. So just, please, please, call me back. Shit, shit, shit. Shit. [GASPS] [OTHER TODD] Babe, you okay? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I just, I stubbed my toe on the radiator. - Want some ice or something? - No, thank you. What the fuck. [TODD] Lucy. Lucy, oh, my God. Here, come on. [TODD GROANS] [TODD] Lucy. - I thought I'd never see you again. - Shh. Okay, what is happening? - I was in a parallel universe. - What? And the other me, a parallel me, he sent me here so he could take my place. - Oh, you can't be serious. - If I'm not serious, then why are there two Todds? Okay, okay, okay. It was terrible. But Other Dave was there. And he helped me, and now I'm back. And we have to send Other Todd back, or Dave, Other Dave, he's in trouble. - Do you know what I'm saying? - No. Okay, in case anything happens, I need you to know that you were right. I'm sorry, I do have a fucking bullshit - resistant attitude. - No, no, no. I shouldn't have pushed you. Of course I want to go with you, of course I do. I just, I need to get out of my own way. This is something we should have decided together. I needed to realize how important it was to you. And honestly, what a small sacrifice it is to go somewhere - that's really still in this universe. - Todd. It wasn't until I saw what the world would be like without... Okay, Todd, Todd. I love you, too, but I need you to shut up right now. Because I think something happened to Dave. - Our Dave, what happened? - All I know is that he went to see him, and now Dave is not answering his phone. I know exactly what happened. We need to get Other Todd back to the lab. I swear to God, you are not making any sense right now. I'm going to call you in five minutes. Pretend I'm Dave. Trust me. - Okay. - Okay. [GENTLE MUSIC] [OTHER TODD] Talkin' to someone? I left a message for Dave. I just wanted to let him know the good news. Oh. That's nice. [CELLPHONE BUZZING] Oh, hey, Dave. Yeah, he's here, why? Oh, no. [CHUCKLES] Hey, buddy, what's goin' on? Dave, you all right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, no problem. All right, just stay there. He's wasted. I guess he had too many drinks at the bar. I'm going to go pick him up, take him home. - Let me come with you. - No, no, no, no. I got it, I'm good. You, uh... Someone's got to pack, so. [TENSE MUSIC] [OTHER TODD WHISPERS] Oh, shit. Lucy. I can explain. I wish someone would. [PANTING] Listen, I know this looks bad. But I did this for you. Okay, so you impersonated my boyfriend and kidnapped my brother for me? Okay, I may be guilty of a little light kidnapping. But I am Todd. I'm Todd Plus. I'm better than Other Todd. - You're Other Todd! - You're Other Todd! All right, all right. Yes, you might be more passionate than Todd, and slightly thinner. But you, you're not Todd. [OTHER TODD] Listen... I did this to be, I did this to be with you again. What do you mean? You didn't tell her? I was going to... I was going to tell you. Lucy, I did this because, where I'm from, I lost you. You died. And I had to be with you. [SOFT AMBIENT MUSIC] Okay. That's, uh... that's really sweet. But you didn't do this for me. No, I did it to be, I did it to be with you. That's not the same thing. I am really sorry about what happened. - Lucy. - But I'm not her. No, you, you are her. No, I'm not. [OTHER TODD CRIES] You need to go back. [HEAD THUDDING] [OTHER TODD SIGHS] [OTHER TODD SOBS] [FIST THUDS] - Hey, bro. - Holy shit. A little help here? Jesus Christ. Have you been there the whole time? Mm, I should have listened to you. I was right. You were right. I'm really glad you and Todd are together. Yeah? Yeah, Other Todd's an asshole. So they're ready in there if you want to... I don't know, say goodbye or whatever. Do you think that's appropriate? [JAZZY MELANCHOLIC PIANO MUSIC] Okay. [COMPUTER CHIRPING] [SIGHS] Hey, Lucy? Yeah? Did you sleep with him? Todd. Not a good time. I get it, not a good time. - [HANDLE CRANKING] - [MACHINES WHIRRING] [AIR WHOOSHING] [AIR WHOOSHING] - [DOOR THUDDING] - Damn it! [TECHNICIAN] You're the... [TECHNICIAN GRUNTING] Ow, damn it. - What about ice cream? Is it all the same flavors? - Yes. - What about the sky? - It's blue. Do dogs bark, do birds swim? Do fish fly? What, like... - Did you just ask if birds swim? - What was this other me like? Is he insane, too? 'Cause you were insane. No, no. He was a good guy. Yeah, he was like you but smarter. Oh, you are such an asshole. [CHUCKLES] - But he did have a mustache. - Yeah? - That was different. - Really? Mm-hmm, yeah. What do you think? You think I should grow one? No. I didn't say it looked good. [TODD SIGHS] Oh, shit, I missed the fishing trip. No, I get it. Circumstances and everything. - Yeah. - What are you doin' tomorrow? - Fishing? - Yep. - [CAR DOOR CLOSES] - Oh, hey, Dave. - Yeah? - You know Abby, right? Yeah, Lucy's cute friend that hates me? [TODD LAUGHS] That's, that's pretty funny. Why is that funny? - See ya later, man. - Todd. Why is that funny? I have no idea what's going on. Yes, I do see here that it says nonrefundable tickets. But it's a funny story, 'cause I actually, I didn't book the tickets. Yes, that's me. No, I didn't change my mind. I didn't, [LAUGHS] like I said, I know it's... It's a long story. Okay. All right, thank you. Bye. So they don't take the whole twin - from another universe excuse? - No. No, they didn't, but now we have a 2,500 dollar credit, so. So. [TODD] So. I got offered a job in Seattle. - I know. - No, Todd, we're starting over. Oh, okay. Sorry. I was offered a job in Seattle. What do you think? I think that's a swell opportunity, Luce. - You think we should go? - I'm glad you asked. I think we should make a quick pro, con list. - Terrific idea. - Great. [CURIOUS PIANO MUSIC] Scooch. Okay. Pro, Providence. We'd get to see your brother more. Con, Providence, we'd have to see my brother more. Okay, great, those cancel out. Okay. Pro, Providence. Oh, did I mention that Dave and Abby are married - in the parallel universe? - No. Yes, yeah, that's entirely true. That's a distant universe. [BABY BABBLES] Oh. Read it. What? You want me to read you the book? Read it. Okay. So once upon a time, there was a little boy who went to a parallel universe. And then he tried to get the girl. And then things don't work out as he had planned. But it all kind of works out in the end, so...
