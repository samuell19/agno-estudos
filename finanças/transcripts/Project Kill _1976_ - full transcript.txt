-Now what you've just seen is a reenactment of a successful interdiction operation that took place six years ago. Interdiction and protective reaction. Those will be your areas of duty. This unit, which are also hot to become members of, came about because of the events that occurred in the early 60s, that is the only effective means of combating political assassination by the interception and the destruction of the assassin himself. Now you might have been carefully selected for this program, because of a high level performance in the battlefield and your high level performance in physical endurance. But as your training progresses, you will gradually reach a point of acceptance where you will begin to surpass everything that you have ever done before. You will reach goals that you never dreamed possible. And to accomplish this, you will be given vitamins to increase your stamina, chemical injections to expand your mental capabilities, injections to assist you in both physical and mental control. You will be programmed to respond instantaneously to any given stimulus. You will become a reflex but highly directive unit. Of course, you will be taught how to use everyday objects as weapons. Everything from a toenail clipping to a briefcase. Control, control will be emphasized throughout your training. Control, control is the key. When you're finished here, you will be assigned to safeguard specific individuals and institutions. And because of your training here, it will be set apart from other security agencies and military establishments. In other words, you will operate independently. I am your commanding officer. You will refer to me only as Mr. Trevor. Your second in command, you will address him only as Mr. Lassiter. -Stand. What's your project? - Kill. -Again. - Kill. -What's your priority? -Dossiers on the new men. -Just leave them on the desk. -One of them had a couple of tours in Nam. Looks like a top prospect for a VIP bodyguard. I'd say reaction to the film was excellent, didn't you? -Oh, yeah. Yeah, I wonder what the star of that film looks like today. -John, the original concept of the project is-- -I've had the project for six years, Frank. I've had enough. -OK. Now you're the head of it. Doesn't that mean something? -The program has changed. Can't you see that? The project is different. It's more drugs now, more mind control. -Well, it's necessary-- -The whole thing is wrong, Frank. -Have you had your injections today, John? -Want some water? -Nope. What about the injections? -No, I had no injections today. -What you're thinking is dangerous. -What are you talking about, the drugs or the project? -Both. Withdrawal has got to be gradual. You need to be deprogrammed. If you're not deprogrammed, you'll be a menace to society, to yourself, and you know that. -Deprogramming takes months. -Nobody gets out of here. Not you, especially not you. -I've been training robots here for six years, for offensive purposes, that's what I've been told. That's what I tell them. Now two weeks ago, got three teams of graduate trainees sent on missions abroad. You know, I've sensed this for two years now. I think it's true. We're being used for offensive missions. -That's necessary, John. -Oh, don't give me that crap. Wasn't born yesterday, didn't get here on a mule, and neither did you. We're being trained as hit men. We can be used as political, corporate, and commercial weapons. And you know damn well that's exactly what's happening. -So what the hell are you going to do about it? -What can I do? I know what I can do. I can hold a press conference, blow the whistle on this Pandora's box, and put the whole thing down the toilet where it belongs. -You can't do that, and you won't do that. -Frank, I'm going out. -Lassiter 712. Yeah. Get me a medical survey team over here as soon as possible. Yeah. -I'm sorry, Frank. -Mr. Trevor, please step out of the car. -Anything wrong? -I'll have to see your identification. -You should never go into action without a recon in the area, friend. -Our old friend, Hook, ambushed me. -You son of a bitch. One of these years when you've managed to drag your ass to Manila, without any advance planning, I'm going to put another hole in it for you, whether I know who you are not. -I have to see an old friend, Carl. You all right, Hook? -Never mind about that, you two. Let's have a drink. Hook, break open the good booze, will you? As for you, you S.O.B., you've got about two minutes before the bourbon hits the glass. And I want a complete rundown of your activities for the last four years. Now let's make it. Underwater detonations were always more dangerous. The VC put two shells into my destroyer. I know. -You were always meant for sea command, Carl. That's why Polish had never even listed you in that project. -Hit him again. He's getting behind. Project. I should have quit that after that training film we made. What the hell ever happened to that anyway? -It's around. -All that training. Me and Hook, we were the best. Oh, we drew-- we drew a rough assignment, but I tell you when that ship's magazine when out, it was a sight to see. -No, Carl, I'll never forgive the project for what it did to you. To you both. And it's happening to us all. Mentally. -You mean, they went on with that? After the war, all of it? That's not right for you. -Why do you say that? -I can see it in your face, John. Cut them loose. Let them sink in their own swill. -Maybe I've done that. -Hey. You OK? -Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. -Look then, why don't you come out here with us? We can have a crew again, just the three of us. Huh? -Thing's can't be the way they were, Carl. -Just remember, John, you can't forget the past. -I know that. That's the trouble. And I've got to keep moving. -Come on, hit him again. He's fallen behind. All right, a toast. Here's to the sweet ladies and their silk dresses. -Trevor was part of the top secret vote of the United States. There are many other that are willing to pay any price for what he knows. We will comb the entire island resort if we have to. But I want him alive. -Yes, sir. -We will find the man, sir. -Yes, sir, Mr. Lee. -Is he asleep? Well, we were damn good sailors once, Hook, in all kinds of water. You think I need that? The way I figure it, we got $300,000 in the kitty, right? I'm going to take half. You keep half. When's the last time you took him to the doctor? Two, what, weeks? When he wrote to me, and said there was a chance that the deterioration could be arrested. They still feel that way? All right, when I get to wherever I-- wherever I'm going, I'll refill the kitty. You tell him I won't be back for a while, so some kind of military insurance, or change in the law, or something handle that. At least we could buy back his legs, or give him a day on a destroyer. You go on to bed. I know where my bunk is. And the of the shore shall pluck the eagle of the sea. -Got time for coffee? Didn't mean to upset you. -You don't sleep very late, do you? -Time enough for that when I'm old and infirmed. I poured one for you. You know, you're about as sneaky as an elephant. -Thank you. I'll remember that the next time I'm in a tight spot. -You better remember it before then if you want to get your butt out of that tight spot. -I'm going to take the old car. Head out to the countryside. -Just avoid crowds. I checked this morning. Things are going around. -I need a boat, Carl. -Give me a couple days, then call that number. His name's Kitolis. -When's the last time you saw me? - in 1970. -What'd I look like? -Like hell. -What will you do when you see me again? -Lay you on your butt for the $20 you still owe me. -If anybody comes by, I wasn't here. -Friends? -Who's got friends, Carl? -OK. There's your man. -Mr. Lassiter. I'm Lynn Walker. I'm the US Officer. Is there any cover story for the press on this situation? -No. There's not going to be. -Well, we'll have to tell them something. -Well, that's fine. do the telling. You see, Mr. Trevor's a very dangerous man. I think it's best we keep it from the local press. -Well, I have my job to do, too, Mr. Lassiter, and I intend to do it. -Mr. Lassiter. I'm Inspector Cruz. Yours, please? This is my associate, Inspector Ortiz. -How do you do, Mr. Lassiter. -Please follow us. - You see, we thought he might be here in Manila. He mentioned a few people, no one by name, so we suggest you begin by screening the American community, discreetly, of course. -You spent some time in Hong Kong. You must know there are others interested in Mr. Trevor's whereabouts. Mr. Ortiz. -A private plane just arrived at the Manila International carrying seven undesirable passengers by an indirect route through or from Hong Kong. -You know them? -Uh-hmm. A man called Alok Lee, an international trader. -In what? Anything of value. -Of course, they are under observation, but-- -But what? -We were ordered to stand off. Mr. Lassiter. What do you know? -How should I know? -Of course, how should you know? Obviously, there's something of great value involved to bring Alok himself here. - He had the. - The. Such things could be handled through intermediaries and usually are. -Uh, Inspector, I have no other information I can give you. -I see. Well, then, perhaps before you retire to your hotel you might ease my apprehension in another area. -Sure, if I can. -What was Trevor's motive for all this? -OK. He has an illness. About three weeks ago, he went through his annual physical at Walter Reed. It's a malignancy. It's terminal. And it's inoperable. You see, Inspector, he's a man who worked for government agencies all of his life. He lived in a sterile apartment with sterile people around him. -He wasn't paid well? -Oh, yeah, quite well, but let's say not well enough to cover a lifetime of experiences he never had. A man like that wants the best, and it takes money. The plates are worth millions, and, uh, with them he can buy himself a new life regardless of how short it might be. At least that's how we look at it. -I see. -Oh, Ortiz, when you get back, talk to Cruz. I didn't get Miss Walker back to her desk at the embassy. -The big one is Lassiter. -Why so quiet? I thought you were an accomplished conversationalist. -They told me about the man you killed in the garage. It was an accident, Miss Walker, just an accident. -That accident was on foreign soil. It may not concern you, but I'm the one who has to make the explanation. -Well, you're the picture of efficiency. It shouldn't be too difficult for you. Hey, look, as long as we're stuck with one another, let's try to get along, OK? -The man you're after is a man like you, isn't he? -He's not like me. He's a lot better at his job than I am. Excuse me. Lassiter, I have a reservation. -Mr. Lassiter? -Yes. -We expected you last night. If you don't mind, registration, sir? Oh, by the way, a friend of yours waiting at the bar. -A friend of mine? -Yes, sir, that's what he said. -Did you tell anyone I was coming? -No. -Uh, where's this bar of yours? -Straight ahead, sir. -Thank you. -Can I help you, sir? -Yes, I was wondering if you could get me a room next to Mr. Lassiter's? We are going to be conducting some business here, and we need to confer frequently. -See anyone you know? -No. -Mr. Lassiter. Well, Mr. Lassiter, it's been a long time. How have you been? -Do I know you? -In a way. You and your friend tried to wreck our car in the garage this morning. -Oh, yeah. Excuse me a minute, boys. Miss Walker, go look at the fish. Pretty fish. Anyway, Pancho, you said something about the garage? -I just want you to know that we don't hold any grudge. -I do. -You're joking. -See you, boys. -Hey, wait a minute. You and your lady friend Have a drink with us. -OK. -OK. - Me and my. Right, Ramon? -Careful, Mr. Lassiter, don't have any more accidents. -How are the pretty fish? -Lassiter here. - I - have a coded message for you. Can you take it? -Yeah. Security one code. -OK, ready. It's one, eight, windfall, 63-- 043 your location. Copy? -OK. Proceed immediately on this. -I have it, sir. Is this the only contact here? Yes, act fast, or he'll the whole program. -No, I know that, sir. He's dangerous. -Yeah, I know he's dangerous. Find him. Get it finished. -Right away, sir. -Are you all right? -What? -Are you all right? I saw you from over there. -No, I'm fine. I'm just fine, thank you. Just a minute. What, uh, what's your name? Where do you come from? -My name's Lee Su from the lodge. -Uh, Lee Su, stay with me. -All right. Walk with me. What's your name? -Ryder, uh, Bill Ryder. -Mr. Ryder. -You're staying here at the lodge? -Uh-huh. -Have you been here long? -A few days. -I just came in myself. I'm glad you're here. I, uh, hope that we'll see each other again. -I hope so, too. The lonely world is a lonely place where a lonely time is shared by all. Summer, winter, springtime and fall. It never rains, but it always pours. And the lonely streets are filled with tears. From crying eyes that wasted the years. I reached out-- -Good evening, sir. Table for one, sir? -Uh, no, thank you. I see somebody I know. Hello. -Hello. -May I join you? -Please. -Have you ordered? -No. I was hoping someone might join me. -Hmm. -Mr. Ryder. Are you all right? -Oh, yea, I'm fine. Just too much night life, I guess. Well, cheers. -Cheers. -Is today the day? Found his mothership, did they? How many? And it's not the law? Have a drink Mr. Hook. Prepare to do battle. Answer to a prayer. Open up the door, Mr. Wagner. We know you're in there. if you cooperate, there will be no trouble. You are talking to the , Mr. Wagner. Open this door. -Mr. Wagner, let me commend you. A formidable bit of resistance. But now that this is all over, I want you to tell me what your friend Trevor is. -You go to hell. -Mr. Wagner, I do not want you to endure more pain. Trevor has something I'm interested in, and for which I have a customer. You cannot win now, Mr. Wagner. The spade will pierce your mask of thought. When I get out of here, I will get what I want from you. Foolish, Mr. Wagner. Foolish and-- - It's. Beautiful. - Beautiful. -No, it's a word I haven't used for a long time. -Why? -Well, I just traveled in the wrong circles. -You're a strange man, Mr. Ryder. But I think I like you. Shall we walk? -May I see your ID, please? Well, Mr. Lassiter. Strange meeting you here. Coincidence no doubt. -What happened? -A battle, obviously. -Oh. Miss Walker, if this is a bit much for your stomach, you can, uh, wait in the car. OK, Cruz, how'd you find out about-- -Routine investigation. A dossier on Trevor was most interesting. It will be in the name of history. We cross check that with a list of Americans who live here in Manila. And we came up with one man who served with him. Carl Wagner. A winner of the Navy Cross for gallantry in action. Gallantry, Mr. Lassiter. You know what the word means? -Who can afford gallantry these days, Cruz? -You may be right, of course it is an old word, but not everyone has forgotten it. -Where is he? -Outside. -Oh, my god. -What are you going to do about this? --his associates from Hong Kong. At the moment, nothing. -How'd he find out about Wagner? -How did you find out about Wagner? -Operator, I've been trying for a half an hour. Wagner. Wagner, W-A-G-N-E-R. That's right. That's the number. Disconnected when? All right, fine. Thank you. -Is something wrong? -I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. No, there's nothing wrong. Just trying to contact an old friend. It's OK. -Don't you sleep? -Old habits hard to break. -You've seen much trouble haven't you, Mr. Ryder? -A little. -You have no monopoly on that. -On what? -Trouble. -I know that, too, but I'm a little concerned about my own, though. -Yes, because you know them best. You want much in life. I mean, of life. -Not much. All I know is I don't want what I've had anymore. And I don't know what's up front, because I'm used to that. I'm feeling like a-- like a kid, weak inside. If I cashed out tomorrow, not a single person would ever know I existed. And really, I'd just be another dead soldier. And I think that what I want is someone who really cares that I've been alive. You know, someone I can trust. And someone who would trust me. A woman. -It's not a want, same as I. -Oh, who the hell knows what they want or who the hell knows anything? -I am but one, and you want many things. -Well, you see how foolish I am. -No. Dreaming is not foolish. I will dream with you. And if you also want, I will love you. -That was Trevor. Hurry. Let's go. -Hold on. I think we've got company. -You idiot. -Mr. Cruz asked me to join him this morning. -Now, first things first, a letter from your agency. -I already won Mr. Lassiter. -Excuse me. Pardon me, Chief Inspector Cruz. -Yes. -You have a telephone call on our private phone. Urgent, please. -Thank you. Excuse me. -Have you been in counselor service long, Miss Walker? -Four years. -Dedicated? -Well, of course. -This is a secret priority one message I read and I understand it. -What shou I do? What would you do with it? -Well, shred it and burn it. -I can't do that here. -I don't understand what you're getting at. -Oh, if you're really dedicated, you'd grab it and eat it. Then you wouldn't use a public toilet for two weeks. -We just got some information of your friend. -What? - Mr. Cruz. -Go ahead. We have just confirmed a report that Mr. Trevor was seen this morning accompanied by a Chinese woman along the vicinity of Lake Lodge. There is also a report from the highway patrol that this same vehicle was involved in a high speed racing along the Lake Highway. -Where is he? -There is no further report, sir, except that the vehicle was not apprehended and has not been sighted since. Well, how far is this Lake. -Just a short trip by rail. -Why don't we get up there, like, right away? -Everything has been arranged for, Mr. Lassiter. - You have 45 minutes to. -Give me a few minutes. I'll throw a few things in my bag, and I'll be right down. -So you have 45 minutes. If you had taken proper security measures to begin with, that phone conversation never would have happened. Time is getting short. -I'm aware of the time element. Nine days is all we can expect. -What? Well, he's already gone 10 days. -He's beyond normal restraints. -Sir, I have another hot tip for you. Somebody took my medication. -And your last injection? -About 30 hours. I assume it was in your attache case. Did they steal that, too? -Yeah. You Trevor. -But what happens if I don't get to him in time? What happens if he goes completely off the deep end? If you're still capable of handling the operation quietly with no publicity, we can alleviate-- -But personally, sir, I don't give a damn about the publicity. What about the man? What do I do? What do I do? -This is a priority one situation, which with serious international implications. You may have no choice. Bring him back or I'll eliminate him. -I just wanted to hear you say it, sir. Miss Walker, who authorized this trip anyway? -I told you before. I can take care of myself. I authorize my own trips, and I go where I feel I have to go. And let me give you a bit of advice, Mister. Pull any more of your superiority gimmicks, and this is one Ratclife girl who can have you deported in nothing flat. -Oh, really? -That's right. And I mean it. -All right, by all means, be my guest, Miss Walker. -I'd like to remind you, gentlemen, we have no way of finding out how many, if any, of the Hong Kong are still in the vicinity. So this trip is primarily one of investigation. Sergeant, please see to our seats. -Yes, sir. -Lassiter, are you ready? -Not really, Cruz, I can't get used to the heat out here. -Something you'll have to bear. Let's go. -Everybody, get down. Get an ambulance. How's Ortiz? -It's not serious. No major organs damaged. In fact, he'll be released in a couple of weeks. You reacted very quickly. It could have been worse. -OK, OK. So I'm a terrific person. What about Trevor? -Well, since the attack was made before we left the depot, I assume that Alok is still in Manila. Which leads me to conclude that Trevor is also here. He'll be located. -Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. What if your assumption is wrong? What if he doesn't have the time, and what if he bumps the car in the meantime? - There are only so many people on who could or would help him off the island. And we know all of them. -And Alok doesn't know those people, too? Look, we're not dealing with a moron. Alok business is abroad. Listen, it would be of great help to us if you were to cooperate fully. And stop withholding information intentionally. -Oh, gee. Come on. We're back to that one, huh? -We never left there Mr. Lassiter. Look, if I were to accept your excuse for wanting Trevor, I'd have to ask many more questions. I don't think that's necessary. If Alok wanted those things, he'd have bought them. But what he wants is the man, and that's quite a different thing. -What's different? Hmm? Mr. Lassiter, the difference is that if you want to play game, you can go do it somewhere else. Not in my country. -I think you forget. I am here by accident, not choice or design. -That's precisely my point. Look, the stupidity, the stupidity of which this operation has been handled has been nothing but a complicated situation from the start. -I agree. Because I'm not directing it. -I know. But when you're in the Philippine's, I am. And Mr. Lassiter. you will cooperate, or you can get the hell out. What are you doing for him? , that is all. That is not all. You tell us what arrangements did you make with him? None. He boat to contact me again. What does he want from you? A boat. Did he ask for that? No, no. Wagner called. He said that, uh-- So, ah-ah, you lied about Wagner. Please, please, I just sell service and that is all. You are going to tell us everything about this. Do you hear me? Everything. Do you understand? No, no, I-- -You have a friend named Wagner? -Yes. -So do I. What can I do for you? -I have a business proposition for you. -You might come in and talk about it. -Yes, that's exactly what I have in mind. -They work for Alok Lee and international dealer from Hong Kong. -Who's this? -My secretary. They killed the poor man. He couldn't tell them what he didn't know. -And you? -They mentioned Wagner. And a man named Trevor. You? -What about Wagner? -He's dead. -What? -He is dead. -You have any liquor here? -Yes. -Then pour two drinks, and pour them where I can see you. I need a boat. -I know. -Tonight. -Out of the question, impossible. It would take at least a week. I'll give you $50,000, two days. -$75,000, three days. The best I can do. -All right, it's a deal. There's $50,000, and I'll call you tomorrow. There'll be two of us. -Two? In that case the price will be $25,000. -Well, Mr. Wagner and I have done much business over the years. Profitable business I might add. -Yeah, I know all about it. Here's to fools and sailors. -Well, well, Miss Walker, if you don't stop following me, I'm going to call the police. -I'm working with the police. -Oh, yeah, I forgot. I'm sorry. -You've been drinking. -Damn, I wish I could. Hey, could I offer you one? We can't be machines all the time, you know. -I don't drink on duty. -It won't rust your gears. -No thank you. -Miss Walker, for someone who's done so much for their country, you deserve a little enjoyment. -Well, there is one little bit of enjoyment I will allow myself. -OK. -Before I left for the train today, I received a message from my director asking me to call off this thing. You arranged that, didn't you? -No, I didn't. But it's cool, because you don't belong here, and I don't want you here. -Oh, man's work, is that it? -Golly, you guessed it. -It was all right a few seconds ago when you wanted a few creature comforts. -You guessed it again. -Oh, you are a son of a bitch. -Lee Su. Forgive me. -Why? Why did you-- -Please, believe me. I can't help it. -I don't understand. -I take drugs. drugs. I mean it that I'm part of a military program, and I train men to kill. I train them, and I am one of them. And we use drugs in the programs. I've taken myself off the drugs, but they're part of my control. Without them, my response is I wake up dangerous. I thought I could handle it. And I need. - The. I brought it. -Where? Give it to me. Get some water. It's not the same anymore for me. I don't know where it's different, but it is different for me now. And when all of this is out of me-- -Shh. The pills. -Yeah, pills. That's something different. That's never happened before. Interesting. He said, I'm not programmed for love. -Remember what I said. Tell him no more, no less, but get him here. -Yes. Yes, it is. I have it all arranged. This afternoon. At the old wharf near the dry dock and bring the rest of the money. Very well. I'll be waiting for you. -Excellent. Excellent. Very well done. -Now may I-- aaah. -A most interesting analysis. The attache case we found in Mr. Lassiter's room was quite interesting. , manipulative, mind drugs, and yet in Mr. Lassiter's attache case-- tell me, old friend. Did Trevor appear pale when you saw him? -No. -Did his hand shake? -I don't know. -His eyes, how did his eyes look? -I don't know. I don't know. -You are not very observant, old friend. I was so certain you would have much to tell me. I told you I would pay you for your services, didn't I? -No, wait. I helped you. I did as you asked. -We'll burn some incense for you, dear friend. -No, no. You promised me. We had a deal. No, no, please. -Yes, you are being paid to have no fear. I leave you in very experienced hands. It will be a beautiful thing. He's an artiste. -Well, good morning Miss Walker. -Headache, Mr. Lassiter? You know, Kitolis who lives here specializes in procurements of all kinds. Either he or Trevor left two bodies here yesterday. And, uh, William. -You going to tell me where Trevor is? -Stop it. Stop that. We can use him. -Inspector, I didn't throw one killing punch. -Well, it's a good thing you didn't, because he knows a lot. We'll make him talk. He'll talk. I promise you, you can finish him off if he doesn't. -Well, Cruz, I hope that dude was telling the truth. How far is it to this wharf? -Just a few minutes. Our surface unit should be closing in now quietly, no sirens. -I'm against this. You know, if we go in there like a squad of marines, Trevor might, might break. -Thank you Mr. Lassiter. It's unfortunate that your superiors didn't give you another option. -Frank. I know what you're going to do. You're going to try to take him alone, aren't you? -The only thing I can do. -But what if he doesn't listen to you? What if he resists? -All right. No matter what happens, you stay here in the car. It's going to be all right, but don't you move until I get back. -Mr. Ryder. Will you kiss me? -Mr. Trevor. We are about to meet at last. There is no need to hide from me. You are completely surrounded. Cut off. And we have the girl. -Who are you? -That doesn't matter, does it? You have something I want, and I have something you want. -All right. What do you want? -Come out without your weapon. And I'll come out without mine. We can settle this with no further trouble. Come, Mr. Trevor Here is Mr. Lassiter's attache case. We'll leave for you. -Frank Lassiter's here? -Come closer. I do not want to shout. -This is what you get. Now what? -Very well. Project Kill is what I want. I want to know everything about it. I will trade you the girl's life. That and a considerable sum of money in any currency you name. -Where's my boat? -Your contact had an accident. You can have this boat if you agree to my request. The girl will be returned to you. You have my word. -Who are you? Just a businessman. -Let the girl go now. -I cannot do that Mr. Trevor. I have invested a large sum in you. If I want to do one more to get what I want, I will. -You've been following me for some time now, haven't you? -Do not use the word following. Investigate is a better word. It started from Mr. Wagner, and, uh-- - I want to get on that wharf is wasting. -All right. For the first time, men, keep your fire above their heads. , you tell the chopper to stop that boat at the end of the wharf. OK, Lassiter, it's your show. -Aah, ah. Mr. Trevor, please. I did not do anything. I left her back there. I left her back there. Mr. Trevor, please, please. I keep. Please. Aah. -And this is for an old friend. And this is for the sailor. -John, you've got to come back with me. -I'm not going back, Frank. -I'll have to take ya. -I'm going around you. If you think you can take me, go ahead and try.
