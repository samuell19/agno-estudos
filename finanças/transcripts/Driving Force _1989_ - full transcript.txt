BASE (ON SPEAKER): What do you got Mobile Two? Got run off the road! Wasn't a damn thing I could do about it. BASE (ON SPEAKER): I'm warning you, Mobile Two. No, I-- Son of a gun, I'll tear your damn head off! Son of a bitch, I'll knock the hell out you! My God Almighty! I almost [INAUDIBLE] Jimmy O'Neill's little boy! Steve, how are ya? You old buzzard! Come here you old boy! What the hell are you doing tied up with scum like that? Ah, God. It's called a job, Pete. It sounds more like a criminal occupation! Hell, I thought you had a real job! Had. I had a real job. Now I got another real job, which I guess is better than no job at all. Ha, ha. You think so? [LAUGHTER] I'm sorry, darling. They came out of nowhere. You're going to be OK. Well, somebody screwed up here. Let me get your signature right here. My name? Where I marked the Xs. What about the ambulance? It's coming. [GROANING] Well, well. It's very nice.

Come on. Come on. There were are. There. OK, right there. You sign that. I really think you don't pay much attention to it, do you? [GROANING] Game! [SLEDGEHAMMERING] Now, you sign? It's not really my car. We just borrowed it. Darlin' if I could get you to sign right here, we'd be in business. Look at her arm. Can't you wait till the ambulance gets it? [GROANING] I'm sure we can squeeze one more signature out of it, don't you? Excuse me. [SCREECHING TIRES] How are they doing? We've got it taken care of. I'll bet you have. This friend of mine is taking a rest. He needs a few moments to himself. You've got a problem with that? You've got to handle then. This man is still breathing. [FIST FIGHTING] Ow. [CROW BAR HITS PAVEMENT] Oh my God. Are you OK? Ooh. Is there anything I can do? Take me home. You're delirious. And I'm not that sort of girl. I wouldn't have asked if you were. Kind of a paradox, if you know what I mean. You're not sort of girl that will let me take her home if I asked her. And that's the only sort of girl I ever ask. You are delirious. Yeah. What happened to you? You look like you've been run over. Done, done over. Lets go, honey. Just a minute, Charlie. We're going to be late. Ooh, you better go. OK. I'll hope to see you again sometime. Yeah, maybe. The name's Steve. Harry. Harry? Daddy wanted a boy. Well I'm glad he was disappointed! Bye! [SIRENS] Gentlemen. You drive that rig? Yeah. Book him for blocking the road, unless maybe he'd like to make a donation to the smiling policeman fund. [LAUGHS] The what? You make the donation, I smile. I see. Now piss off out of here. This is Black Knight territory. Black Knight, huh? Base to Mobile Two. Base to Mobile Two. Mobile Two, here. BASE (ON SPEAKER): Where are you Mobile Two? I got men waiting to start working that wreck. Well you better tell them it might be a little bit longer. I came in second again. BASE (ON SPEAKER): I think I've heard enough Mobile Two. Three of you. You know what the agreement is. Oh, I know the agreement. A wreck a day or I'm out of the way. And you're out. And you better bring that truck back in. Over and out. I may be down, but I am not out. Nice work! You'll be getting a bonus this week! You mean, all this and we get paid too? Whoa! What a life! Now! Hi! Dan, what do you got? Allow me. Nelson wants this on that rig, capiche? You think that new guy's still in town? [INAUDIBLE]? He won't do it again. I still think it was a big mistake that we let him stay alive. I think he could be a lot of trouble. You do not think! You hear me? You do not think. I think. You do what I think when I think it! [KISS] [LAUGHTER] Better quit screwing around, sicko. [LAUGHTER] [COUGHING] What? you Want to come home hold it for me? Huh? [COUGHING] [LABORED BREATHING] He's kind of losing his touch, isn't he? Shut up. He can still take you out.

That son of a bitch! Shit. You see what I mean? A wreck a day. Are you satisfied now? Look, I don't know where you got that wreck or how you got it. I don't want to know. You just keep coming in and you can keep your job, OK? [NON-ENGLISH CHATTER] Hey, apples. Four, four, please. [MOTORCYCLE ENGINES] [NON-ENGLISH CHATTER] Stay here, sir. Ah, thank you. Here you go. Thank you very much. Yes, sir. Is there anything? I need a dress for my eight-year-old daughter. OK. Let me see. You might like this one. This is cheap. Well, do you have anything that's not government issue? Something pretty, very pretty. I think I might have something you will like. Now that's pretty. That's pretty. Yes. - You like this? [SLAP] Bastard! [TABLE CRASHING DOWN] How about if I take it at 100? 100. Um, 150, and you have it. Um, 150, and you have it. [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE] You bastard! what do you think you're doing? BECKY (ON PHONE): I just got home from school, Grandpa. So you're at home all alone, huh sweetheart? Is that right? BECKY (ON PHONE): I'm not on my own. I've got Mirabelle. Uh-huh. And when will Daddy be home? I don't know. He wasn't sure when he'd be back. Here he is. Bye. Dad! There you are. Hey sweetie. Well, they just got back. Remember, you have to stay out of sight or we don't have a chance. I want that child, John. I know, darling. I know. Driver! All right, let me put you down here. Watch your head. [GRUNTS] Got anything for me? Well, unless you want to help pay that phone bill right there, huh? You make it all right? Oh, dad! Well, I got a little worried when I wasn't able to meet you. There's a lot of weirdos out there, you know. By the way, you'd never take any sweets from any strangers, would you? Right now I'd think about it. I'm starving. Becky! Just kidding. Anything edible in here? Have a pineapple. Wonder who that could be? Probably Grandpa. He rang me from his car phone pretending he was home. But I think he was really around the corner again waiting for you to come home. Is that right? No you cannot come in. And the answer is still the same. Now Steve, be reasonable. Hello Grandpa. Hello sweetheart. Don't force us to take steps we don't have to. Then leave us alone. We'll all be happy. We're not going to be happy until we have our daughter's little girl living with us. Now she's all we have. Down to your last oil well, are you? Don't you see that's just the point Steve? We can give her everything. Everything? No, I don't think so. Beg you honey, get inside. By Grandpa. All right. I'll see you in court. We're going to get custody Steve, you can bet on that. You never married my daughter, did you? And you live in this slum. You have no money. You have no job. And you have no prospects. I want my granddaughter, Steve. Hello Grandma. The galloping grandmother's here too, is she? Listen to me, both. You I have a job. That pays well. You can just forget about this court action, OK? [DOOR SLAMS] Why do we have to have all this healthy stuff? Why don't we have normal food like all the other kids? I'm not concerned about the other kids. I don't want you having all that processed garbage. The ingredients read like a recipe for a chemical warfare. Bet you have junk food when you are young back in the olden days? Back in the olden days? Well, maybe. But since I'm a senior citizen now, I think I know better. What's that? Oh, it's a surprise. What is it? What is it? Close your eyes. Keep them closed. OK, open them. Oh dad. Nobody wears a dress. Becky! You could take it back. They'll change it for something, won't they? Well, I can't understand why you don't like a dress. I mean, you are a little girl, aren't you? That's so sexist. Look what we got here. [GIGGLING] Come on. There you go, motorcycle mama. [MUSIC PLAYING] Daddy! Daddy! [INTERPOSING VOICES] Let go of my dress! [SCREECHING TIRES] [MOTORCYCLE CRASH] [SCREECHING TIRES] Who are they, Daddy? I don't know. Some weirdos. They didn't have sweets. What? Weirdos are meant to give you sweets. Daddy? Yes, honey? Daddy, did mommy love me? Well, of course your mommy loved you very much. I love mommy too. Mhm-hm. Is it all right to love a dead person? Yes, Becky. It's all right. Why weren't you and mommy married? Your mother was a very independent young lady just like you are. OK? If I'm independent, I don't need Grandma to have custody of me, do I? That's right, you don't. I want you to go to sleep now and stop thinking. OK? If I stop thinking, I'd be dead too. Becky, honey. Think in your sleep. Good night. Good night. Hell, it looks like a good spot to me. And don't let my dad get too involved while I'm gone. Ernie, if I have spend another week undoing a whole new set of his disasters, it's going to be your ass. - Yes, Miss Harry. And for God's sakes. Pay the shipping bill. There's only a 1% differential on interest rate and we need them more than they need us! - I'll draw the check. - Today! Today. Enjoy your break Miss Harry. I'll try. Well, we'll get a couple of that one. Hell, we got six out of it the last time. [EXHALES] OK, now guys, can you stay out of sight this time? Hm? Hey, give me a break will ya? I don't know about you guys some time. Hey beautiful. Charlie, how did you get in here? It's called a spare key. I had one cut when you lent me the car, remember? You did what? I had a spare key made. Do you still have it? Yeah. It's how I just got in, honey. Catch. Charlie, I don't understand what gives you the right to have a key made and just come busting into my home? Busting into your home? Harry, we had a date to go up to the farm, remember? Well, I think we better forget that. And I really think you should go. Look Harry, I don't really know what's bothering you right now. But what do you say I make you a nice tall drink. And then we start this all over? Oh, please. You've got to go. Here. What is the problem, Harry? You're the problem Charlie. What is the problem? Bye! [DOOR SLAMS] OK fellas. See you later. It's an old beauty. [BANG] - Got one! Woo! [SCREECHING TIRES] Son of a bitch! Ready? Ready! - Get set! - Set! Go! Go! [TRUCK ENGINE] Yo, sir. Look at what we've got here. Lady, it looks like you need a tow. No, I don't think so. Life is so meaningless on these roads. Lady, be reasonable. This car's not going anywhere without us. It's the suspension. If you tow my car you'll wreck the suspension. Look lady, if you let him tow your car, you can have a ride in my truck with me. Shh. Anything I can do Harry? Easy, Gladys. Good to see you again, Harry. Sorry Nelson. New boy did us over. There was nothing we could do about. Idiots! Recovered from your delirium, huh? Temporary aberration, prone to relapse. Please, no. Not a relapse. Well, I am taking you home, aren't I? [CHUCKLES] Can I ask you a question? Sure. You're not who you seem to be are you? Oh, I am what I seem to be. I'm a tow truck driver. I drive tow trucks for a living. Yeah, but you're not an asshole. That's good. That's good. OK, when did you start driving? Less than a week. See? What I do, I'm an engineer. Sounds redundant the way the economy is. I know. I know there's so many people out of work now, you can't even count them. It's true. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones. It took me 12 months to find another job. 12 months? Yeah, but a tow truck driver? Ah, don't knock. I've had a good day. Two wrecks and a relapse. [GIGGLES] [TRUCK ENGINE] Hold on tight, Harry. Hey new boy! Your ass is mine! [SCREECHING TIRES] Now what the hell is he doing? Being an asshole. Great place you have here. Thank you. Would you like to come in for a drink? Oh come on. It's the least I can do. I've got to go pick up my little girl. Oh. Some other time though. Yeah, why not? How old is she? She's older than me at times. She's 7 and 1/2. I don't like leaving her home on her own. Her mother works, does she? Her mother's a memory. Road accident. I'm sorry to hear that. Uh, Newsome? That's you, Nelson? NELSON (ON SPEAKER): Yeah, it's Nelson. What do you want? OK. I did some thinking. You know, you got to have a problem. You've got a problem, huh? NELSON (ON SPEAKER): I got a problem? Surf, what are you talking about? Hey, you know what I'm talking about. And I decided that somebody has to do something about it. I mean, I going to be the one to fix it. NELSON (ON SPEAKER): Fix it? You don't take a crap without me saying so! Hear me? I going to take care of it. Surf, you listen to me. You get back on this goddamned radio right-- [WHACK] [YELLING] [BANGING] [YELLING] [BANGING] Now [INAUDIBLE]! [FIGHTING SOUNDS] Ah! [GROANING] You son of a bitch. You. Now put this on. I want you to look nice today. Can I cook something for breakfast? Did you hear what I said? Mm, can I? [EXHALES] Aren't you going to say anything? Say anything? About me doing your ironing? You always do my ironing. Can I? Whatever happened to thank you? Thank you. [PHONE RINGS] [EXHALES] Steve O'Neill. Hello Steve. This is John. Leslie and I've been thinking. Even though custody is disputed-- I am not the one disputing it. Just hear me out. While the dispute is being settled, it just seems ridiculous that we can't see Becky from time to time. Now it's such a lovely day. What if we set a car for her, brought her back here so she can enjoy the pool? Sorry, Becky has other plans. Oh really? We are her only grandparents. Can't you understand we'd like to see her? I think you made your position clear last time. Steve, we'll send her back tonight. I don't believe you. We'll get her. And when we do, you'll know what it feels like to be left out. Yeah. Can I cook something for breakfast? No time. Have some muesli. It's all gone! You made it finish it all yesterday. I whipped up some more last night. Oh, no. It's that or nothing! Get dressed. We have a lunch we have to go to. I hope they have normal food. Here we are Harry! Hi! This is Becky. Becky, that's Harry. Nice to meet you Becky. Hi. This is Mirabelle. She's very hungry for something normal. - Becky. - Well come on. I know where you can find something yummy. Something yummy? Ace! And what does Mirabelle like? Chocolate? Ice cream? She likes everything except muesli. This is my getaway. The only place I know where I can totally relax. Well, any time you need a hand to relax, you just let me know. Thanks. You know, I've been coming up here since as a kid. My father was always going to build a home here. So why didn't he? (QUIETLY) I don't know. But I'm going to. I'd like to live here when you build your house. [GIGGLES] She hears everything I say except go to bed. Oh. Well, here's to the home that you to build, the dream home. - Here's to dreams. - Dreams. (LOUDLY) You mind a detour? Where do you want to go? To see a friend. OK. [WHISTLING] Well, strike me! Ah! How are ya? Not as fine as you, I can see! Pete, this is Harry. Harry, Pete. - How are you? - Well, fine. Hi. You are a lucky man. I know a Harry, but he don't look anything like this. And who is this cute little thing? Becky. It's my daughter. Your daughter? Sheesh, it has been a long time. Becky, you sure are a pretty little thing, honey. Thank you. Well, that sure is a pretty thing right there, Pete. Oh, yeah. This is my real true love, I guess. She don't argue with me. And when I take her into town, makes you feel real good. As a matter of fact, I think I'm about ready for a new one. Well, you sound like an old time romantic, Pete. [GIGGLING] See? I told you we could see your house from here. Yes, you're right. Sometimes you get to the risk to start working for yourself. I don't know. It sounds risky. I got Becky to think of, Pete. So? So, if-- if I don't have any income, I'm going to lose. But it will work. You find them and I'll fix them. [SHOULDER SLAP] What do you want? Surf, is that a gas leak I see on that nice machine? [CLICK] You're right, you know. It really is leaking. My friend, you have been causing us a lot of anguish. We don't like anguish. Well, I guess we better let these nice people get on with their friendly little communion, huh? [FIRE SPARKED] Goodnight Daddy. Goodnight sweetheart. [KISS] Mm. Goodnight Harry. Goodnight Becky. Mm. [MUAH] [GIGGLES] Mirabelle hasn't had a kiss. Mm. [MUAH] [KISS] OK? Goodnight. Daddy? Yes honey? Why don't you and Harry kiss each other? You've been waiting to do it all day. Honey, Mirabelle is not the only one that's going to get a spanking. Now go to sleep now. Goodnight, then. Coffee? Mhm. Daddy! Daddy! They're in there! Who honey? The buggies! They're after me! Oh sweetie, no. Come on, you're just having a little dream. No, no. I saw them! OK. I'm going to take you back in the bedroom, OK? No! No, they're in there! Then let's go have a look. [DOOR SQUEAKING] [LIGHT SPARK] [CLICKING] [COMMOTION] Honey, there's nobody here. I saw them Daddy. Sweetie, you just had a dream. That's all. Now I want you back in bed. I'll stay with you until you fall asleep, OK? OK. [WATER SPLASHING] [HUMMING] Ah. [HUMMING] (QUIETLY) Steve. Steve. - Oh, thank you honey. - You're welcome. Morning. Good morning! Good morning sweetie. [KISS] Sleep well? Yeah, very. Coffee? Please. What is this? Muesli. I know it's muesli. I've never seen it go down without a fight before. Ah, but this is the sort the pop stars eat! Oh. Well, hi there. How you doing? Get in there, you old goat. [DOOR BANGING OPEN] Sir, I told them you could not see them. You can't come busting in here. Well, I think we just did. Just like your men. Only we have a damaged anything yet. It's all right Jason. You can go. Now gentlemen. What seems to be the problem? Problem? [THUMPING] That's the remains of an antique Harley Davidson that I've owned since it was brand new. [MUSIC PLAYING] Look who's there. It has nothing to do with you. Are you the boss or aren't you? The Black Knight drivers are free agents. What they do on the road is their own business. You made this your business! [CLATTERING] And send the bill to your boys. [MUSIC PLAYING] Mister! You are supposed to fix any trouble out on the road! Don't worry. I'll fix it. You'd better or your trunk will find itself without a driver. I said I would fix it! [MUSIC PLAYING] You better be careful up there. I will. [ROTARY DIAL PHONE DIALING] Hello? Hello Harry. Oh, hi! You know it's been almost two hours since I talked to you last. Seems longer. You're delirious. BLACK KNIGHT (ON SPEAKER): Black Knight to Nelson. Black Knight to Nelson. They've taken the bait! [TRUCK ENGINE] BASE (ON SPEAKER): Accident on northern distributor near 43rd. That will be yours, Mobile Two. Mobile Two, on my way. [TRUCK ENGINE] [BANG] [SCREECHING TIRES] [CRASH] Hi. Hi. Hello, Daddy. Hi sweetie. How are you doing? Dopey. how long have I been here? A few days. Oh, don't worry. I've been taking care of her. When will we be going home, Daddy? Soon sweetheart. I don't think so. Mr. Levin. Becky, come here dear. Come see what Gramps and I have for you. What's going on? Now we can get rid of this old thing, can't we? - No. - What is this? A court order for the custody of Rebecca Neumann. You mean Rebecca O'Neill. Mr. O'Neill, the court recognizes only the names on the birth certificates. Mr. and Mrs. Neumann had been given custody as the legal next of kin. As you chose not to attend the court to defend the matter, the court had no hesitation in making the custody order. They also took into account the fact that you've lost your job at the tow truck company. You bastards! You see what we're up against. This is the kind of language used in front of the child. We'll wait outside, John. I want to stay with Daddy! [INTERPOSING VOICES] You can't take his daughter from here! Steve, I'm sorry. It's just that Leslie is determined to have her way! I want to say with Daddy! Come with me darling! Daddy! Come on! Daddy! I want to stay with Daddy! Come on! God, I'm so sorry! Oh, come on Becky. I had these bought especially for you. It's the kind the pop stars eat. I'm not hungry Grandma. I'm not hungry at all. Oh, but you're always hungry. Not today I'm not. And not yesterday either. And not yesterday either. Maybe some French toast. I'll have Cook make some up for you. Leslie, leave her be. She'll eat when she wants to. May I be excused from the table then? Yes. Yes, Becky. You may be excused. Well, what did you expect? All right fellas, this is great. I'll walk the of the way. - No, we're going to carry you! - Right. No. Got to be careful. No you won't. Listen you, careful. Whatever would give you that idea, huh? Just be careful. You'll do as you're told young lady. Eat your lunch. I'll do as I'm told, but I don't have to eat anything I don't like. Well, what do you like? I don't like anything right now. So I don't have to eat anything. [BEEP] Daddy! Maybe it's Daddy! [BEEP] Hello, Leslie Neumann. Oh, hello. It's the media. Tonight sometime. Goodbye. That was Daddy, wasn't it? No dear. That was not your daddy. I don't think your daddy can be bothered drinking. I don't think your daddy loves you any more. You're a wicked witch. And Becky? Yeah. She's sleeping, so I'm told. So you're getting the run around, huh? (QUIETLY) Yeah. We'll get her back for you Steve. (QUIETLY) Yeah. Harry, where did I find you? I found you, delirious. [GROAN] Let me help you. You need looking after. You do. [BEEP] LESLIE (ON SPEAKER): Yes? I'm here to see my daughter. LESLIE (ON SPEAKER): She's out. I'm sorry. Can I talk to John? LESLIE (ON SPEAKER): He's at the office. So who's out Becky then? LESLIE (ON SPEAKER): That's none of your business. She's just out. Leslie, don't do this to me please. Will you please let me see my daughter? LESLIE (ON SPEAKER): Look, I don't want Becky to see you. John doesn't want Becky to just see you. Won't be long before Becky won't want to see you. Please go away. You're not wanted here and you're not needed here. Goodbye. [BEEP] Steve, no. Think about it! Look, I'll back you in anything you want to set up! Don't go out there and kill yourself! Thank you but no thank you. Steve, why? But Becky well, I got into trucking so I wouldn't lose her. So I'm going to use what I've learned now to get her back. Tow trucking? Yeah. Pete and I, we've got our own business. I do the driving. He does the fixing. It's a job. It's an income. And it will give Becky back to me. Steve, are you crazy? Look, I got to do this my way for my own self-respect. You know, I'm sick and tired of being pushed around, being told what to do. Go here. Go there. Do this. Do that. I'll get out of trucking when I decide to get out. Nobody else. Well, don't come around looking for a nurse when your self-respect gets splattered all over the highway. I'm sorry you feel that way about it. [PFFT] You know Nelson's going to come looking for you as soon as he hears. I guess I'll just have to stay out of his way, won't I? Might you do that, because I don't want to have to tell Becky any bad news. You understand? You're not getting any second thoughts about this, are you Pete? You know me better than that, Steve. We made a deal! (QUIETLY) Yeah, yeah. [FIRE SPARKING] [BUZZING] [SAWING METAL] [WELDING] Every time I call, you tell me the same damn thing. I want to speak to Becky now! Put John on the phone. I want to speak to John. Is John there? Put John on the telephone now! [SLAMS PHONE RECEIVER] [BUZZING] [WELDING] [BUZZING] This place is better than I ever thought it could be. Congratulations! And you. Salut. [INAUDIBLE]! [LIQUID POURING] Ha! Ha! Go on [INAUDIBLE]. Accident reported near the junction of North Road and the Pacific Highway. Repeat, accident reported near the junction of North Road and Pacific Highway. [SQUEALING TIRES] Keep smiling, guys! Hey partner! Hey! Keep this up, we're going to have to expand! Really stupid. I'm just going to call him and that's it. What am I so afraid of? That he's not going to want to talk to me? I can handle that. Besides, I want him. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? [EXHALES] You're such a chicken. I am such a chicken. I don't believe I just did that. He's got to be listening in. We'll just have to give him something he can listen in to, huh? [MUSIC PLAYING] [CRASHING VEHICLE] That's right. That's right. Just a few more months, huh? I'm afraid so. The cancer is spreading rapidly from your lungs to the rest of your body. Doctor, I thought I came in here for cracked ribs. Radiation or chemotherapy? Doc! You are not microwaving me! I ain't a vegetable. I ain't going to be preserved with no chemicals. I am going with my boots on. And I ain't going to go alone. You were right, you know? I did want to get even. Well, I know that. It's not good to let it stew, but I'll let you try. It was good for business, though. Yeah, they're going to try to get even now. Part of me wants him to try. And that's real scary, because I'm beginning to like it. What you need is a good-- here, give here a try. I won't miss her. I get a lot more. I'm sorry. I forgot you have a woman. I had-- had a woman. Oh! Forgot all about her, have you? Hi Harry. How are you? Still in one piece, I guess. Steve. Ah ha. Mm. [GASPS] What's wrong? Are you alive or what? Let's go. All right. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Yes, he's here. Who is it? I don't know. Yeah? I'm going to be brief. If you know return her in a half hour, I'm going to call the police. Are you talking about Becky? Don't play games with me! I know you've got her! He said he'd take her! Are you saying she's missing? She's got a key. I thought she might have gone home! (QUIETLY) Becky. Becky, oh my God. Daddy, I've been waiting for you to come home. Sweetheart. Sweetheart. Don't squeeze me too hard. I'll be sick. [KISSES] Well, thanks for letting us know. Let me have that. Look, I'm not as gullible as some people. Found her? You took her. She'd say anything if you put her up to it. Ooh. Why men leave home. [VEHICLE ENGINE] [CRASHING] [SCREAMING] [PHONE RINGING] Yep? Leslie and I have been talking, Steve. And it seemed to us that if Becky ran away from here to you, that has to tell us something. And it's my thinking that perhaps it's time for us just to start being contented with being grandparents. Becky was-- was never really very happy. Not on a full time basis here. Well, does the grumpy grandmother go along with all this? She'll go along with it. Well, that's great John. I'll give you a call tomorrow when all the good news has finally sunk in. Goodnight. What was that all about? I think all of our troubles are over. Good morning! I'm up! So I see. What day is it? It's Sunday! You coming swimming? Mm, no. My heart's are already doing aerobics. Enjoy yourselves. - Goodbye Bye. Becky, you like Harry don't you? Why? Just wondering. Why? Why is it every time I ask you a question, I always have to answer it myself? You are older and wiser. I'm thirsty. Well, go get me something. Go on! Can I be bridesmaid? Better get out of here, you little boomer! Now I'm be Daddy and you be Mommy. Would you like a beer? Yes, please? What's for dinner? Something yummy? All they had at the shop was chocolate cookies. I'm worried about my figure. Have you thought about Weight Watchers? You know, I couldn't get the stains out of my washing today. Do you think you're using the wrong powder? [SLAM] Mm! [INAUDIBLE] Heard the girl talking to him! Let's go! - Go! Go! Go! Dad! Dad! [CRASHING] Dad! Dad! Help! Help! Dad! [CRASH] Becky! - - - z Please help! [EVIL LAUGHTER] [CRASH] Dad! Daddy! Dad!

Dammit! Let me go! [CRASH] [EXPLOSION] [CRASH] Steve! Steve! Becky's all right! She's going to be all right! (QUIETLY) She is. Steve! [THUMP] Harry! What the hell do you think you're doing? Bastards! [FIST FIGHTING] I guarantee you, you are going to listen to me now, old man. [AGONIZING SCREAMING] [GRUNT] [CRASH] [GRUNT] [CRASH] [GRUNTING] [CRASH] [GRUNT] [CRASH] [GRUNT] [LEAKING FLUID] [COUGHING] [THICK LAUGH] [CLICK] [LEAKING FLUID] [EXPLOSION] [YELLS] [GRUNT] Come on, Pete.
