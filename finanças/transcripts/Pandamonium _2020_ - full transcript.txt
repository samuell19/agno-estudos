Does this mean I've got the job? Welcome to Killmore & Percival, Legs. Morning, Mr. Daniel. Where you heading to this morning? Ah, moving up in the world, Mr. Daniel. That's what I like to hear. Security Steve, who's that? That's the new office junior. Not sure they're allowed to be called that anymore, mate. It's 2016, Mr. Daniel, no one's sure of anything. You see that thing up there? Allow me. Level three? I don't know, maybe. It says on your pass. I guess it does. First day? That obvious, huh? I'm six. Oh, by the way... Shit. I was about to say a jolt on level two. Thanks for the heads up. I guess this is me. See you around, six. Oh, watch out for Carol. All right, Danny boy. Confident, charming, funny all at once. You've got this. Hi, you must be Damian. I've just transferred up from level one, IT Department. Stop, name? Daniel, Daniel. Okay, Daniel Daniel, you know how to set up completion right? Yeah, of course, of course, sir. See that pile of shit in there? I need all that shit signed off and on my desk by 5:30. - Yeah, but... - 5:30. But it's my first day. I don't give a fuck! Damn it, motherfucking cocksucking piece of shit machine. Fucking goddamn it, piece of shit. Uh, excuse me? Oh, hello there, dear, how can I help? I'm Arielle Walters, I'm the new girl. Oh yes, Mr. Hook said you'd be coming. I'm Carol. I think I'm meant to file these. Yes, you'll want to do those at the same time as the others. Others? They want me to file all of these? Yes, it is quite a lot, isn't it? The girl before you left a lot of it. Come to think of it, so did the girl before her and the girl before and the girl before her. Why is that exactly? Well, they don't exactly make life easy for the young, attractive juniors around here. They? The boys up on six. Hi, Mr Hook. Shut your cake hole, Carol, and get back to work! You, Legs, make some coffees and bring them up to the board room, would you? Well, I was just... I wasn't asking. What a fucking asshole. I know, he's so sexy. Come in. You wanted to see me, sir? Damian, my boy, take a seat. Can I ask what this is about, sir? I'm afraid I have some rather dreadful news. Well, what is it, sir? One of my fellow senior partners, Phil Tanterton, was found dead last night. A dreadful, nasty business. Cut from ear to ear they told me. That is awful news, sir. Bloody terrible mess. Found with some young strumpet in his own home no less. Do they know who did it, sir? No, not the foggiest. Reckon it could be a robbery gone wrong. Does anyone else know about this, sir? Oh no, just you so far and the other partners. If this got leaked to the press, it would be pandemonium. Then why are you telling me, sir? Well, every cloud and all that poppycock. It means that we have an opening. For senior partner? Well, that's the thing. Now I thought it should be one of you boys from level six. Wait, but I thought I was a shoe-in. Well now, my dear boy, fair is fair. Now I thought I'd check the figures tomorrow morning and see who's earned the spot the most. With the greatest of respect, sir, I think we all know that's me. Oh, you got nothing to worry about then, have you? Odd though, Accounts tell me that your numbers have been down lately. That's bull... That seems unlikely, sir. Numbers don't lie, Damian. If I were you, I'd make today count. And Damian. Yes, sir. Pass the message to the other boys, would you? Yes, sir, of course. Fuck! What'd the old man say, Damian? Nothing. Did he mention the promotions? No. Where are all the bear claws? He didn't. He didn't say anything, all right? Hey, how do you fellows feel about having one of our little gatherings tonight? A level six rager! - Yeah! - Yeah, come on! Let's do it! Booze? Of course. Coke? You bet. Birds. Like any of this would work without 'em. So it's settled then. I'll make the arrangements with Security Steve. Mr. Hook, I have the coffees that you asked for. Well, what you waiting for? Bring 'em in. Hey, who's this little princess then? Our new legal assistant, Arielle. Oh, like the mermaid. Or the washing powder. It's spelled differently. I like to think of it as interesting. I don't think he picked you for your name, do you? Now Dick, I'm sure she has all the skills. Whoa, well go on, give us a twirl. Well, go on, love, show 'em the goods. Okay, you can go now. Right, so drinks-wise, what we thinking? Beer, lager, tequila? Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Don't worry about it, you could've been a six-foot teddy bear and I still would've jumped. I mean, yeah, sounds terrifying. How's your first day going? Killmore & Percival everything you hoped it would be? You know I thought it would be a step up from my last job, but somehow it feels like they've hired off the sex offenders register. Thanks. Not you, I'm talking about the wolf from Wall Street and his merry men in there. How the hell did those guys get to where they are? It's like they still think it's the '80s. Classic bullies get the nerds to do all the work while they live it up being big shots. So wait, does that make us the nerds? I'd better get back. Try not to let them get you down. Us nerds are in this together. Good night. Good night, good night. Good night, Veronica. Level six. That's everyone, you guys are good to go. You sorted the girls? Sure thing, boss man. Easy money. And save. Jesus. Not quite, Daniel Daniel. What's that? The files you asked me to complete earlier. Gonna stick 'em in your office on my way out. Out? Oh, Daniel Daniel, the party is just about to start. I've got to get home. Home, what for, a TV dinner and a cry wank? I'd love to, but... Come on, Daniel Daniel, you want to fit in up here, right? I could stay for one. Oh, Daniel Daniel, up here we work and we play hard. Meet the playboys of level six. Hey! Shot? Thanks. So how are you enjoying your first day on level six, Danny boy? Yeah, it's great. Not used to the fast lane, huh? I guess I'd go for easy on my first day. We did, we did. Shh, shh. Hello, Dick's. Our cheese is made with real dick. Strong cheese please, just the way your sister loves it. Boys, boys, the girls are here. Good work, garcon, send 'em up. They're already fucking here, lads. Girls? Only in a loose sense if you catch my drift. Strippers. Not just strippers, Daniel Daniel. The finest strippers money can buy. Hey, you gonna let us in or what? It's freezing out here. You sure this is the right place? Yeah, I done a couple of solo jobs here before. Real asshole, scum-of-the-Earth types, but the money's good. Oh, someone's coming. Lazy asshole. Good evening, ladies. About damn time, do you know how cold it is out there? Nice to see you too, Jasmine. Are you coming? Sure. Wow. Let me guess, level four account guys again? Nope. Level five? Level six? Holy shit, the high-flyers. What's level six? Level six is like the top dogs around here. The fee earners, the ones that make the big bucks. One night on level six played right will set you up for a whole month, longer. How's that work? These guys will pay double, even triple the going rate for a dance. Start throwing in some extras, and you're looking at some serious bank. Wait, no one mentioned extras. You said this was a nice, easy, laid-back gig. Yeah, all you've got to do is lay back. You guys don't do that, do you? Depends on the man. And the money. Come on, let's go bankrupt these cocksuckers. Oh yeah, watch out for the jolt on two. Did you see Games of Thrones last night? Sky Plussed it. Are you ready? What? What the hell is that? What, you said come as a sexy cowgirl. We meant the wild west. Well, they had cows, didn't they? Oh for fuck's sake. Hey, hey, lads, someone's coming. And here we go. So boys, are you ready for some ludicrously expensive fun? Okay, almost done. What the hell? - Carol! - Oh, it's you, dear. What the hell are you doing? I'm just finishing up some work. No, I mean why are you jumping around like that? Oh, it's the lights, they're on timers. They've got motion sensors, but sometimes you have to give it a bit of welly. I see. They still got you working here at this late hour on your first day? Yeah, well I just have to run these upstairs, then I'm free to go. So what are they doing up there? It's one of their private parties. They have them sometimes. They can get a little wild. Sometimes I like to watch them on the security cameras. Okay, that got weird quickly. I'm just gonna run these up there, okay? Oh, tell Damian I'm down here all alone if he needs anything. Yeah, sure thing. And run. Run you, you class A bastard! But you can't hide from the prankster. You can stop him. You didn't see it, Jerry. You killed my friends, and now I've come to kill you. Introducing Meredith Mayweather. I can fight. Good on you. Okay, let's see how this party's gettin' on. I think you'll find that the joke's on you. A little tame boys. I'd expect better. Level six. Okay, wild boys, that's everyone. Just gonna take a quick sweep of the floors. Gee, thanks Mr. Expedition. Just make sure no one disturbs us, yeah? You're the boss. Not yet. I'm sure you'll a kick out of this one. And only one shall survive. April Fools, motherfucker. April Fool, motherfucker. Hey, man, sorry I thought everyone was out. Hey, man, what the hell are you wearing? Hey, buddy, I'm talking to you. Hey, I said... Oh, I'm sorry. Hey buddy, what the... Sometimes I just lose control. The things you have to do to get your foot in the door. Oh, good, the show's just starting. Oh, you are naughty boys. I bet you're gonna show them what for. Now where is my sexy man Oh, Mr. Damiam, where are you? Oh Carol, you silly bitch, don't let them find you in here. They'll string you up if they... Goddamn motherfucking piece of shit in a crapping basket. Oh, hello. Damian, is that you? Oh, I knew, I knew there was something between us, and I knew you felt it too. I like the mask, it's very S&M. I like to be strangled myself. Duly noted. Now now, don't get all choked up. All right, cupcake, 100 quid if I can do you in the bathroom. Ew, no. Prude. All right, sweet cheeks, 200 quid if I can do you in the bathroom. Maybe later, sweetheart. Psst, Jas. One minute. Fuck, Cindy, stage names only. Right, fuck, yeah. Well, what do you want? We don't actually have to fuck these guys, do we? Who wouldn't want to fuck these charmers? Look, the beauty of this job is you can get as much or as little as you want to out of it. It's your body to do what you want with. Just don't let anybody try and make you do anything you don't want to do. And if they do, they'll have me to answer to. You're one of the girls now, Cindy. Okay. You good? Oh, remember try and have some fun. Told you lads. To the birds, yeah? What about you, handsome? Fancy a dance one on one? I promise I can be quite a handful. Not for me, love. Did I hear you could be quite a handful? You did. Daniel Daniel, what's going on? We got some prize cows here, literally. And you're just standing around looking at your trotters. It's just not the kind of thing I'm used to. You're playing with the big boys now, Daniel Daniel. You need to learn to loosen up. None of these girls doing it for you? All done, Mr. Hook. All... Oh, we're just having a party here, Legs. You should join us. I told you, my name is... Arielle? Oh fuck. What the fuck are you doing here? - I... - Hang about. How do you know Legs here? We used to work together. Well, now I work here. As what? As an ass... Hang on a minute. You mean, she used to work with you doing this. Yeah. Oh hi, Arielle. Oh my God, this is too amazing. Which one were you? What? The village girls here. Which one were you? The biker. The biker, the biker. I just don't believe it. I tell you what, why don't you show me and the lads here some of your moves? You seriously left us for this? Now now, better to be an office whore than a paid one. Arielle, wait. Bye, Arielle. Look, Pocahontas, it's your last chance, yeah? 400 quid for a quickie in the bathroom, yeah? Come on, come on, come on. What the hell is wrong with this thing? Arielle, are you okay? What was that? A reminder, a reminder that I shouldn't have even tried. Is it true? That I used to be a stripper? Do you know why I took this job? Now I never gave a shit about what anyone thought about me or what I did for a living, not for a second. No, I didn't give a shit when the moms at school found out what I did for a job. No, I didn't give a shit when they stopped talking to me at the school gates. I didn't even give a shit when they started keying my car and dropping shit through my letter box. I did, however, give a huge shit when my little girl came home from school crying 'cause the other kids called her mom a whore. I never cared about what anyone thought about me until I saw my little girl ashamed of me for the first time. - I... - I thought that getting a respectable job would change things, but I can see the goddamn look on your face right now. No, it doesn't bother me. Bother you? Well, it doesn't get to bother you. What the hell is wrong with this fucking thing? Do you know what, Daniel? Fuck you, fuck them, and fuck this place. So much for we were in this together, huh? Goddamn it! All I wanted was a normal life. That's all I fucking... Hello? Security Stu? No. Scott? Oh, Steve. You lost? Calm down, Legs. It's Carol, she's... Annoying as fuck, I know. No, she's dead, and so is Security Simon. That's not right. Come on, love, enough of the wind-up. There is a guy in a panda mask, and he is killing people. You must take me for a right mug. I'm telling you the truth. If you just wanted to get me alone, you only had to ask. What, no, I'm telling you that there is a guy in a panda mask, and he's killing people. Look, this was bound to happen sooner or later. What is? You and me. So it can be a drunken thing, an office party at Christmas, or we can get it over and done with now. There is not enough vodka in this world. I find that hard to believe given your last job. I was a stripper, not a whore. Is there a difference? You're a fucking pig. Look, I know your type, Legs. And you all have a price, so how about we call yours your job. Now let's see how far up these legs go, yeah? Hey! You little fucking twat! What do you think you're doing? Okay, so we should probably go now. I'll be fired. I'm gonna lose the apartment, gonna lose the job. Not gonna get the car or the dental plan or, or... Daniel, there is a serial killer loose in the building. Sorry, what? There is a serial killer loose in the building. He killed Steve. No, not Steve. And Carol. Yeah. All right, now give me your phone. Give me your phone. It won't work, the roofs are lead-lined. We need to get out of here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's wrong? We need to get the others. Woo! Oh my God. What do you think you're doing? Just checking out the goods. Yeah, well eyes are for looking, buster. I've got money. And I've got boundaries. Well, what about you? No way, dude. We're not prostitutes, we're dancers. And not for that kind of money anyway. You take cards? And where am I gonna swipe that, my ass? Okay, okay, just gimme like 30 seconds. I doubt you'd last half that, hon. You weren't gonna fuck him, were you? Oh, probably not, but it's fun to watch them sweat. Anyway, it's 2016, of course we take card. Where were you keeping that? Are you enjoying yourself? Aye. Although I should be for 200 quid. Hey, dude. You haven't got like a few bucks I can borrow, do you? In a minute, mate, can't you see I'm busy? Oh man, these drugs are kickin' in. There's a massive looking panda in a suit over there. It's okay, mate, this coke's cut with all kinds of shit. I'm preparing to see the flying baby Jesus. Oh man, he's got a scary knife. Fuck, watch the teeth, love. You're supposed to be a profess... No. Who the fuck is this prick? Sorry, don't mean to cut things short. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. He's got blood all over my suit. This thing cost me 2,000 quid. You fuckin' prick, he loves that suit. I do, it's my favorite suit. Well, you're gonna have to pay for that. Yeah, looks like we're gonna take you to the cleaners. Uh, buddy? Your dick's out. Oh, fuck. Cheers, mate. No worries, man. Right, where were we? Oh, don't worry, I'm not even real. Sure. Okay. Or am I? So basically you just add a little bit of lemon juice, you rub it around the edge, and then the shower head cleans itself whilst you use it. Costs the price of a citrus fruit. But these big companies want you to spend all that money on their cleaning products, which is rubbish because... What's going on? Well, I don't want you to panic, but there might be a mad head with a panda mask with a knife offing people. Might be? Well, it could be these drugs. It's definitely not the drugs then. Is this like a normal stripper thing or... Like one in 10. When I say, go for the lift. Oh, don't leave now, Officer. I've been a really bad boy. Go! Come on, come on! Oh, it won't open. It needs a card key. My fingers! Aren't you dreamy? Can I get your digits? Aren't you happy to be meeting a genuine, card-carrying psychopath? Cindy, we need to run. Aren't you beautiful. Don't let it go to your head. Don't worry, you're next. I'll call the lift, you go get the others. I think we might be too late. What's wrong? The key card isn't working. So we're stuck. We're stuck. Oh my God, you're Arielle. We've got to get out of here. There's a psycho killer. Less to say. Run, run away! Oh, come on, you're just milking it now. Poca hot tits. How's that for a totem pole? Oh yeah, so good. Wick, whap, bap, mam. Oh, oh, Geronimo! Here you are. Go and get yourself something nice. I can see why they call you Dick. We're here to help. What happened to the lights? Arielle, what the fuck are you guys doing? Why are you guys hiding down there? Who the fuck is this idiot? We need to go. What, why? Hey, hey, who's got me vodka? Oh, big panda. Come on, wax on, wax off. Gimme the chop. You cut me dick off? I'm dickless? Bad panda. I hope you're really proud of yourself. I'm gonna go away and die now. What is this place? The executive boardroom. It's like the worst place we could be. No exits, and the only thing keeping that nutter out there is a fucking key card. Who the hell was that guy? Some kind of psycho. I gathered that, Einstein. I mean, what did he want? Jesus, Jasmine, I don't know. Maybe he wanted to treat you to a KFC and a night in a Travelodge. What the fuck do you think he wants? He's not here to, get down! Is he gone? Did he see? I don't think so, but it won't be long till he finds us. And he's got the only card that works. So what, we're just gonna wait here for him to come and get us? You got a better idea? Yes, I say we go and rush him. Are you a complete idiot? This guy is a professional killer, not a Dairylea triangle. He killed half the people in this office without any of us even noticing. Who the hell are you calling an idiot? I'm not the one walking around up here like I'm Pretty Woman. Do you have any idea what you look like? What because I tried to do something with my life rather than spend every day being treated like a slut? And they really treat you any differently up here. Was it really worth abandoning all of your friends for? You know what your problem is? You've always refused to embrace who you really are. Well, either way, we'd still be stuck here waiting to die. Maybe not. What do you mean? Store room, secure, locks only form the inside. Standard locks, not on the system. And there's a fire escape at the back. But to get through the exits, we need a security pass. True, but when the building systems come on in the morning, the fire escapes will be operational as normal. They open at 6:00 with the cleaners in about two hours. Okay, but you forgot one thing. We need a key card to get round the back in the first place. Yeah, how we gonna get in there without one of those cards? The vent system. It's small, but if we can get through, we can unlock the door from the other side. How are we supposed to get through there? Well, maybe not me, but... I seriously doubt it. These beauties are never gonna fit through there. What, no way. I have enough trouble with lifts, let alone crawling into that death trap. Well, we can all just wait here to get murdered. It's the best choice. It'll be easy, I promise. Just a few feet, let the rest of us through, and we'll wait there till morning. There is no way in hell that I'm... Piece of shit panda in the fucking office. Guys. Guys, come on, the door's open. Fuck. Jasmine. We really should've run out. Let her go. Oh, I don't think so. I've just completed the full set. Arielle, you don't understand it. Why are you doing this? Why does anyone do anything when they go to the office? Because they're paid to. Paid, by who? Damian, what the hell is... I told you Legs here wasn't that bright. It's a shame really. I was looking forward to having a bit of thigh candy at work every day. What the hell is going on here? Well, it came to my attention that I was gonna be passed over for my well-deserved promotion this morning. And I've gone to such an effort to open up a position on the partner's circle. Of course I didn't realize it was a numbers game. So I had to get creative. So I called our friend here to eliminate the competition. Wait, so you set this up for a fucking promotion? Maybe you're brighter than I thought. Why the hell did you hire us? Well, our friend here has a little condition for his services. I guess his kink is what do you birds like to be called nowadays? Exotic dancers or is that too '90s? I like to mix business with pleasure. The deal was he takes out my competitors, and I provide the entertainment. So all of us are just collateral damage? Business is war, and war has its casualties. Oh my God, you're the actual psychopath here. All right, enough flappin' your gums. You can kill the bitch now. We've met loads of assholes like you down at the club, haven't we Arielle? What are you on about? Guys with plenty of money to make up for their lack of other things. You know what else we learned? A swift kick in the nuts hurts like hell. Classic stripper move. We still got it. You fucking slags, I'll gut you myself! You just can't get the staff these days. We should run. Yeah. Jas! No! Run, you stupid bitch. Nice try, you piece of shit. But this place opens in an hour. It's gonna be flooded with people, and this is your only way out. Now wait just one minute. There's just one more thing we need to take care of. Daniel! You leave now, and your little boyfriend dies. You bastard, let him go! Stay in there, the building will be open soon. We'll see if Romeo here lasts that long. The master key opens the fire escapes. Just go. Your choice, Arielle. I'm so sorry. Ah, true love. I just have to wait until morning and then I'm home free. It's bear hunting season. Okay, that was lame. Yep, I am definitely going to die. Oh shit. Daniel, can you move? Have you got your pass? Yeah. Get to the lift and get out. No way. Hey, we're in this together. Come on, come on. Come on, get up, get up. Come on. Come on. Mind the job? I'd prefer if you both stick around. I fucking hate overtime. He's right, you know. Overtime can be such a killer. I don't know about you. But it's the assholes that get me. You girls are all the same. Always trying to cut and run. Well, now it's my turn to cut and run. Okay, we get the point. Fuck you, Chi Chi. Fuck. Going down? You know, I really admire you. You have a lot of guts. All the more to spill. I am going to set you free. There's something you should know. And what's that? The lift jolts on two. Don't worry, first day's always tough. Oh my God, what happened to you? Turns out this office has a panda problem. What do you mean? There's nothing there. Mother... Who the fuck is this? Motherfucker, this cost me 2,000 quid. Hey, Amber, come here and clear this up will you? Ugh, yes, Teddy. I like to mix business with pleasure.
