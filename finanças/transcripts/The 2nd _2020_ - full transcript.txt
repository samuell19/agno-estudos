Hello? Child, is that you? Yes, Father. I'm listening. I have great news. Today you will strike. Get your team ready. And my target? Senator Bob Jeffers. Make it messy. Our benefactors want to cause an outrage. I will not fail you. Go with God. God is good. BS! I call BS! BS! I call BS! Senator Jeffers, stop the madness. Senator Jeffers, they're sending in a Delta team to extract you. There's been a bomb threat. Really think you should leave the interview. Would you look at that? - I got it. All right. - Okay. Okay. You were saying, my dear? Aren't you nervous your presidential platform could crumble if the U.S. Supreme Court votes against the right to bear arms? That vote won't take place till after the election. And when I am president of this great United States of America, I will uphold individuals' rights to bear arms. Now, that's a right that was solemnly confirmed by the Second Amendment... ratified in 1791, by the way. This is not a real car. Why'd they give us this piece of shit? I feel like a damn clown in this thing. You know what I think? I think Mama fed you too well. Hey, I'm from Michigan. Us boys like our cornbread, a'ight? Shit. Didn't mean to turn the radio on, dude. I can't even hit the brake without hitting the damn radio. Oh, you think that's funny? That's funny? That was my request. I wanted to see you all cramped up in this thing. Yeah. Yeah, this is ridiculous. Wait, wait, wait. You're too tall, dude. - You're just too tall. - Oh, yeah. You're real funny. You know, you're the reason why my nuts are in my throat right now. Too bad. So apparently, this guy's sitting in an interview right now. Okay. And? Question is, which one of us gets to go in there and pull his crusty ass out of the chair? Okay, well, you know what? Seeing that you had your fun already, I'm thinking I should go in. Ah, nah. I'm gonna flip you for it. No. Not doing that, bro. I'm not doing that. Nah. Not doing it. - Too late. - Hold it up. Hold it up. Let me see. - Call it. - Heads. - Tails! - Shit. Come on, man. - No, no, no. - Yeah! Yeah! - All right. All right. - Tails. You a cheatin' motherfucker, you know that? You cheatin'. - Go have this one. - Oh, I will. Enough is enough! Enough is enough! So I acknowledge, support, and abide by our God-given right of self-defense against any and all enemies, be they foreign or domestic. You believe there's a domestic threat I should worry about? You don't have to puddle-jump to some godforsaken country to find someone willing to kill you under the guise of revolution. Now, if it was up to me, I would arm every man, woman, and child in this country who is a true patriot and defender of our constitution. And I would strike first. Sir, we gotta go. Now. Oh. All right. - Now, as I was saying... - We have a bomb threat. - Sir, we have to move. Let's go. - All right. When this is over, I'd like to see you again, though. Mm-hm. No. No. No, definitely not Benson. He's a pattycake. No, he's soft on security, soft on crime. He's a marshmallow son of a bitch. Couldn't win an election if it hit him in the face, okay? Alrighty, now, I gotta go. Bye. ...L.A. We recently discovered a report of a bomb threat made against Senator Bob Jeffers during a Second Amendment rally outside his Los Angeles office. He is an outspoken proponent of the NRA, and the frontrunning Republican candidate. The rally is in response to a school shooting that killed CIA director Mike Phillips's 12-year-old daughter Stephanie and nine other students. Director Phillips has become a vigilant spokesperson in support of gun control, stating he will do whatever it takes to stop the madness. Package is secure. Somebody want to tell me what the hell's going on? Your name is on a list, sir. What list? A list of dead politicians. Bunch of assholes. Next time I want the nice car. Low profile. We're rollin' low profile. John, remind me again, how long are we stuck on this detail? Four days, three swing states, two outdoor speeches. Yeah, and a partridge in a pear tree. I knew better than to answer your phone call. Pay's not bad. How's Shawn? Eh. He doesn't call much. He's busy with his... play. Ah. As in theater. Yep. Hello? Ahh! Damn! They're tracing your call! - Tracing who? - Get off the phone! Let's move! Just get behind me, and stay low. Aaah! Aaah! Keep moving! Aaaah! Get him out of here! Unhh! Unhh! Aaah! Unhh! Aaaah! Oh, shit! Unhh! All right, man, easy. Easy there. Your man for the senator. Take the shot, Vic. Take the shot, Vic. Let him go! Vic, take the shot. Vic, take the shot. Vic, you take that goddamn shot! No, Vic! The Supreme Court has returned to their homes around the country to celebrate Christmas with their families after four long weeks of hearing the case of Connor vs. Harper, a case that directly impacts the right to bear arms, and some say could change the Second Amendment forever. We expect to receive their opinion shortly after the holiday. Argh. Ohh. Damnit, not again. You sure you're up for this? Don't I look up for it? You really need all that stuff? I'm not taking Shawn to the cabin to sit for five days. Would that be so bad? What, so we can get in touch with how well we don't know each other? You know, I also lost my mom at a young age. It's not what he's doing that's important. It's who he's doing it with. You really are my better half. Better two-thirds. - At least. - Hmm. Do not forget to lock the house, even during the day. I won't. And set the alarm. Okay. Will you call me? Uh, yeah, but from Shawn's phone. Mine's acting kind of funny. Right. Bye. So how many Russians will you find in South Africa? If you're asking me if you are like any Russian I've met, you are one of a kind. You know how many South Africans there are in Russia? How many? - Three. - I believe it. It's too cold. Fencers ready. Allez. - Halt. - Come on. Fencers ready. Yeah. Allez. - Gotcha. - Come on. Yup. Okay. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Mm-hm. Fencers ready. Oh, yeah. Allez! Thanks. Lucky flick. Erin takes the last round of the semester! - Good job, girl. - Thank you. Thank you! That's it for class. Have a good break, guys. What are you smiling about? You lost. Did I, though? - All right, that'll be $85. - Pay up. You cheated. No, I hustled you. There's a difference. Pay the woman. Me? Yes. I'll get you back. Come on. All right, people! All right, let's go! All right. Okay, dorm is closed for the holiday season due to construction, so everybody out. Okay? I'm not saying you gotta go home, but you can't stay here. Hey. Hey. Um, when's your dad picking you up? Oh, Olivia said he broke his phone, so I guess when he gets here. How about you? Oh, he's way too busy with his opinion on the Second Amendment, so he's sending a driver. Right. That's a really big deal, right? Yeah. Like world-changing. Do you pay attention to anything? I, uh, I haven't talked to him in a couple weeks. Hey! You three all packed up? All packed and ready to go. Yeah. I mean, I'm like 80 percent there, but my car doesn't get here till 6:00. 5:00, Erin. 5:00 PM is the last person out. All right, well, I don't get to choose when the Secret Service comes to pick me up. Okay, you get a minor exception, all right, but you, - you're out, all right? - Of course. Thanks. You're the best. Yeah, don't forget to sign out with Charlie. - Uh-huh. - Hey, Erin. Maybe I could call you over the break? Sure, I guess. Cool. She's way out of your league, bro. I mean,. Hey! 5:00 PM! Out, all right? Not coming in. When you left, you can't come back in. That's it. Hey, hon. You're not there yet, are you? No, this traffic is just a nightmare... Watch it, dickhead! Sorry, sweetie. Well, they closed the dorm at 5:00. I told Shawn you're running late. Yeah, thank you. I'll call you as soon as I get there. Okay. Bye. Nice car. I'm here to pick up Erin Walton. I'm gonna need to scan your license. - Do we need to do this every time? - Nope. But you're not Ms. Walton's regular driver, and we have protocol. - I'm impressed. - I never forget a face. Make like Michael Jackson and beat it. So I need a huge favor. No. Thing is, I have to catch a flight to Calgary. Charlie. You don't have to keep pretending your Canadian girlfriend is real. Bro, do you want me to show you the Instagram messages? No. What do you need? So, I'm not supposed to leave until everybody's signed out. And everybody's gone except for you... and Erin. I see what you're doing, and no, she's on ice, dude. If I do one more thing, I'll come across desperate. "She's on ice"? Bro, come on. You owe me. 85 bucks. Okay. Fine. - Sweet. Thanks, man. - Yeah. Just leave this with Neal before you go. Sure. And don't cry when Erin lets you down, man. Like, she's political royalty. Put the cane down. Who the hell are you? The driver. Hey. How's it going? Um, I am here to check you out. I meant check you out of your room. Right. Yeah. Um, I need to finish packing and stuff, so... Well, you need to sign this. Yeah, we're actually the two last people in the building, I guess, so... Should I be worried? Why? No reason. Okay. Mission accomplished, cowboy. Hm? Oh. - Right, the, uh... - All of it. - The cowboy hat, right. - Yeah. Uh, I'm actually on the way to my cabin. Uh, it's, like, in the woods. We have dirt bikes and horses and a bunch of cool stuff like that. Oh, you have horses? Yeah. Yeah, two of them. I've never been horseback riding. What? Come on, never? No, never. Well, I mean... I don't know if you'd... you'd want to, but I... I could, uh... I could take you? Mayb... cool. - Sure. Yeah, maybe. Maybe. - Maybe. Um.. Yeah, here's this. I have to finish... - I need to finish packing, so... - Right. I'm just gonna go back and do it. Uh, Erin, actually, I have to make sure you leave safely before I can go. Okay, um... I just... I'm sure you have something better to do than just sit here and wait for me. No. I don't. Okay, well, um... maybe could you help me pack? Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Let's do it. - Great. - Yee-haw. Giddyup, partner. Nice getup. Janitorial technician. Make sure our asset's on her way out. Yes, sir. Campus is closed. I'm here to pick up my son. - Where? - MacArthur Hall. Hm. Why don't you call your son, have him meet you over there? Um... - My phone is... - Ah. Eh, I'll tell you what, make it quick, will you? Yes, sir. And you and your son, you have a merry Christmas, sir. You do the same. One coming your way. Is he a problem? Nah, he's just here to pick up his son. Should be quick. Okay, everyone stay loose till this guy's gone. You were aware this dorm has a perfectly good elevator? I don't do elevators. Childhood trauma? Claustrophobic. Oh, so repressed memory, then. What are you, a psych major? No. Theater. - You got it? - Yeah. We have the asset. Wow. Nice car. - Secret Service. - Okay, okay. Pretty cool. Here, let me get that for you. I got this. Here you go, sir. Sorry. Um, well, thanks for everything, and merry Christmas. - Yeah. Yeah, merry Christmas... - Shawny! - Hey! - How you doing, bud? Um, you should call me. Uh, yeah. Yeah, I will. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. - How you been? What's up? Hey, you're good. You know, I'll take a few hours late over not at all any day. Hmm. That hurt. Sorry. Is that your girl? Uh, no, it's Erin Walton. Walton. Yeah, Justice Walton's daughter? Like Supreme Court Justice Walton? Yeah, Dad. Where's Steve? - Sick. - Oh. Shit. Hold on. I'll be right back. - Hey, where you going? - I'll be right back! - Wait, where you going? - Oh, I-I forgot my laptop. The new guy's an ass, so... I'll be quick, I promise. All right. Okay, so what's up? I, uh, I promised Charlie that I'd make sure everyone was out, so I gotta... I gotta stay. Okay. The asset is on the move. Heading to her room. Ready to do some ridin'? Uh, it's a little chilly, nah? Fishing'll be good. Eh. Well, I know you want to shoot. - You love to shoot. - I mean, I would, I just... got tryouts for the play in a couple weeks, so... gotta start going over the lines, get the part. What's the play? Lost in Yonkers. Ah, yeah, right, that's... It's Neil Simon. Neil Simon, uh, is the guy who... Write. Writes. How's your bike holding up? Oh, good. Yeah, she's good. Needs a carb tune-up, but, uh... Oh! Thanks for reminding me. Gotta cover her up. So you're sure you're still all in on this theater thing. Uh, yeah, Dad. If you'd actually been around last couple years, you'd know I was good at it. I don't get to decide when I come and go, Shawn. That's part of the deal. Yeah, Dad. I know the deal. Don't get to choose. Don't need it. All right? I'm fine. Seriously. Your friend say her driver's new? Yeah. So? Who's left inside? It's just the two of us. We're the last ones in. Here. Take the keys, get in the Jeep, lock the doors, and do not move. Is something wrong? I don't know. Just chill. I'll be right back. Chill. "Just chill." Chill. Who taught him that word? Papa Bear's headed inside. Keep your eyes on him. Yo, Charlie. What up? Yeah, I told you. Can't just come on that strong. Gotta let her cool off a little bit. God, you scared me. Sorry. Did you say your driver was new? Yeah. Why? Maybe we should call your dad and make sure. Got your phone? Yeah. Shawn said you're a Green Beret? Delta Force? Yeah, I am. Make the call. - Hello? - Daddy? Erin. I thought you'd be here by now. Where are you? Well, I had a lot to pack. She's called her father. Kill the call now. We have dinner reservations at 9:00. When will you be home? Before then, I guess. Hey. Can you ask about the driver? Sure. Um, Dad, uh, did you send a new driver? A new what? Driver. No. The call dropped. I know. I know. That whole class was B.S. Hello? Charlie. Well, what did he say? He said no. Kill the lights. - Get down. - What? Get down now. Oh. Okay. What is going on? Okay. Follow close and avoid the windows. - What about my bag? - Leave it. That's strange. Erin just called asking about her driver. And? The line went dead. Promise me you're not going to ruin another holiday season. Me? The both of you need to leave your politics at the office. I'm calling again. Probably met a boy with dozens of tattoos and fell in love. I am not playing referee this holiday. Voicemail. Her battery is dead. Have you finished your opinion? I'm undecided. This is not a time for neutrality. You pick a side, and you stand by it. Dad? Ma'am. Yoo-hoo! The asset is gone. Move in now. Contingency Delta. Full extract. There's a structural interference. Wait. They're on level four. Acquire the package. Create rows. Maintain a perimeter. No one in or out. What about Papa Bear and Baby Bear? Expendable. Now we have ourselves a little party. How excitin'. Stay on target. We have a job to do. All right, come on. Stay low. Come on. Okay. I'm gonna need you to stay right with me, like step for step. We're gonna move quickly and quietly, okay? Okay. Dad? Is everything all right, Ms. Walton? Fine. Do you need help finding your laptop? Nope. I'm good. We're running a little behind schedule. Actually, I'm not on any particular schedule. Beg your pardon? Not to be a bitch, but I don't remember telling you that I needed to be anywhere at any certain time. I see subterfuge is pointless. Put the asshole on the phone. Now. Yeah? You've become quite an obstacle, mister. But we're working on that. But I can assure you, you're surrounded by a team of highly trained operatives. All signals... wi-fi, radio, CB... have been jammed. I'm giving you five minutes to exit the building. It may not seem like an act of kindness, but I promise you, it most certainly is. You should have had your package and been out in two. Fuckin' amateur. What'd he say? We gotta get you out of here. Okay. Excuse me, sir. Uh, have you seen, like, a middle-aged guy around here, bad clothes, doesn't smile much? Ring a bell? Sorry, bubba. But I can help you look if you like. Oh, no, that's okay. I don't want to take you away from your work or anything. - Don't worry about it. - Work's not going anywhere. Cool. Sorry about this. You probably must be antsy to get out of here. You know, bubba, I mean, I can't complain. Guess if I would have gone to college like you, maybe I'd be a big shot, not a toilet scrubber. Know what I'm sayin', bubba? Yeah. I guess. Goddamn it, Shawn, I told you to wait in the car! You know, one of these days, you're gonna realize when I tell you to do something, I'm not sayin' it just to hear myself ta... What? You just killed that guy? He was gonna kill you. Look, he's not dead. Ohh. Let's go. Okay. All right, go on, go. Justice Walton. Pardon me, sir. Director Phillips is here. He says it's very urgent to speak with you. Show him in. Very good. Do you think this has anything to do with the decision? Probably. Ohh. That poor man. - Thank you. Eva. - Hi, Mike. Ken. Terribly sorry to intrude like this. Aw, merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Thank you. A man carrying a bottle of Macallan's is never an intrusion. Grab a cue. Guests always break. Well, it's been quite a while. I'm not sure if I remember how this goes, but... I'll give it the old college try. Lucky shot. You're not the first shark at my table. Well, get to it. I'm guessing you didn't fly in from Washington just to keep me company. Your opinion. Is it done? I have a draft. You want to see it? Yes, I-I would. Maybe we should play by the rules. Hi. Cheers. Thank you. Thank you, darling. To better, more responsible times. I'll drink to that. Listen, Ken, have you ever read Those Who Walk Away from Omelas? It's a short story by Ursula Le Guin. Can't say that I have. There's this town, Omelas, where everybody's happy. Not happy. Ecstatic. There's no soldiers, no kings, no inequality. It's a Utopia. And... well, there's no monsters who walk into preschools with assault rifles. But there's a catch. In order for this... Utopia to exist, an atrocity has to be committed. This is part of the deal. Some of the townspeople go along with it, and some don't. And what is it they have to do? They have to hurt a child. I have your daughter, Ken. I have Erin. If you don't do what I tell you to do... something terrible will happen to her, and it will be your fault. It's your shot. Go, go, go. Get down, get down. All right. I've got to find a landline. There's people I can call in a situation like this. There's a payphone in the gym. You sure? I've never seen a payphone in there before. Yes! Freshman year, we had a petition to get... Guys, guys! That's where I'm headed. Give me your cell phones. - Why? - 'Cause they're tracking them. How do you know? Sorry. - All right... - Dad! - We're going with you. - No, no. These people are highly trained. Yeah, well, so am I. Well, then take this. Here. You guys stay out of sight, listen for sound, but do not engage. They need Erin alive, but you and I, they'll shoot on sight. - Okay, we won't go anywhere. - Yeah, we'll stay hidden. - Okay. - Dad. You're gonna need this. It's a payphone. Yeah. Here. I'll be back for mine. Cellphone GPS says they're on the elevator heading to the ground floor. I'm on it. This kid thinks he's smart. Smarter than you. Let's take a ride. On your knees! Put the cuffs on, put your hands over your head. Now! Paula, how we lookin' up top? Dead still, baby. They're zipped up tight. Babcock, what's your 20? I'm playing hide-and-seek. Rodriguez, report. Rodriguez, report. Driver, you gotta see this! All ears, listen up. His name is Major Vic Davis. Green Beret at 21, Delta Force a few years later. He's seen action all over the world... Bosnia, Somalia, Kosovo. If there was a major conflict in the last 15 years, this guy was there. He's the current Delta One team leader. In Somalia, his confirmed kill count was over 50. Deadly, and he will not hesitate to kill you. Did you know all that? Nope. I don't care who you are. You're dead. They seem really nervous about it. Yeah. Yeah, they should be. Oh, my gosh. Shawn, you're bleeding a lot. - It's not that bad. - No, no, we need to get this wrapped up. - I-I'll be okay. - No, it's bad. It's not... it's not that bad. I'll be okay. No. Come on. Let's find something. We'll wrap you up. Hey, this is Vic. I've got a domestic terror situation, Macarthur Hall, Johnson College. They're everywhere. Major Davis, I'm hardly paramilitary. Try harder. - CIA? Ground Branch? - Good guess. Now do you understand what you've gotten yourself into? I give you this one-last-time offer to leave and never look back. Take it. No. This is my way, you bitch. Fuck! Stop! Does that hurt? But... go ahead. We used to go to the cabin all the time. You know, it was kind of like our thing. Mixed martial arts, hand-to-hand, sharpshooting, dirt-biking. It's kind of like what my dad's best at. That's cool. And I really loved it, too. Not what we were doing, just... just that we did it together. So, uh, are your parents together, then, or... where's your mom at? Sorry. Some asshole from Iraq... he wanted revenge for something my dad did. And, um... they found our house. But I was at school. And, um... ...he killed her. God damn. So, my dad stopped coming home so much, and, uh, I started to live with a lot of military families. And then I went to college. We haven't spent much time together since she... Shawn, I'm so sorry. Yeah. Thank you. For what? You waited for me. I find nothing. No asset. Nothing. Keep sweeping, all floors. Be realistic, Erin. If you come out now, we will let your friends go. Keep resisting... and we will have to kill them. You are not that selfish. Are you? Stay the fuck away from me. Hello, sweetheart. The gun! Hey! This is why... you don't interfere... in other people's... Aaaahhhh! Ohh! Stupid suka! Hey! Let her go... or I'll kill you. Fucking do it! Think real hard, little boy. Once you cross that line... ...there ain't no goin' back. Come on. - Hold this. You okay? - Yeah. Let's go, come on. They'll declare my judgment was under duress, and they'll toss it out, doing you a damn bit of good. My daughter didn't have a choice when that monster shot her. But you have a choice tonight, Ken. I just hope you make the right one. You deviate from my instructions just once, and Erin dies. You got it? Don't fuck with me, Ken. I didn't get to be Director of the CIA without making sacrifices. Even men like you can disappear. This'll be our dirty little secret. There, there, there, there. Shit. Damn it! Come on! It's open! Go in! Go, Erin! - Shawn? - Yeah. I'm really scared. Papa Bear is on the north side of the dorm. Visual acquired. Copy that. Paula, engage and eliminate. I don't have a shot. There's a fuckin' tree! Krieg, Rose, move it! Do you have a shot? Negative. Clear target. Permission to engage. Granted. Tango down. That's bullshit, okay? She's lying. Okay, she has to be lying. Mnh-mnh. Krieg, confirm he's dead. Yes, sir. I can't let them hurt you. We're gonna get out of here, okay? I promise you. No, that's not a promise that you can make. I'm so sorry. Okay, I'm sorry. I have to go. I'm sorry, just stay here. Just stay here until we're gone, okay? Erin, no! Erin, no, wait! Believe it or not, we're the good guys! Hey! I'm what you want, right? Come and get me! I'm giving myself up! Hey, pretty young thing. Hey. We need you alive... but not necessarily in one piece! You are gonna spend the rest of your life wishing you hadn't fucked with us! Hey! Step away. Kid, you better use that thing before I get up and kick your ass. You guys okay? - You okay? - Dad! Vic! Here! You all right? We heard you were dead! No, they just gave me a workout. All right. Let's get out of here. Yeah. Hold it. Stop! Hands up! Please don't shoot! Please! Okay? - Neal? - Erin? Where have you been? We're under attack. Under attack? What are you...? Bullshit! Did you not hear the gunfire? What gunfire, where? What do you mean? - Snipers on the roof... - You could have died! Guys, focus! - You, what... - Neal. Neal, is there a way out of here, a hidden exit? Yeah, there's a, uh, an old service tunnel between here and the main building. - How do we get there? - Actually, it's, uh... there's an old elevator right, right this way. All right, let's go. Come on. Right through here. Come on, go, go, go, go, go. - Ooh! - Hang on! Go! Come on, Neal! You guys get in that elevator and get the hell out of here! Whoa! Go, go, go, go on! Open the door! Come on, Neal, open the door! Okay! Go! Go, go, go! Come on, come on, come on! Shawn. Get in the elevator, come on! - Shawn! - I can't leave my dad! - Come on, Shawn! Shawn! - Just go with Neal! Goddamn it, Shawn, I told you to go! No man left behind, right? I lost you once tonight. It's not happening again. I'm sorry, Erin, this isn't my fault. What are you talking about? No. No, you son of a bitch! No, no, no, no! I'm really tired of chasing you around. Ohh! Damnit! You said payment upon delivery. So I'll take my cash and I'll leave. You know, three people can keep a secret... Aaah! ...if two of them are dead. Aaahhh! - Please don't. - Neal! No, Neal! Take care of the rest. What are you... what are you... What are you doing? What is she doing? Get off of me! Shawn! Shawn! Look out, please! Run! Shawn! Shit! Come on! No! No, please, stop! No! No! Dad! Dad! Please! Ow! Ow. Shawn. Shawn! Shawn! Shawn. Shawn! Shawn. Are you okay? - Are you okay? - Dad. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Yeah. Let me get you up. Come here. Thank God you're okay. - We gotta get out of here. - Yeah. - You all right? Can you walk? - Yeah. - All right. - Let's go. All right, come on. Ya know, I'm thinkin' about retirin'. Really. So, what then? I don't know. Finish the cabin. Fish. Not get shot at. Honestly, I was thinkin' we could make up for lost time. Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that. Shawn! There's a sniper! Aaaaah! Help! Shawn! Come on! Shawn! Ohh! Shawn! Help! Come on! Come on! It's time to go. Move it! What about the kid? Kill him! Sorry, mate. Nothing personal. Uhh! Unhh! Aaah! Help! Shawn! Shawn! - Aaah! Uhh! - Aaaah! I don't believe! He is on roof! Aaaah! Now! Shoot him! There! Shoot him! Huh? What is going on? Shoot! Watch where you're driving! Idiot. Uhh! Ohh! Run him down! I am running down! No! Unhh! Ohh! Yahhh! Unhh! Unhh! Aaah! Ohh! Please stop! - Arrghhh! - Get him! Unhh! Unhh! Unhh! I ate a man in gulag! Uhh! Makes it seem like kindness compared to what I do to you! Aaaah! Dad! Ahh. Aaaah! Shawn! Shawn! The Supreme Court has indicated that a decision has been made, and the justices are finishing their opinions. They will deliver their judgement tomorrow at 8 a.m., Eastern time. Who the hell is he? I lost... a lot of good people tonight. Uh... Implicating me with an unknown third party was not part of the plan. His father is a Delta team leader. Major Vic Davis? And where is he now? Maybe dead. Maybe not. Insurance policy. What about your mess at the school? Cleaning crew. And you're sure that Walton... did what I asked? Doesn't matter. It matters to me. ...unconfirmed source says that Justice Walton has submitted his judgement against the Second Amendment. There are times when one must sacrifice a few in order to save the many. We all have callings. I need you to drown the girl and put her body in the boat. Get rid of the boy. Come on, baby doll. Let's have some fun! - No, hold on... Stop! - Shawn! Sit. Put your hands up. - He's clean. - All right, let's go. Hey, wait! Looks like your insurance policy's about to pay off. I'll handle this. Aaaah! Uhhh! Aaaah! Uhhh! Aaaah! Uhh! Aaah! Ohh! Uhh! Ohhh! Aaaaah! It's too bad we didn't meet under different circumstances. Could've been friends. Unhh! Aaaaah! Unhh! Might I suggest you let me pass? We're fighting for the same thing. Duty, Vic. To country. To your family. It's what we fight for, and I have a duty to follow my orders. It's simple. You and me are gonna go on a little boat ride, love. Ohh! Ohh. Ahh. Unhh! En garde, bitch. Stay back. You're not the first one to wave a sword at me, love. I'm warning you. I know how to use this thing. Yahh! Brat! Yahh! Ahh! Oh! This. Is. Not. Fair! Aaaah! Aaah! Aaah! Hyahh! Hyahh! Aaah! Ohh. You know, I was supposed to drown you. That's what I have to do. Hey. Hey. Are you okay? Are you okay? I'm sorry. I just... I'm really happy we're alive. Yeah, me too. - Are you okay? - I think so. I'm okay now. Erin! Dad. Erin. Oh, Dad. Oh. Unhh! Aaaah! Ahhhh! Aah! Aaaah! I gotta... I gotta go help my dad. That's far enough, Judge. Let it go, Phillips. It's over. You're not the one calling the shots here. Director Phillips! You have three seconds to put the gun down. What's your play? Huh? You gonna execute the Director of the CIA of the United States of America? Yes. Two... one. You think this ends here? I'm just the tip of the spear. - I'm so glad you're okay. - Me too. Ow! My arm! Genevieve? Are you here? You survived. That's good. Drink? History won't be kind to you, Mike. And that's... unfortunate. Our benefactor is worried that Walton will talk? Because I can assure you, he won't. And he won't change his judgement, either. He knows I'm watching. And he's afraid. All of this will be... our secret. Mike.... three people can keep a secret... ...if two of them are dead. Hey. What time is it? Past six. What's up? Are you okay? Did I ever tell you how I got this watch? I always figured you just took it off some dead terrorist or something. I-I'm just kidding. How'd you get it? President Clinton awarded my entire unit the Medal of Honor in '97. - What? - Yep. Holy shit. You got the Medal of Honor? How did I not know about this? It's classified. So the president goes down the line, by the time he gets to me, they're a medal short. But the president, without missing a beat, he takes off his Rolex... this Rolex... and he hands it to me. He says, "I can't have a man showin' up for the Medal of Honor "and leavin' my office empty-handed. "I want you to wear this watch and remember the lives you saved." Son... once you take a life, you never sleep quite the same way again. You're not really the same guy anymore. So I'm gonna tell you what President Clinton told me. When you wear this, I want you to think about the lives you saved... not the ones you took. All that time you were gone... I want you to know there wasn't a day that went by where I wasn't proud to be your son. I always meant to tell you that. I'm proud of you, too. - Thanks, Dad. - Okay. All right, that's enough of the mushy stuff. Who wants a drink? Um, I think so. - Yeah? - Yeah. I'm gonna leave you two kids alone. Hi. So... Oh, uh, Dad. Yeah? Merry Christmas. Thanks, son. Merry Christmas, young lady. Merry Christmas. Who's the lucky guy? Stop! I see the meds are kickin' in. - Oh, my goodness, it's a twist-off. - I know, what can I say? Mr. Vic Davis. You ready to pay your dues? Oh, Vic!
