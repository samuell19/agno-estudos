And when you tell this kind of story... everybody who comes to hear it wants to own it 'cause it's gay. It's the kind of story rarely ever heard, at least in this forum. You've just got so many factions and groups to please and satisfy... and it just doesn't work that way. Forget the right altogether. Facts is facts. There's always gonna be some gayJoe from some square state... from some square town who can never be made happy. Yee-ha! Yee-ha! He missed the point altogether... though he's not as bad as those political dudes screaming in New York City. You boycott! You boycott! Boycott this fucking film! Here we have a film about Provincetown. Provincetown! It's a fuckin' gay ghetto, you morons! A place where vapid people go to escape... to fuckin' hide! So what? So they can hold hands with their lover on the street... without being bothered, where they can feel safe. When what they should be doin' is staying at home... in their own cesspool city of homophobia... fighting for the right to hold hands... on every goddamn street in the country. You morons! Boycott! Boycott! Boycott this fucking film until the country has changed! - The fucking world! - That's right! - And what about women? - That's right! - [Yelling] - Really, the worst? Every guy I've talked to only wants to see one thing. I wanna see some dick. - You, come back to work! - Hang on a second. Big dick, man. Are you gonna show it? 'Cause I'm sick and tired of getting gypped. Taxi! All these guys want porno when they go to see a film like this. I want it hard too. And they wait for it, to the last frame. Get one this big, and then go for the close-up. And have some guy going down on it... all the way down until he chokes. Yeah! 'Til he chokes with pleasure. Where's the black one? So fine, we'll just give it to him. Let's just have some dick. [Sighing] So, now we can digest the film. My summer. My balls. I put a condom on so I wouldn't give myself Al DS. ##["Unspellable Punk Song"] You've heard this before, right? It's... sort of a joke. It goes: How come dogs lick their own balls? 'Cause they can. And you see, my definition of a hero... in tragic Greek terms... is that of someone who dies trying to lick his own balls. In a comedy it's the definition of a fool. My friend John says we need more heroes and less fools... but the thing is is that most people are neither. Most people go around licking other people's balls. And me? I just spent an entire year licking the pavement, the dirt. And I'm not gonna get detail oriented... but I've been working hard for a long, long, long time... and then suddenly everything went moot. And then I was... [Chuckles] Well, you'll find out. I was surviving in a most humiliating way... in a state of sheer depression and going out a lot... but it wasn't lifting my spirits. 'Cause, you know, it's one thing to go out and have a good time... but it's another thing to go out and then feel guilty about going out... because, really, you should be staying at home and working on your future... and not sleeping in 'til 2:00 p.m. And waking up with a hangover; and therefore accomplishing nothing, not the good time or the future. What do you do in a situation like this? You let go, or go crazy. My philosophy: For one summer in your life, you just enjoy. Do something you haven't done yet... before it's too late. Just be gay, be tragic, or be foolish. But let the guilt go. And try and lick your own balls. # The pressure The pressure # # Whoa-oa-oa, the pressure pressure of the world # [Men Chatting] I don't know. I'm just kind of frustrated. Everyone was just concerned with all this other stuff. I just wanted it to be fabulous, and it's not about that. It's too hard to be fabulous in New York. - It's true. - That's not what I'm talking about. In New York, there are so many people and so many outfits! It's like a parade at Roxy. Oh, God! I can't handle it! Wait, look. Julio, do your coke face. Come on. Okay, this is what I look like when I'm fucked up on coke. - Like tonight? - Wait. Let him do it again. Let's go. I have to work tomorrow. Today. [Julio] Does anyone know what Miss Honey does? - Passes out fliers on 42nd Street. - [Men Laughing] - What a loser job! - Shut up, Herbie. My name is not Herbie. It's Toby. - Why do you keep calling me Herbie, Tommie? - I can't help it. You look like Herbie. Doesn't he look like Herbie with that blond poof in front? You know, the elf in Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, the one that wants to be a dentist? - You know what I'm talkin' about, Toby. - I don't know, Tommie. Remember? Herbie goes, [Squeaky Voice] "I want to be a dentist." And the old elf goes, [Deep Voice] "Well, isn't that something? - Herbie wants to be a dentist." - Will you shut up, Tommie? - He does. - I don't want to hear any more about this Herbie. I need to get the fuck out of here for a while. Yes, folks, half-price seats still available for today... for the world's most popular musical, Les Miserables. I've got front row seats. Who needs tickets to Phantom? - I've got tickets to Miss Saigon. - They call this Broadway for one reason. That's because it is a broad way... to hell! Half price at the theater box office with this flier. Don't stand in line. Half price at the theater box office with this flier. Half price at the theater. Don't stand in line. Hey, half price. Laughed myself silly. Half price at the theater with this flier. Don't stand in line. Half price at the theater box office. Hey, half price at the theater. Half price at the theater with this flier. Don't stand in line. Half price at the theater box office with... Excuse me? Excuse me. Pick that up and throw it in the trash if you don't want it. The street is not a fucking garbage pail. Half price at the theater box office with this flier. No? Hello? Pick the goddamn piece of paper up. Can you hear me? - Pick it up. - No. No? No? Y-You think it's okay to just throw your trash on the street? You know something? It's tourists like you that make this city so dirty. [Heavy Panting] Now, attention. Attention.! Attention.! I want everyone to know that this lady is a scumbag. C'mere! C'mere. I want everyone to look at this lady. I want everyone to get a good look at her. Get a good look. Everyone! Look at this lady, 'cause she's a scumbag. Everyone.! She likes to throw her trash on the street. Everyone, look at this lady, okay? Look at her. [Panting] ##["Find A Way"] # You know, my love we gotta find a way # # We'll find a brighter day We'll find a better way # [Man] Tommie.! Tommie.! Tommie! # We'll find a brighter day We'll find a better way # Hi. Guess where I'm going. Provincetown. And I'm going right now. Provincetown? Isn't that someplace where all those homosexuals go? It had better be. My, God! I've got to get out of this place. I'm so sick of it. - This hole! - Yeah, this city is a big toilet. Especially now that it's hot, everything smells like urine. My, God, I'm so sick of looking at all these straight people. - You don't know. - I'm sick of looking at all these ugly people. - Oh, there are so many cute boys there! - How are you getting there? I was supposed to go with Peter and Sal in their jeep tomorrow. - The twins? - Mm-hmm. - I didn't know you knew them. - I slept with both of them. - Separately. - Uh-huh. You know Sal cannot drive. And Peter is just a stagey, overdramatic queen. An actress. Please! "I have a career!" Not! The last time I saw her... she was runnin' down Avenue "C" having a hissy fit. So, I'm takin' the Bonanza bus. I don't care if it does cost me money. I really don't. I've gotta go. In fact, I gotta go right now. So, I'll see you later? See you at the end of summer? Send you a postcard? - Okay. Bye. - Bye. [Eddie's Voice] i'm so tired of this place. I've got to get out ofhere. This hole.! Guess where i'm going. Provincetown. Send you a postcard. There are so many cute boys there. - I was supposed to go with Peter and Sal in theirjeep tomorrow. - [Phone Dialing] [Tommie's Voice On Phone] Peter... uh, Sal. I heard you guys are driving up to Provincetown tomorrow. No, I don't know anyone up there. But, well, Peter and Sal are driving up tomorrow. - [Toilet Flushes] - Uh-huh. I'm just gonna have them drop me off in the middle of town. Right. Right. I know it's scary, but... I have like $50. I have credit cards. No, a couple aren't maxed out. No, I know it's crazy, but... No, don't tell him. - [Phone Rings] - Listen, Dad, what is there to know about? Well, you're not going. Because I want to. First of all, I am not wasting my life. I'm just postponing things in order to live a little. Well, it's not your decision. All right. All right. Okay, I will. What? Who's there? I'm going to Provincetown for the summer. I'm riding up with Peter and Sal. I feel like Andy Warhol planning a party. I can't believe you're just gonna go and spend the whole summer. - That's great. What are you gonna do? - I don't know yet. - Are you scared? - A little bit. ##["Free Your Mind"] #Free your mind you're wasting your time # #Did you ever wonder who made it the first line # #Free your mind you're wasting your time # #Did you ever wander away from inside ## Bye. [Sighs] Oh, just a little sideliner for your info. This is near where the Pilgrims landed, in case you didn't know. That's the town hall over there, and the library's right here. And there are about a hundred guest houses. It's, uh, sorta like Our Town, right? Hi. Well... I have to find some cheap guest house. The last thing I want right now is for someone to come up to me and say... "Are you all right? Are you lost?" Or to have some cop tell me to move it along... unless he was a cute cop. Anyway, all these guest houses have letter codes at the end of them. "A" is for air conditioning. "B" is for private baths. "C" is for cleaning lady. What's the letter for cheap? "G" is for gay-owned, and "L" is for lesbian-owned. Oh, my God! What does that mean? I'm not looking to have sex with the innkeeper. What if this means they're sex dens? No, there's too many "L's" and "G's." They can't be sex dens. Maybe I need a sex den. No, I'm gonna go for "G"... 'cause I'll never meet anyone in a straight house. "G." Let's see here. "Captain Largo's. Spaciously designed, exquisite rooms." Sounds expensive. "G." "John Francis House. Old Sea House." Sounds dirty. "G." "Glen's House. We've always depended upon the kindness of strangers and strange kinds." Sex den! I knew it! There are sex dens. "G." "Land's End." Hmm. "Clean. Inexpensive." We like that. This sounds really good. This is me. I'm gonna go for it. Suddenly I feel like the town is the size of a shoe box... and everyone knows everyone and is lookin' at me. - Okay, here you are. You're all set. - Thanks. - I'm sorry. Did you want to see the room first? - No, I'm sure it's okay. I'm Dan, by the way, and this is Bob. - Hi. - Hi. [Tommie's Voice] i thought i'd toss and turn all night, but i didn't. I mean, i have no money, nojob, i don't know anyone really. But i think i slept better than i did in the womb. [Laughs] And i don't even know what i'm gonna do with the day. It's totally terrifying, but i'm free. And in some ways, that's too exciting to be terrifying. But still, i have to move, figure things out fast... and i have to do whatever it is i need to do, and i don't even know what that is. But it has to happen before i max out my credit card. [Sighs] What's comforting is that the town looks so much like a perfect Hollywood set, the kind of place where everything always works out okay, even love. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Did you sleep well? - Yes, thanks. - You gonna hit some sights today? - No, actually, um... - I want to spend the summer, so... - Ah, so you need to find an apartment. And a job. Are apartments expensive? Not only are the apartments expensive, like $5,000 or $6,000 for the season... but you gotta have two-thirds just to move in. Unless you're lookin' for a houseboy job, but they're all gone. In fact, all of the summer jobs are gone. They go right before Memorial Day. Well, except for the house down the street. Glen's House. [Tommie's Voice] There was something so familiar about Glen's House. But i couldn't quite put my finger on it. [Knocking] Hello. And what can I do for you? [Tommie] in fact, i never even heard of the expression, "houseboy"before... - except for in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? - In what? The movie, Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Oh, right, the porn films. Very big in the porn films. So let's talk about the rules. You'll find I'm very easygoing, and I really only have one rule... but it's very important. I don't know what they've said to you at the other houses... or what their position is. Everyone has a different position. - I haven't been to any of the other houses yet. - Right. Well, this is it: I don't want my houseboy sleeping with any of the guests. - I see. That happens, huh? - Oh, yeah. - You'd be surprised what goes on around here. - I didn't know. - No one's mentioned this before? - Not yet. Uh-huh. Well, it happens. - Does it? - Oh, yeah. It's expected in many places. I don't know how you feel about that. - Well, I would never. - It happens a lot. - Of course, if it was discreet... - Right. Very discreet. Right. And you found one of the guests hot, and he found you hot... I don't think I'd have a problem. Right. But you don't want me to have sex with the guests. Hmm. I think I should also mention that I encourage my guests... to relax around here in the nude if they want. I want 'em to have a good time. And your job as houseboy is to entertain them... and make sure they have a good time. And that's good for you too... because houseboys get tips, and that can only increase your tips. But you don't want me to have sex with the guests. No. Absolutely not. But like I said... if you find each other hot... Even if you don't find him hot but he finds you hot... and you set up some sort of discreet arrangement... I don't think I'd have a problem with that. - But I don't want you... - To have sex with the guests. Exactly. This is the point in the film where I'm supposed to start rubbing my crotch. And then he starts rubbing his crotch. And then there's this horrible close-up on my eyes, like this. And then his eyes. - And then he offers me a back rub or something. - Would you like a back rub? - This is what he's thinking, right? - It happens a lot! Not! [Yelling] [Tommie] I was gonna get an apartment. - [Woman] Where? - I don't know. I can't really afford one, but... You're gonna become a houseboy. Forget everything else. Houseboy! - Okay, that's it. I'm gonna be a houseboy. - Good. Now, here are some leads. But the best thing to do is just knock on every door in town. - What should I do? Should I bring my resumes? - Are those your resumes? - Yeah. - Let me have them. Give them to me. You don't need these in this town. Now, come here. Come here. Come here! Come here! You don't apply for houseboy's positions, Tommie. - You audition for them. - Thanks. Now, hit those leads I gave you. ##["Free Your Mind"] #So free your mind # # Your freedom will follow # [Chuckling] # Whoo, Linda, Linda, Linda Linda, Linda, Linda # #Linda, Linda, Linda # #Ah, do-dah, do-dah do-dah, do-dah # #Linda, Linda, Linda Linda, Linda, Linda # #Sha-na-na-na-na # #i saw you walkin'down the street feelin'sad, lookin'beat # #Nothin'to call your own # # Take another look around ain't no use in feelin'down # # Try openin'up your heart # #Sha-na-na-na-na Sha-na-na-na-na # # Come on, baby, you can rise # #Sha-na-na-na-na Sha-na-na-na-na # You might wanna try the A&P. #Free your mind # - Okay. - #Let your love light shine # #Free your mind # #Let it shine, shine # #Baby, free your mind and let your love light # #Let it shine # #Linda, Linda, Linda Linda, Linda, Linda # #Ah, do-dah, do-dah do-dah, do-dah # #Linda, Linda, Linda Linda, Linda, Linda # #Shine-ine-ine # #Life is what you make it, honey # # You don't even need no money to have a funky good time # #Sugar, look inside yourself You are you, nobody else # #A shinin'superstar # #Sha-na-na-na-na Sha-na-na-na-na # # Come on, baby, we can rise # #Sha-na-na-na-na Sha-na-na-na-na ## They keep playing that over and over.

I found some old, ugly guys. Stayed with them for a week. But, hey, I'm here, and I got a houseboy job. - Simon, you're repulsive. - [Laughing] Fuck it.

I have to go to the job office right now. I know. I hate lookin' for a job. Hey! - Maybe we'll go together. We'll give each other moral support. - Okay. I had two jobs, but I got fired from them both on the same day. - Really? - Ah, it's this town. You'll see. People here go through jobs like condoms. It can be really uptight and fucked up. And it's that time of year when they can replace you in a minute... 'cause everybody's out job huntin'. - Aren't you worried about finding another job, though? - Uh-uh. - What kind of job are you lookin' for? - Houseboy. That's a great way to start. Listen, be careful, though. There's some scary houses in town, some evil owners. Look. Be careful of the homes that are owned by recovering alcoholics. There's lots of them. Those are the evil ones. All these bitter queens that are left over from the '70s, they go to A.A. Every week. Scary! Believe me, scary. - [Woman] What are my tips? Be sexy. - Be sexy. That's right. - Be smart. - Be smart.

This South American guy. And he's beautiful. And he might leave too, and I feel sorry for him... because he was a houseboy and they kicked him out. - I wish I could help him. - Where did you meet this guy? - At the job service. - That's about all that job service is good for. Well, that's great. I'm meeting a guy in half an hour to do a hit of ecstasy. - You wanna come? - Nah. - What are you gonna do, go job hunt? - Ah, screw that. I can't think about a job now.

This guy I stay with, uh, Burt, there's a room for rent upstairs. Burt says 'cause the guy move 'cause he don't pay the rent. It's one room, and the bathroom you share. No kitchen. But it's okay. It's very, very cheap. We move in together and split the rent. - Yeah, you want to? - Sure. - It's okay, it's all set. We move in together. - [Laughs] - I have to see it first. - Oh, sure, yeah. Of course. We'll go see it tomorrow, yeah, 'cause you have to know. I like you a lot. I like you so much. You wanna go somewhere? Okay. Let's go. [Sighs] Where can we go?

I've spoken to him for a minute practically... and he wants us to live together for the summer, sharing a room. - Isn't that weird? - Those foreigners are all like that. - You have to be careful. - You're a foreigner. True. All of a sudden he decided he couldn't kiss me 'cause of dental work. - It was weird. - So, are you gonna move in with him? I'll look at the place with him. We're supposed to go tomorrow afternoon. Be careful. Besides, you're here to meet lots of boys this summer, aren't you? You don't want to be tied down in this town.

My name's Tommie, and I'm looking for a houseboy job. Hi, I'm Jeffrey. Come on in. We have a great house. It's clean, very elegant. I have some magnificent pieces of crystal. They take that extra amount of cleaning, but the guests love it. I should mention right off that I don't drink. I'm a recovering alcoholic. Let's go to the basement, and i'll show you what would be your room. - The basement. - We really are a team here. Now, it's right down this way. [Engines Whirring, Water Dripping] It's not so bad, is it? Oh, no. It's kind of nice. I've seen worse than this, actually. Much worse. - Well, I think it's very nice. - It's great. I've just finished this book about destitute... abused, impoverished Jamaican women. True stories. Suddenly their lot doesn't seem so bad. I mean, at least they get a small salary for this kind of work, right? I do go see the place with Tom later... but it's twice as expensive as he thought. It's impossible. I've been to over 50 guest houses... and this and Glen's have been my only offer. I mean, it's either here or being strapped to a bench and paddled all summer. I can't impose on Mishi and Sally any longer. It's not right. So, l... I take it. - I'll take it. - Great. The Standard House? Tommie, no! I told you not to take a job there. That's one of the worst. Hey, who do I have to blow to get a cup of coffee around here? Don't you remember me telling you all the houses to stay away from? That was one of them. Alcoholic! Evil! Evil! Evil! You wait 'til he wants to have a drink and he can't find one. Oh! [Laughs] He seems nice, right? - Yes, he seems nice. - Hmm. "Seems nice." You just wait. The cheap crystal will be flying. Guy, I come from a long line of alcoholics... - and none of them are out-and-out evil. - So do i. But we're Irish. We're good-time alcoholics. We're like lucky charms, green beer, corned beef and cabbage alcoholics. He's like, "I'm gonna have a shot of tequila, beat your wife... shove my dick in your yoo-hoo" kind of alcoholic. I mean, there's a difference. - Goin'out tonight? - Every night. ##[Hard Rock] - Do you have a cigarette, baby? - Here. - [Water Splashing] - Ooh. So cute. So many cute. Unbelievable! - How rude! - What? - Baby, will you buy me a beer? - Here. - Geez, I don't know about him, Tommie. - I know. Just a few minutes ago he told me he didn't have any money... so if it was okay, I would pay for us to get an apartment... - and he'd pay me back when he got a job. - I don't know. - Square states. - What? God! I was trying to figure out what the big drawback was about Provincetown... - and now I've finally put my finger on it. - What? There are so many square states here. The guys come from all over. - Oh, my God. - Come here to the dance floor. I'll show you. Square state. Has what you may call a lesbian haircut, but no, i call it pure suburban guy fashion. Short on the sides and wisps in the back. Square state. Shops at Chess King. Brush cut forward, thinks he's cool 'cause he's in a lesbian bar. Square state. Doesn't know how to dress. Gots an i.D. Bracelet. Did you know that fags could have such a lack of taste? Square state! Square states. I call 'em square states. Square states are guys who so obviously look like they're from some state... that nobody could identify on a map. It's landlocked, and shaped like a square. [Tommie With Jamaican Accent] Do you want to dance and be happy? I have to get up and go in the kitchen, and get the continental breakfast. After the breakfast finish, me have to tidy up the house. Clean the toilet. Clean, clean, clean. Toilet, toilet, toilet. And make up the bed. All day, me wash and clean and do-dee-da-dee. And all I get is the basement room and some Cheese Whiz. [Sighs] And so... in the morning after the long and rainy night... when I put my feet down... and go "splash," I say, "Fuck this! I'm gettin' the hell outta here!" Aah! [Chuckling] I'm glad you quit. - Oh, look. - What? - That guy, he is so gorgeous. - Oh, him. - You don't think he's gorgeous? - No, he's not my type. He's the first guy I saw when I got here. I hate that perfect type. Huge ego, totally uninteresting. - Complete asshole. - Oh, I'd still fuck him. I don't find this guy attractive. He needs a mirror to have sex. Shh. He's comin' over here. - Hey. Aren't you from New York? - Hi. - Yeah. - Thought so. - I'm from there, or I was from there. I'm Ben. - I'm Tommie. - This is... - Hey, you girls! Hey, baby. [Coughs] - Do you have a cigarette, baby? - Sure. Ooh, hello. Ooh, so cute. Mmm, i like this. So nice. Unbelievable. - How are you? - I'm good. Listen, baby, let's go. Portuguese bakery. I'm hungry. - Portuguese bakery? - Well, I'll see you guys. Bye. Portuguese bakery. They have big cheeseburger. Ah, so good. It's the biggest cheeseburger. I eat six of them. - No! - Ah, c'mon. It's nothin'. I eat six cheeseburgers like that! Oh, but listen. I have to tell you something. I meet a drag queen. She found out about this guy. He works at the, uh... what do you call it? - Auschwitz? - The Friendly King. He got a room to rent so cheap. $300. He only wants one guy in it, so you could take it and... maybe i sleep over for a little while. What's this guy's name? - Charles Manson? - No. - No? - Uh, Ru. Yeah, Ru. - At the King Friendly. So you should go see him. - Okay, listen. Why don't I go see this guy Ru? Then I'll go to the store and get stuff to make cheeseburgers. - Then I'll meet you in Sally's in say an hour? - Okay, we do that. You go see this guy Ru, and then we make a cheeseburger. Oh, but I have to tell you one thing. - He's straight. - Yeah? Straight? - Yeah. Fuckin' straight guy. - Hmm. Okay. Hey, King Friendly, who's gonna pick up the tab? [Coughing] First of all... I smoke pot. And I don't know how you feel about that... but if you have any problems with that, I mean, let me just tell you right now... that is how it is. And I smoke a lot, and I smoke right here... in this room. - I don't care. - Okay. Good. Um, I'm not very clean. I'm not, you know, heavy into cleaning. [Laughing] It's not what I do. There is no phone in the apartment. Um... the room back there would be yours completely. Totally private. Now, I'm gonna be quite honest with you. Sometimes I walk around the apartment naked. Like you might see me, I don't know, in a dress and high heels sometime. The room is great. I mean, I'll take it. Good. We now have a bed to fuck in. But right now, I fuck you on the kitchen table... while we wait for a cheeseburger. - Yeah, you want to? - Yeah. - [Moaning] Ooh. - So good. Everything was so good. A week passes, and I get a job prepping food in a restaurant. Steak knife. Could you hand her a steak knife? They're right there on the line. What was that? They were right in front of her. Why didn't she get it herself? That's just the way we do things here. - Steak knife. - [Sighs] So I got a job and a place... and he's been fucking me for a week now. Then Mishi tells me he still doesn't even know my name. He said, "who's Tommie?" When I asked him where you were. I said, "What's the name of the guy you've been sleeping with?" And he drew a blank. How can that be? We both have the same name. I don't know, but you'd better straighten him out. So I asked him about it at a house party, and this is what he tells me. So, I heard you didn't know my name. I know your name. It's Tommie. That's not what I heard. It's Tommie. C'mon, I gotta tell you something. When I was in the army... we do a... What do you call it when you jump out of a plane? - Parachuting? - Right, parachuting. And I land bad in the tree, and I hit my head. And they put me in the hospital for six months. And now I have trouble to remember certain things like names. Sorry. Time has passed, and he still won't kiss full. - No. - Why? - I told you. - It's been a while now, Tom. The last time you brushed your teeth was probably like 15 hours ago. - There's no blood. - Still, it's no good. You just don't like to kiss, do you? No. You're afraid you're gonna get Al DS, aren't you? That's so stupid. You're not gonna get Al DS that way. Ask anyone. Ask a doctor. I know. I was a nurse in Key West. Then you should know better than anyone if you were a nurse. - They don't know! - Oh, my God! This is so stupid. You're just as likely to get hit by a car. That doesn't mean you don't leave the house. [Sighs] Hey, Moochy, I go to your place just now, and there's no one there... and the door is unlocked, so I go in and make myself a cheeseburger, okay? - You made yourself a cheeseburger? - Yeah. It was good. Sure, Tom, just go in and make yourself a cheeseburger anytime. He doesn't want to kiss 'cause he's scared of Al DS. Get rid of him... immediatement. There are some things you just don't tolerate, and that's one of them. - I think he's afraid to be intimate. - [Tom Groans] - Sometimes he fucks without passion. It's business. - Get rid of him. I need intimacy, even if it's only a one-night thing. Definitely. I think the army fucked him up. He's sweet, and he's an asshole. He's got the finest body, though. Maybe I can convince him that it's okay to kiss. Take him to the clinic. If that's what you wanna do; but remember, it's the summer. You're here to have fun. You don't need a boyfriend. - That's not what this place is for. - Everyone keeps telling me this. Where did I find him? "I'm from that place that's untouched by western civilization," he says. All right. I.e., Third World. - He told me he was from Brazil. - I think he's from the islands. - Long Island, that is. - Either way, he looks like a reject from Menudo. - His delegation is the one... - No, I'm sure he said he's from Guatemala. You know, Chris thinks you're cute. - I could set you up with him if you like. - Who's Chris? Our gar?on. Yeah, he is cute. - Hi, guys. - Hi, Ed. - Hi, Ed. Who's the waiter? He's cute. He hasn't got a clue. He just has the finest body. He does judo. Judo! And now he's pursuing me. - Tommie! Tommie! - # Tom's hardly perfect # Tommie! What's the matter? You don't like me anymore? I don't know. Do you have a cigarette, baby? C'mon, sit down and have a cigarette. #Lie down with dogs and you get up with fleas # ##[Song Continues] One minute he's this weird South American maniac. I kill them! - Anyone who crosses with me. - #He's a proud liar # Even the police in Brazil. When I was in the army and we were in Brazil, they know! On the street one day, 'cause I fight this guy. And they see if they fuck with me, I kill them! And the next minute, he's singing me this tragic Latino love song. ## [Singing In Spanish] ## [Continues Singing] See? No bad singer. No. It's beautiful. - # Tommie, you dreamer # - Okay. - I go home to bed now. - Okay. - # Tomorrow's the new day just wait and you'll see # - Tommie? #Just wait and you'll see Just wait and you'll see # I like you. [Singer] Tommie, just wait and you'll see. [Moaning] I'm spending a lot of time with him. The summer is moving along. He still hasn't got a job or a place. Then one night we're hanging out with Sally. 'Cause, I mean, I've got two jobs now. It took me a while to find them, and they're both lame... but I'm just surprised you haven't found anything yet. Ah, so many assholes. Is crazy. Crazy town. Crazy people. Oh, so fun tonight dancing. And you got your own room now. - Hey, Tom! - Hey, baby. - Hey, you goin' my way? - Yeah, get in. [Tom] Hey, wait.! - Can I come home with you? - Can you come home with me? - Are you mad at me? What's wrong? - Oh, my God. - What? - Nothing. What, 'cause I leave? - I don't want a husband. - Please. I'm sorry. I just got a ride. You didn't even say good-bye. It's 'cause you're mad, aren't you? You wanted me to say good-bye to you? Forget it. Geez. - So, can I come home with you? - Yeah, fine. - Where did you go? - This guy just gave me a ride home to Burt's where I stay. - He was goin' my way. - You couldn't wait and walk? It's not that far. It only takes five minutes. Why did you come back? 'Cause these fuckin' assholes I stay with forget to leave the key under the mat. I got locked out. It's crazy. I go home, there's no one there. I can't get in and go to sleep. - So you came back to find me. - Yeah. Wait a minute. You went home, the door was locked, and that's why you came back to find me? - Right. - You leave. You don't even say good-bye, then you come back... and ask me if you can come home with me 'cause you can't get into Burt's? The only reason you're sorry and wanna go home with me is 'cause you have nowhere to sleep. That's so fucking lame! That's just using people. So you don't want me to come home with you? I don't care. I don't care what you do. [Sighing] You don't wanna go back into town? I don't care. Do whatever you wanna do. Hey, look! A gold necklace! Ah, I'm so lucky. Look at this. It's gold. Wow! - [Moaning] - Ow! Ow! So that's it. It's over. I came here to enjoy myself. I came here... Ahh! Ahh! So, did you hear about your boy? He's not my boy anymore. Well... he found a gold necklace... and he sold it to a jeweler for 250 bucks. Oh, great. That really makes my day. Think if I see him again he'll buy me a beer? Not. He's an asshole. I'm over him. I came here to enjoy myself. I came here to... [Moaning] - Over him! Hit it! - Over him! Hit it! Ahh. I'm ready to start the summer over again correctly... before it's too late. - Hi. - Hi. - What's your name? You always wait on us. - Chris. - I'm Tommie. - Hi. #I looked in your eyes they gave me a thrill # #Rush went my heartbeat the summer stood still # # We came together the moment we met # #it was a sweet day i'll never forget ## - Tommie! - Eddie! I heard you slept with that guy Chris last night. How was it? It was good. Geez, this town is small. - So, you gonna see him again? - Maybe. I don't know. - You don't know? - He's kind of boring to me. Besides, so many men. - Hey, Ben.! - [Eddie] Oh, my God.! - You know that guy? - What is it with everyone and that guy? He's not that great. C'mon, let's go get drunk. [Drunken Chatter] Jesus Christ! Everybody's always so fucked up. Hello! Come here, little boy. Yeah, come here, little boy. I've got something for you, you stupid shit! Oh, damn! [Together] Wanted him, needed him, had him. Over him. Or something like that. Over him. What's next? What? What'd you say? Nodded him? It's wanted him, needed him, had him. - Over him. Over him. - All right, all right. [Laughing] All right, let's do it again. [Together] Wanted him, needed him, had him. - Over him! - Damn! - What's next? I got it, got it! - Go ahead. - Horny! Need him again. - [Laughing] Next! But you try. [Laughing] You need that more than I do. - Yech. - Guys, listen. Let's go find some cheap sex. Why do we have to go find it? You're right here. [Laughing] [Laughing Continues] Oh! Ow! Oh, my head is killing me. I have a sore throat. God, I woke up this morning with the worst sore throat. I wonder why. Man, this cat's a drag. What's that supposed to mean? I saw those three musketeers doing a sword fight in your mouth last night. Yeah? Well, you go lower, deeper, and stay down longer... and come up dirtier than any man I've ever met. When you lie down with dogs you get up with fleas. Go buy yourself a Hartz Two-In-One. You'd be dead if he did. - Oh, God! I have no money. - That's what you get for sittin'on your brains all day. Why don't you go scam a meal from some other suckers, you cheap mug? You're one to talk. You're the biggest chiseler since Michelangelo. I got to sit here with a bunch of fags beatin' their brains out with powder puffs. Listen, honey, you got a lot to learn. I hope you never learn it. Which arm do you take it up in? I thought you just got another job? Why don't you break out in hives and scratch yourself to death? They fired me. [Laughing] They fired you? I guess i'm fired. I went to that party the other night... and it didn't end 'til noon and I was supposed to be at work at 10:00. - So i guess i'm fired. - [Together] What party? The party that l... Oh, my God! I didn't tell you about that party the other night! It was amazing. It was at Troy's and Jeff's house. - You guys know those guys, right? - [Together] No! Yes, you do.! Troy is gorgeous. Got the best body. He's a go-go dancer at the Crown. And Jeff's his boyfriend. He's the biggest ecstasy dealer in "P-town," for God's sakes. Do you remember him now, George? It was amazing. It was one of the best parties I have ever been to. God, there were so many boys I'd never seen before. And all these drugs. They hired a D.J. - They flew him in from New York City. - No way! They have this big house. It's up in the woods somewhere, i don't know. Oh-ho-ho. You know what? This year it is like the '90s are finally kickin' in. Everybody's doin'drugs. People are havin'sex again. It's like everybody's over the '80s. You know, really ready to party now. [Chanting] Take it off! Take it off! Take it off! Take it off! Steak knife! [Moaning] [Shouting] Put it back on! Put it back on! - Straight guys have no clue. - It's true. [Moaning] My God! I've only had six jobs, Tommie. Guy's been through nine. Nine. Steak knife! [Moaning] What? What? No, that's not what I'm worried about. I know people are going to say that everyone in the picture is self-indulgent. I don't care. Yes. Yes. In fact, I'm sure most gay people are boring, but this isn't Longtime Companion. I mean, let the gay rights groups fight for the right for gay people to be seen as boring. I mean, my job as filmmaker is not to be boring, right? What? No. Not... Disgusting is not the answer. Disgusting is not the answer. I don't know. Why do you ask me this? No, l... I'm just not into shock value. I mean... Well, my idea of disgusting would be to have the character get drunk. Really drunk... with like real alcohol. Yeah. And have it serve as like a metaphor for inner disgust. [Gasping] Well, it could be funny. I do have horror. No, horror is different. Hi. You look at some people and you say, "No matter how drunk I am, I would never, ever!" [Tommie's Voice] He reminded me of Eric Roberts in Star 80. Eric Roberts plays this greasy, low-life pimp... who murders, in real life, Playboy centerfold Dorothy Stratton. It was him. We've all slept with one. [Whispering] The one benefit: He's a houseboy. And I need new sheets and towels. I wanted to sleep with a houseboy all summer so I could get new sheets and towels. [Tommie] When i got home, i went to bed. And then i woke up really, really sick. There's no phone. Ahh. No phone. You okay? Hey, Herbert! Herbert, come here. There's something wrong with this guy. Sunstroke or something. Leave him alone, Margaret. Don't touch him. He's one of them homosexual fag birds. Don't touch him! - It's him! - What? - The guy in the picture. - [Tommie] Leave me alone. Is it? Holy shit! Listen, we saw that disgustin' thing of yours. - Yep, we did. Two times. - Uh-huh. - Once in the theater, and once at our religious club. - Uh-huh. Sodomy! Sodomy! Sodomy! You're hell bound.! [Tommie] Who are you? We're normal people... from Oklahoma. Yeah? Where's that, exactly? Don't you get funny with me. We're breeders. We perpetuate the race. [Tommie's Voice] I somehow knew that i had worn myself out and gotten the flu. But the panic and the need for security is, i, i think, inevitable. No matter how safe i've been, i can't forget the fact that the odds are against me. Suddenly i'm Ratso Rizzo. I'm scared. I had to find Guy, who out of anybody... could get me to Wellfleet. Tommie! Oh, my God, Tommie. You missed another amazing party last night. - Guy, can you take me to Wellfleet, to the clinic? - To Wellfleet? - Or one of your roommates? They both have cars, right? - They're not here right now. I'm really sick, Guy. I need to see a doctor and the clinic here is closed. Oh. Well, there's nothing I can do. Their cars don't work that well, and I just can't take one, anyway. [Laughing] i mean, they're not here. I don't know what to tell you. Please, Guy. Just call someone with a car. I can't think of anybody who has a car. I'm hungry. I'm starving. Why don't you come and have breakfast with me... and then maybe you'll feel better? Please, Guy. Now calm down. Let's have breakfast together and then I'll take you to the pharmacist. Maybe the pharmacist can give you something until you feel better. Agh! Mmm. Mmm-hmm-hmm. He's so cute, this guy I slept with last night. He's rich too. Got a big house up on the west side. We're gonna have to go there for cocktails sometime, darling. What is your problem? - I haven't said anything at all. - Exactly. So you don't feel well. You don't have to be so dramatic about it. I can't be dealing with somebody who has AiDS or some shit. I came here to have a good time. The swelling in my throat has gone down actually. Yesterday I could barely even talk. - Are you sexually active? - Yes. - Men? Women? - Men. Have you recently had unprotected oral sex? Well, yes, but he didn't... there wasn't... Mm-hmm. Gonorrhea's going around these days, and hepatitis. I'll run these tests and you can call in on Monday for the results. Ahh. [Gagging] [Tommie's Voice] i'm walkin'home, feeling like total shit... and this square state that i don't even know... whispers to his friend on the street right behind me... so that i can hear that i'm a really vapid person. I didn't care about that, though. We're all dogs sometimes. Besides, i already knew now that i could never be a lifetime dog. So that didn't get to me. What got to me was this party. [Tommie's Voice] i meet this guy and we're talking. And all of a sudden he starts flippin'out. I'm drunk, slightly... but he's done "X"and "K" and is in a severe "K"hole. Just grab onto me. I'm right here. Something clicked inside of me. No longer down with dogs... - as much as i sometimes envied them. - Don't leave me. - Tonight i was defending him from them. - Oh, baby! - He likes it. - He doesn't like it. Don't touch him! - [Groans] - It's okay. It's just me. It's all right. It's me. So I take him home, put him to bed... and he sleeps for a little while, then he rouses. I had helped him for hours, and felt i connected with him... and myself. - Wanna play? - Really? - Yeah. - [Chuckling] Okay. I longed for something real. I mean, just looked forward to maybe just spending some time with him. - Yeah? - So, you know... I heard you fooled around with the old guy. Who's the new buzz? - Who's that guy? - Nobody. Ajerk. I'm not even thinking about how vapid he was... or how vapid I had become, or even about the fact... that it had been pointed out to me by a square state. I'm just aware of how difficult it is just to get together with someone. Maybe it was time to be alone. [Margaret] What are you sulking about? You got the test results, didn't you? No gonorrhea, no hepatitis. You had the flu! Whatever happened to that jogger... the one who waved at you when you first came into town? - Ah! He was sexy. - [Herbert] Margaret.! What is it with everyone and this jogger guy? - Hi. - Hi. - I haven't seen you in a while. - Been working a lot. - I haven't really gone out lately. - Yeah. I never go out. - You don't? - No. I don't like to drink, and, I don't know. I just don't like it. I like to get up early, go to the gym. Then go to the beach and go running. Just sort of relax, do nothing. - This trail's really great. - This your first time on it? - Yeah. - Follow me. I'll show you some stuff. Okay. ##["Give it Up"] #Everybody wants you # #Everybody wants your love # #i'djust like to make you mine all mine # #Nnn-nnn-nnn-nnn Nnn-nnn-nnn-now Baby, give it up # # Give it up, baby, give it up # I thought he'd be a real asshole if I talked to him... but he's not at all. And I thought he was like real generic looking... but I hadn't really looked at him. He is deeply beautiful. Not superficially beautiful... but like real fucking beautiful. I've never been so in love before in my entire life. He's the greatest person. So nice and so genuine... and not fucked up like everyone else in this town. And he's beautiful. #Nnn-nnn-nnn-now Baby, give it up # # Give it up, baby, give it up # #Nnn-nnn-nnn-nnn Nnn-nnn-nnn-now Baby, give it up # # Give it up, baby, give it up ## [Tommie's Voice] Suddenly i'm thinking about planning my tomorrows again. I was so Ben-happy, the next day i ran to the beach... and realized after our great day together, we had talked about spending time together... but totally forgot to make plans or exchange numbers. Now i want the fast pace of the summer to slow itself down. And i need to find him. - Hey, Tommie. - Tommie! - Hey, guys. You guys up for the weekend, huh? - Have you met my boyfriend... - Benjamin? - Yeah. - I think I've seen you around before. - [Sal] Here comes my Benjamin. - Have you met Tommie? - Yeah. Hi, Tommie. [Tommie's Voice] Sometimes there's nothing worse... than realizing you'vejust become someone's new... friend. Hey, Tommie. - You got a cigarette, baby? - [Sighs] Hey, Tommie. Tommie! Hey, fuck you, Tommie! Fuck you! - You're plastered. - He could've told me he had a boyfriend. - Besides, it was one of my friends. - You don't need a boyfriend. And don't be depressed. Just have fun. - Sally.! - Anthony, hi. Tommie, this is Anthony. Anthony, this is Tommie. - Hi. - Oh, there's Jimbo. Gotta go. # This is, this is, this is the essence # # Got you in a trance # # Got you in a trance # # This is, this is, this is the essence # # Got you in a trance # # Got you in a trance # - Would you stop gawking at me, Tommie? - # Got you in a trance # # Got you in a trance ## [Tommie's Voice] When i woke up in the morning, all hung over... i was a geek, rejected by someone i didn't even want... and afraid of showing my face to the world. I wanted only order and predictability in my life again. - Will you stop gawking at me, Tommie? - Eddie! Tommie! Lovin' life. Mean it. Haven't seen you. Bought you a get-well card. Funny! Gotta see it. - Eddie, I was sick almost a month ago. - I know. - Guy said you were the worst pain in the ass too. - That what he said? - Do you hate him, hate him? - I don't hate him. I just have no use for him. - Oh, I love him! - Do you? Yeah. And he loves me. I know it. He just can't seem to deal with it. - Nothing can touch him. Just can't deal. - Uh-huh. He's amazing though, Tommie. - He's taught me so much. - Right. How to fuck people over? I know what he is, Tommie. I know. You can't walk down the street with him during the day. He wants to hide 'cause he owes someone money or something. Oh, he's amazing, Tommie. Everyone around here is always suffering or something. Look at yourself. But Guy never lets these things get to him. If something bad happens, pretend it was nothing. That's what he does, that's what he says. Life is a game, Tommie. Life is unfair, Eddie. So if it's a game, it's a pretty lame game. - Exactement. - You're scarin' me. And you are a wuss... wimp and pussy combined. Look it. If I could look into the future and tell you that if you took something you wanted... say a stereo from Bloomingdale's... and you couldn't get caught, guaranteed, wouldn't you take it? So my happiness has to be at the expense of Bloomingdale's? All happiness is at the expense of someone. If you want to get real technical, our being in Provincetown... is at the expense of the native American Indian. Come on, the food we eat is at the expense of something now dead. And the only way to lick your own balls like a dog is to be a dog. Hey, swampie! Will you stop gawking at me? Will you stop gawking at me, Tommie? Will you stop gawking at me, Tommie? Will you stop gawking at me, Tommie? Thanks. - Pay him. - No, it's your turn now. - Pay him. - Oh, no. Uh-uh. It's him. On the dance floor. Right there. ##[Rock] - Will you stop gawking at me, Anthony? - Stop gawkin' at me, Anthony. [Together] Will you stop gawking at me, Anthony? [Tommie's Voice] i heard that night the guy had skipped town. The reason why? Depends on who you talk to. - Hey, Ben. - Hey, Tommie. - How you been? - Okay. Been lookin' for you. Been busy as usual. In fact, I have to go to work right now. So, when are you leaving? Hopefully this week. - Well, if I don't see you again... - Yeah. Are you coming back next summer? I doubt it. You? Probably. I always do. - Well, see ya. - Okay. Bye, Tommie. Bye. #If you leave at least in my lifetime # - #i've had one dream come true # - [Sighs] So, it's over. Summer is over. I get a ride back to the city with Peter who's up for Labor Day weekend. So, we have to pick up Benjamin. - Your boyfriend? - Yes! He's gonna move to New York with me. We're gonna live together. - You're so lucky. - I know. What are you gonna do? Are you gonna come back again next summer, do you think? No way. I mean, it's time for me to get serious with my life. I'm over this thing. I mean, I've done it. I'm over it. I'm over it! - Hey. [Honks Horn] - There he is. [Tommie's Voice] i think i've discovered everything in life... is important and trivial simultaneously. And the only morality is caring about other people or not. - It's not what you do but how you do it. - Hey, Peter... why didn't your brother come up for the weekend? He's with his boyfriend in Brooklyn. - I just saw Ben on the beach yesterday. - No, this is a new boyfriend. He and Ben, they broke up a long time ago. The last time we were here. So, are you gonna come back next summer, Tommie? [Tommie's Voice] i wanted to stop the car, but i'm too happy going forward. I know someone is out there for me. Maybe it's Ben, maybe not. I will find out, though. And so... I don't know what to tell you. I mean, I haven't figured it out yet. I did what I set out to do. I didn't sit home and think about it. I mean, I did it, and I guess that's what counts. I guess. You won't know unless you try, right? I'm comforted by the fact that the Buddha says: "He who thinks he knows, doesn't know." And he who sits at home, doesn't get out. Maybe I'll go back next summer. Maybe. Maybe! Perhaps for a long weekend. #Don't go # - #i'm beggin'you to stay please don't go # - He is out there. #Please don't go ## # You've got to reach and make the power your goal # #Feel it deep in your soul let the power take control # # You've got to reach reach for the sky # #it's the ultimate high you can make it if you try # # You've got to reach # # Oh, yeah, you've got to reach # # Oh, yeah, yeah # # One sunny day i woke and looked inside my head # #Pulled off the sheets andjumped right from my bed # # Got right up on my feet and looked around the room # # That's when it hit me the boom that shook the room # # Couldn't stop dreamin' thinkin'all last night # # These dreams i had were way out of sight # #Had all these questions but i didn't have a clue # #My spirit told me what to do # # You've got to reach and make the power your goal # #Feel it deep in your soul let the power take control # # You've got to reach reach for the sky # #it's the ultimate high you can make it if you try # # You've got to reach # #Reach Yeah, yeah, yeah # # Ooh, can't you feel the pulse deep inside and movin'all around # # The pressure is so hot it'll burn you to the ground # # You'll feel it touch your soul it'll make you move your feet # # The beat goes through you, babe you can't control the heat # #No more denyin' i've got to get it right # # Gotta open up my eyes and really see the light # #Don't tell me you don't feel it 'cause i know you feel it too # #Just let your heart be free and you'll know what to do # # You've got to reach and make the power your goal # #it's deep in your soul let the power take control # # You've got to reach reach for the sky # I was at that party by Gloria.

We go downstairs, and who is lying on the table? #Bitch, get out Bitch, get out Bitch, get out # #Bitch, get out Bitch, get out Bitch, get out # #Bitch, get out Bitch, get out Bitch, get out # Stark nude, but Gloria. And she's got peanut butter in her... and the dog's licking the peanut butter out of her... Well, happy birthday, Gloria! # Whoo # #Bitch, get out Bitch, get out Bitch, get out # #Bitch, get out Bitch, get out Bitch, get out # #Bitch, get out Bitch, get out Bitch gotta go ## - [Sighs] - [Man Laughing] What? Cut it.
