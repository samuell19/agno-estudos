Mom? Dad? Nick? Grace! Grace. Unlock the door. Sweetie, what's wrong? Jesus! What are you doing, Jake? I'm gonna break it down. Give me the bat, son. You're the worst player on the team. Give me that. Oh, it smells, like, so bad. Grace has been taken. She must be sleep-talking. You should not have inhabited this house. It belongs to Deominous. -Oh, come on. She's full of shit. I mean, really. A demon named Deominous? - Shut up, Jake. - Shut up, Jake. Yeah, shut up, Jake. Shut up, Jake. Shut up, Jake. Aah! Okay. Deominous, listen. My wife and I... This is Tammy. - Hi. - Deominous knows who you are. Right. Tammy and I, we spent a lot of money on this house. See, she's a decorator, and I'm a real estate agent, Ken Sellers... And I'll sell your house! Anyway, we wanted this house to be special for our kids. Yeah, right. And the problem is, we don't really want to move out because of you. So is there some way for Grace to hop on back into her own body and you can move into the guest room? - What? - Well, the basement. You can live in the basement. No! Alright, well, what do you want from us? Human sacrifice. Uh... What if we... we found you another sacrifice? A-A bigger one! No money down. - Ken! Could... Could we have Grace back then? And our house? - Grace? - Honey! Grace. What's going on? Mom and Dad made a deal with a demon for your soul back. Now we have to find someone else to sacrifice. And good luck with that. Who's desperate enough to move into a house with a demon? Hi. I'm Will. I'm here to help. Oh, well, Presto Paste is sorry to hear that you think the new recipe is too salty. But we now have more sodium bicarbonate than any major brand, increasing the overall whitening impact by half... a percent, which is actually a pretty big deal in the toothpaste community. Yes, the forums are going crazy. Hi. Hey, you look nice. Smell good. Hey, Amy, listen, I'm really sorry I wasn't there tonight. It's just, you know, I had the shift and people brush their teeth at night, and if they're like, "Hey, something tastes weird with my toothpaste. I need to talk to someone now!" you know, they have me. - What's in that? - It's cake batter. Oh, you're making a cake at 1:00 in the morning. Mmm. No, no, no. Cake pops. - Ohh! - Yeah. I wanted to surprise you, you know, celebrate your... Your big promotion. It was a promotion, right? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah. But you could've just come to the dinner with me. You didn't have to do all this. ...four decades. - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. I didn't realize you've been a Presto Paste customer for 40 years. No, I haven't stuck with anything for more than a few months. Five years. I mean, five years. Hey, where are you going? No, really, Amy, I am sorry. I just thought you had your coworkers and cool work friends and job and promotion, so I just... Okay. I get it. Well, that's for you. Will, you're making cake pops in the middle of the night and answering customer service calls. Well, I thought you... I thought you liked my job because we get free toothpaste. -The toothpaste is terrible. We don't even use it. Well, I'm, uh, I'm not gonna work there for forever. Yes, I am. Keep going. It's okay. And what do you want to do forever, then? Because you can't quit Presto Paste because you can't commit to doing anything else. That's not true. Oh, yeah, I am. I'm still here. No, no. You don't need to speak with a supervisor. O-kay. What happened to your woodworking business? Well, yeah, that was cool for a while until, you know, I saw online it's more economical to make and sell your own candles. You loved those candles. Yeah, remember? Seaside musk. Or no. Nah, I remember now. You did not like the candles. Yeah. Yes, I know. No, keep... go on, go on. Just wait a second. Wait. This is, um... The exercise tapes. I got those from the garage sale, remember? Even if I haven't exactly used them... yet. Uh, but the woodworking. I am almost halfway done with this dresser for you. And it's got character. But it'll get done. Will. I don't want you to give me an excuse. Or a hobby. Or a cake pop. Why didn't you come with me tonight? I need to know if this means as much to you as it does to me. I want a refund. Hello? Sorry, just let me finish. Yes, if you mail in your comment card Presto Paste would be... would be happy to... To refund you on that purchase. Uh-huh. Yes, and do fill out that survey after. Okay, thank you. Okay. Alright, bye-bye. No. Amy. Wait, hey.

Yeah, this might've been a little premature, actually, and I shouldn't have wasted... Wait. Whoa, there. You didn't even take a look. It's a heck of a deal. - Mm-hmm. What do you say, pal? You look like a smart and reliable human host. Don't you think so, Tammy? Oh, yes. Oh. No one's ever called me that before. Oh. Oh. Wow. My, uh, my girlfriend's apartment was like twice as much and didn't come with furniture, like this place. Well, I didn't have time to clear out most of the furniture that came with the estate, but, um... - Hm. - ...did you... Did you say girlfriend? Ex-girlfriend, I guess. - Oh. - Yeah. But I don't know. I mean, what do you guys think? Should... Should I see if we can work things out? I mean, love always wins, right? It sounds like you both need space. Take the time to learn who youare before you could be together. Ken's right. And, while you're here, are there any other relatives or friends who might look for you? - No. - Oh. But, you know, I should probably, um, check it all out, right, before I commit to anything. Amy always said I hate to commit. And maybe now is the time to change that, huh, buddy? - Go on. - Yeah. Have a look. Uh! So, what do you think? Interested? This used to be Grace's room. But it can be whatever you want. Guest room. Home office. Woodworking shop? Sure, if you want. Well, if this is your room, then, this must be yours, too. Oh, she... she found it here when we moved in, but she doesn't want it anymore. Oh, okay. I'll take it, then. Ah. Along with the house. Great. That's wonderful. Bye. Amy. "Hey, Will, what's your address?" She wants to come over. Right? "Hey, Will, what's youraddress?" Oh, that's definitely it. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

First off, they still have to change the recipe. - I'm sorry, but the-there's a lot of people that don't think the new recipe is actually too salty. - - Yeah, sure. - Okay, look, maybe if you just gave the new recipe a... A chance to figure itself out before... before you just end your relationship with it altogether, you wouldn't break its heart and you wouldn't suck its soul out and suffocate it and leave it just one hollow, empty... tube. Just transfer me. Yeah, I can transfer you to someone else. No, that's fine because the new recipe has, uh, better stuff to do tonight, anyways, so... - Really? - ...yeah, that works out. Hi. I'm Will, and I'm here to help. - Okay, he's not dead. - That's good. That's a positive thing for me to know. Hey, Patrick. I told you, I don't really want to talk to anyone right now, and this is my work phone and I know you know that. And, if you have a question about Presto Paste, I can't help you. Okay. You know that stuff sucks, right? It... It tastes like a... Like a friggin' butt. Well, I'm sorry to hear about your experience, sir. I-I-I personally don't really care for your tone. And the active ingredient is called sodium bicarbonate and I think it... It rocks, actually, so, good night. Hi, this is Will. Who is this? I just want to make sure that you haven't done anything stupid. You haven't tried to call Amy, have you? - No! - Okay. Or, well, once. - Oh! - Oh, I left her a voicemail, and I might've been crying. Will, you have to be prepared that you might not get her back. I-I know. I-I know that. I don't think you do. You know, she thinks I'm stalling... ...but it's kind of hard to figure out your whole life all of a sudden, you know? We're supposed to be a team. Well, are you? No. She, uh, dumped me. Stalling. Are you stalling? No... man. You do that weird voice when you're being deceptive. - No... I don't! There it is again. Agh! I don't have to listen to you! You're not my dad! Even though you're a boring lawyer guy, like my dad. - Okay. Your dad is a tax attorney and one of my personal heroes, so, thank you for the compliment, actually. - Wow. - I'm just worried about you. I don't think you're in a good headspace right now and you need a friend. Uh... my headset's gone. - Okay. -Yeah, that's good. You got to unplug sometimes. No, it... it was here, and now it's, like... It's completely gone. I... I gotta go. And I'm not stalling. I worked on the dresser today and exercised. And you can tell Amy that. I'm really trying here, Patrick. I am. So could you just tell her that, please? - Will... - Oh, my God. Fine. Don't. I don't care. Will... My sacrifice. Aah! Shh! Shh! He'll hear you. Hello? - He won't take him. - Yes, he will. Yes, he will. No, we'll do what he wants, but he doesn't want him. Soul's too weak. - Shh! - Do nothing. -He's coming. We'll do what he wants. But he doesn't want him. - He won't take him. - Yes, he will. Son of a... Oh. It's just a creaky house. New pipes are settling in, like the family said they would be. A rat moved my headset, and creepy stuff can't be creepy if it's not in the creepy basement. And the electricity is just faulty. It's creaky. It's fine. It's okay. I'm not scared. Okay. We got to, uh, try to get some sleep now. Okay? Ohh! Ohh! Oh, God. Ohh! Ohh! Hmm. Are you sure you weren't drunk when you did that? No, no. I would never bake a cake with the icing on it. It would melt. - Look, I... I know that you're trying to prove yourself or find yourself or something. I-I just don't think it's a good idea for you to be... Will, what are you doing?! God! Doesn't taste like one of my cakes, either. That could have poison in it! Or human blood or something. - You just don't like cake. - I like cake. It's just sugar rots your mouth, and I don't know why you'd want to do that to your body. I'm... I'm calling the cops. No, don't ca... It's fine. What are you gonna say? A yummy, scary cake just showed up in the kitchen? - Yeah. - What if it's... What if it's Amy saying she wants to get back together? You think that Amy broke into your house and wrote, "I will have your soul" on a cake? I think it's romantic. Oh, my God, Will. Come on! Well, thanks again for these, but you absolutely should not have called us. - But there's, um... - Yeah, the only unusual activity is the impressive amount of cakes you've made. But if you call us again and it's not a serious emergency, you will be fined. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. This is insane. Someone clearly broke in. Let's just... Let's call Amy, let her explain. - Amy didn't make the cake. Okay. But she's the only other person that knows I'm here besides you, you know? And I know Amy. Except she dumped you. Sorry, but... I just... No, don't you have a boring day job to get to? Really? Just... Just go. Loser. Not good enough. Patrick? Nice family? Amy? It's an old house. Old houses have drafts. Drafts that can move chairs. Yes, I've seen it in... in movies. Scary movies. You are worthless. Huh?! It's fine. It's fine. Let's get ready to start those stair climbs. Limber up. Come on. Don't hesitate. Get moving. Ready? And let's climb! Are you at the top yet? Great! Now turn around. Are you at the bottom yet? Now let's go back up. Are you at the top yet? Now turn around. Are you at the bottom? Now let's go back up. Are you at the top yet? Now turn around. Are you at the bottom? Great! Now go into the basement, Will! At the bottom? Great! Now turn around. Two more! You can do i... Come on. That's impossible. It's impossible. Deominous cannot possess Will's soul. He must leave and never return. Okay. What? Nope. Nope. Will? Hey! Hey. Were you about to break into my apartment? Uh, I... ...needed to tell you something, and you didn't answer, so I thought you were in trouble. What... What's the emergency? Um... You... You left your, uh, quarter with... with my stuff. Yeah, I just thought you might need it if, um, you need to do laundry or buy a soda or play... pinball. That's not an emergency. Mm. Totally. Uh... Will, this is Nick. - Hey. - Right. I'll be going then, and I'll, uh... I'll see you around. Unless I die. Or u-unless he dies. - Will? - Yeah. - Are you okay? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm good. I, uh... I'm good. I'm just gonna go home to my normal house and keep having the normal night I was having until you two decided to make a weird. Hey. Uh, so, yeah, I think I'm just gonna stay here for a while. Will is not welcome here! Apparently, I'm not welcome anywhere else, so we're gonna have to figure it out! Okay. I'm gonna go to my room now. Yep. Ohh! So you're just gonna stand there? I want my shirt back. You know, you're, uh... You're lucky to be a ghost. So then you can't fall in love and be dumped for Nick. Who's named Nick anyway? It's... It's weird, right? Ohh! Fine! It's not weird. He's probably really cool. Just leave me alone. I hate you. ...with over 172 properties sold this year. I'm Tim Sellers, and I will sell your... Sorry I wasn't who you needed. I know it's too late now for you to see that I'm better than I was. It wasn't your fault. You were just figuring things out. Maybe we can... try again? - Yeah. - Maybe we can... ...start over... No, no! It's too late. You have Nick now. - Oh, stupid Nick. -Forget Nick. What we had, it was real. We're connected. We're meant to end up together. We're... soul mates. No! -I don't deserve you, Amy. We both know it. I'm just a 27-year-old loser with a minimum-wage customer-service job, living in someone else's house with someone else's demons. - Hey. - Maybe you're right... Will. Maybe you have no purpose in life after all. - Shut up. - And now that I'm gone, too, how do you even live with yourself? Aah! Fine. You can watch TV. I don't care. Oh! Oh, God. You know what? I don't have to shower. Hey. You still in here, ghost boy? Huh? I'm not gonna hurt you. No surprises. Aha! Aah! What? What? I... I don't understand. You must leave. Will is not the sacrifice Deominous desires. Yeah? Well, why not? Hmm? Hey, why don't you ask this Deominous guy just what's so wrong with me? I'm right here. Here I am! Take my soul. I don't need it. Um, I'm not here 'cause I needed you or something. I just had to, uh, get out of the house for a while. Of course you did. You needed some human interaction. As opposed to the alternative? Yeah. What's, uh, the alternative? Let's just say that I am tired of certain demons sitting on their high horses, telling me I'm not good enough. Yeah, uh, we all need to listen to our inner demons sometimes, Will. That's our conscience telling us that we need to pay attention to our well-being. Hmm. Or when we need to start moving on. Hey. No. What is going on? - It's good for you. - Are you setting me up? - Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Hey! - Hi! - How's it going? - Good, good. - There you go. - Oh, thank you. Will, this is Aimee, from work. Hi. - Hi. - Amy is spelled with two E's. And an I. So it's totally different. Than the conventional spelling. Um, Patrick here has told me so many wonderful things about you. He said that... that you two have been friends since you were kids... - Mm. - ...which is pretty cute. - Yeah. Well, maybe. Just a couple of kids. Yeah. Ha. You know, craziest thing about Patrick is he got a cavity once. -It wasn't just a cavity. The dentist said that my tooth was so rotten that I could have died. Wow. Um... yeah. And it's also when you stopped eating sugar and cake. And it's also when you kind of stopped being fun. Can you just be normal for 5 seconds in front of Aimee, please? - Oh, I'm... I'm sorry that I'm not being normal like Patrick. Aimee... Am I pronouncing that right, by the way? - It's just Aimee. - Hmm. Well, there are... There are two E's. - There are. - Oh, God. You know what? I actually... I have a really big accounting meeting kind of early in the morning, so... That sounds interesting, doesn't it, Will? - Um... - Yeah, it's not actually that exciting. It's just we had a minor security breach, so... Oh. Will actually just had a pretty scary break-in. Why don't you tell her about that and, uh. how you were all alone in this big house, and it's... Haunted. It's super haunted. Come on, Will. Tell her the real story. That's the real... That's the real story. - Oh, shit. - It's super haunted. Ghosts... everywhere. I can't go anywhere. I have nowhere to go because Amy... Oh, sorry. That's my ex-girlfriend. And I bet you Patrick didn't want to bring her up because he thought I'd be weird about it, but I don't think I'm being weird, you know? Am I being weird? - No, no, no! It's... It's fine. - Yeah, I don't think... It's fine. - Yeah. Mm. There's no alcohol in that, but I don't have anywhere else to go because Amy dumped me. Hmm. And I can't live with Patrick because, unlike me, he has a life. Okay. Just because I have a steady income and a mortgage and I do Taekwondo on Mondays and Thursdays... Oldest in the class... Oh! Doesn't mean I have a life. The worst part is, the ghosts, they don't want my soul. They must have tried it on and said, "This one sucks," you know? Oh! Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It's okay, it's okay. Uh, I'm sure that any ghost would be lucky to have your soul. Right? I mean, they just don't know what they're missing out on. - Really? - Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Aimee. That's really nice. - I'm sorry. I didn't know anything about... that. It's okay. Um... Yeah. Actually, in college, I used to cleanse houses of all sorts of... spirits and negative energies and stuff. - Really? - Really? Aimee, now, listen, I need a cleansing. I need it tonight because I don't know how much longer I can take this. Please. Can you help me? Help me, please. Please. Okay. This is it. Sometimes they, uh, start being annoying around 3:15 in the morning, but other days, they just kind of start whenever. There are no ghosts. Oh. Oh, I'm definitely sensing something. Um... - Is it that ghost boy? He's really starting to piss me off. Mm. It's coming from the basement. Ooh, yeah He likes to hide in there. Yeah. Okay. And... Is there a girl's room? Is there a little girl? Yeah, there was a little girl, yes. O-Okay. Yeah, sure. There was a little girl that lived here. That's a great guess. But there are no ghosts. Mm. If you're not gonna help, just go home, okay? 'Cause I'm tired of these ghosts jumping out of nowhere and demanding sacrifices and playing piano better than me. Okay? I'm gonna end it. Or, well, Aimee is gonna end it. Yeah. Right? - Yeah. - Yes. Good. Yeah. Okay. Do you have any sage? Or salt. I'm gonna need sage and salt. Yeah. I... Well, I do. I was gonna use those for some scones tomorrow... - Stalling. - I'm not stalling. Shut up. No. Okay. We are gonna do the cleansing in the girl's room. I need you to get the sage and the salt. Yes. So, are you gonna use all of that, or...? It's cool. I can get more. Okay, good. Uh, what... what kind is it? - No, no. - So, Aimee... how did you learn how to do cleansings, exactly? My roommate in college was really into crystals and palm readings, and, I mean, it paid the bills. So, why do you work with Patrick, then, if you can make money doing really cool ghost stuff? Uh, we lost control during a seance, and that's when I decided to... take a more conventional path with my life. Oh. What happens when you lose control? Well, spirits take over the house, wreak havoc. - Oh. - That's not so bad. I mean, my spirits are doing that anyways. They will burn demonic symbols into your flesh, curse you, blind you, possess you, turn you against your loved ones. Yeah, it can get pretty dark. I promised myself that I would never do it again. Then, uh, what are we doing right now, exactly? Oh, no, this isn't a seance. This is just a cleansing. Totally safe. Okay? - Yeah, totally. Hey, uh, Will, just one second? - What? - Hey, uh... remember what I said about inner demons, Will? You can't hide from them forever. And now you're trying to get Aimee from accounting into this. She's the only other person at work who likes that weird deli by the office. Okay? I can't lose my lunch, buddy. I can't. -Okay, okay. Hey, if you like her so much, why don't you ask her out? Come on. Hold my hand. O-o-o-o-oh, spirits! Oh, God. You must release yourself from the confines of this house. You are not welcome. Mm. Yay! You did it. I think they're gone. Let's go back to the bar to celebrate. Oh, no, no. Unh-unh. The spirits have heard me, but they haven't left yet. O-o-o-o-oh, spirits. You are no longer of this world. You must release yourself from the confines of this earthly home. It belongs to Will... server of toothpaste customers. Baker of baked goods. And... You know, I'm actually still kind of trying to figure that out. We can... We can skip this part. But thank you. You're doing great. Okay. Anyway, spirits, it belongs to the living, and I cast you out! Uh... There's gotta be a window open or... something. I'll go close it. There's a demon in this house. My cleansing was for... It was for ghosts. Like, the spirits haven't moved on. How different can it be, you know? Whoa! Oh! Aimee! Aimee? Aimee? Uh... be okay. Patrick! Uh, okay. Don't move. Stay right here. I'll be back. Patrick? Patrick? Aimee's passed out in the other room. We gotta go. We got to get her to a hospital, like, now. You know, Deominous wanted Will to leave. But Will didn't listen. Will brought his friends. Friends Deominous could possess. Deominous, seriously, Patrick is a nerd. You don't want him. Deominous likes nerds! Hey! Deominous, open the door! Patrick?! Patrick? Come on! Not this time, ghost. Unh! I hate those stairs. Patrick? Or Deominous? Patrick... your best human friend. Okay, Patrick. Aimee needs our help, okay? We gotta get her out of here. And you're the responsible one, remember? You're the one always telling me to do the right thing over the easy thing. I don't think I want to do that any more. I think I want to let the lady suffer. Hang out with Deominous instead. That sounds fun. It... Yeah, that... I think that could be... All right. Yeah, we'll just do that. No, we're not gonna do that! Get off me! You smell really bad. -And you are weak. Patrick works out. I know! No, no! Please, please, please! Please, don't! No, no... Aah! Your brittle bones are no match for Deominous. Aah! Patrick? -Hey, demon! You're not of this world. You must release your essence from the confines of the living! Patrick! I cast you out! - Unh! - Nice. - See that? That's how you cast out a demon. It's totally different. You okay? Good. I'm gonna sit down. Ohh. We're gonna go to the hospital, and you're gonna come back and live with me for a while. - What? Aimee fixed it. She... saved us. I'm not gonna live with you. You're not saying you want to come back and live here? You know, you... you and Amy have been on my case for years about what I'm supposed to do with my life. This might be it. What is "it," exactly? Guard the world from demons and... and stay here and keep him from, you know, getting out of the house. Are you listening to yourself? Guys, stop! This is really dangerous territory. I don't know how strong that demon is. It could come right back. Well, then I'll just cast it out again, you know? Like you did. Like, "Begone, demon! Get out of my house!" It's paraphrasing, but it's pretty spot on, right? No, what I'm saying, Will, is that it could come back and it could try to kill someone. That demon is looking for a sacrifice to take to Hell. Oh, well, doesn't want me. And no one's gonna be here except me. Okay. So you're just gonna avoid everyone else forever? That's your big life plan? Yeah, Patrick, that's the plan. As long as that nice family let me stay here, sure. Why not? I mean, what else do I have going on for me? Okay. Just come to the hospital with us, and then, you can do whatever you want. I'm not gonna stop you. But, dude, I can see the bone sticking out of your arm right now. Okay. You good? Amy? Hey. Hey. What are you doing? - This is weird. I'm like... holding a rock, and you're broken. Oh. I don't know if I would say it like that. No, I meant your arm is broken. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So it's true. What did you hear? Patrick just told me that you were in an accident and that you're in the hospital. - Yeah. - I tried to call you, but, um, you didn't answer, and I... Well, I just... Could I come inside? Sure. Sure. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Uh... Um... I'm sorry. Actually, I don't know if it's a good idea. Yeah, right. Well, I'm glad that you're okay. - Thanks for... for coming. - Yeah. Okay. Cast out... Let's open this house. Oh, my God. Hey. Oh. Uh... I'm sorry. I was... I was gonna get it. It's just, the cast is, um... I'm still figuring it out. - Right. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Here. -Uh, wait, Amy. I'm sorry. It's... It's too... It's too dangerous. Just... Just relax, okay? I'm just here to check on you... as a friend. So... So... So, how's Nick? Oh, um... Yeah, we went out a couple times. - You're in love. It's okay. - No, no, no. Um... It was fine. I just... I... I didn't really feel it, you know? Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's how it goes sometimes. Have you been seeing anyone? Seeing, like, dating or, like, spirits? Dating is what you meant. No. Nope. - Are you okay? - What? - Are you on painkillers? - What? No. I mean, yes, a little, but I'm... I'm good. Nothing's wrong, uh, and everything is fine. Okay. Well, then... I should probably go since you're not in trouble... - Oh. - ...or anything. - Uh, wait. Hey, Amy, wait. Um, m-maybe... You know, since we appeared to actually be alone...

I'll check on it now. ♪ We're on the right track ♪ We're on the right track Um... yeah. It's, um... Yeah, it's a lot better. Maybe we can... try again? Maybe we can start over, Charlie. -It's too late now. You have Rick. Forget Rick. What we had is real. We're connected. We're meant to end up together. We're soul mates. - Can I ask you something? - Yeah, s-sure. You can ask me... You can ask me anything. Why didn't you go with me? The night we... broke up. You just never told me, and I just... I need closure. Closure. Right. It's just... I thought you were my best friend, and I thought you would be happy for me. I was. I-I am. I am. Um... And if closure is what would make you... happy... Then... - What are you doing? - Okay. Imagine this. We've just bumped into each other on the street and stopped for a dramatic moment of realization that we haven't seen each other in, like, a while. It's like years... Time has passed, right? You know, I've been... I've been doing things, been working on stuff, finishing up some projects. That part actually is true, by the way. But anyways, I'd stop, and I'd see you, and I'd say, "Amy, is that you?" -Seriously? You'd forget what I look like? Well, no, it's be... Because I'm... I'm on my way to a very important meeting for my super profitable candlemaking, woodworking, cake-making business that I've just been, you know, just fully committed to. Will, please tell me you threw away those disgusting candles. They're so bad. I did not. I still have them all. But, no, then you'd say, "Will... have you been working out?" And I would say, "Yeah. Just ran a marathon this morning." - A whole marathon? - Yeah, a whole marathon. You know, because it's just very important to me that I impress you with the things that future me will do but hasn't done yet. Okay, I know what I would say next. "Oh, Will! Is that you?" Dang. You forgot what I looked like, too. "I didn't see you over my grand opening for my brand-new business and my Nobel Prize for solving global warming with the new flavor of ice cream I created." - How exactly does that work? - So, it's ice cream. - Mm-hmm. - It recools the Earth. - New flavor of ice cream? - Mm-hmm. - And you won a Nobel Prize. - Mm-hmm. Your stuff's way cooler than mine. -You forgot about my business. It's okay. Oh. No, I... I didn't forget about that. You're actually gonna do that. That was supposed to make you feel better. Um... Supposed to make you feel happy. I'm... I'm sorry if I messed it up. Well, I want you to be happy, too. And if you're happy here... with all of your hobbies, then I am glad. I really am. I'm... I'm not happy. I'm not happy at all. Except right now. - What's wrong? - Oh. Nothing. Amy... the reason Patrick told you I was in trouble is because there are... Or, were... ghosts... living in the house. And a demon. Uh, yeah, and I was just gonna, you know, just stay here and guard the world from any returning evil spirits and whatnot, just because... I don't know. I just thought if I was living alone, I might as well be doing something productive. Right? Yeah, uh... Anyway, I was just wondering... I mean, uh, you know, it's... it's like you... it's like you said... you either feel it or you don't. And this feels right to me. Does it feel right to you, too? No. Oh. Okay. Amy never loved you. Amy felt sorry for you. And now Amy... is mine. Aah! No? Okay. I know, I know. I can do it. Okay. Hey, demon, I... You know, it's not cool for you to take living people's bodies, man. And I banish you... ...out of my ex but maybe future girlfriend Amy. Amy? Hey, Amy, are you okay? That was the worst demon cleansing Deominous has ever heard. And Deominous has been cast out of a lot of bodies. Amy? Come back over here! Come back over here! No. No, no! No, no. Amy, stop it. I-I know you told me I can't miss any more nights, but I've been going through a lot, personally, and... - Do you know the procedure? - Yes. No, I know. I know the procedure. Yeah. Sorry. It's, um... It's my boss. He's just really mad because I haven't really been on my... My A game at work lately, and I promised that I would work tonight, and, um, I'm trying to get out of it. - Raah! - Okay. I, um... I printed these. The Internet has a lot of great tips about how to exorcise demons. - Raah! - It says to start by drawing a protective circle. We're gonna protect up. Here, watch your feet. Okay. So, uh, okay. Draw protective symbols that represent virtue. Okay. Here, watch your feet. What? No... No, please. No, stop. You're messing up my... It's okay. Oh, something's working. Oh, I... Yes. No, I was listening. No, sir, I wasn't. Please don't transfer me to H.R. Please don't... I'm on hold now. Awesome. -I made this. See, demons hate these. So just, here, take it. It's okay. It'll be good. Here, really. Just take it. It's okay. In the hand. Here, just... Sorry! I'm sorry! Hello? Hi! Help! I mean, no, hi. I'm Will. I'm here to help... He's lying. Oh, he's lying. Yes, I did go off script the other night a little bit, but I did not say that Presto Paste was the official toothpaste of Satan. What was that? That's the TV. Sorry. It's the little TV. Amy will be sacrificed! Amy will be taken to Hell. Amy's soul belongs to Deominous. Well, yeah, that's pretty bad. But please, um, don't fire me. This is all I have. No, please. Stay. What?! Are you guys here to interfere with my life some more? Ever since the cleansing, I've been connected with the energy here. I can feel some kind of... domestic disturbance. Lost love... possessed by darkness. Doesn't sound like anything going on here. Is that Amy? Tied up in the living room? Oh, my God, Will. Oh, my God! What did you do?! We're complicit now. You realize that, right? The police are gonna question us, and I can't lie to the police, Will. You're not in court! And no one's going to trial or Hell. I didn't do anything. It's all Deominous's fault. Things were going so well with Amy. And then Deominous showed up... - What?! ...and possessed her soul and ruined everything. Okay, well, we have to get in there. - We have to help her. - No. Why, why? You guys don't... You don't think I can do this on my own? You don't think I can win her back from Deominous with true love? No. You can't. Listen, that whole 3:15 a.m. thing, that's what a gateway to Hell can open. So if Deominous has successfully possessed someone, all he has to do is open that portal at 3:15 to take them... forever. Are you saying Amy's gonna die? We don't have a lot of time. Let's save her together. Okay? Yeah. Okay. Oh, she... - Oh, God. -She was just here. You guys saw her. Oh, she took my headset. "Save your loved ones from the demons of Hell in three easy steps." Yeah, it seemed easy enough. Besides, you guys already burned all my sage and stuff. "The first step is to take away their rock and roll music." Okay. Yeah. I said it was easy. Amy? We gotta find her. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Is this because you never liked my pottery? Whoa! Okay! Okay! You can destroy all my hobbies! We just want Amy's, uh, soul? Amy's soul is mine. Come on. Unh! I should've told you about that. Man... - Ugh! - Oh, yeah. Sorry. I-I knew about that, too. Is there anything else you want to tell us? Hello? Ghosts? Demons? Goblins? Oh! Uh, hi, Will I didn't think you'd still be here. You knew. Why didn't you tell me about Deominous before I rented your house? Sorry. We're sorry, okay? But you were supposed to be the sacrifice instead of our sweet Grace. -Oh, yeah? Well, the joke's on you because the demon didn't even want me. Nope. He decided to possess everybody I love instead. And he's got my ex-girlfriend in the basement right now! That doesn't sound like a joke. - Who are these people? - We're his friends. But you said you didn't have any friends. Okay, everybody calm down. Sellers family... I forgive you for trying to sacrifice my soul. Now let's focus on the task at hand... Rescuing the love of my life, Amy. But I don't want to rescue her. I want someone to be sacrificed so we can live in our house again. Shh! Shh! No one's getting sacrificed tonight, Ken. Got it? That's not going to happen. Ohh! Ohh! Hey! Will! Just stay there! We'll figure something out. I think I gotta do this alone. Will... you have to be prepared that you might not get her back. I know. I know. - We have to perform a seance. - Right. I mean, no, absolutely not. You said that's dangerous. But Will and Amy are stuck in that basement, and the only chance that they have is if we can somehow figure out a way to sever the link between Deominous and those spirits. Please. Let's do this together. Right? Okay. Yeah. Cool. You guys just hang out or whatever. We're gonna need a way to communicate. Something analog. Uh, a tape recorder, candles, cushions... a spirit board. Will has those gross candles upstairs. -I have cushions. They're vintage silk. Tammy, don't engage. I have a board that can connect us with the dead. Why do you need to talk to ghosts, Jake? God, you're so weird. That just leaves the tape recorder. Does this work? -Don't give up! You're doing awesome! Ugh. You should feel it right in your glutes. Whatever this is, we're gonna have to tape over it. - Something smells... - Terrible? It's the candles... mixed with demon stench. Can we just get this over with? Oh, spirits... if you have occupied this house, if you have terrorized and annoyed those living here, we summon you back. We summon you to face us. And we'd like to make an appeal to keep Will and Amy in the custody of the living. Please. Thank you. Your Honor. Aah! Where do you keep coming from?! Just leave me alone, please! Amy. Or... Deominous. You can send as many ghosts as you want to try to stop me. They're really scary, but I'm not gonna let Amy down this time. Can you tell her that? Guess not. Clearly, you got your own thing going on with that... hole. Uh... But it doesn't matter, because if you take Amy to Hell, then I'm coming to hell, too. Yeah, you're gonna be stuck with me. Spirits, are you standing behind Grace right now? No. Are you in the house? Yes. We know that Deominous has used you, possessed you into doing evil. We want to help. How do we banish Deominous forever so that you can return to the afterlife in peace? Spirits... why won't you answer? The... girl. Something about Grace? What is it? What's wrong with her? Nothing! She's perfect! De... ominous... poss... essed... two... living... souls. No. No. He's the woman in the basement. He doesn't want Grace. Wrong, Daddy. - Grace! - No! Wait! Amy, please, we're running out of time! Oh, shit! What was that? It's just... It's just toothpaste. Ohh, God! Has your sister been possessed by Deominous before? Yeah, but the demon said he'd let Grace go if... Wait, wait, wait. You can't bargain with a demon. He's gonna take everything. That can't be legal. Look! Spirits, are you standing behind Grace right now? Are you in the house? We know that Deominous has used you, possessed you into doing evil. We want to help. How do we banish Deominous forever so that you can return to the afterlife in peace? Destroy object. Demon-made. Okay! That's why! That's why they weren't answering on the board. It's 'cause they knew that Deominous was listening through Grace. Oh, uh, hey. Do... Do you need some help? Uh, it's... it's okay. It's... It's... It's not that. - Yeah. It's just kind of a one-man job. -Yeah. No, no, it's stupid anyway. Hyah! Holy shit. Let's go. I'm wiping it all off. It's okay. It's fine. It's fine. It's not fine. It's horrible! Oh, my God. Ohh! What are you guys doing? Huh? What are you doing? You do everything Deominous says. You let him in over and over, just do whatever he wants you to do. And for what? What do you get? He gets a sacrifice. And you get nothing. You do all this stuff, and it means nothing. Amy? Amy... What... I'm doing nothing. Will... I'm here. Okay. What kind of thing would a demon make? Oh! No, Will made that. Cheese board. But if the ghost wanted to help us, why are they helping the demon? -Well, they're not good or bad. They're just dead. But once Deominous possessed their spirit form, he can kind of use them to do whatever he wants. I think he might be overextending himself right now. - Like Will with his hobbies. - Exactly. Deominous is splitting himself between the other Amy, Grace, and the spirits. This could be our chance to stop him. This is it, right? Pottery class. Really? Aah! Aah! Oh, my God! Ohh! Hey. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Uh... does this Will guy make cakes? Yeah. Except for one. Amy? You said you wanted closure. Here just... just hold on just a second, please. Just stop. Just... I just... I gotta tell you something. Um... There's so many great things you're gonna do. And you're so sure of yourself and where you're going. And... I was scared to go with you that night because I thought if I went, you'd see just how much your life's moving forward and... how you deserve more than me. So I'm not gonna keep holding on to you. Will? Hey! Hey. I thought... I thought you were gone forever. 'Cause you were digging that hole forever. Digging what? - Wait! - No. I'm not quitting this time, okay? Everyone's getting out of this. That demon's going back to Hell, and you and I... You know, we'll... whatever you want. I'm very... casual and open. Oh, my God! Oh, Amy. This is Aimee. She spells her name with two E's. Hi. Um, so, Grace is Deominous now. What should we do? - Deominous could not listen to Will's little speech anymore. You made him so mushy and gross! He can have his girlfriend back! - Oh, we're not... - We're not toge... - Are... No, we're not. - Look! She's digging a hole to Hell or something, man. I've never seen anything like that. I have. My rotten tooth, remember? It was covered in nasty plaque just like this. Plaque? Oh, my parents stopped buying that stuff. Tastes like shit. They changed the formula, Jake. All right, yeah. Aah! Deominous already has a sacrifice. You cannot save Grace now. It is over. Aah! That did not look cool! And now Deominous has to dig another hole! Don't listen to her, man! That was awesome. That was... That was one of the coolest things I've ever seen you do. It was? Also, I kicked the shit out of a door upstairs. - Nice. - Deominous! I cast you out of Grace Sellers! No! Then I banish you to an object of your creation! Oh! That, right? No! - Will! - Amy! Hyah! Aah! It didn't work. It didn't work... We did it. Where's Mom and Dad? Right here. We got trapped in the guest room. It was awful. But we survived. But... what about the ghosts? Well, we destroyed the object containing Deominous's spirit, so they're free to move on to the next realm. I guess they're happy here. Oh, no. No, no. This is our house. The demon left, so they have to go, too. Do something! I can't. They're at peace. Over my dead body. That's my remote, my TV, my house! Hi. What? It's just what you said. You didn't give up on me or that girl or... any of it. Come on. - Hey. - Hey. - Um, your cake looks amazing. - Thank you. I'm sure you made some extravagant cake that's gonna put all ours to shame. Oh, what? No. No, no, no. Ken. And this is the living room. -I know. I'm selling you the house. Orange belt. Nice. - Mom, can we go play? - Yeah. Happy saving you from the demon who wanted to take your soul to Hell Anniversary. Yeah. That one's, uh, for you. Oh, dude, the whole cake's for Amy? Oh, no, I mean, everyone can have some. Um, Ken, did you want to try some cake? You think some cake is gonna make up for you letting those damn ghosts ruin our property value? -Come on. You know, they don't... They don't know any better. You can't blame them for being... Ohh! You just gotta let them do what they're gonna do. I mean, take this guy, for example. He loves dark little corners and closets. Don't you, bud? Yeah. You see the shirt he's wearing? I'm not getting it back for an eternity. He told me that... in Latin. I got a Latin dictionary. No, no! And he's not getting his creepy little toy horse thingy back. Two can play at this game. Kids. Just great. Sign here, and this nightmare house and all the terrible things in it are yours. Okeydokey. So it's been a year? That's what you're celebrating? And six months since we started our business. It was Will's idea. And his toothpaste overstock. We just bought the rights from Presto Paste when they changed their formula back, and I got to bust out the old patent acquisition contract. What a rush. Great. Have a wonderful life. I hope we never meet again. Until you need to close a Hell portal. Sorry. - We'll call you. I can't find Grace anywhere. Grace?! Grace?! Sorry. I was listening to this. Can I keep it? Yeah. Does it feel weird to part with that thing? No, I never want to see it again. Maybe it was a good thing we went through all of that. Yeah. In a way, I'm kind of glad it happened. - I'm not. - Well, I think we can all be glad that he never found a vessel that would allow him to leave the house. - Yeah. - Yeah. That would be terrible.
