Where from? - Champagne. (tense instrumental music) - I got family there. I'll come to see you. (tense instrumental music) Turn around. Let me have some, too. (tense instrumental music) (phone beeps) - [Man Voiceover] I'm on call. (discordant, tinny instrumental music) - Just think of me when you stick your dirty dick inside her pussy. You fucking closet-case. You'll get yours. AIDS, baby. I'm gonna report you to the manager. (tense instrumental music) (pounding) - Cocksuckers, put some money in the machine or get the fuck out of there! (brooding instrumental music) - Good job. (dramatic instrumental music) (moves into creeping, jazzy instrumental music) - What? - A little more coffee? - No, it'll keep me up late. - Well, we certainly wouldn't want that. - No, it's, uh, I got a big meeting tomorrow morning. - I know. How did your meeting go tonight? Any luck? - Some. - Some? - Yeah, some luck. - Well tell me about it, Kevin. I', I'm all atwitter. - Some client from Champagne. - Oh, Champagne. - Yeah, that's what I said. Champagne. - I know what you said, Kevin. (spoon rattles) (jazzy instrumental music) Male or female? - A man. - Kevin. - Gwen. - Tell me I'm the only one. (discordant instrumental music) - What do you mean? - [Gwen] Are you seeing someone? - No. No, I'm not. - I wanna believe you, Kevin. What a relief. (traffic hums) - [Kevin] Frank. - If you guys are still busy in here, I'll come back later. - No, not necessary, Mr. Mars. I think I'm all done here. Back to the old grindstone. - Grindstone? What grindstone? You work in an art gallery. - Oh, back to making phone calls anyway. Find a home for these babies. - I see. Oh, if you stay late tonight, double-lock the door and set the alarm. I'm getting really paranoid. - Will do. Uh, Frank, do you think I could hit you up for, like, 60 bucks? - Where is your wallet? - I seem to have misplaced it. - The company credit card was stolen? - I, I'll cancel it. - I will. (phone rings) - Mars Gallery. Mars Gallery. Hello? Thanks, Frank. - Who was that? - Uh, wrong number, uh, hung up. - I had two of those this morning. - Crazy. - Don't get into any trouble. - Who, me? (tense instrumental music) - Yes, hello, this is Frank Mars with Mars Gallery. Yes, we have a security account, right. Yes, I'd like to upgrade the system. - [Fast Food Worker] I'm sorry, can I help you? - [Kevin] Yeah, a double cheeseburger, please. - [Fast Food Worker] Anything else? - [Kevin] That's it. How ya doin'? Thank you. (tense instrumental music) - [Fast Food Worker] Thank you. - Thank you. (tense instrumental music) (moves into melancholic instrumental music) (moves into pulsing instrumental music) (phone rings) - [Man Voiceover] Hello. - Hi, Brian, um, this is Gwen, Kevin's wife. - [Brian] Sorry, lady, I think you have the wrong number. - Um, I, I found your number on a, a matchbook that, that was in my husband's suit pocket. - [Brian] Okay. - Um, he, he didn't come, he didn't come home last night. And, and I was wondering if, if you had seen him. Um, he, he's kind of dark, uh, with, with scruff on his, on his face. - [Brian] Um, oh, yeah! That was that hottie with the big dick. That's what I call an uber-top. - What's an uber-top? Oh. I see. (chuckles) Well, I, I guess that just, that makes me a bottom. - [Brian] (chuckles) Join the club, honey. Kind of glad you called. Makes me feel like I have a sister. - Um, so, hey, that little brown bottle, uh, filled with liquid with the really unpleasant smell. What, what is that? - [Brian] Poppers, girl. Poppers is a liquid gay sex addicts sniff when they're getting fucked. It enhances the sexual experience. Sort of gives you a queer rush. - What's to say heterosexuals don't use it? You know what, you're very opinionated. You don't even know what you're talking about! - [Brian] If so, has he ever used it with you? - No. - [Brian] How long has it been? A year? Two? Those matches you found are from the Macho Steamroller. - Macho Steamroller? That, that sounds like a train. - [Brian] It's a train all right, a choo choo train of saunas for homosexuals who have sex indiscriminately, but I'll spare you the details. We are talking slings, group sex, tops, bottoms, glory holes. Do you have any idea what a glory hole is, my dear? - No. What is a glory hole? - [Brian] A glory hole, dear, is a baseball-size circle that is drilled into the partition of two booths, intended to facilitate sucking cock. That is where I met your husband. Yes, ma'am, he was hot to trot, a real stud. I remember his face. So brutally handsome. - (chuckles) You are a dreamer. My husband might have fantasies but he would never act upon them. He may have entertained the thought but he would never go through with it. (dildo thumps) This is what I call wishful thinking, sir. Eat your heart out. My husband does not engage with your kind. I know him better than you do. - Oh yeah? So what was my number doing in his pocket, Cuntella? - You slipped it in there, dick eater. - Wanna get coffee sometime? (dramatic, percussive instrumental music) (moves into shimmering instrumental music) (moves into percussive instrumental music) - Gwen? - [Gwen] Suck that twat. - What are you doing? - [Gwen] On your knees, faggot. - Have you lost your mind? - I wanted to turn you on. I wanted to put the spark back. I don't even know what to do anymore. - Gwen, don't ever do this again. Let's go to bed. You look like a freak. - I feel so rejected. - You have nothin' to worry about, Gwen. I'm yours, baby. Yours alone. (brooding instrumental music) (phone rings) Hello? - I have your wallet. Are you aware of that? - How'd you get this number? Uh, um, no, I, I didn't even realize, uh, I lost it. Okay, uh, where? Where are you? - In the warehouse. - Uh, oh, well thank you, thank you, uh, thanks a lot. I'll go get it now. - Come horny. (panting) - Some guy found my wallet. - When did you lose your wallet? - At the gas station. The guy was nice enough to, uh, to grab it. I better go get it. - Okay, well, I could use some air, I'll come with you. - Gwen, it's late. You should stick around and just, just stay here. - No, I, I'd rather come with you. (panting) - Fine, get dressed. Let's go. - Okay. - Aren't you gonna be cold? - No. I feel surprisingly warm. - [Kevin] Let's go. (suspenseful instrumental music) You open 24 hours? - [Attendant] Yes, indeed, young man. - Thank you very much. - [Attendant] Have a good night. (suspenseful instrumental music) - Well, did you get it? - Uh, no, the guy who took it, took it home with him. We'll have to go there and get it. - [Gwen] All right. (suspenseful instrumental music) - I'll be back in a jiffy. - Well, can I come, too? I, I'd like to thank him. He did such a wonderful thing, finding your wallet and all. - Stop clinging, Gwen. One thing I cannot stand is a clinging vine. I need space, Gwen. I need to be trusted. (suspenseful instrumental music) - Leave it open. If we're lucky, maybe we'll have an audience. (tense instrumental music) Take your clothes off. (tense instrumental music) You'll have to crawl for it. - On this floor? - Yeah. There's a reward and the end of this tunnel. (pulsing instrumental music) Get to it. (pulsing instrumental music) Slither toward me like a lizard. (pulsing instrumental music) - Can you touch me? I just wanna feel. I need to feel. (pulsing instrumental music) (screaming) - Who are you? - [Kevin] Just a very lonely man. - We're done. - Early bird catches the worm. What's the scoop? - Uh, nah, just came in early to catch up on some stuff. - You're a dedicated man, Kevin. Can I tell you something? - Um, yeah, shoot. - I was thinking of making you a full-time partner. - Frank, I, I, I don't know what to say. - A simple thank you will do. - Thank you. - Great, I'm taking you to lunch. We can talk and celebrate. What's this? - I moved out. - No. - I'll explain to ya later. In the meantime, can I leave my stuff here? - Where would you be staying, here? - For a little while, until I find a nice place. - People don't usually move into their offices when they're changing apartments. But, hey, for you, of course. It's okay. We're a family. See ya. Don't forget to turn on the alarm if you leave. - Hey. - [Man Voiceover] Hey. - How fast can you be here? - [Man Voiceover] You'll have to pick me up. - I'll be there in 15. (traffic hums) (dramatic instrumental music) Will you see me again? - Finish me off first. Then we'll talk. (soft moaning) (dramatic instrumental music) (moves into light instrumental music) - Morning, Kevin. (beeping) - Uh, morning, Frank. - I'll be in my office. (beeping) Hello? - [Man Voiceover] Mars Gallery? - This is Frank Mars. - [Man Voiceover] This is Sergeant Driver calling from security. We had an entry at a suspicious hour. - That's okay. Kevin, my partner, he's a workaholic. I wouldn't worry about it. - [Sgt. Driver] That's good to hear. You said Kevin? (discordant instrumental music) - [Frank] Kevin, yes. Is that all? - [Sgt. Driver] Well, there were two gentlemen going in. You might wanna look at the tape before you close this file. - Thank you. (tense instrumental music) Hi. - Hey. - What time did you get in last night? - It was late. Why? - Were you alone? - Of course, uh. Who would I be with? - Oh, I don't know. A young man, 'bout 20. - Frank, where would you, where would you get that? - It's all on tape. - You had cameras installed? - You bet. With all the hang-up calls we've been getting, had me kind of worried. But, lo and behold, surprise, surprise, my friend, my friend has been sneaking in street trash. - Frank. - You have been the biggest disappointment of my life. And I'm sure I'm not alone. Pack your shit and get out. - Frank, can I have a couple days? - No, no. - [Kevin] At least to find a place. - No. Kevin, good luck, (speaks foreign language). - Family, huh? When life seemed out of control, I hit rock bottom. As I walked away from the smoldering ashes of my previous existence, I noticed a homeless man begging right down the road. As he was begging for coins, I stopped and looked. - Please, help me, please. - [Kevin] And gave. I looked into his eyes, and as he stared back, I suddenly heard a voice whispering in my head. - God bless you, child. - [Kevin] Here by the grace of God go I. And, suddenly, nothing seemed that bad anymore. It was sort of okay, for now. - [Homeless Man] God bless you. (tinny jazz music cutting in and out) - [Man Voiceover] To it. (beeping) - [Woman Voiceover] What have you been doing? (beeping) - [Announcer] And now for the evening's news. A young man was found murdered tonight in an alley which is known to be a popular cruising area for homosexuals. The man was strangled with what appeared to be a rosary, making this the fourth death in what has now been dubbed The Rosary Killings. Police Inspector Tim Deer says that officers are working around the clock on this case, but that no real leads have been found. He, meanwhile, warns people to stay out of dark alleys and parking lots after dark. And, if approached by any suspicious persons, leave the area immediately and contact the police.

I know you're there. You're never anywhere else this time on a Sunday night, so will you stop this and pick up the phone? Are you really not going to answer? Fine, be like that. Look, just give me a call back, okay? It's been almost a week since we saw each other and I really do miss you. Well, have a good night. I'll talk to you soon. I love you. I mean that. (gentle instrumental music) (banging) (gentle instrumental music) (banging) (gentle instrumental music) (moves into brassy instrumental music) - [Announcer] Now for the evening's news. The body of an unidentified man, approximately 25 years of age, was discovered strangled to death in an alley in the city's Humboldt Park neighborhood. Police say the crime might have been the result of a sexual altercation and that it is unclear as to whether the murder was self-defense or not. This incident, however, marks the third in a series of murders of young Caucasian males in the Humboldt Park neighborhood that have been dubbed recently The Rosary Killings. Police, however, have not commented as to whether this crime is actually related to the previous two. (jangling instrumental music) - [Blake Voiceover] A broken television lying motionless in the mud where it happened. I feel like a coward for having run from him. It wasn't his actions which frightened me. It was the pleasure that I felt watching. And I tried to hide the pleasure. I tried to make it into something else. Tried to make it into horror or revulsion. Had I stayed, maybe I could've proven myself as powerful as him.

I must see him again. I must show that I won't betray our desires. He.

(gentle instrumental music) (moves into percussive instrumental music) (grunting) (squishing) (gentle instrumental music) (siren wails) - Commissioner, please help me to understand. There is some psycho out there performin' some bizarre rituals, leaving you tons of clues, and the best you have is what? - [Commissioner] Let's just face it, this is not an everyday occurrence. In my opinion-- - No kidding! You're talkin' to me like I'm some kind of stupid schoolgirl. (Commissioner chuckles) Let me bring in a sex crimes expert, Danny Davidovitch. Now, Danny Davidovitch, level with me here, okay? Do we have a description? Commissioner, do we have a description? - Someone saw him and came forward. - [Interviewer] Yes or no? - [Commissioner] Yes, we have a description. - Now my inside sources say that the victim had some metal residue on their teeth. What is going on? - We are not sure where the metal originated. - Let me switch to Mr. Davidovitch, a specialist in sex crimes. Mr. Davidovitch, the metal traces, any clue? - Cock ring. - Excuse me? - He makes them choke on the cock ring. This is why they didn't inflict damage on the penis. They can't. This, this is a clever one, I might say. - [Interviewer] Please help me to understand. - Well, for starters, it wouldn't be wise to air all that so publicly. All he has to do now is change his appearance and get lost in the crowd, ready to kill again. ("Organ Toccata" by J.S. Bach) - [Driver] Hey, baby. How's it goin'? - Hi. - [Driver] 20 bucks? It'll be fun. Come on, 20 bucks. - Fuck you. - [Driver] Hey. ("Organ Toccata" by J.S. Bach) - Hi. ("Organ Toccata" by J.S. Bach) - Hi, sweetie. - Hi. - So, um, uh, so what do you like? - Oh, I don't know. I like to get sucked off by queers. - Uh, so, so you think I'm queer? - You really didn't think I was a real woman, did ya, sweetie? - No, I, I, I guess not. You see, I've always liked girls with something extra. I just didn't think it made me queer. ("Organ Toccata" by J.S. Bach) Well, home sweet home. I'm a designer. Here, come this way. Have a seat. Uh, do you want something to drink? - Milk. (foreboding instrumental music) Thanks. - Um, uh, I'm going to change into something more comfortable. (tense instrumental music) Ta da! - Nice. (dramatic instrumental music) (gagging and groaning) (dramatic instrumental music) (moves into discordant instrumental music) ♫ Blue moon ♫ You saw me standing alone ♫ Without a dream in my heart (pulsing electronic music) - I have here the Police Commissioner of the city of Chicago, Mr. Nie Rifkin. We just heard that another body has been found in a high rise. This one was discovered by the cleaning lady, who called the police. So now, Chief, what do we have now? - The facts are a little bit hazy, Nancy, but, um, we're not sure if the two are connected. - Am I hearing this right? My inside sources say that the choking method was identical to that first murder. Now, I am not a policewoman. I am a TV reporter, and I can tell you that this is the same person, the same killer. What are you doing about catching this sicko, Chief? - There are traces of lipsticks on a glass, but we're not-- - Hold on, I don't believe it! Are you telling me that there's a woman involved? Maybe even a drag queen? Who is the investigating officer on this case? Frank, uh, something. Obviously not very effective. Maybe you should hire me. (Commissioner laughs) - We've assigned this case to Captain Frank Olive. He's the very best we have. He's been transferred from Milwaukee, and he's a renowned expert in sex crimes. - Okay, so you have some hotshot detective from Milwaukee. What was his name, Frank Olive? Yeah, okay. You say that he's the best that you have? Isn't that so, Commissioner? - Yes, ma'am, Frank Olive is the very best. - We already have three or four killings, and your man of the hour is the best you have? God help us all, Commissioner. There is a killer at large, guys. Why isn't the whole city flooded with vice cops and decoys? I mean, how many gay cruising areas are there? Hello! - Ma'am, like I said, Frank and his taskforce are on it. - Then maybe we should have Frank Olive come on the show, how 'bout that? (Commissioner chuckles) - Unfortunately, Frank is not available for comment. But Lieutenant Chandler, who's been working side-by-side with him, is available right now. - Officer Chandler, what are you doing to catch this psycho? - Well, Nancy, I can't really disclose our methods at this time. However, I'm working with Frank Olive, and he is by far the best of the best. This man's a great guy, a great detective, he knows what he's doing. Now, we will catch this guy, and, honestly, I hope you're listening out there because we will find you. You can run, but you can't hide. Your days are numbered. (percussive instrumental music) (gagging) (dramatic instrumental music) (pulsing) (grunting) (pulsing, dramatic instrumental music) - Hey. - [Killer] Rum and coke, please. - Rum and coke. (dramatic instrumental music) (moves into angelic choral music) (moves into gentle, ominous instrumental music) (gagging) (gentle instrumental music) - [Killer] I'm sorry. I really liked you. (melancholic instrumental music) (moves into angelic choral music) (moves into melancholic instrumental music) - Well, good evening, if that's even appropriate since I have bad news. We have yet another murder. This time, one of Chicago's finest. I have, on the phone, Police Commissioner Nie Rifkin. I also have, via satellite, sex crimes specialist Danny Davidovitch. Now, here's my first question, and I'm not makin' any suggestions here. Was the cop slash victim gay? - Ma'am, we really don't discuss that. - Yes or no? - Rumor has it. - Thank you. I swear, it's like pulling teeth. Commissioner, I think I'm getting closer to solving this case than the two of you are together with this wonderkid Frank Olive. (Commissioner chuckles) When I'm done, I will let you know so that you can get a promotion. - Frank! Did you fucking hear that? (eerie instrumental music) - Don't worry. I'm closer than you can imagine. - How close? - Very close.
