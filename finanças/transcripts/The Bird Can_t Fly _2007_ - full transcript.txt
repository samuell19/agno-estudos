Wash your hands. No personal items in the kitchen. And certainly not this! And go! Hello? Mrs Greenfield. It's for you. Yes? Stone? Stone, is that you? Here we are, lady. End of the line. - Don't you go all the way into town? - Not anymore. I could pay you. Uh, it's… - It's very urgent. Please. - Sorry, against the regulations. They check on my mileage. It's not on my route anymore. There you are. Here, take these with you. Save him the trip. Isn't that against regulations? Just go straight. And the weather's fine! That boy's impossible! I can't find him anywhere. So much work. Put it on him. Stop! Stop! Stop! Bring her back up. Hey! Be careful! Melody! Stone. You said you'd wait for me. It was hot. It was too long. I-I figured you wouldn't come back. Bring her back up. Somebody. Bring her back up! It's okay. - Stone! - It's okay. - Put her down. - It's okay! It's not okay, just put her down! Can you open it? Stone? I have to see her. No! Meet your grandson, Melody. A child? June had a child? With whom? What happened? The old barn… it collapsed. We were too late. The weather's changed since you left. No more rain… and more sandstorms. Where is everyone? The mine collapsed. A lot of guys go to town and don't come back. But there's one mine still going, out there in the desert. The guys found a huge one and now they're all hoping again. I've spread out a little bit. Be good! Be good! Be good! Miss Grain? Is that Miss Grain? Gone where God cannot reach. Why didn't June leave? Why didn't she get out? - Watch out! - Oh, it's a dud. He likes to spy on us. My house… June's house. What have you done? Lived here. Isn't there going to be a wake or… something? What's his name? River. River. How old is he? Ten or so. Or so? Never a word for eleven years. Why didn't she tell me? I'm her mother. It's clear he can't stay. He'll go with me. There's no chance for him here. Be good. Hello, River. That's a very big knife you have. Where did you get it? I'm sure your mum didn't let you play with knives. You better give it to me. I'm your granny. June's mother. From now on, I'm going to take care of you. No dinner until I get the knife! What a delicious soup, Grace. I seem to remember you liking soup, Melody, so I thought… It's hot. I just finished making it. Thank you. Where would I be without you, Grace?

Go home, Melody. We don't need you here. - I was chatting to Melody. - Chatting? Really? Well, I thought I'd go and make her feel more welcome and less alone. - And? - You know her. She moved my pot so it wouldn't dirty her table. She hasn't changed a bit. She's still got that air. She may have left Fairlands as a chef, but let's not forget she started as a maid. Hi, Melody. Let me help you with that. Be good. We have to build up our forces. Tomorrow we catch ostriches. I'm going to tame them. When they get eggs, you each get one. This means that we don't take the eggs to sell any more. Do you understand? Anyone found taking eggs will be punished. You must all look for rope. Bring all the rope you can find!

Just think how it feels for me too. You killed her! No, it was the sand on the roof - that made it come down, not me! - You promised her you'd fix it! I heard you, but you didn't do anything!

Melody seems to have done well. You'd be surprised the things June told me about Melody. Melody. Melody wants to take River. Take River? What do you mean? She's going to take him away? I think she wants what is best for the child. June wasn't always the perfect mother. Surely Scoop won't let him go. Melody! Speak of the de... I mean, what a pleasant surprise! What can I do for you? I'd like three bars of chocolate, a kilo of flour, 300 grams sugar, vanilla extract, baking powder, butter, unsalted, coco. What? What's the matter? So, what do you have? - Not the cherries! They're for the men. - The men. It's okay. I'll get the car running this afternoon. I'll go to town and stock up. All of it, Stone. May I please have it all? - Eggs? - No eggs. - As ever. - That's not for sale. Mm. It's first come first served, isn't that the rule? Do you think that'll cover it? Thank you. This isn't enough. We need more rope. - Captain, she's going to bake a cake! - A cake? - Is it your birthday? - No. Today is the day. We need a longer rope! What did you do with Mum's flowers! You've taken an egg. No, I bought it… for you, for your pie. It's too late now. It's cold. It's dead. You don't understand anything. You're a stupid woman! No, I do understand. I do. You can have the egg if you want it. This egg's no use now! You want to hatch one? We'll find you another. With this one I'll make you a delicious pie, or cake, or… whatever you like most. No, River. Please, please don't. Don't. Don't you remember how the men used to bring flowers back with them after the rain? Scoop used to bring the blue ones back for June. Melody… I can try to contact June for you if you want. - I can. - She can. What do you wish to know? You don't have to tell me. Just think it. She didn't suffer. She died instantly and it's no one's fault. No one. That's what she's trying to tell you. Stop. Where is the wood? I have the same problem. You've been wiping us off the walls. They started falling off. The man from the post truck gave them to me. I've been to the bloody post box! - Get over it, Scoop. - I'm a cripple! Anything for me? For Belle… from her daughter. I'll take it. Calm down. You'll manage? Thank you. She never wrote to me. You never wrote to her. I did. - I did write to her and send her money. - Well… I should know. We never got anything from you. Eh, Pretty, um… let's help Melody with her rubbish. I told you, no more eggs! - But, captain, it was before you said! - And you took my jacket! They gave it to me at the funeral. Look! Come on! Melody, River has to stay here with me. You can send us some money if you like, I'll send him to school. But he has to stay here with me. He's my son. Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Hold this. Hold it, and don't you dare eat it! - Can I eat it? - No! River! River! You made us fall! That was my ostrich! - Those birds can kill you. - I know! When I lived here, there was a man who was ripped apart by an ostrich, one kick, tore him open, guts all over the place. I had him! You let him go! You spoil everything! Let… go! She's like your mummy. It's a poison pie! - Poison pie! - Poison pie! Poison pie! Poison pie! Poison pie! Poison pie! Poison pie! Poison pie! Poison pie! She's gone mad! Completely insane. Leave her. June always used to feed them. Wind's changing. I don't like it. Your granny got the right idea, Captain. What we must do, we must get her to make another pie. Get her to make a bigger pie. Much, much bigger. No more pies! No pie? - You have to dig. - Yes. - A special grave, a very, very deep grave. - I dig! I dig a special grave. I dig! You won't be able to leave today. Melody, you can't leave right now. Why not? Wind is coming. Goodbye, Scoop. Stone won't take you. And if you walk, you'll die! Stone, will you take me to town, please? I was thinking of going this afternoon, but the wind has changed. Please. Please. Maybe we can beat her. Hop in. See whether this old girl wants to go. You're leaving? And the boy? What will happen with the boy? I can't help him. You should have tried to stay in touch with her. It doesn't cost much to write. - I did write, she didn't answer. - June never got any letters from you! Why didn't you answer the ones she wrote you? Personally I said, 'forget it', but June would never give up. Hop in! Melody! Where are you going? Stone! You must be crazy! It's a south one! She needs to go, Belle. You can leave if you want, but not with my husband to get stuck in a sand dune and choke to death when the storm comes down! You go, Melody, if you want to. You go. You walk! You got here on your two feet, didn't you? Melody. Melody! Don't go. Not now. And don't give up on River, Melody! - And don't give up on Scoop! - Don't give up on Scoop. Silver icing balls and crystallised flowers. What? Silver icing balls, and hundreds and thousands of crystallised flowers in all colours of the rainbow. One day he'll go seven tiers high. - What are you saying? - Saying? - His poem. - His poem? I look out the window and dream of the desert. I remember the pancakes you made for me. - Pancakes with chocolate and lemon. - Where? Where is this poem? - This is his poem? - His poem. - Are there more? - More? No more. I told you he wouldn't take you with him. There's a storm coming. So you're a poet? And so original. I suppose I paid for this… to play all those beautiful love songs on. Hey! Hey! - You ruined my guitar, you bitch! - You took my letters and my money! My wife's money! Did she know? Did she? You're playing the tough lady again? I know how to cut meat. Hey! River! River! River! Hey! She wrote to me! Where are those letters? Scoop! Melody! River! She is dead! Boys! Go inside now! We have to go home, Captain. We have to go home! River! River! "Mother… tomorrow is your grandson's birthday. I never realised my son would grow so fast. I look up and see him running around the house and I think one day I'll have to let him go." I have to find him. In case he's stuck somewhere. I'm coming with you! Mum… there is a ghost walking with a living person. River! River! River! River! Stay here until the storm is over! I'll find him! Here! It's okay! Daddy! River! River! River! Aren't you dead? Not yet. Ow! We're in the Paradise. Stone used to come here. Look. This is my locker. Whose locker is that? - June's. "Always iron cotton between 165 and 195 degrees, linen between 195 and 230 degrees. The iron must be thoroughly cleaned every Monday morning with vinegar." These are the things I taught your mother. What stupid things? River… River, we have to go. It's getting dangerous here. Come on. - River! - I'm coming! River! River! River! Are you all right? I've walked these stairs endlessly. There was just the two of us, nobody else to look after us. I was so happy to go. I packed both our suitcases. I thought… we were close, you know? I thought she… She loves you. But I was in her belly. She needed to hatch me. - Like you want to hatch ostriches? - Yes, to tame them. That's a noble aspiration. But… I'm sorry, Captain, the deep hole I had to dig for you. It was ready, but the wind destroyed it. I always work hard, you know I can work hard. I don't need it anymore. You can stop digging. There's a lot to sweep. Scoop! Daddy! Daddy's coming home today, sweetie. Perhaps he'll bring us the biggest diamond we've ever seen! Hm? - Is my dad here? - Here? Yes, here! Have you seen Scoop? Huh, Scoop? I haven't seen him yet. That's your brother's. Your father, he always shows up. He always shows up when the men arrive. Don't worry. He always does. Yah! He's in the graveyard. There is an egg! It's still warm! Put it back! Bury it again. We can't let it cool down. Stay here! Bury it more! I need help. Can you help me? Us? Please? What happened? It's not enough, it's not enough! I need more. We need more! More! Isn't she afraid? One… I think his name is One.
