- Hello, I'm Antoni Cimolino, artistic director of the Stratford Festival, and it's my pleasure to welcome you to this live viewing party. Tonight, we're showing the film of our 2010 production of "The Tempest," directed by Des McAnuff, and starring the incomparable, Christopher Plummer, as Prospero. It's the last play that Shakespeare wrote on his own, though, he did collaborate on a couple of other later ones. And in many ways, it's his culminating tribute to the art that made him wealthy in his lifetime and uniquely famous in ours. Prospero is the master magician at the heart of the play, and directs and stage manages his own drama of revenge and reconciliation. "My so potent art," he calls it at one point, and later renouncing that same art as, "This rough magic." There's some pretty awesome stage magic, though, to be seen in this production. So, see if you can figure out how some of it's done. Like "Romeo and Juliet," a much earlier play, "The Tempest" is about an older generation that has made a mess of things, and a brave new world of hope represented by the new generation. And maybe it's doubly hopeful that in this last great masterpiece of Shakespeare, he opted for a much happier ending. If you enjoy tonight's film, I hope you'll join Strat Fest at home to watch more films on our library, plus new series and digital events that we'll be rolling out all winter long. One of the events I'm most excited about is the international book launch of all the sonnets of Shakespeare, a groundbreaking new study by world-renowned Shakespeare scholars, Stanley Wells and Paul Edmondson. My conversation with them will be our viewing party on December 17th. For tonight, here's a tantalizing preview performance of one of Shakespeare's sonnets. (upbeat music) - Thus can my love excuse the slow offense of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed. From where thou art, why should I haste me thence? Till I return, of posting there is no need. Oh, what excuse will my poor beast then find, when swift extremity can seem but slow? Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind, in winged speed no motion shall I know. Then can no horse with my desire keep pace. Therefore desire of perfect love being made shall reign no dull flesh in his fiery race. But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade. Since from thee going he went willful slow, towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go. - Join Start Fest at home, to be part of the international book launch of all the sonnets of Shakespeare, and to be the first audience for much more content all winter long.

Then it's off to that enchanted island of marvels and magical creatures, where old enemies are about to be confronted, and young lovers are about to bring new hope into the world. Thank you for joining us. - All my life I have been mad, passionate for islands. I grew up in Senneville, Quebec on the Lake of Two Mountains. My mum's best lady friend owned a beautiful island just across from us. I spent most of my childhood on that island. I used to sneak over and walk around or I'd play tennis and I just would radiate at the wonder of an island. It was an escape and it spoke to you and we even had conversations. And then when I was old enough to read Shakespeare's Tempest, it all fell into place. The island was Prospero's imagination. - I think the most important thing about the island, about Prospero's island, which is really Caliban's island, is that the island is not just a literal place. The island is a mirror and it reflects back the things that the characters are saying for Antonio and Sebastian, it's desolate, it's a rather desperate place. For Gonzalo, it's Utopia. Our island is basically a magic circle. It's Prospero's magic circle. And it's a disk that sometimes spins and sometimes elevates. And it's actually very austere. The Island really comes to life, well, certainly in the characters in those marvelous performances, Julyana Soelistyo and Tim Stickney and Vickery and Dion Johnstone, this wonderful task, Trish Lindstrom. But I think mainly comes to life in the imaginations of the audience. It really comes to life in the eyes of the characters and that's the most important image a stage director can create. It's not the scenery, it's the actors are conjurers and it's what they see and hear and smell that really brings the play to life for the audience. - Blow till thou burst thy wind, if room enough! Good Boatswain, have care. Where's the Master? Play the men. - I pray now, keep below. - Where is the Master, Boatswain? - Do you not hear him? You mar our labor. Keep your cabins. You do assist the storm. (ocean wave sounds) - Nay, good, be patient. - When the sea is, hence. What cares these roarers for the name of king! To cabin! Silence! Trouble us not! - Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard. - Not that I love more dearly than myself. - During the Tempest, you don't need any research. The writing of Shakespeare and the rhythm of his verse are the most freeing things you can have on the stage. You must have the technique to be able to stretch the line as he wrote it and you have to obey his rhythms. And once you do, you're off, he's carried you with him. - The thing that's interesting about the Tempest is that it was written late in Shakespeare's career. It's probably his last solo play but the company spent a lot of time trying to move indoors to eventually the Blackfriars theater, away from the globe so that they could embrace certain elements of spectacle and magic. And obviously they could work in the winter months. There were all kinds of advantages. And around that time, as the 17th century started to unfold there was a movement toward the mask, the designer, Inigo Jones Robert Real's predecessor, they were interested in a sense new dimensions of stage magic. So the great thing is that Shakespeare is also not only a great dramatist, but a wonderful guide. There's the magic of the Island itself of Caliban and of Ariel and of the spirits. And then there's Prospero's magic, which is very much based on science. The important thing is not to layer in more spectacle than Shakespeare desires. There's an image where Chris seems to be sitting in mid air, with the staff he's sitting with mid irony actually lifts his feet just before he descends floating. And so there were gasps and those had everything to do with Greg. Greg Kramer was the magician that we worked with on the Tempest. And he made really a glorious contribution to the piece. He worked very, very closely with Chris and with the acting company and gave me many choices as we went through the text. And the thing about Greg is that he was an actor as well. So he truly understood the dynamics of the play and what was required. The opening of the film where Ariel descends from the heavens and picks up the magic book. I think works marvelously well in the film and was something that I was concerned about because of course, in the theater you see this little figure plummeting from above and it takes your breath away. And I was concerned that we try to create that, that same sort of surreal, energy. And I think we did manage to do that. (soft music) (thunder roars) - Father! Father! - So I think we were very true to the most important dynamics in the piece. And it's astonishing how it still applies. It's about power, it's of course, a love story on one level, but it's about power and betrayal and politics. And it reminds me so much of the times we're in, the treachery of Antonio and the ambition of Alonso, and it could be Ottawa, it could be Washington, sadly enough, on this very day. - I think you wouldn't go to Shakespeare to be comforted. You would go to him to be entertained and to forget your woes. This is what he would say, I think. He never does that in his place which is so extraordinary. He never has his characters be sorry for themselves. He won't allow it. And even Hamlet is quite sincere and wonderful when he says that simple line, the rest is silence. What could be a more simple and extraordinary phrase? It's more modern than anything we say today. - There was a wonderful moment in the Tempest. Ariel basically is talking about the torture of the Lords of Alonso and everything that Prospero's put them through. Ariel says, if you could behold them, they're so tortured that, you would feel this tender affection. And Prospero says, "Dust thou think so, spirit?" Ariel says, "Mine would, were I human." And there's a pause, a Christopher Plummer pause and he says, "And mine shall." And in that little moment, that pause, the entire story shifts and he's not sure what he's going to do with those Lords, those betrayers until that very moment. And it happens in that gap. - The King, his brother, and yours, abide, all three distracted. And the remainder mourning over them, brimful of sorrow and dismay. But chiefly him that you termed, sir, "The good old Lord Gonzalo." His tears run down his beard like winter's drops from eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works them that if you now beheld them your affections would become tender. - Dost I think so, spirit? - Mine would, sir, were I human. - And mine shall. Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling of their afflictions and shall not myself. One of their kind, we kindly moved than thou art? The rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance. - When we were planning that scene, I thought, well, I'll put Ariel close to him. And he said, "No, no, no, I think there needs to be some distance there." And so I put them both on the fourth stage, it's the simplest blocking you could ask one that states, they're both sitting on the four stage, maybe, 10, 15 feet apart. And when she says that, "Mine would, sir, were I human," he just cocks his head. And again, that's this explosion dramatically. And when I first saw him do it which came very much from Chris, I shed tears. I mean, I've thought of Chris for many years as the great actor of of not just as generation, but of our time. And I did get work with Amanda Plummer, Chris's daughter many years ago. She actually did Juliet for me. And so I kinda felt like I was at least a distant cousin when we started actually working together. This was absolutely your dream. And I still, to this day, when we meet, I'm always trying to get Chris to give me advice about just recently seen particular films and Eisenstein, I didn't know, the work of the British director Carol Reed and so on. And so it's been a joyous collaboration. It's also rare in life, we make, we make most of our friends when we're in school. It seems to me those are the friendships most. So to make a friend and I would have been in my late forties to make a close friend at that stage is truly a blessing. - Yeah, wonderful. Absolutely and all of. What's your name? - Ernie. (both laugh) - That's great. And he's such a passionate director, he knows about music, he knows about poetry and he knows about modern theater. He knows a lot with an over spill of rock thrown in every now and then to great success, of course, as we know. And I was amazed how versatile he is as a director. He can be as real today and as real back in the Elizabethan era as possible. - This was a great process of discovery in general. I think that the thing that's exciting about these captures of productions is that it is kind of a new art form. One is making a film, absolutely. But there's also a strong dimension where you're capturing an event. You're documenting an event. We had a terrific team, Barry Avrich, our illustrious producer, Sheila O'Brian as well as a whole assortment of other technicians and talented artisans. So I think I was pretty confident with the team but I've gotta say there's also a wonderful, I don't wanna say random, but there's a kind of a general approach to, when you have so many angles you don't have to make mammoth adjustments to the staging. The cameras were really keeping up with the staging. And when we chose positions, we had that very much in mind. We didn't want to ruin the performance for the people that were actually in the room. - So your audience themselves extremely well. That audience is so sort of informed and we were lucky to have them out there and they did not distract one little bit. - It is live theater and they're very much a part of the experience. So we tried to choose positions that weren't incredibly intrusive. - Did you include them in some of the room? The audience reaction, I remember, that was good. - You can't see them and it's occasional and generally they're somewhat faded in the background. - Yeah. - But it's great because I think it reminds the viewer that this is a live performance. - A live performance. - And it's a different art form than cinema. - In some cases, of course, it really belongs to the theater. And that's when I get a little uptight because I think we should honor the old fashioned thing of the 1800 people who paid their money and the style with which we play because of that - On a movie you're basically story boarding, you're doing your shot list, you're coming in with a plan, that's mainly focused on one camera. Maybe if you're Ridley Scott, you're shooting with four, but most of the time you're assembling actors, they're coming and going. You're putting costumes on for that particular scene. And you're filming in byte-sized chunks. Only Alfred Hitchcock got to shoot in order. And with this, it's a different thing. You've got nine cameras. You're basically getting as much coverage as you possibly can, collecting this raw material for editorial. The thing that's most similar is the editorial process. And I had a great post-production team on this. And so that's the part of it's that's most similar I think from making a film. The thing that's profoundly different from actually making a motion picture is that so much of the work has already been done. Directing is really about two things, mainly, it's about storytelling and performance. All of that work had already been accomplished. The piece was blocked, there were costumes, it was lit. And while one has to make adjustments for the camera with these extraordinary digital cameras, those adjustments are relatively minor. And ultimately it seems to me that you live and die based on the quality of the production. I think when seeing the films, I think you would feel that there was a truthful representation of the production. And so that was the thing that was most important to me. You can't see every transition of course, the way you can in the theater. So we would often follow the actors, or we would make those transitions work in a different way. And that you're not necessarily celebrating the spectacle in the same way. Nonetheless, I think just emotionally and intellectually the films are very true to the productions. And I had the benefit of working with just tremendous people. And in a sense that was an extension of the collaboration that we all enjoy in the theater. And perhaps this is simply, director ego but I had so much confidence because of George Bernard Shaw and William Shakespeare first and foremost, but because of of Christopher Plummer. So I did feel like this was something that was really worthwhile. - In a very different and rather vulgar way, you think it's your last job. (laughs) No revels now are ended, but then you say to yourself, down the line a little bit, it's, "Now my charms are all o'erthrown." I'm not going to over throw my charms, let me play other parts, it's not the end. 'Cause most people think that once you've played King of the year and prosper, that's it. There's no other great art. Well, wrong. I've just finished playing Tolstoy, Kaiser Wilhelm and J Paul Getty. I mean, now I'm going on forever. It's how old need you be to play Prospero? Well, he's not old. I mean, I felt suspended. It's beautiful because he's just as young when the curtain goes down as he is when the curtain goes up, it's an ageless part. Absolutely ageless. Fortunately, if you're true to yourself you could wear a suit or a bikini or whatever you want. And you'd still be believed if you are honest and true it doesn't matter, then what costume you wear. But the costume is on its own a very influential thing. And once you've put on the costume that you like, for instance let's use that wonderful cloak that Paul Tasmil designed for Prospero, full of leaves, green seaweed and all sorts of stuff. As a cloak, it was absolutely brilliant and lovely. Once you put that on it gives you an extra lift and it drives you forward. So it's very, very valuable, the right sort of costume. - At the end of the day it all has to be one thing, the visuals, the text, the music, there has to be a uniformity. The thing that I love about the theater is that I consider the whole stage, the canvas. The theater is an art form in itself beyond dramatic literature. And of course the festival stage is the perfect place to celebrate that. - Now my charms are all o'erthrown. And what strength I have is mine own, which is most faint. Now 'tis true, I must be here confined by you or sent to Naples. Let me not, since I have my dukedom got and pardoned the deceiver, dwell in this bare Island by your spell. But release me from my bands with the help of your good hands. Gentle breath of yours my sails must fill, or else my project fails, which was to please. Now I want spirits to enforce, art to enchant. And my ending is despair, unless I be relieved by prayer, which pierces so that it assaults mercy itself and frees all faults. As you from crimes would pardoned be. Let your indulgence set me free. Father! Father! Boatswain! Here, master. What cheers? Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely, or we run ourselves aground. Bestir, bestir. Hey, my hearts! Cheerly, cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! Yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough! Good Boatswain, have care. Where's the master? Play the men. I pray now, keep below. Where is the master, bos'n? Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your cabins - you do assist the storm. Nay, good, be patient. When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king? To Cabin. Silence! Trouble us not. Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard. None that I more dearly love than myself. You are a counsellor; if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more - use your authority. If you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap. Father! Father! Cheerly, good hearts! Out of our way, I say. I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is perfect gallows. But if he be not born to be hanged, our case is miserable. Down with the topmast! Lower, lower! Bring her to try with main-course. A plague upon this howling! They are louder than the weather or our office. Yet again! What do you here? Shall we give o'er and drown? Have you a mind to sink? A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog! Work you, then. Hang, cur, hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker! We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art. I'll warrant him from drowning; though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench. Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to sea again; lay her off. Father! All lost! To prayers, to prayers! All lost! What, must our mouths be cold? The King and Prince at prayers! Let's assist them, for our case is as theirs. I'm out of patience. We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards. This wide-chapp'd rascal- would thou mightst lie drowning. The washing of ten tides! He'll be hang'd yet. ♪ Mercy on us! 'Farewell, my wife and children!' 'We split, we split, we split!' Farewell my brother! Let's all sink with the king. Let's take leave of him. Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground. The wills above be done, but I would fain die a dry death. Father! Oh Father! If by your art, my dearest father, you have put the wild waters in this roar, allay them. The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek, dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered with those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel, who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her - Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock Against my very heart - Poor souls, they perish'd. Had I been any god of power, I would have sunk the sea within the earth or ere it should the good ship so have swallowed and the fraughting souls within her. Be collected! No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart there's no harm done. O, woe the day! No harm. I have done nothing but in care of thee, of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing from whence I am, nor that I am more better than Prospero, master of a full poor cell, And thy no greater father. More to know did never meddle with my thoughts. 'Tis time I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand, and pluck my magic garment from me. So, so, so, have comfort. The direful spectacle of the wreck, that touched the very virtue of compassion in thee, I have with such provision in mine art so safely ordered that there is no soul- No, not so much perdition as an hair betid to any creature in the vessel which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Wipe thou thine yes. So lie there, my art. ♪ You have often begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd and left me to a bootless inquisition, concluding 'Stay, not yet.' The hours now come; Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember a time before we came unto this cell? I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not out three years old. Certainly, sir, I can. 'Tis far off And rather like a dream than an assurance that my remembrance warrants. Had I not four or five women once that tended me? Thou hadst, and more, twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, thy father was the Duke of Milan, and A prince of power - Sir, are not you my father? Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and she said thou wast my daughter; And they father was Duke of Milan. And his only heir and princess no worse issued. O the heavens! What foul play had we, that we came from thence? Or blessed was't we did? Both, both, my girl. By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence, but blessedly holp hither. O, my heart bleeds to think of the trouble I have turn'd you to, which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther. My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio- I pray thee, mark me- that a brother should be so... Perfidious ! He whom next thyself of all the world I loved and to him put the manage of my state; as it was then through all the signories the first and Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed in dignity, and for the liberal arts without a parallel; those being all my study, the government I cast upon my brother and to my state grew stranger, being transported and rapt in secret studies. Oh! Thy false uncle- Dost thou attend me? Sir, most heedfully. Thy false uncle - Once perfected how to grant suits, how to deny them New created the offices that were mine set all heart i' the state to what tune pleased his ear. that now he was the ivy which had hid my princely trunk, and suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not. O, good sir, I do. I pray thee, mark me. I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind in my false brother awaked an evil nature, and my trust, like a good parent, did beget of him a falsehood in its contrary as great as my trust was; which had indeed, no limit, a confidence sans bound. He being thus being lorded, made such a sinner of his memory to credit his own lie, he did believe he was indeed the duke, dost thou hear? Your tale, sir, would cure deafness. Me, poor man, my library was dukedom large enough. Of temporal royalties he thinks me now incapable; conspires with King of Naples to give him annual tribute, to him homage, subject his coronet to his crown and bend the dukedom yet unbowed - alas, poor Milan! - To most ignoble stooping. O, the heavens! Mark his condition and th' event; then tell me if this might be a brother. I should sin to think but nobly of my grandmother: Good wombs have borne bad sons. Good wombs have borne bad sons. Now the condition. This King of Naples, being an enemy to me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit, which was that he, in lieu o' the premises should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan With all the honours on my brother: whereon, a treacherous army levied, one midnight fated to the purpose did Antonio open the gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness, the ministers for the purpose hurried thence me and thy crying self. Alack, for pity! I, not remembering how I cried out then, Will cry it o'er again - it is a hint that wrings mine eyes to't. Wherefore did they not that hour destroy us? Well demanded, wench: They durst not, so dear the love my people bore me, in few, they hurried us aboard a bark, bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared a rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg'd, nor tackle, sail, nor mast - the very rats instinctively have quit it. There they hoist us, to cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh to the winds whose pity, sighing back again, did us but loving wrong. Alack, what trouble Was I then to you! O, oh... a cherubim thou wast that did preserve me. When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt, thou didst smile, infused with a fortitude from heaven. How came we ashore? By Providence divine. Some food we had and some fresh water that a noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, out of his charity did give us, with rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries, Which since have steaded much; and of his gentleness, knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me from mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom. I might but ever see that man! Ah. Now I arise. Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow. Here in this island we arrived, and here have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit than other princes can who have more time for vainer hours and tutors not so careful. Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir, for still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason for raising this sea-storm? Ah. Know thus far forth. By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune, now my dear lady, hath mine enemies brought to this shore; and by my prescience I find my zenith doth depend upon a most auspicious star, whose influence If now I court not but omit, my fortunes will ever after droop. Here cease more questions: Thou art inclined to sleep. ♪ 'tis a good dulness, give it way: ♪ I know thou canst not choose. Come away, servant, Come! ♪ I am ready now. Approach, my Ariel, come. All hail, great master! Grave sir, hail! I come to answer thy best pleasure, be't to fly, to swim, to dive into the fire, to ride on the curled clouds, to thy strong bidding task Ariel and all her quality. Spirit! Has thou perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee? To every article. I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak, now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin, I flamed amazement. Sometime I'd divide and burn in many places- on the topmast, the yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly, then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors of the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary and sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble, Yea, his dread trident shake. My brave spirit! Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil would not infect his reason? Not a soul but felt a fever of the mad, and played some tricks of desperation. All but mariners plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel, Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand, With hair up-staring,-- then like reeds, not hair, -- Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty and all the devils are here.' That's my spirit! But was not this nigh shore? Close by, my master. But are they, Ariel, safe? Not a hair perished. On their sustaining garments not a blemish, but fresher than before: and as thou bad'st me, in troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle. The king's son have I landed by himself; Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs in an odd angle of the isle and sitting, his arms in this sad knot. Of the king's ship, the mariners, say how thou hast disposed and all the rest o' the fleet. Safely in harbour is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew from the still-vex'd Bermudas, there she's hid: The mariners all under hatches stowed, who, with a charm joined to their suffer'd labour, I have left asleep; as for the rest o'th fleet which I dispersed, they all have met again, and are upon the Mediterranean flote, bound sadly home for Naples, supposing that they saw the king's ship wrecked, and his great person perish. Ariel, thy charge exactly is perform'd: but there's more work. Aye! Aye? What is the time o'th day? Past the mid season. At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now must by us both be spent most preciously. Is there more toil? Uh-huh. Since thou dost give me pains, let me remember thee what thou hast promised, which is not yet performed me. How now? Moody? What is't thou canst demand? My liberty. Before the time be out? No more! I prithee, remember I have done thee worthy service; told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served without or grudge or grumblings. Thou didst promise to bate me a full year. Dost thou forget from what a torment I did free thee? - No. Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze of the salt deep, to run upon the sharp wind of the north, to do me business in the veins o'th earth when it is baked with frost. I do not, sir. Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot the foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy was grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her? No, sir. Thou hast. Where was she born? Speak; tell me. Sir, in Algiers. O, was she so? I must once in a month recount what thou hast been, which thou forget'st. O-la-la-la- la-la-la. This damn'd witch Sycorax, for mischiefs manifold and sorceries too terrible to enter human hearing, from Algiers. Thou know'st was banished - for one thing she did they would not take her life. Is not this true? Ay, sir. Ay, sir. This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child and here was left by th' sailors. Thou, my slave, as thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant, and for thou wast a spirit too delicate to act her earthy and abhorred commands, she did confine thee, into a cloven pine, within which rift, imprisoned thou didst painfully remain a dozen years within which space she died and left thee there! Oh-ho! Thou best know'st what torment I did find thee in; Thy groans did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts of ever angry bears - it was a torment to lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax could not again undo: it was mine art, when I arrived and heard thee, that made gape the pine and let thee out. I thank thee, master. I thank thee, master. If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak and peg thee in his knotty entrails till thou hast howled away twelve winters. Pardon, master. I will be correspondent to command and do my spiriting gently. Do so, and after two days I will discharge thee. That's my noble master! What shall I do? Say what: what shall I do? Go make thyself like a nymph o'th sea: be subject to no sight but thine and mine, invisible to every eyeball else. Go take this shape and hither come in't: Go! Hence! Ah-ah-ah-ah! With diligence! Awake, dear heart, awake! Awake. Thou hast slept well. The strangest of your story put heaviness in me. Shake it off. Come! We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never yields us kind answer. 'Tis a villain, sir, I do not love to look on. Well he does make our fire. and fetches us in wood and serves in offices that profit us. As tis, we cannot miss him. ♪ What, ho, slave! Caliban! Thou earth, thou! Speak! There's wood enough within. Come forth. There's other business for thee. My quaint Ariel, A word, a word, in thine ear. My lord, it shall be done. Come! Tortoise, poisonous slave, got by the devil himself upon thy wicked dam, come forth, I say! As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd with raven's feather from unwholesome fen drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye and blister you all o'er! For this, be sure, tonight thou shall be pinched as thick as honeycomb, each pine more stinging than bees that made 'em. I must eat my dinner. This island's mine by Sycorax my mother, which thou takest from me. When thou camest first, Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me Water with berries in't, and teach me how to name the bigger light, and how the less, That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle, The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile: Cursed be I that did so! All the charms Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you! For I am all the subjects that you have, Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me The rest o' the island. Thou most lying slave, Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee, Filth as thou art, with humane care, and lodged thee In mine own cell, where thou didst seek to violate The honour of my child. O ho, O ho! would't had been done! Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else this isle with Calibans. Abhorred slave, Which any print of goodness wilt not take, Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee, Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage, Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes With words that made them known. But thy vile race, Though thou didst learn, had that in't which good natures Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou Deservedly confined into this rock, Who hadst deserved more than a prison. You taught me language; and my profit on't, is I know how to curse. The red plague rid you For learning me your language! Hag-seed, hence! Fetch us in fuel, be quick, thou'rt best to answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice? I'll rack thee with old cramps, fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar that beasts shall tremble at thy din. No, pray thee. ♪ I must obey.

Vouchsafe my prayer May know if you remain upon this island; And that you will some good instruction give How I may bear me here: my prime request, Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder! If you be maid or no? No wonder, sir; But certainly a maid. My language! Heavens! I am the best of them that speak this speech, Were I but where 'tis spoken. How? The best? What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee? A single thing, as I am now, that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me. And that he does, I weep. Myself am Naples. Ah. who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld the King my father wrecked. Alack, for mercy! At the first sight They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel, I'll set thee free for this. One word, sir; I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word. Why speaks my father so ungently? This Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first that e'er I sigh'd for. Pity move my father to be inclined my way! O, if a virgin, And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you the queen of Naples. They are both in either's powers; but this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning Make the prize light. One word, good sir! thou dost here usurp The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself upon this island as a spy, to win it from me, the lord on't. No, as I am a man. There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple: If the ill spirit have so fair a house, good things will strive to dwell with't. Come Follow me. Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come, I'll manacle thy neck and feet together: Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow. No; I will resist such entertainment till mine enemy has more power. O dear father, Make not too rash a trial of him, for He's gentle and not fearful. What, I say - My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor; Which makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience Is so possess'd with guilt: come from this posture, For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop. Beseech you, father. Hang not on my garments. Sir, have pity; I'll be his surety. Silence! What! An advocate for an imposter! Hush! Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch! Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he, Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench! To the most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels. My affections Are then most humble; I have no ambition To see a goodlier man. Come on; obey: Thy nerves are in their infancy again And have no vigour in them. So they are; My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up. My father's loss, the weakness which I feel, The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats, To whom I am subdued, are but light to me, Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth Let liberty make use of; space enough Have I in such a prison. Come on. Follow me! Be of comfort; My father's of a better nature, sir, Than he appears by speech: Oh come on! Speak not for him. It works. Thou shalt be as free as mountain winds. ♪ Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause, So have we all, of joy; for our escape Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe Is common; every day some sailor's wife, The masters of some merchant and the merchant Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle, I mean our preservation, few in millions Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh our sorrow with our comfort. Prithee, peace. He receives comfort like cold porridge. Look Gonzalo's winding up the watch of his wit; by and by it will strike. Sir,-- One.One. When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd, Comes to the entertainer- A dollar. Dolour comes to him, indeed: you have spoken truer than you purposed. You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should. Therefore, my lord,-- Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue! I prithee, spare. Well, I have done: but yet,-- He will be talking. Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to crow? The old cock. The cockerel. Done. Though this island seem to be desert,-- Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid. Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,-- Yet,--Yet, -- He could not miss't. It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate temperance. Temperance was a delicate wench. Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered. The air breathes upon us here most sweetly. As if it had lungs and rotten ones. Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen. Here is everything advantageous to life. True; save means to live. Of that there's none, or little. How lush and lusty the grass looks! How green! The ground indeed is tawny. With an eye of green in't. He misses not much. No; he doth but mistake the truth totally. Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the king's fair daughter, Claribel, to the King of Tunis. 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return. Tunis was never before graced with such a paragon to their queen. Not since widow Dido's time. 'Widow Dido' said you? She was of Carthage, not of Tunis. This Tunis, sir, was Carthage. Carthage? I assure you, Carthage. What impossible matter will he make easy next? Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now queen. And the rarest that e'er came there. Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I mean, in a sort. That sort was well fished for. When I wore it at your daughter's marriage? You cram these words into mine ears against the stomach of my sense. Would I had never married my daughter there, for coming thence, my son is lost and, in my rate, she too, Who is so far from Italy removed I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish Hath made his meal on thee? Sir, your son may live: I saw him beat the surges under him, And ride upon their backs; he trod the water, Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head 'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd, As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt He came alive to land. ♪ No, no, he's gone. Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss, That would not bless our Europe with your daughter, But rather lose her to an African; Where she at least is banish'd from your eye, Who hath cause to wet the grief on't. Prithee, peace. You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise By all of us, and the fair soul herself Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your son, I fear, forever. Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business' making Than we bring men to comfort them: The fault's your own. So is the dear'st o' the loss. My lord Sebastian, The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in: you rub the sore, When you should bring the plaster. Very well. And most surgeonly. It is foul weather in us all, good sir, When you are cloudy. Foul weather? Very foul. Had I plantation of this isle, my lord, -- He'ld sow't with nettle-seed. Or docks, or mallows. And were the king on't, what would I do? 'Scape being drunk for want of wine. I' the commonwealth I would by contraries Execute all things; for no kind of traffic Would I admit; no name of magistrate; Letters should not be known; riches, poverty, And use of service, none; contract, inheritance, Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none; No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil; No occupation; all men idle, all; And women too, but innocent and pure; No sovereignty;-- Yet he would be king on't. The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning. All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony, Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine, Would I not have; but nature should bring forth of its own kind, all foison, all abundance, To feed my innocent people. No marrying 'mong his subjects? None, man; all idle: whores and knaves. I would with such perfection govern, sir, To excel the golden age. Save his majesty! Long live Gonzalo! And,--do you mark me, sir? Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me. I do well believe your highness; and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing. 'Twas you we laughed at. Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you: so you may continue and laugh at nothing still. What a blow was there given! An it had not fallen flat-long. You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue in it five weeks without changing. Nay, good my lord, be not angry. No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discretion so weakly. Will you... laugh me asleep, for I am very... ♪ heavy? Go sleep, and hear us. What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: ♪ I find they are inclined to do so. Please you, sir, Do not omit the heavy offer of it: It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth, It is a comforter. We two, my lord, will guard your person while you take your rest, And watch your safety. Thank you. Wondrous heavy. What a strange drowsiness possesses them! It is the quality o' the climate. Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not Myself disposed to sleep. Nor I; my spirits are nimble. They fell together all, as by consent; They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might, Worthy Sebastian? O, what might? No more:-- And yet methinks I see it in thy face, What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and my strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head. What, art thou waking? Do you not hear me speak? I do; and surely It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say? This is a strange repose, to be asleep With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving, And yet so fast asleep. Noble Sebastian, Thou let'st thy fortune sleep- die, rather; wink'st Whiles thou art waking. Thou dost snore distinctly; There's meaning in thy snores. I am more serious than my custom: you Must be so too, if heed me; which to do Trebles thee o'er. Well, I am standing water. I'll teach you how to flow. Prithee, say on: The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim A matter from thee, and a birth indeed Which throes thee much to yield. Thus, sir: Although this lord of weak remembrance, this, Who shall be of as little memory When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuaded,-- the King his son's alive, 'Tis as impossible that he's undrowned as he that sleeps here swims. I have no hope That he's undrown'd. O, out of that 'no hope' What great hope have you! No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond, Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drown'd? He's gone. Then, tell me, Who's the next heir of Naples? His sister, Claribel. She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples Can have no note, unless the sun were post- The man i' the moon's too slow- till new-born chins Be rough and razorable; she that-from whom we all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again, And by that destiny to perform an act whereof what's past is prologue, what to come In yours and my discharge. What stuff is this! How say you? 'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis; So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions There is some space. A space whose every cubit Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis, And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate As amply and unnecessarily As this Gonzalo; O, that you bore The mind that I do! what a sleep were this For your advancement! Do you understand me? Methinks I do. And how does your content Tender your own good fortune? I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero. True: And look how well my garments sit upon me; Much feater than before: my brother's servants Were then my fellows; now they are my men. But, for your conscience? Ay, sir; where lies that? I feel not This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences, That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother, No better than the earth he lies upon, If he were that which now he's like, that's dead; Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it, Can put to bed forever; whiles you, doing thus, To the perpetual wink might put This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who Should not upbraid our course. For the rest, They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk; They'll tell the clock to any business We say befits the hour. Thy case, dear friend, Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan, I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest; And I the king shall love thee. Draw together; ♪ And when I rear my hand, do you the like, To fall it on Gonzalo. O, but one word.

O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear, To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions. Heard you this, Gonzalo? Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming, And that a strange one too, which did awake me: I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd, I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise, That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard, Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons. ♪ Lead off this ground; and let's make further search For my poor son. Heavens keep him from these beasts! For he is, sure, i' the island. Lead away. Prospero my lord shall know what I have done: So, king, go safely on to seek thy son. All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch, Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i' the mire, Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but For every trifle are they set upon me; Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I All wound with adders who with cloven tongues Do hiss me into madness. Ow! Lo, no lo - Here comes another spirit of his, and to torment me For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat; Perchance he will not mind me. Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off any weather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we here? a man... or a fish? dead or alive? A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; A strange fish. Were I in England now, as once I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver: there would this monster make a man; any strange beast there makes a man: when they will not give a pence to relieve a lame beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like arms! He's warm! O'my troth I do now let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt. Alas, the storm is come again! My best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows.

Four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as ever went on... four legs cannot make him give ground; and it shall be said so again while Stephano breathes at's nostrils. The spirit torments me; Oh! This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Well how the devil should he learn our language? I will give him some relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a present fit for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.

Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that which will give language to you, cat: open your mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you. Ay, and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend: open your chaps again. I should know that voice: it should be- but he is drowned; and these are devils: O defend me! Four legs and two voices: it's a most delicate monster! His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Come on. There you go. Amen! I will pour some in thy other mouth. Stephano! Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy!

If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee by... the rounder legs: if any be Trinculo's legs, these be they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How camest thou to be the turd of this moon-calf? Can he vent Trinculos? I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art not drowned. Is the storm overblown?

Ay, Out o' the moon, I do assurethee: I was the man i' the moon when time was. I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee: My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.

This my mean task would be as heavy to me as odious, but the mistress which I serve quickens what's dead And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed, And he's composed of harshness. I must remove Some thousands of these logs and pile them up, upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness Had never like executor. I forget: But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours, Most busy lest, when I do it. Alas, now, pray you, Work not so hard: I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile! Pray, set it down and rest you: My father Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself; He's safe for these three hours. O most dear mistress, The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do. If you'll sit down, I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that; I'll carry it to the pile. No, precious creature; I had rather crack my sinews, break my back, Than you should such dishonour undergo, While I sit lazy by. It would become me As well as it does you: and I should do it With much more ease; for my good will is to it, And yours it is against. Poor worm, thou art infected! You look wearily. No, noble mistress; 'tis fresh morning with me When you are by at night. I do beseech you- Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers- What is your name? Miranda. -O my father, I have broke your hest to say so! Admired Miranda! Indeed the top of admiration! Worth what's dearest to the world! Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard and many a time the harmony of their tongues hath into bondage Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues Have I liked several women; never any With so full soul, but some defect in her Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed And put it to the foil: but you, O you, So perfect and so peerless, are created Of every creature's best! I do not know One of my sex; no woman's face remember, Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen More that I may call men than you, good friend, And my dear father: how features are abroad, I am skilless of; but, by my modesty, The jewel in my dower, I would not wish any companion in the world but you, Nor can imagination form a shape, Besides yourself, to like of. But what I prattle Something too wildly and my father's precepts I therein do forget. Hear my soul speak: The very instant that I saw you, did my heart fly to your service; there resides, To make me slave to it; and for your sake Am I this patient log-man. Do you love me? O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound And crown what I profess with kind event If I speak true! if hollowly, invert what best is boded me to mischief! I Beyond all limit of what else i' the world Do love, prize, honour you. I am a fool to weep at what I am glad of. Fair encounter Of two most rare affections!

Drink, drink when I bid thee, servant monster. O thy eyes are almost set in thy head. Where should they be set else? he were a brave monster indeed, if they were set in his tail. My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack: for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my standard. Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard. We'll not run, Monsieur Monster. Nor walk neither; but you'll lie like dogs and say nothing neither. Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a good moon-calf. How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe. I'll not serve him; he's not valiant. Thou liest! I am in case to justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou, was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster? Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord? 'Lord' quoth he! A most ignorant monster! Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee. Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you prove a mutineer,-- the next tree! The poor monster is my subject. He shall not suffer indignity. I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee? Marry, will I kneel and repeat it; I will stand, and so shall Trinculo. As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island. Thou liest. Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would my valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie. Trinculo, trouble him in's tale one more and by this hand, I shall supplant some of your teeth. Why, I said nothing. Mum, then, and no more. Proceed. I say, by sorcery he got this isle; From me he got it. if thy greatness will Revenge it on him, -- for I know thou darest, But this thing dare not,-- That's most certain. Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee. How now shall this be compassed? Canst thou bring me to the party? Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep, Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead. Thou liest; What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch! I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows And take his bottle from him: Ah! when that's gone he shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him Where the quick freshes are. Trinculo, run into no furtherdanger: interrupt the monster one word further, and by this hand, I shall turn my mercy out o' doors and I'll make a stock-fish of thee. Why, what did I? I did nothing. Didst thou not say he lied? Thou liest. Do I so? Take thou that. Ah! And that. As you like this, give me the lie another time. I did not give the lie. Out o' your wits and hearing too? Ah! A pox o' your bottle! this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil take your fingers! Ah! Now then, forward with your tale. I Prithee, stand farther off. Beat him enough: after a little time I'll beat him too. Stand farther. Proceed. Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him, I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him, Having first seized his books, or with a log Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake, Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember first to possess his books; for without them He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not One spirit to command: they all do hate him As rootedly as I. Burn but his books. And that most deeply to consider is the beauty of his daughter He himself Calls her a nonpareil: I never knew a woman, But only Sycorax my dam and she; But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As great'st does least. Is it so brave a lass? Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant. And bring thee forth brave brood. Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I shall be king and queen- save our graces! -- and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo? Excellent. Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but, while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head. Within this half hour will he be asleep: Wilt thou destroy him then? Ay, on mine honour. This will I tell my master. Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure: Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch You taught me but while-ere? At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason.

He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us! Art thou afeard? No, monster, not I. Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not. Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices That if I then had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming, The clouds methought would open and show riches Ready to drop upon me that when I waked, I cried to dream again. ♪ This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing.

Let me not, Since I have my dukedom got And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell in this bare island by your spell; But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands: Gentle breath of yours my sails Must fill, or else my project fails, Which was to please. Now I want Spirits to enforce, art to enchant, And my ending is despair, Unless I be relieved by prayer, Which pierces so that it assaults Mercy itself and frees all faults. As you from crimes would pardon'd be, Let your indulgence set me free. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
