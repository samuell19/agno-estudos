"Mirror, mirror on the wall..." said Yona to herself. Take a drink first. -Thanks. "Aviva Cohen" What is this? I don't understand. Believe me, Aviva, I did it all at the right rate. But how did it come to $1500? Your daughter needed four crowns. Too bad she didn't get your genes. -But why didn't you tell me? I told Moni. He said to do whatever needs to be done. I've only got $250 for now. -Hold on a second... Aviva, l've known you since you were this big... It's only money. We can work something out. We don't have that kind of money now, doctor. -For free, I meant. You just have to let me look at you sometimes. Look at what? I'll do the whole treatment for free. Just to look. It?s no big deal. You'll sit here, and if you get hot you'll take off your shirt... that's all. I don't understand, doctor. Think about it. It'll be between the two of us. Aviva? Why are you offering this? -To help you. Let's go. -Aviva? What's wrong with her? What don't you understand? He wants to nail you. -Stop it. You're so thick sometimes I want to kill you. "To look at you?" What is he, a painter? Horny bastard. He took a look at your cleavage and wanted to nail you with that old prick of his that you probably need a magnifying glass to see. Aviva, don't sink into it. Why don't you say yes? -Oh please... Why not? The minute you get undressed, he'll have a stroke and leave you all his money. Come on, dummy. I bet he can't even get it up. He wasn't embarrassed? Maybe if he asked me to strip for him... but a famous writer like you? -Stop saying that. -Why? Because I'm not a writer yet and you're stressing me out. That's the way it is, Aviva. What are you so happy about today? What, it's late? How long? -Two days. Shhh, we're not talking about it. Did you get tested? -Not yet, and we're not talking about it! You know what you can do with Zaharir the queer? -What? Write a story about it. -Fine. Listen to your sister. Write a story about him. "lf you sew three fairytale dresses for me the wedding dress department will be yours," said the workshop manager to Yona. And Yona smiled at him, despite her toothache, because she was grateful for the chance he gave her. She felt that finally, her spring was coming. "Three dresses in two days is a lot of work, " said Yona to herself. "l must eat and get strong. "I'll make myself fish in lemon." What about these fish? -Dump them. Ben-Ami will yell at me again for not making patties out of them. Dump them before I choke! Excited, Yona reached the market. But the vendor handed her such a smelly fish, she nearly choked. She wanted to yell at him: "What do you take me for, giving me a rotten fish?" But her mouth was numb and swollen, because of... the filthy injection the old dentist gave her before extracting her wisdom teeth. "What did you say?" asked the vendor. But Yona couldn't utter a word. "Mirror, mirror - Fish in lemon" Bye, baby. "l have to finish these dresses," said Yona to herself, "or the manager will regret everything." With fiery hands, she held the white fabric, but then the scissors slid, tearing the cloth, and cutting her hand. Her blood stained the whiteness and from her numb mouth a loud cry emerged. Aviva! Why did you turn the phone off? l've been calling you for hours. Why? -It's your mother again. Okay, thanks, I'll run over there. And tell Anita to return my vacuum cleaner before I get mad. Okay. Moni. C'mon, Moni... I have to run over to my mom's. -Again? And you have to go sign for unemployment. Don't be late today. And wake up Alon before you leave. -I'm up. Smoking so early? You barely opened your eyes. I only need to open my mouth to smoke a cigarette. At least brush your teeth. Moni... -You are my love. It is only you I dream about at night. Wait, what about the professor? You'll be late. -Don't worry. Yes? Relax, Mercedes, she won't jump. I?m coming! Calm her down, she's hysterical. So give her a little push, what's the problem? Good morning. -Good morning and a half. Going to Tel Aviv to see him again? lf Grandma calms down, why? That snob doesn't give a damn about you. You'd be surprised. -Surprised and a half. l've waiting for her to throw me down a shirt for ten minutes. -Why don't you go up? People are waiting for me to drive them to Beer Sheva. Aviva, where to? -Mom's. -Now? You're nuts! What can I do? She's out on the ledge. -What about my shirt? No way I?m canceling the lesson with Oded. -Anita! You nag! I?m not canceling even if she jumps! Pick me up from her house, I'll be ready. I'll kill you if you're not. Both of you. By cab! Not going! I want to smack you. You sent me here again? Finally! Aviva, you can't keep calling me over here every Monday and Thursday. Aviva, mon amour! Don't worry, Morris, I?m going up. She locked the door. Won't give us a moment's peace. I?m going up, Mercedes. You can go, Morris. Aviva, don't listen to Mercedes' nasty gossip. Violet, jump so we'll be rid of you and all your noise. Shut your trap or I'll jump and bury you along with me. I missed you and you turned off your phone, why? Where's Dad? -In the bathroom, out of the way. You've gone too far, Mom. Shame on you, Violet, the way you act. All day he cuts out recipes from the paper and asks me to cook. What am l, his restaurant? He's won't let me breathe. Why don't you take your pills? That's why you can't breathe. You think I don't know they're giving me saccharine? Why are you all dressed up? You're going to him again. You're having an affair! Yeah, I?m running off to Vegas with him. What affair? He helps me with my stories. And who will help me when you become famous? Your sister who gives me a vase that I got her 5 years ago? Violet, after everything l've done for you, you want to jump on me and kill me? Look at her, wailing like a banshee. But I love you, even though you're Moroccan. And what are you? Swiss? Want one? Maybe you need it too. One more word and I?m going. Go, you and your magazine hairdo. You're as stubborn as a mule. The bus won't wait for you. I?m just making her some soup. -I have soup. I'll tell her you made it, okay? Just go already. "Magazine hairdo" Well? -What can I do? She just fell asleep. Hello. I see your daughter came to visit you, so maybe you can tell her to take her vase out of here. Take it, it's over there. -I?m not talking to you. No, ma'am. I?m the one who's not talking to you. Then shut up if you're not talking. Don't talk to me like that. I?m not your mother anymore and you're not my daughter. Mom, go back to bed before I really get mad. It's always "Go to bed..." You'd think there was a casino in there. Don't forget he's also originally from Tiberias, so don't be shy. I?m not. What then? -I don't understand what he says. He talks about an "inner voice". I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with that. Ask him, he'll explain it. It?s no use. Maybe I?m just not cut out for this. You know, you're getting to me. l've been hearing that for the past 20 years, but you've written enough to fill a library. I found Oded for you, he works so hard for nothing, so say thank you and shut up. That's your third sandwich today. So what, I?m hungry. Shhh, we're not talking about it. Put some lipstick on, so you don't scare him. Sure you won't come up with me? -Sure and a half. Go. "My fever made my head swell up like a melon," said Yona to herself. "l hope he doesn't get scared and throw me out the door." How are things in Tiberias? Still eating fish? Whatever there is. I love the fish in Tiberias. You should come, we'll make you some. I will, I will. Next time I visit my aunt, I'll come for some fish. Did you do something different? Your hair? No... It?s been 20 years since I left the city and the weird thing is that all my dreams still take place there, in Tiberias. What's there to dream about? Don't say that. Tiberias is beautiful. Yeah, makes Miss Universe look like a dog. You're a funny woman, Aviva. Why are your stories so tragic? It?s my "inner voice". -Making fun of me, huh? No, of myself. I read one of your stories yesterday, it cracked me up. The woman who builds a slide from her window to the street. Because the stairwell smells of her neighbors' cooking. Too bad she falls off at the end. How did you read that? Did I give that one to you? It was here. With all your other material. Anita sent it to you. -Really? Not you? No. Does it really matter? I?m not sure I want you to read it. -Why? Because it's old. I haven't gone over it. Do you want my help or not? -Of course... Then what the hell is this nonsense? You're hiding stuff from me? What do I care who sent it? We agreed I'd read everything, right? Like I said, your writing is great, but there are lots of problems. No one will publish this. They'll say it's childish and throw you out the door, along with all... Leave it. I don't understand you. Sometimes I think your sister wants this more than you. I'm really investing a lot in this and not asking anything in return. I know. -Then you have to work too! No wonder you're stuck with the corrections. Take some time off, go away and work on it. Let's begin. Why did you send him the stories without telling me? He asked me to. -Why didn't you tell me? Just leave me alone, Aviva. I can't deal with you right now. What's your problem? Nothing. I?m sensitive and you're yelling at me. Why, what happened? Nothing new. Got my period. Like an idiot I didn't bring any tampons and by the time I noticed I had to buy new pants because everything was dirty. I stuffed my face for nothing. Enough with that sad face, I wanna go home. What about security? Lot of places need guards nowadays. That's only for people who did the army. Moni didn't. I?m sorry, Aviva. I really don't like this. We're like family. You said two months, it's already been six. What can I do, Moni? Look where I'm coming from. You said two, it's been six. -Okay, it's not that I... You told me two, it's been six! -Moni. Don't "Moni" me. He said two and it's been six! Now he says "security". He's the one who got me out of the army so I could work for him, now he's saying "security"?! Wait, I'll calm him down. I don't want you leaving like this. Moni, what are you doing? Did you pay me for these signs? I made those signs as a favor. Now I want them back. What are you, a baby? -"Security", he tells me. l've been working here since I was 17... Now he comes and tells me "Security". Back off! One more step and turn your face into a sign. -Moni. -What?! Tells me that times are tough, then hires workers from Romania. Ask them to make new signs in Romanian. -They're not from Romania Listen to him. He argues with me, he's teaching me geography. Just wait, I spoke to Moussa. He prepared a feast for you. You're really something. I missed you. Yeah, right, Avi. Go on, answer. Hello? Yeah. No, we're in Tiberias, shooting for a magazine... Hi. -How's it going? Hello? -Are you following me? -Huh? Bullshit, Aryeh, I saw you standing there like a lighthouse. What are you talking about?! I?m in the cab. lf you wanna see what they're doing, come here next to me, but don't embarrass me with your psycho binoculars. Hello? I can't hear you... I?m hanging up. What's with you? Have you lost it? He deserves it. You expect him to give you your job back now? What's your problem now? -I?m worried about you. -Oh yeah? Or are you afraid people'll say the famous writer is living with a an embarrassing psycho? Where did that come from? Where to? -To look for a job. Tell me the truth, is she seeing someone? What are you talking about? -Who is this Avi? An boyfriend from when she was in the army? Yes. So what exactly is she doing with him? He called yesterday to ask for her help with a TV item on Tiberias. Oh yeah? Who does she think she is, Britney Spears? You're following her again? Aryeh... Do me a favor, Aviva. Convince her we should move back to our apartment in Holon. Leave me out of it. -I've been begging her for a year. The doctors are better there, the cab will do better. What does she have here besides you? She doesn't work, your mother gives her hell, she takes it all out on me, and in the end she hangs around like a bimbo with that Avi. I'm asking you, Aviva, please talk to her. Our Lord of skies and seas, He's the one to bring us peace... Aviva. -What? Tell Alon to come and play some music. -Okay. Tell him not to be a jerk. -Okay. Aviva. -What?! Aviva... The spring, "Aviv", as clear as wine And the smell of pine... "SAT Study Guide" Hi. Did you eat? Were you at the garage? -Yes. Don't worry, Ofek, it'll be okay. Hey, Oshrat, you're early. What's my notebook doing here? Did you read it? -No. You sure? -Chill, I didn't read it. I wonder. Are you afraid I'll see what you write about me? I don't write about you. Is that a new book? Did you buy it? A friend from the army gave it to me. Don't worry, I didn't buy or read or do anything. What did I say? Hello? Go over to the big window in the salon for a second. Why? -'Cuz I told you to. Isn't he gorgeous? Why did you bring them? -I promised the neighbors. Now come down for an interview. -Are you nuts? Tell them how lousy the situation is. -Anita. -Hold on. Come on! I'll say that your book is about to be published. Don't you dare! I don't want to. Aviva! -Anita! Dummy... -Anita, we need you. -Coming. Aloni, why don't you go downstairs? All your friends are having fun. -Good for them. I saw Eleanor too. -Good for you too. Aren't you seeing each other anymore? Get dressed. Let's go to the movies. Don't feel like it. Suit yourself. Oshrati, how long are you on leave? Am I in your way? -Of course not. I just want to get organized. Because if I?m in your way, just say so. Feel free. What's your problem? Are you going to tell me what's bothering you or are you just going to keep dropping hints? -I need money. I'm out of contact solution and my eyes burn. Do you get it? Or do I need to get the Minister of Health to explain? What about your army salary? I haven't paid Zaharir for your crowns yet. Want me to pay for it from the army money? -Why not? Fuck that. -Fuck that and a half. What's wrong? -Cockroach. This big. They come from Aisha's stinky house to your spotless floors. A cockroach... It?s probably just a gecko. There's the bastard... Gecko? Go on, laugh at me. I?m sorry, Aviva. I acted like a baby at the garage. It?s not your fault. I don't get him, after all these years... Hypocrite. I was so pissed off, I went to help at Eli's joint in the community center. He gave me 50 Shekels. I can't take it anymore, Aviva. For the past 6 months, all l've done is slept. My head looks like a pillow. -I love your head. You're tickling my tummy. I love your tummy. You'll love my meat-head and I'll love your sexy tummy. We'll die from love and from not having enough money, and the roaches will eat us. Maybe I should go back to the lunch shift? No way, we already talked about it. It?s a full-time salary, Ben-Ami wants me back. For his measly 2,000 Shekels? Forget it. You're gonna write, like the professor said. What's so funny? He got away because of you. Because of me? Such a shame, about your sister. She's so sexy and sweet, she's wasting herself away. Sitting on Aryeh's eggs all day. You think she's sexy? Very. But you put out. They should've gotten divorced long ago, Anita and Aryeh. All their efforts, the miscarriages, they must be sick of themselves. You said that yesterday too. So? Strange that you're repeating it. What's so strange? Maybe you're having thoughts also. Maybe you're sick of me, too. Where did you get that ridiculous idea? Are you sick of me? You bet. And your cockroaches. Then why do you stay with me? For your money. I?m meeting him at the university. He'll kill me if I?m late to the lecture. I should've never left Avi. I should've forgiven him for trying to feel you up. Stop living in the past. You love Aryeh. What good does that do me? Avi became such a big TV producer. lf I?d have stayed with him, he would've made me a star. Get real, Anita. You can laugh all you want. He said I?m photogenic and lovely. -He's right. Then why are you laughing? Did he try hitting on you? -Hit on me? He kept showing me pictures of his kids and his beloved wife. But he asked me to come visit. Where? At his studios in Tel Aviv. He made me promise yesterday to come next time we're there. -And? He said he may even have an offer for me. What, work? Apparently. Great, you should go. -What for? See what he's talking about. What are you afraid of? You think I?m cut out for television? Anita, the guy just asked you to come visit. Answer me, do you think I am? -I think you're cute. Cute? What am l, Sesame Street? Am I cut out for it or not? How should I know? -So basically I?m not. Call him. Sorry. -Come, come. "Roof plot" "Torture cellar" We'll have coffee at my place, okay? -Sure. Didn't we say you'd start straight off with the plot? "My plot is always late," said Yona to herself. Here, look, this is exactly when it happens. Didn't you see? "l can't see anything," said Yona to herself. "My face is so swollen, "that my eyes have gone cross-eyed." This isn't working, Aviva. I understand what you're saying, I just... don't know how. Did you hear that? What? -My stomach is growling. I apologize, I have nothing in the house. That's why I didn't offer you anything. -That's okay. Let's make some tea and tell me about your new story. Anita? Avi called. He's sorry, he's stuck on location in Jerusalem and can't get away. That's okay. I have to catch my bus anyway. Her mouth is inflamed and her head swells up like a balloon. And she can't sew, everything is ruined. She has a high fever and her head is so heavy that she can't keep it up. What's sad is that she can't explain herself, can't even make a sound. That's it. It gets complicated... It?s not finished yet. My stomach is singing again. Mind if I take a look in your fridge? There's no such thing as "nothing in the house." Told you. Why don't you write anymore? I write... nice and slow. I bet everyone's waiting for your new book. I saw how your students admire you. This is what I suggest. Why don't I rewrite the story you tried correcting? As an example. You'll write it? -Rewrite it. l've actually already done it with two of your stories. Don't read it now. Take it home. Read it in peace. You continue with your new story, I'll continue rewriting and we'll see what happens. lf you agree, of course. Why are you doing this for me? -What? Everything you do. Because your writing moves me. That's all. Well? What? How did it go with Avi? Great. He took me on a tour of the studio, showed me the cameras, it was fabulous. Did he offer you anything? Nothing specific. He wants to give me an audition. A test you do for television. -I know what it is. That's it. -An audition for what? Don't know. When I know, I'll tell you, okay? You smell like garlic. I made him some shakshuka. -No way. What could I do? His stomach was croaking like he swallowed a frog. Great, next time mop his floor. I don't like it. No wonder. Yours was much more moving. l really have to pee. Why did he change her name? Why did he have to change it into first person? Call him. Here. Get up, I have to go so bad, I?m gonna explode. Maybe he forgot. He published one bestseller ten years ago and the money and fame made him forget how to write. What do I know? You have a lot to learn too. Let him handle things, he won't do anything without your okay, right? I have a bad feeling. -Me too, I?m about to pee right here on the street. What about your new story? -It?s coming along. That's all that matters. Yona was a colorless woman. Every morning brushing her hair, she'd turn and ask: "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the biggest loser of them all?" And when the mirror would answer: "It?s you, "you're the biggest loser in the world," Yona would calm down. "Because it's calming to be nothing," said Yona to herself. Her body lay there, black and still, and the three dresses stood by the window shimmering in the sunrays of late spring. "The End" So, what's it gonna be, Aviva? I don't know what to decide, Ben-Ami. I don't get you. People are getting fired here left and right and I?m offering you twice as many shifts. What's that rag on your head? Take it off, it's improper. Put it back on. Come help me with the crates. Give me an answer, I can't wait too long. Improper? You'd think this is the White House... "Yona's head swelled up like a melon..." Did you talk to her? -About what? About Holon, I asked you to. She was up all night crying. -Why? How should I know? Maybe 'cuz your mother hung up on her yesterday? She's miserable here, Aviva. "At least l finished the dresses," said Yona to herself, just before closing her eyes. Oh my God... Her body lay there, black and still, and the three dresses stood by the window shimmering in the sunrays of late spring. "Dairy" "Meat" "Pastries" What's all this talk I hear about Moni? -What talk? Mercedes and Flor said he's fooling around. What? -Where there's smoke, there's fire. You could write comedies from your dreams. Aviva, mon amour. My dreams are long gone. Promise me, Mom, Anita will be here any minute. Fine--you'd think she's Queen of England. Be nice to her, she's your daughter. -Oh yeah? For a present she gave me a vase that I got her 5 years ago. Enough with that story. You keep repeating it like a broken record. I?m a broken record? -Mom, please eat. No, I want to know. Am I broken record? -Enough! It?s not like you to talk to me that way. I thought you're civilized, not dirty like your sister, green with envy. Envy? Beware of her. Beware of everyone. Fine. How is that nice husband of yours? Thank God, fine. Still working at the garage? That's Moni, Mom. Aryeh is a cab driver. Okay, I got mixed up, kill me... Does he still hit you? No. -Good. And why don't you work? Why do you sit at home all day? I?m trying to get pregnant. That's work? It?s all in your head. -What's in my head? You can have whatever you want. -Mom! lf I had taken that job as a seamstress, I wouldn't have needed favors from anyone. I would've worked and I wouldn't have had such problems with my pregnancies. Learn from your mother's mistakes. You're only 31 , still young. 32. Why doesn't Aharon come to see me? Who's Aharon? -That nice husband of yours. -Violet... Aharon?! You don't even know his name. -Of course I do. Mom... -Then what's his name? Are you testing me? -No, statistics. I can't deal, Aviva, I?m leaving. -Take your vase with you. Stop it! My love. Am I bothering you? I can't concentrate. I think Anita's mad at me for forcing her to make up with Mom. No she's not. She did a whole routine. I haven't laughed that hard in a while. You went to see her? I went to talk to Aryeh about something. -About what? What is it? -A love letter from our dentist's lawyer. Registered mail. Look at those threats. I thought I?d get my job back, so I didn't tell you, I didn't want you to worry. That's why you went to Aryeh? Don't tell me you asked for a loan again. I waited for him to offer. He didn't. That's it. I don't like you doing that, Moni! -Neither do l, so what? Just forget about it now, OK? Let him sue me. He can take the TV, for all I care. Maybe Ofek will do something besides changing channels all day. Ofek, come on. How many times? Go to bed, sweetheart. Maybe talk to the professor. Ask if he can get you some kind of advance. It?s about time, isn't it? "Dear Oded, "I?m sending the new story about the seamstress and the doctor that I recently finished. "l've given up completely on the corrections. I can't do it. "My brain demands, but my hand refuses. "Has a mind of its own and writes new stories, like the one enclosed." Aviva... Have you lost your mind, Ofir? I quit, Aviva. Want some? It?s good stuff. When did you quit? Why? I?d rather sit at the unemployment office than cut carrots all day. Freedom, Aviva! Sprinkling, sprinkling, freedom! "I?m waiting to hear from you about our next lesson, "to ask you about the corrections you've made. "I?m sure your answers will shed some light. "It?s been months since we set out on this journey and I wonder, "will this book ever be published? Am I still worthy? "Awaiting your reply, Aviva Cohen." Ofek, you made me coffee? -Write. You've been staring at the phone for hours without writing a thing. How much sugar did you put in? Did you lock the door? Why? So it'll be quiet. What happened? What happened? Let me see! I wait for him all day, taking my temperature and he gets even with me about nonsense. Don't shush me. Just you wait, asshole! -Stop it. Sorry. We didn't even have sex. I finally have a regular period and this is what he does to me. Want your medal now or next time? Oshrat, stop it. -What medal? World's biggest chump, I heard you won first place. Leave me alone. -Hit him back, you idiot! That's enough! Get out of here. Never mind her. She's right. I?m going upstairs. -Where to? -To talk to Aryeh. Don't be ridiculous. Aviva! Why, Aryeh? Who are you to butt in like head of the tenants committee? Just because she's your sister doesn't mean she's a saint. It's time for you to understand that. But why do you hit her? -She started! -Oh please. What's this? A Halloween costume? She thinks she can snow job everyone with her tears... Since you're such a good sister, tell her that it'd be good for her if we moved back to Holon, not only for me. You promised me you'd talk to her, Aviva. I promised nothing. Want to sleep over tonight? Fuck that, he should go. Why should l go? He'll probably go to his mother in Holon, she'll feel sorry for him. Tomorrow he'll come crawling back with flowers. What am l, a grave to put flowers on? I keep fighting like an idiot to give him some kids. Why don't you stop? It?s ruining your life. Stop trying to get pregnant? -Yes. I can't believe you're saying that. -Why? You don't have to, it's not a must. Then what am I supposed to do? Wait, see what happens with the auditions, rest. Go back to it later. Fine. Aviva! They're calling you, you don't hear them? I bet Mom needs you to wipe her ass. Oh my God, it's Oded. -What?! Downstairs! What? -He called yesterday. -He called you? Your line was busy for hours. What did he say? He's coming for the weekend. -To my place? No, dummy, what are you, a hotel? -Why didn't you tell me? -I forgot! Tell him to come up. -I can't, look, the house is a mess. Idiot... Come on up! -Stop! Third floor, the Cohen family. Yoav, tell him. What's wrong with your house. It's as clean as a whistle. -Help me, okay? What should I do with Ofek? -Leave him alone. How's he bothering you? God, where are your sunglasses? Get up. Oded's here. Who? -Make sure Alon gets up. Okay? Hello. -Hello. I apologize. Anita forgot to tell me... -lf it's not a good time... No, of course not. Come in, I'll get you something cold to drink. Hello. Hello, Anita. Welcome. Sit down, would you like some coffee? There's red macaroni, if you like. -Something cold would be great, thanks. I forgot to tell her you called. She's a bit frazzled. She likes to do spring cleaning before she has company. We can do this some other time. -A little spontaneity won't kill her. Here you go. -Thank you. I imagined your house completely different. Did you come to visit your aunt? -Yes, and to relax a little. And I owe you a visit, we haven't met in a while. Oded, how is it that a man like you isn't married? I am, officially. She's been in France for the past 10 years, with our daughter. Oh, you have a daughter... Did you read what I wrote? -Yes. What did you think? We read it together. It?s fabulous. Made me cry. Good. I?m happy with it too. We need to talk, Aviva. The time has come. When will you have some time? -Am I in the way? Who took my cigarettes? Why did you let Oshrat take them? -She'll give them back, Alon. Why do you always cover for her? I apologize, he was up late last night... That's okay. I just popped in to say hello. And to arrange for us to meet later... So whenever is good for you... Idiot! Oshrat! I?m staying at your hotel. I'll go see my aunt now, but I'll be at your hotel this evening, so whenever is good for you. I?m so sorry. -Don't worry about it. Get out! Alon, you promised me. -I said, get out! Is it because of the army? No. -Don't worry, Alon, they'll realize you don't have asthma, you'll be drafted. I don't care about that. -Then what's wrong? Embarrassed about your eye-blinking? No. What about Eleanor? Why don't you see her anymore? Because. Tell me. There's nothing to tell. She left me. I can't live without her. You're young, you'll love someone else and she'll love you back. Don't worry. But she does love me. Then why did you break up? Because I can't with her. Can't what? I can't with her. I don't understand. When we have sex, I can't do it. You should talk to Dad, I don't know about these things. I already did. What did he say? -To talk to Anita. She said I should drink some arak beforehand, that that would help me. So did you? -Yeah. It gave me a headache and Eleanor said I stink. I hate the smell of arak too. I want you to go back to therapy, Alon. But it costs tons of money. -Don't worry about the money. Did you calm down? Oshrat, do me a favor and keep away from Alon. You're going back to the base tomorrow anyway. I tried calming him, but he freaked out again. Don't talk about him like that. Is that for me? I don't want it if it's turkey. -You know chicken is expensive. You wouldn't skimp on Alon. Maybe I should pretend to freak out like he always does over a quarter. All you ever talk about is our situation, that there's no money, l've had it! -So have l! -Then go to work! All of a sudden you're a writer? What happened? Nothing. -Why don't you go to the hotel? He's waiting. I have to be here so they don't kill each other. How do you know about that anyway? -Anita told me. Oh, really? Again you went to talk with them? I bumped into her. Why are you so mad? lf you were at home, I wouldn't have been humiliated. I?m looking for work, Aviva. -Really? Where exactly? With whom? I?m sick of this, Moni! Moni? You scared me. What are you doing here? What's wrong, Moni? Something you want to tell me? Why are you crying? I promised you it would be okay, didn't l? Just give me some time. Take this, so you'll know I?m not just saying it. Why didn't you tell me about this? You applied for college, alone? Anita helped me with the forms. She gave me some money. Don't worry, Oshrati, there are other colleges. Try somewhere else, I'll help you. Don't feel sorry for me now and don't pretend to be surprised that I wasn't accepted. Why are you saying that? Why won't you let me read your stories, Mom? What's that got to do with it? -Answer me. Why? I didn't think you were interested. You think nothing interests me. I never said that. -But you're right. Nothing really interests me. Not a thing. Where were you? I stick out like a sore thumb with these glasses. Why did you come? Did you know that Oshrat applied to college? And Alon's problems with Eleanor that he came to talk to you about? Why didn't you tell me? I just didn't. I didn't want them disturbing you, you hardly get any peace and quiet to write as it is. -I see. Forget about that, he's waiting for us. I?m going in alone. -Why? -Because. I want to alone. What if he wants to talk business? -Let him. Aviva, you're not good at that stuff. -Enough, Anita, please! Don't be offended. He probably wants to talk about what he wrote and I need to tell him a few things. Fine. Do what's best for you. I'll be at home, tell him I say hi. Is this suite your doing? -It was Ben-Ami, my boss. He likes to spoil important guests. Have some, they're delicious. -Thank you. It?s not working, Aviva. -I know. You don't need to tell me. I don't know how to correct it. I?m not sure I want to. I have to work full-time again. Ben-Ami's even saving me a shift. I don't have time, everything is falling apart. -Take it easy. First, I want you to have this. What is it? -It?s from me. Why? -I owe you. You owe me 8,000 Shekels? -Even more. Thanks to you, I?m writing again. Put it in your bag, otherwise I won't go on. I can't. -Don't insult me. It?s yours, end of story. The problem isn't your stories. They're wonderful. The problem is that in today's situation, no one will publish a book of an unknown writer. Even with all my contacts, it won't work. They're not interested. The thing is, they've been expecting a new book from me for a long time. They'll print anything I give them. As long as my name is on the cover. And that's what I?m proposing. I don't understand. I?m proposing that we publish your stories in my book. I know this must be surprising. But think it over. It?s what you've always wanted. Now you have the opportunity. But they're my stories. -You'll get credit in the book. Credit? Your name will be mentioned as head researcher or something. I'll do all the work. Of course you'll get paid for it. I'll give you an advance, quite a sizable sum. lf there are any profits, we'll split them. It?s quite a bit of money for you. You'll be able to write in peace. You want to buy my stories and for me to give up my name. Why? -I told you, it's an excellent solution. I don't want to. I don't expect an answer right now. I know this is hard to digest. Think about it. I'll be here till Monday. You have time, think it over. Where's Aviva? Moni, what's wrong? Moni, are you crying? Come on, tell me what's wrong. Where's Aviva? Stop it, Moni, knock it off... Stop it, let go of me! Tell Aviva I?m waiting for her. Shame on you, especially with your son in the next room. You've gone too far. Aviva. Are you asleep? Aviva? ...And most important, he said complexes are no big deal. I don't understand. You don't have to start with therapy straight away, he said I basically seem okay. I should go down to the Sinai for a week or two, lie on the beach. Walk around naked for a few days, there's a special beach for that, he told me where. I don't understand. He sent you to a nudist beach? -Yes. So I'll feel more comfortable with my body and my complexes will settle down. -What is this nonsense? He recommended that you be a nudist? He charged 200 Shekels for that? -No. He'll charge only if I continue therapy. The Sinai is cheaper than therapy, no? When do you want to go? Tomorrow, even. How much do you need? I figure 1,000 Shekels oughta do it. Hi. Where were you last night? Why? Dad kissed Anita while you were gone. What? -You heard me. Don't pretend you didn't Turn off the TV when I?m talking to you. Aviva honey. Your cookies are better than your mother's, when she still did something in her kitchen. Dad made them. Zaki made them? Why not... Like I always say, if a man wants to cook, fine, but he shouldn't make a mess. You've become a feminista? What feminista? My late father used to make great cookies. Where did you learn to be a feminista? At that university in Tunis? Aviva, sit. We didn't come here to talk politics. Sit, my dear. You know I love your mother more than my own sister. lf she'd only take her pills... we'd all be better off and suffer less. Wait a minute! Even your father is at a loss. What did she do? Ask what she didn't do. She turns on the TV, sits there and laughs so loud, people think she's slaughtering cats, she fights with everyone, yelling from the window. You bastards, you're all suckers! And yesterday? I?m ashamed, you tell her. Naked. Naked? -Took off all her clothes and was yelling from the window. "Look at me, you're all in prison and only l am free." With all her thingies hanging out. Don't work yourself up so much. Have some tea. Put something on. Now! What is this? -I told you I have to go to the Sinai. lf you don't have the money, I'll do here what I?m supposed to do there. Lemme get this, are you threatening me? Call the psychologist, I?m not the one who decides. We agreed you'd wait a while, I'll ask Grandpa for money. I don't have time to wait for Grandma. It?s Friday, the bus leaves in 3 hours. I either leave or I go downstairs like this, everyone can suck my dick, there's enough for everyone. Pack your things, go to the station, I'll get what you need, but get dressed first. Okay. Now! -Okay. It's a good thing you called. I don't know what to do. Where is she? -In the bathroom for the past 3 hours. Hasn't taken her pills in two days. Yells at me that I hate her. I hate her? Aviva, mon amour. Mom, what are you doing? Swimming. What did you father put in this lousy Jacuzzi for? What's with all the candles? I saw them do it on TV, so why shouldn't l? When's the last time you ate? Are you starving yourself? I had some watermelon seeds, that's enough. What do you want now? You're an embarrassment. -Really? You oughta see what's going on with your husband who's making you a cuckold. Don't be ridiculous. You think I don't know about these things? I know too well, from all the years your father cheated on me. Laugh at me all you want, but for your information, cheating is genetic. Genetic? But Moni isn't Dad's son. -Yes, but you're my daughter. I?m not like you. -Sure. You're a writer. -Stop it already, I?m not a writer! That's right. Show me one writer who works in a kitchen. This isn't Vegas, this is Tiberias. People live so that they'll have bread to eat, not to dance. But you're a serious person. Get those fantasies out of your head and get things in order before you really become like me. Make me something to eat. Make it yourself. Where are you going? You said you need some money. I don't need anything. "Aviva" Here, it's a long ride. So you don't dehydrate. Are you okay, Mom? -I?m fine. Promise you won't hitchhike. Thank Grandpa for me for the money. -I did, and don't say anything, he doesn't want you to know it's from him. This is for next month, the second is a bit after. We'll talk about the rest after it's published. Only good will come out of this, I promise. I don't care anymore. We each should do what's right for us. Aviva, I need your signature. It?s just a formality. "Aviva Cohen hereby authorizes..." Aren't you going to read it? What for? Where have you been hiding? Why are you avoiding me? -I?m not. What did Oded say? Nothing. He didn't talk about the book? So it was work, as usual? -What business is it of yours what I do? Why are you lashing out at me? -'Cuz I feel like it, okay? Do I poke my nose into all your auditions? -It's really too bad you don't. Why? 'Cuz there are no auditions and there won't be any. Don't you get it? Then what were all those stories? Stories. Why? There's one thing I want to know. Are you messing around with Moni? Maybe you're lying to me about that too. Answer me. What's come over you? -Do me a favor and get your hands off my family. Deal with your auditions and ovulations and leave me alone, okay? You think you can get away with everything. And if you want to know why your husband jumped me like some pervert, then ask him yourself 'cuz it's none of my business. You turned me into such a pathetic nobody. You want alone? Fine. Hey, Aviva, where's Moni? What do you want from him? -I wanna thank him. He's sleeping, leave him alone. It'd be a shame to wake him, he works so hard. Too bad. I wanted to thank you both, we're finally getting the hell out of here, like l've wanted for so long. I told Anita to come say goodbye. After all, you're her sister, right? But she's too busy, packing. Aviva, mon amour. -Mom, what are you doing here? That's the welcome I get? I got all dressed up for you. What's with the bag? I left your father. Ran out on him. He's not a bad man, your father. I just don't care any more what's good or bad. What are you going to do now, Mom? I?m going back to the institution. Anita is dropping me there on the way. I?m admitting me. I'll ask them to let me cook. I feel like cooking, cleaning. Why wouldn't they take in someone like me? What about me? What do you need me for? You don't need anybody, get that into your head. My darling. My beauty. Don't get mad at me for talking nonsense sometimes. Now I won't be a bother to you, you'll be able to write in peace. I just want you to know that it was nothing. I lost control for a moment. Okay. Forgive me, Aviva. We've been together since 8th grade, you know I?m worthless. I?m not going to console you now. Didn't ask you to. You're so busy all the time. Your mother, the kids, your professors. You disappeared on me, Aviva. I?m taking Ben-Ami's offer. Why? Because I want to. I left him a message that I can start tomorrow. He wants me 5 days a week, morning and afternoon. I?m happy there. When will you write your stories? I don't know. I don't have to sit at home to write. I don't have to write at all. And I definitely don't have to involve you in it. It?s mine. So don't touch it. Good night. My spring will come On a summer or winter day My spring will come On a rainy or sunny day "Luna My Love, by Oded Zar" "Luna My Love, by Oded Zar" "Research Assistant: A. Cohen" "If you sew three fairytale dresses for me..." Aviva. It?s 5:15. -Thanks. Why are you up? I wanna get the house ready for Alon. What's it gonna be, Aviva? It?s been 6 months, when will you come back to sleep with me? They won't let me sell, so we'll see. Maybe I'll get some Russian to rent one room. But what about Mom? She's not coming back, when will you understand that? How do you know? Six months and you haven't visited her even once. You should ask her, it's her house too. -I did. When? -Last week, I went to see her. You didn't tell me. -There was nothing to tell. What do you mean? -Don't get mad at me! I sat there for two hours, waiting for her. Watching her walk around with the food she made. Singing, saying: "Eat, eat, so you'll have strength. "Crazy people need lots of strength." She's thriving there, Aviva. Why would she want to come back? What about you? Everything's fine. -Yeah? Alon is finishing basic training today, Oshrat is studying. Everything's fine. -Then why are you so sad? No one needs you anymore? Is that why you're not writing? No. -Then why? Because I?m not cut out for it, okay? What about that writer of yours? Nothing. Hi. Look, Avrum gave it to me from the fisherman. Did you see Alon downstairs? -Yeah. What? Nothing. Can you come with me for a minute? -Where to? I wanna talk to you, okay? Well? Since it's my pre-discharge leave, I sat and thought what I want to do with myself. Yeah. I decided that I want to be a prostitute. What did you say? Think about it: tons of money, no need to study. Are you crazy? What's this nonsense? -What's wrong with prostitution? Always plenty of work. Besides, you're better off selling your body than your soul. You don't think so? Where'd you get that? -Anita gave it to me. She wanted to see what that bastard of yours wrote. What do you want now? -Explain to me why you did it. Why, Mom? -It?s none of your business. I admire you, like an idiot, thinking you were someone who goes all the way, doesn't give up. Drop it, Oshrat. -Okay. Only if you go see him tomorrow morning. What for? -To get back everything you wrote over the years. Stop pretending. Anita told me he has everything. Go tomorrow before that shit steals more from you. I?m warning you, Oshrat. Don't butt in on my life and don't tell anyone about this, it's my own personal matter. What's wrong with you? The professor wants to meet her tomorrow and she's afraid to go. Really? -Oshrat. -Yeah. He said it's time they talked about a contract. Excuse me. Alon, help me set the table, please. That snob finally remembers her, and she freaks out. He really wants to talk about a contract? C'mon, Aviva. -I can't, I?m working tomorrow. Ofir will fill in for you. This is your big chance. -What are they talking about? Mom, you have to. -Get off my back! Leave her, she'll go some other time. Drop it! Too bad... I had a feeling I?d see you before I leave. I told you about my daughter in France, didn't l? Such a sweet girl. Thirsty? There's cola in the fridge. No thanks. What did you come for? You didn't deposit the checks I gave you, right? Okay, I'll write out new ones, if that's what you want. You used me. I didn't force you. It was your decision. All your promises... You lied to me. You turned to me. It was you and your sister's initiative. What are you accusing me of? That your stories touched my soul? Then I plead guilty. All the rest is your business. What do you want now? Do you know what you want? I want my stories. Which? Everything I gave you, that Anita sent you, I want them back. Why? -Because they're mine! Because my whole life is in there! Because I have to write and I can't write with all my things here. Don't you understand? Afraid I'll kick up a fuss? You have my signature, no need to worry. Keep what you already took, just give me back the rest of my papers and let me go. Go see your daughter in peace. I?m serious. I?m not leaving 'til you give me back my stories. The book is hardly selling. Did you know that? The publishers don't understand why. I shouldn't have touched it. I only ruined it. Your sister is right. I just don't have it. She's right... Anita spoke with you? She wrote me a letter, she's not a bad writer either. You didn't know at all, huh? I?m glad she sent me a letter and not a bomb. Go home, Aviva. Write your stories. "Dear Professor Oded, "I?m offering you some friendly advice to read this letter. "I may not seem like much to you, but for your information, I have contacts in television "that could be very detrimental to you. "Recently I realized that you are a weak man and a thief. "You used my sister and for that I won't forgive you. "You took advantage of her naivety and of the fact "that she doesn't believe in herself and thinks she doesn't deserve anything. "You're right, she doesn't believe in herself, "but not every woman who walks around in a miniskirt "deserves to get groped, right? "Presently, I?m unable to come and settle scores with you. "I suggest you do what needs to be done. "Meanwhile, I?m casting a spell on your head: "You'll never write another word. I?m not worried about Aviva, "she'll write, because she has to. Because she is a writer. "As for you - your hand will go dry because you have no soul. I volunteered for our building's tenants committee. They're afraid of me, so they pay on time. It?s nice here. Except everyone speaks Russian, so I have no one to argue with. Anita? What? When are you coming back? Come back. Please. I know I said I want alone, but I can't alone. I need you. To read, to type for me. You don't need me. -Yes I do. I only get in your way. -I need you to get in my way. I can't write a word with all this quiet. C'mon, you've turned into such a crybaby. We're happy here, Aviva. Just yesterday I said to Aryeh that I want him to bring you here sometime. No way I?m gonna lie in bed for months all alone. He said he'd be glad to bring you. He's become so sweet. He's so excited... Shhh, we're not talking about it. l am writing my story. l was a colorless woman, with neither looks nor grace. Until one day, a messenger appeared at my doorway. Whether he brought me a curse or a blessing - l shall never know. "Aviva - our writer" l am writing the sewage pipes that explode on my head when my eyes wish to close. l am writing my mother's sewing pins that prick me when l nurse her soul. l am writing my sister's beautiful fingers that embrace my life and prop up my back every time it is about to break. l am writing my own story. My spring will come On a summer or winter day My spring will come On a rainy or sunny day My spring will come On a summer or winter day My spring will come On a rainy or sunny day My love My beloved My loved ones Will come from all over to the town square My dear My dears My dearest ones In the spring l shall sing for you English: Suzy De Lowe Edited by: Gideon Klionsky Subtitles: Cinematyp Studios Ltd.
