[ Music playing ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] ## Hey, sugar, would you get a cigar? [ Continues singing softly ] Corbett, let's go. That's a nice touch, don't you think? The Japanese are very near. We must be going. Oh, thanks a lot. Oh, now, come on, honey. Now, this is war. I'm gonna be back one of these days, you understand? Corbett, please, let's go. Gents, I don't think we made a deal yet. We made a deal back in Manila! $5,000 to fly us to a safe place. No fish market haggling with me, the price is 10,000. Oh, that's extremely too much. Extremely too much. Cash in advance. [ Gunfire ] Well, gents, looks like this is it. Corbett... [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Groans ] [ Gunfire continues ] [ Engine starting ] [ Gunfire ] We could've been dead! You and your stupid haggling for money! Wanted to make sure I didn't die broke! [ Engine sputtering ] What's wrong? As a paid up passenger on the Corbett Air Service, you got two choices. What's that? You got two choices. We can either crash in the jungle, where the Japs would pick us up in an hour, or we can crash on Corregidor, if I keep this old dog up in the air. It's got bullets in its wind-pipe. [ Engine sputtering ] Corregidor. That's right. It's the only store on the block the Japs don't own yet! You better hold on to something else, if you don't wanna crash though the roof! What the hell is that? Mario, go check that plane. [ Crashing ] CORBETT: Let's get out of here before it blows! [ Music playing ] [ Explosion ] [ Music playing ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire continues ] - Here. - What's that for? It's your change, I promised you a one-way ticket to a safe island, well, this ain't it. Damn, there can't be any Japs here. Halt and be recognized! Friend or foe? [ Gunfire continues ] That's all the Army I know. Betty Grable! [ Gunfire ] That was the password. The Yanks won the series! We're American! [ Music playing ] [ Speaks Filipino ] I'm too tall to be a Jap! [ Music playing ] [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Vehicle approaching ] [ Indistinct chatter ] Francisco, is there any sign of the submarine yet? Not yet. It won't come now. It's too light. Maybe tonight. Where's Colonel Turner? Colonel is at the barge. [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Music playing ] [ Engine rumbling ] CORBETT: Hey, Colonel. Colonel, will you tell these fellas that I ain't a Jap? Corbett? What the hell are you doing playing soldier? I figure nobody ever got hurt playing soldier. It's this real stuff that gets nasty. Well, what do you expect flying in here with a rising sun painted on your plane? CORBETT: Oh, that, yeah. Well, that was... that was just a little kindergarten camouflage. Look, I was... I was flying a client. I was flying a client off the island. Bernabe. Colonel, I know that man. He's Bernabe, the traitor. His business is war and stabbing the Filipino people. TURNER: Bernabe, yeah. I've heard of him. He hijacks our supplies and then sell them to the highest bidder of the Japanese. Sir, he's telling a lie. He's telling a lie! [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Indistinct chatter ] ...even without a trial! Without a trial! [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Gunfire ] [ Music playing ] Turner, would you point out to these fellas that I was just lugging him off the island for a price? I wasn't trying to sell out flag and country. I hope you got a good price. Bring a stretcher over here. He was the biggest fish, I waited him out. JOAN: Like a vulture. I'm a businessman, not a soldier. Why don't you butt out, sweet-cheeks? All right. Tell them to leave him alone. [ Speaks Filipino ] All right, get up to the infirmary, and get that arm fixed. They won't kill you, but they won't love you. That hurts. TURNER: Somebody pick up that body. All right, let's go. Here we go, here we go. All right, let's go, everybody. Back to work. Come on, let's go. [ Music playing ] Anything yet? No. CORBETT: Mess kits. [ Music playing ] - What are we doing here? - Get your shirt off. [ Music playing ] Okay. Get him out of here. He's dead. Sit down over here. That's... some bedside manner you got there. Chip Corbett's the name, Ma'am. You're blocking my light. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna have to stitch it up. Can I have a bullet to bite on? Hmm? [ Gasps ] [ Submarine sonar beeping ] [ Music playing ] [ Gushing ] Now, what's going on here? A war. Ow. [ Speaks Filipino ] Long live the Philippines. [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Music playing ] Francisco. - FRANCISCO: Yes, Colonel? - On the double... get those last two crates aboard, - hurry up. - Yes. - [ Speaks Filipino ] - There she is. [ Cheering ] Now, what's going on here? I'm sending a shipment of supplies to Australia. CORBETT: Australia? On that submarine? Yeah, that's right. CORBETT: Wait for me! TURNER: Francisco, get that man off of there. Get him off of there! What's he doing? He's gonna get himself shot. - [ Punch landing ] - [ Splashing ] [ Music playing ] [ Engine rumbling ] Jap Zero! [ Honking ] [ Gunfire ] [ Engine rumbling ] No! [ Gunfire ] Dammit, get the hell away from my sub! [ Bombs whistling ] [ Explosions ] [ Music playing ] All right, Santos, we have our orders. Take charge of getting those crates lashed to the bottom of that barge. Madrigal, make sure they stay there. - Wait. - Romero, get that dynamite rig, on the double. [ Speaks Filipino ] Don't worry, Joan. You know, if the Japs suspected anything beyond the sinking of the submarine, the action would be even thicker around here. Why don't you just hide it someplace on the island? In a few days, the Japs would be swarming around this rock, but they won't be swarming on the bottom of the sea. Corbett, your next stunt gets you shot. [ Laughs ] That's a great idea, just great. Tying the crates to the bottom of a barge like that, it's great. Looks like you busted open those stitches. Hmm? Except maybe for the weight. I don't know if that lashing's gonna hold. Boy, you sure did. Of course, if, um... Well, if you took down the crates, they'd take up a lot less space, you know. What? Huh? What did I do? Huh? [ Music playing ] Three miles due south. We will always know where it is. Yes, till the end of the war. Yeah, but who's gonna be alive to remember? The Philippines. [ Music playing ] A Jap patrol boat! Sink that barge! [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Howitzers firing ] MAN: They're on a raid, sir. Oh, my God. They've got it all. Well, I guess, this just isn't our day. Now, you can't tell me those suckers out there died for mess kits, what the hell is this "it" the Japs got? The future of the Philippines. But what is it? - Gold. - How much? [ Music playing ] [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Engines rumbling ] Bring the gold. [ Speaks Filipino ] How much? How much? [ Howitzers firing ] [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Explosion ] [ Explosion ] [ Speaks Filipino ] Tell me how much gold is on the barge. [ Speaks Filipino ] How much gold is on the barge? Enough. [ Explosions ] [ Gunfire ] JOAN: Get me a stretcher! Santos. [ Gunfire ] Hey, you know, we might be able to get that gold back. How much was on the barge? I don't know. [ Explosion ] [ Gunfire ] Hey, wait a minute, I didn't hear you! When you come back, a stretcher. Help me, oh, will you help me with this man? Sure. Lady, do you know how much gold the Japs got away with? Do you know how much gold was on the barge? A hundred million dollars in gold bullion. What? [ Explosions ] [ Engines rumbling ] [ Explosion ] [ Gunshots ] [ Explosion ] [ Speaks Filipino ] Mario and Colonel, they don't seem to agree with you. But where the hell else could they take it? The only oil depot is in Manila Bay. Right there on the Pasig River. Corregidor falls, they'll use it as an oil barge to supply their ships around the island. Yes. And once they use that, they will discover the gold. Then, we must sink it before Corregidor falls. Yes, without our ocean, their suspicion that our prime target is the gold. How much time do you think we have? Corregidor could surrender any minute. I'd say five, six days. What about the underground, you think they could do the job? Yes, Colonel, the guerrillas we can... Colonel, it's an impossible task because the old dam is heavily guarded. Any such a thing will be a waste of life. But that's the only way. That gold means the future of the Philippines. Without it, we have no hope. Francisco, you don't have to explain to me what it means. I know that without it, it is impossible after the war to rebuild our islands, to finance a new government. Without it, a lot of people will die of hunger and... Then, let the guerillas sink it. It's the only chance we have. We don't have airplanes that can fly over and drop a bomb on it. That gold means Philippine independence. We are not talking about Independence. [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] - SANTOS: [ Speaks Filipino ] All right. All right! SANTOS: [ Speaks Filipino ] TURNER: Let's get back to the problem. How are we gonna sink that barge? JOAN: I know where there's an airplane. The plane is no problem. It's getting to it that's a problem. But where is it? Well, it's in Mamburao near my father's mission. Mamburao? He used it to fly supplies in. It hasn't been used since his death. But I'm sure it can be made to fly. How the hell are you gonna get a hundred and eighty miles through Jap infested territory to Mamburao? FRANCISCO: Colonel, the guerillas on the mainland could help us. But how do we get past the headhunters of Mamburao? The Balungos are no problem. I can get us through there. Joan, you can't go on a mission like that. It's too dangerous. Well, it's no more dangerous than staying here. No one of you, Colonel, are going to get through the Balungos without me. I know those people, I've lived with them for 10 years. I can get us through. I think we are jumping too fast here. There is not a single pilot here in Corregidor. Uh, excuse me for bothering your problem like this, but if it concerns a pilot, I might be of some help. What kind of a plane is it? Oh, it's a... I don't know. Not a two-seater, is it? JOAN: Oh, it's bigger than that. And it's a seaplane. Well, now, let's just do some assuming here for a minute, now, suppose that we can get from Corregidor to the mainland, and you know that's about a two, two-mile swim. And suppose that we can get from there to... - Was it Mamburao? - Yes. Uh-huh. I don't much like the idea of being led through headhunter country, but let's say that we're there, we're at the plane, and it flies. Now, what would it take to sink that barge from the air, Colonel? We could rig mortar shells with dynamite. A direct hit anywhere, would sink it. Wouldn't have to carry more than 200 pounds, would it? - Mm-mmm. - Well, let's see. From the plane to Manila is... maybe 180, 200 miles. You know, with a little luck, I think I can make it. Unless, there's another pilot on this rock, Colonel? No. Well, it looks to me like you fellas are drawin' to an inside straight, and I'm the card who fits in the middle. Mr. Corbett, you don't really believe that we would allow the future of my country to be placed into the hands of a man that deals with traitors? Well, I understand your problem, I appreciate your concern, but if there's anybody to take my place, I'll gladly step aside, but I just don't see that we have a choice here. Of course, we could all just sit around on our duffs and wait till the Japanese get the gold, if that's what you want. You don't fool me. A man of your background and character won't do such things for nothing, but... Well, now, wait a minute, wait, wait. Hold on just a minute. Who said I was gonna do it for nothing? I don't have that kind of character, you're right. What is your price, Mr. Corbett? Hmm? I said, what is your price? Well, I'll be fair about this, I think I should get... well, I think it should be something that I can see, something that I can, you know, feel, touch, smell. Something I can depend on, so, I guess, maybe that would be the airplane. I'll tell you what we'll do, you give me that airplane and I'll fly down the Pasig River, the Japs will think I'm gonna bomb the oil depot in Manila. And while I'm there, I'll drop a bomb right in the middle of the Batangas and sink the gold for you. And the airplane is mine lock, stock, and barrel, clear title. I get a little wind in my tail, I might have a ticket to safety. It's a little chancy, but it's the only one I got. Is it a deal? [ Explosions ] [ Music playing ] Jap patrol boat. Duck. [ Engine roaring ] [ Music playing ] Feel like changing your diaper? I'd rather change my mind. [ Music playing ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Music playing ] Easy with the bombs. [ Grunts ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshots continue ] JOAN: He's hit! [ Gunshot ] Get him off the beach. Hurry! Get those bombs. [ Music playing ] [ Groans ] CORBETT: Put him down. Joan, forget that. Listen, make sure that Corbett doesn't get in that plane alone, if he does, you fly right to the nearest and safest island. You... you crazy bastard. You sink that barge. [ Groans ] [ Music playing ] He's dead. Let's go. [ Music playing ] - [ Speaks Japanese ] - [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] MAN: [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Drums playing ] Colonel... Robert... A. Turner. Assigned to high command. [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Music playing ] [ Speaks Filipino ] How much farther to the road? [ Speaks in Filipino ] MAN: [ Speaks in Filipino ] Flashlight. This is the road that the Japanese use four, five miles away. You think we could make it by dawn? What are we gonna do with a road full of Japs? Well, it's awful hard to find a truck in the middle of a rice paddy. You're gonna highjack a Jap truck? Ma'am, you... you don't play the odds. We've only got five or six days to make it to Pagal. We'll never make it there without transportation. Well, why don't we just go by carabao? Back in the nice and safe back country somewhere, huh? I'm gonna have to sew that up again when I have the time. Well, that's decent of you. It's all right. It's my job to see to it you make it there with two arms to fly with. The sight of blood doesn't bother you, does it? Not when it's yours. - MAN: [ Speaks Japanese ] - MAN: [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Music playing ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Music playing ] [ Fire crackling ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Screaming ] [ Engine rumbling ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Engine revving ] [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshots continue ] [ Engine revving ] [ Gunshots continue ] [ Gunshot ] [ Music playing ] Get those clothes off them. Get them off the road. [ Music playing ] Let's go. [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Engine revving ] Here, put this on. You were told to stay in a safe place. If you got yourself killed playing hero, you would've ruined the whole mission. Now, look, sweetheart, if this truck had gotten away, the chances of my getting to that plane and off this island would've been somewhat slimmer. That was necessity work, and it wasn't courage. By the way, that was a nice pitch you did back there. Thanks. Of course, you were the only one who qualified for the job. [ Engine rumbling ] [ Singing in Filipino ] There's no more road left to Pagalion. They have been radioed. There will be enough supplies and guerrillas waiting to help us. Good. Then from there, it's only 10 more miles to the jungle to Mambuki. [ Gunshot ] - [ Speaks Japanese ] - [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] - [ Speaks Japanese ] - [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Engine rumbling ] - Thirsty? - Oh, thank you. Duck! That noonday traffic's getting a little thick. [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Phone ringing ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Engine revving ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] - [ Speaks Japanese ] - [ Speaks Japanese ] Roadblock. Oh, give me a stick of dynamite. Match. [ Music playing ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Hissing ] [ Explosion ] [ Gunshots ] [ Music playing ] Back home, I'd have won me a stogie for shooting like this. Francisco, you take the wheel. Yes, Ma'am. Corbett, come on, get into the truck. Dynamite! Roll it, Francisco! SANTOS: [ Speaks Filipino ] Get down! [ Explosions ] [ Engine rumbling ] [ Speaks Japanese ] I would say we're... 25 miles from Pagal. We're making good time. Japs find what's left of that burned-out checkpoint, afraid it's not gonna be good enough. [ Engine rumbling ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Engine revving ] [ Gunshots ] [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Gunshots continue ] [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Music playing ] MAN: [ Speaks Filipino ] They're Filipinos. Could be, and it could be a Jap trick. [ Speaks Filipino ] MAN: [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] - MAN: [ Speaks Filipino ] - MAN: [ Speaks Filipino ] - MAN: [ Speaks Filipino ] - MAN: [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] - MAN: [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Indistinct chatter ] They are Filipinos. [ Laughing and cheering ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] - Thanks for shooting down our truck, you stupid bastard! [ Laughing ] [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] - There is roadblock ahead. The Japanese can be here any minute now. Can they get us around it? [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] - We can pass there. Let's get the bombs off the truck. - [ Speaks Filipino ] - Come on, let's go! Get rid of those Jap jackets. Get those bombs. [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] He and one man will lead us to Pagal. - How long will it take? - One day and a half to two days - by mountain path. - Let's go. [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Music playing ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Music playing ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Music playing ] CORBETT: Can we rest a minute? Santos, we'll rest here. SANTOS: [ Speaks Filipino ] You know, if time is of the essence now that we've passed the roadblock, why don't we get back to the road? We don't dare hijack another Jap truck. They'd guess our destination and be swarming all over Pagal. Who said anything about hijack? You know, the Japs may be on Corregidor in a day or two. We're wasting time running around over these mountains like a bunch of goats. Well, we'll just have to pray for our luck. You make your luck. [ Engine rumbling ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] - [ Speaks Japanese ] - [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Music playing ] There've been four trucks by here in the past hour. When are we gonna hitch that ride? Well, we're waiting for an empty one. This waiting is getting to my belly. Does flying smugglers and traders get you in the belly, too? You get to where you don't think about it, you think about the buck. That's what it's all about, isn't it? For all of us. The buck, right? Those men on Corregidor, they're not dying because of a buck. What are they dying for? Maybe somebody else's buck and they don't know it, but they're dying for it. You think I'm blind? I saw a submarine sunk, a dozen or so men bombed, strafed and shot... all for a load of gold. That's the biggest buck of all, isn't it? Gold? Sir, more trucks below. This could be it. [ Engine rumbling ] [ Music playing ] CORBETT: That's it. It's empty. When the convoy stops, get in the last truck. I'll meet you. [ Music playing ] [ Engine rumbling ] MAN: [ Speaks Japanese ] MAN: [ Speaks Japanese ] MAN: [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Engine revving ] MAN: [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Engine revving ] [ Music playing ] [ Lightning crashing ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Thunder rumbling ] [ Music playing ] JOAN: Come on. [ Music playing ] MAN: [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Music playing ] Hmm. If it's like this on "Bomb the Batangas" day, you'd be lucky if you find a river. If it's like this, I'll be lucky if I'm not in the river. You know, the chances of you flying away from that barge are pretty slim. Why are you doing it? Well, I'll tell you, honeybunch, I look at it like this. The chances of a good pilot getting away clean are about 50/50, so I figure my odds are more like three to one. You didn't answer my question. Couldn't it be because a part of you wants to help the Filipino people? After all, you reap what you sow. Yeah, yeah, I know. And if I cast my own bread upon the water, I'll get back a whole sandwich, right? Hmm? You better lay off me, preacher's daughter. I am what I am because of me. If I crack up, it's gonna be because I make a mistake. Nobody else. MAN: [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Music playing ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Engine revving ] [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] What do you think? Too early. We'll wait for an hour. If we don't see any Japs, then, it's safe. Japs or no Japs, we still send a man down to check. Arm inspection. [ Laughing ] How you doing, sport? It's so quiet here on Luzon after that night and day shelling on Corregidor. Wish I could stay awake to enjoy it. No infection. Still should stitch it up in Pagal. [ Praying in Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] - Corbett? - [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Praying in Filipino ] MAYOR: [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] We sent Francisco down to check when they had to move out some. That's it. [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Music playing ] MAN: [ Speaks Filipino ] MAN: [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Indistinct chatter ] MAN: [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Indistinct chatter ] - MAN: [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] - How are you? - Mr. Corbett. Mr. Corbett, sir. Has Corregidor fallen yet? No, not yet. Has there been any Japanese in this village? We haven't had any for the past two weeks. I'm gonna have to have some place where I can fix up Mr. Corbett's arm. You may use my house. Come with me. Mr. Corbett, the Philippines will never forget you for what you're attempting to do. Oh, that's all right, just give me a handful of cigars, - we'll call it even. - [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] Please come with me. [ Engines rumbling ] Maria? Maria. Take care of their needs. If you'll excuse me, I'll take care of your supplies for the rest of your job. Thank you. Uh, Maria, I'll need some disinfectant. Alcohol, iodine, anything like that. Yes, Ma'am, I have some. You better take off those socks. I thought it was my arm. I'll have to try to find a clean pair for you. If I can't, I'll have to wash those. I don't want any fungus blighting your walls. No, I don't think a doctor as dirty as you should operate. I wash what I have to and get the rest later. Am I as dirty as you? No, just shows up more. [ Music playing ] Oh, thank you. Can I be of any help? Ah... naw... You don't wanna see a grown man cry, do you? We'll call you. You know, I'm gonna say something, Corbett, and I don't want you to say anything in reply. But you are doing something very valuable for the Filipinos, and we appreciate it. Oh, okay, okay. Maria? Just go ahead and get your tools torched already. Sweetheart, have you got any of that other kind of alcohol? Basi? Yes, I'll get it for you. You didn't need any of that the last time I did this. You never know when a drink's gonna be your last. The headhunters may not carry my brand. - May I pour it for you? - Oh, yes, please. Thank you. We may have little together later. Maybe. Maria... Don't forget the cigars. Bye-bye. [ Gasping ] Lady, you're gonna make a drunk out of me, you know? Whatever brought you to the Philippines in the first place? Year and a half on a freighter, getting tired of reading books, jumped ship, Manila, I was looking for the buck. Little craps, little cards, built an inside straight, so I stayed. And the war came along and knocked Humpty Dumpty off of his wall. Oh, no, no, that's when the prices got right. I wanted one big one before I cut out, sort of a five-year nest-egg. So I went to the game with guts and caught a pair. Bernabe. And his buddy... Jesus. Back to back. You don't really care very much for people, do you? Sure, I do. They don't cause me no worry. Don't you approve? I wouldn't worry about it. You don't approve of me, do you? Hmm? I'm a distasteful example of American free enterprise, right? I'm not here to judge you. You're doing something very valuable for the Philippine people. I don't care why. "Judge ye not, lest ye be judged so, and ye shall reap." Don't you preacher's daughters ever use words like love and sex? Maybe you don't know what they mean. I'm not a sex-starved virgin of the jungle, Mr. Corbett. I'm a deeply fulfilled married woman, and I know what those words mean. You're married? Yes. I assumed you knew that. No. [ Chuckling ] Well, here's to sex, love, and the American mother. [ Engines rumbling ] [ Water splashing ] [ Ducks quacking ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] MAN: [ Speaks Filipino ] Francisco, have you seen Corbett? No, not since morning. Better go find him. MAN: The radio says there's no change at Corregidor. They've loaded your bombs and supplies on carabao. We'll summon if you need them. Actually, the fewer men, the better going into Mamburao. There's some ammunition if you need it. Good. [ Bell dinging ] - Japanese. - [ Speaks Filipino ] We can't leave without Corbett. [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Music playing ] [ Ducks quacking ] [ Engines rumbling ] YAMATA: [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Music playing ] Corbett! Corbett, are you in there? [ Music playing ] [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] - [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Indistinct chatter ] JOAN: Answer me, Corbett! Corbett! Corbett? [ Music playing ] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. [ Music playing ] Fantine! Get him out. [ Speaks Filipino ] CORBETT: Hey, good job. All right, all right, good job, sir. JOAN: Get him over to the well. CORBETT: All right. All right. The captain... [ Ducks quacking ] CORBETT: Wait, wait, wait, wait. - [ Splashing ] - [ Grunting ] Get him on the carabao. [ Laughing ] I'll shoot number two! Kid Corbett! Whoa, whoa! [ Music playing ] [ Engines rumbling ] CORPUS: I'm Corpus, the mayor of this town. May I help you? We know that there are high American officers in this area. CORPUS: There are no Americans in this village. Are you sure? Yes. [ Gunshots ] - [ Speaks Japanese ] - [ Slap ] [ Speaks Japanese ] CORBETT: Whoa, whoa, horse, whoa. Come on, come on. Whoa. [ Music playing ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Music playing ] CORBETT: Wait a minute. Hey, wait. How about timeout for a recess? MAN: We'll go until dark, then rest for the night. [ Music playing ] [ Fire crackling ] Well... nothing like a nice friendly little campfire. If you're coming up for food, you're gonna have to scrounge for yourself because we're all out. Couldn't care less. - How's your head? - I don't know. You haven't seen it anywhere, have you? You sure do cave into temptation, don't you? Well, I give my best shot, I try. Well, start trying not to, for a change. You almost ruined this whole mission. Thank God, there's not gonna be anything stronger from here on out than coconut milk and nothing more enticing than a nice, soft monkey. Let me see that tomorrow. [ Music playing ] You're either selling yourself short, or you're being coy, which is it? What? There's an enticement two feet away from me, who's trying to act like a top sergeant. [ Scoffs ] I do not act... I said "try". You can't cut it, you give yourself away every time. Please, can't we call a truce? - Just for the rest...? - All right, all right. Truce, truce. Send up a white flag. - All right? - Right. Well, I'll tell you something, sweetheart. We've barely been out of each other's sight for four days. We've eaten together, laughed together, killed together, slept together, in a manner of speaking. In a situation like that, you know, now you had to figure that we'd either be friends or lovers, right? Friends or lovers? Where did you ever get such an idea? Well, I cased the chemical elements. Lady, you ain't a man's best friend. So you know what that leaves? Zero. That's what that leaves. Zero. Hell, it does. [ Scoffs ] You seem to naturally assume that kind of relationship with all... I didn't assume those looks. I didn't assume those touches. You think I've been encouraging you? You don't remember your hand underneath my head on the truck, what was that? Why don't we just lay our cards on the table? Everything above board. Friends, I've got plenty of friends. You're gonna be doing that a lot. You're our way to get that gold, and that's all. You're just another hotshot to me, and that does mean zero. Two hotshot husbands and two very cold divorces have taught me that much. Two divorces? [ Chuckling ] Man, you are full of surprises, ain't you? You bet your sweet cheeks, I am. And a third on the hoof. Seems I'm not the only one caving into temptation. Marriage is no temptation, Mr. Corbett. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Well, I mean, marriage... I know what you mean. You mean there's nothing tempting about a husband. Otherwise, you wouldn't be willing to get yourself damn near killed getting away from number three. Where'd you ever get such an idea? I'm not trying to get away from my husband. Then, where is he? Why aren't you with him? I'm not with him because I'm going to him. He's in Mamburao. He's been running the mission ever since my father's death. [ Sighing ] Is that all of your surprises? I mean, are you finished? You know, you kind of knocked me off balance for a minute back there when you said you were married, right? That's a pretty good curve. Why? Because you're hopelessly enthralled with my sweet nature? No, no, it's just that... Well, you're the only broad available for this trip. When you got stressed, I... [ Chuckles ] I was worried those soft monkeys would start looking good to me. [ Laughing ] [ Music playing ] [ Indistinct chatter ] That's Mamburao. [ Music playing ] Well, sweet cheeks, are you sure these people are neighborly? Still got a river between us. Mosquitoes must be working for the Balangas. [ Bird crying ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Bird hooting ] [ Music playing ] CORBETT: Santos, these carabaos are more trouble than they're worth, we'd make better time without 'em. SANTOS: Yes, you're right. [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Music playing ] CORBETT: Say, what is that thing? JOAN: Oh, it's a charm the Balangas gave me when I helped them through a sickness. It's supposed to keep away evil spirits. [ Speaks Japanese ] Mamburao? - [ Speaks Japanese ] - [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Music playing ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Music playing ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Birds chirping ] JOAN: Wait a minute. This way. [ Music playing ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Launching blowgun dart ] [ Yelling ] [ Splashing ] CORBETT: Get down! Wait a minute, don't fire. Stay low. [ Birds chirping ] Wait a minute! [ Speaks Tagalog ] [ Indistinct chatter ] JOAN: [ Speaks Tagalog ] MAN: [ Speaks Tagalog ] JOAN: [ Speaks Tagalog ] MAN: [ Speaks Tagalog ] MAN: [ Speaks Tagalog ] They've sent some men out for bangkas, boats. They've also sent some more men out to set some traps that will kill. Oh, God, sometimes I wonder if that gold is really worth all the death it's caused. You got to believe it is or you'd go crazy. You know, I believe you're right. I believe it is for the buck. Why are so many people willing to die for it? I've delivered babies, operated, vaccinated, when everything else failed, I prayed. Dad and I have lived in these islands for 10 years, trying to save lives. Why? So they could be bombed, strafed, and shot for the buck. You're not responsible for that. Then, who is? Let them be here, not the innocents. You're forgetting what you said. Without that gold, there may not be a Philippines. Oh, I love these islands and these people. I want you. [ Music playing ] CORBETT: I want you on that plane with me. We could find an island. [ Music playing ] [ Water crashing ] [ Grunts ] [ Music playing ] CORBETT: Well, that's the end of the trail. JOAN: Not quite. Below here, the Balangas have a ladder that leads down to the river. Two miles down that river is the mission. Well, let's move it. [ Music playing ] [ Birds chirping ] I'll go first. [ Grunts ] Francisco, hurry! [ Grunts ] [ Screams ] [ Explosion ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Music playing ] [ Speaks Filipino ] CORBETT: Move it. [ Music playing ] [ Speaks Japanese ] [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshots continue ] [ Music playing ] [ Groans ] [ Gunshots ] [ Groans ] [ Gunshots ] CORBETT: My God. Joan! Faster! [ Music playing ] [ Groans ] [ Music playing ] - [ Blowgun firing dart ] - [ Groans ] [ Birds chirping ] - [ Blowgun firing dart ] - [ Groans ] [ Music playing ] MAN: [ Speaks Filipino ] CORBETT: Easy. Easy! CORBETT: We need a doctor! I'm a doctor. DR. REYES: [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Indistinct chatter ] DR. REYES: [ Speaks Filipino ] She was hit by a Jap bullet about two miles upriver. You're Corbett? That's right. I'm Dr. Reyes. - You're her husband? - DR. REYES: No. Her husband was killed two days ago by the Japanese. Underground radio, you were coming. The airplane is almost ready. Yeah. Let's go. [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Music playing ] We're gonna have to rig the bombs on the wings. [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] - Yeah, yeah. - [ Speaks Filipino ] Yeah. [ Chuckling ] [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Speaks Filipino ] [ Music playing ] She's been asking for you. MAN: Dr. Reyes... The radio! [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Music playing ] You're gonna lay around that sack all day? Will the airplane work? CORBETT: It'll do just fine. Dr. Reyes is a good mechanic. There's enough gasoline to get to the safest island? It's gonna be one... hell of a lonely island without you, sweet cheeks. For a little while. I appreciate that, Chip. Another time, another place, We could've had it all. [ Coughs ] Crazy bastard. Sink that barge. [ Music playing ] SANTOS: Corbett, Corregidor has fallen. We must leave right away. Not we, I'm going alone. Col. Turner said someone has to go with you. If this doesn't work out, there's no sense in two of us getting killed. - Yeah, but... - There's nothing, absolutely nothing that you can do to help with it. Well, I'm sorry. He said someone has to go with you. Well, damn it, I'm sorry, too. [ Punch landing ] [ Music playing ] [ Plane engine starting ] [ Plane engine revving ] [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Plane engine rumbling ] [ Music playing ] Man, this is gonna be harder to beat than four of a kind. [ Music playing ] [ Plane engines rumbling ] Go, baby. [ Explosion ] Nothin' to it. Except people get killed. [ Music playing ] [ Plane engines rumbling ] [ Gunshots ]
