Says who? Says Spike. Spike needs a place to grow up. Yeah, he ain't complaining, are you Spike? Besides, I've been to plenty of cities... And they ain't nothing but trouble. Just get out there and hire somebody. Mr. McBride would like to see you. And... you. Come with me. I've been coming here everyday for two weeks, How come I can't get a job? Ain't none. Bullshit. I've seen you hire other guys, I'm a good worker. Well, the way I figure is, you're the early bird. That didn't get the worm. Come on, give me one, give me one, come on, Let me see one, I just want to see if it's my style. Georgia, Georgia, get the truck. You're gonna need these clothes, sweetheart. Come on, we're leaving.

To the city, like you wanted. Citizens of Rain City, enlist in the militia. Defense is everyone's business. Join the militia now. Hey Wanda, how about some more coffee? Coming right up. Didn't eat again? I don't feel good. I'll get you some Lupo. Lupo. Yeah. To me too. You too, you too. Thank you. Hey, Solo, here is your egg. You're quick. Hey, Wanda. Hi there. Beautiful this morning. Slept in late. Looks it. I love you! Well, that's good. Yeah. Thank you. So, where are they now, did they get together? Yeah, I guess eventually. Eventually, that's good. Where is the baggage? Big bag of clothes. This is not my day. Wanda, Wanda, I got some more love letters for you. Thanks, Nate. Hawk. Is it really you? What do you think? There's a view, at least. Not too bad. And I've got furniture and stuff in the garage... I guess anything is better than what you're used to. That's not what I meant. I know what you meant. What's this? A piano. I know how you feel. A lot's happened. But we've been friends for a long time. And I want us to stay that way. I'll get Marty to help move that stuff. Thanks. It's really nice. Well, you got to be nice to your friends, Wanda, Without 'em you're a total stranger. Yes, ma'am, Look, I can't help you right now, okay? No ma'am, I didn't mean you. Yeah, can I help you? Long time, Hawkins. 2,842 days. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but I think we ought to keep. On the surveillance little longer. Yeah. Let me call you back. You look terrific, Hawk. You look like shit, Gunther. What the hell happened to you? Some guy dropped 200 pounds on my knee. He said I arrested him once. You wouldn't recognize him now. Hawk, you understand why none of us. Could attend the trial. You know the policy. Hey, I know. It's okay, you didn't miss much. I said I'm guilty and everybody agreed. I want a job, Gunther. Shit, John, come on. I was your best. Johnny. I don't want to hear fuck all about policy either. I can do things you can't do on the outside. Public service. You dumb son of a bitch, that's what got you in trouble. In the first place. Gunther, you know, I could help you, And you know if I play for the other guys I could hurt you bad. Was that supposed to be, a fucking threat? Hilly Blue's sending Rambo around seeing me tomorrow, They want to talk. Hawk, how can you be that dumb? Stay away from that evil shit. Little bit of everybody belongs in hell, Lieutenant. I love your face. I love you. I found a breather. I must get closer. No guns, no knife. I can smell his breath, cold rice and fish, Now dropped glove, splash, No more breathing, Except my own feverish gasping. I'll take the ride here and wrap it in wet leaves. Wanda stands there as beautiful as ever, I used to dream about being near someone. Like her while I was in the jungle. Strained to remember the smell of perfume. Now I'm here, I don't care. There you go. You feeling good? You think Wanda's into dames? Is that what you wanted to talk about Rambo? I'm here for one thing, Hawk, Hilly Blue recognized you as a man of talent. Hilly wants to put that talent to use before it spoils. That's two things. It's been charming, Hawk, but I got to run. Don't blow it, Guys like you get maybe one more chance, If that. Strange thing about being around people again... Is all I seem to want is their smell, not their company, Not their loves or losses. Hilly Blue! Hey, Rambo, you forgot the check. You keep the change. Let's go inside. Yeah. A five's worth of bacon and eggs. How about you, honey, how much you've got? For both of us. You know him? Never met him but I know him. Honey, use my office for that. Yeah, okay. Been here before? No, I've never been nowhere. Ask me anything, I've been everywhere. And then there are the innocents, The babies with babies in their arms, The babies who've forgotten how to dream. The ancient dreams, the dreams of trees, And not because they're too young. Because they've been introduced to greed, Greed, like fire, transforms. Well, I'm not greedy, I just want to make some money. I might know something for tonight. How much? 50. I mean big. You're impatient? When I do something I do it. One thing leads to another. Where? Here, at 7:00. I'll drive. Be on time. Cervantes says, delay always breeds danger. Well, who is that, is he coming with us? Only in spirit. No guns, I don't do that kind of job. Is what I'm wearing all right? Good. His crates, motorcycle. Motorcycle parts. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can read. And Korean watches with Swiss names on 'em. What? Give me a 50, and I'll buy you some time. Right. I'm want to say something, Johnny, I never got a chance to say. I understood why you did what you did. No mystery to it. He was evil. I'm sorry... You had to pay for it. Let's not talk about it, okay? Johnny, I know, I know you want a woman now, I'm not the one. Do you hear me? I need you to. So do I. Damn you! Listen to me, only a few things. Will ever be good again. For old times, let me see if this is one of 'em. Stand still. What's the matter, you're nervous? There's the man. Hey, Solo. How is it going? All right. Let's hurry. I've never done this before. Don't worry, everything's gonna be fine. Corner crate. Watches are in the bottom. Take only two now. Give me the 100. Yeah, sure. Take the whole box. Bullshit, man. What's the matter, nervous? Tell me you had a good time, Wanda. Go to hell. It's okay to admit it. Don't bet on it. And don't try it again, okay? I'll give you this room, rent free, Now that I can do for old times, New times, any fucking time at all. But don't ever cross that line again, Hawk. What I got's mine, private. Come on Wanda, Don't tell me you don't ever get hungry. Got nothing to do with hunger, thick head, It's a matter of philosophy. Well, you can't live on philosophy. Just get smart. Hi. Jesus, honey, you need a bath. He likes you. I was the type of kid my mama told me not to play with. Don't you have a stroller. Or a playpen, stuff like that for him? We can't afford that. But I do plan on getting a job. So that I can buy things for him. Yeah? Ever waitress? Citizens of Rain City, enlist in the militia. Defense is everyone's business. Georgia? You're drinking on the job, Solo. Don't worry about it. You're fucking up the operation. Don't worry about it, it's going to be hot. And you come stumbling in here with this jitterbug? It's going to be real hot now, Everything is going to be fine. Where have you been? I just had to make a stop, that's all, yeah. And who is this sleaze? This is just a young sapling. Who needs some pruning that's all. Hey! You seen that girl I was with? He's going to be pruned. She's in my office and my name is not "Hey." Believe me, believe me! Georgia, thought I told you to wait in the camper. Wanda has offered me a job four mornings a week. What, wait a minute, just. He's waiting. I'll be right there. I can buy stuff for Spike. You let me worry about buying stuff for Spike, look. Wow. You like it. Where did you get this? Part of a real good deal I'm into. Look, we'll talk about it later. I don't like it, Solo, it's no deal. Why? Why? I'll be just be in a minute. It's the same money, Same stuff, the same deal, just as clean. It's not like it used to be, Solo, Sometimes you got to change. You and me, just you and me, So we got a new partner, so what? Okay, what's. That motorcycle boeing. Motorcycle boeing? Say, we cantalk a deal. Under the crane. You got it, midnight. Good. Let's walk. What the hell are you looking at? I was looking at her. She's my woman. Listen, don't nothing surprise me anymore. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Come on, Coop, nothing happened. Ain't nothing gonna, either. You get my message, I know you do. Come on, Coop. Don't forget. Yeah. Where are you going? I'll be back late, angel. You stay in here. I rigged up the antenna. One, two, three, four, Four-fifty, five. You keep beating Hilly's prices. And I can run jewelry eight days a week. Don't you worry. Who is Hilly? Hilly Blue, first estate. Hilly is trying to squeeze out independents like us. But you keep on cutting his prices, And I will guarantee you a lock in a hurry. Only one. You don't want to eat that shit too fast. See ya. ♪ Trouble in mind. Who the fuck are you looking at? Are you a cop? You know god damn well I ain't a cop. That's what I'm looking at then, a woman who ain't a cop. What's the damage? I've been telling you, I been looking on here, It's gotta be there. Wait. There is nobody here but I'm sorry about that. Members only. Members? I thought I was a member. Welcome to the club, member. Let me get a word in edgewise. I don't want it. No. There's nothing to say. Why don't you find yourself a seat? Okay. Wait. And when I drink, I hate you. Read my lips. Excuse me, excuse me. This is how it's done. I don't care, which is exasperating for me, you know. How am I supposed to know? I don't want to know! Forget it. Even if they handed that stuff over to us, Going against Hilly Blue just ain't safe. Yeah, the best stuff never is. You are driving me crazy. I'm sorry, you know, I tried to ask you as nicely as I can. Why can't we talk about it? Stop it already, you're asking all the damn time. Well, I want. If I was going... What's your problem, buddy? All right, let's have it. Let's have it all! Let's go, let's have it! Shit! What the hell are you doing? I don't know! Why don't you get in the car? Gimme the coat. They're getting away with all that stuff! What the hell is wrong with you?! Let's get out of here, need a change of pace. Where do you want to go? My place. You'd like it there. It's pink. I'll bet. It's cozy. Bloody instructions, not returns. You prick! The inventor. You know what you're doing? Yeah. Not too short. Look at this money you're all so fascinated about. I don't understand it, it's all full of germs. Don't know where it's been. Don't know where it's been. Not only that. We all love it, don't we? Money? Let's go someplace a little more interesting. Is something wrong, do you want me to take this? It's perfect. I don't know if I know what I'm doing. I'd say you're off to a very good start, honey. Here is one on sale, 42.50. I only have 35. I'll tell you what, I'll cover the 7.50 personally. Can you just step back here a moment? Sure. Here, yeah, right there. Okay. Right, I just want to seal the deal. Seal the deal? Yeah, right. But. Bye. Hi, darling. What's the matter with you? Where have you been, Coop? What have you done to your hair? What? Don't bug me. I got a big deal tonight and I need rest, So just lay off. Hey, Spike... God, what a night. Coop... Georgia, what are you doing! What's the matter with you? You don't love us, Coop. Look, I got important business tonight, okay? Well, don't you bother coming back. You're the one always nagging about wanting. Something better, not me. Why are you doing this? Doing what Georgia? You know, you push me, but you don't like where I go. Where are you going? I need to sleep! It's me, the guy from upstairs. Hey listen, I got tired of scrambled eggs and sausage, I thought I'd go out tonight. I thought you might like to come along. Bring the kid, we'll make a night of it. What do you say? Hey, I know you're in there, I ain't going to hurt you. It seems like you've been hurt enough for one night. It gets pretty dangerous out here alone at night. This is a rough neighborhood. You're lucky I'm a civilized man. Come on, it's cold and wet out here. We'll go to this real nice place I know. I wouldn't say it's expensive. But you need a co-signer for a ham sandwich. That was a joke. I think you ought to know I can sit here a long time. Talking to you without seeing your face. Where I just come from, That's the only way some guys. Can get it out at all. Georgia, turn around. I want to go back. See, I can see your face anyway, Right in front of me. The way it changes. I feel like I can see your face right now. You look real scared. The reason I come by was that I thought. We might have something in common like... We can talk about it over dinner. Better go away. Listen, if I go away. It's going to hurt you more than me. I'm going to the best steakhouses in town. I bet you hadn't been out since you've been here. Come on, take your mind off that shithead. You're living with. Don't you be talking about Coop like that! No, I'm not going to go out to dinner with you. Why would I want to go out to dinner with you? Now, the baby is crying. Just go home. I am home. Georgia. Wrong man at the right time don't mean shit, pal. What the fuck are you doing here? Hey, don't push it. Son of a bitch. Hey, hey. What the hell is going on? Where are you going, what's the matter with you? Give me the keys to your car. Now, why are you starting trouble? Give me the goddamn keys, okay? Okay. Come on, you'll feel better once you see the man's money. Yeah, right. A grand. I can't. It's worth three times that. What's the matter, things getting fuzzy? It ain't the price. What is it? I just can't. Why can't you? Hilly found out about the watches. He sent some boys around. Life is too short. You want to move that shit, You got to talk to Hilly. No, no, no, hold it, come on, come on, come on. Now there is a couple of things we can do. I just want some god damn money, I don't care who gives it to me. Yeah, well, I was afraid you'd say that. You don't want a partner, just give me my share, I'll run it. Hey, did I say anything? So, what did you do to that poor girl? Nothing. What? Nothing, damn it, just talking. Bullshit. What the hell are you saying? What's the matter with you? You can't be trusted no more. Yeah, that's it, that's what happens. Lighten up, Wanda. Come on, give her a chance. She's got too much ahead of her. Too many good times. She don't want to hate anybody yet. Probably never will. If someone doesn't break her heart. Don't do it again. Just let me know if she gets here, okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, so she can. Whack you on the head with a frying pan again. Whatever you're going through, you're not an animal. You know what the hell you are. So start behaving. I don't know, Wanda, it don't make much sense. While I was gone, everything was changin'. And maybe I shouldn't have never come back. Maybe it's all fate or something. All I know is it doesn't make any goddamn sense. And now I'm an animal. Fine, no problem. Johnny. No problem, Wanda. Yeah, Rambo, I know where it is, yeah. Well, same to you, Rambo. Thanks. Asshole. You were adjusted on the sides here. You know, that's really ugly. So, all set, 6 o'clock, do you hear me? Yeah. I'm gonna go to Wanda's first. Bullshit, you got to be sharp. I just want to get Georgia some flowers. Flowers? After the deal, you can buy her some flowers, You can get her an whole stinking bush. Man, you don't understand women at all. I mean, I've been a real jerk. Hey, I know there is only two ways to handle a woman, And both ways are wrong. Come on, let's get a drink. What about the mountains? Maybe next year. My god, Carl. What? Somebody has left a baby in the car. What? ♪ Trouble in mind. ♪ I'm blue. ♪ My poor heart is beating slow ♪ ♪ I never had no trouble. Are you all right dear? Spike? ♪ In my life before. ♪ Never had no trouble. ♪ In my life before. Spike! No, no! No, where's Spike? All right, go to sleep! You're late. Come on in. Come on. Sit down. You got something for me. Your boy was very, very bad going to see Leo first. 300. What? No way. Maybe next time we can be more generous. There ain't going to be any next time. Unless you give us 800 now. What do you say about that, Solo? What's the matter, you gone deaf? Sorry, I'm not authorized to go over 300. Maybe we should talk to somebody who is. So, you're the naughty boys who are trying to disrupt. Years of harmonious trade. They don't look especially tough to me, Rambo... Impatient perhaps, but certainly not tough. When their ship comes in, There is going to be a dock strike. It's strange, most people imagine me. To be very patient person whereas I'm just the opposite. The very moment I want something I have to have it. Nothing ever satisfies me. Everything comes too late. Too late for me and I get eaten up inside. When it is going to happen, when, when? Takes all the fun out of the bracelet. When you have to buy it yourself. Well, pay them 300 Rambo and be done with it. We ain't taking 300. You know why? Clue me. Because our next job is going to be big, Real big, worth 20 times as much. The best there is. Miracles happen when you surrender. The trick is surrendering on your own terms. Here comes my impatience all over again. All right, I'll pay you 500 for these trifles right now. But then this big deal will start clean, no prejudice. I'll be fair and so will you. Otherwise I'll have your lungs filled with water. Pay them Rambo and offer them dinner. Hey, Johnny, you got to come downstairs right now. Well, if it ain't the old philosopher. She is back and she's got trouble. I'll just be in my office honey. I'll be right back. If a man looked at a woman's mouth before her eyes, He'd get fooled a lot less. I can have your baby back in about 6 hours. If I get on it, but it will cost you. Mister, I don't have no money. But I'll do anything to get my baby back safe. God. That's fair enough. That's too much for a ring. Yeah, more noodles. What? Missing male, five months, taken from community mall, In a red convertible. What the hell is this, Hawk? Put it on the computer, top priority. It's part of that favor you owe me. Now? Now. Now. What took you so long? We went bowling, come here. Want to see your momma? I'd like to be back with my baby in an hour or so, If that's okay with you. What's this? It's a cake. Sure could fix this place up. How long you been with that guy? Four years. Why? Why? We were attracted I guess. Where? Our. Coop's from the north. And he's been to lot of places. He's real good with Spike and stuff. Well, he shouldn't leave you alone, does he do it often? Sometimes, not that much. Mister, you found my baby, You saved me from the worst thing. That ever could have happened to me. Coop's always telling me, nobody get saved. I was saved because of you. That's me. That's Hawk. Are you scared? No. Why not? Because I know you don't mean to harm me. You don't know about me. Wanda says that you were a policeman. What else? Prison. For killing a man, did she tell you that too? Your friend is right. Nobody gets saved. No, I'm sure whatever you did, you did for a good reason. Because you're a brave man. Get out of here. Tomorrow night, you and I are going to dinner. If Coop tries to stop us, I'm going to break his neck. You don't have to hurt Coop. Because I'm not going to let you. Is that right? And there is something else. Going out to dinner with you. Is something I just might want to do. Hi, Spikey. Spikey. Well, what happened? Nothing. Nothing? Yeah. Except he asked me to dinner tomorrow night. You mean, like a real date? And what did you do? Said I'd look forward to it. That's good. Just take it to your garage, I don't want it around. Can I get your signature? Yeah. Hawk, hold him. Just a sec. Thank you. Wanda... what's going on? Some stupid city regulation, cost you 100 to bail it out. Don't worry, you can stay with me. What are you thinking? I got a plan. Yeah, well, I think we got to plan a lot more. And do a lot less. Somebody's got what we want, we'll take it from him. Great. Then we make Hilly Blue pay top money for it. Trouble. You heard me. No way. Wanda, I've packed it so I guess I'll just take it downstairs. That's good, honey. Be careful with my magic man. I wouldn't mind a big one myself.! Hey, Wanda? Where is my goddamn camper? City took it away. Shit. Where is Georgia? Georgia, shopping maybe, movie. Life goes on. Yes so I couldn't believe Trixi gave it to me, But I think that she and Nurego. Had a fight that day. And so then she traded with me. 'Cause she just want to get rid of everything. Boy, what a dress she gave me, though. She wanted to get rid of everything and she gave me this. And I think it's just probably the best thing I have ever seen don't you think? Yeah. You look beautiful. Do you think he is going to like it? He is going to like it, all right. Big deal, so she's not there. Wanda is probably taking care of her. Look, we are not dressed like this for nothing, are we? No. Nice tie. ♪ Love isn't found in poetry or a fleeting glance ♪ ♪ True love is only found down in your pants ♪ ♪ Love is not a fanciful...

Yeah, nothing is too expensive for my little girl. How much did it cost? I don't know, ten, twenty, I forget. Skinny, I thought I told you. Thanks. She'd like some more milk, too. Sure. What did he say to you? I don't know. They got some weird waiters around here. That's the biggie, angel, wait till you see there. Is that something? That looks expensive. That should look expensive. Thank you for visiting Rain City's tallest restaurant. I'd like to tell you a few facts here on the way down. We never lived in the city. I always wanted to come because I always thought. Everything was just going. To work out perfect in the city. I guess it's never as good as you thought it's going to be. Or as bad as they say. I don't know, I grew up right over there. And I'm going to die somewhere else. Die? What are you talking about dying? I thought you just said you were feeling good. I feel better right now than I ever felt in my life, Which is probably what made me think about dying. Why? When you get older, you think about dying... And not dying in the wrong place at the wrong time. Maybe I will go across the river when it is my time. Follow my destiny. Here you go. Keep the whole change. Look at my sweet baby princess. Did you like your party? I did. It was thrilling! It was thrilling. That is so beautiful. You precious little hummingbird. Edward, don't turn around, you won't get hurt. Gentleman, please. I can tell you this, you are making a big mistake. Shut up. Shut up. I understand of course, we will not resist, But you are still making a big mistake. Open the door. I can't see. Where are you going? I don't know. What do we do? We just got to get rid of 'em, that's all. Please! No violence. No, we are just going to put you somewhere. How about upstairs? No. Gentlemen, if I may, there is a closet over there. Good, good. My house is yours, take what you will. Get in. I don't care what happens to me. I ask only one thing, please, gentlemen, Don't harm my bride. What am I doing? Let's go, hurry up! Give it to me! Cooperate! Just give it up. My darling! Please! Don't move for 15 seconds. 15 minutes. Minutes. Should we look around? No, this is great, this is plenty. Jesus Christ! Scum!!!! Kill 'em! Kill 'em! Blow their heads off! Get my presents back. Shit! The old man is crazy! You are dead meat, punks! Hey, look at me. Wanda. Hold your horses, its coming. Here, honey. You take it to him. Can't you? No. You go. Now. What the hell is this? What you ordered. Bullshit. Goddamn it, Wanda, you know how I like it. Yeah well bring it back we will try again. Okay, Hawk, that will do. It's okay Wanda, I got it. He's like a wounded bear, Now what the hell did you do to him last night? Nothin'. I didn't do nothin'. Well, maybe you should have. Wanda. How do you know him? I mean the first time. You ever laid eyes on him. He saved my ass. Literally. Do you love him? Yeah. But not the way you think. What about that man that he killed? Now who told you about that? I heard about it. Fat Adolph. Fat what? If it was evil, he was into it. Probably made dice out of his mother's knuckle bones. Johnny was eaten up by it. He is obsessed with it. One day at the race track... He walks up to him... And he shoots him right between the eyes. State threw the book at him because he was a cop. Some guy even got elected because of it. Be nice to him. Shit. Georgia. Coop. Where the hell have you been? I have been looking all over for you. I came over here, the camper was gone, Wanda said you were out shopping. Hey, what do you think? Great? Look what I got. Wow! Where did you get that? Only the beginning. And that. Another week I'll get you anything you want. Come on, I gotta go over to Cambridge. No! Come on. The sky's the limit. No, Coop. I don't like the way you are. Nah, I'm not in this one. This is between y'all. You're dead dirt! No, no, Hawk, don't hurt him anymore. I amon my knees! For the damage. What damage? You're dead dirt. Hey! It's against the law to drink in public. You should know that, Hawk. Gettin' a little exercise, Hawk? What do you want Rambo? Quick. I want to invite you to a party at Hilly's, Saturday. Booze, broads, big shots your kind of thing. Never fancy, but... wear something safe. Why? Last night a couple of hoods hit Nathanson and his old lady. Took some shit, roughed 'em up. Nate thinks Hilly did it. Hilly wants to clear it up fast. So? So... in case. Here, Hilly, in case. Mr. Adolph. Mr. Adolph. For Wanda. Gracias. Okay, we got you. Come on, buddy, you can't sleep here. Come on here. Well, what are you going to do? About what? About what? About your fuckin' life, pal. Well, I could quit. Put it away. A personal loan. Go somewhere, get away from this shit. What shit is that? Wanda's, Hilly Blue's, the shit you're wallowing in. Hawk, you are headed for real trouble. And I won't be able to help you. Well, that's okay Gunther. 'Cause if I ever need a helping hand... I know right where to find it, don't I? I'll show it to Hilly. We'll be in touch. It's just a sample. There's a ton more. Where that came from, and we're in a hurry. Well, I will say this for you. When you decide to be a jerk you really do it well. Where is she? She's gone... for good. Unless it don't work out with the punk. She went to see him. Went to Cambridge. You should get away too. Start over someplace else. Okay, you come with me? I might. Except you're in love... with her. I am? Yeah. How would you know about that? Well, thank God love is blind, otherwise it see too much. You and her... You're missing so much. Shit, between the two of you there's almost a whole person. That feels sogood. Just bend over, that's all. Good. Just shut up and bend over, that's all. Come in. Come on in! It's a party. Hello. Shit. Who is that? What's going on? Whatever. Georgia. Don't touch me. What are you doing with yourself, Coop? Aren't you sorry, Coop? Sorry? Georgia wait a minute. Let's go someplace and talk. Things are good now. They are only going to get better. You can't even see what's happened. Can you?! Why did you follow me tonight? Thought you needed following. You are always helping me out. Well, you need more help than most. What if I wanted you to help me out with something else, Would you do it? Name it. What if I wanted you to help me out with Coop, would you? You went to him and he didn't want you, so let it go. He is going to do something bad, I just know it. He probably already has. Look, if I could help him myself, I swear I would. What the hell am I supposed to do? Sit him down on my knee and tell him. What a big mistake he is making? Yeah. You could talk to him. What do you think I am, Georgia? I think you're a good man who's had bad luck. And I think all that can change. The luck, I mean. Okay. Listen to me. I'll help you out. I'll see that poor son of a bitch. But you owe me something I want. And I just spent too many years. Wanting and wanting and never havin'. So once I've fix this up and sent him on his way, You belong to me, completely. You'll live with me. And I will take care of you. And the kid and we'll have something. Otherwise, let him get what he deserves. Let everybody get what they deserve. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I want to talk to you. Who is this? It's John Hawkins. I whipped your ass yesterday. Remember? Fuck you, asshole. I'm going to fuckin' blow your ass away, chump. It's me. Didn't want to miss Rambo's call. I just talked to him. Hilly wants the rest delivered to the estate, Black sector 1, He even gave me his phone number. But I don't think we should be hauling this shit all over town. Tell him to meet us at your place in an hour. With the cash or no deal. Good idea. Get your ass over here. And pack something and knock three times and say boo-chee. Boo-chee? Boo-chee. Yeah, okay. Hey, just a minute. I just want to talk. It's your lucky day, chump. Get to postpone your funeral. Shit! Hey. Well, Hawk, two witnesses saw you leave the scene. And described Wanda's car. I thought you came by to bring my pension check. We both know Hilly Blue's signature. Just another friendly execution. Fine, they should all blow each other's balls off. Make my life easier. Where do you fit in? I was following some guy on personal business. Hawk, I'll bounce your ass, don't think I won't. Well, I've been there, remember? Get out of my way. Stay away from that guy you've been following. Hilly's boys will get there first, And I don't want you within 10 miles of the corpse. You read me? Ciao, baby. Well, there was nothing in the house to eat, And so I got some groceries with Wanda's money, And Spike's upstairs with Wanda now, and... Did that man say something about a corpse? No. Are you in trouble? Does it have something to do with Coop? God, you feel good. So do you. I mean, really, down deep. Just watching you carry those groceries in... Feels like home. Home... I like that. Shit. Goddamn city. I don't know what I'm doing here. I know what I'm gonnado. Go to that pig's house and get what's mine. That's what I'm going to do. Whether it is or not. Hawkins. Hawkins. Hawkins? Right. Park at the top of the hill. Hello. Park it right over there. Class up the joint. You bet, sir. Dip your ash? Yeah, I'll call it Rambo's private dance palace. Hawk, what an honor. Contain yourself. Let's go talk to Hilly. I got to say showing up tonight. Show's a lot of the right spirit. I thought you said Hilly and Nate Nathanson were on the outs. Hilly is trying to patch things up. By inviting Nate's whole army? If Nate gets invited, he brings the army. Don't worry, any trouble my guys know exactly who to point at. Yeah, yeah, come on, you look out. It's really quite simple, Nate. That's what I meant. Hey Hilly. Look what I found. Everybody. Meet John Hawkins, Johnny the Hawk, A legend in these parts, slayer of Fat Adolph. What are you doing here, Hawk? Invited, Nate. The same as you. John is going to work for me now. Figures. Baby, let's have another drink. Come on, cupcake. Out of my way, cyclops. Easy on the sauce, cupcake. This is serious. Everything between me and Nate is desolation, sadness, Disappointment after disappointment. Hilly, are you serving the fish tonight? So, John, how is your love life? The prince kisses an angel in the beginning, But in the end, it's always a bald-headed slob. Yawning over a bloated hag. Maybe it's the middle that matters. Don't challenge me, John. I know the subject. I learned it from my mother. She didn't love me one bit. She never showed me any affection. She never even kissed me once, Had to put over her misery. Women are despicable, especially mothers. The way I figure it, God was smiling the day he dreamed up my mama. Disgusting. Will you shut up? Let's go to my study. Hilly, Hilly, I know. Lamb chops. Guess it won'tbe lamp chops. You know, not long ago, I thought about committing suicide again. From time to time it gets to me. But then I think about how I didn't kill myself the other times. So I go to sleep for several days. When I wake up, I'm famished, A sure sign of good health. And good health is essential. Isn't it, John? John? Yeah. Come on down here. You must always pay attention when I speak, Especially when I'm discussing health and death. Now about your health. Ain't my health I want to talk about, Hilly. Death, is it? Everyone wants to go to heaven, But no one wants to die. Let me get you a drink. Your boys put the anchor on a guy yesterday. Dead weight finds its own level. The stiff don't concern me, Hilly. Of course it does. You're capable of almost anything, John. But mainly anything bad. You have nothing but bad qualities. And yet, you think you have a heart. We ain't discussin' my heart either. Nonsense. That's all we've been discussing this evening. People who say they care about other people are hypocrites. I prefer a priest. They at least are realhypocrites. I prefer two-faced people who show it. Leave the other guy alone, Hilly. The stiff's partner. You're so predictable. You make me want to vomit. The only way you can ever live up to this ideal. You have of yourself is from a hole in the ground. You got what you were after, Which I figure to be Nate's stuff, right? You miserable loser. How dare you interfere with my business? I'm telling you to let him go, Hilly. You're telling me. Now let me tell you. The late partner and the soon-to-be late partner... And even now, after I return Nate's property. As a goodwill gesture, he refuses to believe. That I had nothing to do with the robbery. And I need Nate to believe in me, or it just gets ugly. Everything about you is ugly, Hilly. What's a little more going to matter? This is too good. Both of you at once. I want your money, Hilly. I want your head. Start with the wallet. Slow. Now take out the dough. Goddamn it! Hilly!!! This is war!!! Sonja! Where's my bride?! Hilly!!! Get out of here. I gotta talk to you. Don't argue with me, goddamn it I want to ask you something. Did you sleep with her? Get out of here. You did, didn't you? Son of a bitch. H-Hilly. Sonja! Crap. My darling. I am a dead man. Everything will be yours now. Nate, no! The homes, servants... the yacht. The yacht? Citizens of Rain City, enlist in the militia. Defense is everyone's business. Join the militia... Coop! Don't shut me out. Georgia, I want to talk to you. I want to make everything okay. Everything is okay, Coop. I missed you. Driving over here in a fog and the sun and everything... I miss the hell out of you. You and Spike. You can't be in love with him. Goodbye, Coop. I'm gonna come back in a few days. I don't think so. You can't keep me away. I've changed Georgia, I'll show you. I've learned something. Him and me feels safe together, Coop.
