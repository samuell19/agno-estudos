I need you to bring it back to spot. - I got you, no doubt. I got you. - No. No! No! We got a problem. The money is not there. - What'd you mean it's not there? - Mia, I put it in the hottest spot and then when I went to go get it, it's not there. - What'd I told you about raising your voice up in my house? - Look, Wesley, I'm so sorry... (glass shattering) - Drop the fucking attitude. (slaps) - I said, what the fuck you gonna do about my money? - Yo Zab, what's up, I didn't know you was out. (slamming noises) - Karma has finally cuddled with his ass. That's what his trifling ass get. - Was it you? - Zeus, I wanna thank you for getting me out of jail. - Thanks my ass, that freedom come with a debt. Now you owe me. - Tired of you putting your hands on me and my mom, all of that stops tonight. (gunshot) (sniffing) (upbeat music) - Whoa, baby girl, it's just me. - I almost shot you. I did it. I got tired of Wesley and his shit. - Listen. Your mother though, did Wesley do that? - No. I did it. I shot Wesley and my mom tried to kill me. (cries) - I know I'm going to jail, you don't even have to say. - Hold on. No one is going to jail. Listen. Give me the gun. Listen. I'll get rid of this, and imma get rid of the bodies. Do you get this plan? - But I'm bleeding. I gotta go to the hospital. And you know as soon as I go to the hospital, the Detective will come and get me. - Uh-uh. I got something for that. Hold on. (mumbling over the phone call) - I'll see you there. Listen. The street doctor is on the way, you just sit there, let me take care of this one. Okay? - Chloe, What you doing out here? - I had this bad feeling in my gut all day. I've called your father a hundred times and he is not answering the phone. I'm starting to get worried. - Nothing is going on, man. You shouldn't be out here this late at night. - Wait, Noah, what is this on your shirt? Is this blood? Noah, what did you do? - I didn't do nothing, man. Ain't you mad, love, for no reason. - Look, Noah. Your dad just got out of jail and I'm not trying to lose him again to the system. - Nobody's going to jail. - Where's your father and why is he not answering the phone? (groaning) - Fuck! - I appreciate you for coming on such short notice. You already know the drill. You ain't seeing me, I ain't seeing you. - Yeah I know. She been in a lot of pain. Just give her some meds every 8 hours. You're supposed to keep that wound clean. Get plenty of rest and she'll be all right. - All right. Be safe out there. How are you feeling? - Like shit. Thanks for everything. - No, you're family. Anything you need, we got you. Look, take this. - Mr. Zab, I can't take your money. You already done so much for me tonight. - You don't need to stay here tonight. I need to get you warm or some. I want you to take this just in case you change your mind. - Thank you. - I got you. - You got my money? - I need another two weeks. Zeus, you know I'm good for it. - Don't think 'cause you're a pastor, I won't pop a cap in your ass. - I had a little step by that I had to take care of. But everything's back when it's smooth now. I had this dirty cop that was on my ass. I had to get Victor to take care of it. (Zeus mumbling) - Man, I don't give a fuck about all that. They say the Lord work in mysterious ways. So you better mysteriously come up with my fucking money. Get the fuck outta here. I said you're dismissed. - You didn't see me calling you? I was getting worried. - Look baby, I'm sorry. I had to help out a friend, it was really important. How was your day though? - I saw Noah earlier. He had blood on his shirt. I'm starting to get worried about him, especially after he just got shot. - Listen baby, Noah is gonna be fine. Imma make sure of that. What I need you to do, is relax. - Look, I understand. His mother is in rehab, getting herself together. And I'm not trying to replace her. I'm just trying to help. - Listen, I understand. And I appreciate you. Look, I need to go get cleaned up. - Oh hold on queen, I got you. There you go. - Thank you. - No problem. Hey, I'm Noah by the way. - Monique. - Okay, nice to meet you. You must not be from around here though? You don't look familiar. - So what, you know everybody around here? - No, I don't but I'd like to get to know you though. - (chuckles) I don't know. - Why, what's up? You got a man or something? - It's not that. It's my father. He's intimidating and pretty much scares off every man I meet. - I ain't worried about that. Yeah, take my number. We'll worry about your dad later. - (chuckles) Okay. Well, I guess I'll see you around. - Yes, you will. (gentle music) - Hey, what's going on, Ava? You good? Bobby's told me what happened. - Hey Noah. Yeah. I don't got no other choice but to be okay. - You know I'm just a phone call away, right? I got you. - I really can't believe that my mom shot me, you know. She was really willing to choose Wesley over me. I watched that man verbally and physically abuse her every day. I did what I had to do. - Hey, I don't blame you. You gotta do what you gotta do but at the same time, you gotta get out the house. - I ain't left the house since the incident. I don't think I'm ready to go outside. - I mean, I hear what you're saying but staying here, Ava, you gotta got some money. You know what, here, take some money. Me and the guys, we finna go out this weekend. You should really come with us, don't stay in this house. - I don't know. I just don't think it's a good time right now. - Listen, I gotta get out of here but definitely think about coming this weekend, all right? - I'll think about it. - [Noah] All right. - Look who finally decide to show up. - Well, you've been calling, I figured it must've been important. So what's up? - Yup. Remember that bail money I bailed you back out with there? Well, it's time to pay it back. Five jobs, and you're a free man. - Yeah. Five jobs? I'm gonna do what you ask. Then you know the rules. No women, no kids. - Motherfucker, you got this shit twisted. You work for me. You, do whatever the fuck I tell you to do. Get the fuck outta here. Yeah. - That was fun. - It was. - You know you almost fell. - Man, we ain't gonna talk about that. - I mean, I thought you weren't gonna call me for a second. I thought you chickened out. - Man, and miss an opportunity like this? Fuck it. - I mean, I had fun with you tonight. It was pretty dope. Even though you still didn't tell me what you do for a living. - I mean to say, I do construction. - You do not do construction. Not with soft hands like this. No, you don't gotta lie to me. As much as your phone been ringing, I know that you're a hustler. - I just didn't want to scare you away. I'm sorry. - I mean, if we gotta be getting to know each other, we gotta be honest to one another. - All right. You're right. Listen, can we just start over here? - Of course we can. Noah look, I don't mind you being a hustler. Okay? Just promise me that you will not get me mixed up in any of the street foolishness? - I promise. You got my word. I'm not gonna involve you with any of this. - Thank you. All right. Come on, so you can go and meet my dad. - All right, let's do it. Damn, this is La nice. Sheesh. - This is my dad's house. But wait right here, let me go get him. - All right, I got you. (dad clears throat) - Dad, this is Noah, who I was talking about. - Nice to meet you, sir. - Son. Remove that durag by you're in my house. Second, what are your intentions with my daughter? - I just want to get to know her, sir. - I see. What church do you attend? - To be honest, I haven't been to church since I was a kid. - I see. What do you do for a living? - I do construction, sir. - What do you see yourself, in five years? - I mean, I just live my day. Day by day, basically. You know, tomorrow not a promise to anybody. - Monique. Get this loser out of my house. - Dad, that's not fair. Dad. Noah. Noah, hey. I'm so sorry. Sometimes my dad could be a asshole. - It's not your fault, baby. You don't need, he's right actually. - No, he was being an Andromache. You are not a loser. - I'm not but shit, why didn't you tell me that your father was Pastor John, he'd be on the TV every Sunday. - I didn't think that matter, Noah. Fuck my father, the only thing that matters to me is you. - All right, I get you, but I gotta go right now. So, I'll hit you up later. - Okay. - All right. See you later. (sighs) - Yo, Ms. Mary. What are you doing out here this time of night? - I was tryna check before you went in the house. I heard those gunshots the other night, is everything okay? - What gunshots? - Nah, Ava. You know I've been up here since you were a kid, and you ain't gotta lie to me. - Look, Ms. Mary, I wish I could help you but I don't know what you talking about. - You know what's funny? The funny thing is I haven't seen your mother or Wesley since I heard those shots. - You know what, I wish I could help you but I gotta get going. You have a good night. (upbeat disco music) - Hey Noah, what's up? - Yeah I'm at the club, where you at? - I'm at the house. - Man, you gotta get out of there, I ain't taking no friends. - All right, all right, let me put some clothes on and then I'll make up. I'll see you in a little bit. - All right. (fierce upbeat music) - I know that look. Who the chick is? - Damn, is that obvious, bro? - It's all over your face. - Man, I met this chick, she ain't bad and everything but, you know Pastor John? That's her father, man. - Hold on. You talking about Pastor John with the church, the one who I once saw on TV? - Yeah man, that nigga bro. I'm really feeling this shit but, I think he's gonna make us out soon, you know. - You might really really like this girl, bro. - Yeah man, I really do like her. Fuck, man. - [Monique] Hey. - Monique, what you doing here? - Can we have one last talk for a second? - Yeah, what's up? - God damn, slim, would you tell me you by yourself? Why don't you drink with me? What's up? - Thank you, but that won't be necessary. I'm just waiting for a friend. - Well shit, get a drink while we wait. My name's Thomas, call me Tommy though. - Ava. - Ava, damn. - Yeah, so what's up? - I don't know, you tell me. I haven't heard from you since you left the house the other night. - I don't even know what to say though. - I just thought you're agitated. So you gon tell me what's up or not? - Hey man, get your hands off my girl! (gunshots) (continuous gunshots) (people screaming) - Yo, what the hell are you doing here tonight? This ain't safe for you. - I mean, I was calling your phone. I didn't know what else to do. - I'm sorry, man. I just figured you wouldn't want... I don't know. I just figured your father didn't want to see us together. - Well, come to me and let me tell you that. Okay? Before you started making up stuff in your head. - Listen, I'm sorry. How about this. I say we start over? - Okay. I like that. (chuckles) - Hey, you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks for taking me home. - No problem. In fact, I was wondering if we can spend more time together, I can see you again? - I don't know if that's a good idea. I'm kinda going through a lot, and I gotta figure out some things. - Oh my god. That's crazy. I saved your life, I can't even get your phone number? - First of all, you didn't save my life. And second, imma take yours. - I'll take that. That's what I'm talking about. You know what? After some real shit, even though the night was crazy, I had a good time with you. Hopefully, we'll spend more time together. - You have a good night. - I'll take that. (chuckles) - Hi, Detective. May I have a word with you? - Sure. How may I help you? - I live right in the house right over there, and I heard a bunch of gunshots coming from my neighbor house. Ever since I heard those shots, I haven't seen my neighbor nor her husband. - Give me the names. It's Mia Anderson, and Wesley Anderson. - Mm-hmm. Tell me more. I have seen their daughter, Aviana. - Mm-hmm. Okay. I'm gonna look into this and then I'll keep you updated on the information. Okay? - Okay. (gentle music) - Hello? - Hey, Tommy, this is Ava. Did I catch you at a bad time? - Of course not. I was actually just thinking about you. - Oh yeah? Humor me. - I was actually thinking about you coming over tonight. Let me cook for, you know, little soft music, with a wine, with good food. How'd that sound? - You know what? That actually sounds pretty good. I could use some fresh air, some good food, and some nice wine. - Is that right? Well, sound like a date, then? - Okay. It's a date. Hey Noah, what's up? - Hey Ava, how you doing? I'm just checking up on you, make sure everything's good? - You know what? Actually I have been pretty good, you know I came to the club the other day, but as usual, like people are in their band like people are so, Adelaide. - You know it's crazy but listen, I can't stay long, I just came to make sure you're good, and give you a little bit of bread. - Oh yeah. So I see that Zeus must still be paying pretty good, huh? - You know, sometimes he's crazy but I need the cash. So it's like, I'm pretty much stucked between a rock and a hard place. But listen, I gotta go right now, so I'll call you later. - Oh wait. There was one thing I wanted to tell you though. - What's up? - It's my next door neighbor. Ms. Mary, she's been asking a lot of questions. I think that she knows that my mom and Wesley are dead. And, that shit had me mad uncomfortable. - Yo, why the fuck is you just telling me about this? We need to kill her, for all we know she could be talking to the police right now. - We cannot kill Ms. Mary. Are you crazy? - You already know the rules though. No loose ends. She could be talking to the police right now. - All right. You know what? I'm gonna take care of it next week. - Next week? This shit needs to be handled tonight. Like I said, she could be talking to the police right now. You know what you gotta do. - Hey what's up Zeus, you wanted to see me? - As a matter of fact, I do. I need you to go kill this rich scumbag for me. And make sure you leave no evidence behind because a kill like this, will attract a lot of attention. Make sure you wear your mask too. All right. He got any security I gotta worry about or what? - Nah man. This kid right here, should be real smooth. - All right, when you need it done by? - I need the shit done tonight. - Damn, tonight? Man, that shit ain't gonna work, man. I gotta help Ava with something. We could do the shit tomorrow though. (chuckles) - Look, no. I like you, but do I look like a nigga that repeat myself too many times? Get that shit done. I'll send you the address, and the name, and the pictures. (slow, upbeat music) - Oh my god. I forgot to tell you my cooking make panties drop I could tell you that's why I got you here, you know. - Is that right? - Is it? Definitely. The fact that it got you here. All bets are off. Come dance with me. (soft humming) - Yo, what's up bro? You ready to do this shit? - What's up bro? Are you checking information on that video? - Nah man, I ain't had no time. Who is it though? - It's your girl father. - Fuck! - Yeah. - Are you serious bro? - Look, I know that's a girl you know but we gotta do this tonight, man. It's the only way. So go ahead and get your head out of it. All right, man. Shit, I gotta call Ava real quick, man. Yeah, I gotta go change clothes. I'll be back. - Here, taste it. What'd I tell you? - That is really new. - You're in love yet? (Ava chuckling) - So, how did you learn cooking? - I've been cooking since I was 15. My mom taught me all the recipes. I've been dropping panties ever since. - Looks like we need to look into getting you your own restaurant. - Wait, did you just say, we? See, my cooking working already. (Ava laughing) - Hey, Noah. - Yo, Ava. There's a change of plans, man. That shit that you had to do, you gon have to do it by yourself. - Can you give me a second? - Yo, what the fuck you mean you can't make it? You know you were supposed to be there with me tonight. - No I can't. I can't explain right now. I can't do it. I'll call. I gotta go. - Fuck. - Hey, is everything okay? - I'm sorry but I think I'm gonna need a rain check. Is that okay? - Damn. Guess my cooking, is that why you have to go? - No, it's not that. But look, I promise. Imma make it up to you, okay? - I guess so. - Okay. - Ooh. The Lord is my shepherd. He knows what I want. Shit. (gun cocking) - Hey, you know what it is. Come on, take your ass back there. Man, take your ass downstairs. (Pastor John mumbling) Man shut the fuck up, man. - Dad? - Man sit your ass down there. - What's this all about? - You know what the fuck this is about, nigga. (gunshot) (gunshots) - Oh my god, daddy! Somebody help! Daddy! (sobbing) - Oh hey Ava, what are you doing here? - I wanted to talk to you about my mom. Do you mind if I come in? Ms. Mary, I really wish that you just minded your business. (knife cocking) - Ava. Please. Please don't do this. Ava, please. - Beautiful. - Thank you. - Do you know who could've possibly done this to your dad? - I don't know. But I know I shot one of them in the shoulder. - Did you get a good look at their face? - No. But it was two of them. I do know that. - Do you know if your dad had any problems with anybody at the streets, anything of that nature? - No, he was a good guy. I'm left with nobody. - Well, I'm not gonna ask you any more questions today. Here's my card. If you can remember anything that could help me find out who did this, give me a call, okay? (sighs) (suspenseful music) (Ms. Mary sobbing) - I'm sorry. (stubbing sounds) (Ms. Mary sobbing) (Ms. Mary gasping for air) (water dripping) (Ava sniffling) (heavy breathing) - Hello? - Hey Ava, it's me. I was calling to make sure you was all right. Were you jet lagged? You have me here worried. - I'm sorry. I just got a lot going on right now. - Ava, I'm here to help. Don't shut me out. What's going on? - (sniffling) I'm afraid. - Afraid of what? Ava, talk to me. - I'm afraid that if you knew the real me, if you knew all the pain that I hold inside, you'll just run away. - Ava, let me in. You can trust me. - Trust you? I barely know you. - Wow. Okay. And from the looks of it, I don't know you either. You know what? I'm not gonna bother you again. (melancholy music) - Hello? Yeah. What? Man, hell, no one listens with the boss. Are you crazy? You know, bye. Stupid fuckers, they think crazy. - Hey, baby. - Look. We gotta stop this. Your husband's tolling us. - So fuck my husband. You already know how he treats me. And you know I'm divorcing him. - Man, little slip and you can get me killed. And besides, where imma get my product from? - So that's it, after every fucking thing we have been through? - Nikki, what do you want me to do? - I want you to do what's in your heart, baby. - And where do I get my product from? - Well you know I got a hustler out in LA, he can supply you. But any other than that, I want you to do what's in your heart. - All right, all right. (smooches) - See, you gon get me killed, right? Just left by here to get me killed. - Baby, what happened? Are you okay? - Somebody broke here last night and murdered my father. - Are you serious? What happened? - We don't know yet. I just feel so alone. - We gonna get through this together, you know. Do the cops have any leads, like, what's going on? - Not yet. I did see them and get away past, so imma call the detectives to let them know what I saw. - Okay. That's good. So maybe they'll find them in no time. But listen, I gotta go. - No, if I find them, I'm gonna kill them. I swear I'm gonna kill them if I found them. - Baby, this is not your problem. Let the cops handle what they gotta do. You don't want this type of blood on your hands. Baby, listen to me. I gotta go though. I could keep back in an hour. - You leaving already? - Listen baby, I gotta go. - You just got here. - One hour, baby I promise, one hour. We gotta get rid of her car. No, listen man, I don't got time to explain right now. Just meet me there, all right? We got this shit to handle. (suspenseful music) (screams) - What's up man? What's with that attitude. Oh, you know what? I know you need to hit this up. - Aye nigga, cut the shit. Spit that shit out. The fuck you want? - Look. I seem to have gotten myself in some deep shit. Man, I need for you to be my personal security whistleblower. - Nigga, do I look like I give a fuck? You gonna get everything you deserve, nigga. Foul ass nigga. - Motherfucker, did you forget you still work for me? So you do whatever that I say when I say it, motherfucker. - Tell you what. Yeah, I'll be your bodyguard. Cause imma pay this fucking debt off. And after 14 days, nigga, do what you ask, Zeus. - Look, I know I ain't been the nicest motherfucker, but look, I'm scared for my life, I really need your help. So you gonna be there or not? - You ought to be scared nigga, but you know what? Just like I said, after 14 days, we're through! (soft dramatic music) - Ooh. (door knocking) - Can I talk to you? - What do you want? - Look. I wanna apologize for how I spoke to you the other day. You didn't deserve it. - That's it? You figured to come here and apologize, then I forget about everything? Nah, it doesn't work that way. I've been none but nice to you. I deserve somebody that's gonna treat me the way I will be treating. - The day before we met, my mother and my stepfather were killed. - Ava, are you serious? I'm sorry to hear that. I can only imagine what... - I killed them. And I don't feel bad about it. But, it was a strong possibility that if you knew what I had done, then you wouldn't have talked to me anymore. - Ava, look at me. I don't care about none of that. I love you. - Wait, what did you just say? - I said, I love you. - Oh. Did you just not hear what I said though? I just said that I'm a murderer. - I heard all of that and I don't care. But, you're not like a serial killer, are you? - No. - Okay. - Well, listen. Whatever I can do to help you get through this, a company, therapy, anything. I'm here. - Do you mean that? - Every word. - Hey bro, what you gonna do about your dad's girlfriend car, aye? - Shit, I don't even know man. But I need to find out what Monique told the cops. But look, while I'm doing that, I need you make sure you cover our tracks. We can't fall for this shit to blow up in our face, man. - Hey, the only way it don't blow up in our face, bro, we gotta take Monique out. We can't handle loose end. - Come on man, you know I can't do that. That's Monique, man. - Aye, bro. We got to. We work to try, man. You're working, bro. - I don't know, man. - Nah, but we got to. - What do you want? - What do you mean what do I want? Any new development on the case? - Relax. I got her confessed to murder her mother and her stepfather. I got this. - Look, the Lieutenant said that he's about to pull you from the case. We don't have enough money to keep up with the lifestyle that you're doing. So you would have to figure it out and move quick. - No. You tell Lieutenant I need more time. I'm too close. Now won't you ever call this phone again, or you'll blow my cover, and the whole operation. - Noah, wait. Have you seen my car? - Yeah, imma have to get you a new one. - What'd you mean get me a new one? I don't want a new one, I want my car. - Yo, relax. It was breaking down when I was using it. I'm gonna get you a new one. Don't worry about it. - Whatever. I need to talk to you about some though. - What's up? - It's about your father. Have you noticed anything different about him? - No, what you mean? - I mean, he's been coming home later than usual, smells like another woman's perfume. Do you think he's seeing someone else? - I don't think so, but shit, just talk to dad. - I guess. All right. - Hey. - Hey. Thank you for last night. - Thank me? I have you with in bed. I should be thanking you. - I found place for lunch, what are you moving for? - You know what, that would be nice, but I have to go. So, maybe next time? - How about maybe next time, I'll meet Noah? - You know what? Sure. That sounds like a good idea. I'll call you later? (smooches) - Hey, what's going on, baby? - I'm here. - How you doing? - Guess what? - What? - So I spoke to another tech up earlier, and they found traffic lights that's a good projects the guys that murdered my father. So I'm going to the prinsip later to see if I can identify one of those. Isn't that good move? - Yeah, that is. Maybe they could find the people who did it. - Yeah. I'm so excited. Do you want to come with me on intersection? - Actually, I can't. I gotta help pap's with something. I've been holding off for like two weeks. - That's good. - I'll call you later though. Or I could just come over if you want. I know you'd like that. - Yeah, that would be good. - Okay. Got you. - Baby, your shoe untied. - My bad. - Oh this is so good, I can't wait. - I'll call you later, all right? - Okay, see you later. (sighs) - Thank you, baby. I really enjoyed spending time with you today. I wish it didn't have to end. - In order for us to do this, I gotta get all of my fence up. - I know. - Make sure she get home safe. - Listen man, I should be protecting you, not her. - I'm good. I'm in my home. Ain't nobody harassing me. Just make sure she get home, friend. (smooches) (soft suspenseful music) - Where the hell have you been and why are you so happy? Look at that smile. - Because I am happy. - Man, whatever. Did you take care of those neighbor of yours? - Yeah, because I didn't have a choice. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I've been seeing this new guy and I really want you to meet. - Why the hell would I wanna meet your new boyfriend? - Because you wanna make sure that I'm safe. And you wanna make sure that he's not crazy. - I mean, I guess I could, if you really want me to. But to be honest, that's kinda weird, but all right. - Whatever. Okay. So imma text you the address and then we're gonna meet up tonight. Thank you! - So what's your deal? You're not allowed to talk to me or something? - I could talk. I just like to take care of business and keep it professional. - Well, I appreciate you being so protective over Zeus, the way you are. I mean, I don't know what I would do if something was to happen to him. - No disrespect, but Zeus is a grade eight piece of monkey shit. I'm just doing this because I owe a debt. - Well, believe it or not, Zeus is actually a good guy with a great heart. Don't give up on him yet. - The fuck? (suspenseful music) (continuous gunshots) Motherfuckers don't fuck with me! You gonna fuck with me? (gunshots) - Hi, Detective. - Hi Monique, thank you for coming down in short notice. I have a couple of pictures from the video that we said that we catched earlier. I want you to take a look at these pictures. Let me know if you can identify any of these people. Okay? - Okay. No. Their faces are too blurry I can't even make it out. No. - Okay. - Well, thank you for coming in. If we find any information on your father's case I will be glad to let you know, you will be the first to know, okay? - Okay. Thank you. - You're welcome. Uh-oh! One more thing. We did find footprints at the scene that was measured out to be a size-11 Timberland boot. So if you have any information on that, don't hesitate to give me a call, okay? - Yes. I'll call you if I'd know anything else about the case. - Okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - What's in your mind? - You know what, I need to thank you for the other night. You telling me everything, letting me in, feels good to know you can trust me. - Well, if we don't have trust, then we don't have anything, right? - That's true. (door knocking) - Hey Noah, come in. Hey Noah, this is Tommy. - Noah, what's up man? Nice to meet you man. Ava told me so much about you, I feel like I've known you for years, man. - So much? Hope she didn't tell you too much. - Hey man, can I make you a drink? - Nah bro, I ain't staying for that long. - Everything cool about it? Seems like there's a problem. - You damn right there's a problem, nigga. You smell like a fucking cop! - Noah, he's not a cop. - How you know? You checked if he were one? - Stop being ridiculous. - Look, man. Maybe we got it for the wrong foot. I can assure you I ain't a fucking cop. - All right, show me then, nigga. Hold your fucking shirt, nigga. - You're being mad rude and disrespectful right now. I think it's time for you to go. - Listen, man. I ain't no cop. If I was a cop, Ava would've been locked up. She told me about her mom's and stepdad and everything. Listen, she could trust me. - Yo, you told this thing about your mom's? Man, I think he's bugging. I'm out. - Noah, wait. I'll be back. Noah. Wait for a second. It's not what you think. - What the fuck were you thinking? You told this nigga about the murders you committed? That shit don't make no sense. - Noah, I'm sorry. Tommy's a good listener. I needed somebody to talk to. - Talk to? You come at me like you usually do. Not that fucking clown out there. The fuck man? You don't know this nigga from a hole in the wall. You 'bout to have both of us in jail. And I'm not having that. I'm out, man. (gentle music) - Hey. Is everything okay, baby? - Not really. - Listen, I did it wrong. I wanna apologize. - You didn't do anything wrong. It's not your fault that Noah's acting like an asshole. - You shouldn't be so hard on Noah. I mean, I can't blame him for not trusting me, he didn't even know me. - But he knows me. So he should trust me, and my judgment. - I get it. But listen, just chill. Let's talk about this inside. (door knocking) - Damn, baby. - Noah, we need to talk. - What's up? - Did you kill my father? - What do you mean? - Did you kill my father? - Why would you ask something like that? - Still didn't answer the question. - Baby, of course I didn't kill your father. Why would you even ask me some shit like that? - Well, the detectives, they said they found footprints and they looked like they came from your shoes. - Why are you listening to this stupid ass detective, man? She's just playing games with you. Baby, she know you're emotional. She's just using that against you. - You're right. I'm sorry, baby. Look, please don't be mad at me. I'm sorry. - Listen, I just got a lot of shit going on right now. All that shit waited, man. - Wow. So you just gonna leave me when I need you the most? - It's not even like that, man. I just got shit to do. Fuck, man. (sighs) - Hey, son. Have you seen Chloe? - Nah. Why? What's up? - She been missing for about two days, man. I've been looking all over for her. - Are you serious? - Yeah. Man, I'm worried. I'm about to go back out and start looking for her again. - Damn, man. You think she okay? - I hope so, son. Hey, if you hear anything, get my phone. - All right. - Make this quick. You know I can't be seen with you. You'll blow my cover. - You're running out of time. I need you to give me some evidence that I can pin on Ava. - Listen, I already got her own tape confessing the murder her mom and her stepfather. What else you want? - Now you know that will not stick. I need some hard evidence to pin on her. If you do not get this evidence for me, I'm pulling you off the case. Get out my car. - Hey baby. (smooches) Looking good. - Let me talk to you. Look. Baby, I have been in decision for a while. - Zeus? What are you talking about? - Things are just too dangerous and I don't want anything bad happen to you. - Well, I already know the risk, since I started talking to you, baby. - Look, baby, my only job is to protect you. Plus, I don't think you should go home right now. - Are you serious? You know my lover won't lay a finger on me. - Look, I just want you to be smart. Besides, your husband is as good as dead. - You gonna kill him? - Heh. I hired Victor, he's the best in the world. He's out of the country right now but when he gets back, your husband is as good as dead. - I like that. - You like that? - And I got a 2 million dollar policy won. - Really? - It's great, baby. (chuckling) - Well, I guess we got something to celebrate. - Yes we do. (smooches) - Yo, what's good, bro? - Yeah, what's up bro? And man, I need to talk to you, bro. It's about Ava. - What about here? - Word on the street, she dating a cop. - Come on man, you know damn Ava ain't dating no cop. - Man, my bud Ja told me saying Ava with the same undercover cop that got me a few years ago. - Wait, hold on. You talking about a light-skinned dude? Nigga got a ball head? - Yeah, that's him. Man, that's the same dude. He got a couple of cheap shots on him when he arrested me. - Man, I just saw this cop the other day, man. - He probably dating Ava to catch a case on her, man. Bro, we gotta be careful. We gotta stay safe out here. Whatever you do, make sure you don't tell anyone nothing. - Bet man, I got you. Imma holler at you later, man. - Yeah. - Chloe. Are you okay? - What do you care? You ain't my daddy. - Are you high? - Fuck you, Zab. You don't care about me. All you care about is your hoes. - Hoes, what hoes you talking about? - I saw you with that little pretty bitch. So don't even try to lie. - Are you losing your damn mind? - Now I understand why you've been coming home late. I'm not stupid. - I've been working off a debt for Zeus. I've been his bodyguard. That woman you saw me with? That's his old lady. (slaps) - You ain't nothing but a liar and a cheater. I never wanna see you again. - Chloe! Chloe! (water dripping) - What? - Ava, we need to talk. - All right but make this quick cause I have some I need to do. - Well. It turns out that I was right the whole time. Your little boyfriend over here, he's a cop. - You know what, I really don't have time for this shit. - I mean, do your research. You gon find out that I'm telling the truth. That nigga's a cop. - Oh my god. You're jealous. Yeah. I finally find someone that makes me happy. And you cannot stand it. - You just don't get it, do you? This nigga is using you for information, that you're volunteering. Plus, Bobby told me the other day that, that's the same thing that locked him up a couple years ago. Come on man, you're smarter than that. You know what you gotta do. So do it. - I'm not doing shit. I'm not about to kill my man, and a good man at that because your Bobby say so. - Yo, what's up, this nigga got you take more times as long? I just told you what Bobby said. - You know what? Fuck you, and fuck Bobby. I'm not killing nobody until I see some motherfucking proof. Get out of my motherfucking house. - Yo, where the fuck you been? - Hey man, my girl went missing. I had to go find her. - Man fuck that, my safety is far more important than your drunk ass girlfriend. - Zeus, you know we go way back, man. Let me tell you something. You better fucking apologize. - (mumbling) Motherfucker, you work for me. So you do what I say, when I say it. I don't wanna give shit about your bum ass girlfriend that the whole city done fucked. - Let me tell you something, Zeus. You can add me to the list of niggas tryna kill your ass. I'm coming for you, motherfucker. - Fuck outta here. (door knocking) - Hey. - Hey man. Why the fuck you keep calling me the other day? I thought I told you we need a break. - So what, you just never want a day with me ever again? - I'm not saying that. I'm just... - Look, Noah. I know that I shouldn't have questioned you about killing my father. I know that. But, I wasn't thinking straight. It was a lot going on. Baby please, tell me just please start over. - Listen. I understand that, Monique. You're a good girl and everything, and I really care about you. I do, a lot. But it's just every time I got something good in my life, it just get destroyed. - Noah, please stop pushing me away! God, I need you! - Look man, I gotta go. - Well, fuck you then! (suspenseful music) - Fuck! - What's up, Zeus? - I got an important job for you. You ready to get your hands dirty? - You know I'm ready my hands dirty. - Good. I need you to kill Noah. - Is this a joke? Man, you know I be with Noah every day. - Look, Noah and his father, need to be put down. I'll take care of Zab, you take care of Noah. - Why me? - Noah least suspects it. I need this done sooner rather than later. You got a problem with that? - Nah, Zeus. I'll get it done. - Good. Let me know when it's done. (door knocking) - Hey Noah, what's up? - Hey Ava, how you doing right now? - Nothing much. - Listen, I really just want to apologize about the other day. You know, I don't wanna see you hurt. I don't wanna see you in jail, either. - You know I'm the one who should be apologizing to you, right? Man. - What do you mean? - Tommy is a undercover cop. - Fuck! - He's been using me for information this entire time. I found his badge last night when he was asleep. - I knew it, man. But that's really why I came here to talk to you. Me and pap's, we think about just packing up and just leaving at the end of the week. But listen, I got the money for the both of us. We gonna be straight. You sure really think about doing it. - So I'm just supposed to up and leave and start a new life? Like, I don't really think my life can get any better than this. My life is a fucking mess, Noah. - But listen Ava, that's why exactly you need to do this. A new life. A whole new life. At the end of the week. Come on, Ava. - I can't leave right now. I gotta take care of this business. - But kill a cop, though? Ava, are you really thinking clearly? - So I'm just supposed to let this nigga get away with this? Nah. I'm doing it. - All right, how about this? Me and the guys, we've got you. We gonna handle whatever need to be handled. Just make sure you're ready by the end of the week. - Nah, Noah. This is something I gotta do. I gotta take care of this myself. But, I'll be ready by the end of the week, when it's time to leave. - All right. - Get on your knees! (loud, suspenseful music) - Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me! - This is a message from our boss. (gunshots) - You wanted to see me? - Yeah. We need to talk. - What do we need to talk about? - It's about Noah. I'm ordered to kill him but, I can't do it. So I need you to take him to jail. - Wait, none of this is making sense. What are you talking about? - Noah done killed your father. - You're a fucking liar. - Look. I'm the one who took him to the house. Then you came in and shot him in the shoulder. If you don't believe me, check the scar tissue on his shoulder. Just lemme know what you gonna do. I just know you love Noah too. Look, you gotta take him to jail. Find him real quick. - Yo, what's up? What? What you mean Nikki's dead? Find her! You know what? I think I know who's responsible for this. I'm gonna find that. I'm gonna deal with it. (gun cocking) - Damn, Tommy. What are you doing here? You scared me. - Baby, I'm sorry, but I've been calling you. You're not answering my calls. What is going on? - I'm sorry. I just got a lot going on right now. I didn't wanna involve you in my mess. - I thought we agreed you wouldn't push me out anymore. I'm here for you. Let me know what's up. - You know what? You're right. I'm sorry. How about I come over, tonight? How does that sound? - You mean it? - Yeah. - It sounds like it's something we both need. So, my house, eight o'clock. All right? - Yes. I will be there. - See you there. - Oh, what's up Bob? - What's up, howdy? What you doing out, man? - Relaxing, man. What bring you round any past here? - Man, we're looking for Noah. We texted in phone earlier, we supposed to be going in the club tonight. Can't hear from him. - When you? - Tell you what. I just got my man little Noah talking about. - All right. Hey, you sure everything all right? (mumbling) Stay up. - Man, what the fuck you want, man? - Well, thank you for coming. - So? What happened? - Look, Noah. I need to ask you a question and I need you to tell me the truth. Did you kill my father? And, please answer that question honestly so we can just put this behind us. - I don't got time for this shit, man. - Noah. Can you just tell me the truth so that we can put this behind us once and for all, please? - No, I didn't kill your father. - Why are you lying to me? Just tell the truth! - Man, are you fucking crazy, man? Don't call me ever again. - No. Show me your shoulder. If you didn't do anything and you all good, show me your shoulder. What you gotta hide? - Bitch, you are fucking crazy. - No, you're crazy! - Nah, fuck you, man. Don't call me again. - Get out, Noah! - Fuck this shit, man. (growls) - Man, it's a long story, man. She talking about she know I killed her pap's, man. - Bro, I told you, you should've been killing her. - Man, that shit don't sound like a bad idea now, man. But listen, don't tell nobody but me and pap's. We thinking about just leaving. And not a bad idea if you come with us, man. - I don't know about it though. But check this out. - Yo, what the fuck you doing nigga? (gunshots) - Hello? - Hey baby. Yeah, I was just calling to see if you wanted shrimp or steak tonight. Which you wanna move for? - Surprise me, baby. - You sure everything is all right? - I just got a few things on my mind. - Ava, Listen. I know me and Noah did hit it off and I'm sorry for that. But if it means anything to you, I'm willing to try again. - I appreciate that, baby. Okay. Let me get my stuff together. And I'll see you tonight. - Ava, I love you. - What did you say? - I said, I love you, and I mean that. - I love you too. (zipper sounds) (sighs) - Look, what's up? Make this quick. I gotta get back. - The assignment is over. You're off the case. - What'd you mean I'm off the case? - You haven't given me not one piece of evidence to convict Ava, and we both know why. - And why is that? - Well, let's start off with you falling in love with the assignments. That wasn't part of the agreement. You were supposed to give me evidence to convict Ava but I'm gonna notify the captain and let the captain know. And if you're even been seen with Ava, I'll make sure that you're prosecuted to the maximum sentence. - Nice try, motherfucker. I allowed you coming for me, but you crossed the line when you killed Nikki. - Kill Nikki? Man, What the hell are you talking about? - Don't play stupid, motherfucker! I'll teach you what it's like fucking with me. Drive. - I'm fucked up. - Hey let me hold with you. Which way you've been? - The night I decided to try and find myself, can you believe Zab's been cheating on me? - No say. Zab's always been greedy. - Yeah. I did some research and I found out that the chick he's been cheating on me with, name is Nikki. Imma beat her ass when I find her. You know I don't play. What you up to? (gunshots) (gentle music) - Hey, baby. Damn, for a second I got nervous. I thought you're not gonna make it. How you been? - I've been better. Listen, so what we talking about. I know you got a lot going on, and maybe it wasn't the right time to tell you I loved you. But that's truly how I feel about you. You all right? - No, I'm not all right. You were what's wrong with me. When are you gonna start being honest with me, Tommy? I mean, if that's even your real name. - Baby, what are you talking about, baby? What is going on with you? Talk to me, what's up? (slams) - You must think I'm fucking stupid - Ava, what the hell are you doing? - Tell me the truth. - What are you talking about? (gunshots) - You better start talking, Tommy. And you better start talking, right now! - Calm down. Where do you want me to start? - Are you a cop? - Yes, I'm a cop. I'm on a undercover assignment. I'm sorry. - What was the assignment, Tommy? - You're the assignment. I was said to get information on you and your crew to put you all away for some crimes, specifically homicides. - You son of a bitch. You had me trust you and confide in you this whole time. And you were just fucking setting me up? - Baby, I swear to you. That was when it started. Just before I got to know you. Once I got to know you, like really know you, baby. I realized you're not a monster. You and Noah was just kids at the wrong place, at the wrong time. Just put the gun down, please. - Turn around. - Baby, come on, baby. You gotta believe me. - Take me to the evidence. I want everything that you got. - Baby. You're not thinking baby. Come on. - Move, and I will shoot your head off. - No, baby. I don't want you to go away. You told me, you murdered your mother and your stepfather. Why do you think you're not in jail, baby? You're not thinking, come on. - Because you haven't finished building your case. - No, that's not it. Listen, let me text you something. I gotta show you this. Don't shoot. Please, don't shoot. Imma text you something. There. I texted it to you, baby. You gotta believe me. - You have a video of me coming out of Ms. Mary's house? - That's probably trying to tell you, you've been under surveillance for a while. I knew you killed your next door neighbor. I didn't say anything. I was protecting you. I knew you did what you had to do to survive. You did what anybody in your position would done. Baby, come on. - What else do you know, Tommy? - I know you're not the monster they're making you out to be. Believe it or not, they kicked me off the case. I wouldn't give them evidence that was gonna put you away, baby. I kept everything because I love you. Ava, you gotta account for something. Come on, baby. Please, baby. Come on, baby. Please. - I loved you too. (gunshots) (dramatic music) - Victor, what's up? - Just got back in town. How can I help you? - I need two motherfuckers erased, and I need it done ASAP. - All right. Just send me their profiles and once the money hit my account, their lives will be on the countdown. - It's done. I sent you the names, address and pictures. - Just keep your eyes on the news. - Damn. Man, I figured I'd find you here. - He had evidence that could pull me away for life. But he didn't turn it in because he loved me. Tommy loved me, and I killed him. I'm a monster. - You're not a monster, Ava. You had to do what you had to do, man. - Did I? He knew all of my secrets and he didn't turn me in. I'm never gonna find love like that again. - No man, never say never. (Ava sniffling) - I'm so sick of this shit. I'm just turn myself in. - Nah, man. You talking crazy, man. I can't let you do that. Listen, I'm gonna go home and get my stuff. Then we gon go to your cram and get your stuff. And then we just gonna get out of here, man. This is actually a chance to start over. A brand life. - Start over? Noah, I'm too damaged to start all over. - You know, we gon be all right, yeah? Listen, Tommy has some cash here somewhere. Let me go find it. Okay? All right. - Uh. Can I help you? - Where is Noah? I need to talk to him. And who the fuck are you? - I'm Ava. Who the fuck are you? How did you even get in here? - I'm his girlfriend. - That's funny, because I never heard him talk about you before. - Look lil bitch, I got no time to play with you. You gonna tell me where my man is, or not? - Yo, Monique, what's up? What you doing here? - We need to talk. - Now is not a good time. - Well, I'm not going anywhere until you talk to me. - Bitch, did you just not hear what the fuck he said? - Yo, Ava, chill out. I got this. Yo, let's go upstairs and talk, man. Yo, what the fuck you wanted, man? I'm busy. - I said, we need to talk. - Well, now is not a good time, man. Just go home, I'll call you later. - No, motherfucker. I said we need to talk right now. - Yo, what are you doing, man? Chill out. - (chuckling) What am I doing man? How, it's funny. All this time, all I gotta do was point a gun at you, to get your attention? (chuckles) - Yo, why the fuck you laughing though? It's not even funny, just put the shit down, man. - Take your shirt off, Noah. Let me see your shoulder. - Yo, I got no time for games just put the gun down. (gunshots) - I said take your fucking shirt off! You think I'm playing with you? I know it was you that killed my father. I know it's you. I know it was you. - Your father, he was a drug dealer. They owe some nigga some money. I was just sent to collect. - Nah. My father was a man of God, not some fucking drug dealer. - I swear baby, that's the truth. - You're a fucking liar! You killed my father! - [Noah] I just didn't know how. - [Monique] No. How many times? You can not rest until he's dead. Now, I'm gonna kill you. - [Noah] Baby, I swear I wanted to tell you. I just didn't know how. - I asked you! (gunshots) I asked you, Noah! How many times did I say, did you kill my fucking father? How many times, Noah? - [Noah] Monique. Please. You're not a killer, don't do this. - No. I'm doing this. You killed my father, and I will not rest until I do this. Bye, baby. (Ava faint screaming) - Bitch! (gunshots) - Noah. We gotta go. Come on. - No, go. I'm not gonna make it. - No, I'm not leaving you here. Come on. Noah, Come on. - The bitch shot me. (two suspicious men murmuring) (gunshots) - [Zab] Zeus! Come down, you coward! Zeus! - I heard somebody looking for me. - [Zab] Come on down, you coward! - I'll be right there. (loud, suspenseful music) - I see you got that look in your eye. Let's see, maybe years inside here did you some good. (suspenseful upbeat music) (slamming sounds) (Zeus groaning) (gunshots) - Call it off. Call it off! Call him off! - Hey, Victor. It's over. You happy now? - Delighted. (smacks) (upbeat music)
