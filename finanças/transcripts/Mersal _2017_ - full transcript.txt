Selvam, a tea! Mari, keep an eye on the shop. I have to wash some dishes. Okay. Sir! Is this vehicle available? This is ambulance. Is it a share auto? Get lost! Won't you take me in this ambulance? I'll hit you. A nuisance in the morning! What do you use the ambulance for? -Madcap! -Let me be. It's used for people taking their last breath... -or are dying. -I see! You leave. What is this, sir? You could have told me this in the first place. Hey, make it fast! It is getting late. Wait, do I have ten hands? I can be quick but will the chicken rush for you? How can I make her understand the importance of time? Dumb head! This man won't even wait for ten minutes. Hello... my dear! Ask! I'll come in the morning. If there is any emergency case at midnight, don't admit them without payment. Okay? Purush, I saw a diamond necklace at the Ayush jewelry store. Mukundan wanted to talk to you. You go ahead. Murthy... Are we running a charity? It is a hospital. First ask them to pay ten lakhs. After that I'll come to the operation theatre... and start the surgery, okay? -Who are you? -I'm your best friend. Purushoth! Purushoth... Mysterious killings of physicians in Tamil Nadu continues. Early today morning an ambulance driver... A manager and a heart specialist in a private hospital... Also, a chemist working in a pharmacy nearby the hospital. These four victims have been kidnapped by a mysterious miscreant. Greetings, sir! Sir, we've got the GPS information of the suspect's location. Stop that truck! Stop! No vehicle can enter. Sir, there are 2000 homes inside. There are small children as well. -We have to be on time. -I know, wait. You don't have to deliver newspapers today. Go home. Hey, go inside. Father! -Maniya, ready? -Yes, sir! All the cameras are in position and they're all live, sir! Thennarasu? Sir! Sir, the suspect is inside. Who yelled at my son? -You won't cross my area. -Take the child in. My Lord! Brother...! I'll self-immolate if you don't release my brother. Palani bro, turn left. You must answer sir's questions in the blink of an eye. If you don't, it'll be snuffed. Your life. Trying to scare me? I'll be right next to you. If you lie, I’ll find out with one look at your eyes. -Then you are gone. -Palani bro. -Can you do me a favor? -Tell me, sir! Go down and check if everything is okay. Are you indirectly asking me to clear out, sir? Not at all. I'm telling you directly. -Humiliating me? -I'll be waiting downstairs. Leave. Dr. Maaran. Actually two years ago when I accepted this case I was interested in nabbing the criminal. But now I have my own doubts. Who are you? Are you a criminal? A terrorist? Or the leader of an ethnic clan? Who are you? Vicky! Tomorrow India will wage a war on Paris, blockhead! You want me to fly? I don't have wings, lady! Should I stand with my feet apart? If my language and my attire irks you... then I don't have to change. You do. Anna! -I'll apologize on their behalf, brother! -No, it’s all right, dear. They think anyone who is dark is a thief. Whenever we think we are big shots we should just come to the airport. The way they treat us will show us that we're just ordinary people. I didn't say this. It is Shahrukh Khan's quote. Dr. Abdul Kalam and actor Kamal Haasan have been insulted too. If this is their plight, where do I stand? No, brother! They didn't recognize you in this 'dhoti' attire. When you come the next time... Even if I come here a thousand times I'll come the same way. I can't change my mother for their sake. Mother? If you call me "brother", don't we share the same mother? Tamil bonds us. Did they finally let you go? They have to, right? Because I created such a ruckus. A taxi? Why don't you call a horse carriage? Who does he think you are? Even at midnight, he'll greet you with a smile and treat you. He is not a doctor. He is my brother. Not just to me, he is a brother to all those who suffer like me. -Maaran... -He'll take only Rs five. If we can't afford it, he'll still attend to us. He is a God! I witnessed with my own eyes. It was Doctor Maaran only who paid my school fees. I'm going to study like him and become a doctor. I'll provide free medical aid for everyone. That is my desire. Being humane. Being humane is not the best quality of a human being. It is a basic quality. The medical profession was started to serve human beings. But today, that very service is turning out to be the number one business in today's world. Isn't life the same for everyone? Is it different for the rich and the poor? No, right? A country's richest man... The medical facility that he receives... should be received by the poorest man in that country. Only a country with that attribute... is the best in our world. Each and every person in this world should get free treatment, until then I'll continue to fight. I participated in this function only to record this dream of mine. -Are you from Chennai? -Yes, from Triplicane. I wonder how they find people like you living in dingy alleys. Maybe their criteria is "the shabbier the better". Are you an MBBS doctor? Or Siddha, Unani or some allied course. No, doctor. I did M.B.B.S, M.D. You are treating people with just five rupees. Yes. Join our hospital. Our image will be enhanced by a noble soul like you. We earn a lot. Don't we get blessed if we help people? After that, making monetary benefits... is my responsibility. No, doctor. Your route is different. -My route is different. -I'm asking openly. What is your price? No need, doctor! Leave it. Are you saying you won't? It won't work out. If I make up my mind, you can never touch a stethoscope your whole life. No, doctor! Leave it. -Don't you get it? -Don't you get what I said, man? I tried respecting your age and being courteous didn’t it enter your thick skull, man? Your blockhead only understands curt words, does it? Hey! If you have such a swollen head walking on the Boat club road, imagine the amount of pride I who jog on Marina beach have? Will you shut down my clinic? Try tampering my lock worth just Rs 10! I swear you'll be dead meat. Doctor? Dhoti and shirt. Did you pin me down as a dunderhead? I'll pound you to pulp! Don't think you can threaten me. I'll wipe you out. You'll end up in hell. What's "jimmicks" saying, handsome? Ignore him. Junk of a jerk! "Chapter closed" Meathead! We are late. Come fast. I had gone to the Airlines office. That's why I couldn't come to the function. -What about my ticket? -This is peak season time. There are no premium tickets for the next three days. We'll leave few days later. Inform Daniel. This place is too good. Cool chicks everywhere. I'll take a shower. You get ready. I'll hook seven-to-eight white skin chicks, get married and parade them. My prince! -Mother... -How are you? -I'm fine. -My precious, I saw you on TV. You are radiating and colorful like our evergreen hero MGR. I think we need a new TV in our home. You are teasing me. Be a sweetheart and stand facing east. -What? -I'm telling you to stand facing east. -What for? -To dispel all the evil eyes. Let the envious evil eyes of men, women, birds and beasts be scorched by this spell. Darling, please spit? -What? -Spit, it is part of the spell. Keep talking, my dear son! I'll be back in a minute. Whom will I talk to? Mother! Mom! Madcap mummy... -How are you, kids? -Hi, bro! This is Mani. You aced it, bro! -Okay. okay. -This is 'Fire' Guna I'll erect a banner from your fan club. Don't go overboard, buddy! Use that money to buy medicines for people. Okay... okay. You won't let us do what we wish. Bro, chocolate. Foreign chocolate. Get me if it is available there, bro! If I buy it abroad it means foreign chocolate, idiot! Step aside. I hardly get time to talk to my son. -Clear out. -Mom... -What do you want? -Get a delightful daughter-in-law. -You don't get that in a shop. -Dear... One can survive without eyes. But wife is life's best prize. This quote can be written behind autos. That's your mummy. Don't go in a dhoti and shirt. No girl will give you a second look. If you step out wearing jeans and a smart coat, you'll catch the perfect match. I might exhaust my data. Here's mother waving, bye! Moon in the rain. I'm flying... In the rain... Wow... -Outside silence. -Please! Please! So embarrassing! Making such a fuss to drink coffee. I have a splitting headache. I need coffee now. I have only five euros with me. He says it's ten euros for the coffee. He's even refusing to take my card. Just one cup. We left our wallets behind in the room. Can you order two coffees for us as well? -Please! -No! Two cups for us and two cups for you. Need the balance for our taxi, boss! Change for the taxi. Clean bowled -Listen, bro. -Take your hands off. -Why? -I'm a girl. A girl? You didn't tell at all. -Tamil? -Yeah! Do I look dubious because I spoke in Tamil? From Chennai. I've come here for one of our chief doctor's medical conference. Really boring trip. Oh. Won't you tell about yourself? My name-- Oh God! Follow his orders without getting flustered. That's a torn wallet. Nobody has money there. Only a long queue. I don't feel bad telling you. Everyone in India is poor, brother! It's my mother's. Give it, we'll see what to do. Give it, dear. We'll see what to do. I repeated what he said. My mother's. Let go. Leave. Let go. Oh my dear! Dove. -Yes. -Yeah! Hold this. Yeah! -Handbag. -Is it magic? What is there inside the handbag? -Lipstick, eyeliner. -What else? -Power bank, chocolates. -What else? What else? My family deity's picture. -Name? -Goddess Shakti's avatar. Sweetheart, this will do. Goddess Shakti's avatar? That's my grandma's name. This is never ending long. Praise Lord Shiva! How and where will I find it? What are you looking for? My neighbor who is an old lady told me... "My dear grandson, if you go abroad, get me the latest machine to grind my betel nut without fail. Don't come empty handed or my broomstick will speak. I'm unable to find anything suitable." Why don't you ask in your accent English for a pestle and mortar? We might lose him in the crowd. Brother... Why is that vehicle taking a U -turn in our bus stop? Wait here, okay? Wow, dear! Hey, black coffee! -Hi, magic! -Hi, popcorn! Hey, chick-lee! What are you doing here enjoying all by yourself? You saw me enjoying by myself? My chief doctor is running behind a Russian chick. -We are running behind them. -You mean... Carry their shopping bags and being within their earshot. Taxi, navigations, route map. In short, a helper. How old is that "slimy-junk head"? -Fifty plus. -The 50 plus is flirting with 30 plus. Why is this 20 plus empty plus and free? -So, what should I do? -Have a gala time with this 25 plus. Baby... baby... baby... Didn't you get a handsome Tamilian in such a big city? I did. But, before I could woo him, he turned into a snake and slid away. If I think and see, -you need to do only one thing. -What? -You're shouting. -What? You're shouting. I'm very happy. To be frank, these three days that I spent with you, each and every second, was like a dream. Like a fantasy. -To me as well. -Don't bluff. -No, Pallavi. I mean it. -Tell me. Not today. I'll tell tomorrow. I came here to fulfill my dream. Do you know what my dream is? Le paradise. World's most spectacular... magic show. I wish to fulfill another dream of mine also at the same venue. Oh man. Dragging me here and there. I can be only where my boss is, right? Bring him along too. He can sit in the VIP row. You can sit in the back row. I'll come to you and tell you. The spark of fire gory that You set aflame in the past To blaze in all the glory It'll ask you at last The deeds of karma you sowed in a flurry Will wait to sever And stamp you with fury Maaran? Vetrimaran! Money, name, fame, authority. If a person loses any of these he can retrieve it. If a true friend is lost... Who is he...huh? We can find out, sir! We can find out. Because this time we've a clue in this murder which we didn't for the -previous six cases. -Sir. Let me tell you. For 20 minutes he conducted a magic show on this very stage in a spectacular manner without a flaw. But at the same time the original magician, David Skale, right? Was administered anesthesia to be sedated strongly for eight hours. A doctor who knows magic or a magician who knows medicine. Isn't it, sir? We can nab him. We are very close. Randy, only if you catch him he'll be alive. -Mania... -Sir? Those who talk harshly can be trusted a little bit. But the ones who speak in hushed tones? Shouldn't be trusted at all. Do you think this guy has any connection with this case? He seems to be such a gentleman. Stylish and carries himself well. Can't be, sir! Sure, you are right. There must be a link, sir! What's all this fanfare? What is all this? My darling prince! -Good morning! -He is the Health Minister. You made us all proud. -I'm the Health Minister. -I know. Maara, The Prime Minister, President and all the ministers called me to praise me so much in Hindi. They spoke as if I got the award. We are 'trending' in 'Scooter'. He means Twitter, sir! Take a hike! Maara, I want to grant you something you can't even imagine. Ask me what you want. I don't want anything. -Do you want the KMC hospital? -That's a Government hospital, sir. What do you mean the Government? I know our Government from A to Z. What does 'Government' mean', tell me? You would have thought of a perfect answer, tell us. For the people, By the people, Of the people. -What do you say, Maaran? -Yes... yes... Maara, I'm asking out of love. You enter politics. I have decided. In this year's Medical Council Election you are going to contest as 'Head' and win. Hey, Nagesh! Give the garland. My wishes! -Goodbye! -Goodbye, madam! Dear, stand facing the east. Stand facing the east. Let the envious evil eyes of men, women, birds and beasts be scorched by this spell. Spit! -Hey! -Yes. You must talk only when I talk. -This is not good. -We are there to support you. Our team is there. Specify the action to be taken on your third husband. Big deal! You asked this for the other two husbands also. My intention is only to unite you both. You understand that. Open u.. Don't be scared. we and our team are there. Tell us. -You come out. -Hey, come on! -Come on. Cry now. Be blunt. -Open up. Oh Shit! -Tears would have hiked our rating. -Hi, buddy! -Tell me. -Come in. What happened? Good news for you. -Are you resigning? -Tell me. The show I anchored is all yours now. Super, Machi! We'll ace it. -Who is the guest? -Tomorrow's guest is a doctor. His name is Maaran. He's called the 'Rs five doctor' in his area. He doesn't have WhatsApp, Facebook. No account on Twitter. He doesn't even carry a cellphone. He isn't a human. Yes. Our open challenge is... he has never agreed to be interviewed on TV. Somehow convince him and make him come to our channel. What do you say? Shall we get him? We'll get him, girl! I spoke to Sheela, the receptionist. What a voice! It was melody to my ears! This clinic seems to be huge. I think a rice go-down is used as a hospital. On enquiring with Sheela we'll get all the details. First, I must meet Sheela. What is it? Are you here to deliver the water can? Unload it there. I didn't come to talk to you. Call the receptionist Sheela. I want to talk to her. I'm Sheela. With one step in the grave you are showing off! Ask her where the doctor is. We want to meet Dr. Maaran. Call him. He'll come at 4pm. Go and sit there. Is he the patient, dear? Poor chap! His face is so misshapen, isn't it? -First remove the cap. -I'll remove. My time is bad! Go and mop the floor. Go. -Take your cap off. -You too, Brutus! What a stupid name, Sheela! Look at the face. Like a stale bloody cookie. She is mopping the same spot. Is this new wad of Rs 500 also not valid? He is so generous! Hey, Kulfi ice-cream head! Come here. Why are you donating wads of Rs 500? Last year my son met with an accident and was about to die. All the doctors gave up hope. Dr. Maaran came like God and saved him. He has sent his 1st pay check of two lakhs from USA. To be fair it should be offered only to God. My God is Dr. Maaran. That is why I donated here. He won't even take this money. He'll use it to save some other life. Nola! I'm burning with curiosity. I must see that face. Ask your sweetheart his whereabouts. Hey! -Where will the doctor be right now? -Now it is play time. He'll be in the area playground. Don't go there. The doctor will scold. Nola, how to find the doctor in this? Hey! Hey, bro! Come here. You are the one I'm calling, bro! Try a googly. He'll be clean bowled. Look at his swagger! -What is it? -Who is the 'Rs five doctor' here? Whoever looks like a doctor at the first sight, -is the doctor. -In that case, you leave. You are smart, bro. -Thanks! -Okay, move. Let me take a look. No one fits the bill. -Can't you make out? -No. -You really can't? -No. He is the 'Rs five doctor'. -Take him. -Him? He is the one, girl. See. He is holding the bat like a syringe. Take him. Should I interview him? Okay, bro. Come with me. I need to talk to you alone. Doctor will hit all around the ground. If there is no one to field, he'll shout. I have to field. Take your hands off. Is he Sehwag to be hitting fours or what? He hasn't even tapped a single ball. Tell him and come. I'll get you a glass of Rose milk. Rose milk? Hello, keep an eye on the field. -I'll be back. -You go, Bowl! Bro, you look like a very good boy. Will you help this sister out? Tell me. You know this 'Rs five junk of a doctor'. -Sister! -It seems that he is a big shot. He refuses interviews, right? He is a bit short tempered. He'll suddenly slap you while talking. Then you are my man. Do something and get him to my studio tomorrow. For this sister, please! -I'll do it for your sake. -Mother promise? -Sister promise. -It's the first time in the world I'm seeing such a promise. Both of you bonding together as brother and sister, -even I feel tensed. -Shut up! Bro... Sister? Come. Don't get me wrong. Keep it for expenses. It's okay. I can manage. -Don't bribe him. -What's your idea? Take a selfie, he can show off in his area. Happy, bro? Come, bro! Smile... Okay, give your number. I'll WhatsApp the photo. Four-eight-two-five Nine-seven-five. Is it a landline? Yes. My neighborhood PCO. Send it there. I'll collect it when I go that side. He's stuck in the time frame of 80's. Old age fellows! Bro, I hope you won't forget my request. You bought me rose milk. Will I ever let you down? The doctor will be there at sharp 10am tomorrow. -Don't worry. -Bye! See you. What is it? Nothing, you are a smart man. -Don't be so honest. -You are breed apart. Aw! Our boss is looking here. He'll simply whimper. Why did you greet him? Nolan, will he come? Yes, Tara. Auto... Holy shit! Why is he alone? We are screwed. Bro, where is the doctor? He had a surgery. He told me to stand in. Holy shit! Sorry, not aimed at you. -Akka! -I'll butcher you. How can you stand in? I do all the mimicry in my area's temple festival. I can imitate the doctor. No problem at all. Imitate Vijay. Go on. "If a man can shake the ground with his punches, he is a Tamilian." This is not a radio but a TV interview. You agreed to an exclusive interview to our channel. We are very proud. Look at him show off! How did you agree to give interview to our channel? She is a bigger liar. I liked the way they approached me for the interview. With lot of respect... -With humbleness... -Yes. I accepted this interview for her sake. Shall we start? This is Tara welcoming all of you to "The Noble Soul" programme. This is my first show. My first guest is Dr. Maaran. For all of you to understand... the "five rupees doctor". Don't you feel that this Rs 5 fees is very less? An average Indian's monthly income is Rs 1570. That means Rs 50 per day. As far as he is concerned Rs five is a lot of money. Do you have any idea how to raise the standard of Government hospitals? Chief Minister, Prime Minister, President, Governor, politicians, I.A.S and I.P.S. officers. In a nutshell, if a law is enforced that all Governement staff should join only Government hospitals, all Governmentt hospitals will match International standards. Which doctor do you consult or what medicine do you take when you catch a cold or fever? Dr. Sarala. She is just a 5th grader. My mother. She is my family doctor. The pepper "rasam" she makes is the best medicine in the world. Doctor, do you think it is possible to give free medical aid to all? I say that it is impossible. What are you saying, sir? TV, mixie, grinder, fan as freebies. Giving people Rs 5000 for a vote. Our state is known for doing such things. Can't we give medicines? Statistics claim that India has taken giant strides in the field of medicine. Do you agree to that as a doctor? Because you say we have progressed in a cinematic style let me quote our hero "Vijayakanth". "By creating best doctors and sending them to 34 foreign countries, India stands first." At the same time in providing proper medical aid for their own people India occupies the 112th position. Fifty-seven-point-three percent of doctors in India lack proper medical qualifications. Do you know the number of medical errors in India per year? Fifty-two lakhs. In a nation with a population of 120 crores if only 120 people enjoy proper medical aid, it isn't called "progress". What do you think is the biggest scam of medical history, doctor? Medical check-up. How many of you are normal here? Lift your hand. You go to medical check-up once. Not even a single person will lift their hand to say they're normal. Normally... Put your hands down. To convert normal people like you into patients, the techniques resorted to by corporate hospitals are medical checkup. I'm Dr. Ramachandran. I think you are accusing the entire doctors’ fraternity. You think all doctors don't have ethical values? Definitely not, doctor. In the midst of 100 efficient doctors there are at least ten doctors using medicine as a business tool. They're the ones who'll get irritated with my responses. -Are you angry? -No! -Beautiful point. -Why are you single till now? I haven't fulfilled my dream till now. Not only that. Who'll like this "Rs five doctor"? If by chance anyone likes me, surely I'm ready to marry... that girl. We'll all pray that you find such a bride. Your final question. Free medical aid to everyone. That is what my dream is. You answered beautifully. Good answers are the prize for good questions. Till we meet again next week in the "The Noble Soul" programme, this is your Tara saying goodbye. Hey, bro! I need to talk to you alone. Come. Patients will be waiting. -I have to go. -I'll get rose milk for you. Rose milk? Ready, brother! Ready... ready... We'll abduct the ambulance driver in Besant Nagar. It is safe to abduct the agent in the house itself. We can nab the HR in the hospital. Doctor can be packed off while he jogs tomorrow. All the four lambs will be in the slaughter house tomorrow. Lamb chops? Mincemeat? Or steak is a choice you have to make. "Kaput". What? This is very tough, isn't it? It is easier to finish off someone. To kidnap people by taking so much trouble. Hide the victim safely. Making us curious. Make the media rave and rant. Actually, it resembles our director Shankar's film. To hound the wrong doers and murder them. Knock out for good is your style. What's this new game, kidnapping? All the abducted victims are connected to hospital. That alone fits in your jig saw. But... I'm unable to stand this suspense. Please break it for me, huh! -Poo, getting late for school. -Okay. -Did you take everything? -Yes, I took everything, dad. -Bye, Father! -Poo! Sorry, father! I forgot. Have super rides today. The school is organizing a tour it seems. I said the school is organizing a trip, Father. Did I say that I'm going? They are asking for Rs 200. For a single day. It is a waste. I can watch TV serials with mother at home. I can play happily with our neighbor Banu's brother. Twenty-four hours will fly by. You are already struggling to educate me. Why add to your expense? Grown up lady! Give this Rs 200 to your teacher. Ask her to add your name in the tour list. No need, father. Take it. I can make Rs 500 overnight with my rides. Look at your father. I'll save you whatever the cost. Look at your father. Dear! Twenty percent sounds good, right? -Tell me. -Ganesan, a 12-year-old girl. School girl. Hit on the head. Skull injury. Which hospital do I bring her to? -Bring her to Prabas hospital. -Okay, bro! -Go fast. -We'll reach. -Hold her head firmly. -Oh God! She is bleeding all over. You just crossed GH. Where are you going? The government hospital? This is accident case. They'll ask 1008 questions. They'll take six days to admit her. Do you want to take your child there? There is a private hospital nearby. They'll start treatment immediately. There won't be any problem. -You'll be fine, dear! -Tell me, bro! Where are you? I'm on the way. I'll be there in two minutes. Don't come here. They are useless. Bargaining for 10% and 15%. Unimercy hospital is offering 25%. It's a superb deal. You take a U-turn. It's 5km. You can reach in ten minutes. Will the party hold on for ten more minutes? -Yes, bro. -Bring the girl. We won't get even ten paisa if you bring a dead body. No problem. See you soon. Okay, Ganesh! You come. I'll give you the commission. Head injury trauma case. Inform Dr. Venketesh Babu. Arrange the operation theatre. Madam, send a stretcher to the entrance immediately. The ambulance will be here in five minutes. Have we reached the hospital? It is nearby. We'll reach soon. Palani, make a bill for 100,000 with all the break down figures. -Okay, sir! -I'll be right back. Sir, our hospital is the best for trauma cases. Ninety-five percent success case. We'll save your daughter for sure. Don't worry. Don't cry. We'll handle. -What do you do? -I'm an auto driver. Is there any medical insurance in your daughter's name? Okay, don't worry. Palani! -Sir! -Take sir and register an admission. Sir, you first pay whatever you have and fill up the admission form. I'll talk to the doctor meanwhile. Don't worry. We are there for you. -You can trust us. -Come, sir! -What happened, doctor? -Too late. If she had been brought ten minutes earlier, there would have been less complications. Skull is broken. If needed, we can do surgery. But useless. You said that operation can be done, doctor. Do it. It is a waste, Kumar! She won't survive. It'll cost six lakhs. Her father is an auto driver. -Can he afford it? -Only the rich will think about paying. After paying they'll bug us with queries. He'll insist on a 2nd opinion. He'll shift to a better hospital. But people like him will blindly trust us. He'll borrow money and pay us. If something untoward happens, without a fuss he'll take the body home. Okay, tell him to pay the money. I'll step inside the operation theatre. Till then can you ensure that she doesn't die? She'll last for a while on the ventilator. It is a painful process. You don't delay. Ask him to pay up at the earliest. I'll take care. -What happened? -Relax. Surgery is required. Doctor says she can be saved. Else it is difficult... Don't cry. It'll cost six lakhs for the operation. I explained to him about your situation. You can take your daughter to another hospital if you want. But now it is not advisable and it is a risk. Tell me what I should do? Can I see my daughter once, sir? You come. See from here. Get the money quickly as we have to operate her soon. Don't go, father! Don't go. -Yes, sir! -I have paid the money, sir! After the surgery I'll pay the balance. I know that you'll pay. Your child has been taken to the operation theatre. Don't worry. We are there. Immediately put the stitches. Make it look like she was operated and hand over the body. I'll talk to her parents. -Doctor... -Doctor... Sorry, I couldn't save your daughter. -Oh God, Poo! -Dear, Poo! I tried a lot. Her will power is very low. -Kumar, deal with them. -Okay. Madam, you can't cry here. If you want, go out and cry. Sir, my daughter passed away. How can we remain without crying? Why are you troubling everyone? -I wish to see my child once. -You can see her. You owe a balance of 1.5 lakhs. Pay that, take your daughter's body do the needful. This isn't fair. Not at all fair. How can you prevent a mother from seeing her dead child? -In what way is this fair? -I'm not saying she can't see her child. I have a conscience too. All I'm saying is pay up and take her home. She saw only my face the moment she was born. -But now you say I can't see her. -Don't repeat the same. -Pay the amount and... -Don't give it. Are you bargaining with us with my dead child as bait? You can keep it yourself. She's short tempered. Spoke out of turn. Please let her see our child's face just once. -I'll somehow pay the balance. -My child... Selvi... No decent dress to wear. No proper shelter. No food to appease hunger. To educate a person, the entire family has to struggle. What do poor people have? Only their lives. If a person takes even that life lightly, how do we punish him? By any chance is it possible that the four victims are alive? If that girl was taken to the right hospital in ten minutes, if the right treatment was started in ten minutes, that girl won't have died, sir. If you go within ten minutes, all four of them can be saved for sure. Your time starts now. Pull it fast. He is stuffed into an iron casket for three days and the oxygen level provided is below half of a human's daily requirement. It is done through a device. He has suffocated for three days and passed away due to damage of lungs. In doctor's terminology, a healthy man was hooked on to a ventilator and killed. If we had arrived ten minutes earlier, we could have surely saved him. -Ten minutes... -Same thing. Everybody thinks I took the trouble to nab you. You are not here because of my wish. You are here only because you wished. You gave a clue by yourself. Got caught. Why all this? Is it to tell all this story to me? Many crooks’ lives have been ruined by me. But for the first time a good man was affected because of me. That is why I had to reveal my true identity. As usual I don't understand. This auto driver's wife's suicide has become a big issue. I have spoken to the press. It is not a big mistake for a person to die in hospital due to medical error. But it is a big mistake to have allowed it to become a news. Call the auto driver and talk about a settlement with him. Announce a big medical camp in that area. Select ten children and do free heart surgery. Arrange for that to come as a big article. Seeing this news, public will forget that news. Do you know what is the uncurable disease that our people have? Memory loss! That's why we are running the show successfully. -Darling. -Uncle. Take a trip abroad and enjoy. Business is not your cup of tea. -What is it? -Sir, green tea. -What is the noise downstairs? -It is from the TV in the lobby. -Is it a cricket match? -No, sir! It is "five Rs doctor's" interview. When I was five-years-old I had a head injury. I forgot everything in my life before that date. We lived near Thirunalveli in a small village called Serakulam. -Who is he? -Sir, he is Dr. Maaran. "Five Rs doctor". Recently shot to fame. It is when he went to present him the award that our Dr. Arjun in the magic show was... So, he is a magician. But at the same time from the way he handled the anesthesia professionally, he must be a doctor. -Kasi... -Bro! Are you getting angry? Bro... bro... My brother has consumed poison. Please come! -Where? -He is in the auto downstairs. Please, come! He is my pet son and I pampered him. Sethu, how could you do this? -I'm scared. -Doctor is here. He is unconscious. Come soon, bro! Hold him firm. -Bro! -Kasi! Look at his face once. Kasi... I must never see this face again in my life. -Pound his face to a pulp. -Okay, bro. Hey, give the hammer. -What happened? -Some insect. Must be a mayfly. Apply saliva, you'll be fine. Smash him. -You... -We'll meet. GPS information of the suspect's location is found. Double role, huh? What do you think of the entire police force? Okay, fine. I'll accept that it is two. One is here. Where is the other one? Sir, this is Dr. Maaran. His identity matches. We must confirm who is in front of you. If that is Maaran, who is this in front of me? Vetri... My mission is not still over. This is only the starting. To nab Vetri who escaped from police custody... four special teams have been formed under Commissioner Ratnavel. The police department has released videos taken during Vetri's interrogation. What do you want now? I haven't hurt anyone in my life until now. But for the first time in my life I feel guilty. I felt maybe I gave you the thought... that I used you. It is only to explain that... If you had wanted to squeal on me to the police, you could have done it in Paris itself. Those 15 days... I know you were worried about me. Give me just 15 more minutes. I'll give an explanation for everything. After that... you can call anyone. In this cleaning process, I need to finish off one last person. If I accomplish that... this entire corrupt system will become spotless. It'll pave the way to many changes. In this effort... I may or... may not return. Before leaving... I wanted to share something that I didn't share with you before. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Sister! -Dr. Maaran... You are no longer upset? Are you in good mood? May I know where this excess beauty is going? To drink a rose milk, it is coming to your area. -I'll call you back. -Okay. We missed our college bus. It is exam time. -Can you drop us on the way? -Please! -Which exam? -Economics. My God! What a fast girl! Hi, Maaran! Chairman of the Unimercy group of hospitals. -Vetrimaran? -No, I'm just Maaran. -Then where is Vetri? -I already informed the police I don't know anything about him. Sarala, your mother. Has gone to a temple in Mylapore. Your girlfriend Tara. Driving down beach road. But when a person like me enters the scene, definitely it is a serious situation, Maaran! A stranger is threatening me with a knife. -I'm so scared. -Mom, where are you? Heard your mother's audio. See the video of your girlfriend. Maaran... What are you going to do? The same confusion that everybody gets at the age of 30, right? Is it the mother or the girlfriend? Hey! Are you going to save them? Are you a Superman or Spiderman? You are just a family man, Mr. Maaran. At this minute only I can save them. Hey... Wait. Two lives are in danger there. Whether you lose your temper or I lose my temper, the loss is yours. What is this? Radial artery, right? If I insert the tip of a surgical knife and cut it! In five minutes your mom and girlfriend will be in hell or heaven. -Don't do this. -I want this. I want Vetri. When I bashed you he came to your aid. I'll thrash you now until he comes. Today your mom and girlfriend will return safe. Today they'll come. But tomorrow? -Mother... -Dear! Am I your only son? Yes, dear! -To father? -What did you say? Are you suspecting your father? He is lord Ram. I swear that there is no connection between that xerox and your father. Okay... Narrate clearly what happened that day. Let us see if we can get any clue. I have only one face in my memory. That is my face. But that was in front of me. He hit me and another chap carried me away. If only...If only I can find out who he is... -Is it pouring outside? -It is raining heavily. I locked up the clinic. Here is the key. -Do you need an umbrella? -I have got my sack. What is it? -You look tired. Take rest. -Yes, I'll leave. What is it? Kiddos, have they arrived? Yes, they are here. Let's go and play outside. Ratnavel, bow your head and come inside. You are a tall man. For a magician who expected us you should also know the reason. There are totally three grand wizards in India. -Stephen. -He is not alive. -Chandan. -No more. Salim Ghosh. That is me. Which means the only living Grand wizard in India. Two of us. One is me and the other is my son Vetri. He's the most mind-blowing magician in the world. Where is Vetri sir? -Why are you late? -Get lost! Working as your helper and his compounder is like churning my brain in mixer. Look here, Vetri. Look here. Someday I'll get both names mixed up totally. That day will be a doomsday for the both of us. Okay, bro. Don't get upset. -Maara, don't. -Move aside. You traitor! -You stabbed me behind my back. -I...? Sorry, bro! To hell with your sorry. Get up...get up. Who are you? I have to answer for the murders committed by you. Don't laugh. All those who want to kill you are chasing my family. Chill, buddy! -Maaran, don't hit.. -Tell me who you are. -Maaran, don't hit him. -Bro... What the bloody hell? Who are you? Before you find out who he is, first learn of your identity. He has defeated one more wrestler. Is there any other brave opponent here to oppose him? Is anyone gutsy there to defeat him? Come forward to take up this challenge. You are in your ninth month of pregnancy. You are walking in the middle of this male crowd. Are you not afraid? Who are you placing your bet on? Your elder brother or younger brother? Husband...my husband. -Boss. -Which place is he from? -Tamil Nadu. -Madrasi? No, he belongs to Madurai. -A city known for its bravery. -How will your Tamilian wrestle? Tamil...? You see now. To wrestle Ranveer here comes an opponent. -Watch your step, child. -My husband. The only bull that didn't yield in the Alanganallur bull taming event. As soon as the door opens he'll come, just watch. Here comes Tamil Nadu's Boss "Vetrimaran". Both contestants are ready. Sister, you never told me that bro is participating. -What is this? -He is like our evergreen hero MGR. He'll hit back only after he is beaten thrice. Ranveer... Ranveer... You said he'll hit back after taking three beatings. Now he has given four knocks. I'll fight for you! -Your brother is weak in wrestling. -Sister, he is weak only in math. He won't have counted properly. Bro! You have taken four knocks. -Show him your true colors. -I got hit only thrice. Four, bro. He is also gone. Vetrimaran is taking over. Super! Sister... Take care. -Bye, father-in-law! Bye, mother-in-law! -Ice... What is the signal that she is showing to you? -I have challenged my mother. -What? That I'll deliver one extra child more than her. How many siblings are there to you? Totally 19. With whose permission did you accept such a challenge? If you don't want, leave it. Don't say like that. Mother-in-law! Old sparrow, I have had only one child. You are celebrating like I've won gold in Olympics. Do I deserve this? If we have children, it'll benefit only our house. If you have children, the whole village will benefit. Boss, show the younger Thalapathy. Will everything be over? Yeah! The boys would have done a clean job. It'll be over. Hey, who are you all? What are you doing? Can't you see? -We are measuring the land. -For what? A factory is going to come up here. Why are they constructing it here? Oh God! Is this the way to hit? -Hey! -What? -Get tea and instigate boss. -Okay. Let boss come, I'll tell him to thrash you. -Give the shirt. -Here, bro. What is the problem? Look here... On realizing the mistake, it is not your conscience that you should give up... it is your uniform that you are wearing. -Come and have food. -I'll leave. Where are you running away? Oh God! The first ball is super. You can eat... eat alone. Where is my anticipatory bail? -Father! -Are you here? Come... come... -Ice... -Don't enter. Why are you getting angry? -Did you have a fight? -No...no. Ice, somebody tried to take charge in our temple land. I questioned him. They asked why they can’t take charge. I said it is wrong. They said okay and left the place. That's all. In your language -Game over. -Game over. Boss, how you created a ruckus in the theatre. Showed off in our panchayat. All detail I know. Ice, we have an internal spy wanting to break us apart. If I lay my hands on her... "The bat is hanging obliviously' Gopal looked up, obviously." Get lost. Only because I eat a bowl of porridge here... Hey, old sparrow! Mind it! What is the use of scolding you? Your mother hasn't raised you well. -If she had been here... -Grandma is dead meat, pa. -Don't deride my mother. -Your father kept roaming around. with a sword, muttonhead! -What son? -Grandpa is also kaput. If you deride my father, then I'll do 'tit for tat'. He is not an ordinary Singh. Father of 19 kids. A Cupid. Why are you deriding my father, huh? Smile... Ice... Why do you get angry for all this? If you keep such a sad face, how do I scold you? I'm scolding you and you are laughing. I may not know only if you swear at me in Hindi. But when we make love this boss can tell by your eyes. Fat hopes! Seeing this charisma only you fell for me. Not at all. I fell for your bike. Is it so? Do you know how I got mesmerized? Hey, is this how you talk with your son around? Fine, learn from my fingers. -Here... -Hey! -Here... -Yuck! I meant your eyes. My eye-catching beauty! Fat hopes indeed. You are our village politician. You should attend to our needs. But is it right if you are the problem? Hey, old man! Is this your father's land? Yes, man! It is my father's land. Happy with his plot of land and one bull my father donated it to our village. Fine we didn't know. -Hey! -Wait, bro. Then compensate us with the land near the pond. What will you do with that? We'll build a factory. We'll provide employment to all the villagers you see. -Won't our people benefit? -Of course. Do you all agree? You'll give a job and a salary. By converting our pond what will be our water source? Our illiterate forefathers dug ponds, built reservoirs, planted trees. You are trying to destroy all that, bloody fools! If you build houses on our ponds, how will rain water be stored? Won't it stagnate in the center of your house? Suppose we face draught for two years and we haven't stored water. What will you do? Will you beg from the next village? Hope that never happens. Listen to what I say. A village which buys water will never prosper. Boss, he is our leader. Don't let your tongue run. You call him a leader? Listen, a baby is born in ten months. It takes three years to become a graduate. For a doctor or engineer it takes four to five years. But for a leader to be molded, it takes a generation. We get only one leader for a generation. A leader isn't a mere word. It is a trust in totality of an entire generation. Don't sell it at any cost. Back off the same way you came. Or else you'll be utterly humiliated. Boss, let me see how you build a temple in this village. -Priest, do you have betel leaves? -Coming, bro. Here. I'll build a temple. Pooja for the temple will be held this Friday. First invitation is for you. Bring all your partners, friends and family. For a good meal. -Let's see how he'll build a temple. -What do you say, priest? We must check our almanac. -Priest... -Okay, agreed. Friday is auspicious. We'll start on that day. Then what? Start the preparations. The drum beats here should echo down the streets of Madurai. Where is my darling Ice? No sign of her, huh! Bro, our old sparrow. Go and ask her. Hey, old sparrow! Did you see my cool 'Ice'? You'll get it from me. What audacity! This old sparrow shows scant respect for you. Just say yes and I'll rip her feathers to pieces. Don't take her seriously. She'll come up with a nonsensical proverb. "A girl went to pick firewood. She landed with thorny alcoves instead." Go man! -Didn't I tell? -'Calling Boss Vetrimaran, come to the mango stall near the giant wheel'. Tell him to stop announcing. Don't broadcast like this. -What is it? -Get me mango. -What? -Mango. I have so much work to do. You call me all this way for mango. -Crazy wife! -I'm craving for a mango because of you. -You must only get it. -Why should I... Ice... Number two on the way. I have 18 more to go. To defeat my mother in the baby-contest. I was ready ages ago. -I'm fully aware of it. -Ice, sis, come here. -I'm coming. -Where are you running off to, love? To serve food to all the kids. We can flirt later. Another lion cub will be added to our family. The turban tying ceremony will start shortly, we request Boss Vetrimaran to come near the guardian deity Karuppa. I'll pray and be back. Kiddos, go out and play. We'll burst crackers now. Mother! Take the children out of that giant wheel. Get down...quick. Move back. Come...come on... Brother! Lord Karuppa! Go...go... Rush out. -Go, I'll join you. -Boss! Mother! -Brother! -Don't come. Selvi! We don't have the facilities. We must rush them to a well equipped hospital. Vehicle...vehicle... Where is the damn vehicle? Everybody gathered here, please don't worry. Our children will be fine. Doctor has arrived. He is calling all of you. Come. Come... Doctor, what happened? Sorry, what is their name... Selvi, Kalayan. Selvi and Kalayan couldn't be saved. Aiyo! My daughter... If you had brought them ten minutes earlier, I could have surely saved them. We live in a village 23 km away. How to get them in ten minutes time? What to do? Hospitals are only in cities. Then is it okay if villagers die? That is also true. But I don't have the answer for this. Sorry! We must have offended the Gods for this accident and loss of lives. Be happy about the survivors instead of lamenting over the dead. How old do you think Selvi was, brother? Around eight? Kalayan? Around 12? What mistake did they do? The only mistake those children did was being born in this village. Only pooling booths will seek us out. Nothing else. We have to go in search of what we want. Children should walk ten miles to go to school daily. If our houses catch fire, it takes half a day for the fire engine to land here. Even for an emergency we have to travel half a mile. This is the condition of this village. They'll get whatever they want with ease. We are not so privileged Because they are all living in the city. We live in a village. Well said, my lady. Only lord Karuppa comes to our aid. -We'll start the temple work immediately. -Yes. How'll a temple benefit us, bro? Can we get those children back? You heard what that doctor said. If we had come ten minutes earlier, he would have saved them. We must not build temple here. We must build a hospital. Boss, you are talking in anger. We can build a temple. But hospitals involve a lot of planning. Even the Government can't build it. What can we do? Be practical instead of divided opinions. Even if we have to sell all our assets we'll build a hospital here. Ice... If you have decided to build a hospital, I'll talk to my dean to carry it out successfully. He is also like you. He'll be the first person to help a good cause. Here after no one in this village will be deprived of medical aid. Let us build the hospital. Why are you hiding behind? Ice, call me if there is any problem. I'll stand right in front. This award and acclaim are not my cup of tea. -Won't set for me, Ice. -Won't set at all, Ice. -Stop making a fuss. -Go, bro... go. Do the honors. The doctor is here. Greet... -Sorry, you are... -Aishwarya Vetrimaran. Seeing the hospital, I got excited. I know. Junior. How... how can I? He is calling you, right? Go ahead, Ice. We fondly request Mr. Daniel Arogyaraj to come to the dais to speak a few words. A good news to all of you. Do you know what? For the first three months all of you can have free medical aid. Very soon I want to tie up with the hospitals in London to make free medical aid possible for all of you. This is my dream, goal and everything. I'm not the right recipient for all this applause. Your boss deserves it. -Get up and come for my sake, please. -Get up, bro. -Please come. -Your father will speak now. I... I don't know what to speak. These are my thoughts from the bottom of my heart. A man needs water to drink, food to eat, clothes to wear and place to stay. I thought all this will do to lead a decent life. But there is something more important than all this. That is our breath. Only a man who is alive will need all this food and water. Today in our village in the place of temple a big hospital is there. In place of deity our doctor is there. Like how God doesn't distinguish his devotees from being tall, short, fat, thin, dark, fair, rich and poor. Same way whoever walks into our hospital trusting us we should fulfill his expectations to his utmost satisfaction. I believe he'll fulfill my dream. That's all. What more can I say? We must approach a cardiologist. Patients have started pouring in. Mrs. Maaran, you'll deliver your baby in your own hospital. Indeed, Ice...? Shall we tell him about the documents? What is the matter? What is he saying? Let us talk later on. Doctor, tell me. Boss, our hospital requires a long equipment list. Like CS3000. Blood cell separator, Implantable cardio dent. defibrillator, Electro cardiogram. Scanners. We need to import all these from London. Only when they are bought in a doctor's name will we get subsidy. To explain in a way you'll understand, we can get in a lower cost. It is a good decision. Buy in your name. There is a small hitch. You hold the power of attorney of this hospital on behalf of the villagers. If it is in the doctor's name, it'll make our purchase easier. Is that all? Tell me what I should do. Sheshatri... If could just sign this document. Give it. I'll sign it. But I want just one promise from you. Not even one person should die in this village without medical aid. Then okay. Maaran sign! Our hospital is in great demand. Residents of Madurai, Dindukal and Vathalagundu come here. Patients think that our chief doctor is their lucky mascot. You are the sole reason. Thala... Hey, old sparrow! Regaining your youth, huh? Wearing cooling glass at home in broad day light. Showing off. She had her eye surgery in our hospital. Till I have the pleasure of seeing all your babies to-be born, I prayed to Lord Karuppa to give me proper eyesight. My favorite deity took your avatar and graced me with my vision. That's enough for me. Don't try to get me teary eyed with your sentimental stuff. You look as stylish as actress Padmini. Get lost! Sir, greetings! Every hospital we went to wanted to fleece us, sir. Without even charging me Rs one our doctor cured my father. You are God, sir! Daniel sir and doctors here saved your father, not me. Thank them and not me. Thanks a lot! What? You look very happy. Yes. When we help others the joy that fills our heart... We shouldn't stop with this. We must continue to build many more hospitals like this. No, we will build all over India. Building a hospital is easy. But we need good doctors like Daniel sir. How could you say this? We'll make our Maaran a doctor. Look, this hyper-baby inside, who kicks me day and night, we'll make him a doctor too. Superb! All our 18 babies will also become doctors. We'll give free medical aid all over India. It'll be a good scheme and I would have beaten my mother in the contest also. -Numbers don't tally. -What? India has 22 states, right? Even if it is one doctor per state, two are missing. Only two, right? We'll somehow make it up. Ice. Boss... Open the door of the maternity ward. Mrs. Vetrimaran has been admitted for delivery. Within half an hour she'll have normal delivery. This is her report. Why, doctor? -All her parameters are normal. -How do I come across to you? What's a normal delivery? Delivery today. Discharge tomorrow. They'll get married and joyously make babies. We'll take pittance and do a mid -wife's job, they'll leave happily. If it is a Caesarean, she has to stay here for ten days. Fees plus room charge. After 30 years do you know how this world is going to be? The world will write off a 'five rupees doctor' an incompetent. Let's charge an exorbitant fee of Rs 5000. They'll call as 'experts' and queue up with tokens. Specialized hospitals will crop up for different organs of the body. People will throng in each of these hospitals. Patients and invalids are our investments. It'll increase and increase. Everyone will be taught that this is the best way to live. He'll realize much later that he's an invalid only due to this life style. It is okay in others case. Why Vetrimaran? Isn't it a risk? Boss is the right guy for this. Now if it is a caesarean in boss's house, then all others will follow suit. They should just get used to a new habit, simple! I'll handle boss. Change the report and record it as umbilical cord prolapse. We don't have an anesthetist. Why can't you try it? Oh No! I don't know. She can be your guinea pig. Arjun! You were shocked when I said cesarean. Mark my word. In another 30 years, a patient will be shocked by 'normal delivery'. Arrange for a caesarean. Go. No. I had these same contractions during my 1st delivery. I can understand, Mrs. Maaran. But there is slight complication in this delivery. Umbilical cord is wound around the baby's neck. At the time of the delivery when mother pushes the child the umbilical cord might strangle the baby. Boss... See, we don't have any other option. Caesarean... Doctor, just tell me what I need to do. Nothing. You just sign this. Let us wait for some time. Dr. Arjun, whatever the procedure, 1st explain to the patient. Put her fears to rest. See this. This is the position of your baby. Look here. Around the baby's neck there is umbilical cord. So, there is no chance for normal delivery. Did you tell my husband? I have explained everything to boss. He accepted and signed. the consent. See... Now you must decide. Dr. Arjun, administer anesthesia. Bro, has sis been taken inside? Okay, there is change of clothes and biscuits for the kid. I'll go and inform old sparrow. I'll return with dinner soon. Okay, bye! Dad. When will Mom come? -She'll come soon. -What about baby bro? He too...he too... Till then you must remain silent like a good boy. Tell me a story in that case. What story can I tell you? -The Elephant story. -Elephant story? -Shall I tell my story? -Superb! This Ice... She is like an angel. Have you seen Goddess Lakshmi in the calendar in our house? She is that Goddess. Her skin you know... glows with a sheen. You know kids who don't shelter in a school when it rains? That is me. That day it rained heavily. I entered the college to take shelter. It is on that day I saw her. Only on that day Madurai was hit by a hail storm. Her eyes sparkling with a smile she was playing with her friends in the rain. That day I decided. If ever I marry only she'll be my wife. Otherwise I'll live like our bachelor God Anjaneya. I didn't give up at all. You bet I followed her like her eternal shadow. Then somehow I paraded myself and played pranks. I convinced your mother to say 'yes'. But her father, Mr. Singh showed his nasty side. Your Singh grandpa. The imbecile. -Idiot, huh? -He took your mother back to Punjab. -Oh God! -But your father went all the way to Punjab to win her hand. Then they slowly came around and reconciled. And you were born. Maara, do you know how you were born? In Punjab... In a village with no facilities. Out in the open, one afternoon. Sarees were held on all four sides and four random old women delivered you. Look at your little bro. Born with a golden spoon in your father's hospital. Expert doctors are waiting on him. In royal style like a prince. Doctor, doctor... The baby is dead, doctor. The baby is turning blue. What was the anesthesia dosage? Did you check her BP? -No, doctor. -You didn't do this basic... When will my little brother come? He'll come soon. He'll come. Keep it under observation for half an hour. If nothing negative happens... just tell them that it was still born. What kind of complication? There's a chance of epilepsy, right? Oh No! Immediately clear the baby. I don't know. Stay here till Kasi comes. Kasi...Kasi... I want to see Ice now. Do you want some biscuits? I want to see Ice. -Ice... -Maaran! Ice... Maara! Don't go there. -Ice...Ice... -Sorry! Ice! What's happened? What's wrong? Doctor! Ice... Everything is wrong here, boss. -What? -They have deceived us. This should be the last breath to die in this hospital. Let that be me. What are you saying? Ice... Don't leave me. Ice... Sorry, boss! Operation success. She got fits. That was the problem. Hey! What did you do to my wife? I don't know anything. Daniel is the cause for all this. It is he. Daniel! Not one of you will be here to face me. What the hell is happening here, huh? Our hospital is in great demand. Not even one person should die in this village without medical aid. Maaran, it's my responsibility. By selling all our assets we must build hospital in this village. -Maara! -Father! Hey! Maara! Maara...! Boss! It is wrong. You should keep up your word. Demolishing the hospital you worshipped as a temple. You claimed I was God and you are hitting me. Isn't it wrong? Boss, I like you a lot. Do you know why? We are alike. We share the same dream. We'll build. We'll build a hospital. We'll build in all villages. Your dream is for others 'happiness', my dream is for my own joy. Yours is service and mine is business. That's it. Let me break the suspense. You think that you built this hospital, right? It was my handiwork. I tried through the MLA to get this land, but you beat him up. But you planned a temple here. Unnecessarily two children lost their lives. I thought it'll halt your temple plans and I can take this land. But you built the hospital and fell into my clutches. You made my dream come true. Maaran, I'm saying this most genuinely. To kill you or your wife or your baby dying. All this didn't feature in my list. I tried a C-section instead of a normal delivery. It backfired. It's a medical trial error. I'm so sorry for that. Don't be angry, Maaran. If you meet Aishu in heaven, convey my apologies. Hey, you want to bury the truth. No one can do that. Two instead of one will take revenge on you. Daniel! Don't think our hands will always be lowered. One day... Some day or the other... Our hands will raise and speak. I performed a magical show in Dindukal 27 years ago. On my way back home I saw a boy unconscious clutching a new born baby. I adopted them. One was Vadivu and one was Vetri. He became my son. He turned into my disciple. He excelled even me, his guru. When I see both of you I'm reminded of my brother Boss Vetrimaran. Seeing his heart in you and his short temper in Vetri, my brother's face flashes in front of me. I'm running behind you only for that joy. You be the blessed one, bro. I decided I'll be the sinner. That's why I maintained my distance. Look! Police. You just cannot catch him. Sir, I think he is blind. Mania, you realized that only now? Sir, Vetri has been arrested. Just got the information that he is in Puzhal jail. Shesha, you take care of Maaran. I'll deal with Vetri. -Want to see the doctor? -Throw her out. Maaran, my uncle heads the Medical council this year too. I know the Health Minister supports you. Sign the withdrawal letter. What is this, bro? Why did you bring us here? Give us five minutes. Let’s see whether he agrees to sign. If not, we can rip his hands off. Vetri will be taken to the magistrate in 20 minutes. DC Ratnavel will be here. Please make it fast. It is that cell. -Take the files to the court. -Okay, sir. Hey, Vetri! Thirty years back a man with this same face stood before me. Within eight hours of claiming he would dissolve my dream... 'Our hands will raise and speak'. I ensured he vanished from the face of this earth. Who are you with the same face again? Danny dear, one good turn deserves another. but if it is a misdeed, it'll be double trouble. Vetri... Maaran... Maaran. Vetri. Look! Police. Then Shesha went to the clinic... Villain junior has gone there, huh? Why have you sent junior alone? Call him at once. I act after rattling my 'punch' dialogue for five minutes. He is 'less word, more blows' kind of a person. Tell me, uncle! Shesha, where are you? I'm getting the sign in Maaran clinic. Hey, it is not Vetri there. -It is Maaran. -Idiot! Don't be stressed and mix up our names. That isn't Maaran, you ass! VETRI. -Get lost! -What darling? Uncle on the line? Switch on to speaker mode. -Hey, Sheshu! -Danny darling! You put it on in speaker too. Hey, Vetri! -Or shall I stab your nephew? -Wait. Is my bro next to you? What’s up, bro? Bro, he was threatening to kill Tara and mother... -What was it? -Radial... radial artery. Am I right, friend? How will I know all that? Other than my knife. More or less I'll do my job precisely. Ask him to stitch it up soon. Wait! Vetri! I won't slice you. Show it to me. Stop! -Stop, Vetri! No! -Is that the right spot? Sheshu! Sheshu! Does it hurt? Your dearest nephew's life is in the palm of my hand. "Come my dear Danny boy." Vetri, don't hurt Sheshu. I'm coming. Drive to the hospital. Make it fast. Go to any hospital. I know where to take you, sir. Shesha! Vetri! Vetri! Go up and check. Hey! Vetri! Hey! Vetri! Where are... -When will we reach the court? -In another 10-15 minutes. Okay. What is this? Vetri Maaran. Maaran Vetri. I wanted to close both your chapters. But he is dead. Vetri. Hey, doctor bro... You should save your 'magician bro'. I have to kill both of you in one solid blow. -Hey! -Come...come... -Vetri! -Go...go... -Go...go... -Vetri! Vetri! Come on. Coming back from the jaws of death is nothing new for me, bro. -Punch dialogue, huh! -Superb! Kasi! He is such a pain. I'll handle him. How can you tackle him? Who said a doctor doesn't know to hit? Now you see the scene. Come on! Daniel, you want to bury the truth. Nobody can do that. Two instead of one will take revenge on you. What are you seeing? Why are you so dazed? I won't kill you. You brought a man into this world just to kill you. You'll die in his hands. Here you go. Five rupees. If you are still alive, bring it to my clinic. I shall save you with my own hands. Hey bro, he is all yours to finish. Hey, Vetri! Free Vetri... Free Vetri... You had a reason to remain quiet inside. Now is your turn to speak up. -Release Vetri! -Go ahead, my boy! Release Vetri! Release Vetri! I stood inside in front of so many witnesses. Now I stand in front of your conscience. You decide whether I'm right or wrong. Who gave you the rights to take away the life of so many people? Man has faith in two entities blindly. One is God. The other is doctor. We tonsure our heads as a vow to God. But we trust a doctor with our life. That doctor should not go astray. A criminal should not be a doctor. Misdeeds happen everywhere. But in the medical field it isn't a mere misdeed. It is treachery. There is no forgiveness for that betrayal. Who is to be blamed for the medical system turning into a business? Those who mismanaged the Government hospital scenario are the main offenders. Singapore levies seven percent as Goods and Service Tax. And still provides free medical aid. Levying 25% GST, why is our Government unable to provide the same free medical aid? 12% for medicine it seems. Liquor is the reason many women end up as widows and no GST for that. Our nation's No.1 Government hospital has no oxygen cylinder. Do you know why? Supplier has not been paid for the past two years. How do you like it? Another Government hospital. There was a power failure during dialysis. Four patients died. How humiliating! There was no power back up. A baby in an incubator died bitten by a Bandicoot. This can happen only in India. People are more petrified of hospitals than dying of strange diseases. Only that fear... are the investments of private hospitals? -Are you justifying murders? -I never killed. Who said so? Cleaning process of the medical system that's infected and corrupt. Poonkodi, a school kid was killed for monetary benefit. So many such brutal deaths. Still buried in secrecy. So many lose their near and dear ones without proper medical facilities. This pain is lodged in every common man's heart. Tell me now. Fair or unfair? -Very fair, sir. -Sir, what do you want? Free medical aid. There are thousand ways to earn money. But medicine is not the route. Till the last broker in the business is chased and bashed, my struggle will continue. Your parents were killed due to medical error. So is this a personal revenge? Greetings, bro! Bro! How can we eat this rancid food? Wave your magic wand and turn this into "Asif biryani". A man carried his wife's dead body 10 km... -from a Government hospital. -I've to watch this while eating now? This pathetic incident has taken place in Orissa. -This incident-- -Bro! Will he cry because his wife is dead? Or because he has no money for a proper funeral? As there was no one... Poor fellow! What the hell will they do with all this money? I'm in no mood to eat this food. To take proper action against the hospital... Bro! If only you were outside... wouldn't you have shown your act? Bro...? Hello! -I, V. Maaran solemnly affirm... -"I, V. Maaran solemnly affirm..." -...to head the Indian Medical Council. "-...to head the Indian Medical Council." -And discharge my duties duly. "-And discharge my duties duly." Without any fear or favor. Affection or ill will in my endeavor. "Without any fear or favor. Affection or ill will in my endeavor."
