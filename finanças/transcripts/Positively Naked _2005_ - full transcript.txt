Spencer tunick: Okay, put your legs together. There you go. Gwenn: You almost ready? - Do you have any hair stuff? - No. What kind of a girl are you? We have the opposite relationship of most people. I'm ready. You're doing your hair. Here I am in a hotel room with a man that I've known a month and a half. - Strange man. - It's the first time I've ever slept with him. You don't have to worry for me. I'm a good boy. Perfect gentleman. I thought they were going to give US two double beds. Let me get my gloves. All right, let's go. Let's do it. I can't believe I'm doing this. It's because you love me. Yeah. Gloves. Vinny gets about 60 pills a day, I only have one handful a day. Vinny's nervous about showing his belly to the camera. Four cameras and two tripods. - How do you feel? - Uh... I'm ready. I'm hoping to see a few guts-- that will make me feel a little more comfortable. With all of this going on, I forgot to be nervous that I'm going to get naked on camera. I was actually hesitant to tell my friends because I thought they would think I'm a sucker. Julia: This is kind of an out-of-the-way place. What do you think? Looks kind of creepy. I wanted to be at peak physical condition for this. I don't know what they are going to do. Put US all in a room and tell US to strip, I guess. Let's do it. Come on. Wow, this is cool. Oh my god. Look at all these people. Oh my god. Elizabeth: I thought I could do it right away, because I thought it was only going to be women. But then when I got there, that's when I find out that it was going to be males and females. As we all know we're going to be nude during this installation. Oops. Mark: Vinny really didn't want to do it. Vinny: I was an underwear model, but to wear nothing? - Spencer. Hi, Nicholas. - My name's Nicholas. Ron: I was a little nervous, a little apprehensive. When Spencer came in-- I don't know-- something about his voice. I'd like to thank everyone for coming. Ron: He was very nice with the crowd, and he kind of explained how he was going to do things and I became comfortable. This is a collaboration between you and I. We're going to make a piece of art together. At times it will be awkward and then at times it will be the exact opposite. You'll feel like you should have been here nude before. But your breakfast will never taste the same. In my life I've dealt with a lot of scary situations, so why should I be afraid to disrobe and display my little fellow in front of a room full of people? This is an honor to be here working with you. For me this is a sign of community. Julia: I participated in this installation despite the fears I had-- physically being naked in front of people? - Yeah, we could pose together. - I love that. No. Seriously. I'm going to be surrounded by all these men. This was an opportunity to do it in such an incredible way, in a celebratory way, with a community that shared something so critical about my life that they shared, which was HIV. Have you ever stood up on the counter naked before, Sean? I had come into the office and was talking to Walter about the cover prospects for the 10th anniversary issue, and none of them excited him or excited me. We kind of wanted something special. I had seen Spencer's work and I thought, "oh god, that would be perfect." Spencer: They wanted a work that everyone was alive, interacting with the camera and defiant. And I wanted that too, but I also wanted to create a relationship between life and death. I could be up here. Sean: I thought that it would be powerful for the people who participate. I knew it would be a powerful image. I was thinking as a magazine guy. We wanted a good image on the cover. They called US with about a three-week deadline they were working within. And most of the time to pull together Spencer's installations takes three, four months at the very minimum. I was like, "we've got to do this. I'm going to do it at no charge. I'm going to donate my services." In two-weeks time we get nearly 100 people willing to say not just that they're HIV, but here they are. Yeah, we came down from Boston. We live in Boston. This is the film I'm using today. Ron: For me, participating in the installation was the first time I've ever made a public statement that I'm HIV positive, that I'm a person who has survived with the HIV virus for 17 years. We all aren't dead or dying. A lot of US are survivors. Shawn: I'm in a room full of people who are HIV positive. I'm with my peers, you know? There's no need to be scared. I belong here. People who have dealt with the same situation with HIV that I have, going through the fear of "who can I tell? Which friends can I tell? I don't want to burden people. I don't want to go to my doctor. I don't want to make the appointment. I don't want to take the drugs. I don't want to do this and that." Just knowing, without even talking to everybody in the room, just looking at somebody and knowing, "yeah, they know what I've been through because they've been through it too." Loosening up. Yeah, I'm loose. I'm getting behind you. Spencer: We're going to be working back here or from here, from this angle. The idea was suddenly growing and it looked like it might happen. So this little voice in the back of my head said, "are you crazy? You're going to have to do this. Are you crazy?" Spence: I feel that Spencer's work is so important as a social comment, especially this. Every person in that room that was participating was there for a spiritual and emotional reason. That's his grandmother. She raised vinny and she... There aren't a lot of times that comes off, but I guess for today it's coming off. Shawn: A funny thing happened at the shoot. There was a guy there who was HIV negative, and he asked Spencer, "what about people who are HIV negative who are here in support of people with HIV?" Who is HIV negative? Shawn: Spencer was like, "I just want to get people who are positive right now." Okay, "neggies," finally you're the ones getting kicked out. Gwenn: I don't really have fears so much anymore. I think in the beginning of the relationship I definitely had concerns. I knew better. I knew I wasn't going to contract HIV. I knew how to use a condom effectively. I knew we really did everything in the relationship to keep me safe. I knew about all the studies about relationships like ours where the negative partner stayed negative. We've been in this relationship for five and a half years, and I feel like "I'm still negative, obviously what we are doing is keeping me safe," so I don't have those fears so much anymore. All your bags, all your backpacks, every single thing you brought with you, please give to the people behind the counters. - Woman: We need four bags right here. - Okay, sure. Elizabeth: When I was sitting there I was very nervous. The fellow that was sitting next to me, he kept holding my hands saying, "you're going to be okay. Don't be afraid. Don't get nervous. You're going to be okay." He encouraged me so much that when they said three-- "one two three," and it was time to take your clothes off, I just took everything at once, and I was like, "okay, this is it." You may disrobe now. Thank you. Oh my god. Julia: Come on, you've got to get undressed. - Got to go. - You and me, just you and me. Julia: This is not real. This is not happening. Shawn: Once everybody took off their clothes, the majority of the people in the room were naked. It sort of became, "oh, this is normal." Of course, at first you're checking people out. "Thank god there's somebody here whose a little chubbier around the sides than me." It was so sad that-- the penis thing. Okay, I'm a gay man. I know I'm fixated with the size... Of the penis. But particularly-- I didn't want mine to look particularly little, and it was kind of cold in there. So I wanted to have like the respectable, normal, middle-sized, don't-pay-attention-- Spencer: Dark hair, right here... Stand up. Yes, you can stand up. - All the way up? - Yep. Elizabeth: At the beginning I was nervous. A few minutes later, I was like-- everybody was walking around naked and nobody was looking at anybody. Spence: I was just walking around. I joked with one of my friends that was there. I said, "I'm going to run to the deli. Do you want anything?" He's going, "well..." Then I started for the door without any clothes. He's going, "wait a minute. You can't go out. You have no clothes on." One, two, three. Okay, were going to try for this. We're gonna-- everyone look at me. One... Close your eyes. Two... Open your eyes. Three... Keep them open. Elizabeth: I had ended this relationship that I had for a couple of years with this man, and I heard that he was sick, but I had no contact with him-- he had left the county. He had gone back to his family. When he tested positive, he had promised the doctor that he was going to come to tell me, and he never did. In the hispanic community, it's a culture thing. It's very common that a man will have sex with another man and not consider himself a homosexual. They don't consider themselves bisexual either. I think that was the reason why he kept the secret. And he was ashamed to come and tell me that the way he had acquired the virus was through sex with another man. At the same time, he got me infected. Spence: Every time Spencer asked US to close our eyes, each time I thought about one of my friends. I've probably had 40 or 50 friends die since 1981. And I said to myself a small prayer inside, "this is for you. This is in honor and memory of you." Elizabeth: I decided to tell my son that I was HIV positive. He was 12 years old. I went into his room, sat on the floor with him, and I started talking about all the things that we had done together, how close we were to each other, how much he meant to me and that I had a secret. I asked him if he knew what HIV was, so he said, "yes, I know. They told US at school." I said, "well, I want you to know that mommy has HIV." And I told him how I got the virus, what had happened and that I was telling him because I felt that he was old enough, that I didn't want to have any secrets and that we had to spend more quality time together. He didn't cry a lot, but I remember tears coming down his face. And I've got no answer for him. He was just listening to me. It was the worst day of my life. I cried all night. Spencer: Thank you so much. This is really nice. Man: Gorgeous. Spencer: Look at each other not at me. Look at each other. Sean: Participating in the installation and getting naked, I don't think I could have done it unless it was a group of other people who were HIV positive. That gave me a strength and a sense of community. Elizabeth: I have so many changes in my body due to the disease that I was kind of ashamed of showing my body, but then I felt comfortable. Vinny, which was tougher, the belly or showing the penis? Oh no, the belly. It's really tough for vinny, because he has trouble moving around. He feels very self-conscious. He feels that maybe if he could do a little more yoga the belly would go away-- and it wouldn't go away. He's not fat. It's not anything he can get rid of. It's aids-related lipodystrophy. It's a redistribution of lipids fat around your organs or around body parts, such as "the buffalo hump," the hump that's on the back of your neck. I have a hump on my back between my shoulders. I have a big neck, big belly, very very skinny legs. Everything is due to the different protease inhibitors that I have been on. The fat in my body has gone to the wrong places. Even the most gorgeous buff gym-body there that had HIV spends a lot of time thinking about that distended belly and thinking about those distortions in another person, and has a lot of empathy for that because they see that in their own future. And yet here we all knew that we shared certain fears, we shared certain feelings about our bodies and that collectively we could-- we could help heal that. Spencer: Very still. Shawn: It was a unique moment too, to just forget for a moment that you're HIV positive because you're worried about being naked and about, "am I going to rub somebody the wrong way? Where's my elbow going back there? Sorry, man." I think everybody in the room at one point completely forgot about being HIV positive even though that was the reason they were there. Spencer: Okay, here we go again. Stay still. Julia: When I was diagnosed I didn't react in any particular way. I was already an addict. I was trying to kill myself slowly, so-- that was kind of like, "well, this is what you want." It didn't require I do anything more. I didn't have to take any more pills, if you will, or cut my wrists. I was miserable for years. I'd been so depressed for so long. I have a history of sexual abuse and that has colored my whole sense of self and my body image for years. I haven't been able to come out from behind that. I wanted to be proud of who I am, and I wanted to find out and figure out how to bring that pride back to my family. It's a pretty tall order because being this woman, this trip means so many things. It means you're living with HIV. It means you have a history of substance abuse, prostitution, HIV. It means all those things. But it also means a person of strength. A person with a past, yes, but a person with a future. A person with some hope, strength, love-- that's what it means to me. Spencer: Okay, look here. Very good. Don't move. Everyone, close your eyes. One... Open your eyes. Two... great. Ron: I think that everyone probably felt a sense of camaraderie. We're all naked, we're all here, we're all positive, but we're all different in some way. Mark: We were married about 10 years ago. We petitioned the Vatican in Rome, and we actually got our papal blessing. Mark proposed at cafe Rafael, which is just around the corner from here. I got down on one knee and had a big, oversized plastic engagement ring. There we have our cake top. I remember saying, "oh my god, get up. Get up." "Will you--?" "I said get up." And then you finally said yes. - Yeah. - And then I got up. Our marriage has lasted longer than some of the straight marriages in our family, so-- I do not have aids. I'm HIV positive. I've been HIV positive for 20 years. - Vinny, you've been HIV...? - Positive for 14 years. - And...? - And aids for 10. Mark: The difference between HIV and aids is a somewhat imaginary but very important boundary between being HIV-positive and healthy and having "full-blown aids." If you get less than 200 t-cells in repeated blood work, then you have aids. When I was first diagnosed with HIV, I thought-- well, there was no such thing as HIV in 1987. It was aids-related complex, a.R.C. Or whatever-- and I thought I would die. I thought-- I was waiting to die. My planning window became very short. I stopped buying new clothes. Who's going to need 'em? The annual check-up at the dentist's office-- hey, why waste my time with that? I didn't tell anyone for five years either. Nobody. I could not tell anyone. Oh god, back in those days, lovers were leaving one another. Neighbors were freaking out. Families were freaking out. I had three roommates. I didn't know how they would deal with it. I didn't know how to share it with them... So I kept it to myself. I had friends that I had told around the same time, and they wouldn't let me touch their kids. You know, there were babies-- big large Italian family. I remember somebody walked by and snatched a kid out of my arm or wouldn't let me eat from their plates. I went through-- I estranged myself from them for years because I couldn't, you know-- I couldn't deal with their phobia. Spencer: The person next to you, go-- stay on the chair. And the person next to you go up on the counter. So, boom boom boom. Yes, on the counter. Everyone just falls and drapes. Even if you fall off onto people, it's going to be just like-- like noodle soup. All right. Here we go. One... Two, three... Drop. Very good. Very good in the front. Very good! Here we go. Um, right over here, could you cover your special portions? Shawn: I grew up in waynesboro, Virginia, and when I was tested for HIV it was 1987. I was in the sixth grade. My parents wanted to get me tested because so many people in the hemophilia community were testing positive for HIV because of the blood products. And when I was tested, it came back positive. One of the first people my parents told was my sixth-grade teacher, because I had been missing a lot of school, because I was getting sore throats that I couldn't really get over. My teacher, she had some concerns about HIV transmission. She wanted to know if I was a risk to the other students, so she went to her doctor. And her doctor was either on the school board or had close connections with the waynesboro school board, and I was expelled from public school. I was allowed back in just because my parents battled them-- with lawyers who told them it was illegal, with doctors who told them, "Shawn is not a danger to the other students. He's not going to be running around having unprotected sex during science class." You know, a lot of the fears were so irrational. A lot of people in my community who thought they didn't have to deal with it realized "this is out there." Spence: I heard my parents and their peer group say that aids was a god-given death wish against homosexuality, so I was scared to say anything because they truly did believe that. If you're going to tell a friend, "I have cancer," that friend will feel sorry for you. "Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, she has cancer. She's going to die." If you're going to tell this person, "oh, I have aids." The person will just look and say, "oh my god, what did she do?" I mean, "she deserves it." Ron: I'm single. It's difficult-- the disclosure factor. How do you tell the person? How is this person going to react? I once had an attorney who was in a group with me. He and I had just this terrible... Debate one night. He told me that the "last clear chance" doctrine obligated me to disclose my status to people automatically, and I disagreed with that. I told him that safe sex is an individual responsibility. If I meet a person in a sex club, I'm not going to raise the issue because people don't go to sex clubs to hear about people's statuses. However, I have been asked in a sex club, and I've disclosed. I don't have a problem if the question is asked of me-- no matter where it is-- but I'm not going to volunteer it in certain situations and I don't think it's necessary. I think if you want to know, then you'll inquire. Spencer: Keep still. Very good. Now if you can all look at each other now. Is everyone okay? This is going to be great once this happens. Okay, there you go. That's perfect. Okay, that's good. That's very relaxed. Sean: We focused so much on giving back the possibility of survival to people with HIV, which is unbelievably important, but it has contributed to the erosion of the message that HIV is a really bad thing. It messes up your life. You don't want to get it. There are actually people that believe that these drugs are so progressive that even if they did get HIV, it doesn't concern them anymore. They'll just take drugs and they'll live a full life. Who cares? Spence: Okay, don't move, very still. Barbara: People are so lax and so cavalier, which is how I got HIV in the first place-- was because this was somebody else's disease. When my boyfriend and I got back together in 1988, we discussed the idea of safe sex. We decided we don't have to worry about safe sex because this is a gay men's disease, this is for I.V. Drug users. What do we have to worry about this for? Well... hello! He had full-blown aids. He had been walking around with it much longer than me, and he passed on in '92. And my doctor told me over the phone that my test results came back positive. First of all, I thought I was going to drop dead within six months. I started planning my will. Then I called up a couple of friends of mine and told them I wanted to plan my funeral. Everything was just so self-conscious to me. I just felt like a walking lethal weapon. Okay, when you're dropping this time, don't drop like you're sitting. Drop like you're lying. Okay? So you're not propping yourself up by an arm, and feel free to recline on someone you know-- or don't know. All right, one, two, three. That's fantastic. That's-- oh, this is great. This-- oh, this is nice. Shawn: Two years after I was diagnosed with HIV my mom brought up the topic of starting treatment for HIV. She was getting a lot of pressure from my doctor. A.z.t. Was the only one that was around until '95 or so. There were a couple of others, but that was just to prolong your life a little bit. I watched people suffer so horribly and I've had several people die in my arms. It was just horrendous, these painful deaths with cancers all over-- black and blue all over their arms and faces, these beautiful, sweet, wonderful, giving people. In 1994 the protease inhibitors came, so I've been on crixivan, invirase, sustiva, kaletra, viread, videx-- I mean everything. So it would be novir and fortovase, videx and viread, those are the... The antivirals. And then there's all the rest of this stuff that I take. All these wonderful meds. When combination therapy came out-- and... I am as extraordinary an example of someone who has benefited from that as I know-- I would say within three days of starting the pills I knew I was getting better. It was like my body had been a swimming pool full of virus, and someone had pulled the plug and every day more and more of it was being drained out of me. A lot of people are still alive due to the cocktail, and there are plenty of people that I know that are over 20-years positive that never even had to take a drug yet, so each person is different. Are there any people that are couples here? I would like whoever is a couple to embrace-- as you have been. Mark: The best news you can get is to be told you're going to die and then not die, because when you realize that then you go, "oh shit, I had all these screwed up things. I was worried about the mortgage and I wasn't worried about spending time with my family." Nobody ever dies and goes, "oh, I should have been working more." They always go, "I meant to do this. I should have been writing. I wanted to do this." And when you are hit over the head with "you are going to die," it refocuses things. I think that's one of the reasons vinny and I have had such a wonderful relationship, because we keep on being told, "you know, you might not have much more time together so you better make the most of it." It's hard. I promised that i'd out-live him though. I thought he might not make it through when I was in the hospital and he was being taken care of by the nurse and he was having a bad spell. But now, once again, I'm the healthy one and vinny's doing pretty good too. I'm not doing bad. So... I get a little sad though. How come? I just do. It's okay. Spencer: I just want to thank everyone. It's been so nice. Thank you. - Awesome. - Nice meeting you. - Thank you. - Thank you. It was a good job. You did a great job. - I think it was a wonderful experience. - Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thank you. I really appreciate you coming. Thank you. Mark: I think it was about half an hour longer than what you were really up for, - but you got through it. - Yeah. My heart jumped when Spencer asked me to stand on the countertop, but once I crossed that threshold I could have done anything in there. I think we've got a cover. I like right here, what's happening right here. Right back there. - Assistant: Which one's that? - Right. This is a wonderful moment for me, so thank you. Woman: You should just be beside yourself. - It's just amazing. - I'm very happy with it. I'm excited. This was great. Elizabeth: I felt that doing this installation, it was to show the world we are alive. We are suffering from the disease. We have to face challenges everyday. Ron: I think we were kind of communicating to one another, you know, that "I'm here with you. I'm here for you. We're all in this thing together." Julia: I think the message is that HIV-aids affects all people of all ages, of all colors, from all walks of life, that we're living and thriving, that, in fact, we don't look any different from anyone else and that it could be you. Spence: The shoot was a divine moment for me. I tactilely could feel the presence of Kenny and kerry, Tony and all these different people-- they were there. That gives me peace. Period. So if I die right now or tomorrow or next week, I'm going to die very happy and very blessed. Sean: Feeling your mortality enables a clarity of focus. You learn about friends, you learn about real love, you really get an understanding of what unconditional love means. You also learn that everybody is going to die, and everyone knows that, so that isn't news to anyone. So it isn't about having information, but it's about learning it and experiencing it in your life and realizing it. That makes the time we have while we're alive precious and important. For, I think, a lot of survivors of aids, it's given them the inspiration and even courage to make their lives important and to have meaning.
