Well I'll tell you something, you can just take a piss on one of those Hollywood stars. I wouldn't diddle you with your daddy's dick! How much you want to spend? About 20 bucks? You have a good night. Hey all's I wanted to do was borrow it, not buy it. Genuine peacemaker. It's a gift from Tom Mix. These are really nifty, Kit. Great balance. It's lucky for you you got those fake bullets of yours in there, or I'd have to haul you in. I know what I'm doing, deputy. My pappy didn't raise no turnip farmer. Take care, cowboy. - Goodnight boys. - Good to see ya. Goodnight. Hey Dick, who's Tom Mix? Well, sweet thing. What's your name? Angel. Well, Angel. I thought you and me could have us a little party, huh? I bet you would. Look mister, I'm underage. Or are you one of those perverts that gets off on little girls? We're a little touchy, aren't we? Look, why don't you just drop me off on that corner? I see a friend over there. Look, I didn't do anything. Thanks for the ride, officer. What makes you think I'm a cop, honey? If you're not a cop, then what are you doing with this? Here, call the station. Angel! What, goddamn freaks! Happening to this neighborhood? I hate those, sweetheart, don't let fatso go yet. Why don't you go home now and spank your monkey, numbnuts? Sweetheart, I thought they busted you. I had porky made out the minute I got in the car. Good. Didn't I have the best teacher? You better believe it! Come on, let's get another ice cream cone. Ah keep going, here we go. This is your correct address, both of you? - Yeah. - That's right. Okay I'll give you a break this time, but don't let me catch you working the boulevard again. Thanks. Hey. Aha, lieutenant! What do you say, Collins? Looking good! Hey it's good to have you back, man. See they're keeping you busy, huh? Yeah, you'd think with a psycho on the loose these girls would stay off the streets. Collins, nothing stops the action. If a tidal wave hit this street, the hookers would bob up like a bunch of corks. You got that right, lieutenant. Guess you're investigating the hooker murders, huh? The way he chopped up those girls? This guy is one sick son of a bitch. What I can't understand is, what makes that sleazebag tick? Well? Figure he was dumped by his old man when he was a kid, his mother probably sexually abused him. We know he's a necro, probably bisexual, possibly impotent. My guess is he wants to get busted. Whatever the case, pal, he's out there somewhere cruising this fuckin' boulevard. Ooh, salt and pepper. You operated that kid yet? No, but I've seen her around a lot. She keeps her nose pretty clean. You really know this area pretty well, don't ya Collins? Yeah, well I've worked around here a lot of years. How'd you like to get outta those rags and help out? Who me? I thought you'd never ask! Good. Try to get rid of that. I'll be back for it later. Two blind lesbians lost in a fish market. That is crazy, get it? Hey Crystal, you know those stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame? My dad installed a lot of 'em. Sure he did. No really, really. He was a terrazzo stone artist. When I was about five, he took me to the dedication ceremonies and he propped me up on his shoulders so I could see all the movie stars. That was the best time of my life. Hey, you kids should've seen Hollywood Boulevard. Then it was a boulevard something to see. Now it's a toilet! An ulcer, that bum is gonna give me an ulcer! How's your mama, Angel? Oh she's much better and she loved your soup. So does that bum, son of a bitch. I don't know about you ladies, but it's lean out there tonight. It's the murders, Mae. Even the johns are scared. Why should the johns be scared? It's the hookers gettin' killed. Ever see a man try to run away with his pants wrapped around his ankles? I don't know about you girls, I wanna get the hell outta this town. Go somewhere where there's clean air, where I can breathe. I dunno, maybe Tahiti. Tahiti, why Tahiti? Because the men use their dicks for oars. Ooh. Goddamn it, Mae. Fay and Sherry aren't even cold in their graves yet, and you can't stop with the jokes. You ever hear anybody whistle in the graveyard? Don't tell me no money. You call that more, man? You sit out before, and don't come back! At least the hookers, they got money, they pay! - My dear. - What? Relax! Puff on this, huh? I never saw it to fail. Give a man something to suck on, and he's happy. Come, off we go. Come on, let's go back to work. Okay, let's go by the theater this time. Okay. Give me some. You know what it says here? It's ridiculous. - Hey. - What? I'm gonna go see Yoyo. Okay, 'cause he's so cute. Yeah I know. I'll see ya. I'll see ya tomorrow. I have to study after this. - Okay, bye-bye. - Bye. Mae West liked it. I used to do it for her all the time in her bedroom. You like that? Wait, wait, there's more. Next show in a half an hour. Thanks folks, your donations will go to a worthy cause. My survival! Good show, Yoyo. Thanks, Kit. Goodnight. You have a nice evening, Crystal. Thanks, Kit. Goodnight. Oh, hi Crystal. Hi. Boy you look great. Thank you. I was with Kit and we, you look great. You really look good, I mean it. I mean I guess I look great huh? So how's, so how's business? It's kinda like you, Yoyo. Up and down. Oh. Get it? Yeah. Oh wait, let me show you this new trick. Okay. Let me show you this. Hold out your hand. Like this? Oh, that's beautiful! It's yours. - Thanks, Yoyo. - You're welcome. Maybe I'll see ya after work? You can bet your top on it. Bye. Bye. Ooh, just what I like. Nice and strong. Come on. We're gonna have us a real nice time. I bet you can't guess what I do in the daytime. I go to school. I'm studying to be an accountant. I got straight As on my report card. Oh, this is the place. It's right over here, it's number four. Hey you know, I'm into astrology. I bet I could do your sign. He's out like a light. Hey you think we should untie him? That was the easiest hundred I ever made. Whoops, I forgot my panties, girl. Don't bother, the old buzzard probably ate 'em. Hey, you know I thought he was dead at first? We woke up lucky. Shh. Now this here is called a tombstone twirl. Yes sir, learned that trick from Tom Mix. Used to double 'em in all of his pictures. Matter of fact, I worked with most of the old western stars. Let's see there was Ken Maynard, there was Buck Jones, there was William... Okay, I gotta a .45 finger in your back, partner. One false move, and you're a goner. Why you slippery little sidewinder, you went and snuck up on me again. I should've known it was you two. Here you go, sonny. Hang that on the wall and tell 'em you got it from Kit Carson in person. Now. - Damn pygmies. What are you doing out so late? It's past midnight and it's time for you to be home in bed. Well, I was heading that way now, partner. You ladies mind if I escort you? Thank you. Say, Angel. - What? Did I ever tell you about the time your pappy and me got thrown out of the Brown Derby? Yeah, but tell me again. I like that one. Or was it Musso and Frank's? I'll tell you, when you've been around as long as I have, the old memory begins to dim like a campfire at sunrise. I'll tell you, we tipped a few, your pappy and me. I bet. I miss him. So do I. Goodnight, Kit. Goodnight, Angel. - Come on, Mae. - Come on. Oh Angel. Get yourself a good night's sleep, you hear? I will. - Night ladies. - Goodnight. How about a little drink, my dear? Say a glass of 100 proof milk, huh? Hey! Girls! Come here! Bring out the spray, my dear. I hear a cockroach. Shall we investigate? Oh, she's painting by numbers again. I wanna show you my latest masterpiece. I call it fruit with gun. I call it shit. What do you know about it, fagele? You don't even wear the right clothes. The hell are you talking about? This dress cost me over 600 bucks. Hey Solly, where'd you get the cannon? What are you crazy? This is no toy! And for your information, I bought it today. Why, bear season isn't even open yet. This psycho killer shows, I'm gonna blow his fuckin' head off. Hey, you wanna play a game? Why not? I'll break out the board. Oh hey, I gotta go study. It's getting late, Mae. Goodnight. Goodnight honey. - Goodnight Solly. - Goodnight darling. Sweet dreams. - Thanks. Have you noticed our little Molly is growing up? I've noticed that you've noticed. Now you keep your hands off her. Listen, why don't you take that thing out of your pants before you blow your balls off? All eight of them. Who is it? Solly! Just wait a second, Solly. I'll be right there. Morning, darling. Good morning, come on in. It's rent time. Oh gee, I almost forgot. I was just serving breakfast to my mom. I'll have her write you a check. I'll be right back. Here you go, Solly. Oh, thank you darling. My mom says to say hello. And how is your mother? She's improving. - Receipt. - Oh great. I gotta go dump the garbage. Have a good day. - Later darling. - Bye. Northup, Northup, rah rah rah! Five, six, seven, eight! V-V-V-I-C! T-T-O-R-Y! Victory, victory for Northup High! Hey, look who's coming. You're always bragging about all your scoring. Here's one you haven't even touched. Oh ye of little faith. Center the fuckin' ball, man. All right, Rick, on three. Set, two, three! Touchdown. Come on baby, no applause? Look, I hear you're really smart, and I was wondering if you could help me with my homework. Then I'll give you something you can really applaud. Gee Rick, I'd really like to help you. But I have better things to do. Woo, Romeo! Romeo Ricky! Miss Allen? Molly, is that you? Yeah. Oh I'll be right with you. Just get this apron off before I get covered with paint. You are looking terrific! How's it going? - Good, good. - Good. You wanted to see me? Yes, why don't you have a seat right there? Is there something wrong, Miss Allen? No, not a thing! I just thought it'd be nice to have a little chat. What do you say? - Okay. - Great. Well, you know Molly, I'm just a little curious about something. I see here that you're not taking part in any of the social activities at school, and I was just wondering, are you having difficulty making friends? No, not at all Miss Allen. Well Molly, your parents are paying a great deal of money to see that you have the very best education. Well I don't understand. I'm on top of the honors list. There's more to life than getting straight As. That means excelling outside of the classroom as well as inside, you understand? Yes. It's my mother. She's had a stroke, and she's paralyzed. Oh, Molly, I didn't know. I'm so sorry. So you see, I don't have time for school stuff or clubs and stuff. I have to go home right after school and take care of her. I understand. Will you do me a favor? If you ever have need to talk, or I can help in any way, would you call me at that number? Okay. Promise? Promise. Okay. Thank you Miss Allen, I appreciate it. Okay. 1247, 1247 meeting the officer at 77 station. 1247, 1247 meet the officer at 77 station. 933 clear. I was supposed to meet her today, and when she didn't come by I... How long did you know her? Not very long, she was new in town. How can anybody do a thing like this? Can you prove where you were yesterday evening? Yes sir. Okay. What's that you've got there, son? Who is it? It's me. Hi Mae. What's wrong? Oh, baby. It's Crystal. What's wrong with Crystal? Did you take a look in there? It looked like a slaughterhouse! There's blood everywhere! There was blood on the walls, on the ceiling, the rug was sticky with it. It looked like Custer's last stand without the fuckin' Indians! Folks, would you settle down please? Hey, hold it! What's the problem? Three of our friends are dead! That's the problem, now what are you gonna do about it? We're gonna do the best we can. That's not good enough, obviously. You catch this son of a bitch, lieutenant! Excuse me, ladies, and we'll hang the bastard! We're bringing in more men and putting out extra patrols. The rest is up to you. I mean you ladies of the night. Be careful on the street, watch yourself. Work in pairs if you can, and for Christ's sakes, stick to regulars. Are you nuts? What do you know about our business? No matter how insignificant or trivial it appears, it could be important. Please phone. Take it. Thank you fearless fa's dick. I had a john that has a travel agency. He told me that if we go to Tahiti in December, you get 20% off. Tahiti in December? Bitchin! You know what else is that if we go as family? Yeah. Which is sisters, right? We get 50% off. Oh wow. Hey look, I got some brochures, check it out. It is so pretty, I gotta tell ya. Look in these brochures are great. When you said Tahiti I went... I think I see our down payment, I'll see you later. What are you waiting for, honey? Why didn't you take your clothes off? All right, you clean off the tables, you set up the chairs, and then you get your ass out of here. Yes sir, I'll do it right now. Ah, uh-huh. Thank you, thank you. Excuse me, miss. You were recommended to me. Wanna take a little break? Would you be interested? - Why not? A girlfriend and I share this room, here. Come on Lana, time's up. What's the matter, can't you talk with your mouth full? Let us in, we'll have a little menage a twat, huh? I think we'd better do this another time, definitely. Hey hold it! You're not going anywhere, cunt. Let go of my arm! Okay. Okay. Maybe this'll put a little smile on your face, hm? You better be 14, baby, or I'm gonna throw you back in for being too old. Now use your goddamn key. Why don't you go get cleaned up first? All right, baby. But you pour yourself into that bed, 'cause I'll be right out. What's wrong? Help me. Look at it, Angel. There must be something else you remember. Would you leave me alone? I told you all I know. It was dark, I couldn't see that well. What about his voice, his speech pattern, something he said? He was across the street. Is there anything else you can tell us? Yeah, he killed Lana, I can tell you that. Get this xeroxed, put out an APB. You got a pimp? You think I'm stupid? Stupid? Why would I think that? Hell, you've got everything going for you. You're young, attractive, healthy, and you're swimming around in a toilet bowl. It's my life! The hell it is. You think you're out there by yourself? I'm on that street too, goddamnit and every time I see a kid like you turning a trick, I wanna blow up the whole goddamn strip. Leave me alone, you're not my father! You have no right to judge me. You don't even know anything about me! How old are you? 15, 16? You know what happens to used up whores? They don't go to Leisure World, baby. They end up on hard shit or booze, and spend half their time in the slammer and that's just where you're headed. You're living in a dream world, baby. What you need is a good, swift kick in the butt. You think I'm proud of what I'm doing? I hate it, bunch of fat old slobs drooling and slobbering all over me? Sometimes I get so disgusted with myself I just think I wanna throw up! Then why do you do it? I have my reasons, and believe me I have no intention of doing this the rest of my life! What do you think this is, a game? You think you get away Scott free? Everything in life has a price on it, Angel. Whatever you do, you pay the price. Somewhere down the line, you're gonna have to pay. Then I'll pay! Then there was the Durango Kid. His real name was Charles Derek. Remember Sunset Carson? ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ Let it shine, let it shine ♪ Let it shine ♪ This little light of mine Toughest star I ever worked with was Franklin Fineham in Rough Gulch. Then there was that time I broke a leg in a movie. The Duke himself signed my cast. He was a tough one, did his own stunts. Well folks, I could go on all night, but it's getting late. I think I saw that on television last week. That was a good movie, too. The Indians came around, and they had a stagecoach... Lana's dead, Mae. I know, baby, I know. Come on, come on, let's go home. Come on, baby. You too, Kit. ♪ A band of angels ♪ Coming for to carry me home And I'm telling you, I ain't going to no retirement home. Oh I love it. Will you please put that cap pistol away, Mr. Cornwall? Carson! The name is Carson, Kit Carson! Hey hey, what's going on here? Old baldy here is the executor to Kit's estate. He wants to put sweet little old Kit here in one of those creepy retirement homes. That'd mean I'd never be able to walk the boulevard again, Angel. You can't force him to do that, can ya? You're damn right he can't. No, I don't think so. You better let him go, Kit. Thank you. If you can't force him, let's just leave him be. Young lady, I have been a lawyer for 25 years. Listen, schmucko. You heard what the young lady said. Now get your ass outta here, okay? Hey cheapo, I get five bucks for that. Come sit, sweetie. Well, when I get ready to be put out to pasture, I know exactly where I'm going. Arizona, well hell all of my friends are out there. I'll get to see Tom Mix again. Kit, Tom Mix is dead. Oh that's right, I plum forgot about that. Well hell, then I'll see Hoot Gibson. I think Hoot Gibson's dead too. Damn it. There ain't hardly any of us left anymore. Look, I'm really glad I found you two, because I was just on my way to the morgue. For Lana! Do you have any idea what they do to unclaimed bodies? No, I don't reckon I do. Oh, well I don't either, but whatever it is it can't be good. Well we'd better get over there, before she ends up in a tomb for the unknown hooker. You had no business being at the morgue. What the hell did you expect to accomplish? We've got a right to claim the body. We're the only family she have. I can appreciate that, Angel, but I don't make the rules. You mean to say there ain't no exceptions? Look, there's nothing I can do about it, it's the law. Then the law sucks. You people have got Lana in an icebox while you sit on your... She needs to be buried, but you don't give a damn. You've got no feelings inside! It's because you're nothing but a damn cop! Come on Mae, Kit, let's get outta here. Remind me never to get murdered. Ooh, strong aren't you? I bet you're wild in the sack, huh? Rick, I'm gonna be late for gym class. Oh come on, you don't know what you're missing, Molly. I mean why do you think they call me Razzle Dazzle? Oh, my hand! You bitch! We are gonna have so much fun you guys. We're gonna have the best game in the world. Okay, we've got the victory song, we've got the Northup rah rah rah. We'll do the fight song, and it will just be so much fun, so you guys really liven up and have a great time with it.

Get the fuck outta here! ♪ You've got something sweet ♪ You've got what I need ♪ Come to me Yes, inside, yes. Damn right I saw him. He's got a spur on his boot. He's sitting right over here. Shit, well goddamn it the sleaze bag was here not more than 10 minutes ago. There he is! - You, hold it right there. Freeze! Gentlemen, turn to your left please. Would you face front? Angel? I don't know, I'm not sure. He could be the second one from the left. Could be is not enough, Angel. I gotta have more than that. I only took one look at him, and it was dark, I'm sorry. I can't swear by it. Thanks for your help, gentlemen. You can take the men back. Lieutenant, the rookie with the coffee. His weapon's in his holster. Will the officer holding the refreshments please exit the room immediately? On the double. I repeat... - That's him, that's him! The guy at the booth! Sir, do you see anything over there? Check the alley on the other side. Get the chopper and cordon the area. Right. He went over the wall, lieutenant. We found the girl unconscious between the cars. She's alive. - Collins, we need you. - Right there. Shit! All units, shots fired. Hostile situation, officer detail. Don't worry about it, we'll get him. Come on. Shit. Really blew that. Have to pack it in. Second time I had a scene like that in 15 years. What happened the first time? Come on, I'll take you in. Thanks a lot, Lieutenant Andrews. I know, I won't leave town without notifying you. Isn't that the way it goes? Very good. I want to meet your mother. What, what no! Wait a minute, there's a law against illegal entry! Hey, this is really great! Why don't you go out and catch that killer? You're not gonna find him in here. I'm curious about something, Angel. Or is it Molly? That's your name, isn't it? Molly Stewart? Tell me something, Molly. Why does 15 year old straight A honor student who doesn't drink, doesn't take drugs, never been arrested, and lives at home with her parents work as a street prostitute, hm? You've been to my school, haven't you? Yeah, it's a good school. They think a lot of you. Yeah well I don't like people butting into my business. You work the street, you're fair game kiddo. Where's your mother? I want to speak to her. She doesn't want to speak with you! She doesn't like cops either! In there huh? Mrs. Stewart, my name is Andrews. I'm with the police. I'd like to speak with you. Mrs. Stewart? Get away from there, you son of a bitch! Haven't you ever heard of the Fourth Amendment? You mean the right of the people to be secure in their persons against unreasonable search and seizure shall not be violated? Yes, I've heard of it. Pardon me. Pretty, nice. I like the color. Your dad? How long has he been gone? Nine years. Where's your mom, Angel? Molly. Please try to forgive me. I found somebody. He's taking me to New York. Don't think I'll be back. Take care of yourself, I'm sorry, Mom. Knowing her she probably got dumped in Cleveland. It happened about three years ago. One day I came home from school, and she was gone. Just that note and a hundred dollar bill. You've been on the streets since you were 12? It was easy. I just put on some sexy clothes and high heels and went out and made a living. Jesus Christ. You still don't understand, do ya Andrews? I was alone, I'm a minor! They'd throw my ass in some court, and then it'd be foster homes from then on. I am not gonna be put in some foster home, or some institution, or somebody else's home. I am gonna stay right here until my father comes back for me. Until your father comes back? Yes damn it, until my father comes back. What makes you think he's coming back after nine years? My father will. I know he will. So what are you gonna do now, lieutenant? I know what I should do. I should turn you over to the juvenile authorities, let them take care of ya. So why don't you? I don't know. Stay home, keep the door locked. For Christ's sake, stay away from the goddamn street. I've already made up my mind, Mae. I'm against it. Dead set against it. Somebody could get hurt, honey, you. You weren't there, you didn't see the way that guy looked at me. I'm not letting that freak get to me like he did Crystal and Lana. I don't know about you, but I'm hungry. Hungry? How could you eat at a time like this? Watch. Whatever you got in that box would make me throw up. Oh. Welcome to my home, ma'am. Wow! This is really cool. It's great! This is where you live? - Yep. What's this? Best of luck, Kit. Keep them shooting irons of yourn hot, especially the one in your pants. Regards, Tom Mix. Tom Mix, you really did know him! Well you don't think I'd josh you about a thing like that, do ya? Well, I'm gonna give you a shooting iron lesson, little lady, and I want you to listen real good, 'cause there ain't nothing to it. First of all, you don't aim at all. You pretend the barrel is your finger, and you point it and you shoot it just like you did when you was a kid. Well that was the pretend part. Now this here is the real part. I thought those were toys! What in tarnation would I be doing with toys? These have got the firing pins in them, and real bullets. Now, these here are the bullets I use out on the street, and they're fake. Oh. Now, let me see that peashooter of yours. Good god almighty. Lookin' good! Woohoo, look at those legs! All aboard beaver junction! I don't fuckin' believe it. Do you know who that was? That was Molly Stewart! She's a hooker. No shit! Let's pick her up. Hey mama, I got what you're looking for. ♪ Don't you agree ♪ Sweet - Come on Molly. - Come on, hurry up! - Let's go Rick! - Come on! - Go go, go go! - Wahoo! Look Rick, you've had your fun. Now please let me go. Oh you know, you're really one hell of an actress. You had us all fooled. So sweet, so innocent. Oh come on, Molly, show us your whisker biscuit. Listen you guys, if you know what's good for you, you'll let me go right now. Oh no, no, no! We're gonna teach you a new meaning of gang bang. Please, wait, wait you don't have to force me. I'll do anything you want! Look, I just don't wanna get pregnant. Tough shit, bitch. 'Cause we don't use rubbers. Please, I've got some right here in my purse. Hey Rick, maybe we should. No telling what we might catch from this slut. Okay. I always keep them with me. Ah! Go ahead, make your move, but I'll blow his fucking brains out. Rick, don't anybody move! Rick. Okay you bastards, now get out of the car. Get out of the goddamn car! Let's get out, Rick. She's bluffing. Oh yeah? Don't shoot, don't shoot! Please please don't shoot me! - Hey! - Don't shoot, don't shoot! Hey. Look me up again, Rick. When you're toilet trained. Sarah listen, did you hear about Molly Stewart? No, what? Rick Sawyer said she made it with all three of them. Oh god, that's gross! Wait listen, that's not all. He said, and I swear to god, she's a whore! Oh no! Yeah, and she's hooking on Hollywood Boulevard. Oh shit. Oh gee, I really liked her. Yeah. Miss Allen, I'm telling you what I saw is the truth! This is ridiculous. I know this girl very, very well and what you're saying is absolutely impossible! Miss Allen, the girl is a prostitute on Hollywood Boulevard. This is ridiculous. Molly, Molly. What is it Wayne? I just wanted to ask you out. I told you, my mother won't let me out. No, no, no, look. I've been saving this, it's $23. It's all I've got. Will it be enough? Molly? I used to love going to school. You know I used to pretend that I was just like everybody else. Now they all know the truth. You know, I've had sex with hundreds of men, but I've never had anybody that loved me, or held me. I mean not anybody that I wanted to be with. I've never even had a boyfriend. You know, I wake up every morning and I think this is the last day I have to do this. Today my dad's gonna come home. You still believe that? Nah. Not anymore. You know Angel, sometimes a guy meets a woman and he sees a new life for himself, so he splits, cuts his ties with whatever he had. Time goes by and comes a point where he can't come back, no matter what. It's not 'cause he doesn't love you. Then all I've done has been a waste, hasn't it? Nothing's a waste, kid. Nothing. I feel so ashamed. Easy, kid. Easy. What have you done to your hair? Looks like an orangutan has been sitting on your face all night. Good, good, good. Whee, oh. Mhmm. Grab it. A queen, how sweet. Listen, kumquat. I don't mind the smoke, but your breath is behind it. Don't you ever inhale? God. What was that? What? This, you took this little thing and moved it from here to here. Now that's not nice. It's called cheating, okay? How fuckin' dare you? How fuckin' dare you, ya cunt? I don't have to cheat to beat the likes of you! You're not playing with blind Amy, I saw you move the goddamn peg. You're hallucinating! I'm gonna bite your goddamn falsies off, now play this game here. You're stalling! You owe me $147, see that? I owe you shit. Screw you, Lulu Bell! When I was a kid, my father warned me. He said Rachel, don't ever play cards with a Jewish dyke. They cheat! Eat my puff, will ya? Puff? Hello. One moment. Look, unless you have an instant replay and you can prove on that last move that I cheated, you will continue this goddamn game! I don't need a camera, I have eyes, you cheat, cheat! Hello? Hold onto your jack jack! Now listen, freeze everything there. I know where every peg is! I'll be right back. What do you want? You have a Margaret Stewart here? I'd like to see her, if you don't mind. Molly Stewart is her daughter. I'm her counselor at school, Patricia Allen. Yeah well now that woman's an invalid. She don't see nobody. Yes, I understand but would you ring her for me please? I'd like to find that out for myself. Ring her? What do you think this is, a Biltmore? You gotta wait 'til Molly gets home from school. I don't gotta do anything. Now I would really like to speak to Mrs. Stewart. What room is she in please? Look, Miss Hoighty toighty. The woman cannot answer the goddamn door 'cause she can't get out of her goddamn bed. Is that goddamn clear enough for ya? Well, if you give me the key then we won't have to inconvenience the woman now, will we? You don't seem to understand, lady. I can't just give someone the key to someone's apartment. Listen, fuckface. I used to work for the city health department and you got so many violations in this flea trap that one phone call downtown will put your ass in court so fast that you won't have time to wipe it, let alone pull your pants up, do you get my drift? Now you give me the goddamn key. Thank you, very much. Teh, the fuckin' mouth on that broad. Oh. Hi, honey. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you. I was looking for Mrs. Stewart. I'll just check on... Oh no, no, no, no. I am Mrs. Stewart, please come in. This is the right apartment, lovely. Now, I know what you're thinking. All this talk about me being an invalid, you know? Well, sometimes I am an invalid and sometimes I'm not. It just comes and goes, and now it's all gone so won't you join me in sitting down and a little conversation please? Thank you. Yes, the girls and I, I give a course on needlepoint and sometimes they get a little messy. I must talk to the girls. Now, what shall we talk about? Look I don't know whose mother you are, but you are definitely not Molly's. I'm not? No. You're right. But I love her. More than her mother ever did. What the hell? Shit. We gotta get her off the streets. We've gotta find her a home. And soon. Now Mae, you know how much I care for Molly and I will do anything I can to help. You keep me posted, all right? Okay. Hey, let me help you out. Oh, by the way, what's your real name? Marvin. Marvin Walker. Oh, well it has been a pleasure meeting you, Marvin. Thank you. I meant to ask you, that dress, Saks? I. Magnin's. Oh, stunning. Thank you. I got it on sale. Who dyed your hair, dickface? Hey, hey now wait a minute now. You got me all wrong. I'm not a, I'm not a girl, I'm a guy. See this? Look at all this hair like this, huh? Look, look. Phony tits. You like impressions? I do a great Eddie Cantor, how do you like this? ♪ You knew Susie like I know Susie Huh, ah before your time of course. Rock music, that's your bag isn't it? Listen to this, ah! My hair, my hair! My luck I gotta get a bald head in fighting. About your breath, ew that stinks. Fuck with me! Bitch! Please! Oh my god. Mae? Darling. Oh no. Just my luck. Last thing I'm gonna see in this world is your ugly face. Christ. Oh what are you doing? Dying, goddamnit, I'm dying. Geez. You can't die, you owe me $147 you fuckin' faggot. Solly? What darling? I don't want Angel to see me like this, okay? Promise? Yes I promise, you gorgeous broad. Thanks, baby. Oh Jesus. Mae. Darling? Mae? Sweetheart? Don't go, darling, sweetie. You gorgeous broad. You don't wanna go in there. You don't wanna go in there! In the bedroom, officer. Believe me, you don't wanna see it, honey? Just stay here. You stay right here. Answer is 257. Angel! Angel, Angel!
