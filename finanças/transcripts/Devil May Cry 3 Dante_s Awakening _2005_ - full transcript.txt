Father will yell at me again if I pass the curfew. Ouw... Are you alright? Ah, yes. Um... I think I just sprained it... Don?t move. Huh? Try stand up. It doesn?t hurt. I?m glad. Ah, I can wear my shoes myse-- Here you go. Um... what was that? A trick? Or is it magic? See you. Please wait! What is your name? Brad. Brad... Can we meet again? I?m sorry! Translated by CaT Synchronization by Method Listen, Angelina. I will NOT allow you to see that man again! Why?? Brad is a very good man! Anyway, you will not see him again! And I won?t let you out of this room until you promise me that! This is for your own good. I?m counting on you. Understood. Brad... Oooooh!! Hey, cut it out. No matter what you do no genie?s gonna help you fix it. But today?s the finale! Well too bad. I?m pissed my nap?s disturbed myself. Go buy a new one now! If I have the money. How do you lose your money so fast? Cause I have a demonic female debt collector And a bossy pigheaded agent. Who did you say was pigheaded? What? Did you bring me more moneyless jobs? That?s not true. All the jobs I bring are big on money. That is, on the condition that you do it well. Hey Morrison, can you fix the TV? TV? It?s spoilt, and today?s the finale for ?Spring Romance.? You brought your car today, Morrison? Yeah. Well then, in return for taking on that job, I?ll sleep in the car along the way. I?m having lack of sleep thanks to that broken TV. Let?s go already. I don?t care where you take me so long I don?t hear the TV shrieking. See you, miss. Eh? Won?t you fix the TV, Morrison? Have Dante buy you a new one when he gets his pay from this job. Eh? Hey wait, Morrison! In that case I won?t be in time for the finale! Hey! Oooh!! You idiot!! Miss, your meal is ready. I don?t want to eat. Please, miss. If you don?t eat I will be scolded by the master. Some luxurious house, eh? Wonder what kinda crime he does to build this. He?s the mayor of Capulet City. I?m sorry I was late. The meeting dragged on longer than I expected. Thank you for coming. -I?m Mike Hegel. -I?m Morrison. Good to see you. We can shake later. Just tell me your business before I fall asleep again. -How?s his ski-- -You have my assurance. He?s just a little difficult to talk with. I want you to kill that man. Please. Kill him. I have a single daughter by the name of Angelina. I lost my wife early and ever since I have raised her on my own. That man is trying to take my precious daughter away from this town. His name is Brad. No one even knows his origin. There?s no way I can let a stranger like him do as he pleases with Angelina! And so you want to kill him. What a touching story. Turn that into a TV drama and Patty will love it. -Um! -Miss. At least let me go to the washroom alone. Do you know there has been many cases of phantom killers in Capulet City? It?s often on TV. The TV?s busted. Oh right. Well, in any case, there has been such incidents. Here. It was so dismal there are people who suggest that the culprit isn?t human. Not human? Those incidents started happening the same time that Brad man appeared. In other words, you?re saying that Brad isn?t just a phantom killer but a demon? Ridiculous. I saw it. There is no mistake. That man is a demon. See, right up your alley no? I beg you! Please kill Brad for me! Brad! Brad! Please, let?s run away together! What?s wrong all of a sudden? Calm down and tell me. It seems like my father hired someone to kill you. Kill me? Why? Because of your mysterious power. He thinks you?re a demon. I see. Let?s run away together. Angelina, We can?t do that. I can?t get you involved in this. I-- You don?t have to worry about me, Angelina. I?ll be fine. Your father will certainly understand someday. But... Go home for today. I?m glad enough I could see you. Can I sit here? Huh? Oh please. Gimme a beer. And pizza. Oh right, I?ll take anything without olives. Don?t mind me, just continue. Well then, thank you. What?? You still can?t find her?! Don?t you dare come back until you find her! It must be that man again! I am very sorry, sir. I only left my eyes for a bit and-- Miss! Father... Understand?? From now on your food will be brought to your room And the guards will watch you twenty-four seven wherever you go! Brad... What are you reading so closely? It?s a romance novel. Hmm, is it interesting? Yes, very interesting. A person loving another. I think that is very wonderful. -True love is beautiful. -Hm! Is it weird? No. Here?s your beer. How long did you make me wait just for a beer? Now where?s my pizza? They?re making it. Cheers. Cheers. By the way, I heard you?re a stranger here. Where are you from? Well, you don?t have to answer if you don?t want to. I?m leaving now. See you around. -Here?s your pizza. Thanks for waiting. -Hey, there?re olives. Of course. Tch.... I heard the gate?s opening tonight. I see. But it?s quite a shame we?ll have to leave this world. So you were the phantom killer after all. Human blood?s my favorite food you see. Who?s there?! You followed me? Eating an L size in five minutes is a new personal record. Don?t fuck with me!! That?s quite the warm handshake. You?re strong as I expected. Sounds like you know about me. It?s been a month since I came to the human world. I?ve heard of your rumors. Devil hunter, Dante. I suppose I can take it that you?re admitting you?re not human. Yes. No complaints then? No. I don?t feel like I can run away from you. But there is just one thing I?d like to ask you. What? I heard you?re born of a human and a demon. If that?s the case, did you parents truly love each other? Both demon and human. Who knows? I often hear married couples are loving on the outside but cold on the inside. That?s-- But, the way I saw it they both loved each other from the bottom of their hearts. I see. Is that all you want to say? Yes. I thought you were gonna sneak an attack on me. I can?t defeat you anyway. You sound pretty discouraging for a demon. I may be a demon but I?m not one capable of fighting you. Besides, my duty?s over. Duty? My master will appear here from the demon world tonight. I was summoned by a certain someone to make those preparations. Why are you telling me this? Maybe I wanted you to stop it. My master is greed. He will surely devour everything in this town. The delicious coffeehouse. The beautiful sunset, Everything. Angelina too? What should I do? I don?t want to lose Angelina. She was so kind. I was treated pathetically in the demon world but Angelina would smile at me. I don't want to think that she'd die. But I?m a demon. I don?t even have the strength to go against my master. It?s true you may be good-for-nothing, as a demon that is. But if you really love Angelina that much, you can live your life as a human. A human? Me? Take me there. The place that links to the demon world. Father? Father! What happened? Father! Father! Father! Father! Father! Hang in there, father! Don?t move. You could have died without tasting this fear if you?ve obediently stayed in your room. You... Why did you... Soon enough a mighty demon will be summoned to this world, thanks to the ritual I performed. Together, we shall DESTROY the world! Dante! Oops. Guess I knocked too hard. I had a bad feeling when the mayor got you involved, but it?s too late now! Angelina! Brad! Mr. Mike, pull yourself together! Brad! Are you planning to betray Belveul!? You?re too late! Belveul will be appearing anytime now! Good work coming all this way! Too bad here on entry?s forbidden! Sorry but I?m gonna have to ask you to leave! Angelina. Father. What is this... Father, don?t speak anymore. Brad, please. This is my first time with such a big wound, but I?ll try my best. Wh-what are you doing, you demon... Did you think I?d agree to your relationship with Angelina by doing this? Father! Please don?t worry. I am not thinking of that at all. I just don?t want to see Angelina?s sad face. Mr. Mayor, sorry but I don?t think I can accept your request. Brad knows of love. He is well capable of living as a human. And all I can exterminate is demons. Hey Morrison, are you done yet? Yes, yes, yes. Ooooh! Till when are you going to make me wait? Please just wait a little more, miss. By the way, Dante. I heard those two are finally accepted and that?s wonderful news, but thanks to you missing out on the money I?m stuck on fixing this TV, and I just can?t agree on that. Stop talking and hurry up! The show?s going to start! And it?s done. Ah, it?s on! I?ll be taking my repair fee from your next pay, Dante. Hmph! Whatever. Really, at this rate no matter how good a job I bring you you?ll never gonna clear your debt. But you seem to look happy, Dante. Even though you were always complaining about how you?re not getting your money. There?re days like this once in a while. I hope the two of them are happy. I?ve had rotten luck with women since forever. It?s still okay when I get beat up. But then they?d stab me and shoot me in the head. If I weren?t me I?d have died, geez. And yet my inseparable relationship with such women continues. When will this rotten luck ever improve?
