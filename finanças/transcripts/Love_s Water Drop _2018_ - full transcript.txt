Welcome, we've been waiting for you. Mr. Asahina, your friend has arrived. Miss Tachibana. You possess such a remarkable knowledge of wine at such a young age, and your keen sense of taste is truly astonishing. Oh no, I just happened to be familiar with this type of wine. With its rich and smooth fruit aroma, and abundant acidity, this is the semi-sweet white wine from Domaine des Ormes in Burgundy, France. This is the Chardonnay white wine from France, but not from Côte de Beaune; it's from Chablis, from the Verget Winery. A naturally produced red Burgundy wine, with a balanced body and tannins. This is the Gevrey-Chambertin from Philippe Pacalet. Wow, this is truly impressive. Amazing! I've been searching for talent like you. I can recommend you to study at a French winery. If you wish to study in the sacred land of winemaking, I can assist you. Studying in France has always been my dream. Sorry, I need to take a call. Shiori, don't you understand? He's trying to woo you. Huh? I don't feel that way at all... Then just agree! But remember, he's known for "YSP." "YSP"？ "Yatte Sappari" – "Chase, Sleep, then Leave." Mariko, what should I do? If you're scared, just run away. But there are so many wines I haven't tried... That's just how you are... Then use that one. Highly active ALDH2! You really hold your liquor well. Because I have a highly active ALDH2 enzyme. Where can you get that stuff? No, sorry, I mean I have a strong alcohol metabolism. Ah, I see... Well, I should be going. I'll leave the aftermath to you. Huh? Really? The reagent formula is sodium hydroxide plus a surfactant. Because this alkaline reagent can effectively separate DNA, with this method, even delicious sake like this... Can be analyzed at the genetic level. Professor Takanohashi! What's up? Oh, I'm not drinking. Professor, could you explain? Who else could it be? So it's you, Tachibana. I'm in the middle of teaching a sophomore class. I clearly applied for an internship at a winery. Why did they assign me to a sake brewery? Oh, winery positions are highly competitive, so we had to draw lots. Sake It was decided by lottery. Yes, to ensure fairness. But I didn't draw it myself! That's true, but it's a matter of probability. It would have been the same no matter who drew it. I really want to study wine no matter what. Hmm... Sake is also worth studying. But...Japanese sake doesn't suit my body. Huh? You can drink wine but not sake? Do you have any allergies? Huh? Is there? - I don't know. - Can't believe you're saying you don't know. But seriously, I can't drink sake. Please switch me to the winery. I told you... Otherwise... I'll boycott the internship! boycott…? Up to you... But if you don't do the internship, you won't get credits. Without credits, you'll have to repeat the year. And that means your dream of going abroad to study... Might not come true. I won't oppose if you're okay with it. No… Going abroad to study? I want to go. Right? Wine and sake are both fermented drinks, not much difference. I don't like simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. Converting starch to sugar before fermentation, it's so inefficient. Here she goes again, Shiori always belittle sake. Can't help it... Whenever I think of that incident... Don't get me wrong. I'm just... Is everything okay, Shiori? Stirring up trouble and getting on the blacklist left a shadow, huh? Being afraid of sake but willing to work at a sake brewery is quite a situation. Which sake brewery are you going to? In Hiroshima... a place called Saijo. That's one of Japan's top three brewing regions, you know. Nada in Hyogo, Fushimi in Kyoto, Saijo in Hiroshima. Hmm, great places. Then change with me! No, I've been assigned to the Hakodate Brewery, the one I applied for. Look, Shiori. The brewery's overseas study program still has openings. I'm going! I'm signing up right away! But you can't study abroad without doing the internship, right? Right... 【For Love's Sake】 Is anyone here? Is anyone here? What's up? I'm Shiori Tachibana, here for an internship from Nihon Agricultural University. Internship? We're not hosting any this year. Alright, I understand. Goodbye. I checked with my school, they said this is the right place. But...the boss didn't tell me... And I didn't receive any notification... Miss. Tamori, the warehouse is ready for rice storage... Misaki, she said she's a college student interning from Tokyo. Huh? Didn't we decide not to do internships this year? Ah, yeah... If you want to know, you should ask Mr. Nogami. Oh dear... The author is a young ceramic artist who doesn't emphasize individuality, but rather aims to create vessels that harmonize with food. - Do we have any plates? - Ah, yes, we do. These vessels can multiply the effects of dishes and wine. I don't understand multiplying or adding, though... But it doesn't match the color scheme of our restaurant. Ah... I see. By the way, you're the owner of "Nogami Sake Brewery," right? Uh... sort of... What do you mean, "sort of"? Didn't you inherit the family business? I already have this job. Where do you live in Tokyo? Setagaya, near the university. I see. I used to live in Yoyogi Uehara. Because I went to university and became a salaryman in Tokyo. But that was ten years ago. I understand. Now I'm farming in my hometown. That area over there is our field. It's all sake rice, and once it's harvested, we sell it to Nogami Sake Brewery. Quite a remote and impoverished place, huh? That's a big house you've got. Every household here is this big. Come this way. You can use this bicycle to get around; the convenience store is quite far. Alright. I'm back. It's not like I wanted to come here. Got rejected, it's so frustrating. Our place is really great. We have a French instructor who's incredibly handsome. If he pursued me, I'd go with him immediately. Hey, are you even listening to me? Yes, I'm definitely listening. It's okay. I'm going to sleep now. Goodbye. Huh? Hey, wait a moment, Shiori... For the sake of studying abroad, I have to endure for now... - Good morning. - Morning. Park your bicycle over here. Ah, sure. Hey, that's really dangerous! Take your bike to the side over there. Who's she? You're the intern from Tokyo, right? Um, so... What do I do now? An internship, huh... Alright, you can be an intern. Huh? Can I? What else can you do? You're already here; we can't just send you back, right? Right? Thanks! Is this okay? Just consider her internship done when she finishes it. I'll tell your university you've done well. You can't just brush it off like this. I still have to submit a report. No, absolutely not! So straightforward! Once you've got the internship certificate, take a break! Talking to you is pointless. Have the boss come talk to us. Can't do that. "Can't do that" is not something you should say casually. The boss is bedridden, so he can't talk to you. boss! Kanji, why are you here? Oh no, I should go. The rest is up to you guys now. Ouch! Who's that? Miss Misaki! Ouch, it hurts... What are you doing? Stop it! We were rejecting internships this year. But it seems there was a mistake. Sorry about that. Is there really no way for me to intern? If i can't get internship credits, I can't study abroad. Then I won't be able to continue my education. Miss Tachibana Shiori? Why did you apply to intern here with us? Well... I wanted to study wine. So I applied to wineries. But... the lottery didn't work out... I see. That's a shame. I'm sorry. Have you ever tried our sake? No, I haven't. Is she living at your place now? Otherwise, that's just pitiful, being rejected after coming to intern. And that's all thanks to some idiot. What's wrong? You've been heartbroken, haven't you? Miss Misaki only treats others well when she's feeling down herself. Oh, stop it. You've never had a girlfriend and yet you dare say that? I intentionally don't date. This is "Koi Nobori," our junmai sake. Alright, cheers. Thank you. boss! What are you doing? You should take your medicine. The water is here. - Miss Tachibana, please drink. - Okay. I'm really sorry. It's my fault for being unwell. Do you not like Japanese sake, Miss Tachibana? When you smelled the sake, it seemed like you turned away. Perhaps this also signifies fate isn't on your side. After all, it's our mistake. I'll contact the school. Now, pour the rest of this in. Huh? More sake? Because alcohol keeps evaporating. This is Sado's specialty, "Bijon Nabe." It's a feast dish that was eaten by brewery workers in the past. The term for being drenched in sweat after brewing, "Bijon," sounds like "bijo," meaning "beautiful woman." With beautiful women and good sake, it became Bijon Nabe. Thank you. I'm starting. Um! Delicious! If you can drink, why can't you handle just Japanese sake? It's not that I can't handle it. My body reacts negatively. Maybe it's because of my aldehyde dehydrogenase. It's a slow-acting variant that's less efficient with Japanese sake. I don't quite understand... Anyway, you can't drink, that's the point. I used to drink it before, but I ended up getting really drunk. Now even the smell of alcohol makes me uncomfortable. In that case, you should just go back. How can you intern like this? This is a brewing town. My family also cultivates sake rice. Nogami's boss already said it, it's just not meant to be. Miss Misaki, what should I do? I don't know either. Oh, how about coming to our place to help tomorrow? I didn't expect it to be quite fitting. Girls from Tokyo look cute in anything they wear. That's true. Here, these shoes are for you. Good luck! Thank you. Good morning everyone! Ah, Big Brother, please take care of me this year as well. Likewise. The weather is a bit worrying, isn't it? Yeah, I hope it clears up soon. - Good morning, Big Brother. - Oh. Shiori, this is Mr. Hiramashita, the brewmaster at Nogami. Big Brother, this is the intern who came from Tokyo to Nogami... I'm Tachibana Shiori. Nice to meet you. An intern? I didn't hear that we were taking interns this year. I heard there was a mistake. It would be great if you could ask Big Brother and the boss for a favor. Telling me won't do any good... Spread your legs a bit, or you might get cut by the sickle. Don't squat; stand and bend over. Look here. Grip the outer side, pull it once, and cut the whole bundle. Don't let go until you've cut two or three bundles. Alright. Miss Misaki! Long time no see! he's still the same. He insists on cutting the rice by hand in that field alone. That's just how Big Brother is. The girl on the left side... .who is she? Oh, she's Nogami's intern. From Tokyo? Could it be... you're into that type? Let me introduce you. …Really? Kanji. Do you realize you've ruined a student's future? Initially, you said you wanted to teach young people the art of brewing sake and pass down the tradition. That's why you agreed to take interns, right? I told you I didn't want to, and yet you can't even handle it properly when you agree. One moment you agree, the next you reject. If you're so casual about it, I'll be casual too. All you know is how to talk! If you're not inheriting the family business, then stop having so many opinions! Be at the brewery tomorrow morning at 8. Even the boss agreed to it. Alright! Thank you! What are you wearing? This isn't a laboratory, you know. Never mind. Listen up. Today is "Aki-arai," the pre-brew cleaning. First, clean up, then wash. Both have to be done thoroughly. Every corner needs to be spotless to please the sake god. - Yes! - Yes! My feet... my feet are exhausted... What happened? You're all disheveled from cutting some rice? Darn it! Darn it! It hurts so much... Don't forget to wash the tub. Okay. Um, what's a "tub"? -That one! - That one! - Quick, pull it over. pull again Hey, the young lady over there. Have you washed all these? Yes, I have. What about this one? washed. I'll wash it again. I don't have confidence in the others either. I'll wash them all again. All of them? What's the matter? Any objections? It's not that I have objections; I just feel it's not worth it. Huh? What did you say? Washing them all again would be a waste of time. I'll redo this one, and the rest can just be checked. The point of Aki-arai is to pray to the sake god. It's a sincere act, hoping to brew good sake this year. I heard you hate Japanese sake. Perhaps you should start by learning to like it? Your attitude is crucial, no matter what you do. Today's fine, let's hit the road. "Hit the road"? I'm telling you to go back, you dummy. Dummy...!? Why are you speaking so harshly... Oh no! Are you serious... Look at what you've done... Aren't you the one who doesn't watch where you're walking? And you're the one who's lost in thought while walking, you idiot! Both of you, calling each other idiots and dummies, what's with the hostility? Who cares about you, idiot! In the end, it's all your fault, isn't it? It's because you messed up everything. You... egghead! You broke something; you better reimburse me. Sure, I'll pay. Thirty thousand yen for everything! Thirty thousand! Three thousand would be about right. Don't you dare set the price, idiot! After all, it was junk to begin with, right? Extortionists! Scammers! Charlatans! You agreed to it; you must compensate me, no doubt about it! The scenery is great, isn't it? Every time I'm upset, I come here. How did it end up like this? Because I, who clearly don't like Japanese sake, came here. So did the sake god get angry? A science major like you saying such unscientific things. You see, I wanted to study wine, but I didn't get picked. Still, I came here with enthusiasm, only to be rejected. And now I have to pay thirty thousand for a broken item. Well, the way you put it... It's not really your fault, is it? Why is it my fault if you have questions? Well, shall we go have a drink then? Let's go! Did it break? Sorry, it fell on the ground. This color is really beautiful... This kind of color is hard to achieve in fire. It's possible to get a similar color in fire. When's the next kiln fire? Next month. If you're free, come and help. Okay, I'm really sorry. Don't worry about it. Shiori, do you have a boyfriend? No. You say that so confidently. Well, it's the truth. That's perfect. What do you mean? stay tuned. He is Yushige Ichiki of Yushige Winery. The rising star in the sake world. Thank you. You must be Miss Shiori, who dislikes Japanese sake. Oh, you... Let's not talk too much. Try this first. Please. Are you making me drink sake already? Don't worry. You'll change your view on sake today. Don't worry. You'll change your view on sake today. Then try this cup. Drink it like you would with wine. It smells so nice. There are many types of sake in Japan. Some are rich, some are light; some have strong aroma, some are subtle. Some are sour, some aren't; some are fresh, some are mature. These can be further divided into sweet and unsweet categories. The acidity is just right, and the taste is very distinctive! The previous cup was an immature sake with a strong alcohol taste. This cup, on the other hand, is a junmai ginjo sake brewed by Hiroshima's renowned sake maker... I should be able to drink this. Well, try another kind now. please. Is this the same type of sake? This is a sake with a solid texture that can be enjoyed at various temperatures. This sake probably comes from... I knew it Mr. Negami's brewery. The fermentation is just right, resulting in a solid sake. When the owner asked me to drink it before, I couldn't handle it. That's because... you had "prejudice," right? Miss Shiori doesn't actually dislike Japanese sake. She just doesn't understand it. I've never really taken the time to get to know Japanese sake. Why not start getting to know it now? Miss Misaki, I have to return to the brewery. Good morning. I was wrong yesterday, I'm sorry. Please teach me how to brew Japanese sake from scratch. I'm counting on you! Oh, I didn't expect you to be interested in flowers too. These are my mother's favorite flowers. Today is the anniversary of her passing. I see. Can I borrow it for a moment? My family owns a flower shop. Your mother looks really young. She passed away when I was 15. Thank you. Your brewery is doing so well. Why not take over? Doing well... Perhaps that's how it appears to outsiders. Mind your own business and go bankrupt sooner. Miss Tachibana. Oh, thank you. - Please have a seat. - Thank you. "Life is short, parting is inevitable. There's nothing more sorrowful. If I can have my wish, I only ask for life." This is a waka poem my wife loved during her lifetime. Now I truly understand its meaning. What does this song mean? I should apologize properly to you. We made mistakes and it affected you. I'm truly sorry. I sincerely apologize to you. should apologize. My behavior earlier was rude. I'm sorry. So... shall we consider this a reconciliation? Sure. Miss Tachibana. You... have a somewhat similar demeanor... No worries. This year's wine should turn out to be quite delicious. - Come on. - Thank you. Originally, Hiroshima's soft water wasn't suitable for sake brewing. Later, Senzaburo Miura invented the soft water brewing method, turning weaknesses into strengths. Impressive, right? Huh? Oh... oh... You're really diligent in your studies, Shiori. Are there no good men there? What do you mean, good men... Seize the opportunity, get a boyfriend. Miss. Mariko the meeting is about to start. Alright, alright, OK. Sorry, I have to go now. Life is short, parting is inevitable..." "The Tale of Genji" - "I'll put the medicine here." - "Oh." Tomori. I really hope I can last until this year's sake is brewed. What are you saying? It's nothing, really. Alright, everyone. We have one goal: to brew great sake. The first step is to extinguish our egos. -Yes. - Yes. No, no, it should be thoroughly stirred from the bottom. - Exactly, exactly. - That's right. Okay, it should be ready. Lift it up! Got it. Alright, now soak it in. Okay. Good. It absorbs water really well. This rice is great. - So beautiful... - Mm. Can I? Um, yes! Okay. Miss Misaki? Are you okay? Mm, yesterday... I had a bit too much to drink. Be more gentle. You need to be careful. Go over there. Flip it over. This way, we'll know how the steaming is going. brother? To succeed, you have to be as gentle as she is. Unlike you, who would fail. - I'll punch you! - Hahaha... Come on. Come Ah, very smooth. - Isn't it? - So great... Shiori? - It's really hot. - Oh. - Come on. - Thank you. Start with the hottest ones when you're drinking these. Alright. It's really hot. Hmm? How is it? Right, the taste has changed. Hot sake has a strong taste, and t he cooler it gets, the more mellow it becomes. Oh! This kid has a sensitive palate! We should thank the Arishige for that. Huh? Shiori, are you and Arishige having a "fiery" romance? When did that start? No way! That's good. A relationship between a man and a woman is only natural. Brewing sake and love are connected. Making sake is like giving birth. You used to use these lines to flirt, didn't you? Big brother used to be quite the ladies' man. Unfortunately, those days are over. shut up! Listen well. You must remember this. Brewing sake is the work of nurturing life. Saijo Sake Festival Cheers! It's not even noon yet. It's quite chaotic. The real show is just beginning. This festival is irresistible to those who love sake. - Want a drink? - Ah, thank you! Dreams always seem out of reach, making us want to give up. But we only have one life. We should give it our all. Congratulations! thank you all! Congratulations on winning the gold award for three consecutive years. Thank you. First, please share your most sincere thoughts. This is the result of the unity between the brewmaster and the brewing staff. This sake is truly delicious. Kazuaki's masterpiece. It's wonderful this year as well. Miss Misaki, Miss Shiori, congratulations on winning the gold award. Three years in a row is amazing! Thank you. Please drink. Thanks. Miss Misaki, where's your wine glass? I don't drink. I'm a committee member. Can't get drunk. Such a shame. Well then, let's raise a glass with Shiori, who loves Japanese sake! cheers! Miss Tangerine? Mr. Asahina? Didn't expect to run into you in a place like this. Why are you here? I'm here for a university internship. Oh? Wait, do you two know each other? Could you be interning under Mr. Nogami? Yes, I'm interning at Nogami Winery. Oh, what a coincidence! Who's that? The wine merchant who hosts "King of Wines" on TV. But isn't Ms. Tachibana into studying grape wine? Why would Mr. Asahina be here? I'm planning to brew Japanese sake with Nogami Winery. It's a business collaboration, and I want to invite him to join the venture. Business Cooperation? Go call the boss. - Come over here. - What's up? I said to grin. What are you up to, anyway? What do you mean? Do the boss and big brother know about this? No, they still don't know. Is this really okay? Can you make decisions without consulting? Hey, what kind of business collaboration? I haven't heard of it. Everything should be discussed first. How could we manage otherwise? You guys are so old-fashioned... What did you say? - Say that again! - Big brother! Is everything okay? Yeah. Sorry. We won't do the business collaboration! I always thought he was foolish, but I didn't expect him to be this foolish. You're so stubborn, that's why we're in the red every year! If you don't understand, don't butt into business matters! I've told you, but you never listen! This is Nogami's Winery, protected for 180 years! What's the point of guarding the old name's pride? Do you want to ruin this winery in your generation? no! I want to protect this winery! How can you just bring in outsiders like this? I won't allow... dad? dad! Miss Tomoya... dad! dad! - What's wrong? - Dad... Should we take him to the hospital? I'm fine. I'll just rest for a bit... He's okay. Sake consumption is declining every year, and revenue isn't improving. The debt from equipment investments keeps piling up. Well, which winery hasn't faced this problem? This small winery produces only 200 "koku," it can't hold up. Even so, decisions shouldn't be made without asking the owner. My dad has been avoiding reality and not doing anything. If things continue like this, we'll just watch the winery close down. ...Is it that serious? If Asuhina joins in the management, there should be a breakthrough. At this point, if we don't make significant changes, there won't be a future. He promised me that he would preserve the winery's name no matter what. And besides... Elder brother and the sake brewer can continue brewing sake here. After all, if the brewery goes under, we won't be able to make sake anymore. So, he was also considering the well-being of the brewery... I've changed my opinion of him a bit. The weather is getting colder. Yeah, the temperature difference here is quite significant. Ordinary pottery is fired at 1200 degrees. As for us... Hey, Mr. Fujita Oh, Kanji. I dodged yesterday to save you from getting hit. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it, don't worry! Ah, Shiori. I thought she was dating some wealthy guy. I never expected you'd be researching Japanese sake. I plan to study wine abroad after finishing my internship. I want to use your exceptional taste buds to create a new business. No, you're exaggerating. Japanese sake is gaining international popularity under the name "SAKE" now. It's a good time to promote it worldwide. Is that why you're collaborating with Negami Sake Brewery? But I don't intend to export their sake as is. What do you mean? I want to create a completely new type of Japanese sake that rivals wine. To achieve that, we must use data and implement thorough quality control, rather than relying on experience and intuition. And what about the brewers? We won't need brewers after that. In fact, obtaining the brewery license and basic brewing techniques were the main goals of this collaboration. Mr. Kanji. Mr. Negami... So, this is your true intention. Which part are you referring to? Mr. Asahina. You said you wanted to save our brewery, but it was all a lie. MrMr. Negami, you mentioned it yourself. As long as we can retain the brand name and produce bestselling sake. This is equivalent to rejecting the traditional brewer system. I can't accept terms that won't protect the brewers. This contradicts the agreement we reached earlier. Many breweries don't have brewers, yet they still produce high-quality sake. That's none of our business! If things continue this way, Negami Brewery will go bankrupt. - Stop with the nonsense. - Those are the words I wanted to say. Stop it, Mr. Kanji! Don't resort to violence! Let go of me! - Are you okay? - Don't touch me. Mr. Asahina? Let's consider the collaboration never happened. The one who approached me about collaboration was you. Miss Tachibana, let's meet again in Tokyo. Sorry to borrow this. Ouch! What are you doing? Disinfect it! Don't move! Mr. Tsuboshima... I'm considering giving Kanji the freedom to do as he wishes I understand his perspective now. I'll leave the future in your hands. Alright. Five years ago, a powerful typhoon hit us hard. make us miserable However, Mr. Negami still bought all the rice at market price. I'll never forget that moment for the rest of my life. He said, "Rice and sake are gifts from the heavens." It's inevitable to have good and bad times; it's a way of helping each other." We truly received a lot of care from him. Honey, not like this. Stop it! Don't give me your nonsense. Kanji If you don't inherit it, what will happen to the brewery? That winery has a history of hundreds of years. Honey, not here... Shut up!Stop with your nonsense. If you don't inherit it, what will happen to the brewery? You need to think about it! Relatives, say something, don't stay silent! If things continue this way, it's hopeless! Seriously, you're all so useless. Kanji Kanji! Show some spirit! I'm begging you, please! I'm sorry. My father and I are always fighting. He was drunk when my mother passed away, so I resented him. I resented both him and alcohol. I was determined not to inherit the brewery. But now I'm lost and regretful. I wish I had talked to him more. I wish I had talked to him more. Shared a drink together. The wine bottle... was it meant for sharing with him? Such an important thing... and I... I… I blamed my weakness... all… All on my father. What should I do about the brewery... I'm completely clueless now. It's surprising that you attended. You don't usually show up. You came to my father's funeral, so I'm returning the favor. At this gathering, if you're a first-timer, you have to drink three cups in a row. I've never heard of that rule... but i'll drink Would you like to join us, Reiga-senpai? I'll let you off the hook. When you don't even have the resolve to inherit the brewery? How could I lose to you in drinking. Shouldn't we stop them, Miss Misaki? I don't care. They won't stop until they're completely drunk. Is he okay? Be careful, be careful. I can still drink! Alright, alright. You've had too much to drink. Got you. Shiori, why are you over there? Are you alright? Don't sway too much. Elder brother... What's the matter? I… Definitely won't inherit the brewery! No need to say anything now. I already know. Hey, wait! Hold on! Fine, take a moment to collect yourself. What a humiliation... Miss Shiori... I can't catch up. Don't talk like that. Don't give up, keep trying! It's really not working! Because... the one I really like... It's you, Miss Misaki. I agreed to meet Shiori only to see you. I've liked you, Miss Misaki, for a long time. I'm serious. Alright, alright, thanks. Mozzarella pizza and fruit salad... Paired with... Junmai Daiginjo to go along... Enjoy, Miss. Takamiya. Thank you, Kurata. Sister, won't you drink today? No, I'm driving. Great match! Especially the acidity. The wine's acidity, plus lactic acid and... Succinic acid, malic acid. Right! Matching the wine's acidity with the dish makes both better. Different ways of eating have their own charm. Next, aged sake served warm. With pork cutlet. Sorry, what? Huh? Pork cutlet with warm sake? Give it a taste. I thought pork cutlet should be paired with beer, but hot sake is a great match. It feels like the hot sake removes the oiliness of the pork cutlet. The rich and complex flavor of Japanese sake... With its abundant aromatic components, it's not limited to Japanese cuisine; it can be paired with various dishes. You still tend to act recklessly after drinking. Take care of yourself. Oh no, I don't remember anything. I'm really sorry. So... what about the winery? I don't know. I don't have the confidence to inherit it. If you keep talking like that, you'll never achieve anything in your life. so… I want to take a trip. A tour of the bridge, perhaps? The pork cutlet is already delicious, and I didn't expect the hot sake to pair so well. I've been wanting to introduce you to that restaurant for a while now. - Miss Misaki - Huh? Thank you for taking care of me. Why so serious? You've made my holiday wonderful. That's good to hear. Huh? Is that a smile? Mr. Kanji! Did you mistake someone? No, that's definitely Kanji. Hey, wait! Why run away? ah wait... why are he ignoring us? Misaki sis, I've decided. ah? I've decided. - Big brother - Huh? Big brother, I brought the beans to be ground... Ah... Is there a guest? Perfect timing. Help us make some coffee. Alright. Huh? Mr. Kanji? You want to ask me about this...? This seems to be something my mother treasured. Did you know? This was handwritten by the landlady herself. My mom wrote this? She said if they produced new sake, they would name it "Seeking Life." What happened to the drink? The landlady passed away, so the plan was interrupted. What kind of sake is it? A traditional-style, pure rice Junmai Daiginjo sake brewed with traditional yeast. Traditional yeast? When I heard "Seeking Life," this came to mind. Understand the nature of microorganisms, follow the laws of nature in brewing... What's brewed is life itself. But I've never used this method before, so I've been studying hard. Learning with the head of the estate. My dad? We drink sake brewed with traditional yeast every day for research. Even after the landlady fell ill, he didn't give up... He said that because making new sake was her wish. On the day my mom passed away, he got drunk... - She said... "I'll fight against the illness, you must work hard to brew." Big brother... This "Seeking Life"... Can you brew it, please? Why should I obey your command? I, as the head of the Nogami Sake Brewery, implore you! Is this suit a symbol of determination? Yes. This is my resolution... And my respect for my big brother and all the brewers! I will oversee the brewing, but the brewery still belongs to the head. If you become the head, I'll listen to you completely. Thank you brother! Kanji as the head? Really? "Is this suit a symbol of determination?" "It's respect for my big brother and all the brewers!" You're picking up on this like it's a gangster movie. Mr. Kanji looks quite the part in a suit. So that's how it is... Huh? What do you mean? Listening to you and Kanji, you sound so cheerful. Brewing up a romance? Brewing... romance...? Ah, no, wait, don't misunderstand! Oh... I see, that's how it is... No, No, it's not that way, okay? - Clearly not that kind of feeling... - Alright, alright. I just want to cheer for him... Alright, alright, get in the car. Miss Misaki please... Ladies, stop gawking and hurry up, take off your clothes. I'm not taking mine off. Believe me, I'll knock some sense into your head. let's go. come on. Do you want to try? Sure, I want to try! Hey, start from the bottom, Put some effort into it. Yes, yes, yes, that's it. A few days ago, I was out of line, I'm truly sorry. Did you really invite me out just to discuss this? No, it's just... At that time, what I said to you... Even though it slipped out while I was drunk... I'm sorry. But it was the truth! Age difference, how old are you this year? 29 years old This kind of psychology is common. Is there an fascination for older girls? Enjoying their gentle and generous treatment... Sometimes she'll stand up for you, occasionally scold you... And she's a sexy beauty, no wonder you're captivated. No, it's not like that... So, I also understand your feelings. But you were just momentarily confused, you misunderstood. No, it's not wrong. It's not wrong! I've liked you for a long time. My first love, it's you, Miss Misaki. Miss Misaki Am I really not good enough? I'm pregnant. You'll surely find someone who matches you better. Big brother... Can I do this together? Oh, you've got some determination too. Alright. Who's better, Kikui or Koyoru? Of course, Koyoru. What are you doing? I'm observing what's inside this barrel. It's like a small universe. Rice being broken down and fermenting by koji. Then yeast enters the scene, transforming into alcohol. It's quite magical. To think they invented brewing in a time without the concept of microorganisms. Big brother also said... As long as we follow the methods passed down by our predecessors. "The first step is to destroy the self." Now I seem to understand what he meant when he said that during the brewing process. I'm not living alone. After all, brewing is teamwork. You're exuding the aura of a brewer now. You're the same, aren't you? You're making wine, aren't you? actually… What's the matter? I got accepted for the French study abroad program I applied for earlier. Oh! That's wonderful! but i don't know what to do. It's possible that I'll have to return to Tokyo before "Seeking Life" is complete. Do I really want to go to France? If that's the case... Maybe you should cover the cost of the broken wine bottles first. Just kidding! I don't want to hear a joke right now! I'm genuinely troubled, I don't know what to do. I have no idea about that. True, you're right. It's your own matter, only you can decide. After all, this matter... doesn't concern Mr. Kanii. Miss Misaki, are you okay? Do you want to rest indoors? Have a fever? You should see a doctor. You're so nosy. Shiori, stop bothering me. Miss Misaki, Your health has been poor lately, and you haven't been drinking any alcohol either. I'm really worried about you. Afraid that you might fall ill. Shiori, did you misunderstand something? I, um, I'm pregnant. -Pregnant? -Pregnant? Ah, um, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! But how could this happen... It's useless to ask me. I only realized it after we broke up. Does the guy you broke up with know about this? How could I possibly tell him? I don't want to see him at all. What! If you don't tell him, how will he know what's happening! That's right! Oh, stop talking about it! I don't even know what to do myself! Miss Misaki! Why are you suddenly so serious? What are you trying to say? This box contains things I found when I was organizing my father's belongings. There are also things from my mother inside. Can you understand Yukio Mishima's books? that's not the point. look here. "May heaven bless us with offspring." "Nogami Kinuyo" Is this a prayer? I asked Uncle about what happened back then... Kinuyo couldn't have children all along, she tried her best. She said she couldn't let the old family brewery die out, so she endured various hardships mentally as well. And I couldn't help her. I could only give her that book to help pass the time. "cross the bridge" A story of four women crossing seven bridges in prayer. Did my mother try the same ritual? There were originally seven rivers in Hiroshima City. Now there are six, but it's similar to the stage of "Crossing the Bridge." The details of the prayer cannot be shared with anyone. You also can't talk to anyone on the way. And you can't turn back. By crossing all the rivers within Hiroshima City this way... After crossing all seven bridges, your wish will come true. Is that a Kanji? Mr. Kanji! So you were doing this back then. I get it. Going for a walk when troubled, right? Walking helps sort out your thoughts. But setting tasks and achieving wishes... This way of thinking is as simple as using oneself as filter paper for thin-layer chromatography. Sorry, I'm just thinking naively! I want to try. I want to cross the bridge too! Considering your condition, it might be better if you don't... Understand that I'm not sick. I'm just pregnant. But if something were to happen... I know my body the best. You don't need to worry. One's own matter... Still, only oneself can decide, huh? I want to try too. I want to go! Shiori, you don't need to worry about me... It's not that. Crossing the bridge in prayer... I want to do it too. Before crossing all seven bridges, you can't talk to anyone. You can't send letters or use LINE. And you can't turn back, okay? Alright. Miss Misaki, let's meet here once you've crossed the bridge successfully. Boss, there's a customer. Miss Misaki, I want to talk to you about something! I know what you're doing. Kanji told me. I only came after finding out. Since that day, I've been thinking... In the traditional brewing process... Nitrate-reducing bacteria, wild yeast, lactic acid bacteria, yeast... Countless bacteria are born and then die along with it. Among them, only yeast can give birth to alcohol in the wine. This thing called wine... The act of brewing, it's like biological evolution. Wine isn't manufactured. But born! It's life itself, a gift from heaven. so… So, Miss Misaki... Please give birth to the child in your belly! And then... let me become a part of the family too. Please marry me! The three of us... let's live together fool. I'm just a fool. I'm praying... Don't disturb me... This is… Fate's arrangement. Keep walking! Once you complete all of them, things should change. Congratulations. Thank you. You knew about Miss Misaki's wish from the start? Well, I'm good at guessing with Miss Misaki. It's better that it failed in the end. Ah, what did you write on the votive tablet? I won't tell you. Did you peek? I didn't peek. I'm a very greedy person. What greed, probably a very boring wish, right? I won't tell you. Something like "I hope I'll grow taller"? no. Brother, please! No, how could I drink before my big brother? It's fine. This is the sake brewed to carry on the will of the previous generation. Stop fussing, just drink. This is... "Seeking Life"... No... why would it be me... Then I won't be shy. This sake carries life within it. It's the sake that conveys the intentions of the brewer! The traditional yeast has been very successful... Boss, congratulations. Congratulations. Thank you. You're welcome. It's truly a great sake, with a robust flavor. Next, Shiori. How is it? It's a taste that I'll never forget in my lifetime. "Life is limited, the path ahead will part, nothing is sadder." "If I can fulfill my wishes, I seek only to have life." These are waka poems from The Tale of Genji. Kanji's mother must have chosen the sake name based on this. Why? This waka poem was composed by Kiritsubo before her death for her beloved emperor. "My life ends here." "Embarking on the path of death, forever parting. How sad it is." "But still, I want to walk the path of life." She must have seen herself in Kiritsubo, Even in the face of death, She still cherished her beloved, wanting to continue living. Cherishing my father... And you, Mr. Kanji. Mr. Kanji? Were you crying? Huh? I wasn't crying! Brother, thank you for your guidance. I should be the one thanking you. You have a bit of the boss's temperament, Shiori. I felt that way the first time we met. So I thought to myself, maybe you could change this brewery. Oh, come on... oh. Alright, let's get on the road to Tokyo! Shiori! Take care! Miss Misaki, you should also have a healthy baby. Mm. Goodbye then. Here, take this as a farewell gift. Can I open it? Use this to drink "Seeking Life" together another day. Okay. Goodbye. Mr. Kanji. I…
