Quickly. When will the 22-year vintage arrive? Please wait a bit longer. First of all, we will punish her and take out the spoiled fruit. It's fine here. I don't want this ugly face to be seen by that mean lady. This distance is good enough for me. Yes. Rotten fruits must be taken out. You come here instead. I have no more use for you. Be prepared. No. No! How are you feeling inside? I feel so good. Please don't kill me. Hey, come in. No! Sister, it will be here soon. I'll be healthy, as I used to be. Then, I won't let Yamada and his people do what they want. This hotel is useless without me. Before anything else, bring it to me when it arrives.

Now is the time to make Japan better, to make it a country with future and vitality. Shitty old man. "Make Japan better," eh? Bullshit. He won't be long. Our cabinet is going to take economic policy... Thank you. ...and give the highest priority to national interests. It's not difficult to return to being a great economic power, Rebuild Japan! For the children who will live in the future, I will exert myself to the utmost. You are with the girl, aren't you? The girl? Who? It's been a long time. -Hi.

You did well, you bitch. Do you know what sorrow is? Hey! Can you understand what sorrow is? Sorrow? Do you know the meaning of the word "sorrow"? I'll let you live, out of respect. Would it be better if this world ended? We are creatures who are cursed in this world. Egoists. Hypocrites. We've got to survive among the creatures who'll do anything to get what they desire! Do you want to survive, too, in this crappy world of humans? Yes. We have no choice, but to win! K... Noah, look at that. - Nice. - No, K. Speak Romanian. No, come somewhere. Okay, take your time. You can speak the language 'cause you were born in Romania. NIGEL KENNEDY VIVALDI FOUR SEASONS HOTEL UNDER RECONSTRUCTION This is so cool! Up there! Come on! This is so cool! Hey. Write a poem on the wall again. "I would have wanted to meet you under the bluest sky. I would have wanted to fall in love with you under the most beautiful sky." "I would have wanted to meet you under the bluest sky. I would have wanted to fall in love with you under the most beautiful sky." Did I startle you? This used to be a hotel which belonged to some vampires. The clients were eaten one by one, every evening. See? Human blood. Over there as well. Here as well. Where do you come from? We're from Japan. Exchange students from Japan. K. In Romanian! Follow me. This passageway is connected to different places around the world. Follow me. You'll really love it. This is a salt mine. It has a very long history. Salt was extracted since the year 50 BC. The walls are made entirely of salt crystals. Even if the entire world were to come and live here, they would have enough salt for more than a century. Salt? Indeed. - Yes. - To live off this? For a century? Even so, to live here is terrible. We're almost at Corvin's palace. Corvin's palace? It's the castle of the guy who slew Dracula. Today is the day when Corvin slew Dracula. So, the festival is about to start. A festival? How cool is that? Hello? Hi! This is Noah speaking. Hey! How are you? You're drawing today as well? Yes. A Hungarian king built this castle at the beginning of the 14th century. Some changes were made in the 15th century by John Hunyadi. His son, Matthias Corvinus, is famous for having imprisoned here Prince Dracula, also known as Vlad the Impaler. Prince Dracula was framed and kidnapped. Matthias Corvinus exaggerated his deeds to defend his own actions. It seems that today is the day on which he killed him. That's it! Your time is up! You have nowhere to run to! Lola! Maybe you woke up. Where are we? In Japanese, please. Ah! Mother. Daughter, you like this song, don't you? I love this song. It's really wonderful. Mother, let's dance to the song together. We're in Japan. Perhaps, I do. This song is my favorite. She's my daughter. She was born in 1862. I was born in 1436. I'm Elizabeth Báthory. A 154-year-old maiden. I'm Yamada. I forgot my age. Pleased to meet you. By the way, I had a little taste of Noah. Look at your neck. Yeah, there. There are two red traces of fangs, right? Noah's blood was so very delicious, having Romanian blood. Please take your time and become our slaves here. Come here, Noah. - Come here. - Come here. Noah? - Quickly. - Quickly. Quickly. K, your Japanese blood is too normal to drink, so I didn't drink yours at all. Get out of here! Let go of me! Noah! Noah! Wait! Noah! Noah! I'll let you become the prey of our musty ancestors underground. You don't need to be here. Go underground! Noah! Hands up! Wake up already. Yamada took Manami away. K, where did Yamada go? It must be there, of course. Hotel Requiem. All the guests at this event will be given money. 100,000 yen for men and 150,000 yen for women. And 1 million yen for those who successfully become couples. Everyone, it seems everybody's here now. In any case, you will play the lead role tonight. If you are real men and women, your rooms tonight, I mean, beds, will go wild like petrol catching fire. Tonight, we have prepared wonderful suites for each one of you. Of course, people who don't find a partner can stay here. But the best thing is to find a partner and stay here. Everyone, please move to the salon here. Hey, let's go up the stairs. That way, there. Come on. Here. -Welcome. -Here, here! Welcome. Elizabeth. Sorry that these got damaged. Thank you. PRIME MINISTER JIRO YAMADA PRESS CONFERENCE In order to build a better society, we have to look towards the future now to make a healthy society for our children who will succeed us in the future. This country now is anxious because of the unknown future ahead. An important country which has the future... What does he mean, Japan's future? "Children are treasures," my ass. I sincerely ask you... Idiot! Shut up! I will work with all my might for this country to be a prime minister who our people can entrust with their lives. It's so painful but I can't do anything about it. I'm going to kill you! I'm going to kill you! Someone useless like him became our prime minister. Oh, dear. You seem to be doing very well. I can't succeed in this hotel business because you are still hanging around in this world. We're here! I brought the one named Manami. Who is this ugly, disgusting woman? Is this girl "the one"? There's no mistake. Let me see your face. Such a lame woman. It's not smart. Where are your brains? I wanna try it out. Hey, it's a mistake, isn't it? Have we so desperately been looking for such a woman? You're judging a book by its covers. It's what's inside that matters. What does it taste like? See? It's nothing. We have two more hours until the end. Let's focus on the real one who's among us. The 22-year-old vintage has matured. It's strictly dependent on time. This one is still 21 years old in human time. She'll turn 22 in two hours. GIVE ME SOME BLOOD. It's still too early. Let's cover her. Isn't that enough? That's why I didn't want to adopt an orphan. What brought that up all of a sudden? What are we gonna do? Can't you say something, not just sigh? I'm at my limit. For me, too. Is there any more meat? - Want more? - No. No, I still have some, let me eat it first. - It's been a long time. - Yeah. What are we gonna do with Manami? What shall we do? Are you thinking about it seriously? Sorry. I'm leaving. To tell you the truth, you're not my daughter. You're an orphan. Thank you very much. Hey. You're so cute. Where are you going? The night is long. The lonely night is long. What am I living for? I'm always unwell. I feel I won't ever be able to die. I feel I will live forever, hiding in the dark. I feel the hopeless night of grief will be endless! Sorry. Biting is a bad habit of mine. It's almost the time for happy birthday! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! You're an orphan Get out from here! Monster! Monster! The wine will spill! You're no longer human! Do you want to run away? I don't mind. Hey, catch her! It's okay. You're an ophan. I don't need you. Get the gell outta here! Hindrance! Because i don't need you... I can see you wherever you go. Monster.... You're a monster! I found her. We are on your side, Manami. Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Gen. This event is sick, isn't it? Just being here gets me 100,000 yen. I thought it would be a lie. I can't believe I got 100,000 yen in cash at the entrance. How did you feel when you got the envelope? You'll get 1 million yen when you find a partner, right? I'm sure people are keen to find one. The atmosphere in this place really is amazing. In terms of scale, you can't hope for anything bigger. Ciao. So, what made you come here? Are you here to find a desperately out-of-fashion man? Or for a one-night stand? -She could be. -You're mysterious. Me? Hey, hey. We introduced ourselves. Hi. I'm Noah. How do you do? Hi, I'm Blue. -I'm Red. -I'm Yellow. Strange names. We've been calling each other those names since we started our companies 3 years ago. See you later. It seems just finding a partner will give me 1 million yen, so let's get it without fail. I'm good at it. -Come here. -Who are you? Whatever. Just follow me. I'm on your side. I'll get you out of here. Let go of me. -Let me go. -Noah. What are you doing? I was just about to take her to a room. You should go there, then. That's right. We've got a problem! You've got to be patient for a while. Come upstairs as planned. It's okay. SUPER WORLD! LET'S LIVE HERE Everybody. Let's live here. Super World! Everybody, let's live here. Super World!

SPECIAL COUPLING PARTY Everyone who came here today, the world will end tonight! -The start of this speech had a punch. -Yeah. But you don't need to worry. This hotel is sturdy. All of us here are going to survive! I don't care about your nonsense. We could survive together. Give and take. Now, vampires and humans need each other! Is that good? From today, you won't be able to go out of this hotel for 100 years. What are you talking about, bitch? What do you mean "vampire"? She must be crazy. -I'm leaving now. -Where's the exit? What nonsense. Let's go home. Hey! Listen up, everybody. Let's live here for 100 years until the time when we go out to the overground! -What is she talking about? -We'll be okay. Calm down. We're gonna keep the lights turned out until you regain calm. What are you talking about? Listen up, for the next 100 years, let's live here together! Please, be happy. Enjoy free love here. Please get more and more happy. The effect of the blood ended, right? Were you the one who killed my lovely Nadi, Daddy and Jessi? I found them. Three pieces in all. That's good. Now, everybody. The time is upon us, when the world will end! Look at the back, there. What can you see? Look to the right, next. Look at the right-hand side! That's Tokyo, seen from Odaiba. Yay! Look at the back. That's Tokyo, seen from Ebisu area. Yay! Come on, look around. Look around, all around you, all directions. Without a doubt, it's your Tokyo! It'll end, in 10 seconds. It'll end in 10 seconds! Everybody, look! Look in the direction of your house. Or imagine your birth place somewhere beyond Tokyo. Here we go, now. Here we go! Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Be quiet! I'm gonna call out your names. Those whose names are called, go! Mari Kayama. Yoichiro Sakuma. Takumi Kaga. Genki Sawamura. - Taichi Kamiyama. - Understand? Let's get back in touch later. - Kimie Fujou. - We'll get out from here for sure. Keiko Aida. Saki. Risa, let's meet up again later. Don't leave me Ami Nagashima. - Urara Higuchi - I'm going now. Eri Kawase. Wait. No! Wait! - Saki, I'm scared. - We'll be all right. Risa Ito. See you again soon. Saki! What's gonna happen to us? - We're gonna have fun. - What? Are you ready to live here for the rest of your life? Get ready. What's with these? They're guns, aren't they? What were they? Do you want to know? What are these? Awesome. - Are they real? - They are all real. Why are they here? Because they're interesting. Let's conduct an experiment. Don't you feel like killing us with the gun? Indeed, I do. Are you going to shoot me? Are you going to shoot me? Come on, please shoot me. That was enough, wasn't it? Let's just go to your rooms for now. They won't work on us. But if we're shot many times, we won't be able to get up for a while. You want to try it, too? But if you did, I would truly get furious. Genki Sawamura. - Later. - Yeah. She's inside Sit down on the bed again. - Tell me what's going on here. - Quiet! You did well. I'll be back soon. What I wouldn't give to hold you in my arms right now. Thank you. Come on, let's go. Run. Hang in there. Look at this. What happened to you? Quickly. Bring her to me. Hasn't she fully matured yet? Just a little longer. I will die if I don't drink it right now. Bring her to me! - Understood. - Do you understand? Let's bring her here right now. Yes. Do that. I'll be waiting! I'm going. Huh? Hey! There's nobody here! That's strange. You can see her on this monitor. We can't see Yamada. What? What's going on here? Intruders! Mother, I'll do something about it right away. It went as we planned. Stole the invitation letter, sneaked into the hotel, and return back underground. Everything went very well. I'll show you the way from here. Nobody can open this door except for those with Corvin's blood. Only people who have the same bloodline can open it. Who am I? Tell me. You were born on the special day in a place predicted. And ancient blood was introduced into your body. Since then, it has been blending into your body, slowly. But... What are you talking about? Who am I? Who are you? This smell... What a wonderful smell of blood! Let's go. Wait! You, children born under luckless stars. You, the children chosen by Dracula, save us. What are they saying? You now have a power you know nothing about. What are you talking about? In 1999, When the Grand Cross took place in the solar system, three babies were born. I... I know it. I remember it. Somebody is calling me. Except you, the other two died before they reached adulthood. One of them killed herself. You're the only one who survived up to the age of 22. We've been waiting for 22 years for this moment. And from the castle of the Corvin clan, the accursed ones who rebelled, they banished us to the underground. We who are descendants of Dracula's bloodline. She's here. Welcome back, Manami. It's good to have you back! I'm glad you've returned, my lady. Welcome back. It's so good to have you back. I brought her. I am Dracula's descendant. You've done well. For you, I'd do anything. I love you. Me, too. In the year 1999, at 9 seconds past 9:09 a.m. This is Manami. Master. Finally, this drink has arrived. The time to fight the Corvin clan has finally come! How we've waited for this moment! We, who have a long history, we who are of Dracula's pure blood, we've been banished underground. We've been treated like slaves. Enough! From this day on... ...everything will be over. Many have waited for this day. Even those from Corvin's clan. Where is this? You no longer have to be afraid. Let's get together. For everyone Who are you? I am a Japanese university student who came to Romania to study five years ago. And then I turned into a vampire of the Dracula clan. I am the one who was sent to bring you here. Is this overground Japan? No, it isn't. The underground is underground. This is connected to every place in the world. You have been with us since you were born. I'll go. Would you do this for me? I'll go get her. Very well. Now, the two will go to Japan and will fight the evil there. We'll be going to Romania and we'll fight all of the evil. As for you, all of us from the Dracula clan must share you. You will continue to give us your blood from now on as well. I'm losing my senses. My consciousness is fading. You will give even the last drop for the prosperity of our clan. I'll be fighting here as well. You'll have to handle things in Japan. - But... - When everything will be over, I'm thinking that you can be my wife. Do you understand? When everything is over, I'll head straight back to Japan. K, when Romania is once again under my power, I'll come back to you. And then, I'll hold you tightly in my arms once again. I'll be waiting for you. Is somebody here? It's you. I'm Ami. Pleased to meet you. I'm Gen. You all right? Of course not! Hey, I'm Red. Let me join you guys. Are you Ami? Risa. Ami...I'm so glad you're next door. What's happening? We're going to fight and escape from here. Are you serious? Fight them? We don't have any other choice but to fight. Knock on all the doors and get the guys out. Maybe we can do something. I want to help, too. There's work for women. Right. Let's stand up to them! Ichiro! Saburo! Get out. Saki, are you there? Ami! - Saki! - Ami. I'm so scared. - Let's go together. - I'll be okay as long as i'm with you . Hey! Blue! Yellow! Aiko. Yuri. Ichiro! Saburo! - What's happening? - Come with us. Gen! - Find Ichiro. - Okay. - Ichiro! - Let's go. Come out, everyone! Mother. Mother! Mother's dead. Yamada rules the world now. That woman raised me up, as a vampire. My father is now a Prime Minister, after having sold me. It's a deal. Get rid of me. Now let it end. Everything is boring. Let's end this annoying reality. I don't wanna let beautiful flowers die anymore. Let's stop this sorrowful snow. Let's put an end to the sorrow now. My time.... My breath... My heart.... I beg you, put an end to the flow of time. Elizabeth... Elizabeth. I want these days to end. I want to erase all these remaining years. Elizabeth. With the star called love, shall we fall into the abyss together? My beloved lady of destruction... Elizabeth... Noah, you're useless. I also want to fight alongside you. You're not being helpful sucking Manami's blood. Don't follow me. Stay here. I love you. - K, I love you! - Stop. K, I've been loving you for years. I've loved you since we've been together in Romania. Why don't you speak Romanian? This is Japan. "K, I want to suck your blood." What are you saying? You never wanted to accept my feelings! Not even when we were in Romania! Noah, I love you, too. I will always love you. You're lying! I love you, but I can't take you with me into battle. Stay here. I want to be with you. I love you. Forgive me. Let's go, Manami. I'm going to fight, too. Why aren't you sucking my blood? There's blood that's worth more than yours. That I will suck until the last drop. I will destroy everything, too. Quickly! Go! Here we come! Seems like they already started. Humans can't beat them. Is that so? Maybe you can't beat them either. I'm going first. Set fire to their shadows. They are ignitable. Burning shadows will slow them down. You can burn your hair and throw it to the shadow. Their shadows are easy to burn. Meanwhile, we'll chop off their heads. Or shoot them in the head. What are they? They are vampires. The owner and staff here are all vampires. Let's go, Manami. All right. It's time. My goal is different from yours. It's okay. Let us come with you anyway. Nobody's here. We might be able to survive. This is a trap. Why? This is our chance! Don't go. Let's go! Yeah, let's go. Wait, they're downstairs. Here. I'm giving this back to you. So you still follow the old ways. Funny to see you scared of the cross. As is expected of one of the Dracula clan. I've finally found you. There's no point in trying, K. You have to watch till the very end. She'll suck all her dirty blood. Watch carefully, okay? Hurry. Please wait. Don't remove your shoes! Yes, ma'am. That is noble blood. I'm not going to let you barbaric vampires... Shut up. I'm invincible. I love you, Yamada. Get her! She'll be captured soon. In the meantime, let's deal with her. There are a lot of losers in there. I hope you get along well. When you return, you shall be my wife. Really? Forever. Understood. What is this place? We are all drop-outs that couldn't stand the forced sex in this hotel. Some of them are here because they rebelled against the vampires. Don't think of getting out. Just give up. There's no way of escaping. Use this knife to get blood from your own body. That is our duty. This hotel sucks blood. You're not going to fight? We don't fight a losing battle. Move! - Where are you going? - Far away. Flesh for humans. Blood for vampires. Flesh for humans. Blood for vampires. Flesh for humans. Blood for vampires. Everyone. Thank you for gathering. Let's start over. A special coupling party! We're doing this again! The incident that this rebellious group caused just now, unfortunately ended in epic failure. And you are all responsible for it. From now on, I'll give you all just 10 minutes. Within that time, have sex! Find your own sex partner. You don't have any time to waste. Those who successfully form a couple, shout out...

If you don't find one soon, you'll be our prey. Where are you, Red? I... No! Oh, no! Forty-two... Forty-one... It can't be helped. It really can't be helped. Why not become a vampire? That's a good idea. Please look at the monitor. Seven minutes and thirty-eight seconds. Thirty-seven... Thirty-six... Thirty-five... Over here! Time is rapidly running out. We've formed a couple!

Where's the exit of this world? Where's the exit of this star? Where's the exit of this universe? Where is it? My exit. Give me back my feelings. Give me back my inner emotions. It's just strange. It's just strange. It's just strange here. There's no feeling here. Give me back my soul. Where is it? Where's the exit? For example, my old clock. My socks hanging on the drying rack. Clothes. Rape-flowers that tremble in the wind. Me running on the Great Plains. Give them back! Give me everything back! Give them back! Give me back everything! Give them back! Give them back. - Manami! - Where are you, Manami? Did you have dinner at the hotel? No. So you haven't tasted the others yet. That is the meat of us humans. Use this to draw your own blood and nourish this hotel. Romania is waiting for me. Everything will be fine if I go back. Everything will be fine? Take us with you. Somewhere far away! Let me go. Where is this? This is the hotel. The hotel is made out of meat. The surface is cold concrete. But the inside is warm meat. Made out of just one person. The princess is over that way! Be careful! She is the hotel. Let go! Take me to Romania, too. You're just going to get killed if you go near the princess. Don't touch me! What is this? So much blood spilled! Such a waste! You... You're the true form of this hotel? This whole hotel is made up of your lower body. Stop. I'm going to suck all your power. Stop. I'm not going to fight with you. Yamada told us to watch you. Go join the humans. What happened? She escaped from me. Get out! Get out. What's that? Listen up! I'm Yamada. You humans think you can beat me? No matter how many of you attack me, I won't die. I won't die! Come on. All of you try and attack me! Shoot! Shoot me! Kill! Kill me! What the hell is this? Everyone! come! There's blood pouring out here! Somebody's cutting me. Come here! It hurts! It hurts! What are you doing here? Stop! Give it back! Give everything back to me! Give it back to me! Give everything back! Give it back! Give it back! Humans piss me off. What about them? They're always irresponsible and dishonest. Each one of them thinks he's the only one that can be kind to others. That ability, to be able to think he's the only kind person. But he's actually greedy, and even steals love. Humans are greedy bastards who steal whatever they want. And then talks about justice. When I was born, my father sold me to the owner of this hotel and became the owner of this place. He sold his son to the devil. Yamada, where did you go? I'll let you live out of respect. Let's end this, Yamada. Elizabeth I love you... You're not anybody's thing. Am I going to be the sovereign of this place one day? You don't have to. I don't care about that. I don't want to. Elizabeth. Somewhere... The two of us are always free. We are both gonna be free. We'll fly away from here one day. We'll fly away from here one day. We're back. Romania is now under our control. How's it going on your end? We're done. Good job! To be honest, we need to make some arrangements after the battle. At the order of the Dracula clan leaders from every country, we decided that you should handle Japan on your own. So, we no longer have anything to do with the hotel. You can do whatever you want once you're done. What about me? What about you? Yes. You can continue living there, at the hotel. We no longer require anything of you. At the end of the day, you're Japanese. You Japanese people do whatever you want, there in Japan. Anyway, for us, the true vampires of Romania, all of these issues with Japanese vampires and Corvin clan vampires are mere trifles. That woman, Manami, send her back to Romania. Two of my servants have arrived there. Give them Manami. I shouldn't have learned Romanian. Just now, there has been an incident on the third floor hall. Staff members, please head there immediately. Manami! Manami. Manami. Manami. I'm sorry. Look at you. I'll never let anyone take you. Let's be together. Okay. I can't. I can't shoot, Manami. K! K! Come out! K! Noah. I'll meet you in three minutes. I'll meet you in three minutes. Any witnesses? Many. Please take care of it. Got it. I'll meet you in three minutes. I'll meet you in three minutes. Noah. K. K... Kill me. I'm going to die anyway. Let's die together. I would have wanted to meet you under the bluest sky. K! We haven't seen each other in a long time. Yes, a long time. This is the day in which Corvin made up with Dracula. The festival will begin soon. Manami is the sacrifice Can I take her with me? No, you can't. Found her! Please. You've become stronger, K. Thanks to you. I would have wanted to meet you under the bluest sky. I would have wanted to fall in love with you under the most beautiful sky. I would have wanted to meet you under the bluest sky. Sing with me. Take me! Take me to Romania! Manami. I'm sick and tired of it, K! I want to go far away! Let's go together. I would have wanted to meet you under the bluest sky. I would have wanted to fall in love with you under the most beautiful sky. You've finally understood what sorrow is. K! I hate you! I hate everyone! I hate you! Good morning, Manami. Manami, dinner's ready. Coming. It looks so good. Merry Christmas! Dad. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Mom, Merry Christmas! Let's eat. Thank you for the food. You really are so ugly! You are really disgusting. Ugly? A monster. - You're not a human. - Not a human? Me? You're not a human. You're not our child. You're a monster. I'm not a monster! I'm not a monster. She's a vampire! She's one of them! You monster! I love you, K! What is it now? I would have wanted to meet you under the bluest sky. I would have wanted to fall in love with you under the most beautiful sky. Vampire. A monster. Don't fuck with humans! Subs by D&M Hepi Bday Keyayo!!😉
