What's wrong? It's hot. I'm thirsty. Eh... What? The room knows, when it's not decorated with flowers. Flowers... You don't like them? They are red. You like red, don't you? Mizuki-san. Welcome back. Thanks. Mizuki-san. Welcome back. The president is waiting upstairs. Okay'- Come in. Sorry to intrude. I have returned. Good work. I'm sorry for calling you back so suddenly. It's okay. How was New York? Did you get used to the place? I am still adjusting. Your results were excellent. But no matter how good your designs, bear in mind it doesn't necessarily sell. I understand. So... Mizuki-kun. Yes? During this period in Japan, would you like to try your hand in sales? Sales? Manager Sasaki will guide you along. Yes. A designer... is not an artist. A designer... Exactly. But President. Did you call me back just to try sales? Well then, shall we get moving? I am not done speaking with Mizuki-kun. I want you to stay in my house while you're here. So you can move in today, and start work tomorrow. That's all. Ah... but I've prepared an apartment for him. Cancel that. I understand. I'll take my leave. I have to make an urgent trip to South America today to oversee the factories over there. It might take about a month. But the two of them are already high school students. They should be able to live on their own, even if you're not there. Have you not heard anything from She'? Did something happen to She'? Shu has quit high school. But there's only another half a year to graduation. He is staying at home now. Or more like, he has holed himself up in the house. What actually happened? I don't know and it's troubling. He hasn't spoken a word to me these past three months. He is ignoring me altogether. She... might open up to you. Can you talk to him? I will. Yes? So... What's your relationship with the President? Relationship? My deceased father was a close friend of his. And so I knew him since I was a child. I see. Good for you. Becoming a designer and studying abroad though you've only just joined. You have impressive connections. Wait a minute. I took and passed the tests, and being sent abroad was decided by the company. As for the company's decision, I never agreed to it. I am in charge of the sales department. And from my point of view, there is no future for your designs. But the President gave you a helping hand. The fashion world is strict. There is no place for someone who uses connections to get in. You should stop your naive thinking. I know. I intend to ask the President to reconsider your studies abroad, based on your sales results this time. But the reason I was asked to return- What is it? It's nothing. Please guide me from here on. Going to New York? It's because I won the company's competition held for new employees. Now I go further with my design studies in New York. Are you abandoning me? What's wrung? You're overreacting. Don't do it. Don't leave me alone. You're not alone. There is uncle, and Ryuu too. I don't care. Ever since my parents died in that car accident, I got to be your tutor and entered a vocational school... It's all thanks to uncle. I respect him. I want to become a designer just like him. I know... I know. But please don't leave! Didn't you say you'd always support me until I become a designer? If I lie to father, that you've been toying around with me, he'll surely get mad. I won't be able to face him then. All you talk about is him. What is he to you? It is just three years! We're only going to be apart for three years. Are you feelings going to change then? I intend to work in uncle's company after that. You and Ryuu are the successors of the company. I want to be of help to both of you. I want to be a designer, so that I can stay by your side forever. So I have to study now. My feelings won't change. No matter what happens, I will do my best too. Attend school and do your best in swimming. I will return for sure. Who's there? It's Ritsu. Ah! Ritsu! Ritsu! Ryuu! It's only been a year, but you're sure grown quite a bit. It's my growing stage. Come in, come in! Please excuse me. Just like a Japanese meal, isn't it? These are... I made them. Really?! To think you were so tiny back then. It's delicious. Brother never says anything. Gee. What's wrong with She'? Speaking of him... He hasn't been attending school? I'll go call him. Nu, it's okay. I'll go. Sho, I'm coming in. It's been a while. You look well!! She... What's wrung? What happened? You're told to look after me. Right, Mister Pet? Pet? Get out right away. This is papa's work space, and also a guest room. He said to let you use it. What happened... to She'? Are you going to make clothes? Yeah. For the graduation fashion show. But it's still a while before you graduate from New York, right? I won't make it in time if I don't start now. Hey... Make some clothes for me. Eh? In the past, you said you had make clothes that look good on Sho, and you even drew up designs, for me too. Now that you mention it. That was when I was still a tutor, right? He was studying so hard then. All you talk about is Sho. I'm sorry. You entered the same high school, right? Congratulations. Thank you. Why? What do you mean by 'why'? You have such good grades. I thought you'd go to a better high school. Probably because Shu is there. That's true. After all, you're intelligent. Am I different from Sho? I guess so. Oh yes. Can you teach me English? English? My English is not good enough for exams. I want to able to speak. Or... are you too busy? Well... Let's do it then! Though I can't teach you much. Y ay'.! Ritsu? Ritsu! You scared me! What was that for? Sho. You're cute. Are you really a high school student? Shut up. Do you need something from Sho? Nu, not really. I am just thinking of talking to him. Shu is probably in deep slumber at this time, and you won't be able to wake him. I see. Goodnight. Goodnight. Hey Ryou. Why did Sho stop school? I'm not sure. We're not in the same year. Goodnight. Good Morning! Morning! Breakfast for you? I'll take out the miso soup for you. Sorry. I can't. I'm going to be late. Hey... I'll be leaving. I'm sorry. Don't be angry! Stop! I better get going. I'm leaving. Okay'. I'm leaving! What do you want for dinner? Eh? Hamburger steak will be good. Are you really in a rush? I'll be late. You should have just woken up earlier. Man I am hungry. Geez. Manager Sasaki. Good morning. Manager. Morning. Good morning. You probably don't know that starting this year, the fourth and fifth floor became the company's housing. Company's housing? Accommodation for the managerial staff. I didn't know that. It's not something you needed to know anyway. After your return from New York, why don't you live here too? Oh that's right. Only the higher-ups are to stay here. So I guess, you'll get here pretty soon. Oh... nothing. See you! Hey! Good morning. These shins here. What do you think? These may be to you liking... you can choose from these. What about the shape? As for the shape, we have a range for all body types. I believe it will look good on anyone. Another main point here is... It's dune. Look delicious! Boy I'm hungry. I've already called Sho, but... I'll try to get him. She'. Dinner time. She... Dinner. Ah. I knew it. He took sleeping pills again. Sleeping pills?! Relax. They are just some low dosage ones. Shu must be hungry, right? Stun it! What's with you? Sorry. You guys are not kids anymore. Don't play with food. I'm sorry. I wonder if Shu will recover. We've got to talk to him first. I don't think he'll ever return to his old self. That's a shin papa made for you, right? Yeah. As a present for graduating technical college and entering the company. I wonder if I'll get one too. I... want Shu to get better. Even his favourite color has changed. He used to like red. The one who likes red is me. Shu likes white. Eh?! Don't be so alarmed. But... Since a long time ago... Have you liked red since you were going? Yeah. Shu followed behind me all the time. Ah. Are you taking a bath? Uncle is amazing indeed. And how are you today sir? I'm... checking in. We're good now. I'm checking you in. Okay, Mister Oikawa, and are you are still planning on staying with us one night then? Too fast. One more time. Mister Oikawa. Are you still planning on staying with us just one night then? I don't have a clue what you're saying. Pay attention if you don't get it. Teach me. You bet. Follow me. You... bet. You bet. Hmm? Hey! Where are you going dressed like that? Pool. Poof? Ah. I have to stay in focus for next week's competition. You want to get into the Olympics, right? How are you going to do that acting like this? That's impossible! Idiot! You cheeky bastard... Stop there! That was sly. Idiot. What are you doing. Idiot. What are you doing! Manager! What are you doing?! What's wrong with you?! Sasaki-san. What's wrung? This guy attacked me. No! Shu was being... Where do you live sir? I'm living with the Oikawa family. Shu-kun is teaching me how to swim. I pay 3000 yen an hour. And I have paid in full for my lessons. The guard just informed me. I'm sorry. It's okay. Quick. Take your clothes off. Here? Of course. These are? Papa's. I have own in my suitcase. They have washed really clean. I don't mean that. I have made coffee. You want some? Where is Sho? He is not in his room. He is probably on the roof. The roof? Shu never leaves the apartment block. I see. I'm sorry about just now... for embarrassing you. I thought he was going to do something to you, since I saw him touching you. This! It belongs to uncle. Ryuu passed them to me. Well it is as expected. You. In his room on his bed. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you having sex with the President. Are you joking? Making fun of me? What happened to the promise we made? Did you forget? You stopped school and swimming. And slept with other men. She'.! Are you idiot? Acting all serious. Well it's as expected... You.. in his room, on his bed. I'm talking about you having sex with the President. Thank you for your time today. Likes you? I guess. Who? Who? For real?! Impossible. That teacher... Sorry. Did you wait lung? Sorry to call you out here. But it is difficult to talk at home. It's okay. Stop it. Let go and walk properly. But aren't you and Sho... What do you mean? What do I mean? Well... aren't you and Shu together? What are you saying? Shu is always with you. But you left Shu behind for New York. And during that time, Shu was being bullied at school. Who would do this? People who have not loved. Miserable beings. Shu was doing his best, but his attitude angered people around him further. And they bullied him more. Since he entered school, he was bullied for more than a year. Why... Why didn't he tell me. If he had told me... Would you have come to save him? Of course! What can you do? Even I only knew after entering high school. I could not believe he continued going to school despite all that. He put up with the bullying... to keep the promise he made with me. Isn't it all good now? Eh? Since he stopped going to school, he can continue his studies at home, and even graduate. He'll study with me, and we'll go to university together. Then we'll take papa's company over. I'll look after Shu forever. You will become a popular designer and travel around the world. So isn't that good? Though, there was only half a year more to graduation, Shu cut his 'thread'... the 'red thread' that binds the two of you, it's completely severed. What do you mean? Nothing deep. It's just what I thought. You'll soon become an active pan of the company. I'll do my best in New York. I'll definitely become a good designer by the time I return. I hope that you'll support my suns from here on. I will. I'm... not going to work today. Eh?! I want to have a proper talk with him. Okay'- I'm sorry about yesterday. Nu. I am sorry. It must have been tough on you. I'll be leaving. Have a safe journey. You're awake. This coffee is from New York. I heard from Ryou. I am sorry. I did not know anything. It must have been difficult. Stun it! How did you do it with my father? Huh? You did it with my father, didn't you?! What are you saying?! She'. What's going on'? What's going on with uncle?! You slept with my father to make the company yours! That's crazy! You went to New York, so you could meet up with my father, right? Who told you such things? Who cares who told me? That's impossible. I would never do such... Shut up! She'.! Are you going to lay your hands on Ryuu too? Wow... Are they doing it? Shu is not in the mood for it. And... after hearing that... you believed it?! It is not true! You filthy pet! Told you. What a cruel child. But I like it. You are really an idiot. A really big idiot. To be deceived by this... I don't have a mole like this! Have you forgotten? You are really an idiot. Come on. Don't stay here crying. Let's go back. You are lying. I don't believe you. You. You were being lied to. I put up with everything. I was trying my best. And yet... I received this photo of you and father... I... ended up not knowing what to do anymore. I am sorry. You were trying so hard by yourself. From now on, I always be by your side. I will always protect you. I... slept with that guy... Don't be silly. I don't care about that. What a beautiful white. I chose this in New York especially for you. It's soft. Let me take your measurements. It's different from a year ago. Ryou. The food is delicious. You acting all cheerful suddenly. It gives me the creeps. Sho. What shall we do today? While I'm alone, I'll be studying. And let's go out for dinner tonight. You two go ahead. I have to prepare for my exams. Don't be such a spoilsport. I have not been out in such along while. It's a little nerve wrecking. Locking yourself in... You made me all worried. We used to come here after my swimming practices. This place is our starting point. We even kissed. That's right. By the time you return from New York, I'll be a university student... for sure. Here's to our bright futures. From now, we'll put them up. You will do that? Yes. Thank you so much! Help me with my studies. I want to finish this before I return to New York. Besides. I am clueless about school work. I guess as much. In that case. Break Time! That's not allowed. Why? Ryuu is... asleep! I can't wait the two of us living together. Want to get our own place? Father will find out and nag. Ah! I know a place where we can be alone. The manager is living next dour, but I don't think anyone will find out. Now, now. Calm down! I don't want to! Sho. I love you. I will never let you go. Me mo. Father! Uncle... Why... You! Did you plan this all along? Nu! I can't believe this! Father. Stop! I'm giving you thirty minutes! You better be gone with your things by the time I get back to the apartment. You get it? Ritsu. No! Don't leave. Ritsu! The President flew back here in a rush, because he was worried for you. Well... You and Ritsu were getting too close. Rvuu. Yllu! This is not allowed, is it? We love each other! BE quiet! He'll never be able to work in the industry now. Ritsu! Wait for me in that park! She'.! Papa has left for Columbia. I bought a new phone for you. Though only my number is stored. You know... I'm sorry. I don't care anymore. It is not your fault. You really are not angry? I don't want to live like I did in the past. I will move forward and work harder. I see. That's great. Hey Ryou. Will you help us? Eh? About Ritsu and me. What are you saying? I only want you to understand our relationship. Papa will get angry. He is just making use of you. Besides... he can't work anymore. It's over for him. This has nothing to do with father. We just want to do what we wish to do. You want to leave the house? No matter what. I love Ritsu. I can't bear to be apart from him. That's why I need your help. Ryou. I won't let you leave. I won't hand you over to a guy like him! Eh? I bought you white flowers. I think you will like them. Ryou. I am sorry You must be in shock. But it can't be helped. What are you doing?! We are brothers! I don't care. What's this? Sho. You belong to me. I won't give you up! Have you... been spying on me? Stun it! Ritsu is waiting for me.
