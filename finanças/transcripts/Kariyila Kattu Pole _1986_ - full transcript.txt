Appu Pillai.. Appu Pillai.. Oh, no. Is it morning already? - Of course. I think he's already up. Give it here.. Oh, no. She was late to bring the milk. I scolded her. Tea, sir. Hello. Is this the police station? I'm calling from Mr. Harikrishnan's house. Answer the phone. Anil! Anil? Hello? Yes. Yes, this is the DySP's house. I'll call him over. Brother, it's from the station. Ask them what the matter is. - It's an emergency. Ask them for yourself. Hello, DySP here. Yes. What? Who? You mean the film director? Who? You mean the film director? Yes.. Who informed the police? Have you sent our men there? Has the corpse been tampered with? Okay. That's sad. I'll be there soon. Really unfortunate. - Who has expired? Harikrishnan. - Our Harikrishnan? The very same. Harikrishnan, the film director. How? - He was murdered. Who murdered him? - Someone. This would turn out to be a sensation. Where did it happen? - At his house. At his workplace. If anyone calls, let them know that I'm heading to the station. Move aside.. Move aside.. Move aside.. Give some space, kids. Move.. Ask them to step aside.. - Move away! Move. He's the watchman. Instant attack. - Sir. It belongs to a woman. - Mark it. - Sir. When they bring the dog in here instruct the rest not to touch anything. You must supervise them. - Sir. It's getting crowded outside. It'll be difficult if we delay to move the body. Few reporters are present here. They'll create a commotion. - Nobody should be allowed inside. Only close relatives and policemen should be allowed inside. - Sir. You can't enter. Certain formalities are taking place right now. There's no entry. Sir, I'm his.. - Be it anyone, you'll have to wait. Please tell them, too. His family is here. Okay. Don't let them in for now. Let them in only after the finger print and forensic work is done. They should be permitted only after Simon's approval. Go now. - Sir. Rajasekharan Nair, bring the watchman. Rajasekharan Nair, bring the watchman. Appunni, are you the first one to have seen the body? - Yes. How? - When I went to serve the tea. What was the time then? - Nearly 6:30 a.m. It was early in the morning. Does he normally wake up at that time? Sometimes he wakes up even before that. He likes to wake up early in the morning. Does he wake up early to write the script? - Yes. 'Smoking is injurious to health.' Is the house and its plot under his ownership? Yes. The cottage was built by him so that he could write peacefully. He has another house in the city. Yes. But still, he stays here whenever there is any work. Won't he go to that house at that time? - No. How many days does he stay without going home? Till the work ends. Sometimes he had stayed continuously up to two months. Won't he go to his house at that time? No, he won't go anywhere. At that time, he has nothing in his mind except the script. How about his wife? - He used to call her through the phone. Nothing more. Sometimes, she comes here. Sometimes, she comes here. Who else comes here? - Not many.. There must be someone. Producers, film stars.. New comers? Quite a few people come here to meet him. Male or female? - Both. To get a chance in the film? - Yes. He found this place so that he can avoid such nuisance. Yet, some people come here. Appunni, do you get drunk often? I can see it in your face. - Yes, I do. How's it? Daily or whenever you get? Not daily.. but.. So, you drink daily. Does your master give it to you? - No. I have never gone in front of him drunk. If I feel that I smell, I don't come out. I stay in the kitchen itself. When did you meet him the last time? Evening. I went outside in the evening. I went outside in the evening. What was the time? - Almost 5 p.m. Did you ask his permission before you left? - Yes. At what time did you return? - At midnight. He told me to keep the food on the table. Whenever he says that, it means I can return at any time. Whenever he gives you permission, you get drunk, don't you? So yesterday, when he told you to keep the food on the table you got drunk heavily, didn't you? Yesterday, I drank a lot. Did you meet him after that? - No. I made sounds like coughing to make him notice that I came. Did you see someone else there? No. The light in his room was on. I thought he was writing. So, I didn't go to his room. Why? - I told you.. I won't go in front of him if I'm drunk. Usually he would call me if he requires anything. We got an evidence. A slipper. Slipper? Sir, a ladies slipper. Just one or a pair? A single one. - Our dog found it by picking up the smell. Where was it? - Near the corridor. Did he have any guests yesterday? - No. Day before yesterday? - He was here for the last nine days. I'm sure that no one entered the compound except me and the milk-woman. You must come to the station, Appu Pillai. I have some more questions. Please, sir. He is the reason that I'm still alive. Please don't distrust me. Get lost! It was covered with sand but the dog pulled it out. Tell Simon to seal the door and the gate after the body has been sent for post-mortem. after the body has been sent for post-mortem. Assign two constables as well. Keep the people away. Everybody move aside. Move! Move! Move aside! Congratulations. What for? Your good time has started. I saw you on TV. From tomorrow on your life is about to change. Your photo will be published in the film weekly. Your interrogation with the actors and actress.. I get goose bumps. I will question only the male actors. The actresses will be left alone with a kiss. Get lost! The case is a big headache. I'm getting phone calls from ministers, media and even college students. Around half an hour back a young girl called me and she was literally crying through the phone. She was saying that the police is irresponsible. Even though people talk different things about him he has a huge fan base. He was at the peak of his career. His death will only give him more recognition. He proved that we should die at our best time. Anyway, it is a cruel case. The only writer that I wanted to meet from the film industry was him. He was a real artist. I have bought a pint. Let's celebrate. This is the first case you got after the promotion. Superb! There is no thrill in investigating ordinary murder cases. But now if you solve it, you will become famous. I will be famous even if I don't solve it. But it will be unpleasant. But it will be unpleasant. From where did the lady board your auto rickshaw? Near the bus stand. What was the time then? Almost 7:30 p.m. Was she looking suspicious then? - No. Then, when did you begin to doubt her? When I saw the news in the newspaper. Was there any reason for you to doubt her? I read in the newspaper that the suspect is a lady. Why did you doubt her? I dropped her near Harikrishnan's cottage. There were no other houses nearby. How far was the cottage from the place where you dropped her? Very close. Almost 1 furlong. Have you ever been to the cottage before? Yes. - When? Many times. - With whom? I have taken many people there. Did you know him personally? - Yes, I knew him. Can you tell me her age? I don't know exactly. But she looked young. What was she wearing? - Sari. What was the colour? I think it was grey in colour. Can you recognise her if you see her again? Can you recognise her if you see her again? It's difficult.. I don't remember her face clearly. I haven't seen her here before. How long have you been married? Three years. They just celebrated their anniversary. I have heard that your family opposed your marriage with him. What was the reason? Was it because he was a script writer? Yes, mainly it was the reason. And also, Ragini got a proposal from a renowned family. Who are you? - I'm her aunt. What's your name? - Leelamma. Do you stay here with her? - Yes. How long has it been? Almost for the last six years. As Harikrishnan was busy with his work I came here to help Ragini. For the last six years? - Yes. I will talk to you later. No need to answer the questions that are asked to Ragini. Do you understand? Please sit. At this stage, it will be helpful for both of us if you answer the questions truthfully. You know it, don't you? How was your married life? I mean.. It was fine. That means, you didn't have any family problems, did you? Every family has problems. There was no exception here as well. But I heard an entirely different story. I've heard that Harikrishnan had relationships with many women and that was the reason behind all your problems. It's a lie. It's a lie. It's a made up story. Do you use handkerchief often? I mean, is it a habit? No, it's not. You might use a kerchief whenever you go out, right? Not very often. Sometimes I use it. Can I see your handkerchief? Just unfold it. Do you often use these type of handkerchiefs? No. Is this yours? No. - Haven't you seen it before? No. Have you seen this type of kerchief with any of the ladies that have come here? No. Can you put this slipper on? Please, put it on. Thank you. Now, you wear this. Sorry, I won't use slippers that other people have used. I'm allergic. I'm not asking you to use it. I want to check the measurement. We got this slipper from the place of the incident. Why are you making us wear this? As the suspect is a lady.. and as you said that he didn't have relationships with other women whom else should I ask to wear this? Please come with me. Have you ever seen Harikrishnan beating his wife? He was not that type of a man. Any commotion due to the difference in opinion? I haven't heard anything. They had problems that any ordinary family would have. Was not being blessed with a child a problem between them? Normally, it's a.. - I don't think that was ever a problem. Do you know who was the impotent one? I never asked them about it. Still.. - I think, it's him. Ragini might not be having any problems. No women in our family has suffered this problem. Do you know his close friends? He didn't have many friends. We can say that he didn't have any friends. He was always busy with his work. There might be someone. Everyone would have a long-time friend that knows all our secrets. Who might that be? There was a guy named Menon. He was the only one who was close to him. He was the only one who was close to him. Is he from the film industry? No. He is an officer in New India Chemicals. I know him since the time we were in school. We were also studied in the same college. He opted Literature and I was in Chemistry. Where are his parents? Mom.. He considered my mom as his own. He lost his mother when he was a child. His father is still alive.. in his native place. He is old now. - Did he have any brothers or sisters? No. You were friends with him when he got married to Ragini, right? Yes. How did they marry? I was the one who took the initiative to get them married. Ragini was a huge fan of Hari. Then the relation went to a different level. Even though she knew that he had other relationships she was still willing to marry him going against her family. I know that. After that, how did the problems begin? It was supposed to! A girl will only know what it means to be a wife after getting married. But what I heard was that she used to swear at him when he got calls from other women. It's true. Their relationship started in a dispute and ended in a war. Ragini used to tell us the complete details about all their fights. Sometimes we had to interfere. But we stopped after a while. I heard that your relationship with them haven't been good since the last one and a half years. Yes, it's true. What was the reason? The reason.. Have you heard about the actress Thulasi? Of course. She is the present rising star. There were some gossips about her and an actor. Yes, that's her. Hari was the one who found her, introduced her and made her a star. She came from a poor background. The media made many gossips about her and Hari. That made Ragini furious. She used to come here to talk about her problems. It was a regular. We used to console her. One day, Ragini came here unexpectedly. She was all furious. Who told you about it through the phone? He didn't tell the name. It's just an anonymous call. I don't care whether it is anonymous or genuine. I want to know the truth. If I knew where she lived, I wouldn't have bothered you. What should I say? Do one thing.. wait here. I will find where Hari is. No, that's not enough. You are close friends. So, you will try to save him. It will be a disgrace if someone comes to know about this. That's why I came here without asking anyone else. Can you show me her house? Nevertheless, I'll find her. I will have to ask someone else. No, don't. Go with her. Wait, I'll come. You can come in as well. If you are planning to elope with her no need to waste your time. I had to see this. You want to be a star? If he is the director, any tramp like you can become stars. This is the reason why the media gossips about you. And a mother to support her. - Don't talk rubbish! Mom, please don't! What did you.. - Stop it, Ragini! Don't create a scene here. - Don't create a scene? If I don't stop you now, tell me, when will I? She is just an artist who is currently working in my film. I have many things to discuss with her. You may do as you wish. But let everyone know about your discussions. She is shameless. People don't know her. But what about you? But what about you? You must have manipulated her, right? I didn't know that your advices were meant to destroy my family. What will I gain by doing that? You might.. If a husband does it.. why can't a wife? Right? Hari! Don't talk rubbish. How dare you, dog! I know what you really are. You are trying to destroy my social image with the intention of getting attached to her, right? A film maker is supposed to meet many people. Including women.. If you interfere in my matters again I will break your spine. Go inside. After that we never spoke. After that we never spoke. That girl became a star after her first film. She became a superstar after Hari's next film. But some problems emerged between the two of them. I doubt a woman.. It's Ragini. I don't think that she can kill a man like Harikrishnan alone. There might have been someone who helped her. Might be another woman.. or it could be a man too. If I find evidence against Ragini I might even doubt you as your family was the only one who was close to Ragini. Greetings, sir. The manager went out. He has to come, if you want a date for the shoot. Is Thulasi here? - Yes. Where? - She's inside. She is applying make-up. Aren't you Malayalis? - Yes. Then why can't you speak in Malayalam? We used to work mainly with Tamilians. We used to work mainly with Tamilians. So, we got adjusted to it. - Oh! I want to see Thulasi. It's not possible. The director is waiting for her. She must get there as soon as possible. Yesterday, she got here at 2 a.m. You won't get her date this year. I didn't come here for any date. I'm a police officer and I am here to question her regarding a murder case. Call her. Harikrishnan's.. - Yes, right. Sir, if you question her now, she will lose her interest to act today and the shooting will get cancelled. We will come in the evening.. - Evening? I've no time. Please call her. She is applying make-up. That's not a problem. Sit, please. Rest of you may go. Sir, I'm innocent. The media is the one who wrote these rubbish. I swear, I'm innocent. Did you bribe anyone to halt Harikrishnan's film shooting? Did you threaten his wife through the phone? You mean.. - Did you tell anyone that either you or him will only be there in the industry next year? Who told you about his death? Someone. - Someone? Tell me the truth. Or else, I'll arrest you right now. You can shoot your film in the jail. - No, sir. Please. I don't know anything. We were not on good terms. Other than that, I have nothing to do with this case. Where were you when he got murdered? On the 18th of January? On the 18th of January? I was at the shooting. Where? Here or in Madras? Here itself. I came from Madras on 17th. Which film were you doing? It was produced by KR movies. Directed by Surya Prakash. What was name of the film? - 'Share the sadness together.' Where was the shooting? - At the beach. We were filming the duet. The shooting started at 6 in the morning and ended at 2 a.m. I came to know about the incident only when my mom told me in the morning. Do you use sleeping pills before you go to sleep? Yes, sir. It's been a while, Anil. I had.. a test. A test on Computer course. I was preparing for that. I had tried to contact Shilpa. Please, sit. I think she's sleeping. I'll call her. Hello. You must be mourning your favourite director's death. Is that why you have all his movies here? Are you still angry with me? Can we go for a drive? I will be waiting for you in the library. Be there. I will be waiting for you in the library. Be there. Why now? That's not a problem. Please come. My teacher will be here soon. Which teacher? - My tuition sir. When? - Now itself. He will be here at sharp 12 p.m. There are still three minutes left. Let's leave before he comes. He will he here soon. My mom corrects the clock according to his arrival and departure. We can bunk the class. Then he will leave. I have tuition. That too maths tuition. I don't know anything about maths. Don't worry. I will teach you. Good afternoon, sir. Hello, Mr. Anilkumar. How are you? Nothing, sir. When teachers like you go around giving tuitions it's people like me who get into trouble. - How? Well.. We can't afford tuition. Well.. We can't afford tuition. Why do students like you need tuition? Even without any tuition, you are a rank holder. Sir, don't you use a watch? No. Are you using a pocket watch like Gandhi? No. Are you wondering how I am so punctual without using a watch? - Yes. A lot of them have asked me the same question. I think, I'll lose my punctuality if I wore a watch. Come.. I am ready to buy you a Rolex watch in order for your time table to go wrong. There is no information about the sender. It's posted from within the city. The content is.. 'I know you're trying to avoid me.' 'A man travelling through a wrong path' 'will try to run away from it.' 'Please, leave me or let me leave.' 'Or else, you might have to fear me every time.' This letter is more like a threat. Look at the handwriting and tell me whose it is. It looks like a woman's handwriting. It's written by a girl. I've verified it by the experts. Do you have any idea about the identity of the sender? No, I don't know. Do you know this girl? I don't know her. - Please try to remember. Haven't you ever seen her? No. Are you sure? - Yes. It might be a girl who sent her photo for the audition. - No. She is not from that group. She might have been selected from the group. Maybe. This is his last diary. It's from last year till this January. He wrote the diary till November without any fail. But, it literally ended after some days. He stopped writing on November 21st and he started writing again He stopped writing on November 21st and he started writing again on January 1st. That was his last note. He died on January 18th. Between these dates, he didn't write anything. It's practically blank. We can find a word in some pages. In the last sheet, he wrote, 'It's January 1st..' 'My dilapidated house has seen many people come and go.' 'She is coming today.' 'I knew she would come to me in the end.' 'No matter what.' 'My last 17 years were full of ignorance.' 'She has awakened my inner self.' 'To become a mere existence for the rest of my life.' 'She is here with her first New Year present for me.' 'Today is January 1st..' 'My dilapidated house has seen many people come and go.' 'My dilapidated house has seen many people come and go.' 'She is coming today.' 'I knew she would come to me in the end.' 'No matter what.' 'My last 17 years were full of ignorance.' 'She has awakened my inner self.' 'To become a mere existence for the rest of my life.' 'She's here with her first New Year present for me.' He is referring to the same girl in the last page that he wrote. That is on November 21st. It starts like.. 'Book release..' 'I still have doubts.' 'Is it her? Please Lord, let it be her.' That's all. He wrote this on November 21st. The letter was posted on November 23rd. Can you find any connection between them? I don't understand anything. When I saw the word book release, I verified it and found out that, it was the day on which and found out that, it was the day on which one of his novels was released. That is right. Do you remember anything particular about that day? I do. That was the day when his last novel was released. Where was it held? At the Town Hall. Did you go with him to the Town Hall? I did. Do you normally go with him for these kind of functions? No. Normally, I don't. In his world that he lives in and in the reality of that world I have always felt like a stranger. He never invited me in to it. But on that particular day unexpectedly, he invited me to it. So, when he invited me that day I felt really happy. It was after a long time that we went out together. Gentlemen, the main guest has arrived. Make way.. - We will start the function soon. Make way.. - We will start the function soon. I am a little late. It is all right. We can start now. Come on. Greetings. - Make way.. Today, we hear that the cinemas are the art of the century or the media of the century. It might be because of my lack of knowledge that I can never compare cinema with any other art forms. Also, I don't watch cinemas. Normally, when a writer enters the world of cinema he is a great loss for literature. There are a lot of examples. We have seen the popularity, fame and money the world of cinema provide, pulling in so many true writers with its tentacles. This is the truth, no matter what anyone says. This is the truth, no matter what anyone says. We salute Mr. Harikrishnan, for this achievement of his. We need to understand one thing. After staying away from literature for some time he has made his comeback with this big achievement. This is the biggest achievement, Malayalam literature has received in the recent years. What happened? I am having a sudden headache and shivering. All this excitement might have increased my blood pressure. What? What is it, sir? There are a lot of doctors among the audience. We can have a check-up right here. We can have a check-up right here. No. That will lead to a commotion. It's all right. Nobody will know anything. No. I will leave now. I am not feeling all right. You can't go. The people have come here, just to here you speak. That is why they waited this long. You just have to say a few words. I am sorry. Sir. - To share this happiness with us.. Should I call a doctor? - No. Let's call the doctor. - Didn't I tell you not to? Hello. Yes. We just got here. It is from the Town Hall. - Just put it down somewhere. No. He is resting. No, we didn't see a doctor. We will. Goodbye. They said that the people are making a big fuss over there. - So? Yes. I understand. No, I can't. My decision is final. That is none of my headache! Yes. What is it? What happened? - An earthquake! Could you people just leave me alone? He never came back in to the bedroom that night. He didn't eat anything either. What else happened that night? What else is there to happen? I was crying the entire night. I don't think he slept either. I could hear him all through the night. Do you think he became upset after seeing someone in the audience? That must be it. That must be it. 'Book release.' 'I am still not sure.' 'Was that really her?' 'Oh, God. I hope it really was.' It doesn't seem like he was scared. 'Oh, God. I hope it really was.' Doesn't this mean he saw the person that he wanted to see. Isn't she the same person who went to see him with the first new year gift after 17 years? I don't know. I have only known him for 7 years. I have never tried to know about his past. This is a story Mr. Harikrishnan recently started writing. Only a three-quarter of it is written. He couldn't complete it. He hasn't named it. Have you read it? No. Someone seeing his work without it being finished is something he never liked. Sometimes, when he is in a good mood I have heard him reading it out to the watchman Appu Pillai. He has never shown his manuscript to anyone else. So, are you saying that Appu is the only one who knows what is in this manuscript? Maybe. I am not sure. I noticed it because of a strange joke. I got interested after reading the beginning. But I didn't finish it. I just looked through the pages. Someone dies in the beginning. Someone popular. Someone popular as a novelist and a film director. And at the peak of his career. Really? - Yes. His name is Shambu. I felt like he knew he was going to die when I read the beginning. Oh, God. Doesn't that mean he was afraid that someone might try to kill him? Yes. But who would it be? Anyway, I am lucky about one thing. Even if I wasn't able to see him when he was alive I was one of his biggest fans. I really adored him. I was lucky enough to be the first one to read the unfinished manuscript of his last novel. Since this book is somewhat like his autobiography it might be from this, that I might be able to find a clue. Who knows! This is like a kid studying before his final exam. Is it done? Yes. - Then? I have no clue. That's too bad. That's too bad. How is it going? The investigation is going on pretty good. After going from one guy to another in the end without realising who the suspect is and without any evidence, the case is fading away. So, what about all the leads you got until now? Those leads are good. But the vital lead, the pivotal clue is getting destroyed. So, the case is being closed without any leads. Suppose, he had completed the book. If he did, then we would have got a clue to who the killer was. So why can't we think that there was someone who didn't want this novel to be completed? In that case, someone should have seen this manuscript. That is true. According to his wife the only one who could, is that old watchman. Okay. What she said could also be a lie. What she said could also be a lie. It could be.. Well.. This is becoming more confusing. After reading this, I am afraid of something else. He died after writing about his death in the novel. What if the case also ends up without any leads just like in the novel? What if the same thing happens? Don't worry about that. Don't lose your way. You will get the crucial lead he missed. You will. You are a bright boy. I know. I have heard about this girl. I have seen her once. But that was about 17 years ago. But why would he have kept this photo after all this time? He might have. Hari had all sorts of relationships with many women. He had told me about her. She is the only one that he had felt any attraction towards. He really wanted to marry her. Why didn't that happen? I don't know. He never told me, and neither did I ask him. I thought it would have been one of his personal secrets. Who is she? Before he completely got in to films he was a college lecturer. A very smart English lecturer. She joined there as a tutor in his department. Parvathi. Do you know in which college she works right now? She is not teaching anymore. She is a saint in an Ashram right now. The Ashram of Poornanandha Mission. Based on their terminology, she is a spinster. Would I get any details if I go to this place? You will have to ask the head office. It's somewhere near the Tamil Nadu border. You will find the main Ashram there. Since she is a senior member, she will most likely be there. She is here. But she is not Parvathi any more. But she is not Parvathi any more. Bhaginisevamayi. That is how she should be addressed. Whatever it is, can you call her? I need to know a little about the reason too. It is something that I have to tell her directly. You are a police officer. I saw your identity card. I am convinced too. But even if you are a police officer or a police IG you might not know the regulations of this Ashram. But I don't blame you for it. Please don't think like that. But.. This Ashram has some disciplines of its own. As the head of this place, nothing happens without my knowledge. You should ask me about anything that concerns them. So I should ask you the details about the programs of Bhaginisevamayi, right? Yes. Then Swami, can you tell me that on 18th of last month Then Swami, can you tell me that on 18th of last month that is on January 18th whether Bhaginisevamayi was in this Ashram throughout the day? For that I have to look at the program notes and ledgers. Then search them. Last January 18th she wasn't at the Ashram after noon. When you say after noon did she come back before sunset? No. She came back here the next morning. Where was she? Please pardon me. You should not ask that. She went for a mission that I advised her to go. What mission? - I am sorry. I am not supposed to disclose all those to you. - Swami I have come here regarding a murder case. I got a photo of the Bhagini here, from the diary of the victim. You say she wasn't here at the night of the murder. There is an Ashram near Kottiyam There is an Ashram near Kottiyam near Thiruvananthapuram. I had sent her there. For what? For the coordination of 'Magha Purnima' festival. She had gone there. And she had returned with a message from the Head over there. I will check that later. For now, call that woman. I have to question her. Sir. - Please call the lady. Sit down. You may go, Swami. I have come here regarding a murder case.. I have come here regarding a murder case.. Miss Parvathi.. - Excuse me. It will be best if you do not call me by that name. You can address me as Bhagini or Swamini. If you have a problem with that too then you can call me Sister. Anything else is prohibited here. I just.. One Mr. Harikrishnan a famous writer and film maker.. - I got to know about it. In his personal drawer out of thousands of photographs I found your photo in his personal diary, Sister. That is why I am here. Do you two.. - We knew each other. Could you explain? We worked together for sometime in a college. Apart from that, did you two.. - I told you, we knew each other. That is not what I meant. I don't know if I should say this while inside an Ashram. But there are things I definitely need to know. That is why I am asking you. I got to know about your close relationship with him. It was a different experience of some special days which had happened seventeen years back. Why do you want to know about it now? It's essential. Most of the details you got to know are true. Is that the reason behind you adopting this kind of life? It could be one of the reasons. Have you both met after that? - No. Has Harikrishnan ever visited this Ashram? - No. Have you ever tried to meet him? - No. So you never met him? - No. Until his death? - No. After his death? No. Are you sure that you went to the Kottiyam Ashram on January 18th? - Yes. So you spent the night there itself? - Yes. You can check the register there. Thank you. I'll check it. Sorry for the disturbance. Sorry for the disturbance. He's not as innocent as you think. He stalks all the good-looking girls. - Is it? That means I'm good-looking. Look! I'm warning you. He smokes, drinks and has now started injecting heroin too. Whatever you tell, he's a smart fellow. I like him. He's decent in front of me. Okay then. Carry on. You will soon fall in to his trap. If he's so smart then his trap would also be comfortable. I will prefer that. - What? Then what about me? Make your net better and stronger to trap me. Haven't you studied about survival of the fittest? No. It would be better if you teach me. I don't even know.. - Hey! Get inside the jeep. You son of a bitch, are you troubling girls in public? Come on! Get inside the jeep! - Sir! She's my wife, sir. Is it? - No, sir. - Then? Is it? - No, sir. - Then? He's been stalking me for some time now, sir. - What? Hey.. Two days back I saw you flirting with a girl at this same spot. Look! Don't try to worsen the situation. I've been trying.. - I am leaving. - Okay. I think he has fallen into a trap in the course of his investigation. - Why? The investigation has been moving from one girl to another and has finally stopped at a beautiful one. He has fallen for her. He was praising her beauty the whole night yesterday. During an investigation, when the culprit is found the investigation officer and culprit falls in love. I'll pester him when I get to meet him. No! Don't do that. We speak freely with each other. But if he comes to know that I've been telling you everything he might not like it. - Oh! Suppose, imagine yourself in your brother's shoes. You're a police officer. Imagine you've got a similar case. You'll finally find out that I'm the culprit. You'll finally find out that I'm the culprit. Then what will you do? - What I will do? Get lost! Don't talk to me. You were right that you were in Kottiyam Ashram on January 18th. The register indicates that you spent the night there. But you reached there at around 9 p.m. 'Arrival time, 8:40 p.m.' You left this place at around 2 p.m. If you had left at 2 p.m. then you would've reached there at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. at the most. If you try to make an excuse about any accident then I'll have to approach the transport office and verify it. If you don't want to trouble me.. We've taken a pledge to not lie. That's one of the main rules to be followed by us. There was no traffic problem on the way. If that is true then you'll have to tell where you were between 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. that day. You'll have to explain that absence. According to the post-mortem report Harikrishnan was murdered between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. You have to explain your activities in those crucial hours between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that night. That's my personal affair. I can't disclose it. Okay. This letter was written by you, wasn't it? Isn't it? - No. But don't you know the handwriting? Don't you know who wrote this? I know. Who wrote it? I won't tell you that. These sandals are yours, right? - No. We don't use such slippers But haven't you seen these before? Try to recollect. Where have you seen these slippers? Between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that night do you remember seeing anyone wearing these slippers by any chance? Have you? You're a Sister who has taken a vow not to lie. Don't you remember the person who was wearing these slippers? Yes. - Who was it? I'm sorry. I can't tell you. I don't intend to drag a person like you in to this investigation. I personally don't prefer it. We've got these slippers and a handkerchief from the crime spot. I've got the handkerchief too. - Please! You don't have to show it. The owner of these things is the murderer. And you know the person. But you're trying to hide it. You're not even making it clear about your whereabouts during those decisive three hours. As an investigating officer I want an answer to it. I'll make you say that. You can't pressurize me to open up. Just think before you tell that. Because if I don't get an answer to my question you'll be the first person to be taken into custody for this case. To take a religious Sister under custody connected to the murder of a film director might be a feast to the media but not for me. Because I don't believe that you're behind all this. Because I don't believe that you're behind all this. You cannot do it. But you know the murderer. I'm sure about it. - But I don't know. When the world comes to know about it it'll be a disgrace to you and to your Ashram. You don't have to bother about it. Then you're arrested from this very moment. You're in our custody. Mom.. Look at this! Mom.. Look at this! Sister has been arrested! So sad. How did this happen? How did she get involved in this? Please call up and ask Anil's brother, Mom. He arrested her. Someone is playing behind this. It might be the manipulations of some other religious group to defame the mission!. - Can you call up and tell that we know the Sister, Mom. Then we'll have to suffer as a result. With regard to this case, police have already experienced a lot of problems. Why should we simply get into trouble? The members of the Ashram would've got her released by now. I'll enquire about it. Please, Mom! Call up and ask Anil's brother. I've to attend to the kids in my tuition class. Listen! I'm leaving. You get ready for college. Hello. - Hello. Yes? I'm Shilpa here. - Oh! I was wondering who it was. Anil has already left for college. Will you be available now? - Me? Why? I was about to leave. You can tell me. Can you wait for ten minutes? I want to speak to you. Will it be inconvenient for you? I will come soon. Okay. Make it fast. Yes. Have you been to the Ashram? - No. Then how do you know her? Sister is my mom's friend. What do you mean? Sister is my mom's one and only friend. I know her very well. It's cruel to even doubt her in this case. She's that innocent. But all the evidences are against her, dear. The things we retrieved from the crime scene The things we retrieved from the crime scene she knows whom it belongs to. But she's not disclosing the person's identity. But she has no relation with him. They don't even know each other. How do you know? - I'm sure. Harikrishnan had too many illicit relationships with many women. Pretty women were his weakness. That's nonsense! Have you seen anything? I'm not sure. - Nobody has seen anything. But they make up stories. They're just passing on rumours. All of you. You, my mother and my friends. He was nothing like they say. He was so great and gentle. Did you know him too? - Yes. How? - Since a long time. How long? I was his fan, long before I had met him in person. I know about all his works. Ever since my mom got a transfer as a professor to this city as a professor to this city it's been my dream to meet him. Move.. Move.. Yes, move. 'Peythozhiyaathe.' Start camera. - Running. - Action! The branches may touch.. - The branches may touch.. Since they emerge from the same branch ..can dodge it. - We can dodge it. - Cut! Explain the dialogue to her, James! - Yes, sir. Trolley back! - Understand the meaning first. Should the branch run away? - Sorry, sir. We can't dodge.. We can't dodge.. Cut it! Camera! - Take! Ready? - Ready, sir. Start camera. Running.- Action! - The branches may touch. Running.- Action! - The branches may touch. Since they emerge from the same branch they have no other option. - Dodge.. - They can't dodge it. I admit that I was wrong. I'm ready to accept it as well. I wasn't pointing out a mistake. All I said is that dad over reacted to it. Uncle has his own point of view. He never liked me. Everything is a joke for you. - Cut. Okay. Lights off. - Okay. Change the track for the trolley. - Sir. Go ahead. - I can't. Excuse me, sir. Autograph, please. What's your name? - Shilpa. 'To Shilpa.' Thank you, sir. - What more do you want? Please don't feel that we are disturbing you. If you don't mind, can you attend our college function? I knew it. Sorry. Film stars are available. My assistant can help you out. We don't want them. We want you to come. We are here to invite you. I'm the Secretary of the arts club. - I see. Please, sir. We all wish for your presence. I'm not interested in delivering speeches. Don't you see how busy I am? - Then don't give a speech. Will my presence be enough? Yes, sir. You'll only have to stay for the prize distribution. Yes, sir. You'll only have to stay for the prize distribution. That we will arrange. When is it? - On the 14th. I'm shooting on the 14th. - It's only a matter of 15 minutes. You can leave as soon as it's over. - You'll promise me now. God promise. It won't last for more than 15 minutes. We understand how valuable your time is. It shouldn't take long. - It won't, sir. The next item in the program of this evening is prize distribution. I request our honourable guest, Mr. Harikrishnan the renowned writer and film director to give away the prizes. Sports items. 100 meters dash. 1st prize, Mohana. N. Second prize, Gracy.

Overall championship. Shilpa Iyer. Congratulations. Thank you very much, sir. You're a smart girl. - Sir, wait for a minute. I shall drive the car inside. - Okay. See you, sir. Where's your native, Shilpa? - I'm from the North. However, we have a place in the city. What about your father? - I don't have one. He's no more. He died many years ago. Is your mother employed? Yes. She is a professor. Does she work here? - No. At the Government college. Is she here today. - No. She hardly likes my interests. So, what about your achievements? Aren't they yours? Forget what mom has to say. Talented ones like you are rare. You're gifted. Develop your skills since you're quite gifted. - I am trying. I'm trying my level best. - You must. Shilpa has a trophy collection of her own. Let's leave before it gets any more crowded. Would you mind if I try to contact you once in a while? I've never been so inspired by anyone before. I have nobody to mentor me. Why not? Please do. - Thank you. Do you have my contact number? - Yes. Two of them. Shooting will last till the 21st of next month. You can contact me once it's over. Fancy dress, elocution. And this is for mimicry. And this is for mimicry. This is for short story. Tennis. - Oh. How many are there? - Many. Overall championship. Do you know who distributed the prizes? It was Harikrishnan. The movie director? - Yes, the famous. The best man to be invited to a women's college. What's wrong in it? It was an unanimous decision among us all. We had struggled a lot to get him just for half an hour. So, we can't just blame him. You girls must be blamed for it. I've heard a lot about him. Why do you judge someone just because of what people say? He was really decent. We all loved him. He was great, handsome and elegant. He liked me a lot. He enquired a lot, too. And? - I told him everything. About you, too. What did you tell him? - Look at you. What did you tell him? - Look at you. You fear as if he might call you right now. Why do you have to tell others about us? Don't you know how to behave with strangers? Mom, I'm the Secretary of the art's club. So? Mom, you speak as if I did something wrong. It was my dream to see him in person. And it happened today. Also, I'm allowed to contact him once the shooting is over. I'm warning you. What has happened has happened. Don't bother contacting him. Stupid girls like you might find him interesting. He's a movie director after all. Generally they aren't the best people. Especially him. Your approach might have been innocent. However, his intentions can be different. I'm capable of figuring it out and stopping his friendship the moment I feel odd about it. You better obey my words. Don't try to get in to trouble. You better obey my words. Don't try to get in to trouble. Don't you dare try to contact him. Why not? I will. Then you can forget about your extra-curricular activities. All you have to do is ask him if you need a chance in movies. And, he'd for sure respond to girls like you. I'll ask him. However, he has his ways of doing it. If you do it his way, you won't have to waste time on calls then. I'll do it as per my convenience. Since you have plans to call him he'd for sure invite you over. Yeah, right. Like he's jobless. Waiting for girls to call him. - Wait and watch. He'll definitely invite you over. I'll meet him if I wish to. So what? - I'll eat you up. That's all, right? My bones would be left behind, right? You'll only have to collect my bones and throw them away. You can count on me for that. But you must inform me beforehand. - Of course. Hello. - Hello. I don't know if you remember me, sir. I'm Shilpa. Yes. I remember you. The one who won the prize. So.. Nothing. I thought of calling you.. Thank you. - Oh, no. It's me who should thank you. Then you may. All my friends are jealous of me. When I told them that I'll be talking to you. Yes. They can't believe it. Listen. Don't call me 'sir'. It's boring. Even I feel so. I was thinking of addressing you as 'sir' 2-3 times before shifting to calling you 'uncle'. Oh, no. That is way too boring. We became close in a very short span of time. He started to like me very quickly. I felt that he was someone whom I could talk to like a friend. He called me a few times. I felt that I meant something to him. I had known all his programs by heart. We met a few times outside. He enquired about my studies. He scolded me when he felt that I was not attentive in class. In this manner, I lost all my inhibitions about him. In this manner, I lost all my inhibitions about him. I swear on God, he never misbehaved with me. People started noticing me in all the events he participated. Every time we met, I felt that he cared about me more. But no one understood us. Not even my close friends. I didn't bother correcting them as well. I was sure my mom would scold me. So I hid everything from her. Where are you going? For a function at the town hall, Mom. A literary one. All my friends are coming. I knew it when I read the city program column in today's newspaper. Look how shrewd you are! This is not right, Mom. You're spying on me. It's the release function of a book that guy wrote, isn't it? You need not go. - Why shouldn't I? Don't you raise questions. I told you not to go. Don't you raise questions. I told you not to go. I told I'll attend the event. To whom? You told whom? - My friends. Did you tell him that you'll attend the event? Did you? - Yes. Oh. So you are still in contact with him. Do you want to destroy your life? I haven't done anything wrong. And I won't. You're talking too much. I'll go there no matter what, Mom. Then wait for a moment. I'll come with you. I have something to tell him. He'll reform only if he gets a scolding in public. - Come. You'll understand his character only if you meet him in person. 'The art of this century. The media of this century.' 'We've seen movies being praised like this.' 'Due to several reasons, I can't consider movies' 'to be a form of art. And I don't watch movies.' 'to be a form of art. And I don't watch movies.' 'Normally, when an author enters the film industry, we may' 'say that we've lost an artist.' 'There are several examples.' 'This form of media, because of its popularity, other perks' 'and money has pulled several noted authors' into itself, phenomenally.' 'Irrespective of several justifications..' There are quite a few fools like you to witness their show off. I felt that my mom was responsible for spoiling that event. He told me it's not that, it was because of a headache. Still I had called and apologised to him. I was adamant, to everyone. He was unavailable, when I called him after that. He might have thought of not getting in to a mess. However, I felt like it was an attempt to drift apart. It hurt me a lot. The New Year was approaching. I was really happy, when I found his card amidst my friends Christmas and New Year cards. He addressed me as 'dear' in that card and also signed it. I'll keep that with me till my death. I had called him and informed him when I got it that on New Year eve, on January 1st I'll be the first one gifting him. Haven't you gone to that cottage before? - No. I did know the place. But neither did he call me, nor did I go there. When I told him I'll be visiting him, he objected. When I forced him, he agreed finally. I convinced him. 'Today is January 1st.' 'My dilapidated house has seen many people come and go.' 'She is coming today.' 'I knew she would come to me in the end.' 'I knew she would come to me in the end.' Yes. Come.. So, prepare a feast for lunch. - Fine. We need sweets.. - Oh, no. It's not needed. I'll leave in a while. If my mom comes to know, I'll be in trouble. I told her that I had to prepare notes and a series of other lies. Where is my gift? I got it from the temple after prayers. For a year filled with joy, satisfaction and peace. Then, for a creative and healthy life filled with happiness and prosperity. How did your dad die? I lied to you. My dad is not dead. What? I'm a child born because of my mom's carelessness. My mom loses her temper when I enquire about him. And I'm not interested in knowing about that man who cheated us. Haven't you ever met him? - No. They both got separated, by the time I was born. My mother took me to Nigeria as a baby after securing a job there. She told that she found it difficult to stay here with me in front of her relatives. My mother returned when I turned eight. Even to my very close friends I've told them that my father is no more. It's a deal between me and my mother that we will say the same to everyone. This is for the first time I am saying.. When will you come back? Today is the 1st of January. I'll come back after 17 days. What is so special about that day? - You tell me. It's my birthday. Is your birthday on the 18th of January? - Yes. Then, you should surely visit me. I'll present you something special on that day. A beautiful presentation. A beautiful presentation. No. It would be difficult for me to hide it from my mother. That is your responsibility. I'll surely gift you something. You can ask me whatever you want. I am ready to gift you anything. That is my privilege, not yours. What if I ask for an elephant? - I'll buy you one. The one with a big tusk. Should I arrange one? - No. Then, we will have to take the trouble of arranging food for it. Then, tell me what else do you want? - Should I say? Give me a copy of all your books autographed by you. That is one of my dreams. Agreed. I'll gift it to you. See you. That was the last time I had met him. I couldn't receive my birthday gift either. As my mother did not allow me to go. As my mother did not allow me to go. The same day he got killed. He died on the day of my birthday. I was thinking of sharing this with you from that day itself. Somehow I couldn't find the courage to do it. Today, when I came to know that the Sister got arrested.. They both didn't know each other. I am sure about it. I like that Sister so much. She is a poor soul. You must be Shilpa's mother, right? - Yes. I am Anil's brother, Achuthankutty. Have a seat. You can continue with your studies. Close your door. She visited you in the morning, right? - Yes. She told me about it. You were aware that Harikrishnan was Shilpa's father, isn't it? Yes, I knew. Being her mother I would surely be aware of it. What about this letter? It's written by me. What about this? - It's mine. This? - That also belongs to me. This? - That also belongs to me. We found this from the crime site. We found this letter from his table. - I know. What is the role of Bhaginisevamayi in this murder? I am sure that you are not capable of doing all this by yourself. Parvathi is in no way involved in this. You're simply trying to trouble her. I don't think so. She is not answering to anything in the jail. She is not ready to talk to anyone. - I heard about it. To kill someone and to help someone with the murder and also to hide something involved in it, is all a punishable offence. I know. Why is she not ready to take your name after knowing that all these evidences are against you? She has such a big heart. How did you both get so close to each other? 17 years ago, we both worked closely with each other. Three of us were working together in the same department. Three of us were working together in the same department. Was it before Harikrishnan's entry in to the film industry? - Yes. He was also famous back then. We used to denote him as a star lecturer. He used to be a hero figure in front of the girls. He used to create sensations with his creative works back then. Girls used to go crazy about him. We used to joke about him in the staff room that girls attending his lectures used to go hysteric. You were also very young during those days. - Yes, I was. I used to hate him. - Why? He was a reckless womaniser in those days. Was he like.. - Yes. He used to live alone in a rented house near our college. He gave the excuse that it was for his privacy. It was an open secret that most of the girls who admired him used to visit him in his house regularly. him used to visit him in his house regularly. He never used to stick with one girl. Once during one of our college days two students started fighting for him in the backstage. We both worked in the same department for two years but still we never spoke to each other. Once Parvathi joined our department as a tutor.. She spoiled everything. Actually it was not her. Her beauty and her charm were the root cause for everything. Also, being such a good soul. She was such an idiot. How did you got so close with Parvathi? I knew her from my home town. We both hailed from the same place. Even our families knew each other. Any relation? - No, we were not related by any means. She was the only daughter of a rich father. My father worked as an assistant to a lawyer. My father worked as an assistant to a lawyer. My father had five other kids apart from me. We both shared the same room in the college hostel. Her father had asked me to take care of her. She was staying away from her house for the first time. I was like her local guardian. From day one, I was worried about her. I always felt like she took the initiative of being free and frank with that guy. I had always warned her. Whenever I used to scold her for doing that she used to reply like a kid saying that there was nothing to worry. Although, we lived in the same room I found out later that their relationship had grown beyond my expectation. I came to know that you went to advise her. So she told you. Now, do you feel like giving me an advice? Why are you trying to involve yourself in our matter? I've been given the responsibility of taking care of her by her father. I've some responsibility. We are adults. We know how to take care of ourselves. You are too smart a person and she is such an idiot. Why are you trying to spoil her? She is a poor soul. How am I spoiling her? I will tell that to her parents. I will tell them about it. - You will? I know you for such a long time. You're that kind of person who will stop your bike on seeing a beautiful statue wearing a Sari. Try to say it more naturally. Leela must be a poor soul. She is not aware of the do's and don'ts of this society. I was looking everywhere for you. - Yes. I won't be scared if Appukuttan is with me. I am ready to obey Appukuttan. See you. - Okay. Leela's father is responsible for answering this. They are overdoing it. I've the freedom to decide whom I want to marry. I've informed my family about it. Dear, we are poor people. Come. Let's go to our hostel. It will get late, by the time this gets over. You may leave. I'll come with Mridula. Why are you so interested in this? Your peace of mind is not going to get affected if you don't see this. If you're not interested, you can leave. Why are you disturbing me? Students have already started rumours about both of you. Don't stand here with him and prove them right. I'll take care of myself. Please don't disturb me. I am saying this because I've some responsibilities towards you. If you spoil your name here and get back to your native it might not spoil your future as your dad is a rich man. You will surely find someone to marry. Even I belong to the same place. Even I belong to the same place. I am against this because this would reflect me too. What is your problem? - I don't have one. Then, why are you disturbing me at my work place? I am very well aware of your work. These are all your tricks to be surrounded by girls. You used to do this always in the name of college day and festivals. I know the culmination of this too. Everyone is aware of it. Shut up! - You shut up. You may try shouting at these girls, not me. They might be crazy about you. They might adore you. They even might be hysteric about you. I am not like that. I hate you. I feel contempt. Even your presence stings me. Understand that. Stop it! This is not the place for you to show off your complex. What kind of complex? I don't have any kind of complex. In every way, you are inferior to me. You're a dirty heap of all the primitive complexes. No men would ever fall for you. No men would ever fall for you. You are not receiving the reception that other beautiful girls receive. You're talking like this because of that complex. When the best phase of your life goes like this, then everyone will feel such kind of jealousy and anger. But you are not supposed to take it all out on me. If you're that desperate, then go and stand on the roadside. The lorry drivers passing by would be happy to have you. Get lost from here. 'If you're that desperate, then go and stand on the roadside.' 'The lorry drivers passing by would be happy to have you.' 'Get lost from here.' Yes, come in. Are you here to play the role of a local guardian or to apologise for yesterday's performance? Why the hell should I apologise to you? For that you should have a good pedigree. In other words, you should be born to decent parents. Only then, you would have a good character. People coming from a filthy background would have filthiness in their blood. would have filthiness in their blood. If you behave well with me, then so will I. If you behave badly then, I'd go even lower than your standards. You have only met girls who would rush to share the bed with you. Now, you better learn how to behave with girls. It won't be right, if you leave so easily. Since you've acted too smart you better see my bedroom before leaving. I really have no interest in you. I don't even feel anything seeing your body. I know that you're a third rate nasty frigid bitch. I cannot stand holding my head held high in front of you if you leave so easily after slapping me. And I won't be able to look at another girl as a man. That's why. Leave! After that day, everything got messed up. Parvathi left the hostel and went back home without even listening to my explanation. Anyhow, there was nothing left for me to explain. We avoided each other whenever we met inside the college. I avoided him and he avoided me. After two weeks We heard the news that Parvathi had joined some Ashram. It destroyed me completely. It got worse, when I came to know about Harikrishnan's reaction to that news. He resigned his job. Is it only because Parvathi joined the Ashram? - Yes. From that day on, he never came back to college. He directly fell into the world of cinema. It was something more like self-torture. Or like an escape. You might have been relieved when he left the college, right? Yes, it was. Yes, it was. But after some days I understood that he left his curse upon me. Did you try to contact him? - No. I couldn't even imagine facing him again. I hated him so much. My father was a poor soul. So was my mother. Sin and divinity, chastity self-respect, motherhood, marriage they had raised me with all these. I couldn't even imagine of aborting this child and leading a happy life with someone else. I preferred to stay as a single parent for my child. Nobody was aware of this till the time the college closed for vacation. the college closed for vacation. By the time it reopened, I took a transfer to Madapalli. I forged a story about my husband. After giving birth to Shilpa I went to Nigeria with a teaching assignment to escape from everyone. It was like a long leave. Then, when did you return? When she turned eight. Did you return thinking that everyone would have forgotten about it? - Yes. The first thing I did after returning was meet Parvathi at the Ashram. To ask for her forgiveness. But it wasn't required as she was at a stage where she was ready to forgive anyone for all their sins. She started hugging Shilpa after knowing that she was Harikrishnan's daughter. I felt like she still loved him like she had before. Shilpa was the real reason for her to forgive me. Shilpa was the real reason for her to forgive me. Since that day, Parvathi was the only one who used to arrive every year on the day of Shilpa's birthday. Did you meet Harikrishnan later in that function at the town hall? - Yes. I used to see him constantly in papers and posters and television screens. But that day, I'd met him in person. It was a deep shock for me when I came to know that Shilpa was trying to get close to him in spite of my warning. I was worried whether they would involve themselves in an unwanted relationship. Harikrishnan was aware that Shilpa is his daughter. Being her father he could have had his intuitions. - Yes. He was aware of it but it got too late, by the time I was aware of it. but it got too late, by the time I was aware of it. Thank you. Please come. You've received so many gifts. My friends were here in the morning. It was such a mess here. Everyone were here by dawn itself and they just left after lunch. Why did you not come to have lunch with us? I couldn't come earlier. Even this, I was able to make it after connecting with another program. Before evening, I've to reach Kottiyam. No, I won't leave you today. Where are you going at this time? - I'll be back soon. It will be evening by the time you return. No. I'll be back within half an hour. Where are you heading so urgently? - To Laly's house. Where are you heading so urgently? - To Laly's house. Laly was here till afternoon. Yes, but I had told her that I would visit her in the evening. She would be waiting for me. Let her wait. But you won't go anywhere today. I know you are going to meet him. Yes. Why is it so important to meet him? I had told him that I'll meet him today. He must be waiting there with my birthday gift. You shouldn't accept that gift. - Yes, I will. He is waiting there for me after cancelling all his programs. I'll be right back after accepting his gift. You can also accompany me if you want. I cannot cancel it. I've promised him. Shilpa. Stay there. Stop. Leave me. I will go. - You! Dear. - Mom. Dear. - Mom. Leave me, Mom. - Come here. You won't go. - I have to go. Come here. - I need to go. Please, Mom. Please ask her to leave me. You won't go anywhere. Mom.. Please open the door. Mom. Please open the door. Mom! I am scared that something unwanted might have happened. Nothing must have happened like that. She had visited his place once. She is too adamant. She is too adamant. The guy who had spoiled my life, if he spoils my daughter's life.. Why don't you tell her everything? - No. It would destroy her life. Now, she doesn't have a father to point at. Her father had left her ever since her birth. Now, she has got adjusted to it. Let it be like that. If she gets to know the truth the people around her, will have no respect for her. People might even start looking at her in the wrong way. That will hurt her. That will destroy her future. I might have told her everything if he wasn't married to anyone. But now after going through all this for all these years, only for her.. for all these years, only for her.. Please open the door. Let me attend the phone. Please, Mom. Hello.. Hello. No. I won't be late. If she feels hungry, give her some food. She won't be ready to eat anything, but if you say, she won't deny. I had told the principal that I would reach there by 5:30 p.m. Now because of this confusion here, I've to listen to her complaints. Will you be back at least before 7:30 p.m.? I need to leave by then. I'll be back soon. It would take me only 45 minutes. Don't shout. Shilpa should never know about this. 'To my daughter. From the father whom you hate.' Father. 'To my daughter. From the father whom you hate.' Immediately, I had sent Parvathi to the Ashram. Immediately, I had sent Parvathi to the Ashram. If she had stayed for the night it would've been hard for her. Without her knowledge I had burned away all his books. When I realised that he had called her over to present her with a gift and to reveal that he was her father yet again, I had failed in front of him. The following morning when she had cried over the news I found it hard to console her. That was when I felt bad for her. Such an unfortunate child. Why did you take the knife? - I don't know why. I can't imagine what mental state I was in back then. You can say that I intended to kill him. You can say that I intended to kill him. I went to his place with the motive to kill him by holding all that hatred in my mind. However before my arrival someone had already killed him. Suppose you were there first one to get there. And you happen to see the gift. What could've happened? I mean, do you feel that it could have ended up as a family reunion? If it was that simple, it would have been better. Is there any meaning to your question? Shilpa.. You could've told this to me earlier. Shilpa. Mom.. - Shilpa. I'm not able to completely believe her statements. I'm not able to completely believe her statements. There's a loophole somewhere. Her claims are based on a single loophole. I have my own doubts. Just like that loophole and how Hari's novel ended unresolved what if this case remains unresolved as well? - That won't happen. I won't give up on this case. Those three women are involved in this case. Which three women are you saying? Bhaginisevamayi. Your friend's mother. And your friend, Shilpa. The mother and her daughter must be taken into custody. They would only speak the truth at the station. But, Shilpa. I need to question her once again. She may reveal what her mother is trying to hide. She's a deep woman. She's a deep woman. In spite of having all the evidences against her she is still trying to get away. She won't change her claims. Her daughter is just a child. She will speak the truth once we interrogate her. Don't arrest Shilpa. How about we question her here? - That won't be enough. Some would only speak the truth inside a police station. It's pathetic to trouble her. Though she smiles, she cries inside. Nobody knows her, like I do. You're speaking out of your sentiments for her. I need to do my job. In this stage, when they heard Bhaginisevamayi is in custody due the fear of spilling the truth they're fooling me with their made up stories. That can't happen. - Please. Please don't do this to her. If you take her in to custody, her life would be over. She hasn't done anything wrong. She hasn't done anything wrong. Let me tell you something. Mind your own business. This is none of your business. Please don't. Hello, is this the police station? Anil. You don't have to arrest her. I am the reason behind his death. Is Shilpa home? Could you call her mom? She knows me. Shilpa? - She's not home. She's not home yet? She had told me that she would be going out. But she said that she'd be back before 5 p.m. Didn't I tell you that she's not home? Will she be back soon? - I don't know. Aren't you more aware of her activities than me? She was supposed to be back by now. I shall wait until then. - No. I have guests today. Why would my presence matter? - I don't like it. This is her birthday gift. Will you please give it to her on my behalf? Probably the movie maker's gift would be costlier. Though your daughter gets back late after meeting him I've realised that it's none of your concern. Publicity is your problem. What do you mean? Shilpa had informed me that she'll be at his place. I had warned her. How would she not go? She would've been forced by her mom. Aren't you ashamed of sending your daughter to a stranger's place? It wouldn't matter to you if she returns home with money. Don't shout. Get out. Get out! Of course you can make money. She's young, isn't she? I asked you to get out. Take a seat. Do I know you? What do you want? Either speak or leave without being a disturbance. I understand that my presence is a disturbance to you. However, that is my intention. I don't even know you. Then why would you want to disturb me? No. But I know you. I know everything about you. The things that money and fame makes you do. Get up. Get up! Get out! Speak up if you have anything to say. I'll throw you out if you are high on medication and you think you can act smart in front of me. I have nothing to gain by acting smart in front of you. No, right? - No! I'm here to speak to the girl who is in your room right now. I have something to ask her. Only then will I leave. The girl in my room? There's nothing like that. - I'll decide that. Don't you dare enter my room. - I will. No. This is my place and my house. No one is allowed in here without my permission. I will. Or else, why don't you bring her out? I'll take care of the rest. Don't you have any shame? She's your daughter's age.. Get lost! Get lost! Stop! Shilpa.. Open the door. Shilpa! Before I confessed this Before I confessed this the relationship we had was that of a murderer and an investigator. Though we had shared the same house, I feared you. Now it feels like I've got you back. Like my fears have vanished. Now, I have nothing to fear. Nothing at all. I'm at peace now. My brother must not fail. Shilpa must not suffer because of me. Anil! Anil! 'I am the one who murdered Harikrishnan, the film director.' 'I am solely responsible for his death.' 'I am giving up my life' 'to avoid the burden that may fall upon the ones I love.' 'to avoid the burden that may fall upon the ones I love.' 'After reading this, I am afraid of something else.' 'He died after writing about his death in the novel.' 'What if the case also ends up without any leads' 'just like in the novel?'
