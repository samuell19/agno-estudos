There are two ingredients to time. One is the notion of time as a logical space. The other is the notion of it being a logical space used by us to represent relations between events and conceptional connections between concepts. But this just does not reflect the content of our concept of time. Arguably, an object is a teacup... Only if it has been produced by a conscience agent with some general intention about its use or possible use. And... consequently... In a world devoid of conscious intending agents while there might be things like teacups... There would be no... Teacups! Dummy: However... This just does not seem to apply in the case of time. Our conception of time is not su... Not such that we would say of a possible world devoid of conscious agents that while there is something like time there is literally no time... On the grounds that no one was doing any representing in that world. One might wish to hold that a full grasp of our concept of time involves grasping the possibility of using certain mathematical structures in representing the temporal aspect of things.
