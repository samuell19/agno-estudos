Poor thing. He must feel like heaven! You're grinning like a dirty man. Why don't you get married? I don't think so. I don't want to. I'll go out for a while. - Same place? - Eh? Yes, yeah. Bar Farce You're late tonight. Yes. Sorry, don't cry. I'm not crying because of you. I suddenly felt sad for myself. Working in the office every day and get married one day, and that's my life? Poor me... Don't you think it's pathetic? Hey! You'll catch a cold. Dear... You're dreaming. Seems like you're in a good mood, Dad. Kazuo... Can I have some water, please? That bar again? Yeah. I've been there. Have you? No resemblance. No? She's nothing like Mom. Not at all? I see. Nothing like her, huh? Hey, Dad. Don't drink too much. Watch out for your health. I'll be damned if you died. Where's that coming from? Forget it, go to bed. Just go to bed. Suit yourself. What a fine day. Why don't you go for a walk? Yeah. Does Koichi treat you well? Yes, he does. What a resemblance. You look very much like his mother. Who, me? Do I look like her? Who? Me. Look like who? Your mother. Who said so? Who do you think? Dad? Yes. He says that to every woman. Don't trust a single word of my father. Okay. I'm hungry. Would you like some porridge? Dear, what happened to you? Take off your shirt. Poor thing. No... No... I'm going! Akiko! A rare sight. You've just missed your father. Have I? What a resemblance! She looks exactly like Aunt. Really? I'm not sure. And he is? I'm her cousin. And they are... my friends from my hometown. They came for my brother's wedding, and are sightseeing now. I see. I thought he's your boyfriend. How's your sister-in-law? They are good together. She's a beautiful lady. She's nice too. Dad said she reminds him of Mom. It's boring being a woman, you know? Marriage ends everything. You'll be confined to your house, waiting for old age. I wanna live more freely. Make a lot of money, and have a lot of fun! Right, Madam? No! Please! Go away! Leave me alone! Listen to me! I'm just worried about you! That's enough! What's Kazuo doing now? He stays in his room all day. Anything to eat? I'm hungry. What's he like? He's shy, that's all. I'll make some porridge for you. Sex Sauna Welcome. My name is Laura Baugh. I'm so lucky that my first customer is my brother. Are you a regular? Wanna do it or not? I don't mind either way. Whichever you like. What happened to your work? I quit. I see. What a surprise. Your brother left just like that? Yeah, my boss wasn't happy about it. I didn't dare tell him he was my brother. Aren't you in trouble? Why? I mean, at home? Sure. But nothing I can do. - Do you live at home? - Yeah. Wow. Aren't you worried? - Why? - I can't imagine what they'd say. Who knows what each of us doing outside home. What did you do? An office worker. When I was a student, I wanted to be a news reporter or a copywriter. But that's one in thousands chance, right? I am just an ordinary person. So I listened to my parents' advice and worked in the office, hoping to find a husband. You may fall in love or you may think "he'll do" and get married. End of story. What a waste of life, pathetic. You happy now? That's harsh, but hey... No big deal. I couldn't care less. Whatever. I don't care. You sure? Yes. Harder. Is this what you want, you swine? How're things? What? Calmed down? Yeah. Shukichi! Kazuo! Akiko seems to be in love. She's all brightened up recently. You think so? Really? Yes! She looks amazing. Does she? Are you in love? Why? You've been home late, your skin looks radiant, you look amazing. Really? Do I look amazing? For sure. You look very much like your mom. You're kidding. I'm not kidding. It's my fault. I made a mistake. You kept saying she looks like Mom, so I went to see her. To the bar with Koichi. Since then, he's been seeing her regularly. There's something going on between them. You think so? I know so. Now you can see the Shin-Ohashi bridge. This used to be the oldest bridge on the Sumida River, but the bridge was replaced in I 976 and re-named as New Bridge. What a wonderful Sunday! That's good. He should be here with you, my damn son. Have you called his office? It's not necessary. I trust him. How many days has it been? One week. Really? In the Edo era, you could see many fireflies around here, and there was a stylish pier for the red-light goers. Hey, you! Sex Sauna - A Complete Guide It was a new experience. I'm sorry for the trouble. Don't make me go there again. Why did you steal? I was in a funny mood so I tried to shake it off. Let's shake it off. Promise me you will never steal again. Yuriko. Just this once. My last night at home. Yeah. Yuriko will take care of you. Yeah. I wish I could stay here forever. Akiko looked ever so happy. Really? Yes, of course. I never knew that he owns a sex sauna. All Akiko said was he's her boss. He looked older than me. You look younger than your age. He's losing his hair. Can I ask you a favor, Dad? What is it? I wanna move out. I'd like to try it out. I see. That's not a bad idea. Why don't you come back? Yuriko is waiting for you. Where is Kazuo? He went back to his apartment. Yuriko. Yes? You know, you can go back to your family. I don't think Koichi is coming back. I won't be able to leave you behind. It's very nice of you but... your father must be feeling lonely as well. Maybe. Let me tell you what my father told me. "Marriage will not give you instant happiness." "It's wrong to assume that marriage will bring nothing but happiness." "Don't wait for happiness to come to you," "you must create your own happiness." "Marriage doesn't mean happiness." "A couple must learn" "how to find happiness in their lives together." "It is only then that they will become a real couple." "I can tell that your mother wasn't happy at first." "We've been through many things." "I had seen her hiding in the kitchen sometimes, crying." "Though your mother was very patient." "Learn to trust each other." "Learn to love each other." "Treat Koichi the same way you've been treating me," "with great gentleness." "Okay?" "Then you will find your own happiness with him." "I hope you understand." Yuriko. Shukichi. I'll wait. I'll wait for Koichi to come back, with you. So please, let me stay here with you. My dear... she's a perfect daughter-in-law. Koichi is not worthy of her. What a wonderful daughter-in-law.
