See, I am changing the number plate. --Why? Just like that, I am thinking smart! Same just like your mother. Cauvery Bar and Restaurant, Coorg, Madikeri. Purandar, the person you asked for is right here. I will give it to him. Take this, speak! Who is it? -- It?s ACP man. Tell me sir. What?s happening Sub Inspector GovindRaj? In Bengaluru they are conducting rituals for your demise. And in the Coorg town you are drinking there happily! When you said Inspector GovindRaj, I remembered. After the case, none in your department called to inquire If I am breathing or not, sir! Please get me my Rs.10, 000 Sir! In Inspector GovindRaj?s name, to stage this dram, who was it who gave you this deal? Please don?t play the fool, sir! Is it not your department who called me? I kept the gun on the dashboard, the gun fell down. and the boy picked it up! I shot from another gun, sir! The boy got scared and ran away! I put blood on my face and fell on the steering, they took photos. Get dressed fast man! They took me in the ambulance and left me half way. Add something to it and give me, sir! This is what they have given.Go man! I asked for money, but they refused, sir! You really don't know? I swear on my daughter, I don't know sir! Atrocious! Who? Sub Inspector GovindRaj (SI) Is the dead man speaking? He is not dead, Ani! SI GovindRaju's death was a drama that was completely staged. The photo that was published in the paper is that of a local rowdy Coffe Appaiah! He is boozing in Coorg town. I just spoke to him. If you trash him and take him to task, he will open his mouth. Impossible, Ani. He is a rowdy sheeter. In the entire deal, he will be ignorant as to where he stands! Has something like this happened in the department before? Quite a few! I feel that if you trace the real SI GovindRaju perhaps you will get a solution to all these problems. In Chitraduga Gopalswamy pond, an unidentified dead body found. Puru, 2 days ago near Chitradurga's Gopalswamy pond.. ..didn't you mention that the guy and the girl were attacked? They have found a dead body near the pond. See, the news has been published in the news paper. The bullet has entered the body next to the neck. As the fish have eaten it away, the face can't be identified properly. There is a mark here! -One second. About SIGovindRaju, I got few deatils about Inspector After that, this SI GovindRaju has reported to work for a mere 10-15 days. Even there, not a single day has he correctly reported for duty. The most interesting news is that recently there was news about the demise of SI GovindRaju in Bengaluru Till then no one knew that such a person exists in the department. It's really strange , Ani! Puru, this Govindaraju's prominent identification marks are There is a swelling mart on his left hand forehand and on his right hand ha has tattooed his mother's name. So it's confirmed, Ani. Who is dead here is the real SI GovindRaju! I want few more details about this GovindRaju! Just check and let me know! -Ok! Department of Forensic medicine. Mr.Swaminath!

A post mortem report has to be faked now! Sir, what are you saying? I am not such a person, sir! Who conducted the post mortem report for SI GovindRaju? Is it not you? Yes, sir! But SI GovindRaju's post mortem is happening at Chitradurga city hospital! Which body did you conduct post mortem report on? That is an inside matter! Let it be within ourselves, sir! Sindhu, I am ACP Purandar speaking! Sir, tell me! The money is melting over. I told you,but you didn't listen to me. Will you keep quiet? Who are you calling? Aye, hi gowri, how are you? Leave all that aside. Listen! Sindhu, I am in need of urgent help. I need some money.I will return you back. You first listen! Some police inspector named Purandar wants you to call him. He was saying that there is something important! Please don't call any friends, got it! Get lost! Are we serving the nation that everyone has to jump and help us! ACP Purandar, we have to call, I believe. Do we really need to? Hello! Kormangala police station. ACP Purandar sir is there? -May I know who is on the line? I am Gowri shetty. I wanted to talk to him. Sir is not in town. Ok sir, tell me sir! 9845.. Give the phone to Ravi! When you have decided to kill us. What difference does it make as to who you are calling to.

I don't believe you, sir! Whatever it is, talk to me! You have to! Give the phone to Ravi! Sorry, sir! I said give the phone to Ravi! Sir! When you shot that day, did you see the bullet being fired? Sir, that day in the panic, I don't know what happened, sir. I heard the sound of an explosion. I opened my eyes and he had fallen on the steering, sir! But that day the gun that was in your hand did not fire the bullet. This is because the person is not dead, he is alive! Do you have the gun right with you? -Yes sir! Open it! Do what I say! -Yes sir! Tell me sir! Open the magzine. -How to open it, sir? There is a button there.press it. It must be on the other side, check ! How many bullets are there? --Six bullets. Exactly! In a fully loaded gun,there should be 6 bullets only! By chance,if one was fired, there should have been five, isn't it?--Yes sir! Then? You have not killed anyone. I am killing you is what you think! No! I will save you! You don't come anywhere!I will come where you are and meet you. Please, you will have to believe me!I will have to save you. Where are you now? Hubballi , sir!

Hello! Can you hear me? I am leaving to Hubballi now. Ravi & Gowri are meeting me at 6 p.m. near chennamma circle. Sir, Gowri & Ravi are meeting our officer at 6.p.m. near hubballi chennamma circle. He had called his wife. Mr.Narayanswamy! See, I have got an information! If I get delayed getting back then meet me near Unakallin kere. On slippery lanes, it looks like it has ended. Glancing back, there lies a border. If I turn and run ahead, there lies a border. The anklets are such that they have knotted the earth. Does it matter as to where we go or where we come. Does it matter as to where we sit or where we stand. Sir, tell me! Why have not you called till now? Sir, we are still searching! You're an idiot, I say! Yes sir! He escaped in a fraction of a second! It is because of dumb asses like you that our department is like this! Oh, it's burning like mad! You, you I will transfer you! Sir! Come here I say! Tell me, sir! How much is this? Rs.30,000, sir! Right.About the Mangaluru drug deal, I have got some information. 8 months ago,an infomation was received from Karwara town about a drug deal case which was running in a big scale. 3 police officers teamed up and raid it. About 100 millions worth of drugs are siezed and.. ..this information was given by them to the government. After this in a few days sub inspector GovindRaju.. ..goes missing suddenly from the team. Then asking for a transfer, he himself begets the tranfer ..without the order of the government. Seeing all this.. the account given to the government.. ..something worth more than that in tune of many millions. ..has been gulped is what I feel. When the officers were sharing the ammount equally, Something has gone amiss, PURU! This SIGovindRaju has not paid up and has gone in to hiding. Later he must have been caught in Chitradurga city. By chance if he is apprehended and opens his mouth ..then all the three will get jacked. So they all have joined and killed him, thats what I feel. Who all were there in the team? Chandrashekar, Narayanswamy and GovindRaj. and.. ..the area incharge was deputy commissioner Suryakanth Ok, Ani, I will call you again later. They are travelling in the high way in the same direction. We were supposed to meet them up in Hubballi. I waited but they didn't turn up! If they have the intention to mislead, they would have gone to the next town. I will go to Belagavi and check! If you get any clue here, inform me. See Chandrashekar, you go straight to Belagavi. Ok, sir! You have to be closely trail, officer Purandar.--ok, sir. You have to finish that boy and the girl before they meet Purandar Okay, sir! See I am warning you.This is your last time.--yes sir. This time too, if you say such a strory that you are unable to catch them, ..then you will not be able to leave Belagavi city. Okay, sir! I will go,change my dress and return. Hello! Mother! Gowri! please talk to me! Where are you,Gowri? Why didn't you contact me all these days? Mother! I am scared of you ma! Why are you scared? I don't know, ma! I feel scared! Ma, do you remember? Once because I came late from school, the whole night you let me be outside the door. I called you many times Mama! Mama! many times but you didn't open the door! When I remember your anger even now, I get scared Ma! Gowri!No! If you want to return come back alone! I really love him a lot ma! Mama! Please ma! Gowri! What happened? Why are you crying? What happened man? My last hope was my Mama! She herself told me not to come home! Don't cry, Gowri, nothing will happen, be calm! Why are you behaving is such a rude way? Is it because you think everything is happening because of me! Be honest and tell me! Are you scared to take my responsibility? Answer me. I am asking you. Be quite Gowri! My head is splitting! This..this is not the answer to my question! You are so selfish! And I believed you and came! When my mama ditched us, I thought you would console me. I don't have anyone man! I feel I have committed a blunder! Don't cry Gowri! Then answer me! Let us stay together. -Lies!! You're not saying this from your heart! Aye, that day you asked me repeatedly to leave, Ravi! I will go now, but I will not go home. I will go somewhere else! I won't die. I will live and how you.--Aiyyo Gowri sorry! Please understand.I didn't mean that!--Leave me!! Ravi! Why you are so dull? Last night did I say something and sudden you? In the early morning, I had a bad dream, Ravi! The police shot you and my mother dragged me! In that chitradurga peak, police who were searching with a torch you know? I coudn't remember properly what was it? People says, the dreams that you have in the morning will come true! We both will die! As far as I remember, we haven't harmed anyone, Ravi! This life is what you have saved man! My breath is a gift that you have given. Why is that everyone wants to kill us!? Gowri, we are almost reaching Belagavi. Just ahead is Mumbai! New city, new life and new people! Don't worry, we can somehow live. We are dying without money! Who is waiting to help us? Hey, shall we sell this bangle? This is your love gift! To hell with the love! If we sell this bangle, we will get a flight ticket to Mumbai! You are really super! Oh! it smells! First change this shirt! You fell in the ditch and hugged me and wept like a baby! It's you who is smelly! We don't want this.Let us go! In between cities, tar was put by whom? Who fixed milestone stand proclaimed that this was a city? Whose guiding finger did we believe and come? We, our own shadow have killed a long ago. When every life's journey only ends in the mud! What if there is life? What if there isn't? What then is the way? What then is the direction? On slippery lanes, it looks like it has ended. Glancing back, there lies a border. If I turn and run ahead, there lies a border. If you have to help us, should we tell you our entire story? Without a clue,wide eyed on the road,while you were.. ..standing as if you have lost something. I realized then that you are love birds. Have you escaped from home? See! all that we have is this bangle and the phone and then.. That's all sir! Nothing else! You have to escape to Mumbai from here!--Yes! Firstly, I get a room for both of you with my money.

Near Gopalswamy pond some 2 policemen you called them and without even talking to you.. they shot you. All this you have written. Yes, sir! Can you identify who they are? We mailed Purandar, sir! He may have been one of them The other, I didn't know. Saying may have been.. ..in doubt here is not possible! This is a matter of life or death! We were near the temple! They were far away at the pond! I couldn't identify them. Right! Put a signature on this paper with today's date. Tell me, sir! See, that girl has given a signed statement!

Ravi is a poor boy! For having saved her daughter, her mother might have thanked you, isn't it? The police behave in a way that makes the public scold them, PURU! What you did is not right! Why are you smiling? Is it because you think you have achieved something great? All this is happened because of you! Because of me?--yes! How is that? Is it not you, who told me about the Mangaluru drug deal? In Belagawi, when I saw Naryanswamy & Chandrashekar, I weighted everything once! On thing I got confirmed. Both Gowri and Ravindra will die! I don't know whose good fortune it was! Gowri called me. I was able to detect the hotel they were staying in. It was me who barged in first! Sir! Why are you looking at my face? Did you know who gave this deal? Gowri's mother! If the police had not got the deal, some rowdies would have killed you! Do you have any idea as to what kind of cases is piled up in your name? Drug, murder, kidnapping! None of these are connected to you! You are being falsely linked to all these. Even now if you go out, you will be dead! Sir, she is my life! I really love her.

Did it slip from my hands, this story of mine! If not today, later to join you.This longing will keep me alive! When I get you, all this I will narrate. I like this alliance if Chetan is going to become my son-in law. This mind is a limitless ocean. At night they are wakeful waves. Hi Gowri! Hello Gowri! Gowri, it's me! Who is it?
