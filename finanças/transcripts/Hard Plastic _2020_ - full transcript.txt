- Nice shot. - That was hot. Foot fall. No, no, that was a perfect shot. Sorry, foot was over the line. Guys are saying, no, listen to the guys. Vote, can we take a vote? Are we playing by the rules or not? Come on. That birdie flew away. Such bullshit. Hey. Shane, my boy, how are you? Have a seat. Please, sit down. Not there, that is a Herman Miller original. Please. I'm gonna have to teach you about these antiques if you're going to be posting them on my internets. Sit in the knock off. - Sorry. - Yes. That's worth about a thousand bucks, this is 60 bucks. You'll learn, my boy, you'll learn, my boy. And you'll get paid, you'll get paid. - Okay. - You'll get paid. You know he's not from England, right? Whoa, ladybug. That is true, I'm not proper British, but most of my friends are Brits, and I've spent quite a few fortnights across the pond, as they say. Interesting. I guess the dialect has rubbed off on me, some of the affectations. So, yes, I am Yankee by blood, but British by. Okay, Dad, this has, this has got to, Shane, do you think that I could just talk to my dad really quick, just privately? Yeah. - Dad? - You know what? Just stop. I get it. I'm acting a little crazy. I feel crazy. I'm having what they call, a mid-life crisis, okay? But I don't have the money to buy a Corvette or a boat or a motorcycle or whatever the fuck 50 year olds buy or do when they turn 50, which is halfway to a hundred. That's mid-life, if I live to be a hundred. You're gonna be lucky if I don't live to be a hundred. This is what I'm doing, okay? This is my mid-life crisis. Let me have a little fun. I'm having fun with Shane. I just wanted to borrow 20 bucks. For what? A disc golf tournament. You know what, there's a saying, when you're a child you play with children's toys, but as you grow up you must put. No, hang on a minute. It goes, children play, when you're a child your toys are okay, but as you grow up you've got to put the toys away. I think it actually rhymes like that. In a trunk or something like that. Basically, what I'm trying to say is grow the fuck up. And please just get a real job. Thank you. Don't walk out on me, bye-bye. God. What did I do to their beautiful rock garden? Hello? Hello. Hello? - Yeah. - Hello? How can I help you? Is Lily here? She's probably asleep, but, you're her friend, yeah, from high school, Nina. Nona. No, it's not Nina? - Nona. - No. - Sure. - Yeah, she's asleep, so why don't you come back in a couple. - Lily! - Lily. She's sleeping. Well, she can wake up. - Sleeping. - Nona. Come in here. Hey, Lily, Lily! Lily! - Nona! - Hey! - Oh my gosh! - Oh my gosh! - Come in. - I'm sorry. Just get in here. Just come on in. I dropped out. I know, I can't believe it. We gotta party. I am home forever. Hang on a minute. Did you say you dropped out of college? Yeah. - Yeah. - Well guess what? Lily never went. Neither did you. Okay, that's neither here nor there. Are you guys hungry? - Yeah. - Can I get you anything? - Yeah. - So I've been writing poems. Hey, real quick. How's your mom? She's crazy. Yeah, crazy like a foxy lady. She's such a bitch and that's what I love. You know, men love bitches and that's why you're gonna get a lot of men little lady. - So, I got this. - Boom. You're still scratching? Yeah, but this is a winner. This is a winner. How much did you win? 10 dollars right here. A boat. Let's bring people. Okay. We get some guy models to serve us, and cook for us. Or robot models. - Yeah. - Okay. - Got ya some breakfast. - Yes, yummy! I have a lot to do today, so have at it. I'm so glad to be home. I'll be at the shop. It was sad and lonely. I hated it. It's great. It's great to see you. FYI, you have to cook the eggs. What the fuck? 38 pairs of shoes. Write that down, 38 pairs. We got an angel here. Angel. Seven pounds. I mean dollars. Right. I thought I was in England for a minute. Brandy glass. That thing. A vase. Now, this is a family heirloom. My great-great-grandmother, 1899. Looks old. It's a lamp, right? Yes, and she had it in her parlor. It's pretty. She lived in Manchester. Christ all mighty. Hi Mom. Hi Sweetie. No. But Mom. This little hoodlum has been out stealing recycling, and she stole my plastic, and my glass. I'm sorry, I'll go. I don't want you hanging out with this hoodlum. Actually, we were gonna go play golf anyways. Oh, I understand how it is. Oh, I get it. You think that it's okay for you to leave. I'm not staying up all night, and I'm not gonna play chess with you later. Don't even ask me! And tell your goddamn father, Lily, to stop yelling! He's crazy! I just say have at it. Yeah, but what happened to your pool guy? It's not in me budget, quite right now. So why don't you start at the deep end and work your way towards the. You can see it's like a swamp. It's been weeks. You wanted me to clean the whole thing? Wait, what's that? The bottom of the pool. What's what? At the bottom. Oh my god, there's a dead lizard at the bottom of the pool. No, I can't get it. It's too deep. You're gonna have to jump in. With my clothes on? Yeah, it's gonna rot in my whole pool. Just take your clothes off. Okay, do you have a bathing suit? No, it won't fit you. You've got a fat ass. It's not that fat. Just get in there. Take your clothes off and get in. Honestly, I'm gonna have to drain the pool if that thing rots any further. Get in there. What, does he think he can swim? He's like, oh, look, a big, body of water. I'm one of those lizards that can run across the water, and then where is he now? On the bottom of the pool. Chip, chop, bottom of pool, pronto. Get down there. Get to the bottom of the pool. Bottom of the pool, bottom of the pool, bottom of the pool, bottom of the pool. What are you waiting for boy? I got your lizard, from the bottom of the pool. Oh, yeah! Come on, let's go. Come on. Can we get some scratchers? Hey! Excuse me. What are you doing? Show some respect to nature, okay. You're hammering a nail in a tree. That's disrespecting nature. This is where we put our mail. I got like eight more to put up. I don't have time to explain to you how this community works that you're clearly not a part of. I don't want to be a part of your community. Yeah, well the feeling's mutual. Is it? Yeah, my community is the greatest community. These trees are the only friends you have. You have no other friends but trees, that's why you probably. I don't need any other friends, all right. I got my friend right here. Say hello to my little friend here. I can't. Just go. I got messages to spread. We're a community. We have to enter that. 500 dollars, that's like. A week and a half of lottery tickets. Think of the money. Like 500 dollars, we could turn that into hundreds of thousands of dollars. We're entering this, yeah. But it's 50 dollars to enter. That's a lot. Yeah. I feel like. We could do that, but it's just one person, 50 dollars. Yeah. Yeah, we probably know who should enter. I mean, I would like to. Like, I've gotten a lot better, and I think I could really bring it, and I could really do a great job. You could bring it. Yeah. You could bring my bag. You could bring my bag. Like carry your bag? Like be my caddy. Do you want to be my caddy? Yeah. Sorry. Oh, where were you? - I was. - I know. Golfing. How? Well that's all you do. But that's what I wanted to talk to you about. How'd that contest go? The light break, nighttime contest? I lost. Did you? So that's another 20 bucks down the shitter. Oh, this came for you. Sorry. Dear Tenant, please leave. I love you. The MGM. It's an eviction notice, okay. You're being evicted and I'd like you to evict ASAP. - Okay, Dad. - Which means as soon as possible. I don't have time for this, okay. I'm cold. Hey, hey, hey, hang on a minute. You always avoid this topic. There's never any time, and I wanna discuss this now, because I could rent your room out, and I need to because I'm not doing well. Okay, you're 17 years old. I'm 20 years old. Okay, that's worse. You know, I ran away when I was 16. Just a little, faggoty kid, running down the streets of Chicago, and I had nowhere to go. I know you have a place to go. Don't you? No. Well, listen. Listen to me, I would be doing you a disservice if I let you stay here for free, and suck on my milkless teat for the rest of your life. You're doing nothing, nothing with your life. You don't have a job. You don't have a job. You watch your mouth, little lady. I'll wash it out with Ivory soap. Okay, I run an antiquities exchange. You run a junk shop. For the last time, it is an antique store, and I know it's not doing well. That's why I need you to, you know, stay with one of your friends, just maybe just for a couple months, up to a couple, forever hopefully. It's called leaving the nest. I should just push you out and see if you can fly. I need to Rent this room out. Okay. You're not doing anything with your life. Yes I am. I'm going to be a professional disc golfer. There's no such thing as a professional disc golfer! Okay, I'm out. I'll move out. Hey, hey, hang on a minute, hang on a minute. You do have a place to go, yeah? Yeah. Okay, because I'm not a devil. Yeah you are, but whatever. No, hang on a minute. I'm sorry I yelled. I'm sorry, but listen. This is gonna be good, this is gonna good. It's gonna be very good for you.

You gotta be in it. What do you mean? You gotta be in the zone. Oh, shit. Did we win? Yeah, yeah. - We won? - Yeah. How much? We won another one. Yeah, we won another one. Should've just gotten your money back. All right, just scratch it. I feel like you're glaring. You're glaring. They can't all be winners, okay. Did you at least win another one? No, but we'll get another one. Lose like 20 dollars every day. It's not just today. No. Yes. No. No. But it's still playing the odds. You know, like you still gotta, Oh my god. I won that free ticket. Oh my god, seriously, you literally sound insane, and I'm not about to just waste my life, Well, you know what? Trying to get you to get scratchers. You kind of sound like a bitch right now. - Okay, then I'm a bitch. - Maybe your dad's right. Do you want 50 dollars? Or do you want 50000 dollars? No, I don't care about having 50000 dollars right now. But you want 50 dollars. I want to just take a nap in my room, okay. In your room? Yes. You have a place to sleep because of me right now. I know, and thank you. My mom's asleep, my mom's asleep, 'kay? You're not sleeping. You can't fall asleep that fast. Lily.

Now, is it possible on the website of the internets, to get sound, song? Yeah. Then can I compose something? - Yeah. - Something like this? Yeah, that's pretty good. Are you laughing at me? No, I think that's really good. You're smiling. I'm smiling 'cause it's really good. Really? Yeah. It's really good. Yes, I like this, I like this, I like this so much. It's a little out of tune, but I blame the whistle. It's a little bent. I'm a professional. You know, I really need a metal slide whistle. These are just cheap, hard plastic. Show me the bells and whistles when you first see the main page. What are they gonna see? How about we put you? - Oh, I like. - Do you like that? I like that. All right, let's do that. We'll put you. Oh, I like that a lot. Just my face. And then we'll have you hold. Oh, I see, right. I like that. We'll have you holding all your junk. I love it. We'll do one side. Can you stop? They're antiques, they're antiquities, they're expensive, and they're very old. Okay. I don't want to hear you say junk again. Just because it's old doesn't mean it's junk. Okay, sorry. Did you hear that? Did you hear that? Just because something's old doesn't mean it's junk, something like that, like, for a slogan. - That's pretty good. - Right. Yeah, that's actually really good. - Right. - Yeah, that's really good. Right! I've been looking for a slogan for years! I've got to write this down. There we go. Something about junk. - Junk. - You called it junk. I did, but it wasn't. Yeah, okay, don't bring your, no, it was something, what was it, how did it start? Just. Right, right, right, I got it, I got it. Just, hang on. Just, all that's coming to me is just junk, but that doesn't, that would be the worst. Just junk. We lost it. I just don't remember what it is. Just because it's junk doesn't mean it's junk. What kind of flibbertgibbet, flibbertigibbert idiot would come up with something like that? You're a real willow of the whisp, real mongoloid idiot. Lettuce, peanut butter. Yes, Nona? I have a thought. Well keep that one up, that's a change. I need 50 dollars. You need to stop thinking and start praying. You have got to stop the scratching. I'm not scratching. Then what? Disc golf. Yeah. So you're playing actual golf? It's like golf, but it would use a Frisbee. How do you hit a Frisbee with a golf club? You use a disc. There's no golf clubs. How do you get the disc into the little holes? Instead of the little holes, there's these big, metal, like chain, like baskets. There's a tournament this weekend, and we need 50 dollars to play, to rock it. We? Yeah, Lily. I'm out. No, no. Mom, she can totally win this. Please? Please what? That bitch is trouble. Which bitch? The which bitch behind me. Lily is my best friend, Mom. I know she can win this. She is like a disc golf god. Please? Fine. Lily, can you come here for a second? Oh, yeah. What's up? Yeah, could you just stop staring at me? It just makes me feel uncomfortable, that's all. I just wish that I could just stare at you without feeling like a creep. Guys do it all the time, right, and we don't say anything. No matter what we say you guys think that we're flirting with you. Yeah, I'd just prefer if you didn't, that's all. Well I'm gonna fuck you with my eyes. Enjoy your session. Yeah. Have fun. All right, first place today is Lily Fletcher. She's gonna be taking first place prize. Congratulations. Great game. Hey. Lily. Wait up. Hey, congratulations. Thanks, yeah. As you know, I work for Legacy, and we wanted you to come by the shop sometime, pick up some gear on us. Okay. And I was curious, are you serious about going pro? Yes, yeah. Well, we'd like to offer you a full sponsorship. Really? Yeah. I mean you're extremely talented young woman, and by representing Legacy Discs, it's gonna open up a ton of new opportunities for you to shine. Oh my god. I will not let you down. What about me? What? Do I get sponsorship too? We don't generally sponsor caddies. Oh, well yeah, sorry. I mean, I'm sorry, I can't then. Well then, I guess you're both sponsored. Really? Yeah, I mean we'll have to. - Oh my god! - Aw, sweet! Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll have to run it by my boss, but. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, run it by your boss. Thanks. Should be cool. Yeah, so, well you have my card. Come stop by anytime. Maybe later this week. - Okay. - Yeah. Thanks. Sooner than later, if you want. Yeah, I hope it's sooner than later. No, I didn't mean it like that. But, yeah. But you just said sooner than later. Oh yeah, don't put words in my mouth. - Okay, I'm not, but. - See ya later. Yeah, sooner than later. - Congratulations. - Thanks. - I think he likes me. - Yeah. Oh, look what I made. Looks good. Picked 'em right off the tree. Oh, by the way, I wanted to tell you, The Antique Roadshow is coming to town. Right. I know, I know. I'm going on. I thought it was appointment only. Oh no, I was planning on calling them today, making that appointment, but it's fascinating we're on the same. That's good. You're thinking like me. That's exciting. Well, I think I'm gonna pop into the philharmonic and see if they need a slide whistler. Oh really? That's so weird, 'cause I got you something. Oh, what is. What the fuck is this? It's a kazoo. I know. I know it's a kazoo. Why would you think I'd want that. Because clowns like slide whistles, and clowns use kazoos. I thought you would like this. I thought that's something you would like. I'm a clown? No, I didn't say that. You just said I'm a clown. You said, clowns like slide whistles, and you know I like slide whistles. So I'm a clown that's going to like slide whistles and kazoos. No, that's not what I said. I just said that, you know, that clowns they have to use those things. I didn't know. First of all, clowns don't use slide whistles. Slide whistles accompany the clowns goofy actions and pratfalls and trips. They honk a horn maybe. Now, I don't have any qualms playing the slide whistle for a clown, in, let's say Cirque du Soleil. It's a quite a very well known and well paying gig. I've no problem with that. But I, meself, am not clown, with a rubber nose, running around playing a slide. Clowns don't do that, git, please, try to understand there are clowns and there are musicians. I thought it was a nice gesture. It's a kazoo. Who doesn't like kazoos. Oh, right, you know who doesn't like kazoos? Me. Legacy Disc. Bitch you're a legend. Right, come on, let's do this. Hi. Yes, can I help you? Is Matt here? - Max. - Max here. Is Max here? Yeah, I don't know. Could we call him? Or bring him forward? Or let him know that we're here? I don't know, can you? Does Max work here? I don't know. Yeah, I'll be right back, yeah. Max! Welcome to Legacy Discs. Make yourselves at home. Right, welcome. Yeah, so this is where we manufacture pretty much everything. You know, we got discs over here. We've got discs right here. We've got some more discs right here. It's where we get the work done, you know. Pretty much just got discs. Yeah, feel free to touch them. It's all right. Oh, I wouldn't do that yet. Last week, we had Johnathon, he put his finger in there, and now he's Nine Finger Johnny. I'm totally serious. Nine Finger Johnny. Oh wait, I need to tie my shoe really quick. Ladies. Dad, Dad. Yeah. I'm over here. I'm in the lemons. Oh, Dad, guess what? What? I got a sponsor. Oh, I didn't know you had a problem. I don't have a problem. Was it alcohol? What? Oh my god, you're on drugs? You know what, you got a sponsor, you're ahead of the game. Look, my sponsor sucks. No, I didn't get a. He's in the hospital right now. He is? You know, pretty much, I'm this close to drinking. But you're not drinking. I'm having a little nip and tuck here and there. Maybe I could have your sponsor. Well, no, I don't have a sponsor like that. It's like, I have a sponsor with my disc golf. It's Legacy, it's like the biggest company in disc golfing. Oh. Yeah. You have like a thing where they pay you to play, finally. Yeah, yeah. So how much money did they pay you? Well, they don't pay me, they just allow me to go into tournaments to be able to win money, and they give me like shirts and stuff. Oh great, then you won't be naked. Guess what? I am sponsored in my slide whistle. You got a new sponsor. I got sponsored to play the slide whistle, in with a bunch of clowns. And they gave me t-shirts and red noses. Really? Yeah. It's a good job, good job for you. Dad, don't get mad, this is a good thing. It is good, but you know what's gonna be better, when they start paying you money. But it is good. I'm going to be making money. Good, good, good, good. I gotta keep moving or I just lose my momentum. Did you get a couple lemons? Yeah I did, I got. I got plenty. Yeah. Just put that down there. I will never watch Antique Roadshow again, or any public television for that matter. They humiliated me. Absolutely. They shunned me. Used to be my favorite show. This is what I do. I deal in antiquities, and they just didn't appreciate them. That fella, Frederick, that we had, he's a millennial, he just doesn't appreciate, he's an imbecile. Doesn't even know what an antique is. Totally humiliating. All he said was just bring more special things. These are special things. You brought your cell phone from the eighties. Hello, hello, who's calling? Nobody. You're being quite disrespectful right now. You bought this at Target. I was with you when you bought this at Target. Busted. I did try to pull one over on them. They almost thought this was actually Marilyn Monroe's hat case. A pasta strainer. Well, it's my grandmother's. They don't make 'em like this anymore. You ever see that color? Fucking hubcap. No, that's a vase. Jeep, Jeep? Oh, I did not know Jeep made vases. You brought a fucking bag of pennies. Look, you can see that's old, that's cracked. This is shit. Well don't. No, this is junk! Junk, junk, junk, junk, junk, junk, junk, junk, junk, fucking junk. Junk, that's what that shit is, it's all junk. Leave, you need to leave, get out. It's your junk. You are disrespectful and you're fired. Good. Good. Well, my website's done anyways. Hey, you wanted to see me? Just strapped. Can I get the key back to the front door? Is that why you wanted to see me? You don't want me to ever stop by? I'll make a key, but I just need it now, because. I can make a copy. I need it now. Well which one is it? No, I know, 'cause mine's right here, that's it. So, take this one off. Okay, that should be, oh, this is the P.O. box. My mail gets sent there. What is that? It's the key to my gun. It's the trigger lock. Why do you have that? I don't know. Well, I'm taking that with, what are all these? Hang on a minute, hang on a minute. What is this one? No, this one, this one, this one I'll take. All right, is that all? No, no, no, no, this is the back door. Both of these, the sliding door. Put that back on later. The gym membership. I need that. I need it back, 'cause I lent it to you like a year ago. You never go to the gym. Well, I'm gonna start going to the gym. I need to. I don't feel the same. You said that three years ago. Definitely don't need my IKEA family plan. Yes, we're still a family. 'Cause I don't know what this last one is, but I'm sure it's not for you. So I'm just gonna go ahead and figure out what they're for, and do you need this? 'Cause I could really use it. I got a lot of keys now. Yeah, I need that. What are you doing in there, honey? I'm taking a piss. You're not taking a piss. I hear you. I hear that. Fine. Get out of the bathroom. I'm fine, okay, please leave me alone. Just give me a second. You've been scratching. Mom, don't touch me, it's fine, it's nothing. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. You're so overdramatic, this is nothing. You're making this all about you, and it's nothing. Mom, it's nothing, okay, I'm fine. Will you stop! You're making this all about you, and it's not about you! Get your stuff out, out. You don't live here anymore. - What? - You don't live here. I am gonna leave, 'cause I'm sick of your bullshit. You're ruining my serenity. Oh, and you're serenity's more important than I am. Yeah, so make me homeless for your serenity. Fuck that! Hey! What are you doing? Hey, I got a trip planned for us. We're going on a trip. We are? Yeah, yeah, I packed your bag. - We're ready. - Where? We're going camping. We are? Yeah, we are. I love camping. I know you do. Sorry. Just be a little quiet. Sorry. The cooler's in the back, let's just go. Whoa, look at this, look at this. Boom, boom, boom. Look at you go. You got it, you got it. - Just like that. - Be real quiet, real quiet. Just like that. All right, you ready for me? I'm coming over. Here I come. Okay, all right. Okay, I'm coming over. I really don't know how to get over on this. I don't know how to do this. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay, I got this, you ready? Catch me. You might need to catch me. We're doing it. Okay. Whoa, okay, my foot is in the. You ready to catch me? All right, Bring it over. Oh my tits. Let go, let go, let go. You're good. What's going on? I got us both kicked out, so let's set up our tent. Yeah, it's gonna be fun. You made a tent before? That does not look right. What's going on? You're getting rid of the pool table? Well, I'm gonna sell it. I'm just moving it down to the store, so I can sell it. But you love pool. Nah. You like that? Using your millennial phrase, nah. Naw. Oh, it's naw. Naw. I thought it was nah. Nah. No. Doesn't really matter. Well I just came to grab some of my food that I left. Yeah, just don't take any of my food, okay. Especially the eggs. I know you love your eggs. Okay. Oh god, do you guys need help? Here let me get the door. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks. - Yeah. - Thank you. Let me check, let me check. There's only three. Can I check? I said two. Lily. Where's the basket? There you go. I dare ya. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Where'd that come from? - What the fuck? - Are you okay? Holy shit. It's okay, it's okay. - Whoa, whoa. - Sorry, sorry. Disc golf. Water break? - Yeah, water. - Water's a good time. Your nose is bleeding again. It is? Yeah, it's bleeding. The other one, the other. Were you the one kicking me? No, I kicked you a couple times, but I wasn't kicking you. Kicking me a couple times is kicking me. No, I. I thought we were friends. You were supposed to have my back. We are friends. Obviously not. No, I had your back. I just had to watch out for mine too. It's like mob mentality. They weren't attacking you. Exactly. But if I didn't kick you once or twice, gently, they would have come after me. My rib hurts from that. I'm sorry. I've been here for like 15 minutes. Welcome to my antiquities shopping. How can I help you? So, I'm looking to return this. Keep looking. 'Cause where did you buy it? I bought it here. No. There's no way. We don't sell junk. No, I did, I did. I have a receipt. Okay, well I have a policy. Which is, change, if the plan, who?
