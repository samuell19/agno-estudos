SHE LOOKS AT THE TREE. - MM-HMM. - SHE SEES THIS HOOD FIGURE, AND IT'S LIKE-- - HOODED FIGURE. - YEAH. SO SHE TRIES TO GET AWAY FROM IT, RIGHT? SHE'S RUNNING REALLY FAST. - YEAH. - BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW FAST SHE RUNS; THIS THING IS, LIKE, FLOATING AFTER HER, AND IT'S CATCHING UP WITH HER. - IT WAS FLOATING? - YEAH, IT'S, LIKE, FLOATING-- - HOW FAR? - I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S FLOATING AFTER HER ACROSS THE FIELD, ALL RIGHT?

[light breathing] [stairs creaking] [heavy breathing] [door creaking] [floorboards creaking] [light breathing] [floor creaking] [woman screams] - WHAT'S THAT? YOU ALL RIGHT? - SHE HAD A NIGHTMARE. SHE NEEDS HER INHALER. - WHERE IS IT? - I DON'T KNOW. OVER THERE SOMEWHERE. I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. HAVE A LOOK. - [breathing heavily] UH, IT'S NOT HERE. - WELL, COULD YOU CHECK THE BATHROOM, THEN? - YEAH, SURE. - DON'T TAKE THE LIGHT! PUT IT THERE. - SORRY, SORRY. - [wheezing] - COME ON.

YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL. - YEAH, RIGHT. [sighs] [clinking] I FOUND THE CHURCH KEYS, THE OLD CHURCH ROLLS, AND THEN LOTS OF REALLY WEIRD SHIT. LOOK AT THIS. THEY DIED FIVE YEARS AGO. GOD, THEY'RE SO YOUNG AND SWEET. I MEAN, THAT COULD BE YOU AND LYNNE OR SCOTT AND ME. LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE BURIED TOGETHER. GRANDDAD MUST HAVE PERFORMED THE SERVICE. THIS IS WHAT REALLY FREAKS ME OUT. IF WE LOOK IN HERE, AT THIS NEWSPAPER ARTICLE FROM A LOCAL PAPER ABOUT HOW THEY DIED, THEY HANGED THEMSELVES, SOME FORM OF SUICIDE PACT, FROM THAT OLD TREE. HERE'S ANOTHER FILE THAT'S SO SIMILAR. LOOK AT THE COUPLE, AND THEY HANGED THEMSELVES AT THAT TREE TOO, AND... I THINK GRANDDAD BURIED THEM TOO. I MEAN, UGH, THE THOUGHT OF GRANDDAD DEALING WITH THIS ALL ALONE. - WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE? - THAT'S THE WORST ONE. ANNE MASTERS AND JASON BROWN. THEY WERE BURIED JUST THREE DAYS BEFORE GRANDDAD DIED. WHY COUPLES? WHY HERE? - THERE'S THIS PLACE IN LONDON. IT'S A BRIDGE. IT'S GOT A LONG DROP TO A ROAD BENEATH IT. IT'S KNOWN AS SUICIDE BRIDGE. PEOPLE, THEY COME FROM ALL AROUND TO, UH...WELL, END THINGS THERE. I GUESS PLACES GET ASSOCIATED WITH IT. MAYBE THERE'S LIKE A... I DON'T KNOW, LIKE A WEIRD SENSE OF CAMARADERIE ABOUT IT. [indistinct conversation] - SO HOW LONG WILL YOU BE STAYING? - JUST THIS WEEKEND. AND THEN WE HAND OVER THE KEYS. OH, THIS IS JAMES. - AH, JAMES. - HELLO. - CHARLES JOHNSON. - NICE TO MEET YOU. - AND YOU. - GRANDDAD'S OLD PARISH IS DISAPPEARING AND BEING MERGED WITH ST. JOHN'S. WILL YOU MOVE TO ST. JOHNS? - WELL, IT'S NOT CONFIRMED YET. ANYWAY, EMMA, JAMES, I'M OFF TO A MEETING. SO IT'S BEEN LOVELY TO MEET YOU. - REVEREND, THERE WERE A FEW THINGS I FOUND IN WITH GRANDDAD'S STUFF, UM, STUFF TO DO WITH SUICIDES. - UM... SORRY. WOULD YOU MIND IF WE JUST TURN THE CAMERA OFF? - YEAH, SORRY. - EMMA, TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST, IT'S NOT SOMETHING I AND THE COMMUNITY DISCUSS. - YEAH, BUT SO MANY SUICIDES OVER THE YEARS. I MEAN, MY GRANDDAD MUST HAVE BURIED THE LOT OF THEM. - EMMA, THE LEGEND JUST ROMANTICIZES SOME HORRIFIC EVENTS, SO-- - WHAT LEGEND? - WELL, I THOUGHT YOU KNEW. - HAVE THERE BEEN SUICIDES RECENTLY? - OH, NO. NO, NOT FOR A LONG TIME. UM, ANYWAY, ENJOY DUNWICH, AND THANK YOU FOR THESE, AND HOPEFULLY, WE'LL SEE YOU HERE AGAIN SOON. TAKE CARE. BYE. - THAT WAS SO WEIRD. DID YOU GET THAT? ARE YOU RECORDING? - YEAH. GOD, YEAH. - GOOD. - LOOK AT THIS. THAT'S DEFINITELY THE TREE, RIGHT? - THAT'S DEFINITELY THE SAME ONE. IS THERE A DATE ON IT? - 1650.

NOT PERFECT PREFECT EMMA. - OH, I'M SURE SHE DID. - NO, NO, SHE-- SHE BROUGHT PUNCH TO THE PARTY, AND I'M PRETTY SURE THAT EVERYONE ELSE BROUGHT DRUGS, DIDN'T THEY, DARLING? [laughter] - DO YOU REMEMBER THAT GIRL WHO WAS SICK IN THE KITCHEN SINK? - OH, GOD, YEAH. - WASN'T SHE ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS, LYNNE? - YEAH, SARAH BOYD, SHE GOT A BIT CARRIED AWAY. [laughter] - SO DISGUSTING. - UH, WELL, I THOUGHT IT WAS A PARTY; THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. [all screaming] - FUCK! - WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT? - SCOTT, SCOTT, SCOTT, GIVE ME THE CAMERA. - WHY? - SCOTT, GIVE ME THE CAMERA. THERE'S A LIGHT ON THE CAMERA. - CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN. - SHH. SHH. - PUT IT OVER THERE. PUT IT OVER THERE. [wings fluttering] [all screaming] - OPEN THE WINDOW SO AT LEAST IT CAN FLY OUT THEN. - JUST STOP MAKING NOISE. - GET IT OUT. - CALM DOWN. IT'S JUST A BIRD. - SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH. - [laughs] IT'S GONE. IT WAS A BIRD. IT WAS A BIRD. - [laughs] - COME ON, MAN, DO IT. - I'M DOING IT. - ALL RIGHT, TURN IT DOWN. - HEY, GUYS. - YOU GOT IT?

WE NEED TO TALK. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - FILMING. - WHAT ARE YOU FILMING FOR? - AN INSIGHTFUL DOCUMENTARY ON LOCAL FISHING HABITS. - WHITING, COD, BIT OF SEA BREAM. [chuckles] LOOK AT THAT. - EMMA, THIS KNOWLEDGEABLE YOUNG MAN KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE LEGEND. - NO WAY. - SO IN MEDIEVAL TIMES, THE MONK FALLS IN LOVE WITH THE SQUIRE'S DAUGHTER. AND THEY'RE FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. SO THEY HUNG THEMSELVES IN A LOVER'S PACT FROM THE OLD HOLLOW TREE. - OOH... - THAT'S ONE VERSION. - WHAT'S THE OTHER? - SAME MONK, SAME SQUIRE'S DAUGHTER, BUT HE PURSUES HER, BUT SHE WON'T HAVE HIM. SO HE STRINGS HER UP. THE SQUIRE CATCHES THE MONK, HANGS, DRAWS, AND QUARTERS HIM. - OOH... - WHICH DO YOU PREFER? - WHAT DO THEY SAY ABOUT GREYFRIAR'S HOLLOW TODAY? - UH, WE JUST AVOID IT. IT'S A BAD PLACE WITH A BAD HISTORY. WHATEVER YOU TAKE IN THERE... YOUR HEAD GETS TWISTED. - [chuckles] - BUT THEN I-- WELL, I PITCHED IT. - PITCHED IT? - I PITCHED IT. I OFFICIALLY ASKED THEM. [windshield wipers thumping] [murmuring] [fly buzzing] - EMMA, LOOK AT THIS. - CAN YOU LEAVE THE CAMERA? - I HAVE FOUND THE KEY TO THE MYSTERY. - WHAT IS IT? - THERE'S A CHAPTER ABOUT THE HAUNTING OF GREYFRIAR'S HOLLOW. "SINCE MEDIEVAL TIMES, THE AREA HAS A HISTORY OF HANGINGS AND SUICIDES. LEGEND HAS IT THAT THE GREYFRIAR CAN GRANT ABSOLUTION TO LOVERS WHO DIE THERE." WHAT'S ABSOLUTION? - SO SUICIDE IS A CARDINAL SIN, WHICH MEANS YOU GO TO HELL. IF YOU GET ABSOLUTION, YOU CAN STILL GO TO HEAVEN. - BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE LOCALS THINK. THEY BELIEVE THAT THE SPIRIT IS MALEVOLENT AND WILLS PEOPLE TO EVIL DEEDS. [laughs] LISTEN TO THIS: "AFTER A SPATE OF SUICIDES IN 1983, THE LOCAL PARISH WAS REQUESTED TO PERFORM AN EXORCISM." - WHERE WAS THIS BOOK? - THE DRAWER IN THE HALLWAY DRESSER. - BUT I CLEARED THAT OUT YESTERDAY. JAMES? - NO, I'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE. - SCOTT, YOU'RE MUCKING ABOUT. - NO. SO I THINK IT'S TIME WE SET THE MOOD. - OH, MY. - IS THAT NOT THE BIGGEST, FATTEST BAG OF CHARLIE YOU HAVE EVER FUCKING SEEN? - FUCKING HUGE. - THERE'S ONLY FOUR OF US.
