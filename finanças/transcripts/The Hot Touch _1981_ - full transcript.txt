A jewel thief only needs a scale calibrated in karats to measure the worth of his prize. That's alright, ladies, come on in. A bank vault can be measured in terms of money, but art forgery requires a genuine esthetic sense. That's the most interesting part: a genuine esthetic sense on behalf of the perpetrator. - For a psychologist, you're not a very good judge of character. - Why? - Some skirt chaser. - Now, are there any questions? Yes, the gentleman in the back. - Yes, sir. You seem more interested in the nature of the crime, but, uh, what are the legal consequences? - Well, first of all, you know, to paint a copy is not a crime. You can walk into any museum you see, art students copying the masters every day. But the crime is not in painting, but in selling. Someone who goes and sells a copy as if it were an original, that constitutes the fraud. - You make him sound pleasant, a friendly neighbour with a strange habit or two. - Ha ha! Well, maybe I sound a little like one of those cops in the film who gets to the point where he admires the criminal. I don't know. Uh, you're Miss, uh...? - Dr. Simpson. - Ah, Dr. Simpson. Yes, sir. - What about investors, those who are in it as a business? - It's a good question. What with inflation today the way it is and people losing confidence in their currencies, gold going up and down; yes, there's a lot of money being invested in art. When that happens, it means there are more buyers and, ultimately, that means forgers. People are now always what they seem. - That's true, Mr. Fairchild. And if you were a forger, how would you manage to get away with it? - How are you? Had a terrible morning. - I'm very sorry to hear that. Judge Jackson is all set up.

You mean to tell me this thing here ain't real?! - Oh, it's real alright, but it's a real copy. Picasso didn't paint it. - Pity. Dreadful loss.
