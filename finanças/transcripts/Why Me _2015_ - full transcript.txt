WHY ME? March 2002 Hello. Hi there. Hello. Hi there. Hello. Hello. Haven't they started renovating here yet? It's chaos downstairs. They'll move us in 2 days. New furniture and everything. About time, too! I saw you on TV on Friday. The thing with the deputy. You looked great! Thanks. Is case 301 ready'? With the investigation plan? Yes. I wanted to ask... What does it say here? “Undoubtedly”. Thanks. I'll bring it later. Hi. Boss came looking for you. Three times. Doesn't he know I'm off to court? Perhaps ifs urgent. We're out with the boys tonight. See you at 8, right'? We're going to Regie campus? Hello, lads. Hello, boss. You are starting late, now you're a star? - No, I'm just come from court... - Calm down! Why so serious? You'll be prosecuting me, next! By the way. Your "friend", deputy Antoniu is still making threats on TV. He thinks he runs things. He's got a nerve. The evidence is rock solid. He's still trying: saying the leasing company did who knows what, or that the GPS didn't work. - He'll be on TVR tonight. - Are you surprise? This guy's small fry. Want to see a real smart-ass'? His name's Bogdan Leca. You know the case, right? Serious bribery. The magistrate from Oradea'? I heard things. Probably the sound of him counting money. - I've never dealt with the case. - You will now. It's our number one priority. He's got interests everywhere. For the right money he can fix sentenoes and steal documents. Serious stuff. A search might turn something up. You're going to have to work hard. Leam the case by heart. Unless you're armour-plated, he'll eat you alive. He's a slippery character. - I've got a deadline tomorrow... - Not like this one. You need to be on it 24/7. It's serious. Guys like Leca can make the press scream about judicial corruption. When he fans, he makes us all stink. We've got to move quickly. I see there're loads of statements. What was I saying? Give him time, and he'll speak to the right people. Before you know it, he's clean as a whistle. I want an investigation plan in 2 days. In a day or two we leave to Oradea. What? We're leaving together'? Don't worry! It's your case! Name's going to take it from you! Bye. What is it? About the delegation. Did you hear about an extension? That's why I said to hurry. People are wondering if you're the next big thing. If you want to win them over, bring in Leca. Then you'll be untouchable. Good evening. I'm Cristian Panduru. ls the Minister here'? Yes. Come in. "Ph. D. thesis“ - Good evening! - Good evening. Sorry to disturb you at home, but I've been so busy this week. Don't worry. I managed to make some headway this weekend. I went to my mother's for some peace and quiet. I wasn't so lucky. Still, I finished my notes on two chapters. Come in! - No, I... -Come on! It's my husbands birthday, you already know him. No, really... General Prosecutor is also here. It's OK. I'll wait here. As you wish! I'll be back. I'll wait here. All the observations are here. I added a few titles to the bibliography. The casework is exoellent - unsurprising, given your experience. Thank you. I'll try to finish the modifications by the start of April. Don't rush, you're on schedule. I understand you've been given Leca's case. - Today, out of the blue. - You'll have a busy few weeks! My girlfriend is waiting for me in the car. I'd better go. OK! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. You took your ti me. I'll go home. I have to wake up at 5. They'll pick me up at 6. Can't they pick you up at mine? You'll get up so early'? If I have to! We have to film a report with shepherds. The oountryside was so beautiful. Half an hour from the Transfégérégan road. You couki come hr 'he weekend. Your mother is looking for trouble! She sends you back with so much... She was like that as a little girl. if she had an apple, she'd share it. I was older, and a real little madam! That's everything. We'll head downstairs. Can't I make you something? No! We've plenty, and ate on the way here. Good night! Deputy Antoniu, let's clarify this onoe and for all. You organized the theft of the BMW for the insurance money? Yes or no? I wasn't involved. I can say that with confidence. I'm a politician. I'd never be involved in something so absurd. Though we're talking a sum of 100,000 German Marks. So? I hope you'll ignore Prosecutor Panduru's slanderous accusations. MrAntoniu, who do you think will win this showdown? Hopefully, the truth will out. The prosecutor has repeatedly ignored correct legal process. Action has to be taken against him. He has no business working as a prosecutor. Even so, you've been accused of giving false evidence and attempted fraud. Mr Turcescu, this is a politically motivated set-up. I'll be able lo explain once this is all over. Hello? You're unbelievable! You said you'd be here at 9. It's 10 already! If you're not here in 30 minutes, I'll make an official oomplaint! I'm ooming. I've got something to finish, then I'm off. OK. Bye. Bye. You've got to live your life! Listen to me! Leave it - he's always been top of the class. I know what he's like. Some people work, others sit drooling over sluts! Sluts, huh? Look at Enrique! Enrique'? He's better than that! He must be getting private salsa classes, while we think he's chained to his desk! Has nobody kissed you on the lips before? Yeah. But never straight out like that. Sorry if I took advantage. - Student? - Yeah. - Polioeman? - Yeah. And they teach you Latin dancing, too? Sometimes. - I ironed you this, too. - Thank you, auntie. Aren't you taking too many? I don't know how long I'll stay. And I can't wear the same shirt for two days. You're always rushing off! You in one direction, that girl in another! Me and your mother will be long gone before you get your own place. I said the same to the woman downstairs. Her daughter's a doctor, and all she does is work. She's 34, and still single! I don't have time for this right now. The visit is really important. And when you're talking to your friends, never mention my job, or the visits. - Got it? - Ya. I'm off. Not a word! Bye! Hello. Hello. First, to Floreasca, and fast. To Penescu. Mrs Penescu? Yes. She's coming with us. She's got a customs investigation. A second opinion from an experienced prosecutor will be useful. Good moming. Good moming. - We're meeting Leca tomorrow at 9? - Yes. I'll try to come too. But at 10 I have to be at County Hall. You're leaving him on his own? What are you, his mother-in-law'? The search is the day after tomorrow. What are those? Old statements. From two witnesses. I've made it clear: the accusations are in the written statement. Why won't you sign? Shall I read it again? Once more: why is the presence of chief prosecutor Codrea necessary? Mr Leca, I'm not part of the investigation. I'm here to supervise their research and the respect of procedural norms. The law says nothing about the supervision of prosecutors. Dear colleague, ifs hardly new. Not at least back in Bucharest. Don't get the wrong idea: I'm hereto make sure everything is done correctly. Let's continue. Please sign the written statement. You're driving me crazy! I've asked you to detail the facts that form the basis of these accusations. One: committing the offenoe of the theft of documents, as stipulated in article 242 of the Penal Code, specifically the... What was stolen? When'? Where? I won't sign anything that doesn't stipulate the accusations against me. A written statement can't take any other form. From the start of this interview you've been informed of all the accusations. Dear colleague. Don't try to teach me my job. Tell me on what day, when, and how, I stole the documents. I want to know exactly what I'm accused of. Excuse me. It's urgent. You're sleeping on the job. You let him run rings around you. We got caught up in procedure. We'll get him, though. All of the accusations are equally important. Hurry up, we'll be here all night! - Do you want me to take over? - No. There's no need. OK. Let's continue. Two: the offence of theft, stipulated in article 266 of the Penal Code, namely... So, you're carrying on? In that case, I'd like to bring in my lawyer. I called him while you were gone, and he can't make it before 12. I assume it's fine to suspend the hearing a couple of hours? I didn't expect someone like you to obstruct the investigation in this way. We'll never finish. Finish what? I've already told you why I'm here. Because I dared to arrest Haidéu, the county's biggest briber! And what did I get him for? A minor incursion? Afight in a bar? No way! Tax evasion totaling He and his buddies were selling petrol and putting it down as kerosene! No duties, no taxes! Have you any idea what the budgetary losses add up to? We're going round in circles. You ought to know! You ought to know about tens of thousands of tons of petrol! Who do you think ordered his release? Who do you think he paid off? Mr Leca, I'm aware of these details. I'm also aware of the charges against you, involving illegal arrests and investigations. What was illegal'? Didn't he run the business? Didn't the money enter Haidéu's account? When was the last time you met Lajos Molnar? I don't know him! I've never spoken to him! How oould he have bribed me'? The accusation of bribery data from... I'll explain. First, I'd like to raise further objections. Please, Mr Leca! Mr Prosecutor, this is inadmissible. My client wishes to make amendments. The written statement has already been signed. We've allowed enough time for amendments. What planet are you on'? I can make dozens of amendments if I want! You can't make dozens of amendments to a written statement. All you've done so far is obstruct the investigation. Good afternoon. I'm lawyer Kerezsi Francisc. Your colleague ripped the written statement from Mr Leca's hand, and it tore. No. Mr Leca wanted to modify something he'd already signed, which I refused. You don't understand basic procedure! You're obstructing the investigation! Gentlemen! This is pointless. You're behaving like children. Please make the additions you see fit. - Go ahead. - Thank you. Remember that from now on, you won't be the one asking the questions. OK? Minister Boariu Are you avoiding us now'? - Good evening. - Take a seat. Hello. I hear Leca has got you tied up in knots. I thought you had work at the customs office? You weren't this oocky with Leca, were you! That wasn't an interrogation, Mr Prosecutor. You let him run rings around you. I didn't let him do anything. I merely followed procedure. What prooedure? Did you disoover anything'? This sharpster has a file so big that you'd struggle to carry it. And you let him go on about that small-timer Haidéu. Did you see? I didn't interfere! I don't want you complaining that your boss keeps meddling. But do you ever listen to me? You keep pushing ahead with that written statement, giving his lawyer an axe to grind. I hope the search won't be like the interrogation... - The 'witnesses? - They'll wait for us inside. Hello. Good luck. Take care. Mr Bogdan Leca? Prosecutor Cristian Panduru from the General Prosecutor's office, Special Investigations. On the basis of resolution we will proceed with a search in accordance with the legal provisions. You're well aware that waiting for us with another cameraman isn't in accord with the law. Officers, please present yourselves. Lieutenant Mu§at, General Police Inspectorate. Who are you? Ovidiu Florea, Criminal Investigations Directorate. The forensics expert, who will carry out his duties. Please leave the building. You have no official function here. They're my guests, in my house. Guests from the local TV station? I'm sorry, but this isn't procedurally correct. Not procedurally oorrect? A search is now taking plaoe. They can't film during a search. Please. As a reporter, your presence here is illegal. We're about to initiate a criminal investigation, not a field-day for journalists. Please remove the camera from... I want oontrol over what goes on. - Leave the building. - No, stay here. Nobody can... You've filmed the beginning, now please leave the building. I'm in my own house! Please remove the individuals who are not taking part in the search. Why can't they take part? I want to make sure... Sir, you are currently under investigation! - I want control over... - What do you want to prove? What do you want to prove? It's a method of being sure of the legality of what you're doing. I assure you that everything will take place according to the legal provisions. - We have a forensics specialist, who... - No, No... I think I wamed you, Sir. Please! Wait! Let them film the house beforehand. I want to be sure that... - Article 100 of the Penal Code... - Why does it bother you? - Because they're here inside. - They just came to... You just knocked on the door and came in... A search has to take place according to certain rules. What rules? Let's read them! We have the forensic specialist, the assistant 'witnesses... “Article 100 allows...” Article 100 allows a search to take place. Your presence here isn't oorrect. A search will take place because it has been authorised. I'm caught between two prosecutors! No, you're caught between a prosecutor and the aocused. ...who benefits from the presumption of innooence. Of course, the presumption of innocence, that's the procedure. Please... Mr Leca. You're a magistrate. Have you ever carried out a search? Was the press waiting for you inside? - It's not about the press... - I warned you. Please leave... They're in my house, I want them to take pan in a... No. You're currently being searched by a warranted prosecutor. Please leave the... Don't use force! Then, I'd be... I remind you that we're about to begin a 'manu militari' search activity. Once again, your presence isn't... Don't block the door! You're blocking us! You intend to hold us here? Because... you started... You're behaving like you're in charge here, in my home, kicking out whoever you like. - Are you doing the search here? - No. So what are you doing, then? You said you'd begin a search, not a... I want to use the toilet, outside. What's the problem? Leave the door alone! Why'? Maybe I like the lock! Stay inside! I want to go out. Why? Because. In the middle of a search? Is someone outside giving you orders? Since when are you telling me what to do'? I want to go to the toilet! Use the toilet here! What's going on? You're holding us here? Please stop sabotaging the search. You've been pushing your luck all morning. What's the problem if someone sees how you're behaving'? My problem is that you're obstructing our procedure, creating a spectacle. I'm in my own home. I'll even install CCTV if I want to! Look at him! He's... Please calm down. Calm down while you plant evidence on me? I know who sent you! The Prime Minister! Don't start making insinuations. You've begun search activities! You're keeping us here. The conditions for a search haven't been met. Holding you here? How? We'll draw up a written statement, then... The conditions for a search are no longer met. I'd like to leave the property. - You're not carrying out the search? - Not under these conditions. What you're doing is... We came in conformity with the legal provisions. With assistant witnesses, with your lawyer present. But you waited for us with the press. You must be scared of something. Yes? That's what I'm doing. A masquerade" .! You'll suffer the consequences for obstructing the... Please conduct the search! You don't want to carry out a transparently monitored search! - Make the search! - Don't tell us what to do. The law stipulates the conditions for a search. Not you. I suspended it. It was impossible. You let him play games, again. You should have hauled the cameraman out. That's our job? Roughing up journalists? - Now you're lecturing me? - Stop! We're getting nowhere! You should fucking arrest him, fast as you can. - We're wasting ti me! - Give it a rest! Did you find anything? I couldn't! You couldn't? You fucked it up, that's what you did! And I'm the one who'll get his ass kicked! It's my fault for trusting some kid who's still wet behind the ears. What would you have done in my place? Anyway, the case will continue in Bucharest. Sure it'll oontinue! I'll tell you how! You'll take those witnesses and squeeze them till they give you every last drop! Is that clear? It's clear. There's no other way. He won't have chance to put on another show in public. Let's go. I'll walk. See you at the hotel. Mr Leca, among other things, you've been aocused of bribery and stealing official documents. How will you defend yourself? Let's make things clear. This is a network run according to clear mafia rules. I was naive enough to think I could challenge them legally. The list of charges says otherwise. You're accused of many things, including unauthorized arrest. I just explained all this. So, you're a prosecutor, but you have no faith in the justioe system? Given the current situation in Romania, it's hard to have faith. Prosecutor Panduru insisted that the film crew be removed from the house, without offering legal justification. My oolleague from Bucharest is being manipulated. He's young, with just 3 or 4 years' experience. The victim is a businessman from Oradea, under investigation for fraud and money laundering. Next to the victim's body we found a file of documents that will be analysed by investigators. The body showed no signs of a struggle. Don't get so worked up. That's how it works. One day they build you up, the next they knock you down. But they're right. He had the upper hand. And he took me for a fool, trying to sell me all kinds of bullshit. I've not seen such a slippery character for a long time. A real old fox! With friends in high places. Yes. I'll get him for something, don't worry. Yes? Great. Thank you. Witness Molnar has come in for questioning. Hello. Hi, Mimi! Mr Prosecutor, the Oradea Inspectorate replied. They can't call in the witness Bontlidean. He hanged himself a few days ago. I'm sorry. Last year you made a statement about the behaviour of Prosecutor Bogdan Leoa. You described it as 'harassment'. I went back and forth between the polioe and the prosecutor's office, they told me to be 'more understanding'. Court cam are expensive. What exactly did he ask for? 5,000 German Marks. How did you give him the money'? I put it in a briefcase. He came to my offioe. He wrote 5,000 German Marks' on a piece of paper. He spoke quietly, pointing to the phone to 'shhh...' So he offered you a file for 5,000 German Marks. How did you reoeive it? I got it from Racz Atilla. Who? Trompi. A friend of mine. He has a petrol station. So Leca didn't give it himself? No. You're not blameless. You oould take a couple of days off. The girl has a point. Since when are you some expert? You've never got bogged down in a case? Course! Military prosecutors do just as much. But I forgot! You're on a different level now! MY apologies! Do you know what I'm working on now? How couldn't I! It's there every time I open a newspaper, or turn on the TV. So, how's it going? I get the feeling somethings escaped me. Just make sure that someone doesn't escape you! This Leca guy seems ready to pull all the stops. He knows everybody. He's connected to all the politicians. And he pretends to be a crusader forjustioe. Give me a break! That's the problem. Someone must know something, or have something concrete. I'm sure someone has breathed down his neck... What do you want now? Acoess to “Top Secret" files? Are you crazy? You're being serious? What? You said you knew someone at the Romanian Intelligence Servioe (SRI). Where...? The SRI. I hope I didn't hear you right. Do you know who they draw up those files for? Do I look like a minister to you? I can get to Cabinet 1, that's all. That'd be a start... $erban, believe me, any information would help. Anything. You are crazy. No doubt about it. How was your arrest, Mr Haidéu? I was under arrest for two days, right in the middle of the Holy Celebrations. Due to heart complaints, I was moved to hospital - and why? Because I didn't give in to Prosecutor Leca's pressure. Or because my father wouldn't help him to become Chief Prosecutor. How do you respond to accusations of trafficking contraband petrol? How would you respond to something you know nothing about! Is it true that the Prime Minister intervened to secure your release? Thank you, but I have no further statements to make. Prime Minister, what do you think about Mr. Haidéu being arrested? I thought you'd ask me about the discussions we've ended regarding the budget rectifications. But if you think that this is a pressing topic for Romania, then... Honestly, I don't have much faith in arrests that take place on a Friday night. They're perfectly placed to make the weekend news. Based on your information, are the accusations of oontraband justified? You tell me. I don't study Judicial cases. The media, by oontrast, passes judgment, hands down verdicts. So I'll wait for you to tell me the outcome of this case. Thank you. Hi Dora. I called you. You're reproaching me? I'm disturbing you, right'? No, not at all. - I really wanted to oome, but... - Are you crazy? The whole team lefl, I was left waiting like a fool. I had to hitchhike, twioe, to get to a station. Dora, believe me, it's been chaotic, I haven't had time to even think. - I called as soon as... - As soon as you remembered some idiot was waiting for you in the middle of the mountains? When you saw I didn't answer, couldn't you come to check I was OK? If I hadn't come at all, would you notice? For all you care I might have disappeared! Is that how it seems? What's wrong with you'? I'm sorry. You're so tense! Speak to me, at least! Let it out! Auntie? Yes. Happy Birthday. - Thank you. - This is for you. - It's nice, isn't it? - Thanks, it's lovely. And I made some cookies for your colleagues. I can't, I have to go to the university. You can't go to the office empty handed. Please! And these! I'd better go. Thanks a lot! Bye! We'll also consider the multiplicity of offenses next time. It'll be in the test. Just in case you want to do some last minute cramming. The only 'cramming' we'll do is eating during Easter! OK, see you next week. Hey! Hello. You're the first polioeman I've seen giving lectures here. And you? What are you doing here? I'm in the seoond group. Shame I'm not in yours! All the gifls here are crazy about you! Will I see you again? I see you're spying on me anyway. Can I escape? Not really! I brought you something. For your birthday. He looks like you. A bit stubborn. And tough. Like a policeman. How did you know ifs my birthday? Didn't you say I'm a SPY? Surprise! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! I have to leave. So soon? I'm busy tomorrow at 8. You're really something. Don't you ever put this thing down? Happy Birthday. Did you look at it? Is it important? You'll see. Your friend Leca wasn't making everything up. Listen carefully. This envelope doesn't exist. Got it? It doesn't exist. Thanks. Take care. I mean it. What are you doing? Cristi, wait... What are you doing with my papers? If you don't want to tell me anything, then... You think ifs OK to go through my things? What are you doing? Spying on me? Forgive me. What did you find out? Are you happy now? What did I do? Big deal! Stop being so suspicious! I want to know what's wrong with you! Al least allow me that! Or would you prefer it if I didn't care? No. I don't want you involved in this. That's all. Cristi, I couldn't care less what you get up to with your friend. Or with the SRI. Anyway, I didn't understand a think about those wiretaps. I guess someone's laundering money, there is oontraband over there... Oh, it means nothing to you! That's why you're up in the middle of the night, because it doesn't interest you, right'? I only care about you. It hurts me to see that you've beoome someone else. You're here with me, but really you're somewhere else, Cristi. Hello. Come in, Mr Prosecutor. Hello. Hello. I presume you've had the honour of meeting the chief of department. I like to believe that we're all busy, and so I'll gel right to the point. Your superiors have assured me you know how to stick to your deadlines. I was expecting you to have already started criminal proceedings in the Bogdan Leca case. I'm still working on the evidence... Perhaps if you hadn't made such fools of yourselves during the search, we might already have some evidence. And if we had evidence, perhaps we'd also have an indictment! An unexpected situation came up... What did you two expect? That he'd greet you with flowers? With open arms? I was the one who made the mistake of letting you go it alone. Of trusting you. I should have taken care of it personally. The Special Investigations department is fully capable of... Yes, so we've notioed! Information has come to light, which might bring a new perspective to the case. What kind of information? Specifically? And what kind of perspective are we talking about? Ah! You won't share it with us. I'm in the process of investigating. I need a few more days. Sorry! Please forgive my indiscretion. Mr Prosecutor, what's eating at you? Is there any money left in Oradea has not found its way into Mr Leca's pockets'? It's not that. Mr Prosecutor, you knew what to do with this case in the very beginning. If your boss tells you to do something... You do it! Otherwise you're out! And you can get a job as a doorman. I've got it. I'll do it. From tomorrow, every move, every piece of information, will be reported directly to me. No later than 8 am tomorrow, I want to a full report about this case on my desk. I said full. And by the day after tomorrow, I expect you to finalize your “theories”. It would be useful for you to benefit from the direct support of the Chief Prosecutor. That is all! Good day. I'm not putting myself on the line for you again. Got it? Honestly, I didn't know a thing about what my husband did at the company. Mrs Bontyidean, didn't say he anything about where the bulldozers came from? Mr Prosecutor, we don't talk about such things at home. What did Leca have against your husband? My husband clearly wrote in the papers he left in the red folder, from the... Mr Leca repeatedly committed abuses. He asked for money on many occasions, And called him to the prosecutor's office to preventatively oonfiscate his land. Leca called in the police, they made a house search at 7 in the morning. When you say he asked for money, do you have anything to back up this assertion? Did you discuss it? Were there witnesses? Did your husband leave behind any evidenoe you knew of? Come on, Mr Prosecutor. You think these things happen with 'witnesses'? With evidence? Mrs Bontyidean, I'd like you to tell me something. Did your husband write things down in a diary or notebook? I don't think so. I don't know. Anyway, the polioe took everything. The accounts, the company papers, the computers - everything. Leca behaved appallingly. Hey. How are you? I'm on a shoot, by the Village Museum. Will it last long? I only just arrived. Sorry about last night. These things happen. What's wrong? Are you OK? Yeah. Do you want me to come to yours this evening? No. I've lots to do. I've just started something, and... I'll tell you later. What do you mean? It could be on my way up or on my way down. I don't understand what you're saying. Let's speak tomorrow. Good moming. Hi. I bet you thought you'd never finish! Yeah. What's up? Why the long face? Lonuty, I need a favour. I've been calling Bucharest Police Dept for ages, with no success. Can you call and ask for Gabriel Mu$at and Ovidiu Florea. If they're not available, leave a mobile number. Hello. Hi. Is the boss in'? No. Do you want to wait for him? He said he won't be long. I'll come later. Should I say something? Please give him... No, I'll give it him myself. I reached the Polioe Dept. I spoke to one of the bosses there. He said he'd deal with it and call back. - Lonuf? - Yes? Come and see something. OK. And? What about it'? Good morning, and here's the news. Romania's General Prosecutor has confirmed the suspension of prosecutor Bogdan Leca, from the Oradea Court. The move oomes after the initiation of criminal proceedings for crimes including the illegal arrest of three people for trafficking petroleum products; favouring criminals in three oourt cases; and for the theft of documents. Hello. Can I get in? Hello. Please, hold on, he's on the phone. No problem. When ifs ready... Good day. There's no need. Absolutely. Yes. Yes. I just heard it on the radio. Should I find out like that? I have the impression you're holding me accountable? No, oi course not. The problem is that I've not yet signed to initiate the... So what are you waiting for? I told you, I'm investigating an issue which... Listen, son. Your deadline was for first thing today. The General Prosecutor thought he oould count on someone mature, who understands deadlines. He must have thought there was some reason why the decision to initiate criminal proceedings hadn't been delivered. He probably imagined a bureaucratic delay, not realising that the you needed an eternity to “investigate? Are you pulling Leca's trick? Working a case until it vanishes? No, until I find incontestable evidenoe. And when will that be? In which century? I need to go to Oradea again. - The witness statements conflict. - Why? To put on a show again? What do you think you can do there now'? Didn't you tell your direct boss that things were clear'? That you'd order the arrest? - At that point, I... - At that point what? You think Leca will be waiting for you with the paperwork oompleted and the confession prepared? What have you been doing until now'? Paperwork? If you're referring to the papers from the Oradea Prosecutors, then nobody can prove that Leca... Nobody? Who do you think is meant to prove it? My mother? Wasn't that your job? Tell me what stopped you. Or who? I told you... There are issues that could fundamentally alter the investigation. - I need time. - Do you think I'm like your boss, sonny? Always itching for a fight? I don't know why you need a few more days, but take them. You've got a weekend, too. But if on Monday, you don't have a plan in your hand, then I'll send you back to where you came from. We need good people in the provinces, too, you know... I see. Goodbye. - What do you want to do? - I have another 2 days. Think you can finish this? Do I have a choice? I don't know. I'll be leaving in 2 weeks, just so you know. What? The government made me an offer to work for them. It's complicated. I'll tell you some other time. Afax from the Police Dept. Thank you. - Is the boss here? - No. Mr Codrea? He's not here? Mr Codrea? No? Hello. What's up, boy? Something urgent? I've looked everywhere for you. Mu$at and Florea... Who...? The 'police officers' during the search. They're not in the Police Dept database... What, you think they were extra-terrestrials? There are too many things that don't add up. And... given Leca's case history, I think... You're being irrational. Are you getting enough sleep? That's got nothing to do with it. You oould do with 7 or 8 hours of sleep! I don't know what you see in this piece ofjunk like this. I bought it with my own money. I didn't get it as a 'gift' from someone else. Well, it's like you. What do you mean? I mean, it's different. And you're different. Secret Service Head of the “Haidéu octopus" Haidéu is having secret deals with the Services Haidéu keeps SERVICES... SECRET Is it at risk from earthquakes'? No, it's safe. The patio is beautiful. Yes, it's superb. There's storage space here. Here's the bedroom. You're lucky. The owner needs to leave to Italy urgently, and put the flat up for sale two days ago. This is the living room, the bathroom and kitchen... another entrance to the bedroom... It's bright and airy. Yes. They removed the door to give more light and space. What do you think, Cristi? It's nioe. How is it in winter? The block is pretty old. You won't have problems, it has its own oentral heating. Yeah? Let me show you the kitchen. It's rather small, but fully equipped. It's really small! There's a fridge-freezer, gas hob with hood, washing machine... You know, right now, I feel like giving up. If you didn't want to oome, you should have... Of course I wanted to oome. But I'm not sure anymore. I don't know if we'll be able to pay. Who knows what tomorrow will bring. Since you came back from that damn mission, you've not been yourself. What did you do? Were you brainwashed? I'd not thought about that. SRI (Romanian Intelligence Service) note. Top secret SRI (Romanian Intelligence Service) note. Top secret Come on, forget these fairy stories. I couldn't care less. I proved that Terim Kemal was a professional trafficker, a middle-man connected to the Iraqi military. And? “Cui prodest?" You'll leave before you finish with Kemal? Why do you think they want rid of me! You put him in prison. Big deal! They let him go after a month. Why should I care? You think Leca won't go to prison? He upset the 'services', Cristi. That's not good. You'd be crazy to say that the SRI is making money on the black for the guys at the top. He'll end up in prison anyway. Listen. I hope you're not going to be an idiot. Don't take the world on single-handed. Don't take the world on single-handed. Do you know how much petrol was trafficked to the Serbs during the UN embargo? About 30,000 tons. This guy, Haidéu, managed much more. 40,000, through a single oompany. He controls a whole network. He controls a whole network. The payments to the Party are like protection money. At least prosecutor Leca has tried the best. Come on Cristi. You're naive. Can't you see that the whole system is rotten? Even if you leave no stone unturned and fight to the bitter end, Even if you leave no stone unturned and fight to the bitter end, Codrea still has to give his official stamp of approval. And Romania is the land of official stamps, right? I get it. You're doing well. You've found a good job. Soon they'll give you an apartment, and you'll be a parliamentary candidate before you know it. What a faoe! You lost? Did you get an eviction notioe? Can I stay at yours tonight? I can't sleep if I'm stressed. Really? I leave to countryside tomorrow, we're filming. OK. And? I don't have a driver. Can you help out? Come on. You're not the only one with problems. I don't want you to smother me, or call me every 5 minutes. I just want you to care about me. I told you about this opening in the news department. I told you about this opening in the news department. I hear you have to give a $1,000 bribe. Anyway, I reckon they've given the position already. I was going to tell you earlier, but it's not as though you care. They've postponed the decision. Postponed? Why'? I've no idea. They didn't say. Maybe I'm wrong, but is ii really such a disaster if your superiors invalidate a decision? Or an ordinance, as you call it? It'll go their way in the end. Dora, you just don't get it. No! I don't! Why all this fussing and fighting? Why get into a oonflict with bosses? If they push you to do it, just do it! You're right, it's simple. It means I've wasted two weeks of work. It means I've wasted two weeks of work. Have I ever told you how proud I am of you'? Have I ever told you how proud I am of you'? You're the bat man I know. If I ever have a child, I'd like it to be like you. In every possible way. You know I'm not much into the idea of marriage. Sure. Until one of the offioe girls gets hold of you. Sure. Until one of the offioe girls gets hold of you. They're all crazy about you. Or kids either, for that matter. What kind of world do you want to bring them into? This one? This one? You want to marry the first guy you can! Yeah, sure! Oops! Look! Look what I found! No! “Decree to initiate criminal proceedings “Decree to initiate criminal proceedings for the crimes above, As cited in articles 264 and 266 in the criminal code.” in the criminal code.” You're sure? Give it me on disk, too. Good moming. Finally. Thank God! Sorry, there was no secretary. Have you gone completely crazy'? What's this, sonny'? “There are many contradictory elements." (Decision to release from criminal prosecution...) "lnsufficient evidence to support the existence of a crime.” I never start a criminal investigation, unless I'm oertain. There's no evidenoe. Wrong! You just couldn't find it! Wrong! You just couldn't find it! That's a possibility. One week ago, you were playing the tough guy. Saying you'd arrest Leca, that he's oorrupt. You were bristling for him. I didn't look deeply enough. What's certain is that, without consistent evidence, I... You what? You'll call the General Prosecutor a liar'? You'll call the General Prosecutor a liar'? You want to make a fool of this entire institution? You've been here for a year and already think you're smarter than everyone else? Not at all. But if the criminal investigation was publicly announced, when I hadn't even signed... They announoed it when they were supposed to! You don't go around telling the General Prosecutor what to do, and when. Exactly! So why did he do it? Exactly! So why did he do it? Because not everyone's asleep at their desks! Some people do their paperwork, in order to move on! Or perhaps because Leca was right when... Take Leca's side, why don't you'? "The thief's and... [the fool]"! That's right! Say it! “The thief and the fool"! Maybe that's what was intended, I was supposed to be fool who'd ignore the “Haidéu affair”. I was the guy who wouldn't see what's going on. You're suffering from paranoia. Maybe! Put an end to this nonsense! This is my proposed solution for this case. This is my proposed solution for this case. It's all I can do. Have a good day. What's up? What happened? Hello. I've come to ask when you'll be moving? Definitely not today. Sorry. Cristi, why are you such a contrarian? What do you get out of it? It was all a game. I merely thought I was a prosecutor. Son, I know you're tired. Leca's driven us all crazy reoently. Take a holiday. You've got three weeks. Get some oxygen into your lungs. Come back fresh, with a clear mind. Have a nice holiday. I don't need a holiday. I don't need a holiday. It's better that way. You'll have chance to think. Hello? "Ministry of Justice" Panduru from the Public Prosecutor Offioe. Sign here. Hello. - Good day. How can I help? - I'd like to talk with Mrs. Minister. Do you have an appointment? No. At this time, ifs impossible. You need to request a hearing, and will receive a registration number. What registration number? I'm here from the prosecutor's offioe. I'm very sorry, there's nothing I can do. Miss, please. It's urgent, and very important. Let me see. Panduru, right? Panduru. Sorry. It's like I said. Mrs Boariu, the Minister, is already very late. - I see. - Have a good day. Hello, auntie. Hello. How are you doing'? I just put out some washing. Can I wash your things? Yes. You're home already? I've got some days off. Really? You didn't say. Isn't that a good thing? Did anyone call or ask for me? No. What's wrong with you, sonny'? Please, don't allow any strangers in the house. Not here, and not downstairs at my place. But Cristi... - Let me make you something hot. - It's OK, I'll do it. That girl was looking for you. Poor thing. She seemed worried. Said she'd tried calling all moming, but your phone was off. Hello? Hi, Rare; What's up! Are you still alive? You changed your number? Yeah. Did I wake you up? No, I'm at the office. So, what about going fishing? Let's go this Saturday. Now? Really? OK, I'll speak to the boys. No, better if you don't. Well, how shall we do it? You pick me up at 5? Please leave a message after the tone. What's this, lonut'? Who are you? You've no right to go through my things! Gavrilescu. My oolleague, Rogojan. There's an order from the Chief Inspector over there. It's a routine inspection. What routine inspection? These are secret polioe tricks! You want to put me in prison? Cristi, calm down! You think I don't know who called you? Mr Prosecutor, I thought you were on holiday. Did I ask for a holiday? Please do not impinge upon our activities, OK? Can you photocopy something? Sure. Does the boss know'? Sure. What are you doing here? Working. Didn't I tell you, you've already done too much work'? It's time to rest. I never requested a holiday. You never get anything submitted on time! It's already been approved. - What are you doing? - I needed some photocopies for... Have you ended up like Leca? Stealing documents? Carry on like this and you'll end up like him. You're lucky I'm in a good mood. What are you looking at? Contact Manole for me. Sorry. I didn't mean to... Thanks. The whole file on the trafficking of contraband was systematically oovered-up by the magistrates from Oradea, who were repaid with promotions. I've read about stuff like this in the papers. But bigger stuff than this. If you have anything concrete, hand it over. I can't give you anything. They took the case. They want to frame me. You're being ridiculous. I spoiled my boss' plans. Leca is innooent. Big deal! Didn't you tell me that your bosses overrule you as they like? That you're subordinate to them? I've rocked the boat too much. I stuck my nose in where I shouldn't. Where? The whole business in Oradea was controlled and monitored by the SRI. Those carrying it out were offered support and protection, and when it all went wrong, then they brought in the “smart guys... They let Haidéu getaway. And Leca... The same old story about Leca and Haidéu. About money to fund electoral campaigns. Give me something new! In Oradea, it wasn't just about corruption. It's a complex system involving the SRI, the police, customs officials, the Finance Ministry. This goes deep. I have some SRI reports, testimonials, intercepts. Haidéu isn't smart enough to launder so much money on his own. Worse is that they sacrifloed some kids, 18 or 19 years old, who're now in prison. The companies were in their names and got caught up in Haidau's games. Wait, let me catch up. The SRI were oontrolling and protecting Haidéu's business. He was their man. And yet they were listening to his calls? Why? The SRI isn't a monolith. It's got many arms. Some of them wanted a warrant to bug the prosecutor. The others couldn't stop it. The idea was: “Go ahead, make your wire-tap.“ "We'll son it out later.” Us and them, them and us. What is this shit, Cristi? Fuck it, I'm leaving. A bit more fishing and we're going, right? Tell me what you want from me, or leave out all this X-Files stuff. It's not my thing. Read this. You'll understand. I need you to send it to Leca in Oradea. - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Come on, you're a journalist. Stop complaining. We'd better stay another few minutes. Anything else you want me to transmit? What's up? WhY are you so jumpy? What is it? What happened? We had a power cut at 8, and then I fell asleep. - I heard a noise earlier, and then... - What noise? I thought it was you. I must have been imagining things. It wasn't me. Maybe it's better I sleep here this evening. You might need something before the power oomes back on. I'm fine, I'll manage. Good night. Good night. He'! - Hey. I managed to catch you! - Fancy a tea? There's a new cafe... - Now'? I really don't have time. Sorry to turn up like this. I wanted to ask you something. You know about military things. How long would it take to get a gun permit? When did you get this idea? I've been thinking about it for a while. Didn't I say'? What is it Cristian? Has something happened? No. - Is this about... - No. It's nothing to do with it. I was just thinking, ifs good to take precautions. Get a dog. Come on, tell me. Has something happened? No. Nothing. Mrs Minister? Professor! Cristi, I'm sorry, I've something urgent at the Ministry. Professor, just a minute, please. Just a minute. Professor! - Hey- - Hey- So nioe of you to remember. I called you 5 times! Leave it out. I've had a lot on. - When are you leaving? - In 15 minutes. What? What now'? Want a painkiller? Or some hot tea? We need to speak, Dora. It's really bad. Can't you cancel this trip? Where the hell is it? You're always off somewhere! Don't take it out on me, please. You really want to know where I'm going? I couldn't carry on and watch you destroy yourself. I'd have gone crazy. What's this? A vitamin tablet. Cristi, I found a guy who worked with Haidéu. I knew he wanted to talk, because he'd been ripped off, but over the phone he wouldn't... Tell me it's not true! Tell me you've not got involved in this! I know your hands are tied. But if we can find out who's behind this... We're doing no such thing! You're not leaving this house, or speaking to anyone! Forget all about this case! - Forget it? - Forget it! Should I forget about you? Forget that you've not been OK for days? Forget that you're fading before my eyes and I can't do a thing about it? Dora, perhaps you want your big break in joumalism, but... I know what all this goes back to. And this guy is willing to talk. And say what? Pm shoe when have you cared'? Why this sudden interest? Did someone put you up to it? How many of you are there? Tell me! You're not going anywhere! Tell me who put you up to this! You have no idea what they're capable ofl You're crazy! Look at me! Trust me! Finally! Hello. Shall we grab a beer? Come on. How's things? You OK'? Still on holiday'? Have you booked your spa weekend yet? Very funny. So. How did it go? Did you do what I asked? I sorted it. The customer is always right! I asked a friend to join us. So we don't get bored. I think you've already met. He had some business in Bucharest... Meeting some friends of yours. Something urgent. - Thanks for the... - Don't mention it. Come on, are we getting a beer? Sorry. I have to go. Good moming. Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't my group in 204? You need to see the dean. They said you wanted me to take over your lectures. Why? I don't know. Good morning. Your ID please. I don't have it with me. But I work here. In Special Investigations. My name is Panduru. Let me see... You're not listed here. Because I'm on holiday. Please understand, I've just started here. I'll have to make sure. I'll call your section. There's a man here... Cristian Panduru. I see. OK, fine. I'm sorry, but they didn't give permission. This is absurd, I've worked here for a year and a half. I see. But those are the rules. Incredible. Can I make a call? Go ahead. What's up? They won't let me in. It's the chief prosecutor probably. I told you not to get involved in this bullshit. Get involved? I did my job, that's all. Listen, Cristi. I've only got another week here. I'll call you after that and we'll have a chat. What did they do with the case? They gave it to Vlad Popa. He works with Mrs. Penescu. That was predictable. It'll all be OK. See you. Hello. Hi. What is it? What's up? Your Mum will end up six feet under, that's what's up. She shouldn't be climbing in the barn at her age. The ladder broke under her. She escaped with a twisted ankle. Lucky devil! She'll follow your father, soon enough. God rest his soul. But I fixed the new ladder in place when I was there. Yes? Good evening. I heard you paid us a visit? Why didn't you say? I'm not in the mood for this kind of thing. Listen. I think it'd be a good idea to meet up. Yeah? Come on. See you at my plaoe. They are my kids... Matei. Hello! Hello! Maria. Hello... What's your name? Cristi. Maria. Dad, can I go and watch TV? Again') Please? Goon They're the only thing that matters. When you have kids yourself, those crazy ideas of yours will quickly vanish. I used to waste my time chasing shadows, too. When you've got mouths to feed, there's no time for making a fuss about things, or acting like a Smart Alec... So I should forget about the truth, right? Stop being so melodramatic. What truth? You “fink Leads bang backed by a bunch oi nuns'? You think he was waging war against the mayor and everyone else, all on his own? And if his guys get in, you think they'll raise a statue to you? The whole country saw you harassing him in his own home! You go jumping the gun... I don't care who's at the top, who's at the bottom, who's coming and who's going... or who's with him and who's against him... I see! You're above it all! You know full well that the investigation didn't lead anywhere. The witnesses mixed up their statements, no evidence was found. I don't want to be the fall guy here. Tell me something... Why me? Finally, a good question! Let's ask why you, a youngster, should suddenly beoome a big shot at the Prosecutors' Office? A smart, ambitious boy from the countryside... There're plenty of kids like you. Perhaps you seemed smarter and more ambitious. My wife. - Hello. - Hello. - Cristian Panduru. -Andreea, pleased to meet you. I brought you a few snacks. Go on, help yourself. Let's see what we have here. "Bachelor's Degree“ A remarkable student. Worthy of attention. You had good grades. Look here! You enjoyed yourself at university... You liked a drink, too... Lorenzo Lamas. Another fighter for justice. 'Partially fallen arches on the left foot'. You missed the Police Academy. Medical records You'd have been better off staying there. But you have demonstrated many skills. A case against a judge, a case against a parliamentary deputy... What about deputy Antoniu's case? Forget him. He'd fallen out of favour with his bosses. Nobody needed him. It was small time stuff, he was ratted on. Of course, none of this detracts from your qualities. You were hot blooded. A young man. Always on form. Inventive, I might say. That's what I was like, too, when I was younger. I'd fuck anything that moved. And there was something else. You had a taste for finer things. Fucking big ambitions. The only bad thing, you were lodging with a relative. And you thought you could... No, no. Don't bring me into this. That's too much. I just wanted to ask you, like a son. When you decided to take a stand, you thought you could move mountains, right? But you didn't change a thing. What did you achieve? You're not the crusader you think you are. And there are no angels in this wofld. Let's watch a film. Come on, you'll like it. A blockbuster. Come on. You remember'? You and your colleagues, the whole gang at lonutfs stag party. Course, you know what happened next. I didn't think you could be so violent. It frightened me. You know what my godfather told me? He was a former oolonel in the secret police (Securitate). Retired in 1990. 'Ever heard of the Indian rope trick?' he asked me. Apparently, their hierarchy was organised like an Indian rope trick. When the boss at the top disappears, the person below him climbs up to take his place. That's how life works. That's how it works here, too. My God, child, what's wrong with you?... I'll make you some soup. You're all burning up. At least have some tea... I brought you an aspirin as well. I think you should talk to your boss, Mr Codrea. He's not a bad person. He really cam for you. How oome you know about Codrea? He called here. I mean upstairs, my place, on the land line. He wanted to know how you were feeling. He seemed really worried. What did you tell him? I told him I was sad to see you like this. That you're a good kid. And that you care about your job. I said it'd be a shame if he didn't take you back... He said he just wants you to get better, and go back... Why didn't you tell me? - Why didn't you say he called? - I knew you'd get upset. When you get something into your head... And he said that you need rest, that you're exhausted. He's right. You've stopped eating, stopped talking. And you said all those things to him? What did he say? He was so touched, that... That...'.7 He came over. Well, upstairs, anyway. He said his sister was a doctor. He said you should see her, and get something to calm you down. Did you leave him alone in the room? What are you doing? What are you doing, child? What have you done! Don't you realize what he could've left? It's only me. Sorry, Auntie... It's OK. We'll speak when you calm down. A guy is waiting for you upstairs. Vlad Popa. He says you're colleagues. I left him in the living room, I didn't want to send him down here. Shall I say to oorne back later? It's OK, I'll oome up. Hi. How are you feeling? I won't keep you long. The thing is... They gave me your case. Leca's case. I heard. No. Not Leca's case. I mean, they gave me that, too. But I meant the case in which you're being investigated. Me? For stealing documents. It's not looking good. Prosecutor Codrea was a witness, he tried to stop you. There's another charge: accepting bribes. Bribes? The investigation has only just started, but... We both know this is absurd. But you go carry on. When we finish with this, you'll find something else. And so on. It'll never end. It's an investigation, - Not a verdict. - Sure. I didn't want to get involved, you know. I wanted you to hear it from me. The General Prosecutor told me to get stuck into the case. I wanted to stay out, but it was impossible. You know how these things work. It's OK. Hello! - How is he? Did you give him something'? - He's better now. I should tell you that we're buying the apartment. I couldn't wait any longer! Which one? The one with the big patio. - You said you liked it. - Yes. I had to give them an answer today, otherwise someone else would have got it. - I barely have enough money for... - I talked to my folks. They'll sell my apartment and my dad will give me the rest. We'll paint it, change the parquet, insulate the walls, bring some Rattan furniture, plant some shrubs, and get an inflatable pool. I saw one on special offer. In a month, we'll have our house-warming party! Really? Yeah. We'll have our own place, we won't be always on the move. So it's all planned out for me? What if I don't want to'? Who will you replace me with? I'll go down to the store. Your aunt asked me to pick up some groceries. Now the whole world revolves around you! It's like you're the Pope or something! Can you get me some grapefruit? Hello? Hey! What a surprise! What's up? I'm fine. I tried to call. You? I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine. You? Lessons from moming till evening. Nothing interesting. You've been off the radar. You weren't even at school. What's up? - Cristi? - I'm sending you a kiss. Bye. Say something! I want to start again, from scratch. I'll go back to university, I'll start writing. I've already made a start. It'll be OK. He was a cultured young man. Extremely well prepared. He had a perfect grip on the letter of the law. He displayed a rectitude you seldom see, and had a powerful personality. He refused to be influenced or swayed in any way. For him, his job as a prosecutor was his life's calling. It sounds rather exaggerated, but for him, it was true. He was a fighter for the idea of truth and justice. Cristian was a model prosecutor from the next generation. He was respectful and modest, and dressed impeccably each and every day. He was extremely sure about everything he did, and full of self-confidence. He had a bright future ahead of him, and was on the threshold of starting a family. He lived comfortably and wanted for nothing. God rest his soul. Inspired by real events. In memory of prosecutor Cristian Panait (1973-2002) In 1990, Securitaie became the Romanian Intelligence Services (SRI) Atter 1990, SRI officers coordinated special operations to generate substantial funds. Either for their secret service superiors, or for politicians. In Romania in 2002, there were 7 secret service agencies. SIPA, the Justice Ministry's secret servioe, was run by ex-Securitate generals, and was suspected of being a political polioe. In 2006 it was shut down, on the grounds that the Justice Ministry didn't need a secret service. In 2012, Adrian Nastase, Prime Minister from 2000-2004, was sentenced to 2 years in prison for oorruption. In January 2014, this was followed by a different 4-year sentence for bribery and extortion. He was paroled in July 2014. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that Rodica Sténoiu, former Justice Minister, had collaborated with the Securitate. Her code-name was “Sanda... Between 2002-2008, prosecutor Alexandru Lele, who had investigated Panait, was himself put on trial many times. Finally, he was found not guilty. He retired in 2010. On 10April 2002, prosecutor Cristian Panait oommitted suicide at the age of 29. The investigation into his death was closed 4 months later. The possible motives for suicide were never investigated. The rooftop used in the film is the same one that Panait jumped from. Between 2006-2012, 23 members of parliament, 15 government ministers, over 100 mayors and more than 50 magistrates were sentenced on corruption charges. WHY ME?
