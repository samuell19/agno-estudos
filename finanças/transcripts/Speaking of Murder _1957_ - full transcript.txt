La Vie financi?re, please. Thanks. Hullo, is that the police? There's a holdup happening on the Rue de la Grange aux Belles. Louis, we better ditch the car. Louis, not there, eh. Get onto the sidewalk, f' Chrissake Are you gonna shut up? Do we split now? Hang on. Why? Wait for the others. OK, P?pito, open 'em up. Count it. 15 million. How does that divvy up? 3 million each. 3 each? Not more. We gotta pay the guy who fixed the job. But not a whole share. Yeah. That was the agreement with the guy. I'll take it to him this afternoon. How can we be sure of that? You're the only one who knows him. What are you getting at? So you don't trust my word? You're forgetting I'm the one who sets up the jobs. I'm taking the most risk. The guy has never seen you, while I... if he squeals... You could also chicken out and talk. You were shitting yourself in the car. Take that back, Raymond, or... Fr?do, I swear you have all the nerve of an old woman. Is this a stick-up? Whadda you wanna say? Don't get mad with me. It must be stress... or nerves...like you say. No, P?pito. No. You dare... pull a gun on us! This time we'll give you a break. Raymond, you go along to help with the payment. You bet! Else he just might think about screwing us. Beat it. We're getting behind. For tonight, it still stands? Yeah, at the bar as usual. Whadda you think of Fr?do? That's what. I couldn't risk letting you bump off someone who'd stuck his neck out for us. And it's the first time he's cracked. You'd probably come unstuck if you had all his money. Come off it! You going to your hotel? I'd better swing past the 'van. I haven't seen the kids in a month. I should give them some money. Say hi to your wife for me. Come for a bite some evening. Dolor?s'll do us a sheep's head. You off to the track, this afternoon? Oh... shit! What's up? I was given a sure thing for the fourth race. I'll go to the 'van after. Rubbish. Drop by the caravan first and leave a little moolah. Divvy up soon, right ? The deal's still on? Fr?do's not gonna spill his guts? He's too fond of dough to do that. He'll come...trust him. See you. OK. Hey! tell me.... Would that be your winner? This is crazy! Someone's stolen my scarf! We'll find it for you. I hope so. It's the new style fom Herm?s. There's the boss. You can tell him. What's going on? Someone's stolen madame's check scarf. You're going to say it's not true. I'll deal with it. I've told you not to forget things in the car. I assure you that it was there yesterday. I'll pay for another one. Are you dining with me tonight? No. I've got a meeting. Not with another woman? Yes. An infant. Anyway, see you tomorrow. You want me to wear my blue dress? I've had a new slip made. Don't let that get stolen. She's not bad, eh? I'm admiring your garage. You may. It cost me enough. The pneumatic hoist, same cost as my appartment. It wasn't fenced? I needed to modernise a bit. Between the brickies and the plumbers, that's where it all goes. It's not going badly over there. You want to see the accounts. Not now. I'm on my way to the bar Come along. It's a bit heavy, but correct. We'll see. Like you say, it's heavy. I couldn't let myself be rushed by the Maltese. He wanted to buy the land It would have looked good. 2 nightclubs side by side. Talk about competition. Here we're the kings of the sticks. Now we can expand. What are we looking for for this work? 2.5 million pesos. Where do you want me to take it? Last time in Caracas I gave you 10. Wait a sec. The main thing, is that you agree. This is money for jam. This is good for your friend Fredo. That old rascal, it must be 10 years since I saw him. As mean as ever? He won't end up poor. Always the miser. And his floozy? Nowadays his floozy is a respectable lady: Shack in the suburbs, slippers by the fire, mass on Sundays. You know the type? She's certainly changed. In the past, she wasn't such a bad-mouth. As you get older you whitewash yourself. A christening? No, a bit of a party. You gotta stay...you can see your old pal, You'll find he's changed. Once upon a time, a veritable lion. I think your lion has lost his mane. How many bottles have you put on ice? These here. And there are others. 'Evening all. This is all I got to bring back. Hi, Linotte. The American! How's it going? Salut, Antoine. So you had your beard trimmed? I was robbed. Bonsoir, Fr?do. - I'm happy to see you. Payday, eh?. You haven't changed. Just a bit of a stomach. When he came to New York every time a Yank spoke, he asked me: "What did he say ?" Old scoundrel. Excuse me a minute. See you all later. It's done. I took the guy his dough. Good-oh! I'm gonna check out the kitchen. Set a place for me. I'm invited. Antoine, there needs to be flowers here. We do have florists. You were forgetting I'm with a lady? Fr?do... There, Grenouille, go and find us some flowers. 10 thou'? Flowers are expensive in winter. Bonsoir, maman. Bonsoir, Louis. Bonsoir, madame Fr?do. Hortense! We're not getting any younger...eh? Delighted to see you again. Bonsoir, madame Fr?do. I'll be damned...it's Hortense! You're right. Madame Fr?do, my homages. May I present... Madame "Whats-her-name", and madame... Monsieur P?pito, manners, please!. Dinner is served, ladies. Mme Fr?do will place the table. Louis, on my left, Z? on my right, and Madame opposite me. Well I never! It was dusty. You'll need to do your housework. Voil?, my beauty. Don't be backward, take the biggest ones. This is not Maxim's! You're not in the back of a truck either, monsieur P?pito. Fr?do, tell your broad to clam up. Don't answer that. Leave it alone. Mademoiselle, the lemon, please. Louis, pass me a little butter. You haven't tried sea-urchins, Antoine? It's no time to be outside. Grenouille, go and draw the curtains. You too, sweetie. - Who's serving the drinks? Hervieux. -Who is it? It's me, H?l?ne. Open the door. Oh, it's you! You're soaking wet. What have you been up to? It wasn't very wise to come here. I haven't seen you for 2 months. Not there...you'll stain my floor. Then go and have a wash...you're all muddy. It's not my fault I've been slaving in the workshop. I've been at it for a while now. In six months I'll be living in Paris with a cleaner job. I think of you, you know. I've already put aside 30 thousand for your coat. "30000"... I won't be getting the astrakhan I spotted in a hurry Wouldn't you rather golden-sheepskin? It'd make you look young. Turn off the light. We make a good couple. Don't worry my darling. Our worries will soon be over. I'll quit nights and be able to spoil you a bit more. I'm going to join with my brother in his garage. Nothing'll keep us apart. I'll move in here. Whadda you thinking? About what you're saying. You're right. I think the golden-sheepskin would suit me better. H?l?ne, wake up. It's six o'clock...my train's at 7. I gotta hurry. Don't leave me alone too long without me hearing from you. You don't need to get up, darling. I've got to close the door. There, monsieur. He's here. Hey there! Whadda you doing? Take it easy, Pierre Bertain. Quietly. You want to go to HQ sir? No. Go to the nearest station. Half an hour to go til we're relieved. You been whooping it up all night! Shuddup. Good morning gentlemen. This is for us? See y'all later. Siddown. So, you're hoofing it around Paris without permission? You know the penalty? Infraction of your parole restrictions: 2 or 3 months. I was on my way to go back by the 7 o'clock train. Gimme a break. Lemme keep going. 2 or 3 months? More. Especially if there are false papers. Have you got your area restriction passbook? Good, that's it. He's OK on that side. Let's see what's in there. - Not bad at all! - You didn't have a boring night! We'll prepare your deposition sheet. There are no forms here, in this dump. It's not a good idea to let this slide. If he wasn't such an idiot, he could get back to her. But as we see, that's not possible. The guy'll be pulled in at the depot. Of course, but... But what? Dunno... he might be given a permit to move around. With a police assistance pass. That's right, sir. With one of those, he could circulate freely. I didn't think of that. Did you here that? That you can walk out of here free? "Free"? Just that, free. And even better, free to remain in Paris. Are you just trying to wind me up? That's not very nice. Why would you let me go? What do I have to do? Oh, nothing, nothing, nothing. Just give us 1 or 2 tips. You should be well acquainted with a few thieves? You've perhaps heard talk about a successful job. or something along those lines. At Lagny, I didn't go to bars where crims meet . But who said anything about Lagny? We're after stuff from Paris and Montmartre. Your brother's friends, for example We're not after stuff on your brother, we know he's sweet. The ones we're interested in are his friends. If you say the word, we'll sign a piece of paper, and in 15 minutes, you'll be home with your doll. You can stay there. No need to return to Lagny. Isn't that a great program? I've nothing to tell you. If that's the way you want it. Ok sign this. He'll take the 11 o'clock wagon. Come on. Sign here. You're not a bit daft? Don't you want to be released I can tell you nothing, I know nothing. If you come back to Paris, you know my conditions. To get me, phone HQ. Turbigo 9200. Extension 907. Ask for officer Pluvier. Get in there. Move it, you too. You going to keep me long? The superintendent will decide. You wanna 'nother bowl ... wake you up? Yeah. You seem out of sorts. With the life you lead... I heard you come in. The clock said 5. I was out on a bender with friends. Nightclub mania... y' know how it is. Haven't you had enough, of that din? You know, in the 50 years I've been here... Just say the word and I'll buy you a house in the country. At least you'll be peaceful. You've put all your money into your garage. There's some left for me. It's always there for you. I ask myself just how you do it. That's about business, that is. Your brother had "business", too. You know what that led to! He can't even live here any more. Don't bring this up with me. 13 months in the can and 5 years stick for some tires... But I have some well-placed friends who are gonna try and have his ban lifted. You think they can? I hope so. It's a question of dough. If they succeed, I'll have him in my garage garage. To stop the stuff-ups. Exactly, he wrote me. He'd like to see that happen. Will you take me along? You expecting someone? Who's there? Pierre Bertain has given me a message for his mother. Come in. Who is it? A faggot, maman. A what? Pierrot has sent us a faggot. Curious way of announcing me. Your from Lagny? Why "Lagny"? Where have you seen my brother? Just at the police station. Had he been arrested? Yes. He takes the 11am wagon. Then? This morning he was taken to a security cell. I want you to know that I am victim of a miscarriage of justice. Last night I found myself near a public convenience, the police have conclu... And my brother? Your brother asked me to warn you: He was sent to the depot. Where did they pick him up? Near Avenue Bolivar. Good. I'm grateful. Au revoir, madame. Take it. I was just doing a favor. Take it. You can buy yourself a new handbag. Au revoir. Thanks. Buck up, Maman. They'll watch him a fortnight...a month at the most. What was he doing up to at Avenue Bolivar? How would I know? I've got it! H?l?ne! Still with that piece of....? I forbad him see her, the little jerk! Louis! I'd like to know what she's up to! I should go. I'm late. Cl?mence will be waiting for me. That kid! That kid! Bye, big-boy. Don't you worry, eh. Bonjour, Louis. A pack of Chesterfields? Cheers, Louis. Gimme some change, Maurice. That's for 100 balls. Have one, B?bert? I've given up. You're right, it stunts your growth. Hey, you're gonna blow all your dough on that contraption Here, have a game on me. Thanks, Louis. It's not for seeing girls with. What do take me for? But one like your brother's... That'd be freaky. You better believe it. 'bye, boys. Cheerio. Get your oranges! They're beautiful! Oranges, oranges! Buy my oranges, they're so good! 'Til this evening, maman. See you then. 'bye Cl?mence. Beautiful oranges! Buy my oranges! Who wants oranges? Finest oranges! Is that OK, sir? Thanks. Do you need to know someone long before accepting an invitation? I'm leaving Paris tomorrow. I'd like to take you to lunch. It'd be a change for me from a business lunch. Don't you trust me? Yes. So what's stopping you? I've got a date. Is he young? Yes. Handsome? Yes. Is he rich? His father is. Who are the chocolates for? The gentlemen opposite. Here you are, monsieur. Put them there. Excuse me. What do I owe you? 6000 francs, monsieur. Keep the change. Merci, monsieur. Is there no way at all to arrange this lunch? The thing is, he'll be waiting for me in his car. Like every Wednesday. And if I should have a word with this young man? There, my sweet, your tip. It's a green car. Fine. With the manicure, 1500. You've struck it lucky. It doesn't happen to me. He's so distinguished. Pardon, monsieur. I'm a friend of H?l?ne's. She won't be able to have lunch with you today, she's lunching with me. She would have warned me. I arrived unexpectedly. She'll tell me herself. She's asked me to let you know. What are you getting at? That you should beat it. And at full speed. Whadda you mean? but, monsieur... I'm not your "sieur". He was charming. How about lunch at the Cascade? Fine. You don't live in Paris? No, I'm just here 2 days a month. What do you do exactly? I'm in business. How about we take a bit of a walk to work up an appetite? OK? OK. They're lucky to be able to do that. I would have loved to do horse-riding. Have you done it? Yes, in the artillery. You have a pretty laugh. I don't often get a chance to be happy. But with you I feel good. Are you cold? A bit. You don't have a fur? Not yet. But I think I'm going to get one. But I'm tossing up between an astrakan and a golden-sheepskin. In your place I wouldn't hesitate. I'd get a mink. Apart from the youngster in the car, anyone else? No. A woman always needs a man to help her. But to find one, one I'd want... You slut! You've never heard of Pierre Bertain? He's made enough mistakes, without a whore like you. I forbid you to see him again, you understand? I forbid you! You did say Industrial and Commercial Bank, one Pug 203, blue panelvan body? Armored? No. Number 8021 BA 78, leaves Dourdan at 2pm towards ?tampes. You're sure they'll go past there? Sure. Are they sweet peas? In 2 months they'll be up here. I treat mine with compost. You're doing right, there. On the whole you gain with that. We'll see. The cost isn't the same. The cost shouldn't stop you. And still we talk about the high life. If we're stuck we can always fence a few gold coins. That'd be painful. They've gone up 40 points. If I'd heard about it I would have bought Suez Canal. I'd be fixed for winter. Suez, OK. But phosphates? Have you seen how much they are? 27,000. I thought you paid 30 for them. Didn't you tell me that? Whose been kidding you? I never said that It's not something to joke about. Did you get a flat? Yes. Thorn, stone... I dunno. What's going on with Toto? It's easier to manage amateurs here than at the Melbourne Games. There, they've got it! Oh, to be young again. Come through here, maman. You'll have the usual. A Malaga for my mother and two small Ricards. We'll lunch at a bistro I know. I'll get a table. You've got news from H?l?ne? No. She hasn't replied to my letters. Perhaps she hasn't had time. She would've been able to give me some sign of life. You can always find time to write. And she doesn't work Mondays. We'll be there in 20 minutes. Thanks. After lunch we'll get you some new duds. Sound good? I thought we'd be going to the garage. We'll go to the garage afterwards . Look at him. He sees himself in a collar and tie already . Cheers! Happy now? And how! Wish I was there. I've got a surprise. I've made your favorite dish for tonight. Beef stew? I've got a business dinner this evening. I've a client. Of course, my son. Maman, if Louis's not coming, you know what I'd like? You want me to dine alone? Ah well, off you go. I'll tell him you've gone dancing. Au revoir, H?l?ne. Rock'n'roll's fab. My feet go wild. Cha-cha's better. It's more exciting. Au revoir. Au revoir. Thursday, then? She's not bad. You're talking about Prince Charming. Jacques, you'll get jealous! Can I come up? I don't want to find myself in the Bois de Boulogne woods. Whadda you mean? Ask your brother. Bravo! The romance didn't last long, Jacques! Your chances are coming back. Bonsoir, monsieur. Sleep well. Have fun! Au revoir. Yesterday Mimile phoned Fredo. Some heavies are driving with the loot. We'll have to take the risk. You take the risk if there's no other way. Why's it brought forward? They don't want to keep the money in the bank over the holiday. They say it's not a good idea. Otherwise nothing's changed? No. Except that it's for tomorrow. That's it... The delivery van'll leave Dourdan at 2pm. What the hell are you doing here? I thought you'd gone dancing. You hear me? So answer. You've heard what was said? No, Louis. I was taking a nap. Louis... Take it from me, P?pito. You'll see, you're wrong. That's true isn't it? I still don't know what you're talking about. Keep cool. 'Til tomorrow. Don't forget to warn The Sailor. Pierre, You have heard, haven't you? No, no. Pierre... Swear to me you'll speak to no one. But I haven't heard anything. Swear, I'm telling you. I swear it, Louis. On what? On our mother's head. What? That I will speak to no one. Good. Why did you come back so early? I gave you enough to play with. I wasn't in the mood. You wanted to see H?l?ne again. You've been to see that slag? I won't have you call her that. And what's the story about the Bois de Boulogne woods? Because your mother hasn't told you H?l?ne was less than nothing? Answer my question! I forbid you to chase after that screwed up...! Louis! Have you no shame? Your little brother? Louis! Are you crazy? Scram, bikes are coming. Come on, Raymond. We'll have to fix them, now. Bravo, Raymond. The other one. You see, Louis? Whadda you waiting for? Raymond! Fr?do, your go, go on! Piece of shit! Don't! In half an hour we'll be at the hideout. Hang in there. The bullet holes will make us obvious. We'll need new wheels. There's a farm. Don't shoot, you shit! Stop, you arsehole! We gotta torch the wagon. His helmet saved his life. And the first man? He'll make it. Oh! You alone? Mimile had a nose for it. The 60 seem to be there. What's he up to, Fr?do? Have you ever seen him miss the split, that one? When I think what he made us today. We'll split The Sailor's share That'll make half a mill times three. But surely not a full share for Fr?do? For that shit. For the last time, I'll be straight with him. You want to send him packing? No. I'm starting to admit failure. I've decided to stop. Whadda 'bout me? You can find another gang. Whatta you gonna do? Take a trip. "Travelling"? Yep. I wonder what a new life can give. What are you doing there? Your golden-sheepskin. That's nice. Come in. Put it on the table. Quickly...open it. Thank you. Help me put it on. I wanna know, about the Bois de Boulogne woods. Haven't had an answer. Don't raise that ever again. Pass me my scarf. With this coat... H?l?ne... What happened? Nothing. He came to invite me out, supposedly to speak about you. We were close by the Cascade restaurant... It was nothing. No, go on. Just that, nothing. He made some... propositions. He got fresh, then I slapped him. Is that all it was that he refused to tell me? Take it easy. We won't talk about it. Go sit down. I'll just be a minute. It really suits me you know. I'd like to keep it for... Hullo? Yes, it's me. He's certainly not here. I thought he was with you. He hasn't gone home. When your nerves crack, you can expect anything. Maybe he's hiding in a corner somewhere D'you think he's going to forget ... this? We gotta know where he's been. If we can't find out, we go to his place. OK. We'll meet downstairs at my place at 9 o'clock. Nine o'clock? What's the matter with you? You're cold. Are you sick? No. You're keeping something from me. Tell me what it is. Nothing.... promise. What is it? I swear...you're imagining things. If you can't trust me, it's pointless you staying here. You can get out then. Pierre! Darling, tell me what's making you so unhappy. H?l?ne, if you knew... H?l?ne, it was my brother who pulled the Dourdan job. They robbed a bank and killed two guys. Freeze! You seen le Blond? We were to meet at 9. Don't bother waiting. The cops hauled him off. Oh, Mi-Fa-Sol! I'm gonna need you. OK...I've got a run to do. I'll explain in the car. OK. You'll soon be able to sign. "Sign"? I'm innocent. You think I'm guilty? A burglar, me? You're kidding. But you admitted tonight... Mind you don't get a stroke. Well, we'll see. Be sensible. You're going to make a mistake. Sign here as you promised. What...! Did I say that? Well? You going to stuff us around for long Speak up!... you hear me? We know everything. We know who sold you out. So ask them. We're tougher than you. And you'll fold, I guarantee. Raoul, bring in you know what. So... what do you think of that? Pretty, eh? I told you we're the hard men. Give in! And tell us where to find The Gypsy. You're making us waste time. Out with it! Take a photo. It's part of the loot. It was found at his place. His mother's here. She followed us. She hopes to see him. No way. She seems prepared to wait. Let her wait. Here's another headache for you. You're done for. Come on, admit it. The jury'll give you a break. Stop it. I've no idea what you're talking about. If you tell us where The Gypsy is, you'll be better off. Word of honor. - You're dummer than I thought. But you'll come round. Look who's in my office. Out here! What'd I tell you? Happy to see your old friend? i don't know this guy. You can stop your performance. Who were you with at Dourdan? I'm waiting. With Raymond, The Gypsy... and Louis. Who gave you the job? ?mile, who runs a bar on the Dourdan road. 10 million was for him. Who hit the motorcyclists? The Gypsy and The Sailor. Who decided to throw The Sailor out onto the road? Louis. Who stuck up the bank? We did. Who came here to HQ this morning? Who asked to see me? Who fingered the whole gang? I didn't want to, Louis. I had to. I was scared, scared, scared. Can you understand? I was at my wit's end. I was terrified of you, The Gypsy, the cops, everybody. You gotta understand! I had to! Too much killing! Too much killing! Too much killing, I tell you. Too much killing! Too much killing! You can finish this puppet show. I've never seen him. As you wish, but you're not going anywhere. When Emile's here we'll see what you deny, C'mon boys...lunch. And give the photo of The Gypsy to the press. We gotta move quickly... he's a killer. Get up. Hook him up. Let's hit the chow. Good-oh! Send in a man to guard him. Toss me my coat, I'm cold. Enjoy your lunch. Will you bring me a snack? You can starve, scumbag. You got a butt, chief? I'll pay you back. I'll sign.... Or maybe not. Don't take your eyes off this smart alec. Understood, chief. What do you prefer? Pat? or sausage-loaf? Whatever you like. You have my full confidence. We haven't worked together for a while. I like night shift. Not for me. - I got used to it during the war. War teaches you nothing. How? I made it through the last one. That's nothing. - Did you join the force straight away? No... I tried other things I couldn't get a job on the subway. Me neither. - I wasn't qualified for the civil service. Then there was my wife, Paris meant nothing to her. - She's changed her mind? You know how it is. Her uncle had lodgings at the Bastille. When she came and saw all the cinemas and stuff, she was hooked. - It's like that, with country girls. Parents? No. I need a "hit and miss". What? I need a piss. Hurry up. It takes time. Just a minute. Go pay the taxidriver, Grenouille. Just a smidgen more. Leave it there. I've gotta catch The Gypsy. Anyway, if you should see him before me, tell him it wasn't my brother who squealed. Put everybody wise to that. You need lolly? Yeah. How much? A 100 thou, OK? - You need anything else? A piece. Ciao, Antoine, and thanks for everything. Ciao. B?bert! Where's Le Blond's brother? I left him downstairs at his babe's place. He wanted to see her. Bolivar Place, 5 or 6. I'll see if he's in. Hang on, here he is. B?bert, Louis on the 'phone. It's you, B?bert? Yes. I must find my brother. Go up to our place. Tell him to lock himself in and answer the door to no-one. No-one, understand. Tell me, have you seen The Gypsy? I haven't been able to find him. The Gypsy's looking for your brother, too. I gave him Helene's address. What? Is Pierre there? Yes... Louis? I'll be back. Listen, P?pito... It wasn't him who squealed. Give us another one. Don't you interfere! Don't open. I told you... You crazy piece of shit. Your brother heard nothin'? Speak up, scum! He heard nothin' did he, the other night. Piece of shit! The slugs are for your brother, but you're goin' anyway. Go... you scum. Through there up the stairs. Come on! This way. Subtitles: FatPlank
