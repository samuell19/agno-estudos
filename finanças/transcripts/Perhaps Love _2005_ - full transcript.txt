Life is like a film Each of us is the lead in our own film Some might assume he is also the co-lead in someone else's film But in fact, his role is merely supporting Or just a bit part Or worse... his scenes could have been edited out He just doesn't know it Like the mother and child here The girl will certainly be the lead in her mother's film Yet, in ten years How important would the role of the mother be in her daughter's film? I'm responsible for keeping track of these deleted footages I make sure they are intact Because people do make mistakes in editing all the time When they realize they made the wrong cut... I'd deliver the footages back to them The destination of my next delivery is here The time is now The set is done The studio is lit The door is open Costumes' been chosen Vocals' been sweetened Rhythm' been enlivened All ready and waiting Shoot-the past and present Shoot-love and pain Shoot-tangled rivalries All are nothing, but an illusion No less than a blink No more than an eternity It's heaven nevertheless How close is the present how distant are the memories? How stressful is the past how tiring is the present? "In a world where love's forgotten can a memory be born to last?" What kind of a love story can pay for your living? Who would allow this story the highest glory? Perhaps all love stories do not come easy But they're just words on a blackboard such is the irony Wipe away the past and present Wipe away love and pain Wipe away the rivalries All are nothing, but an illusion No less than a blink No more than an eternity What kind of heaven is that? Oh, this love story Forget this love story Hold onto this love story Oh this love story Forget this love story Hold onto this love story How close is the present how distant are the memories? How stressful is the past how tiring is the present? "In a world where love's forgotten can a memory be born to last?" How close is the present how distant are the memories? How stressful is the past how tiring is the present? "In a world where love's forgotten can a memory be born to last?" Or fade like a picture on a silver screen Cut Cut! Slate... Clap-board! Do we have a take? Is lunch ready? Let's break now Meal break! Mr. Nie! Wanna be an actress? Meet the director! How's it going? The love amongst the leads is way too artificial What do you mean? She read your script yesterday and cried so many times - Didn't you? - Oh yes... It was so moving! You hear that? So moving! Xiao-yu is not exactly in love with Zhang Yang Zhang neither... he reunites with her for other reasons As for the circus master and Xiao-yu... what they have is hardly love If so... This is not a love story then! Xiao-yu and Zhang have to be in love with each other The circus master has to love Xiao-yu and vice versa There, we have a love story which is exactly what I've promised to deliver - You must make me a love story! - Love story is silly Love story is... that's not the point! The point is, women dig love stories The audience digs love stories! Do you like love stories? - Oh, yes... - Good girl! You see?! No kisses, no nudity and no love scene! Where am I? - All in the contract... Shanghai, on the way to the hotel press conference Hey! I must get the cheque before the conference starts Otherwise, we're not getting out of the limo Okay, bye How long did I sleep? 15 minutes That's all? You called and woke me up again last night And said something about revenge and getting even I said that?! Next time you take sleeping pills go straight to bed! Whenever you don't, you go crazy! Why are we taking this film? You're missing all the offers in Hong Kong! I'm out of here as soon as the press conference ends! You'll be on your own Just don't ring me up every other night Look, your actress Don't you dare fall for her during the shoot She's an opportunist But she won't go for someone like you She only digs directors What "memoir"? I only agree to do a photo book But Miss Sun Your success story can inspire our youth If they were as poor as I was as a child... They don't need to be inspired to succeed Oh, that's good! "If they were as poor as I was..." What are you doing? You heard me "No memoir" Time to go, Miss Sun The only value of my past is to remind me to stay away from it Is that clear? What if one day you really forget it all? Wouldn't it be a pity?! That'd be perfect What about love? There is no such thing as love! Miss Sun... Hey Chief! The contract should be fine with just a couple of changes Such as this word, you know no one is comfortable with it And this clause... Never mind! I'll just rewrite the cheque One more thing! Why is it written in past tense? Never mind! I'll just take a zero off the cheque But it's not something from the past We'll talk later The press conference is starting - But the present tense suits the artist better... - Later... - The artist needs that... - Get lost! Rumors say that this time the finance drives the project And it's your Hong Kong investor... ...who insists on a musical and casting a star from Hong Kong Does it mark the end of Nie Wen as an auteur? How do you think of... I've never had more than one option which is to make good movies Finance, cast, genre whatever are simply means towards my end Sun Na This is your first collaboration with Lin Jian-dong What's your favorite movie of his? You won't believe it I've not seen any of his films - I seldom watch Hong Kong films - Are there love scenes? Wouldn't Mr. Nie be jealous? Sun Na, have you closed the deal on the Hollywood picture yet? Not yet Will you be using a dance-double? If you don't start to ask more intelligent questions I suppose I can end my Q & A session right here! You've been avoiding making films in China What makes you change your mind? Good paycheck, a great director And a gorgeous leading lady! Well said, indeed! And a great movie in the making will eventually answer it all Let's learn more about its plot from the director now This is a story about a love triangle Sun Na stars as Xiao-yu She had lost her memory She'd forgotten her lover She became homeless And then... one day She met a circus master He took her in and made up a beautiful memory for her Good evening, mister Mister? Hurry, Xiao-yu! But at this time, her former lover shows up He's Zhang Yang It was you, no doubt... your voice, your back The distant look in your eyes puts me to silence Are you testing me because you doubt me? Perhaps my memory is flawed You aren't you after all Who are you then? Someone who has forgotten her love for me? My heart is enthralled by you, broken by you I regret nothing even if I should Love that once existed, or perhaps it was only my illusion How could you forget it all... Forget all about me? Who are you? Who's this person gazing at me? Is it deja vu, or is it a dream? I seem to have known you before The love in your eyes is a feeling I don't understand Why do you have to ask me... ...ask me who I am? Have I really forgotten... ...who I really am? I did know you, didn't I? Look The camera loves him But who are you? Sun Na The pressure is on you now! You lost your focus here Your performance was unstable You're just picking on me! Take it easy It's only a rehearsal shoot We've been through this every time After editing you'll always give us a pleasant surprise Does it mean I should get you to edit my next Hollywood film? Practice your English first Your deal is not even signed Remember Mr. Gu's party is the day after tomorrow He has promised to invest in my next film I have to study the script and stay "focused" Where do I find time to entertain your investors? Jian-dong's gaze is good but there is too much anger Got to tone him down... Mention this when you meet Mr. Gu Our musical deserves a bigger budget for promotion Who's going to be your PR once I'm gone to Hollywood? Good evening, Mr. Nie, Miss Sun Nie Zhang's agent called me just now He read the script and... He realized the circus master is not the lead So he's not interested He'll change his mind in a couple of days! But he's already negotiating another picture deal! He won't turn me down If he does, I can do it! I was an actor once It was Nie who made Zhang a star Get real, you guys! No one needs to repay a favor with the rest of his life! Who are you then? Someone who has forgotten her love for me? "I hate you..." "I hate you..." The check, please! Hey! Can I take a shower at your place? ...spectacular The world out there is so forlorn While you're enjoying the world out there I'll be here wishing you the best Sorry, I took your carton of instant noodles... - Monkey Miss Sun It's been a long time! Oh, you are...? Don't you remember? Back then when you were a showgirl in Sanlitun I saw your performance! Your troupe leader Song was my buddy You're mistaken I've never been to Sanlitun Hsian Ping, you're an assistant director now! You gonna be a director next You make it sound like a curse! Jian-dong, my handsome man Hsian Ping can make you a star! Damn right! Let's make a toast to our future big shot director! Stop jinxing me! Just drink up! I could hardly recognize you You come here often? No A classmate of mine got hired as an assistant director We came here to celebrate So you're in film school Yep Is it fun to make movies? Hey, what's your real name? Call me Monkey! My last name is Sun same as the mythical Monkey King - And you've come to Beijing to... - Sing! Who's going to be my audience in the village? And you? An aspiring actor? An aspiring director! So "Hongkonger", I still owe you noodles We'll meet again for sure! Embarrassing, wasn't it? You don't recognize the guy but you do know the song, right? I'd like to take a rest if you don't mind You were so cute in those days We've never met Never Knock it off! You're driving too slow! I'm sorry, ma'am! So who was this girl I met ten years ago? A ghost? Whatever Who you thought you met never existed Ghost or not... You know what scares me most? ...is that she never loved me Then I've been a fool for ten years Stop the car! Miss Sun! Lin Jian-dong! I looked for you in the dorm But they said you've moved out When did you come back?! Just now! And I came for you right away! I'm going back to Hong Kong next week You've graduated? Nah... I... I'm dropping out What about directing? I don't have the talent... I can't pretend How do you know you don't have talent? Do you have to raise your voice? I mean, it's not like you've made a few films already How do you know you aren't talented? Didn't you quit already? What are the books for? For the library! And I'll submit my resignation! Hey! Monkey, I'm not like you... invincible! I do fall apart sometimes, you just don't see it! There's no fun if everything comes easy I blew all my money on the shoot... even next term's tuition fee Just come stay with me! I'm getting by! I can take care of you! It's your turn to owe me something The troupe is disbanded No way! Such is life! Nothing is certain! I might be a movie star the next time you bump into me! You want to be an actress? A pub, at most, can only fit 100 people But a single theatre can fit a few hundred! Who would not want to be a movie star? C'mon in! Watch your head! This ceiling is fine for me as long as I don't grow taller I'm stocked up with goods here and that means extra income If you tidy up the place sometimes that would pay your rent An art director is still a director, I suppose Still, I'm a bit disappointed I was counting on you to make me a star once you become "the director" I was kidding! If you're determined to be a star You can make it You think so? Because you're invincible Quite true Let's drink to that! Good! We'll drink to that! A long, long time ago You belonged to me; I belonged to you A long, long time ago You left me to explore the world out there The world out there is so spectacular The world out there is so forlorn While you're enjoying the world out there I'll be here wishing you the best A long, long time ago You left me to explore the world out there The world out there is so spectacular Zhang Yang reunites with Xiao-yu in the circus Bad news: She's become amnesiac! And worse... The circus master has already won her over... ...by providing her beautiful stories of her past Once upon a time, he had a love story Days of romance and youth A sweet story to tell Xiao-yu... that was your name! We grew up together Once upon a time they were childhood sweethearts His charm, her affection... ...inspiring envy Then one day the girl lost her memory A beginning hard to forget An ending hard to remember Enough! I'm happy as I am! A loss so tragic, where truth lies Not knowing, a blessing in disguise The boy with a beautiful memory The girl without a past, a mystery Monkey Are you happy? What's your trick? How can you always remain happy? Do you remember? I used to hold you just like this Once upon a time, he had a sad story Without a happy ending he won't surrender Passion burns to shine, a brief history Irony of fate, why hold onto misery? Forget this love story come what may Why not drink and dream your sorrows away? Remembering changes nothing anyway Will knowing the past begin a new day? Once upon a time, I had a love story I wonder, was it real... ...or fantasy? Cut Cut! That's it for today! - Mr. Nie... - We'll continue tomorrow We still haven't got the circus master... who do we shoot with tomorrow? I'll be the circus master! Mr. Nie Hot and sour noodles Thanks Remember your first movie? It was shot right here! You came here for my noodles everyday! You gulped it down fast every time Yes! I was always hungry in those days What happens to my appetite now? You used to say, the sooner you finish a film... ...the faster you prove yourself a good director Am I still a good director? Stay asleep, in the dream within a dream From this day on, no more doubts All I'm asking is a word from your heart Say you loved me... all along That will be all, just say no more Because... you do love me Perhaps... you do love me I'm enjoying this more and more! I had a long chat with Zhang Ji this afternoon For old times' sake He promised to ditch the other deal to do the role of the circus master It's too tiring for you to direct and act as well! What is it? Am I not big enough? With Zhang, you can recoup a couple more millions in European sales Why bother being an actor? Zhang taught you that? You taught me that Would you care so much about me if I hadn't made you a star? If my film sucks... - Will anyone care about me? - Nie Wen! Enough! I'm not your child! "Nie Wen", "Nie Wen"...Iong before you became Sun Na, I'd already made Nie Wen! When is the shoot? Can I visit? Deal! It's the day after tomorrow! Is the film going to be shown in America? Yes, of course! The American producer also said... ...don't know if he's serious though... ...that he'll marry me A paper marriage! Otherwise who would marry a fifty-year-old?! He's probably teasing me He knows I want to go to America Is that what you want? Of course! All film people dream of going to Hollywood! Who's going to watch the films made here? He also said that I'm petite... only a head shorter than average... But in America, I'd be three heads shorter! That would make me very special! And much easier to visit you in Hong Kong with an American passport! Don't look... It's a wonderful world out there If I go out, how will I fare? The world out there has so much to share I can be free if only I dare I can't see the present in my despair Out there I'll see what my future will bear The choice is not easy, I just can't compare Blow out a candle make a wish with this breath of air It's a wonderful world out there I'll find love and someone to care Out there where there're chances to spare I'll learn who I am, in the world so rare Neither of us is going anywhere... You aren't going to America I'm not returning to Hong Kong Where's the director? Nobody's coming; just you and me What do you want? Stop bothering me Fine I won't bother you anymore if you take a trip to Beijing with me Why Beijing? You'll see Why do I need to see what I saw 10 years ago? You're the one that don't get it Look at you You failed to become a director and then dropped out as an art director, but look! You've become a star! You moved on! So why keep pulling me back?! I'm taking you to see Monkey! I am Monkey! No, you're not! Monkey loved me! Let's get married For ten years I've been dreaming the same dream... ...every night It's gone as soon as I open my eyes Sleeping terrifies me Because in my dream... In my dream... I'd suffer over and over again I'd lose you over and over again You know how that feels? You think you can cheat on me? I know everything! I say nothing My eyes are watching Yet you assume that I feel nothing Without me, there wouldn't be you What the hell is he anyway? To love is to possess Men are born to be jealous Love clouded my heart Love blinded my eyes I'll risk everything to make you mine Go tell him Say it to his face Say that you love me, not him Because, you do love me It's a wrap! There are these men... ...who resort to cruelty when betrayed by their lovers But it's not about vengeance On the contrary, it's love The circus master belongs to this type and that's why he hits Xiao-yu That would set her free And set him free The truth is... To hate someone is much more painful than being hated It's not hatred that drove him into hitting Xiao-yu What he did was to let go of his right to hate her Hitting her would make them even When did you change the script? You didn't tell me This morning So? Do you like the change? I do When will you ever say... you don't? Be honest for once and say... "Nie Wen, you're finished!" - The script discussion is over! - Let's talk about us then I said, discussion is over! Come with me... Come with me... Come with me... Come with me! Got no love Got no hate Can't catch it Can't trash it Xiao-yu... There are no faces of angels Though these faces can bedazzle The misery outside our windows We're all just ants in the ghetto Got no rights to cry for sorrow Hunger lies in our pool When's your wedding? Love is our only tool I'll be in Russia till the end of the year... just don't get married too soon! - You're shooting in Russia? - Yes! - So he's your assistant director buddy - Yes! He's the one The world rests in the gutter What's the point to fear and shudder? Agony never lasts an eternity Heaven and hell in total unity - Hurry with the prop guns! - Okay! Go on in! Hsian is in there ...then we cut here The distance between you and I Passes by in a blink of an eye As we stand at the crossroad We all leave behind our shadows Don't fight it, just go with it The world rests in the gutter What's the point to fear and shudder? Agony never lasts an eternity Heaven and hell in total unity The world rests in the gutter What's the point to fear and shudder? Agony never lasts an eternity Heaven and hell in total unity Got no love Got no hate Can't catch it Can't trash it Got no love... Got no hate... Can't catch it... Can't trash it... Got no love! Got no hate! Can't catch it! Can't trash it! The world rests in the gutter What's the point to fear and shudder? Agony never lasts an eternity Heaven and hell in total unity The sexiest appeal The easiest deal The sweetest battle The coolest game of the jungle Forget those days... Forget them Forget me The sexiest appeal The easiest deal The sweetest battle The coolest game of the jungle These are all my savings Should be enough for a ticket back to Hong Kong Donkey Remember... The one who loves you most is always yourself When will you come back? In three months, I suppose But you know what filming is like... I might end up staying another month Let's meet up afterwards then Aren't you going back to Hong Kong? You aren't waiting for her, are you? She's coming along with me for this shoot She says... She wants to get into acting so I've got her a part in the movie She's... ...really with your director? She's with me Disappeared? Mr. Nie is gone... They say Mr. Nie has quit! Are they shutting down the production? He'll be gone for only a few days The Producer said so That's all I know! What's going on exactly? Is he actually coming back? How is the budget doing without Nie? How much are we losing for every idle day? What is the cash flow right now? Boy! You know an awful lot man! Let's go to Beijing! Many developers are interested in this property It took me a lot of effort to keep this place 19-Dec-95 You didn't come back! Monkey Where are you? Come home! Every time I came here I recorded what went on in my mind I thought I'd feel better in a year's time But I remain the same How could time pass so slowly? November, 1996 It's been 2 years already... You're back finally Can you come back for once? Just once... I promise I won't make you stay You'll be free to go, okay? December, 1997 I think I've recovered I don't feel as bad this time The bed here still brings up memories But they don't sting that much now I sat there... And I smiled So it isn't that hard to forget you 3-Oct-98 Are you dead? If not, why don't you come back?! You're so vain! I don't want to see you ever again! Go to hell! I hate you! 31-Dec-99 I've become an actor! Don't tease me! Perhaps we'll work together one day 6-Dec-01 How are you? It's snowing outside Mr. Nie! Let me get your key So you're up! Wish I were here to witness this I've waited 10 years for this moment You were holding me tight last night You must be thinking that I'm everything to you Since when have you become so naive?! It was you who'd said... "The person who love you most is always yourself" Know what I regret most in my life? I fell in love with someone I despised And I ended up despising myself! You've made me despise myself for the rest of my life Last night was a hoax But those tapes are real I'll always keep them Because I know... I won't be able to talk like that ever again Returning to Shanghai, Mr. Lin? 2 tickets... where's the other passenger? Hear that... you're crying See that... I'm leaving Now that you understand my grief Keep the sadness as long as you breathe Loving you was not a mistake Hating you was no salvation I don't care anymore about memories Let's just end all our miseries Perhaps it's love... but it's not blissful I know that better than you do I want you to shed your tears To say that perhaps we can start over But I shall say... "No" Don't go in We still have one more scene to do The closer you are, the further you seem What's deep in my heart is what I can't say Passion and desire, coming and going I thought you understood Do you hate me, or do you love me? What's stopping you from leaving me? Truth or lies, I take them all As long as you love me Happiness and grief, they come in pairs I'm bewitched by you, you're bewildered by me Stay asleep, in the dream within a dream From this day on, no more doubts All I'm asking is a word from your heart Say you've loved me... all along That will be all, say no more Because... you do love me Perhaps... you do love me Nie Wen... I thought I wouldn't hear you calling me like this again Back then, you needed a director I needed a companion After your first film... ...I expected our relationship to end Yet, we've made one film after another We've been together for years now Probably longer than we deserved I've been rewriting the script in the last few days Tomorrow... We'll shoot our last scene Let's end it well Once the scene is done you're no longer Xiao-yu Step by step, a choice is made Line by line, questions are answered Fates overlapping, plots intertwining A labyrinth with no way out The moon is full, a wish fulfilled a perfect ending The moon is clouded, a wish wasted a twist of fate I swing over, but I miss your path Forget about our past choices Let go of our lifelong tormoil - Forget, forget not - Intertwining, devastating - It's gone, it's not gone - A puppet of fate with a solid faith - Leaving behind this love story - Too easy to hold on, too late to regret - Too hard to turn back - Let it go - Too hard to move on - Let it go My role gives me no choice I am standing on the edge I take a deep breath I'm not your freedom The cloud above is calling at me For you, I'll embrace my destiny Let go! Let me be your memory! Sun Na! I've finally realized our love story... A love story I'll never be able to forget I'm finally entitled to my beautiful memories Swing here, swing there; never ever forgotten Thank you everyone! It's a wrap! Thank you to all! Mr. Nie, you're hungry! Very What are you thinking? Your next film? Before I became a director I'd always wanted to make a very simple love story Don't know why It never happened; I even forgot the story Forgot? But today, it suddenly came back to me The story takes place in Qingdao About a young couple Starting with a crane shot from high above... Tracking in slowly and the couple comes into view They're sitting on a green pasture behind them is the deep blue sea That's Qingdao That's it, Qingdao Coffee please How about noodles? Did you finish your part? I think I did... I think I did Everyone wants to find out Who's the one love of their lives? More so melancholy especially around midnight Eyes closed with heart unsettled Because deep inside, you know that was love Monkey I'm leaving Don't forget Beijing Never Remember? Your Memoir Last night... An old friend told me a story... I was touched It takes place in Qingdao... but he forgot the ending I remember that story It's a movie he always wanted to make It begins on a bright summer day There's this green pasture At the end of it is a salt lake He keeps getting the places mixed up It's "Qinghai", not Qingdao There are no salt lakes in Qingdao If this story is to be shot one day It's got to be Qinghai Start in the summer and wrap in winter I always wanted to be in that picture Even with pain, even with tears... Even with countless lonely nights Love... why is it always clearer looking back? Even with pain, even with tears... The feeling remained after love was long gone Perhaps such was love Because such is love
