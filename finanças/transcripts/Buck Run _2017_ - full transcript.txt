Shh... Did we get it? - We did it! - Hey! Turn around... Look at the camera! Hey, hey, hey... wait! Wait... Tots? Beans? Okay. Shaw. Didn't you notice? - Yeah... - You're acting different. You alright, man? No. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy! Mom? Ma'am! Prominence Bank. I need your attention. Your attention please. Carl, sit down. Mary-Alice, turn around. Your attention! Eyes up here. Those of you that will be missing school next week... ...to go hunting, need to have this permission slip form signed, and returned to me... tomorrow afternoon at the very latest. Those that don't return their forms... Shaw. Shaw! Hey. You fell asleep. ...all of your classroom work, and homework... must be completed. Hey, come on, move! Hey! Stop! Hey! I'm sorry... Uh... yeah. Yeah, this is William Templeton. Oh... Take your time. I'll be right outside. There any other surviving family members? Well, my mom... Shaw's grandmom. She, uh... lives in Erie. I haven't talked to her in years. Her choice, not mine. What kinda relationship do you have with Shaw? Well after Karen and I got separated... she didn't want me around, so I didn't see him much. You mind me askin' the reason for the separation? Didn't get along was the main reason. Then I had a drinkin' problem, that didn't help any. Still have a drinkin' problem? Two and a half years, clean and sober. Never felt better. I'm gonna have to be frank with you. I'm concerned... about Shaw's welfare. A 15-year-old boy found his mother's body... and was alone with it for a day and a half. Now, I don't know if you wanna, you know... pair him up with a therapist or something, I don't know. Alright... We're gonna release you now, okay? Yeah? Alright. Go home and get some sleep. Go ahead. Hey... You wanna talk about it? Can if you want. ...very evil stuff. And I got... enraged. I looked at him as a man... ...as a scumbag, as an enemy of humanity, and all my genetics said, that's the enemy. And so I wanted to come on air and really tell you what I thinkabout it. I don't... because he's a predator! You remember Patton? Well, he's big now. Who's that? Who's that? I don't think he remembers you. Hey! Hey! Can you help me with this? Where do you want it? I don't know... Over here. Over here. No. Actually... let's go over here. Just set it here for now. What's it for? Well, this is just for a little while, until... You expect me to sleep on it? Well, it's not that bad. You know, just, uh... No. What... are you worried about this? Yeah. It's just a water stain. I'm gonna put the sheet over it. You won't even know it's there. Then you sleep on it. Well, this is your bed. No. I'm not doing it. I'm not sleeping on this shitty cot, in this shitty house. I'm not doing it. It's what we've got, alright? You're gonna have to deal with it. What are you, tough? What? You're some kind of a bad-ass? Is that it? I didn't have to keep you. Okay? I can give you back anytime I want. As long as you stay under this roof, you treat me with respect. So check that shitty attitude right at the door. Or I'll end it. Right fucking now. You got it? Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Sleep well? Did you get a haircut? No. Handsome boy. Thank you. Dad. Dad! I need to get some stuff from mom's house. What time is it? Um, I don't know. Flea market opens in a couple hours... Why do you have my phone? I'm sorry, is this your phone? You pay the bill for it? Hm? Come on, come on, I need it. Well if you don't pay the bill, it's not really your phone, is it? Don't forget to look in the truck! My main strategy for finding big bucks is to hunt the does. ...locate where the does are feeding and bedding during the rut. If there are good bucks in the area, it's just a matter of putting in your time to get a look at one. I'd scouted a ton. So I was ready... What are you doing? Setting up, Walt. - You do not have this stall reserved. -Now hang on, hang on. It's my bad. Alright? Are we cool? Huh? Are we good? Go on. Fucking degenerate. Thank you, Walter. When are we gonna have a funeral for mom? I haven't thought that far ahead. Lot to do. Shouldn't we be making arrangements? You got cigarettes? Can't put my life on hold just 'cause... You got a light? Just 'cause a few things change, you know? We're gonna have a funeral though, right? Hey! Take a walk. Go on. Where? Go on. - Is that Shaw? - Yeah. Thought he didn't visit with you no more. Well, he does now. Oh, man. So he's gonna live with you now? I don't know... I mean, I hadn't talked to her for... for months. Except once. I guess it just... snuck up on her. Man, I'm sorry. But... I guess it's good at least you divorced her. I mean, well, think about it. You'd be stuck with all her debt... and you don't owe her anything anymore. Right? Maybe you'll finally take off that damn ring. Hey! What are you doing here, faggot? Yeah, go around him. Shaw! Shaw! Hey! Yeah. Grab his cigarettes. What's your problem, asshole? Why so fucking rude? Get the fuck off me! Stop! Stop! - Give them back, you stupid hick! - Settle down! Hey, hey, hey... Hillbilly piece of shit. Whoa, what's the problem here, killer? - Stop! - Dad! Is that Shaw? Let me go! You calm? I didn't do anything. What's going on? These fucking rednecks jumped me. This your boy, Will? Yeah. Keep him on a leash, will ya? You let that little faggot get the best of you? Here. Did we get it? I don't know. Your dad got right on him. I'll be damned. How many points you got? Shaw! Take what you need, I don't have all day! I'm up. Okay. What does it say? Dad! Dad. Is it about mom's funeral? Yeah. Four grand for a casket. - You with the family? - Um... - The wake's not till five... - I'm here about my mom? Karen Templeton? Did you come by yourself? You're gonna need an adult... - Yeah, but I can... - You gotta get an adult. - No, I can... - Come back with your father. But my mom is here, right? You gotta talk to your father about that. I can't help you. Sorry! - That it? - Yeah. Hey! Shaw! What? What're you doing? Nothing. What's that? It's not mine. You got more of 'em? No. Hey, keep lying to me, see what happens. Where'd you get these? Stole 'em from my dad. - How's everything at home? - Sucks, what do you think? Your dad treatin' you alright? No. He's an asshole. Alright. The funeral director called us 'cause you been out here. So... Don't hang out here no more. Like Santa. Yeah. I'm Santa. You want a present? - Yeah, I do. I deserve it. - Yeah? Are you here by yourself? Will. She loves me. John. She's a whore. Just sayin'. I don't give a shit. Are you in, or not? No... I don't know. Come on. Come on! I can't! Come on, I... It's too much! What? What? What's with you? No, no, no. What's with you? Me? Yeah, you're acting weird and you know it, right? You're acting weird. Oooooo... Oh, what the... Jesus. It's $250 for both at once. Uh, no. One at a time. I ain't got that kinda money. I'll cover you, pay me back later. I can't. John! Come on, it's not like your ex is gonna find out. I don't wanna do this. What are you... this is gonna be good for you. - I'm doing this for you. - Who's up first? - Let's just leave. - Go around. We ain't goin' nowhere. Watch out. Here. Alright. You're up. No... Already paid. I don't care. You're full of shit. Did you... Did you ever even get a divorce? It's true, isn't it? You're still married. You're a bad fucking liar. So what happened to that money I lent you? Fuck. You said... You told me you needed a few grand to buy Karen out, so you wouldn't have to pay alimony. Shit! There we go. Fuck that shit! Pass that back, please. Hey, Robbie. Hey, Robbie. - Little shit. - Stop! Faggot. Get out of my way. Why? I don't have time for your bullshit. Move! Get the fuck out of my way! Give me your wallet. Huh? Get the fuck off me! I'll kill you. Gimme your wallet. - No. - Gimme your fucking wallet. No, get the... get off me! Hand 'em out, boy. Shaw! Hey, hey! Shaw. Hey, uh... I'm sorry about your mom. I gotta go. Robbie! Oh. Bye! - Give me my wallet. - No. Just give it to me! Give me my wallet! Hey, what's going on? Let his wallet alone! Give me my wallet! Fuck you. Fuck you! Get outta here! Mom, I'm back! Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom... What should I do? You need to... You gotta get up. I... I gotta go to school. I'll be back, mom! Okay... Shaw... didn't you notice? You're acting different. You alright, man? Jesus! All our stuff is gone! What's going on? I'm selling the house. No! ...deal with you...! What about my bike? Fuck! I'm tired of your shit. I'm takin' you back. ...whoever has the CIA's archives can take advantage the whole... ...CIA open, and hack into your personal things... But think about the people that use iPhones, in the business world. Does it make you feel safe that the people that... organize our infrastructure... our business secrets, our technology secrets, our military secrets, our political secrets, finance secrets... They use iPhones. They use Windows. They use Google Android... Is it okay... you know, maybe it's not okay that the CIA... and other people can spy on you in your private moments. But what about the people that... Hey! Shaw! I guess I'm the stupid one, right? So, uh... You ever gonna answer my question? My money? What did you do with it? Sorry, John. That's no answer. Five thousand dollars. I didn't know what to do. She was gonna lose the house, John. Thought you were my friend. Is Robbie home? Dear God... Bless this, the food of thy servants. For holy art thou, now and forever... unto the ages of ages. Holy spirit, as this food feeds our bodies, so we pray you would nourish our souls. Amen. Amen. How are you, son? Fine. You like it? Yeah. It's good. I heard what happened to your mother. She... is with the angels now. I kill the chickens. He killed the chicken in the soup. We raise 'em. On the farm. - Oh, I have your homework. - After dinner. She's smiling down on you. You know, she's smiling down. I... I... I don't know. Do I make you feel uncomfortable? No, sir. Wanna play? Come on, you gotta block it. Yeah, there you go. Come on. Blocked it. Whoa. Well, looks like you beat me... uh, well... I lost count but I'm pretty sure I had one, and you had, like... ten... twenty, 100, you know. Yeah. Fuck. Dad. Dad? Dad! What... what? Dad! Dad? Dad? Please... Dad... Shaw... You think I'm a shitty father. Don't you? I had, uh... I had a word with the funeral home. Why'd you do that? Well, I sold all that, uh... Army surplus stuff, we had in the shed. I didn't get a lot for it, but... it should be enough... ...to cover a small ceremony. It's just... me and you. How soon? I was thinking the day after tomorrow? I'll... call 'em in the morning. You have church clothes? Yeah. Somewhere. Dad. Mm? Cliff keeps messing with me. Look, just don't go to the Penn Mart for a couple of days. I'll talk to Dan. I'll get it straightened out, don't worry about it. Good morning, Mr. Templeton. Mornin'. Please, come in. Shaw! Shit. I gotta talk to you. I gotta tell you something. Shaw. Yeah? Yeah. What are ya doin'? You asleep? Yes. Okay... Talk in the morning? Hello? Hello? Hey, Will. Hey, John. What's up? I was just thinking, uh... I don't know what happened. I overreacted, I guess. I don't know what to say. I fucked up. I don't blame ya for bein' pissed. John? Don't worry about it. I was, uh, thinkin' about heading out, you know it's real nice out, not too cold. No... no. I gotta be with Shaw today. If we go now we'll be back before breakfast. Come on. You up for it? Dad! Dad? Dad! I gotta go. Head back the same way? Up there. Are you the grandson? That's not my mom. That's Mrs. Oliver. That's... that's not my mom. Her funeral's today. Where is she? Is everything all right, Mr. Davis? Everything is fine, thank you. You'd better go out to the car, they'll be expecting you. Yes, sir. I'm Alan Davis, the funeral director. What's your name? Shaw Templeton. Well, Mr.Templeton, if you would join me in my office, I think we can straighten this out. Now, Mr. Templeton. You're William's son, is that correct? Yes. Did your father come with you? I don't know where he is. He told you there was a funeral today? Mr. Templeton came in yesterday wanting to arrange a funeral. I quoted him our prices. He did not have enough money. He decided to cremate Mrs. Templeton's remains. I have them in the next room. Can I see? Of course. No, I'm afraid Mr. Templeton is the only person who can claim Mrs. Templeton's remains. I'm sorry for your loss. Give... Give me the fucking urn. Okay... It's my mom. Fuck you. Kevin! - Stop him! - Fuck... Hey! Stop! Fuck... Shit... Hey, sorry. I meant to... What? ...bring the horse blankets, bundle up... You'll be glad you did... ...brief shot of winter coming our way. Here's that cold front now making eastward progress. A couple rain showers up ahead and just behind it. Could see some snow showers across Western Pennsylvania... It's okay?
