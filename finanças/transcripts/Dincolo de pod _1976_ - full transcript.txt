BEYOND THE BRIDGE ADAPTATION OF THE NOVEL "MARA" BY IOAN SLAVICI IN A FAIR OF TRANSYLVANIA, 1835 We weigh first, and then we sent the cards away. Don't put the beef there. Throw it on the scales. Come on! Come on , come on! Let two more people come here. So fast.. Yes, I have so few things. I also packed them. You can come back anytime, Sida. And most importantly, tell your mother that by working, you have completed the price of your staying here. She was always afraid of that... of money. Mother Aegidia... the charity seal. Amen. Yes.. Your school is over. When you came, I had just finished my novitiate. and your mother was so scared that... you won't be able to learn here. Sida! It's not just inappropriate for this place! It's inappropriate even for you. The windows were made so that it could not be seen from the outside, not from the inside. How can such a beautiful man stand among those bloody flesh? It seems more important to me that he does not lose his beauty, wherever he goes with it. And I think you've been watching him for too long. And that will make him think about things they he wouldn't otherwise have in mind. It's a sin in its own way, Sida, the one you did with this man. Because you may never see each other again. Who knows? Maybe we'll see each other again. Seeing each other again, everything that now, in this moment and in some others, will seem sublime, it will have unbelievable appearances, painful, like a kind of living death. But I don't believe anything about him. I just looked at him. Maybe it's not the best example. Look, is that woman still in the yard? Yes. And what it's the similarity between me and Reghina? I was just thinking. She is also a woman who had moments of revelation. Human, of course. Here's how she came to live her dream... She went too far. Damn the wind! Give me those papers too! Bring them here! That's nothing, in the morning it was going to pick us up! We still must wait long? We announce our honored clientele the diligence for 2 o'clock... Do you know where Mara's shop is? Take the suitcase and take it there. Not over there. Around here. The road is longer. It's okay, I'll give you more! Who is this girl? I do not know. This is Mara's daughter, Sida. How big she is. She will look like his mother. Fierce woman! How are you, Bandi? Look, with mom. Pull closer. It's not hot, but it works. It's full, take it. Sari, since when do you load? For a long time! Hei, you, don't throw like that! So far, I've released four carriages. Good. Give me the shovel. And don't crush them like that! Nobody takes them like that! Look, don't step on it because it's falling apart! Make way. Give it a go, give it a go! You need to load faster. Come on, hurry up! Be careful not to fall apart! You loaded it? Come on, go up with it, what are you waiting for! They all go to Liubicek. All four. Yes, we go to Liubicek We take as much as we can. Throw up. There, on top! Sari! Sari! Yes, I'm coming! This one when it's ready, in a week, right? I think so too, maybe faster! Well then... Hurry up! Six carts! Take them to boarding school. To Mr. Coler, do you understand? Now you break it. Is good. That's good. Do you think, all it's so? Yes. It's penetrated. Very good. Good. Okay, you can go. Mara, I'm taking you home! Come on, let them go! We are few! What is this, Sari? They had to be burned by now! Everything had to be burned! Until you return, we're done! Let's go! I'm coming!! Do it so: send them to the boarding school and to Liubicek Six at the boarding school, four at Liubicek You make money, Mara! I make money not only for me, but also for you Come on, don't be silly, If I gain, you gain, too. Yes. Take these money. Take these too, come on! Take it. Choose. The same .. Come on, the money. Take it, boy. Forget it, Mara, I already payed.. Leave it, take it from me, too.Take it, boy. Why did you give him money, too? You remembered when you were young... You were so fierce then! You sold what you could, you bought what you could find, always working! So you can maintain your kids. Mom, did Sida come? She came! She's so beautiful, she's like a young lady. She really is a young lady! There aren't many girls who spent five years with the nuns How many parents can pay so much money? Go and get dressed as Bocioaca is waiting for us. Sida! My daughter! My beautiful daughter! Well, come to the light to see you better. You're really pretty, but you're a little skinny. Mother Aegidia said I could come back whenever I wanted. I could receive the wave of neophyte at any time. To remain her neophyte. You lived among them and got used to their habits. You ve just return home, you didn't see how I arranged your room and you want to leave again? I just wanted to say what I had to say so I wouldn't forget. There would also be the question of money. She said that by embroidering I gathered a large part of what was to be given I knew you would enjoy the news about money. And one more thing... I'm really glad. I'm glad. You don't even know how hard it is for me. I struggle to make ends meet. I'll send Trica to Bocioaca. Disciple. In two or three years he becomes a great master. He'll have his money. Come on, boy. Yes, he will have his money. Well, come on, why are you wondering so? I am wondering how beautiful is Sida. Come on, boy. You think you're escaping, don't you? Go to hell, learn to behave in people's homes! And keep your mouth shut, hear? Come on, boy. It's none of your business. Come on! You have nothing to do with them. The master is coming. What, are you crazy? Hello. It's not always like that, Mara. You can leave your son here. Hello. I know he's good, and I'll make him master when he'll grow up. How much do you ask, boy? Well, I don't know. How much should I ask? The price I deserve. If that's all you need, then go with the others. Find a place to sleep. Let's shake our hands and go. Pass by home, boy. He should get some more stuff. He will have all here. Home, food and .. he will also learn the trade properly. That's what I want. You know better because you are a guildmaster ... I hit him in his mouth so he won't eat for three days. Look, he ripped my shirt.. I'll catch him.. That's it, I'm leaving. It needs patience to do this. I don't have time for that. You always move This way I can't finish it! I don't have time for that, sir. Take a penny from me. Leave me alone. You must wait a few minutes more Boy, take those chests. Hurry up. Diligence! Don't believe Mr. Hertea... Look, I came! Good luck, good luck! Here... The mail to me. Hello. Good luck, good luck. I'm sorry, I had to close the store, but now I'm staying. Please have an imposing but relaxed position. Dear mother... take care of yourself! I will, Mom. Farewell. Next time, bring me more money. To your mayor. Cover them so that the rain does wet it. You tied your luggage tight, didn't you? I recognized you immediately, miss. Mrs. Codreanu and Mr. Hans Hubar. Hello. I took the opportunity to meet you to say goodbye. I'm leaving for a while... out of town. For two years. And where are you going? In Buda, in Vienna .. Who knows where .. I have to make my apprenticeship journey. Otherwise I can't become a foreman. It will be difficult for your mother being without you. I think it will be. Farewell. Goodbye, miss. Hello, Mrs. Mara. This Hubar boy is a bit distracted. I'm leaving. I still have some business to do. It's time to go. Do you want to happen like last time? I noticed you changed your face. Did everyone go up? Your voice was drowned out. and trembling .. You didn't know what to say or what to do. I was scared. Why? How can I not be scared when I find myself like this, suddenly with a man with whom I haven't exchanged a word in my life? and he speaks to me as if we had spent the childhood together? I can't believe you haven't seen or talked before. And how can I convince you that we really don't know each other? No..you've changed your mood.. or maybe you've changed it since he was here. Yes, it is true. Because it seemed sad, like we were splitting up or like I was to blame. Maybe in a way, you're really splitting up. What's up, Mom? You stay with the light on and the shutters drawn? I see that you and Codreanu know each other quite well... You looked well together. Everyone watches you. Yes, yes.. But what about that crazy Hubar? He rushed like a crazy one. Have you known each other since you were little? No. I don't think. They came from Vienna when you were grown up.. I hope you haven't something to do with this one? He rushed like a storm when he saw you in the arms of Codreanu. He seemed crazy. It's not him who is crazy, Mom. It's me. One day the window in the great hall was broken. Not long ago, when I was about to leave the monastery. It would have been better. So what if the window was broken? I sat in the window as long as needed. For him to see me. And to see him, too. He was so beautiful. And he was so unfit among those bleeding flesh. Then, when I got home, instead of going straight, I went around. and I passed before the butcher's shop again. Poor boy... You made him think of you. Otherwise he would not have dared to talk like that. Since the incident with the window he walked by here so many times, to see me, at least. Leave it.. Don't think about it anymore... What will be, will be If you're not made for him, it's his misfortune, not yours. What if I'm made for him, Mom? This can not be. God knows how hard I struggled for you. And He can't punish me so harshly. Sida... if you died I would be deprived of the joy of my life, but I would say that other mothers have suffered too and in the end I would come to terms with the thought. But noone of my people profaned their blood. And that's not all, girl, that you are Romanian and he is German. I know his father well. For years. Make friends with me for a profit and leave me alone when I lose! You're so stupid because this one has twisted your mind! Remember, Sida! No matter how much you love each other, the world will not let you, because you are not the same kind! And if you want to know, he won't be with you forever. I'm sorry for the boy, but you are thr one I care for, and you have to understand that it is not possible. But what are you doing here? Forgive me, my good mother, but I don't know what to do. I'm going back to the monastery. A while. I don't know how to handle the world. Maybe it's better that Hans is gone. For two years. You have your own business, Mom.The commerce. But what should I do? Sit in the window? Of course Codreanu is smart and good, but what should I do here? Should I expect him to ask me for a wife, but shouldn't I love him too? Do I know what to say? You know better. If you think it's better to leave, leave. So soon? Yes. I think I'll stay here for a while. Say, Sida, have you met a man? A man you fell in love with, it's obvious. Isn't he the one in the butcher shop? I told you something then, about you, him, and Reghina. and you contradicted me. Do you want to give him your loneliness? You told me once and I think that's why you came back... that you always feel like lying to your mother without wanting to. that is, you can't tell her everything because she judges differently. Yes, differently. On any matter. And do you think that is a very big difference between the way you get along with your mother and the way you would get along with a man? I don't know. I rarely spoke to men. And they are always embarrassed and somehow funny. And the thought of depending on one of them sometimes makes me laugh. Sometimes it scares me. Hubar! A thief! He also has a gun with him! Go after him, let the people know! What is it, what is it? Come out!Come on, the town is filling with robbers! Last week they attacked Craiova, come on! You're being watched. Karl..hai. Where are you going? Not with us. Go that direction. To the stonework, to surround him. Get away from there, boy. Get away, can't you hear? Hide yourselves! Hubar! Hello. That's almost ready. Is the headman at home? What is it, Mara? Are you scared of Hober's friend and now you'd came for the boy? I didn't come to get him.. I came to send him for Sida because I feel so lonely in the evening. Hello. Marta, call Petrica. Maybe it's true, Mara, but do you think that Sida will stay at home? I also think about my daughter, it's still small, but... she will grow. Who do you want to marry Sida, Mara? I heard she became very beautiful. I don't know.. You are the headman.. I was thinking maybe you could find one of our boys . A craftsman from your guild who could take good care of her. Hello, mother. Trica... go to Sida tomorrow and bring her back. because I feel so lonely.. You don't come home at all... Well, why are you so silent? Or is it hard for you to go after your sister? All right, mother. I will go. I will go tomorrow, for sure. Do so. Bye, mother. To tell you the truth, I am scared since these robberies in the town. They're not robbers, Mara. They know what they are doing. Did your mother come to pick you up? They want to ruin the emperor's order. Keep working outside and wait for me upstairs. They fight for counts, for boyars .. I have something to tell you. And it really needs to be changed .. Just put the table on for the master. We who work to sell his goods, this order is choking us. Listen to me, the boy will be fine when this is over. You know better because you are a headman. Hello. Hello, Mara. You know the recruiting will be done soon. You have to avoid it, boy. Only the stupid ones and the poors get in the army. If they take you, these days.. Your mother could pay for you, she has enough money. She could do something for her son, too. God forbid! No one can get so much out of her. And even if she wanted to give, I don't even accept. You are a fool! Does it bother you that I hold you like this? Why should it bother me? Will no one find out? Never! I'm going to talk to my husband and tell your mother to redeem you. She has money. And even if she has, she won't pay easy. What should we do if they take you in the army? I'm going now. Another time, when we'll be more relaxed. Look here, "To change the order of the Court made for the boyards, for the counts. Those in the guilds, and those who make and sell the goods must make their own laws..." Wait... "Our welfare means the end of the king's old order." His Heighness .. Is that all you found with him? Yes. You had to deliver them before you read them. Please forgive us. It's very good what you did. The riots have multiplied. and their target is the empire. Our great empire. They are organized and dangerous, gentlemen! And their power is not limited to these papers! I read that guilds should... Your guilds are you! Hubar, Liubicek.. and the guilds belong to the empire! Defending them, you defend the empire! So you did well. Everyone like this one must be shot. Herta, we have to bury this man. He wasn't a thief. So, this is the money for the mayor's office and for the boarding school. If you had come to town hall, it would have been better. I would have had the scripts. Well, the scripts. Anyhow, I know. That's the money for town hall and boarding school Much of it is Hubar's. Good evening, ma'am. Come in. No, no, thank you. Is Miss Sida at home? No, she leaved a long time, since the fall. She is at the monastery, at Mother Aegidia. No, she didn't become a nun. She stays there. There you can find her. You know, I haven't been here in a long time. I had to take exams. Now I'm... I mean, I'm going to be ordained. Can I go to see her? Yes, of course you can. You know... I don't mind you... No, I had just finished making some payments. Welcome inside. No, thank you, no. Good evening. Good evening, sir. So... Yes.. I'm looking for Miss Sida. Wait. Good evening. Please leave us alone. We could not talk openly. Be kind and suffer the punishment. Aren't you surprised? No. Not really. I figured, of course, you saw my mother and she sent you here. I was very surprised to hear that you had left home again. I hated the noise and the hustle and bustle of the world. Sit down, please. I longed for the peace of this house. I had, like any woman, needed support. But you are, if I am not mistaken, orthodox. So the support of this house will not be able to last anyway. You will have to leave, to get married. You have a different faith, haven't you? What if the man I chose were of a different faith, could I marry? Yes, I think so. What weird questions you ask! Instead, you didn't ask me why you came. To see me, right? You also came because you didn't know how long I would stay here. I want you to know that for me, the strongest thought for my future , now, is to stay here. I'd be so miserable if I had to leave. In a year or two... I don't know what I will think about it. Who keeps his opinions for two years? Two years.. And what if I asked you to... You know I care a lot about you and I think you care a lot about me, too so you can't ask me to answer you now. Later.. maybe.. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Thank you also for your thought. Do you stop by my mother? No. Reghina? Why do you need a name? Me too, why should I have a name in here? What do you want with my mother, Sida? Do you have something with her? Nothing, Bandi. What could I have? I was just thinking about going home. So, do you take them or not? I would take them. So take them. I'll take them, lady. There are 's good. Hello. Aren't you selling weapons, Mrs. Mara? Weapons? Where should I get weapons from? But who are you? My name is Iuliu Burdea. As for weapons, I was joking, of course, I was trying to talk with you. I'm actually looking for your daughter, Miss Sida. How do you know Miss Sida? I didn't say I knew her, but look for her. I'm looking for her on behalf of Hans Hubar. Sida is at home. Sida! And you are a little unpolite. Reguarding Hans Hubar, he is even more unpolite. Maybe I'm a little unpolite, but very little. Listen, do you know that lunatic Hans Hubar has done? He sent this gentleman only to see you. Good morning, miss. You are exactly as he described you, maybe even more beautiful. Do you remember the morning with the monastery window? But did he really tell you all? And how do you know him? We were classmates. His misfortune is that instead of learning, he had to become a butcher. Hello. Do you want another work of mine? No no. Give me some polish. Chemical. Yes.. So you don't you want a work of mine? I saw him, many years later in Vienna, now, wandering. We read again together different books. More important. Some books that brought us very close, both between us and to an ideal. Different than butchery Quite different. But that's not the point. He was very changed. He talked a lot about you. He knows you love him. Hello. I want to buy some salt, lady. Okay, go and get yourself. I'm leaving, ma'am. Don't hate, you would be committing a sin. Hello, miss. I guess you hate me a little. It doesn't matter. Sarutmana. Strange man this Burdea. He seems to be dealing with hidden things. What are you up to with Hans Hubar, my daughter? I'm a shopkeeper, I don't know how to advise a delicate girl like you, but I'd like to know what you're up to? I don't think Burdea came here for nothing. He came because Hans Hubar came too. Sida.. You didn't want Codreanu. All right, but all you have to do is look around. What, only this one is good for you? The boy of the man who snatches money from me? He may be good, he may be beautiful, but... he's German and you have to understand that's impossible! I got in his way, Mother. I made him a wanderer and a madman! My dear daughter! How much you love him! This is how the guild rules sound: "The one who want to enter the ranks of the masters must have worked two years at a famous master" and that's good! You wandered in Vienna and in Buda!For nothing! Shame! You made fun of me in front of people. Are you a merchant's son? That's how you respect.. I can't! You must understand that I can't! To go out in the market and shout out loud why I wandered instead of sitting and learning the trade? You don't know what's going on in Europe! A movement for world change is being prepared and this wave will get here too. That's why I didn't go to the craftsmen. I know my job. But it's not mine. But what it's else? A woman? That passes quickly. I did it too. So? So what if she's beautiful? Roll with her on the river banks and enjoy yourself as long as you like! But don't get involved! And with who? With one that belongs neither to your people, nor to your rank. It's true, I have companionship with his mother. So, what? Who is Mara in this town? No one. If you want me to stay with you, I must be the first to know! I must be informed by you, not by the others! I see that you know all very well and you don't care that you offend me with your words! Why do you are against Sida? Why isn't she good? Why are you against me? Why didn't you let me in school? As I am, I didn't have to be a butcher! Look, I'm telling you today, I don't feel like cutting meat! Well done, that's it! It's not just that! There is also my pride! And you have it! You don't like cutting meat either! You'd rather talk to smart people than break bones! May my mother live, that the butchery works! Don't you dare be smarter! I'll slap you so that no learning will wipe the traces off of your cheek! I wouldn't advise you! I'm not a child anymore! What are you looking at? Leave us alone! Get away, why are you gathering here? Bandi, I'm sorry about your mother. Where are you living now? Wherever I go. You know, Hans beat up his father, Hubar. He almost killed him. How do you know? I saw it! Okay, go and tell him to come to the abandoned inn. Come on. Okay, I'm leaving. What'up, girl, what did Bandi tell you? He told me that Hans had beaten Hubar, that he almost killed him. Oh my God! People lie, mom. They tell lies. I'm going to find out the truth. He returned and instead of behave well, he beats his father from the first days. Hello. What do you want? Bandi, did you call them? Yes. My dear wanderer, why are you fighting and you are crazy? What should you do now? I could go away again. I have some money. But I think I'll stay here with you. But how is it possible? It will be possible. You think about church, don't you? Not just at church. At Mara, at her ambitions. I'm thinking of yours, at your mother. You lose her like that, you lose her love! And not just hers. I left dreams to become a butcher. I leave them all for you. I don't care what they say. I don't even care about my father. You know that well. Only that you don't love the way I love you. Then why am I here, running away from home? But what can I do? How can I go back to my mother and tell her again that I want you... and I don't want another man? You're not coming back. We'll stay here. The house is Liubicek. We rent it and make it a pub. Even if he wouldn't come here. I don't make my living with the merchands from the city, but with you. Yes Yes. We're staying here now. You don't mean it, but I'm really staying here with you right now. We pay the rent on the spot. Here I will calm down. Far from my parents and far from the city. What about you, Sida? Are you staying with a man who didn't get along not even with his father? It will be different with me. Yes. It will be different. Hans, Sida is calling you. What's the command? Don't talk like that, you won't convince me. Have you calculated the money we lose because your friends eat and drink for free? I did it and it's a lot! Maybe. But not all my friends have to pay. Many of them should be payed by me. Don't you think that the pub would work just as well without you? If not better? Bandi, what are you doing? Don't you ever realize why no one comes here again? Why is everyone avoiding me? They don't want you, that's it! And because your wanderers don't come anymore, you are shouting at me like the lowest man? Understand once and for all , they are not wanderers, they are real people I am the wanderer and the lost one! Don't touch her! You were right, mother! Even if I had killed someone, I wouldn't have suffered so much! I was right. I was right. God drive him crazy! Come on, shut up, shut up, shut up! Come on, baby, shut up! I know it's not over. Why, Sida? Why is all this happening, girl? Because you're so good and beautiful and because, God forgive me, you don't want to break up with that madman. I would have accept anything rather to see you beaten by a man whose love you placed above my love for you. Leave him! Get away from him. That's enough! After all, a girl like you can't be seen often around here. No one has a dowry like yours. As for beauty, all the more. Money, dear one, is great power. He opens all the doors and breaks all the laws. You have money too, Sida. A lot of money. A few thousand or more... Who scared of my money. Tens of thousands. Tens .. It is not in vain that I have worked so hard for so long. Tens of thousands.. All right, but why didn't I know anything? Why didn't you tell me it was so much money? That's why Hans is so upset. Even crazy. I took him out of Huber's fortune and made him an innkeeper. I knew I didn't have a dowry. Or so I knew, that I didn't. And not even your approval to take him as husband. I'm married to him, Mom. I'm going to tell him about the money. About the dowry. Goodbye, Mom. You won't see any money as long as you stay with him. Not even a dime. I will not give you not even what you deserve. Can you hear me? Not even what you deserve. It's like giving back to his father the little money I snatched from them. Sida, in the carriage is a weapon. It has a name written on it. It is not your business. Leave it there and take care of the horses. How why? Ah, were you? I talked to my mother about money. Do you really think that great fortune could make me chase away the thought of being defeated? That's why you came back. And so you will come back every time, until we'll tear each other apart. Don't worry. They don't know Romanian. Her Burdea knows everything, as usual. What he doesn't know is that we may not completely torn apart. You'll hate me again. I don't think she knows exactly if she's a nun or a laic woman. and confuses the life of a laic person with penance. as you, in fact.. In fact, I'm not more stable either. Something between a priest and a soldier. But at least I know that it's worth fighting for our truth If we only speak about it, the truth dies. It must be imposed. I see I'm starting to give speeches. Hans is not the impulsive and tough man you know, ma'am. But not even the one that he wants to be. You know that, Burdea. Your good goes with you or not at all. And I can't. I don't have the strength to come. The proof is that I'm staying here. Stay here. I hope we will start soon and then you will be very useful. If in the meantime you don't become too much of a bartender. I think we should talk in such a way that they understand too... In fact, in its main points, our program is established, as you well know. We have the right and the duty to be a free nation. In Moldova and Muntenia there are connections with workers, with intelectuals. Here, even it is more difficult, only the sign needs to be given. And it will come through me. Join the army! Any man is a soldier! Come and join! In two years they send you home.It's easier now! Get out, if not I'll put the police to follow you! Listen, they gathered! Get up, come on! Did you get up? They took our son the same way, but he ran away twice. Come and enroll. Who went and got used to it.. For the glory of the empire! can go again. For the emperor! Come on, they are here. I'm going too. Fuck the poverty. Recruitment has begun! Come in front. Where are they taking them? The wine they give you kills you, that's it. I have something better. Do you want some? I've been following you for two months. Come on! Come on, get up. Get up, don't you hear? They are all! Let's go. Well, that's what you told me. I say many things... See you another time. Another time... But when? Trica .. What are you doing there? What's the matter? What's the matter with you? I told you you wouldn't want me anymore. Why shouldn't I want you? Because you're fooling arround with that one? If the master could have seen you... Be good, boy, it's nothing. What, am I making love with him? Did I get him out of the army? Come on, Trica... We have time. The master is just gone. Don't you like me anymore now? You know that neither Sida nor your mother had any money. I mean, they wanted to give only a part of it. and with such difficulty. The rest was given by my husband. Who pressed him if not me? Come on! And why didn't you tell me? It might have not suit me. Did you buy me for two years? Trica, what are you doing? Are you crazy? Wait! Trica! Come in the army, heroes! Come, for the glory of the Empire! This is not life for me. I leave them with all their money. Oh, wait, you're a deserter. Stop shooting! I'm coming with you too! He escaped, damn it! Good thing he threw away the bag! Ready! Let's go! Trica!What have you done? Why did you join the army? So much money lost! But maybe it's better this way. Sometimes you want to get rid of something and you can't do it in other way. Good luck, Hans. How are you? Good luck. Tell me when are you going to bring those wheels? Well, I gave them to my brother To whom? I thought he was your brother. The tall one, who walks around here. He looks a lot like you. I gave them to him. Ask him out well. Trica is gone. Yes.. Did you hear what he said about Bandi? Now I realize that he looks like someone. And maybe that's why I loved him so much. This boy came here for you. What do we do with him? I don't know... But it would be good if he didn't find out anything, because I don't know what would come out of it. He loved his mother like crazy. I know him from the monastery. God, what a curse! You were so good to give money to Trica, and he got caught himself. My father struggled for years to see Reghina in the wheelchair and he didn't say a word. That's why he got angry. My mother and I stood in his way. And you came, good and beautiful, to take our curse upon you. I'll tell you again, Bondi mustn't find out. Of course he won't find out. But we have to do something for him Let me try to talk to my father. In the city, merchants, owners and larger guilds bend their ears and even their bags at the words of some rebels, the enemies of the empire and these words create and spread revolts. These rich people want to overthrow the order of the Court, to take the place of the nobility. They want to govern! Did you call me, Your Highness, Prefect? Yes. Pay attention to your surroundings. Don't ignore any person whose name should mean safety and faith. Yes. It seems that together with the young Hubar, the new ideas of him and of those like him who walk around here, entered the city. As I said, the leaders of the guilds are no strangers to the desires of the rebels. Liubicek, even Huber . Tobacco! Wouldn't you like to visit us? Sure. I was really thinking of visit yours. Hello. Hello. I have something for you. How is Burdea? Not really. Okay. Tell him the best. Goodbye. Remember the message you are about to print. "We are on the eve of a life and death battle with absolutism. It is the class revolution that tomorrow will take over the destinies of the world to create a new world, without privileges. The victory depends on all of us. The time has come for us to unite with the country. " Stop it! To the left! Run! I'm covering you! Someone betrayed! What if they found out about us? Ride and return to the city. Hide the papers, hide everything. Announce the ones you can find! Don't go! If not for me... Burdea! luliu Burdea! Now my life it really makes no sense. Aslong as this man existed .. he was doing what I wanted to do. I always wanted to be like him! Maybe that's why I was telling him everything. If I was stronger... stronger than you and this place, I'd would have been with him. Looking for an unknown good which may not even come. Or maybe it would have come or maybe it would have died. Trica! Where did you come from? God, what's wrong with you? Hit it hard, Mr. Hans, hit it hard! Miss, give me that ax. You haven't been to friends in a long time, Hans. No, I haven't seen anyone in a long time. And you never want to see them again? I don't know, maybe. Think about it! Hans, you had a hard day today! Yes, indeed. You grab his horns and tore him apart Gently remove the fat and remove the muscle. We have a very nice nephew. Is he okay now, Maro? Good. They calmed down. My son came home too. It's good. Welcome. Are you still upset, Dad? Now yes. I'm not upset anymore. I brought you a small gift for the little one And for the magnificent woman you were lucky enough to find. Poor her. Do you think it was easy for me? There hasn't been a foreman cut here in ten years. The guild has only two butchers. One me, another Gheorghita. And I'm proud that exists the third one. and that one is my son. Don't worry, Dad. In fact, I told her I could do anything. I'm a man like you. Maybe a little smarter. So I can quietly become a butcher. I'm not going to make you ashamed of me. But I wanted to tell you something else. You have another child whose fate brought him here. You found out! What are you doing with him? Maybe because he looks like you. I paid enough for that moment of weakness. I saw him every day working for someone . Naked, dirty... devoid of everything. And I couldn't help him. First of all, because of you. Now I think I'll take him with me and we'll leave. He will have your luck. I'll send them to school. That's what I'm going to do. I think you'll baptize the child in Catholic faith. Otherwise you have nothing to talk about with me. As until now. Yes. Anyway God is protecting him anyway. His godmother will be Mother Egidia. I went already to the monastery. I spoke to her. What are you doing, aren't you coming? Hans! I think we must start, right? Today... You love Bandi, don't you? Mr. Hans Huber... I didn't call you. will make his masterpiece cut here in front of you. Go inside and wait. she will divide and weigh a reed on her own without getting dirty, with the utmost speed and precision. After that, he will be in our guild of furriers and butchers as the third butcher in this fair. Hey, boy... are you going with me? Why? To see the world, to learn... Become a man. And especially to please Sida. I'm going, if Sida says so. She wants you to become a cultivated man. You'll be fine, boy. You will have everything. And as much money as you want. Why? I'll tell you later why. For now, I just want you to know that you have no one closer to this world than me. Did you know my mother? You know her? You still remember her. Boy... Don't tell me because I know. You're my father, aren't you?
