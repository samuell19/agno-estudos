Herbert. Look. From the way you stand there grinning .. Anyone would think you put that filling-station out there yourself. Well, there it is. Our troubles are over. For a while anyhow. Heaven only knows what it is doing out here. A thousand miles from anywhere. It will probably turn out to be a mirage. Well, what are you waiting for? Yes, Gladys. Gladys, dear. - Huh? Would you mind taking the brake off. You get that thing off there Herbert before this whole car explodes. You can't, Gladys, Like I told you out there in the desert. It's stuck tighter than aunt Annie's corset. We'll have to get a man to do it. And a man who could stand living out here in this heat could do anything. Yes. You can't see a thing coming in out of that glare. Why don't you watch where you are going. You just said yourself that sun was glaring. Hello. What can I do for you? You can have a man put some water in the car before the whole thing blows up. I'll call my sister. Olga! Yes, I am going. My sister will take care of it right away. Listen, young lady. This is no job for anybody's sister. You will have to get a man to take the cap off that radiator. And the way it's stuck on there it will take a darned good man. I am sorry. We have no men working here. Do you mean to say you two girls try to run this place all alone? And we are doing alright too. Can you come out a minute, mister? You've got it off? Well. Always goes to show a woman can do anything she puts her mind to. Phew. Give me a Coca-Cola before I expire. How long have you two girls been out here? A couple of years. - Ha. Well I don't see how you stand it. You get used to the heat after a while. Still, it isn't much of a life for a girl your age. No. It isn't very exciting. Pretty hot. - Fair. It's only a hundred and ten. Yeah? Only a hundred and ten? Practically winter cold for around here. People in town are still laughing at an African movie they showed last night. The man on the screen says: "Here in Africa folks A hundred and twelve in the shade, believe it or not." It was a hundred and twenty-five right there in the theater. A temperature like that don't sound like any joke to me. Herbert, get out of there! Every time you stick your nose in there it means another repair bill. You want a Coca-Cola? No. I'll take a lemon soda if they have got any. Say, there seems to be a knock in there somewhere. Well, you got a couple of spark plugs loose. Thank you. It's alright with me. You seem to like the heat and you seem to like the work. Well, you can have them. You are not hearing no complaints from me. I got 'em mister. You won't hear any complaints from me either. Here. Oh, I said lemon soda, Gladys. Didn't they have any? Yes. But you like Coca-Cola better. Don't drink out of the bottle Herbert. Use the straw. Alright. All set. How much does he owe you? Let's see. Ten, gas. Four, oil. That's 3.55. What have you got Myra? Just two cokes. That's 3.65 altogether. What is the best way to get to Williams? Follow the main highway to deep basin and then take the detour to route six. Detour? Nothing but detours. Come on, Herbert. I want to get to where there is some trees. Well. Good luck. Thanks. I'll need it. A happy couple. The condition that car was in would drive anybody crazy. It will go along better now. You really get a kick out of that don't you. A kick out of what? Out of just staying here and running this place. Seeing people drive away better off in some ways than when they drove in. Sure. Just give me a house by the side of the road and make me a friend man. I think you really do feel something like that. You just hate to admit it. I get a lot of satisfaction out of this place. Without admitting to any sappy idea to be the desert's leading social worker. Personally. I'd rather be one of the people that is going someplace. Where, for instance? Oh. Some place. Any place. When you're old enough to go places .. You'll be smart enough to realize that you're better off where you are. I hope. I'm not just like you, Olga. I can't be, about everything. You oughtn't expect me to be. I know you are happy out here running this place. Seeing the business build up and all that. You don't want anything more than that. I do. Well, I've got it figured out now. There is a dance in town tonight. Yes. Why not say so instead of giving a speech on different women's natures? Because you forget sometimes and I'm still young. No I don't. That's just why I've got to take care of you. Maybe you've forgotten that if a girl is young she likes get out once in a while. That's another reason why I have to take care of you. So far, you are your own worse witness. But Olga .. Anybody ask you to go to that dance? Yes. Steve Laird. He's the one that came out to see you last week. Pretended he came all this way just to get a packet of cigarettes. Yes. Why? Well, there is one dance I know he'll be a marvel at. He's got all the qualities. Snake hips. You don't know anything about him. You only saw him a few minutes. That was plenty. You'd say the same thing about any man. And have a very good percentage. It isn't fair. It isn't fair to keep me cooped up in a place like this all the time. I've got a right to have some fun while I'm young. Hello? Is Steve there? Hello Steve? This is Myra. Well. I could sneak out after Olga went to bed. But I hate to make her mad. You're not going to let me down are you? Just because your sister made a yell? Maybe you don't want to see me. Of course I do, darling. Alright. Come about ten-thirty. And park down the road aways. Alright, honey. Goodbye. I came be back to say I thought perhaps I was being a bit too hard on you. I .. Got thinking perhaps that because it all seemed so swell out here to me, I had .. Forgotten how dull it might be for a kid of your age. You mean I can go then? When Steve Laird sneaks down the road tonight at 10:30 I won't be sleeping. I am going to be right there to meet him. You won't. I certainly will. He and I are going to have our own little war dance. You just want to ruin everything for me. Ruin my whole life. I hope you don't think Steve Laird is your answer to peace and happiness. Well, maybe I don't understand your kind of peace and happiness. I know you don't understand my getting a thrill out of being with him. Yes, I do. It's the same thrill you get out of seeing a rat run across a bedroom floor. I don't care what you or anybody else says about him. I love him. You don't know what love means. Do you suppose you do? I might. No you don't. You never had any emotions. You never had any fun. And you don't want me to have any either. I wish I were dead. It is better to feel that way now because you are not going. Than to go .. and feel that way the morning after. How are you, Olga? Okay, Everett. Just dropped over to see how you are coming with the car. Coming along alright. I got a couple more hours working on it though. Yeah .. - Not now. I took a man's job out here and I'm doing a man's work .. And you are going to be charged a man's price. Well, I ain't very worried about the bill. If you think this car of yours needs a man's master touch .. You can have the boys at your ranch take care of it. Maybe I think you do a better job. Maybe. Maybe you just bring your work here to give us a break. You know I do think you put a couple of your boys to work breaking things. That's right. Just to give me an excuse to come down here. How is the kid sister today? Staging another little revolution. I had to jump on her pretty hard just now. Getting restless again, huh? She wants to go into town. Some dance tonight. You don't care much for mixed company, do you Olga? You put a man and woman together and it gets complicated. Oh, it ain't so bad sometimes. In fact they tell me it can be pretty nice. Well, I have heard it is apt to end up terrible. Well, anyway, you are right about Myra and that young bunch in town. A pretty wild young bunch when they get to raring. Yeah. It's going to be the worst one of the herd that goes for Myra. Do you know Steve Laird? That is something I wouldn't admit to in public. She thinks she is crazy about him. Funny how often a decent, respectable girl will fall for some worthless .. Yeah. But that is the way it works sometimes. Well, you keep him away from Myra, Olga. A thing like that couldn't come to any good. I've got every intention of keeping away, Everett. I hate to be tough on the kid but it's for her own good. She'll feel bad about if for a while. But someday she will realize it was for her own good. Yep. That's right. Hello, sister. What can we do for you? Gee. I'm sun-blinded. I can't see a thing. That's right. Just keep your hand over your face that way, Jeff. The lady is not feeling so good. And one look at that pan of yours is liable to send her to the hospital. I'm sorry. That's alright, sister. This heat would get anybody. Can I get you gentlemen something? - Yeah. A couple of beers. How about some sandwiches? We have some nice barbecued beef. Okay for me. How about you, punk? Okay. I'm practically barbecued myself. Say, what kind of a newspaper have you got around here? Monday's, from Los Angeles. Monday's huh? I was looking for something a little bit fresher than that. Say, the bread ain't that old too is it? No, sir. Want trimmings on your sandwiches? Certainly. Nothing but the best for us. Sorry about the paper. We get the news quicker from the radio there. Yeah, but not this time of day though, do you? No, along about evening. Even then sometimes the static is so bad we can't get anything. This time of year we have quite a bit of heat lightning, you know. Heat lightning, huh? That will give my pal a thrill. Won't it Jeff? - Yeah. That's all I need now. Something to remind me of .. It's enough to get on anyone's nerves. Just an old baboon and a couple of tomatoes. You can start wolfing that sandwich. I lose a lot of appetite every time I hear a car. I was just beginning to notice you were a little shaky. Can I help you? - Fill her up. Gas .. oil .. water. That reminds me. Say honey, can you tell us where .. Round the corner. The door on your left. - We get it. And take a look at the tires. - Yes, sir. Well. Let's have another one. It's good for your nerves. Yeah. Those nerves sure got me. What makes you so jittery, Jeff? You been drinking too much lately or is it a woman? After what we've been through you ask me why I'm jumpy. Listen. You're in the big time now. By the time you been around as much as me you won't think this is a tough spot. No, no. I ain't built like you. You got a heart so cold nothing could melt it. Not even the hot seat. That's something nobody is ever going to have a chance to find out, young fellow. Say, can we get something cold to drink around here? In the lunch room here. Have I lost my eyesight completely or do you see what I see? I see a pretty handsome guy behind the counter if that's what you mean. You ladies are seeing perfectly. Come right in and sit down. Why not. What are you going to have, ladies? Don't tell me a guy like you is really running this joint? Just passing through. Just a natural take-over guy, huh? Well, toss us a couple of bottles of beer. Say, big-shot. How'd you like to take over two girls .. Hitch-hiking their way to fame and fortune in Hollywood? Say, what about Popsy? We're going to cut him off like a hang-nail the first chance we get. How about it, handsome? You and I could go a long way together, couldn't we. Too bad we're not going in the same direction. Say, doesn't your boyfriend talk? Speak to the girls, Jeff. Hiya, toots. We got that all cleared up. What about the uncle Horace out there? He goes to Hollywood and the movies too? As far as I can make out he is on a lecture tour. All he's done since we picked him up in Kansas City .. Is give us speeches about nice girls not hitch-hiking. If that's all he did it wouldn't be so bad. But he tries to find out if our legs are in good condition. I can't get upset about you two tomatoes being unable to take care of yourselves. I got a hunch the old man it the one who is really in a tough spot. You should have seen him when the cops stopped the car up in Allentown. What did they stop the car for? They were looking for a couple of guys who stuck up a bank in Salt Lake City. Can you imagine that old toad robbing a bank, shooting a couple of cashiers .. And scramming with the dough? Well, you never can tell by the looks of them. Forty-five. And here are the pennies. Three-48 exactly. - Thank you. Alright, girlies. We are ready to go. Say. It's your turn to sit up front with that old thigh-pincher. I'm going to crawl in the back seat and nurse my wounds. When you see us in the movies you can tell folk you bought beer for us once. I sure am sorry we are not going the same way. Well. You go your way and we'll go the way of all flesh. Yes, sir. Say Pop, don't forget to ask about the road. Yes. And we're going to listen in on directions this time .. So you don't take us up so many of those lonely side roads. Yes, yes. Of course. Could you direct me and my young nieces .. Easy to see those dames leave happiness and cheer after them wherever they go. All they wanted was 2 mugs who stuck up a bank and killed a couple of cashiers. I said they was hot after us, George. Come, let's go. Listen. Let me do the worrying. I did the shooting. Yeah. Yeah, you did the shooting. But I've been regretting it ever since. If a guy don't know any more than to monkey with me .. It's in the books against him. That's all. Those two guys were born to be drilled at 2 o'clock Tuesday .. And that's when they got it. Do you want another barbecued sandwich? I can already hear the warden .. Asking me if I've any last words to say before they turn on the heat. And you ask me if I want another barbecued sandwich. Come on, let's scram. - Sit down. Sit down. Yeah. I should be calm and collected like you. Why don't you sit down? - I'm thinking. That's an alibi you can't get away with. Say, wait a minute. Uhoh. Something tells me there is another dame. Well, from this distance it looks like I am just barely right. Say. Who is that woman down by the garage? That is my sister, Olga. Want to see her? - Yeah. Olga, there is a gentleman here wants to see you. Hello, Olga. Jerry. Sure, the old boy himself. You are the last person I expected to see out here. Why not? I do a lot of travelling. Gee, I'm glad to see you. How are you? Fine. Sure you are. You always were. You couldn't be any other way. You are the same too. Oh no, I am changed. Leading a better life. I can imagine. So, what you doing here? Just passing through on business and stopped for gas. I wondered if I would ever see you again. But I never thought it would be in a place like this. What are you doing out here? Making an honest living, Jerry. That is something you wouldn't know much about. Well come on. I want you to meet my friend Jeff. Jeff. - Yeah? I was right. Meet an old friend of mine from Oklahoma. How do you do. Myra, you go and service their car, will you. So that's the kid sister, huh? The one you had in school. Yes. And she doesn't know anything about you. Or the cabaret back in Tulsa. That's the way I'd like to have it left. Sure. Trust me. Thanks. Desert towns don't ask any questions. It's no good telling people things they aren't interested in. How long you been out here? Long enough to build up something that I don't want to see torn down. Say, do me a favor. Take this thing .. - What's the matter with it? The girl with the most beautiful head of hair in the country .. And she's covered it up with a speckled bandanna. I am dressed to work. It might be a break after all. - What? Meeting her here. She used to be crazy about me. Looks like she got over it. - Yeah? She held out against me sometimes but I can twist her about if I take trouble. There is one dame I can do anything I want with. Yeah? You'd better do something quick then. It looks like a cop just drove up. Some Hick sheriff. You haven't seen any suspicious characters around here have you? None of them look suspicious to me. Whose car is that? - Two men in the lunch room. I guess I'll step in and take a look at them. I told J.A. there wasn't any oil down there but he said to go ahead and drill. So we went ahead. Let's have another bottle of beer. Oh, I thought you were the lady. You folks in the oil business? You hit the nail on the head. What is your name? The lady there has known me for several years. Yes. I have known Mr Schiff for a long while. That's alright then, Olga. How about a cold drink, Sheriff? - No, thanks. I'll be on my way. Can we get something to drink here? Yes, ma'am. Beer. Soda water. Coca-Cola. I'll have some beer. - Yes, ma'am. Shall I bring it out? - No, no. We'll go in and get out of the heat. Come on. Can I get some service on this motor? I'll send my sister. - Huh? I said, I'll get my sister. She'll fix you up. I doubt it. You will get fat drinking that, Tinkle. You really will. I don't care. I've got to do something. I am definitely passing out. Olga, the chauffeur wants service. In a minute. Will you have something? I don't know. Is there a rush? Well if you'll decide, I'll go and service your car. Oh, you do that too? Yes. - What a woman. I'll go tend to your car. You know I told you in Reno, Tinkle. We should have brought a nip with us. I know you and your nips. I didn't want you to get tight on me. - Nah. I guess everything is wide open in Reno, huh? Yes. Rather. I was there once. Only once? Well, I was there on business. So were we. Mrs Tifton. Yes, Frank? Beg pardon, ma'am. But I don't think it's safe to go any further in that car. Not until I get the head gasket fixed. Well, how long will that take? I can't say exactly. I thought it would be better if we would wait until morning. Wait? Where? Oh you could stop here. This is sort-of an auto-camp. Yes. We can put you up. If you want to take what we have to offer. Well isn't there a town near here? Baker. 26 miles. There is a hotel there. I can't be responsible for no 26 miles, ma'am. Well, let's look at the rooms. If you come this way I'll show you the shed. Sheds? Can you imagine? Sheds. If you was in the middle of the Sahara Desert you'd find dames. Come on, let's scram. I want to get across that border. - Wait a minute. I got an idea. I was afraid of that. Did you see the rocks on those babies? Yeah, and I saw the badge on that sheriff. Come on, let's get going. They are carrying a hundred grand and probably more in their baggage. We need dough worse than they do. Come on, George. - You heard me. They are not very deluxe. - Well, I should say not. What do you say? I'm game. Nothing else to do unless Frank gets the car fixed. We'll go on after dinner. Well, where is my little shed? Myra, will you show the lady to number 3. I will get you some towels. That will be nice. Where are you going? How long are you staying? I thought we'd have dinner and push along when it gets cooler. The sun will be down in a few minutes. It gets cooler almost immediately then. What's the matter, are you trying to rush me? No. Why should I? You said a while ago you were going right away. Now you are going to stay. I am just wondering what you are up to. Still as suspicious as ever. I don't believe you have changed into an angel. I was just waiting for a chance to talk to you. It's a long time since we had a talk. It's longer than that since we've had anything worthwhile talking about. Why did you run out on me? I didn't run. I just left. After all those years together. You could have told me. To have you talk me into staying? Do you like it better here than you did in Tulsa? I'm happy here. I know what living is about for the first time. I wouldn't change what I've got here for anything. Never get lonesome? I'm too busy. I bet you think about the old town once in a while. Oil flares lighting up the streets. Everything wide open, dance halls, gambling, girls. Yeah. Don't forget the girls. Let's be friends, Olga. Stop it, Jerry. How many times I held that hand. How many times I .. - Don't be a fool. I am being honest, Olga. It did something to me meeting you here today. And you can't say it meant nothing to you. I saw your face when you recognised me. - Let's understand each other, Jerry. If you're staying because you've ideas in your head, you better be on your way. I am not anything like that woman you knew back in Oklahoma. Whatever I was before I am different now. And I intend to stay different. Everything between you and me is past. Forgotten. I left you and that whole rotten life. I came out here and I started fresh and clean. I work pretty hard for what I've got. I'm not going to lose it now. Nor for you, not for anybody. So don't think I'm the same woman that used to eat out of your hand as I'm not. I am a whole lot wiser. And just you put that into that head of yours. Sure. Sure. Buenos dias, Se?or. - Buenos d?as, Se?ora. [ Spanish language ] This Jeepney, she is one good car. But she is too much old. Her insides always falling out. In daytime it's alright. You can fix it quick. But Se?ora, at the night-time she is no good. Very bad for travelling this way. Comprendo? Mucho comprendo. Where you going? We go Juarez. - Fiesta? Si. Me like to camp here for the night. Alright. One dollar. We ain't got no money. Me no like to sleep in the shed. I like to sleep outside. Fresh air better. Alright. Over there. Back of the shed. Gracias. Hey, hold on. Wait a minute. I guess I can explain to you, lady. After all, it's for your own benefit. If that pounding is for my benefit you can stop right now. Look. I'm making out like the car ain't in running order yet. You go on pounding and you'll be absolutely right. That car won't run for days. No, you don't get the idea, lady. You see, I got them two dames all unpacked and set for the night. If I tell them the car is all fixed .. They'll likely get it into their heads to start out again. I'm tired driving, lady. And if I have to pack and unpack that lingerie many more times .. I'll turn into a big sissy. You're pretending the car isn't in good running order, huh? Sure, sure. Now you got it. It's okay with you, ain't it? - I didn't hear a word you said. Fine. Thanks. And you can sock them plenty without feeling bad because they got plenty. I'll go and break the news to them. Well. I'm sorry ma'am, but that car won't be ready until the morning. You are not sorry and you know it. You'd just as soon we stayed all night in this horrible place. Ah well, if we must we must. But Frank will have to stay on guard all night to protect us. You may have to protect me, Frank. But I wouldn't worry about Mrs Tifton. She is her own best protection. You are drunk, Tinkle. You are drunk again. I am not. [ Hic ] Unfortunately. You know I don't feel it a bit myself. I think it is a fake. This rumor about putting aspirin in this stuff. Completely a fake. And you should certainly know a fake when you see one, my dear. After that last husband of yours. Fortunately, I can discard any fakes I may find and go on to something better. Frank, bring me a bottle of beer. Yes, ma'am. Too bad you can't drink any beer, dear. Of course. On account of your figure. Frank. Two beers. Right. Two beers. The cat. [ Radio ] "14 people were injured. The cause of the explosion hasn't been determined." "At Vancouver, James Hogan, believed to be one of the gang .." "Responsible for the shooting of the guards .." "Of the security trust of Salt Lake during an attempted robbery yesterday." "Was arrested here late this afternoon while attempting to enter Canada." "The other two members of the gang are still at large." "And are headed for the Mexican border. A coast-wide search has been held." Either of the two dames that run this joint around? I think they are back in their rooms. I guess I'll help myself to the beer. Tell them to put it on the bill later. I'd better grab one for myself while I am here. I won't get a chance later. I thought you were staying here tonight. - We are. That's the trouble. What a night I'll have, protecting them. They give you that, do they? Do they? I won't get a wink of sleep. All night long they'll be calling me. First one and then the other. On some excuse. You must be quite a man. No. I ain't had anything to do with them. Either of them. No? - No. Sometimes I think maybe that Mrs Tifton is going to get me. Now, she ain't so bad. But the other one pays off. And they are both jealous of each other. I told them I got a wife and two kids in Flatbush. But that only seemed to encourage them. Lots of boys would be glad to suffer for you. I don't know now. Two guys paid plenty to get rid of those two dames. And I guess it was worth it to them. The two girls struck plenty of gold in Reno, huh? Well, you seen them rocks they was wearing, didn't you? Yeah. I thought I was getting blinded once when the sun hit those two dames. Yeah. You'd think they was wearing all the jewelry they got. But they ain't. They has plenty more. I guess I have seen more. Bigger and better. Yeah? Where? Well maybe in Tiffany's. Oh well sure. In Tiffany's. Yeah. Who is he, Olga? - Who? Nobody much. Someone I used to know back in Oklahoma. You never told me about him. I didn't think it was necessary. Did you used to be in love with him, Olga? It must be your romantic day. I don't know. The way you looked at him made me sorta wonder. You were in love sometime. Weren't you? Perhaps. Then I think you'd understand. Listen. If this is just a build-up for another argument about Steve Laird .. And that dance tonight you can stop right now because you are not going. I said you could have another sandwich if you were hungry. I ain't hungry. I can already feel that prison diet. So can Hogan. They nabbed him. How do you know? It just came in on the radio. Holy cats. Well, let's scram. Let's not stall around here all night. We're not going to stall around here all night stupid. Well I ain't. I know that. - Now listen. Sit down. And listen. My neck is just as valuable to me as yours is to you. And I am not going to do anything that will put a rope around it. We're staying long enough to get our hooks on the rocks the dames lug around. We're in a tough spot. We may have to do some greasing to get across the border. Thanks. I am glad you let me in on the plot. We got our own new deal coming up. Prosperity is just across the border. Jerry. I'd like to talk to you for a minute. So what? So, I think you had better go now. I thought that as we knew each other so well there wasn't a need for me to rush. Why are you staying on, Jerry? Just a change of mind. I was always like that wasn't I? I remember very well what you were like. I don't know what you are pulling now. With my memory working so good I am sure there is something phony about it. You are not fooling me. Am I trying to? You're not worried about what I am going to do or anything else except yourself. You're afraid of what you will do if I stay. Oh, I am in love with you, am I? Yes, I was in love with you then. I cannot deny that. I was so in love with you I couldn't think of anything else. And all the time knowing how rotten you were. Do you think I like that? I hated it. I'd wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat .. And wonder how I could love a man like you. That is something that has passed. That's all over. Things have changed a lot. I have changed a lot. Yeah, you are right. You have changed plenty. You had a lot on the ball then though. You were something to look at, get up and go for. That was my racket then. It never got me anything but trouble. I figured the thing to do was to go as far as possible in the other direction. You sure made a good job of it. When I say you out there today. You know, like you are now. I couldn't believe you were ever a dame I went for. I couldn't believe .. That's something that it's alright with me if you forget. You sure make it plenty tough to remember very good. I knew you must have had something for me because you wanted me and you got me. Now you don't want me and you certainly fixed everything up to keep me away. Don't you worry about me trying to get you back. Because there ain't a chance in the world, sweetheart. [ Spanish singing ] Frank. Yes, ma'am? I should like to take a bath, Frank. Since when have you developed such intimacy with the chauffeur .. That you find it necessary to advise him of such things? Frank, I should like you to see if there are any conveniences for bathing .. On this lovely little oasis. Yes, ma'am. I suppose you want Frank to scrub your back? You're just jealous because you didn't think of taking the bath yourself. Miss. One of the ladies wants to know if there's any chance of taking a bath. There is a small tub around there by the pump. You can fill it with water and take it to the back of the sheds. You mean she has got to take it sort-of out in the open back there? Sorry. That is all we have to offer. I suppose her dignity wouldn't allow bathing in public. You ain't knowed her as long as I have. I suppose you hid my lipstick to make sure I couldn't go to the dance. No. Just a minute. Thanks. I thought you'd have the good sense to forget about that dance tonight. Ah, how romantic. This is all they got for you to take a bath in, Mrs Tifton. Oh, how romantic. And where do I take my bath in that finger bowl? Out back of the sheds. Right back to your childhood days, Feathers. What was that? I mean my dear, out the back of the shed. After all, that is where it all really started. Isn't it? I suppose you want Frank to stand guard while you take your bath? Thank you so much for suggesting it, Tinkle. That is a splendid idea. You are quite welcome. However, I think I had better come back and guard Frank. Well, Olga. Is there something special going on tonight? You certainly do look nice. Thanks, Everett. Sit down. New duds make quite a change in a woman, don't they. Yeah. Quite a change. Sometimes they must prove to themselves they're still as pretty as they were. I've got to admit it. You have done it. Well, that is very complimentary from you. I thought you might be kind of tired of seeing me in those same old overalls. Seeing you like that takes me back to the old days, Olga. You two knew each other before? Yes. We were old friends back in Oklahoma. In fact, if I don't sound too conceited .. I was head man among Olga's admirers. At least I thought I was. That wouldn't make much difference. All that is a long ways away. That's what I thought until I saw you come out there a minute ago. It doesn't seem so far now. Yes .. I been looking. Everett has seen it before. He knows I can still look fairly nice if I want to. Yeah. Sure, Olga. [ Female scream! Loud ] What is the matter? [ Female scream! ] Help, help! A man, a man! I don't believe it, Feathers. You don't run away like that from men. But it was. There he is, there he is! I want that man arrested immediately. Wait a minute, lady. What is the beef? I demand this man's arrest. He is a peeping Tom. Listen. She has got me all wrong. I'm out taking a walk, see. How'd I know I'd round a corner and see a dame with a bar of soap in her hands? I ain't used to seeing women taking baths in the middle of the desert. Well, you certainly stared as though you had never seen a woman at all before. Listen, toots. I seen plenty. And I seen a lot better than you. Well, you certainly seemed to be enjoying it at the time. You could have turned round if you didn't like it. Yeah? If you didn't like it you could have ducked down. It don't take no longer to do one than the other. I demand this man's arrest immediately! That might not be wise. The gentleman may enter counter charges asking your arrest for immoral exposure. Huh? You go to bed and be quiet, Feathers. Oh! I have something really important I would like to take up with you, Miss .. Go down to the shed and get our things together. We'd better be on our way. Before you get us into some serious trouble. But it's those gypsies I am really afraid of. What gypsies? It was alright as long as they stayed by their fire. But now I think they are sending their children over as spies. But they aren't gypsies and they're just harmless. They are just a Mexican family on its way to a fiesta. Well, perhaps. But I would feel much safer if all of our jewels were locked up some place. Well, I'll put them in the safe for you. They will be perfectly alright there. Alright. If you knew how much these jewels are worth and how hard I worked for them .. You would realize what I am so worried. I assure you, you have nothing to worry about with them in the safe. Just getting myself a last bottle of beer. Put it on the bill. Get the bill ready, will you. I'm going to pull out of here in a few minutes. You are sure this time? It is better to travel at night and sleep after we get there in the morning. Alright. I will see you before you go. Sure. Say listen, boss. Are we really leaving this time or are we just fooling again? Just fooling. Just playing around. When we're staying we're leaving. If we're leaving we're staying. You got me all mixed up. - We are good and mixed up this time. They just put the jewels in the safe. I'm sure glad to hear that. You are, huh? - Yeah. Now we can quit stalling around here and scram across that border. We're not leaving here until we grab those rocks. You just said they were in the safe. - Don't let that worry you. It's a break for us. You can open that safe with a toothpick. And we won't have to take chances soft-shoeing into those dames' sheds. What of the dame that runs the joint? Don't worry about her. I'm a man that can take care of Olga alright. So you changed your mind again, Jerry? - I'm really going this time. It's not going to be as easy as I thought. What? - Giving you the farewell nod. You've softened up, haven't you. Never used to be hard for you to say goodbye. Well, we all make mistakes and then find out afterwards we were wrong. I saw my mistake and I'm doing better now. Yeah, you keep telling me you've been doing alright since we broke up. Well, so have I. - Alright then. Let's leave it that way. Personally, I will admit that seeing you here again did something to me. It brought back some of the .. Well, whatever it was, between us. We had some rotten times in the old days and we had some swell ones. I'm remembering the swell ones now. You seem to be remembering the rotten ones. I am remembering both, Jerry. I am calling it evens. And quits. Alright. Is that the way it is? That's the way it is. Goodbye. Goodbye. Olga. You don't mind if I talk to you do you? Until your friend gets back? I don't often get a chance to talk to city men. If you want to talk, go ahead and talk. I'll try and give you the answers. Pretty music, ain't it. Yeah. Hey. Wake up. You are home. Steve, darling. Feeling alright, kid? Think you can make it? I guess so. Steve. What? Will you call me? Yeah, sure. Sure. It's getting late, kid. I got to get back. Goodnight, Myra. Goodnight. Goodnight, honey. So long. I've been waiting my chance, see. And that big ranch owner has been round talking to me just a little while ago. Alright. Now get started. Listen, George. We shouldn't make these dames take the rap. Anyway, we haven't the time. Get started. So you went with Steve Laird after all. Yes. What about it? You are a pretty sight. Never mind the lecture. I don't feel like being balled out. Well, it looks like it's a little late for that now. Too late for you to read the riot act. What do you mean by that? Don't stand there and look at me like that. What if I have been out? What about yourself? Why don't you save some of those speeches for yourself? It looks like you deserve them as much as I do. All this talk about you going to protect me. You meeting Steve, to make sure I don't go out. You're going to see that nothing happens to me. Where were you when Steve came? Why didn't you stop me? I'll tell you. Because you were with a man yourself. Myra! Well, you were right anyway. Oh. But you can't blame me. - No. Not when you are just as much to blame. It looks like it runs in the family. Come on. Hurry it up. I'm hurrying. But this is going to take time. I ain't much for this job anyway. You'll get that box open and get it open quick. There now. Go to sleep. I can't do it, boss. - Get going. I can't do it I tell you. I won't do it. That dame has been too regular with us and we're in enough trouble now. I'm going to beat it while I've got a chance. Maybe that knocks sense into you. You get that safe open. I didn't spend all that time with the dame for nothing. Nobody ever got yellow with me that didn't get hurt. We got no time to fool around. You get that safe open and get it open quick. Olga. Well. I had to get it someday. Jerry. It's alright. What they done. See. I had it coming. Don't let anybody put anything over on you. That's the way to get along in the world. That's what I always done. You still got you old style, Olga. You always told me I'd end up .. Just like the old days. You are a good kid, Olga. But who cares. What about me? You can go. You won't send them after me? - No. Your car is alright. Take the main highway and then Detour 6. You ought to be able to make it. Say. Say, thanks. Go on. We thought we heard shooting. You did. I found a big rat running around in the lunch room. Well, that's a relief. I thought it must be those gypsies. Well, now that we are all awake can't we get started before it gets hot? Where have you been, Frank? Well .. you see .. Mrs Tifton got scared and I was protecting her. You have such a quaint way of wording things, Frank. That's what I was doing, ma'am. Honest. I suppose that is the way you got lipstick on your cheek. I'm leaving here immediately. If you two lovebirds want to come along you can. As far as the next town. Everything alright, Olga? - Yes, Everett. There seemed to be something in the air last night and I .. I stuck around pretty late. Finally, I decided you knew what you were doing so I went home. After I got home I got worried again. I guess that was silly. I should have known you could take care of yourself alright. Yeah. I can take care of myself alright. Yes. I shot him. He had it coming to him, huh? - Yeah. He tried to hold up the place. What about the other one? He couldn't go thorough with it so I sent him away. I guess he's making for the border. Everett. Will you take care of that in there .. for me? Tell the sheriff about it and everything. That fellow meant something to you once. Didn't he, Olga? Something. Once. It must be a big help sometimes being like you, 0lga. Not having any feelings. I wouldn't know, Everett. Fill her up. Gas, oil, water. Everything. I got to get started before the day gets hot. This place sure is a lifesaver, lady. I thought I was going to be in a tough spot. Do you run this place by yourself? With my sister. A pretty quiet life, isn't it? Yeah. Pretty quiet. -(Ro-s)-
