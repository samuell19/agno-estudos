I'll just come meet you. - He wants to meet up. - Tell him you're far away, dingus. I'm... I'm far away. At a fair. - You're at a fair? - No. - Don't say "affair." - Not "affair." A fair, as in like a fair with a Fer... Ferris wheel. Not "affair." He's my cousin, that would be... That would be incest. And not the hot kind. You're digging a hole. Yeah, buddy, anyway, me and Gerald are just diggin' holes - at the fair, and, um... - Dude. How fucked up are you right now? You wanna hang up the phone now? I gotta... Gerald's... I gotta, man... I gotta go. I love you, though. Be safe. Bye! Bye. Bye. - What the fuck was that? - Why would you pick up? Oh, why would you put me in this position? How 'bout that? [CELL PHONE RINGING] See how easy that was? That was... You guys are like two geniuses who use the pull-out method, you know? One day you're gonna fuck while you're ovulating, and you're going to have a baby. - Well, I like the pull-out method, so... - [CELL PHONE RINGING] Holy shit. And he knows. Why is he calling you? I don't know. He's outside right now. With a machete. And he's gonna cut us into cubes, and he's gonna put us in trash cans all over the city. I'm gonna let it go to voicemail. You should see what he wants. What? [SOFTLY] What? Okay. Um... - Hello? - Hey, dawg. How can I help you? By not talking to me like you're a robot. - How can I help you, Nick? - That's better. Thank you. I just wanted to call and say thanks for the text. I didn't know what to write back. - Uh-huh. - So I just called instead, which, I guess, creates the same kinda problem. Yeah, it kinda does. So, um... Hey, I'm sorry about Clara. You know, it just... It happened really fast and... Yeah. Um, you don't need to explain anything. Ben says that she's a great girl. Well... Okay. Bye. Bye, April. You just really felt the need to text him "Happy Birthday"? You know, me talking to him or not talking to him wasn't specified rules. Because it's... [SIGHS] so obvious. Are you still in love with him? No. Are you in love with him? No. I would tell you that. There's a party on Saturday. You wanna go together, like, in disguise? Is it that Bruno Shabaz thing? Yeah. You know about that? Yeah. Uh, Nick's going. Okay, so let's just skip it. I was probably just gonna go with him. Yeah. So... I'll just skip it. Cool. Cool. MOLLY: Well, whatever. I'm so over high school parties anyways. - Yeah, me, too. - SALLY: Yeah, we've evolved. - Your ID is kinda bootleg, though. - [BOTH LAUGH] It says you're vision impaired? I did that for realism. Okay, but it says that you're 5'11". That was a typo. You should've got it done from these guys that we met. - They're Romanian. - Mmm-hmm. I mean, if I don't get in, we can just do something else. You're gonna get in. It's gonna be fun. [DEADPAN] Yay. Oh, we're gonna miss you so much! Oh, you have to visit us in Miami! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] Bold move, Krillholtz. Are they in the vicinity? Why? What do you have planned? Nothing. I wanna stay as far away as humanly possible. Right. Okay, they're over there, - so we're gonna go this way and have a great time... - Thanks, Ben. BEN: That's not chill. What'd you expect? - Thank you. - Mmm. [CLEARS THROAT] Pass me that bottle of brown stuff. I'm not passing you licorice schnapps. Why not? Because you're not a homeless person. - BEN: Ugh! - [CELL PHONE DINGS] - Well, that's rich. - What? BEN: Ah. Hmm. CLARA: Are you okay? NICK: Yeah. It's just, uh... that girl Ben was with earlier... You mean your ex-girlfriend? How do you know about that? I have the Internet. [CELL PHONE DINGS] Who's Brad Pitt? Um, that is my friend, Olivia, from home. We're just, like, obsessed with Fight Club. Maybe we should just go. Why should we go? She can go. Right, but you know what? I'll split the Lyft with ya, we can get some food on the way. It'll be dope. Let's bounce. Let's go. I just got here. Why is everyone always tryin' to get me to leave the party? Everyone isn't. Ben is, in order to save lifelong relationships. You know what? Let's just stay. And have fun. Yeah, okay. Fuck it. - Let's have fun. Cheers. - Yeah. Do you wanna go? No. Why? I mean, I don't know if you're uncomfortable she's here. I'm not uncomfortable. Okay. Is it uncomfortable for you? No. I'm not uncomfortable at all. You know, there's a, like, a really wicked EDM scene in Boulder, and they do, like, these insane laser shows at Red Rocks. I didn't know you were a laser enthusiast. I'm a huge laser enthusiast. [BOTH CHUCKLE] That's one of the many things that you don't know about me. I'm sorry. Man, it's gonna be weird when we don't see each other regularly. I mean, you could always come visit me. For sure. I'm gonna bring my laser arsenal. - I mean, that was implied. - Yeah. One goes like, "Pew-pew-pew." The others are like, "Zing-zong, zing-zong." - Your lasers make noises? - Uh-huh. - [CHUCKLES] - Okay. That's... That's cool. [ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING] Oh. NICK: Let's just go say hi. Uh... It's just weirder not to. - Hey, guys. - Oh! Sorry. This is the dance party area. For dancers. - Yo! Nick, what's up, man? - What's up, man? Um, April, this is Clara. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too, Claire. It's Clara. You have a very firm handshake. - Very strong. - So do you. - Do you work out? - Do I work out my hands? Okay. I'm so glad we can all be here, and it's not awkward. Right. Not all of us are as drunk as you are. Well, it is the last party of our high school. Seems like you're having a difficult time moving on. [FORCED LAUGH] Should we get shots? I want shots. Shots. - Yes, please. Nick? - Yes! Can't wait. Yes. That would be great. I'll take one. Can we go, please? Actually, we're just gonna go. BEN: Yeah? Go ahead and say it. Say what? Everything. I'm an idiot. I don't think we should do this in front of Steve. - Oh, fuck Steve! Come on. - Jesus! This is what you've been waiting for. Lay it on me. Yeah, well, what are you? A dock worker? - Lay it on me! - No yelling in the Lyft, please. Look, I don't have to tell you you're an idiot. You know you're an idiot. - Well, she's the one who started it. - We're not six years old, April! Oh, don't yell in the Lyft, Ben! I thought you wanted me to lay it on you. Well, I changed my mind. - What is it you want? - I don't know. - Sorry. - DRIVER: Get out! Like, get out here? Yeah, let's stop. - It's there. - What? Nothing. Okay. - I'm gonna order a new car. - Absolutely. - Surging. - Is it? [SIGHS] [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] Are you here to murder me? I don't think murderers tell their victims they're outside. Where's Clara? I don't know. She's at home. Did you leave with Ben last night? We split a Lyft. Clara's tits looked pretty vibrant last night. Can we not talk about her? Why? She's your girlfriend. She's not my girlfriend. Then what is she? This isn't the conversation I wanna have. What conversation did you wanna have? I think about you all the time. And then, seeing you last night... You broke up with me! - You broke up with me. - After you brought it up. That was hypothetical. Don't you miss me at all? [POP MUSIC PLAYING] NICK: Oh. APRIL: Okay. Oh! [APRIL LAUGHS] ♪ If I washed my clothes and I combed my hair ♪ Would you look at me the same? ♪ All this time I believed I had lost control ♪ But this doesn't have a name ♪ If I swim down the middle and I worked real hard ♪ Could I learn to shut you out?

Nick Ellis can't pronounce the word "arugula." Arugyula. - Arugula. - Arugyula. Arugula. Attention. April Krillholtz used to flirt with me in history class. Oh, my God. You texted me cute little monkey emojis - while we were learning about genocide. - [CHUCKLES] Yeah. It's 'cause I had a demented crush on you. I'm pretty sure that you had a crush on me, too.

He broke up with me. Hey! - He just showed up at my house. - Oh, really? How long after you showed up at the party? - That's not why I went. - Okay. Why'd you go? I had English with Bruno Shabaz. You don't even know him! Bruno Shabaz is not the point! If it were the other way around, you would've gone. You don't fucking know that! You loved boxing me out of my own life. And you loved making me your creepy boyfriend placeholder. That's not true! Using me so you could sneak your way back to him! Well, at least you got everything you wanted, acting like... Like he was your wife and I was your mistress. [SCOFFS] I'm sure you would've loved that, April. What the fuck does that mean? I am not the one that's fucked like half of Fresno. Have fun on your bus ride back to Mommy's. I was with him for two years. You were with him for two months. [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] [CLEARS THROAT] You know you're fired, right? You've, uh, exhibited limited personal growth, so... We have to tell Nick. About you and Clara? About you and me. That's a hilarious joke. Just to be clear, you were also in those bushes, buddy. I'm developing an ulcer talking to you right now. You're 18 years old. You're not developing an ulcer. Funny story. I actually had an ulcer when I was 12. You should see a doctor, then. I did. He told me to avoid stressful situations. He's gonna find out eventually. Well, isn't that the most familiar sentence in the history of this fucking summer. I... I know. I just... [SIGHS] We're all leaving. Right. And before we go to college, we should all hate each other. Forever. I feel like if we have this shit hanging over our heads, then we would hate each other forever. Shit that you created. At least this gives us some kind of chance. We could do it together. Strength in numbers. [SIGHS] [INAUDIBLE] I feel like an asshole. You're not the asshole. Obviously. You're the asshole. Okay, well, there's one other thing. I'm friends with Clara. Or, we were friends. Are you Brad Pitt? I wasn't trying to hurt you. Or... I was. I was trying to hurt you at first... but then I just really liked her. Please don't let me ruin things for you and Ben. - SUSAN: Oh. - [SOBBING] DMV TESTER: Whenever you're ready. [APRIL CLEARS THROAT] Hey. Want half this cookie? Is it sativa or an indica? It's a hybrid. [SNIFFLES] No hat. What do you think? I'll be home in two months. I've never been away from you for more than two weeks. Seems like the world will keep spinning. Yeah, you have this little strumpet to keep you company. - Kiss my fat ass. - You kiss my fat ass. - You kiss my fat ass. - You kiss my fat ass. - You kiss my fat ass. - You kiss my fat ass. No! We were going to have one dinner that does not end in talk of kissing asses and sucking dicks. Your mouths are staying away from each other's genitals. Your mouths are staying on your faces and eating this fucking salmon that I made. You're my daughters, my only two daughters, and you're growing up, and April is going off to college, and we are gonna make a very fucking nice memory! All right, they do this in France. Ooh! I'll clean that up. All right. Cheers. Mom, you are so cool right now. Yeah, I know. Thank you. Just so you know, I'm over Nick. You can have him, if you want. Oof. He peaked in the 11th grade. But there's a boy in my class I've been texting. Isn't that a little young for you? He shaves. [APRIL AND SUSAN LAUGH] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Hey, is April here? I just need to talk to her for... - Ugh! That girl's here! [KNOCKING] I... [SIGHS] I kinda had this whole speech planned... but I'm not really sure if it was any good. I'd still be interested in hearing it. Well... basically the main thing was, I'm sorry for getting angry at you because you were upset. that I was fucking your ex-boyfriend. If you follow that. I do. Yeah. And I'm sorry for throwing Icee at your face. You threw it at my boobs. I was aiming for your face. Well, I deserved it. You were right. I went to that party because I was jealous you were with him. [SOFTLY] I know. But really, I was jealous that he was with you. I had a lot of fun with you this summer. Me, too. [VOICE BREAKING] I'm sorry I fucked it up. Well, can we un-fuck it up? I mean, when do you leave? Tomorrow. At 3:00. So... Oh. I was gonna show up at your door in the morning. I was gonna drive there. Because I drive now. You got your license? Krillholtz! - [SQUEALS] - [SCREAMS] So... where are we going? You're the one that's leaving. You choose. - So you're staying in LA? - For now. I'm thinking about checkin' out some canary schools. [POP MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY ON STEREO] 'Cause I'll be back in November. - Mmm-hmm. - And December. And summer, so June, July, August. And we can FaceTime. So, like, a long-distance relationship. Exactly. But without the sex. Good. Because I love you, but I'm not gonna have sex with you. What'd you say? I said we are never fucking. You said you loved me. Oh, my God... Yeah, I love you. Don't ruin the moment. But I want to ruin it! I love you, too. I love you so much! [INCREASES VOLUME] Okay, but you, you love me. - Where are we going? - I don't know. [BOTH LAUGH] All right. You love me. Oh, God. ♪ Winter beats ♪ It strikes for you and me ♪ Don't let that cold blood freeze ♪ 'Cause frozen love still bleeds ♪ Winter beats ♪ It strikes for you and me ♪ Don't let that cold blood freeze ♪ 'Cause frozen love still bleeds ♪ [ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING]
