Imagine... almost 2000 km in just 19 hours! I do not understand how you are able memorize all that. Damn, could you not go on a vacation like a normal person? This has nothing to do with a holiday. Look, the puny supermarket chick is crazy about you. And, she too loves the countryside. I do not have time for that. Furthermore, I'm not going to be here. Your bloody obsession with train timetables...! But you see, I'm totally prepared for the championship. And what do you take, if you win? - 50,000 Marks. Not bad ... But, if you don't have anyone to spend that money with... C'mon! Every rail expert is gonna be there! It's an international competition! And not a single woman I suppose! Klaus? Has already given you those days off? Yes. - All the best. Thanks. You take care. Sorry, kid. Could you help me clean the dashboard? Hello. - Good morning. Hannes. - Yes? For you.

I do not understand. - What do not you understand? Let me make this clear... You saw that man just leaving? I didn't want to let go off him, but I still am going to have to. And that will be the fate of all who are not committed to work. Are you able to understand? But Mr. Klaus ... - I do not care what you have to say. Goodbye. I want to work. I need this job! It will only be one week. I have to go to that championship! - I do not care. And don't you dare shout. The door is there. Dear Lothar: Lifke fired me. Do not worry, I'll be back by the 30th. Hannes. Ladies and gentlemen, in a few minutes we reach Koldruck. So? A punch in the face. The skull, as it hit the safe, has fractured. That in turn caused a cerebral hemorrhage.

I'll call you once I get to talk to him. Will come Sein?joki and file for divorce. Definitely. Do you know the train route to Antona? The conductor says we should've got off at the last station. Where are you actually headed? - To Saint Peter. The train to Antona there, comes late by ten minutes. Better make the change at the Central Station. There you can catch the Intercity to Westerland.

Delicious cookies sir. - Thank you, boss. The aquarium fish will be happy. Saves conclusions for later and bring those pictures. I do not understand, Commissioner. So much for little Hannes? He would not kill a fly. We'll see ... Mr. Mibauer. Sit down. - Lako. - Hannes. We need to find him, either way. Why so? Seems to be an alley with no exit, There's nothing in these. Do you have any friend in Dortmund? - Yes, I do. We wanted to go and party with Borussia. (Borussia Dortmund is a Football Team) I cannot believe he is gone. You can go. What's the hurry? Mibauer sir, do accompany me in an inspection of Hannes' floor! Saturday, 3:30. There are no more excuses! Lothar. Now we know Hannes does not do football. RAILWAY CONTEST ROUTES hmmm... You are not needed, you can leave now. Lothar... You are a good friend. Harry, I know where Weber's gone : Finland. Not until we go there. Things are still unclear. Inform all borders, especially boundaries of the north. I'll call you. Once I have something. Hide! - Why? Do it now, I'll explain later. Where were you? - A passenger was ill. As you should already know, discrepancy in tickets could have consequences, disciplinary! I know. According to the record, there are two free booths. Do you want to check them? - Of course. Good night Mr. Heine. Motherfucker! Get me out of here. The coast is clear. Passports, please. Is there anyone here? Excuse me, one of the passengers fell ill and ... Have you seen this man? No. You're a slimy asshole! And you're clever fucker! Harry, it's me. I know it's late. I need an expert in Train Timetables by morning. And all the connecting trains too, on a CD. No, I'm still here. For Budapest, Venice and Barcelona 38 Hours. - Are you on vacation? Do you dread return journeys? If I'd my way, I'd never take a train. Takes bloody long. I'm going to Maggeroy, in northern Norway, a place that nobody knows although many have passed by, but do not remember. - I assure you I haven't been there. Karl Heinze. Pleasure. Beyond this island of North Cape. People do not realize how beautiful is Maggeroy. Just go to see that stupid hill. I've been several times, but I travel by different routes. The last time two years ago, I took the mail boat. And you, where are you headed? - Me? Inari. Inari... Yes, participting in a championship held there. Lake Inari ... You know it? No. Pearl of Finnish lakes. Been there several times. The northernmost lake in the world. What a feeling, man! Sitting under the autumn sun on shores of Lake Inari ... Silence ... The endless tranquillity, birch ... Emerging majestically from the heart of dark waters of the lake, the towering hills... the sacred island of Ukonkivi. You take ten percent. But I thought ... - Quiet, standard rate. You've passed the test. Continue the good work, I'll telephone and inform you of the next delivery, soon. Finland is the last European frontier. - Sorry, I have to ... Nowhere else can be seen geological deformations of the Ice Ages! I used to be a geologist, you know? Not now. - Why? Now, no! Do me a favor. Watch this case. I'll be back in five minutes. Good evening?. Hello. - Are you the conductor? Want a new phone card? No, but I fancy a coffee. I'm all out of coffee now, Do you want a beer? I am a friend of the conductor. You left this in the IC. I think I'm going to give it away. Have you been to Finland? I am Finnish! And would you give me directions to Inari? - Inari? Yes, I have to go there. You know the place? - I know it rather well. Have a schedule of Finnish trains? - Yes, but not here, is in my bunk. Excuse me ... - Give us minute! Hannes, this is not a place ... - Go and see if the old man wants another beer. Good-bye. - No. Hey wait! What's wrong with you? Who was that? - A Finnish chick with a Finnish Timetable! I gave her a beer. - Did she pay? What's in that bag? Where is it? Come on, Hannes, where is it? - What will you give me? Let's talk then. Look man, we're friends now. You mind your own business and I do mine. Okay? You too have business in Sweden? Hamburg police. I don't have anything to do with this. It is true. I have not done anything wrong in my life. We'll check. I'm taking you back to Hamburg. I have to get to Inari! That is not an option. You should choose friends with care. Have you actually been to Inari? Is it really so nice? - Yes. But I always go by plane. While you associate with hooligans on trains... I fish in the lakes. Pocket Schedule Finnish trains. Eventhough the CD contains all European routes... catalogued to the smallest local city ... Mr. Schroeder, you tell me the quickest route to Inari! ... we must take into account certain theoretical aspects. The schedules are very easy to understand, but the shortest route is not always is the fastest, depending on connecting trains. For example... If we go from Stockholm to northern Sweden ... We must make the change at Bodell. Ya. Eurocity from Hamburg, the train is arriving on platform 3. One first class ticket to Turku, Finland. The single cabin costs 600 markkas. Got news about Weber. Hamburg police have questioned Johannes in connection with counterfeiters. Johannes? - Yes, in Eurocity Hamburg-Stockholm. Unfortunately he escaped before he was brought back to Hamburg. Are they idiots? Do you think he was in league with these counterfeiters? "Crime and Punishment" Are you still traveling? Good to see you. Me, too. Have you had dinner? Me neither. I would like to invite you to dinner. Well, first I would like to... Me too. What is the best time of the year in Finland? Autumn, when you see the forest embraced by all colors. Once it's starts snowing, the sunsets become increasingly dark, and everything becomes more and more silent, until a time comes without shadows. You mean when it's night all the time? - No. Eternal darkness! Eternal darkness? Quite a horror. Yes, weighs heavily on the soul. And the same happens in Inari? - Yes. Inari is the end of the world. It's where you want to go. - As fast as possible. In a hurry? - I must be there by day after tomorrow. Have a date? - Yes, in a sense. I want to participate in a tournament. - In Lapland? What do you want to win? First prize: Best expert in train schedules! And what makes someone the best? Well... one who knows the fastest routes. That's odd. - What's so odd about it? B'cos the prize depends on the fastest routes. What else do you reckon? - I always look for the best route. The best is always the fastest. What train are you taking tomorrow? The Ioenshu from 8:24, changing at 10:12 in Tampere, to catch the 11.00 Keniarvi. So you get to Inari at night. Do you really want to get somewhere unknown at such an hour? The best route to Inari, it is through the north of Sweden. By Haparanda. I'd have to spend the night. When I travel I want to travel fast and get there fast. You got lots to do? I have to be quick, I want to be fast. I prefer to enjoy the journey. What do you mean? With the high-speed train I would save time, but what would I get to feel and see? No houses, no people, no scenery. I do not want to waste time. Do you think the time is yours? Earlier you arrive, more time to use. If I'm the fastest, I win. What will you win with that? ?25,000. You see... time is money. And is that all you dream about? Dreams? -uhmm... At the moment I Just want to win the championship. Maybe I can make it into a profession. Railway Expert! Railway expert of the European Union!! Want to save time for Europeans? That's exactly what I mean! Brussels is developing an European High-Speed Train Network. ICE, TGV, AVE... London to Naples Athens to Stockholm Lisbon to Moscow, All the systems could be bettered. I could develop a concept more efficient, I have very innovative ideas. And you, what do you dream? To start a rose plantation in Seinajoki. Seinajoki! Why roses? They are beautiful. What's stopping you? Koktalo. Fate. Since childhood I have been passionate about roses. My grandmother always took care of her roses with great care. Since then I have dreamed to dedicate my life to grow roses. Now I would like to move to the old farm of my grandparents. Breakfast together? In the cafeteria. Seven and a half. The secretary has rented a room in Ischia, but had no reservation. There... What did you say? - Via boat. Care to explain what you mean? I think I've got him figured out. Train route to Finland is extremely time consuming, forces you to spend the night in Haparanda. And Hannes would not want to. Stefan, I don't quite follow. Hannes knows the fastest routes and fastest to northern Finland is via ferry from Stockholm. We'll catch that ferry when it arrives in Finland tomorrow and arrest him. We must inform the Finnish. - Send a fax. This time... we will be faster. Ladies and gentlemen. We are about to arrive in Turku, where you can, if you wish, buy your tickets for connecting trains bound for Helsinki and Tampere. What kind of idiot would come to Finland to escape the German police? Only an asshole! Not even an asshole! Good morning. Good morning. I forgot to change the time. Sorry. May I? Hey, would you like to join me? Where? - In Inari. Not possible. Please come, be my guest from this moment. Frankly... I don't know. Tickets, please. Remember to dispose the tray off in the restaurant car. Next stop, Pasila, after that, Helsinki. Stopping at Pasila. Next, Helsinki. "Good luck. Sirpa." Stefan, the coroner says there is no doubt that Lifke fell twice. Maybe it was someone else who ... Harry, speed is what we need now. Look, I tried to reconstruct the crime and... We need to be faster, but better. Do you understand? - No. I'm gonna change to a new strategy. Book me on the next flight to Helsinki. Stefan, we are homicide. And train tickets from Helsinki north of Finland. Hi, love: I've booked a table for us at Boheme for 9pm. I may come a little late. This is the voice of Pauli Hakinen, computer programmer, and Sirpa Salonen. Leave a message and I'll call you. Hello, love. We'll have to postpone our reunion. Sorry baby I can't dine with you at Boheme. The bed below is mine. Bed 13 in compartment 6 is mine. Mine too. Berth 13, Box 6, the booth section. There's been a mistake. Check with the conductor. I booked seven weeks ago! Check my ticket, please. There must be some mistake. Stay here. - Thank you. You're welcome. You know this man? To get to Inari, do I to change at Rovaniemi? "Rovaniemi: The door to the north" One beer please No beer. Just one bottle. It has been finalized. Fuck! Well, welcome to Finland. Cheers. Cheers. My wife grives a bulldozer. he is Lappish, but working now in Rovaniemi. You only have 23 minutes. Yes, I know. Two beers! "Keep going." "Get to your destination."

Eino Gr?n performing "S? kuulut p?iv??n jokaiseen" ("You Belong in Everyday") You belong in everyday, you belong in the morning and evening Are In my first thoughts, you occupy my final ones too You belong in the sunrise, and in our union on the moonlit bridge Are in the glowing sunrise morning dew, in the melody of singing little birds Train from Helsinki is arriving on Platform No.2. Do you know how to get Inari? I'm lost! I was told that this is the most beautiful place on earth. Have you heard of the sacred island of Ukonkivi? My grandmother told me about it when I was little. When a young Lapp wants to marry, He must spend seven days alone on that island. The suitor isn't allowed to take any food with him. He had to prove that he was able enough to provide for an entire family. The bride didn't have to prove anything? The seventh day, the bride had to get to the island without being noticed by the groom, and bring him a roast reindeer. The young man then had to search her. After that they climbed on the highest hill to seal their union with their very first kiss! Above all, alone with the lake. Is it a true story? I do not know. Your grandmother would disapprove of me greatly! Can we see the hill from here? You have to go furthet into the lake. Will you let me invite you for some tea? When I finish the contest I'll buy you a greenhouse in Seinajoki. Hannes Weber?? Dortmund Homicide. You're charged with... Murder. What? Your boss in Dortmund is dead. I must take you back. - I just, punched him! It is impossible. He is not a murderer. I have to participate... Just two hours. and can go straight from Turkey to Baghdad. but trains are always delayed. Great! Will give the good news to Weber! No confession yet? What do you mean you're at it? Homicide or murder, it's up to the judge. I want the Secretary's signed confession on my desk. When I come, I just want to close the case. Not yet: I have some unfinished business. Hannes, I'll come and see you. Can I have the timetables back please? Now forget about me. And do not regret Haparanda. Good luck. Both of you.
