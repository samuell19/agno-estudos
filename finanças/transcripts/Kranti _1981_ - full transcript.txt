You said that if I come here tonight, you'd know I'm ready. - Yes. You're ready all right. - What am I ready for? For these fieIds, this motherIand, Whom the British have raped. I don't understand. These fieIds were ours once so was this Iand, which we fiIIed... as we sang patriotic songs. - Today, nothing beIongs to us. - Neither the songs, nor the fieIds. - Meaning. Listen carefuIIy, son. This saga begins, then... when the British were advancing Iike a horrifying shadow... with the intention to seize the whoIe of India in their cIutches. But to be abIe to do that, it was vitaI that they capture Ramgadh. The king here Ioves India more than his own kingdom. He doesn't know that if we bombard, his kingdom wiII be reduced to ashes! Don't worry about the king, sir. His younger brother wiII be present. - But how? - Shambhu Singh wiII bring him! Shambhu's brain is Iike a doubIe-edged sharp sword. I swear, if I don't make you the ruIer of this kingdom... .. I'II eat my hat! - How? See to the needs of the British through your brother, the king. Our needs wiII be seen to by Sir Thomas. Now Iisten. You heIp us, and we'II heIp you. Understand? Or need I expIain? I've a very sharp brain. Tomorrow the king wiII be convinced by his brother, to Iisten to you. - WeII dear brother? - WeII... I... My brother has done a bad deaI. But I'II see that you keep your word. TeII the British, that I agree, to Iet them use our port for some years. But on one condition. The British ships wiII not carry expIosives! Sire, give this Goddess's shawI to Sanga. It'II protect his famiIy. Sanga, your ancestors must have really served this HoIy Mother. For, the pIace you hoId at her feet, is neither my famiIies nor mine. HoIy Priest, there is my sister. God gave her 3 chances to become a mother, but in vein. This time she has hopes yet again, eIse her husband wiII wed again. Have faith in the HoIy Mother, Sire. By Her grace... sinners Iike me got kids. ComparativeIy you are... You are the king, and we are... mere farmers, who tiII the Iand. - Hey, see this. - What is it? See this. O God! There are expIosives. The ships are fuII of expIosives. Dynamite. You'II have to compensate for this. - We've to unIoad the ship. Before allowing the use of this post, the king had put a condition. That no British ship wiII carry any kind of expIosives. - You are to just obey the king. - It's our duty to protect his order. - Against the Indians? - Sanga! Your Majesty! The British haven't obeyed your orders. They are betraying you. ExpIosives are being unIoaded on the docks, when you had decided... it wiII not be so. This is meaningIess, Sire. It has to be stopped. I swear, your Majesty... Somebody has... murdered our King. Not ''Somebody'' : You've murdered him! I swear by the HoIy Mother, I didn't murder him. You can save yourseIf from this horribIe death. According to the Iaw of the reaIm, the RoyaI Court wiII decide my fate. You'II say what I teII you to say, in the Court. What if this boon from the Goddess is fIung down from here? Your wife is carrying another boon from the Goddess. Fear Her wrath! In front of you all, Sanga accepts that his hands... are red with the king's bIood. - That's a Iie! Not my hands, but my souI is spIattered with Sire's bIood. Now, our new king wiII Iet you know his decision. According to the Iaw made by the Iate king... I sentence you to death. SoIdiers! Today, there's a ceIebration in the whoIe kingdom. Go! Eat, drink and be merry. Go now. Sir! I feeI Iike presenting your Indian bIood to this miracIe by the British. But no! Why shouId I kiII the one who's going to be hanged? It's my duty to obey, the Iaw of the reaIm! Learn how to do your duty, from a dog. Even a dog protects its master. You soId your MotherIand! If it wasn't the traitor ... no Iand wouId ever be compromised. That's all over now, Sanga. Now think about spending the night. Tomorrow morning you wiII be hanged. The first ray of tomorrows sun, wiII throttIe your Iast breath! ''What if this boon from the Goddess is fIung down from here?'' Isn't this that hand... which was raised on the bIessing of the Goddess? KiII him! KiII him, I say! SoIdiers! Catch him! Let him not escape. TeII His Majesty, that Sanga is dead! CongratuIations! It's the father who's congratuIated. Where is he? Where the heII is he? I wonder what God is made of? He took Sanga's Iife with one hand... and gave his wife a son with the other. Bhima... It's vitaI that we all Ieave this reaIm now. That too today itseIf! You were running away from here. You're traitors! And now, you'II have to become our sIaves. A sIave that is young is weIcomed. The kids and the aged are useIess. Shoot the aged and the kids, one by one. - No! Don't kiII my chiId... - Mummy! SoIdiers! Search and find her kid and kiII it! She must be here somewhere. Find her. KiII her baby. O HoIy Mother, protect him. The sea drowns the Iiving, and discards it as a corpse! God, if anyone comes to know, that she's had a stiIIborn chiId... Sanga! It's Sanga's chiId. He and his whoIe famiIy is dead. The Goddess has sent this chiId for Charumati, no doubt. Go and teII everybody that Charumati has given birth to a prince. Sanga and his famiIy are all dead. Why famiIy? This IittIe prince Iives. We'II bring him up with our chiId. But what is his name? Sanga had said, they'd christen him next year, and name him '' Bharat'' My wife and kids, Bhima, and my other friends... did the Brits kiII them all? - Yes, sir. He isn't pretending to be dead Iike me, is he? Seize that ship! - Yes, sir. The murderous merchants pIy the sea... They'II have to face us, when they come and go! We'II swear by this Indian bIood. We'II write the word ''RevoIution'' with it, across the sky! We'II write ''RebeIIion''. With the tide of time, the revoIt forged ahead. all the ships that came and went had to confront us. As time passed, this embIem of Kranti... become a sign of freedom struggIe. The worId came to know Sanga as a revoIutionary Ieader. - It's happened again, Captain. - What's happened? Another rebeIIion against the British tyranny. He has put a seaI... on the crueI British. A seaI just Iike our embIem. Sir, this is going on for some time now. Who is this person... who is using a seaI just Iike our embIem? Who can it be? When Iife runs at a fast pace, so does the bIood in one's veins. He who rebeIs, whoever or wherever he may be, is one of us. Dear friends, Karim Khan is that man, who... after the Rani of Jhansi became a martyr, took revenge. But aIas, after coming to this pIace he was caught by the EngIish. It's decIared that he'II be bIown to smithereens by a cannon tomorrow. But we'II not Iet this happen. - But, sir, we mustn't forget... that the Brits have cannons. - If they have cannons,... we have brave Indian chests too. Long Iive the revoIution. My dear... Father, ask her. We're all prepared for tomorrow. You coward! A deserter! Do you have anything to say finally? I swear by the soiI in which I shall be buried in the end. As Iong as there'II be atrocities done by the British in India... ... many rebeIs Iike me, shall be born here. Commander! BIow him to pieces, this very moment! Long Iive the king! My foot! Before praising the king, who Iikes the shoes of the Brits... you all shouId kiII yourseIves! Forgive us, Sire we're a bit Iate. - Hasn't the priest come himseIf? He has fever. He asked me to hurry over here... ... 'cos you don't start anything without the Goddess's bIessings. And today's program is very vitaI, Sire. All due to HoIy Mother's grace. Hail, HoIy Mother. The destroyer of sinners. Today the Mother has eyes onIy for you. A sinner wiII die today. Correct, Sire. - SoIdiers! Fire the cannon! Sire, you won't see such a day again. Meaning? By that... mean... since the Goddess is smiIing upon us, Iet's have prayers... before you go ahead with it. She wiII be more happy, and aIso... the atheist wiII know our true emotions. May I? - You may. Whose idoI is that? It's not of the HoIy Mother, but of Mother India. BIow Karim Khan to pieces! Fire the 2nd cannon! They've changed our gunpowder. My name is Bharat. PIace, Kishengadh. Come at any time. Whether Iand or sea, this man is putting his seaI everywhere. Sir Thomas, he wiII be arrested. - How? I've come to a decision. I'II change my Commander! - The new Commander of your army... Who wiII it be, Sire? - His own son, Prince... No! My new Commander wiII be my sister's onIy son, Shakti. I'm sure my new Commander's first assignment wiII be... the arrest of that traitor. - It's my duty to obey the king. It's against the Iaw of the Iand to appoint an officer before testing him. Prince! What Iaw do you mean? - Sire... On one side, the contender, and, on the other side... his mother. And between them, a rotating fish! - Then? Then, the contender wiII target the rotating fish's eye, bIindfoIded. If he misses the eye, then the arrow wiII pierce his mother's heart. This mother's heart. Shakti has never feared a challenge. Nor wiII he make a deaI. - What? Your challenge smeIIs of a deaI. And I won't risk mother's Iife to become a commander. My son wiII target the eye of the rotating fish. Mother! - Order for that fish, Sire. You missed your target. My first arrow is paying my respects... at my Mother's feet! Now it's the turn of the fish's eye. Commander Shakti... - Hosanna! Tomorrow father wiII make him the king! If I intended that... then, after her widowhood, I wouIdn't have merged... her reaIm with my own, so very shrewdIy. Him becoming a commander wiII shut their mouths forever. And me? What do you mean? With me as your uncIe, why do you worry? Shakti wiII wieId the sword, and you'II ruIe. Not just your reaIm... but the one next door too! - How? The King of Shivpur... has offered his daughter's hand in marriage to you. The Princess? Now do you understand? Now go. Be prepared to weIcome them. The Princess is expected here tomorrow morning. Be carefuI, Your Highness. Your Highness... you're not hurt, are you? Are these horses - or asses? Asses! - Indeed! Princess, the wheeI's broken. - SoIdiers, put up a tent for me. And get somebody to repair the wheeI. I'II go ahead onIy in this. And you! Go wash your bIack face with water. O daughter of the priest... - My name is SheetaI. Whatever. You are the priest's daughter. - What do you want? TeII you father to say the vows and get me married. To whom? Bharat? ShameIess girI, you take his name? - Am I his fianc?e or something... to feeI shy to take his name? - True. It's I who shouId feeI shy. I, who couIdn't teII him anything because of it. Then Iet me. Bharat, the fire of your Iove has enguIfed this girI here. Then Iet me douse it. Who are you? - Darmiyan Singh. A fire-dowser. Greetings. - Greetings, indeed! Here, Sir. - Go and get the soIdiers. My men wiII not spare you now. Princess! See what the bandits did. They kiIIed nearIy all our men. I'II shoot them! Where are they? - Do you have the strength to shoot? Before he dies, ask him, who's the reaI bandit! I'm not used to hearing crap! - And I'm used to teaching manners. There goes your dog! - Be poIite. Be my captive, you'II be poIite too. Where's the Princess? Get out of my way. - I never give way to anyone. I throw others out of my way! Because the Princess is missing, they've begun to burn the viIIages. The princess wiII go to the paIace, but it'II be Suresh who'II go. - Get ready, SureIi. - Me? Don't get worried. They don't know you, and neither do they know the reaI princes here. She has just come from EngIand. - I meant her etiquette's and styIe... Manners and styIe? TaIk rudeIy, treat peopIe sub-humanIy... you'II automatically become the princess here! A prince on a wooden horse? - Not a wooden horse, but a bicycIe. It was sent from London, especially for me. Guard! Who is it? It? Which ass dared to call me 'it'? Who are you? You must be this ass's father not to know me! Princess, your anger is just. - My anger isn't so IowIy. It's aIways just! Understand? She's very rude, dear brother. - After marriage her reaIm is ours. Then I'II teach her poIiteness! TiII then, endure whatever she does. Go weIcome her. Bow before the British, eIse you'II be whipped as usuaI. I'II faint after being whipped as usuaI. But I won't die! An Indian sword is good enough for an EngIish gun! Captain... I've painted their faces bIack, to match their bIack minds! Throw this brute at the paIace door, so that he can teII his peopIe... if even an Indian is subjected to brutality, then this sword... From today, you're all free... Long Iive Kranti. Had you got hurt whiIe trying to save me, then? Then what? Whoever, wherever your mother is, what do I teII her? And had you got wounded, then whoever, wherever your son is... what wouId I have toId him? - Son... Captain! Let's go. - Right then. I'II go now. Son, you didn't teII me your name. - My name, my fame, ''RevoIution''. She's that woman Radha, who knows everything about that man Kranti. Where does he Iive? His address. - From today he Iives in my heart. My souI. - I can shake your souI. But you can't break it! You oId hag! - Yes, my son? Raise your hand and whip me! This is Mother. HoIy Mother. Not a princess reared on sins! I'm a princess! - Your food. I'm no animaI to eat this! Go throw them at your captain's feet! Those who insuIt food Iike this, don't even deserve a doggie bag! What the heII do you want? Ornaments? Here take these! Bharat... - Any news? SureIi has sent a message... that our priceIess gems, jeweIry, and antique idoIs... wiII be Ioaded on a ship. Loaded! And that ship, with all those priceIess things... wiII go to EngIand. The same way as once, another ship... had taken out Kohinoor diamond from India. Be prepared! Even if you're successfuI as usuaI this time too, so what? Where wiII those things go? Who'II take the gems? A thief. A bandit? Where does that stuff go to, for which you kiII peopIe? This rebeIIion, this revoIution, is just a mask you and your paIs wear! A weak souI weakens the eyes too. If you wish to see reality behind that mask... then come upstairs with me! Sonu here used to weave ''MuImuI..'' whoIe roII used to pass through a small ring easiIy. But the Brits... The British did this to him! They didn't cut just his hands... They severed the Indian artistry! This farmer used to tiII his Iand. The fIoods came and ruined it. He couIdn't pay his Iand-rent, so he went to seek mercy Iegally. So? - They did what the Brits do usually. They pierced his eyes with hot pokers and made him bIind! This woman, as per our tradition, wanted to die on her husband's pyre. The Brits removed her from the pyre, and that night... God knows how many soIdiers gang-raped her! Such atrocities on our peopIe. On our Iand. And I don't know it! I pity you peopIe! Your souI and emotions are all tainted! We're all ready to go, brother. Okay then, Princess. We Iooters are off to Ioot. Because to spark off a rebeIIion, one needs body, mind and money too! Who are you? - What do I Iook Iike? What you are! - Then why ask? Do you know the penaIty to stop me Iike this? May be you don't know the price to set foot on my Iand. Does your father cross this road? - No, but yours does! And he had Iooked upon me as a son, and said... ''Son protect your mother''. - SoiI is mother to everyone. Then we're sons of the same mother. My soIdiers can Iop your head off! God hoIds the pen that writes our fate. Let's see what resuIt he pens of our meeting today. I write my fate with my sword. - And to aIter that is my daily chore. And hear this too. Those priceIess things you have in your carts... wiII not go to EngIand. The Commander's army has run away! Captain! - What news do you bring? Tomorrow a ship carrying prisoners of revoIution are to be exiIed! We'II turn this sea red with bIood, but we'II not Iet those men be exiIed. Tomorrow our ship wiII confront the ships of those foreigners! What do you want? - ReIease of the freedom fighters. Whom you want to exiIe. - We'II have you exiIed too! To arrest a revoIution that has stood up to many storms. Is not for cowards Iike you! The revoIution demands freedom. Set our countrymen free. Did you hear that? - You'II get your men. ReIease them! You can go one by one. Wait! Between our cannons, are your own countrymen. Don't bother about us. Just bIow up these enemy boats. Put him in the boat with women and kids and Iet him go. Why him? He'II be branded with my seaI which he'II show to the worId. He has made our Iives miserabIe. - Our commander wiII arrest him soon. Kranti wiII not be caught, tiII the farmers here,... the Iaborers here and the common man, doesn't hate him! Divide and ruIe! I mean, if you don't understand... You know very weII, sir, that, my brain is a doubIe-edged sword! No! Let me go! No! Let me go! No! No! I've made you a woman. You shouId be gratefuI to me! The priest is dead! That too with Kranti's knife! I've done all the damage and peopIe wiII bIame Kranti! He himseIf wiII not beIieve, that this is possibIe too! This can't happen! - It has, captain. It's a fact. The one we regarded as someone. Like you, is a marauder! No! Yes! He Iooted poor farmers houses Burnt their fieIds. That Iecher raped innocent girIs. - Shut up! My strong beIief, my confidence, turned out to be so horribIe... so crueI. It feeIs as though... my body... My body has betrayed my souI! Has betrayed me! The dirty and obnoxious hands that... touched this hoIy torch... wiII be destroyed, I swear! Who are you? - A traveIer. TraveIer? This is a tavern, not a stabIe! What do you want? No... Better go. Now, teII me. What do you want? - A room to stay. And some one who'II buy this stuff. Do you understand what I mean? Kranti, that too in that tavern? How do we know it's him? His seaI, sir. Kranti wiII have to face me! - He wants to make a deaI. But in private. - Then teII him... to come behind the oId tempIe. My first strike is as my respects to that Kranti, who's dead. My first strike is as a bIessing to that Kranti, who's dead. That Kranti is dead! He who, at one time... seized storms in his fist! He's dead! He's dead too, for whom I sent countIess prayers in the waves. I was proud that even if I die, there was someone who'd take... .. the torch of revoIution further. But, damn it! Damn it! The one who roused my hopes... is himseIf dead! He's dead... It's he who's dead, whom I worshiped before even God AImighty! He! Who once protected this very Iand. You dare! You dare taIk of motherIand! If this Iand is stiII hoIy to you... then why the atrocities? Every atrocity wiII be paid for! You've done atrocities on the poor farmers and you'II be punished. A Iie! You raped innocent girIs and you'II be punished. Shut up! We were waiting for this confrontation for years now! He may be Kranti, or not. But, for me he's a bigger catch! Sire, he's the same man, who kiIIed your brother, Laxman Singh. He's the same man... who severed my hand! I didn't get a chance. EIse I'd have cut your head! Neck? That too mine? Oh no... See? See the power of my Ieft hand? It's made of iron now! Howre you concerned with Kranti? - As a soIdier is to revoIution! So! You're a traitor! - Yes. I'm a traitor. So you admit your offence! - Yes, I am an offender... But not yours. My motherIand's. An offender of this great nation. Whose every grain of sand challenges my conscience, and says. ''Shame on you! Shame that you haven't thrown out these swines! CouIdn't avenge your king's death as yet. CouIdn't avenge the death... ... of those innocent babies who had suffocated in their mother's wombs. What babes? Whose death? Whom are you taIking about? The begums, the daughters and the daughters-in-Iaw of the poor... the decent veiIed women, that's whom I'm taIking about. Who were puIIed in market squares by these foreign brutes... and made victims of their Iust by these Iechers! Those who destroyed our tempIes and vandalized our mosques. And this viIe sin just to crush our decency and to ruIe this nation. This bIack man teIIs a white Iie! - And these whites, do bIack deeds! Let aIone men, their women too stoIe the ornaments from our dead! They've ripped off ear-rings from our dainty daughters. They've severed hands from which they couIdn't remove the bangIes! They had their arms cut off, But today I'II Iop your head off! If I die, thousands wiII be born! - Anything eIse you wish to say? To Hastings. Our rebeIIion wiII avenge each and every crueIty! Refer to him, as Lord Hastings! - He may be a Lord to you! But in the court of humanity he'II aIways be a rascaI! He's insuIting! - KiII him now. This moment! No, sir. Such a dangerous criminaI wiII not be kiIIed so easiIy... in fact he'II be tortured to death. If you're one, why fight each other? - If the one who incites asks this... what can I say? - Just remember this. That tyranny and Iies bear fruit just once. Never the 2nd time! We were after one and found two! - One was more than enough for you... Two wiII finish you off! - What did you say? TeII us about your co-workers, I'II see that you become rich! See the shine on it! Just name your feIIow workers. This wiII all be yours! - Wish to buy man by seIIing God! TeII me, is the deaI on? Take him away. You'II get so tired hanging Iike this, that one of you wiII Iean. The one who sIeeps wiII sureIy die, but he'II kiII the other one too. One is feeIing drowsy and he'II sIeep now. Then both wiII die! Munna! - Did you call? Forgive me... After so many years... I don't know how... I remembered my son.... I feIt as though he was with me. And I was... gentIy putting him to sIeep. And I too feIt sIeepy. - Where is your son? On the path of revoIution. And that young man? He's my son. - And what about me? You? - Yes. You're the IittIe master. Sergeant! Punish them for taIking. Whip them! We'II have to attack tonight. My captain is captured in there. If your master is in there, mine is aIso rotting in there! But the foe is so strong and shrewd that it's impossibIe to free them! Then how wiII we free them? - By feeding gram to the enemy! Gram? How wiII they heIp? - Drugged gram, to knock them out! Who are you? - A gram-seIIer, sir. And you? - A Iady gram-seIIer! Indeed! - Name is SureIi. SureIi, my IittIe gram-seIIer, eh? I sing. - And I pIay. And seII this gram to peopIe. - Cos our gram is not just gram. It's warm and Ioving. - And a friend among friends. Come on, dear sir. - My dear, your gram has pierced... my heart Iike a buIIet! - WeII then, if you Iet me of course... before I present this gram, may I sing its other qualities too? Yes, go ahead. No! - Princess! Do you... Do you know this man? Come on men! FoIIow me. I've some bad news, Princess. - What? Your father was stupid enough... to revoIt against the British. Then, your P.M. was made the king. I'm very sorry to say this, but your father was then kiIIed. Who says my father is dead? Who dares to say such a thing? My, father... My father is immortaI! My father is immortaI! - Your Highness! PIease get up. Don't touch me! - Princesses don't cry Iike this. You're right! RoyaIty doesn't wail Iike this. Long Iive the RevoIution. Don't worry. You're precious to us. - ReIax now, whiIe we go back. But this carriage wiII have to be moved from here. Okay. Be carefuI, sir. Princess. - She died months ago. I'm just Minakshi now. A soIdier under a captain. A wife of a man. - Really? - Men put vermiIion... in a girI's hair-parting and wed her. But I've put your bIood from the hoIy embIem of our revoIt in mine. If you don't beIieve me, I'II swear before God that I've married you. You don't know it. But there's danger at every step that I take. That's why I've chosen you as my husband. I... swear by the revoIt, that you can't accept me as your wife. How can I Iie? But my dear... by becoming emotionaI you've put your Iife at a stake. My one step means Iife, and the next means, death! Short or Iong, Iife is Iife. - Meaning? I'II just go to the Iake and bathe. Hey, he's sIeeping again? This beIongs to them. - I've toId you, nobody has come here. If he doesn't taIk by the time I count up to 5, shoot them! It's me whom you want, right? WeII, I've come. Stop! Sir Thomas has ordered that the prisoners be sent to the ship. We need sIaves to pIy the oars. Water! Water! No! Give it to our Captain First. - Stop! He'II not get any water! - He wiII get water! Here, drink this. You oId hag! - Yes, my son? Her punishment, sir? It's vitaI to take the sIaves to the ship. What are you waiting for? Hurry up and go down. Hurry! Come on! My name is Sher Singh. Why are you standing here? - I'II not row! I've seen many things in my Iife which soiI do you beIong to? He... beIongs to that soiI, which your ancestors worshiped! What! What did you say? - You heard me! That... That he'II row too. Yes. He'II row too. Come up! - Coming Madam. It's my duty to pamper you aIong with your Madam too Hey you! It's your duty to cIean here and give water beIow too. Didn't I teII you thee's danger at each and every step I take? You're thirsty. Have some water. You bitch! Water is given to the sIaves, not boy friends! Go upstairs. I'II report you. Come on... After the first defeat in the war, when a handfuI of soIdiers remained. with their queen, the Queen of Jhansi. Do you know what they thought of at that time? What? Let there be a war... the EngIish wiII remember! - There wiII be such a war, Karim. We'II stay on this Iand and hoist a fIag of revoIution Iike he did. Who, sir? He, whose name makes us Iook up with pride. Who brings tears to one's eyes. when he's remembered. Does Kranti become heIpIess being shackIed Iike this? When wiII that was take pIace? - Soon. When, I say! When! WiII our freedom fighters rot and die? WiII we row for the rest of our Iives? WiII our dreams never be fuIfiIIed? When wiII we fight that war? When? Take it easy, Karim. ControI yourseIf. Now endurance itseIf is teIIing me, that it has no strength. So revoIt! Bastards! You taIk of revoIt? I'II skin you alive! You Iap dog of the Brits, hit me! Hit me harder, you rat! Go ahead and whip me... What had you said about the Queen of Jhansi? She had said,... Let there be a war, the British wiII never forget! Understand? You? - Yes, me! You cur, I'II kiII you today. Shut up! - Bastard! You strike a girI? If you're a man, then open these! Then see if you don't die Iike a rat! I'II deaI with you Iater, but first Iet me see to this sIut here! You speak EngIish? And you Iick the shoes of those who do! If there's an iota of shame in you, you'II apoIogize to these men. I shouId say sorry to these peopIe? To these Indians? I'm a bastard? Yes! That, and a rascaI and a cur! You're not onIy an insuIt to Rajputs but a stigma on all the Indians! This EngIish buIIet wiII hurt your Indian body very badIy! Water! - Nobody wiII get water. Shoot me, but I'II give him water. Get up, drink this water. He's dead! You curs, your friend is dead! Cry, weep. The heavens wiII mourn his death! The heavens shall weep, and we'II avenge his death! A sign of spring and harvest. This time the cIouds wiII rain bIood! Throw the corpse into the sea! You're an idiot! You're an ass! OnIy an expert knows a reaI gem. Such a IoveIy girI... is not meant for such chores. We EngIish don't do our personaI work, when in uniform Iater on. And what about your character? You seII your mother and sisters? You bitch! You abuse my character? I do viIe things, eh? No, my master wiII not Iike this fair skin to be marked. Send her up! - You Iecher! Fear God AImighty. If she refuses, send her Iove, and his friends, to kingdom come! Didn't you hear?

If anybody makes a move, your master wiII drop dead here. You've shared bread with us. That bread was Indian! You bite the hand that feeds you? Row the boat! How are you, Commander? Your desertion was a Ioad on my head. It'II be Iighter today. - Head can separate from one's body. You've soId your inteIIect and your souI. And the one to bid for that, is a foreigner. The EngIish. I'm not used to Iistening to crap. - But you're good at doing it! Quiet! Whether a friend or a traitor. I respect vaIor! There! I stoop before you. now behead me. That Iuster in his eyes! It's puIIing at my heartstrings. Go! And ask yourseIf at Ieisure. And when you see the reality, then come and serve Kranti's fIag. We'II shape freedom together. Why did you do that? - What! He couId've easiIy kiIIed me today. The Commander has shot from behinds. First, those traitors wiII be kiIIed who, though Indian, betray India. These guns, they'II finish the EngIish, Iater on. But our first victim wiII be, Commander Shakti. What! Aunty is iII? - Yes. She wishes to meet you. AIone. What are you saying? I'm not the son of the woman who reared me? If you teII him you're his mother, do you know what'II happen? What? Today's prince, wiII become tomorrows street urchin! Take this. I've kept this cIoth carefuIIy ever since that day. I've seen its other haIf before. You want me to say that he's not my son? You'II have to! Your bioIogicaI mother, is that woman - sIave, Radha. You needn't do chores anymore. -I Iearnt to do the needfuI years ago. I must Ieave before Shakti comes. My son is alive! O HoIy Mother, he's alive! Your boon is Iiving! Just give me the strength... to keep away from him. Give me that strength, Mother. You've got your wish, mother. I've come to say something. - No! I don't wish to hear it. I came to say that, I'm not your son. If I had been your son, your hands wouIdn't be injured. Your eyes wouIdn't hoId tears. You... endured crueIty... and I kept on being crueI. I ate in priceIess crockery and you... starved and went without water. Shame on me! I've no reIation with you. - You mean... Don't... don't these 2 pieces from the mother's shawI prove I'm your son? Keep Her as witness and say, that you're not my mother. No! I can't Iie in Her presence I... I'm your mother. I'm realiy your mother. - Oh mom! Now my pIace isn't in the paIace from today, my worId is at your feet. Get Iost! - Seize this traitor! Mohan! - Yes, Sir? Hang this traitor! If I've the guts to kiII, then, I've the strength to kiII myseIf too. I'II put this mere rope around my neck, myseIf! We can't hang him today. - Why not? Today is a hoIy day. Tonight we sing praises to our HoIy Mother. The HoIy Mother has saved this traitor today. But after visiting the tempIe, he'II be hanged. Visiting the tempIe? - Yes. It's been a Iong time now. You? Is it you? - Where's Munna? God know where the eIder one got Iost with Bhima. And... and the IittIe one, ... What? - Shakti. He was a commander... Commander? - Yes. After ali these years I found him yesterday. But Kranti abducted him! Captain! SoIdiers! Listen carefuIIy. I'II go now. But I'II met you tomorrow at this time. You seem happy. Naturaliy. The Goddess has bIessed us. We'II have a son. Come on. You! - Mother, how are you? The man you abducted yesterday. That Commander is my son. I want him back. I was saliing for days. Just Ianded here. - Liar! BeIieve me. - His abductors... Ieft Kranti's sign there. - Kranti's sign? I get it. What! Radha is alive? - Yes, she and Sanga met today. Isn't this the famiIy bIessed by the goddess? Shut up! This has to do with reIations. - Fraud! Trying to escape death, eh? Give the order, Sir. Tears, that too in your eyes? Why this weakness? Your Captain can never become weak. Those who betray this Iand... have no right to Iive on it! In my court every traitor is hanged. Death! Even if that traitor is my own son! I order you, Mohan, that commander Shakti... be reIeased. This cannot be. - It wiII be! Do you know my Iaws and reguIations are permanent? That promise to Kranti's soIdiers is permanent too. What promise? The one I gave Shakti's mother. What is she to you? - What is she to me? When I was in the jaws of death, That woman calied me ''son''. That's my reIation with her. - Kranti knows onIy justice. Before Kranti's court severs reIations, I'II destroy this court! I can kiII you for this. - Sure! Even I can kiII. It's not right to fight among ourseIves over this traitor! If he's not reIeased, we'II fight! - And if we fight, buIIets wiII fIy. The EngIish! - Yes! The EngIish! Commander, no traitor shali Iive. - Yes, I agree! Watch it! Commander, you aIso... - Yes! I'm an Indian too! Go back, men. What a nice man. Go away. You peopIe aIso go away. For Kranti's sake... SoIdiers! Let them not escape. Catch 'em! Your Commander's a traitor too, eh? Go and raid every Iane and viIIage. Imprison ali in the fort. What wiII you gain? The peopIe and the rebeIs are hand in gIove. So to save the rebeIs, the peopIe wiII attack the fort. And when they come, they won't be abIe to go out alive! And what if the rebeIs aren't caught? Then. We'II raze this reaIm! The peopIe here wiII die, no doubt. But the rest of India wiII burn too. Don't panic, if the EngIish over-power our ship on the sIy. How many foIIowers in Kishengadh? - About 8-10 thousand, sir. Then bring them here. Tonight, we attack the fort and the paIace! Right, sir. - Go! 10,000 revoIutionaries are enough to annihiIate many more traitors. Tomorrow, before sunrise, Kranti's fIag wiII fIutter on the fort. Tonight is a night to ceIebrate. Captain! It's ali over, sir. - What happened? The EngIish raided various pIaces, and arrested many of our men. And now their army is coming here. Let the women and kids be here. We'II return their attack with tooth and nali! You're the commander's reaI mother. - Yes! And Sanga's wife, eh? And you? - KiII me if you wish. But Iet her go. PIease. OId hag, you want to exchange your oId age with her youth? You rascaI! She's pregnant. - Oh I see. So she's aIso carrying the boon of the Goddess, eh? Yes I am! Sir! - What is it? Let aIone the IocaI rebeIIion... peopIe from nearby viIIages are aIso with revoIutionaries. When we raided their homes, most of them hid in the jungIes near by. Some died, yet others were caught. Where are they? - Open the doors. Long Iive, Kranti. What now? AIong with the others, Radha and Minakshi are caught too. We'II attack the fort. - We need a cannon to break the gate. Sir, here's the cannon, and some gunpowder too. This cannon is useIess. It's rusted. There are hoIes in it. It'II bIow up. No! This cannon wiII work and break the fort's door! But... I'm not Karim Khan if I can't gauge a cannon! Captain... I promise, the door wiII break! - But how wiII the cannon get there? The fort has a tight security. - You Ieave this to me now. When you reach the top of the fort, and signaI us with a torch... Karim wiII bIow that door. - But how wiII Shakti reach the fort? Shakti was a commander once, He's famiIiar to every secret passage. Come, dear Commander. You're most weIcome. You bastard! Don't you dare! Can't you see, your Prince's Iife is in danger? Drop your guns. Open the door! - Hurry and open the door. Friends, disarm the soIdiers! Yes Radha, your Munna. His name is Bharat a.k.a Kranti. My Bharat? My dear daughter I mean daughter-in-Iaw, Bharat Iives. Bharat is alive! Shakti, your eIder brother is alive. Yes, Mom. Did you hear that? He's alive. Take care of him properIy. Outside my friends are waiting for my signaI. I'II just come. Stop! The door is boIted both ways. It won't open, it'II break! You Iot go back! Go back! Why are you crying? - Cali him Sergeant. You fooI! I'm a Sergeant. - Right, sir. But Iook over there. What is it? Kranti's army. - Indeed! SoIdiers! Before they come forward, we'II go ahead and finish them off! These are just torches. Where is his army? Where is it? This must be a trap! - Trap indeed! Seize the guns from the curs! Where are you going, sir? - Karim has to bIow up the door. O God, heIp me. Stop! Let nobody move! SoIdiers, Iet nobody Ieave. Now start firing. You knew the cannon wouId bIow up. - The door had to break! I knew this cannon wouId break the door! Even the foe fuIfiIIs the Iast wish, you're Iike a brother... my captain. Won't you ask me? - Just teII me. The door has been broken. Save our friends now. Brother... God be... with you. Our friends wiII be saved, but, where wiII I find a friend Iike you? Sir! Listen. - Yes? A Iarge portion of their army... is going towards the hiII where they've set up a number of cannons. What! Not those cannons which wiII shower gunpowder ali over? I've Iearnt to siIence the cannons from you friend, go aIert others. You go to the fort, and I'II go to that hiII where the cannons rest. There, the British cannons are ready to shower gunpowder ali over... and here, death wiII ruIe ali over! Death! ali the peopIe inside, wiII die. And outside, their Ieader, Kranti. As soon as I Ieave, signaI the Brits to fire their cannons, with torches. Save yourseIves by standing against the walis. Go on! Where's Bhima? - He died Iong time ago. But, your son is alive. - Son? Yes. Bharat, a.k.a Kranti. I had toId Radha too. - Where is she and Minakshi? Shambhu has taken them both to the paIace by a secret path. SoIdiers! This voice beIongs to our king's brother who murdered him. I'II have to take revenge. - Right. I can tackIe them aIone. But.. - Go and protect your paIs. HeIp your brother, that's an order. Who kiIIed my soIdiers? TeII me, who murdered our king? Shakti... - Yes, brother? Brother? - Yes, brother! The one whom you Iook upon as mother, is realiy your own mother. We're both Sanga's sons. - Yes, it's true, son. Bhima's wife toId me. - Mom! Munna, O, Munna. Minakshi forced me to come here. And she stayed behind for your father. But where is he? - Don't worry about him. You and here? Why didn't you go with them? If I had Ieft you behind, how couId I have faced your son? But how did Shakti and Radha Ieave you aIone this condition? Death is ali around us. Let's go away from fire and embers. There must be a pIace, where the baby wiII be born peacefuIIy. Bharat was right. This soiI stops the bIood from fIowing. Look! The bIood has cIotted. I must go to Bharat. You find Minakshi. Radha! Take a Iook, wiII you? Minakshi... She's fine, isn't she? - Yes, everything's fine. A boy! If alive, come and face us! The cannons are siIent, the curs are dead too. You aIright? AbsoIuteIy. But why did you come? - You had once said... If this soiI heIps you to gain, then repay me some day. SiIIy! You've repaid your debt Iong back. Let's go now. Mother and father must be waiting. Come now. Listen. Our grandson Iooks exactIy Iike Bharat when he was born! Father! How shali I weIcome my captain today? By aliowing me to pay my respects. No, my son. Just give me a hug. - Father. My captain... what's this? BIood! - Yes father. Isn't this your bIood? Forget about the bIood now. The cannons are siIenced. We've won today's war, father. It's your crowning gIory, son. - No! No! Shakti has gone very far away from us, Iike Karim Khan. Martyrs are brave, son, your soIdier Shakti, was valiant. You shouId be proud of his sacrifice. Proud of him too! Father! Now go to your wife. Where is she? - In that cart. Go and see the sweet face of your son. Yes, Munna yes, Bharat. My dear captain, you're a father. My father has become a grandpa! CongratuIations! Your wife mustn't see this bIood. My wife wiII not see my bIood! BIess you. You're aIright, aren't you? - Yes, How are you? Fine, just fine. Don't worry. ali is weII, isn't it? - Yes. And it'II aIways be so. Take rest now, my dear. Just reIax. Mother! Father! Nothing wiII happen to you. Nothing! Whatever you've done, was for your country... for this soiI. It's time to go into the dust. - What nonsense! It's time for me to go in the dust. - Son, we got separated... we met again, and now you're going away again. Why, son? I'II aIways meet you, mom. I'II be re-born and meet you. Even If I meet you, how wiII I know it's you? Anyone with a buIIet hoIe in his chest,... or a mark of a noose round his neck.... Think that he's your son. Your Bharat. Won't you put this soiI on my forehead. Hali mother. Hali father! Tears? In your eyes? - They're not for the Ioss of my sons. They're out of pride, and honor for the immortality of an Indian soIdier. Yes, Kranti is immortaI. But, I'm aIone now. My man has Ieft me aIone and gone. No... This IittIe infant in your Iap is a proof for the fact... that my captain didn't Ieave you aIone. In his own pIace, he has given a soIdier. Another Kranti! I'II change him with. I'm sure the freedom which we couId not get, our Iineage wiII! What we couIdn't do, he wiII! Yes! Mummy, Grandpa I'II finish the job. Your soIdiers have ceIebrated your birthday, a bit too much! Who are you? What do you want? Revenge! - Whose? Not just my father's, but of every atrocity you committed on this nation. Atrocity, and me? No, no... Look, son, I don't want to mar my birthday by kiIIing somebody! You'II die on your birthday itseIf! I had vowed Shambhu. Son shali avenge his father! For every new traitor, a Kranti wiII be born. It's my soIemn oath. Now taIk. - Today's my birthday, chiId. My brain is as sharp as a doubIe-edged sword! No traitor wiII be spared! Kranti's Saga of freedom, continued in new forms and coIors.
