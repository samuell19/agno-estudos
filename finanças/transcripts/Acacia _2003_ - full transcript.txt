I bet it was tough being a judge. Seems like professor kim made it harder for you. No, i enjoyed it. Why didn't you give this painting a prize? It caused a stir. Even if he copied it, he's still very talented. I believe he had some help. But what if he had really done it all by himself? Then he might be a genius, and he'll be praised elsewhere. I made a portfolio collection. I'll go get it, so please wait here. Did you eat dinner? I ate with the students after the ceremony. - Where's dad? - Working in his workroom. - Want some tea? - Sure, i'll go change first. - Why are you giving me that look? - What look are you talking about? You've got something to say, so tell me. No, i'm just looking at how pretty you are. - Come on, tell me. - Lf you promise not to get mad at me. You're cheating on me and have a kid? - What? - Okay, you didn't, so no need to get upset. Just tell me. I won't get mad. What if we... - no, never mind. - What is it? Is it about a baby? About adopting a child? - How'd you know? - What else would you be so careful of? If it were a matter of cheating, you would've never brought it up. I'm not saying "let's adopt a child." I just want us to think about it. We can't really decide alone. Dad said he'll leave it up to us. You've already discussed it with him? It just came up during dinner. And frankly, i wanted to know how he felt about it. What's wrong? If you've decided already, why'd you beat around the bush? I guess it's settled. All you have to do is bring a kid home. Go right ahead. - Why are you acting like that? - What did i do wrong? All i have left to do is to raise a kid you and your father bring home. I'll just be a nanny. Great for you. Now you'll have someone to do your memorial ceremonies. Have a seat. - Working on a new project? - No. I was just going through my old works. I got a different feeling looking at them again. I guess i have affection for them. I always have. If you look at them affectionately, it's refreshing and gratifying... whether it's your work or not. How much you care about it is what matters... whether it's art or a person. I believe in both of you. You two will have more days... to spend with a child than me. Sorry to keep you waiting. Please sit down. You must have a specialized art teacher here. Pardon? No, we just let the children draw as they wish. Then did that child draw that tree on his own? He likes drawing so much. He always sits alone and draws. - Is this your first visit for an adoption? - Yes. Ma'am... may i see the child who drew that? What's this? There's a bug on the tree. Isn't he a little too old? It's strange. It feels like i've always waited for him. Isn't that more important? Jin-sung, you must really like trees. Mommy will help you. Lee jin-sung jin-sung, remember what i taught you. What's your new family name now? "Lee" jin-sung. How many times did i tell you that it's "kim" jin-sung? You're kim jin-sung, okay? Jin-sung. I'll knit you something nice, so stand up. Good boy. Now raise your head. The tree calls the ants. The ants protect the acacia tree. If animals or bugs bother it... the ants attack them and chase them away. It used to smell nice... and honey came out of the trunk. But a few years ago, for some reason... it stopped growing flowers and leaves. It's because that thing is hurting it. Then let's make it feel better. Can you go get the red toolbox from my workroom? It won't hurt anymore. You must be cold without leaves. I wish you had leaves. Does the tree understand you? What are you drawing? What's this? Daddy. Me? Jin-sung. Know what this is? I bought this for you, so come and try it out. Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors! That's unfair. Rock, paper, scissors! I said rock. I thought you said scissors. Say grandmother. Jin-sung, you can do it, right? The orphanage said jin-sung's iq is much higher than that of his peers. Why does he hold on to that nasty bug? You know how children are. I used to catch worms and play with them. Don't you remember? When did you ever do that? Want to go to your room? He's cute, huh? Did you really legally adopt him? How many times are you going to ask me? - What's that? - Hold on to it. I got it from a famous fortuneteller. Always carry it with you. I know a lot of women who had kids at over forty. Please stop. Don't come back here if you're going to act like this. You're too young to give up already. It's better to have one of your own blood. Jin-sung! Jin-sung, what's wrong? Did something happen? Where are you going? I can't believe it. How could she say that in front of him? It's an acacia leaf. Since the tree is sick and weak... hang it on the tree often... so it won't be lonely. - Who are they? - Mommy and daddy. Where are you, jin-sung? Kim jin-sung is drawing this. I'm sorry for getting mad. Mommy was wrong. I'll hang this on you every day until you get well. I hope you get better soon. - Hey! - Yes? Wait right there. I'm min-jee. You're jin-sung, right? How'd you know my name? I can hear everything from your porch. - How old are you? - Six. I'm older than you. I'm eight. You always talk to this tree. Does it talk back? - Don't you go to school? - Nope. - Why not? - I don't have enough blood. Do you know what a vampire is? That's what i am. You better be careful. Can you ride that well? Jin-sung, where are you going? Wait for me. I'll be with you from now on. You're a vampire now, too. - What was her name? - Min-jee. They must be having fun. I'm glad. Hello. Hello. - Congratulations. - Mi-sook never expected it. She's a bit confused. Come on, having a child is a blessing. There's nothing to be confused about. Did you do this? To burn the fan? Just leave it alone. I'll clean things up after i change. Jin-sung, don't worry. Nothing will change after the baby is born. You know i love you so much. You're no different. Having your own child is lovely, isn't it? Plus, a boy is better. Mother, please. My little hae-sung, time for your milk. Let's take a picture of hae-sung. Mother, look this way. - Hae-sung, it's daddy. - Hae-sung! Good. Here i go. One, two... hae-sung, look at daddy. Over here. One, two... why don't you sit down with hae-sung? Okay, good. One, two... my boy, jin-sung. Let's take one of you, too. Come on jin-sung, look at daddy. Jin-sung, good. Okay, one, two... don't cry. Jin-sung, stop that! What a rotten boy. What's going on? - He's terrible. - He was probably just playing. Playing? Covering a baby's mouth is playing? Look at his eyes. He looks like he'll kill me. He's not a normal child. - You witch! - You'll get a spanking if you say that. Jin-sung! Jin-sung, what's wrong? - Where's jin-sung? - Probably in his room. We shouldn't let him go near the baby. Don't be so sensitive. He's only a kid. I'm only concerned that there might be some accident. You're up. Let's see what jin-sung drew. Is this new? Nice work. Hae-sung must be up. Can you go check on him? Okay. Jin-sung, go wash up. You're really not going to eat? Aren't you hungry? - You should look at me when i talk to you. - I'm not hungry. - Come down and talk. - Why can't i stay where i want? - Looks like it'll rain. - I'll be all right. I'll be late, so don't wait for me. - Have a good time. - Have a good time. What's wrong? I better chop it down before jin-sung wakes up. If i don't, he'll form bad habits. He's just young. Jin-sung likes it. Just leave it alone. Okay, i'll call the pastor once i'm ready. Mom, stop saying that. You think it's easy to send him back? Okay. I said all right. - What are you doing? - I'm going. - What did you say? - I'm going to my mom! - Your mom's right here. - My mom? You? My mom is dead. She died and became a tree. Just go get another kid! Jin-sung! Don't die. Just go get another kid! Call the police. And tell them what? Report that he's missing. We can't just wait like this. Is this the police? I'd like to report a missing person. It's my son. He rode off on his bike last night. Kim jin-sung. Jin-sung. He did something wrong, and my wife yelled at him. But he hasn't come back. Excuse me? He's an adopted child. How did that get in there? What are you trying to do? - Think i did that on purpose? - Then was it me? Did hae-sung do it? Or did jin-sung come back and do it? Don't talk about jin-sung! Then whose is this? Who else has this kind of shit in the house? Drop your ridiculous work. And pay attention to the kid. Min-jee. Did something happen next door? Min-jee, what's wrong? Hi, hae-sung. Can i push it? Okay, but don't go outside. - Who's she? - She lives next door. She was jin-sung's friend. Hae-sung likes her. I was worried, but i'm glad you look better. Watch how you drive. Hey, ma'am, i told you that i was sorry. You think sorry is enough? You scared my child to death. Fuck, did i hit him? Did i hit him, you bitch? What kind of maniac are you? Crazy bastard. Mommy. Mommy. Where were you? I was so worried about you. You must be starving. Eat first and then let's talk. It hurts. I said it hurts! Someone must have comforted him by telling him... that his mother became a tree after she died on a rainy day. So whenever it rained, he'd often run out of our orphanage. Jin-sung. Strange. It never had a leaf... till last year. Mom! Mom, what's wrong? Mom! Mom. Jin-sung, you see. It's not that he won't come back. Maybe he can't come back. Maybe... maybe someone... are you okay? Shouldn't you be at the hospital? I'm okay. How's your mother's condition? The hospital will call when she regains consciousness. I'll be out for a while. Lock the doors. And go get some rest. You look very tired. You know where jin-sung is, don't you? - Where is he? - Why ask me when you know already? You're crazy. Watch what you say, you psycho. It's you who's crazy. I miss jin-sung. All i wish is for him to come back. Crazy bitch. Don't you know that it's your fault? Stop talking bullshit. Clean that up before i kill you. Don't touch hae-sung anymore. I smell blood on you. It's disgusting. - Hello? - is choi mi-sook there? - Speaking, who's calling? - pastor jung from hakdong church. Oh, hello. How are you? The same as always. So how's your mother? Nothing's changed. Anyway, how may i help you? Well, tomorrow's the exhibition, and i haven't heard from you. Exhibition? Yes, a fundraiser to help remodel the church. I thought your mother told you already. She said you'd call once you were ready. Okay, i'll call the pastor once i'm ready. Min-jee, you know something, don't you? You know you do. Mr. Kim do-il? - Who are you? - I'm a police officer. What can i do for you? You know the principal at hope orphanage, right? She's my cousin. So? So you have an adopted child who's missing. Yes. That's why i reported a missing person. Yes, i know. But you've been hard to reach. Look here. So what are you getting at? Do you know what has happened to our home after our boy disappeared? Go see for yourself. See my wife's condition first and then let's talk. I met her before i came here. She said that you had more to say about jin-sung's disappearance. Jin-sung told me to kill you. You're also going to kill hae-sung, aren't you? That's impossible. You can't. I know everything now. Crazy bitch. - What the hell are you talking about? - You killed him and buried him! You killed him! I should've cut down the tree. I told you i was going to chop it down. But you stopped me. You told me to leave it alone! - What are you talking about? - Don't you remember? You forgot everything about that day? It's you that killed jin-sung, not me. Mi-sook, it's you! Jin-sung would've been alive if i had cut it down that day. If you hadn't stopped me, jin-sung would be alive. It's not true! Do you really want to forget it all so much? To wipe it out of your memory? And then blame it all on me? Jin-sung! - This isn't your mother. It's just a tree. - It's my mother! It's all your fault! Stop it! Please stop. It's hurting jin-sung. Jin-sung didn't die. I can hear jin-sung's voice from the tree. No, it'll bleed! This is just a tree. A tree. It's not your mother. Now i'm the one you'll talk to. You can't go up there anymore. I'm going to chop it down. Got it? No. Don't do it. Mommy. Call the police. Report a missing person. We can't just wait like this. Jin-sung, i'm sleepy. I'm going to sleep.
