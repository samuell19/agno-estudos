And these are actually for sale in the bookshops? And in the streets, as well, Father. And in Toledo? Toledo, in Salamanca, Sevilla, and in the port of Cadiz. So these prints are sent abroad? These are sold in Rome. Even as far as Mexico. This is how the world sees us. This! This is how the world is seeing us. What is the name of the artist? Francisco Goya. Isn't he the man you commissioned to paint your portrait? He is, Father. Why did you choose him? In all humility, Father, I chose him for the same reason our king and queen have appointed him to be the court painter. They consider him the greatest painter in Spain. These prints are... quite disturbing, I must say. Disturbing? Yes, yes, of course they are. But, Father, these prints... show us the true face of our world. Maybe your world, Brother Lorenzo. How can you call these hideous images the true face of our world? There is but one world, Brother, and it is neither yours nor mine. It is the Lord's. Have you lost your sight, Brother? Do you not see what demonic filth and degradation this Goya is selling? He's an agent of the darkest powers. Granted that he's decorated chapels, he's painted angels, yes. But when your mother raises her eyes to pray to God, whom do you think she sees? Whom do you think Goya is using as models for his angels? Harlots! Those are whores smiling down at your mother from the ceiling! I assert... before all of you... that Goya is a valuable member of the Church. How so? Father, I have met women who cannot recite a single prayer. It's them. We have to seek them out. But what is our response? Condemn this great Spanish artist instead? Or do you think... by burning Goya's canvases, the evil this artist has depicted will go up in flames? Why don't we look at ourselves? What have we accomplished in the last 50 years? How many heretics have we sent to the stake? I will tell you exactly how many, Father. Eight. Eight burned at the stake. Are you proposing we show greater severity? Yes, Father, yes, yes. We have to return to the old ways. I'm talking about the God-fearing ways of the past. Are you prepared to join this battle? Never mind join. Grant me the wisdom to lead it, Father. Why doesn't that painting have a face? Because he's a ghost. No, he is not. - Have you ever seen a ghost? - No. But I have seen a witch. - Oh, did you? - Yes, but she had a face. So what did she look like? She was all bent and creepy and she stank. That's interesting, because the witch that I know, she's young, very lovely, and she smells of jasmine. - She does? - She does. And I'm working on her portrait right now. I'm no witch! How do you know? Am I allowed to say something? - Please. - I know that face. She would not be one of your angels in the Florida chapel, would she? Yes, she is. You're dangerously perceptive. This is probably a very naive question, but I am a man of the cloth. Do you... Do you painters not become very intimate with your models”? It must be very... very tempting when you spend hours and hours alone with not only beautiful but... young girl. Would you like me to include your hands in the portrait? I'll leave that up to you. No, no, no. It's up to you to decide. Hands are not easy to paint, and not everybody will spend the extra money. Well, what is the difference? One hand, 2,000 reales. Two hands, 3,000. Why did you agree to paint my portrait? Why not? Well, you have the reputation of mocking the men of cloth in your work. And harshly, I must say. Do I? Are you aware of how many powerful enemies you have, Goya? Well, fortunately, I also have a few very powerful friends. How have you been, dear Goya? As always, Your Majesty. - So don't complain. - I endeavor not to, Your Majesty. Oh, is this the wild steed that I am to conquer today? Oh, dear. So, how do you want me to ride? How do you want history to perceive you, madam? The way I am... young and beautiful. Which one do you wish for supper, my dear? Maybe... the vulture. May I stay and watch you work for a while? Why, if I may have any say in the matter, Your Majesty, I prefer no one see the work before it's finished. Am I intruding? Yes. You are, my dear. I see. As you wish. As you will. Whatever is your...pleasure. How long do I have to sit up here? For as long as I may need you there, Your Majesty. See what I am carrying? I must be a pious man, right? But look at what is really inside this. Voltaire! Voltaire! The dark prince of the darkest principles. Devious, huh? Devious. Be vigilant. Use your ears. People talk. You might hear somebody claiming that matter consists of very small elements called atoms. Get his name. He's a heretic, spreading these diabolical ideas to poison the souls of God-fearing people. If you hear somebody talking about the Temple instead of the Church, he's either a Judaizer or, even worse, a Protestant. Get his name. If you are in a public place and see a man hiding his penis with his hand while urinating, the man is probably circumcised. And he's a Judaizer. I am giving you just a few examples of what to look for, whom to identify. Bring their names to the attention of the Holy Office. Your eyes, your ears, your brain... they are the servants of God. Come on, Inés, taste it. It's good. Come on. Let me have a real. - Hey, where are you going? - She's going to the dwarf. No! You have received a summons from the Holy Office. Do you have any idea what it might be about? No. Where did you go last night? The tavern. Think. Did you say something sacrilegious? No. Was there an incident or something they could hold against her? She kissed the feet of a dwarf. - You did? - She did. - Everyone did. - You know... they can summon her just to testify against someone else. Someone else? Is there someone you know they might be interested in? I don't know. No. My child. Sit down, please. Are you Inés Bilbatua, begat by one Tomas Pio Bilbatua and his wife Maria Isabel? Yes, I am. We have only a few questions to ask of you, and we expect you to answer truthfully. I will. Is it true that on Wednesday, the 16th of this month, you dined at the inn of Dofia Julia? Yes, it is. What were you served that evening? For dinner? Oh, yes. You actually want to know what we...what we ate? For dinner. I had chicken. Onions... Chickpeas? Chickpeas. And? Potatoes. Green peppers. Were you served pork? Yes, but I didn't have any. Why not? I don't like it. I don't like the taste. Are you prepared to swear on the Holy Cross that you are telling the truth? About the pork? Are you? I swear on Jesus' sacred wounds, I'm telling you the truth. And I suppose that you would not object if we gave you an opportunity to prove it? No, I would be grateful. How would you like me to prove it? Did you tell us the truth? Yes. Yes, I did. We have reason to suspect otherwise. Why? We suspect the true reason you avoid pork is because you are a secret Judaizer. What? Are you? What is that? You practice Jewish rituals. No, I do not! You have something to confess. Do it now. But I... What do you want me to confess”? The truth. But I did! Tell me what the truth is! Tell me what the truth is! Hey, Tomas, how wonderful to see you, my friend. - How are you, Francisco? - Come in, come in. - Can I offer you anything? - No, nothing, thank you. Are we alone? Yes. I need to speak with this man, Francisco. Why? My daughter Inés has been summoned by the Holy Office. - Inés? - Yes. That is preposterous. She went in this morning, and she hasn't come out yet, and we haven't heard a word, either. Do you know why they might have wanted to talk to her? No. That's why I would like to speak with this man. Francisco, I'm very sorry to have to ask you this, but is there any way you can arrange it? But I'm in no position to curry favors from the Inquisition. No, no, no favors. I'm simply trying to learn if there is anything at all I can do to help my daughter. Well, I wish I... No! I cannot talk to the Holy Office about any matter that does not pertain directly to me. I'm sorry. I beg you, Francisco. Senor Goya. Father Lorenzo. Come in. This way. If I were to meet this man on the street, I would never recognize myself in him. One has such a different idea of oneself. You think you might like him? I do like the painting of him, I know that, I know that. Yes. Yes, yes. I'm very pleased with it, Francisco. Shall I choose a frame for it? Yes, please, do. And there's no need to send money. What do you mean? Somebody's paying for it. Who's paying for it? His name is Tomas Bilbatua. He's a very rich merchant. He also intends to underwrite the reconstruction of the Convent of Saint Tomas. And also, he's asked me to paint frescoes throughout the convent, which is a very welcome commission, I must admit. What is his name? Bilbatua. What does Senor Bilbatua want from me? He's the father of... You recalled seeing her face on the ceiling in the Florida chapel. Yes? She's been arrested by the Holy Office. I know him quite well. He's a very honorable man. Don't be afraid. Inés Bilbatua? Yes? I am here to see if I can... possibly be of some assistance. May I go home now? I don't have the power to decide that, Inés. I wanna go home. Do not fear, my child. I can deliver a message to your family. Do you want me to? Please...will you tell them that I love them? I love them so much. And please... Tell them that always, when I shut my eyes and I pray to God, I beseech Him to let me see my mother and my father and my brothers when I open my eyes. Do you want me to pray with you? Yes, please. Very good, Ines. I'll take care of you. It's all right, it's all right. - Hello. Welcome. - Tomas! Thank you, José. - How are you, Francisco? - I'm very well, thank you. Father Lorenzo. It's a great honor for me to welcome you in my house, Father Lorenzo. This way, please. These are my sons, Angel and Alvaro. Hello, Angel. And this is my dear wife... Maria Isabel. Father Lorenzo. - Welcome to our house. - Thank you. Please. Francisco. Thank you. The time has come for me to repay the Lord for all His kindness by restoring the Convent of Saint Tomas. You know, Tomas being my own name... I'm very sorry that my daughter cannot dine with us tonight. A most...a most marvelous work indeed, Goya. Thank you. As I was saying, the time has come for me to repay the Lord for all His kindness by restoring the Convent of Saint Tomas. To the successful restoration of the Convent of Saint Tomas. This wine is excellent. It was aged on a ship that has gone twice around the world. You know, it takes constant motion to bring out the flavor in this particular wine. Oh, I didn't know that. And these are anchovies from Santofia. I presume that you're anxious to have some news of your daughter. Oh, yes. Extremely so. She has never, ever been away. Did you see her? Yes, I did. How is she? She's in fine spirits and sends her love to all of you. When can we expect her home? I couldn't say. She must first stand trial. Stand trial? Why? For what she has confessed. What did she confess? She confessed that she had secretly practiced the Jewish rituals of her forebears. But that's impossible. We are an old Christian family. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the brothers in charge of the archives informed me that your grandmother's great-grandfather converted from Judaism to Christianity when he came to Spain from Amsterdam in 1624. Is that true? Yes. Bull am the only person in the family who knows that. Then why has your daughter confessed to it? Inés couldn't possibly confess to something she has no knowledge of. Excuse me. Was my sister put to "The Question"? Yes, she was. My daughter was tortured? She was put to "The Question." I thought that kind of investigation had been abandoned years ago. Yes, it was. It was. But now, in these troubled times, in its quest for the truth, the Church is bringing it back. So, you maintain that a confession obtained by the means of, as you call it, "The Question," is valid proof of anything? This is not an opinion of one simple monk, sir. It is a tenet of Church teaching that a confession obtained by "The Question" constitutes ultimate proof. I'm sorry, Lorenzo, but how can this sort of confession be an ultimate proof? If I were tortured, I'd confess to anything. I'd confess I was the Turkish sultan. - No, you wouldn't. - Oh, yes, I would. I would confess to anything to avoid pain. No, you wouldn't. You're a God-fearing man, Goya, aren't you? Of course I am. So your fear of God would prevent you from making a false confession. But what if the pain obscured my senses? What if my fear of pain became bigger than my fear of God? If you are innocent of the charge, God will give you the strength to withstand the pain. - Are you sure of that? - Yes. Forgive me, Father Lorenzo, but have you ever been put to "The Question" yourself? Have I ever been? Yes. Have you ever been subjected to "The Question"? Of course not. Do you think that if you were, and they asked you to confess something grotesquely absurd, say... say you were told to confess that you are really a monkey... Are you sure that God would grant you the fortitude to deny it, or would you rather confess to being a monkey to avoid the pain? I know I would. I know you would. So would ll. Would you? What is this, Tomas? Are you playing some sort of silly game with your guest? Nobody would ever ask Father Lorenzo to confess something so absurd. I would. Is he serious? Oh, I'm sure he's not. Alvaro, go get your father. Sometimes I don't understand his humor. - Nobody does. - Nobody does. Because my father doesn't have a sense of humor. Yes, he does. More wine? No, thank you. Francisco? "I, Lorenzo Casamares, hereby confess that contrary" to my human appearance, "I'm in fact the bastard son of a chimpanzee" and an orangutan, "and I have schemed to join the Church in order to do harm to the Holy Office." Sign it. This is a joke, Tomas, right? Sign it. Angel, block the door. Francisco, escort me out of this house. Stop Senor Goya. You're crazy. Francisco, please, stay out of this. Let us go. You can go. What do you mean I can go? And Father Lorenzo? Did he let my daughter go? Did you let my innocent daughter go?! Did he? Keep him here. Let Senor Goya go. Release him! Escort Senor Goya out. Tomas! Take your hands off me! This is outrageous! Are you ready to sign the confession? Don Francisco. Maria Isabel. Bring him here. Sign it. Tie his hands. Will you sign? All right, let's find out if God will give you strength to resist "The Question." Lift him up. I will burn this paper the moment my daughter returns home. But I won't wait forever. You must understand that. All right, you are free to go now. Father Lorenzo, you're forgetting something. This might be of great help to both of us. This is a very generous contribution indeed. We are grateful for your efforts, Brother Lorenzo. There is a request, Father. There usually is. Let us hear the particulars. The merchant would like to have his daughter back. Is she with us? Yes, Father. Yes. What is her status? A Judaizer. How did you respond to this request? I promised to plead for her release. On what grounds? I took into consideration the... the size of the endowment as well as the fact that she is very young. Did she confess? Yes, Father. She was put to "The Question." We shall accept this magnanimous gift with humble gratitude. We shall also carve the name of the donor in the convent in stone to commemorate his generosity forever. As for the daughter... I will pray to the Lord He may bestow His mercy on her. Of course, releasing her would contradict the basic principles of our faith because it would suggest that the Church doubts the power of "The Question." We are concluded. - Did you see my parents? - Yes, I did, I did. They are doing everything they can to get you out. And? And... They love you very much, Inés. Shall we pray together, Inés? I can't believe it! 1 am in fact the bastard son of a chimpanzee and an orangutan." I just... Can you believe this idiot? He's crazy. Your Majesty, I am a desperate father. And this was done only to prove that if put to "The Question," even the most innocent man of cloth will confess to the most preposterous absurdities. Yes. We beg you, Your Majesty, please use your authority to restore our daughter to us. Yes, I will see what I can do for her. I had a good look at the signature. There can be no mistake? It is Lorenzo's. Where is Brother Lorenzo? All the brothers are looking for him, Father. - Yes? - Francisco Goya y Lucientes? At your service. We have been told that you are painting a portrait of Lorenzo Casamares. Yes. Please come in. It's already finished. This way. I hope Father Lorenzo is pleased with the frame we've chosen for it. Lorenzo Casamares disgraced himself, and he is now a fugitive. A fugitive? I see. We are here to confiscate the portrait. Yes, of course. If he were to contact you, we would like to be notified immediately. Well, certainly. Oh, incidentally, ... I have not yet been paid for the painting. If we find him, we'll remind him. As the image of the man vanishes into thin air... may his name forever vanish from all memory. Whosoever pronounces his name, may he burn in the fires of eternal damnation. She will like this frame. You've done beautiful work. I've never been this close to our queen. But is she really that ugly? What's your point? It's a beautiful painting. Yes, but that does not make a queen beautiful. Don Francisco. Her Majesty wishes for you to go to His Majesty's chamber. Sit, Goya. Please sit. Sit, please. How did you like it? Very much, Your Majesty. Very much. Are you telling me the truth? I am, I am. I was very moved, Your Majesty. Not now! Do you know who composed that piece? No. Not really, sire. Mozart, maybe? No. Handel? I did. Really? Congratulations, Your Majesty. Excellent. And beautifully performed. So much for art. Now, sire, I wonder if I could have your opinion on my... All right, come in! Your Majesty, I have come from Paris. The French rabble has decapitated the King of France. The King of France? Yes, Your Majesty. King Louis... he was guillotined in a public execution six days ago. My cousin Louis? Yes, sire. Our soldiers must comprehend the noble purpose of their mission. They carry a personal message from me, Napoleon Bonaparte, that I will not stand by and watch our Spanish neighbors continue to suffer from the tyranny of corrupt and decadent kings, repressive clergy, and foreign imposters. Yes, the King of Spain is not even Spanish. He is French. And the Queen of Spain... She is Italian! No wonder the Spanish people hate the royal family as much as they hate the Inquisition! You have never fought an easier campaign, soldiers! The common folk will greet you with flowers and kisses on the streets of Madrid! The Spaniard cannot wait to break his chains and become a free man! I can see these explosions, but I can't hear them. I'm deaf. I am completely deaf now. But every morning I thank the Lord that He hasn't taken my sight away, that I've been able to witness and record what has been happening here. These are French soldiers, the Mamelukes, special cavalry recruited from Egypt by Napoleon to help liberate Spain, to bring us the noble ideas of the French Revolution... Liberty, equality, brotherhood. Then to defend the ideas of the Revolution, Napoleon, this scourge of royalty, made his own brother Joseph the King of Spain. But to my fellow Spaniard, Napoleon's armies are nothing but foreign invaders, occupiers. Who is in command of this place? God...is in command of this...and every other place on this earth, my son. In the name of Emperor Napoleon... Continue. ...and by the letter of the Rights... Brother. Brother. Give him air. Let him breathe. In the name of Emperor Napoleon and by the letter of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen... we hereby proclaim the Spanish Inquisition abolished... all of its properties confiscated... and all of its prisoners will be freed forthwith. Now go away. I'm deaf. I'm deaf! Sit down. Sit down. You have to write. Write everything down. Write what happened. I can't hear. Are you hungry? Are you hungry? I confessed... and they said I would be tried, but... there was never a trial. My father is dead now. My whole family's dead. The only thing I can think about is my child. You had a child? In prison? My daughter, my little girl. I need to see her. I need to take care of her. Can you help me find her? Please. Inés, look at me. Swear to God you're telling the truth. I need to talk to somebody from the Holy Office. But the Holy Office is long gone. - But they're not all dead, are they? - They might as well be. They're either all in prison or on the run. - Who's running the prison? - The French. And Napoleon has sent a special prosecutor along with his army. Will he receive me? Where would I find him? Stay here. Watch her. Felipe! Silence! Silence! Quiet! I am here to serve the ideas of the great French Revolution! They... They... They opened my eyes, as they are opening the eyes of the blind all over the world, because they are irresistible. They are logical, they are just. Universal. All men... All men are born free. All possess the same right, and those... those who refuse to see the light of liberty shall receive no mercy. There will be... There will be... There will be no liberty for the enemies of liberty! Father Gregorio... Do not take this personally. However... However, you are... the very incarnation of blind fanaticism and nepotism. You are the tool by the means of which few have kept the many in chains. You exemplify the very worst aspect of Spain, and so you will be judged for your deeds. By...By the unanimous decision of the judges... and by the power vested in them by the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen... this court sentences you... to death. Goya! Do you remember that rich merchant that made you confess that you were a... Yes. You remember. How could I forget him? What was his name? Bilbatua. Tomas Bilbatua. Yes, of course. How is he? He's dead. I'm sorry to hear that. No, it's his daughter. She needs help. Of course. She can come to see me anytime she wants. Well, she's here. She's in my carriage outside. Bring her in. I owe everything... I owe everything to... No, you don't have to shout. You can just speak slowly and articulate, and I can read your lips. I... I owe everything to that man. Because of him, I had to run to France. And there, suddenly saw in one bright flash how terribly wrong I have been all my life. Reading...Reading Voltaire, Rousseau, meeting Danton... Look, I was baptized again. I shed blood for the Revolution. A nasty wound. And I even got married there. Yes. Henrietta, my wife. I love her. And I have three children. Yes, I who took the vows of celibacy. So, you will have to paint my portrait with the whole family. That's... That's ten hands to paint. Ten hands. And I can afford them all now. Come in. Inés. - This is Lorenzo... - Casamares. Lorenzo Casamares. What can I do for you, miss? Don't, no, no. Please, stop this. Stop. Stop, please. Sit down. Sit. Just tell me what... what do you need? What can I do for you? What happened to our child? I beg your pardon? Is she... Is she with you? How long did they keep you in that prison? I don't know. And... You think you had a child in there? A little girl. Our daughter. Our daughter? Why do you believe that I am the father of your little girl? Because you are the only man I've ever known. Please, sit down. Sit down, please. What happened to the child? I don't know. They took her from me before... before she even tasted my milk. Inés, my dear, come here. Come. Come. Now, you will go with this nice young man, and he will take you to your daughter. All right? You just go with him. Go. Go on. Everything will be fine. I feel... such pity for these poor souls. - How barbaric we were. - Where are you sending her? She has obviously taken leave of her senses in jail. However, I will not fail her. I promise. - Will she be all right? - She will be well provided for. Do you think she invented the story about her child? I'm afraid so. I'm sure she did. Tell me... If a prisoner gave birth in the dungeons of the Holy Office... what would have happened to the child? Might this concern... your child? Please...respond to my question. If I do, will you spare whatever remains of my life? Will you kindly let me die in peace? Yes. Can I trust a... a monkey? Yes. There are no girls here born in '93 and brought from Madrid? Are there? Well, there was one who would answer that description. See... 1793, Madrid, sent here by the Holy Office. Which one is she? She's not here. She ran away from us when she was only 11. Where is she now? Only God can answer that question. She was a little tiger. Is it known who her parents were? Not really. Did they mention their names? Oh, no. They never do. - Did you baptize her? - Immediately. What was her baptismal name? - Alicia. - Alicia. Alicia. Come on. Come on. Who was that girl there? Her name is Alicia, and she's as sweet... - What's her name? - Alicia. Write it down. Alicia. All right. Alicia. Will she be back? No, no, not today. Tomorrow. What? You can have her tomorrow. My God. What is this? This is by the Flemish painter Hieronymus Bosch. El Bosco, sire. It's called The Garden of Earthly Delights. Do you like this? Well, it is very bizarre. You're right. But, of course, it's Flemish. And it is very well painted. This is neither my kind of a garden nor my kind of delights. I would never send this to Napoleon. This is not my brother's taste. No, you can keep this thing right here in Madrid. Now, this looks promising. This is Carlos IV. I met him. And his wife. Although I don't recall her being that ugly. How did she manage to have so many lovers? She was the queen, sire. This is a masterpiece. Indeed it is, sire. I'm sure my brother would appreciate this. And he can just do that? Take paintings from the Royal Gallery and pack them off to Paris? We have to express our gratitude for what Napoleon did for freedom in Spain somehow. Yes? Senor Francisco de Goya is here 10 see you, sir. - Bring him in. - Wait. Show Senor Goya to my study and Kindly ask him to wait. Thank you. I'm sorry, Francisco. At lunch I'm a family man. - May I offer you something to drink? - No, thank you. No. I just want to get in touch with Inés Bilbatua. Why? Well, she was telling the truth. She does have a daughter. How do you know? I saw her. - You saw her? - Yeah. Did you talk to her? No, no, I just saw her. How do you know that the girl you saw is Inés' daughter? She looked...she looked exactly like her mother did when I painted her 16 years ago. It was a perfect replica. Where did you see her? In the Pardo Gardens. In..In the Gardens? Yes. She is a... Yes, she is. Do you know her name? - Alicia. - Alicia. Do you think you could bring Inés to my house? I want the mother to meet her daughter. Of course. Go on. Is your name Alicia? Yes. Where were you born, Alicia? In an orphanage. Do you know who your parents were? My mother was a heretic. So, where do you wanna do it? Right here? Nowhere, nowhere. I just want to talk to you. You're not the police, are you? I would like to make you a proposition. All right. Leave Spain. - Leave Spain? - Yes. - And go where? - America. - With you? - No. But if you leave Spain, I will provide you with enough money that you will never want for... No, no, no, no, please let me out. Wait, calm down, calm down. Let me speak. I'm not gonna end up in some brothel or harem. Calm down! Let me speak! Let go of me or I'll scream. Wait, stay here. Wait! Quiet! Quiet! Let me speak. Listen to me. Quiet. Alicia, come back. Even if this Alicia actually were Inés' daughter... which I doubt, which I doubt... If she were, I would never want to bring those two together. Why not? For me, the idea of telling a mother "I found your daughter and she's a whore" is unthinkable and cruel. I could never bring myself to do it. But they're the same flesh and blood. Plus, Francisco... Inés is not in control of her senses. Where is she? She's in very good hands. Where? I need to talk to her. Why is she so important to you? You are completely obsessed with her. You yourself noticed her! That face is engraved on my mind. She's the angel descending from heaven in La Florida. I see her in taverns, I see her in the streets, in my dreams! I saw her face when I thought I was dying in Cadiz. And I didn't do anything for her when she needed it. I'm not going to abandon her again. Can you understand that? Where is she? Francisco... That poor woman has lost her mind. I said where is she?! - I don't care who you are. - I'm painter to the king! To which king? Do you know how many kings I have in here? I even have two Napoleons, and one of them is an Arab. The other one is 7'2" tall. - Is he deaf? - Yeah. Painter to the king! He could be blind. Who is this woman, anyway? Inés Bilbatua. How much is she worth to you? How much is she worth to you? 1,000 reales. 1,0007! 100. You must be crazy. And take it as a professional opinion! There are revolutions everywhere. The world is going to hell. The British have landed in Portugal, and I am responsible for this hospital. And you have the audacity to offer me 1007? 500. 500. - 200. - All right. Is there anybody else here that he wants? Inés. No, not again. You cannot carry a baby all your life. No woman can. No! No, Maria, no! - Stop it! Stop it. - Inés! Hold her! Get her! Stop it! Stop it! Let her go! Inés. Inés. Inés! Inés! Don't you remember me? You can go home now. I found your daughter, Inés. See, you have to go. He has found your daughter. - My daughter? - Yes. My baby? Halt! What's happening here? Why can't we go through? Inés, wait in the carriage. You keep an eye on her. Miss Alicia? Yes. I'm Francisco Goya. I'm painter to the king. Is that your child? No. I want you to come with me and meet somebody. Another man? No, no, no, no. Oh, I understand. No, no, no, I'm not talking about... I want you to meet somebody to whom you are very important. Who? Alicia. You've never met your mother, have you? And? Alicia! No, don't touch her! Alicia! - Where is she? - She went that way. But didn't I tell you?! Go find her. I say, "Don Francisco want you to stay here." Bring her home! Bring her home! Bring him in. Did you decree that deportation? Yes. So you're sending all these girls to America just to get your poor harlot daughter out of the way. This is the best thing for those women. It's the best thing. What are you saying? Say it again. It is a new life for them. It's a new life. A new life! To be sold as slaves in America? It is better than living in this whorehouse called Spain. What are you saying? Wake up, Francisco. The Spanish people couldn't care less about ideals. Spain today is one big whorehouse. Whore?! Are you calling me a whore? You have the audacity to call me a whore? And what are you? Look at you! Look what you are today. But do you remember what you were yesterday? Who's the whore here? Don't lecture me, Francisco. Do not lecture me. At least I tried to do something. And I always believed in what I was doing. - I am a believer, Francisco. - Wait. ll am a believer. But you? Look at you. You work for anyone who pays. Yesterday the King of Spain, today the French, tomorrow probably that bastard Wellington! - No. - Yes, Francisco. You only believe in money. You are the whore. What is it? The king has just received news that the British have crossed the border from Portugal to Spain and are advancing. According to a reliable source, they are not meeting any resistance, and the Spanish are joining the British in their assault on our outposts. What are the king's orders? The king and his family left for Madrid half an hour ago. And Madrid? The news hasn't reached the city vet, sir. Inés. I want her to sleep. Her father has not seen her yet. I don't want her to be crying when she sees him. Charge! Wait! Halt! Back to France, you cowards! Come on, boys! B Company, close up! Francois? Brother Lorenzo, I hope you will understand there is nothing personal in our judgment. However, you became the living embodiment of diabolical ideas. You proclaimed that man is higher than God and that the words of the Gospels are nothing but lies and poison. You must never, never be allowed to repeat your crimes. Therefore, the Church declares you guilty, and your punishment will be death. But...if you repent publicly, the merciful hand of the Church will spare your life. Your body will be saved, and even your soul, if you'll join us again in the ever-loving arms of God. Lorenzo... my son... Will you repent? No, I'm sure. Lorenzo! Lorenzo! Lorenzo! Over here! Well, what do you think will happen to him now? Repent, repent. Come back to us, and God will receive you into His arms. You have come too far. Open your eyes, see the world you have lost. Repent. God will forgive your sins if you repent now. Repent. Brother, repent. Repent. Repent. God will... Oh, God. ...be damned for all eternity. God will forgive your sins. You have lost your sight. Open your eyes. You still have time to plead for God's mercy. For God is all merciful. Lorenzo! Inés!
