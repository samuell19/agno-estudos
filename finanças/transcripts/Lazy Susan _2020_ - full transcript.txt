You were in the parking lot in broad daylight at the grocery store, and you get kidnapped, and then you're held for several days against your will out in this old barn. What is going through your mind while you're in captivity? I just told myself that I would survive and that there was no way I was giving my life or my power over to this man. Wow, that's amazing. Now, I understand part of this survival story is connected to a guitar pick? Yes. I had a guitar pick in my pocket because I was taking guitar lessons at the time. I love the guitar. And I waited for an opportunity for Andy to nod off, and when he did, I used the pick to cut through the ropes that he had tied my hands and feet with, and then I just ran like hell. Wow, and I see you actually brought the guitar. Yeah, do you want to... do you want to hear a song? No. No, no, no, no, but I want to thank you so much for coming, and I hope you'll come back with that guitar and the pick. - Oh, crap. - ...and tell us... And welcome back. This is DJ Coyote Carl. On KRPP, spinning on the nines, bringing you all of today's hits and the freshest of sounds that your Midwestern ears can handle. Nice. You throw like a girl. What do you mean, throw like a girl? That was a swish. Bathsheba, we talked about this. Mind your manners. Not so bad yourself, Bathsheba. Want to play cornhole toss, Susan? I'm super busy right now, Laney. I don't have time to toss anything, but your bird is pretty. Hey, Susan, you want to hear a joke? No, Leon, I-I don't. I can't, I'm... I'm late for work. Oh, where are you working now? Hmm? Uh, at a florist. Kind of all-around, you know, party planning and doing mergers, you know, things like that. I like your black... I mean your bike. I know that that's a bike, and I know that you are a black person. Um, I should bounce. I'm gonna bounce. ♪ Once or twice you made it easy ♪ ♪ Here we are all over again ♪ ♪ Telling lies it completes you ♪ Hello? Hey, it's Cameron. What do you want, a medal? - You're such a bitch. - Don't worry about it. Did you get Mom a birthday present? Not yet. Well, her birthday is on Monday. What are you gonna get her? Why don't you just put my name on your gift? - No. - Why not? What do you mean, why not? Why not just put my name on your gift like you did last year with the comforter set? I don't want to do it this year. Why not? Just get her a fucking present. She'd really appreciate something from you. - Like she'd care. - Oh, you two are impossible. She wants those stackable bowls in different colors. - Get her those. - Where do you even get... Figure it out. I've got seven EKGs to run in the next 60 minutes, which is mathematically impossible. - Yeah, well, I have eight. - Eight what? - Don't worry about it. - Fuck... Moron. ♪ But I left you long ago ♪ Look at those. What am I looking at? Those cowboy boots. Don't you love those cowboy boots? Oh, yeah, those are good boots. I just feel like if I had a pair of cowboy boots, I'd be like... I don't know, I'd be like, "Yes," you know? Everything... Well, that's 'cause boots like that, you can dress them up, super fancy. You can dress them down, super caj. That's the magic. - Exactly. - Right? How much do you think they cost? I don't know, those are, like, $100, maybe more. Hey, ladies. Hey. What's with the duct tape? Ah, it's kinesiology tape. I busted up my shoulder doing a keg toss in college, but it was for charity, so it's kind of a badge of honor. You almost done with that? Yeah. Did you want some? Ah. The bike. Oh, yeah, I'm just... Oh. Ugh. Whew, that was intense. You got a good final burn in there, huh? Yeah, thanks. Well, good luck. Sweet, thanks. Hey, I think he likes you. - The duct tape guy? - Yeah. - He doesn't even know my name. - Did you see him wink at you? He totally winked. Corrin, he was blinking. Mm. Ahhh! What the fuck, Mom? You scared the shit out of me! Your scream could break glass! I mean, who walks into somebody's house and just starts eating chips? It's my house too. I grew up here, remember? Would you get the humidifier down from the hallway closet for me? - Why can't you do it yourself? - 'Cause I'm 66 and fucked. Okay, can I have some money, then? For getting the humidifier down? No, rent is due on the first, and my unemployment check doesn't come until the eighth. Of course. Oh, that's the same look your father gave me right before he left us for that lady dentist. Then he went and died, as if that was supposed to make up for it. - Ugh, here we go. - You know what's funny? You're the one who made the dentist appointment? Well, what else was I supposed to do? His breath was so bad, it was like he had an asshole where his mouth was supposed to be. If I'd been willing to kiss a little ass, he'd probably still be around. Oh, did I tell you what Meredith said? Who's Meredith? The woman who cuts the chicken at the Jewel-Osco. You need to shave your legs, Susan. She heard me say that my son was a physician's assistant. Who were you telling that to? Oh, I don't know, someone else in line. Wait, what? Someone in line? So you just tell people you're standing next to in line that your son Cameron's a physician's assistant? I don't remember. Anyway, Meredith said, "If he's a physician's assistant, "he must be a genius because physicians assistants "are even better than doctors these days 'cause they can't get sued for malpractice." I'm pretty sure he's just too stupid to be a doctor. Cameron says... that the reason I still have this cough is 'cause it's too dry in here. She asked me about my daughter. - Who did? - Meredith. Who? I told her you just lost your job. - Who? - You did. - Did what? - You lost your job. - What? - You lost your job! 'Cause the flower company went out of business! Cameron just sent me flowers from there two weeks ago. Well, my department went out of business. I thought you were in delivery! I was in, uh, rose nutrition. Where's your purse? On the kitchen table. I expect you pay me back this time! Oh. Why'd you turn the humidifier off? The yelling was making me nauseous. I'll plug it back in when I leave. Uh-huh. There you go. Your father could never keep a job either. You want some tea? I'll see you for your birthday on Monday. You know, if it was up to me, I wouldn't celebrate my birthday, but Cameron says it's important to celebrate me. - Bye, Mom. - What? ♪ Hey ♪ Attention, Kmart shoppers, have you tried our online shopping? If your shopping list won't fit into your to-do list... Hey, Susan. Hey, Velvet. You look tired. I was in Cancun on my annual girls' trip with a few of my old sorority sisters. That's why you're so tan and tired. It was a blast, and they just made me employee of the month yesterday, so I'm getting a lot of calls. Yeah, um, I'm employee of the month at the flower shop I work at, so... And I got a $50 bonus. I get free tulips for a year. Awesome. I love tulips. It's mine and my boyfriend's flower. We say it means love without pressure. Awesome. My phone's blowing up, so... Yeah, I should probably check mine. I'm waiting for a call from Jackie Minns. Jackie Minns who lived across the street from you? - You're still friends with her? - She colors my hair. Cool. I think I'll take them. - What? - The boots. These? You should. Boots make your legs look super long. - They're not cheap. - 104, right? Plus 5.77% tax, brings the total to 110 even. Maybe. Scooters are usually reserved for disabled customers. I know, it's not like I was riding it around or anything. So these... these aren't your stackable bowls? - Nope. - Cool. What size are you? - I'm a nine. - I'm an eight. Andy... Boil your own damn potatoes then. Nah, nah, nah, I'm out of here. Make your own damn potatoes. Cameron. Who is Mommy's favorite little boy? - Guys, guys, guys. - Susan... Susan come here. Mary... - Got one. - Don't stop taping. - What is pi, Susan? - Dad! What is pi? Pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. Regardless of the size of the circle, pi's always the same number, 3.141592653589. - Mary, did you get that? - I got it. I sure don't know where you get your brains. Oh, I hope there's a job out there for a flute blower who can dance. Look, Mommy. I'm drawing a rainbow. "Your beauty should not come from outward adornments, "such as braided hair or gold jewelry or fine clothes, "but from the inner disposition of your heart, "the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in God's sight." Peter 3:3-4. - Yay. - Yay! - Yes, love that. - Happy birthday, Grandma. Oh, my goodness. I wonder what this could be. - We made it from a book. - Oh, will you look at that? It's a paper hedgehog. And those are fashion drawings. Oh. Oh, how gorgeous. Will you make me a dress like that to wear to church? - You're so talented, Jenika. - You are too, Aunt Susan. For two weeks she got her homework done early so she could finish her presents for Grandma. That is so sweet. Can I get you some more cake, Mary, or some orange juice? - I'm fine. - Are you sure? Are you feeling okay? You want me to rub your back? She's fine, Wendy. - Here, Mom. - Oh. - Open my gift, okay? - Oh, look at that. Another art project. Look. - Oh, cool. - Yeah. You know, if you're not gonna give me a grandbaby, I think this is the next best thing, one of these art projects. All right, one more gift. So this is from the three of us. I decorated the envelope. Jenika decorated the envelope. We wanted to do something extra special for you this year, Mom. Why, 'cause I'm so old? Oh, it is a privilege to age, Mary. She doesn't like it that hard. So we're all going on a trip. - What? Toronto? - Niagara Falls. We're taking you to Niagara Falls. Ohh! Leave it to Cameron. Niagara Falls is on my vision board. You know, the deaf woman at Walgreens, she says you can't even look at the falls without getting soaked. You have to wear raincoats. That's right. We saw that on the website. I did an oral report on the falls in the third grade. Yeah, I bet you didn't know that the first person to go over the falls in a barrel was 63-year-old schoolteacher Annie Edson Taylor, and despite myths to the contrary, it does not freeze in the winter. - I do know that. - Yeah? Hmm. You're not going. You said... you said we're all going on a trip. All of us, not you. You know, I'm going back to Weight Watchers because I just saw on the news that a woman was suing Delta 'cause her fat got stuck between two seats. Nonsense, Mary. You're in terrific shape for a woman your age. Can't Aunt Susan come too, Daddy? No, we're not gonna take Susan. - Not this time, honey. - Ugh! I don't know what's going on right now. I'm not financing you. If you can pay for your own airline ticket and buy a hotel room, then yeah, you can come with us. That's everything. Then I'm just paying for my own trip. That's right. That's how it works. Mom, can I borrow some money? No, she's not giving you any more money, and you're not putting your name on any more of my gifts, and none of us are giving you any more free rides. This is Mom's birthday, and you're ruining it. Why are you doing this? Yeah, it's Mom's birthday. Stop asking her for money. What I think Cameron is trying to say, Susan, is... and don't take this personally, but we've all worked pretty hard for what we have, and I think what Cameron is feeling is it's time to end this pattern. Nobody talks like that, Wendy. Mom. - Mom. - Mom. - Mom, tell her. - Mom. We talked about this. You need to get a job, Susan. You need to get a job. I had a job at the flower shop, but it went out of business. We were just there. It's still open. My department went out of business. Jenika, go get your iPad. What about your job at the carpet store? It was dangerous. - What? How? - Don't worry about it. Okay, and the movie theater? If you have a point, Cameron, you better think long and hard about making it. I thought you were going back to school online. I thought that was such a positive move. I was. I am. I... I've forgotten my password. I can help you, Aunt Susan. I'm good at computers. Thanks, Jensy. I... I would really like that. Well, you're gonna have to figure something out 'cause Mom's not gonna be around to take care of you forever. You should be taking care of her by now, not the other way around. She doesn't need taking care of. Oh, yeah? Her blood pressure's through the roof, she eats like shit, she's still smoking, and both Pop-Pop and Nan died of heart attacks before they turned 70. Why do you think we're taking her to Niagara Falls? We're trying to do something special for her while there's still time. Is Grandma gonna die? Not today, honey. I'm gonna clean these plates. Don't want to leave a dirty house in case I don't wake up in the morning. - Mommy, I'm sorry. - Oh, don't call me Mommy! We'll help you, Mary. He didn't mean that like it sounded. Jenika, come on, let's go help Grandma clean up in the kitchen. - Fucking... - Fucking moron. Fuck you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, you guys, that's too fast. Andy, Kyle, listen. You never listen. Jesus, I'm gonna barf. Stop it. Go find your sister and push her on the thing. - Sorry. - It's okay. Sometimes I wish my family died in a house fire, you know? Over Christmas, caused by a short in a strand of lights on the Christmas tree. Yeah, but they don't make those kind of lights anymore. And they all died of smoke inhalation. - It's not safe. - Except for me, you know? I toddled out of the house with a Barbie doll in my hand and a ponytail on top of my head. I was a Christmas miracle, and then everyone in the country put money in a fund for poor baby Susan. - Wouldn't that be great? - Yeah. You know, if people asked what I did for a living, I would just point to my scars, you know, and just say, "This is what I do." "Oh." Then we could have written a song. We could have called it "Baby Susan," right? - "Baby Susan." - We could sell it on iTunes. Why don't we have a record deal? It's like, you turn on the TV, it's like, "American Idol," it's like, "The Voice," it's just like they're giving away record deals. Well, wait a sec, 'cause I was listening to the radio today. - Coyote Carl? - Yeah. I'd love to give that DJ a BJ. - I would love that. - Oh, my God. Anyway, he said that there was this talent show coming up and some kind of contest. - Are you effing serious? - Yeah. - Why didn't you tell me that? - I am telling you. This could change my life. We could win a lot of money, I bet. I need money so badly, Corrin, like, yesterday. You know, I saw at the DMV that they were hiring a labor relations manager. Why don't you apply for that job? Really? Does... Oh, you probably need to know what that is. I don't know what it is. You probably also need a clean driving record. My car is cleaner than my driving record. I'll take you. I mean, I'll take you to sign up and to apply and to find out what it is. - No, that's okay. - You wanna? No, I'm just gonna keep spinning for a while. Where's Vivi? Boys, where is Vivi? Vivi? Oh, there you are. What do you have? - A stick. - Oh, thanks, honey. That means she has to go make. - Make what? - She has to make number two. I never should have taken her out of diapers. - Hello? - Susan, it's Doug. Hey, Doug. Listen, I dropped off rent a few days ago. Don't say I didn't 'cause I did. Yeah, uh, $50 short plus a $15 late fee. What? Oh, my God. Oh. Somebody must have taken $50 out of the envelope. $65, actually, 50 for the rent and... Well, I'm telling you somebody stole... What the fart? What... What the... what is wrong with you? Shoot, sorry. Can you not see me in that monster truck? Sorry. Sorry. It's my fault. I don't have time for an accident. I'm so sorry, I am not... Susan from the gym. How did... Look, I'm Phil, by the way. Phil. I mean, I'm not Phil. My name's Susan. Yeah, I'm sorry. I, uh... I got distracted like an idiot, and next thing I know, I'm banging into the back of you. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I was just heading to a job interview at my job. I'm interviewing someone else for another job at the place that I work at. Are you sure you're okay? Oh, yeah, I'm just a little shaken up, but I'm okay. I love your "blouze." Oh, "thankz." I love your "shoez." Mm. "Thankzzz." All right, let's see what we got here. Um, that's not too bad, right? Yeah, just a little denty. I'd hate to get insurance involved. It'd take forever. - Who's got that kind of time? - Too much paperwork. - For sure, for sure. - Ends up being more complicated than it needs to be. - I don't even have it. - I'll tell you what. Can I, uh, grab your phone, and I'll put my number in it? Sure. Okay, and then why don't you get an estimate, and you can just text me, and I could, I don't know, pop over to your place and bring a check, or I can just send it in the mail, either. Sure. You send it or pop over. It's up to you. Great. So I will send or pop. Great. Oh, and please, will you take this and get a massage to work that kink out of your neck? It is a little kinky. Hmm. You're funny. You're nice to say I'm funny. Oh, well, you're nice to say I'm nice to say you're funny. That's funny. Well, I am both sorry and happy that I bumped into you, Susan. Likewise. Oh, uh...

I don't even know if you're a church person. Me, I just go for the music, myself. Then next week we're supposed to go on a family trip to Niagara Falls, but I don't know if I'm going because I don't have the funds right now just because...

That talent show is this week, and guess who got us a spot. Are you fucking kidding me? And the first 25 callers get to perform at the grand reopening of that used car dealership over on Bayard. The one that used to be a gas station? Yes, so I called. - What number were you? - 22! - No, I wanted to guess! - Well, we're 22. Well, why don't you have a shirt on? Oh, I gave it to Andy. There were skulls on it, so he made a cape. Andy, I want to see your cape! And get this, everyone who performs gets a $200 gift certificate to the Jewel-Osco. That's, like, a dream. I'm so sick of spending money on food. Listen to this, the winner, the grand prize, gets to open for the Fat Sams on their tour for two months, Susie Bird. How about that? Right? Oh. Oh, but we need to come up with a name for the band by the end of the day. - This is huge. - Hey, honey. Vivi wants another slice of pizza. - Are we out of pizza? - No. So go in there, open the box, put your hand in, take out a slice, and give it to her. Okay, honey, thank you. I can do that. Hey, Tom, we need a name for our band. We're trying to think of a name. - I don't know. - "I don't know." We need something clever that says, like, ladies who play the ukulele and the flute. How about Ukulady and the Tramp? Why don't you go rest your mouth, okay? I kinda like Ukulady and the Tramp. I know, I do too. I just don't want to give it to him. ♪ You may cross the barren desert ♪ ♪ But you will not die of thirst ♪ Hey, baby. It's me, just wondering where you are. Give me a shout when you can.

So he's not gonna make it? Well, Mom, I don't know if he can because he only exists inside Susan's head. I think you're confused, Cameron. I think you might be thinking of Edward, your imaginary friend from when you were, like, nine. I was four, and it was totally normal. Guess what. It's not. Dad and I thought you were a psychopath. Susan, don't mention your father near a church. He was a selfish asshole. Let's try to remember it's Jenika's day. Aunt Susan, did you get me a present? Oh, yeah, sweetie. I got you... Fuck. Here's some headbands. Awesome. - And some Krazy Glue. - Cool! Yeah, go crazy. Yeah, we better get going before the meatloaf gets ate up. Meatloaf? Are we going to the hospital again for meatloaf day? What I wouldn't give to have that recipe. Maybe you and Phil could meet us there? - There is no Phil, people. - Don't call me people. I told you, I hate that. There is a Phil, and we're probably moving in together soon, and he's paying my way to Toronto, where I'm gonna hold your head under the goddamn falls! Oh, sorry, Pastor. I'm gonna call you about a wedding. Do you do weddings? I'm gonna call you. No, I don't really care. So that's not really his fault. - Hi. - Hi. Have you guys seen Blair? Actually, I think I saw her flirting with the bartender. - Classic. - But that was a while ago. - Typical. - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. What does everyone have against Blair? I thought you were all friends. Not anymore, 'cause she never thinks before she opens her big mouth. She also talks like a robot. She also chews way too loud, like a farm animal. That is harsh. Oh, hey, will you bring me that rosé? Oh, and a Basil Hayden's, while you're at it? You have got to be kidding me! Nice way to start your day. Look, I work just up the street, and I'm late for a very, very important presentation, so if you could just meet me there, that would really... - What? - In, like, 30 minutes.

Why are you being such an annoying bitch? Oh, that's really nice. Look, I have no idea what I did to upset you, but whatever it is, I'm sorry, I'll stop. You know exactly what you did. - No, I don't. - Oh, yeah? You got any jacks? Go fish. Hey, Sue, want a burger? Check this out. - Keep practicing, Laney. - You have any threes? Hey, you want to hear a joke? No, Leon, I don't have time to hear about your legs. Okay, sorry. You don't want to hear about my legs? You have any threes? I mean, what... what did happen to your legs? Well, I was gifted with polio as a child. - Hey! - Go fish. Oh, cool. I mean, I'm sorry. That's... that's sad. Anyway, I'm gonna... I'm gonna bounce. You got any fives? You are a cheater. - Yay, you made it. - Sorry, Jensy. I can't stay. Just grabbing some eats to go. You even sound like your father. - You need to wear a slip, Susan. - I'm with them. Excuse me. I'm looking for Phil, the owner. Uh, yeah, he should be around here somewhere. Uh, there he is. Over by the foam pit with his wife and kids. Great guy. Great dad too. Uh, ma'am, you dropped your bag or your purse. Oh, that's your purse. ♪ All the kids in the marketplace say ♪ ♪ Way-oh, way-oh ♪ ♪ Way-oh, way-oh ♪ Susan, maybe it wasn't his wife. But the tall, weird kid said it was his wife. It was probably his wife. I don't know, Corrin, she was pregnant, and she had that pregnant glow, you know? - And she looked so happy. - Aww. Like a woman on one of my dream collages. Well, but her husband's cheating on her. Yeah, but she doesn't know that, and what you don't know doesn't count. I don't count, you know? Of course you count. Come on. In my mind, Corrin, we were... we were already married, you know? Yeah. And, um, raising kids of our own, you know? They were... they were sweet and small like Phil, but, you know, they had hair and everything. Listen to me. Look at me. You can still have kids, just not with Phil, but you can... listen. You can have them with somebody else. You can even have them by yourself. When you say his name, it's like you literally took razor blades and you cut my face. Sorry. But you know what? Heartache is great for music. So why don't you take these feelings you're having of loneliness and sadness and channel it for the show? - Yeah. - For the show, the show. - Okay, yeah, I am. - All right? I think it's gonna be a good show. It's gonna be a good show. You're gonna be fine. Yeah, we're gonna be great. - Yeah. - I should probably go. Okay. You should go home and rest. - Don't think about Phil! - Ow, my face. Sorry. Hey, Susan, this is Doug. I got your IOU and this collection of magazine clippings pasted together on a piece of paper. They're very nice, but they do not your rent make. Plea... Susan, it's your mother. We need to be at the airport at 1:00 tomorrow. Cameron wants us to just take a cab, but I don't want him throwing his hard-earned money away when you're not doing anything. So what are you looking to get for this today? Uh, two... $20,000? The diamonds are moissanite. I'll give you 250. Take it or leave it. It's fine. How much is this? - $5. - I want this too. - Okay. - But I want it for free. Okay. A little more weight towards the... I'm going to pull it out and then... What's with the suitcases? I'm coming with you to Niagara Falls, which means I can't drive us, so I guess we're gonna have to take a taxi. - How'd you pay for a ticket? - Don't worry about it. It's just a one-way ticket, but I'll figure out how to get back. Who knows, maybe I'll even stay and make a life for myself there under the falls. - Do you have a passport? - What? Canada's another country. You need a passport. How long does it take to... It took us over a month to get ours because the system is so overwhelmed. I brought an empty shampoo bottle, and it said on the website of the hotel that you could win a free return trip next year. Wait, what's that about a shampoo bottle? Yeah, I guess people take some of the water back home with them from the falls. Oh, I didn't know that. And I think I read on the website that the hotel has a free dessert and happy hour from 5:00 to 7:00 every night. Stop! Get out! Get the hell out of my car! Get out! - Ooh! - Thanks. Uh, get out on Daddy's side. Just go by... Great, Susan, great. Real nice. Cursing in front of my fucking grandbaby. - I got this one, Cameron. - I just don't understand you.

I know I missed the show, but I got detained, and when I say that, I literally mean detained, arraigned and detained for spray-painting Phil's face. Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was last night? How embarrassed you were? Corrin, 700 firefighters saw up my skirt. You know what? I don't care. It doesn't even matter, all right, Susan? I don't even know what you're talking about. What you did to me last night was inexcusable, and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of taking care of you. I'm tired of worrying about you. Everything you do is always about you, and I'm done, and I'm done with your crazy stories. Corrin, but I'm ready to get my shit together for real this time. I don't believe you, Susan. It's like... It's like you're stuck, like you're stuck in quicksand. Mom, can we bust this over your head? No, please get that out of the house. - Move. - Hey, Tom. Um, also, I have been temporarily evicted from my apartment. Oh, Jesus. And I was just wondering... I know it's not a good time to ask if I could stay with you guys for just a couple... When it rains, it pours, dick breath. Boys, that wasn't funny. - Sorry. - Good shot. Leon? Oh, oh. Jesus. Susan. Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me. Sorry, not sorry. What do you want, Doug? What are you doing in Leon's apartment? I'm staying here for a while. It's none of your business. I mean, what are you doing in your apartment? - What? - Nothing. - This is highly irregular. - You're highly irregular. You kicked me out of my apartment. Well, you didn't give me much choice. I didn't have choices. Instead I found all my stuff on the lawn. What'd you expect me to do? I gave you, like, nine warnings. What do you want, Doug? I just found Leon's keys outside on the lawn. They want me to bring over some of his stuff. Turns out I'm his emergency contact, if you can believe it, which is also highly irregular. Emergency contact for what? Susan, are you... Leon's in the hospital. He collapsed in the courtyard this morning. Laney found him, had to call 911. How do you not know about that? Susan? Susan? Everything okay in there? You've been in there quite a while, which is highly irregular. I should probably get over to the hospital before too long. Uh, I think they're expecting someone. Hi. Hey. I would have come sooner, but I didn't know. - That's okay. - I have your keys. - They were on the lawn. - Thanks. I also drove your van here because the police have my car. Oh. Okay. I also squared away your rent for the month with Doug. You did? No, I didn't. I don't know why I said that. It's a lie. I lie a lot. Sorry for putting you in the hospital. It's not your fault. It's my diabetes. Probably should have had a hit of the OJ before we... You have polio and diabetes? God can be such a hater sometimes. I brought you a few things. Ooh, Cassie. Thank you. Hey, I'm in the mood for a good joke. Do you know any good jokes, Leon? Well, I might be able to come up with something. Ah. Do you know why your butt crack goes like this and not like this? Why? 'Cause if it went like this and you fell down the stairs, you'd go... Tell me another one. Susan? Oh, good, you're back. What are you doing here? Visiting a friend. Don't worry. This is my little brother. Get out. Your brother's my doctor? Physician's assistant. Well, I have some good news for you, Leon. You're gonna get to go home to that building soon 'cause we're letting you out of here today. Oh, goody. Just promise me to be a little better about staying on top of your blood sugar, okay? And do you have anybody who can check in on you? - Yes, he does. - Anybody responsible? - Yes. - Who? Can I see you in the hallway, please? If you could just take a quick look through these, get your John Hancock, we should be all set, yeah? - What is your problem? - I know what you're up to. Oh, yeah? What am I up to? You're gonna try to befriend him. Well, I already am his friend, so check. Then you're gonna figure out a way to mooch off this poor guy just like you do with everyone else in your life. Jesus, Susan, what the hell? This is where I work, for Christ's sake. Has it ever occurred to you that I might actually care about him? Ha! That's the funniest thing I've ever heard. You don't care about anyone but yourself. You never have. You know what? You are never not an asshole. You know it's true. Oh, that's nice. Walk away. Like father, like daughter, I guess. You know what? I never blamed Dad for leaving like you and Mom always did. You know why? Because it was smart for him to leave. I would have left, too, if I wound up with a fucking retarded family like this one! It's meatloaf day in the cafeteria. Your retarded family called to tell you about it, but it went to voicemail. All right, loaf time. It's okay, sweetie. Everything all right? Everything's fine. - Hey. - Hey, dude. What are you doing out here? I know they can be a little retarded. Sometimes I wanna leave too. Don't ever do that. They love you. They love you too. Don't say retarded. Jenika, don't skip in the hospital. Oh, hi, Susan. I'm sorry for what I said back there. But I'm not gonna say I didn't mean it because I kinda did mean it. I'm happy y'all had a fun vacation. Y'all worked hard for it and deserve it. Mom, I'm sorry you picked a favorite child and that he turned out to be a stuck-up piece of shit. I'm sorry you never told me I was awesome when I was a kid even though it would have been a lie. I'm sorry you had to raise two children on your own because you married a "selfish asshole," and I'm sorry you think I can be a little bit like him sometimes, but the truth is... I think I'm probably a little more like you. It's something I'm working on. Enjoy your family meal. At least she didn't ask for money. Good lord. You okay? Yeah. Are you okay? Oh, me? I'm good. I could probably use a soda or something to get my sugar back up, but I can wait till we get back to the house for that. ♪ I'm about to set off ♪ ♪ Mm, yeah ♪ ♪ I never felt so good ♪ ♪ I'm about to break off ♪ ♪ Mm, yeah ♪ ♪ I never felt so good ♪ ♪ I'm not trying to hide it ♪ ♪ I'm not trying to deny it ♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

Is there anything else Kmart should know about you before we conclude this interview? All right then. Just... Just that I've always been jealous of you because your life always seemed so perfect, you know? You always seem so happy, and you're so pretty, and in high school you were in that commercial for Mattress Giant. - You saw that? - Yeah.

I see you left the box unchecked for "Have you ever been convicted of a crime?" Yes, I, as of now, technically never have been convicted of a crime. However, I do have an upcoming court date. That's okay, Susan. I know all about it. - You do? - I saw you on the news. I was on the news? I posted your bail. - Why? - I don't know. Look, Phil Conklin's a slimy little dick. - I'm sure he had it coming. - You know Phil? I made the mistake of going on one date with him when I was rebounding.
