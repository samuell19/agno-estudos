Hey guys! Guys! Guys! Guys! Guys! Hello! Any body home! Guys! Hey guys! Guys seriously this isn't funny! Guys! Hello! Are we playing hide and seek? Where are you guys at seriously! Marco! Guys! Where m I? What are you going to do to me? Yeah, Just got here. Na the place looks totally amazing. Yep, Clean, air conditioned and relaxing...Ya I told you it would be great... Ok Look, I'm going to meet the real estate lady and give her the check, So let me call you back. All right by? Ya. A guy could definitely get some work done in a place like this. It gets better and better. It just gets better and better. Like what you see? Sorry... I didn't expect you... Um... Are you... Evelyn. Yes. We exchanged E-Mails. We did. Sorry for staring. I dont see many people around here. Its alright. We all space out sometimes. Right? We do. So, Im guessing you don't get a lot of people renting this place, No. I don't know why! New Mexico is just so beautiful though. Its in the middle of nowhere. The desert. Not a lot of pedestrian traffic. Yaa, This house is great. It is. Maybe I could show you around? See if you any... questions. Let's start with the upstairs. I hope your friends like the bedrooms. Are you kidding? We're all grad students... We're used to sleeping on floors and couches. Where is it you go to university? Colorado. Well Denver. Wow,You're a long way from home. Ya its more of a working, studying kind of vacation. What are you studying? Ohh.. Im sorry em i asking too many questions. It just gets a little... lonely out here some times. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm studying. Biocultural Anthropology... Theoretical Biocultural Anthropology. That sounds mysterious. No not really. It's just the research of two cultures and how they affect each other. Especially when a more technologically advanced culture begins to research and collect data. On a more primitive one.. Kinda like how the Pilgrims did with the Indians. What's theoretical about that? Umm, I'm also interested in how a culture might research us. Us? Human beings. It's also known as Xenoanthropology.. The study of alien cultures. Aliens? How fascinating. Really?See i usually have to dance around the whole little green men/ Ufo idea. Its not some thing that they like giving out PhD's for. Because it's so far fetched? Something like that. And I may sound like a crazy person . I Guess.. I don't think it sound crazy at all. See i love hearing that. That's why I chose this place. I'm taking a side trip to Roswell tomorrow. Really? Im hoping something is there I can use for my dissertation.. and just something that will make me sound less like a crazy person. There's a place near by you should check out called Corona? Corona? It's where the actual 'Roswell' UFO crash took place. Ok... I didn't know that. Thanks.. It's not my favorite place. There's not much there. Should we check out the pool. Not a fan of the sun, huh? No. Yeah, me either. I burn like crazy. The spa and pool should be in great working order. I did have a man come out to service them. Great I probably won't be using them much, but I'm sure my friends will. So, that's the place. I hope you like it. Ya t's perfect. There's something I didn't mention in our correspondence, however. What's that? I use the last spare room upstairs as something of office. I didn't mention it in the listing. Im sure you can understand why. The owners don't mind? Oh the owners are never here... Or are almost never here. What, They trave or? I hope you don't mind if I do a little work here during the week. I promise, you will never know I'm here. It's not a problem at all. Im sure my friends won't mind. Well then t hat concludes our business. The check...? Oh, Sorry.. And if i where you I would recommend the spoils of war. The what? Claim the master bedroom. Thank you. Willie, George... How was the trip? Man It sucked. Had to listen to this guy's tunes the whole time. He's a stiff. I had to listen to Willie bitch about my tunes the entire trip. You know what what ever I'm just glad you're here. How did i do? You said this place has internet access, right? Uhh, Ya As far as I know. Geez man listen to Grandpa over here, already thinking about work. Yo man two things how's the pool ? And where's the beer at? Pools good! ya awesome.. I need a dip so lets go... Ohhh come on you two? They'll be plenty of time to study and write your papers and pretend any of it matters. I need a dip now... let's go! Wow, You finally did something right for once.. been in yet? Naa. I'll go change. Oh, hell no don't be a wimp man ill get in right now lets go! Yoo, Man how'd you find this place? You know it was the Weirdest thing, I put my email up on a few vacation rental boards and Wam... Evelyn found me. Who's Evelyn? Yeah... about that... Oh, Great here's comes the catch. I told you for this price there'd be a catch. Nah its just she uses the last room upstairs as an office. And she's a little odd... Is she's here? As far as i know. Is she hot? Kinda... In a MILF-y kind of way. Nice thats the kind of catch that Daddy like. I'm heading to my room. I got work to do. Yaa.. Of course you do. Find my own room? Ya you have plenty of choices. Yaa I gotta change too. I'm headed to Roswell. Research. Ya all work and no play, Adam. We'll have plenty of time for that later.. Do me a favor and tell the others about Evelyn when they get here? Yeah sure.. Yo hey which room is she staying in? Last room, second floor.. Cool i'll be taking the room next door. Feeling kinda lucky.. What are you doing? Shh, I'm trying to working my mojo. What ever i'm heading off to Roswell. I'll be back this afternoon. Dana should be here soon, Max and Jack in a few hours. Hey,Hey, Thanks for putting this together. Ya, Ya no worries i'm just glad it worked out. Evelyn? New Mexico is a state strongly imbued with a history of culture clashes. Multiple Native American tribes shared and warred over the lands for thousands of years The arrival of Coronado brought Spanish occupation. Mexico ceded from Spain, claiming the land as its own. Over the ensuing years, both France and the Republic of Texas would claim portions of it. And finally, the United States would exercise its control of the area by buying the land, fighting its own wars and ultimately eradicating and relocating many of the original Native populations. With all of this history, would it then be so out of line to assume that the most alien of cultures might also come here to explore, research and stake its own claim for dominance? Hello? Anyone body home? Then I claim this land for me. Hello...? Hey, Willie-boy. Yo, Dana man, do yourself a favor, take a load off and jump into the.... ..or don't listen to me. So what's the haps? Adam's out on some research field trip,George is up in his term paper so you know we won't even see him for the rest of the week. And oh yeah, there's some mysterious MILF who may or may not be here doing... Something. Is there beer? That's all I needed to know. Be a good boy and grab me one. Evelyn? Want a beer? Roswell, New Mexico. In 1947 an alien spacecraft was reported to have crash landed in the region and the alien occupants taken away by the military in an incident they later reported was the crash of a weather balloon. The conspiracy theories continue to this day, leading the town's very name to conjure images of alien contact more than any city in America. And over the years, the town has been happy to cash in on the notoriety. Guess who is here you all... Adam i usually get a reaction out of that.. Here buddy! Hiding from me huh! I know you didn't get that drunk last night! Where the girls at? You hidding! Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam... got to tell you though this place is pretty nice But has the most random stuff here though.. Where is this fool! Adam is right here.. Nope.. Hhmmm.. Nobody,, Huhhh Huhhh Get my work out on.. You know Its time for some ladys.. Sexy ladys.. {Singing} Alright.. He's probably watching me right now.. Ohhh Yaa.. Ohhh Yaa.. Burning the muscle.. Oh Yaaa.. That doesn't feel like that much to me right now. Hahha Gotch ya... Not sure if you think this is funny man... But I ain't laughing.. Yo Adam..Where you at fool! Playing hide and seek is kinda ridiculous.. Nope .. Alright dude. Thats i nice view out there. Lets see if this fools out here! Adam come on man! Where you at! Ok guys.. This is not funny! Come on guys! You know i don't like being strapped. Guys.. Ouchh... Come on guys! Adam! Adam! Come on! This is not cool! Adam! Hello! Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! What is this? Adam! Adam! What are you trying to do to me? Is this some kind of joke? What is this? Adam ! Adam ! Terrestrial explorers and anthropologists throughout the ages have several things in common, at least the ones we we can qualify as successful. Unlike the ones found in movies, they don't come in, guns blazing, anarchy and pillaging their only goal. They instead arrive peacefully, doing their best to learn about this new society; to fit in as best they can. They engage learning and assessing and doing their best to understand a given culture and its people. I believe the same could be said for extra- terrestrial explorers. Hello? I just spoke to Willie on the phone. He and Dana and George are here somewhere. No, we're not? Willie-boy, how's it going? Whats man... Look at this place,How do you think its going ? Ya no kidding. Adam did something right. Finally!! So what's the catch? Hey don't be such a hater. Besides, I asked about that already. The only thing we got to worry about is some mystery MILF around here. I haven't been able to find her yet but. Otherwise, Man go nuts. I'm gonna take a nap. Where's Dana? OHH, He's In the gym man... Yeah, There's a gym. Nice. Ohh hey also I recommend getting in the pool now. If you don't, you're a douche. Well, we don't want that. See ya in a little bit? Fair enough. Hey,, Max has arrived. Evelyn... You in there. You know most of the guys are here and I'd hate for you to accidentally see any of us naked... Or anything. There's no towels here. So. That's what the sun's for. Take a load off. I should get some work done. I have two research papers to write. That's why we're here isn't it? Yeah, Yeah. There's plenty of time to be productive. Creativity takes patience, it takes time for the cake to rise. What the hell are you talking about? You're a finance major. Yeah, and I like cake, now just drip-dry and stop interrupting my chi.. Im sorry didn't mean to startle you. No... it's fine. I'm Evelyn. your friends might have told you I might be working around here for a bit. Yeah. No problem. Nice place. Yes, It is. I'm glad your friend found me. It's meant to be. It's safe to assume an alien culture visiting Earth has technology far outpacing ours. And if they can make it to our planet, wouldn't they also explore the myriad other planets capable of sustaining life? So, my hypothesis is this: Alien explorers would best be served by covert intelligence gathering. Living among us, studying us, gathering samples; basic anthropological study. They would no doubt build data for a report that would be used to help ascertain what their leaders should do next. And what are the possibilities for Earth's survival? Given the human species own track record for treating indigenous peoples, I don't think it will be pretty. Yo man what happened? It's Max. I just took a nap and when I came back I found him like this. Max,come on man! Max! His breathing and pulse seem to be fine. Did he fall down and hit his head, maybe? Max! It looks like a puncture wound! How the hell do you know that? I watch a lot of Law & Order. Look,This is out of my league. I need you to go in and call an ambulance.Max! Shit! It's inside me... Max! Yo Man, what's inside you? Talk to me Max. Max! Don't go in there... What.. Jack! Jack! Dana! George! Where are you! All! Jack!! What the hell Jack! Jack, Hey stay with me man.. Hey, Who did this to you?-- --I did it to Willie. And now I'm going to do it to you. Oh it's your friend -- Adam. I look forward to hearing what he found in Roswell. Why are you doing this? What happened to my friends? Where did they go? So full of questions. It's something I admire about you, Even in the face of your own extinction. What are you talking about? I've already said too much. But i want you to know you where sacrifice and the sacrifice of your friends has done so much to aid our cause; scientifically, potential technological advances, natural resources. You have so much to offer us. You're crazy you know that. I'm a scientist. And frankly, i cant wait to get out of this ridiculous 'costume' and off this terrible outpost,Ohh im so sorry. That really was unbecoming of my station. Why's he like that? What did you do to him? Jack! Jack! Wake up man! Stop shouting. Your friend is done. I've already extracted what I needed from him and already administered the sleeping agent. What are you talking about? What does that mean? What's going on? Where are my friends? I really don't like to discuss it with subjects, as it tends to make them a tencey bit over-anxious. But since you're such an inquisitive one, I'll tell you. My form allows me remarkable trust. I simply ask for the help of a strong young man for help. They can never says 'no.' Sometimes it's easier to just incapacitate a subject, particularly if the examination is more physical in nature. I mostly require various samples of brain tissue, sentient- electrical data and the like. It's a primarily painless process. Your friends are all dead or dying of course. A by-product of the research, but not unappreciated. Now do you have any other questions? So lets begin shall we? Guys this isn't funny? Hello! ...Please let this be a joke.. A really bad joke... Adam. Hello!! Where are my friends? How was Roswell? Find everything you needed? Are they pulling some kind of prank or some thing. Oh there around. I think they said something about beer. That's must be it. Come inside, Tell me about it. Im very interested about it.. But its very bright out today. Come tell me.. Could you help me? There's a box of files I'd like to put in my closet up in room. But It's too heavy for me. Ya sure.. Ok... You know.. Where are my friends? Oh, Adam. You are usually much less difficult than this. Ouchhh... What are you doing? I'm trying to reveres your treatment. And it would have worked allot better if you wouldn't have pulled away.. Before I could fully inject you... Adam. Please. What did you do to me? You have work to do 'Adam.' We have work to do. What are you... This should be our final round of gathering data. Then we can go home. We don't belong here, 'Adam.' You know this. We have work to do. No... I'm human... I'm... No... You just need to rest. Then you'll remember.. Are you still 'Adam?' I gave you enough TrixelMethulose to be able to reverse the persona by now. Your other persona's were much less difficult.. Who am I? You are exactly the thing you are so fascinated by. You've bin manta personas. You've been a pilot, a mailman, a government agent, a veterinarian... and now a student. All have bin very very helpful in obtaining samples. and verbose other useful data... Where are my... Those... Other men? They've sacrificed themselves for the greater good. But don't worry I've harvested great portions of their brain matter, And managed to save most of there intellectual pursuits for study at later time. They're dead? You know as well as I do, even our technology can only keep a partially functioning human alive for so long. And Their bodies are terably frail. We have work to do... Yes. A job... Infiltrate... Gather... Report... Yes, Yes...You the real you, is coming back? The real me... Yes, Perhaps a booster, Just to be sure.. I know who I am... Good. Then this should sort you out. Why?... ...I know who I am...
