Come on! Sarah Are you ever coming out of there? You're not the only one that lives in this house, you know! Uh, yeah mam. I'll be out in a second. I'm washing my face. Sarah? Sarah, are you ok? Have you even been listening to a word I was saying? I'm sorry mam, it's just... It's just that boy you've been hanging out with... He's filling your head with all sorts of nonsense. Jesus Christ, mam... Do not take the lords name in vain! Sorry. It's not Shane, it's just... I've got a lot on my plate right now... Well maybe if you focused a little bit more on your college work Then you wouldn't be in this... Sarah?! Bye, mam! Sarah. Sarah!? Get back here! Look... I know you've an awful lot on your mind at the moment... But I am your mother and you WILL listen to me! Do you hear me? Yeah. Look I'm gonna be late for class... Right, well I'll pick you up at the usual place, yeah? Actually, I'm gonna go for coffee with the lads... So, I'll see ya later. Love you! Love you too... Seven weeks... What? We used protection. Every time. Miss Dekker. No contraception is a hundred percent. There's always the risk... Look, Sarah... Is there anybody you could talk to? Your parents? My parents... they'll kill me. Well, what about the father? You need to talk to him. Sarah!? What?! You're saying you're feeling weird and you just kinda... Look Sar, I wanted to talk to you about something... I just feel that this thing we have, going on... It's not going anywhere. Ya know? Wait, what?! I just have a lot of life shit to be figuring out at the moment, and I don't want to be distracting you from your college work and it just feel's like over the past while we've been... Sinking... Drowning. I don't know to explain it... But I feel it and I think you do too. Yeah... Look, I'm not saying... We need to end things... I just think that a little bit of space, a little bit of time apart, would be good for us. Fine! Look, sorry Sar, but We need this. I mean... We good? It's Davet. He's come to collect me. You know, I could take you home if you want? Sarah, just call me if you need anything, yeah?! Sarah, I still care about you so fucking much. Just call me if you need anything OK? Sarah?! Sorry... So, you guys just... Broke up? Yeah. What the fuck?! Ye were going so well and all. I know, I guess now I know if things got hard, he wouldn't stick around. You didn't... You didn't cheat on him did you? No, you spa! I'm just saying, it's clear now that we don't have a future... Maybe ye just need some time apart? I don't think so Davet. Not anymore. Still, now there's nothing stopping me doing... What I need to do. Stopping you from what?! Sarah, you are saying shit that means nothing to me! Will you just tell me what's going on? I will... I promise. Thanks for the lift. Do you want me to, kick his ass or something? That's what... Friends say, right? I think we both know how that would end out? Thanks for the offer, though. Mam? Dad? Don't go and do anything rash. Elaine?! Elaine, please? You good for nothing little tramp! I knew it. I knew what you were up to! Let me explain. Let you explain? Let you explain!?! You make it sound so easy, Sarah! I have done my best to stop you going down a bad path. Away from the lord! But you just seem... Drawn to the darkness! And now... You just want to defy me. You want to provoke me! And now this! It wasn't like that mam, We used protection, every time! Every time? Elaine!? She's a grown woman, it's only natura- Oh it's natural Richard? It's natural for her to have sex before marriage? Natural for her to have a baby out of wedlock? Natural for you to bring shame on your family because, That's what you've done. You've brought shame on all of us! Please mam, it was an accident... And now this... An Abortion, Sarah!!! I didn't want anyone to know, I didn't want to hurt you or dad, I just wanted everything to go back to norma... Elaine?! Enough! Sarah... You, tell no one... and don't you ever come around me, or your father ever again, do you hear me? My whole life, you've tried to control me... That's what you hate about this, that you can't control it! Don't you dare... I don't care anymore mam. I'm sick of you and your religious bullshit, you can't just send me off to a laundry... Let go, of my arm... I'll do what I have to do. With or without you. And I'll never come around you again, you know why? Elaine? Sarah? Please, just... Even though, I've made the decision to give this baby up, I'm still a better mother than you... Get out of my house, NOW!!! Dad, I can't... It's fine. Honestly, it's grand. Just let me ask, are you sure this is what you want? I pulled some strings with a friend, at a clinic in Liverpool. He can fit you in. If that's what you want. If not, don't worry. It's up to you, Sarah. I think I better, better get back, just let me know if you need anything. I'll try and talk to your mother, try and calm her down. Thanks. Hey Sar, just giving you a quick call to see how you're getting on? I know you need space right now, so I won't hound ya. You're mother is, well... You know her well enough by now. I was just... worried about you. I know your mother is too, even if she won't admit it. Just please, give me a call, whenever you feel ready. But call me at work, it's just safer that way... I, uh, I... Talk to you soon, Sarah. Hey. It's me. Look, I think we made a mistake. I was hoping we could talk, spoke to Davet and he said he hadn't heard from ya. What was that?! What? Nothing. I think you need some sleep, Sarah. I'm not tired. Just call me when you get a chance, OK. I... I love you, Sarah. Jesus... Yeah, he was the previous landlord. You know him? Smart arse. You only love it! Hey, miss you... Can we talk soon? So... We have red wine... Or red wine? And if you're feeling very adventurous, there's a bottle of Poitín out there. Ew. Are you serious about the Poitín? Yeah, It's under the sink. Think it was used as like, paint stripper or something? I'll have that so. Sarbear? You can't be serious?! You want Irish moonshine over... Oh shit, you are serious... OK then. Poitín it is. You really are knackered aren't ya? Maybe we leave the drinks for tonight? Nope! And the old, Triangle. He went jingle, jangle! All along, the banks, of the royal, Canal. How did you tell your parents? Tell my parents what? That you're gay. Well it wasn't hard. They had their suspicions. But, they were OK with it. They weren't angry or anything? Well dad took it harder, obviously. He always wanted me to be the "Manly Man". Took me fishing. Hunting. Shite like that. I liked spending time with him though. And they didn't feel like, you betrayed them. Sarah? Please. Do you know how happy mam was to have a gay son? It's all the rage. I was like a fucking fashion accessory. Imagine her disappointment, when I wasn't a "Stereotypical" gay man. And dad? Well, he'd two more sons. Imagine you were an only child. I guess... Sarah, they're your parents, you know they love you. My mam said that I brought, shame upon the family. Dad took it OK I guess, he even helped sort out the procedure. But, now... Uh, Sarah, what the FUCK!? My parents might be OK with my sexuality, but if they thought I was fuckin' smoking, they'd CRUCIFY me! Fine. For now! So, Shane's been calling. Talk to him. He know's he's fucked up. I'm not ready to talk. Not now. I'm sorry So, was the Poitín really a good idea? I feel like shite. Will you turn the radio off, please? I already feel like puking. Someone's a little grumpy. Aw, now I'm definitely gonna puke... Come on, A fry is your only cure. All that grease and carbs, will soak up all that excess alcohol, you'll feel better in no time. It's science or something. Didn't you fail science? You said you'd never tell. Uh huh! Science, bitch! I suppose, it's not as bad as it looks. I was thinking, since we're so near the coast, we could go to the beach? Once I've had time to wake up. Sounds like a plan. Finish your food though first, yeah? Jesus Christ! Why the... What the... Davet!? Relax, would ya? Looks like a baby crow or something? Must be learning how to fly. It happens... They don't know what windows are, poor things. You're alright. She's not gonna text you back. Might be busy. I'm off them. Nigel and I are trying... Have you talked to Richard or Elaine? Yeah, I called Elaine... She hung up on me. That woman is a proper stuck up cunt! Come on. You have Sarah and her family on some sort of fucking pedestal, Even after all the shit that she's put you through, all the cancelled dinners, all the times she left you hanging. What Elaine said to ya... I'm sorry. She's done this before. She's gone off for days. Weeks even and I'm the one left to pull you through. Yeah? Well, I broke up with her... OK, so this ones on me. Ya can't add this to the list of reasons why you hate her so much... No, Shane. Shane wait, you're my brother... I'm just trying to... I don't hate her. I just know what she's really like. I'm gonna, call by the house. See if I can talk to Richard. Nigel and I will keep asking around, but will you just think about what I said. This is not the first time she's been selfish. There you go again. Alright, goodbye sis. All of a sudden going down on me, I'm like jesus, it's the middle of the nightclub! There were suds. It was a foam party so you couldn't really see. Wildest thing. The funniest part is, I didn't even know I was gay at the time! Talk about putting your foot in it Uh, or in my case, Your penis. Don't you hear that. The song? Yeah she's from Limerick. She's deadly isn't she?! I love this tune. I think she's playing Dolan's soon actually... Sarah? What? Sarah?! What the fuck SARAH?! Oh jesus. Oh jesus is right! What is going on? The nurse said this could happen. So that's normal?! Yeah?!? No?! I dunno. She said it could happen for a few weeks. Can we stop at the next shop? Ah, yes. Yes, we can! Hi, how's it going? C'mere. Is she OK man? Uh, yeah. She's grand. Thanks. So, that'll be twenty four euros, so, please. So, you just passing through or what? I'm staying at my parents house. Oh, local is it? The Old Parochial house up in Kilmihil. That place? Seriously? Yeah? Well, people talk about that place around here. It used to be ah, one of those mother and baby homes. Has a bit of a reputation, you know? Small town. People talk. Yeah, well, you're a braver man than I am. Fuck knows what kind of shit happened there! Uh yeah... Do ye take card? Uh... No. There's an ATM just down there though. Yeah. Take yer time... Sarah it's me mum. I think it's time we talked. Who the fuck do you... Shane?! Richard, is um, Sarah home? Who is it Richard? Uh, nobody. Just somebody, switching the uh, broadband. Didn't she tell you? No, no. I haven't spoken to her in about a week... Sarah and Elaine had a huge fight, she's down at Davet's until all this blows over. A fight? Over what? You really don't know? She found out, about the pregnancy... Shane, Selling Broadband is he? She's not here Shane, and even if she was, if you think, I would ever let her talk to you again after what you've done, you've got another thing coming. Elaine please, look he was just... I know exactly what he was like, Richard. She's not welcome here and neither are you. I'm sorry Elaine, I didn't... You didn't what? You didn't knock up my daughter? I knew exactly what you were like, the first minute I laid eyes on you Shane Daly. Now, get off my property before I call the guards. Richard! Shane Daly Hello? Hey man, how are ya? Sorry for calling you so late. Um, is Sarah with you? She's actually... She's actually in the bath. Yeah. Ok well, listen can you just ask her to give me a call? I tried ringing her there but... It just went straight to voicemail. I just, stopped by her house and well, I... I just, uh, really need to talk to her. I think her phones dead, and I've no credit... so when she get's out of the bath, I'll tell her to charge it and give you a call. Yeah OK thanks man. Cheers. I appreciate it. No worries man. Bye, bye, buh-buh-bye, buh-bye. I wasn't smoking... Yeah... Right. So, Shane just called. Yeah. What did he say? He said he stopped by your place. Met your parents. And that he really needs to talk. Fuck. Do you think he spoke to my parents? Davet, do you think he knows? I dunno Sarah, but what I do know is, you need to talk to him. Davet. I'm not ready, yet. Well, I dunno what to say Sarah?! He rang, I said you were in the bath and that you'd call him. You HAVE to call him! Why?! Why would you do that? I thought you were looking out for me! I am Sarah! I am! But you need to talk to him and sort this out! We came here to get away for a weekend, get you back on your feet. We can't stay here forever! You said to take as long as I needed! Well, some of us have lives to get back to Sarah! Look, you need to talk to him. I'm sorry, Sarah. Yeah... You're right. I will, call him tomorrow... and let you, get back, to your life... Tar Amach Sar? What's wrong? Sarah? SARAH?!? Sarah, I'm coming, Sarah! Sarah! SARAH!!! SARAH!?! It's OK... It's OK. I'm here. Oh, jesus... Well these clothes are fit for the bin. So I went through your discharge papers, and verified it all online. Everything that happened, was perfectly normal. Normal? Normal!?! What about what fucking happened was normal, Davet? The bleeding, Sarah! You said it yourself. It can happen a few weeks after the procedure. That thing... It crawled, inside me. It was just a bad dream, I had one too. Thought I saw something, it was chasing me. It's just the storm... Thunder and Lightning. It felt, so real... I know but Sarah, please... The medication you're on... and the alcohol. So you really think it was all in my head? I turned that room inside out, and didn't see as much as a spider. So, yeah... I think not telling Shane, it's fucking with your head. Making you see things, feel things, that just aren't there. Look, tomorrow go to the hospital. Talk to a professional. No, Davet. We've been through this. I'm not ready to go back out, I can't face everything. I think that's the problem, darling. Look, Davet... I'll call Shane. I will... Do you wanna stay in my bedroom tonight? I can always sleep on the day bed. It's fine. It's fine. I'm fine! I'm good. It's OK. Alright. Night Sarbear. Night. I love you. I love you too. Morning. I'm so sorry, if I came on a little strong... I meant what I said from the start, you can stay here as long as you need to... I know you're only looking out for me. I shouldn't have gotten angry at you for taking Shane's call... If it makes you feel better, I won't take his calls. Next time he rings, I won't answer... Don't be ridiculous, if Shane calls you, you answer it. Just tell him that I'm not ready yet, and I will call him when I am. OK. So, last night, after our... chat, Marco called me. Was that yer man from Venice? The love of your life? Everyone you meet in Europe is the love of your life. But for me, Marco really was. What was it you called him? An adonis? Shut up you. But yeah, that Marco. He flies into Ireland, tomorrow, from Treviso! Are you meeting up with him? I'd love to... But I told him I was busy. Jesus, Davet... Don't worry about me. You, said it yourself last night... We have our lives to get back to. I'll be fine. Honestly... Are you sure? I mean, yesterday at the shop... Yeah... I just think, being here, I feel safe. I feel safe here. Besides, if I really need you, you'll only be a few hours away. Right? Right! Aw, Sarbear, you're the best. I don't know what it is about him, he just... Maybe, she's just upset, ya know? I mean, her mam did kick her out. Yeah, that and I broke up with her when she was pregnant. No, you should have seen her she was acting weird. I should've fucking known... How? You couldn't have! Look man... I don't wanna be telling you your business now or anything, but... You just need to let her be. Put it out of your mind. Put it out of my fucking mind? Are you serious man? I just mean that she needs space... You're the one that told me ye did. Yeah, that was before I knew anything about this! OK. What did Davet say anyway? He just said her phone was dead. That was it. So, she knows you're looking for her now, yeah? Yeah. Well then, when she's ready to talk, she'll let ya know. I'm sure of it. Maybe you're right, yeah. Listen, just do me a favour man. Don't tell Rebecca about any of this OK? I won't man. Sure Rebecca has enough on her mind now anway What you mean? Oh nothing, it's just, just work and... she's just had a lot on, ya know? Here will you check Maps there? See where we're sending this stuff? Are you sure you're gonna be alright? I'll be fine you big eejit! Go get your man! Call me. If you need anything. I'm serious! I will. I love you, Sarbear. I love you, too. You have reached the phone voicemail service of... Davet Lynch can't come to the phone right now. Please leave your message after the beep. Get out of my head!! Sarah Sarah? Of course. Where are ya? Wow... Charming place. Uh, do you want something to drink? Yeah, I'll make a coffee. You want one? I'm fine. My stomachs been acting up. The sugars in the press, and... the milk... is here. So, how've ya been? You look, um... Like shite? Well, I was gonna say tired but... Yeah. I'm exhausted. So, how've you been? Enjoying the break? Well, I've been... I've been worried about ya. Right after that day in the cafe I just kept thinking, did I make a massive mistake? But then I knew I couldn't just call ya, because I was the one that said we needed space. So, um... I stopped by your mam and dads the other day, just to see if you were OK. Yeah? Yeah... Your dad, he said, um... He said... You and your mam had a massive fight. Yeah. She's not exactly the most understanding person is she? You OK? It's just my teeth. They've been fucking killing me... Shit why haven't you got it looked at? I don't need a dentist, Shane. I'm happy here. I'm not ready to go back to it all. Not yet. Look Sarah, I get that but... Your dad, he... He told me everything. He did? What's that noise? Do you... Do you hear that noise? Look, anyway, I dunno why you didn't just, come to me and discuss it. Well I did! I tried, I came to you, but you kinda broke up with me. I didn't know at that stage what was... Where the fuck is that sound coming from? You knew you didn't want to be with me. No, I knew that we needed space. And I gave you space. I gave you exactly what you fucking wanted Shane, I did what I had to. OK.OK. And I appreciate that, Sarah. I do. But you wanted to talk and I'm here now, so let's talk. Look, I want ya to know... That I'm willing to do everything I can for us... For our family. Sarah, you hear that as well yeah? Sarah, you hear that? Sarah? Sarah, you OK? Sarah, what's wrong? Sar? Shane... Shane?! Hang up the phone. Sar, you're bleeding. There's noises... Shane, put down the phone. You can't call anyone. Sarah what's wrong? What's going on? Shane, I had an abortion. You alright? I suppose it can't hurt now, can it? How far along were ya? Seven, nearly eight weeks... Look, Shane, I had to do it. I wanted to do it. We'd broken up. My mam had pulled me by the hair, and kicked me out of my house. I had no one. You know if you had just, um, if you'd just said that day in the cafe that you were pregnant, things would have been different. Things would have been different, Shane, but they wouldn't have been better. We had to break up. We needed to. You're the one who keeps calling it a break up. Well, whatever it was, Shane... If I had told you I was pregnant, you would have been over the moon, you would have been delighted and I would've been heartbroken. I would've been heartbroken, if I... If I had tried to tell you I didn't want it. Yeah, but what if I did? OK, we should've at least discussed it. But you didn't give me that choice... You didn't give our baby, a choice. Shane? You were right. We were drifting apart. We needed to take a break. We did. If I'd told you I was pregnant we would've stayed together, and we would've broken up, eventually, and I would've been the one picking up the pieces. Oh no, fuck this OK. You keep using this whole breakup thing, as a means to highroad me, it's bollocks! I'm not trying to highroad you, Shane! Alright? I'm just saying... If I had told you, If I had given you that choice, I truly believe, in my heart and soul... That, that I wouldn't have had a choice. It's just, when your dad told me you were pregnant, I was.. Shane... Look, I mean, I did what I had to do. Right, I, I don't regret it. I regret hurting you, I'm sorry I should've told you sooner. I made my decision. I didn't want this baby. It doesn't mean I never want kids, I just... Just, not now. Sarah? Sarah, what's going on? Is it getting worse? Sarah? Sarah? Oh, my stomach. Fuck! Sarah, what's going on? What's going on? It's so bad, the pain. The pain, fuck! Lie down, lie down, lie down. Sarah! Sarah! Rebecca? I need ya. Shane... My eyes... Sarah, it's OK. It's OK. Can I? You said she had a procedure? How far along was she?? She wasn't like this when I called ya. Shane, what's happening? OK Sar, Rebecca's here to help, OK? Man, you don't get a belly like that after a couple of hours... Sarah? How far along were ya? I need you to be honest with me, OK? I was just seven weeks. Just, seven weeks! Sarah, I need you to be honest with me, because late term abortions they... I am being fucking honest! She really wasn't like this when I called you. OK. Do you have any discharge papers? Davet had them. They're in his room in a brown envelope. Hun, can you? Yeah, I'm on it, yeah. Sar? What the fuck? What's going on? Whoa, whoa, whoa. OK. Sarah, you probably shouldn't be moving until we figure out what's going on here. I just want to go to the kitchen, Have a smoke, maybe get a glass of water. OK, I'll take you. OK. Come here. Shane? Will you run to the car and grab my bag? Fuck! Pain? It's kind of better now. It's like really bad cramps. Here. Will you keep an eye on Shane? Yeah. Like period pains? That's totally normal... And I've been bleeding... I had a bleed tonight when I told Shane? Also normal, that can happen for... for a few weeks after the procedure, I know, the nurse said. Seven weeks... Ok, is there anything else? Apart from the pain, the bleeding, the stomach? The stomach is what has me worried. Nothing I can think of. Except... What? Go on. I had this, really vivid nightmare. Where this, creature, crawled inside me. Well I guess you were feeling guilty. And it manifested itself that way, babies, invading your body, protection. It felt, so real... I mean, not telling Shane. Whether or not he agreed with your choice, you didn't give him a chance. I knew I couldn't, I knew he'd... What? Want to keep his baby? That's a normal response, Sarah. Excuse me? You know there are people out there, who want babies. People who've lost children and you, you just... I made my choice. I didn't want THIS baby, not now! Well, I wanted my baby! Is everything OK? Bekka? Bekka, what is it? What's going on? I thought I was over it. Bekka, are you OK? Hey, hey, what's wrong? What's wrong? I lost a baby. A few months ago... Ah jesus guys, I'm so sorry. I didn't know. That's OK man. We didn't tell anyone. Sarah, I'm sorry for, freaking out like that... No, please. Don't apologise. I'm sorry. I didn't know. Are you OK? I mean it like, are you really OK? Yeah. Guys, I think it's better if I talk to her alone. Yeah, no problem. Did you guys hear that sound... before we came in? You heard that too? Ah, look, it's an old house, and we've a lot going on so. We'll be just in the other room if ye need us, OK? Is there anything else? Besides what we've talked about. Maybe... My teeth? They've been, really sore since I got the... That seems unrelated. Have you had issues with your teeth before? No, they've always been perfect. That's why it's so weird... Ok, well I'm not a dental nurse, but your teeth look really weak, like your left molar looks like it's gonna fall out. It's been horrible, and my, my boobs, have been, really bad. They've been killing me. Well that's really weird I mean, your breasts become swollen during pregnancy. I mean your teeth can get weak because, the baby takes the vitamins but... You're not pregnant, so I... What? Sarah, what? Sarah, what is it? Oh, jesus christ! OK, Sarah, let's go sit down. Jesus, Sarah! What's wrong with her? I don't know. We were talking, she just started screaming! Should we take her to the hospital? The nearest hospital's hours away! Rebecca, the pain... It hurts so bad. OK. Bekka? Rebecca? They're contractions. That's not possible. It can't be... What the fuck? Jesus christ, Bekka what are you doing? Shane, what's going on? Rebecca, what the fuck are you doing? You stay away! The babies are coming. They need their mother, they all died here. Bekka, please... The mothers... They all came here. But the babies never left... Now they'll leave. She's their vessel and I'm their mother! Rebecca, what the fuck are you talking about? This isn't funny! Shane!? Please... It feeds on guilt. First hers, then yours, but it's my guilt, my desire for a baby that will set it free. They were denied life!! Bekka, you're not making any sense, Rebecca, please... Rebecca, I don't... I can't. Fuck this! Go play! Come on Sarah. MOVE! The door won't fuckin' open! Open the fuckin' door, Nigel. Fuck. FUCK! Shane? Shane?!? What Sarah, what? What the fuck do you want? Shane? NIGEL!?! Come on! No, no. Please, Please... Bekka?! Shane! He's got to feed. No, don't, please!! Oh fuck! Fuck! I dunno what to... I dunno what to say. I love ya. I know. And if this is it and we're both about to die... I want you to know that I'm sorry... OK. I'm sorry for making this about me... And you're right, if you'd told me, I... I, never would have let you, cause I just so fucking love ya, OK, I'm so fuckin' sorry... Sorry... Leave us the FUCK alone! Shane??! No! Rebecca? Rebecca, it killed Shane! It killed... They weren't wanted in life, Sarah. They need a mother. I didn't want any of this. No... They wanted ME! I'm so sorry, this happened to you. No!! No, she is not your mother. It's not enough. It's not ENOUGH!
