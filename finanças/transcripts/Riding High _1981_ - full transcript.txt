Bad vibes at work? -It's all right. Well, I thought you liked riding, sweetheart! Only leads from one miserable job to another. But… It's only a temporary number, boy, just till you know what you really wanna do. There's only one thing I really like doing. Don't tell me. Stunt riding. Stunt riding? What can you do with stunt riding out here? -What is there here? -There's a few sheep. You're a sight more hip than the neighbours, let me tell you. [laughs] You silly old 'nana. You're on a right old downer, aren't you? Sorry. What you want, my dear lovey, is a nice cup of tea, couple of leapers and a rave up down the Mausoleum. They've got Fred Turkey doing the disco. [American accent] Okay, boys and girls, and welcome to this star-studded noche. Yes, I have a special delight for you. Would you believe, a new version of an old disco favourite? Yes-sirree-Bob, coming all the way from my dear old, good old friend, Franz Bernard, from the U.S. of A.! -[patron] Get on with it! -[DJ continues indistinctly] [Zoot Money playing "Your Feet's Too Big"] [indistinct DJ patter] ♪ You shine when it comes To swimmin' and duckin' ♪ ♪ But all thumbs When it comes to rockin' ♪ ♪ Your feet's too big! ♪ This is a real bloody treat, this is. Bloody Clerk spends an hour on the telephone begging me to come down here with him tonight, begging me! Telling me how much he loves me and adores me and all that bull. -And then I give into him because-- -Because you're so kind and generous. -And no one else has. -Correct! And what's he doing? He's in the bloody car park having multiple orgasms over his mates' motorbikes. Tonight, the Mausoleum presents an international collection of models designed at a reasonable price by that wonder man of mechanics, Mr. Dorking. First, the revamp of a 1927 classic, here gracefully paraded by Bawny Butler, the Doctor's Cooper in metallic cerise. Followed by Revenge. Betsy Bobbins comes to the wheel of this unassuming little number. Blue bottle exterior, velvet trim. Now, the gossamer delight of Dorking's own Deuce Coupe sports five windows and the palest blue flames set upon magnolia white. Sinister and sleazy. It's Nosferatu. An evil 32 Coupe only allowed out after dark. And from Brighton now, the Yellow Pill, a junky little Ford Popular with plenty of junks. Again, from across the water, the 1942 Sting, V8 air-cooled German commando car, driven by Fritz Levi Von Clatton. And finally, here he comes: Moody Munday, the self-appointed pretender to the stunt king's throne.

It's gotta be, uh… Hi. …charismatic, unique. -Gelt, make it a strain. -I'm straining! Make this one difficult, will you? Wait, I got it. That's it. That's it. The Tower of London. We need the Tower… No. [laughs] Buckingham Palace. That's it! Listen, you said you're well connected. Talk to Her Highness. Buck… What are you standing there for? Would you please get up and go? That's what you British need! You need our energy, you need American zap. I'll buy some. Shut up. Just shut up. Miss Mott. Good day to you. [Mott] I'm ready, Marvin.

Well… uh… what else do you have for me? Um… Some requests for the big jump competition. This many? This many? They're nuts. They'll all die. It's an impossible jump, you know. They'll all drop out in the preliminaries, I can guarantee it. Write the word "guarantee," Miss Mott. Write it in your book. Judas will be furious if this many apply, so that's what we're doing with them. Blame the Post Office, nobody will be surprised. But the hopes and aspirations of these young people. Gelt! Gelt! Gelt! Shut it. Just concentrate on the party, please. Look, try to get Windsor Castle. And tell the Queen I'm in a hurry, she'll understand-- -Gelt, what are you standing there for? -I'm kneeling. That guy spends more time in space than any other human. [woman] He's the greatest. Oh, yeah? One of his tracks nearly killed me. He's just flash. No one's mad enough to jump against him.

Dorking's talking. Right, number one. The theory, i.e. the mathematical calculations and the specifications of the ramp, the length of the jump, the velocity, the weight and impact of the machine, the weight of the rider, the fuel, et cetera, is all down to Astro and his sky-fi freaks. Correct. Exact. Affirmative. Technically true. Cosmically correct. Universally-- [Mr. Dorking] Over and out. Now, all other forms of transport are down to me and my mate in the territorials, and the less said about that, the better. Now, finances, such as they are, are down to Clerky, combined with all other administrations. Yes. Before leaving, everybody will donate a quid or more, but not less. And I will invest in various forms of illegal gambling. Right. Diet. Down to Burt Ganja. Brown rice and yoghurt for a month, my son. No more fry-ups? You don't fry yoghurt. Here! Do me a favour!

Affirmative. Well, it looks all right, don't it? -Bit shaky. -Must have a bit of elasticity. Elasticity? Put the 40-foot marker down. -That's a professional job, that is. -Is it? -In the trade… -[engine revving] In the trade, I would have won medals for that. Well… -I designed it myself and I built it. -19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27… -I'm very pleased with that. -This'll do. -All right! -All right.

He's had an accident? -Yeah, a bad one. He came off on landing. -A bad one? It looked terrible. He really hit the ground and the bike's on top of him. -He's blown it, it's bad. -Oh, dear. -Dear, dear, dear. -I don't know what to do. -Hit the ground hard? -Very hard indeed. -He did? -What are we gonna do? -He didn't get up, I suppose? -He couldn't move! -What do I do, Marvin? -He didn't? Oh, my God. [clicks tongue] Wonder what flowers we should get him. Perhaps a wreath. [chuckles] Marvin! If you'd seen it, it's not funny! It's not! -All right, all right, calm yourself. -How can I? -Not dead, is he? -I don't know. He's gonna be out of action for a long time, a long time, Marvin. -This changes a lot of things. -What are you gonna do? Thank you, Zoro. -Thanks. -Marvin. Marvin, hang on. Marv-- [sighs] Oh, Marvin. [footsteps approaching] -Marvin, the press handout. -Here you go, kid. "Shimmer Industry and I offer deepest sympathy for your tragic accident." "We hope that by giving you this gift, you can replace your sadly destroyed machine and vigorously strive to take up the challenge of the Judas S. Charriot show to be held in one week's time at the Devil's Leap, 2:30 sharp, tickets available from your local theatrical agent or call 01 785 2901." I, Marvin Ravensdorf, proudly bestow upon you the full cost of a brand-new motorcycle. -[photographer] Smile, please! -I was moving, can't you see that? -Now take it again. -[patient gasps] -Oh! Ta very much! -[Marvin] Would you please-- -What can I say? -[Marvin] What is this? -You're a knockout. -[Gran] Hello, dear. Wait a minute, I thought you were you. Silly me. -Five hundred quid? -Give it back. [Gran] Lay off the crispy lettuce. Give me that money. Give me that money. Refrain from taking pictures for one second. Look, give me that money back. It's mine. Give it to me! You tricked me. I thought you were you. You know you tricked me. It's mine! -Uh-uh. -Give me that money! Would you… Would you please restrain from taking photographs for one second? Thank you. Give me that money! Give me it! Give me that money, it's mine! Stop taking photographs! -Marvin. -Stop taking photographs! Give me that money, it's mine! -Give me that camera! -Come on, people! -I can't stand it! -Cool it. Cool it! I can't stand it! That was some recovery. Oh, somebody phone his shrink up, for Pete's sake. Who's the sufferer? Who suffers? I suffer. Every time, I'm the one that suffers! -Whose idea was this, Gelt? -It was yours, Marvin. Mine? Mine…? You think I'm gonna take the blame for this? You're nuts. It was your idea, Gelt, the whole thing. No, and neither Miss Mott nor myself could be held responsible for this fiasco. -How do you get out of this asylum? -You're a baby, Marvin. -You screwed it, you schmuck. -Me? Me? It was Zoro's idea. She's the one that told me that he was in the crash. How do you get out of here? Heads will roll, I'm telling you! Yeah, yours! Mine? I'm not taking the blame for this one, I'm telling you. Just think of the publicity. Oh! Clumsy! You should watch where you're going, a man of your age. Zoro said she saw him crash. She didn't see a crash. You know what she saw? She saw that Astro crash. Listen to me! Get your tush in the car, and you too. I've just given that totally healthy schmuck enough money to beat you into the ground, you drunken slob. -Who, me? -Now move it! Get in the car. I've had enough of this. And as for you, you can find your own way back, you groupie. That's all you are, a groupie. You think it's funny? You think it's real funny. You can just walk back as far as I'm concerned. Come on, move! -Well, the Hellcat's not showing. -What a wally, eh? [imitating chicken] Listen, creep, you jump what he jumped. She's after your body. Hey, this is for me and Judas. I don't want anyone else's nerves. I got enough of my own. [coughing] Morning. Hi, kid. It's magic time. Let's take a glance at our little bit of fun up here. I hope it's not far, I'm a bit out of training right now. [jet flying over] [dramatic music rising] [Judas sighs] Another first for British Rail. [chuckles] Screw that. No way is any promotional nut agent Shimmer Incorporated money-making machine gonna make me fly that little beauty. Oh, no, when I die, it's gonna be a different kind of suicide. I'm gonna stick a Champagne bottle in my mouth, release the cork and blow my eyeballs out. What happens to the jump? The competition? -You win, kid. -Eh? Far as I'm concerned, you've earned that machine. Listen, man, nobody's crazy enough to jump that ugly thing. Not even, and you should forgive the expression, the British. It's a joke, man. I ain't committing suicide. Anyway, I got two, no, three… three wives, and six… no, no, with Guss and the twins, that's nine kids to support, and various hangers on. And a whole lot of Champagne to consume. Shit, man, if I stopped drinking, France gonna go broke. Take a tip from the greatest in the world, kid. Don't do it. Nice socks. [Gran speaking indistinctly] He wins. The kid takes it. I am abdicating. -[Marvin] What? -The king is dead. -[Marvin] Abdicating? -Long live the king! [cheering and applause] Don't do that, I've got a bad heart. Forget it, baby, it's over. We've done it again! We did it, Mr. Dorking. You're not gonna get away with this one, baby. You think you can do this? He abdicates, thousands down the drain, Shimmer is seen as imperfect… My God, my eyes have gone numb. Are you taking me back to my pad? I like a full fleshed man, myself. [couples laughing] Mott! I said stop the fun. Now, my friends, I know, call me party pooper, but it's all here in this tiny thing called a contract. I know the print is small, very small, but it's explicit. Now, look, you, you can't welch on a deal with Shimmer Industry. We can back out, but you can't. I'll bury you in litigation. Crap. Do as you goddamn please. There's no way I'm taking a run at that little mother. -You listen to me-- -Like I told you, the kid wins. Come on, baby. Come back here! [snickers] You think it's funny, do you? Huh? Well, let me tell you something, toots. No jump, no bike, no money. No nothing, that's what you get. Look at the small print in your contract, you'll see what I can do to you. Listen! He gave up, I win. Kid… don't you know that Shimmer always wins? Where have you been? Now, I'm gonna do you a favour. He doesn't want to do the jump, I'm gonna let you do it. And if you don't want to, I'm gonna sue you and then make you do it. Right? Now, all I want to say is I want this show to go on! You know, you people give me nothing but bad vibes. [contemplative music playing] [motorbike approaching] I want out. I don't wanna do the jump. What you need is a little bit of distraction. You're still shaking. You'll be all right. Just hold on to me. Just take it easy and relax. I'm still shaking. [giggles] It's not the same kind of shake.

He's here with Zoro. You could open a shop up with all this. You don't need all this junk. Leave it, it's garbage. It's my stuff. Listen, you've got to make a choice. I want my things. Champagne and caviar, or Coke and chips? -[door thuds] -[Sky playing Bach toccata] [Judas] She stays. He goes. Come on, let's go. You've got to forgive her, kid. See, she's really two people. One, she's greedy, money-loving and avaricious. And two, she's greedy, money-loving and avaricious. -Sounds like Shimmer Industries to me. -What? What? How dare you say that! Shimmer operates at a highly moral business plateau, I'll have you know. In that case, we jump alone. None of that showbiz crap. It's him and me, to prove it. Man to man. -Man to boy. -Wait a minute. I don't know about this. We could film it. -Or video. -Of course. World rights. All right, I give in again. Have it your own way. It's a deal. Now lose this mother. [men shouting] -No violence! No violence! -Gotcha! [Zoro] Arnold! Arnold? Stop him. He'll blow Arnold to the press. Go on! Don't just stand there, Gelt! I'm gonna kill you. He spilled my drink. We've got him. [Judas] Come here, boy. Now we've got him! [Judas] Steady! [music fades] Ready! Well, at least we dressed casually. -[dogs barking, growling] -[Marvin gasps] What? Hello there, how are you? It's nice to see you. Hi! Mr. Ravensdorf. I'm sorry I couldn't get to Devil's Leap but I sprained my ankle, my auntie died, and I couldn't call you because the phone broke. -My pigeon escaped. -[woman coughs] Oh, and Beryl had flu. I were dead keen. Nothing would have kept me away. [Marvin] Don't worry about it. My only concern is for you, really. We was passing and I thought I would stop in because I've been working on the contracts. And I would hate to litigate. -Litigate? -Yeah, litigate. So, if this charming lady would be so kind as to let us into your charming house, we have a little business discussion to talk about. Won't take more than a minute of your time. Keep them on, there's germs everywhere. [dogs barking] [sighs awkwardly] Excuse me. [baby] Mummy! -Done? -Yeah. What do you think of our little joke, Dave? Eh? [contemplative music playing] [bird shrieks] [crows cawing] Hello, Mr. Ravingdorf! How nice to see you again. -Same to you, Granny. -How's Arnold keeping? I dig his coat. He's an implacable dresser. -I wonder why the blinds are drawn. -Dunno. Look out. Morning. Reckon I'll take a little look at Lovers' Leap, yes. Come along, my darling nightshade. There we are. [contemplative music playing] You can't win 'em all, kid. Now, if you want to chicken out in front of the cameras, that's okay by me. We'll call the whole thing off. Listen, I'm about to get on my bike. Why don't you get on yours? On your bike, Arnold! Gracious me, I do believe the child is being unpleasant. Amazing. Amazing. [disco music playing] Hi, guys. How are you? Working hard? Yeah… Hey, relax. Relax! Don't tell me you're nervous. All you have to do is jump the hole. And if you don't, don't worry about it. You won't remember a thing anyway. Come on, Granny, let's get this show on the road. -I'd just like to shake his hand first. -Just a minute. -To forget all the aggravation. -I know, but Judas is meditating. We should toss a coin to see who goes first. -Right. -Oi! What you got here, you bastard? Foreign muck. -A coin of the realm, if you don't mind. -I don't mind. Money's money, I'm not prejudiced. All right? Heads, he goes first. All right, Judas goes first. Now, let's move it. -Gelt, get the television boys moving. -Right. I've never seen a coin like this before. No. Good, innit? Two heads? Oh. Now, look, you. You've angered me, and when you anger me, you anger Shimmer Industry, and I have the power to hold you up in courts for the next 20 years. -Oh! -[glass shatters] Now, look, I'm gonna litigate and I'm gonna take you to court… What the heck's going on in there? -They're having an orgy in there! -[Marvin shouting, women laughing] What's that about? Dunno, could be testing the suspension. Know what I mean? -[Marvin] Get out there! -[Dave] It's a punch-up. Now, wait! -Let's get out of here. -He's ready. Come on, move it, Mott. You're gonna be all right, don't worry. -Hey, good luck, Judas. -[chuckles] He's concentrating. He doesn't like to be interrupted at this moment. -You know how it is. -No. [chuckles] [engine not starting] Come on. Come on. [chuckles] [engine revving] That's my man! Show 'em what we're made of, Judas! [Gran] Here, wait for me! -Come on. -[glass shatters] -What's that? -I dunno. Shouldn't be anybody else in there. [rock music playing] Hello! Get the cameras rolling! Judas is on his way right now! -Oh, God, come on. -[man imitating chicken] -Chicken! -He's aborted his mission. -Coward. -Big tart. Double crossed me. Said he would litigate, you see? [groans] Oh, hi, kid. How about a little libation? I think you better step outside first. Okay, kid. I had it coming. But this time, don't spill my drink. Careful, my dear sir, you're dealing with my life's blood. -You ready, Arnold? -Ready. [groans] Ow! Have you done it yet, kid? [chuckling] That's what I like to see. Hey, come on, guys, let's all be friends, huh? With you? You're joking. Don't say that to me, it's like a knife in my heart. Listen, I want to tell you something. None of this fiasco was my doing. I didn't know a thing about it. One man planned the whole thing. Who's that? -Gelt did it. -Oh! -You disgusting little man. -Shut up, Gelt! Shut up! -I resign. -I was there when you had the idea-- Mott, stop it! You see? You see the low karma I'm surrounded by? Now, listen, I wanna tell you something. Kid, you are the greatest stunt rider the world has ever seen, it's true. And you know what? I'm gonna make 'em know it. You want to be rich? I'll arrange it for you. All you have to do is sign here, and do it quick 'cause I'm gonna change my mind. As your advisor, David, I strongly advise against it. Take my advice, don't, Dave! Kid, you're smart. You know what you're doing. [chuckles] What's this? You signed your name "Bullshit"? -Is that the way you sign your name? -[laughing] Now you listen. Now I'm gonna do the jump for myself. No one else. -Good luck, David! -[encouraging banter] -Marvin. -What do you want? I'm depressed. -This just isn't your day, darling. -What? What! Let me go! Put me down! Put me down! -[motorbike revving] -Go!
