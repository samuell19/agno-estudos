Son of a bitch, they're gonna-- they're gonna kill me. There he is. I got him. Come on. Don't-- don't shoot. You're dead meat, fat boy. Come on, you son of a bitch, huh? We're getting close. Help me, somebody. Help me. Please, don't kill me. Please, don't kill me. Please, don't. Ple-- please. Please, don't kill me. Please, don't kill me. Don't kill me. Don't kill me! Please, please, don't do it. Please. No! He caught me off guard. It's not going to happen again. I know. Colonel Hogan, here are the recruits. My name's Hogan, commander of this outfit. You'll address me as Colonel Hogan, nothing else. Why do you want to be a part of this outfit? I like the money. What about you? The money. The same. And you? I'm here for the fun. What's your name, soldier? Cooper, Jack Cooper, sir. Now I don't know what you men heard about this organization. But if you think it's gonna be an easy score, you'd better walk out of here while you still can. Colonel Hogan-- Shut up! Now this ain't the Army. It ain't the Navy, and it ain't the Marine Corps. You'd better get that straight, 'cause I'm one hell of a lot meaner than any of them. Now I know you men are good. That's why you're here. But you're not good enough, not yet. If you want to be part of this outfit, you've got to be the very best at what you do. You prove that to me, you'll be the highest paid mercenaries anywhere. You don't, you'll die right here. I don't have any use for you. Your training will start in the morning. I suggest you get plenty of rest. You're going to need it. We don't play games here. When we train, it's for real. That's it. Get these men in uniform. Follow me. How did the exercise go? Not good, the runner took out one of our men. Damn it, we've got a bunch of damn Girl Scouts out there. We'll run the exercise again tomorrow. Take a couple of the men and go get another runner, a mean one. You got it. How about this guy? No, he's no good. Come on, Michael. It's time to get up. Michael, come on. It's almost 8 o'clock, and you're going to be late for work. All right, you asked for it. Now get up. Just for you. - You're too good to me. - I know. Hurry up. Your breakfast will get cold. Hurry up. This guy looks like he'd be a lot of fun. Yeah, he's the one. Hey, buddy, I was wondering if you could help me out. Yeah, what do you need? My buddy over here made a wrong turn someplace. We're looking for Main and Fourth Street. Uh, yeah, go straight down this road till you hit Main. Take a left. You should be at Fourth in about-- Hey, thanks a lot. What are you doing here, Michaelson? The question is, what the hell are you doing here, Hogan? We had an agreement. You pay the bills. I run the operation. That's the way it's gonna stay. I'm a businessman, Hogan, not a fool. It takes time to get the best from these men. I need at least three more months. Three months? I'll give you one, one month, at the end of which time, I want this operation ready for action. You got that? No way, it can't be done. I need more time. You're running out of time. I want this bunch of misfit mercenaries ready for action in one month, not one day more. Or I'll pull the plug on this whole operation, and you, too. Don't threaten me, Michaelson. You're supposed to be the best at what you do. Do it better. One month. - Run. - You're gonna die. What is it? The exercise is underway, Colonel. Good, maybe this one will last more than 10 minutes. Now I'm going to ask you some questions. And if you give me the right answers, I'm gonna let you live. Do you understand? Where are we? We're 70-- 75 miles southeast of Los Angeles. What the hell's going on here? Training, me-- mer-- mercenary training. What? The colonel don't believe in war games. He likes to use the real thing. Who is this colonel? What's his name? Hogan, Colonel Hogan. John Hogan? Yeah, I think so. How long has this been going on? How many people have died? I-- I don't know. Wrong answer. I don't know. I don't know, really. I just joined today. Bad timing. Colonel, they've got my weapons. Kill him. Daddy. Daddy, please, come as soon as you get this message. They-- someone took Michael. And I'm afraid that he's hurt. I don't know what to do, Daddy. Please, hurry. I need you. You two, fan out, left and right. Stay here. You're dead. Now tell me exactly what happened. Go ahead. OK, Mike went out to take out the trash this morning, and I heard a lot of noise. And so when I went to the window to see what happened, I saw this man hit him over the head with a pipe or something. And then they dragged him into the van, and it took off. You call the police? No, Daddy. I know you're retired, but I wanted to call you first. And the van, what kind of van? What color? Well, I don't know the make. But it was the kind of van without the windows, you know, like a delivery truck. Um, and it was green. Was it a light green, dark green? Dark green, but it was a funny kind of green, like army green. This is very important. Think hard. The license plate, the number, did you get it? I saw part of it. Well, any part. Uh, 2. 2. 4. 4. 7. 7, are you sure? 247? No. It was 427. 427? 427. Jaimy, are you positive? Mm-hmm. 427. Daddy, is that enough to bring Michael back? Well, we hope so, darling. I'll run it by the boys down at the station. I was on the force there for 30 years. I've got a little pull. I'll come up with something. Don't worry. Please, bring him back to me, Daddy. Well, I'd better get on it. I love you, Daddy. I love you, Jaimy. One more thing, very important-- when I leave here, keep all the doors and windows locked. Don't let anyone in until you hear from me. You got that? Yes. - Bye. - Be careful, Daddy. Colonel Hogan. - What do you want? - They're dead. They're all dead. What the hell are you talking about? The men, they're all dead. The runner killed them all. What? I don't believe it. It's true, every damn one of them. Get the men. We're moving out. This guy's a pro. Split up and move out. I want this son of a bitch dead. I know this. I know this style. It's my style. Danton? Mike Danton, it's got to be. Yeah, that was the name on the mailbox. Why? You know him? Know him? I trained him. Jack Cooper. Danton? Mike Danton? I'll be damned. I haven't seen you since the time you took a bullet trying to save my life. What the hell are you doing with these guys? Hell, I ain't never been good at pumping gas. Find another war, Jack. Christ. We're not hunting him. He's hunting us. Suck this. Come on. Now you're gonna die, tough boy. Any sign of him? Just bodies. It will be Sunset in an hour. He's trying to draw us deeper into the woods. He wants to catch us in there after dark. Let me go after him. You'll get your chance, Thornton. I don't want to lose any more men tonight. Let's move it out. Take as many men as you need and seal off a quarter-mile perimeter. We'll camp here for the night. Right. We can't just let him get away. He won't do that, not yet. He knows he's safe here. He'll take the time, rest, find some food. He'll be here in the morning. Sorry. You wondering what's going through his mind? No, I know what's going through his mind. I taught it to him. He went through our men like they were just toy soldiers. Compared to him, they're not even that good, not yet. That bastard was the best goddamn soldier I ever had under my command. I'd give anything to have 20 men just like him. Those bastards, those stupid, dumb bastards, I gave them 10 years of my life. I tried to show them how to create the most perfect killers ever. They wouldn't listen. They said I was crazy. Well, war is fucking crazy. But it worked. My methods worked. He's living proof that my methods worked. What do I get for it? Booted out of the Army, my walking papers, and a lousy $600-a-month pension, those stupid bastards. You created him. You trained Danton. You can do it with the rest of them. You're damn right I can, and I will. I will. What about Danton? What about him? What the hell are you gonna do with him? First, I want to talk to him. What? Then I'll kill the son of a bitch with my own two hands. Good. Get me another beer. Now! It's over, Hogan. Get your men out of here and crawl back into the hole you came out of. You're playing a game that you can't win. Don't try. Don't try, or I swear to God, I'll kill every one of you. You know I can. You made me the best. Well, I still am. I still am. Danton! Wake up, boy. Now hold on, boy. Don't go jumping up all half-cocked. Just lower that knife down real slow-like. I believe you better do as Will says. Now wait don't you get up and go before I get a mind to fill your behind full of birdshot? Go on. Git. Damn fool, running around in the woods with no clothes on. Will, that boy has been eating rats. Don't surprise me none. Them city folks will eat anything. Let's move it out. What the hell's going on here? Shut up. Was that your fire back there? Who the hell wants to know? Was that your fire back there? No, it wasn't ours. Where is he? Where is he? I ain't saying. Your turn. How far? About 10 minutes ago. Move out. End of story. Lieutenant, I want that man alive. Lieutenant. Danton. Danton! A colonel is talking to you, mister. Kiss my ass. Kiss this. Got women doing your fighting for you nowadays, huh, John? That doesn't sound like your style. Then again, she ain't much of a woman, though, is she? That's enough. Leave us alone. Hey, I'll see you again. Fuck you. I'll get right to the point. Yeah, why don't you do that? I want you to join me. You've got one damn strange way of showing it. That was an accident. They didn't know who they were grabbing. And I'm sure they didn't care. They were just following orders. How many, John? What? How many innocent people have you drug off the streets to kill playing your little games? Does it matter? It does to me. Get off it, Danton. You know as well as I do, you can't train fighting men without an enemy. You trained me. You were different. You were one in a thousand. There's a lot of money out there, Danton, a lot of would-be dictators, just willing to pay any price for my services, millions just waiting to be plucked. And you, you're worth 10 times more to me than any man I have, with the possible exception of Lieutenant Thornton, of course. What happened to you, Hogan? What really happened to you? How does a man go from being-- being the highest decorated officer in the special forces to becoming some goddamn, bloodsucking mercenary? That was their army. This one's mine, all mine. And I can write the price tag. Blood money. It's all green. Right. I trained you, Danton. You owe me. I paid my dues in the war. I owe you nothing. Join me, damn it. No way. I'm gonna give you a little time to rethink your situation, Danton, very little time. Hogan, I made you a promise last night. I'm going to keep it. You're gonna lose. I want to talk to you. I don't have time for this garbage now, Michaelson. You gave me one month. Come back then. You just sit down, shut up, and listen to me, mister. You've gone too far. It's out of control. I'll take care of it. Just get the hell out of here. You'll take care of it? How? When? I'll take care of it. I have the man here right now. You do that. Now I don't care if you crack a few heads and break a few bones. That's business. I understand that. But save the killing for overseas. I know what I'm doing here, Michaelson. I know it better than any man alive. Then you find a way to do it better, because I'm not sinking millions of dollars into an operation so you can go off on some personal vendetta and implicate me in murder and kidnapping. Don't be stupid, Hogan. If I go, the operation goes, and that's not my game plan. So take care of this Danton character and go back to business. Thirsty? Bitch. Danton! Assemble the men. Let's move it out. We're going after him. And this time, kill him. Freeze, asshole. Don't even think about it. Nice shot. Looked like you needed a little help. You cut my ropes back at the tent. Yeah, well, just don't let it get around, huh? You saved my life once in 'Nam. I figure this makes us even. I guess it does. Next time, it might have to be different. I know. Go on. Get the hell out of here. Damn him. I found his rifle laying up there, no sign of the son of a bitch. He's long gone by now. Somehow, I have to stop that man. We've got to get to him before he gets to the authorities. He won't do that. What makes you so sure? Why the hell should he? He doesn't need any damn help. He's killing all my men by himself. I know where he lives. Take care of it. Get back. Get back. What is this? Who are you? Who am I? A little man who spent 27 years of his life as a cop, trying to put big shots like you away, 27 years in the filth and the dirt of the street, and there ain't no music down there. You watch the people in the streets killing, raping each other, pumping dope through their veins while big men like you sit in the fancy penthouses. And yet the poor slobs rot in hell. I know about you, as long as it puts money in your pocket. Today, the nobodies who made you rich are gonna win. Die, you son of a bitch. So this is Mrs. Mike Danton. Well, well. Leave us. Your husband's caused me a great deal of trouble, Mrs. Danton, a great deal of trouble. He and I were once friends, good friends. But he's made me angry, very angry. And I'm afraid, Mrs. Danton, you're going to have to suffer the consequences of your husband's actions. He'll kill you. That may very well be. But right now, I'm going to hurt him worse than he could ever hurt me. Halt. Friend or enemy? I'm a friend. You're a liar. I got a present for ya. Who the hell are you? Daddy. Jaimy, what have they done to you? He raped me, Daddy. You son of a bitch. Get him the hell out of here. Where is she? Worried about your little wife? She better be alive. Maybe she is. I should kill you right now. Yeah, you should, but you won't, not if you want to see your pretty, little wife again. It's for you. Yeah. I got your woman here, Danton, real nice, little thing, and so soft. Hogan, if you hurt her, I swear to Go-- Shut up, Danton. What do you want, Hogan? You know what I want. I want you, dead. Here's the deal. I get you, and she goes free, not before. Let me talk to her. What's the matter, Danton? Don't you trust me? How do I know she's still alive? You don't. Now make a decision. You have three seconds. When and where? Sybil will bring you. And don't try anything stupid, Danton. Or I swear to God, I'll tear her fucking heart out with my own hands. Is that clear? Very. It'll be over soon, real soon. I'm gonna love watching you die. Fuck you. Looks to me like you're planting one hell of a surprise party. What do you want now, Cooper? I don't want anything. Have it. What now? You tell me. I came to help. Why? 'Cause I don't like what they're doing here. Besides you're probably gonna kill them all, anyway. I like being on the winning side. It's a lot healthier. Come on. Let's kick some ass. Any sign of him yet? No. Double the guard on Danton's wife. Tell them to stay alert. You got it. Freeze. Don't move. - Hey. - Cooper. What do you say, guys? How you doing? You got a light? Yeah. How's it going, buddy? Mike. Jaimy, baby, baby, look. I'm sorry, baby. In here, come on. Let's move it. Move it. Come on. We're gonna get out of here. Everything's gonna be OK. Come on. Here's a present for you, pal. Stay here. Danton. What the hell was that? It's my calling card. I want you to stay here until I come back for you. Do you understand? Don't move. Don't make a sound. No matter what you here, just stay here, OK? OK, please, come back to me. Split up. Jesus Christ. Come on. Come on. Somebody! Goddamn it! Move out. Move out. What about him? Fuck him. Move, move, move, move! Come on. Move out. Come on. Move out. Go. Come on. Move it. They've got us pinned down. Shut up. Move it. Move. Danton. Colonel, got a present for you. Now he's gonna die. Danton! Danton! I got your wife, Danton. It's all over. Come on out, or I'll blow her fucking brains out. Do you hear me, Danton? Danton. I'm gonna kill her, Danton. Danton, you got 10 seconds to show your face, Danton. Danton! Danton, she's gonna die. Danton, come on out, you bastard. Hogan! Don't do it, Cooper. I'll kill her, I swear to God. I don't think so. Go ahead and kill me, traitor. You fucked up. Get her! Bitch. No! That's what's left of your best man. Go ahead. Get it over with. Get up. Get up! Your shirt, take it off. What? Take off your shirt, before I cut you out from under it. Take off your shoes. Take off your shoes! Run. No. No, you can't do this. Run, now!
