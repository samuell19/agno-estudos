It's, like, nothing big, but, uh, anyways, this one day I was running errands, I kind of met this girl. # Ooh, the way she walk is like a crime. # Ooh, my mind is working overtime. # Ooh, can't help but fantasise, # cos she's got those kind of eyes. # Those eyes. # Uh, so... it was love at first sight. But not like love-love. No lovey-dovey, yeah, but, yeah. Yeah, I thought I wasn't gonna see her again. I thought it was gonna be one of those one-offs, eh. But I just had this- I just had this feeling that our paths will probably cross again. (CHUCKLES) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) So, yeah, we tried to make plans to catch up. (PHONE CHIMES) But, um, one of us would always be busy, cos, you know, our schedules are really different and, you know, we'd be like- we'd be, like, constantly missing each other. (PHONE CHIMES) So I changed up my schedule a little bit, you know, just moved stuff around and- to try and make time. But then she couldn't make it cos she's out hanging with her friends and- But, you know, I'm busy. You know, I'm busy as well. I'm- I'm busy hanging out with my friends. You know, everyone's got lives to live. So for a while it looked like it wasn't gonna happen. Might as well forget it. It's not worth it I mean, why bother going through all of that effort? # Feeling so fly inside. # I'm so fly. # Oh, but then out of nowhere (CHUCKLES) it all just worked out. Oh, but then out of nowhere (CHUCKLES) it all just worked out. - Well, we managed to catch up, and I- you know, I finally got to know more about her, so-- so, yeah, I made sure I really listened to her. You know, girls really like it when guys listen to them. - WOMAN: That skux guy from med school, he was very friendly. - (PEOPLE CHATTER) Uh, he's a bit... plastic. Not my type. And your type is...? Um, an island guy? - (FRIENDS LAUGH) - What? What was that? - An island guy. - Really? Yeah, like a real island guy, like the kind that has it together here. You know, works the land like back in the islands. What, were these guys not fresh enough for you? Yeah, so this girl, she wants a real island guy, not someone plastic. (BIRDS CHIRP) (GRUNTS) - Hey, Dad. - O le a? Dad, do you-? Do you think I'm plastic? No. You're not plastic. You know, plastic's good to keep your food fresh. Plastic's very useful in my life. You're not a plastic. (STARTS LAWNMOWER) I really like this girl, but, you know, I just didn't think I was her type. Adam, I have a photo on the phone. How do you put it on the Facebook? But you know what they say - when one door closes, a window will open, so, I don't know, something like that. Here, go on. And all your dad's family - unfriended all of them. - Don't let me see their stupid faces. - OK. (QUIRKY MUSIC) Who's this guy? That's your cousin Tavita, Auntie Palepa's son. - And this guy? - That's Mose, Auntie Fa'aleo and Uncle Leui's son. I realise if I'm going to become the guy this girl will like, then I'll have to see my cousins in Samoa. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Oh wow. That story was, uh... amazing.

What do you want to go for the bush for? All you do is sit and wipe your bum with a cushion on the couch, with the PlayStation, playing with yourself all day. When I was in the island, I didn't have anything. Yeah, yeah, they're fine with me coming here. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (TENSE MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) I'm going to find Mose and Tavita. Be careful.

(QUIRKY MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Oh my God. Really? (TENSE MUSIC) - You owe me one, Mose. - This is gonna be the last try, I promise. Adam, look, this is for real real. Cuz, all you had to do is just make a sound from your voice. Just a little bit sound. (TENSE MUSIC) (MUSIC SWELLS) Hey, Adam. (MUSIC CONTINUES) (MUSIC FADES) Cuz, what happened? - Nothing. - Nothing? Yeah, I saw you do nothing but supposed to be something. Oh, well, I don't know. It's not my fault. (TENSE PIANO MUSIC) (TENSE PIANO MUSIC) Cuz, why are you here? It's OK. Goodnight, Adam.

Let's go put the umu down. - What time is it? - It's 5am. Oh, man, come on. Get up. You wanna be an island guy or what? - (GROANS) - Get up. Let's go. (INSECTS CHIRP) - I need all of them, Adam. - The whole thing? Yeah. You know what you're gonna do? - Peel these bananas. - Peel the- All of them? - Yeah. Pull it out from there, then you start it from the beginning. Come right up the top. (CONTINUES SCRAPING) Adam, Adam. - Adam, wake up. - Shh. Just leave him. Can't you see he's useless? (SCRAPING) {BIRDS CHIRP, BELL RINGS THREE TIMES) (BIRDS CHIRP) WHISPERS: Go change and come back. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) C-Can I do something? Can I help? Hey.

(FUNKY MUSIC) (FUNKY MUSIC) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (WOMAN LAUGHS) - So, that's Adam. - Oh. OK, Adam, go do your thing. Uh, no. She's with her friends. I'll just wait till she's alone. Oh man, that's what a stalker would say. - Doesn't matter. Just go. - (SIGHS) All right. OK. Yeah, OK.

(CHUCKLES) - Yeah. - I did it. - That was really good. Man, are you serious? After everything we have told you, that's all you can do? Man, that was... That was useless. And you, you are useless. (TENSE MUSIC) (SIGHS) You will never get that girl, ever. (SOMBRE MUSIC) (MUSIC CONTINUES) (SIGHS) What? I get in at 5am. Well, what about Dad? Fine, I'll just walk. I'll be going home. Not even a thank you? This- This was stupid. You know, I should have never come here. Do you actually think that coconut oil makes girls notice you? Coconut oil is a high-vis vest for your face. Everything you do is backwards. I was stupid to think that my cousins who live in the bush could actually help me. Excuse me. We're not from the bush. We live in a fale. Yeah, with your stupid ideas and your broken English. Sorry you feel that way, cuz. Nah, you're not helping him. I can tell by the look on your face that I really hurt you. But you can tell by the look on my face that I don't even care. Ia faasao lou olaga ua kele lava lou fiapoko. I will straighten the path that your life is heading to. - First and foremost, you are so ungrateful. - Mose, you don't have to. No, wait, did you really think this girl would like you just by coming here, learn all those stuffs? Man, you are so arrogant. You are so blind. Why do you think this girl wanna go out with an island guy? Huh? Maybe you understand a little bit more if you had talked to her. If you fa'alogo with your... stalker ears. Now, I'm right, huh? That's exactly what this girl wants - a real man, not just an island guy, a guy who knows how to be a man. And you know what? You are not that guy. How can you protect a woman, respect her the way she deserves if you don't know how to respect your own parents? And I can see it now, and so is Tavita. How did you afford to come here when you've got no job? How? Huh? How come you have a flash phone and your laptop that you do your Facebook stalking, huh? Somebody must have bought it for you. Who? Your mum and your dad. And you just walk up here expecting us to teach you to become this 'real island guy', and you don't even know how to say please. - Gotta have manners, know how to say please and thank you. - Oh, come on, Tavita. You assume other people will change their life for you? We've been taking our time off our life just to help you because that's what family does. Do you even help your parents? You don't know how to cook. You don't do the washing. You don't even pay rent. You think you're shy and humble, but you're not. You're just afraid to talk to girls because once they get to know you, they figure that out that you are not good enough for them. And the only thing to hide the truth is for you not to say anything. And that's your defence mechanism. You think your cousin from the bush doesn't understand psychiatrics? - Psychology. - Psychology. You got it easy. You got opportunity, but what have you done with it? Nothing. I Know your parents raised you proper, but you just took advantage of them. Cuz, you're not as innocent as you think you are.

Uh, I guess that's something we can work on. Um, also, do you have anything else other than what you're wearing? Cos, um, it looks like you've just come back from hunting. (PIG SQUEALS) (INSPIRING MUSIC) - Adam. - Oh. Thought I'd cook you some breakfast before you go to work. Sole. - Are you taking drugs? - (CHUCKLES) I-- I'm going to look for a job today as well. I went yesterday, but the person at the place said that my, uh, CV was... - ...useless? - Shh. - Yeah. - Does your CV have a picture of PlayStation on it? No. What? Uh, I just need more experience. (INSPIRING MUSIC CONTINUES) (MUSIC SWELLS) (MUSIC SWELLS) (MUSIC QUICKENS) (MUSIC SLOWS) (MUSIC SWELLS) Bye, PlayStation.

(MUSIC CONTINUES) I'll give you that. - (SIGHS) - Thank you for everything you are doing. We are very happy with the help you have given us. But your mum and I, we don't want you to keep working like this. We want you to have a better life, better than what we have. Son. You want me to go and study something? Get a good education and then a good job. So when you give Mum and I the envelope, it will be a bigger envelope. - (CHUCKLES) - A heavy envelope. If you want it heavy, I can put coins in it for you. - Oh yeah, so I can throw the envelope at your head, huh? {LAUGHS) It's up to you, son. Do whatever what you want to do. Yeah. You're right. Thank you. I just have a few things I need to take care of first. Yeah. You're right. Thank you. I just have a few things I need to take care of first.

Well, um, I just wanna say, uh, thank you for everything that you guys did for me and for everything you guys taught me. I also wanna say that I'm sorry. You guys were right. - I was selfish, and I was pretty useless. - Mm, yep. Huh. Everything you guys told me was true, so I just- just wanna say that I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, no, cuz. You know love for the family is forgiveness. No, I- I actually owe you guys one. Anyways, um, I brought you guys something. (CHUCKLES) Here. (CHUCKLES) - Oh. I always wanted a blue T-shirt like this one. - (CHUCKLES) Is this what I think it is? (GIGGLES) Oh! (LAUGHS) - (CHUCKLES) - I always wanted a phone like this one. And now I have a phone like this one. (LAUGHS) Mm. So, your parents paid for all of this? I- I paid for it myself this time. (CHUCKLES) I got a job, actually. A couple of jobs. Uh... I've also been helping out at home. - Um, I'll be going to study when I get back as well. (CHUCKLES) - (ROOSTER CROWS) Well, that's good. Yeah, that's really good, cuz. Oh wow. Thank you, cuz.
