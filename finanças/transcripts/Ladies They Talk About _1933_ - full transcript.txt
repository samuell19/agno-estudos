Police, police! Hurry, please! A man's running wild here with a butcher knife stabbing people. West Side. La Paloma Street. Hurry, please! Okay. 'Police Department calling car 47. Car four seven.' 'Go to the corner of 8th and Adams. Auto accident.' 'That is all.' 'Police Department, calling all cars.' 'Calling all cars.' 'Go to the West Side, vicinity of La Paloma Street.' 'Mad man running amuck with a butcher knife.' 'Calling all cars. Go to the West Side.' 'Man running amuck with butcher knife.' Get going, Mike. Gotta wait about a half hour. Oh, I can't wait. I have to catch a train at 10 o'clock. Are you gonna put money in or take it out? Put some in to cover checks I wrote for train tickets. - Oh, I don't know. - Oh, please. All right. Come on. Thank you. Now you hold Fifi for me. And you must show me how to make out one of those deposit slips. Swell! She made it. My maid usually does all my banking for me. - Get one of those slips, lady. - These? Yes. No, no, lady, that's for the date. - You fill in the amount there. - Oh! Alright everybody! Stick 'em up! 'Come on, sister, get out of there. Don't move!' - Ah! - 'Don't move!' 'Keep your hands up.' Come on, stick 'em up, officer. You too, sister. Okay, Dutch. Get going. Never mind the chicken feed. Give me that gatt! Now the first one that sets off an alarm. I'll blow your insides all over the wall. Come on, Dutch, we're blowin'. Everybody stand still. Don't move, see? If you want to live to talk. Call the cops! Don't stand there. Call the police! - Hello! - Give me the Police Station. Yes, hurry it up. - Call up somebody. - Oh, my goodness. I feel so dizzy. What happened? - Police! Police! - Somebody get the police! It's almost 10:00. I must hurry or I'll miss my train. I'm sorry, madam, but you can't go till the police come. But surely you have enough witnesses. You'll ruin my trip. It can't be helped. Them's the rules. Say, let me talk! Where were you when they pushed in? I was helping a lady with a deposit slip. I was holding her dog. I had only let her in a few minutes before. Let's have a look at this lady. Where is she? There she is, there. 'Why, that's Mrs. Andrews. One of our depositors.' Oh, I see. What do you know about this holdup, Mrs. Andrews? Nothing, except I'm taking my money out of here. Apparently it isn't safe. What did you say your name was? The manager told you, didn't he? Do you usually do your banking before banking hours? My maid usually does my banking. Why didn't she do it this morning? Because I let her go. I was going on a trip. I came here to deposit money to cover checks I had written for my train tickets. And where are the tickets? Here. And here's the money. You're through asking stupid questions, I'll go. Not yet. You're going to take another train, lady. Didn't I used to know you before you became Mrs. Andrews? I don't think so. And before you turned platinum? Not so hot as a blonde, Nan, not so hot. Come on, I want to have a little talk with you. For a dumb dick you have a memory like an elephant. I have been much criticized of late by certain politicians and their newspaper backers as being a meddler in the affairs of this city. I have never meddled in the private affairs of anybody. But I have meddled and intend to continue meddling in politics. Especially when crooked politicians are stealing the taxpayers' money by being lenient with criminals. Or are escaping punishment through incompetent prosecutors and corrupt judges. That there is need of my meddling is shown by the wave of crime that is raging unchecked in this city. This very morning.. Three armed bandits entirely scorned by the police walked calmly into a bank and helped themselves to money that you, and you, and you.. Have toiled and sweated to save. 'What has the district attorney done about this holdup?' 'Or the seven other bank robberies we've had' 'in the last four weeks?' 'Nothing.' 'He's been too busy telling the newspapers' 'what a great man he is.' I had a hunch Slade'd toss a few harpoons into me tonight. What do you care what he says about you? There are a lot of people in this town who listen to him. They have radios and they have votes. In eight consecutive bank robberies we've had only one arrest. A girl. The district attorney is a fine fellow personally. But as a prosecuting official he needs me and my meddling lots more than I need his personal friendship. So I am going to continue to meddle, and meddle, and meddle. Until something definite is done. If David Slade was District Attorney he'd do something. - I wish he was my son. - I wish he was my boyfriend. Come in, Miss Taylor. Shall I sit down or do they confess easier standing up? Miss Taylor, this is David Slade 'our perennial and persistent reformer.' 'He's a bit of a nuisance in this town but he's regular.' He wants to have a little talk with you. 'I saw your picture in the paper this morning.' 'It interested me.' Don't I know you from somewhere? Up in Benicia, wasn't it? I must have a swell pan. Everybody's remembering me these days. But your name wasn't Taylor then. It isn't now. I'm Mrs. Andrews. It was Ellis. Nan Ellis. I remember you distinctly now. Your father was a deacon in the church up there. And you were little Davy Slade. And your father was the town drunkard. Well, Brother Slade, things change, don't they? The deacon's daughter in jail and the bad boy of Benicia hymn-shouting reforms. She got your number, Dave. No, Nan, I'm no hymn shouter. Just a right guy trying to persuade others to go right. But what's happened to you? I felt bad when I heard you'd been sent to Reform School. - You were such a sweet kid. - Yeah? Well, too much deaconing took all the sweetness out of me. It often does. - How did you ever get in this? - Ask him. So, you've got a reform school jilt in your pedigree, eh? Didn't they teach you your lesson up there? They did, but it didn't take. I'm not any too happy, Nan, seeing you here like this. I'm not exactly crazy about it myself. But they've gotta pin it on somebody. And I haven't very many friends. I'll take care of that, if you're actually innocent. I've been straight ever since I got out of reform school. Won't you believe me, David? I'd like to. - If only for old times. - They won't let me go straight. That's why I wore that platinum wig and changed my name so they wouldn't know me. Oh, I can't go straight if they won't give me a chance. I don't know whether Nan Taylor is guilty or innocent. And neither do the police. But I do know that she has her rights. And the authorities are wrong to keep her in jail without positive evidence one way or another. Pretty tough being D.A., isn't it? Yes, but not so tough that I want to lose the job in next month's election. Slade isn't doing you any good. And that radio station of his is plenty powerful. Yes, I know. However I think he and I will be able to get together. I want to be re-elected.. And he wants a favor. Nan Taylor. 'District Attorney wants to speak to you.' Well, now, isn't that just too sweet? District Attorney? The Mayor'll be dropping in to see her next. The Governor's flying down to take her out to tea. President Hoover called her up last night. Yes, but she had a date with Mr. Roosevelt. 'Doesn't that dame make you sick?' 'What she needs is a good sock at the jaw.' Why the bag, Taylor? I've got a strange hunch I'm on my way. - So long, Spanish. - Adios. Goodbye, Twisty, see you in Paris. This is Miss Taylor. Please go right in, Ms. Taylor, the District Attorney's waiting. Oh, that's alright, Mr. Simpson, don't bother getting up. Oh, pardon me, Ms. Taylor. Won't you be seated? Thank you. 'I'm just okaying the architect's plan' for enlarging the woman's ward in the County Jail. - 'Charming idea.' - Yes, isn't it? You're wasting that panorama on me, Nan. Save it for David Slade. Nan, you and I talk the same language. Now, I'm absolutely convinced that you were the front for that bank holdup. We can't prove it yet. But if I find you guilty, which I believe you are I'll see that you get yours. Meanwhile, Dave Slade's interested in you. 'He's a powerful man in this town' 'and he wants me to set you loose.' I'm going to take a chance and parole you to him. They're drawing up the release papers out there now. Oh, Mr. Simpson, you don't know what this means to me this chance to prove I'm straight. Stop kidding and be yourself. I've known Dave Slade around this town for the last ten years. 'And you're the first skirt I ever saw him go for.' - What do you mean, go for? - Just what I said. I've seen him deal with a thousand women. And this is the first he's ever gone overboard for one of them. 'He's fallen for you and he's fallen hard.' He shot straight with you, Nan, and if you've got it in you you'll shoot straight with him. 'He still thinks of you as the sweet, innocent little girl' 'he knew in Benicia a long time ago.' 'Live up to it, Nan.' - 'Mr. Slade is here.' - Show him in. Come right in, Dave. Hello, Walter. Hello, Nan I'll see if those papers are ready. I suppose the District Attorney has told you. Yes, and it's wonderful. I don't mean just getting out of jail. You have faith in me and you've gone to all this trouble because you believe in me. Of course I have faith in you, Nan. I-I don't suppose I should have done that. Alright. I guess it was just something neither one of us could help. I'll take you home 'til you find something suitable for you. Maybe you could help me in my work. - Your own home? - Yes. You remember my older sister Stella from up in Benicia. She keeps house for me. Benicia. Gee, that sounds a long way off. We've both walked down funny roads since then, haven't we? None of us has come through life altogether clean. I found, it's wise to let bygones be bygones. 'Let the past take care of the past.' That's sweet of you. What you've just said gives me courage to tell you something you should know before we go any further. Up to now I haven't been on the level with you. You were trying to get me off and you were a powerful man I played up to you. Some of the things I said during your visits to jail I meant. But most of them weren't on the level. Yes? I was in on that bank stick-up. I was everything the District Attorney said. I.. What's the matter? But Dave, what difference does it make? You yourself said just a moment ago to let bygones be bygones and that we're starting a new future together. This is different. I don't know what to say. Here they are, all ready to sign. And you can be on your way. Here you are, Dave. What's the matter, what's happened? - I'm sorry, Walter. - What do you mean? Oh, I just told him something. Something he didn't know. - Yeah? - Yeah. Before he can rat on me, I'll beat him to it. I was in on that bank stick-up. Who were your companions, Nan? I didn't get their names. Send in the matron. - You're going on a little trip. - I'm all packed. Scram. - No me quito. - Is that so? Now listen, sister. I've got a season's ticket for this chair and it's got three years to go. - So supposing you get up? - No me quito. - Come on, now. - No me quito! I don't want to hurt you now. Whatever you do, you'll clean it up yourself. - Had a bath? - Yes. Give her a dress. Here's a neat little model. Ought to fit you. - Can't I have a new one? - Ask Ms. Johnson, there. - She's head matron. - How about it? Maybe, after you've been here a few years. Now, get into the dance. Get in there and get that on. Gee, I thought the County Jail was tough. This is a penitentiary, not a pink tea. You're telling me? New fish! New fish! Well? Make yourself at home. 'And now, ladies and gentlemen, as is usual at this hour' 'we have the pleasure of presenting David Slade' 'who will discuss tonight' 'the recent failure of the City Power Trust.' Hey, you can't do that sort of thing around here. Just a minute, girls. We've a rule, you've to ask permission to touch the radio. There'd be a riot if we let every girl change the thing every time she didn't like the tenor. There'll be a riot if anybody turns on that thing again. Your personal likes and dislikes don't matter much up here. Say, Newman, you gonna let this new fish get away with that? I've got permission to listen to Brother Slade any time I want. If there's gonna be trouble about the radio there isn't gonna be any radio. Listen.. Don't think you can walk in here and take over this joint. There's a lotta big sharks in here that live on fresh fish. Yeah? And when they add you up, what do you spell? That goes for all of you. 'Just another dame trying to show how brave she is.' If I hear his voice on the radio again I'll kick the tubes out. I know, you're afraid to listen to him. You're afraid he'll make you decent. Listen, sister. I heard him in the witness box at my trial when the judge said "I sentence the defendant Nan to a term of two to five years." Oh, so you're Nan Taylor. The beautiful bank bandit. You're the one that nearly hooked him into that parole and tried to make him fall for you. Say, there isn't any punishment bad enough for you. Yeah, well, being pinned up here with a daffodil like you comes awful close. - Got a lotta nerve, haven't ya? - So what? I think it's swell. It'll take plenty to get by with in here. I've gone around with almost everything but it was baby's milk compared to coming through that gate with all these dames staring at you. Alright, honey. Well, I've been here two years and I wouldn't have the nerve to do what you did. Maybe you won't either, after a while. I'll take care of myself. All I want is a fifty-fifty break. You won't get that. But there's a lot of things that won't hurt you to learn. You can take them from me or learn them as you go along. I'll take them from you. Swell. Linda's the name. Come on, I'll show you around. This is the greenhouse. Hello, Burbank, how's crops? Hello, Linda. And here we find the dining rooms. - Connected with the morgue. - Is the food that bad? Well, it's cooked by three dames up here for poisoning. - What do they use on you? - Beans mostly. This is Tuesday, we get jute balls for dinner. Jute balls? When they grow up they turn into a burlap sack. Hello, kids. This is the sun yard. You'll have a nickname for every grass blade before you get out. When can I see my cell? Room, my dear. Don't be vulgar. Mine looks like a chorus girl's delight. Can you fix them up any way you want? Sure. Anything but build yourself an exit to the street. Swell, isn't it? Yeah, except that I don't like to be teased. How come? Out here within a few feet are the two things you want most. But you're always a few feet away. Freedom... and men. - This is the lady's bird club. - Lady's bird club? Membership limited strictly to stool pigeons. They talk their way in here and try to squeal their way out. I know how to treat them. You better be careful of Sister Suzy. The one you had the argument with. She's a dope on anything fanatic. Sounds like she had a crush on Brother Slade. Yeah, and that kind of crush is ten times as deadly in here as outside. Shut up so long those dames go daffy. She'll make it tough for you. I'll watch her. - Hi, Noonan. - Hello. She's second matron. Okay if you are but don't cross her. - Her name's Noonan. - I get it. Who's the society dowager with the glass eye and the lap dog? That's the Mrs. Arlington. Of the Westchester Arlingtons. Is that why she's here? Dear Mrs. Arlington was a little jealous of a certain Mrs. Banks. So she gave a dinner in Mrs. Banks honor and ground up some of her finest glassware in Mrs. Banks' caviar. Oh, dear. Uh-oh! Never mind, Duchess. Just a new fish. Hiya, Blondie. Blondie, Nan Taylor. - Pleased to meet you, honey. - How do you do? This little cream puff met a guy at a dinner one night and wanted to know his name. 'So she shot him and read it in the morning paper.' Hey, cut it! Come on, I'll introduce you to Aunt Maggie. She's a grand old soul. Aunt Maggie, this is the new fish, Nan Taylor. How do you do? Hello, Nan, how are you? I watch over the girls up here. Sort of makes me feel at home. Aunt Maggie's up here for running what she called a beauty parlor. Yes, and I did pretty good at it, too. Until a detective sergeant came to my place. Came to my place to get a manicure from one of my girls. - Smoke, Nan? - Can you? Sure, in the washroom. I was just telling her about that detective that came into my place for a manicure. Got a match? - Hello, Carrie. - Hello. - Meet Nan Taylor, new fish. - Pleased to meet you. Cigarette? No, thanks. I'm doing my lesson. I've got to hurry. Can you beat that? Always in a hurry and up here for life. The plumbers must been having their annual picnic in here. Why? 'Look at that.' Watch out for her. She likes to wrestle. Mm-hmm. I'm sorry, Mr. Slade but Miss Taylor still refuses to see you. If she'd only believe that I really do want to help her. Both Miss Noonan and I told her you were here. We talked with her but.. I know. She won't even answer my letters. Well, I suppose all I can do is keep on trying. - I'm sorry. - Thank you for your kindness. - Good afternoon, Miss Johnson. - Good afternoon, Mr. Slade. ♪ If I could be with you one hour tonight ♪ ♪ If I were free to do ♪ ♪ The things I might ♪ ♪ I want you to know that I wouldn't go ♪ ♪ Until I told you honey ♪ ♪ I love you so ♪ ♪ If I could be with you ♪ ♪ I'd love you strong if I could be with you ♪ ♪ I'd love you long ♪ ♪ I'm telling you true ♪ ♪ I'd be anything but blue ♪ ♪ If I could be with you ♪ ♪ One hour tonight ♪ ♪ If I were free to do the things I might ♪ ♪ I want you to know that I wouldn't go ♪ ♪ Until I told you honey ♪ ♪ I love you so if I could be with you ♪ ♪ I'd love you strong if I could be with you ♪ ♪ I'd love you long ♪ ♪ I'm telling you true ♪ ♪ I'd be anything but blue ♪ ♪ If I could be ♪ ♪ With you ♪ - Oh, gee, that was swell. - Come on, sing another one. Just one more, please, come on. Aunt Maggie, you have such a terrible permanent. I can't do a thing with it. There's a canary bird somewhere if you could always find it. Oh, it's mommy's precious little girl and doesn't want her mommy to make her beautiful and take her out. Well, that's exactly what we're gonna do with our little baby. You're just always exercising.. What's your hurry? You ain't going any place. Who said she isn't? - Oh, pardon me. - Hello, Genevieve. - See that dame? - Yeah. She used to be one of my girls. She quit. The stairs were too much for her. Oh, Aunt Maggie! Mail, girls. Come and get it. - Susie. - Yeah. - Blondie. - Yes. - Mustard. - Yeah. I'm going to smoke. Wanna go have one? Not now, honey. My husband's just coming up the stairs. It's a 100 foot drop off the window. Nothing new in that. It's happened plenty of times. You're telling me. That's why I'm here. Oh! Thanks. Jo Jo. Jessie Jones. - Nan Taylor. - Yeah. 'Here's your mail.' Oh, keep it. You know I never read that monkey's letters. I know. But there's a different one for you this week. Probably an old gas bill. - Anais Gorme. - Thank you. You finally read one of Brother Slade's letters after all. Wrong again, sister. I passed up my weekly laugh once more. You cut his picture out of the paper. Stuck it on the wall. Sure. I was beginning to forget his pan. I wanted to remember to keep on laughing. You laugh at him, pretend to hate him. But you don't. You love him. Stop. You're killing me. All the time he comes here, trying to help you. What do you mean? He always tries to help everybody. Well, I might see him after all. I can't understand why he keeps coming to see you. How he can stoop so low. It's a mystery to me too. If he can help me out, or shorten my sentence I've been a sucker not to see him. Well, you aren't gonna see him. Now or ever. No? Don't make me laugh. Don't let her get you down, Susie. I'll fix her. Plenty. Mustard, come here at once. I'm speaking to you for the last time. Well, I hope so. Where is my laundry? I told you several days ago to bring it to my room. I ain't gonna bring it until you pays me what you promised. I told you, Mustard those things didn't come with my last order. Hmm. You means you never ordered them. I promised to wash your drawers if you'd give me some bleach, cream and hair-straightener. Until I get some, you don't get no drawers. - Even if you's freezin' your... - Mustard! How dare you talk to me that way? You forget who I am. Oh, no. I knows who you am and what you am. Yous just an old.. Listen. You're discharged. I'm going to have you punished. Miss Johnson. - Call her. Go ahead, call her. - Miss Johnson? Go ahead and call her. I ain't afraid of nobody in this jail. I's doing life, and that's all I got. How dare you talk to me that way! How's that.. Go back to the laundry. Did you hear me? Noonan. The parrot. Yes, ma'am. I's going. Alright, girls. Go back to your places. It's all over. I don't suppose there's any place where one doesn't have trouble with the servants. It's swell to see you, Lefty. I'd come up sooner, Kid. Only I couldn't take the chance. Sure was a tough break about the boys, eh? I don't get you. Don, and Dutch. - Didn't you get the news? - No. What happened? They was picked on suspicion and a couple of chumps identified them on an old rap. They're on the other side of the wall, doing a 20 to life. Oh, gee. The poor kids. That's terrible. That's one reason I'm up here now. The boys figure they can crash out if you help. How can I help? I'm in here myself. Ain't I? Don wants you to map the women's section showing your cell. They've a plan to tunnel through and come up in your coop. You can cover them while they're digging. A victrola and some jazz records will do the trick. What's the idea of crashing in the women's section? They're not out when they're in. There's a lot less artillery, and not so many guards. If you can get me the map and a design of the matron's key to the main corridor. Have 'em ready when I come next month. The rest will be a joke. The boys figured everything else, perfect. Gee, you can count on me, Lefty. I'll do anything for Don, and Dutch too. Then the job's good as done. I'll tell the boys to start digging soon as I get the map. I maybe out of here myself before long. What do you mean, out? Your parole ain't due for eight or nine months. Yeah, I might be able to use that Slade sap in some way. You didn't have luck with him earlier. I'll handle him different next time. You better. - Well, I gotta breeze. - So long, Lefty. So long, kid. Take care of yourself. Nan, get going. I wants that spot for my boyfriend. Okay, Mustard. Mustard, my own sweet, little Mustard. Don't give me none of that, Orwell. What I wants to know is, has you been true to me or not. 'Course I have, honey. You know that. Mustard! - Well. - Here's the map. I'll have a drawing of the key soon. It takes lot of figuring. I'll slip this to Don on my next visit. Psst! Dutch! Okay. Hello, Nan. You busy? No. Come on in. Thought I'd chin a few minutes before locking up for the night. It's swell the way you visit us girls. Well, you get to know the girls. It makes things easier. - You're Irish, aren't you, Nan? - Half. - And the other half? - Irish. That's great. It's a compliment, coming from you. That's a compliment coming from anybody. I've been here a long time. You've come through it better than others. I knew it'd be a tough fight. I've never let anything lick me yet. And I never will. The Irish are great fighters, Nan.. And lovers. I doubt, as far as I'm concerned. You did love him. You still do. After what he pulled? He was living up to his code. As you'd live up to yours. Why not give him a break? He's coming up next visiting day. I'm glad. Well, I'll be locking up now. Noonan, don't those keys ever get you down? I've wrestled with them too long. There's twelve of them. I've named them after the Apostles. This is St. Peter. The key to the big gate. This is St. John. The master key to all the cells. - That's a big one, isn't it? - Sure. - Yeah. - 'This is St. Luke.' - Key to the matron's office. - Yeah. And this is St. Vitus. You know that one. Hello, Aunt Maggie. Making yourself beautiful? Uh-huh. - Is this her coat? - Yeah. Whose coat is this? - Mine. Why? - Your coat, eh? Is this your love note, too? No. I found it in your pocket. Somebody must have put it there, eh? - Yeah. - I expected you'd say that. You're not disappointed. I know who did it. Who? I'm no stool pigeon. Alright. 30 days in the laundry for you with no privileges. No picture shows, no books, no letters, no visitors. - But Miss Johnson... - No buts about it. - You know the rules. - That's a dirty trick. - Shut up. - She didn't pull that. Alright, if you feel badly about it, the same goes for you, too. Gee, that's tough, Nan. Means you can't see that Slade guy next Wednesday. You're telling me. Hello, Sister Susie. Hello, Nan. Well, they took away all my privileges. But there's one privilege they can't take away from me you dirty little sneak. Why, you.. 'Scram! The Matron!' What's the matter here? What's happened? The poor, little dear stumbled and fell. Quiet, girls. Quiet! I'm sorry. But rules are rules. We'd like to help you, Mr. Slade. But we must enforce our regulations. But Nan wrote that she wanted to see me. Her conduct has forced me to take away her privileges for the next 30 days. But couldn't you arrange some sort of special interview? Why, our discipline will become the laughing stock of the ward. I counted so much on seeing her. I understand. And I'm very sorry, too. Please tell Nan that if she'll see me I'll come up next month. - Very well. I'll be glad to. - Thank you. More work for you, Nan.

Keep one hand tied behind you, or you'll be back up here again. And we couldn't stand that. I'm gonna tell him all about you. I'm gonna tell him what kind of person you really are. Great. And here's something else you could tell him. Why, you.. So long. Nan, your 30 day punishment isn't up until Saturday. But Mr. Slade is here again. And Miss Johnson has agreed to let you see him. - That's if you still want to. - I sure do. Since it's a special favor you're to report to the matron's office. Do I have to go like this? I'll give you a pass. - Go to your cell and change. - Oh, gee, thanks. Come on. Hello, Nan. Hello, Dave. Well, I guess I'm supposed to break down and weep. Well, I could hardly picture that. Neither could I. I realize now, that you only did what you thought was right. I tried to hate you, but I couldn't. Because I knew all along that I was wrong. Well, I guess there's another reason. Yes? It's the same one that kept you writing to me. And keep on coming up here to see me. - Here you are, Miss Graham. - Thanks. - Nice day, isn't it? - Yes, it is. Oh, say, this Lefty fellow ain't here no more. Know his forwarding address? Well, just now, it's the county jail. They took him away last night. Oh, I see. Never can tell anymore, can you? No, you can't. Seemed such a nice fellow, too. 'Hello. County jail.' 'Chief Jailer's office. Cassidy speaking.' 'What? No, the chief is busy. Any message?' 'Clark? Alright. I'll tell him.' Hello. Get the warden of the penitentiary on the phone. At once. - Did you ring, chief? - Yeah. Send this to the warden at the penitentiary. By special messenger. Make it snappy. - Okay, chief. - Well, Frank. Here's the report on the key, Warden. Looks pretty bad. B-9-4-7. Key to main cell block. Women's section, letter traced to prisoner 6142. Cell 76, second tier right. Sound the alarm, Joe. Get down to the prison as fast as you can. I'll be there soon. - Let's go, Dutch. - Good luck, kid. Thanks. 'Hey! Can that music.' 'You're driving me batty.' They're crushing through the second tier. That's the last cell on the right. The last cell on the right? That's Nan Taylor's cell. Come on, stick 'em up, you guys! Come on. When did the warden hear about this? - About five minutes ago. - What is it, Miss Johnson? Noonan, get all the girls downstairs as fast as you can. Open up the cells. Get the girls to the big room. - Come on, get out. - What's the beef now? You keep still and obey orders. Come on, get out of here. Quit your starin', and do what you're told. Come on. Come on, boys. Don! Well, you certainly made a mess out of things, didn't you? 'I suppose you know what this will to mean to you.' 'The parole board will turn you down.' 'You'll do your full term without privileges.' No visitors, no letters, no anything, except hard work. You might as well get this into your mind right now. Another stunt like this and they'll be adding to your sentence. 'How'd you get that?' Doesn't matter how I got it. That's enough. You're responsible for the death of two men. Your pals. I'd hate to have that on my conscience. Don't worry about my conscience, sweetheart. I'm not responsible for their deaths, but I know who is. And I'll get even with that dirty, yellow stool pigeon if it takes the rest of my life! Hello, Nan. Well, if it isn't old Dead Eye Dick himself. Gee, you look like a million-dollar bonus. Put on a little weight, haven't you, Tracy? Yeah, I generally fatten up this time of the year. - When did you get out? - Yesterday. No hard feeling. No, say, you have your racket, and I have mine. Sometimes, they don't mix so well, huh? Sure. Don't tell me you gone and got religion at this late date. That would be a break for you coppers. Well, so long, Nan. I'll tell the headquarters you're in circulation again. - They'll be glad to know it. - You would. - Goodbye. - So long. ♪ Nevermore to roam ♪ ♪ Open wide thine arms of love ♪ ♪ Lord I'm coming home ♪ Come, my friends. Join with these others who have come forward feeling the need of spiritual guidance. And our good friend, their leader, David Slade will be only too happy to advice and help you 'as he has helped thousands of others.' Happy to have you with us. Nan! - Mr. Farnum. - 'Yes, sir.' - Take this lady to my study. - Yes, sir. - I'll be with you in a minute. - This way, please. Right this way, please. Just make yourself at home, miss. I knew you were getting out yesterday and I phoned that I'd meet you. But you had gone. You see, I didn't waste any time getting here. And I appreciate it. Now I don't have to tell you what you mean to me, Nan. From the first moment we met I hoped that someday, we might find happiness together. It's been mighty difficult for me to see things from your viewpoint. But I think, at last, I understand. I've been wrong all my life. And we can start over again, can't we? I want to show you something first, David. Did you ever see them? I recognize you, but I don't know these men. No. No, I guess not. You never saw them. They're dead now. Dead. I don't know what you mean. Why didn't you mail that letter? - Why didn't you mail it? - What letter? Letter you found in your pocket the last time you saw me. - I did mail it. - You double-crossing liar. You turned it over to the cops. - I swear, I didn't... - You're a liar! You've been from the start. You came with your pious promises of help. You were gonna make me forget the past. Yeah, with that two to five year rap. But you were gonna see that I got out because you love me. I was sap enough to fall for it. You love me enough to have another year added to my time. - I don't understand what... - There's two kids they got. Their brains are in alcohol in little jars for curious visitor to gape at, property of that state! And you murdered them. - You've got to listen. - I've listened enough. I'm forgetting about you, but you're gonna hear about me every day of your lyin', hypocritical life. You gonna read about me in the papers for every crime in the world, from every city in the world. And let this cheer you. It'll be you who's done it. - You can't... - Try to stop me! You can't do it, you understand? You can't do it! Because I love you. If you put your hands on me again, I'll.. I'll kill you. Please, Nan.. David. David. That sounded like a shot. I didn't mean to do that. Well, that's alright, Nan. It's nothing. You let me handle this. Come in. What's the matter? We thought we heard a shot. Like it was in here. A shot? Oh, yes. I did hear something. I suppose it was an automobile backfiring out there. I'm sorry we disturbed you. We didn't know anyone was with you. There she is. - She tried to kill him. - Susie! I saw her draw a gun and tried to kill you. - You're imagining things. - Oh, no, I'm not. You're protecting her because you love her. Wait a minute. Quite, sister. - What's this all about? - 'I don't know.' Oh, yes, you do. You're trying to save her. Now you are making pretty serious charges, young lady. You'll have to prove, or there'll be trouble. I'm not lying. I'm not blind. I saw her with a gun. How did you see me, Susie? Right through that keyhole. I saw every move you made. You must have pretty good eyes, young lady to see through that sign. - Why, you... - Perhaps, Susie need you.. I tell you I'm not lying. Well, now that the gallery is gone what's it all about, Dave? 'There is nothing to tell, Tracy.' No? Well, I ran into Nan a while ago. And I thought something funny might happen. So I hung around. - Looks like it did. - I tell you, you're wrong. 'Nan hasn't done anything.' She's here on a personal matter. Yeah? Sure you're not covering up for her? I never cover up for anybody. - You know that. - Looks kinda of funny to me. Can you keep a secret? Why, sure. Well, Tracy.. Nan and I are going to be married. Oh, you are kidding. - What, you marrying Nan Taylor? - Isn't that right, Nan? - Well.. - He said so, didn't he? Okay. And if you say that's why she came here tonight it's okay with me. Dave Slade and Nan Taylor. Well, I'll be doggone. Well, so long, Nan. Bye, Dave. See you in church. And oh, Dave. I don't want to butt in but if I was you, I'd have a doctor look at that arm. Bullet wounds can be troublesome. He's right about that, David. You have to see the doctor now. You didn't mean what you said about us getting married. Did you? Well, that was your idea, wasn't it? Well, can you beat that? She's actually has gone and married that David Slade. - Who? - That's a good picture of her. You know, Nan was a swell kid. - I hated to see her gone. - You bet. She's knock 'em cold in my beauty parlor.
