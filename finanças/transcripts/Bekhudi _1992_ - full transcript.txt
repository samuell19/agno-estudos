That any beautiful, innocent girl should come and meet Rohit Gupta from law college. Nisha, I'm not joking! Excuse me. Yes? Your book had fallen outside the law college.

"When we grow up." "Wonder where we'd be." "But wherever we are, we will complain." "Will remember you!" "When we grow up." Rohit! - Back from court, dad? For your kind information, I'm going to the court. Is it morning already? Guess I've to set up a court in this house too. Why, dad? Because, I think there're more chances of crime happening here. Or, have you already committed one. What do you mean? When you find your son engrossed in solitude. When his words are not with him while talking. Or when someone continuously preys his mind. What can you say? - What? He's in love! Yes Papa, I'm in love! Who's the girl? What's her name? Don't know. Where does she stay? - Don't know. Her parents? - Don't know. Does she love you? - Don't know. Oh, Rohit! Rohit! Find out then. You're amazing! I'm signalling you for so long, and you don't even Listen, what's your name? Radhika. Radhika! And your name? - Come on, Radhika! Let's go. "When the crazy heart didn't listen." "I picked up the pen, my love." "Wrote your name on the letter," "wrote about the state of my heart." "Wrote your name on the letter," "wrote about the state of my heart." "When the crazy heart didn't listen." "I picked up the pen, my love." "Wrote your name on the letter," "wrote about the state of my heart." "Wrote your name on the letter," "wrote about the state of my heart." "Think of this piece of paper as a heart."

At present, all I know about her is that her name is Radhika. Congratulations! You've managed that at least. Now take her address. - Why? So that, if ever the need arises you can take a helicopter and go to her terrace. Nisha! -My dear lover boy! Listen to me. Write a footnote .. ..'to be continued' under this love story and study for your final exams. Rocky, what are you doing? Looking for the answer for question no. 4. Keep that text book. - Shut up! I'll complain to the principal. Stand there quietly. Rocky, what's going on? Can't you see? What do you think? That being a rich man's son, you can do anything? You think you can cheat? Get out. Your honor, the accused, Rajesh Nath in spite of police surveillance, showed the invigilator a knife. He threatened to kill her. Not just that. He even affronted and slapped the principal. Before I make a decision I'd like to meet Rakesh Nath and the principal in my chamber. I called you here so that you realize your error stemmed out of anger. So that you don't have to face the punishment. I got it! Tell me, if I've broken a law, .. ..what fine should I pay? Fine? - Forget it, judge. I know very well why you've called me in your chambers in private. After all, what does a college principal and a judge get? 5000? 7000? A rich man's son spends that much in one night's fling. Am I right? Absolutely right! Now tell me. What will I have to give? The big take from the small! Doesn't gel! Right, Mr. Principal? - What? The mistake isn't his. It's yours. Mine? - Remember the time when you were a student. If we'd done something like this, what would be the punishment? His teachers didn't give him that punishment. One that he'd get now. Rascal! That's the punishment you should've got at school. The punishment of the law is something you'd get in the court. Teachers are the builders of the nation! Insulting the teacher is an affront to the whole society. It's like insulting the whole country. For the crime of showing a knife to the teacher, hand threatening to kill her this court, under the Indian Penal Code section 323 sentences Mr. Rakesh Nath to 7 days imprisonment. And to keep the college discipline intact, this court recommends the college authority to rusticate the accused. My son cannot be in a jail for 7 days. Go meet some minister. Do something! Mom! What happened? - That Rocky. He went to Nainital with his friends without telling him. And so, he's angry. Oh relax, dad! Nisha! There's a party at my place tomorrow. I know it's your birthday tomorrow. And, like every year, you'll celebrate with your friends. How boring, Rohit! - Why? Take my advice. Spend this special day alone with your new friend. Good idea! But, will Radhika agree? Depends on how you invite her. Fine, I'll talk to her right away. Radhika! - You, here? Radhika! Radhika! Radhika! - Go from here, Rohit. It's my birthday tomorrow. Will you come out with me for lunch? Yes, I will, but for now, go away. Are you sure you'll come? - I'll surely come. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Tomorrow, at 1, at Phulwari restaurant. Okay! - Sharp 1 o'clock.f - I heard you, Rohit. You'll definitely come, right? - Yes, Rohit! Are you sure you'll come? - Yes. Oh god! I have a lunch appointment with Radhika! Hi, papa! Where are you going so late at night? I've a lunch appointment. Lunch? Where's the appointment? Singapore? Bangkok? Tokyo? - What? It will be lunch time only in these places. Father, my appointment is at one in the afternoon. It's four in the morning now. Papa, I don't want to be late. You go to sleep. I have a dinner appointment too. Let me get ready too. Getting ready for dinner now? How silly! Good morning! I have a lunch appointment in your restaurant. You have a lunch appointment so early in the morning? Yes. Your lunch appointment is with a girl, right? But, how do you know? Are you a fortune teller? No. A girl's come before you, and she has a lunch appointment too. Hi! Hi! Happy birthday! Thank you! I'm so sorry! For what? - I got late. You're not late. I came a bit too early. Waiter! Waiter! Yes, tell me. - What can we get to eat? Nothing, because the buffalo hasn't given the milk yet. And the hen hasn't laid the egg yet. Okay! Get 2 Thums up quickly. Okay! You get very good food in this place. But, I guess, we've come a bit too early. It's okay. We'll get food after 4 to 5 hours. Here, 2 Thums-up. Happy birthday! - Thank you! Waiter.. Will you order lunch? I'm full! - I'm full too. Let's go. - Yes. Come on! Seems to be addicts! Pretty late! The time just flew by! Let me take you for a drive. Where's your driver? - Why do we need a driver? I'll drive my car. - Do you have a license? Don't be silly, Rohit. Who asks for a license? But you're just 17. You're not supposed to drive. Of course, I can drive. Radhika, what are you doing? Radhika, slow down. Radhika stop the car. Stop the car! Radhika! Radhika! Careful! Radhika! Radhika stop! Radhika stop! Radhika stop the car! Radhika! Radhika, press the brake! Radhika! How is it dark? - I don't know. Thank god we survived to see our next birthday! Come, I'll drop you home. Come on. - Tell me, where's your house? Wherever yours is. - Stop joking. How will I take you home if you don't tell me your address? Then, take me to your house. - Do you want to go? I want to. - Where? Home. "How do I know where your house is?" "How do I know where your house is?" "How do I know where your house is?" "Take me wherever you want to?" "Take me wherever you want to?" "How do I know where your house is?" "How do I know where your house is?" "Take me wherever you want to?" "Take me wherever you want to?" "I'm scared, it's so dark." "To me, this looks like a place for ghosts." "I'm scared, it's so dark." "To me, this looks like a place for ghosts." "I'm crazy about you, and you love me." "Why do you fear treading the paths of love?" "Don't test me." "How do I know where your house is?" "How do I know where your house is?" "Take me wherever you want to?" "Take me wherever you want to?" "Nobody comes nor goes." "Even a waft of breeze raises my heartbeat." "Nobody comes nor goes." "Even a waft of breeze raises my heartbeat." "Come my love, let me embrace you." "People in love meet in places like these." "I'd never seen such a world before." "How do I know where your house is?" "How do I know where your house is?" "Take me wherever you want to?" "Take me wherever you want to?" "I don't want to go home today." "I don't want to go home today." "Your folks will wait for you." "People's tongues would wag." "Look, don't repent later." "I don't want to go home today." "Look, don't repent later." "I don't want to go home today." Hi rocky! Welcome, Rocky! - Hi! - Hi! Mom! How are you, son? I'm okay, mom. - Come on, come home. No, mom. I'll go to college. What will you do going to college? I can't go to court and meet Justice Gupta. But I can go to college and meet his son, Rohit. Rocky, look! Rohit's friend, Nisha. Where is Rohit? I don't know. You know where Rohit is. Save me! Help me! Please help me! Please.. Nobody will help you here besides me. Going to jail didn't do you any good too, Rocky! A dog like you can never ever mend his ways! Stop it, Rocky! How dare you come here? You've been rusticated from college. Don't force me to call the police again. Now get out from here! Rohit, your father sent me to jail for 7 days. I'll avenge every minute of those 7 days. If not in college, then outside! What's wrong, Nisha? Why are you crying? Sir, that Rocky.. Come. My driver will drop you home. She's a bit shocked, sir. I'll drop her home myself. Okay! - Susan, pass Nisha's shirt. It's okay! It's over now! Enough! Radhika? Radhika. Radhika, What are you doing? Stop it, Radhika! Stop it! Stupid idiot! Who? - Hello auntie, I'm Radhika's college mate. Who is it? Radhika! Hi! - I hate you! - Radhika. What are you doing? You're wrong. I'm not Rohit's girlfriend. You're lying! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Radhika, just listen to me. Radhika, I know Rohit for about 3 to 4 years. He's my friend. - Shut up! If there was something between us, why would I come to explain? To make me jealous. Radhika, Rohit loves you! Don't lie. - He loves you a lot. Thanks a lot, buddy! I'll return the bike by evening. Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! "With the images of your dewy dreams." "With the fetters of your silken tresses." "With the images of your dewy dreams." Rohit! I'm sorry, Rohit! Rohit! - Please listen! Listen to me. Rohit! Rohit! Listen to me, Rohit! Rohit. Listen to me. Rohit. - Yes! I love you. Why don't we get married? - Sure. But after you're 18. But I don't understand. What does marriage have to do with me being 18? The law doesn't give permission to marry a minor. Law? What can the law do? Want to know? - Yes. Come! This is the court. The temple of the law. Just imagine the court to be filled. Lawyers all around, and you standing there. In law, the consent of a minor is no consent at all. That means, a minor's consent has no bearing with the law. And Radhika isn't 18 as yet. She is a minor. Yes, she is a minor. Yes, Radhika is seventeen and a half years old. But if the marriage is held today or 6 months later, what difference does it make? It makes a difference. It makes a difference to emotions. Your honor, maybe in 6 months time, Radhika might forget Rohit. That's all, your honor. That was the case. Now hear the court's decision. Order! Order! This court considers this case as kidnapping and abduction. And, under Indian Penal Code section 361 and 493 sentences Rohit Kumar to 7 years of jail. Radhika, what are you doing? Who are you to separate me from my Rohit? I hate you and I hate your goddamn court too. Radhika! I was joking. Stop crying. Rohit, if we ever get separated. This is what my state would be out of crying! I cannot live without you, Rohit! If you can't live without me, live with my memory. "Whenever you miss me, and you're in a bad state." "Whenever you miss me, and you're in a bad state." "Then, look at this kerchief and remember me." "Whenever you miss me, and you're in a bad state." "Then, look at this kerchief and remember me." "Whenever you miss me, the heart will ask questions." "Then, look at this kerchief and remember me." "Sit close to me, I'll tell you about myself." "Sit close to me,tell you about myself." "I shudder to think how it'd be to live without you." "Staying away from you for a few days." "It's difficult, I'm scared." "Being away from you for a mere moment." "Is like living death."

Hello, Shobha! - Brother! Sister-in-law! I'd heard that people eat a lot in Canada. And you prove the point! You've put on 10 kgs in 10 years for sure. - Good program! Hello, aunty!

I'm going. She must be waiting. Brother, you can't get a better boy than Vicky for Radhika. But Shobha, children these days don't like their parents deciding about their marriage. Hi, aunty! Hello, my sweet little Radhika! Remember the last time I came, I picked you up like this. I won't lift you, but put you in the plane, and take you to Canada. That too, as a bride! Bride? Bride? Yes! The boy's name is Vikram Malhotra. I've got him from Canada so you can meet him. He must be on his way with Rocky. - Aunty! Greetings! Hello vicky! Come, meet them. This is my big brother, Mr. Nath. My sister-in-law, Nalini. And this is our Radhika. Hello! You want to marry me? Yes! - Radhika! Do you know the Indian law? I'm a minor. I'm not 18 as yet. And if you marry me. Do you know what'll happen? - What? You'll have to go to court. Anyway, I have to go for the wedding. I'll get ready. Bye! Radhika, what took you so long? I told you my aunt's come from Edmonton.

So, you are Radhika's brother? How do you know Radhika? - Rocky! What's the problem? He's trying to forcibly enter our house. Greetings, uncle! My name's Rohit Gupta. I want to meet Radhika. - At this hour? There's a function in college. Have to make arrangements. What function? One minute, Rocky. Radhika is sleeping now. - Yes! Call her up tomorrow. - Okay! Greetings, uncle! Bye. Damn! - What did you say? Come in, Rocky. Father, do you know? He is that Justice Gupta's son. Come in. Radhika! Radhika! Radhika! Are you sleeping? Radhika, get up. Radhika! I've got very good news. Dad's found out everything about us. Now, these sweet hands will be in mine forever. And I'll kiss them everyday, all day long! Radhika, you're happy, right? Bad program. Brother! - What is it, Shobha? Just now, a hand came into Radhika's room from the window. A hand? - Yes, a strong and young hand. I caught him, but he escaped. I'd say, shut that window pronto. Why are you laughing? Radhika refused to marry Vicky. Do you know why? - Why? Because of the hand that came in from the window. Go sleep. I'll speak to Radhika in the morning. That means, the boy at the window is welcome through the door. And my Vicky has to leave from the window! Bad program. Radhika. - Yes, dad! Come here. Sit. What's it, dad? Are you in love? Papa! Give me an answer. Yes or no? Yes. What's his name? - Rohit Gupta! Hello. Gupta here. Mr. Gupta, Mahendra Nath here. Good you called. I wanted to talk to you. We'll meet at my hotel this evening. We'll talk there. As you wish. I'll wait for you in the lobby at 7.00 p.m. Okay? Bye! Rohit! Nalini, we've two guests coming over for dinner. - Who? Justice Gupta and his son, Rohit. What? The judge is coming to the hotel in the evening. I'll invite him for dinner then. But why? I'm fixing Radhika's engagement with his son Rohit. What are you saying? - Nalini, Radhika loves Rohit. And I like this alliance. - But we don't, absolutely. The man who got our son rusticated, and sent to jail. You want our Radhika to marry that man's son? This won't happen, dad! That judge's son cannot be a member of our family. Why? Who was caught copying in the exams? You, or Justice Gupta? Who misbehaved with the principal? You, or Justice Gupta? I can't deprive my daughter her happiness because of your wayward ways. What have you come here for? I've come to meet your father, son. Don't you dare call me son! What nonsense is this? Get out of here if you value your life. Behave yourself. I'll teach you how to behave. What happened, dad? What did Mr. Nath say? Son, forget Radhika. Why? Try to understand, son. But why? What happened, father? - That Rocky.. Papa, Rocky did this? Rocky! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit, at least listen to me. Your father didn't come? Rohit! You hit my dad! Hit him! Hit him! What do you think of yourself? Catch the rascal. What if you are the owner?! l will kill you! Rocky! No Rohit! I am sorry Rohit. Please don't kill me. Forgive me, Rohit. Please Rohit, I am sorry. Leave me. Rocky! Rocky! Radhika! What happened, mom? What happened, mom? Tell me, mom. What happened? In the hotel, Rocky and Rohit. Rocky? What did Rocky do to Rohit? What did he do? - You're asking what Rocky did to Rohit? Yes, mom. What did Rocky do to Rohit? Your Rohit killed my Rocky. Mom! Your love took my son's life! Killed him! Killed him! Brother! Rocky! I'm very sorry, Mr. Nath! I regret it. Commissioner, have you arrested Rohit Gupta? Besides the inspector's report, I have read the entire enquiry. Rocky's death was just an accident. As per the eye witnesses, Rohit tried to save Rocky. - That's a lie. My son has been killed! He has been murdered. And the murderer is.. He is my son's murderer! I won't spare you today. No, Mr.Nath! - I won't let you live! His pyre will be lit here too! His pyre will be lit here too! So what if you are a judge's son! I won't spare you. I swear, dad! I tried to save Rocky. Son, I know you're innocent. A father who's lost a young son cannot believe the truth. The flight is at 9.45. You'll reach on time. If not for the property case, I wouldn't have gone to Bangalore But.. - No, you go. You have to. You also resume work now. Only if you meet people will you forget this sorrow. Consider our time with Rocky was meant to be just this much. Tell sister-in-law to take care of Radhika. I'll leave. Radhika, Think of the past as a bad dream, and forget it. Rohit wasn't fit for you. He didn't even think that Rocky was your only brother. And he killed him Why are you'll falsely accusing him? People have seen whatever happened at the hotel. Yet, you people shunt yourself from the truth. The truth is that our son has been snatched away from us. And Rohit is responsible for that. Only Rohit. We can never forgive him. Never. Radhika! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! How dare you come here? How did you dare come here? Rohit! - Shameless, get out of here. Get out! Come here again, and I'll sever your limbs! I'll kill you! Get out. "When someone writes the story of love." "The first thing he'll do is call me crazy." "I'm one who loves, I will love." "I'm one who loves, I will love." "I live in love."

I warn you from meeting Mr. Nath's daughter henceforth. Furthermore, you won't go even 100 feet close to their house. What's this? - It's the police's order. That I'd be 100 ft away from Radhika's house. It measures 100 ft here. I'll wait for Radhika here. Wait all your life! Forget about meeting her, you won't even be able to go near her. The police has ordered Rohit to be away from me. They haven't told me to be far from Rohit. Radhika! I'll permanently end your trysts with Rohit. Nalini, pack up her stuff. Call up Shobha. Tell her to take Radhika with her to Canada. She'll get her married to Vicky there. - No! Come, child! This is our hotel. Good program, right? You go rest in my suite. You must be very tired! Mike. Telephone. Brother. - Yes, Shobha, you've reached safely? Yes, we reached peacefully. How is Radhika? Quiet, but nothing to be worried out. Bye, brother. Okay, Shobha. Thank you! You? Where is Radhika? Radhika is not here now. Soon, she is going to get married in Canada. Hello, sir! Has Rohit come? - He's on the terrace. Did he eat? - No, sir. Rohit! What's wrong? They've sent Radhika to Canada. Her aunt's getting her married there. Why won't she? Who will stop her? You, one who sits day and night with a sullen face? What do I do then, dad?

Well, we didn't have a place to sleep. And, we've run away from home. Run away from home? But what are you doing in my house? A fraud got us here. Told us it's his house. We're telling the truth, sir. Fact of the matter is.. Radhika! Vicky? You know him? Rohit, I'd told you aunty, Edmonton, a boy. When I'd gone to India to meet Radhika she gave me a big lecture on law. And now I know who the lecturer was. I know now that you've eloped. But Radhika, what's the problem? She's just a child. Just 17 years old. And that boy. Bad program. As soon as we know something, we'll let you know. Thank you! - Welcome! So, you want to get married. And this marriage isn't possible till Radhika turns 18. Radhika's 18th birthday is a week away. And what if you get caught in this one week? Don't worry. You won't get caught. You stay here. No one will know about you. I'll get you married after a week. Vicky! Radhika, are you happy? Thank you Vicky! - Oh, come on Rohit! The police has no information as yet. About Radhika, you know? That fool! Yes! Shobha here! Hello, Nalini here. Oh, sister-in-law, I thought it was the police calling. Why will the police call? Sister-in-law.. I'd reported my dog being lost. Sister, we're reaching there on the 7th of September. Where, here? - Yes, there. Radhika! - Yes. Your towel. - Hang it outside. Fine, I'm going for work. - Okay, bye! Hey you! You! Who are you? - I work here. Here, in the house? - No, in the saw mill. Saw mill? I've seen you somewhere. Must have seen me in the saw mill. I'll send Vicky. I've definitely seen him somewhere.

Check! - Rohit, Yes Vicky has clicked some very good snaps. Really? Where are they? - In the room. I'll go see them. Excuse me. Can I play? - Oh, sure! What happened? - I don't know. Tomorrow, I'll be the first to wish you on your birthday. And then the priest will come. And.. What is it, Radhika? What are you thinking about? I don't know why, Rohit. As the moment closes in, I feel a bit scared! - Rohit! These are some important documents. Have to reach Edmonton today itself. Take my van. Rohit! Don't go. - Why? I'm feeling scared. Vicky has suddenly changed, Rohit. Looks like.. - What? As if he.. Let's go from here, Rohit. Lets go from here. It's only till tomorrow. I'll be back in just 2 hours.? Bye. - Bye. Vicky, who went in that helicopter? Radhika's parents with Radhika. What? Radhika's parents took her? Yes. And you let Radhika go? You! One who befriended me! One who was supposed to get us married! - Forget it, Rohit! Listen to this carefully. Radhika is getting married to me, not you. Vicky, you cannot marry Radhika. You know very well that she doesn't love you. After marriage, she will. I will teach her to love. Never! I'm her love! Radhika is.. - Beware, don't you dare mention her. Radhika is mine! She was mine right from the beginning. Her parents sent her to Canada for me. I'm getting married to her tomorrow. Tomorrow, Radhika will be mine. She can never be yours! With you around, I can't get married, right? What if you aren't around? Nobody can come between Radhika and me. I'll kill whoever comes between us. Ismile, It's my niece's wedding tomorrow. You know wedding! That lawn section will be closed for the hotel guests. I don't want no disturbance. And for the marriage, I want the best. Best. - Good program. No, I won't marry Vicky! Crying won't fetch you anything. You have to marry Vicky. I will marry Rohit. Rohit! You? Who did this to you? Take me to Radhika. You've lost her again? Radhika's aunt's hotel is 25 miles from here. Please take me there quickly, Rambo. Please! Damn Rambo! Rambhau will take you there in 10 minutes. Come in. Radhika, this is your bridal outfit. Wear it. - I won't. Don't be stubborn, child. Why do you want to forcefully get me married? Brother, the priest is here. Radhika, you aren't ready as yet? Why do you want to marry me? I love you! - But I don't! Even then, I love you! You're lying. Not me, it's my body you want. You want my body, right? Take it. Radhika! Go. Hail India! I won't marry anyone else. I will marry only Rohit. Radhika! Rohit! Radhika! Rohit, I'm coming. Leave me, Vicky. Radhika, I'm here. Control yourself! - Let me go! Radhika! Leave him. Rohit! Leave him. You want me to spare Rohit, don't you? - Yes. Then, you'll have to pay for that. Rohit, I want to invite you for my marriage with Radhika. Radhika will never marry you. Don't believe it? See for yourself. See that. Have a happy wedding! Rohit, I want to ask you something. Have you ever seen a girl being raped? Then see it today. Watch my rape. That too, in front of my parent's eyes. Radhika, what are you saying? Why? Being forceful with a girl is called rape, dad! You getting me married against my wishes is my rape indeed! We're doing this marriage for your good. No, mom. You're doing this for your happiness. You want to hold a corpse and take it round this nuptial fire. You've decorated a corpse and called it a bride. Radhika. Stop it! A marriage is for a boy and a girl's happiness. Did you think about my happiness? I'll be forced. There'd be religious chants. Blessings will be given. But what's the use of those religious chants? Ones which don't emanate from the heart? What's the use of blessing me with happiness when you all know I won't be happy with Vicky at all? Priest, begin the joke of these traditions. And light a flame to my funeral pyre. Radhika! Break these handcuffs. Remove this noose. Aunty, what's going on? Just shut up Vicky! Radhika will marry of her own choice, got it? If Radhika isn't mine, she won't be anybody else's too. Vicky, leave him! Go down. Down. Radhika! Radhika, are you okay? Vicky! Go ahead! Get him! Get him! Go. Radhika! Radhika! Radhika! Radhika! Radhika! Get up, Radhika. Open your eyes. You can't leave me, Radhika. Get up, Radhika. Get up, Radhika. Open your eyes, Radhika. Get up, Radhika! Radhika! Radhika! Radhika! Get up! Get up, Radhika! Radhika! Rohit! Radhika! Radhika! Hey, you! Have you ever flown a helicopter? Singapore Airlines, Flight SQ64 to Bangkok Son, hasn't your father come?
