Dear Evan Hansen... Today is going to be an amazing day, and here's why. Because today, all you have to do is just be yourself. But also confident. That's-that's important. And interesting. Easy to talk to. Approachable. But mostly just be yourself. You know, that's number one, obviously. Be yourself. But, like, a confident version of yourself, like, approachable and interesting and not weird or anxious or depressed. But you're not weird or anxious or depressed. I don't even know why you're bringing it up. You can't be scared to talk to other people. You said that you'd be better. You said this year would be different. You're over-thinking it. Do you like having no friends? All you have to do is just be yourself. ♪ I've learned to slam on the brake ♪ ♪ Before I even turn the key ♪ ♪ Before I make the mistake ♪ ♪ Before I lead with the worst of me ♪ ♪ Give them no reason to stare ♪ ♪ No slipping up if you slip away ♪ ♪ So I got nothing to share ♪ ♪ No, I got nothing to say ♪ ♪ Step out, step out of the sun ♪ ♪ If you keep getting burned ♪ ♪ Step out, step out of the sun because you've learned ♪ ♪ Because you've learned ♪ ♪ On the outside always looking in ♪ ♪ Will I ever be more than I've always been? ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass ♪ ♪ I'm waving through a window ♪ ♪ Oh, I try to speak, but nobody can hear ♪ ♪ So I wait around for an answer to appear ♪ ♪ While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass ♪ ♪ I'm waving through a window ♪ ♪ Can anybody see? ♪ ♪ Is anybody waving back at me? ♪ So you just didn't eat last night?

Okay, well, that's not, that's not true, actually, though, because, um, the credit card's expired, so you have to meet the delivery person at the door, you know? You have to pay them with cash at the door. You have to greet them. You know, you have to figure out the right, the right, um... The-the proper greeting. Okay. This is what you're supposed to be working on, sweetheart, with Dr. Sherman. Have you been doing those letters he wants you to do? "Dear Evan Hansen." I mean, I've definitely... I-I've been trying to. Those letters are important, honey. You have to keep working. We can't go back to where you were last year, right? Um, you have an appointment this afternoon. I'm working till 6:00, so you're gonna have to take the bus. Hey. I thought you could go around and ask all the other kids to sign your cast. Perfect icebreaker, right? - What happened to your shirt? - There was a stain on it. - Wha... but it's brand-new. - Yes, I know. I was...

What? It's Zoe Murphy in that hot band shirt you love so much. Can you just... Can you please stop? Well, hey, maybe she's into you, too. Maybe you should talk to her, tell her how you feel. I've tried talking to her. Really? Yes. Yeah, I... I stayed afterwards, um, last year after the spring jazz band concert, but, um, I didn't go up to her because I was worried that my hands were sweaty. Which they weren't even, they weren't even that sweaty. I just... I was worried that they were sweaty, and sometimes worrying that they're sweaty makes them sweaty, so I just went to the bathroom and I put 'em under, like, the hand dryer thing, but then they were still sweaty. They were just, um... They were just also warm. I was kidding. You obviously should not talk to her. You are a literal disaster. Go, bobcats! Go, bobcats. So awesome. So awesome, everyone. Phenomenal, really. You know what's not phenomenal? Deforestation. So, what happened to your arm exactly? Um, I was climbing a tree, and I fell. It was stupid. You fell out of a tree? What are you, five? Well, um... So, actually, I-I worked this summer as an apprentice park ranger at Ellison state park. It's a funny story, though, because... There was, like, this solid ten minutes after I fell where I just lay there on the ground, um, waiting for someone to come get me, you know? I was like, "any second now." You know? I just kept... I, like... I was saying to myself, "any second now. Here they come." So... Did they? No, nobody came. That's the, um... That's what's funny. That's not funny. Model U.N... Well, anyways, um, how was... Did you, um... How was camp? Well, I put on 13 pounds of pure muscle. Also, I hooked up with this Brazilian dude who is literally a supermodel. So, yeah, hope that answers your question. So let's have mother nature's back so that she'll have ours. Yeah! Yeah! All right, thank you, Alana. Very inspirational. All right, so let's have a great year, and, uh, go, bobcats! Hey, um... Would you want to sign my cast? Uh, you could, you could be the first. Why would I do that? Well, I just... I thought, um, because we're friends and... We're family friends, Evan. That's an entirely different thing. Please respect that. Connor, I'm loving this manicure. - Very school shooter chic. - You're such an idiot. That is so not... ♪ Here we go, bobcats, here we go. ♪ You think that's funny? What? No. Not-not at all. Then stop laughing! Hey. I'm sorry about my brother. He's a psycho. Evan, right? Evan? That-that's your, that's your name? Y-Yeah, it is. It is. Sorry. It's Evan. It's Evan. I'm sorry. Why are you sorry? 'Cause you s-s... you said Evan, and then I said it, you know? I just repeated it, which is, um... That's just really annoying when people do that, so... I'm Zoe. Sorry. I should... I think... sorry. Dear Evan Hansen, turns out this wasn't an amazing day after all. This isn't gonna be an amazing week or an amazing year because why would it be? Oh, I know. Because there's Zoe. Who I don't even know and who doesn't know me, but... Maybe if I did, maybe if I could just talk to her, maybe things would be better. Or... Maybe nothing would be different at all. I wish everything was different. I wish I was different. I wish I was part of something. I wish that anything I said mattered to anyone. But it doesn't, and it never did. And it never will. I mean, face it, would anyone even notice if I just... Disappeared tomorrow? Sincerely, your best and most dearest friend, me. Hey. What happened to your arm? I was climbing a tree, and I fell. You fell out of a tree? That's the saddest thing I've ever heard. I know. S-Sorry, um, I think I accidentally printed something. Yeah, we're all waiting. Um, no one signed your cast. No, I-I know. I'll sign it. Oh, you don't... You really don't have to... Do you have a sharpie? Oh, um, I don't. Shoot. Oh, here's one. Nice. Wow, that's great. Now we can both pretend we have friends. Uh, "dear Evan Hansen." Here you go. Y-Yeah, that's mine. That's mine. - I'll... I can take it, sorry. - "Because there's Zoe..." Is this about my sister? What? No, no. Who's-who's your sister? - You wanted me to find this? - What? You saw I was here, so you started writing this - and you started talking to me. - No. No, you started talking to me. So that I would read some creepy shit about my sister and freak out, right? - Why would I do that? - So then you can tell everyone that I'm crazy. Right? - Right?! - Gentlemen! No, I really... Look, I really need that back, so can... Look, can you please just give it back? Just-just please don't show it to anyone. Connor! Come on. Shit, shit. Hi. Hi, honey. I'm so sorry. Erica called in at the last minute with a stomach bug, and there's only one other nurse on tonight, so I-I volunteered to take her shift. I hope you weren't waiting for me to eat. - No, I already ate. - Um, it's just they, uh, they announced more budget cuts this morning, so anything I can do to show that I'm a team player, you know? - How was your day? - Fine. It was, it was pretty good. Yeah? You know, I-I texted with Meera this morning, and she said that Jared was really looking forward to seeing you and reconnecting. I thought that was nice. Yeah, he's so nice. - How was Dr. Sherman? - Pretty good. Any change to your meds? Um, no. Oh, god, here he comes. Um, all right, I-i-i... All right, love you. Bye. Okay, I love you... Too. A letter to yourself. I mean, what is that, like some kind of sex thing? No. No, it's not a sex thing. It's... it was an assignment from my therapist. Ew. Why-why are you telling me this? Well, I didn't know who else to tell. You're my only f... family friend. Oh, that's sad. Look, Connor isn't here again today. That's-that's three days in a row. And h-he hasn't done anything with it yet, you know, like put it online or whatever, because I've-I've been checking. So, you know, maybe he just... Maybe he forgot, right? Right. Right. Or maybe he didn't, because he's definitely gonna put it online. Dude, Connor Murphy is batshit. Don't you remember when he threw a printer at Mrs. G in the second grade because he couldn't be line leader? Like, he was seven. Just imagine what he's capable of now. Evan Hansen, please report to Mr. Howard's office. Oh, damn. Evan. Connor Murphy's mother and stepfather are here to see you. They want to speak in private. Hi. Hello. Why don't you go ahead, honey. I'm going as fast as I can. Well, that's not what I said, is it? This is... Connor wanted you to have this. Yeah, we didn't know you were friends. Oh, well, we didn't think Connor had any friends, frankly, and... And then we see this note, and it seems to suggest pretty clearly that you and Connor were, uh... Or at least for Connor... "Dear Evan Hansen." He addressed it to you. He wrote it to you. These are the words that he wanted to share with you. His last words. Connor took his own life. He what? This is all we found with him. He had it folded up in his pocket. But this is... I'm sorry, Connor didn't... He... He didn't write this. Connor didn't, Connor didn't write this. What-what does that mean? Well, he's obviously in shock. - I mean, if Connor didn't write this... - I'm so sorry. Can I just... I should probably go, please. No, you don't understand. This is all that we have. This is the only thing that we have left. - Cynthia, listen to me. - No. No. Don't-don't go. Okay, then you take it. Please take it, okay? No. No, don't go. Don't. Please stay. Please. His best and most dearest friend. That's-that's Connor. Connor Murphy. Holy shit. They invited me for dinner. They want to know more stuff about Connor and me, about our... friendship. - A-And you said yes? - I froze. Well... what are you gonna tell them? I mean, the truth. I-I don't know, man. I mean, are you really gonna tell these people that the only thing they have left of their son is a sex letter that you wrote to yourself? Hey. I'm so sorry. What the hell was that? I don't know. Oh, my god, they were so sad, his parents. I mean, his-his mom was just... I've never seen anyone so sad before. I have to tell them. You're early. Oh. S-Sorry. Sit. I hope you're hungry. So... You and Connor. You probably spent a lot of time together, I bet. So, um, not... Not really, actually. - Uh, the thing is that I... - We looked through his phone. His texts, emails. We didn't find anything from you. Yeah, no, I know. - I know. - He set up different accounts, ones we couldn't find. He knew you read his emails. Well, somebody had to be the bad guy. Well, if you did have any emails or conversations between the two of you, we'd love to see anything. - Well... - Yeah, it's-it's weird. Th-the only time I saw you two together was when he was screaming in your face at school last week. He was screaming at you? Yeah, yeah, um... Well, that wasn't very nice. Well, Connor wasn't very nice, so that actually makes sense. I think that everybody at this table can agree that Connor was, um... A complicated person. No, he was a bad person. - Zoe, please. - Don't pretend like you don't agree with me. You refuse to remember any of the good things. Because there were no good things. What-what were the good things? I'm not having this conversation - in front of our guest. - No, tell us the good things. What were the good things? - Family day at sunny Glen? - Zoe! This is not the time. Who knew rehab could be so much fun? There were good things. I'm not the only one. You remember, right? Right. Of course. Yes, of course there were good things. Tell us something. Please, Evan. Right, um... S... uh, Connor and I... Uh, I d... I don't know, um... We had a really great... We had a really great time together, um... This one day recently. That's something good, um, that I remember. That day. Yeah, that awesome day at the... Um, trees. - Trees? - Never mind, never mind. I'm sorry, I don't, I don't... I shouldn't have said anything, and I-I knew it was stupid, so I'm sorry... You don't mean the orchard, do you? He took you to the apple orchard? - When? - Uh, once. Just-just once. That once. I thought that place closed years ago. Well, the hiking trails are still open though, aren't they? We used to go to the orchard all of the time. We'd do picnics there. Do you remember that, Zoe? Yeah, I do. And you and Connor would fly that little toy plane until you crashed it into the creek. That was an emergency landing. I can't believe that he took you there. I bet you had fun. I bet the two of you... I... I bet that was fun. Yeah. We did. We did. The whole day.

You know, he-he talks about you playing guitar, in one of his emails, at the spring concert last year. Really? Yeah. Does he, does he talk about when he disappeared for two days? But then he called me and asked me to come pick him up. He wanted to come home, but he wasn't ready to talk to you yet, so I took the bus all the way downtown to get him, and guess what. All he really wanted was money. And I gave it to him because I was 12. He was struggling. How about the time he tried to punch through my door, screaming at the top of his lungs, saying he was gonna kill me for no reason? Is that email in there? We're all grieving in our own way.

I mean, unless your stepmother has some trust fund for you that I don't know about with all those fabulous tips - she made cocktail waitressing. - Huh. Right? I got a... I got an email from your school yesterday, um, about that boy that-that killed himself. Connor Murphy? Yeah. I didn't really know him, so... You know, if you ever want to talk about anything... You know, I mean, I mean, I know that lately it feels like I'm-I'm always working. - It's fine. - But I'm-I'm-I'm here, and if I... if I'm not here, I'm just a phone call away or an email or a text, you know, whatever. I know. It says "Connor" on your cast. No, no, yeah. Um... - You said you didn't know him. - Sorry, I didn't. It's in memory, so, like... Y-You know, kids are, like, um... They're writing his name on-on... Lockers and stuff like that. That's lovely. You know, in memory. Hey. Tuesday. What are you doing? When's the last time we did taco Tuesday? That'd be great. Really? Yeah. So the memorial's really just an opportunity for all of us to come together as a community and to remember Connor and celebrate who he was. Would you want to speak or perform? I didn't really know him. I'm sorry. - That's okay. - Bye. Want a wristband? Oh, yes. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. You were friends with him, right? I saw him sign your cast in the library, and you started arguing about something. - Were you friends with him? - We weren't close. We presented together o-on Huck Finn in the tenth grade, but he probably didn't tell you that. Um, no, no, I didn't know. I always really liked him. It seemed like he didn't really care what anyone else thought, and... I thought that was pretty remarkable. Well, I'm putting together a memorial for him at school on Friday. If you wanted to do something... Sorry, I-i... I-I probably w-would rather not, if that's okay. Yeah, sure. If you change your mind... Just text me. Okay. Mom. My mom realized we were out of ice cream, so they went to go get more. Did you park in the driveway? 'Cause if you park on the street, they'll ticket you. The people in this neighborhood are monsters. Um, no, I didn't, I didn't, um... I took the bus. My mom needed the car for work. - What about your dad? - My dad. Um, he lives in Colorado, so... He left when I was seven. That sucks. Mine died when I was one, so... I sort of win. - Sorry. - Thanks. It's fine. I-I don't even really remember him, to be honest. Connor did, though, a little. That's terrible. Yeah. And then Larry showed up, fixed everything. For a while, at least. Yeah. Most people, with Connor, they just would've been like, "see ya," but he's the only dad we ever really knew, so... Wow, your mom... I didn't, I didn't realize. Yeah, well. She's in total denial now. So is Larry. I mean, he didn't even cry at the funeral. I'm sorry. Not as sorry as you're gonna be. - Oh, is-is that the... - Mm-hmm. Gluten-free apple pie? You bet. It-it looks... Inedible? It is. Just be glad we get to have real ice cream. My mom was Buddhist last year, so we couldn't have any animal products. She was b... um, Buddhist last year but not this year? Yep. That's sort of what she does. She gets into a lot of different things. For a while, it was Pilates. The secret. Buddhism. Et cetera. It's cool that she's interested in so much different stuff. Yeah, she's not, though. That's just what happens when you're rich and you don't have a job. You get a little crazy. Well, my mom always says it's better to be rich than poor, so... Yeah, well, your mom's probably never been rich, then. Yeah, you've probably never been poor. Oh, my god, I can't believe I just said that. I'm so sorry. Wow. I didn't realize you were capable of saying something that wasn't nice. I'm n... I'm not. I'm really sorry. You really don't have to keep saying that. Okay. You want to say it again. Yeah, very much so, I do. Why did he write that... In his note? "Because there's Zoe. And I don't even know her, but if I could just talk to her..." Honestly, I really don't know.

Yeah, so it's a student group dedicated to keeping Connor's memory alive. Um, making sure people that need help, they have somewhere they can go. I didn't realize Connor meant this much to people. Well, it's all... I mean, it was all Alana's idea. She thought of the whole thing. That's the young woman who organized the memorial tomorrow. Well, she seems like... - Quite a force. - Yeah. Um, anyways, um... We just wanted to do something. It's-it's r-really cool. There's something I want to show you. Sure. Oh, here we go. It's a bit of a mess, I know. We still haven't decided what to do with, um, everything. He used to write songs. Or at least he told us he did. He refused to play for us, so who knows? He never played any for you? No, he di... he didn't. He... no. I'm sorry. Here it is. It's a... When Connor entered seventh grade, all of my girlfriends said, "here it comes, bar mitzvah season. He's gonna have a different party every Saturday." And Larry was so excited to take him shopping. He dragged him to Brooks brothers, and they picked out a suit, some shirts and this tie. He looked... just like his dad. He never got invited to a single party. He was such a sweet boy underneath it all. Everything just hurt too much. I thought that, uh, you could wear this to the memorial. For your speech. Oh, I'm not... i-i... I wasn't... I'm-I'm not speaking. Why not? Well, I... I just don't think, um... I mean, most people think that I'm... Not that cool of a person, so nobody wants to hear from me. Well, if... That's what most people think... It sounds like most people don't know you very well. They didn't know Connor either. They never bothered. You can tell them what they missed. You're so handsome. I'm so glad you changed your mind. Today is a day of remembrance and reflection. It sucks he isn't here to see this. The first person we'll hear from this morning is Evan Hansen. Uh, good morning, s... Holy shit. Sorry. Sorry. Good morning, students and faculty. I would like to say a few words to you today... About my friend... My best friend, Connor Murphy. Holy shit. I would like to tell you about the day that Connor and I went hiking behind the old Autumn smile apple orchard. We found a huge oak tree. Connor said that he wondered what the world would look like from all the way up there, so we decided to find out. We started climbing slowly. And then, when I finally looked back, we were already 30 feet off the ground. Um, Connor just looked at me... And smiled that way he always did. Um, and then... Sorry. Then I fell. I-I lay there on the ground and... Good morning, students and f-f... faculty. Sorry, that...

What's wrong? Everything you said in your speech. Everything you've done. You don't know how much... You've given all of us. My family. Me. No. No, I... You've given me my brother back. Welcome to the first official meeting of the Connor project. Right? Um, now, as you all know from Evan's speech, uh, Connor's favorite place in the entire world was the Autumn smile apple orchard. I am beyond excited to announce that, in addition to our support groups, we will be launching a kickstarter campaign to raise $100,000 to reopen and redesign Autumn smile as the Connor Murphy memorial orchard. Um, so to explain what we're going to be asking of you, I'm gonna turn things over to our director of global communications. Thanks, Alana. So great. Our new website is now live. If you have not yet read the emails between Evan and Connor... Oh, you're gonna want to grab some tissues. I swear, I've got a Cal Ripken here somewhere. Look at that, hmm? The entire '96 team. There's three hall of famers on there. - Wow. - You get the right people, baseball fans, uh, you could raise at least a few hundred bucks for the orchard, maybe a couple thousand. Yeah, but... I mean, you should, you should probably keep all this stuff. Oh, uh, it's just gonna sit here gathering dust. Uh, stiff as a board, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it's never been used. Connor... He loved baseball. When he was little. First time I met him, uh... Cynthia wasn't sure how the kids would react, all right? She was terrified. And I was terrified. I mean... Five minutes in... Connor's, like, pulling my arm, uh... "Come on, let's go play catch." He... I bought that... I don't know... Two years ago. I thought, you know, maybe we could... So stupid. He was really lucky to have a step... To have a dad like you. Your dad must feel pretty lucky to... Have a son like you. Yeah, he does. You know, I-I saw the strangest thing - on-on Facebook yesterday. - Really? Um, somebody had a video of you doing a speech. About that boy, Connor Murphy. How the two of you climbed a tree together at an orchard. You told me that you didn't know him, but in the speech, you said that he was your best friend. Right, well... 'Cause that wasn't true. When I said I didn't know him. I thought that you broke your arm at-at work. Okay, well, who do you think drove me to urgent care and-and waited there with me? You were at work. You remember? I couldn't even... you didn't, you didn't answer your phone. You-you told me that your boss took you. Well, so I lied, obviously. So when were you planning on telling me any of this? When would I tell you exactly? When are you even here? - I'm here now. - Okay. You know, I-I-I talked to Dr. Sherman, and he told me - you've been skipping appointments. - I missed one. You know those aren't free. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm so happy you had a friend, sweetheart. I'm sorry he's gone. I just wish I'd known. That speech you gave, it... I don't even know what to say. I'm... I'm proud of you. Thanks. Hi. This is a cool surprise. Can I get you anything or...? Just water. - Just water? You're sure? - Yeah. That's perfect. Coming up. Where's your mom? She works late on Fridays. Oh. I wanted to meet her. Yeah, that would've been great. What's this? Oh, it's just my mom is obsessed with these college scholarship essay contests. I mean, I'd-I'd-I'd have to win probably, like, all of them to actually pay for college, so... Your parents, they-they can't...? Uh, not really. I'm sorry. Is your room upstairs? Yeah. It's, um... Yeah. Yeah, so it's, like, a pretty standard sort of room, I guess. So... Hey. Oh, um... Actually, I meant to tell you this before. Um, so Alana and I had a really good... Um, we had a really good meeting this morning, and I think that... Y-You probably noticed, um, that, uh, you know, a lot of people were giving, uh, during that first week, which is definitely great, but, um, it sort of slowed down a bit, obviously. But Alana and I are really confident that it's gonna pick right back up. I think it's just a m... A matter of... Can I talk to you about something? Yes. The Connor project is... Awesome. It's-it's really, really cool. - Thank you. - It's just that, my whole life, everything has been about him. And maybe the two of us... Maybe we don't have to talk about my brother all the time. Maybe we can... Talk about other things. I like you. And it's not because you were friends with my brother or because of the Connor project. I like you 'cause...

I've been told that many times. Hi, honey. Come join us. - I just put dinner in the oven. - Hi. She made me swear to keep it a surprise. I'm surprised. Hi. It's so nice to finally meet you. - Oh, hi. - Hi. Yeah, uh, great. It's great. Come on, Evan. Sit. I-I thought that you were working tonight. Cynthia called and invited me for dinner, so, you know, I'm playing hooky. We were just discussing how sneaky you and Connor were. I had no idea that he and Connor were even friends. Oh, we were the same. You know, boys love their secrets. Something smells good. What's for dinner? Oh, it's chicken Milanese, your favorite. Oh, actually his favorite is my great-grandmother's black beans. Really? Well, he's the only one that appreciates my cooking, so... - That's not true. - Uh, another drop? Oh, no, no. I'm-I'm fine. Thank you. Oh, um, fascinating story about the wine. It's from a vineyard in Napa, and the entire growing process from start to finish, 100% sustainable. Is that right? Not to mention, it tastes good, too. - Mm-hmm. It does. - Mm. You know, I-I didn't realize, uh... Cynthia and Larry were telling me that you spend so much time here. Yeah, I... you've been working a lot, so... Why did I think you were at Jared's? I-I don't know. Evan was showing me all of those scholarship contests that you found. It's really impressive. Well, Evan is a great writer. Well, that does not surprise me at all. His English teacher last year told me that he wrote one of the best papers she'd ever read on Sulu. Is that right? - It's Sula. - What? You said "Sulu." It's Sula. Yeah, I believe Sulu's a character on Star Trek. My mistake. So, speaking of scholarships... Oh, right, uh... Yeah, well, I guess... Now's as good a time as any. Cynthia, do you want to...? Well, um... Zoe happened to mention that Evan was having some difficulty in terms of the financial burden of college. And Larry and I started thinking, and we've been fortunate enough to set some money aside for Connor. Um, I'm good. - I'm okay. - Yeah. Heidi, with your blessing, we would like to give Evan the money that we set aside for our son so he can fulfill his dreams. Thank you so much... But we're gonna be fine. I don't have a lot of money, but I-I do have some. No, no, no, no, no. I didn't mean to intimate... No, no, I understand, but, um, we do have money, so I'm sorry you were under the impression that we didn't. And whatever money we don't have, Evan will either make up for with a job or he'll get a scholarship. I don't want my son to get the idea that it's okay to rely on other people for favors. - Well, it's not a favor. - No. But as his mother, I need to set that example. You can't expect things from strangers. Oh, we're not strangers. No, of course not. But you're not family either. Mom, just hold on. No, I think I better get to work, see if I can grab a shift now that I know how concerned you are about our finances. Mom, will you please come back inside? Oh, my god. Are you kidding me? Will you just come back inside, please? They think you're their son, these people. They're not "these people." They don't really know you. Well, they like me. They like me. I know that that's very hard for you to believe, that they don't think I'm... You know, that there's something wrong with me, that I need to be, like, fixed, like you do. - When have I ever said that? - Oh, my god. Mom, I-I have to go to therapy, right? I have to take drugs. I have to... There's-there's nothing wrong with that. There-there's nothing wrong with needing help, honey. Just stop. I know that there is, and I know that I'm a burden, that I'm the worst thing that ever happened to you, and I just... well, I just ruined your life, okay?! No. You are the best thing. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. I'm sorry I can't give you anything more than that. It's not my fault if other people can. I'll see you at home. Hi. I'm so sorry. I meant to be there yesterday. Okay, well, we have two days left, and we're $25,000 short. Yeah, I just... everything... You're right. I know. I'm sorry. Things have been really busy, so... I've been wondering something. Were you ever actually friends with him? What are you talking about? Well, the thing about the emails, it's just that, like, you and Connor keep talking about climbing this tree together in June. We were in school in June. You didn't have a cast until September. Well, uh, you know what? We probably just wrote down the wrong date or something. It's not just the emails, Evan. You've missed, like, three meetings in a row. If I were his best friend, I would be doing everything I could to make sure his dream of rebuilding the orchard came true. Okay. Look, it's terrible that people aren't giving as much money as we hoped they would. It is, but-but it's not like it's him. You know what I mean? It's-it's just... It's an orchard, Alana. We have people watching us, hoping... Praying that we can prove Connor wrong. And if the orchard is just an empty promise, all of those people will know that Connor was right. That no one cares. Did you lie to me? Did I lie to all these people? Just go to your email. Another email? It's not... It's not another email. "Dear Evan Hansen..." If we weren't friends, then he wouldn't... He wouldn't have written his note to me. Look, only his family have seen this, okay? You can't, you can't show it to anybody else, okay? Alana. Okay. He wasn't right.

Wh-what's wrong? Yep. Hi. Alana, you have to take it down, okay? They've been through enough. I took it down already, Evan, but it-it doesn't matter because it's everywhere. Zoe, it's me. Please call me back, okay? I'm worried about you. They have pictures of us now. Just put it away. "His parents act like they are bereft, but where were they when their son was actually alive?" Please stop reading them. - Hey. Is Zoe here? - She went home. Things really aren't good here. I know. I just... I had to come. Where did they even... How did they get Connor's note? I don't know. Like, did they hack our computers? They hacked our emails? Did... these people are adults. Did you see their pictures? These people are adults. Look, maybe let it ring. I'm sick of hiding. Hello? Yeah, have-have fun with your miserable life. What did they say? What's the number? It's blocked. It doesn't... No, it doesn't matter. That's it. I'm calling the police. No, look, right now, maybe the best thing to do is to just stay calm, all right? - And sit... - That's always your solution, isn't it? Wait and see. Let's just wait and see, right, Larry? What are the police going to do? It's the Internet. Wh... Are they gonna arrest the Internet? I had to beg you, every step of the way, for-for therapy, for-for rehab. What? N-No, no. You went lurching from one miracle cure to the next... Oh, you're... really? Because all he needed was another $20,000 weekend yoga retreat. What was your alternative, other than picking apart everything that I did? How about putting him on one program and sticking to it? Remember what he said the first time that Connor tried to kill himself? - That he's just looking for attention. - For Christ's sake. He just wants attention! I'm not gonna sit here and defend myself! You couldn't understand him. You never understood him because he wasn't yours! Mom, what the hell? I raised him from the time he was three years old. He was getting better, and you refused to see it. Ask Evan. Tell them, Evan. Evan did everything that he could. Evan? Evan was in denial of what was happening. Do not bring him into this. Read the note, Larry. Read what he said. "I just wish that everything was different." I tried. - But he was my son! - He wanted to be better! - Please. I-I tried everything! Stop it! Just please stop! - Please stop fighting! - He was trying to be better! He was trying! And he was failing. We failed him. No, you didn't. No, you didn't. You didn't fail him. Read the note. He didn't write it. I wrote it. You didn't write Connor's suicide note. Um, it was an assignment from my therapist. Write a letter to yourself, um, a pep talk. "Evan Hansen, dear Evan Hansen, today's gonna be a good day. - "Here's why." - I-I don't, I don't think that... I was supposed to bring it to my appointment with me, but Connor took it, and then I guess he must have had it with him, um... When you found him, so... What are you saying? We weren't friends.

Two more weeks. When do you leave for college? Um, actually I decided to take a year off, so... Uh, just try to save some money. Get a job. Uh... take some time. So, I'm taking classes at the community college. I'll have credits to transfer in the fall, so... That's smart. Yeah. We'll see. I always picture you and Connor here. Even though... This is my first time. It's nice. Peaceful. My parents come here all the time. We do picnics, like, every weekend. Lots of gluten-free sandwiches. It's helped them a lot, actually. Having this. What I did... I can't even... It's the worst thing anyone can do. I wish we could have met now. Today. For the first time. Me, too. I should probably... Yeah. Yeah, of course. Of course. Hey, can I just... Can I just ask you... Why did you want to meet here? I wanted to be sure that you saw this. He really loved it here. Dear Evan Hansen... Today is gonna be a good day, and here's why. Because today, no matter what else, today at least you're you. No hiding, no lying. And that's... That's enough.
