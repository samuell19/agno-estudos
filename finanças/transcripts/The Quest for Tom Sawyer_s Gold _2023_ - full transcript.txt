"There comes a time in every rightly-constructed child's life when they have a fervent desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure." There it is. Okay, so what's the plan now? What does the line at the end of the book say? "The Widow Douglas invests in the gold which Tom and Huck found." So where'd they find it? McDougal's Cave. It's like a mile from the river. Guys, that was great. That will make for a perfect intro. Let's go again. Guys. Guys! "Sometimes the legend of some riches comes so heavily wrapped in folklore that you gotta scrape away the edges to work out what's honest to goodness and what's hogwash." Many o' folk have gone searchin' for Tom Sawyer's gold before, but most all have lacked the wit to match ol' Tom and Mr. Twain. Yeah, maybe Woody's right. We should go away and think up a plan. Yeah, like really put a good week's worth into planning it. All right. Please tell me that was your stomach. I was hoping it was yours. When I get to three, run into the cave. One, two... Three! Woody! This gold ol' Tom Sawyer found, pirate gold it was. And which Mr. Twain scribbled down about. Well, that treasure's as real as the day is long. Now, what fills me with such earthly confidence in the matter? Simple, 'cause my great-grandpa helped him hide it. These folks who go searching, well, the good ones find reward enough in the journey itself, but there was one who came close. Oh! Now, if you can believe it, folks used to know this one as about the bravest, most adventurous spirit this side of... well, anywhere. Agatha Armstrong, Aggy to you and me, came into this world with the single, most voracious thirst for adventure. Oh, yeah. There she is. Right there. The reptilian carnivore mississippiensis, better known as the American alligator. Okay. Couldn't have bothered you anymore. Oh, God. Go away! Go away! Hey, snappy! How about you pick on someone your own size? Ow! Get out of here, darling. Ha-ha! How do you like that, you scallywag! Picking on a little girl. I don't care if this is your swamp. - You can talk? - Hm! Hi. Eurydice B. Magillicuddy. However, you can call me Mrs. Mac. Thanks for saving me. I was almost like... A goner? Oh, all in a day's work! Now, where might one find a hearty bowl of calcium-rich liquid gold? It's funny the companions you pick up along life's road. Before long, they were the most famous feline and biped explorers in the entire universe. Well, entire world. That was until this young'un came along and something in Aggy changed. She went from the most devil-may-care adrenaline junkie to, well, a klutz. You're gonna be late again! Antony... And an overprotective one at that. It weren't his fault. Not really. If only they didn't make those little plastic building blocks so damned tasty to a two-year-old. Doctor told her to best keep a closer eye on him moving forward. And did she ever. Have yourself a day wherever you are. - Now, do you have your... - I'm gonna be late. Then you should have gotten up sooner. - Have you charged your phone in case there's an emergency? - Mom. - Yes. - It's better safe than sorry. - Yes, Mom. I'm gonna be late. - Okay. Drink. - What? What is this? - Just drink it. - I gotta go. - It's good for you. Gross. She still thinks I'm three years old. I'm being suffocated. Yeah, suffocated by your mom. Yeah, that'd suck. Dude, really? I'm baring my soul here. I mean, my mom never crossed the entire Arabian desert on nothing but a gallon of water. Just to get lost at sea for 75 days on an inflatable raft, fending off pirates at every turn. I'm just saying. Yeah, well, don't. Hey, Ant, come on. It's gonna be a boring party anyway. Mm, I love you, Miss Armstrong. Damn, what the... Good morning, sleeping beauty. Lay off me, Lennon. And here we have the rare beast, the galactus stare-a-sarus. - I'm sorry, I wasn't, um... - I'm just messing with you. Okay, you lot. Settle down. Sorry, I'm late. Traffic was a disaster. All right. Right, right, right. Good morning, class. Good morning, Miss Armstrong. Good morning, Antony's mom. Lennon, as we've previously discussed, in this room, I am Miss Armstrong. Perhaps you would like the hour in detention to reflect on that. Ooh! Oh, do you need a sweater? Are you cold? - No? - No. Stop it. Right, onto the fun stuff. This semester's book report. No. No, no, I think you'll really get a kick out of this one. Now, this particular book is written by a man who goes by the name of Samuel Clemens. Nah, Mark Twain wrote that. That's a pseudonym, his pen name. He named his pen? Like a stage name? Yeah, like Lennon's mom has at the zoo. Bobo, the... Ow! Do you want more detention? Yes, Lu, that's exactly right. And the reason he chose that name is because it was the call to the riverboat captains to let them know that the water was deep enough for them to travel through. "Land ho! Mark Twain, captain!" Uh, Miss Armstrong, are you sure we should be learning about this book? It has antiquated values. There's validity to that point. But the book can't be dismissed outright. Now, this offers us incredible insight into America's troubled past. This is really a parable on developing moral code through loyalty and friendship, all while showing kids how to have some damn fun. I want all of you to go treasure hunting. Okay. Through the pages of this wonderful book, and you tell me how you think Tom Sawyer and his friends would survive in our modern world. Okay? Pass that up. I've paired you off into groups of three. Hey, we're book report mates. Wow! Uh, I mean, uh, good. Great. Mr. Twain liked to say, "Never let your schooling interfere with your education." For, after all, the man who does not read books has no advantage over the man who cannot read them. If you have any questions, just come up and see me. Hey, you wanna hang out after class? - Yeah. - Cool. We can go over who will do what with the assignment. Oh, right. Yeah, of course. Cool. Sweet. See you. Hey, Ant, I'll be out in a minute, okay? Okay. Hey, Miss Armstrong. Oh, Woody, do you have a question about the assignment? No. Um, I, uh... I made you something. You... made me something, again. Um, that's very sweet. Oh, I-I was inspired by that story you told us about the time you were lost in the jungles of Malaysia. Right. Yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. Uh, that's very lovely. What is it? It-it lets you hear what animals are thinking. I-I figured since Mrs. Mac never leaves your side, it'd be cool to hear what she's thinking. See, you just press this button right here, and then... Voila! Maybe she just doesn't have a whole lot going on upstairs. But I will try again tonight when I get home. So, thank you. Bye, Miss Armstrong. Get this ridiculous thing off my head right now. And don't think I won't forget. "Maybe she doesn't have much going on upstairs." Some days I really think I should have just let that gator take you. Hush, you. Okay. Onto the matter at hand. Ah, yes. The interview. Are you ready? No. No, I, um, I'm freaking out about it. Come on, we did this last night. - What are you? - I'm a tiger. - I can't hear you. - I'm a tiger. And what does a tiger do? They devour their prey. And what are you going to do? I'm going to devour my prey. So let's get to it. Okay. I am a tiger. I'm a tiger. I'm perfect for this job. I'm the only person for this job. I'm gonna get this job. - Aggy. - Hi. - Thanks for coming. - Of course, Jenny. It's not every day that you get to interview for your dream job. Oh. Oh, I... I've come across too eager, haven't I? Oh, no, no, no, no. Um... Aggy, this is... This is just awkward. Uh... The head of the natural history position has, um, it's been filled. Oh. Oh. Um... Was it... was it something I did? No, no, no, no. I mean, you're one of our favorite teachers. It was sudden, you know? And I mean, honestly, I didn't even have much say. I've been practically training my entire life for this type of position. Oh, I know. I mean, we all love hearing all the stories of your youthful endeavors. It's just that, um... Well, someone applied that has a more, just slightly more recent résumé. - Really? - Yeah. Who? - Agatha. - AJ. Oh, wait. Oh, you two, you... you know each other. - We do. - We do. Yes. - Agatha used to be my... - Acquaintance. What are you doing in town? Well, the school was in need of a world-renowned explorer to head the natural history department, and, uh, I was in between gigs and thought, "What the hell?" Do you mind if Jenny and I talk? Ooh, no, no, no. Go right ahead. Oh, we're gonna sit. Okay. Oh! Yeah, of course. Bye. I am 100 times the scholar he is. You do realize that. I know. Listen, the school board notified us that due to rezoning, we now have too many schools in our district. And with cuts to funding, they now have to close one. And we're at the top of the list? - I mean... - Yes, yes, we are. I mean, it's been a rough few years. First COVID, and now this. And so we need something that will set us apart and elevate us in the eyes of the school board. But my résumé would run circles around his. But you haven't updated it in over a decade. Aggy, we need someone who is more of a risk-taker and can reinvigorate the kids' interest, and we feel like having AJ leading the history department will do that. Really? Him? Look, I'm sorry. Oh! I'm just... Oh, Mr. Harrison. Oh, you have my full support if you should even need it. And, you know, if you find yourself abandoned on the side of the road, just go ahead. Give me a call. Not! - You... - Aggy. We'll always have Morocco. Everyone thinks I'm a mommy's boy, even Lu. I don't think you're a mommy's boy. - Gee, thanks. - I gotta go. All right, I'll see you, man. Catch you on the flip side. Looky here. It's Mommy Armstrong's favorite student. And there's me, the least favorite. You know, you should think about paying the school rent, given how much you're in detention. Talking to me like that takes some guts. How about you say we take a closer look at 'em? Not today. You're dead meat, Armstrong! I'll be comin' for you. Okay. No, he's fine. He's fine. He's gonna be home. He's gonna be home. He's gonna be fine. Oh, my God. Ant. You're safe. You worried me. Where were you? Why didn't you call me? I'm 30 minutes late. Just chill. No, I won't chill. You worried me. Fine. I'm late because the bozo you gave detention to took it out on me. Okay. You don't have to shout. I do need to shout, Mom, because you don't listen. Why can't you just let me be a normal kid? I can't do this anymore. I can't live with her watching over me all the damn time. Well, if you ask me, no good can ever come from running away from home. Just see for yourself how that worked out for ol' Tom and my Grandpa Joe. But it sure does make for one hell of a story. Stupid books everywhere. "To whomever should find this... My father's story lives forever in the pages of Tom Sawyer." Come on, boys, we're owning them. Yeah! He ain't far. Come on. - Let's go! - Yeah! ♪ Dip to the moonlight Dip, dip ♪ ♪ Dip ♪ ♪ Three for you ♪ ♪ And five for me ♪ ♪ If flame or flood ♪ ♪ Bring harm on me ♪ ♪ I'll give you my five And take from you ♪ ♪ My three... ♪ Hand it over, Sawyer. What's in it for me if I do? - I'll let you live. - Yeah. You can work a double shift, digging me gold. That ain't no deal. I want in on. No! What do you want? Enough to set up my family. Let us live peaceably. The rest is yours. Ow. You idiot! Tom Sawyer. Tell your Aunt Polly, Angus sent you. What's so funny? That ain't the real map. Being rich isn't what all its cracked up to me. But then, you'll never find out. No! You idiots! Damn it! Okay. So, what's this thing that's so important, it couldn't have waited until tomorrow? - It was real. - What? "Mr. Twain recorded it most exactly as it occurred. The only thing he omitted was..." Where's the rest of it? No. It's just signed. Mary Sawyer, Hannibal, 1923. "Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred. One or two were experiences of my own. The rest, those of classmates of mine." Now, check this. "The real Tom Sawyer and Twain were friends in San Francisco. Twain told Sawyer, 'I'm going to write a book about a boy. Just such a boy as you must have been.'" The-the character's based on a real person. Plenty are. So what? So, if it's based on a real person, then maybe the events are based on real events, too. They discovered pirates' gold. Okay, $12,000 of it. - Is that all? - That was in 1876. With inflation, that's like two million dollars, give or take. Whoa. But... but do you guys think that this is actually some real-life journal of what actually happened? Listen, this could be, like, our one time to do something great. Like historically huge, and finally have people respect us. What if people find out? They'll fall over themselves laughing at us. They already laugh at us, Wood. For two million bucks, they can do whatever they like. Think of all the shiny, new inventing equipment you could snap up with that. I bet my mom would be mad impressed with us as well. Hmm. But where would we even start? - Uh, the letter said "Hannibal", right? - Yeah. That's the town Twain based St. Petersburg on. And it's just one county over. - Come on, man. Come on, Woody. - Come on, Woodster. Come on. I know, I can see it in your face. - Let's do it. - Woodster! Let's find Tom Sawyer's gold. - All right! - Yay! And that's what led to these young'uns being in this here predicament. Oh! Flashlight. All right. Everybody, keep your eyes peeled in case those wolves follow us in here. What are we even looking for? Right. The book said the treasure is two miles into the cave. Oh, look. There it is. What? Guys, we're gonna be billionaires. This is so much more than I imagined. Oh. Ant, what are you gonna do with your share? I'm gonna get my own TV and my own house. And probably a TV in each room. Maybe three. Why not four and five houses? Can you guys believe it was that easy? - Luxury suits you, Lu. - Whoa. Thank you. One does try. The hell are you kids doing in here? Uh, it-it's ours. Finders keepers. Okay, you can have this. Huh? Ugh. It's an amusement park? State park. And you're trespassing. I told you guys it wasn't real. Now, as I said, Tom and Mr. Twain would never have made it easy as pie for just anyone to find. Mr. Twain himself was just about as wise as four folks all smashed together himself. So it was gonna take about that many, at least, if anyone was ever gonna unravel the mystery of Tom's gold. Generation after generation has tried but failed, searching for our family fortune. Tch. Always coming up short. Until I, AJ Harrison, discovered that my protégé, a woman who I taught everything that I know, possesses the letter that's gonna give me everything that I want. Well... There ain't gonna be no stopping me this time. Lennon! What now, Uncle AJ? How would you like to become... really rich? Gotta give you points for adventurous spirit. Got a nephew about your age, can't get him off the computer, let alone travel in the dead of the night to hunt treasure. What's gonna happen to us? Well, last lot of kids who went looking for my great-great-grandpa's gold, ended up doing 20 to life in Leavenworth. Well, I think we can overlook the criminal charge this one time. Hm? So, wait, you said, "your great-great-grandpa's gold"? Indeed. Tom Sawyer. That handsome fellow on the left right there. What? He was my granddad's grandpa. Look, I don't blame you, kids. Plenty of folks from far and wide have gone searching for it. I took a shot at it myself once. So you think it's real, right? Hmm. Well, it's a wonderful tale to excite kids, but it's just that. A tale. Alrighty. Who's drawing the short straw and have me call their parents first? Yes? - Can you spare a moment? - Sure. Sit tight. You're gonna be all right. I told you, guys, we were gonna get in trouble, and... So you were real, Tom Sawyer. That's insane. The three amigos. "MDCCCLXV. I mean, I know it's not the Wi-Fi password, but, like, what is that? That's the year, 1865. They wasted a lot of space writing it like that, right? You guys, we've been going about this all wrong. Twain wouldn't make it so easy that the treasure is exactly where it's supposed to be. "Under the cross." We've been thinking about the cross like a crucifix. So what do you think it is? "Under the cross." You guys, Chapter X. It's the one in the tannery. You guys, this is our first hot lead. We can't just sit here and do nothing. What do you suggest we do? Just stroll on out of here? Uh... Hm. No. We go out the back door. Come on, hurry. Go! - The... But... - Shh! Go! Woody, let's go! Hah. And now we're fugitives. Be careful, you idiot. There's nothing but a bunch of junk up here. Look harder. It's gonna be leather-bound. It's gonna be yellowed, aged, stitched with a binder. It's gonna have lots of pages. I know what a book looks like, Uncle AJ. Lennon? Hello? Miss Armstrong? This is Detective Thatcher. Firstly, don't worry, they're fine. But you'll have to come to Hannibal to collect your son. My son? No, no, my son's in bed. No, actually, they went exploring. Something about an assignment you gave them? What? Hannibal? How did they even get that far? Okay. Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming. Oh, crap. I think these suckers beat us to the punch. Okay, get out of there. Abort mission. Get out of there. Okay, we'll see you soon. Yes, I will keep an eye on them. Great. - It's clear. - Um... Oh, the only one I found is the old Mitchell Tannery. It says it closed in 1984, though. - It's seven blocks away. - That's where we start. - Okay. - Let's go. What about a personal security guard to monitor him 24 hours a day? You should have taken that turn back there. Cat, I remember every single road, alley, underpass, and freeway I have ever been on. I know the way. When I get my hands on him... Well, for someone with a photographic memory, it seems to have slipped your mind what you were like at his age. My arms are getting tired. Here. "He picked up a clean pine shingle that laid in the moonlight. They buried the shingle close to the wall." Here. It can't be in here. It's got to be like an outside wall then, right? I saw some shovels coming in. Grab them quietly. Now, let's go. Let's get digging. - Ant! - Sorry. Detective Thatcher? I'm looking for Detective Thatcher. Hi. Hi. Uh, Agatha. Aggy. Antony's mom. Yes. So, uh, did you have a good drive? It was fine. Well, come with me. - I have a little update on the kids. - Oh, okay. What? I can't find anything. This is a waste of time. All night for... - nothing. - Wait. They said they found the treasure under the X. Under the X is Chapter Nine. Okay, so where are they in that chapter? It's the one in the graveyard. Come on. Guess we're going to a graveyard. I hate graveyards. ♪ Dip, dip, dip ♪ ♪ Three for you ♪ ♪ And five for me ♪ Is now really the time for karaoke? Sorry. Habit. I always do it when I'm worried. Thatcher, we've got a break in at the tannery. Three minors spotted. Over. Thatcher's responding. Let's just do this quick, okay? Tom said, "Huck, do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?" That's who we're looking for. Okay, then let's split up. Call out if you find something. - All right. - Okay. Come on out, guys. You're not in trouble. Antony! Freshly dug right here. This is his. Why is it here? They said something about an assignment you gave 'em. On Tom Sawyer. Wait. Tom and Huck buried a pine shingle at an old tannery after they witnessed a murder. Is there a graveyard nearby? Hannibal Graveyard. Oldest around. Then that's where they are. Let's go. Hey, come look. I mean, it's close. Do you think they're related? There must be some clues around here somewhere. Wait, the... That's weird. What... Whoa! Whoa! Woody! No! Whoa. - Huh? What the... - Ah! I think I'm ready to go home now. Sorry, Mary. I told you, guys, this was a dumb idea. You guys said, "Oh, we'll find treasure." All we've done is get arrested and find a skull. How am I gonna explain this to my mom? At least we tried. I just wanna go home. I... Dude, wait, really? Sorry. You too? Come on, guys, seriously? Hey, wait. It-it's a... It's a puzzle. Guys, we have to give this up. We're in enough trouble as it is. It's not Hoss Williams. It's "Who is... someone". Wait, letter mix. - Yeah. - Take the S, and put it in front of the A and the M. It's "Sam". And the other S makes "Sill". "Sam Sill"? It is real. So that's it. "Who is Sam Sill?" All right, let's go find Sam Sill then. Okay, let's go. Well, what do you know? They've gone and done what no one's ever done before. Solve the first riddle of ol' Tom's mystery. Guys, found him. Over here. - Sam Sill. - Nice, dude. Whoa! What... No way. - Is that the... - The map. Do you guys know what this means? It means you all are in huge trouble. - Hi, Miss Armstrong. - Hey, Mom. It would take the remainder of your teenage years to blueprint just how much trouble you lot are in. - But, Mom, we have to... - Antony Auggie Armstrong. You are so grounded that your clothes will be back in fashion by the time your punishment is even over. - Let's go. Now. - Detective, can you explain it to her? - Can you help us out? - Sorry, guys, I'd love to help. But as you ran out on me, it's time to face the music. - But, Mom, we... - Now, Antony. Miss Armstrong, we're so close. - Don't you get that it's real? - Seriously, we were so close. I knew it. Hey. Hey, Buttons. Yeah, I'm thinking of getting the band back together. You think you can pull another Alabama coat hanger for me? I cannot believe you would be so irresponsible, Antony. But we have proof that the gold and Tom Sawyer is real. Look, we found this map. No, that is just a worthless old scroll. You never believe me. Do you have any idea how many wild goose chases I've been sent on because of a stupid map? No. No, none of you have any clue how dangerous it can really be. How would I ever get to know? I mean, you took a job at my school to watch over me every second of the day. I did not. I like teaching. You hate teaching. You love adventure. I mean, at least you used to before you had me, before you scared Dad away. Now I have an overprotective mother and an absent father, and neither of us have fun ever. It's because I love you, okay? Then I'd hate to see how you'd be if you hated me. You dropped this, by the way. Why did you even take that? Because I was... going to find the gold and then run away to Utah to find Dad. Ant, your father... He's a door best left unopened. Well, he can't be any worse than you. He hates me. Ant just hates me. He just... He hates me. Your mom's really talking to herself. He's just hot under the collar. But I can't say I blame him. You know, you'll always catch more flies with honey than vinegar. Hm. Damn it. Ugh, I left the house in such a hurry, I forgot my purse. I need to borrow your debit card. I will pay you back when we get home. Thank you. He's proud of me. They say once you have that lust for adventure, it never... well, never truly dies. It lives on inside of you, dormant, waiting for that moment to snatch you back into it. It's a feeling almost as pervasive as a mother not wanting to let her son down. Almost. Oh, if... if we do this... You took me hostage, and we are back home in 24 hours. Okay? - Okay. All right, Mom. - Let's go! It's time I took the road less traveled again. All right, buckle up. It's gonna be a wild ride. Okay, seriously though, buckle up. Safety first. Everyone, act natural, pretend like I'm not even here. Ugh. Just put that away already. Stupid moths have eaten half of it. And half the words are missing. Nothing here makes sense. "Dip, dip, dip, if, nor, bring the..." The words are so small, I can't make it out. I may have just the thing. Aw, hey, kitty-cat. Do you wanna learn how to talky-talk like a person? - Oh, yes, you do. - Oh... - I'm gonna give it one more try. - Woody... - Let's see. - I wouldn't do that if I were you. What the... I-I didn't put that on yet. Oh, Mom. I guess the cat's out of the bag now. It would be a cataclysmic catastrophe to categorically succumb to the catalytically catatonic states of which you currently cater. - Huh? - I gotta get this. Oh, man, this scene could use a little more light. That's okay. We'll roll with it. I just want, like, a relaxed performance from everyone. Okay? And action. No, you're not filming me. I'm going back to my trailer. Why not? Hey, all this time and you never told me Mrs. Mac could talk? I-I'm... I guess there's one or two things I haven't quite told you about yet. And I'm assuming that's been here my entire life, too. Where's the spare tire? I don't know, man. - Okay. Get the map out. - Okay. "In Allister's Cove, the second shall be... Solve the puzzles there laid, and look within to see." It's only accessible through the bayou. It's about five miles down the road. Pack up the map. Woody, grab what you can from the kit. And, Lu? Keep filming. You got it. Okay, let's go. - Uh... - Hi. It's fine. - Hi. - Ah, car trouble? Oh, no. No, we're fine. We... It's just a pit stop, but we're moving along now, so... Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa there, Missy, uh... You can't stop on the side of the road. Not in this town. Oh, okay, I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't know what the rules in this district were, but it won't happen again. Oh, you wouldn't be on a treasure hunt now, would you? No. No, we're going home. - Kids? - The map. - Uh-huh. Map? - Uh... - What map? - Oh, hmm. Wise girl, huh? Hand it over now. - Mom. - Give it to him, give it to him. No, don't. Pick it up. I ain't playing, kid. - Run! - Go! - Go, go! - Go! Ugh! That's not mud! Run! Go! Go. Whoa. Where do we go? Where do we go? - Is he following us? - Keep going. This way. This way. Don't look back. Just keep going. Brats. Excellent work, my old pal. You just earned your 20 percent. - Hey, what about me? - Shut up, Lennon. A chance to get that turd back will sweeten the deal. Oh, you're gonna get it. And then some. It's in Allister's Cove. Allister's Cove. All right. That means we're gonna go up and around the bayou. Then let's move. Let's move. Hey, can you carry some, Uncle AJ? Lennon, I'm carrying the map. - Do you wanna be rich? - Yeah. You consider yourself an athlete? Then let's move. Okay. I think we're clear. - Oh, no. - Are you okay? Are you okay, bud? Sorry, guys, we... We lost the map. That's okay, because we have a budding filmmaker who got it all on tape. I was actually just getting you guys' close-up shots. I was gonna get a pickup shot of the map later. Well, that's that. We're done. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not gonna let that happen. Look, when I was your age, I was running all over the place chasing after all sorts of things. But you guys have gotten closer than anyone ever has with this. We're gonna see this through. We're gonna keep doing this, okay? But how? Hand me a pen and paper from the kit. An elephant never forgets. So either I'm part elephant or it's very fortuitous that you have a chaperone who has photographic memory. - No way. - Whoa. Whoa. And why didn't you tell me any of this? Must have slipped my mind. That's funny, Mom. Not. So you remember everything? Everything. Whoa. Okay. So it looks like we have to go through the river. It's a couple of miles down that way, so we got to keep going. - All right? - Let's go. Let's do this. I think we're going the right way. At least we're finally in the clear, right? Why did you have to say that out loud? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Get back. - Get back. - Get back. Get back. Get behind me. Shoo! Shoo! Why are they throwing rocks at me? So rude. It switched on. First, you come to steal my babies. Then you go throw rocks at me. Um, Miss Alligator, we're not trying to steal your babies. Good. You'd be in a lot more trouble. What brings you out this far? Um, we were looking for Allister's Cove, but we got lost. Allister's Cove is just down the river. Tell you what, as an apology for trying to eat you 25 years ago, why don't you take that rowboat over there? Look, I'm sorry about your eye. I wish I would have known all those years ago that you were... just trying to protect your family. Aw, don't mention it. Well, so long now. Y'all have a pleasant trip. My invention works. I knew it. I knew it. - Oh, yes. - Good job, Woody. Yeah, man. - All right, we gotta keep a move on. - That's great. Let's go. This way. Let's go. Okay. Now I feel like I'm in a Mark Twain novel. - Nah, we're in a movie. - Wow. Okay, the location of the next map is right over that ridge. Okay, let's go. Hurry. This way. That's my idea. I think it could work, but I'll think it out. "What's done on a dare yet comes in two pairs? How I'll spend mine, I know, but what will you get with your share?" Share. I got it. Okay. Huck asked Tom what would he do with his share of the loot. Chapter 25. Yeah, it's right here. Okay. "Tom said he'll buy these four things. A drum." Uh... Okay, the drum. "A sure-'nough sword." - Oh, over there. - Oh, there it is. "A red necktie." Uh, necktie. Got it. "And a bull!" - Whoa! - Whoa! Whoa! Wait! Wait, bull pup! Bull pup! - Bull pup! - Bull pup! Everyone okay? You okay? - Yeah. - I'm so sorry. Dude, will this riddle ever end? Oh. Woody, this looks like a task for you. Here. You know what we're gonna do at first light? Mm-hmm. - We're gonna track down those wannabes, - Mm-hmm. Those imposter treasure hunters, and then... it's all gonna be about fame and glory. Oh, and don't forget the gold. I almost... I almost forgot about the gold. Let's not forget the gold. Hey, Lennon. Are you having trouble pitching that tent? "Let's go treasure hunting," you said. "It'll be fun," you said. What is this? Are you not having fun? I just thought we could spend some uncle-nephew time. Maybe he don't want his share? Oh, yeah. I gotta get this. Yeah, it's a steamboat. How's a steamboat gonna help us find the next map? Um, maybe it'll float to where it is. Well, the map said, "Look within and you'll see." Whoa, I think these are coordinates. Oh. - Okay. - Um, longitude, 27.7676 degrees north. - Got it. - Latitude, uh, 82.6403 degrees west. West... Oh. Oh, that's... That's just right over here. - Oh! - Okay, come on. Let's go. - Come on. - Check it out. This is the spot. Yeah, it's supposed to be right here, but... Does it say anything else in there? Um... Wait. Oh! Found it. Uh, "Twain 0.12"? That cheeky bugger. - A twain... - Is a measurement of depth. You were paying attention. And 0.12 percent of a twain is about a foot and a half. Get the shovel out of my backpack. Hold this. Almost there. Come on, Woody. Wait. Whoa! Oh. The moths must have eaten it away like the other map. No, it needs to be aligned with the first map. Look. Oh, that-that's why the rhyme was so weird in the other one. Well, do you remember the other words? I do, but without it being perfectly lined up, it-it wouldn't make any sense. We need that first map back. I might have a stroke of luck for you. It appears you have some scallywags following you. They set up camp right outside my hidey-hole. Okay. Operation Treasure Map Rescue commence. Um... I'll come up with something snappier on the way. - That's true. - That was terrible. Please. So she was about five-foot-ten. She said her name was Margaret. There's the map, right next to the water cooler. Told you guys, bringing this would come in handy. Those filmmaking skills may have just saved the day. Okay, so here's what we're gonna do. Actually... Ant, what do you think we should do? Okay. Um... Lu, you're gonna sneak in to get the map. Copy that. Woody, you hide behind the tree and be ready to protect her, okay? Sir, yes, sir. Mom, you circle around that exit. - Roger that. - And I'm gonna distract them. - Everyone got it? - Got it. Right, then. Well, we're surrounded, and, uh, the whole tribe... Huh? What was that? Lennon, go check it out. You're dead, mama's boy! Nothing but net, Lennon. I'm gonna get you! The map is gone. The girl's got the map. Come here, you... I'm gonna get you! Ha-ha! Now you know why they call me Wood-y. AJ? Ugh, head of natural history. I should have known that you were behind this. Well, I am a treasure hunter, Agatha, and you should know not to get between a treasure hunter... and his gold. What are you gonna do, AJ, hurt me? Yeah, I am. You wouldn't dare. What makes you so sure? Well, let's face it. You've always been in love with me. Me, in love with you!? Wow, that is a big alligator! That is an alligator. And, uh, we're gonna put a pin in this for now. Buttons! Buttons! Thanks, Marielle. So how do you know him? I was his, uh, research assistant in college. Yeah, we explored the world together, and on our last exploration, he scammed me. So, um, we haven't seen each other since. Did you see him? - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay, let's take out the maps. Oh. - Line them up. - Here. Um, "Dip to the moonlight, dip, dip, dip. Three for you and five for me." A riddle? No, it's a song. And I know just where I've heard it. - Detective! - Detective Thatcher! - Is the detective in? - No, no, no, he's very busy. - He can't talk right now. - But we need to speak to him! What's the commotion about? You after Huck Finn's gold now, too? We made the decision to keep looking. Yeah, and we found these. When you line them up correctly, they spell out this rhyme. - That's the family song. - Mm-hmm. I remember you humming it in the car. - You do? - Mm-hmm. You'd make quite the detective, Miss Armstrong. Oh, you made quite the impression. Uh, you're singing. Uh, you're singing made quite the impression, - and that's why... - Mom. - The maps. Come on. - Right. It-it was an old family song. My grandmother sang it to my father, who sang it to me. Our family were coal miners, and our great-great-grandpa came up with it to get his spirits up when he was trapped down in a mine for four days - in the 1800s. - Mm. So it's hinting at being hidden somewhere deep underground. The nearest place is McDougal's Caves where we found you guys. Ugh. But we already looked there! Yeah, to no avail. Not with a Sawyer, you didn't. You're coming? - Yes! - Let's go! Let's find that gold! Whoo! Oh. Legend has it that more have entered than have returned. So, stay close, guys. Does that mean someone has died in here? No. Oh! Are you sure we should be doing this? Just... just stay together. It's okay, man. "Dip to the moonlight." Guys, uh, find a place in the roof where light can beam through. Right there. Great. Now, if we can "dip, dip, dip" - underneath these rocks... - Mm-hmm. We should be close, right here. And then it says, "Three for you and five for me." Paces, right? But where do we start? Um, we can... Oh. Maybe out that cross. Yeah. That's gotta be it, right? Okay, so, paces, right? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Three and five. One, two, three. One, two, three, four, five. Look above you. Anything? I don't know. - You got something? - Yeah, yeah, I think so. - Whoa! - Good. We found the map. - This is so cool. - Yeah. "If flood or fire should harm me..." "I take from you five and give you my three." "Take from you..." No. Take it all from you. I would like to thank the inventor of this, uh, ridiculous contraption. The GPS within helped us track you all the way here. Lennon. All right, phones out. Give them up. - No. - Just do it. - Out, out. Now. - It's not worth it. Give me. Ooh, XR-17. Nice. Thank you. And, of course... - You. - No. Oh. This is gonna take me all the way to the gold. You won't get far. Just watch me. Agatha, you've spent your whole life chasing history. Allow me to add you to it. Bye-bye now. - Back. Go. Go. Now! - Go to the back! Run! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa! I think we owe 'em a moment of respect. Agatha, you were a worthy foe, but, uh, you know, we all meet our makers someday, right? And, uh, furthermore, that's good. Let's go get rich. Oh, no. This is all my fault. What? No, Woody, you are not to blame for his greed. No. "And what does it amount to?" said Satan with his evil chuckle. Nothing at all. You always come out where you went in. Oh, for them to get this far to only have it snatched at their final hurdle, life sure is a kick in the guts sometimes. Someone will be here eventually. No, they won't. This is hopeless. And to think this is how it's all gonna end. And... and I never even got the chance to change the world with one of my inventions. I never got to win an Oscar. I never made the news catching criminals. Not even once. And I never... Oh, no, I've... I've really gotten to do pretty much everything there is to do, so, never mind. What about you, Ant? Uh, I... It's dumb. - Mm, come on. - It doesn't matter. Well... Listen, we just have to look on the bright side, okay? They're not gonna get very far without that torn piece from the letter. Wait. How do you know that the letter was torn? You told me that it was. Uh, no. I didn't tell you. Okay. Well, maybe this isn't my first time looking for Tom Sawyer's treasure. Oh, wait. Do you know what this means? No. Oh! What in the name of all that's holy? Hmm. You don't see that every... Oh! Come back here, you wee scully. That was a good burger, my friend. Whoa! - What? - That's ten types of illegal right there. We've been going in circles for hours. Do you not know how to read this map? Mm, no. Each map seems to point in a different direction. One goes here, one goes there, one goes nowhere. Wait a minute. There is a reason why the world's most renowned explorer, an anthropological... You're an anthropologist, Uncle AJ. Whatever. The secret hiding place to Tom Sawyer's gold is... - The Temperance Tavern. - The Temperance Tavern. T-this way! Oh, what in the dickens? Oh, no. The battery died. - Um... - Oh. That's Detective Thatcher's car. Meow. Meow. Meow... Okay, fine, I'm a talking cat. Yawnfest. Now, will you please go into those caves, follow their scent, and rescue my friends, who heavens to Betsy I fear may well be trapped down there? Let's go. And don't you dillydally. Thanks, guys. Call more reinforcements to secure the perimeter - at the final site. - Got it. - We'll meet you guys there. - Okay. Do we need to draw the map again? No, I know exactly where it is. Hey, um, you did a really good job in there. Oh, thank you. As a student of history, I have to ask myself what stories would these walls tell if they could speak. If you bothered to read the book, you'd already know the answer. Agatha, how did you... No matter. So, bringing your encyclopedic knowledge of literature to a gunfight, I see. It has perfect aim. Well, I will tell you this. I'm gonna fill you all full of new holes to breathe from if you don't tell us where that treasure is. The gold was never hidden in just one place. See, it was... always that last line in the riddle that really stumped me. "Take from you five and give you my three." Ant, what does Twain's opening passage in his book say? "Tom Sawyer is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture." So, what are you saying? Tom Sawyer wasn't real? Oh, no, he was real. But three made up this story. Miss Armstrong, yes, I've been expecting you. That gold belonged to just three men. Thomas Sawyer, Ben Rogers... And Joe Harper. My great-grandpappy. That ol' Tom Sawyer made a promise to not let that gold fall into Angus' hands. Just as I promised to never let it fall into yours. You were obsessive from the day we met about your family's fortune. So after you double-crossed me, I made it my goal to seek out every last detail to ensure you never found it. So I destroyed its final secret to always keep you at bay, and I've been carrying the remainder of that letter and the location of the gold in my head all of these years. Wait a minute, if you had all this information, why didn't you come for the treasure yourself? I tried. But not every stone needs to be turned, not every treasure pocketed. Well, Aggy... That's where we differ. See, the only thing that matters to me... Ant! You're gonna tell me where the gold is. The safety is on, you moron. Moron? Ah! I'll tell you this. I was the captain of my fencing team at college! Impressive. But so was I. - Get him, Miss Armstrong. - Come on! - Come on, Uncle AJ. - Let's go, Miss Armstrong. Come on, Uncle AJ! - Come on! - Come on, Miss Armstrong! Ah! - Miss Armstrong! - Be careful! It's too bad, Agatha. We could have been partners. It's a shame, isn't it? Don't hurt my mom! Do what you want. I might do something like this. No! What are you gonna say now, punk? Huh? - Mrs. Mac! - Enough. Don't! He's your son. He's my what? Morocco? Oh. And then you left me abandoned on the side of a cliff. I never wanted to speak to you again. Aggy, why didn't you tell me? Freeze! Aggy, why didn't you tell me? - Cuff him. - This is my son? Now I can see it. You're almost as good-looking as I am. You're under arrest. Kidnapping, attempted murder, assaulting a police officer, theft, destruction of public property. And I think you have a case with animal welfare. - Let's go. - Whatever, cop. I'll be out by morning. I love you, son! Aggy! We'll always have Morocco! Ant, are you okay? I don't even know, man. Goodbye, my old friend. Excuse me, who are you calling old? Don't play like that. - Mrs. Mac... - You're alive. Yes, well, I guess that's, hmm, five down, four to go. Well, you go rest. We'll be right back. Ah, time for a wee catnap. So long. I now know why you never told me about him. But what about this? It's... just a dime store novelty. I'm sorry, I just... I thought that the mystery of who he was being wrapped up in a trinket felt fitting for us. No, yeah, I-I get it. Really. I'm sorry. So... there's no gold? Oh, no, there's definitely gold. I just had to wait for the detective to bring his backup. Wait, so then where is it? Somewhere out in that yard are the final clues that the three men who inspired this very book left. Joe Harper, Ben Rogers, and Tom Sawyer himself. And if we find his three, then we'll find what "take from you five" means. So, let's go. - We're gonna find that gold. - Yeah. Hey, I found a "TS Loves MD". Okay, that's one. Where are you? Oh, I found the second. I found Ben Rogers. "Take from you five and give you my three." Okay. Take five paces towards the center. So we're standing on it? We're about to find out. Shovel. - Lu, can you grab mine? - Yeah. Now, if that don't prove the true meaning of teamwork, huh? Everyone giving their own special little part of themselves to help find it. Then they surely went and changed the meaning on me. Oh! - You hear that? - Hear that? Oh! We did it! - All right! - Wow! So much of it. This is so pretty. It's real. It's a shame we can't keep it. Wait, what? No, we found it, it's ours. No, he's right. It belongs to the Sawyers and the Harpers and the Rogers. I think there will be a generous finder's fee though. Seriously? Wait, what are we talking, like fifty-fifty? - We'll work something out. - Hm. After the shares were divvied out, they did what anyone with the right constitution would have done. Went right ahead and put it back . Most of it, anyway. All so the next generation of you thrill-seekers could track down the secret of that pirate gold for yourselves. I think great-great-grandpa Sawyer would be very proud. Yeah? And, you know, I think Mr. Twain would have approved too. Hm. At the end of the day, that's all he ever wanted. "A little more kindness, a little less speed. A little more giving, a little less greed. A little more smile, a little less frown. A little less kicking a man while he's down. A little more 'We', a little less 'I'. A little more laugh, a little less cry. A little more flowers on the pathway of life. And fewer on graves at the end of the strife."
