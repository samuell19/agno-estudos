I can't believe he's doing this. Charlie, are you really that surprised? I'm surprised Mary hasn't talked any sense into him. Danny doesn't have a job right now. That house is all they've got. Nothing is worth your life. [THUNDERCLAP] God, look at this flooding. So what's the plan? [THUNDERCLAP] We get them, we get out, or we're all dead. I mean, you can't play around with these things. I'm not gonna gamble with our lives. [THUNDERCLAP] We are currently urging all residents of Southern Mississippi and Louisiana to take shelter as soon as possible. If you have not already evacuated... May god be with you. [THUNDERCLAP] What happened? It's okay, honey. We need to get to a room with no windows. This thing's coming at us fast. Come on. Mom? It's okay, baby, come on. You need to stay here and take care of mom, okay? I'll be right back. Danny! Hey, Danny, open up! Danny, open the door! Danny, come on, open up! Danny! Who's out there? Danny, it's me, Charlie. Open the door. It's boarded up. Yeah, I can see that. Just open the damn door. All right, hold on a second. What the hell are you doing? I said we got to go. I'm gonna stay and hold down the fort. You're putting everybody in danger. The guys on the radio were saying this thing's already weakened to a cat three. We used to have parties in a cat three, remember that? I don't care. What if that's wrong? This is a sturdy house. Don't do this right now, Danny. Where are you gonna take us? Don't do this right now. Where are you gonna take us that's sturdier than this home? Think about your family. I am thinking about my family. Danny, can I talk to you for a second? Talk some sense into him. I'm trying! Please talk some sense into him, let's go. Baby, we talked about this. I told you I'd stay with you through hell or high water. You don't know how bad this is gonna get. And look at our daughter, Danny, please. Okay. All right, listen, Charlie. Take Victoria. Okay? But you got to swear to me you'll protect our little girl. Like she's my own. Go around to the side of the house. I'll drop down the rope ladder. Listen to me, Danny. Is there anything I can say to get you to change your mind? This is all we have. And I have to protect it. So come on. Shake my hand. I'll see you in the morning. How about that? Come here, man. I love you, man. I love you too. Mary, you take care of him. All right, we're fine. Let's go. Charlie, let's go. Victoria, come on. All right, we need to get up these stairs, let's go! Dad, where are we going? You're going with your uncle Charlie. What do you mean? I mean, it's time for us to go. I don't have time to discuss this. Dad, I don't want to go. I know you don't want to go. It's not up for discussion. Why are we doing this? We should stick together. Okay, we should all leave. We have so much here we need to protect. What about me? [SIGHS] Come on. That's why you're going with uncle Charlie. Listen, we got to get going, baby. Hold on. Hold on. Listen, we love you. All right? You're gonna be fine. And we're gonna be okay too. This is the key to the house I grew up in. When you wear this, you'll always be home with us. Okay? Please don't do this. You guys, please don't do this. Please don't go. No! You're gonna be fine, baby. Come here, love. It's gonna be okay. [CRYING] This is worse than anyone thought. The catastrophic storm has laid waste to New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf coast. Looting, crime, murders, and martial law have swept over our city. Homes being swept away, the streets are flooded. Hundreds are dead. Thousands are injured. Countless more remain missing. This is Michael Scott Shannon reporting. [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] [FAINT VOICES] [THUNDERCLAP] Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. Just, um... I just had a bad dream, that's all. Well, if you need anything, I'm here to help. Thanks, Julia. I know you are. I really appreciate it. I'll see you in the morning. How about that? You okay, honey? Yeah. Why? I don't know. You just seem a little tense. Campaign getting in your head? Oh, no. No, it's not that. It's that storm brewing down at pops' kind of has me on edge a little bit. Yeah. Me too. I figure maybe if I go on a run, I might be able to knock back a little stress. Sounds good. I'm gonna take a shower. I had a long day at work. Yeah, you deserve it, baby. I'll see you in a bit. I'll be back soon. All right.

Hoping they might postpone the beginning of school with the storm on the way and everything. Postpone school? It's gonna be a rainstorm in Mexico. What... what are you doing? Turning off the TV so you can do a little reading. Oh, that's what this is about? No, this is about school starting next week. I'll just cliff note it. No, you're not gonna cliff note it.

But it doesn't involve school. Really? Yeah. What's it involve? I'm gonna be a famous dj, travel around the world entertaining people. [LAUGHS] Great. My son, the traveling idiot. Look, Ethan. You know, you never talk to Victoria like that. I'm sorry, okay? When she wanted to run off and become a stupid little news reporter. Ethan, don't walk away from me. How is it any different from what I want? Besides the fact that it might embarrass you. That's not fair. Oh, I forgot. She's your perfect little niece. Look, it... You just don't treat her the same way. That's not the same. She's your perfect little niece. That's not fair. I know. That's not fair. Let's just talk about this for a second. Ethan! Don't walk away from me! Ethan! What was that all about? I'm just trying to get him to do his homework, that's all. Charlie. Oh. [WHIMPERS] Are you okay? Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Ethan. [GLASS BREAKING] Mom? Ethan. Mom. [CLEARS THROAT] [PHONE VIBRATING] Oh, my god. [GASPS] Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. [SIGHS] Okay. [SIGHS] What the heck happened? The gods have spoken. I'm sorry? Earthquake out in the Gulf. All right, what are we talking about here? 9.2 Richter measurements at the epicenter. That's impossible. That's hundreds of times greater than loma prieta. The whole top blew off of this one. Double the force of mount St. Helens. The explosive power of almost 1,000 atomic bombs went off in the Gulf this morning. Fortunately for all of us, it was deep underwater. The last time something even rumbled in the Gulf was 1957. You know, despite your encyclopedic knowledge of all things weather, Victoria, your maps are a little old-school, and you should think about upgrading. I like the feeling of the old charts. Okay. What is that? What is, um, what? What is that? Lava. They're saying it's a pretty massive flow, a gigantic amount pumping out from the earth's crust. Oh, boy, and it is spreading fast. Check it out. Temperature increase of 20 degrees per hour near the epicenter. How deep is that water where the fault line is? 100 meters. It's not deep enough to contain the spread. Nope. But the Tsunami warnings have been negligible. Okay, so no Tsunami warnings. What about Caroline? What about her? Where's the eye? Well, there isn't really an eye to this storm. It's more of a tropical depression. Just the coordinates, Pete, please. Okay, okay, okay. Just hang on a second, I... I got this. Um, the eye of the storm, if you could call it such, would be at about... 23.341 north by 92.128 west, more or less. Well, is it more or less? 5% margin of error. Good enough for me. You know, I'm surprised you don't still use an abacus. [CLEARS THROAT] What are you doing now, Magellan? We're all ears, Ms. Dupuis. Victoria, what's going on? Talk to us. Okay, um... Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The thermal readings indicate that the high temperatures in the troposphere are resulting from the lava heat. And in this case, those high temps and conditions could be reaching all the way into the stratosphere because of the co2. So that's gonna cause an enormous amount of atmospheric lift. And traveling at 20 kilometers an hour under the sea, that's gonna collide with our tropical depression somewhere around here. It's called a cyclogenesis. Common occurrence, just a rare cause in this case. So what? Pardon me if I'm wrong here. That wave of low pressure is gonna hit Caroline in only... 3 1/2 hours. And then what happens? Well, then things could get interesting. What do you mean, "interesting"? Unbelievable. Hey, Victoria. Victoria. Hey, Victoria. Victoria. Wait up. Victoria, where are you going? Victoria, hey. What are you doing? There's a chance that Caroline is gonna hit gulfport. I realized it just as we were talking. Okay. And? And my grandfather lives in gulfport, Pete, and he's too old and stubborn to leave. Even if a hurricane was coming, he wouldn't evacuate unless, I don't know, I was there to convince him. You heard professor brown. He said there's, like, a 1 in 50 chance that's gonna happen. I mean, the guy got a phd from Berkeley. He's kind of smart. I know, I just... I have a gut feeling about this one. You have a gut feeling? Mm-hmm. Yes. I mean, this could be our chance to really shine here, Pete. Think about it, Victoria dupuis and Pete Keller, ahead of the curve. I mean, we're never gonna make a name for ourselves by just sitting this one out. So what exactly are you talking about? Do you have the keys to the white monster? Oh, my god, no way. Come on! Don't even think about it. Come on, we're allowed to use it for school projects. Yeah, we're allowed to use it for projects here in Dallas. We're not even supposed to take it off of the campus. But this could be our shot. I mean, how many journalism students do you know who could say they shot footage from inside a hurricane? We can pick and choose our jobs the minute we get out of school. And plus we'd really be helping people. This is such a stupid idea. Fortune favors the bold, Pete. I mean, people's lives are at stake here. My family, when we went through this... I'm sorry, I can't do it. I'm here on scholarship. I've got way too much to lose. You're gonna have to call your grandfather and tell him what's going on. Sorry. I don't know what you want me to tell you. [SIGHS] Fire and molten lava spewing from an underwater earthquake. Uncle Charlie, I'm telling you, it's going to be really bad. You have to get ahold of him. Well, are you sure? I mean, how do you know? I know. I know it sounds crazy, but this thing is going to switch paths. I've never been so sure about anything. Well, at least you're in Texas, and you're safe, right? I know. Somebody needs to get ahold of him. Please let me know if you get ahold of him. Yeah. Okay. Love you, uncle Charlie. I love you too. Okay. Bye. What was that all about? Victoria seems to think that the storm is gonna change paths and possibly turn into a hurricane. Change paths to where? Maybe gulfport. But she's convinced it's gonna be pretty strong. No offense, but how could she possibly know that? I don't know, Ethan, maybe because she studies. Studying doesn't make her nostradamus. Ethan. I'm just saying, you'd think the professionals at a weather station might figure this out before a girl in college knows something. You know what, I've had enough from you. Thank you. Oh, okay. Look at where the hurricane is now. Can we at least give it until tomorrow before we start jumping to conclusions? You should listen to mom. She's smarter than you are. Ethan, that's enough. I'm out of here. [SIGHS] Babe, we all know Victoria can be a little overzealous sometimes. Wouldn't you agree? [SOFTLY] Yeah. You don't like being told no, do you? I don't like being prevented from doing what's necessary. This is far from necessary. Maybe to you. I spoke to professor brown. He thinks your numbers may be correct. Did he say we can use the Van? Not exactly. What does not exactly mean? It means that we're violating at least three student codes of conduct just by being in this garage right now. We could get expelled. Okay, well, you don't have to come with me. Just tell him you couldn't stop me. Victoria... I'm coming with. Thank you! Okay. You're doing the right thing. Yeah, I sure as hell hope so. And as you can see, there are multiple variations of the possible new paths this storm system could take. Nothing quite like this has ever happened, not since we've been able to track these storms with satellites. The underwater volcano eruption and subsequent heating of the water may create the perfect set of ingredients that tropical storm Caroline needs to increase in size and power over the next 12 hours. So today will be a historic one in terms of our understanding of hurricane science and, specifically, global thermodynamics. We'll all just have to wait to see what happens next as the day unfolds. I think I'd better call pops. Yeah, I think you should. Two of the possible paths look like they're headed straight for Mississippi. [PHONE RINGING] Honey? Come on, pops, pick up the phone. Is he not answering? [SIGHS] So typical. Maybe his phone got knocked out in the earthquake. No, no, he's just stubborn, that's all. He's a creature of habit. What do you want to do? [SIGHS] I got to go down there. Gulfport is six hours away. What would you do if it was your dad, babe? All right, go. Get pops out of there. Get back here as soon as possible. Maybe you'll be in a better mood then. I'll be in a better mood when my family starts taking these storms a little more seriously. You're not gonna get me a car? Fine. I'll just take yours, chas. See how you like it. Charlie, be safe. And call me from the road. Crap! ♪ When I was a little girl ♪ ♪ there were things my... ♪ Hey. Oh, thank you. There you go. So how we doing? It just strengthened to hurricane-force winds. Yeah? What's it clocking at? 78 and counting. [WHISTLES] Wow. Ladies and gentlemen, we got a storm brewing here. You okay? Yup. Yeah, I'm good. [SIGHS] I just hate to say I told you so. Yeah, well, when you're right, you're right. We should really get going, huh? I mean, this thing is not slowing down. Yeah, well, neither are we. Hang on. All right. Oh, I'm gonna stay back here and keep working, okay? Yeah, yeah. And drive safely, please. There are no seatbelts back here. Says the girl who is leading me into the eye of a hurricane. [ENGINE STARTS] [SIGHS] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Pops, it's your son. I'm pretty sure you don't need that gun that's in your hand right now. Come on in, smart-ass. [KNOCKING] Pops, I know you're here. It's me, Charlie. Of course it is. Nobody else leaves eight messages. How are you, Charlie? Do you ever answer your phone? No. Hey, Ethan. Ethan, buddy, are you okay? Ethan, open the door. All right, I'm coming in. Ethan, I made you dinner. Ethan? Charlie, pick up, pick up. There's a pretty good storm brewing, and it's headed right for gulfport. No, I heard the news last night at the bowling alley. They said it's just a tropical depression. Well, things have changed a little bit since the bowling alley, pop. This thing's gonna be serious. And it's headed here. Did you get up on the wrong side of the bed today? Pops, no, I didn't. But I did drive six hours to come see you, because you don't answer your phone. [PHONE RINGING] Oh, speaking of which. Hold on. Oh, it's Ellie. Hey, babe. Charlie, I can't find Ethan anywhere, he's gone. What? Charlie, what... what's going on? You're... you're kidding me. Oh! No, no, no! I got to call you back. I think I got him. Charlie. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey! Are you freaking kidding me? Huh? What are you doing? No, don't just stare at me. Get out of the car. How do you even know how to do this, huh? Oh, unbelievable, both of you. You teach my kid how to hot-wire a car? What's the matter with you? Everybody needs to know how to hot-wire a car. You never know when it's gonna come in handy. No, can we just go, please? There's a big storm bearing down on us. That's what I was trying to tell you inside, pops. I'm not leaving this house. No, you are leaving this house. It's not a discussion. Charlie, I know you still feel guilty about what happened to you and your brother. But it is what it is. He made that choice. I lost Danny because of a bad decision. I'm not about to let that happen again. Do you understand me? You can't keep doing this to yourself. I'm doing what I should've done a long time ago. Now let's go. Listen to me. I'm not leaving this house. [BIRDS SQUAWKING] Well, maybe. Wow. Yeah. Damn. Where are they all going? It's not where they're going. It's where they've been that I'd like to know. I got some boards out back. I want you to get them and help me board up those windows and doors, all right? Well, look at you, Mr. Changing my tune. Yeah, I'm changing my tune. Animals are a hell of a lot smarter than we are. Can we just board this place up quickly and get out of here, please? [SIGHS] This is quickly? [BIRDS SQUAWKING] Just make sure that's on. Yeah. Now it's good. Ready? Yup. Here goes. Okay, just got the first shot lined up. You look great. Okay. Thanks. You ready? Yeah. Okay. Rolling. [CLEARS THROAT] This is Victoria dupuis, live here on the ground in downtown gulfport, Mississippi. It's eight hours after the most violent underwater volcano in recorded history occurred in the Gulf of Mexico. Here in Mississippi, all eyes are on hurricane Caroline as she grows larger 100 miles south of the coast. Now whether she'll change course and head north has yet to be seen. But the entire coast is eagerly waiting for more information on the storm and the potentially devastating effects it could have on the local communities here. I personally lost my parents in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina. And I have wanted to bring early warnings to communities ever since that day and to be on the ground during the storm, to understand what they went through, and how we can be better prepared. We'll be reporting on this storm system throughout the day. This is Victoria dupuis, on the ground in gulfport, Mississippi, ahead of the curve. Cut. That was really good. Hey. Hey, come here. Come here. You were wonderful. What's wrong? I just... I just can't believe I'm back here right now. I'm so sorry I made you come here. This is so stupid. No, no, no, not at all. I-I wanted to come. I'm glad I'm here. Okay. [THUNDER RUMBLING] How long did you say it would take to get to your grandfather's from here? Um, I don't know, maybe a half hour. He lives right over the bridge. All right, well, we'd better get going if we want to get there in time. Yeah. Let's pack up. Okay. But I want to get this footage uploaded and online first. I think it's important that the rest of the world sees what's gonna happen here. By rest of the world, do you mean all 12 people who might be watching our tiny web show online? Yes, all 12 of them. All right, come on, toss me the mic. Does this tape... is it finished? Do I just push here? You know, just... Okay. Boom. Let's do this. We need to get out of here. Yeah, I know. I just want to get one more shot before we get to pops' house. All right, just tell me where to go. I'll do the driving. Okay. Deal. This is Victoria dupuis, live here on the ground in downtown gulfport, Mississippi. It's eight hours after the most violent underwater volcano in... You did it anyway. Why am I not surprised? Here in Mississippi, all eyes are on hurricane Caroline as she grows larger 100 miles south of the coast. Now whether she'll change course and head north has yet to be seen. But the entire coast is eagerly waiting for more information on the storm and the potentially devas... That's... that's good, yeah. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah? Hey, Scott. I got something I think you ought to take a look at. You still down there on the Gulf coast? Yeah, I got a lot going on right now. Is this important? What can I help you with? No, I know you're busy. It's a student of mine. Do you have a pen and a moment to take a look? Anyone have a pen? In an odd, related story, we've connected with a pair of students via their g4 Internet connection, streaming from an old college news Van. They drove all the way from Dallas, Texas to the beaches of Mississippi earlier today. A video they shot was used by meteorologists here at our station to confirm that the outer bands of the storm are actually closer than anyone thought. Here in Mississippi, all eyes are on hurricane Caroline... I can't believe they're airing this right now. This is so cool. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] Now whether she'll change course and head north has yet to be seen. But the entire coast is eagerly waiting for more information on the storm and the potentially devastating effects it could have on the local communities here. I personally lost my parents in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina. And I have wanted to bring early warnings to communities ever since that day and to be on the ground during the storm, to understand what they went through, and how we can be better prepared. [HORNS HONKING] [THUNDERCLAP] Here she comes. Guys! Guys! I'm almost done. One second. No, mom... mom is here. What are y'all still doing boarding up? We need to get out of here. Ellie, what are you doing here? The storm, I just heard on the radio. It's a category four now. It's an hour away. Pop, we're staring at a cat four. That's impossible. I just heard it on the radio. We got to find a safer place to go now. [THUNDERCLAP] [SIREN BLARING] It's a little late for that. Okay, everybody in the house now. No! No, we need to get out. Ellie, we'll talk about this inside. What about the plan to evacuate that you and I talked about? The storm is on us now! Charlie. Let's go, pops. They'll never take this house. Never. Okay, we rolling? Yeah. You got this? Yeah, the light's on. Yeah, okay. All right, come on. Let's do this. This is Victoria dupuis. This is my cameraman Pete Keller. We are back with you, deep inside hurricane Caroline. We are getting amazingly low barometric pressure readings. Winds are steady at 105 miles per hour. Our radars are registering anomalous propagations, which pretty much means that there is something big right outside the outer bands of this storm cell. The strength of this hurricane is truly incredible. The effective temperatures on ground level are boiling hot, the result of a fiery August portal. Our e.H.I. Levels are peaking at 3.5. That means the likelihood of downbursts are greatly increased. It's truly remarkable to think that not, like, what, 12 hours ago this was just a small tropical depression. Now all signs are showing that this is developing into a solid category five storm sys... We're actually in quite a... Quite a bit of danger right now. We're minutes away from moving our Van to a safer location away from the beach, where the winds are just getting more and more intense by the minute. This thing is really howling. We will be back with you every 20 minutes, reporting on this storm. Once again, this is Victoria dupuis and Pete Keller, ahead of the curve. All right. We got to get out of here. Okay. Let's do this. I'll get the camera. You okay? Yeah, I'm good, I'm good. You okay? All right. I'm gonna drive. Okay, okay. I'll stay back here. There's some readings that I want to jot down we can use later. All right. You were right. The e.H.I. Levels are completely off the chain. Victoria, be careful out there. [GARBLED AUDIO] I know! Just like a toy truck. I know. [TIRES SCREECHING] Pops, do you have to keep doing that? We're all terrified enough as it is. I'm not terrified. And charlie's the one freaking out. Ethan. All of you go ahead and be quiet for a minute, will you? You're giving me a headache. Pops. You hear that? That right there is the single best home security system known to man. Stop it. God. You got one of these? It's the universal language of fear. Are you finished? You ain't gonna find a safer place to ride out the storm than right here, right here in this home. You can count on it. Pops. Pops, I want you to think about what you're doing to us right now. [THUNDERCLAP] [CHUCKLES] Go sit down, baby. I know what I'm doing. Spooky outside, isn't it? Are you okay? How we doing up there? I can't see anything. I can't hold her! Just hold her steady. Try to keep it in the middle of the street. I'm trying to do that. The wind's blowing too hard. Victoria, what's going on out there? Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Victoria! [TIRES SCREECHING] [SCREAMS] 3.5. That means the likelihood of downbursts are greatly increased. It's truly remarkable to think that not, like, what, 12 hours ago, this was just a small tropical depression. Now all signs are showing that this is developing into a solid... Do you think they're gonna be okay? I don't know. There's got to be something else we can do to help. Julia, just about all we can do right now is pray. She's gonna make it through this. I know, but there's got to be something else we can do. This is Victoria dupuis and Pete Keller, ahead of the curve. If you won't say anything, I will. What do you want me to say? He's not gonna move. That's your answer? No, that's his answer. All right. Pops... enough is enough. I'm at my wits' end here. [LAUGHS] I can see that. We are all gonna drown if we stay here. And I cannot let that happen to my family. This house is gonna end up on the other side of the highway when it's all said and done, and you know that. I built this house. It's sturdy as a brick. [THUNDERCLAP] [SIGHS] Nobody freak out. Charlie, there's a lantern by the fireplace. It isn't safe here. Listen to your grandson if you won't listen to me. Do you really want to put us through this? You know we would never leave here without you. We'd never leave you alone. And you are putting us all in danger. Really? Pops, please. You need something, little man? Come on, pops. Why can't you just listen to them? We can't separate now, and we're not leaving you, okay? So just listen to us. I'm begging you. Sit down! All right. You did good, little man, speaking up. Tell you what, we'll find some higher ground. The last thing I want to do is see you guys hurt on account of me. [SIGHS] Okay, thanks. Ethan, you heard your grandpa. Come on. We're leaving. Let's go. How far away are we? Well, if that damn bridge didn't get taken out, we would've been there an hour ago. It just ripped in half. I've never seen anything like that. Yeah. And if my son would start driving like a man, we'll be there in 20 minutes. Seriously, pops? I can barely see as it is. Charlie, watch out! [TIRES SCREECHING] Is everybody okay? Yeah. Yeah, we're okay. You think there's anybody in there? Only one way to find out. We got to get out of this vehicle now. All right. Hey! Anybody in here? Anybody in here? Ethan, don't go out there. Is there a door down there? I'll go check it. Okay, stay here. Be careful. Hey, is anyone in there? Hello? Anybody in there? Open up. Look out, look out. Stand back. Ellie, be careful. Come on, mom. Hurry up. Come on, pops. Hey, anybody in here? No! Jesus. Get back, get back! You shot my dad. Yeah, and I'll shoot you too! No looters. There ain't nothing here for you. We're not looters. We were stranded in the hurricane. Hold still, pops, okay? Don't move. Shut up! Everybody just shut up. Come out with your hands up, slow. Slow. I said slow. Who are you? I got nothing. Who are you? What are you doing here? We needed to find some higher ground, okay? We ended up here. Look, man, my son's trapped under that beam. Can you help me? Yes or no. I can help you. I'm a doctor. But you have to let me check him out first. Who did I hit? Me, you son of a... pops. Pops? Put the gun down, okay? Put the gun down. What are you doing, walking in here with a shotgun? What do you expect me to do? I expected you to fire a warning shot. That was a warning shot. Ellie, help the kid. I've been through a lot worse than this. Would you hush and let me take care of you? It's just a sissy nine millimeter. I'm lucky it wasn't a .45. Ellie, just take care of him, all right? My son is hurt. Please, hurry. Ellie, help the kid now. It's just a scratch. It is not a scratch. I got this, pops. Just let her help you. Show me where your kid is. Right over here, man. Okay. Damn. Do you think we could even lift this thing up together? I don't know what we're gonna do, but we need to get this off of him now. Okay, okay, okay. It's probably gonna be a lot heavier than you think. Ellie, I need you over here now. I'm coming. Ellie, help the kid. All right, Ethan, look. I need you to come over here, and I want you to apply pressure to his wound, okay? A lot of pressure, as hard as you can press. There's gonna be a lot of blood. But it went through, and it didn't hit any vital organs. All right? Yeah, I'm okay. You are lucky. You're the luckiest son of a bitch I know. Yeah. Yeah. Listen, do you think we could lift this thing up and move him out without hurting him any more? [THUNDERCLAP] Yeah. I just hope the whole thing doesn't come down. You're okay, kiddo. I should be telling you that right now. Yeah, but then you'd be lying. You know something, you've turned into a fine young man. You look at your dad, everything he does, everything he's doing. That's a hero. We need to hurry. He's been breathing kind of funny. He's probably got a few broken ribs. What's your name? Joanna. Okay, Joanna, what I need you to do is grab him by the belt loop, okay? Okay. When I say go, we're gonna pull him out of here in one clean movement. And on my count. Ready? One... Two... Three. [ALL GRUNTING] Good job. Good job, buddy, okay? You're doing a great job. Joanna. Yes. Joanna, it's gonna be fine, all right, it's gonna be fine. Okay. A day like today, that's what separates the men from the boys. You're a man now. In my book, anyway. And I'm damn proud of you. I'm just doing what I can do to help. Yeah, just keep it up. I'm gonna go check on pops. Joanna, everything's gonna be fine. Do you have a first aid kit? Yes. Yeah? Go get it. Okay. Okay, make sure there's lots of tape and bandages. Okay, okay. You're doing good, sweetie. You're gonna be great. Okay, you're doing a great job, buddy. Does it hurt to breathe? Mm-hmm. Yeah. We're gonna fix that. That's right, buddy. She's gonna take care of you, I promise. We love you. You're gonna be fine. And we're gonna be okay too. [ECHOING] We love you. Pete? Pete. Pete! Pete. [GRUNTS] Pete. Pete! Pete? [SIGHS] It's been over an hour since her last broadcast. They said they were gonna update it every 20 minutes. They might not be able to get a signal out there. I hope so. It's gonna be okay. [COUGHING] How you doing, old man? I've been better. Yeah. That kid's in bad shape too. Look, as soon as ellie's done over there, she's gonna come over here and try to doctor you up a little bit, all right? Yeah. Think they got something to drink around here? Pops, we're in a bar. I'm sure there's stuff to drink. But you don't need that right now. It's just gonna make you bleed more. Yeah, but it would make me feel better. [LAUGHTER] Yeah. All right, I'll work on that. She's gonna take care of you. She's gonna take care of you. Okay, okay. Great. All right, this is great. This is gonna hurt. It's gonna hurt a lot at first. But when we get done, you're gonna feel a lot better, okay? In the meantime, what I need you to do, buddy, is stay real still, okay? I need some high-proof alcohol. Do you have that? Yeah. All right. Look at me. I haven't told you this in a long time, but I really love you. Well... This is a hell of a time. [LAUGHTER] When we get out of here... [THUNDERCLAP] Charlie, we need to get out of here. Is there a room in here with no windows? You guys, go. The kitchen's that way. Go! All right, pops, we got to get out of here. Ethan, grab pops. Let's go. Let's go, come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go. [CRASHING, GLASS BREAKING] Get up, get up, get up! Yeah. Absolutely. She was in my class just yesterday afternoon. She had some crazy ideas about the storm, which actually came true. And then she just left. Hold on a second. When's the last time you saw her? Yesterday, around 11:00 A.M. She came to our room and said she needed to go warn her grandfather, that he may be in danger. I guess her grandfather lives down there or something. Her roommate is here right now, so why don't you just ask her the questions? Okay. Hello. Yes. Yes, her grandfather lives down there. She lost her parents in Katrina, and she couldn't stand to lose them too. I don't care about all that. Somebody needs to get down there to check on them now. Hello? Hello? We've just received a new video from the two university students trapped deep inside hurricane Caroline. Hey, wake up. Everybody, wake up. It's Victoria. This is Victoria dupuis. [GROANS] This is more of an s.O.S. Message than an official report. We are deep inside hurricane Caroline. As you can see, my cameraman, Pete, is... is unconscious, and we really need some help. So, anyone that's out there, please, we are at bay St. Louis bridge and highway 98. This is well beyond a category five storm as we speak. Winds are probably about 200 miles per hour. Um, uncle Charlie, aunt Ellie, Ethan, and pops... Just know that I was doing what I really love the most when things went... i'm so sorry. [CRYING] Hey. We're gonna get you over here in this chair. [GROANS] Ethan, shut the door. Okay, okay. Sit you down right here, okay? Yeah. Just get down, don't move. Hey! Just stay here, okay? Just rest for me. Hey, my husband's out there. Ricky! It's all right. He's all right. Hey, hey, hey. Ricky, Ricky. Stop. It's too dangerous out there. Okay, just stop. Ricky, Ricky. Stop, stop. Listen to me. Listen to me, stay calm. It's too dangerous to go out there right now, okay? Your son needs you. Stay with your son. Joanna, he needs you to be strong. Your son is stable right now, but you need to watch him carefully so that we can take him to the hospital when all of this blows over. Listen to me. We're gonna get through this together, all right? Just stay calm. Get me that bottle over there, huh? Pops, I need to dress that wound now, okay? [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] Go easy on that, pops, okay? Damn. It's really howling out there. Is there a radio? Yeah, over there. Over there. Ow. Sorry, pops. Right there. We got to try to get this thing cranked up. [STATIC, FREQUENCIES SWEEPING] Is it over? No. Unless we're in the middle of it. Is it enough time to take my son to the hospital? No, the bridge was knocked out. We're not going anywhere till the rescue units get here. [RADIO RECEIVING SIGNAL] Guys, I've got something. They've allowed their last transmission to come through, and we just received this disturbing report from our two heroic amateur reporters, deep in the eye of hurricane Caroline. This is more of an s.O.S. Message than an official report. We are deep inside hurricane Caroline. I know that voice. Wait, is... is that Victoria? Is unconscious. And we really need some help. So, anyone that's out there, please, we are at bay St. Louis bridge and highway 98. Why isn't she in Dallas? This is well beyond a category five storm as we speak. Winds are probably about 200 miles per hour. Um, uncle Charlie, aunt Ellie, Ethan, and pops, just know that I was doing what I really love the most when... i'm so sorry. [SIGNAL INTERFERENCE] She's not even ten minutes down the road. Look, we don't have any time, pops. Where is that exactly? You just go down the main road till you get to the bridge. She's right there, follow the main drag, quarter of a mile. Right there, you can't miss it. Thanks. Wait. Charlie, what are you doing? I'm going to get Victoria. No. What do you want me to do, leave her there? It's my brother's daughter. I promised I'd keep her safe. Dad, I'm coming with you. Ethan, no! No, what if he needs my help? What if victoria's in more trouble than we think she is? We don't know what's out there. Listen to me. We're in the middle of this thing right now. It's gonna be okay, all right? It's calm. I don't have much time, but I am going. Charlie. You be careful. And come back. It's gonna be okay. Hey... we're coming back. We're getting Victoria. We'll be right back. Please find my husband. We don't have much time, son. This thing's coming back. [PHONE RINGING] Aunt Ellie? Victoria? Oh, my god. I can't believe I got through. Are you okay? Are you safe? Um... Yeah. It's pretty bad out here. I know, sweetie. We heard you on the radio. Charlie and Ethan are on their way to get you right now. Well... I don't hear any wind. Are we in the eye? Yeah. It probably means we've got about a 20-minute window. Are you with anybody? Are they safe? Yeah, I'm with my friend Pete. He's unconscious. What should I do? Did he get hit on the head? Yeah. Yeah. What should I do? Okay, listen. You need to keep his head elevated, okay, sweetie? And you need to watch his breathing. Yeah. If he stops breathing, you need to perform cpr, okay? Like I taught you. Remember? Yeah. Yeah. You need to be there for him right now, sweetheart. You need to stay strong, okay? Okay. Like your mama was there for your daddy that night. [GIGGLING] [SOBBING] I love you. I miss them so much. I know you do, sweetheart. I know you do. I just wish that they were here with me right now. Maybe they are. I can remember the day that your daddy met your mama like it was yesterday. He was so excited. He was sure that he'd finally met the one. And he'd known her for about two days. He said to me, "Ellie, I would move mountains for this woman. I would fight an army of men all by myself just to keep her safe." And then when you arrived, he told me the exact same thing. [SOBBING] Just like what you're doing right now. Where are you? Victoria. Aunt Ellie. [THUNDERCLAP] Aunt Ellie. [SOBBING] We've had no transmission from our two brave student reporters on the ground near gulfport, Mississippi, leaving some to speculate whether Victoria dupuis and Pete Keller are now alive, dead, or in serious peril. As the strong backside of this category five storm system passes over gulfport and makes its way north, our thoughts and our prayers go out to all the residents of those regions as this super storm makes its way north, leaving a wake of unprecedented destruction behind it. The national guard is standing by for an immediate search-and-rescue operation as soon as the winds are safe for helicopter travel. Please stay tuned for more up-to-the-minute coverage of this terrifying event as the story unfolds. Victoria! We're in here. I'm right here. Uncle Charlie, I'm right here. Victoria, are you okay? Come on. Back here, back here. Charlie. Hold that up. Is he hurt? Yes. He's hurt. Be careful. I don't know how bad. Okay. Let's get him out of here. Are you all right? I'm okay. We need to get out of here now. Open the door. Okay, okay. [THUNDERCLAP] [THUNDERCLAP] Please wake up, Pete. Pete, wake up. Please don't do this to me. Pete. Wake up, Pete. Pete, please wake up. [MOANING] Oh, my god. Oh, my god, he's awake. Oh, my god. Where am I, where am I? Pete, you're okay. [MUMBLING] It's okay. Pete, I got you. We're in my uncle's car, all right? We're gonna be okay, all right? I was having the weirdest dream. We were on a date. You took me to a planetarium. [LAUGHS] We were laying there, looking up at the stars. And you kissed me. Oh, really? [LAUGHTER] Yeah. That sounds really nice. It was really nice. I'm really happy I came with you. [LAUGHS] I think that injury's really going to your head. Just hang on, kids. We're almost there. Thanks. [THUNDERCLAP] They should've been here by now. Have faith, Ellie. They'll be here. Something's gone wrong. I just know that something's gone wrong. [DOOR OPENING] Charlie? Oh, god. Oh, god. You okay? Yeah. I told you we'd come back. How did they get you out of the house? [CHUCKLES] It wasn't easy, baby. But everything's all right now. We're all together. And that's all that matters. Yes, sir. I'm so sorry. We looked everywhere, but we couldn't find him. [CRYING] We did everything we could. I'm so, so sorry. [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] Hi. Hi. Are you okay? Yeah. You okay? I'm good. 'Cause you look good. [LAUGHTER] Thanks. How do I look? You look good. Yeah? Yeah. Are you just saying that? [CHUCKLES] So planetarium, huh? Yeah, about that... Roger that. Victor Charlie one returning for fuel stop. [HELICOPTER APPROACHING] Do you hear that? Hear what? Do you hear that? Ellie, wake up. Wake up. It's a helicopter. It's a helicopter. Come on, come on. Joanna, how do we get out of here? How do we get on the rooftop? Over there. Okay, everybody, let's go now... to the roof! Let's go. Come on. All right, here we go, kids. All right, all right. Let's go. [GROANS] We haven't begun to investigate the hundreds of compelling stories out there, but today we have a unique one. You know her as Victoria dupuis, ahead of the curve. I'm so proud of you, sweetheart. You're so brave. Your mama would be so proud. All right, it's your moment to shine. You tell them your story. All right. But as it turns out, there was a lot more to her harrowing story than even we knew. Victoria, why don't you tell us about the strange and unique circumstances that brought you and cameraman Pete Keller down to gulfport from Dallas to cover this terrifying perfect storm and the risks you took to get here. Thanks, Ken. This is Victoria dupuis, here on the ground in gulfport, Mississippi. That's usually my line. But, no, I think you're getting the hang of it. [LAUGHS] Okay. Nicely done. Trying to. Thanks. Well, it's really a crazy story. I don't even know where to begin. But, first of all, I think it's important to tell everyone at home that the horror is far from over here. It will take years to repair. And there are countless other issues that need to be addressed, even as we speak. But I think the most important thing is the spirit of hope that's felt by each and every one of us here... a spirit that can't be squashed... and we will keep fighting. But we need your help. We knew about a day and a half before it hit it was gonna be a cataclysmic event. Most of the people that wanted to stay said, "oh, I was safe here in Camille. And we had no water. So I'm gonna be great." We thought a hurricane was coming. We said, "let's, you know, get a couple bottles of Tequila and have a hurricane party." That's what we do in Mississippi, you know. I think that's what a lot of people do. We were gonna have fun. And then we were gonna go back to work and do our thing. It... It didn't happen that way. I got a call from the intergovernmental affairs office at the white house that said, "what's your opinion as to where you all are from a vulnerability standpoint?" And I said, "well, the best I can tell you is that I believe you can just write us off." The house was shaking. The roof was tearing. And the house was taking on water and no electricity. And I couldn't go anywhere, because I was stuck. When I answered the telephone and someone told me they were on a roof, and they were pregnant, and they had children, and could I come get them, could I help them? It was just horrific. As a matter of fact, after the storm, we had to go, you know, and offer assistance to the dispatchers that took those 911 calls. Most hurricanes are 2, 2 1/2 hours, and they go on through. This one just stayed for nine to ten hours. And you couldn't tell when it started, when it'd end, 'cause it was so long. Honestly, I thought it was over. I thought I was done. I didn't know if my family was alive, if I had a home anymore. And, you know, I got lucky. The house made it through. The structure of the house made it through. The house was destroyed. The town was destroyed. We went from the 21st century to the 18th century in nine hours that day. That's how much devastation we had. I had seen so many "after the hurricane" walks that I thought I knew what I would expect. Typically, the trees are stripped of all the leaves, and there's, you know, debris and shingles and stuff, like, everywhere. So I said, "you know, that'll be what we'll see." And it was just beyond that. We have a duty to protect our citizens, the people in our community. And when we do that, we put our lives on the line. But we try to make our families safe before we do it. All of the funeral homes were destroyed. And there was no water. So we would pack bodies in body bags and then put them in refrigerator trucks till there would be a funeral. And I asked him about my family. And he said, "I don't know. We haven't heard from them." A lot of people died. A lot of people were hurt. A lot of people lost everything. It was terrible. But it was also the kind of thing that, as a community, we said, "you know, we're gonna survive this. If it doesn't kill us, we are going to survive." He told me to turn around. And I looked at him kind of funny, like, "what are you talking about?" And he said, "turn around." And when I did, my wife and daughter and her boyfriend were walking across the street. And then I knew everything was gonna be okay at that point.
