Our earliest experiences being in the womb form the template of who we believe we are, about how we see other people, and our place in the world. When I see human faces, I see beauty, I see tremendous suffering and enormous potential for transcendence. A Greek playwright wrote that the Gods created us human beings so that we have to suffer into truth. Our job as human beings is to learn from our suffering. We don't have to keep perpetuating pain for ourselves and inflicting suffering onto others. In working with so many other people, I've learned that working through trauma can teach us so much wisdom and can reveal the beauty of our existence, that because of trauma, you had lost sight of. My name is Gabor Mate and I'm a retired medical doctor and these days I travel the world speaking and teaching about child development, health, illness, stress and trauma. And speaking about trauma is really part of the zeitgeist these days. And I'm very passionate about it for a simple reason: because in 30 years or more of medical practice and of addiction medicine, what I found was that the common template for virtually all afflictions, mental illness, physical disease is in fact trauma. And there's a wisdom in trauma when we realize that our traumatic responses and imprints are not ourselves and that we can work them through and thus become ourselves. Virtually every week there's a study that more and more people are needing or seeking help for mental health issues. More and more youth are diagnosed with anxiety, many more kids are diagnosed with the whole plethora of childhood conditions, such as ADHD, (Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder). Depression is rising, youth suicide is rising, addictions are rising. Genuinely, it's an epidemic. 20% of youth or more are now diagnosable with anxiety according to all the recent studies. That's one-fifth. And those are all only people who are sufficiently anxious to be diagnosed. We're talking about an epidemic. - When you grew up in a circumstance like I grew up, you're waiting for somebody to scream at you, you're waiting for something to be thrown, you don't know if you're going to eat, you don't know if you're going to be evicted. So you're constantly anxious and stressed. I used to think this was a rarity but when I talked to people, a huge number of people have these traumatic experiences as a child that carry, they carry with them. It's like a monkey on your back. - Trauma is an overwhelming threat that you don't how to deal with. So trauma is not the bad things that happen to you, but what happens inside you as a result of what happens to you. - My father was shot and killed on December 25th, 1999. They found his body in someone's front yard. So essentially I didn't have anybody to raise me. So I was raised in the juvenile court system. I've lived on the streets since I was 10-years-old by myself. The law didn't scare me. I mean, they could have locked me up, I mean what's the difference? Nobody out here is gonna miss me. - My mother, alcoholic. Bad alcoholic. My father, sex addiction. His sex addiction ruined our whole family. Cheating. Caused divorce. I started heroin at 26. That's what really destroyed me. It just takes the pain away. I tried building my dream so many times. I don't really have a dream no more. - So trauma fundamentally means a disconnection from self. Why do we get disconnected? Because it's too painful to be ourselves. That then becomes a lifelong dynamic. I no longer know how to deal with emotions. It means that in relationships when I feel a bit hurt, I immediately withdraw so I don't have to feel those emotions that I don't know what to do with. So there's a disconnect. It also means that when I have a gut feelings, I don't follow them. So I create situations of risk for myself. The trauma also affects how our brains develop. Certain key brain circuits that have to do with how we react and respond and regulate ourselves, how we handle stress, how we interact with other people, how much empathy and insight we have, how much compassion we have. These functions of the mid-frontal cortex are limited and constricted by trauma because we now know that the brain develops in interaction with the environment. So the brains of traumatized children don't look like the brains of non-traumatized children. - You can take it, please. - I've had enough of your crap. You're gonna start acting like a young man instead of a toddler. - As a matter of fact, her ass is on punishment right now and she ain't even gonna go the fuck back outside. - What the fuck are you doing? Dad, I swear to god. - No, no, wait. - There's no other way for you to learn this. - Dad. Please, stop. - During your first 18 years of life, if a parent or other adult in the household often or very often would swear at you, insult you, put you down or humiliate you, step inside the circle. If a parent or other adult in the household often pushed, grabbed, slapped or threw something at you, step inside the circle. If a parent or other adult in the household often or very often ever hit you so hard that you had marks or were injured, step inside the circle. If you often felt that no one in your family loved you, step inside the circle. Step inside the circle. I think society got prison wrong and they're seeing what's wrong with people instead of what happened to people. Our mission at Compassion Prison Project is to transform communities and prisons with compassionate action. An adverse childhood experience is a terrible event that continues to happen to a child. And there's no way to know when it's gonna happen again, which puts the kid into a hypervigilant state. I have eight of those aces, and when I found out I have eight adverse childhood experiences and that my behavior was a direct result of the trauma that I experienced in childhood, it changed my life. Men and women in prison, 64% of them have six or more of those. - Hi. Gabor. - Monique. - Monique? Hi, Gabor. I feel like I'm in a throne. I wanna talk to you guys about why you think you got addicted, about what may have happened to you as a child, the way you saw yourself as being deficient, somehow. - I was kidnapped at 16 and sold off. So that's a trauma and that's just something that's in my life that you can't turn around, right? - Kidnapped by whom? - It was a taxi driver who took me and a girlfriend when we were 16. - Okay. - And held us for six months in a motel and sold off my virginity. - And the police was looking for you all that time, and... - Well, my mom just thought that I had run away from home, so she didn't look for me. - She didn't look for you? - No. - I really need your permission to continue or not to continue. - It's okay. I give my permission. - The taxi driver knew exactly who to kidnap. The predator can always tell who is without protection. Anybody hit you as a child? - Yes, my father. He would spank us and take a belt to us. - Do you remember how that felt to you? - Like I just remember the pain of it, instead of thinking, oh, why? Why did I deserve this? I just remember the pain and the... - And how long did that go on for? - Well until I was approximately 16 and started fighting back. - So, 10 or 11 years? - Yeah. - Okay. Let's say you're the mother of the five-year-old and this five-year-old is being hit with a belt, and she's in pain. She doesn't understand, you know, she's just, it just hurts. And it hurts emotionally because this man who is supposed to love me is beating me. So when you're being hit like that, there's only two possibilities. My father is a bad person or hates me or I'm a bad person. So the only protection is to believe that, oh, I'm not lovable. Let's say you're the mother of the five-year-old. Who would you want that five-year-old to talk to? - Myself. - Okay. Who did you talk to? - Nobody. - That's the trauma. In other words, by the time you were five-years-old, you were completely alone. What I'm suggesting really, Alicia, is that your mother was traumatized, too. Do you know anything about her childhood? - Well, she was abused as a child as well from an alcoholic father. - See, she learned in her childhood not to pay attention to her feelings. That's the only way she could survive. - Yeah. - So the reason she didn't know it was not because she didn't love you, but because she herself was shut down inside. And that's what I'm saying, it's multi-generational - Mm-hm. - Okay? - It sucks. - Yeah. You can't pick out who's at fault here. It didn't begin with anybody. It goes on and on and on from one generation to the next. - We were talking about the effects of slavery on our behavior, and I'll be honest with you, I ain't agree with it when I first heard it. But then when he talked about the discipline I had a flashback of how I used to get whipped with a bullwhip. Naked. I hadn't put the two and two together, but I realized, that's how slaves were whipped, because it was generational trauma passed on from one mother to another mother to another mother and then passed on to me. I still got marks on my legs and stuff behind that. And I just remembered there was no one I could run to. No one that would help me. And she just was telling me how much she loved me as she cried and she beat me with a bullwhip. - He's the best-selling author of four books published in 12 languages sold on five continents. Please welcome Dr. Gabor Mate. - I actually wrote my speech out tonight, which I don't usually do but maybe of nervousness in front of this group of strong women. The truth is that guys are afraid of women. I don't know if you realize that, but that's, a lot of the stuff that we do is totally out of fear. Well, When you felt bad as a kid, who did you speak to? When the pain is there and there's no one to share it with, and the child's got very limited resources, to deal with that, and what they do is they disconnect from themselves. When you disconnect from yourself, you no longer have yourself. You've lost yourself. When we talk about trauma, we usually think of something terrible happening to a person but that's not the only trauma there is. As the other kind of trauma may not have to do with terrible things happening to you. - Most people look at my childhood and they're like: damn, you had an awesome childhood, and because I had everything. I come from upper, upper middle class, you know, in Idaho, and I got everything given to me, but that was their way of parenting. They'd give me everything. So I'd shut up and wouldn't bug them. They were too busy, they were always working. - So children don't get traumatized because they get hurt. Children get traumatized because they're alone with the hurt. - I'm a lifer inmate. I'm here on a first degree murder. I committed my crime when I was 20-years-old. And I asked myself what events in my life brought me to the point where I could think that it's okay to take a human life? And it had to do with a lot of adverse childhood experiences. My main one as to why I started going downhill was being abandoned by my father. I looked up to him. I wanted to be just like my dad. He was my hero. When I turned eight or nine-years-old, he got deported to Mexico, and that devastated me. As a kid, my mom used to tell me, Mi hijo, pray to God that he will come back, but he never came. - A baby that you don't pick up will actually die. Even if you feed them and you change them and look after them, because they get overwhelmed by their feelings and they get over stressed. And so the baby needs the mother's and the father's brain to regulate her own brain, to regulate her emotions. It's not just that you're overwhelmed. It's also there's nobody there to hold you. There's a huge school of thought in North America that teaches mothers to help their babies sleep by ignoring their crying. Nevermind the mother's milk, the infant just wants to attach, because the only way the infant can attach is physically. When he's not being held, he's not being attached to them. When that's done night after night after night, that's traumatic. And we're still telling mothers to do that. If you actually look at genuine human needs, if you connect the gut and the heart and the soul, then there's nothing more normal than a child sleeping in the arms of a parent. So I've often thought about the sources of my own issues. An infant two months of age in Hungary, when the Germans, the Nazis, marched into the country and they began to exterminate the Jewish population. So that was my first year of life, with a terrorized mother, grandparents killed in Auschwitz, a father away in forced labor, antisemitism, the ever nearing shadow of annihilation, and ultimately a separation from my mother. I was a little short of one-year-old when my mother had to hand me to a stranger in the ghetto of Budapest and send me away to some relatives in hiding, so we didn't see each other for six weeks, and she didn't know if she would live or not. In her diary she said: "this was the hardest six weeks of her life." That was the experience of the first nearly year and a half of my life. And sometimes I thought, well, gee, I must have received a lot of love at the same time otherwise I'd be a lot more crazy than I actually am. For trauma to happen, you don't need second World War and you don't need racism, you don't need genocide, and you don't need the privations of war. You just need parents who are so alienated from their own gut feelings that they will let their infants cry without picking them up and that child is desperate for a relationship. That's all it takes. - Well, hi. - Hi Alison. - Welcome. - Hi, Gabor. - Welcome, Gabor. - Wow. What a view. - Thank you. For me being a drug addict, the deep down need to escape, I think it's almost into a more realistic place than the insanity that we see, the chaos we see around us. I just wanted that place all the time. I can really talk for the 37 years I've been recovered and have had slips in the program, quote, AA. - And what's the fear? - Well, the fear is I'll be abandoned. It's back with the homo sapiens, I'll be thrown out of the cave. - What is your fear of being abandoned? - Well naturally that I'll die unless I do all of the stuff for other people. - When you do all the stuff for the people, - Mm-hm. - what are you doing to yourself? - I'm abandoning me. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. - So you're actually enacting your worst fear. - Mm-hm. I was the youngest of five, very ambitious family, very successful, except everyone's an alcoholic. I go in the bar, they're drinking. There's no room for me. It's like, oh, shut up Alison, shut up. You're wrong. You're wrong. So my job was to be wrong in the family. I'll never forget my mother saying to me: "I just don't understand you!" And I was six-years-old and I thought, my god, if you don't understand me, I'm lost. - Allow me to give you another perception of you. You're the one that more than others absorbs all the pain and stress in the family. And then you manifest it and they can't stand seeing it. So in exiling you, they're exiling their own pain and stress. - Right, right. - As a child, we have two fundamental needs. One need that's with us since infancy, and it's absolute and it's not negotiable is attachment. And so the other need then is authenticity. Authenticity, therefore, is the connection to ourselves, because without authenticity, without a connection to our gut feelings, just how long do you survive out there in nature? So authenticity is not some new age, pseudo-spiritual concept. It's actually a survival necessity. What happens if in order to survive or to adjust to your environment, you have to suppress your gut feelings, you have to suppress your authenticity? So normal society does not allow anger, and the child who's angry must be separated. In other words, we have to threaten his attachment to relationships, on which is life depends so that he can suppress his emotions. Well that child, if he learns the lesson well, will disconnect from their anger, and then he's a sitting duck for depression, mental illness or for physical illness. Okay, so kid is angry, but how about helping him move through the anger to learn how to modulate it? Not to repress it, but to learn to become friends with it. We don't want people that are not angry. We want people to know that anger doesn't have to be destructive. What were you pushing down when you were depressed? - Anger. - Right. You were pushing down- - Rage. - You were pushing down your anger, right? - Yeah. - Can you see how why for a six-year-old it might be a really brilliant idea to push down the rage? - Yeah. - Why? - For survival. - Exactly. You talked about your many failures. I just want you to pick one. - The fear if left on my own, I won't get out of bed. I've done that before. - And you regard that as a failure? - Falling apart I regard that as a failure. - You regard that as a failure? - Right. - Okay. So your failure is that you got depressed and as you put it, you fell apart. Is that the failure? - Yeah. - Just identify the age that you first recall being depressed then. - Probably about six or seven. - How old are your kids now? My oldest daughter is 33, my son is 30 and my youngest daughter's 27. - Okay. Choose one as a thought experiment right now, and I want you to imagine them at age seven. - Mm-hm. - Let's say they get depressed. Would you go to them and say: "You are total failure?" - Of course not. - Why not? Notice you're calling yourself a failure? I'm going to say something radical to you. - Okay. - The depression was a major success, not a failure. Okay? Now I know that sounds ridiculous, but- - No, no. I'm listening. You're telling me that having that pain showed me deeper inside of myself, how I was abandoning myself. - Precisely. So maybe you want to stop calling it a failure. - Mm-hm. - You go through your whole life like that and see how everything that you judge about yourself actually served the purpose at the time. - Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hm. - Really, isn't it simple? - It is simple. - Gabor Mate, thanks very much for coming on Under the Skin. The reason I'm so excited to talk to you, the reason that I believe you're having such an important cultural impact is because of your rare compassion and insight into the world of addiction. When it was heroin, I would like have, I would reflect. Well, after I'd used and just go, right, this isn't for me, this has got to stop. This is not a sustainable system. - You think you'd never need it anymore 'cause you feel complete. - Mm. - And then comes the remorse of what have I done? And then you say I don't need to do to this ever again. And then by the time I'm home, I'm running back to the store again to get the next thing that I didn't buy. In the life of every person who's ever been addicted and ever will be addicted, there's always trauma. An addiction is any behavior that a person finds relief in the short term and craves but suffers negative consequences and cannot give it up. There are so many addictions. Could be drugs, obviously, alcohol, nicotine. Could also be sex, could be gambling, could be shopping, could be eating, could be pornography, could be the internet, could be gaming, could be work, could be relationships. That's what an addiction is. First issue is not why the addiction but why the pain? In our society there are two myths around addiction. The pernicious line is the belief that addiction is a choice and that the decisions that arise out of addictions are therefore a matter of individual culpability. And so therefore addicts for the most part are punished for being addicted. Now the other belief around addiction, but still misleading, is that it's an inherited disease, it's a biological disorder of the brain. That belief is more humane, much more than the choice belief, because at least if somebody inherits a disease, they're not to be punished for it but they are to be provided with treatment as with any disease. However, it's also misleading because it ignores why people really get addicted, which has got nothing to do with disease. It's among the normal human responses to trauma. When people are suffering, they want to escape their suffering. That's normal. - My name is Tuta Ponchiao Chi. I'm 43-years-old. I come from a family of Thai restaurant owners. I moved away when I was 14. I was never good enough. I mean, I think if I had parents who didn't really care and was lenient, no, I don't think I would have really got right into it and really got addicted. I might've just, you know, tried it once or twice, but I think the pressure was on from the upbringing and having to feel like I had to achieve and be the best of what I did, an A student. And so when I moved away, I really wanted to prove not just myself but to them that I was more than what they saw. You know, I did apply to Stanford University. That was my number one choice. I was disappointed I didn't get in. And San Francisco State University was my second choice and while there I did do the same things that I was doing when I was in high school, playing for the NCWA, singing choir. With doing so many things, pledging sororities and doing, being different club members, I'm saying I was just trying to find my way in the world. And then I started to work at the nightclubs here. And so I think that's when I really evolved because I wanted to do everything. I wanted to go to school, I wanted to work, but I needed to do homework as well. So the pressure was on then. So then it got into heavier drugs, so I needed the meth to stay up. - I think our society just doesn't understand addiction. Without the addiction, they felt incomplete, they felt this huge emptiness inside. It's as if the addiction was to complete themselves, and to somehow temporarily cover up the emptiness. Why the finger-pointing, why the judgments on a particular group of people who are addicted who happen to use substances? My first job that I ever had as a physician in Vancouver after I did my internship was actually in the downtown east side of Vancouver. It's North America's most concentrated and most dramatic area of drug use where there's more people injecting and ingesting and inhaling all kinds of substances than anywhere else in the planet. And I go this old, broken down hotel with cracking paint on the walls and there's strange people walking in and out, and I felt totally at home right away. And after two years, I shifted my full-time work to the downtown east side. So I worked there for 12 years. They all had suffered tremendous torment as children, which also meant that their addictions were extreme. They were quite willing to sacrifice love, life, relationship, health just for the next hit. They were that desperate to escape from reality because reality had been so cruel to them. We were dealing with people with severe infections. They would inject drugs. That would give them abscesses, not only in their skin or their muscles, but also in their brains, in their spinal cord, in their joints. So they have to be hospitalized, which is the only facility where you can deliver IV antibiotics several times a day. But they were users, so there'd be always absconding from the hospital and even using the IV lines to inject through. So inevitably they would be kicked out of hospital, which means that their life-threatening infections would be untreated. This is how I met Joey Carter. I think I pushed him across an intersection once in his wheelchair, maybe that's the first time we actually met. - And you helped me out and you said, what are you doing? Enough's enough. I'm going to admit you to CTC-R, are you going to go there? And I was like, well, what about my addiction? And then you said, well, what are you using? And I said, well, I've been using morphine and m-eslon. I said, how many will you give me a day? You said as many as you have in your pocket. - By meeting people where they're at and treating them like human beings and not trying to change them actually opens up the possibility of transformation for them. And Joey's a plain example. - 'Cause they had come in like every four hours to give me my morphine. - Yeah. - And I wasn't needing it. I was saving it, right. And I woke up and there is like morphine all over the bed and I thought it was in heaven. - I do recall your poetry, and you were a very, a very avid writer. - Yeah. - And you've shared some of that with me. Is there one that, you know, that you can recite now? - Yeah. It goes I misbehave when I crave to push the venom in my veins. I lose all control of my inner soul and my demons hold the reins. I deceive whoever believes, I twist their open trust. With nefarious precision and tunnel vision, I pursue the venom with lust. With the desire so strong, I forget all bonds hurting the ones I adore, And even though they love me, they move on from me to let me fight my war. Uncontrollable, I'm inconsolable, slowly I'm dying inside. A glutton of such, I've used too much, now there's no life in my eyes. - Wow. I wanna talk to you guys about why you think you got addicted? Like, what did it do for you in the short term that you wanted it, like you appreciated it? - The one thing that I've learned was gratification through sex. It would pay my rent, it would pay my food, it would pay my clothes. But it was also feeling loved. - Feeling loved? Like... - Having that desire for somebody to care and- - And want you. - Want you. - I wouldn't be able to have a sexual relationship if I wasn't using, because I couldn't feel anything towards the other person. - It made you feel more alive? - Yeah. It made me feel more in tune. - Yeah. - Yeah, like that's... And I used it to have feelings. - I didn't feel pretty, I didn't feel like... And as soon as I would do a little bit of drugs, my self-esteem would instantly go up. - I did so much sports and was on such a strict schedule that when I started to use in like grade eight, grade nine, like, I was free. - So freedom. Sense of aliveness. Completion. Self-esteem. These are all wonderful things, aren't they? When they talk about addiction being a bad choice, I say no, it isn't. It's actually a solution to a problem. If we understand that the addiction is not the primary problem, but really a response to trauma, then it becomes obvious that in order to heal addiction, you have to heal the trauma. But it means that you see the wound that's driving that person. Underneath that traumatized persona, there's the healthy individual who has never found expression in this life because they were never given the venue for expression, never given the relationships, in which they could, their all authentic humanity could be expressed. Are we free? Are we conscious? Are we making a decision based on full awareness or are we driven by unconscious dynamics that we've inherited or that we developed as a response to childhood trauma? Well, insofar as we're not conscious, we are not free. We have then a social structure that induces trauma in a lot of people, therefore it induces escapist, addictive behaviors in a lot of people, and those inner trends line up with how society looks like on the outside. So therefore all this looks perfectly normal and perfectly natural. Fundamentally the message is that with our minds we create the world. So if I have a worldview that the world is a horrible place, then I'm going to live in a world where I have to be aggressive, suspicious, competitive and make myself as big as possible so I don't get eaten up. So I have to be grandiose and cunning because that's the world I'm living in. And these are the people that our society rewards with power. - Do you think that the inability of these individuals to manifest real change is a demonstration that what we have are deeply entrenched and traumatized systems that are predicated on unconscious choices, unconscious drives and that the system cannot and will not alter itself from within itself, but will sustain itself, and it's only sort of new, radical ideas that can alter it? - That's exactly what I'm saying. Large segments of the economy survive because people buy things that give them temporary pleasure but do them no good whatsoever in the long-term, in fact are even harmful. I mean, we're going so far as to destroy the earth because of our addiction. The disconnect from the body of the earth really has to do with the disconnect from our own bodies. The two are together. And the exploitation of the earth as if it was something separate from us has a lot to do with patriarchal domination. I mean, we talk about mother earth. Look what we're doing to mother. It's a mother hatred almost. It speaks to a blindness and a passivity which itself is a marker of societal and collective trauma. Our schools are full of kids with learning difficulties, mental health issues that are trauma-based, but the average teacher never gets a single lecture on trauma. They're fundamentally working with an essential lack of information. I actually barely mentioned the criminal justice system has no understanding or even acquaintance with the concept of trauma. In fact, they often create policies that further deepen people's trauma. That these institutions need to be informed of what trauma is and how to respond to it. - I went between custodies of different states and counties... Since 18. I struggled with addiction and they were sending me to these places to get the help that you needed. I had nothing but the authorities telling me that it was my fault, my fault, my fault, because you're choosing this, you know and I can't keep choosing it. And you're supposed to trust and believe in these people. California industrialized prison. - Trauma doesn't know of color, trauma doesn't know of age, trauma doesn't know a tax bracket, trauma doesn't know any of these things. Anybody can be traumatizing anybody. Symptoms of trauma: nightmares and night terrors. - Inability to love. - Addictive behavior. - Insomnia. - Depression. - Shame. - That's not who you are, but it's a symptom of being traumatized, and we're here to heal each other. We heal in community. When I do these circles with anybody, when they see the extent of childhood trauma in themselves, but also in the people around them, it's a shift. It takes the othering out. It actually brings a human in. And that, as a society, is one of the imperatives that we need to get to. We gotta start seeing each other for what happened to us and not what's wrong with us. - My name is Romie Nottage. I am the senior director of San Francisco and social innovation for Downtown Streets Team, and that is changing the lives of people who are currently homeless through the dignity of work. Labeling people as just drug addicts, like, it's deeper than that. They probably at a younger age have been reinforced that their value is not as significant as others. The pain is the root cause of people trying to feel comfortable in this world. Using street drugs is a method. It is a behavior to support something that is uncomfortable. - I was homeless for about 15 years. It is a survival of the fittest. I had three kids on the street while homeless, walking around, no shoes, selling drugs, doing drugs, hoping they would miscarry. All the babies came out with everything. Meth, crystal, cocaine, everything you could think of. I did utilize those three moments in time where I had those babies to just rest up in a nice place and eat a hot meal. Just basically took a shower those three times, 'cause while I was homeless, most of us don't shower. Maybe once a year, if that. But I was lucky I had the same foster mom, all three boys. Albert, Jetson and James are all thriving. They're very healthy. I did fight for them. Don't get me wrong. I did try to fight for them, but I wasn't ready to give up the drug life. - It was fall, so it was the rain season. I just remember that constant worry about where was I gonna go that night? Would I find shelter? 'Cause there's no where to go, right? The people that did love me just said you know what? We're not going to stand by anymore while you kill yourself. We can't do it. It's hurting more. We're dying a harder death than you are. And they just scattered from my life. I was utterly alone. - I've been in the city on the streets now for four years. Went to college on my GI bill. I was in the army for a total of 11 years, then I got diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and I retired. My PTSD comes from experiences with trying to beat this monkey on my back, you know? I've had a beautiful home and vehicles and wife and kids and thrown it all away for drugs. - So when you pass by someone homeless on the street, that is such a painful world to live in, and a very important thing to do is acknowledge them and not pretending or literally thinking that no one's sitting right there. How are you doing? Hanging in there? Had a rough sleep last night? You stay in the TL? - I do. - Yeah, cool. How long have you been here? - I moved here from Atlanta February the 7th. - The number one thing that people who are experiencing homelessness suffer from is feeling looked down on. It's like people just passing by them, not acknowledging their experience. That forms an identity that is internalized. Their sense of self has been attacked. Their dignity has been completely reinforced as non-existent every single day. Humanization of homelessness is where we need to start because we're working with people, we're working with nervous systems, we are working with deflated and traumatized senses of self. To be honest, if I lived in that world, I would want to use, too. It'd get me out of it. It'd make me feel not like that for a minute. - Hey, Duane, you home? It's Tessa. Hey, how are you? - Hi, how are you? - I'm Tessa. I'm a harm reduction specialist at Abode Housing Services. I help people move through the pain of their addiction and regain dignity. So, oh my gosh, your place looks amazing. I took this job because of the harm reduction approach, where people get housing. You don't have an agenda. You must do this or that in order to access housing, you're worthy of housing because housing should be a right. When people get housed after they've been outdoors for seven, 15, 25 years, whatever the number is, you're alone. You don't have survival to do, so this is when I'm starting to see everybody's pain start surfacing and people are starting to have, you know, more challenges and emotional challenges than they did out on the streets. Dr. Gabor Mate, when I found his teachings, and specifically The Realm of the Hungry Ghost kind of changed my outlook in life. I'm very dear to this work. - I'm Gabor's wife and I have been for close to 50 years. I met Gabor in October of 1967 when I was a first year student at UBC. I saw in the student newspaper that they were looking for cartoonists and I draw. I walked into the small room and he's sitting there reading a book and I said: "My name's Rae. I'm supposed to draw you. Would you mind just sitting there?" This is it. I did this before I knew who he was, before I'd had a conversation. What a mysterious guy. Dark, you know? Intense. He was so interesting to me. - I've always been a rebel. I mean, in communist Hungary, in grade six, my teacher wrote in my report card that: you should watch it because he incites the other students. But so that tendency to resist arbitrariness, what I'm being told and what the official line is. So I'm really not one for group-think, and it really helps me to see through all kinds of nonsense that people accept without questioning. On a personal level, I'm also a contradiction. My longing is really a sense of being excluded from something, and a sense of impossibility, and I very easily go there. I mean, that is my baseline. - Very early in my meeting with Gabor, I saw clearly the light that he was and the dark that he was. So I saw brilliance and I saw real, I guess trauma is the word I'd use now, but I didn't know then. To me it was dark. And of course, by then I knew he was, directly had been in the Holocaust, but it was going to be my job to heal him, to bring out that light. I really believe that the purpose of marriage is to actually go back to the original trauma, which comes from the family. I married a man who was so much like my father. - My scientific interest as well has been having to deal with my own trauma because in my 40s, I was a very successful physician and I was a national columnist for a Canadian newspaper, and I was the head of the palliative care department at a major Canadian hospital, and I was depressed and alienated, in a difficult marriage, and my children were scared of me and I didn't like being alive. - Well, there's just nothing more frustrating to be in a situation, to see him out there doing this amazing work, just the healing and the wisdom and the support, and then come home and be completely exhausted, irritable. And then I get the negativity. I have to be me, I have to be authentic. My nervous system is so wired that if I'm not authentic to myself, I'm sick. I have a stomach ache. I can't sleep. I'm anxious. And it's usually here. It's usually something in this dynamic. - Yeah. - Right? - When I would compulsively shop for compact discs and lie about it. Rae would get neck aches. And after a while she figured out if I got a neck ache, this guy is lying to me. - He doesn't get away with anything. - Yeah. - How are you, Gabor Mate, not processing your trauma? - How am I not processing it? - Yeah, because like, if you are not doing it, that's like Steve Jobs going: "I couldn't get my phone to work." - That's another traumatized person, by the way, whose cancer is everything to do with the childhood trauma that he experienced, but that's another book and another story. - So you sort of are a bit like in the Matrix, when Neo sees everything's made out of numbers, you look at people and you see all their trauma and damage? - That's what I see. Until I realized that I was traumatized, which really wasn't until my late 30s and mid-40s, and began to realize that it didn't have to be this way, that there were reasons for it, and I started looking for those reasons. So I started waking up fairly late in life. I was a driven, workaholic doctor. Now why was a driven workaholic doctor? Because the message I got as an infant is that the world didn't want me. Now how do you deal with not being wanted? You make yourself needed. So if you're traumatized and if you don't think you're lovable, my god, go to medical school. Now they're going to want you all the time. When they're dying, when they're being born, every moment in between, and that's highly addictive, because you get the validation all the time. A lot of people that go into medicine the last thing they want is to be open and vulnerable. In fact, what they want is the authority of the white coat and the stethoscope. And medical school is very hard on people. You might look at it almost as a selection process that weeds out the people that are too vulnerable. The long hours, the deference to unreasonable authority, the stress that you are willing to subject yourself to, and these are the people that, like me, become physicians. So that selects out against the vulnerable. I went to medical school here at UBC. At that time, we did not get a single lecture of trauma. We did not even hear the word. They still don't hear the word trauma in medical school. So I've looked at the whole range of human experience from birth to death because I've worked in obstetrics and I've worked in palliative care and everything else in between. The modern medical paradigm in practice separates mind from the body and it separates the individual from the environment. So when you look at, there's an epidemic of asthma right now in North America, more and more people, kids are being diagnosed with it, it's all about, or largely about, the increasing stress in our society. So it's a cultural manifestation, and this is completely missing in medical practice. If you look at Black Americans, Black Americans are more likely to get prostate cancer and more likely to die of it, and not because of a lack of medical care. Maybe there's something about being a minority in this particular culture that is so highly stressful that it deranges the immune system. If you look at the asthmatic Afro-American woman, is that asthma a manifestation of her own pathology? Or is it reflecting a social malaise? Which means the emotion, whatever you've experienced, probably suppressed rage or shame, whatever you experience, actually affects the physiology of your lungs. Medicine is very interesting that way. If you go to a dermatologist with an inflamed skin, what kind of cream are they going to give you? Anybody know? Steroid cream, right. If you go to a rheumatologist with an inflamed joint, what medication are they going to give you? Steroids very often. If you go to a lung specialist with asthma, what kind of inhaler are you going to get? Steroid. If you go to a gastroenterologist with an inflamed intestines, what kind of medication are you gonna get? Steroids. Now, what are steroids? They're copies of cortisol. What is cortisol? The stress hormone. We're treating everything with stress hormones. Maybe it should occur to us that stress has something to do with the onset of these conditions. The fundamental problem is capitalism, or I should say materialism. As long as the research is driven by the profits of pharmaceutical companies, what's going to drive the education of physicians except the profit motive of pharmaceutical companies? I mean, it's just obvious. People have to be seen as automatons, as beings without really emotional needs or spiritual needs. As globalization and globalized materialism spreads throughout the world, so there's auto immune disease spreading throughout the world in societies that hardly even knew them before. Diseases, whether mental or physical, are normal responses to abnormal circumstances, and what would be considered normal in this society is often actually insane. In the most health obsessed humans society ever, all is not well. In the US, the richest society in history, fully half of the citizens have a chronic disorder such as high blood pressure or diabetes. Illness is when part of an organism, starts working against the overall benefit of the organism. So that say, in an autoimmune disease, the immune system attacks the host organism. So a system that was designed by nature to protect you now it turns against you. Cell division, which is meant to be coordination with the needs of the entire organism, gets out of hand and now you've got cancer. The search is always to find out what's wrong with the individual cell, or how do you kill the abnormal cells? So the treatment is restricted to the biological plane. We either cut it out or we poison it or we burn it. That's our approach to treating cancer. Most chronic illness is a way of the body saying no when the person suppress their no's in order to fit in. I'm saying that when the illness comes along, we can just look upon it as a nuisance to get rid of and an enemy to fight, or we can say, okay, well, it's here now. What's the teaching? Which it doesn't mean that we don't accept treatment or we don't do our best to heal, but that, as part of that healing process, we actually ask ourselves what does this mean about my life and my relationships and particularly about how I treat myself? What is the teaching? - My name is Tim. I'm 51-years-old. I was given a diagnosis of prostate cancer about a year and a half ago. I actually had a full, radical prostatectomy, so that means the whole removal of my prostate which was no walk in the park. It's quite a, quite an extensive surgery. In October they did a bone scan and found that there was multiple areas in my spine, ribs and some pelvis that the cancer had metastasized to, which was devastating to me at the time. There was no need for me to have the operation. If someone has prostate cancer and they have the prostate removed but the cancer is still in their body, then the surgery hasn't done any good. There was no root cause analysis of why I got it. What I soon discovered was that everything was a band-aid. - The average general practitioner under the insurance programs gets to see a person for 6 minutes and a psychiatrist gets to see them for 10 minutes. What can you do in 10 minutes? You can adjust medications. And the average psychiatrist today is not trained in psychotherapy. They are trained in what's called biological psychiatry which fundamentally means altering the biology of the brain by handing out prescriptions, which never get to the heart of the problem. So while I'm not dogmatically opposed to medications, in the contrary, I acknowledge their value in my own life, they are not the answer. And at the very best they should be only as a stop gap measure until we get to work on the real issues. Why this disease, why in this person and why now? Unless I answer those questions, unless I ask those questions, we can't talk about wholeness. We can't talk about healing in the deepest sense. - I grew up in a family with a father who was very angry and never even realized it because for me it was just natural and normal. As a kid I didn't know any different, and I was very scared. Anytime I acted out in anger, it always backfired, so I could never express that anger. So I decided to go more on a healing journey myself and try to find out what could I do myself to be able to maybe cure this thing, or at least live longer, feel better and address it at many different levels. So I turned to ayahuasca mainly because of the anxiety and realizing like what's a deeper spiritual reason that I got this diagnosis? Why did I get this cancer? I got more out of ayahuasca in one journey than I probably did in five years of psychoanalysis. - What I know about ayahuasca in the healing of addiction, ayahuasca being an Amazonian brew which has got psychedelic qualities. It can induce visions and deep experiences. So there was a ceremony here led by a Peruvian shaman and within half an hour of having ingested the brew, it felt very much real, it felt very much like me, but it was new because I experienced a state of, um, such deep love and gratitude such as I have not recalled experiencing before. And I saw that my own addictive behaviors were driven precisely because I hadn't been able to experience that kind of love and that kind of gratitude. From that state, there's no need to look for anything else outside of yourself. And I also learned very shortly that the ayahuasca has the power to teach people about their trauma, to actually show them what happened to them. All of a sudden, oh yes, this is what happened. This is why I decided that life is unbearable. This is why I decided that I wasn't lovable. This is why I decided that I had to soothe myself from the outside because there was no peace inside, and immediately I sat down and I worked with this. And once you start working with one psychedelic then you become aware that there's a whole world out there and there's a whole resurgence now in the healing powers of psychedelic modalities, and so there are other substances. The deep therapeutic potential of psychedelics resides in the fact that they get the conditioned mind out of the way. So people have access to two aspects of reality that they're usually not in touch with. One is the deep trauma and pain that they're carrying that they can actually look at now, and in an appropriate, compassionate, safe context they can experience these troubled emotions and mind states without having to be driven into insanity or having to escape. If you're going to use psychedelics, it has to be combined with very adept therapy at the same time. So in my work with Tim tomorrow, we'll be using one of these modalities to see if he can be guided deep into himself so that some answers may emerge for the existential and life issues that he's facing. Hey, Tim. - Hi, Gabor. - Come on in. How are you? - Good, thank you. - You're all set? - Yeah, I'm all set. - Okay, come on in. The medication will take about half an hour to take effect. When you're ready, just ingest it. You've been diagnosed with prostate cancer. - Correct. - And stage four means that it's spread to elsewhere in the body? - Yes, it spread to bone. Places in my spine, pelvis and ribs. - In my view of people that develop cancer tend to be nice people who are more concerned with the emotional needs of others than their own. They have a hard time expressing healthy anger. And also they have this belief that they must not disappoint anybody. How do you feel when you perceive that somebody is not seeing you, is not listening to you? - I felt very sad and probably a bit of a tinge of anger there too, as well. Yeah. - So how about if we rephrase that? - Aha, anger. Yeah, yeah, I felt anger. - What do you feel in your body when you say those things? Just check in with your body. What's happening there? - I feel a little bit energized from it, just to saying it, yeah. Absolutely. I feel a little bit more awake. - So notice how you deprive yourself of energy. - Mm-hm. - Okay. - That makes me just really sad just thinking about that. Man it feels good to feel. But underneath that I just... Feeling this frustration. Fuck, it's too much energy that I've been holding on to contain that. Like I'm pissed off that I have to keep fucking focusing on all this shit, working on myself. I'm fucking tired of it. - So what is the thing that you need to keep your mind off? By trying to figure everything out? - This little boy that just wants to be loved and accepted unconditionally... He wasn't. And so he's had to figure out how to be accepted and loved by others, and even my internal judge. It was rough when I was angry. - You can stop all this work, just actually, just be here and whatever there is. See, as long as you don't allow the fear to be there, you're going to be always working to get rid of it. That's what the work is all about, all the work that you're doing. And then you're gonna keep working to make yourself acceptable and always nice and dutiful and all that. Or you could say, okay, the fear is there. I'll let it be there. I'm big enough to... There's enough space here for it to, to be a part of me. - It just seems too easy. - Yeah, it's gonna be a lot more complicated than that. I developed a method of therapy or exploration with people called compassionate inquiry. The essence of which is the belief that the truth is inside all of us, we just have to ask the right questions to help people arrive at the truth. If that clenched jaw could speak, what would it say now? - I don't want this anymore. - Okay. What is the this that you don't want? - That's what I don't know. - Look, if you didn't shut our mouth like this, what is it that wants to come out that we're not letting out? - Rage. - Yeah. That is the inquiry. How do you feel about that? - I think there's a few feelings associated with that. - I'm not buying that one. How do you feel towards it? How do you feel about that? I'm a part of you. How do you feel about that? What comes up right now? - Shame. - Thank you. What are you ashamed about? Do you know? - That it is a weakness. - And you must not be weak? - Correct. - Because if you're weak, then what? - I won't to be able to take care of those I love. - So you locate it and it's here in the chest area. Just put your attention on it right now. I mean, we're looking at this blockage or sense of blockage, okay? What does it want to say to you? - It's not a word. It's soothing. - It's soothing? - Yeah. Desiring. - That it's wanting soothing? - Yeah. - If you're in touch with this sense here that you've just identified, how familiar is it to you? - Oh, very. - How far does it go back? - Seven. That's when I lost my mother. But it was present before that. - Okay. - So what does it need from you? - To be held. - To be held? - Yeah. - Like your mother might've held you? - Yeah. - So when it arises, my advice is don't try and figure out how better to do your work or how better to be present or any of that, or how will I fulfill my calling? Your calling is really clear, but this part of you guess what? Needs to be here, heard and seen. - All righty. - Okay? Yeah? - Mm-hm. That makes sense. - That's good. Any questions? - I think I'm just supposed to feel right now. - Well, that's good. That means you're paying attention. He called you something. - Monster. - Oh yeah. He called me monster. - He called you monster? - He's called me delusional. - How do you feel when he calls you a monster? - I mean, I feel hurt. I feel angry. - Okay. So what if I said to you, you got beautiful green hair. How would you feel about that? - I'd laugh, I wouldn't- - Why would you laugh? - 'Cause I knew my hair is not green. - Uh huh. What if I say you were a monster? - The feeling of the anxiety was so strong that I wanted to end it. - Anything familiar about any of that? - Are you trying to go back to childhood trauma? - Who, me? You see that you developed a belief that I can't be touched, nothing can touch me. Guess what happens when you get sick? - Mm-hm. - That defense is now destroyed. - Pow. Wow. - I ask people to tell me some recent episode when they're upset with somebody in their lives, and something that they're open to sharing. So it doesn't have to be anything sordid or anything but just something, you know, whether it's your spouse, partner, the bus driver, I don't care. - Sure. - A friend. Okay, so what happened? - You want me to describe it? - What happened? Yeah. - All right, there were a number of issues in my home and I had hired someone to do these things while I was gone and I came back and none of them were fixed. - Okay. And your emotional reaction was? - Anger. - Anything else besides anger? - I was disappointed. - Disappointed is sadness. - Let's go with that. - Okay. So I'm going to ask you a silly question. What were you sad and angry about? - Well angry that someone had made commitments to me and not fulfilled those commitments. - What does that mean that they didn't fulfill their commitments? - Uh, it meant that they didn't care about me. They didn't have that... They disrespect me. - So they didn't care about you and didn't respect you. What kind of person doesn't get cared or respected? - I don't know. Someone who doesn't deserve to be cared for or respected. - Exactly. Are there other reasons why this other person might not have done the work that has nothing to do with him or her not caring about Tim or not respecting him? So what other reasons might there be? - Uh, he had a flight delay and got caught on Puerto Rico during a hurricane. - Yeah, he's got ADHD. - Yeah. - And he can't follow through, and any number of possibilities. - Yeah. - Now, of all the possibilities that you've just outlined, including that they don't care about you or respect you, which is the worst one? - The one I immediately defaulted to. - So let's notice something. A, you, I should say we, 'cause we're all like this, we don't respond to what happens. We respond to our perception of what happens. - Right. - Okay. That's what the Buddha said. It's with our minds we create the world. Number two, of all the possible interpretations, we choose the worst one. Thirdly, what I just said isn't true. We didn't choose it. It's not like you went through all these possibilities and you said- - Was a multiple choice and I chose option D. - Oh no, he doesn't care about me and he doesn't respect me. You didn't do that. Your brain jumped there automatically, right? My question is why? First time in your life that you felt hurt and angry when you perceived somebody didn't care about you and didn't respect you? - It's not the first time. - Very good. And most people I talk to, it goes back way back. - Yeah. This goes way back. - Into childhood. - Mm-hm. - Okay. And that's what trauma is. We don't respond to the present moment. We respond to the past. So who's the one that doesn't care about you and who's the one that doesn't think you're worthy of respect? - Oh, it'd be me. - It would be you. - Yeah. - So that's the learning, and that's the beauty of healing is that when you reframe things and you actually see the source within ourselves, all of a sudden that's liberating. Because guess what? If you're feeling that way because this guy did this or didn't do that, that makes you a victim. - Yeah. - But if you see that you are the source, now you're powerful. Can you have a vision of society that incorporates the achievements of modern civilization while at the same time still honors the essence of human nature? I think the answer is yes. I know the answer is yes, not that I expect to see it in my lifetime. We need trauma informed medical care, trauma informed education and trauma informed therapy. - Everybody that has listened to a talk or read his book always said to me I don't feel like I'm a bad person anymore. I can see their heads higher. Yeah, they're still using substances, but something inside of them is starting to change. That's their shame is kind of dissipating. - Without me stumbling across his work, I tell you, I tell you, I would've been a different person. Personal childhood trauma is key because once you understand that, know you were a child and you didn't have help, and if it's about love them why are we locking them up? - Underneath that traumatized persona, there's the healthy individual who has never found expression in this life. If you see that, then you're trauma informed, it's not a question of healing the trauma or of ever getting rid of the memory of what happened, but to help that person expand so that there's space for all those emotions. - Dr. Mate, he allowed me to feel that what I was seeing was a humanistic crisis. It was a human not being identified in the light in which they deserve to be. We as caretakers in this world need to see the human in front of us, not the problem. We still have each other's numbers. You'll call me? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. - All right. Good to see you, buddy. - Good to see you. I missed you. - All right. - Bye. How have you been? It cannot be a general construct of this is how we're dealing with people who are homeless, this is how we're dealing with people who are are addicted to drugs. No, this is how we deal with Sarah, this is how we deal with Jose. This is how we are in relationship to each and every person experiencing trauma within their lives. That is what has been the essence to his teaching for me. Hi, who's this? - Fang. - Hi Fang, how are you doing? Fang, are you his little companion? - When we start the journey of being compassionate with ourselves, not only does it change ourselves, it changes our communities and our society. - Today I'm still healing. I'm still healing from my abandonment issues. I'm a lifer inmate. Being here today, witnessing all you guys' traumatic experiences gives me motivation, gives me inspiration to continue on the path that I'm currently on. - Every human being has a true, genuine, authentic self. And that true, genuine authentic self can never be destroyed. - When people say you have a second chance in life, today I know what that means. So I performed for the first time singing, after not singing in 20 years. So I performed in front of over 400 people. That was a dream come true, and I was able to reunite with my mother. When God blessed me with this son, my four-year-old boy Douglas, I made a promise to myself and I said, listen, I want to be a mom. I want to be a good mom. The baby's dad is also with me. He's my babysitter. - I've been clean for the last 10 and a half months. 'Cause you did, you made a difference in my life. - Thank you for being in touch. # Through the mist and the pain # # I've learned to maintain # # There is no shame # # There is no shame # - I am happy to say now that through my own healing, after being off my medication now for six months, I've gone in remission. The cancer is just not, is not growing. This is the first time in four years where this has happened, so this is absolutely amazing. - It's been spiritual work for us both and I've grown up in the relationship. I've healed in the relationship. I'm still healing in the relationship. To me this is an incredible love story. It's really inspiring how he's changed. So as we've gotten older, somehow we've gotten freer and younger. We just get closer and closer. It gets better and better. - It's a dynamic, emergent process of confrontation with the truth that solutions will arise. Trauma involves a lifelong pushing down, a tremendous expenditure of energy, into not feeling the pain. As we heal, that same energy is liberated for life and for being in the present. So the energy of trauma can be transformed into the energy of life. # You can see it in the cars # # It's playing on the radio # # It's written in the stars # # And living in me # # You can read it in the cards # # And hear it in stereo # # It's a bullet in your heart # # And a trigger in me # # You can see it in the young # # They saw it on a video # # Loaded like a gun # # It's aiming at me # # Everybody in the run # # Talking on the telephone # # Hurry up and have fun # # 'Cause it's killing me # # Over and over and over once again # # They will find you # # You'll let them in # # Over and over and over once again # # They will find you # # Under your skin # # The way that it's working # # You know it's not working # # The way things are going # # Where are we going # # What does it matter # # It's mind over matter # # When it's all over # # Nothing is over # # Ooh ooh ooh ooh # # Ooh ooh ooh # # Ooh ooh ooh ooh # # Ooh ooh # # It's a devil in disguise # # hidden in the media # # It's a hunger in your eyes # # It's feeding on me # # Everybody with their lives # # Coming from the satellite # # I'm walking on a wire # # They keep following me # # Over and over and over once again # # They will find you # # You'll let them in # # Over and over and over once again # # They will bind you # # Under your skin # # But the way that's it working # # You know it's not working # # The way things are going # # Where are we going # # What does it matter # # It's mind over matter # # When it's all over # # Nothing is over # # The way that it's working # # You know it's not working # # The way things are going # # Where are we going # # What does it matter # # It's mind over matter # # When it's all over # # Nothing is over # # What does it matter # # It's mind over matter # # It's mind over matter #
