Go on. Slowly. Very slowly. We're approaching the G2 point. Move the stylus by one degree. - Like this? - Yes, perfect. Now move the probe towards the GMP corn plant. Very slowly. Very slowly. This is amazing! Just amazing! Come see this, Julio. Come see. Professor, it worked! Look! It's the G2 point! The G2 point! We found it! It's the G2 point! The G2 point! The G2! Dammit! We did it. We did it! You can say that again. It's wonderful! Should I call DOLO, Professor? Do I push the button? Niet, Julio. Patience. It's much too soon. Let's at least drink a toast to our bosses. They're really going to rake it in, right? Comrade, we don't work for money. Our research is for the wellbeing of humanity. Don't forget, a billion human beings suffer from hunger. You're right, Professor. A hundred times stronger than GMPs! It will be a hit. It will be a hit, big time! Aunt Hilda! Hey! Look who's here! Oh, it's Aunt Hilda. Hello. - Hello, mail lady. - Hello, botanist. You're happy this morning. It's almost the weekend. Just one more little task. Here. For the president of the Republic? Got you wondering, haven't I? Is it about the GMPs? - You still don't agree? - Right. I'm a stubborn naturalist. Who knows where it will lead. On TV, they say it's nothing to worry about. On TV! They're always spouting rubbish! Well, I'm in a hurry. I'll be off. See ya, girls! Bye! Say hello to your parents! Thank you! I will. Hello, old Melchior! You look great today! Hello, my darlings! I'm back! West Side Dad? Mom? Where are you? Dad! Mom! Hello, beautiful newcomer. Do you like it here? What? What do you want? Sure, I'll bring you water right away. Dad? Mom? Where are you? Hey... Mom! What are you doing? Look where you are! You could fall. I need some honey for toast. Get down, Mom. Be careful. We'll go and make some toast together. Oh, nice! Do you know where Dad is? Dad? Which Dad? Let's go look for him. Who is this delightful young lady? Have you forgotten already, my love? You know how to talk to cactuses. What...? Dad, this plant shouldn't be out here. Why do you lock it up? It's the GMP we isolated the other day. We must first find out whether it's dangerous. Father Marius says GMPs are cool. Plants are living beings, Daddy. It's risky, trying to manipulate them. Would you like another mustache, on your nose? Oh! Tonight's ball! I totally forgot. No, I don't think I can make it. No, no. Don't count on me. I'm sorry. Thank you. Enjoy yourselves. Oh, Dad! Good night, my darlings. Darn! The protection system's gone off! I must call Michaël. What are you doing, Professor? Well... Professor? What? Julio, I've thought about it. Given what happened, we should stop. Stop everything? But... It's the find of the century. We can't stop. There's no shame in halting negative research. I have a bad feeling. It might put humanity at great risk. We must halt this. In that case, we must call the DOLO. They pay, they decide. Niet. I'm in charge. Too much incertitude, too many risks. Hello? Hilda! What a nice surprise! Not at all! It broke? I see. Don't worry, I'll catch the next train there. You can't just abandon me. We must continue! Julio, I must go. We can talk on Monday. I don't understand, Professor. A chance like this only comes once. I've a problem with my conscience. You can't do just anything. And, as I said, I have an emergency. An emergency! An emergency with legs! And it wears skirts. Dammit! Yes, I'm listening. Hello, uh... What do you want? I wanted to say that we've made an astounding discovery. Astounding? This is no bull. We found the G2 point. Plants can now grow huge and give off a crazy amount of energy! GMPs are ridiculous in comparison. They're pathetic. Don't tire yourself out. I know. I see everything! You know everything? Even what the Professor said? Yes! He's being manipulated by that ecologist he has a crush on, while you're about to invent vegetable fission! He merits a good slap! What should I do? Just keep working as normal. I'll be in touch. That old Aldashin will pay for this. He must pay! And, as for his friend, she'll just have to wait. All out. Ouch, that hurt! Barley: 3.8 million tons. Wheat... Poultry production has increased by 3.5. Increase corn production. Yes, ma'am. Order passed. Knock, knock... Who is it? Try to guess! I think I know. My honey? Oh, I'm so glad! Come in, guys. Quick, quick! What was the code...? Darn, I've forgotten it. - Ask her. - You do it. Why is it always me? Is the honey for today or tomorrow? It's just that... We forgot the code, boss. The code? I, d, i, o, t, s. Idiots! Conceived especially for you. A new poll. 64% of the population says it is in favor of GMPs. That's an 8% progress. Oh, this is so good! What would I do without you, my sweet honey? Hello? Dolores here. Call the president. Right away, ma'am. Robert, did you see the polls? Yes, 64% is a lot. You were right. I'm always right. For you, as president, this means success. And for me and my multinational it's a lucrative business. We're both winners. What about the permit for my tests? I will grant it, of course... for a little... extra bonus. This is so good. I'll give my doggies some. It's good, isn't it? When all of our crops become GMPs, profits will skyrocket, my darlings! Not forgetting Attilio's invention, that super GMP! The profits... the profits... will double... and triple... The profits... Turner! Hey! The light! When she wants something... she clings on good! I think there have been leaks, Mr. President. Leaks? The other cereal growers are not happy. What do they know? They know about the permit granted to DOLO to plant GMPs. They want to do the same. I don't know what to say! They're harassing me. I see. So? What do I tell them? Well, listen... We'll create a commission to calm them down. Any other current affairs? No. Nothing else. Oh, yes, there's one more thing. A little record. Look. Over 30 letters signed with a stupid pseudonym: "Aunt Hilda." GMPs this, GMPs that... Public health, our children's future, and so on... Crazy old woman! Right... into the shredder with the rest. How about you? Am I scratching too hard? Feels good, huh? West Side A gigonium! Hi... Michaël! What a specimen. The most beautiful one ever. I know you love them. Oh! Thank you, thank you! I'm so happy to see you! You found the time to help this humble botanist. I'm touched. It's a pleasure for me to please you, my dear Hilda. Right... there you go. How do you feel there? What was that? It's none of your business! I have them all. Give me your bags, my dear. Make yourself comfortable. Hilda. You're... Please allow me... It's so hot. Do you have something to tell me? What...? What is that? Well, you know... DOLO bought our lab. DOLO? I can assure you... I'm guaranteed total freedom. How could you, the great Michaël Aldashin, member of the Moscow Scientific Academy, accept to work for that group? Do not formulate worries. I still lead the research. Until when? You're involved in a shady affair. You know what I think about trafficking with nature and about GMPs. I'll go fix your system. Are you still doing genetic manipulations with those DOLO people? There! It's fixed. Thank you, Professor. You do some things better than others. I've thought a lot since your last visit. You're not only trying to break the natural laws, but your scientific reasoning is at fault! It has a major flaw. A major flaw? If you've found point G2, as I fear you have, you've overlooked the result of the spinal vector. - Excuse me? - Look. It will never work! Or it'll cause great trouble. You're right. I will recalculate, big time! I would rather you just give up. As I've already told you, with or without mistakes, it's a dangerous adventure. Very dangerous. Let's get some fresh air. I need to unwind. Michaël, look at this corn field. What do you think? Amazing color, even-sized stems, nothing sticks out, fresh out from the salon. It's no doubt a GMP crop. Yes, GMPs. They've planted them even here. They can't do this! And who is behind this? I can tell you: DOLO, my dear! You must forgive me. I'm going to be very mean. I just can't allow this. Hilda! Think about it! This is useless! Chief, look at that woman! What is she doing? My God! What is all this? Take them to the station! Therefore, the court has decided, in judgment after trial and, in the final instance, for having voluntarily destroyed 2 GMP wheat plants on crop No. 138, on land in Beaumont-les-Vignes, to sentence... Hilda Bontempelli and Michaël Aldashin to 8 months in prison. Good, lawyers. Well done! 2 for the price of 1. A traitor and a pain in the ass. Good riddance! - That's unfair! - Silence! Silence! Silence, or I will evacuate the court! Listen to me! The Professor has been sentenced for something he didn't do! I'm the one who destroyed those GMPs. And I'm not fighting for me, but for all of you... Keep quiet, lady! - Shame on you, Mister! - Keep quiet! Manipulating nature is a great risk! Silence! Long Live Hilda You can't always win, Miss. I-live-in-a-bubble. DOLO, DOLO, DOLO! Come on, let's go. - The man is here, boss. - All cleaned up. We'll put him here. Few people get to see me. I made you come here for an important reason. I have a question. Can you continue the research that Aldashin abandoned? Affirmative. I have everything. I know everything. - What's your name? - Julio Attilio. Well, finish the job. We will baptize the invention "Attilem," after you. We'll do good business together, Julio... I have something for you, ma'am. A little trifle. Enough! Close your eyes. Oh! A surprise! I love surprises! Well, look. At your service, boss. You degenerate gherkin! You triple idiot! I'm allergic to all plants! I'm sorry. I am an idiot. I had no idea. Well, don't ever forget it, if you want to work with me. - Got that? - Got it... I don't know where you learned your French. It's hopeless. - I want a radical change! - Got that? What are you doing? I need a surface... If you write one more digit, I'll make you eat your pencil. No, I... I'm not kidding! You will eat it all up! Got that? Yes. Here, boy. This notebook will save you trouble. Special edition. Our hopes for GMPs... Wait! Go back, please. DOLO has made a prodigious discovery. I can assure you that we will experience a real revolution in every sector: Agri-food, energy, health... This is an historic moment for the world. So, without further delay, I now have the great honor of introducing the inventor of this wonder, a man called Julio Attilio! Ladies and gentlemen, Attilem! This new cereal will send all previous genetic research to the antiquarian's. It needs almost no pesticides or fertilizers, and extremely little water. And its profitability is multiplied by 50. It is pure perfection. Attilem! Attilem! This is going exactly as I planned. Good job, Julio! Millions of farmers are now growing Attilem. Cultivated surfaces are increasing everywhere. My body and mind both feel better. With Attilem, I stopped eating fat. This is a revolution. Hunger is disappearing all over the globe. Its energetic power is so strong that all our energy issues... Welcome, Attilem... It will solve all our problems... Peasants everywhere plant you... Attilem, Attilem, we love you... We will never be hungry again... All the sorrow in every nation is over now... I know how I'll make money when I get out of here, then. With Attilem! Now they celebrate. But it will end badly. You'll end badly. The whole world's speaking of Julio Attilio. A candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize, Le Soir... That's how it all started. Science flowed in me like a nice, cold beer. A superior force dictated formulas to me. It was amazing. Attilem is very good. For now. But we must think ahead. Right, Julio? Ahead? What do you mean? Pharmacy Hilda! I guess Attilem should have been Aldashem. Hilda, don't charge me. Sorry, I'm tired. But it's the reality. - Attilem is everywhere. - This is nothing. What do you mean? I can't sleep at night. I've gone over the calculations and it's likely that Attilem is not stable. If it is upset, the world will be destroyed! Everything is in this notebook. Attilem is a time bomb. A powerful one! I'm ashamed! Very ashamed. You should have known. I warned you. My parents are waiting. Let me go. I want to redeem myself. I want to fight with all my strength. The evil is done. Niet. I will take it to the top. To the top? You mean... The president? - Da! - You still believe in him? He sees Attilem as something personal, so he... Him? Do whatever you want. If there's a chance... Let me go. I must return to my greenhouse. Do you want a go? Want to go for a spin? Mom, Dad! I love you so much! Mutants? The metamorphosis has begun. Mr. Aldashin, I've spoken to the president. Unfortunately, he won't be able to meet you. His agenda is so... But I have very important things to tell him! A complete, explosive dossier. We know your theories, Professor. They are obsolete. The world has changed, accept that! That is not the point! We're heading for a global disaster! I have proof! Well, alright. Give me that. The president will look at it. Leave your phone number with the secretary. We will call you back. "A global disaster..." Hey! Sir! You can't stay here. - Hilda! - Hilda! We know what you're feeling. He thinks of you too. He thinks of me? - Yes. - Of course! Michaël! Hey, Ike, I think we should get a move on. Why, Turner? Can't you guess? - No. - Can't you see we'll have a big... no, a huge problem? Uh... What problem? You numbskull! What will become of the fat madwomen without honey? Dammit... You're right. I hadn't thought of that. Hey, Ike, did your mom ever tell you you're an idiot? Hey, wait! Where will we get more now? There's nothing but Attilem. You're starting to get it. Where are you going, guys? We're going to get provisions for the... Uh, Dolores. Let me take care of it. Whew! That was close! Do you want something sweet, dear? Attilem now, Attilem forever. The plant that was announced as a great invention appears to be a threat. Some say "terrifying." Infra-molecular mutations are affecting other species, which are changing in real time. The incontrollable Attilem has invaded every continent. We are to expect the worst. Attilem mutations are generalized! People want answers. - Down with Attilem! - Oh boy! Sooner than I expected. So, what's the problem? Well... Attilem is getting out of control. Well, that's good for us. When the time comes, we'll destroy everything. The more there is, the better for us. Right? Nobody has yet found a way to neutralize Attilem. Well, guess who is going to invent that poison? What, me? That's impossible! I can call Aldashin if you want. Don't bother. I can manage. Unlimited budget... Unlimited budget! 22 departments are on orange alert, and more will... We're expecting winds of over 130 km/h. The coasts will be affected. Special edition: Attilem's hyper-domination is scary. All other plants are disappearing. International organisms have sounded the alarm and predicted an unprecedented ecological, economic, and political catastrophe. Every continent is infested. - The ravages are... - Right! A major environmental disaster has been announced for our planet. My dear friends, I have a very bad feeling. You are safe here, for now. But you must get ready, just in case. If any danger should approach, the No. 1 rule is to keep your sap cold. Then close your leaves to protect yourselves. Do not give in to any form of panic. I am counting on you! Hilda! Hilda! Jeez! This is even better than I thought! - What is that? - Asparagus! You dummy! I can't believe it! Hilda! Ike! Turner! - Here. - Here. What was your job again, boys? Well... to bring you the buzz, buzz... So what is this? Any explanation? We looked everywhere! I swear, boss! - Even on the Internet. - It's all gone. "It's all gone..." Gibberish. You idiots! Go to this address. They'll have some. But... How...? Well? Get out of here, now! Are you deaf or stupid? Get out of here, immediately! - Dolores! I got the sample. They found a miracle product. Cool. Have you checked it works? Well... Not yet. Down with Attilem! This is a piece of Attilem. Look. One drop is enough. My goodness! Result: All gone! Now, if I understand correctly... We're saved! This is a great occasion to redeem yourself. I'm giving the order to start using that product, now! Hold on! Let's not get carried away. You could ruin my business. Are you sure this is it? Yes, I think so. Ike! Ike! Tell me it's not true! Why would I say that? Come on, please. - Tell me! - Oh, I see... Look! Beehives! Bees! Honey! Can we come in? Yes, come in. I think he'll answer this time. Please answer... It's closed. How will we get to it? Don't you have an idea? It's ringing! Finally! - Hilda! - Michaël! Intrusion! There! Danger, danger! Don't move. I'll go see. Danger! Ouch! It's child's play, right, Ike? Yes. The boss will be happy, for once. I won't regret that. Oh, no! Horrible bugs! Oh gosh! Hey, what...? The devil is here. I can't believe it! I won't let this happen! You're going to come in useful, for once. Thanks, Daddy! What would I do without you? Dolo, Dolo, the people will kill you! Ma'am, we've reached point 0. Attilem is no longer making profits. Okay, go! Buy Attilox Hilda! Hilda! Shh, don't say anything. No way. No way! Look, our neighbors have mowed their lawn. Yup. Too bad the moles made a mess of it. Yeah, forget solidarity! The president is waiting. He's early. Ultra-rich, sweetie! Ultra-mega-rich! Screen... tell me, who is the richest woman ever? It's me! Yes, it's me. It's me!! Not one plant remains. Oh! Life is beautiful. No more allergies. I have triumphed! It's so good. Oh! My new suit! We'll get it off. Don't worry about it. It's okay, Johnson. Dolores! Can we talk? Maybe later. Not now. What will you do now? Easy. We ask ourselves... how can we keep making money in this situation? But... everything is destroyed. - Annihilated. - Look around you! Everything's destroyed. It's an unprecedented catastrophe. I know, my little bunny. We just have to plant seeds. You seem to be taking this very lightly. Not me! I'm... I'm very worried. Later on, my friend. Later. Oh, they found honey! My sweet honey! Attention, soldiers! What's with the look? This? Well, we... inhaled the thing that destroys Attilem... and this happened. Attilox? - It's hopeless. It keeps growing. - Like your dogs. Attilio! What is this? I don't know. A side-effect, maybe? "A side-effect, maybe?" Nonsense! What state did you find the greenhouse in? It's full of plants. And bees. Bad bees. Bees? Flowers! You see? I always have a solution. This is so good! Come with me! I'll show you how I will earn money now. Hey, the 2 of you! If things don't work out... you already know what to do. Operation "Desert Bumblebee." Yes, ma'am! - Come on, let's go! - Dolores! - We should really... - Later! It's all over now. You are safe. So don't panic! Have you found anything, Michaël? I've almost finished checking the air. There seems to be no pollution. The plants were very scared. I have the impression that they sent a message. Like a strange, unusual smell. Can you smell anything? Not really. I detected a stealth element, not harmful, but its exact composition is hard to define. I'm trying to understand. Well, I can smell it. Alright. - I will study the composition. - Yes. Oh! Hilda, I... Come on! What is it now? What...? Dolly! Oh! I can't believe it! You, here? I'm so happy to see you again! Mom and Dad will be even happier. I'll go get them. They must have finished their nap. Hey, not so fast. I would first like to talk with you in private. - I'm so sorry... - Let's forget the past. I came to discuss the future. I was scared something had happened to you. Oh, Dolly! Oh, my Dolly! It's really you, Dolly. Look who's with me. The president himself. The president? I hadn't recognized him with that beard. He's a great friend. He could help you. Hilda! I've found it! I found a... Dolores? Attilio? You... here? Professor Aldashin. It's a small world, isn't it? This woman was my old lab boss, and Attilio was my assistant! They're responsible for Attilem! What do you mean? You're DOLO? My own sister! Exactly, so half these greenhouses are mine. It's my inheritance. That's what you wanted. You can't get enough. You want to rob us! Hear that, Robert? By virtue of the powers in my... Stop! Michaël and I tried so hard to warn you, but you wouldn't listen. So shut it, Mr. President! What a joke. It's all your fault! Don't try to pretend! You've forgotten the poisoned perfume you gave me? - You cheap saint! - Oh! You destroyed my life! And you destroyed mine! And our parents'! Watch out for yourself, viper! You too! Spot-head! You're vicious! No, you are! You liar! You crook! Bitch! Ouch! Go on, Hilda! There we go. If you want it, you get it. I'm the strongest, right? I'm the strongest! - Look at me. - You did it on purpose! With your damn pollen! You did it again! Help! Help! With me! I'll come back! To make you suffer! Calm down, I beg you. Later! Who was that? - Do we know them? - It was nobody. Let's go in. What happened with your sister? Don't worry. I'll be back. I will do whatever I have to... but the greenhouses will be mine. Another carnage? It's about time you stopped. What did he say? I said your megalomania needs to stop now! - Me? Megalomaniac? - Yes, yes! Megalomaniac and grotesque! Grotesque? I'm surrounded by clumsy idiots, and I am grotesque? Please stop. Or I'll pee my underwear! Enough. You're ridiculous. We've heard enough. Heard enough? Well, leave. Words, words are easy. But nobody is willing to take action. You cowardly little sissy. There. Anyone else want to jump? Johnson, maybe? - Ouch. - Are you okay? I didn't mean to, but she made me so mad! She mentioned poisoned perfume. What was that about? That's where it all started. Attilem and the ensuing ecological catastrophe... It's all my fault. I am the only one to blame. Don't say such things. My sister was the opposite of me, as boisterous as I was calm. She could never be still. She ran, jumped, climbed... I wanted to be a botanist like my parents. That made Dolores mad with jealousy. When she started to mistreat the plants, I couldn't take it. It was like a game to her. So everything broke down between us. We ended up hating each other. When I was alone, I loved to mix plants and essential oils. I dreamed of making magic potions. One Christmas Eve, I decided to make some perfume for Dolores. To teach her a lesson. It smelled so good that she sprayed on a lot and spots immediately appeared on her face. It was horrible! Dolores realized I'd done it on purpose. Not knowing it had been my fault, our father was severe with her. "Enough, Dolores! "Go take a walk outside. "Come back when you've calmed down." And we never saw her again. Do you realize, Michaël? She was not even 13. The police looked everywhere. Even in the lake. My parents suffered so much! They never found out I had tried to take revenge. This was 33 years and 2 months ago. I've thought of her every day since. Oh, Hilda! Michaël, this is so hard! Oh! The president! Let's go! Move your butts, boys! We'll blow up everything! Yes, boss! Hurry up, we're leaving now! Full throttle! Go! I let her manipulate me like a child, but things will change now. Ms. Bontempelli, your plants are all that's left on Earth. Attilox killed Attilem, and made all the seeds sterile. Hear that, Hilda? The president is right. Your plants are the only ones that can save us now. The evidence speaks for itself. Da! I can smell something. Dolores is on her way! I can order the deployment of the special intervention force FSFFTPS... I mean FST... Please don't! Don't do anything. It's already a mess. There! The computer confirms. The genetic material of smells is a match. Come and see this! It's fabulous! Hello. Hilda! I found it! I found it! They talk, they talk! My little darlings really do talk! Hilda, your intuitions were exact. - Freedom! - We want to be free. Freedom. The plants have sent a capital message. Nature needs to be set free! That's crazy! They would die outside the greenhouse. Things are clear to me now. Very clear. Nature has a force that humans can't control. We must listen. Freedom! Hilda, it's urgent. Okay, I've thought about it. We'd better hurry. Come on, follow me! You have 2 minutes to get lost! After that, face the consequences! Come on! Fast! Fast! - Take your posts! - Think, Dolores! Your parents are inside. Don't you start with that! We'll send them a little commercial sample like this. Just for fun! Fire! You see? She's nuts! Quick! Climb up! There's no time to waste! Come out! Don't try to resist! Or we'll force our way in! What are they doing? Playing Tarzan, you dummy. Let's go! For freedom! Hurray! I'm counting to 3. One, two, three. Attack! Attilio! My mask! Quick, quick! Enough, Dolores! Go for a walk. Come back when you've calmed down. Dolly, Dolly. I did mean to hurt you with that perfume, but I do regret it. Please forgive me. My poor Hilda. Flowers! Do you think everything can be solved with flowers? No, I'm sorry. Vermin with petals is useless! It just enrages me! An international process was organized and DOLO was severely sentenced. This is the 1st time a court has acknowledged an environmental crime. Dolores was sentenced to 20 years in jail. The side-effects of Attilox have not disappeared. It will be long and hard, but there's still hope. The spore cloud released by the greenhouse was so active that the vegetation has grown back most spectacularly. As for me, I'm living with my boyfriend. Mom and Dad are in good shape. Every Sunday, we go to visit Dolores, who is not taking it too badly. Hey, what happened to Attilio? Okay, next! Huh? Yes. Just imagine, we've shaved our 5 millionth beard today! How is that for profit? Sorry, I can't help myself. Dear spectator, the show is almost over. But before the lights come on I'd like to add THIS: An animated film is not an ephemeral adventure. It's been 7 years since I wrote the 1st story with its small gallery of characters. The script was enriched, deconstructed, polished, melted, chiseled... with 2 other colleagues, Benoit Chieux, who also invented the film image, and Iouri Tcherenkov. Patricia Valeix also helped. Serge Besset, an old friend, composed the score. Electro-acoustics ace Samuel Sighicelli did his part... I also had the pleasure of directing Aunt Hilda! with Benoît Chieux a jack-of-all-trades who worked on sets and decors. I personally thanked all those lovely people and feel an indescribable joy thanks to them. My assistant François Lignier was with me throughout. Susanne Seidel directed the animation wisely, so the film owes her a lot. And we owe the "acting" to our talented animators. The decors were drawn and painted with fruition, and the character colors were born from futuristic minds, wisely guided and enlightened by Maryse Tuzi, a great organizer of color allegories. Venerable magician of images and effects, Benoît Razy. Digital witch, Izu Troin. The scissors and glue were handled by the editors. The sound was conceived by god Loïc Burkhardt. Acoustic ranting and dubbing also. The sound stream was produced by the mixers. Subtitles: ECLAIR Thanks for having read all the credits. Hugs to you all. Jacques-Rémy Girerd Director and Producer
