- Alex take a bite of this. - Drink this. - Listen to this. - Brace yourself for this one. - Come on. "All tourist traffic across the bay to Alcatraz Island "was halted this morning by the US Force Service "in the wake of a bizarre episode "which occurred on the island, "just before the last tour group "was supposed to return to shore, "yesterday afternoon around sunset. "Among the casual sightseers "were members of the rock group Bodybag. "Bodybag who apparently separated themselves "from the rest of the tour group." You read the rest. - "To the considerable shock and horror "of other members of the party, "the mangled remains of the group members "were discovered outside the main cell block "shortly before the boat was scheduled to leave. "Inside the cell block, the remains of "the lead singer of the group Sammy Mitchell were discovered "hanging from a fire sprinkler pipe by her own belt. "Authorities consider Mitchell's death a suicide, "the culmination of a violent drug related rampage. "A final statement will be forthcoming, pending an autopsy." - You know, I never noticed before but you have a lovely speaking voice. - Think about it Alex, you said the place looked like some kind of prison? - So? - So maybe there's some kind of connection? - Yeah, it makes sense in a twisted sort of way. - Yeah but this has been happening to me for better than a week now. - Okay, okay, in Business Law this morning Brian made some crack - Hey. Hey! - About a dead rock star doing a concert in hell. I didn't know what he was talking about but when he explained it to me, I made the connection with my favorite raving room mate. - We just now stole this paper from the library. - Check the date, it makes sense. - Sense”? Come on think about it. - I'd love to hear a better explanation Alex. - I'm going crazy and should have pieces of my brain removed with a trowel. - I think maybe you should have another talk with that lady doctor. - Oh man I can't. She's scarier than the dreams are. - Look Alex, you live in a small house, the walls aren't a lot thicker than erasable typewriter paper. Look at me, when you don't get any sleep, we don't get any sleep. - If I don't get any sleep, I'm gonna fail my mid-term tomorrow. Which will shoot the shit out of my grade point average, which will keep me from getting into dental school and then for the rest of my life I'll be stuck sleeping in the gutter with guys like him. Do you wanna be responsible for that? I don't think so. - Look you guys. I'll try. - He'll try. - How do I look? - Even the small percentage of male hormones in my body tingle just to be near you. - I hope Richard's do the same. - Oh that might be dangerous, he certainly has got a lot more of them. You may have to call the paramedics. - You know, speaking of tingling, Alex might do some of his own if you lost a couple of pounds of sweaters. - Well, first things first, let's just introduce him to the concept of my existence. - Okay. Hello! Anybody home? Richard. Richard. Richard! Richard. Hi honey, I'm home. - Oh Alex, Alex, Alex. Looks like my little brother the repeated sex offender gonna claim another victim. - Come on Richard, every one of those girls swore she was 18. - All 13 of them? - Each of every one had a very trusting face. - And a very giving... - Nature, right. - This place looks like it was decorated by Charlie Manson. - Relax Jan this is clean for these guys. - Okay, okay, so interior decorating is a bit of low priority around here. So is our tolerance for constructive criticism. - Sorry, it's just that with all this I honestly thought something horrible had happened. - Actually you can do me a favor? Somewhere to sleep? - Well then Alex say thank you to Jan. - Hey I remember you. Weren't you in my deviant behavior class? - Oh I suppose this is a field trip. - Um Richard, last time I was here I think I lost an earring. It may have fallen behind your dresser. Do me a favor and pull it out so I can take a look. - I don't wanna move no dresser right now. - Yes you do. - Wee. - Come on, let's sit down. - Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, I thought... - Forget about the earring. - Hey, what about? - Do your little brother a favor, leave the two of 'em alone for a while. Besides you know I how I get off when it's dangerous. - Huh? Were you actually eating this? - I wonder if they need any help moving that dresser? - Are you hungry? - Does an accordion player wear a pinky ring? - I don't know. Are you hungry? Come on let's get put together by a professional. You like hamburgers? - Yeah. Oh really, my parents met on a blind date. If that wasn't enough, it was a blind date on Friday the 13th. God, with that kind of start it's amazing they've stayed married as long as they have. 27 years this February. You know what else is amazing? When my mom was the same age as I am right now she had a husband, two children and me on the way. Things sure were a lot different back then. I mean, it's just what you did. I don't think I could handle all that though. I mean look at the way all of us turned out. - You know what I found out? She's 63 years old. - Three of us girls and not one of us married. It's amazing. I guess we all sort of over-reacted to all that. - He starts turning them and twisting them, like knobs. And he says... - My sister, my older sister, Chris, she lives up in Canada and she's a veterinary. She tracks polar bears up in the Yukon territory. - His explanation sounded more biological than mechanical. - Isn't that amazing? She's just this little thing. But isn't that the bravest thing you've ever heard of. My other sister, Denise. - It's got this hair growing out the back of his mouth. - She's the premiere ambulance chaser in the city. She's just tough as nails. She does personal injury law, that's no place for the weak of heart. She spends about her life in court and the other half on the phone threatening to take people to court. As far as I'm concerned though, ah, there's so much that I wanna do. It's like my sisters have been the center of... I just hope I can live up to the kind of faith that they have in me. I hope I can make the right choices. And I think are real proud of us though... Itching to get his hands on at least one grandchild. He jokes about it all the time. Like if we're all in the same room he'll go "what is that noise I'm hearing?" - 'Cause you're coming in all fuzzy. - He assaulted the sheriff. - Are you okay? - Really disgusting. - Check. - Alex? Alex are you okay? - Yeah. - Okay. - You're a wuss, you can't serve, you're slow and you can't volley. You caused us to lose today. - Yeah but I have good court presence. - But really Jack, seriously you've gotta stop being afraid to charge the net. - I'm not afraid to charge the net. - It's just a fuzzy, cute green little tennis ball. - Not a 110 miles an hour. It turns into a blazing cue ball. - What are you worried about? Just hold the racket out in front of you. - Worried about? If this ball hits these balls, I'm gonna talk like Flipper for the rest of my life. - Would you believe when I first met her she was seriously thinking about entering a convent? Our lady of perpetual motion. - No. - So where have you two been? - Fighting communism. - That sounds marvy. - We went out for burgers and it was marvy. - God I'm having fun. Really I am and I'd like to stay and have some more, but I have two choices left in my life. Do I lapse here into a brain dead coma, or do I drag myself into my room and do my drooling in there. - Come on you guys, don't crash out now. Stay up with me. Maybe there's something good on TV? - Forget it. I'm so exhausted I'm numb. - Oh I can feel it in my bones. My spinal chord is starting to dissolve. I have to sleep now. - Beep. Clear. Now. Hey here's where all the fruit loops went. - Hey let's try something new. Let's actually sleep together. - That's the least perverted suggestion you've ever made. - Sorry. I'm tired of having to fight for the covers. Besides I only like to wrestle in bed when I'm awake. - Thanks for dinner. Maybe I'll see you in class tomorrow? - Sure. - Lock the door behind you okay? - You must be joking, are you afraid someone's gonna steal your cobwebs? - For your information little lady, these are very valuable family heirlooms. We are directly descended from the first slav's who came over on the Mayflower. - Sure, okay, goodnight. - Goodnight. - A mystery. - You're not going to bed are you? - Look man, I'm beat. Wake me if you need anything okay? - Boy I hope you used bleach. Hey come on, take a joke. Maybe this is just a phase you're going through? Are you worried about anything in particular? Only being locked in a padded cell the rest of my natural life. - Come on, besides that. Look I'm just trying to help you out. Maybe it's your hormones or your diet or something? You're not crazy so there's gotta be a logical explanation for all of this. - Have you ever had dreams like these? - Hell no. - I guess that rules out the genetic factor doesn't it? - When the hell did you get all these marks on your neck? - I'm late for class okay. - Hey wait, wait. - Was much more instrumental in the reception and transmission of electro-static charges. Previously images were held to be derived from some outside source and projected a broad spectrum, a wavelength. But this theory holds that images are really biologically generated manifestations of the subconscious that surrounds our conscious self. Much like the magnetic field which surrounds any moving electrical current. And it the hypothalamus that acts as the... - I always thought that guy was weird. This material's not that hard. - What's his problem? - I told him not to have that meatball for lunch. - Come on and get a beer. - Come on Alex, they're just dreams. Forget about it. It can't be all that bad. - Look at me, my hands are shaking, I've lost 10 pounds. I haven't had a good nights sleep in weeks, I'm so tired I feel like I have barbecue sauce for blood. - Barbecue sauce? - Yeah smokey and hickory to be exact. - Come on, you look good 10 pounds lighter. I mean, it makes your face look thinner. - Maybe I should write a book huh? How to lose weight and your mind at the same time diet. - Look, I'm gonna camp out on your couch tonight. - No look, you don't have to do that. - No I want to. Do you have some sweats or something I can borrow? - Sure. - So he chased me out of a window naked with a baseball bat. - You're kidding me. - Ned, Ned. What's the name of that song? - Take care of the fat lady. It's a new song by Sammy Mitchell, she completely sold out. What's the matter with that guy? - Ball marks. - What the hell is wrong with him? - I don't know. We were just talking and he just got up and left. - He's turning into roommate from hell. - At Celozzi's Chevrolet in Elmhurst at York and Roosevelt Road - Where you always save more money. - Hi. - Can I help you? - I'm sorry I should've called before I came, but I'm in somewhat of a hurry. Is Alex here? - Well sure, he's sleeping right now but I could. - Do you smell smoke? - Yeah. - Oh my god! - Alex! - Oh shit! - Alex! - Oh my god. - Alex. - Oh my god. - Alex! Are you okay? - What happened? - Come on. - Look nothings even been burned. - I had to do a lot of digging around, but it was worth it. This is it. This explains everything. Was this what you saw? - I only took your class because I figured it would be an easy A. Introduction to Psychokinesis. Well I feel now that I've been sufficiently introduced to your field and I'd like your permission to drop it. - But Alex, you don't wanna do that. Not now. - Look Caroline, I'm serious. - So am I. Look at this. I thought so. - I can't be sure. It's a little hard to tell within veins between his teeth. - Ever since you first told me about your dreams I've had this manuscript on my mind. It was discovered around the turn of the century and buried on Alcatraz. - Come on Jan, let's get out of here. - Alex, why don't you even try to help yourself? Are you crazy? - Yes I am. - Alex, this books contains the writings of Indian medicine men. And there's a story in here about a white man who stole their secrets and used it to enslave them. - Yeah, yeah and help 'em out with his new high protein diet. - This is when the island was a calvary outpost. Strange reports began coming back about wild orgies and unexplained disappearances. And then one night it all ended in a gigantic fire and the commandant of the fort was killed. The government just decided to abandon the place, it wasn't until later that it was turned into a prison. Does any of this sound familiar to you? - Why is Alex seeing all this in his dreams? - I don't know. But I've got a pretty good idea how to put a stop to it. I don't think you're gonna like it though. - Why not? It's been a laugh a minute so far. - You have to confront it. Let me take you to Alcatraz. - And do what? Point to my throat and shout "come out and get it!" - I think it's the only way to put a stop to it. - Why do I have to go to him? He's obviously been gracious enough to come to me. - What you're seeing are only images. He's trapped on an island, spirits can't cross over water. - Oh yeah of course, now why didn't I think of that. - Alex you're gonna have to be strong. You've got to take this information you've been given and do something with it. - I don't think so. - Alex. Your bed was on fire. I'm scared. I think you should do what she says. - For some reason you have been chosen. This is a message of some kind. There must be a reason. Why now? Why you? And what for? - Look, I don't care. You're the only one who seems to care. So why don't you go out and have these goddamn dreams. - I wish I could. I would love to have an experience like this. - You're nuts. You don't even know what it's like. - I've spent my whole life studying and investigating things like this and people like you. For once I'd like to see what it's like myself. - Alex, things like this don't happen by accident. - Congratulations on being present at this historical moment. - Why are you fighting this? - Because I'm scared. Okay. All I've gotten out of this is a slamming headache, not to mention a shaky stomach. I'm getting out of here. - Where are you going? - Home. I think I'll eat something cold out of a can and lie awake all night. - Jan, call me if anything happens. - Richard. Richard. Richard. Richard! Richard! - Yes. - No, no. - Alex! - Just get out of here come on. - What's happening to him? - Alex, look I've heard of light sleepers before but this is ridiculous. - Alcatraz? - I'm sure of it. The prison image is just too strong for it to be a coincidence. And so that's where I think these dreams are coming from. - Excuse me lady, but it's always been my experience that dreams don't involve so much audience participation. - Right. It looks to me like Alex isn't just dreaming. He's haunted. - No shit, shall we call a priest or what? - Let me tell you guys something right now. His head starts spinning around, I'm outta here. - The power of Christ compels you. The power of Christ compels you. The power of Christ compels you. - Come on you guys take it easy. It's not gonna help anything if we're all... - Hey this stuff isn't like herpes is it? I mean you can't catch it from drinking from the same glass or anything, can we? - I don't believe this. Five minutes ago we're in his room, watching him float around the ceiling, now listen to you. You just tell me whatever it is we have to do to help him. I'll do it. - For some reason Alex is being called to Alcatraz. I think he's only a vessel. A means of sending a message. - I say we drive a stake right through his heart and get it over with right now. - Oh that's a mature attitude. - Yeah, I'd like to live long enough to get mature, okay. - Redwoods don't live that long. - Okay, okay. Look, first thing tomorrow I'll take a boat over to the island and have a look around. That satisfy you? - I don't think you should wait that long. - What do you mean? You mean right now? Tonight? - Who knows what's gonna happen next. It gets worse every time. You've got to put a stop to it now. - But how? - I know I shouldn't be telling you this. My old man, my old man's got a little fishing boat. - Hey where are we gonna tie up? - Some place a little less exposed. Can you slow us down a little now Jack? Right there, in that little cove. Nobody should see us in there. - Okay. Here I am. - Well, let's climb to the top of the hill and look around. - For what? - Anything that grips you. Come on, let's get this the hell over with. - If I would've know we were gonna go mountain climbing I would have bought my rope. - Shouldn't we at least have bought some silver bullets or garlic or something? - Stop it, now I'm hungry too. - I've still got some of those fruit loops I found in the carpet. - Shh. Come on. - Alex are you okay? - I still have all my limbs if that's what you mean. - Look, are you sure we have to do this now? Can't we do this tomorrow, when it's daylight, with about a hundred of our friends? - Yeah, with guns and bombs, landmines and helicopters. - Sure you guys, I'm sure we could round up a whole heap of people, simply by telling them that we found Alex in his bedroom, lazily floating six feet in the air. - Come on, this won't take long. We'll just see what we're here to see and then hop back in the boat and do a little trow on the way back in. We'll be done in no time. Come on, I mean you're having fun so far, aren't you? - Wow, so this is it huh? - This is much spookier than I ever even pictured it. - It sure is. - This place gives me the creeps. - Places where people suffer and die always give me the creeps. - Caroline, do you know what we're looking for? - I think so. That book was written a long time ago and a lot of things on this island have changed. None of this was even here then. We're just gonna have to do some looking around. - Great, it's such a lovely evening for a stroll. - Well, let's get it over with then. - I do believe in spooks. I do believe in spooks. I do, I do, I do, I do believe in spooks. Spooky. - Shh. - Stay close and follow me. - And not that close. Hey bush. Oh lady. Hey guys it gets any colder out out here, we'll just Krista's nipples to point the way. - Don't you ever get serious? - Only when he's dead. - Asshole. - This looks like it's open. - Look out! Are you all right. - It's okay, it was just a door okay. - No shit. - Come on let's go. - It's not like I know my way around this place. But between that old manuscript and some of the maps I've seen, I have a hunch what we're looking for is in the main cell block. Which I think is this way. - Up the stairs, down the stairs. Where the hell is this bitch taking us Marty? - Just stick to the program and quit you're whining will ya? - Oh boy this is just lovely. At least all this moisture will keep my skin moist. - Oh brother, can't you pick a better breed of friends? - Don't worry about it, he needs help. - This looks like it. Let's see what's in here. Okay, look for a door, any stairs leading down. The book says that they buried him somewhere around here. It's just our luck that the government had to come along and put a big building right on top of him. - This is place homely. It's the kind of place I'd like to do 15 to 20. - I definitely agree. Just a lovely atmosphere, so relaxing. I say we hit the bar first and try to get a quick nine holes before we go home. - Nice acoustics too. - Right you are Alex. No spooky echoes in here. - Shh. - What gives? - Hey you guys. God it's me, take it easy. - You almost gave me whiplash. - Where's there a lawyer when you need one? - Come on cut it out guys, huh. - Over here, take a look at this. This damage looks very recent. And this door hasn't been used for a long time. - Until now. - Yep, just the kind of place I'd hang out if I was a monster. - Well, looks like a good place to start. - Yeah, it's a good place to start when considering just what the hell you hope to accomplish here. Look lady anything that can do that to a steel door isn't gonna wanna sit down and sip tea and have a pleasant conversation with a lovely group of kids from across the bay. - Jack! Think about it, we're already here. If anything's gonna happen, what's the difference if it happens down there or up on the roof? We're here to help Alex. Well at least most of us are. - Okay then Johnny Adventure after you. - Look Caroline, I really don't know about this. - I do. - Forget it. - Oh come on big scary guy. - Stop beating down the backside will you? - Is this art deco? It's not too late to bail out. - Well this is definitely it. - What? - The place messier than our house. - Okay, so your place is only messiest place I've ever seen without a dirt floor. - Oh come on, at least our lights work. Not to mention our phone in case we've gotta call for help. - Look, over here, help me. - What the hell is this? Richard. Richard! Oh come on you guys. Hey Richard, come on please! Please Richard help me, I'm down here, I'm stuck. - Remember the dreams Alex, the dreams. - Richard, come on Richard, this isn't funny. Jan! Marty! Come on you guys. - I only wanted to keep you around here to help you figure out what was going on. - Wait a minute, what the hell's happening here? - Just because you're psychic doesn't necessarily mean you're intelligent. - Who are you? - Honey, it's not me you have to worry about, he's here. - Who's here? - You know who and he's not in a good mood. - Richard! - Uh oh. - What's uh oh? - Someone beat us to it. - That's definitely not good news. - That explains the door. Somebody let him out. - Somebody let who out? - Somebody let me out right now. - Alex can you feel anything? Are you getting any messages? - I'm getting an urgent message from my ass to get it the hell out of here. - Alex, where are you? - Where are you? - Let me help you. - Let's get her outside. - Let's get all of us outside. - Just get her some air. Alex! - Richard? Richard come on. I'm hungry. - No. No. Stop. Stop it! No. - I know you. But you can't be. She's dead. - Bingo. Recognize this? - Hey, where's that coming from? That's the tune I made up in my dreams. - Wrong. The only way that I could airmail those images to you that you thought were your dreams, was to bring them to life with something of my own soul. I wrote, produced and directed those dreams. It's my music. - Stop me if I'm getting this wrong. You're dead and you're lonely. I'm sorry but I think I'm the wrong guy for you. Why don't you go out and get a pet or something? - Pet? Look, okay, okay, I'm sorry. This is all my fault. Don't ask me why, my whole life long I've been completely fascinated by death and the occult and all that crap. - Not surprising from a girl who decorates a stage with real cadavers. - Look take it from me, death ain't shit. Life is a gift. Oh Alex. Alex, I've got a big mess on my hands. That monster that I let loose. It's indestructible. - Yeah, I'd say it's a pretty big mess. - The living essence of everyone that the demon has killed is trapped here on this island by his power. All those souls are the source of his power and the only way to destroy him is to set us all free. - No problem, but could you first elaborate more on these indestructible powers? - By inviting his power inside himself, he gave an opening into our world for a lot more than he ever imagined. This thing which overtook him is pure evil. - So why me? - Because only a living thing can open that door that I showed at the end of the tunnel and release all that captive energy. It's a clue I did not have when I was still alive. - I don't believe you. - Alex, lie down. - What for? - We've got to ditch your body. - I like this body and I'd liked to keep it if it's all the same with you. - Trust me. - Oh yeah, sure, sure. I'll just lie down here in the dirt so me and my pal the dead girl can go and party with some of her dead friends, perfect. - Don't be as stupid and as selfish as I was. Please. - Okay. Impress me. - I'm done, that's it. I'm not playing Johnny Adventure anymore. Marty I'm going home, I'm in the boat, I'm going home. - Hey, hey, hey. Where's Richard? - Richard? - Oh no that's two. - Richard! There he is. - Richard! Richard. Richard! - Krista. - I hope he's found Alex. - That's probably where he's been. - I'm gonna go get him, I'll be right back. - Hurry up. - Wait for me. Richard. Richard. Richard. - Come in here, now. - What the hell am I doing here freezing my nuts off. - Shh. Shh. - Richard where were you? I was so scared, I couldn't stand it. I wanna go home. Please just take me home. Please take me home. No. Please honey let's go. No. - What the hell was that? - Don't you think we should do something? - No. - Come on. - It's Richard, he's crazy. He's flipping out! - He's flipping out? I'm flipping out. Come on you guys, let's get the hell out of here. Richard where are you going? Richard, come on. Richard! Richard where the heck have you been? We've been looking all over for you. - Jack, no, that's not Richard. - What are you talking about? Hey, hey, hey buddy. Come on man. It's me Jack. We're buddy's, remember we live in the same house? We slept together? Shit. - What was that? - Come on! - I need a hair cut. - How do you feel? - Pretty numb I guess. - Good, that's close enough to what it really feels like. We ought to be able to move pretty quickly now. Relax just watch. This is Colonel Mordecai G. Langston, and this is what he looked like when he wasn't do cosmetic surgery with his molars. - Are those two girls? - Yeah you got it, right after desert. Of course they thought they were coming to dinner, but they didn't know they were gonna be his main course. The commandant had a real passion for good food, good wine and bad girls. As you can see this guy just got sicker and sicker and he began to enjoy torturing these locals. He went completely crazy with his new powers. Towards the end he fed exclusively on the flesh of living beings. He imported hookers on a one way ticket until the word got out about his dining habits. Consequently his love life took a real beating. So he took to picking off the general populous of the locals until just too many Indians disappeared just too fast. And eventually they got tired of his act and they barbecued him. Burning him was designed to rid them of them of his evil forever. But what they hadn't counted on was that the old man had learned enough magic to make a pact with the devil. And the only way to find out his little scam is to get shredded and live the clue first hand. - Tell me about it. - What the hell are you doing here? You're not... - Signed, sealed and delivered. That shit head got me in the cellar, ripped my soul right out of my body and bangola, jumped right in. - But Richard you can't be? - Oh Alex come on, it's not your fault. - Oh like hell it isn't. If it wasn't for all this shit, I'd still have a brother. Who I happen to like a lot. - The way I see it, I still have a brother who I happen to like a lot and I wouldn't wanna see anything bad happen to him. Let us help you, just do what the lady says. Look as a going away present, how about you just get me the hell off this island. - May I suggest that you get your ass in gear before any more friends of yours wind up down here floating in the breeze. - Well, you weren't all that goddamn concerned about your own friends. - "Come on guys, let's take the boat to Alcatraz, "it'll be a blast." - Hey Sammy, I have this little itch right here on my throat do me a favor, scratch it with your teeth. - Look you guys, I said I was sorry. What more do you want? - The apology is quite enough. I couldn't ask for anything, really. - What happened to you guys? - Cut myself shaving. - Well how come they don't look like you? - Because we were possessed, they were... - Treated like a goddamn salad bar. Well we've be off now, bopping around this rock for the rest of eternity. - Okay, okay. So this is how spend most of my time. I was compulsive, I was a dumb shit. So what? At least I didn't do drugs, that shit will kill ya. Well there were several references in the old books that I read about this manuscript that had been found on Alcatraz. And it wasn't easy, but after months of snooping around in libraries, I finally got lucky. And let me tell you, all that dust and boredom was well worth it. That all book was just packed with great stuff. Tricks, smells, myths, legends, everything a girl could want. And I also found a story in there that said that the ashes of this powerful big league sorcerer were buried in a secret place on the island. His burial urn was placed amongst symbols of great power, because even his ashes were supposed to be still very dangerous. So armed with the invaluable skills I picked up as a juvenile delinquent, I set out to dig him and do lunch. - Well of course, naturally. Just what I would've done. I hear the words evil and dangerous and sprint right in their direction. - So get a lawyer and sue me. - If we all wind up in hell, I'll be able to get an army of lawyers. - Look, let's be honest with each other for a second. I never really believed that any of this hocus pocus actually works. - What is it with some people? I mean you tell them that's the fire is hot and they won't believe you until they reach in and get their fingers burnt. - Even so, I didn't actually learn any tricks from reading all those books. - Now it's up to you little brother. There's an awful lot of us counting on you. - So if you don't mind, we have just a few simplistic instructions for you to follow. - Alex. - Shh. We don't want that thing to find us. - Look Alex has been gone for a long time. Maybe he's stuck in a hole or something. I can't believe we're gonna go looking for him. - We'll just have to look for him very carefully and quietly because I wanna get the hell out of here. Just a rat. - Guys listen to this, you'll never guess where I've been. I met this lady and she told me everything that was going on. - Oh god. - Get off her. Come on. - Krista! - Follow her. I'll get Caroline. Caroline. - It was so horrible. - Shh. - He just grabbed her arm. - Okay, she's gonna be fine. - Please don't say that, Alex she's dead! - Caroline come back, there's nothing anybody could've done about this. - I never should've bought you here. It's my fault. It's my fault. - No but Caroline. It was very important that I come here. I met someone and what she told me proves that you were right all along. - I don't understand who is she? - Well first of all, she's the one that accidentally set the commandant free. - What? - And second of all, she's dead. - We've gotta get out of here. We've gotta get away from that thing. - It's okay. - Right away Jan. Right away. Come on now, we'll find Alex and Caroline and we'll go home okay? - All right, I think they were heading for the other cell block. - No, I don't wanna go back inside. - Okay, okay we'll follow this path come on. We'll follow this path. - She was the one that sent me the dreams. It was her music too. - Alex, you're not making any sense. A dead walking rock star is the one who started all this? - If I just do what I told you, she promises it will finish off the commandant once and for all. - It does a certain metaphysical logic. - Does that mean you think it'll work? - Well I suppose so as long as you... - Great, great, great. Let's find the others... - Wait a minute hot shot. What are you gonna use to torch him? This guys gotta be burned. - I haven't gotten that far, I got a little sidetracked. - Alex, what are you doing? - Is that what you call it? It was the lead story on the front page of my life. That's all. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean for that to happen. - Alex, is she here? Are you talking to her? - Beautiful co-ed slashed by possessed boyfriend, film at 11. - Look, I tried to warn you. I only just found out what was going on. - What does she look like? Can you see through her? - I beg your pardon? You've got a lot to learn about being dead lady. - The whole point is to prevent her from learning about it tonight. - And that's up to you buddy. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's not complicate matters any more than they already are. I know Alex a little better than you do, I've seen his SAT scores. There's never going to a request for a donation from the Nobel Prize sperm bank. - Don't hold back, go ahead tell me how you really feel. - Alex are there more than one of them now? - There's at least two too many. - I'd just hate to see you served up buffet style like the rest of us were. - Why do I get the feeling that for some reason you still think this is my fault? - The way I see it, if it wasn't for you I wouldn't have wasted my money on all this new dental work. - Yeah and a lot of good this perm and highlights is gonna do me this summer. Alex, I think you owe us one. - Is eternal rest so much to ask? - It is in that tone of voice. - May I suggest the cans in the utility shed behind the guard house. Anybody got any matches? - I've got a lighter in my pocket, had a lighter in my pocket. - Then it's probably still there. - Then why don't you make her pocket your first stop on the way to the shed. - And don't go looking for anything else while you're there. - Oh that's disgusting. - Ha, I've heard too many stories about you fraternity boys to take any chances. - I sure don't know where we're going. Do you know where we're going? - I was following you. - Great, great. Not only is it dark and foggy and cold, but we're lost too. Running around like this, I feel like Larry and Moe trying to put out a fair in Curly"s pants. - You lost it guy. - Okay you guys, we've gotta keep moving. - You're probably right. Let's just go back to that building we passed a little while ago. - That's not a good idea. Jack is not gonna do that. Jack wants to go back to the boat. Come on guys, it's not a bad boat. Let's go to the boat, remember the boat. I want the boat. - Run, run! Run! Come on, go. He's dead. - Shh. - Can't stop. He's coming. - I heard the screams are you okay? - He's coming, run. - Where's Jack and Marty? - Jack? Jack's. Jacks. - No. - If Jan and I go down to the shed to get the gas can can you get Krista's lighter and meet us back here? - I'll try. - Okay, go ahead. We got lucky. Those dummies forgot to lock the place up. Carry these down to the old chapel, I have to go. - What the hell are you talking about? - Look, it's time for me to do what I came here to do. - Alex. - Jan. Trust me. - Don't do anything I wouldn't do. - I won't if you won't. Go ahead. - Not that way you dumb shit. - Jack. - Well I hope you're happy? I'm happy. - Jesus Jack, Jan told me that you... - Yeah well Marty told me to pass on his best wishes. He really wanted to be here you know, but he's so embarrassed 'cause, well you know how much he hates to go out in public with his brains through the back of his skill. - Look buddy, I really am sorry about all of this. - Yeah look, I don't wanna say I told you so. But I told you so. - Jack, I'm sorry but I really have to... - Alex, Alex, Alex. In 10 seconds your brother's body's gonna play slice and dice with Caroline in the main cell block. So get your ass over there. No, no, no, no, no, that way. Ah shit. - Marty! - Hey asshole, why don't you pick on somebody your own size? - Do not interfere. - What are you gonna do? Kill me. - Wasn't once enough for you? - Typical. Never think of my needs. - Run. - You heard her, run! To the chapel. - Come on, let's get going. It's show time. - Caroline are you all right? - Marty's dead. - Oh my god. - Jan. Jan, he's gonna be here any second. Wait inside and find something to hit it with over the head. After I get him in the door. We're gonna burn his ass. Come and get it fucker. - You know what to do. The door at the end of the tunnel. The top of the stairs, you push it open and it's all over. We're free. - I think I have something you're looking for. - You've been reading that old book of fairytales haven't you? Just like that other slut. - I don't know what you're talking about. - I could rip you apart and eat you alive. - Hold onto that last thought. You're right, I have been a naughty girl. I read that book. And I know all about your power and your strength. You could do whatever you wanted to me and I wouldn't sto you. Do it now. - I just love a party. You. Come here. No. No. - Dammit. - No! - Get him. - Jan! Go. - No! - Caroline! Caroline! - Good work cowboy. - Is he? - Relax, it's over, you did it. That means that I've gotta go to now. - Wait. - Alex listen, I don't have much time left and I am very, very grateful to you. Nobody has ever trusted me or helped me out the way that you have. - Well you have to admit, up until now you haven't exactly been the girl next door. - I know, but I wanna fix that now. I have one last favor to ask of you. For old times sake. And this might work out pretty good for both of us. - Wait a minute. - Shh. This one's fun. - Your sister has a nice place. - I hope you're hungry. I've got a ton of food in there. - For sure. - Hey I didn't know you played the piano. - I don't. ♫ Ooh yeah ♫ Oh ♫ Ooh yes oh yes ♫ Ooh yeah ♫ I heard voices from the other side ♫ I saw faces filled with pride ♫ I felt the things that I left inside ♫ I see the final lover come ♫ I am the only one ♫ I am the only one ♫ You live life alone ♫ I am the only one ♫ But when you see ♫ The final lovers go ♫ I am the only one ♫ The only one ♫ I am the only one ♫ You live your life alone ♫ I am the only one ♫ But when you see ♫ The final lovers go ♫ I lost count of the days gone by ♫ I looked forward to another try ♫ Strapped into a fateful lie ♫ I see the final lovers come ♫ I am the only one ♫ The only one ♫ I am the only one ♫ You live your life alone ♫ I am the only one ♫ And when you see ♫ The final lovers go ♫ I tried to throw a tussle with the rain ♫ Planned for a tomorrow that never came ♫ Until the day that it was never the same ♫ It's good to know where you come from ♫ I am the only one ♫ Oh yes, oh yes-ah ♫ Get outta my way ♫ I am the only one ♫ I am the only one ♫ You live your life alone ♫ I am the only one ♫ But when you see ♫ The final lovers go ♫ I am the only one ♫The only one ♫ I am the only one ♫ You live your life alone ♫ I am the only one ♫ But when you see ♫ The final lovers come ♫ I am the only one ♫ The only one ♫ I am the only one ♫ You live your life alone ♫ I am the only one ♫ But when you see ♫ The final lovers come
