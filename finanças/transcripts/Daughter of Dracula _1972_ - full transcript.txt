Anchored on a cliff on the seashore is located the Castle Karlstein that seems to defy all elements. It was inhabited by sinister count Dracula. During many years this man spread terror over the whole shire. The memories of this horror faded over the years and became legend. But... You did well to inform us, Miss Edith. We came as fast as we could. But I have a bad feeling. - She will come soon. - I can't stand it anymore. I will welcome her. How is she now? There you are. I was worried that you would come too late. - How is she? - Very bad. She's expecting you. You are Louisa, my cousin. My daughter. My child. Tell them to leave us alone, please, they must go. My mother wishes that you leave us alone. My beloved child, you are the direct descendant of the counts of Karlstein. Louisa, before I die I want to entrust you with something that I have always kept as a secret. That's why I had to talk to you. I can't take this secret to the grave. The chamber of the single tower in the north has not been entered since the death of your father. You have to see it, Louisa. It has to be, you have to know, now that I'm dying. The key is there, take it, take it... go. Most of all, my child, be brave and prepare to see horrible things, yes, horrible things. There is also a chapel and underneath there's a tomb, where the first count dwells. The first count was a vampire... yes, a vampire. - You looking very serious today. - Well, when you read such news. Don't let your tea get cold. You were up early today. On the contrary, I went late to bed. ls that what you meant? No, I didn't mean that. - Do you know if my husband already went to the castle? - No, I didn't see him. Your husband comes down. He has a strange expression, if you pardon me saying so. Margot, it seems that your employer is troubled. Who isn't troubles at the present time? Was it good? You should eat more of your breakfast. News, Jefferson? Just the daily routine. My employer is easy to satisfy, so no reason to worry. He lives for the music. After all you've told me, he's a great artist. Yes. See you tomorrow. Charlie, how are you? Very well. I think, you have a case that you will solve with your usual keenness. Good Charlie, always one for the jokes. - So, what do you think? - Not a lot. And you, inspector? I'm still at the hearing of evidence. We're secretive, that's our rule. But of course. Let me know when you have found pieces of evidence. Before this evening I have to send some lines to my magazine. These journalists. You are always in a hurry to know everything, aren't you Charlie? Are you in a hurry to find the murderer? No, I take my time. And if we would discuss everything with a drink. ...I trust you with this May I join you. Two pear liquors. That's without a doubt the speciality of the region, isn't it? - Make it full. - Like always. This is superstition. Nobody believes in those legends anymore. - But... - This is just imagination. The curse will spread over the land again. In this crime, you can't see witchcraft, let alone a vampire. I have never heard someone talk about these serious things in such a way. Supernatural powers exist in our age. You can't ignore it and definitely not make fun of it. What happened, my little Karine. Why did you scream? There was someone. A horrible person. That's nothing. It's nerves. It's normal after all you've gone through. Come on, calm yourself. Try to sleep. In the night the silence of death will surround us, just interrupted from time to time by screams of terror and horror. That's the eternal law of the mystery and terror. Where do you come from, Jefferson? From the tower. I listened through the closed doors. It is inhabited and death will rise triumphal in the moonlight. I forbid you to talk this way. You can forbid me to talk? Unfortunately no one has the power to stop the way of the blood drinking, darkness despising birds. - You play wonderfully, Louisa. - I practice. And I love the music. Wonderful. When you are here, I don't feel alone anymore. I have the feeling, the time stood still the day you went away. I had such a sorrow. We were the best friends. We still are. You've always attracted me. And at the same time you frighten me. One day we took a bird. And I plucked its eyes out with a needle. You cried in my arms. That was a strange impression. And I have the same impression since you returned... So, it seems like you've seen the murderer? No, I didn't say that. I heard screaming and on the court I've seen someone running out of Miss Dorian's room. You know, Miss Dorian always came late, but always by herself, she was a good girl. When I heard the screaming I left. There was a man running away. Did you see his face? He had a black neck-tie. I couldn't see his face. The collar of his coat stood up very high. - He hit with a cane. - Could you at least recognise this cane? Yes, it was made out of a very rare wood. It looked like an African fetish, like the ones the sorcerers of the black tribes in the movies have. And I've seen that the handle was carved like a head with eyes. - And the wood was hard. The proof... - And then? I was hit and heard the angels sing in heaven. I've lost balance. It's hard for me to remember what happened. But if I would see the cane, I would recognise it. Are you sure? Yes. Absolutely. I was hit by it. I still have the wound. Here. If I caught the offender. I would give him a very bad time. Good, you can leave. Your name? In the night of the crime you've been seen prowling on the coast side near the Majestic. - I didn't prowl, Inspector. - What did you do then? I went for a walk. - In this cold? - I love the cold. Did you enter the hotel? - Can you prove it? - I'm like everyone here. My presence wouldn't stay unnoticed. The staff can prove it. You're on the wrong path, you are wasting your time, believe me. These crimes don't have any similarities with your usual investigations. Don't start with the witchcraft and ghost stories. Who still believes in this nonsense anyway? That's ridiculous. No, the word ghost seems to have just a meaning to ignorant people. I speak of ghosts and creatures from the beyond. You are without a doubt very educated, Jefferson. And you believe in these silly things? I studied certain sciences with passion. That's why I believe in the might of the beyond and the influence it has on all of us... in its never ending creative and destructive power. So in your opinion these crimes were not committed by normal but by supernatural creatures. The curse fell on this land after the first count died in a horrible way. He lived on the blood of his servants and will do so until the end of time... if we don't find soon a way to destroy him. You've chosen the wrong profession, Jefferson. You should write unnerving novels instead of being the modest little secretary of Karlstein. For fifteen days I'm your adviser. I'm about to study this affair. I see, in this case I'm sure yesterday at the time of the crime you were on location to improve your knowledge. Yes, but also for personal reasons. Can you tell me these reasons? No, inspector, I can't do that at the moment. It's about family matters that have no meaning for you. It's you, come on in. It seems you have something to tell me. Yes, I have seen the count Karlstein yesterday evening. He doesn't go to the Majestic very often. And when Miss Dorian was done with her performance, he immediately left. - You think the count could be Miss Dorian's murderer? - No, I don't think so but... - I'm listening, Margot, talk. Tell me what you know. - The count limps and the murderer had a cane. Yes indeed, so you're making a connection between the man who hit someone down that evening and the count? The count is handicapped. He knows how to use a cane. Does this belong to you? We found this cane at yours. - If you were to intrude into honest peoples houses like burglars then... - Does it belong to you? Yes or no? Mister Karlstein, a cane is indispensable for you. Recognise it. It can just belong to you. Interesting logic. I would never have believed that an inspector could ignore the usual techniques of the police. - Where did you spend the night from 3rd to 4th February? - I can't remember. You've were seen in the Majestic, some minutes before the crime. You can't deny that. What did you do there? I can't answer you. You can go, count. - Always the same. - The police know nothing. The whole matter is unsettling. Yes, they speak of vampires, curses and witchcraft. It's obvious that the police protect us. Two beers please. The suspects are compromised. Believe me this is not a simple crime but a ritual crime. - Name? - Anna Kramer? - Profession? - I am the owner of the "HÃ´tel Du roi". - Age? - Thirty-five, since you want to know everything. The years have been kind. Excuse me, but these indiscreet questions are necessary. So, you want to reveal something about phantoms? - No. about me. - Did you come to accuse yourself of these crimes? No, I bring you the evidence that Max Karlstein is not the murderer. Wonderful but where are these evidences. He spend the night in the Majestic with me. The count is my lover. We were not for the spectacle in the Majestic. I had a date with him that evening. So, that's why he didn't want to say. We were in a bed and made love. At the time of the crime I was in Max' arms. I would like to believe you. You are a policeman, you should know that the Majestic isn't just a cabaret but also an hour hotel. Good, but would you repeat that in front of the judges? Yes. of course. It's the truth. Don't you fear this could have serious consequences for your private life? Yes, very. My husband is a strange man. If he would find out... and then he works with Max... That's what I had to tell you, inspector. I don't understand how a young and pretty woman can fall in love with a man like Karlstein. - What you think doesn't interest me. - What the policeman or that fellow thinks? - Neither of them. You are free to go. A watch, a cravat, a belt. That's all. - What is that supposed to mean? - You are free, Mister Karlstein. - Was it unfounded or did you think over your decision? - Thanks to this woman. You can go, both of you. Mrs. Kramer confided everything to me. Wait a second. I want to tell you that sometimes silence can have unpleasant consequences for a gentleman. Listen, inspector, I am sure in my place you would have acted the same way. Count Karlstein, do you have news? What's the state of the investigation? Leave me in peace. Does the inspector have a trace? ls there any evidence, testimonies? I know nothing. Please leave me in peace. Let it be. Ask the police. But I have my suspicions. May I? How nice to see you. So, does it go on? It is dangerous to play detective. If you go on, I'll lock you up for six months. I have an idea. It's the secretary. The cane maybe belongs to him. You rely too much on fantasy. I forbid you to intervene in my affairs, do you understand? I just said it like that. Calm down. - Excuse me, Miss, I would like to talk to the owner of the castle. - What about? - I am a journalist and I would like to have an interview. - I'm sorry, the owner is absent. What do you want? - Go, we don't allow anyone to enter this house. - You will be sure to inform me, Miss. - Margot, where are you going? - For a walk with friends. Pay attention. I heard you associate with eccentric people. You've were seen with a strange man the other night. Excuse me, Madam, but I am adult. I can do what I like. My private life is my own concern. OK, Margot. I just wanted to warn you. I don't want you to be hurt like that poor girl. This is your first time in this region? The nature is beautiful and wild but it's cold. On the cliff is an old, unsettling, mysterious castle. What's wrong? Nothing, I just look at you. But I'm not pretty today, Louisa. I don't agree. You're nice. - I love you, you know. - Are you sure about that? - Yes I'm sure. You will never belong to someone else. You hear me, Karine? You will never betray me. Yes, it's always like that. If this goes on, me and my wife will leave. - Patience. Don't panic. - I don't listen to what people say. Leave, that's enough. - Come on, we leave. - I don't want to hear anymore about these stories. - Did you help him? - Max? Yes. That's what I thought. What do you want to do now? Max is clone forever. I will never see him again. - But what do you want to do? - I stay here. With you. If you still want to. You stay with me because you don't see another solution, it's like that, isn't it. Perhaps with time... Yes, perhaps we could bear each other with indifference like two aged idiots. Can I stay with you? Yes. But now that I know how I have to accomplish the act of purification: To exterminate this monstrous race by the light and fire.
