Dad, I've got to go! Man, I've got to go! I've got somewhere to be, Dad! They're fucking in there. Who? Sarah and Paul. I shouldn't let anyone in. I don't like strawberry. It's raspberry. Since when have they been fucking? You fancy him or something? You're such a loser, Paul. What are you doing here? We were meant to meet up. What are you thinking? Your eyes are like pirates looking out to sea. Shit. You take it so seriously. What? I thought we'd get the guys a bit warmed up. Yeah, right. Take it off! Take it off! Take it off! Hot! Man, that's hot! Look at this! Check this scorcher out, mate! No girls. I said, no girls. You mind if I fill this up? Hold this for me? Nice porn collection you got there. I sit in the lorry all day, I've got so much time. You have your own lorry? - Nah. It's Mum's. Can I drive it sometime? - Forget it. Nobody drives it drunk. Except me. Can I come along sometime? What? You mean now? Yeah. Give me a little ride around town. If you dance for me. Right then, a spin around town. And? First time in a lorry, eh? You like it? What about that dance? Whoever laughs first has to drink. Watch this. Yeah, there, you lose. - No! No! - Take a sip. Another one. Watch this. One, two, three. You lose. Come on, you can do it. Watch this. Come on now. That was quick. Here, drink! So, will you grant a kiss to an old geezer like me? No. It's just a kiss, that's all. Come on. - OK. Hey, what was that? I'm not your granddad! - But you could be. You're a mean one! How old am I then? How old is your grandpa? A hundred. - And I'm a hundred then? You're so pretty. Come on, turn around. And do you still drink coffee? No, I can't. Because of my heart. I can't anymore. OK, your father will take you there. Right? Yeah. What happened to you... it's... Excuse me. Can I go? Then you have to sign here that you decided to be transferred into a psychiatric clinic. Take care. Do you smell the ocean? I haven't worn that for years, Dad. Your mother knew things like that. Thanks, Dad. I don't understand what's up all of a sudden. Do you want to know? For you. No thanks. There's caramel cream in it, and roasted nuts. Take it, please. Sophie! Never eat what she offers you. Come with me. We have 15 rooms and 27 patients at present. Most stay for several years. But some just stay for a short time. Going through a regimented daily therapy is sometimes sufficient. The lady you're sharing a room with, her name is Ann. You should just relax for a bit now. It's dinnertime in half an hour. Are you coming? We want to close up. Amber is often stuck under a piece of seaweed. Or under a shell. Come, let me show you something. Where are we going? Come find out. Isn't there an alarm system here? Come in. Come on! Want to dive with me? OK. Close your eyes. You see? It can happen to anyone. Are you cold? Yes, love? Mum, Nikita taught me something. - What's that? Roses are red, violets are blue, Dad's a silly fool and Mum's a big old mule! What? And you're a naughty little stinker! And you have stinky feet. Sorry? Who's the stinkiest little stinker in the world? Aren't you a little stinker! No, you are, Mummy! Not on my hair. That hurts. Lilly, not on the hair. Let go. Lilly, that hurts! Lilly, let go! That hurts! Does it still hurt? But you said you'd have it pulled! Now! I can't. Come on, do it! Do it for me! Shit! It's out. Sweet dreams of sour pickles. Ole? Can you get that please? Sis! What's wrong? Happy birthday. Come on in. Have a seat in the kitchen. He might still call. Even you don't believe that. Can you get that please? You see what I look like. Just a moment! Yeah! Hey, you're early. - Hello! Hello there. Where is the birthday girl? - She's getting ready. How are you? Hi. Nice that you came. Man, you really got yourself all prettied up. Is Ole here? Yeah, he's in... - Ole! Stine? May I come in? Want some more? - Yeah, sure. Thank you. I'd rather have a schnapps. - I'll get you one. Would you like some more? -A beer would be great. Beer. Be right back. Just a moment. -Thanks. Are you thirsty? Want a drink? - Thanks. Wow, you in a dress... Well, for the occasion... Want a bit? - Where's Lilly? She's already sleeping. You're up late. Frenja! You forgot us. Are you gonna play? Come on, you'll play, right? What about the food? - Your guests are hungry. The buffet is... Are you nervous? - A bit. Is it any better? Frenja! You can do it. Today I wanted to tell you the story about the day I turned 13 or 14, and we were together on holiday. Do you remember? And... I absolutely wanted to go to the beach alone, because all the guys were there. And our parents sent little Frenja with me as chaperone. Because they knew I was a naughty little one. But then I stepped on a wasp and of course screamed bloody murder. That was the start of my opera career. And what did Frenja do? She put me in a handcart and pulled me all the way home from the beach. And she did it so well that I was alright at the end of the ride. But Frenja was so exhausted that she broke down and didn't come out again the whole holiday. And I just wanted to say that for all these years I've been so sorry. So today I'd like to raise a glass to our Frenja and her enormous heart. Right, Ole? That's a toast. The buffet is open. Do you have a bit more wine for us? It's really delicious. - Of course. Mummy, I can't sleep. Mummy, you smell like sick. Hello. - Hi. Should we turn them over? Thanks. I'm Frenja. Leila. What's wrong? Ann's gone. Why is it so bad, that she's not in her bed? Where were you? I couldn't sleep. I've got something to smoke. Come on. Where did you get that, anyway? Whoa, I'm so dizzy. Does she look like you? I don't know. She looks like... Lilly. It was always like that. She wasn't my daughter or a part of Ole and me. She was always just Lilly. She's got a scar here. From a heart operation. She got teased about it at school. But you know what she says? It's not a scar. It's a zipper. And when she really likes someone a lot, she opens it up and gives them a bit of her love. Then she closes it up again. Sweet, huh? I've never seen her like this before. What's this spot? I don't know. It's from the old clothes collection down in the cellar. Don't you find it creepy to wear old clothes? Why? Maybe somebody died in them. I don't find that creepy. Quite the contrary. As you feel the floor, you also feel the pulse in your hands. You feel how it makes the ground tremble. How it becomes one with the environment. How it lets your whole body and the whole world around you connect and flow into each other. And your pulse becomes green, fruitful, healthy leaves, with the limbs of those laying next to you. The limbs connect with the... Perhaps you should go get a little fresh air. Here. It's like time travel. Me in 15 years. And me in 30 years. I'm looking forward to getting older. But I've gotta get out of this backwater. I didn't even get a real drag! And you shouldn't, either. I might have gotten you pregnant. So? Right, anything our princess desires. Ann! - Ann! Oh man, what are you doing? Careful, it's poisonous. You shouldn't get it in your eyes. Not at all. No! Not at all. Ann? Ann! Ann! Where are you going? Ann, where are you going? Wait! The water's coming in. We've got to go. We could restore a Ferris wheel. And then travel the whole world. And to brush our teeth at night we just go up and spit down. Let go. And Ole and Lilly? They'd come along, or what? Lilly, yeah. And Ole? Yes, sweetie, I'm much better. Yeah. Just one more night, and I'll be back. Will you give Daddy a kiss for me? I love you too. I need you guys. Stop. Stop! What is it? You're just hurting yourself. - Why? Ann's not getting healthy. What does she have, anyway? Mum? Mum? Mum! Where were you? I have this phrase in my mind. And it makes me so endlessly sad, because it gives me the feeling that everything is over now. What's the phrase? In the morning, there was still grass in front of my window. I know, Lilly needs you. What if I can't handle it again? Then imagine that we're on a green meadow. And the grass is still very damp from the night. But the sun is drying it slowly. And near us a group of calves is grazing. They're shy, but one walks over to us and stands in front of you and smells your hair. You can feel the calf's breath on your face. Then you hold your hand out and the little calf rolls its rough tongue over your hand. Thanks. If you could also be to yourself the way you were earlier with Frenja, then you would never have to be here. I'm only here because of you now. Do you promise me? What? That you'll always be that way with yourself. OK. Sweet dreams of sour pickles. What does that mean, anyway? That many things aren't as bad as they appear. Did you know that the Inuit wander out on the ice to die? When they decide their life should come to an end, they just walk out there, out to open sea. They lay down and wait to freeze to death and become a part of the sea forever. I've always asked myself when the point comes when they decide to go. Perhaps they are especially happy, and fulfilled with what lies behind them? One shouldn't miss that point.
