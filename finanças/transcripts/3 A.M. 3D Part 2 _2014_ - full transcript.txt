Rang Rang Rang, please don't kill me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Please don't take my life, Rang, spare me. Oh shit! Rang, Rang, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it, bro. Hey, what's wrong with you? Open your eyes, it's me! Boss! Played a prank on me for what? What're you talking about? If it wasn't you, then why did my nun doll disappear? Why don't you take a look? Jerk! I was in a hurry. That's why I fell on the doll. Where the hell were you, Mod? What if you strolled around and got picked up by police? I was just getting the photos for Tar. So he can finish the nun doll fast. You're right. So when will you finish, Tar? By the way, did you two see my wife? She went out for a car wash. Good. When she comes back... Tell her I went out to meet with a client. Make sure you tell the same story. And don't slack around, finish it up. Is it ruined? If there's something on your mind, you can talk to me. Better if you don't know. Otherwise, you get spooked. Hey, we gotta stick together for a long time. Just think of me as your friend. Yeah, all right. His name's Rang. He's the real deal. He is my idol. "The Third Night" Something like this, it hurts like hell. One-sided love always makes... your heart bruised. Yeah, Mom? Tar, when will you get the money? I told you. I'll handle it. I've heard this before. When will you quit mingling with those pricks? Mom, if it wasn't for Rang, I wouldn't know where else to get the money for you. Where is the money? He's already dead and you still hope to get some? I gotta go, Mom. Hey, what took you so long? Um... I just stopped for an errand. Meng, Did you reach the client? I'm trying. But Rang's the only one with the connection, So what can I do? I wonder. And now he fucking died in a car crash outta jealousy. Gotta blame Goi and Boso. I saw right through that whore from the start. She was only there for his dough. She's never true to him. And that asshole Boso. Worked for him for years, still betrayed him. Fucking prick! Rang hasn't died for 3 days and you fucked his wife? Show some respect. You know it yourself how jealous he was! Watch out, man. You gotta pay the price. I'll go pay him respect first. Then I got something to talk with you guys. Bastard. I'll beat the crap outta you some day. Calm down, bro. Jackass. Dickhead! Enough. Goi Let me go. Goi Goi Goi You, slut! Rang's calling. You hung up on me?! Goi Skank. Shit! It's the third night, he's making his power felt! It's cuz of you, Boso. You hooked up with Goi. I don't wanna cross with you guys. But what I want right now is my share of dough. Before Rang died, Goi was told that client would transfer the payment with the password. It means right now that password is in Rang's cellphone. But the police didn't give us back his cell. Before the crash, He was still calling me. It's supposed to be somewhere around there. We gotta find it. Who got the ATM card? Rang must've kept it at the shop. Here is the plan. We all go there to look for the cell. Except you, Tar. You go back to the shop and search for the card. I'm not going back alone, man. You're shitting your pants now? You want the money or not? Don't give me bullshit. So be it. Meng, I think... I don't trust both of them. Get your ass back to find that ATM card. And keep me informed. You guys go there, I'll go this way. Goi Goi Goi Goi, try calling his cell. We may hear it ring. It's been three days, The battery might be dead after him. Let's try it, first. The number you're trying to reach is not available. Please leave your message after the beep. See? Told you. Open! Tar Tar Tar Tar Whoa, Rang, Rang! You like the pattern? I keep my words, man. You work for me, I ink you. Why do you need that much money? Don't think I'm a grandpa preaching you, But this kinda work can't feed you forever. You're still young. You can do much more than this. But I wanna be like you. You're my idol. Idol? I'll tell you what, Tar. I've never thought about being anyone's role model. Just being a normal guy in this society is fine with me. But I doubt that I can. Been a long time since I quit dealing. Still, I returned to this job. Shit. You did it because of Goi, right? You must promise me that you won't stay long. When you get what you need, drop out of this. Promise? Shit! You look like you've seen a ghost. Wimp! Hey, what the...? Shit! Hey. Rang Rang Rang's calling. Goi Goi Goi Bitch! You whore! I trusted you! I love only you. Don't think that I'd spare you. What's wrong? Let's get outta here. Come on. Why so fucking hurry? Maybe they found the phone. Gonna run away with it? Son of a bitch. Jiab, come on. Sucker. Hello, whoâ€™s that? Why are you calling me? Who the hell calling me? Dumbprick! Jiab, hurry up! Rang's calling. Come on, man! Meng. Sucker. Something like this, it hurts like hell. One-sided love always makes... your heart bruised. It hurts like hell. It hurts like hell, Rang. What? The monk's coming. What? The monk's here. Whoa... Ouch! Boso, you backstabbed me! You stole her from me! Who said I stole her from you? Goi came to me, herself. The bitch said to me... She loved you no more. Liar. She loves me.

I made it come true. If I die, I have nothing to worry. By the way, What do you need if you actually die? No idea. I ran away and came to Thailand All I want is money. I wanna buy good stuff like rich people. If I were rich, I'll buy the real stuff to burn off. Then go ahead and die now. I'll burn all this joss paper to send 'em to you. So you can be rich when you're dead. Right now you're broke, man. If you two die, I'll burn the leftovers of fake items Just for you. You said you're meeting with the client. Not anymore, her husband's there. Gotta eat the leftovers again. Tar, I'm starving. Go get something for me. I'm talking to you, dumbo. Money? As usual. Got that. Shithead. Boss, the nun is Christian. Why would she need joss paper? You ask me? How the hell could I know? All the know is this nun... is goddamn powerful. Thai, Chinese, Western, Laotian, you name it. Run for life every damn time. Mod, you prick. You shouldn't have provoked me. Wanna know how fierce she is? Good. I'll tell you the story. What the heck? "The Convent" Legend has it... In the abandoned black church next to our school, There was a headless nun who shot herself to death because of love. And she continues to play the piano despite having no head. It's also said that... In late night... If you hear the sound of piano coming out of that church, It's either someone's wishing for their love Or someone's... ...dead. They said that cloistered nun... died of a broken heart. So, what is a cloistered nun? A nun who take vows of stability to church til they die, Gives up the secular world, Incessantly prays for all sins, Does her routines only in the church. No one's allowed to go in, Nor are they allowed to leave. And most importantly, You're not allowed to be in love with anyone, Apart from God. That's why everyone calls her... The Bride of God. This nun was a good bride. She always stuck to her routines. Until one day... She fell in love with somebody, an outsider. Instead of praying to God for all sins like she used to, She played the piano, Sending her love through the song to outside, Hoping that someone will hear it. As time passed, she fell deeper and deeper. Finally, her desire was fulfilled. That someone accepted her love. Wow, so romantic. But it wasn't like that. She felt guilty towards God, That she loved someone else. She lost faith in herself. She knew that she couldn't stop this forbidden love. So she made up her mind. What's next? After committing suicide, Even though her head fell off, Her hands continued to play the piano. Since she had such faith in love, Legend has it that... If someone's wishing to the headless nun, Their wishes will be granted. Sounds like Kwan, the senior student. They say she went to pray to that nun, So Tong broke up with her girlfriend And got together with her. How could that wish be granted? They were not together for so long... ...before Kwan mysteriously disappeared. Recently, Tong just dropped out of school. Don't you think it's weird? According to the legend, To wish to the headless nun, you have to go alone, Slit your palm, And place a red rose on the piano. Once you get what you want, you must go back to the church alone At 3 AM 3 AM? Yep. And you must play the same song she played til the end. No matter what you see... or experience, You must not stop In order to show your gratitude. They said on some nights the headless nun even joined. Shit. She's damn lonely. If you fail to follow these procedures, you'll be dead. Just like Kwan! Watch your mouth! She just disappeared. She didn't die. Damn, slit yourself for blood and ghosts, I'd rather be an old maid. Even if you swore, no one would take you. Ouch, that's harsh. What are you girls doing? Isn't it bedtime? Other friends have long holidays. Shit on us in dorms, Fucking extra courses. Go. Turn off the light and sleep Unless you want your holistic points be deducted. Now, Sister must be wondering... Where Kullanan is? I don't care. I'm bored to death, holed up all day long in the dorm, can't go anywhere. Hey, I've got somethin' for ya. Whoa. I was just kidding. Didn't mean for you to get the real tattoo. I know you're scared of needles. Why did you do it? Let me see, did it hurt? You're the one who told me That if I get a tattoo, You'll be my girlfriend. Will you be my girlfriend now? Really? For real? Absolutely. You can't love somebody else. You're mine. How long you been here? Why? Afraid that I caught something? Sorry. Whoa, your ex's so mean. Let her be. She's such an idiot. Easy. Why don't you get off my back already? Just cut it off. What you talking about? Don't pretend that you're innocent. What the heck did you put in my locker? Isn't it a bit too far? So there's someone who hates you more than I do. Is this yours? This kinda thing can belong to anyone. Oh yeah? But this kinda psychopath can only be you. It's over between us. Don't you get it? Just let me go. I don't love you. I love Mai. She already agreed to be my girlfriend. I didn't pull that prank on you. Just so you know. If I really wanna do it, It won't be just that. Cuz it's not enough to pay for what you've done. You can't love somebody else. You're mine. Hey, when will you get outta water? Sister will catch you like this. If we're late for the prayer, it's doomsday. Just one more lap... And I'll go back to you. Hurry up then. Ouch! To wish to the headless nun, you have to go alone, At 3 AM Slit your palm, And place a red rose on the piano. Once you get what you want, you must go back to the church alone. What's wrong, Khem? Kwan... Calm down. What happened to Kwan? What did you do? Kwan... Kwan's been killed! Kwan... I saw it. Her body's right there in the church. And why did you go there? Gosh. You believe in an urban legend? That because I love you. I don't know how to break up with Linin and be with you. I would do everything Just for you to love me. Khem... You really don't have to do this. You would love someone because you feel so. Love doesn't come just because you wish. If you really believe in it, After the prayers, I'll go with you at 3 AM Just for your peace in mind. And you'll understand. Shit! Let's go there. There's nothing here. How can it be? I really saw it. I wasn't mistaken. Perhaps it was just your imagination. Come on. Let's get this over with. Mai, Did you hear that? I heard nothing. Afraid? You're always tricky. It's 3 AM according to the legend. But you're here at 8 PM You supposed to be here alone. But no, here you are with Mai. How can one ever trust you? What is going on here? You used to fool people. Now you're being fooled and don't know what to say? Mai. What's all this? How does it feel? To do something for the one you love, but she'll never care. What's going on? I'm confused now. Mai secretly adores me since I was still together with you. She loves me so much that she can do anything. One thing I asked from her Is to be with you, To make you fall for her, So I can get my revenge. Mai, why did you do this to me? I just want you to understand. Say it to her face. So eventually Khem will understand Love doesn't come from wishing. Why did you do this to me? Why? - Just let me go. - Get off. - I don't love you. - Get off me. Let me go! Get off me. Get off me. Help! Help me! Mai! Help me, please. Khem. Khem. Finish the last note! Please let me go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You can't love somebody else. You're mine. In late night... If you hear the sound of piano coming out of that church, It's either someone's wishing for their love Or someone's dead. They said on some nights the headless nun even joined. Hey, hold on. We're not done yet. Wait! Boss. Damn it. Come back here! What's wrong with you? Cheating old bastard! They haven't paid me yet. Where did they go? They don't want it anymore? Why don't you go ask them? Because of you! It looks too damn real. I'll cut it off your salary. Pick them up. Hope you lose your legs! "The Offering" I'm pissed! Is there nothing that works anymore around here? Mod, did you mess up my TV? No salary for you this month! So it sticks in your head. You have to be damn careful with my stuff. Boss! Boss! Boss! Are you calling me Boss or Bossy?! Check it out. What do you want me to look, Mod? Madame. Since when did you get back? As soon as you did. Are you blind? Did you eat? Go get something. Mod, do you notice she's being weird? You knew it, right? Yeah. Being kind to you like this, She must've done something wrong. Don't you think she wanna be good to us for the last time? What are you whispering? No. Nothing. Mod, you got work to do, right? Get the hell out. I'm gonna eat with my wife. Go. Get lost. As you wish, boss. Keep this for yourself, then. Just what I wished for. My favorite hot chilli paste? Thanks. Hon, I'm so sorry. It was my fault. I shouldn't have gone out. Boss! Poor you, shouldn't have gone off like this. She must want you with her. You're a zombie! Zombie, my ass! I'm faking dead! Hon, I'll go shower, okay? Juju Look! Even the cucumber's full of worms! You watch too many horror films! Madame is a ghost. Not a bear, you don't have to fake dead. I think we should run. But that's your own wife. You want her? Be my guest! Come. Come. Honey, please come upstairs. Your wife's waiting. Are you going up? She's calling you. Going up to the ghost?! Come on! Where are you going? Get inside! Okay. Where were you going? I wasn't going anywhere. Just wanna take the trash out. I see. Good. Cuz I don't want you to leave. I want you to stay with me. Hon... I have something to tell you. Stone cold. What I have in my mind... I still cannot tell you... Until something's done. What's that? Take you to heaven! Good luck, Boss. Don't you love me anymore, hon? I still love you. But I can't take you like this. You already knew? Hon, I'm sorry! Mod, turn the light off for what? It's an accident, I didn't know. Your cellphone's cool. It survived such a drop! You go get it for me, Mod! No! I'm gonna shove you down. Go ahead, we'll fall together. Let me fix my pants. Hello? Honey, she said her husband left. You can go to her. Holy shit! You're having an affair? You old cow! Where're you going?! Juju, please don't hurt me. You, bastard! Mod, help me! Leave us alone! Man, that's close! She was scary as hell while alive. Now, the ghost version is even more terrifying. What are we gonna do, Boss? Is she still here? If you wanna know, go down and find out. I'll go through the balcony. The beneficiary... Mr.Grerkgiat Hattakitphaisan, Husband. What's this, Boss? My wife left me 10 million baht. Why?! Juju Since the day we married, People have been talking. They say I look too goddamn handsome to have this shovel-face by my side. Nobody knows that my Juju... That she had a golden heart? No, big ass. I love big booty. The only gift I ever gave her ...is that damn car. Think about it. She'd been so nice to me. But I shoved her down the stairs. Juju. Juju. Where's that noise from? I think in front of the shop. Then let's head back. Mod, go get me the pail! Damn it. Why is it so hard to burn the joss paper for my wife? Go get more joss servants! So my wife's taken care of. Get me the new lighter, too! Should I bring some cards? She likes playing cards. You think that she turned around... Cuz she's mad or happy? Juju, may you rest in peace. - Rest in peace, my ass. - Boss! You, too! You think I'm a ghost?! But you died. So you're a ghost. Look at my pretty face! Do I look like a ghost? It's really you! Juju! You're not dead. My Juju's alive! You really think I'm dead? I saw some pictures in the news. It was your car. And there was someone inside. I figured it was you. Why did you crash your car like that? Jackpot 9. 6, three flush. I miss you. There's someone around. Go away. Which one do you want? I like it so much. Why didn't you just tell me that you lost in card games? I meant to. But I fear you'll get mad. So I tried to put you in a good mood first. Honey, please come upstairs. Your wife's waiting. Come on. Let's go. Where're you going?! Let me see, where? Just a little burn and sting, okay? But when you fell down, where were you when we turned the light on? We couldn't see you. I fell too far away. How could you see that? Leave us alone! Why didn't you tell us? Why sit and cry outside? My husband has a mistress. You want me to laugh? Shut the hell up, Mod. Juju, I don't have any mistresses. I just had a fling from time to time. I swear, no one from now on. Never again. No one's as good as you, my Juju. You can lose as much as you want in the gambling. I won't say a word. As long as I have my nice wife back, I'm glad. Put it on more, baby. You want more? Come here, you cutie. I'm hurting all over. Got shoved down the stairs. I'm sorry, darling. Hey, where're you going? It's almost 3 AM, I'll go to bed. No, not yet. You see, the stuff's all over the place. Clean it up before you hit the sack. Can't it wait til tomorrow? Both your husband and I made this mess. Mod, you blame it on me? It's you who misled me with those pics. - Right. - Honey, - Cut his salary. - Agreed. Still here? What are you looking at? Wanna have a problem with me? - What ya looking at? - Like that. Do as my wife says, don't complain. And remember, If it weren't for me and my wife, You would have nowhere to crash. Don't forget to call Tar. Ask where he is. Just sent him to buy some curry, Now it's 3 AM and he hasn't shown up. What the fuck's wrong with him? Hey, Tar just entered the room. Where is he now? Hey, look at Tar's motorcycle. Is he dead? But who was that? No way, don't talk bullshit. I think we're misunderstanding. See? His friend's still texting him. He can't be dead. You're right. But this friend died 3 months ago. Shit. Forget it. It doesn't matter anyway. Let's go. - Wait, Maâ€™am! - What now? Tar used to tell me. If he dies, I should bury the photo of his mom with him. Fucking fussy. You get going. Why?! I think these walls can't keep ghosts away. That'll be a dead-end for you. Why now?! Go check what Tar's doing. He's searching for something. Something in your hand. Give it back to him! Yeah. And you tell him, If he's dead, go be with his friend. Go there yourself. He may listen to an old man If you don't go now, I'll kill and send you to be with them. It's always me. Tar I feel for you. You had to live with fear all the time. From now on, You must be by yourself. Good luck, man. What the heck is he doing? Mod... Rest in peace, man. You lived with fake things for all your life. Worked with fake things, You even lived with this fake couple. I kept my promise. Good luck, pal. How did you go pick up the photos for Tar? Told you. That'll be a dead-end. Why did you put so much stuff here?! How can I know? We put 'em here together, not only me! Tar, don't burn the house. I'm in here, Tar. Stop. Boss. Look at that. Why did I die so ridiculously? Ma'am, what are you doing here? Pull over, I said pull over! Hey, I said pull over! I said pull over, do you hear me?! Hey. Bitch, pull over! Don't you hear? Pull over! What do we do now, Ma'am? She won't stop. Overtake her! Go block her way! Ma'am, what if she doesn't stop the car? Don't be afraid. She will have to. She won't dare crash into us. Where you going, Mod? I'm going to a heavenly place, Boss. Back to my homeland. You can't call the police to arrest me anymore. Now you're rich, Mod. Nothing left for me. Shit! Oh... lucky me! Come on, Tar. Let's have a ride. Rang I thought you were dead. Rang, I'm sorry. I don't wanna die yet. I made a mistake. Please go away. I'm sorry! Fuck! It can't be true! It can't! No! I don't wanna die. Tar, let's continue on our way... Go find the heavenly place. Trust me. Here is your ride. They sent it to you. Tar, Come on. Hon... Tar burnt everything up for Mod. Will anyone burn something for us? Look. There's nothing left. Who said so? We have each other left. Let's go, darling. Go where? Somewhere heavenly for us, Juju.
