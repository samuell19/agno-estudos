(crowd murmuring) - [Announcer] Jake Raye has begun to dominate the middle round, showing swifter hand-speed, landing all his hits with deadly accuracy. I'm sure the scorecard's show him well ahead on points. He'll have to slip up in a big way to give Mickey Sheehan an opening. Sheehan, the challenger from Ireland, will need a knockdown if not a knockout in order to win this fight! Raye moves in! (thudding) And lands a crushing overhead right that drives Sheehan back into the ropes! (thudding) (grunting) There's combination sidekick and jabs! (crowd cheering) Uh-oh! He catches Sheehan with a right cross! (thudding) Raye hits him again with a back-kick, Sheehan misses him completely! - Work him, man, Raye, work him, get on him! - [Announcer] By straight shots to the body! Sheehan is dazed but recovers quickly! Raye moves in again, backing him up to the ropes. Oh, and a big roundhouse to Sheehan's head snapping him back! He rolls along the ropes, he recovers to throw an awkward left, trying to counterpunch! I don't know where Sheehan has found the stamina to keep on his feet! He's taking a real pounding! Raye ducks under glancing right and let's go flurry of left-right jabs again! Sheehan is put on the ropes! That cut over Sheehna's left eye looks controlled. Raye hangs back, looks like he can't figure out (bell ringing) how to take Mickey Sheehan out Sheehan moves in and there's the bell that ends round five! (crowd applauding) Raye moves back to his corner. Mickey Sheehan needs all the help he can get. Though his legs maybe shaky, he shows very little sign of weakening or fatigue. Raye... - Finish him off, Jake. Put him away so we can get outta here! - What the hell you think I'm tryin' to do? He won't go down. - We've got money in this round, man, put him away. - Hey, you laid down the money, you fight him. - [Announcer] Hailing out of El Paso, Texas, grew up fighting in the Golden Gloves, combines that with his training in the martial artist. This makes his 15th title defense with victories over Bruce Boom Boom Cannon, Freddy Grosblat, Martian the Shark Rosenberg and Brian Gilby Gilbert! Mickey Sheehan is a gutsy, heads-up fighter relying more on his fists... - Seconds out. - [Announcer] But tonight so far he's had his hands up mostly on defense. There they go, the men stand up as we're about - Kick his ass, Jake! - Sheehan really needs to go (bell ringing) Wait, there's the bell! And forget that idea, Raye moves on the attack A swipe to the right, into the corner with blows to the legs and a right uppercut! (crowd cheering) Now for the spin back! Whoa! - Yeah, good! Beautiful, beautiful! - [Announcer] He comes in, blows to the right and oh! (crowd cheering) He's pushed back! Sheehan looks hurt, he's sprawled out on the ropes! - Hold it! - [Announcer] The referee moves in the check him out! - Are you sure you're okay? - What's going on? Sheehan pushes the ref out of the way! He's advancing towards Jake. He throws a weak hook and now an awkward side-kick. Both misses! Raye isn't sure - Kick his ass! - [Announcer] Whether to go on fighting, for him it's over! - Come on! - Come on, now! - [Announcer] Sheehan with another wild miss! He wants to keep fighting but his body looks gone. - Come on, Jake! Get on him, man, what're you waitin' for? - [Announcer] Finally he unleashes! (crowd cheering) (thudding) (grunting) Jake Raye again hangs back. - Get the asshole, get the asshole! - [Announcer] They wanna see him put Sheehan away! - Get him, get him! - [Crowd] (chanting) Raye! - Finish him! - Kill him! (thudding) (crowd cheering) - [Announcer] Sheehan is down! (ominous music) The referee will certainly stop it now, I don't think Mickey Sheehan will be coming back from that blow! And yes, yes! - He's out! - [Announcer] This fight over, the referee just waved Mickey Sheehan out! Jake Raye has successfully defended his Light Heavyweight Championship over Mickey Sheehan! (crowd cheering) - Ladies and gentlemen! The winner by a knockout, in 1 minute and 38 seconds of the sixth round and still the Light Heavyweight Champion of the World, Jake the Dragon Raye! - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, Mickey Sheehan has just been pronounced dead. - Take 'em off. - It wasn't your fault, man, he just kept comin'. - Take 'em off, God damn it! - Jake, Jake, just a minute, just a minute. Did you know how badly he was hurt? What are your plans to defend the title now? - Get outta here, dickhead! Come on, Jake, come on, let's get outta here. - What are my plans? I'm never gonna fight again. - Jake, you don't mean it! - You heard it, folks. - Here you go, Jake. - He said he... - Never! - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, Raye has just thrown his championship belt into the crowd! You heard it, Jake Raye, the current Light Heavyweight Championship kickboxer, has just quit the sport! This after delivering a finishing blow that resulted in the death of Mickey Sheehan! (somber music) (baby crying) - [Man] Shut that kid up, huh? - [Woman] Get over here! What's your problem? - [Man] Go blow it out your ass! - [Woman] You wanan take care of the kid? What am I? (helicopter whirring) - [Man] Hey, shut up! - [Other Man] Hey, we're tryin' to sleep here! (baby crying) - [Landlord] You all quiet down or I'll evict you! (traffic humming) - [Woman] Shut up! - [Landlord] I warned you! - [Woman] What do you mean shut up? Look who's... - [Man] Close your frickin' window, huh? - I said shut up! - What do you expect me to do? - You look like shit! - Well you are shit! (phone ringing) - Fuck you both, shut up! - Don't you say fuck me! - Kick his ass, babe! - Lady, please! - [Drunk] Hey, I locked myself out! - Where's the fire? - Yeah? - Jake, it's Vinny, you up? - Vinny! Jesus where the hell are you? - [Vinny] I'm in trouble, man, I'm in Manila. - Yeah, what else is new? Manila? - You gotta help me, man. Remember that guy Su? Who wanted to manage me to arrange some fights? - Vinny, I told you Su was a lowlife! He's a gambler, not a manager. - Let's get low. - Hold on. Why don't you go back to sleep? I'll be off in a minute. - Mm, I can get something else off. - [Vinny] Who's there? - Nobody. Nobody you know. - [Vinny] I'm scared, man, he's got me by the balls! I laid some bets, lost some fights, now he thinks he owns me! He's threatening to break my legs if I try to leave. - Yeah, so you call me. How long's it been since I heard from you? - What's that got to do with anything? My ass is on the line now! - Almost a year. - Yeah, okay, fine, it's been awhile. What have you got goin'? I hear you're fuckin' around, outta shape, live like a pig! - Hey, I'm in shape, I'm workin' out, teachin' seminars. - Well, maybe helpin' me will help you. - I don't know. - Hey, we're still friends, right? I helped you when you needed me, I've always been in your corner. - I know, but that's all behind me now. I don't fight anymore. - I know but look, I just need help gettin' out of town. No fightin', I promise! - This nobody wants your money, 50 bucks. - Hold on. All right, I'll come. - Hey, thanks buddy-boy! And that's the last time I ask anything from you ever again! I swear! - Yeah, yeah, that's what you said last time. Where do I meet you? - [Vinny] Stronghold Gym, Maktai City. Somebody there will know where to find me if I'm not around. - See ya, Vin. (tense music) (plane humming) (traffic humming) (PA speaking foreign language) (whistle blowing) Excuse me. How much to the Stronghold Gym? - 900 pesos. 900 pesos? - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! - Hey! - I take you for only 500 pesos! - He was my ride! - You crazy, 900 pesos - You saw it! - is too expensive!

(pedestrians screaming) (man yelping) (horn honking) (splashing) (Jake grunting) - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Jesus, what the hell are you tryin' to do, kill me? Now where's the damn gym? - We're here, we're here! - Great! - Go ahead, the entrance is at the end of the alley, I'll get your bags. (group laughing and playing) (ominous music) - Hyah! (thudding) (blows landing) (grunting) (thudding) (engine revving) (scraping) (smacking) (crashing) - Who hired you? Did Su send you? - No, they came to me, they told me to pick you up and bring you here that's all! - Who did? - One of them. - Forget it, I don't have time for this! Where's the gym? - 1 Banaba Circle, I'll take you! - Thanks, I think I'll drive this time. You don't mind if I borrow your cab, do ya? - [Cabby] Please, please, it's all yours! - Yeah, that's what I thought! - What? - You idiots! I don't wanna hear excuses! Find him, follow him, nail him! Nevermind, he's here. Ah, don't forget to get rid of that cab driver. You think you can do that? Mr. Raye. (tense music) (thudding and clanking) (grunting) (mysterious music) (thudding) - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Yeah? - I'm lookin' for a guy, Vinny Petrello. He's a kickboxer, you seen him in here? - No. - Look, I gotta find him, he's in some kinda trouble. He's a big black guy with a big mouth. - I don't know anybody with a big mouth except maybe for you. Now when I work out, I only talk with fighters, you dig? - Yeah, I think I understand. (Jake grunting) (thudding) (thudding) (gym patrons murmuring) - John Jones, how you doin'? - John Jones. - Tobo Castenerra. - Name's Sal Taylor. - Sal the Widowmaker Taylor, glad to meet you. Jake Raye. - Juen? I might need you in a minute, be on standby. (knocking) Come in! - I'm looking for someone. - You found someone. - His name is Vinny Petrello, he's a friend and a fighter. Said that you did some work for the guy that owns this place but no one's seen him around. - Sounds like your friend doesn't wanna be found. Very impressive display in the gym, by the way. - Look, I just got waylaid by four guys in some alley and now you act like you're in on some big joke. I don't want any trouble, I just want to see Vinny. - No joke. (ominous music) But lots of trouble. (action music) (blows landing) (grunting) (yelping) (crashing) (blows landing) (grunting) (clattering) (shattering) (blows landing) (grunting) Freeze! (gun firing) (thudding) (blows landing) (grunting) (shattering) (blows landing) (grunting) (thudding) (mysterious music) (energetic action music) (crowd murmuring) (thudding) (blows landing) (grunting) (tense music) (grunting) (yelping) - Jeez, I almost took your head off! You were at the gym. What do you want? Why are you following me? - You were looking for a man named Vinny Petrello. I think I may know where he is. (clattering) Look, we should go somewhere. If I could catch up with you, so can they. - What do you mean they? - I'll tell you everything I know but first we should find a safe place. Come, come on, I know of a place. - Wait, where we going? - Come on! (mysterious music) - Stay back. (grunting) (grunting) (blows landing) (clattering) (roaring) (thudding) (yelping) (splashing) Just tell me this, why are you helping me? - Because in the gym, you seemed to be truly concerned about your friend. Look, I'll scout around for a cab. Just be safe. (ominous music) (whirring) - There'll be no need to put up a fight, Mr. Raye. There is no escape. (clicking) Now, this looks much prettier. I would hate to disable you before your match. - Fuck you, geek! - Yeah, sure. Let me show you something. (tapping) (Jake yelping) Look at my thumb, Mr. Raye! Mr. Raye! Gee, you're numb! (laughing) (adventurous music) (water splashing) (boat creaking) - [Jake] Shit! - [Man] Shit you. - Bobby! - Rise and shine, wimp! What do you think this is, a country club, Raye? Get the lead out! - What the hell's goin' on here? - I don't know. I was gettin' off a plane in Manila, been invited to one of those mixed matches, you know? - Yeah, a big tournament, the Thrilla in Manila part two. - That's Ernest Santana from Chicago. Ernest, Jake Raye. - Ernest. - Jake. - Anyway, as I left the airport some asshole cold-cocked me. - What happened to you? I remember when no guy could take you. - Bullets talk louder than fists. - I heard that! They was on my ass like flies on shit! - Has anybody in here see Vinny Petrello? - He's not here. So, welcome to the party! - Whoever the host is, the invitation sucks! - Yeah, don't exactly give you time to change into a tux, either. Must be a come as you are party. - Look, I know who's behind all this, it's a guy named Su. He's a gambler, he's probably dreaming up some high stakes the illegal tournament. Vinny says he's crazy. (mysterious music) - Be careful, you know what they say about drinking the punch at strange parties. (engine revving) - Shit! (tense music) - It looks like wherever we are, we're here. - Gee, that's real profound. Anybody got a hacksaw? (chains clattering) - [Kat] Go, go, go! - Careful with those fighters, Kat, Mr. Su doesn't want them hurt. Undo their leg chains. - It's too dangerous! - I'll take the responsibility, just undo them. (dramatic music) (chains clinking) - Move your ass! - Yeah, yeah. - Hey! - Wait there! - Vinny, send all available guards to the dock immediately. - Jun, get the van, load everyone up! - Okay, let's go! (guards shouting in foreign language) - Who removed the leg chains? - I gave the order, Mr. Su. The fighters could not get out of the hold without getting hurt. - A very foolish move. - Su! Why are we here? - Welcome to paradise. I am sure you're all looking forward to tonight's entertainment. The ancient sport of gladiator fighting. - What's this gladiator shit? - He means fighting to the death. You can't make us fight! - With a proper incentive, anything is possible. I am a peaceful man, but when the peace is threatened, I must take matters into my own hands, you understand that don't you? Good, I am glad we see eye to eye. (slashing) (gasping) (grunting) (yelping and choking) Kat, get the leg chains back on. (chains clinking) Jake Raye, World Light Heavyweight Kickboxing Champion, retired undefeated.

(bouy bell ringing) (helicopter whirring) (Jake grunting) (Jake grunting) (thudding) Who was in charge of the men? - Ricco. - And who was in charge of Ricco? - I was. - And Jake Raye is still missing? - He's becoming more trouble than he's worth. - Idiot! The stakes are highest in this fight, without him, there is no contest! You'd best hope that he is found. And as for you, Mariella. How generous of you to give drink to this band of thirsty gladiators! Since when have we become so sympathetic? Have we had a change of heart? - Well, I only thought of... - Of the kind words you gave Jake Raye at the warehouse door. If this lifestyle does not suit you, you can always be returned to the slum of your childhood. There is a lesson needed here. You must be taught the meaning of loyalty and service. (tense music) (Mariella gasping) (tearing) (Mariella yelping) (smacking) (Mariella yelping) - No! (insects chittering) (engine rumbling) (gentle classical music) (grunting) (thudding) (blows landing) (grunting) (thudding) (yelping) (guests murmuring) - Varuke, I'd like you to meet Patricia Dawson. - Pleased to meet you. - Patricia owns a chain of casinos in Reno and Monte Carlo. Varuke, well, he supplies non-military aid to struggling nations, a kind of quiet diplomacy, you might say. - You mean the bullets, not the guns? (Su laughing) - Something like that. - Look Su, you always do well at these fights but what about the men? What's in it for them? - Before they came here they had nothing, I have given them a life. In exchange for that they provide me a service. Everyone profits, that is the American Way, isn't it? (clattering) (men grunting) - Hey! (grunting) (blows landing) - So where are the waiters? We've gotta have waiters! (both laughing) - That's a good one, Su. - All right, Eric. - Su. - Gallahan! Nice to see you. - Good party, nice seein' our old friends. - I hope you're enjoying yourself. - Jake's in the house. - All right, gather tonight's special guests, find Dieter, and bring them all downstairs. - Okay. (party guests laughing) (Mariella gasping) (Mariella yelping) - Stop it! You fooled me once, it won't happen again. I don't wanna hurt you, I just want information. Where are the fighters being held? Answer me! - They are downstairs in the holding pen. - And what is this place? Where are we? - Paradise. - Don't play games with me! - It's this Island, he calls it Paradise. I'm gonna need your help. - Maybe you could get off me. (thudding) - Stop it, stop it! (Mariella groaning) Jesus! Who did this to you? Su's behind everything here, what is he you? - Guardian. Benefactor. - Hero? Savior? God? - At one time. I was very young. - Welcome to the real world, muchacha. My friends and I are getting out of here, come with us. All I need is Vinny. - Vinny has joined with Su, he's one of his fighters. - Impossible! - There's more, he's involved with drugs. - I can't believe it. Vinny lives fast but he'd never go over the edge. There's something I'd like to show you, tonight is not what it seems. (tense music) (blows landing) (grunting) (whirring) (door rattling) ♪ And you'll have to take steroids ♪ ♪ Take them overly ♪ ♪ As you know the other way is more painfully ♪ (Dieter humming) - Winners. Pick the winners. Now that would be the gambler's dream. But how does one do it? With a crystal ball? Extrasensory perception? Pay offs? Rig the ball? Special shoes? A loaded bat? (chuckling) Every single path to a successful, dishonest victory has been closed down to us until now. High-performance, new, improved. Your dream come true. A steroid not only powerful but totally undetectable. Dieter invented it and tested it and it takes only four hours to be totally assimilated into the body tissue, leaving no trace whatsoever in blood or urine. Athletes can be moneymakers! And gentlemen, you have the edge in every competition! Tonight, you will see the proof. In tonight's fight, the best fighters in the world against my men. - Steroids, you were right. - Shh. (tense music) - [Guard] You two, check down every hall! - Quick, in here! - What? - Careful! - Hey, look in here! - Yes, sir! - There's nothing here, sir! - I got it. - Check the end of the hall! - Right over here? - You two heading in there? - Unlock it! - All right, let's go! - Okay! (suspenseful music) - All clear here? - Nothin'! - [Guard Leader] All right, you two follow me, quickly! (romantic music) (tense music) (guard chuckling) - Huh? (grunting) (blow landing) (thudding) (grunting) - What the hell is that? - Let's check it out. - Maybe someone's coming in? - What the fuck's goin' on? - We're in trouble. - Wait, wait. - Who is it? - They're right outside. - You hear somethin'? - Hey, it's Jake! (all shouting) (pounding) (thudding and grunting) - All guards to the cage door, Jake has arrived. - He hasn't seen me yes, right? - Right. (grunting) (thudding) (action music) - No! - Mariella, where have you been? We might be able to, ugh! (blows landing) (grunting) - [Vinny] Jake! Jake! - Vinny! - No, Jake, don't do it! - [Vinny] I'm here! You gotta help me! No! - You bastard! (thudding) (Jake grunting) (somber music) (Dieter groaning) - Lock him inside and get the other men ready. - Yes, sir. And Mariella? - I saw what she did. I want her alive, understand? - Yes, sir.

(crowd cheering) (fighter roaring) (Bobby groaning) - He did good. - Better, a lot better. (crowd cheering) (clattering) - Miss Mariella. You must come with me now. (thudding) (yelping) (crowd clapping) (crowd chattering) (Manny grunting) (thudding) (grunting and yelling) - Ooh, I think you're gonna make a bundle!

(thudding) (grunting) (crowd cheering) (yelping) (thudding) (crowd cheering) (ominous music) (crowd yelling) (thudding) (yelping) (crowd cheering) - You better look for Mariella. - That won't be necessary, the house is completely sealed off. - Do it. (crowd chattering) - Right away. - What the hell's going on? - John's dead, Manny's dead, Bobby's all busted up. The guy's fuckin' nuts! (tense music) (thudding) (grunting) - Sal, you can't fight him head on! That won't work for these guys, they can't feel pain. (action music) (blows landing) (grunting) - Get him, Sal! (grunting and yelling) (thudding) Yeah, Sal, nail him, rearrange his face for him! (grunting) (blows landing) (fighter yelping) Yeah!

(blows landing) (grunting) (crowd cheering) (dramatic music) (thudding) (grunting) (yelling) (thudding) (tense music) - Mariella! We have been looking for you, where have you been? - I'm leaving this island. - Don't be ridiculous, you have no life besides Su. - We'll see. - Stop! - You know very well that I can't let you go! - What do you want from me? - I want you to go with me to the fights. You know, Jake is going to have his fight very soon. Maybe you wanna watch him getting some smashed by Vinny? Come come, come come, let's go, let's go. Careful careful, huh? Yes, good... (thudding) (Dieter yelping) - You bastard! Why do you bother? He just uses you! - What? I have my rewards! These fighters are my creation! As much as you are his creation, you are his daughter! (Dieter laughing) (thudding) (Dieter choking) (crowd clapping) (grunting) (thudding) (fighter roaring) (thudding) (grunting) (fighter growling) (grunting) (thudding) (fighter yelling) (thudding) (grunting) - Kill him.

(crowd cheering) - Come on, you piece of shit motherfucker, let's throw down! - Always a scammer, huh Vinny? And now murder. Is it the money? Is that it? What'd you promise him, Su? Lots of money, right? - Just keep it up, Jake. (blows landing) (grunting) - Or did he promise you some big fights? Maybe a championship? You're so buzzed you can't even think straight! - Shut up, Jake! - You're wastin' time, man! - Look at yourself! You're a loser! When you fight on drugs, you don't win anything! (thudding) (grunting) (crowd cheering) You're a fuckin' joke! - Hey, fuck you, man! You're too stupid to see the big picture here! You nickel and dime your way to the top and what do you got? Nothin'! Me? I got Paradise! - Let's go, Vincent. - We were friends, we don't have to do this. - It's time to cash in, Vinny! - No can do, buddy-boy. - He's runnin' your life! Take it back. - I take plenty, and this fight here, I take it all. (dramatic music) (blows landing) (grunting) Come on!
