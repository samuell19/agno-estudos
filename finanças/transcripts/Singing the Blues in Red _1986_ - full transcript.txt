Mr. Drittemann, we are accustomed to seeing people in the West, who are rather happy to be here. You don't seem to be happy. What's the problem? What's the hang up? I am not unhappy. I am no happy. I am not unhappy. I am only here. Where did you learn your English, Mr. Drittemann? Oh! I learnt... English at the... at my mother's knee. She's a teacher. I understand that your mother is a... a very well established senior Party Member in East Germany. How does she feel about you coming here? It's only private. It has happened before, but now... we were never as broke. You are jointly responsible... It is true, it's not true. It is false, it's not false. If it is false, it is not true. I understand... I do not understand... It is clear. It Si not clear. It is fast. It is slow. It is full. It is not full. It is fair. It is not fair. It is good. It is not bad. Venez. Just take a picture for the border effect. Yeah, yeah, here. Yes. It's okay. Thank you. Yeah? Paranoia.

Do you know that Crest Silver Wing Air Band contest has opened new horizons in the world of entertainment? There's another contest on Thursday, October 31st. That's Haloween, you know. So plan your costume, come on out. You can even call Berlin Military 5597. Okay. I'll be there. Hot hits on stereo, 24 hours a day, on 88 FM the best in Berlin. Ah! Peep-show. Yes. I heard something about it. That's a way? You speak English? A little bit. Great, great, great. Thank you for calling back. Okay. Yeah. This what we need you for. Um... A Rock... a Pop...

Well, wait a minute... Okay. Could you push the figure up from 25,000 upto 30,000... and then we'll work down from there. I'm afraid they're gonna say 'We'll give you...' you know... I know it is. Let's just start at 30,000. Okay. Fantastic. Thank you for calling me back. When do you think you're gonna get back with me... uh... to me? Good talking to you. Bye bye. These are just a couple of ideas we come up with. You'd like anything... that you have to suggest? There's some of the fan mail that we got since the Nicaragua song... was published. And... uh... did you get to the contract? I looked. Uh... the chief here is anxious to announce the signing at the press conference,if that's at all possible. Why not? You have got about $20000 in rights worldwide, but I don't think you're have to worry much about money once the Taube has you on it's books and the tour's been agreed to. And the welcome party... Do you know Rainer Schiff? He's agreed to be the host. No. I've never met him. He's been quite a success since he came West. What happened to Taube? Hans Taube? We bought him out. Two years ago. That was Head Office in New York on a... Oh God. I'm sorry. I think I've made a mistake. Do you want me to start all over? No. No. I understood. But it wasn't clear, how it applied to myself. Now it is. Look. Okay. The point is... everyone her, thinks that you... are a very important talent and American World is prepared to back that judgement all the way. And that's how all of this applies to you. Okay? Okay. Good. Look. I'll be right back. Just a sec. I left my number by the phone. I'll be in for the rest of the evening. Everyone if free to be proud, Mr. Drittemann. I'm not sure anybody has the right to be stupid. Did you find out anything about my father? No. I'm afraid not. Um... But we did manage to locate a French journalist who might be able to help you. I've left some of her work on on the table. Thank you. They told me you might be difficult. Me? The contract is important. The rest is pretty well up to you. -Yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah. -Thank you. Yeah. What about the interrogator? Can you tell me something about the interrogator? He asked me a lot of questions. I said it already. How old was he? Between 30 and 60. What did he look like? was he tall? Was he short? Very often, he looked... a little angry, I think. If English is giving you problems, we can speak German. No. I don't think so. English is not a problem. Well, let's see... your sister defected to the West four years ago. Is that right? That's what I heard. And was that the last time you spoke with her? About a year ago, she rang, to to complain about men, over in the West. She said... their problem was... they couldn't decide... whether they were pigs... or a bunch of tulips. I think we should meet again, Mr. Drittemann. How about next Tuesday? -Same time. -Tuesday's fine. Are you in touch with you father at all? Why do you ask? No reason, Mr. Drittemann. See you in Connecticut in the autumn. I'm crazy about the idea. Thank you so much. You do the best for me... Harvard has offered him visiting professorship for the fall. Oh, really? Okay. That's it until tonight. Like any of these? Uwe says he's waiting for the first smile. Have you heard any news of your father? My French woman arrives tomorrow. She will be at Schiff's party. I think the CIA likes me. They want to see me again. I was really surprised... to find I had already applied for a visa Well, like I told you... AmW is ready to back you all the way. Why make this difficult? What time is Braun? Eight. Okay. Okay. I would like to get some photographs of you by the Wall some time. if that's okay with you. I don't think so. Yes. But I prefer not to. Food as well? No. Thank you. I was really starving. Thank you. Welcome. What about... Jacob Drittemann? I think I found him. Your father gave his last public concert in 1971. He made his last record the same year, in Israel. He seems to have a health problem, heart perhaps, it's vague. In 1972, he visited America. New York in February, Washington in March. After that, nothing. Gone. No one knows where. Can you give me a light please? Thank you. Yeah. There is a man in Cambridge, England calling himself James Dryden to whom Philips International sent half yearly royalty payments, poste restante. Jacob Drittemann made two recordings with Philips. He receives any payment for that. There is more, but you have the bunch of it. I think James Dryden is your father. Tokyo, 1959. Edinburgh, 1971. When did you last see him? in 1953, 20th June. I was six. I'll stay here tonight, if that's all right. There's a couch... quite comfortable. I'll show you. There is no address. It's not quite sure he is living as James Dryden. He can just have a bank account under that name. But if you want him found, I have to go there. And since he is living incognito, it might help if you came too, to break the ice. Where's the bathroom? Up here. Let me show you. I will leave a number where to reach me. I'll be here till the press conference. That way. What tells you, he's my father, this Dryden? My nose. It's my work. That's what I do. Shall we go? How is everything? -Fine. -Good. Good. Good. How are you. -I'm fine. -Good to see you. How are you doing? Having a good time? Not bad, is it? You met with the French woman? Yeah. She rang me up. She said she won't be coming to the party tonight. It's not her... it's not her scene. Oh, she called us actually. It was just after we announced that, um... you had got your exit visa. and she said that she wanted to do a story on you and your dad. Hey! You took a lot. You're a damn fascist! What can you say positive about the GDR? Repeat it please. What can you say positive about the GDR? Is there anything that's worthwhile? There could be a lot. But I don't speak about my country. We were surprised... but I... you know... I don't think Braun... I speak for Braun on this too... I don't think uh... it's gonna have any long lasting effects... There was no harm done. I think everyone was rather... You know, the adrenaline got a flowing with that argument, and uh... um... we're... we're happy. I think he handled himself beautifully and... Very cleverly. His whole time over there, he spent mistrusting the press and he's got have time here to learn that the press over here is an animal. and that it can't be offended, if you use it and we use you and you use us, and it... it's like one big happy family. Press can take time. I think what he did is to just uh... emphasize the fact that he is a fiery... a passionate artist, and uh... he... that's what we bought. That's why we... that's why we need him. That's why we want him. He... he's got this passion and he's not afraid to use it. He's got an enormous amount of courage and he's gonna use it over here. Right now, I have to get off the phone. I'll get back to you okay? Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Bye. Bye bye. Yeah bye. Okay. I think we are ready. They seem to have liked your style,but it is a close thing. Okay. Have Braun see you in his office in five minutes. He needs to know about the contract today. Now. Yes or no. All right? Searching for peace and freedom. Stop. Maybe gig in Amsterdam. Stop. Signed contract on way. Stop. Drittemann. During the demonstrations, we can get on board the aircraft, look at all the instruments inside, Plus, all kids do enjoy going up on the aircraft... having the pilot's walk around... All right. This morning it's Captain Willis talking about the big Open day coming up, this weekend. We do have a call on the line now. Line 1. Your name please? My name is uh... Mavis Middleton. Good morning Mavis. It's nice to have you on the program. Uh... your question please, Captain Willis. Well, the friendly side is very nice, but what about the real purpose? Like the cruise missiles coming to Molesworth? Mavis, I'm sorry. Obviously, the question is not being direct in the way that we are talking this morning, about the Open Day. Mavis Middleton on Line 1 today. The Americans, much associated with music of course, what's your music preference? Anything like Crystal Gail or Pat Boone. Okay. That wasn't a cue for a song, but here is Pat Boone and 'Friendly Persuasion'. Good afternoon Madam. Could you turn off your engine please? Where are you going to? I'm going to Cambridge. You're going to Cambridge, all right. Could I have a look at your driving license please? You got it with you? No. Do you have your HA forms? Thank you. Pollock! check on that please. Very well, sir. Okay. Do you have your passport? Yes. I have it. Thank you. Well, we want see where you're going. Where are you going? We're going to the power station over there. What are you going to the power station for? -Base ball picketing. -Base ball picketing. -Base ball picket. -Yeah. We're demonstrating. You're not demonstrating if you're not going. -Who says so? -I say so. Well, who says we can't demonstrate? I got no rule. No. No. I reserved accommodation, before I knew you would come. A room with two beds, I hope. Yeah. Can you.. leave the coffee please? Oh, sorry. -Thank you. -Thank you. Unh. The water is icy. I'm afraid I'll catch a cold. Is he in the phone book? No. He's not in the book. And what about the Post Office? Could you find it? The landlady told me, it's not very far. Good. Tomorrow, we begin. Yes. Tomorrow, we begin. Poste Restante for Cambridge, please. It will be quicker and cheaper, to take it yourself. It's only a couple of miles down the road. How much? 4 pounds 20. We do two hour watches. Any longer and we will be noticed. I think this is a mistake. Sure. You look like a little boy. Where were you trained? Trained? Maybe it is all a mistake. I'm looking for a pen to leave you a note. There's a pen. Oh, that's dead. Doesn't work anymore. The package is gone. Someone came for it. Okay. A woman. I followed her with the car. It's just outside town. Come. I'll take you. I think there's time. Sit down please. Can you show me where it is? Sure. What is here? It's here. Can you give me the address? Mmm-hmm. Millhouse. 70 Station Road. I sense something wrong. Bad. I think you should better get back to Paris. Your work is done. Fine. You're the boss. Am I? What do you mean? Suddenly, it occurs to me a man doesn't hide, if he doesn't fear discovery. Dryden, Drittemann, it's all one. Political folk, are never safe, this side of the grave. So you think I am working for some... what? some Intelligence Service? You knew he needed funding, before I know it myself. And you even knew where he is. You needed me only, to confirm it. No deal. Why do you carry a copy of the brown book? Are you a fascist? Foot for foot! What ten? Yes. I'll tell you. In 1942, in Holland, my mother, who was sixteen, and thirty members of her family, were taken by Nazis and sent to the death camps. Here father and mother, grand parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, all died, except her. She was nineteen when Ravensbruck was liberated. She weighed twenty-five kilos. It was another five years before she could stand upright, and face the world again. And what she found was that most of those responsible, the Nazis, were back in high office again. Judges, administrators, businessmen, teachers... as though nothing had happened. Indeed nothing had happened to them. She decided to so something about it. To bring them to justice. I work for her. Jacob Drittemann was communist. Fought in the Spanish Civil War. Worked seven years... for the Academy of Fine Arts in the GDR. He fought against Stalinism every day of his life. When Stalin lived... he left in protest at the brutal repression, of the workers' uprising by the military and lives on to this day in the hearts of the socialist opposition there. What can any of this have to do with my father? I'll show you. There's two years work here. Between Spain and America your father spent some months in Holland, fighting with the Dutch Underground. Did you know? No. The town of Gouda. I found it in an archive. About a dozen German comrades took that route. One of them led a whole detachment group of resistance workers. 28 men and 12 women, to their deaths in a Nazi ambush. Your father may have known the traitor. I have to ask him So, do you like your home? All right. But I see him alone. Of course. Poor bastard. I don't him to be my father. Are you ill? No. Nothing. Dreams. You are discovering the West has no use for innocence either. My name is James Dryden. What do you want with me? -You speak English? -I do. Sit. Won't you? I prefer English. The cheese was clever. I have been expecting you, I suppose, most of my life. They say in these parts, the man born to be hanged need not fear drowning. That's how it has been for me. I count my life in days now. I listen each morning for my last blackbird. Not living, is no longer a problem. But I will die here, nowhere else. It is the only choice left to me. So, Si Rosa dead? Or did she finally decide to confess all, and go in her grave, with a clean Party card? It doesn't matter. In a way, she had no choice. Handing me over would have meant, putting herself under suspicion. To save herself and the children, she had to save me too. It was always something I had counted on. I met her in Spain. You know... Rosa, red, red Rosa. In the full, obscene bloom of her innocence. waiting for slaughter, like Stalin's daughter. I quote myself in opera. I was a child, a child too. Nineteen, twenty... seeking the ancient battle ground between between right and wrong... but I glimpsed what she would never see, The hand of the puppet master, controlling the dance. Why should this interest you... a hard functionary, a thing of the state, in your ridiculous coat. May I go on in my house? Come with me. Okay. This is England. Things must be done properly. This is what I do now. I don't know why. I've seen these faces all my life, in Hitler's Germany, in Stalin's Spain, in Roosevelt's America, in d'Ulbricht's Democratic Republic. And now here. It's the face of innocence. There is only power. Those, who have it, know it. Those who don't, must learn it. 'The ones who are ruled carry others. The once who rule are carried by others.' Meng-Tse, 600 BC It is the first law of humankind. The innocents think there is a choice, and stop at nothing to prove it. Do you choose to be here now? You server the masters. Did I choose to return to my country after the war, the agent of American Intelligence? We've both learnt the second law. Any life is better than no life. Later still, we learn the third law. It's all one, life is nothing. Will you kill me? No. Somebody will. I expected Americans. You know, they've always had problems acknowledging their death to the Third Reich. They wanted me disposed off years back. But I found out, slipped the noose. Here, I imagine, they've been content to let me lie low, and die with their secrets. But you are a Stasi, without question. Forty years... it's still the same SS hand me down for uniform. Am I still an opposition hero back there? You have to live in England, to learn the true nature of irony. But you know the second law... so you are no fool. Who sent you to Holland? Holland? After Spain, before America with the Dutch resistance. Forty comrades were led to their death in the town of Gouda. Oh! Yes. The Gestapo. Forty, was it? In Spain, they killed thousands. But fascists, they killed fascists in Spain. Comrades, comrade. Brothers in arms. Anarchists, syndicalists, trotskystes, paisans, workers. Stalin's orders. Liquidate the enemy within. Secure the leading role of the Party. The dream died in Spain. At the fall of Madrid, I was handed to the Gestapo, and the choice was clear work for the Third Reich or see my family in Leipzig destroyed. I worked for the Gestapo. When Holland fell, the Reich sold me to America. It is true, it's not true. It is false, it is not false. Did your wife know? Rosa went to Russia to practice her innocence, suck on filth, Rosa found her own way to be guilty. Are my children alive? And well? Rosa fought at Stalingrad. There is a difference. Your children are well. Who are you? Why are you here? We pay the price. Last law. Truly. You knew. Yes. Okay. Did you know everything? I knew the bones. I knew your father did a deal with the Nazis in Madrid. I knew he did their work in Holland. I knew the Americans lifted him in '45, even he was a Nazi collaborator, and sent back to Berlin a year later. I knew that he was their thing ever since. Do you know why he did a deal with the Nazis in Madrid? No. Did you care? Do you care? I don't know. I know it doesn't make a difference. I had imagined, that we were friends or comrades, somehow. What will you do with him? Speak with him. To find what I can. And that's all? No. I'll try and bring him to justice. He's a mad old man, rotted away. We have to begin somewhere. What about you? Here. Thanks. Okay. I'll drive you out there, tomorrow. All right. You have no reason to trust me. Don't I? Even though I mean you well. There is a telephone for Mr. Dittyman, Could it possibly be you? Thank you. You register as Mr. Dupayne and now it seems you are Mr. Dittyman. It's just not good enough. Oh! You never mind madam. Hello. Drittemann. Hi. Its's Lucy. Do you have a minute? We have to talk. Uh. Lucy. Go ahead. Okay. The Munich organizers have come back with a bigger and a better offer. Another $3000. Are you interested? What's in Munich? The pop festival. The thing is, it clashes with the Amsterdam date, which I will remind you, it's travel and accommodation. No fee, nothing. No. I prefer Amsterdam. Fix it with them. How did you know where to find me? Oh God. Look. Is it more paranoia, or a serious question? I rang the French girl and got the number. Do you want me to come to Amsterdam? Bye Lucy. Bad news? I wrote to the record company about a concert in Amsterdam. So? What's the problem? They knew I was here. And you think I told them? I don't know. You made a phone call the day we arrived here. I called my mother. She has to know where I am. And she's been after this man for almost fifteen years. Nobody else. Did you ask them how they found out? You should have spoken to them today. What? They know. We found him now. Tomorrow might be too late. The body of a Cambridge man was found hanging from beam this morning by his 14 year old daughter. The girl, Anne Dryden found her father James Dryden, a retired artist, in the kitchen of their family home, on the outskirts of the city. According to Mrs. Elizabeth Dryden, his wife, The dead man had been suffering from depression for some time. Foul play is not suspected. Local weather in a moment. Stay with... He told me... He told me he was going to be disposed off. # Killed. Okay. I leave you here. You going with this? Yes, I think so. Somebody should do it. If you go to Paris, come and see my mother. What's she like? What do you mean? She's like you? Me? Not at all. She is very serious. -Good bye. -Bye.
