- Ho ho ho! - Excuse me. Comin' through. - Way to go, Mike. - Stop! Hold it! Michael crane, Henry Biggs, Raymond Tunney... My holy terrors. Please remove your helmets. And I believe you know my nephew Jack green. - What's up, guys? - All right, skateboards, stack 'em. I have a big favor to ask you. - I just did you a big favor. - Well, all right, I need another big favor. Okay. - I have a contractor who has agreed to do renovations on the boys' wing between now and new year's. - Rita, I'm a toy maker. I am no good at renovation work. - I know that. I'm not asking that. - Good. - So I can only move so many boys into the girls' wing, and I was wondering if you might take my three eldest for the holiday. - Take your three eldest for the holidays? - Yeah. The ones you just met. - The holy terrors? - Oh, I exaggerate. Well, I'll...I'll talk to Cherie about it, but, uh... So skateboarding, huh? I've never really done that. Snowboard, though. You guys ever been snowboarding? I guess you don't get too much snow in this part of California. You guys ever seen snow? No. - Well, it sure adds something magical to the Christmas season, I'll tell you that. So you guys like singing in the choir? - Is that a joke? - No way. Miss green forces us. It's like torture. - I like it. - Dweeb. - Shut up, Henry. - Here we are. - Good to see ya. - Hey, guys, check this out. - Oh, hi. - Jamie got some parents. We're never gonna get adopted. - What makes you say that? - We're too old to be adopted. - Too old? - Ray's eight, I'm nine, and Mike's ten. That's, like, ancient. - Yeah, like 70 in dog years. - In orphan years, it's 100. - All right, guys. - Are you ready to go? Come on. - We gotta stick together, the three of us. - We're a team. - Like blood brothers. - Like bubble brothers. - What do you got in mind? - ♪ Oh, come, all ye faithful ♪ ♪ joyful and triumphant ♪ ♪ oh, come ye ♪ ♪ oh, come ye ♪ ♪ to Bethlehem ♪ - Children, need I tell you how important this Christmas concert is? We only do it once a year, so let's enunciate. Michael crane, I'm sure your singing will improve if you get rid of the chewing gum. Raymond Tunney, it would be nice if you paid attention. Henry, get rid of the chocolate bar. - What chocolate bar? - Henry Biggs, do not test me. - Okay, okay. - God sees everything, Henry, and on certain days, so do I. All right, let's take it again from the top. - ♪ Oh, come, all ye faithful ♪ ♪ joyful and triumphant ♪ - What's going on? - Michael crane. - How is my favorite chief financial officer? - Working on the balance sheet and making potato leek soup. - Oh, my favorite. - The balance sheet or the soup? - Well, the balance sheet, of course, because it smells so good. Mmm! - Hey, how was the choir thing? - Mm, good. You know my aunt. She makes general Patton look like a wuss. - Yeah, well, it can't be easy looking after all those kids. - She asked me if we would take in three of the boys for the holidays. But, you know, I just... I didn't think it was a very good idea. We got a week to go before Christmas. It's one of our busiest times, honey. - Jack, if you're being protective of me... - No, no, no, I just...I mean, it could be difficult, though. And the three boys that she's talking about, they're called the holy terrors, and for very good reason. - Holy...isn't that what your dad used to call you? The holy terror? - But still, three kids. It's a big responsibility, huge. - Yeah, but it might be nice to have four boys in the house for the holidays. - Four? - Well, including you. - Oh, see, now the tickle monster might have something to say about this. - Did I say keep your hands to yourself? I believe I did, and if I hear another word before we get out of this Van, I'm turning around and going back to the orphanage. - Leave me alone! - Be careful getting out. - A toy company? - Don't they make those wooden toys? Child labor is against the law. - Patience. - Hi, aunt Rita. Hi, boys. Welcome! - Boys, this is Jack's wife, Cherie. Cherie, this is ray, Henry, and Mike. - Well, it's nice to meet you. Welcome. - Well, there they are, the three luckiest boys in the orphanage. You guys are spending Christmas with us. - What if we don't want to be here? - Michael crane, zip it. - Yes, ma'am. - Okay, boys, get your backpacks. - They seem very sweet. - Yes, very sweet... Sometimes. - Are you really sure that I'm that kind of role model? - You're all that's available right now. - Here we are. - This is really cool. - A toy shop, and it's in a barn. - Yeah. - All right, boys, welcome to green's all-natural toy company. - Cool. - Ah, that was my dad's first design. It's our top-seller, and it's what started this whole thing. As you see, we do everything here by hand. We use lots of wood, lots of interlocking pieces, but no chemicals. - Cool. - My dad started this company before I was born, and he designed a lot of cool toys. In fact, now I'm the head designer. - I got one of these for Christmas last year. Hey, are you the guy who came to us dressed up as Santa? - Bet it was. Your beard looked fake. - Ha. Wait a minute. Are you telling me you guys don't believe in Santa Claus? - Grow up. There is no Santa. - You sure about that? - Um, I'm sort of on the fence. - I want to believe. - Well, I'm hoping by the end of your stay here, you'll all believe. - In what? - The magic of Christmas. All year long, we make toys for sale, but this one week before Christmas, everything we make, we give away. That's nice, Kel. - Thanks, Jack. - Give away? Isn't that bad business? - Heh! I don't think so. It's something I started doing a few years back, donating toys to charity, including your orphanage. - Is that what you think we are? A bunch of charity cases? - Oh, no. No, no, no. No, I'm sorry. I didn't...I mean... I just want to make sure that no kid in this area goes without a toy on Christmas morning. - Isn't that Santa's job? - I thought you didn't believe in Santa Claus. - Don't worry, Mr. Green, Mike just pretends to be tough. - Look, Mike, even Santa needs a helping hand now and again. Remember, Christmas is all about giving, sharing, and please, guys, call me Jack. - Yes, Mr. Jack. - Okay. This way. Gentlemen, this... This gentleman here is Mr. Rodney Smith. He is our shop foreman. So when they're here in the toy shop, I'd appreciate it if you keep an eye on them. Excuse me for one second. - Don't worry, Mr. Green, I got eyes in the back of my head. You guys can see how busy we are. I don't have time for babysitting. - Dude, we're not babies. - My point exactly. So here are the shop rules... Do not run. Do not bring in food or drink. Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir. - Over here, this is where we temporarily store our charitable donations. - Uh-oh, it's the sheriff. Why do you think he's here? - I don't know. We haven't done anything yet. - Hey, Dan, how you doing? - Fine. Just grabbing a few of these toys for the department's gift drive. Appreciate the donation. - Yeah, no worries. Hello, sheriff. - Boys. Jack, can I talk to you in private a minute? - Cherie, honey, why don't you show the boys to their room, let them get settled. - Okay, come on, guys. - Their room? Are they staying here? - Yeah. Well, at least until new year's. - You might want to reconsider. Those three are known troublemakers. Just a couple of months ago, they flooded the town library, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. If they were 18, they'd have a rap sheet a mile long. - Dan, they're just kids. - Uh-huh. You'll see. Thanks for the gifts. - I hope you guys will be comfortable here. - Thank you, Mrs. Green. - Oh, please call me Cherie. - Cherie. You know, in French, that means "darling." - That's right, it does. My, aren't you smart! Okay, guys, I'm gonna let you get settled, and dinner's at 6:00. - "In French, that means 'darling.'" sometimes you're such a dweeb. - Man, I hate this place. - Well, I love this place, and I'm taking this bed. - Anybody want a candy cane? Can a person actually be in love with sugar? - Look, just don't get too used to this, okay? It's only for the holidays. We're a team, right? - All for one and one for all. - Dan said the boys flooded the town library two months ago. I'll lock the cellar door. - Do you think they like us? - Hard to say. Ray and Henry, they seem okay, but that Mike sure has a chip on his shoulder. - Hey, um, did you have the chicken tonight? I put extra Rosemary in it. I don't know if this is, like, too fancy, but... - No, it's not. - I thought it was pretty good. - I thought it was very good. - We're gonna have to go to the grocery store a couple of times this week, probably, 'cause they're putting away a lot of food. When you're done with that, why don't you go tell the boys dinner's ready? - It's locked. It's my dad's old study. I like to...Keep it as it was. That's where I go to do my... My thinking, some designing and stuff. I like to think that I can feel his... His presence in there, and I connect with him. - So he's, like, in heaven now? - Yeah. - I never knew my dad. - Uh, dinner's ready. Why don't you go upstairs and get the guys? - Can I have another potato? - You may have another potato. You can have two. How about that? Here you go. - Why don't you guys have any kids? - Yeah, don't you want any? - Well, sure, yeah, we wanted children, but... - We came to the conclusion that it just wasn't meant to be for us. Henry, would you pass me the peas, please? Thank you. - Are you okay with us being here? - Of course. - Hey, you guys are our guests for the holidays. My aunt just thought that you guys would enjoy spending the holidays with us. - ♪ Do re me fa so la ti do ♪ ♪ do re me fa so la ti do ♪ - Do you have to do that every night? - Miss green says I got to do this to keep my voice limber. - Limber? Isn't that a type of cheese? - I'm gonna go get some water. You guys want anything? - Nope. - Yeah. Chocolate cake. - Yeah, right. - Do you ever stop eating? - Shut up. These are my growth years. - Mmm. Honey, that meal was fantastic. - Thanks. You know, looking around the table at those boys during dinner, it got me thinking. - About what? - Maybe we should adopt one of them. Which one? - Oh, I don't know. I guess whichever one fits the best. - You're kidding, right, honey? - Yeah. No. I-I-I don't know. What if I'm not? - Well, honey, we talked about adoption, and I thought we decided we're not gonna go down that road. - We didn't decide that. - I just felt like maybe you wouldn't... Be the same, and...and these boys, well, they're... - What, too much trouble? - No, no, it's not that. I just think maybe... They're a little bit too old. - Well, Jack, these boys need a home. We can provide that, at least for one of them. - It's a huge life-changer. Think about it. I don't know. I don't know. - Hey, where's my chocolate cake? - Forget that. I heard them say they were gonna adopt one of us. - Only one? - Which one? - I don't know. They didn't say. - Come in. My dad. So good with kids. - So are you. - I wanted kids so bad. - I know. So did I. - But it didn't happen. We tried everything, and it didn't happen. It was just... It was so hard. - Yeah. - On both of us. I thought we decided that making other people's kids happy was gonna be enough. - Maybe it's time for us to move forward. Let's just think about it. - Okay. We'll think about it. - It's late. - Hello. - Good morning. - A beautiful day, isn't it? - What are you doing here, miss Rita? - Well, Jack is my nephew, remember? - And my aunt Rita cannot resist my famous blueberry pancakes. Sit down, guys. Dig in. - Ray, Henry, the last time that you two cleaned up like this...Well, I can't quite remember. - We figured we're guests, so we cleaned up. - You combed your hair. - It's not a felony. - Watch your tone, young man. - Sorry, miss Rita. - We're gonna meet Santa today. - That's right... After choir practice. - I'm going to be painting some Christmas ornaments after breakfast. Who wants to help? - I do. - Me too. - Hey, Mike, you ever spend any time around horses? - Millions of times. - Good. Then I have a job for us after breakfast. - Millions? Really? - Later, if you want, I can help you out in the toy shop. - Me too. I mean, Christmas is now just five days away. - Well, that would be great, guys. Thank you very much. And you know what, ray? That's what I used to do when I was a kid. I would count down the days before Christmas. In fact, I think I still do that, don't I? Yeah. - Well, since we've got such a busy day ahead of us, let's eat. - After you, Henry. - Why, thank you very much, Mike. - When we finish the pens, we'll go out there and groom some horses. - I'm up for that. - Uh, whoa, hey. Are you sure you've done this before? - Why? Is there a right or wrong way to shovel this stuff? - Yeah. It goes in the wheelbarrow, not flying at me. - Oh, um, sorry. Is is true that manure could be the answer to all of our fuel problems? - Eh, could be. One of them, anyway. There's definitely an endless supply of it. - Did your dad teach you about horses? - Yep. He taught me about all kinds of things. - You're lucky. - Yeah. Sometimes I forget that. - What did you and Jack do with those kids? They're not supposed to be so... - What? - Well, nice and well-behaved. What did they do? Did they fall and hit their heads? - Excuse me, Mrs. Green. - We have the supplies. - Okay. Well, why don't you guys head out to the porch, and I'll meet you in a minute. - Okay. - Okay. - I'm really glad they're here. This is the first holiday we're gonna have a house full of kids. I have you to thank for that. - Well, I would save those thanks if I were you. They were wonderful pancakes. I gotta get back to work. - That's good. Just like you're doing there. Just comb through all the burrs. He likes what you're doing. - You can talk to him if you want to. His name is George. Named him after my dad. - Hey, George. I gotta tell you the truth. I've never done this before. I've never even touched a horse. Bet you figured that out, huh? - It's all right. It's pretty cool, though, huh? - Yeah. Mr. Jack, will you teach me how to ride? - Sure. Here. Hand me that comb. Here we go. - What are you doing? Right on there. There you go. You're riding. Hold on here. Hold on real tight, close to his skin. How's that feel? - Good. - Well, saddle him up. How's that? - Wow, you guys are doing great. - Do you always make your own decorations? - Always. It's more fun that way. - You know, Henry's not very good at this, but it's not his fault. - Do you know that some nights, ray wets the bed? - You know what, ray? When my little brother was your age, he did the same thing. You'll grow out of it. Trust me. - Ow! - Paint. Paint. - Where are we going? - The corral's too small for a riding lesson, so I thought I'd take you out here. Okay, I'm gonna hand you the reins here. Remember what I told you. Sit tall in the saddle. Look, you don't have to do this. You know that. - I want to. - You sure? Okay, when you're ready, sit up tall in the saddle, give him his head a little bit, a nice little squeeze with your heels, maybe a pop, and you're off. - Okay, George, you and me are gonna be buddies. What do you say? - There you go. Nice, Mike. Very nice. Sit up tall, sit up tall. - It's tough to compete with a kid learning to ride a horse. - Well, Mike doesn't want to be adopted. - Oh, please. Of course he does. And he's gonna milk this horse thing for all it's worth. - Why did you have to go and tell Cherie about the...You know? - They're only gonna pick one of us, ray. This is war. - So you boys want to help, huh? Yes, Mr. Rodney. - Well, here's what you do. You take each toy, wrap it in bubble wrap, put it in the box marked "c" for charity. You think you can handle that? - Yeah. We're not, like, stupid. - That's good to know. Handle with care. Do not scratch the paint. We take pride in our workmanship, and we do not do well with carelessness. - Okay, then, let's get to it. - Hey, that's pretty cool. - You know, they're gonna pick me. - Nah, I don't think so. You eat too much. - Hey, I gotta feed my natural charm. They're gonna pick me, you'll see. - Don't get your hopes up, Henry. - Just 'cause you got sent back for a refund doesn't mean I will. - Shut up. - You shut up. Oh, you're so bossy. - 'Cause I am the boss. - Get over yourself. It's no wonder that family didn't want you. - You take that back, tubs! - Make me. - Whoa. Ray, you broke some toys. - Me? You're the one who knocked me down. - This is all your fault, Mike. Are you okay, ray? Mike! Mike! You're gonna get it now, Mike! Hi, Mr. Rodney. - Get out, the three of you. Get out. Get out! Such tomfoolery wastes time, and a kid is gonna be without a toy on Christmas morning. Is that what you boys want to see happen? No, sir. - Well, here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna go back in there, and you're gonna clean up that mess... Quietly. And keeping your hands to yourselves. - He said a surprise. Why the ax? - He's too nice to be a serial killer. - You can never tell. - All right, boys, let's go. - Where are we going? - Over there by those mountains. - Why? - There's a pine grove over there. - So? - So it's a green family tradition to go out, find, and cut the perfect Christmas tree. - So we're gonna help you? - Well, that's the idea, yeah. That, and you get a chance to see much more of our property. - What's on the other side of the mountains? - The town. - And the orphanage, right? - That's right. Now listen to me. When we get there, I need you guys to find the two best trees. - Why two? - One for us, one for the orphanage. - You know something, Mr. Jack? You're really cool. - Heh! Well, thank you, Henry. I think you kids are pretty cool too. - This is gonna be fun. I never had a Christmas like this before. - Good. Well, come on, let's start. March, march, march. - I bet I'll find the perfect tree first. - Nah, I will. - You two don't know diddly-squat about trees. - Shotgun. - You got shotgun last time! - No, I didn't! - All right, nobody gets shotgun. You're all in the back. Load it up. Teamwork. - We've never done anything like this before. - Remember when Mike tried to chop down the flagpole? - Shut up. - Very interesting, Henry. But we're looking for Christmas trees, not flagpoles. - Right this way. - What is this? - We helped Mr. Jack cut two Christmas trees. - Well, I'm surprised. I didn't think, with the renovations, we'd have a Christmas tree this year. - Come on, Rita, I couldn't let Christmas go by without giving you a proper Christmas tree. - Well, god bless you. You're not Mr. Christmas for nothing. - Come on, guys, help me get this tree set up. - Kids, we have a Christmas tree! Hallelujah! All of us thank you guys. - Our pleasure. All right, guys. Let's go grab Cherie and get over to Santa land. - Next he'll take us to see the tooth fairy. - That's not Santa. - What makes you say that? - His beard's fake. He's not fat enough. He's not wearing glasses. - Mike, why don't you try to think of this guy as a representative of the real Santa Claus, who's still very, very busy up in the north pole? How about that? - Sure. Whatever. - Bye-bye. - Can I go first? - Sure. - Hello. - Hi. - So have you been a good boy this year, ray? - Well, it depends what you mean by "good." Oh. What would you like for Christmas? - I want to be the one. Can you do that? - I'm not sure what you mean. - You're Santa Claus. You're supposed to know everything. - Well, it's been a long day. - I want a forever family. - I'm sorry? - I want those two people to adopt me. Well... Let's talk about what we can get you for under the tree. Hmm? Oh. - Chocolates, lots of chocolates. And some mints would be nice. I like mints. Licorice. It's good for the brain. Ooh! And gummi bears. - Gummi bears. Okay. - You do have gummi bears, right? - Yes, we... - I love gummi bears. - Well, can I? - All right, go ahead. Get it over with. - What's he doing? - Searching for his own truth. Ow! Not so hard! - Whoa! His beard isn't fake. - So you really are a representative of the guy up at the north pole? - I am, indeed. So what would you like for Christmas, my boy? - It's a secret. - Okay. - I want them... As my parents. - Seems to be a very popular item this year. So you been a good boy? - Don't fall. It would be like an earthquake. - Yeah, a 7.0 on the Richter scale. - Boys. - You better hope I don't fall on you. All right, come on down. No earthquakes in this house. All right, honey, do the honors. - That is so cool. - Whoa. Best tree ever. - All right, guys. We got a busy day ahead tomorrow. Let's go to sleep. - Can you please turn my bed down, Mrs. Cherie? - Mine too? - I would be delighted to. - It's really beautiful, and we cut it ourselves. - That you did. Good job. Ah! I love Christmas. Well, w-w-what is your favorite thing about Christmas, Mike? - Mrs. Green's smile... When she opens a gift that Henry, ray, and I give her. We surprise her every year with something. - Well, that's a good one. You guys really like my aunt, don't you? - Yeah. She's like our mom. But don't tell her I said that, okay? - My lips are sealed. How long you been at the orphanage? - Since I was two, when they found me by the door with a note tied to my wrist. - All right. - Good night, Mr. Jack. - Good night. - Hey, ray, what are you doing? - Nothing. I wet the bed. Don't be mad. - Oh, sweetie, I'm not mad. - I didn't know how to use the washing machine. - Well, I know how to use it. - Are you sure you're not mad? - Positive. Why don't you go upstairs and get dressed? I'll finish up from here. - Okay. - So have you been thinking about it? - Hmm. Impossible not to. - You? And have you come up with any conclusions? - No. - It's not like going shopping. You know, I'll take those pair of shoes over those. It's just...It much more... - Complicated. - Yeah. Oh! - Good morning, guys. - It's now four days until Christmas. - Uh-huh. - And ray wet the bed. - Henry, shut up. - We discussed that yesterday. - Yes, ma'am. - Well, you guys are in luck. Today you get to have cherie's extra-special waffles. Sit down, dig in, eat up. Syrup? - You're always saying things are special, but they're not. It's just a plain waffle. - Ouch. - Well, I'm gonna respectfully disagree with you, Mike. I think... Everything is special, if you look closely enough. I thought you were gonna help me with the horses later today. Well, if you're gonna do that, you're gonna need some fuel, something in your belly to give you some energy. - Okay, there you go, Mike. That's nice. Real, real good. Look at you. You're like a real live, natural born cowboy. - Oh, please. - I really don't think Mike wants to be adopted. If he did, he'd have eaten all of his waffles. - Then why is he doing all this lone ranger stuff with the horse? - Maybe he just likes horses now. - Well, that is possible. - Hey, guys, check this out. - Both legs, there you go. Yeah. - He's making us look bad, ray. - Does it have to be war, Henry? - Hey, you want to stay in that orphanage until you're 18? - Okay, boys. This is where it all happens, where ideas come to life, where inspiration reigns supreme. - You're a genius, Mr. Jack. Seriously. - Whoa. That train is so cool. - Ah, yes, the old steam engine, once a great symbol of this country's ingenuity and also the inspiration for my dad's design. - Can I touch it? - You can do more than that, ray. You can jump inside it, play on it, whatever you like. - Did you design this truck? - I did. You like it? Okay. Well, I have an assignment for you guys. - Assignment? Sounds like school. - Okay, maybe that's a poor choice of words on my behalf. I have something for you guys to do that's going to be fun, and you're gonna enjoy it. I want each one of you to design your very own toy. - What are we supposed to make? - Whatever you like. I want you all to find your own Christmas mojo. - Christmas mojo? How do we do that? - By looking for inspiration. - Like where? - Anywhere. Everywhere. Books, toys, movies, nature, art, photography, whatever inspires you. - Okay, I'm in. Christmas mojo. Could I design, like, an ice-cream truck? - Absolutely, if that's what inspires you. - Yes. - Okay, that...That toy soldier you like so much that you sleep with underneath your pillow at night... You know where I got my inspiration for that? Those guys who guard Buckingham Palace in England, beefeaters. - How do we start? - By doing research. - On the computer? - No, no, no, not the computer. The old-fashioned way... The library. The library? - Jack. - Hi, Margo. - What are they doing here? - Research. - For what? - Toys. - Jack, there is zero tolerance for inappropriate behavior on my watch. - Well, there will be no inappropriate behavior. Right, guys? - Right. - All right, guys, i-in we go. - Hey, no peeking. Are you trying to steal my idea? - Shh, shh, shh. - You are stealing my idea! - I'm drawing a hot rod, not a truck. - Guys, guys, settle down. - Maybe you stole my idea. - See, there's proof. He doesn't want anyone to see that he's stealing my genius. - Genius? - I told you, Jack, there is zero tolerance on my watch! - They're...they're just having a discussion, Margo. - Don't push me! - You call that a discussion? - Aah! Now you're gonna get it! I'm gonna sit on you! - Oh, no! - Guys, guys! - This is just great. - Leave it to me, Jack. I know what these hooligans need...A firm hand! - No, Margo! Margo, do not lay a hand on those boys. - You can't run forever, Mike. Mike! - Uhh! - Excuse me! - This is a no running zone! There is no horseplay in this library! - You're really gonna get it now, Mike. - Henry. - I'm sick of your horseplay. Ah. You boys are so busted. - Excuse me! Coming through! - Aah! - Aah! - Are we, like, under arrest? - Well, I'm thinking about it. All right, fellas, let's get in the car. - I'm glad you stopped by. How are the renovations going? - They're great. They're fine. How are the, uh, holy terrors? - They're doing great, actually. I dropped them off with Jack at the library. You miss them, don't you? - Yes, I do. But I don't like to admit it, 'cause it ruins my tough-guy image, so don't you dare tell 'em. - Uh, hi. - Who is it, dear? - Delivery. I'll be back in a minute. Help yourself to the cookies. Hey, Dan, what's up? - It's sheriff Battleford. I'm here on official business. - Okay. Hello, sheriff. What's up? - Would you please come with me? What we had was quite a ruckus down at the library, and it was not insignificant. - Really? - The disrespect that was shown my wife is well beyond the pale. - That's not good. - Now if you and Jack can't control these kids, they're gonna be spending Christmas at the juvie hall. - Dan... I mean, sheriff, this is Centerville. There is no juvie hall here. - Cherie, you know what I mean. Jack. - Sheriff. Oh, hey, aunt Rita. Boys, wave at Rita. - Hi, aunt Rita. - The sheriff was kind enough to give Jack and the boys a ride home. - Really? - Really. Right, boys? Right. - Now why do you think god is telling me something different right now? - I have no idea. - Huh. That's strange. Hey, boys, let's go to your room. What do you say? Come on. - Hah. Ah... - Are you gonna punish us? - No, no, but I am gonna modify your assignment. - What do you mean? - I'm gonna change it. Instead of designing three separate toys, I want you guys to design one toy together, as a team. Think you guys can do that? - Okay. - Okay, good. Then I'll leave you guys here to talk about that and...and figure out how to get along, all right? So as a team, you guys can do anything. If you're fighting, then... You know? All right. - One toy? - Ice-cream truck. - Hot rod. - Airplane. - Ice-cream truck. - Hot rod. - Airplane. - Honey, can I, uh, talk to you in the kitchen for one second? - Sure, sure. Uh, do you mind? - No, why should I mind? Everybody's keeping secrets from me, but don't worry. Margaret Battleford, she's gonna tell me the truth. She can't keep a secret to save her soul. This is a lot more complicated than I thought it was gonna be. - Okay. - I mean, the kids, they're...They're great. But they've got so much going on. - Yeah. - And this whole thing, just now, at the library, honestly, I think I was having as much fun as they were. I mean, it was ridiculous, with the hair and... Well, you know, your dad always said that we all have to grow old, but that doesn't mean we have to grow up. - Yeah, I heard that a million times. - Well, he also said that it doesn't mean that we can't be responsible people. I mean, he taught you how to be responsible. - Yeah. I don't...I don't know. - Well, you're gonna figure it out. - Remember, secrets don't make friends. - Thank you, Rita. - I'll take her for a walk. - What happened last year when Mike was adopted and then returned "for a refund," as they say? - Well, there's always a trial period, and the family just didn't feel things were working out. That must have hit him really hard. - Oh ho ho... He's got grit and spirit, that one. He's always looking out for the younger kids, especially Raymond. It breaks my heart, 'cause nobody's looking out for him. - You are. I was really moved by his story... Never knowing his father, being abandoned on your doorstep, age two, with a note. - Where did you hear that? No, Jack, he wasn't abandoned, and he certainly knew both his parents. He was six when they died in a car crash. Yeah, it was a real tragedy. He was in the car at the time. He was the only survivor. - That's horrible. - Yeah. - What are you making? - I'm making some stew. You want some? - Uh, no, thanks. - I'm also making some chocolate chip cookies. - Ooh, can I help? - Mm-hmm. You can help me... Set this dough up on these cookie sheets. What you do... Just take a little bit, put it on the spoon, and you just push it off. Good. - This is fun. Maybe I'll be a chef when I grow up. - Can I ask? How did you come to the orphanage? - When I was three, my parents went away on a trip and never came back. Want to see a picture of them? I look like my dad, don't I? - Yes, you do... Very handsome. - Ever since then, miss green's been my mom and dad. Know what I mean? - Yeah. - She tries to act tough and all, but I think she likes me. - Oh, I'm sure she does. - I'll go see if Cherie needs any help. - Hey, it's almost lunchtime. Why don't you, uh, head inside and wash up? - Not hungry. - Well, cherie's stew is not to be missed, my friend. I'm a stew guy myself. How about you? Look, Mike... It doesn't matter how or when you got to the orphanage. - What? Who told you? - What's important and what matters is, is the here and now, okay? And I'm here to tell you I see a lot of potential in you. - You do? - I'll let you in on a little secret. When I was about your age, my father called me "the holy terror." - Really? - Yes, I was the original. All right. Now go get washed up. What do you say? - Yes, sir. - Hey, ray,it's lunchtime. Let's get you inside and cleaned up. What you got there? Oh, is that what you guys came up with? - Actually, we've come up with two things. - Two, huh? - Yeah, our toy design is gonna be an airplane, but this here, it's our Christmas surprise for miss green... A jewelry box... Or whatever she wants to put into it. And we want music to come on when she opens it. - I see. - We already know what we want the box to look like, but how do we get the music into it? - Well... How about we work on that together? - Okay, great. We're still working on the airplane thing. It's gonna be one of those old-fashioned kind. We saw the design in a... In a book we found at the library. It's really cool. You know, I really like this, designing stuff. - You're really good at it. - All right, now, we have an audience today, so let's do our best. Hark the herald. Lynn, please. - Mm-hmm. - ♪ Hark the herald angels sing ♪ ♪ glory to the newborn king ♪ ♪ peace on earth and mercy mild ♪ ♪ god and sinners reconciled ♪ ♪ joyful, all ye nations rise ♪ ♪ join the triumph of the skies ♪ ♪ with the angelic host proclaim ♪ ♪ Christ is born in Bethlehem ♪ ♪ hark the herald angels sing ♪ ♪ glory to the newborn king ♪ - ♪ Christ by... ♪ - Ray, this is your solo. - I just don't feel like singing right now. I can't stand being here. - Well, ray, this Christmas concert is very important to all of us. - I don't care about any stupid concert, okay? - I'll go get him. - No, Mike, you stay there. - I don't want to come back here. - I see. - It's not that I don't like you. It's just that... - I know. I know. Can I tell you a secret? - Okay. - If you don't come back, I'm gonna miss you. - Really? - Raymond, honey... I have already missed you big-time. - Rita, everything okay? - Ray... I think you can go in now. I'll be in in a sec. - You okay? I am an old fool. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. I made a terrible mistake sending the boys to your place. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did, Jack. Sending them to you for the holidays is deliberately playing with their emotions, and it's wrong, and I should have realized it before. I'm an idiot. They've been through enough. - Those boys are gonna have a great Christmas. - What happens after Christmas? - Okay, who wants to help me with dinner? - I do. - Me too. But, like, we...We got to hurry, 'cause Mr. Rodney said he was gonna help me with something after dinner. - Help you with what? - That's for me to know and you to find out. - Ray? What's Rodney gonna help you with? Ray? - Sure you don't want to help those guys make dinner? - Mr. Green? - Yeah. - I'm sorry. - About what? - Lying... About everything. I do remember my dad. He used to say I could do anything. But after the car crash, I used to close my eyes... And try to turn back the clock and bring him and my mom back, but I couldn't. And that's when I knew he was wrong. - No one can turn the clock back, Mike, but I do believe that you can do just about anything. - Then you're wrong too. And you can stop feeling sorry for me now. - I'm not feeling sorry for you, Mike. I'm just... - And one last thing... You better not hurt Ray's feelings here. - What? - 'Cause if you do, you're gonna have to answer to me. - Mike. - Well? - It's very good. - Just good? - Actually, this is very good. - It's for miss green... A surprise. Will you show me how to make it? - You know... Maybe I was wrong about you, kid. - That happens a lot. - Oh, it does? - Yeah. To look at me, most people see dweeb, maybe nerd, but I'm not. I'm just, well, me. - That you are, kid. That you are. I will show you how to make this box for Mrs. Green. First, we got to decide what kind of wood we need to use. We got pine, oak, maple, and cherry. - It's a Christmas present, so... What kind of wood goes best with Christmas? - Any kind you like, son. - Do you have any kids? - Oh, yeah, a boy and a girl. Of course, they're all grown up now. - They're lucky. - Tell me, ray, what happened to your mom and dad? - Well, when I was a baby, my dad was a fireman, and... One day he went to work, and he never came back. - Oh. - My mom said I should be proud of him. - Yes. Yes, you should. - Then one day when I was five, my mom got really sick. And when she went to the hospital, she never came back. - Oh, I’m...I'm so sorry. - It's not your fault. - No, I guess it isn't. - I just wish that... Forget it. I pick cherry. - Good choice. I'll be proud to make this box for you... For Mrs. Green. - What you working on, honey? - Oh, preparing the company's year-end statements. Do you know that profits are down 20% this year? - ♪ Dee Dee Da Da ♪ - Jack, you do that every time I try to talk to you about business issues. - I'm sorry. - I thought we were partners here. - We are. I'm sorry. - I know you're handling design and production, but do you really not want to know about what's going on with the finances? - I thought we were having a good year. - We're having an okay year. Our costs are up across the boards... Price of wood, paint, labor, health insurance. Profits are down. - Okay. What do we do? - We could try cutting back in some lines. - All right. And marketing... There's a lot more in marketing that I know I can do. - Can I leave that in your hands? - Yes, yes. I'm very, very capable. What else? - This. - See, this part of business I like. - Good night. - Good night. - What happens after they choose one of you guys? We won't be a team anymore. Is that what we want? - We'll always be a team, Mike. And we'll always be best friends, right? - Yeah, we'll always be friends, right? - It needs a bigger cockpit. - Yeah, that's good, but the propeller needs to be a little bit bigger. - Okay, how's this? - That's great, ray. - Can I just say something here? - Yeah, Mr. Jack. - I am really impressed. This is fantastic. Time to build a prototype. - What's a prototype? - Follow me. I'll show you. - Wingspan...12 inches. - 12 inches. - 12 inches. - How they doing? - They're really getting into it. - I'm gonna head to town for a little bit. Keep an eye on 'em for me? - You got it. - Thanks. - Width...3 1/2 inches. - 3 1/2. - 3 1/2. - Okay, boys, time to start cutting wood. All right. Hey, get back behind me. I don't want to get splinters in your eyes. - It's all finished. What do you think? - It's good. - Just good? - No. It's wonderful. Bravo. - Thanks. - And we couldn't have done it without Mr. Rodney. - Nope. You boys worked together on this one. You make a dynamite team. - Yeah. Jack is gonna be so proud. - Is he back yet? - Not yet. Soon. - We want him to see it. - Well, you can show it to him when he gets back. Hey, what color are you gonna paint it? - Black. - No, green. - Orange, actually. Orange? - Huh. Looks like you guys are gonna have to come to a consensus. Hey, Rodney, I need to go over the details of the Christmas Eve shipment with you. - Okay, guys, we have to choose a color. - We'll paint it black. - Green. - And don't say orange, ray. It's a warplane. It has to be black, so people can't see it in the sky. - The sky isn't black. - It's night camouflage. - That's why we have to make it green, so it can hide on the ground. - It's just a toy, guys. - There are too many green paints. It's gonna be black. - Why, 'cause you say so? It's an antique. Back then, they didn't have black planes. - What do you know? - You're not the dictator anymore. Those days are over. - Dweeb. - Dingo. - Dingo? What's a dingo? - A wild dog in Australia. - Where are you going, ray? - I'm painting it orange, and Jack and Cherie are gonna pick me. You'll see. They're picking me. - Black. - Green. - Orange. - Give us the plane back, ray. - Boys. - Hey, you know the shop rules... No running or fighting. - Ray, come on. Get back here. - Boys? - Ray? - Aah! - Jack, are you all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. - What happened? - I don't know, boys. What happened? - We were fighting. - Again. - Sorry. - Do you boys know what was in those boxes? Those were the toys that we were gonna give away to charity. - Oh. - That's not good. - All right. I want you guys to go to your room, and I want you to think about what happened, okay? Because of you guys, there's a whole lot of kids who just might not have a toy on Christmas morning. Do you understand that? - We didn't mean to. - Please, just go to your room. Go! Rodney, why don't you grab one of the guys, go through this stuff and see what can be salvaged and what can't? - You all right? - Yeah. - That was all the stock we had. We don't have a backlog for giveaways. - I know. - Hey. How are you really? - When I saw ray dart in front of my truck, all I could think about was, "please, god, don't let me hit that boy." - Okay. - Guys, it's me. Can I come in? Thought I'd bring you guys something to eat. - Not hungry. - Me neither. - Well, I might have a bite. - Listen, guys. I know you're upset about what happened, and you should be, but part of growing up is getting past that and taking responsibility for your actions. - What do you mean? - Well, it's about making amends, making things right, and thinking before you do something in the future. - Have you told miss green? - Yes. - Is she mad at us? - She's disappointed. - Are you mad at us? - No. I guess I'm disappointed too. - Jack hates us now, right? - No, that's not true. I think he's hoping that maybe you'll learn something from this, but that's up to you guys. Well, you should eat. Well, I'm eating. - Me too. - Look, the staff at the church and the community center and the orphanage, they're gonna understand. - It's not the staff we're worried about, Rita. It's the kids. - Jack and I made a commitment to donate a specific number of toys. We'd like to keep that commitment. - How about it, Rodney? Can we make up what's been lost? - Well, half the toys in the shed were destroyed. Tomorrow's Christmas Eve. We'll give it our best shot. We'll work all night if we have to. - Count me in. - Hey, what about choir practice? - Ah, we don't need any rehearsal. My kids are ready. - Can we help? - We have to make this right. - Please. - What about this one? - Save. - What about this one? - Save. - What about this one? - Discard. - This one? - Uh... - Let me see. Oh, fix this. - We'll repair that one. - There's more right here. - Well, that's the last of 'em. - Well, okay. Thank you guys all so much for staying all night... Just a fantastic job. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Well, I got a Christmas Eve dinner to cook. - Oh, honey, honey, why don't you get some rest first? - After I get the Turkey in the oven. - All right, we'll get the boys and meet you up at the house. - Okay. - Thank you, Rodney. - Good morning. - Sorry we fell asleep, Mr. Jack. - We tried to stay awake. - We just got so tired. It's okay. - Well, you boys did a great job. We couldn't have done it without you. - Really? - Cross my heart. - Rodney, why don't you get out of here? I don't want to see you here for work until after the new year, that is. - All right. Well, merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Mr. Rodney. - Merry Christmas, boys. - All right, well, I am also exhausted. Rita, you're welcome to... To crash at the house for a little while if you want to. - You know, I just might do that. - Okay, come on, boys. Let's go. - We're gonna walk up with miss Rita. - Okeydoke. - All right, boys, what's up? - Miss green, it's Christmas Eve, and we can't wait any longer to find out. - The anticipation is killing me. - Just tell us and get it over with. - Tell you what? - Which one of us is gonna get adopted. - Adopted? Where'd you get that idea? - Ray heard Jack and Cherie saying they're gonna adopt one of us. - Adopt? - Only one. - When, ray? When did you hear this? - The first night we came here. - Well, I think whatever you heard, ray, uh... You must have misunderstood, because they're... They're not adopting anyone. I-I know that it's not easy at the orphanage for you boys anymore. - It's okay, miss green. We're fine. - Yeah. Don't worry. - It was a misunderstanding. No big deal. - We're survivors. - I think you boys need some more sleep, don't you? Let's go. Let's go. We have a Christmas concert after dinner. - These people don't care about us. We're just a bunch of charity cases. I'm so out of here. I'm going back to the orphanage. That's home. I'd rather be there than with these people. Well, you guys coming or what? I thought we were a team. Guess I was wrong. Good-bye. - Wait, Mike. We're coming with you. - What was that? - Coyote. - Nothing to worry about. Are we lost? - Maybe. - Great. And whose idea was it to go this way? - Shut up. - I don't want to get eaten by wild coyotes. - That's why we have to keep moving. - We should sing. - Sing? - It'll keep the coyotes away. - Where'd you learn that? - Hey, I watch TV. - Fine. Whatever. Sing. Let's go that way. - ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of Holly ♪ ♪ fa la la la la la la la la ♪ ♪ 'Tis the season... ♪ - That table, Cherie, and that bird... You have outdone yourself. - Oh, the gravy's fine. Why don't you go get the boys? They've got a concert tonight. - That's right. They have to sing. Boys, time for dinner. Come on, guys. You still napping? Come on, wake up. Cherie's made us a feast. Guys, come on. You must be hungry. Cherie? Cherie? - Yeah? - The window is open, and their backpacks are gone. - What? - W-Wait, h-hold on. Just take a breath. - The boys, I think they've run away. - Run away? - What are you... - Yes, and I think it's my fault. - What are you talking about? - Because they...They were under the strange impression that you were gonna adopt one of them. Ray told me this. He said he heard you talking about it the first night he was here, and I said whatever he heard, he must have misunderstood. - No, we were talking about it. - What are we gonna do? - I'm calling the sheriff right now. It's gonna be fine. - Sheriff's office. - Yeah, uh, it's Jack green. Is...Is Dan in, please? - Hold it. I want to go back. - Me too, but which way is back? - We're not going back. Come on. Did those guys really care about us? - Well... - If they did, don't you think they'd be looking for us by now? - Mike has a point. - Come on. - I'm getting a little scared. Are you? - Um, actually, yes. - Are you guys coming? - This truly is my fault. - Don't beat yourself up. Easier said than done. - Rita, those boys think the world of you. If you're trying to make me feel better right now, it's not working. - Where would they go? - I don't know. The only place they know is the orphanage. If anything happens to those boys... I'll... I'll never be able to forgive myself. - Did you find anything? - No, nothing. Let's try the foothill road. You start on the south end. I'll take the north end. - Okay. - They're not bad boys, sheriff. Really, they're not. Believe me. - Thanks, Dan. - Boys! You can come out now! Raymond? - Any sign of 'em? - No. None. - Thank you for coming over. - Not a problem. - Mike? Henry? Raymond? These boys have become a part of our family. - Come on, come on, come on. - A family I never thought I'd have. - Don't do that. Come on. Don't worry, we're gonna find those boys, now. - How do you know? - If anybody can find those boys, Jack green can. And Jack green's gonna make a wonderful dad. - You're right. He will. - I'll tell you what. Why don't you go up to the house in case he calls, and I'll look around out here a little bit more. - Okay. Okay. - Now I'm getting cold... And hungry. - Me too. - Come on, guys, hang in there. - We can't stay out here all night. We'll get hypothermia. - Hypo what? - It means we'll freeze, dummy. - Oh. - They'll have to cut off all of our toes. - Gross. - Come on, guys. Aah! Aah! - Are you all right? - Ugh. I think I broke my ankle. Ah! Ah! - It's not broken. It's just a sprain. - How do you know? - Miss green told me I was smart enough to be a doctor someday. - Grab his other hand. We'll help him up. - Bad leg. Aah! - How much do you weigh? - Shut up and get me out of here. - We need rope. Then we can pull him up from the top. - Rope? We'll tie together our clothes. - Great idea. Help! We need help! - What's going on up there? - They're there. - Yeah, I see 'em. I see 'em. - Help! - Help! - Help's here, Henry! - Are you okay? - See, they do care. - Thank god. Thank god. Wait, where's Henry? - Down here. - He sprained his ankle. - All right, stay right there, buddy, okay? Stay right there. - I'm sure glad to see you again, Mr. Jack. - I'm glad to see you too, buddy. Okay. Can you walk at all? - No. - Give me your hand. I'm just gonna put your body on my shoulder here. - Ow. Ow. Ow. - There you go, buddy. - No one's ever lifted me up before. - Wow. - How does it feel? - Much better. Thank you. - Well, I've seen a lot of broken bones in my day, and that's not one of 'em. That's a sprain...Very painful, but still just a sprain. - Told you so. - Eat your Turkey, Turkey. - Those boys are really lucky. - So are we. Thanks for everything, Dan. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Jack. - That was quite a tumble you took, young man. - He bounced twice. - No, I think it was more like four times. - I wasn't counting. I was just bouncing. - Jack, are you ready to go? - Go where? - To the Christmas concert, of course. - Oh, yeah. I almost forgot about that. Sure. Yeah, I'm ready. - We have to get changed. - What about us? - Oh, honey, you don't have to sing after everything you've been through tonight. - We want to sing. - Well, but I thought you... - We're not quitters. - And even if we don't really like this whole choir thing, we made a commitment. - Yeah, you need us. You know you do. And where are you gonna find another good singer like me? - Nowhere on god's earth. - Henry, can you do this? - I'm in. I might need a little help. - We got you, partner. - Ow. Ow.

You know, maybe I do believe in Santa Claus, definitely Mr. Christmas. All right. - What is this? A gift for miss Rita. - Aunt Rita. - Aunt Rita. Of course. - Well, this is unexpected. - Well, those are the best kind of gifts. - Wonderful wrapping. Snowman, a candy cane... The boys designed and built that themselves. - It's beautiful. Thank you. You're welcome. - Okay, who wants some blueberry pancakes? - I do. - Ah, okay. But after breakfast, we're gonna head over to the orphanage and give out some gifts, because after all, - Christmas is about... - Giving. - That's right.
