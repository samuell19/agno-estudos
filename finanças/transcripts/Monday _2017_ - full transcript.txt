(giggling) I really missed you. - Wait, what are you doing here? - Uh, Jerry said that you were coming, so I came to see you. Look, I appreciate you worrying about me, but I'm fine, okay? - [Kwan] No, that's not the point. This isn't a good place. These aren't good people. - [Emma] Can we not make it about that right now? - [Kwan] Fuck, I just don't want you to be here right now. - [Emma] You can be here, doing fucking what you do.

You know if this goes legal, it's gonna get fucking expensive. - Yep, all fronts point to being heavily taxed and highly regulated. - Yeah, these weed prompts are just set up for big businesses to Walmart this shit. Mom and pops are gonna have to go to the gray market. - You mean the black and yellow market, huh? Two times. (chuckling) - [Eric] Yo, y'all hear about that dude that got smoked running from that cop with the stolen car? - [Kwan] You mean CJ? - [Eric] Yup, that CJ dude. - [Kwan] Yeah, that guy's my neighbor. His family helped us out a lot when we first moved here. - Well, that nigga got new neighbors now, and I guarantee he ain't gonna be helping them with shit. - Come on, dog, you don't got no sympathy. - What the hell he think was gonna happen, E? I mean, we black folks. We get fucked with. It's in the motherfucking cops' DNA to fuck with black folks. Shit, man, it's in our own DNA to get fucked with. - It's like the frog and the scorpion. - Frog and the motherfucking scorpion. Google it, nigga. Hey, you know you lucky God made your ass yellow and not black. - What the fuck's that supposed to mean, huh? We can be dangerous. - Yeah, when you drive. (chuckling) - Asians can't drive and blacks can't thrive. - Rae-motherfucking-Kwan over here. - Nigga, will you please stop trying to get us high? - Nigga, it's called hospitality. - [Eric] Whatever, bro. (typing) - Yep, and we are good here. - You gonna let me run some of that today? - Ha, you know it! Here you go. (typing) 250.

The big (speaking in foreign language) shit, it's going down tonight. Some (speaking in foreign language) white boys in the Hollywood hills want a shitload of coca, so get your (speaking in foreign language) ass over here with your stash. - Slow down, who's buying what? - [Nina] What the fuck, Kwan? Were you listening to me? Some Hollywood cracker ass motherfuckers want all the coke we have. - All the coke we have? Why would they know about what I got? - [Nina] Well shit, man, I don't have enough, so I just told them that, you know, you'd come through. - Them? Who the fuck is them? - [Nina] They're just some random fools that picked up some baggies last week, and now they want more shit. - How much more? - [Nina] They said at least half a fucking pound, chino, otherwise no deal, okay? - No deal? Nina, they sound like the fucking (speaking in foreign language). - [Nina] Kwan, they're not the fucking po-po! If you saw these bitch ass marshmallows, you'd know how soft they are, so get your ass over here! I fucking need this, okay? - Hey, I need this too, alright, but this sounds sketchy as fuck! - [Nina] Chino, these are just some fucking white boys trying to have a good ass time, now get the fuck over here right now, I'm not fucking around! - Nina! Nina! Fuck. - You good? - All good, sir. - Busy day? - [Kwan] Normal day. - Got anything going on? - When are you gonna stop doing that? - What's in the bag? - All kinds of shit that you don't wanna know about. - What's in the fucking bag? What the fuck is wrong with you, Kwan? - What are you gonna do? Arrest me? Let her die? - Just a matter of time, man, for both of you. - I find it so fucked up that you're a cold piece of shit, you know that? - You don't know what I have to deal with every time I see you out here. - What you have to do with? That's fucking typical. - I took a fucking oath to serve and protect. - Nobody forced you into the academy, okay? You walked in there all by yourself. - Fuck you, Kwan! - Fuck you, cuz. (slamming) (crashing) (grunting) - [Mugger] Come on, man, what do you got in the bag? Come on, give me something! Come on, man, what do you got in that bag? (struggling) (grunting) (blows landing) (groaning) (blow landing) (whimpering) (panting) Please. (intense ringing) (dogs barking) (intense music) (somber music) (coughing) (groaning) - Oh, fuck you. Mama, I'm home. (sighing) (coughing) - Hi, Kwan. How was work? What's wrong? - Just a rough day. - What happened? (coughing) - Something weird with the insurance. We have enough meds for now, so, don't worry about it, I'll figure it out tomorrow. (coughing) (cell phone trilling) - Okay. (speaking in foreign language) - Emma says hi. - How is she? - I think she's getting better. - [Mama] Poor thing. Take care of her, okay? Can we talk in the morning? (coughing) - Yeah.
