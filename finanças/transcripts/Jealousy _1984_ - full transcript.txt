[music playing] [music playing] [telephone ringing] [ringing] Georgia: - Hello? Well, uh, this is Mrs. O'Connor. Uh, can I help you? I'm afraid my husband can't come to the phone right now. Can I take a message? Uh-huh. Yes. Yes, I understand. All right. Good-bye. - No. - Oh, come on. - No. - Ah, be a sport. I'll even give you the advantage. You can have the shallow end. Hmm? - Nah. [laughs] Mom, do you wanna play? - No, no, no, no. This is one-on-one. No double-teaming allowed. Here. Catch. Ha-ha-ha. You had it, girl. - That's not fair. It's too big. - Well, you're not gonna get me in there. Not unless I can use a ladder. - Okay. - Go. No. [laughs] I'm on to you now, big man. - Oh, you are, huh? - Yes. - Is that a fact? - You all set? - Don't you think that's a little revealing? - You think so? I've worn it before. - Maybe to the beach. - Well, I'll change if you want me to. - I'd feel better about it. - Sure. Where's Daniel? - Still out by the pool, I guess. - You know something, Mom? - What? - It still feels real new. But it feels good, too. I just know everything's gonna turn out all right. - I'm glad. - Well, I'll just go throw something else on, okay? I'll just be a minute. - You had a call from your office. John called and said to tell you that the meeting that was scheduled for tomorrow morning has been pushed back to 11:00. - Okay, thanks. You look terrific. I like that dress. - Thank you. Was that a gift? - A thank you. - For what? - For Heather. She's a very special young lady. - Young lady. I guess it's about time I start accepting that. - It may be overtime. I can't believe you won't let her get her driver's license. - [sighs] I really have to stop being so protective, don't I? - You're doing fine. - Thank you. - Did Daniel tell you he's gonna start giving me driving lessons? - Really? - Mm-hmm. I will finally be able to get my license. - And then I'll be able to really start worrying. - Mother. - Oh, look. What do you think? Isn't this pretty? - Ooh. That is beautiful. And very sexy. How does it look? Great, huh? - Hmm. - Feel this. What do you think? - What do you mean? - About this. For me. - For you? - Mm-hmm. Sure. I... I'm all grown up now, you know, Mom? I'm not still mommy's little girl. So, do you think I should get it? - It's too expensive. - Well, it's not another T-shirt. - It's impractical. For both of us. - It's not just the money, is it? You're still seeing me in pigtails, aren't you? Come on now, 'fess up, Mom. - That's not it at all. I just don't see what you would want something like that for. Why you would need something like that? - Well, I'm gonna try it on anyway. I mean, what the heck? We're here, right? So why not have a little fun? - Hon, what do you think? Do you like it? - Beautiful. You're beautiful. - Mom? [car horn honking] Mother? Not exactly bargain basement. So, you wanna go look at some T-shirts? Hmm. Oh, God, I mean, they were just so insufferably young. I'm so glad that's ancient history now. - Ancient? - Well, isn't it? - Why do you think it was like that? - I don't know. Maybe it was the whole private school mentality, you know? Everybody just being so protected. [laughs] And the boys. Oh, particularly the boys. It isn't conceivable for me to think about some of them ever growing up to be men. - And just how much do you know about men? - Only that they're more together, that's all. Like Daniel. - Like Daniel how? - Well, I mean, he knows who he is, and he knows what he wants. But I bet you probably didn't when you were still in college, right? - I guess you could say that. - [chuckles] See? - What about you, Heather? Do you know what you want? - I know some things. - Such as? - Such as something we saw this afternoon. I am so bored out here. Does anybody wanna go for a swim? Help! I'm drowning. I've got cramps. I'm going down for the last time... - Hmph. - Please, help me. I'm drowning. - Yes? - I'm really drowning. [gasps] - That's it? - Please. Yes. - [exclaims] - [yelps] - [laughing] - That was it? - What? I wanna apologize for all the things that I've done. And all the things that I've said! And let me tell you one more... - It's freezing! Put me in the water. - [gasps] - You okay? - I guess I, uh... I guess I must've dozed off. I had a dream. I'm okay. Really. - You're home early. - Quiet day. - Ooh! Snazzy suit. - Mm-hmm. Feel like going for a drive? - Uh, where do you wanna go? - It's up to you. You're the one who's gonna do the driving. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Oh. - Does that mean "yes"? - Give me the keys. - What? Oh, no. You drive without the keys. - Drive carefully. - Don't worry. But I'll bet you two bits she's been driving on the sly since she was 14. - Bye, Mom. Uh, don't worry. - Don't worry. [engine revving] [tires squealing] - Hi, Bev. It's Georgia. Yeah, I'm fine. [laughs] Yes, I guess there still is life at 40. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think Heather is adjusting... very well. I, uh... [clears throat] Well, I was... I was hoping you were free tomorrow afternoon. I thought maybe we could have lunch together. Can you? Oh, wonderful. I've missed you, too. Uh... Great. Yeah. That's a good place. How's 12:30? Good. All right. See you there. Bye. [inaudible dialogue] - I'm so afraid, Bev. The way they looked at me. Like I was... an intruder. Like I didn't belong. Like I had no right to be there. In my own home. - Don't you think you're just imagining things? - Am I? I don't know why, but all of a sudden, I've started remembering the way it used to be with Frank and his little girlfriends. So awful, Bev. So ugly. Why is all that coming back to me now? But you should see Heather. She's a young woman now. So beautiful. So desirable. Why is this happening? I don't know why all this is happening to me. I'm scared, Bev. - [laughing] [girls laughing] - I hope you hang out with Jim afterwards. [indistinct chattering] Girl: - You're stupid. - Daniel thinks I'll be ready to take my test in a couple of weeks. Isn't that great? - So soon? - Well, he says I'm a really good driver. Very, um, coordinated. I can't wait. Daniel said that maybe by Christmas, and if we can afford it, I might be able to get my own car. You know, Mom, I think that this might just be the best summer of my life. - I'm glad, hon. - I mean... age doesn't really matter, does it? Just like the song says, "All you need is love." - Hi. Are you all right? - No. - What's wrong, Georgia? What is it? Is it Heather? - I don't know what it is, Daniel. Everything's just so confusing. - What's confusing? I need to know, Bev. I have to find a way to understand it. I... I need to know what's really going on. - Nothing is going on, Georgia. Nothing that shouldn't be. - How can you be sure? [sighs] I mean, believe me, I know from experience. I went through hell with Frank, didn't I? Frank and his little tramps. - What did you go through? Tell me. - You know. You were there. You were with me. Why do you want me to dredge it all up again? - Because it didn't happen the way you think it did. - What're you trying to do, Bev? Are you trying to tell me that Frank didn't run out on me? That he didn't have affairs? - I knew Frank almost as long as you knew him. I don't think he ever cheated on you, Georgia. - Never cheated on me? How can you say that? How can you possibly say that? - And he didn't run out on you either. You drove him out. And if you are not careful, you are going to drive Heather away, too. - Oh, no. No... That's not true. I wouldn't do that. I swear. Heather? Daniel? Honey? Heather? [inaudible dialogue] - Mother? - Georgia? - Mom? Mom, are you home? - Georgia? - Mother? - Hello? - Mother, we're home. - Hey. - Mom? - Anybody here? - Are you here? - Hello? - I'm gonna be going out this evening. - Oh? - My friend, Beverly. Her husband's out of town for a week. She invited me over to catch up on all the latest gossip. - Sounds like fun. -There's some steaks in the fridge. - Okay. - Did somebody say steak? I am starved. Good morning. - Hmm. Morning. I was just telling Daniel that I'm going to be going to have dinner with Bev tonight. - Ooh. Ooh! [chuckles] You wanna party? - Well, what did you have in mind? - An all-girl party. Well, except for you. Uh, okay, I've got it. A pool party, okay? - Mm-hmm. - Twenty-five... of the most sex-starved teenage girls in bikinis for you. What do you think? - Sounds exhausting. - Okay. How about dinner? Just you and me. - Uh-huh. - A little candlelight... Maybe some champagne. - Mm-hmm. - A little Bruce Springsteen on the stereo. - Mm-hmm. - And maybe even a moonlight swim. - How about a pizza and a drive-in movie? - I'll buy that. - Your daughter is such as easy sell. - Oh, hi. I was just looking for something kinda different to wear. - For what? - Well, for tonight. - [sighs] To wear to a drive-in movie? - Oh. No, no, no, no. That was just a joke. We're gonna eat in tonight. And guess who's doing the cooking? God, I hope some of your lessons pay off, Mother. I am so nervous. - I still don't know why you want something to wear. Is it that special? - Well, believe it or not, this will actually be the first formal dinner I've ever cooked for a man. That's kinda special, isn't it? I just want it to be real nice, that's all. - Candles? Soft music? - Mm-hmm. Don't you think I should? - Well, if you're planning a seduction... - I'm just really crazy about him, that's all. I just wanna be good to him, like you've been. Pretty, and sweet, and feminine. - You are all of those things, Heather, already. - Am I really? - Go on, pick out something if you want. It's okay. - Why are you so upset? - I'm not upset! Take whatever you want. I'm sorry I... I'm sorry I brought up the whole thing. - Are you sure? - Please, Heather, don't make a bigger issue out of it than it is already. - All right, all right. How long do you bake a baked potato for? - [sighs] [people chatting] [Heather laughing] [laughing continues] [laughing continues] [Heather laughing] - Mother. [screams] - You don't understand! Why won't you listen to me? I had a right to kill him! Don't you see? No, you don't understand! He was my husband and he was raping my daughter! - Not your husband, Mrs. O'Connor. Your daughter's husband. [classical music playing] - Mmm-mmm. - Ahem! I have your call from the United States, Mr. Forsyth. - Merci, Henri. This is gonna be fun. Hello, Woodward. Is that you? Yes, yes, I hear you fine. I am feeling wonderful! The vacation has been fantastic! Absolutely fantastic! I think I liked Naples the best! Probably because that's where I met my wife. He just keeps stuttering. Yes, yes! No, I'm not joking! Laura! Laura! She knocked me right out of my socks, Woodward! I never had a chance! Bachelorhood went down in flames! Yes. I know you are, Woodward, and I appreciate it. I appreciate it. Tell me how's my little girl? How is Melody? Bronc... Bronchial? What did the doctor say? What did the doctor...? Well, thank God for that! No, no, no! I'm not gonna worry! I just can't help thinking I shouldn't have left her so soon after Tom's death! Send my love to everyone on the staff, will ya? I'm fine. All right. Good-bye, Woodward. Good-bye. - Do you want to talk about it, Merrill? - No, no, no. She'll be fine. It's just a touch of the flu. Something I do. I can't help worrying about her voice. - I'm really looking forward to meeting her. But I have to tell you, I'm getting nervous about it. I mean, she's been with you 30 years. - 31. Next December. Well, take my word for it. You have nothing to worry about. There isn't a jealous bone in Melody's body. [lush music playing] - Ha ha! Good to see you! It's wonderful to see you all. Woodward: - Why, thank you, sir. And may I say what a joy it is to have you back with us. - Well, thank you, Woodward. Woodward, my wife. Mrs. Laura Forsyth. - Oh, my. She's a corker, sir. A veritable corker. Welcome, Mrs. Forsyth. Welcome to this, your new home. - Thank you, Woodward. I am so happy to be here. - Ladies and gentlemen, my bride. [regal music playing] - Oh! [laughs] [Mendelssohn's "Wedding March" playing] - Melody? I'm home! Melody? Daddy's home! - Honey? [squawking] Oh, Merrill! She's even more beautiful than you described her. - She is. Let me introduce you. Melody, I want you to meet the only other woman in my life. This is... Look, it's Laura, my bride. - Aw! Can I... Uh, should I... - Speak? Yes, speak to her. Yes. - Melody, I'm so happy to meet you. Oh! - Now stroke her breast very gently. [squawks angrily] Oh! [squawks] Where's my little girl? Give me a kiss. Melody: - Daddy's girl. [squawks] [classical music playing] [Melody squawks, whistles] - Pardon me, sir. - Good wine. - Has she always eaten with you? [squawks] - Well, uh, not with company, of course. - Of course. - But, uh, generally, yes. Yeah. [squawks] She's very well mannered, don't you think? [Melody squawks] Melody: [off-key] - ♪ O say can you see ♪ By the dawn's early light ♪ You're the only girl for me. - [laughs] - [squawks] Daddy's girl. Daddy's girl. [whistles] [Melody squawks angrily] - Shh. Daddy's home, little girl. Go to sleep. Woodward: - I trust you'll have a very pleasant day, sir. [chatters] - Melody, I'd like for us to be friends. Now, I think it's very important that we try to be friends. I know I've been here only a short time, and you've been here for 30 years, but... - 31! - I'm sorry. 31 years. But the point is... I love Daddy. I love Merrill. Merrill. Very much. And I want the three of us to be friends. [angry squawking] Now, settle down. It can work. - You're the only one for me. [squawks] Mommy's Suzie. - Laura. The name is Laura. [whistles, squawks] Would you please climb up? - Not really. - Come on. Can't we be friends? Try it. Come on. Step up. Step up. Come on. Step up, honey. Oh, please? Step up. Come on. Yes. You did it. Oh, what a nice girl. Oh, you sweet, beautiful thing. Now, the three of us can be friends. Oh, you're so beautiful... - Go away! Scram! [squawks, whistles] Daddy's girl. [classical music playing] [squawking] - [chuckles] - [giggles] - I have something for you. - You're too good to me. - Go on. Open it up. I wanna see that glow in your eyes. - Oh! Oh, it's beautiful. - Come, put it on. No, let me, let me, let me help. - [giggling] [Melody squawks, whistles] [squawks] I have to see how it looks on. - Right over there. [Melody whistles, squawks] [squawking] - No, no, no. Oh, no. I haven't forgotten you, my girl. I have something very special. For you, my love. Look at this, my sweet Melody. Oh, yes, yes, yes. Look. It's handmade, custom-made. One of a kind for Daddy's very favorite little girl. Merrill: Look at that. Look at that. Look. Look. For Daddy's very favorite little girl. [clicking tongue] It's a little anklet. For Melody. Right over here. Come here. Let me put this... Yes, let me put this... There we go. Ah, isn't that nice? Oh, yes. Oh! Oh! A little anklet for my little Melody's ankle. Let me see. Oh, you're gorgeous! Look how pretty you look. And your nails are so beautiful. Melody: - Thank you, Daddy. - Give Daddy a kiss. No tongue. No tongues. [Melody whimpers] - Shh. [Melody continues whimpering] What's wrong? She'll be all right. It's okay. She'll be all right. She'll be fine. [Melody squawks] She'll be fine. She'll be fine. She will. She will. She will. - Merrill, I can't. - Yes... [Melody whimpers] - Merrill, I can't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Maybe you could move the cage? [Melody sneezing] - Daddy's here, little girl. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you. I better get her a little more medicine. [Melody moaning] - Oh! Melody: - Daddy's girl. Daddy's girl. [squawks, sneezes] - Well, we will be anxiously awaiting your return tomorrow, sir. Bon voyage. - Thank you kindly. - Your briefcase, sir. - Thank you. - Good-bye. [drumroll] [drumming] [drumming] Melody: - Uh-oh. - All right. Daddy's gone. And it's you and me, kid. We're gonna be friends. Starting now. Understand? [squawking angrily] Steady. Come on... Get back here. Melody, come... Come back here. Oh, no! Hey, don't... Oh, oh! [squawking] Come back here, you miserable pile of feathers! Oh, no! Stop her! Melody: - Bonsai! Geronimo! Melody: Tom, is that you? [squawking] [glass shatters, screaming] [inaudible dialogue] [dramatic music playing] [footsteps approaching] [lush music playing] [music ends] - [sighs] I really did love her, you know? - And she loved you. - I buried her next to Tom beneath the willow tree. - She would've wanted that. - I mean, they were so very close. [chuckles] Tom. Tom was trouble. I mean, he hated Ralph. Just hated him. - Ralph who? - They fought like cat and dog. You should've seen 'em. And then it came to me. - What did? - We could have Ralph again. I mean, now that Tom is gone and Melody is gone. Why not? What do you think? Shall we give it a try? Ah, I love you! Ralph? Ralphie? [whistles] Ralph? [footsteps pattering] [door opens] Daddy's boy! [Merrill exclaiming] [Ralph laughs] - [sighs] [blows raspberry] [country music playing] [country music playing in bar, people chatting] - Don't walk out on me, Ginny. Please. - It's over, Bobby. This time for good. You gotta let go now. [engine starting] [people chatting] [country music playing] - How'd it go, honey? - It's over. My mind's made up this time. - You sure about that now? - I swore it to myself, Dixie. This time it's for real. - Gotta go. See you later, honey. [clicks tongue] - Yeah.

I thought we could talk. We should talk. Last night was some kind of hell for me, lemme tell ya. I just don't think I can make it without you. And I learned one thing. I can be a better... A better man. I know that now. - Bobby... - Look, just let me finish. - No! We've been through it all before. And I've heard it all before. It wasn't any different then and it won't be any different now. I don't wanna live with a jailer, Bobby. I don't wanna be locked up anymore. I gotta breathe. - You just gotta be willing to give it one more chance, one more try. We have tried, Bobby. Lots of times. We tried last month. And the month before that. But it always ends up the same. Just like it always will. I want you to leave me alone now, Bobby. We each have our lives to get on with. And they've gotta be separate lives. From here on out. Good-bye, Bobby. [car engine starting] Think that's gonna do it, Ginny? - It's a start. You remember what I told you the last time. I said, "Ginny, don't pack 'em. Burn 'em." - [snickers] - The only way you're gonna get that guy out of your life, and I mean for good, is to show him point-blank, right between the eyes, you can get along without him. - You think he hasn't thought of that? Don't think that's what he's afraid of? - Yeah, well, knowing it and seeing it are two different things. You can't just tell him, Ginny. You gotta advertise, honey. You gotta hold a great big neon sign up in front of him. You gotta walk down the street, right past his store, with the biggest hunk you can find right by your side. With a man like Bobby D., there's no other way. I'm on your side, Ginny. All the way.

They didn't tell me she was that pretty, though. - Well, whoever they are, oughta have their eyes examined. - Uh, are you a personal friend of hers? - Thick as thieves. We room together. You taking a census or what? Ooh-la-la. Nashville? - Some friends of mine just happened to stop in here a few weeks ago.

What do you got to lose? - What if he asks me to go to Nashville with him? - Ginny, it's okay. Take my word for it, will ya? You been hiding behind Bobby's shadow for so long, you're like a little kid on her first date. I'm your best friend. I would not steer you wrong.

I don't want you calling at all, Bobby. - I saw him touch you. - Bobby... - All these years, there wasn't never anybody else. Not for you, not for me. I could never love anybody else. You hear what I'm saying to you? I got a pain in my heart that I feel all day long, burning like an iron. You understand what I'm saying to you? You hear me? I can't live like this! You're mine, Ginny. I ain't gonna let you go. Not ever! You hear what I'm saying to you? Ginny? You listening to me? Ginny? Answer me! [yelling] [yelling] [glass shattering] I'll kill you! [yelling indistinctly] [train passing in distance] [engine starting] [engine revving] [tires screeching] - Good afternoon. Right pretty set of wheels you got here. I wouldn't mind having one of these buggies for myself. That's mine over there. Pretty little thing, ain't she? - Do we know each other? - [chuckles] Well, I suppose so... in a manner of speaking. Bobby Duchamps. - What were you doing in my car, Bobby? - Well, it seems like there's been a little misunderstanding, partner. I just thought maybe I better clear it up before it went any further, anybody's feelings got hurt. - I'm not following you. - I'm talking about Ginny. - Ginny? What about her? - She's my fiancée. - Congratulations. What does that got to do with me? - Well, we had sort of a lover's quarrel, and the lady kinda got upset. And that's where you came in. But this morning, we sort of kissed and made up. You know what I mean? - Well, I appreciate you coming down here and sitting around in my car just so you could tell me that. I hate to disappoint you, buddy, but the plain fact is that don't mean diddly to me. - Well, it better mean something to you. - I don't owe you this, buddy, but I'm gonna give it to you as a favor. You've got your property, and I've got mine. And the next time you put your dirty feet on my seat, I'm gonna knock 'em off with a crowbar. - I want you gone, mister. - Why don't you grow up, buddy? It so happens I'm leaving here this afternoon, but only because I've done what I came to do. Ginny knows where to find me if she wants to. - Don't shoot. - Que paso, Bobby? - Howdy, Tom. Hi, Johnny. - Hey, Bobby. - Not buying today, huh? - Oh, I'd love to, Bobby. But to tell you the truth, if I come home with one more toy like that, my old lady's gonna make me eat it. [all chuckle] - Boy, don't married life sound like fun. - Yeah. - I thought I saw Ginny last night out with that Southern boy in the red Caddy. You two ain't breaking up again, are you, viejo? - Better have yourself checked out for glasses, Tom. You're seeing things. I'll say one thing, though. You know, if there's a woman in this town as half as good-looking as Ginny, he'd be a fool not to try and bag her, wouldn't he? - Amen to that, Bobby. [knock on door] [knock] - I got us a reservation at the Horseshoe. That little table by the fireplace where we ate that first night. Remember? I guess you wanna freshen up a bit before we go. You'd better put these flowers in some water. - I called Jessie Hutton at the Lodge, and they said he checked out. Did you go and see him, Bobby? Did you fight with him? - Oh, honey, I don't wanna talk about Jessie Hutton. Listen, this night's gonna be magic. It's gonna be just like old times. Good food, good wine, maybe even a little champagne. And we'll talk. We'll straighten things out. Come on, honey. How's that sound, huh? What do you say? - Get out of here, Bobby. - Look, don't you wanna put these flowers in some water? We don't want 'em to die on us, do we? - I don't want your damn flowers. - [grunts] Honey, we gotta talk. - You don't listen! What's the use? - Well, I will. I will. Just try me. Go on. Go ahead, say something. Tell me something. - All right. There's a chance, Bobby, just a chance that I'm gonna get out of here. - What do you mean getting out of here? How? Why? - Jessie Hutton. That man, he's a record producer from Nashville. He likes the way I sing, Bobby. He likes the way I look. He says he's gonna talk to his partners about getting me a signed contract. - I don't wanna hear this! Ginny, I don't wanna hear it! I don't wanna hear about some pie-in-the-sky story from some producer from Nashville! - You asked me! Bobby! You asked me! - I don't wanna hear about it! Ginny, I love you. - [sobbing] Damn it. Stop telling me that! - Well, what do you want me to do? Lie about it? What am I supposed to do? Lie and say I don't when I do, after all this time? - It's over, Bobby! Can't you see that? Can't you see I don't want you to love me? - Well, that just ain't how it works. Now, love is not a thing that you want or you don't want. It's just a thing that grabs you, and it doesn't matter whether you like it or you don't like it. And it hugs you like a bear, and it doesn't matter what you do or what you want! - Oh, Bobby! - Ginny. Ginny, I... Hey, I know I'm not perfect. I'm not even the best prize on the ring toss. But you'll never be loved, Ginny, not in your whole life, even half as much as you're loved by me. - Oh! - Oh, honey. - Get out, Bobby. Get out. - No, stop. No, Ginny. - I don't want you here. - Please. - Don't touch me. I don't want you. Don't touch me. - Ginny! - I don't want you touching me! - Ginny! - Don't! Don't! I'm calling the sheriff. - Gimme that! Just gimme that! Gimme that! - [gasps] - I can't live without you, Ginny. And I ain't gonna. - What're you trying to tell me, Bobby? What are you trying to say? That you're gonna kill yourself? Is that it? Bobby, Bobby Duchamps is gonna kill himself because he can't get his way! Well, what do you think that's gonna prove? That you still love me? That a dead man still loves me? - [yells] - [screaming] [crying] [engine revving] [crashing] Bobby! [car engine accelerating] Bobby! Bobby! Stop that! Aah! Bobby! Bob... Stop that! Bobby! Bobby! [tires screeching] [sobbing] - Well, that's some kind of mess all right. What do you figure it'll cost to put it right? - I'm not looking for money, Sheriff, just to be left alone. - Well, I gotta be honest with you, Ginny, there's not an awful lot I can do about it. Oh, sure I'll talk with Bobby and quiet him down some. Shoot, I've known Bobby Duchamps for close to 20 years. He's hot-tempered, yeah. Oh, old Tom and I have seen that more than a few times, haven't we, Tom? - He's talking about killing himself. - Bobby? - [Tom laughs] Bobby Duchamps' gonna commit sideways. [laughing] [mimics gun shot] That's the funniest thing I heard all year. - I wouldn't count on any help from the law, Ginny. Not when they hire jackasses! - I said I'd talk to Bobby, that's what I'll do. There's no need for any name-calling. [chuckles] The thing that surprises me about all this is how little you ladies seem to understand. - Aw, is that so, Sheriff? Well, now why don't you tell us just what it is that we don't understand. - Passion. A man like Bobby Duchamps is one in a million. One in 10 million. [laughs] Hell, Ginny, she'll find herself another boyfriend easy enough, but she'll never find another Bobby D. That man's got more love inside him than any 10 women could ever use up. He's got a fire burning in him. And all that heat aimed straight as a bullet at this young lady right here. And that's righteous heat, lemme tell you. If you don't want it, well, that's up to you. But in all my life, I only wish I could've felt just half of what Bobby feels for you. Good day, ladies. [door closes] - How you doing? - Fine. - Well, I got good news and bad news. Which do you want first? - Good. - Bobby's not out front. - Thank God. What's the bad? - The night is still young. - Thanks a lot. - The sheriff's gotta have talked to him by now. - Yeah, one good old boy to another. - Think positive, honey. - I'm trying, Dixie. - Ooh, did you talk to Jessie Hutton yet? - Nope. Not yet. - Now, why on earth not? - 'Cause I haven't decided yet. It's a big decision, Dixie. It's not easy. - And staying in Fire River is, huh? - Just... I just have to think about it. I need a little time. - Okay, honey. We going home together? - Safety in numbers. - Meet you out front.
