Humanity is getting closer to the truth, to us. We won't let that happen. - Ok. I got to go. Bye. It wasn't there before. - Huh. Weird. Why's the door open? Oh, come on. You kidding? Where did that come from? I, oh jeez, look at, look! What happened here? Seriously? I. Wow. Where did this come from? Do you know? Yeah I do know. It's, it's Steve. This is ridiculous. Look at the place. Look at the place! This is bizarre. - No, it's not bizarre. It's what happens when you let Steve, hold on. This is ridiculous. - Yeah, don't touch it. Look at this place! What's going on? I'm gonna call him again. The Camera? - Steve, you need to, hold on! Steve, you need to call me back right now, this place is a wreck. Call me back, right now. - A little. I mean. Hello! You ready? Flux Capacitor. Hey, you got that extra thingy, right? You ordered it? You want to explain what is going on here? - This is where we're going to conduct our experiment. And we have, well all your cameras are set-up, which I, there's a lot of them. Alright. Don't wanna miss anything. - Striking. - You switched out these fuses, right? It's kinda weird. I don't, I don't know what am I supposed to like? Nah, just do your thing. Just do-- - Why don't you give me the camera? Why don't you explain to everyone what else you've brought us? - Okay, well, follow me everyone. Over here we have my baby. Now this is a refurbished customized beta-model Specter v62 video camera. This is the only kind that can simultaneously record and playback super slow motion video. Now you know why we hired you. - Yeah, I get it. Look, as long as I get to direct this shoot with all of my cameras and get exclusive rights to this little seance, I'm good. Straight down the lens, yeah. Whenever you're ready. - I'm Nicole Fallek. I am a doctoral student in experimental and applied physics. And your relationship with Martin Callahan is? - I am Professor Callahan's teaching assistant. And I don't appreciate the implication. - My name is Martin Callahan. Tenured Professor of Applied Physics at CAL-tech and the youngest winner of the Selder prize. You also have a master's in theology. Would you say that your experiences in seeing a demon were somehow divinely related? - I don't really call them demons. I prefer to call them transdimensional entities. You mean they've experienced what's known as night terrors? - Night terrors, yeah. Night terrors is the western scientific explanation, that we are awaking paralyzed in REM sleep and somehow hallucinating these evil entities. Right, so if that is the case, then why is it that every culture, every single culture, that we have interprets it the exact same way? - Time dilates in REM sleep by a factor of 10 to 1,000 depending on the individual and brain waves. So what we perceive as 10 to 1,000 seconds in dream time is only one second in real or awake time. - These entities, plus ghosts and spirits, operate on a different time dilation. Somewhere on a factor of 1,000 and 10,000. So for every 1,000 to 10,000 seconds of theirs, or 16 minutes to three hours in their time, is equivalent to one second of ours. - The human eye can perceive detail in a lit environment up to 1/100th of a second. In darkness, we can perceive a flicker of light if it is 1/200th of a second or longer. Anything shorter than 1/200th of a second, in our normal conscious state, we don't perceive at all. It's as if it isn't there. But it is there. We just can't see it. - If we awake in a REM state, our brain waves and perception are still in a time dilation. So we're actually able to still see, although very temporarily, what was once invisible to us. - That's why we only see transdimensionals for a brief second in our normal conscious state. They would have to stand still for 16 minutes to three hours in their time for us to see it for one second in our time. - Have you ever been to the Grand Canyon? No, no. Because I can't describe to you how big it actually is because there's no frame of reference. I can't put that in perspective to make sense to you. Okay, that's the way this is. I can't put it into perspective, okay, how much fear it is when someone wakes in REM sleep and actually sees one of these entities. I can't put that into perspective. Okay, all of this. This is science. Okay, this is science. Everything is science. It's not superstition, okay? It's not magic, hocus pocus. This is science. And this is what we're gonna try to find out. These entities, plus ghosts and spirits, operate on a different time dilation. - Captain's log, star date 2013.11.19. 3,000 miles, five days, weary travelers through the backwoods of our great country to land on a new starship and a new home with my lovely wife. Say hello. Girl you will find out. One second. Ta da! Welcome home baby. - Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh! This is, this is beautiful! Glad you love it. - Oh my gosh, it's furnished. I understand some of the secrecy last month. Maybe later. - Alright, cool. - Okay. So. Well in that vein let's go downstairs 'cause that's where the bedrooms are. Oh! Downstairs. These are upside down houses in the hills. - Oh. And this, this rail. The wrought iron? - Yeah, the wrought iron. Like look at that, that is so beautiful. I just wanna stay in the spiral staircase. Here, let me get the light for you. Okay. - Wow. This is our master bedroom - Very nice. It's where the magic will happen. I think it will. To be determined. - Oh my gosh. Oh this bathroom. Why is there plastic? The owner was doing painting during renovation. - I love it when there's a separate shower. More storage, there's tons of space. And another bathroom here. Yes, another bedroom. Perfect place. - I'm in shock! Can you believe it? And this wraps back around to where we just came from. - I know where I wanna end the tour. - I think it worked. Hold the sexy pose, baby. We've been here for three days. - I understand this woman. What do you mean you understand this woman? You do understand this woman. - This is a very oddly furnished house. It's not oddly furnished. What was that? Did you set those on the edge? I don't use toothpicks much. - Wait a minute, David, what just happened? David? Oh my god. It's going, it's going. Did you hear it again? Yes. It's on the ceiling. - It's on the ceiling, what are you talking about? Well I could hear it. It sounds like footsteps. - We don't have a floor. It started with a thump thump, like before. But now. - That sounds like somebody's walking on the ceiling. Exactly. - But there's no floor above, so. That's on the roof, that's really weird. That's really weird. - It could be a rat or something. I'm suggesting we try to document this. We keep the camera on as much as we can. - Oh my god. - That's just so invasive. - I don't have an idea. I'm upset about what's going on. - We just need to have it nearby, so that we can document this stuff. We need to show somebody this. How are we gonna show them if we don't have the camera on. - It's like a thump, but not a thump. It's not a bump, it's really -- Like a shoe thump? - No, no. It's like a muffled sharp thump. That sounds, I know it's contradictory, but the weird thing is, and this is what I wanna know if you had heard it. It's like, it's right in this space. In this kind of, wait wait! Did you just hear that? Let's be quiet for a second. - Okay, see. It was there. - Yeah. What if it's the house settling, I mean that's gotta be, no? - No, cause it's been consistent. Cause I heard two yesterday, and before that on Thursday, I heard, but I haven't heard any one until here. I was hearing them in the living room. But that one right now was just right here. - And we haven't heard them at the same time until now. Come here, come here. Watch this. Whoa, alright what? But cool! Does it? - Watch this ball. Okay here is the lovely living room. With a gorgeous view. Where the majority of the upstairs activity, is happening. Okay then downstairs in the hallway, is where the majority of the, this is the hallway, where most of the downstairs activity is happening. Okay, just like that. That sound. That's what I'm talking about. Oh my god, see? Those things were over here. This just happened, this is really freaking me out. Okay. I don't wanna be here anymore. I'm done with this. What? Okay. I think we should get out of this house. Come here, come here. Hi, I'm David Katil, and this is my wife Karen. We need help. Not normal help, we need ghost hunters, paranormal investigators. I'm not sure what you call yourselves, but we need your help. Ever since my wife and I -- - David. - Okay. Whatever it is, it's gotten physical. Here. That's the fourth night I've woken up with that on my back. There's something here. Please help us. Please come. Soon. - Oh my gosh I'm so psyched about this one. I think this is the one. This is the one we've been waiting for. Don't you think so? My intuition bell's ringing off the hook. I'm telling you, big time. It's gonna be great. This couple's fantabulous. The network, they're gonna love them. They're young, they're attractive, they're in love. They're so much like my third husband and I. Are you recording this? Nope. - The red light's on, Geoff. It's because the battery's low. - You sure you're not recording this? I am certain. - I don't look good in a close up, you know that. I do know that. - This one here. 2062. Do I look okay? Hi. Nice to meet you. Thanks. - Yeah, yeah. This is Cameron, he's my director. Hey, how you doing? - And that's Geoff. He's my technician. - Please. - Okay so I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions now for our actual interview, if that's okay? Are you feeling up for that? You've never ever had anything like this happen to you before? When you were living anywhere else before, or? - No, no. - Any strange, different things that you might have noticed? Any experiences? Recent deaths in the family? Mom, dad? Nothing like that? How long have you done this for? - About six, seven years now. We've seen some intense things. Some hectic cases. Like this stuff? - You know you guys are extreme, What can I tell you? The physical situation with you is worrying, it is. But we've dealt with some really, really strong spirits. And we've done a good job so far. People have been okay. - But have you ever seen anything like this? You know it's definitely negative. It feels negative. It definitely feels like there's something here. It's okay, it's okay. - I know, I know. - Yeah, I'd say it's negative. - Yeah it is, but. You know, sometimes they just need to be spoken to. Sometimes you just need to explain to these, these beings, for a lack of a better term, that this is no longer where they belong. This is not their dimension. They just struggle to take that step, to move on. They don't realize they've actually passed. And you've kind of just entice them and invite them and tell them it's safe. - It's, it's -- - It's gotten to that point. - It's weird, it's evil. I was pushed down onto the couch. It's, you know, something is clawing his back. This is bizarre, This is, this isn't just you know -- - What you need to know you're not crazy. That's what you've got to know, you're not crazy. This is very real. It exists. - David and Karen are here, over. Roger that. - It's full tonight. You know, this is a good time for us to be here. Point three. If that was you, make that noise again, we want to hear it again. Did you hear it? No, was that Geoff? Is he downstairs? - Come to this device I have in my hand. We wanna help you. It's just a little chillier. It's slight, but it's here. We're not here to harm any of you. Don't be afraid. Show us again that you are with us. Oh man. Can you hear that? The chair's rocking. Did you hit it? - No, I didn't touch it. Hey. Okay, it's late, we're just gonna call it a night and all get some sleep. We'll do our background research on the place tomorrow and then come back at night. - Yeah, some possibilities. We'll let the cameras keep recording while we're gone, so you two behave yourselves. David! David! Karen? Karen? Stop. - It can't be. It can't be her. Why is she here David? I thought this was over. I can't go through this again. - I, um. I'm sorry. Karen didn't want me to tell you, she refuses talk about it. But, um, three years ago we lost our daughter Ashen. Karen's, she's in denial. She can't handle it. I'm sorry. - We need to do an E.V.P with these two now. I think there's a couple of things that we can do, but most importantly I think we should do an E.V.P. with the two of you immediately. I think there are two entities in this house. One, quite obviously, is your daughter Ashen. The other one, is a negative presence, I feel that it's trapping her, kinda holding her back, stopping her from being able to move on. Time is of the essence, we should do this right now if that's okay with the both of you. - Ashen, I'm with your mother and father, can you come to us? Speak as loud as you can for us. Your parents miss you. Your mother misses you, your father misses you, they love you very much. Karen, call to your daughter, she needs you. - I can't. - You must tell her to call out to us. - Ashen. It's mommy. I need you to come to us. Tell her to scream as loud as she can. - She was always very quiet. - We need to know that she's here, tell her! - Ashen, scream for mommy. Scream real loud. Daddy and I miss you very much. - Ashen, it's Daddy. Are you with anyone? Are you okay, honey? We can't hear you Ashen, speak louder. Your mommy can't hear you. What's wrong? Ashen, are you hurt? Is someone? - Karen. - Just everyone leave me alone. - No, no, no David. Just let her go. Geoff, I need you to get to the bedroom hub now. I heard your daughter, she said she's being held downstairs against her will. I think we have a way that we can flush this being out that's holding her there. - Yeah, but it's theoretical, I mean -- Why's it theoretical? - It's dangerous, it hasn't been done before. - Cameron, I need you upstairs to capture it in IR. This is the one we've been waiting for. David, come with me, your daughter needs you. Geoff, Susan, are you there? Susan, do you copy? Over. C'mon. Geoff? Susan? What the hell? Karen? David? Hey Geoff? Geoff? - Wakey, wakey. You ghost hunters, quite a group aren't you? Complete strangers call you guys up, and you believe everything they tell you, you go right to their house, spend the night. No research, no background checks, nothing. You guys are idiots. Sweetheart, not you, him. - I'd say he's doing better than the others. You know, we both actually thought you were kinda alright. The other two, nobody will miss. - Mmm, no. - But your team, I mean come on. You guys didn't no research on this place. - There were two murders in this house. - Two murders, how do you miss that? We had so much spooky crap set up for you guys. - You would have really liked it. Much better than the special effects in the videos that you saw. It's really amazing what people can do with After Effects. - Or even just some fishing-line, few speakers, and a bunch of morons that are ready to believe anything you tell them. - Daddy, when do I get to kill someone? - Aw, come here, babydoll. - Let me get the camera, this is her first. Here you go, come down right over here, okay? Let's wait for mommy. Honey, first off, I am so proud of you-- We. Sorry, We are so proud you. Mommy and Daddy, Ashen you did such a good job-- - Thank you mommy. - It was great. Everything, all the running around and hiding. - It was fun. - Okay. - Yeah. - You know what, let's do this one together, what do you think? - Okay. - Okay, here. Hold real tight around my hands. Good. What'd we say, Seattle next? Uh, yeah! Seattle, I'm so excited. I'm so ready for Seattle. Me too. Pacific Northwest, it's gorgeous. Don't step on Cameron's hand. Five, four, three, two, one. That was anti-climatic. So what do we do now? - Now we wait. It'll be about 90 minutes until he's in REM sleep. Okay, so what's going on now? - Well, looks like he's asleep. The first REM sleep is the shortest, about 10 minutes. We'll just keep forwarding to real time every few seconds til we catch something. - So you fall behind because of playback speed, skip ahead to current time, review again, instantly fall back, review, skip ahead again, then review. - Right, right. Kind of like paying the minimum on your credit card. We can always go back and review it all later. But this way we can try to catch something while he's sleeping. What? I've never seen that before. That was moving extremely fast. Slow down the frame rate. - Right. - We don't wanna miss anything. - Oh my, I don't believe it, it's here. - It was definitely here at least 15 seconds or so before you woke up. - Okay. Stop right here, stop right here, go. Right there. It's casting a shadow, which means, - It has mass. - It has mass. Okay, uh, go ahead play it back, keep going. Okay, no no, stop right there. Back it up one frame. Now go frame by frame. Go frame by frame. Jesus. That thing could have been standing right next to me. - That's it right there. We need to go ahead and move to phase two, uh, Nicole uh, play this through, skip through in a real time review, and see what we get. Anytime you see a straight line or a blurred line, anything that looks unordinary like that, let's power up to 8.5. We haven't tested the capacity in this place. And the radiation at 8.5-- - Is within the safety limits, it's fine. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What radiation? - The safety limits if you haven't been subjecting yourself to it during the testing phases, yes, but 8.5? What radiation? - We'll be fine, it's 1/10th of a chest x-ray, which is gonna dissipate rapidly from the center which is 100 times stronger, which is exactly where Martin's gonna be at. Are your cameras rolling still? How long is it gonna take him to fall asleep now? - Martin's trained himself, so, if he wants, it won't take long at all. Should be quick. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - This whole thing, 8.5 in untested outlets. Martin, wake up! Wake up Martin, wake up! Jason, do you see anything? Forget this, man! C'mon, c'mon! This door won't open! It's not even locked, it's just not budging! Wait! Wait, stop stop stop. Do you see anything Jason? Where is it?! - I did not sign up for this, man! - Stop, stop stop! - C'mon, get it open! Quiet, quiet! Shut up! - Give me light, give me some light on the door! I got to go, I have to get my phone! Wait, where are you going!? Martin, where are you? Martin? Oh god! He is with me. He has always been with me. For we are eternal. - Let him go! You do not command me. I am no simple flesh eating ghoul from your pathetic realm. Release me from this spell. - I, I can't release you, there's nothing turned on. You shouldn't be here. Help me get this thing down! He's already gone, we got to leave! C'mon! Oh shit, oh shit! - He's behind me! Run! I am no simple flesh eating ghoul from your pathetic realm. - Hey. - I saw you were online. You got a minute? - Yeah, I'm just doing some studying. Everything okay? - Yeah, everything's going alright. I just wanted to ask you a question since you're practically a doctor now. - Shoot, and don't leave out any details. - Well, that's the thing, not much to tell. Except that I've been having these blackouts for the past 10 days, every single night. I can't remember going to bed or coming home. - And these nights you're going out are you drinking? - Yeah, Sindy's in a party mode. So, she wants to go out every single night. I don't wanna be rude, so, I go along. - No, of course not. That's the weird thing, is that on the nights that I'm staying home I don't remember going to bed. And I've been tired and I'm having trouble concentrating. I don't know, I just don't feel right. Sexsomnia? - Sexsomnia. It's like sleep walking, but sleep sex, you just don't remember it like sleep walking. - No, no sexsomnia between Sindy and I. But, how would I even know if I don't remember? You're making it up. - I'm not, I swear, it's a legit condition. Google it. Google it. - Sexsomnia, okay, please. - Look, the nights you are having blackouts and you're not drinking those could be a cause for concern if they do continue, but lack of sleep from going out, fatigue and stress they could be the cause of those. The nights you are drinking and you're having blackouts, I would definitely say that's the alcohol. we metabolize it a little differently when we get older, and you could be just a lot more sensitive to the effects of it. - That could be part of it. You and Sindy good? You still a couple? - We're still a couple, yeah. - Alright, I'm just saying. I'm gonna be a doctor soon. So, let me know if you plan on switching sides again. Is everything else okay? - I have this video on my phone from the other night when we went out. - From one of the nights you don't remember? - Yeah, and I'm doing things and saying things that aren't me. Crazy stuff. - You know they say that's why they call liquor "spirits", because the crazy stuff you do when you're drunk is because you were possessed by spirits. - That sounds like some religious crap my parents would say. - Sorry, I know that's why you left. - But I was doing some really weird and scary stuff. I mean, I moved out here to be wild and grow and be normal and break away from all that embedded church stuff, but not like that. Hold on. Spirit comes from the Latin word spiritus which means breath and also the essence of something. Alcohol comes from the Arabic word Al-Kuhl, which is a flesh eating monster that feeds on the dead. Al-Kuhl also became the English word ghoul which is an evil flesh-eating demon that can influence or posses weak-minded individuals. - Well Miss ghoul, I would just say lay off the liquor, and get a good nights sleep and you should be okay. - Sindy's home. I'll call you tomorrow. - Alright, be good. And take care of yourself. - I will, thanks again. Hey. - Hey. Who you talking to? - Alec, my friend from back home. I told you about him. - Does Alec maybe want to come, visit us? - I don't wanna hook-up with him or anyone right now. This is all really new to me. - You mean being with me, a woman? - Yeah. And I know that we're still into guys, but, I just wanna be with you and only you. Is it possible that we can go out drinking like two, three times a week, like normal people? Listen. Do you remember when you called me up and you wanted to come out here and you said that you wanted to be exactly the opposite of that good little Christian girl that your parents raised? Do you remember that? Hey! - Of course. - We're making great money doing the cam show, aren't we? - Yes. - You did. - That's right. So trust me. I know what's best for you. Before we get the cam show going, um, I want you to get one of the guys to do something outrageous first. Why? - Trust me, this is part of me teaching you how to get what you want and not be such a pushover. You know what'd be hot? If you got him to cut himself a little. - Because it would turn me on and the fact that you just said ew means we're definitely doing it now. Lets go get dressed up and ready for our show and make a quick thousand dollars, and go out and party like rock stars, okay? - Hi Zack. - Hey Caitlin. - Hey Rick. Jerry, looking good. Jim, what's up? And Zoe. Guys, we have a hottie watching with us. And finally Eric, right on time. - I'm packin' and ready for action! Woooo! Where's your friend, lets get this 'ho on the road. - She's coming. You know the rules Eric, Sindy will pick who we're giving the free show for, but no talking while we wait. - Ooh, Sindy with an S, I like that. - Shut up dude, she said no talking. - Hi everybody! - Alright, I'm ready to go Hans Solo on Darth Vader's head, got my lube right here-- - That's what happens when you don't play by the rules everyone. Oh, we got a girl as a finalist tonight. We both like girls. Hey, who's the one in the corner, you, not paying attention to two beautiful women here for his pleasure? - Jim. Jim. Jim. Hey look at me. - Yeah. - We are going to give one lucky winner the show of a lifetime. We're going to do everything, and I mean everything. So keep watching. That one. He's our winner. Everyone else, so nice seeing you again. Better luck next time. - Okay guys, and Zoey. I'll be back on cam tomorrow night my normal time. And if you want a one on one, just message me. Bye! Stay right there Jerry, I'll be back in a minute. Jerry. - Hi, I guess I'm the winner, huh? - Jerry, Jerry, Jerry. You are in for a treat. I'm really glad that she chose you. Wanna know why I'm glad she chose you? Jerry? - Ahh, sorry. What were you saying? - Do you wanna know why I'm glad that she choose you? - Okay. - You're different. You're not like the other guys. You let me be myself, you don't rush me, you let me do what I wanna do, touch myself how I wanna touch myself. You don't make demands of me. I really enjoy my time with you. - I'm sorry, there's some, like, interference or something going on. - Uhhh, it's gone now. That was weird. - You want weird, you should hear what some of the other guys want. They can be really persistent about it. - Yeah, I bet. That Eric guy was kinda rude. - I can tell you're a good person. That's what makes me wanna know more about you. I'm curious to see what the rest of your place looks like. Give me a tour of Jerry's castle. - Yeah, Sindy will be back in a few minutes. I wanna see where I sent those care packages. - Well, I could switch over to my cell phone and do that I guess. - Perfect, let's see. Okay hold on. So that's, uh, my front door, where people come in and I go out. That's uh, that's my kitchen. I sometimes cook. Let's see your bedroom Jerry. Yeah, yeah, sure, we have to backtrack, so hold on. There's the living room, and we got to go down the hallway. There's the bathroom, sorry. And then, there's the bedroom. That's it, nothing special. Okay. Alright, that's it. Nothing special. - Very nice Jerry. Thanks for showing me around. - No problem. I didn't know I was gonna be giving a tour, though so excuse the mess. That's a very nice bachelor pad that you have all to yourself. You like me a lot Jerry, don't you? - Yeah. - Do you wanna do something for me that would, - Ummm, Sorry. It's a little kinky. Go get a big kitchen knife for me. I'll be waiting right here when you get back. - I have a pocket knife in my desk, is that okay? - Even better. - Okay, hold on. It's got to be here somewhere. Very good Jerry. - You know what would be really hot if you could do a little something for me. - Okay, what do you want me to do? - I have this fetish, if you could just take that knife and, cut your hand a little bit for me. - I don't know about that-- - Jerry, it would turn me and Sindy on so much. No guy has ever done this for me. I want you to be the first. - Okay I'll try. I'm sorry, I can't, it'll hurt. - Jerry baby, look at me. Put that knife on your hand and cut yourself for me, just a little bit. - Kinda liked doing that. - I do. I know of a way we can be together, for real. You would like that, wouldn't you? Me, you, and Sindy, the three of us to be together? - Of course. - You would do anything for me, wouldn't you? - I would. - I just need you to do one more thing for me, okay? - Okay. - I want you to take the knife and cut your throat open. - Jerry, we'll be together, forever, I promise. Do it for me. - I don't wanna do that! Why would you want me to cut my throat? - Baby, because you want me and I want you. You can do this. You know this is the only way. - No! - Please, we'll be together, I promise. - I don't feel well. - I know, I know. It'll be over before you know it. - No! No! I don't want to die. - Jerry! - Please don't make me do this. - Jerry, take that knife and slit your throat. Very good, do it for me baby, you're doing great. You were so close, baby, lets try again. Jerry, baby look at me. Jerry, look at me! You're doing great. Just do as I do okay, ready? - No! Please, don't make me. - So close. - I don't wanna die. - We'll be together soon. - I don't wanna -- - Do it for me. My lord, I know our great father two centuries ago forbid us to kill humans for consumption. And I know that he forbid us to rob their graves and mortuaries. But he said nothing of feasting on a human that has taken its own life in his own residence. I present to you this offering of untainted human flesh on the anniversary that you saved me from the Archangel Raphael. - My child, you please me so. It only took you 10 days to control your new host body. This is cause for celebration. In ancient times we would have a great feast for days. I have been trapped in this form for too long, my natural urgings stripped away from me. I have been hungry and unsatisfied all these years. You have done a great service to your lord. This pathetic creature was so easy to put into a trance, and give up his own free will. Come my child, join me. Partake for the first time in human flesh. Nicole. Nicole, wake up. Nicole, I need you to keep rolling the camera. - Okay. It's very important that we capture everything. - Oh my god, Jason! Jason! Jason, wake up. Are you okay? Jason wake up. Hold on, hold on, hold on man. I saw that thing with its tentacles down your throat. I thought you were dead! You saw it too, right? You saw it too? There's not a mark on you! - I don't have an answer for that. I think I know why we can't open the door, why the cell phones aren't working. Well go on Einstein, what's going on? - When our equipment malfunctioned, instead of the entity coming to our dilation, Oh my god. - We went to its dilation. Therefore everything we perceived, everything that's happened over the last several minutes is, just a fraction of the one second in the real world for us. - I only got a B in algebra, okay? So you two have fun discussing whatever you're gonna do, and I'm gonna break down that door. - Jason, stop it's not going to work! - Because we're in a bubble. There's a bubble that's centered somewhere on this bed, and it goes somewhere out here. It is continually expanding and contracting and we don't know where that line is. That's why when you go over there, you don't hear any sound. You bang on the door, there's no sound. When you walk, you don't hear your footsteps. - Okay, so. - Look. What do you see? - It's the feed outside, it must be frozen, the frame is frozen. - It's not frozen. That's the time dilation outside. That's where we came from. - Get me out of this place! No one can see or hear us? Can we reverse this time dilation? - Yeah, yeah, let's just do that, let's just reverse it, right, that's what we need to do. - Everything is, centered around the bed. If you go to the bed, I think that's okay. If I put in the right settings, it might work. - Yeah. No wait wait, hold on, the Spectre camera, hold on. - No! No, Jason, wait! Don't cross the line! - Uh, I'm stuck. - So sorry. Martin, why am I stuck? It's burning. - I don't -- - Nicole, I need you to listen to me. I just -- - Nicole. Nicole, Nicole stop. I need you to listen to me. You have to keep filming. When that thing put its tentacles in my head, I saw, I saw, everything that it saw. I could feel it, I could think everything that it was thinking. It's very scared and it's not scared of us, it's scared of something else that is out there. Every time we turn this thing on Nicole, every time we do, it sends a signal out into the universe. Some kind of beacon, some sign, and we don't know what's getting it. Anything could be getting that. Whatever is coming our way is far scarier than anything we're dealing with right now. It's very scared and it's not scared of us, it's scared of something else that is out there. It sends a signal out into the universe, some kind of beacon. Whatever is coming our way is far scarier than anything that we're dealing with right now. - My name is Amanda Cortney. I'm of sound mind and relatively good health. I've been, for lack of a better term, kidnapped. I remember. I remember flashes here and there. They do things that, I don't wanna talk about it. And trust me, if they did them to you, you wouldn't wanna talk about them either. The physical stuff, I can take. My mind, my emotions, my being, that, they can't have. But I realized something. And now I know, I can beat these mother fu-- - Welcome to our end of grad school blowout. My name's Ryan, and I'll be your host for tonight's festivities. Wanna give me the first testimonial, I'll show this to everyone years from now when we're all fat and old. - My testimonial Ryan, is that you should de-nerd yourself for your own party. There are a ton of hot girls here. - I have, excuse me dude, I have a testimonial as well. Ashley and I hooked up last week. - We did not. - Yes we did, yes we did. Dude, we hooked up alright, you loved it and you know it. Hey, what's up? I like this, party people having fun, what's up? - Oh no, no, I'm Josh, I'm Josh. - Josh, sorry man, I get you guys confused. Stop doing that, dude! You guys are disgusting. Funny face, you wanna give a testimonial? - Get the camera out of my face. - I'm serious. What's up? - I have something really serious things to talk to you about. What's up dude? - I'm just kidding, I don't have anything to say. And so, I don't now. If you're into practicing the same things, we can practice things together. - Sorry. You said Amanda never has more than one drink. Never, no. - So she's probably not the kind of girl who would be hooking up with two guys at the same time? - I think I just saw these two douche bags drag her into your room. Take this! Excuse me. Sorry. Watch Out. Hey! Open the door! Hey whoa, whoa! - Dude, you're like a bearded Rhonda Rousey. - Those roofie loving molester mother, yeah, she's totally crashed. - Dude, I don't know, I'm just thinking maybe you shouldn't start taping her as soon as she wakes up. - We need to get whatever she remembers on tape right away. She might press charges, those guys might press charges against us for beating them up, you don't know. Amanda, you okay? - The things they did to me. The things they did to me. Why would they do that? Why would they do that to me? Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! - That must've been at least a 6.0 quake. Amanda? - Guys, why don't you help me get her to Josh's bedroom. Ryan. One of the many large shards of glass I'm finding all over my house now, which is just really great. - You guys, I just looked it up to see how big that earthquake was, and there's no report of an earthquake. Nobody else felt it. - Power surge or something maybe? - A power surge wouldn't make the whole building shake. Look, look out here, everything's fine. - What is there to eat around here? You guys didn't eat everything, did you? Man, I passed out last night, I'm starving. What's the last thing you remember? - Ummmm, I was talking to some guy. I had the weirdest dreams last night. What? Am I missing something? How are you? - I'm alright. Sorry about the video call, my phone, it's all messed up. - No worries. How are your grandparents? - They're doing well. Um, you're the only person I could talk to about this, I'm sorry to bother you. - Don't be silly, glad you called. I was just thinking the other day, that this is the first time since we were 12 we've lived in different cities from each other. - Yeah, you were my, constant all those years. So, umm, I'm just gonna say it, I've seen my mom a few times. Did you call the police? - No, it's hard to explain, but, I can't call the police-- - Of course you can, you have to. What did you grandparents say? - I'm not telling my grandparents that I saw their daughter-in-law who went crazy and murdered their son. Besides, they wouldn't believe me. - You're not making any sense. You need to talk to someone. - I'm not sure she's entirely responsible for everything she did. I think it's passed onto me now. - Anyway, I'll figure something out, I'm sorry to bother you. - Don't hang up. - My grandparents are gonna be back soon. I thought it would stop when I came here, I'll talk to you later. - Amanda, wait a second. Good to see you're alive. - I'm in Montana. - Nearest home is a 30 minute drive. I thought that getting away from civilization would make it stop. It did for a bit, but, it's worse now. - Amanda, you can't just run away from this. You need to get help. - That's why I'm calling. If I come down there next week on the 10th, can I stay with you? - Of course, you know that. - Can Josh and Ashley be there too, I'm gonna need all three of you. - I'm sure they'll both be there if you need them. - All three of us are very worried, we were going to track you down and come to wherever you are. - And take me away like an intervention, kidnap me? - Something like that. - I should go before we lose the connection. - Wait a minute, please don't disappear again. - I promise, I'll be there soon. Really, already? Can't I just, finish my conversation? - Please, you do this all the time. Make sure the camera is always recording and most importantly-- - Yeah yeah yeah, don't fall asleep, we got it. - Right, okay. I'm gonna be in the bedroom, and I'll leave it open so you guys can check in on me if you want. Just record everything, and stay awake, please. Just drink coffee or do coke. - None of us do cocaine, you know that. Is this what's happening? - No no no no, I'm not, no. Just, guys please just do this for me. Okay, thank you. I'm gonna go to bed, alright. Good night. Thanks. - Dude, you gotta get a couch already. - I told you, I'm moving in two months for the job, what's the point. - Am I the only one that thinks it's weird that she wants to sleep in the same bed where it happened? - Maybe it's just her way of dealing with all this. - Yeah, she'll be fine. Everybody's different. Ashley, Ashley wake. Ryan, will you wake Ashley. Hey! Hey! Get up! Get the camera! - Amanda, Amanda. Everything is okay, we're here for you. - Well, that didn't work. Was I screaming again? - Yeah, Jesus, we thought you were dying or something. - I'm sorry, I thought I was past that part. You guys just dozed off or something? - I don't know, I just remember that we were laying there. - Don't worry about it, I didn't think it would work. It was worth a try. Just turn the camera off, just turn it off! - Okay, the camera is all set. But, I don't really understand why they can't see whatever you wanna show me. - Because the only person that I care about knowing that I'm not crazy is you. Not Ashley, not my grandparents. But for right now, this is just between you and me right now, okay? - Okay. You gonna show me card tricks? - Not exactly. I just needed something that was small and light. I'm still figuring this out. Just watch. - That's a good trick. How are you doing that? - It's not a trick. - Come on, tell me how. - I told you it's not a trick. - Alright, so you are saying you have telekinetic psychic powers, then? - If you wanna call them that. - You can move things with your mind? - Yeah. Ever? - Okay. So, this is still related to what happened to you at the party? Those two guys attacked you. You suppressed all memory of it, and somehow your brain has rewired itself to give you this ability? - No. I'm not gonna tell you what's been happening to me. Cause westernized medicine would just say that I'm suppressing traumatic memories of an event. - Just like I've been saying. - And I promise you that is not what's been happening to me. But it's real. And it was happening to my mom. - Oh, come on. - And I want it to stop more than anything. And I wanna be able to tell you what it is, but first I have to be able to prove to you what it is. Just like I was able to prove that I could move that card with my mind. - Just. You can stay here. I'll take care of you, we'll get you a good therapist, and you'll -- - I'm gonna go. - I'm gonna pack up and leave. - Don't be silly. - I need to go, so I can find a way to prove to you what's been happening to me. Don't worry, okay? I'll be fine. They're not as smart as they think they are. Amanda! - Hey. Well let's get to it. What's so important you needed to show me? - Play the video file in your inbox. I have three other angles, but this one should explain everything. What the hell is that thing? Can you come up here as soon as you can? Ryan! Can you come up and help me? - Yeah, yeah, of course. Okay I'll call you tomorrow. - Okay, talk to ya then. Dang, when'd you get this good? Could we just record it once, please? - I'm not your circus monkey. - You know we need it for the tape. - Alright. Just give me a second. - That's amazing! - I'm very happy. I can't believe you've been living in this place for two months with no electricity. Okay, it's on. Go ahead. - My name is Amanda Cortney. I'm of sound mind and relatively good health. For the past few months, I've been, for a lack of a better term, kidnapped. Taken against my will at night, over and over, by these entities. These beings. That are, well they're certainly not human, I could tell ya that much. Tell us how it usually happens. - Something wakes me up in my bed, late at night. But, I can't move. It's like I'm paralyzed. And then all the electronics, the phone, TV, clock, computer, anything that's on goes dead. So, there I am just laying in bed, awake. But paralyzed in this silence. This dead silence of nothingness. And then, the light comes. This bright, massive light fills the entire room. And I wanna scream, I wanna cry, I want them to leave me alone. But they don't. They never do. And then my body starts to slowly float above the bed. And they take me. They take me away. Where do they take you? - To a room in some, look, I know all of this sounds crazy, but I have proof. You definitely have proof. I'm a believer. That's why I'm here. - So they take me. These, well, there's three different types. Three species, I guess. And they do things to me. Experiments. They do things that, I don't wanna talk about it. And trust me if they did them to you, you wouldn't wanna talk about them either. I remember. I remember flashes here and there. And I don't think they know that I can remember. Cause they speak to me, inside my head. You'll be okay, you won't remember any of this. But I do remember. The physical stuff, I can take. As messed up as that is. But my mind, my memories, my emotions, my being, that they can't have. What have you done to try and stop them? - Everything. Anything you could think of. I moved out into the middle of nowhere. I stayed at people's houses. I tried to get a friend to stay up all night with me once. I've tried to get three friends to stay up all night with me. I was one of those three. That was a crazy night. - It didn't work. They took me anyway. I found this crazy guy online, and I rented out his underground bunker. That was stupid. I nailed the door shut, I nailed the window shut. I tied myself to the bed. Doesn't work. I tried to record them taking me. I used a hidden camera, a hidden spy camera, a hidden infrared spy camera. Nothing. Just all comes out garbled static. I hooked up a hair trigger shotgun, three times. I woke up the next morning, each time, to a bent shotgun. But I realized something. They can recognize threats like the gun and neutralize them. They can mess with anything electronic. They can play with our minds and memories because our brains function via electrical impulses. But there are ways to record things without any electronics, any batteries, no electricity. Over here, these are eight millimeter 1950s film cameras. They run on wind up springs, and shoot on film. All chemical. No electronics, no batteries, no electricity. Over here, this is a fully functional 1920s replica Victor talking machine record player that can also record sound onto a wax record. No batteries, no electricity, thank you very much. And what did you do with these two ancient relics of technology? - I set them in my room a few weeks ago, and I recorded them taking me. And now I know I can beat these mother fuckers. I had the four eight millimeter cameras and Victor phones set up on a kind of reverse electrical switch. Now I'm recording film and sound entirely free of electricity. Obviously they create some vortex or field or something that no one sees what's going on. I'll make sure the cameras are strapped down better this time. It won't be so easy for them next time. The film's impressive. - I'm gonna have the four eight millimeter cameras set up all over the room. As well as the Victor talking machine. And I have water balloons, but they're not filled with water. They're filled with sulfuric acid. And I have a trip catapult wire, ready to set off on anything that walks through that door. And if that doesn't work, next stop is a U.S. Army directional land mine. First thing's first. - My name is Amanda Cortney. I'm 24 years old, and I'm a multiple abductee. But I won't be anymore. I'll be recording all night. - Until they mess up your camera, and they will. Need anything else? - I'm good. I'm ready. Thank you, Ryan. Good night. Night. - Hey. Still no sign from them at all? - Been over a month. Nothing. - That's good. Well, I need to crash. Have to fly out for work tomorrow. - Ryan. I wish you were here. Next to me. I think it's time we consummate this relationship. - You want me to leave the chat and camera out again while you sleep? I know it's silly. - Of course. I'll come out in the next couple weekends, and we'll consummate. - Over and over. Good night, Amanda. - Good night, Ryan. - Nicole. When we turn the machine on, it created a, semi-permanent time dilation bubble that expands, we know this, yes it expands. Simultaneously, it created the bubble that shrinks. Meaning we can be in two different time dilations. The semi-permanent one, That's the one that keeps expanding every time we turn it on we get to go out there, and that's what lets us interact with these things, okay. Nicole we can go out there, and we can touch the seats, we can touch the light. That line, that line right now, is somewhere in the middle of this theater, but we don't know where it is. Here, right here, right here. Where is it? When I did my calculations right here. Because it's coming in so much, we can only run this thing one more time, Nicole. We got one more shot at this. That's what cut Jason in half. He was in two dilations at one time, and that's why he got cut in half. We only have time to power up maybe one more time, before it gets too small. Anytime after that, it's gonna shrink so much we're not gonna fit inside, and then we're gonna end up just like him, or worse. We can be in an infinite number of time dilations right now. Multiple time dilations. I don't know, we can be in an infinite number of time dilations. - Get down! What was that? Did you hear it? Set the pulse rate to nine, Nicole. Then we'll power all the way to 10. Okay. Wait, wait, how are you gonna keep it there? - I'm gonna be in there with it. No Martin, you'll die. - I'm already dead, Nicole. What? - You saw what that thing did to me. You know that I'm dead. No. I can't. - Hey, hey. You won't believe what just happened. I need you to. Hello? No, can you hear me? No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hello! - Okay, I gotta go, bye. - I don't know, it wasn't there before. - Weird. You used to believe in us. In your myths, your legends, your religions. Your ignorance gives us strength. We influence many into chaos. We hide in the open. We rarely show our true form. We have many other enemies. You're getting close to the truth. To us. We won't let that happen.
