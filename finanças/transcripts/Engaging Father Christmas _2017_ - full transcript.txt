Talk to me about anything. The only thing that she didn't talk to me about was my father, but my whole life, I've wondered who he was, and now I feel like I finally have a clue. I have to do something. [Katherine]: You come all the way across the country the week before Christmas, to a place you've never been before, to find something... I have a feeling it must be very important. You work at the inn? - Yeah. - I just checked in. It's really nice. Miranda. Ian. [Grunts] Nice to meet you. [Miranda]: I used to walk down the street and wonder, "Is that him? Is that my father? Is that him?" I think maybe this was a mistake. What do you mean? Coming here. I don't think I'm gonna find the answers I'm looking for. I'm not sure what brought you here, Miranda, but I'm glad it did. You think it's possible every Christmas could be like this? Possible? I'm counting on it. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Merry Christmas! [♪♪♪] [sighing] I got this. [bells ringing] I have everything ordered for Mr. Burnett. All of the furniture requisitions are in, and should be ready by the time they get back after the holidays. Oh! And we finally settled on the Southwest motif. It's going to look great. But give Kevin in the warehouse a heads-up... "watch out for the cactus." Okay. "Ouch, cactus." Got it! All right. I think that is everything. Except this. Annie... This is for you. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Miranda! Thank you. But, please. Don't open until Christmas. Oh, listen to you. I can't even believe this is the same person. A year ago, you were this close to "Bah, Humbug!" Okay. Well, a year ago, I hadn't been to Carlton Heath, and I hadn't discovered the real meaning of Christmas. I think it's wonderful. And you're heading back again this year to spend Christmas with Ian and his family? It's like you'll be home for the holidays. Annie, you have no idea. Speaking of Ian... He hasn't... dropped any hints about what he's getting you for Christmas? Nope. Not jewelry... a little something-something that fits on your finger? Yeah, no. That's not... We're, um... we haven't even actually... Listen to you! You sound as excited as a kid waiting for Santa! I do not. Now, we still have work to do before I go. You know, a proposal at Christmas... doesn't get much more romantic than that. Yeah. [♪♪♪] Merry Christmas, Mom. [Katherine]: Welcome to the Carlton Heath Inn. As I said, my name's Katherine. My husband, Andrew and I, we own the inn, so if you need anything, just say the word. And your room's at the top of the stairs on the left. Okay. You're all set. I salted down the front steps and piled plenty of extra wood in the stack. That should hold you till I get back from the airport. You didn't have to do that. Ah, it's all right. Physical labor kind of helps me think. Yes, you must have a lot on your mind, with Miranda coming back. Have you made any special plans for what you're gonna do when she's here? No, she just wants to see everyone again, and do all the things she remembers from last year. And you never know, if all goes well... she just might not want to leave this time. [chuckles] Okay. That's enough. Uh... I'm... I'm just looking forward to seeing again how happy the two of you are when you're together for Christmas. That doesn't come along every day. Believe me, I know. Ah, I should get going. I've got some errands to run, and I still have to change before I head to the airport. Do you mind if I take your car instead of my truck? No. Go, go. Don't keep her waiting. [♪♪♪] Hi. I just got your texts. How long do you think you'll be? Oh, the freeway feels like a parking lot right now. Probably at least another 30 minutes or so. Well... it's only probably been, what? Seven weeks and three days since I last saw you in Seattle? What's another 30 minutes? Only the longest 30 minutes of my life. [laughs] Sweet talker. I'll just grab a coffee or something. And when I get there, I'll be the one jumping up and down like a kid on Christmas morning. [laughing] Miranda Chester? Josh? I can't believe this. No kidding. May I? Yeah, sure. Uh, it's got to have been, what? Two years? Just about. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's right. It was just after Christmas, year before last. We decided we should, uh... "Take a break"? It was all very civilized, as I recall. Uh, what are you doing in Boston? I'm actually meeting some friends. We're going skiing in the Berkshires. Better question. What are you doing here? You're a long way from home. I am spending Christmas in Vermont, a small town called Carlton Heath. Huh! As I recall, you weren't a big fan of celebrating Christmas. [laughs] Right. Well, a lot has changed in the past two years, Josh. Hey. Do you remember when we were dating, I told you that I never knew my father? Yeah, of course. You said your mother never told you. So, last Christmas, I found this photo in my mother's things, from a long time ago, and it was taken in Carlton Heath. There was something about it. So... I went looking for my father. What happened? The man in the photo was him. You found your father? Uh-huh. That is amazing, Miranda! How did it go? Did you get to meet him? Oh, no, he... He passed away a few years ago. Oh! I'm so sorry, Miranda. Thanks. It's okay. Um... Josh, I really want to tell you something, but you have to promise me you won't tell anyone. Yeah, yeah. You know me. You can... you can trust me. Okay. My father was James Whitcomb. Wait... James Whitcomb? - Like, the actor? - Mm-hmm. You mean the one with all the awards and everything, he's your father? James Whitcomb? Shh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but... Seriously? Mm-hmm. Yeah, so now you get it. Now you know why you can't say anything, because his fam... Well, my family, they trust me not to tell the secret. I told you, Miranda. Your secret is safe with me. Thank you. [thump] Pardon me. I'm so sorry. So sorry. Pardon me. It's so crowded in here, it's hard to get around. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Wow! I know. [alert rings] Ooh. There are my friends. I should get going. Oh. Right. Me too. Yeah. It was great seeing you. - You too! - Yeah. Josh, what I said, if we could just definitely keep it between us... It's me, remember? You don't have to worry. Everything you said stays between us, I promise. [Miranda]: Thank you. [Josh]: Okay. Merry Christmas. Oh! Merry Christmas. [sighing] So that's how it is, hmm? I'm a half hour late, and you start kissing strangers in the airport? Ian! Now I know it's really Christmas. [chuckling] [Ian]: Is there anything else I should know about this old boyfriend? [Miranda]: No. Josh is ancient history. [Ian]: Good. When you gave me this, you said it was my very own Christmas angel, to help guide me home. And here you are. Guess it worked. Speaking of Christmasy stuff... there is one thing we should probably talk about. What's that? I'm really gonna need your help again with my lines for the play. [laughing] [dramatic male voice]: "Come in and know me better, man." Okay, I never did it like that. You did! No, I did not. [British accent]: "Come in and know me better, man." Okay, we're getting there. That's closer. - [laughing] I know! - That is closer. It is. [♪♪♪] [doorbell chimes] Miranda, you're here! Hi, Julia! Oh, it's so good to see you. - I missed you! - I missed you too. Hi there, handsome. Hi, Miranda. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. We're so happy you're staying with us this year. Oh, me too. Aw. Hey, Ian. Hi. Here, let me get your bags for you. Oh, boy, are you sure? Okay, let me help him. It's heavy. Sorry. Oh! Look how beautiful that tree looks. I had to get that in. I need to run to the theater. Why don't you stop by after you finish settling in? Terrific. See you soon. [♪♪♪] [phone ringing] [♪♪♪] [door creaks] Hello, Miranda. Margaret! Hi. It's so good to see you. How are you? I'm very well, thank you. And you? How is life in Seattle? Great, yeah. So... here we are again. Christmas. Here we are. You're waiting for Ian? Mm-hmm. He's just backstage or something. Yeah, he's talking to Peter. They had something to sort out. I'm... I'm sure it won't take long. Miranda, I-I just, uh... I want to thank you for your discretion this past year. When you found out the truth last Christmas about James and your mother... I... Well, I frankly didn't know what to expect. What did you think I was gonna do? There are people in this world who would've used our secret to their advantage, and James was a very private person, and I feel it's my responsibility to see that we aren't fodder for the tabloids. That's not why I came here. I came to find out who my father was. I'd never do anything to hurt the family, or hurt his reputation. And I know that now. I am grateful that you never told anyone, that you kept it in the family. I'm very sorry that I doubted you. Thank you. So let's go and see what's keeping those two. Mm-hmm! [♪♪♪] [text alert chimes] [chimes] [snow crunching under tires] [Miranda]: Look. [Ian]: And that's all it said? "The Ghost of Christmas Past"? Mm-hmm. I tried texting back, but nobody responded. Did you try to find the number? Yeah, it's blocked. There's no way to find out. Have you seen it before? No, but James Whitcomb was a famous actor. There's all kinds of pictures of him on the Internet. Yeah, but this was clearly taken at Christmas, which means it must have been taken here. Have you talked to Peter and Ellie? No. Why? Because it doesn't sound like something that Margaret would do. What are you talking about? Miranda, the only people who know that James Whitcomb is your father are my folks and the Whitcomb family. No one else has any reason to send this picture to you. So you think it was one of them? Come on! "The Ghost of Christmas Past"? It's right out of the show. Yeah, but why all the mystery? I don't know! It's kind of fun. Didn't you ever draw names for "Secret Santa" presents at work? Okay, so you think someone drew my name out of a hat for this? You know, what I think is it's a great picture. And wherever it came from, you're gonna enjoy it for a long time. Yeah. Yeah. Here they are, Andrew! Did I happen to mention how much my folks were looking forward to seeing you again? Well, now, aren't you a sight for sore eyes? [Katherine]: Merry Christmas, sweetie! Merry Christmas. You have no idea how this poor boy has been pining away for you. Dad, seriously? But don't tell him I told you. I won't. Well, come on, let's get you guys inside. I have fresh scones in the oven. [Miranda]: Are you sure there isn't anything I can to do help? No. You just relax and drink your tea. Ohh! Those scones smell amazing. Well, they'll be gone before too long, so grab a plate while you still can. I've got fresh jam in the fridge. So... how are things in Seattle? Thank you. Um... good. Yeah. I mean, I love my job, and we've been busy, so... that's good. You're happy there? As happy as I can be 3,000 miles away from Ian. Mm. What I look forward to most about Christmas is how it brings together all the people we love, the ones we never get to spend enough time with. There's something so special about that. And you never know. Some wonderful things can happen. I have never looked forward to Christmas this much in my life. [♪♪♪] They're decorating! Should we help them? It'll be fun. I want to show you something. What is it? I just need your opinion. About what? You'll see. You're doing this on purpose. [♪♪♪] Oh, Ian... This is beautiful. It's probably my favorite place in town. You want to take a look inside? Can we? Oh, Ian. This is beautiful. It's a work in progress. Look at these moldings. Mm-hmm. Incredible! [Ian]: It's called the Rose Cottage. [Miranda]: How did you find this? Oh, Ian. This isn't yours, is it? No! No. I'm just... I'm just working on it. The cottage belongs to Margaret. Really? I don't remember the family saying anything about this place. It's been empty for quite some time. She hired me a few weeks ago to fix it up. Why? I don't know. She said she's not sure what she's gonna do with it. Well, what do you think about it? Are you kidding me? I think that when you're finished with the renovations, it's going to be perfect. Yeah. Yeah, that's, uh, kind of what I think too. Can I check out the kitchen? Mm-hmm. Uh, Miranda... Hmm? Um... Uh...? Hi. Hi! ♪ Knock-knock! ♪ [giggles] Hi! Hi! - What are you doing? - Nothing. How are you two this morning? How did you know we would be here? Oh, well, we stopped by the inn to find you, and Katherine said you two might be over here. And here we are. - Hi, Ian! - Hi! So the kids and I are going Christmas shopping today, and we would love for you to join us. Please, Miranda? Come with us. And then we'll have hot chocolate at the inn. With a candy cane to stir with! True. Well, that sounds fun. You should go. There's so many things I could do here. There's lots. Are you sure? - Yeah. - Such a sweetheart. Wasn't there something you wanted my opinion about? [♪♪♪] Uh... Oh. Um, yeah. Yeah, it was, uh... I wanted to... get your opinion on the colors. Given your specialty with interior design and all. Okay, well, I'd be happy to help. I'll, um... I'll see you at the inn later? Yeah. Yeah, at the inn. Okay. Oh! No, uh, wait. Not the inn. I... I'll be at the theater. Uh, rehearsing. For our show. You okay? I'm so okay. Great. I'll see you later. - Okay, let's go! - Bye! Bye, guys. Bye. [sighing] - Auntie Ruth? - Yes. And Auntie Felicia? Yes. And don't forget... And Dad! And Dad! Mom! What about that for Dad? [gasps] Let's have a look. Does he like ducks? - Thank you! - Merry Christmas. [laughter] Good work, guys! [Miranda sighs] - That's a lot of presents. - I'm coming! [bells jingling] Merry Christmas. [jingling] [Ellie]: There are so many pictures of James, it's hard to keep them all straight. I just thought since he was dressed for Christmas, it might have been taken at your house. You should ask Peter or Margaret. They might be able to recognize it. I'll do that. Where did you find it? Uh... it was on the Internet. Hey. It's okay to ask, Miranda. He was your father too. I don't know about you guys, but I could really go for some hot chocolate right now. Yeah! Yeah! I think it's unanimous. [cell ringing] Sorry. Sorry, sorry. This is my office. I should see what's up. I'll be in in a minute. We'll save you a seat. Okay. Hey, Annie. What's going on? Hey, Miranda! I'm so sorry to bother you. I just wasn't sure if this might be important. - What is it? - I'm not sure, exactly. This guy keeps calling. Wants to talk to you. What guy? I don't know. He won't leave his name or number. I finally told him that you were out of town for the holidays, you know, so he would stop calling. Well, he sounds like he's just a salesman or something. See, that's what I thought, but when I told him you were gone, he started asking these questions. What kind of questions, Annie? About you... and your family. Um... So what did you say? Nothing. I mean, that's nobody's business. But the strange thing is, he kept asking about your father. Didn't you tell me you never met your Dad? Yeah. Um... so he's obviously someone who doesn't know me. You can just ignore it. Okay. Just wanted to make sure. Thanks, Annie. Um... I'll talk to you soon? Okay. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Here you go! - [gasping] Yay! - Wow! - Enjoy! - Thank you. Oh! One more hot chocolate comin' up! Yes, please. Ooh. That looks so yummy! Delish. Miranda? Josh? Hey. Josh, what are you doing here? I know, it's kinda crazy, right? Uh, do you want to sit for a second? - Sure. - Okay. Thanks. Um, I thought you were going skiing? Yeah, I was. I was. Uh, but then I ran into you at the airport. Well, you told me about this little town, and how you flew across the country for the holidays... and I kinda got curious. About what? Well, about... About you. About Carlton Heath, about, you know, what it must have been like to find your father. - Josh... - Oh! I'm so sorry. I just realized this might be a little bit weird for you. It's a small town. Yeah! I stopped to get gas on the way here, I asked the kid where the locals go to eat, and they told me about this place. Lo and behold, here you are. [Josh laughs] Practically a local. I really like it here. The people have been very nice to me. That's great. I mean that, seriously. It's a great little town. Kind of has that feeling of what Christmas really should feel like. Yeah. I got to be honest with you. This town, as lovely as it is... ...is not the only reason that I drove all the way up here. Oh? I wanted to see you. To ask you if... if you were seeing anybody else. [sighing] Um... Yes, I am. It's serious? - Very. - [he laughs] Well, uh, you know what? I kind of figured. You look so amazing. Thank you. That's... A guy can always hope, right? It was really good to see you again. Yeah! Yeah. Yeah. So Merry Christmas. Thanks. And take care. Um, hey, there is, um... there's one other thing. I'll walk you out. Okay. Sure. [Miranda]: Be right back. Hey, I just want to let you know, I understand how awkward this is, all those eyes in there, watching us. What did you want to tell me? Right. Um... Okay, well, you remember Danny, my brother, the lawyer? Yeah, of course you do. Well, if you ever need any help with representation... What do you mean? Uh, well, I know that everything's all flowers and roses right now, but I'm sure James left you a pretty decent estate, and when it comes to getting your inheritance... What? Uh, all I'm saying is that if you want help... Okay. Um... Josh, I'm not here for money. No... I came to Carlton Heath to find my father, and I would never do anything to jeopardize my relationship with my new family. Looks like your shopping expedition was a success. Hello, Ian. Oh, no... you've lost Miranda. No, silly. She's outside talking to her friend. Oh, is that right? Her hot chocolate's getting cold. Maybe I should let her know. [♪♪♪] Miranda, Miranda... I'm just trying to help. Did you tell your brother about my father? What? No. No! No, you asked me not to tell anybody, and I didn't. Okay, because, um... you're the only one I told. Outside of the family, you're the only one who knows James Whitcomb is my father. I promised you that I wouldn't tell anybody. And I meant it. Okay. Thanks. Here. It's got my cell and my e-mail. If you ever need to talk... About anything. [♪♪♪] Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Ian, theatrically]: "The hour struck, and Scrooge found himself face to face with the Spirit that was foretold." "...And Scrooge found himself face to face with the Spirit that was foretold." Miranda! Hi! Ellie told me you were back. I'm sorry I've been so busy. Welcome. Thanks. It's really good to see you again, Peter. Miranda, this is Natalie Garrett. Natalie, this is Miranda Chester. Hi. Nice to meet you. You too. Natalie is up from the city for a few days, doing research on a magazine article. Really? What kind of article? Actually, it's about Peter's father, James Whitcomb. Oh. With the 30th anniversary of Dad saving the theater, and their first production of A Christmas Carol, I thought the holidays would be a perfect time for Natalie to visit. She can watch the play, and talk to Mother and the rest of the family about Dad. Did you know James? Never got to meet him. Miranda lives in Seattle. She's visiting for the holidays. She's a friend of the family. Well, he was a fascinating man, more than just a great actor. He did so much for the community. I've heard really wonderful things, and I look forward to reading your article. Thank you. Oh, let me show you the theater. Okay, yeah. Excuse me. It's great to see you. You too. Yeah. [Ian]: Well, what do you know? My Christmas wish came true. A beautiful young woman waiting for me at Christmas. Thank you, Santa! Ahh. Aren't you supposed to be annoyed with me? And why's that? Because the guy I said was ancient history suddenly showed up again. Oh... that. [sighs] I didn't know he was gonna do that. Honestly, Ian, before I ran into Josh at the airport, I hadn't spoken to him in a couple of years. Oh, I had a feeling he'd show up. You did? I saw him at the airport... that look on his face? I mean, there you are, looking fantastic, as always. He can see what he's missed out on. He'd be crazy if he didn't give it a shot. [deep sigh] So, oh, yeah. I definitely saw it coming. Well, I heard you were at the inn, and you didn't say hello or goodbye, so, I, uh, I just thought you were probably upset with me. I had rehearsal. Besides... I knew he never had a chance. Of course, I was prepared to challenge him to a duel if he persisted. [laughing] But, fortunately, for him, it didn't come to that. Fortunately. [giggles] You better get used to it. I love you... and nothing is ever gonna change that. I love you too. [♪♪♪] You're freezing. I know! I guess I kind of forgot it can get pretty cold here. And that's something you don't want to forget. Let's get you home. [♪♪♪] What are you doing? You'll see. Why are we here? You're just full of surprises. Wait for it. I'm waiting.

Would you mind if I asked first? Sorry. Sorry. [neighs] Miranda... I've been thinking about this for a long time... About finding the right words to tell you how I feel, about making sure you know how much you mean to me, and it always comes down to this one thing, and it's the only thing that matters... I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Miranda... [sighs] Will you marry me? Yes! Of course I will. It's so beautiful. [♪♪♪] [Andrew]: Ahem. Uh, everyone? If I could have your attention for a moment, please? I'd like to propose a toast. To Miranda and Ian on their engagement. I couldn't be happier for you two. The only thing I really want to say is... What took you so long? [laughter] To Miranda and Ian. - Miranda and Ian. - Cheers! [glasses clinking] Congratulations. [both]: Thank you. I'm so happy for you, Miranda. So, you set a date yet? Uh... no, we haven't really gotten that far. Well, when you do, you let me know. I'd really like to help in any way that I can. Thank you. Uh, Peter tells me that you met Ms. Garrett. So, what did you think? [♪♪♪] I just... I really just said hi. He sent over some of her work for me to review, and she's really very good. Smart, and, uh, quite tenacious. Well, I'm sure there will be a lot of people who will be very interested to learn more about... about James Whitcomb. It's hard for you, isn't it? Not being able to call him your father? Look, Margaret, um... Peter made it very clear where I stand, as far as the whole article goes, and I would never... You don't have to worry. [chuckles] I-I don't. It's just that... when I look at you, it just reminds me so much of him that I wonder what he would say, what he would do. Margaret... Miranda! Mommy says I'm supposed to ask you. [laughs] Ask me what, sweetie? Is it okay, can I be a flower girl at your wedding? Please! Are you kidding me? [laughter] Of course you can! [giggles] Thank you! [adults laughing] What'd I miss? I'm going to be a flower girl! Oh, well, it's official, then. We are definitely getting married. Yay!

That's very funny. "Scrooge saw there sat upon his couch a jolly giant in a green robe, who bore a glowing torch." [wistful sigh] It's your line, ghost.

And every year after that. [sighing] Until we wear out our rocking chairs. [chuckles] And speaking of Christmas trees... Mm-hmm? The Christmas tree lighting is very soon. I know. And a certain jolly elf will be making his annual appearance. Of course. But this year, underneath that white beard and red suit will be a... how do I put this? ...A new man. Really? But what would Santa be without his Mrs. Claus to hand out candy canes to all the children? Does she get to ride in the sleigh with him? It's the only way to fly.

I was wondering if you've gotten any more calls? You know, from that guy who was asking about my family? No. Guess he finally took "no" for an answer. So he didn't leave his name or number? I asked, but no. Did he happen to say where he was calling from? No, but I thought you said he was just some salesman? Yeah, I've just...

I hope you don't mind. I just really like it here. Yeah, this is my favorite room too. Hi, Natalie. Morning. Well, this is great. I haven't seen most of these pictures before. Yeah, these are family photos from whenever James wasn't off doing a movie or a play. "James Whitcomb"? Did he write this? Uh, my husband was also a poet, yeah. That's one that I'm particularly fond of. Well, I had no idea he wrote poetry. Maybe I can include it in the article. Uh, Ms. Garrett is here this morning to interview me for her story. Oh, I should let you get to it, then. Uh, Miranda! I didn't get a chance to congratulate you on your engagement. I think it's great. Thank you. How did you and Ian meet? This is a long way from Seattle. Mm-hmm. Um... I was visiting last Christmas, and I stayed at his parents' inn, and... we hit it off, I guess. Peter said that you were a friend of the family, so was that why you were here, to spend Christmas with the Whitcombs? Well, Miranda spent last Christmas with us, and we had a lovely time. But I think that you'll find that Carlton Heath is a very small town, Ms. Garrett. Everyone here really is more like extended family, which is why James always made a point of being here for the holidays, because this was home. [♪♪♪] I stopped by the hardware store on my way over, ordered that paint you suggested. Jerry had to look it up three times. "Never heard of that before. Huh! 'Sunnyside Yellow'." It's gonna look great in here, though. Especially with that afternoon sun coming through. Yeah. You know, if you've got other stuff to take care of, like, shopping for my Christmas present, I can handle this. I like doing this with you. Yeah, I'm just not used to you being so... quiet. Sorry. I just have a lot on my mind, a lot of decisions to make. We have to pick a date, we have to pick a place for the ceremony. Oh... Well... how about right here? - Ian. - Right now? I'm being serious with you. I am too. We've already made the most important decision. Everything else is a piece of cake. Mm. I have to tell you something. I think I made a mistake, and I don't know how to fix it. What do you mean? I got another text message, with another picture, signed the same way... but this one's different. Well, that's you. At the airport, when I was waiting for you. Wait, someone else knows that James Whitcomb is your father? That's the only explanation. But how? And why would they send you a picture of yourself from the airport? Because I think that's where I made the mistake. I don't understand. I kept my promise to the Whitcombs. I didn't tell anyone that James was my father. I knew the kind of trouble it could cause them if anyone found out. But then I ran into Josh at the airport, and... I told him when we were together that I didn't know who my father was, and he was very understanding, very supportive. I trusted him. And you told him about James? I wasn't planning on it, but he's a psychologist. I mean, keeping things private, that's what he does. Well, obviously not in this situation. That's what I thought... when he showed up at the inn, and I got that message, but... it doesn't make sense. Miranda... he came all this way. Maybe he's not ready to give up. That's not what I mean. Look. That's Josh, right there, with me. Well, if he's in that photo, there's no way he could've taken that picture. Which means someone else did. Someone else sent that to me. But who? I don't know. The airport was really crowded. There were a lot of people there. It could've been anyone. But now... whatever happens with the Whitcombs, it's my fault. Hey! Hey. It's okay. They trusted me, Ian. They'll understand. And we'll figure this out together. How? [sighs] Do you have Josh's number? He gave me his card. Okay. Call him. Ask him. Maybe he saw something, or he saw somebody. [phone ringing] "Unknown Caller." [ringing continues] [beep] Hello. It's Miranda. Hi, Miranda. It's Natalie Garrett. Listen, I was wondering if you might have some time to talk while I'm in town. Thank you for meeting me, Miranda. I promise I won't keep you away from the festivities for too long. Oh, it's fine. I'm just... I'm not really clear why you wanted to meet with me. Here's the thing... When I pitched this story to my editor, it was all about the legacy of James Whitcomb and the 30th anniversary of the theatre. And getting to see his production of A Christmas Carol that he started so many years ago. Of course, yes. But now that I'm here... [sighs] I'm not sure that's the real story. What do you mean? Don't get me wrong. The family has been very forthcoming about James and life with the world-famous actor. It's just that... I get the feeling that they're leaving something out. Like what? I don't know. It's just a feeling. But I've been doing this long enough, I've learned to trust my feelings. I'm just not sure what you're asking me. I was thinking... maybe, as a friend of the Whitcombs, you could tell me about them. What they're really like. Oh. Uh... Well, they're wonderful people, and... I care about them a great deal. But... what am I missing? [church bells tolling] Do you hear that? The church bells? That's what you're missing. I'm not sure I follow. James Whitcomb loved Christmas. That's why he always made sure he was home for the holidays. He loved to be home for the snow and the lights, and the church bells... He loved the way it made him feel to be home with his family on Christmas morning. He was a great actor, yeah. But that love of Christmas... that was his real legacy. That's what he left his family. They're so beautiful. You seem to know an awful lot about a man you never met. Let me ask you a question. Your call came up on my phone as "unknown caller." Yeah, I do that for work. How many times did you call me to ask about meeting before I answered? Just once. When we spoke. You never called me before then? I would've left a voicemail. Why? I've just been getting some unknown calls, so I was curious. Okay, well, if you have a little more time, I do have a couple more questions. [♪♪♪] [theatrically, British accent]: "The hour struck, and Scrooge found himself face to face with the Spirit that was foretold." [louder]: "...And Scrooge found himself face to face with the Spirit that was foretold." [whispers]: Julia? Julia! I'm stuck! [laughter] It's okay. Here we go. Good? Okay, everybody. Um, let's take a quick break. We'll get back to this. Good work, everyone. Good work. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [log splits] [sighs] [grunts] Hey. "Hey" yourself. [planting ax in log] Brought you some cider. Ohh. Thank you. You're welcome. I was gonna say "to warm you up," but you're already on top of that. [he chuckles] Yeah. Really gets everything circulating. Natalie Garrett didn't send you those pictures, did she? No. Well, whoever did, you'll be hearing from them again. What do I do, Ian? I don't want to spoil anyone's Christmas. We're not gonna let it. [♪♪♪] Got it? Yes. Best tree ever! Let's go! Okay. Ooh! [engine starts] Ho ho ho! Ho ho ho. [they laugh] [brake engages, engine stops] [♪♪♪] [sighing] [click] [Miranda]: I love it. [♪♪♪] What's that? I don't know. It looks like there's something under the wallpaper. Hmm. [♪♪♪] [spritzing] [spritzing] [paper tears] Ian... [♪♪♪] [background music playing indistinctly] Good morning, Mr. Decker. I hope you slept well. Mm. Very well, thank you. You know, you have a beautiful inn. All these Christmas decorations! It's like something Charles Dickens would write about. Oh, thank you. And where did you get these scones? They are amazing. Oh, I make them fresh, right here. Well, you take it from me... They're a Christmas miracle. [laughs] Well, thank you again. So, what brings you to our small town? Well, actually, I'm on my way to spending the holidays with some friends, and, uh, I thought I'd just take the scenic route and enjoy some of our beautiful New England countryside at Christmas. Mm. There is nothing quite like it. Hadn't really planned on stopping, but when I drove into town... I don't know. The name was so familiar. Oh? Say, isn't Carlton Heath where James Whitcomb lived? That's right. I knew it sounded familiar. Does he still have family that live here? Oh, they're good friends of ours. As a matter of fact, you picked just the right time to visit. Why's that? Every year, the town puts on a performance of A Christmas Carol. It's kind of a tribute to James. Tonight, the show goes up. The family will be there. You should stay and see it. Hmm. Maybe I'll do that. [♪♪♪] All right. I've got the second coat on in the kitchen. I can get started in here next. Shouldn't you be getting ready for the theater soon? Good point. Can't keep your adoring fans waiting. [chuckles] [Ian]: Maybe it's from a poem or something. I don't recognize it. Neither do I. "Truth and grace." I like that. Me too. Why would anyone ever cover it up? Well, you should ask Margaret. This was her first home with your father. Really? Mm-hmm. She told me that they spent their early Christmases here together. Hmm. It's just the right kind of place to start a life together. I'm going to go get cleaned up. We'll get going. Ian... someone put this here for a reason. I don't think we should cover it up again. You're right. [♪♪♪] [excited chatter] Peter, I'm sorry I was late. Right here, Mother. It's so nice to see you. Hi. [chuckling]: You're all set. Yes, I am. Hmm. Mm-mm. [laughing] Break a leg. Thank you. - [door creaking] - Thank you. Hi! Hi! Hello. Hello. Here we go! [crowd hushes] [♪♪♪] [applause] [gruff, British accent]: What else can I be when I live in such a world of fools as this? "Merry Christmas." Hah! Out with "Merry Christmas." Bah, humbug. [audience laughing] [♪♪♪] Why, spirit, I know that boy. That is me, an... And this is my old schoolhouse. I would know this place anywhere. [bitterly]: Who needs Christmas? [♪♪♪] The hour struck, and Scrooge found himself face to face with the Spirit that was foretold. [eerily]: The second of the three spirits! Three spirits sent to haunt me, and one... Yes. ...To upstage me. [hearty laughter] [♪♪♪] Not yet! Don't leave me! Tell me what I must do! What of the other spirits? [applauding and cheering] [applause continues] Woo-hoo! [mouthing words as applause continues] [mouths words] Bravo! Woo-hoo! You're Peter Whitcomb. I am. Hi. I was a big fan of your father's. Really admired his work. Thank you. Great show, too. Beautiful way to remember him, having the whole town come together. It means a lot to everyone. It must really be special for you this year, I mean, having the family together for the first time. Excuse me? I-I'm curious. What was it like, after all those years, to find out that you have a sister? Couldn't have been easy. Who are you? Oh, yeah. Sorry. Steve Decker. I'm a writer. I'm working on a story about your father. I'm staying at the inn. I was really hoping you might have a few minutes to talk. I have nothing to say to you. Excuse me. [♪♪♪] Excuse me. Miranda, could I talk to you in the study? Mm-hmm. You must be starving. I am. Yep. I'm going to get you some food. Okay. Having fun? It makes me so happy. I don't know any Steve Decker. He seems to know who you are, that you're James Whitcomb's daughter. Well, how did he find that out? I was hoping you'd tell us. How can I, Peter? I've never even met the man. You're telling us that you never told anyone about James and your mother? No, but... [frustrated sigh] I trust Josh. Excuse me? Who's Josh? Josh is my ex-boyfriend. I hadn't talked to him in years, and then I ran into him at the airport. He's the one who encouraged me to look for my father. So you told him? Yes, but he knows how important this is to me, how much I care for all of you. He would never tell anyone. It seems you misplaced your trust. No, I haven't. I haven't! It was someone else. - You told someone else? - No, Peter! Look, I got this text message with a picture. That's me at the airport, and that's Josh, so it must have been sent by someone else. "Are you really his daughter?" He must have heard me talking. The airport was very noisy, so it never occurred to me that someone... So you think this Steve Decker took this picture? I don't know, Peter. If I saw him again, maybe I would recognize him. He's staying at the inn. I can go by first thing tomorrow and... try to explain. It's a little late for that. I'm sorry, Margaret. So am I. It's still early. I can call our lawyer and see if she can do anything to stop this Mr. Decker with his story. Everything okay? I should get back to our guests. There must be... something I can do to help. I would appreciate it if we could keep this among ourselves for the time being. Peter? [♪♪♪] Hey... you all right? No. Not even close. [♪♪♪] [Josh]: Wait... James Whitcomb? Like, the actor? That James Whitcomb? You mean the one with all the awards and everything, he's your father? James Whitcomb? [thump] Pardon me. I'm so sorry. So sorry. Pardon me. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. [shutter snapping] [♪♪♪] Mr. Decker. Miranda! I wasn't sure if you'd recognize me. You know, I've never actually been to Carlton Heath before. I mean, I've read about James Whitcomb and how this town was like his Fortress of Solitude, but this place, it's like one big Christmas card. That's why he loved it so much. Well, he sounds like a good man. Tell me. How come he never told anybody about you? Mr. Decker, you can't write this article. Excuse me? I care about this family very much. If this gets out, it will hurt them more than you know. Miranda, listen to me. I am not out to hurt anybody. Then you need to forget all about me. But I'm a writer. This is what I do. Put yourself in my shoes. How many times in my life is a story like this going to fall into my lap? You were never supposed to hear it in the first place. Then you never should have said it, not if you wanted to keep it a secret. That's the first rule of journalism. Look. You were right about James Whitcomb. He was more than an actor. He was a good man who did a lot of good for other people. This will change the way the world sees him. Well, then I would say you have a choice to make. What? I mean, the world's going to hear about this story one way or the other. At least, if you speak with me, tell me your side of things, you can make sure that people still remember James Whitcomb, your father, as a good man. I... Look. It's Christmas Eve tomorrow night. Now, I'm gonna be heading home to start writing my story. I sure hope I hear from you before I leave town. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Hey, love. It's me. Again. I don't know where you are, but... Uh, now I do. Hey. Hey. What are you doing out here? I just wanted to sit for a minute. Well, come on. It's freezing. Let's go inside. Can we maybe talk out here? Just for a little while? I checked with Mom. She said Decker's out right now. Yeah, I know, I talked to him. I just couldn't change his mind. He's writing the story, and everyone will know. Look. Peter said he'll talk to their lawyer. There may still be some legal options here. Do you remember when I told you that this is all I ever wanted? Mm-hmm. Be a part of a family? To love you the way I do? I just knew it wouldn't last. Love, what is it? I think I need to go back to Seattle. Oh, we're doing this again? No. Ian, listen. It's the only way that when this comes out, it won't be an embarrassment to the entire family. What about us? I love you, Ian. That's good. [sad chuckle] But I don't know how we can start a life together here after all this. Every day's just going to be a reminder of what I've done, the hurt that I've caused, and... How can I do that to you? I can't take you away from Carlton Heath. This is your home, this is where you belong. I just... I have to go. Can I show you something first? And if you still want to leave after that, well... Thank you. Mm-hmm. I don't understand. You said this is the right kind of place to start a life together. I couldn't agree more. I think Margaret's ready to sell, and I know I'm ready to buy. If this is really what you want, Miranda, we can. And you're right, Carlton Heath is my home. But it's your home now too. It's our home. And it's right here, waiting for us. You just don't get it. How can they ever trust me again? I don't get it? [chuckles incredulously] I don't get it? That's not what I meant. So, what? You... You somehow think that running away is gonna make up for that? Ian, I'm not running away. Yes, you are! You're ready to leave right now. It's not the same. - Yes, it is. - No, it's not. You just don't understand. I understand we waited a long time to find each other, to start our lives together. Well, this is where it begins. This moment, right here, when we decide that our love is stronger than anything that could ever try to come between us. Stay... and I promise you, that will never change. I can't stay. It will only make things harder than they already are. I love you. [footsteps receding] [hammer tapping] [door opens] Ian? Margaret. Hey, I was out walking, and I saw the lights. You're working late. Yeah. Just wanted to... you know. Get this finished before, uh... ...before the holidays. Where is Miranda? She's leaving? [Ian sighs] Ian... [sighing] [♪♪♪] [sighing] [sighing] [phone buzzing] [♪♪♪] This is where we always put our Christmas tree, too. And at night... with all the windows, you could see it from clear across that field. It's the perfect place. Yeah, James and I used to take walks out there at night just so we could look at it. "Our Christmas beacon," he called it. Drawing us home. [chuckling] I can't believe we used to talk that way. Margaret, your text was... You said you wanted to talk, so... Ian told me that you're leaving. I think, given the circumstances, it would be for the best. Best for whom? For the family. Family is the most important thing. Which is why sometimes, being strong is staying for the family, not leaving. Did you ever hear the story of how we bought this cottage? James had just been cast in his first Broadway show. I don't even remember the name of it, but he had a day off, and we wanted to get out of the city, so we took a drive. How we ended up here, in Carlton Heath, I will never know, but... we fell in love with it, and with this cottage. So you bought it? Oh, heavens, no. We couldn't afford it then. But the show had a good long run, and there were other shows, and eventually, we scraped together enough a down payment. No, this was our very first real home. Must have been wonderful. Well, we spent more and more time here. It was wonderful in every season, but... something about Christmas... Christmas was the most special. And the two of you wrote that up there? That was, uh, the poet in him, I suppose. James always believed that truth and grace were the two most important qualities in any life. Truth in particular was very important to him. So why did you cover it up? I loved my husband very deeply, Miranda. When he told me about your mother, about his feelings for her, I couldn't forgive him. I just couldn't bear to look at those words anymore, and so I covered them up. But you did forgive him. With time, and grace... we stayed together, we worked things out, and, yes, I forgave him. And then, last Christmas, I met you. Margaret, I-I'm so sorry. I never meant to embarrass y... No, no, no. You don't understand. You and I met, and I had a year to recognize that I was trying to cover up the truth, just the way I covered up those words. I had some idea that if I just kept this secret, it would be honoring James' memory, but I couldn't have been more wrong. What do you mean? I told you, Miranda. You are strong, like he was. You were ready to leave, to walk away from the one you love, for the sake of your family. James would have been so proud of you. And he would have told the truth about you and your mother. That's what he would want, and that's what we shall do. Margaret... I let Steve Decker find out. He's writing the story. And that is what finally made me realize what needs to be done. Now, this is not Steve Decker's story to tell. It is our story... The story of a family that finds each other at Christmas, and comes together, with grace and truth. Thank you. Thank you. Now what? Uh, yes, Ms. Garrett? This is Margaret Whitcomb. I wonder if you might have a few more minutes to talk before you go? [♪♪♪] Hi. Hi. You probably want to... put that down. Put these down? O-Okay. [♪♪♪] [chuckling] [Natalie]: "By the lake shore in the moon glow, first time, only time, as it was at the beginning of time, beguiling eve once, now ever in this failed heart." And Eve is... He's writing about your mother? Yes. So you never knew that James Whitcomb was your father? No, I f... um... we... found out last Christmas. Because of this? A photograph of a little boy on Father Christmas's lap? Well, there is a stamp on the back that says the name of the town, so that was... that helped. But you're telling me that you traveled 3,000 miles, all the way across the country, because "Carlton Heath" was stamped on the back of a photograph? Mm-hmm. I lost my mother when I was very young, so she never had the chance to tell me who my father was. Every Christmas I'm reminded that when I lost my mother, I lost any hope of knowing my family. When I found that picture... I found my family. And then I found Christmas. That is so... Nice. So... how soon can you write the story? Uh, well, I can get a draft to my editor after the holidays... You have until noon tomorrow. W-What? Mrs. Whitcomb, that's... That's not how this works. Ms. Garrett, this story is no longer just about James. It's a story about Christmas and family, and what those things mean to all of us. Now, tomorrow is Christmas Eve. What better time to tell a Christmas story? Yes, but... And if you don't have this online by tomorrow, I promise you someone else will, and then we will lose our chance to tell this story right, the way it deserves to be told. I will call my editor. Good! I like her. Me too. [both chuckling] [♪♪♪] [door opens] Ian? Oh, hey! I was... I thought you might need a ride home. I'm staying here, remember? Right. Yeah. I knew that. Have you been waiting out here this whole time? I figured this thing could go either way, so I decided to stay around. You know, just in case. Thank you. So...? Is she writing the story? Let's go someplace. I'll tell you all about it. Right. ♪ Ding-dong ♪ ♪ Christmas song ♪ Oh, my. What? [gasps] Wow! Well done, Miranda. Well done. That's a good story. Well written. Yes, it is. And it's about time. Yes, it is. ♪ Christmas, Christmas Christmas song ♪ ♪ Ding-dong ♪ ♪ Sing along ♪ [heavy sigh] You were right, Mr. Decker. One way or another, the world was gonna hear this story... but it's my story to tell, not yours. Merry Christmas. Skates! - Oh-ho-ho! - [adults chuckling] - Do you like them? - Yes! Miranda... this is for you. Thank you. From the family. Um... Open it! Okay! [Margaret]: Peter's having our attorney draw up the papers, and we can meet with her after the holidays to go over all the details... make it official. I'm sorry. What? What... um... What papers? I know that James would have wanted you to have the cottage... so you can start out your marriage there, just the way that we did. [Mark]: And Grandma insists that we can call you "Aunt Miranda," if that's okay with you? I would like that very much. [laughing] This is your family now, and now you have a home here, with us. I don't know what to say! Thank you. Welcome home. [Ian]: Hoo! Now, I don't know what it's like in Seattle, but people around here like to spend Christmas Night cozied up by a big fire. There it is. What are we looking at? He was right. It's just there, across the field. Who was right? My father. "Like a Christmas beacon," he said. "Drawing us home." I like that. Me too. I just had a great idea. Mm-hmm? Wouldn't that be a perfect place to get married next Christmas? Yes, it would. [♪♪♪]
