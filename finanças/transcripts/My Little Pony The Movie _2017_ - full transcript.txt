# Hey! Hey! Hey! # # Hey! Hey! Hey! # See the ponies trottin' down the street # # Equestria is where they wanna meet # # They all know where they wanna go # # And they're trottin' in time # # And they're trottin', yeah, they got the beat # # They got the beat, they got the beat # # Yeah, they got the beat # # Go-go music really makes us dance # # Do the Pony puts us in a trance # # Do the Watusi just give us a chance # # That's when we fall in line # # 'Cause we got the beat # # We got the beat, we got the beat # # Yeah, we got it # Huh? Excuse me! Dragon on the move! Important Princess Documents coming through! Wow! Everypony from Manehattan to Saddle Arabia is here! I know, filly. We almost couldn't book a stable! Princess Twilight must have her hooves full with this giant festival! Are you kidding? She's smart and organized and cool under pressure. There's nothing she can't handle! My goodness! I can't handle this! Nothing is working! I just have to get it together. Just go in there. And ask! This is your Friendship Festival. Every pony's happiness rests in your hooves. Okay, Twilight. Got all your charts and graphs! Oh, thank goodness you're here, Spike. I'm just so nervous about this meeting. What you talkin' about? I'm about to ask the three most royal princesses of Equestria for a huge favor. What if they reject me? It'll be fine! Just remember the most important thing. Smile? Uh, no. You're a princess, too! Right. Good morning, Princesses! Thank you all for seeing me. I have an idea that I think will make our Friendship Festival the most wonderful celebration Equestria has ever seen. Yes, Twilight, we are very excited. Ponies have been arriving from all over all morning. I'd like to think it's to see us but Songbird Serenade might be the bigger attraction. Yes, she is the "mane" event. And to make it extra special, I could use your help. Spike? Songbird Serenade's performance is not scheduled to start until after you begin the sunset. And based on my precise calculation to get the very best lighting for the stage, Princess Celestia, I was hoping you could make sure the sun stays about 28.1 degrees to the south. And Princess Luna, if you could raise the moon 62 degrees to the north at the same time, it would reflect the sunlight on the other side and really frame the entire stage perfectly! - I... - But wait, there's more! Cadance, if you could use your crystal magic to create an aurora above the stage the sun and the moon will shine through it and create a truly amazing light show! Presenting Songbird Serenade! # Yeah, yeah, yeah # Whoa. Whoa! Tada! So, you're saying you want us to move the sun and the moon for the party? Well, I'd do it myself except I don't have your magic. Twilight... Each of us uses our powers to serve Equestria in our own way. You are the Princess of Friendship. You already have all the magic you need. So that'd be a no? Yes! Skies cleared and ready for the festival! Heads up, Fluttershy! Out of control balloon! I don't think it's the balloon that's out of control, Pinkie Pie. Hey, y'all! Anypony up for some free samples of my family's apple cider? Ah! Thank you. Loved it. Wow, Rarity, that's a fine job you're doing there. 'Course it might not get done till after the concert. Applejack, darling, anypony can do fine. Twilight asked me. So clearly, she's going for fabulous. And fabulous takes time. Fabulous takes forever. But awesome... Whoa! Can get done in four seconds flat. Faster if I do my Sonic Rainboom. No, no, no, no! Don't you dare, Rainbow Dash! It looks wretched enough already. Oh, come on, it's fine. If you were raised in a barn! No offense, Applejack. None taken. 'Specially since I wasn't raised in a barn. My family just happens to have a barn, where I was born. And spent most of my formative years. Raised in a barn! Okay, just 218 things left to do, and we're ready. Hey, Twilight. Hello, Spike. Uh, hi, Rarity. How'd it go with the other princesses? They like your idea? I bet they loved it! Not exactly. They think I can make today perfect without their magic. And they are absolutely right, darling. This festival is your brilliant idea, and we know you're up to the task. But what if I'm not? What if Songbird Serenade hates the stage? Or nopony makes a new friend? And if I fail at the festival, then who am I? Twilight, look at me. This will be the biggest celebration Equestria has ever seen! As the Princess of Friendship, you cannot fail! This day will define who you are! The pressure is intense! It's almost too much for any single pony to handle! But you have us! So stop worrying. # It's time to show 'em what you've got # # It's time to go and get things done # # But you don't have to do it on your own # # 'Cause you've got friends right here to make it fun # # We got this You got this # # We got this together # Sometimes the pressure gets you down # # And the clouds are dark and gray # # Just kick them off and let the sun shine through # # And scary as it seems more help is on the way # # 'Cause friends have friends that want to help out too # # We got this You got this # # We got this together # # It's the Festival of Friendship # # And we can get it done # # A festival that they won't forget # # A party to be proud of A day of games and fun # # Just you wait and see A magic day in perfect harmony # # You got this # # We got this together # # With friends and family you are never alone # # If you need help we've got your back # # You can be honest Let your problems be known # # 'Cause you got us to pick up the slack # # We got this # Eyup! # We got this together # # Pay attention to the details # # Every gem even spaced make the colors perfect # # Taking one or two to taste # # Inside and out beautiful throughout # # Generosity is what we're all about # # We got this # # You got this # # We got this together # # Today needs to be perfect It all comes down to me # # I don't know if I'm ready # # For all the things they need me to be # # I am the Princess of Friendship # # But that is more than just a crown # # It's a promise to bring ponies together # # And never let anypony down # # We've got an awful lot to bake # # Each pony needs a piece of cake # # Oh, wait!

Oopsie! Guess my easy bake confetti cake cannon needs a little bit more finetuning. Songbird Serenade! Is it really her? It is, it is! Hiya! I'm looking for the pony in charge. I need to set up for my sound check. Ms. Songbird Serenade? Um, I was just going to check on you. I'm Princess Twilight. And sorry about the mess. I'm usually not so... Oh! How embarrassing! Caked in cake? You have visual on buttercream? Visual confirmed. Go for cleanup. Storm clouds? I ordered perfect weather! Rainbow Dash! Uh... I don't think those are storm clouds. Ooh. I bet those are the clowns I ordered! You are definitely not the clowns I ordered. Brian, no! Ponies of Equestria! We come on behalf of the fearsome, the powerful, the almighty, Storm King! This is terrible. And now, to deliver the evil, evil message, put your hooves together for Commander Tempest! Is that a unicorn? I think so, but what happened to her horn? Tempest, is it? How may we help you? Ah, I'm so glad you asked. How about we start with your complete and total surrender? What? What? Hi, there, Princess of Friendship. Not exactly sure what's going on, but I know we can talk things out. Oh, goodie. All four princesses. Here's the deal, ladies. I need your magic. Give it up nicely, please, or we make it difficult. For everyone. And why should we cower before you? There's one of you, and hundreds of us. I was hoping you'd choose difficult. - Cadance! - Argh! I can't stop it! Luna, quick! Go south! Beyond the badlands! Seek help from the Queen of the Hippo... Luna! Twilight! Easy as pie. Oh, I love pie. Oh, you totally got the last princess. That's not the Princess. Grubber! Get her now! Guys, we gotta get the Princess! Over here, y'all! Come on! Which one of you guys are going down there? I would, but I just had a hearty meal and I will sink and I will side cramp. I'm very big-boned. I sink quick. Everypony okay? I think my bottom's on backward. We just got our cupcakes handed to us by the worst party crasher ever! We gotta go back there and fight! You saw the size of those goons! Do you seriously wanna go back? So, now what? We can't hide here forever and let's be honest, we can't go back. Look at what they did to the princesses. We've got to keep them from Twilight. The Queen... Yeah, the Queen! Uh, what queen? Celestia told Luna to find the Queen of the Hippos. Luna can't, so I have to. Uh, hippos? Seriously? I've heard they're surprisingly graceful for their size. But they're always hungry. - Hungry? - Hippos? They're somewhere south, past the badlands. But that means we'll have to leave Equestria. Ooh! I'm not even packed! I understand you're scared, and nopony else has to go. But I have to find this queen. She might be our only hope. Well, you're not getting all the glory. We're in this together. - We got yer back! - Indeedy! I am ready to save Equestria! Yay. We're all behind you, Twilight. Let's go find this hippo! Uh, south? Boingy, boingy, boingy, boingy, boingy. Anypony up for a game of "I Spy?" No really, come on! I spy with my little eye something that is orange. No takers? It's you, Applejack! All this power, wasted on parties. When there are far greater uses. Well, answer it! Where am I supposed to be looking? I never understand how this spell works. Tempest! Over here, Your Excellency. - Where? Huh? - Over here. No. No, right. Look right. - My right? - Yep. Oh, there you are. Here's the deal. I'm in the middle of a big rebrand here. "The Storm King" is tracking well, as "intensely intimidating." But you know what? I need to back it up. You know what I need to back it up with? A storm! That would be great! You promised me magic that could control the elements and right now, I'm holding a what? A branch, a twig. Blegh. Uh, that would be The Staff of Sacanas, Your Excellency - and it will channel the magic... - Mm-hmm. ...of the four rulers of this land. You'll soon have the power of 100 armies. So, that would be a "yes" on you locking down the four pegacornicuses or whatever you call them? Give me three days. I'll have everything ready for your arrival. Remember, Tempest, only I have the power to make you whole. Make this twig work, and you'll get your reward. Fail me, and your horn won't be the only thing that's broken. It won't be a problem. Great! I'm ready to power up, crash and bash, and be the biggest, baddest bugaloo! Sorry. Bad spell service. You want me to call him back? Do you have the Princess? Well, uh, funny story. It kind of seems like she... She might have, like, you know, gotten away. A little bit. I know you're disappointed, but I got one word for you. Spongecake. I need all four for the staff to work. Hey, I know. I want the Storm King to fix that crazy horn as badly as you do. It looks like a crackly, chipped tooth on the top of your head and you know you don't look good in hats. That princess is not gonna keep me from getting my horn back. Prepare my ship! Please. How far can one little pony get on her own? Guys, sand's in my everything. Saving Equestria. Oh, look! Maybe this guy knows which way to go! What's that, friend? We're lost? We could be going in circles. Endless sand. Nothing for miles but sand... And this rock... And this cactus... And this road. This road. - Hmm? - A road? Where there's a road, there's a... Whoa! Cool! What is that? Ooh! A city! We are doing it, you guys! You know what they say, "Where there's a city, there's a spa!" Who says that? In case you forgot, we're on a mission to save Equestria. I can multitask. Don't worry, little one, we'll let you go. To the highest bidder! Nice! Storm King bobbleheads! Ooh. Hey. You with the horn. You selling? Oh. Ooh! Hi, there. Oh, I'm sorry. Here, let me help you with that. Hey, no magic around my merchandise! Hmm? Very interesting. Okay, we just gotta stick together. Be careful who you talk to, and try to blend in. Can I have your attention, please? Can anypony take us to the Queen of the Hippos? You want something, you gotta give somethin'. Well, how about a big warm hug from a grateful pony friend? How about this comb that I've never used? A picture of my sister Maud? This breath mint? Seriously, buddy. Help me help you. Pinkie, you can't just take off. And you don't need to announce to every... Relax, Twilight, I've totally got this. How much for the giant gecko? Who you callin' a gecko? Uh, Spike isn't for sale. I want that fancy purple hair! I'll give you two Storm Bucks for it. Two Storm Bucks? It's worth more than that. Heh? - Give me that pink one! - I'll take the blue one! - No, I want the blue one! - I need that lizard! I'll take the picture of your sister! I want all seven for my collection. Back up, everyone! Back it up. Y'all in some serious danger! Now, you didn't touch any of them, did you? Just look at all those colors. You think that's natural? They're infected with pastelus coloritis. Now you listen here, fella, there ain't... Don't worry, don't worry. As long as you're not covered in purple splotches, you'll be fine. Uh-oh. What do I do? Enjoy your last moments. And don't touch anyone. Because parts will fall off. Me parts! Well, all right. - You are awesome! - Mm-hmm. And quite charming. Capper's the name. Charming's my game. So, to the hippos then? I don't know if we should trust him. We could definitely use a friend out here. You know what? Little Cotton Candy Hair is right. And if I do say so myself... # This town is not a nice place # # For little fillies all alone # # There are lots of twists and corners # # That could lead to the unknown # # Let me guide your way # # And I'll be sure to help you through # # You could really use a friend out here # # And luckily for you # # I'm the friend that you need # # When you're lost and don't know what to do # # I'm your pal, your amigo Useful and resourceful, too # # And my help, you'll concede, is a plus guaranteed # # You can call and I'll come running, just follow my lead # # 'Cause I'm the friend you need # - # He's a friend # - # Quite a friend # # He's a friend indeed # # You need a bud to spot the danger # # A pal to stop the creep # # A chum and not a stranger to assist # # You need a bro who is cunning # # That can help you take the leap # # A friend who knows what's lying in the mist # # Don't fear these darkened alleys # # They're scary, yes, I know # # Why you could use a friend to protect you wherever you go # # And such a dazzling beauty covered in dirt and muck # # But now your fate is changing # # Now you are in luck # # 'Cause I'm the friend that you need # # When you're lost and don't know what to do # # I'm your pal, your amigo # # Looking out for friends like you # # And my help, you'll concede, is a plus guaranteed # # Just call and I'll come running, we'll say it's agreed # Here. Tell Verko, my place, 20 minutes. I've got something that will "magically" erase all my debt. # 'Cause I'm the friend you need # # He's a friend # # Quite a friend # # He's a friend indeed # Welcome, my little ponies, to my little manor. Ooh, sort of a Rocohobo Bohemian hodgepodge. Apologies for the state of my litter box. I wasn't expecting guests. Ooh, so many fun breakables! Whoa! Y'all sure y'all want the hippos? Yessiree! The Queen of the Hippos. Not like the queen of the lions, or tigers, or bears? - Oh, my! - Huh? Please, please, I don't know anything! You really think the ponies got this far? Oh, they're here. Attention. A little purple pony passed this way. Tell me where she is. Or somethin' real bad's gonna happen. You think we're gonna fall for this again? I don't know what kind of scam you're workin' with Capper and the rest of your friends, but... Friends? Poison or no poison, you're gonna pay. Oh! Fishman just got dropped! Now... About this Capper... Stop playin' me. A Sonic Rainboom? That's not a real thing. Is that a real thing? I'll show ya! No, no, no. I don't need you Sonic Rainbooming up in my place. Thank you very much. Whoa, hey. Hold up now. Whoa. Here you go. I do apologize. If we were back home, I could have done something truly fabulous. Okay. - What's the catch? - Nothing. After all that you've done for us? Consider it a "thank you." Oh. Don't thank me. Really. Guys! We've been looking for the wrong queen! We don't need the Queen of the Hippos. We need the Queen of the Hippogriffs! Part pony, part eagle. Oh! Oh, the Hippogriffs? Now the trouble with that is, no one knows where they are. Says here they're on the top of Mount Aris. You mean the mountain right outside the window? Objects in windows may be less mountainous than they appear. Let's go, everypony. Wait! You can't... you can't make it by yourselves! You'd need an airship. And lucky for you, I can get you a ride. I think we can get there on our own. Here's Verko! These ponies better shoot rainbow lasers out their eyes if they're gonna settle your debt. Brought the big cage. Let's load 'em up! You were... You were going to sell us? I knew it! We gotta get out of here! Silly little ponies. Tempest! Trusting strangers? Big mistake. Big. Huge! My goodness! Well, look at you! With your scary broken horn and scowly eyes. What tricks do you know, my little pony wony? Not bad. Go, go! Get her now! You gonna be scared now, ponies! I'm gonna... Be... Sick! We have to get there, to the docks! Hurry! That's it. Don't look down now. Yay! Whoa! Pinkie! Best escape plan ever! What? Shh. Did you hear something? Yeah, probably just the rats. If we find 'em, we'll eat 'em. Rats? Now... Where are they going? Okay. No need for violence. Uh, they're headed... They're headed east. Yeah, to Black Skull Island. So, uh, glad I could be of service to His Majesty, the Storm King. I'll just be on my way. When I get my princess. Until then, your fate is still up in the air. Oh, you're gonna go in the skiff. Which is a boat, specifically, a air boat! We make a great team. I love it how you said his fate is up in the air and then I said, "You're gonna be in the air in the air boat." Ugh. What do you think, Twilight? Should we just ask 'em to take us? The last time we trusted somepony, he tried to sell us. Hey, guys, come check this out. Looks like a pack of stowaways. What are we s'posed to do with them? I think we tie 'em up. Nah, we clip their wings! Nah, we scar 'em... Emotionally! Wait, wait, wait, wait. What say the book, Captain Celaeno? Storm King's rulebook says... "Throw them overboard." Arr. All right, that's lunch! What? Whoa, whoa, whoa! So, you were about to toss us overboard, and you stopped for a lunch break? Storm King only allows one break a day for meals then it's back to hauling goods. - So, you're delivery guys? - And gals. These uniforms aren't exactly doing us any favors. Then, can you deliver us to Mount Aris? Sorry. We do what the Storm King orders, or we suffer his wrath. Right, still going overboard. It's nothing personal. Pudding? There's pudding? You weren't always delivery birds, were you? What about before the Storm King? Yeah, we used to be much more adventurous. Ooh! I met that guy in the desert! Whoa! You used to be pirates? Um, we prefer the term, "Swashbuckling Treasure Hunters." So, pirates. You birds have a choice to make. You can let some cloven-hoofed Storm King tell you how to live your lives or you can be awesome again! Rainbow Dash, this really isn't a good time for a... # I know the world can get you down # ...song. # Things don't work out quite the way that you thought # # Feeling like all your best days are done # # Your fears and doubts are all you've got # # But there's a light shining deep inside # # Beneath those fears and doubts # # So just squash 'em # # And let it shine for all the world to see # # That it is time, yeah, time to be awesome # # Ah, ah, ah, ah, awesome! # # It's time to be so awesome # # Ah, ah, ah, ah, awesome! # # It's time to be so awesome # # You've no idea how hard it's been # # It's time to be awesome # # This dull routine we've been forced to do # # Don't let them rob you of who you are # - # Be awesome, it's all up to you # - # Be awesome # # I feel the light stirring deep inside # # It's like a tale still yet to be told # # It's time to be # # And now it's time to break the shackles free # # And start living like the brave and the bold # # It's time to be awesome! # - # Let loose, be true # - # So awesome! # # It's time to be awesome! # - # Go big, be you # - # So awesome! # # We used to soar through the clouds in the skies # # Elaborate schemes we would love to devise # # We rescued our treasure and stored it away # # Saving those gemstones for a rainy day! # # We see that light filling up our skies # # So take the Storm King's orders and toss 'em # # 'Cause it's the time to let our colors fly # # Hey, scallywags, it's time to be awesome # # Hey! # # Hey! # # Hey! # # Hey! # Come on, let's show these little ponies how it's done! Ooh. Awesome! I knew you had it in you! And now, for the finishing touch! Rainboom, rainboom! - Rainboom, rainboom! - No, no, no... No! Ah, yeah! Wow! Oh! Huh? Look at that rainbow! Look at that rainbow! Whoa, that's so cool. Yeah, of them to alert us. Funny though, they don't seem to be heading to Black Skull Island. Like, "Haha" funny, or... Whoa! Yeah! Nice! Storm guards! Looks like they found you. Tempest! Secure the rigging! Lock down the cargo! Everyone, prepare to be boarded! Oh, goodness! You think she saw my Sonic Rainboom? Are you kidding me? Where is the pony princess? Princess? Princess, princess... Nope. All we're hauling is Storm King merchandise. You do realize that if you were to shelter fugitives the Storm King would be quite... explosive. We have to get off this ship before they tell Tempest we're here! We helped them get their mojo back. They're not gonna give us up! Whoa. I've got this. Now, I'm gonna to count to three, and if you don't tell me where they are, your ship is going down. One... - Hold this. - What are you doing? Two... Oh, this is intense. Three! What? Oh, for Celestia's sake! Whee! I can't look! What in the hay is she up to? Oh, thank goodness. Phew! Quick thinkin', Twilight! Yahoo! That was fun! Can we do it again? Next stop, Mount Aris! We're home free! All right! There's no ponies. But I found this. It's a kind of a cupcake, some sprinkles. Oh, yeah, and I found this, too. Wow. This is a real artist. Looks like they're heading to Mount Aris. Really? Mount... Mount Aris? I didn't... Well, that's my mistake. I didn't know that they... Mount Aris, my bad, I didn't... That's my bad. I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry. Now... About your betrayal. We had to crash the balloon at the bottom of the mountain? That's it! I simply cannot even! I have nothing. The bad guys have won! I'm so sorry! We're almost there! Will you stop saying that? No, really. We're actually here! This is it. Ooh! Well, I'll be. Hippogriffs, here we come! Ooh. Time to rest my hooves. Are we sure this is the right place? Hello? Is anypony home? No Hippogriffies here. Or here. Or here. Or here. Or here. Or here! Wait... Nope. This place is empty. But Celestia... The map... They have to be here. Something bad happened here. Something that turned this whole place into a ghost town. Ghost town? It's coming from over there. What was that? Hey! Wait up! Cannonball! Pinkie! She's gone. Now what? - Huh? - Woah! Oh, boy. I hate epic adventures. Way to leave it till the last minute, Twilight. I didn't make these bubbles. Then who did? Hello? We're looking for the Hippogriffs. How do I know I can trust you? Please. The Storm King invaded our land, and we need their help. The Storm King? I'm so glad I saved you guys! I'm totally taking you to my mom! Does your mother know where they are? She might have an idea. We're almost there. Wow! Mother! Look what I found! Is it another shell? - Mm-mmm. - Because I am telling you, if it is another shell, I am... Princess Skystar, what have you done? You know surface dwellers are forbidden here! Guards! No, no, no. Mom, please! It is so not like that! The Storm King is trying to destroy their home, too! We need to find the Hippogriffs. Do you know what happened to them? Well, of course I know. I'm the queen. I know everything. Oh, oh. It's such a good story. Don't you dare tell them! Once upon a time, like, a while ago, the Hippogriffs did live on Mount Aris. Did I not say don't tell them? But, hey, I'm just the queen. Don't mind me. Fine! I can't tell you. But if I could tell you, I'd say that that horned beast did show up to steal their magic. Seriously? But to keep it out of his clutches their brave and majestic leader, Queen Novo, hid them deep underwater where he could never go. We are... Well, we were the Hippogriffs! Tada! But I totally did not tell you that. Well, I guess the pearl is out the oyster now. I am Queen Novo. Hold on now, let me get this straight. When the Storm King came, you just abandoned your entire city and fled? We didn't flee, we swam. You know, in order to flee. But how? Oh! Can we show them? These are the first guests we've had in, like, forever! Can we? Can we? Can we... Well, I suppose I should make sure it still works. Careful now. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wow. Haha! These fins are divine! Hey, Applejack! I'll race ya to that coral! You're on! Woo-hoo! Ooh, try it, Fluttershy. Yay. Guys... Guys, what is happening? Aw, so cute! This is amazing! With this, we could transform everypony at home into something powerful enough to face the Storm King's army! Or it could end up in his greedy claws. - But... - Honey... I'm sorry about your home. I truly am. But my responsibility is to protect my subjects. The pearl... is not going anywhere. But we've come all this way. And you can't just hide down here, trapped forever. There's so much you're missing. We are 100% okay with that. Yes, Jamal? Ooh, time for my seaweed wrap. Yes, a massage, too. Mama needs her deep tissue. So that's it? We left home for nothin'? Oh, my gosh! Best idea. You can stay with us forever! There are so many things we can do. We could make friendship bracelets out of shells, and picture frames out of shells, and decorative waste baskets out of shells. Oh, I have so many projects that involve shells. Now I have someone new to share them with. I mean, aside from my friends, Shelly and Sheldon. Right, Shelly and Sheldon? Get it? Oh, oh! That sounds lovely, darling, but you must realize we can't stay. We've gotta get back to our families. Oh, no. Of course. Of course. Of course you have your own friends back home. It's fine. It's fine! Shelly and Sheldon get jealous anyways. It's probably for the best. Yeah, I'll just, um... I'll get Mom to turn you back so you can go home. I know we have to go, but you guys saw how disappointed Princess Skystar was. Couldn't we stay for just a little longer? Pinkie, we just don't have time... Oh, no. No, no. Pinkie's right. Say what now? Well, we still need to come up with a plan to get back. A few minutes won't make a huge difference. And if there's anypony who can cram a lifetime of fun into a blink of an eye, it's Pinkie Pie. So go ahead and show Skystar the best time ever! I won't let you down! I'm counting on it. It's probably for the best. # Hey, now, don't be sad # # I know we cannot stay # # But we've got a couple minutes and a little time to play # # I know you have important things # # So it's okay, just go # # But we can still pick one small little thing # # To do with you, you know! # # One small thing doesn't seem like a lot # # One small thing, work with the time you've got # # Soon one small thing becomes two # # After two perhaps another few # # Then one small thing is not so small # # One small thing can be the biggest thing of all! # # All right now since you're here # # Let's see what we can do # # Swim with the flow until you go # # Together me and you # # I've got necklaces for every fish! # # So what else do you got? # # Well, we could play the bubblefish # # You'll like this one a lot # # One small thing it's a good place to start # # Just one small thing # # One small thing and we don't seem so far apart # # Soon one small thing leads to more # # It's so much more than there was before # # Just one small thing and you will see # # The start of something big for you and me # - # One small thing # - # Just one small thing # - # Or a tall thing # - # Just one tall thing # - # Or a sing thing # - # Just one singy thing # - # Or a bling thing # - # Just one blingy thing # - # A conga thing # - # A conga thing # - # Or a longah thing # - # Just one longah thing # # A blue thing, true thing, you thing # # A wee thing, sea thing, me thing # # So many things and everything until our time is done # # There's one small thing for each and every one # # One small thing so much we can create # # You and me we started something great # # It's so amazing, look around # # At all the happy sights and sounds # # One small thing is big, it's true # # You did this all for us # # I just wish there was one small thing # # An extra special kind of thing # # That we could do for you # # One small thing # Well, I guess there is one small thing we can do. The pearl alarm! Oh, no! The pearl alarm! Ow. Ow. No! Please! All of this so you could sneak in and take the pearl? This is why we don't bring strangers into our home! You don't deserve to be one of us. What were you thinking? I mean, stealing their pearl? It was the only way to save Equestria! Except it wasn't! The queen was going to say yes! We did what you told us, and that's what made her realize we were ponies worth saving. Unless, you didn't really want us to show her the best time ever! You just wanted us to distract her! I never would have done it, but this isn't Equestria! We can't just dance around with con artists, make rainbooms in the sky, and expect everything to work out! It's not enough. We are not enough! No, Twilight. We stuck together. We were gonna get the help we needed. The only thing that stopped us was you. Well, I'm doing the best I can! It's all on me. I'm the one Tempest wants. I'm the last princess! You're also the only one who doesn't trust her friends! Well, maybe I would have been better off without friends like you! Pinkie, I... I just can't talk to you right now. Twilight... It's okay. You'll figure it out. No. I can't. I ruined everything. There's no chance to save Equestria now. It's all my fault. Spike? Twilight, look out! No, no, no! Spike! Twilight! Aw, the Princess of Friendship with no friends. And no way out. Why are you doing this? You're a pony, just like me. I'm nothing like you. I'm more than you'll ever be. # It's time you learned a lesson # # It's time that you understand # # Don't ever count on anybody else # # In this or any other land # # I once hoped for friendship # # To find a place among my kind # # But those were the childish wishes # # Of someone who was blind # # Open up your eyes # # See the world from where I stand # # Me among the mighty # # You caged at my command # # Open up your eyes # # Give up your sweet fantasy land # # It's time to grow up and get wise # # Come now, little one # # Open up your eyes # # We all start out the same with simple naive trust # # Shielded from the many ways that life's not fair or just # # But then there comes a moment # # A simple truth that you must face # # If you depend on others # # You'll never find your place # # And as you take that first step # # Upon a path that's all your own # # You see it all so clearly # # The best way to survive is all alone # # Open up your eyes # # See the world from where I stand # # Me among the mighty # # You caged at my command # # Open up your eyes # # And behold the faded light # # It's time to grow up and get wise # # Come now, little one # # Open up your eyes # # Open up your eyes # I'm so sorry you felt so alone. I saw the truth. My friends abandoned me when times got tough. Looks like I'm not the only one. Face it, Princess. Friendship has failed you too. Friendship didn't fail me. I failed friendship. This whole journey was such a mistake. All we wanted was somepony to help us. You think maybe it's time we talk to Twilight? She's been taken! What? Twilight's been taken! Tempest! She grabbed her and took her on her ship! - We gotta get her back! - How? We'll never catch up. And we got no way to defeat those monsters. Well, good thing I happen to know of a group of mighty heroes that could handle this easily. Well, look what the cat dragged in. Himself! These heroes have faced the Storm King's army and escaped. I've seen them tackle the streets of the roughest towns, break out of the tightest situations, and inspire others to join their cause. Ooh! Now, don't get too excited. He's just talking about us. They even escaped certain doom at the hooves of Commander Tempest. Yeah, that was pretty great. Are you kidding me? That was awesome! Figured you could use a claw. We're onboard to help you fight the Storm King. Just not on board our actual ship. That crazy unicorn sunk it, but you got back our argh. And we're ready to kick some booty. Is that what I think it is? Hello! Me again! I'm gonna get so grounded. But I talked things over with Shelly and Sheldon, and they pointed out that you were just trying to help your friends. So, I wanna help, too. Because, you know, one small thing... Can make a really big difference. That's it, right? We didn't make friends with anypony else? All right, y'all. I think our course is clear. Y'all ready to do this thing? We're coming, Twilight! Yeah! As soon as we bake up a plan! # I am here and I see your pain # # Through the storm through the clouds, the rain # # I'm telling you, you cannot escape # Tempest, don't do this. Don't give the Storm King... Your magic? Did you think you'd keep it all to yourself? Time to share. I'd love for everybody out there to know what I can really do. Ooh, fascinating. What can you really do? Your bidding, of course, your mighty one. Bidding's good. I like bidding! Um, what are you supposed to be? I'm the Princess of Friendship. Oh! That's nice. Why is this one still moving? She and her friends put up a bit of a fight, but she's alone now. She won't be a problem. Yeah. So, speaking of problems, this place, it seems a little too, oh, I don't know, cute! I don't like cute. I never did like cute. Doesn't really go with my whole big, bad, powerful magic guy thing, does it? Deliver the punch line, Tempest, because this has gotta be a joke! Huh? No! Check out the light show! Wow! Let's get this storm started! Ooh, hey, that's good, I should trademark that. Not bad. Actually, kind of first rate. What else does it do? Your Excellency, you promised to restore my horn, and give... Uh, uh, uh... Okay, hang on. You gotta be kidding me! I can move the sun? Whoa! Now this is what I'm talkin' about! Time to play! Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday! Day, night, day, night, day, night, day, night, day, night, sunrise, sunset... Uh, yeah. I got a delivery here for a "Mr. The Storm King." I was given explicit instructions to bring this here cake to this here castle's throne room. All right, then. Look here, could one of y'all go be a pal, go tell your boss he's not getting his "Congratulations on subduing defenseless pastel ponies" cake? 'Cause I don't want to be the one responsible for the big guy missin' his special dessert... You know what I'm sayin'? Thank you kindly, fellas. I'mma be sure and put in a good word for the both of y'all. Pinkie, quit lookin' so happy. Y'ain't foolin' nopony. Oh, okay! Mmm, pie. Oh, hello, cake. Ooh, don't mind if I do. Mmm. It's some, like, gourmet icing. Who puts eyeballs in filling? Guards! Uh-oh. Plan B? The jig is up! Come on! Gotcha! Argh! Lovely. Surprise! Double surprise! Whee! Oh! You seem tense. Do you wanna talk about it? Yeah! Head for the castle! We'll hold them off! Come on! Let it all out. Fluttershy! Oh, sorry, our time is up, buh-bye! Buh-bye. Keep going! Shelly, Sheldon... I can't see! Uh-oh. Hey, ain't you a firebreathin' dragon? What? How? - It's... It's the magic of... - Yeah, yeah. Friendship and flowers and ponies, and blegh! I'm so totally over the cute pony thing. This ends now! Uh-oh. Yeah! Move them hooves, ponies! You'd have to be flying faster than a speeding Pegasus to break through that wind! Excellent idea, Rainbow Dash! Now, I truly am the Storm King! And the entire world will bow to my ba-ba-ba-boom, baby! Yes, yes you are every bit as powerful as I promised, sire. Now, restore my horn and I swear to use my magic to serve you. Who cares about your dinky little unicorn horn? But we, we had an agreement. Get with the program! I used you. It's kind of what I do. Argh! Hold on! Why are you saving me? Because this is what friends do. Aw, isn't that just so sweet. Yeah. See ya. You sure about this? Yes, do it! Thank you! I'm excited. Who's excited? I've never been so excited! Whee! Bullseye! Pinkie! You all came back! I'm so sorry! I was wrong to... I'm sorry, too! Friends mess up sometimes, but we never should... Uh, make up later! This isn't over! I've got to get control of it! Go! You've got this, Twilight! No. We've got this. Together. Whee! The staff belongs to me! No! That's my staff! Mine! Mine! No! - Oh, no, no! - Whoa! Twilight! No! Yay! - Yeehaw! All right! - Yay. Group hug! No! Whoa. I can't believe she did that. I can. Now what? Now, we fix everything. Ah! Twilight! Princesses! Fillies and gentlecolts! Get ready for a little... Songbird Serenade! And now, to celebrate the fact that we're all still here in one piece, give it up for Princess Twilight and her friends! All right! Way to go, guys! Yeah! # I know you, you're a special one # # Some see crazy where I see love # # You fall so low # # But shoot so high # # Big dreamers shoot for open sky # # So much life in those open eyes # # So much depth you look forward to life # - Ooh. - And perfection. # But when your wounds open, you will cry # Mom! You are so grounded. # I can see a rainbow # # In your tears as they're fallin' down # # I can see your soul grow # # Through the pain as they hit the ground # # I can see a rainbow # # In your tears as the sun comes out # # As the sun comes out # Well, that's one thing that never changes around here. A party. Well, I hope you'll stay. More friends are definitely merrier. But, um... My horn? You know... your horn is pretty powerful, just like the pony it belongs to. I did tell you I wanted to show everypony in Equestria what I could do, right? # I can see a rainbow # # In your tears as they're fallin' down # # I can see your soul grow # # Through the pain as they hit the ground # Nice touch, Tempest. Actually, that's not my real name. Ooh! What is it? It's Fizzlepop Berrytwist. Okay!
