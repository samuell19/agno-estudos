(BELL ROCKS) (CONFUSED VOICES) - Congratulations! - Well done! - It must be male! - God bless you! - Thanks! - Hey! - Sons! - Thanks! - What a lovely couple! - Thank you thank you. Man is not a man ... if he is not a father! (APPLAUSE AND CRY OF APPROVAL) What have you got, Miuzza ?! Help me! Miuzza! Give me a hand! My wife feels bad! Miuzza! Help me! Miuzza! Miuzza! Help me! Don't leave me alone! Miuzza! Give me a hand! Don't leave me alone! Call the doctor! (THE DOCTOR laughs) Quick, a priest! Miuzza! On! (TOWARDS OF AMAZING) (TOWARDS OF AMAZING) Madonna ... - Oh ... oh ... - Stop it, this belly! No! Give me a hand! My wife breaks out! (EXPLOSION) (LOLLO CRIES) Lollo, love, here's the coffee! But what have you done? You are all wet. I pissed on myself. Are you happy? Who put this deal up ?! Ah, good morning, Don Vincenzo! Do you know that on Sunday you have to carry the statue of the Virgin in procession? - I'm sorry but I can not. - Are you crazy? How can you not ?! I am a sinner. Last time you denied me absolution! Of course, come and confess that you don't want children! What are you listening to ?! Move the cart! Talk about rubbing salt in my wounds - d'oh! Coitus interruptus where does the secret of confession go ?! But if everyone knows! And you continue to be the '' mammone cat ''! A sinner cannot carry that statue, he would defile it. - Lollo! - Huh? - Wait up! (in Latin) I absolve you in the name of the Father, of the Son ... ..and of the Holy Spirit, amen. Here, so see you on Sunday. At 08:00 precisely! (softly) What a 'whorehouse' priest. You have to drink a tablespoon of it in a cup of hot water every night. - I don't shit anyway. - This works. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening everyone. - One minute and I'm with her. - I'm in no hurry, for what I have to take ... - No, please help yourself. - Thanks. The usual box. - One more? But what if he took it the day before yesterday? - Won't you give it to me? - No, but also last week ... Is there rationing? Everyone does his own thing, are we kidding? As long as there is no pill for men ... Don't wrap it up, that's okay. - This stuff you should all use! Take into account. - That is fine. Nowadays it is criminal to have children! Do you know how many there will be in 1998? Six and a half billion! And in 2070? We will be 27 billion! What the fuck do I do? I don't shit anyway. Have you heard? Nobody thinks about the future of humanity. The situation is dramatic, but everyone is thinking about their own business. Selfishness! Here is the evil of humanity! - It's your business. - Good evening, Don Lollo. Look here, I'm forced to play the fool, ... ..to act, to buy condoms. It makes me sick to even name them! Because of you ... I have to pretend I don't want children! I am emptying my soul for a son, I who would give my blood! If you mind, then don't buy them anymore. You're right, that's enough! I throw it all away! Enough! What is this house? A condom store ?! All away! Street! - Stop, love! What are you doing? - Shut up! How disgusting! Enough with the antics! The comedy is over! But I don't want to pass for helplessness! I will tell everyone that you are sterile! Look here, a sea of ​​bullshit! (ROSALIA CRIES) Miuzza! Rosalia, don't do that! Excuse me! Do not Cry! - You know I don't want to see you cry. - Don't leave me, love! This is the tragedy. If I wanted to leave you, it would all be solved. Without you, what do I live to do? - I didn't want to come! - I tell him everything! - Do what you want. - Do you want to decide? - Go, go. We hope you don't have to regret it, my daughter. In short, doctor, the fact is that Lollo wants a child. Thing? Does your husband want a child ?! But this is great news! Why all these mysteries? You could have said it before! You finally made up your mind, huh? I decided on a horn! Lollo has always been very decisive! What do you say? Lollo has always said that he didn't want children! He still says it, but because he is ashamed! He doesn't want to make me look bad! To you? But what have you got to do with it? Do you want to make me understand? Lollo has always wanted children, right from the wedding night. And five ... These will be five twins. Now we need to find five names. Five names five! (Rosalia) (We found the five names, but we didn't know who to put them to.) (Rosalia) (time passed and the children did not come.) (Rosalia) (Lollo couldn't be right, ...) (... he always checked my belly, hips, breasts, everything.) Not even an inch more. Always the same! - What are you doing? - Turgid must be! Take this off. Here, not even a gland! Darnit! Negative. Five days late! Maybe there we are! (FLUSH NOISE) - Don't tell me that ... - Eh ... they've arrived. And they fucked me! Coward! Coward! Coward! (Rosalia) (He never gave me respite, he always thought about that.) - But, Lollo, still? - Let's start over. - Lollo, still for so much? - Don't move, please! I know, it's inconvenient, but not a drop should be wasted! His, his, his ... ferma! But why didn't you tell me before? You've been married for years! - Seven! - Did he always make you lead this life? - No, no, on the contrary. He seemed to have resigned himself, up to three months ago, ... ..when that terrible misfortune happened to Uncle Pietro. (SIREN AND CONFUSED VOICE) Make way! You can't pass! - Yes, in the ravine! - Lady, where are you going ?! You can't go! Back! - What a disgrace! - The whole Mascalucia family ended up like this, in one fell swoop! Back! You can't get off! In the dark and the rain, Marshal, we do what we can. - There are four victims. - Anyone showing signs of life? - No. Now that they are all dead, what will happen to the pasta factory? It will end up with his nephew, in Lollo! Only he is left! The uncle kept him in the pasta factory only out of pity! - Now he becomes the master! - Here is Don Lollo, he is coming! I'm sorry I made her come, but they tell me that she is the only relative. - Yes, it's the only one! - How did this happen? They skidded, went into the ravine and all four died. Four? Five! I was told '' the whole family ''. - Yes, the father and 3 children. - No! A father and 4 children, right? - Yes! - They told me 3. Permission! There is another corpse in the ravine! - Unfortunately she was right. Condolence. - Condolence. - (crying) What a misfortune! I remained alone! - Courage. And then it started again ... worse than before. '' New wealth erases wisdom. '' (crying) Now she doesn't give up anymore. He wants the heir, and I absolutely must give him this son! Doctor, please help me! That's why I'm here! Keep calm. Nowadays, sterility can be healed. Have you heard?! I can heal! And you who didn't want to take me there! - Here it is. This specialist can solve everything for you. - Thanks. He is in Catania. He is a good gynecologist, he can give you the right treatment. - You'll have to check first. - One moment! What do you have to check on my daughter ?! Where should he check it ?! Where is it? There! The ovaries, the uterus, the salpin ... No, you can't touch that! No man should touch her, only her husband! - But, mom! - It would be a disgrace! - What do you think ?! We are in 2000! Man has set foot on the moon! - Can't a doctor put his hand on the thing? - No! On what not! If God willed it sterile, God's will be done! You come! But what does this say ?! Now let's put the salpinge in the square! - Now all your beliefs are going to get screwed, huh? - Which? Those on overpopulation in 2000, on not having to have children. Now ... have you read I ? You have to do a son. Indeed, at least two! - Go to work, don't get involved. - I kiss your hands, master. - Vanni, do not take it, come on! - Hello. Pap�! He was born ... a king! (APPLAUSE) - 250.000. - No. - (Mother) 300,000. - No way. - 350! - How can you offer us such a figure! Don't you see how it suffers? (THE WOMAN CRIES) Is he still in his stomach and you want to take it away? 400,000! Done deal! We don't talk about it anymore, okay ?! Two Americans offered us half a million for the last one. We refused. Let's kiss your hands. Carmela, let's go back to the house. No, ma'am, wait a minute! Why did you make me come here ?! - Maybe I found the solution to all our problems. - What? - There is a pregnant woman there, she is expecting a child! - So? - He'd sell it to us, you know? - What should I understand?! What's the harm? They are poor, they have so many! The TV also says that Americans buy a lot of them. I remain hidden. - And then we say that he is our son? - Yes, love. - Get up! - Lollo! - Lolluzzo! - Shut up! Aren't you ashamed of what you do? - We've been interviewed. - How many children have you already sold? - Four. - Don't you suck? - Why? I'm unemployed, I can't keep them! - If you can't keep them, why are you doing them ?! - To sell them! - Get lost, otherwise I'll kill you. - UItimo price, 300,000! - OUT OF HERE! STREET! - But, Lollo, we are in their house! Ah, yeah. Then out of us. STREET! There is no justice in this world! A '' half blowjob '' like he has to do all these children ?! They come to me. Unfortunates! Cowards! You wanted to buy me a child! Have you not yet understood that I want a child of my own ?! Blood of my blood, blood of my father's blood! Wretch! I don't need to buy a child, I can do it when I want! Be careful, don't provoke me. Even if I love you, don't. The two of us are not even related, we are just husband and wife! (SOUND OF THE BAND AND SONG OF THE FAITHFUL) - Mom, then? - There it is, I spoke to her. Now it all depends on him. (SOUND OF THE BAND AND SONG OF THE FAITHFUL) - Lollo ... - Huh? - I have decided. - What? I am ready to sacrifice myself for your happiness! Do you think this is the moment ?! We'll talk about that later! Do you see the one with the black veil? The one with the book in hand. - And who is it? - She's a widow. Mom spoke to her. - He says she'd be having a baby with you. - You are crazy? - But you really would be willing ... - Anything, just to make you happy. Rosalia! - Watch out, Lollo! - Madonna! - I'll help you! - Excuse me. (SOUND OF THE BAND AND SONG OF THE FAITHFUL) (in a discordant voice) # We want God, who is our Father! # (in a discordant voice) # We want God, who is our King! # (SOUND OF THE BAND) Here, I wrote you the address. Maria Cultrera, widow of Caruso. Just give her the money. Only half, the other half after childbirth. Miuzza, what you are doing will never forget, I swear. - Go, that is waiting for you! - It goes'. But, I beg you, hurry up. What can I do? You know me. I go, do and come back. - But don't worry, my heart stays here with you. - Lollo ... Lollo, go! First you go and first you come back! You have everything? Pap�! Dad, help me! Tell me if what I'm about to do is right! Just a fuck! - Excuse me, there was a mistake! - I did it in fear! AIt! '' Corso Garibaldi 4 ''. It is here. It is allowed? Is anyone there? (THE DOG BAYS ANGRY) - Are you Signor Mascalucia? - Yes. - Please, I've been waiting for you. Please take a seat. - Something wrong? - No, everything is fine! - I saw her with the black shawl, all mysterious ... - So what? Now the mystery is gone. - Please, make yourself comfortable, I'll come right away. - Yes. I'll make you some tea. (THE CHILD DISRUPTED) Bravo, Calogero, you are done! Macch ! He's been doing me just ariette for three days! Blame the stones you eat! He is a glutton! (ROSARY CRIES) I didn't do anything to him! - I'll come right away. - I did not see it. Don't mind it, when there are children, there is always a mess. You go. You bring Rosario. (ROSARY CRIES) Chained, come and get Rosario, come on! - I'll do it immediately. - Take it easy. - Put him to bed, otherwise he'll get pissed off. Nice of mom! He has been sleeping for two years. Will he be sick? Rest in peace. - This ... is the agreed sum. - Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! When my husband's good soul was there, he fucked all the money. Otherwise they were beaten! He was a real man! '' Masculo ''! - You can get ready. - Calmly. Fuck, what a piss! Wait for me to dry. (Calogero) Mom, poop! Mom, poop! Crocifissa, put Calogero on the jar, take care of it! Done. But are you still I ? Don't you go to bed? - But, I say ... certain things in front of the children do not ... - And why? In that bed, with my husband's good soul, ... ..we had six children, not counting the rest! One thing I recommend, Don Lollo: hold me tightly, tightly! I scream, scream, fidget, bite, and, sometimes, scratch. Okay so? More intimate? My mustache! Do I have to take it all off? Or do you prefer me with culottes? I take it off, huh? - I take it off ... I take it off? - (in a choked voice) No! - But how long does it take? How many?! - The time it takes, right? - I can't resist it anymore! - Where are you going? - I'm going to meet him! - I can't wait here! - It takes an hour just to go there! I'm full of withdrawal bubbles. What is it? Don't you like me? Sure, I like him a lot, he's my type. So, let's forget it, let's not dirty everything with material acts! - But then ... - You can keep the money. - Oh, thank you, thank you! - What are you doing? - Thank you very much! (CALOGERO CRIES) Sorry. Ah, Calogero did it! - Thank you, Don Lollo! - At least he did it! (Maria) But, what a pity ... Lollo ... Lollo, what is it? Lollo, what are you doing here? What happened? Answer me, love. Have you been to the widow's? So? But how? You? With one like that, not even he could have made it. True, dad? - Rosalia, go home. - That is fine. - I'll fix dad, then I'll join you. - That is fine. - Go. - Hi. (LOLLO SIGHS) (THE PRIEST SAYS OUR FATHER IN LATIN) (PRAYERS AND PLANTS FROM THE FUNERAL COURT) Ah! But you look where they go to make holes! (THE PRIEST PRAYS IN LATIN) You filthy misery ... Ah, it is yours! I measured it! Precise! Perfect! Well done! Well done! What can you do? (THE PRIEST CLEARS HIS VOICE AND PRAYS IN LATIN) (THE PRIEST CRIES) A generous kilo of escarole for the lady. - Put it here. How much do I pay? - Only 500. - You don't fool me, do you? - Santa Rosalia is a witness! - They're fake! Don't fuck me! - Hate! - How dare you? Do you want to make her lose the baby ?! - What a fright. Excuse me. (Joyful cries of children and scolding of a nun) - The mother superior is not in the office. I'm going to look for her. - Thanks. After all, we are doing good! These single mothers are ruined! - Taking one to serve is an act of mercy! - Yes, of course! Look. Would that, for example, suit you? What questions you make? What do you mean if it's okay with me or not? I'm only here because I want a child! It doesn't matter the woman herself, I don't care ... nothing ... - That, for example, is fine! - But she's blonde! Don't stare at the hair! If only a blond son would come! - What, blond? - My grandfather was blond! A beautiful man! - We are of Norman descent, I never told you? - No. - Look how tall I am! - But you're all black! - From mother! "Mr. Mascalucia?" - YES. Sister Pasqualina told me that you are here for a girl. Take a seat. - You have many children, right? - No, we don't have them yet. - Ah ... But we would like many. We're here to find a girl to take care of it. - The girl should take care of the children. That! - Which? My wife would have chosen that. Seems right to me, as a nanny. - I really don't think he'll accept. - Why? - She's an orphan, poor thing. She followed here a Sicilian who had promised to marry her. - Then instead he seduced her and disappeared. - Well, I don't see the problem. She is embittered, sour, she had to give up her son, ... ..that we made a couple adopt. He hates Sicily and is ashamed to return to his country. Besides, she never worked as a waitress. - So ... - '' So '' what ?! Who cares? He will learn. We cannot abandon her like this, poor thing! - Here's a little gift for the convent. - Thanks! - Nothing. We need it so much! You will see, it will convince her! Please make yourselves comfortable. Everything will be fine. It is not difficult to be a waitress. You are happy? (in Veneto) I made 30, I make 31. (MUGOLll OF PLEASURE) Good morning, Marietta. (in Veneto) Good morning. Excuse me if I'm still in bed. - Forget about it. If you want, sleep some more. - It's late. - There is no hurry, rest. - Here I am! Permit? - Cover up. (LOLLO RIDE) (in veneto) Did you sleep well? Do you like latte with biscuit? - (in Venetian) Is it a joke? - No. Come on, eat it, it's good for you. You've never been on duty, have you? So you are not practical. You have to be careful with everything we do. For the first time, you better watch us to learn. (in veneto) You are running in, do you understand? - What we do to you, you will do to us. - (in Veneto) As you wish. - (in Veneto) How many spoons? - Seven, thank you! - Seven? - Yes, seven! They are enough! (LOLLO laughs) Let's do it first! (in Venetian, laughing) Here, take! And if it's bitter, call! (in veneto) If it's bitter ... call. (laughing) Take it easy! - 7 tsp! At this rate ... - Shh! Do you want to screw it up? Do we want to end this comedy? Who is this ?! After all, she is just a woman of the street, without principles, without scruples! - What are you saying?! - One who makes a child with the first that happens, what is it ?! We might as well tell her what we want right away! If there is one who wants this matter to end soon, it is me. But we must win her trust, she has already been burned. We have to be careful if we want her to be the mother of our child! - Lollo! - Miuzza! - My love! - For you I am ready for any sacrifice! - Holy you are! Santuzza! Santa! Santa! Santuzza! Santa you are! - Hello. - What a day. The accountant almost made me lose the game! - Carosello just finished. - Luckily, I thought I was late. - Good evening, Marietta. - Good evening. - Have you already eaten? No, only she had dinner. He ate his, mine and your dinner too. - He's insatiable. - Okay, make me a sandwich. - (in Veneto) Brava, Marietta, I'm really happy! - And drink! You ate it all, huh? Good! My dinner too! - (laughing) '' Your mortacci! '' - Now! - (in Veneto) I made 30, I made 31. - Give them these numbers!

Sing! - So? - In the bathroom! - What's wrong with that? And you ask me ?! Sing in the bathroom! It is serious! He cares about sugar, my dinner, he doesn't show me the games on TV! - Enough, he's pulling too hard! - So? - So ... when he pulls, he pulls. I feel that. - Lollo, what are you feeling? - I feel I have to tell him right away! - Lollo, wait! What if he gets offended? We have to take the risk. Either it goes or I break it! (MARIETTA CANTICCHIA) - (in Venetian) Good morning, sir. - Good morning! Convenient, convenient. (in veneto) At this time I feel peckish in my stomach. Truly, you always have it. However he eats, it is good to eat. Look, I should talk to you about something very important. You know that I, that is, we, my wife and I, have no children. - Lucky you. - Like? Ah, sorry, it's different for you. But you will understand that, for a couple, not having one is a sad result. Unhappy. Sad. (crying) The house ... remains empty. Life ... has no purpose anymore. (crying) The house ... is joyless ... without ... without ... (crying) The house is sad! Without joy! Without heat! - Hey, are you listening to me ?! - Yes. Do you know what we have decided, my wife and I? Do you know what we said? - (in Veneto) Done 30, let's do 31. - Here, let's do 31. Brava. Since children do not come and without it we do not want to stay ... ..this is why ... we chose you. To change our destiny and fill this void, this house. You understand? (MARIETTA CRIES) What the hell are you doing? You spit in my face! But you must be crazy! Cry, spit, eat! Look ... now don't do that. I understand the surprise, you did not expect it. But there is no need to cry! - Among so many girls, why did you choose me? - You seemed the most suitable.

He was laughing and crying, he hugged me saying '' mom ''. What did you tell her? I spoke to her with my heart in my hand! I told her we want a child and she kept eating! It does not understand, indeed, it is equivocal! She is convinced that we want to adopt it! She who is already a mother! Crazy stuff! So I become a grandfather! Then there was a misunderstanding, you explained yourself badly. But how, do you defend it as well? Now you are happy! It was on your stomach that I lay down with her! - You always put malice in the matter! - But what malice? You always thought that I was happy, that I liked that I ! And not that it was just a simple formality! - You know what? Now you take it and explain everything to her. - it ?! - Exactly. Just you. So, when I come back, you make me find her in bed already ready. - Because I want this son! - How can I do? - I do not care! - (Vanni) No! - What happens? - (in Venetian) Unfortunate! I'll cut it off! - Are you crazy?! - What happens? - Stop! - Why do you have scissors ?! - I'll cut it! - What did you do to her ?! - I asked her for a coffee. - While I was preparing it, he touched my ass! An affectionate gesture, to break the ice. If anyone touches me, I'll cut it off! I did 30, I do 31! - Good! - What are you saying? Is there a tragedy now for a little touch? - A little moderation! - Like? Do you speak like that? He told me about the family, about the empty house, that he had chosen me ... Enough! Take her away! (in veneto) I'll take care of him! Did you touch her whole ass? I swear to you, I just touched it! And she just wanted to cut you for this ... the '' woodpecker '' ?! - It could happen to you too! - What a great whore! - Hello, darling, good job! - Come back soon! Hi, dad! - Did he call you 'dad'? - Hurry up, we're late! - Can you know why he called you '' dad ''? - Because she is Venetian! - What does that have to do with anything?! - In Veneto the '' master '' is called '' dad ''! It is like the '' pater familia '', the boss. It's right. Is the Pope your father? - No, God forbid! - Yet it is called '' Holy Father ''. It's a way of saying. Also, don't piss off and drive!

Feel that it stinks! Homemade! - Actually I ... - Heaven sends you! - Blessed be! Rosalia, make her sit down! She can solve everything, don't you understand? - What are you saying? - She found herself in the same situation as Marietta! She was immediately willing, therefore she is the most suitable to convince that I! - What do I have to convince? - Don't worry, I'll explain everything! - Is it a long thing? - No! (LAUGHS) Stopped! Stop! I make a hundred children! I do a hundred! - One hundred ... one hundred! - Wake up, we are about to arrive in Catania!

And that that money could be used to recover ... her creature! How happy she would have been and you too! What more did he want ?! (NOISE OF DOOR CLOSING) It's Rosalia. We hope he found it. - Rosalia! - Disappearance. I've looked for it everywhere, but it can't be found. - Let's hope he doesn't do nonsense. - What are you saying? You stay, right? Sure, how could I leave you alone? I also told her to stay. Is it true that she stays? Surely. Just eat it. Not bad. Too bad I'm wasted here. My poor Peppino, who left me in the midst of temptations! Oh... (NOISE OF FALLING GLASS) (TON) (TON) (softly) The scissors ... This isn't joking. Ah, there they are. (NOISE OF BOTTLE FALLING) Always eat! - Pss, pss, Marietta! - Chi �? Shut up, not a word more, let me speak. I'm here to ask you a favor. Then ... act as you see fit. I know what I'm about to say may hurt you, but it is necessary! There was a big misunderstanding between the two of us! You are young ... beautiful ... desirable ... But I too am still young, strong, full of life, of ardor! When I chose you, I wanted to fill a joyless life, that's true. But above all because I liked you! And not as a daughter, but as a woman! A true, complete woman, capable of giving me what Rosalia cannot! To give me this son, to make me a father like all men! No! Stop! Stop ... I'm afraid of your answer. Before speaking, think about it, I beg you. (MARIA GEME) What do these groans mean? Don't tell me all my hopes, my wishes are coming true? (MARIA GEME) Thanks! I knew you would understand! I make you a monument! More in I . Ah, the jacket. Give me a child and I'll give you everything you want! Ah! Marietta, how dry you are! What are you doing? Do you eat, eat and lose weight? - Don't you have the lone worm? - Don Lollo, take me! - Who are you? - I am perdition! - Leave my hair! I get up from myself. What happened to Marietta? What are you doing here ?! Calm down, Don Lollo, now I'll explain. I had come to bring you a form of pecorino out of gratitude ... Thank you very much, but what does Marietta have to do with it? As the weather was bad, his wife let me stay here. - The bed was free. - And where is Marietta? - Thinking I'm his daughter, that poor thing ... - I understand everything. He no longer wants to sleep in the servant's bed, he wants to sleep with his mother! He got his head! Now I'll show her! - Wait, what are you doing? - Do your own thing and go to bed. A kennel. My wife ... she absolutely must not know I'm here! - Keep her at any cost! - Why? - Do your own thing! - Definitely! Shh... Marietta! Marietta! Shut up, don't talk! I go under! - Did you hear that noise too? - I heard nothing. - I think it comes from there. - I have to keep it. - Why? - We don't know. - (Mother) Help! Help! Shut up, don't screw me up! - Lollo, are you crazy? - I want a son! - With mom? - With mom! My Madonna! Where's Marietta? Where did you hide it ?! - You told her to tell her the truth and she became a beast. - He went away. - He ran away. - And where did he go? - Dunno. (DOORBELL) (DOORBELL) - Marietta! - Heaven be praised, you're back! - Around at night! I have thought about it, I accept. I do it for the money, to get my son back. But ... are you really decided? - Yes, by now I have done 30 ... - And now it is 31. It always goes 31, after having done 30. (LOLLO CANTICCHES NERVOUSLY) (LOLLO CANTICCHES NERVOUSLY) The handkerchief. # I have a handkerchief, and I'm putting it on ... # You made yourself beautiful. Presentable. You know how strange that is. For a matter of education. - Even the perfume you wore. - Of course, that stinks! - For me this is like a surgical operation! - Yes, dressed like that! Did I have to wear a gown and a mask? - You said it too: the sooner this story ends, the better. - It is true. - Go ahead ... - Miuzza! - Opera! - Miuz ... A hair. Luckily I noticed. (THE MOTHER AND THE WIDOW RECITE PRAYERS WITH FERVOR) Come on. (THE MOTHER AND THE WIDOW RECITE PRAYERS WITH FERVOR) (LOLLO laughs nervously) Here we are. - Repent? - No. Rather, did he wash himself? - Like? - I'm a little squeamish. How should I wear? These are not things that can be programmed. They come spontaneously. However, a minimum of heat would be needed. Mind you, I don't want to have fun like crazy. - But a minimum ... of collaboration! - He's right. Come on, take a seat. So how should I put on? Downhill, possibly. (LOLLO RIDE) Marietta! Marietta! How long did it take! (ROSALIA GEME) How hot you are! Give me a son, finally make me a father! (ROSALIA GEME) Well! You see it? You feel pleasure too! I told you it comes spontaneously! (ROSALIA GEME) Yes! Groan, Marietta! Yell out! Do not be afraid! (in Veneto) I don't moan with pleasure and I don't scream. I just shut up. - So who is it? - (in Veneto) It comes from I . Perhaps it is the lady, poor thing. Rosalia? Oh my God! (ROSALIA CRIES) (THE MOTHER AND THE WIDOW RECITE PRAYERS WITH FERVOR) (ROSALIA CRIES) It's nothing, we can start over. - But doesn't the lady cry? - No, on the contrary, he laughs! I destroy you! (ROSALIA CRIES) Don't feel, it's just the two of us! (ROSALIA CRIES) Come on, what are you doing? Come away. Let her work in peace, soon everything will be over. Be quiet and come away. The more it concentrates, the sooner it ends. (ROSALIA CRIES) Don't worry, we're alone! Alone! It seems to be at a funeral! Disgust! You disgust me! You have a wife who adores you, a saint! Now suffering the pains of hell, and you are in bed with another ?! (LOLLO SPITS) You bastard! Only a bastard like you could do that! (crying) You make me sick! (LOLLO SPITS) I came to get a tranquilizer for Rosalia. He feels bad. Leave it alone. I'll take care of Rosalia. God ... Lollo ... Lollo? - Have you seen Lollo? - Wasn't he in bed with you? - When I woke up, the bed was empty! - Oh, my Madonna! (Maria) What was it? - It's his! - Of him! (Lollo) ('' Only love of my life, ... '') ('' ... my hand is shaking as I have to say 'goodbye'. '') - Rosalia! My baby! - Miserable! Horned ! - Is it serious? - The shock was strong. - Then, on a person so exhausted ... - Holy Virgin! (Doctor) Now pray, but you should have thought about it first, ... .. maybe you could fix everything with a little gynecological therapy. - So she lost her husband too! - Lollo didn't run away! - No? Just long enough to have a child with Marietta is gone! - With Marietta? - Yes, then come back. - But he said 'goodbye forever'! There was a misunderstanding, Lollo wrote: ... .. '' I say 'goodbye', but only for a few days, ... '' '' ... time to have a baby and I'll be right back. '' - What a gentleman! - And what nobility of soul! '' I could not have had a child under the marital roof, ... '' '' ..I would have disgusted myself, I would have spit in my face ''. - What an exaggeration! - No, no, that really spits! Okay, but do you think you're hiding everything from people? To everyone? When the son arrives, we say that it is Rosalia's and everything is fine. - Glad you ... I greet you. - Hello, doctor. You will see that everything falls into place. Think about getting well, mama's sweetheart. - Don Lollo wrote! - That says? - Let's go hear! '' Therefore, during my absence ... '' '' ..I invite you to continue the work with confidence and serenity. '' '' The purpose of my mission is the search for new markets ... '' '' ... in the continent and abroad, ... '' '' ..to ensure the continuity and development of our company. '' (Vanni) '' Affectionately yours, Mascalucia Lollo. '' (LOLLO ANSIMA) This too is done. How many are they? - Five. - Enough for now. Better not to engulf. I AM FATHER! FATHER LIKE MY FATHER! Go fuck yourself and that horny father of yours! You can no longer sleep! - Maybe it is better to do another one. - Still? - For security. Ugh ... Don't move, stop! Not a drop should be wasted! # The woman is mobile ... like a feather in the wind ... # (Lollo) ('' Don't worry if someone is chatting in the village.) ('' Think of the day when he returns victorious with a son, ... '') (''..our son!'') (`` Yours is a great sacrifice, but I too sacrifice a lot. '') ('' Even five times a day. '') Ah ... what a magnificence, huh? What silence, what solitude! Yes, this peace moves me. - Here it must look great! Come on, lie down! - Also here? - Why not? Come on! - You took me for a coin machine! - One comes to get a little distracted ... - What do you care, lie down! (in Veneto) Yes, yes, we did 30, we do 31. Maybe you're right, a little distraction will do us good! - (laughing) We did 68, we do ... - What? - No, I say: we did 68 ... - So what? - How do you always say? - (in Veneto) We did 30, we do 31. - Yes. Now I say: we did 68, we do ... - 31! Okay, let's do 31, worse for you. Macch , nothing ... Nothing, do you understand ?! Nothing! You have lost weight too, fuck you! - No improvement? - (crying) No, always like that. (Lollo) ('' Dear Rosalia, nothing, still nothing. '') ('' I'm disheartened. '') (`` If Marietta hadn't already had a child, I would think she is barren. '') ('' With your image always in mind, I continue in this effort. '') ('' Without it, I would have planted everything already. But we have to do it. '') He does it on purpose, this great whore. Rosalia, what are you saying? Doctor, have you heard? Thank god! Start reacting! Here you are, not a day late. Precise! Are you a Swiss watch ?! Could it be that you are too impetuous, too fast and hasty? The time you had the child, how many times did you make love? - One. - Eh ... one ?! - Yes, one. - (in Veneto) But it lasted almost two hours. - Are you sure? - Yes. - (Lollo) Porcaccia the dirty misery ... - (Marietta) What are you saying? (Lollo) I always say prayers, before sleeping. (Coach) Get away with that ball! Pass it, don't get attached to it! Give it to Parodi! Here it is! Come on, grit!

Now silence and maximum concentration. (recorder) Relax. You feel tired, but you are calm, relaxed. (recorder) Controlling the nerves gives you dominion over your body.

I already don't feel like it, so, then! You did not understand anything! I had the sports doctor explain everything. So I regain control of my senses. It is called '' psychotherapy ''. - Yes, but ... - You have to stay still, understand ?! Didn't you say your son did it with a single two-hour blow? With this system, I make it last 3, 4 hours! Just don't interrupt me. Now the son we will definitely do it! - (recorder) Don't be tense. - No. - (recorder) Don't be in a hurry. - No. (recorder) Take it easy ... slow down ... relax ... relax ... (recorder) What ... softly ... softly ... (recorder) Stop! You don't have to move! You have to stay still! (recorder) Think of the sea, an expanse of blue, infinite sea. (recorder) There is a small island full of greenery ... (recorder) Don't get distracted! (recorder) Focus on this vision of peace, of stillness. (recorder) Now you can start over.

(recorder) Now you can release all the stored energy! (recorder) Yes, go! Go! (LOLLO RUSSA) (in veneto) Go to that town, you and psychotherapy! I'm sick! - How many have I done? - What do you want to do? You have been tormenting me for months! I gave you a lot of money! I cannot '' ciavar '' all my life because you gave me the money! What do you think, that I am having a great time? I'm fed up too, understand ?! But you look at this! You know what I say? I give you the last chance. If you can't give me a child, they don't talk about it anymore, and friends as before. But what proof! You can do a hundred or a thousand, so nothing will happen! What do you mean?! Have you ever thought that I am not sterile, it is not your wife but you ?! Did it ever occur to you ?! Then think about it! Before moving on to the various exams, ... ..biopsy of the rete testis, of the Sertoli cells, ... ... of the cervical canal, and those to determine the Ph, ... ..I think it will be better to examine the semen. - The seed? - Yes. (NOISE OF DOOR OPENING) Miss. - Have the gentleman sit down. - This way. - Go. You have to collect it in this tube. Take your time. - Miss? - Yes? - Done. - As did''? - Done. Mh... Mh... - I'm sorry to say, but ... - Sterile. C'mon. I know the news is serious, sad. But believe me, I'm not telling him to console him, ... ... today, giving birth to a child is an equally serious problem. With the future that prepares us ... But do you know how many there will be, in 2070 ?! Try to say it, come on! How many will we be in 2070 ?! 27 billion, I know! Does he come to say it to me ?! Coward! Horned! SHE IS A HORN! CORNUTAZZO! I had heard calls. (CONFUSED CRY) I knew it! The fault is yours! (CONFUSED SCREAM) You close! ''Vade Retro''! (THE PRIEST laughs) - Via! - Via! - Pussa via! (CONFUSED SCREAM) Rosalia! Love! (CONFUSED SCREAM) Sterile! And cuckold! (CONFUSED SCREAM) (THOUGHT SOUND) (THOUGHT SOUND) Pap�... (Rosalia) Lollo? Lolluzzo! How are you, honey? Vanni is already there. He brought some papers to sign. Do I get it up? No. Don't worry, you can sign them at your convenience. Now drink the milk, which, as the doctor told you, is good for you. Come on, love, take a sip. Come on, Lolluzzo! You take it by yourself. That is fine. Hello sweetheart. (TOWARDS OF SURPRISE) Hello! (GEMITI) (70's MUSIC) But, Lollo, my love, don't do that. Come on, react a little bit, right? We must not be disheartened like this. Come on, come on! Besides, nobody in town knows that you are sterile. For people you are as before. Everyone thinks I'm barren. - Poor Rosalia ... - Don't worry about me, I'm used to it. Besides, it doesn't matter. But you can't reduce yourself like this, we don't solve anything. And what do you want to solve? At this point... You have reduced yourself like this because you want a child, right? We can always have this child, you just need to want it. You sacrificed yourself so much to have our son. Even 5 times a day, remember? After what you did, now it is right for me to sacrifice myself. - Rosalia ... - Yes? - What the fuck are you saying ?! I want to give you a son. To get it, there is only one chance left. - But no! - Eh ... - Relax! I will be just a tool. You will remain indifferent, without feeling. It will be ... like a surgical operation. - And who is this surgeon? - Any one. One who will only know once and who will then no longer have to exist. - We kill him? - What are you saying, love? You will never know him! Don't do that, love! Think about when there will be a baby at home! A son of ours who will call you '' dad ''! Dad! Dad! (VACATION OF A CHILD) It's a boy! (MANIFESTATIONS OF JOY) Heartfelt congratulations! What did I tell you, Lollo? You have to have faith! Sooner or later, the Lord puts his hand in it! Yes, yes, a hand ... a hand takes.
