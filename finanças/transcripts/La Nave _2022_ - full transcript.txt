Fuck! Hey! And that's all with today's topic here at the Ship, boys and girls: Diet. And today's message is: "Remember to eat well to grow up healthy and strong." Well, I imagine most of you, lazy bastards, are probably out of school and learned absolutely nothing. So that's all for today. Stay tuned tomorrow, at the same time, to travel again on The Ship, where the best fuel is your imagination. Here... on Popuradio. Oh, yeah! I almost forgot. Give us a call to 5-138-686. Why? I don't know. But please do call! If you wish for anything, no matter how hard it seems, here's The Ship to listen and give you the runaround. Bye! Miguel. - The Ship... - Miguel... What? Everything okay, buddy? Mike, they'll cancel you if you keep calling them lazy bastards. What's wrong with you? Wait, dude! What's wrong? Don't mind what I said, Pato. No one listens to us, anyway. Fuck! It's wet! What's the matter? No, what's the matter with you? DO NOT BREAK Feeling better today, buddy? The mug. What's wrong with the mug? I don't even drink coffee. You can drink something else. - I don't like to drink from a mug. - What's the difference? When you drink water from a mug, it doesn't taste like water, it tastes like... Mug. - That's for sure. - Daisy... Shut up. Why is the mug identical to the one I broke yesterday? The company has plenty of boxes filled with identical mugs. Why do we need so many mugs? I don't know, dude, they're kinda neat. I think people like them. I didn't ask for another mug. Don't worry, Mike. It's part of my job. - Really? - Yes. What is this guy doing? So we're not feeling better today? Give it up for these... Christian! If you say anything like what you said yesterday, I don't care how many people listen to us, you're out. I'm serious. What you said wasn't funny. We've got a mess on social media because of you. How much of an impact can my words have? People react when provoked. - Really? - Yes. 'Cause it seems they're all dead out there. Mike, we all have our bad days every now and then. They're quite common in my case. I'm gonna ask you to be extremely polite today. But to be honest, I'm not asking you. So remember: In case of a health emergency, such as dengue, contact your doctor immediately. Let's take a break, and we'll be right back. The Ship... The Ship... We'll be back. Mazel tov! Popuradio, good afternoon. Miguel, we're on the air in fifteen seconds. Pato! Oh! We have a call. Please, behave. The Ship... The Ship... The Ship... And welcome back to The Ship by Popuradio, my friends. We have the first call of the day. Hello! How's it going? Hello. - What's your name? - Gerardo. Gerardo! Thanks for calling The Ship. I'm Miguel. How old are you? Seven. Almost eight. Almost eight! Lucky you! What can we do for you? I've never been to the sea. And I've never been to the Great Wall, Gerardo, but that's life. Can you take me? - Where? - To the sea. Can you take me in your ship to the sea? We're not a travel agency. We give away T-shirts and mugs, but only to the good kids. How are your grades? I don't go to school. Oh! Not only is the boy a beggar and a chooser but also lazy. Why don't you go to school? I'm at Morelia's hospital. Why? What happened? Did you catch the clap? You find it everywhere. No. It's cancer. Hello? Are you still there? Yes. Yes, Gerardo. I'm here. What's up? You're The Ship's captain. I wanna know if you can take me to the sea. To an abandoned island, to fish, to see the fish with my diving mask, roast marshmallows and build a campfire. You said no matter how hard it seems, The Ship can do it. The show's called The Ship, yes, but... How do I explain it? Can you take me in your ship to visit the sea and do the rest? I listen to your show every day, and I wanna meet you but... - I can't get out of here. - Umm... Don't worry. When you get well, and I'm sure that'll be really soon, you can come and visit The Ship. I don't know how long I'll be here. Like here "here," you know? Why don't you come and visit me? I'm not at... I'm not at... But yeah. Yeah, of course. And then, you'll take me to the sea? To visit the sea? Gerardo... The Ship... It's broken. It's in the shop. Promise you'll come and visit me? I promise. How about that, my dear listeners? That's all for today here at The Ship. That wasn't so hard, wasn't it? What was I gonna say to a kid with cancer? First, you can explain what's the clap. The clap? You don't have to say anything. Go, you laugh at his jokes, take a photo, and leave. What if it's contagious? - It's not contagious. - Unlike the clap. That's for sure. Don't be an asshole. Where does it say in my two-dollar contract that I have to do this? It doesn't. It's called an executive decision. Why did you put him through? Oh! From now on, please ask them if they have cancer before putting a call through. - Cancer? - Or anything else for that matter. What makes you think I'm negotiating? Go or be gone. I don't have a car. I'll produce one for you. I'm no good with sick people. I never know what to tell them. I see them all weak and I start feeling weak myself... I have the same thing with people that stutter. Just by being next to one, my ideas start to stutter as well. You won't be able to meet my grandma then. Four minutes. - Brush your hair. - It's true. It's awful. Once I talked to one on the bus. Shit, I couldn't speak for three days straight. Three and half minutes! CHILDREN'S ONCOLOGY HOSPITAL I think he should be there by now. His name is Felipe. He'll give you some boxes... Good afternoon. I'm here to visit a patient, - a kid called Gerardo... - Hold on a second. - Gerardo... - Miguel? - Miguel Lopez, right? - Yes. Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Sandra, Gerardo's Mom. - Nice to meet you. - Thanks for coming. No, no. It's nothing. But I can only be here for a moment. I have a very busy day. Don't worry. The Purepecha say that when you dream of a kitten licking your face it's because you're about to get a visit. This way. A kitten...? Gerardo Janitzio, get down from there, sweetheart. Look who's here, sweetie! - Captain? - Hi, Gerardo. Where's the captain? It's me, Miguel. You're the captain? Yes. I'm... Miguel. Where's your uniform? My what? Your uniform. You know, if you're a captain, you've got to have at least a suit and a pilot helmet. Sure... It's at the dry-cleaner. Why? I was eating a pizza and it got a stain of... You broke your ship and you stained your uniform? It's been a rough week. That's nothing! They told me I'm gonna die. I also like pizza a lot, it's my favorite food. And avocado, but I'm allergic to it. And how do you feel? Good. Sometimes I throw up green. When can we take your ship to the sea? He's always been fascinated by the sea but for various reasons, we haven't been able to go... My mom said I could call you if I ate all the vulture stew, and I ate it all. Vulture stew? They say they're scavnei... Scavengers, love. - Scavengers. And they produce anta... - Antibodies. Antibodies that are good for when you're sick. So they say. So they say. Well, honey, get down to take a photo with Miguel. One, two... - Very good! - Another one! Okay, another one. Gerardo! Cover yourself! - Well... - I'm sorry. It was very nice to meet you, Gerardo. How are you, Gerardo? Good. I'm gonna take your mom outside to chat for a bit, okay? - Okay. - Would you come with me, please? Thank you very much, Miguel! Really, thank you very much! Look, Ramiro, this is Miguel. The Ship's captain. He didn't bring his captain's suit because he got pizza stains on it. Hm! What a fool. - Hi, Ramiro. - Hi. So when are you coming back? Well... Once the Ship is repaired, we'll have to check if it works then. Hm! You'll never get to the sea. Well, see you later. Where's my hug? Well then... Nice to meet you all. Bye. We thought that by removing Gerardo's tumor plus the radiation and chemotherapy, we'd have everything under control, but... Now we've seen that the disease has spread to the bones, liver, and colon. It's metastasis. What do I do? For now, we're gonna continue with the chemo. However, we'll have to increase the radiations' frequency and unfortunately, that's more expensive. Listen, ma'am, between you and me. There's another treatment... Alternative. Hormonal. I can sell it to you unofficially, if you'd like. For a better price, obviously. I imagine you wanna try everything, so... Well, it's your decision. It's your son's life. So... Think about it. Good evening. Now you see why I didn't wanna go? How can I help? However you want. Just leave me out of it. Follow me. - What? - Come, come, come! Come! So what's your plan? My plan is not to go back to the hospital and get out of the way. That's cold! After the picture and the hug? Please! You're just using this as a publicity stunt. You only wanna seize the opportunity to lure audiences. Your show's rating is hitting rock bottom. You're about the get fired, and your attitude isn't helping. I wanna help the kid. And believe it or not, I wanna help you too. Then why doesn't the radio station pay for it? Impossible. It's just an all-inclusive trip to any beach. Well, not any beach. He said an abandoned island. And the campfire, the hotdogs, the camp itself... Don't help me, dumb-ass! It can take years for the company to authorize a donation. We'll explain the situation to accelerate the process. They'll be heroes to the public. No. 'Cause if anything happens to the kid during the trip, they'll be responsible. That's right. We might need an insurance to avoid lawsuits. A sponsorship! In exchange for publicity. No one wants to be advertised in your show. Which part of boat-abandoned- island-campfire-marshmallows didn't you understand? Oh! And insurance. One minute before being on the air. Oh! Great time! Those 42K will know what I'm made of. Have you thought what you're gonna do to help the kid? Uh... Don't sweat it. I thought about it for you. You sign up for the marathon. You announce on the show that you'll run for the kid and that you're just looking for sponsors to pay for the trip to fulfill the kid's dream. You're crazy. You don't have to win. You just have to get to the finish line. It's genius! Yeah, genius, after running only 42K! Are you fucking with me? - Run or be ruined. - Five seconds to be on the air. - Four, three, two... - The Ship... The Ship. Welcome to The Ship, my friends! Today we'll talk about... About... Today I'm gonna talk to you about a warrior named Gerardo. Buddy, if you're listening, a big hug out to you. As it turns out, Gerardo's in the hospital, and he's asking us to help him fulfill his dream. To travel inside The Ship and go to the sea and... some other nuances. Unfortunately, my ship's a ramshackle. So I propose to you the following: I hereby publicly announce that I'll participate at the Michoacan International Marathon so that we can collect money to take Gerardo and his mom in The Ship to a virgin island... Sorry, to an abandoned island, so that he can swim... And maybe... Build a campsite. And... a campfire! Just like Robinson Crusoe, but with a ticket back home. - Popuradio! Good afternoon... - In exchange for a donation, Sure, just a second. I'll wear whatever you want on the race. Who's this? Captain! It's me, Gerardo! Hi, buddy! What's up? How long is forty-two kilometers? It's a lot! Have you run forty-two kilometers before? The truth is I haven't. What's the longest you've run? Eight? Oh! I'll never go to the sea. Gerardo, I don't know how I'm gonna do it... But I will run the forty-two kilometers. Okay. Bye. The ads! There you go! You guys sponsor, I run, and Gerardo gets to visit the sea. And now, a message from the few advertisers that haven't left us yet. Captain! You've got your first sponsor: "La Surtidora" restaurant. Excuse me, you know where's Leo? Leo! Leo. Sorry to bother you, but I'd like to know if you can help me train... - I've a... - Who told you to stop? Can I help you? - I'm here to ask Leo if he can help... - I'm Leo. - You're Leo? - Yes. Leo. Abbreviation of Leonora. How can I help you? So, can you train me for the Michoacan Marathon? In one month? Do not stop! Do you run? Meh. - What's your name? - Miguel. Miguel, forget it. But don't worry. Why don't you train properly and participate in the next one in six months? I can't. If I finish it they'll give me money to take a boy with cancer to the sea. With his mom. I don't think he can go alone. What type of cancer does he have? It's spread everywhere. You know how hard it is to train for a marathon, right? I know. Faster! But something tells me you're the right person for the job. I always accomplish my goals. I believe you. We start tomorrow. Leave him your number. Which part of 5:30 didn't you understand? Do up your hair. Let's go! Wait! Are you for real? How much have we run? Not even 2K! It burns inside. Ah! You sure you wanna go through with this? Of course. You're sure? I'm gonna ask one thing from you: Don't waste my time. The only way you'll be able to run that marathon is by falling apart and building yourself up again, as many times as necessary. There are no miracles. Jesus won't come down to push you through that finish line. Is that clear? Good thing I don't believe in that stuff. Come on. Let's go. Don't waste my time. And think of every step as a new opportunity. Come on, come on. You gonna cry? I can't. I don't know what I was thinking. I want a settlement. What are you talking about? You wanna help the kid? You run, then. But you promised to do so. The whole state heard you! And it's neighbors. - And the kid! - His name's Gerardo. Okay. So go and tell the kid, Gerardo, face to face, that you're a jerk and you won't make his dream come true. Offer a public apology over the radio. And get yourself a lawyer. 'Cause you won't have any settlement. Good thing my brother's a lawyer. I'm really sorry. But I don't see how I can train myself in less than a month. Mike... I understand. Mike... Mike... Take this. To remember me. I told you I accomplish my goals. Let's go! Get the fuck on it! Mike! - Look! We all pitched in. - It was my idea! They didn't have any other color? - Mike... Shut up. - Shut up. Okay, that's it. That's it. What the hell? "I'll wear anything you want on the day of the race." Come on! We didn't buy your outfit for you to lie down. Damn nasty kids! Welcome, my friends, to the marathon, here at Popuradio! No, no, no. Remember, your back needs to be straight. You don't wanna hurt yourself. At Popuradio! Very good! What's wrong, honey? You fell for it, silly face! Hey! Like this. Pah! Okay? Look! For the day of the race. See you at the finish line. See you at the finish line. Jumping jacks! Eat. Okay. What's going on here? How are you doing? Good... Not so good. Water... Please, water. - Please... - Jumping jacks! He got really scared when he saw those huge mountains covered in snow. Suddenly a bear came out of nowhere, and he made it angry and provoked it and "Rah!" Four! What's this for? To cool you down! Five! What's going on here? Three! Four! Hard! Don't cry. Why are you doing this for Gerardo? It's what anyone would do, right? Is that all? Do I need another reason? Why are you doing this? It's what anyone would do, right? No. Anyone would charge me for training me. You do it because you love to boss around. Or is it because you really believe in me? This isn't about believing. I'm gonna train you to pull this off, and if you don't, I'll beat the shit out of you. Come in. Sorry for all the mess around the house. It's just that I'm rearranging some old furniture that has been here for years. Then I've been remodeling and painting... And you know how it is. Besides, people... say they're gonna help you and... And they don't help at all. I've been painting the walls myself. Then between... my job, Gerardo... You know. My boss isn't the most... Do you like mezcal? Everybody likes mezcal. You can play some music in... That's my reading couch sometimes. Not always. But I'll bring a cloth to dust off the room because... Old houses, you know? They keep the... The... Come on, Miguel. Come on, come on. Ready! And that thing going through your head right now is not very convenient when you're training for a marathon. Cheers! What are you eating? Are you eating well? How much money we have so far? A third. You have to get to the finish line, little fucker. Of course I will. Remember to take pictures with Gerardo and uploading them. Why? 'Cause we're gonna make a lot of noise. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter... People are gonna say, "Ah! There's hope for humanity." Emoji, emoji, emoji. "A radio host from Popuradio is going to run the marathon to grant a kid's last wish." Let me hear you! #42K. - Good. What else? - #PopuRun. I love it. #Hero And I'm gonna be at the finish line waiting for you 'cause obviously I'm gonna get there first, and when you finally get there, you're gonna hug me and the reporters will take pictures of us, and with tearful eyes, you're gonna say "Thank you, God!" I don't believe in God. I don't care what you believe in. People want sentimentalism. The owners of this company want you to say and do what people expect. You know what Voltaire said? I suppose Voltaire said many things. Don't be an idiot! What did Voltaire say about running marathons? About God! What did he say? "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Him." We're gonna make an uproar around all this 'cause it's good for everybody. I don't think Voltaire would use the word "uproar." I'm late! The Ship comes to you! What happened? Ramiro, his buddy, died. And with Gerardo, there's nothing left to do. I'm sure they made a mistake. You look really good. Look... I'm gonna call the shop to see if they can have - The Ship ready earlier... - I don't wanna go anymore. - Why? - 'Cause I don't wanna go anymore. Sweetie, Miguel's doing everything for us to go to the beach. You really wanted to go. Not anymore. But you're gonna love it. Playing in the sand, in the waves... Traveling in The Ship. I'm sure everything's gonna be better when we get back. How do you know? Because... Because... I also had cancer, and here I am. I don't believe you. Yeah! Believe me! I have a huge scar. I can't pull down my pants here, but... I don't believe you. - Why not? - Because you only tell lies. You don't even have a captain's ship. Sweetie, he told you, it's in the shop. Leave. To remember me. Miguel? Miguel, are you there? It's 6 a.m. Miguel! Are you angry? Sweetie, I understand that you're angry. I'm angry too. And really sad. But it's nobody's fault that you're sick. It's just... fucking nature. But look, sweetie, I can assure you... Leave me alone, Mom. Please. What are you doing? - How did you come in? - Your neighbor. Don't think it's day off 'cause it's Sunday! Why didn't you answer in the morning? - We won't make it. Forget it. - What? He's very sick. He won't make it. What happened? The kid won't go to the sea, he won't be the only one. The sea's very dangerous. We return the money and everyone goes back to being miserable. No, no. We must keep training. Are you deaf? It's pointless! I know how difficult it can be... What the fuck do you know? Why are you giving up? I'm not giving up! There's simply nothing left to do! Leave, please. I don't know what the fuck's up with you, but you have to talk to someone. Leo... Stop bothering me. Perfect. Keep playing victim. You have a degree, a job, this house... You're nothing but a fucking coward. Coward? Victim? What do you know? Yeah, you already said that! Fuck! They told me so! Do not go by yourself. But no... We had to go camping to a fucking beach in the middle of nowhere. My feet stopped touching the bottom. Waves started hitting me. I couldn't come out to cry for help. One after the other. Wave after wave. Suddenly my dad's arms surrounded me... And pushed me to the next wave to wash me out. To breathe! Then I realized I was next to my mom. We got hit by even more waves until we could touch the bottom again and come out crawling all the way to the sand. We turned around and... Obviously my dad did not come out. My mom died last year. But she was practically mute after that incident. That's why I inherited this fucking house. I'm sorry. And now that I wanna help, it's too late. Who says that? Science. Sometimes the will can give blows to science. Tell that to Gerardo. He barely speaks. He doesn't care about the sea anymore. Not even The Ship. No matter how hard I tried to convince him. Let me talk to him. You think you're the only one with a waste of a degree? What did you say to him? That I had cancer, like him, and I'm fine, everything's fine. Is it true? Well, they removed a little mole from my butt. Fuck off, Miguel. Let's go! Sweetie... I want you to meet Leonora. She's Miguel's friend. Hello! Your name is Gerardo, right? Gerardo Janitzio. And how do you feel, Gerardo Janitzio? Good. Do you want to talk with me for a moment? Talk about what? Well, they told me you're a very smart kid so I'm not gonna beat around the bush. I'm a psychologist. Why do I need a psychologist? No. You don't need a psychologist. But we all feel good to talk about our feelings with somebody who studied that. Talking. Aren't psychologists for crazy people? Who told you that? I listened to my mom, when she argued with my grandpa, she used to say, "You're crazy. You need a psychologist." Well, do you mind if I stay for a while to talk to you alone? No. Well, sweetie, I'm gonna be outside, okay? Come on, let's go. After we talk, are you gonna tell everything to my mom? No, of course not. I swear. They say I'm going to die. Did they tell you that? Yes, they've told me so. That's why I'm here. Because... when they tell you stuff like that, I can help say goodbye to their families. Because it's not easy. Tell me, are you angry? No. It's fucking nature's fault. Then why have you been so quiet lately? My mom thinks I'm angry because I don't talk to her. But... I don't know what to tell her. She's sad and worried, and that's why I tell her I feel good. And how do you really feel? Good. Sometimes my body hurts. Sometimes it does. Sometimes it doesn't. You're very brave. You know that? Mike felt the same when he had cancer? - Miguel Ramon? - Yes. Mmh... - And are you sad? - No. - Worried? - No. You know that if you don't talk to your mom, she gets sad, right? But what do I say? Well... - Do you love her? - Yes. Well, tell her that. - You want her to always be happy? - Yes. Well, tell her that too! Right? What do you think happens when someone dies? I don't know anyone who's come back to tell the tale, so I don't know. And you? No, me neither. Is dying good or bad? It's neither good nor bad. It's fucking nature's fault, right? - Do you know what Mazatec is? - No. Well, Mazatec is a language, like Spanish. Just like you and I speak Spanish, some people speak Mazatec or Purepecha, you've heard of that one. Do you know how to say "star" in Mazatec? No. "Niño" as in boy in Spanish. You're a boy who's gonna turn into a star. I think it's really nice to turn into a star, don't you think? Yes. So, you'll be able to look after your mom and... She'll always know you're there, and she'll be able to talk to you anytime you want. I also think that dying isn't that bad. - So you're not afraid. - I'm not. But my mom is. So why don't you talk to her and tell her what we just talked about so she can be as brave as you? Like Robinson Crusoe, but with a ticket back home. - Wow! I love your plan. - What's up? When do we take off? - All right! - Thank you so much. We're still very fucking short. How? Did you add what they paid for my car? I almost had to pay them to take it. Wasn't easy to sell that piece of shit. - Christian! - Mari, give us a minute. Listen, we're still quite short, but don't worry, I'm about to convince them. They fired you, Mike. Your show... I was sent to give you the message. Message received. I'm sorry. Silence! We're on the air in five, four, three, two... And we're back, friends, here at "Always in Michoacan" talking to Mrs. Noria about our state's culinary culture. A culture that comes from a mixture, a sort of menage, between the deep regional roots from Purepecha times and the Spanish influence, of course. Let's taste what Mrs. Noria brought for us. Pato! Daisy! Hm! It's a godly delicacy, Mrs. Noria! Tell us, do chongos zamoranos really date back to colonial times? Indeed, Juancho. They came from the convents, during colonial times... Ladies and gentlemen, this is definitely not a colonial costume. Or Purepecha. Hello. My name is Miguel Lopez. Hey, hey! Why aren't we training? I'm the radio host... I mean, I was the radio host in The Ship. For many days, I've been using my show to collect funds to take a kid with cancer to the sea... - Cut to the commercial break! - Don't cut! - Cut to the commercial break! - No, don't cut! - Christian! - You heard me! Do not cut! Yes, sir. Don't cut. My friend Gerardo is one of those people that despite swimming against the tide, seem to go faster than lots of us who have the tide in our favor. Why did he call my show? And why did he ask me to help him? I don't know. I think it was the drugs he got at the hospital. They say people react when provoked. You've got to see this! Well, here you go. I'm gonna run on the streets like this. Yes. Like this. And I won't stop until I collect all the money to take Gerardo and his mom in a ship to the sea, to play in the waves, build a campsite and a bonfire. Help me, please! The bank account number is... I don't know. Pato! Come! Pato! Come! He's Pato. He'll give you all the information. Give them you phone number. But do hand me my briefs. The cup won't hold them for too long. Oh! And the phone. Call me when you have the money! Don't you wanna be a reporter? Why are you standing there? Follow him! Mr. Pato! The phone number is...? Hi, neighbor! Bye! There he is! Follow him! Quickly! Follow him! Go! To the right! When you're ready, cut to commercials, transmit this and upload it. Yes, sir. - Thanks a lot. - Sure. Upload it. Pato! Do we have the money yet? Where are you? Near the "Eleven Patios". Do we have the money yet? I'm a block away from you! Wait! Do we have the money yet? Pato! What happened? Do we have the money yet? - No. - Then what's up? Sponsors are calling to complain that you're already running but you're not wearing your sponsored outfit. What do I do? Give them to me! I'll put them on him. What are you doing here? I told you I won't rest until you make it. Take it! Stop, so I can pin these on. We're live broadcasting! I can't. I said I wouldn't stop! Don't say later I'm sadistic, okay? Like this? Ouch! Ow! Ouch! Ouch! How do you feel? We got three more! But there are more left! I hope this helps! Thank you. Yes. Thank you. I'm on my way! Felipe! Felipe! God bless you! Miguel! Miguel! Miguel! Miguel! You can do it! Miguel! Miguel! Pato! Do we have the money yet? We do! We have the money! We have the money! I told you! People react when provoked. You couldn't get your own shadow to follow you, now you have more than 10,000 followers. Congratulations! And if you add a silly fox tale on your ass, even better! Man! Only here at PopuTV we have our own Patzcuaro radio host that runs in briefs to fulfill dreams. Miguel, sorry to bother you. What can you do to stand out from the rest? Well, now Miguel is following the call of Mother Nature. But in PopuTV, we get there first. We always get the scoop! PopuTV! Always first! - Are you Gerardo? - Yes! I'm Mike. The Ship's captain. I've heard you want to travel to the sea. Yes! Unfortunately, my ship's still broken. Got you, silly face! - When do you wanna go? - This weekend! Can we? As soon as possible. This weekend...? Let me see. Maybe.. - Do you know how to swim? - Yes! Gerardo, besides traveling in my ship, you'll get to meet one of Mexico's most beautiful and most abandoned beaches! Honey! Miguel! We got more cash than we expected. What do you think? This isn't a ship. No, it's an airship. Get in or I'll kill you! Hi, Gerardo! Good morning! I've heard you'll be my copilot. Are you ready? - Yes! - I'll wait for you inside the plane. - Take care of him. - Sure. What? You're not coming? No, buddy. I'm staying. He's a much better captain than I am, anyway.
