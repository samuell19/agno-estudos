THE AUDIENCE As to those who will see him,.. first, everybody kneel when the Holy Father comes. Second, you are strongly required not to speak to the Holy Father. I see there are children. They can speak, because the Holy Father loves to hear the voice of innocence. As for the grown-ups, another very important recommandation: if the Holy Father asks you a question,.. do not sin by pride, but with filial humbleness,.. and exclusively, you must answer: "Yes Holy father, no Holy Father. " < That's it, gentlemen, I'm through. > - How must we... interpret the interdiction of speaking to the pope? - Excuse me? I was saying, how are we to interpret.. the interdiction of speaking to the pope? But it is not an interdiction,.. it is only an advice. We strongly advice not to bother the Holy Father. That's all! Why? Maybe you intend to speak to the Holy Father? No, right? But is it prohibited or not? Come with me, my son. So, if I've understood correctly, you really want to speak to the Holy Father. We'll do what is required. Look at them! Beatiful and well-beheaved. Hello, monsignor Banti speaking. We have a delicate situation to solve. Find Diaz, and send him in the Statues' Hall. Praised be Jesus Christ. What is it? - My son... - Yes? - Let's see this over. You really must speak to the Holy Father? Yes. I've made a long voyage just for this. Excuse me, I'm going. I'll be back later. Do like the others, content yourself with seeing him and getting his blessing. I can't, I must speak to him. - Then you may not enter with them. Don't be sad, your situation has to be solved differently. See, my son, this is a group audience. Come, we'll find another way. Keep calm, calm always bears fruits. Listen! Please! Listen! < Don't make any noise. > - I'm claustrophobic! I said don't make any noise! Will it take long? Where is he? Ah, here he is! My son, would you explain your situation to this gentleman? Do you realize how much time I'm losing? - Calm... Calm down. You'll see, the wait will be beneficial. Come, young man. Aureliano Diaz, official. Glad to meet you. But I don't understand what's going on. - It's only procedures. There are some steps to follow. It will be over in no time. It seems kafkaesque. Hey, young man, stay away from the window! We've had some unpleasant precedents. There's nothing kafkaesque. Formalities, just formalities! Look, I'm not prevented. And I don't insinuate at all that there has been any provocation on your side. However... - May I sit? - Sit, rest. - Thank you. Comfortable? However, I was saying, you must admit trying to abuse our trust. Group audiences are only destined to see... the Holy Father. Sir, indecent magazine. "Playboy"! Well? Then? There's nothing to be said. Do you know it's forbidden?! I've bought it in the station in Bologna. The station in Bologna? Alright. Sir, shall we examine this? There's nothing to examine. It's mine. Give it here. Give it here, I said! And don't you dare hinder our work! Examine it. I protest! It's not pornographic stuff. - Oh, no? Don't be nervous. The innocent is not afraid. - I'm not afraid. Do you like Maigret? - No, I don't like Maigret at all. Rather, can I stretch my legs? < - Sure, sure. > Not by the window, though! < - Ready. > - Okay, let's begin. < - Alright sir. > Step aside, young man. We can't see anything. An interesting find! Didn't I say it? A maniac, just a maniac. Listen... Have you ever been hospitalized in an asylum? What a question! - Are you sure? - No, no. How long have you been in Rome? Where do you live? Have you got money? Are you a member of the Communist Party? I'll give you my wallet now. There are all my documents. Here! A great pope. The pope of peace. Let me see this stuff. Keep it. My glasses. "National Union officers on leave." What? You're an officer? And you didn't mention it?! - Nobody asked me! And you? Shut it off! Don't you search the pockets? Don't you look into the wallets? Frankly, we forgot. Take it, and excuse us. Here's your suit. Please get dressed. It was a misunderstanding. But you must understand that our preventive suspicion is necessary. Well, what are you waiting for? Go and prepare his suitcase! - Yes sir. But, since you're an officer on leave... - Give me that. And if I weren't an officer, how would it have ended? Huh? All's well that ends well. Don't worry, those responsible took note of your desires. Go, go to your hotel. Hotel Columbro, isn't it? - Too kind of you! Go to the museums. You'll see, we'll let you know once the right moment comes. Alright? Thank you for the magazine. See you soon. - I hope not. Here, I must go through. You can't with this one. You need our card, it's different. How's that? I'm an officer on leave! "Italian Army"! You can't. - Check it up. What is the matter? - He wants to get in. It's not possible. - Are you Italian? Hello. You need a pass to enter the Vatican. Go there. I can't do anything... Stop! Where are you going? I must get in. Officer on leave. Private house! - I seek an interview with the Pope. Officer wants to speak to the pope! For audiences, there. Can't you read? Private house! - For visits, down there! Military pass. Private house! Private house! But I won't move from here! Here, anteroom private house. What are you doing with that tool? Put down that halberd, German! Away, please! - Dear Sir, the Middle Ages is over! Come, we can see the Pope's gardens from here. - I'm coming. Good day, sister. - Good day. May I help you? Have you got a record with pope John? Yes, we have a Long-playing. Thank you. Would you like to listen it? - Yes, thank you. - Please. Mine is only one voice, But it carries the voice of the whole world. All the world is represented here. You could say.. Do you sell a lot? that even the Moon.. was in a hurry tonight. Watch it in the sky... Here we are. - What do you want? - Nothing, just looking. You know that with your mania for walking, you're ruining my feet? Say, do you ever tire? I don't have to answer. Or is this a regular interrogatory? No interrogatory. Pope John. Formidable voice. Listen Amedeo, you really suffer from persecution mania. But I don't tail anyone. It happens that for my work I.. have to walk a lot, and so we meet. Clear? Thank you, sister. The truth is that you're tailing me! So, will you spend Easter in Rome, or with your family? I'm an orphan. You'd like me gone, huh? But I'm not leaving. I've got to solve my problem. You must see me as a friend. Do you have your card with you? - Why? Take out your officer card. Swear you'll keep the secret. How, swear? - On your honour. Alright. - There, see. Let's swear. I'll show you the right way. - Lord. I swear upon my honour. Good. Now, write down this phobe number: 45-50-33. Wrtite this name as well: Aiche. Write it, write it. Call her up, follow my advice. Did you write it? - Yes. Sometimes, the winding roads are the best. But I'll deny having said anything. I'm a curious woman. Who gave you my number? I'm supposed not to reveal his name. I'm sorry. Aiche, try this one, it should fit you. Don't be mean, tell me. What's your opinion? My friend Diaz! And how can I help you? I really can't imagine! It's a privatre matter. I'm going to try it. Come. The gentleman is really mysterious. - Does it fit here? What am I to do for you? Help me... meeting the Holy Father. Me? Yes. And what have you to say to the Pope? I'm sorry, but I'll say this only to the Holy Father. Is it such a big secret? - Don't smile. I'm not mad. Sorry. What an ordeal! It might look incredible, but.. but I write everything down. Lsiten what a "Via Crucis"! "On February 2nd, my first request for an audience with the Pope. Arrested, but immediately released. From the February 3rd to April 20th,.. uselessly called on the Vatican offices. Do you like me? Even if the answer is quite obvious,.. yes. Do you always look at the women this way? I'm looking at you because you're beautiful. Listen, but how come you know someone like Diaz? You know, I'm a woman alone. A policeman as a friend is convenient. But don't trust too much what Mr. Diaz says! Indeed, I don't trust him, I only trust you. Do you mind if I do some shopping? Good day. Is this marrow sweet? - Like sugar, miss! Special! How much? - Won't it be too floury? - No! I have the green beans you love. Would you like some? Are they tender? - Salad... Please, leave it there for later. I must speak to her. - Sure, take your time! So? Our Amedeo, what do you think of him? Well,...little mad. We must find out if he is, or if he plays it. I haven't figured it out yet. That's why we need your help. Maybe you can find out. My nose says he's dangerous. Especially in this general situation. You must watch him. Day and night. He asked me to accompany him to Saint Peter's. Can I? Yes, you can. Piazza San Pietro is well surveilled. But try distracting him. You certainly don't lack the means! I'll do my best. There, good. Do your best. You know we've always helped you, when you needed it. Now is the moment for you to help us. Do you like daisies? I know the guy next to the pope. It's prince Donati. Pope! Pope! - Amedeo! Please don't shout, one doesn't call the pope. If I shout maybe he'll hear me. maybe he'll even see me. Holy Virgin! Amedeo, get up, everyone's looking at you! You're worse than a child. Amedeo! Let's start all over again. If I and the pope were atop a high tower,.. and you'd have to throw one of us into the void,.. who would you throw? Answer. Be frank. The pope would jump by himself. Just because he is the pope. And what if he wouldn't? Then... Then...I think I'd throw down you. Enough of this game! Babe! I'm feeling lonely. Come here. I can't. You've thrown me down. I got it. You win. Let's throw the pope. You've said it! You've spared me, I'm yours. You're the most generous man... Smooth talker! I've ever known. And now I'll take care if you with all my heart, with all my body. What would you prefer, money or a gift? You chose. You don't understand anything. I don't want any present from you. I've slept with you.. it's because you're different. I've accepted the risks. What risks do you mean? Of losing all my friends. I don't want to talk about it. Want some? I want to be honest. When I said I'd throw the pope,.. I lied. I know. But I liked hearing you say it. I don't feel at ease. - Come. The prince is important, he can do lots for you! Why are you ringing? - To announce ourselves. Oh, my dear! We were awaiting you with anxious despair. Excuse- me if I can't... Let me introduce you to an important friend, has just arrived from Portugal. Don Matteo,...Aiche. The more beauty is hidden,.. the more we appreciate it. Arab saying. Yes, Aicha! White carnal flower! A small parade for the connoiseurs, yes? Go! There's a gentleman escorting me. Come. I wouldn't want to... Prince Donati. - How do you do? Glad to meet you. - Don Matteo. Obligado. Let's change the music, this commercial folklore isn't of our taste. It is Amalia Rodriguez, but not.. the one we know, right, don Matteo? Please sit down. Thank you. I'm hungry. - What do you do? Is there anything to eat? I must attend to a matter in Rome. Where are you from? - From the North. Milan, moral capital! - Everything alright? Hello! What are these? Typical sweets from my country, monks and angels. Taste them. They seem made for your childish mouth. But eating a monk! I'd love being that monk. It's good! I'd also eat an angel. Enough. - Prince! No, thank you, I've got my own. Just a drop. Don't stuff yourself! Or you'll get fat, with big thighs. These beautiful plebeian thighs! Firm! Listen, listen to this fado! Come, let's dance. - It's not for dancing! Come on, anything's for dancing! Fado is music, fado is beautiful! Love, blood, life! Glory, glory to Gods! Voc? ? um poeta! (You are a poet!) It's the fado! The deep voice of Portugal, of christianity! What pathos! The same pathos expressed in this music,.. we've heard it, one day,.. with the pope, in Fatima. Eh, yes! The pilgrims,.. crosses illuminated in the night,.. the veils... Spectacle of love and death. You're a great storyteller. You're not dancing? Only fox-trot. Do you know Portugal? No. What do you think about our overseas colonies issue? Now that we remained the only ones to testify the European presence.. in the poor African continent. I wouldn't know... my ideas on the matter are not too clear. That's not good, young man! I don't mind politics. I'm in the grip of a profound spiritual labor. Please. Come. Incomprehensible... What's going on? He always forgets the cushion. Let's proceed. Maybe I should leave you alone. Who do you mean? I'm doing it for you! Well, then I'm staying. Aicha is only my Good Samaritain! Come to me. Dissolve your hair, Aicha. Like this. Wise and learned! My friend Amedeo needs a big favor from you. Alright. Yes. In a moment, I'll listen to him. Thank you. You may speak, young man. My main goal is to speak alone with the pope. Unfortunately, it seems this is very difficult, if not impossible. I've kept a diary, and I'll read you some facts, so you can get an idea. February 2nd, pope's audience,.. arrested, but immediately released. From February 3rd to April 20th,.. frequent visits and requests at the Vatican offices. Result: none. That's the chronicle. But allow me to read a few thoughts. Day by day, I feel increasingly deployed in a Kafkaesque situation. Diaz, a sinister character,.. ties me to him through a sort of ambigous friendship,.. "Liason dangereuse!" By now, everyone in the Vatican knows I must speak to the pope,.. except the pope. Monseigneur Amerin can solve your problem. Why not go see him? He's a good element. He's part of the youthful entourage.. that has brought an innovative atmosphere into the Vatican. Lucky you, who always have the pope before your eyes. This piazza is an hymn to God. It's true. From here, as Ungaretti said,.. Ah, Ungaretti! "Immensity illuminates me." But let's not get carried away. Come see. You're the officer Donati told to me about? Look at the present he gave me. Some Port? - No, thank you. Donati always uses the old method, do ut des. He can't renounce his old-fashioned methods. Sit down. - Thank you. Sorry, I've only got three minutes for you. Your request is most unusual. But nobody can dispute your right, and I'm here to help you. Thank you, monseigneur. But you must have patience. We too are consumed by bureaucracy! If you'd know how many people have problems, at all levels! We would need 48hr days, in order to solve them. However, for those who love truth, the dialog is always feasible. Do you believe in dialog? - Yes sir. You must understand that the Church is experiencing exceptional, positive times. Do you know the last pontifical encyclical? Here. Yes, thank you. Actually, I've read it carefully when it was published. However, I'll refresh my memory. Thank you. But, since you haven't got much time,.. what am I to do? I'm heading out, in fact, excuse me. But I don't think I wasted your time. It's useful to discuss these topics. I'll take care of your case personally. Where are you staying? At a friend's. Lying is a sin, you know? Although venial. 4-5.. 5-0-3-3. Monseigneur, then I can rely?... Who talks to me can and must rely on me. Why? It doesn't matter. Monseigneur... Pope! Hello? Assunta speaking. He's not here. He's here, he's here. It's me, Amedeo. Yes. Tonight at 19:00? Thank monseigneur Amerin. Thank him, I humbly thank him. Is father Amerin waiting for you? Please, step in. In the little room in the back. - Thank you. Sit down. I know, we all know, that our friend Amedeo.. wants to speak to the Holy Father, but he didn't tell us why. He might think we are not important enough to access his problems. No! Don't get me wrong, it is not that. It is that, about my problem, I must talk to him first. What happens next? It's for you to tell us. Listen, don't be suspicious, confide in him. Our Superior is very close to the Truth. Very good! Leave this brother alone! We are powerless against Amedeo. He's in his own right! Amedeo, don't stand,.. sit down. We can go on. To your victory. Babe... Tell me. You never tell me anything, honey. Stop it, huh? OK, I'll tell you everything. Through a phone call,.. it was monseigneur Amerin,.. I was summoned in a very luxurious restaurant. Keep talking, tell me all. There were a lot of important people. Dutch priests, expert in theology, monseigneur Amerin... And, do you know who? - Who? The world's greatest theologist. A very noble man. I'd say... even hieratic. - Amedeo! Be crazy all night long... please. Pervert! Don't be impulsive. You have to learn to be gentle with women. Gentle... Do you know you're very sexy naked? Let me see you,.. slut! Maybe, what we are doing, is not alright. They always end up knowing everything... And then, goodbye pope. No. Kiss me. Making love is not a sin. Love is sweet. - Do you love me? - Yes. Do you like me, or do you love me? Both, my beautiful slut. Things are moving. Thank you, monseigneur, I owe it to you. Don't be childish. I'd have gladly avoided this visit. Monseigneur... Listen, irresponsible,.. don't count on me, in any case! Understood? Come. Good day, your Eminence. No, Eminence. No! Don't lose your temper! Not at all easy! You young people are in error! You must punish, when you have to punish! With these new ideas, I do not know where we will end! And you, shame on you! Sorry for the delay, your Eminence. And you have used your influence for such a case? I couldn't have imagined that the situation... What about the responsibilities of your rank? Shake up hierarchies! See, I didn't know this fellow personally, but.. he was introduced to me as an officer on leave,.. more than respectable, by someone I vouch for. So... I'll have a word with your father, irresponsible! Poor old man! Take heart! Your Eminence,.. undoubtly, I dwelled too much on this case. But I felt so much anxiety in this young man! And may be this anxiety that involved me.. and made me act recklessly. You are always so understanding, huh? - Eh, yes. But in conclusion, what am I accused of? Of an unspeakable behaviour, of unacceptable ideas. Of course, you looked for the backing of the modernist trend! Your Eminence, it seems a bit excessive... Do not interupt me, monseigneur Amerin! Maybe now's the right time... No, later. My dear monseigneur, why disturb the Dutch priests? You and your experiments! You become an accomplice to a serious offence: lese majesty of the Church. For example, look. Once, no newspaper would be allowed.. to speak of the pope in this cruel and irreverent way! What do you say, Monseigneur Amerin? What? The newspapers write the pope is ill, gravely ill. What if he dies without talking to me? Drop dead! "If the pope dies"... And a jinx even! Something sweet against bad mood, from our Donati. They are good, your eminence. - You want to be forgiven, huh? - No... So, you want to speak to the Holy Father? And who are you to aspire to much? A president, a king, a Nobel prize? I recognize that I am no one,.. but I've been waiting for months! Look, I have a documentation... Please, check it. Meeting the pope is something extraordinary. I think you'll agree at least with that. But you'd like to create a case, that's what you'd like! If you love him, pray for him! Instead of plotting behind his back with unspeakable acts! Think, meditate,.. renounce to pride and have faith. Forget my slap. And remember that all of us.. help those who deserve help. And if you'll deserve it,.. it will be us to smooth over all difficulties. Interesting lesson, wasn't it? But as you see, we are taking care of you. You are ungrateful, to make that face. Yes, but I'm the one who got slapped! And you didn't move a finger for me. Yes, you took the slap,.. but, in there, I was the main accused. Your intestine fights do not concern me. My right has been recognized, and if you don't help me, I'll act alone! And me who was counting on you! Some help you were! You had nothing better to do but fall in love with that moron! You are just a bitch always in heat! Here's what you are. But he did nothing bad, so far. Shut up! Shut up! You don't even know a compress! You could have put more water! Yes, go on like this! You'll see! Will you answer it or not? Yes? Hello? You're back from Varese? Today I can't. - Sure, say no to clients, even! Call me back in two days. You had an activity well under way... If you take it his way, bye! We've always helped you, and could have helped you again. That's it, go on! You're all flesh and thighs! Beautiful, but... Don't say anything. Babe? Ha! We've got company! Hi. - Hi. And you, what do you want from me? I've been charged to tell you to be more careful. Times are changing, my dear,.. and you must slow down your revolutionary attitude. We're going through hard times. If you wish, ask those youngsters who dare throw rocks at us. Look, I'm a good citizen, and I'm not afraid of anyone's advice. Is that so? well, since you accept no advice, give one to me yourself. Advise me on a good product for stopping hair fall. Since there's nothing worse than wearing that helmet, as I'm forced to do. And with this, I'm through. Please, do you have a plastic bag for that contraption? Sure, shake your head! Thank you. Thanks for the coffee as well. Done that on purpose? Prudence, huh? Prudence. Thank you, dear. The earth never.. will give me.. the smart one could not speak... alone! They think they'll tire me! Poor fools! It's them, the simpletons! They don't know what I'm capable of. I, the smart one! The smart one, didn't know how to speak... didn't know how to speak... Amedeo, please! Amedeo! Yes? What do you have in mind? You'll see... Why don't you quit? Don't you see that it's impossible? Let's go away from Rome. Let's emigrate, eventually! Watch out, they can be nasty. But you're not listening! Yes, you're right,... but mine is a serious problem. I either solve it, or I go crazy. I'll give it one last try. I send him a message, directly, without intermediaries. Do you mind? You must use the hand of my divine providence. Hit hard. Easy. "Pope! I'm waiting for my audience, 455033" He will call me, you'll see! Long live the pope! A madman! Let's run! - Arrows against the pope! It's an attempt! He's throwing poisoned arrows at the pope! Here he is! Quickly! This time, you pay for all! Here he is! The damn obsession with windows! Get down, get down! But who, who gave you an officer's card? You, an officer? Poor Italy! - Ouch! Stand, on attention! Monseigneur is expecting you. - Alright. At your orders. Hello, Diaz. I'm sorry for being late. Everything alright? - I can't complain. You understand, monseigneur, the responsibility I'm assuming. What you're asking me is very dangerous. Yes, but we must avoid all negative publicity, now. You perfectly kow that, right? Please, sit down for a moment. - Alright. Go! - Do you mind? I have to write a couple of lines to give you. It'lll just take a second. Care for a drink? - Merci, tr?s gentil. A digester? Pas mal. It should do us good, after all we've been through. And me? You're abusing our liberality! Pride is your sin! You still have to learn humility and obedience. The recklessness of you, and of people like you,.. can destroy the fruits.. of our hard labour. So far, we have left you do. But from now on, you'll have to obey. First, you must disappear. We'll settle you down, and will watch over you. And me? Shouldn't I have to agree? I might have been wrong, but I think it's human to reply. Your agreement is not necessary. Done. Take the letter, and the gentleman, to this address. Get up, wretch! Explain everything, and give it to father Ambrogio. The answer? - There isn't any. Please. Come. Thank you for the digestive. - My pleasure. What do you want? - Police. I have a letter for father Ambrogio. Wait here, please. Smell, smell this good smell of mint! Breath, breath deeply. You're lucky to remain here! Hieratic! Beautiful and majestic. And similar. Similar to what? Similar! Like all works of art. Where are you going? Are you mad? Spitting in spring water! Excuse me. Good day, sir. - Praised be Jesus Christ. To all eternity. No antics! Off these handcuffs! Look, father, to each his own trade! I know how to treat my people! To you the crucifix, to me the handcuffs. Forgive me for being abrupt. We know you're an excellent officer,.. but our convent has rules to be respected, you understand? Alright, father. Look, I'll satisfy you. Do you know this gentleman's crimes? Laugh, laugh! I wouldn't, if I were you. Yes, I know it all. I've read the letter. You're not still mad? Me? No, not at all. Glad to have met you. - Goodbye. I leave him in your hands. Father, show the gentleman out. You, come, follow me. You'll have an accommodation. Sir, I'm saying this for your own good, try and stay quiet. Everything will work out, I'm sure. - Come on, cover me up! Here's your cupboard. - Cover me up! Some respect, for you and the others, and for God who sees you! And order and cleanliness before anything else. Have you understood? Thank you. - Good bye. Peace and good, Giovanni. - Get in the habit! Peace and good! Deranged! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... Just to break the ice... I'm Amedeo. And I'm father Giulivo. Why do you count? Not to say bad words! - Excellent system! Is the brother always like this? That's not a guardian father, he's a jailer father! I noticed. I am Giovanni Rossi, mechanic. - Amedeo. - Welcome, son. But I know you! - It's possible, son. Peace and good. One moment, brothers, before eating! Do you remeber well all your vows? Poverty,.. chastity,.. but above all, obedience. You may eat. Amen. The kingdom of heaven is like a householder,.. who, early in the morning... I feel like being back in the barracks! - Almost. How's chow? - Good and plenty! Not bad, this pasta e fagioli. Not bad at all. Brother Giulivo! - Huh? I think it's time to go. Alright. We want to read..- Where are you going? - a document we deem very important. a letter written by the mother of priest Camillo Torres.. and addressed to his holiness. - What's the use of talking about this? There are more important things. There are no more saints, even... Not at all saints and holy! Too many saints are useless! Why useless? My mother's name is Philomena.. I don't even know when I should celebrate her! Brothers! It's not enough to talk about political freedom. We must have the courage... - Scandalous brother! to...confront with.. sexual freedom. The Church is not a constitutional republic,.. but a holy order with its hierarchy! With a chief, infallible by dogma! You, don't you forget this, brothers,.. must be the enforcers of his infallible will. Say useless! A Church without saints, is not a church! - Silence everyone! Stop eating everyone! Evacuate the refectory! Go! Chicken! Please, what has this got to do with me? I'm a guest, I have to eat! Be patient, my son. There's a shop here. With money, you can have everything. There's cheese, sausage, chocolate, fruits, nuts... Patience, patience! - But it is not for the food. It's for..the principle. - You're young, a little hunger won't hurt. I pay, I must eat. May the night be a sweet one, sailor! Vulgar! May God be with you. Who was it? A friend. His name? A friend! And you meet your friends in a 'little sailor' suit? Why are you lying? Are you mad? It wasn't a friend, it was the prince. A pervert and nothing else. English songs, psychedelic lights! You disappear for a long time,.. I wait for you, I want to be nice... and you slap me as soon as you're back? You don't own me! The prince... A gift from the prince! Can't you chose better friends? Don't you have one who's really important? Don't treat me like this! You must respect me! - Be quiet! I'm a woman, not an animal! Stop it. What are you doing, getting undressed? Stay in the sailor suit, won't you? And forgive me. I won't. I have to tell you something. I'm pregnant. Have an abortion! I don't want to. Then, I'll be the godfather. Don't you understand it is your child?! And why should he be mine, if I may? Because I only make love with you. Don't say anything, or I'll smash your face! It's useless. You only think of yourself! Go away. Don't touch me! Go away! I love you. I use the others to survive in this rotten world. How can you tell me to have an abortion? Don't you touch me! I'm turning off the light. Maybe it is my child. I believe and understand you, but you try and understand me. We both have a problem. Let's make peace. Let's see how to help each other. Why don't you give it up? We could be happy, you, me, and the child. We could get married. I've got some money, let's open a restaurant. I can cook, you know? - Very well, even! What an absurd situation! Could you lend me some money, please? What a shame! Why do you talk about lending? What's mine is yours! But I give you nothing! I know it doesn't add up! You know it, I write everything down. And forgive me. If it's my child, he'll be mine. You can't get in and out as you wish. - Prisoner, huh? Not in daytime, much less at night. You must stay in the monastery. I remind you that, by sending you here, they've done you a big favour, clear? I realized that! What do you expect? That I'll resign and stay here? If at least you knew exactly my story. Yours is a madman's story, and they're wrong in giving you free rein. If it were up to me... You're only a bit player in my drama. Anyhow, I'm not your prisoner, so.. I'm leaving, whenever I feel like it. Forget all this! You have only one good chance: get married! Excuse me, you said? Get married, settle down! So you'll have a hearth, you'll have roots! You'll stop thinking of absurdities! Who with, if I may? Don't be smart, we know everything. With the woman you're associated with, and who helps you financially. Oh, good! Now I'm a gigolo! My dear father,.. do you know what that lady's trade is? She's a whore. You're childish and mean! Think about Mary of Magdala. Think about Mary of Magdala,.. and of the child about to be born. There! I would have bet! Who says the child is mine? And who says he's not? Go to sleep, you'll have plenty of time to meditate. I can do without your advices, thanks. And thanks for your hospitality. And remember that you won't get out of here if you don't clarify your mind! Do you remember your vows? Poverty, chastity... but above all, obedience! Who hung that picture? There's no room for Mao here! I'm waiting for an answer. Have at least the courage to speak up! Have you heard the Superior? Speak, or we'll stay here till evening. Brothers!.. I call you to obedience! Brother Giulivo, brother Michele, and that one, the american priest,.. do you know anything? Come out! The Church is not a constitutional republic, but a holy order with its hierarchy! Good day, Giovanni. - Good day! Even today we protest and do not eat, huh? But I've got some processed cheese. So we'll have a nice picnic. Ready for the treatment? - Ready. Now I'll make you a massive injection! But what are you doing? Packing my stuff. I'm leaving. And I remain here alone? If you want, you can come and stay with me. You know my problem. Sure I know it, but you won't solve it here, your problem. You must forgive me... I ran away because I couldn't stand it anymore. Now I'm asking you, like to a father. What's going on? It's all so confusing! Brother tree, how sad you are! Now nobody takes care of these plants any more. What a pity! Look at these flowers! All dead! It's the gas from the cars that kills the plants. It's not the cars! Look at this desolation! It is the lack of faith of men. Confusing, clear... Everything would simple, if we only learned to be simple. You should know. Deep down you are a simple. I know it is hard to obey. I know from experience.. that at times we are tempted to free ourselves from what is burdening us. It is true! But it's a heavier burden to realize that we're losing our faith. Trust me, Amedeo. Outside the rules,.. there is delirium and chaos. It's a stupid conceit wanting to change.. order and tradition that are powerful and irreplaceable! It's a stupid conceit... in which even I fell. But, luckily,.. I realized it on time. By the way, I got good news for you. Lately, I revised your case . I searched through the archives,.. and I didn't find even a shadow of your application for an audience. That means we are in the best condition.. to start all over the procedures, from scratch. So, it's still feasible. I took a form with the new dispositions. Take it. - But it can't true! I won't fill any form! And then,.. I don't feel like waiting any longer. Listen, take this form. It's easy to fill. Find some good string to pull... Do you want to speak to the pope, or be a gigolo? You must not offend me. I am not a gigolo! Do you want to see the pope? Fill this,... and find a letter of recommandation. From your parson... And have faith. Enough! Hello. - Hello to you! - Hello, dear Giovanni. How's everything? - Fine. "La Piet?" decapitated. Nice! Good work! I see your hand is still very firm. Oh, look who's here! Our Amedeo! But what you're doing? What are you doing in that corner? Weren't you better off in the monastery? And then, you know you've must have a domicile,.. a job. You know that, don't you? Do not worry. He works and lives with me. So then,.. how 's business, Govanni? - Well... - Good? Not bad... Bicycles sell well, huh? - Yeah... They are in big fashion now, huh? The license, is it in good standing? - Sure. There, on the wall. Look. May I give it a peek? Be my guest. And you, Amedeo, how's money? Got enough for my sustenance. Don't lie to me. And this, what is it? It represents the Church destroyed by faith. Come, come here. What's the meaning of the work? - Protest! I did myself, it with all my love. Very beautiful. - In all modesty, yes. But let's cover it up, this model. Make it disappear. Because now, they throw real bombs. - It's a pity, but I'll obey. As for you, I just want to warn you about something very important. You have to keep good and quiet, got it? Because for you there is already a travel order ready,.. and we have excellent eyes and memory, don't forget. Alright, I'll keep good and quiet. Beware that I cannot always be generous. Patience has its limits. The prince is down there, with his men. Alright. What do you want? I have a message for the prince. Then come. Wait here. Excellency, a message for you. Yong man! Well, who are you? Who sent you? Why do you want me? - But,.. don't you remember me? I'm Amedeo, Aiche's friend. Oh, Aicha! I didn't solve my problem at all, with monsegnieur Amerin. Snap! Come back! My young obtuse friend, you come here to speak about nonsense,.. when there's only one way to defend faith,.. christianity, civilization... Preparing to fight! Come with us, young man. We live in open air,.. a patriotic life, full of deep spiritual values. No I can't. I even have bronchitis. - There, young man. Good man, don't ask, just take! What are you doing? Get up! It is time to reaffirm the mystique of heroism! No more intellectual moaning! We're preparing to fight for immortal values! Join us! Help us to defend you, rather! Get up! - Ouch, ouch! See, that's the course, marked in red. It goes up to here, see? Now, the 3 points less guarded, are: .. this, this, and that. Got it? Good luck, son. Thank you. May God bless you! Thank you. Long live the Holy Father! Long live the pope! Where are you going? Stop! Stop! The pope! Pope! Hold still! Let me through! Come, come here! Let go of me! Do you like the black spider? See that we found you a nice toy? But don't eat it right away! Doctor? - What? They tied me up. - Tied up? I'm not mad! Came in last night? -Why is he tied? - Don't know. Let's uncover him. I want to go home! With all that's happening in here! I want to go home! - He's only got a little fever. I want to go home! - Sure! Go home, go home...! Too easy, dear sir! First you make a mess, and then you get to scream! You know that, after your mischief last night,.. you're under arrest? Excuse me, we're examining the detained's situation,.. and it would be right, even mandatory, to keep him in. I'm sorry sir, but we cannot hospitalize him. The patient is perfectly sane. He's not dangerous. He's got a severe pulmonary commotion. We'll keep him for a few days, then we'll have to dismiss him, absolutely. You know... Look, it was a mistake already, to send him in this department. Besides, with our shortage of beds... You're two young doctors, in this hospital. With an assured professional future. Let's hope so! - Then follow my advice,.. keep him in here for a while. I am following him since a long time, and I think that he's not of sound mind. Have you done an encephalogram? We're not playing this game! It's not a game, I'm saying it for his own good. Our deontology forbids it. Do you agree? Anything else? Okay, thanks anyway. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Have a nice career - Thank you. Look, look in the chronicle. Police? - Shut up, assassin. Are you "Ginko"? (cartoon investigator) Not even Unit? reports the news! I'd like to know why newspapers should care about you! Can you tell me why? You're nobody. It isn't that they told them?... Listen, want an advice? Did I hurt you? Leave Aiche alone. I'm saying this for her own good, for everyone's good. You must forget that woman, understood? And the child? The child! Children grow up! And then look what they become. Delinquents! I'm not mad! And I'll get out of here on my own feet! You went well this time too, huh? But beware! There is no two without three! Even if the papers don't mention it,.. the pope knows it! And even if the pope... knows it,.. maybe, he'll forget it. He pretends not to know,.. because he's afraid. Even him, the pope! Go away! I have to talk to you. I must tell you something important. Please... Aiche... listen. What do you want? Come in. Listen, I need you,.. and I should get married. No, it's too late. How, too late?! I have good hope that my problem will be solved. So then, I'll recognize the child, and,.. we'll open that restaurant. Go away. Farewell. You're driving me out? It's my child! I've got my rights on him! Amedeo! The lady has asked you to leave this house immediately. Amedeo, don't be rude. You can keep the lady. You two make the perfect couple! P & P: prostitute and policeman! But the child is mine, and I'll take him away! Who, you'll take, who? My child! - I wanna see that! - Don't shout! Aureliano! The baby's crying. I've always done my duty superficially, with you. Like in a game. But the game is over now. Enough! Forget this child. Forget this house. But don't forget this, okay! Out! Don't hurt him! Ah, bravo! Even the kiss now! Don't be too sweet with him. He doesn't deserve it. He was kind to me. And he'll raise your son well. It wasn't my fault. I couldn't wait any longer. I write everything down, you now that. Amedeo, forgive me. You won't exploit this girl any more! Mind you, I write everything down! Unlucky, but honest! Write, write! You need a moral alibi, huh? You don't even have the guts to be a delinquent! Forgive me, sister. Please,.. could I listen to pope John's voice? At home, you'll find the children. Give a caress to your children! Tell them: "This is the pope's caress". "You'll find some tears to wipe". Do it with a kind word. The Father is with us,.. more so when we're sad and bitter,.. and then let's hearten all together,.. singing, sighing, crying,.. but always full of confidence.. in Christ who helps us and listens,.. so that we can continue our journey. So then, receive the blessing I'm giving you,.. and also... - Poor man! So loved! Without a mother, without anyone. A new year is beginning today. What kind of year, who knows. Let's hope for a good one The Council begins, and we don't know when it will be over. May it be over before Christmas. But maybe, we won't manage to say everything,.. to understand each otherwell, on everything. We may have to meet again,.. but if, meeting again, means brightening... What is it? You don't feel well? Do you need help? It's nothing. I'm cold. Right of asylum... Not even that!? Oh, yes! Private house! Tonight I'm going to the movie. My wife insisted. Hello? We'll take care of it. They said there's a man on the ground under the colonnade. There goes our evening! Imagine if it wasn't him to spoil my evening! Come on, enough with antics, will you get up or not? Get up! Come on, move it! I order you to get up! Understood? Hey! He's dead! You're needed at the St. Anna gate. It's important. But what's going on tonight? Come, come. Cover him up. Alright sir. I'm telling you, that's how it is! I don't understand, I've told you... At ease... It's seems kafkaesque! Good evening sir. This man wants to speak to the pope. Actually, it's true. I've been waiting since 11:00 this morning. I think I'm in my own right,.. I don't know what's going on,.. Allow me, Aureliano Diaz, officer. - Glad to meet you. Come with me. - Where to? - Formality, simple formality. Just a few procedures, it won't take long. But what? They haven't taken him away yet? Nothing, a poor guy, who died of pulmonary congestion.
