Bye now. Speaking of holiday cheer, you sure look full of it. Yeah, I'm just thankful that we planned these articles a year out. But you've still got to have your pitch for the meeting tomorrow. Remember, the feature and the cover are on the line here. Thank you for the added layer of pressure. Not that I needed it. I'm just sayin', after Daniel's cover story about the history of The Nutcracker last year, it got a lot of eyes, hon. And Daniel got a book deal. I know. Be like Daniel. Be like Daniel. Ha! All right, guys, tomorrow morning, uh, 8:30 a.m. sharp, but I gotta say I need a little more nuance. You know, a little more flair. I need our readers to have an experience on the page, 'cause if they can't travel the world for Christmas, we're going to bring Christmas to them, okay? Youse got it? All right, I know you do. Don't let me down. It just seems like every Christmas tradition on the planet has already been covered already... I mean, Christmas wedding, done. Christmas on the ranch? Done. Do you want a Christmas cruise? Done. There isn't a gingerbread competition, a quaint village or a tree lighting we haven't explored. - What else is left? - Christmas in space? Do you think I could do it? Look, maybe you're thinking too globally here. Girl, the holidays are all about family. Maybe you should try looking closer to home? Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm sure the readers would love to hear about my parents struggling to take the Christmas decorations down from the attic. Speaking of which, I promised I would go help them later tonight, so... I'm going to go grab some leftovers from the party and head out. Oh, lots of missed calls. See? Family time. Who knows? Maybe you'll get some inspiration. I don't need inspiration, I need a Christmas miracle. Go on and get that Christmas miracle, girl. Thank you. Lord, help her. Hey, it's Dad. Wondered if you could pick up some coffees on the way over. Love you. Hi, Ms. Wallace. I'm just calling about your car's extended warranty. Hi there, Campbell. Um... I-I'm Jennifer Bergeron. I'm not sure if you got my letter earlier this year, but I think I'm... Oh, goodness, this is so... I think I'm married to your father... Everett? Sorry... ♪ Christmas is coming ♪ The snowflakes Will be falling... ♪ Mom! Dad! Are y'all home? - I got coffee. - Ah, bless you. I thought the coffee would never get here. And you, of course. But mostly the coffee. Hey, kiddo. Hi. Your holiday favorite. Oh! Is that nutmeg I'm tasting? - Mm-hmm. - Don't get too cozy. We can't take a break until everything's down. She's so bossy. Hey, it was your idea to get a jump start on clearing out the attic. Remind me to keep my mouth shut. Mm! Oh, no, no, no, we did beach Santa last year. Let's do, uh, Vegas Santa this year. - Right. - I don't want to keep you too late, because you, young lady, have a pitch to write. I know, I know. - Hey, Mom? - Yeah? Do you mind if I take this Campbell box home with me? Hi, Everett. Can you get that, hon? It's probably the Pere Noel Festival planning committee! Bergeron residence. Everett speaking. Hello? Is anyone there? Uh, yeah, hi. Um... Um... is... Jennifer Bergeron there? I'm-I'm calling for this Christmas... Yeah, yeah. Hang on, she's right here. - Here you go. - Oh. Hello. Hi. J-Jennifer. This is, uh, Campbell Wallace. You left me a voicemail? Yes, of course! Uh... can you give me a minute? Christmas emergency. Um, you can start without me, I'll be right there. Sure. Well, um... hi there, Campbell. Uh, this is, um... Well, I'm just so glad that you called. Yeah, well, you left me a voicemail. Oh, and my letter a few months ago? What... How did you find me? It wasn't easy. I kept looking for an Alice Bergeron because that's what he calls you, but... Yeah, there were five Alices in my preschool and my dad gave me the nickname, so... "Campbell" just kind of stuck. Well, um, took me a while, but... eventually I got there. It's amazing what you can find online these days, right? I know that I may be overstepping here, and... when you didn't answer my letter, I figured I should just leave it be. Then why didn't you? Well, um... here in Ascension Parish fires on the levee light... they light the way for Pere Noel, Santa Claus, you know, and our old Pere Noel has retired and Everett has been chosen to replace him. - Okay. - And... it's a big deal. It's an honor that you want to share with your family, and I guess what I'm trying to say is that ever since he's been chosen... he... he just doesn't think he deserves it because... he can't stop thinking about you. I don't know. I thought, well, this is sort of my Hail Mary pass, - to see if... - It's a really nice offer, uh, but I've been fine without him most of my life, so, um, thank you, but... Mom, dinner's getting cold. Yeah, come on. We wanna make Christmas cookies! Just a minute, girls. Who... Who was that? Oh, Mary-Margaret and Amelia. They would be... Well, um... they're your sisters. Oh, focus, um... Okay. Feature... All right, guys, I am loving the international angle right now. Let's run with that. Oh, and the Christmas Barbecue Cook-Off... - Oh. Hello, Campbell. - Sorry. Nice of you to join us. Um, anyway, uh... Oh, the Dallas piece for the Christmas Cook-Off. Fantastic. But for this feature I'm looking for something, something with a bit more culture, you know, a bit more heart, something that we haven't seen before... What's that? - Oh, uh, no. - What's this? - Nope, that's... - Oh, this is fantastic. Are you ready to pitch this? - Yeah. - Let's see this pitch. Give Campbell the floor, guys. All right. Yep. Uh... okay. So... there's this town in Louisiana called Sorrento, uh, where the people try to make Christmas special, even though there's no snow. And so, on Christmas Eve, they light the bayou to guide Pere Noel, their version of Santa Claus, to their homes. And this year, the new Pere Noel is a man named Everett Bergeron. He's a successful businessman. Runs a popular meat pie shop... Right, right, but who is he? Um... I mean, I guess that would be the story, really, figuring that out. I like it. Good job. So, I'm thinking we finish decorating the tree, make some hot chocolate, and... ride around the neighborhood and look at the lights. Way ahead of you on the hot chocolate part. Gary! That was for later. I'm a simple man, Sarah. I see hot chocolate, I drink it. So... somebody had a big meeting today. And somebody is being very quiet about it. Uh, yeah. It was good. I'm in contention for the feature. Well, what are we doing drinking hot chocolate? We should pop open the champagne! It's nothing yet. And, um... it does mean that I'm leaving tomorrow and that I won't see you two on Christmas morning. Landing the feature! Almost landing the feature. Well, almost landing the feature is a big deal. When we open presents isn't. Now, tell us everything. Okay, uh... There's this small town in Louisiana where they ask a man in the town to be, like, their version of Santa Claus. Louisiana? Ascension Parish, actually. Sorrento. So... you want to meet your father. Well, no. Yes? I just... I feel like going is the right thing to do. When you were 13, we sat you down and we asked you if you wanted to meet him, if you wanted to have a relationship with him, and you said that you... I said it was his loss when he left and I have all the family I need. That hasn't changed. Well, I'm not trying to hold you to what you wanted as a child. But I do wonder, why now? Mama, I have sisters. And I do wonder about him. You know? I think that if I don't do this now, I always will. I just don't want you to get hurt, that's all. I know. I... Will you excuse me? You aren't mad at me, are you? Or upset that I would want to meet him? Why would I be mad? You are my dad. And you're a great dad. Campbell, it's okay. I know you love me. And honestly, I had a feeling this day would come. And what about Mom? Is this what you want, kiddo? Yeah. It is. Then she'll come around. I promise. Yeah. Let's finish decorating the tree. - Come on, it'll be fun. - Yes. Coming. Campbell. It's so nice to finally meet you. - Do we hug? - Yeah, sure. Okay. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited. I've been hearing about you, well, since I met your father, so... 20 years? - And here you are! - Here I am. Um, he's running errands and the girls are at school. I thought it would be nice if it was just us for a minute. - Great. Thank you. - Yeah. So, you'll be staying down the road at a cute little cottage owned by friends of ours, the Shepherds. Oh, the Shepherds, they don't know that I'm Everett's daughter? No, no, no, no. No. That's yours to tell, not mine. But they do know about the article, and we're going to give you a lot to write about. Mr. Shepherd is the Pere Noel who's stepping down and his grandson Jackson is the town liaison, so he can help you out too. - Great. - But, uh, look. If it gets too much and you feel like you need to leave... Jennifer? I... I'll be all right. Don't worry. That's what moms do, I guess. We worry. But you're right, um... So, uh... Come on inside. I got that. - And I'll show you... - Thank you. Show you the house. So this is it. So, as you can see, we do like to decorate for the holidays. Yeah, those. Uh... We started making pecan hand pies one year for Christmas, and ever since then, we keep thinking we need help shelling them. Don't worry about it. We collect, um, novelty Santas back home. Um, can I get you anything? It is Christmas, so eggnog or hot cocoa or... - Any water? - I can manage that, yes. Be back in a minute. You just make yourself at home. I did have an idea. You know, if you're not sure that you want to come out and tell Everett who you are? Yeah? Well, since you're already doing the article, maybe you could use that as a cover? You know, observe him, get to know him, and tell him when you're ready. Isn't that a little dishonest? Well, I'm not saying that I feel great about the idea, but... I mean, I came all the way here, right? I should be able to look him in the eye and tell him who I am. Well, of course. You know, I understand, though, if... - Jennifer, are you here? - Oh, um... Sure am, darling! And, uh, we have some company. Company? Hello there. This is Campbell Wallace. Ah, Everett Bergeron. Nice to meet you. Welcome. Um, it's a little complicated to explain, but she's... A reporter. Uh, yeah, I'm here to write a story about you for Airvent magazine. Nothing complicated about it. Okay. So, you're a reporter? Huh? - Surprise! - Yeah, it sure is. Uh, what'd you say your name was again? - Campbell Wallace. - Uh-huh. Um, your wife tipped me off about you becoming Sorrento's new Pere Noel, and we think our readers will love it. Well, look, I'm not much of a story, but... you're the expert. No, you really should read her articles. - Okay. - Um, she's been everywhere. - A real world traveler. - Sure, yeah, yes. Um... And when I cover these things, I get... I get to know the town and, uh, the traditions, and, uh, well, and this time, the man behind the big white beard. And actually, because the honor is about you and your family, I would like to get to know both. If you'll let me. Well... all right, Campbell. Uh, it sounds fine. I just hope I don't disappoint you. Yeah, I hope so, too. Uh, I gotta git... a whole new batch of orders came in. - Oh, for the meat pie business? - Yep. This is the busiest time of year. Seems like every town in a 25-mile radius orders from us, and we ship all over the country. Stick around, I'll show you how we make them. - I would like that. - Yeah. Honey bun. Hey, the mayor's party, you got that covered? Yes. I'll get the delivery going when the girls get home from school. All right. "When out on the roof, there arose such a clatter..." - We're home! Hello? - Hello. Hey, there they are! How are my best girls? How you doin'? - Wow. Father of the year. - How was your last day of school? He's made lots of mistakes, but I know that he would really like to make it right with you. Listen, I gotta fill some orders, so please take care of your mom, okay? Be nice, we have a visitor! Hi! Dad says not to be nightmares because we have a guest. I'm guessing that's you? Hi, I'm Campbell. It's nice to meet you. I'm Amelia. This is Mary-Margaret. Um, Campbell is doing an article on Pere Noel for A irvent magazine. - Yeah. - Oh, great. Love to spend Christmas break with strangers. - Mary-Margaret! - It's okay, I get it. Um... I probably wouldn't want to spend Christmas with someone who writes for an airplane magazine, either, so... Wait, you mean the ones that they give out with the little peanut bags? Yeah, the... the one with the peanut bags. - That's cool. - Yeah. You know what else is cool? Uh, Mom, we know what's cool way more than you do. - Yeah, we're tastemakers. - Oh. Well, how do the tastemakers feel about chores? Um, chores are not trending right now, so... It's good PR for the business. Mary-Margaret runs all of our socials. She's, uh, quite the content creator. Kind of like you. Fine. But only for the 'gram. Well, then it's settled. Catering delivery. So, off. Put on your shirts. - All right, okay. - All right, you too. Go, go! So, would you like to join us? - Sure. I would love to. - Great. Come on. Let's go, girls! We're leaving in ten minutes! Hey. They put you to work already? Oh, don't worry. I'm a very immersive writer. I like to get in the trenches, or the Christmas parties, as the case may be. Okay. So, is this the part where, I don't know, you ask what Pere Noel means to me or my top five Christmas cookies? Oh, you know, well, I have got so many questions for you, you wouldn't even believe. Well, where do we start, then? Uh, what about your girls? Your daughters? My daughters? It's quite a brood you've got there. Oh, yeah. Well... they're my everything. I couldn't imagine life without them. Campbell! Come on! - Oh. - Good luck. You'll need it. Thank you. So, you're a writer, huh? Uh, yeah. I take pictures, too. See? Cool. - Wow, nice. - You wanna try? Um, sure. Uh-uh. Whoo-whoo. So, what do you write about? Um... Je suis une auteure de voyage. That's French for "I'm a travel writer." - Oh. - Oh! And what's French for "Pere Noel's going to bring me a big lump of coal for Christmas"? Pere Noel doesn't even bring coal, that's Santa. - Mm-hmm. There's a difference? - Oh, yeah. See, Pere Noel is Cajun, so he speaks French too. Oh, and he drinks blackberry wine and eats meat pies. And my dad is going to be him now that Mr. Shepherd is retiring. Yes. I've heard about that. I've been told. - Okay, buckle up. - Smile, Mom. - Oh... - Oh, and by the way, we're going to Robert's Coffee House and my dad used to work there, and they have the best beignets, ever. - Okay. Beignets, meat pies. - Mm-hmm. - Okay, so you're ready to do the whole tour? - Yeah. - Let's do it, Mom. - Let's do this. - I can come back out for those. - Oh, no, don't worry. I can get them. I mean, it's a family business, right? Right. Oh! Attention! Whoops. - Well, that's broken. - I'm so sorry. You know, a warning might have been nice. - You don't speak French? - That's the problem with tourists. They come through and mess up the flow of traffic. Yeah, well, no wonder you're mowing people over. - Do you mind if I...? Yep. - Oh. Thank you. So, she knocks over my presents, she makes fun of my nerdy glasses... Well, from one nerd to another, I think they look cute. Um... distinguished. Smart... I mean. - But not well-traveled. - No. Campbell! We're setting up. Yeah, I'm on my way! ♪ You bring out The holly jolly me... ♪ Okay, good, if you could tilt it up towards the Christmas tree. Yeah. Okay. Good. Perfect. Caption time. I need to find a pen. Gotta brainstorm. Oh, Amelia, not on any of the mayor's important stuff. Wait, wait, wait! - Mayor Thomas. - Yes. Mayor Thomas, this is Campbell Wallace. She's doing the article about Pere Noel. Oh, okay. The mayor and Everett go way back. Campbell, it's a pleasure to meet you. - And welcome to Sorrento! - Thank you. Nice to be here. Absolutely. You know, I think she should meet Jackson Shepherd. I think he'd be a great resource for you. Actually, she's staying at his family's cottage. Ah, there you go. Meant to be. He's around here somewhere. Hey, Jackson! Come over here! Jackson Shepherd, this is Campbell Wallace. She's the reporter from the travel magazine. Ah. Well, bonjour,miss. Bonjour indeed. Oh, Mayor Thomas, if you're wondering why the present I got you is broken into a million pieces, that's because of her. Well, Campbell, you can ask this rude young man anything about anything, he knows it all. He's the keeper of all the town records and he helps us out when we have visitors. - Great. - Okay. I just hope I don't ruin your flow, what with me being a tourist, and all. Well, it was her who started. I mean, I feel like you started that before. - And you'll be staying at the cottage? - Yeah. - Excellent. - I can't tell if they're flirting or fighting. - Maybe both. - That's why I put her in the cottage. You're good with people, you know that? Well, it's a gift. What can I say? So, Jennifer, I wanted to ask, what's Everett like, to you? Um, well... he's smart and hard-working. And loving. Um... You know, when I met him, he had just pulled himself out of a really dark place. And he's spent the rest of his life trying to do better, be better. There's not a lot of people you can say that about. And, you know, he makes me laugh... a lot. Tsk... I think I just love him to bits. Yeah, see, I wish I could see him the way all of you do. And I wish he could have been those things for me. - Hey! - Hey. Perfect timing. I just set out the last batch to cool. - Good day? - Excellent. I'm thinking of hiring Campbell. She's a perfect fit for our little operation here. - Okay. - How was your day? Well, much better now that you're here. - Oh. - Come on, let's eat. - Well, well, well, okay. - You too, Campbell. - Campbell. Come on now. - Yep. All right. Ooh, something smells good. - Mmm. - Girls, come on, dinner! I'm just gonna grab my things and head out. You can't leave yet. Stay for dinner. Look, there's plenty of food. I just... I should really get started on writing my article, and I don't want to intrude on family time. Guess what? After dinner, we're making wreaths. It's a family tradition on the first night off school. - You can sit by me. - Uh-uh, she's sitting by me. We're going to talk about photography. Sounds like the girls already saved a spot for you. Now, look, this article is about me, right? Well, to know my family is to know me. Why don't you stay awhile? How can I say no? You can just put your stuff on the chair. Thank you. - Mm-mm. Who's first? - Smells good. For you. "This will be your best Christmas ever." Hi, Mom. Hey, baby. How are you holding up? Uh... getting settled in. You know, meeting my father for the first time, not telling him I'm his daughter. - You haven't told him yet? - I panicked. Well, that's totally normal, sweetheart. It still feels weird. It's kind of like lying, you know? I mean, it's... a lot like lying. Well, it's also a way of keeping yourself safe and get to know him better. How are the girls? Oh, Mom, they're amazing. I mean, Amelia is so spunky, and Mary-Margaret is just such a moody teenager. You know, she's trying to be real cool. She just, like, reminds me a lot of myself when I was that age. And last night we were making wreaths, and, um... Oh, hang on, Mom. Someone's at my door. It's okay. Go. Just call me later. I love you! Love you. Well, look who the reindeer dragged in. Pere Noel doesn't actually have reindeer. Oh, yeah? What does he use, then? Alligators. Oh. The Ayutthaya province has elephants, the North Pole has reindeers, and Cajun country has alligators, naturally. Oh, right. Sorry. Uh, so, your coffee machine here is broken, so I brought you this. My grandma's recipe. I hope you like Cajun eggnog flavor. Cajun eggnog. Never had it. Ah. That's a point for me then. I mean, essentially it's eggnog instead of creamer, with nutmeg, cinnamon, cayenne, and a little imitation rum extract. Sounds different. It's a southern Louisiana tradition, so... Mmm, don't worry, I love different. Believe me, in my line of work, I get plenty of it. - Ever had mopane? - I have not. - What is that? - Worms. It's a Zimbabwean Christmas tradition. That sounds... delicious. It's actually pretty good. Almost as good as this coffee. Glad to hear it. Hey, I was thinking, maybe I'd take you on a tour? You can see the sights. I mean, it's no Zimbabwe... Actually, I'm tailing Everett today, Pere Noel duties, but maybe you could help me do some research after lunch? Sorrento's resident geek is at your service. Great, it's a date then. Um... Yeah, cheers. Cheers. You know, it's a great honor to take on the mantle of Pere Noel from Shepherd here, who's had that distinction for nearly 30 years. Now, as my first official act as Sorrento's new Pere Noel, I'm going to hang the first ornament on the town tree, as a sign that Christmas is just around the corner. Hey, you know, this is the time of year where we're supposed to be the most hospitable and welcoming, so I'd like to ask somebody else to help me. Kind of an honorary Pere Noel assistant for the season. Campbell Wallace. What do you say? - Uh... - Go on! Okay, sure. - Thank you. - Anywhere. - Right here? Yeah? - Yep. - Okay. - There we go. Ta-da! You didn't have to do that. Of course I did. You're our guest. All right, folks join in! "Mo' fassa and fassa, da gator dey came!" "He whistle and holla and called dem by name!" Hey, now, kids, we have a special visitor, coming all the way from the magical land of Dallas, Texas. - Oooh! - Now, I reckon she's never even heard this story before, have you? I can't say that I have. Not this version, anyway. Well then, she doesn't even know the names of Pere Noel's gators. Should we teach her? Y'all want to practice your reading? Yeah! All right, come on up here. - Let's do it. - Okay. - Right here. You ready? - Okay. Here we go. "Ha, Gaston! Ha, Tiboy!" "Ha, Pierre an' Alcee!" "Gee, Ninette! Gee, Suzette!" "Celeste an' Renee!" - Not my best performance. - Oh, that's all right. Look, that's for you. Now you can practice. That's how you get ahold of Pere Noel on Christmas Eve. - Thank you. - And remember your time down here. All right, now, kids, how does the story end? "Merry Christmas to all, 'til I saw you some mo'!" All right. Hey, hot chocolate right over here. Oooh! Hi there. Come in. Oh, hey. Glad you could make it. Wow... festive. Yeah, I get pretty focused on my work. Yeah, I mean, I get it. Practical. Ah, what the Japanese call shibui. Boring? Understated. Oh, hey. So, the town paper is doing a series on Everett. Asked me to pull all the public files on him, old articles, government files, photographs. So I thought maybe you could use it for your article as well? That's incredible. Yeah, thank you. Ugh! So... I haven't looked at it yet, but... that should keep you busy for a while. - Yep. - Feel free to work here as long as you want. - You want coffee? - The answer to that question will always be yes. Okay. Hey, you want cream or sugar? Uh, just coffee is fine, thank you. This is from the year he left. All right, here we go. So, where should we get started? Uh, actually, I have to go. Sorry, my, uh, my editor needs a progress report, so I have to go and upload some pictures. But thank you, and, um... I'll call you? Yep. Fine. She told me about you. Maybe we'll sit down and visit. She let me know kind of what's going on... I figured, look, this is something that I know what I'm talking about 'cause I've been there. - You've been there? - Yeah, and back again. - Hey. - Hi. How'd it go with your boss? Uh, yeah, good, good. Yeah, uh... Just, uh... just, uh, working away. Great. Do you care if I sit down? Sure. Go ahead. Thank you. - Hey, um... - Yeah. Who is that guy that Everett is talking to outside? - Do you know him? - Oh, yeah, it's the guy he's been counseling. - Counseling? - Yeah, I'm surprised you didn't figure that out in all your research. - Hmm. - You have a little... Okay, you have a lot of powdered sugar on your face right there. Yeah. Yeah, Everett's been working with the community center. You know, helping these guys through hard times like he went through, says it's his way of giving back. - "Like he'd went through"? - I don't have the full story. But, you know, his family's from here and he was born here. But then he went away for a few years and so... Hey! Oh, careful now. That powdered sugar will take you out. - Mm-hmm. - Uh, I hope you didn't fill up too much, 'cause I saved you the last meat pies of the day. - You have one yet? - Um... Pirogues, yes, sambooseh, sure. But a genuine Louisiana meat pie, I can't say that I've had the pleasure. Good. Jackson, you all right if I steal her away? - Yeah, no, not at all. - All right. Meat pie's gonna be a good walking snack. Walking snack? Where are we going? Down to the bayou. Girls are already there. I'm gonna give you a peek behind the curtain. What's the verdict? Wow. These really are amazing. Ha ha! Made from scratch every day. - How? - Get out of bed, make a cup of coffee. Start on the dough. I mean, how? What goes into them? Oh, a lot of love. I'm gonna show you something that's great for the article. The article, right. This little skiff is soon gonna be a sleigh. The Pere Noel family decorates this bad boy every year. You gonna give us a hand? Do you want me to help? In case you haven't noticed yet, I'm giving you an all-access pass like you're part of the family. Yeah. Sure, yeah. - Dad, can you help me with this a little bit? - Yep. Hey. Decorating not your thing? I don't like the water so much. Do you know how many gators are in there? - Alligators? - Aw, don't worry. Those mean old gators never eat one of Pere Noel's girlsl, they know better. - But I will! - Dad, put me down, Dad! I'll put you down in the water! She's gator bait! She's gator bait! Oh, she escaped. - Saved your life. - Whoa! - I gotcha. - Thank you. I know you're looking for an immersive experience, but trust me, going in the bayou ain't it. Yes. Noted. Well, don't I just miss all the fun. Mom, Campbell almost fell in the water, but Dad saved her. - I sure did. - So that's why you're late. Well, remember, we have that dinner we have to cater across town. - Yeah. - You girls too, so you're going to have to go change. Mom, do we have to? I have so many stories to write down before I forget all the details. Look, it's gonna be a late night, and I really don't want you girls here by yourself. I can watch them. But, Mom, we do not need a babysitter. Oh, I don't babysit. Don't worry. No, but we could have, like, a Christmas sleepover? And I can give you those pictures I took today, so... Yeah... Mom, Dad, please! Yes, okay, fine. Yes. All right, but they gotta be in bed by 10:00. Not a minute later! - You got it. - All right. And you need to go change. I do, yeah. Wow, you look great. - Is that what you're going to wear? - Yes. I mean, ice-cream snowman. It's brilliant. It's the closest we can get to real snow around here, so... Oh! Think he's melting. Oh, here, let me help. Oh, yeah. Um... I think this is jammed. Here, let me see it. - Oh, my God. - Look! Oh, my God! - I still don't appreciate it. - Hair! No! Get off! Okay, smile. Nice! Oh, those are good. So, since I'm the writer in the family, I do the Christmas cards and Mary-Margaret makes the gifts. Wait, you made these? Yeah, it's not a big deal. That's why you're so good with the camera. Like I said, you've got a great eye. Oh... it's whatever. You know it's okay to like things, right? Like photography, for example. Yeah, but it's not cool. I think it's cool! And I have made a career doing it, so... maybe give me that one? Fine. I do like it. But most people will see it as... like a teenage girl, always on her phone, so... Well, maybe you just need a real camera. You're just saying this stuff to be nice. You do this stuff for real. Yeah, but, you know, even when you do it for real, you wonder if you're any good. Like, for instance, I wasn't sure I wanted to take this assignment and come here to Sorrento. - I was nervous. - Really? Sure. I mean, being scared and anxious doesn't just go away because you get older. You just learn to not let those feelings stop you and go after it anyway. And sometimes the stuff that really scares you the most ends up being the best thing that's ever happened. - Deep. - Thanks. Yeah, it was pretty deep. Like, hit this road and it was like... I'm doin' my thing. It was so much fun. Do they know yet? No, still Jennifer. The moment hasn't felt right and I still have so many questions. I feel kind of guilty, and I know I have to tell him, but... Remember, you're in control of how this goes. I know, Dad, but it's nice to hear. Campbell, popcorn's ready! Oh, I gotta go, a movie's starting. I told them about our movie night tradition, and they wanted to do it too, so, um... I miss you both so much. I'll call you later. - Love you. - Miss you, kiddo. I love you, bye. Bye. A merry Christmas to you! I hope you succeeded yesterday. I'm afraid it's not a very pleasant one for you. But will you allow me to ask your pardon? And would you be good enough to put me down? Lord bless my soul. My dear Mr. Scrooge... We're home. Anyone still...? - Not a farthing less, sir. - My dear sir! - I'm afraid there are many backpayments included in it. - My dear Mr. Scrooge! You come round and see me. You will come round? Oh, we will, we will! You're thinking about her, aren't you? More than ever. You think we should wake them up? No, no, no, let them sleep. Hi. Merry Christmas Eve. Brought the coffee this time. And this. Thought it might bring you a little Christmas cheer. Thank you very much. Are you okay? What are you doing here? I brought you the Christmas tree. And the coffee. I mean, what are you doing here in Sorrento? I'm writing a story. You know that. That's not all you're doing, Campbell. What do you mean? You're not here to write a story, you are the story. You're her. You're Everett Bergeron's other daughter. It's true, isn't it? You're Everett's daughter. C-Campbell. Campbell! Hey, Campbell, will you slow down? - You're such a fast walker. - Do you need something? - Yeah, I want to talk to you. - There's nothing to talk about. - It's between me and my dad. - Ah, see, I knew it! Yeah, okay, fine, I'm Everett's daughter. - He doesn't know, does he? - No, he doesn't. I mean, he knows that he has a daughter somewhere, but he doesn't know that I'm... - How do you know? - I'm the town's sacred record keeper. I know all, and you took the file from my office. I looked at the backup... three daughters. - And then I did some digging on the internet. - Some? Okay, I did a lot of digging on the internet, and I put the pieces together. - You're such a nerd. - It takes one to know one, doesn't it? Well, now you know. Here's your file. You better not be following me. Hey, I just wanna know why you're doing this. Because I want to know him. - I want to know the real him. - And what have you learned? Not much. We've been doing all the Pere Noel stuff together and hanging out with the family and we've had talks, sure, but we haven't, you know, sat down and, one-on-one... Okay, so, what's holding you back? Okay, fine, yeah, maybe I'm a little scared. I was scared because I didn't want him to know who I was, and then I was scared because, you know, if he knew, he might not tell me the truth about why he left. And now I'm scared because... you know, I like him. And maybe I don't want to know the truth. He seems like... a good guy. And... I'm so glad that my sisters have a loving and present father, but I just... I... I have so many questions about the past and they're really hard to ask. I think I know someone that can help. So, where do we start? Bit of town history? We were named after Sorrento, Italy, because a German railroad tycoon brought his wife there on their anniversary. Honeymoon, actually. - Nerd. - You know I can hear you? Actually, um, I wanted to ask you about Everett Bergeron? Just background stuff, you know. I know he grew up here. I heard you were friends as kids. Sure were. Thick as thieves. Yeah, he went away after school, and he only came back when his dad got sick and later passed away. That messed up Everett really bad. - How so? - Well, he was broke. And when I say broke, I don't mean money, I... Well, I do mean money, but I also mean that something inside of him was broke. And I know that because at the time, something inside me was broke too. I'd just gotten back from a deployment, and I hit rock bottom. So in a way you two were meant to find each other again. That's exactly right. We were both washing dishes over at old lady Robert's restaurant, and even though it was the worst time in Everett's life, he always had time for me, always. He's the reason I am in the place I am today. Did he ever say anything about that time he was away, any idea what happened? Only that he had to get his life together. He always said he didn't want to be the man his father was. Uh... maybe that last part should be off the record. It's all off the record, don't worry. Okay. Well, fast-forward a bit. He worked his way up on the job and inherited old lady Robert's recipes when she passed away. He started a business, married Jennifer, had two beautiful girls. Between you and me, he's been acting a little different since he was named Pere Noel. He actually tried to turn the honor down. And I've been thinking, maybe the stuff... the stuff with his dad and his family had something to do with it. So, should I talk first, or will you? The suspense is killing me. It's just, I didn't know about his father getting sick and about him wanting to come back or turning down Pere Noel. Do you ever feel like getting more information just makes you more confused? Yeah. But I think you and I both know there's only one way you're gonna find out. By spending time with your dad. All right, merry Christmas. Thank you. Hey, Joe, what are you going for today? Yeah. Yeah. You're right. Five, ten. Thank you, Cindy, merry Christmas to you. Hey, Everett, how you doing up there? Boy, I tell ya, I'm sorry Jennifer took the girls Christmas shopping. - I'm flying solo up here! - Funny you say that. Campbell was just telling me that she wants to learn how the food truck works. - Really? - Yeah, uh-huh. - I sure was. - Well, get up here, Campbell. I could use all the help I can get. - The best research is hands on. - That's true. What are you looking for? - Okay, got it. - See ya, Everett. All right, you be good. Meat? Meat, just regular meat. Okay, that's $4.00. - Okay. - Hey, all right, get comfy. - It's hot in the kitchen here. - Yep. You run the window. Uh, I'll fill the orders. There's your cash box. Four bucks a pie. Hi. - What else you got? - Two meats, two sweets. - Two meats, two sweets. - Thank you, sir. That's for you. Have a merry Christmas. - Hey. - Oh, hey. How's, uh... had fun shopping with the kids? Yeah, I just thought I'd break away and see how Everett was doing. Tout de suite! - See what I did there? - Yeah, that was pretty cool. Hey, Karen, how are you doing? Those two seem to be getting along. Yeah, which is a good thing. Why is that? Well... 'cause Campbell's here all alone, you know, and Christmas, and Everett's like a father. Figure. A father figure. Which is good, you know, 'cause it's Christmas time. Wait, what do you know? I don't know, is there something to know? I think you know there is. I may know something. Thank goodness. I thought I was going to explode keeping that secret. So you're responsible for this? Sorry, I didn't mean to skip you. She didn't count right. Well, I just didn't want Campbell to miss out on something that could be potentially great. Nah, I'm kidding. Come on, now, merry Christmas. I'm gonna need your help. But we have to keep it a secret until Campbell's ready. Deal. Better count her money real quick, 'cause I don't know. You're doing good, though. Oooh! - Thank you. - There you go. Cheers. Good day, thanks for the help. Of course. So, you do this every time? Oh, food truck goes out about twice a week, but at Christmas time, the demand is like you wouldn't believe. Oh, I believe it. Um... I heard something about a secret ingredient? Any chance I might pry it out of you? Well, I could tell ya, but then I'd have to feed you to the gators. Sorry, that's a Bergeron family secret. Yeah. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? We haven't had the chance to do that yet. - Now's a good time. - Okay. Um... Well, how did you meet your wife, Jennifer? Oh, uh... at the supermarket, if you can believe it. She was a cashier, and I was making a run for a restaurant I was working for. Oh, old lady Robert's? I forget sometimes I'm talking to a reporter. Well, anyway, they said, "Bring back as many onions as you can," so there I am pushing a cart full of nothing but onions up to her register, and, I mean, it was weird for sure, and we laughed about it. And then she threw in a chocolate candy bar. For free. And she said... "We all need to treat ourselves every now and again." Next day, I go back to the store, buy her a candy bar, ask her out on a date. And the rest, as they say, is history. Oh, speaking of history, I heard there were a handful of years, uh, that you lived in Texas. That's where I live. I... I was born in Houston, but, um, we moved to Dallas when I was a kid. - Really? - Yeah. Everett, I, um... I-I was wondering if you would teach me how to make a meat pie sometime. Me and the girls are way ahead of you. - Great. - You'll see. Good. Um, "We all need to..." - Treat ourselves. - "...treat ourselves..." - Every now and again. - "...every now and again." - Words to live by. - You do still? - Oh, yeah. - ♪ And I wonder if you ♪ Very sweet. -♪ Could make My dreams come true ♪ ♪ And spend it ♪ Here with me All right, Campbell. What do you know about meat pies? I understand there's a meat component and a pie component. - And they're delicious. - The best. - Yes. - Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - Baking boot camp? - Baking boot camp. - I'll get the aprons. - Oh. - It's a real thing. - It's a thing, okay, yeah. - For you. - Thank you. Thank you. Lookie there. - All right. - Beautiful. Not too tight. Hu-hu-humm! All right. First things first. - Let's talk dough. - Ooooh! Ohh! Prep your surface. Good, good, good. - Nice and even. - Now the dough. Grab a baseball. Perfect, just like that. Okay, now, let's get that thing flat. - That's a shaper. - Oh. Wisht! - Voilà! - Hey! Time to fill 'em up! Ooh, is this secret ingredient time? Family only, remember the rules. Okay! Moment of truth... Mmm! - Ten! - Okay! You couldn't have made this better if you were one of us. Oh, let's take a photo. We can generate some buzz for Christmas Eve tomorrow. - Like that? Gr-Grab on. - Smile! - How's that? - Perfect. - Good? - And smile! Ha ha! Good. Perfect. All right. - Mm-hmm. - Okay, let's go compose the ultimate post for mom. - I'm taking this with me! - Okay. Yeah, don't you worry about a thing. - We'll clean up, yeah. - Thanks, Dad! Hey, thanks for sticking around. Appreciate it. Uh, I know it's late, but, um, I have a few more questions for you if you don't mind? - Sure. - Why don't we talk about, um... you being Pere Noel? - Yeah, sure. - He's sort of the ultimate father figure, right? Yeah. You could say that. How does it feel to be honored in that way? Well, uh, I mean, I've had a... a difficult family life. You know, my own father, he... he wasn't the greatest, and I made some mistakes concerning my family, but, you know, now I would do anything to make things right. Anything. Huh. Now, listen, we are talking about Pere Noel the character, the festival, all that, right? Yeah, it's a human interest piece, and, um, you're a very interesting human. Okay. It's just that I have done a little digging. Really? What did you find out? Well, this is a sight. Where are the other two little elves that live here? I hope they didn't leave you both all this mess. They're upstairs composing the ultimate post. Well, don't mind me. I just brought some things for the truck. No, we were just wrapping up. I'm sure Campbell's gotta get back to the cottage and work on that article. Yeah, yes, yep. Lots to catch up on. Thank you for a great evening. Mm-hmm. I'll see you tomorrow. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, Mom, do you have a minute? Sure. What's going on? Well, uh... I learned how to make meat pies tonight. That's a first. And I'm heading back to the cottage to write my article. Hey, um... why did Everett leave? Campbell, you know this. Yeah, sure. Uh, just... just walk me through it. We were young and Everett wasn't ready to be a father. I mean, I wasn't ready to be a mother either, but it just hit him hard, and when you were two, he lost his job, and he was a wreck. Anyway, after he left, it was just like he didn't want to be found. So I stopped trying. You don't think maybe he wanted to come back? Well, if he wanted to come back, he would have. Why? Did he say something? No. No, not officially. I'm still trying to get the truth out of him. - You want my two cents? - Sure. He's never going to spill his guts to a journalist, but he might tell his daughter everything she wants to know. Oh, I forgot my camera back at the house. Can I call you back? - Sure. Love you. - I love you too. Everett, wait, wait! Everett, just talk to me! Talk to me. Jennifer, I know that your heart is in the right place, but having Campbell here digging into my past, it's too much. Okay, yes. I'm sorry, I really am. But maybe it's a good thing? It could be cathartic. Look, I'm only trying to do what's best for you. I know. I know, and... I love you for it. I ever tell you about the last time I saw her? No. After I was away for a few years, I started to think, I'm on my way to being a better man, better father, so I thought, well, I should look her up. So I researched Alice's school, and it turns out they're having a Christmas pageant. I thought, well, that's the perfect time. So I drove back to Texas all night and I stood in the back of the auditorium and... I watched the whole thing. And... she was just the cutest thing you've ever seen. So after the show, I thought I'd go talk to her, but her... her mom and this other man get their first, and he gives her roses and she jumps into his arms. They were so happy, Jennifer. It was... it was the perfect family. Then what happened? I left. But I never stopped loving her. Even if I have to love her from a distance... she'll always be right here. ♪ Christmas lights ♪ See them shine ♪ In the eyes ♪ Of a child ♪ Let them shine Hi, merry Christmas Eve. What can I get you? How are my two favorite tastemakers? Hungry. You're awfully quiet. What's up? Just... when tonight is over, you've got to go home, right? Well, she has work, Amelia. She can't just stay here forever. Well, I know that, but... Well, that doesn't mean I'm leaving, not really. I mean, we still have Christmas breakfast, and then we can video-chat and text, and I'm only an hour away by plane. So... I can come back and visit. - You promise? - Yeah. - You'll come back? - I promise. In the meantime, I have a very important mission for you guys. I need to go help your mom with my new skills in the truck, and I need someone to go around and take some pictures for my article. Are you guys up for it? - Wait, for real? - Yeah. - You can count on us. - Okay, good. Here. Be careful. - Yes! - -Come on, Mary-Margaret. Here. And needless to say, he never went caroling again. Everything all right, there? Um, yeah. I'm just, um... just thinking. Anything I can help with? Not unless, uh, you know how to tell the man you're writing a story about that you're his daughter. You're gonna tell him? Yeah, it's, uh... it's time. I don't know why you did it, you know, uh, finding me, and, uh, asking me here and helping me through the week. But, um... thank you... from the bottom of my heart. Well, you know, you don't need a reason to bring more love into the world. Ladies, we're out of meat pies. Need some more. Excuse you, we were having a moment here. You know what? Why don't you take it easy, go walk around the party, and I can handle things here? Okay. Have fun. Thank you. You're welcome. All right, so, what are you going to tell him? You are just as bad as Jennifer. - It's a big moment, Campbell. - I know it's a big moment. I'm trying not to freak out, and the two of you are making it worse. Ah, so what you're saying is, you need a distraction. - Yes, please. - Hmm. Do you know how to two-step? - No? - No. - Really good. - Yeah. Oh, wow, you think you're really smooth, huh? I promise you I did not know it was going to be a slow song. - I am so sorry. - So, you don't want to dance? - No, I didn't say that. - I'm messing with you, Jackson. Take my hand. Never had a Christmas quite like this one, I must say. Yeah? Where was your last one? Uh, I was about a hundred miles outside of Ulaanbaatar, learning how the Mongolian herders keep their animals alive during the winter. - So a very normal one. - Yes, yes. Mm-hmm. Don't worry, this one is... much better. Yeah, way less chance of frostbite here. I'm pretty sure I read every book on the outside world past the parish lines, and I've never been past them. I can't believe that. How? My family's been here for generations. My parents had me later in life, and I'm pretty sure they don't want me to leave. - Hmm. - Follow in the old family footsteps. Become Pere Noel, work for the city. Settle down, essentially do everything that they did. I mean, I know it's none of my business, but I think your family would want you to be happy and leave Sorrento, if that's what you want, you know, see the world outside of your books. Yeah. Maybe. So, okay, where would you go if you could be anywhere? That's a very good question. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Um... Where are you going next? Um... my editor was talking about me doing a story in Morocco. - Morocco? - Mm-hmm. That's where I want to go. Campbell, come on! Oh, it's starting. Are you coming? Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas! Now, you know I'm not one for big speeches. It occurred to me that Christmas happens during the darkest and coldest time of the year. And here in Louisiana, that's about 50 degrees. But with our care for each other, we cast off that chill. We illuminate the darkness with fire and celebration. So it's only fitting that we would ask the family of our newest Pere Noel, Everett Bergeron, to join us in the tradition of calling out the Christmas alligators to welcome him back to Sorrento and kick off Christmas. Ladies, please. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Okay. - Wait, what is it again? - It's like the book. - Oh! Okay. Okay, okay, okay. - You girls ready? - Yes. - All right, here we go. Ha, Gaston! Ha, Tiboy! Ha, Pierre an' Alcee'! Gee, Ninette! Gee, Suzette! Celeste an' Renee! Allons-y! There it is! Merry Christmas, y'all! Merry Christmas! Happy holidays! Yohhhh! Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, y'all! Merry Christmas! Hey-hey! Hey there, my girls! Merry Christmas. Some candy canes for my favorite girls. That's right, let's get this Christmas party started! This time of night it's customary for Pere Noel to make a little toast. I'm sure Mayor Thomas has already given a fine speech. Exactly. But since it's tradition, I feel obliged to carry the torch, so to speak. Now, this year you've chosen me to be Pere Noel, "the ultimate father figure," as a friend of mine once said. Because at Christmas, you know, as parents, we're busier than ever, aren't we? You know, it's a time of year when our love for them really shines. It's a time when we remember just how special that bond is. I haven't always been a perfect man or perfect father, but having kids has been the greatest honor of my life, and if I ever accomplish anything on this Earth, it will have been that, so I would like to raise a toast to my family, my girls, my everything... and to you and yours, wherever they may be. Cheers! Cheers! Whoo, whoo! Cheers, you guys. - Dad! - Hey, how are y'all? - How are ya? - You did great, Dad. Merry Chr... Thank you. I practiced in the garage. I didn't want to tell anybody. You can't have any of that. Okay. Okay, uh... Dad. No. That's so strong. Uh... Okay, okay, Everett. I wanted to say something to you and... Hey. What are you doing all the way out here? Eh, nothing. Are you rehearsing? No. Maybe. Okay, fine. You and Jennifer got in my head. And... that speech from Everett... This is just such an important night, and... it's my last chance to tell him before I leave tomorrow, and I don't want to mess it up. So speak from the heart. Listen, I was wrong, okay? Don't think so much. Now you tell me. Campbell... who wouldn't love you? I just... Once I tell him, everything's going to change... For the better. Yeah, I hope so. Jackson, you were supposed to bring her back. I am now the rescue party for the rescue party. So, Campbell, there's sort of a lull over there. I think now might be a good time. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Yeah. I'm ready. - Cool. - You got this. Yep. Why am I so nervous? Because you love her too. Aw. - Ooh, hey there. - Hi. All right, so... what do you think of Sorrento? Uh, compared to... London, Paris? Yeah, it's a special place, that's for sure. I'm sad I have to leave tomorrow. We feel the same way. Got enough for your article? Uh, actually, I was hoping to talk to you, you know, kid to Pere Noel. Uh... yeah, of course. - What's up? - Um... So, Everett, uh... tonight in your speech, you said that being a father was the greatest honor of your life. - Yeah. - Yeah. And, um... Dad, Campbell! We ran into some fellow reporters all the way from Mississippi! - Oh! - Pere Noel, if we could just get a few photos of you and your family. - Do you mind? - Um... Then we'll finish our chat later? - Yeah. Yeah, okay. - Okay. - Girls, what is all this? - Oh, regional exposure, Mom. Come on, get in the picture. Yeah, actually, if you can stand right next to Pere Noel. Oh, yeah. - Campbell. - Oh, no, this is great. Just the family's all we need. All right. Everybody look here. All right, get together and say, "Hot chocolate!" Hot chocolate! Yeah, the mayor did a good job. So sorry, I'll be right back. Hey, slow down! Where are you going? - I need to go home. - Okay, well then, give me a minute, I'll go with you. No, I'm... I'm going home. I'm sorry. This was a huge mistake. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What happened? - What did he say? - I didn't tell him, okay? - Oh, Campbell. - And I ask that you please don't either. I just... I don't know what I was thinking. I have a family back in Dallas, a great family, actually, and, you know, maybe Everett not coming back and not changing things was for the best. He left things alone, and maybe I need to do the same thing. Campbell. Campbell! Will you please just wait? You need to let me go, Jackson. This is your family, your choice, but you're leaving behind such a gift. It's so much more complicated than that. Of course it's complicated, it's family. I get it. But they obviously care about you. Maybe if you just told them the truth. Maybe not all family is meant to be. Yes. But can you honestly spend the rest of your life knowing what you left behind here? Campbell, hi, it's me again. Uh, merry Christmas. We, uh, missed you last night, and I was just calling to see if you're all right and to let you know that the offer for Christmas breakfast still stands. Um, give us a call. Bye. She'll call. I don't know, maybe she finished her story. I just feel bad for the girls. I mean, they really took a liking to her. I did too. I mean, do you really think she would leave without saying goodbye? Hey, it's Jackson. - In the kitchen. - Is it her? Is she here?! Merry Christmas, Bergeron family. - Oh, it's just you. - Be nice. It's okay, I get it. Campbell was a very special person, I'd be sad too. Luckily for you, though, you don't have to be. - Oh! Hey! - Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Hello! - Hello. - See? I told everyone you wouldn't leave without saying goodbye. - Never! - We were worried you ran off. And miss all this? No way. I just couldn't come to Christmas morning without getting some presents, and, uh... my story is far from over. Oh, and if anyone's wondering if the big-box store out on I-10 is open at 2 a.m. on Christmas Eve... it is. Come on, now. Let's eat. Give me those! - Oh! - Merry Christmas. Thank you. All right, girls, put those under the tree, and, uh, yeah, Jackson, grab a seat. Campbell, grab a seat. - Juice! - -All right, grab one and pass it down. - Thank you. - Gravy's on the side. They're beautiful! Thank you. - You're welcome. - Okay, so, last but not least... Okay. Uh... Mary-Margaret. Oh, for me? Yes. For your budding influencer career. Seriously? Oh, my goodness. I love it. Thank you! Oh! I thought you might. Thank you so much. Amelia. A place to put your thoughts. I have a lot of thoughts. Uh, okay, and, Jennifer. - One for you. - Oh, wow, me too? - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. It's our saying! Yeah, well, he shared your story with me, and I was... inspired. Oh, thank you so much. Look at that. You're good at this. That is so sweet! And, um... Uh... Everett, yours is the only one I didn't buy. You can't be. She... my baby girl had darker hair and a little crooked tooth. Yeah, right in the front. Alice? I should have told you the truth sooner, but I needed... I thought... Everett. Campbell, I'm so sorry. Mama, what... what was it? - Is she crying? - It's okay. No, it's fine. I'm fine. I just, um... - Campbell. - We should get going anyway. I... I have loved every minute of my time here, and all of you are, uh... Wait, hang on. Don't go. What's this? It's a gift, for you. When I left, I thought I was protecting you. I thought it was the right thing to do, and I wanted you to know it and to know how much I missed you. And so I sent some letters. But we moved and we changed our name. - Yeah. - Yeah. And, uh, when the letters came back, I... bought a notebook, and I wrote in that instead, everything that I was thinking, everything that I was feeling, all the regret and sorrow and apologies and... I wrote every day. It's a lifetime of days spent missing you and loving you. I thought you didn't want me. No. Never. I am so sorry. I just... I can't believe that you're really here. I can't believe it, either. Jennifer, you were in on this, weren't you? Yes. But I had help from Jackson. What can I say, I love to keep the town family records complete. Uh-huh. Um, could somebody please explain what's going on? Yeah, why is everyone crying? Well, uh, girls, uh, years ago, I had another daughter, your older sister. And Campbell... - Wait, she's our sister? - I knew it! - You did not! - I had a hunch. Oh, a hunch! Okay, so I'm not the oldest? I guess not. Wait, so if you're our sister, then that means... That's a great idea. The secret ingredient. We only share it with family. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Oh, I gotta get a piece of this. Come on, now. Oh, Jackson, come in. Come in. - Come on in! Come on! - All right. All right, merry Christmas on 3. 1, 2, 3! Merry Christmas! Yeah, that's a good one. Ever since that fateful Christmas, I get asked a lot of things. "What did it feel like to meet your father?" "Are your sisters really that cool?" "What made you go back on Christmas morning?" And "Is Jackson as cute as he sounds?" And all those are fair questions, but the question I get asked the most often is, "What happened next?" What happened after my first Louisiana family Christmas? Well, that's easy.
