(MultiCom jingle) (ominous string music) On our planet, hundreds of species of animal, plant, and insect life protect themselves by using their ability to change their color or shape, to blend into their surroundings. Many other species are capable of killing their prey by use of electric shocks, acids, or poisons. Of the millions of planets capable of supporting life in the universe, it is a certainty that hundreds of thousands have developed species of life with characteristics similar, and possibly more dangerous than those found on our own planet earth. It is also a certainty that not all alien encounters will be friendly! (whooshes) (clicks) (eerie hollow voice whispers) - [Eerie Voice] Dark. (eerie hollow voice whispers) (dog barks) (eerie voice whispers) (disorienting rising music) (roars) (screams) (rock n roll music) - (laughs) Alright lovey, I'll see what I can do. Call me Saturday. - [Man] Red nine, black 10. - [Woman] The game is called solitaire young man. Only one can play. - How'd you know I was young. - Your hands, unwrinkled. Your profession, actor. - You're incredible. - You haven't found a girl yet, perhaps a boy might interest you? - Hey, I'm not that way. - Give yourself time, ambition can work miracles. - That's a funny line, you know you aught to have your own comedy hour. - Go ahead, speak your mind, you think I can get you a job in films? No. I'm only. (disorienting tone) - Because you know where all the bodies are buried. - You do understand, there's no way I can save you. - Save me? First you can't help me, now you can't save me. - Go away from me, now. (police siren blazes) - Take it back to the station. - What are you doing here, you're on your lunch break? - Neighbors reported a suspicious person. - Now they wake up huh? - Hey they've been reporting a suspicious person around here for the next month. - Yeah, you didn't find out nothing new? - Naw, stats hasn't come up with anything and national says no known MO. - You didn't expect it to be easy did ya, I mean really? - [Man] It happened sometime last night Roy. The bodies at the morgue, it's just terrible. They need you to identify her. Roy, Roy are you their? - [Operator] Sir, your time is up. - [Man] Roy are you alright? - [Operator] Sir it will be another 25 cents for three minutes. - [Man] Roy can you hear me? - [Operator] 25 cents please. - [Man] Operator will you get off the line, this is an emergency. - [Operator] I'm sorry sir your time is up. (clicks) (dial tone plays) - That's right, I'll do it 'til I get it right. - That is the way you learn, why do you think I sent you to Pasadena on those road shows? Why do you think I sent you for those swim suit shows? - It's hard to describe how fulfilling rose gardens can be. - Zoe you've been with us exactly six months. - Look at the ratings. - Well of course, half the male population of LA is staying up all night trying to figure out how to get in your pants. - Thank you. That's their problem, mine is to get a story. - Alright so a girl got murdered, what else is new? - Beheaded, mutilated. Awe Sherm I want to do this story, I want to write my own copy. - Why? - Because this is the first chance I have to do something I believe in. - Rather see brains on the sidewalk, rather that than those swimsuit shows. - I want this opportunity Sherm. - Look you can get all you need from those interviews. - Are you saying I don't have to go to the morgue? I'm doing this story, and that means I start at the beginning. - Mr. Warner. (gags) Sorry, sorry. (coughs) - [Loud Speaker] Mr. Cass call Captain Speers office. Dr. Robinson report to pathology. - Warner. I didn't connect, how do you do? Maybe you should talk to Herman. - What do you got? - Not much yet. - Let's talk. - Alright, 10 minutes Relic's House. - What's with you two? - I set him up for manslaughter. He's been out for three years. - Who'd he kill. - Guy in the sack with his wife. (laughs) How'd he take it back there? - Pretty good considering she was his only child. Hey I didn't want to go back and look at her either. - Maybe we should give him a medal right? - Hey come on Dave will you, he's paid his dues. - Hey, screw him! - [Zoe] So tragically the too brief life of Shelly Warner came to an abrupt end. And perhaps ironically, and that her father paid a heavy debt for an act of violence and even today under the name of Steve Dupree, is a successful author trading in violence. Jim. - Thank you Zoe, now after this brief timeout, we'll be back with Ken Minyard's sports. Tonight, a look at all the action-- (clicks) - [Creepy Whispering Voice] Darkness. - Sports, don't they know it will happen soon again? - Are you sure about this baby? - No sweat sugar, no I make my rounds and we got us all night. - Honey, you ain't paying for all night now. - You try all that now and you ain't ever gonna want to leave. - Aw sugar you need to quit it (laughs) - (laughs) look at that. - Now watch it now. Aw, say baby you got a cigarette? - Oh I don't smoke, but if it's gonna cause you to have fits baby, you know you can get some around the corner. - Super, I'll be right back. - I gotta get started on my rounds, but I'll leave the door unlocked. So you come right on in when you come back. - Sure baby no sweat. - Oh wee (laughs). (electrical buzz) (electrical buzz) (electrical buzz) What the hell? Woman? (crashes) (creepy musical effects) Damn woman. You playing games with me? You better come on out. I ain't funning with you. Hey. Come on now. Where you at woman? What the devil? You in here? Thought I told you now, you better come on out. I ain't playing no more. (creepy whispers) (growls) (lasers zing) (explodes) (casual diner music) - You can pick up her affects in my office. I know they're probably your ex-wife's. She wasn't raped. She had a lot of money still in her purse. No needle marks on her, so she was okay there. Do you have any idea who she was shacking up with? - I loved her. She didn't deserve to have her face torn to pieces just because she alone at night on one of your streets. - My streets, my fault huh? Nevermind about her old man who wasn't around when she needed him. (coughs) How long has it been since you've seen her? - A month we got lunch at the beach. - Did she say anything about problems or kinky friends? - You're Steve Dupree aren't you? - No. - Come on yes you are, I've seen your picture. - Where? - On the back of my book. - Hey buddy come on beat it, we're talking business. - You're so articulate. - One of my two or three million faithful readers. - So you're Steve Dupree huh? You do have the court's permission to use an alias don't ya? - I don't need anybody's permission. - You must have learned how in jail, see I did you a favor. - The only favor I want you to do me is to find the murderer of my daughter. - Maybe we'll get lucky. - Lucky, uh uh, not good enough. You're gonna work you're ass off. When I see your not doing it I'm gonna write letters to the newspapers and sign it, Irate Tax Payer. - If I even see you Warner I'm gonna nail you for interfering with an officer in the performance of his duty, you got that? - I'm not gonna interfere, I'm just gonna be there. - Well you've been warned officially mister. - Mooney telephone. - That's an order, disappear. (coughs) Mooney, where? On my way. (police siren blares) - Well, how was it? - It was good, it's good relax. Now what's the father like? - I couldn't reach him. - That could be tough. - Jim, violence was my angle. Dupree makes his living off of violence. I read one of his so called novels, it was nothing but blood and guts and viscous stories of the occult, that's it. - It was still rough on Dupree. Kenny, we'll be right back. - [Director] Stand by, 30 seconds. - I'm sorry for his daughter. - You saw the girl? Hey look Zoe you can always go back to doing fashions in Beverly Hills. - Nothing is sending my back to the minor leagues. - Either you tell us now or later, downtown. - Honest I didn't see nothing, I was just gonna bring him some cigarettes. - Don't let him bother you Crystal, you tell me. You too were having your own little ice show weren't you? - I told you I didn't see nothing. - Downtown, get her out of here. Officer, you get a statement from her or I'll book her. Cigarettes, for Christ's sake. - He was doing a number in the ice house for the old guy. Ah you people here, you see anything, hear anything? Volunteers as usual. - Come off it pig. - You got a problem? - Yeah, when are you guys gonna show up on time? - You, Mr. Irate citizen, you got a name? - I don't have to tell you my name, but you gotta give us some protection. - Maybe you'd like the badge. Maybe you'd like to be in charge, would ya? - Maybe, cause it looks like to me you couldn't find your butt with both hands. - Now you cool it son. - Go on, bust a nigger for getting mouthy when a killer's loose. - I want to tell you something, when we get him, I'm gonna come back here looking for you and you're gonna repeat to me what you just said tonight. You think you could do that? - Sure honky. (laughs) (crows yells) (tires squeal) (ominous piano music) - [Operator] Six officers on OK seven. What office do you want? (engine starts) (train horn blows) - Another girl Mooney? - I don't have to tell you nothing. - You're not talking to some kid Mooney, you're talking to the father of a murdered girl. - What do you got the scanner for? - Everything you hear I hear. Everyplace you go I'm going. - You're trying to make me look bad aren't you? You're trying to make the department to look bad. - You guys don't need any help. - It won't take me long to find out who your zookeeper is mister. - I'm not on parole Mooney. I'm a decent citizen. Last week I gave lecture at UCLA. Mooney, another girl? - Read the paper Mr. Steve Dupree. - Dave, this lady, she wants to talk to us. Her name's De Renzy. - I see you've marked where the murders have occurred. - Yeah what can we do for you Mrs. De Renzy? - De Renzy is all you need. I'm here about the murders. - What about them? - I'm your only hope of solving them. - She thinks she's the only one who can stop the killer. - I said nothing of the kind. No one can stop it. It will die, but if you are alert you'll be there to capture this killer before he decapitates half of the city. - Who will die? - He's a young ambition Aryan. His death will be felt by his parents, perhaps a young woman or two, that's all. - Name? - I haven't the faintest idea. - (sighs) Why me? Another night it'll be coming lady now you're gonna get to it or get out. - I met him at a part on Courtney Floyd's yacht, the Sapphire Sea II. Perhaps his name is on the guest list. - Occupation? - Parties I suspect. And fancying himself another Barrymore. No I take that back, he wouldn't even know the name. His idea would be some TV actor. - But why is he gonna die? - My dear man, I saw it happen. He was standing near me in the fading light, and as I looked up to him, I saw his face distorted in the death rows. I knew he would die that way. - So the killer is stalking this young actor kid right? - I didn't say that. Quite amazing how you people keep reaching conclusions I never even suggested. - What are you talking about then? - He will die. It is fate that his path will intersect with that of the killer. Find him, follow him, wait. - De Renzi, you don't suppose you could conjure up a picture of the killer huh? - If so, I shall speak to someone less rude. (laughs) - Here's something to brighten up the rest of your day. Mangler claims second victim. - Thank you. Put these with the rest of the trash. (phone rings) - Yeah, this is Warner here. I got your message. Listen, if you can find my ex-wife, your client, between polo and sailing, you tell her it's too late. There's nothing she can do, there's nothing we want her to do. Listen champ, if there's one group of people that fails to impress me it's lawyers. Yeah, well, I think a high mass at St. Patrick's is over doing it don't you? I'm having her cremated. (ominous instrumental music) - Newspapers are really doing a job on it. - Yeah well Moss says we're not doing a job on the guy. There is no sensationalizing, interview and report, that's it. - I know, I know, we're back to the rose gardens. - You've got that right. - Is that why you're here? Babysit? - Zoe this is your interview, it's all yours. - Does the family know we're coming? - Yeah. - You know it's funny? - What, what do you mean? - I mean why stop at just one killing a night, why not go on a rampage and kill everything in sight until you're done? - Yeah, it's like the guy really knows what he's doing. Like he's actually got a plan. - Yeah. - Gentlemen, I'm certain you know that this is the epidermis. Now that's two to four layers thick, depending on which part of the body you're looking at. We have blood vessels, we have. - Well gentlemen, thank you for joining us. - Now, that's normal skin. What I want to show you now is what we discovered underneath the fingernail of the first victim. Okay now, and I don't want to get too technical with you gentlemen but look, you probably know that what we have here is an increase of fibroid glass. The cells flatter. The fibrinogen, completely deranged. And one final note, slide please, no color. Which means a total absence of blood vessels. - Doctor could you make a guess as to the part of the body? - I could make a wild guess, but it would be wild and useless. - Is that the only thing you found under the fingernail. - It's the only substance I found under the fingernail. - Just under one fingernail right? - Right. - Flesh right? - What are you getting at Bresler? - Maybe it was something she ate sir. - If she ate that, we better find that restaurant and condemn it. (laughs) - Want to go back on the street dummy? - It's just like a pizza. - Pizza on you. - Any guess about race? - No you can't tell that. - Well I think you people could tell us whether or not he was black or white or yellow or whatever. - Gray. - What? - It's gray. - Gray, our mangler's a zombie. - Mangler, zombie? I don't want to hear those two words again, do you understand? Manglers, zombies, that's all we need! Alright, go ahead doctor. - Victims, white female, black male. No sexual assault, their heads faces. - What about the faces? - Well whether it was planned or an afterthought, there was a symbolic attempt-- - Wait a minute doctor you mentioned afterthought, you mean it bothers to think? - Well feel, if he or it does feel, it might feel a sense of guilt and leave something behind so that we can find him and punish him. - And you want us to sit still while he piles up bodies to set up a pattern. - Well whatever it is gentlemen, he's inhumanely strong. Vicious. - I'm afraid all you can do is put more men out and warn people not to go out at night. - Warn people? Oh no, you press a panic button and every night this will go out of it's mind. - If he kills again tonight or tomorrow night or the night after that you'll have no choice. - Okay, what's been seen or heard in this room will not go out. The media is not gonna get a hold of anything. It will turn this city into a disaster area. Okay it's starting to get dark so let's get this show on the road. I want this city turned inside out and upside down. Garages, old buildings, everything. He's got to be holed up somewhere. Alright let's go, hit the streets! Mooney. About an hour ago I got a telephone call. It was from the father of the Warner girl. I didn't talk to him, and I'm not going to, but he's already starting to put pressure on Mooney. I don't like pressure, when I get it, I pass it on. You got it, got it? - Yeah. (ominous instrumental music) - Thank you. You cold? - Little bit. - You should wear a sweater. - My boss won't let us, he says it's bad for business. (police radio dispatch speaks) - How old are you? - Almost 18. - You go to school? - Are you a cop or something? - No, why? - My dad says I shouldn't talk to strangers. He says it isn't safe. - You're dad's smart. - It's all these killings he's afraid of. - Aren't you afraid? - Not really. - Well you should be. - Yeah. - [Zoe] And no threats at all, no one who might of wanted to harm your husband? - [Woman] No. - [Zoe] Sherm you can't just listen to it, I'd like you to see it. - Take out the monitors and we'll run it online. (beeps) - And no threats at all, no one who might have wanted to harm your husband? - No, nothing. He worked very hard. He loved to coach the children at the Y. And he was very active in church. I can't understand in my mind what kind of devil would do this to my husband. - [Zoe] Final rights for Henry Lydell, second victim of murder in Santa Monica in two nights, will be held later this week. This is Zoe Owens, KFVI News. - I don't know if I care for that, what kind of devil. - Well neither do I but she makes a valid point. - Jim? - Professional Moss. - Run it. - [Sherm] Any more murders, we'll report them. No more interviews, I want to become involved. - Hey wait a minute, who issued a gag order? - You just keep reporting, that's all. - Police, they can't do that Sherm, the public has a right to know the facts. - Let the lawyers say that. - The newspapers are already calling him the mangler. - Zoe, we aren't a newspaper. - Moss, we are not sensationalism. - Exactly, but the killers is. He keeps tearing off heads, and we keep talking about it, it'll be lynch time if they ever catch the guy. We are not into freedom of the press. If there's any more murders we'll report it, and it's your story exclusively, but we will not showboat it. Not as gravestone, Miss Pasadena Rose garden, you understand? - Um, I'm not gonna be part of this one ciao. - Alright I'll walk you to your car. - Forget it. - Oh now come on, look Zoe. The only thing printed on stone is that I'm walking you to your car. Now look, he's been seen in Hollywood tonight, and several other places. I want you to remember you're reporting this, and not going out chasing him. - Him? - Him, her, King Kong! I don't want you to be involved with him. - I'll be careful. I know the ropes Sherm, I had a very good teacher. - You know, I'm sorry I had to lay down the law like that. - Apologizing makes it worse. - Oh, well I'm sorry again. I wish they had some more lights down here. - What's a matter, afraid of the dark? - No, scared of what's in it. (screams) (gasps) (laughs) - Real cute, I am scared stiff and your-- - Well so am I, so am I (laughs). There we are. - Thanks. (creepy whispers) That's twice. (knocks) (engine rumbles) (creepy whispers) (screams) (electric buzz) (ominous disorienting music) (creepy whispers) (lightly ominous music) - How you doing, sit down. - I tried to call you. I'm very sorry about your daughter. - Thank you. You write your own copy? - Yes I did this time. - If we were both liberated, I'd knock you on your ass. - I'll tell you what, I'll run the tape for you and you can judge for yourself if I said anything in poor taste. - Poetic justice that I trade in violence. - I said ironically. - Yeah but you meant poetic justice. - I meant what I said. - What do you know? - Know? - About what you can't report on the air? - Nothing, the police are handling it. They're working around the clock. - Yeah I know that. I have an old friend working on the case. - Thank you Mr. Warner, have a good evening. - You forgot your drink. - Thank you. - Take care of yourself, maybe I'll se you again huh. - Maybe. (grunts) - That's another one on the house Max. - I couldn't beat you for nothing man. But someday I'm gonna own this place man. - The day that happens, I'll resort to this. - Oh man, this is some beauty, put it back. - Think about tonight, Tony and me are going crazy. - He's got one too? - 12 gauge with a double odd buck. See I walk, and Tony follows me in the van, and sooner or later. - Man, that thing's been tearing up people man. He's gotta be a big dude. - Man he can be 10 feet tall, but with a 357 Magnum, I'll splatter him from here to the beach. (laughs) - Hey, happy hunting's there amigo. What can I do for you lovely's? - [Woman] I'm ready for another. - [Barkeep] Oh you're always ready for another one flow. (organ rock music) (ominous music) (creepy whispers) (roars) (screams) (crunches) (ominous instrumental music) (horse nays) (groans) - You are both young and a little wild, this time he has the upper hand, next time it will be different. - That you can bet on. - Anger does not become you. Have patience, he'll do as your require. - If I can find him. - Patience, he will return, soon. (grunts) - Who are you? - I am De Renzy. There has been another killing. (ominous string music) - No witnesses, no clues, all that blood. He's gotta wash it off someplace. Hey Mooney, I'm talking to you. - Yeah excuse me Captain, I want to take a closer look at these people. - About to go over the edge. - Yeah - Scared sheep. - With a wolf around. - Why don't we tell them we've got a suspect in custody. - Oh great that will last until another head comes off. - I checked every coo coo's nest in the state, I'm gonna try national. - If we don't come up with something, I'm gonna have to ask for the national guard. - It's gonna make us look like Keystone cops. - Ah, we couldn't look any worse than we do now, if you're worried about how you look, come up with something. - I'm doing everything I can, Captain. - Well it's not good enough, Mooney. - Mooney, isn't that your buddy. - Yeah. - That guy just don't give up does he? (crowd chants and screams) - My people are furious. Last night when the monster was claiming his third victim, there were at least a dozen police officers assigned to harass us! - Harass you? - Yes, an unnatural creature is stalking the streets, and we're being persecuted. (police siren blares) - I don't get it, maniac loose on the streets, and we got a shut down a demonstration. - Just part of their scheme that's all. - What do you mean? - Just another chance for the media to make us look like a bunch of bums. - Yeah well this young doll ain't gonna make me look like a bum. (crowd chants) - Thank you very much Mr.-- - It's gonna go on night after night, can't you understand the city's not safe after dark! Can't you understand that! - And that's the story of today's demonstration. This is Zoe Owens, KFVI News. - Turn it off huh, turn it off! - Peter run it, I said run it. I'm sorry I didn't get your name sir. - This channel sucks. - What's your deal about that skin changer, you trying to tear up the city? - I think the killer's doing that don't you. - Alright, alright, turn it off. - Who the hell are you? - I'm Sherman Moss, head of news. - Well get her out of here. - The american way, freedom of the press, free country. - Every crackpot in town is already reporting open graves. - Well what's your theory? - That were not gonna have to stick a stake through his heart. Just a basic bullet between the eyes. - .38 caliper justice? - Listen to me sister, nobody dead ever killed again. You tell that to your playmates of yours. (ominous instrumental music) (creepy whispers) - Did I scare you? Another couple of minutes and I would have caught you in your act. - I beg your pardon. - No apology, it's my fault. I have a tendency to walk around with my head down. - Miss much? - Oh no. Say uh, what do you do in your spare time? - Oh the usual things. - Alone? - Sometimes. - Could I interest you in a drink? - Maybe. - Any special place you'd like to go? - I have an aversion to nobodies and crowds. - Oh, well I got the perfect place. - Alright, I'll follow you. - Okay. - In sports tonight, Rob Carew, the Minnesota Twins first basemen who's .388 batting average en route to a sixth batting title, matched the highest in the majors in 20 years. Was named the American League's most valuable player Wednesday in the most diversified voting in the ballots history. In basketball (clicks). (ominous instrumental music) (wind blows) (creepy whispers) (roars) (glass shatters) (crashes) - Mangler's a zombie, mangler's a zombie, read the paper mister? Latest edition, mangler's a zombie, read about it in the paper here, read all about it. Mangler's a zombie. - Patchy. Give me the paper. - 15 cents. - Thank you. - Up yours! - Look at this, mangler, a zombie. Undisclosed source reveals bloodless creature, great huh? - Oh this has got a question mark in quotes after it. - What do civilians know about quotes. I'd like to get my hands on that leak. - Probably some lab worker passing on the info to scare bunnies. Where the hell did he go, sewers? - The started checking them today. (romantic jazz music) - The perfect place. - Like I said. - Beautiful child. - Looked like her mother. - I'm sorry. It really is the perfect place. - Yeah I think so. More wine? - Please. You wouldn't believe what happened to me this morning (laughs) It was right out of one of your novels, you know? - Really? - Yeah, she just stood there dressed in black. De Remzy. Weird. She said she had a vision of a potential victim. An actor of little talent she said. - Weird. - Maybe. You know what she wanted me to do? Go on television and warn this victim. I mean can you imagine? I'd never work again, but (laughs) well, she said she talked to Mooney. He was rude. - Rude? - Rude, she said Mooney was rude, and he wasn't interested. - Did Miss De Renzy say anything else? Just that she met him at a party on a yacht. Weird, an actor, Sapphire Sea II. Well anyway, that was her theory. If the police find him, they'll follow him and they'll have their killer. Right (laughs) So um, what do you think? - Sounds right? - What do you want? (plane whooshes) (electric buzz) (creepy whispers) (ominous music) (creepy growls) (whimpers) - Oh god (screams) (crashes) (lasers zoom) (explodes) (gasps) - Randy, what's wrong? Randy what's wrong? - I don't know. So unreal. So strange. It was a bad dream I guess. - Captain? - Yeah? - My name's Mark Wallace, Inez Thortus, came in on flight 109. - Okay, take her downtown. - Got a couple of men here, I want this area kept clear. Tell the lab boys to get down here right away. What you doing Mooney, checking over the crowd again? Tell them what, we still don't know what we're looking for. If he was out there I think we could smell him by now. - What kind of a freak tears people's heads off? - Four killings, still no pattern. I mean, where the hell is the pattern? - You want a pattern, I want a killer. The chief is gonna be on our backs pretty soon. - Well you tell him Captain that it's random slaughter, that normal methods don't work here. - Normal methods always work, but it takes work. Leg work, running down every lead. - What leads, the thing doesn't leave any prints. What leads, where do we look for him, on the moon? - That's your problem. My problem is telling the mayor, yes we are having a murder every night. What the hell are we doing about it. - Captain. - Yes? - Just tell him we're working overtime huh? - Darling, I certainly had a glorious time. Of course we're going to do it again, very soon. Now look before I forget, well I've made an appointment for you next week and we'll set a time and a day, alrighty? Bye bye. Speak. - I'm Steve Dupree. - Steve Dupree, should I know you? - I need some help. - Why is it I only meet young men who need help? And not one who's capable of giving a little, sit down please? - I'm looking for a woman. - Well that's a change of pace. - An older woman, unusual. I think she was at a party here a few days ago. - I see. - I think she said her name was-- - De Renzy darling. Pandora. The Pandora, that's that weirdo's phone number. - Address? - Um, Revello Lane, Santa Monica, I don't know the number. - [Operator] What's the name please? - Yes operator, Santa Monica, but I have a little problem. - [Operator] What is your problem sir? - I have this unlisted number, and I've been trying to dial it all day and nobody answers. I just wanted to know if you could help me out and tell me if it's been changed. - We do not give out that information sir. - No I know you don't, and you shouldn't. I mean that would defeat your whole purpose right? Listen, the number is seven, two, six, three, six, seven, two. Could you just look and see if it's still in operation. The name is De Renzy. - [Operator] One moment please, I'll check. - Thank you. - [Operator] Hello, that is the correct listing sir. - That still on Revello Lane? - [Operator] 135 Revello Lane. - 135 Revello Lane, thank you. (ominous instrumental music) (knocks) De Renzy. (woman blathers unintelligibly) - You are the father of the girl. - Can I call you a doctor? - No, it will do no good, my time is short. I saw it in a mirror. It was not of this world. Do you believe that? I knew you would. With each killing the beast grows in strength. Soon he will be un-defeat-able. He must be stopped tonight. Before the young man's killed. - I don't know where to find him. - Young actors, actresses, know of his kind. - I'll call an ambulance. - Mr. Warren, I need you to put your self in terrible danger. - The Mayor, the Chief, the DA, everyone's on our backs. Especially the news media with that mangler zombie crap. - Look, what about a statement from a religious leader saying that we're not up against something supernatural. - We know that doc. - But do the people? - Doctor, the shark is known as an eating machine correct? What we have is a killing machine. - Mooney, Mooney, look the flesh samples, they're consistent. - So, what are you getting at. - According to current medical science, the data without speculation says that-- - Come on, come on. - Plain and simple, we have a creature that identifies with nothing known on earth. - That's crap. - Are you talking about a creature from outer space or what? - Well some people are Mooney. You must admit the bizarre nature of the killings and the strength of this creature are unusual. - Well screw the mumbo jumbo and the demon talk Doctor. Look I've got a brain and five senses and I say to you that the people he killed, were there just to be killed. - And I say to you that it's already dark so unless you gentlemen can come up with something else at least let us get back to work, okay? Mooney? - Yeah. - Yeah. - A nice tie my friend, it's a shame you couldn't find one that matches the ketchup on your shirt. - Yeah well if we're lucky no one finds out that we pissed off that freaky fortune teller. - Why what happened to her? - She's in the hospital, had a stroke. She has a visitor, he calls an ambulance and then he splits, guess who. - Who? - Warner. - She said it was him? - She said it was him. You now what else she said that that actor kid was gonna get it tonight. - Keeps on looking for trouble, maybe he's gonna get lucky tonight and find it. Alright, I'll tell you, you take the night off and on the way home, stop off an buy yourself bib. - It's wash and wear! - Forget it if you can't find one go to the Chinaman, go to the pizza place, keep going. - I have been all over this town. You have no idea how many young actors there are. - I can imagine. - Times running out, it's getting dark. - So what do we do next. - I don't know.
