Richard? Richard? Richard! Hey! Richard! Richard! Rich! Richard! Please, no. Please, no. Please, no. Please, no. Please. No! - Bye. - Thank you. Bye, Tami. Bye. - Bye, guys. - Bye. Bonjour. What is your profession? Uh, whatever job pays me enough to get me to the next place. How long will you be here in, uh, Tahiti? No idea. And your final destination? Okay. Hey. So why Tahiti? What brought you here? The wind, I guess. I was a cook on a schooner. But when the gig was up, I didn't really feel like going home yet. Uh-huh. Where is home for you? San Diego. California. Nice. When are you going back? Never. I don't know. Maybe once I've seen the world. Hey, mate. Why's your boat called Mayaluga? It's Swazi. I'm a Kiwi. I need a translation, please? "One who crosses the horizon." Oh. You, uh... You girls want to give me a hand? Wow, this is so beautiful. Thanks. Here. Sorry, what was your name? - Richard. - Richard, I'm Deb. Hi, Deb. This is Tami. Hey. Tami. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. See you. Nice to meet you. You too. See you around. Hey. Hey. I thought you may need this. How thoughtful. - Thanks, Tami. - No worries. Do you, uh, like fish? I'm actually a vegetarian. - So... - Right. I like them when they're alive. I was gonna see if you just wanted to grab an early dinner? Uh... But seeing as you're... Do you know what, I can make a really good vegetarian version. That sounds great. - Good, good. Sold. - Yes. Thank you. Done. Do you want me to grab anything else? Uh, some vegetables? I can do that. You've been to so many places. So cool. Yep. All on this boat? Uh, just me and her. Where did you find her? I actually built her when I was working in a boat yard in South Africa. You built this boat? Mmm. That's a big deal. That's so impressive. It's not. It is. Oh, thank you. Chin, chin. Cheers. What's it like sailing out there all alone? Uh... Miserable. Cold. Utterly awful. C'mon... Seriously? Yeah, seriously. I mean, you're either, uh, sunburnt, sleep-deprived, or seasick, usually all three at once, and constantly hungry. Hmm. Always wet. And after a few days there's the hallucinations. I'm assuming not the fun kind? Mmm-mmm. I wish. If it's not fun, then why do you do it? Uh... It... It's a feeling... A feeling I can't describe. Uh, it's intense. The infinite horizon. After a few days, uh, I feel reborn. You know, just you, the wind and the sound of the boat cutting through the ocean. I'm sorry, that was incredibly cheesy. No. Not at all, actually. So you must be a sailor too? Mmm... I love sailing. But I don't know that I would consider myself a sailor. Oh, come on. - Not like you. - Yeah, you are. I don't believe you. Do you want to take her out? Right now? Uh, sure. We could take her out right now or tomorrow. Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Yeah! Arr! You got it, baby! You got this. Yeah! Hey, the sheet's luffing, should I pull it in? I didn't think you were much of a sailor. I'm not. I mean, I learned a few things when I was a cook on that schooner. But definitely never crossed a horizon all alone like you. There we go. Whoo! Richard! Richard! Richard! Where are you? Mayday! Mayday! This is the sailing yacht Hazana! Does anyone copy? Hello? Our last recorded position was a hundred and twenty-nine degrees west and latitude twelve north. Does anyone copy? Hello? Mayday! Mayday! Is anybody there? It's my fianc√©... Our boat is sinking. Mayday! Where are you? Where are you taking me? This is unreal. Wow. Ooh, you're not gonna jump, are you? No, of course I'm not. Shut up. Fly me to the... Don't! Tami, no! Tami? I can't believe I'm doing this. Tami? Tami, are you okay? Where'd you become so wild? What? What does that even mean? I've never met anyone like you. Fearless, like a bloke. Like a bloke? I guess I've never met anyone like you either. Oh, yeah? Sensitive like a woman. The dinghy. Oh, my God! Rich, you're... Come on, you. Come on. Ugh! Dammit! No, no. No! It's drifting. It's drifting! Stop! I'm coming! I'm just going to make some repairs. All right. Here we go, girl. Let's get you moving. Looking good, mama. Aah! Hell yeah. What are you? Got the jib. Let's get this water out of here. Yeah... We can do this. We can do this. Stay. No, no, no, no, no. Stay. Stay. No, no, no, no, no, no. Work with me, girl. Looking good. All right, baby, show me what you got. Come on! Coming, baby! What is that? For me? For you. It's not my birthday, you know? I know. I... I saw it in a window and I thought of you. Uh... You don't like it? No, I love it. I... It's beautiful. Okay. Richard! Almost there. Hang on! Oh, my God, you're alive! Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Hi. Hi. Hi, I'm here. I'm here. Look at me. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Okay. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Okay, tell me, do you, uh... Do you know what flower that is? It's a plumeria, right? It's a frangipani. - A what? - A frangipani. - A frangipani. - It's a... Yeah. One second. Here you go. That's what you call it? The flower of love. It's like God put these on Earth to mask the smell of burning trash. My late mum used to say that nothing moves through life faster. In one day, one can open, it can change color, wilt, and then die. Look... Here, pass it, pass it. Sometimes the things that you say... Left or right? Uh... Uh, why? It's very, very important. You choose. Basically, if you choose your left, it means you are technically off the market, you're in a relationship. - Ooh. - Yeah, so it's... Well... Wow, wise choice. Wise choice. - Seven years? - Mmm-hmm. Wow. So that would mean that when you were beginning to work on the Mayaluga, I was celebrating my sweet 16? Yep. Jeez. And was it sweet, your 16th? No. No, my mom took me to my first bar. I had like 10 shots of Midori... Oh, my Lord. Yeah. Worst hangover of my life, hands down. So your mum's a wild one, eh? One of those young-at-heart types? Oh, she's just young, period. She was 31. Oh, when she had you? No. No, that night. She was 15 when she had me. Wow. Got knocked up when she was just a kid. Had me out of defiance. My dad's parents actually raised me. What was that like? It was what I knew. I don't know. I made attempts, of course, to run away. But Mom worked for TWA, and I think her not being around as much kind of forced me to stick around. Like I owed it to her to finish high school or something. - That makes sense. - I guess. But, man, the day I graduated, I split. My girlfriend and I had been saving up, and we bought the sickest bus, drove it across the border to Todos Santos and just lived on the beach for a few months. We started a salsa company and surfed every day. It was... It was amazing. Plan was to stay for six months, but it's been five years and here I am... Here you are. You ready to shake, old salt? Sorry... - Can I say no? No. No, no. - Yes. Yes. Oh, you have been warned. I'm sorry this... This is the best I've got. No, you've got more in there, I know it. Oh, no. No, you're a much better dancer. It's the dress. It is the dress. That's why you bought it for me. Ah, got me. Hey, Tami... Yeah? Will you sail around the world with me? Exhale for me. Hey, it's okay. It's done. Just breathe. What? What, what, what, what? My ribs. My ribs. My ribs. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Put your arm around me. Ready? One, two, three, lift. Okay, okay... Shh. What about Fatu Hiva? We could sail there first. It could work. It could work, yeah. As long as we don't go through Hana Vave. Everyone goes through it, it's become a bit of a dump. Oh, what's the draw then? Better anchorage. Lazy suckers. Omoa Bay. Now that... That is, I mean, that is parfait. Yeah? What, the beaches? Yeah. Just like beyond amazing. What about Japan? I've always wanted to check it out. - Are you kidding me? - Mmm-mmm. It's like my number one place, like... - Really? - Yeah. We gotta go. How long do you think it would take to sail there? - Forever. But does it matter? - No. No. God, I just want to go everywhere with you. Then everywhere we will go. Richard! Richard! Richard! What? Tally-ho! Where the hell have you been hiding? How are you, mate? Oh, just everywhere. Good to see you, Richard. I nearly rang the bloody coast guard. Sorry. Sorry, this is... This is Tami. Tami. - Hi. - Christine. - Christine. Peter. - Nice to meet you. - Hi, my pleasure. - Same. Tami. Yeah, well... How have you guys been? - Oh, really good. - Great. We were just off for a coffee, do you want to join us? I'm glad we bumped into you, Richard, because... Well, there's something we'd like to talk to you about, actually. The thing is, Richard, we've got to go back to London rather suddenly, and we wanted to ask if you'd be interested in... Yeah, we've been trying to find someone, and I don't know if you'd be keen, but... How'd you like to sail the Hazana back to California for us? We can pay $10,000 plus a first-class ticket return. Seriously? You're... You're joking, right? - No, mate. - No. What do you say? Uh... Where... Where in California? San Diego. Wow. Uh... I don't mean to look a gift horse in the mouth here, but is there any possibility of making it two tickets back? Done and done. Done and done. Brilliant! Wow. That is... When do you leave? Well, we're hoping to get out no later than next week. And the things is, we don't want to press you, but it would be great if you could let us know when you could set sail. Mmm-hmm. Yeah, we can do that. - Great. - We can, um, mull it over. Are you sure you want to put me in charge of these numbers? I'm shit at math. You can do anything you put your mind to. Mom used to tell me the same thing. And then she would say that my mind was too strong. Probably should have just been more like her, huh? Have kids by now. Live in the suburbs somewhere. Well, I'd still be in the Naval Academy if I'd listened to me dad. But I decided to live my own life. We're... We're so far north! Well, we are drifting. How far? Way further than I thought. What's the latitude? Eighteen degrees north. That's like a fifteen hundred square mile search area... We're gonna die out here. We're not on any flight paths, there's no shipping lanes... Tami... No one knows we're here. We'll be fine. Hey. Hey. You okay? I don't want to feel like I'm following you on your adventures. I get that it's a really cool opportunity, but I'm not really looking to go home yet. It's not the direction I wanna go in, and if that's what you want, then... I'm sorry. I'm not going. I'm not asking you to do that. I know. I sailed half the world to find you. I'm not just letting that go. What? Ugh. Well, can I see this big bad boat? The boat's fifty-five feet... Fourteen seconds... Means we're going about two... two-and-a-half knots. We could hit San Diego in twenty-five days. But then with these headwinds, it could take months... Well, what if we don't sail to San Diego? What do you mean? I mean, what if we hang left and we go to Hawaii? Like navigators did back in the day. Yeah, but most of those sailors didn't make it, Tam. If you miss Hawaii... I know, there's nothing till Japan. It's like a two thousand mile shot at a moving target. If we miss Hawaii, we die. We'd be adding five hundred miles. Yeah, but the current and the wind would be behind us. Okay. Take a left on the nineteenth... Yeah. The moment we hit the dock, I cried out, "God, I'm glad to be back in Rangiroa!" There's a fellow nearby, he looks to his wife and he says to us, "You're not in Rangiroa... - "You're in Apataki." - No. How? That's like 100 miles away! Yeah, no shit. The longest sail of my life, Richard. Sorry about that, darling. Well, cheers, everyone. Cheers. What's the, uh... What's the rush back to London, - if you don't mind me asking? - Ah. Well, it's Christine's father, he's not well. - Oh. - I'm sorry. Will he be okay? He's ninety-four. It's a good innings. You'd be a life-saver, Richard. Wow. This is beautiful. Oh, Richard. We're out of ginger beer... We're just gonna go and grab some from the clubhouse. Okay? Make yourselves at home. We'll be back in a while. Thanks. So, what do you think of the big bad boat then? I think four thousand miles is insane... Yeah, but in a month we'd make enough to fund an entire year traveling together. - Oh, a year? - Ah. Who said anything about a year? Why are you trying to get rid of me? Why are you trying to have sex with me? Why not? Here? I mean, it's our boat now, so why not? So you're in? Just for those first-class plane tickets. Whoa. - Later, you dirty old man. - Come on. Dear Mum, sorry it's been a while. I wanted to let you know that I am going to be coming home. I got this job sailing this gorgeous yacht from down here back to San Diego. It's about a thirty-day crossing, so hopefully we'll get there right before Halloween. Come on, come on, come on. It looks like we have a quarter tank of water! I really hope you're in town because I'm going to be bringing my new boyfriend. His name is Richard. He's a little bit older. Uh, he's from England. We've only been together a few months now, but, I don't know, I really feel like he's the one. Bon voyage, lovers. I guess we'll find out after crossing the Pacific together. Anyway, I can't wait to see you and Gram and Grandpa. Dad, if he's around. I'll see you soon. I love you so much. That's it. We've eaten all the fresh stuff. Ouch. Is this it? Yeah. It's everything I could salvage. Here. You need to drink this. Come on. Okay, close your eyes. Are you ready to love me even more? Look. Open your eyes. Is that peanut butter? Ha. Do you want a hand? No. I got it. Oh. How much do you love me right now? Huh? - Is it good? - Mmm. It's so good. Oh, my God. Wow. So what do you think of that? - Huh? - It's so red. - Come on. - What? What, is that how you'd describe a painting by Monet? Red? - If it was red, I would. - Red. Yeah. No. No. That sunset's not red. That sunset is beet-dyed pomegranate. Ladies and gentlemen, Bob Ross. Can you see... I say it's kind of got a beety... It's definitely red. No, no, no. With a hit of mandarin and flax and the faintest hint of carnelian. Red. Red sky at night. Sailor's delight. Who the hell is Bob Ross, anyway? You don't know who Bob Ross is? Should I? He's like the master of kitsch. Uh, he's like a modern-day Monet. You would love him. Wait a second... Aw. Wait, let me see you. Wait... Your cheeks, they're going to... Let me guess, they're red? No, no. It's definitely not red. More like, um, a sizzling salmon ketchup. Tam? What is it? Hold on. We're off sixty miles. And we lost a degree of latitude. We... How? I don't know! Maybe the clock's not working? Or I messed up the math or something? We're over eighteen hundred miles from Hawaii. Fricking rudder's not helping. It's making it impossible to stay on course. Oi, no, no, no. We need to ration now. Okay, you wanna starve to death? You wanna be a victim, be my guest. You make it sound like it's a choice. - It is a choice, Tam. - It's not a choice! Shut up! You okay? It has a jib caught on it. I can't get it off. Maybe it'll have to just trail. And create all that drag? - Babe? - How is it? It's okay. Is everything okay down there? Yeah. We're running low on water. Seven cans of sardines. Nine cans... of God knows what. Let's pray for peaches. Fortunately, I think it's gonna be beans. Three cans of Spam. Ugh. Thank God, the bloody hot sauce didn't break though. This isn't gonna last us a week. Well... We can supplement with protein. I'm not doing that. - I'm not gonna kill any fish. - Why not? 'Cause I'm not gonna make something suffer. That food's not gonna last us till Hawaii. I know it's not. Sorry. My ribs are broken, my leg is shattered. I'm dead weight. Just relax. Easy for you to say. All right, well, remember it could be worse. Could die of hunger. I can't do it. It's too hard. It's okay. I can't do it. What you got hiding in here? What? No way. We've struck gold. Are you kidding me right now? We're gonna have a party! A little touch of humanity... Well, I turn around to look at you Light a cigarette I wish I had the guts to bum one You don't know me yet And I hope that I don't fall in love with you 'Cause falling in love just makes me blue Well, the music plays And you display your heart for me to see I wish you'd never met me... So you wouldn't be in this mess. But I wouldn't have us to remember. I wouldn't trade this for anything. 'Cause falling in love Just makes me blue I had a beer and now I hear You calling out for me Well, I think that I just Fell in love with you Come on. Hey, babe, can I ask you something? Sure. How did your mum die? Uh, you really want to know? You don't have to tell me. Just... Curious. When I was seven, she hung herself. What? Yeah, it... It's fine. It's... It's years ago now. So... Wow, I'm so sorry. But, Christ, the first person in your life who dies is supposed to be old, you know? Not your bloody mother. Uh, I think what I've done over the years is just sort of... Sort of internalized. What? Internalized what? Her voice, I guess. Yeah. Like, in my mind, I still... I still ask her to take a look at things. And still listen to her tell me if something is right or wrong, or... What is she saying now? Uh... "So it's true what they say, innit? "All men really do wanna marry their mums." Oh, fuck, did I just ask you to marry me in the voice of my dead mother? Oh, God. Okay, let me... Let me try that one more time. I love you. Mmm-hmm... And I know that I wanna be with you forever. So, uh... Oh, my God. Will you please marry me? You're not supposed to say "please." You make it sound like it's a favor. Right. Uh... Okay. But yes, yes. - Should I... - Of course. Sorry. I must have made it too small. - Is that... Is that all right? - Did you make this? Yes, well... But I promise when we get back to the States, we can get you a real one. No. It's perfect. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Hey! Hello! Hey! I'm right here! Stop! Hello! No. No... No! No! No, no, no... How could you not see us? We're right here! We're right here! Where did you go? Where did you go? I'm hallucinating? Am I hallucinating? Oh, my God, we're gonna die out here! We're gonna die out here! We might. You're not supposed to say that! You'd rather I lied to you? Yes, please lie to me. Just tell me it's gonna be okay. Tell me that this is real. What does that even mean? We're probably dead already. Exhausted... Dehydrated... Delirious, uh... Yeah. But you're not dead. Okay. Wake up. Baby, you've got to drink some water. Open. - More. One more. - Uh-uh. Come on. You have to eat something too. It's more important you have it. There's plenty for me. Open. Dammit, take a bite. You have to eat something. You let me sleep through the night again? Yeah. And another night. And another day. Just wake me up when we get to Hawaii. Guess what? We only have 690 miles to go. Only? Yeah, only, baby. No, no. Stay awake. Look at me. Look... Look, look, look... I'm the... I'm the one who crosses the horizon. I'm a real sailor! Whoa! What was that? Babe, you've got to come see this! Is that a land bird? Yeah. What's it doing this far from shore? I don't know. The wind must have blown her in. All the way from land? I think so. It's remarkable, right? Should we be worried? Hey, take the wheel, I've just got to check this. A warning to those in the Pacific. High winds and expected rainfall are now changed to a tropical depression forming off Central America, and is now classified as a Class 4. It's moving quickly and increasing in strength, currently at 12 degrees north and 107 degrees and moving west at 12 knots. Babe, that's not good... And a repeat, for those of you just tuning in. - Babe? - Just one sec, please. Right, so we're at 11 north and 123 west. That's well over 1,000 miles away from the center of the storm. It should die out before it reaches us, but... We have to watch this one. What if we just alter our course? Huh? We cut north, give the storm a wider berth. What do you think of that? You're right, let's do it. We need to make sure everything is secure. Yeah, we need to tack first. All right, let's tack. - All right, lock it up. - Yep. We don't want any stuff flying around in case the storm hits. Hey, I'll get that. Look at that. Wake up. What do you make of that? It's pink absinthe. Hmm. And bloody marigolds in Hawaiian reduction. It's red. - Did you just say "red"? - Mmm. You coming round to my side? Tami, it's red. It is. Finally. It's red. It's red... Red sky in the morning... Sailors take warning... Another fricking storm? Hey, babe. Oh, my God. Oh, Christ, you're burning up. It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna build a shelter for the storm. Okay? Okay. Let the sheet go! What? Let the sheet off now! Okay. Help! Take the halyard off! It's released! Help me! It was just a squall. It's amazing, isn't it? How just a little sheet can make the whole world feel like it disappears? Do you see? When I was little, my dad used to come visit at my grandparents' house. We never knew when he was coming, he would just show up. When he arrived, I would get so excited because he was my favorite person in the whole world. He would take me surfing and get me ice cream and... The next morning, he would always be gone. We never knew where he was going, he would just disappear. And then starting when I was about ten, my grandparents stopped letting him in when he would show up. And he would just fly into a rage. Screaming and shouting and... I heard a lot of things that most young girls never have to hear. But when it was happening, I would go into the bathroom, I would lock the door and get in the bathtub, and I'd put a blanket over the shower rod, and I'd pretend like I was anywhere else in the whole world. We could do that right now. We could pretend we were somewhere else. Hurricane Raymond is now classified as a Category 4... Mayday! Mayday! This is the sailing yacht Hazana. Do you copy? We need to head southwest! Are you sure? If we can't get above it, maybe we can sneak below it! What did you say? Nothing. Just... Just get the EPIRBs. I love you. Do you want me to go? I got it! Be careful! Hold on! Hold on! - I've got you! - Richard! Richard! It's all right! It's all right. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. I thought I'd lost you there for a minute. You're not gonna lose me. Now, get below. It's safer. I'm not going down without you! We could roll! The boat will right itself. Get below! I'm not leaving you! Get below now! Oh, my God! Tam, get in now! You need to get in. Go! Here... Here... Put your safety harness on! Tam... Tami... Get up. Now. Richard... I'm gonna let you go now. I'll love you forever. And after a few days, there's the hallucinations. Are you ready to love me even more? If I hadn't met you, then I wouldn't have us to remember. I wouldn't trade this for anything. I have to do this on my own now. Hi. You're back. What are you doing here? Where did you come from? Are you okay? Okay, we got you. Yeah. Can you tie up the stern line? Mmm. * Rambo Media Ltd *
