Of course, there's real concern that deregulation may recreate the very same conditions that caused the crash leading to average investors, retirees and blue collar people in middle America losing their savings.

He must have trusted you. Hey! Shit. Oh! Aw! Nice ride. What are you hiding back there, huh? Where's Moze? Oh, he's down by the beach. Making the most of the time away from his responsibilities. Getting drunk. Second wife, new kid. He's changed. All grown up. But not us, right? How's work treating you? - It's good. - Oh, good. Well, come on inside. I'll set you up. When were you here last? Must have been ten years? This is the basement now. That's a bedroom. You don't want to know how much money I dumped into this place. Let's go upstairs. And, uh, I'll give you the tour. Huh! Liz still dabbles. Worries people don't get her work. Kitchen's all been redone. Damn faucet. I have to fix it. All the water's from that old well out front. Smells like sulfur. Liz likes it, thinks it's rustic. I think it smells like shit. But... you can still drink it. The big room is over there. You and Moze can fight for it like old times. You know, yeah. The loft's all new. Liz's idea. She's always had taste. Want a beer? This almost makes everything worth it. What does? The view. It's worth it. Hmm. There he is. Get up here, you gypsy bastard! - Jack's here. - Jack! Oh, man. Am I glad to see you. Ah, goddammit! Asshole, I'm not here for your pleasure. What's up, buddy? - How are you doing, Jackie? - It's good to see you, Moze. Yeah, of course it is. Where were you before Maine again? Virginia. You got to settle down, man. Right? You can't build anything that way. Ha! Who-hoo-hoo-hoo! Where the hell did you find this thing? Business trip. New Orleans. That explains everything. - Quit, quit! - You quit. Do you remember that time that Moze walked out on the deck and... ...and the whole thing started shaking? Yeah, I remember it vividly. Everybody ran inside while I rode that deck to the ground. You don't remember? Oh, I wasn't there. Ah, that's right. You were with Liz. How is she? She wants a kid. Thinks that's the answer to the great question. Questions? We don't need no stinking questions. - No. - No, no, no, no, no. Oh! I want to take you guys out to the dunes tomorrow. There's space out there. Men need that. You know, you didn't say anything about climbing. Come on, you scamp. Hey, guys, there's a rope. Just... Not bad, huh? Thousands of years ago, all this was covered in glaciers. When they melted, they left these piles of sand behind. Come on. What the hell is this? Kind of reminds me of my first wife. They are petrified. Yeah, she got pretty fucking scary. This is amazing. I thought you'd like it. I always like to end up here. Makes sense. Sand everywhere and then water you can't drink. Luckily for me, I brought my own. How about that? I've been coming here for 20 years, and only found one once. Let me see it. Every once in a while, lightning will hit these dunes, and the sand will turn into glass. It's very rare. Only a few pieces each year. You should keep it. For luck. I was hit by lightning once. - Bullshit! - No, it's true. My knob was electric for a week. Diane loved it. What? That was funny. Liz... loved this place ever since she was a kid. She thinks I don't care enough. Maybe she just needs to see you like this. - I got pitcher. - No! - I can pitch. - No, you can't pitch. Come on, test me. Really throw one. Get him, Jack. Come on! Throw the damn ball! Show me what you're made of. Hit him, Jack. Show his ass. Damn! Nearly spilled my beer. That's more like it. Some fire. Yeah. Pitch them like that, just, uh, across the plate. I sold short. Made a killing. Everyone's selling short. No long-term investment. Hoping for failure. I only know how to win. Seems easier in a rigged game. Alright, what the fuck are you guys talking about? I'm hungry. I bet you a hundred bucks I catch something before either one of you. Jack doesn't catch fish. What exactly do you do, Jackie? I like to cast. Yeah, but why not fish? Jackie, that's the whole point, is you catch the fish then you eat the fish that you catch. You know, he hates that. Hates what? Jackie. He hates it when you call him that. Sorry... Jackie. You know... ...let's make it a thousand dollars. - A thousand? - Yeah. If there's one thing I've learned over the past few years, sometimes you got to go all in. I have something, you're on, deal! Damn it, aw, damn it! I mean, what can I say? I've always been a lucky guy. Yeah, you got that right. Semi-good looking from birth, born into an old money, New England family. Of course, pockets were kind of bare by the time they got you, huh. Alright, you can keep the thousand, if that's what's eating you. Money's never been my problem. Know, you were knee deep in pussy from the moment we got to Dartmouth. And then you meet Liz, junior year, and you swept her off her feet. Then, you know, you had connections and money. That's my story, Moze. What's yours? Look at you. You're drunk and embarrassing yourself, - as usual. - Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on. Who're you protecting? Him? He doesn't have your back. Moze... What? Ask any of his partners. No, better yet, ask Liz. Hey. You used to shine, man. What's it like not being so shiny anymore? - What the fuck... - Hey, hey! - What the hell, man! - Hey, hey! He's not himself. I was joking. Huh! Jack, you know I was joking, right? Huh? Come on, I hate... you know how I get. I... drink... I say too much, I go too far. I'm sorry, man. Come on. Give me a hug. It's burning. Shit! Goddammit. - Fuck it! - Yeah, fuck it. Come on, to the beach! Let's go! Well, that was a hell of a night. Where's Moze? Moze! Moze! You know he really has a problem, right? Irresponsible jackass. It's Moze. - Hey. - Mm. - Hey. - Hey, son of a bitch, what? Where am I? Believe it or not, we were worried about you. That's because you still love me. - What day is it? - Sunday. I need to get home. Hey, um, I want to apologize for being a drunken ass. I, I don't even drink that much anymore. I just hope I didn't say or do anything that would be unforgivable. Because you're... you two are my oldest friends. And I'd, I'd, I'd hate for you guys to be mad at me. It's okay, Moze. Just take care of yourself, okay? Jack. Andy. I'm sorry. Truly. Give Diane my best. Liz too. Gentlemen! Until next time! I used to love this coffee. Free-trade, organic. Used to be the best shit. Now it's just old shit. You know what I mean? The coffee? What else would I be talking about? Your friends. No. I'm not as smart as you. I don't talk between the lines. You know, being indirect isn't a sign of intelligence. You know it's true. I'm more successful. But I've never been as smart. Then I should have all this... and you should have my truck. No. It's not where you come from either. I think you're too smart. It trips you up. You overthink things. If there's grand connections to be made, I don't see them. So, I find that nothing really matters too much. It frees me. I know what I want, and I take it. What's Moze's deal? You know what Moze's deal is. You see through us. You think too highly of me. Come on. Moze never had any dreams. The ones he has now... aren't really his, they are other people's, like what he's picked up generally from Dartmouth or... wherever he's been. You never fail to impress. You just need someone to push you. Maybe that's your real problem. Hm. - Andy, it's Liz! - Pick it up. Tell her I'm not around, will you? Liz, it... it's Jack. Jack? Yeah. Andy, he's, uh, he's indisposed. It's good to hear your voice. Yeah. It's, it's, really... - I don't want to keep you, Liz. - You're not keeping me. Andy will call you back. It was really good talking to you, goodbye. Andy, I'm going for a walk! Go ahead. I'm going to shower and take care of some work. Let's get into some trouble tonight. I feel stir crazy. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, well, what are you going to do? You're not going to do a fucking thing. I got out at the right time and you didn't, and that's all on you. We don't hold each other's pricks. Yeah, well, fuck you too! Stupid motherfucker. Oh, hi. Did you hear that bullshit? Some. Yeah, just some investor. Blames me for having the good judgment to dump a company at the right time. Did you give him a heads-up? Not exactly. You can't tell that guy anything anyway. Come on. Let's get a drink. Nice jacket. Oh, yeah? It's kind of your style. The working man's jacket. I always wanted to be a working man. Cool clothes. Nice place, huh. Yeah. It's not much of an inn, but it has its qualities. Good beer and I like to spend time with the locals. Yeah. Reminds me of Buffalo. Hope that doesn't pain you too much. I like the familiarity. That is the spirit. Hi. Um, my friend wants to know, are you guys in the movies or something? Sometimes we get Hollywood people that stay up on the lake. As a matter of fact, we are in the movie business. Aren't we, Jack? You're teasing. I find work so tedious. My name's Becca. This is Kate. You look younger, clean shaven. Oh, that's right. You came in the store the other day. God, you look different. - Very handsome. - Thanks. You've always kept secrets, Jack. Well, at least we can pretend we're movie stars. To movie stars. This place is beautiful. Hm. I built this place with my own hands. Oh! A real man. - Mm-hm. - There aren't too many of those left these days. Jack's a carpenter. What? I don't believe you. An Ivy League educated carpenter. Is that true? Yeah. I'm going to school. Community college. I grew up here. Always thought I'd get away, but... now I don't want to. It's a good place. So, what do you think of her? Who? Kate. She likes you. She's young. Mm. She doesn't have any regrets yet. Hm. She's pretty. Yes, very. But we're here. Are you coming? Just a minute. Where's Becca? Hm? Can I hold your hand? We've got to go, honey. Unless you want to stay, I've got work. Thank you. They are gone? You didn't want to say goodbye? You know how I get sometimes. I drank too much. And it seemed like a good idea. - Liz and I... - I don't judge. Yes, you do. We all do. Can we just let this go? You're here, this is your last day. Come on, let's have some fun. A little more reminiscing, a little more forgetting about the future, huh? - Come on, man. - Stop, stop. Fine. I've seen you like this before. Back in college. In this exact position. Staring at your hands and thinking about something, probably important. What question can our hands answer? I'm not sure. I envy your hands. Being envious is an ugly quality, don't you think? Never satisfied. Never happy. It makes me stupid. I make dumb choices. And I don't appreciate what I have right in front of me. Let me see. Well-worked. It looks like you actually built something with them. I built an investment portfolio with mine, but it doesn't feel the same. My hands never made any damn sense to me. No matter how much I work with them, they never grow as calloused as my father's. Why work for other people? You should have your own construction company. Yeah. My sort of people don't do that. You never had a sort of people, Jack. You've never wanted to lose your family, but they are already gone. You surpassed them when you were born. That's what they wanted for you. Stop. This how it is now? You'll never catch me! - Ha! - Jesus Christ! You should see your face. What kind of move was that? Sneak Attack. Yeah, sure thing, buddy. Yeah, yeah, sure thing. I can use that. You know, the trail... it's up there. Now remember, I always win. Congratulations on being an asshole. What's wrong? It's good times, man. Don't touch me. You're not eating. How is it? Good. Ah! We're getting soft. Speak for yourself. I can do 100 pushups right now. Can you? - Don't want to. - Come on. Get over here and do pushups with me. You don't think you can. No. You're being absurd. Oh, God, it's hot. You'll be cold in a minute. What? You can see into the future now too? What? Just say it. You're always holding back. Holding your tongue. I was only concerned. No, you were disapproving. And that's different. Never mind. I don't want to argue... on your last night here. This is your last night, isn't it? - It can be. - That's right. You have a flexible schedule. Why is that, Jack? Yeah, go into that bottle. That'll save you. Do you really want to be honest, Andy? Why not? I've got nothing going on. How's your job going? Big deals, huh? Real big deals. You're... you're a real great businessman. You're a real great guy. I got fired from my last job. How come? Hit my boss. That'll do it. He said something about this woman at work. What did he say? It's not important. Everything is a riddle with you, man. Jesus, you're exhausting. You know, Liz agrees with me, I think. You're tiring. I'm tired of you. Maybe you should go back. To wherever it is the fuck you call home. Sounds like a good idea. You know what? To think of what your life could've been like if Liz had chosen you. I can almost picture it. I doubt you could've kept her, though. You think she didn't choose you because you're not good enough. She didn't choose you because you don't know who the fuck you are. What? You want to hit me, huh? You want to hit me, Jackie? You're a child, Andy. You've always been a child looking for new toys. No, you want to have what I have. You want to be me. I pity you. I feel bad for Liz. She's too good for you. No. Keep putting her on that pedestal, pal. She's no saint. She's like me. We're both whores. Fuck you, Andy. Don't you fucking walk away from me. You fucking coward! Fuck you, Jack. You're supposed to... Stop it! Stop it. Stop! Andy? Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. It's going to be okay. I don't understand, I don't understand. Hello. Andy. Hello. Cleaning off the beach, huh? That's right. That's very nice of you. God's work really. You're a friend of Andy's? - Yes. - Oh! Is he around? - Huh? - Is Andy up at the cottage? No. He, uh... he left. Oh! Well, I'm Bob. I'm president of the cottage association here. Welcome. You don't kitesurf, do you? A few of us get together from time to time. - What? - Kitesurf. You know, you, you surf with a kite. No. I don't, I don't do that. Uh, too bad. Yeah, this dune grass ate up a kite of mine the other day. But I have a few, if you ever want to borrow one. Okay. Thanks again for the work you're doing here. - The association appreciates it. - Sure. Good day to you. Nice to meet you. Come on. Shit. Who's there? Hi, Jack. It's been a long time. I had to come up here and see for myself. He was never here, was he? He's with her. Who? With a woman he's been seeing. I don't know her name. No, he was, um, he was here. He, he left last night. You don't have to lie for him. I'm not. No, Liz, I'm not. Then he left to be with her? I don't, I don't know anything about that. He just said he had to go to... Grand Rapids... some business. He didn't have to go anywhere for business. Promise me you're telling the truth. I don't know anything about it, Liz. I swear. I, uh... You know, I should, I should get going. I haven't seen you in so long, and you're already planning your escape? Am I really that awful to be around? You don't have to answer that. I'm a mess. I wouldn't want anybody to just see me like this, especially you. I'm going on about myself. I guess that was always the problem. What about you? What are you up to? Do you have someone? No. I haven't seen you in, what? Five years. Say something, Jack. Oh, uh... I don't know what to say. Just want to know how you are. Where do you live? How's construction? Too many questions? Pick one. Uh... I haven't been too successful. Who has? Look at me. I'm a... painter who rarely paints, and when I do, no one cares. You're a wonderful painter. You haven't seen my recent work. I've seen enough. You don't, you don't lose a talent like that. And then there's my husband... I'm going to fix this before I go. Are you thirsty? I'm thirsty. Andy hates the well water, but I prefer it. Kind of sums it all up, I guess. Doesn't it? No! What? You can't drink the water. I'm sorry, I forgot. I forgot in catching up. Um, the water has bacteria in it. Yeah. You can't drink it until it's treated. Andy had a guy, um, come over, just before Moze and I arrived. How can that even happen? I don't know. Andy, um, Andy said that the well cover was off when he arrived. He didn't know why, you know? Blamed the maintenance guy. Um, and he said that something, you know, like a snake or a rat got in there and, uh... died. Disgusting. How do you get rid of it? Bleach. You pour a lot of bleach. Did Andy take care of the bleach before he left? I don't, uh, I don't think so. Well, then I'll have to take care of that. No, no, no, no. Uh... I'll do it. I think there's some in the shed. Okay. I got it. I don't know how you guys survived two days together. Sorry? There's no food in the fridge. We must have eaten it all. Uh-huh. More like, drank everything and forgot to eat. Men! That's right. I'm going to get us some groceries. Oh, no, you don't, you don't have to. I want to. Let me make you a meal in appreciation for everything you've done. Becca! Find what you're looking for? Yes, thank you. Thank you. Don't I know you? You look familiar. Maybe we've seen each other around. I've come up here summers my whole life. You live over by Ottawa Trail, don't you? I have friends who live over there. That's right. Hm. Oh, your husband's Andy, right? You know Andy? We met him, uh, over at the inn. That's how I recognize you. Both of you met him? Oh, we just had a few drinks together. He talked a lot about you. Got out pictures of you and everything. That sounds like Andy. That'll be, uh, $47.98. Thank you for coming to the Stony Lake Store. Have a great day. Thank you. That was cruel. Let me help you with that. How did it go? Took care of it. I, uh, I had to get down in there. I'll go start dinner. That sounds nice. You look refreshed. Almost like back in college. Sure. We were supposed to end up at that party that night, but we never made it. We just sat in the park and you held me. I remember you were still shaking. We missed the deck fall down. That's right. I guess the whole world was shaking that night. You were my protector, but you never made a move. Yeah. It didn't feel right. Everything could have changed. Maybe it did. I'm okay. You're cold, take it. Andy won't mind. He doesn't really care about any of his things here. That's not true. You've seen how he is. He had some girls over here the other night. I met them at the store. They are young. It's overrated. What is? Being young. So, is getting older. That always looked ridiculous on Andy. Looks better on you. Thanks. It's not that bad. It's too late, and we've had too much to drink. You have to spend the night. I'll fix that thing before I leave tomorrow. Yes, that's a great idea. I think we should fix our whole lives before you leave. I don't think they taught us that in school. School sold dreams. Yeah. I didn't fit in then. School's out. I don't fit in now. That's the thing you never realized. You thought you were the only one. None of us fit in. Not one of us, ever. And I don't just mean the people from school. I mean, no one. Not a single person in the entire world. Listen to me. I've had too much to drink. I should get to bed. Don't sleep in the basement. Take this room. Bed's more comfortable. I like knowing you're nearby. Oh, my God. I thought I heard someone. We're safe here, Jack. I... I don't know what I was thinking. It's okay. Let's go back to bed. Okay. Morning. Ah! Dammit. Funny, huh? Yep. And last night. Okay. You ready? Fixed. Almost. I should, uh, I should really get going. Just one more day? I'm not ready to get back to the real world yet. Okay. I'll fix the sink though. Damn it! Okay. You sure? Hm-mm. You are a mess. Yeah, I know. I've already thrown your laundry in. I hope you don't mind. Had to be done. Get out of those clothes, I'll throw them in too. What'll I wear? Just go upstairs and borrow some of Andy's things. Okay. Well? Definitely not your style. Really? I thought I was pulling it off. I didn't say you weren't pulling it off. See that place? Looks like a castle. I used to make up stories about the people living there. Drew pictures of them going about their lives. My mother thought I'd gone crazy. It's funny, we see people and we think we know everything about them. I never even saw the inside of that house. It's more fun that way. Mm. You ever wish you had a family? I haven't really thought about it. I don't believe that. I think you'd make a great father. Why? You're loyal. - Hey, Andy, Liz. - Come on in, Bob. Cleaning up the beach, huh? Oh, uh, I'm, I'm sorry. I thought you were Andy. You look just like him. Jack, right? It's good to see you again. I, uh, I saw your car out front, Liz, and thought I'd stop in to say hello. And, uh, thought I'd see if Andy wanted to come out kitesurfing with the crew. Is he back? No. Oh, that's strange. I, I thought I saw him driving away after you and I talked, Jack. Yeah, who knows. Everyone has SUVs these days. It's great marketing. They, uh, they all look the same though. I haven't been sleeping much on account of my back, so I've been taking long walks on the beach in the morning. This kitesurfing is killing me... ...but I just can't give it up. You know how that goes. And I thought Andy might've come back with you, Liz. That's too bad. Now, you're sure you don't want to take up kitesurfing? I've got the spare kite. That's nice of you. I'll be going pretty soon. Well, when you come back sometime. A friend of Andy and Liz is a friend of mine. Well, I'd better get going. Fare thee well. I'll see you around. And, uh... give my best to Andy too. You said Andy left the night before. You were covering for him. He was here until right before I arrived. I'm sorry, Liz. I, I should have been honest. No, I'm sorry. It seems I can't trust any of my friends. - Wait... - Yeah. From the store, I know. I work a couple jobs to pay for college. Good for you. Are you closing soon? Uh, we're slow today. What can I get you? Something different. This is sweet. Too much? No. Can you sit with me? I don't like to sit alone. - Oh. - I'm asking too much. I can, for a minute. You have a nice way about you. Are you going to be okay? It never gets easier, you know. But I'll be all right. We figure it out. Jack? We need to talk, Andy. Call me. Huh! I was worried about you. I went for a walk. Did you figure everything out? What do you mean? Long walks are for sorting things out. I rarely take them anymore. Then you have to do something. I don't want to lose him, Jack, because... then I'd really have to face myself. I've made a mess of everything. You haven't. It's rare. Like... a chance to change your life. We only get a few of those. I have to leave in the morning for work. Of course you do. We have to get back. Jack? What do you want? You have to tell me. You. Come here. I want to make sure this is really okay for the both of us. My marriage is over. I don't feel like I owe Andy anything. Do you? No. This is just a night. It means, care. That's all. I understand. Are you okay? I can't breathe. Jack! Why did you bother coming back? I had to see you. That's not true. I came back to make things right. You left because you don't trust anyone. You came back because you don't know what you want or who you are. Now you know. That's right. Andy's honest in a way. He has an appetite for possessions. He never denies it. But you... you've been pretending all these years to be different. All Andy's clothes. All Andy's things. Even Andy's wife. I finally see you now. You're empty inside, and all these years you thought being Andy would complete you. Stop, stop it! Just, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I've never thought of you that way. I feel like a fool. To think that there could have been something real between us. What about you, Liz? - Tell me. - You don't want to know the truth. - Nobody does. - Say it! You liked the attention. Made you feel good, it's turned you on. It allowed you not to look inward. That's what's important. That's something that I know about myself. That's something that I know... about people. No, most people aren't like you, Jack. I am not afraid to look at myself. Not anymore. You should leave. Where's Andy? Where is he? You've all the answers, Liz. I don't know. Please... I just want to know the truth. Where is he? I need you to let this go, Liz. No, I... I can't. Andy was many things but... he wouldn't have left without this. That's right. Can you tell me? Can you tell me where he is? - Please. - I just really need, need for you to tell me where he is. Is he hurt? Did something happen to him? Was it an accident? I just need to know. I need to know what happened to him. I need you to tell me. Jack, please. Please, just talk to me. - Calm down. - Talk to me, I need you to tell me. - Calm down. - What happened to him? We can make this work. - Where is he? - Stop. Can you please just, just talk to me? Just look at me. - I just need... - Please, Liz, stop it! - It's okay, I just... - We can make this work. No! I just need you to, no, Jack, please. - Liz, stop! - Jack, please. - Just talk to me, just talk to me... - Liz! Stop it. Please.
