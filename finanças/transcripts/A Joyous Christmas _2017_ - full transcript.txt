RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM We are live at the Fall Oaks Annual Christmas Festival where Fall Oaks native Rachel Kennedy has returned to not only kick off the festivities but will also be presenting her live event, Rachel Kennedy's Inspiration Celebration which coincides with the upcoming release of her newest motivational book, "Me First" her follow up to last year's book, "You Deserve It All". With the best-selling author in town this is sure to be an exciting and inspiring holiday for all. They're sure excited to have you back home. Wish the feeling was mutual. Thank you, Bridget. You sure being back home isn't getting to you? The publishers really wanna push the successful home-grown heroine returns to her roots story. I really need you to sell this. I know. And I will. Alright, it's almost that time. We'll see you on stage doing what you do best. I know. Inspire. Now that we've officially opened the Fall Oaks Christmas countdown, it's sure to be our best Christmas season so far! And now, please join in welcoming our hometown hero, Rachel Kennedy! Thank you, Mayor Hartley, for this special honour. And I am so looking forward to seeing each and every one of you at my live "The Inspiration Celebration" event. I would like to take a moment to speak from the heart. I have some homework for you. When you go home tonight I would like you to take a look in the mirror. Really look at the person looking back at you. That is the most important person in your universe and you need to take care of that person first. Thank you. And now, the people of Fall Oaks and I would like to present to you the key to the city! Well, that was a good day. I think it was a really good day. This is you right here. Great. So... Bridget apparently has a romantic Skype date with Josh so wanna grab a bite to eat? No can do. I gotta go over the expenditures and check in with the family back home. I hope the hotel has good wi-fi. Ok. Hey. Tonight is your chance to unwind. We got you in this great townhouse. Put your feet up, watch an old Christmas movie. Order some take-out. They do have take-out in this town, right? No, you're right. We have a long two weeks ahead of us. I... I should. Well, I'm I'm over here. You have a good night. Thank you. Get some rest. Good night. Who found time to decorate? The Mayor had it set up for us when we arrived. Alright, let's focus. We need to knock this event out of the park. And we will. We agree with the publishers to market "Me First" as much as we can and increase your public visibility. Remember your second book. It didn't sell well, I know. Now, about this event. Who do are we flying in to produce it? Bridget? Here are the local producers. There's not many... Wait, wait, wait. Locals? Yeah. The publishers want us to hire locally, generate some opportunity in the area. Get you some human interest press coverage. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. I'll set the appointments. Also, I know it's not your favourite subject but we should talk about this year's Christmas gift list. Right. Christmas gifts. For my brother David and his family. Let's get them really high-end stuff. A watch for Suzy, the latest sneakers for the kids... That's what you got them last year. And for David? I don't know. I don't even know what he likes anymore. When was the last time I saw him? When mom died? You know what? I'll take care of it. Just find me a reliable producer. I'm on it. Your family and friends sure are lucky. I'm sorry? It's just that these gifts are really, really nice. Yeah, well, if you can't give time, give gifts, right? So do you want all of these wrapped and delivered to you? Yeah, that would be great. Thank you. We're really excited to have you back in Fall Oaks. Your books have truly inspired me. Yeah? Your first book, by the way, is my favourite. "Spark the fire within." Ever since I read it I've been dying to go to one of your big seminars. That's great. You should come to the one we're having in a couple of weeks. I'd love to but it's so expensive. Who knew inspiration costs so much, huh? Excuse me? Hey. Santa or snowman? I'm sorry? Which one's better? The the big guy or the other big guy? It's for a festive Christmas sweater party, I thought I'd wear a tie. You know, buck the system. I'm thinking the snowman kinda brings out my eyes a little bit more, right? But green golfing Santa with the scuba reindeers really snubs its nose at convention, doesn't it? I guess I would go with the Snowman... Snowman, right? Yeah. Right? Yeah. Ok, snowman it is, I think. Thanks. Sure. I'm Jack. Rachel. Yeah. Yeah. Nice to meet you. Hi. Welcome home, right? Yeah. Are you from Fall Oaks? No, no, no. I'm... I'm from Boston. Snowman tie it is. I have to get this. It's a work thing. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Jack. Hey. Rachel, hey. I think I found the perfect producer and the publishers are on board. Good. Wait, where are you? No, I'm just leaving the store now. Please tell me you didn't buy David socks. Ok, goodbye. Oh, goodness. Are you ok? I'm ok. Are you ok? Yeah, I think I am. You just saved my life. Well, I just did what anyone would do. No, I'm serious. You just saved my life. Is there anything I can do to thank you? You just did. You don't owe me anything. No, please. Is there anything I can do? Seriously? You can help someone else who needs help. Wha... what's your name? Joy. My name's Joy. Why didn't you return any of my calls last night? What happened? Bridget, can you grab me an ice pack please? Of course. Thank you. Ice pack? I almost got hit by a car, Stuart. What? Are you... what? Wait. Why didn't you call me? I'm fine. But I wouldn't have been if someone hadn't pushed me out of the way in the nick of time. Who was it? Her name was, Joy. Joy? Yeah. She have a last name? We didn't get that far. Christmas Joy Saves Rachel Kennedy. I can see it. We can use this. Are you serious? Of course I am. This is real life, Stuart. Some random person came out of nowhere, swooped in, and saved me. And, you know, I just can't stop thinking about the whole thing. I just feel like saying the words "thank you" isn't enough. I'm sure your "thank you" was plenty. Wanna know what she said to me when I asked what I could do to thank her? What? She said "help someone else who needs help". Does she know who you are? That's not my point. You are helping people every single day. Every book release, every seminar you give. Am I? Am I really? I mean, would I have done the same? So you wanna run around town saving people from oncoming traffic? Thank you. Look, I understand that you're feeling a little emotional right now, but we have our biggest live event in less than two weeks and I have our new producer waiting for us in the conference room. Wait, what? Right now? Yes, now. So who am I meeting? The top local event producer who's also done some major work out of town. The publishers think he can deliver exactly what we need. Great. What's his name? Rachel, I'd like you to meet... Jack. So how did it work out with the tie? It was a big, big hit. Wait a second, you two know each other? Yeah, yeah, we go way back, like yesterday. Right. Jack needed my professional opinion at the store. My, you were busy yesterday. Jack, do you have your resumé and a sample of your work? Creative producer for live events, tour events and even some of my favourite music. What're you doing in this town? I guess you never know where life takes you. And who is... who is Paul Taylor? He's my associate. You know, right-hand man. You'll meet him soon enough. A portfolio like this means you must be... married to your job? Work never complains about my commitment issues. At least you're honest. Why don't we... why don't we sit down? Great. Now, let me be honest. No one knows my brand better than I do. Right. Can I tell you why I took this job? I see potential in your event. That it can really make a positive impact on this town and beyond. Potential? I mean, we're already making a positive impact. Researching you for the last 48 hours, there are a few things that I suggest doing differently. I told you the red suit on the cover made you look a little standoff-ish. The suit's the least of your concerns. Can I be completely candid with you right now? So that was you not being candid? I saw you on the news the other night. Even answering questions, it just... it felt a little too planned. Too clever. We do have a strategy when it comes to selling Rachel's new book that we don't wanna deviate from, which is why the Rachel Kennedy's Inspiration Celebration event has to be the best ever. I think the core message for this event should maybe reflect who you are. Helping others. Giving to others. Which means more involvement in the community. In order to inspire you have to connect on a deeper level. What better way to connect and to celebrate than by making this event more about Christmas than about some... some image? May I also suggest adding "Christmas" to the title? Maybe calling it "The Christmas Inspiration Celebration"? Right. Well, see, Christmas is not necessarily my forté. Ok. Maybe I'm not the best person for this job. Maybe you're right. Ok. Well, I wish you the best of luck with everything. Thank you. I hope it all goes well. Wait, no. Jack, just one sec please. Rachel, can I talk to you for a moment? Yes. Thank you. We'll just be a minute. Hey. What're you doing? I don't like his approach. Look, he's the only person in this town with enough experience to make this event successful. Well, I'm sure we can hire someone else. You saw his resumé. He ran his own company in Boston. He knows what he's doing. Just for now, for the publishers, let's see where he takes this, ok? Ok, we can try to weave a little bit of Christmas into the event. Ok, that's good news. Good, good, good. And see? Look at that. You're already getting into the Christmas spirit. Nice. Ok, we should get started. Started with what? We wanna get you out there among the people, soaking in the holiday... Have you ever been to the town hot cocoa contest? I bet even you can't resist a nice good cup of hot cocoa. Right, see, I've never really understood that contest. I mean, how many ways are there really to make it? I don't know. I guess we're gonna find out because we are going tonight. And you're going with me because this is all your idea. By the way, the only way I know how to produce an event for someone is by getting to know them so from now on you're stuck with me. Fantastic. The coffee is spectacular. Every year they have the best. Yeah, but... can you just... what brought you here to Fall Oaks? Because it seems like you've got a pretty successful career in Boston. This is it. Hot cocoa contest. This is it? Get in there. Ok. How long have you been managing Rachel? I've been with her since her first book. "Spark the Fire Within." About five years now. Five. In our line of work that's like a century. Tell me about it. It's been a little bit of a roller coaster ride. Her second book "You Deserve it All" didn't do as well as the publishers would have liked, which is why we're doing such a huge push on "Me First." And that's why you're here. This event will guarantee that we get our publishing deal renewed. This is the start of Rachel Kennedy becoming a household name across the country. Is that what she wants? Isn't that what we all want? Hi. Excuse me? How can I help you? Hi, my name is Rachel. I am looking for Joy. Well, nice to have you here, Rachel. I'm Dennis, and she's right over there. Follow me. Thank you. Joy, that fruit looks great. I got to the warehouse early. They donated so much produce... Hello. Hi. Well, if you'll excuse me I got a lot of work to do. I'm so sorry, I did follow you but I just... I really felt like I needed to see you again. Could I buy you a cup of coffee? Well, we have coffee right here. But first I have to unpack the bakery goods for the kids. The kids? I missed you, Joy! Oh, Natalie. You saw me yesterday. It felt like a month! Sometimes when we really miss someone it can seem like forever. I missed you, too. I miss all my kids. Dashing through the snow, In a one horse open sleigh, Over the hills we go, Laughing all the way, Bells on bobtails ring, Making spirits bright, What fun it is to laugh and sing a sleighing song tonight How long have you known Joy for? Actually, we just met. She saved my life. Joy has a... tendency to do that. It's her gift. She's been teaching music to these children for many years now, making sure they all leave with a smile on their face every day. Yeah, I can see that. ...one-horse open sleigh. It breaks my heart to think that this is all going away. What do you mean, "going away"? We just don't have the funding anymore. So it looks like we'll be closing the doors at the end of the year. What about these children? I don't know. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way... I guess the reason I wrote "Spark the Fire Within" was to get a grasp on my life. When my dad passed away I... I felt helpless. I had to redefine myself, not just as like a girl with a successful blog, but as a voice for those who were hurting like me. Make yourself at home. I'll just be a minute. Ok, no problem. That's so long ago. As promised. Fresh, hot cider. Thank you. Were you a classical pianist? Yes, I was with the East Massachusetts Philharmonic, briefly, until... Until what? I moved to Fall Oaks. It was not an easy time for me. But when I got here the community centre really helped me through it, so now I help others do the same. I know what's missing. Christmas cookies. Oh, lovely. This was my favourite book when I was growing up. My parents used to read it to my brother and I, all of the time. Does your brother still live here? In Fall Oaks? Yes, he does, but, you know, we... I still haven't had the chance to see him yet. Really? Why not? He I just, you know, I've I've been busy with the event and, you know, everything. I'm sure you're very busy but he's family. We make time for what we wanna make time for, right? This may seem out of the ordinary but I could use your help. With what? The work that you do is special and important. It inspires me and it reminds me of why I wanted to make a difference in the first place. I could just really use your help. I think maybe your idea of helping people, may be a little different from my own. Ok, I understand. If you change your mind or if you need anything, you contact me. Ok. Ok. Do you know how much we spent on that composer? Do you know how much music can affect your audience? So, what? You're saying that I need new entrance and exit music? Yeah. Why? Because it's stale and aloof. And you are neither of those things, most of the time. Excuse me? Look at this. I had to redefine myself... That's the girl. As a voice for those who were hurting like me. That is the message we have to get back to. Where did that girl go? Stuart and the publishers wanted something different. And if my publishers are happy that means that I'm happy. Really? You'd rather make your publishers happy than actually help people who need your help? Ok, fine. What do you... what do you have in mind? As I said, I think we should focus on the Christmas spirit. No. I have already told you, Christmas is not my forté. Why do you keep saying that? Because Christmas is ha... because it's hard when you've lost people that you love. And, you know, being home doesn't help. I'm sorry. No, it's fine, let's just... let's just focus on the event. So what do you... what do you suggest? What do I suggest? Something like... God rest ye merry gentlemen, Let nothing you dismay, Rachel Kennedy has come to save the day! Yeah, maybe no lyrics. No lyrics. Joy is waiting for you. There she is. Hi. You must be Joy. Yes. I'm Jack. Nice to meet you. Hi, Jack. Joy. You came. Anyway, Merry Christmas. Well, Merry Christmas to you. I'll see you tomorrow with equally impressive lyrics. I can't wait. He seems like a really nice fella. Yeah. He is. Please. Yes. I've been thinking about your offer. What is it exactly that you would want me to do? Keep me on track. Keep me on message. Like an advisor. An advisor. Well, you reached out to me asking me to help you and I always try to be there for people who need me, so I'm in. To help you. Really? Yes. Fantastic. I have one condition though. Absolutely. Anything. I want you to join me at the community centre. Well, I'm not sure that I have the time but I was going to tell you that I would love to make a sizable donation. Time is more valuable than money. You're right. What's your estimate, Paul? Looks like they've upgraded their lighting package in here. Yep. Good. We'll start building in the cues tomorrow. Oh man, go home. Spend some time with your wife. My wife and I thank you. We're probably gonna order some pizza. You wanna come? Thank you but no, I got a couple more things I wanna work on. There's a reason you don't have a girlfriend, boss. Take it easy, buddy. See you, man. You really think it's a good idea to have the Christmas party at the place I'm staying at? It'll be perfect. Get everyone out of the office. Don't worry, I'll keep the guest list small. Oh, and by the way, make sure that Joy is on the list. Joy, the woman who saved you the other day? Yeah. And by the way, she is now part of the team. Wait, when did that happen? Earlier today. Why didn't we discuss this? We just did. Alright. Jack? He's taking this "getting to know you" thing a little seriously, huh? Seriously? You're giggling and walking away? Have a good night. Hey. Hey. I'm surprised you said yes. Well, actually, you're kinda saving me. If I had to listen to Stuart go over the party guest list one more time... I... I just thought a little more festival... What, would get me in the Christmas spirit? Yes. You're trying to make Christmas my forté, aren't you? Come on. Ok. Don't be shy with it, really. That's it. I'm trying to but I think that if you push it closer together then it's gonna... Well, no, I am. I'm trying. It's just... Ok, I'm sorry but is he... is he doing this right? Get more in there. I know, I have... That's what I was worried about. If you push it, it's gonna break, and it's ok. It's more fun to... it's more fun to eat than to build with. I don't think this is baked. It's not baked? I don't think it's baked. Is it even edible? No. Let's go get something to wash that down with. Hi there, good evening. Two Christmas Tinsel Teas, please. Christmas Tinsel Tea? I saw you both from across the way. We have a problem and I need your help. What? One of the teams in the candy cane relay had to cancel last minute. The candy cane... The what? The relay. Would you two mind jumping in? I don't think... Candy cane relay? Yes sir. Wonderful. Yes. Ok. So what you're saying is that I'm going to spin around on this candy cane five times and then I'm gonna run down there to that big candy cane and go around that candy cane, come back here, I give you the candy cane and then... And then it's my turn. Your turn. It's called a relay. It's like a relay bad idea. Ooh, impressive. That was... wow. Alright, ready? Set! Ho, ho, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Ok, slow down, not too fast, not too fast. You're gonna focus on something stable when you come up. How many has it been? That's it, that's five! Go, go, go! Easy, easy, easy, easy. That's it, that's it. Go, go, go! Go, go, go! That's five, that's five, that's five! No, no, no! Go this way! Go this way! Go, Jack! Go! Yes! We have our winners! Oh my goodness. I think I'm still spinning. Me too. There you go. Well, this is me. Oh, no. What? No decorations? You're that house? You're that house. This won't do. What won't do? Fire it up. Ok. Ready? Bam. Oh yeah, look at that. We got lots to do. Come on. Let's go! It's a good looking tree. Yeah. I actually think that this might be the best one that I have ever had. Actually, when I was young I used to always choose the tree that I thought that no one else would ever want. You know, so that they would have a home for Christmas, too. And my whole family would always laugh at me but those misfit trees always came home with us. I think that's awesome. Yeah. It's been a long time since I've done this. Since my dad passed away. And he had a knack for gaudy decorations. He had one of those plastic Santa Clauses that came up from the chimney. Oh yeah. I know the exact one you're talking about. Right? Yep. I swear that any plane that passed by could see that monstrosity. And he was so proud of it. I haven't thought about that in so long. You know, losing my mom and my dad and the memories they created for my brother, David, and me. I miss that. I miss that a lot. But it's nice being able to remember it and actually smile about it, you know? What about you? Was Christmas like a... a big deal in your family? Oh gosh, yeah. It sure was. Was? Past tense? I lost both of my parents, too. I'm so sorry. Thanks. It was it was hard for a long time. You know, not having... not having any family anymore. And I was an only child. They were both older when they adopted me, so... You were adopted? Yeah. When I was a baby. My parents were... they were amazing. They never made me feel like I wasn't part of them. But I still wondered. What do you wonder? Just, you know, where I came from. My biological parents. Who they were. Why did they give me up? Just... you never stop. I didn't. Do you ever think about trying to find them? Sure. Yeah, a lot more now. Since mom and dad passed the idea of having family out there... you know, makes it feel a little less... a little less alone in this big world. Yeah. So yeah, I do wanna find them someday. Rachel Kennedy, I'm telling you, if this event tanks we can definitely fall back on our interior decorating skills. Or, you know, we could also maybe go pro in candy cane relay races. You know, I... I have this rule about getting involved with people that I work with. Yes. It's absolutely fine. I... there's... we have a lot to do. Yeah. You know, work always comes... first. I got it. David, hi. Hi. I was wondering if you'd ever come by. Yeah, I was just waiting for the right time. Oh yeah? How long you been in town? Oh, right. Well, I'd invite you in but Suzie and I were about to take the kids to school. It's the last day before Christmas break, so... David, we gotta go, we're late! Right. Right, yeah. Yeah. I'll let you go. I'm... I shouldn't have come by unannounced, anyway. Well, it's good to have you back, and good luck with the event and everything. Thanks. Okay. And I'm I'm having a Christmas party, you know, if you were around and you and the family wanted to stop by. David! David, come on! You know, it's a pretty busy time for all of us right now. Right. Of course. Anyway, have a good morning. Thanks, you too. Merry Christmas, Rach. And, it's like I said in chapter four in "Me First." The true path to success is clearing away any unnecessary distractions and putting yourself first. Why do you think airlines tell you to put on your own oxygen mask first? Because if you don't take care of you, how can you take care of others? You cannot make anyone happy until you're happy. When I finally did this for myself my whole world changed. I'm sorry, Joy, what is it? I'm not sure this is the exact kind of message we wanna send at Christmas time, or at any time, for that matter. Right, I know, but this is directly from my book. I think it sounds great. Hey, there he is. Joy, I'd like you to meet Austin Holberg of Holberg Publishing, our publishing house. Hello. Pleasure to meet you. Joy, is it? Yes. I'm sorry, Joy, you were saying? I think we've heard enough. Go ahead. I'd like you to finish your thought. The thing you say about airplane passengers and oxygen? It's counter-intuitive to help yourself before you help someone else. That's why they instruct you to do so. It's an exception to the way people should behave. And Christmas is a time of giving. We all know that. And giving can cause a ripple effect, and I think it... it should be the message that we're sending. That's interesting. I like that. I think I'm gonna... I'm gonna think about that. Rachel? If you'll excuse me. Alright. I'll call you. Rachel, can I have a moment with you please? Just a sec. Austin is one of the most important publishers around. He's flown in in support of your event. We agreed to a plan with him. You need to stick to it. You know, ever since Joy has been around you seem distracted. You know what, Stuart? For years I have been going a mile a minute, always focusing on work so don't talk to me about distraction. Look, this could be our biggest deal yet. All you gotta do is play along with what Austin and the other publishers want your message to be. That's it. Rachel. I will be right there. I will figure something out. Ok. I hope I didn't speak out of line before. No, no, no. Not at all. This is the reason that I have you here. They need me at the community centre. There's a little bit of an emergency. Oh no, what is it? Our annual Christmas party is about to be cancelled. The money just isn't there. The families and the children, they really need this party. You know what? I think I have an idea. Reggie, hey. Good. Listen, I need you to do a background check for me. Her first name is Joy. Dashing through the snow In a one-horse opened sleigh Can you take this for me? This is just delicious. Thank you again so much. ...laughing all the way Hey. Hey. What're you doing here? I talked to Bridget, she told me what you guys are doing out here so I just came by to lend a hand. That's... that's great. Actually I just saw Paul in the kitchen. Oh, nice. He said he was gonna come. Good. I brought some reinforcements, so put me to work, boss. Well, actually, today I'm... I'm not your boss. Ok, what are you? Do you have any kitchen skills? I'm a little bit better at this than the bussing tables. Yeah? Well, then I think maybe you should stick with that. Great. I'm gonna get to work then. Ok. Jack? Yeah? Nothing. You ok? Yeah, yeah. I'm... never been better. Good. Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingle all the way, Oh what fun it is to ride, In a one-horse open sleigh It's so nice of Jack to come by and help out. Yeah. I didn't even ask him, he just kind of... showed up. I've been trying to reach you all day. There's some things you need to sign for for your party. Ok. Well, once I'm done here I'll get to it. But you need to sign for them now. Like I said, as soon as I'm done here I will take care of it. Reggie, what have you got for me? What is that that you're singing? It's called "Christmas Memories." I don't think I know that one. No? Christmas Memories of happy years gone... nothing? Gone by. Nothing. I'll sing the whole thing for you. Oh, really? It's an obscure one. I have this old cassette tape. Some people my parents knew recorded it and every Christmas they listened to it over and over and over again. Yeah, I still have a tape deck just to listen to that tape. You do? Yeah, I listen to it all the time. I love it. It's one of my favourite Christmas songs since I can remember. Well, I like it. It's nice. Do you know what else is nice? What? Today. Today was nice. Yeah. It was. You know what? I... I think you may have missed a spot there. Really? Really? Yeah. Just a little. A tiny little spot. That's weird. I thought I got it all. Wait, no. There's just a little left on you. Do I have something... is there something there? No. No, you're good now. I got it. I'm sorry. I didn't know you all were... I was standing here... No, it's good. Paul said he's waiting for you in the auditorium. He said you all had cues to go over? Cues for the event. Yeah, no, it's good. I'm fine. You wanna... you go, I'll... Are you sure? Yeah, no, I'll finish up here. Yeah, I gotta go. Ok. What? Rachel? Yeah? Do you have any further plans for the evening? No. I just... I have I'm just gonna finish these pans and I just have a little work to do, that's it. Would you want to help me decorate some ornaments? I made Russian butterball cookies. Russian butterball cookies are my absolute favourite. I would love to. Excellent. I used to decorate Christmas ornaments with my mom, my dad, and David. It's actually one of my favourite memories. Have you reached out to David? Yeah, I actually went by his house. How'd that go? Not too well. But, you know, what did I expect? What happened between the two of you? When my dad passed I just had to get away from everything. You know, everything reminded me of him and so I went away as far as I could to Los Angeles and David stayed with my mom. I sent them money. I thought that that was like my way of helping out I guess. I came back for my mom's funeral and then I left again. I think David still holds that against me. Well, you have to make that right. I think it's a little late for that. It's never too late to make things right. If you have even the slightest chance of having family in your life, you don't throw that away, Rachel. You know, sometimes I just... I wish that I could just wake up and have a second chance with David. Don't you know what they say? Every day is a second chance. Hi, you've reached the Kennedys. Please leave a message after the beep. Merry Christmas!! Hey, David, it's... it's Rachel. I... I'm just calling to say that I love you and I'm sorry for everything. Anyway... Merry Christmas. Did you try the chocolate cake? I'm allergic to chocolate. Oh, me too. It's been a pleasure working with you, Rachel. Oh, you too. Hi. Would you like some cheesecake? Yeah. Maybe. I love this suit, by the way. Thanks. This old thing? But I think I'm loving the tie even more. You look sensational. Yeah? So you gonna ask me to dance, then? Yes, I am. Would you like to dance? I thought you'd never ask. So how does this party compare to your fancy LA parties? Not as gluten-free. Actually I think I'm starting to prefer this more. So how does this compare to your Boston parties? Which, actually, I don't think you ever did tell me why you left. Back in Boston I had a bad falling out with my producing partner there and I was done with it. I wanted out from the city, the backstabbing, the fast pace, just all of it, and so I got in my car and started driving and I stopped in Fall Oaks to get some food and everyone here was just... they were just so nice. Right? So nice. And right at that moment that's what I needed so I stayed. Well, I'm happy that you did. Me too. Rachel? Excuse me, sorry. Could I steal you away for a sec? Yeah. I'm sorry. I totally get it. Everyone has to talk to the boss. I'll be right back. Thanks. David. Hey, Rach. You came. Oh, you know, I almost forgot. Oh, Rach. You... you didn't have to. Oh, no, it's... it's my pleasure. It's for you, Suzie, and the kids. Before I forget, the kids made you something. Thank you. It's perfect. So it's been three years since I've seen you, Rach. Three years. Why so long? I... I've just been busy and, you know, wrapped up in all of this. It's like... Suzie and the kids and I don't even exist in your world. Sometimes I feel like I'm being punished. Punished? For what? Because I remind you of mom and dad and the pain of losing them. And I know this town makes you feel like that, too. I'm... I'm sorry. You're busy. You know, you've you've got a party to get back to so thank you so much for the gifts. And congratulations on everything. Thanks. I think mom and dad would be really proud of you. Because I know I am. Morning, Rachel. Listen, I need to talk to you about something. It's... Good morning. Morning. Good morning. We can talk later. I'll come find you, ok? Ok, great. Thanks. Everything is looking just wonderful. Yeah, I hope so. I'm still working on this opening speech and I'm having a really tough time with it. Why don't you run it by Jack? He's the producer. Hey, you didn't happen to see him leave last night, did you? No. We were just having such a great time and then all of a sudden he was gone. I just... I don't know what happened. There he is. Why don't you ask him? All the way across. I think that would be good. Probably two right there. Two right up there. Hey guys. Good morning. Good morning. You ok? You left without saying goodbye last night. I'm gonna go get another breakfast burrito. All good. I just thought I'd leave early. Just keep things professional between us. Right. Yeah. Right. Professional. Hey, who was that guy at your house? With the red hair. Is that what this is about? No. Maybe. That was my brother, David. That was your brother, David. Oh yeah. Were you jealous? No. No. Maybe. I'm sorry. Well, maybe we could finish that dance sometime. I'd like that. Yeah. But first... I might need your help with something. Sure. What is it? You ok? Yeah, it's just been a long time since I've been in there. Oh yeah, this is the house you grew up in. Yeah. I don't know if I can do this. Well, I'm here to make sure you can. Thank you. Hey. Hey. Suzie said you might be stopping by. Yeah. This is my my producer. Hi. Jack. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Well, come on in. Great. Because we are making the world famous Kennedy Christmas popcorn balls. Stop it. You're still keeping up with mom's tradition? Every year. Actually, it is a Kennedy circus in there. Rachel, it is so good to see you. So good to see you. Hi. I'm Suzie. Hi. Jack. Nice to meet you. I wanted to personally invite you to the event. It wouldn't be the same without having you and the kids there. Thank you. Yeah. And also I'm sorry for not stopping by earlier and for not being there for you and the kids. I know that it doesn't fix things but I would really like to be a part of the family again. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you guys wanna hang out for a bit? Yea... yeah. Yes, we would love it if you all could stay. Absolutely. Great. Putting you to work. We can be put to work. Ok, let's go. Come on. Ok. I'll take your coat. Ok, thanks. Look who's here! Auntie! Hi! Oh my god, you're so big! It was a great day. They're good people. Yeah. By the way, I have thought about your idea and I think you're right. We should call it the Christmas Inspiration Celebration. Really? Yeah, really. Wow. Ok. So I should probably go. Stuart's waiting for me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. Ok. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. Three days 'til the big show. Don't stress, it's in good shape. Fingers crossed. Hey. Where were you? I was with my family and Jack. You seem to be spending a lot of time with Jack. And with Joy. I didn't know that was a problem. Well, we do have a problem. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but your friend Joy has a background we should be concerned about. If that gets into the wrong hands it could be some very bad press for us. Joy has an arrest record? Where did you get this? Does it matter? Rachel, my first priority is to protect you. You do understand that, don't you? Good. So what're we gonna do about this? I'm thinking if we drop snow over the front of the audience first and then we can do it again in the back. I think that would be the best if we could kinda tease that out a little bit. What do you think? Ok, and then we can have Santa come over and land on your head here. We could bring some reindeer in... Wait. What? What? I'm just making sure you're paying attention. Are you ok? Stuart showed me something and it's just... been upsetting me all morning. What did he show you? Something about Joy. She did something. What did she do? I guess she stole some money. It was a long time ago. Do you know why she did it? No. I don't... I mean, I just can't have the press get a hold of this. I mean, you know how they can embellish everything and we just can't afford to have bad press with the event and the book release in a few days. Who cares what the press thinks? Just think about Joy and what she's done for you, and who she is now. I know. I know. I... you're right, I'm... just, with all this pressure I just haven't been thinking clearly. Listen to me. Don't worry about this event. It's gonna be spectacular. You think? If it comes from your heart how can you go wrong? Hi, Joy. Come on in. Thanks for coming by. I brought you this. I thought it might give you a little inspiration for your event. The stories in here have always been so precious to me my whole life. I do love the message in that book. I feel uncomfortable, bringing this up, but... Where'd you get that? Stuart brought it to my attention. Stuart. And look, I'm not trying to point any fingers, but, you know, if the press gets a hold of this they're always looking for a good story, especially when it comes to... Your reputation. I understand. I understand, too, that we all do things that we regret. Yes, we do. I had a son. I met his father when he was a conductor at the philharmonic. I was very young. I thought it was love. When he found out I was pregnant I found out it wasn't. I was forced to leave the orchestra. I took a job at a department store, part-time. But when the baby came it wasn't enough. I couldn't get by. I took some money from the cash register. I was caught and arrested. I wanted so much more for my son than I could ever provide. There was this couple, wealthy donors to the symphony, who were looking to adopt at the time and I knew they could give him a so much better life than I ever could. I gave up the only family I would ever have. I've lived with that every day of my life. I wouldn't wish that loneliness on anyone. When I finally got back on my feet I made a promise that I would do everything in my power to help anyone who ever needed help. So here. Life is messy, Rachel. But sometimes, if we get through the mess, we find out who we really are. I'm sorry, I have to go. That one. That one sounds a little low, doesn't it? I'm so sorry I'm late. No worries. We're just wrapping up a few sound things here, make sure we're all locked in for tomorrow. Ok, great. That's one of my favourites. Yeah? Joy gave me this for inspiration. She gave you what for inspiration? The Apple Garden. I love that book. So good, right? No, no, no. That book has been traumatizing kids for decades. I beg to differ. Do you? Ok, Scrooge. Did you have that chat with Joy yet? Yes, I did, and I hate myself for even bringing it up. I've now made a huge mess. Well, maybe go fix it. No, no, no time for fixing. We have the event in less than 24 hours. We have to do run-throughs. Bridget? Look, there's plenty of time. We have all the time in the world for run-throughs. Some things are more important than work. Yeah, you're right. Ok, I'm gonna do it. She's at the community centre. I'll be right back. Ok. I'm so sorry for bringing up your past like I did. I should never have done that. You have been nothing but kind and open to me. The last thing I would want would be to cause you trouble. No. No, you have never caused me trouble. I only see you as who you are today. Please, can we just put this behind us? Thank you. Hey. What is it? How is this photo in the book Joy gave you? This is the exact same photo that my parents had on our mantle. This is me. What? Is Joy... is she my mother? I... I don't know. Did you know about any... did she know... No! All I know is that I... I just found out that she had a son and she gave him up for adoption a long time ago. The photo that you're holding in your hand must be of him. Or, I don't know, I guess of... you. What do I say to her? It's just like you told me. If it's coming from your heart then how can you possibly go wrong? Something hit me when I first saw you. I just didn't know what it was. I looked all over for that picture. I thought I had lost it. Where was it? Where'd you find it? The Apple Garden. It was in the copy you gave to Rachel. Right. I cannot tell you how often I looked at that picture. Over and over and over. It was all I had. I was not allowed to have any contact with you. Do I have brothers and sisters? No. I had only one child. A beautiful baby boy. I've held you, in here, for 35 years. I've made up all these... these stories in my mind about... about why you would give me up for adoption. Was I not good enough? Was I not... You were perfect. You were perfect. I was so young and so... alone, and so unable to give you the kind of life that I... I wanted you to have. Did you have a good life? Have you had a good life? Yeah. It's been pretty good. Pretty good. I'm sorry, this is all... it's just a little too much for me to... for me to soak in right now. I just... I just need to take a little time and... and let it all sink in, I think, if that's... Of course. If that's ok with you. Of course. Take... take all the time you need. Ten percent gain on... that one there? Yeah, I think so. Hey. Joy. I was looking for the piano. I need to clear my head. Would it be ok if I play? Perfect timing. We're just about to sound check it, anyways. Please. Please. Be my guest. So are you still heading back to LA right after the event? I tried to get here on time but... Hey, that's not a problem. You ok? I think I'm in a much better place now, yeah. Thanks. Thank you for... for being there. That can't be. Is that... It's Joy on the piano. No, the... the song. "Christmas Memories." That... the piano, that's the same exact one from the tape I told you about when I was younger. There's a blanket of snow, Covering up the old road, To the house where I was raised, Through the window I see, The lights on the tree, And a glow from the old fireplace, Though it all looks the same, So much has changed, From the way it used to be, Christmas memories, Of happy years gone by, They come back to me, And keep me warm inside, Still those Christmas memories, Oh they mean so much to me, Oh those Christmas memories, Make me cry That's a good one. You think so? We should... that actually happened. We can use that. Oh no. No, no, no. Are you tired? No. Maybe just a little. I'm gonna go score some candy canes to boost our blood sugar. Yes. Ok. Hey. Thank you. You know that I could never have done any of this without you. I couldn't have made it through the last 12 hours without you. Ok. Are we all ready for tomorrow? Yes, and you won't be disappointed. Good. I just sent you a video I took with my phone. It's footage of Rachel volunteering at the Fall Oaks community centre. How's that for a home grown Christmas story? Of course, Rachel did this to strengthen her brand, for us, and for you, the publishers. Are you sure Rachel's in line with this? Of course she is. It's been her plan all along. Did you run this by her events producer? After tomorrow Jack will no longer be needed. Rachel will be back on the first flight to Los Angeles. She will have forgotten all about him. This is business, Austin. Business always comes first with Rachel. Yes. What's wrong? Where are you going? I trusted you with so much. You know how hard that is for me? What're you... what? How much would you exploit for a book sale, huh? You were just using the people of this, using me, to get a better book deal? What're you talking about? You don't know? How about you go ask Stuart? I just heard him explaining the whole thing to Austin. I can't believe I let my guard down with you. Wait... Jack? I finally let myself get close to someone. Now he wants nothing to do with me. Well, he's going through a lot right now. He's scared. Just like you. It means you care about each other. Every day is a second chance. We have, what, 12 hours 'til the event? What're you doing? I am making things ok. With a little Christmas magic. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hi, David. Hi, Suzie. I'm Bridget. Let me show you to your seats. Great. All the new changes are set. I cannot thank you enough, Paul. Is Jack here? Not yet. I gotta get back to the booth. Have a good show. Thanks. Ok. Rachel, what's going on? I've been trying to call you. What did you and Austin talk about last night? I... I sent him a promo package showing how generous you'd been in the community. I never asked you to do any of that. Good to go? Yeah. Your headphones are right there, bud. Is that what you were filming from your phone, Stuart? Sorry, that's... just checking on Rachel's... No, no, no. Don't turn it off. Leave it on, please. Yeah, I wanted to make sure that you got credit for all the charitable works you've been doing. Isn't that what this has been all about? Is that what you think? And what did you say about Jack? Nothing. Look, I think you should concentrate on what... No, Stuart. I want you to answer me. What did you say about Jack? I may have said that after this event we won't need him anymore. Because he's been a distraction and frankly so is Joy. What does it say in chapter 13 in your book? Distractions mean disaster. I trusted you. As my friend. But I was wrong. I was wrong about a lot of things. Rachel, I have always had your back. Yeah, only when it benefits you. I used to be the same way. I think that it's best if we go our separate ways for a while. Have a safe flight back to LA. Okay, here we go! Silent night, Holy night, All is calm, All is bright Hello everyone. I'm Rachel Kennedy! Two weeks ago I asked you to look at yourselves in the mirror. I said in order to be happy you have to make yourself happy first. But tonight I would like you to do something different for me. Look around. Look at the faces on your right and on your left. Those faces. Maybe it's time we started putting them first. At Christmas, and throughout the entire year, we all need a little help. We all need to be reminded that we are not alone. It took a little Joy and a Jack of all trades to show me the true spirit of Christmas. But I think that we should all be living the true spirit of Christmas all year 'round. And Christmas spirit is about giving. Because someone once reminded me that inspiration should never be expensive, so all proceeds from tonight's event, and a portion of book sales will go directly to the Fall Oaks Community Centre. But finally, most important, Christmas spirit is about love. Joy to the world, The Lord is come, Let earth receive her king, I like what I hear. You got yourself another book deal. Thank you so much. Congrats. Thank you. I heard everything you said to Stuart. I'm so sorry. Hey. Christmas spirit is about forgiveness. Get back out there. ...Heaven and nature sing Now who is ready to make this the best Christmas ever? Angels we have heard on high, Sweetly singing o'er the plains, And the mountains in reply, Echoing their joyous strains, Gloria, in excelsis Deo, Gloria, RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
