That's very thoughtful of grandfather. Has she been scrutinized? Most thoroughly. She has been cleared. Consequently, you will be permitted, under proper supervision, of course. To, as they say, date her. Oh, John, this is a great moment in your life. I'm overwhelmed. I should have been prepared for something like this. I'll get you a tranquilizer.

It's like I'm in orbit or something, just floating around, you know? You know, your voice has been called the hottest sound to come along in some time. How do you account for it? Well, first of all, I wanna say that I agree with ya, it's wild. It's a sound that I just can't explain. I just dig it up out of my diaphragm, and it shoots up here in my throat. I untie these vocal chords, and it leaps right out there in space, Jack. I mean, it floats right out like gossamer wings. It's beautiful, daddy, it swings. What do you hope to accomplish in the next couple of years, Jackson? Well, as you can see, I'm very, very handicapped by my inferiority complex. But if I can shake it, I think I'm set. What do you say we give your new record a spin, are you ready? Oh, am I ready, I wanna hear it! Let's do it. Let's put it on! That's wild. ♪ This is my first offence ♪ Handle my heart with care ♪ Gee, how I love you ♪ I hear by the grapevine, things are looking up for you kids. We've got close to $2,000 toward the car. Well, what about my rent money then? I got seven kids and an elephant waiting for something to eat. It's being put in a special account for us. As soon as all the money we need is in it, it'll be turned over to us. Well, I ain't of a mind to wait. Rumors going around it's some singer setting you kids up. That's true. Well, the police got other ideas. They were out here this morning. They think it's coming from this rash of car stripping that's been going on. What'd they do, search the place? Like they were looking for flies in a raisin pie. Mighty disappointed though, didn't find anything. Now, about that dough, Joe. In a couple weeks, we should have it. Well, it'll be a mighty happy day for me. Keep cutting it, kids. Keep cutting it. [sighing] You know, this thing's getting out of hand. They want me to go on a tour of one-nighters. How much money have we got in the bank? Nearly $3,000. I gotta get out of this beard while the getting's good. Even my aunts are getting suspicious. You know, I haven't been home one night in the last three weeks? This whole bit's gotta go. Oh, you can't quit now. Another couple of weeks, and you'd have it made. Look, Gene Vincent is due back in town next week. If the two of you could get together and give one big session, well, then you'd have enough money, and then you could vanish. It's an idea. Jimmy said he could get the high school gym free, didn't he? We should be able to do it. Then Jackson Dallyrimple could vanish. It was sure fun while it lasted. Just fun? [laughing] Those whiskers tickle. Ugh, I'll be glad when I can put this thing down a garbage disposal. Good night. Good night. [car starting] ♪♪ [cuckoo clock chiming] ♪♪ [sneezing] Gesundheit. John Abernathy, stay where you are. I've got a pistol pointed at you. You have no right to come back here and annoy us! I just dropped in to see how things were going. I guess I'll be on my way. That's not Papa's voice. John Abernathy III! That boy on the telephone didn't lie. What boy? He didn't tell us his name. He just told us that you were making a monkey out of the Abernathy family tree. He said you were rolling rocks all over the city. And we demand an explanation. Okay, well, here it goes. [whispering] Just a minute. ♪♪ I hope you don't mind my dropping in. Poor thing, she's hard of hearing. We just have to repeat it all to her. So, I came on in, and I guess that's about it. Well, I'll be-- Caught without a corset. That happened to you once, remember? Shush, Agatha. And you tried to raise the money by rocking and rolling. How perfectly-- Delightful. Idiotic. And dangerous, if Mr. Philpott should ever find out. Really, John, you must stop it. Yeah, well I am. One more farewell appearance, and then Jackson "The Beard" Dallyrimple dies. Poor thing, and him so young. I've got the most exquisite idea. Here we go again. We'll perform at John's farewell concert, too, give it prestige. Give me some ether, and I'll put 'em to sleep till it's over. But John insists. Don't you, dear? Yeah, well-- We'll do it. Just for you. Okay. Good night. Good night. [tires screeching] Mark, I gotta see ya. Listen, the cops were at my place. They went over the joint an inch at a time. I got the same business this morning. I tell ya, we're getting hot, Mark. The main thing, is they didn't find anything. Well, suppose they stumble onto some of the stuff. How are they gonna connect us with it? I don't care, I just want to get them off my back. All right, don't strain. Everything will be all right. [door opening] I understand you tried to queer the Jackson Dallyrimple bit. Who says? There's only one louse I know who would phone his aunts. It's our considered opinion that you're a heel, and that you can make yourself scarce permanently. Take your time though, no hurry. You got about three minutes. [officer] Hey, kid! Am I interrupting something? No, he was just going to show me how to play marbles. Found a car this morning. No wheels, no tires. Figured I oughta tell ya. It is gonna be awful rough on somebody. Just remember it. See you in jail. [wrench hitting floor] Now, about those marbles. You've got a three hour recording session waiting for you. Grab your whiskers, and let's go. Come on. [motorcycle starting up] Come on, Jacko. Let's get out of this nursery school. See you at the hop this afternoon? Yeah. You sure Gene Vincent will be there? Yeah. Hey, I meant to tell you. A guy delivered a harp to the gym today. Said your aunt sent it down. I know it. She says we all insist that she do a solo. Okay, take it easy. I'll see ya, huh? [car starting] Take it easy. A harp solo? [music playing] Ugh, man, that was a rough session. This your car? Yeah? Come around to the back. Go on. Why, what's the matter? Just go around to the back. Now, open it up. Look, I didn't steal that stuff. Somebody planted it. Oh, that'll make a stirring defense. Throw it at the jury. Wait, wait a minute. Let me guess, an anonymous phone call? Whatever it was, you're coming with me. Hey, miss! Come on. John Abernathy's heir, disgraceful. Get our boy out of there. They won't release him till morning. The hop's today. The what?

Them snake eyes will get you every time. A rotten frame up. Don't we all know it? I think about the only thing for you kids to do is pay me off. Four months rent, plus interest, plus care charges. The DA seized the bank account. He's holding it for claims. Now, that hits a low blow where it hurts. Right here. He won't release it till the case is finished. And I was planning on buying a bathtub for grandma, so she could make her own joy juice. All right, it's time for the pro to step in. You kids make yourselves scarce. Go on, get out of here, beat it.
