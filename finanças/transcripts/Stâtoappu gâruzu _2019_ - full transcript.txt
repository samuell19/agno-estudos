I think that 10 minutes will be enough! ﻿Is that right? I'm counting on you ﻿yes! ﻿Alright! ﻿Pardon me! ﻿Umm.. ﻿Hey! ﻿Are you Komatsu Hikari-san? ﻿Hello! Thanks for today! I'm Komatsu! ﻿I'm Minami Hori ﻿Please haue a seat! ﻿Okay! ﻿But man, I was really fired up earlier! ﻿I've heard of Nora the software engineer in Singapore but... ﻿It seems like she agrees with me! ﻿But she can only collaborate remotely though! ﻿If I may have a word, I heard that remote collaboration is very difficult even with experienced people. ﻿Well, if I fail then I just install the difficult stuff into my brain. ﻿I want to speak to you about future development... ﻿What about the risks? ﻿Well...so... ﻿you're the kind of person who wants things perfect huh? ﻿So we have to use technology.... ﻿To save helpless mothers who worry about raising their children! ﻿In other words when the child has a fever Or when they bump their head by mistake ﻿Hold on! ﻿Should we send the child to the hospital? ﻿At this time if there was an expert you could consult with ﻿It would ease your worries right? ﻿First of all you could ask your pediatrician for video consultation! ﻿Then after seeing the situation and asking about the condition... ﻿The doctor can give you further guidance. ﻿Now there are 20 doctors and 267 registered users... ﻿Can I say something? ﻿There are already many precedents for remote diagnosis and treatment. ﻿Like 1 said it takes 24 hours... ﻿We'll also have service for the evening and it'll reduce the difficulty of the operation! ﻿But we don't have enough regular night clinics...this feature lacks achieuablity... ﻿That's it! There it is! ﻿"Achieuablity" huh? ﻿I will explain it soon! ﻿Don't interrupt me! ﻿Hold on! ﻿If Nora joins... ﻿Then development costs will go up. ﻿What entrepreneurial plans are you talking about? She has no common sense... ﻿She's unreasonable.. ﻿Man, I'm tired! ﻿Hikari'San? ﻿That man is hard to deal with! ﻿I was going to continue the topic... ﻿What was it? ﻿Several investors have expressed interest. ﻿They are all very interested in your idea. ﻿Thanks for introducing the doctor to me! ﻿Hi! ﻿Huh? What was his name? ﻿Tamiya sensei. ﻿yep! That's right! I came up with the idea after being introduced to Tamiya sensei! ﻿I'm grateful to you Mizuki! ﻿Hikari-san! ﻿It is your duty to remember people's names! ﻿A name is something very important to a person like sushi and rice... ﻿your catchphrase! ﻿But you know what? ﻿Wouldn't it be great if everyone's name popped up above their head? ﻿Maybe that could happen... ﻿It won't! ﻿It would leak personal information! ﻿If only I could do it! ﻿Here! Thanks for waiting! ﻿Thank you ﻿What's up with your gloomy face? ﻿It's my student loan... ﻿I still have to make 201 deposits. ﻿I'll be in my forties when I pay it off... ﻿Think of it as investing in yourself, you got into a good company after all. ﻿What should I do? ﻿It was 300 million! 300 million! ﻿That's amazing ﻿I'm still talking about work after work. ﻿I don't get it... ﻿Thinking of complex stuff will make the rice taste bad! ﻿Where's your "Thanks for the food"? ﻿Thanks for the food! ﻿Eat up! ﻿Have you borrowed student loans? ﻿I haven't. I didn't go to university. ﻿Is that right? ﻿Tamiya-san! ﻿Can you think of any way to increase the number of registered physicians? ﻿If this continues on until December than less than 300 will be registered! ﻿you have to deal with the ones you have! ﻿There's fewer pediatricians anyways. ﻿It's not realstic to add more people! ﻿There it is! ﻿you're no fun! ﻿The current number of 20 registered doctors can handle it. ﻿That's the minimum amount of people! ﻿Even a fool can gather that much! ﻿Change your mind! ﻿They're just not in the hospital! ﻿Ones who are on maternity leave or are retired are fine! ﻿And there's a lot of them who can't find jobs right? ﻿Working from home is okay! I'll leave it to you! ﻿Alright! Dismissed! ﻿I forgot my bag! ﻿Later! ﻿Minami Hori! you should expand your network. ﻿Okay! ﻿Oh, AR! ﻿Thanks for waiting guest number to! ﻿Why are you so scary ﻿Hello! ﻿Don't you think it's weird? ﻿There's all these dudes but I'm the only one without a boyfriend! ﻿Why don't you take the initiative and choose one you like? ﻿Isn't that too shameless and cheap? ﻿Wouldn't it be nice if we could see if someone was single or not? ﻿In that case all personal information would be leaked! ﻿Hikari? ﻿What?' ﻿That's right! I've got it! ﻿What? ﻿Let's suppose that a guy who wants a girlfriend logs into site A ﻿Then you get the location information of the registrant using the special map application. ﻿Then use AR technology to visualize whether he is single or not. ﻿Free! ﻿No, that's too plain! ﻿Doesn't have a girlfriend. ﻿* ﻿ ﻿I got it! Yearning for love! ﻿Only those who really want to fall in love stay logged in! ﻿We don't need you! ﻿Then there is the pairing function ﻿it will notify the user if it exceeds 8O%! ﻿What other conditions are needed? ﻿Their lecture notes are similar. This will come in handy! ﻿Then they can have a chat like this! ﻿That's good! That's really good! ﻿There's no need to waste time testing each other and they can easily speak to each other! ﻿Let's make it! ﻿Thanks for waiting guest number 19! ﻿Is there any good guys out here? ﻿Then you're not an entrepreneur. ﻿Umm...I work in an investment company. ﻿yeah, I'm an investor too. ﻿Oh, is that right? ﻿It is very interesting to find entrepreneurs who are suitable for investing. ﻿I see! ﻿Please take care of me. ﻿Pardon me! ﻿But most people who start a business want to do it alone. ﻿This is pretty accurate. ﻿It's hard for others to keep up with their thoughts. ﻿Can we talk together? ﻿I'm leaving actually... ﻿No, no, no I heard that you're from the Nihon Pegasus company. ﻿yes. ﻿I'm Mizuki the owner here. ﻿I'm Minami Hori from Nihon Pegasus. ﻿Have a seat. ﻿A few days ago somone named Komatsu Hikari visited your company right? ﻿Komatsu? ﻿That strange girl? ﻿Actually, I'm assisting the entrepreneurial project she started. ﻿She's quite strange indeed... ﻿Recently there's been an increase in students starting businesses like her huh? ﻿Entrepreneurship is now an optional way out after graduation. ﻿Even people like you who work for a big company share the same risks as those who start a business. ﻿The myth of life-long employment and no worries for a lifetime is collapsing. ﻿If that weren't the case then the term "Social animals" wouldn't be born. ﻿Oh no? I did it again! ﻿I have a bad habit of saying stuff without thinking of the other person's feelings... ﻿I left a bad impression on you huh? ﻿No! No! you must be disgusted by me huh? ﻿No! It's fine! ﻿Umm.. ﻿Do you like playing table tennis? ﻿Alright! ﻿Good work! ﻿Here! you can have it! ﻿Is that okay? ﻿I don't need it? Here! ﻿How was it? ﻿There are a ton of people who want to sign up for this app! ﻿you're a god Hikari! ﻿you can finally get a boyfriend! ﻿yoshiro! Why are you laughing? ﻿your programming level is no good! ﻿What did you learn during your internship? ﻿Sorry... ﻿What am I going to with someone that has a limited skill level? ﻿The conclusion is that we don't need you. you're fired! ﻿Umm.. ﻿Did you talk to me because I was from Nihon Pegasus? ﻿If I said it wasn't for marketing then that would be a lie. ﻿So whether it's starting a business or working... ﻿Isn't it all the same? ﻿But the mood is very relaxed. ﻿It's simple. ﻿Every burger I eat isn't for the company but for myself. ﻿fire you bad at these gatherings of investors and entrepreneurs? ﻿It's written all over your face. ﻿That won't work! ﻿Actually my father started his own business and failed several times. ﻿And that's why t look like this. ﻿My expressions are very stiff. ﻿How is your father running his business now? ﻿He died when I was in university. ﻿1 don't think his body could keep up with him... ﻿To be honest I didn't have a good impression of him. ﻿That's why l wanted to go to other departments. ﻿Before I knew it I entered the innovation and development department... ﻿I used to work in a bank before so l understand. ﻿Big companies are strong. ﻿They will not adopt personal opinions. ﻿you seem like a butler Mizuki-san. ﻿How so? ﻿-It's fine! It's fine! How so? ﻿-It's fine! It's fine! ﻿No, I'm curious! ﻿For example...is it the way I dress? ﻿Or maybe the way that l speak? ﻿What is it? ﻿He doesn't get the joke... ﻿Hmm....that's the first time I've heard that... ﻿Huh? What? ﻿What? What you said before? ﻿Look Hikari! your offer is just not good enough. ﻿She hasn't started working yet... ﻿you haven't even started working! How can you talk like that? ﻿The Nora name is something I already charge for. ﻿you treat yourself as a national treasure! ﻿Hikari-san! ﻿The issue is that you haven't explained exactly what you want to do right? ﻿I told her what to do! ﻿What you want! ﻿What's different? ﻿Geez! I don't care! ﻿you don't understand at all. ﻿Thanks for the food! ﻿Thank you! ﻿Good night! Later! Good night! ﻿Huh? ﻿What? What? ﻿you go to the tavern alone? ﻿Umm...this is the way I come home... ﻿Hold on! Hold on! It's ouer there? ﻿That's the way I go ﻿What? What? ﻿Do you Hue near here? ﻿Do you? yep! ﻿Over there! ﻿The luxury apartments? ﻿Where's your house? ﻿It's over there.. ﻿There's very little rental houses huh? ﻿Are you living in a regular house? ﻿Well...I'm considering the asset value. ﻿Real estate is only for debt! ﻿By the way, I spoke to Mizuki~san the other day! ﻿Oh, he told me! ﻿He's strange isn't he? ﻿No...that's you.. What? ﻿Nothing! ﻿Umm...what kind of person is he? ﻿Well, he's a good supporter for young entrepreneurs like us! ﻿Is he an investor? ﻿He's a little different than that... ﻿He said that the company he founded was bought for a large price. ﻿And so he retired early. ﻿Oh yeah! ﻿I thought of a new idea! ﻿It's the "yearning for love" app! ﻿yearning for love? ﻿yeah, at it's core it notifies users for people who are searching for partners nearby! ﻿Do you have a boyfriend Hori-san? ﻿Not right now... ﻿Then you're interested aren't you? ﻿Umm.. ﻿I kinda forgot something... ﻿Is that so? Then I'll let you know when I go to Nihon Pegasus! ﻿I'll give you my business plan then! ﻿Later! ﻿The luxury apartments huh? ﻿The luxury apartments... ﻿I think this works. ﻿It's Komatsu Hikari-san! ﻿Why didn't you report this to me? ﻿Umm...well.. ﻿you taught me that the key to investing is looking at people! ﻿The project is too risky... ﻿That's your prejudice! ﻿But the risk is too high... ﻿That way of thinking is too stiff! ﻿Contact the other party for further information! ﻿Understood.. ﻿What happened? ﻿My child fell down about 2 hours ago and hit his head pretty roughly. ﻿Is there a lump after he fell? ﻿Please point the camera at the child and let me look. ﻿It seems tike it isn't swollen. ﻿It hurt! I understand, yeah, it hurt huh? ﻿I understand, yeah, it hurt huh? ﻿Can I look at his arm again? ﻿Roll up the sleeves. ﻿Can you show him your arm? ﻿yes, thank you! It's around here. ﻿Please move this area around. ﻿Can you confirm if there is numbness or cramps? ﻿Can you move it? ﻿Looks like there's no numbness. ﻿Understood. ﻿There's no paralysis or convulsions. ﻿And his pupils look fine. There should be no issues. ﻿That's good huh? ﻿Thank you! ﻿yes, thank you! ﻿Okay, just like you saw... ﻿Okay! Okay! That part right there is new! ﻿There's direct guidance on the screen and you can give very specific directions! ﻿It reduces the risk of remote diagnosis and treatment and is reassuring. ﻿Also we can provide a higher level of medical service! ﻿Huh? you were here? ﻿I made an appointment at 5pm! ﻿5 pm? At 5 pm... ﻿How long ago was that? ﻿It was 1 hour ago. ﻿Oh, is that so? ﻿If it's not digital she can't read it. ﻿But, I'm glad I was able to see it with my own eyes. ﻿Our company hopes to be able to help your cause! ﻿We are very fond of your business plan! ﻿I don't need it! ﻿I can't feel the willingness to cooperate with you. ﻿Huh? But.. ﻿you should do what you want with like-minded people. ﻿It's not just a matter of money. ﻿we have a right to decide whose funding to accept. ﻿For this company, social welfare is related to improving corporate image. ﻿Sorry... ﻿Don't be concerned with whether they have common sense or not. ﻿All talented people are this way aren't they? ﻿If you get help from Nihon Pegasus. ﻿Then the funds will be very generous and the quality of the project will be very high! ﻿But she just changed her attitude because her boss said something! ﻿Hikari-san! This project... ﻿No way! She's going to betray me! ﻿I don't wanna be betrayed! ﻿I don't want to! ﻿This is Komatsu! ﻿Good work! ﻿I'm sorry about last time... ﻿This Minami Hori from Nihon Pegasus... ﻿Perfect timing! ﻿Excuse me? ﻿Well...Mizuki-San lectured me the other day... ﻿Mizuki-San did? I can't imagine that... ﻿But, he can't force me to work with Nihon Pegasus. ﻿It's my idea, I can do what I want with it! ﻿But, our company really wants to be a partner with you! ﻿yeah...that's true... ﻿Then... ﻿Remember the yearning For Love thing? ﻿I'm looking for an engineer for this. ﻿Excuse me? ﻿A side job huh? ﻿Just take a look at our colleague's request! Please! ﻿A side job might be impossible! ﻿I'll look for investors so just find an engineer! ﻿Excuse me? ﻿I'm in serious trouble! Please! ﻿But the salary level is that of a black-hearted company! ﻿It's impossible! ﻿yeah, no way! ﻿Hold on! Hold on please! ﻿Well.. ﻿If it's a request from Minami Hori ﻿Really? ﻿Thanks! I'll invite you out to dinner next time! ﻿Alright! ﻿Hey! ﻿It's okay! Hold on to it! ﻿I somehow found someone willing to take on the job... ﻿What? I can't hear you ﻿Like I said...l found an engineer! ﻿yeah!Thanks! ﻿Excuse me! I want a bottle! ﻿I can't hear you actually... ﻿Anyways! ﻿Excuse me? ﻿Anyways, I will cooperate with Nihon Pegasus! ﻿Don't worry anymore ﻿Aren't you drinking too much? ﻿Even if you decide to cooperate. ﻿I had to look for engineers everywhere! ﻿What do you mean you're giving up on the yearning for Love project? ﻿I got tired of it! ﻿you do whatever you want! ﻿My job is on the line here! ﻿So what? I like doing what I want to do! ﻿I don't care about anything else! That is all! ﻿I don't want to be like you at all! ﻿Minami Horichi should just be Minami Horichi! ﻿Don't touch me! ﻿I chose this one. ﻿I chose it! ﻿I was the one who ordered this right? ﻿Check the monitor! Anna is here to monitor! ﻿No! That's not true! ﻿Why don't the two of you sing? ﻿No way! ﻿Stop it! ﻿I'm stopping it! ﻿I don't really think that I'm living a helpless life! ﻿This way of life is more suitable for me! ﻿Who are you talking to? ﻿I'm checking out boss! ﻿Okay! ﻿Bye! ﻿Thanks Nora! ﻿Has the contract with Komatsu-san been finalized? ﻿I understand! I'm leaving right now! ﻿Hello? ﻿Why should Iquit? ﻿Because Tamiya-san said he can't work with you anymore. ﻿It was my idea! ﻿He can just leave! ﻿But it was also Tamiya sensei's idea to point out the problems in pediatric medical care. ﻿But you were the one who solved it. ﻿I can't believe it! ﻿What am I doing wrong? ﻿It might be because of your high demands. ﻿Doing it in one step is impossible. ﻿you need to let the company get on track first. ﻿Don't tell me...Nora too? ﻿I explained the situation to her. ﻿Minami Hori-san too. ﻿your ideas are interesting but... ﻿The reality is that you don't have enough entrepreneurial experience. ﻿you never think about the people around you. you can't do it alone! ﻿A company is... ﻿I don't want to listen to you ﻿you betrayed me... ﻿you betrayed me! ﻿Everyone! Everyone betrayed me! ﻿Stop this? This project is discontinued! ﻿We started this project to solve the problem! ﻿If isn't just to fulfill your needs! ﻿Hikari-san! Listen to what I'm saying No! No! No! No! ﻿I hate betrayal! ﻿I hate being betrayed! ﻿Komatsu-san! ﻿Komatsu-san! ﻿Shut up! ﻿you don't understand! ﻿you're just someone who can't do anything without a company ﻿can't do anything? ﻿Then what can you do by yourself? ﻿I rely on my own strength to start a business! ﻿your business just started because someone invested in you ﻿I hate the way that people like you live like bugs! ﻿I heard from Mizuki! ﻿That your father was a good for nothing entrepreneur! ﻿Is that why you're jealous? ﻿What? ﻿Besides why are you in the investment department if you hate entrepreneurs? ﻿you should just quit! ﻿It's a job that was assigned to me! ﻿I can't just choose a job that I like! ﻿But that's just a part of society! It means you're an adult! ﻿Being an adult alone means you can't change anything! ﻿Then what can you change with your selfishness? ﻿Who can you make happy? ﻿Just shut up already! Shut up! Shut up! ﻿That reckless attitude.. ﻿Too reckless.. ﻿She has been engaged in medical related work this whole time. ﻿I think that she is very familiar with this field. ﻿Let me ask for your support once again ﻿After becoming a partner with your company I will try my best to promote this project. ﻿First we will aim to stabilize this service. ﻿I hope that we will be able to see the usage of all 9000 people in the end. ﻿What's wrong? ﻿It's nothing! ﻿It's very stable huh? ﻿This is right isn't it? ﻿Go ahead and continue! ﻿Thanks for the meal! ﻿Thank you! ﻿I wonder why? ﻿I can't be like "Serves you right!". ﻿Doesn't that phrase mean that you're watching someone's tragic end? ﻿Don't you think that it's awful to wish misfortune on others? ﻿That's right! It's bad! ﻿It's violent.. ﻿Is that right? ﻿That's right! ﻿Here! ﻿your dessert! ﻿Thank you? ﻿I don't know the flavor though! ﻿you won't know until you try it! ﻿It can be anything! ﻿Sorry for being so sudden... ﻿Not at all. ﻿I know what you want to say. ﻿ ﻿Why did you make someone else the CEO instead of yourself? ﻿Maybe because I'm behind the scenes. ﻿That's true.. ﻿you are the one who can sell the business you created whenever you want. ﻿What arte you going to do about Komatsu-san? ﻿Didn't you start this together? ﻿If she wants to end things here. ﻿Then she can do so. ﻿you call yourself a supporter... ﻿But you're just like a bystander playing a game ﻿That's too selfish! ﻿Starting it or ending it based on your mood... ﻿Everyone is too selfish! ﻿Welcome! ﻿is one bottle good? ﻿yes. ﻿you're thinking "Serves you right" huh? ﻿I am. ﻿Serves you right! ﻿ ﻿you screwed yourself over. ﻿Are you trying to get into a big company like me? ﻿Those clothes don't suit you. ﻿Sorry but I have offers from two companies. ﻿4 companies have brushed me off though... ﻿I don't have anything good to say to the company ﻿Damn it all! ﻿The project is officially signed to our company. ﻿When I think about it calmly, Mizuki was right, ﻿He's more reasonable. ﻿we have to stabilize the current service first. ﻿And wait for the company to... ﻿How boring! ﻿Komatsu-san ﻿Weren't you supposed to sow seeds? ﻿I thought you were the type that tries their hardest to get what they want. ﻿But like...are you consoling me? ﻿Mot really... ﻿Hold on! Not really... ﻿I don't get Minami Horiichi! ﻿That nickname Minami Horiichi sounds bad! ﻿I've wanted to tell you this for a while but "yearning for love" sounds wack! ﻿yearning for love fits! ﻿you're yearning for love aren't you? ﻿I had a great relationship with a boyfriend 6 months ago! ﻿But now you're living alone in that tattered apartment aren't you? ﻿I live in a luxury apartment! ﻿Now, now, now ﻿What? ﻿I want to kill the me who was worried about you ﻿you piss me off! I'm leaving! ﻿Please put it on my tab! ﻿Go home! Go home! To that tattered apartment! ﻿you are hopeless! ﻿you better not drink this! ﻿Shut up! Go home! Go home! ﻿Thank you ﻿Even though you didn't drink anything... ﻿That Hori! ﻿One bottle please! ﻿She really pisses me off! ﻿Umm...are you angry? ﻿Of course.I thought so... ﻿you didn't even say anything... ﻿I believe that what you said was right. ﻿However, supporters don't just support one cause. ﻿Entrepreneurs right now are very blessed. ﻿Compared to us back then the investment environment is very developed. ﻿But, it's a matter of whether they can be sustained or not. ﻿That's what I want Hikari-san to understand! ﻿yes! ﻿So I hope you can take back what you said about me being a bystander! ﻿Well, umm... ﻿That's what...what I wanted to say. I﻿'ll be going now... ﻿Everyone does what they want... ﻿What was the "Dull love" thing you were talking about earlier? ﻿It's yearning for love! ﻿y-yearning for love? Oh my goodness! Geez! ﻿Good morning ﻿I'm sorry for being late! ﻿It's okay! it's okay! I'm sorry for being late! ﻿you have an afternoon job too huh? ﻿That's right... ﻿I still haven't finished it. ﻿you haven't finished it? ﻿Then do it! ﻿Can I? ﻿We're slow right now anyways ﻿Thank you! I'm sorry! ﻿I'll finish it quickly! ﻿There's not enough time! ﻿There's annual planning, monthly proposals, daily logs... ﻿The infant growth record! ﻿Kindergarten teachers have a lot of work huh? ﻿It's a heavy load! ﻿Have you eaten yet? ﻿I haven't! ﻿Wanna eat? ﻿Good work! ﻿Komatsu Hikari-san came. ﻿Excuse me? ﻿She wanted to apologize for the previous project. ﻿Well, she's the one who made things this way anyways. ﻿I think that if she does start a business in the future then she wouldn't want to get involved with a big company like ours. ﻿y-you're...reading it right? ﻿Hello! ﻿It seems like Anna-chan who works at that bar is a preschool teacher during the day and a single mother.vt ﻿Umm.. ﻿Didn't you come here to apologize? ﻿ ﻿yeah, yeah. That's what I thought. ﻿But right now l have a brain blast! ﻿What is that? ﻿Like I said.. ﻿It's a business plan! ﻿After reading this newspaper I felt like it might be possible! ﻿Kindergarten is on the decline and about to die! ﻿Hasn't someone said this before? ﻿The kindergarten business has always been considered impossible! ﻿I don't know what you mean... ﻿I haven't figured it out either! ﻿Give me some time! ﻿I'm organizing things in my brain! ﻿Anyways, this is about poor efficiency! ﻿Preschool education, kindergarten, and parents! Everyone is looking after the kids in different spots! ﻿If it can systematized so that all of them can be connected... ﻿Then everyone can take care of the children together! ﻿tt can improve efficiency! ﻿Then it can be a ground breaking innovation! ﻿I still don't understand what a brain blast is... ﻿Do you have a miso crab in your head? ﻿A miso crab! ﻿Please don't laugh! ﻿Good morning! ﻿Excuse me! ﻿Hello! ﻿Good evening ﻿Sorry! I'm always late! ﻿It’s okay! It's okay! ﻿Well, you just have to do your best. ﻿Excuse me? ﻿you're doing it too! ﻿Excuse me? ﻿Right back at you...Excuse me? ﻿I want you to help me out..I guess? ﻿Singing time! ﻿Let's start it up! ﻿Play the usual one! That one! ﻿That one? ﻿What is "That one"? ﻿That one! The one I always play! ﻿I know which one! ﻿Please! ﻿That one? ﻿What is it? ﻿What I need is your steadiness. ﻿Optimistic and naive thinking alone will never work. ﻿I understand! ﻿The name of a big company should be a guarantee for welfare. ﻿Did you just brag? ﻿Let me brag a little! ﻿f had to work hard to join this company ﻿you have to pass the verification test within the company huh? ﻿you don't have to tell me! ﻿Think about your crowded and chaotic thoughts! ﻿In order to prove your existence. ﻿She told me "Talking about work after work". ﻿Is that right? ﻿It might be Lemon or Muscat flavor. ﻿It's dignity and freedom! ﻿The conflicting world wants to erase the distorted afterimage. ﻿you have to see your own limits. ﻿On the window with excessive self-consciousness. ﻿There is last year with no date. ﻿Erase it and rewrite it! ﻿This boring scenery! ﻿That unforgettable sense of existence! ﻿Bring it back to life and rewrite it! ﻿your meaningless thoughts are together! ﻿And turned into the driving force that shaped you I'll give it to you if you pick it up! ﻿Let me tell you something Komatsu-san! ﻿All your outfits are super expensive! ﻿And even that shitty hairstyle! It's all nonsense! ﻿you think so? ﻿How so? ﻿We're going to be hit! ﻿Excuse us ﻿I have a very interesting project! ﻿I really want to work with her! ﻿Well, l have some reservations. ﻿We're going to start on it now... ﻿Besides..Minami Hori.. ﻿Is Komatsu-san okay? ﻿That's also a work in progress ﻿I see... ﻿l‘m not quite sure about that ﻿I don't know! These are just my personal thoughts. ﻿Maybe other kindergarten teachers have different opinions. ﻿Umm.. ﻿I can't quite understand it... ﻿What effect will your idea actually haue? ﻿Will the salary increase? Or will the kindergartens increase? ﻿It's better to ask the government for that kinda stuff! -﻿do in front of congress and make a rap for them! -do in front of congress and make a rap for them! -﻿Don't hit the dishes. ﻿Okay... ﻿Preschool! Preschool! ﻿Then.. ﻿What we're gonna do is improve the existing methods. ﻿Like a minor update to the current version. ﻿Updated version? ﻿But more importantly, I have a request! ﻿you don't have to be so polite! ﻿I want to peek inside of your heart! ﻿No, no! I'm not talking about you ﻿That's not right! ﻿Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! ﻿This right here ﻿Are you off work? ﻿I'm going to the kindergarten! ﻿Even if you have reservations I will continue to proceed! ﻿It's off work time right? ﻿Later! I'll be going! ﻿Preschool is not connected. It's not connected. Preschool! Preschool! ﻿Is the main target group of this project, Preschool teachers or Kindergarten operators? ﻿The final group will be the operators right? ﻿No technology has been brought into the park so far...isn't that because the kindergartens are against it? ﻿We need to start with that first. ﻿I understand. I'll revise it again ﻿Hold off on the business plan! ﻿Okay! ﻿I was a little suprised. ﻿Or more like... I thought it was strange. ﻿we help each other when it's needed... ﻿And thank each other when the help is not needed. ﻿It's like becoming friends with your ex-boyfriend. ﻿Wait hold on...you said friends with your ex-boyfriend? ﻿The love is over but you want to meet up again. ﻿I see! ﻿The joke went over his head... ﻿But if that's the case... ﻿Then if you want to restore the relationship... ﻿That possibility has to be considered ﻿It's just an example... An example... ﻿-Please be quiet. ﻿-Please be quiet. -yes, I'm sorry... ﻿yes, I'm sorry... ﻿I'm coming over right now! Just hold on please! ﻿These portion sizes are too weird for a party! ﻿Why don't you go shopping? ﻿What's up with this dirty room? ﻿Where's the electricity? ﻿I cut it off... ﻿They cut it off didn't they? ﻿you haue to pay the utility bills please! ﻿There's something there! There's something there! ﻿It's fine! It's fine! I don't wanna know what it is! ﻿By the way... ﻿I've thought of something amazing ﻿Excuse me? ﻿The reason why young preschool teachers like Anna-chan are inefficient... ﻿Is because you can't make a corresponding judgment on the child's growth right? ﻿They're inexperienced! ﻿But what can be done about that? ﻿Not all preschool teachers have had experience with children. ﻿But if you build a database for children with similar tendencies... ﻿Then when you see it you can understand how to deal with them! ﻿What someone doesn't know is being supported by data! ﻿That's true.. ﻿But the reality is... ﻿I found it! ﻿In the Sparkling Children's institute! ﻿Furthermore it has 40,000 children's growth data! ﻿The sparkling children's institute. ﻿I see. ﻿I understand the contents of your business plan. ﻿your database of 40,000 children is essential to our plan. ﻿If you allow us to use it... ﻿I'm sorry but I can't lend it to you. ﻿Well, I think your idea is very interesting. ﻿How ever, I have a difficult time understanding it. ﻿you and your business partner... ﻿How can I say this? ﻿I guess you can call it inherent qualities. ﻿I can't see them at all. ﻿How did it go with the investor you contacted earlier? ﻿He rejected me as soon as we met... ﻿I'm talking to a few venture capitalists right now. ﻿We can only push forward on the ground huh? ﻿Is Minami Hori-San okay? ﻿She just started asking around right? ﻿That's not it! ﻿Do you think it's okay that I'm dragging her with me? ﻿Does that mean that you're worried about someone else? ﻿Please stop that. It's gross ﻿Will she disappear suddenly? ﻿Will she betray me? ﻿Why do you think that? ﻿I mean, I'm... ﻿Me.. ﻿That way of talking is unique to you ﻿But...why don't you just leave it at that? ﻿This industry is about to fall apart. ﻿It's scrap and build! ﻿Destroy everything and show me your future please! ﻿Do it myself? ﻿If you allow us to use this system then we can improve the efficiency of preschool education... ﻿If everyone uses this then the data will increase gradually. ﻿I don't really know what's needed... ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿Okay... ﻿Sorry for not being able to help. ﻿It's fine! It's fine! ﻿I'm sorry for keeping you so late! ﻿It seems like it's raining. ﻿Be careful on your way home. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Thank you so much! ﻿Pardon me! ﻿Hello? This is Minami Hori. ﻿I couldn't reach you at all! ﻿What were you doing? ﻿Excuse me? ﻿I've been working hard too! ﻿Working hard at what? ﻿you don't think that hard work alone will do it right? ﻿I don't see the results at all! ﻿Sorry about that! ﻿If this goes on then there will be no progress at all! ﻿Think about it! ﻿Good work. ﻿Good work on your end as well! ﻿Umm...Komatsu-san called me over... ﻿I'll bring you something. ﻿Please wait. ﻿She's not coming huh? ﻿She wants you to do a lecture. ﻿A lecture? ﻿She doesn't want to visit the kindergarten... ﻿But she wants the preschool teachers to come. ﻿It's Hikari-san's idea of improving efficiency. ﻿However, she couldn't be there on time ﻿And so I'm looking for a venue that's close to her apartment but ﻿What is Komatsu-san doing? ﻿The project hasn't even passed the company's written request... ﻿And I also run around outside work. ﻿Please believe in her! ﻿I didn't believe in my partner and left the career. ﻿I wanted to move forward but gave up before the goal line. ﻿I think she's like a Typhoon. ﻿After the storm... ﻿There will always be a clear sky. ﻿The door isn't locked.. ﻿Komatsu-san? ﻿I'm coming in... ﻿you called me over... ﻿Kotnatsu-San? ﻿you forgot to eat... ﻿is that something you normally forget? ﻿Alright, go to sleep. ﻿There you go. ﻿Alright. ﻿Gross.. ﻿Buy me some potato chips... ﻿No, potato chips are forbidden! ﻿Then give me popcorn! ﻿it's the same thing! ﻿I'll go buy some stuff, go to bed! ﻿Too difficult... ﻿Alright! ﻿Looks good... ﻿So dirty... ﻿Preschool education questionnaire... ﻿When did she make this? ﻿How would you like to arrange working hours? ﻿Time to play with children ﻿Children's growth ﻿Children.... Orginally... The childfren say"I like the teacher" ﻿Mo, no...it's the same isn't it? ﻿Thanks for the food. ﻿you've been here several times huh? ﻿Sorry! ﻿But I've been thinking about it! ﻿Put these inputs in. ﻿I wondered why I'm so busy with this. ﻿The reason is because a preschool teacher I know complained about the system to me! ﻿She always has to work overtime! ﻿And she's always late to her part-time job! ﻿There's nothing that can improve her work efficiency! ﻿Efficiency huh? ﻿Is that why you want to use our database? ﻿But improved efficiency isn't to help the teachers feel more at ease! ﻿This is a questionnaire for preschool education! ﻿Please take a look! ﻿Everything here is about the children and for the children! ﻿Umm...Umm.. ﻿Introducing this new system is for the children's sake! ﻿we hope by improving work efficiency... ﻿We can extend the time spent with the children, even if it's just one minute extra! ﻿That is.. ﻿The wish of preschool educators! ﻿Sano-kun! Let her see the database! ﻿Okay! ﻿Can I show you this? ﻿Thank you? ﻿Please wait! Go ahead. ﻿Okay! ﻿I got the database of 40,000 children! ﻿Geez! Finally? ﻿What do you mean "Finally"? ﻿It's just been me... ﻿Thank you for the preschool education questionnaire. ﻿if it weren't for that then I would have just focused on improving efficiency... ﻿Several investors have become interested! ﻿Really? ﻿H's such a mysterious thing! ﻿Entrepreneurship planning is mature in the process of looking for investors. ﻿Nothing is meaningless! ﻿So you've been moving too huh? ﻿Hey..I only move when I need to! ﻿When l don't have to, I don't! ﻿Don't move wastefully! ﻿I'm different than ordinary people like you ﻿Excuse me? ﻿I mean that's true right? ﻿you run around like a little doggie! ﻿Saue yourself some gas money ﻿I'm furious! ﻿Give me back my humility! ﻿Drink up. ﻿yeah... ﻿you drank my drink from the other day right? ﻿yep.. ﻿Here! Thaks for waiting! ﻿Then we can just prepare the projector screen and mic on that day. ﻿Nope, we don't need a microphone stand! ﻿She's not a person that needs a microphone! ﻿Alright, let's do this! ﻿Oh, okay! ﻿Alright! ﻿Umm.. ﻿This'has passed. ﻿However! I'm not sure if I can bring to yamada. ﻿Thank you! ﻿Thank you! ﻿Alright! ﻿Where's Komatsu-san? ﻿She's not answering her phone. ﻿I have an ominous feeling ﻿She's not planning on skipping out on it right? I﻿'m going ﻿If she doesn't make it then I'll leave it to you ﻿No,umm.. ﻿Stay here! ﻿It's frustrating but it has to be her... ﻿What are you doing? ﻿The information for the lecture is not comprehensive enough... ﻿But you have to do this while walking! ﻿I can't do it while walking! ﻿I understand! I'll do something about it! ﻿Are you sure? ﻿are you going in that? ﻿you can't go in that! ﻿Why not? ﻿Don't you have any formal clothes? ﻿That doesn't improve my speaking ability... ﻿Investors might not care about it but... ﻿But the kindergarten operators will definitely care! ﻿I know! ﻿Because I'm an ordinary person! ﻿Here ﻿Hey! Stop shaking me! ﻿I can't! ﻿The moment when someone thinks it's impossible they lose! ﻿What did you just say? ﻿It's impossible! ﻿Hold on! Hold on! ﻿you're shaking like crazy! ﻿It's okay! ﻿why did you let go? Hold on! Hold on! ﻿it's heavy! -Hurry up! No way! ﻿Please help me with this! ﻿you're kidding... ﻿Sorry for the long wait! ﻿Thank you for coming here with your busy schedule! ﻿Now, we are going explain and set up "Child Space". ﻿Now, let us invite the presenter Komatsu Hikari-san to the stage! ﻿Hello! ﻿Time is very limited and fleeting but... ﻿What we want to do with Child Space is... ﻿Reduce the burden of preschool education! ﻿And let parents feel more at ease! ﻿And create a society that is closer to children! These three points! ﻿I wish she would introduce herself... ﻿My preschool teacher friend is always late to her side job! ﻿And I asked if her children were already home! ﻿Why do you have to work overtime? ﻿She replied that she wanted to work. ﻿you should improve your work efficiency! ﻿So then.. ﻿Right here is the data for one child! ﻿you can't see it right? ﻿So here we go ﻿Everyone can see this data right? ﻿This is sharing! ﻿In life there are many things that everyone shares on the internet for granted! ﻿I think use need to make the change from there! ﻿If it can be systematized... ﻿Then we can share the information together! ﻿Also we can hand things over and realize things! ﻿This is reducing the burden of preschool education! ﻿The burden of preschool education is reduced... ﻿So where is the "Parents feel more at ease"? ﻿Aren't they worried? ﻿Aren't they anxious? ﻿Are my children adjusting and growing? ﻿I mean there are a lot of preschool educators who have never been mothers! ﻿Will they be able to take good care of my child through work alone? ﻿That's it! ﻿This is owned by the Sparkling Children's institute! ﻿They have a total of 40,000 data of children across the country! ﻿All of this is right inside here! ﻿If we have all of this data... ﻿Then we can respond to parenting consultation!. ﻿If we can do that then the parents will be at ease and satisfied! ﻿Umm.. ﻿And lastly... ﻿And improving efficiency might sound a little cold ﻿you might feel like there's no love but... ﻿There's someone who has been waiting for this extra time! ﻿The ones who have been waiting for this time spent with the parents and teachers are the children! ﻿And being able to hold their hands and guide them is something of irreplaceable value! ﻿We want to create a society that's closer to children! ﻿umm... ﻿It would be good if everyone entrusted the kindergarten to take care of their children! ﻿That's enough. That's all! ﻿Thank you! ﻿It's so damn hot! ﻿Ouch! Hey! ﻿What was up with that final speech? ﻿What do you mean final? ﻿Why? The mood was going well! ﻿The last word is the most important! ﻿Then, how about you try presenting? ﻿But.. ﻿Can you do it? ﻿Shut up! That's not what this is about! ﻿That's exactly what its about! ﻿I'm glad you wrapped it up with polite speech... ﻿Right? ﻿But like it's cold. Give it back! ﻿Didn't you just take it off? -﻿It's cold with these clothes! Why are you like that? ﻿- It's cold with these clothes! Why are you like that? -Okay! Okay! I understand! ﻿Okay! Okay! I understand! ﻿Is this it? ﻿That's right! ﻿The children's information is in there! ﻿Oh, there it is? ﻿And then we'll formulate a guidance plan suitable for the child's growth! ﻿This is so simple! ﻿It's very reliable! ﻿Right? ﻿It shows the work flow of a day in preschool and has many other options! ﻿you take a lot of pictures in preschool right? ﻿So we thought that it would be nice to upload those photos! ﻿That makes me happy! ﻿First we need a representative of the management team to get written consent of the investor... ﻿Without the director having to resign from his current company. ﻿And when the term expires they must not refuse to be re-elected as the director of thejssuing company. ﻿Second the members of the mangement team specialize in the business of the issuing company.. ﻿find must not be in other companies as a part-time director or employee... ﻿Please put this in an envelope! ﻿I will... ﻿Komatsu-San! ﻿This is something important! Hold on to this! ﻿Okay, it's over! ﻿Please take it and look it over. ﻿Then decide whether to sign a formal contract or not! ﻿Okay! ﻿But like...please get down! ﻿Why? -Please! ﻿It's okay Minami Hori! ﻿It's okay Minami Hori? ﻿you found the best partner didn't you? ﻿Excuse me? ﻿Hey... ﻿yes? ﻿I give up! ﻿yep, that's you... ﻿Not gonna retort? ﻿It's okay! ﻿I finally got it. ﻿But like.. ﻿Minami Hori can do it ﻿That's why I want to leave it to you ﻿I think that you're better at continuing what you made than me! ﻿I think you're amazing. ﻿When I think of something interesting then I'll come and see you ﻿Come and see me! ﻿Later! ﻿Later! ﻿I'll see you again when that time comes! ﻿Alright!
