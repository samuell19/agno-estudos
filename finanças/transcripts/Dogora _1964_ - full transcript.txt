Calling Base. 9A3 point 4, 8 North. 1, 5, 6 point 33 east. Over. Roger J.Q.W.S. Contact G.M.T.I.O. 2,1 point 4,1 point 0,8. Over. Check point HX3. The satellite is passing over. In orbit, no correction. Courser operation's normal. Pulse is okay. Not bad, eh? We can enjoy a view of space from the comfort of this room. Don't get too comfortable. Mr. Kirino, it's passing over Japan. The problem occurs in its sixth orbit. What's that? Maybe a flying saucer. - Isn't it just space debris? - Space debris? Space debris doesn't move like that. What's is it, then, Kirino? I don't know. It may have something to do with the missing TV satellites. Ah! What's wrong with the control device? It's not working. DOGORA The Space Monster We have breaking news. TV Satellite L100 from the Electric Wave Laboratory exploded in orbit. Officiary Kirino of the Laboratory is investigating some serious changes... ...happening in outer space. Is something wrong? - Can't a girl sit in her car at night? - Sure she can. What then? My car radio is turned down. I'm not bothering anyone, am I? You're right. But may I ask what you're doing here so late? No, you may not. I'm sorry. So what's her story? I think she needs a man. Ouch! What's the matter, cop? Why'd you throw me out? Have manners when you carry me. I got you. Come on! Calling the sub-branch office. This is the branch. Over. This is the sub-branch. What about the cops? They're gone. Will you be much longer? We're not digging in the sand here. It requires patience. Keep an eye out for us. It's okay. Will it be all right? Trust me. I'm a warranted Diamond G-man. Ask! Brother... Quiet! Something strange is going on here. Nonsense! The night watchmen are all tied up. I know that but... You're too nervous. Hey, b-b-brother... Shut up, you're making me as nervous as you are. But brother, what are you standing on? What? - What happened? - Don't ask! Hurry up! Stop! Come on out! I'll sic my dog on you if you don't show yourself. Well, aren't you a well-dressed thief. I'm detective Komai the from Foreign Section, of the Metro Police Board. But I never called the police. Of course not. I followed your guest to this house. Guest? Is someone else here, too? Stop pretending. I followed someone here. I don't think so. Then, let me have a look inside. All right. Excuse me. I'll come in through the window. Is something wrong? The diamonds are gone. They were in this dish just a minute ago. Turn on the lights. Oh, no! I'm a guest. What? Dr. Munakata... Sorry about this, Doctor. Get in. I don't remember hiring a car. I see. If you insist. The boss does. Boss? So you've finally come to. Such a softie... Drink it. You didn't handle that too well. Don't they teach you detectives how to Karate chop? I never would have guessed he knew judo. Is this your daughter? No, she's my assistant, Miss Masayo Kirino. She understands me best. Stop exaggerating. I'm just a secretary and a nuisance. Secretary? Stunning. I feel like I'm in God's palace meeting a princess. What does that make me, the devil? Young men today, they forget their duties around pretty girls. I didn't forget my duties. He got the better of me. Who the hell is he? Mark Jackson. He claims to be a diamond broker. You heard about the diamond robbery last night, didn't you? Is he the offender? I'm not sure. According to our information, a worldwide diamond ring is on the move. There were three cases of robbery in New York, two in London... ...three cases in Paris. In Rome, Rio... It goes on. But which ones are ours? Just one in Paris was ours. The rest were done by other parties. Who could have done it? It wasn't human. - What do they want with diamonds? - Exactly. A dog or a cat would rather take food. It had to be a dog or cat. It was... It was something soft, fluffy stuff... you saw it, too, didn't you? I bet it was a trick they played on us. Damn it! Curse them! Who is it? It's me... I've brought a guest. Okay. Show him in. You're the boss? Not much of a boss. What did you say? Am I wrong? You're just a branch manager from what I can tell. Who are you? I'm Mark Jackson, jewelry broker. Stop fooling around. There's no man named Mark on the list. Maybe I'm a fake. Are you a fake? Take it easy, take it easy. I came here so we could talk. You're the guy who stole the diamonds last night? Could be. None of your lip! This is the investigation report on the Tenpodo case. These steel doors were melted as if they were made of wax. What kind of energy could do this? - We haven't figured that out yet. - We found an oxyacetylene cutter. That wouldn't melt steel like this. Any other clues? No. Please fill out a report of the damage you suffered. Report? What for? Huh? But your diamonds were stolen. Those were artificial diamonds. Artificial diamonds? Yes, besides, I'm not ready to go public with it yet. I'm still working on it, see? Those were materials used for his research on crystallography. Crystallography? Rocks, nylons, germanium, I study crystals. Diamonds are precious jewels. But I'm more interested in diamonds as industrial materials that will make... ...our lives richer in the future. I see. Do you understand? Yes... sort of. Ha, this must be your first day on the job. No good. They're all imitations. Oh, God! Damn it! I was cheated too. Well, so long! - Where do you think you're going? - What're you trying to do? - Throw him into storage. - Yes, boss. It's about time we get news from headquarters. - Damn it! - You! Yes, I understand. Good luck. Put it away. A big job this time. A big jib? Tomorrow, a boat will arrive in Yokohama with a load of raw diamonds. Are we pirates now? We'll attack them before they ever reach the grindery in Yamanashi. What happened? Were you surprised? Uh, no. I thought I had a good hunch, but I didn't. Why? I figured you'd be living in a quiet residential area uptown. And then... With a potted rose and a bird cage on the window sill? You're quite the romantic for a detective. Don't make fun of me. Anyway, I never expected this... I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I was born here. I'm not exactly a princess. When I was young, my parents would scold me for playing in the coal fields. - Does that surprise you? - Not at all. The Dr. is a world-famous scientist for his research on crystallography. Yes, he's a member of the International Academy. He looks more like a factory owner. Anyhow, I wish he'd be more careful. More careful? He seems to be a target. And so are you. By whom? Industrial spies, according to my hunch. Industrial spies? - Brother! - Brother? Yes, he serves in the Electric Wave Laboratory. Masayo! This gentleman is a detective. He accompanied me here. I'm detective Komai. What's the matter? What's that sound? That's it! What is it? That's what destroyed our TV satellite. I don't see anything. What is it? Don't know... But I know I've heard that sound before. Look! The chimney! Call for back up! Doctor! These flaming sparks here, what could have caused them? I really can't say what until I run a spectral test. It looks to be some form of carbon. Carbon? Hello. Yes, he's here. Telephone for you, Komai. Thanks. Hello? Yes, Komai speaking. When did you become a monster chaser? Mark's showing his face on Ginza street. Nitta's trailing him now. Hello, hello. Chief? Nitta here. He's at the hotel. Yes, I understand. I'll keep an eye on him. Hello, Mark. Oh, it's you. Now we're even. You should really knock before entering. It's not polite. I just want to know what you did last night. I'm sorry, but I don't have the time. Someone's about to leave. Someone? - Be careful with those diamonds. - All right. Well then... You should really be leaving now. I think I'll stick with you. - That's no good. - No good? So who's about to leave? I see persistence is a common trait of policemen all over the world. Wait! Are you authorized to carry a gun? I want you to come with me to the police station. Okay. Wait! Stay right where you are. So long, my friend. Damn it! Everything's safe. Listen. You two aren't rookies. How could two detectives let that guy get away? Sorry, sir. Here's an international dispatch. There was a big diamond robbery in Rhodesia yesterday. An armored truck transporting the diamonds disappeared. Looks like diamond thefts are becoming a regular thing all over the world. One happened right under our nose at Ginza. Do you know what would happen if another robbery occurred? The papers would have a field day! Still safe. It's coming. Calling the sub-branch. This is the branch. This is the sub-branch. Over. It's on its way. Everything is on schedule. Take your positions. We'll be ready. No escort. No protection. This should be a snap. Better play it safe. It's coming! Hey, Sabu. Hold this gun. A hit and run? We can't just leave her. Go and have a look. Me? Someone's gotta stay here. I don't like this. Excuse me. Gotta light? Hello! So, stalling for time, are we? Damn it! Is she dead? She's still alive. She's pretty, too. Okay. This is the sub-branch. Over. - Hurry up! Mark Jackson's on his way. - Hurry up! Mark's coming. Who is it? Keep quiet. I'll shoot you if you make a fuss. Hey, hurry up! He's coming. Hurry up! - Are you a policeman? - I'm sorry. Out of the way! A truck! Let's ram him with it! Stop, stop! Sabu! Run back. Get out. Hurry up! Let's go! Okay. Let's get out of here. Five robbers ran away with raw diamonds. There's no doubt. What's the relationship between Jackson and them? That guy's after raw diamonds, too, but he's not part of the gang. What did you mean by the coal truck twirling through the air? I don't understand it at all. A monster should've appeared at the same time. What is this? We're not looking for monsters. We're after a diamond robbery gang. What do monsters have to do with it? The idea of monsters should not be so easily dismissed. New York had another jewel theft while a large amount of coal just disappeared. So a monster is responsible? I won't jump to any conclusions, but it's the only explanation I have for this. So somewhere out there is a monster stealing diamonds? For what reason? Hello? I've been watching all morning but Mark hasn't come back yet. His luggage is still here. Keep on watching until he comes back. Let me know if anything happens. Any news? The pressroom is over there. Come now, we just want a little information. Information? Is it true that those raw diamonds were valued at tens of billions in Yen? Tens of billions? That's more than I know. You newsmen have a good ear. What else you got? Good one. Something must've happened. City editor's section, no foreign section. Who is it? Masayo? Yes, yes. It's for you, Komai. She wants to have a date with you. Hello. Komai speaking. Komai? Mark's here now. What? Mar... M-My word. Hold on. My personal life is news to you? I don't write love stories. Chief. It's Mark. These pictures are not new to me. They're not? Komai showed me something similar already. Komai? Oh, that crazy detective, huh? Please. Thanks. Oh, Japanese coarse tea. I like it. Do you? Oh, soy beans. Such a delicate flavor. Can you tell me why you're showing me these pictures? It's related to your field of work. Only you can make a machine that could produce strong heat and power. We concluded that after a thorough investigation. We? Yes, the organization I belong to. Ah, so he's arrived. Pardon? You called the detective, didn't you? Hello! Wine delivery! My dear! - Is he still here? - Yes, but... He knows I phoned you. Has he fled? No, he's sipping tea in the study room. Japanese coarse tea? You guys wait outside. Let's go! Hello! Doctor. Why is he here? He brought these. Oh, this and that are from New York. This one's from London and that from Paris... All famous jewelry stores. I'm trailing this new offender. We'll do the trailing. You're a member of the International Diamond Robbery Ring. Good God! Come quietly to the police. You're making a terrible mistake. What? I'm an investigator dispatched from World Diamond Insurance association. I see. That's the organization. You could call me a diamond G-man. My credentials. Why were you running from us? Running? Never. It's not my fault you can't keep up. Why do you carry a forged passport? This is Japan. The success of this mission requires me to be ninja-like. Are you trailing the Ginza diamond thieves? No, I'm not. At first, I was. But then I realized they can't open a safe like this. - You think it's someone else? - Yeah. They can be caught anytime. But these are the ones in question. I'll be happy to cooperate with the Japanese police from now on. We're not a baseball team. We don't need outside help. You're nuts. I don't know where you learned your Japanese, but you had a vulgar teacher. - There's no big paycheck in it for you. - I'll work without pay. - Is this is okay with your office? - I'm a friend of justice. Okay. So long. Okay, open it! Damn fool! What's is it? You've been had. These bags are full of candy. What's so funny? You have a visitor. Brother. What's happened? Doctor, we've discovered the monster's true identity. The Space Planning Committee at the U.N. reported it... In their conclusion, the monster is a cell from space mutated by... ...massive amounts of radiation. A space cell? The committee first became suspicious when those TV satellites started... ...disappearing over the Japanese islands. There's a pocket of radioactivity in the atmosphere over Japan. A certain form of cell that lives there was mutated by the presence of... ...strontium and cobalt. So why does that monster need coal? As an energy source, I would guess. Like food. And as for the recent diamond thefts, the monsters could be behind them? No, no... These scientists must be out of their minds. I don't think so. Why? Coal and diamonds are both carbon, see? How do you mean? A mutated space cell doesn't care if it's coal or diamonds as long as it's carbon. But what happens when the cell keeps on growing? We're fine as long as it's only eating diamonds and coal, but it may... ...eat up everything that contains carbon. If it comes to that, it could mean the end of us all. That's the sound. Get back! This is a special news bulletin. According to a cable dispatch from VFI, King Valley Diamond Mines... ...in South Rhodesia was attacked by the space monster... ...causing massive damage. The giant space cell has been named ''Dogora''. It's been wreaking havoc all over the world. Attention Ladies and Gentleman. A state of emergency has been issued to defend against Dogora. Plans have been made to defend the coal mines of northern Kyushu... ...where the monster is most likely to strike next. The authorities request you cancel any travel to the Kyushu area unless... ...absolutely necessary. Doctor, won't you think twice before you go? My mind is made up. - But if something should happen... - Happen? An opportunity for this kind of scientific discovery only comes along... ...once in a lifetime. Listen. I study diamonds. When a monster comes along turning diamonds into energy... ...how can I turn away from that? - Masayo, shall we? - Right. - Please be careful. - Yes. You're looking quite serious. Take it easy. Where there's trouble, there's money. Chief! Mark Jackson checked out of his hotel. I don't care about that phony anymore. That's it! What is it? - Those diamonds were fake. - Are you feeling okay? Listen! The monster seeks out diamonds and coal for their carbon. The coal truck was attacked. But why wasn't the diamond truck? They were at the same place. That means those diamonds were not real. You see? Maybe you're right. So where are the real ones then? Why did Mark leave the hotel in a hurry? - He must be up to something. - Where was he heading? - He bought a ticket to Kyushu. - Kyushu? Hello! Oh! - How are you? - Mr. Jackson is here. Hi. - Are you going to Kyushu? - Yes. Studying something? - And you? - Me? Just a little business. I'm going there on a little business, too. Oh yeah? - Could I have a word with you? - Go ahead. Don't you want to hold my hand? If you insist. Do you think you can handle those diamonds all by yourself? Two are better than one, don't you think? So? I'm being serious. You're seriously thinking about a double-cross? - I've simply been waiting for the chance. - So where are the diamonds? Stop your nonsense! I know you secretly switched them for fake ones. I know you sent for some sugar crystals at the hotel. Why don't you become a policewoman? So? What do you say? I'm sorry, but I prefer to travel light. Really? Then give me your bag. Oh, no! Believe me, the real diamonds aren't in here. Boy! I want to telephone Tokyo. Right in here, please. PARK STAT I ON Doctor, what are we going to do now? I don't know. The next move is theirs. Fall in. Fall in! Fall in! Wait a minute, old man. This area is off-limits. Please leave immediately. - Just a moment. - Please hurry. You must have bad hearing. I can hear you. I'm a young soldier, see? Oh, Dr. Munakata! Oh, Iwasa! Are you on a crusade? Yes, I'm the commander of the defense corps in this area. What's that? Well... There's a communication from the command outpost. Radar is showing signs of unidentified objects passing over. All right. Keep tracking it. Course 15 degrees. Altitude is 8,700. There's no movement. - Have you identified it? - The target's reflection comes and goes. Could it be the reflection of a cloud or something? It can't be identified. A black stain comes in and out. - Is it the monster cell? - It doesn't look like it. What? No? Can't you catch the sound of it? The sound radar! Route signal to the main speaker. Turn it up! What was that? A bird flew across the sky at a height of 50 feet over the sound radar. - A bird? - That's some bird! Doctor? It's not the space cell. It sounds like a large swarm of insects. But do insects fly at an altitude of 26,000 feet? Send out reconnaissance! Target located. We're closing in. Look! A swarm of bees! There's nothing discernible except a large swarm of bees flying in the area. Bees? Is there a connection to Dogora? Well, bees have instincts beyond our comprehension. We're getting a visual on radar number one. An altitude of 700. Doctor, what is that? You're late. It couldn't be helped. With all this madness, we were stopping constantly. Where is he? He's confined to the 4th floor, room 407. He hasn't left. - Brother. - Calm down. Look at that! Do you still insist he's confined to his room? But he answered every time I phoned him there. Get me room 407, please. Hello... Hello... You've come after all. There were three phone calls, but they hung up when I answered. Thanks. By the way, do you have the diamonds with you? Diamonds? No, no, I thought we were in agreement about what happened. Then why was the coal truck the only one attacked on the Highway? So? You knew those were fake. I see. Nice detective work. Who has those diamonds? You? You checked my baggage, didn't you? So why did you come all the way to Kyushu? Business. Business? I want you to stay out of my way. And if I don't? Judo, eh? I give up. Wait a minute! I want you to go out the way you came in. Dangerous! Look at that. Hello! Oh, it's you. I had to see someone. Was it Mark? He's staying on the 4th floor. Did you see him, sir? We met him on the train. By the way, maybe you can help me. - Monsters aren't my specialty. - Not about monsters. What is it, then? Bees. Bees? This is a special news bulletin. Dogora has just appeared in the skies of Dokaiwan Bay. All residents in northern Kyushu should seek immediate shelter. Doctor. There it is! - Open fire! - Open fire! It can't be stopped! Prepare to fire! Fire! We hit it! Doctor, did you see that? It's been silenced. Looks like we've found a way to fight it. So it appears. What's wrong with him? This isn't like him. Why can't he be as pleased as the rest of us? Something's wrong with the radar. What? Countless blips. Doctor! Just as I expected. Expected? The monster cell has started cell fission. - Cell fission? - Its numbers are multiplying. What's that? Take shelter! Take shelter! DOGORA ATTACKS O I L F I ELDS I N M I DDLE EAST DOGORA EATS ZARL M I NE DOGORA ATTACKS K I NG VALLEYM I NE WORLD UN I TES TO F I GHT DOGORA Iwasa, look at this! When Dogora was attacked, it turned into crystal. How did this monster turn into crystal? It has something to do with the bees. Bees? - Hello. - Hello. You must have had a hard time. Come, please. - Our trip was only half successful. - Half? There's an abandoned mine at one end of Chikuho Mine. The Kawata Mine. That's right. There's no passable road over there now. But the monster seems to have left a trail, but there were no beehives. - There weren't? - No. But there were wasp hives. Wasp hives? The whole mine was completely filled with wasp hives. No bees, but wasps. I see. Can you explain what's going on? A swarm of wasps attacked Dogora in retaliation for their destroyed hives. When stung, the toxin must have caused a chemical reaction. Perhaps we can use this as a weapon. I understand. We'll get to work on a toxin immediately. With Dr. Munakata's guidance, an analysis of the crystals was... ...successfully performed at the Medical Substance Laboratory. The crystals were found to be the result of... ...chemical reactions of wasp venom coming in contact with the space cells. The findings were sent to chemical plants... ...all over the world in order to maximize the manufacturing of wasp venom. Let's go back to Tokyo. We didn't come here for pleasure. The monster wants the diamonds, too. We're no match for that. You're free to leave at anytime. Keep cool. Mark's the one with the diamonds and he doesn't seem too worried. Mark's getting his bags together. All right. It's customary to knock before you open the door. I thought it was before entering. You're not coming through the window today, eh? Going somewhere? None of your business. - I'll go with you to find diamonds. - Good idea. - Where are the diamonds? - I haven't got any. Bastard! Enough of your tricks! You can't take that! Seikai Bank? I see. You're keeping them in a safe-deposit box, eh? Go get the diamonds! - Come, Sabu. - Okay. What are you going to do? Courtesy dictates we reward you for the diamonds you've given us. Diamonds for dynamite. Not bad, eh? What is it? The space monster, Dogora! Hurry up! All right. Everything's set. We just have to wait for the diamonds. You'll get a glimpse of the diamonds before you go to Hell. Do you think you can leave Japan? Don't worry. There'll be a boat waiting for us at Iwaba Seashore. But she won't be back. Cut the crap! Did you get the diamonds? - She got away. - What? She got away with the diamonds. I'm sorry about that. Damn it! Let's go! There's a gun in my suitcase. You got it, Komai! Come on. You can do it. A little closer... Fire! Look out! Come on, hurry up! The toxin tanks will arrive soon, sir. - How long will it take? - Twenty minutes, sir. Damn it! You're going to take them all for yourself, eh? You know what we do to double-crossers, don't you? Get up! Walk out to sea. Run! The police are coming! - Forget about the small fry. - Okay. Let's go that way. Okay. Let's go. Stop! Stay right where you are! Hey! Over there! Put your hands up! There's no escape! Hey Mark! Cover me! Damn! Hurry up! Hey, take aim at that bag. Get back. Look! - The toxin attack has begun! - All right! - K Corps! Open fire! - K Corps! Open fire! - Squadron 37, take off! - Squadron 37, take off! This way. What's that? - It's Dogora! - Get down! All right! Let's go! Run back! - Let's go! - Right! Lie down! Damn it! - Let's get across. - Right! Doctor! THE WORLD W I LL GET THROUGH CR I S I S DOGORA STAMPED OUT COMPLETELY I N THE NORTH POLE Oh, Komai! - Are you watching somebody? - No, I have something to ask you. Don't be shy. The diamonds were fake again. Right. There never were any real diamonds, were there? That was our plan all along. But nobody ever expected a diamond thief like Dogora. That definitely complicated things. If it's okay with you, I'd like to add your name to my official report. Doctor! Where are you going? To the U.N. to lecture on peaceful applications of our Dogora experience. Take care of yourself. I'll go with you, Doctor. Can I carry your bags? Don't you see, I'm still a young soldier. So long. Good luck! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. THE END
