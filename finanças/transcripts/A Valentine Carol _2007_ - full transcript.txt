[ Mid-tempo jazz music plays ] [ Door opens ] No. No yellow roses. When... no. When you get married on Valentine's day, you want red. So, what kind of wedding planner are you? You're telling me this two days before I get married. [ Sighs ] No, just hold on. Other line. [ Cellphone beeps ] I cannot talk, Gillian. I'm about to... wait. Are you crying? Ally? Forgot some papers at my apartment. I have to go pick them up. Don't forget... you're on the air with me at 10:00 sharp. Right. [ Sighs ] Gillian, if this is about what's-his-name, look, I just... Wait. Hold on. Wedding planner's on the other line. [ Cellphone beeps ] Look, I just find it really hard to believe that every florist in the city is sold out. There better be 200 red roses at my wedding... emphasis on red. Got it? [ Cellphone beeps ] Of course he cheated on you. You're a doormat. [ Water running ] Mom. Uh, no, da... No, dad didn't cheat on you. No, no. No. You're not a doormat. Mom, I-I thought... I thought you were Gillian. I-I got to go, okay? I'm sorry. [ Cellphone beeps ] [ Sighs ] [ Cellphone rings ] I can't talk. I'm one leg away from being entirely in the shower. Don't you want me to wash your back? Very funny. Listen, ally, I have a very important client flying in from Bangkok this morning. I don't have time to be on your show today. Well, this is just great. First, the wedding planner, then Gillian, and now you. Look, I'm sorry, but as a new partner, when the firm says, "jump," I have to say, "how high?" [ Chuckles ] All right. I'll see what I can do. [ Chuckles ] Just don't count on it, okay? Thanks. I'll make it up to you. [ Chuckles ] It's a good shot. [ Horns honk ] The wedding planner quit? He called me a what? [ Sighs ] Never mind. Just find me 200 red roses A.S.A.P. Gillian, are you crying again? Please. [ Cellphone beeps ] Good morning, ally. [ Elevator bell dings ] They can't move the photo shoot. It's been on the books for weeks. Don't they know that we're getting married in two days? Fine. I'll make it happen. [ Echoing ] Ally, listen to your heart. Weird. [ Both grunting ] God! Get off! Uh, uh, I'm so sorry. Uh, uh, um... oh, uh... Just... You okay? Well, let's see. If getting assaulted outside my office before I've had my morning coffee qualifies me as okay, then, yes, I'm okay. Thank you for your concern. Oh, it's Joe's Viagra. He has a hot date tonight with the new intern. Stop talking, Tim. Let me make something perfectly clear. Never say "Joe Biggs" and the word "Viagra" to me in the same sentence again, and never, ever, in the name of all that is holy, mention his dating life. Got it? [ Crying ] Gill, get me the overnight ratings and my call list. Can you tell I've been crying? Maybe a little. Coffee? No, thanks. No, I meant mine. Right. [ Slurps ] Mm. You didn't put sugar in this. Sorry. I barely slept last night. You stay at a motel? Not exactly. Please don't tell me you stayed at the apartment. We have a guest room. Oh, my god. They weren't still in the apartment, were they? Let me get this straight. You stayed in the next room while Derek was doing the mambo with Phoebe from the gap. It's not as bad as it sounds. I used ear plugs. Oh, my god! You know, if you weren't Jackie's niece, I'd have to fire you. Do you even listen to what I say on the show? Well, he's a musician. Women throw themselves at him. He's just confused right now. He's been confused for three years. I can't help it. I still love him. Please do not use the "l" word. I just can't throw away three years. I am not talking about throwing them away. I am talking about dousing them with kerosene and setting them on fire. Call him right now and end it. [ Dial tone ] I-I can't. I have mail to sort. Besides, you're on air in five. Wait. [ Sighs ] This is perfect. Ally, no. Please. Yes! Doing it on the air will make it final. It's exactly what you need. I don't think this is such a good idea. Hey, ladies. There gonna be some girl-on-girl action today? Joe, you're such a pig. [ Joe chuckles ] From the heart of Seattle, it's "lovespeak" with ally Simms. With Valentine's day just around the corner, some of you lonely listeners might be feeling a bit sorry for yourself. But being in a relationship isn't always the best solution. In the studio with me today is my assistant, Gillian, niece of the late, great Jackie Marley. Gillian, what's happened? Well [sighs] I... see... What's happened is Gillian came home last night and found her boyfriend rolling around in the sack with another woman. [ Canned jeering ] But today on the air, we're going to do something about it. We're gonna take back her power and set this loser straight. But before we do, let's answer a few simple questions. Gillian, what does this clown do for a living? He's a musician. Ladies, when are we gonna learn not to fall for musicians? And tell me, what kind of car does Elvis drive? '86 Ford Van. He needs it to carry his equipment. Does he live in it, too? And what about money? Does he make any? Well, the music business is unpredictable. I-It depends. Read between the lines, sister. Okay, Gillian, let's do it. [ Dial tone ] We're dialing. Are you ready? [ Speed-dialing ] [ Ringing ] Ally, I can't do this. Don't be afraid to take control of your life. It's ringing. Hello. Derek, uh, it's Gillian. Hey, sweet cheeks. What's up? Uh, actually, I... Well... I... Well... Derek, this is ally Simms from "lovespeak"... 96 kiss F.M. You're on the air, and Gillian has something very important she wants to tell you. [ Chuckling ] Wow. Hey, can I get one of those promotional t-shirts? [ Scoffs ] Tell him it's over and you want his crap out of the apartment before you get home tonight. Derek? Hi. Listen. When you get home from work tonight, if you wouldn't... Listen, you lying, cheating, guitar-playing scuzzbag, Gillian is through with you. After what you did last night, it's adlós, muchachos. Gather your things and crawl back to that hole you slithered out of. Gillian doesn't want to see you, hear you, or, god forbid, smell you ever again. Got it? Baby, i-is that how you feel? Because that other chick, she didn't mean anything. It's like she said. Dirt bag. [ Dial tone ] Wow, that felt great. Bravo. You did it. [ Voice breaking ] Actually, you're the one who... did it. Moral to the story is, if there's a loser in your life, get rid of him and don't look back. But, ally... Promise me, Gillian. I promise. Ladies and gentlemen, my assistant, former Valentine's sad sack, current single bad ass, Gillian. You go, girl! [ Cheers and applause ] ♪ Sweet love ♪ ♪ love is on my mind ♪ You're listening to "lovespeak" with ally Simms. What do you look for in a man? Let's take a look at Jackie Marley's five commandments of love. One... successful. That means money, and lots of it. Two... smart. But not a bore, unless bores turn you on. Three... good-looking. But take the cash over the looks any day, ladies. Four... ambitious. If he is in his 30s and asking people if they want fries with that, dump him, dump him, dump him. And five... a great car. Now, that is what I call a package. Well, girls, this is my favorite time in the show. Time to call my hunky fiancé, Matt. For those of you living under a rock, Matt is the firstborn son to the Dawson family and the youngest partner in the city's most prestigious law firm, Thorncliff, Shepherd, and Dawson. Oh, and don't tell anyone I told you, but there's a rumor circulating that he might run for congress soon. Oh, and I almost forgot. He drives a great car. Matt, are you there? Of course I'm here. This is our quality time. Being on your show's the only time I get to talk to you. He's joking. Okay, Matt, I have bad news and badder news. Great. What's the bad news? The wedding planner quit. You didn't call him "fat ass," did you? No, not today. Okay, what's the badder news? Seattle living has moved our wedding photo shoot to this afternoon at 4:00. What? I can't make it at 4:00. Besides, isn't it bad luck to see the bride in her wedding dress before the wedding? No, it's bad luck to turn down a six-page spread in a fine magazine like Seattle living. I know you will do your best to be there. I'll see you at 4:00. But wait a... [ dial tone ] Matt, can you hear me? Whoops, ladies. Looks like we lost him. Okay, time for one more caller. Jackie's on line two. Jackie, how can I help you? By learning what love really means. [ Keyboard clacking ] Come on. Ooh, aren't you a live one. [ Scoffs ] Not really, honey. Oh, did you get my flowers? They're Valentine red, not yellow. Who's this? Jackie Marley. What was up with that last caller? Which one? The creepy one who said she was Jackie Marley. Red, not yellow. Were you even listening? I was, but the last caller was nothing but dead air. These pranks aren't funny. She's dead. Why can't they just leave her alone? Can I go on my... Break? "Like I said, red, not yellow. See you tonight. J.M." I've met someone else, Derek. His name is George. George Clooney. And he loves me. [ Sighs ] Where did those flowers come from? What flowers? The ones in the middle of my desk. Are they from Matt? Let's hope not. They're dead. The wedding planner, maybe. I doubt he could find red roses, even dead ones. Besides, they're signed "j.M." And the card mentions yellow roses just like that last caller. [ Gasps ] Oh, my god. You've got a lesbian stalker. Great. I'll be in my office watching "Ellen." Is it okay if I take my... Break? What are you doing? Oh! Oh! Hi, ally. You scared me. What were you just taking out of Gillian's pocket? Oh, no. No, god, no. I was putting something in. Like what? It's kind of private. Kind of private? Is that like kind of fired? No, no, no. It's not what you think. Ever since the first day I met Gillian, well, it was love at first sight. You understand. And now that she's officially single, I decided to write her a haiku to tell her how I feel. A haiku? Yeah, you talked about it last month on your show. You said it's never too late to communicate. - I did? - You did. And if it's not too much trouble, I thought maybe you could put in a good word for me. Look, Tim, I give love advice on the air, okay? I'm not a dating service. Oh, hey, Tim. I wanted to thank you for organizing the CD archives. No problem. I love to organize. You should see my closet. Okay. It's got hangers... And shelves. Wow. You look beautiful. Blame it all on Lisa. It's amazing what you can do with a good brush and some superglue. Gillian, if you start crying about Derek again, I'm gonna have to hurt you. No, I... I'm just so happy for you. Thanks. [ Chuckles ] It is pretty great. The cover of Seattle living is a very big deal. I meant your wedding. Oh. You must hate that Matt's not here. Yeah, it's a real shame. Is this not the most beautiful dress you've ever seen? Oh, did you get my pearls? It's a haiku. I love haiku. "You make my heart float. The sweetness that is your eyes, I long from afar." He's trying to get me back. - Who? - Derek. Maybe he's changed. Y-You really think Derek wrote that? Oh, you've never seen this side of him. The man has no sides. He was cheating on you 24 hours ago. God, be happy he's out of your life. Don't you get it? It's exactly like you say on the show. "It takes something really dramatic to change a person." Well, breaking up on the radio was dramatic. Derek couldn't have written that, okay? The man can barely speak in complete sentences, and last time I checked, hasn't mastered cursive writing. Well, if Derek didn't write it, who did? Okay, it was Tim. Tim who? - Office Tim. - Office Tim? Office Tim... haiku Tim. Forget about Tim, okay? You can do so much better than that bumbling idiot. He's a P.A., for god's sakes. And, remember, only losers date losers. [ Sighs ] Tell you what. How about if I just set you up with someone at the wedding? - Promise? - I promise. W-Who are you thinking of? I don't know. Maybe one of Matt's friends. Really? Like Dave, maybe? [ Sighs ] It'll be a surprise. Trust me. ♪ Love, want love it's what I'm thinkin' of ♪ ♪ playin' undercover in the sweet September rain ♪ ♪ sweet September rain ♪ ♪ 'cause I want love ♪ ♪ can't stop, can't get enough ♪ ♪ think about the love and I forget about the pain ♪ ♪ the painful love ♪ ♪ before I lose my mind ♪ ♪ because I want love ♪ ♪ a love I got to find ♪ ♪ I need love ♪ ♪ in the Nick of time ♪ [ Cellphone ringing, buzzing ] Oh, my god. [ Ringing, buzzing continue ] "Dinner at 8:00." Ally, you were supposed to meet Matt for dinner an hour ago. Well, why didn't you remind me? Call Matt right now and tell him that I'm running late, and then help me get out of this dress. [ Indistinct conversations ] Sorry. Gillian screwed up, and the photo shoot ran long. She was supposed to remind me to call you. You need a reminder to call me? You know what I mean. No, ally, I don't. Look, I understand you're under a lot of pressure with the show and the wedding, but, really, I have been sitting here for more than an hour. Well, this wouldn't have happened if you'd been at the shoot. Look, I can't help it if they change the schedule at the last minute. I just couldn't make it tonight. But you didn't even try. Of course I did. Well, then you didn't try hard enough. I can't believe you just said that. [ Sighs ] Guess what I got today. Another pair of Manolo Blahniks? Funny, no. Dead roses. Dead roses? Yeah. Must've given somebody pretty lousy advice. Ally Simms? That's me. Sorry to bother you, but we're both giant fans of your show. Oh. We just wanted to congratulate you on your wedding. And I wanted to thank you for helping me end my relationship with Brad. [ Sighs ] Do you think we could get your autograph? Absolutely. What did you say your name was? Um, I'm Zoey. Look, uh, I'm gonna take off. I've got a conference call with London, and I still have to prep the financials. I'll catch up with you later. I thought we were gonna have dinner. Uh, well, that was an hour and a half ago. Besides, who needs the calories? See you later. Can you write something about love? That's my area of expertise. [ Pen scratching ] [ Clock ticking ] [ Keys jingle ] [ Liquid pours, glasses clink ] [ Liquid pouring ] [ Floorboard creaks ] Ally, darling, is that you? [ Door hinges creak ] Hey, I hope you like those flowers I sent you. [ Gasps ] [ Laughs ] Hey, kiddo. Long time, no see, huh? [ Screams ] Oh, ally, please. Show a little decorum. [ Screaming ] Cheers. [ Chuckles ] [ Screaming ] [ Gasps ] Oh, my god. That's not possible. Ooh! [ Chuckles ] I-It can't be you. You're... y-y-y-y-you're... Dead? Uh-huh. Oh, relax. I'm not gonna hurt you. Stay put. Still take it dry with two olives? [ Gasps ] Oh, my god. Oh, my god. What's happening to me? [ Liquid pouring ] This is just a dream. Please, god, just tell me this is a dream. Eh, you can forget about talking to the head honcho on this one, honey. He's the reason I'm here. He sent me. Down it. Attagirl. Feel better? No. [ Sighs ] This isn't real. This isn't real. Let me make this as easy as I can. Scoot over. [ Gasps ] Look, you already know I'm dead, right? That's not the worst of it. I'm stranded outside those proverbial pearly gates with no key. I'm stuck in heaven's parking lot. And since breaking and entering isn't exactly an option, I'm down here on a mission to earn my key. How you gonna do that? By completely changing your life. What's wrong with my life? Ha! Come on. You're making the same mistakes I did. You don't know what love is. The way you're going, you're gonna end up just like I did. Bitter, drunk, and all alone? It's a little more complicated than that. [ Slurping ] Mm. Oh, god, that's good. [ Belches ] I'm starving. [ Chuckles ] You got something to eat? Oh, god, I missed food. [ Chuckles, moans ] Oh, I spent way too much of my life on a diet. Mmm. [ Chuckles ] Look. It's amazing how decomposing takes the pounds right off. [ Sighs ] I am not gonna end up like you. I'm not. I'm marrying the perfect man in two days. The truth is, if you marry Matt on Valentine's day, it's gonna be the biggest mistake of your life. I see that being dead hasn't made you any less of a know-it-all. I don't have a clue. Neither do you. Yeah, well, my, uh, listeners would disagree. Since I took over for you, my audience has doubled. Not a good idea to piss off a dead person. Listen up, sister. Love is the most important thing we have. You can't even say the word. [ Scoffs ] That's not true. You call it the "l" word. When's the last time you told Matt you loved him? Fine. You made your point. I'll be a better person tomorrow. Can I go to bed now? Not yet. [ Whimpering ] Don't worry. I got your stuff. [ Laughs ] Whoo! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! What are you doing? We need a certain amount of vertical drop to get started. Standard procedure. I don't want to die! Are you crazy?! I don't want to die! Trust me. You're gonna learn your lesson, and I'm gonna get my key. So... next stop, a Valentine past. Buckle your seat belt, sister. It's gonna be a bumpy ride. [ Both scream ] Oh, my god! Whew! Oh, my god! Did you kill me? Oh, stop being a drama queen. Oh, my god. This... this was my... Mm-hmm. Valentine's past seven years ago, where you and Ben used to live. [ Gasps ] I loved this place. All you did was complain about it. The taps had brown water. The heat didn't work. Ben! [ Gasps ] Look! What are you doing? [ Chuckles ] It's Ben. Mm-hmm. And me. Okay. [ Gasps ] Oh! Oh, my... mm. Mm, Ben, it's the most beautiful Valentine's ever. Wait. Come on. Come on. You can get closer. They can't see us or hear us. Oh, my god. Smells delicious. Yes, the coq au vin turned out pretty well if I do say so myself. He was such a great kisser. Is that all he was to you? No. I cared about him a lot. You loved him. See? There's that whole "l" -word thing happening again. The boy made your heart skip a beat. [ Sighs ] Oh! Almost forgot the special ingredient. [ Sighs ] [ Gasps ] Oh! Oh, no. Mm-hmm. The ring. Open it. Okay. It's beautiful. It was my grandmother's. I look so happy. That's because you are happy, nimwit. Ally Simms... Will you marry me? Seemed so perfect for each other. Things changed. Yeah, in a heartbeat. [ Telephone rings ] [ Laughs ] Oh. Oh, talk about bad timing. [ Laughs ] [ Answering machine clicks ] It's Ben and ally. Leave a message. [ Answering machine beeps] This is Jackie Marley calling for ally Simms. Congratulations. Starting next Monday, you're my new assistant. See you in Seattle. And don't be late. [ Gasps ] Oh, my god! This is... this is like a... This is amazing! This is like a dream come true! Congratulations, baby. It's an opportunity of a lifetime. Does this mean you'll be moving to Seattle? Well, yeah, but it... We can go back and forth on the weekends until you finish at the culinary academy. Okay. Okay. [ Chuckles ] All right. [ Sighs ] Let's try this again. Ally Simms, 96 kiss F.M.'S newest employee, will you marry me? Yes. [ Sniffles ] Oh! I really should call Jackie back. I just... I don't want her to think I didn't get the message. [ Dialing ] If you listen closely, you can actually hear Ben's heart break. We only lasted a few more months. Hi. It's ally Simms for Jackie Marley. Yeah, I'll hold. This is so sad. Buck up. We're just getting started. Whoa! Whoa! Oh, sorry about the landing. Come here. Still getting used to this whole being-dead thing. Why are we here? Valentine's day three years ago. Not my favorite day, but some things can't be helped. [ Sighs ] I loved that skirt. Oh, yeah. Cute. What happened to it? - Got a little pilly. - Mm. But we've talking about me co-hosting for over a year. Don't you think it's time? I just don't think you're ready. I am ready. And besides, I'm older than you when you started. It's not as easy as it looks. [ Cracks ] God, my jaw hurts. Look, people tune in to hear point of view. I got to be strong and bitchy and willing to mix it up to get on the air. I don't think you want it enough. I do. More than anything. [ Knock on door ] Don't you spend enough time in the studio, Jackie? [ Both laugh ] I've got some people out here that are just dying to hear from you. Oh, there she is. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. - Congratulations. Ladies and gentlemen, the mistress of the microphone and our favorite Valentine... [ Giggles ] ...I give you, Jackie Marley. [ Applause ] 25 years in radio. Oh, well, gee, I'm not sure I can do this without a microphone in front of me. [ Laughter ] Well, first of all, I'd just like to say thank you to the little people who I stepped on to get where I am today. [ Laughter ] No. Um, seriously, I, um... I'm very grateful... [ Chokes ] No, I... I am very grateful... [ Stammers ] God, I hate this part. Mm. [ Stammering, whimpering ] - Oh, my god! - Oh, my god! - No, Jackie! - Oh, no! Please help! Somebody call 911. - Oh, god. - Oh, is she... Is... is there a doctor? Give her some room. I think this woman's had a heart attack. We need to get her to a hospital. Do you know what you're doing? I should hope so. I'm a brain surgeon. Is she gonna be all right? That depends on her heart. Tell me something I don't know. [ P.A. system dings ] Dr. Carson to O.R. three. O.R. three, please, Dr. Carson. They have excellent doctors at this hospital. She's in good hands. Thanks. Really. Uh, I don't understand. Why were you even there tonight? Serendipity. I'm an old friend of Donna's, and... - Who's Donna? - Shh! ...a sucker for what sounded like a good party. Mm. Do you want to grab a cup of coffee? I know a little place. Yeah. Sounds just like the thing. Good. Please. While I'm lying in E.C.U. With tubes running out of me, you're going on a date? Sorry. He was just trying to comfort me. And besides, I couldn't help it if he had bedroom eyes and a surgeon's hands. Ugh. [ Elevator bell dings ] Whatever. [ Church bell tolls ] I learned everything I know from Jackie Marley. She was a self-centered, bitchy know-it-all, but I'm really gonna miss her. I even feel bad for calling her "the mouth" behind her back. Hey! What? I said I missed you. [ Sighs ] It's cold. - Just so nervous. - No, you'll do fine. Now, this is the moment you've been fighting for. You've watched Jackie do the show a million times. Now, just take a... Take a deep breath. [ Inhales deeply ] [ Sighs ] I just really want them to love me, that's all. Oh, they'll love you just like they loved Jackie, okay? Now, do you know what the staff's nickname for you is? Jackie junior. - Really? - Yeah, really. Now, you knock 'em dead today, and... and the show is yours. - Really? - Yeah. You know, I have a feeling that Jackie is in the clouds right now, watching over you. Clouds, my ass. That was the start of my career. And the end of innocence. Hello, Seattle. This is ally Simms behind the Mike where the late, great Jackie Marley once sat. We're all going to miss you, Jackie. Thank you for the lovely dinner. It was amazing. Why is it every time I get you into an elevator, I just want to take advantage of you? [ Chuckles ] Maybe it's the up-and-down motion. [ Both chuckle ] What is it with you two and elevators? What can I say? The guy had a thing for elevators. And he really knew his way around the female anatomy. [ Scoffs ] Happy Valentine's day. You have my heart. Do I have yours? I think you're definitely in the right area. [ Chuckles ] ♪ can't get enough ♪ ♪ think about the lovin' and forget about the pain ♪ - Ally. - Whew. [ Elevator bell dings ] Mm. Do you believe in the magic of the supernatural? [ Giggles ] What are you talking about? It's Valentine's day. Exactly one year since we met. I think cupid may have paid us a visit. Maybe you should look under your pillow. [ Gasps ] [ Squeals ] It's... it's so big! [ Chuckles ] Oh! I know it's only been a year, but when my heart speaks to me, I try to listen. Will you marry me, ally? [ Sighs ] Okay, that would be you going through my five commandments of love. Successful... check. Smart... check. Good-looking... check. Ambitious... check. Mercedes coupe. Double check. Double check. Yes. Yes, I'll marry you. [ Chuckling ] Ah, I'm so happy. Ohh. Looking into your eyes, I know my life has a special purpose. - It does? - Yes. And finding my soul mate gives me the strength to do what I've always wanted to do. It does? Yes, it does. I'm gonna resign from the hospital. What? Hear me out. Since I've met you, my lifestyle's lost its meaning. Money, fast cars, success... It's all empty. Our love is all that I need. Now I want to go where I can give something back. I want to move to Ethiopia. - Ethiopia? - It'll be perfect. We can honeymoon on safari for a week before I start my job at the refugee camp. How'd we go from elevators to Ethiopia? - What? - Nothing. Look, don't worry about this. I've already made arrangements with the consulate. It's all set. Paul, you're a great guy. And it's not that I don't admire what you're doing. It's just, I have my on radio show now. I don't care about poor people anymore. But, ally, think about the children. Maybe this makes me shallow, but you can't ask a girl to marry you and then after she says yes, tell her you want to move to some third-world country. It just doesn't work that way, Paul. [ Ring clinks ] [ Sighs ] Can we go now? I don't think I can bear to watch what happens next. Does he cry? Like the Mississippi. Aw. [ Paul crying ] You still think about him, don't you? Some nights, you even wonder what life would've been like. He had passion. Mm-hmm. But I was building a career. And, I mean, come on. Ethiopia? It's not about Ethiopia or Seattle or the moon. It's about love, ally. Ben and Paul had two things in common. They both loved you, and they both made your heart skip a beat. You were crazy about them. Well, I'm crazy about Matt, too. Oh, which reminds me, there's one last Valentine's day you need to look at... Your first date with Matt. Ohh. [ Paul sobbing ] Oh, god! Oh, that poor man. [ Mid-tempos music playing ] Mm. Do you remember this place? Yeah. There you go. Thank you. I'll be back to take your orders. You good? Yeah, thank you. This place is amazing. I can't believe I've never been here before. Yeah, this is my home away from home. God, these guys are so lucky. They actually get to play music for a living. [ Chuckling ] Right. Late hours and lousy money? I'd take a man with a job like yours any day. Really? Mm-hmm. Because, uh, just between you and me, I actually play a pretty mean piano. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah, but it's not like it's your job. I mean, you're the youngest partner in the city's most prestigious law firm. [ Southern accent ] I mean, why, sir, you're just a girl's dream come true. [ Both laugh ] [ Clears throat ] You know, I have to admit, I've never actually been out with a celebrity before. [ Normal voice ] Oh, it's just a local talk show. Your face is all over bus stops. That's enough for me. [ Both chuckle ] Well, I hate that stupid picture. - Really? - Mm-hmm. I think it's kind of cute. Although, I do have to say, you are much prettier in person. [ Chuckles ] See? I told you we were perfect for each other. Let me ask you something. Just when exactly did you decide you're gonna become Mrs. Big shot lawyer? As soon as I met him. Is it my fault I appreciate a smart, ambitious, good-looking man? Oh, ally, you just fell for the package, girl. You skipped over that, you know, the whole "getting to know him" part. Well, I knew he just made partner. Mm. I knew he earned six figures. Mm. He picked me up in a Porsche, and he turned the head of every girl in the club. But what did you know about the guy? Did you ask any of the important questions? Does he want kids? Is he religious? Coke or Pepsi? Boxers or briefs? Briefs. Don't be a smart ass. You know what I mean. Look at him. What's Matt really about? What's his passion? Do you even know the guy you're about to marry in two days? Hmm? Boxers. Mm. Briefs. Boxers. Boxers. [ Alarm clock clicks ] Is it my fault that chicks crave a cup of Joe in the morning? I give them a... [ Sighs ] Why me? [ Mid-tempo jazz music playing ] [ Doorbell rings ] Coming. [ Door opens ] Matt, it's me. Are you decent? No, but come on in. Hey. Hi. Aww, what a nice surprise. I, um, thought since we had missed dinner last night, we could share some breakfast. Great. Uh, are we okay? What do you mean? Well, you know, the whole photo-shoot fiasco and then dinner getting ruined. Forget about it. It's no big deal. Come on. I got a 9:00, but we can talk while I get dressed. I've got the editor from Seattle living in the studio this morning. Guess that means you're off the hook today. Do I know the real you, Matt? Let's hope so. You're marrying me. And I know all the really important things about you, right? Let me see. I hate fruit in salads. I like to sleep with the window open. I like Letterman, not Leno. That should get you up to speed. Are you having any second thoughts? About what? The wedding. Is my confident, take-charge bride-to-be getting cold feet? No. I just... [ Sighs ] ...want to make sure that you are okay. Just want us to be happy. I am happy. I'm happy because I'm marrying you. Oh, geez. Look at the time. I'm already late. I'll see you at the rehearsal dinner. Have a good one, ally. Ally! Hey, ally! [ Elevator bell dings ] [ Sighs ] [ Grunts ] Good morning. Thanks for holding it. Hi, ally. Tim. It's Joe's. What did we talk about yesterday? Oh, don't worry. It's not... It has nothing to do with little Joe at all. Sorry. So... did Gillian get my note? Here's the thing, Tim. If you're gonna write a girl a love note, be sure to sign it. She thinks her boyfriend wrote it. I thought you were gonna help me. I was at a photo shoot. I didn't have a chance to slip into my cupid outfit. Don't go in there. Why? What's wrong? There's someone waiting for you in your office. Who? He made me promise not to tell. Who do you work for again? It's an old boyfriend. Ben? Wow. Hi... what a surprise. [ Both chuckle ] Ooh. God, you look amazing. You look pretty fantastic yourself. Guess the move to Seattle worked out pretty well after all. "Lovespeak" with ally Simms. I'm really happy for you. Thanks. What about you? What brings you to Seattle? I live here. Finally made the move about two years ago. I was gonna call you, but, uh... I guess I was busy licking my wounds. Well... culinary school seems to be treating you well. You still cooking? Actually, I’m, uh, more of a supervisor now. I own the Ivy. - You own the Ivy? - Yeah. - The Ivy on third? - That's the one. Wow. Yeah, and I just bought the Pearl. You should call me. We should have dinner some night. I'd love to. I saw your wedding announcement in the paper. Valentine's day. Made me remember when that used to be our day. Oh, hey, congratulations. Your fiancé's a very lucky guy. No, I'm the lucky one. That is, uh, quite the rock he gave you. Sort of puts my grandmother's ring to shame. I loved that ring. Beautiful. So [clears throat] Do you have time for coffee? I thought you'd be married. I was, but I'm divorced now. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, you should be. It's all your fault. - Me? - No, I'm kidding. It's a funny story, actually. My wife phoned your show once for advice. Oh, my god. Yeah, and, uh, guess what you told her. [ Chuckling ] I don't think I want to know. "Dump him, dump him, dump him." Ouch. Sorry. Oh, it's okay. I mean, you were right. By then, we were, uh, just going through the motions. Ally, I got to be honest with you. It wasn't just coincidence me showing up today. I saw your wedding announcement in the newspaper, and... Well, I kind of felt like I had been sucker-punched. What do you mean? Well, truth is, I've never let go of you. And believe me... I've tried. Ben, this is crazy. I'm getting married tomorrow. [ Sighs ] You're not married yet. Ally, I didn't know what to expect when I came to see you this morning, but there's something in your eyes that tells me I made the right decision. I think you might still have some feelings for me. Um... I-I, uh, have to go. I'm sorry. Um, I just, uh, have to get back to the station. I-I know my timing is bad, but will you at least think about it? [ Knock on door ] Go away, Gillian. I'm not doing another show. Let them run a repeat. Not Gillian. It's me... your favorite ghost. Ugh. No. Not you. I was just hoping you were a horrible, horrible dream. Now, is that any way to greet an old friend? [ Scoffs ] I really do see dead people. Not dead people. Just me. Oh, stop being a drama queen. We have business to take care of. So? Any epiphanies since we last met? - Ben was here. - Really? Well, aren't you popular? Just showed up completely out of the blue. Mm. Did you have anything to do with that? Not really. All right, well, I may have flipped the newspaper he was reading to the wedding announcements. But, hey, so what? He came here of his own free will. He looked amazing. Really? So, what'd he say? That he still has feelings for me. Really? And what'd you say? Didn't know what to say. Told him I was late for a meeting. Attagirl. Way to avoid dealing with any real feelings. Well, what was I supposed to say? It all happened so fast. You know, if you were sure about your feelings for Matt, you would've told him so. You think maybe you still love Ben? I don't know. It was a long time ago, and... And I... [ Sighs ] It's just all so confusing. And for the record, your heart went absolutely bonkers when you saw him. [ Giggles ] Why is this happening to me? I told you, sister, you got something to learn. So come on. We got places to go and people to see. [ Groans ] [ Operatic music playing ] - [ Grunts ] - Whoo! Where are we? Ew, uh, oops. Wrong address. What's Derek doing back inside Gillian's apartment building? He was invited. We are officially at Valentine present. It's tomorrow night... Just after your wedding. He's moving back in? Yep. I'm afraid so. But why? [ Sighs ] Well, without getting too technical with the science, for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. [ Sighs ] I have no idea what you're talking about. All right, here's how it goes. You forced Gillian to break up with Derek. Then you refused to help office Tim, even badmouthing him to her. And then you promised to set her up at your wedding, but you didn't. All of which left her alone and vulnerable on Valentine's day. Hey, sweet cheeks. Ooh, you look good. You got anything to eat in here? I'm starving. [ Mid-tempo music playing ] I'd kill for a highball right now. I've been told no more drinking on the job. [ Sighs ] I love this song. Yep. It's great. But why are we here? Check out the piano player. - Matt? - Mm-hmm. This is what he loves more than anything else in the world. He's here on Valentine's day? No. He's here tonight. He's gonna duck out of your rehearsal dinner early so he can come back here and play for the last time. "For the last time"? I-I... I don't understand. Why didn't he tell me? Shh! Why didn't he tell me the truth? Shh! This is the best part. [ Up-tempo piano music plays ] [ Applause ] Bravo! Bravissimo! [ Chuckles ] The guy's got talent. He does. He really does. Ooh. I think I just heard your heart skip a beat. [ Applause ] What? Never seen him so happy. Oh. Why did he keep this a secret? Don't kid yourself. He's heard your show. I'm buying, man. What you drinking, maestro? Double Jack on the rocks. - Sure. - Make that two. You got it. [ Sighs ] Matty, say it ain't so, man. This band just ain't gonna be the same without you tickling those ivories, bro. I just can't keep it a secret anymore. You ask me, you should quit that firm, not the band. Yeah, I'd love to. But ally's got certain... Expectations. Playing music for a living isn't one of them. [ Scoffs ] I-I don't know, man. I've known for like, what, 10 years now? You're a musician, B. You can't quit. It's in your blood. Look, if ally loves you, she got to love the music, too. You understand what I'm saying? To the music. No. To love. See what I mean? What am I gonna do? Drink heavily. [ Knock on door ] Please leave me alone. I can't take any more valentines. No valentines, just Seattle living. [ Sighs ] Hey, Gillian, come on in. Sorry to disturb, but... But, uh, thought you might want to see the proofs from the photo shoot. Seattle living wants you to sign off on the ones you like A.S.A.P. And I've found a florist who can get the roses for the wedding, but she won't be cheap. There's something missing from these pictures. The groom? Yeah. Maybe they can Photoshop Matt into the pictures. I could ask. Ooh, I forgot. This came for you. Oh, dear. "Ally, this note is probably as big a surprise to you as your wedding announcement was to me. Meet me at the place across from the thing. Hopefully, Paul." Ally, are you okay? You look like you just saw a ghost. Nope. This one's real. I'm taking the rest of the day off. But, ally, what am I supposed to tell Seattle living? [ Door slams ] ♪ Seasons pass, rivers flow ♪ ♪ and I accept the things I cannot control ♪ One latte... no foam. And if I remember correctly, you always loved baklava. Thanks. I can't believe you just got back to Seattle yesterday. 18 hours on a plane. But thankfully, I'm here now. You certainly are. So, how was Ethiopia? Amazing. Really. But a lot has changed since that starry-eyed idealist last saw you. Then again, nothing's changed. So what, um, brings you back to Seattle aside from the salmon and the space needle? Kismet. Fate. Providence. I was on my way to Honolulu for a medical conference when my flight ran into some sort of mechanical difficulty, so they set down in Seattle. I had the strangest feeling that someone was leading me back to you. Suddenly, it was crystal clear. I knew I had to see you. It's really good to see you, too. So, um, are you still toiling away in Ethiopia? Not exactly. Um... you see, after my first year in Africa, the world health organization tapped me to act as a medical liaison with the government. One thing led to another, and recently, I was appointed director general. Director general? Yeah. I was reassigned to Paris. I live in a 17th-century mansion in the Marais. The view of the Eiffel Tower from the master suite is stunning. You'd love it. I don't know. I have a pretty good view of the space needle from my back bathroom. [ Chuckles ] Ally, my life has evolved in ways I never thought possible. But through it all, there was always one thing missing... you. Wow. I've had a lot of time to think about what I left back in Seattle, and I've never gotten over you, even after all these years. I've come to realize that you are the love of my life. [ Chokes, spits ] Paul... Listen, when I get back from Hawaii, I'd just like us to spend a few weeks together before I return to Paris. That'd just give us some time to get to know each other again. Paul, i-i-I'm so sorry, but I... I'm getting married. Tomorrow. Ally, I believe that I was sent here for a reason. You see, I've learned to trust life's little twists of fate. I know this sounds shocking. I can hardly believe it myself. But what I feel is real. If you have a change of heart. Ally Simms, I believe in you. [ Indistinct conversations ] Excuse me. [ Glass dinging ] I would officially like to welcome ally into our family. You know, I, uh... I heard ally before I actually met her. In fact, I heard her a lot. [ Laughter ] It's good to know, regarding affairs of the heart, that my son is in the hands of a professional. To the most beautiful couple in all of Seattle. Cheers. Yeah, congratulations. - They're so cute. - To Matt and ally. - To Matt and ally. - To Matt and ally. Good luck. - Cheers. - Cheers. To Matt and ally. To Matt and ally. [ Thunder crashes ] All right, all right. I only had one. [ Clears throat ] [ Clinks glass ] Attention, everybody. Attention just for a minute, please. I just want to thank everyone for coming tonight. It means a lot to ally and me to spend this special time with family and friends. Now, being the workaholic that I am, I do have some work to attend to this evening. [ Guests groan ] I know, I know. But don't go anywhere. The bar's still open for everyone except for Dez. [ Laughter ] And my beautiful wife-to-be will continue to charm and entertain you. Tomorrow's a big, big day. Oh! [ Applause ] Do you really have to go? I just want to make sure that everything's taken care of before the honeymoon. No, but stay. It's our rehearsal dinner, and... and besides, you haven't even heard my grandma tell her story about the time she was on my show. It's... it's hilarious, really. Well, I can hear it after we're married. But I-I know, but I was just really hoping that maybe you could just... Sweetie, don't worry about it. We're gonna have a whole lifetime to hang out together. Ally, I got to go. Matty. See you two lovebirds tomorrow, all right? - Night, Dez. - Night. Okay, I got to run. Just think... next time I see you, you're gonna be my bride. I got to go. Okay. - Good night. - Bye. [ Sighs ] [ Wind gusts ] [ Gasps ] Don't do that! You scared the living bejesus out of me! Don't blame me. You're the one sitting around in the dark. Ooh, how very spooky. Well, now that you're here, what do you want aside from the free booze? I just happened to notice that you didn't exactly body slam Matt tonight to prevent him from going to the club. What was I supposed to do? Maybe it's for the best. You know, everybody's got to make sacrifices in relationships. Except you, of course. Haven't I taught you anything? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know! [ Sighs ] Put your shoes on, sister. We're going to Valentine days yet to come. We're going back to the future. [ Groans ] Vámonos! [ Door hinges creak ] Welcome to Valentine's day future... Seven years after your wedding day. [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Dog barks ] Good god almighty. Forget it. Not even the supreme being would touch this one. [ Baby crying ] Derek, I didn't make these kids on my own. I have to get to work. I need your help. Maxwell needs her diaper changed. Baby, I can't. I'm in the middle of a new lyric. Just give me a sec. You've been working on that lyric for six months. ♪ My love is like a... ♪ [ Mumbling ] Gillian, I begged you to break up with him. Ooh. Look what you made me do, Derek! God, this is a mess! ♪ My love is like a... ♪ She doesn't work at the radio station anymore? You fired her because she took too much time off to take care of her kids. [ Banging ] I've got to go. I'm late for work. [ Knock on wall ] Keep it down over there! You're the one making all the racket! [ Shouting indistinctly ] [ Scoffs ] Will you excuse me just a sec? [ Crashing, cat yowls, man screams ] Whew! [ Sighs ] There. Like I was saying, the poor thing supports the entire family working as a supermarket cashier. Oh, by the way, thanks for the Valentine's day flowers, honey. What flowers? Who sent you flowers? No one. [ Crying continues ] [ Door opens, slams ] [ Dialing ] Hey, sugar. She's gone. [ Chuckles ] 15 minutes? [ Chuckles ] Oh, yeah. [ Barks ] Let's get out of here before it gets really ugly. ♪ My love is like a roller... ♪ Hurry! Oh, they're already on the air. Who's on the air? What does this have to do with me, anyway? Everything. It's papa Joe and his little bro... - Oh, no. - ...On the radio. [ Guitar riff plays ] So get ready, ladies, because next Monday, we are gonna rock 'n' roll with 96 kiss F.M.'S first annual Booty bongo. This is impossible. He's like a Joe Biggs clone. Frick and frack. Joe and I will be taking applications in person tonight down at the kiss F.M. Studios. So put your itsy-bitsy bikinis on, babies, and don't be late. God, I hate this show. My buddy Tim has devoted his life to big-time B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Booty! He is a true, blue disciple of the Biggs philosophy. Boo-yeah! Congratulations. You get credit for this one. Office Tim wasn't good enough, remember? Wasn't up to your standard? That sweet soul who wrote Gillian that haiku doesn't exist anymore. Fine. I get it. He's a jerk, and it's my fault. Can we go now? And don't forget, on Friday, Joe and I are gonna be down at the candy bar to judge their annual wet t-shirt contest. Boo-yeah! Now, remember, girls... [ Snorts ] Well, it just makes me laugh. Let's see that crack in your rack. ♪ Jug city ♪ ♪ jug, jug city ♪ Just think... you could've saved the world from that guy. You made your point. I should've helped Tim with that stupid haiku. Happy? It's not about helping him with the haiku. It's about how you view the world. It's about you. Me? Yes. Life is not a radio show. You got to stop listening to your own advice, honey. You took one look at Tim, and you decided that you knew who he was. Just like you did with Matt. You can't judge a man with a checklist, ally. And you certainly can't marry one that way. [ Tinkles ] [ Elevator bell dings ] [ Sighs ] Ooh, pretty juicy. "Love guru and Dawson heir split"? Mm-hmm. Told you it was juicy. I don't understand. Why did Matt and I get a divorce? Because you got married for all the wrong reasons. [ Sighs ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Okay, here he comes. - Okay. - Okay, here we go. Is this about our divorce? [ Sighs ] Yes. Ally, it's all about you. Well, I was just asking. Mr. Dawson, do you feel you were given a fair trial? What do you think of the verdict? Verdict? W-What happened? Did he kill me? No! But he probably should've. In your divorce settlement, you took him for the house, the cars, the bank accounts... Even the shih tzu. Shih tzu? [ Indistinct shouting ] Are you happy with your legal team? Do you still love Allison? Are you going to appeal? Are you guilty as charged? I'm afraid I've lost my moral compass. Maybe it was stolen from me. I'm not sure anymore. Excuse me. This is the end of a dark episode in the history of one of Seattle's pre-eminent families. Today, Matt Dawson was convicted on S.E.C. Violations and corporate fraud. He was sentenced to 22 years in a federal prison. 22 years?! [ Sighs ] Don't worry, honey. His sentence gets reduced for good behavior. He's only gonna serve eight years. Dawson's life began to spiral out of control when he and wife radio host ally Simms split in a bitter divorce. In this case, the vagaries of love led Dawson out of the penthouse and into the big house. This is Joey Calhoun reporting live outside the courtroom. Back to you, Susan. That's her. Let's go. Let's see what she's got to say about it. - Ms. Simms! - Ms. Simms! Ms. Simms, do you have any comment on your ex-husband's conviction? [ Camera shutters clicking ] [ Voice breaking ] He told me if I took him for everything, that he would be financially ruined and would have to go on a crime spree. I thought he was kidding. And the Oscar goes to... What a bitch. [ Both squeal ] [ Panting ] If this were the present, I'd sue. [ Groans ] What idiot mopped these floors? They're soaking wet. [ Whistling ] Somebody ought to fire that guy. Hm. They will. The irony is, when you were married, you always complained he never cleaned up after himself. [ Chuckles ] Matt? Mm-hmm. [ Sighs ] I don't understand. He used to work here. His family owns this building. His family cut him loose when he was convicted. So when Matt got out of prison, this was the only job he could find. His old partners felt sorry for him. The only thing he cares about is music, and the years he wasted not doing what he loved. This is terrible. I feel so wicked. Well, that's a step in the right direction. But don't worry. He won't be here for long. - He won't? - No. He'll be fired for showing up drunk one too many times. By Christmas, he'll be out of a job. By Valentine's day... Ckkk! He'll be homeless. [ Door opens ] Wha... what are we doing back at Matt's place? This is your place now. Another perk of the divorce settlement. It's where you bring all your boys du jour. Well, what's that supposed to mean? You sexual conquests. [ Clicks tongue ] Some of them were barely legal. Well, how old am I? Getting up there. Mid-50s. But you look fabulous, darling. Husband number three was a plastic surgeon. [ Footsteps approaching ] [ Gasps ] Oh, my god! I'm off the bra chart. [ Chuckling ] Honey, you've been pinched, prodded, and pumped to within an inch of your life. But you'd be happy to know that all of your husbands were loaded, had tons of ambition, looked good in a suit, drove great cars. Sound familiar? I'm so shallow. Bingo. Mm. Baby, more bubbly? Mmm, bring it on, kitten. [ Humming ] Oh, my god. I know that voice. You should. You hear him every morning at 5:00 A.M. Oh, my god! This is my worst nightmare! I just took another Viagra, darling, so, uh, give me a few minutes to get little Joe up and running. Oh, yeah! ♪ It's Valentine's day with my baby ♪ ♪ just me and my baby ♪ Oh. ♪ So, cupid, draw back your bow ♪ ♪ and let it go at papa Joe ♪ Mm. [ Both breathe deeply ] Let's make a Valentine's toast, shall we? Mm. To you... Mm-hmm. ...to me... [ Giggles ] ...and little blue pills. [ Both laugh ] [ Joe purrs ] Ah, la, la, la, la. Mm. Mm, sippy sips. Mm! Mm! Mm! Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm! Oh! Oh, baby! I loathe Joe Biggs. How can I sink to this? It's a fine line between love and hate. That and your liquor-addled mind and propped-up libido finally got the best of you. What shall we do? Even Joe started to look good. I can't look. [ Both moaning ] Trust me, it gets worse. [ Both chuckle, purr ] [ Joe moaning ] Oh, is that the right spot, baby? [ Gasping ] What? What? Whoa! [ Coughs ] Baby? Oh, baby? Uh, okay. Hold on. Hold on. One. Come on. Two. Come on, baby. Stick with me. Oh, god. I die in Joe Biggs' arms? Yep. Late-night binges and Viagra-driven sex finally catch up with you. Get me out of here. [ Joe grunting ] Just one more stop. But I got to warn you, it's a downer. [ Church bell tolls ] "Love stinks"? Mm-hmm. Well, why does it say that on my gravestone? Oh, I forgot to tell you. In your later years, you wrote a bitter novel about the vagaries of love. It was a best seller. [ Scoffs ] Great. Well, the good news is that you had a lovely funeral, honey. Most of your ex-husbands dutifully attended. That's nice. Mm. Well, the bad news... Is that you and I are the first ones to visit your grave since. Are you saying nobody cares about me? [ Sighs ] Nobody loves you, ally. Night-night. Jackie! Jackie! Please don't tell me that I'm dead! Jackie! [ Knock on door ] [ Gasps, panting ] I'm alive. I'm alive. [ Doorbell ringing, knocking continues ] Lisa, what are you doing here? What do you mean, what am I doing here? You're getting married in two hours. Please don't tell me you're just getting up. Okay, I won't. But I did. I don't believe this. Well, just be thankful I'm not 50 years old and making out with Joe Biggs. What? Never mind. Okay, will you please just let me in and then get in the shower? No. Wait. I-I have a better idea. Ally, are you gonna let me in?! Uh, hold on. I'll be with you in one second. [ Cellphone beeping ] [ Grunts ] Okay, here. Go to that address and make the guy who answers as handsome as humanly possible no matter what he says. Then put him in a tux and bring him to the wedding, and... And don't take no for an answer. Got it? Got it. But what about you? I have a guy to see about a thing. Saint Mark's, pill hill. Hurry. [ Tires squeal ] [ Horn honks ] [ Church bell tolling ] [ Door opens, closes ] Matt! Matt, Matt, Matt! [ Voice breaking ] I... I don't want you to go to prison. And I don't want you to be homeless. And I don't want to sleep with Joe Biggs. Ally, what's wrong? Where's your dress? I feel like I've lived a lifetime in the last 24 hours. It's okay. It's okay, sweetie. Everybody gets a little... Nervous before they get married. Matt, we can't get married. Oh. Uh... you know what? I'm just gonna be outside. Yeah. What do you mean we can't get married? Why not? Jackie said it would be the biggest mistake of my life. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just slow down for a second. Who's Jackie? Your therapist? Sort of. I'm confused. [ Gasps ] Me too! Matt, I can't find ally anywhere. Mom, just give us a sec, will you? Oh. [ Sighs ] Before you say anything else, there's something that I have to tell you. Something that I should've told you a long time ago. I just hope that you can forgive me for not being honest with you. - Okay. - [ Sighs ] The only thing in the entire world that I love, aside from you, is... Music. Yeah, w... How did you know that? Did Dez tell you? No. I, uh... I saw you. I was there last night. Um... It was like I was seeing somebody else, somebody new. There's more. I want to quit the firm. I want to play music for a living. And I think I want to get to know that person, because I think I might be in love with that person. Really? [ Sighs ] Okay. If that's what you want. Okay. I guess we should probably go tell our guests. [ Indistinct conversations ] - Oh, there she is. - Oh, here we go. - Oh. - She's wearing jeans. [ Guests murmuring ] What is going on? Uh, everyone, um... Matt and I... [ Sighs ] Matt and I... M-Matt and I... We're not getting married today. [ Guests gasp ] What? But it's... it's not because I don't love him. I do. I love him more than I thought I could ever love anybody. Oh, my goodness. But I... Then why the heck aren't you getting married? [ Sighs ] Do you love him? Yes, I love him. Who is she talking to? I think she's lost it. Do you love him for all the right reasons? I do. Then what's the hold-up? Hey, I was just over at the reception, and I got to tell you, girl, those ice sculptures are already half-melted. You're right. [ Clears throat ] I'm ready. For all the right reasons. Matt, will you marry me? In a heartbeat. [ Cheers and applause ] Dearly beloved, we're gathered together here in the sight of god, and in the face of this congregation, to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony. Look at that. [ Camera shutter clicks ] [ Cheers and applause ] [ Crying ] Hey, come on, man. [ French accent ] Are you okay? Yeah. Enchanté. Hi. Paul. Would you like to dance? Uh, yeah. Come on. Hi. I'm Ben. "You make my heart float. The sweetness that is your eyes, I long from afar." [ Applause ] Aww! Oh, my god. You are freaking gorgeous. [ Guests murmur ] [ Laughs ] So, love finally spoke to ally Simms with a little help from yours truly. Matt and ally had their Valentine wedding, tennis shoes and all. But they did something even better. They fell in love. [ Door opens ] [ Angelic music plays ] [ Twinkle! ] Ally! I got it! I love you, honey. Ooh! [ Chuckles ] Everything all right? Never been better. Happy Valentine's day, wife. [ Chuckles ] I love you, husband.
