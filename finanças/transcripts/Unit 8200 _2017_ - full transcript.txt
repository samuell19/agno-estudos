♪ ♪ Second to Silicon valley in Start-Up industry Maybe you can go back and tell me how you three guys got together and came up with this crazy idea. A couple of years after all of us were discharged from the military we just each went his own way and at some point we realized okay, we are pretty bored with what we do today. We kept thinking that we want to do something special. Something different. So we started looking at different areas until we learned about the world of connected cars. ♪ Oron: Cars are way more computerized than we realize. You have dozens of different computers in each vehicle. Almost everything you can imagine is somehow controlled by a computer. In the recent years it became almost a trend to connect vehicles to the internet. Once you take such a complicated machine that has so much software in it and so many computers and you connect it with the internet, you have a serious problem. How do you start your day? What kind of questions are you asking each other when it comes to your industry, of course? So the first steps, we took our old cars and we tried to hack them. And it was fun, it was nice, and but then we really understood, look, this is possible. We need to do something about it. Ofer: It's going to be a massive global problem, and I think that the risk is enormous. Martin: So how do you guys know how to do all this stuff? The three of us served together in the military, in Unit 8200. In the 8200 Unit. We have served for six years together in the 8200 Intelligence Unit. ♪ ♪ ♪ Unit 8200 is the backbone of the Israeli intelligence community, and it's also a hotbed for Israeli hi-tech. In recent years, when the name of the game is cyber, offensive cyber, defensive cyber, Unit 8200 is there among the top four, five leaders in the world. The exact comparison is the US NSA, the British General Communication Headquarters. Hello? I would say that the harsh reality of the region and the neighborhood where Israel lives, is the driving force behind the intelligence community to develop the best technological skills in order to have the edge over the enemy. Most of the Unit 8200 employees, workers, are conscripts and the mandatory age in Israel for national service is 18, so we are talking about 18, 19, young boys, if you wish. Martin: And girls. And girls, yes. They have also girls. You have very young people. Young teenagers who have already homemade, homegrown skills to be hackers, to penetrate computers to intercept information. ♪ ♪ Definitely send me over an email and maybe we can... Alright, I'll do that. Great. Thanks. ♪ So what we present here is the Argus connectivity protection modules. This is essentially protecting the entertainment telematics systems inside the car. We can see that about 10 minutes ago there was some malicious activity there. So the Argus connectivity protection gives a solution to things misbehaving inside the car. So this is something that we would be able to detect. This is a simulation of a car. Let's imagine that you are a driver and you received some link and you clicked on that link. You reached a website which happened to be a malicious website. Okay. And now there is a hacker inside your head unit. So everything's at risk. Your whole car is now infected. I'm excited to be here at CES. It's amazing. Here in the big leagues. We are working here with Intel, with Qualcomm, one of the biggest communications companies in the world. They chose to put our product inside a Maserati. What we're going to demonstrate is a cyber attack against the system. Okay, so now I'm installing the virus here, and now things are going to start getting crazy here in the car. It's actively playing around with the various systems of the car, playing with the speedometer, with the rpms, the door locks, windows. Additionally, it can affect the steering wheel, so if I have electric steering it can move the steering wheel to all sides. It can affect the driving. ♪ ♪ The questions is, what happens on those other peaks. Separate point two over there... Most of our staff are graduates of the 8200 Unit. Hi guys, how's it going? Yaron: They do what is called partition testing. What it means is that we take a car, and we try to hack it. And we do that in order to find the vulnerable spots so we can help fix it. There's no script of how to hack a car. There's no straightforward way of how to do it. And you need to somehow figure out a way even though the manufacturer did not intend for this to be possible. We take the radio and we break it apart and we see how it's working. How the different pieces communicate with each other. We found that it was communicating with the server in a way that is not secured. And so we were able to impersonate the server. And by that we were able really to inject commands to the vehicle. So that we were able, for example, to unlock the door of the car. Or shut down the engine of the car. Things like that remotely through the server connection. - Yeah He's supposed to be very good. Yaron: Ami is managing a team of researchers. So on a daily basis, basically, Ami's team is really putting on the hacker hat and trying to do those things to those cars. And those guys, they will figure out a way. Oron is leading the effort of developing the solutions. Protecting the cars and fleets, making it much more difficult for the attackers to hack into cars. We have the best attackers and the best defenders and really Research and Development what makes the best defenders the best is because they know how attackers think and because we have this mix in the company, we can continuously improve the solutions that we provide. Anyway, the plan is to complete these soon, right? - Hopefully yes. They said this will be a great improvement and it will require very little work. It's no secret that cyber security is a major aspect in the intelligence core in the military, and when we started Argus we realized that our experience and knowhow with cyber security is something important and something that we can use to build something great. The Stuxnet virus, the idea was invented, or initiated in the Israeli intelligence. And teams of the two countries, of NSA in the US and Unit 8200 started working to develop the code. The idea was to penetrate the Iranian nuclear site, gather information on what's going on there and thirdly, once we know what's going on there, how can we damage it, slow it down, disrupt the operation? This material is produced independently for NTI by the James Martin Center for Nonprotifa at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey and does not necessarily re of and has not been independently verified by NTI or its directors, officers, employees, or ♪ The only way to penetrate Natanz was by creating a virus, but such a virus that would be so sophisticated that it would damage the centrifuges producing the enriched uranium but it would damage it in such a way that the operators, the Iranian's operators, would not notice that something went wrong. ♪ The Stuxnet virus was a success in the sense that one third of the centrifuges at the time, means 1,000 centrifuges, were damaged, were not producing the enriched uranium as it was programmed, and the Iranians didn't notice. Didn't know what was the problem. They became very, very desperate. The idea of Stuxnet was not just to damage the machines. The idea was, had also a psychological purpose. To make the Iranian engineers, technicians, computer experts, to make them feel that they are stupid. That there is a problem, that the machines are not working properly and they cannot figure out what is the problem. ♪ In September 2007, when the Israeli government decided to destroy the Syrian nuclear reactor, they used the skill of Unit 8200 which blinded the Syrian radars so they seemed to be operational to their operators, that the system is working, but practically, it was blind. It saw nothing, enabling the Israeli Air Force to carry out the, and launch the missiles that destroyed the reactor. I think that the experience that we have as hackers for many, many years of hacking different systems is vital to this industry. I think this is what makes us unique, and maybe also important in the same manner. ♪ Both areas have lots of problems. My name is Amos Shalev. Now we need to divide our resources and manpower.. But everybody calls me Ami. Plans for the future... In Argus my main job is to hack cars. To understand the whole system and later on to protect it. ♪ I can shut down motor, whatever I want, when you are driving, let's say, on the highway. I can cancel your brakes, I can make the car turn. If one would like to do a lot of harm, terrorism, or murder someone, yeah, it can definitely be done by controlling his car, knowing where he is, when he is doing what he is doing, and to manipulate the car. It's not to be smarter than the one who designed it. It's just to show that you are capable of getting into his mind or design and to break it. But it doesn't have to do only with technology, it could be whatever. It could of some music. I think everything for me starts with music. I started to learn piano when I was six. At one stage I started to research what I can do that's not on the notes. And since then all my life I'm always trying to find what is going to be the next new music. And writing in the logic of computers can be very similar to art and also for some sort of music. The similarity of music to mathematical features, and to logical features like loops, when you are improvising all the time, it's some sort of research. Because everybody is taking their melodies and ideas and bringing them to the band. In the world that's going to have around 400 million cars connected and sharing information via the internet with nowadays technology, it can definitely be a hacker's dream. Otto's trucks are the next area of transportation innovation. And then once you're on the interstate, one switch and it's driving itself down the road. ♪ ♪ The problem is imminent right now. It's going to take time until 200 million cars speak to each other, but the first thing that we have to do is create cars that on the one hand, can become connected cars in the future, autonomous connected cars. And so I believe the problem is something that we have to deal with immediately. We cannot wait for ten years when 200 million cars are connected because if we're gonna start getting hacks right now, that future that you're talking about is just not going to happen. ♪ Up until 15 years ago, I was serving in Unit 8200... Nadav: We're talking about an era where cyber offense is taking a large toll on our economy. Cyber criminals, hactivists, cyber terrorism. ♪ You just have to look at the sheer numbers. I mean estimates are that 2015 was around half a trillion dollars of damage in cyber security. Estimations are that by 2020 that number is going to quadruple. You are now inside an "integrative war room". Hackers are gaining access to the vehicle itself. Nadav: A lot of our industries today are getting more digital, more connected. They're all about data and trust. And if you don't have data and trust, you're losing a great part of the economy. So you put these two things together and you look at the trajectory of getting more connector, more digital, then obviously cyber security becomes paramount. And many companies are trying to do it, including us in Team8. We try to build the most innovative, efficient and effective companies in cyber security today. Let's sit over there. We work with Sysco, Microsoft, and with AT&T and with Tomasic. I'm writing the notes now. - Looks good. The 8200 brand is really catching on around the world. Everybody knows those 8200 guys. It's like almost saying those guys that came from MIT, or those guys who came from Stanford. Do you think that 8200 philosophy which you were very much involved in building is going to revolutionize how people look at maybe training, education in these fields? I believe so. We get them at a very young age. But we get them for a very short time. And so if you're going to train them for five, six, seven years like universities do, then it's worthless. The philosophy around the 8200 education system is just more adaptive. It's much faster. In many ways naiveté becomes your friend and inexperience becomes an asset. Ultimately, every once in a while they come up with a magical solution to an unsolvable problem. And in that instance you know that you've got an advantage that's going to stay with you for an unknown amount of time. Can you give us... Case in point, you've got three companies running, from which viewpoint are these three companies running to combat cyber security? With Illusive Networks, what we do is look at the network, not from the IT's perspective, but from the attacker's perspective. ♪ ♪ The hardest thing, honestly, when you attack a large network is not penetrating it, but rather the orientation and propagation once you're inside the network. And we said, "If it's about the people behind the malware and not the malware, what if we can disrupt the decision making processes of the people behind the malware?" What if we can fool them so that rather than passively waiting for them to do something, we'll actually lure them into making the mistakes. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ In this conference we are trying to achieve two things One, is to maintain our position as market leaders. And the second thing, we have announced a new product called "Fingerprinting" Which essentially is a completely new technology for us and we think it's going to revolutionize the world of automotive cyber security. So just as an example, we show first a potential attack, we have here a setup of instrument cluster. We send it to Infineon because we are using a cheap set of Infineon. And instead of the yellow spike, there will be a red spike. You see? Which means that all the attacks were blocked. "Fingerprinting", which essentially is able to identify each computer in the car and it's completely a new concept of protection in automotive so we are quite excited about it as well. Have you announced it already? Yeah it was announced yesterday morning. And what was the reaction you're getting? Super, super, super positive! All in all, I'm very satisfied with this conference. Our last few meetings were very promising. It's good to get feedback from the market, s important to see what our competition is working o We had lots of clients and partners present. What kind of response did you get on our new product? It was really exciting to see how everyone is amazed by the innovation, by our abilit to bring new solutions to the market. People can't get their head around how we even do it Look, it's a problem that everyone needs solved. They all need help. Looks like we're going to have quite a lot of work for years to come. It's going to be interesting! What about next steps for Argus? Our next steps will be to bring our technology leadership into production. To have our systems installed by 2018 on different cars globally. That's definitely a great asset, because we are facing some difficulties finding skilled people. Israel is a good "pot" of potential cyber security experts. Which in Italy is not so easy to find. ♪ ♪ During the negotiations between Iran and the world powers, Iranian delegations were staying in hotels. Unit 8200 managed to infiltrate the hotels that they were staying. The hotels were bugged, the hotels were penetrated and infiltrated with malware and viruses which not only tried to listen to telephone conversations and to dig information from computers but also to penetrate security cameras and if needed, even to change what the security cameras were showing or were seeing. If there is an assassination carried out by the Mossad, and they want to rig the security camera, nowadays, you can do it from a room in Tel Aviv to penetrate the security cameras or to break into doors. With all these digital codes on hotel keys, you can do it from thousand, or 2000 or 3000 kilometers away. That's what Unit 8200 is doing all the time, around the clock and especially it's much more busy and intense when the Israeli military is carrying out operations. These conscripts come from a very solid and good background because at high school they are good students, but also because they already practice and experience the skills needed for Unit 8200 by being hackers, for example. Inbal: Your 18 year old, your 19 year old, they were mostly interested in girls and boys and parties and fashion and music and movies. Not being an Intel officer. So how do you assess who is relevant for those types of positions? And it's all based on how do you cope with not knowing? When you're stuck, what do you do? So for a college graduate from MIT or Stanford, they will dive into materials and learn for a long period of time, for a few weeks or months, everything they need to learn. For an 8200 grad, the process would look differently. And actually, getting stuck, in a way, and not knowing answers is a major part of the modus operandum. Because you actually constantly don't know what you're about to solve, or to achieve and how to achieve that. Is it the financial sector of the government? - The government. I'm happy to announce that "Business Insider" has written about us. We've been selected as one of the 38 most promising cyber companies in 2017. I spent almost five years in 8200 from training till managing and leading the officer's school. So 2016 ended well for us? - Very well. Sixgill is a company that we cofounded about three years ago, focusing specifically on the dark web activity. ♪ Inbal: The dark web is the hidden part of the internet where information is shared in an encrypt and anonymous way. This enables criminal activity in the dark web of different sorts. One of the main criminal activities we see there is against financial institutions. And that's where our business is actually focusing. On identifying threats to financial institutions before they even occur. ♪ You are part of a program that tries to foster start-up growth by potential candidates. What's the ultimate goals? Inbal: So I just joined as co-CEO of True Synthesis, a US based company. And what we're trying to do is actually to help you, if you are an investor, private equity firm, a board of director, select the top talent to join your executive team, or even to lead as CEO of the company. We believe that there should be a new approach, a more developed approach toward hiring people, placing people, working and developing people. The philosophy we're using, the model we're using is based on my experience in 8200. The capability of acquiring knowledge is part of the secret sauce. The capability of not being paralyzed by not knowing something, that's part of the skill set. And then whatever we need to learn, we'll do that very rapidly. ♪ I know this is the moment that everyone's been waiting for.

They shouldn't be looking only at the CVs, because the CVs are dimensional, they show only one layer. They should challenge the person. They should see how that person is actually facing things they don't know. - I'm not sure... - We have to look at the prejeet description. They barely incorporate any cyber solutions. I founded seven years ago, on behalf of the 8200 Alumni Association, Israel's first accelerator. These are the characteristics we're looking for: A unified team, The 8200 entrepreneurship and innovation support program is aimed on fostering and nurturing first time entrepreneurs and actually increasing their chances for success. Another feature to look for: Do they have an understanding of the market? Bringing together the 8200 network, philosophy and, if you want, DNA. And the vision, that's right, "think big". Can you go over this application? I love it when the applicants mention their family as an accomplishment. Yeah, "proud father of two girls"... You have to take into consideration if their English is.. - Terrible. And the screening process that we do in our accelerator, I think looks completely different from other accelerators in Israel and around the world. We're not necessarily focused on the product, the idea. We're much more focused on the persona, on the team, the founding team, how they work together. We're screening all the applications that we got, hundreds of applications. At the end of the process, we should have only 20 participants that will be admitted to the 2017 cycle. Cyber insurance... That's interesting. Cyber insurance is cool. If wedon't know much about the field I guess it's a good place for a start-up. I see a team here that looks ready for an interview... A solid group with 4 team members from diverse backgrounds... They've developed sophisticated technology an area that combines online and offline informatio I think this could be very interesting. And all this is for free, right? I mean, that's important. Yes. We feel that as 8200 alums, we were privileged. Serving in this military unit has given us so much. To who we grew up to be. Not everyone was that privileged. And we want to give back. And we want to give back by doing what we know how to do best. How would you turn your app into a truly gneat prioduct? Maybe incorporate a comparison of prices, so that customers can see the options. Sorry to interrupt, your next meeting is with "Inspector" here in the back. "Steps End" you'll sit now with Ori, who's right over there. So, one of the most interesting companies I met in social programming at the Speed Dating was a company that was actually founded by a stutterer, someone with a speech impairment. He just found a solution to a problem to a problem that a lot of people have and it makes them feel embarrassed, makes them feel ashamed. And he came to this program to build an app that will help thousands, or millions of people with speech impairments. Why a Chatbot? To help people practice their therapy at home, which they hate doing. Have you heard of a foundation called "Aspire"? They're now raising 100 million dollars to create the first digital hospital. And if there's anything a digital hospital would be looking for it's a Chatbot. It's a real hype now. Think about it. I can introduce you to them The best thing I can help those startups is teach them how to fail. Teach them how to fail fast. Let's say, you have funding for 12 months. If you create a lot of small experiments that each of them takes a month or month and a half, then you have enough time and money for 10 experiments. Fail fast, you'll try more things. Eventually, you'll tweak it enough and hopefully you'll be a success. It sounds like your project needs a good kick in the ass because it's a great idea that's probably progessing very slowly... Right now we're a piece of junk with great potential. You got the engine of a Porsche, with the exterior of a Renault 5. Look I'm definitely going to meet with you again. You'll have to accept this. - I'd be happy to. So Monday? ♪ No, but it doesn't mean that it went down. Somewhere here. The mouse here is terrible. I started a company that did software development at the age of 15. What we created was the software that helped soldiers in the field to look where they are on the map and send commands. That was between 15 to 18. Great three years. Then I actually started making money. It was the first time in my life that I felt like, okay, I can help my family. My parents are divorced, my mom is a single parent. I felt a little bit, I would say, a discomfort because I'm making more than my mom and dad. And I'm just 16 and I'm making five figures. So I spent five years in 8200, an amazing five years. I would say that even now, ten years after I was discharged, that was still the most challenging time, the most rewarding time. When you get to solve really tough problems and you really feel you are saving lives. There's no room for failure. Because you know that if you'll fail, bad things will happen. Bad things will happen in Israel. Bad things might happen in your city. And I used to tell 8200 p0rospects, "Did you know that we stopped two bombings in Kfar Saba this week?" You don't? Why not? Because 8200 is here. One of the commanders of 8200, he used to quote this philosopher that said, what's hard, we do quite easily, the impossible takes a little bit more time. So, that is basically what drives 8200. You guys do have access to the C panel, which basically can give you access to the file server. After five years in 8200, first of all, you think that there's no other challenge in the world that would be as great as the challenge that you've just witnessed. And by the way, that is true. If you click these, you can like, install WordPress. What did 8200 give you to create the companies that you created and to move ahead? The year was 2008. For the first time, I was out there trying to be a founder of something. I teamed up with three other friends, at least two of them were 8200 alumni. And we started our own company that did social games on Facebook as a platform. Do you have two factor authentication for anything? For some things. Like your email? Yeah, passwords or betas. I think it was two years it took us to understand that while we have tons of users, we're not making any money, and we have no idea what we're doing. That was the first failure in a series of failures to come. I think that being a serial entrepreneur is actually being a serial failure. Basically, you try and you try and you try and you just hope that one of those things will actually work. And we started a company that was called Ajillion. That company was an advertising technology company. And it really quickly, it became a successful company. We raised 75 million dollars and took the company public for 250 million dollars. A lot of people used to ask me, "I never thought you knew how to take a company public." and I would say, yeah, me too. But you know, they told us that this was what they want to do, so we've learned and we did it. Hey. Hello. Sorry to bother you. I met Ran Goldi just before high school. A few years later we met again at the army. We were together at the 8200 Unit. And there is "Mid-market" which is a new system. Nice. Ami: He is very hands on. And he was really good at knowing everybody in the Unit and how to move projects through people, how to move people into projects.

We take a car and we try to hack it. And we do that in order to find the vulnerable spot so we can help fix it. ECU fingerprinting is something that we are very excited about. You have different systems inside the vehicle and they communicate with each other. The communication infrastructure in the vehicle is built in such a way that you cannot tell which system sent a specific message to the other system. And this allows the attacker to potentially inject messages and it may tell the brakes to engage, even though they shouldn't. So we develop a technology to pinpoint exactly which system in the car sent each message. And we do that by physically fingerprinting the different components in the car. Because we can do that the attacker is not able to impersonate the systems in the car anymore, because it relies on physical characteristics of the different systems. This approach is potentially much more cost-effective and this is generating a lot of interest from our clients for sure. ♪ Imagine you drive a car, you click some link which appears to be malicious. When that happens, a virus has intruded the system and the car has been hacked. So what I'll do now is start the active prevention here at Argus. And what you can notice is that suddenly nothing is happening in the car. Everything is quiet. The windows are no longer opening and closing. The doors are not unlocking and locking. And I can drive safely back home. Thiis is something we're going to look in to, because we're interested in expanding our solution's. Thank you, thank you very much. ♪ We have a sales of about 35 billion dollars with more than 310 manufacturing locations employing about 150,000 people across the world. The one distinguishing factor with Argus, it actually can monitor the activity of the data and when it senses something that is not normal it's able to take whatever action is needed to prevent any illegal activity happening. That's why we partnered with them and we see this partnership to be very useful and very impactful in the industry going forward. The fact that they believe in Argus is a huge confidence by such a company in a small startup from Israel and to have them installing us on their hardware and bring us into the vehicles, it's phenomenal. Yoni, where is the next meeting? We have another demo with Freescale NXP one of the biggest chip manufacturers for the automotive industry. No doubt that a lot of what we are doing here is due to what we've done in the background for the 8200 intelligence. Very impressive. It's a long process. Excellent, very good job. Thank you. I think that the market would not perceive us as experts in cyber security without that background. 8200 is essentially a brand of confidence in cyber capability globally. It's well known, it comes up in many customer meetings. What's the future? The future is to be installed hopefully in every single new vehicle five years down the line. That's what we are hoping that we are working so hard to. We hope to do it. 20 years ago, hackers were considered to be criminals. Later on, at least the recruiters of Unit 8200 realized that there is a potential in them. They don't treat them anymore as criminals but as genius. 8200, they teach you how to be an entrepreneur, without even telling you that that's what they're doing. No, you don't have 30 developers, you have you and you and you and this guy. I just have to do it. There's no other option but succeeding in the mission.
