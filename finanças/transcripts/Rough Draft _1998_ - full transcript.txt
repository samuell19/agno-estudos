-Someone's sitting there. -You're very observant. -Where have you been? -Out and about. -What's her name? -Oh, Erica. You know there's only you. -You're funny. I saw you walking with a woman outside. You have very good taste in women, Stefan. -Well, that is a complement to us both. -Thank you. -Ugh. -Nice dress. -Thank you. -You're new here. -It's the first time I've been here. -Do you mind? I'm dying. -There you go. -You know Stefan? -I just met him. -You should be flattered. He rarely talks to anyone. -Oh. Are those implants? -Please. I'm having the operation next month. -Oh. -Tissue? -It was either that or grapefruits. -You are new. -Yes. -Um, would you? -There you go. -Ah. You have a little smudge there. -It's tough being a woman. -It's murder. -You guys get me out of bed this time of night, it better be one of mine. -See for yourself. Mind you, don't stand in the blood. Young, cute, and unzipped like an overnight bag. -[laugh] -And what the fuck is so funny? -Sure looks like one of his. -Well, the papers will give him one by morning. Did you find anything yet? Get me a cup of coffee. Get all these spectators out of here. Get them back-- way back. -Fuck. -We're going to start back there and work our way up. -All right. -Inch by inch. -OK. -What's with him? -That's what I'm trying to figure out. See you later, Joe. -OK. -Hello Mrs. Morris. -Hello Mr. Keece. -Would you like to see my tattoo? -I've already seen it. -Oh, yeah. [laugh] OK. Goodnight. -Night. MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): That's my man. MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): Oh, no. MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): Yes. Why? What did you think? MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): I am so depressed. MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): Why? -Because I want you, darling. -Jamie, you never had a-- -Hi. -Hi. How did it go? -Good. Take a look. -Hmm. MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): Well I don't need you anymore. MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): Why? What did I ever do to you? MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): Well you wouldn't sit in the jacuzzi with me. You were-- -Hey. Um, come to bed. -No. -I don't want you yawning tomorrow at the picnic. -Picnic? OK. Let me save this. -OK. -I'll be right there. Good. Good. (FEMALE VOICE) Would you like for me to strip for you? This was easier getting on. -It's nice. I don't recognize any of it. -You didn't have the style I was looking for. -Oh. Well, nor the size, I hope. So who's your outfitter? -Armani. -Ah. You're not cheap. [laugh] -The Salvation Armani. The stockings are yours. I put a hole in mine. Ahh. -Let me get that. -Oh. Is this turning you on? -[laugh] -Huh? Is it turning you on? -Only the stockings are mine? -Oh. I used a dab of your perfume. -Mhm. Do you know how expensive that is? -No. Mmm. -You really only need a little bit. Right-- right there. -Oh. -Definitely here. -Oh. -Here. -Oh. -And here. -Yeah, definitely there. [laugh] Good morning. OK. Wake up, sleepy head. -OK. [laugh] Ah! -Wake up. Get up. -Ugh. -Come on, come on. -Ah. -Aren't you going to take a shower? -Why? -I don't believe it. -What? -The picnic. -The picnic's not until this afternoon. -It is the afternoon. -Oh. OK. Let me get this stuff down while it's still fresh. That was beautiful last night. That was so amazing. -Nelson-- -Why don't you go ahead? I'll meet you there. -What do you mean you'll meet me there? This picnic is for us? My parents want to meet you. -I'm coming. Did I say I wasn't coming? You're obsessed. -I'm a journalist. This is what I do for a living. -Well it's not normal. It's scary. -It's research. -It's like when you wrote that article on the drunks. -Alcoholics. -You ended up spending three months crawling the walls in withdrawal. What's it going to be next time, Nelson? -That's a lousy attitude. -You know, why don't you write an article through the eyes of Nelson Keece? I sure would like to read it. -No, Jules. -You know, the next thing I know, you're going to be writing an article about suicides. And the first I'll hear about it is you cruising past the kitchen window. -It'd be kind of hard to finish the story. -Yeah? Well, just take your computer with you and write it on the way down. -That's a good one. I haven't sold anything in eight months-- not since the piece about alcoholics. Eight months, honey. I'm broke. I need another hit. -Who's been paying the bills in the meantime? -Well, you have. I knew you'd say that. -I'll see you later. -Nice dress. -I bet you'd never guess where I've seen you before. -So how'd you know my name? -I've been part of your audience this past week. It's Maria Sanchez, right? -Oh. You were in court. -Yes. I'm just an observer-- a frustrated lawyer, actually. I've seen many lawyers, and you're quite impressive. Ah! So much for the great weather! Ahh! -Ah! -Let's duck in here. Did they forecast rain for today? -I don't know. -Sorry. It was-- it was overly ambitious of me. -It's OK. I-- I've-- I don't normally walk into alleyways with strangers. -Uh-huh. Neither do I. Neither do I. -Um, do you live near here or? -I saw you in the courtroom. You dominated it. Where do you get such power? -Um, [uncomfortable laugh] don't. -Your skin is so soft. -Don't. -I knew it would be. -Oh. You're moving too fast. Show me your power. Where do you get such power? -What are you talking about? Don't. -Show me your power, Maria. That's what I need. Where do you get such power? -Oh, Jesus. Hello, police. I just recorded murder. Please listen. Ah! -Who are you? -Hey, hey, hey. What's your problem, man? -What? -Are you all right, man? -You OK? -I could tell from here that that was him again. You know, if we don't get a break with this guy soon, man, the press is going to have a field day with us. -What do you care what the press has to say? -It's not that I care. It's just my first high profile case. I just want it to go well, if that's all right with you. -Remember Jack the Ripper? -Yeah. -Well, I never caught him. Let's just take a look around and see what we can find. -All right. -Officer. Officer. -Sir will you sign this? -Hey! -I know you. Where do I know you from? -We met in a club last night. My name is Nelson Keece. I'm a journalist. -A journalist. How interesting. What do you write about? -Unusual situations. -Is this unusual enough for you? -Now. Who the fuck are you? MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): This is what I need. This is what I want. Where do you get such power? Are you following me? -I'm doing a story on transvestites. I saw you in the park with that girl, so I followed you. -Are you a good writer? -I won an award last year. -You want to write about me? I'd like that. -You're not just saying that to make me feel good, are you? -No. I'd really like that. -I mean, you'll interview me and everything? -Yes. -Good. Good. Then we have a deal? -Yeah. -Then let's seal it in blood. -Ah. Ooh. MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): It's what I want. Where do you get such power? -So. What happened? Where were you? -It doesn't matter. -It doesn't matter. What happened to your hand? -I don't want to talk about it now. -Well, do you think you could at least to explain to me why you didn't show up at the picnic? Fucking Nelson, talk to me. Be a man. Tell me what happened. -I'll tell you what happened. I saw a murder. That's what happened. I almost got killed and you want to sit here and talk about a fucking picnic. -Juliette. Wait. Come here! Come here. Juliette, you don't understand. Juliette-- Juliette, where are you going? -Beautiful girl. Why is she leaving you? -It's a long story. -It's not because of us, is it Nelson? -Us? No. She doesn't know anything about us. -Well, that's just as well. I'm ready. -Ready for work? -Our interview. -Now? -Yes. I have so much to tell you. Let's go inside. -Does it have to be tonight? I'm not prepared. -We had an agreement, Nelson. -I know we do, but I need a little more time to prepare. -So you would know which questions to ask me? -Ah. Exactly. -Ah, I see. Hmm. How about tomorrow then? -Uh, tomorrow would be better. -Nelson, can I hear the tape again? -It's upstairs and I've just started working on it. -I'm not being too pushy, am I? -No. -Tomorrow, then. -Ahh. FEMALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): 911 emergency. -Police-- I need to talk to someone about the girl who was murdered last night. FEMALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): Which one? -Which one? The girl in the alleyway off Market Street. Her name was Maria. I got it on tape. I recorded the whole thing. FEMALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): Sir? Hello? Hello? -Hello. -Do you need some help, sir? Yes, sir, I do. I need to talk to someone about the murder with the girl in the alleyway of Market Street. -Over there. Take a seat and someone will see you. -Over there? Excuse me. -Hey, take a seat, man. We'll get to you in a second. -I need to talk to someone about the murder last night. -Your turn is when you get to that end of the line. -I have it on tape. -Great. We'll all sit together and watch it. -No, no. It's not a videotape. This is crazy. -Oh, no. [laugh] What is that on your head, bro? -It's what they call a hat. -Damn! [laugh] -My favorite hat. -I've never seen the hat before. You look like you belong in "The Grapes of Wrath." [laugh] -OK, Frenchie. Why don't you just do your work? -I can't get to work with you wearing that ugly ass hat. All right. Let's see what we got here. Forensics, statements, evidence found in the alleyway, a uh, a first unit report, station calls, and related 911 calls, man. There's nothing that leaps out at you. -Well, that's why they call us detectives. Did you always want to be a cop, Laroue? -OK. Here we go. Yo, you know, I'm getting really tired of the way you talk to me, man. -I just asked you a simple question. -No, man. It's not that you asked me a simple question. It's the way you asked me. You're always talking down to me, Haynes. Why? -What is it? Some of the guys think-- fuck it. I think-- -OK. I know where you're going. Everybody thinks I'm taking this case too personally, right? -Something like that. -That I shouldn't even be on it, right? -I'll tell you a little story. My, uh, daughter, 10 years ago, kidnapped and killed-- 10 years ago. They never caught the guy. He disappeared, got away. You think I'm taking it personally? I don't think that this is the same guy, all right? I don't believe it. So put your mind at ease. I want to catch this son of a bitch as bad as any of you guys. But when we get him, I want to personally chop his fucking head off. OK? -Haynes. -Yeah. -This 911 call came in about 30 minutes ago. The guy knew the victim's name. FEMALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): 911 emergency. KEECE (ON PHONE): Poliec-- I need to talk to someone about the girl who was murdered last night. FEMALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): Which one? KEECE (ON PHONE): Which one? The girl in the alleyway off Market Street. Her name was Maria. I got it on tape. I recorded the whole thing. FEMALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): Sir? Hello? Hello? -Oh, shit. He's in the corridor. FEMALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): Hello? -You see him? -Excuse me. -Bro, give me back 21. -21? -Here. MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): So I saw you. You had the leather cock piece on. MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): Baby, if I wasn't taken, I'd want all of you. MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): Oh, I am so available for you. MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): Yeah? You were-- -Take this down to the lab with that 911 tape. Laroue. -Yeah. -What did he look like? -Kind of a early 40s, light features, about 180 pounds. -Before you forget, put his face in the computer and see if you can get a match. -Procedure. Yeah, I know. -Hello? -Nelson, it's me. -Stefan. -I've had an idea, Nelson. -What's that? -There's something you should see? -What's that? -How I work. Can you meet me at the corner of Third and Cherokee in 20 minutes? -Cherokee and Third. -Yes. -There's a newsstand there. I know it's short notice, but-- -Stefan. -Yes, Nelson? -There's something I have to make clear to you. -OK. -While I'm writing this story on you, uh-- -Just go ahead and say it, Nelson. -I want you to stop killing. -Ahh. This is not about killing. This is about the pursuit. -So we understand each other? -Absolutely. -I'll be there. FEMALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): Police department. May I help you? Hello? [phone ringing] JULIETTE (ON RECORDING): Hi. Leave a message for Nelson or Juliette. JULETTE (ON PHONE): Hey, Nelson. It's me. Do you think you could set aside your work for maybe an hour and come and meet me at the lounge tonight? Uh, I really think we should talk. OK. Bye. -Excuse me. Have you seen a young lady come in here with the curly brown hair? -Um, I think she went down that aisle. -Have you read the Oxford New Press version? -Uh, no. I haven't. -It's Lori, isn't it? -How do you know my name? -Your name tag. -Yeah. I'm not wearing it. -You work at the newsstand, right? -I don't remember you. Should I? -Well, that's just great. I buy my newspaper there every day. Obviously I didn't make such a good impression, then. -I'm sorry. I see a lot of people, you know? -You have beautiful hair. -Hey. I don't like being touched, OK? -I'm sorry. Actually just waiting-- -Excuse me. ---for a friend. -Hey! Hey, oww. -Sometimes I'm a little impulsive for my own good. -Oh my god. -Look who's here. -I'll have a double whiskey, please. -He looks terrible. -So when did you start drinking again? -Just now. -Uh, Nelson, we need to talk. -One more, please. -Nelson, please don't. If you're just going to get smashed, I'm going to leave. Why did you want to see me? -Well, I don't want to drag this out, but I really think we need some time apart. -Yeah. There's something I have to tell you. -What? -You look beautiful tonight. -Oh, Nelson. -I'm drowning. That's what. I'm drowning. I can't tell when you're serious anymore. Well, I'm serious when I say I love you. -You know, Nelson, you can't possibly know what love is. -Hey. What you doing? -Oh, just playing around. Working on something. -Yeah? Hey. You [inaudible]? -No. Uh, he's Ivan. -There you go, boy. -What we got going? That was him, yeah? -Alleyway killer. -Hold on, now. If he's the killer, why would he come to a police precinct? And then why does he have it on tape? -I don't know. A lot of unanswered questions. -I'll tell you one thing. I've seen this guy somewhere before. -Yeah? -Yeah. I can't remember where, but I know I've seen him somewhere-- sometime before the alley. -Hmm. Well, I'm going to take this to the press. They'll have his face on the front page by morning. -Oh no you're not. If you do that, he's going to go underground. -What are you talking about, man? Somebody out there has seen this guy. We could save a life. -Yeah. We could lose one, too. -How? -That's what happened to my daughter's killer. He saw his fucking face in the paper and he disappeared. I'm not going to let that happen again. You understand? -Yeah, man. But this is not your daughter's killer, all right? You said so yourself. Now you've got to let this go, Haynes. We've got to get this out there. -All right, man. If we're going to play God, I'll give you one more dead lady. And then that picture goes public. It has to. -If there's going to be any more victims, let it be me. -Boo. -God. How did you get in here? -Where there's a will there's a way. Nelson, I came to apologize. -For what? -We had an agreement and I betrayed your trust. It was for you, Nelson-- I mean the story. -I understand. -Thank you. -I'm ready. You can ask me anything. -I'm going to record this. -Do you like being a journalist, Nelson? -Yeah, I do. -You're a people person, aren't you? -I am, too. I think that's why we get along so well. -Talk. -Well, aren't you going to ask me any questions? -Tell me about the first one. -I was 17. -And how old was she? -35. And how did it happen? -We were making love. She found me amusing. -And you didn't like that? -No. I didn't like that. -But you enjoyed killing her. -There's a moment when you look into her eyes and the last bit of breath leaves her body. -How does that make you feel? -Like a god. Like a god. -And that feeling makes you want to kill again. -Well, there's no rush. The hunt is as important as the kill. -What do you feel when it's all over? -Euphoria. -Do you feel depressed? -No. -Do you ever feel any shame? -No. Never. -Do you have any feelings for the victims? -Love. I loved every one of them. -Ah. How many women have you killed? -How many women have you make love to? -Jesus. Jesus. -Why are you judging me? -I'm not. -Did you judge those other people you wrote about? -No. -Then why are you judging me? -I'm trying to understand you. -What you understand is only what you see. You look down on me, and you see a fool. You look up at me, and you see a god. Look straight into my eyes and you will see yourself. Put your shoes on. -OK. -Let's go, Nelson. Let's go. What's taking so long? -Where are we going? -There's someone I'd like you to meet-- an old friend of mine. -Why? -Perhaps this person will enlighten you and you'll understand where this is all going. -Yeah. Where what is all going? -The story, Nelson. The story. -Knock on the door. Go ahead. -Stefan, darling, you're early. Come on in. How about your friend? Have we met? -No. -You look familiar. What's your name? -Nelson. -Meet Eric. -Eric. Nice to meet you. -Nelson. What a cute name. Why don't you sit down and make yourself comfortable. Would you like a drink, Nelson, or don't you drink? -Yes. Yes, I don't drink. And no, uh, I don't need a drink. -Well, if you don't mind, I'm going to have one. Did you see that? Isn't this the girl I saw you with? -Yes. Poor girl. -Stefan, tell me you had nothing to do with it. -Eric. -Whew. I feel better. Well, I suppose you don't talk much either, do you? Is this the one that you told me about? -Told him what? -What'd he tell you about me? -Nothing. -I think I know what this little party needs. I'll just be a minute. -Isn't this cozy? This is a new experience for me too. -OK. -Ahh. [laugh] [claps] Nelson, meet Erica. -Now, isn't this better? -Hello, Erica. -Ah, you have to forgive him, Erica. Nelson here is somewhat of a novice. -Oh. Oh, come on. Loosen up. Look. Why don't you just sit and watch and then join in when you feel like it? Would that be OK, Stefan? -Absolutely. Isn't she special? What she lacks in quality she makes up for in convenience. -What does he mean? -You said you didn't do men. -But take a look, Nelson. Does this look like a man to you? -[inaudible]. Get out of here. -What are you going to do? -I said get out of here. -Ah. -No! -Ah! -Don't you move. Don't you move. Shut your mouth, bitch. Don't you move. -OK. -Let's do this. You want to write a story? Look here! -Ah! -No. No. -Give me your hand and let's do this. -No. -Let's do this together. Don't you let me down. Come on. Give me you hand. -No! -One, two-- -Stop it. -[cackles] [groans] [groans] -A small cassette, a collection of gay conversations. They're all in the same club, no clue as to which club. Got a partial print, but not enough for the computer to find a match. Any luck on that picture yet? -Nope. -That's good. Oh. There's, uh-- there's one knife homicide tonight. A transvestite. The knife work was sloppy. Forensics think there were two people involved on account of the fact that there was a little fight after the killing. -[laugh] -One left through the window, the other just walked right out the front door. -Ahh. -We gotta get that picture out, Haynes. -Is God going back on his word? Don't I have one dead lady left? -No, man. I can't do it. The next thing it's going to be us on the front fucking page. -OK. -Are you listening, man? -Uh huh. MALE SPEAKER: Officer. -Yeah. Now I know where I saw him before-- in a magazine article about a year ago. That guy got busted for being drunk and disorderly, a couple of times. About a week later, he wrote an article about it. He was pretty hard on the department. He said that we were, uh, cruel and insensitive to a medical condition. He wanted to, uh, know what it was like to be a drunk, so he became one. That's the guy I saw in the alleyway. He had a small tape recorder with him. -So what he'd do now? -Nothing. -Haynes. -We just want to talk to him for a little while. -Yeah. I bet he did something weird, right? -What are you doing, man? We don't have a warrant. Anything we turn over is going to be inadmissible. -What makes you say that? -Well, I saw him the other night. He was wearing a dress. -A dress? [laugh] -Yeah. I swear. A black one. With the long sleeves, lace, and sequins. It was very nice. -Really? -I guess it's better than coming home drunk every night. Right? -Yeah. -Yeah. I put a stop to that. He used to come home at 3:00 AM in the morning singing at the top of his lungs and peeing all over the stairs. Can you imagine? -I'd rather not. -Yeah. Oh. Oh. Here it is. -You got it? Terrific. -You just making up your own rules now? That's how we doing this? -Go back to the car and get a donut. -Fuck you, man. -He's new. -Ahh. -Scoot over to the precinct. About an hour. All right. Check this out. You know that transvestite that got knifed last night? Forensics only found one set of prints on a broken bottle-- Nelson Keece. -No kidding. -Yeah. What now, Snoop Doggy Dog? -That guy starts writing about alcoholics, and then he becomes one. He starts writing about transvestites, he puts on a dress. Now he's written about serial killers. -Yeah? -Look. I got the girlfriend's, uh, phone number. Let's call her up, find out where she's at, and get our surveillance team on it. You know, I need a dictaphone. -Dictaphone? -Yeah. -Oh. -You got them donuts? -Yeah. -I hope you like jelly. -I hate jelly. -Yeah, but eat it anyway. -Hey. -Hi. How's it going? -Ah, good. I'm hungry. I'd like a hot dog. -OK. Everything? -That'd be great. All right. -Here you go. -Thanks. -Oh. Napkin. Perfect. Thanks. -Bye. -Whoa. -Oh, I-- oh, I'm so sorry. -It was my fault. -Oh, I'm embarrassed. -Let me get you another hot dog. -No. No. That's not necessary. -I insist. -Extra ketchup and mustard, right? Judging from my jacket, that's how you like it. Here you go. -Thanks. -Thank you. -You've got everything? -Well, I have to go. -All right. Be careful. -Mr. Keece, are you there? It's me, Mrs. Morris. -Mrs. Morris. -Oh, hello. -Hi. Have you seen anyone in my apartment? -The police. -Oh, great. -What have you done, Mr. Keece? -I haven't done anything. -Well, you must have done something because everybody's looking for you. -Well, that proves it, then. -Well, why don't you just tell them the truth? -I don't think it would make a difference at this point. -Honesty is the best policy. -I appreciate that. Juliette? I don't know where to begin. What I do know is that I love you more than anything on this earth. I know I've let you down. I know I've hurt you. I know I've been a failure. One thing is had I gone to the picnic, this wouldn't have happened. I'm sorry for all this. I'm going to find him. I have to do one right thing before this is all over. I'm sending you this tape in case I never see you again. I know now I should have written a story called "The World Through the Eyes of Juliette." It's a beautiful world, which one dark cloud over it. OK. JULIETTE (ON RECORDING): Hi. Leave a message for Nelson or Juliette. -Nelson, it's me. It's me. Pick up the phone. It's very much in your interest to talk to me. -Stefan. I'm glad you called. -How are you? -I'm fine. How do you feel? -Disappointed. -You weren't supposed to kill anyone. You should have been square with me. I might have surprised you. -Still. You did change the plan, Nelson. I wasn't the one who brought along that nasty old gun. -I'm just learning how to do this, and I want to play again. Cut me some slack, Stefan. Stefan! -I'm here. -Where are you? -Close to your heart. -Why don't you come up and talk to me about it? -Oh, come on, Nelson. The cops are looking for you, not me. Besides, . Last night marked the end of our relationship. We now have a beginning and a middle to your story. All you need is the end. -We've never finished the interview. -That's because you're a failure, Nelson. You lack the courage of your own convictions, unlike me. I'm a finisher. -There's still something missing from the beginning, Stefan. That woman who laughed at you, the first woman you killed? She found you amusing. Please tell me why she found you amusing. -This interview is over. -So how does the story end? -Like it always does-- with a murder. Have you another victim in mind yet? -Listen to the tape again-- the one in your machine. In the end, the voice is all you'll have left. JULIETTE (ON RECORDING): Hi. Leave a message for Nelson or Juliette. -Oh, god. Juliette. Come on. God. -You got one, huh? -That's right. You know how hard it is to find one of those things? -Where's the batteries? -I don't know. -It says right on the box, "batteries not included." -Oh. My bad. You want me to go get some batteries? -Why don't you take a look around back? I'll keep an eye on the warehouse. -All right. Cool. -Now there's a nice lady. Oh, shit. That's not a lady. That was Keece. -[whistles] Cab! Cab! Taxi! KEECE (ON TAPE): How many women have you killed? STEFAN (ON TAPE): How many women have you made love to? -Haynes. Haynes, talk to me. You there? Hey. I know you're not asleep. Ah! Uh, hey. This is Laroue. Haynes is dead. Uh, I need immediate backup over at 111 Mission Street. Repeat-- officer down. Send me some backup. -Hi. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. You remember me? You dropped these at the hot dogs stand. -Thank you. How did you know I was here? -Well, that's the bizarre part. I live right down the street and I saw you come in here a while ago. -Oh. That's lucky for me. -No. The luck was all mine. -Thank you. -My name is Stefan. This is great. I've never seen anything like this before. -You know what? Actually, I was just getting ready to leave. Oh, were you? -Excuse me. -Excuse me. -Costumatic. -Juliette. -Nelson? -Are you alone? -What? -Listen to me. Are you alone? Nelson, please. Not now. -The killer is coming for you. -What? Who? -The killer is coming. Stefan. He's coming for you. Please, honey. Believe me this time. -Oh. Oh, I see. -Is he there? -Uh, mhm. -Get out of there. I'm on my way. -OK. What do you want? -Nelso didn't tell you? We're writing a book together. -Really? What's it about? -The pursuit of happiness. -Ah! -Oh. Ahh. Ahh! -Juliette. Oh, Juliette. Romeo's here. Come out. Come on, Juliette. This is the end of the story. We can't let Nelson down. Is that you, Juliette? Where are you? Juliette! -Ah! -There you are. [laugh] -Ah! -Pick up the knife. Come on.
