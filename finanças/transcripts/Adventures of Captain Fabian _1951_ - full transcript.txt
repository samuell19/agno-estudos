Do you think I will stay with her? Did you think I I'd marry you? What's wrong with that? It wouldn't have been worse for you. I would have helped you. Leah! My family's blood is older than yours. One of these days I'm going to buy one big house in st. Charles. - I know that because I feel it. - Yes I believe you. - I see the future, George. - Right.

Don't worry, my dear. Everything will be fine. Open the door. Open the door, in the name of the law! This is Philippe the butler and servant of Mrs. Wintrop. And what else happened, Mr. Brissac? When I went in to check the lights, I thought it was strange to have so many lights on... - ... without the Wintrop family. - Yes? When I walked in the door, saw the body there and Lea Mariotte was sitting next to him. Someone else was present, Mr. Brissac? No, when I entered the house, she was alone.

I went to the Wintrop family home, just to put an end to that shameful party. Yes, you are known for your high moral standards. I feel offended, sir. Just because I'm your uncle means I'm an idiot! The whole town knows you like it of that woman, Lea Mariotte. Please, Uncle Henry, don't tremble much. Think of your heart. Leave my heart! Incompetent idiot. can't help it a scandal? And you hope that may happen to me... well i still can change it. Please, Uncle Henry, listen to me. I give you my word... ... that never again I will cause problems. After all, I'm getting married and then... ... The lies of Lea Mariotte won't bother us anymore. Good. But more an error... ... whether or not there are lies, it's done. - You understand? - Yes sir. Be careful not to forget. "Port of New Orleans." On the port side! Dock! Dock! - Arlington! - Yes? - Towel. - Yes sir. Have you prepared my city clothes? - Yes sir. - Good. How are you? Watch out for the waves. Captain Fabian... felix i'm happy to see him again. How is life with Brissac family? It's not the same thing, Cap. Fabian. It's not the same. It's not the same as when you and your father... We better not talk about it anymore. By the way, Felix... ... my father's name is still there. I would really appreciate... - ... if you took it off. - Yes of course. I hope you don't think mine is unfair stay with the Brissac family? - I needed a job. - Of course I don't think so. After all, I work for them too. And I will keep working for them to pay... ... all debts. As I know the Brissac family, it will take long time. What do you think? Careful, Michael. Please be careful when receiving goods. And watch out for Emile too. - He's really smart, you know? - Thank you, Felix. I'll be careful. Read about the trial by Lea Mariotte! -Michael! - Hi! Fabian, glad to see you again! Welcome back! Look, princess, I brought you a Parisian thing. How beautiful! - You like? - Yes. Until later. Fabian! Good to see you again! Mrs. Pierrot! you are getting prettier every time I arrive at the port. Here's what I brought you. Captain Fabian. Never forget me. You rascal. How could I forget a face as beautiful as yours? Now bring a bottle of wine, drink one glass according to our tradition. - Hurry up. - Yes, I will bring the best wine. Sir. Emile, from all people. How long have you been in port this time? Not a lot. It is strictly professional. Enough to get some more money from the Brissac family. - So you will stay here for a while. - It might be. But you don't know how I am insistent when I want something. Watch out, Miguel. they the stole and killed him... ... your father... ... maybe the same thing happen to you. I just docked for ten minutes, and this is the second warning. Read about the trial by Lea Mariotte! boy give me a newspaper. Thank you sir. Read about the trial by Lea Mariotte! this is a good example for you. They're going to hang that girl because the Brissac family wants to get rid of her. Keep reading, I have others things to do. Emile, stop squirming. How do you think I'm going to read my paper if you keep squirming? Please Cap. Fabian, need to talk to you. Mr. Brissac does not allow employees attend... - ... such a tavern. - What's up with this tavern? Relax and feel good. How are my friends? the Brissac family? They are very nervous. - About the trial. - What do they have to do... ... with the trial? Nothing, captain. Nothing. Nothing. What you want? Do you have the goods for the next trip, captain? Do not. Not yet. Why? Brissac has something to offer me? No... It's a personal matter. It's something I do. It's a little more delicate. I'm very delicate also. You see, from a political point of view, with all this talk about the civil war... ... I'm supportive with the South. But there's tons of gunpowder, which unfortunately... ... I have to send them to the northern port. I understand. you sympathize with the South, but the profit is in the North. - Well, if you don't want to do that... - Sit down. Listen, Emile. My ship goes to everyone the places. East West, South North... ... for a price. - I'll take care of it, Captain. - First of all, I want to know something. Why the Brissac family are you involved in this? She is not involved. No, she is not involved. - No way. I assure you, Captain. - He is well. For my part, you and your gunpowder can rot. But I'll tell you one thing, believe me. If someone to freak out... ... goodbye Emile. I'll pay whatever. Half profit if necessary. - But I have to deliver the goods. - I asked you something. Do you remember? Why? what does this girl mean for you? Nothing. If the Brissac family is interested in her, I am also interested. Then? He is well. I'll tell you. I will tell you everything that know. But not here. Judge, I found the dead on the hall floor... ...of the mansion. There are no doubts. - That the accused killed him! - Objection. The witness takes conclusions. I ask the Court to call your attention. Objection rejected. Continues. She was home alone with the murdered man. That's all, Commissioner Germano. The witness is yours. Commissioner Germain, are you sure that there was no one in the house? Yes sir. - What makes you so sure of that? - I checked the house. - There was no one there. - This is a lie! - You know very well who was there! - Silence in the court! Continues. Who asked you to go to Wintrop family home? Someone passed by, heard the noise and informed me. - He was a stranger. - A stranger? Yes sir. I never I saw him in my life. was just a sailor passing. Why don't you tell true, liar? - Tell him that George... - Bailiff... - ... make that girl shut up. - Do not touch me. Please, you need to control yourself. - I'm doing my best to help her. - For sure. Where is George Brissac? Why isn't he here? Mr. Sanderson, if not control your reverse... ... The court will have to take measures in this regard. Please continue. You can withdraw Commissioner Germain. Judge, the defense has no more questions. you heard all testimonies, Judge. In my opinion, this young Mariotte is a dangerous assassin. I request the penalty of death. You can't hang me! You can not! Please God, me help. Help me. Save my life, just this once. I will only live to pay the Brissac family. Please I beg you. The solemn verdict of this Court is... - Wait a minute, judge. - What is it? Are you in a hurry to give a verdict. This process is just beginning. Sir, what do you mean by this outrageous interruption? I'm glad you brought That's out there, judge. Because this case will have to be judged again. - This is a courtroom. - That's right, Judge Brissac. And a court. I will remember of that if you too. you are a member of the barrier? No, judge, the only barrier that I know is to continue. But I can get some lawyers respectable now, if you like. do you have something to do with the reverse? No, judge. Not at that time. So what's your interest in this case? Justice, judge. It seems to me that there something very rare in this court. You defy the Tribunal. I will fine you at $100. Go ahead, judge. How far should I go to please the Brissac family? Sir, what do you mean? I'm not implying anything, I accuse. evidence and witnesses have been removed... ... for this girl to be hanged quickly and conveniently. Quiet. Lord, you have proof conclusive or not... ... to contest the allegations of murder against the accused? I'm ready to testify under oath. May I suggest that we do a break, judge? Of course if Captain Fabian know something... You can be sure that I I know something. The court will pause. - Sit down, Captain. Fabian. - No thank you. I'm fine, judge. Sir... ... I warn you that if you get lost your time in court... ... there will be serious repercussions. Clear. There are some serious allegations against this young woman. Your behavior at court it was a little threatening. Was? We'll see. First, the murder weapon. A heavy chandelier belonging to the employer. Wrong. It was a heavy cane, owned by George Brissac. May I continue? Who called the Commissioner German? A passing stranger. An unidentified sailor. Wrong again. I will identify it for you. This passing stranger it was George Brissac. I suspect it's yours nephew, judge. He was in the house actually in the same room, the night Philippe was murdered. Do you have any proof? Let's summarize the process and find out. After all the evidence presented at the trial... ... to clear the girl now... - ... it's impossible. - Listen to me, judge. you might be able to hang this girl. But I guarantee one thing, the name Brissac will be involved in this. I know too much. - Excuse me a little. - Of course, consult. There is no jury and we have new evidence. It won't look very good in the reports. Listen to me judge, I want to suggest to you one thing. Why don't you put that girl in custody? With me, if that doesn't bother you. Or do you want to continue the process? - I agree. - Excellent. As a favor, I'll make sure that he doesn't talk. My closest friends are the Brissac family. According to the presentation of new convincing evidence... ... in favor of this young woman, the accusations displayed are cancelled. - You forgot something. - Sir? Give me the $100. You are ready? Lea Mariotte won. Isn't it great? Bravo, Capt. Fabian. This is the first time the family Brissac is defeated. Who are you? This is my Aunt Jezebel. We've always been together. - Just the two of you. - It's more than just company. Aunt Jezebel's presence reminds me of my ancestors. Hello madam. I'm happy in meeting him. You were predestined. Night after night, I dreamed of a tall young captain, very handsome, with dark skin and blue eyes who walks like a king and who approaches me and whispers in a seductive voice: "Oh, Jezebel..." - Do not say. - I need to say more? Was it him or not? Sometimes the devil appears when you least expect it. Smells like smoke, I better go Go away! You're a coward! You don't know if it's the devil! Jezebel, look, it's the devil. The devil. Beware of the devil, or he will take you. No, please! It can't be! Why did you summon the devil? I like to walk in public with a gentleman. I've never been with one. Are you a snob? Because I like the which is better? I'm waiting for live in St. Charles. St. Charles? Why? I want to be on the same level of the Brissac family. So I can spit in your eyes. It's a worthy ambition, but I'll tell you one thing. You will not walk in St. Charles to dress like this. Come on. I have a reputation to keep in this city. Hello. - Good day sir. - Good Morning. I would like to buy some clothes, please. dress the lady head to toe. Yes sir. I know how to choose clothes. You go like my appearance. you don't care about please me, dear. To be honest, I'm not really attracted to you. You lie. I can tell by the way men look at me. Honey, I've seen women all around the world. All shapes, sizes and colors. None of them seemed special to me. So why are you doing this to me? Because I have a heart of gold. And a lot of money. If Jezebel were younger, you would have appreciated it. I am sure. choose some clothes for her too. Here, aunt. Try this. See you at the Pierrot Tavern. With purse and luggage. How much is it worth? Are you saying you want buy the Pierrot tavern? You are drunk, Captain Fabian. I? I never drank alcohol in my life. I never touched the glass. How much do you want in the tavern? I have tell you, I was offered $4,000. I'm going to ask you for $5,000. $5,000... you can take it all until 17:00? I can go now, my dear captain. I always said you were perfect knight. For a sailor, of course. But why? Why? Because I like your face, honey. I have a weakness. - At 17:00 - Yes. Welcome. In between. Welcome to the living room, "ma'am". How am I? Like a lady? It's a woman's dress. It's easier for you to do good things than doing them. After all, who wants to be a lady, when can be Lea Mariotte? Jezebel, put your luggage on the chair. - Do you want something to drink? - Ladies don't drink. - He is well. I drink a brandy. - That's better. Waiter, bring us some cognac glasses. Look this? It's my name on it. Mrs. Pierrot is gone. She was kind to help you, to make you feel comfortable. - Does that mean she's my tavern? - Is all yours. The location, the furniture... ... to the bar. Captain Fabian... in honor of the new owner from the Pierrot Tavern. I will drink for it. you will come visit us On occasion? - It might be. - This place is not bad. At least to begin with. - Health. - Hang on. It costs $1. - What? - One dollar. Prices have gone up since the last time you came here. Forget. You are mine invited this time. - Your thanks are touching. - Thanks? Nobody offers anything for free. - And nobody knows that better than me. - Serious? Serious. you bought me this tavern. Then... ... what you want? maybe you don't have nothing I want. Not? So why do you bought this tavern? I wouldn't bother thereby. I think so too I don't know. let's say it was an impulse. I don't need help now. I will have the best of this world. I can anyway. And how can I. This tavern is mine. That's what he says here. - How much did it cost you? - That's my business. And you know what? It'll cost you dinner... ... tonight. See you soon... ...see you in about an hour. You are an idiot, Lea. I would know how to treat such a man. I know what I am doing. - Is it too late? - It won't take long. - Sir... - Hi. Does it have anything to do with this company, Captain Fabian? I have a deal with you. $5,000, for be exact. That's what I paid for a little gift for Lea Mariotte. And I would like your money back. Man why should I pay for your philanthropic instincts? Of course, she's a very nice girl. attractive and I'm sure... This walking stick looks good. It wasn't with that stick that you used to kill Philippe? Or did you burn that one? I said $5,000. Cash. You are crazy. You're talking nonsense. What would you say if you explained to a Judge what I was looking for... ... at the Wintrop family home at night in which Philippe was murdered? You see, I know everything. I was that mysterious stranger who called the commissioner. - This is a lie. - How do you know? Because it's not true. It's a lie. Yes, you're right. It's a lie. Because you were the one who called to the commissioner, wasn't it? Come on, Brissac. We waste time and time means money. Do you want us to work this out or do you want a arrest warrant in your name? I accept the offer, Captain. But you are wrong. After all, a scandal it did no one any good. you seem to be able to provoke one. Also, I did a lot business in the past and I hope we do in the future. If you want it, you better change your accounting. you are hurting me years ago. I hope no one know this. - I know I can trust you. - Of course you can trust me. - I must. - I think there's $5,000 in here. I think yes. I do not need any more count them. Coming from a gentleman like you... Don't you bother knocking on the door when you enter a lady's room? Not if I'm welcome. - You are always very confident. - Do you want me to leave? I'm not canceling invitations. But you came a little early for dinner. I don't waste time if no need. I know. You are a impulse man. Exactly. In addition, I will give you good news. Tell me. Look. Did you win the lottery? Yes, in a way. A ticket with the name by George Brissac. He was very kind to return my money for your place. Money... I like to win and I like to spend it. Since George Brissac who paid... ... I should thank you. I get paid for it. You earn money as a pirate. I hope that now that you are one lady, don't ask me... ... to treat her like a lady. Right. This tavern is just the beginning. From here I will go up to John Charles Street. The whole street? St. charles... is far away from here. I know. But I'm honest and I'm telling the truth. I am different from all women that you've ever known. I'm starting to believe you. All Mariotte family ancestors I was told what to do. Did they tell you to kill Philippe? Philip was crazy. He attacked me. I had to defend myself. You had a little help, remember? Yes, you helped me. Thanks. That sounds pretty formal. Is weird. This watch seems to me very familiar. Aunt Jezebel stole from you when I came from court. It's like a child. Does not support shiny objects. So I forgot to return it for you. - Oh, you forgot! - It's a beautiful watch. I could keep it on bedside table. And every tick will help me to think of you. On here... Madam. I'm happy that you thinks I'm an idiot. Thanks. Do you know anything? You are not that stupid. And you don't have to pretend to be. I don't even intend to. "Mrs. Pierrot." "Lea Tavern." Jezebel, Peter Von Haden has arrived. A friend of George Brissac. I'll talk to him. I have an idea. - What do you want to do? - I'll tell you later. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi Peter. - Hello, Lea. - Hi. - Hello, Leah. I just left George Brissac. Do you know that he's getting married next week? I know. What are you going to do about this marriage? Lets do this? you talk like if it should be stopped. Barred? that was not What I meant to say. but you should have a party. We'll have a bachelor party in the tavern "Louis". Louis' tavern? Why not here? George and I are old friends. There is a problem with Captain Fabian. Fabian is gone. he will not be back up to a week from now. As for George, if you bring him here, I promise you a great party. It's a good idea. let's hold Saturday night. - Excellent. - Great. - Goodbye, Leah. - To the next. It's all great fun, gentlemen.

Let's have a drink. - How beautiful it is decorated! - It is specially decorated for you. - Is this my chair? - Yes. - Drink some wine. - Shall I serve you, Lea? A little. You didn't drink much, George? Don't preach to me, uncle Henry already controls me enough. Yes, Uncle Henry! How is your uncle? And now he controls you when you come home... ...and who do you know, giving you permission? Nobody tells me what to do. I'm my own boss... ... and I do what says my head. How to Marry Cynthia Wintrop. Leave Cynthia out of this. She is a good woman. For sure. You deserve each other. Who knows? Maybe you are happy. - Thanks. - Good night, Bernard. Please have a drink. I would like to see how you live a tavern lady? I mean her room? - Of course, i would love. - Then bring your drink. Yes. - Are you trying to stop me? - I'll show you the way. I will miss you. I will miss you. This way. I've been thinking about you all the time, Leah. Ever. there is no woman like you! Wait, George. Hang on. - You are so Beautiful. - Let's have a drink. - A toast? - Yes. Wants to know? A toast... ... for your future wife. I am sure that you I was serious. this is a freebie farewell. It won't be goodbye, Lea. You will see. Old friends are entitled to a farewell toast? Yes. Let's do something. Come with me. - Come with me. - Where are we going? Away from these people. Come on. You can go. This is not good. That is not not good. I live here. This is my home, Lea. You cannot enter here. Where are your keys? - But Uncle Henry... - He'll never find out. He sleeps soundly. You have to get out of here. I promised Uncle Henry that I would never but I would see it. It's very dangerous. It can't happen here. I can't risk a scandal. I'm going to marry Cynthia next week and... I will stop this marriage right now. I will wake the servants and your Uncle Henry too. Please shut up. Do you think she will marry you again after that? Do you think the family will allow? - Please shut up! Shut up! - You can't marry her! - You can not do that! - Please shut up! You will not marry her, You miserable traitor! I'll scream until everyone listen! What's happening there? - Open the door! - Sure, I'll open the door for you. Now that you're here, look. No, Uncle Henry! I can explain, you will understand. I understand very well. How dare you bring this woman for this house? - Listen to me! Please listen to me. - Not! Listen me! I've been trying to make you a man for 20 years. you are just an idiot and a lunatic. I gave you chance after chance. I warned you not to stain your family name. I warned you to be careful. Your Uncle Henry will be bad with you. Get out! Both! Get out of my way. You are made one for the other. You are the same. Go away! - Before I throw you away...! - Stop! You've said enough. Stop! Twenty years, whatever you used to talk... ... and give me orders. Twenty years ago I shuddered in front of you. You, the man with the money! The influential man! But I'm tired! This is the end! I no longer listen to your sermons. I don't have more afraid of you or your threats. - What do you think? - George! George! George! - He is dead. - I'm leaving. - I don't want to get involved in this. - Leah. Lea, you have to help me. I give you everything you want. - Is he your uncle. Your home. - Leah! - I'm just a visitor. - Leah! you had an attack in rage and killed him. Read, please. maybe there is a way to get out of it. As? If there was a place to hide the body... ... a place to bury it. He just can't go although. There would be a quest. Let's think about each answer and each explanation to fit everything. You could say he left in a hurry to Baton Rouge. We can think of details later. Of course, if you have courage... Yes. Yes, I have courage. You gave me. I can do this, Lea. I know a place... ... but it has to be fast. Rest a little. You're tired. - I finish. - Yes. You need to calm down. It's all over. You don't need to anymore worry about nothing. It's not that easy to do. - You have to help me, Lea. Help me. - I will help you. - I will help you. - I'll do my best, too. I promised you one reward and you will have it. A diamond necklace... $5,000... $10,000... Tell me, Lea. Tell me and I'll give it to you. Money, George? I didn't help you with it for the money. Do you want a house of your own, then? Yes, that's it. - A place where I can come and see you. - Yes, George, that's what I want. A home where you are welcome. I want to have a house on the street of St. Charles. In fact, your home. I will be George Brissac's wife. My wife? I want us to be close from now on forward, close as husband and wife. Yes... George Brissac's wife. - So that's what you want. - Yeah, that's what I want. Don't you think I would a good wife? Sir? Mr. Brissac? He walks out the door and stops with the noise. Just when I was sleeping, you should have come to wake me up. Since you woke me up, go get me breakfast. You did not listen to me? Bring my breakfast. Mr. George, you are you crazy? - You better go. - Go? Do you think I would? May the Lord have mercy of your soul, Mr. George. - What happened? - I'm leaving. Lea Mariotte is upstairs. - In this house. - Not! Poor Cynthia Wintrop. Her family needs to know this. And I will tell them. In between. So are you here? Is that you it was as we were told. We are here to talk to Mr. George Brissac. You will see George but with my permission. - Now I'm the mistress of this house. - You, ma'am? You have illusions, darling, if you think that someday will be able to occupy... - ...this post. - George is weak, but he's not an idiot. - Where is he? - Dad, please. George! George! Ah, here you are! You have some wonderful visitors. I can't understand why you do not believe me. Tell them, dear. It seems they doubt that we're getting married. George, that can't be true. You wouldn't hurt me, would you? I'm willing to forgive you for everything, but please tell me that we will continue... ... with wedding plans. George! He speaks. You know we have the blessing of your Uncle Henry. Tell her. Yes it's true. I'm going to marry Lea. I'm sure you did something terrible with him. I do not know what is... ... but George, I can only tell you... ... come to your senses and I wait for you. Don't expect too much, my dear. It would be a shame to spoil your beautiful dress. Yes... Mariotte's blood made you the best of all, my dear. You do not need to be afraid of your own people, Leah. Not a Mariotte yet stole a Mariotte. We are all like fingers of one hand. The dead and the living are the same. How could I be afraid of my peers? That's right, you don't have to be afraid of your peers. Not even the dead. Not even the recent deaths. Now you have to try to calm down. It's all over. You don't need to anymore worry about nothing... ... Mrs. George Brissac. What are you talking? What are you talking? It does not matter anymore. Not matters more, Lea. There will be no more questions or answers. I need to tell you something, Lea. I have to keep mine public image. I don't have to ask apologies to anyone. I opened a bank account in your name. If you are reasonable, you will everything you want. No, George. I just want forget all that. Let's have one normal life. - And maybe... - A child... ... like you? Before that happens... ... I'll kill you. Fool! Fabian! So you're not congratulating me? Maybe I should congratulate her for breaking your neck. Mrs. George Brissac. Let me have a good look at you, beautiful New Orleans. I said. I already told you what I'm going to do, I will arrive at St. Charles. It's not about what you've done, it's about how you did it. you waited until I left, right? - You have no rights over me. - Not? Nobody. Now you have it What you want. St. Charles and the family Brissac. How can I say what I wanted. I just know I was dissatisfied. - Maybe I am now. - It might be. I wonder... What? How did you get that Brissac if I married you? Is it so hard to understand? - He wanted to marry me. - Do you think anyone will believe that? I wonder what old Brissac have to say about it? He argued with George when I told him and then went to Baton Rouge. You must have put a lot pressure on George. Wonder how? You can't imagine a man who want more than Cynthia Wintrop? Yes. If you wanted me, you would take me with you. But you didn't. So the sooner I disappear of my life, better. Lea... ... I will disappear of your life now. Fabian... Fabian... Congratulations. I got what I wanted. But not really I've got nothing. don't sneak up up to me like that. you said good night for your niece? Wherever I go, everyone asks me... ... What happened with Uncle Henry. He left for Baton Rouge, didn't he? In a hurry, when I found out that you were going to marry me. They want to know when will he come back. Tell them you're worried with that too. But they want to know how he did you get there by boat or how? I've talked about this so many times that I'm tired of it. Listen... ... your uncle left home suddenly. That's all you know. He took luggage with him. I already took care of that. I burned. The problem is that nobody will believe it. He is well. Now is the time to start to be afraid that maybe something has happened to your uncle. Maybe it was stolen and dead on the way? Write to the Baton Police Rouge to make a investigation. it will take them away from New Orleans. And the grave? If the Baton Rouge police come here and start asking questions... ... and do an investigation? The servants will say nothing, because they know nothing. And if they ask us something, we will tell the same story. From the first night we were married, I couldn't look at anyone... ... straight into the eyes. How about you look at the hangman straight in the eye, George? It's like you have planned everything. - Down to the last detail. - Flatters me. The idea of killing Uncle Henry was yours. Mine? Mine? You planned this. You told me what to do. You tricked me into getting married with you too... There is no decent family in New Orleans who wants to come to this house. I'm tired of you, George. I'm tired of your whining. I think I am fed up with you. TO CAPTAIN FABIAN CHINA STAR CREW CHRISTMAS 1853 I like this ship. But he needs a woman's hand. - Is that you. - You don't think I'm a woman? Don't ask me what I think about you, I can tell you. I would like to know. You are not the one who knows what. So, do you want to go out? I don't want to throw it overboard. You are not very polite. At least I offered you a drink when you came to my house. You owe me one drink, remember? Yes, Fabian. I owe you more than that. You do not owe me anything. We're both done. Do you really feel any thing for me? If you are interested, I don't feel anything for you. That's what I used to say to myself. That I don't feel anything. And I hurt a lot of people. But to be honest, I didn't hurt no one, how I got hurt. - It's weird, isn't it? - Very strange. Tell me what do you want? Because I think you is a liar. I deserve this. I deserve everything you tell me. But now I know more than he knew. Fabian, why don't you did you take it with you? Why? Because I loved you. I've loved you. you never loved anyone beyond herself. you lied and cheated all the time, until you get what do you want. I didn't know what I wanted. But now I'm not lying to you. Look into my eyes and you will see. Lea... Leah, how can I tell you? How does a man perceive who loves a woman... ...and that he really loves her... ... even knowing that she not good for him... ... and never will be? I love you. I love you. And I think... - ... that I will always love you. - Fabian... ... Take me with you. Take me with you now, please. Are you married. You forgot? Yes. Yes, I forgot. Can I ask where you were? I went for a walk. Isn't it obvious, George? Mr. George Brissac. A worried husband. It is funny. I heard some rumors about the your uncle's disappearance. But I was hoping that a member of family to come and ask for an investigation. I'm asking for an investigation now, mr. Germain. It could have been stolen or dead, or thrown into a ditch. There are many possibilities. I want you to check everything. Yes sir. - I'll do my best. - Thanks. Sanderson, call some people. - Yes sir. - The rest... ... come with me. Let's go to the stables. Yes, sir. The commissioner has been here for several hours checking the surroundings. is probably behind from the stables now. Yes my dear. I asked the commissioner to look for my uncle. The situation reached a point where I had to take the initiative. Then... ... if he finds the tomb, you have two options. Or do you let them hold you or you try to run away. I will remain. Are you afraid? my neck never you will feel the rope. If you shut up, nothing it will happen to you. It's better to get over this once. he has no evidence against us. About the last night... let's forget about it. When you find out you don't get nothing else... ... in St. Charles, I pay you. You can say the price. You take the money and leave. But George... ... if he digs up the body? I think they're going to dig him up any time. You're an idiot. Your jacket is there. Then... ... we will have to bear the consequences together, right? a troubled husband and his devoted wife. Hey Commissioner! See what I found. It's a watch. "To Captain Michael Fabian," "of the crew of the China Star." "Christmas, 1853." that's why you it was so brave. Capt. fabian is the killer by Henry Brissac. And if we don't hurry, he'll get away. He leaves tonight. He won't leave until dawn. He now plays backgammon with his friends at the Pierrot Tavern. I warn you, Mr. Germain, who you might be in trouble. Your crew always includes assassins. Some of you will come with me. Nicolas, take the body to the morgue. We won't need you anymore and your wife, sir. Fabian will be behind the grids before an hour. For a weak man, You surprise me. Never underestimate an opponent, darling. He might have a brain. Yes, you surprised me. Your opinion doesn't matter now. then you will leave Fabian hanged? With your permission, Lea Mariotte. - Suppose I stop you. - You can't stop anything. Who do you think will play the fault this time? Dare to open your mouth and you will finish him off. You are so much more attractive when feel like you're driving. Thanks. I still haven't decided what do with you. I think I will kick you out. Perhaps. Or maybe again you won't. - Actually, I doubt it. - Serious? Are you thinking about me? kill, isn't it? What ideas do you have, George! Don't you think the same thing? That will solve everything, won't it? If not, we both think that the risk is too great. Now pour me something to drink. Christmas is upon us. - Now I'm moving. - Right. - I'm moving here... - Captain Fabian... ...you better come with me in peace. Why in peace? Don't think this is a joke, Captain Fabian. You are stuck. Why? For good company? You are accused of murder by Henry Brissac. germain, you did you drink too? Listen to me, Fabian. We do not want problems, but we are ready. If anyone moves, my men have orders to shoot. Shoot them? Are you talking about shooting? you look serious Now Germain. Your watch has just be found in the tomb by Henry Brissac, where you buried it. So that was it. that killer and a liar... Nobody moves until let's get out of here. Come on, Fabian. We better do what he tells us, boys. I don't want any of my friends be shot by a policeman light fingers. Everything will be fine. Return to the ship. It's Captain Fabian. To the side. To the side. It's Captain Fabian. When I leave here... ... I'll be happy to dust off of you with my hands. I'm just fulfilling my duty, Captain Fabian. To owe! how much you won in this business? Who made this? - Who told you to arrest me? - I obey the law. - I act according to... - Listen to me... ... even if it's the last thing you do Bring George Brissac here and charge him with murder. Captain Fabian... ... I came to tell you that I just signed a criminal complaint against you... ... accusing him of murder. - And you will be hanged. - Do not say? looks like a confession yours, isn't it? What do you mean? I mean you killed the old man Brissac, not his wife. - You are crazy? - Same? You had to marry her, No, I'd keep my mouth shut. why would you marry with her? That's what the whole town is wondering. Now they will have a Brissac response. Captain, you are not in position to threaten me. You killed my uncle. - The evidence is clear. - Serious? You are the one who will be hanged. Alone. your lovely wife will make sure of that. You will be hanged. I plan to release Cap. Fabian at dawn. - It's impossible. - Listen to me, officer, if he lets you go... - ... he will come out and laugh in front of us. - Stop saying, sir... ... will he laugh in front of us? If I was fifty determined people... ... I would hang him tonight instead highest in the public square. Listen to me, officer. I want to avenge my uncle. Can I count on you? For sure.
