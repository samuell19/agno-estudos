Yet they all fall down! Wooo! Ye! And they all fall down! Now I play the worthy enemy When I try the thing no funny me I finalise with tears in my eyes Don't wanna sacrifice Because the pressure's all on me - Fire in the jungle everybody run - Hold your fire! - I don't know tomorrow, … - Hold your fire! …I live in Babylon Honestly, when I was doing my armoury course in India, I didn't know I would use it to fight against my own people. You say what? Duba, can you read me, over? I am hurt! Duba, can you hear me, over? Duba, honestly…can you hear me? Duba, talk to me. Duba, we know where you are, we are coming to get you. Duba! Duba! Duba! Duba! Duba! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Babangida! Babangida! Are you going to be alright, Baba? Everything will be alright, Ibrahim by the grace of God. I have to go to hospital in Kontagora. When are you coming back? Your grandmother will look after you. Okay? But I will be okay… I will soon get better and return. By God's grace. Mama went to the hospital and she never returned. I am not your mother. Please look after your sister. Death has not been kind to me and my children. But death could not touch you because you are special. Be good, my son. May Allah make you great. Chief, what did he say? What did he say? He didn't say anything. Come on Chief. No one gets called into the Headmaster's office, without him saying anything. Are you going to tell me or not? Mallam Ahamadu said that he will take care of - my school fees. - What did you say? You are one lucky boy. That is not a fair thing to say to a boy that has just lost his father. Your father is dead. Your mother is dead too. Your grandma treats you better than your mother. Your uncles are falling over themselves for you and now you get free education. If that is what orphans get, I want to be an orphan too. Be careful what you wish for. I thought you were already an orphan. You called my mother a whore. Did you or did you not? What is this? What have I done, Idris? You said that to my brother, we have one mother, so you said it to me. He started it first. He called my mother a... That's enough! You leave him alone. Says who? Because they call you a chief? Because the Headmaster is your father's friend? Does not make you any less of an almajiri than you are. Are you okay? You are crazy, Ibrahim. You talk to the school bully like that? Master Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida. Do you now win the vote of the teachers for head boy. You have been a popular boy since you came to the school and that has not gone unnoticed. By some miracle, you have been made the head boy of the Bida Provincial Secondary School. You will take assembly tomorrow and liaise with my secretary. You may leave. Master Babangida, being head boy is not a popularity contest. You have to make some tough decisions to take the lead. Many bloody heads have been put on the block for you so please do not let us down. I won't let you down sir, I promise. I hope you travelled well. Thanks, we did. Thanks. That's good. I called you to discuss about Ibrahim. Ibrahim? Where is the telegram you showed me? Good. Sit down there. Hmm. Now, tell us what it says. Not all of us can read the white man's language. It says that I passed the entrance examination into Nigerian Military Training College in Kaduna. What is that? Our son has been selected to join the army. Imam, we thank you for your concern in this matter. But Ibrahim has mentioned that he wanted to join the army to us before. Our answer then was no. Our answer now is "no". Ibrahim, I thought you said you wanted to build roads and bridges. Yes, I can still be an engineer in the army. I hear you. Your father wanted more for you, Ibrahim. More than just being a soldier. You can be anything you want but you are not going to be a soldier. There is more to this. The government of the Northern region will not give scholarship to any student who has refused to join the army. What? Are they forcing our children into the army? Well, yes. The Northern region needs more officers in the army to match the south. Is Abdulsalam going too? Yes, he is going. If I don't go, the government will frustrate me. Whatever he wants to do. Let him go ahead and do it. All we can do is ask Allah to look after him. Amen. Thank you. - Thank you. - It's alright. - Thank you. - It's alright. Master, buy me something Expensive to satisfy me, eh Master buy me something Expensive to satisfy me Bonsue Azikwe Bonsue ayo-ayo Bonsue Azikwe Bonsue Ayo-ayo ooo - Eh eh eh - Hello Maryam. Ibrahim? Does your brother know you are at the - disco? - What are you doing here? We are celebrating finishing our secretariat course. - Oh, nice. - These are my classmates. Congrats. Congrats, ladies. - Thank you. - Okay, I am also here with my friends. You know, we just finished, ah, military academy. And then we are also here to celebrate. - Okay, those are my friends right there. - Hi. Come over, guys. So, ladies this is Abdul-salami. Sani Abacha. Sanni Sami. - Congratulations. - And Magboro. Oh, baby, dance for me - I love you dancing for me - Dancing for me - Dancing for me. - Dancing for me. - Oh baby, dancing for me. - Dancing for me. - I love you dancing for me - Dancing for me - Oh baby, dancing for me - Dancing for me I like the night. Without the dark, we never really see the stars. Take a look at that. It's beautiful. It's nice. Is that from a poem? Hm. Poem? No, it just came out Honestly, I don't know. Yes, there were times you saw me crying They never cared to wipe off the tears coming down my face Oh, running down my face Looking for the one to bring me out But fate keeps turning me Searching for the way to see the light The break of dawn is perfect Waiting for the day that I will smile The pressure keeps pressing me But since I found hope My only companion and this time I am never going to let it go Never going to let it go See the way it shows the way to find me I am never going to give it up And yes, I found hope My only companion and this time And yes, I found hope, my only companion And this time And yes, I found hope After all, that I have been through, yeah And yes, I found hope My only companion, and this time, I am Just yesterday we announced that the Head of State, General Murtala Mohammed announced the creation of new states the states include Bauchi, Benue, Borno Imo, Niger, Ondo, and Ogun state. Attention! Your arms up! General salute! Raise arms up! Your arms up! Stand aright! We are all together. Yes. …any resistance will be met with death. You are warned. Any act of blocking of roads would be dealt with. Everyone should be calm. Please stay by your radio for further announcement. All colleges, air and seaports are closed until further notice. Curfew is imposed from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Thank you. We are all together. Sir, was that not Buka Dimka I just heard on radio, Sir? Get ready. Get your boys and go and flush him out from the federal radio corporation, Ikoyi. - Who else is involved, sir? - You will find out. Now, go. - Badamasi? - Sir? Dimka is very dangerous and ruthless. I have always warned the Head of State not to go out without security convoy. Sir. Cover your positions! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Buka? It's you Ibrahim? You are not armed, are you? I am unarmed. You wanted to do something like this and you didn't tell me Buka? Buka, you are my friend. You should have told me. Ibrahim, this is no joke, alright? I am not playing games with you. I swear, I'll kill you. That is fine. At least, I will know that I died by the hands of my friend. Knowing you will look after my wife… and my children. Why have you come here, Ibrahim? I have come to see you… …as my friend. And tell you, let us give this up now. This is not going to work. - Of course, it is going to work. - Innocent people will get hurt. Ibrahim, what do you know? These people… these people, they hate you. You are the most hated officer around here. Why, why, why don't you come and join us and be and be part of us? Look, they wanted you dead, but I… I, I saved you. I am not afraid to die. You know me. If I wanted you dead, I would have shot you from the moment you stepped into this place. Let's go. How is it going out there? You only have the radio station. You cannot execute a coup only on radio. Well, I know. He is dead. I… I shot him myself. But Gen Aguyi Ironsi, Colonel… is loyal. Mamman Rasta, …Usman Jubril, Umaru Mohammed, they are all loyal. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen. Listen, Ibrahim. Okay, this is what happens when you work without a… [Dimka breathes heavily Tell Danjuma that he… he would wriite a written amnesty for… for all my men. And, uh, If I…, then we'll talk again. …necessary filed by the tribunal. Those condemned to death by firing squad have been executed today. This includes Lt. Col B. L. Dimka, and Mr. J. E Badmus. Two of the principal actors of the attempted coup. I am tired of these bloody civilian bosses. I swear, these civilians are like children. They can't even help themselves. They are taking care of the military. So I am fine. But if this country scatters, there won't be any military here. Look, so, why don't you do something about it? Do not vote them in next time. You know why I am here, abi? Good. I can't believe this, Chief. I can't believe it. Haba, Sani, come come, just... At least, take a minute to think about it, will you? You want me to join the traitors against my own country? This is just like an express road to… to firing squad. Think - about that, too. - Sani! Sani, you and I have known ourselves too long to be playing this military honour games. The question is are we going to act to save our country? It is our duty and privilege to act. I know you have been called too many names but not coward. This is me, Sani. I cannot do this without you, my brother. Who else is involved in this? Do we expect any trouble? Maybe a few boys I do not trust. We have to send them on leave immediately. We don't want any bloodshed. Look, what we are doing is very dangerous. Any single mistake can end all of us in front of a firing squad. You are the one who is closest to the president, so you have to be the one to arrest him. We don't want him hurt. In fact we may not have to fire a single bullet. May Allah help us. So there will be no resistance from the guild of guards? I have just confirmed from Colonel Ogbeha, and he has spoken to the commander, Captain Ayanbo, so we don't expect any resistance. So, if we win, who is going to take over? Don't look at me that way. Look, I am not interested in this, I hope you understand. I have no interest, absolutely. You, are you interested? Left right, left right, left right. What about, uh, Major General Buhari? He seems to have just done very well with the Chad crisis and uh, clean. Lele, fire Lele, ulele, soldier. Fire my soldier Lele, fire. Lele, ulele, soldier Fire my soldier Lele, fire. Lele, ulele, soldier Fire my soldier Lele, fire. Lele, ulele, soldier Fire my soldier Lele, fire. Lele, ulele, soldier Fire my soldier Uh, Captain Bamidele, I am very busy. I need to go home. How may I help you? Sir, I said I should come and see you and talk about my fears. - Your fears? - There is something happening. I think… I think they want to sabotage the government. - Do you mean a coup? - Yes, sir. Who is planning it? You have gone dumb? What did you hear and from whom? Never mind, sir. I think I am mistaken. I am sorry to have disturbed you. Sir, I said I am sorry. Please, sir. Sir, please. Hello… I think the time is now or never. Hey, stop, stop right there. Stop! Fellow countrymen and women, I, Brigadier Sani Abacha of the army addressing you this morning on behalf of the Nigerian armed forces. After due consultation over this deplorable condition, I and my colleague in the armed forces have the discharge of our National role and protection and promotion of our National Interest… Okay. Okay. No trouble at all. Fine. No problem. Fine, fine. Thank you. Please, sit down. Ah, ah, You know that this is the political side that I don't like. Left to me, I will take the best. I don't care if they are all from Daura. I understand. So, ah, in that case, ah, Idiagbon will be the Chief of our Staff, Supreme Headquarters. And you will be the Chief of Army Staff. That is, uh, very fine. That is all I ever wanted to be since I joined the army anyway. I am very happy. Ah-ah Fine. In that case, I will announce it at the Council meeting this afternoon. - Okay - No problem. Sir, one more thing your excellency. Brigadier Idiagbon is my junior. How will it work? Don't worry. We will see to that. This wasn't what we agreed. I helped make this change of government happen. I know, you contributed. What have I got for it? If you are talking about your newsprint that was seized. I am not talking about newsprint. People are suffering. There is fear in the land. Apart from seizing my newsprint they retired Guso. Aliyu Muhammed is being investigated. I even heard that they wire taped his home. Who do you think is next? Me? Hmm. Don't flatter me, Kola. Why me? Because you are too smart. Because they are afraid of you. You control the armoury division. Your association with civilians like me frightens them. They will either retire you or hang a phantom coup on your neck to eliminate you. Why are you telling me this, Kola? Have you finished? Most Nigerians go through life without having the opportunity to become a hero. I believe this is our second chance. If they sent you, Kola, tell them you didn't find me. Maryam, in the military, if you hear a coup and you don't, report it, you are as guilty as the people that planned it. So… what are you going to do? General, there was a meeting? It was not a meeting. Just uh impromptu. But I was with you a few minutes ago. Why… why didn't you tell me there was an impromptu meeting? May I go in? He is busy, General. General, it is me. The Head of State couldn't be possibly too busy for me. Honestly, he is. But you can see him tomorrow or next week. Alright, Chief of Staff. Supreme Headquarters. Can the Head of State have this? Your friend, for you sir. Something is wrong. He is talking about the Abiola sting last night. He is a smart man. Which is why I say we should arrest him immediately, sir. Give me the order to arrest him. Do you know what will happen if we are wrong about this? I am not wrong, sir. I feel it. Something is not right. [Sani They are closing in on us, sir. We need to act now. On two conditions, Sani. What condition? That we live out our four years and hand over to civilians in 1990. We can't quickly rush back to civilian rule. Looking at what happened in 1979. And the second, we will not kill the Head of State or any member of his cabinet. We cannot execute a coup without killing. It is very impossible. Yes, we can, Sani. We can. I don't want the cure to be worse than the disease. Not a single bullet would be fired. Even in self-defense? If we carry out the plans strictly, we won't have to lift a single finger in self-defense. Okay. Praise be to the Allah. Haba oga He's my friend and we need some of his intelligence contacts. We just need tanks We need more than tanks. We need men. Very loyal men. They already have eyes on Gusau. They are watching him closely. Gusau already knows that. I have already spoken to him. Why?… Gusau? Sani? It is all of us or none of us. Sani, just the man I wanted to speak with. Are you not supposed to be in Mecca? Yes, tomorrow morning. What's wrong with him? Is that the way he handles pressure? By getting drunk? Pressure? Happy Eid. One more move and I will blow your head off. Hey! I said I will blow your head off. Now put your hands up. Put them up where I can see them. We cannot execute a coup without killing. It is very impossible. We can. I don't want the cure to be worse than the disease. Gusau already knows that. I have already spoken to him. Why? Gusau? He is my friend and we need someone with his intelligence. We just need tanks. We need more than tanks. Wind down. Sani? Sani? Very careless and unprofessional. That is enough evidence to land all of us in front of a firing squad. You couldn't even check your office for bugs. Or look behind you to see the man that has been following you for the past three days. I will see you at the regime exercise tomorrow. Good night, my friend. This exercise must be precise. You must be willing and ready to move within five minutes' notice. Fully kitted. Tanks fully fuelled. Your commander would tell you your designated target when the time comes. Until then, you are dismissed. Yes sir. As you can see, they are ready sir. I just hope they still will be ready by the time they know what it is we are doing. No problem. I will be in Minna. Dear Maryam, by the time you read this letter, you'll either be a widow or the first lady of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. I am sorry to put you and the kids through this. But, you're the one that will always say, that you only live once. Fellow Nigerians, when in December 1983 the former military leadership assumed the reigns of government… It's ascension was heralded in the history of this country. With the nation at the mercy of political misdirection, and on the brink of economic collapse. A new sense of hope was created in the minds of every Nigerian. Since January 1984, however, we have witnessed a systematic denigration of that hope. The principles of discussions are efficient, and cooperation has shown that the decision making process of the Supreme leading council and the Federal Resident Council were disregarded soon after the government settled down in 1984. And so it came to be that the same government which received the tumultuous welcome now became alienated from the people. We do not pretend to have all the answers to the questions which our present problems have put before our nation. And we do not intend to lead a country where individuals are under the fear of expressing themselves. The public officers, protection against false accusations Decree 4 of 1984 is hereby revoked. We recognise that the government be it civilian or military need the consent of the people to govern if it aims to reach the objective We do not intend to rule by force. Let me reiterate what we said in 1984, this generation of Nigerians, and in the future generations have no other country but Nigeria. We must all stay and serve it together God bless Nigeria. Why didn't you tell me? It was a coup. We are not supposed to tell anyone. Not even your own wife? Especially my own wife. But it is over now. Everything is fine. How is your friend? He is fine. It was a bloodless coup. Not a shot was fired. Thank you. I have been waiting for this time, hanging around the corridors of power. Watching, learning I am ready now, darling. I am going to be the best leader Nigeria ever had. Real importers cannot get Forex because import license system is corrupt and inefficient. Lack of raw materials means the industries cannot operate. They are forced to retrench their staff, therefore making the unemployment situation worse. Inflation is at 20%. Is there anything positive about this economy that we have inherited? Our trade arrears is 4.4 billion Naira. We have negative growth in GDP. Our external debt stands at 18.3 billion Naira. We have subsidies on everything. Naira is overvalued and our economy is 75% dependent on oil. How did we get here? How did things get this bad? We have written ourselves into an economic black hole. The last administration tried to get a loan from the IMF but they could not meet the conditions. Conditions? What are the conditions? Devalue the Naira. Remove all subsidies and restructure economy. We have, uh, declared economic emergency. We have banned the importation of rice and beans. We are reviewing the foreign exchange market. What uh, again, should we do to tackle this sickness instead of just symptoms? We have to renegotiate our loans with genuine creditors. Spending 44% of GDP on servicing loans is unsustainable. Remove subsidy? Privatize government companies? Devalue the Naira? Why? Do our people have the capacity to face the hardships that would come as a consequence of these measures? Make no mistake sir. A surgery to save our economy would be very painful and sacrifices would be demanded of everybody. Doctor, are you asking us to fulfil all of the IMF loan conditions and yet we are not taking any loan? I am afraid your excellency. But more borrowing is not what is required to solve the problem of already too much borrowing. The solution is Structural Adjustment Program, SAP. We have to do this ourselves, sir. We have to. - No more SAP. - We won't accept. We won't accept. No more SAP. We won't accept. No more SAP. Alhaji Aminu, could you tell me what is going on? Uhm, your Excellency, some unscrupulous elements started a rumour that an American magazine published details of your wealth. Because of that, students at UNIBEN started demonstration in Benin. This man that gave us presidency in a military government thinks we can be pacified by platitudes and lip service. Ebony magazine in the United States just published details of his wealth. - See for yourselves. - Are you serious? This is serious. This is serious. That is it folks. While he wants us to suffer under the woes of SAP, treasury for himself and his family. Dear friends, must we sit around and wait to die like cowards? No! No, no. Must we watch these cabals suck this country dry? No! - What must we do? - Fight! - What must we do? - Fight! So how come we couldn't contain the demonstration in Benin? How did it spread? My men did a very good job in controlling the raging situation with minor casualties but... Unluckily an incident in Lagos College of Education set them up in a… demonstration and soon it was tagged as, uh, uh, SAP riots. But we've arrested the... That is not enough. We must shut down the universities in question. Sani, here the Chief of Army Staff, he has to deploy soldiers on the street with immediate effect. We can't all just sit here and watch these hooligans bring Nigeria to its knees. Sir, only the university's Senate can shut the university down. Jubril, I am the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. If I say that the universities causing troubles should be shut down, then they must be shut down with immediate effect. People are hurting, your Excellency and we have to look for a way to make it easier on them. I agree to that. Sir, please give the adjustment process a human face. By doing that, we project an image of a listening and a caring government. Or a weak government that falls for cheap, criminal blackmail. But have you noticed something? There is no religious or ethnic patterns to the riot. For once, Nigerians are united behind one thing. As bad as that may sound, it gives us hope. President Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida said this at the opening of People's Bank of Nigeria in Ajegunle part of Lagos People's bank was established from the March '88 budget… …with an initial allocation of N13 million, attaining its Lagos status by the publication of Decree no 22 of 1990. Socialist crusader, Tai Solarin as its chairman. The bank is to meet the credit need of small borrowers who cannot satisfy the - stringent collateral - You made this guy, - requirement normally required - Tai Solarin, chairman of people's Bank? - By commercial banks. - Yes. He likes to scream his Marxist ideas from the outside. Let him get inside and this government and see how impossible Nigeria is. She is exactly like you, Maryam. Halima, Halima, presidential baby Halima So are you going to allow me rest. You have your four children. Two boys, two girls. I have achieved all I set out to achieve in life, thanks to Allah. So, at least if I die now, I die a happy man. You are not going anywhere. You can be alive and still be happy. You need to take care of them. Well… The two government formed and founded parties are the National Republican Convention, NRC which is a little to the right and the Social Democratic Party, SDP which is a little to the left. It should be recalled that NEC, although critical of that applied for registration as political parties, did recommend six organizations to the Armed Forces ruling council, AFRC for... - So, when… - …researcher made exaggerated claims that membership size had dropped. In another news, the Rangers International Football club of Enugu has trashed Bendel Insurance Football club of Benin by 3 goals to nil in the state's available football stadium. Darling? Darling? - Hmm-hmm? - Wake up, wake up. I hear gunshots. - I am not sure there is… - Wake up. Alpha, bravo 1. Can you read me? Over. Delta, bravo 2. Receiving, over. UK, what's… what's going on? Over. We are under attack, sir. I think it is a coup. We are holding on. I've rang Bonny Camp and Ikeja for backup. Over. Can we contain them? Over. We are trying, sir. They are many. They came with tanks. Tanks? Oh, my goodness. Tanks? Yes, sir. On behalf of the patriotic and well-meaning people of the middle belt and the southern part of this country. I, Major Gideon Orkar wish to happily inform you of the successful ousting of the dictatorial, corrupt, drug baronish evil man. Deceitful, homosexually centred prodigalistic and unpatriotic administration of General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida. We have also commenced a trial for unabated corruption, mismanagement of national economy. They had almost succeeded in subjugating the middle belt, making them voiceless and also extended the same a temporary decision to excise the following states: Sokoto, Borno, Katsina, Kano and Bauchi. UK, who are these… who are these people? I don't know. I have reached Major Biyu at the Ikeja cantonment and uh, General Sani Abacha. They are mobilizing men. Long live the true patriots of this great country of ours. May God and Allah, through his bountiful mercies bless us all. I think you should leave through the back exit. UK, you have to take my family. I am not running like a coward. Please. Darling, please go. Sir, go now. Ehn-ehn, looking at this coup plotters, I couldn't help but notice that most of them are from the middle belt and Niger Delta region. Igbo bastards. We have to reach out to these people. Maybe we can create a few new states and even local governments. You think this will have anything to... I know it would show them that we care. We can even adjust uh, national allocation formula to favour the Niger Delta even more. Ibrahim, you can't keep on bending to these people. We take our position and anyone doesn't …fall into line, we crush him. Why? No, no, Sani, haba, no. No. I was even thinking maybe we can civilianise the government. What? Civilian? How about a civilian vice president? And even civilian deputy governors. Why? That way someone like Admiral Ikomo can become a civilian vice president. With that I'm sure that they would know that our transition to civil rule is genuine. Why? Why? Sir, no. We… Get ready, successor. We are moving the Federal capital to Abuja. Yes sir. Nigeria and other responsible countries of the south region will not stand by and watch the whole of Liberia turn into one mass grave. It is in Nigeria's interest to relentlessly strive - towards the prevention - Position! Or avoidance of the deterioration - of any crisis which threatens - Aim! To jeopardise or compromise the stability, prosperity and security of the sub-region. Fire! Gentlemen, The Federal Capital Territory Decree 51, of December 12, 1991. With as from today, Lagos ceases to be the capital of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Your Excellency. Why are you doing this, Arthur? Uh, doing what your Excellency? ABN. Association for Better Nigeria. Who are the members of this association and what is your preoccupation with campaigning for me to be president for another four years? Uhm, These are Nigerians who know what is good for Nigeria and are not afraid to say it. So, another four years of IBB is good for Nigeria, right? What is the alternative, your Excellency? What is the alternative? To hand over these greedy and selfish lot? And repeat the madness of the first and second republics? You know I am one of them. I know how I got elected in 1979 and 1983. No. Since you lifted the ban on us, people like me have crawled out of the woodworks. And they are strangling this new polity. By the way, why did you unban us? I said it. I unbanned you and the old brigade, uh, because, uh, I am convinced the new breed in whose interest the ban was imposed have come of age. Wrong. You are wrong your Excellency. The looming third republic would be worse than the first two. Believe me, we are not ready. The politicians are not ready. Nigerians are not ready. But I do not have all the answers. A leader does not need to have all the answers. And everyone knows that you can do it for our dear country. Especially in this our trying times. Ah, Your Excellency. You are welcome. We haven't offered you anything yet. I am fine, Ma. Thank you. Chief Nzeribe, you are a good man and uh, I know that you have good intentions but transition program is already in full swing. And not even I can stop it now. I cannot even stop you from campaigning either. In fact, I am flattered by it. However, thanks but no thanks. Uhm, even if you arrest me, your Excellency, I will not stop the campaign. Very well, then. - Thank you for your time, sir. - Go on. Thank you. But darling, if his campaign is going to cause you trouble, why don't you stop him? Hence, I will have to stop all the Ganis, and all the Falanas, and the Ransome Kutis. And all the NGOs that are working for all the profiteers, threatening bloodbath in Lagos if I do not go. I will first have to stop all those ones before I talk about someone that is singing my praise and showing support in my favour. Our maradona has done it again. He has done it again. He has moved the election date again. Would you let that happen? - No! - Would you let that happen? No! So, I charge you all, every students to make sure that your voice is heard. To fight, to use civil disobedience as a tool. To make sure that IBB goes. Agreed? - Yes. - Agreed? - Yes. - Agreed? - Yes. - Agreed? Solidarity for ever. Solidarity for ever Solidarity for ever Your Excellency, I am not sure this postponement is necessary. Things are getting bad out there, and now you want to move the goalpost again? This is a twist too many. Tofa, let me, uh, assure you that it is not only the ABN that wants us to stay. We are well aware that part of the military hate the idea of, uh, hand over to civilians. and this will surprise you. I am just coming out from a meeting with the newly elected governors and guess what? They are also in support of us staying. So if the people for whom we are doing this do not have faith in themselves, what is the need? So, your Excellency, are we staying then? If we are, let's make our intentions clear. Instead of playing these little games. Our people are tired. "The two presidential aspirants" that could emerge at the end of the process come from the same part of the country, the far North. This is very disturbing. Considering the National composition of the country, "this is undesirable and unacceptable." Let's nullify the primaries and dissolve all the executives of the two political parties at all levels. No, Sani, that would be playing right into the hands of those that said the two parties are government parastatals. Who cares? Who cares what somebody thinks? Stop disturbing yourself about what people are saying. Let them think whatever they want to think. That's their own problem. Let's call the pro… personnel, uh… professor NEC. Let him get us the caretaker. Then I will call an emergency meeting this afternoon. We dissolve the primaries. Then NEC would decide, would bring a new way of selecting their presidential candidate. My problem is not with the system. My problem is with the people. So long as the same set of people are in charge of the nomination process, things are going to go the exact way like the past. Let's ban them. All the 23 presidential aspirants from contesting nomination of their parties. They say I want to succeed myself, so you might as well put me on that list. So they at least, know we mean business. So in that case, we just… we ban them for distorting and sabotaging the realization of our transition program. Call that meeting. Yes sir. Sir, banning them so close to the December elections would create problems. We would have to find new candidates, conclude primaries, and run elections in a matter of weeks. Is that really the only problem with the ban? I guess with the benefit of hindsight, unbanning those politicians was a very big mistake. And it would give me great pleasure to ban them all over again. But, uh, Clement, any thoughts on the matter? Well, your Excellency, decree 48 of 1991 as amended by decree 6 of 1992, clearly gives the AFRC sweeping powers. But like the chairman of NEC has said, ah, it may create serious logistical problems, uh, if we should begin to think of going that route, considering the time we have at hand. History would bear me witness that the problem is because those aspirants and those party officers have refused to play the game by the rules If timing is the only problem, then maybe we can move the date from Jan 5th to sometime in 1993. To maybe 27th August 1993. That way we have more time to clean up this mess and, uh, the handover could be on the 8th anniversary of this administration. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Uh, well. Thank you sir. Nobody cares about the afflicted living in fear amidst this cruel world When the shit hits the fan The children suffer Preachers are flying in private jets The National Assembly election has just happened. And surprisingly, it went well. Uh, SDP, have limped into the lead. With the original timetable, the National Assembly was supposed to be inaugurated, two weeks before the president comes in. That means the National Assembly would have to function under the military for that longer. Hmm. How do we work that one? Your Excellency, that would be a constitutional anomaly Uh, at best, an official diarchy. I would say… maybe you can delay the inauguration of the federal legislature say by a few months? And what would they be doing in all of these months? Well they can use the time to move around their constituencies or indeed the whole country. To see what the real problems are. If they are going to be making laws for Nigerians, they should at least move around to understand what problems Nigerians are facing. Thank you, Clement. Thank you your Excellency. Thank you Sir. Your son, when is he graduating again? Uh, next month, your Excellency. Ah, I didn't know you remembered. My head might be filled with Nigeria's problems but I know who my friends are. Thank you Sir. Thank you, your Excellency. …MKO, Kingibe, Action MKO, Kingibe SDP Progress. Abiola is the One. SDP is the party To solve our problems And make our lives better MKO, MKO, MKO. Action Abiola, Abiola, Abiola, Progress He is the one we want For a better tomorrow All rise, Justice Bassey Ita-Ikpeme presiding. Only one case listed, Ma. Association for Better Nigeria, as this is an ex-parte submission, NEC will not be represented, okay? The Association for Better Nigeria is seeking an interlocutory injunction to stop the National Electoral Commission from holding the presidential election slated for June 12, 1993 due to irregularities in corruption in the conduct of the Social Democratic Party, SDP primaries won by Chief MKO Abiola. And after examining the preliminary evidence submitted, I am convinced that the presidential election was so massively, cynically, and shamelessly rigged that any government produced at the end of this process would be without legitimacy. I am therefore compelled to grant the interlocutory injunction stopping NEC from holding the presidential election on June 12, 1993 pending the substantive hearing of the case on Monday. First to you, Clement, tell me why you cannot keep your judges in order. What is the implication of this madness? Your Excellency, Sir, as the Minister for Justice, I am not supposed to control what the judges do or how they rule. They are independent. Don't tell us rubbish. How do you solve this, eh? Mister Judge, how? The ruling is clearly against the provisions of the decree. Then if the decree is abundantly clear, then why did the judge gave the order? Why? Sir, it is not just about the decree. There is also the appeal court ruling, Yes, under the principle of the, uh precedence, high courts are supposed to follow the rulings of the higher courts. So, if that should be the case, then we pretend this never happened and proceed with the elections. Sir, it's… it's not that simple. I mean it is not that straightforward. Yes, well, we'll have to apply to have the order vacated. We cannot just go flouting or disregarding court orders like that. If the order is against the decree or what else did you call it? Then, we have no any other explanation than that the judge is showing some mischief and we just ignore her. Prof, what do you have to say? Your Excellency, I am not sure what the legal perspective is. I would leave that with my learned friend to deal with. But from an operational point of view, it would be hard. Explain. NEC has deployed all the electoral materials. The polling cards, the polling registers, the returning sheets to the states and local governments. It is my opinion that if we cancel or postpone these elections, these materials would be compromised. We would have to reprint all the materials for us to be able to conduct another election. These things would cost us time and money that we do not have right now. Your Excellency, if you ask me, I would say that we continue with these elections. Everyone is ready. Everything is ready, your Excellency. We cannot let a small group of people spoil everything we've worked for. Okay, you may take your leave. Thank you. Bloody civilians. So what will you do now? Successor! You have to be in Abuja first thing tomorrow morning. Yes, it is very urgent. Well… Let me sleep over it. We will talk about it in the morning. Darling, what's wrong? What's wrong? Look, I am tired. Just pack your things and get the kids. We are moving back to Minna in a few days. What? Why all of a sudden? I thought I had the key to Nigeria's problems but I was just deceiving myself. Everything is crumbling around me, Maryam. I can't do this anymore. And then, what? What happens to everything you spent your life working for? Your name, your legacy? Look, I don't care anymore, Okay. Of course, you do. Look me in the eye and tell me you don't care about how history remembers you. That we risked our lives and sacrificed everything for nothing. Honestly, Nigeria is just impossible. I know You are doing good. Just keep on doing your best, darling. Remember when you took over in 1985, you told me you wanted to be the best leader Nigeria ever had. We are halfway there. Just keep on doing your best. People think I do not have feelings. If only they knew how these things hurt me. Abiola is winning. He has won ten states already. With these, my greatest fears are coming true. It wasn't supposed to happen this way. We have so far received results from 14 states. Now you may be able to do the maths yourself. But NEC is not in a position to announce the final result until all the results from the thirty states are handed in. Um… It's okay. It's okay. I have court order. Prof, this fax just came in from the High Court, Abuja. Justice Daliyu Saliu has ordered us to stop announcing the result. So this is true? He says that the elections were carried out in contravention of the court order and are therefore null and void. Assemble the legal team in my office immediately. Immediately. So we appealled against the order. Admit it Prof. That was a wrong move. Yes, and since you have started disregarding court orders, you should have disregarded this too. If we all make mistakes the first time, must we always make the same mistakes again? But sir, what we are... I beg your pardon, Barrister. I do not have absolute power over these things. You know! I report directly to the council… Gentlemen, gentlemen we are all on the same side here. Your Excellency, the problem here is that we have court orders from everywhere. Lagos, Benin, Ibadan, everywhere. Compelling NEC to release the results. And how many of these court orders am I supposed to obey? We have only announced 14 states with Abiola in commanding lead. The judiciary is making a nonsense of all our efforts. Excuse me! Tempers are high everywhere. But if we cannot keep our heads, what do we expect from the streets? That will be all for now, gentlemen. I will contact you after the NDSC has met to decide our next line of action. So, darling, what are you going to do? Darling? I don't know. I don't know really. But they likely are going to kill me. They are going to kill me if I announce the President-elect as the winner. They are going to kill all of us. Who are they? I don't know. We just have to stop everything. Everything. Thank you for seeing me, Snni. Honestly, you are one of us. Why is Ibrahim doing this to me? I have worked hard for this. I have earned this victory. Kola, sit down. It is complicated. How complicated can it be? I have won, everybody knows this. Kola, calm down. I will find a way to talk to Ibrahim. This election result has been a problem from the onset. I have won. Let him just allow the result. Kola, be very careful. You know, Ibrahim is a very smart man. Don't put yourself into trouble. Support me, I will find a way and give you back your mandate. Abort! Abort! Abort! Your Excellency, there is an intel. A report. And we must turn around. Your Excellency, Sir? Your Excellency? Your Excellency? Your Excellency. What is wrong. The press secretary to the vice president, Mr Nduka Irabor, this afternoon, released a press statement purporting to annul the June 12 presidential election wildly rumoured to have been won by the SDP flagbearer, Bashorun MKO Abiola. In the statement, the Federal Government also dissolved the NEC, The National Electoral Commission, repealing all decrees pertaining to the transition to the civilian rule Although the letter, undated, unsigned and not written on any official letter headed paper. Yet, the government has not released any statement denying it. All efforts to speak with Prof. Humphrey Nwosu, the chairman of the NEC has proven abortive. This development if proven to be true will throw the whole transition process into great turmoil. This is Uloma Ugoji, reporting for NTA news. Solidarity forever Solidarity forever Solidarity forever We shall always fight for our right Solidarity - On June 12, we stand. - Yes! Unless your reinstate June 12, Nigeria will scatter. - Yes! - We will help you scatter Nigeria. Yes! You shall not steal our mandate from us. - Yes! - This is only one mandate. Yes! And no one, no one will steal it from us. Boys, boys, boys. I need to talk to you. I have just done something that would haunt me for the rest of my life. What did you do, father? And why did you do it? I don't know. You will just have to wait until things calm down, Kola. Just wait. Just give… just give it some time. How... How did this happen, sir? Ah, why are you trying to ruin your legacy in the name of loyalty... Barrister… Barrister stop. Please don't judge me. Don't judge me. I can only do as much as one person. There are certain aspects of military politics, you can never understand. And I don't expect you to. Most military leaders in my position will just lay down the laws and they will beat people into line. But I chose a different path. All I wanted to do was to rule the people with their consent. With their love. Now I think that is my greatest mistake. Hmm… I should not apologise for trying to be a nice person. But, I do hope that history would be kind to us all. Barrister. June 12! When do we want it? - Now! - What do we want? - June 12. - When do we want it? - Now! - What do we want? - June 12. - When do we want it? Now! - What do we want? - June 12. - When do we want it? - Now! - What do we want? - June 12. - When do we want it? - Now! - What do we want? - June 12. - When do we want it? - Now! - What do we want? - June 12. - When do we want it? - Now! How are you? This is anger like we've never seen before. This is different. International pressure is building. I've stopped taking calls. From the Americans, to the British… even the Russians. Let's go home, darling. The rioters will soon be tired. And then we can. Sometimes, it is more bravery to walk away than to stand and fight. You can't go on like this. These children need their father. I need you alive too. For their sake, and for my sake too. - I... - Shhhh! You can't win every battle. 8 years is enough. Let's go home. And one day, Nigerians would wish you stayed longer. I am telling the truth. This nonsense must be stopped. I really thought Nigerians were incapable of this type of prolonged anger. We must stand our grounds. Whatever happens, the election remains cancelled. Period. And then what? This impasse? This crazy vacuum where madness rings? - So what do you want to do? - Come on, Sani. Open your eyes, honestly. We were talking to the party leaders and elected governors about fresh elections. We had their support, only for them to come this morning to say that the people are tired of elections. Me too, I am tired of elections. Then if that should be the case, let's do what we have discussed. Sani, can't you see what's going on out there? We've messed up. You've messed up. I told you what to do but you couldn't listen. You want to play the smart statesman but impossible Nigerians. Go on. This is the result. So, it is… it is now my fault? Yes. Was that what they told you in the meeting in Lagos? Oh, you heard about our meeting in Lagos? I hear everything. Then if you hear everything, then you know it was to save your neck again. Someone has to talk to the people behind the protest. Fellow Nigerians, following lengthy deliberations with my service chiefs, I offered as my own personal sacrifice to voluntarily step aside as President and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. We have put in our best. We have had sleepless nights, there have been periods of joy, there have been periods of sadness and frustration. In all these, our countrymen have showed understanding. Winner o, o, o Winner. We have won o. Winner We will win again Winner o, o, o. Winner Winner, o, o, o, Winner Winner, o, o, o, Winner We have won again o We do not control the process, Sani The process controls us. It has a life of it's own. By God, election is going to happen on June 12 Both Abiola and Tofa will cancel themselves out That still needs to happen and we continue with our plans. What if it doesn't happen? - What? - What if it doesn't happen? Please tell me We call Oga NEC He will make it happen. It will work. It must work. Tofa is not the most popular person from the north and Abiola... They don't want Abiola to be president. They say he lacks the morals to be Commander-in-Chief Yes, both of them are not good enough But both of them are my friends. Why don't I just walk away from all of these and say you take over? This is a military government oga The troops will never be loyal until there is a coup. So why don't you plan a coup against me? Haba oga I can never do that. You cannot plan a coup against me, I cannot walk away. So, what happens now? Tofa will win from the north and Abiola will win from the south None of them will meet the conditions, There you bring in the interim national government Then leave everything to me. That's all.
