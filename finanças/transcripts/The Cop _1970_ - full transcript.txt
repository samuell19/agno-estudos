Enough, Lupo. This was only a warning. Come! The Mandarin again? Look, Roger, you must give up! I created this joint alone, and it's a clean business. I don't want to hear about their drugs. I don't want to deal coke to sixteen year-old kids. Hello? Yeah, I'd like to speak to Tavernier. Yes, to Mr. Tavernier himself. Roger Dassa here. He's out? Well, listen, can you relay a message to Mr. Tavernier? Roger Dassa tells him to fuck off. My answer is no, and always will be no! We've been called about a fist fight in the back alley. Didn't hear a thing. Did you fall? - As you may see. - In barbed wire? Incredible! You guessed the whole thing. If by any chance you'd like to fill a complaint... Against whom? Well, you never know. You're aware of where to ask, hm? - Do you think he understood? - It would almost be better if he did. Come on! Can you picture me working with the cops? The cops and the Mandarin are the same thing, anyway. He's protected. It's the same everywhere. In Dakar, the goons who sunk our boat have not been arrested, because they paid off the police. That was a long time ago. Come on, we've nothing more to do here. What with your arm, don't you want me to drive you home? I'll be alright. Roger! - Yes, Dan? - No, nothing. Bye. Bye. - Helene... - Good morning, Dan. - Helene... - We've got nothing to say to each other. I'm absolutely not responsible for what happened. Every time Roger had... trouble, you were there. And now he's dead. What happened was not my fault. If I'm guilty of anything, it's of not having been there, as you put it. He's got a fractured skull, his plexus was crushed, and his limbs fractured in seven places. - Anything else? - Don't you think it's enough? I was hoping for... who knows? A bullet, a knife wound. Roger Dassa didn't commit suicide anymore than he accidentally fell, doctor. I'm sorry, inspector. - Are you looking for someone? - Yes. - Man, woman, child? - Man. - A relative? - A friend. - Do you have a description? - Oh, yes... 1,75 m. 80 kg. Chestnut hair. And a foul temper. Favenin! - Still bathing in formaldehyde? - Yeah, a sad story. I'm sure there was foul play but, of course, there's no evidence. - As usual. - As usual... Sometimes I wonder if everybody's not praying to God for the lack of evidence. - This is a rotten city. - Not worse than anywhere else. Do you think so? I'm glad to see you again. How's Jany? And what about your two kids? They must be growing up. They sure are... Christine and you must come and have dinner with us. Jany will cook a chili con carne, her specialty. I remember that last time she burned it. Yes, come in. Some gentlemen are waiting downstairs. Yes. I'll join them in no time. Gentlemen? My name is Georgy. Georgy Pretty Smile. And this is Lupo... And this is Tony. Helene Dassa. Oh? I didn't know that Roger was a married man. He wasn't married. He had a sister. Please allow me to offer you my condolences for the cruel loss that you just suffered, and which affects me too. You're a very well-bred murderer. Your pain is leading you astray, I'm afraid. You do work for Mr. Tavernier, don't you? - Yes, I represent him, indeed. - Let's go straight to the point, then. What do you want? That's quite simple. I want to see Roger Dassa's successor. I'm aware of all my brother's business. I and I alone, am entitled to make a decision. Roger Dassa said no. Well, it's still no. You're a thick-headed family. Yes. And now you can ask your stooges to walk you to the door. Stooges... Well, listen, stooges. Take a good look around. This is a trick of the eye. In truth, you are not here, and never have been. Should some bad guys, coming from who knows where, decide to annoy this lady. What would they do, in your opinion? Think they might smash everything. Exactly... They smash everything. Like this. No more bottles! No more piano! No more counter! No more drapes! The coming of the Vandals! The end of the world! This is Waterloo. This is the Berezina! This is Armageddon! They do the same silly things every Saturday. I'm coming to help you, Jany. Come on! Bedtime! Quick. Oh, that's right. You never drink alcohol. Do you know what they did to him? They transferred him for unruly behaviour. It's repellent. Oh, let's forget this. It's an opportunity for us to see each other again. Like in the good old days. What about telling me what's bothering you? This is what's bothering me. - Oh, Mr. Tavernier? - The Mandarin. Import-export in Indochina. He was involved in the piaster traffic but, fortunately for him, a general was in it too. He's now in real estate. He's got friends everywhere, in the public as well as the private sectors. This is the "heads" side. - What about tails? - Extortion. Blackmail. Drug trafficking. Underage prostitution. And no evidence? Never a single piece of evidence or a single witness. His stooges are well-known, you can find them behind every dirty trick, but he himself, is never involved. And since he's got friends in high places, we are politely required to mind our own business, bums, strikers, hippies and students. But I'd like to show you something anyway. - Right now? - Right now. ...about cooperation that our government wants to establish, will welcome a large exchange of ideas. That's why, as protractor of the new law in project about new forms of criminality, I want to clearly stress today that each and every breach of the law will be severely repressed. Most citizens in this country want order, and we're going to bring it to them tirelessly... Down with fascism! Those who are screaming at the back of the room should not talk about fascism, repression or dictatorship. The bloke there is Pretty Smile, one of the Mandarin's men. Absolutely! I insist that they don't know the meaning of the words. Can you picture us taking orders from Pretty Smile? Well, now that the Mandarin is going into politics, that's what will happen if he's elected. Just thinking about it makes me shiver. ...and this project should inspire all those who... I'll wander in the room for a while. - Good evening, Barnero. - Good evening, sir. Control yourself, officer. You're wearing your thoughts on your face. There are accomplices of the Mandarin here, sir. Can you imagine him elected a deputy of the majority in the next election? One, he's not candidate, not yet. Two, keep those thoughts to yourself, Barnero. Granted, not everyone likes Mr. Tavernier, but a policeman has no business dabbling in politics. Politics, sir? I know what you're thinking. Don't say it. You want to succeed, Barnero? I've got two kids, sir. Then you should work with them in mind. Nobody's asking you to right all of the wrongs in the world. Of course, boss. Trust an old cop on this, Barnero, the police are made to serve society as it may be, not to change it. - The police? The doctor? - I phoned only you, Mr. Dan. - What about her? - Upstairs. Call doctor Gibault right now! Tell him to come immediately, - but not here, my place. - Alright, sir. Hello, Viletti? I need you. Don't worry. Nothing's broken. The sedative I gave her will make her sleep. - Her arm? - Nothing's broken, I tell you. In a few days, she won't even feel it. - Well, goodbye. - Goodbye, doctor. - And thanks. Here. - No, no, no. Take it. Goodbye, doc. - Hi, Viletti. - Hi, Dan. - Helene? - She's OK. Sleeping. - Is it serious? - No. Not that much. Lots of bruises mostly. Look, Viletti, I called you because of the Mandarin. You want to punish him? No, I'm going to kill him. I thought you gave that up. Roger and now Helene. It's too much. The best place to see the Mandarin is his gaming circle. I thought about it. Every Saturday night, he goes there around 2 A.M. to collect the winnings. Then he goes away with his two bodyguards. Is next Saturday night OK with you? Yes, it is. Is your daddy here? He's up there, repairing his motorcycle. So, tell me, are you getting in shape for the race? - Hi! - Hi! It's been a while! You want to come in? Have a drink? Go in. - Is Colette OK? - She out shopping. Yeah, she's OK. Well, her health is not that great. Sit down. What do you want to drink? A Martini? The kid looks fine. As you can see, yeah. And my grandmother is OK too, thanks. What are you now? A social worker? I need an alibi. - When? - Saturday night. A card game. A card game around two A.M. The three of us. Three? Yes. You, me and Viletti. If Viletti is involved, this must be serious. Yes... Tell me, Roger Dassa... not an accident? No. Alright, let's rather say a card game with the four of us. I'll drag Colette in it, it will look more real. - As you wish. - I don't like being insulted. - Look... - No, you look... You weren't Roger Dassa's only friend. Alright? Sure... Bye... I went to Dassa's club. What happened there? A hurricane? A hurricane... Your friend's club has been demolished and you don't care? My friend is dead, you know. Therefore his club... They told me the sister was the new director. Well, if they told you... She wasn't at the funeral. Why? You'll have to ask her. I definitely will, as soon as I find her. I've got quite a lot of questions to ask her. I know. Here, the police have special ways, they don't interrogate criminals, but their victims. So what? What would you have achieved by attending? Was it crowded? No. Not really... Cesar. The club's employees. A bunch of pals. A police inspector. An inspector? When a night club owner is thrown down from the top of a parking lot a few hours after having been beaten by killers, everybody think it's weird. Even the police. Then let the police do their work. Once, we were so close to each other, Helene. The last time we were close... Was in an airport We always seem to meet in airports. So you still ground your cigarettes half-smoked. You never go to the very end. I stop when I've had enough. You never knew how to do this. You've always gone too far. But this time... - This time... - Stop, Dan. Don't try to avenge Roger, it's useless. Let the police do their job. The police... Are you going to stay this time? Till the end? For God's sake! Surely a clean police force can exist. I've actually been thinking of going away, you know. I'm fed-up! The people hate us, and sometimes I don't really blame them. Police work is not what I thought it would be. What did you think? Just what you taught me. But before I leave, I want to do one thing, I want to nail the bastard. When I say the Mandarin is depriving me of my sleep, I mean it literally. Yes, I sometimes get up, get out, take the car and cruise around the town. Do you too think I'm wasting my time? No. In order to do his job, a cop has to search trashcans. What's the time? - Five to two. - Let's go... I'm jamming a spike under the door, so we'll find it open when we come back up. It's just his practice, he doesn't live here. It's all offices here, no one will come before Monday morning. I spent hours watching this door. Look at them, croupiers. Corsican thugs. Do they gamble large sums here? You bet... And the Mandarin himself comes to fetch the winnings on Saturday nights. Isn't he taking chances? Or careful. You'll see in a moment. Before the shark comes out, we have a little ballet of remorse. What if they walk down the stairs? No chance. They never change their habits. They always take the elevator. Look out... The first load were the body guards. The second will be the Mandarin and his accountant. Second load. - Suede, Dan. - Suede, Viletti. Watch this! What's up? Bugger! The spike is gone! Who was it? Stop! Give me your guns! We must have a little chat with those guys upstairs. You go up a single step and I shoot. - Are you out of your mind? - My aim is not out of anything. They're getting away! I think those guys are working for the good of Mankind. I don't want you to hurt them. Give me your guns already! You have no right! No right? Have you heard of self-defense? You've got a gun in your hand, and so do I. The only thing is, I've taken an oath. This is disgusting. And the best is yet to come. Get out of here! Now! Maybe we should investigate the others now. They're coming up! One minute earlier, and we would have had them. You're not going to let them get away with it, are you? I'd love to do just that. You're wrong. They're all the same. Come on! We're getting there. We'll be safe up there. Halt! Police! Halt or I shoot! Don't shoot. For God's sake, don't shoot! Come up! Come up! Did you see it? He shot me. Don't talk. I aimed for the sky, but he shot me anyway. Don't talk. Why... why? His personal belongings... What should I do with them? What about Lupo and Pretty Smile? What did you do with them? We kept them for an hour, then the Chief said we should let them go. Now, Favenin, really! Excuse me, I'll call you back in a few moments. Yes, yes, dreadful business... Where are Pretty Smile and Lupo? Oh, come on, Favenin, we can only use them as witnesses. I can understand your being impatient. I am too, but you said so yourself. Pretty Smile and Lupo were down in the street when the shots were fired. So they couldn't possibly have killed Mr. Tavernier. I don't give a damn about Mr. Tavernier. I piss on his grave, sir. You're upset. And rightly so. - Barnero's death... - You make me want to puke, sir. What's the hell's got into you, Favenin? Are you forgetting whom you're talking to? Are you forgetting, that you're just an insignificant, low grade police officer, who was transferred here because of his lack of discipline? I'd rather blame the shock you suffered for your attitude. And we all share the same shock here. We're all supporting you, Favenin, what more do you want? Put me in charge of the case. Come on, Favenin, it's impossible. Barnero was an honest cop. Call him naive if you wish. But he was also my friend and nobody will prevent me from getting the bloke who shot him. I want to be fully and totally in charge of the investigation, or... - Or? - Or I'll go public with everything that Barnero told me. There are four of five reporters downstairs, it will make them good copy. Personally, I've got nothing to fear, Favenin. If irregularities were committed in our services, I'll soon put things back in order. Is it yes or no, sir? You're mistaken about me, Favenin, and I'll prove it to you right now. I've got a policy of pushing forward the most dedicated officers, and just like you, I want to avenge Barnero. Your very aggression is making you the right man for the case. It's yours. This is Ramses the 2nd. He's going to die. - I just heard on the radio. - I had to do it, Helene. I was wrong to think that you changed. I never promised anything. Helene! When I saw you at the airport, I understood all that we wasted. So, with time, I could have forgotten about Roger. Not forgiven, but forgotten. But what they did to you, I couldn't let them get away with it. I just couldn't. Are you going to stay, this time? I answered you already. It will last what it will last. No visitors. We're mourning. Police. Is Pretty Smile here? - Who else? - Lupo and me. Good. You can go. What the devil... You've got some nerve. Do you have a warrant? Lupo asked you if you have a warrant. I don't. You're trespassing, then. Yes, I am. So it's legal for us to throw you out, copper. What about a banco? Are you going to cover it with your salary? No, I couldn't afford to. I'm talking about another kind of banco. A more interesting banco with no dough. What do you want? I want the name that the Mandarin whispered to you yesterday, before he died. Fat chance. Yesterday night, your friend refused our collaboration, and now that he's dead by his own fault, you come to us for help? The name. That's our little secret. - You two share it? - We do. So? The name? As you wish. I'm not demanding, I'm just asking. Do you know what this is? It's a silencer. What about the gun? - It looks like mine. - Yes. We took it from you last night. It's very simple. When I reach five, I shoot. Just like baccarat. Where did you graduate? Chicago? You've got five seconds to give me a name. You can forget about your five seconds. I said no and I meant no. Well, it's no, then. And I seem to recall that you said no, twice. See if he's dead. Catch! Well, what about that name? It's Rover. Dan Rover. It's Dan Rover. And the other one? I don't know. The Mandarin said only one name. I swear! Walk over there. Sit down. Take your handkerchief. Unfold it on the table, with care. Put the bullets back into the clip. Put the clip back in the gun. Put the whole thing on the handkerchief. The silencer too. Now sit down on the other chair. I suppose that you understand? Pretty Smile has two bullets in his belly. The gun that fired them is in my pocket, including your fingerprints all over the handle, the silencer, and even the bullets. I'm giving you a break, Lupo. If nobody finds the corpse, I won't find the gun. What if Rover learns that l’ve reported him? I'll find Rover. What if he finds you? I must take the chance. At least, take me to somewhere safe. A minor charge of some kind... I'll think about it. If you behave nicely, you might go to jail. Well... If all cops worked your way... Dan! Don't go out! I'm afraid. You read the papers, didn't you? The police don't know who did it. What about that man who knows you? The one they call Pretty Smile? I know where to find him. Even if he guessed that I was responsible, he won't talk. Don't go. I'm afraid. Look... If I'm not back in two hours, call Raymond Aulnay, he's a friend. You'll find his number in my phone book on my desk. But you won't have to, I'll be back in two hours. Ciao. Don't make a fuss. Come this way. Where is he? I had him locked upstairs, in the archives room. It's quieter. - Did he confess? - Not yet. - He will... - Try to avoid... Oh, well, do as you please! - Well? - Nothing. We're breaking our fists on him. You're a brave man. Really... But what's the use? Do you think I'm going to hit you? It would be useless. They tried that already. The others are interested in finding the Mandarin's murderer anyway. Because of his death, they'll have a hard time. Also, since you've not been officially arrested, they can keep you that way for two weeks. I, for one, would rather congratulate the Mandarin's murderer. What I'm interested in is finding the bastard who killed Barnero. So listen, Rover. There were two of you on the roof the other night. The first one shot Barnero, the second one told him not to shoot, and he was the one I shot in the leg. That was you. Unfortunately, I'm interested in the other one. The one who killed Barnero. And I still don't know who he is. So, here's the deal... There are two ways of explaining things. The first solution is simple. Dan Rover, esquire, was arrested on false grounds, and police officer Favenin can testify to it, because he doesn't recognize Dan Rover as one of the two men he chased on the rooftops. Police officer Favenin being under oath, his testimony is indestructible. In other words, you're free to go and there's nothing more to it. The second solution is different. Police officer Favenin, still under an oath, let's not forget, recognizes without a doubt, Dan Rover, as one of the two men he chased on the rooftops, and what's more, he's sure that Dan Rover was the one who shot Barnero while his accomplice shouted to him not to shoot. Now, this is rather ugly. A cop killing. For Dan Rover, it means a life sentence, or worse. Do you see what I mean? Your nose in the din. Between the two testimonies of police officer Favenin, both false, I think Dan Rover would be stupid to choose the bad one. It's simple. Either you give me the name of the guy who killed Barnero or you take the plunge for him. Answer me... Answer me, for God's sake! So, is it a yes? Friendship is a beautiful thing. Fetch a tape recorder! You made your choice. Answer it. Yes? A colleague from Domestic Affairs. He's got something about Dan Rover. Interested? I'll take it. Yes? Why, this is very interesting. Thank you. Viletti... Ring a bell? They tell me you've been seen together a lot, lately. If it was him, I'm sure to recognize him, anyway. I've seen his sillouette for only two or three seconds but... I've got him here. As clear as a photograph. Are you thirsty? You must not believe what people say, you know. This is not the Gestapo. Now that we're finished, I'd like to hear the sound of your voice. So, this time, I'm asking are you thirsty? Yes or no? Yes. Well, you see, I've managed to make you confess something, after all. - Did he confess? - I'll leave the procedure to you. Ah, Firmin! Do you have my man? He's in the small office next door. I need another small favour. Viletti! Do you know him? Francois Viletti. Don't try to double-cross me. Is he a friend of Rover's? I don't want any trouble with that kind of guy. You might be in deeper trouble if the word goes out that you killed Pretty Smile. Rover and Viletti were in Africa together. Roger Dassa was with them. But now you must protect me. If Viletti learns that I told on him, I'm as good as dead. You must keep your word. Last month, during the elections, remember when the billposters were gunned down? Well, that was Pretty Smile and I. Get up. Go and sit down there. Take down his statement. Last month, the shooting during the elections... I was responsible. Wasn't there two of them? His accomplice is Georges Duval, a. k. a. Pretty Smile. We'll have to put out a warrant. Take care of this one first. And be nice to him, he was really helpful. Alright, let's start Go! Is it true that a guy named Dan Rover is in the house? Rover? The cop killer! Do you know him? - You won’t put me in the same cell, will you? - Certainly not. He's in preventive detention until his case goes to court, so he's got a cell all to himself. Come on now. Rover! To the visiting room, your lawyer is there. Come on, hurry up! Good morning, Rover. How are you? - I'm fine. - Your spirits are high? Well, I studied your case closely, and I must say - that the police officer's testimony is... - Have you seen Aulnay? The preparation of the trial will begin next week... Have you seen Raymond Aulnay? Yes, I plan to go and see him tomorrow. Good. Here's what you must tell him. I want him to stay at all times with the person I told him about. - Is that all? - That's all. - Would you like some more meat? - No, thanks. You don't eat anything. You don't say anything. What's up? Christine... I want to nail the bastard who killed Barnero. And I will. Don't. I'll go. I'm sorry. I hope you were not having dinner. No problem. Come in. - I found your Viletti. - And? I asked him a few questions. He's a tough character. Yes, Rover wasn't easy either. But Viletti has an alibi. That night he was playing cards in the company of a Raymond Aulnay and his wife. - Was the alibi confirmed? - Yes. Who's this Raymond Aulnay? He selling on the marketplaces. He's a street peddler of sorts. We think he might be handling stolen goods a bit, but nothing big. He's introduced in the anarchist circles. The intelligence services have a file about him, but he never was convicted of anything. His testimony is valid. - What's his address? - I've got it here. Are you going out now? Just long enough to verify something. I'll be back in a couple of hours. We're past the legal time. But I'll come with you, if you wish. No, no, out of the question. Go home, you must be exhausted. - Police officer Favenin. - Again? Some of your people already came this afternoon. Where is your wife? - I beg your pardon? - I said, where is your wife? - In the hospital. - In the hospital? Since yesterday. You can check if you don't believe me. Laennec Room, bed number 12, a lung engorgement. 40°C fever. - Do you know a Viletti? - Yes. You were playing cards last Saturday night. Yes, I already answered that question. Were you here? Yes, but it's past 8 PM. Do you have a warrant? No. You're right, it's getting late. So we'll try to save a little time. Funny, isn't it? Some people are playing cards, while cops are getting killed on the rooftops. - What exactly do you want? - Just to get things right. At the exact time when Viletti was playing cards with you and your wife, he was also walking on a building roof and killing a mate of mine, a cop called Barnero. - This is not possible, since... - Since he was playing cards with you. As you can see, we always come back to the same point. I'm going to ask you to be a little more specific. For instance, up to how many points did you play? - One thousand points... - Repeat that! One thous... One thousand points, you say? Let's count them again, together. Daddy! Take a good look, and never forget this. That's a cop for you. Bastard. Barnero had kids too. - And Viletti killed him. - Viletti? He was playing card with me. Up to a thousand points. A thousand points! Lower your arm! Put your hat back on your head. Now turn and face me. All the way. You're not very curious. Do you know who I am? - A cop. - That's right. You all look alike. Maybe so. But I didn't come to arrest you. I came to kill you. And what do you expect from me? Fear? You're wasting your time. I've been waiting for death for many years. Well, your waiting is over. You talk too much. When you come to kill, you must kill! Possibly, but I feel like talking... Inspector Barnero was my friend. He died stupidly on a roof. We all die the way we can. And almost always stupidly. You've got too simplistic a philosophy, Viletti. I say Barnero's killer is a bastard. Maybe the guy who killed your friend Barnero reacted on instinct. He had been shot at. Barnero fired towards the sky. The other one didn't know that, so he defended himself. You didn't think about that, did you? No. Barnero's wife and their three kids didn't either. All in all, maybe your friend Barnero was the real bastard. When a man chooses a job which exposes him to violent death, he doesn't have the right to a wife and kids. He must accept a solitary life. Like you do? Like I do. Come on, let's get it over with. What do you want me to do? To confess? To deny? To try and overpower you? Self defense... Would that alleviate your conscience? Firing at an unarmed man is not easy. You've never killed an unarmed man? Your friend Barnero was armed. If you kill me tonight, it will be murder. Well, let it be murder then. Viletti, murdered by Pretty Smile in order to avenge the Mandarin? Absurd! If you want to help Dan, you've got to do what he asks of you. You've got to watch Favenin. To know at any moment where he is, what he does, where he goes... I'll know it. And don't try to contact Dan. I only talk to him myself, through his lawyer. What good will all this do? Dan is in jail, because of Favenin's false testimony. I think Dan wants to send him the bill himself, and I think he's right. Have you read about Viletti's death in the papers? Those bastards say that he was framed by the police, so the Chief is of course, furious. - Where is he? - Downstairs, in the shooting range. Do you know what they say about the Viletti case? I know. You've got my official report An excellent report it is. Sir, in your opinion, who killed Viletti? Pretty Smile killed Viletti. Motive, revenge. That's what it says in your report and I countersigned it. We won’t look any further. And what about Barnero? Who killed Barnero? Well... This is your police, sir. Barnero died because he believed in a clean police force. I know one thing, police work is dirty, and it has to be done dirtily. I can't hear you, Favenin. You need a rest, and to do a lot of thinking. The reasonable thing, would be for you, to take a vacation. It's useless, sir. Here's my resignation. For God's sake, Favenin! You blame everybody for Barnero's death, but you alone were with him on the rooftops. I don't know what's eating you. We'll discuss this resignation when you come back. Take a vacation. As for this letter, I don't even want to know what was in it. Rover! To the visiting room! Your lawyer is here. Come on, come on, put your ass in gear! - What is this? - The list of extras, chief. - Die, you bastard! - There it goes again! Don't you dare move from here, you two! I'm going to pacify the wild animals. You're lucky to be here. Anywhere else, I'd have killed you for what you did to Helene. I did nothing. I swear! Now, bastard, either you talk or you die. - Come on! Explain, already! - Explain what? I don't have anything to explain. Don't shout! Don't shout! - What happened with Viletti? - Viletti? You read the paper, didn't you? - Where is Pretty Smile? - I don't know. I know nothing. - Nothing? Nothing? - I know nothing. Where is Pretty Smile? Pretty Smile, he's... he's at the bottom of a pool. In a pool? You offed him? - You offed him? - No! Favenin did! The cop? He did kill Pretty Smile. I was there. And now he just killed Viletti. He's going to incriminate you as much as he can. Since his pal's death, he's mad as a hatter! The conference is over. Get out of here, you two. Now! What happened to you? I slipped, chief. I fell on the sink. Did you, now? And what were you talking about when you slipped? About the list of extras, chief. It's incomplete. You just add the missing names, I'll sign it later. Oh, come on, it's not a tragedy, is it? Come on, Rover, to the visiting room, on the double! Move it! I saw your friend Raymond Aulnay. He told me to tell you this, contact is made, all is ready. Aside from that, I saw the judge... Counselor, I'd like you to go and see Raymond Aulnay this very afternoon. Just tell him, tomorrow night. - Tomorrow night? Nothing more? - Nothing more. Alright. Now, about what the judge told me... I trust you entirely. Do your best. Well... I hope to see you again soon. - You know where to find me. - Yes. - Good morning. - Hey, good morning. He's always with you? Oh, yes, we've got no choice. His mother will stay in the hospital for another week. - Are you talking about me? - No, I was speaking of my son. What about the cop? Still on holiday? Yes. Here's the map. He lives here, in a house on the riverside. There's an inn nearby. Okay. - Is he always alone? - Yes. He sent his wife in the country. Visiting her parents, I think. What does he do? Nothing. I watch him from the inn's terrace. He's walking around, doing nothing. This morning, I almost considered going to see him, to talk to him, to try and make him understand. A cop is a cop and he's the worst of them all. Dan... he knows about Viletti. He wants to kill Favenin. If Dan kills Favenin, it will really be the end. Yeah... Dan will escape tonight. We mustn't lose our nerve now, we must help him. Don't touch that, sir... Mr. Director, one of the inmates says he's got information about Dan Rover. He says he knows where Rover is, sir! Do you know where Dan Rover is? Dan Rover has only one thought, to kill inspector Favenin. The first thing he'll do will be look for Favenin. Do you know where Favenin is having his holiday? Of course, sir. Then alert the local police station now! Take a look. The old mill, rebuilt as an inn. Favenin's house. The river. I must tell you about Helene, she's a nervous wreck. And she decided to go to Favenin. So? So, I tried to prevent her, but she's now convinced that by talking to him, she might convince Favenin to alter his testimony. Did you bring what I asked for? Try to understand. - She's afraid for you. - Give it to me. Maybe she's right. Thanks for all that you did. Be careful, okay? I am Helene Dassa. I come to ask you to save Dan Rover. Come in. Why do you want to hurt him so? You know perfectly well that he didn't kill your friend. You avenged Barnero, just as Dan avenged my brother. But you've got a card with the French flag on it, which allows you to carry a gun, and you're under an oath. You're not an ordinary criminal, Mr. Police Officer. A policeman's task is not a noble task. A functioning body does produce waste but gets rid of it properly. As for every disposal task, the police task must be accomplished swiftly, cleanly, discreetly. In this case, there was far too much movement and smell. That's why I decided to put an end to it permanently. In what way? For me, the only important thing is to see Dan proven innocent of the policeman's murder. I just wrote a letter to the District Attorney. It contains everything that happened since Barnero's death. Everything? Everything- Including my resignation, which I plan to give myself, to whom it concerns. Stop! Hey, you, there! Stay where you are! Stop or we shoot! What's going on? Police officer Favenin. Nobody shoot without my order! Watch out, Favenin! Rover is here to kill you. Rover! Listen to me! Rover! This is Favenin speaking. Helene Dassa is here. Throw down your weapon, Rover. You warned them, didn't you? You or him? He said he would make everything right. - That he would help us. - Help us? A cop? Dan. He was right. Cops are bastards! You're a bastard, inspector Favenin. Holding Helene Dassa won't be necessary. I take full responsibility for it. Why did she act that way? She's got her reasons. Do you want to know them? This is a letter addressed to the District Attorney. I'll take this letter, Favenin. Are you sure you want to do this? Do you realize that the whole force will be discredited through you? I won't help you in the slightest way, Favenin. Well... Good bye. See that police officer Favenin stays at the disposal of the General Inspection of the Services. They'll come tomorrow.
