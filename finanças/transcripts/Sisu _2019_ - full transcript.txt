[Jesse] What's the purpose of being fit? What's the purpose of pushing yourself? I think the greatest thing that fitness provides us besides being well balanced, is that, that ability to transcend situations. When you get to go outside and slow down, and you're engaged in something greater than yourself, and you're in this really inspiring landscape, it invites that conversation. How do I practice this place of mindfulness? How do I practice being present? And, and why does that make my one hour with my family more valuable than an hour with my family when I'm not present? It's just trying to find... in little seasons, what's the season of the day? There are these few hours, is this little season something I've got to dedicate to my family? How do I take that and make it like a full rich experience? How, you know, how do I make sure I'm getting the most out of that? I think it's more about just saying, well, you know, this is the time for this, so I've got to be here. [traffic purrs past] -[Erik] Put them on too tight, you'll never get them off. -[Scott] Yeah, I wasn't sure. It felt like we stripped the whole lot. [Erik] Hold on, you want to move that stuff? No, okay. -Hold it for you? -Say, it looks to me the checklist is easier-- Well, we'll work on our team building skills here. [woman calls out] [background chattering] [pedal crank whirs] Yeah, looks a little low for you. -You think so? -Uh, maybe not. I mean, depends on which way I tilt my pelvis. If I lean over a little bit more, and if I sit upright, right? Like-- [man] Aren't you going to be going back into it? Yeah, ask Eve, she does fittings, so. [Erik] Here, let me try. Let me fix the clips too, once we get in here. [background chatter] Um, the pedals came with cleats. -Yeah-- -So, if you got a pair of shoes, I-- we're set. This is, this is perfect. Well, if this works for you, this works for you. Yeah, 16 to 5. This is basically like almost being one, right? Um... and everyone, I think, can see already, it's a massive amount of logistics, right? We're talking a ton of crap. So, we-- from this point forward, yeah, I think it's going to be-- We need to start to think about assigned roles for-- Assigned roles, things are going to be-- you know, it's going to be a little consuming. I think the training is going to be the least of our issues. So, we've already gone around, we've already had our vote. Everyone in this room is either in or is at least willing to be, at the very least, be an alternate. Um, so right now our team roster verbally is Katie, Erik, Scott, yes? Yeah. Casey, Kevin, Matt, Krissa and myself. -So, Scott, you're going to get back on your bike? -Yep. -Good. -Whoo-hoo. Hammer's our tenth. Despite being in Colorado, she's going to train along with us, going to try to join us FaceTime or Skype -in most of our key meetings. -[Hammer on phone] How do I get my picture in there? Wait. -Hold on. -[Hammer] Can you see me? Oh. -[all] Hey, hammer. -[woman] There she is! No, now it's showing your chest, Erik. -Erik, you're showing-- -[Casey] You look pretty. -You're showing your chest. -Oh, showing my chest. [laughs] Sorry. I just-- What's that? [Hammer] You suck at this, I'm looking at the floor! [all laughing] [lively exercise music] -[Scott] What is this? -You haven't seen the spin video? -[man] We've got a double one. -Do it harder, harder! Faster, go, go! [laughs] Our goal is to make people suffer. Yeah. [gentle music] [Scott] Balance in life is something I've always really strived for, and it's the reason why I moved to Maine quite honestly, 'cause it was-- my life was completely out of balance. I was spending probably 80, 90 hours a week, generally on average, working week in week out, weekends. And my wife, Diana, I mean, basically said, you know, "You're starting to be a fairly miserable person to be around often. You're always on edge." Sometimes those conversations sort of jolt you back awake, 'cause you get so into your sort of daily routine, and you don't really see how it's impacting you on a daily basis. So, in, uh, 2003, I decided, uh, that I was going to follow a dream I've had of owning a cafe. [Kevin] I met Scott through the cafe and then met Erik, and then I guess we were just cycling together. And then Scott was telling me about, "Hey, you know, there's this cool new place sort of work out." But it was pretty underground. You had to know somebody to get-- Jesse was trying to build not just a gym but a, a community. [Matt] Coming from, you know, a fairly intellectual type of career, coming here and being a stay at home Dad, I didn't, you know, I didn't have that. And so, being part of the gym has been just, almost a lifesaver for me in terms of having this community of people to do things with. [Hammer] Jesse's TruStrength group was the first time I worked out as a group, as a team, and had that camaraderie. It's infectious. [Jesse] You don't have a gym membership. You know, I'm a team manager, essentially, right? I want to help you as a member of a club, as a team. Like, put you in a position where you can do anything. For me, that's kind of been our motto, especially the last couple years, is use your fitness. Don't come in here and just lift weights to just lift more weights. Take it and do something great with it. Casey is the one who-- she was the one who started the whole Iceland thing. It wasn't a cycling race. She just came up to me one day in class and said, "Hey, we need to take the gym and find a reason to go to Iceland." So, the WOW cyclothon, as a team we're looking at, you know, somewhere about 850 total miles, and the race circumnavigates the entire island of Iceland, following the ring road, which is the main route that goes around. The race is held during the summer solstice, so when the earth is rotated just enough that Iceland is going to have 24 hour midnight sun, we can race around the clock 24 hours, which is really cool. And then the race is 72 hour cap. I wanted to see, like, what could come out of the relationship, so, what could come out of the group, like, could we believe that we could actually do it? And everyone was kind of in, and then we started the conversation of, "Holy cow. What's it going to take to really do this?" -[Hammer] Hey. -[Scott] Oh. -How are you? -Welcome. -[Hammer] Thank you. -[Scott] It's good to see you. It's really cool that everyone's here. -It's the first time. -Pretty excited. -Hey, Hammer. -Hey, hey! [laughs] It could be the last time until we all... -I think it is. -...see each other in Iceland, so. Unless you guys want to pay for my ticket. Yeah, all right. So, here's what's happening. So, we have four hour blocks. So, in the van, Team A for two hours is going to ride. Swapping every 20 minutes, the rider. So, one person's going to be sitting in the van for 20 minutes, one person's is going to be riding 20 minutes. One's first sitting in the van for 20 minutes, one's going to be riding. We're going to do that for two hours. Then Team B is going to take over, and they're going to do the same thing. At the end of the four hours, we're going to meet up with the RV. Teams C and D are going to get out of the RV, they're going to get into the van, right? So, now we're doing the exact same thing with C and D, right, for another four hours. There will never be two bikes on the road except, possibly, at the very beginning and at the very end, and we can discuss that here in a little bit. The other thing that, that we need to maybe think about a little bit is decision making while we're there. Because it can be pretty confusing if ten people are trying to make decisions. So, just like we need to think about-- I don't think-- if, if we have our systems down beforehand, but if something goes wrong, and there's like five or six different opinions, ultimately someone's got to make a decision, everyone-- even if they think it's the wrong decision, -need to go along with it... -[Matt] Absolutely. ...if we're going to be competitive and, and keep moving. I agree with you. Making a bad decision is sometimes better -than not making a decision at all. -Right, exactly. Any other questions? Did I answer your questions that you had? -Would-- -I think so. -Yeah, I mean, I think the... -Does this make sense? ...like, the trans-- the transition, the transitions are going to be the key. Right, and we're going to-- we're, as a team, we're going to practice those -before we go there. -Right. So, that's-- you know, so we'll have them dialed. Um, we'll have it figured out, you know, where we can start, what we need to think about, what we have-- so we're going to just need to go out with a vehicle, -with your van and a trailer... -Right. ...and do this, and go and send people out on the road for 20 minutes at a time. [uplifting music] -[pedals and chains whir] -[cyclists chatter] [all shouting] Go, go, go! Why don't we say that if you are... the team who is beginning to ride, you're on the middle line. -Is that correct? -[woman] Yeah. -[Casey] Yes, yes. -Or is it the opposite? [Jesse] We're all-- we're trying to transition -as a group not individuals. -[man] Right. So be in a single file line. Front rider will pass the front rider and everyone takes off. -[woman] Okay. -That's put six and six pretty tightly closed. [gentle uplifting music] [whoops and cheers] -[woman 1] Go, go, go! -[woman 2] Go hard, go hard. [man] Scott, I'm coming in on your right! [woman] Lane, lane! [woman] Oops, sorry, sorry, my bad, my bad. Whoo! My bad! To what extent-- once we get, once we-- so, the vehicle stops, the bike's off, you're ready to go. -Right? -Do you-- -Well-- -You don't see the rider yet? [Scott] Let's, okay, so, let's stop practicing group exchanges. You should stay-- I think you should stay in the right. -Yeah. -So you're safe, you're out of the road, until you hear whoever's hailing to you... -[woman] Lane. -...yell, lane, lane. That-- that's your signal to not only-- -[woman] To hammer on it, yeah. -Well, not hammer, but get up to some speed, get into the left position, 'cause that means I'm getting close enough that we're going to try and match speeds. And then it's either speed or coast, right? [Casey] But then I have to cross over from the right lane to the left lane. -No. -[Casey] So that's why-- yeah. No. I mean, you're going to have to go into the left lane at some point, or the left part of the lane, but you can't just hang out in the middle of the road. That's why I'm saying, I'm almost thinking we should shift what we were doing before. -We were in the left. -I don't-- I agree, actually. I think we should be transitioning with the rider who's starting on the right and the other rider on the left. That's-- I'm fine with that as long as that's our, -our rock solid... -'cause that's when you're going to be riding -where you're going anyway. -...concrete condition. And I agree, if you're the rider, it's easy to consume the lane early and say, like, "Okay, I'm in the lane. Lane, lane," like, that means I'm coming at you on the left, -and you need to be riding-- -So we're going to pass-- so the-- -So, now we're passing on the left. -On the opposite -to what we have been doing, okay. -Just take the lane -and stay true. -We're wired in our brains to do that anyway. [Katie] So who feels that they have this down and is ready to show us? 'Cause I'm a little confused about our just change of happenings. [gentle music] [Jesse] We're exactly one month. I was just looking at the calendar. We race one month from today. Got your transitions dialed. Not quite perfect there yet, but... getting close. But truly, none of us have done this before this race, so, or anything even like it, like, traveling to another country has been... God, the logistics are crazy. I mean, if this were just a trail running race, you know, pack the shorts, pack the shoes, get on the plane, go. All of a sudden we take a trailer and we got to outfit that trailer. We got 10 bikes now, so we realize we need an 11th bike, and everyone's got all their gear, all their stuff, all the food, the RV, really just-- Even insurance, all that other stuff, all the little pieces, so. It's been great to have ten brains on it, that's for sure. But I do think, it's been stressful the last few weeks, you know, because everyone's like, you know, you're not a professional athlete, you got, you know, a bunch of us have got kids, most of the guys have kids. You know, there's always that piece, and everyone's got a partner or something, another piece of life, and they're already letting you go for ten days without them. But then they don't realize that they're also agreeing to two or three months of: I've got to go to meetings and logistics and planning and, you know, be gone for this and gone for that, so, we got some pretty good partners. [Matt] As a parent, it's definitely important, for me, for them to see both their mom and I engaged in physical activity. Not active just through high school, not active through college, and in fact, not even primarily active through high school, but active throughout their entire life. You know, in terms of being a stay at home dad, this trip's important because they do get to see me as something other than, you know, the, the dad that's just, uh, you know, cooking dinner or whatever else, they get to see me in a, in a different role. [Krissa] All through high school, I was a three sport athlete. In college, I played, um, soccer and lacrosse and rugby. Um, so, I'm just kind of ready to get back into that, the whole, you know, being able to call myself an athlete again. [Scott] In order to be happy and productive and a valuable part of your community, you have to be sort of satisfied within yourself, and, and one of the ways I always feel that you can do that is through figuring out a really good balance in your life, where you're happy with the amount of work you're putting in and you're happy with the sort of time you're spending with your family and you're happy, uh, with the time you're spending with yourself out in the woods and with friends. When you can find that... it makes you a much more pleasant person to be around, for your family, for the people you work with, for the people you play with. [Blue] We were always kind of like road racers and triathletes and that sort of thing, but I never really had done group exercise, and didn't really understand how it, how it could possibly work in our lives. And, and then we met Jesse, and he just had a way of making us do absurd things that somehow, the end result was you felt incredible and you, you lost your self-consciousness, and I guess that's a strange, uh, strange phrase, but I've, I've thought about that a lot, of kind of working hard enough in whatever you're doing to lose yourself. [gentle music] [Katie] We're on the island, we're seeing everything. I haven't put a lot of thought into how it's going to feel. And it's definitely going to be intense. [Erik] I think the beast kind of comes to life the closer we get to it, and we start putting our hands on it, and you start realizing that this, you know, big elephant in the room or whatever, looks more like a dragon instead of an elephant, and you're trying to figure out how those pieces move. [Katie] Every race I've done, I like to pre-drive part of the course at least. I think it's good to know what you're starting with. But then, after that, I recognize, and it works for me to know that you're just going to go and you get what you get, and you'll change your plans anyways. So, I like the way that the teams attack that too. We've got a rough plan and we're ready to adapt to it. [Jesse] Fuckin' railroad tracks. [Scott] Yeah, fucking railroad tracks. -[Erik laughs] -[car roars past] [Jesse] Railroad tracks make me nervous. This is like 16 of them in a row. -[Erik] Yeah. -And we got cars coming, guys, so. [woman] I wonder if they'll put something over it? -[wind blows] -Can get a little brutal. No, you just, Hammer, tuck, tuck your head [chuckles] and just be like, "Oh!" [Matt] We just don't, we're not ever going to be plugging in... -[Kevin] To 1.10. -...to a 2.20. [Scott] The only, the only way we could use that is for us if we had 2, 20... All right, last thing, totes, helmet, shoes, food. -Yes? We've all made it. -[all] Yes. We have 2 hours 15 minutes till the van departs for the transition. So 4:30. 5:00 p.m., the RV team needs to be loaded departing for the race. And that drops Erik at the start, 6:00 p.m. If you need-- if there's anything he needs, wants to warm up, we'll still hang out. Erik lines up 6:45, 7:00 begins crush. -Yes. -And we wait... -[all speak] -...and we wait with Kevin, we'll depart once the race is clear, obviously clear, right up to Route One to the junction. Wait there for an all clear from Scott or Hammer on the cell phone. Right, we're going to be the first transitions out of you. If for some reason you don't hear from us, either we didn't make it or we don't have cell service. -I guess those are two possibilities. -[Jesse] In the event that we don't hear from you, that means you didn't make it. [laughs] Then, we're all dead, right? [Jesse] You're all dead or there is no cell phone service, we are to assume that a rider will make it, meaning, Erik will get himself together and give it to you, and you're going to take off. Yeah, there's not much else we can do. I'm pretty sure on that drive that we always had at least a-- -we didn't have-- -We don't have text. Yeah, we should have enough to get text though. So all I can say is, six, six months of planning, right? And we're finally here. I know everyone is starting to feel that just a little bit. I can't tell you guys enough how excited I am to be a part of this madness. -It's-- -[woman] Madness, yes. It's time, it's time to just let go of all the things that we've forgotten and all the things that we can't control, and now it's time to do the fun part, right? It's to get in the race. Arguably, a lot of the hardest stuff is done. Keep counting on that and take courage from that. We're going to get through this thing and I think we got a chance to win it. -So, let's go. -[all chuckle and cheer] -[Jesse] TruStrength on three. One, two, three. -[all] TruStrength! And trailer, you guys need to load up, -four racers. -One, two, three, bye. -Bye, good luck! -Bye. RV, we still got half an hour. -[all chattering] -[man] I want to look, I want to look at a map... -Bye, I love you. -...before I go. -Go. -Bye, you guys. -We're going. -It's going to be great! It's going to be great. It's going to be great. [somber music] [group chatter] Achievement. -Okay. -All right, survive this backhand. -Got it? -[man 1] How much time do I have? We got basically six minutes. Just do what you always do, man. Ride, have fun. -Yeah. -You ride hard when you have fun. It's just a big pack. Hang with a group that you feel best with. We'll see you in the gravel. [announcer] Three, two, one, have a good race! -[crowd cheers] -[whistles] [applause] [cheering] [light dramatic music] [wheels swoosh] [bicycle clicks] -Awesome. -Yeah, pretty cool, huh? It is. Katie, this is Scott. Any sign of Erik yet? [bike whirs] Erik. -Go, Katie! -[clapping] Put it on two. -All right, let's get you on. -[Erik gasps and pants] -I just... -[Scott] Don't worry, we'll hear about it in a second. -Let's keep going. -Yeah. Where is-- where. My God. [panting] Okay. -[van bumps and bounces] -[woman] Oh, my God. [woman] My bike's almost off. -[man] Oh, whoop, whoop. -[woman] Come here, stop. [man] Let's put it all on the rack. -[man 1] All on the rack. -[man 2] All on the rack. -[traffic roars past] -Lost them. [man] Oh, that chain's a mess. [car door closes] Katie, are you off the pavement yet? Are you on pavement yet? [radio crackles] [Scott] In a way. Transition pile up. Tell her we'll see her at the bottom of the hill. [Erik] We'll get to the bottom of the hill. [Katie] Okay, I see it. [bike whooshes past] -[woman] Break! -All right. -Here's to 40 hours. -[indicator clicks] [sighs] And paying attention to other people and not killing them. [Erik] How long has she been out? [woman] Uh, eight minutes. [Erik] Hold the line. [bike whirs] [man] Can we transition faster? [laughs] [Scott] No, there's no-- there's nobody around, yeah, no one, no one to ride with. So maybe it'll come together later in the race, we'll see. Let's do this. [sighs and clears throat] -[clapping] -Good job. [Scott] All right, good job. [all laughing] -[Scott] I don't know about that. -Yeah. You never know. Yeah, I'm a little bit behind. [light dramatic music] [traffic whooshes past] [woman] Go. -[man] Go on, Erik! -[woman] Go, Katie! -[Scott] What's up, dude? -[Erik sighs] I was fucking hauling ass over that thing. [panting] That was an awesome stretch. -[Scott laughing] -Holy fuck, I wish I had someone to draft. Good times. Thanks for the downhill, guys. [man] Yeah, nice crag. I know. -[Scott] We good? -Yep, good. Locked, loaded, ready to go. Nice work, guys. -Good job! [laughs] -[cyclists] Woo! [panting] Lane! Speed, speed! Get my wheel! [Matt] Gap's closing. It is big time. [puffing and panting] A little bit of good catch up there. -[Blue] Clear. -Go. [panting] -[Matt] It's one minute. -I'm spending a lot of money though. -Yeah. -Ooh. He's a B rider? -[Blue] Well, uh, I believe so. -Okay. We've been, we've been, like, pretty much on their ass. So, if I-- in this two hours I can catch him, -we can work with him, hopefully. -[Blue] Let's hope so. [Scott] We're definitely catching him. Yeah, yeah. [Scott] Quickly. [Blue] Looking good, Jesse, nice and strong. [radio bleeps] -[man] No, nobody, no. -[Scott] Do we want to-- -[Blue] Yep. Making conversation. -[Scott] Yeah. [Blue] Say, what if they can't speak English? [bike whirs] [woman] That's nice! That's nice. [coughing] Yeah. [Scott] You were looking strong out there. That was sweet working with that dude. [Jesse] Nice work, Blue, you're killing it. When you get behind him in the draft, stay tight, you'll just get pulled along, -it's beautiful. -[Scott] That transition. [man] Nice flow! [claps] -[bikes whirs past] -[Scott] Whoa. [rider] Lane! [gentle music] [Jesse] It's really good to have a clear visual so your brain and your body will take you there all the time. But at the same time, not being so attached to that vision, you know, but letting yourself be a part of the process, so that you can truly enjoy whatever it's going to be. 'Cause ultimately, you know, our grand, our grand idea of crossing the finish line all together as a team and having this, like, momentous feeling, it may be, you know, majorly different than what we've pictured. And I think we still want to be a part of that process for the full 40 hours or whatever it is that we're out there. And so, I think that's the big part, is just to release and be in the moment, try to practice mindfulness, even on the bike when you're suffering. -[cyclists chatter] -[wind blows] [Erik] Okay, we're going to cross the plane, so. You can get back, I'll get her, thank you so much, I don't want you to lose your spot. [Casey] Erik, do you want me to drop this? [cyclists chatter] [Scott] You're great. We did a good job on the wind. I know it's hard to drop. -[Matt] Thank you, it was, uh-- -Who are these? Your bags. We drove across there, we were getting blown all over the place. [Casey] Does anybody know if Oxi's closed the RV's? [Scott] And there's no way to communicate, so. [Matt] So if you end up with a pace line with them in the wind... -No, I didn't know, that. -...they'll, they'll put, uh... -No, we don't know. -...and it makes sense why they stagger the way they do. [Casey] I thought we'd go around. Don't worry, they'll let us know. The race, the race support will let us know. -[man] You guys all set? -I have my bike. We've been looking at segments and we're heading into the, uh, high pass in the mountains, that's all gravel climbs, we've got to do that on a mountain bike. And then there's a big mountain bike descent that's on loose gravel, and they're going to end with that. So, I have no idea how racers are going to feel at that point. And they're saying that the pass is open, but that visibility is really low. So, it's, you know, it's going to be dangerous. We got to be, we got to be really careful. [rumbling wind] [light dramatic music] [Jesse] It's, it's harder than we expected. Uh, and I, I-- you know, we talked a lot about, conceptually, what 850 miles of racing is going to feel like, and we chopped it up into short segments. And I think we all thought, "Oh, I'm going to have an eight hour rest and I'm having a four hour rest." There's no rest. I mean, you're either driving, you're cooking food for other the people, you're making coffee for people, you're packing your bag, you're getting dressed, you're getting ready to race, you're switching over the van. I think, just the pace is so high, and to hold that level, and to not get swept away into the chaos, like, keep your head and keep doing your job for 30 hours. It's exhausting. Like, exhausting. [Erik] So, will they be there? [Scott] Yes. -[Erik] So-- -[Scott] Yeah, maybe, no. -That's behind us. -[Hammer] Erik, don't distract him. -[Erik] What? -[Hammer] These driving conditions suck. -[Erik] Okay. -[Scott] It's true, I'm actually, just grab my-- -[Erik] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Car ahead. -[Scott] Car. [Erik] Aw, Jesus Christ! Ah! [Hammer] Oh, my God. -[Erik] Fucking hey. -[Hammer sighs] -Yeah. -[Scott] Slow down. Jesus. -[Hammer] All right, well... -[Erik] That's scary. ...that brought my, um... stomach to my throat. [Katie] My dad and brother had started to do triathlons, and they were like, "You should do it." They kept asking me to do it. I never wanted to do it. And then about a month out, I was like, "All right, fine, I'll do it." So I had no actual training, I just went into it. And the experience itself of doing that was amazing. [Erik] How are you doing? [gentle music] You want Hammer to jump on the bike for a little bit? -[Katie] I'm good. -[Erik] Okay. [Katie] It's like I was crossing the finish line, and everyone is here reminding me, you know, the next 50 yards. You can do it. And it was hard as hell, but that was kind of when I realized that, like, there was something worth training for. I'd never really competed before. And that was when I realized I want to put the effort in to train. I've decided that I wanted to take my own fitness a little bit more seriously and just see what I could do. That's the whole reason that this is fun, just to see what you can do. [Scott] All right, hands down that was so beautiful. -[Hammer] Oh, I bet. -[woman] I didn't get to see much. [Hammer] Scott, when you get a chance, can you unhook my... -[Matt] Nice work, Katie, nice work. -Thank you. -[woman] No. -[Hammer] All right, who's bikes are coming off? [whistling] [Kevin] If our numbers are right we need to average 17 from here on out to get into Reykjavik by 7:00 p.m. tomorrow. [man whistling] This is dying, so, I need to have somebody charge it. I left it on this afternoon. -[woman mumbles] -[man] Didn't want to lose them. -[woman] Okay. -Okay, I'm on it. [woman] Go, Kevin, you got it! [Kevin] I enjoy the challenge of it and knowing that most people won't. It's sad, you know, 'cause, it's-- yes, there's modern conveniences all around us now, but the natural world's still out there. And so many people are detached from that now. [ethereal music] [Matt] To take away the safety net is all the more reason to do it. Because you have to be able to be independent. You have to be able to overcome whatever obstacles come your way. And I think that makes it all the more enjoyable. It gives you all the more sense of accomplishment when you're finished with it. It's really about how deep can I dig? You know, how-- can I, can I keep going even though I really don't want to keep going? And I think there's this kind of just mentality. Some people want to do that, some people don't. I don't think it's good or bad. But the opportunity to go on a trip with ten people that share that, and to have to dig deep, and be with them at the same time. That's, that's huge. [Kevin] I'd like to ride the next one. [cyclists chatter] This is B, this isn't bad. [car door opens] [coughs] [van rumbles on road] [traffic hisses past] How far behind are they now? The RV? -[Krissa] We don't know. -Oh. [Kevin] I don't even know what time it is. [pills rattling] [Kevin] You want to suit up? Hand off? Or are we waiting for the RV? Solid hour of sleep? -[Hammer] No response. -[woman] Oh. [laughs] Oh, man, my butt is chiseled out of steel right now. Ready to rock out another four hours. [claps] I wish I was going back out. -I know. -[Hammer] You want to trade these? -If you do want to, I'll go. If you want sleep. -Pass. -What? -Pass. [Jesse chuckles] [Scott] You see, this is... so this is them, so I don't know what to do about it. -[cyclist shouts] -[Blue] Yeah, I don't understand. I thought she was going to follow us. -[man] Yep, right. -[Blue] Are they just going to transition here then? -And then... -[Scott] I don't know. What the fuck? Did they not understand? -This is Matt, right? -It's Matt. -But we don't have a ride. -[man] Do you have a bike? -[All] No! -They were supposed to come forward. They, they didn't come up. [traffic purrs past] -[Jesse] Budge up. -[Blue] Careful. [woman] So, what are we doing? [Scott] Grab a bike, throw it in the RV and we'll, and we'll drive forward. -So, I'll go in there. -Yeah, I don't see -any other way. -Okay. You were supposed to forward us up, like, beyond that. -Come on. -Yeah, everyone else should come out. Yes, let's all go in, let's all go in here. [woman] Watch out. Yep, we've just transitioned. -Yep. -[Scott] Go ahead. All right, we'll pick up Matt and, er... I don't know, he could be hanging out there now. They're going to transition, there's going to be no one there for him. [Casey] Can't you guys... [man] All right, well, thank you. -[man] Can we dig my shoes out? -[woman] We need to drive. [man] We need to drive to pick up Matt. I know you guys are tired. -[Katie] We'll be short, but-- -Yeah, Matt's getting kind of screwed, but. All right. [Erik] Jesse, you only need one rider set right now. -Let's send Blue out. -[Erik] What? -Send Blue out. -[Blue] I need my shoes on. -I need my shoes on. -Yeah, okay. [Kevin] Closing this. [Katie] Okay. I mean, as long as they Matt off the bike. [Erik] As long as they get Matt off the bike we'll be fine. [Casey] It's really not effective to sound like a pain, because it's so much chaos trying to be in an A, B, C, A, B, -that none of us can... -[Erik] Yeah, okay. ...focus on where you guys are at. -Okay. -And you're coming from behind, so you need to tell us, "We're 60 minutes out," so we know there's an end in sight. Yeah, yeah, I get that, and it was hard 'cause we just didn't have-- -our service was so spotty. -Yeah, no, no, I just-- -Communication is really-- so. -[Kevin] It's been difficult on this side of the island. -Yeah, this side-- -[Kevin] Katie, we going again? Well, we have to wait for Krissa. -[Katie] I just want to get us-- -[Casey] Apart? [Katie] Yes, out of sticky zones, so. You guys-- everyone, everyone solid here? -As far as... -[Kevin] Yeah. [Casey chattering] Well, for what it's worth, great job, guys. Like, I know you're exhausted and you're tired, and you're like-- -[woman] We pulled some good time. -You know, I get it that it's, it's demoralizing and, like, really rugged. [Erik] I was going downhill, pedaling hard with the group -doing 12 miles an hour. -Downhill? [man chattering] I came around a corner, my average went from 19.1, and I finished at like 17 something, 'cause the headwind was that bad. We did poles of like... five meters. And, and it's pretty scary when you're-- people are telling, like, talking gibberish to you, and you're sending them out to ride 25 miles an hour in a big group that's... -It's not for-- -But working with them -has been-- it was good. -Yeah, no, it's good -to work in a group. -Yeah. But when people are telling you they can't do it... [Krissa] There's always one. [tense music] [bird calls] -I need to ride up and grab his bike. -[Kevin] Good. You going to ride ahead? Let's go, you can drive ahead. Go ahead and drive. Drive. [traffic whooshes past] [bird calls] [Jesse] The suffering is an opportunity to grow, okay, it's an opportunity to change. It's an opportunity to find some other level in yourself so that when you meet challenges, you can overcome. No matter how many challenges come up, I do think that we're well prepared mentally to grind through them, uh, to support each other, to push each other. I think that's our strongest asset. [Hammer] I see strength as a balancing act in many respects. It's finding, you know, that, that gray area where you push yourself, but also, you have to know your capacity. It's great to have a goal but I think it's also knowing that that goal can be flexible. [Hammer] They moved. -[Scott] They tried a fresh group? -Yep. [woman] That wasn't-- it was a different beat. Different beat, yeah, I think that's the thing. Yeah, that blue group moves faster than the other group, definitely. [woman] Yeah, I'm in survival mode, in a good vibe. Are you doing-- are you not hurt? [Hammer] Um... -[car door opens] -Do you want to do my next beating? -[man] Sure. -All right, thank you. -Okay, okay. -Keep going, keep going, we'll get you on the next transitions. I'm going to catch him right now. No, it's a C. I know. I know, I know. Get the A bike ready, that's all we got to do. Matt, your bike's going in the RV. -[Matt] Got it. -Look for Casey. I'm going to go ride-- I'm going to go catch the C right now, warm up and ride the A. -Head wind. -[man] Tail wind? Nope. [bikes whir past] -You good, Scott? -[Scott] I'm good. -[man] Sorry. -[Scott] You going to make me stand out here in the rain? -Am I not wet enough? -[man] Sorry, sorry. All right, we're out of here. Tell Casey to mount up! [bird calls] [Hammer] Casey, I hope you're not opposed to my wheel, yours is tangled! I'm going out, no one else is ready. [woman] Yeah. [traffic whooshes past] [Blue] Coming in, Jesse. Your legs look great. [clapping] Yeah, we need to get them. What happened, does anyone know? [Kevin] They just had a bad transition. -Gotcha. -[Kevin] So. They just wanted to make sure that we do a little more. They said we can leave them, but, but they would not. -[Jesse] That's great to hear. -And I said, "Yeah, of course, we're not leaving them. We're riding in together." We've been together since we came on yesterday afternoon. [Blue] Yeah, well, we got this groove. [gentle music] [Krissa] Go, go, go! Go, go, go! Clear! -[footsteps] -[gears click rapidly] [Casey] Reykjavik's struggling, but I've sort of been with him since who knows when and they're not going to ditch him, -so I told them-- -[Kevin] Well, even with the two of them since-- Yeah, yeah, I told them we're not ditching him. -I mean, we could go out with the other team and... -[Kevin] No. -...and crank but it's not-- -I don't want to do it. -No. -No, me neither. [bikes whoosh past] [uplifting music] No one's trying to drop you, so let him know if you got to-- don't get dropped, holler out. Be like, -hold up just a bit. -[woman] Yeah, okay. Everyone's doing well. What's happened in terms of working with these teams and working on pace lines together and pulling through is, you know, with these, with these alliances and this partnership, to me, that's the biggest win in the race, right there. [woman] Absolutely. I couldn't agree more. I mean, I feel like I got an experience in terms of interacting with these people that are from here that you just can't trade. [woman] Yeah, I agree. Hi. We're just thinking if we should cross the finish line together? -Yeah, yes. -All the teams? Okay, that's great. Here we go, baby! Erik, your bike's in the near pole with Scott's. -Yeah, I'm going to let Scott use it. -Okay. -All right, we good? -[Erik] We're good. [sighs] I'm kind of kind of sad it's going to be over. Sounds kind of sadistic but... You work so hard and train so hard for something and then it's going to end soon. That's my buddy! -I know it's a little unreal that it's going to end. -Yeah. [laughs] -We're all getting kind of sad. -We'll all be crying, yeah! So hurry and just going back, right? Yeah. [ethereal music] [bikes whir past] [man] The birds are flying around. Nice work, Blue. [man] That was the last, last transition -before the-- -What time is it? -[man] No, we have one more transition in our lives. -Whatever, we're just going to crush this last bit. -We're going to crush it. That's right. [woman] Should we offer them our maple syrup? [Erik] Ten kilometers until we get there, -till we get to that transition. -[woman] We got our transition when we get all -the bikes put together. -[Erik] I just can't wait to see that single digit. [Erik] Nine. [indicator clicks] [people cheering] -Are we going swimming already? -[Blue] Yeah, right. You may not want to swim in that, it's got a-- It smells better than us. This is your bike, I'll give you yours. [Casey] Here's your, uh... [all chattering] -One last one. -Have them. For the, uh, Icelandic team to hit the finish all 40 riders... -Oh, uh, all right. -Let's do it. [ethereal music] [Casey] When we all lined up, it just was, it was the trip I had envisioned. You can go on a trip and you can be changed, and you can be engulfed in culture and experience, those types of trips and travel, but this was like the entire gamut just thrown into one bucket. [Erik] I see strength in people. I really-- I enjoy getting to know people and seeing them grow, and in that process-- and maybe that's part of being a teacher, is through their growth, they also teach me a lot of things. [Jesse] Human motion versus resistance, right? Our idea is that you're always moving through space, you know, your whole life, that's what you're going to be doing. We've got to find ways to make that easier, uh, to open up new chapters of the book, you know. I think fitness is really just about creating a richer tapestry of your life. The end of our lives is always coming towards us, right? We just got to decide what we want to do with it. [Blue] You know, it just could not have, it could not have ended in any more poignant of a way for me. So, I'm incredibly grateful for that experience and, and to witness that much beauty. When we get out of our head and actually experience, um, things just as truly as experience and not as consciousness, we're trying to lose our consciousness and just step into the river of humanity's consciousness, and, and doing things with other people to that extremeness where you really lose self-consciousness. Uh, you know, it's, um, I think life defining, I mean, those are the moments that you remember the most fondly, and it's honestly why I probably keep signing up for bizarre things that Jesse will suggest we do.
