- You have precisely one minute to tell me where he's hiding it. 53 seconds. 52. 51. 50. 49. 48. 47. 46. - Dude, I don't know. - 45. 44. - No! - 43. - Stop. - Where is it? You're making this more difficult than it needs to be. - I've waited long enough. - What are you... Wait a second. What are you doing? - I've waited plenty. 33, in fact. Where is Tito hiding it? Tock. Tick. - Fuck! His office. The desk, behind his desk... - Thank you. - Wait, you can let me go now. I won't tell anybody, I swear. - I'm sorry, friend. Punctuality is keen and you were late. Your time is up. - You don't know Africa by Toto? That shit is dope. - Yeah, they had Hold The Line. Yeah, they had Rosanna. - Yo, hold on there, Tarzan. Incoming Jane. - It's gonna be $12.13. - Really dude? An hour late? - Go for it. - Oh come on, it wasn't that bad. - You think that's cool? - Hey, my purse! - I couldn't find the address. It's... - Satan's Pizza. Delivery fast as hell or its free. - Bro - Come on, dude. You're paying for this pizza. - Jesus. Fuckin' idiot. - Got a dirty brat comin' up. - 2.25. - Here you go. - So'd you read that article about that guy Tito? - That's crazy what happened. - Here's your change, man. - I know, man. - I don't know, man. Cut up a guy's face like that? Who'd do that to a guy? - What the fuck, asshole? - Hey! What's your problem? - Pardon me, do you have the time? - No, sorry. - Hey, what's that in your hand? - It's my first day. I just got my card. - Those monkeys are about to go bananas. - Man, I'm gettin' hungry. You want anything from the kitchen? - Uh, yeah. I just had somethin' sweet, and now I think I'll take something salty. - Yeah, that makes sense. Come in. Oh Jesus. Hey man, didn't you hear me say... - Bad cop. Down. Sit. - Shit. - Don't get up. In fact, why don't you sit back down as well. - Okay man. Just let her go, okay? Hey there. How you doin'? The greatest serial killer in Lincoln City's history. And a lovely decorator. I like it. Not so fast. Not so fast. I've got a few errands I need run, and I frankly just don't have the time for them. While I'm certain you're busy waiting to be put to sleep and all, I might have a proposition for you. Interested? Excellent. You know, I'm not really a key person. You have just a few hours to do everything on my list, or boom. I really wouldn't mess with that. - All the news you need to hear, and quite a bit you don't on the Lincoln City Dispatch. And now, some breaking news. An explosion in Precinct 13 has left many dead and some in fear that an inmate might have escaped. The mayor is asking that citizens stay away from the 900 block of George W. Bush Parkway until further investigation takes place. However, the officers are quite fearful of stepping in the building, it seems that there is a murderous madman loose. - No. Hold on. - No, that is what he said but it is not what he meant. You're taking it completely out of context. - Yes? - Good morning, Mayor. Or is it afternoon already? - Who is this? - No caller ID? - Answer me! - I freed your little cutter friend this morning. He's out painting the town red, I hear. He's free for a reason. - Which is? - We'll get to that in a second. But first, I assume you're surrounded by officials, coppers and perhaps a D.A. or two? Now imagine if they were all dead. Killed because you couldn't cut a simple deal. - Look, I don't give a shit who you are. I don't work well with threats. - I'm not threatening you. I'm telling you exactly what will happen if you don't give me what I want. - I'm listening. - Cops. I want them off the street until midnight. - That's absurd. There's no way that... - A whole lot of people are going to die today, there's no way around that. I've placed a number of bombs all around the city. They don't need to go off. I'm not a terrorist, here, just a guy who needs to catch up on some work. So are we clear? Do you understand that it's all on you? 100% your call. - Now wait, why don't you just tell me what this is all about? - Two words: Tito's bag. - Pick a card, sweet thing, any card. - They're all facing you. - Fine, I'll close my eyes. Better? - Um, hmm. So what do I get if you're wrong? - I'm never wrong. - Even so, if you win, you get my number. If you lose, then what? - What's your favorite flower? - Um, okay. Uh, camellia. - Okay, if don't get your card exactly right, next time I see you, I'll bring you a dozen camellia flowers. - Okay, then deal. - Take the cards, shuffle them out, spread 'em across the table. Go ahead. Spread 'em out. - Okay. - Hmm. - So, what's your number? - I don't have a phone. - Hey miss? Can I get my check? - I, I'm so sorry about that. Can I get you anything else? - My check, that's it, that's all. - I'll be right back with it. - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. After a series of vicious attacks, Lincoln City is gripped by fear, as a killer is on the loose. Police are attempting to solve up to four homicides that occurred just today. With more on this developing story, we go live on the scene with Natalie Hershlag. Natalie, what can you tell us to make sense of this tragedy? - Lincoln City shop owners are on high alert as a man was murdered here just hours ago. While there were many eye witnesses, the suspect managed to flee the scene before police could arrive. This man is wanted for questioning in the deaths of what we now know to be three individuals, with his last victim being a Mr. William Henry Pratt. - It was insane. This guy in a orange jumpsuit walked up to this other guy, and he was like stab, stab, stab! I mean, that's some f (beeps) up sh (beeps). I never seen anything like that in my life. And he didn't say a word. - If you see an individual with long black hair wearing an orange outfit, call LCPD immediately. Do not approach him. We consider this person to be armed and extremely dangerous. - Police ask that you call 1-800-! 32-TIPS with any information. The reward is now set for 40,000 dollars, and remember, you don't have to give your name. Live from Lincoln Square, Natalie Hershlag, KMOC 5 News. - In other news, the death Of suspected crime boss Tito Hammer is still under investigation. - Hey, same time tomorrow? - If you're lucky. - And now for weather... - Hi, so sorry about that. I hope you have a nice day. - Oh, you know what? It's okay. It's not my tip. - Yes sir. I have never seen anything this phenomenal in my life. - It's basically a vortex of shit. It's the biggest tornado, and it hasn't left in 48 hours. I'm back. - Excuse me, sir? The cowboy's here. - Send him in. The mayor will see you now. - Fine time for you to show up. - You're lucky I'm here at all. When did he get out? - I got a call yesterday afternoon, and without that bag I'm helpless. - Bag? - Tito's bag. Tito got killed last week. His bag is out... - I'm here to bring Cutter down. That's it. I don't have time for some song, Mr. Mayor. - You don't get it! You find the bag, you find Cutter. With what's in that bag, I can rebuild this town. - Look, I'm countin' on you. We're countin' on you. - Fine. - Hey. Whoa. - We need to talk. - Excuse me? - You were at the Saloon last night, weren't you? - You stole his money. - I didn't take anything. - No, bullshit, man. You got those games fixed. - Do yo know who we are? Do you even know who you're talkin' to? - We're Jihyes, fuck face. - Yeah, Jihyes, bitch. - All that money you won last night, I want it. - Well tough shit, man, I won it fair and square. - Enough! Give us the money, or else. - Or else what? - Show him. - You really wanna find out? - Okay. All right. All right, be cool, man. Be cool. - Man, hurry the fuck up. Come on, let's go. Ah, fuck. - They're callin' the cops. Let's get the fuck out of here! - Right there, you! You are fuckin' dead! - Help's on the way. Don't worry. - Hey lady, you got the time? - I don't care about that. I don't know, ask me for the time. No, go away. Hey guys, give me that phone! - Yeah What have we got here? You guys want a Mentos? - Where's my purse? - Oh that's yours? I'm so sorry. Lookin' for trouble! - Woohoo! - Yeah. Hey lady, fuck you! - Hey, here's the purse. - What have we got here? - What the fuck is this? - Oohoo. What are you lookin' at? - Like a big old pumpkin. Huh? What do you want? - Look at this joker. - You gonna do a flip? Let's fuck him up! - Hello? - What are you lookin' at? - Fuck you man. Holy... fucking shit. What the fuck? - Fuck this! - Reports are now flooding in from all over the city. As police are now on the manhunt for this suspect. They're also looking for connections between all of the crimes, and they've already made several links, noting that each victim has had multiple stab wounds. So could this be the work of one person? Could a serial killer be on the loose in Lincoln City? The answer, quite simple, is yes. - Sir, I have to admit. I'm pretty surprised to see you still out here, and your friends still out here, especially after the stabbing just down the street. Why are you guys still here? - Because we decided to live life. I mean, yes, that was a bad situation that happened across the street, but we can't let that dictate how we live or what we do. So we're gonna stay out here, we're gonna party, we're gonna have a good time. - I mean that's pretty, that's pretty strong stuff. I have to admit though, with the police also putting this ban of making sure everybody has to go back inside, how are you going to deal with that situation? - Look, the police are gonna do whatever it is they wanna do. They could tell us to go home, but we're gonna stick out here. We're still gonna have a good time. We're still gonna party, man. We just gotta live life la vida loca, you feel me? - La vida loca. You heard it, you heard it here. Back to you, Janet. - Meanwhile, across the city, reports of yet another stabbing. This time just three blocks south of Old Manor Road and Austin Avenue. - I don't know if it was, the wackiest, whatever the fuck it was. Can I curse? I'm sorry. I'll try not to. But this is insane. So I stepped on my shoelace, so I noticed my shoelace was undone, so I went down to tie my shoelace and then I fell down on my own, but then, okay, so then I got back up and I started continuing to tie my shoelace, and then I got knocked over by this fucking guy that ran that direction, so I was like, what the fuck is that guy? So then I looked over there, and saw there was two guys. There's one guy running, the guy had a top hat, and he stabbed this other guy right in the fucking jaw. Like right in the jaw. - Unexpected. Stabbed in the face. Huh. - Certainly disturbing. In other news, the death of suspected crime boss Tito Hammer is still under investigation. - Yeah, hello? - Vinny, I need your help. Two Jiyhes just tried to kill me. - No way! - Yeah, they just stabbed a guy trying to get to me. - Jiyhe are after you, too? They may be lookin' for Tito's bag, the bag Kitty was askin' about. - This is a lot of information you're throwin' at me right now. - Word on the street is, she's holdin' somethin' of Tito's. - Let's talk more. I'll be right over. - Oh, hold on. I know there's some shady characters and motherfuckers involved but... - What you want, Vinny? - Listen, kid. Just head over, and I'll tell you what I know. - What? Why can't you tell me know? - I know this is shady as all fuck, but just trust me. - Okay, bye. ♪ When I hear your heavy shoes ♪ ♪ Clump so sweet and dear ♪ ♪ That heavy bumping sound ♪ ♪ Bangs in my little ear ♪ ♪ A clip clippy-clip ♪ ♪ A clop clippy-clop ♪ ♪ A clip clop cloppy clip-clop ♪ ♪ A clip cloppy clip ♪ ♪ A clop clippy clop ♪ ♪ Our clogging never stops ♪ ♪ Oh I love to dance and stomp ♪ ♪ With you in the strudel shop ♪ ♪ We love to clunk around ♪ ♪ With a happy clippy clop ♪ ♪ That happy clogging sound ♪ ♪ I can hear it all day long ♪ ♪ Let us sing this happy song ♪ ♪ You hop and I hop ♪ ♪ I hop and you ♪ ♪ We hop together ♪ - Fuck you, dude. - What can I say, idiot. - Just like I told Spike. - I know. - Just like I told Brick.

Fuckin' babysit the two. Fuck off! I need a fuckin' drink! Hey, turn it up, man! - Where will these killings end? For this particular victim, it ended at 49th and 6th. - It was terrible! I was so scared! I was talking to my son on the phone, and it was horrible! - The killer, the Cutter, were you able to get a good look at him? - Hell yeah. He was awful! He was hitting everybody with the knife, and it was, I thought I was gonna die. - Well there you have it. Another evil attack leaving this citizen and myself wondering, where are the police, and what is happening to our city? Live from downtown, I'm Natalie Hershlag with KMOC 5 News. - Fuck are you doin' here? - Where you off to, Kitty cat? Tito. I'm looking for something of his. - So what do you want from me? - Whoa. - I don't know anything about that. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who did this? - Occupational hazard. Look, I just found out about Tito myself. I don't know anything about that fucking bag. - Who said anything about a bag? - You did. - Cut the bullshit, Kitty. - I don't know anything. Although... - Don't fuck with me. - Patches might. I heard him talking about it with some of his girls. - Something tells me this is a little bit too big for your boss's britches. - Things have changed since you ran off. Patches is different. Patches, he's been busy. - I bet. Thanks, Kitty. - You're not goin' to see Patches, are you? - Don't worry about it. - Watch your back. - You really should, too. - Bless you, kind stranger. - Whoa, hey! Hey! Dude. Turn around, fuckin' prick. Come on. - Well, boys, that's how it's done. - Fuck! - Hey! You watch your language in front of Candy and Destiny. - My name's Candy. - Eh, whatever. - Come on, Patches, that's four in a row. - What's your point? - Oh, fuck me. - Where is it? - Where's what? - Tito's bag. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah that. Yeah, go fuck yourself! You're not gonna shoot me. - Some things have changed. - Yeah? I know how you like your girls. - I don't wanna repeat myself again. Who's looking for that bag, and what's it got to do with Cutter? - Patches, baby. - I don't know anything about a bag! I don't know who has it, I don't know where it is, I don't know what it is. Look, I got a good thing goin' on here. Your little Kitty alone brings me in 35 grand a week. - Speaking of Kitty, her neck? - Yes? - Any more bruises and it's more than just a thumb. - Oh, I'm sorry about that. - Excuse me, jeez. - There you are, sir. Thank you for coming. - Did you move my seat? - Yeah. - That's why no tip. - Oh, my bad. Just let me get that for ya. - You're gonna like it.

They're gonna take such good care of me. Watch this. Yes? - Call the cops! - A big black dick. - Hey, baby. You wanna come home with me tonight? We'll have a good time. I got a wolf in the back. - Dude, fuck off. - Just get in the back seat. All right? - You can't afford me. - Hate to see you leave, but love to see you walkin' away! What the fuck? That's that fuckin' Luck guy. Dude who took your fuckin' money! - Let's get him! - What do you want? - It's me. Let's talk. - 50 grand to whoever can scalp the cowboy's head! - Yeah boys! Do This! Let's go! Where'd he go? Where he at? - Where'd he go? Anybody see this dude? - Patches didn't know anything. - Well, he's fucking lying. - Someone's lying. Get off my back. It's your stupid fucking obsession, Harlan. - Cutter's out there looking for that bag, Kitty. - Look, this whole bag-Tito thing, I'm sort of mixed up in it, so I can't talk about it. - Let's get him. - Hey, hey, boys, look who we found. - OK, boys, let's get him! - Get off the phone, bitch! - That's gonna be some pretty money. - Good morning, mayor. Or is it afternoon already? - Who is this? - No caller ID? - Answer me! - I freed your little Cutter friend this morning. - All right, I'm comin'. - Painting the town red, I hear. - Hey, who's there? - He's free for a reason. Which is, we'll get to that in a second. - Oh, God dammit! - But first, I assume you're surrounded by officials? Coppers, perhaps a D.A. or two? Now imagine if they were all dead. Killed Because you couldn't cut a simple deal. - Look, I don't give a shit who you are. I don't work well with threats. - Hey! - I'm not threatening you I'm telling you... - Come on, motherfucker! Come on, let's go! You want some of me? Come on, motherfucker! Come on, motherfucker! I'll drop you like a sack of shit, motherfucker. Come on! Oh God dammit, God dammit! Oh, no, no, you cut my fucking hand off Cutter, wait, wait! No, no, no! - Aw shit. - Well look who we have here. Your ass is mine, cupcake. Hey, punk! You! - Right on my ass. Yeah, with a fucking pizza box. A fucking pizza box! - Looks like you got nowhere else to run. Go give me the money. - You ain't goin' nowhere. - Come on, come on! - Looks like you're the one who's not goin' anywhere. - Hey man, you get back over here. Yeah, you try to run, you fuckin' cowboy. - You insulted me. You took my money! You made me chase you all over! You know, I'm gonna calm down. You took my money. You insulted me. You made me chase you all over town. Why the fuck wouldn't I kill you right now? Why the fuck wouldn't I kill you right now?

What about lemons? - Hey, you girls look great tonight. - Dude, a massage parlor? - I love them so much. - Bro! - It's two dollars. That's a nice purse you have. Well I'll see you tomorrow, huh? Thank you very much. You know, environment. Bye. Bye! Hey, hey! You have to pay for that. - I'm sorry, what did you say? - Dollar 75, please. - How 'bout you give me all the money you got in that little fanny pack right there. Or I kick your fuckin' ass. Okay? - Well, no problem, I'll give it to you. - Whoa, hey. Whatever, dude. - Three 75 now! - I'm givin' in back, here we go. Oh, oh, oh, there we go. I'm givin' it back, here it is. It's yours. Have a nice day. Can you believe this lady boy? - I tell you. Watch this. - Oops! My, my apples! Yeah, keep running! I'll find you! And I'm gonna get even, too! (insult in Chinese) Doctor Howard, Nurse Fine, Doctor Howard. - Nurse Fine, may I please have more gauze? There's just so much blood. I hope he doesn't go into shock. - Mr.Harlan, how are you feeling? How is he doing? Sir, I think we lost a lot of blood. We're going to see if we can keep you in the hospital for about a day or two, okay? I need you to stay there. Please. And, uh, can I talk to you for a second, doctor? - Yes, doctor. - I need to leave right now. - Maybe you should ask the doctor. - Nurse Fine, will you come here, please? - Yes, doctor. - Thanks. This is really bad. What kind of school you went? This is pretty crappy? How about you? You're supposed to help her. What kind of suture? - I wasn't told to do that. She told me that... - That suture looks terrible. - Well, I use what I have. - I'm really disappointed in you. I thought you guys can do better. - I did the best I could. - This is no good. You guys do the suture, you let me know, okay? - Yep. - You even go to medical, huh? - You're right. Bush was probably the greatest president we ever had. I never thought about it. Yeah, yeah. You've convinced me. - Well of course I'll go home with you. - That's disgusting. - I thought you'd never ask. - Oh so you made a certain amount as a kid, oh wow, ooh. L-L-E-Y, whereas as all the other 15 movies it's S-A-L-L-Y, Strap on Sally. He's got the same kind of sore on his lip. - You do have the bag, don't you? - Of course I do, my dear. All part of the plan. Okay. Don't open it 'til I get there. - Silly pretty little Kitty. - What? - Who do you think you're talking to? - Well when am I supposed to meet you now? - Leave the timing to me. In fact, there's been a small change of plans. Do you have a problem with that? - You're changing the time? - My current location's been compromised. Now we're going to meet at El Pollo. - El Pollo. Fine. Whatever. One hour. See you there. - I asked for a bigger fish. - I love these movies. - Sick. What are you making us watch, dude? - Silence, flaca, pay attention to the metaphor. - Take the position. - This is my birthday. - The guy in the black, he's like an oil slick out in the Gulf of Mexico, and the fish is like punishing the oil... - So weird. - Guns and roses, what the fuck? We're watching a movie. Get back to your seat. - Harry! Harry! Yes! Hit him harder! - Satan's Pizza, delivery fast as hell, or it's free! - Shit! Look out! - Oh shit, move! Wolfie. - Huh, what? - Get up there. - Get him! Stop missing! - What? - Get him good! This is the best, man! You just had to be difficult, didn't you? - Hit him! - Oh, we're not done yet. - come on, let's do this! - Give me a second. - Come on, man! Kick his ass! - Come on, hit him! - Stand him up. - Hey, okay. All right. - I am sick and fucking tired of hippies like you. So we're gonna cut your pretty little hair from the inside out. - No! No! No, stop! I know where the bag is! I know where the bag is! Tito, Tito's bag. Everybody's lookin' for it, I know. Don't tell me you're not. - No, fuck that man. You're not talkin' your way out of this this time. - I fuckin' know where the bag is right now. - Is that the bag the boss is lookin' for? - Yeah, yeah, yeah! - Man, fuck the boss. Maybe we don't need a boss. Get him in here! Trunk this bitch! - Aw, yeah. - You better hope it's there when we get there, understand? You know what? One more thing. - Indeed, we hear at KMOC 5 have reached out to Mayor Wommack for an official comment on today's massive spike in violence. While he has yet to comment, the city has scheduled a press conference for tomorrow. - Could these attacks be linked not only to the serial killer, Cutter, but also to the death of alleged crime boss Tito Hammer, A.K.A. Bossman Tito? Here we have exclusive KMOC footage of Hammer leaving court just days ago. - More violence erupts across the city as police have organized a city-wide manhunt to catch the. - What is it? - What's goin' on down there? Where's the bag? - I'm workin' on it. - People are dyin' here. I need that bag! - Sir. - Stand by. I may have just gotten a lead. - These leads for the bag or for cutter? - Same thing, Cowboy. - I'm sick of this shit. - All right, sweetheart, hold still. - Oh, you got it, sir. - Where is it? Tell me what you know. - Hey guys, I got the shit. - Whoa! - The fuck? - That fucker. Is that the bag? - Oh shit! - Okay, let's think this through, all right? Look, it makes more sense if you get the bag. I got all this covered. You only have that. - I'm a better shot, man, just go. - Hello, anybody home? - Man, fuck you, you go get it! - Fuck you, I'm in charge. - Bullshit! - Wait. What about him? - Hmm. - Fuckin' bullshit! Seriously guys, seriously? Got it, I got it, yeah! What the fuck, what? - Uh-uh. Fuckin' lucky. Fuck, look. You don't wanna... - Fuckin' kidding me. What are you doing in the trunk? - I don't know, man, they just put me in here. - Sure you don't know why you're in here? - I'm a victim here, I was bein' robbed. - What kind of robbers leave this kind of cash on a guy? What, what is this? Why do you have this address? - What? - Did I stutter? - Easy with the gun, man! Lady named Kitty and a guy named Tick, Time Keeper, uh, the Ticker. Tito's bag, they have it. - That's impossible. - I fuckin' swear, man. They're meeting up for a date. At the old chicken place. - Where at? - El, El Pollo. I think. - Hey, hey! You can't just leave me here! - You shouldn't have lied to me. Just listen - Come on man. - I told you. - Open it up. - I don't, I don't have anything. Look in my wallet. Do you see any money in here? - What the fuck, you millennial credit card-carrying motherfucker. Give me your phone. You again? - You fucked up, old man! - I told you I would get you, huh? Take this! And this! - Is that all you got, fruit stand? Bring it. - Come on, punk, come and get it. - Come on, let's go. I got all damn day. - You want a banana, too? - Here, take this, ha! - Come on, let's go. Let's do it. - Worthless bums. - Aw shit. - Get off the street. Who are you? Was ist das? I mean I guess I can work with this? - Get out of here, punk! - Come on. Come on, baby. Come on, come on. Yeah. - Hey man, hey. Hey. You got a dollar? Hey man. Hey. You got a dollar? - Get out of the way. - Even a few pennies? Yo, I gotta feed my kids, yo. I got, you know, I just need one dollar. I'm tryin', and look at you, this nice jacket. - You see my face? Does it look like I'm havin' a good day? I don't have any money, man. Fuck off. - All right, all right, all right. - Anything else? - Um, we're good. Actually, can I get another one of these? - Holy shhh. - What are you doing here? - Shit. - Stop, don't run! Here, here! Kitty. Kitty! Stop! Why are you here? - What the fuck are you doing here, Harlan? - What do you think I'm doing here? - You came to get a bag. What do you think you're gonna do? Get the bag and run the city? You're too fucking stupid for that. - You know what? Save your breath. - Fine, go ahead and leave me like you did before. Where were you when I needed you? - Where was I when you needed me? I was out saving the fucking city. - Fuck you. You have no idea what Time Keeper and I had to do to get that bag. - You probably just laid there while he did all the work. Am I right? - You didn't have a problem paying for it, did you? - You're right. It wasn't worth it. - You won't need to worry about the Cutter anymore. - He's killin' everybody! He's got a... - He's a violent fucking moron. He is nothing. In no time, everything will be back to normal, once I have the bag. - Fuck it, I'm sending the cops back out at six. - That is not the deal we agreed on. - You held my hand to the fire, you terrorist fuck! - I have set things in motion that cannot be undone. The timing is flawless. By midnight, every... - Hey? Hello? You can't ignore me. - Oh shit. Stop, stop! What are you doing, you'll kill us both. Look, I can get you whatever the fuck you want. Just get this thing out of here. I can't do anything pinned to this desk. - All right, so what do we know about this bag? You. - I got some kids searchin' the schoolyards. That's all I got right now. - I got four guys lookin' for him out on the river banks. - What about you? What's goin' on with you? - I don't know a damn thing. Ask Gremlin. He's down there all the time, bangin' them hookers. - I stabbed a guy. - What, so nobody knows about this bag? What's the deal here? - But boss? What about that Luck guy? - This might sting a little. Ah, what the hell happened? - I tripped and fell down some stairs. - Really? You must think I'm pretty stupid. I know what you do. My father used to gamble. - Was he any good? - He never knew when to quit. - Sounds like he just didn't know how to play. - I'm serious. Sooner or later, everyone loses. - We are tired of that, mate. Up and down, all around, all right? - Whatever, you fuckin' mook. - If you didn't suck so much cock, it wouldn't be an issue. - But he liked it. - Apparently he didn't, 'cause he says it's shit. - Uh, um, sorry. - What? I'm sorry. - Did you happen to see where the guy in the black jacket went? - Are you fucking asking us this right now? - No. - Sorry, can't help ya. You can go. - Uh, just interrupt us. - Fruit for sale at discount! Discount, slightly bruised! 50% off! Banana, lady? - No! So gross. - Holy smokes. - Hey, hey you! You can't dodge me around these streets! You got somethin' for me? - No. - Sure you don't? Come on, give it up! Cough it up. - Been really slow. - What are you tryin' to pull here? There should be an extra 20. - You, open up that purse right now! I want everything inside of it. Don't look at me, look in your purse. Open it up! Hurry up, I'm gonna wear you. - Kitty. You should know better. Looks like a john stood you up. - Oh God. - Oh, dude, what the fuck? Ow, my nuts. Did you see that? - I think she broke my dick. - Wait, did you do that? - Everything I've worked for. - What is it? - Did you see that? Cutter's been spotted downtown! I don't are where you are! Get your ass down there. You! You're done, you psychotic piece of shit. - Stabbed this dude, and there was all this blood, and he just walks away! - I hope you like the taste of pavement, madman. - That's the guy! Holy shit, - what happened? What the fuck? - Yeah? - So, did you get it? - Cutter's dead. It's over. - No, no, do you have the bag? - Yeah, I quit. - What! - Doesn't need to be found. - Are you kidding me? I need that bag! - Figure it out your damn self. I'm done. - I am not taking the fall! You... - Again, I quit. - Hey, hello? - Nothing puts up a W, like the other team leaving town. Janet? - Breaking news now from downtown, where a major fire has broken out at a landmark 54-story building. You are now seeing the first images that we have received from the scene. This fire broke out just minutes ago, and has yet to be contained. - We here at KMOC 5 continue to follow developments. Eyewitnesses on the scene say the fire is only getting worse. We will provide details as they become available. - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Where'd you get that bag? - I found it. - Hey, how much you want for it, huh? - This? - How much? Damn! - You missed? What are you doing? Get me the fuckin' launcher. - I'm sorry! - Oh look at this runny piece of shit right here. - Hey, Holmes. - You know what we do to turds? We flush 'em! - Knock his bollocks off. Bullseye. What about the bag, though. - Fuck it, who cares? - Nothing to see here. Nothing to see here. Back up! You, with the phones, now. - What are you trying to hide? Where's the bodies? - Get out of here. Put the phone down! - God damn it. Are you fucking retarded? We're not here to play in this shit, pick it up, get it off the fuckin' sidewalk already. Christ! - Are you kidding me? It's 115 degrees out here. We're not getting paid overtime for this shit. - With the smell of charred flesh still in the air, this reporter... Brad, I can't. Just, just cut. - I wanna get out of here. Can you give me one more? I beg you, just one more and we can pack up and go. - One more. One more. You get one more, and that's it. Three, two, Natalie Hershlag reporting live on scene from the most recent death in a day that seems straight out of a horror film. - Officer Malka, what about this? - That's definitely evidence. Box. - With the smell of charred flesh still in the air, this reporter has seen her fill of death, which leaves us wondering who will be next, and could it be you? - Well, I don't know about you, Janet, but I'm thinking about moving to a smaller market. Preferably something with less face-stabbings. I'm out. I'm taking my mug.
