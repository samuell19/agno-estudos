Hey. Hey. Palace, hi. Hey Anselm. Rose. Y'all ain't gotta be in the doorway like that. Come sit down. Mmm, orange wine. Mm, it's good. It's not that good. Want some food? No, I'm good. Hi Palace. Hey. Hey Hans. - What's up, M? - Hey. How you feeling? I'm nervous. There's no reason to be nervous. This is for you. This is typically uneventful, you know, unless. Ha. You have nothing to worry about. Let's get started. It's been interesting having you in the sculpture department. Your ticket really came up, didn't it? So Palace, we're here to obviously talk about you, your work, accomplishments and struggles. I think also how we've seen you change over the last three summers and also in your project. 'Kay, cool. Yeah? Okay, great. Well I'm gonna give a little introduction. I actually wrote something about your work, so I'm gonna read this first. "In Palace's work, the impossible trajectory of hope becomes the ground where irony and advice dance together in frightening hallways alive with languor and vitality. Screenland is the underground and overlay for consciousness in Palace's work with consciousness understood as being made of multiple entry and exit points filled with voices and their shapes, exerting and relieving pressure on that question of how to live in all kinds of amazing and fucked up ways. Palace's materials are whatever she needs them to be, ultimately being themselves and part of the whole at the same time and fluidly." So. Thank you. There's a pedagogical impulse in your work, Palace, that's blocked by your compulsion. Sometimes it manifests as attraction, sometimes aversion. You're afraid of your own appetite. I see it, you know? It's all a bit polite, isn't it? That's actually a question. Oh, um. I don't know. You're always trying to prove you've done the homework. You know, fuck the homework. I love the way Fred Moten talks about impropriety. There's a richness, you know? And a kind of creativity in your longing. You know, you have to own it. It's fucking amazing what you've done the past three years. You work hard. You work harder than anyone I've ever met and you make it look fun. Mmh. Thank you, Hans. Well don't misunderstand me, Palace. I think it has to be about the recovery of your appetite, you know? And the need not to know yourself. "The need not to know yourself." Yeah, like Glissant. You know, "The need not to know yourself." Uh, okay. You know, I think everyone here goes a little too easy on you. Mm-mmm, that's not what's happening. No. From my vantage point, there are a lot of female artists your age, your generation, your race that are making a lot of sculpture like this. Hunter/gather sculpture here, found materials there, appropriated photography. How are you going to differentiate yourself? I don't know yet. I'm thinking of your long-term career and where are you gonna go with this? Wherever I wanna go. Let's talk about the thesis, yeah? 'Kay. "The Testimony of a Dead Daughter", what is that? I'd actually never heard of the author. Oh. That's Colette Thomas. She was a actress for Artaud, Artood. - Artaud. - Artaud, yeah. Artaud, yeah. She was a actress. She would like recite his poems and stuff and then they had like a crazy falling out and she wrote like a manifesto. Yeah, I'ma just read you a part real quick. Lemme get up. Gimme like one second. Think I wanna read that to y'all. Oh, this is it. "Science in the sky are emptying. Theater is conceived. Drama is the representation of the world at its stop point." Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, that's it. I mean we artists you know, we're all just part of one conversation. Big one. You know, what is reality and how do we contribute to it, right? What's truth or what's a lie? Better than that, what's truth and what's memory and the archive and what's the difference between them, right? Like I think what matters and what's unique is your contribution to how to render that truth. Well there's something very frightening about one's own appetite. You know, this is what Glissant offers: a way to witness the unseeable. You know, ultimately you know, you can change the future and the past. So what is your project? I don't know yet. Infinite possibilities. That's why I'm here, right? - But where do you wanna go? - To figure it out. You know, you can do whatever you want whenever you want. Like you know, there's no one to stop you now. But it seems like you want me to know that's not what Glissant says. He says to accept the unknown in others and in myself. I just wanna take a second to acknowledge how much Palace has accomplished over the last three years. Okay. What if there were actually no people in the work? You mean. You mean Black people. No, no. I don't mean that. I mean it's all just so figurative. It's just a family, right? Like this is a family. It's your family. It's just about your family. Okay. I'm a dead daughter because I lost my mother. Haven't you read Saidiya Hartman? Of course I'm responding to the African desperate. Staking my claim to opacity. Where'd you grow up? West Side, Chicago? Rose, you just being racist at this point. No, people like that. Okay. Let's talk about the work and y'all stop making me the work. 'Cause this is work. Hey, does everybody have enough fucking wine? This is getting heavy. You bought this hair? Rose, you know I bought that hair. I didn't make it myself. But you found this. I found it. Yeah, I did find it. Palace. Well congrats, Palace. You're a master of fine arts. That's it? That's it. You're free. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Good luck with everything, Palace. Really great to work with you. I'm sure we'll be seeing each other around. Take care. Congratulations, Palace. Great job. One more time. - One more time. - You made it. Now it's all over. Rose is like- Yes. - No, I know. - You saw. - You saw that. - Yeah, I saw that. Okay. Just making sure I'm not crazy. No, no. - All right. - It's a thing. Okay then. Well I'll see you later? I'll see you later. Okay. Palace. Palace. Hey, what's up? Did you have your review? Yeah, it just ended. How'd it go? They passed me. Fern, what do you want? Well where are you going? I was gonna find something nice to do for myself. Right now? Yeah. I guess you need it. What do you want? I mean can I come with? No, I wanna be alone. I guess I understand. Oh wait, Palace. I forget, are you allergic to tree nuts or peanuts? Girl, what? Well you're going to the party later. Let's hang. I'm not going to the party. Why? I thought like when are you leaving? Fern, I'll talk to you later. Hey. Thank god it's you. Are you crying? No. No. I'm just done. Aw. I'm done. Let's go to the lake. Hannah, I gotta pack. Ah, the lake first. It's more important. We need it. Okay. After the lake it's a wrap for me. But jealousy is a disease and I hope that bitch gets well soon 'cause that was crazy. I said not a goddamn thing. Oh, the kombucha store. You know, I saw this yesterday. I wanted to go there. Hannah, you said you was gonna go with me to the kombucha store and now all of a sudden you about to go by yourself? Okay, I see where your loyalty lies. Is it really his house? Girl, you know Liam got quiet people money. I don't know. That might just be his straight-up house 'cause Liam buying like property and shit. You brought food? Yeah, in Mason jars. Oh period. We love a Mason jar queen. Yes, but with the peaches it's good. How's your mom doing? Not good. I gotta go home. It's hard being eldest daughter. My brother is in Missouri. He could easily go up there. But nope. That's your job. Yeah, that shit on the phone the other day like pissed me off talking 'bout we need to talk about mom. Like shut your ass up, Jordan. Doesn't he know we're dead daughters? Says something about that. "Let the mothers speak about their suffering to those who are whores and aborted and completely sterilized. Let the holy virgin veil her face and withdraw she who hasn't been prostituted then glorified but respected then made pregnant by the Holy Spirit. For the women of our era not elected but condemned." Whore. I'm tired though 'cause she's not getting any better. What is lupus exactly? It's like your body doesn't know what's good for it or what's bad for it so it can mistake a good thing for a bad thing and the body attacks itself. It can make your hair fall out, your skin color change. Aw. It can give you arthritis. My mom can't really walk that well. I'm sure it's so hard being away from her. That's life. I can deal with life. I'm used to chaotic-ass stressful situations, but out here you just like can't deal with it. It's like everyone's in your fucking business. It's 20 fucking questions. It's very "Cruel Intentions". The drama. Oh. Said this earlier. "Drama is the representation of the world at its stop point." I mean people out here really want me to get mad and it's like I don't wanna fight you. Some things are worth fighting for. I'll beat that ass. But I think there's some things in life that are bigger than art. It's like out here people are like, "This is it. This is your life." And I'm like, "This isn't it. This isn't my life. And if you think it's my life, I really don't know what to tell you." I think the art itself is important too. It comes to represent those relationships and connections to each other but also to life. I'm a believer in art, a true believer. You're supposed to be here. I'm glad I know you. Aww, Hannah. But I'm not gonna play you, Hannah. I fucking hate it here. It sucks. I'm gonna get in. Do you wanna come? No, the way you go in is scary. I just like to float. There could be like a alligator up in there. There are no alligators here. You don't know that. I actually do. You seen Lake Placid? There's like a mythical creature in there. - Loch Ness. - Yeah. And it's gonna like snatch me up. I'll get in in a minute. What time are you going to the party tonight? Nope. Mm-mmm. I'm not going to the party. I'm on the train first thing tomorrow morning back to the city. So soon? Hannah, I gotta get home. Yeah, but we could go for like an hour. We have to celebrate being art masters. Shit, art dommes. Where are our subs? Need some help. Maybe it'll fall from the sky. Yeah, I'ma be like, "Clean this house. Wash these clothes." Aren't you DJing tonight? I'm supposed to be. Oh shit. Hey boo. Hey angel. How did it go? Wait, lemme put my headphones in. Fuck it. You on speaker. How did it go? Eh. - You? - Rose said something like, "You're asking me to care about your feelings." She asked me why I have people in my work. She's very French. Ain't she from San Diego? You know what I mean. "What do you think of Bataille? Have you not read him?" I need some sugar run. I gotta pack. Please, please, please! I need you! Girl, calm down. I need you! Okay? Seriously, come. We can get ready for the party together. I'm not going to the party. What? We can talk about this on the way there. Don't take too long. Hey Palace. Hey, what's up? Not too much. What you reading? Fred Moten "Undercommons". You read this? Yeah, I read it like last year. I read it last year. You liking it so far? Yeah, it's good. It's good. Oh, all right. What you up to? I'm about to go see what crazy Aidan up to. - Okay. - That's what I'm up to. I'll talk to you later. Talk to you. Aidan! Aidan. Bonjour, coeur couer. Bonjour, bonjour, bonjour. - Bonjour. - What's this? What's what? You putting that in the car or you putting it in the trunk? I'm putting it in the back seat. All right. Yay. Yes. It's time. All right, let's go. So why aren't you going to this party? Don't roll your eyes at me. Wait, watch me again. I spent all summer with these fools. I'm done. Not another night. ♪ Back to life ♪ ♪ Back to reality ♪ ♪ Back to life ♪ ♪ Back to reality ♪ I know you don't wanna miss the most maj, maj bash of the summer. No 'cause that's what you said about wedding which I found beaucoup underwhelming. I said what I said. Purr. ♪ What is life ♪ ♪ What is reality ♪ ♪ What is life ♪ Anyway, don't blame the lesbians for the faulty upstate supply chain. Attempting a raw bar for over 300 people when you clearly don't have two pennies to rub together, like what? Why though? Our inheritance is utopia. I'm done going to events that don't cater to my basic human needs. It was kinda maj though. The drama. Just come tonight. What if somebody unexpected comes out of the woodwork? Girl, he had all summer. Nothing. Why can't he just be cute though? It can be, mama. Why are you giving me these? Because I'm gonna party tonight. Yeah, I'm gonna suck one dick. I'm gonna tweak four nipples and snort multiple lines of pharmaceutical-grade ecstasy. Uh-uh. Aidan, you nasty. I love you, boo. I'll see you later. Love you too. See you later. - Punishment? - Yeah. Yeah, so they like drop like this person in the middle of I don't know like the Arctic. Which person? Is what I still don't know. Like an outdoors person. Who is it? Palace. Yo. Congrats. Can we come in? Yeah, c'mon. Oh my god. What's good? Hi HotJake. Hi Akin. So you coming to this party later? Mm-mmm. No. Can I hit that? - Mm-hmm. - Cool. Here. I heard the first years went all out on decorations. Oh, word. That's what you heard? - Word. - That's what you heard. Actually got some small batch mezcal in here. - Lemme see. - If you're down. Yeah, I'm down. - Yeah? - Yeah, fuck it. That's have some. Ooh. Let's see. - Okay. - HotJake. Sick titties hat. Okay, HotJake. It's a nice color. All right well, to us. To us. Cheers. Ooh. Hot. I would maybe be a zebra. I'd definitely be a koala 'cause apparently they're like the dumbest animals in the kingdom. Oh my god, this conversation is dumb. But is it like a nickname you gave yourself? I gave HotJake that nickname. No, Jake. Stop lying. You're HotJake because I gave you that nickname. When did you give him that nickname? Like a few summers ago. Huh. Yeah. Cool. I like how you're thinking of the framing of commodity here. Kinda reminds me of "Mushroom at the End of the World". I was thinking about the hierarchies of sentience. Your window displays, they do the same thing I think. But I mean my work is more about hyperobjects than the dominance of capitalism. But you could count industrialism as a hyperobject if you think of it as the dawn of the anthropocene. Have you heard of Sylvia Wynter? No. S-Y-L-V-I-A space. W-Y-N-T-E-R. Check her out. Is she a Black woman? Yeah. Why? Oh, speaking of mushrooms. Anyone want some? - Yes. - Yes. Bit for you. - Thank you. - Want some? Wait, how you do it? You just put a little bit here. Bit much. What're you gonna wear tonight, Palace? I'm not going to the party. Oh whoa, wait. I have the most amazing dress. Wanna borrow it? I'll borrow a dress from HotJake. Yeah. C'mon, you're gonna borrow it. Got a dress. He's got one for you. I'm gonna put some music on, huh? If you don't go to the party, what are you gonna do? Oh, I'm gonna go to Liam's. Quiet, little quiet night or whatever. You know, tuck up, drink some wine, smoke some weed. And then you're gonna go to the party after that. And I'm not gonna go to the party. And I'll see you at the party. Drink some wine, smoke some weed, dance a little bit. Aidan, I'ma just talk to you later. I'ma talk to you later. Where you at? Come over. Here it is. Check this thing out, Palace. Huh? You're gonna look so fire in this. What the fuck is this? Try it on. - I'm not about to try it on. - Come on, try it on. - No. - Try it on. Try it on. Try it on. Try it on. Try it on. Try it on. Try it on. Try it on. Try it on. Try it on. Try it on. Shut up! Shut up. I'm not gonna try it on right here. Okay. Liam, where are you? Oh, I snuck through your window. I'm with Kieran. Ew, girl. He is not gonna fuck you. We don't know that. But we do though. Just yesterday he was telling me about his homosexual fantasies. Enough with your homosocial agenda. I gotta do my laundry. Shut up. You like fuck boys just as much as I do. I'm attracted to fuck boys because I am a fuck boy. It's like I'm compulsively drawn to that which disgusts me in myself. Or you just think he's hot and you wanna fuck. Week eight. Are you gonna let Ezra eat your pussy? Ew, stop talking nasty. He's into threesomes. You know that people who're into threesomes fuck good. Stop. And I saw his dick in the bathroom. - It's thick. - I'ma hang up on you. Bodega candle thick. I'm serious. Anyway, there's a face mask. I left some food in the fridge. It's all there for you. Make yourself at home. Thank you. And there's some nice wine. You can have that too. Love you. Bye. Her semi-nude body was discovered along a secluded footpath known locally as the Black Pad. Shut the up. Wee. Hi, welcome to the Palace Channel and today I'm gonna be showing you a night look. So what I did was I already washed my face, I did my jade roll, put my lip balm on. Of course, can't go anywhere without sunscreen. It is a must. So then once I did all that, what we're gonna do is we're gonna start on the eyes. Into the waterline. Don't be afraid to get in there. But I'm not like most girls, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna mix that with some gray and just don't be afraid, you know? Makeup should be fun. I like having fun. Look how pretty this is. So pretty. That's so pretty. Wow. That's the mistake that I see a lotta people making is they don't put on eye shadow when their eyes are open. It's just something I notice. It's not something you gotta change. What I'm really gonna focus on since I don't wear that much makeup is get in there just a little. And then I know a lotta people like to use a sponge. I don't do that. Some people would think this color's too dark. But I know it's looking crazy right now, but I'll show you in a minute how I make it work. Oh shit. Just if you fuck up, like don't be afraid to make mistakes. It's all about making mistakes with makeup. That's how you learn what you like. A wiggle, wiggle. Not everybody has, umm. I've been told I have nice lips. It is what it is. You can't get here unless you know how to work this. Lemme stop talking and get this together. Yo, I'm here. Where are you? What? You're supposed to be DJing right now. Yeah, I'm on my way. No, you're not. I'm walking over right now. Okay. Bye. Bye. And as the French would say, "Voila." Take your hair down and just really embrace who you are which is not me. Hello? Hello. Hey, what's up? Do you know who this is? No, I don't. Who is this? I thought you saved my number. Who is this? You sound busy. Who is this? Oh. Hi. I thought we were gonna hang out this evening. You never told me that. Well are we gonna hang out tonight? I don't know. I thought you were DJing the party. I got an email about it. Yeah, I'm like five minutes away. - Damn. - Okay, cool. I'll see you soon. Bye. "On this day, I have imbibed wines the color of grapefruit, tasted the finest cheeses of all the land, sweets and spices you can't imagine. Thank you for hospitality and care, my man. I emerge from your home with clean garments and cleaner privates. I return to the kingdom of Illinois tomorrow's eve. It has been a pleasure and an honor. Until we meet again. Love, Palace." Hey Palace. Hey. Palace. Hey Portia. I thought you weren't coming. I'm here now. Okay, well this party needs a little help. Come here. Yo Palace, you wore it. Yeah. You look amazing. Thanks, boo. Aren't you supposed to be DJing? Yeah, you wanna hear something better? Yeah. Please. - Lemme put on my playlist. - What? Let me log into my playlist real quick.

It does match my dress. It's bright red. Wait, that reminds me. We never did a studio visit. Okay? Let's do a studio visit now. You wanna do a studio visit right now. Yeah. Come with me. Let's go. Okay. Oh, don't touch me right there. Should we get outta here? I thought we were gonna do a studio visit. Do you need a ride home? Um. Well I have Aidan's keys because I have her car. Right. And I could go back with Hannah because me and Hannah live together or I could go back with Fern because Fern and Aidan live together. Right. Why? What're you gonna do? Well I'm thinking of taking off. Do you wanna stay here now? You tired? A little bit. Oh. Well thanks for the drink. Sure. Okay. So you just wanna stay? Yeah. Why not? Okay. I saw that. What are you still doing here? What happened? I'm shy. I'm nervous. I'm so ugly when I got crush on somebody. Making like the stupidest faces. Why don't you just tell him you wanna have sex with him? Oh no. I don't know. Well I thought you were gonna be a sex guy tonight. I thought you was gonna be a sex guy tonight. - Where's Kieran? - Shh! Girl, calm down. - Kieran! - Shh! Where is his Jordan Cat a la no head-ass? Oh. You don't want me to talk about Ezra. That fucking guy. Don't start this conversation. But can that nigga read for real? You could tell me, Hannah. 'Cause I've had sex with men who like straight up be reading with their fingers. Yes, he can read. Okay 'cause he mentioned. "To Kill a Mockingbird" for his thesis? It's a classic American tale. Hannah, I'm no scholar but that's a children's book. Okay. So wait, what happened with Ezra, that big dumb dog? Either I choked, he choked. Somebody choked. Stay, stay. Good boy. Good boy. Come get your treat. Okay, Hannah. Hey. Hi. Looking good, baby. It's so good to see you here. You're fabulous. So glad you came. Looking like a goddamn snack. I'ma bite the shit outta you. Have you seen Hannah? I was literally just with Palace. It's so dark in here I can't see nobody. I need to find her. We're leaving together. Bitch! Found her. Found her. Oh and you're Venus Taurus. So there is sort of this combination that happens when I'm with you guys of sort of lightness and darkness. Portia and I'm sort of holding the space in between. Portia. Yes, my love? Do you have an Android charger? Android, no. Sorry, babe. - But you know what? - All good. I think we can ask that guy Akin or whatever if he's in the studio next door. Yeah. Hannah, these are beautiful. These are so beautiful. Taryn, aren't these gorgeous? Look. Thank you. Bring me the friendship between solving and dissolving. I'm so glad you like them. They're just from Blythewood. My thanks for picking up that spray foam for me last week. Oh. Look, Hannah. I would literally jump off a bridge for you. I love you. I pick them every night after crits. Wildflowers, black-eyed Susans. You are so grounded. Are you a Taurus? - No. - No. Weird. Do you want some? No, it's okay. Palace? What's up? Do you want some? It is really fucking good ket. Have I done K before? No, you haven't and you shouldn't start tonight. Okay. That's impossible. I'm sure you've done Ketamine at this point in history. But if you haven't, you should try it 'cause you'd love it. - Okay. - Okay. How much should I take though? Well how much have you had to drink? Like? Oh no, no, no. It's fine. You just can't be like drunk. This is how I do it. I take my finger and I put it in the bag and then I put it on my tongue like this. Okay. Like that and then like... But Portia for real, I'ma need you to gimme a phone charger. Uh-huh. Palace, let's just breathe. Okay. Oh my god. - What's up? - Palace. You look like an angel. Oh, thank you. Don't you have to get up early tomorrow? I'm good. Portia, I'm so happy we spent time together this summer. I really enjoyed it. Oh, I am so glad to know you. You know what? This is really reminding me of my Nicaraguan family that I'm currently financially supporting. Oh yeah. You told me about them. Yes, I met them in Gillette Square after I was visiting my grandmother that I don't love talking about - because of inherited trauma. - Shh, don't talk about her. But I was in this park and I saw this gorgeous little girl and she was just so beautiful and she was by herself. And I said, "How can that girl ever be alone again?" No one should be alone. Let's go to Liam's. Oh. It was nice to meet you. Yeah, we're gonna go. Okay, loves. You stay here. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Bye. Bye. Once again, I'm the bad guy. And then again, just sort of it is what it is. You know, I don't know. I mean that's true. And you know, I do honestly kinda like him. But the reality is I don't really wanna - you know, relate to him. - Hey. What were you guys doing? I have presents for us. Oh my god. Shit. Do you know that in rehab? - No. - You mean now? Yes, out-patient. That's a rough one. T, M and Brent broke up. - No. - Yes, they did. Nine years. And they were so unhappy for like the last half of it. So sad. I mean but you have to stay true to your feelings because Muva does not speak to everyone. - But when she speaks though. - But when she does. We must listen. I mean I know one Hans has been fucking Since the first year. No, no. No, no, no, no. Not my Hans. She's not from Belarus. She's from Las Vegas. East Las Vegas. East Las Vegas. - Aww. - She's not that cute. She's not that cute. She's just a white girl. A mousey little white girl who talks in a baby voice. I'd never be a burden to you. Hannah. Pass me that mini cupcake. She's not that interesting. Hannah. White women voted for Trump. That's all I'm saying. I hate white women. - Girl, go for it. - Portia. Tell us what you think. I am Jewish. I am Italian. - Of course. - That's the truth. She's not a liar. When are you going to Venice? Oh, I don't know. I gotta go home. Okay, but you're in the Venice Biennale and you don't know when you're going or might not even go? It be's that way sometimes. Well you have to go by November. If you don't go by November, it could quite possibly be underwater and fucking global warming, I think or something. Well what are you doing? I mean no shows, thank god. Seth and I are going to Maine for a couple weeks with his parents which will be whatever. But then after that, we're going to Greece and that's what I'm stoked on. Because Greece end of season just is like fucking perfect. Fucking perfect. Sounds nice. I've been meaning to ask do you have a gallery in New York yet? Mm-hmm. 'Kay, because I was trying to tell you that I think that you should be showing with. If you need to connect, I've been working with. She's kinda phenomenal. Doesn't she do? Don't she do at night? Yeah, she does at night. Yes, she does at night, but she's worked really hard. It wasn't easy for her and you know that she's like really good and just go for it. - Speaking of - at night, look at this. Pass it around. Pass it around. Wait, don't you have a phone charger? No, I don't have a phone charger. It's an Android, absolutely not. Get an iPhone. Show me. It's my turn. Wait, I was gonna ask- Fern, I don't even want to show you. Are you an S corp on LLC? What's an S corp? Okay, so S corp, LLC. Don't be an LLC. S corp's gonna give you way better savings. I'm gonna introduce you to my accountant. She's gonna take care of everything. Let me do it with you. Oh okay. Calvin Klein. First coke. Save it. Don't give Palace anymore. Hannah. Palace. Hannah, seriously. Hannah about to go, y'all. - Oh. - All right, goodbye. Hi Kieran. Oh, Hannah wanna stay now? Hannah wanna stay. Hannah wants to stay. Don't touch that please. Dude, chill. It was my dad's. C'mon. You so goofy. I'm goofy? Yeah. We were doing fine 'til the straight man showed up. I'm not straight. Okay. I'm queer. Shut up. Is that coke? Yeah, it's just so hot. Lemme get the a/c on. No. It's K. Are you okay? You did all this this summer? Damn. Okay. Go off, Kieran. I see you. I'm not gonna play. Looking kinda reckless up in here. I didn't know you was into Ruff Ryder shit. See this? It's disingenuous. No. Palace? Thank you. How so? The yellow's bullshit. I don't buy it. There are no stakes. You're not even in the work. So obvious you're holding back. What are you afraid of? Well right now I'm feeling very vulnerable about the work. That's how you're supposed to feel. That's your job. It's gotta come from your gut. Have you read Isabella Graw? Kieran, you can read? I forget the name of the text, but I like what she says about populism and exchange value. I wanna redistribute wealth by questioning how and what we value. That's what I like about crypto. It's best compared to patents, but it's completely new. It's ours. And by participating in communities, we create real value: capital. This? This is anti-painting painting disrupting the flow of capital. With painting? Kieran, these are beautiful. I'm so mad I never seen your work before. You be hiding shit like me. It's abstract. You're full of shit. You're so full of shit. I'ma get a drink. Dillon, you got a light? No, man. You know I don't smoke. You guys know what I mean when I'm talking about like liberalism. It's dead, dude. Like it's just like not even- Um, you got a light, dude? No. You got a light? Palace, what's good? Hey HotJake. What? How come we never hung out this summer? I don't know. We hanging out right now though. Yeah, but like hang out. I'm gonna get some water. Wait, wait, wait. Don't drink too much of that. Stop. What? That was molly water. Whoa! I'm gonna kill you. Palace, you have some anger issues. Portia. I'ma be sick. I'ma throw up. Baby, here. Palace, you're gonna be so high. Okay. Just move through it. - Mm-hmm. - It's a gift. Let's go to the waterfall. Okay, perfect. Portia. Do you have a phone charger? Oh babe, you have asked me that like a hundred times. Literally, I don't. Please don't ask me again. You're right. You're right. Okay, come in. I'm not getting wet alone. Is it cold? It feels amazing. You have to come in. Come in. Come on. - Portia? - Mm-hmm. You see that? What? The beautiful colors. Oh. What was that? - What? - That noise. - Oh my god. Oh my god. - What? Portia, what? Oh my god, it was a beast. Don't play. That's not funny. Wait, no. But for real, do you hear that? What? Oh my god. - Girl. - Oh my god. What? Oh my god. - Oh shit. - Oh my god. I know your husband! No, Portia. Come on. Let's go. Go, go, go. Water's so heavy. I know. It's so heavy. I like can't get out. Oh my god. Look, I'm like a beech. Like I'm like oh my god. Have you ever seen like "The Blue Lagoon"? - Like I'm like Brooke Shields. - Is that a reality show? No, it's this fucked up movie from the '80s. Whoa. Oh my god. Hey. I heard you on WNYC the other day. Yeah, that was cool. Do you listen to popular music? Huh? Have you ever heard of Lil Uzi Vert? Yeah. I'm familiar. You know, he's a really intelligent young man. I was listening to this very compelling interview between Uzi and Terry Gross on "Fresh Air" the other day. What an interesting life he's had. What's "Fresh Air"? Hunter. Hunter. Yeah, what's up? You got a light? No, I don't think it's a problem. Hold on one sec. Yo, can I get a hit? Cheers. Hey bitch. It's like the motherfuckin' Palace Show. Tune in. Bitch, how are you always trying to fight me? Guess what, I went to Venice. It sucked. I wanted to like it, but I know you phoned it in. Fern, you're touched. This is why I don't fuck with you anymore. Don't send me any more text messages talking about the sky is falling. You used me. Hit me, bitch. I wish you would. I'm not playing with you, Fern. Who cares what they have, Palace? They all want you dead anyways. You know what, Fern? You showed your ass in Chile. 'Cause who the fuck plans an international trip and then not show up? Hurt my goddamn feelings with that one, bitch. It's all about you. It's no one else's responsibility. You want these hands? You get these hands, okay? I do this shit for sport. Just like this annoying-ass person that I cannot stand no more. Skinny, stupid, scrawny-ass bitch. Fuck you, Fern. Hey. You good? I was. Yeah, I'm decent. Yeah, I was wondering where you went. I was looking for you, handsome. You wanna go for a ride in my convertible? You have a convertible? No, but I wanna take you for a ride. Oh, I can't. I leave tomorrow. Come and we can go to Twin Lakes tomorrow. No, I leave tomorrow. So this is it? Are you okay, Palace? Decisions. Bad. Do you want me to take you home? Mm-mmm. Stay. No, no. Stay. It's whatever, man. I don't feel safe leaving you like this. Stay. Shit. Had to get out. That set was just a fucking mess. I wish I could go back and just- Akin. Rearrange the playlist. I didn't play any of the right songs. No one liked. It's fine. - Akin. - Gotta get outta the woods. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. - Just please. God, Jesus. - Akin. He's not even that hot. He's just white. Such fucking bullshit. So annoying. - So ready to done. - Wow, boy. Maybe I should. These nails are kinda long. I like this ring though. It looks nice. Fuck. Boop. Angel. Good morning. Good morning, Ezra. How are you feeling? What do you want? You were out last night. Okay. I put you in the car. You were passed out on the pavement. Thank you for putting me in the car, sure. But why are you in the car? I wanted to just wake up together. Nigga, you don't know me. What do you mean wake up together? I don't know you, but I like you. Well. Well? Last day. Yeah, it is the last day. So why would you wait 'til the last day to like make a move? Like what you thought this was? I made a move last night, but you didn't seem like you were into it. When? You don't remember? When we were making out in the hallway, I pulled you in. You got ticklish. We had a laugh. That weak-ass make out session. That's some eighth-grade shit. I like you, Palace. Don't fucking touch me. Did you ask? Did you say, "Can I touch you?" No. Wait, what? Ezra. I'ma be real with you. You been pissing me off all summer 'cause you do that wave and shit. You don't do anything. Just hi. You just wave. And now I'm supposed to be like, "Oh my god. He stared at me all night. He picked me up." Like bro, I'm Palace Bryant. I'ma be good. You could a left me there. I'm fine. I would've woken up and drove my ass home. I didn't want you to be alone when you woke up not knowing where or how you got here. Okay 'cause you just such a fucking nice guy, right? I'm not saying that. I thought it was the right thing to do. You're a bitch. So that's all you're gonna say? "You're a bitch, this. Why'd you wait 'til the end?" All of that. Yes, Ezra. 'Cause ain't nobody asking you those questions. You think you a fucking catch. You're not and you're not special. I'm special. - No one's- - What movie are you in? I don't know. Missed connections, huh? What? What? Oh my god. Fuck me or get out the car. What? "What?" Fuck me or get out the car. You're just gonna mock me the whole time? You think that's gonna turn me on? - Yup. - Yeah. And away we go. Fuck me or you're racist. Are you okay? 'Cause you're kissing a Black girl, you think you're not racist? What does that have to do with anything? You just gagged me. Do it again. Harder. Okay again. Three. This is three. Mm-hmm, I can count. - Four. - Three. Oh, this? Hi. Can you do that? That weak-ass bark. You don't know how to play. Maybe I don't. You don't. Where you going? Ezra? What? Get the fuck out. That's it? Yeah, that's it. Get out. Come on. "Dear Kulu and Grayling, I hope you have been enjoying your summer in Europe. It is important for a young lad to travel and expand his or her mind. Yes, you can be a lad and a her. Learn about it. Anyway, enclosed in this dusty drawer are the house keys.
