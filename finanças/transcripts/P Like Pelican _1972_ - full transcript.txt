They once came off it and now they are back again. What a liability! Go away! What do you want? Go away! What's in calling my name? Why do you keep calling my name? What do you want? (Singing with a local accent) Alef (akin to A) like my name... Agh Mirza (Mr. Mirza). This way! This is A. B e (Akin to B). This way! like the bad boys of Tabas! Bad! The bad boys of Tabas! Daal (akin to D). This way! (In chorus) Divouneh (Crazy)! I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy but there's crazy like me! These people of Tabas address me as crazy. They only speak out the word, crazy! But there's no craziness in me! What does crazy mean? Perceptive! I'm percep... I'm not imperceptive but perceptive. I'm not crazy. These very mean people of Tabas have named me Crazy. I'm one of the perceptive in Tabas. I'm not crazy. What does crazy mean? Crazy means a stupid person. I own perception. I read poems. I compose poems. I own perception. What does crazy mean? Calling me crazy is so bad. Wingless sparrow, if falls from his nest... will fall into the trap of a no good, that unfortunate innocent! From the father's beak, he has been fed loving y... a no-good feeds him obligatorily... If he decides to wing, to fly beneath the sky... he won't be allowed and his wings will be clipped. The wingless sparrow was me to the world... got beaned by the world here and there... Orphan from father at the age of 3 months old inopportune! In the midst of a depraved group of people... My poor mother helpless, jobless and simple... With unwarranted people who are astray from rightness... Who can do as best among such a society! One ought to be patient waiting for God's mercy... As one's own mother, be patient with what's preordained. Seyyed Ali Mirza! That's enough of rage and anger! Kaaf (akin to K in English)! Like the one who sits on the ground and stretches his legs! And a branch... a branch of a tree... a branch of a tree over his head stretched that way! There is another kind of Kaaf! Another type is laying face... this way! This way! Your toes down. Now we had two types of Kaaf's. There are some words like Kaafar (meaning atheist in English). Like Kaafar! Like my Kaafar uncles (from father's side) Who were apparently Muslims but they were real Kaffar! Kaafar! That's it about Kaaf! Ch-e (akin to ch (sound in English)! This way! Underneath is like Noon (akin to N in English). That's it about Ch-e! Like Chehel (meaning forty in English). Like I've been living in this slum for forty years. Chehel years. Taa (akin to strong t in English)! Like Tabas... where meets deserts and salty lands on its four sides. Tabas. P e (akin to p in English)! This way! Like... Pedarsag (an offensive word meaning "puppy")! Go away! Pedarsag! Go! Why Pedarsag? Can't any p found in other words, though? P e like pelican! What? P e like pelican! What's pelican? Come with me and let me tell you what it is. Do you remember Bagh-e. Go shan (Golshan Garden)? A bit, yes. Do you remember Hoz-e. Go shan (Golshan Pool)? Yes! Yes! I do remember something. There has come something from a long distance away farther than far! It's white in color like snow. It's quite soft like feather. It sounds like a dream! No. In the desert. In Tabas. It has no counterpart quite unique! So, is it like a dream? No. It resembles nothing! You should come and see. You should sit next to it. Tabas is not the same as it was forty years ago. There has come a pelican. Pelican! Pelican is cool! Pelican is kind. Like a man who is kind to another man? Yeah! Nope! I don't want it! I don't feel like it. It's not mine, though! If you step once in. Bagh e Golshan (Go shan Garden), next to Hoz e Golshan (Golshan Poo), you can't bear the thought of losing it. It belongs to another world! No! I don't want it. I haven't entered this town for forty years. Now, you want me to enter the town for you pelican? Find a P e in another word! I have waited for forty years. Again, now... now, again I keep waiting. Might he come by himself! Do you mean the pelican? It doesn't get out of water! It's cool! It's light! Won't you swear at me? Won't you stone me? Why are you in here treating me well? For that pelican! Cause he is so good. Cause he's so great. Let's go to him in Bagh e Golshan (Golshan Garden). Have these boys seen your pelican? Yeah, of course! All Tabas locals have seen it. Having it seen, they stone and swear at me and don't they learn their lessons? We' I talk soon! See you tomorrow. Collect your thoughts! You may dream again! I'm waiting. Sing! Sing... ♪ Maryam!

Appreciate them! I love these children. They are very nice. They are good boys. They are so polite. They are treating so well! So, he doesn't come! He was lying. He told me another lie! Forty years! He told me that he would come. I told him to come. I did nothing wrong! I have to keep waiting. If it's white, if it's soft, if it's very cool it should sounds like a dream. Hasn't he sent for me? Hasn't he found me? Haven't I grown old waiting? Then, he should arrive by now! Bagh e Golshan (Golshan Garden)? Hoz e Golshan (Golshan Pool)? Forty years in the slums! Seyyed Ali Mirza! Yes? The cab is waiting for you! I know that. Why are so late? Who's this? Is he from Tabas? Yeah! No. I'm not coming! C'mon! He's hard of hearing! He's mute. He only knows how to drive the cab to Bagh e Golshan (Golshan Garden). I believe in you. Not a trace of those bothersome people on the streets! What about on the road? No, man! See what part of the day it is! It's too hot! Not a single bird is flying in the sky! All crept in their holes! Come! Come on!
