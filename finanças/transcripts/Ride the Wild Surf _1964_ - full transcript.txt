NARRATOR: To a lot of guys, this may look like a jet plane. But to surfers, man, it's a flying carpet to the Promised Land: Hawaii. With a 10-mile stretch of beach on the North Shore of the island where the biggest, wildest waves in the world build up every winter, the clambake always starts late in December. And for two weeks, the best wave riders show from everywhere: California, Australia, New Zealand, even Portugal and Peru. Every one of them burning with the surf fever and hot to test themselves against the heavies at all the famous places like: Sunset Beach, Haleiwa, Makaha, the Bonzai Pipeline and the big daddy of them all, Waimea Bay. It sure doesn't look like much, does it? When it breaks, it'll look like plenty. Man, I've been hot to surf Waimea since I was 13. Ah, but the question is, can we do it without winding up in traction? You start thinking that way, and you won't go out at all. Don't worry about me, buddy. This may be the last chance I'll ever get. I'll be out there. So will I. NARRATOR: Things were pretty quiet at Waimea, all right. So the boys decided to move on down the road to Haleiwa where there was plenty of action. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Hail, hail, the gang's all here. Look at 'em go. CHASE: Hey, isn't that Russ? From Malibu? JODY: Yeah. STEAMER: Hey, you're not kidding. That's him, all right. Hoo. This is a regular summit meeting. Every top surfer in the world must be here. Isn't that the Eskimo there with Phil Davis? CHASE: It sure is. Old Ess doesn't seem happy with that board that Phil's made him. He ought to be. Phil's the best board maker there is. Who's that other guy? That's Frank Decker. CHASE: Not the one with the chicks, the one with the camera. Oh, uh, Charlie Mott. Oh, the showboat. That's him. Yeah. Look at those waves. Aren't they somethin'? Listen, we didn't come 3000 miles just to watch. Now how about we change in the car and shoot a couple ourselves? Uh, how about we wait awhile and figure the break, huh? A lot of guys are wipin' out, out there. Better than that, I know we can do. Come on. Brr. Hey, you ready? Just about. Be with you in a minute. Well, hurry it up, boy. (LAUGHING) Hey, Jody, Chase. So you guys came over to try the big stuff, huh? How you doing, Russ? You looked good out there. Ah, shapin' up. Do you guys know Ally Maloha and Swag Riley from Australia? How're you doin'? RUSS: Jody Wallis, Chase Colton. Hey, where you guys stayin'? We took a cottage over at Kawela Court. We're there, too. You're just in time for the big bash tonight. All the fish food you can eat for $1, and bring your own beer. CHASE: Good deal. It's a charity for poor Hawaiians. Namely him. Sounds great. We'll be there. Hey, take it easy out there. This isn't Malibu. Thanks, Grandma. Hey, we'll see you guys then? CHASE: All right. JODY: Bye, now. Take care. Thanks a lot. See you. Right. Well, we ready? Well, where's Steamer? I don't know. Hey, Steamer, come on! How! (WOLF WHISTLES) Hey, wait! How'd you make out, lover? I think we're in negotiation. I just made contact. Very good. Come on, let's go. (ALL CHUCKLING) Any action? Not yet. Hey, Jody, $1 says I stay higher in the curl than you. Okay, sucker, you got a bet. How about you, Chase? No, thanks. It's my head. I want to split it open very carefully. Have fun. Phew! (COUGHING) Boy. Wow, you know somethin'? This is a little different than Malibu. Maybe we ought to trade these things in on a couple of scuba tanks. Hey, here comes Chase. Watch him go right on his button. Not bad. Nothing to it, boys. All you got to do is grab a tame wave, knock off with the spinners, and you got it made. Oh, come off it. (ALL LAUGHING) All right. Let's go. So long, Steamer. Hey, Russ, who is that guy? That's Jody Wallis, one of the best small wave riders in California. This is his first year over here. He's got style, huh, Phil? Ha, ha, he may give you guys some competition. Are you kidding? My sister could look good at Haleiwa. Yeah, well, let's see what he does with those big waves before we start biting our nails. I found out who she is. Congratulations. Her name is Lily Kilua, and she lives on a little ranch a couple of miles. Well, why don't you mosey on down there and introduce yourself? Russ told me he heard a guy went up there last year and darn near caught himself a load of buckshot. What? How come? Well, the story goes the guy just drove up to say hi. Now, he didn't even get out of the car, and pow, the shot blew the skegs clean off the two boards he had on top. I've heard of girls playin' hard to get, but that... Yeah, if I were you, buddy, I'd, uh, take the hint. Oh, I don't know, she's really something. Hey, maybe she'll show up tonight. I can find out what's going on. (PEOPLE CHEERING) MAN 1: Hey, hey, go. (CROWD CHATTERING) MAN 2: There we go. Come on, Augie! Come on, Ally! (CROWD CHEERING) Boy, she really packs a wallop. MAN 1: Come on, Ally! Come on, Ally! ALL: Hey! Hey! MAN 1: Come on, Ally! What is she, some kind of a girl nut? A girl nut? Okay, Ivy League, maybe I can't lick Ally, but you, I can take. You can't be serious. Come on, come on out and get your lumps. What's goin' on here, man? This is worse than Muscle Beach. (ALL LAUGHING) There's no muscle in this. It's all up here. I'm going to think you to pieces. Say, that sounds like fun... At ease, friend. Ivy League's my pigeon. I think he's got a little more chicken in him than pigeon, Augie. (ALL LAUGHING) Looks like you're elected, Chase. Oh, this is ridiculous, I don't fight with girls. Oh, there's going to be no fight. Just a common, ordinary, everyday massacre. (ALL LAUGHING) You've got to be kidding. You want to come on out here and, uh, find out? Try it. Try it. ALL: Come on, let's go! Come on! (ALL CHEERING) Okay. Ahh! Ahh? Oh, this is silly. No, go on! (ALL LAUGHING) All right. (GRUNTING) (ALL CHEERING) AUGIE: Okay. Now repeat after me. Augusta Poole is not a girl nut. (CHUCKLING) Come on. Augie Poole is not a girl nut. (SIGHING) Aren't you going to say it? Come on, please say it, huh? Hey, don't stand on your victory too long, Augie. Gee, I'm sorry. I... It was just a joke. Be back after I get cleaned up. I guess maybe I am a girl nut. MAN ON RADIO: Now for the latest weather report. Come here a minute. Listen to this. The storm in the Aleutians that we mentioned earlier is reported to be mounting in intensity. Constantly being tracked by Navy weather planes, the report is that heavy ground swells are building and are heading southeasterly toward the Hawaiian group. It's expected that the storm will first hit the island of Oahu on the North Shore. Local boat owners are urged to stay tuned to this station so that we may bring you... What do you think, Russ? If it doesn't blow out, it'll be the beginning of the big waves, all right. Probably Haleiwa first and the other spots right behind it. What other spots? Well, you know, Sunset, Laniakea, Bonzai Pipeline, Makaha. What about Waimea? Depends on how big the storm gets. You know something? With my back trouble, I don't care if Waimea ever comes up. What's the matter with your back, baby? Ooh, right down here in the middle, honey. There's a great big streak of yellow. (ALL LAUGHING) Yeah, a lot of guys get that trouble when Waimea comes in. Hey, Russ, what's the biggest you've ever seen it? Oh, I've seen it close to 30 feet. 30 feet? Ooh, man, that's somethin' else. We'd better start out easy and work our way up, huh, Jody? You're not kiddin'. You don't work your way up to Waimea, fella. When it comes in, you either have it or you don't. Oh, well, I got it. At least I did the last time I looked. (ALL LAUGH) A lot of guys say that before the first ride, but not the last one. What last ride? Let me tell you about it, sport. It's kind of like King of the Mountain. Everybody keeps going for the best rides on the biggest waves till one by one, you either psyche out, get creamed, or quit. Whoever's left goes for one last ride on the wave, all alone. And that's what makes you King. What's so great about being King? Well, for one thing, there's getting to be some loot in it. Right, Ess? Yeah. You mean, there's a cash prize? No, not the way you mean. It's... Well... Well, tell them, Phil. Well, last year Eskimo burnt up every place from Haleiwa to the Pipeline. Then topped it off by gettin' the last ride at Waimea. So I put out a board with his name on it. We both did all right, didn't we, Ess? I'm not complaining. You got rocks in your head, Phil, if you think we'd go for the last ride just for the money. Well, what then? I'll tell you for what. Makes him feel big. That's right, hotshot. It makes us feel big. A lot bigger than you. CHASE: Yeah? Hi. When you didn't come back, I thought you might be hungry. Look, what do you want from me? Well, to apologize, mostly. All right, fine. Well, aren't you hungry? I...mean, I...I took the best parts of four lobster, and we could eat it right over there on that bench. Oh, I am so very sorry. All right, fine. Won't your, uh, won't your date be looking for you? I don't have one. I was showing a girlfriend of mine the island. We stopped by to see Ally Maloha, and he made us stay. I've known him since I was 10. There you go. Now, you got a light? Well, what are you going to do now? Set fire to me? For the candle. Ah, all right. What's your name? Chase Colton. Mine's Augie Poole. Yes, I know. Oh, you mustn't feel inadequate because I threw you. I'm a black-belter. Well, you'd make some lucky guy a wonderful bodyguard. What made you pick on me? Oh, I don't know. Because you looked so scrubbed and solid and superior... That you just couldn't resist shaking me up, huh? Uh-huh. Something like that. You go to school? Yeah, Colton College. What'd you say your name was? You heard it. Chase Colton. My grandfather endowed the land, and my father built a lot of the buildings. A darned good school, too. But I think I'll be transferring back East before long. Why? Because when your name is Colton, and you go to Colton College, the rest of the guys treat you like some kind of a freak. Ah, butter up to you, huh? No, just the opposite. I don't get it. Well, neither do I. I don't know, I think it's best I just pull out and go back East to school. Say, you know what you need? What? A good strong dose of Augie Poole. Really? I mean, it's the least I can do after nearly twisting your arm off. (LAUGHING) Let's drink to it. Chase Colton, two weeks from today, you're going to be a new man. (GASPING) Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that. That's all right. Don't worry about it. All I did was open the beer like this and--and... Oh! oh! oh! (ALL CHEERING) (ALL JEERING) (ALL LAUGHING) Steamer, the idea is to hit the pineapple. Look, I hit him in the foot, that's close enough. Bull's eye! A typical example of Australian accuracy. Perfect shot, Swag. I thought you said the idea was to hit the pineapple. Like that. Let's see if you can shoot off a harpoon like you do with your mouth. You want to put some money where yours is? $10? $5. STEAMER: $4. FRANK: $3? You're, uh, covered for the $10. STEAMER: Okay, Jody, shoot. $20, and he'll do it again. You're covered. I got another $10 that says you'll miss, flash. And the man's bet is heard. Accepted and recorded. You got a lot of money ridin' on this, flash. You tightenin' up? (ALL CHEERING) Now for $60, my partner will shoot the pineapple off the top of my head. No takers? Then, uh, someone point me toward the nearest bank. Hey, I'll take the bet. Look, I was just kidding. No, no, no, not your head, mine. Look, uh, you give me the $60. Hotshot hits the pineapple and you get it back. If he doesn't, it's mine. What are you, crazy? Hey, what are you, a chicken? Come on, you guys, cut it out now. Hey, stay out of this, Russ. Hey, hotshot, it'll give you a chance to feel awful big, as big as me. Okay. Hey, Ess, you want a blindfold? No, no, give it to him. I don't think he can bear to look. Boy, and I thought Australians were crazy. What are you gonna do with the money when you're dead? Well, I'm not going to be dead. Even if he shoots, I don't think he's got the stones to come anywhere near me. (SNICKERING) Hey, Ess, what you got to say now, huh? Well, you're takin' back your own money. So in my book, that's a draw. Right, hotshot? Nice going, buddy. Good shot, Jody. Have you seen Augie? I think it's time we were going. Not since she threw Jody's buddy. You talking about that judo character? Yeah. Anyone who shoots at pineapples on people's heads shouldn't talk about characters. I'll find Ally and see if he knows. You don't have to. I know where she is. She's with my buddy, Chase, at my place. Come on, I'll walk you over. Heads up. Well, come on. Miss Poole, I should like to take this opportunity to inform you that this is the last clean shirt I have. I'm sorry. To make it up to you, what would you like to hear? Uh... * How dry I am No, no, no, no. You still want to go over? Oh, no, she's having too good a time. We can take a walk. Well, I'm fresh out of harpoons. (CHUCKLING) All right. I'm Jody Wallis. And I'm Brie Matthews. (BIRDS CHIRPING) The three of us have been beach buddies since we were kids, and always talked about coming over here. And I guess we figured it would better be now because, well, we won't be getting together so much from here on out. Why not? Well, Chase is probably heading East for school, and Steamer's workin' full time. And you? Me? I'm available full time. What do you mean? Well, I'm what you call a surf bum. You mean you don't work or go to school or anything? Not since last year. Why, does that bend you all out of shape? Oh, why, no. No. It's, uh, it's really none of my business, but isn't there anything you want to do besides surf? Oh, there was once, only I couldn't do it. Why not? Because I got took by a bunch of phonies, that's why. Hey, Brie's kind of a kooky name. Is it short for something? Mmm-hmm. Bringard. Bringard? Yes. Mama's Swedish. She and Dad met when he was overseas. Well, I like Brie better. Brie sounds clean and free. It fits you. You're a funny boy. One minute you're shooting harpoons at someone, and next you're very nice. A mixed up generation, that's me. Say, what are you doing over here, anyway? I'm visiting Augie. She invited me over for Christmas vacation. We go to school together in California. Oh, what are you studying? Well, I'm only in my first year, but I think I'd like to be a teacher. A teacher? Oh, I know. I know it's underpaid and overworked. You're right. Yeah, but just a minute. There are a lot of wonderful and useful things to do in this world. If you turn away from them or pretend they don't exist, then you're the loser. You know something? I like you. You say that as if it were hard for you to like people. Oh, not people like you. Just the phonies who go around trying to put everybody down. You know, Jody, everybody's not a phony. I know you're not. Why'd you do that? Well, I'm not exactly sure, but I... I guess I had a sudden flash of harpoon guns, surfing parties and yippee and all that. All I wanted to do is kiss you. I know. (SIREN BLARING) What's that? The warning siren. What does it mean? The beginning of the big waves. (WAVES CRASHING) Let's go! What do you think? Looks pretty big. Oh, what do you mean "pretty big"? CHARLIE: Hey, look who's here. It's William Tell and his merry band. Well, flash, let's see you take off on one of these and show us what you can do. Are you kidding? Why, they're just out here on a social visit. They couldn't catch a wave with a net. Hey, big set outside! So long, suckers! Are we jerks, man? We should have known that wave wouldn't hold up. Okay, big boy, let's see if you really got it like you said. (HONKING) Hi! Well, do you see them? Yes, yes, there they are. Right out there in the lineup. CHARLIE: Hey, what happened? Did you guys get a little wet? JODY: Look, wise guy, I'll take that board... ESKIMO: Hey, hey, cool it, hotshot. Cool it. That's the oldest gag in the world. If you don't like Charlie's waves, then pick one of your own. RUSS: Big set, big set outside. How about you, ace? Next time. Move over, I'm comin' through. Okay, Charlie, now it's my turn. Hey, Phil, what's going on out there? They're tryin' to put Wallis down, but he's not havin' any. Hey, will you look at that. I knew my instincts were right. (HONKING) Isn't he something? Hmm, yes. What do you mean by yes? Oh, I mean, mmm... (LAUGHING) (WHOOPING) Hallelujah! Hey, get Wallis, he's all alone. Isn't he wonderful? I can almost understand why he doesn't do anything but surf. You know, his style is a lot like yours. Are you kidding? I'll take Ess' any day. (SIGHING) Hello. Hi. Hi. Hello. Oh, who's that? Huh? Oh, that's, uh, Frank Decker. AUGIE: He's good. Yeah, you know it. Nice ride, mate. Thanks. Where's Chase? Gone in to say hello to the girl. They're here? STEAMER: Yeah. Hey, maybe we should give them a little demonstration of the art. Why not? Ha, ha, what do you know, a busted skeg. (CONTINUES LAUGHING) Sorry, Jody, I guess I got carried away. Forget it. See my board? It's right here, flash. Thanks. Don't mention it. If you guys got no more control than that, you shouldn't be out here. Look, you pick your waves and we'll pick ours, okay? Sure, flash, just as long as you pull out every time you see me takin' off on a wave, there'll be no trouble. You can stuff that. The wave belongs to as many guys as can make it. Well, just don't make any with me. Look out, Frank! (COUGHING) Frank, sorry. My skeg must have cracked. I'll get you for this, buddy boy. I'll get you. PHIL: Are you all right, Frank? CHASE: Looks like his nose is broken. I think you're right. Let's get him up on the beach. Hello! Hello! (HORSE NEIGHING) Hey. Well, hello, old fella. Well, at least you came by to say hello, huh? WOMAN: Don't! You'll be missing a couple of fingers if you're not careful, mister. You're not serious, ma'am. Old Brutus there would eat your hand as soon as a carrot. What's your business, son? Well, I, uh... Uh, he's going to try to fix the truck, Mama. Uh, I met him at the gas station, and Mr. Nakagawa said he could come. How much? Let's see if I can fix it first. Well, it's right down there, just where it stalled. There's some tools under the seat. Now if you'll excuse us, we'll take the horses to the barn. Come, Lily. (NEIGHING) (ENGINE STARTING) You mean you really can fix it? Didn't I tell you so back at the gas station? Well, that's wonderful. Not really. It's just the, uh, needle valve was stuck. I thought you might be getting thirsty. Well, you thought right. Thank you. Hmm, would you mind telling me what's going on? Well, I just said the first thing that came into my head. You're a surfer, and I didn't want to get you into trouble with mama. You mean, like the guy who got the load of buckshot? That's right. With mama, surfers are like a red flag to a bull. She thinks every one of them is nothing but a lazy loafer. Why? Well, you see, my father was one of the best on the islands, and she just can't get over his leaving us. Oh. He...he left for Bora Bora three years ago and hasn't come back. Why anyone would want to leave a place like this beats me. Well, mama's from New England and thinks work comes first, always. And papa's from Maui, and he thinks that singing and dancing and surfing are--are just as important as work. (BIRDS CHIRPING) You know, I--I don't even know your name. It's Ralph. Ralph Lane. The guys call me Steamer. Your name is Lily, isn't it? Yes. I'm sorry about all this. Oh, I'm not. Only, uh, I think we ought to tell your mother the truth. I'm not a surf bum. I'm just a guy who came over here on a vacation to ride a few big waves. Oh, no. If you even mention surfing to her, well, I won't be able to see you anymore. That is, if that's what you came here for. You know it is. Well, then you're just going to have to be the boy from Mr. Nakagawa's. MRS. KILUA: Lily, lunch is ready, and bring that young man with you, if you like. Come on. But remember, you're from Mr. Nakagawa's. Nakagawa's. "Mr. Chin has everything." Oh, he's gotta be kidding. Do you want to bet? CHASE: Look out, Augie. (AUGIE SCREAMING) AUGIE: Oh, Mr. Chin! (AUGIE SCREAMING) I'm so sorry. Go off unexpected. Oh, Mr. Chin, you're the Rembrandt of fireworks. That's perfect for New Year's Eve. Would someone mind telling me, what have fireworks to do with New Year's Eve? You never see New Year in Islands? No, I never have. Whole sky light up with rockets. Red, green, silver, gold. American flag, Mickey Mouse. Whole island filled with noise of a thousand thunders. Beautiful to cry. Well, don't you have a lot of fires? Oh, yes, many fires. Much beauty, too. Oh, yes, much beauty, too. Is my order ready? Oh, yes, all ready. Come. Short notice, but ready. I have everything here for you. Four dozen string firecracker, 20 Roman candles, 15 Green Devil, one dozen rockets, all colors, and one Nike Zeus. (AUGIE EXCLAIMING) It's perfect! A Nike Zeus? Yes. Special Miss Augie order. Whole island going to see this one. Oh, it's just what I wanted, Mr. Chin. Uh, there's, uh, nothing missing, is there? Missing? Oh, no, it's not missing. Is under nose cone. Oh! (BOTH ARGUING IN CHINESE) Mr. Chin, what's in that thing, anyway? Enough gun powder for trip to moon. That's what I was afraid of. Who gonna blast her off? AUGIE: I am. Well, you be real careful, Miss Augie. I never make one so big before. You light her, Miss Augie, and you run like hell. Uh, wait just one minute, Mr. Chin. She could be blown up before she even had a chance to move. Oh. Oh, excuse me, I think I get big idea. Wait a minute. (SPEAKING CHINESE) Hey, look, honey, as far as I'm concerned, we could just, you know, wave around a couple of sparklers, huh? (TUTTING) That is the old Chase Colton talking. The new one should be all excited about the message in that nose cone. What message? The one I had Mr. Chin put in especially for you. For me? Uh-huh. Why? Because I see you, that's why. And what I see is nice. Well, I see you, too, Augusta Poole, and I like. CHIN: Hee-hee. You no look like you need Hot Poppa suit. You need cold shower. Oh, here, you take this, Miss Augie, and bring back after New Year's Eve. Oh, thank you very much, Mr. Chin. Uh, uh, w-what about him? Oh, him? You no worry about him. Him only my brother-in-law, and next year I replace him (LAUGHING) With automation. No! No automation! (ARGUING IN CHINESE) Bye. Here we are, Waimea Falls. Oh, it's beautiful. You see that rock up there? You mean, the one with the lei on it? That's the Hawaiian sacrificial diving rock. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Put up there by one of the ancient Hawaiian kings himself. Oh. Oh, you're lying. Yeah, I am. (BRIE LAUGHING) What it is, is a bunch of bull the surfers made up. You see, if the waves at Waimea Bay are slow in comin' up, all the guys have a big bash and everybody gets charged. And sooner or later, one of the guys gets a case of the braves and decides to take the jump. And that brings Waimea up? Sometimes. Most times it brings the ambulance. See, the only place it's deep enough is dead center. And if you Miss or a gust of wind blows you off, you wind up with a pretty permanent headache. Well, then, why do they do it? Surfers are a crazy bunch of guys. (THUNDER CLAPPING) I think in about one minute, we'll be right in the middle of a rain storm. I saw a house near the meadow. Can you run? At a time like this, like a deer. Well, let's go. (PANTING) (GIGGLING) Well, it's closed for the winter. Come on in, they won't mind. Oh, yes, they will. We're leaving puddles. We're not the only ones. (LAUGHING) See what I mean? Yes. Here's another little buddy of ours. Here we are. Compliments of the management. Oh, you can change inside. Yeah, but is...is this all there is to it? Well, yeah, it's a pereau. All the women wear them. Yeah, well, not at Mills College. Well, they should. (LAUGHING) BRIE: Jody? Yeah? Why is it with you that everyone's guilty until proven innocent? What do you mean? Well, I mean, you see phonies everyplace like some people see ghosts. The phonies I know are no ghosts. I come from a match set. Who? My mother and my father. Maybe you remember her. She was Wendy Wallis on T.V., and ran a how-to-keep-your-husband show. Until it leaked out she was married four times. And my dad, well, he built swimming pools. Goes around calling himself "The Swimming Pool King." Pinches waitresses and goes around picking up big tabs in night clubs, even though he's only one step ahead of the sheriff. You know, it's funny. I hear about kids having trouble with their parents all the time, I think there must be something wrong with me. You like yours, huh? Oh, yes, I like them a lot. Girl, you ought to. They sure knew what they were doing. (BRIE LAUGHING) Listen, you want another laugh? I was going to be an oceanographer. You see, I always loved the sea. I just couldn't wait to go to college. Then after about the first week or so, I realized the whole thing was just hopeless. Just couldn't cut it. Why? I didn't know enough. Oh. Well, maybe not enough rooting interest, I guess. You see, my folks just dumped me in school just to get rid of me. They didn't care whether I learned anything or not. So you just packed up and left? Wouldn't you? No. Well, I did. I know. And I shouldn't have, huh? That's right. You know something? What? You're pretty. Oh, Jody, would you do something for me? Sure, what? Go back to school. I just told you I couldn't make it. Well, I'm sorry. I think our clothes are probably dry. What's the difference? You still can't go anywhere. Nevertheless, I still think we should get dressed. I suppose you hated it? I didn't say that. You're darned right you didn't. You liked it just as much as I did. I think we'd better get dressed. Yeah. Jody, I'm sorry. Forget it. Jody, did you really like it? What difference does it make? Well, a lot. I wanted you to kiss me. Swell. You want to go for double or nothing? Oh, boy, I really asked for that, didn't I? What do you think? Well, I think I should mind my own business. Good idea. But I can't, so will you just answer one question for me? All right, one question. If you don't go back to school... There you go again. That's not my question. If you don't go back to school, what are you going to do? Answer: surf. But, Jody, you can't spend your whole life surfing. Well, why not? Maybe I'll wind up the world's greatest surfer. Is that what you want? Well, who cares what I want? I care. Come on. I do. You don't have to be a surf bum. But I am. But you don't have to be. You're smart, Jody. You can be anything you want. You really believe that, don't you? Yes, I do. And you think I quit too soon? Yes. I threw in the towel just a little too fast, huh? Yes. Oh, Jody, why don't you give it another try? Why don't I? Oh, Jody. (GRUNTS) Put it back in the shop. Now, look, Jody, I know you're good, but you've never ridden Waimea. You go out there for that last ride against guys like Eskimo and Russ, you don't know what you're getting into. Look, Phil, all I want to know is does it work the way you said? Can I make some money at it? Sure you can. But if you're going to get big enough to put a board with your name on it and sell it, you're gonna have to go all out from here on. And if I did, can I make enough money to go back to school? You won't get rich on it, but you might make $80 to $100 a week. That's plenty. You really think you can do it, huh, kid? I can try. NARRATOR: And for the next couple of weeks, Jody did just that. He tried. As a matter of fact, they all did. First, here at Sunset Beach, then at Laniakea, the Bonzai Pipeline, and finally Makaha. But it didn't take two weeks for the real competition to set itself up. That happened the very first day. At first sight, the waves at Laniakea didn't look so big, but they were. The Bonzai Pipeline was a perfect name. Just a nice big hollow tube of water. The curl was high and fast. The turn was critical. And if you missed, it swallowed you. Makaha was just plain scary. But to some of the boys, it was suicide. Man, is he getting creamed. He's taking gas. What happened, Jody? Did you get caught under there? Yeah, yeah, I got caught. (PANTING) (FIREWORKS CONTINUE EXPLODING) (CHATTERING) Hey, what did you set them all off for, Ally? It's only 11:50. To clear the decks for this one. Hey, Augie, you kidding with that thing? Nothing to worry about. All you have to do is stand back. Stand back? I'm going to dig myself a slit trench. All right. Hey, wait a minute. What? Nobody's allowed on the firing line without extinguishers. Thank you, Swag. Hey, now, that's good punch. What's in it? What isn't? Maybe even a little punch. Thank you, sir. Mush, Augusta. Here, let me hold your drinks. CHASE: Thank you. Oh, be careful, be careful, careful. Watch it. Gently. Gently. gently. That's it. Oh, good. Are you ready for this? Oh, the Hot Poppa suit. Oh! (MUSIC PLAYING) Hmm, I don't believe it. Neither do I. Thank you very much. Can you do that? Yes. You're kidding. Well, I do it a little different. (ALL CHEERING) Go on, show me. Do you want me to? Sure, why not. All right. Ally, ia Moorea. ALLY: Ia Moorea. (MUSIC PLAYING) (ALL CHEERING) RADIO ANNOUNCER: And now a bulletin has just been handed to us. There's a strong indication that the height of the seas heading for the North Shore are still on the increase. However, it's too early to judge when the giant waves will hit. Will you guys tell me something? How long can Waimea hold out? I have to get back to California. Hey, it's comin', Russ. When a storm lasts this long, something's got to give. Yeah, but when? Oh, I don't know. Ask the boy wonder. Hey, yeah. Jody, what do you think, boy? About what? About what? Don't tell me that wipeout's affected your brain. You shouldn't let a little wave like that bug you, hotshot. Wait till you see Waimea, with guys falling off the waves three stories high. That's when it really counts. Hello, Frank. "Hello, Frank," he says. How do you like the nose? Look, I told you, it was an accident. I'm sorry. Don't be. The doctor says I can surf again. So maybe I can do the same for you some day, buddy boy. Did you hear the weather report? Yeah, I heard it. You know, it's funny. Two weeks ago, if anybody told me about big waves, I probably would have yawned in their face. Look, it's New Year's Eve. Can we lay off surfing for one night? All right, Jody. Hey, everybody, it's two minutes to midnight and it's time for Big Bertha. Augie, are you going to light it or ride it? Both. (AUGIE SQUEALING) What time is it? What time is it? You got about a minute and a half. Good, good, light the torch. Light the torch. There's something I have to tell you. Not now. It's got to go off at 12:00. I have something that I want to explain. My helmet. My helmet... It's right here. Oh, thank you. Augie, will you listen... No, no, no, no, you'd better go. Hurry, hurry, hurry. (WHISTLING) (ALL GROAN) Well, Augie, I guess you really did come up with a bomb. (ALL LAUGHING) (FIREWORKS EXPLODING) ALL: Happy New Year! (ALL CHEERING) ALL: * Should auld acquaintance be forgot Happy New Year, Jody. Want any more punch? No, thank you. * Be forgot * And days of auld lang syne? * I'm sorry it didn't go up, Augie. I guess I took too much powder out. What? Well, I got worried, for you. It just didn't make any sense. You square. You big, miserable square. Do you know what was in that nose cone? A great big heart with our initials on it. Honey, I'm sorry. If I could get the darn thing off the ground, I'd go up with it myself. I wish you could. I wish just once you'd do something, anything that didn't have to make sense. Well, maybe I will. What? I don't know. I'll have to think about it. Well, come on. I'll help you out of that suit. Oh, don't you touch me. Don't be silly. Chase Colton, I'm warning you. I'll break you in two. Well, you really would, wouldn't you? Yes. All right, then, if that's the way you want it. Happy New Year, muscles. Happy New Year. (SOBBING) Happy New Year. Same to you. (GRUNTS) Where are we going? Someplace where we can be alone. Oh, honey, no. I just don't want to make a fool out of myself in public. Well, what do you mean? Sit down. Lily, Lily, I'm an orphan. I've only got a little bit of money. I bang fenders for a living and I hate it. I know all that. Yes, but what you don't know is that I love you. I know that, too. Well, then, just tell me straight out, what you think of it. What do you think I think? No kidding? No kidding. There's--There's, uh, a second part to this. Look, I don't know how to say this without you thinking me some kind of a gigolo. You want to stay on the ranch? Lily, I'd be good on it. You need me, and I just love it. Oh, Steamer, I was hoping you'd say that. Well, what about your mother? I mean, we've been lying to her for a week now. Well, we'll just have to tell her the truth. Everything will be fine now that she knows you. You'll see. You think so? Oh, I'm sure of it. Lily, meet the man who's got everything. Oh, Steamer. (MUSIC PLAYING) CHASE: Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! What are you made up for? You are looking at the ancient Hawaiian High Priest that's going to make Waimea come up. You mean, you're going to take a flip off the falls? That, Charlie boy, is exactly what I mean. You can start waxing up the boards right now. Come on, everybody! We're off to the raging torrents! (ALL CHEERING) Hey, what's cookin'? Ah, he's going off the falls. This should be worth seeing. Not me. I climbed up there three times last year. Every guy chickened out. Come on, have a drink. He's not really going to do it, is he, Augie? Of course not. He's got too much sense. I think. Chase, wait, please. What's the matter, isn't this crazy enough for you? It's too crazy. You can't do it. Oh, yes, I can. You hit the head right on the nail. If I hadn't been so square, maybe I wouldn't have to be running away from school, and maybe there'd be a big heart floating up in that sky right now. MAN 1: Hey, Chase, look where you got to go. MAN 2: Yeah, buddy, way up there. (WHISTLES) Boy, that's, uh, that's sure crazy, all right. Well... Chase, no. Listen, Chase, you got rocks in your head if you try something like that. Now that, my friend, is just what I plan to avoid. How much did he have to drink? Enough to be where he is. Chase! Come on down. Nobody will call you a chicken. Ha! How could they? I'm a bir--bird! (GASPS) Isn't there something we can do? What do you want me to do, go get him? No. Chase, don't be a fool! Never, but never call an old Hawaiian priest a fool! Chase, don't do it, please! I sail! That old rocket didn't go up, so old Chase Colton is coming down! Hey, you guys, can't you hear it? Waimea's up! Come on! What are we waiting for? Let's go. SWAG: Okay. Oh, boy, this I got to see. Chase, did you hear that? Waimea's up! You don't have to jump! Besides, I like you just the way you are! Maybe you do, but I don't! Happy New Year! Oh, you idiot. You mad, crazy idiot. (WAVES CRASHING) A surfer. A beach bum. And all these days you lied to me. Yes, ma'am, and I'm sorry about that. No, Mama. It was my fault. He didn't want to. I made him do it. Then you can make him march right out of this house. No, Mama, listen to me. Steamer is good. He has a job and he works hard. And you saw how he loves the place. And you know how much we need him. I need him, Mama. No, Lily, I'm not going to let you make the same mistake I did. Work your fingers till they bleed while he goes off joyriding on the waves. In the end, he'll leave you and break your heart. You've no call to say that. Oh, don't I, though? No. No, you don't. Look, I've been up here helping out more than I've been surfing. Sure. Getting on the good side of me because of Lily. But you beach people are all alike. All you ever really want are the waves and lolling in the sand and doing nothing. Lolling in the sand? I--I'd like to show you how much lolling I do. Here's my bankbook. $1827.40. And my union card. It says I was 17 when I got it. Only I wasn't. I was lying. I was only 15. And here. Here's a credit card printed in gold. You know what that means? I stuck around straight for five years and paid all my bills in full. And here's a receipt for my car. Stamped right there, "Paid in full." Oh, what's the use. I'm sorry, boy. Maybe you do understand the difference between work and play. You--You mean it's all right? Oh, Mama, I'm so happy. You won't be sorry. I promise you, Mrs. Kilua. I'm--I'm not even going back to the mainland for my things. My uncle can ship them right on over to me. And starting tomorrow, right after Waimea, I'll move in and I'm going to work for you. MRS. KILUA: Right after Waimea? Is that what you said? Yes, ma'am. I heard it on the radio. It's coming in. And you're still planning to surf it? I've been planning to for years. That's why I came over here. Did I say you were different? Did you hear that, Lily? The first day, and he's back on the beach. Oh, Mama, please. Waimea isn't the beach. But those are the biggest waves in the world and they come in maybe, maybe only once a year. And where after that? South America? Australia? Everybody wants to try Waimea. I must have been dumb to think that this could work out. It's not that I can't live without surfing. It's just that I don't think I could live here. Now, Lily, by tomorrow night, it'll probably all be over and I'll be headed home. Now you're old enough to come back with me if you want to. Steamer, I can't. Well, that's plain enough. (DOOR CLOSING) Didn't I tell you? He'd leave you. He didn't leave me, Mama. You drove him away. Just like you did papa. Jody. Jody. Look, will you just get out of here? Jody, I know you've been upset all evening. If you're in trouble, then I'm in trouble. I'm not in trouble. Yes, you are. You're scared. All right, so I'm scared. Know what it can do to your timing when your reflexes have to act like that? I know that was a bad wipeout you took at Makaha but... One little mistake, do you realize what could happen? Isn't this what you want? Look, why don't you face up to it? You're hooked into a born loser. If I were you, I'd make tracks out of here as fast as I can. But, Jody, I'd never do that. Whatever happens, I'm with you. Don't give me that phony loyalty jazz. Phony loyalty? Is that what you think? Look, will you just leave me alone? Get out of here! Do you really mean that? Yeah, I mean it. All right, I will. But let me tell you something first. You're just fine as long as things are easy. But the minute they become difficult or don't work out the way you want them to, you'd rather quit and feel sorry for yourself and call everything phony than try to do something about it. Call everything phony? My life has been lousy with phonies. I think the only real phony in your life is you. MALE ANNOUNCER: Well, it's happened at last. The day everyone's been waiting for, Waimea Bay has finally come in. The World Of Sports is about to bring you one of the most spectacular sights the islands have to offer. Young surfers riding waves 20 to 30 feet high with only the very best of them challenging each other to stick it out for the last ride. It's a beautiful day here at Waimea with spectators waiting to see who's to be number one, the top man in this wild and dangerous sport. Look at them. It's like a ruddy Roman circus, all waiting for us to go head over heels. Nobody's forcing anyone to ride. Just myself, mate. You're looking at the first Australian to win at Waimea. Hey, where's the hotshot? He'll be here. Well, I've a feeling I'd like to bet on that. CHARLIE: Well, you made it, flash. Hey, we should have taken that bet. Yeah. Hi, Jody. Hey, look, pal, if it's money you need or anything... Look, I don't want to talk about it, okay? (GRUNTS) What's the matter with you? Nothing. I guess I cracked a rib last night. Oh, that dive, huh? Yeah. And you're still going out? I don't want to talk about it, okay? Are you ready, hotshot? Yeah, I'm ready. Well, come on, buddy boy, let's go. Well, they're all out there now. I count 16. Only 16 wave riders out of all those who came to Hawaii to ride the big surf are willing to face these giants at Waimea. SWAG: All right, men. I guess the man from down under is going to have to be the guinea pig. Up the rebels! Come on. Whoo! Shall we give it a try? I think I'll sit one more out. Well, not me, dad. Goodbye, cruel world. Good luck. (WHOOPING) Well, it looks like it's about our time, buddy. Look, don't tell me what waves to take, okay? Yeah, okay. Hey, get with it, man. Is this why you came out here for? Yeah, hotshot, you got to take off sometime. Hey, Jody, it's only the greatest. It's like flying. Yeah, but I can't make it. I can't take off. Sure, you can. All you got to do is catch one and you'll be fine. Come on, the three of us will go together. Yeah, buddy, let's go. Your ribs? Yeah, my ribs. I don't get you. What are you, some kind of a hero? If you can't cut it, you shouldn't be out here. You know something, buddy? The same thing goes for you. Looks like we had our first casualty. There's a boy in trouble out there. Come on, boy, let's go. Chase, are you all right? Yes. Yep. But I think it's strap-up time for this old rib cage. Oh, well, at least I got to surf Waimea, huh? You, uh, want to take me to the doc? Augie can do that. I'm too busy. Give them hell, buddy. Well, off to the doc with you. Brie, go get the jeep. Now just hold on a minute. We're staying' right here. You don't really think I'm gonna Miss this, do you? But... Later, Augusta. Later. Well, look who's here? I thought you'd grabbed one and called it a day. Just getting warmed up. Yeah, well, let's see if we can't start cooling you off. Hey, out the back. Big set. There's a good ride, Phil. Yeah, it's early yet. We've had one casualty. Now it just looks like we had another. He doesn't seem hurt, but three or four wipeouts with all those tons of water pounding you to the bottom is about all anyone can stand. Even these superbly conditioned young athletes. There's another casualty, folks. But this time, it's a surfboard and not a surfer. If you want another board, there's one at the house. What did you say? There's another board at the house if you want it. Steamer, everything's going to be all right. Hold on. I don't get it. You two have shown me some terrible things about myself, Steamer. Will you forgive me? You know I will. Well, then, let's go get the board. Now, look, I... I've had enough. Well, there's always next year, Steamer. Sorry about the board, Steamer. Gee, that's too bad. Oh, well, half a board is better than none. Not in those waves. Say, how's the, uh... It hurts. Phil, how long can they keep this up? Worried about Jody? Yes. The waves are really building up now. So it shouldn't be too long before the ranks start thinning out. Do you think Jody can make it? He's as good as any surfer I've seen, and that's for sure. But Eskimo's the man to beat. Whoever does that is gonna need a lot more than just being good. What do you mean? I mean, Eskimo's a bulldog who's gonna be in there until the bitter end. The only thing that's gonna beat him is character, honey. A great big chest full of character. Well, the battle continues with the wildest competition I've ever seen. There are six surfers, just six left. To give us the lowdown on what's going on, I've got Russ Fulton and Ally Maloha with me. What happens next, fellas? That can't last too much longer. See the way the surf's pounding the bottom? It changes the way waves break. Makes it hard to find the pocket. The pocket? That's the place you take out from to catch a hard ride without getting creamed. Okay, I'll say it. I think we're a bunch of suckers out here busting our backs while those squares in on the beach die laughing every time we go on our heads. So far, I haven't seen you go on your head, mate. You don't even take off near the peak. Just the shoulder where the waves are a lot smaller. You're the one to talk. I haven't seen you make a wave yet. Yeah, Charlie, but he takes off on the top. You think I'm poultry? Yeah, I think you're chicken. You'd have to be crazy to go near the peak the way the bottom is now. So be crazy once, or get out of here. I'm not going out there. So what's so big? It's supposed to be a sport, not suicide. Suckers! And the showboat let out a last gasp of steam. Hey, buddy boy, it's about time for you to quit, isn't it? Well, shall we go, mate? Let's go, Ess. They're going back out. Yeah, that's murder. All set? Yeah. Hey, digger, Swag, dig. Dig. So long, yank. Up the rebels! Buddy boy, hands me quite a laugh. You giving lessons at Waimea. You know something, Frank, I think it's about time I gave you one. Oh, very nice ride by Eskimo Dobbs. Don't you think so, Russ Fulton? Yeah, it is, but Frank took a bad wipeout. I think that's it for him. I'm afraid so. Hey, Frank, you'd better call it a day. Are you kidding? Hey, he's right, Frank. You busted up your nose again. You did this. Look, get off my back, will you? Get off it? I'm going to ride right up it. Well, you're seeing it for yourselves. Eskimo Dobbs, Frank Decker, and Jody Wallis fighting it out for the last ride. Remember those names, because before long, one of them is going to be known to every surfer who can stand on a board. If you've got a brain left in that skull of yours, Frank, you'll get out of here. This place is closing down fast. If I don't make it, he doesn't either. What do you think you're gonna do? I'm gonna shoot this board right for the back of your head. Oh, yeah? Well, why don't you try? Frank's nose is bleedin'. Bad? Not good. ESKIMO: Jody, watch it! If Frank ever did that to me, I'd slaughter him. You see how that last wave broke? Yeah, it's falling apart more every minute. Where is he? I'll kill that lousy... Hey, forget it. He's all through. He's going in. Well, it's just you and me now, hotshot. How come you yelled? I'm an Eagle Scout. Here we go. Just Eskimo Dobbs and Jody Wallis are left. It's shifted bad again. Let's try over there. Why are they moving around? They're looking for the right spot to take off from. STEAMER: Here they come. Why don't they quit? Because that's not the name of the game. I don't see how they can keep up much longer. That's too much. I just can't believe it. Getting tired, Ess? Don't you believe it, hotshot. What's the matter? Am I starting to bug you? That'll be the day. Watch this ride, sonny boy. Boy, did he get the ax. Ooh, you can say that again. One more wipe out like that, I'm gonna go there and drag him in. Hey, look, forget it. This place is flat out of control. They're not makeable from anyplace anymore. Now, you got a draw whether you like it or not. Look, you're just gonna keep wiping out till one time you don't come up, and I'll still have a draw. Okay, hotshot, it's your funeral. But don't think you're going to beat me to any place but the morgue. Hey, hotshot. You're okay. Why, I never thought I'd see the day when Ess came in and Jody went out again. He's crazy. Yeah, but if he is, he's my kind of nut. Jody, you can't go out there again. You're gonna get killed. If I can find that take off just once, I know I can make it. But you can't. No one can. They're all saying that. You know, last night you were right. Sooner or later, I've got to do something on my own. Oh, but I never meant this. Come on, kid. Come on, kid. Hey, he did it.
