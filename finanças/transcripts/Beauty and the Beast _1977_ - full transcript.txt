THE SLAVE Here you are at last, my gorgeous queen. Don't call me queen. I'm just one of your slaves. I am your slave. Vladimir the Great. The Greatest of the czars. I'm on my knees begging for your love. I'm a miserable mortal. Ask me whatever you want. I'll make you a rich woman. Rich and powerful. The whole world will kneel at your feet. Your denial is a torture for me. I am just something you paid for to play with. Play, then. I want your warmth. Your love. Your blood. Your life. What do you want? The prisoner has just confessed. He is the leader of a bunch of rebels inciting the populace against us. Their names? There's no way to make him tell. Take him back to prison and let him starve to death. God's already taken his soul. The devil, not God! Don't dirt God's name with that scum! Cut him to pieces and give him to the dogs. Let them feast in the kingdom's honor! Don't disturb me anymore! My queen. Do with me what you please. Why you don't want to share the fire that burns inside of you? How can I convince you? What is your dearest thing? I offer churches and believers to my God. You are above him. I offer myself. Swear. By God. You'll do everything I want, won't you? You only have to ask. I want your dearest thing. The power. I want your power. For one day. My power would be a nuisance for you even for one day. Believe me. I want to be in your place for one day. Why don't you answer me? Is this the love you have for me? You're nothing without power. Do you realize what you're asking me? And you? You see? Fine. My kingdom will be yours for a day. You decide when. Tomorrow. Tomorrow? Fine. You have my word. But please... don't let me wait one more night. Tomorrow you will reign but now I beg you, one more night of waiting would drive me crazy. You know how to get your relief. They're all yours, aren't they? If you want I'll order to throw them to the dogs. You are the one I want. Tomorrow. My sweet queen. I'm still a slave. Now I'm your slave. All of your desires will be fulfilled. Get on your knees. Kiss my foot. Stand up. You scare me. Are you repenting? If I should die... because... because of you, I'd love it. If I should die because of you I'd love it. What is your first wish? I want the Minister of Finance. You want the Minister of Finance... You want the Minister of Finance... Why? You want a gift? If so, ask it to me. I'll give you everything you want. Just ask... - And I'll cover you up with gold. - Shut up! Or you can take back your power. No. Enjoy it. Please. The Minister of Finance. What now? Which is your next wish? I want you to marry me today. You're scared. No. You have the power but you have it only for today, not for the whole life. And you could obtain more being my lover than my wife. Give all the money to the people. But my dear... That would lead to a revolution! Do as I say! Your head is becoming a useless thing. People like submission. They're used to live with nothing. But if you give them a chance to think they can ask for more you won't be able to control them anymore. That would be the end for all of us. Please, desist from your proposal. So there are more important things than your love for me. Don't talk! Each of your words is a lie. You don't know what love is. Bring all your slaves here. My slaves? Here in the throne room? It's a sacrilege! What about me? Am I not a slave? What are you talking about? You're the queen today. I want to test your patience. Your power has no limits. Bring the slaves in! You'll be free at sunset. But I have a present for you now. The prisoners will be released too. You'll enjoy a rich meal all together. Thank your queen. I can do a lot of things before the end of the day. Do everything you want. I only want you. When the day will be over you'll kill me. I'll love you. Get it. Very well. On your knees. Use your mouth. Come closer. Your master wants to watch as we make love. Guards! Cut her to pieces and throw her to the dogs. May they feast in the kingdom's honor. Very good. You're the queen of the Amazons. Quiet Ivanovic. Do I really deserve to be the daughter of Russia's richest man? You're my wife now and I'm proud of you. And of your beauty. Quiet Ivanovic. He's upset. As if he's feeling your femininity. Are you jealous? My dear, jealousy comes from suspiciousness. And it becomes rage when suspicion becomes certainty. Only the weak is jealous. Someone who doesn't trust himself. I'm not suspicious about you. You're the ideal wife. And I'm very pleased. Thank you my love. It's you I have to thank for letting me partake of your beauty. Go now and get ready for dinner. Undress, Barbara! You'll have the company you deserve. Please! I beg you! Let me out! I see to my regret that you enjoy your punishment. You won't get food anymore! You're possessed by the devil! THE WHIPPING Judas' first son Er married Tamar but God found him guilty and made him die. Then Judas said to Onan, his second son, go to your brother's wife go to your brother's wife and give her a progeny but Onan prevented conception... pouring his sperm on the ground. His conduct displeased God... who made him die too. From Onan comes the word onanism, synonym of masturbation. Though Onan practiced coitus interruptus. You! How many books form the New Testament? Were they written before or after Jesus' death? There are twenty seven books in the New Testament and they were written after Jesus' death. I always tell to myself this thing has to end but I can't resist. What did you do to me? Are you sure your husband won't be coming? Yes. Don't worry about him. Why did they send you to bed without dinner? I lied. You lied? I've heard your mother saying she found you rummaging in her room. Good night. Who declared holy the war between Italians and Saracens. Pope John the 8th. It seems as though you will never learn. Bend over! Thomas? Thomas, are you there? Answer, Thomas. Are you trying to scare me? I know you're hiding there. I'm not afraid. What are you doing alone in the dark? Come here. Don't make any noise. What are you doing? Peeping at your mother? She has a lover. Who? My mother! Your mother has a lover?! Don't let her notice we are here. How do you know about that? I saw them. She's beautiful, isn't she? When did you see them? I saw them... doing that thing... Which thing? He kissed her... there. I don't believe you. She was lying on the couch and he was on his knees. Then she kissed his... And then? There he goes! I'm going away. I don't want to stay here. What do you find in this? Pleasure. I don't see how you can find pleasure in peeping at your mother. It's disgusting. Take this. What for? Beat me. Please. You want me to beat you? Are you crazy? Beat me. Beat me on the ass, please! You're crazy. I'm not your teacher. You think you're expiating your sins by being beaten? Beat me! Or I'm going to tell all my friends you were here with me! Did I hurt you? I can't. You're not going to get me! Now I'll tie you to the mainmast. Yes. Tie me. Imprison your slave and torture him to death. How can you like this? I don't know but I like it. Tie me! - May I confess you something? - Sure. I like it too. Tighter! Tighter! Beat me! Beat me! THE PROMISE Hello little one. How are you this morning? Wonderful! You're marvelous, my dear! What's that red on your face? It's my fault. I've been keeping her here for more than an hour. Good. You have to suffer to enjoy pleasure. Wonderful. You don't seem to be enthusiastic... That picture is not so good... you know, black and white... Black and white or color, that's not the problem. Look at his smile... What's wrong with his smile? He's so elegant. And looks so clever. If you think so... Remember, it's the woman that makes the man. The man just needs to be good, polite and rich. And he has all of these qualities. Oh, I forgot! Guess who's just arrived? Your cousin Eric from London! He's so grown up that I almost missed to recognize him. I'm finished. We can take this off. It will be ready for tonight. Please be on time! What a happy wedding it will be! You're a man, now... I'm just two years older than you. I'm 18. I know it. It seems like yesterday... ...we were kids. Tomorrow I'll be married. When are you going to show and teach me all those strange and beautiful things you told me when we used to play doctor? We were kids. You told me that when we would have been older... We are now. I can't just tell you... without showing. Than show me. What are you waiting for? This is a kiss. I know. You always have to start with a kiss. Go on. Touch me. I've remained a virgin for you! As I promised! And you haven't been able to take me! I kept my promise! My husband will take me, then! Wait, Giovanna! I want to talk to you! I didn't mean to scare you. You didn't. What's this? Chamomile-tea for the young mistress. I'll bring it to her. Don't worry, I'll make a good service. - Is everybody else asleep? - Yes, sir. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Really beautiful! That's it. You're wonderful! Let's go, we're late. We don't want to upset our hosts, do we? Hi. You know, I've had a strange dream last night. Maybe I've had the same dream too. Then why don't we meet after the ceremony? We could talk about our dream...
