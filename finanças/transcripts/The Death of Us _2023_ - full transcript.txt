The story of the virus changes by the hour. So how exactly did we get here? People are just tired of the kinds of restrictions, but there are fundamental things that we talk about all the time that I've discussed with you many times. The physical distancing, the Washington. What's up with your boy Trevor? Wearing a mask where. Morgan, they say it's airborne within six feet. We don't have to accept. You need to turn this off, Katie. No, Katie, you stop.

It's getting scary. We'll just have to ride around the neighborhood from now on. As long as we can. It'll blow over. Is that why you're wearing a mask? We begin today with an alarming milestone right here in America. New York state now has more reported cases than any country in the world. Let that sink in for just a second. And new pictures are a disturbing reminder of the human toll of that. This is a mass grave being dug for victims at New York City's Potter's Field where unclaimed bodies are laid to rest. Counting the dead is now part of the daily. Leave your Shoes outside. 9-11 Was supposed to be the darkest day in New York for a generation. We lose 2,753 lives on 9-11. We've lost over seven thousand-. Everything's closed. Were you in contact with anyone? That is so shocking and painful and. No! Like I said, everything's closed. Here. I'm not wearing that. Only when you go out. Breathe. I have one client left, Morgan. I'm down to seven cars. But it'll be okay. How is it gonna be okay? They just dug a mass burial grave in New York City. All because they don't have enough room. Is it still a joke to you? No. No, it's not a joke. I have to deal with the effects of this virus every fucking day. The numbers don't lie. But the news does. As the daily death toll continues to reach new heights. Last one 18 million people are out of work right now. At least we're not alone. I gotta get out here. I'm going for a ride. You wanna go?

You sound like Morgan. . Well, I mean, you know, they've been talking about population control since Plato. So here we are now. Population control. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, four years ago they actually, they did this dummy scenario with Bill Gates, where they could see how effective a virus could be, you know? And now here we are and they're trying to get like a worldwide vaccination. Okay. If they get that going, that's how they're gonna get chips in us. It's, it's, it's not, it's not good . It's not. And don't even get me started on the whole 5G thing that we got going on right now. Um, I'm, yeah, I'm sorry. I, I I can go on all day. Uh, what kind workout do you want to do? Um, let's start on legs. Leg day. Love it. Let's do it. So how long before this breaks? Uh, hard to say really, but pretty much once they hit their quota, I think they'll shut it down. But the second wave is where we're really gonna be in trouble. Second wave. Oh yeah. Hey, uh, excuse me. I'm gonna need you to keep it moving man. I get all that. I was just wondering. Can you tell me at least when the bans gonna be lifted? I'm not a cop. Yeah, but you out here working bro. I appreciate what you doing? What are you doing out here?

The new rules will go into effect Friday. We should go to New York. New York has the highest death toll right now. You think he needs to worry about you too? I just don't know when I'll see Devin again and I don't know what I'll do without him. Look, the best thing for us to do is to ride it out till he gets back. Deal. Hey, where you going? I'm going to start to get some wet wipes. Do you want anything? Can you bring me back some mustard? Anything else? Hey, don't forget your mask. Ha ha. That was fast. Where's the mustard? You want the mustard? Then go to the fucking store yourself. And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that? Uh, by injection in. Hey baby. Finally got a break. Figured I give you a call. Are you smoking? Please? Don't. You better than anyone should know how serious that is.

I've tracked the drone surveillance, the routes and their times. Now they usually come around the house every hour, but since it's raining, they cut it to every three hours. The military still is-. Nothing's changed. They still roll around every other hour. We have two hours. Do you trust me? Katie, we can't stay here. Where are we gonna go? My parents have a cabin in Big Bear. It's solar powered. We have running wells and we got backup generators and enough food to last us a few months. Big Bear's an hour away. Can hike it in four day. You wanna walk? Being on these streets is suicide. We'd have to go through the hills. I've already got it mapped out. If we leave, we die. If we stay here, we die. Don't you understand? Where does it stop? It starts with quarantine. Then, martial law has us all thrown in fucking house arrest. Then they cut off our fucking power? They will not stop. This is our only chance. I trust you.

Huh? I didn't want you to worry until I had everything figured out. We only got six shells. Hopefully we don't ever have to use it. I can't do this. Katie. Katie, look at me. Yes you can. Something doesn't feel right. We've been over this already. This is your plan? You said you had it all figured out, but we almost got caught this morning. I know. And that's my bad. It'll never happen again. Alright? You're talking four days. The wilderness, the military, drones. Look, don't overthink it. How can't I? Because I already have. I don't wanna go to prison for the rest of my life. Neither do I. Morgan. I really think-. Look, I know this sucks, but this is our only option. So we start here heading east through Angeles National Forest, then up to Mount Baldy, cross three highways, then up to Big Bear. Four days. Four days. We leave when it's dark.

Five twenty four eight twenty three. Do you hear that? Katie. Give me the knife. You don't hear that? Katie! I didn't hear anything. You weren't listening for it. Okay. Give me the knife please. It works. They changed the times. Drones, military foot patrols. It's all completely random. Now. What's the point anymore? We're prisoners in our own home. Now they're trying to starve us. I'll figure it out. I will. I got it! I'm giving them what they want. What? And get killed? For what? For them to win? We've already lost. I forgot this thing even worked. Right. It's nice. I haven't seen you in a couple of days. I'm still here. It was sweet of you. What was? The night we met and you guys helped me to the car with my groceries. You know, Devin wasn't gonna even say nothing. Right? I didn't think he even liked me. Ahuh? He stuttered. He broke stuttering in the sixth grade till he met you. His face was so red. He loved you. He loved you too. When's the last time you had a hot meal? You know this isn't going away. No. I thought about what you said the other day and you weren't wrong. Only if you agree. Know, I love you right? . We're gonna get through this.
