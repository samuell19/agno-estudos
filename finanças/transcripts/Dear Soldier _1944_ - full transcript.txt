Produced by the News Bureau of the Joseon Military Dear Soldier The purpose of this film is to introduce the courage and diligence of the soldiers in the military through a portrayal of their strict training and of home-like army life. Even though there are millions of enemy soldiers... Congratulations to Hiramatsu Jenki for being conscripted. Hello! -You're home. -Yes. Is the letter here? -I'll take it. -Thank you. -Sister-in-law, I'm here. -You're home. -Hello. -Welcome. -Mom, I'm home. -Where have you been? -Hello. -Welcome. Good to see you. You have a letter. A letter for me? -From the Governor? -What? About what? As we enter into the third spring of this Pacific War, we are happy to announce that your son has finally been conscripted into the Emperor's army. They must mean my brother. When he joins the army, he will live under strict rules and receive rigorous training. For him to become a great soldier, there is no better present for him than the warm encouragement of his mother and sister. This is so because when faced with a moment of life or death, it will be his mother that he will remember. I'll read it later. I'm so grateful for this letter. He's home. -You're home. -Yes. -Do we have a guest? -Saijun's here. I see. Brother? -Are you busy? -No, come on in. Is everything ready? That's it over there. I mean emotionally. Yes. It won't be easy. Do your best. I'm sure you must know that you've been chosen from the young men of this peninsula. Yes. The honor of our people from this peninsula is on your shoulders Try not to disgrace your father's name. Always remember that. Yes. There are only two stitches left. After this one... -Saijun, you do it. -Me? -Here. -Me, too? Mom, you do the last one. All right. I'm home. -Hello. -Hello. -My son. -Yes, mother. The Governor sent us a letter. -The Governor? -Why don't you read it? I will. I'll give this to my brother. He'll be happy. -Come with me. -It's okay. Then, I'll be right back. Brother, Can I come in? Sure. Brother. It's all done. I made it with Saijun. No wonder it is so well made. What do you mean? You must be happy, right? -About what? -You know. Just look at you on hearing her name. It must be difficult for the Governor to care about us so. Yes, but this is important. There'll be millions of us from the peninsula who will be conscripted. Jenki has a big responsibility. Yes. But so do you, Mother. Mom, Mom! Look at Jenki. What's wrong? Oh, you're here. Thank you for this. -See, he's happy to see her. -Stop it! What's going on? You are at it again. Nobody can stop these two. Mr. Yatsumoto, you have a letter. Thank you. Is it for Eichi? No. Then is it for me? It's for Yatsumoto Huni. Huni? It's for my wife. You'll be surprised when you open it. From the Joseon Government Dear Mrs. Yatsumoto Huni What should I do? -Mr. Postman? -Yes? You'll stop by the township office? Please tell people that there -will be a farewell party for Eichi. -Sure. Should I put a stamp on this message? Should I put it on your head? Eichi? Stop doing the chores. Mom. I should do them when I can. When I use the firewood that you chopped up for me, it brings tears to my eyes. Wife, wife! -I have a letter to surprise you. -Why don't you read it? No, I shouldn't! It's from the Governor! What? From the Governor? Congratulations to Yatsumoto Eichi for being conscripted. Drink up. This is a special night that will never come again. Where did you get all these drinks? Is it real booze? Cut it out. I brought all the drinks that I've stashed away. Did you really! You will have to live without it from tomorrow. From tomorrow, I won't touch it. I have to live a long time to see my son come back after he finishes his service. That's right. You're blessed to have such a wonderful son. Eichi. You are the pride of our town so please go and make yourself distinguished. After being enlisted, you are not sent in to combat right away. You get trained first. It won't be like home but hardship builds character. Yes, I'll do my best. Everybody can do it so I'm sure he'll do well, too. Let's drink up. Why don't you sing a song to celebrate? Why not? Help me with the rhyme. A ferryman of Giso. Mr. Hontake of Giso. It's cold even in summer. A ferryman in lined clothes. Being lined is good. With his socks, too. I must be too drunk to sing. -It was a great song. -Thank you for saying that. Husband, please don't drink too much. What do you mean? Today is special. Mrs. Yatsumoto. So you got a letter from the Governor? -It's too much of an honor for our family. -You must be proud. You know what, though? There was not a word about his father. Mom. Eichi. What are you doing instead of sleeping? How about you, Mom? I'm looking for something. To pack some medication for you. I don't need it. They have doctors and hospitals, too. Still... Eichi. Take care of yourself. Don't get sick. And when you can, please let us -know how you are. -I will. You must wake up early tomorrow. Don't worry about anything. Just get to bed. Yes, Mom. Yoshimura company -Hiramatsu Jenki. -Yes, sir! Yoshimura company -Magota Ryohei -Yes, sir! Yoshimura company -Yatsumoto Eichi. -Yes, sir! 176 centimeters tall. Everything's fine! Next. Pass, next. Next. Inside the Third Barracks Change into your uniforms now. You're not allowed to have any private items from now on. Everything must be military items. Even the underwear? -Underwear is fine. -Oh. This is the military uniform. These are the military trousers. This is the undershirt. These are the long johns. Thank you. Now that you are in uniform, you'll be treated as soldiers. Attention! At ease! Attention! Listen up! I'm Sawara Sergeant. I'm the sergeant for the Third Squad. You are privates. From now on you must follow strict army regulation. Yoshimura company Attention! Eyes... Front! Present... Arms! Order... Arms! Listen up! As your commander, l'd like to welcome you to the company. I'm happy for you and for the country to see all of you in my company at the height of wartime. From this moment on, you are the Emperor's soldiers. Attention! Eyes... Front! Everyone! Present... Arms! Order... Arms! Listen up! As your Captain, I'd like to welcome you to the company. We started the conscript system here in Joseon. The millions of young men who will be conscripted after you will be mostly from the countryside. The army will treat you and the young men from the countryside equally as soldiers of the Emperor, and there will be no discrimination between you. You must abandon any sense of false pride and conceitedness and fight like soldiers. From today you must live according to military regulation and to your superior officers. As your commander, I am convinced that this military is the best place to mold you into true citizens of the Emperor. Stand closer to each other. That's good. OK. I'll take the picture now. Get up! Get up! Prepare for roll-call! Everyone out! Hurry, hurry! Hurry up and get dressed. Attention! Eyes... Right. Straight line. At... Ease! Everyone, Attention! At... Ease! Eyes... Right. At ease! The roll-call for the First Squad. All 33 are accounted for! The roll-call for the Second Squad. All 33 are accounted for! The roll-call for the Third Squad. All 32 are accounted for! Everyone! Attention, Present... Arms! Order... Arms! Recite the army regulations! One, soldiers are loyal. Two, soldiers are well mannered. Three, soldiers are courageous. Four, soldiers are trustworthy. Five, soldiers are thrifty. Extend your arms. Start! Start your count! Stand straight. Straight line. Double Time... March! Company... Halt! Right... Face! Breathe in and out three times. Start! Wipe away your sweat. How was it? Are you tired? You'll get used to it soon. Is you mother alone at home? You must be worried about her. No, I'm not. I'm sure you are. If you have any questions, ask your sergeant. He will discuss it with you. -Thank you, sir. -Dismissed. Private Yaki is dismissed, sir. Private Magota is here, sir. You have a family. -How old are you? -I just turned twenty. -Got any kids? -Yes, sir. A boy or girl? Well... My wife hasn't given birth, yet. I see. I'll name him if you have a boy. I'm honored, sir. To a soldier, his squad is like his home so everyone including privates, lieutenants, and officers is like brothers and we should help each other like a family. Meal time! -Start eating from the end! -Yes, sir! -Start your meal! -Thank you for this meal. How was your food? Didn't it taste pretty good? Yes, sir. Back home, your families can't eat like this so don't leave any leftovers. Yes, sir. You there, take your time. Yes, sir. You have 15 minutes to finish your meal. Afterwards, you get 10 minutes of rest. May I smoke, sir? Go ahead. Bring an ashtray. Yes, sir. Smoke within 1 meter of this ashtray. -Soldiers who wish to smoke may smoke. -Yes, sir. Can I have a light? Thank you. Are they the new privates who came yesterday? Do your best as soldiers. Don't make noise in the bath house. -Keep that in mind. -Yes, sir. I'll be more careful, sir. -Did you write to your family? -Yes, sir. Then get some rest. Thank you, sergeant. We really appreciate everything you did for us. Attention! Face your Captain! Present... Arms! Order... Arms! Listen up! From now on, we'll provide you with a rifle. -Noda ltetaro. -Yes, sir! -Yamamoto Kipei! -Yes, sir! Present... Arms! -Yamada Ryohei. -Yes, sir! There is an imprint of words on the rifle that was issued to everyone. As a sword was the soul of samurai a long time ago, a weapon is still the soul of soldiers. From today, if your rifle is soiled or damaged, it means that your spirit as a soldier is soiled or damaged. Listen. When you are sent in to combat, you will receive everything new, your boots, backpack, and uniform however, you will carry your old rifle. Can I borrow your cigarette for a second? What's wrong, Hiramatsu? Nothing's wrong. Let's go and get our rations. Rations? No need to rush. Aren't these cookies? There's a bean pastry, too. It's good. You have visitors. -Private Hiramatsu. -Yes, sir. -Private Gunimoto. -Yes, sir. What's going on? He's late. He'll be here soon. There he is. -Where? -There. Present arms! Order arms! -Brother. -How are you? How are you? It's been a long time. -Have you been well? -Yes, thank you. I feel the way I look. You look like a soldier now. I still have a long way to go. -Where is Mother? -She couldn't come. She was so excited to see you but she had -to help out with the Mothers for the Army. -I see. Now I can have visitors every Sunday... Let' go over there. Shall we go? Brother, how is it? Is it very difficult? No, it is not difficult at all. Now I have confidence that I'll become a great soldier. He's become more handsome, hasn't he? But I'm sure I am still no match for you. Pick a fight with me, you'll lose. He is my friend, Yatsumoto. Really? Yatsumoto, this is my younger sister. And this is her friend, Aoki Saijun. Hello. -My name is Yatsumoto. -It's nice to meet you. He told me that you've been a great help. No, it's the opposite. You! Your aim is too low. Magota! Raise it higher. Good. Is everyone in the right position? When you are ready, fire. Don't forget even when you drink and eat that we are the Emperor's soldiers. This red bean porridge is delicious. I wish we could eat it together with our comrades on combat duty. Me, too. Daketa liked sweet things, too. I'm sure he misses this training time. ln his last letter, he said things are not better there, and he misses the training time. He wishes her were back, but he wants to do his best or die trying. What a great attitude! Hiramatsu. I think the military is different from what I imagined. I just had the same thought. Listen. When I hear the Army song, I feel like I am listening to my school song. Hey! Where are you taking that bean pastry? -Yes, sir! -Answer me. Take that bean pastry out. -I'm sorry, sir. -Finish it here and go. Light allowed. Stand up! Right. Good. Have a seat. You are working hard, I see. Don't overdo it so that it affects your training. Promotion will be decided by your attitude as soldiers and how you apply yourselves in everyday training. -Magota! -Yes, sir. I received a report from the company storage office. You must finish your meal or snack within the confines. -Do you understand the regulation? -Yes, sir. Why did you carry out a bean pastry? Well... It tasted so good that I didn't want to finish it at one sitting. You have a piggish appetite, don't you? Yes, I do, sir. -Be careful from now on. -I will, sir. Magota. The storage officer used to work in customs. He was a sharpshooter when it came to finding problems. He is just as meticulous in the Army. The Army Anniversary. Thanks. I hope I wasn't rude the last time. -Please drink before it gets cold. -Thank you. -Go ahead. -All right. Brother, should I play the recorder? How about it? Play something light, would you? We are happy to have you but can't offer you a lot to eat. Why don't you try this at least? -Thank you. -Mother, it's okay. We get all the cookies we want in the Army. Sweet jelly beans and cookies. I can't remember the last time I had sweet jelly beans. Rice cakes and bean pastry are this big. -I envy you. -I'm not finished with my story. They gave us this much bean porridge... Would you stop? You're making me hungry. Shall we go now? When is your curfew? It's before dinner time so it's 1 7:30. When is the next time you can come and visit? We take turns for our leave-time on Sundays and holidays. Next time let's get Saijun and go somewhere. All right. Mother, take care of yourself. Come and see us often. And take care of yourself. He really seems like a solider now. I'll come back as a brave hero of war. This was a promise I made as I left my home. Without being distinguished as a soldier, I won't be able to die. Every time I hear the bugle sound for attack, I see before me... Magota and Yasumaoto, go in. -You got letters. -What? Letters? "I received your letter." "I am well. How are you?" Magota, read it out loud. I will. Listen. -"I am well." -"I received your letter." ''How are you?'' "I wanted to write to you but things kept me too busy." "I want to know when you'll be home." What I wanted to tell you is that on the 6th at 3 o'clock in the morning, "I delivered a baby girl." "I delivered a baby girl." "I delivered a baby girl." "I am fine and so is the baby." "So you can be rest assured..." -Hey, you must be ecstatic. -Don't make a fuss. -Let's go and do our laundry. -All right. Let's go. -Hey, what's wrong? -Nothing's wrong. -Why don't you go and see your family? -What, sir? Your father is not well, I heard. Yes, sir, but my mother told me not to be concerned. Still, you should go and repay all the love he gave you. Thank you, sir, but my father told my mother not to tell me -so I will not go, sir. -You won't? lf you apply, I'll grant you a two-day leave. Then I would like to go, sir. Good. I'll give you the paper that you have to fill out. Thank you, sir! How are you? Thank you for coming to see me. Here. -Here. -Thank you. Thank you for visiting us. Don't mention it. Thank you for helping us out with the farm work, too. I'm sorry we caused you so much trouble. I'm so sorry. Don't mention it. It is our job to help you in every way that we can. Eichi! Husband, it's our Eichi... Father, I'm home. Eichi. How come you are here? I was given a leave to see you. Really? Father. -Why are you here? -How's your health? I told you not to tell him. I just mentioned it at the end of the letter. You shouldn't have. I am not feeling well because I stopped drinking. Eichi. Just turn around and go back to the Army now. Why don't you at least take a look at your son? He's become a handsome soldier. His uniform really suits him. Here are the cookies that our sergeant gave me to give to you. Listen, my son. I'm happy that you came to see your old father but if the village people find out, I'll be too ashamed. -Our neighbors... -I don't think so. You shouldn't say that... Father. I am not here to see you. What? I'm glad you're here. Mr. Gisaki, I'm sorry to trouble you but today before the conscript physical exam, can you get all the men and their families together? Today I wanted to meet you and have time for an honest talk with you all. I wasn't given permission to talk at a place like this. So, please think of what I have to say as a friendly chat to share my Army experiences with my friends and their families. When I first entered the Army, our sergeant and commander told me that an Army squad is like a home to its soldiers. According my experience, it is. The commander is my father, major my mother, lieutenant my brother, our sergeant my sister. I even learned how to wipe myself in the toilet from my sergeant. I'm not joking. I had to learn how to protect myself from getting a contagious disease. lf you follow the orders of your superior officers and do your best at the tasks given to you, military life is neither strict nor difficult. Before entering the Army, people do not know about this. So don't worry, and go get yourself examined. Be proud to enlist. And parents, you can rest assured and send your precious sons to the Army. The enemy bullets are whizzing by you. Lower your position and move forward. Magota! Your position is too high. Who told you to hesitate? That's right, Hiramatsu. You should look like a cat ready to pounce on a mouse. -Ando Dakeo. -Yes, sir! -Ganamura Shoji. -Yes, sir! -Ganeta Herei. -Yes, sir! -Ginakawa Hideo. -Yes, sir! -Nishimura lsamu. -Yes, sir! -lnoue Goi. -Yes, sir! Private Hiramatsu Jenki. These 1 1 privates will be promoted to privates first class. Congratulations, everyone! You did great. Thank you, sir. Sergeant! I really didn't know that I would be promoted. -You really didn't? -No, sir. This is all because of you. No, it isn't. Your grades were not high but your everyday performance was given a high grade. Now that you've become a first class private, you should do better. I'll do my best, sir. Go and tell this good news to your families. Yes, sir! I've been down this path before. Ah, that's right. Acacia trees are in full bloom. Sergeant Sawara, you have visitors. Look at those cherry blossoms. -Aren't they great? -They are. I didn't know they would be this pretty. But... Where is Eichi? No. lf we meet his superior, it will be as good as seeing our son. I'm Sawara. Are you my son's sergeant? It is a good thing that we came. Blue roof, golden roof When the crescent moon is hung on the dream castle, a red cradle is being rocked. The sleepy flower reminds me of my love. A young mother swings A blue lantern. A child must be happy to listen to the flower song about an old city. -Private Yatsumoto! -Yes, sir! Your parents are here to see you. Yes? Go and see your parents. I've informed the lieutenant already. Go and spend the whole day with your parents. Yes, sir. I feel bad about being allowed to have this special privilege. They came to see me. Why don't you give your parents a tour of our company? Yes, sir. Thank you, sergeant. I am more grateful to your parents for being so concerned. -Please give them my regards. -Yes, sir. Why don't you sit? I am just grateful for everything. lf you don't do your best here, you will put me to shame. I'll do my best. Father. Please watch over us for a long time. Don't worry about me. Yes When I go back to our village, I'll tell the young men. -Yes. -You will, too, won't you? Yes. Yes, I will, too. Dear Mother, it's already summer. I am doing well serving the country. Please rest assured Training in summer is difficult but in the afternoon, we have nap time so don't worry about me. ln the evening, we drink sodas at the shop. I'm sure you will not understand how delicious it is after a hard day of training Mother, I'm sorry I couldn't write to you since the last time I saw you. I hope you are well. Under a special order, we have been promoted to privates first class. Please be happy for us. Field training will start soon, and we have been looking forward to it. Take care. Your son, Eichi. When the order is issued for the field training, you must follow and execute it immediately. There is no difference between training and real combat. So, during the training, you must protect the harvest and farm animals of the people. You mustn't cause any damage to the farmers. You mustn't act alone. Keep them in mind. As the Captain said, you all did a good job. How was it? Was the training difficult? No, it was easy. No need to lie. You all look dead tired. It's not because it was difficult. We are just hungry. You've all become great soldiers. -Hiramatsu. -Yes, sir. When you first came here, I worried whether you would be able to make it. But now you've become a solider. -Sergeant, I'm sorry. -No, don't say that. Now I won't worry about you even in combat. Let's eat. Thank you for this meal. When I do laundry, it reminds me of my wife. Do you miss your wife? You don't know because you are not married. This is not fun, it's not fun at all. I don't know. Everyone is feeling great. We are all full of confidence. I'm glad we finished it and did great. Isn't the weather just great! Calling everyone from the Third Squad! Calling everyone from the Third Squad! Face... Right! At... Ease! Present... Arms! We are all here, sir. -Gishi Shunpei. -Yes, sir! -Hiramatsu Jenki. -Yes, sir! -Magata Ryohei -Yes, sir! -Aski Shinjo -Yes, sir! -Saito Ai -Yes, sir! -lchiyama Jo -Yes, sir! Those of you whose names have been called, come forward, get your supplies, put on your combat uniforms, and come back out, understood? Yes, sir! Sergeant, please put in a word for me to the Captain so I can go, too. Yatsumoto. There is always next time. I don't think it is fair that I won't be able to go this time. What's the reason? Yatsumoto, don't be stupid. This is an order. There are only orders in the military. -Let's get going. -That's right. Let's do this. Yatsumoto! Yatsumoto! -Where is Yatsumoto? -I don't know. Yatsumoto! I'm sorry you cannot go with us this time. But what you do here is also important. Hiramatsu, don't try to make me feel better. Can't you understand? Soon, you will have new privates. You have to take care of them and train them. Don't you see? You have to do this important job. I'll follow you soon to combat. Mother. Please congratulate me. Congratulations, my son. You, too, Deiki. Brother, congratulations. Congratulations. I'll do my best, and I'll be home soon. Of course, you will. Mom, why don't we have a farewell party tonight? Prepare something delicious for us. There is no need. There isn't much to cook with these days. It's okay. I'll prepare something nice with what we have. Good. Army food is better than yours. Don't say that. I'll call Saijun today and ask her to help me out. -It's OK, isn't it? -Yes. Deiki. I can do it alone so don't make it into a big deal. Jenki. You can be a true soldier only after you've had combat fighting. Yes. Don't worry about home. Don't worry and just do your best. I was never able to repay you for all that you and mother did for me. What do you mean? I am grateful to you. What you've done is the best thing any son can do for his mother. This is too much food. Mother, aren't you tired from cooking? Saijun did most of it. Thank you. Now, this is to the health and good fortune of our Private First Class Hiramatsu. I won't see you for a long time. I'm afraid it will be difficult for you. Please take care of yourself. Thank you, and you, too. Mother. Did you see Saijun off? Isn't she a wonderful girl? What's wrong? The Captain said he will take full responsibility for our well-being and told me to tell you that. You know what? I read the letter that the Governor sent us again and again. It takes hundreds of years for us to have this special opportunity. Mother. It makes me feel so much better to hear you say that. It would have been great if your father had been alive to see you. I did nothing but make him worried. Mother, why don't we go to his grave tomorrow? Yes, he would be so happy. Magota. -Did you have a good talk with your wife? -I did. I bragged about how important the mission is. -Do your best. -Present... Arms! From now on we will have an inspection. Soldiers who will be dispatched put on your combat uniform and get back here. Understood? -Yes, sir! -Present... Arms! Attention! Eyes... Front! At... Ease! 150 Privates are ready for dispatch. Eyes... Front! Present... Arms! Order... Arms! Bugles in the front! Present... Arms! Order... Arms! End
