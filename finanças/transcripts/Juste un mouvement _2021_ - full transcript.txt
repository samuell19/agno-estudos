Cinema can serve to explore the creation of forms, their embryology. Embryology is extremely mysterious. How, once a form has been chosen, it can change, and we can call that a revolution. An about-turn, or as Mao Tse-Tung put it, it spirals... and that's how things change. In that case, the first image... Since those days, cinema has always been made using two reels. One that gets full, and one that empties. As if by coincidence, in video, the left reel is called the slave and the right one, the master. Since real cinema was the one that cannot be seen. Indeed, this film is a real documentary. They never accepted it as such. A documentary is both a little touching and ridiculous. I was trying to present in a plausible way a girl who locks herself inside her parent's big apartment and for two months plays at being a Marxist-Leninist, like others have done, in the street, or elsewhere. There was both real and not real in it... There are central tasks in a cultural revolution, much to solve... The problem is that the visual medium is so scrambled because over 2000 years of civilisation its ideology hasn't changed, so the visual is important, but it's an ideology. So, let's stop. Hi Khouma, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. I'm in town, it's a little noisy. How are you? I'm fine, I'm on a shoot. A series called "Black & White" that tells the story of a girl during colonisation. So, things are a bit hectic. What did you think of the exhibition in Nanterre? Did you see the Godard footage in black & white? The exhibition in Nanterre... It always moves me when I see cinema doing something different. And here it was even more remarkable. But Godard is an actor too! An actor? You're saying Godard is an actor? Yes, when you listen to his interviews, sometimes he's a real actor. Tell me... The making-of you filmed during the shoot with your super-8 camera? Do you think we could look at the footage, and maybe use some of it in the film? To use it in dialogue with my parent's super-8 archives from Dakar? Yes, yes... Have you developed it yet? No, it's impossible to develop here in Dakar. There's never been a lab here. - Where will you develop it? I'll send it to you, you can get it developed in Brussels. Ready? Just a Movement Omar is a figure in whom any African, any young African, especially educated, but not necessarily, can recognise themselves. Not only because of the tragic path destiny took, but also in his desire to reject the established order. He never had any particular destiny in mind for himself. Except to always fight, and also to protect his family, his brothers. He felt responsible for us. He never had anything against Senghor in particular. He saw him as being a victim of himself. He said, "He's a jerk! "When you've been at the prestigious Normale Sup, "you don't behave that way, you do something with it. "He's a loser ! "He's not even a good imperialist intermediary. "Senghor is a has-been." But he did believe that intellectuals have a role to play in society. But when you're a rebel, you don't fight for yourself, you fight for a cause. What matters is that the cause prevails, that it triumphs, and not that you're there to witness victory because the brightest stars are too often mowed down long before the end of the struggle. Omar Blondin Diop : suicide or assassination? He just died like that... The truth never came out. To find out what really happened, they should declassify documents concerning Gor√©e Prison and the Ministry of the Interior at the time of Jean Collin. We just don't know. Re-open the case Palace of Justice Omar's disappearance, his assassination, is one of the turning points in Senghorian politics. I believe that's why it is important to know what happened, because beyond this Omar there were practices, there was an ideology and a system behind it, that we have to be able to read and decipher to understand what remains and what changes or fractures have taken place since then. We weren't really raised as practising Muslims. My mother was very pious but my father wasn't religious. We weren't very practising, though the country is. I know that at times we transgressed religious codes. Especially Omar. At times, people were shocked by that. My mother used to tell him. "When you go to people's homes and it's prayer time, you pray!" But he would just leave. He said, you're praying, you're false devotees. Supposedly for fun, but they were still pretty strong code violations. When you understand this society, it's not easy to say that kind of thing. It was interesting. His father was a doctor, with the limitations imposed on African doctors at the time, that's to say, only giving them lower-level roles. His father had worked all over Africa. His father was very politically conscious. He was someone who... Omar's father's imprint on the family was very strong. This is not a fiction film. If we were in a fiction, we'd give directions. For example, to the main actor... "Walk over there, run to the side!" No, in our film everyone plays themselves. I'm a director, so we see me filming. Malal is the master of ceremonies for the demonstrations going on now. He will be the master of ceremony later, for the screening of the film. Malal is a rapper, he raps in the film. Omar's brothers bear witness... His friends, like Paloma, bear witness... Madiaw is an actor in life, and he's the only actor in the film. The shaolin master also plays his own role. We're just filming people's lives... The documentary is wide-ranging... This is Madiaw. He plays his own role in the film. He's a performer and in the film, he plays an actor. He performed at Thiaroye. We're showing the film, but first, you'll hear Madiaw talk about theatre. Not theatre, that could take a long time, but about how to play your own role. - Yes, acting. Where do ideas that are true come from? So, where do ideas that are true come from? So? They fall from the sky? No. They come from social practice. Journal of the Proletarian Left For Resistance The Senegalese student A well know expression: An arrow needs a target. Just as the arrow must aim at its target, the Marxist-Leninist must aim at revolution. Omar... An older brother is always a bit of an idol. Omar didn't live with us during the school year. We only saw him during the holidays. And every year, we looked forward to his return. Every year, Omar brought us Gallimard publications... So, we shared these books amongst ourselves. We discussed revolutionary theories, debated about what path would allow us to put an end to this domination, about how to end inequalities, how to free the genius in everyone, the potential of every individual, etc..., So, we had friends from all walks of life... The working classes... We facilitated and nurtured these discussions. All we talked about was revolution. Do not sell the future of Africans The Marx-Engels duet concerto or the 5th symphony of Marxism. Karl Marx and Engels played a concert on place de la Concorde. Armed with percussions and acoustic guitars, they were able to bring the crowd to a trance-like state. They had decided to keep their words light, at the level of their audience's understanding. Between two concerts, their manager told them that money was now the world's beating heart and that it was time to stop dreaming and accept the sad reality of modern times. Those wily old capitalists had handed out contraceptive pills and so the revolution will no longer be able to get pregnant and bring into the world a beautiful, strong, muscular child. Everything good? - All good How are you? - I'm good. I need a bag. -Yes... Not a bag, a suitcase. How is Amina doing? - She's good. Where is she? - Amina is in China. She's working over there? Is Amina going to marry a Senegalese and stay here? A husband in China. A Chinese husband? -Yes. No, a Senegalese husband. This is good, strong? - It's good quality! Fifi! Are you at home? - How are you? I'm fine. Did a friend of mine come by to see me? What friend? Nobody came by to see you. I'm not comfortable with you phoning while driving. And you, how are you doing? - We're healthy. Pull over so we can chat. It's dangerous to drive while you're on the phone. I'm going to get out of the car. - You're moving too much. Let's start the scene over. Are you following the script? Do you have a connection? Amina, it's not complicated. Look, it's as if I'm walking, just like this. Yes, I'll walk when you say " Action! " Yeah, like that, that's good. I was saying I'd like to return to Dakar. Why do you want to come back? - Yes, why? Definitely don't come back. You're old enough to get married, find yourself a boyfriend over there. You don't want me to come back? Find a boyfriend in China and stay over there. There is Yin energy and Yang energy. They're in movement. They circulate. Yin and Yang must circulate. Circulation. Yin can be transformed into Yang just as Yang can be transformed into Yin. This is called mutation. If I had to define Omar I'd say he was a mutant. A new kind of man who wanted to change the times. Many comrades still have a very poor work ethos, diametrically opposed to the spirit of Marxism-Leninism. They're like the man who tries to catch a sparrow, blindfolded. Why are you looking at me? I'm not a strange animal. I'm a human being. And your gaze is the same as that of whites on black people in America, Arabs on Jews, or the contrary, in the Middle East. And in the communist world, Russians on the Chinese. The Chinese people strongly support the just struggle of the African peoples Omar wasn't very comfortable with Maoism because I think he still respected intellectual constructs. Maoism was just an alphabet to him. He said: "It's the revolutionaries' abc, like Bible study. "That will get us nowhere." He liked elaborations. Guys like Foucault, he liked that, he liked... Althusser. When guys develop things and then the militants use it to shape political thinking towards creating a popular movement and advance the revolutionary cause. Like Castro, Omar saw him as a fighter, not a thinker. He liked that with the situationists. A constructed thinking, that moves forward, opening up new pathways for thought, promoting a revolutionary ideology. He liked that in the situationists, without being sure it could work. He always believed it could be useful in a Western context. He made a distinction between that and a third world context. Liberalism deprives the ranks of the revolution of effective organisation and rigorous discipline. We must confront vague ideas with clear images. Let's go. One. Two. Come in. Three. Excuse me, I'm sorry - Ah, come in. It's you. You're a little late. Yes, I apologise. That's OK. Come on, let's start again. Salutations. One. The leg first, we move the leg. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Very good. From the start again. Don't forget, when you execute a just movement it must not deviate from its axis. Make sure you stay on one axis. Watch. Your eyes always follow the movement. OK? But it must be the right movement. What is that? He attacks, I block. Go! One... he attacks. The Chinese Girl I first became interested in him because of a film he had a small part in. "The Chinese girl", if memory serves me right. "Chinese girl" or "Chinese boy", I'm not sure of the title because it was a long time ago. When I arrived in Paris, I was a Maoist. I became Maoist through my personal development, by observing what was going on in the world. So, as a Senegalese with similar convictions he peaked my interest. La Chinoise - 115 / take 2. It was Godard's wife, who was called... Mauriac's granddaughter, you know, the writer... Anne Wiazemsky, that's it... She lived with Godard and they got married pretty soon after. Godard wanted to make a film about the passage towards a new generation of French youth with '68 ... Even before '68, the film was in '67. He was trying to understand what the left-wing movements in universities were up to. She told him: "We have guys in Paris, in Nanterre. Stuff is happening, come and see!" He came to Nanterre. He visited the campus and saw posters for the March 22nd movement. He didn't know what it was... He asked questions, he attended a meeting, a General Assembly I think, in an amphitheatre... Afterwards he said, "Look, I'm interested in filming this." But when he asked them, they refused. These guys refused to let him film them. And his wife Anne knew Omar because as Mauriac's granddaughter, she was friends with Antoine Gallimard. So, she asked Antoine, "Do you know anyone who could...?" He replied, "My friend Omar is one of the movement's leaders." He introduced Omar to Anne, Anne introduced him to Godard, and Godard said 'Bingo!' There's one real character in the role of the black guy. He was called Omar Diop. I knew him through Anne Wiazemsky. He studied with her at the university of Nanterre. I had asked him to play his own role in the film. I wanted it to be him who gave a lesson to the others. Precisely, as a black man. Omar Diop died in Senghor's prisons in Senegal. Revolutionary students gradually join the workers' and peasants' movement This is Radio Peking. Comrades and friends, you have just heard the newscast. The prospects of the European Left This is Omar. - Louder! This is Omar, a comrade from the Nanterre philosophy circle. Enough! Comrades and friends, Those who consider Stalin... - Shh... responsible, over and above his crimes and mistakes, for all our disappointments, mistakes and despair, in whatever field, may find themselves very unsettled when they realise that the end of intellectual totalitarianism... Is that dogmatism? - Yes, if you like. When the end of intellectual dogmatism has not given us back Marxist philosophy in full. After all, we can only free, even from dogmatism, only those who exist. I said to him: "Look Omar, frankly, "what you're doing is great but, whatever you do, you'll never be French, even if you were to acquire the nationality." We have a saying that goes, a tree trunk may spend a lot of time in the water, it will never be a caiman. "You'll always be Senegalese and Negro, "so we have to look at doing things in Senegal "because that' s where we can have a real impact." What Stalin's death gave us is the right to draw up an accurate inventory of what we possess, to call by their names our riches and our deprivations, to think and raise the problem out loud, and to engage in rigorous and genuine research. He spent time with the Senegalese Student Association in France, and with FEANF, Students from Black Africa in France as well as the different factions of the French intellectual Left, with a marked preference for the Marxist-Leninist movement, with a Maoist tendency. But, for example, when his friends from the Proletarian Left asked him, "What are you doing with those Trotskyists?!", from the Communist Revolutionary League, he answered, "I'm interested in Trotsky's transition period." That lasted three months, then he moved on to something else. That's how he discovered the Black Panther Party, how he discovered Castroism, how he discovered Cheikh Anta Diop in revolutionary African philosophy. He could see the African situation was irreducable to any of the conceptual schemes available on the "thought market". So, he was looking for a different course of action, an innovative approach. What introduced me to Marxism-Leninism? At first, I found Nanterre boring, a faculty amidst the slums, but I figured a working-class suburb was the right place for philosophy. I saw him empty an auditorium mid-lecture, to trigger a strike. He would enter the auditorium. Two of his friends had gone in before him to cheer and clap when Omar asked people to leave. He would come in, push the teacher away, take the mic and tell the students: "What are you learning? Nonsense. It won't help you in life. "Take control of your existence. "Let go of the education you get from your parents. "Seize control of your lives." Speeches that fired people up. Some were reluctant, others played along. His friends cried: "You're right! Let's go! Let's leave this bourgeois university!" And the auditorium emptied. Nearly every time. These happenings were a way of acting without warning. It was often too slow to get a strike order. Revolution is an uprising, an act of violence, by which one class overthrows another. I'm in philosophy class. Left-wing groups are operating in all spheres. They are particularly active at the University of Nanterre, for example, we have: the Maoists, the Revolutionary Communist Youths, including some of the Trotskyists, the Revolutionary Student Liaison Committee, the anarchists and other colourful splinter groups. Despite their contradictions, these few hundred students, have united in what they call the March 22nd Nanterre Movement, led by the German and Jewish anarchist! Who takes himself for Karl Marx! The aptly named, Cohn-Bendit. This is the first time we've ever seen this. That is to say, we are, de facto, now occupying the Sorbonne. People can go home, but evidently we no longer have the right to be here. The administration has decided to outlaw those inside the Sorbonne, so, they are occupying the Sorbonne. Our task today is simply to highlight and confront these problems, if we want to give a little existence and theoretical consistency to Marxist philosophy. Action! This is Awa, my friend from the Confucius Institute. Hello. Today we are going to talk about cinema. The Red of La Chinoise: Godard‚Äôs politics But this time in Mandarin. On the film‚Äôs release, Godard was, at first, accused of presenting a caricature rather than a serious representation of real Maoist militants. However, thereafter, the film came to be praised for being firstly, a brilliant anticipation of the events of May 68, and also, a lucid appraisal of the fleeting infatuation of bourgeois youth with Maoism, and its return to order or the choice of terrorism. He was in a constant state of inner turmoil. He wanted to make things happen and break down barriers. He was willing to go against the flow and be different. On the ground, we erected barricades together and threw cobblestones like everyone else. In Senegal, we call it barkelo. When you participate in a movement every individual has to make their own small contribution. I remember in May'68, during the demonstrations in the streets, Omar told me: "You see, there are no dead people here. "They've burnt hundreds of cars, they've broken everything "and look, there are no dead people. "You realise, if it was back home, you touch a guy's car, he kills you." He told me: "We need to understand the different worlds we live in." Sorry to interrupt, in my headphones I hear movement back there. Was someone moving? - I heard a few rustlings... No one should be moving. A FILM A FILM BEING A FILM BEING MADE "A film being made", he tells us This is to be understood in several ways. La Chinoise invites us onto the set. It makes us feel like we‚Äôre watching a film being shot. But the film also makes us feel like we‚Äôre watching Marxism, or at least a certain form of Marxism, telling its own story, play-acting. With La Chinoise, Godard shows us what ‚Äúmise-en-sc√®ne‚Äù means in cinema. It is this interweaving that we must look at more closely. The ‚Äúobject lesson‚Äù method perfectly aligns itself with the specific Marxism that, here, serves as a principle of representation, namely, Althusserian Marxism which in 1967, was essentially a doctrine that held that Marxism, for the most part still had to be invented, and that inventing it was like relearning the meaning of the most elementary actions. Godard is likely to have read this sentence in the preface of Louis Althusser's "Reading Capital" which could well sum up his whole method as a filmmaker: ‚ÄúI venture to suggest that our age threatens, one day, "to appear, in the history of human culture, "as marked by the most dramatic and difficult trial of all; "the discovery and learning "of the meaning of the ‚Äòsimplest‚Äô human actions: "seeing, listening, speaking, reading..." Seeing, listening, speaking, reading. Seeing, listening, speaking, reading. "These actions which put man in relation with his works, ‚Äúworks it is often hard to digest and inherit from, ‚Äútherefore making a reinvention of the past necessary.‚Äù So, Omar was part of the March 22nd movement. That got him expelled, just like Daniel Cohn-Bendit. And he ended up back in Senegal. 15 million Senegalese drowned in oil. I simply demand transparency. He says, "If contracts are transparent, then publish them." Publish the contracts. Let us read them! Let those who can read, read for those who cannot. That way things will become transparent. For those who can't read French, let's translate it into Arabic, or write it in Wolof or Serer, write in the languages of the country. It is time to inform the masses. This is very important! These demonstrations are very important. This is not a matter for experts. If, ultimately, oil is to belong to the people then we must give the people back their voice. That's why we chose this format. Every Senegalese, wherever they are, can ask their question. So, guys, if you have questions: come up and ask them! Questions are very important, they clarify things. You should know that they are continuing to block people. Because this is the first time they have surrounded Medina, surrounded Centenary, surrounded RTS and Colobane. So, people are struggling to get here. I simply demand transparency Preserve Our Common Assets! Preserve Our Common Assets! Our licenses are in the hands of drug dealers This corrupt prosecutor summons everyone except the biggest thief Mineral resources belong to the people After being expelled in 1969, Omar enrolled as a research assistant, here at IFAN, the Fundamental Institute of Black Africa. So, he had a small office where he did his research and he really didn't intend to go back to France. He spent time at the university and he spoke at public conferences. And his interventions were very noteworthy because he raised issues that stirred up and excited the crowd. He wasn't like most of us, who came from more traditional Senegalese families where there was a sense of hierarchy and discipline. That was the main feature, he had to be constantly controlled. I think people forget that the problem with Omar was that you had to control him all the time, or he'd go off the rails. Don't forget that Omar's emergence was under single party rule. Even if the Senghor era was portrayed as the fulfilment of black power, it was, nonetheless, a dictatorship, a single party. And that's when Omar appears and heralds democracy, a new culture, the empowerment of women... He heralds all that. That's when Omar started to get noticed in Senegal. A minority with the right revolutionary line is no longer a minority And the tea? - It's ready. Salamalekum. - How are you? Good and you? Thanks. Ah! I get it, yes, I see. There you go. Come on, let's go! Look at your watch, please. Look at your watch. Five, four, three, two, one... You're on air. Like very good politicians, they were able to, through their election campaign, promise the earth... but now we' re dealing with a situation. What is that situation? After all, who will it be hard for? Us! Tomorrow the baker will use diesel fuel, the price of water will rise... In the end, the people can't take it anymore. It creates situations of tension. While at the same time, we hear about billions here, billions there. How much was spent on the election campaign? How much have those in power stolen from the country? From the taxpayers? To govern is to anticipate. And the State hasn't taken the necessary measures. In the end, it is the people who end up paying the price. So, I think we need to stop telling the Senegalese people lies. Some things are harmful for a country's people. This Situation Must Change Y'en a marre (We're Fed up) are not just rappers. They are rappers, composers, but, also, they're fighting against Franco-Africanism, fighting for the emancipation of youth, the emancipation of women. And all this, I connect it, I think everyone would, anyone who knew our fight from forty years ago, would make the connection, the link. One, two, three, four... We have land We have water We can get through this No one's going to give us food Return to the fields, Create prosperity We have young people, And the sun God brings the rain Let's prepare Abundant agriculture Plentiful livestock Prosperity Hunger won't kill us Our leaders piss lying down The watered waterer At work, let's be serious Entrust the country to a good leader Sorry, Diggy, I bungled a few lines there. But, but... we're nearly there! It's, it's ...I like it. Let the country prosper Men and women together Will fight poverty Gruel, millet and milk The State cheats and deceives us all Must we say it everywhere? He tricked me, he tricked you The power of fish is water Think of the kick. - Yes, the kick. Work the fields for the country The power of fish is water Equip yourselves With knowledge and hope Young man drinking tea On the street corner What do you want? You are our hope Joe is dead When I returned to Senegal, we saw each other at the university. Omar was with someone. He said to me: "Bouba, I'm going to introduce you to a free man." I answered: "That's quite a challenging thing to define. "I might be disappointed." He said: "You'll see, he's a real character". Then, Issa, better known as Joe Ouakam, came over. He was someone who always evolved in a fantasy world. Issa was a real surrealist. He really was. It always surprised me. Omar and Issa. How come they got on so well? You had Issa, who was very excitable, very lively, and then you had Omar, who was very cool. Maybe he was learning. He listened a lot. For Issa... The way Issa looked upon Omar was more than just fraternal. Dear brother, Issa and Omar were in a kind fo symbiosis and Omar shared so much knowledge with him, about literary revolt and how literature was evolving, and the understanding that society has to change because the old word is coming to get us... That's what we said in May '68: "Run, the old world is right behind you!" For a society to evolve, the world has to constantly change, because man changes. In 1970, when he returned to Paris, Omar showed a keen interest in the artistic and cultural world because he hoped that was where you could find innovation, where a new discourse was being forged, that maybe a new way of appraising society was emerging there. He didn't really associate with political activists in the conventional sense, but he read a lot. He read Sollers, he paid attention to Derrida, he was interested in what was being initiated by the La Borde clinic, with Deleuze and Guattari, the anti-psychiatry movement. He was interested in these different lines of thought, but not in the old Maoist currents. He still read the situationists. He'd kept issue 12 of the Situationist International. There is a photo that characterises Omar, in which he is sitting reading the Situationist International. The situationists were our guiding thinkers because they were liberators. They let no barriers limit them. Godard: the biggest of pro-Chinese jerks! Truth is the internal link of those things and phenomena, that is, the laws that govern them. To search is to study. We must start from the real situation inside and outside the country, the province, the district, the borough, to identify, to guide our action, the laws that are specific to the situation, and not those triggered by our own imagination. Before playing in a neighbourhood, you have to know its inhabitants. Theatre, Year Zero An actor? That's hard to say. Yes, yes, I am an actor. Chinese students had demonstrated at Stalin's tomb in Moscow and the Russian police had gone in hard with their truncheons. The next day, in protest, the Chinese students gathered at the Chinese embassy and summoned the Western press corps. People like Life, or France Soir and so on. One young Chinese man arrived with his face completely covered in bandages. He screamed. "Look at me! Look what they did to me, those revisionist bastards!" So, all the Western press flies surrounded him and started snapping away while he removed his bandages. They expected to see his face covered in cuts, bruises, all bloody... He removed his bandages like this, very slowly while they took pictures of him. When the bandages were off they all realised his face had nothing. So, the journalists shouted angrily. They hadn't understood that it was theatre. Real theatre. A reflection on reality. I mean something like Brecht or Shakespeare. Urban Theatre Project Principle Our country is made up of two types of men: those who live within the orbit of Western culture, or who are heading there, and those situated outside it. The latter represent the vast majority of our people. They are the ones who have something to say and the others can be seen as mere parrots. Re-establishing contact with the people on the basis of their daily experiences, their history and their language. Our theatre will be the theatre of life. It will be street theatre. It will convey the concerns and interests of the people. I saw the different sides of Omar. On the one hand, a man who was very focused on communicating, who was drawn to those history has done a disservice to, who are weak, and he was able to listen to groups no one pays attention to, but during this period, I also discovered a man of action. The first completely hijacked film in the history of cinema. Can dialectics break bricks? Let's be clear, all films can be hijacked. All the duds, the Vardas, Pasolinis, Godards, Bergmans, also, the great spaghetti westerns, and all adverts. Inviting. Caring for. The relationship between Yin and Yang: harmony. One, two, three, four... Man learns martial arts, martial arts shape man. Working on art is working on your body. Regular exercise leads to good health. Good power, leads to an alert mind. One, two, three, four... One, two, three, four... Go! Revolution is a cake sold at a bakery kiosk on every street corner in the world. The Enraged, the Arsonists are anaesthetised by efficient apps, and their muscles and livers are cut into pieces by phlegmatic modern surgeons in white blouses. The classless society, the dictatorship of the proletariat, are succulent cakes, delicious apple flap-jacks. The revolutionary is compromised. He takes off his shoes, sunbathes on the beach, breathes in the cool, invigorating worldly sea air. He no longer wants to sacrifice himself for a world caught up in the trap of its own lethargy. I heard a revolutionary, in his delirious yet lucid ravings, say: "I will no longer be a martyr." Francis, isn't what's happening now in China important? Yes, of course it's important. What about the young Russian nihilists? Yes, so? They threw bombs, they carried out attacks. So, what happened next? There was the October 17 Revolution. Can we really compare tsarist Russia to the situation in France today? France, get out! At the time when Pompidou's visit was being prepared, all left-wing circles, including the Marxist circles I frequented, agreed it was necessary to express strong protest against France's over-riding control over our country. From January '71 onwards, the Arsonists group created here, to some extent with Omar as their inspiration, took action by setting fire to the French Cultural Centre and the Ministry of Public Works. It was a very heterogeneous group. There were educated and non-educated people, politically aware people and others who weren't, but they all decided to act together, and that triggered the French Cultural Centre operation. We refused bureaucratic structuring. We rejected the democratic centralism so cherished by Bolshevism. And above all, we were in favour of action, and preferably direct action with everyone equally involved. I was the only woman in the group. In the end, I left the group together with Issa because when we understood the orientation was towards violence and more and more violent acts, I was no longer interested and I stopped going to the meetings. And without having discussed it, Issa felt the same way about the direction the group was taking. For a whole year, Dakar had been in turmoil because of the French President's upcoming visit. Palisades were erected so that, while crossing the city, the French President wouldn't see the state the city was really in. People lived in slums, in huts built with recycled wooden pallets used for transporting goods around the port. That's how the shacks were made. They set to repainting all public buildings, and placed French flags all over the city. All for a visit that would last 24 hours. The Africans prepared for a whole year to host a white king who would be in the city for only half a day. The rest of the time he'd be in the palace, in receptions and giving speeches. Mr. President, the Senegalese people feel particularly honoured to receive the President of the French Republic and Mrs Georges Pompidou, for Franco-Senegalese friendship goes back more than three centuries. Anyone volunteering? OK. Me. I believe in terror. For me, all revolution is composed of terror. At first, the idea was to create situations to disrupt the visit. They said: "The international press will be there. "Reports will go around the world. "Everyone will know that in Senegal people refuse French imperialism." In the city, on the route followed by the official motorcade, the police arrested an individual armed with a Molotov cocktail. One, lost amongst the enthusiastic multitudes... Actually, it was an insane idea because the presidential security would have opened fire and it would have been a bloodbath. Luckily, we failed. As a result, Senghor and the rest of the political class, considered this was a new level of tension. This wasn't just pamphlets! There were Molotov cocktails, so violence was involved. At no time was Omar involved... If he'd been there, he'd have stopped us launching the attack by convincing us how badly thought through it was. My brother Dialo, aka Pape Diop, and all his friends, once in prison, decided not to let the system crush them, so they continued to rebel in prison. Omar was in Paris when our parents learnt that Pape Diop got a life sentence for attempting to escape. So, again, Omar abandoned his philosophy teaching qualification and headed back to see what he could do to get the arsonists, but also all political prisoners, released. Within this circle, don't forget, history is repeating itself but as they say in Mandarin: One position, a thousand repetitions. Learning a Tao requires the same patience. Always maintain a circle. Do you know what Tao is? Do you know? A pathway - The pathway. But which path? It is a path leading somewhere. Very well, so... Mr President... Senegal, in its diversity, intends to welcome the black world. This museum was gifted to Senegal by the People's Republic of China. It was designed by the Architectural Institute of Beijing. They visited us to find out what we desired. We were looking for something with an African inspiration, so it's influenced by the architecture of the Grand Zimbabwe and by the Casa Impluvium of Casamance. Fire hydrant Is it wood? - Yes, all wood covering. There is no echo here, it's an amazingly well-designed space without any echo. Throughout the building, there is no echo. So, we have several exhibition spaces. There is this space. None of these public spaces need any artificial lighting. Welcome to the Vice-president of the People's Republic of China In oral traditions, you must be able to speak with your audience. ...Or exhibit other things. An adaptable space. Adaptable? Where? How? Over there. - But where exactly? There, in front of the wall. The real issue is the total area available for exhibiting. In my opinion, there is a problem with the construction design. The outdoor areas are difficult to exploit for exhibitions. Inside, there are too many doors, for example, in the round room. All these spotlights on the walls, it's a waste of space. Yes. You see those spotlights. Actually, downstairs there is... The circular room at the entrance isn't adapted. That's used as the lobby. - Where? The circular room in the middle. Here, in front of you, the third gallery. Echoes are perfectly controlled. I wasn't given enough time. But it was a good presentation, that's what matters. Thank you... Your Excellency, Thank you, thank you very much. I think Omar's violence was mostly verbal. But he was frankly shocked and outraged by the severity of our convictions, so much so that when it became clear we had received life sentences and that his younger brother, Mohamed, at 16, had been given five years, he dropped his PhD and the Paris intelligentsia and, with a few friends, including Alymana Bathily and Alioune Paloma Sall... they decided to go to Palestine for military training. The first thing that was needed to obtain their release was to equip ourselves with the means to move from the weapon of protest to an armed protest, to use a famous catchphrase from that time. His plan was to kidnap the French ambassador in exchange for the release of the political prisoners. And the exchange was to take place in Algeria, under the aegis of the Black Panther Party who were in exile and had access to the Algerian government. They crossed Europe, via Turkey, and ended up in Damascus. And they were admitted to a Fedayeen camp where they underwent basic military training. The plan he outlined in his letter was to move closer to Senegal and kidnap the French ambassador in Bamako. I'm the one who explained to him that it didn't make sense. It was unnecessarily risky because we'd been transferred to a prison for young adults called Fort B, a sort of sinister cellar. But it was also like a sieve. So, I told him: "We have an escape plan. "Send us some money and we'll be in Gambia "before they realise we're no longer in their dungeon. "So, you go to Conakry and once we get to Banjul, "we'll take a plane and meet you there." Unluckily, during a search, in Omar's pocket, the police found my letter describing our escape plan and why I thought the French ambassador shouldn't be kidnapped. That's why Omar got a three-year sentence. For having had the intention to infringe the security of the State without ever having actually carried out any illegal act. It was Friday, May 11th. That day, Omar had come to the end of one-month in solitary confinement, with no visits. You're on just bread and water, no meals, nothing. You're in a tiny little cell you never leave. When we arrived at the jetty, there was a squadron of G.M.I.s, the police mobile armed task force, who were also taking the ferry. We didn't suspect a thing. It wasn't until the arrival of the ferry that the pilot came down from his cockpit, took me aside and explained that Omar was dead, he'd been killed the previous night and that they were planning to bury him, but that the island authorities had refused. So, my brother Auguste and I decided, since our other brother, Mohamed, was there too and that we had no idea if he knew yet... We decided, at the entrance of the circular prison, to each run down one side and shout to let him know. "Omar's dead! They've killed Omar!" What hurt most when he died, was having to collect his stuff from the prison. I was summoned to the Ministry of the Interior by the director of... by the number two cop... who said, "I've got to give you this, it's state procedure." So, he reads me a list and I sign a release. Then he handed me a cardboard box with the newspapers Omar was reading, Le Monde... his razor, his toothpaste, I think there were pyjamas, and his famous Ovaltine that he loved so much... "Wait, that's it, that's really it, it's over?" When I left with this, and drove to my mum's, I swear, it just wasn't possible. It was impossible. I'm sorry. It was impossible. It was impossible. Unbearable. Unbearable. Unbearable. They just hand over these official documents but it's a man's life. That's the way it is. But we knew from the start that it couldn't have been a suicide. Then I got the information from my younger brother, Mohamed, who had witnessed the violence inflicted by special G.M.I task force agents sent from Thi√®s to deal with the arsonists and their accomplices in Gor√©e. Those G.M.I's are not prison officers but they had been sent to break us. After their arrival, we became victims of physical violence... Repeatedly. The State doesn't care, it is violent by rights. It does what it wants. That's what's terrible. I learned that C√©saire had broken off ties with Senghor after Omar's death, saying: "In your country too, as with Mobutu, intellectuals die in seedy pits? " I was crushed. And then the police invaded my home because the walls of the house had been tagged: "Blondin will live, united we will overcome." They had demanded that we paint over it. I'd refused, I'd told my sister we wouldn't do it. So, the police invaded our home and wanted to take everything. I went into the kitchen and tried to... I tried to... cut my wrists. I said, "They want a suicide, they can have a suicide". When the news arrived that they had buried him, that was the trigger that made things explode. Then people started to express their rage very vigorously. It was crazy. When Omar died, when his death was announced, it was like the intifada, like a world war. It was the students, of all ages, everyone. All high schools and colleges went on strike. From 1973 until his recent passing, Issa always had a friendly obsession with Omar. A real one. Omar led him to create theatrical pieces that were a manifestation of his friendship for Omar and also a condemnation of those who had caused Omar's death. Letter to an insular Being The sculpture of sculptures was created In your courtyard The one of the traveller's tomb Initiation to death links us for eternity to generosity, to selflessness, and to the love of the other The other self. On several occasions, we have written and after our third correspondence we received no answer. We write to the minister. - We can only write to the minister. Now... you can decide... Or you can try to directly reach the head of State, the supreme authority, for him to give the instruction. But I'm not convinced that the path of collusion would be more profitable than the path of rupture. But we can try. Now I'm here permanently, we could relaunch the process. Maybe that will work better because it's my, so-called, radical opposition that's an obstacle. Cheikh, what do you think? I agree, if the political will existed, we would have got to the bottom of the story a long time ago. But... No matter how long the night, the sun will always rise and if it isn't us, it will be our children or our grandchildren. Sooner or later, light will be cast on what really happened, with or without the involvement of the State authorities. I think he was an incredibly complex character, remarkable, and I've read and heard a lot of things about Omar, but I believe we've only scratched the surface. I'm not sure we've highlighted what's most important. I was struck by the way Omar wrote. He wrote by hand and I had noticed he always returned to certain words. He went back over them, making them bolder. As if to underline their importance. One of the signs he would give weight to was the question mark. It was as if, for him, the question mark was not just a punctuation sign, and even less so a typographic artifice, but more like some kind of logical connector. Omar was someone who constantly questioned himself. In his eyes, you could never take anything for granted so he was ready to put everything into question, himself and his way of seeing things included. The way he saw the world. Of course, when you make a martyr of him, somehow you fix him, somehow you categorise him. Personally, that is something I am very reticent to accept. I prefer, when I talk about him, to recognise the parts of him that were unexpected and unknown, that part of incompleteness, and I think I am loyal to him in that respect, because he believed that loyalty to oneself comes in movement. It comes in movement. Important societal changes often occur at levels that aren't talked about much. Journalists are interested in subversive, violent movements. But do they go deep enough? If you campaign in Casamance, for education or health, to increase political awareness, it won't get noticed... Not sensational. - ...it won't be sensational. It won't interest the press. But, fundamentally, change occurs at that level and movement, wide-ranging change, needs other types of action, not only acts of dissent. Even if dissent is useful, I'm not disqualifying it. The Preserve Our Common Assets movement is very important. People out in the streets, making a statement. "It belongs to all of us. it is ours!" But we need to get people to understand what's at stake. What's at stake... And make things more transparent for people. "This is what happened, this is what's going on now. "This pertains to us, it is ours by rights. "We are stakeholders. "The way things are managed is wrong." We need to stand up, clarify things with in-depth work. We need to share and mobilise. The two things go hand in hand. Let's stop separating action and thought. They're not in conflict. They're interdependent, complimentary. - Yes! If we look at the continent's social upheavals, for example, the Arab spring revolutions, or take Filimbi, take Y'en a Marre, take Le Balai Citoyen,... Blaise Compaor√© leaves, in Tunisia, Rached Ghannouchi leaves, the movement is one that brings people into the streets to fight against a political power. But who seizes power? Organised political movements. - Yes, indeed. So, you've had a revolution that gets confiscated because you've planned the protest but not how to deal with the aftermath and what kind of society to defend. And so long as we can't imagine what future we want in the aftermath of protest movements... But if I take the example of Y'en a Marre, just after the election of Macky Sall, he received the movement, the founding members, and said to us: "Listen, it's thanks to you I got elected, "because it was so hard to fight against ex-president Wade. "Now, don't be scared to exercise power. "Be brave. You need houses etc... "What degrees do you have so I can give you government roles. "Someone at that embassy, someone at the ministry for youth..." We told the president: "All we want, is to be able to monitor you "for the programme that got you elected." He asks: "How do we do that?" "Mr President, we want to meet you every month, every three months "to take stock of things, "to discuss social issues, "what are the priorities, and so on..." As far as I'm concerned, the president just laughed that away. It hurts me... It really hurts me when I pass by... When I pass by the Grand Th√©√¢tre, when I see the Museum of Civilisations, when I hear the French talk about restitution... I read somewhere that you're involved in this project of restitution. What exactly is the significance of this museum today? Do the young have any use for it? The museum as a building isn't that important. What's important is the questions restitution raises. It makes us ask questions about our history. A significant part of our material production that bears witness to our African history, our creativity, our ingenuity and spirituality, was plundered and taken to museums in the West. The fact that they were there for a century has hindered the building of our identity. A people can't construct itself without an understanding of its cultural heritage. So, it evolves with frailties, with psychological imbalances, with a diminished self-image and a eroded sense of its contribution to human civilisation. At the same time, being told: "You're under-developed and poor, "you've contributed nothing of importance to civilisation." That's false. That's vital for re-appropriating our own history and reinventing ourselves. But... But, actually... Aren't we just making the same mistakes again because the museum is built by the Chinese, designed and built by the Chinese. The museum's built by the Chinese, it's a gift from the Republic of China and probably... - But a gift is also a form of alienation. No... I'm no fool. China isn't there just to be charitable. It's on the continent for the ressources, the raw materials. It's in Congo, Senegal, it's in the mines. In return, China supplies infrastructures, in the form of museums, stadiums, bridges, roads and it does so without causing civilisational problems. China offers the museum, offers equipments. It's what they call 'Soft Power'. China needs economic contracts and needs to be present culturally. Without a cultural presence it's hard to get those contracts. China sets up the Confucius Institute in Dakar. It teaches Mandarin and martial arts. It promotes Chinese culture. It tries to create the desire in young Senegalese to go to China, to study there, by offering grants. Later, these Senegalese will forge relationships with the Chinese which will facilitate the economic relationship. That's the deal. When France... - They create the desire. They create the desire, the relations and the networks. When France makes it harder to go there and increases inscription fees, young Senegalese go to the U.S, Canada and China. That's what's at play. How can we progressively redress imbalances? We must invest in education and health but we also need to invest in building a new African identity. For that we need the means. So, yes, I accept... - Building... A new identity... - Or a rehabilitation. Or a re-invention. - I prefer rehabilitation. But in rehabilitation there's the idea of something that's static. Something was there, it was problematic, you restore it. It's like a resumption. - Exactly. But in re-invention you have a dynamic dimension. In part we restore, but we also re-create. The novelty aspect, something being added. The idea of movement.. - Movement! The idea that identity is not fixed. We are constantly re-inventing what we have been, by taking what was rich and fruitful in our past but adding other elements to it. You and I, we are not our ancestors. We can choose from our ancestors what we value but we still need to reinvent ourselves. And our children will be different to us.
