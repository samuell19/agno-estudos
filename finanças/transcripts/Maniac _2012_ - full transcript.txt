We got a limo, we got weed, champagne. Just come hang with us. Leave her alone. Why are you in a such a bad mood? Can I have a cigarette at least? Or something, a smile? Fuck off.

You better hurry, we're gonna be late. Please don't scream. You're so beautiful. MANIAC. Hello, Redlucie86. Truly timid? It's my first time on a dating site. There's a reason I'm called timid man. Picture... That sounds lovely. Why didn't you agree? Of course I have. - Lucie? - Frank. - Hi. - Hi. It's very nice to meet you. No charm, I'm sure. - You are totally not what I imagined. - Really? What did you imagine? Umm, like fat, with long black hair and just greasy skin full of acne. Huh, you should've seen the other photo I was going to send you. I mean people always post the best pictures of themselves and then that's what something is like when you meet them. I ordered some wine. I hope you don't mind. No, I like a man who takes control. Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. So, how long have you been using the website? Uhh, like six months, maybe? But this is my first dinner date, usually it's just for drinks. Although I can already tell that you are a breath of fresh air for the jugheads I deal with at the bar every night, ugh. See, it's really easy to get over with the testosterone at work, you know? Yeah. So, why don't you have a girlfriend? - I... - Are you okay? I just... Frank, are you okay? You look pale. Is everything okay? Well, excuse me, I- I need to find the restroom. Did that waiter even look Indian to you? I think he looked more Mexican. He was such a tool. You know, it was really sweet of you to drive me home. I'm happy to do it. I had a very lovely evening. Did you wanna come up for a drink? Are you sure? Uh, like I said - begging really isn't my thing, so... Right. Okay then. Sounds nice. So what's all that stuff back there? I thought you were a journalist or something. It's for a fashion shoot. I'm just doing a favor for a friend. So where do you live, Frank? Probably in some trendy loft or something. I mean my place isn't much but it's all mine, so... I'm done with roommates. No, thank you. I still have to drive home. Yeah, but not now, right? You should take off your coat and stay for a little while. Want me to put on some music? I love this song. Dance with me. I think you're cute. I'm gonna be right back. You don't go anywhere. You take a lot of pictures of yourself. Hi... I wanted to slip into something a little more comfortable. So how about that coat? Now it's your turn to do me. Why... Why are you hiding? I don't know. They're little. What do you think? You wanna touch them? You shouldn't be so scared, timid man. Your hands feel warm. Squeeze them. You can do it harder. You wanna get rough playing? Is that what you're into? Are you gonna fuck me? I can't. I can't. Don't be a pussy. You like it? I like to keep the lights on too. Don't be so horrified. You just relax. Why can't you leave them alone? Why can't you leave any of them alone? Can I have just one without you getting in the way? Now look... Look what you made me do. Look what you made me do! I hate you. I hate you. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. I'll make it better. I'll make it all better now. Sorry I missed you today. I have a surprise for you. Are you asleep already? I'm sorry but I just can't wait. Alright. Take a look. I saved the best for last. Here we go. Oh, that's nice. Perfect fit, right? Okay now, this might sting a little. Okay, good. Good. Just one more... Perfect. Perfect. Meet Redlucie86. Redlucie 86, this is my girlfriend. I know the two of you will get along just fine. Don't worry. It's fine, it's fine. What? She's beautiful. Why are you ignoring me, huh? No, wait... This is impossible. No! Why are you doing this to me? What? You too? Why? You're just like her! You two are the same thing as her! Why are you doing this? Why? Hey. I'm sorry to disturb you, uhm... I was just taking pictures of your mannequins in the window. I hope that's okay? - It's fine, I guess. - Yeah? Do you mind if I take pictures of them with the gate open? Okay, sure. Yeah? Cool, thank you. - What's this for? - Oh, it's just fine art, I guess. Here, take a look. - Is that French? Your accent? - Oui. You have a good ear. - What do you do exactly? - I take pictures of mannequins. I try to bring them to life with light. Okay, cool. Thank you. Sorry to have disturbed you. I'm not usually opened on weekends. Well, thank you for opening up for me. Bye. Would you like to see my work? What do you do? Are you an artist? I don't know about all that. Come in, maybe you can tell me. It's amazing. They're from all styles and eras. I've restored most of them myself. She's beautiful. I love her. - What year is this from? - Thirties. She's in great condition. You know what... I'm having a show for my photos in a gallery downtown. Maybe I could use some of your mannequins for my photoshoot. That would be incredible, I mean... They're so much more unique than the ones I've been shooting with. - Is this your place? - Yes. - You bought it? - It was my family's. Been restoring them for three generations now. Who's Angela? The name on the sign. It was my mother. She's gone. I'm sorry. - Do you live here? - Thank you for coming. Sorry, I'm a little nosy. I mean this place is so special. So what do you think if I rent them? Uh, I'm not sure... I usually try to find permanent homes for them. You're funny. Well, I can adopt them. What about that? I'll give you my number. So if you change your mind, I promise to have them home before midnight. I can be a good mother. - My name's Anna. - Thank you. Call me, please. Oh and by the way... You have lipstick on your face. Have a great day. Oh no. No, no, no. No. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Go. Go. That's disgusting. - Move it! - I'm just waiting for my wife. You have ten seconds before I give you a sanitation. Let's go. Come on, let's go! - You ready? - Yeah, let's go. I got my stuff. Ugh, can you turn this on? - I'm sorry! - Shit, you scared me! I forgot my tights. - Hey, do you mind waiting for me, please? - Sure, yeah. Thanks. I can't believe you shoved me in my locker. Don't be tight. - It was just a joke. - Come on... I could've broke my ankle. - It still hurts. - You're such a prick. - But seriously. - Tough it up. - Come on girl, just come out with us. - One drink. - No. - Come on, hun. - Why don't you wanna come out? - I'm going home. - You never come out with us. - What's up with that? - The car's right up there. - No way. - You guys, I think I really hurt my leg bad today. - Really? - How? - I went so fast with that twitch at. I really don't think those tights are any better. - Good night, girls. - Good night. - Get home safe. - Bye. Text me, let me know. Good night. Oh, fuck. - You're so beautiful. - Shit. Oh, shit. What the fuck?! Leave me the fuck alone! Get away from me. Somebody! Help me! What the fuck? Where is everyone? Please, help me! Please! Help me. Help me! Somebody! Open it! Please! Hey! Please. Open the gate, come on! Oh fuck. No, no. Shit. Oh, shit. Fuck! Oh, fuck. No! No! Please! No! Please. No! No! Stop looking at me, focus on your work. - Anna, can you give me a hand? - Yeah, sure. What do you need? A hand, behind you. - Which one? - Second row. - This one? - The one on the right. Oh, sorry. Doctor Frankenstein, I presume. - Are you a fan of those old films? - For sure. Okay, so what do you think about my idea of putting the mannequins among the guests at the show? You could see them mingling, like they're real people. Sometimes I think they have more personality than most people. I think we may have some of the same friends. - So, what do you think? - I think you're incredibly talented. - Well, that makes two of us then. - Not really. - I'm just a restorer. - That one's my favorite. Okay, now you show me. It's amazing. - It's gonna be perfect, Frank. - I'm glad you like them. - I love them. - Why did you want them to be faceless? Oh, I have a little idea for the show. You'll see. Okay, I'm starving. Are you hungry? You wanna grab some lunch with me? It's my third exhibition since I've graduated from art center. But it's my first with this gallery. If it's successful they'll give me a show in their other galleries in New York. If something was missing... Something tangible relating to the concept- The installation of your mannequins with create the ambiance I was looking for. You know, when you came into my shop you looked at them like no one else ever did. You seem captivated. - You must have thought I was crazy. - No. You were so soulful with them. So present. When my mother died last summer, I wasn't so sure what to do with our shop. Most stores couldn't care less about restoring antiques. It's cheaper to buy them new. And if I closed the shop I would've had to abandon them. It's like me and my old negatives. I have boxes full of them but I could never see myself getting rid of them. Sometimes it's hard to move on. So what does your girlfriend think of your work? - I don't have a girlfriend. - Really? Okay... I thought you lived with someone. Frank? - Are you okay? - It's nothing. - It's just a migraine. It'll pass. - Should I call a doctor? - No, no, no-I'll be fine. I just need my meds. I'm used to it. - I'm sorry, I have to go. - Are you sure you don't need help here? No, thanks. I just need to be alone. Watch it, fuck face. Are you suffering from a migraine? This will have a similar effect but you won't need a prescription for it. - And it comes in a nasal spray, so it'll work faster. - Thank you. We have found links connecting the two victims in mid-town. But as our investigation is still developing. I can not give you any more details. All I can say is that all of these women were Caucasian, between the ages of 20-30. They can talk all they want. But they will never understand. As long as you keep a secret. But if you can't, it'll find you... and you'll be alone. You hear that?! The lot of you. Alone. - Now promise me you won't tell. - Franky?! Hey, it's mommy. Franky, honey, where are you? Franky! Come here. Shh, momma loves you. Hey. The necklace is beautiful, Frank. Thank you so much. - Did you make it? - I did. That's original. Where did you get the stone? It's something I found in a thrift store. Is that real hair? What is it? - I believe it's horse hair. - That's interesting. And what about you? Are you feeling better? Oh, sure. I've had migraines since I was a kid. I forgot to take my medicine, so... It's really nothing. Sorry if I've frightened you. - It's okay. - I just finished on- Um, you know-Sometimes I feel like you come from another era. I love it. It makes you very different. One second, Frank. I'm sorry. Thank you so much. - I'll see you. - Yeah. Sorry Frank, a friend of mine was helping me and I had to say goodbye. I sometimes feel like a slave-driver, you know? - I hate it. - I can't say I know what you mean. I've always worked alone. - You never feel lonely? - Yeah. That's why I was calling. I thought if you weren't doing anything... I would love to. But I have so much to do tonight. But what about tomorrow? We could do something. Okay, yeah. Tomorrow night works. - What time? - Nine? - Is that okay? - Nine is perfect. - I'll pick you up at the gallery? - Yeah, super. Cool. Good night, Frank. Good night, Anna. Stop staring. You're missing a movie. Franky? Hey, it's mommy. Franky? Franky, honey, where are you? Franky? Are you alright? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. So what'd you think? You know, Caligari is - to be the first horror movie. I really thought she was gonna get killed at the end. I'm glad that she didn't. Yeah, but they all end up living in a mental hospital. I know but at least it was a happy ending. I may have just found the last romantic. Sorry. Hello? Yeah. Where are you? Yeah, okay. Cool. Yeah, I would love to. Okay, I'll call you back in five minutes. Ciao. It's my boyfriend. He's at a bar having a drink. You wanna have a drink with him? Frank? Are you okay? - It's okay. I'm tired. - Are you having another migraine? No, I'm fine. I just have some more work I have to do at the shop. Have fun, though. - Let's have one drink. - No. - Just one. - Really. Come on. - I had a very nice evening. - Okay. Another time, I guess. Good night, Frank. Goodbye, Anna. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Go wait for me in the car, Franky. Don't just stand there. Do as I tell you! Go wait for me in the car, goddamn it. Franky! - Hey guys. - Hey. Good show. - Do you think? - Absolutely. - Really? - It's great. Are you serious? One second. - Hey Frank, I'm so happy to see you. - Hello Anna. - You look stunning. - Thank you. - Really, you're beautiful. - Thank you. I just feel like I'm in a carnival costume. This heels make me walk like an ostrich. - I'm happy you made it, though. - Me too. - Your photos are breathtaking. - Thank you. The way you made the mannequins come to life at the projections. - Yeah. - It's you, right? Yeah, it's me. My face on your mannequins. - Will you excuse me for a moment? - Yeah, sure. You lose something? Anna loves to hang out with her gay friends. I guess it's a way for a man never have to worry about trying to fuck her. You're the mannequin guy, right? Lemme ask you something. Did you play with dolls when you were a kid? - I'm not gay. - What? Good talk. A famous person once said: An artist is somebody who produces things, that people don't need. You know... Your work might interest another client of mine, whose general theme is destruction of completely useless objects. I'm sure he'd love to smash up some of your mannequins at his next photoshoot. I'm in restoration. So tell me, Fred- How does the restoration process take place? Do you go dumpster diving, department stores garbage bins in search of used parts? They're antiques. You wouldn't find them in dumpsters. Honestly, I just find the whole thing really creepy. You and Anna are the perfect fit. - Do you have a card? - No. - Let me see if I have a pen. - Dominique! Gorgeous! - Any buyers? - A few offers. But don't worry, the real money's in New York. Okay? - Okay, should I call you a cab? - No, I don't live far. I think I'll walk. - I can call you a cab. - No, no, no. You go have fun, fun, fun. - Okay. - And congratulations. - I'll call you tomorrow. - Bye, sweetheart. - What's wrong with you? - I guess I... Why do you always have to do this? - Welcome back. - It's nice to see you. - Hey Jimmy. Have you been good? - Excellent. Changing your makeup and hair style didn't fool me. You didn't think I'd recognize you? Why? 'Cause you think I'm stupid? Why do you act like I don't exist? I never wanted to hurt you. But you made me. Didn't you? Yes. Yes, you did. Did you need to be with all of them? Huh? Did you? Was it the money? Answer me! You knew, they didn't love you. Not like I loved you. Not like me. I still love you. You know that? Please don't kill me. - Please don't kill me. - Oh. I'm not gonna kill you. I'm gonna keep you. Mommy. You will not go out tonight. Is that clear? You will stay home with me. Hey, it's Anna. Leave a message after the tone. Hi Anna. It's Frank. I'm sorry to bother you at this hour. I just wanted to know how long you wanted to keep the mannequins. I have another client... Anna? What's wrong? Are you okay? Rita, my agent... She was murdered last night in her apartment. Murdered? Oh my God. Police just called me, asking me so many questions. Someone broke into her place. They must have been waiting for her. Frank, it's awful. I can't believe it. I swear it's a nightmare. You shouldn't be alone now. Is your boyfriend with you? No. He's back in New York already. Do you need company? - No, it's okay. - No, don't be silly. It's no bother. That's what friends are for, right? - I don't wanna trouble you with this. - Anna, I'll be there in 30 minutes. I know. Me too. I miss her too. It's been a long time. I'm gonna get her back. I promise. Come in. I didn't hear the intercom. One of your neighbors was walking out when I got here. I saw your name on the mailbox. I hope you don't mind. I'm happy to see you. Oh, I didn't know you had company. I don't mean to intrude. Martin lives next door. - Did you guys not meet at the show? - No but I've heard a lot about you. - Martin Nunez. - Frank. He's a stylist. He's helping me with the mannequins. Yes but I'm really an actor. I actually just booked my first national, so... I don't know what that means. It's a national commercial. For Sparkle toothpaste. - See. - Ding! Alright well... I'm gonna leave you guys. I actually have an audition first thing in the morning. So, if you'll excuse me... - Oh honey. It's gonna be fine. - Thank you. Take good care of her, Frank. See you. It must've been a very long day for you. I know what it feels like to lose someone. I'm here for you, Anna. Why would your boyfriend leave for New York now? Oh, we got into such a fight after the show. It's always about him and... I don't even know what I was thinking hooking up with that guy. Really. He's such a music guy. Huh, they can be very pompous. Yeah. I'm gonna make us coffee, okay? That was the first day we met. I didn't take care of her. I was too busy talking to other people and she left by herself. Don't blame yourself. It's really not your fault. Just try to let go. I know what you need. I'm so tense. You know, hair is the only part of the body that lasts forever. I'm sorry, I can't. - I should've sent her home. - Anna. She knew what she was doing. She lived three blocks away. What were the chances of her getting attacked? Other girls were killed and you had nothing to do with them. Believe me, it's not your fault. I asked Rita needed a ride and that's when she told me. - Told you what? - Where she lived. Isn't that what you were wondering? How I knew? I was just wondering what other girls you were talking about. The girls that were mutilated and murdered. It's all over the news. Rita had the same profile. Don't you think? The police never mentioned anything about other girls. It's probably an ongoing investigation. That's why. Anna, you need to relax. - Let me massage you again. - It's okay. I- I would just rather go to sleep, okay? And we talk tomorrow. I'm very tired. Wait! I came all over across town to be with you in your time of need. Well, I would rather be alone. Please. Being alone isn't going to help you. Believe me. I know. I'm just gonna ask you to leave now. Please. What's the matter, Anna? I thought we've become friends, you and I. You sound like a stranger. Why are you scared? Anna, come. I think we need to have a little talk. Get off me. Just calm down. What are you doing? What are you doing? It seems that we need to iron a few things. You know what I mean, don't you? Come, I think we need to have a serious talk. - Get off me! - Let me explain it to you! Get off! Martin! Help me! Help! - What's the matter, Anna? - Leave me alone. Go away. Please, go away. Anna, it's me, Martin. Open the door. Anna, what's happening in there? Is everything alright? Anna, open the door. - Anna? - Martin! - Anna, where are you? - In the bathroom. Anna, open up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Open the door. Open the door! Anna! - Martin? - No, it's not Martin. It's just you and me. Now open up and let me explain! - Martin, are you okay? - Anna. It's me. What's happening? I came all across the town to be with you in your time of need. I'm sorry. Please. Let's talk first. Leave me alone! - Just go. - No. - You need to understand. - Go, please. Put the knife down. Put the knife, Anna. Put the knife down. Put the knife down! Just calm down. Calm down. Just relax, just relax. It's okay. It's okay. Okay. Patrol 19, stand by. Code 4-8. Possible suicide. Marian Avenue 728. This is 19, we're on our way. It's gonna be okay. Anna, please! Help! Help! Anna! Somebody? Wait! Anna! - Help me! - Anna. - Stop the car! - What are you doing? - Help! - No. No! No, no, no! Oh, no! Anna! Why did you do that? Didn't you understand? I just wanted to be with you. I just wanted to be with you, Anna. I never touched you. Not once. Anna, I want to introduce you to my mother. We'll be together forever, Anna. I promise. No one will separate us again. Hey Frank. - Do you like my nipples, Frank? - Shut up! God, your hands are so warm. - I'm gonna get you back, Frank. - She's lying. Please don't listen to her. Don't listen to her. Did you play with dolls as a child, Fred? You wanna take a bath? - No. - You wanna take a bubble bath? No. I do not. Now leave. Leave! Oh, Frank. What happened? I knew you were in the locker, you naughty boy. Did you like what you saw, Frank? Don't listen to them. They're lying. Frank, don't bring any other girls home. I get jealous. I'm gonna tear you to pieces, Frank. I don't even know them. They're lying. This is our home, Anna. Welcome. Welcome. This is where we live now, Anna. No, not you! Get out of here! You hear me? Get out! Don't come near her. She is mine! Do you hear me? Get away! She belongs to me! You will never understand what we feel for one another. Where is she? Where is she? Answer me! Get your hands off of me! Please. Let go. Ah, my leg!
