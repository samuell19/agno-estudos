I didn't study in Oxford, like you. I'm from local school. But, with my understanding, you're asking about your kingdom. What will the people say, they'll follow their king. These locals say that, they're indebted to you. You're born with silver spoon, sir. [Smugs] You're an intelligent one. I'm your slave, sir. [Horse neighing] Why did you stop the vehicle? They threw logs in front of our vehicle. You idiots. Hey, who did this? Idiots. Today is the end of Bheem Rao. I'll search for job at Bhujanga Rao's place. I'm not related to this one anyways.

She's not related by blood but by your husband. Come and welcome your sister. Isn't it wrong to remarry, while I'm still alive? Stop it, Poppycock! How dare you question me? Your forefather's got many wives.. Even your father married for 5 times! But I got only two wives. Am I a bargain? What if I won't agree? Will you agree or die? You can manage me, but how will you manage our people? Come and tell them that you're infertile. I'm pregnant now! No one will question you. Stop bothering and tell them that you agree. Till the real Bheem Rao comes out. Greetings, Highness. Greetings to the citizens of Rudrangi. If our lord doesn't have heirs, Rudrangi will not have future. And we can't see our Lord again.

You mad woman, get lost! - I'm not mad. I'm mad about our sir! Get lost. Sir, have a look at me! Get lost! [Music] [Sighs] Dear. Come, lord, come. You're the king of elegance and romance! What happened? Is there anything wrong with my beauty? Your beauty is lacking feminine touch. I don't understand. What's your point? Lion won't eat without hunting. It should kill the prey by hunting! And will drink the boiled blood of the prey! It'll be a perfect combo! I'm like a lion. A lady should get scared about me! The beauty will enhance with fear. If we enjoy the beauty then, it'll be wonderful! I'll sleep with you, when you prove yourself as a lady. What? Am I not a woman? - Not for now. A woman should be like a snow but not like a metal! Prove it and I'll come to you. I trusted you, but you humiliated me! You may be a lord but I'm a lady lord! Jwalabhai, I'll fire everything! I'll kill you, idiot! Meera.. I'm hungry! What is wrong with my beauty? Your beauty lack feminine touch! "Approaching, a gracefully garbed damsel, who's a likeness of the moon" "Hey, girl!"

Hey, what is this nonsense? "Meeting of eyes..." "Shiver in the spine..." "Oh Lady Divine, marvel at your radiant smile!" "All flowers have bloomed upon catching a glimpse of your smile" "She's not just beautiful, but also has an enchanting charisma" "Observe the flowers intertwined in her hair" Lady lord.. One thing, don't take it bad. - Go ahead. I'm observing you since day one, you bet him like a male! But, now beauty and feminity is being bloomed. Is it? Come here. Who the hell is he? Mallesh.. Right hand of lord. And Lord is like God to Mallesh. He's awesome, isn't it? Yes lady. - Is he married? No madam. - If he got married, I would have killed his wife. His mom raised him right! I like him! Period. "Moving like a cobra...." Beauty and feminity is being bloomed! There's alpha male here? I saw a guy, he is Mallesh. Where is he? What is this Karni? - Sir? Just crack some joke to laugh! Once upon a time a mad man left naughty horse for limp horse. What did you say? I beg you, I didn't say anything. Is everyone deaf? There's no male in this house. Isn't there anyone who proves to be a man here? She's done today. Bheem Rao is angry. She might be dead. Will she kill her now? Let's go to jungle and hunt. Once upon a time a mad man went to forest as he is not satisfied! What will he do in a forest? - You all are waste. Hey Mallesh. What is your name, Mallesh? It's the same you said milady, Mallesh. I know, but you've to answer me. What are you doing here? - Stick fight, milady. How will you enjoy while fighting with boys? We shouldn't fight with ladies milady. You will know how difficult victory is while you fight with a lady like me. Even a victory can't beat me. - Milady! What am I to your lord? [Crowd] Goddess! Goddess! To you people? - Great Goddess. Then, what else are you thinking? Fight with me. - This is wrong lady! It's wrong if you ask; but not if I ask! Close your ears everyone. I like you and I won't leave you. I'll make you lord, if you agree! Don't feel bad that you lost the game. There's another place where you should win! Only you should win there. [Smirks] What is this Karnam? Will you eat lion or deer or tiger or pork? Or else will you eat me? What you want to eat? This stops me while eating, lord. We were born to enjoy! Why are you born then? Don't know sir. Yours is boon and ours is bane. [Goat bleats] [Anklets tinkling] [Sniffs] What a beauty, Karanam. Is she a human? Will goddess roam on earth? Holy hell! He started a new story. Who are you? Where are you from? Answer fast. I'm being mad. I'll make my place yours, if you don't have one. I'll name you too.. I'll take care of you. I'll make you a land lady I'll take you to my house. Hey Karnam.. I read Ramayana and Mahabharata many times. I thought they're fools, as they fought for a woman Now, I understood. That we can fight many wars for a woman! What say? What will I say sir! You don't say anything. I'm longing to enjoy such a girl. [Brakes squeal] Idiot. - Sire.. You like sarees right! Do you know from where I got this saree? - I'll kill you Oh you fool.

You're lucky; get lost. Hey Karnam. - Sir.. Where is she? - Don't know sir! Look over there. - Okay, sir. Where did you go? I'll make you a queen. I'll take you to my house. Please come to me. Idiot! Hey, Karnam.. - Sir? I'll kill you, if she's not found. I'll not leave her. [Music playing] Sir, we reached home! Sir, we reached home. Sir, we reached home. I like her a lot. Tongues taste different And brains think different! There are different types of madness. His madness is of next level. Hey.. Husband! Husband! You're so lucky man! You look good It tastes good. What happened to him? He seems to be mad. I need to tell you something. - What happened? You may get another mistress. He'll get another one. Hey Mallesh - Sir. Come and massage my legs. You should massage my legs not his. Hey! [Snaps finger] - Beg your pardon milady. Call Mallesh by saying that, Jwalabai is calling. Milady. - Do as I say. Mallesh bro, Young ladylord is calling you. Tell her that I declined. - She'll get angry. Go. Hail you lady. Where is Mallesh? Milady, He said he'll not come. - How dare he? Even his father should come if I call him. 'Jwala..' 'Jwala..' Lady! Get down you idiot. Milady. How dare you decline my invitation. Come with me now. Come with me now. Milady, I beg you. What are you doing? No one dare to watch what's happening here.

We should treat them like us! And should give them all the respect! Hey Karanam. - Yes sir. What say? - I'm so happy. To listen this from you. Mallesh and Rudrangi come here. Come. He might have spared you; but I'll not! I'll see how you consummate your marriage. Why all these ornaments for us madam? You should live great and I should see that, brother. Sir, did a great deed in his life time - Why are you saying like that madam? Only time will answer some questions. - Our people praise sir as, God! But you.. - Take Rudrangi inside Bless us, milady! God bless you. Rudrangi.. Young mistress is calling you. [Song playing on gramophone] What's going on between you and Mallesh? He married you in childhood and now he saved you! And I should believe this, huh? What will the eyes notice? Only the heart can sense it. - Is it? You said well! How much did you love him? Express your love on him. 'Even the time separated us' 'And my pyre is firing' 'It's enough if my ashes touch my husband's feet' 'It's enough for this life' 'Even if I'm dead; I'll give life to my husband' 'I'll be his breathe' 'Forever be his breathe!'

Can't you send you wife.. to me for once? SIR! Why are you shouting? What is this, sir? Why are you behaving like this? You know his strength. If he is strong, then I'm his master! My grandpa used to say, that snake is poisonous only in head.. but you landlords are poisonous all over your body! You're a fool who doesn't value relations. Your sister calls me brother Then my wife will be your sister! Will the dog become human if it kisses a human? Fruits will be more delicious if they're pecked by birds. It'll be meaningful only if, I touch this beauty. My dear bastards. 'O' ferocious Warrior' 'O' Valiant warrior' 'Come by breaking every obstacle' Scumbag. Hey you slaves, kill him. Dear. Dear. Dear.

If you don't lower your sword, I'll shoot you. Got it? Wow, how beautiful! You fool. What are you babbling? Are you my wife or his wife? Mallesh, keep going. I'll take care. Go and run Give them way! 'O' ferocious Warrior' 'O' Valiant warrior' 'Come by breaking every obstacle' Oh no! You shameless.. You supported that slave instead of your husband? Unashamed person. Stop it. Enough of your rubbish. You'd be a thief if you rob. But will be a lord if you earn. My husband is a lord. If you kill Mallesh here, it'll be coined as injustice If you kill him in a fight, they'll call it as hunt. As you stated though! You told me that, lion won't eat without hunting. What's the price for a lion? Lion should hunt and deer should run. Mallesh should die and you should get Rudrangi. This is the plan. This is called fierceness. Did you listen to it Karnam? Birds of a feather flock together. Yes, sir, all my ears are here. Yes sir, I'm listening, And got impressed. Go and hunt my dear husband. Some will face the fight, And some will run along with the fight. But I'll lure him to fight. I'm Bheem Rao Deshmukh! Bujjamma Dear. Our grandpa got us married at an young age, And that sir is searching for us and will kill me. You'll become abandoned, Bujjamma. I took a decision. Dear. - I'll get you married to a well educated person in city. No, I'll conduct this marriage. I'll get you to safety. I lived all these years waiting for you. It's not me but my corpse will get married to another person. I'm confident on that! I'll either live or die.. only with you! [Music] "I saw your cute face after a long time" "I'm saying all the things hidden in my heart" "I'm holding your right hand after a long time" "And will never leave it" "This moment.." "I'll be happy even if I die this minute" "I'll be happy even if I die this minute" "I'll be happy even if I die this minute" "I'll be happy even if I die this minute" "I saw your cute face after a long time" "I'm saying all the things hidden in my heart" [Music] "The sky saved her soul in the stars" "And the earth filled this sand with love" "The sky saved her soul in the stars" "And the earth filled this sand with love" "Even though the sky and land are distant" "And there's no way in between them" "Love is just like moon light" "And is filling the whole world" "I'll be happy even if I die this minute" "I'll be happy even if I die this minute" "I'll be happy even if I die this minute" "I'll be happy even if I die this minute" You said that you'll lure him out. But now you're silent. If it is for challenge, This Bheem Rao will not spare anyone! All the men in Rudrangi should die. And the land should taste blood. All the women should beg me. How? Hey! Tell where Rudrangi and Mallesh are. Don't cry here, cry at our lord's feet! We'll leave you if lord tells, otherwise we'll bury you! Leave! Like that! - I'm your slave, my lord! I'm your slave, my lord! - Tell them to leave our husbands, my lord! I'm your slave, my lord! - I'm your slave, my lord! If you're so eager.. If you need your husbands and brothers to be alive! Go and search for that Mallesh And get Rudrangi to sleep with me I know that you know where he is. I hope you bloody slaves understand what I said! He is asking whether you get it or not? In English! We beg you sir. We will search for him! Bujjamma. Why did you come here? Who sent you? Did the sir send you? Even they're our people. They might kill Let's die for their sake! I'm not a lunatic brother. I'm not a lunatic but had been one That's when.. Greetings sir, Bless us. I got married and am going to my in law's house. Bless us! Bless us milady. Will be indebted to you lady. Will take leave sir. Where is Nagamani going? I'm going to my in-law's house Even you blessed me too You took my blessings; but didn't return my favour. What will you do with this beauty? You look like a pig. I should taste this beauty. That's how, it will be blissful. What say Nagamani? I'll kill you if you touch my wife. [Gasps] You died instead of killing me. He spoiled my life. He molested almost every girl here. Everyone is a victim! Except Rudrangi. Our lives are like this. It's the same if we live or die. You should live happily. Go somewhere and live happily. We will manage here. What? Why are you quiet? Where is my slave? I thought you'll drag him to here. I expected that you'll gift Rudrangi to me. What is this life? We're scared till today. It's good for us if we be courageous today. It's okay if this place becomes a graveyard. But we will not sacrifice Rudrangi to you. [Sloganeering] We will not.. We will not.. You bloody.. Hey Karanam. - Sir! It's for the first time. Rudrangi's people revolted I'll kill them all! What should we do now? Should kill with more force. Should spill more blood Rudrangi should be a graveyard today. Dear.. Where are we going? Let's go anywhere to live happily. We shouldn't leave this place. We should go back to Rudrangi That lord will kill us! If we won't our people will die. Shall we live on their blood! Stop it! Stop it! What is all this? If you reveal where Mallesh and Rudrangi are you'll be safe. If you won't reveal, lord said to smash you all. Will you reveal or not? We won't even if we die. They won't it seems, what should we do now? Let's molest them then! Hey.. I can't see this! [Music] We should fight now! "Rudrangi is calling you, Oh my warrior!" "Come just like a thunder, My precious fighter!" [Music] "In this war, just move like a fighter" "In this fight, you're the master in the ring" "The whole village is behind you" "And we won't worry as you're with you!"

And this is not his father's hard earned property Everyone along with him were born in the same way. His birth is not special! Tell him the same. To that so called, 'Lord' To that useless scumbag. Say that these are Mallesh's words! Hey milady, serve me with another piece. What happened? - You can see yourself, right. Serve me with a big one, idiot. Tell me. He killed everyone there. And you are eating here like a foodie. It's a great boon to born like you. Hey, serve me the Hard piece. Will you have some? - No, sir. I'm good. Idiot. Why the hell you have born? Yeah, what else did he said? Oh come on, sir. I can't say them. What did he say? Everyone along with him were born in the same way. What else, he blabbered Karanam? His birth is not special Tell him the same. Say that these are Mallesh's words. I swear, I didn't utter these words, sire. Your sins are way out of control, dear. Please stop now. You have to be alive, If I need this sacred thread, Oh, women. Stop your regulations! Sin! It will stop, by my word. Good Karma, will stand by my side. What else he said? He said numerous things, sire. I feel, he'll be the winner of this war. You are aware of game, Lion and Goat, right. Who will be the ultimate winner in that game? How the Goat will be winner, the Lion will be the winner. Then how this Bheem Rao will lose the game? Bheem Rao will win the game. You may a Lion, but he is also a well-trained, sire. He may well-trained. But I'm the Lord. What a man need to live? The basic common needs, Food, clothes, shelter, sire. What a man need to live? Food, sire. - From where they'll get that food? From the crops, sire. But what they need way before that? They need water, sire. How it'll be if we stop that water? I oblige you, sire. I didn't understand. Is river of Bheem Rao Deshmukh belongs to their father? No, sire. The lake belongs to Bheem Rao Deshmukh. Lord! From now on, People of Rudrangi has to live by drinking my pee. How you can take back that lake? God himself creates and kills people. I'm nothing but, God! [Gong beating] Hey Karanam, why did they stopped the lake flow? He need something, and you had it. I'm leaving this after you. Move aside. There's no Lake anymore. They stopped the water from Lake of Bheemrao to our village. If they do so, how our crops will be blossomed? How we are gonna survive? It seems we have to survive by drinking his pee. Brother, this is Summer. We can't find a single drop of water. Crops will dry, and our animals will die. Even we will also die. Guys, let's be patient. - Being patient doesn't solve our problems. Come on, let's survive by having our tears. These words are good in poetry, not in reality. This lord, has planned to woo our Rudrangi. What say, Mallesh brother? Have some water, dear. We have to be alive, right. Please forgive me, dear. What's wrong with you people? Your animals and crops will die. Your throats and you will die soon. You guys need the lake, but why are you selecting the problems? If you controlled for 5 minutes, and the moment when Rudrangi is on his bed.. [Crowd] Hey! - Lake will be on your side. What did you said? - It's Lord, Bheem Rao's word. Hey Mallesh, don't stare at me like that. I'm getting scared. Hey Karanam, say to that Lord. We may poor but we have characters. If it needed, we will leave this earth, but not our dignity. There's a proverb.. Who will suffer if you get angry on lake! You guys will suffer. Fine, I'll take your leave. I will come back again. [Engine revving] What did they said, Karanam? Did they accepted for our offer? They are being stubborn, sire. They will twirl their moustache, and will smack their thighs! It seems, Self-respect and Prestige! Prestige? Do they have that? No, it won't. After some days, they'll get to know what is more important. Then they will come to foot of Bheem Rao. Move, let's see. Oh no, chicks are dead. Crops were dead. God! what is this? [Crying] Will you give me some water, sister? I'm feeling thirsty. I feel like, I'll die by drying of my throat. Because lack of water, Grandpa was dead. Even animals were also dead. Give me some water, sister. Which mean, I'm gonna die like this, sister? Wake up, mother. I'm feeling thirsty, please get up, I'm feeling thirsty. Crops were becoming dry, animals were losing their breath. In two days, we may gonna die. As we can't able to find a drop of water. What Rudrangi? You called us as this hour? I took a decision. - What's that? I don't want to see our people shed their tears. And what we need is, Lake of Lord. And Lord wants me. What you mean? Will you sleep with him? I don't know whether this is correct or mistake. I'm not that qualified to say about mistakes.. But, what I want to say is.. I'm ready for sake of this village. It's wrong dear, please don't think about this. If Mallesh got to know about this, he will chop the head. Rudrangi.. Did you heard that Mallesh? What this Rudrangi said? I heard the decision of Rudrangi. I felt this right. If you feel wrong, kill her. How it will be called as Mistake? It's called as Sacrifice. Her Sacrifice is greater than any other sacrifices in the world. Wow! What a great word. Finally, you made it, Lord. If you wish for something, it will land at your foot, sire. That Mallesh has agreed to sleep his wife with you, sire. Why are you being so silent, sire? Sire? Sire? That Mallesh has to say this to me. As he agreed to your wish, but what's this again, sire? Will a Lion leave its prey? - No! Then how this, Bheem Rao will leave? He have to come here and submit his wife to me. Got it? Karanam, what did Lord said? You said no to him when he asked. Now, he's saying no to you, when you are asking now. What's again now? - Don't take me wrong but.. Rudrangi is existed to fulfill Lord's desire. Then who will calm his ego down? And we need Mallesh for that. Mallesh has to enter into the Palace.. and he have to beg him. Then you guys will receive the lake. Brother Mallesh, the cobra bite may have a remedy, but not Lord's bite. You don't go there. - [Crowd] Don't go.. Don't go.. Brother.. Brother.. Dear.. Go to him, dear. You will return back for sake of this village. I believe in you. [Overlap of voices] Don't stop him. My husband will go to Lord, that's it. [Overlap of voices] Sire, Mallesh is here. Who's Mallesh? Sire, the husband of Rudrangi. - Who's Mallesh? He is my dog. And that dog baited remaining dogs to bite me. What if, a stray dog does? I may leave it. Let bygones be bygones. What shall we do now? Bend your knees. Your eyes should touch my feet. I'm your slave, sire. You shameless idiot. The one who doesn't have a character. You address me without respect, huh? Will you challenge me? How dare you to use abusive language with me? How dare you to say, My birth is not special. How dare you to say, Is Village Rudrangi my father's place? Then whose place is this, wastrel? God has to be praised by devotees. Lord's has to be praised by slaves. Lord, it's a mistake. Please forgive us. My desire will be fulfilled, If your wife sleep with me. Then how my ego will be fulfilled? You have to fulfill it. - Yes, sire. I will do as you say. Recite the same. I'm born to be a slave for you. I'm born to be a slave for you. I'll let my wife sleep with you, my Lord. I'll let my wife sleep with you, my Lord. I'll give whatever you want. I'll give whatever you want. Either it maybe my life or my wife.

Every women in his family.. My foot! That's the power of Bheem Rao Deshmukh! Mallesh, you are a good boy. Go and prepare your wife like a bride and bring her to the palace. You have die in and out, by seeing your wife in my bed. I'm your slave, sir. Mallesh.. - Sir? I like you. I'm promising you. The moment when your wife enters into my bed, the water will be flown. People thirst will vanish. I'm your slave, sir. Mallesh is here. What did the Lord, said? Why aren't you talking anything? How a guy can talk who's heart filled with pain and sorrow? I will brief it for you. Lord has agreed to give back the Lake to Village Rudrangi. But, Lord want Mallesh's wife Rudrangi in his bed. Please forgive me, dear.

He shouldn't have to raise in between these ruthless walls of this palace. The only way to make her more precious is.. let her live in midst of people. And have to stay with the land. Then only, will get to know about the Humanity. Will know the value of Humans. Keep my child in Mallesh's hand, to brought and raise with these conditions. He's more than my brother.

The legs for the chair where Lord was sitting now. Those are we! Without us, he is just a waste of paper. I'm ready to demolish him. Do we live like slaves? Or else, let's clear the debt of Rudrangi by killing him. Shucks. What sort of life we had. It's just nothing to live on this planet.
