The seismic activity is increasing. I warned you, Victor Aleksandrovich. This is the geological foundation of the city. If it splits... The diamonds will be mine. Felix, why don't you say something? In an hour, the city is going to collapse. Stop the drilling! Keep on drilling! The drilling rate is decreasing. 1,800... 1,100... There's not enough power. Turn everything you've got up to the maximum. Increase reactor blocks. Reactor blocks increased. Maximum power! The drill speed is still slowing down. Five hundred rotations... Two hundred... It's stopped! Victor Aleksandrovich! Nuclear power is hopeless. We need the nanocatalyst. We'll be able to produce a million times more energy. Its deveIopment was started back in Soviet times. The project was shut down. THE ENRICHMENT PROCESS REGULAR FUEL NANOFUEL But the nanocataIyst is stiII stored in some forgotten Iaboratory. We must find that Iaboratory. PRESENT DAY What the hell is this place? It is not on the map! Damn. Is that a car? Wow. I bet we could sell it for around 10 grand. But how did it get here? I have no idea, but it's going to take a crane to pull it out. Mikhalych wanted us to report on every single thing we find. They're looking for something here, some institute or something. Vasya. - Want to split it, 50-50? - Ah! BLACK LIGHTNING Quiet, please! So, an assessment of investment in research and development is based on the correlation of the equivalent... Whoa, check out the new girl. Proportions, proportions... These proportions will require a lot of investment. Fast food won't do. Looks like a restaurant deal to me. Designer lace from Yudashkin and a ticket to a fancy show. Seven red roses. Then conversations about intellectual cinema. While in bed, of course. I seriously doubt it. Give me two weeks. I'll prove it. Hi. That's a sweet ride. Yeah, it's pretty cool. Sure would be awesome to take a ride in it. Yeah, dream on. No way! Let's go for a spin. So, where are we heading? Doesn't matter. - I'm welcome anywhere. - Cool. Hey, slow down! Hey there! What's your name? Nastya. I'm Maxim. Want a lift? I doubt you're strong enough to lift me. But yeah, I could use a lift. I told you. Oh, I almost forgot. This is Dmitry. He's my driver. Hello, driver. Hi. I was just telling Dmitry about Venice. By the way, have you been to Venice, Nastya? Mmm-mmm. - Well, we can go! - Mmm. MAX: I can book the tickets right now. As I was saying to my driver... The food was delicious! Thank you. Dad. How did you court Mom? How? I don't know. - Just like everyone does. - MOTHER: That's not true. Your father took me on the tram around the city at night. He'd drive up to the library, sound his horn and flash the headlights three times to call me out. Yeah, I remember that. MOTHER: No one had cars back then but we had an entire tram to ourselves! Well, even now, not everybody has a car. Name: Nastya Last name: Svetlova Nastya Svetlova's page is accessible to friends only Starting at 1,196,800 rubles Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Happy birthday, honey. Grow strong and be good. Happy birthday. Dance, Dima! Tanyush! You're supposed to dance when you get a letter. I know, but when you get a car you should dance, too! What car? Tanyukha, loose lips sink ships. Don't forget your driver's licence. You lose something, Dima? Hold on. Dad bought him a car! No way! Wow, he got a car! Well? I know it's not new. But if you fix it up a little, give it a new paint job, it'll be as good as new. Thanks, Dad. "Thanks," what? Did you know that Putin has the same kind of car? Will you be able to find your way to school? Happy birthday, Dima! Come on! Go for it. Good morning. Hello. Hey, Dima. This is a really cool car. Huh? Let's go. Young man, help an old man get on the bus. You are like a true Timurovich. You know, there was this writer named Gaidar. He wrote a book, Timur and his Team. They would draw stars on the gates of houses where old people lived. Can you hurry up, please? What's going on? The stars... All the diamonds in the world are there for the taking. LECTURER: VICTOR KUPTSOV It's not the hardness of the soil, it's simply how determined you are. If you're not ready to be the first, you'll be the last. And here's the living proof. I apologise. A stranger asked me for help and the bus ended up leaving. Asked for help. I have a question. Who would have done otherwise? Who would not have helped a stranger in order to get to my lecture on time? Fine. Let's change the situation. You have to defend your thesis. You are late. Then what? Good. Let's take it even further. I will give a million to anyone who would not help a stranger in order to be on time for my lecture. Thank you. Young man, the voting is now closed. It's over. I just wanted to ask... Could I get a million now and then not help someone next time? Sure. That's my end of the bargain. Now it's your turn. Thank you. The lecture is over. Victor Aleksandrovich! Please take it back. I was just kidding. But I wasn't. The important thing is, you got the point. You can only count on yourself. Take it back, please. You're alone in this world and nobody will help you. And you don't need to help anyone, either. Calling an ambulance is free of charge. Please, take the money back! MAX: Nastya, let's go. He has other things to do now. Millionaires have their business, and we have ours. Such a beautiful girl. But she gets into another man's car. Do you at least have a car? See? Maybe you should take the money. Buy yourself a Mercedes. You can drive your girl around. Or maybe you're right. After all, I started from nothing, too. How did you start from nothing? I sold flowers. How much money can I make? You think you can deliver flowers? You join hearts together, like a surgeon. You can't put a price tag on it. How much can I earn? If you're quick enough, you'll make money. Hey, watch where you're going! Young man, wait for me, please! I'll send the elevator back down to you. Hey, wait! Yes! Victor Aleksandrovich, I've checked everything. It's the very same laboratory. The nanocatalyst is in there. Victor Aleksandrovich, what's next? KUPTSOV: The sky will be filled with diamonds, that's what. - Hello, Felix Petrovich! - Hello, Victor Aleksandrovich. So, what do we have here? The nanocatalyst is not here but there is one container of nanofuel left. Is this enough for what we need? I don't know, Victor Aleksandrovich. We'll need to do some research. The catalyser is here. It's in this car. Where is the car? What car? GAZ-21! How could it get underground? We'll find it, Victor Aleksandrovich. Is that it, Bahram Mamedovich? For a week of work? As the saying goes, slow and steady doesn't win the race. You gotta move your ass, Maykov. Dima, wait. I need you to give me a lift. - Dad, I can't. - Why? I need to go and pick up flowers. Well, let's do it together, then. MAN: What's the problem? I have all the papers. The registration certificate and... What are you looking at in there? What have we got here? This isn't it. It's just rust. Let's go, then. What happened? Close the hood. Retro is in style now. I read about a man who sold a '38 Bentley for a fortune. Well, that was a Bentley. They have their history and we have ours. My bag! Help me! Dad, don't interfere! Help me! Give it back! Thank you! Apologise to her! Go to hell! Why do you always meddle? People can sort things out themselves. Let's go, I have to work. Work can wait, busy man. Look, a Volga! Follow it! I'll kill you, you bastard! That's life. You can't change the world. Have you ever tried? That attack could have been gang-related. They'll find you and no one will help you. But you will, won't you? Dad, you're like an old tram. Just rolling and rolling along, stuck in your own tracks! Stop the car. Take care. Should we follow that man? No. We might lose the Volga. I told him not to interfere. Now there's going to be trouble! - Turn here! - We'll take a shortcut. Cheers! DIAMOND TOWER BORIS: That's what happened, Victor. It flew away? Yes, it did. A car? A car. In the air? In the air. Could it have lifted off the ground going over a bump? It could have. On top of a roof. A flying car. What a stupid use for the nanocatalyst. Those damned romantics! How should they have used it? We must start drilling! Victor, I promise that I'll find... How are you going to find it? Flowers. There were a lot of flowers in that car. We'll check out all the flower shops. Flowers... One, two, three, four! Whatever. I'm not playing with you any more. - Give up? - No, I don't. It's my move. Hey. Why don't you go change? Dad, where did you get that car? Why? Doesn't it work? Dad, it flies! What? Be careful, my dear. There are so many accidents. Dad, it really does fly. So everything turned out great for you, businessman. The boy is studying and working. He's going through a tough time. You ought to talk to him. Median are items in the middle. In statistics, the median is the middle value in a series.

It turned out that the crystal was capable of altering the chemical composition of substances. We created a device that increased the energy of fuel a million-fold. We called it the nanocatalyst. It was invented by Mikhail Yelizarov. We hoped that it would help us create a unique type of engine that would allow any automobile, any machine, to fly up in the air. But we were wrong. The Volga didn't take off. What do you mean, it didn't take off? That can't be true. I personally carried out the tests that resulted in complete failure. That's it. Our project was shut down. Yelizarov left. Young man, may I see your credentials? You know, I have to go now. I have to go. What fuel do you use... I mean, did you use in your Volga? We used regular gasoline. The nanocatalyst would charge and convert fuel into nanofuel. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. What if the nanocatalyst was turned off? What would happen? For such a case, there is a reserve container of nanofuel in the car. It would be enough for 30 minutes of flight. Take care! - Dmitry. - Huh? I'll give you this manual. It was written by Yelizarov himself. It contains all the details about the car. Thank you very much. Olya! Goodbye. Goodbye. Thanks a lot! We created a device that increased the energy of fuel a million-fold. We called it the nanocatalyst. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello, Bahram Mamedovich! "October 19, 2009. "Dmitry Maykov received four bunches of red tulips, "two baskets of white chrysanthemums, "and six baskets of tea roses." Where did they go? Bahram, it just so happened... Article 160. "Misappropriation and embezzlement "is punishable by imprisonment for up to six years." I'll work it off! As usual, the streets are packed with cars and the city is at a standstill. l don't suggest you take the subway, either. Yes, Bahram. They're waiting for flowers at Russky Standart. What can I do? I'm stuck in traffic! I don't care! Am I supposed to fly or what? You'd better be there on time! Got it. I'll be there. - With flowers! - Okay. Not like last time! "Instruction manual." Let's see, seatbelts... Those are for weaklings. "In order to switch into service mode, pull the Y key "and click it sharply back into place." Attention all units! Motor vehicle theft reported... Fire reported at... To hell with it. "Activate the lower boosters for a vertical take-off, "using switches five "and nine. "The intensity of the front and the back engines can be adjusted "using the right and left pedals, respectively." It's all clear now. Oh, my God! l must have missed something. "For take-off, push both pedals "simultaneously." WINGS Dad, can cars fly? No, son. Unfortunately, they can't. Landing, landing... "Emergency landing. "ln case of a system failure while in flight, "the emergency parachute will open." What parachute? Where's "landing"? "Switch eight is used to extend the landing gear." Damn, where's switch eight? Good afternoon. I'm here to deliver the flowers. Please, sign here. Is the TV out of order? Yes, it is. Check the antenna. Thanks a lot! - Have you been there? - No. And there? Bahram Mamedovich, there's a traffic jam. What do you mean, a traffic jam? We're not in the mountains, we're in Moscow. I'll fire you! This is yours. How come you're so quick? Because I'm not a tram. Sure. Dima is looking good! - Hi. - Hi. Nastya, I downloaded some music to my iPhone. Wait. Damn! The battery is low. We'll listen to it another day. Want to watch a cool video? You have an iPhone? Yeah. That's crazy! Where did you get it? Bought it. Didn't you buy a car yet? The iPhone is obsolete anyway. I want to get a Vertu. Texting on an iPhone isn't easy, and the battery is weak. Let's go out someplace That's unexpected... Let's go somewhere unexpectedly It's an interesting place. Do you come here often? I... Well, how do I put it... Are you ready to order? I'll have the usual. I'm sorry? Well, the first course, second course... I'll have the same. I will leave it to yourjudgement. Actually, this is my first time here. There are no restaurants like this in Nizhni. Aren't you from Moscow? No, I just rent an apartment here. So, you're independent. Maybe. I live with my parents. That's not bad. Yeah, it's okay. Here's to our date! Have you started preparing for the exam? Let's study together. I'll help you. Well... It's easy, I'll explain everything. What happens if you fail? Then I will have to go back to Nizhni. It won't happen. I'll help you. Let's go now. What about dessert? Let's go. Good evening! Good evening, Victor Aleksandrovich. This is a lovely place for dinner. - I'll wait outside. - Okay. Goodbye! I wanted to thank you for your advice. What advice? You told me the other day at university that it's every man for himself. And that's what I'm doing. Very good! You've got the right idea. Thank you, Victor Aleksandrovich. Goodbye. Goodbye! You forgot the flowers! Flowers. I noticed you at that lecture, do you remember? I noticed you, too. (TRAM BELL RINGING) Three horn signals and three flashes. "Come on out." You know, that's how my father would invite my mother on a date. Is your dad a tram driver? Yeah. Once I have a car, I'll invite you the same way. Will you come? We'll see. Here we are. This is where I live. Yeah? A pity... And this is dessert. Hey! Hello. You're making good progress, student! I should be getting more. More money? Only I make more than you. Less, actually! Bahram Mamedovich, what if the competition lures me away? What competition? You and I don't have competition! To hell with the competition! They would come and say, "Who's driving a Volga? "He makes more deliveries than the others." Nobody will come! We'll see, we'll see. Excuse me. Fresh, beautiful flowers! Come and buy. We deliver flowers in Moscow and the Moscow region. I'm all ears. Tell me, friend, who's driving a Volga? Delivering flowers? What Volga? There's no Volga. Are you sure? Nobody is driving a Volga. Dima, it's me. Look, we thought it over and we'll give you a raise. No. Why now? Starting next month. It's a dead end. It was the last address. I hope we don't become dead ends. Remember the man getting out of that Volga? With grey hair? He had a scuffle with a thug. - So? - I know that guy. He hangs around my neighbourhood. Did you take Nastya to a restaurant? I did. Go and seduce a waitress and take her for a ride on a tram. Nastya is mine, got it? You can't afford her. Okay, give it a rest. So did you do "it" with her? Yeah, so! We went to a restaurant and went on from there! You think you're the only one with money? - Hi, Dad. - Hi, Dima. Things shouldn't go on like this. We should talk. Pick me up after work. We'll talk on the way home. l'll be waiting at the bus stop. Okay, okay. Take care. This is the guy! Excuse me. Hello. Can I ask you something? Do you recall who drove you here in a Volga a couple of weeks ago? Relax, old man. We just need that guy. What's the matter? Excuse me, I'm in a hurry. He's hiding something. Is it him? No. How come? It's not him. Are you playing games with us? Sorry, my mistake. I have to go, guys. Excuse me. - My mistake. - Asshole. Hey, old man! What do you want? I wanted to apologise. Yes, Bahram? Yes, but for an extra fee. I took it to her already. Young man! Yes, today. Young man, can you help? Someone is hurt! Excuse me, can you help? Calling an ambulance is free of charge. Dad! Dad! Dad! I'm sorry. Had we been called sooner... You will replace Dad now. You'll wash dishes... Help everyone... Like he did. Dad! Dad! But you will, won't you? Young man, can you help? Someone is hurt! Calling an ambulance is free of charge. Vyatka, 211just arrived. Profsoyuznaya street, 138. 341, Vyatka. Start the rescue operation. 341. We are on the way. My son! My son is in there! Let me through! ...a child on the seventh floor... Mom! Look! What is that? Attention! Clear the way! The cold's colouring your cheeks. Block the road. Proceeding to arrest. Any injuries? Apparently not. I think it was a homemade car. I saw two engines. Something black flew by. It was coming from there. This is probably a citizen who wants to help fight organised crime. This is outrageous. What if I'm walking and it comes and scoops me up into the air? What's up with that? I don't get it. Hey! Hey! Stop! I've got everything in there! MYSTERIOUS DEFENDER OF THE CITY UFO HELPS FIREMEN FLYING JUSTICE THEY CALL HIM "BLACK LIGHTNING" BLACK LIGHTNING PEOPLE'S HERO BLACK LIGHTNING FASTER THAN FIREMEN Let's start with a sensational news story. A spectator was able to take a unique picture of a flying car during a fire in a student area of Moscow. lt has been referred to as "Black Lightning." You can see this very rare shot on your screen. Judging by the picture, a young male is behind the wheel. The car disappeared as quickly as it came, so we have little information about the event. We have no answer to the question burning in our minds: who is this mysterious youngster? He appears to be going to extraordinary lengths to preserve his anonymity... "Little Humpback quivered. He stood on his feet and shivered. "He shook his mane, and with a neigh, "like an arrow he sped away." Dima. Yes? Does Black Lightning exist? Yes. That's good. Dima? What? I know who Black Lightning is. Who? It's Dad. Despite all efforts, the search for Black Lightning... Firemen and police trying to find a guy in his twenties... Borya! No need to look for Black Lightning. Why not? He will find us instead. Online Friends My Friends Black Lightning Volga 21 Helping others l saw you rescuing a boy from a fire. I'm astonished. Anyone would do the same. Many people are vain and only think about themselves. Have you learned that from experience? Unfortunately, yes. We all make mistakes. Should we learn to forgive? Some things are unforgivable. You're probably right... Urgent message Cops are chasing an armoured vehicle here in Novokosino. Looks like a robbery. Now I've got you, hero. You're going down! Go! Go! Faster! According to witnesses, the stolen police car ended up on this roof courtesy of Black Lightning, most likely as a warning to the criminals of our city. Victor. He's impossible to catch. We're on the ground and he's in the air. So we catch him in the air. How? Who invented that car? The information's classified. I spoke to some of my people, but unless the inventors decide to show up on their own... Well... Find them, Boris. Welcome back to the show. Today, we're discussing the story that made headlines in all of the national newspapers. During the commercial break, we were joined by Alina and Volodya... How, Pasha? You ran the tests yourself... So Yelizarov was right? This is nonsense. It landed on the roof of the Hotel Moskva... So this is nonsense, too? Hello, Moskovsky Komsomolets? I'd like to know when the article will appear. Yes, about our invention. What am I talking about? The flying Volga. I told your reporter everything. You didn't send anyone? Are you insane? I'll go there myself. Okay, I'm off. Good luck, son. Break a leg! Thank you. Stupid. Tanya, don't say that about your brother! But we need to call him names so that he gets an A. There are 11 applicants left. Only 10 will be accepted. Unfortunately, one of you will not pass. You must focus! DIAMOND TOWER CREATORS OF BLACK LIGHTNING ARE ALIVE Speak of the devil! Yelizarov, Romantseva, Perepelkin... Perepelkin concealed the successful results of their tests. The project was shut down. Yelizarov was fired. Afterwards, Perepelkin married Romantseva. He travels by air, and so will we. I need those three. Will they agree to work for us? KUPTSOV: The government is revisiting the work you started 40 years ago. The Volga equipped with the nanocatalyst is now being used in the special project known as "Black Lightning." As we speak, the paperwork is being processed for your nomination for the nation's highest honour. Now, let's get down to business. The situation in our country is difficult. Crime rates are on the rise. So far, Black Lightning is proving insufficient. We need to create a modern, armed version of Black Lightning. You are being given this automobile to develop a prototype. I request that you all take an active role in this work. We promise there will be no delays in the financing of this project. Let's get started! Olga, are you ready? We are. Right, Misha? Unfortunately, we cannot create another nanocatalyst. First, we'll try to use the fuel that was already charged in the nanocatalyst. But it might not be enough. It will be enough for a few hours. Great! It will be enough then. Let's not waste time, shall we? You must start working right away. I hope nothing will distract you this time. Oh, I forgot to introduce Boris Ivanovich. He will supervise this project. Pleasure to meet you. I must warn you that you're not allowed to leave the site for the duration of the project. Please hand in your cell phones. STUDENTS WHO PASSED THE ECONOMICS EXAM Nastya, Nastya! And you didn't think you could do it! Listen... Congratulations! I passed, too! We should celebrate! Can you believe it? I got the question about... So who didn't pass? Maykov. That's impossible! He had the first question and he didn't write anything. What happens if you fail? Then I will have to go back to Nizhni. It won't happen. I'll help you. Are we going out to celebrate tonight? Max? Dima! You knew everything. What did I know? You were more prepared than anyone. I just don't want you to leave. Yes, flower delivery? I'd like to order seven roses. No, 15! How much? Well, make it five, then. What do you think, does Black Lightning have a girlfriend? Of course. I wonder what she's like. Would you like to trade places with her? Uh-uh. To be honest, yes. Why? Because someone has to protect him. I feel sorry for him. He must be very lonely. He can't talk to anyone... I think that something bad happened to him and he decided to help others. And now people can walk around with nothing to fear. Because he's always close. You and he have a lot in common. - There are a lot of copycats now. - Hmm? - Nastya. - Uh. Where are you celebrating the New Year? I don't know yet. Let's celebrate together. All right. Well, I have some shopping to do. Bye. To Nastya, Love Max. CELEBRITIES "A famous singer wants to sell his Bentley "and buy Black Lightning." "A socialite wants Black Lightning "to save her from loneliness." Everybody is going crazy over Black Lightning. Max, is there anything you want to tell me? Well... For a while... You can trust me. You see... I've never told anyone before. Is it dangerous? No, why? I just have to find the right words... But you saved my life! And you pretend that nothing happened. - I... - I know who you are. Who? Black Lightning. You can't tell anyone. Where are you celebrating the New Year? You have to go now, don't you? I do? Where? Well... The situation is complicated because the shoreline of the reservoir is covered with ice. Rescue boats can't get to the men. Emergency response teams were called to the scene. Of course. However, the dozens of people who have gathered are waiting for Black Lightning. Gotta go. There were no casualties, thanks to the help of... Dima! You missed it. There was a report about Black Lightning. It's okay. I'll look it up on the Internet later. I'll look it up on the Internet now! He was rescuing some fishermen. Mom, I invited a girl, Nastya, to spend New Year's Eve with us. Is that okay? Son! You're all grown up. Here. For Nastya. It's beautiful. Your father gave it to me when he first told me he loved me. The house is a mess and the guests are coming soon. I have to tidy up now. For SALE: Volga GAZ-21. 1966. Good condition. Price negotiable. Hello. Happy New Year! I'm calling about the Volga. Yes, I know that you sold it already. I'd like to talk to the previous owner, please. At work? What street? Can I help you? What is this place? Are you looking for someone? Yes, I'm looking for someone. Step aside. Open the gate. Dima? What are you doing here? Did you earn your first million? Do you remember when we talked about choice? About whether I should help myself or others? Yes, I do. What happens to those people that no one helps? That's their problem. And if they die? Then they were weak. What if you need help? Leave a message after the beep. Bye! Hi, Nastya! I've been trying to reach you for two days. Let's meet at the university party and then go to my place. All right, bye. MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER: Installation of the navigation system is complete. Prepare for installation of heat-seeking missiles. Attention, chemical testing of the nanofuel is about to begin. Have you really been waiting for me all these years? Really. I didn't know. Otherwise... You wouldn't have disappeared for 30 years? BORIS: Felix, there's one thing I don't understand. If there's a diamond deposit right under our feet, then why is nobody extracting the diamonds? FELIX: To reach it, we must drill through the foundation on which this city stands. And it's impossible. BORIS: How are we going to do it? With the nanocatalyst. Ah, so that's why we need it. FELIX: We'll have to leave Moscow for a while, though. My friends, there's a giant drill inside this building. Kuptsov wants to destroy the geological foundations of Moscow. He's searching for diamonds. But, Pasha, that's impossible. There's no sufficient source of energy. There is. The nanocatalyst. That's why he needs this Mercedes. Instead of helping Black Lightning, he wants to destroy it and get the nanocatalyst. If the foundation cracks, buildings will collapse. Millions of lives will be lost! He's insane! We have to do something! We have to call for help, sound the alarm! We have to stop him! I'll try to get out of here and get help. Why you? You'll stay with Olga. The nanocontainer has been installed. The armoured vehicle is ready for launch. Launching armoured vehicle. Stop or I'll shoot! Victor Aleksandrovich, Perepelkin is on the roof! Leave him alone. Let him stay on the roof. Why? Because this is our chance to get the nanocatalyst. The news about the man on the roof is going to make all the headlines. When? Now! - Love! - Make love your homepage! Add it to your favourites! Love forever! We have breaking news that one of the creators of the legendary Black Lightning, Pavel Perepelkin, is now on the roof of the high-rise building known as Diamond Tower. According to witnesses, he is shouting for help. Our correspondent is already on his way to the site. Stay tuned for more updates. Sorry, I have to go. Be careful. Hey! Are you ready to go? My mom can't wait to see you. - Dima. - Hmm? I'm here with Max. Do you love him? You have to understand. He's different. He saved my life. He helps people. We thought we knew him, but we didn't. I asked if you love him. Dima. Max is Black Lightning. No. Max is not Black Lightning. He is not Black Lightning. Our correspondent is arriving at the tower now. Mikhail, what's happening there? Look, Max will come and save him now. The man on the roof of the Diamond Tower has not yet been identified... No, he won't come. I bet he won't come. ...and how he ended up on the roof, since the building is not even finished. We're sitting here while a man might be dying, and only Max can help him. Who is in the tower now? The security guard refused to grant us access and the owners of Diamond Tower are not available for comment. You're right. He will be there. He must be there. Pavel Vladimirovich! What happened? Kuptsov! He wants the nanocatalyst! He wants to destroy the whole city to find the diamonds! Our correspondent has just informed us that Black Lightning has just appeared over Diamond Tower. The mysterious hero has come to the rescue again. We're still waiting for more details, but one thing is clear, nothing will ruin the celebrations tonight. Speaking of which, the new year has come to Vladivostok. The drill is in the subway tunnel below. Get in! Only you can... Get out of here! Black Lightning is no more. What would I do without you, dear scientists? Well, I will show you now what your nanocatalyst is capable of. Okay, you romantic morons, keep grinding away at your studies. Carousel, Carousel... You're an amazing, fantastic person. Your secret will always be safe with me. But I have to be honest with you... I love someone else. I'm sorry. Yes? Dima, where are you? l have to tell you something very important. l'll come to you. Wait for me. I can't wait to see you! Okay, I'm on my way. NANOCATALYST DISCONNECTED! What if the nanocatalyst was turned off? For such a case, there is a reserve container of nanofuel in the car. lt would be enough for 30 minutes of flight. Misha. Do you know why our Volga failed to fly back then during the tests? No. I still don't understand. I did it. I wanted to separate you and Olga. I suddenly realised that one person is more important to me than any Nobel Prize. Dima, turn off the nanocatalyst! It's up there! DRILLING INTERRUPTED lf Kuptsov gets his hands on it, the city will be lost. The catalyser should be destroyed. How? I'll connect the poles and it will destroy itself. In two seconds, it will all be over. Dima, you were talking about choice. Well, you got the nanocatalyst. But I got your girl. The choice is yours. Wait! Don't believe him! He's bluffing! - Hello? - Nastya? - Yes. - Are you okay? Where are you? Oh, my God! What is this? What? Hello? Hello, Nastya? Hello? Hello, Nastya? Season's greetings! Nastya, l can't hear you!

Three horn signals and three flashes. "Come on out." What do you think, does Black Lightning have a girlfriend? Of course. I wonder what she's like. Come on! Who do you think you're messing with? Come on! Overload Ah. - Hi, Mom. - Dima, where are you and Nastya? You're taking too long. The New Year came already. And you didn't even call! Are you coming or not? Sorry, Mom. Everything's fine.
