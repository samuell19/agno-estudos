This story begins with Lemmy ringing me up one morning and saying, listen, Jamie, meet me at the ferry. I could hear something in his voice, like he's got something really big to tell me. So when he says, forget school, just meet me OK. I do. Lemmy. I say to Lemmy, but Lemmy, it's only a week to school search. We can't afford to keep wagging and to just hang around talking about film stars and hairdos, stuff like that anymore. But Lemmy doesn't listen. He's got something big on his mind. Rangitoto Auckland's most recent volcano exploded only 800 years ago. It was once a "tapu place", burial ground for the dead in times of war. It was a lookout. And in the last Depression, prison labor was used to help build the roads. Now the entire surface of Rankitoto Island is lava, jagged and broken up. Basil, the black rock sourced to very high temperatures. So it's an inhospitable island with little topsoil, water or shelter. Come on. Let him take off. With better luck of find death in the interior? Don't believe leave this place Lemmy. Talk about and civilize... - Oh. - There isn't even a dairy. Really? But at least I'm prepared. What a tragedy. Oh, no. Hey, you know what, Lemmy? Mum and dad say I shouldn't be seeing you. Why not? Why not? I don't know. You know, you're a bad influence. So firm, so clear. So natural. Easy. Now you are here with me. Truly, this is first day of my life. This is first day of my life. This is how he met in violence. Brand the mommy's boy. Take this fat boy. Tasty. Everyone who never love. Everyone who never dream. - Worried about school cert Lemmy. - Give me a break. What is it then? Don't go so fast. What's the race, Lemmy? The only one who ever loved Bomb. The only one who ever dreamed. What are you going to do when you left school, Lemmy? I haven't decided yet. Why? I'm going to leave New Zealand as soon as I can. I'm going to be a famous dress designer in Paris. I'm already doing designs after school for my first collection. I think the colossa just the pits. But I really like those dresses. The ones the title on the hips. Sequins knitting around the bottom like Jane Mansfield used to wear. When she still had her head. You could come with me to Paris, Lemmy. Gotta be lots of fun better than here. You know, actually Bumpshead, he likes doing rude things in the changing shed. He's... repulsive. Hey, I know what. Why don't we go to town on Friday night?

I was six foot three of them giving me the glad eye. So I dropped everything quick, smart and fell into a changing room. And so helped me God, I got down on my knees and started porch swinging him. Because demon had sex was upon me and I just couldn't keep a control to myself. I cried out of the Lord. I just can't keep a control of myself, so help me God. Lemmy, such as scream. I don't believe you, Lemmy Stevenson. I just don't believe you. What? Bristol is not one of them. He can't be. Telling me. Don't forget there's only. One boat back and we have to be on it. We've only got about an hour. Let's go outside and watch the thunderbill. As much sweating as I can stand. I mean, I want to get it. So much and really I don't know what mom and dad would say. No if I didn't get school cert. Lemmy. I think we've got a live one. Well, no Friggy Friggs. So now it's our turn to teach him. Come on, Mummies. Boy. Being good isn't easy when you're here here with me. - It is your down. - You gonna be dead. What if he has died, Lemmy? What if he has died? I must have put the ticket somewhere. Maybe you'll kill me. Bring your frigging boom for free. It doesn't cost nothing. French fries will bum you for free. Spend the weekend with them. Doesn't cost nothing. - It doesn't make you a homo. - It does. Stupid, of course. Go ask your cats first. But it doesn't prove you French. Are you a homo, Jamie? Me? Mother find suicide son. Are you a homo, Jamie? No. For exist waiting, Jamie. Not in your usual place, Jamie. Where it rains. Is that sir? Homo. Insult. Insult. Page 25. We have a little treat in store for us. We shall have one of the boys who has the nicest softest voices in the entire school reading for us. All right. Speak up. Visited... Listen, boys to hear soft voices. No. Your emphasis is all wrong. Taught. Taught. Repeat after me. Taught. I'm waiting. Who can say this? Anyone. And so I lost my voice. I swore I'd never speak again except to Lemmy. I got sick of growing up. I didn't want to anymore. Why? Because I doesn't like him. Why not? Because he's not a good influence. He's not a bad influence. He's just not bad influence? No chance. Let me sugest. A bad influence on the... And we don't want you to see. He's my friend of mine. But he's my friend. He's my special friend. We don't jade. We don't think he's having influence. Die without Lemmy, mom. Die. I'll die. I'll die. A cigarette. They can separate us. That's what they say. That's what they think. It doesn't make any difference. When I call you up I'll put in the voice. You can do the same for me. I won't even notice. Really, Lemmy? What do you think, Lemmy? We'll both just pretend to be someone else? Hey, that would be difficult. Hey. Whatever. Hey, Lemmy. Hey, Jamie. Sort of like Auckland's Eiffel Tower, Lemmy. It doesn't look so bad from up here. What do you reckon? What are you thinking about, Lemmyy? Nothing. Nothing much. She was playing Glenn Miller. Glen Miller? On the radiogram. Oh no. Your mother... not Moonlight Serenade. What was it this time? Stuck a hidden? Heaven again. Pills. Poor mother. Are you? Lemmy. I have to do still set. I can't just be nothing. I might not get to be a Paris designer. I might get to Paris. I don't want to end up in a factory. Really' I'd die, Lemmy. And kill me. They'd kill me. Get lost, why don't you? No, Lemmy. That's the wrong way. We'll miss the boat. We'll be back stuck all night.
