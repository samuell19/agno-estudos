It has its chemical formula But we do not need to know this Plastid is irreplaceable It's a necessary item in equipement of every paratrooper The question, why First, in this condition It's absolutely safe, easy to store and always available As they say, in the hand But in war It is very efficient and has enormous destructive power But you've got to be skilled, for using it Warrior... There are two simple rules First ,the more you squeeze it, the more it blows Number two, don't stick it everywhere! But by itself this thing won't work For it to blow we need what? Detonator Exactly We need to insert detonator Your name soldier? Private Petrovsky You screwed, soldier l've got to report to your commander Come in Comrade lieutenant, private Petrovsky Come in Well molded, quite realistic Can you paint? I learned painting A portrait, kinds of big I could I'm here..., The girl's writing... We met before the war She wants my photo What am l gonna do? Send it with this? Can you , like... Without it...

I misunderstood, sir Then tell me what's it all about ! I also wanna share you joy You can swallow your snots Can call your mama Piss your pants, but your mission Must be accomplished, Die but do it , and he did Turn back Basic knowledge of your communication with locals You can get from this But The first thing, you should rember when you cross the border That you're in a muslim state Islam it's not merely another religion It's another world which has its own laws Another approach to live and death Muslim doesn't afraid to die fighting the infidel, in other words - us If he gets killed he goes straight to heaven Where all he was missing in this life awaiting him there Water The fruits in the garden, beautiful maids How Muslims treat women it's another topic The most important holy thing for muslim is his house, Harram From which derived the word Harem The second meaning of it - "forbidden", "prohibited" Looking at the muslim women is Harram Everything regarding sexual intercourse is Harram Harram to show a muslim indecent gestures Those you all are so used to them For this you can get a bullet even from a common peasant Another important thing, Muslim will never profane That means when you enter their village, you are To kill a guest even an infidel - harram So, you must remember this one As long as you're in the villige, you are safe. But after you crossed the borderline of the villige The same man, who's been drinking tea with you 5 minutes ago May shoot you in the back Because it is a glory to kill an infidel It is a staircase to heaven. I'm telling it for you, soldier Ah... After all, Afghanistan is a multinational country. Over 20 nations live there. Tajiks Turkmen, Uzbeks Pushtuns live along the Pakistani border In the north, live Khazarss and Mongoloids The word khazar means thousand in Turkic languages. Am I boring you, soldier? Comrade captain, Does it matter who you shoot? During the whole history No one ever succeded to conquer Afghanistan No one, ever Squad, Get up What are we doing in Afghanistan? Fulfilling our international incumbency, to resist the aggression of imperialism. Fire! Private Ryabokon, done! Private Chugainov, done! Right down You pull the trigger too sharp Very dense, but too high Breath slowly. OK Have you ever shot before? No sir, I'm a painter, l have a very accurate eye Over here. Ok Give him. Private, Vorobyov Yes Put down the gun and come here. Yes, sir! Here. Put it there. Yes, sir! Run! Oh, cool, Gioconda Cool! Listen, Gioconda, tell me honestly. Why did you come to Afghanistan?

Afghanistan, Chaugani, February 9th 1989 We were leaving Afghanistan. We, the 9th company. Have won our own war. Back then, we hadn't known a lot of things We hadn't known, that two years later the country we had been fighting for And wearing the medals of non existing country will become unfashionable. We hadn't known that Lieutenant Dygalo And train recruits somewhere near Tula He will die of a stroke, a year later During a night march. We hadn't known that Snow White with her mother and lots of Will stay in the abandoned army city on the Afghani border And we ourselves will be scattered ruthlessly, by the new life. Some to the top, and some to the very bottom. Non of this we hadn't known then. We even Hadn't known that we were simply forgotten On that remote height. We were leaving Afghanistan... The 9th company We, we won.
