So where are you? Okay. Stay calm. You're in a room. What else? Right, whatever you do, you have to promise to stay calm. And please, just don't shut me off. Okay? Your name is Laura Green. You're 19 and you live in Mire, a small town in Somerset. You're single and sell antiques. We are the same person. I am you. You had an accident a few months ago and as a result you have dissociative amnesia. In normal speak, that means that we can't remember shit. When we go to sleep, it's all gone. Everything. Are you still there? I hope so because this next part is really important. On this computer are the fragments, the clues that can help us get our memories back. Remember who you are. It's the only way you'll find the truth. She was in my dreams again. That girl. Those beasts. Five of them. You need to make it stop. Your name is Laura Green. You're 19 and you live in Mire. I am you. You had an accident a few months ago. When we go to sleep, it's all gone. Everything. Remember who you are. It's the only way to find the truth. You can do this. One. Two. Three. Four. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to Laura ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - Woo! Happy birthday, Laura! - Woo! You know me? You may not remember, but yes, we are your friends. I'm Sophie. Sophie. More like best friends. Right, Olivia? Olivia. Wait. What's your name? Carly. We're friends? You remember? I saw her on Instar. What about you? I'm Diana. Hey! We're friends. So, how do we know each other? We were friends from high school. You used to call me Lady Di. Oh, whatever, Lady Di. We've been friends since reception with Miss Tooley. I don't suppose you remember Toothless Tooley? Our mothers were friends, so we kind of grew up together. And like I said, I'm Sophie. Or "Soph", to you. The piano. Yes. That's right. What else? I don't know. It just came to me. You used to play so well. Do you remember what you used to play for me? My head's completely empty. I thought something might surface. Nevermind. You know it's like tradition, right? Today is Laura Green day. Girl, you must remember something. All those crazy parties? Come on, we had so much fun. You were the life and soul of the party, always. Still nothing? Will you stop asking me that? Look, perhaps we should slow down a bit. It's just... It's just so good to see you. We want our Laura back, that's all. We'll try to be more careful. I want it all back, too, but I'm really sorry, I can't remember who any of you are. We thought that perhaps we might have a breakthrough on your birthday. You always used to love celebrating your birthday. You did so well last time, we thought that... We've spoken like this before? When? What Olivia is trying to say is that we're all here to help you, Laura. Answer my question. Maybe let's start with what you do remember. Fine. I can remember things like how I like to wear my hair, the type of music that I like, and that I have to take these pills everyday. My favorite meal is a linguine with garlic prawns. I just, I just know that. But for the life of me, I can't remember the other stuff. Like, like you guys. That's encouraging. Well, in that case, you owe me money. A shit ton of it. But I'll settle for your Beemer. Nice try. See? I can still make you laugh. Seriously, all I've got is this stupid video of me telling me that I'm me. Do you know how fucked up that is? It's like everyday is the first day of my life and I have to get to know myself all over again. And then sometimes, I think, how do I even know if that's real? And true. Look on the bright side, though. If you have a bad day, you don't remember. Silver linings, you know? Olivia's right. There's plenty I wish I didn't remember. I have a question. Why are we meeting like this and not in person, if it's my birthday? It's what you wanted. This is the only way we could see you without, you know... - Isolation. - Making you uncomfortable. We still wanted to celebrate your birthday. Why would I want to be isolated? She means safe. You wanted to be somewhere you feel safe. That's right! Safe. - Wait, safe from what? - In your room. Nothing. Who would want to hurt you? Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right. So, this is my room. As weird as this is, I guess it would be weirder in person. And you're right, I do feel safe in here. My mother always said to trust your instincts. And it's important for you to feel safe, particularly in your condition. Do you know anything about my life? I just know that I'm single. How do you know that? That video I told you about. It tells me what I need to know each morning, like why I can't remember. The dissociative amnesia? Yeah, that's it, but how do you know? Well, we all know. That's why we're here. To try to help you regain your memories. Yeah, I don't even really know what it is. Well, when a person blocks out certain information, it's usually associated with a stressful or traumatic event, and it leaves them unable to remember important personal information. Well, that's what the doctor told us anyway. That's why you can't remember us. Yeah, I think she gets it, Carly. Trauma? You said Trauma. Did something happen to me? Maybe this is too much, too soon. I have a right to know if something happened to me. I think Olivia's right. You should let the memories come back when you're ready. I'm ready now! Remember that your mind is still trying to protect you, gently putting the pieces back together in small doses that you can cope with. Upsetting this process now may cause you to regress. Okay, well, I have pieces. I've been making notes on my computer. That's really good. Maybe you could share them with us, and if there are gaps, we can help you to fill them in. Oh, for fuck sake, just tell her! What is your problem? Tell me what? This is taking forever. Let's put it to a vote. I for one think she can handle this. I'm not sure. Do you need a moment? The Laura I know would never put up with this bullshit. Laura? I can handle it. See? I told you so. Who knows her best? We're all here to help. I'd just like you to get there by yourself. It's just so hard. Let's see your notes. Okay. Um, how do I show you? There's a thing at the bottom of your screen that says "share screen". Wow, it's such a mess. Can you give the girl a break? It's just you were always so super tidy. Perhaps it's reflective of my state of mind. Looks like you've been busy, though. That must be a good thing. Yes. Indeed. Great work, Laura. This is the start of your journey back to you. "Five clues." Hm. Do you know what they are, these five clues? No idea. All I know is that I've scribbled it on these notes like some kind of crazed maniac. You're clearly obsessed. Maybe you've already told yourself somewhere? Yes. That's right. You said you recorded a video to tell you things when you wake up. Maybe you did the same for the clues? I don't see anything. What about the Recycle Bin? Why would I delete something that's so important? Well, um, by accident? Frustration? A moment of psychosis? It could be any number of things. Why do we do anything? Who knows? But if this is an investigation, then we might as well be thorough. You have to highlight it, then click "restore". I've hidden the five clues in a file called... "Nell". Be careful. They are watching. Wait, who's "they"? Why "Nell"? That's me. But who's that with their arm around me? Is it one of you guys? No idea. Must've been taken ages ago. Do you recognize anyone? Definitely not me. Olivia, is it you? Olivia? Sorry, what? Do you recognize the arm? Are you sure? It's just... What do you see? Nothing. I don't see anything. What are you keeping from me? Nothing! I swear, I don't know anything. You're not telling me something. I can feel it. Who is the other girl in that photo? Tell me, now! She doesn't know anything, okay? Leave her alone. Laura, enough! She's here to help. Admonishing her isn't going to get you or us anywhere. As far as I'm aware, none of you are helping me. Laura, please. No, don't do that. You're all strangers to me. You show up claiming to be my friends, and you expect me to just accept it? Like this is completely normal. Just five friends hanging out. And then on top of that, you won't tell me what you actually know about my life. It's my life. Mine, and I deserve to know what you know. Otherwise, just fuck off. Laura, we know how hard this must be for you, but trust me, we all came here today to try to help you on your road to recovery. Nobody here expects you to be the same old Laura again overnight. We just hope that by reigniting some repressed memories we might stir something in you. We might even bring you back. How can you possibly know what it's like? To wake up in a body that doesn't even feel like it's yours. Like you're some kind of parasite. Oh, hun. Don't cry. You know we love you. That's the problem, Lady Di. I don't. Look, we've always been there for you. Stood by you through so much. You have to believe that. I just wish you could remember it all, so you could see who you really are. Somewhere deep down, I must know. I'm sorry, guys. That could be your way back. Trust those feelings. I have an anger. It's like a rage, deep inside of me, and it scares me. Acknowledging how you truly feel is progress. When I saw that photo, I almost couldn't hold it back. Why would I feel that way? Stop looking as Laura. Yes, put her aside for a moment. Find the truth in the person you are now. If Laura is the cause of your anger, then try to be the person who is without anger. Try to find that place inside you where there's peace. I don't know if I can. Let's try an exercise. Laura, I want you to close your eyes. Now, take a deep breath in, and let it out slowly through your mouth. That's it. Good. Okay. Now, I want you to try to tap into that anger. What is it telling you? That's it. Good. Deep breaths, in and out. Laura? There's nothing. Take a look at that picture again. What do you see? I know that tattoo. It's the symbol of the Pagan Goddess. Do you recognize it? I have one, too. We all have one. Even Olivia. Olivia, are you there? Show her. You, me and Olivia. We got them together. Tell her, Olivia. - Yeah. - What about you, Sophie? Or you, Lady Di? Just you three. I'm not really into that voodoo shit. Why us three? We are the goddesses of destiny, represented by the Spiral Goddess. Life. Death. And... Rebirth. See what I mean? Voodoo shit. Wiccan, actually. Witchcraft. Are you saying that we're witches? No. Goddesses. This really isn't important. No, this doesn't make sense. - It will, if you just let it. - But, look... My arm doesn't have a tattoo. But you said that we got them together. I think it was taken just before you got yours, maybe? That's it. So it's one of you in the picture? Sure. Yes or no? Olivia? Tell me right now! Is it you? Calm, Laura. Why can't she just tell me? Olivia, tell me right now! Olivia! What the fuck? I'm not doing this anymore. Attacking Olivia is gonna get you nowhere. This is meant to be a safe space, remember? Why are you protecting her? Carly, tell me. Who is it? She's not your enemy, Laura. She's been a good friend to you. And I am? No, this was supposed to answer my questions. It wasn't supposed to leave me with more. Seeing you like this is painful for all of us. Everyone processes their emotions differently. Trying to help you remember means she has to remember and confront her pain, too. Her pain? Shit. We need to get her back. It's important that we all do this together. No, maybe I shouldn't be doing this. I think I should just do this by myself. But together we can do so much more. Agreed. Look at what we achieved today. Achieved? You really think that we achieved something today? Well, you know more about that tattoo. No, now I have one more unsolved clue to add to a whole list of unsolved clues, which by tomorrow are just gonna be gone, anyway. If what I told myself this morning is even true. But maybe, this time we'll find out enough to have a breakthrough. Maybe tomorrow will be different. You'll wake up knowing who you are. Isn't that what you want? If only. More than anything. I'm just... I'm just so tired. Careful with those pills! They have to be taken in the correct dosage. They are the only things keeping me calm. Carly, can you get Olivia back, please? - You're not the boss of me. - I'll do it. Carly, take a break. Hey. Are you all right? I know. I know this is difficult, but you're doing so well. Yeah, I know. I know how much she meant to you and you're all doing an impressive job. That's why we need you to come back. Can you do that for me? For her? No, it's not a betrayal. No, it's not a betrayal. You're helping her. Trust me. This is working. Okay, so this is the furthest we've gotten. A little while longer and hopefully we can make the breakthrough that we all so desperately want and finally get to the bottom of what happened to her. Yeah, I realize you've put her behind you. But do it for Nell. Can I count on you? Right, are we all feeling a bit better now? I just want to reiterate that it is perfectly normal for our emotions to get the better of us in a situation like this, but, I know that together, we will help Laura find the truth. I'm sorry, Olive Branch. I shouldn't have yelled at you. You called me "Olive Branch". So? It used to be your pet name for me. And I remembered. Maybe you can remember, then? Maybe? Well, you just called Olivia, "Olive Branch". Well, some stuff comes back, but I don't know why. It means that you're slowly starting to access the part of your brain that's been cut off since the accident. I mean, can't you just try harder? These things can't just be coincidences. I am trying. Easy, Carly. It's not that simple. And what would you know about any of it, Lady Di? Enough to know that you can't force it. Well, maybe it will work in this case! It won't! Not like that. Right, Sophia? It could. I mean, she just remembered the name thing with Olivia. That was completely random. But important, nevertheless. She's a step closer to knowing. That doesn't get us closer to the goal. Goal? To help you remember. She remembers more than she did before. That's something, right? Oh, for fuck sake. Don't you get it? Well, what the fuck do you think we're doing here? Can we please stop fighting? Sophie? Okay. So... Laura's memories are like a giant puzzle of broken pieces. And how do you put a puzzle back together? Look at the picture on the box? Precisely. You match the pieces, one-by-one, until the picture's complete. It takes lots of time and lots of patience. See? You can't just force those pieces together and hope it makes up the picture. I still think there are key pieces that will help us get there faster. Are you guys the key pieces? Can you tell us what you mean by that? Well, it's like you said. I remembered something about Olivia. Something that's personal. Maybe each of you is a key to the whole picture. Maybe you guys are the clues. Okay? Well, why not? Before this morning, I didn't know who any of you are. How do I even know that you are who you say you are? I would never lie to you. Are you asking us to prove that we're your real friends? Now that sounds like the old Laura. Yes. Why not? Well, hold on. Put yourselves in her shoes. Imagine you received a call from four strangers claiming to be your best friends, on your birthday, which you don't even know that it is. Maybe you'd be a little bewildered, too. Even suspicious? Why would four people call up an amnesiac on her birthday and claim to be her friends? Maybe they want something from her. I don't want anything from her. Really, Olivia? We both know that's not true. Laura did, too. I did? What did I know? I don't want to be a part of this anymore. I need to get out. Here we go again. Piss off, Lady Di. You don't even belong here. Do you want to think about that for a second? Because we could be having this conversation elsewhere. A place that is not so comfortable. You don't have a choice in this, and you know the consequences if you don't. Consequences? Just something between Lady Di, Olive Branch and me. Okay, let's all calm down and take a deep breath. Laura doesn't even like you. For fuck sake. Are we still in high school? I don't give a fuck about being popular any more. Oh, did you hear that Laura? It's true. Come on, ladies. Let's remember why we're here. I know why I'm here. You're a sell-out. You think I sold you out? You turned your back on us and Laura, who gave you everything. And yet I'm the person you come to when you're in the shit. Doesn't change the fact that you walked away. I needed to walk away. Besides, it's what you wanted anyway, wasn't it? To have Laura all to yourself? Laura only wanted me for one thing and it wasn't friendship. What? Don't believe her. She's such a liar. Diana? I didn't see you complaining when we made you popular, rather than the pathetic outcast that you were, before Laura found you. I was never an outcast. I never thought you were an outcast, Di. You were just a loser who peddled drugs to rich kids, and that's all you ever were. Carly, stop. No, maybe this shit just needs to be said. This has nothing to do with Laura. She doesn't need to hear this. It has everything to do with Laura. She needs to know that she was betrayed! Betrayed? By Lady Di. How? For a while it was always the four of us. Until Diana ruined it. Yet you wasted no time in replacing me. You said earlier that we hadn't spoken in a while. Is that why? Sort of. It's complicated. Well, you're here now. That counts. Sure. Oh, my god. Get over yourself. But what about you, Sophie? What about me? When the others talk, I can feel the history. But when you talk, it's not quite the same. What do you hear? Well, you don't sound like a friend. And you are older than all of us. And? Laura needs to feel comfortable that all of us are who we say we are. Who are you? To me. You know me very well. You just need to remember. Maybe you should help her with that. The piano. I used to love watching your fingers dance across the keys when you played Chopin for me. Actually, I have a video. Here it is. I don't know how to put it into words. I can feel something overwhelming. It's like a flood of emotions, but I don't know where it's coming from. You have to do better, Laura. I'm trying. It's a lot. The emotions that I'm feeling... Try to see the whole picture. Where is it taking you? This is going nowhere. It's okay. I know it's frustrating. Just keep trying. You're doing so well. "You're doing so well." We're here for you. Are you? Are you really? Or are you just doing this so that you don't have to feel guilty that poor pathetic Laura can't remember shit? It's not easy for any of us to see you like this. We just want Laura back. Yeah. Maybe Laura's gone and you just need to come to grips with it. The old Laura is dead. This is the new version. Lost and fucked up. You just need to get used to it. Old or new, lost and fucked up, we're still friends. Why? Why what? Why even bother with me, with all of this? Let go and move on. Because if any of us were sitting in the same predicament, you would do the same. Thanks. At least I'm a good person. Laura was the best of them. No one could touch her. You can count on us. Do you feel you can fully commit to this now? Yes. I want to get better. You can do this. I've always had your back. Okay. Let's finish the puzzle. Who is she to you? I don't recognize her. The photo is blurred. Blurred? Maybe it's an old picture, or something? You think so? Why do you think you included this photo? I don't know. Well, it must hold some importance to you. I don't remember. Could it be like a picture of you? You know, from ages ago? No, she doesn't look familiar. Do you think that she looks like me? Laura would die before letting anyone do that to her hair. Okay, maybe we don't fixate on the picture. It's just a puzzle piece. An important one, but we need all of the others to complete the picture. They are responsible. Don't trust them. Why am I saying that? They are responsible. Responsible for what? Don't trust whom? Don't trust you? - Us? - This is crazy. We're doing this to help you. What would we be responsible for? I don't know, but I obviously thought it was important enough to warn myself about it. Do you honestly think we would hurt you? Why not? You were the ones encouraging me to delve deeper, and form a complete picture. Isn't that what you said, Sophia? Yes. Well, delving deeper means unearthing the ugly truth. What if that's the complete picture? What if my memories tell a story that you want to remain buried? But it's possible that your memories are being filled in by what isn't there or what shouldn't even be there. And it's making you paranoid. Yeah, about your friends. Or you're telling me the version of the truth that you want to me to believe. I don't have any way to verify what you're saying. I just have my feelings. And what are they saying? That I should trust them, like you said. So, we're the ones lying? Our help is a bunch of lies? Give me a fucking break. Not lies, no, but it's not the truth. I just know it's not the whole truth. Oh, you know! Well, this morning, you didn't even know your own name. Olivia. What? You freaked out when you saw that picture with the arm around me. Why? Like I said. It just brought back some painful memories. That doesn't make sense 'cause you also said that we had our tattoos done at the same time, but in that picture, my arm doesn't have one. We explained that already. Not really. Is it her arm? Look at me. Olivia, tell me! Is it your arm? Leave her alone! Stay out of this, Carly. Laura, stop! Olivia! It's my fucking arm, all right? You happy now? This way isn't going to get you answers. Shut up, Sophia. Stop trying to control this and just let the truth come out. This is some kind of conspiracy to keep the truth away from me. I heard you earlier, Sophie. I heard what you said when you called Olivia. You did? Can't we just tell her? I can't take this shit anymore. Soph, we've got to put a stop to this. It's time. We could never get a better chance. You've all been lying to me. I don't trust you. The accident. It was you. I know it was you. Tell me. Christ, Laura, calm down, please, and we'll tell you. Listen to Diana. If you calm down, we'll explain everything. Take some deep breaths like I showed you. In. One, two, three. And out. Three, two, one. That's it. You're in a safe space. Trust us, please, for your sake. Have you been lying to me all along? Not lying, but a version of the truth. A version? A more digestible one. One that can help you to find out the truth by yourself. We didn't want to risk too much too quickly. So, you lied? No, I don't trust this. I don't trust you. This call is over. Wait, Laura! Your shoulder. Pull down your shirt. What about it? Pull down your shirt and see. On your left. What is this? A wound. I was stabbed? Yes, by some kind of object. A knife? Not likely. Something blunt but with a pointed end. How? We have to take this slowly, remember. If I was stabbed, I want to know why. Who did it? I'm worried you might not be ready for this. Just tell me. How was I stabbed? I was the one that found you. It was early, the sun hadn't even come up yet. You found me? You had lost a lot of blood. You were in bad shape. Oh, my god. Then what happened? I radioed the station to call you an ambulance, and then got you to the hospital. The station? I'm with the police. I'm a Detective Constable. Do you know who stabbed me? Not yet. Right. So that's why you're here. We're not really friends, are we? - Not anymore. - Oh, my god, get over it. Christ, Carly. Really? So, there's an investigation? Yes, but... Who stabbed me, god damn it? I was hoping you could tell me. Don't you remember anything about that night? You were in your underwear when I found you. Underwear? A slip. It was a miracle I found you when I did. You're so brave. But if I was in my underwear, does that... Does that mean... You were raped. How do you know for sure? The medical exam performed at the hospital. It showed considerable signs of vaginal tearing, alongside bruising and bleeding. And that's what caused the memory loss? Sometimes to protect you, your brain just shuts itself off. It won't allow you to remember. The trauma of the attack, combined with the blood loss likely resulted in PTSD, which, yes, triggered your present state. The truth is not an easy thing to hear. That's why your mind has shut it out. It's too much for you. So that's it? There's not much to go on, unfortunately. Did you search around the area? What about a rape kit? We turned up nothing. Nobody saw anything, apart you walking aimlessly down the side of the road. But what about the rape kit? Did they do one? They did a swab. There was no DNA. So you've not done any real police work, then? You're just hoping on me? I have done everything possible to try and solve this case. You have no idea. So that's it? If I don't remember, then the person who did this to me just, they get away with it? That's why we need you to remember. I don't have a choice. That means facing the trauma of the attack that brought on your amnesia. Do you think that you can do that? Yeah. I have to. We can stop whenever you feel like it. Just tell me if it gets too much. I'm going to show you a few pictures. I have to warn you they're pretty graphic. You were most likely held down. The bruising is consistent with rope or leather straps. Same with your ankles. The skin on the inside of your ankles was rubbed raw, suggesting that your legs were held apart, whilst you were assaulted. Do these pictures bring back any recollections at all? Nothing. It's like I feel the pain from the attack, but it might as well be a stranger in those pictures. Take your time. These pictures may trigger something. On the other hand, it's not unusual for patients to have total recall and everything comes rushing back altogether. Let's hope so. Because when I go to bed tonight, this is all history. My head feels like it's gonna explode. I... I need a minute. Of course. What's so funny? Sophie. Sophia. I've spent so long trying to remember something, trying to remember anything... Who the fuck are you, Sophie? Or Sophia. Whatever your name is. You're not really my friend, are you? I'm a psychiatrist. My psychiatrist? Yes. Yeah, well, I don't need a psychiatrist. Only crazy people need psychiatrists. Sure! Apart from the amnesia and delusion. Dr. Carlton's been treating you for a while now. You can trust her. She only wants what's best for you. Yeah, well, how can I trust any of you when you're constantly lying to me? Those are valid feelings. I haven't lied to you. Not in the way that you think. I just haven't given you the whole truth. It's a new treatment I've been experimenting with, and I truly think it's the key to you finding out who you really are. Right, okay. So, I'm a guinea pig, then? Yeah, that's great. You only have to look at how far you've come to realize that these unusual tactics are working. Can you deny that you're closer to finding out the truth of who you are and what happened to you on the night of the attack? Maybe. You've buried the truth long enough now. Under so many layers, you can't distinguish what's real and what's not. Friend from stranger. Or friend from enemies. Enemies? Yeah, I'm just not sure of anything anymore. I believe that you are ready to face the truth. Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing this. You have no idea the strength that lies within you. I've seen it first-hand. Just one more clue could get you there. Tell me what you see. A house. Is there anything familiar? No. Are you sure? Focus your energy. Trust your instincts. I want you to take another look and tell me what you see. Are you listening to me? Yes, Sophia. Dr. Carlton. What do you see? A house. And how does it make you feel? Happy? Maybe? Happy? Why happy? A girl, maybe. Yeah. She's, she's playing outside. No, wait. She's on a swing. She's happy. Swinging back and forth. Okay, focus on that feeling. That contented feeling. So free. That's good. Stay with that feeling. Something's wrong. Something doesn't feel right. It's okay. Stay with it. No. No! It's all right. You're safe. Help me! It's all right. You're okay. He's coming. Who's coming? He's almost here. It's all right. Keep calm. Tell us what you see. He, he is here. He wants me. Okay, describe him for me. Darkness, where his face should be. Red eyes. Like the devil. It's okay. Stay calm. The five-pointed star. And I'm in the middle. The five. They're watching. Nell! It's okay. Nell, it's Dr. Carlton. Nell Prentiss. It's Sophia. Listen for my voice. Come back. Why are you showing me this? Do you remember those sessions? Remember? I've done everything that I could to forget. Forget what? That life. Her. But you recovered. Do you really think it's the kind of thing that someone can recover from? But you keep telling yourself that. Or better yet, why don't you write another book about it? I see the hostility is back again. I had things right where I wanted them, and then you had to come along and just ruin it. By masquerading as Laura Green? That is not who you are. Masquerading? I'm not masquerading as anyone. I am Laura and she is me. You aren't Laura and you could never be her. Please, just tell us where she is, and then we don't have to do this anymore. She's right here, Olive Branch. Safe and sound. Don't call me that. You are not Laura Green. You are Nell Prentiss. Do you remember Nell? Nell is gone. You're that little girl from your nightmares. We all have nightmares. Even you, Dr. Carlton. I still see that little girl, right here in front of me. The girl who came to me, terrified, unable to speak, who had been through so much. Nell... You've gotten through all of this before, and put it into your past. I know you can do it again. You just have to trust me. The person you're trying to remember, Laura Green, isn't actually you. I know what you're trying to do and I'm not gonna fall for it this time. I am safe, right here. I know it doesn't seem like it, but Dr. Carlton is trying to help you. More lies! At least we're not pretending to be someone that we're not. Leave me alone, all of you. Don't you think this has gone on for long enough? Laura. Use her real fucking name. Nell. We need to figure out what happened to Laura the night of the attack. I am the one who was stabbed and raped. I am Laura! The hell you are! Carly, just let me do this. Oh, for fuck sake. I am so done with this. Carly! What? Let's start at the beginning. That house. The one on Delaney. You find that familiar, right? Vaguely. That house used to belong to the Prentiss family, Arthur, Mary and their little girl, Nell. It had a bad reputation in the village for years. Evil, some say. Neighbors often complained about pets disappearing or weird chanting in the middle of the night. Voodoo shit. One night, police were called out to reports of a girl screaming, and what they discovered was one of the worst crimes to have ever have occurred in Mire, or in the county, for that matter. A 12-year-old girl was discovered tied down to the floor at the center of a pentagram. Around her lay five bodies, purported members of a small pagan cult, all dead. And the craziest bit, though, was the coroner's report. They couldn't find a cause of death. Their lives had been kind of sucked out of them. Consumed. The little girl that they found was you, Nell. You were the victim of systematic rape in regular pagan sex ceremonies. You killed them all. There was no proof of that. Given the way she was found, she wasn't even considered to be a suspect. Everyone knows it was her! What she is. That was seven years ago. For six years, I treated her. We made enough progress that she could return into society to live a normal life. You were 18 when you moved back to the village. At first you kept very much to yourself. You got a job on my grandparents' farm. It was just the two of us. And... Then I introduced you to Laura. And that was it. You became obsessed. You started stalking her online and in real life. But you didn't stop there. You copied her hair and makeup, the way she dressed. You even began to talk like her. So pathetic. Laura loved it. I tried telling her you were bad news. At first Laura couldn't get enough of her very own obsessed stalker. But later, it was your past that really interested her. You were different. Special. To think that you could be her. It happened the night of your 19th birthday. Laura planned a surprise party for you. We were gonna get drunk, just us girls. Where was this party? The house on Delaney. Delaney? That house? Where Nell grew up? Oh, it was just a joke. I told Laura it was a bad idea. A fucked up one. Oh, whatever. Laura brought your favorite. Tequila. And we took shot after shot, and you got pretty wasted. Tried to get you to stop, but, you insisted on having a good time. Be like Laura. But then you started to cry. Maybe it was that house? I tried to console you. When you finally stopped, you got angry. You said that we hated you and that we were lying to you, that we weren't really your friends. Sound familiar? You said you didn't need anybody. Then you went after Laura, pushing her, accusing her of ruining your life. - Suddenly there was a knife. - A weird witch dagger. Freaked us the fuck out. You started pointing it at us, at Laura. You were crazy with rage. And then it happened. There was a fight. That's how you ended up getting stabbed. Laura was defending herself. We panicked and ran. - "We"? - Me and Olivia. - We thought she killed you. - But you killed her! Carly, there is no evidence of that. Nell, are you still there? Nell, it's okay. You're safe. I can't get it out of my head. Blood... Blood everywhere. So much blood. Make it stop. Please, just make... Make it stop. I don't know whether they are my memories or not. I can't take it anymore. Let me out. I am Laura Green. I am Laura Green. No more. No more. No more! We're marked forever, you and I. Look, I know how hard this must be for you, Nell. To realize the person you're trying to remember so badly is a manufactured persona based on someone else entirely. Someone you would rather be than the person that you truly are. But sooner or later, we all have to face up to the truth of who we really are, no matter how badly we want to forget. You have no idea what you are talking about. Okay, so... To you, Laura is as real as your mind can make her. You've convinced yourself that Nell doesn't exist and you've replaced her with a version that's more appealing to you and the world around you. What is identity, I guess, but a supposition of social imprints that we aspire to which may or may not align with any of us? I want you to take a look at the picture of the young girl again. Is it still obscured to you? You know it's not. Who do you see? A girl. And who is she? Who the fuck do you think? Me. Nell, the mind sees what it wants to see. You couldn't see the picture because you didn't want to and that's why it appeared blurred. Just take a look around you now. What do you see? My room. And where is that room, do you think? Home. Nell? You have no home. That room is in the secure wing of Arclight Psychiatric Hospital. You've been there for months. This is the only real home that I've ever known. Nell, the laptop. The clues. It was you. A breadcrumb trail to help you find your way back. But I didn't want to. You wanted me to. That's not true. Subconsciously, you did. You kept searching for the truth. Nell was always going to come out. You don't fucking get it, do you? That still leaves the question of what happened to Laura. Nell. Nell, you have to try. Search deep down. Tell yourself that you want to see. Separate Nell from Laura. Impossible. And yet she kept surfacing, didn't she? In the clues, in the messages. You kept searching for the truth, each and every morning. She exists on some level, even if you choose not to see it. Please, just tell them, Nell, for me. I know exactly where she exists. Bring her back! If you want to be cleared of being a suspect in Laura Green's disappearance, then you have to tell me everything you know. Everything. I remember the hall. It was so vast, it made me feel small and insignificant. Like it was the whole wide world and there I was, on that stool, in front of that piano. You told me that I could be anyone that I wanted in there. That I was safe. Safe from them. Do you remember that, Sophia? I do. And for a while, I was. Everything felt good. When I played, it all disappeared. I became a new person. And it was like on those keys and in those notes, the monsters just, they went away. And then you made me leave. And I had to go back to it all. The ugliness of society. The people. They came back. And in the middle of the night, when I was alone, he came back for me and took what he wanted. I couldn't hide anymore. I tried my best to fit in. Pretend like nothing had happened. Like they didn't come back every single night and reenact that ceremony. And then she appeared, like an angel. Laura? She was everything that I wasn't. Beautiful. Confident. Loved by everyone. And she wanted to be friends with me. Not like the other people in the town who crossed streets to avoid me. The kids who called me "witch girl" and treated me like an outcast. She saw what no one else saw. And it felt really good to be loved. Laura never loved you. I loved you. You felt threatened by me! Still delusional, are we? But I realized it wasn't me that Laura wanted. - No. - Oh, God. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. And what could she possibly want from you? She wanted to be me, more than I wanted to be her. Please. She craved power! Anything that would give her more of it over other people. And she knew all about my past. The house on Delaney. The rituals. Did she make you get that tattoo? Olivia, do you really think that she didn't know about your secret? That you were into girls and not boys? She used that. Laura was just misunderstood. "Misunderstood." Is that what you really believe? I know you hate me and that this intervention is some kind of sadistic thrill for you, but you? You and Laura weren't so different. She just knew how to channel the hatred for everyone better than you. But she used you, too. She would use everyone to get what she wanted. But not anymore. That doesn't change the fact that she's missing. No matter how much she used people. You killed her. Admit it. Just tell us. What really happened that night, Nell? It was my birthday. And I was so excited. I'd never had a birthday party before. Laura said that she was gonna surprise me. Olivia and Carly as well. And I finally thought, this is it. I'm in. And then when they took the blindfold off, I saw that Carly had her phone out and she was filming me. I should've known that something wasn't right from the very start. Wait, there's a video? Carly? There was, but I lost my phone that night. Why would I lie? To cover your arse? I told you, it's gone. No, it's not. I went back and got it. Olivia, what the actual fuck? Why didn't you tell me? I'm so sick of this. You, Laura. All you cared about is yourselves! I am tired of always doing what you two want. I did it without question. I'm so sorry for everything. For what we did to you. I'm so ashamed. Olivia, I will need to take that phone as evidence. Sure, but not until I've shown you what's on it. Olivia, don't do this. You know what this means. I have to. I hate this house. It gives me the creeps. This is Laura's big gig. Why don't we just leave? Stop being such a scaredy-cat! Here she is! The birthday girl. Surprise! Happy birthday. We're having a party here? Oh, it's gonna be so great! Aren't you excited? It's like a homecoming for you, isn't it? Yeah. Bet you've missed it. Not really. I don't like this. We shouldn't be here. Hey. That was in the past. Here's to your bright future. Hm? I don't drink. Well, it's your birthday. You have to. We all do. It's like tradition. Isn't it, Olivia? Yeah, whatever. Olivia, take this. Carls, put the camera down and get your arse over here. Give me a minute. I'm just gonna post this to Instar. Oh. Laura, please don't do this. Olivia, get down here and make sure she doesn't get free. I can't. Oh, shut the fuck up and do as you're told! Or else. I'm so sorry. Spirits of the ether. I summon you through this fertility rite. Take hold via the chalice of this young virgin and come forth. Please, stop. You don't know what you're doing. Oh, shut her the hell up! Let me feel the power of your dark magic. You aren't seriously gonna put that inside her? Oh, yeah. Do it. She's had much worse than this before. Haven't you, Nell? - Stick it to her. - Jesus. I think I can feel it. You're gonna make me a true goddess, you pathetic little whore. Laura! Laura! Stay away, you psycho bitch! Holy fuck. You raped her. We didn't rape anyone. Laura did. I wanted to stop her. A court will see it differently. How? For holding a fucking camera? You know how Laura could be. She always got her way. She made you accessories. You could've stopped it! But from the looks of it, you were enjoying it. No, no. I hated every second of it. You sick fucks. I always knew there was a dark side to Laura, but this? What about Laura? Arrest her for murder! Laura is right here. I don't see her. Oh, she's here. With me. What the fuck does that even mean? I knew I was right. Nell, you must let Laura go. Let her go? Never. We are one now. Together forever. I need her! You can't take her away! Nell. You don't need to do this. Laura is evil. Dr. Carlton is right, let her go. And let her get away with it? No, no, no, no. No! Listen to Olivia. Choose to be Nell when you go to bed tonight. And hopefully tomorrow you won't have to try to find her again in the morning. She needs to suffer. Just like I did. Look at how far you've come. Don't let it end like this. Nell, for god sake, choose yourself. You are so worthy. Nell. Don't do this. Don't go back. I'm sorry, Sophia, but it's not up to you. Nell! No more breadcrumbs, Dr. Carlton. Nice try, Laura. Where am I? Oh, my god. I'm trapped. Okay, okay. You can do this. You can do this. Right, whatever you do, you have to promise to stay calm. And please, please don't shut me off. Okay? Your name is Laura Green. You're 19 and you live in Mire, a small village in Somerset. You're single and you sell antiques. We are the same person. I am you. Others will try to tell you differently. That you're somebody else entirely. Don't trust them. This is who you are. This is where you're safe. This where you belong.
