[rock music playing] [Aliah] What we see is sometimes never is. A mind is a wondrous thing. And if you're guessing you'll probably say this was California, and from the distance it could well be. But the world I come from, this world, is far from California. This is Southern Siberia. The former Soviet Union. Rich in oil, but also the deserts of Asia. Your freedom in this place, is the ultimate bargaining chip for those who own it. Remaining alive, that's a tax paid on a daily basis. It's a tax that keeps rising. Like a shadow, this tax, it never leaves your sight. The iron heel you're born under, is the heel by which you die. [metal crunching] [siren blaring] [soft oriental music playing] Mr. Lou. As we've agreed, I'll be forwarding the diamonds to Boris. After that we pass the package on to Amoto san. I've arranged to ship it by boat. In three day it will be in Hong Kong. Your guys are the best lapidaries in the world. Tony, our guys are the best lapidaries, and your guys are the best buyers in America. I hope you've got everything organized already. Brother, you know my guys. You know you can count on them. This is not their first time. [Aliah] The only person worth trusting was the most dangerous. And even he was at behest of the wolves he employed. The one thing you learn as quick as taking your first breath, is that nothing is ever what it seems. The flash, the glitzs, the stars only shine for those who chose not to see beyond them. [cellphone ringing] [phone ringing] Mussa? I've been expecting your call. Did something unusual happen? No. Nothing unusual. No. I'm studying the stars. [bass drum sounding] You know, one of the most brilliant of them all. This one here. My Eastern star. [dramatic music playing] I don't have it. And how can you be so sure I have this Star of East? So, what's the juice? Because of our relationship, I'm willing to sell you the Star of East for half price. Thirty million US. Thirty million fucking dollars from me? What do you want from me? You want cash? Then make the fucking deal. [thunder rumbling] [rock music playing] Good evening. You again. Have you seen this girl? Stop there. I want you to write down what I tell you. Don't worry. I'll remember it. Indulge me. I want you to write it down, and keep it in your pocket, asshole. Uh, let me explain. When she worked here I was planning to come in and propose, but she disappeared unexpectedly. Has she been around since then? No. No! No! Now, listen. I'm gonna write this down for you. She's never been back here. Get it. She walked out the door, and we haven't seen her since. Is that clear? You've been coming into my place for two years. You're so fixated, you ask the same question time after time even though we keep saying, "We haven't seen the bitch". Get out of here! Sorry. Thanks a lot. [Aliah] Ruslan was not the brightest star in the room. But he never gave up... On me, that is. Neither did Arman. My two sidekicks. [upbeat music playing] My two lovers. My one dilemma. [mysterious music playing] Baby, just come see me. Just come by. I've a nice surprise. You're nicer than usual. What's the occasion? [grunts] Are you the surprise? I'm talking to my daughter. How long have you been answering to the name "sweetheart"? -I wouldn't have thought-- -You listen, lady. When I want your opinion... I'll ask for it. So Mike promised to bring the stone today. Okay. It's my Star... of the East. Where'd you plan to meet? It will be at the factory, as usual. I put the boys there. There'll be no trouble. We'll be there in three hours. You're not going. What do you mean? She is. Why? It's my... decision. Look at his face. See I was right. He's happy. Have you lost your mind? You forget who took you under his wing... after your father died? Who fed you... all these years? I remember. But I seemed to be hungry no matter how much I ate... in your place, Mussa. In my place? I remember. You had the look of a wolf cub two years ago... when I punished your little girlfriend, Aliah. [crying] You owe me. Hmm. They're all $10,000 bills. I didn't know they made them. Yes, they're rare... not available unless required... by those who can afford. So, my repeat is for the last time, Mike is bringing Mr. Lou's diamond to the abandoned factory. You'll have a security team, and Catastroff will lead the way. Catastroff. Catastroff. [Mussa whistles] Huh? So where are you going? With her. And who will you meet? I said, who will you meet? Mr. Lou. Why the fuck is he talking about Mr. Lou? You're meeting Mike at the factory. Try to focus on this. I'm giving you 30 million bucks, let's not fuck this up. I got it. I'm not a fool. [rock music playing] -Catastroff. -Huh? Oh. Right. Antonio, time to work. I was told you took this job because you are looking for your girlfriend. Good luck. You won't find her here. How did you loose your girl friend? Believe me. It won't happen second time. You sure? Good luck to you. Mr. Mike loves blondes. Just go. [clearing throat] So, you want me to make a deal with you? Khazar, let's forget the past. It's only business. You want me to take you seriously as a businessman? Now, you know there's something in it for me. What's in it for you? I get to pick up Aliah. Then I'm gone. All this for a girl? Big mistake. Just stay focused on revenge for your fathers death. [Aliah] Arman's lust to avenge the death of his father was eclipsed by his love for me. In a hopeless world sometimes the smallest light, shines the brightest. Antonio. Open the door for the lady. [cocking guns] [Aliah] The Siberian definition of a blood diamond is where 30 souls suicide themselves in 30 seconds for it. A steep price to pay, but in this part of the world, it's an even trade. Last time, Mussa sent Arman. This time I guess we got a... [chuckles] very, very beautiful young lady. -[chuckles] -Yeah. I like your sense of humor, Mr. Mike. I just hope you brought the money we all agreed on... -right? -[laughs] I may be beautiful, but I'm all business. Now, then... the diamond. Hey, bitch, let's see the money. [dramatic music playing] I hope it's, uh, 30 million exactly. Right? Oh, gentlemen. After all this time you still don't trust us? It's 30 million. And how do I know that the stone is real? Let me see it. Is this your first transaction? Nothing we do is fake. This is real! Look at it! You see, when you're dealing with us, everything you see is real. Hmm. [Aliah] When laughing hyenas come out to play, all bets are off. Our particular breed of hyena, eat their own kind. What you call "a massacre", we call it "fun day at the zoo". [grunting] [laughing] He wants to blow you. Hey, baldie. Wanna give me a blow job? Is that it? Suck this! [all laughing] The best business is always clean business. Ready? [glass shattering] [crows cawing] [gun firing] [heavy metal music playing] This is serious shit. [screaming] [guns firing] [screaming] [screaming] [gun firing] [groaning] This is serious shit. [gun shot] In your place, Mussa. [gun fires] [clicking] You whore, get what you came for? [groaning] Mussa's gonna love the way you look with a bullet in your head. [gasps] Now, Mussa will have to update your portrait. [digital beeping] [Aliah] When the devil collects, he sends your friend or your relative. A chilling reminder not to be late on the rent. But not to Mussa. Blood made no impression. In fact no one could discern what he was thinking. And here nothing was ever what it seemed. Nothing was what it seemed. But, uh, boss, I had no idea what was going down. [violin music playing] Hey, boss, there's a guy from Khazar here. Baby. Oh, I'd figured it was Khazars guys who'd grab the briefcase. Realized whose money it was, and then sent this fool to give it back. Am I right? Hey. So where's the stone, pal? You got it in your mouth? Is that why you can't talk? [laughing] Khazar send me to find out what's going on with the territorial lines? You violated the divisions. It's his conditions that don't suit me. You know, what's mine is mine. It's my territory. No one comes in here and changes the rules. Okay? Fine then. Forget it. They're just made-up borders. Well, the ways of god... are inscrutable. -I remember-- -Boss, it was luck. Somebody had to tell you who stole the goods. Please. I was watching your back for you. Focus on this. [Aliah] When the Soviet Union crashed in '91, Mussa was a General. So, when the rich were running from the wreckage outbidding each other to police, the rest of mother Russia, Mussa split with his own private army. You better watch your tongue, boy. Guess you're gonna need it. I'm not your damn boy. -[gun fires] -[screams] -You son of a bitch. -What the fuck! He shot me! You're killing the music. You're killing the music. -[groaning] -Why did you do that? Have you ever used a gun before? You stupid moron. -Boss... -You stupid? He is fucking errand boy for Khazar. -I'm sorry, it was an accident. -You stupid, son of a bitch! Why do you give me these problems? It's always the same shit with you. I'll cut your nuts, you bastard! Shut the fuck up, all right, and go home. I'll deal with my people myself. How the hell am I supposed to get home! Hey. Your men shot me! Don't make me regret he didn't kill you, okay? -He only wounded you. -[grunting] And why the fuck didn't you kill him? Why you wound him like that? -I wasn't trying. -You change your mind? You confuse the shit out of me. -I should've killed him? -One day you say you wanna kill people, next day you wanna save people. Next day you wanna... [Aliah] The prestige of every magic trick is to have your audience look one way, while the trick within the trick happens exactly where they're not looking. The art of distraction, mis-direction. This clown in the paisley shirt was the distraction. The fear you see in his eyes was never real. None of it was. And Mussa never... [water splattering] Is there anything as interesting out here as what you saw in the shower? [gasps] Don't do this. You better stop kidding yourself right now. Why you push me away? Who the hell do you think you are? [cocks gun] Wow. Brilliant. You learn quick. You don't think I know where you're going with this? All that money, it's already in your car. You got a problem with that? We got a chance to split and get the hell out of here. No way. Now, don't tell me "no way". You're in a world of precision. The end game. And you pissed away your target for panic attack? You screw it up, you let a major mark walk away, and the whole morning I'm looking for you. Where the hell were you? [mysterious music playing] How'd you find me? I can't explain now, I'm leaving, but I'll come back for you. [cocks gun] [upbeat rock music playing] You don't remember anything? Don't worry, you will. It'll come to you. Okay, you want me to leave you. I'll go, but understand we can never come back. Thanks for helping me with everything. I'll be back very soon. For helping you with everything, huh? -[gasps] -Hey. [grunts] Hmm. [panting] Put these on. [upbeat rock music playing] I sent you a message. You brain dead? What the hell happened to the girl? I don't know. She jumped in your car and split. She left in a hurry. Didn't even say anything. ♪ [Aliah] The end justifies the means. I did what I had to do. We had a raging pack of wolves clawing and itching their way after us now. And we didn't care. All we had was the two of us, and that's all you need sometimes. [snorting] [cracking] You lost my money, the diamond, and the girl. And now... you've lost something that belonged to you. [crashing] [screaming] [Aliah] The most deadly trader Siberia has ever known, the mighty Khazar. He was medicated, he was schizophrenic, and his army was loyal to narcotics. The worst jet fuel known to man. [screaming] You said you had everything under control. You have one day to get me that case on this table. And the girl lying next to it. She'll never bow down to you. Do you think I give a fuck about that girl? Gather everyone. Say? You heard me, make the call. [grunts] Don't you bullshit on me. You want a war? [flute music playing] [panting] Are you sure that Batro can be trusted. Batro is my father's best friend. Believe me. The man would never betray us. -[grunting] -And if he should ask what's going on? [groans] If we keep quiet, he won't be nosy. [wind blowing] [sniffs] I'll find you, no matter where you run. Just like a wolf... I'll sniff you out. For a wolf a hundred miles is nothing at all. Even a thousand. I'll catch up to you. Let's move. [engine revving] [grunts] Brother? Aren't you coming? [engine revving] I'll catch up to you. [piano music playing] [Aliah] Some would say David had more of a chance to beat Goliath than the two of us had to live for a day. We took our chance and ran.

When are you gonna tell me, Ruslan? It's your palace. I've always wanted one of those. Hey, who's that? Well, there's always soldiers at a queens palace. So, I guess if I'm the queen, then all the rest are my subjects? That's right. Every one? Everyone of them. The world bows at the feet of the queen. Come sit next to me. Queen shouldn't be alone, they should have their own prince. You could be my prince and the whole world will have to follow our orders. Being alone is no fun. How does the prince get chosen? The way it works is, the queen has to give the chosen one her heart. How do you do that? Oh, hold on a minute. Here. Feels kind of heavy. Hold it tight. It's yours now. -Got it! -Stop it! [children laughing] Leave him alone. That's not yours. Arman stop! [Aliah] Maybe I do have a heart of stone. And that's why my life is like this. My Queen. Joyous is the fortunate soul favored by her love. Hmm? Will you forgive me? I tried so hard to find you. I searched so long. Now... there's something I need to tell you. Sweetheart. [suspenseful music playing] It is me who has to tell you a lot. Tell me everything. Two years ago... I worked in a casino for a very rich man. Then one day when I was working at the card table, everything started to go wrong from the very first deal. One of the customers started winning big. First he doubled up, and by the 10th round, he had tripled up. Usually in those kinds of situation security will do something. They'll move the guest to a different table, or change the dealer. It's a standard response to those situations. But not in this case. After an hour, he took his winnings, quietly stood up, and left the casino through the main entrance. He walked away with half a million dollars... along with my life. [tense music playing] [laughing] [digital beeps] Catastroff. What do you think? Mm. It's excellent. Who was the man? Baha. Baha? -Yes. -No. Baha... The Slick. As you wish boss. And what happened to you? Arman? That's why you're slick, Baha. The Slick. And who are you, Arman The Slack? [playing the piano] ♪ It's nice music, isn't it? ♪ Do you know why I play? I'm just getting old. When I was your age, I was just like you. I made so many mistakes, I went into debt. I gave away the very rights to my life to others. For what? A mountain of debt. ♪ And now I thought of revealing myself through my muse. I speak of you. Why'd you loose this money in the casino tonight? It's my casino. It's my table. It's my money. Why? The croupier is not liable. Aliah, in any casino, every casino, everyone is... [Aliah] He owned everyone, including me. And all he wanted was me, just for himself. Welcome to the world run by warlords. To him, a man of endless power, I was the one star he could never buy. Aliah. How do we resolve this? Hmm? 'Cause I have to get paid. I have to get paid. Is there something else? [dramatic music playing] Will you compensate me, Aliah, so you can get through this? What can I do? I don't know, give me something. [sniffs] Give me your youth. Your beauty. Your eyes. I want your eyes. So what do you say? Aliah, you're mine? 'Cause I'll give you this. I'll give you all of it. I'll make you master of it. -[laughs] -[Aliah] No. No. It's not as if you have a choice. Aliah... You gave away the rights to your life to someone else. You've a debt, and I've got to get paid. You owe, you owe me! And by the way, you can't hide... [whimpering] 'cause I'll find you. [crying] I'll find you here. I'll find you there. I'll give you two days. Aww. [clicking of tongue] Make it three. [crying] [cellphone ringing] [Aliah] Arman made me a proposition. I was desperate for anything. I could see you were trying to call. But it was impossible for me to answer the phone. [cellphone ringing] [busy tone] [Aliah] From that moment my life had ended. I thought to slash my wrist. But Arman took away even that option. [gasps] He told me my life was no longer my own. From that point on I shut down. [horn tooting] There was no room for love in my new life. [breathing heavily] [man] We're clearing Sector 3, proceeding to Sector 4. [Aliah] Arman brought me to Khazar. Mussa conducted his dirty business. But the dirtiest business in this city was conducted by Khazar. Drugs, and murder for hire... He was the only one who could deal with Mussa. This was the residue of the Cold War. She's here. I was told... you'd sleep around, but you don't want to. You may need a job, but you, you... are of no use to me now. It's like fire. A lighter or match can light either a pipe or a cigar, both ways work. However the true nature of the problem is... one is natural... and one is not. Matches are just better. Just like I'm better than Mussa. Why bring her? So, what can I do? The truth is... these are really games for men. [Arman] She's a lot tougher than she looks. A shooter who's an expert. Here's your chance. Prove it. [digital beeping] Come now. I got it. [gun firing] [footsteps approaching] [Aliah] They called him Cube. He could do anything. He began training me for work. At least that's what he called it. I wanted to throw myself under a bullet... rather than being an assassin. To take away the lives of the innocent, but Cube kept me to the program. I didn't ask any more questions. [panting] [Cube] Stop. [breathing heavily] [grunting] I saw how you were looking at Veera when she fell. I presume you felt sorry for her. You shouldn't. She won't for you. I don't want to do things I shouldn't. I left the man who loved me, and wanted nothing in return. I'm getting ready to kill people. for that son of a bitch. And I'm doing it so I can give money to another son of a bitch. The truth is those sons of bitches live on a different planet. It should be one world for all. It's not your decision to make. Who does? Me. I'm in charge. Everyone's exploited. At least with Khazar you know where he's coming from. So that makes it right? The only thing you need to do is pull the trigger. You have nothing to fear. Do it quickly, and don't loose your concentration. And refrain from asking too many questions. And I didn't ask any more questions. But at first it was hard. Let's keep this concise. On my command. Got it? It's critical [laughing] [cocks gun] [Cube] Thirty seconds. [Aliah] I never dreamed one day I'd be recruited... as a hammer. All warlords here are in the crosshairs. And to get out of hell... my new job as just to crush. [gun fires] [grunts] [somber music playing] It seemed like it wasn't real. [upbeat rock music playing] [grunts] [Aliah] I wanted to be the best. I wanted to be Mussa... if only for a moment. [gun firing] [bullets clanking] That rendezvous... at the abandoned factory, that's the first time I failed to carry out an assignment. Say something. Talk to me. I'm sick. Ruslan... [Ruslan] Do you want to stand in front? [Aliah] No! It will exactly be like in that movie. [laughs] -Just go. -You really mean that? As you wish, my Queen. Right now, I'm not willing to come down to earth. It's clear enough. There's no need to talk about it. Please let me explain to you. -[Ruslan] I love you! -[laughing] [laughs] Oh! I love you so much. Oh! Come here. I'm so happy. Would you leave me alone? Please give me a chance. This money will help us survive. Thanks, but I don't want anything from you. You should take the money and leave. No. [crying] You know this money will help start a new life. We'll be able to leave. Oh, really? For where? Wherever we want. We'll just leave. We'll settle some place. We'll start a family. You'll be a great father, I'm sure of it. How many kids would you like? Three? Four? How 'bout six? Stop it, Aliah. Where were you for two years? How come you never tried to call? I'm sorry. I told you everything I did. Really? You've confessed to everything? And nothing! Has he been screwing you these two years? Please. Give me a chance. [grunts] I love you, sweetheart! Aliah! Whooo!

Hope you like them. It cost a lot. [both] Forgive me. [Aliah gasps & laughs] [flute music playing] You know what's weird? When I'm with you I feel like everything will work out.

Fly away. Drive away. Or sail away. Sailing away is possible. An old fried of mine gave me that picture. Buksir? You remember? You were only a little boy when we took that trip many years ago. He's a former customs officer. Retired. Yes. He lives in a little place. Where else could he live, but by the edge of sea. After all those years guarding the border, he feels there should be a border for goods, but not for people. He lives pretty much the way he wants. I wrote his number down. I'll tell him you'll call. He'll get us a boat? You have no other way out. There's always a way out. [phone ringing] Yes, Mr. Lou. Mussa. Look out your window. You see anything? No. That means I'm still waiting for an answer to my question. I don't need to repeat myself. Do I? No. You'll have your answer in the morning. -[digital beeps] -[busy tone] [dramatic music playing] [laughing] Her husband walks in just when I'm about to come. Bad luck. Everyone stay awake, I got to go take a piss. [sniffs] [grunts] Like a race horse. [Arman] You can stop right there. Put the briefcase down. Now, step back. I've brought everything as we agreed. What's this bullshit? Hey, screw off. Get out of here. [yelling in foreign language] You really brought it? I'm confused. Why the hell did she pick you? We have an agreement. I return the money, and then you let us both go. In a minute no one's gonna remember... what the agreement was. [dramatic music playing] No need for the guns. We got this. Grandpa's about to have a world of hurting. We had an arrangement. [grunting] I promised Mussa... [grunting] I promised Khazar... [grunting] [clicking] Sue me. And my boys are gonna take care of you. [grunting] -[clicking] -Oh, shit! [grunting] [grunting] Come on, let's go. Hey, Sorrow. -[grunting] -Get in here. We're coming. We're coming. Don't turn around. Put the weapon down. You should've kept your word. Take the case and get out of here. Go on, Red, help him. He wiped out everybody. Drop the gun. [grunts] Which one do I put it in? What do you mean? I mean, which car? There's ours and the one the bald guy came in. Do I have to draw you a map? If you hadn't asked me, which car would you guessed, cousin? [scoffs] [gasps] You know the end... it's who's still standing that counts. Friends are nothing. It's about money, weapons and power. You're forgetting something. No, you're forgetting something. Anyone can be bought if you know the price. [kids laughing] So, tell me... what did you have to come up with to conquer the heart of stone? How much? Arman, you can't buy love with money. Hey, Sorrow. Who beat the shit out of you? [grunts] [grunts] What the fuck! What the fuck! What the fuck! What the hell happened here? If I leave you guys for five seconds everything falls apart? Son of a bitch! [screams] Son of a bitch! Who the fuck did this? Now, what am I supposed to tell Arman? [grunting] [gasping] Who did this? Who? Sl... Slick.

It's in the trunk. [chuckles] Hello, boss. Baha. [laughing] [snaps] Come on, let's pull over now. We're not in a big hurry now. You're feeling better? Yeah, I'm good. Are you hungry at all? We need to get far away from these guys. Come on, you have to admit, that's a pretty smart idea. Yeah, I guess. [grunts] I'm gonna split you open, baby. I'm gonna split you open wide. Wide. You fuck with me? Always a heart of stone. What about that place? You wanna stop there? What is it, boss? What? What's the matter? Boss? Where the fuck is it? Where the fuck is it? Where is it? -I'll cut you into pieces, you fucking piece of shit. -[crying] Where the fuck is it? -[screaming] -You dumb... What you fuck? What you fuck? What you fuck? What you fuck? [screaming] You piece of shit! You piece of shit! You piece of shit! Where is it? Fuck you! [screaming] [indistinct screaming] I want a fucking reason. I want a fucking reason. Get away from me. [screaming] Shut up! So, why'd you do that? I thought you were going to give it back, so I got up and switched them. You kept sleeping. I'm going to buy some snacks. Call Buksir. Everything's going to be all right. [cellphone buzzing] Well, just the right time to talk business. -Yeah. -[Mussa] Yeah? Yeah? Is that a "yeah"? [laughing] At least I got a "Yeah". That's a step in the right direction. Haven't even told you why I have called. [laughing] I'm liking this. How about a "Yeah" to where my money is? Well, you got one guess. Only one?[laughing] Fucking magnanimous of you, nephew. I get one guess, you stingy little bastard. Could it be... could it be the little girl? The little catch of a girl you introduced to Khazar? Stupid move, Arman. You never gave her a choice. She would have wound up there anyway. Not necessarily, you know. She could have stripped down and gotten into bed. We would've all been closer. Your idea of close, it's not really an option. Well, this case is the worst but... [laughs] Fuck it. Whatever. So what's it like on the run? What do you think? You set this in motion. You cut all of us loose. Why? You gonna be working with Khazar now? I'm just trying not to get pissed on. What do you say we amend the situation? Well, as always, you know best. Well, why don't we shake hands on it, at least, huh? Kiss and makeup? All right. Which hands you have there for me? The left. Why? Because I want to reach out to your imagination. You know how I picture things in my mind before I put 'em on canvas. I want you to know that I have the feels, the sensibility for your sense of touch. [chuckles] Okay, I feel it. I feel it deeply. We'll be in touch. I'll bring the money to you. By the way, Khazar was generous enough to invite me to dinner tonight, you know. That was nice. In fact, he's on speaker phone right now. He wants to commission me to do a portrait. I said to him, "It's a brilliant idea." It's brilliant because it speaks of a resolution. But... he insists on falling upside down. Though not from the ceiling like this. And I told him, I say, "Come on, Khazar." How can I possibly paint you right. How? Tell me how? I mean, do you know how the roads in America got so smooth? No. Tell me. Because they're paved with the very bones of smooth guys like Khazar. Right, Khazar? -Really cool guys. -Excuse me. Yeah. So, what do you want? I want nothing. I want my money, I want my diamonds, I want that bitch of a cunt. Or I swear for the bones for your ass, numb-nuts. You'd kill me, like you killed my father? You know what, Arman, you know a lot but more important what you don't understand which is that money sometimes requires a sacrifice. By the way, you finish Olga's portrait? -Why? - I have a recent shot of her. I'm gonna send it right now. [digital beeps] Make it easy for you to finish your work.
