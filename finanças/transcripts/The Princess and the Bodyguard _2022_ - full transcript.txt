Lex, it's 7:45! It's time for that new chapter of our lives... Fall asleep meditating again? No. Let's jump into the deep-end, no hesitation If only we could do it all together Diverging paths will only last As long as we don't work to make it through I tried to leave it all behind But my heart keeps racing back to you And I found love All over again But I can't stay For very long this way I said, I know it's not fair To ask you to leave But if you're willing to with me There's a future I want you to see Let's figure all this out along the way No guarantees, but just look back and see How much we've already been through together Um! - I'm open! - Diverging past Will only last As long as we can work to make it through... Come in. Please, come in. welcome. You made everything here? I did. Oh, I love this. Thank you. It's actually one of my favorites. Oh, that's out of my price range, I'm afraid. No problem. Come on. What? Something's going on with you. What is it? I'm fine. You are not fine. Plus, these potato skins have been here 12 minutes and you haven't even looked at them. I'm just, um... It's my parents. They're flying in tomorrow for my birthday and they wanna take me to lunch. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Wow. Ooh! That's so terrifying! It is! - It is. - Really? Yeah. Okay, well, even if it's a total disaster, I'm gonna take you out in style. I know a guy who knows a guy who owns this awesome bar and he's gonna give us the VIP treatment, baby. Whoo! What?! Shh... All right, fine, Gary. I better go. I suppose I better get back to work. Mm-hmm. - I hate my job. - I know. Happy Birthday! What?! Amazing! Oh... Whoa. Are we expecting guests? I thought you might need the energy for the afternoon with the parents! Thank you. This is awesome. Oh, here. Your performance has been quite disappointing, as I suspected. Therefore, I'll be filing a report with Mr. O'Hara. You are dismissed for the remainder of the day, pending Mr. O'Hara's decision. But I do suggest that you seek possible employment elsewhere. That is all. Good day. Excuse me... Jonathan. Yes. Mm-hmm. Absolutely. Yes. Absolutely. Okay. Ciao. - Excuse me. - Yes? I'm here to meet my parents for lunch? Do they work here? No, they're guests. They checked in this morning. Hmm. Name? Alfred and Charlotte Bernadotte. Alfred and... The King... And Queen of Sentovia. Yes, that's them. I do apologize, Miss Bernadotte. It's fine. Don't worry about it. They are expecting you in our dining room. Please allow me to escort you. I'll find them on my own. Thanks. I'm so sorry once again, Miss Bernadotte. Good day. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. You guys look great. Couldn't have just done this at a diner? Ooh, I wish we had thought of that. Happy birthday, darling. Happy Birthday, Alexia. Thank you so much. It's been far too long since we've seen you. Ooh, have I grown any? Only in your impudence, darling. Phew, I was afraid I lost that. Never. You take after your father. So... how are you? Great. The ceramic store is doing really well. And I just started teaching private pottery lessons, which has been really fun. - Oh, that's nice. - Boyfriend? Nope. Just happy being free and doing my thing at the moment. Good for you, Alexia. I've missed you so. Those Zoom calls just aren't the same. I know. I feel the same way. We can't let so much time pass without seeing each other. It won't, Alexia. That's why we're here. Oh, how so? Tell her, Charlotte. Thank you, Alfred. Do you remember when you were a young girl and we told you that when you turned 20, we wanted you to have the opportunity to live your own life any way you wished? How could I forget? Even if it took you away from the scrutiny and responsibilities of being part of the royal family. And when I turned 20, I told you I wanted to live in America, especially New York City, and you both agreed. Yes. But... But? There is a bit more to the arrangement that we'd like to discuss with you. What's that? Charlotte, please explain. Thank you, Alfred. When the firstborn of the monarchy has reached the age of 35, it must be announced to the people whether he or she has agreed to the eventual line of succession. What does that mean? It means, you will return and resume your responsibilities as the Royal Princess. Princess?! And I'm learning this now? You just forget to mention it in the last 15 years? No. We didn't forget. We just... incorrectly assumed that you would decide at some point before you turned 35 to return to your home. No, it's too late. I have a life here. I have my work and my friends. I'm not going anywhere. Alexia, we are your parents and we love you, and we would not, could not, force you to do anything that you oppose. But we do ask you that you take serious consideration, however. Consideration, for the tradition of your homeland that goes back 500 years and for the people of your country. You always said you wanted to help people, make the world a better place. Well, imagine how many people you could help as the royal princess, perhaps millions. How much time would I have to decide? Two weeks. Two weeks? We have scheduled a gala here in New York in two weeks. The invited guests only believe that they are only here for the benefit of a charity. But we had hoped to introduce you there as princess and heir to the throne, before we all return to Sentovia. We thought you could even create an original sculpture to be auctioned off on the night. And what if I decide the answer is no? Then, we will return to Sentovia and announce that there is now no succession to the family line and I will... What? Abdicate as King. You would really give up the crown, so that I could continue my life here? Alfred: We love you, Alexia. It is exciting friends here! I haven't seen you guys in so long! Right, Lex? Lex? Earth to Lex? Sorry. What happened today? Did they tell you were adopted? I wish. Well, it's behind you now, and should all have fun, right? I will, I will. Good because there's a really cute guy behind you, and he keeps checking you out. So, if you don't go over there, I will. I'm not doing that. Uh, yes, you are. No, I'm not. Okay, I will go and drag him over here, and you know I will. It's not happening. You asked for this. Okay! Okay, okay! I will go talk to him for one minute, that's all. - Hey. - Hey. It's my birthday today. Oh. Happy birthday. Thanks. Wanna get a drink with us? Oh, no. I-I can't. I'm on duty. You're working security here. Yeah. Awesome. Well, keep up the good work. Oh, my... That was the fastest rejection ever. He's works security here. Thanks, thanks a lot. I didn't know! I love this song! Let's dance. Oh, did she get to me One time, baby But I'll let you win again Is it true? Could it be? Can you see the walls and through me? Do you know? Like I do There's a secret something that's hiding in you Could you be the hero I'm looking for? Oh... Oh, boy... You! Come... Come here! That was your fault. I'm... I'm really sorry. What is it? It was a beautiful ceramic vase with a floral design, and now it's a thousand pieces of clay. Um, here, let me pay for it. You're that guy from the bar last night, and on my run this morning, and creeping outside my store today. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't call the police. Um... Why are you following me? Well, I'm... - A-a... journalist? - No. Well, then, who are you? I work for your parents. My parents? Yeah. They hired me. To do what? To protect you. Here. Uh... You got me a bodyguard?! Well... don't think of him like that. His name is Noah, and he's just there to make you feel a little bit more secure. I've been living in New York for the last fifteen years. I think I can take care of myself just fine. We know that, but it would put our minds at rest. For what?! Anyone who might think about kidnapping you for ransom. Kidnapping? I'm 35 and I have a green belt in taekwondo! Oh, and... he'll also be accompanying you on your dates. My what? Don't get angry. It's, uh... It's tradition to bring a date to the gala. It's been like that for generations. So... we've organized a few... suitable bachelors for you to choose from. No. That's crazy, I'm not... Please, sweetheart? Do it for me. You might even enjoy it, especially when you see the cr√®me de la crme of single men that we've lined up for you. Fine. Lexi I can't do this. Who am I? How do I tell my friends? I don't wanna change. But I can help millions of people. Chrissy? Uh, you're home early. I quit my job. - What? - Mm-hmm. Gary had the nerve to tell me that I was intimidating customers. Can you believe that? N-no. No. Really? Yeah! So, I just took my apron off, and threw it in his face and just walked right outta there. - Wow. - It actually felt really good, a sense of freedom! Wow. What are you gonna do? Well, I am 33, and I've always worked in a bar my entire adult life. So, I thought maybe I should grow up and get a real job, somewhere where I would evolve and flourish and showcase my real talents. Good for you. What job is that? I don't know yet, but there will be one, and I can finally figure out who I'm gonna be, my purpose, my destiny. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, I do. Yeah. It's gonna be good. Aren't bodyguards supposed to hang back and be, like, invisible? So, Rob, what do you do? I play polo. Oh, water polo? Uh, on horseback. Oh... That's a job? It is if you're as good as I am. Wow. Yeah, I'm probably top three players in the world right now. That's... that's awesome. Thanks. Hi. I will have the steak, extra onions, and a side of fries. Thank you. Uh, nothing for me. So, you're just gonna watch me eat, huh? Hey. You don't get a body like this by eating fries. Whoa. Okay. So, you're just gonna... You wanna touch? No, thanks, not before I eat. So, Rob, where do you live? Originally, my family's from Sweden. My Father is second in line to the throne there. Oh, yeah? Wow. So, what brings you to New York? Just, uh... Just this, actually. You came all this way just for me? I hope I'm not a disappointment. Oh, no, no, no, no. That was quite a pause there, Rob. Sorry. I'm just... I'm thinking about my girl back home. You have a girl back home? - Oh, yeah, love of my life. - Okay. Matilda. - Isn't she gorgeous? - Uh-huh. It's the only female that's never let me down. You know, this beauty and I, she's won five WPC titles with me. No girlfriend could ever love me as much as she does. Anyway, enough about me. What do you think about polo? Well, since you asked, I think it's kinda barbaric, actually. A bunch of fully grown men forcing these beautiful animals, against their will, to carry them around on their back, just so they can hit a ball with a stick for this so-called sport? I'm afraid your precious Matilda does not love you. She hates you. She wants to get away from you, and I think I know how she feels. This is ridiculous. Do you really have to be everywhere I go? That's my job. Then I guess you'll be joining me for my ten mile run tomorrow. I guess so. At 5 a.m. 5 a.m. My royal date can be a royal bore Mm. I forgot to tell you. Guess who has a job interview tomorrow. Really? Mm-hmm. I'm talking about me, by the way. Yeah, I got that. That's awesome. Where is it? It's at this really nice, five star hotel. It's super classy. You have to wear nice clothes and everything. Awesome. Well, good luck. Ahh, I don't need it, so you can keep it. I have a good feeling about this. I got this one in the bag, I can feel it. Maybe, in a couple years, I'll even own the place. Every time at seven Look at this garbage. I can't believe I used to watch this stuff when I was a little girl. What do you mean? Pretty little princess who basically has everything she wants and she's still not happy until a hunky guy comes along? I mean, what kind of message is that to girls? Where are the kid movies about real, hardworking, independent girls like us, you know? Just trying to make our way through life, you know? Totally. Sha la la la la la la la Sha la la la la la la la Sha la la la la la la la Can we stop for a minute?! Nope. Just thought I'd stop and say hello To show you how deep my love goes I hope you'll turn and look my way Paparazzi. 'Cause your smile outshines The brightest light of day Yeah Lexi?! Chrissy Miller? That's me. My name is Jonathan. I am the hotel's deputy manager. Nice to meet you, Jonny. Mmm. Jonathan. Okay. Are those apples free? 'Cause I never had breakfast and I'm starving! I'm afraid those are for guests only. Oh. So, to begin, if you're serious about working here, you may want to rethink the way you present yourself. Um... why is that? Well, this is a five-star hotel, Miss Miller. Chrissy. Mm. Miss Miller. One of the finest in New York. The sort of clientele who come through that door expect to be met with a certain... standard. Oh... Well, who's the most famous person who stayed here? Any Knicks players or rock stars? Well, we currently have the King and Queen of Sentovia with us. Sen... Where is that? Europe. Oh. So, that's the level of guest we deal with here. Got it. So, when do I start? Miss Miller, I'm not going to waste any more of your time. I don't think this is the right job for you. Why? I just got here. You don't even know me. Well, when you've been in the business as long as I have, you develop an instinct for this sort of thing. I see. No, I don't think you do. You stand there with that face and that haircut and those designer knock-off glasses, and you put down on the people of this city? How dare you judge me 'cause I am New York. And you know what, Jonny? I would never work in a dump like this. Never. I'm taking two. Oh, I wouldn't stay here; there's rats. - Rats! - That's a little joke. No, please don't leave. No. That was a little joke. Rats... Now, I've said it. Hello. Yes. Um, I'm actually waiting for someone, but I'll have a glass of your champagne. Thank you. No, I'm Alexia. Oh. Oh! Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry. It's fine. No, no. It's just how you're... Yeah. I get it. Charles, Earl of Camshire. Earl, huh? Is that higher or lower than a Duke? Lower. Oh, I was just... That was a joke. I don't care about that stuff. Oh, right, a joke, of course. How wonderful. Beer, please. Oh, okay. I will... you know what? I will have one of those too. Can I just say? I love this whole 'normal' thing you're doing? What do you mean? You know, the clothes, beer. This is just how I am. Oh. Right. I get it, I get it. You know, I really think it's important that people like us appear relatable to the public. I... Which is why I'm on social media. I really want the whole world to catch a glimpse of life as a royal. Um, right. And how many followers do you have? 83. Well, I've only been on a few weeks, you know. It takes time for word to spread. Mm-hm. In fact... you and I should grab a little pic right now. Okay. "On a hot date... "in New York. "About to have a beer. "LOL!" The fans are going to love that. Charles, I hope you don't take offence to this question, but... how old are you? 24. Wow, okay. Well, I'm 35. That doesn't bother you? No, not at all. You see, I like old women. What a strange man. - Thanks. - Thank you. Mm. Cheers. A couple of normal people. Ooh. Lot of gas. Something funny? Sorry. No. Well, I just... I can't believe he said that. - Said what? - "Old women"? I mean, come on, what was the guy thinking? How do you know what he said to me? Uh... Wait a minute. Did you put a wire on me? No, no. I, uh... I can read lips. It comes in handy in this line of work. Well, I'd really rather you didn't listen to my private conversations. I don't believe that's a part of your job description. Understood. Sorry, Princess. You know what, Noah? I get that this is just another job for you and you probably go to the bar every night with all your jock buddies and have a good laugh at me, but this is my actual life, and it's just been turned completely upside down. I don't know who I am. I don't know how I'm gonna tell my best friend that I've been lying to her for the last ten years. I don't even know if I can do this. I don't know anything anymore! I love my life here, and now it might be over, and I'm really scared and all alone. So, sorry if I don't see the funny side. And another thing, Mr. Lip Reader, see if you can catch this. Don't... call me Princess. My name is Lexi. - I can't do it, Mom. - Sweetheart... I don't want it. I know you don't. Please, just tell me I don't have to do it. Listen to me. I know this must be overwhelming for you, and you probably feel like you're the only person in the world who's going through it. But the truth is that there's a moment in everybody's life where they finally become the person that they were always supposed to be. And it's uncomfortable and it's painful and it's frightening, but it's inevitable; it's their destiny. I don't want to change. I like who I am. Who you are on the inside doesn't need to change. It's just your surroundings. Oh, just my surroundings. Your empathy, your kindness, your sense of humor, your creativity - all of those wonderful things, you can take with you into this exciting new world. Hmm? You can decide what kind of a princess you want to be. You can still work at your sculptures, you can travel the world, become a symbol of love and hope. You're being offered a golden opportunity to have an extraordinary life and help a lot of people, and you can do it your way. Hmm? Oh... Don't just throw it away because you're afraid. It's too much, Mom. I know, baby. Give it time. I never would have chosen this normal existence if I knew you were just gonna take it away. I'm sure you must feel like that at the moment, but you'll look back one day and you'll be so grateful for all these experiences, trust me. I wish I had that. How have the dates been? Disastrous. Oh, dear. Well, the first two were your father's choices. Mm-hmm. The last one is mine. Why can't I just arrive alone? There are... ways things are done. It's important. - Hey, bud. - Hey. You good? Man: Yeah, I'm good. Are you sure? 'Cause, um, you've been kind of quiet lately. Hey, look, if there's someone bullying you at school, you just let me know and I'll go pay them a visit, okay? It's about a girl. It's about a girl? Yes, it is. Mm-hmm. Of course. Yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. Who's the girl? Well, I don't even know her name, but she works at the grocery store and she's awesome. She's got this beautiful crooked smile, and long, curly red hair, like molten lava. - Wow. - Yeah, but, like... I don't know what to say. Like, what do I do? I just freeze up, like, almost every single time. I... I don't know if I'm the right guy to be asking for romantic advice. Well, you did manage to trick somebody into marrying you. That's right, I did, didn't I? It's just that's such a long time ago now. Oh, yeah. Sorry. I shouldn't have mentioned it. Sorry. Hey, hey, no. It's okay. It's okay, all right? Look, there's... there's no easy way around this stuff, right? So, you just gotta tell her. Really? I mean, that seems a bit, like, out there. Yeah. You just gotta... You just gotta tell her, otherwise, you'll never know. Right? It's like what mom used to say, "There's nothing worse in this life than regret." - You know what you should do? - What? - You should write her a letter. - A letter? Yeah, yeah. Just write her a letter, and you should just take it to the store and give it to her the next time you're there. Okay, sure. But, like, what would I say? I don't know. Anything. All that stuff you told me about her smile and about her hair, write in all that. Okay? That stuff's gold. You're so good with your words; she'll love it. Wow. Okay. Thanks. That's actually, like, really helpful. Paper, pen, words. Okay, yeah, I get it: you're old fashioned. - It's about a girl! - It's about a girl! - Hey. - Hey. How's it going? Yeah, you know, just average, just a totally average day. Oh. The job interview, how'd it go? Oh, uh... great. They loved me, obviously. They basically gave me the job. I'm just keeping my options open, you know? Okay, well, I'm gonna catch an early night. It's been such a crazy... Average day. Okay. - Night. - Night. Can I just say something? I'm really busy. Yeah, I know. It'll only take a minute. I... I want to apologize. It's okay. No, it's not. I'm an idiot, you know? And sometimes, I don't think about things and how they're affecting people when I'm saying them. I realize that you're going through a lot, and yesterday, when I saw how upset I made you... I shouldn't have blown up at you. No, you should have. I was completely out of line. It won't happen again. - Thanks. - Yeah. In fact, I am now implementing a strict no more, no less than six-feet apart rule at all times. And, and I'm gonna buy something. You don't have to do that. Hey, right now, I'm not your bodyguard, okay? I'm a customer, and the customer's always right. Right? Hi. Hi. I changed my mind. I want to buy this. Oh, yes. Absolutely. I own a restaurant and need this on display. That's great. Get this wrapped up for you. Ooh! Thank you. Thank you. Have a great day. Big sale? Oh, yeah. It's not about the money, though. It's the first time I've sold one of my more artistic pieces, and it's gonna be on display in his restaurant for people to see. Well, congratulations. Thank you. Have you decided what you're gonna get? Yes. Yeah. I'm definitely getting the big, uh, bowl thingy. Okay, bowl thingy. And, um... I'm also gonna get that, uh... Vase? Vase, yes. Right. That'll look great in my place. Great. Where do you live? Oh, just about a five-ten minute walk from here. Well, I've got my lunch break, so I can help you walk it over. Oh, no, no. That... That's not a good idea. Why not? Well, it's just not really a good place for someone, uh... - Where a...? - It's just not really a safe neighborhood for you to be going to, is all. Well, it's a good thing I've got my big, strong bodyguard to protect me. I guess I deserve that. Come on, Chrissy, today's the day. This is the one. They're gonna beg you to take the job! They're not interviewing you, you're... interviewing... them! Let's go! Well, here it is. Looks pretty good, huh? - Brother: No, no, no. - Not bad. So, you're like the... Princess of England, right? It's... it's not England, bud. It's... - Sentovia. - Sentovia. Where's that? Well, it's in, uh... Europe. - Europe. - Ah. Yeah. So, are you like really rich? - Mikey... - What? - It's fine. - No, it's not fine. All right? It's rude, okay? You can't just ask people that. Okay, okay. Excuse me... Is this...? Yeah, that's Noo Noo. No, it's nothing. It's nothing. Oh, it's something. Noo Noo? When I was a baby, we couldn't say 'Noah', so we just called him 'Noo Noo' and it just kinda stuck. You know? He hates it. I bet. All right, all right. Good. Um... Could I get you some more coffee? - Please. - Okay, good. No more for you, all right? Oh, okay. Yeah, I see how it goes. Bye! Thanks, Noo Noo. That was too good. Yeah. Okay, tell me everything. Okay. So, there was this one time, we were playing catch and, uh, you know, I was getting... This used to be a great youth center when I was growing up. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Me and my friends used to come here all the time. Yeah, kept us out of a lot of trouble. I wish Mikey had a place like this to come to. I worry he's just stuck in the house all the time. What happened to it? Well, the government cut funding for things like this, so it's just another abandoned building in the neighborhood now. This whole neighborhood is just getting worse and worse. You know, I wish I could do something about it, I just don't know where to start. So, it's just you and your brother? Yeah. Mom passed a few years ago, so I've just been taking care him since then. Kid's my whole world, you know? Should we keep on going? - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. I can take it from here. You still haven't told her yet, huh? Well, there's no point until I make a final decision, is there? I guess not. See you tomorrow? Yeah. Yeah, see you tomorrow. Alexia! Are you Princes s Alexia of Sentovia? Are you pretending to be a normal person? - Can you back up, please? - Can you just give me a... Hey, hey. Get away from her! You're not allowed to touch me! Okay, I apologize. Let's keep going, though. - I would love... - That's enough. Let's go. - Whoa. - Yeah. If anything like this happens again when I'm not around, just, uh, give me a call. Thanks. Okay. Maybe I should stick around this time, while you... - Yeah. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. Man on video call: Well, Chrissy, you seem like the perfect candidate for this position. Really? Great, great. You should definitely come in for a second interview. Yes, that's perfect. Thank you. Hey. Man: Great. I'll see you tomorrow morning. Yes, absolutely. See you then. That sounded like it went well. I crushed it! And it's a cool place too. I mean, the only downside is I have to listen to that guy's boring robot voice. - Did you hear it? - Yeah. Mm-hmm. "I'll see you in the morning." Exactly. Man: Erm, Chrissy, I don't think you hung up properly. I am.. so sorry. I'm not really good with all this... This technology. I... Okay. It's okay. We'll get the next one. Oh, my... - Wine? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. What if you played with my heart? Making up rules as you go Would it be fair from the start? This is a game we don't know Everyone that we see appears to be happy and lovey dovey And maybe that could be you and me if only we try - Do you wanna stop? - No, I'm good. - Let's keep going. - You sure? Yeah, you wanna stop? - No. - All righty then. You might be someone to make me better A small confusion is just an illusion 'Cause you were always the one who could make me better This is stupid. It's not stupid. It's good for your mental well-being. How often do you have to do this? Twice a day. What?! Who has time for this? You gotta close your eyes. I can't. I'm being paid to watch you. It's 6:00 AM. There's no one around. You think I'm gonna get kidnapped by a gang of pigeons? Fine. I'll close one eye. It's the best I can do. Okay, what am I saying now? Noah is really annoying and I wish he'd leave me alone. That's not very nice. Okay, all right. You can read lips. - Okay, ready? - Yep. - Oh! - Good. - All right? - Yeah. Okay, let's get it spinning. Okay. - So now we wet the clay. - Okay. Okay, so, remember to use your thumbs to dig into the center and work outwards from there. You wanna be firm, but gentle at the same time. Okay. Okay, good, good, good, good, good. Oh, less palm, less palm. Yep, very good, very good. Okay, okay, all right, all right. - Okay, watch yourself. - Okay. - Okay. - Wow, what do you call that? Well, I was gonna try and make, you know, a boring, old bowl, but, I decided to get a little creative with it. Looks like it's time for your third date. Come on. It's the last one. Okay, let's get this over with. Ah. I didn't know he was the president of the company. - You really said that? - Yeah. Wow. The whole being a duke thing doesn't come naturally to me. I don't even want any of this to be honest, but, my parents sat me down one day and said, "Marcus, this is your duty to your country and millions of people are depending on you." Then I realized that I could make a lot of people's lives much better. That's more important, you know? I do. It's nice to hear about someone else struggling with all of this. You seem so normal. Well, thank you. I take that as huge compliment. You should. I'm still trying to come to terms with everything. I totally understand. Your situation's really tough. You know, to have all this freedom for so long and have it taken away. - Must be terrifying for you. - Kinda. Well, if I may say, you seem to be handling it brilliantly. I think you're very brave, Lexi. Oh? And not to mention, very beautiful. Oyster? I've actually never had one before. Hm. Well, there's a first time for everything. All right. Good luck. Mm, yeah, that wasn't so bad. Yeah, he's nice. Not like the others. That's great. So, he'll probably be the one you take to that big, fancy gala thing then? Oh, I don't know. Maybe? We'll see. Sounds like you may have finally found your prince charming after all. Sorry, not funny. So, seeing as how you find my dating life so amusing, I'm presuming you're in a steady relationship and don't have to deal with these things. No, I'm single. Quit the dating game about six years ago now. Quit? Aren't you a little young for that? What happened? - I... I was married. - Ah. And she died. Oh, I'm so sorry. No, it's fine. Six years is a long time. She got sick and, uh, she fought really hard, but, um... I just felt a lot of guilt afterwards for a long time. Just thought I'd be able to protect her from anything. You know? Look at me telling you my sob story. - Not very professional. - No, it's nice. I mean, it's okay. There's nothing in that bodyguard rule book about being friends with your client, is there?
