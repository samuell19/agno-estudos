[eerie music playing] [Charles Carson] "Carson's Colour Schemer" "Tomorrow's world of colour, today." [cows mooing] [mooing continues] Welcome to Coombe End Farm! Follow me down. I've got something to show you. [VCR clicks] I don't know where to even begin with this story. We've been collecting weird VHS tapes since 1991, and by far this is the weirdest one we've seen. [man] This is dark, but it's, like, "friendly" dark. You would never think it's dead, look! [man] We've unearthed something and nobody's quite sure what it is. [man] I came across something that's so... obscure and hidden away... [man] It's been... an experience watching all of this. It looks like a fucking horror movie! There's all manner of craziness. [laughs] I think, is the easiest way to describe it! [man] The more I found out about it, the more I realized that this had to have an audience. [man] I think he wanted the whole world to see this. [ID] And nothing's stayed with me quite like, quite like "Life On The Farm", no. That is a truly special work of art. I owed it to the man and I owed it to his work. [man] He was ahead of his time. - [man] Absolutely unique. - [man] Highly absurd. [man] He was a great character, he was an individual. -He was a showman. [man] Terrifying! You don't meet many people like Charles. Hi there! It is a little bit reminiscent of the serial killer Ed Gein. I can't tell if this guy is a genius or a psychopath! Come on, pussy, let's go. [laughs]. This is the story of Charles Carson and "A Life on the Farm." [laughs] Ah well, here we go! [cow mooing] It's probably best to start when my family comes in. Particularly my grandfather, John Harding. He did play a part in my love of film and writing. He was a bit of a poet and all that kind of thing. And, of course, you know, a staunch supporter of all that went on in Huish Champflower. [Oscar] Huish Champflower is a pretty remote place. It's nearby a village called Wiveliscombe, but it's sort of spaced out so that your neighbors aren't really neighbors. Some of them are maybe five, ten minutes' drive away, and that's your closest neighbor. I do know it was my mom's wish to move into the country. She seemed very keen to move away. They really got into being part of the local town and area. The sort of communities like the communities around here are quite unique in a way, and how much longer will they stay like this? [Oscar] One of John and Trisha's neighbors was a farmer called Charles Carson. Come on, my dears. Beef is beautiful! Come on, my dear! Up you get! [Oscar] Charles had, at some point, given my grandpa a copy of "Life on the Farm," a feature-length home movie he had made. Well, there you are, everybody. If you want to get up in the morning, come and see us at Coombe End Farm. [Oscar] When John died in 2006, the family went down to his house and started clearing out his possessions, and one of my aunts found a videotape. [harmonica playing] [Charles] Charles Carson, Coombe End Farm. So it's me and my kid sister, she's 5 or 6 at the time. I'm about 10 years old, and it's our first time ever watching "Life On The Farm." Let's put a little bit of grass on the top of you. That's lovely. Yeah. You'll have a lovely time in there. [VCR clicks] [Oscar] Halfway through, Dad just shuts off the tape. And that was the last time I saw that film for around a decade. We moved house, lost the tape, and then one day I bring it up in conversation with my aunt and she says, "Oh, that old tape! Yeah, yeah! I've got that buried away somewhere! Give me a couple of days to find it." So I'm waiting, and I'm hoping that it's every bit as amazing and weird as I remember it being. So, she gives me the tape and I sit down by myself, lights off, and for the first time in around 10 years, I see "Life On The Farm." ["Old Macdonald Had a Farm" playing] [Charles] Here I am, Charles Carson. I'm taking some more pictures. Keep your eyes open, everybody! [laughs] This is a lovely, lovely video. All these memories start flooding back and the images are exactly how I remember them. Oh, it's marvelous, isn't it? [Charles] Have you got your, uh, video set up? I'm ready to play you some lovely pictures. [cows mooing] [mooing continues] [Oscar] The video starts off and it all feels a little bit amateur. And then Charles Carson introduces himself. Hi there, I'm Charles Carson. [Oscar] Then he introduces himself again... Charles Carson. Coombe End Farm. [Oscar] And then he introduces himself for a third time... Charles Carson. Coombe End Farm. Because he mentions Coombe End Farm so, so often, "Charles Carson, Coombe End Farm! Charles Carson, Coombe End Farm!" [multiple Carsons speaking] Charles Carson! Coombe End Farm! Coombe End Farm! He did do this, and there was a lot of thumb involved. And there was lots of "ha! ha! ha!". [Charles laughing repeatedly] Ha-ha-ha ... ha-ha-ha. [all laughing together] When he thinks he's being funny, he says, "ha! ha! ha!" Keep your eyes open, everybody! [laughs] And when he is saying something a bit more matter-of-fact, it's a "Ha! ha!" See you sometime. [laughs] And I think when he's getting a little bit existential, it's "Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!" Wonderful, isn't it? Charles Carson, Coombe End Farm. [laughs] [laughs] Beautiful! In the opening scene, he does a piece to camera and then he turns away and walks towards the house, and then he sort of stops and remembers that he's got to come back and turn the camera off. And to this day, I'm still not entirely sure if it was deliberate. [rooster crowing] [rooster crowing continues] We've been collecting weird footage just for our own entertainment for years, and then over the last 15 years, though, we've been touring with it all around the world, and we realized not only is there an audience for this stuff, but there's also other people doing similar things like Everything Is Terrible!, TV Carnage, Derrick Beckles... all sorts of weirdos, just like us. ["Old Macdonald Had a Farm" playing] Oh, they love hats! [laughs] He really gets a kick out of horses taking his hats, -and people's hats, that's, uh, -Who doesn't? that is an endless source of entertainment, -and who can blame him? -That's "Life on the Farm"! She's lovely, this one. Oh, he's got my hat as well! Come on, give me my hat back. What are you doing, my dear? Oh, he's got my hat! Oh, he's got my hat! Oh, this cow is 26 years old. She's never going to calve. I'll have to pull the calf away. There is a lot of footage of cow births, uh, in excruciating detail. [Charles] Come on my dear. Come on, my dear. Come on, he's nearly there. Come on, my dear. Come on. Here he comes. Come on, my dear. Whoo! There we are. Oh, what a lovely calf. Well done, my dear, there we are. -There we are. -[liquid gushing] Come on. There we are, my dear. Another one coming, come on! Come on! Another calf coming. It's painful and difficult and needs a helping hand if one's around. Come on, out we come. Come on, out we come. Here we go. [cow mooing] Out we come! Here we are! Here we are. Fancy you having twins. Good Lord! I didn't know you were going to have twins! Hi there! Sooty, as you know, has just given birth to a pair of twins. And now luckily, she's managed to discharge the afterbirth. This is technically known as the placenta. I'm not sure if you've seen a close up of this, but let me bring it in a bit closer to you. And you'll have a jolly good look at a placenta. Isn't that wonderful? Look at that. Enormous, isn't it? My father and mother lived on this farm for many years, and my father lived to be 89 years old and my mother lived to be 95 years old. And they had beef nearly every day! Come on, my dear, come on! They had beef nearly every day. Well, there you are! So all I can say is, go away to the shops and buy yourself some beef. It's all quite sweet, and innocent enough, until we get to the point where Charles is sat down in front of the fireplace and he's talking about one of his cats. Hi there, the pussycats on this farm are absolutely lovely. We've got several pussycats. Beautiful, aren't they? [laughs] Absolutely lovely! Today, one of our famous little pussycats has died. We filmed it a couple of years ago on Remembrance Day with a poppy around its neck, celebrating Poppy Day. Well, there you are, that's life on a farm. Little Pandy used to be a little piano player, come on, Pandy! Come on, let me put a poppy around your neck, and we'll take you down the orchard... Take you down the orchard, Pandy, come on, my dear. Little poppy around your neck, my dear, there you are. Well, there's, there's, little Pandy. You would never think it's dead, look! Beautiful little pussycat, six years old. We've got three more. So there we are, that's life on the farm. We'll take him down the orchard. Right, Pandy, come back here while I get a little, little box for you and take you down the orchard, and bury you in the orchard, my dear. Well, there we are, that's life on the farm. He was almost, kind of, like a a morning show presenter with everything, where it was just a kind of, very "up" attitude. Very, very pleasant, very positive. Even holding his own dead cat. It's Remembrance Day today. And your little friend died today, Little Pandy. Right, we'll dig this hole. That's deep enough, I think. That should be deep enough. Right, there we are. Come on, my dear. Let's have a last look at you, you beautiful little pussy. He used to go to sleep in this English apple box in the kitchen. He used to make a little bed in there. There you are, my dear. Let's put you in a little grave, down in the orchard on Coombe End Farm, there you are. [Karen] He's about to bury this cat. And this is the last time we're all going to see it, and he wants to memorialize his pet, which is actually very sweet and kind of sad. [Charles] Now, put a little bit of soil on the top. There we go. [shovel scraping] Yeah, that's lovely. That's beautiful. Well, there you are, Pandy. Come on, pussycats, come down and see your little friend and say goodbye. Come on. Oh, pussy! Don't break my back, my dear! [Lehr] I really liked the moment when he was burying the cat and he was doing that freeze-frame when the cat jumped on his back. And it's just like those little VFX moments in VCRs that I just I love so much. Yeah, I laughed out loud when I first saw that. And it's, like, "Oh, don't jump on my back! Oh, you'll break my back!" I was like, "Mmm!" He just had to show that cat jumping on his back, even though it was going to give away that he was putting cat food down on this grave, so that the cats could give their respects to their fallen comrade. Yeah. Then we have a photo montage of Charles and his mother. ["There's No One Quite Like Grandma" playing] [Charles] Mother's registered blind, she's got to go to hospital. Here she is in hospital, getting her eyes seen to. And here she is, she's coming back home to feed the livestock. ["There's No One Quite Like Grandma" playing] [Charles] Musgrove Park Hospital. Here she is, she's home again. She's getting a lot better. There she is, playing with the chicken again. ["There's No One Quite Like Grandma" playing] [Charles] Well, there we are, there's Millie Carson. She's passed away, having had a lovely time on the farm. Well, there you are. My mother passed away in front of the fire. And this was the point that Dad had originally turned off the tape when I was a kid. [Charles] And this is the Reverend Chris Marshall. I got him to come along to give her a blessing. Thank you, Christopher. [Chris] I do remember quite clearly going to the, to the farmhouse when the old lady died and she was still sitting in the chair there. And I think probably I gave her a blessing or something or other. Normally, I would just put my hand on them and give them a blessing and command them to God's loving mercy and care, you know? Then the rest is up to Him. And I can remember thinking that the house was, I wasn't quite sure where the house began and where the farmyard began, because they seemed to run into each other. The chickens and things seemed to have, you know, free access everywhere, really. [Charles] Chirpy! Granny Carson's given you a lovely breakfast. I think he then wheeled his mother out into the yard to sort of say farewell to the cow and the chickens and the rest of it! [Charles] And this is Millie's cows. And the, the cow's having a look at her and I wonder what the cow's saying? "Thank you, Millie, my dear." ["There's No One Quite Like Grandma" playing] This is a genuine picture taken on the farm. Well, there you are. This is Millie, passed away. [Joe] And then that "Grandma" song comes on, which I've never heard that song before, but it's the scariest, creepiest song to put under anything. -[Nick] Yeah! -[Joe] It's like a horror movie. [Nick] It's like in Casino, you know, it's like a Scorsese touch, where it's a song that sort of plays against what's happening on the screen. It's exactly like Scorsese. No different. [Charles] There you are, you can hardly believe it. I brought my mother in to see her cows after she passed away. I did used to see the mother out in the field, you know, and, I found out afterwards that she'd died and he'd put her out in the field, as he told me, "So the cows could pay their last respects." You know, I hadn't, kind of, twigged that I was going past, and she was over the other side of the fence, but she was actually no longer with us. She just looked like she always looked, sort of asleep. Slightly bizarre, I suppose. But, um, there, I suppose when you think about it, it was helpful to the family. And then later on in the video, you also see a photo of Charles posing with his father. [Charles] Well, there he is. He's in bed and he's not very well. And he says "A whiskey a day keeps the doctor away." But he never took too much. He's never been drunk in his whole life. He had a lovely time on the farm, but here he is. He says, "I'm 89 and I'm not very well today." Well, he wasn't very well, because he passed away. Well, there he is. [Chris] I mean, I think I just took it in my stride, really. In fact, in this line of business, you quite often just have to sort of go with the flow, really, take it in your stride. This is what people are like, this is what families are like. And you're there to help in any way that you can, I guess. The done thing becomes what humans do when one of their own kind dies, and except for the accessories, it doesn't change. The essentials are pretty much the same. We get the dead guy where they need to go. And by doing so, the living get where they need to be. That's the formula. That's why we do it. [Nick] It's almost like a frog in boiling water, where you don't realize how weird it is because it's happening so slowly. But then when you stop and think about it, you're like, "Oh God!" You can kind of, like, put people into a state of it being normalized and then you kind of, like, wake up halfway through and you're like, "Whoa! Whoa! Wait a second!" [laughs] You can't just "Please and excuse me" yourself through this. Uh, this is insane! The film finishes and... I just kind of sit there in shock. And your first thoughts are, "What have I just watched? Who the hell is this guy? I need to know everything." [Charles] [laughs] Charles Carson. Oh, look at that. That's me! Well, there we are, there's Stan Carson, my father. This is Stan Carson's wife, Millie Carson, which is my mother. She had two babies. Frank Carson and myself, Charles Carson. And we were on Higher Stolford Farm for several years, and had a lovely time. Anyway, um, mother decided in the end that she would sell the farm and buy another one. Yes, well, there we are. There's Coombe End Farm. My mother, Millie Carson, bought this, this farm and she went to Wiveliscombe auction and bid for it in 1943 and bought it very, very cheap. My family bought the farm Higher Schute farm, which is right opposite Coombe End Farm, where Charles and his family were. So that's how, you know, we got, I got to know him. I was only seven at the time and I was being a little tacker, I suppose, I soon picked up that I could go over there and follow Charles. And he was doing various things that interested me, and he used to deliver steaks around Exmoor. And I can remember us taking some steaks to different farms. He used to say, you know, "Tomorrow I'm going to deliver some steaks, Reg, if you want to come." And I'd pop over and we'd go out. He used to bale our hay, you know, father's hay. At the time, Kirkley Hall was part of the local county council. It was a government-run organization, and it was their, I suppose, their agricultural college. [man] We were amazed, like I said, in '55 when he suddenly went off the scene and we heard that he'd gone and got this job in a college. [dramatic music] He would be involved in training the students how to repair the machines, how to service them, but also how to operate them when they use them in the field. I did take that he was a bit of a character. He was, he was very knowledgeable. He knew what he was talking about, but he also had his own particular way of doing things as well. This is my latest invention. I've converted a push lawnmower into a ride-on. It's absolutely marvelous. All you've got to do is to start it up, squeeze the lever, and away you go. Even a child can use it, it's so simple. Let me give you a demonstration. You know, he'd had enough of teaching and he wanted to pursue some other interests, I think, outside the college. I've worked with many farmers over the years, and I have a research interest into the mental health difficulties that farmers run into. As those around you grow older, then you may have to care for people around you, your parents or aunts or uncles. So if you're already isolated, already working very hard, already under a lot of pressure, little in the way of social support and caring for an elderly relative, you can only imagine the stresses that that must entail. And it clearly seemed to be the case with Charles. It does appear that perhaps Charles was there on his own without his wife, without his children, caring for elderly parents. It must have been very difficult. [Denise Broom] It's like a step back in time, and it's really, when I picture it, it's rather like a scene from a fairy story, where you go to the unusual house with the unusual people... not in a wood exactly, but you had that feeling of anticipation, when you went down the very long drive to the house, that what would you find this time? Indoors, we would go in to be surrounded by all sorts of brass and copper pans hanging from the walls, and no area seemed free... there was stuff everywhere. And, again, the chickens were on the floor, on the table. The cats were also present, a number of them. So it was, like, otherworldly. I would describe it as slightly eccentric, as a family, you know? They were certainly "one-off," but intelligent with it, I think. [Charles] Well, there we are. There's Stan Carson, my father, Millie Carson's husband. Very nice gentleman. Well, there you are. [Denise] Because his father had served on HMS Hood, he had photographs of his dad and the ship itself, which we then displayed in the church, much to his absolute delight, thrilled to bits to be involved, and was a regular visitor over the three to four days that we ran it. He was up every day. [Charles] Yes, well, there we are. There's my brother, Frank Carson, and he says, "I buy livestock." Well, let's have a look at these livestock. Well, there's my brother, Frank Carson. What are you doing there, Frank? Oh, you're feeding the, um, the chicken. Oh, very good. Oh, and you've got a goose there? Very good. See you, then. Frank was a character in his own right, I think it's fair to say, and in my experience, he was a man of very few words. He said very little. But was this very strong, heavy presence. Whenever we went to see the family, he was sat at the table. [chuckling] [chuckling] ["There's No One Quite Like Grandma" playing] [Charles] This is Mother and myself. We're playing some lovely music. Here we are! Mother says, "A glass a day keeps the doctor away." There you are! His mother was highly intelligent. I mean, she played the piano, apparently, spoke languages, taught in the local school, well, she was extraordinary. So the brains are there all the way through. I mean, he was obviously well taught as a child. And she was much admired. She played 12 instruments. And I often wonder if that's where Charles got the musical talent that he had, because he also played musical instruments as well, amongst all the other things that he did. [harmonica playing] His dear old mother, who, I don't know what age she was then, but she... every time I saw her, she was in this sort of chair, like a wheelchair, but it was like something that he made himself. So, it was kind of, like, a big, sort of, throne kind of, like, chair with these quite small wheels on. And she was kind of, like, asleep in this chair, and he's, sort of, "Mother!", you know, "Mother! Mother! Wake up! We've got a guest! We've got a guest!" And she was sort of, like, and he said, he said, "She can't hear you and she can't see you, she's deaf and blind. Mother! Wake up, we've got a guest!" And he gave her a harmonica, and he said, "Mother, play us a song. You've got a guest, play our guest a song." And she, sort of, blew a few notes out of this harmonica, bless her, and then sort of, kind of, fell back to sleep. If your parent passes away, like, in front of you and you've been caring for them day in and day out, you know, trying to help them through these hardest moments at the end of life... like, what do you do when they're suddenly gone? You've been working so hard day in and day out to keep them going, to keep them happy. And when they're gone, it's just, it's shocking. These are the flowers that Millie Carson planted on this farm about 50 years ago. She's farmed on this farm for 50 years, and prior to that, she farmed on the Brendon Hills at Higher Stolford Farm. She's had a remarkable time on the farm. She enjoyed growing flowers, she enjoyed all the farm animals. She had a lovely time on the farm. She died at the age of 94. Most definitely, Frank's funeral, I find most memorable, indeed! Charles was clearly upset and agitated, but not so much so that he could set up his own tripod and his camera to film all that went on out in the churchyard. [bells ringing] When they came to putting the coffin into the ground, Charlie was there with his camera, running around and he'd say to the pallbearers, "No! No! Hold it there! Hold it there! I'll just get this shot!" And then he'd run around the other side and get another. "All right. You can lower a bit lower, now hold it again!" [laughing] It's much easier to turn a funeral into a film shoot than to turn it into what it is. And I wouldn't fault Charles for that. That is the kind of "whistling past the graveyard" we humans like to do, as if death doesn't matter, but it does. You know, he'd been filming them while they were alive. He was going to keep the camera running even after they died. On reflection, I guess now, you think, maybe that the first signs of his illness were beginning to display themselves. He was clearly not himself, and he did stride across the open grave after the coffin was lowered to sit on the pile of earth that had been exhumed to produce the grave. And, you know, he, he sat there with his mouth organ and played "All Things Bright and Beautiful" [harmonica music playing] It was very touching and yet, a little disturbing. ♪ All things Bright and beautiful ♪ ♪ All creatures Great and small ♪ ♪ All things Wise and wonderful ♪ ♪ The Carsons made them all ♪ [Thomas] I think Charles' reaction when his brother died is that he wanted to do whatever he could do for himself. So rather than choosing a typical liturgical hymn, or a set of prayers, better that he played his harmonica. Well, there you are, you can believe that if you like! That, I think, goes beyond the bounds of eccentricity. I think something was wrong there. It might be explained by the early onset of dementia. One person who's pretty absent from the film is Charles' wife, Helen. [Charles] Oh, there's my wife, Helen. What are you doing, Helen? Oh, you're smoothing the horse down. Watch your hat, my dear! She's enjoying herself on Coombe End Farm. Right, I'm going to see Helen Carson, my wife. Helen! Helen, you're doing a lovely job there, aren't you? Lovely, my dear. [Charles] There's my wife, Helen. She's making Christmas cakes, there's one. This is the Christmas cake. Absolutely lovely. Isn't it? [Charles] That be all? Yes, it's just about finished, yes. [Charles] Well done. Hello there. Have you finished the Christmas cake? Yes, I've just about finished it. Looks pretty, doesn't it? Oh, that's beautiful! -Yes... Well, it's all good ingredients. -All homemade? -Everything homemade. -Lovely. Plenty of alcohol in it. Soaked the fruit the night before in port... Oh, yes? ...so that the alcohol stays in the fruit and not burnt off in the oven. -You've got alcohol in there? -Yes. Well, I've got some here as well. -Have you? Oh, right. -Yeah. -There you are! -Thank you! [glass clinks] Oh, this is lovely! Mmm! Here we are! Well, there we are! Merry Christmas, my dear! Cheers! Happy Christmas! Happy Christmas! Cheers! Oh, that's good, what's that? Ah! That is... Old England sherry! -Oh, right. -That's marvelous! Yes... well I hope that you have a very happy Christmas! Yes. Now then, what about these cattle outside? I'll just finish off here, and put this away, and then I'll be out with you. Right. Well, you just enjoy your sherry, -I'll see you later. -Yes. All right. Well, Helen, I'm going to feed the cows outside. I believe it's snowing. [Charles] Yes, well, here we are. This is my wife, Helen. Um, at the time, just before Christmas 1995, she was in Northumberland looking after her auntie, and she woke up one morning and she had a pain in the head. So she rang, rang up the hospital, rang up the doctor, and she was rushed to hospital and she never recovered. There you are. Very unfortunate. I was down in Somerset at the time, and my son rang me up, and I rushed up to hospital... and there we are. Very, very unfortunate. She passed away. Yes, I took pictures of her in hospital, of course. Yes, and many pictures in the past. This is Coombe End Farm. This is me in hospital, wishing she's going to recover, but unfortunately, she didn't. And here we are. This is me at the church, with the coffin. And I made all these flowers down at Coombe End Farm. She died the age of 57 years old in Northumberland, and buried in Northumberland at Saint Andrew's Church on the 20th of December. [Robert] I think life on a, on a farm it, sort of, takes up so much of your time. My expectation of what it would be like is early starts and late finishes and lots of, uh, manual things to do and a never-ending cycle of things to do. See you. Come on, Jimmy, let's get some di- uh, chicken for dinner. And it is difficult to be brought up in agriculture to, you know, to move to a different type of activity sometimes, especially if there's family commitments and that sort of thing. It can be difficult to pull away from it. So maybe it was his way of escaping and getting out of that a little bit, possibly. Filmmaking is a creative outlet. And this guy is on a farm, he's probably bored out of his skull. And so thank God he picked up a camera. He really had to work at it over a long period, and he was dedicated to it, but I think, yeah, I think it's very true to say that perhaps it was the counterpoint to the, let's face it, quite lonely, rural, isolated existence that most farmers, particularly small farmers, have. Growing up on a farm, you work really hard, but you also have a lot of time on your hands. I would imagine many farmers try and express their individuality and their creativity in a multitude of ways. You can imagine different ways in which they might do it. But I haven't come across this particular outlet, this is new to me. It's unique. Chirpy's wife is sitting on nine eggs in there. We're going to breed some alarm clocks. Well done, Chirpy. Occasionally you'd see these little bantams with little... sort of... little, sort of, velvet waistcoats on! And again, it took a while to realize this was part of something that he'd set up, he was filming. I know that he did take sort of quite bizarre photographs of things... rather sort of, I don't know. bit like Monty Python, really, when you think about it! [Charles] Well there we are, these are our lovely cows on the farm. I took these pictures myself. Absolutely wonderful. And this is a cow being served. We have a lot of twin calves on this farm. Well, there you are! This seems to be a magic way of doing it. Yes, there is, of course, another way of getting triplets on a farm. Look at this. You can hardly believe it! I took this photo myself. It's so fun to watch a man that's that old be having such a good time on camera. [Davy] I see somebody with creative instincts who's not in a creative field, and art should not be the province only of people who are professional artists. [Ciaran] Much of his approach, it's a surrealist approach. The juxtaposition of images... the timeline's completely lost... the photo montage... and then the unusual things he does, the way labels everything. And he uses images, he uses cartoons, in effect, you know, all of that's very interesting. You know, the hens sitting on people's heads, all, all of that, him sitting on the back of a cow! And that could be explained as an accident, it could be explained by somebody who's consciously adopting the techniques of the surrealists, it could also be explained as an outward manifestation of what's going on in Charles' head. That his own thoughts were disconnected in some sense. He would just appear, certainly at our door, or at the front gate and present yet another tape, which he would assure you that he would come and collect in about a week or fortnight's time, expecting you to have watched all three hours of it, I have to say! And this would happen quite regularly. The cards would appear at Christmas and Easter. And if there had been some other significant event which he sort of produced a card for, you'd also get one. I can remember on one embarrassing occasion, he lent us a video, and I have to confess I hadn't watched it, or possibly not at all, but certainly not all the way through. And I clearly failed very badly when he asked me questions, to be confronted by him saying, "You haven't watched it, have you? I'll leave it with you until you have!" So I very dutifully then carried on, took it and watched all the three hours, and I was asked the same questions when he came back to pick it up the next time. But I had the answers! Charles made unique cuts of his home movie for different people in the village, and the tape that I have was one he made especially for my grandparents. [Charles] Frank, we've got Nurse Harding coming to see you. Patricia is going to do your legs today and she's got some lovely pussycats at home. And she's, she's going to retire this week. So I'm going to take a video. The footage that Charles has shot of her is the only document and the only memory I have of my grandmother. So I kind of owe Charles a debt for that. And I wonder if one of the reasons my grandfather kept the tape was because it was a way to see his wife, Trish, again. [Charles] This is Nurse Harding, the district nurse of Huish Champflower. She's come to do Frank Carson's leg. A very, very good nurse, she's going to retire next week, so I'm going to take a video. Come on then, Trish, let me take a video of you, my dear. I'm going to put a dry dressing on this, it's shallower. -You're like an Iron lady! -An Iron what?! Iron Lady. You're not a Mrs. Thatcher, but... No, I'm no politician! I reckon you're tough as old boots, Trish. -You reckon? -I reckon. -I am fairly tough, yeah. -Yeah. Right, now, here we go. The weekly decision, which sock would we like? Brown. -On both of them? -No, I want the blue one on top. -Blue one on top... -Put a rope around his - I'll be buggered if I didn't burn the other blue one trying to dry it on the fire, and it singed up. Put a rope around his neck, Trish, and pull it up tight! A hole came in the dam... a great hole came in... [Karen] It felt to me like he was presenting to the world, you know? He wasn't just talking to the people I think that he ended up giving those videos to. It felt like he was talking to me, to everybody! Although he does some very unusual things, and as we've probably seen the film footage, and certainly we have the cards, where he's taken the photographs after his mother's death... So, he does have an unusual attitude to death, but it's not a spooky attitude. There is something quite loving, and caring, and genuine about trying to get the very last I's dotted and T's crossed before she leaves the farm. Yeah. One of the first things that struck me when I watched Charles's own footage was his preoccupation not just with death, but with life. So he's preoccupied with the life cycle. So we see images of dead cats, a dead fox, of his dead father, of his dead mother, of funerals... so, his preoccupation with death, that's very prominent. But I think equally prominent is his preoccupation with life. So, we see calves being born, for example. He repeatedly comes back to the flowers, the wildflowers growing in his mother's garden that were planted 50 years earlier. He talks about those repeatedly. He gathers bunches and brings them to his mother's funeral. So, it's about the cycle of life. He wanted to capture them for posterity. He wanted everyone to know. And if he's looking into this camera and in his mind, he's kind of talking to the world, then he's saying, "Here's my mother. Here's my mother as she's aging. Here's my mother as she gets sick. And now here's my mother dead in the chair." You know, "Here's my mother getting the blessing." I mean, all of that, it's his experience. And he's basically saying, "Here's what I'm seeing, and here's what I'm going through." Charles is, is kind of showing all of us, like, you can respond to that moment... It's one of the biggest moments in your life, to lose a parent. You can respond to it any way you feel. You can do anything you choose to do, and it's OK. That, that is a powerful message. And that is a powerful legacy to leave behind. What Charles was doing with his parents, and with his pets, is no different from what human beings have been doing through most of history. It's only been the last, maybe, century-and-a-half that we've farmed out the notion of taking care of our own dead. So when, when Charles poses with his father's corpse, that would be the norm, not the exception. Nowadays, people talk about dying a good death, and it seems to be very sort of fashionable, if such a thing can be. But for him, that was very important. And I think that he seemed to consider that that was very... a matter of importance, not for himself, but also for the person concerned. So, in a way, he had had... he had a great deal of foresight, because a lot of the things that we now do now, and we talk about now, he was up for talking about 20, 30 years ago. So he was a man before his time, really. So, what I admire about Charles is that his forthright sense that, "This is life on the farm, there it is!" What he means to say is this is life for humans, and other created things that breed, they die. And you'll notice this at the farm, it's pretty clear. Crops fail. Animals die. And a farmer has to deal with those things. It's, like, way more progressive than you think, like, a man like that would be, like, I would think. Toward the end of your life, say, your 60s and your 70s, you think about life, you think about what you've done and what you haven't done. In effect, you count up everything that was good and you're proud of. But you also think the things that you wish you had done, or things you did do that you now feel guilty about. And you have to come to terms with all of that. You have to, have to weigh it up in the balance. I think it's clear that Charles spent his life trying to find any kind of audience for his work, and towards the end of his life, I don't think he thought he would ever find one. Whether he was doing it consciously or not, so many people in his life are retiring, dying... Farmers are very isolated. Often it's older men, sometimes they live on their own, and sometimes it's just the older man and his wife. So an isolated couple... Children tend to move away from home. In the past, there have been more farm laborers, and a sense of farm community working together. But now, because of modern machinery, there's less of that. So it can be a very long, isolated day, followed by another long, isolated day. Later on in life, when Charles was down on the farm and looking after his family, he started to go senile. You'd very often, you'd see him walking around and his trousers would be wide open, -with everything hanging out... -He'd walk around without his trousers on towards the end! He could be sort of volatile... or his mood could change, you know? and like I say, I could see him in Wiveliscombe, he'd come up to me and, sort of pat me on the shoulder and he wouldn't let me go, you know? And yet, I could see him here and he would, sort of, walk past me and not ignore me, but, you know, he was somewhere else. I was getting on with my job and he was getting on with his, and that was sort of understood, so... I couldn't really tell. I just put it down to a mild eccentricity, as I think did everybody else around here, they just, "That's the way Charles is." I think the main thing that changed was that we saw less of him. And very often when, perhaps, somebody suffers as he did, you might see more of him. But we didn't, we saw less of him, and I often wondered whether he had become rather reclusive. And also his main occupation, if you want to call it that, of caring for, well, possibly his father, certainly his mother, and Frank, that had gone. And this must have left a huge gap in his life. [Karen] It's just you and your mind. So when your mind begins to change, and maybe things become confusing, there would be no one there to counter that with. There would, there would be no one there that would make him realize that things were changing. It would, he would be... experiencing all of that alone, which is horrible. It's a horrible thought. That, unless he didn't realize it, and then if he was just out talking to those cows, and spending his days in very familiar territory, maybe it made it a little bit easier for him. [Derrick] I feel like he's maybe lost control of things? Like, I think his world is disintegrating around him and... documenting everything is like a coping mechanism to, like, make it feel like he's in control. By the time we arrived, he'd got so eccentric that people were tending to avoid him, to be absolutely honest with you. The production of the cards, and the filming, all seemed to cease. If it hadn't, we certainly weren't given any. So it just seems that he stopped... trying? So, he was an intelligent guy, no question about it. But we didn't see that. We saw the end, end product of, you know, when he was becoming increasingly eccentric. [Denise] What was, I guess, a shock, we'll call it a surprise, was that he had gone and we hadn't realized that he had, he had moved on and... we didn't know he'd gone. So, it was only until rumor informed us, if you like, and I don't know who did that, that he had attempted to come home and had, had tried to come back to Huish Champflower. And when I was told this, I can remember remarking, "I didn't even know he'd gone." Come on, my dear, there we are. She had two babies, Frank Carson, and myself. -Well done, girl. Well done. -[cow mooing] Here we are, let's have a look and see where we went. Coombe End Farm is just a little way up the road here. [cuts of Charles speaking] -Stan -Millie -Passed away You would never think it's dead, look. Helen died... that was a shock. There you are. I'm going home. Now, I'm on my own. Let's have a last look at you. That's deep enough, I think. [roosters crowing] Um... Umm... Uh... One of them died actually. You'd never think it's dead. [Charles laughing] On my own. That's deep enough, I think. Umm... Uh... You swine, Charles! Oh, aren't they beautiful? Goodbye. All the flowers, grown here on the farm. Oh, aren't they beautiful? -On my own... -Beautiful wildflowers... Beautiful, beautiful wildflowers. You'd never think it's dead. -Stan -Millie -Passed away [choir singing "All Things Bright and Beautiful] [Charles] Nearly come to the end of this video. [electronic jingle music] We do a lot of pictures on this farm. And let me show appreciation to Helen Carson, my wife. For all the things she did in the past... Well there you are, Helen. [electronic jingle music] And now, what you've all been waiting for. [trumpet music] You get towards the end of the tape and Charles's film is over, and all of a sudden another program shows up, that I assumed he had taped over, just some random TV program. And I kept watching... and I couldn't quite believe what I was seeing. Yes, the announcement of the winner of the "Family Affairs" United Nations photo competition! We've literally had hundreds of entries on the theme of family life. But who's going to win our grand prize? "Family Affairs" recruited a famous photographer to do the judging. And the winner is this series by Charles Carson. And I chose this as the winner because it's just funny, it's humorous, it's well put-together, and it depicts their family life, which looks like it was rather fun! Yes, a big congratulations to our winner, Charles Carson from Somerset, whose prize, a Philips Interactive CD player, will be winging its way to him shortly. And as a special bonus, his photos, alongside the Runners-Up and the best of the rest, will be on show at the Barbican art gallery during the summer. [Denise] I think his proudest moment has to be the winning of the competition judged by Koo Stark. And, you know, we were very fortunate that he decided to give us a copy of the letter, which was actually informing him that he'd won. And he was extremely proud of that. That, I think, was one of his proudest moments. When I saw his work again, when you showed me his work again, I like it! And I understand now why I did like it so much. It's cheerful, actually. I find it almost comic-book. I felt like he was inviting me to come and play with him. "Here's my life. Here's my farm. Here's my cat. Here are my parents." You know, "Come and, come and see what it's like." He literally said it! "Come and spend a day on the farm," you know? "Come and see what it's like, come and join me." He was so inviting, and really sweet. It made me feel good. I like feeling good, that's why he won! [Dimitri] We're watching it... and, oh my God! First prize, Charles! Oh, you fucking did it! And so that was a... [Lehr] We were so, I mean, I was proud of him. I was, like, so excited for him! [Dimitri] So proud of him, exactly! [Lehr] Like, not only did he, like, get the recognition that I think he was seeking, but, like, on this huge, like, national scale. I think he was using photography to express himself and to entertain. It was very entertaining. Entertain, educate and express his own life. [Charles] That's the picture that won the prize on the television. "Anyone seen My Valentine?" And my Valentine, of course, is... Helen, Helen Carson. Well, there she is. Oh, they're beautiful pictures, these, aren't they? Yes. I wake up one morning to a text from my dad, and there's a clip to a YouTube video, and the title says, "Charles Carson - Life on the Farm". and I have absolutely no idea what this is, has someone else found the tape before me? Who's put the tape online? The footage is probably better than most of what is on my copy of the tape. [Charles] Oh, my goodness! [Charles] You're going to break your neck, lad! I just can't believe this! I can't remember the exact sequence, but I think I started becoming aware of... these skeletons, these cardboard skeletons. I think that was the first thing I became aware of, seeing one sat in the seat of the tractor, of the old tractor, and it was there for some period of time during the day. I told ya. Damn good driver, this chap! He's as fit as a flea! He only weighs 2 stone... I can recommend him to anybody. Real first class tractor driver. [John] And I think then it was joined by another one on the little mower that he had built a kind of a drive, ride-on trolley behind. And they sat there, and they'd come and go. The old tractor that he had, the Massey or something, he'd just sort of put it on tick over and put it into gear and just put it on forelock, and it would just chug- "pop! pop! pop! pop! pop!" Just go around in a circle with this skeleton, sort of, taped his hands, taped to the steering wheel. And, and then become aware that he was filming it! [mower rumbling] Hey! What are you doing there?! Charles then goes on to make a short film and it has a plot to it, it has special effects to it, and you see a new level to his artistry. Yeah, and I always wonder, like, did he make this up as he was going along? Or did he like actually write a script to this? Hey! What are we going to do? This is the chap that had the accident last week on the lawnmower. This must be reincarnation, he's made a comeback! What are we going to do? And his props, you know, his little policeman's hat, helmet, you know, these things. God knows where he got them from, probably from the local jumble sale or something! [laughs] [Charles as skeleton] I've been up in Heaven. But I couldn't find nothing to do up there! And I said to the vicar, he said "Aye, that's alright, go down on the farm and cut some more grass," he said. [John] The little ride-on, the little mower that he'd built a trolley, and used to sit one in that. And again, it just, he'd put it on forward, and he'd just let it go until it hit something and turned over. I mean, you know, he did that endlessly. The work and expertise that it took to do all that voice-over, and to line all that up, and then edit it in-camera or in two VCRs, I mean, it's, like... It's not easy in 1996 or whatever, like, that's remarkable. -Yeah. -I mean... a lot of people use their time to sit and watch TV, but he was, like, making it, -which is amazing. -[Dimitri] Right. [Charles] Come here! Oh, dear me... Oh, you're a clever lad! So at this point, we've got another mystery. Who put this online? What does this person know about Charles? I'm Jake Day-Williams... uh... I was deputy editor of Camcorder User magazine... 1998 'til 2000, maybe? Can't honestly remember, but it's around that sort of time. My name's Robert Hull, and at the time, I was a staff writer on Video Camera magazine, and then later, a deputy editor on Camcorder User magazine. Camcorder User magazine was a buying guide for people who were interested in camcorders. We provided tips and tricks and techniques for how to make better home videos. The British Amateur Video Awards was just a competition that was run by the magazine. People would make their videos and send them into us at the magazine. And then, as I remember, we had a judging day. You know, we'd have maybe have like 20 videos and from that we'd whittle it down to the finalists and the eventual winners. [Charles] Yes, I hope this one works out very well for BAVA '98. One day, there was this video and a, sort of, crowd was gathering around this guy's desk and everyone was like, "You've gotta come see this! You've gotta come see this!" And it was Charles's video, which was just funny and entertaining. [Robert] I do remember watching it for the first time. Somebody came in and said, "I've had this to judge. You guys are going to have to see it!", right? I remember, sort of, like, watching... rather... sort of transfixed right from the start. ["Scotland the Brave" playing] You know, even at the end, to see a man in a kilt, sort of... performing "The Gay Gordons" or this Scottish thing, but playing it on a strimmer and then dubbing the music on afterwards, you could kind of see the funniness. You could see how, you know, how clever the joke was, and... okay, it wasn't pulled off particularly well, but, but it was still funny! Merry Christmas and a happy New Year! Now, we've all had a lovely time on the farm. But as you know, with Christmas cake and alcohol, it brings a little problem. And that is we all put a little bit of weight on. Now, it's no problem on the farm. Let me show you how to get rid of it. Very, very simple. The faster you work it, the more you lose! Well, there you are! So there you are, there's the scientific evidence! There's the proof that you can lose 2 stone, 3 stone a day by this method. It's the most memorable, I mean, I can't tell you which films won! [Charles] Chirpy! Chirpy, come down beside your wife. Come on! The owl will look after the foxes. The owl will watch the foxes, come down here! Now then, get in there, Chirpy, and keep an eye on your wife! [Robert] And it made us laugh, and I also remember that... it was very much of a thing for me at the time, was I thought it brought a group of people who worked together, together! Little things, little mannerisms, little things he said, started becoming catchphrases to the point where we still, kind of, say things now, 20 years later. And as new people joined the company, if they were like part of our "in" crowd or whatever, they'd get shown the video and then they'd start, you know, they'd pick up on different things, as well, which sort of then brought new life into it all again. And it just sort of kept going. Oh, there we are. Coombe End Farm! We've got eleven horses on this farm, they're absolutely lovely. Here you are, my dear, little bit of hay here. Oi! That's my watch. Beautiful! [Davy] Yes, he hoped perhaps that it would reach a broader audience one day, but it also seemed like... even if it didn't, he just enjoyed making these films. Let's have a drop of brandy. Cheers! Happy New Year! [Oscar] Whatever you might think about them as pieces of art, they capture a time, and a place, and a way of life that's changed completely. People who were working on the farms, maybe weren't that interested in following in the family footsteps, you know? It was very much expected at one time. I mean, same with Charles, really, you know? He went back home to look after the family farm. You know, a lot of youngsters now, you know, don't really want to do that. They want to follow a different path. It's a way of showing what life was like at the time. It was a hard life, it was difficult. Over the years, farming has changed enormously! I believe now that there isn't a single milking herd in the parish of Wiveliscombe. So he was telling a story all the time, really, which is probably quite sad, that he wasn't able to get more involved. He probably knew, you saw, I didn't realize how technical he was, and how advanced he was. I mean, he probably was pretty clever... if only someone had realized it! A Somerset farmer could be about to become a worldwide sensation. This is the bombshell I was telling you about earlier. You're about to see the greatest video, probably, from this year. Mister Carson has become a big hit on the Internet. This is the next "Grey Gardens", I think. People across the world and online want to see Charles's stuff. This one actually comes from England, and we don't have any videos from the U.K. at all! We were shown this footage at a show in Milwaukee with very little context, and we got hooked immediately, like, we got obsessed with it, we were watching it constantly... And we do a weekly web show, where we watch VHS tapes. Weird, disturbing, hilarious stuff. -Come on, my dear, there we are! -Listen to the sound! -Listen to the sound! -[liquids gushing] -There we are! -[Joe laughs] Come on, there we are, my dear! You're going to make that your ringtone... We should, I'm going to rewind that... I don't know how I can top a cow's afterbirth being held up. This was the 2019 Found Footage Festival clip of the year! He clearly had a real, a kind of artistic drive to bring people into his world, and to introduce them into that world. One of his captions, it said something like "self-taken photograph" or something. He's invented the idea of the selfie, unwittingly. God knows what he would make of... with the internet, I mean, he probably would have really embraced that. He'd be pinging stuff all over the place, you know? You like a person who wants to connect like that. He's clearly reaching out. It's really charming. I think he had his version of what he probably thought a following would be, if he, if he garnered one. It felt like I was watching a home movie that I grew up with, with the exception of the accents. I mean, and the multiple corpses. I don't think my family would really show that. I think it says something about Charles's filmmaking - I mean, these movies are 30 years old, they're British, and now they're actually finding an audience in the United States. It proves that there's something universal to these. That left me rather speechless. Oh, well, my dears, I've got to go now. [Jake] When I first saw the footage, I was, you know, selfish and young, and didn't have a care in the world. And now, I look back on it as a father, and as a husband, and as someone who's got relatives who are old and who have died and it... it becomes so much more heartbreaking and powerful, some of the footage. Because, in my mind then, he was like a caricature that you could almost laugh at. But now, there's a humanity and there's a sense of emotion that's really raw and really quite powerful and... I don't know, I have a new perspective on it, and a new perspective on him. Come around and have a look. I've got something to show you. [Davy] I think if he knew now that people all over the world are watching this film, people are obsessed with this film, they're talking about it with their friends, they're, they're moved by it in the ways that he may have hoped that it might move people, like, I think he would just be honored. I think he would be... I think he would feel satisfied. And I think, you know, that that artist's urge to kind of communicate your deepest self to another person, he would feel like he'd actually accomplished that against all odds. [Nick] I think he would be absolutely pleased to know that, posthumously, people are appreciating his work, you know? It's like a... I don't know, like a Van Gogh, who maybe, you know, wasn't appreciated in his time, but is now finding a new audience. [laughs] I don't know, I think... I don't know, how would somebody like... how would somebody, like what he's doing, react to popularity? I don't think like the trappings of success are necessarily the same in everyone's minds. I presume his were a bit more humble. This is how it plays the music, innit lovely? There we are. Fantastic machine, plays all the lovely farm music! See you! Charles's films make us feel more alive, and more human, and more in touch with our species, because we see how it works. Bits of it make me really kind of sad about him, and bits of it, sort of, make me feel... fill me with joy. -He leaves you wanting more! -He leaves you wanting more, -which is really what a filmmaker should... -Always a success! All filmmakers should aspire to that. These two skeletons are going to have a race on these lawnmowers, cutting grass. Should be very, very good! I'm grateful to Charles for recording his life and the elements of his life that he wanted to share with us, and I think that we can learn from that. I think that there's more to this video than just... Charles being funny on the farm. His view of death is the big takeaway here. And I think that if everybody else, like, kind of, had that view of death, the world would be a better place. I think he would be very proud to, to feel that people were recognizing that he was doing something that wasn't just a mad aberration of some bonkers farmer in the middle of nowhere, that he was making something creative and that there were people all over the world, from all sorts of walks of life, seeing what he's doing and being really astonished by it, on lots of different levels! Absolutely life-affirming. -Yeah. -And death-affirming. [all] Yeah! There you are! [John] I think it's really important, really important, that people like Charles are celebrated. Because it brings color and flavor to our life. He'll go down in history. [Charles] Yes, well, there we are. I hope you've enjoyed this video, "Life On The Farm". I take hundreds of pictures on this farm and lots of videos. Well, there we are. Now then, if you smile at me, I'll take your picture as well. -Here we go then. -[camera clicks] That's one. Smile again, and let the chicken have a look at you. -Here we go then. -[camera clicks] There you are, that's another one. There you are, that's my camera on a tripod. That's how I take the pictures. Anyway, there we are. All the best from Coombe End Farm. See you sometime. [upbeat symphony music] [upbeat music continues] [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music playing]
