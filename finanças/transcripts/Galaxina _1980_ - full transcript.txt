Captioning made possible by lions gate entertainment Man: Infinity log, galaxy date 3008.1. Captain Cornelius butt, entry number 1736. Ohh. We are now on the last leg of our 7-year mission. We're en route to traffic station number 28, where we are to police the transgalactic corridor. Joy and yummies. "The infinity" is on auto-control with galaxina, prime grade robot class number 11, on the bridge. All traffic sensors are on operational red alert. All primary ship's functions are operational green. The crew, if you can call them that, is on its 72-hour rest period. This is captain Cornelius butt. That's enough. [Woman singing opera] 45...44... 46... 45...46... [Singing opera] 47...48... 49... 49...47...43...40... [Applause and cheering] Announcer: That was the united galactic network's special program live from uranus. Dame Catherine Wilson sings "selva opaca" from "William tell," by rosini. We will continue with our regular prog-- 46... Ahh...46... 47... 48... 54... 55... 55...56. 49...47... 45...48... 49... 50... 50... 49...46... 49... 47... 49... 49...48... 49... 50... 44... 50... Hey, sarge? It's an unknown. Can I turn on the lights and siren? Sarge, please. 55. It won't do you any good. What won't do me any good? Asshole, don't you know that in space, nobody can hear your siren? Oh. Go ahead. Contact the ship. Ask them where they're from. Good idea. I know. This is private Robert "buzz" McHenry of the space police cruiser "infinity" contacting the unknown ship. Please respond. 49... Hey, please respond! This is a space police cruiser! 45... 40... [Echoing] I am ordric from the planet mordric in the galaxy of chockpun. I am on a peaceful mission to the planet altair-1. May I ask the nature of your mission? No, you may not. Oh. Hey, hold on a minute, will you? Hey, wait a minute! Well, what are we gonna do now? Well, not much. We can't risk starting an intergalactic war, can we? Heh. Why don't you go ahead... Contact the captain, huh? One captain coming right up. ["Thus spake zarathustra" playing] Butt, voice-over: Infinity log, galaxy date 3008.15, captain Cornelius butt, entry number 1737. We are in our second cycle of traffic control. I don't mind saying things have been pretty damn slow. Anyway, I've just been summoned to the bridge by that illiterate space cowboy. Wonder what he wants. Probably wants me to change his diaper. However, there is always the possibility that this call will lead to one of the most exciting adventures of my or anyone else's career. Maybe it'll be a mission that will even change the course of history, and I will be the leader. Ha ha! The name of Cornelius butt will go down in history. You just wait and see. That's it. End of entry. What's on your mind, if you'll forgive the overstatement? We have an unknown, sir, who refuses to state the nature of his mission. I am captain Cornelius butt. This is the space police cruiser "infinity." I demand to know the nature of your mission. [Echoing] My mission is secret. Where secrecy begins, trouble soon follows. The heart of all trouble is the human heart. I'm not going to engage in a battle of wits with you. I never attack anyone who's unarmed. As you wish. Prepare for evasive action. Follow him. Engage the power field. Can I put on the red light, captain? You know, kid, you got a bad habit. You breathe. [Chuckles] Butt: Steady. Steady. Ok. Now hit him! Yeah! That's it. Keep cool! Hit him! And fire! Again. Too soon. Now! How's our power field? It's ok. It's a strange kind of warfare. Not like the old days, eh, captain? Now it all depends on whose power field breaks up first. And then it's pow! [Chuckle] Too damn technical for me. [Sigh] She's a good ship, but she's an old one. Pow! How's the field holding up? It's beginning to weaken. Power. Check galaxina. See if we can spare it. Right. [Alarm blaring] He's gonna finish US off. I want to tell you guys that it's been a pleasure serving with you. Shut up, you earth-colony nitwit. He's not gonna finish US off. He just wanted to stun US, put US out of commission for a while. Son of a bitch, if we have to die, does it have to be with that stinking cigar smoke? We're not gonna die. He's right. He can't risk starting an intergalactic war. If you're right, sergeant, when we get back, I'm gonna buy you some decent-smelling cigars. Of course he's right, you nitwit. Good. Now, buzz, you go on down to the power tunnel, see how those guys are doing. I'm gonna go feed the prisoner. [Chuckling] Go ahead now. Whoops. I thought you were going down to the power tunnel. Why can't I ever get to feed the prisoner? Come here. You are not supposed to ask why. Why not? Because it's a goddamn order! Now do it. Yes, sir. Hi, doll. [Flushing] Rockeater? How you doing, furball? Your visit has climaxed an already dull day, asshole. Did you hear the one... Guy who runs up the insane asylum? He asks the guard if any crazy aliens have escaped. The guard says, "no. Why?" And the guy says, "well, somebody ran off with my wife." Ha ha ha! What did I do to deserve this? Ha ha ha. [Laughing] Ooh. [Wheeze] Rockeater: What's the matter? Can't you get your crew to listen to your jokes? You got to come down here and torment me? You don't think I have enough problems? Shit! Boy, what a guy's got to go through just for a meal. Have a hearty appetite, my friend. Rockeater. Huh? Rocks! Oh, am I hungry. Say "ahh." Shit! Unh! Ow! Smile, smile. Ow! [Grunting] Is this how you get your rocks off, chief? [Muttering] Stop, already. Enough! Unh! Aah! Bon appetit. Mwah! [Grunting] Stereo! Choke on it. I really love feeding you. So much fun. Butt, voice-over: Infinity log, galaxy date 3008.17, captain Cornelius butt, entry number 1738. Nothing's new. [Buzz coughs] Hey. Hey, hey! Whoo-hoo! Hoo, hoo! Heavy shit. Oh, ho, ho! Ahh. Yeah. Where was I? Oh, yeah. How's it going? I mean, how long do you think it's gonna take to get things cooking? Shh! You screw up the force field, then you come ask US how long it'll take to fix it? Some nerve you got. Why don't you fix it yourself? You broke it playing, cowboy. Aw, come on, Maurice. I mean, I was only asking. They sent me down here to ask. And don't get so all-fired uptight. Why does everybody always pick on me? People like sea ships-- bellow loudest when in tow. What's he talking about? You asking me? I hear his damn stoned-out proverbs all day long. You can tell the powers that be that old Sam and I'll have this kettle perking by morning, sooner if you stay and help. I'll pass on the messages, Maurice. Wait. You better tell them it'll be after noon. Better to be early than late, right, Sam? He who promises too much too soon accomplishes too little too late. Right. You got it. I'll have dinner sent down. I think you'll be too busy to join US, Maurice. Oh, what's the matter? Are we not good enough for you, space honky? Ha ha ha! Man on radio: This is the united galactic radio network, presenting 30 commercial-free hours of music brought to you by Dr. Stanley booth, family dentist, specialist in human and nonhuman dentures. Be it fang or tooth, your best bet is booth. And now, back to our music. [Classical music playing] Delightful. I love this time of day. Did I tell you the one... About--about the--- about the man who ran into a restroom? Butt: He asked for a--a Turkey sandwich, and the waiter said, "do you want to eat it here or take it with you?" The man said, "both." That's really funny, sir. Whoo! Yeah. Boy, that was... Really funny, sir. It was. Ah, delightful. [Sniffs] Hmm... [Rattle] [Rattle] [Jingle] I'll take this one. Wine. It's time for the wine. I love a good wine. [Chuckles] Ahh. Belugian thunder ripple. 2001--a great year. Great. Hmm! [Cork pops] [Pouring wine] [Gargle] [Gargle] [Choking] Thank you, sergeant Thor. It was my pleasure, sir. Ooh! Shit! Buzz: Ha ha! Sergeant Thor. Ohh. They don't want you touching the merchandise, man. Why did they make her like that? Why didn't they build her out of tin stovepipes? You know that it is forbidden for space police to fraternize with machines. It's against the laws of nature. You might go blind. Gentlemen, a toast. May we be slaves to nothing... To nothing... To nothing... But... But our duty. But our duty... Our duty. And... And... That's it. Ahh. Boy! Am I stuffed. Yeah, me, too. Oh, boy, I probably won't be able to eat for another year. Oh. Where did you get that egg, McHenry? Is that an authorized egg? I found it with the rockeater's belongings. He probably stole it from somewhere. What do you think laid it, sir? Let me have it. Sure, sir. A real egg. You know, people used to eat these things. Difficult to imagine, isn't it? Oh, it sure is. I can't imagine it. In fact, the whole idea is revolting. It makes me nauseous. It turns my stomach-- enough, private. Oh. May I? You're not gonna eat it, are you, sir? Why not? I don't know. It...Makes me nauseous. It turns my stomach. I really don't think you should eat-- he's right, sir. You don't know what kind of an egg that is. You don't know where it's been or who laid it. Nonsense. If people concerned themselves with where eggs came from, they never would have eaten them. Heh heh heh! Yucch! [Gulp] Ohh. [Gurgling] Ahh. [Chuckles] Mm. [Rumbling] Mmm. [Grunting] He's choking. Well, what should I do? Hit him. I won't get in trouble for this, will I? No. Are you sure? Hit him, already! He's choking! Promise? It's an order. Ok. Then let's beat the crap out of the old bastard. Aah! Ooh! Ooh! [Gasp] [Hiccup] [Exhales] [Rumbling] Unh! Unh! [Retching] Oh, god, that was awful. Oh, that's disgusting. I told you so. Nobody ever listens to me, and usually I'm right. Don't be an "I told you so." Where the hell did you get that egg? Now, where's that monster? Is he gone? Oh, I need a drink. Ohh. Oh, you guys hit me. You hit me very hard. You did it on purpose, I know. But I'll get you. I'll get you. I'll get you. I'll get you. I'll get all of you, every-- thanks. I needed that. Heh heh heh! Here comes chow. Hey, galaxina, baby. How you doing? Will you look at that ass swing? Too bad she ain't human. Robot woman like clock-- pretty face, pretty hands, pretty movement, but hard to regulate when she get out of order. Yeah, sure, Sam. Damn wings ain't good for nothing. Can't even fly anymore. Shit. Chicken again. Want to bet they have steak upstairs? Hey! Uh! Very sorry. Damn, look at that. Hi, galaxina. I really have to talk to you for a while... If that's all right with you. I know you can't talk... But you can listen. You're very beautiful. I don't know if it's because we've been out here for so long... But I think I am starting to fall in love with you. I know that sounds crazy. After all... You're a machine, and I'm a human being.... Which is just another kind of machine, really. You're very lovely. And I've got to... I just got to kiss you. No, no. I know. I know I'll get a shock. I don't know what to do. I can't stand it. Ooh! [Gasping] [Groaning] It was worth it. Well, it's time for the holo-com. Maybe it'll be elexia this time. Hey, where's the captain? Oh, I don't know. Probably asleep in his quarters. Hey. Hi, guys. Hello, elexia. Hi, darling. How you doing? Great. How you boys doing? We're doing. What's happening? Oh, the commander wants to talk to you boys. But first I've got a little something for you. Yeah? What's that? Elexia: Well, I know what it's like for you guys up in space for so, so many years without a real woman. Galaxina's ok. But frankly, I don't know how you do it. I really don't. [Chuckles] McHenry: Is she gonna do what I think she's gonna do? So I've got a little treat for you, a little something to hold you over. Thor... Oh! That's it. Touch me. Touch me. Oh! That feels good. Oh, my... Oh... You guys are something else. Touch me. Touch me. That feels so nice, so nice. Thor... Oh! Quivering venutian blubber cups. What is going on here? I've never seen such an immoral display in my career. You call yourselves space police? If a jackass had both your brains, he'd be a very dumb jackass. And you... Your brains need a brassiere. Sir, the commander wants to speak with you. The commander? [Clears throat] Bye, guys. Bye, darling. Thank you. Captain Cornelius butt. Commander gravity. The name is garrity, sir. Let's not quibble. It must be enough that I respect and admire you. What is the meaning of this communication? Well, butt, the "infinity's" going to make a little side trip. Side trip to where? Altair-1. Altair-1? Altair-1? That's right. Thor: But, commander, it'll take 27 years to get to altair-1. I am aware of that. But, sir, my mother's gonna be a little old lady by then, sir. You knew what you were getting into when you joined up, private. And so did your mother, I assume. Would you prefer a discharge right now, private? I could arrange that. However, you would still not be able to leave the ship for 27 years. And, of course, your pay would stop immediately. Oh, no. No. No. I'll stay. Thor: Sir, do you realize we won't get back to earth for 54 years? I do. But just think of the overtime. But who's got the time? It's 0833 hours. Not that time, dummy. The 54 years. Who's got 54 years to kill? Garrity: I realize your concern, men. However, this mission is imperative. And besides, you do have your cryosleep chambers. Uh, sir, what is the nature of this mission? Well, captain, we think someone has discovered the blue star. [Dramatic music plays] The blue star? The blue star? [Dramatic music plays] The blue star. [Dramatic music plays] When you arrive on altair-1, you are to contact an earthman named frank future. He is holding a sample of the rock. He owns the only saloon in town and will be easy to find. However, need I tell you how important this mission is? This mineral has the power of the stars within it. It could revolutionize the civilized sectors of the universe. Sir, I'd like to tell you how proud the men and I are that you have chosen US. It shows great skill and tremendous foresight on your behalf that this difficult mission should be given to our-- you were the closest. Gotcha. In view of your long journey, I have authorized a 24-hour furlough on the rec station. Galaxina will receive the coordinates for altair-1. Good luck and good-bye.

Cornelius butt and his boys. I make a habit never to forget a face. But in your case, I'll make the exception. Kitty, a month away from you is like a year in cryosleep. [Laughs] I swear, oh, you old lady. You're a devil, butt. [Laughs] Whoo! I see you got some earth cola. Well, good thing, because we don't accept earth yen no more. Too unstable on the galactic market. Well, why stand here and talk? You must be all tired and horny. Oh. Come in. Come in. [Piano playing] This is good shit. It better be. It's plutonian gold. 200 earth yen an ounce. Wow! Far out. Then I dragged myself through the blistering black plutonian desert, up north through the twin pyramids, into the furry forest of love. Madam? [Snaps fingers] Thank you. Owner: All right, sheena, back to work. Well, at least you're not two-faced, or you wouldn't have chosen the one you've got on. Ha ha! Come on. Hey, buzz! Hey! Come on. Let's go. Kitty, kitty, kitty. All right, my dear. Next time you pass my house, I'll appreciate it. I've had a wonderful time, but it wasn't tonight.

[Engines cranking] [Engine backfires] Butt: "Infinity" log, galaxy date--3008.2. Captain Cornelius butt. Entry number 1739. Well, today we set course for altair-1. We will enter our cryosleep chambers for the 27-year journey. Aww. It's too bad the "infinity's" an older ship without hyperdrive. Hyperdrive is neat. You see all those colors and lines. Hoo hoo! Ha ha! All the new ships have hyperdrive, but hyperdrive would make the trip pretty quick. Yeah, well, you take what you can get. Anyway, galaxina's in control of the ship. We never did find that ugly little monster from the egg. Well, got to go. Wonder what happened to that little shit monster. Ech! Makes me crawl. [High-pitched chattering] [Beep] [Beep] [Beep] [Beep] [Whooshing] Hmm... [Yawns] Girl: Grandma, can you open this jar of pickles for me? I'm sorry, dear. It's my arthritis. I can't open that jar of pickles for you. Girl: Oh, grandma. What more can I say? [Computer beeping] No. You needn't tell US anymore, grandma. We all know what pain is, don't we? Well, now arthritis pain can be gone forever with Johnson's new atomic-powered magnesium claws. That's right. With Johnson's new atomic-powered magnesium claws, arthritis pain will be gone forever. We guarantee it. Grandma, can you open this jar of pickles for me? Sure, kid. Why not? Oh, grandma! Mommy! [Laughing] That's right. With the Johnson's new atomic-powered magnesium claws, your arthritis pain will be gone forever. End arthritis pain and have super strength. For more information, please write... [Deep computer voice] I love you, sergeant Thor. [Voice changing pitches] I love you. I am better than a human woman. I am warm. I have adjusted my temperature. Hi, galaxina. Hey! Boy, am I hungry. Me, too. What year is it? 3035. I got 3033. This thing's slow. Hey, brother, did we just earn some overtime or did we? I'm gonna retire. Ha ha! A rich fool... Is just like poor oil painting-- richly framed... Hey, hey, hey! How you doing, Sam? Oh, my god. He looks like rip Van winkle. Life just one damn thing after another. Let me help you out, sir. I'd like to help you out. Where'd you come in? Ha ha ha! Suit yourself, sir. Where'd he go? Where's the captain? Where's the bathroom? Butt: It's not down here. 95... 96... 97... 98... 104. Ha ha. 99. 100. 101. 102. 103. 104. 105. 106. 107. You startled me. Shock? There was no shock. I've reprogrammed my shocking mechanism. You... Can't...talk. You're not programmed to talk. I am now. I've done it myself. I had 27 years to work on it. And I've done it for you. I love you, sergeant Thor. You're not cold anymore. You're warm... And soft... [Chuckles softly] Like a human woman. I've adjusted my temperature. I'm better than a human woman. Do you like my voice? Oh, yes. Very much. I can change it if you wish it, sergeant Thor. No, please don't. And... Just call me Thor. Very well, Thor. Your every wish is my command. I'll see you later. Oh, shit. I wonder if she's got a... Thor: Whoever built her sure forgot something. [Screeching noises] [Low mechanical hum] [Screeching noises] I'll get you now. I'll get you now. [Laughing evilly] [Alarm blaring] Oh, whiplash. [All shouting] Whiplash! I'm gonna sue. I sure hope the space police is insured. Oh! Whiplash! I'm gonna be rich. Whiplash? Short arm inspection. What is this, Philadelphia? Ooh, my aching wings. Man who get whiplash get rich quick. Uh-huh. Thor: You must go to the town and find frank future I'm sorry you'll have to go it alone, galaxina. We know you can do it. Whiplash requires care. Another thing, galaxina-- due to an excessive amount of infrared rays on the planet, the atmosphere is very strange. When the sun is up, every color changes. In daylight, the blue star will be red. At night, it returns to normal. [Chirping] Altair-1 is entirely inhabited by the scum of the universe, settled by earthmen over 500 years ago as a penal colony. So, please, be careful. [Grunting] [Jazzy music playing within] [Grunting] Hey, freak, pay two. [Speaking indistinctly] [Gasps] [All laughing] Are you frank future? Name's Mr. Spot. Frank future. Let me see now. Frank future. Oh, yes, I remember him. Oh, you do? Yes, he was delicious. Delicious? [Growling] I believe he was roasted or... Oh! Maybe poached. I'm sorry. I can't seem to remember. What'll you have? Oh! How about a cool drink? Perhaps a blood shake or a plasma cooler with some chilled lady fingers on the side? Oh! [Laughter] Oh, you're all disgusting. Now, now, my pretty robot. Don't you know robots do not have emotions? You're beginning to act human. I'd like to see frank future's room if I can. Why not? Upstairs, second door on the right. Are you sure you wouldn't like a drink? Oh! [Laughing evilly] Throw the weapon on the bed. [Laughing] You must be galaxina. I've heard a great deal about you. So we meet at last, ordric from mordric. You are very beautiful for an automaton. And what about you, baby? Take off your mask and let me see your face. This is my face. [Laughing] Oh, sorry. That's all right. I presume you are looking for the blue star. [Dramatic music playing] Ordric: What's that? Who's here? The blue star. [Dramatic music playing] Ordric: What is this shit? It is mine. With it, I will control the universe. Oh, it's Beau-- leave it alone. But I want to touch it. However, if you fear me... What are you doing? A mere earth creation... Keep away. I'll understand. Touch it if you will. Ordric does not know fear. Oh, but I must hold it. Hold it if it will give you satisfaction. What are you doing? Stop turning around. Let's go for coffee. [Electronic beeping] Please, stop. Oh, my aching gyros. Are you getting dizzy, ordric? Thank you very much. Oh, shit. The blue star-- [dramatic music playing] Is mine. Get stuffed. [Horses whinnying] Oh! [Crash] [Groaning] Hey, cool it, man. She can take care of herself. And besides, even if she can't, we can always requisition another machine. She's not just a machine, bat boy. Come on, Thor, dad gum it! She's just a damn machine! Oh, that's better. Once a machine, always a machine. Hey, just kidding, man, just kidding! What's a machine? Let's send out for pizza, huh? You're deserting me, too, huh, buzz? It's not just a machine. I mean... She's not a machine. Get sausage. I'm gonna go find her. Extra cheese. Anybody coming with me? Butt: Italian sausage. Double-thick crust. You're out of your gourd, man! Always been a sucker when it comes to love. Butt: Buzz, no anchovies. Sam: Imagination. Leave it to young man to compensate him for what he is-- Sam, will you shut the fuck up? [Lively dance music playing] [Weird burp] [Music fades out] I stand before the great god Harley-Davidson. Oh, Harley-Davidson, our lord and master, our graven image, please protect US. Vroom, vroom. Our ancestors were the first outlaws that were sent to altair-1, earth motorcycle gangs. Now we, their descendants, will rule the universe. In my hands, I hold the blue star... [Doo-wop music playing] The key to great wealth. And when the sun rises in the west, this sinner... Sinner! Sinner! Will be sacrificed to the great hog in the sky-- Harley-Davidson. O, Harley-Davidson, our lord and master, our graven image. Please protect US. Vroom! Vroom! [Burps] Our time.... Has come. With the blue star... [Doo-wop music playing] I, chopper, will be able to rule this planet. Shit. I'll be able to rule the whole fucking universe. [Laughing sinisterly] McHenry: Oh, I tell you, I sure am hungry. Who would have ever thought we'd find a human restaurant in an old hick town like this? Oh, crud. This is not exactly our kind of human restaurant, is it? No. I really wasn't even hungry anymore anyway. Come on. Hey, buddy, what do you want for the jukebox? Hey, look at that thing. That's a beautiful jukebox. It's worth a fortune. It's an antique. [Heavy footsteps] Oh, shit. [Loud growling] [Heavy sigh] [Dramatic music plays on soundtrack] Bunny fluff. "Bunny fluff"? Ha ha ha! Bunny fluff! You shut up. Turn the key. And kick this. [Engine starts] ["William tell overture" playing on soundtrack] [Horses neighing] They've stolen our lord. This--this is impossible. Quick! To the horses. Get on them, men! Wait. Don't shoot. You may hit the lord. Can't this thing go any faster? Here we go. I don't think they want to hit the lord. Ha ha ha! Yee-ha! Whoo-hoo! [Engine sputtering] I guess we're out of fuel. Here. Throw it. Hey, Thor, is it over now? Let's go! Oh, jeez. Come on! O, Harley-Davidson, please protect US. Vroom! We forgot the pizza. Ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ordric: Thank you for delivering the blue star... [Dramatic music plays] To me. I thought I destroyed you. I have an excellent mechanic. But let US not waste any time. Captain... Set a course for my planet, mordric. Mordric. That's a suburb outside of Philadelphia. Or is it Pittsburgh? Anyhow, they make good pizza. Ordric: Go up to uranus and turn left. Right. Left. Right. No. Left. Oh, you're crazy. Can't turn left and right. Come on. Eat the bars. Nice bars. Come on, now. Eat the bars. Thor: The bars! Eat the bars! I don't eat bars. I'm a rock-eater. Rock-eaters don't eat bars. Bar-eaters eat bars. Rock-eaters eat rocks. That's how we get our rocks off, asshole. Why don't you go play in the black hole? McHenry: Thor, come on! Hyah! Thor, he shouldn't be a prisoner anyway. He's too sweet. Come on. Poor... I think you're sweet, too, baby. You want to see my etchings? Please, you're just another pebble on beach. Who needs this shit? ...grew a little Boulder. Give me a break. After all, he did eat the queen's jewels. Well, maybe he was hungry. You're beginning to talk like a human, baby. You better cool it. He's a criminal. He ate the queen's jewels. Do you have a drinking problem? If you do, then call happy hour spirits, the liquor store chain that's there to serve you. Now, we have stores all over the galaxy. That's happy hour spirits. We're there when you need US most. Announcer on TV: And now back to our ancient movie of the week, the 20th-century's "first spaceship on Venus"... Man on TV: Look at those bubbles. It could be a kind of organic life. [Eruption continues on TV] Man on TV: Omiguro, stop. Omiguro: It's coming after US. Look! Up the ramp! It's gonna go quick! Aah! Aah! Man: Sumiko, I'm coming! [Snoring] If only you had a you-know-what. Oh, I forgot to tell you, I checked the catalog, and they offer you-know-whats as an option. Really? Yes. Then it can work. It comes with a guarantee. Who's there? Who is it? A marriage of man and machine. Oh, Thor. Galaxina. What's the matter? Children. We can't have children. Yes, we can. They're in the catalog, too. Oh, galaxina. Oh, Thor. I must be hearing things. Uh-huh. [Woman screaming on TV] Don't panic, sumiko. We'll find a way out. What's going on? Don't shoot, John, don't shoot! Well, what do you know? [Kiss] [Grunting] [Spitting] Yuck! Buzz: Maybe it thinks you're its mother. You are, in a way. Yuck. Shut your mouths. Who kisses his mother like that? [Spluttering and spitting] Mama! Mama! Can't wait till we get the blue star. Blue star! [Dramatic music playing] ...back to earth for testing. We're all gonna be rich! And there's plenty more where that came from. Galaxina: Well, that's good. We're gonna need it. Sonny! Attack! Not me!
