And with his participation hundreds of civilians were killed, as well as the youth Stavrovskoe underground. So? - I approve. - On what basis? - Based... visual memory! - We have 72 hours with you, to confirm or deny your allegations. - And then what if there is not enough time to confirm? - And then you know better than me. You worked in the authorities. - I made inquiries. - Why did you quit? - What time is it now? - Five to nine. - Now the time is running! And you spend it on me! - So, you claim what... - Yes, you yourself you say there is no time! You still recite the Old Testament to me! Flies will die of boredom in flight. Your time is down the drain! I caught a traitor! I ran after him for 10 years! 10! - Quiet! I hate it when they scream. According to his passport, he is Bykov Alexander Ivanovich. - You check this passport. At any bazaar, you get any Freemason for 7-8 hundreds of minced meat will draw this! He is the executioner, Major. Executioner! Any dog ​​knows him in Stavrov. And those who remained alive remember! - Did you meet with Bykov during the war? - I... ...

Vanya, dear... - Go! - And where does this come from do you have a bourgeois organ? - I traded it with a German. I give him a poultry house did, and he gave me this thing. - It is clear, I was in captivity. So a spy. - Why are you breaching? You are not the boss to face it! - What is that? - Evidence of espionage in favour of German intelligence during the imperialist war. - I'm asking about the gramophone! What's this? - Oh, this? Well... they won't get poorer. - "So" - said the poor man, cried and left? - Set aside, Safronov. Once and forever! - That's all they found. And the sabres there is no silver one about which the signal was. - There was no sabre. I had trophy, in the 18th year I sold. And the sabre is steel, do you understand? Her head will be flogged, and the silver will become blunt, do you understand ? I work day and night, you come and take everything away! I'm working hard again! .. - Let's go. - Okay to whine you, enough! I am a serviceman, I was ordered to do it! Here it is written: he was conducting religious propaganda! - Yes, what! .. Listen to me! I taught children to pray that the name of Christ did not forget! I did it at home! My home is my castle! I have a right! - And then your children will carry your father's teaching? And where is the silver? - I didn't think that someday I would say these words to someone. I'll tell you, bastard. - Quiet, quiet. - I curse you. Your whole race is filthy, your seed is rotten.

And I'm your priest's I don't listen to nonsense. - Yes, I love you! .. - Help. - You will answer! And in the next world you will answer, you bastard! And you will answer to this! Do you hear, Kalenov? - Hands! - Close. - You mean that 20 years ago you caught a glimpse of a boy, almost a teenager who is now suspected of being a war criminal? Have you met him yet? - Yes. Stavrovo is a small town; sometime somebody sees everyone. And this was a very inconspicuous jerk! I didn't pay attention to him at all. - And during the war? - I... commanded a partisan detachment. And this... bitch became a big boss of the Fritzes. There was a kid, but a fierce one - oh! .. He put my entire cell underground. And these are children! They all studied at the same school! And this one with them! He is it, Major. I swear to God. - Do you believe in God? - Hmm... - We are preparing money for travel! - Wait. Stalinist comes secretary... - Shut up! - Money for travel! .. - Poskrebyshev? - Exactly! And he says: "Comrade Stalin, Rokossovsky's immoral lifestyle leads. Has a wife and mistress. What are we going to do? - "To envy." - Drink vodka in my carriage, right? Telling political jokes? Stalin is not on you! We must put you all against the wall! - And Comrade Khrushchev allowed us everything. Your wall is over. - And Khrushchev will pay for travel too? Prepare the money! - In stuck! - Do two! Do three! Do four! Do five! Do six! Do seven! - What is this, Mitka Pronin? - Yes, he is already in his first year. - Do eight! - How matured! - Allow me? - Girls, well done! We scattered. - Guys, wait.

Comrade Kalenov. Let's welcome him! Please, Boris Andreevich. - Thank you. Guys, it's not a secret for any of you that our country is surrounded by a ring capitalist states. The imperialists don't sleep but we, as they say, are not asleep. And recently, the Red Army has significant advances in military training. - I have a question. - Shvetsov, sit down. - Well, let the kid say. - Can? - Sure. - Come on! - Comrade captain, we have reduced the number of hours for military preparation. Why don't you know? - Maybe they taught better? - And how can you become a real Voroshilov shooter, if the shooting conditions are easier than last year? - What a terrible you have! - Such. - And the rate of cartridges has become less. How can young guys learn to shoot? - Well, have you learned? - I learned. And the guys with a class younger are already smearing. - That's a shooter, eh! But we must take into account that we have remarkable indicators inspector firing. Or not? Guys, I want to draw your attention to the fact that while we have such caring guys and girls... we are not afraid of any enemy. Listen to yourself... - Well, Lace! - Don't call me Shoelace! - Can you behave yourself? - We can. Sorry, don't be offended. - Sure! - Be ready to fight for the cause of Lenin and Stalin! Always ready! - Well, hurray, or what? Hurray! - Comrade, comrade! Comrade, what's the matter with you? - Where are we? - We have already arrived at the depot. Come out, get up! - Thy mother, elit power! - Let’s be more fun, otherwise we will take pictures all day. - Maybe we are together later? - Even though you behave normally! Elizaveta Petrovna... Everyone, guys, everyone is smiling and looking into the lens. - Mitya! Come to us. - Come on guys! - We all smile! A bird will fly out now! - Managed! - Come to my house, bring a toothbrush, powder, two clean shirts. Found in the top drawer of the dresser. And quickly. - Good. - We are here for a long time. Alexander Ivanovich, do you understand why you are here? - Sure! Some madman stuck to me at the station went to physics, broke glasses... Broken nose. - For the next 72 hours, you are considered detained on suspicion in cooperation with the enemy in the occupied territory. - How? I wonder... - If it turns out that you are not involved to atrocious crimes, you will be immediately released. Yes, I apologise in advance for the inconvenience. - I warn you in advance, I will not say thank you. By the way, I was going to the sanatorium. - Yes, the sanatorium is good. Stavrovo. - What? - The city of Stavrovo. Have you been to it? - Listen, Citizen Comrade Major, in fact... not 37 years in the yard to grab people in broad daylight without trial, without investigation. - I explained to you you are still only a detainee. So what about the city of Stavrov? Have you ever been? - Not. Where is it? - Chaps, don't run. Nikolai Vasilievich, have you brought the paint? - Yes, I brought it to the warehouse. - Well. Shura, where is Tonya? - I do not know. - Oh, he always doesn't know... Chaps, come here. Boris Andreevich, my favourite issue. Students are handsome technical institute. - Hello. Boris Kalenov. - Yegor Belov. - Wow! Boris. - Pronin! - Do we know each other? - Don't you remember? "So...", - said the poor man, cried and left. You took my father away. - Are you the son of Ivan Sergeevich? - Come on, I'll show you the school. We started such a repair, just... I need your opinion. - Let's go. - Don't pay attention. You know, young, impudent. I am so grateful to you for coming. Our guys are good. Both athletic and active. - Especially the one at the stadium. - And Shvetsov, he is - everything around him is seething. - Hello! Elizaveta Petrovna stop by for five minutes. - I'll drop by. I will take the guest to the classes and drop by. - Thank you. - Yes, you are not mistaken. - This is a former priest. - And an excellent bookkeeper. And the fact that he was a priest, so what? - Elizaveta Petrovna, I have nothing against it, let a person work. - Yes? - Sure. - Be careful, we have repairs going on here after all. You do not hold any grudge against Pronin. You know, after that story with his father, he could not get along at school, so he became impudent. - What about this shooter? - Vasiliy? - Vasiliy. - Great hopes for this kid. Hot but fair. Such, you know, clean. Oh! Shvetsov! Boris Andreevich, sorry. - Are you alone here? Where is Samsonov? Where is everyone? Who will make the wall newspaper? - Samsonov takes photos. Who else did you ask about? - Where is Shvetsov? - Let's go to? - He promised to bring the guys. Shvetsov, where are you? Shvetsov! - Here we. - Where are you walking? Where is everyone? Where is Zina? - Here am I. - Good. You will write the wall newspaper. - Why me? Like what - at once Stupina. - Zinochka, because you have the most beautiful handwriting at school. Tilt to the left. And I don’t have to ask this question any more. Shurochka, you can go you have already finished school. - No, I’m with all my people. - Well, it’s like that with everyone. - To the right, closer to the wall. - Lieutenant, what is your name? - Vorobyov Vyacheslav. - Tell me, your boss, how is she? Fine? Nothing? - A great. - Won't miss anything? - What do you allow yourself! You have been called - wait. - All, do not boil. She's just calm. - Move away from the doors. - Well yes. Vera Yurievna! - Ah? What? What happened? I had such a good dream. - There yesterday's witness asks you. - Oh, let him wait. I will go to the experts to compare the photographs of Bykov with this Pronin, on the way, we'll talk to this old organ grinder. - Major, wait. Wait a minute. I don’t know what’s in your case, but I personally collected it. There are few witnesses left. Here is a list - only six people, and the rest he killed. Take it. - Answer me a simple question if you can. As one man could destroy such a strong and trained organisation? - Oh you... you armchair worm. He was not alone! There were enough of them, traitors! Why are you here... - Have you calmed down? Continue. - We also had mistakes, but only you with your papers in your office do not understand. You're sitting there! .. - We'll figure it out. - Major, he was worse than a beast. - If you try again press on the investigation, you will find yourself in a cell. We are on duty here and we operate under protocol. By the way, you were a witness in the murder case of Stavrov's underground. - The witness is the one who saw. And I am the one who is to blame. - Samsonov, don't walk across the field. - I'm trying for you. - Let's pass! Throw-throw! - And further! - Nothing, nothing. - Come on, our ball. - Yes! - What are you doing? - Who do you think Shura likes more - Vaska or Mitenka? - Mitka has matured, right? With charm guy. Shvetsov is good, of course, but he is small. - Nothing small, just for a year younger than me. - You are already a student, and he is still a year old to study at school. - Finish, where to go. - Indeed. - Mitka is sullen. - This is because Shurochka does not notice, but now how he looks - so the mouth will be from ear to ear. - Yah you! - Guys, stand up more nimbly and more tightly. And we all smile. - Samson, okay? - Well. Ready? - Yes. - We smile. Sergey Sergeevich, can I? - Yes. - Thank you. Father... - Tell me, do you know these people? - To be honest, I'm not going to cooperate with you. I will not write a denunciation and I will not knock. Plant right away if you want. - You, in my opinion, don't understand where did you end up. It's your job? - Yes, I took these photos. Where did you get them from? - Could you recognise this person? - Pronin. With closed eyes. - Well, why, with closed ones it is not necessary. Enter! - Forward. - Sit down. - A confrontation of the citizen Bykov Alexander Ivanovich is being held and Samsonov Timofey Ivanovich. 19 September 1956. - Raise your face. - You are welcome. - Okay, Mitya, we'll win back. - Shura! Shur! Shura! Go here! - Well done! - Thank you. Listen, can we go to the dance tonight? - Mitya, let's go next time with everyone, and now I just with the chaps... - Shura, maybe let's go already? - Oh, with this little thing. - Know how to lose. - Hey, Shvetsov, do not worry, tomorrow I will win back. - If it's the same as today, I don't mind. - You cho! - Cho? - You cho! - Vasya, Mitya! - Ah? - Cho? - Well, guys, we have gone. - Holy Father or whatever, do not meddle. - You moron, he is not a holy father, there are no holy fathers in Orthodoxy. - Religion is opium for the people. Did not know? - Pray to your Lenin. - Don't touch Lenin! - Stop! But what is it! Stop! - What is it! What are you! - Mitya, calm down, everyone! - Quiet! Quietly quiet. - I... I'm not sure. This one looks like Mitka. On Pronina. But I'm not sure. - Everything? Fizkult - hello! The mistake came out, Citizen Major. It's time for you to let me go. You know, my ticket is on fire. - Take away. Another 58 hours. - Hello! God knows who ordered the intercity here. - Come on, I ordered it. - Borya, come on already! - Yes! Yes, girl, I ordered. Yes. - Great, Borya. - Klavonka, it's me, Borya. Klava, come! Klava... - Borya, listen, we discussed everything five years ago. - Klava, this is not a conversation about us, but about our children, Klava. - Hello, I can't hear! - Klava! - Hello! - Klava! - We are waiting on the street, on the porch! Come on, come on, let's go, let's go! - I want to beat the Germans. - Come when you grow up. By that time, your senior comrades will knock this reptile off our land. - Comrade military commissar, I want to beat the fascists. - Around and step march from here! Sit here, I'll be right there. - Mityaev! - I! Boris Andreevich! - Get away from me, leave me alone! Everyone went! - We have to evacuate these books. - Comrade Captain! - What do you want? - The military commissar, damned bureaucrat, says that I am still young to fight. But the fascist must be beaten! - Do not boil. Homeland can to protect in different ways. Did you send a lorry? - Not at all. - Get moving. - There is! - Well... - Everything, let's do it. Run to the hospital by ten o'clock today, there you will find the nurse Klavdia Semenenko. We'll talk there. - How about ten? The train is leaving. - In the evening! - You probably didn't understand... - Go away from me! Go away! - The beginning of the last century... - Everything, there is no time! - Why are books unattended ? - Why aren't you evacuating? There will be no other echelon. - People need comfort. - What? - Do you need help. Order to open a church, at least destroyed, which is on the outskirts. - I sent the car. - We will wash everything ourselves. People will come and pray for victory. Understand, now every person needs spiritual help. Many people want to be together. - Right now? Do you think what you say? Fritz is on the doorstep, and you are with the church! - But people... - Our people are Soviet. And I regard the doubt in their firmness as a betrayal. - Excuse me, I... - I don’t forgive! You will whine - arrest! - Boris Andreevich, this is Karamzin... - Get away from me! - I cannot evacuate books. Lisa, come here! - Seryog, what is it? - The mother howls. - I hear it. What happened? - Petka and Motka are going to war. - Wait. - Well, mother... Don't forget to water my flower. Mother do you hear? Sing? - Ah! - How many woollen socks can you? - Leg count. Take three, you have three legs, warrior. - Fool. - Have you gathered at the front, brothers? - Gathered. Are you not going to? You also received a summons. Let's get ready, you won't have time. - Mitya... Mitya... - Is everything clear? - What are you doing, Mitya? - Is it clear to everyone? - It's not good at all. - Not good... But I thought it's not good when my brothers go to protect the moustachioed ghoul. - Well, you can just come to the military registration and enlistment office and give your name. A person can lose the agenda. - Maybe, but this is not our story, truth? - Wait a minute. Mitenka, son, what are you up to? - What's not clear here, mother? - Well, I see - that's good. The fewer words the better. - Hey, brother, you change your mind, I ask you. - What will happen next? I do not understand. - What do not you understand? - He decided to wait for the Germans. - Mitya, tell me you were joking. Mitka! - Mitya, it's not true. - And you report me, come on. - Do not disgrace yourself, Mitya. Don't disgrace your family. - A-a... A family, you say? Tell our father about your family, only you at least find his grave first. Tell him: "I'm sorry, dad, the Bolsheviks killed you without trial, without investigation. You disappeared into the northern camps. Either from work you died, or from hunger you bloody diarrhoea went, or for the last ration of bread you some urkagan stuck under the rib. And what about us, your family, before that? We are all going to fight for the Bolsheviks. It hurts, we love them, right ? - What are you talking about? - What are you doing? - Also say: "Your son Mitka shames you, does not want to spill blood for those who spilled yours." - Don't hide behind your father! - Boys! Well... - I have not forgotten my father, hey, you moron! I'm better than you remember! - Stop immediately! Boys! Seryozha! - Do you remember how he came down this hill, how he looked goodbye, as his mother howled after him, remember? - I remember everything! If my father was alive... he would have gone to defend his homeland! - Stop it! Seryozha, come here! Enough! Enough, I told you! - Go away, Mitka, or I'll kill you! - Do not dare! Matvey, don't. - Put it first. - Hallowed be thy name, may thy kingdom come, Thy will be done... - Klava! Klava! Klava... Well, stop these decadent things, Klava! Now let's throw off Hitler - we'll live! Let's live! Do you believe me? We will get married and have children. We'll have a walk at their wedding. - If we stay alive, we will take a walk. - Klav... - There is a very good German! Borya, you can light the stove with morning newspapers in the evening! - Come on, Klava! If everyone is in his place to do what he should, then Hitler quickly throw off. And God, his soul, his mother... Come on... Come on without snot, Klava. The city will most likely have to be surrendered. And in the city it is necessary to put together an underground. - What are you? - Klav... - Who will go on call, who volunteered. Party members in the woods will give in to partisans. Borya, who will stay in the city? Old people, children, women? Are you going to beat the underground with them? - Old people, children and women! Klava, Klava... Klav... - Only you are leaving us here, Borya. - No one quits, Klava! This is a strategy. - Don't tell me those words. "Strategy"... don't. - Klava... - Vaughn, refugees from the western regions walked. They told me what the German was doing there. Every fourth in the Red Army, husband, brother, son... Who is the commissioner... And now what? Partisan? - Do not whine, Klav, do not whine. I am begging you. Klava... Klavochka... Klav... coughs - Hello. What's so early? - As agreed, Comrade Captain. - Yes? Why? .. The clock has stopped, I can't understand? You come in, come in. I will never forgive myself for this. There was such a boy... beautiful... clean. Such... And such courage is not feigned, as if glowing from within. I... in the place of the Nazis, I would define - underground or so, adapting. So then, Vasily. It will be your responsibility to collect information about the arriving enemy units of Stavrov. Armament, food, transport. All information must be transmitted to the partisans through a messenger. And we will hand over to the regular army intelligence. - Yes. Can you undermine them? - Such sabotage actions are possible, but this will be done by another Group. This requires special training. - I passed the TRP norm. And on Voroshilov's shooter... - Well done. I... I swallowed my sentiments and... I say this, on the case, they say, you stay in the city, when the Germans come, get a job. Listen, information collect. Our city is small. There is a railway station. True, we had no time to blow it up. Until the very end our echelons went from the west. Are there faithful people? - Sure. Makogon, Pritula, Leskov ... Yes, almost all of our team. - Good. - Borya... They are just children. After stubborn bloody battles, our troops were forced to leave the cities... - I... warn you again... about the risk, the inevitable risk in the work of an intelligence officer. If you fail, torture and death await you. - So I imagined it. Bolshevik Russia: chaos... and a large portrait of Stalin. - Mr. Colonel, it can be fixed. - Think, my dear. On whom lean? On people like you? But you are a traitor, from their point of view. A foolish man, as they say, is a servant of two masters. My great-grandfather served your king. Was the chief of the gendarmes. He thought he knew about Russians. I even started writing a book... "Hordes of bandits and dreamers". It was blown up by your revolutionaries. You have high spirituality side by side with hellish cruelty. This is typical for the mentally ill and psychopaths. The Deiner family has always been squeamish about people with deformities, dirty blood and dubious beliefs. And you, as it seems to me, are no exception. Yes, you are offended, young man. - No, I just don't like unnecessary words. - So, you will prove your loyalty by deed. - Do not doubt. If you shake out the Bolshevik infection from Russia, the people will be cleansed. - And if you can't shake it out? - So, scrape it out, knock it out like teeth in a fight. "You have common sense. But there is also some kind of wormhole. You are not a slave, but not a friend. You are like a wild dog. - There are many who hate the Soviets. Yegor Belov - his father was a priest. The Bolsheviks were shot. - Shoot. Shoot. - I'm sorry, Yegor. - Yes... - It will be an interesting experiment. "I cannot understand only one thing, Major. How can you become a traitor? - It is forbidden for civilians to walk outside their place of residence without a pass. It is forbidden to be outside the house after dark without a pass. All residents must register with the commandant's office. It is forbidden to accept non-local residents. About the appearance of strangers inform the headman or burgomaster. It is forbidden to come closer than a hundred metres to the railway and pass it without a pass. For hidden weapons, individual parts of weapons, cartridges and other ammunition, for any assistance to the Bolsheviks and bandits and for the inflicted damage to the German armed forces the perpetrators will be punished by death execution. - A prisoner! Stopped in! Face the wall. - Family members of the commanders of the ed Army - to the wall. Communists, as well as their relatives and friends - to the gallows. - Aim! - Heads of production institutions - for questioning in the commandant's office with things. - Vania! Scream - Commissar bastards - to work in Germany. - Get up, carrion. - All men of military age - in work battalions. Jews... to the camps. Gypsies, vagabonds - at the expense. On the slightest suspicion of being connected w h partisans - the death penalty. - No, it is not him, the chief citizen. That one had a sabre. He was a brave guy. And this one is... frail. And the old one, too. - Thank you buddy. - Take away. - Prisoner, get up! To the exit! I went straight! - What did I say, Comrade Major! - I was always sure that it would happen, but I didn't think it would. - Why didn't the communists shoot you? What is the reason for them from the priest without coming? Why aren't you at war? - I do not accept war. - War... - Yes, yes, war is the last argument of kings. But this does not make the blood of living people cranberry juice. - The German order is aimed at the restoration of genuine values. One of them is the institution of religion, trampled upon by your Bolsheviks. Consider this our gingerbread. - Yes, we've already seen the whip. - Father Sergius, do you need a church or not? Use our favour. I follow the orders of my leadership only. I also know that we need workers, and your people need work. And we all need order. New order. - Seryozha! - Hello, Father Sergius. - Did you come to help? - Yes. - Do you believe it? - I believe. - I pray for your brothers who have gone to the front. - Bless, father. - Father, what a joy! Now we will have a temple. The heart sings at this news. - Thank God. - Here's an icon. - Thank you. - Candle wax and a handkerchief to keep you warm. It's cold here. - God save us, my good ones. - Maybe I can help you with something? - Help, my son. Go put the lectern in the Center. - Wooden stand, there it is. It's such a joy! Now there is where to come. - We will collect the parish. The Lord does not leave, straight from the hands of Satan a ray of light gives us - the temple returns. Wonderful are your works, O Lord. - Such horror! Brother kills brother. - God will not leave us, mother. Well, little help. Hold it. - Come on, unfold. - Read it, my son. I haven't heard the temple of this word of God for a long time - And if anyone... who hits... and dies... - Vassenka, let me help you. And if anyone strikes and dies, let death be the result. If not though... - Wow! Yegor, look what is being done! Our Komsomolets have come. Why suddenly? Forgot his moustache idol and immediately believed in God? Ah? - Yes, I have always been interested in religion. - Do you hear, Yegor, what he says? Always interested! You can't say that. Someone, I think, recently had a short course VKP (b) bounced off the teeth. - You quickly changed your colour, Shvetsov. This still needs to be checked. - Come on, Shvetsov, "Our Father". - You are not my spiritual father. - Stay! You did not understand? Our Father, alive. - Now I am for you, Vasya, the king, god and lord. "Our Father". - Our Father, who art in heaven! Hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, like in heaven and earth. Give us this day our daily bread... - Lord have mercy! Lord have mercy! -... as if we also leave our debtors; do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. Amen. - Sit down. - I have practically nothing to tell you. I was too young and very scared. Moreover, there was such a terrible end. Now everything is fine with me, I hardly remember those years. - Good. Then at least remember the very beginning. About Vasily Shvetsov, about your sisters. - Vasya was cheerful. Very collected, thorough. Loved to laugh. It's so important for a person to be able to laugh. - It goes! - Our first task in the days of the occupation was to reproduce and paste the leaflet we received from our contact, Father Sergius. - Chaps! Where are you? - Catch him! - And you will get it! - We decided to write leaflets in block letters - you never know who will recognise our handwriting. There were a lot of hunters to serve the new regime - from someone the same Pronin put together his squad. - So, stop. First the oath. I, a citizen of the great Soviet Union, red partisan, I swear... -... that I will never betray his detachment, his commanders, commissars and fellow partisans. - I will always keep a guerrilla secret, even if it cost me my life. - I swear to always help Red Army, destroy rabid German dogs, not sparing blood and my life. - Blood for blood, death for death. I swear that I would rather die in a fierce battle with the enemy... -... than give myself, my family and the entire Soviet people into slavery insidious fascism. - If due to my weakness, cowardice or to evil will I betray this sacred guerrilla oath and betray the interests of the people... -... then let it befall me severe partisan punishment - as an enemy of the Motherland and the people. - Do you know how many traitors there were on our tiny Stavrovo? One hundred people. A hundred people had scores with the Soviet regime, and among them were our school friends. Even teachers. - Surname. Teacher's surname. - Fyodorov Silantiy Yulievich, drawing teacher. - Who's there? - Ours. This is Pronin. - I'm coming! Girls, this is Mitya Pronin! Yes? - The language came in handy. - Yes. Only I didn't teach him for that. - Oh, don't turn your nose up, intelligentsia! You are alive thanks to me. Where is Shurka? - And the girls are at home. - Let me go, Elizaveta Petrovna. Girls at home, Mitya! Girls! Wait. - Mitenka! Mit, you come in, sit down, sit down. - Both came out. - We will not leave our sister alone. - Leave us. - Go. - Mit, maybe some tea? - You're so beautiful. What are you? Are you afraid of me? - Why be afraid of you? Mit, you're drunk. Go home. - Well? Am I not the same Mitya? - Not that one. Go away. - If you then agreed to meet with me, maybe otherwise everything would have turned out. - No, Mitya, I wouldn't have turned around. You know, Captain Kalenov was right when he told us "listen to your heart." You know, Mitya, but I'm glad I listened. Who I would be now, eh? Police mat? Leave me alone! - Shurka - Shurka... You know, I have soldiers here murmuring, they need a brothel. Don't you want to try yourself as a soldier's bedding? - Do not do it, Please! - Hello. - Great. Where are you going? - To the teacher. - Let me go! - Is Shura at home? - Shvetsov! - Hello! - Hi! Have you come to study German? Come in. - No, Elizaveta Petrovna. Shura and I were supposed to meet. She did not come, I was all cold and... - How - how? Wait, I'm getting you anywhere can I see Shura? - Lord! Come on. - Shurochka! Lanyard, why didn't you come? They agreed. I am waiting for you there, behind the school, frozen. - But my mother did not let me go. Says there is very little time left until curfew. And we are not watching the time. - "So," said the poor man... Groom? See you again. - Call me Shoelace again - I will kill you. - Marry me. - I'll deal with this. - I have no doubt, dear. You know, this is natural: where there is pressure, there is resistance. Law of physics. This process must be stopped in the bud, to demonstrate that there will be no reverse. Have you learned your lesson well? - Jawohl. - Fedorov! - I! - Whose handwriting? - I don't know. - Whose tilt to the left? Remember. - But I really don't remember. - If the inclination to the left, then left-handed man? - This is only speculative. - Who was the lefty? Remember, Fedorov! You taught drawing, handwriting must remember. - Mitya, why are you poking me and call by last name? - I don't like it by last name you will respond to the camp number. - But I do not know. I'll think about it, I promise. You just don't remember right away. - Good. There are no guilty ones - we will punish the innocent. - Where is the burgomaster? Where is Mr. Colonel? - Non-Christians! Herods! Fiends! - Samsonov, here. Belov! You will shoot. Here you go. - Come on! Let's go! - Mr. Colonel, well, you are a civilized person! - The Führer's army knows no defeat! In two months we will be feasting in Moscow, and you will become subjects of great Germany, if you stay alive. Germany needs honest, loyal people - others we will destroy. - Take it off! - Give us partisans and enemies of the Reich - and you will be waiting honour and respect, your children - a happy life. Your family will not be touched by our avenging hand. - Inhumans! The killers! There is no cross on you! - Come on! - Here are the cattle. - Forgive me, Makogon. Sorry! - This is how Pronin acted: you are scared - it will be even worse... it hurts - here it hurts even more. We all stood there and thought that this could happen to each of us. And it happened to almost everyone. The neighbours saved me. They me first hid, then they took me out into the forest. And my mother went crazy when she saw Toma and Shura's bodies. I'll try to identify him. - Oh! Hello girls! How are you? I will catch up, go! But I know who has a left tilt. - Zin, do you think, will betray you? - Yes, I would have given it out long ago, if... - Where are you in such a hurry? Have you been in Moscow? - No, but we will definitely visit. - Then I invite you all. New Years I think we will celebrate exactly there. Hotel Metropol was recommended to me. I invite you all to celebrate the victory of German arms there dancing and champagne. - You will not wait for the Metropol, no champagne, nothing! - Forgive her. It... You scared us a little. - Auf Wiedersehn! - Tonya! What are you doing, huh? - Why did you speak German with him? - And what does he think we are some kind of savages? He will also have champagne, and "Metropol" somewhere in the next world! - He now knows that we speak German. Even though he pretends stupid, but he is not. And now he will be careful with us. - Fool Tonka! Well it was necessary to climb on the rampage! - Shura, what kind of abuse? You are a girl, not a seaman. - I just said she was a fool! - And I added! - And I said that this is the younger sister. And if she does something wrong... - I'm not guilty of anything at all! - And you just interrupted the elder. - Lord, why is everyone raising me? - Everything is fine? How are you? - Fine. Here Klava gave the dosage and treatment regimen. I asked Captain Kalenov say hello. Here. - Not. It seems to me... - Take a closer look. - This is Dmitry Pronin. - Lady, you are confusing me with someone. My surname is Bykov, and I was driving I'm in a sanatorium. And during the war he served as a quartermaster. - Borya... Is it really Pronin? - I'm sure. - In the name of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics under the laws of martial law, I declare you husband and wife. Here. Well, you kiss, or something. Hurray! - Congratulations. Congratulations, my children. Live happily, take care of each other. - Congratulations, friend. - Thank you. - Well, congratulations, congratulations, what are you. - Thank you very much. - Vasya, take care of your wife. - This is a gift from me personally. Hold on. - Oh, what is it? Documents? - Well, German documents. - Do you want to send us on a mission? - Well, what task? Enough, fought, we must calm down. Drive away from here, away from Pronin, somewhere south. There the children will be warm and not hungry. - What children? - Thank you. - Thank you, dad Borya. You are now like a father to us, albeit planted. - Vera Yurievna... - Huh? - There to you this again, Kalenov. Says urgent. - We are always urgent. - I told him to wait in the corridor. - No, no, let him go. - Good. Kalenov, come in. - Come on in. Come in, come in. Sit down. - Klava has arrived at my place. - Oh, congratulations. You even came to your senses a little bit, woke up. - Well, a little. She won't forgive me all these years, of course. And he will be right. I drank. You asked me which of the organs were flooded. Drank black. All the kids dreamed of me. Well... Until I drank, I was looking for him, this nit - Pronina. And then he drank again. - Yes, I understand everything, I understand. - Yes, I know you understand. I know. You have a photograph in a drawer in your desk - the children are relatives. And you are here for the third day, everything is lost. - I've been lost here all my life. - And they are already gone. - No. - Plant him, huh? Even if there is not enough evidence, plant it! Think of something, draw! And bring it to justice. - I can't, do you understand? Law is law. I can not. - And do you believe... into eternal love? - I believe. - And I believe. -... Where is this young lady that I'm in love? This street, this house, here... - What are you doing there, Bor? They haven't been with you for a long time. - Boris Andreevich! - Ah? - Here I have negatives for several years that I shot for the school wall newspaper. This is our whole life. If anything - to remember. Take it please. - Will I see him now? - You will see. - Can I call Borya? - Not now. - I don't know. So many years have passed... - A lot depends on you now, do you understand? - But you also understand: this is how you slander an innocent ... and live with it somehow. - Hello, Citizen Major. - A confrontation of the citizen Bykov Alexander Ivanovich is being held and Semenenko Klavdia Vasilievna. 20 September 1956. - Where? - On the Kudykin mountain. - What's happening? Listen... - Well, citizens are doctors... - Get up, come on! - What do we have here? Lev Aronovich, it seems... That the army did not wash away? They didn't take you. Forgotten? - Thought my medical skills more important than nationality. - Oh, yes... I see. How many more such liquids are there? Do not avert your eyes, look directly. - How dare you talk like that with a doctor? - Who is this with us? You seem to be non-partisan. And according to my information, Russian... - Young man, I have no honour to know you, but I remind you: you are in the hospital, and there are sick people. - By the way, I came to count them. Separate the sick from the wounded. Do you feel the difference? - For a doctor, there is no difference. - And for me it is essential. What is there? - Wounded in the leg, wounded in the arm. - Head wound... Of course. Or do you mean to say that this young man of military age was just returning home, stumbled, fell into a ditch and... - Stop this mess! - Get out, get out! - Take your hands off him! - Come on! - Let go! .. - But he's talking about it, Klavdia Vasilievna... - I do not know. I'm not sure. Many years have passed. Strip him. - I did not get that. - Take off his shirt. And where did you get so hooked, Dmitry Ivanovich? - It's funny, huh? I'm 20 years old, and I'm... the police chief, I call you by name... And you call me by name and patronymic. - Well... Your wound is not dangerous. But the scar will remain. So who are you? - Partisans... fired at the car. The underground works in the city. Didn't you know? Yes... - Valya, I'm ready to sew. - And what did you inject me? Your hands are cold. - Well? It is he! It! - I will wait for the expert opinion according to Bykov's document. - But this is it! .. - I will wait for the expert opinion on photo comparison. - Major, but this is it! - I'll wait! - It! - Hello. - Hello. Sorry to bother you. - Yes you! The Lord has honoured you connect us all. - Were you a liaison underground? - I helped as much as I could. - Our proud "Varyag" does not surrender to the enemy! .. - Russian partisan! .. - Police! .. Pronin! Policeman, policeman! - Shurka! .. Alive, safe? All is well? - Alive... Alive! - Are you all right, are you okay? - Yes! .. Alive! .. Alive... - Comrade Smirnov, could you identify Pronin? - I'm old already. I can identify myself. It is the sin of an innocent person to slander. Timofey, help. Maybe this will help you. The encircled units of the Red Army surrender. - It's a pity that not everyone gave up. - What? What is it, Dmitry? - Handwriting tilted to the left. - No no!.. - Old fool. - Not!.. - That's the end... - Hold on, Shura. - Say "Cord". - Cords. - Shurochka! .. Shurochka... Shurochka... Shurochka... Love me, Shura. What is it difficult for you? Well, one person loves another... - Pronin... Let her go, for Christ's sake. - He got everything. - Mit... - Love me. - You have a mother. - There is. - How are you going to look into her eyes? - Everything could be different. Mother is there. There is... Only... she doesn't love me any more. - Get up! Well? Have your fellow partisans abandoned? Ah? They always quit. Your existence is inexpedient for the party. - You lost, Mitya. Never will take yours. - Escaped? - They ran away long ago. - Stupin cheated... Well, nothing. She died anyway. And you will die like a dog. - As a person, Mitya. As a person. For friends... for the Motherland... for Shura... - We should have nailed you in the same place where your bitch gave up. They say that you can forgive all sins, voluntary and involuntary. I once believed in it. - And what do you not believe now? - You? What are you doing here? - Thank the Lord. - Yes? And what for? - For making us so different. - But for God everyone is equal. My father was... - Your father, Mitya, was a martyr. And you are a villain. Since you entered the temple... ask forgiveness from our Lord. - Forgiveness? Can this be forgiven? Ah? - Go away, Mitya. Go away. Until I took a sin on my soul. - And you take it. Kill me. - Without repentance, Mitya, only animals die. And you are worse than a beast. - So what, Comrade Pronin? I can call you that now, right? Yes... Because your documents are forged, Bykov died in a hospital in Tbilisi in November 1945 from severe wounds. A photo of our experts checked, collated and made sure that there is one and the same person, what's in 1941, what's now. I can even now ... send you to jail. With great pleasure. But there is one person who really wants to see you. Mother... - This is not my son. This is a traitor. Dmitry Pronin. - Thanks... - All right. Everything. - Comrade Major... - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Major!
