Better help and get him back. Get your men on the track before it's too late. Head him off. Oh, my God. I need your help. Hey, you're bleeding. - Come on, get up. Move it, both of you. What are you gonna do to us? Drive. Just drive. Mister? Mr. Lait? - Huh? Mr. Lait, you gotta come with me. You got to. - What's wrong? - He's dying. - Who's dying? - I don't know. He's a friend of yours. You gotta come. Hey, Jimmy. How you doing, man? Goddamn, House. What happened to you, man? Jimmy, there's blood all over the back seat. That ain't nothing where I came from. Look, just take it easy, man. We gotta do something for him. - Is the key in the car? - Yeah. He made us drive him all the way here. It took all night. Jimmy? House. Hey, I'm here, man. Can you hear me? Jimmy, is that you? Goddamn. Yeah. What happened? Who did this to you, huh? Jimmy, you and me, we came up together. You're goddamn right we did, man. House, you're my brother. But who racked you up? Jimmy, you gotta stop them. Somebody's gotta stop them. Who, House? Who are they? Man... They got a mess of us down there. Locked up. Giving them stuff. What are you talking about, House? They're gonna kill us all. You, me, everybody. Trying to find a way. Maybe they have already. - Okay, okay. - They're gonna kill us. Look, House, you gotta add it up for me. Take it easy, but you gotta lay it out for me. Grab you off the street... - Okay. ...like some stray dog. Okay. Lay a lot of shit on you, man... ...about... - But they're gonna do it, Jimmy. - Yeah, man. I seen it. - House, take it easy. - I seen it. - Take it easy. - I seen it. They found a way. Only us. Nobody else. But all of us. It's all right. Jimmy? - You there, Jimmy? - I'm here, House. I'm here... I'm here, man. I'm right here. It's all right. Look, I know they're waiting. - Listen, I don't know what to tell you. Dr. Perle, Dr. Perle. Well, listen, Jimmy's here now. Let me get back to you, all right? It was Bernie. He's at the studio. He wants to know if you wanna cancel the session or what. I don't know, baby. He's, um... He's out again, you know? I don't wanna leave him. Listen, I know you don't wanna leave him. But I can stay here and if he comes to, I can call you. I just don't know, you know? Sweetheart, it's going to be all right. Now why don't you go ahead? Yeah, I, um... I guess they'll all be standing around waiting for me, huh? That's right. Well, you call Bernie and tell him I'm on my way. Okay. Okay. Cut it. Cut it. Hey, fellas, come on, goddamn. Oh, man, goddamn. What the fuck? What did you guys do, stay out all night? - Yeah, man. - Shit, what you want? Now look, you're not looking good, and most of all, you're not sounding good. So come on, man, give me some real sound, okay? Hey, Jim, that's kind of rough. What's the matter, baby? Something bothering you? Look, man, yes, something is bothering me. I guess I'm getting on everybody's nerves, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah, man. You got that right. Thanks, Charley. - Look, baby, everything's gonna be all right. - It's okay, sure, man, it's fine. Hey, Sam. You, uh, think you can make it around the corner with everybody else this time? You got ears. I thought you were gonna let him get away with that. Ha-ha-ha. No. All right, everybody, let's try it again. Come on. From the top, Mr. Engineer. And I am coming at you. Yes. Everything is fine, Jimmy. No, he's still out like a light. So long, you dumb nigger. You know something, baby, you are perfection. Sure, I'll see you later. Oh. Bring her. Bring her. - Three o'clock in the morning. - Get your bald head out of here, brother. Hey, man. - Come on. Night, man. Great session, baby. Out of sight. Always a pleasure to have E. Rodney Jones... ...the greatest disc jockey in the world, in Los Angeles. - Any time. - Thank you, brother. No, sir, I've been on duty since 6:00 tonight... ...and I didn't see anyone go into the room except for Miss Kane. The last time I saw Miss Kane was when she walked back in... ...after making a call to Mr. Lait. - What time was that? - The hell with that. Where is she? - I don't know. I didn't see. - Well, what the hell did you see? The patient was dead and the window... Yeah, some guy stomps in here, kills my buddy, vanishes with my woman... ...and you didn't see a goddamn thing? - I'm sorry, sir. That's okay. That will be enough for now, miss. - You just take it easy, Jimmy. - Di Nisco, don't blow smoke at me. What are you doing? Are you gonna do something? I'm gonna start by asking you questions and you're gonna answer. House was your buddy. You signed him in, you're paying. Hospital chart says he was operated on for a perforated ulcer. - That's bullshit, Jimmy. - That is bullshit. - It was bullet wounds. So what? - Okay, fine. Who shot him? He didn't get around to telling me. Straight stuff? Hey, come on, Di Nisco. You think I'm gonna jive you now? - They got Wendy, man. - Who, Jimmy? If I knew that, I wouldn't be standing here talking to you. Hey, I'm warning you. Don't go this one alone. After what they did to House and Wendy, taking her away from me... ...you think I'm gonna stand around twirling my thumbs? Let the police do the police work. Don't do anything to let me come looking for you. Listen, maybe you think this is one of those shootings that you can write off. I know you don't care where the pieces fall as long as you don't have to sweat it. - Is that right? - Hey, you're asking for my help. Hey, man, I don't need your help. You just do your job. Bernie? Lait, yeah. Yeah. You're goddamn right I know she didn't go home. No, she didn't go visiting her mother either. Look, she didn't go to the flicks, she didn't go nowhere. Look, she would have never left that hospital. She said she would wait. Look, Bernie. Keep on checking for me, yeah? Yeah. Yeah, I'll keep in touch. Okay. - Who are you? - No. My name is Monroe Feather. Now, I know what you're thinking. Light as a feather, hmm? You don't know what I'm thinking. - Get over here. - Is she all you brought? Like I told you on the phone, sir, the coon got away. But you had hopes of finding him. We're on it, sir. We're on it. Mister, when you catch up to Jimmy, that's when your trouble is gonna begin. Oh, my dear lady... ...my troubles are almost over. You see, we have a scientific institution here. We seek humane solutions to social disorders. The ultimate purpose is a cleansing... ...a purification of the races on this continent... ...particularly in this great nation of ours. Mister, you are way out of date. Oh. Admirable spark, my girl. Admirable spark. Our guests are not usually so lively. Show the young lady to her accommodations. Right. Wait. Good. Good news, lads. Good news. Our missing buck has been traced to Chicago. Hold it, Jag. It's me, Lait, man. Lait? - Aha. - Goddamn you, man, that's all I need. - I mean, next time just say hello, all right? - Wanted to see if you lost your touch. Yeah, but coming up behind me, man, is a hell of a way to find out. You almost lost your jewels. I wasn't worried, brother. You know, that's what I like about you, Jimmy, your self-assurance. Just passing through right on your way from Lotus Land... Wrong, I came all the way to Chicago just to see you. Now, that's real nice. I mean, I am honored. You tore yourself away from all that money, Tinseltown, small minds, just to see me. You know something, Jagger, this is long ways from the South Side, brother. Yeah, man, about, uh, 15 minutes. What's the matter, Lait, you got your ass in a sling? Need your help, Jagger. You know, man, you come to town... ...I know there's gonna be trouble. Let's walk and talk about it. House always was a crazy son of a bitch. I mean, I'm sorry he's gone, man, but there it is. You're telling me you got your own problems. Hey, what do you want from me, man, huh? I mean in Chicago, you name it. I got a public-relations firm, a chick, a good time, whatever, man. But the rest of the world, baby, that's up to you. Traveling like old times, man, huh? Hey, come on, man. Get some good old Chicago soul food in you and everything will be cool. - Man, it just ain't my grief. Well, House said it was for all of us. No choosing allowed. What the hell is that supposed to mean, huh? I mean, House was out of his skull, didn't know what he was saying. "Gonna get all of us." Who's gonna get all of us, man? Damn, just because he got his ass shot up don't mean shit. Hey, Jagger, all the years I've known you, I ever lay any bullshit on you? Well, uh... Yeah, well that's the heavy part of it, man. They, uh... They got my woman. Wendy? Yeah. Ah, we'll never find him now. - I didn't know this was a track meet. - Oh, Jagger, shit. This is a hell of a place to stop, in front of a shooting gallery. Jagger. Now are you convinced? Shit. I wish you'd explained it like that before, man. Genocide. There are people who wouldn't understand. Genocide. The method of systematic extermination of a people. Think of the historical precedent. Oh, I fully understand your author's pride. But from a practical point of view... This little mixture of mine is as lethal as cyanide... ...and as selective as a lady buying perfume. It'll just work on the black folks? Leave the rest of us alone? You better be damn sure. Just like sickle-cell anemia, Mr. Feather. And like sickle-cell anemia... ...it will not affect people of the Caucasian race. You have my personal guarantee. - How fast does this stuff work? - Seventy-two hours at the most. It took God seven days to create the world. We can cleanse it in just three. Huh? Uh, you wanna hold it right there, uh, buddy? Mind if I take a look at your driver's license? - Mind telling me what for? - Oh, just checking. I got a right to see your license, pal. Unless, of course, you want trouble. Then I take you in and you can show it to the judge. So let's do it the easy way, huh? Yes, sir. Nice and easy. Mister Keyes. Now what kind of a first name is that, Mister? My mama wanted people to show me respect. Oh, yeah? Well, suppose you show me your registration? You got it in the car there? You know what? You're getting to be a real pain in the ass, man. Now, what's that on the floor there? Gonna set me up? Damn, that must be the meanest nigga in New York. I know what you mean. What's happening? - What's going on, brother? - Good to see you. - Jimmy and Jagger, what's happening? - You're up to your same old shit? - Right. You always did have fast feet, brother. Ha, ha. - What are you two doing here? - We'll deal with that later. We better get your ass out of here, huh? Yeah, and give them time to clean up that mess you made. Yeah. Let's see what happens. Look out! Take that side. Hey, here I am. - Hurt badly? - No. Come on, hang on to me, brother. Hey. Cool it, Keyes. He's got some information we need. Hey, man, Jim's been hurt. I gotta get him to a hospital. I'll see you at the pad. Let's go, man. Not a word. Man, I thought you were the best in the world at your thing. Maybe you just ain't mean enough. - You want to, uh, talk to him? - Me? No way, brother. That kind of game just ain't my thing. Besides, you gotta love it if you wanna do it right. And we want it done right. Right? Yeah. Right. Mister, I'd like for you to meet three of my friends. There's the Countess, the Empress and the Princess. - He the action? - Him? Ha, ha. No. He's tough, but I don't think he's that tough. Now, don't mess around, Jagger. We're hungry. Yeah, but first we gotta lay down some ground rules. Such as? Well, you gotta leave enough of him so he can answer some questions for us. Well, we can always take a break, now, can't we? Not too long. I hate to come down once I get up. After we get what we want, you get what you want. All the way? Far as you wanna go, mama, as far as you wanna go. - Where's the goods? - Upstairs. Say, baby. You mind my asking, um, what's in your bag? Man, don't ask. Uh, chess? Not bad. On a scale of one to 10, he doesn't look like much. We'll find out. Slave, are you prepared to suffer? I can look at you all day, baby. Okay, Jimmy, we're almost through. Look like the only thing we have to worry about, doc... ...is, uh, blood poisoning, huh? You know, if I didn't know you better, I'd swear that was a gunshot wound. But a gunshot wound has gotta be reported to the police. Just like I said before, doctor, it's a little household incident. But, uh, thanks a lot, hmm. You really wanna thank me? - Then go to bed for two weeks. - Ha, ha. How about if I drink a whole lot of milk instead? Lay down for a few minutes. - Been up there a long time, man. - Your move. Man's got to be convinced, brother. Check. Shh. What are they doing up there? - You know those chicks socially, Jagger? - Socially? No way, man. They are strictly business. I've gotta find out what they're doing. You go up there, brother, they just might haul your ashes in there. He's all yours. But make it quick. I don't like to wait. And he's in no condition to start all over again. And I was gonna walk in here... You gonna talk to me now, mother, or do I let those birds peck on you? No more, no more. No more. Who killed House? Tell me, who killed House? Me, me. I did it, I did it, l... You tell me, huh? Where is Wendy? The girl you took from the hospital. - Where is she? - I took her. I took her to the compound. What compound? What kind of damn compound? Feather. Feather. He did it. He did it all. Him and the doctor. - They... - Tell us, man. Who is the doctor? Who's Feather? They are gonna kill every one of you. Black, brown, tan. Oh, that's bullshit. No way they can do that. They can. They can. Fortrero found a way. He's smart. It's test tube... Test-tube stuff. He's got the brains and Feather's got money. They're gonna do it now. And it doesn't matter what you do to me... ...because they are gonna get you all. You say it clear, man, and you say it again. Washington, L.A. and Detroit. Just you wait and see. It's gonna be like flies. They're gonna drop just like flies by the millions. And only the niggers. Ain't gonna hurt nothing but niggers. He's flipped out, man. He's flipped out. You think I'm crazy? Well, then you wait. It's gonna happen sooner than you think, and there's nothing you can do about it. They are gonna be dead by the millions. Ha, ha. No. No. No, you... No, you can't... No. No, you... Man, look what you did. No, baby, you just scared the poor son of a bitch to death. Lait. We got some information about what this bullshit is about. Yeah, man, but, uh, how's Wendy? Well, she's fine, man, as far as we understand. Oh, that's good. Excepting they still got her. Hey, but the cat did tell us something about, uh, Washington, L.A., Detroit. Something about some stuff in somewhere. But, uh, we had to charm him to death to get it out. Permanently. That's not a hell of a lot to go on, man. That's kind of light on details, you know? Hey, but we do have some facts. Wherever House was at, that guy was at the same place. Because they're telling the same story. Yeah, this guy Feather was bankrolling this organization with a doctor, uh... - Fortrero. - Yeah, that's right. That's a heavy number those dudes are up to, man. Well, you wanna just stand around here... ...and wait and see if they can pull it off? Looks like it, uh, all comes out even, don't it? Yeah, that's right, brother. Three the hard way. Three cities and three of us. You freaks! You butchering lunatics! She appears to be quite healthy still. In excellent spirits. We can always tame her a little. No. We need her just as she is. Jimmy's getting to you, isn't he? You know, you guys are in way over your head. Well, actually, we have run into a slight delay. It seems your Jimmy has aligned himself with two other savages. Well, I've got a pretty good idea of who they are. And let me tell you something. When the three of them get through with you... What makes you think the three of them will survive the next 24 hours? Let's just say I know. Want me to quiet her down a little? No. Just keep her amused. - Get her back to her room. - With pleasure. I assume you're, uh, saving her for some sort of emergency. It's only fitting. We lost a lot of men in New York. Due to their own stupidity. You do have a problem with the quality of help around here. No telling what those devils are gonna do next. Precisely why we must move ahead. Maintain our time schedule. We mustn't delay. I don't like to take chances. We may lose our chance if we hesitate. Do you remember what you said to me when we first met? Yes, I remember. You asked me to secure a place for you in history. Yes, history. This is your moment, Mr. Feather. This is your glorious moment. History is watching, waiting for your decision. All right. Yes. Yes. We go forward. - Oh, come on, Charley. - You would not believe this town, man. When you were gone, you know? I'm telling you. Ha-ha-ha. Tell me about it. Hey, I see you, uh, took good care of my machine while I was gone, huh? Man, did I score with this machine. Man, if you need a machine to score, you'd better hang it up. I need all the help I can get, automotively or otherwise. - But what a way to go, man. - Ha-ha-ha. Get in the goddamn car. - You see that? - Big as life. - We better make a phone call. - Yeah. Let them know we ain't the only ones who just arrived. Some man just called and said that if you want to talk to Wendy... ...be on the corner of Eldridge and Harding at 3:30. Then he hung up. I don't... Hello? - Wendy? - Jimmy. Jimmy, l... - Jimmy. Can you hear me, baby? Are you there? Wendy? Lights out for darky. Ha-ha-ha. - Yeah, we mashed his ass. - Yeah, flatter than a cow turd. What do you got that map for? I just wanna make sure we know where the Pacoima Dam is. Tonight's one time we don't wanna be late. What time are we supposed to meet the guys? Eight sharp. I tell you, Frank, I don't give a damn what the doctor says. You ain't gonna find me drinking this water in L.A. after we get through. What are you worried about? That bug only likes dark meat. Ha-ha-ha. Unless you got a black skeleton rattling around in your closet somewhere. What's the matter, boss? I need your help, man. Jagger. - What are you doing in Detroit? - I came to see you, baby. You sure are sweet, especially when you're lying. You know I'd never lie to you, mama. You know that. - Jimmy? - Yeah, little brother, I'm all right. No, Jag, it's definitely gonna be the water supply. I already talked to Keyes in Washington and he's moving. So am I, brother. So am I. Hang it up, mama. I got work to do. Hey, Jimmy. Man, I have something to say to him. Will you split? Sure. You got that gun I wanted? This isn't fat, baby. Let's go. Well, well, Jimmy, you sure have made yourself scarce. - I've been looking everywhere for you. - I'm busy, Di Nisco. Why don't you go and find a hooker to bust, huh? Don't give me that shit, man. I could bust you right now. I am in a hurry and I'm leaving. - Charley, do you have my clothes? Yes, I have. Stay in the car. All right, mister, I got a question and you got the answer. Gentlemen... ...countrymen... ...brothers. Today is our glorious day. The moment that we have waited for... ...worked for, has come. Even as we stand here together, victory is ours. Not for ourselves but for our posterity. The achievements of Los Angeles... ...Washington and Detroit... ...will soon be known to history. They cannot stop us. We have begun to march. No power on earth can stop us now. You dudes don't have anything better to do than stand around here doing nothing? Hey, what you so happy about? You're like the cat that swallowed the bird. - What is it with you? - Come on, brother, I'll show you. Looks pretty good, huh? You see, I grabbed up all the facts and I grabbed up all the tools. We gotta hurry up because I don't want them to know what happened. We're really gonna boogaloo tonight, baby. - I hope we don't wake up the neighbors. - Come on. Fantastic. Here you go. Clips. Look, that rubber suit is gonna protect you from electricity. - Still be careful, huh? I gotcha. And, uh, take a gun. All right, let's move. Thank you all very much. This is only the beginning. Victory is ours. Today has been our glorious day. Oh. You gotta get over and get that box. It takes care of the gate. - All right, give me two. - I bet two first. - I'll see it. Give me the two cards. - Okay. Okay, cut it. Well, gentlemen, one sip and, uh, back to the lab. Thank you for all your efforts, doctor. We could not have done this without you. Science has never advanced without what you have been able to supply. Oh. - And this, of course. - Yeah. - Bye-bye. - Thank you, doctor. I'll have you bet. Not bad. Not too bad. - I'll bet two. - I'll see that and raise you two... I can't lose. I'll see that and raise you one. Double or nothing... I know you're bluffing and I'm gonna cream you this time. It'll cost you to see it. Damn, the stuff hits the fan now. We gotta get Wendy out of there, baby. Let's go. Stop them! - Mr. Feather. - We're under attack. Doctor, your papers. Destroy everything. What do you mean? I can't. Don't argue with me. Destroy them. You. You bring the black bitch to my office. Now! What's happening? Why? Goddamn, what have you got in that gun? This one's mine, baby. I gotta take Mister Keyes and get Wendy. You can handle that half, I know. Let's go. Cover me, Keyes. With a goddamn gun, please. - They're getting closer. - You bet they are. They're gonna close you and this damn... You shut up! You're gonna get me out of here. Keyes! Go and see if Wendy's in that building. I'll see if she's in here. Yeah. It's just me, the window washer, baby. - Jimmy. - Get to the jeeps. The jeeps. Jimmy! Jimmy! - Hey... - Get out of my way, you fool. Jimmy! Hey, thanks, brother. Now get Wendy to the van and we'll meet you there later. Jimmy. Damn, brother, you almost missed it. No, I didn't. Yeah, what you mean by that? Boom. Hey, Jimmy. Huh? The man here just said, uh, "boom." - You mean, uh, finish it, huh? Right on. Well, let's go.
