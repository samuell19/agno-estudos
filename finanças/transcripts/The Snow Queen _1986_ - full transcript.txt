THE SNOW QUEEN Green was the great stone of the Crown of Darkness - but it was covered in ice. There is a prophecy. When the stars of the Northern sky are born anew - he who breaks the ice with a black sword - shall gain possession of the green stone. If he then places the whole crown upon his head - he shall become master of the world. Then nothing shall be as it was before. The waters will turn to crystal. The sun shall be covered in frost. The moon encased in silver. Time... shall cease. Kerttu! Ouch! Kai, I found something! Stone, be green, be ready. Excuse me, have you seen Kai? Hey you, can you tell me if Kai has passed by? Poor little girl, how did you find yourself on the water? Where are you travelling, mademoiselle? I'm looking for Kai. Have you seen him? I'll have to think about that, il faut penser. Maybe I have, who knows? I see, I hear, I sing. Grenadiers, at ease. Isn't she sweet? Young lady, come and tell me more about this hero of yours. Passionant, how exciting! Voil?! Have another chocolate heart if you want, ma ch?rie. Won't you stay with me a while? I'm very lonely, for I have no friends. Hardly anyone comes here. Forget your silly adventure. For a charming young lady like you, boys are nothing but trouble. I know. I have seen the world and the world has seen me. I used to be a ballet dancer, prima ballerina. A respected queen of the dance. Now all I have left are my memories. And... This... Lovely... music box. Kerttu! Kerttu! Isn't it beautiful? Wouldn't you like to dance as beautifully? I would. Forget! You'll never have to leave here. I've always wanted a little girl like you. You'll see, we'll be happy together. I'll give you a present. Ready. Now! Dear God, how sweet! Charmant. I'm going to faint. Ma ch?rie, look at the doll. Hands high above your head. Round, round. Perfetto, exactly! Bend your head to the side, that's it. How beautiful, bella! Am I as beautiful as the doll in the music box? Yes, you are, as beautiful and accomplished. Da capo! Round and round. Bravo, how beautiful! Art is so wonderful. Drink! Don't eat it, you'll forget! Intorno. One, two, three, four. Good, and up. Intorno. Balance. Intorno... Remember your neck, remember your legs. Round and round. That's it, my rosebud. Remember your arms. Faster, faster. More, more. Mon dieu! What are you doing? Horrible. Don't spoil this. If you wish to be a dancer, you must obey, love art and me! This isn't fun anymore. Ah, my nerves! I've lost my fan. Go and find it. I'm melting. Look in the cupboard. Kerttu. Maija. Liisa. Who are these? Look on the table. "How to catch little girls". "Enchanted chocolate hearts". Enchanted? Kerttu! What's keeping you? We'll continue in a minute. My rosebud, have a chocolate. We'll continue again tomorrow. We'll dance, dance together forever. You are my ice prince. I have forgotten Kai. Don't cry, your love can still save you. Who are you? We used to be little girls. -The witch turned us into roses. We couldn't resist her. If you don't obey her, she'll cast a spell on you too. Horrible! -Horrible, horrible... We take turns being the doll in the music box. Dancing forever. -We can never escape. Don't waste time. -Hurry. Or the witch will hold you forever. -Escape quietly. So she won't see. -So she won't wake up. So she won't hear. -You have to save yourself. Hurry. -Hurry, hurry... My doll! Hurry, hurry... Kerttu! Kerttu! My darling, come and have some delicious chocolate hearts. Kerttu! Come and dance. Mon amour, don't be afraid. Come out. Kerttu! Don't go! Grenadiers, attention! Attention! Destroy! Kerttu... -Come with us! I must find Kai. Kai, you can break the ice with the black sword - and retrieve the green stone, only you. Grant my request, and I'll crown you with the Crown of Darkness - and make you ruler of the world, because I love you. The crown shall regain its power - once the green stone adorns it. Absolutely not. You may not touch the crown yet. Kai's button. Kai has been here. To the maiden he is dear So I heard when I tried to sleep near here I saw Kai, that's clear You're looking for Kai? -Do you know where he is? Something of the sort. Have you seen him? Something of the sort. If it's Kai, he's forgotten you because of the princess. Does he live with a princess? Yes, and sleeps in her bed. Every word is true. My sweetheart in the castle knows everything. The princess is madly in love with this noble youth. I think Kai has been snatched. He'd never wander this far on his own! If you fall in love, you are in love Or you freeze for the lack thereof Don't cry, we're on our way to the castle. My sweetheart will find a way, and you will get Kai back. Only my sweetheart, that tiny and tender sparrow. She can lift the lid atop the moon. She washes it with silver hands and laughs like a chime. With my sweetheart's smile, summer is at its best My sweetheart's arms are like a bird's nest The Guards and lackeys will never let you in the castle - but we'll sneak you in. My fianc? has told me about you. Your story moves me deeply. Kai! It wasn't Kai after all. I'm bored. I don't want to sleep anymore. Let's have some fun! Do you want bilberry candyfloss or some other flavour? I'm dying of thirst. Play is life, rain or shine. How do you know there's a dragon on the roof? The house is on fire. Don't tickle me! -Don't tickle me! What's pink and chirping? A dragon in pyjamas, and the chirping is just a bluff. Why does a dragon drink water all the time? He's in love with a match. Kerttu, your hair needs cutting. It's too long. Do you want another meringue tower? Stop poking my fortress! Off with the head! Look. How ugly! Stop it! I'll bite! -No you won't! Stop it, you're horrible! Where are you going? -The party isn't over yet. I have to find Kai. -But you can't go yet. You need to be properly equipped for the journey. Grant my wish, and I'll crown you with the Crown of Darkness - and make you ruler of the world. Listen, darling. How about some juniperberry sauce? I am a little hungry. -So am I. I wonder what you'd taste like in juniperberry sauce. Ouch, you little flea! Don't ask who did it Don't ask who's to blame Here the moon is veiled in fog Here footprints vanish from sight We are the kings of shadows What we need we take We're burnt by black fire First snow falls in our souls We burnt the doll's house And stole the ashes The kings of shadows Children run down Caramel Street Looking for a stray balloon Fairytale books are smoking Gold changes hands The princess is in a cage Crying for help We are the kings of shadows What we need we take We're burnt by black fire First snow falls in our souls We burnt the doll's house And stole the ashes The kings of shadows The scent of prey In the Dark Downwind, in the shadows The puma waits When you least expect it The puma leaps Just a quiver in the grass Soon you'll be gone! Run away and hide Beg for mercy The shadow of the wolf Will cover you It's no use your fighting back Soon you'll be gone! Poor orphan is lost Ran away from home Happily step into the trap Feel the robber's fingers The hyena will lick your cheek Soon you'll be gone! Life is but frolicking For the merry robber boys Gather round, all the robbers Sing and laugh Drink and steal Dine and make noise But if you don't have Plunders and loots There will be no drinks Or tomorrows, brothers You must avenge everyone And raise your glasses! I'm not going to eat you. But we have our boring Ronald the Robber Prince. Why don't we sell this princess to him - since he doesn't have a bride? We're sure to get a sack of gold coins. Shut up, baby. That's my magic reindeer. What are you freezing for? Put these rags on. I sure have it good. I'm a sophisticated lady with a magic reindeer and a princess. Let's see if you look like a real robber. You look like a bowl of porridge! Let's mess up your hair. Spit, put your hands in your pockets and whistle. Where did you get Kai's button? I don't get it. I was walking when suddenly. Pow! That thing fell from the sky on my skull. From the sky? I saw some lady fly by real fast with a boy. He was out cold. Then she blew a storm over the black and red country. And then suddenly: pow! That thing fell from the sky on my forehead. I was lucky I wasn't killed. Where did the woman and the boy fly to? North. But now I'm too tired to talk anymore. I always sleep with a knife. You never know round here. Let's go to sleep. You're an okay princess. I won't let them sell you. Unless I become mad at you. Let's go to sleep. Why is it a magic reindeer? -It flies. Who dares to trespass in my kingdom? I have promised you all, but you won't get the crown yet. Kai! You have been in mortal danger. I want you alive. Will you be my own Kai? You're looking for that boy, Kai. Who are you? I'm the Sorceress of the North. I live here on the borderline of white and black. Snow and earth. I warm my old bones with the glow from the heart of the earth. What place is this? Why is it so dirty? Dirty? It's earth, dear girl, clean earth. North of here is the kingdom of the Snow Queen. For the time being. Do you know her? -Yes, and she knows me. She's wary and maybe even a little afraid of me. Long ago, when light and darkness were still battling on earth - a magic green stone fell from the Crown of Darkness into a well. If the Snow Queen doesn't get the stone back - her power will be drained. If she does get it, her power will be eternal. But the Snow Queen can't retrieve the stone herself - because her hand would freeze the well again. She needs a human being - because a human hand is warm. Only a human can break the ice with the black sword - and only at a certain moment. That's why the Snow Queen took Kai as his prince. Will Kai become a prince? The Crown of Darkness would freeze Kai forever. Tonight, there will be a sign in the Northern sky. There is not much time. Did you take these? They belong to Kai! Those buttons have the power of goodness against the Snow Queen. But they aren't enough. There are bad guards in her castle. I'll give you a cloak to hide you from the Snow Queen. Remember this. The guards will doze off for a while at midnight. That's when you must enter. If you fail, there will be no second chance. Do you dare to go? -Yes. Don't forget your friend. Now the reign of light will end. The spell must be recast with the black sword. For that, I need a human child. Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Now the spell has been cast and the world is undone. We have won the battle against the senseless powers. Kai, come! Kai, come! Good night, world. Kai! Subtitles: Minna Nuutinen Broadcast Text
