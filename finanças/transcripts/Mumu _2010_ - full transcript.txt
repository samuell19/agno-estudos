Children playing And walking with a happy heart to the belfry of his village Swing Music - I am 11 years and I'm called Breaststroke. It's my nickname because it is the only swimming I practice. It is 1947. I have just been expelled from a new school. My father was imprisoned in '39 released in '45. He picked me up with his car. - Hello. - To my parents I am really a bad kid. This time it was really disgusting. I should never have been expelled. Bordier had been exaggerating the Prefect of Discipline should have seen that. - Are you proud of yourself? - I swear, it's false! I never said that! I swear Bordier invented everything. I told him about stuff ... ... I did with cousins but nothing more. - Of course! - I swear. This time, it wasn't me. - Delafie knows my way of thinking. For the priest, my friend from prison, it is disgusting ... ... To believe that. - You told him? - Yes. - Why is it that you're so dirty? Do you see the dirt? Finish undressing and then begin to wash yourself. * "Clouds" (Django Reinhardt) Give me the soap, I'll wash your head. But ... your hair is Glued ..! Is it split peas? - A friend ... ... put his soup on my head. - You find that funny? Your buddy from prison Could do nothing? - He said no.
