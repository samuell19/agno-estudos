Bring your escorted tours here, I'll take care of you myself! I'll tell Chua Lam that we're full, okay? Look at our new hotel... Fabulous lake view, low-carbon emissions... State-of-the-art facilities, bright and clean... We're SO beyond five stars. Is that so Your hardware is worthy of five stars... But your software - your staff - are all four stars only, you know Did you see your online reviews? The "dislikes" are in my FACE. We don't care about that crap... A client of yours asked for a 7am morning call You guys called her at noon! This is a resort... so we let her sleep some more... and... it's boring here that early.. Fine. You had a client who smoked in his room And Miss Peach Tin made him cry! How could she? You KNOW smoking isn't allowed in the rooms! He made a burn in the carpet too You know how OCD Peachy is He should be thanking his stars she didn't beat him up Mr. OK Pao. I've stuck by you throughout your four star career till now I should really be Friend of the Year. You know what they used to call my tours? "Excitement Before It Happens" ...and now because of you, it's "Refunds Before It Happens" ...how can you be so shameless! If Chua Lam wants your rooms, Give them to him, I don't want them. No! Fatty! Save me, Fatty! We're this close to hitting our fiscal target this month If we can't make the numbers, we'll all get sacked! Save me, Fatty! Help... Okay, okay. Stop it. I get all softie when you cry like that. I don't have ten tours... I'll bring in four or five and you try it out, okay? Two or three is enough, just about hits the mark... Four or five is too much, Fatty! You jerkwad... Quality not quantity, Fatty! DON'T call me Fatty anymore, I've lost all the weight for YEARS now. Dang girl, you be rake thin like a homeless pup! Bark a little. Woof! Okay! Daily meeting! What's new in F&B? Last night at the VIP party... ...they all got drunk... no one counted how much they ordered, so... There are two bottles of vintage 2000 Dom Perignon.. ...sitting in my locker... ...and they're ours! Yes! Alright, seriously now... Peachy“. Any problems in Housekeeping? Why do you think there might be problems? Just... asking... Sorry, don't mind me, have some chocolate. How about Reception? L...checked in Da Wah by mistake... Damn! Why did you let him check in? Ugh, Why! They call him "Da Wail" for a reason you know... Shuts himself in hotels for weeks before every stand-up show and if he's got creative block he'll cut himself... He's been blacklisted by the industry long ago! How could you let him in? But he looked so sad! More the reason why you shouldn't have done it! Yesterday he looked kinda rough. So I talked to him for a bit... Don't do anything silly Let me tell you a joke.. It's hilarious... Do you know what's the name of the book that Consists of all seven volumes of the Harry Potter series? "Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha!" After that, I saw him chug the entire bottle of whisky. This looks like a serious case of Da Wail, don't think he'll make it tonight I gave him a room on the 1st floor, he can't die from that height if he jumps When I cleaned his room I took away all the sharps, even the curtain cords... But he is here for seven days... How can we get rid of him? Look at this... I'm a really jittery person, the doctor calls this... "The Ultimate Scaredy McScareson... " Scares-aphobia Scare-city... Scare-nacious Syndrome." "This Syndrome..." Looks like a scaredy cat to me... Let's scare him away! Room 108, Turn up the AC please! He'll be scared witless with the "Mop Ghost" Not quite yet... All I do is "woo", that's not very scary! I can't open my eyes either.. Can you move around a little? Ok! No problem! One, two, three! Oh no! Under the leadership of our Assistant Manager, OK Pao The Great, we have successfully gotten rid of Da Wail. Cheers to our Assistant Manager! It was a team effort! Let's toast! Yes! By the W33' I heard that the position of the Executive has been filled Really? It's got to be you, Manager Pao! How shall we celebrate? Ck! The day of my promotion, I'll treat everyone to... Crab claws! I'll come over to open the door for you... That's alright, you take your time. Take a rest first. "There is one match found." "28.3" "To Fire?" "Fired." "Goodbye." Better days from here onwards once I am promoted. Look after me, ok? The email says you're not the one promoted! No way! Who else can it be? Cruella Koo? Why would you name your child like that? Looks like her father wasn't all there in the head. Don't say that. Maybe it was her mother I would like to check in! Hello Miss, your documents please. What was the new executive called again? Cruella K00. Just K0 please, no double "0"... Just Cruel please, no "la"... I'll swear off meat for this! Easy now... easy... Miss Cruella Koo! Yes, and my mother named me that. She must have been a poetess Welcome... welcome... I've come up with this app that gives me your rankings when it comes to your work performance here If it's less than 50, you'll be fired! "55" That was close. Run! "62" Sammy got 62 points. "63" Jessica got 63 points. But that guy over there... Go up! Up! Go over! Over! "50" That was SO SCARY It's okay now, it's okay... The check-in time for a five-star hotel From the moment a guest walks in the door is an international standard of 30 seconds. It took you 60. Do you know that this vast difference of 30 seconds can change the world? If Newton walked over to the apple tree 30 seconds later than he did he would just be some dude who ate an apple and the concept of gravity would never have been realized. I am a five-star quality manager and I will not allow you four-star sheep to wreck my reputation. Can you stop that? I'm speaking. We have set cleaning times. Can you not... Call our team "sheep"? There is only staff here, there is no team The golden rule of management: Management and staff is strictly business, no personal feelings. Are you THE Peach Tin, the one who has the record unstable work performance? Average it out, it's very stable. I pass, and that's fine with me. Excuse me. Wanna bet? Let's see who gives way. Whoever loses treats us all to that 80's Karaoke bar around the corner They don't even have remote controllers there All the more to go have a look-see! Forty dollars, Cruella Koo wins. What? She's not one of us! Who cares? She's bitchy enough! I'm going for Peachy! That's a dumb move. Dumb or not, she's got the balls. Okay, I have my doubts now. Wanna change your mind? Can I? ' B6 Quiet!!! - Shut Up! Sorry! Sorry! This hotel is ranked number 18 in the district I will make it number 1 within 3 months. Starting from tomorrow. I have arranged for a film crew to shoot here for one week Starting today, all leaves will be canceled and we will serve them during this time. Most importantly we serve those stars... so they will speak well of us to the media And, we must make them Spend spend Spend! How ferocious. I am, indeed.

But I have arranged for two... identical Grand Suites for the two ladies.. I'm the Executive Manager, Cruella K00 I will be serving you, Miss Audrey... I just love your smile...

Audrey Audrey I love you! Audrey... Hush, you must all be quiet, don't disturb others, okay? Okay! Okay! Bye bye! Miss Marilyn.. This is our Grand Suite. What is she doing? Don't bother her meditating, she will go crazy if you do. Sweetie, your schedule has changed... 3pm, photo shoot... 4pm, script meeting with director... 5pm, you... Why is there a Mutated Mickey here? I saw it on your Weibo, you said you liked it So I got it for you... Wait a minute...your name is OK Pao Are you my Weibo fan "Pao Oh Kay" My name was jumbled and you still recognized me! Last year when I got the Newcomer Award You wrote me a poem Yes Roses are red, Violets are blue, Marilyn is the best so it sucks to be you! I did good didn't I You really remembered Thank you... if it weren't for my fans, I don't know where I'd be now. Don't doubt yourself You can do it! Anyway, you look famished. The fish heads here are a delicacy I know you have a sweet tooth. So I thought of a dish for you.. Crystallized Sweet Fish Head! I'm tired. I'll leave you to rest now, Miss Marilyn. Let me know if I can help you with anything! Hey... Yes... Actually I'm kinda hungry. Why don't you get one of those Crystallized Fish Heads for me then. OK! OK! OK! It's coming out!!!! Please come in... Oh my god it's poking out of my ass... That way... It's poking out! It's coming out! Well goodness, that was an award-winning performance just now in the elevator by Miss Audrey, wasn't it? She was a gangster way back when. They called her The Jordan Road Bitch. Anyway, let's have someone take away that stand over there I want to put a crystal there, for luck. Some peach blossoms here, for fortune. I know that Miss Audrey loves her fine cuisine I have prepared for her our gourmet caviar and champagne It's being brought here now No thanks. I know what you're up to. You want us to spend money on room service? We don't want it! We have enough instant noodles to feed an army You will sign for the peach blossom tree. OH HELL. Your turf, your problem. What's the matter, Miss Audrey? My diamond earring fell into the toilet bowl! I will have someone come over right away. Jesus what a party. I had hot pot this morning. Weren't you just on a flight? I can't have hot pot on a plane? Miss Koo, this should really be an Engineering Dept. thing I don't care which department you get Just get a hand in there and pick it out! It's not that I can't do it... But Miss Koo here said that rules are rules So we have to follow the book. Did you really say something that stupid? Our hotel does have its own policy... Miss Audrey it would be best for you to stay out of this. Oh I'm staying out of this for sure. I'm asking for you two to fish out my earring! According to our hotel policy... there is nothing that concerns me here... I am going back to work. So it's you then. I will go grab some gloves. What gloves? Just dig in. Excuse me! There. Miss Koo. Your earring should be in there. Go fish it out yourself now. It's not right for me to go through your personal belongings. Miss Audrey it would be best if you did it yourself. If there is nothing else, that will be all. You don't have to thank me. It's not for you! It's for the hotel! I'm not going to thank you. Of course, it's for the hotel only! That's what I mean! Why do you have to repeat it? That's what I mean! When did I repeat it? You're the one who repeated it! "Hey I just met you..." "And this is crazy...but here's..." "my number...so..." Take a chill pill, Phil. Oh my god. Marilyn hugged me yesterday. Just a "go away" will do You didn't have to add "the fudge" in the middle. Don't tell everybody! No one would believe it even if I did. Hey Peachy. So a film crew is here to shoot, eh. Do you think this will springboard my acting career? You all know... I'm just a born natural. Just a simple "grow up" will do You didn't have to add "the fudge" in the middle. I'm going to fight for my spot no matter what When I'm famous one day you won't be getting my autograph. You're crazy! Let's ask her over. Look at her Such an attitude! Reading English, red wine... High class executive, huh? If she comes over here PHleave. I think it's all a facade. Underneath all that, she's just a little girl at heart. I think it's so pretentious. Look at her. She eats like a cow. She's looking at you! It's YOU! YOU! You... You... YOU!!! OK Pao! Yes! Come make the rounds with me! Be right there! Make the rounds? What is she, the police? Don't die on the job now! Don't fall in love! Just a simple "shut up " will do - You didn't have to add "the fudge" in the middle. What? Good work! Let's do this! Shoot something good! Why is it any of your business? We have to support the Hong Kong film industry. This is the difference between four stars and five stars. This is good for you, so listen and listen well: Confucius said, "if it's not your position, you don't tend to the affairs" The ultimate management is... If it concerns you, you do your best... If it doesn't concern you, no matter how hard you try, it doesn't concern you. So if it's none of your business, don't tend to it If it's none of your business, don't touch it! Did you get that? Yes Where? Here! Remember it here!! Tell me you get it. I do. Smile! You're not exactly blessed in looks you know... Try to smile... Yes! Just like that! Keep smiling, keep this smile! Are you okay? I'm sorry, let me help you... I got you all dirty. Are you kidding? Do you have any common sense? How could you go save her and not the light? Lights will break, but she will be fine! Miss Koo, are you alright? I was so scared for you! So why didn't you save me just now? I thought you would die for sure! No I mean... I reacted too slowly, so I couldn't make it. I don't want to see you! Scram! This is bad! Do you need work? Yes I'm here all the way from Dong Bei... I just joined crew for two days... oh no! OK Pao! coming! Hire him as our Security Manager. Manager? Go register at Human Resources. Thank you! Thank you! Miss Koo you have an icy exterior but a big warm heart. He moves fast and that position has been vacant for so long Just give him a third of what we used to give the previous manager He'll be thrilled! Genius! I learned so much today!

In your last postcard, you said you Went to Iceland for Taekwondo lessons Yes, but theMaster... he went to the hot springs, so he wasn't there But you MUST go to Iceland There is nothing there But the sky is really blue, and the air is so icy When you breathe it's like your lungs just had peppermint candy. That's so cool I can just look at the sky from here I've never been to New York, and I've never skied. That's not a bad piece of sky right there. But if you have a chance You have to go look at other pieces of skies. Don't you have to work? I'll just pretend I've been to places looking at stickers on people's luggages. Oh yes... What is it? Actually I'm here because I need your help. Don't worry! Bo Bo's problem is Pao Pao's problem! I will help you for sure! OK! I'm sure you all recognize this guest, Someone who has been our customer since our four-star days at our previous establishment. My good brother, Miss Bo Bo Mo-Yung. She's here because she needs some help. I'm the first one to say yes! Miss Bo Bo always keeps her room clean and neat I love her. It's all very simple really. My father left me an inheritance but my uncle is in charge of it all I can only inherit this fortune after I get married. That's it? Your uncle's a wicked one He wants all your family fortune! Yes! Not only has he cut my monthly expenses, He has been up to his tricks in the company I think he wants the entire company to himself See? I called it! Totes. So I have to find someone to marry me right away in order to inherit the fortune So that it doesn't fall into my uncle's hands. But your uncle won't approve of your marriage. You don't have to worry about that. The will states that as long as I have my grandparents' approval, my uncle has no say! So what's the problem? I have to find a decoy fianc'm That's easy You guys are real buddies, right? Solved. Look at me! It's not convincing whatsoever her grandparents will never fall for it! And I'm the Assistant Manager. I'm in the lobby all the time. I'm recognizable. Don't worry, Bo B0. We're all behind you on this. We'll help you set this straight. Enough! Do I not exist? You guys are attempting to pull off what seems like a fake marriage to me. This will most certainly not happen within my management. Bo Bo What's the budget for your wedding? Budget-wise... that won't be a problem. I have nothing but money. So.. I don't have a budget! So I can mark up all the wines and champagnes to 150%? Too bad Miss Koo won't let us do this... Bo Bo Let's do your wedding at the motel next door... and give them your business! You can stop all the acts. What I'm hearing is that Miss Mo-Yung here would like to hold the grandest, biggest wedding ever! I didn't hear anything else. In simple terms... I take all the glory, you guys can do all the chores. That's it. So where shall we start? The decoy husband. Let's go. No way... Both tall AND short! No,no,no,no. This is good stuff!! Bo Bo, Bo Bo... I wanted to find you someone special... for your grandparents... But you don't like any of them... Why don't you tell me what you want! Okay. I want someone who is honest.. Not weird... Someone who won't want my money even after he marries me Go find him for me! If there is someone that honest I'll chop off my balls. Hello I don't want tips This is my responsibility. Just a little then. No you are too kind. I really don't want it. Okay... okay then. Crazy! Do it! Do it! Plastic knife? Out Of my way! It's not that I don't want to let you pass! It's that I can't! Go! Peachy! Miss Peach! Someone is changing your linens! Who would dare? Why are you changing my linens, Sir? I have to use my own! No! This is our policy! Even though a bit old still has that girlish quality... Come again? Even though a bit old... the other line! Still has that girlish quality... You have good taste. I'm sorry, I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder... When I'm nervous I relax When I relax I... say everything from my heart... I'm not new to your kind.. It's nothing. I'll be cleaning your room from now on. I'll help you rearrange it all. Clean and neat, orderly. Thank you. Why is there only red? I only eat the reds. And I only eat the yellows. That's great. I'll save you the yellow ones from now on. You give me the red ones. It's great we get along so well! Not that well. Don't touch it! Isn't this better? Yes Just right, just right... That looks better, actually. Yes, it's great. Really great. Miss Peach I'm having dinner with my relatives in a bit If you have time, I would love it if.. You joined me for dinner. I don't know them! Why should I go? Please don't get the wrong idea... I'm a weird guy It's so hard for me to come across... Someone that I get along with, that's all. And you can... help me. Uncle. Uncle? This is my favorite niece, Bo Bo. Uncle. Have a seat! Why is Peachy there?! How do I know? My name is.. Peach Tin... I just met your uncle... and I'm here to help... ...help! Ohhh... That's... cool. This is Mark Lui. He is my fianc“m. They call me "The Prince". You? A Prince? That's what it says on the fact sheet. Bo Bo This guy is kind of a goof. What do you like about him? He has a great smile And an honest face. The best kind of husband there is. He wouldn't cheat even if a hooker landed on his face. A hooker... what? I just.. made that up, okay. Yes... I just love your smile, darling. How did you meet? 2011, June 28th, 3:12am... No no... It was... 6:12pm... in... France... Paris... Charles De Gaulle Airport! Holy shizzles! SILLY!

You got me in the middle of nowhere before I had a chance to eat my ham! Alright, let me go look around for food. Don't you go anywhere! That's a lot of mushrooms and fruit! Wait! Does it taste better this way? O It's just that I don't feel quite right if things aren't arranged in order. I have this urge to make it all neat. I'm weird, aren't I? I am too. My linens HAVE to be folded at 45 degrees. I have to touch the wall when I'm walking. When I shop, I have to buy in pairs. I use single count in toilet paper! Or I just can't... go. By the time you use it, aren't you done? I count before I go. You seem too aloof to be an evil villain. You know... I love Bo Bo very much. That's why I must stop this marriage. You're crazy. Your COLLEAGUES are crazy. Putting up that stupid act. Especially that old guy. His acting sucks. Yeah, he does suck. He's the only one who thinks he's a star. So why didn't you out us? There's no hurry, wait till Grandpa and Grandma gets here. I'm sorry, you made me do this. Look at this one, it's so red! That's red? That's stretching it a little... This is a local specialty! Try it! It'S good! So very sweet Is it good? Lovely... Are you done yet? Almost! Be quiet! What do you think Peachy and Uncle are up to? Don't worry Peachy is good your uncle won't be back until that ring is on your finger. Hurry UP! I SAID. I'm almost done. Okay, okay! I'm done. What's the matter? Asthma attack?

Look at that cleavage! Not bad Did you contour? If you don't mind I would like to use this photo as part of my exhibit next month, may I? Yes! And... If you have a minute... Can you send me a copy to my phone? Sure, no problem Don't do that... That's an ugly picture... I use it to ward off evil spirits okay? Marilyn said, she's terribly sorry... That I got hurt last time... She asked if I could have dinner with her tonight... I really think she digs me. Really? She digs you? How kind of her! Why don't I go with you... help you feel her out. - Ok? - No way, dude. I'll go do my makeup now. Play by play after the date. Later! Sorry about your head last time... So I decided to make you a meal myself. As a treat! You really didn't have to. It... looks great! Look at this toast, it's burnt No nutrients left in this one Won't get fat no matter what. Are you okay with this kind of food tonight? To be with my idol and eat what she makes... is my honor! I'll dig in then. Come on then This chicken breast is dried up like tree bark It's really hard to swallow I have a way Here, try it It tastes good! How is it? Its... Very... Fresh!! It's the paparazzi. Looks like our date will have to end tonight. That door opens! Go inside! It might not have to. Come with me Inside, go inside... Go left... in the kitchen... Watch the floor! Be careful! You'll fall! Who are you? Out! Out! You can come out now! C)h I had so much fun tonight Me too I'll go inside now Have some rest. Would you... like to come in for some coffee? Nah, I can't sleep with coffee this late Oh... okay then. Goodnight Goodnight. Stars are really weird They like to invite people for coffee this late, huh. Damn! Oh dang dang dang dang dang. How did it go? How did it go? I'm such an idiot... You know what happened tonight? What? Marilyn cooked for me and it was awful But I said it was awesome And then some paparazzi wanted to shoot us And we ran into the kitchen The floor was really slippery so then I held her hand and W6 ran ran ran ran ran and I held her hand hand hand hand THEN FINALLY I brought her back to her room... and she looked at me sweetly. And said.. "Would you like to come in for coffee?" So did you go in? I didn't! Oh why didn't you! I KNOW! Why didn't I? OMG. So if I go back to her NOW, and I say, hey, I thought about it And NOW I want some coffee, do you think that works? NO! Because when it comes to coffee, it's... all about timing. Once it's gone it's gone. So when will I have a chance again? Usually this happens... on the night of first dates... So if you missed out, you'll have to wait... another 3-7 months. I...T Take him to his room. What happened? He had some poisonous fruit. He'll drink bitter gourd juice for the next three days for a complete detox. He will be fine. And why would he do that? Because I gave it to him. You're harsh! I am, indeed. Since we're birds of a feather... can I interest you in doing something together? I am always up for a challenge. Good. I got word that .. The Association of Hotel Ratings has sent A Mysterious Rating Judge. This will be the ultimate test to our five-star status. We'll have to smoke him out. Firstly, he will be in disguise. He might be a tall, dark and handsome businessman... on a golf holiday from Florida... Or a couple from Shanghai... But what you can be sure of... is that this Mysterious Rating Judge will NOT... admit his identity. Yes... (Shanghainese) Didn't we say that before... (Shanghainese) Are you the Mysterious Rating Judge? (Shanghainese) No, I'm not, I'm not... (English) Are you the Mysterious Rating Judge? (Slovene) I don't know what you're saying! Blah blah blah.. I have no idea what you're saying either. Well? No dice! Anyone here could be him. But I personally think... It's him. That's... a bit too far now, is it? Wouldn't be the Mysterious Rating Judge if it were that easy. The Association of Hotel Ratings annually sends 400 of their Mysterious Rating Judges to hotels around the world for their star ranking They have a special ID every year, just between themselves. This year, it's a scarf with a diamond on it. Look at him! He's no rating judge! Am I.. not allowed so much? Of course you are! If it's here, it's for our guests. Sir May we help you with anything else? To tell you the truth... I'm a fisherman You're quite pale for a fisherman. Because I actually... fish at night... Nightly fishing! I've heard of nightly NEWS... I heard that... Your hotel is grand within its grade... Especially the bathroom, which has a fabulous lake view... Grand, and good feng shui... So... I want to.. It's right there up front, where the sign says make a left. I'll go try it out then... That's an excuse to use our bathroom! To check out our hotel, to check out both our hardware AND software. See if it's up to par with five-stars. So... so what do we do now? From this moment... We follow him closely... Don't let him out of our sight... and we tend to his every need. Sir... Refieved? Very!

We're doing this for charity, just offering food to the elderly... Bo Bo dear... I am so full... Please take me away! Let's go! Let's take them away! I think they're both tired I'll take them away to go rest for a bit. That might not be a problem, except... They both signed a contract, so... they'll have to pay up if they don't shoot. Let's not go there. Come on, just give me some face, eh? And why do I need to do that? That's enough! I've had it from you! "I Love You, My Dear," huh? I'm a frigging stunt man now, huh? I'm going to beat you up! Whoa whoa whoa there. Let's not get violent now. Let me show you something. What is it? Look. He's nice! He's responsible, and he takes care of the elderly. Yes Bo Bo dear, this is the one But he's not my fianc'm. Grandpa and Grandma must be hungry Here, have some cheesecake. Seriously, boy? Bo Bo What do you see in this guy? He's like a bag of wet cement. I like him... I like that he will... be silly with me He'll just speak nonsense... He takes care of me When I'm with him... I don't think about anything... Because you usually have it all thought out for me But the best part is... he makes me laugh. Every time I see him, I'm just so happy- He looks like a goof, and you're happy with that? Bo Bo Bo Bo, goofy and honest are different Goofy is really boring! Actually he's not bad, he's a good match for you He calls me dude all the time I don't even know how he feels Can't you ask him? Of course not! I'm a girl! How can the girl ask? No no no no no! You're right You know, your Grandma, I was dumb back then... I asked your Grandpa first Just doesn't make it precious, you know? Look at your Grandpa Look how arrogant he is! Are you okay? You're not hurt are you? I'm fine... Just... my chest feels a bit heavy I just need some fresh air. Brother Pao I'll go with you No, no! Bo Bo You go with him, get some fresh air! You can come home late! Let me help you.. Brother Pao... I... I'm so sorry... thank you for helping me with this wedding... Why are you so cordial with me? We're good brothers, dude! Brothers! Brothers! Oh yes, I almost forgot. Why do you have a ring? I mean, it's all for show, but you do need a ring. That's so thoughtful. You keep it. What's up? Is it Marilyn? Yes She wants to see me... in her room. She has something to say. Her room? Seems like she really likes you. Should I go? If I go, what if she wants us to have a secret affair? What if we can't make it public? What if her fans really like me.. Would that affect her? I'm not sure I can handle all this... What are you doing? I'm having second thoughts!! What second thoughts? I'm not confident about this. don't have the guts to do Let me tell you. No second thoughts. You can't look down upon yourself! But I'm nothing. When I was in India Mediator Richard Billyham taught me something... I will teach you that today. Okay, let's do this. Come on. First, lay down. Relax your entire body... Close your eyes... and then... Relax your nose... Relax your throat... your Adam's apple... Yes that's right... Now your ears... Good“. Now imagine... There is a little ball of light talking to you Pao Pao You are the world's best! Am I? You are the most handsome guy! Am I? That's great. Okay. Now the little ball is done. Done? Yep, all done. So this little ball of light... Do I keep it or do I give it back to you? You keep it Okay... okay... How do you feel? I feel... I feel really good! I'm really confident now! ' Really? ' Yes! That's wonderful! Let me tell you From today onwards You, are the best! You, are handsome! Whoever gets to be with you... She would be the luckiest girl... and... You deserve the best! Dude! When I marry Marilyn, you must come to my wedding. And Your Richard Billyham.. he's really something! Yes he is. Oh yes, so... You gotta teach me this stuff in the future, okay? I don't think I can. Why? Because“. Because tomorrow is the wedding... So after I inherit the fortune... I will go back to the States and I don't think I will be coming back. But I look forward to every time... when you come back here, and you tell me about your adventures... What you've eaten, what you've seen... Now you're telling me you won't come back? I'm going to miss you so much! You'll get used to it I Will? You Will. Okay so... there's a girl waiting for you over there. Boys shouldn't let girls wait, right? You should go. Go on.. go! Go go 9090! I won't get used to it... You Will. You've never seen me like this, huh? Yeah“. I don't think I would recognize Jay-Z if he was white. Come in. So... ever since you turned me down for coffee last time I began to know the real you. What was that? I'm sorry I want to ask, where did you buy this bottle of whisky? It's great! I have a friend who would love this. Take it then. You shouldn't have! But I want to thank you. Miss Marilyn Have you ever... had someone in your heart that you couldn't stop thinking about? You'll think of that person when you come across something you've eaten, something you want to share. Have... have you? I... I haven't. But I think I can understand that. Actually I have something to tell you too. Oh. I've accepted an offer, the film is called "Ordinary Love" The director wants me to get a feel of what it's like to love an ordinary guy, and I got to meet you, so I... So it's not that you really like me... I'm this ordinary guy... No wonder you cooked for me, and invited me for coffee. Are you mad at me? I was! But... now I don't have time to be mad I really miss someone right now So much that my heart hurts I want to go find her now! If I tell you now, that I... have feelings for you... What would you do? Your acting has improved ten-fold! Those must be your lines from the script From the ending, is it? Didn't you say you miss her? Go chase her back! Don't waste your time! You're right! Don't waste my time! Bye Before I pronounce you man and wife legally It is my duty to remind you That although your wedding ls not bound by religious rite, So if no one comes forward to object, I will... pronounce you.. I OBJECT! What do you want? I won't let you marry him! Quit it! It's just a rehearsal! EVEN if it's just a rehearsal! Excuse me... What are you doing? You said I shouldn't have second thoughts Now I'm going to tell you what I want If you must marry You can only marry one person and that's me! If I'm going to marry There is just one person I would marry and that's you! You said whoever will end up with me will be the luckiest girl please give me a lifetime to prove it to you, I mean it! I'm sorry, dude! I've always just treated you as a brother until you said you were going to leave and then I realized I didn't want you as a brother I want to see you every day We must not separate for a moment! Marry me! What about dating? Should we not date first? I don't think so Let's not waste time We've wasted too much time If you don't mind, I want to get married right here right now! Shouldn't we... explain to Grandpa and Grandma what's going on? That's alright That's what young love is all about As long as they love each other Marry him, sweetheart! Yes! But... don't call me "dude" from now on... and don't call me "brother"... So what should I call you? There he goes again! Oh boy! - "Baby"! ' Yes! Baby Okay! Great! Straight to the point! Good man! No... I mean... baby! Okay. I am so very glad we've now progressed to the kissing part Or it would just be weird standing here! (gibberish) What does Uncle want? He is still somewhat toxicated, so he can't speak... he will be like this for a while. (gibberish) He said he is against this wedding! It's no use, we love each other You will never get the inheritance. (gibberish) It's like this... He said he's not against this marriage He is against this WEDDING! I don't get it! (gibberish) Let me do it! Your uncle isn't so bad. He's actually a nice guy who's just kind of a bad businessman. He trusted the wrong people.. And bought a mine with all the fortune... but... there was not a single lump of coal in there.. Just a cave full of stones so you came to stop us and take the inheritance to pay your debts! He doesn't have the inheritance! He spent it all to begin with! He didn't want your grandparents to worry so he tried to stop this wedding I've braved through thick and thin I've seen it all! Yes! When I was in the army, I shot planes down! Bang Bang Bang! That's right, we can have a wedding on a tight budget Just a simple dinner will do. No! We've got to make it grand! Why? Because the Mysterious Critic knows that Bo Bo will hold a grand wedding here and he will attend! So not only will it happen, we have to make it as grand as possible! Or else... we will lose our five-star status! But... Miss K00... We really don't have a budget, what shall we do? Award-winning Nick Cheung once said to me, "if you don't have it now, you won't have it in the future." Four-star is four-star, right? Why must we shoot for five-star? Let's just go find a four-star hotel who will take us! Zhuge Liang once said: "Never look down upon yourself!" You don't need anyone to give you five-stars! It's what you think of yourself that counts! We'll do this! We will do this using our way! Miss Koo Why don't you lead us into this then? Great! What a united team I have here. I'm so happy! And.. Once again, it proves... that my management philosophy is invincible! Let's give this wedding... Our best shot! Let's go, Miss Koo! Wait, wait for me? Wait! Serving fish heads as appetizers... Now this is really something else! Indeed Thank you for sponsoring our wedding feast Tonight's menu will be amazing! The fish heads are really big... there's Fish Head in Clay Pot Stew, There's Wonton Fish Head... And Fish Head Kebab, and Chili Fish Head!

Staff's getting paid. Done! - Where's the champagne? - What will we drink? Oh dear... The champagne is almost all out! Peachy“. How's it going over there? I need a few more minutes... I, the Champagne King, has been King of the industry for so long How dare you say... that you have to test my champagne? Well if we're going to buy 100 cartons We just want to be safe rather than sorry. Who twirls a flute to test champagne? You don't do that! OBAMA! Obama? Where's Obama? I ordered a banana. Try the champagne, hurry! You... This is counterfeit! I... He... This... I'm out of here! Mission accomplished! The Champagne King has left the building And the 100 cartons are ours! Exceﬂenﬂ Sadly, one of our comrades have sacrificed courageously. Hi! You... aren't you Miss Audrey, the big star? I was watching you for a very long time So many people come up to you... You must be a VIP What's a VIP? Oh my, aren't you funny What do you do? I'm a fisherman And modest, too! I should have guessed you work in fisheries It's such a hit industry now What's hit? Ladies and gentlemen Please applause to welcome the bride and her groom! Enter! Beautiful! Great! I am so happy '£0daY Because“. I've found a wonderful husband Even though he makes me mad, and he laughs at me... But I'm so happy around him.. From today onwards Pao Pao will be polite to each and every one Because from now on, you can only tease me, okay? Okay! Okay! That's great! Hi! Hi... And when it comes to coffee... He will accept no invitations from now on, because... He will only be drinking it with me. Okay? Yes, baby, of course! Do you have anything to say to me? I have a lot I want to say... Go on! But I'm not good with words, so... I never wanted to be a manager here.." I wanted to be a lounge singer." "I would fly a rocket and take you to the skies" "and live with you in space" "Live to a thousand and love you like it's the first day" "With you by my side, everything's okay" "With you in life, everything's great" "The simplest food turns into gourmet" "I'll be with you forever, every minute I need you babe" "You are my air, my sun's rays." "You are my air, my sun's rays." I'm so touched You are so emotional! It's too loud here Which room are you in? The President Suite! Can you show me around? Of course! Mr. Wong! Are you satisfied... with our arrangements? Very! I am thrilled... with Everything in the last few days That's marvelous So I suppose we would get... a stellar report? What's a report? Out of my way! I'm busy don't you see Stop the act You're the Mysterious Rating Judge I saw you with that scarf the other day I don't know what you're talking about! Mr. Wong! Miss Koo! Mark Lui What's with the outfit? I gave that fisherman my scarf. It was dirty. I am the Mysterious Rating Judge you've been looking for! This is my Association of Hotel Ratings Rating Judge ID card. My number is 7086! This is legit! My gosh! It's the Mysterious Rating Judge! I came here and was greeted... with endless insults... Your work ethic is just... unbelievably bad! F&B, taking company property! Housekeeping, the worst attitude in the world! Reception, with a fake exterior... Management is just harsh! And then, without even asking me, I got dragged into being someone's husband! I'm actually... very serious about love! I can't believe he is the Mysterious Rating Judge... That's it.. our five-star status... down the drain... Shall we beat him up? Yes! On a count of three! One! Two! Three! However... Yes, Mr. Lui? Is there a "but" somewhere? I see the way that you help each other all because you want to keep the five-star rating. This very united team effort is unheard of in other hotels From each of your weaknesses- - and there are plenty, let me tell you - there is kindness It's something that makes guests feel like home And THAT is the ultimate in the hotel industry! So our report... This is just crazy. We are five-star staff at last. And our hotel can even be called Deluxe now! What does that mean? That means we've even advanced one tier when compared to other five-star hotels. So they gave us "Deluxe" In our district we're the only hotel with "Deluxe"! So can we adjust our rates? I have my heart set on a new vacuum cleaner recently... It's so powerful it can do a master cleanse! Amazing! We need to get going. Alright, Team Deluxe, I'm going on honeymoon with Bo Bo I'll leave the hotel to you guys Work hard! Especially you! Behave! Oh baby don't you worry I will make sure you... lose your job when you come back. I am at a loss for words knowing... I have such a great buddy like you. Get me a present. I'll get you a plastic bag. Bo Bo, aren't you bankrupt? How can you afford your honeymoon? Everything's fine! Even though the mine didn't have a single lump of coal There were diamonds in the stones!! I brought some for everybody today Gorgeous! I've never seen so many... I picked the biggest one... for you! Thank you!! Miss Koo, congratulations Thanks to your report! I am here... On behalf of the Association of Hotel Ratings inviting you to go to Europe and be one of our Rating Judges. Your salary would triple what you make now. Wouldn't I want something like that!
