Highway patrol and local officials have declared a statewide emergency as these unprecedented storms continue to rage across southwestern Louisiana. The governor has urged anyone that can to please leave their home in a calm and orderly fashion. Well, it looks like this is home for the night. Fuck. Great. Dude, it's a fucking hurricane. What's that gonna do? Well, unless you plan on out running it, it's the best we got till it passes. What's your name anyway? Summer. Clarence. Been here long? Six months. I was in a band... and we broke up. All the fuckers moved home, left me with the rent that I can't make, obviously. It sounds familiar. Gimme a hand? Looks like you got it. You know, I had some friends come through town yesterday offered me a ride up to Arkansas. Should have taken it. Didn't think the second coming of Hurricane Katrina would lock us in her sights. You even old enough to remember Katrina? I was six. Just old enough to remember levees breaking. Oh, shit. Goddamn wind. I got this one. Mind seeing if there's anything we can burn that won't level the place? Wouldn't count on it. You know I was in a band once. Uh. Clarence? Ah! Yo, he trying to kill us out here or what? He's right you know. I can hardly see a goddamn thing up here. It's a shit show. I told you we should've turned back. But Shane fucking left with the goddamn forecast. You know, that's why I only trust this weather app. Sooner we drop these sweethearts off the better, right? I don't know. I think we should pull over and wait the storm out. Oh yeah? And when you think that's gonna be? I don't know. Why don't you ask that weather app? Yeah, it ain't going anywhere anytime soon. God's gonna be pissing on us for the rest of the night. Well, it's only gonna get worse at dark. Eh, you know, Lutree's pretty close to here. Why don't you radio that sheriff and see if she doesn't mind taking us in for the night. - The pretty one? - That's right. Yeah, I'm sure she'll just roll out the red carpet for all of us. Well, it's better than crashing and letting a bunch of inmates escape, isn't it? Okay. Truck's full of gas. Skis are ready to go. Keys are on Omar. As far as those keys go, you give them to no one except me? -You copy that. -Copy. Okay. God looked down on the human race and He saw wickedness, violence, and evil everywhere. It's the story of the flood. It symbolizes God's punishment for sin... That's comforting. Let's get these things loaded up and let's move. Come on. The storm has already decimated the Caribbean. Copy that. Drive safe out there. You gotta be kidding me. Where the hell is Pine? I haven't seen him. Never know with that guy though. What is that? Stress call. Department of corrections. And? Got a bus full of prisoners heading our way. Got caught in the storm, they need a place to hunker down until it's safe. -How many prisoners? -Five. Jeez, why didn't you come tell me? Well, state of Louisiana is gonna be underwater by bacon and eggs time. All right. Keep an eye up for the bus. Tell Deputy Pine if he wants to keep his job, to find me immediately. ...to evacuate across three states. You're the sheriff, Sheriff. ...the combined states of Louisiana and Alabama. Nearly seven million told to evacuate across three states. Already hundreds of thousands without power. It's just looking pretty bad out here I mean, look at it. The worse it gets, the better it is for us. Yeah. Here comes our ride. Lock and load. Where the hell are they going? I thought they were supposed to turn. So what the fuck's up, Rafe? Change of plans. Follow 'em. Highway patrol and local officials have declared a statewide emergency as these unprecedented storms continue to rage across Southwestern Louisiana. Oh, hey, Sheriff. Whitlock said you wanted to see me? Yes, I did. Okay. What's up? Look at my feet. Didn't I ask you to stack some sandbags in the alley near the back door? Yes, ma'am. But Whitlock asked me to mop the cells, so-- Well, now you're on sandbag duty. Rain is pouring down. I got a busload of prisoners coming in. And if you'd done what I'd asked, we wouldn't be walking around in gumbo right now. Sorry, Sheriff. Uh, I'm on it. Hey, wait, did you just say we have prisoners coming in? -Pine. -Anyone famous? I'm on it. I'm on it. Oh. My God. Sheriff Newman should deploy the mayor for this. Well, I'm gonna go find the sheriff. All right, make it quick, okay? I don't like babysitting. The guests are here. What the fuck are they doing outside of the goddamn police station? Ah, thanks for taking us in tonight, Sheriff. Dale Elkins, Department of Corrections. Probably heard of me before. Couldn't leave you to drown out there, now could we? To tell you the truth, it might be better if some of them actually did. You know we don't have any food or enough holding cells? Radios and trial line's been in and outta service ever since the storm started. Gotta be honest with you, Elkins. I've had enough problems here tonight without having you here. Well, I guess we won't be feeding them after midnight. That's a movie reference. We'll try and be as painless as possible. Okay, I'm gonna go get the gremlins. Follow me. I can't fucking believe this. I say we just get the hell outta here. We ain't going nowhere, and neither are they. Our whole plan is fucked now. This doesn't make any sense. Yeah, well, we ain't turning back. All right, if you numb nuts couldn't tell, there's a raging storm going on out there. Roads are too dangerous to drive, and we wanna make sure y'all make it to your final destinations safe. So we prepared accommodations for y'all at the Lutree Sheriff's Department for tonight. You remember Yemen, right? I keep telling you, this storm, it works in our favor. And it's good for us. Take a look where we are. Yeah, outside of a goddamn police station in the middle of a fucking 50-year storm. I want you on your best behavior while we're here. Think of this as a... a field trip. For some of you, this'll be the last one you ever get. There gonna be ice cream? Banana split in this motherfucker. I like me chocolate. Shut the fuck up. laughing] This is our chance. This is our chance, and we are gonna bust on in there, and we are gonna get him out. Yeah, there's cops in there. Like we've never taken down no cops before if we had to. Can't be more than four or five of them on duty anyways. I don't think so. I mean, the prisoners came out. There's only two of them. If there was more, we would've seen them. You know, she's right. Here's what we're gonna do. When we're done, we're gonna ditch the truck. We're gonna meet at the rendezvous point on the jet skis as we planned. Then on, we can go our merry fucking ways. As long as this storm keeps falling like it is, don't think anybody's gonna stop us. All right. Single-file line, gentlemen. Act like you wanna be here. Do you wanna do the honors? -It's your ship. -Yeah, and it's sinking. All right. My name is Sheriff Newman. This is Deputy Whitlock. Welcome to the Lutree on this very wet and stormy day. Let's get a few things straight. You're in my house now. Settle down. Oh, shit, you settle down. Just letting you know you better be on your best behavior. Don't be fooled by the fact that I am a woman. My father was the sheriff in this town, and he taught me how to use a gun when I was four years old. I will not hesitate to shoot you if I have to. Please, by all means, fire away. Well... I'll be sure to aim right at that stupid thing on your forehead when I do. Ah. Right in the kisser. Fuck you, dark meat. I bet your mama like dark meat. What's your name, bullseye? Floyd McGraw. When I call your name, I need you to step forward. Big Jim Pruett? Yes, ma'am. How'd I guess? Well, I reckon it says they call me Big Jim in your file there, and I'm the-- I'm the second biggest one here. You reckoned right. Says you're looking at a nickel, drug charge, second offense. Well, you know what's trailer trash, ma'am. We only go for two things. Yeah, what's that? Cooking meth and growing weed. Okay, step back, Big Jim. Jonathan Apone. Who the fuck is that though? Look here, ma'am. I haven't heard that name in a long time. Where I'm from, everybody call me Jack Boy Jox, the neighborhood jacker. Only my mama call me Jonathan, unless you wanna be my White mama. How's your mama feel about her boy doing time in jail? Well, mama was just mad I got caught. I didn't make it home that night to pay that rent. My little brothers and sisters on the motherfucking street... evicted. Now, I'm in here with you White folks. Thank you, Jonathan. You can step back. Angelo Cooper, is it? That's correct. Step forward. Murder one. It's big. I got a big dick, too. You ever seen one? Not one this ugly. Step back. You're feisty. I like feisty. That must make you... Russell Cody, ma'am. That's a bonafide cop killer right there, Sheriff. Ain't that right, Russell Cody? Anybody kills a cop should burn, spend the rest of their time in hell as far as I'm concerned. Step back, Mr. Cody. All right. As you can see, it's a tight squeeze here tonight, and we're not food prepped, so this isn't gonna be fun for any of us. It's a bitch of a squall out there, so we're just gonna have to make the most of it until the morning. Understood? -Yes, ma'am. -Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. You sure got nice nails, Jox. I appreciate that there, boy. Feel good. My girlfriend told me to get one of those manicures you've got, but I don't know... Seems a little girly. Hey, y'all. Y'all don't think this is cruel and unusual right here? I can't even do my pushups. Oh, I'm sorry, baby, poor sweetheart. Why don't y'all just make yourselves comfortable, okay? We're gonna be here for a minute. Hope y'all can swim. What you think, Black people can't swim or something? Got our resident comedian in here, huh, Jox? Why don't you go sit your ass down? Yeah, let me out this cage and see what happens. I'mma tase your ass is what's gonna happen. All right. All right. It'll feel real good in this water, too. Okay, okay. Where the hell is Pine? Correction ain't seen nothing. Get down. Was that gunfire? No, that's probably just thunder. Oh, they popping off. They're definitely gunfire. Reminds me of goddamn Afghanistan. Goddammit, there ain't no signal. Yeah, sheriff said it's been that way since the storm started. What the hell have you two ass clowns gotten us into now? What the hell are you doing, Elkins? Don't do anything stupid. I'm gonna go check it out. I just said don't do anything stupid. He's right, Elkins. Listen to him. You stay here and watch them. Son of a bitch. Goddamn it. Clear. Watch your six. How many of you are still in here? Who the fuck are you? Well, it seems like you may have a little flooding problem in here today, Sheriff. It rains, it pours. Yes, it does. Besides yourself and the two guards that were on the bus, how many others are still here? And don't lie to me. It's just us. Okay, then, then this is what we're gonna do. You're gonna toss out your weapons, and you're gonna come out from behind there nice and slowly. That's what we're gonna do. How do I know you're not gonna shoot us? Well... Freeze. I told you not to lie to me, Sheriff. All right, we're coming out. There you go. Come on, nice and easy. Put the gun down right there. You, too, put it down, down. Kick it. Step back. -You okay, man? -Do I freaking look okay to you? Any more shit like that, and both of you will be dead. Do you understand me? Do you understand that, Deputy Sugar? I understood, we don't want any problems. The prisoners who were dropped here off the bus, where are they? Don't you run on me, Sheriff. To the back... back door. That's good. You're gonna guide us back there nice and easy. Then, you're gonna take us to the cell of one they call Russell Cody. You got that? -Got it. -Good. Nate, bandage him up. Keep an eye on the back door. Well, those boots were made for walking, right, Sheriff? Let's walk. You should probably go check on your boy, don't you think, man? I'm here watching y'all. Yeah, you watching us, but we ain't the ones getting shot at. There's a change for your Black ass, huh? You do know the Nazis lost the war, you White redneck, hillbilly, inbred piece of shit? Not in here, boy. Look at all the White faces. Who the fuck you calling a boy? You. Shut the fuck up! What the hell's going on up there, Sheriff? Put the gun down, Stamper. Where the hell is Elkins? Put the fucking gun down. Put the gun down. Put it down. Let me figure it out for you, ace. You're outnumbered. You're outgunned. You put it down or you don't, but there's only one outcome that keeps you breathing. There you go, nice and easy. There you go. And that one, too. Very good, very slow. Up you get. Step back. I said step back. Hell, yeah, that's the fuck I'm talking about. Let us out of this cage, White brother. Hey, dawg, gimme -that gun right there. -Hey. Pass me that right there, dawg. -I got your back. -Hey. I got your back, dawg. You were someone's White baby once. Hey. What the hell you doing here, Rafe? Howdy, Cody. Didn't expect on seeing us, now, did you? Sheriff? Me and you have got a lot of catching up to do. Omar's getting pretty bad out there. We got him. Now let's go. We can help you. Hey, my man, I can stop the bleeding for him. -We can help you. -Nobody's going nowhere. Fuck your problem? Surveillance cameras, where are they? -The cameras are broken. -Don't bullshit me, Sheriff. She ain't lying. Rats ate the wire. Kid you not. I don't care. I wanna see for myself. He's right. Where are they? In the storage room. Move, storage room it is. You, get the fuck in there. Go. Lock him up. Move it. Welcome to the Lutree Hotel and Spa. Fresh meat. Oh, shit. What? Nothing, I was just thinking. About? Your face. I don't know. We kinda look alike. Makes me think what I coulda done. I coulda been a cop, probably a pretty good one, too. But I guess that's what happens when one grows up in a good family, reassurance, a little confidence. You're gonna blame your upbringing? Heard that one before. What, you got daddy issues? You have no idea how my daddy broke my heart. But someone like you wouldn't understand that now, would you? You have absolutely no idea what I'm capable of, so you better shut your fucking mouth before it gets you into trouble. You don't have to do this. Yeah, sorry, babe. Rafe ain't leaving here until he gets what he wants. And when he does, I'm walking outta here. Move the fuck. Let's go. I know what you guys are doing here, Rafe. It's not gonna work. You should get outta here while you still can. What... What I had planned? Well, you know exactly what I'm doing here, and that sounds like a threat to me, Cody. Think of it however you want, but look outside... it's not me you should be worried about. But you see, it is you I'm worried about. We come all this way, and we went through all this to break you outta here, and that's exactly what we're gonna do. Elkins is dead? Sorry. I know it ain't easy losing one of your own. We gotta do something. What the hell? Somebody needs to get a damn plumber in here. Shit. Okay, let's go, move. You seriously wanna go there? Yeah. Looks like Atlantis in here. Come on, let's go. -Wait. Look. -Move. See those wires? It's a surveillance camera. Clearly, it's not working. Whose jacket is that? It's mine. All right, let's go. Wait. Do you see that? - What? - Flashlight. So? So, we need to go check it out. Oh, now you wanna go down there. You wanna have a wet T-shirt contest, too? I'm not gonna do anything. I just need to check it. Okay, well don't try anything funny. -I'm right behind your ass. -I'm not. -You hear that? -What? I don't hear anything. Holy fuck. Jesus fucking Christ. Stop shooting. The tank... the tank, stop. Oh, shit. That ain't gonna work in here. Ain't no service. Keep an eye on him. This could be our chance right here. Chance for what? We're locked in here. Where's Carter? In there. Alligators? How'd you know? Shit. Hey, boss, please don't leave us in here to drown with the pigs. If it was up to me, I wouldn't be here right now. Me neither, bruh. Please let us out. We gotta do something. Open the door. -Open the fucking door! -Where's Rafe? Open! Open the door. What the hell's going on out there? Goddamn, man! Hey, close that door! Fuck! Fuck, don't let me go! Close the fucking door! Don't you let me go! No! Close the fucking door now! Oh, shit. - Back up! - All right. Back up! Better do what he says, Sheriff. What are you doing? I kill her... we kill them. Oh-oh. No witnesses. Oh, man. Oh! Damn, you gonna hurt a lady, huh? Hey, get your hands off her, man. Oh, shit! Get him! - Get off her, man! - Oh! - Yeah, kick his ass! - Woo! Kick his ass! Oh, shit! Yeah, ooh! Oh, shit! Never seen a fight like that there. Just stay right there, sweetheart. I'll be right with you. Boys, boys, take a minute. I'll be done with her real quick, at least I hope so. So just chill-out. Oh, wow, look at you. You ready to start our little dance, sweetheart? Are you ready? Oh, my gosh, lady. Listen, I'm sorry to hit you, lady. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I told my mama I wasn't gonna hit no more girls, 'cause you were too pretty. Oh, what do you got there? Oh, I knew she was kinky. Let's dance. Go on now, girl, I got you. I'm gonna put a bullet right in their fucking head! You drop them, I'm gonna drop you. It'll make the whole world a lot safer. Why are you doing this, man? I thought you were with us. I was never with you. Nate, lower your gun. We got a bigger problem we have to deal with right now. Yeah, like how the fuck a crocodile get in here? That wasn't no crocodile, brother. This is Louisiana, that was a gator. Crocodiles are greener. Yeah, well how the fuck a big-ass gator get in here? Lower your weapons. Look, I'll give you what you want. That's why you came here, right? I never even wanted to be here. Now, things back the way they should be. Get back. I told you, get back! Sheriff, can you please tell me how a alligator got in your goddamn police station? -He's not alone. -What? You're shitting me. There's at least four. Two got Carter in the storage room, and another two out here got pretty boy. Omar? What's left of him. Shit. Storm brought 'em in. After Hurricane Ida, my sister's husband got eaten right in front of her in the front lawn. It was two weeks before they found what was left of him, inside of a 500-pound gator's belly. Storm like Ida, and this one right here, don't just displace people. Yeah. Push all kinds of gators and wildlife into buildings, just like this. And they get desperate, just like us. Yeah, we're up to our assholes in alligators. -Jesus. -This motherfucker. Too soon? We've got a real situation here. Who the hell put you in charge, inmate? Nobody. He's all right. He ain't all right, he's a goddamn cop killer. Been watching him this whole time, trust him. For the last 15 fucking minutes? Yes, sir. Famous last words, Deputy Dipshit. We gotta get outta here. Where are you gonna go? The whole town's flooded. It's dangerous outside, there's nowhere to go. Omar, Rafe, and Carter are dead. We just gotta get the fuck outta here. Yeah, and how're you gonna do that? We have jet skis outside waiting. Oh, that's what's up, man. Let's go get 'em. Just two! I hate to piss on everybody's birthday cake, but maybe you forgetting about what happened to his boss right there. I ain't going out that door with a big fucking gator out there. I ain't afraid of no fucking alligator. Well, you should be. It don't matter how big, or how strong you are. Those things out there been eating shit bigger than you and me since the dinosaurs was here. And I've been tangling with 'em out there in the swamps since I was knee-high to a crawfish. Shit, this whole station could be infested with 'em by now. We gotta get outta here. This whole place is flooded. We're gonna be swimming soon. Man, fuck this shit, dawg. We deep in gator shit. People from the ghetto ain't supposed to die like this. So what's the plan, Sheriff? -We're gonna go up. -Up where? There's two other levels. We're gonna go to the top and sit it out. Those other levels ain't safe. You got a better idea? You're the sheriff, Sheriff. Any one of you geniuses wanna tell me how we're getting up there? If you want to survive the night, we're gonna have to find a way to get along. As unpleasant as that might be. Man, fuck this. You wish. Yeah, I ain't working with these assholes. Well, it's time to make a decision. All right, we're good. - Okay. - Okay. All right. All right, let's go. I don't wanna be last. Man, that thing high up there, man. He's right. -All right. -Let's go. You heard her. This is bullshit. Get your Sasquatch ass up there, man. Fuck you, Thug Life. Knock it off, let's go! I'll race you to them jet skis. Bet. Move, move, move, move, move! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Come on, climb, motherfucker! Come on now, I made it up here, so can you! All right, hurry up, let's go! Jox, you're up next. Get your ass up there. All right, man. -I'm coming right up. -What the fuck? I can't go up? I'm sick and tired of being gator bait down here in this motherfucker. You got the goddamn mark of the beast on your forehead. Are you fucking serious? This is discrimination. Discrimination, my ass. Tell it to the judge. What are you waiting for? Hey, man, I was thinking, why don't you go up there first? I don't quite trust that weight. I'll hold it down down here. I'll show you how it's done. Goddamn. Yeah. Goddamn. Let's go, let's go! Yeah, I'm okay, I just got this little thing with heights. Anybody but me curious about how that door got open down there? -Everyone, out! -Hold on, what? The door behind you! - Hurry, hurry, hurry! - Damn! No, no, the splashing draws 'em! Come on, man! Let's go, let's go! Get up there, Nate. Get up there, Nate. Go, go, go, move, move, move! Take this. -Up here, now! -Come on, man! Hurry, hurry, hurry, let's go! Oh, fuck! -Come up! -Come on, man! Floyd, move, move, move! Help me, brother. Give me your hand, please! Give me your hand, I need help. You need some help? Yes, please! Thanks. Thanks. Help me, man, I don't wanna die here. I've got you. Okay. Yeah. Oh, fuck. Oh, goddamn it. Oh, fuck. Move, move, move! Hang on, move! Lord have mercy, did you see the size of that thing? That was one big son of a bitch. Not bad there, Deputy. I hear they taste like chicken. I never heard that. Got you! Fuck! - Goddamn! - Gators, man. We're all gonna get fucking eaten alive. It's not your fault. Let's keep moving. Wait, wait, I think we can get through here. All right, let's go. I'mma sue the shit outta the state for mistreatment. Good luck with that. Motherfucking bugs, no food, no water we can actually drink, and now we got man-eating gators. And if y'all didn't know, niggas and gators don't get along. At least we know how the water's getting in. There's so many leaks in this ceiling. This whole place is like a house of cards. That's just great. This day just gets better and better. Okay, guys, you know what? Just wait here a second, I need to think. I don't know about you fuckers, but I'm breaking myself out of this bitch as soon as I get the chance. Oh, yeah? You bet your ass. All we gotta do is take out these two bitches, and we gone. Ghosts. How many rounds do you got left? I got two in the shotgun, and I got nine, maybe ten in the sidearm. Okay. I'm gonna have to go upstairs, see what's up there. Just how exactly do you plan on getting out of town, huh? You don't strike me as an Olympic swimmer. Homeboy over here has got the fucking jet skis. - If they even still there. - Shh. In case you ain't forgot, there's a storm raging outside. They'll be there. Forgive me if I don't share your enthusiasm, but this little shit stain of a town gonna be crawling with police once the storm pass. Nah, sorry hoss. That's a fool's errand. You're the only fool that I see. Everyone here is looking at hard time, and I ain't going. What about you, Thug Life? I'm with you, big guy. I fuckin' hate jail. I think that's the point, friend. Sheriff said you killed someone, is that true? Why, you writing a book? Mm, just curious. Caught my old lady in bed with another dude. So you shot him? Not him... her. That's no way to treat a lady. Listen to you, cop killer. She ain't ever gonna love you, cop killer. All right, Cody, Jox, upstairs with me, let's go. What we going up there for? We need to check things out, let's go. Rest of you dick holes are staying here with me. Lucky us. How do alligators even get upstairs? Gators can climb. -No shit? -No shit. Watch your step. Goddamn, it's musty as shit up here, and cold as a motherfucker. I'll call the concierge. You gotta do something. No one's been up here for years, including me. What the hell we 'posed to find up here, lady? I don't know, find a weapon or something. Now, I like that, I can do that. Ain't found no weapons yet. I'm gonna keep on looking. So what's your story? Your friends that are trying to break you out of here? You don't seem like them, and they didn't like you very much. Must be something important to go through all of this. You know, I was in Afghanistan, way back, before everyone pulled out, that whole shit show? Got a dishonorable discharge for having an argument with my CO. Problem with authority. He gave me an order that I didn't sign up for. Unfortunately, our argument got a little physical. Oh, yeah, that's a big mistake. When I got back, I couldn't get a job. Turns out, there's not much work for a disgraced soldier. Yeah, but I still don't get the cop-killer thing. Did whatever I could to make money. I became a driver, delivering packages for certain types of people, that kind of thing. One day, I delivered this package to Rafe. He and I got to talking. Turns out, he and his gang, all ex-military, similar stories to mine. He offers me $20,000 to be getaway driver for this job where he guaranteed that no one would get hurt, no one. Got to them throwing these huge bags of money in the backseat of that car, but before they got in, cops showed up and Rafe turns on a dime, and shoots the first cop six times, dead to center. Rest of his gang take out the other two, and before they get in, I hit the pedal to the floor. So you drove off with the money? I sat there and debated for a while. I stashed the money, went to the rendezvous point where we were supposed to meet up if we got separated, only they weren't there. Somehow the cops showed up, and I got busted, and Rafe and them all got away. But you did the crime. Now I'm doing the time. "High performance protective coatings." I oughta use this as lubrication. I'm not a good man, far from it. It's the biggest mistake I've made in a long list of mistakes. But I like to think that you're right. About what? That I'm not like them. Fuck me. Shoot him. Wait. Hold. Wait, grab my gun. Grab it. Shoot! - Reloading. - Shoot this motherfucker! Goddamn! Shoot this motherfucker, please. Dear God! Cover me. Shoot this motherfucker! He's killing me! Shoot this motherfucker, please. I got a family! Get down! Wait, no! Whoo! Right there! No! Jet skis, let's go. You fucked up, Jim. Let's fucking go! Okay. Go on now. Let Big Jim take care of this. Hey there, beauty. You's a big one, ain't ya? Come on, now. Big Jim got something for ya. Yeah, come on now. Get outta here! Let me handle this. You didn't like that, did ya? Well, Big Jim got something for ya. Oh! Let's go. This one thought I was dead, and was saving me for later. Now I'm gonna make boots out of him. Can't believe I'm gonna say this, Rafe, but I'm really glad to see you. Protecting my investment. We've gotta move. We've gotta get to the jet skis if we're gonna make it outta here. You guys go, I'll be right behind you. No, we're not leaving you. Trust me, I've got a plan. You've got one shot, Sheriff. Hey. Here. We fucking did it, we did it. Let's go. What? What do you mean, what? Okay. I've got the fucking keys, man, let's go. We did it. I'm not leaving her. What did you say? Maybe you're not thinking straight. I've got the keys, we're leaving her, and we're going right now. Are you out of your fucking mind? I said, I'm not leaving her. Who said I'm leaving her? I'm gonna kill her. We have no choice. We have no choice. I won't let you kill another cop. Wait. Stop. Okay. Now, Cody, you know we can't. The county sheriff... she knows what we look like. She knows who we are. You've gotta let it go, it's over for us both. Do you get that? I won't leave her. Okay. Okay. Okay, I think you're right. We'll save the cop. Sorry, partner. Now, where are those damn jet skis? Are you gonna lock me back up now, huh? The way I see it... I got five dead convicts to report. Are you serious? Guess none of you were just badass enough to get through a dangerous storm with man-eating reptiles. I've been meaning to ask you something. Yeah, what's that? Your friends who stole the money, what'd they do with it? I'll be seeing you around, Sheriff.
