Hey, Scotties. What's up? Yeah, finally, it's your boy Great Scott. I know it's been awhile since I've made one of these videos. But don't worry, we do have a ton of game reviews and play throughs coming up, but I know that's not why you guys are here. You wanna know what happened, and well, you probably wanna know where I've been for the last three months, and I bet some of you think you had it figured out but You really won't believe the day that I had. ♪ One ring to voicemail ♪ ♪ Text me, babe, please ♪ ♪ If we talk in the morning ♪ ♪ I'll lose another night of sleep ♪ ♪ You and I got in our first fight ♪ ♪ Over something stupid ♪ ♪ I barely remember ♪ ♪ Let our heads get over our hearts ♪ ♪ And broke something beautiful ♪ ♪ But we can get back together ♪ ♪ Second time around is better ♪ ♪ If we can get it wrong ♪ ♪ We can get it right ♪ ♪ Tell me what's good ♪ ♪ And I'll see you tonight ♪ ♪ We can get back together ♪ ♪ Third time round forever ♪ ♪ If we can get it wrong ♪ ♪ Yeah we can get it right ♪ ♪ Tell me it's good and I'll see you tonight ♪ ♪ Yeah we can get back ♪ ♪ We can get back ♪ ♪ We can get back ♪ ♪ We can get back together ♪ ♪ We can get back ♪ ♪ We can get back ♪ ♪ We can get back ♪ ♪ We can get back together ♪ Oh, good morning, sunshine. Mm-hmm. I hope being up all night playing Dome Shots was worth it. Head Shots. Oh, Head Shots. 'Cause it was really cold last night and the only reason why I keep you around is to keep my feet warm, so. Well the review has to be done today, so. Well that doesn't keep my feet warm. Well, socks do. Oh. You know what? I should post this. Boom. I don't know why you play your game so late when you're here all day. Because I film videos throughout the day, Aly. Come on, you know this. Well, what I know is that it's not healthy to stay up so late. The average adult needs seven to nine hours of sleep a night to stay healthy. Mm-hmm, yeah. Well the average adult also doesn't run one of the biggest video game channels on the internet. So, you know, there's that. Oh, you're so special. What about frame rate? Okay, I'm leaving. You're an idiot. Oh, Scott, you know what? You're a douche bag, you know that? Um, so I was thinking- Kiss my ass. That after I get home tonight- Get out of here. We need to talk. Shut up! Oh my God! Well, why, why are you even here? Why are you even commenting? Do you know what? Screw you. This dickhead wrote that, "I bet he doesn't even have a girlfriend." Ha, yeah, real funny. This asshole, he just wrote in that he thinks that I don't even have a girlfriend. Girlfriend? Al? Wait, we need to talk? Double kill. Wow, she said that? Yup. That sucks. Yeah, not as much as you. Watch your left. Oh, got it. So what are you thinking? I don't know. I'll probably comment on it in my next video. Hashtag we need to talk. What? Oh, come on. It's great content. You know the fans love it when I talk about Aly. Don't you think you should ask Aly what she wants to talk about before you announce it to the entire world? Nah. It's probably just some comment about putting the toilet seat down or something. Speaking of, did you see the comments on last night's video? Yeah, I guess a few. I feel like you should be taking this more seriously. Which comment? The one about the octopus? 'Cause you know what? I totally agree. That one really weirded me out. No, we need to talk. About what? Dude, not me, not your social media, your social life. I think she's gonna tell you you have a little dick. Hi, Kyle. I can't wait. It's gonna be terrible. Asshole, what the- Oh, careful now, Kyle. You don't want your mommy to hear you speaking all nasty like that again, do you? Shut up, Great Snot. Is that what they teach you in school these days? More importantly, Kyle, why aren't you in school? I'm out today with allergies, bitch. So I'll be here crushing your KD all fucking day. Great. I hate to admit this, but Kyle might be onto something. Yeah, sure. Superhero bedsheets. Screw you Tit Dick. Kyle Sheldon! What did you just say? Nothing. It was some jerk on the game. - I'll mute him. - Hi, Moreen! You better, because if I hear talk like that again, young man- Oh, Kyle. My kids would never talk like that. I'm hungry. I want dino nuggets. Oh, sweetheart. You can't have dinosaur chicken nuggets for breakfast. Daddy's gonna make you waffles as soon as Daddy's game is over, okay? Goddamn prick! I'm fucking reporting him right fucking now. I'm gonna report you to Child Services. - Jesus. - They're fucking cheating. I know it. Sure. Can we circle back to Kyle's first ever lucid point? Okay, you know what, Joe? I can officially confirm that my girlfriend of 10 years is perfectly fine with the size of my joystick. Oh, well that's settled then. Seriously, it might be major. Oh, thank you. You know, I've always thought of my junk as slightly average, but major, wow! Not your junk! All I'm saying is there's nothing worse in the world than when someone says to you, "We need to talk." Are you sure? Because when she says, "Do you know what today is" that usually ends up in a pretty expensive same day delivery. Wow. Okay, look, you're worrying about absolutely nothing, all right? Let it go. They're spawning behind us. I'm just playing devil's advocate here. As your producer I wanna make sure that- Predator. You know I hate that so much. Okay, you are my video producer and editor. So ipso facto, you're a predator. Mm-mm. Ew. I knew you guys liked little boys. Fucking perverts. Oh, goody. Kyle's back. Why the whispering, bud? Shut up. I don't care how many subscribers you have. Your videos suck. Really? 'Cause I'm gonna be uploading a really super funny one today. Whatever. Nobody watches your old ass anymore. Really? 'Cause, you know, I just think, I think they're gonna really like this one. What are you doing? You fuck! Shit, dick, cock, assholes! No, stop! Kyle Sheldon! - Prick! Nuts! - That's it! You are done! No, no, no, Mom! No, Mom, I swear it wasn't me! It wasn't me! It was Scott! No, no! Woo, thank god his mom showed up. Honestly, guys, I was running out of bad words. That was amazing. That was wrong, bro. No, no, you know what's wrong? Is wasting the day reviewing Head Shots. Head Shot Heroes 10? - Yep. - Nice. I love the first one. Yeah, I played it all the time before we had- Kids! Yeah, no, I played it all the time back in college. You know, come to think of it, I really have no idea how I graduated. You did not graduate. Oh yeah. So, how's the new one? I don't know. Same shit. I'm almost done with it but it's, you know, it kinda just feels like it's- No, no, no, save it for the video. Can you finish playing the game so we can do the review before launch? If I have to. You have to. It's the biggest game of the year and it comes out tomorrow. You'll have to film it, edit it, and post it all today. So it'll go up around 10:00. This has been Joe signing off. Okay, hey, hold on one more second. Joe, Joe, Joe? What? You suck. Goddammit. I want dino nuggets. Yeah, let me feed the dweebs. I'll be on later if you wanna raid. Copy that. Good luck with the lady. Whatever. Go get on those dinosaur nuggets, Dad. Game begin. Okay. Controls feel okay. Boom, first head shot. Okay, looks kinda the same as it did before. This is the same exact level just backwards. Crushed it! Did it get easier or did I just get better? Wait, no one answer that out loud. I got better. Okay. Oh, look. An invisible wall. Working super hard. Look at his eyes. He looks so damn good. Yeah. So predictable. Pick a side. Come on, what are you waiting for? Come on, what are you waiting for? Take a shot. Oh, shit. You bathed. I feel special. And I'm gonna put on a new shirt. Ooh! A new shirt. Yep, this one's charcoal. Okay. A different color doesn't make it a new shirt. It still has your big ol' face on it. Yeah, well this big ol' face sells lots of t-shirts, all right, buddy? It's called branding and I need to do it. Well, if you didn't always feel the need to brand, Aly wouldn't need to talk. Okay, Steve Jobs, he wore the same shirt every single day, okay? You know why? Because it allowed him to free his mind and focus on bigger, more important issues. So, what should I order for lunch? Hmm, seems like it's working. What? You love... You know what? You're not getting any. And I'll ask the Scotties, okay, 'cause they adore me. What up, Scotties? It's your boy Great Scott. We about to get all up in this video. It's gonna be lit. Hey, there's Joe doin', I don't know, whatever the hell Joe does. Anyways, far more important, I'm starving. Let me know some restaurant recommendations in the city. And I'm out. Posted. Boom! So, how do you wanna do this Head Shots review? Wanna do like a skit like we did before? You toss on those army fatigues. You can even download some World War footage. Eh, you know what? I'll just let you know when I finish the game, okay? Dude. Have you seriously not finished the game? No. But I've almost finished the game, hmm? I'm on the last mission, come on. Well I don't wanna be cutting this all night long. All right, we gotta get this in the can. Okay, relax. I will get it in your can soon enough. But right now that's not what we're doing, okay? Mic me. Fine. What are we doing? Oh, ooh. Cold hand. Okay. What up, Scotties? It's your boy Great Scott with Great Scott Gamer. Now, serious talk. Sometimes our community can be just a little bit immature. So today I had the pleasure of teaching a valuable lesson to one of my younger fans about just how to communicate with your fellow teammates. Because you see, Great Scott is for the childrens. Yeah, yeah Great Scott Gamer is for the childrens and if you don't believe me, well then, check this out. Whatever. Nobody watches your old ass anymore. Really, 'cause I think, I think they're gonna really like this one. What are you doing? You fuck, dick, shits, tits, suck balls. Kyle Sheldon! That's it! You are done! No, no, no, Mom! I swear, it wasn't me, it wasn't me! It was Scott! No, no! Scott! Well, there you have it. You know, maybe next time Kyle will think before he speaks. And speaking of speaking, or is it talking of talking, this morning Aly, you know, my lovely lady and sugar mamma, said that we need to talk later on when she gets home. Now, should I be concerned? I don't know. Joe thinks so. But Joe's also afraid of plastic ware, so. Anyways, leave me your comments and your thoughts on that one and don't forget to like, subscribe, and comment. Love you guys! Catch you on the flip side. Your boy Great Scott Gamer. I'm out. Everything's set up for the review. How's that Kyle video doing? Yo, Scott. - Hey! - Hmm? Oh yeah, dude, everything's good. All right. I'm gonna go home, grab some lunch, come back. That should give you enough time for the review, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah, man. Do whatever you need. Yo, where are you right now? Is the edit okay? What? Yeah, dude, your edit's great. But the comments, man, they're all about Aly. Look. Man, I tried to tell you. Yeah, well you also tried to tell me that using a typewriter at Starbucks would be inspiring. Yeah, it was inspiring. It was great. Doubtful. So what are the comments saying? Man, okay, well, she's got a new sugar daddy. She's got a hairy navel. She's smooching another pickle. She's just not that into you. She's got erectile dysfunction. That doesn't make sense. She's out of your league. They wrote it. I don't think she's out of your league. Although, to clarify, are we talking major leagues or like a little league? Joseph. Since when do you even care about comments? Ever since I was ever given the attention I so desperately crave. Have you met me? True. But, dude, it's not even about the stupid comments. It's the fact that they even give a shit. I mean this, this Kyle gag is epic but all they care about is what my girlfriend had to say when she was walking out the door. And honestly, I didn't. Well, now you do. Call Aly up, find out what she wants to talk about. No, I'm not gonna do that. That's a stupid idea. I think I'm gonna go ahead and not call her because she might just forget she even said anything in the first place, right? Joseph, look at me. This is a good lesson for life. Oftentimes when there's a problem, the best thing to do is just ignore it and hope it goes away. Under what circumstances does that ever make sense? Global warming. Dude, your carbon footprint. We've talked about this all the time. - You have to reduce it. - Jesus, okay I get it. Don't go chain yourself to a tree. I'll call her. Great. Fine. Call her, finish your thing, I'll be back. Oh wait, Joe, Joe, Joe. Hey, Joe, buddy. We need to talk. About what? What should I order for lunch today? See, it's not a big deal. Those words don't mean anything. You are such a dick. See, the words aren't that bad, okay? It's not that scary. It is. Love you. Hate you. Mm-hmm, right. I'm not gonna call her. Hello? Yeah. Aly, yeah, no, no. Hey, no, hey, hey. I am the one doing the talking here, okay? Clearly- - Delivery. - Hello? - Hey, yeah, hey. Sorry about that. It's Scott. Yep, I'll do the chicken parm special. Mm-hmm, thank you very much. Aly, I am sorry, okay? I am so sorry. You know, whatever it is, I'm sorry, okay? I'm nothing without you and I'll keep your feet warm, okay, I swear. I promise I will keep your feet warm- Hello? Yes. Yes. Onion rings instead of fries. Same order as always. Come on, Mr. Lee. But what is talking, really, you know, besides, besides mouth just moving? We're like, ooh, we're like Jean Gray and Professor X. Hmm? Yeah. Ooh, how about Luke and Leia? We're like Jay and Bey. Yeah, she's gonna love that one. Jay and Bey. That's brilliant. Oh, shit, but he cheated on her. The whole lemonade thing. How to talk to your girlfriend. She needs to talk? So let her talk. Ooh, and you know what? I'll even try and listen. Better yet, how to listen to your girlfriend. That's what it is. I'm gonna try and listen. What, who does that? No, no, that's absurd. Hey, it's Aly. I can't take your call. Leave me a message. Shit. Best video game reviewer ever. Yo, Scott, I heard about that we need to talk stuff. That's actually not a bad photo of me. You know what? Focus. Hey, it's Aly. I can't take your call. Scott, man, it's Dubby, man. I heard about the chick. Hey, it is Scott, your boyfriend. I'll text. I will just text Aly. Uh, you know, just call me back when you get back. Hey, Scott. She always responds to texts. She'll get right back to me. It's gonna be moments. Huh? The last time I sent- Nope, just more comments on the video. A text message like that to somebody, things did not - go well for them. - I hope your feet are warm. - Um, bye. - Hey Scotty, I just saw that video about you and Aly. I'm sorry to hear that. But more importantly, did you get the I Shoot Raw shirt I sent you? Oh, come on. Yo Scott, what's up, man? Look, tell her you love her and start crying. What is wrong with these people? Don't any of them have jobs? Wait a minute. Aly has a job. Good morning. Weinreich & Associates. Hey there, Melissa. It's Scott. Is Aly around? Oh, hey Scott. No, she's presenting in the conference room. Do you want her voicemail? Nope, nope. I am good. Just, you know, let her know I called. Will do. Have a great day. What the fuck? All right, I mean, you know, you gotta admit that I did try and make a little bit of an effort to talk to her and, seriously, in my defense, I had a ton on my plate. Please tell me you finished up Head Shots. Nope. But go ahead and eat your cage-free tofu or whatever shit you order for lunch and relax, okay? It'll take me 30 minutes tops. Dude, it's my job to make sure the review goes up on time. Oh yeah? Is it also your job to push too far and see? 'Cause well, guess what? They're spawning behind us, dickhead. Where? Right side. Check your radar. I got 'em. Oh, shit. My bad, bro. I got this. Damn, bro. You went ham on it. Victory. Hey, hold on, real quick. Back out. My girl wanna join. Okay. So you talked to her? Hell yeah. All the time. Not you. Scott. Oh, that's right. You got all that we need to talk shit going down. What's up with that anyway? Let's see. I called her, left a message, texted her, no response, called her work. She was in a meeting. And you believed that? Well, I did right until you said that. Look, man, I'm just trying to keep it 100 with you. She might not even be at work. She might be out in these streets. Okay, Tango, you know what? She's not out in these streets. So, you can stop that right there. Did you check these streets? Okay, she's not out in these streets. Yeah, okay. You don't gotta try to convince me 'cause I know where my lady is. Hello, lads. Hey, gorgeous. Hello, dear heart. How is everyone, yeah? Wait, Tango. I thought you said your girlfriend was from Canada. Hell no. They ain't got no morals. Lady Fingers is classy. She's British. Yeah, yeah. I didn't get that. So how'd you two meet? Oh, we never met before. She just my little gamer boo for now. Aww. Are you gonna send her dick pics? I really, really need to block you. Whatever, bitch. Careful, Kyle. Scott'll make your little ass famous again. Screw you, Tango. And my mom went to the store. Where's yours? I told your ass I pay rent and they my roommates. Plus, there's a great recession. Yeah, like 10 years ago. Three, two, one. Dominate. Scott, hurry up and kick this asshole off the game. Too late. Hey, Scotty, what did you lady need to talk to you about? Well, I haven't talked to her yet. So well, no updates. Oh, well I'm sure it's nothing, love. Really? You know, I sure really appreciate you saying that because that's what I was thinking that this whole thing is probably nothing. I actually feel a lot- - Yeah, sorry. I don't really think it's nothing. I was just being polite. Great. Thank you. I'm marking enemies on the radar. Girl, you our own personal GPS. With PMS, you tossers. Oh shit, that's it. What? You got your period too? Yeah. We'll see who's in these streets now, huh? All right. I swear, if we lose because of you- Please tell me you'll quit this game right now. Screw you. At least I had a girlfriend in his country. Whoa, Kyle. You are seriously asking us to take a leap of faith right there. Yeah, sticking your dick in couch cushions doesn't make that your girlfriend. But it does make it a Seaman's Furniture. Oh! And right there was a tribe called quest reference, Kyle, but you were probably a dead pool when that one dropped. Hey, man, rest in peace the fight, though. And Kyle, did you say had? Wow, and you're worried about me getting dumped? Watch your right, Kyle. Oh! Game over. Victory! Kyle? Kyle, are you crying? Well, that went bad. Oh no. Damn you little bitch. You blokes are awful. Whatever, I'll send him a t-shirt. He'll be fine. Oh yeah, that'll make it tons better. Maybe you should tweet about it. I mean, I did record it, so. Bollocks, don't you dare. Nah, do that shit, do it, do it! Hey guys, I, I gotta jump. You better be jumping into that Head Shots review. Okay, all right. Hey, beautiful. There you are. Yeah, here I am. That'll be 13.50. Yeah, sorry. I thought that you were- Aly? Yeah, you know that we need to talk stuff? It never works out. Thank you. Yeah, no, I've heard at this point. Thank you very much. Here you go, go ahead and just keep the change. I'll take this and, uh, buh-bye. Hey, man, I am free later if you would like to- Come on. So, good luck! Aly? Oh god. She is in these streets. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, Aly. Come on. Aly! Aly! Hey, do you need my help? No? I'm gonna find you. She's right here. Aly? Hey, Al. Come on, Al. Pick up. Pick up. Hey, it's Aly. I can't take your call. Leave me a message. Oh, come on. Great. Weinreich & Associates. Oh hey, it's Scott again. Hey, has Aly had a chance to, like, come up for air or anything yet? Uh, yes she did but she ran out again. Oh, okay, okay, because she left her- Left her phone, I know. She told me to tell you that she would call you later. Okay, cool. Is she off to like another meeting or something? No, a doctor's appointment. Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, of course. The doctor's appointment for today. All right, no problem. Thanks so much. Bye. Doctor's appointment? She didn't tell me about any doctor's appointment. Did she? Maybe she did. Nope, nope, I am pretty sure that she didn't. Shit, she probably did. Boo-yah. Dr. Covington's office. Yeah, this is Scott Stewart. I am Aly Fulton's boyfriend. Is she there? Uh, who's this? It's Great Scott. Scott Stewart. Are you a patient of Doctor Covington's? No, no, no, I am not. But my girlfriend, Aly Fulton is and I think that she's there. So, is she there? You think your girlfriend is here? Yes. Is she there? Okay, I'm not allowed to give out patient information to anyone but spouses and immediate family members, so- Okay, you know, I know this is probably gonna sound super creepy, stalker, even restraining order, but seriously, I really do need to talk to her. So if you wouldn't mind, just, you know, putting her on the phone if she happens to be, I don't know, sitting right in front of you. Sir, I'm sorry. That's against the rules. Have a nice day. Wait, no, no, no, wait, don't hang up. Okay, please just let me explain, okay? This morning, before she left, she said "We need to talk." Yeah, okay? And I wasn't paying attention and well, she left her cell phone here. So look, I'm just trying to find her so that we can talk and- Yeah, that's trouble. Good luck. Thank you. She probably has teeth in her crotch. Of course she does. They all do. What? Watch your left. It's probably just her lady doctor visit. Yeah, that's what I was guessing. So they can check if your dong is too small for girls. That is not what I was guessing, Kyle. Please watch your right. Seriously? That's all you're guessing? Well, I was, but I guess you have a different guess, I'm guessing. Oh, for the love of God, man. I'm pretty sure my wife came to me one day and said, "Hun, we need to talk", and boom, two kids later, I'm Captain Stay-at-home Dad making dino nuggets. Dino nuggets! Dino nuggets! Dino nuggets! Yeah, seriously, Scott, you never thought that she might be pregnant? Oh, Scotty. Congratulations. A baby by Scott will be a millionaire. Okay, thanks, but not necessary, all right, because that is not possible. Because you have no penis. No, because she's on the pill, Kyle. Yeah, penis pills. No, birth control pills. God! Oh, so you leave it up to the woman to be the responsible one. Typical rubbish. No, no, not like that. I never like- I'm joking, love. Well, not really. But you do know it's really easy to forget to take those little buggers every day. Yeah, I forget to put deodorant on all the time. What's happening? Silas, apologize to your sister, okay. I'm not gonna say it again. Silas, relax. Guys, I'm gonna use the restroom real quick. Player one or player two? Finish Head Shots. Yep, I'm doing it right now. Guys! What do birth control pills even look like? There's no way that she's pregnant. All right, you know, she's not forgetful, first of all, and she would've said something. No, she definitely would've said something. And I would've definitely heard that. Like I'm pretty sure I would've heard something like that. ♪ I got up to drive till dawn ♪ ♪ And you're gone, gone, gone ♪ ♪ Are you going ♪ ♪ Won't you stay ♪ ♪ On second thought, it's okay ♪ ♪ I'm at the border of control ♪ Where is your teammate, little man? ♪ So you wanna fall hard ♪ ♪ Fall hard, hard, hard ♪ ♪ You're dying to make some art ♪ ♪ And you're so smart ♪ Yes! ♪ All I hear is talk, talk, talk, talk ♪ ♪ Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk ♪ ♪ All I hear is talk, talk, talk, talk ♪ ♪ Talk, talk, talk, talk ♪ ♪ Talk, talk, talk ♪ An extra life. ♪ Talk, talk, talk ♪ Yay.

The point is, would I like to have a family with Aly? Weinreich & Associates. Hi, Scott. Yes, she did come back from the doctor. Great. Can I talk to her? No, she got pulled into one of the labs. Had to put out a fire. Oh, not like a, not like a real fire with flames or anything like that. Like not an emergency kind of thing. Is your thing an emergency? I can try to get her if it's an emergency. Is it an emergency? Uh, nope. No, not, not an emergency. Just let her know I called again. Yeah, thanks. Scott, it's Kendall. - Dude, I heard about Aly. - Hey Scott. - That's terrible, man. - I'm really sorry to hear about you and Aly. She's definitely out - meeting other guys. - If you ever need some advice - or someone to talk to. - Getting drunk right now. So like, we should go do - the same thing. - Just know I'm always free. But, meet other girls. Picking a name. That's a huge commitment, boy. It's like picking a gamer tag. Look at mine. Joe Joe Joe. Simple, easy to remember, and it's not embarrassing to tell people in mixed company. Flanking right. Look, man, on some real shit, Tango_Unchained wasn't my first name. I was 15 when I got my first system and I thought the name Boob Shooter was hilarious until last year when my boss got his kids their first console and he asked me my name. Oh no. Did you tell him? Hell yeah I told him but I never heard from his kids, so it was all good. Although he did ask me out for drinks from time to time. Okay guys, I'm not picking a name. I'm still trying to figure out why she didn't tell me. She did say "We need to talk." Yeah, I guess so. They're capturing B. That's a game changer. Not really, we've controlled the B and C points like the entire game. We're good. Not the game. The pregnancy. Right, yeah. I guess, but, you know, how reliable are those little test things, anyway? Give it back! Oh, they're fucking accurate. Give it back! Silas, give her back the toy, please. Goddamn it! Who's got the A point? It's okay. I got it under control. I hope so. It's just like this Head Shots review. You can't avoid it and think it's just gonna go away. Okay thanks, Dad. But I'm trying here, okay? What am I supposed to do? Put it on Facebook so the whole world can see it? I mean, her dad is literally just looking for a reason to choke me out and all of her friends are terrible. Double kill! Speak of the devil. So you'll talk about it in a video post with a bunch of total strangers. Okay, that's different. They're not strangers. They're my fans. Mm. Man, it sound like you got more love for them. Oh yeah, okay, this is coming from the guy whose girlfriend is entirely across the Atlantic. All right, now. Let's don't be cheeky. He's just trying to help. You're right. I'm sorry. I just... I just don't know what else to do, guys. Well, if I had any serious problems, I would tell my girlfriend. No, yeah. Not gonna happen. Her best friend hates me, first of all. Oh, and second of all, dealing with her is like dealing with the red witch at the red wedding. Death and crotch demons. Come on, man, spoilers! Stop doing that shit. Honestly, Scott, I think her mate would appreciate that you care enough for Aly to ask her. So ask her. Uh, no. Look, even if I wanted to, like, there's no way that she would talk to me. Oh, it can't be that bad. Oh yeah? Last time I saw her, she hit me with a bicycle. I mean, there's just no way she's gonna talk to me. A secure. But she will talk to Aly. Lost the lead. Hey Amber, I really need to talk to you. Come over. Right away. All right. C secure. Oh my... Oh, what the shit? Aly? Aly? Yeah, sure, just come on in. Aly? She's not here. Bitch. Well, where did she go? She told me to come over. No, I asked you to come over. Okay, weirdo, fuck this, deuces. You know, I always knew you were hot for me, Scott, but this is pathetic, seriously. Okay, Amber, seriously shut up. That's not what I want. Look, Scott, we couldn't even if I wanted to because I'm on my period and I don't even know you like that, so. Amber, that's so gross. Fine, so bossy. But get behind me. I don't wanna have to look at both your stupid faces. I just wanna talk about Aly. Oh, gross, no. You really are into some kinky ass weird shit, Scott. Okay, Amber, stop, okay? Seriously, I need to talk about Aly. No sex. Just talk. Yeah, of course. I mean, I knew that. This was all a test and you passed with flying colors. So high five. Yay, go you. So how long have you known? Oh my God. You're such a dork. That's not Aly's. Wait, so Aly's not- Oh God, no. So you're- Oh, fuck no. - So you hadn't- - Oh, gross, no! Our friend Mary got knocked up. She came over to do the test, duh. Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot that I live at Planned Parenthood. Yeah, that's my bad. Ha-ha, fuck you. Is that it? Seriously, how would I possibly know that? Oh my God. Scott, you were here when we did the test. Maybe if your head wasn't so far up Pac-Man's ass all the time, you would know that. Look, I get it. I need to pay more attention, okay? But Aly left her cell phone here, I can't get her at the office and, I have no idea why she thinks that we need to talk. Oh, shit. She said, "We need to talk"? Yes. Damn! You're toast! Oh my God. I'll tell you what, though, it is about fucking time. I've been telling her to kick your ass to the curb for years. You know what, whatever Amber. You can go. And you know what? For the record, Pac-Man doesn't even have a butt. So, you're stupid. Jesus Christ, Scott. Whatever you wanna talk about or ask, I will give you one cigarette's time to do it. Who said you could smoke in my... If Aly's not pregnant, why is she at the doctor? Oh my God. She's probably at the crotch doc, Scott. How do you not know that either? I don't know, okay? I'm an insensitive asshole, I get it. Jesus, Amber, okay. Do you have any idea why she thinks that we need to talk? Nope. Awesome, thank you, this was a great idea, yeah. Look, I don't know, but if I were to guess, I would say it's about the state of the union. That's it, yeah. It's the president's fault. Oh my God, Scott. I am talking about the two of you. Amber. Seriously, has she said anything to you, like you know about, I don't know, us not working or- Scott, you would know if it's working. How is your relationship? What do you mean? It's great. Like the same it's been for the last 10 years. Is it? Okay, what did you guys talk about last night? Oh my God. I don't know, you know, dinner probably. Okay. When's the last time you guys went out? Like last week, month. Last week, month? Is that a short month like February? What did you guys do? We went to dinner, you know, because they wouldn't, they wouldn't deliver. So romantic. Well, in my professional opinion, you sound more like roommates than a couple. And on that note, peace. Scott, I know you think that this whole world revolves around you and that YouTube shit and I'm sure you get showered with, like, hell a nerd love all the time but you gotta understand Aly doesn't have that. So when it comes to getting showered with love, all she has is you. Drop the mic. Boom. You know, why'd she wanna get showered with you by anything is beyond me. - Oh my god. Oh my God. - Okay, you know what? Goodbye, Amber. I just pictured you showering. Oh! Oh my god. Hey, Scott! I need money for the bus! Look, I was gonna let you tap that ass. The least you can do is reimburse me for travel, Scott! - Asshole! - Fine, here you go. Ooh, 20 dollars. - YouTube make a lot of money. - On your way. - Hi! - Um, hey. Do we need to talk? Oh my god. Oh, it smells like not sex. So you're not banging your pregnant girlfriend's best friend? Nope. No friend banging. Aly not pregnant. Flawless victory. Cool, so... No way. Are you seriously still playing the game? You didn't finish? Okay, don't get your panties in a twist. I am finishing it right now. So run along and grab your camera and we can film your little video because that is what you want. I mean, I guess. It's not really what I want. It's about what the fans want. Yeah, sure it is. Dude, you made a commitment to them. Did I? 'Cause I remember that I just wanted to play video games and make money. You wanted to turn it into this big Hollywood production. Oh, right. Sorry. You know what, sorry for making your videos not suck. And I guess it's also my fault that you haven't finished playing a game that you've had for an entire month, right? That's on me. Yeah, well apparently, it's either yours or the president's, but I'm pretty sure that it makes more sense that it is yours, yeah. I'm just trying to keep it fresh, okay? We can't keep doing the same videos year after year. Why not? I mean, honestly, they're gonna forget about this, this stupid Head Shots review the day after you post it. I mean, just like I can't even remember what I had for dinner last night. So, frankly, what's the difference? I just don't want them to get bored and go somewhere else. Yeah, right. Where else is she gonna go? Who? Like any of those other stupid channels. No, you said, "Where's she gonna go?" She who? No, no I didn't. Yeah, you did. Okay, you know what? I should just live stream this shit right now and be done with it. Look, people like the skits. People like the in-depth review videos. They think they're cool. I think they're cool. Yeah, well they also thought it was cool when I was just gaming in my dorm room. I mean, honestly, if I wasn't wasting all this extra time filming all of your extra bullshit, Aly would probably be cool and not trying to talk to me about whatever the fuck. No, nope. There's no way you're gonna pin whatever's going on between you and Aly on me. - No. - No, no, think about it. Seriously, I mean, if I just kind of did what I did before, I would have time at night to, I don't know, hang out with my girlfriend. You could do that now and finish during the day but you choose not to. Well, you can't argue that I would save a shit ton of money if I was just live streaming. I wouldn't have to pay my predator the big bucks. Wow. Come on, dude. I was joking. Well, the thing about jokes is that they're actually supposed to be funny. I would make double doing what I do for you doing, I don't know, like weddings or something, but I choose not to do that because I feel like we're doing something different. We are, Joe, we are. We are doing something different. But you don't want to. I'm not gonna beg you to be better. Okay, fine, fine, fine, I get it. All right. You're upset. But you know what? You can just get on in line behind everybody else. But what I will do for you is I'm gonna, I'm gonna go ahead and finish this game so you can do your stupid little review. Okay, buddy? Would you let me? Would you please be so kind and let me bust my ass making something you don't even appreciate? Wow. Thank you, Great Scott. We are so blessed that you even exist in our lives. Me, the fans, shit, even Aly should be counting her blessings because maybe if she plays her cards right, and I'm only spit balling here, but maybe you might order dinner from a new place tonight. Such a lucky girl. Go fuck yourself, man. Sure. Run to the internet. Oh yeah, because you have, what, half a million friends on your Great Scott page. How many do you have on your personal page, huh? Like, whew, 14? Your mom, Aly, her friends, me. Yeah well, it pays the bills. Yeah, well I'm sure if you would call the bank the would say you're rich, of course. But, dude if you... If you just invested in your real life more, you'd be way richer. Wow. That typewriter is really paying off, huh? If you feel like doing anything more for the people who actually give a fuck about you, it's all set up back there. I guess we needed to talk after all. Yes, I know, I know I was wrong, okay? I'm the first to admit it now. Total tool for that one. Yeah. But it's... You know, it's tough to get called out on your bullshit. Especially when you know they're right. I guess we really did need to talk. Well, you know what? I will give you something to talk about. Oh and would you look at that? I have 23 friends on my personal page. So, blow me. Okay, about to live stream Head Shot Heroes 10. Boom. Okay, taking it back to the old school. Huh. What up, Scotties? It's your boy Scott with Great Scott Gamer coming to you live and direct. Okay, so let's get right to it. Head Shot Heroes 10. Now, all anybody really wants to know is was it any good. All right, so I thought instead of making you wait for some boring review, that we would find out together, huh? What is this? Is the review out? This is great, right? I mean, why wait around for a review? This is boring. Did you review it yet? All right, guys, so this is the 10th game in a series. So, you know, everything feels pretty familiar, no surprises so far. No surprises. Just like your channel. Are you just live streaming now? All right, guys, so I thought I'd mix it up, keep it fresh, and try out this live streaming, which is so much better than a regular review. It's like an instant review, huh? Like why go all the way across town to eat at that one restaurant when you can just order the food right to your front door? Bon a pet it. I only watch play throughs if the game is good. Is it any good? Okay, some good questions coming in. Uh, is the game good? Will it live up to the classics? Stop being lazy and just finish the review. I saw you post about it. Review it. All right, guys, so, you know, this is just the beginning. We all know these games start a little bit slow. - Boring. I'm out of here. - Oh my god, Scott. Epic fail! Okay, uh,. Oh great, great, great, here we go! Our first fire fight. Finally some action. This is great, you know? This is like reviews on demand. Kind of like I always tell Aly, why waste time and money going out to see a movie and pay for those overpriced snacks when you can just wait and then watch it right at home? I mean, it's so much better, right? Better or just easier for you? Thanks for the effort, dick. Unsubscribed. Shit. Wow, you must be a super fun boyfriend. Fun, fun, fun factor, right? What's the fun factor like? Poor Aly. No wonder she needs to talk. - Uh-oh, you're losing 'em. - Get it under control. Uh, you know, the controls, the controls feel tight, you know, good, as always. No surprise there. That's what she said, right Aly? Okay guys, guys, look, look, just stay with me, okay? There is tons of great stuff coming up. Oh great, don't review it. Just spoil it for us. No, guys, guys, hang on, all right? I've almost finished the game. So, trust me, I'll warn you of any spoilers. You almost finished the game? Then do the review. Guys, I just thought that we'd, like, you know, we'd do it together. You know- - Great, let's sit here and watch you do your job. No, no, no, that's not what I meant. I thought that- Man, I'm a long time subscriber. You used to care about this stuff. Guys, guys, I obviously do care, okay? I am right here, aren't I? You're here? Where else would you be? He'd be managing a Game Stop. You know what, look. We'll finish the review tonight and- Seriously, I didn't subscribe to this. I'm out of here. Unsubscribed. Guys. You know what? Shit. Just turn off. Fuck, why won't you... Jesus. Where the fuck is the off button? Shit. All right, look, I'll give you 20 for the trade in, but the used game you want costs 30. So you owe me 10. But Mr. Frank, I only have five dollars. Please? Spencer, the game costs me 30. You want me to lose money on the deal? No. But what if I fix the games on the shelf for you again? Fine. But alphabetical this time, not based on the ones that you think are best to worst. It's not like you're... Great Scott. Great Scott? Hey guys. What's up? Oh my gosh. Great Scott, you're my favorite. Can I get a picture? Yeah, yeah we can make that happen. Scott, I'm sorry about your girlfriend. She's really pretty. Thank you. Oh, look, look! See? Hey, look. We're matching. Yeah. Okay, guys, let's give the man some space. I'm sure he didn't come in here for all that. How can I help you? I just need a new system. I had a little mishap with mine. What's a mishap? I think that means a bad live stream. You saw that, huh? Uh, yeah. Where the fuck is the off button? Jesus. You've still got it pulled up. Great. I'll go grab that for you from the back if you're okay here. Yeah, yeah, I think I can manage, thanks. So guys, what's new? Oh, when's your Head Shot video coming out? I like to watch you play them. Soon. Yeah, I like to watch your videos in bed while my mom's at work. Cool, so kind of like we get to have a little sleepover. Yeah. I like to play your videos when I'm playing the same game. It reminds me of when I played with my dad. What happened? He just, he stopped playing? He stopped coming home. I'm sorry. Man, that's, that's hard. You know, when I was a kid, kind of about your guys' age, I used to play Pro Skater with my uncle Jeff all the time. He was super cool. Pro Skater? Man, you're old. Shut up. No, it's okay. I am. But best part was he actually gave me his whole system when he went off to the Army. Really? Yeah. Yeah, and I would play it all the time and I just remember that I couldn't, I couldn't just wait to show him how good I got when he got back. What did he say? He never made it back. He didn't like you anymore? No. He died fighting. But that's actually what got me into playing shooters in the first place. You know, I used to pretend that I could go and save him. So, I played all the time. Is that how you got so good? Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is. All right, here you go. Thanks, man. Excuse me, guys. Why don't we just throw that right on here? And you know what? Whatever these delinquents want. Great Scott is for the children! Great Scott is for the children! Great Scott is for the children! All right, guys, go pick out whatever you want, come on. Hurry up. Cute kids. Yo, can I get an autograph? Yeah, sure, man. Cool, man, cool. What do you want me to sign, a game? Uh, my back. I'd really rather not. Hey, Scott. No, she said she would be late and she will talk to you when she gets home. All right. Goodnight. Kyle, you talk that shit again and I'll post the video of you crying like a little bitch. Oh my God. Please do it, bro, do it, do that shit. Be nice, Scotty. It couldn't be worse than you crying on your stupid live stream. Mighty blow. Yeah, I'll admit that was not my best moment. Yeah, speaking of that, hold on for a minute. I need to live stream. Ew, gross. What did Joe think of your live stream? Wet and warm. Yeah, just like your bed sheets. Shut up! I'm having growth spurts. Yeah, Joe wasn't exactly on board with my live stream and by not on board, I mean he pretty much told me to go fuck myself and then bounced. Any word from Aly? - Not really. - She's gonna be home late. That's all I got. Oh, Scott. I'm sorry. Did you at least get the review done? No. Guys, I mean, I tried. No, man, I don't blame you. Your homeboy ain't fucking with you, your girl beefing with you, your shit all fucked up. Thank you for the recap. Really appreciate that. It doesn't matter. People are already saying the game sucks. Really? Damn. That's all I used to play when it first came out. The first one's a classic. Man, shit, that was the first shooter I ever played. That shit was so dope. Yeah, it came out the year I met Aly. Tango, you and I met playing Head Shots, you know. Oh, damn, that's right, girl. My dad used to play that all the time when I was little. I kind of miss that. Yeah, well, your mom wouldn't shut up, so I had to bounce. So stop bitching. Shut up, asshole. He stopped playing 'cause it got boring. Yeah, it hasn't been the same for a few years now. I'll probably skip it. Yeah, man, I gave up on that shit a while ago. Yeah, me too. I feel like they don't even really care about us anymore. You know what, guys? Some people do care. So I'm gonna jump off and try and finish this video. No you're not. You're just gonna go whack your wiener. Don't forget to clear your browser. Man, you don't even need to do all that. Just go incognito. Guys, guys, I am not gonna go whack my wiener, okay? I promise you that. God, I wish my lady mates play video games. Uh, sorry. The camera won't work. You turn it on? Um, yes. Whatever. Let's just start. I have to be up all night trying to edit this shit. So what are you gonna wear, army fatigues? Uh, no. I thought I would try something a little different. What is that? It's a Pima cotton button up I ordered online. Does it look okay? Let's just shoot. All right, dude, hold on. What? I'm sorry. Okay, I didn't mean anything that I said before, man. Fine. Can we start? Hey, I'm being serious. Yeah, I can tell by your shirt. So what are we doing here? I think this is us talking. No, we're just standing. Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm really just uncomfortable with this. Well you should be. You've been comfortable for a long ass time. I know, but, dude, all I ever wanted was for us to be comfortable. You know, making a living, making videos. What could be better? But I got too comfortable with the fans, with you, and worst of all, with Aly. Dude, I don't know what to do. Look, um, I know we all get wrapped up in ourselves with the likes and comments and shares and all that crap, but I can't even imagine what it would do to someone if it all comes from like millions of people. Yeah, it's exhausting. I'm sure. What's that leave for everybody else? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Well, there's your problem right there. What are your fans supposed to do if you stop putting out videos and stop being there for them? They'd unsubscribe. What are we supposed to do if you stop being there for us? Shit. Dude, come on. Don't unsubscribe from me, okay? Well you can start by being nicer to your biggest fan. Man, come here. Can I give you a hug? Not me. Aly. Shit, you're right. Aly. She's totally gonna unsubscribe me. You're really doubling down on that social media metaphor. Dude, I mean in real life, she's... She's gonna break up with me. What are you gonna do? The only thing I can do. What up, Scotties? It's your boy Scott with Great Scott Gamer and here is your review of Head Shot Heroes 10. Now Head Shot Heroes, the Mac Daddy of all first person shooters. Head Shot Heroes, the game that launched millions of channels. Head Shot Heroes, the reliable gaming comfort food. But you know what, Head Shot Heroes? We need to talk. So here's the deal. At the core of this game is incredible game play. I mean, the controls are just as intuitive as they were when they first launched this game 10 years ago, but that makes it so easy to overlook the fact that, well, it's just not that interesting anymore. Feels lazy. You know, and I think the problem is when something is so reliably amazing year after year, we get comfortable on both sides. Yeah, they give us the same old, same old, and then, well frankly, we just expect it. And because of that feeling we got the first time we played the game, or the first time we fell in love. You know, and yeah, they might give us a new level or a new character type, or we might order in from a new restaurant, but all the excitement's gone. So Head Shot Heroes, we're not breaking up with you quite yet. But if you can't commit to being a better partner in this relationship, then, well, you know what, we are gonna find somebody who appreciates us. That's all I got. So now if you let me get out of here, I'm gonna go appreciate what I have. Guys, thank you so much for watching. Don't forget to like, subscribe. You know what? Why don't you just stop watching this video right now, get out there and go enjoy the day with somebody that you appreciate. Later. I guess I should go. Yeah, I didn't wanna say anything. Oh, that's so sweet, Scotty. I'm so excited for you. Well, thank you. I'm more excited to see the Head Shot's team shit egg rolls when your review comes out. Egg rolls, egg rolls, egg rolls! Guys, no egg rolls. Yeah, I think they'll be just fine only selling tens of millions of copies. Man, forget that video game. Your lady game strong enough with that dinner thing you got laid out. Man, hopefully I can get my money up so I can appreciate Lady Fingers all over her body. Oh, that's sweet. I think. Maybe your roommates can appreciate you and raise your allowance. Hey, man, shut the fuck up. I don't get an allowance. I get paid for chores, motherfucker. Ooh. Appreciate that. All right, you idiots, I don't think I should be playing games when she gets home. So, I'm gonna jump. But before I do, I just wanted to say that I really appreciate you guys helping me out today. Wah! Are you gonna cry? Most of you. I appreciate most of you. Of course. Anything for love. We're family. We've got your six, brother. Squad life all day, Scott. Well I hope you can appreciate this, loser. Looks like your girl's out on a date with another dude. Check your Twitter, mouse dick. I got unsubscribed for a fucking lumberjack? You're getting axed! Get it? Because he's a lumberjack. Oh, what the shit? What the fuck are you wearing? - Amber? - Oh my god, Scott. You can't just come in here wanting sex and then changing your mind. Either you want this ill na-na or you don't. - Okay, Amber- - Fine, but sign a waiver before we bang in here. They're so strict. - Jesus, Amber! - It's the rules, Scott. I don't make them up. Amber, I don't wanna fuck you, okay? Scott. Oh my God, Scott. What the fuck are you talking about? Who's talking about fucking? I'm not fucking. What the fuck? Fucking dump his ass already, Aly. Use the fucking sharp axes. Uh, what are you doing here? Well, you know, you left your phone at the house, so. Oh. Thank you, I guess. You didn't have to bring it all this way. Is everything okay? Sure. Yeah, everything's great. Okay, good. Okay. All right. Seriously? You're just gonna unsubscribe me for the paper towels guy? What are you talking about? That fucking guy. Oh my God, Scott, stop. - What? - What? Hmm? Look, you know what, fine, I get it. I get it, all right? Go ahead, unsubscribe me. I got super comfortable and lazy and clearly he's the quicker picker-upper, so. And you know what? Maybe I am slightly smaller than average down in the dingle department but that has never stopped me- Okay, stop, stop. This is Alex. He's our ax throwing coach. He's teaching our group how to throw axes. I'm here with people from work. It's a team building thing. Teamwork makes the dream work. Hi, Scott. Hi, Melissa. I gave Aly your messages. Thank you. Hi, I'm Alex. Wanna give it a toss? No, thanks, Alex. I'm good. I do most of my tossing in the shower. Okay. Scott, stop it. Come on, we need to talk. Finally. Yeah, great, let's go talk. Oh shit! Yes, it's happening, motherfuckers! He's finally getting axed! Nope, nope, asshole 12 year old already beat you to that one, so. Fucking dweebs. Hey, you still gotta sign a waiver, dude! What is going on with you? Fine, I'm ready. Go ahead, put me out of my misery, ax me. Okay, what are you talking about? Where is this coming from? One of my followers, all right? He tweeted at me a photo of you and Mr. Brawny over there and, you know, I thought you were on a date. Why would you think I was on a date? Because you don't wanna be with me anymore and, you know, cause he looks amazing in plaid, duh. What? No, because this morning you told me that we needed to talk and then you just disappeared. Um, yeah, I was- Look, look, please let me say something. I know that I've been a pretty sucky boyfriend recently and yeah, you know, maybe I'm just not as fun or as exciting as I used to be. And sure, Google thinks I'm a bit of a narcissist but you know what- Sorry. It's okay. Look, when I met you at school, you know, I thought you were the most amazing person in the whole world and, you know, then all this gaming stuff happened and you noticed and you were impressed and I finally felt worthy to be in the same room as you. Scott, I just- My bad. Please, just let me finish, okay? So we started dating and so I kept working and I kept growing and you stayed. You know, that's all I ever wanted. But then, yeah, I think I forgot why I was doing it. I got caught up in all the attention and I stopped doing it to impress you and I just started doing it to impress everybody else. Oh shit. Great Scott. Oh my God. Is this... Hi, Aly. Is this the "We need to talk" talk? Can I give you my number? Anyway, what I'm trying to say- - Please? - In privacy. Okay. Aly, is that, I'm sorry, Aly. I really really am and I'm nothing without you. And if you still wanna leave me, I understand. Okay, Scott- But keep in mind, I will still, you know, social media stalk you- - Okay Scott, stop! - Okay, I'm sorry, fine. You know what, let me have it. Okay, Scot- God, that's unnerving! Scott, listen. All I wanted to talk to you about this morning was the apartment. The one above us is available and I thought that maybe we should think about moving upstairs because it's bigger. I mean, yeah, it'll cost more, but you'll have more room for your videos. Oh. So, we're good. Yeah. I mean, listen, don't get me wrong, you definitely need to come to bed sooner because it's cold as balls in that room. And I don't know, maybe you give Pac-Man a break and play with me sometimes. What is it with you guys and Pac-Man? He's like 40 years old. Oh my God, Scott, stop. Okay, no, you're right, you're right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. New leaf turning over. Okay, good, because now I'm giving you the ax. What? ♪ We got love that we'll never need to hide ♪ ♪ Love will always rise above ♪ ♪ Whatever comes ♪ ♪ We will be just fine ♪ ♪ If I am yours and you are mine ♪ ♪ Take my hand and let's fly away ♪ ♪ To another galaxy ♪ ♪ Hold me close ♪ ♪ I want to feel your love ♪ ♪ Together we are free ♪ ♪ Just be with me ♪ ♪ Just be with me ♪ ♪ Just be with me ♪ You know, who knew that a game without screens could be so much fun? I know it's weird, right? You're really good at it too. - I know. - Like scarily good. - Like really scary. - Are you an ax murderer? - Maybe. - We're definitely not getting an ax in the house, ever. Excuse me, ma'am. Waiver. - Scott. - Joe. - Hey. - What's up? Oh my God, did your typewriter run out of ink? Fuck off. We have an actual problem. What? That little shit Kyle just posted a video. Okay, so what? So, it's a video of your failed live stream and saying that you broke the review embargo on Head Shots and that they're gonna be pissed. Goddammit. Let's talk about this little fuck face commonly referred to as Great Scott. Hey, what's a review embargo? He ruined Head Shots for the entire internet. It's when the game committees make you agree not to release your review until a certain date. Oh my God, is it finally happening? Are you giving him the ax? Did you break up with him? Oh my god, I'm so happy for you. No, Amber, not now. What do you wanna do? Scott, how can I help you? Just tell me. No, no, thanks. You've done enough today, okay? - Oh shit. - Excuse me? - Scott, hey- - Seriously? None of this would've happened. Why didn't you just tell me about the damn apartment this morning? You never listen to me. I told you about the apartment last week. Boom! You are so done, Scotty boy. Shut up! Hey guys, can you please maybe take it outside? Alex, if you don't shut up right now, you're gonna take a spill that even your ass - can't pick up. - Stop it. Okay, that is enough, let's go outside. Ooh, that's the type of love I grew up with. You love this. This is an actual crisis and you're... What the hell is wrong with you? Look, what do you mean what's wrong with me, Aly? You know exactly what's wrong with me. I'm fucked! Oh my God. It's one video. It's one mistake. I'm sure they'll understand. It's not one video, Aly. It's my whole brand. Okay, your brand? Yes, if I don't have my brand, I have nothing. Oh, that's really weird. What? Well because five minutes ago you were nothing without me. So which one is it? You know what? Seriously, Aly? Not right now, okay? - Not right now? - Not right now! What was your little speech for then, huh? Because you're right, Scott. You actually do take me for granted but, luckily for you, I'm too busy to notice because I have friends and I have coworkers. But at least when you talk to me, I listen. I stop what I'm doing and I listen! Oh my God, I listen all the time! Just... Oh yeah, if I comment on one of your stupid videos. Just give me a second, will you? I'm trying to fix this. Yeah, it really seems like it. Hey, come on. Don't be like that, all right? Fuck you. Yes! Okay. They're good. - Oh great. So happy. - They're good. Look, all right, I'm sorry about that. - Sorry, sorry, okay? - Yeah, sure you are. I am, Jesus! Aly, Aly, Aly cat. Hey, hey. I meant everything that I said. Yeah, sure you did. I did, okay? And I do, all right, come on. Huh? So, will you? What are you doing? No. No. Really? Look, I knew as soon as I got on one knee, that it was just a terrible idea. And in my heart, I knew she'd probably say no. And I also knew that she was gonna kill me when she got home because I left that lobster out. Buy guys, I was desperate because I realized it didn't matter what I told her, or more accurately what I told myself. I knew I was gonna lose her. And not because of something stupid that I did or some grand gesture that I didn't do, but because I truly didn't deserve her. She deserves better. She deserves the best. And maybe that isn't me. Thank you. You know what, you were right. I gotta say that this is really way better than getting married. Oh yeah, you kidding? Having square footage is way more important than lifelong commitment. And with having the third bedroom for my video game set up, that leaves the whole living room to be our little love nest. Mm-hmm. And having all the bedrooms filled keeps Amber from asking to move in. Hmm, yeah, no comment on that one, okay? But, on that note, I better get the studio gear in that bedroom or Joe is literally gonna have a heart attack. Yeah, hey, wait. Look, I'm really glad that we're doing this and I do think that someday- - I know. - Yeah. And I really appreciate the effort that you're making, I do, but I don't wanna trade you ignoring me while you play games in the living room for you ignoring me while you play games in the extra bedroom. Okay, not gonna happen, not gonna happen, all right, because your boy has a game plan. - Okay. - Yeah, I do. Oh, but just in case, I did get you something. Right here. A house warming gift? Sort of. Even better, a feet warming gift, right. Just in case there is a game that keeps me up a little late once in a while. Okay, you know what? I hate you. Besides, these are more for me than for you anyways. All right, your feet are frozen. - That's not true. - Like little walking - dead toes. - That's not true. - Yeah it really is. - You're the worst. Like, they named the white walkers by looking and feeling your toes. - I'm done talking to you. - It's seriously after you. How cute are these? Aren't these fantastic? Double kill. I am so happy that you two decided to work it out. Yeah, me too. I mean, it's a great new apartment. And we've got plenty of time to figure things out. Great! Maybe you can figure out where your dick is while you're at it. Jesus. You know, Kyle, I don't really care if you have 100,000 new subscribers or not. You still suck. Careful, Great Snot. I'll make you famous. Damn, young buck is blowing up. But not as much as me, right, baby? You're right, my love. Well at least somebody got a yes. Without a doubt. God, man, where's Daddy Gamer, man? We need backup. He is out camping with the family. Outside, like in a forest? I guess so. Well, I think it's sweet to spend some quality time with your family. Well, I think it's sweet to have one more quality player and not get slaughtered tonight. I got you. Back out. I got a new recruit. All right, copy that. Hey, guys. No way! Aly cat blue is in the house! - Aly? - Wow. Finally! Someone I can actually talk to. Yeah, about periods. All right, careful, Kyle, 'cause I'll make you famous. Damn, I like her. Hey, yo Scott, I know you're gonna record this session, man. Your fans will love it. No. Tonight's just for fun. ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ We're sitting in a tree ♪ ♪ K-I-S-S-I-N-G ♪ And boom, there you have it. Happily ever after. I mean, what? Can you blame her? Seriously, look at me. Okay, in all sincerity, jokes aside, I know I am the luckiest guy in the world and I know that I still don't deserve Aly. And I know people are probably saying just terrible things about me in the comments, but that's okay because you know what? We are all just a work in progress and I'm pretty sure I'm still on some sort of like beta test mode. Honestly, if I learned anything throughout this, it's when you're trying to get that high score, you know, really level up, don't forget those who've been cheering you on from the beginning because it's those people that truly make you great. ♪ Things we've never felt before ♪ ♪ You and me now ♪ Later, Scotties. ♪ You, me ♪ ♪ You and me, yeah ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ We must be meant to be ♪ ♪ In a million years ♪ ♪ We'll still be sitting in our tree ♪ ♪ You and I ♪ ♪ Together we will fly ♪ ♪ Around the world and through all space and time ♪ ♪ We don't know what it's all about ♪ ♪ Maybe we should figure out ♪ ♪ This sense we've never felt before ♪ ♪ You and me, now that's for sure ♪ ♪ We don't know what it's all about ♪ ♪ Maybe we should figure out ♪ ♪ This sense we've never felt before ♪ ♪ You and me, now that's for sure ♪ ♪ You, me ♪ ♪ You and me, yeah ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ Yeah, you and me ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ Yeah you and me ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ Yeah, you and me ♪
