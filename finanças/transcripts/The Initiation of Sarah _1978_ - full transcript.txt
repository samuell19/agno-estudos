[INDISTINCT TALKING] -Come on, Patty, it's your turn! -PATTY: No, I'm freezing! -BOY: I'll warm you up. -Yeah. So will the fire. [PANTING] -Hi. -Hi. -You having fun? -Sure. [SHUDDERING] Ooh! Okay. Come on, level with me. Well, actually, I was thinking about tomorrow. Tomorrow is tomorrow. I mean, this is the last party of the summer. Loosen up a little bit. Just seems so final. The end of something special. Nothing's gonna be any different. [CHUCKLES] Hi, how's it going? Uh-oh. Except we got a crasher. I was watching you swim, you looked pretty good out there. -PATTY: Thank you. -Your body surfing's off a little, though. -Yeah, like a rock. -Wanna try again? Sure, why not? -PATTY: Ooh. The water's cold. -It's not too bad once you're in. -PATTY: Looks pretty rough. -Hey, come on. -Ooh. It's cold. -Let's have a little fun. PATTY: Oh! Oh. What are you doing? Stop it! Let me go! What are you doing? You're hurting me! Stop it! Let me go! Let me go, you're hurting me! [PATTY GROANS] No! No! SARAH: Stop it! BOY: What's the... [GASPS] Did he hurt you? No, I'll be all right. [PANTING] You just are gonna love sorority life. You're gonna meet all the kids who count. Now, when you go through rush, be sure you're on your best behavior 'cause they wanna see if you can measure up. Oh, Mama, that was 20 years ago. MRS. GOODWIN: It's the same today, believe me. Now look, this is Rose Regan's number. You be sure and call her the minute you get there. And mention that you're my daughter. Okay. We'll pull all the right strings, Mom. Oh, I know you will. I just want it to be as wonderful for you as it was for me. PATTY: Oh, it will be. Oh, and you too, Sarah. I want you to have a good time too. [SOFTLY] Thanks, Mom. [CAR ENGINE STARTING] Bye-bye. SARAH: You know, I've heard that sororities go a lot by who your mother is. PATTY: We got it made. You've got it made. What if they find out something terrible about my mother? Now how can they do that when you can't even find out anything? Besides, as far as they're concerned, we've got the same mother, the same father, we were brought up in the same house. [SIGHS] Well, two out of three is not bad. [CHUCKLES] Hey, do you know where we are, anyway? See French Hall anywhere in the map? I'm sorry, I lost track. Why don't you ask those girls there? Oh, okay. Excuse me. Hi. You look really lost. -[LAUGHS] Did it show that much? -Yeah, it did. Uh, we're looking for the freshman dorm. Oh, it's down here, two buildings on your left. -There? -Yeah, right down there. There's a parking lot right behind, you can park there. -Okay. -I'm Bobbie Adams. Hi, Bobbie. I'm Patty Goodwin and this is my sister, Sarah. -Hi. -Hi. Well, welcome to Waltham U. You'll probably see me there, I'm giving the orientation lecture. -Oh, good. Okay. -Okay? -Thank you very much. -You're welcome. -Bye-bye. -Good luck. What was your name again? Patty Goodwin. Bye-bye. -Patty Goodwin? -Yeah. I think she's got real possibilities. I think so. Definitely. [GIRLS LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] GIRL: Will someone turn this down, please? I can't really, I can't hear it. Okay, I can't talk over this. You want to get that for me? Thank you. Okay, girls, tonight you're gonna be visiting all the sorority houses on campus as perspective pledges. And you'll meet the girls who are active, that's the ones who already belong. And you can look them over and they'll look you over. And then, on Monday, all the houses are gonna send a list to the Administration Office of the girls they want. And you can choose from those who have requested you. And then the fun starts. -Pledging. -Pledging? Mmm-hmm. That's the period of time during the first quarter when you are, sort of, on probation with the sorority. How long is pledging? Two months. Then hell week, then initiation, then you're in. GIRL: What's hell week? Ooh, it's... You'll find out. [CHUCKLES] What house do you belong to? Alpha Nu Sigma. You're kidding, that's my mother's sorority. -Really? -Yeah. -Then we'll see you there later. -Thank you very much. Okay, girls, everything understood? Okay, bye-bye. Bye. Can I borrow that lipstick pack again, please? Thank you. [BELL TOLLING] Maybe we better just forget the whole thing. And live in a dorm? It's just what I said. What are we waiting for? You just relax. They'll take one look at you and sign you on the dotted line. You mean us. We're into this together, you know? Right. -[MUSIC PLAYING] -[GIRLS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Hello. Welcome to Alpha Nu Sigma. I'm Jennifer Lawrence. Hi, I'm Patty Goodwin and this is my sister Sarah. Hi. This is Kathy Anderson, Bobbie Adams, Laura O'Neil. -Hi. -Patty is the girl I told you about, Jennifer. Her mother was in A.N.S. Oh, so was mine. Well, that makes us both second generation. I'll tell you what? Patty, why don't you come on over and meet all the other actives? Kathy, why don't you take Sarah on over to the refreshment table? I know you're gonna love some of our girls. What's your major, Sarah? Psychology. Thank you. -Um, what's yours? -Excuse me a minute, some new girls. I'll be back. She ditched me the same way. Oh, I... I don't think she meant it that way. Oh, no? Well, they call it call it "tact." Everything they do at Alpha Nu Sigma must be tactfully done. Even a slap in the face. Anyway, the food is good. You wanna know where they're coming from? If you've got looks and bread, you can flunk study hall and they wouldn't care. I'll see you around. [ALL LAUGHING] GIRL: But since you've been here ahead, you might be able to pick one at campus. Not too much... Guys are up first. Hey, listen, as soon as you get settled in, I've got a guy who'll be just... -Oh, you're kidding. -GIRLS: Oh! [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Listen, you'll love him. He's about 6'2", jet black hair. He's a major hottie. Well, liberal arts for the time being. That way I can decide which subject takes the least homework. [ALL LAUGHING] Well, we're so glad that you came by too. I guess we better get going. Visit some other houses. Of course. You owe it to yourself to make some comparisons. -Just to be sure. -I suppose so. Why don't you visit P.E.D. next? [GIRLS LAUGHING] They're the second house down. What's P.E.D.? Pigs, elephants and dogs. [LAUGHING] Laura, you are so bad. It's Phi Epsilon Delta. Very old. And very...intellectual. [GIRLS LAUGHING] Don't pay any attention to them. Make up your own mind. Good night, Patty. I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name. Sarah. Sarah. Of course. Well, good night. -Goodbye, Patty. -Good night. -Thank you very much. Bye-bye. -Bye-bye. Well? What do you think? I think we've got a winner. And a loser. [EXHALES] [ALL LAUGHING] Well, all was right, just like it was 20 years ago. I think they liked us. Sure, what's not to like? Oh, Alpha Nu Sigma! [WHISTLES] That's a definite nine and a half. Look at that bod. Come on, Sarah, don't worry. What're you looking at? Nothing. -Sarah, are you all right? -Yeah. [PATTY GASPS] Well, you got past the biggest exam of P.E.D. Got past old Azarak. You do that to everybody? [CHUCKLES] No, you have to understand Barbara's warped sense of humor. You see, you can't let them know you're scared of them. See, dogs can sense when you're afraid of them and then they'll try and bully you. You sure got his number. How did he get out, anyway? You know, one of these days, I'm gonna take a meat cleaver to that mutt. Mrs. Hunter's liable to take one to you if you do. Mrs. Hunter? ALLISON: Our house mother. She teaches magical practices among primitive people. [CHUCKLES] Where is she? Probably in her room, forever, writing her thesis. Where are our manners? Sit down, you two. Thank you. Well, you've probably figured out by now that rushing is not our thing. We leave that up to the snobs. But, if you wanna live here, leave your name in the register and... You do have other actives? Oh, sure, but they're out or busy or something like that. -Like she said... -Rushing's not your thing. Yeah, I got it. Mmm-hmm. This is a beautiful, old house. Yeah, I like it too. [CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY] Well, Sarah, I think we've seen enough. If you're ready? It was very interesting. I hope you can come back. We have a few other places to visit. But this is a nice place. Well, we'll show ourselves out. Thank you again. Leave your name in the register, if you want. [DOG SNARLING] [GASPS] [WHINING] PATTY: Sarah, I think that's our cue to exit. Good night, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. Five names, that's two better than last year. Watch out, A.N.S., we're taking over. Well, what do you think? Well, I liked a couple of them. That girl in the white sweater? Sarah. Sarah Goodwin, yeah. She seemed pretty smart. I thought she was nice. You can have her sister. Really? What would I want with a snob? I don't know, she probably kissing Jennifer Lawrence's feet right now. Oh, Jennifer, oh, darling. -I must get a... -ALLISON: Oh, top draw, darling. PATTY: Didn't she introduce you to anybody else? No. She was busy with the new people. It wasn't her fault. But that's so rude. I mean, Jennifer was busy too but she took the time to introduce me to... Well, she probably thought that I'll go get some punch and I'll join you. She didn't mean anything by it, really. Don't worry. Come here a second. Come on, sit down. Now, did you notice the way those girls wear their hair? Here, hand me that clip. Now, I think, if you wear it up, you look better. You've gotta really make them love you. Okay. You know, we're really gonna be gorgeous. They've got to love us. There. You know, I thought when we got to college, we'd split up. But we're gonna do it together. Of course we're gonna do it together. I mean what fun would it be if we didn't? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] -Anybody home? -[BOTH CHUCKLE] There's a long-distance phone call for Patty Goodwin. Oh, that must be Mom. Thanks. Sure. I'll tell her the good news. You know, you really do look gorgeous. And Jennifer Lawrence herself took me around to meet the others. [LAUGHS] I knew you'd be terrific. Did you mention who I was? Well, I said you were an alumnus. You didn't tell them I'm head of the alumni committee? Honey, that's very important. Uh, Mom... Mom, I'm afraid they didn't like Sarah very much. I'm afraid they're not gonna take us both in. Oh, well, sweetheart, uh, Sarah is not exactly Alpha Nu Sigma material. I know that, but we always plan to stay together. Patty, I'll say it again, you've grown up now. So is Sarah. She can't expect to share everything in your life. I can't believe I'm hearing this from you. All I'm trying to say is you have to start thinking of yourself. It takes a very special kind of girl to get into Alpha Nu Sigma. Do you know what it'll do to Sarah if she doesn't make it? I just don't wanna hurt her. Well, of course you don't, darling. But just don't ruin your own chances by feeling sorry for her. But I do feel sorry for her. Well, then, think of her trying to fit in with girls Alpha Nu Sigma. Think of her trying to carry on a conversation with [CHUCKLES] somebody like Jennifer Lawrence for example. She just doesn't fit. She could learn. Patty, please. Don't get carried away by pity. [ANGRILY] What's wrong with pity? [DOOR SLAMMING] I've gotta go, Mom, goodbye. [GIRLS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Who put in the black one? I did. -Why? -She's flat chested. [LAUGHING] Look, if that's the only reason, I think we should go ahead and take her. I mean, we could fix that. Besides, her mother was a member. And she puts a lot of money into this place. Okay. Thank you, madam. -Done. -All right. Who's next? JENNIFER: Regina Wilson. That lardo in a tent? -[GIRLS LAUGHING] -Forget it. Well, one unanimous vote. That's for sure. All right. Patty Goodwin. She seemed awfully close to her sister, do you think she'll come in without her? Patty is A.N.S. all the way. She'll come without her sister. What's the matter? You've hardly said a word all day. Guess I'm not too talkative today. [SIGHS] Sarah. I know what you heard last night. It must have sounded awful. I didn't mean it that way, I'm really sorry. I'm sorry too. Guess I was a little tired and got out of control. Let's forget it, okay? Okay, it's forgotten. Come on, let's go get the bad news. [CHUCKLES] Patty Goodwin? Uh... Goodwin, Patty. Gamma Gamma Kappa. Alpha Phi Beta. Oh, and Alpha Nu Sigma. Congratulations. Oh! A.N.S.! Alpha Nu Sigma. I can't believe it. -Okay, I'll wait for you outside, all right? -Okay. PATTY: Now, pledging starts. Oh! [LAUGHS] Next. Uh, Sarah Goodwin. Here it is, Goodwin, Sarah. Phi Epsilon Delta. Phi Epsilon Delta? Thanks. GIRL: Next, please. Congratulations. I was hoping you'd be with us. Thanks. Um... Could you excuse me for just a minute? [GIRLS CHEERING] [GIRLS LAUGHING] PATTY: And now, do I get to meet that guy? [GIRLS LAUGHING] Okay, they're right next door. Did you get chosen? Oh, you did! Which one? [INDISTINCT TALKING] P.E.D. [SIGHS] Well, it's better that the dorms, right? Congratulations. Miss Goodwin, as a pledge of Alpha Nu Sigma, you must be loyal. This is the first test of your worthiness. -Are you ready? -Sure. You must address all actives as "ma'am." Are you ready? Yes, ma'am. All right, as you know, a pledge must obey any order given to her by an active member of Alpha Nu Sigma. Only then is she worthy to be called sister. -Do you understand? -[GIRLS GIGGLING] I didn't hear that. Oh, yes, ma'am. [GIRLS LAUGHING] Thank you. All right, then repeat after me. I will uphold the high standards of Alpha Nu Sigma. I will uphold the high standards of Alpha Nu Sigma. I will not eat while walking in public. [CHUCKLES] I will not eat while walking in public. JENNIFER: And I will not associate... And I will not associate... ...with P.E.D. Pigs, elephants and dogs, anywhere. Say it. If you don't say it, I'll get you black marked. From A.N.S. and every other sorority on this campus. Say it. [SOFTLY] With pigs, elephants and dogs. Louder, please. [GIRLS LAUGHING] Please, Jennifer. Louder. PATTY: [LOUDLY] With pigs, elephants and dogs... -[GIRLS LAUGHING] -JENNIFER: Anywhere. ...anywhere. Now, that wasn't so bad, was it? FREDDIE: [GRUNTING] I don't think I'm cut out for manual labor. It's okay, Freddie, it's good for you. -Just keep that corner straight. -I got it. Well, wonders never cease, huh? Sigma Delts have common labor. Hey, Teach, what we need is muscle, not mouth. Well, I'll give you a little expert supervision. Oh, that's okay. You just stand back and watch the speed of mechanical engineering. Hey, come here, Freddie. Give me a hand. Keep it straight, Ben. That's good, Freddie. Further. -Just a little more. -FREDDIE: Can we take a break? Hi, pretty lady. We only gave her a four, remember? Oh, I'm just rehearsing. Know it off, Scott. Ah, she's not your type. Come on, Freddie. Why can't we do this with a guitar or something? Huh? Sarah, please. [CREAKING] -Are you all right? -Are you okay? I don't know what happened, I thought I had that rigged perfectly. I thought it was completely safe. Thank you, Sarah. Listen, you better come inside and sit down and fix yourself up, huh? Just... Just a minute, okay? Sarah, are you sure you're all right? Look, -I wanted to explain something to you. -You don't have to explain. [PATTY SIGHS] Look, it's all a silly game they play. It's a part of pledging. The make you do horrible things to test your loyalty. Doesn't mean anything. Look, maybe I better not even pledge A.N.S. I mean, if it's gonna come between us. No, you have to pledge, it's so important to you. We can get an apartment together somewhere. No. Look, it's something you've been looking forward to your entire life. And I like the girls in P.E.D. and maybe it's a good idea that we spend some time apart for once. We can still see each other. Well, it'll all be over in a couple of months. Soon as I get through hell week and the initiation, then, everything will be the way it was. Nothing can keep us apart then. Okay? -You coming? -Just a minute. Look, nothing's changed, Sarah. Not between us, not ever. Okay? Hey. That was good going. She could have been killed. My name's Paul Yates. I'm a teaching assistant here. -What do you teach? -Psychology. You're gonna be taking Psych 1 this semester? You're probably gonna be in one of my classes. Wonder how that happened? I don't know. Sure was a close call. Listen, I have to go. Excuse me. Well, what's your name? Sarah Goodwin! I'll see you around, Sarah Goodwin. [BELL TOLLING] Hello. Oh, hi, Sarah. Um... Girls, this is our new pledge, Sarah Goodwin. Regina, new like you. Barbara and Mouse. We've met before. Well, what do I do now? Oh, well, find an empty room, pay your dues and relax. Yeah, we don't have many rules around here. Everybody does pretty much what they want. -Come on, I'll help you find a room. -Thank you. So, Mouse, what's your ral name? Alberta Kianovsky. I'd rather be called Mouse. Um... Oh. Well, hello, Sarah. Welcome to our sorority. Oh, Sarah, this is Mrs. Hunter, our house mother. -Hi. -Hi. Well, find yourself a room that you like and get yourself all cozy, and then come over, we'll have a talk. -And get to know each other. -Okay. What's that door? No one knows. Mrs. Hunter is the only one who has the key. And I've only seen her use it once. It's kind of creepy. Maybe it's one of those sacred ceremony rooms. You know, like, the sororities use for their initiations. Well, it could be but P.E.D. hasn't had initiation ceremony in about 20 years. This one here is empty. -Who's next door? -Me. I like this room the best. Because... it looks out at the Sigma Delts' backyard. So you can check the foxes without their knowing it. I wanted you to have it. I asked the others to reserve it for you. Oh, this is just a little welcome from all of us. Thank you. Um... Jennifer, why do you hate P.E.D. so much? I mean, have they done something to you? It's just a game. Um... Traditional rivalry! Like the Hatfields and McCoys. Hey, Mouse, what started the rivalry between the Phi Epsilon Delta and A.N.S.? I don't know. Mrs. Hunter seems to have a case against them. I'm glad you're here. Thanks. [VIOLIN PLAYING] -Oh, don't stop. -Was I playing too loud? No, I loved it. Come in. Sit down, if you want to. How long have you been playing? -Since I was three. -No wonder you are so good. The music keeps me from freaking out. What happens when you freak out? Oh, I... Well, I try to bail out a couple of times, you know. So they sent me away for a while. But I'm fine now. I'm really fine. I know you're fine. I can tell. [MRS. HUNTER HUMMING] -What is that? -Mrs. Hunter. -What is she doing? -Singing. [CHUCKLES] You'll get use to it. She's a little... But I hear she's a good teacher. I sure wouldn't wanna take one of her courses. Why not? 'Cause she really believes all that stuff she teaches, weird stuff, like spells and witchcraft! Would you play something for me? Please? [PLAYING MELANCHOLY TUNE] Hey, enough in there already! Sarah, Mrs. Hunter wants to see you in her room. If you're through practicing, we'd all appreciate it. I asked her to play. Yeah, well, when you have to listen to it day and night, the charm will wear off. Thank you very much. [BIRD CHIRPING] -[KNOCKING ON DOOR] -[DOG BARKING] Azarak! Azarak! Come here. Sarah, don't worry about him. Come on in. Out! Stay out! Azarak knows better than to fool around with you or me. Well, would you like a sherry? No, thank you. Well, I'll have one. Sit down. I thought, you know, you'd like to get better acquainted. You know, you have turned out to be such a pretty young lady. Thank you. Um... But wasn't your mother a member of Alpha Nu Sigma? My adoptive mother was. She is still quite active in the A.N.S. alumni. Really, haven't you ever wondered what happened to your real mother? I don't know. Nobody really knows what happened to her. She seems to have, um, vanished! And Mr. Goodwin? -He died. -Oh, too bad. The Goodwins adopted me when I was very little, so, Mrs. Goodwin was the only real mother, I've ever had. Aren't you curious about your mother? Yes. You know, Sarah, she could have married, changed her name. The stigma of an illegitimate child is quite different no, than it was then. She could be living someplace else. She could be. I'd give anything to know. Or maybe she isn't living someplace else. Well, I'd like to know that too. I'm sorry, dear. I've upset you. Tell me something, what have the girls told you about Phi Epsilon Delta so far, mmm? Only that there's some mysterious feud going on between A.N.S. and P.E.D. Oh, that old thing. You know, that feud was going on when I was an undergraduate at this college. As a matter of fact, I was president of Phi Epsilon Delta in my senior year. -Really? -Yes. Oh, we were the sorority then. Everyone wanted to pledge, the beauties and the brains. I think that was the year that I was voted "Sweetheart" of your father's fraternity. You knew my father? Oh, yes! [CHUCKLES] This is how I looked then. SARAH: Beautiful. Well, thank you. Oh, everyone knew your father. Anyone who's anyone. Patrick Goodwin, well, he was a big man on campus. Have you ever seen the garden from up here? No. The hedges look like a maze. It is. We used to have the final part of our initiations down there. You know, I think we should start doing it again this year. I think they were important. I think Phi Epsilon Delta should take its rightful place in this college again. And I think the ritual will have no meaning with you. I don't understand. Well, Sarah, forgive me but I know certain things about you. You are one of the very special people. Dear, you are gifted, lucky. With you, the ritual would have no meaning. Yes. I could show you how to use your powers. I don't know what you're talking about. I have to go. Oh, it's all right. We'll talk again. [DOOR CLOSING] We have plenty of time! So you believe that a person can be both good and evil. PAUL: Well, that's kind of... Or simplifying it. But, yeah, I believe a normal person can have elements of conflicting character traits. Sure. Yes? Do you believe that a person can seem to be one way and also be different and still be considered normal? Well, uh... Yeah, sure, I think a healthy person can have these conflicts to work out on a day to day existence. Sure. Were you thinking of something specific? No, I was just curious. Ah. Well, I'm going to give you all your first assignment now. I would like everyone to write a paper on the duality of personality. That is how these conflicting elements can be embodied in the same person. Now you can all start writing now 'cause I want it in by Thursday. [ALL GROANING] Sorry I'm late. I had to tell them I had a headache to get away from them. It's okay. So is that what you hoped at A.N.S.? Yeah, it's fantastic. How about you? -I'm making a few friends. -Yes, it's good. -Wanna go get a cup of coffee? -Sure! A headache, huh? [SIGHS] Look, I wanted to talk to my sister and I knew you wouldn't let me. You could get kicked out for lying to an active, you know. -I know that... -Patty, we are your sisters now. Come by, make up a coffee, I'll forget all about it. Come on. [SIGHS] Hi, Sarah. You wanna go for coffee? Whole damn world's drinking coffee! No thanks! Okay. Mouse, wait a minute. I'm... Hi. -Hi. -Buy you a cup of coffee? [SARAH CHUCKLES] Okay. Been trying to talk to you ever since you ran off the other day. I guess I was upset. That was a pretty upsetting accident. You wanna talk about it? Listen, maybe another time. I've got to go. Mouse! -Mouse! -[BRAKES SCREECHING] [PEOPLE EXCLAIMING] [WEAKLY] My arm, it's my arm. ALLISON: What were you doing? Oh, I guess I just wasn't with it, as usual. SARAH: Stop it, Mouse! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What I mean is maybe... Maybe we should try being more positive. Do you know what I mean? Like, instead of saying things like, "I guess I wasn't with it as usual." I'm not picking on you, Mouse. I'm not, I'm your friend. It's just, it's a perfect example of the way we've all been acting. Yeah, let's hear it for Sarah, the cheer leader. ALLISON: Come on, Barbara, quit it, she's right. You know, maybe if we all start being nicer to ourselves, we'll be nicer to each other. -Maybe? -Sure, we could try. Yeah, it wouldn't hurt. Do you know why she got hit by a car? 'Cause I yelled at her, that's why she wasn't paying attention. [ALL LAUGHING] [MRS. HUNTER SHUSHING] Quiet! Quiet! What a commotion! I haven't heard so much chattering around here since the 1950s. Oh, Alberta! Darling, what happened? She tried to fight the world's problems single-handed. [GIRLS LAUGHING] Well, I must say you all are in a very good mood over her accident. Well, Sarah just laid some very heavy truths on us. Yeah, look like we're gonna be a real sorority again. -Finally! -At last! Of course, you are the best one on the campus. -That's right! -And, Barbara, you listen to Sarah. -We haven't got much time, you know. -Time for what? Hell week! -We're gonna have hell week? -MRS. HUNTER: Of course! -[MOUTHING] -It's only a week away! REGINA: We're gonna have a hell week? [GIRLS CHUCKLING] And after that, we have a very secret initiation ceremony. Oh, what happens in the ceremony? Oh. You'll find out soon enough. [CHUCKLES] PAUL: You know, I'm glad you asked me to meet you, Sarah. I was fascinated with that paper you wrote for me. Have you written anything like this before? No. But I think about things like that a lot. I was especially interested in your notion about evil powers being present in basically good people. Do you believe it's true? What? A person can have a special power like that and still be considered normal. Well, we can get into a long philosophical discussion about what's considered normal. But I think I know what you're asking and, basically, yeah, I think it is possible. We read about these things all the time. I've got it. What? The power. Well, I'm sure you do, we all have our unique abilities and talents. No, you are not listening to what I'm saying. I have this special power. Sarah, whatever it is that's troubling you, I think we ought to talk about it. If... If you dwell on these things, you're just gonna cause a lot of trouble for yourself. Look, I have class in about five minutes. Um, why don't we talk about this a little later, okay? Like, uh, over dinner? -Okay. -Okay. I'll pick you up around 7:00. SARAH: Well, hell week hasn't been too bad so far. MOUSE: Mrs. Hunter is probably saving the terrible things for the initiation. SARAH: Oh, Mouse. [GIRLS LAUGHING] Oh, no! Now, Mouse. Come on! We're not gonna let them push us around anymore, remember? Look, how many they are. Looks like A.N.S. takes hell week more seriously. It's time to stand up to them. Oh, come on. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Got a quarter, a nickel, a dime? -Hi, Patty. -Hi, Sarah, how are you? Initiates are not allowed to speak to the strangers. [SIGHS] That stranger happens to be my sister. Oh, Patty, the members of Alpha Nu Sigma are your sisters now. Not some little low life from P.E.D. [GIRLS LAUGHING] Stop your insults, Jennifer. Hey, look, little old Mouse has her little old violin. Why don't you play something for us? -No. -Oh, come on. What's the matter, you've got a little violin elbow? [GIRLS LAUGHING] Leave her alone. Jennifer, I think you better stop it. I just want hear her play something. Let's see what you got here. What can it be? Huh! A little set of...a little Paganini. MOUSE: Give it back! JENNIFER: Can you really play all this stuff? I bet you don't need this music at all, do you? I bet you play by ear. Isn't that what happens with those prodigies? The child prodigy who can just play by ear? That's supposed to be the mark of a genius. Stop it! [COUGHS] My first day here, I saw you. And I thought you were beautiful. But I was wrong. All you care about is how popular you are. Everybody gives you everything. You don't have to work at anything like friendship. You don't care about how other people feel! All you give a damn about is how good you look. I'll tell you something, Jennifer. One day, all these poor, stupid girls who laugh at your cruelty are gonna see how ugly you really are. And they'll hate you. And they'll turn on you. Then you won't have any friends left at all. I wished I had a movie camera, she was beautiful. -How did Jennifer take it? -Like a punch in the nose. [ALL LAUGHING] Right from the start, she didn't know what to do. Wish I'd been there. Well, I know that chick, she just won't let this go. Well, if she wants a fight, we'll give her one for a change, right, Sarah? [GIRLS LAUGHING] Finally! Finally, it's happening! Yes, yes, girls, look at each other. Really look at each other! You are finally sisters! You are a sorority! Here, you have a leader. Sarah knows how. She will show you the way. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Come in. I came to apologize. Look, sometimes I just get so carried away with the initiation and our silly feud with P.E.D., that I guess I just forget about other people's feelings. Things have gone your way all your life. Sometimes you start to think maybe you are really better than anybody else until someone comes along and sticks a pen in you like your sister did this afternoon. Oh, I know Sarah didn't mean all that. She is really nice. She meant it. But it's all right, I deserved it. Could I tell her you said that? Maybe I'll tell her myself. [CHUCKLES] [STAMMERS] You really mean that? Look, this is not easy for me. Don't make me repeat myself, okay? Patty, I've been thinking, maybe I made another mistake, in not pledging her. That could still be remedied. Yeah, but how? That's easy. I'll just talk to the other girls. Oh, if you do that, everything would be perfect. Okay! It's set then. I'll talk to them. And in the mean time, if I'm going to break through that shell she's got built up against me, I need to know something about her. Um... What kind of food does she like? What kind of music? Who is she seeing? [CHUCKLES] Gee, I don't know where to start. Um, okay, now, I know she likes classical music and she really loves exotic foods. And she's been seeing a lot of Paul Yates lately. Paul Yates? Mmm-hmm. [DOOR CLOSING] [DOG BARKS] [GROWLING] Sarah, telephone. I think it's Paul Yates! Thanks! PAUL: Hi! -SARAH: Thanks for the loan. -Sure, you're welcome. SARAH: It's interesting but I don't think it has anything to do with my problem. Oh, no? Well, how is it different? Well, sometimes things happen. Sometimes people get hurt. Well, do you think you are responsible for those things? Yes. I think there is something wrong with me. Something that makes bad things happen to other people. Sarah, don't you think those things would happen to those people even if you weren't around? No. No? Mrs. Hunter seems to think that I make them happen when I get angry. Mrs. Hunter? It's our house mother. Erica Hunter? Yeah. She thinks I have a special power. Sarah, I'd like to hear a little more about your Mrs. Hunter, hmm? [PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC] Alberta, that was beautiful! Really, dear! You know, I have thought of a wonderful part for you to play in the initiation. What do I have to do, Mrs. Hunter? Oh, well, Sarah and I discussed it and we know you'll just be marvelous at it. You really... Alberta, why are you frightened of me? You know, you are a mouse. A little timid, scampering little mouse! Go on, keep practicing. Practice with your little broken wing. Some sort of investigation? Yeah, I found these old clippings in the library. Mrs. Erica Hunter was queen of the Phi Epsilon Delta then. Apparently, she used the initiation ritual in a strange way. Changed it, I don't know! Anyway, one of the girls died. They say it was a suicide. [GRUNTING] You're gonna make that phone call for me? Tell me why? I will, later. It's just a dumb joke. Jennifer, I just don't wanna do it. It's just one little favor. It's got to be tonight. -[LAUGHS] -You just gotta do it. [EXHALES] All right, but I don't like it. But you won't be sorry. Oh, yeah? Yeah. You know, I remembered reading something about a scandal involving Erica Hunter. Well, if it was really true then why didn't they kick her out? Nobody knows whether it's true or not! She disappeared for a couple of years, and then there was a new administration that came in, and suddenly she appeared again. You know, the interesting thing is, that it was Jennifer Lawrence's mother that made the accusation. Now that would give Miss Hunter a hell of a motive for hating Jennifer, huh? Well, it could've been suicide like they said. Or an accident. Why do you want to believe she did it? Why do you want to believe she didn't? Because it's a terrible thing to accuse someone of. -You of all people. -Look, if she really has something to hide and she believes you have some sort of ability, well, I just don't wanna see you hurt or misused for anything. So will you do me a favor? Hmm? -What? -Quit P.E.D. Move back to the dorm and stay away from that woman. I don't trust her. You don't know what you're asking. P.E.D. is the only house that wanted me. Those girls are my friends now. They're people who like me for who I am. Paul, for the first time in my life, they wanted me. Okay. Think about it, though, huh? No, not now. [BELL TOLLING] No, I'm sorry, I don't know where she is right now. Oh, wait a second, here she is now. -Sarah, the phone's for you. -I'm not here. It's Scott Rafferty. -Hello? -Hi, how's Wonder Woman? Don't call me that, please. Oh, sorry, I didn't know it bothered you. Hey, listen, there's gonna be a party tonight, can you come? -Uh-uh. No, I can't. -Why not? Well, first of all, I don't think Jennifer would like it very much. It's for Paul Yates. -What? -Paul Yates, it's his birthday. And since he's everybody's favorite teaching assistant, we thought we'd throw a party and celebrate. Can you come? -I guess so. -Great. Pick you up at 7:30. See ya. Oh, and don't tell him. I won't. Bye. JENNIFER: Now that didn't hurt, did it? [SIGHS] Yes, I do. Allison, I do. [ALL LAUGHING] You know something, I can't get over the change in this place. It isn't the place, it's us. You know, I can't tell you how proud I am of you girls. And especially Sarah. -Yeah, Scott Rafferty, of all people. -I know. Here she comes. [ALL GASPING IN AWE] [GIRLS WHISTLING] You've all helped me so much, I feel like I'm representing the whole sorority. ALLISON: Oh, you are. You're us, kid. [ALL LAUGHING] Sarah. Are you sure that you want to go? Yes, I'm sure. [DOORBELL RINGING] No, I'll get it. Here goes. Scott? Scott? Sarah, how do you like this, honey? [ALL WHOOPING] Look at Miss America. Come on, honey. Where you going, honey? JENNIFER: How do you like hell week, Sarah? You look like you got your dress in a pig pen! [JEERING] -That's enough, Jennifer. -Oh, stop it. To the left, to the left! [SCREAMING] Where's your Scotty wotty? Piggy, oink oink. [WAILING] ALL: Where's your Scotty wotty? [ALL LAUGHING] [SCREAMING] Sarah. Did you see the look on her face? -Gotcha! -[ALL GIGGLING] Nice work, Scott. That was a cheap shot, Jennifer. Oh, come on, what does she mean to you? I'm beginning to wonder what you mean to me. Hey, what's going on? Just a prank. You missed all the fun. [ALL LAUGHING] Why? What did you do? We just put them in their places. What happened? What did they do? Your sister was set up. What? Scott, it was just a joke. Come on. Sarah, your choices are clear now. Either you can crawl right back into that hole you've been living in, or... You can make Jennifer pay for that vicious so-called joke that she just did to you. Please, I need to talk to her. ALLISON: Sarah's not feeling well right now, she can't take any calls. I'm sorry. [HANGS UP] Make them scared. You can do it. Use your powers. -Patty. -Why are you worrying about Patty? Did she worry about you tonight? Where was she? She could have stopped this. Here. [BELLS TOLLING] Patty? Can we talk? Come on. [SIGHING] -Get angry. -I can't control it. Well. All right, we'll see, we'll see. We'll see if you can control. We'll try some little test tonight. Shall we? Some little thing. -A test? -Yes. Yes, a test. All right, now how did it happen? Well, all Scott would say was that he called her and invited her to a surprise party for you. -Oh, no. -What? Jennifer. I told her about you and Sarah. You what? Jennifer said she wanted to make it up to Sarah for the rotten way she'd been treating her. So, she wanted to know what made her happy so she could get closer to her. Oh, Sarah. If it goes all right, then tomorrow night, -you'll have revenge against all of them. -No. Now this rivalry has gone a bit too far, it's gonna destroy both of you. You hear me? -It may already be too late for Sarah. -I don't know. Now, listen, I want you to get her out of there. But I can't. I... I don't even think she'd talk to me. She thinks I'm a part of it, I know it. Has she ever refused to talk to you? [PATTY SNIFFLING] Then try. I'm afraid. I don't know if you know it, but I think there's something very strange about my sister. Think of Patty, think of Jennifer, and their beautiful, lying faces. Get angry. Even when we were younger, I can remember strange things that Sarah did. -Yeah? -Things moving. Uh-huh. Was it when she was angry? Yes, you're right. I never made that connection before, but she was always angry when those things happened. Get angry, Sarah, get angry. You can begin by leaving those girls at A.N.S. Scott's helping me move out in the morning. I'm gonna go tell Jennifer tonight. Forget Jennifer, just get out of there. I have to tell her. Relax, Sarah. Relax, dear. Now come on, now concentrate. Concentrate, close your eyes. Close your eyes. Now think about Jennifer. Think about Jennifer Lawrence. Beautiful Jennifer. The stupidly cruel Jennifer. The Jennifer who mocked you and humiliated and shamed you. Think of her, think of her voice coming out at you in the darkness. And that filth they threw at you, they covered you with that awful filth. Think of it. Think of how much you hate her. You hate all of them. Think of your hate. Think of it, concentrate on your hate and think of it. No! -Jennifer? -It's open. Sarah. Let her feel your anger. Let her feel the scalding sting, like scorpions. Sarah, do it. Do it. Nobody walks out on this sorority. Who put you up to this? Scott? No. I've had enough people telling me what to do for one lifetime. -This is my decision. -Don't give me that. Now. -JENNIFER: What's happening? -[SCREAMING] Ahhh! Help. JENNIFER: It's hot! What's happening? I can't shut off the water. -PATTY: It's hot. Turn it off. -I can't shut off the water. It's scalding hot! Help me. Please, help! -Help! -Jennifer! -JENNIFER: Help me. -[PATTY YELLING INDISTINCTLY] The door won't open, it's stuck. Jennifer! JENNIFER: Somebody, help! I can't get the door open, I can't get the door open. [BOTH SCREAMING] And then the handle came off in my hand. I couldn't stop it. And the water was scalding hot, look at this. [INHALES SHARPLY] Oh! I tried and tried to get out, but the door was jammed. And then all of a sudden, it just stopped. I mean, the water just stopped. -[KNOCKING AT DOOR] -Come in. Sarah, Allison just got back from her first class. And there's been quite an accident at the Alpha Nu Sigma. No one was burned badly, were they? Burned? No. Um... Their white, lily skins are a little pinker and sorer than last night. But they're fine this morning. You knew all about it, didn't you? Oh, Sarah. Sarah. [CHUCKLES] This is marvelous! It's all just in time, just in time. Tonight's the climax of hell week. What happens tonight? When it gets dark, a few sororities meet in secret rooms and they have their little secret initiations. But the important thing is Phi Epsilon Delta, at last, after 20 years... She is going to have her traditional ceremony. -No one will die this time, will they? -What? Sarah. Now listen, you and I must not fight and quibble over an ancient gossip. Now, specially now, on this most important night of our lives. We must work together, dear. Tonight, your gifts will reach their fullest potential at our ceremony. I promise you, you must remember that those cruel girls, for 20 years, have humiliated and degraded your sisters. Understand? Be proud you're a special person. Well, you've all made it through hell week. I wonder why they don't want us to wear any clothes under these. You'll find out, it's all part of the ritual. -Just probably trying to scare us. -Sure. Mmm-hmm. Come on, girls, we gotta get this stuff ready for tonight. Where's Patty? Patty is back at the dorm, where she belongs. Didn't you hear what happened last night? Patty tried to scald her to death. -Yes? -I wanna see Sarah. She's not feeling well. It's okay, Allison. Hi, how are you feeling? Fine. Heard there was a little accident last night at the A.N.S. house. You didn't believe me when I told you someone could get hurt. You think you're responsible for that? -I can control it now. -How? Mrs. Hunter taught me. Mrs. Hunter is only teaching you how to hate. And hate is the only real evil power. Don't give into it. Don't let them win after all. And I saw Patty last night. -She's resigned from Alpha Nu Sigma. -Her mother will be furious. Don't you care anymore? I'm free of Patty now. Thank you for coming. [CLOCK CHIMING] Pledges. You must wear these blindfolds, because no one is allowed to witness the secret ceremony until she's a full-fledged member of Alpha Nu Sigma. Where's Mouse? Hmm? Mouse? Mouse wanted to, uh... skip this part of the ceremony. She's going to meet us at the maze. Young women, tonight, you are going to see a demonstration of a power that science does not yet understand. And if you can see it and understand it, and believe in it, your futures will be miraculous. Sarah. This hood represents the darkness of ignorance. But this candle represents the light that can dispel that darkness. Sarah. Girls, put on your hoods. You're being led from one plateau of your life to the next with this important step. Follow your guide to the next part of our ceremony. MRS. HUNTER: Get your candles and light them from Sarah's. I am going to give you the words to help you pass through the dreaded darkness. Allison. Eko, eko, Azarak. The eye of the cat, known for its cleverness, agility and independent nature. May this symbolize your desire to pursue these qualities. MRS. HUNTER: We will now proceed to the maze. [BELL RINGING] Taste the eye of the cat. I will now show you the treasures of Phi Epsilon Delta. First, here is the pentacle. Its arms represent the arms of mercy and justice. The legs, they represent the pillars of wisdom. And the head, the truth at the top of the tree. From now on, this is your symbol, by which you will always know your sisters. And this, this is the ritual dagger that will protect us from evil and defend all that is good. And this is the blood of the animal. [BELL RINGING] Sarah, step forward. You have been chosen to lead us. I will now anoint you with the blood of the sacred animal. Sarah, you have been chosen the leader. You must use your powers now against the people who would destroy us. Sarah, use your powers to destroy them. Use them! And now the hour of reckoning is at hand. You have examined these women who would become our sisters, and tested them. Each one, you have found worthy. You may light her candle. If any of you has found any of these unworthy, speak now, or forever hold your peace. Use them! Destroy them. The wind. What's happening? Where's that wind coming from? [GIRLS SCREAMING] Come on, let's get out of here. There must be a sacrifice. [SOFTLY] Concentrate on Jennifer. Concentrate on hating her. Destroy Jennifer! [WIND HOWLING] [SCREAMING] You must be supreme! [SOFTLY] You will have the power. The women of Phi Epsilon Delta will rise up. It's already planned. You all will have the power, the real power. -What's happening? -MOUSE: Sarah. Help me. And it will be done. MOUSE: Please help me. First, there has to be... There has to be a sacrifice. Our ritual calls for a sacrifice. -MOUSE: She wants to kill me. -Girls, get her out of there. No! No. Stand back, now. Stand back. You can't take her away. Don't you understand? What is going to be will be fulfilled. Girls, get her out of here! No, stand back now. Stand back. Back! -Release it. -SARAH: No! MRS. HUNTER: You are profaning the sacrificial night. You are a traitor. I won't let you kill anyone this time. You've betrayed all of us. You are evil, Sarah. I thought that you were one of the anointed ones, but you're not. [GASPING] Sarah, stop it. SARAH: I won't let you kill anyone else. MRS. HUNTER: Use your power to stop it. -SARAH: No. -Stop it, Sarah. -Stop it. -[COUGHING] -Where's Sarah? -She's still in there. It's horrible. You can't find your way out. MRS. HUNTER: I won't let you destroy me. Sarah. MRS. HUNTER: I'm leaving this place. SARAH: No. Sarah. MRS. HUNTER: We'll both die. SARAH: Then so be it. PATTY: Sarah! Sarah! No, let me go! My sister's in there. Sarah! [BELLS TOLLING] [THUMPING] [SCRAPING] [SIGHING] Oh, hi. I didn't mean to startle you, I didn't know you were here. That's okay. No, this had to be done. I just couldn't bring myself over here till now. I know. The last few days, I keep expecting to see her everywhere. I still can't believe it happened. Yeah. Well, I guess that's everything. She was a real sister to me, Mouse. I'll never forget her. Neither will I. She was a special friend of yours, wasn't she? She saved my life. In more ways than one. She helped me see how down on myself I was. I heard you left A.N.S. Yeah, I... I guess I don't think like they do anymore. Where are you gonna stay? I don't know. Dorms, I guess. There's a... Patty, this room's free, if you like. We'd like to have you. [SNIFFLING] Oh, Mouse, I don't know. We'd really like to have you. Okay. Thank you. I'd really like that.
