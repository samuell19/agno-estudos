-Turkey's economy... -Europe is in the same situation... - Multiply the figures of TUIK by two and a half… -Raise, raise, raise, how far? -The target is the 100th anniversary of the Republic… -Uff! By Allah, nothing to watch is on TV. You really lost our heart. Look at this situation, you go up a channel, everything is fine, you go down a channel, everything is very bad. You go up a channel, we fly, you go down a channel, we crash. Which one is my brother, you made us crazy too. Aha, the bill came too. Every month, the invoice comes on the same day, at the same hour, at the same minute. So it hasn't changed. It doesn't bounce. 900 pounds? How about 900 liras? No, no, I'll take another look. I looked, it's still 900 lira. I swear it can't be something like that. Would it cost 900 liras to the tiny house? is she 90? No, there is another zero. God. God. Ahh. God. God! I'm on fire, God. I'm on fire, my God friends. Grow up friends, I swear I got burned, I burned for a long time. -I was stabbed in my back. -What's going on, Recep, what's going on? I received a 900 lira electricity bill, brother Salih. 50 lira was coming here. How much did it cost you? -It doesn't come to me. -How is it not coming? My cut has already been Recep for three months. I couldn't pay, they hung up. Oh my God, let me save my life too. By Allah, I will leave myself to the void... -What is this? What's this? -I'll take an order, get out. Walk away. To the start order. My electricity bill came to 900 lira. Shhh look at me Halime, how much is it for you? 200 came. Are you using illegally or are you using electricity from me? -Did you hook my line? -Get out of there. Get out of here. Go get your order from somewhere else, don't bother me. I swear I'm going to throw myself here huh. Friends, friends! Brother Salih, let me know that I am going to go inside Nurullah and commit suicide. Don't be ridiculous, Rex. I'm ending my life, sorry. I am committing suicide. -My mother. - Get well soon, brother. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks to friends. Thanks to friends, Nurullah. Brother, why are you talking like that, you make me sad. I have 400 lira income, how can I pay the 900 lira bill? Is this a thermal power plant? Is this an industrial facility? Is this a factory? Two rooms and a living room here. Look how insanity came, did you see? -Brother, should it not exceed 150 kilowatts? -How can I understand him, Nurullah? -I don't know. -How will I know? Do we put a meter on our ass and we will understand that one hundred and fifty kilowatts. How do we know? I'm lighting two light bulbs. I only light two light bulbs, I am Nurullah in this house. Ah, they are also open. Close and close. Get up, close quickly. Next month we burned again. I swear to you, God will give you trouble for lighting a light bulb from now on. God damn that Thomas Edison, and that Nicola Tesla, too. Brother, calm down please, calm down. Either I save, save, save, came here. I warm my shirt by putting the lahmacun of the night before while ironing the shirt the next day. I dry my socks in the oven with the pastry. This is how we live, but Nurullah. Are you dead? Are we living? Brother, calm down bro. Do not scare me. Well, from now on, I will only be illuminated with a gas lamp at home. There's no other. I will walk around the house with candlesticks like the 14th century English Royal family. Open it, open my grandma's mahogany chest. There would be a kerosene lamp in it, three or five of them. Find them. It's a shame. We are human, human. Is it there? Did you find it? Smooth! Mixing, digging woman's chest, neat. Oh brother, you're fine, you're fine. -What happened man? -There is a deed. Don't mess with the woman's private belongings. Find the gas lamp there. Don't you know bro? What will you do, son? I call you gas lamp, leave the deed. Gee. Did the deceased have any other heirs? -Did not have. -Well, then this deed is your brother. I don't want it, Nurullah. I don't want anything from the title deed. I have no eyes for the property. Brother, take a look at this deed. You attached it to the deed. It's called Yutan Village. All right. This is my grandmother's village house, which we went to as a child. It's a dirty place. He also has a key. Come on, let's go to that village. Don't be ridiculous, Nurullah. I'm already depressed. I can't take village life at all, please. Look, we're going to get some fresh air. Our feet will touch the ground. Let's throw out our electricity, brother, in the village. Look, you said electricity again, you pissed me off. You got my genies on me, huh? I was just forgetting, you said electricity again. Brother, don't hurt me, let's go to that village. -No, Nurullah, I can't go. -Let's go bro. -No, I won't go. -Please bro, let's go bro. -Don't break me, please. -Beg some more. -Please, it'll be fine. -Beg some more. -Come on, Rex. - All right, go pack my suitcase. Okay, go pack my suitcase. -Salih brother! -What happened, Recep? Make me a lane. [playful music player] Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Would you look at this situation, Nurullah? Live your mind, it was really perfect. I swear, look, I can smell my grandmother right now. It also mixes with a little bit of dung, but I get it. Ya Recep, this house is very neglected. We can't fix this house. Nurullah, once you start, you can finish this place in two days. -I'll do it? -I'll do it? Of course you will. Aren't you my squire? Come on, come on. I'll help you too, come on, okay. Let's go, start! Come. lol. lol. [cow voice] Yes. It was very nice. [the music continues] Get started son. Work! Paint properly! Yes, get out there. Beautiful. Hang it there. Remove, remove, remove. Fix it there, where you hammered the nail, and I'll see. No, no, it's been long. You just pull it out, knot it in there nicely. -[reverse warning beeping] -Let me check the knot. hey. Take this out and tie it up nicely. Yes, did you knot it? Hang it there nicely now. Very nice. Let me have a look there, I'm at it now. Let me see a minute. Ok, it was like a flower Nurullah, it was perfect. It's good like that. Aha! What is it? Hello! damn! Burst! Hello! -What does that say? -No? -Sorry, I don't understand, what are you saying? -No, I say, what did you not understand? No, it's like "hello", "burst" or something. What's happening? Do you have a military friend in front of you? What's up? Okay ma'am, don't get into a double polemic with me there. Look, this is everyone's owned land, you can't come here and set up camp in your head. Camp below. To the pasture, let's go to the pasture! -Come on bro, mind your business. -One second, Ezgi. what are you saying bro? Ha? Can't understand what you are saying. I'm coming, tell me, tell me here. What do you say, what do you say? Please tell me. Looks like your nervous system is a little up in the air. I understand you have mental problems. This is not a campground. This is everyone's own, their own land. I know my friend already owns the land. This land is mine. -Does this land belong to you? -Yes it's mine. Who says? How about "Who says"? I'm saying. Inherited from my late grandfather. Gee. Here is my grandmother's legacy. Gee. What are you showing off to me here? What are you talking about, bullshit? No, also what's going on with you? What are you messing with people? It's not your land, it's nothing. Nobody who! My God, my Lord. Okay ma'am, okay. Either we are neighbors here. They said that the neighbor needs the neighbour's ashes. you come tomorrow, "I'm out of lemon, do you have any lemons?" "I'm out of salt, do you have salt?" Then you say that I stayed in the field, worked, my back was stiff. My entire neck was burned. Massage the shoulders with yogurt like this, you say. -AA! -You call me. -You call me. -What are you saying bro? Repent, repent. Why would I tell you such a thing? Look, we don't need anything, okay? You're going to mind your business here, and we'll have our fun. Let's talk to you as little as possible. Look, we came here to relax, I'm out of my hands! It was not pleasant to meet like this from the very first second. None. OK? Come on. Come on thanks. I was also very curious to interact with you. Hag. -Did you say something? -Sorry? Did you say something behind my back? I didn't hear, did you say something? Oh, I said. I was gossiping behind your back. I backbited, what happens? My friend is my special friend. The land is my private island parcel. Can't I backbite in my private life? Don't let people dictate such a standard of living! Just relax! Whatever you do bro. What about me? Gee. Just don't contact me. OK? Come on. You will listen to your head, we will gossip in our private lives! "Inherited from my grandfather." It was inherited from his grandfather. - Strange strange things come to my mind. -What's coming bro? I wonder if this is between my grandfather and my paternal grandmother... -Oh, is there such a thing? Well, anything happens in life. ♪ We found the house, meadow grass, everything comes from our hands ♪ ♪ Neighbor sister took a trip Recep frowned ♪ -Selamunaleykum aghas. -Aleykumselam. -Sit down Nurullah. -Brothers. Brothers. Welcome brothers. Is it okay if I take you to that table? No, why bro? Brother, this table is reserved, so I can't sit here. Is there a reserved table in the village coffee house? Is this Nişantaşı, my son? Brother, now you are new in the village, you are not used to it, but this table is the reserved table of the headman. He doesn't want me to sit someone else down. No! As far as I know, the headman's desk is in his office. Did the headman get a table in the village cafe? Who is the mayor? What is the difference between you and me, mayor? -Don't we elect the headman Nurullah? -We choose, brother. Brother, you are right, it is a slightly different model. When someone else sits down, he goes crazy, then he takes his anger out on me. There is a different model in the village now, coach. Get this in your head. I'll sit at this table, brother, that's it. -Sit down Nurullah. -Okey brother. Do you want anything? -Do you have an oral? -There is brother, what should it be? -Kiwi. -OK. -I'll have tea. -Okey brother. You see, don't you look? Go to the most luxurious restaurant, you will not find a kiwi orallet. But there is always a cafe in the village. My choice is tea bro. -Ercan. -Welcome, mayor. What business? Look, the private secretary called, reported. No, Ercan. It didn't happen. -Bring some tea. -Of course, mayor. -No, brother, do you have a problem? -How? You're talking about something like "it didn't happen, it didn't happen". Don't bother with the coffee shop, talk to us if you have a problem. I don't have a problem. I am the headman of this village. You? We also own land in this village. We are the people. Did you understand? Recep İvedik is my name. No dear! Look, may God make you believe, I said while driving from there I said, "Well, I know this face, this eyebrow from somewhere." Ya Recep, don't you remember me? No, I don't remember, who are you? Hey, I'm Asim, Asim. You used to come here every summer, we used to play together. We would even play games along the creek, throwing stones at each other. Don't you remember? Well, look, now that I'm talking, I took it out a little bit. Aren't you our idiot Asim? I ripped it's head off. You should have 28 stitches on your head. Yes, yes, that's my job. Look. Aha. Look, there are 28 stitches here. -I couldn't come to myself for two days, that's why me. -Are you the headman? The people show confidence. He's been choosing me for three terms. Tuh the choice you make. Well, I'm here for service, Recep. Look, look at the beauty of these. They all voted for me. But I said, I said I will not be a candidate this year. But is it you? Do you call crying or whining? But I said, so I'm going to do my own thing. Real estate is my own business. I have a company. But believe me, I can't find the time to do it. Of course, of course, dear. Same problem with all of you. You can't spare time for your own work, you spend all your money for this people. You said it right, Recep. Shh boy! Shh, let me see! Bring those leaflets and distribute them to my people. Recep, these are yours too. -What is this? - A big investment is coming to the village, Recep. It's not like that. Tomorrow the authorities will come to our cafe to explain this. Will it be in coffee? If you are available. If you don't have a job, come along. Let's see, if we're available, we'll come. Isn't it Nurullah? -We'll come, brother. -Very pleased to meet you. Pst, Ercan! You gave my table to your brother Recep, so I lock the tea for him. Come on, stay well. My God, my Lord. Will you beat it or leave it until the morning, you idiot of God. This has been the case since childhood, Nurullah. Her grandmother used to give the cows to go graze, the cows always come, one or two missing. Later we realized that he was selling the cows one by one, he was spending it in the farm. Dishonourable. See you soon asshole. Come on, take it easy you bastard. -Damn! What are you doing! -I'm fine, Recep brother. -Are you going home? -Yes. -Say hi to your father. -Good evening. Good evening. [snoring sound] Uff! I really can't sleep, huh. I was terribly awkward about my place. This woman already got on my nerves. They said don't buy a house, buy a neighbor. How nice, we said that the side plot is empty, the woman came with her house. Blue-eyed yellow scourge. Look at this. Here he is snoring like a Bulldog dog. Damn Nurullah! Nurullah! -What happened bro? - Get up, get out. -Where will I go, brother? -Get out, wherever you go. Go, I left the food out. Maman, go eat your water there. Quick! -Where will I sleep, brother? -Go lie down in the barn! Go sleep in the barn! -In the barn? -You're snoring like glass. Get up, get out! Exit! Was it "God wake me up, make me fall into dreams"? Here you go. [cock crows] Nurullah. Nurullah. Get up, get up! Get up! Were you here, glass! You said sleep outside, brother. -Good morning dear. -Good morning. Get ready now, we're going to coffee. Aha! What are they doing there? [indian music] Bismillahirrahmânirrahîm. Selamun aleykum. What are you doing there? We greet the sun. What? -Are you saluting the sun? -Yes. - Say hi for me too. Aleykum salam. -Moon! There was a meeting at the cafe. -TO? They also distributed the brochure yesterday. There is an issue that concerns the landowners. -Good. -You are the owner of the land, young lady. maybe you are interested. I leave the brochures here. Where will you leave it there? Wait a minute, I'll come and get it. -Here, I left the brochures here! -AA! -You can get it from here. -He threw it like a bear. -It's amazing. -He's mentally ill. -[kiss] Geh bili bili bili bili. -Look! Geh bili bili bili bili. Geh bili bili bili bili. Don't make any silly moves. Don't make me nervous here. Geh know know. Will you go my friend? Will you come to your house? -Take care of yourself. -Hasbinallah and nimel deputy! Dear Yutan villagers. Today, we are witnessing a historical moment for our village. To tell about this big project to be done in our village. I give my word to Erdem Çökelek, the heir and prince of Çökelek Holding. -Here you go, sir. -Thank you, mayor. Dear ready. My dear fellow villagers. As you know, as Çökelek Holding, we have always done our best to bring added value to this country. This has become our national debt. In this sense, we wish to introduce the famous mud of your village to the whole world. I think you call this healing mud Swallow mud. -Do you believe? -Here you go, my beautiful peasant brother. Thank you. Now, is this mud that we have known since childhood, that buffaloes poop into, that comes out of those rocks? A, yes, yes. We're talking about mud coming out of the rocks. -Is that mud medicinal? -I don't know, bro. OK, you go on. If I have any questions, I will continue. I'm always waiting. Yeah, what were we saying? This mineral is high, this healing mud is of course thanks to my uncle's leadership and strong leadership. We will introduce it to the whole world. So what are we going to introduce? Of course with this project. Yutanbiance Thermal Resort Hotel. Translate. As you can see here, my dear village friends, this is a facility located on an area of ​​150,000 square meters. Aha! What the hell is that Nurullah? They're getting pretty busy here. Let's move on to the next picture. Here are our mud spas and pools. Change. Dear brothers and sisters, we have come to one of the most striking and important places of our project. Imagine you have a pistachio-shaped pool with 24/7 chocolate flowing. You get out of the normal pool, you put your mouth on the chocolate, you go into the pool again. Could such a beautiful thing be possible? Let's change. Look, hop on the slide directly from your room, you enter the pool in the morning without washing your face. There can be no such thing. Translate. Would you take a look at this beauty? To the beauty of this project... My uncle really shed. A work of mastery. -Do you believe? -Here you go. I'm looking at the project now, but I couldn't see our village. Where exactly is our village? So, it's perfectly normal for you not to see it. Because we removed your village from there. How did you remove the village? How do you think about removing the village? Everyone here has a home, a dormitory. Isn't it so, gentlemen? [in unison] Right! E, it goes like this. We, our peasant brothers and sisters, bought their houses, plots and lands at a price higher than the current market price. It is very easy to remove after purchase. Anyways. Yes. When we came to this area, I was just telling about it, and in the forest area, as you can see, without harming the nature, We are deploying large and small villa-style houses here. -Look here. -Here you go, brother. Now, as far as I can see here, you are building a house in the forest. Then you will cut down trees here too. [in unison] Yes, that's right. No. We said we don't touch nature. We place those houses there by moving the trees there. How will you transport the 100-year-old pine forest? -Are you kidding us, idiot? -What are you talking about bro? Who is this? E, he has a house here, he has a land. So I know when I was a kid. leave it to me. Ya Recep, if you love your God, don't be against such a beautiful project. We don't want it right away, we don't want it. Of course, I will say we do not want it, Asım. I'm looking at the project, excuse me like my ass. Don't be silly, sir. What an ass. So it's a pretty cool project. Everyone liked it. This will be rewarded. -I want to say something too. -You were missing, teacher. If you love a silent God, we are talking. You have no property, you have no property. Cut it, cut it! The teacher will talk, of course. Shall we listen to you or your teacher? -Speak, son. -Thank you brother. Look, this project has no contribution to the people of this region. Only you will profit from this business. The villagers are left with what they sell for three cents. Is not it? [in unison] Right. Why would the villagers sell you this place? If they keep it, they will be much more profitable. He, more profitable. Guys, you are talking nonsense. Already more than 50 percent of my peasant brothers already signed the pre-sale contract. What the hell, who signed what? I own the land here. Heirlooms from my grandmother are both this village and these forests. We have so many memories here. We grew those trees with our hands. I will not make you do this project here, I will not cut down a single tree, you understand? Don't come here with your hair as if you licked a buffalo. I say no to your project. No, no, no! Who cares about you bro? After I find 50 percent, I print expropriation and expropriation as well. -Who are you? -Who are you? No! It was that easy. Look, I came here, first I listened a little to understand the subject, but I didn't like your way of speaking. My neighbor. My neighbor. His hand is fork. Now this is burned. -What do you trust, no? -Come on. This one was missing. Who is this? Well, I see it for the first time in my life. It's an environmentalist, feminist thing, I guess. What do you say? Don't talk nonsense. I introduce myself. Attorney Büşra Altın. I also own the land here. Who are you, I don't understand that. We destroy, we destroy, we expropriate, we collapse! What's up? Who are you threatening with what? What do you trust? Look, sister, if you are a lawyer, then you know how expropriation works, you probably understand, right? I understand. I know very well that expropriation business. Do you know how many I canceled? I know people like you very well. Do you think you can do anything with your money? Get out of there! Look, I didn't mean to be disrespectful because you're a lady, but you came here and did your show. Bravo. Bravo. Cut it out! What show? For one thing, not a woman, a woman. This is a. Secondly, you will be a man, my son. Look, I'll deal with you here. What does it say? Who are you? Who are you threatening? Look son! In this project, I will research the permissions and so on. I got it for you son! Either you are a lawyer. I have 500 lawyers, girl. I'm coming, I'm on your back. I will research all of them. Leave me! I'll deal with you son! I will try! Are you a suburb? What kind of lawyer are you? Ms. Büşra, let me break their mouths and noses. who are you? If I hit that chair on the head of it, it will be okay. No! No no! Chair… Ah, a! Don't touch my hair either. Get out of here. No such thing. Get out of here! Go away! -Go away! -Dear colleague... -Don't be upset with the man! Fuck off! -You're a lady! Don't do it to your friend! Cut it out! -He's going to finish me off. -Come in. I fucked you so bad. Wait for me! I wrote you in a corner. I'll deal with you, wait for me! You are all welcome. Thank you too for coming. -You are welcome. -Now, if I'm not mistaken six or seven months ago this company came to our village. -Hmm. -They wandered, dusted, after that, as you can guess, they contacted our headman, Asım. -Rep bro? -No, teacher, nothing. -Brother? -I didn't do anything, teacher. Anyways. They had a meeting at the cafe. Tensions broke out, there were arguments. The majority said no at first. There was even the headman Asim among them. -Aha look, didn't I tell you, son? -You said it, brother. Muhtar Asim has a definite job. Brother, whatever happened next, for some reason, those who said no at first started to say yes. Of course. There was a scam there. Of course dear. That stupid headman, that stupid Asım is the organizer of all these things. I'll tell you. Whatever he did, we must do the same. -I don't know, could I explain? -Yeah, he's right. We need to talk to these sales people one by one. Look. Smart girl. Educated girl. The girl thawed the roasted chickpeas right away without saying "lebleb". Shall I tell you something? Do you have a list of them, son? Yes, Reb. There is a list of them all. Tomorrow we will start walking door to door with you, lion teacher. -We're going to convince them all back this time. -Okey brother. ♪ I will go, I will see, I will ask, I will ♪ ♪ I'll go door to door saying why did you sell it ♪ ♪ I'll go door to door saying why did you sell it ♪ Uncle Seyit, let me eat the oil of your eyes and don't go away. Don't do it on behalf of these puppies. Look how beautiful they are laying eggs. They're gurgling. Nephew, I'm sick of these. -If you like it very much, you buy it, you look at them. -What should I do with your chicken? -Tahsin emmi, don't sell your hand here. -I will sell it. -Don't sell. -I will sell it. -Don't sell. -No, I'll sell it. There are lands that you put up for sale. Let me love your eyes to sell their land. What's wrong with you from my lands? What if I sell to you, what if I don't? -The lands are mine, I will sell the lands. -Why are you beating us out of nowhere? -Selamun aleykum. -Uncle, we heard that you are selling too. -We will sell it. -But your places were also partners. -Partnered. We're here to say, "Come, think about it again." I don't want it to be sold. Okay, if you don't want it, I won't sell it, so let's talk to other partners, then. Look, now listen to me carefully. We are five siblings. Orhan and Osman hang out in the pavilion. Orhan opposes his brother. They stick one slap to each other. Orhan shook him from below with a knife 37 times. -Is Osman dead? -It came out six months later. -The handle of the knife is still inside. -Hoot! Selamunaleykum my aunt Sultan. Wasn't there an uncle? What was the matter, tell me. No, sister, it's not something you know. We need to talk to him. Why can't you tell me? Are men and women not equal? Tell me so I know. We will talk about the sale of land. You probably don't know. What plot? Which plot? What sale? Who did he sell it to? When did it sell? He can't sell without me knowing. Look, they're going to destroy this whole village, all these forests. I love your eye, don't sell it. I will sell. I'm going to sell it, what are you messing with, my nephew? This time Orhan goes after Samet. He is arguing with his wife. He ties the rope to his own wife and takes her to the forest. Six months later, they found his bones. What are you saying? Osman Emmi came out of coma. He followed Samet. When you can't find Samet -She slipped into Samet's fiancee. -Whoa! -Don't sell. -I've made up my mind, I'll sell it. -Don't sell. -Impossible. No, I will sell. -Don't sell it. -I'll sell whatever you say. -Don't sell. Don't sell! -I put my mind to it, I will sell it. -Can I tell you something? -Like this. Look, on the other hand, I shot a lion in the mountains. Give me this. Why are you drinking like this? I'm depressed, I'm drinking. I found this, I'm drinking. HE! What's this? Let me have a look at this. Recep brother, this is hand sanitizer you know. Are you drinking antibacterial here at dusk, brother Ismail? Is something like this drinkable? I'm full of germs. I am in trouble. I drink this, I expel germs with urine. Yahu, worry is not something like a germ or bacteria so that brother Ismail can be used with antibacterial. -Feel, feel. -I urinate. Ismail brother, let me love your eyes, drink less. Or do you not know about the sale of this land? Your very vulgar husband is selling this land. We can't sell that shoddy honor! He can't sell without me knowing. It can never sell. Can't I just chop it up with an ax now? You bastard! Unaware of me... Let's go teacher. Murder is being committed here, run away. How much! -Samet prints them on the bed. -OMG. Look at the events. TO? They take Osman's sister Nimet and throw them into the acid well. Now that the situation is like this, they throw Songül and Nergiz, her uncle's daughters, into the sawdust. -It's a lot of sawdust. -Yes, they grind it with a sawdust. I swear, uncle, can I tell you something? Very right decision. What kind of family are you? Buy it and go! God damn you. Get up, let's go. oof. -No, I'll sell it. -Don't sell. -I put my mind to it, I will sell it. -Don't sell. You're going to take my arm off. I will sell it. If you sell, sell. If you sell, sell. -Good by. -Is it a rose? You can go. -What a stubborn man you are. -I will sell it. What a stubborn man you are. Rose rose. Maybe there was no result. Well, we went through the list one by one. Men say Noah, not prophet. They all have a word in their mouth. I will sell and I will sell. I will sell and I will sell. Don't do it! Uff! -What did you do? -Well, my situation is not good either. I have been reading their EIA assessment report since morning. Pretty much approved. Is it okay if we object to the EIA report? We object, but you know that the factor here is the benefit to the local people, and 50 percent of them want this job. So we're not very strong there. Ms. Büşra, you still make your objection. They say we didn't get out and hope is not lost. Okay, okay, so let me do it. -Recep! Recep! -Aha! Nurullah. This is the voice of the ax Sultan. -Oops! -My mother came to cut us now, I wonder? -The Sultan with the ax? -He. Aunt Sultan. He always travels with his axe. Recep! Recep! You have you! You have you! -What happened, Aunt Sultan, what's wrong? God sent you to us. Are you a maniac, Aunt Sultan? If you're going to say something nice, why do you come with the ax in your hand? -Oh, never mind my job. -What happened, please? The subject is very important. We do not sell our goods.

Selamun aleykum. Aleykumselam, who are you? I am Recep İvedik, my brother. Who are you? -Feridun is my name. -I'm glad, brother. Well bro, where is my lawyer? How should I know brother, your lawyer? I don't know you. Aren't you a lawyer? -No, I'm not a lawyer. -Then why did you come and sit here? …we demand alimony of 100,000 TL, sir. E but yuh so now. Ms. Judge, is 100,000 TL worth alimony? Sir, sit down. Did I promise you? -Miss Judge, look, this man is me… -Okay, enough! I didn't promise. Look, I'll throw it out. Mr. Deputy, take care of it. Check it out though. I'm very sorry, sir. Listen, woman. -Yes, go ahead, lawyer lady. - Thank you, Your Honor. The psychological violence that my client has suffered during his marriage… God, I'm done. I swear I'm done. I was left without a lawyer at the most important hearing. Now they'll take me until my frostbite. -Oh my God… -Don't stop crying. Don't give up right now. There is Recep İvedik next to you. Relax. I will get you out of here. You leave it, leave it to me. Didn't you just say you're not a lawyer? I am not. I have nothing to do with being a lawyer, but I will do a better job than a lawyer. You can't be my lawyer or anything. Do you have any alternatives other than me right now? Do you have any alternative from me now? I'm your only way out. Do not. Calm down. Plaintiff's attorney was heard. Defendant was asked to defend his counsel. -Here you go, deputy. - Watch me now. I will say, Your Honor, and distinguished members of the jury, but the juror must be You do not use it in the Ayvalık region. No because. Therefore, I would like to start my words as follows. Your Honor! Can you see an adjective of that? Can you take a look at this adjective? Excuse me, donkey farts on your face, sir. Can you take a look at that adjective, that adjective? It has officially turned into a medlar. It's a shackled donkey. This man worked day and night nonstop. Day and night, I say, Miss Judge, day and night. Why? To make this woman happy. -This man… Do you have children? -I have got a son. He has one son from this woman, a man who has a stable child. Let's see if he pulls his hand away one day, let's ask that boy. Let's ask! Why didn't he pull? Because this man is the father. It's father, father! Babos. Babo this man, babo! This is a man who, without thinking of himself for an ounce, is only a father to that stubborn child. This is such a man. Isn't that worth it too? Your Honor, I object and please for the record. Feridun Bey spent even the gold that was worn in the childhood of his child in gambling and coin markets and did not replace it in any way. Damn boy, did you eat the baby's gold? Either I bought some coins, I made such a mixed basket, they all went bankrupt. Hey, let me put it in your character. Let me put it in the character of a man like you. Recep, what do you mean… [tongue clicks] Your Honor, sir, Feridun is human too. Like all people, Feridun can make mistakes. Mistake is for humans, sir. Yes, as Feridun is a complete commodity It's true, he bought all his wealth and invested the baby's gold in coins. False! I say it to your face too. Goods! False. I say it to your face. Goods! I'm saying look, property. Wrong sir. But, is this the end of our wrong life? Can't we hold on to any other human value? An idiot, a property, Are we going to spend it here just because he made a mistake? Does he have no humanity? Don't you have any conscience? It also has a heart. There's a tiny little pigeon heart over there. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. That's how he throws it. Shall we break this heart? There is one very important quality that this man has never had. Do you know what? Loyalty! Loyalty is what it's called. They call it monogamy Feridun in the neighborhood, monogamy Feridun. Because he is monogamous. He is loyal, he is a perfect, flawless personality that puts loyalty at the forefront. Isn't that worth it too? Does that even matter? Your Honor, the main reason for this lawsuit is Feridun Bey's infidelity. Video recordings and photos are available in the attached file, sir. What am I hearing? What am I hearing? Did you cheat on your wife? Did you cheat son? -It was a little getaway. -Tell the truth. -It wasn't a big deal. -Tell the truth! They're exaggerating, Recep. There is no such thing actually. God damn you! Yes, it's over I suppose? I will now decide. Sir, I would like to inform you of a decision we made jointly with Feridun. With all due respect to your decision. Sir, Feridun whispered deeply in my ear. She said that I have worn out this woman a lot. I bent this woman's head forward. Elimde, malımda, mülkümde babadan kalan ne varsa dedi, ben hepsini, bütün mal varlığımı bu kadına geçiriyorum dedi. On the record, sir. -What, how? What are you saying, Recep? -Shut the hell up! He said sir, I said no alimony, The lady said to give me alimony. Madam Judge, is there such a thing? -Sit down, sit down! Sir, I also have a special request from you. If there is CUMUK CIMIK in the law, it is a two-year solitary confinement. -Alone. Let him sleep and come to his senses. -What about solitary confinement? What are you saying, Recep? -Think about the shit he ate. -Is it okay? -There is no such thing. -Please be quiet. -But look, please. There can be no such thing. -Silence! Be quiet please. sit down! That is justice. The woman is one hundred percent right. AA. Recep. What are you doing here? Come here, get out. I'm sorry, ma'am, there must have been a misunderstanding. I wish you a good day. See you again in court. You made the right decision. Justice is the basis of property. Respects. -See you my sister. -Come on. Tuh, God bless you. He's tumbling in height. Late. Sorry again, take it easy. What are you doing? So, what is this outfit? Well, while I was waiting for you, I found it there because everyone was walking around like this, I put it on me. It fit very well though. AA. Good luck to me. Our eyes are clear. I won my first case, I cleared the guy. I always played women, always women. -What? -The information you want is here. -Hasbin… -All signed. Either the judge is waiting for us. Can you walk quickly? My God, my Lord! Dear Yutan Village residents. All of you are welcome, you brought joy. As Çökelek Holding, our philosophy is always to collapse… to solve… We built it on solving. Your problems are our problems. Of course, as we set out on this road, we had a real leader, I would like to give credit to my own uncle, Enver Çökelek, who is a true opinion leader. He has a video message for you. With your applause, my uncle Enver Çökelek, the chairman of the board of directors of our company, is before you. Here you go. I'm Enver Çökelek. I am the owner of Çökelek Holding. [promotional music] ♪ Looking at the world always smiling ♪ ♪ What a great man you are, Enver Çökelek ♪ I want it, it will. I say I will, I did. Çökelek Holding. 50 years of experience. Yutanbiance is the biggest project of Çökelek Holding. This project will either be done or will be done. When I came to Yutan Village years ago, I realized that this place has a different beauty. It doesn't matter, I said, "This place should be mine, it's mine." Then I met the healing Swallow mud. I had some friends with me. They said, "Brother, take this mud and rub it on your face. You are getting younger." I said God. So I took a handful, put this mud on my forehead. I swear, it's been 10 minutes, I'm almost younger. I said it's a miracle. Miracle! That's the day, I said I have to take this mud, put it on everyone's forehead. I hope we will put it on your forehead. We will put it on the forehead of the whole nation. Greetings everyone. Goodbye. Bravo uncle. Bravo uncle. Sir, now we are going to the signing ceremony. -When should we blow up the ceremony? -Yeah, everyone is lining up. I have a number. Wait for a sign from me. -OK. -Uncle Seyit, let's see. Come on, sign it. Selamun aleykum. -Best wishes. -Best wishes. -Let's sign it. -Best wishes. -Let's sign, four eyes. -I wish the best. Come on, sign it. Selamun aleykum. Look at me, don't try to act out like that, huh. No, no. No flooding. I'm here to sign too. By God, we have been very prejudiced towards Çökelek Holding. In other words, as I studied the project and got into it, I fell in love once again. Where are we signing? Good luck to you, Recep. Well, that would suit you too. Well done. You found the right way, I will take a picture with you, you deserve it. God bless you. Where are we signing now? -Over there. -Are we throwing it right here, Erdem Bey? -Hah, throw it here. -Here, right, Mr. Erdem? -Sure, throw it here, ready. -Yeah, okay. If the photographer is shooting here, we are looking right here, Mr. Erdem. Three, two, one. Here's your signature! Aha look, this is a wet signature! Nasty bastard! It's your fault in the castle area anyway. [Recep laughs] Mr. Erdem, you have spent so much money, but unfortunately, this project is a dream for a while. What do you mean dream? This sale cannot be made without the consent of these women. -[in unison] We don't have consent! -You can't sell! How? Can something like that happen? What are they saying, Asim? Erdem Bey, whatever the men say here. Women have no say. -How not! -What does it mean? Don't do it! The court never says so. The judge made the annulment, it passed. These women also have a say, understood? Semih, what the hell is this guy? What's this? Sir, the headman directed us that way. What do you say, my brother, that the headman is the headman? Gee. I feel bad, I can't breathe. -Pick it up! -Recep! [Laughs] Okay okay. What happened tonic? Ha? I see that your mood is broken, your hair is also broken. Wait a minute. A! It was worth my hair too. Take me to the car. Take me away from here. Take it to the car. Let's go from here. ♪ The licorice turned purple ♪ ♪ Dumbbell dumbelek stole behind your back ♪ ♪ Oh, you'll be hungover like that, Nah, you'll get an inch from this village ♪ ♪ Oh, you'll be hungover like that, Nah, you'll get an inch from this village ♪ Let's trust someone one day so that we don't explode anywhere! Mr. Erdem, what have we seen in the real estate sector? Those who go to the deed and return without signing, such things. What does this have to do with the real estate sector, what does it have to do with his return from the title deed? Ah, the phone is ringing. Look how painful it sounds. Sir Uncle? Put the phone on speaker. I'm taking it uncle one second. E, sir, you are on loudspeaker now, uncle. dude are you stupid? - Estagfurullah, my uncle. That thing… -Oh, you're not. Then you are retarded. Who is this man bro, who is he? E, huh… Which man is my uncle? The guy making the move at the signing ceremony. The photographer threw it all away, here it is. I am that photographer… -I do not understand. -Ha, you're saying... E, yes uncle, unfortunately there was someone there who created a small unpleasant incident and tried to go wild. But don't worry, we are very used to such situations. We deal with these kind of guys a lot when we go out on the field. After all, he is an ignorant peasant, sir. There is nothing to exaggerate. Of course dear. In the real estate industry… The startup is from the real estate industry. Are you telling me? Look at me, get that man over here right now. Now! There is no need, uncle. What you need… Hello? Hello. Ha. The village is the place, of course, the phone does not receive, it is closed. No, no, I think he just hung up on you. If it wasn't, it would make such zang zung, zing zung sounds. In that respect. Am I going to explain to you? He came to me and says zang zung. Go find this man as soon as possible, take him to my uncle immediately. -Okay? -Respects. In the meantime, good luck. You made a big event this morning. Thank you. Anyone in my place would have done the same. No, he wouldn't have done it. Look, make sure everyone was quiet. Thank you, God bless. Oh look, look, who's coming. Selamun aleykum. Mashallah, happy faces are smiling. -Is there a permit? -No, you're not allowed. We solve puzzles among ourselves in a private way. Yahu Recep, what did you do in the signature today? Erdem Bey was astonished. I swear, even I wouldn't have thought of it, what a hell you are, Recep. Let there be love. [Laughs] [Laughs] Tell him to bellow like a goat whatever you have to say. A phone call just came from above. From the very beginning of the holding, from the top. Enver Çökelek called. Really? What does Enver Çökelek say? She is very upset today. He said, "Find that child and bring him." He said let me talk to that conscious, sensitive child and explain myself. -So the ambassador will not be disappointed, Recep. -You see, don't you, Nurullah? Chief butler Enver Çökelek is calling us to his feet. Recep, don't say that. We'll go to the old man's feet, of course. Our customs require it. Cut and cut. Will we learn customs from you after this age? Okay, tell Enver Çökelek, he will meet with you, too, Recep İvedik. huh. Then I'll take the office vehicle and come. No? We don't get into the office car you ride with the people's money, coach. Your weather won't hurt us. I didn't buy it with public money. Enver Bey donated the car to the headman's office. Don't you understand bullshit? Well, Asım, I'll clear your head again, huh. I will come with my own car. Wait for me at the exit of the village, I will follow you. Well okay. I'm waiting huh. We go back to back. [playful music player] Mr. Enver. Then after. You know, there was Recep İvedik you wanted to host? -Ha. -I brought him. OK, wait there. -He is with you right now. -What? Hey, I'm here. I am here, in front of you. Bloody alive, look. It's not virtual either. It's real, look. Is your name Recep? He is Recep İvedik. Sit down late. Don't gesture to me like that, son. You will talk to me like a man. You will not speak to me in the imperative. Take a seat, Mr. Recep, you will say. Here you go, Mr. Recep. Yeah like that. Be smart, be a man. -Come on, leave us alone. -Len! Yes, you called, we came, what are we going to talk about? Huh, like this. Let's have dessert, talk sweet, shall we? What are these? These are 22 carat gold plated dragon fruit desserts. Where did you get these? Did you buy it from the covered market? I did not understand. No, I have a special cook, this is how he makes desserts, decorates them with gold. dude, are you sick? Are you a maniac? Are you mentally ill, son? Are you uncomfortable? People do ten somersaults on the way to the wedding to wear a quarter of gold, do you put gold on the dessert and eat it here? What kind of life is this? What kind of lifestyle is this? Let's say now I ate this, gold. Suppose we bought it for 10 liras. I ate, gold fell to seven liras. What will I do? You can't take a shit. At least you think that I can keep it inside me so that we don't do any harm. -Just eat. -No no. I can't eat 22 karat. This is probably 22 gauge. I can't eat other than 24, it makes me gas. You know. Mr. Recep, take a look around. what do you see? I'm looking at something like this... I see one artificial pond. It's full of shit. That makes a fly. It's a filthy place. One stone house in the back, too big for you. And I see a lonely old man waiting for death, that's all. Hah, that old old man, the owner of all the beauties you see and count. Now he will bring the same beauties to your village. I will make a corner of heaven just like this place. Thanks brother. We do not need the heaven you will create. Our village is already an idyllic place, do you understand? Just don't touch your hand, we don't want anything else. What a nonsense person you are. I've been speaking beautifully all along, but you're forcing me. What if I force you brother? Ha? Let me see, what will happen when I force you? Look, my lion, don't cross the line! You are smart man. Your intuition is strong. Take your receivables, take care of your way, let go of this business. Here you go. What is this? What did you write here? Did you write your TC ID, what is this? The number I intend to give you, I wrote it down. -Ha, you wrote me a lot of checks. -I wrote a check. Is there a check left? 1970 model pieces. Switch to blockchain until you put virtual glasses on your eyes. You should at least offer Bitcoin. Take your check and steal it on your head. We don't need your check or your money, son. Look, I'm telling you once and for all. Whether you want it or not, even if the whole village stands up, that project will be built there. Did you understand? Oh, if you try to prevent it, you will suffer the consequences now. -What are the results brother? Let's know. -I'll burn, I'll burn! That's how you know it. OK? You must have thought we were yesterday's children. We are the baby of Güngören, son. These dry threats of yours will not work against us. The disaster you will create will be a festival for us, brother. Do your best. Get your hands off our skirts and make up your mind. Don't mind me. Come on, stay safe. Geh, geh, geh, geh, geh, geh. Geh, geh, geh, geh, geh, geh, geh. What's going on here bro? What is it, what? What are you doing? What? Mr. Erdem. Someone with sheep came, Mr. Erdem. Hey! What's going on here? Virtue! Virtue! What are you doing here bro? Come, I'll show you around with your friends, "crack head!" [Laughs] -Are you sick bro? -What are you doing, asshole, huh? Construction has also stopped, you're sitting idly by, aren't you? Ha? You know, you were the huge Çökelek Holding? Ha? It was getting 50 percent. You'll find my shit 50 percent. Look beautiful bro. We're builders, okay? We know how to wait, don't worry. We are used to these situations. Look at me, if you have a bell, come and lead these. You are a leader spirit. [Laughs] Just go, for God's sake. Don't find the trouble on us. Come on, go. Take the cottage cheese! Take the cottage cheese! Collapse precipitate. Knife pocket knife precipitate. What the hell is this? Cakir cracked cottage cheese. Cakir cracked cottage cheese. Laughing rose lily cottage cheese. Laughing rose lily cottage cheese. -Come on, walk! -I don't understand what kind of man you are. Geh, geh, geh, geh, geh, geh, geh, Virtue! Geh, geh, geh, geh, geh, Virtue! Geh, geh, geh, geh, geh, geh, geh. Huh. The moon is beautiful. Look at the consistency of this. -This is perfect. -Oh, give it. -[Recep] [clicks tongue] Look at this. -Healing the moon. I mean, look at what educated, cultured, university graduates, law graduate women are doing. It means that ignorance remains. What does it matter? What a beautiful healing mud. Shouldn't we take advantage of that too? What a beautiful skin, it brightens and tightens Recep. Who told you this? Who told you that this place makes it beautiful? If not, will Çökelek Holding be torn because I will come and establish a facility? What if we take it out and send it to the laboratory for an analysis, the laboratory will shut it down. You're exaggerating a little now. This mud exists so that animals can come and cool themselves. The animal comes, pours itself out of the mud, cools its body. His intestines are working, he is lying on his side. [blows] He says. [imitates defecation sound] He's letting go. good. Filthy. You take it too, you rub it on your face. That's enough. Uff, you made us nauseous. Even if this mud is healing, would the women of our village be like this? I remember in the past, there was an aunt Necla, she put it on her face, she had a beard. Bearded woman. -Tell the truth. -He left and left. He left the village. Well, why didn't you tell us that from the beginning? We drove it all over us, Recep. [clicks tongue] Nothing happens at once. He practiced for two years. Currently in Manisa. He lives in mental illness. [electric saw sound] A minute! -What happened? -Shhh. -What is it? -Wait a minute. [reverse warning beeping] -Do you hear, Nurullah? -There is a sound, brother. Truck movement sound with chainsaw sound. No more moon. A! Or did they set the construction in motion, Büşra? God bless you! Get up now, tell the villagers quickly. Let's meet at the door, quick. -Get up, we're going too. Get up, let's go. -Recep. A minute. How can I come like this? -Quick, quick, quick. -Moon! [cheer] The villagers are here, where is the curd? -The villagers are here, where is the cottage cheese? -Turn it off, turn it off. Bursstt! Slow down. Slow! No, what a crowd, what's going on here? What's really going on with you? We stopped your construction here with a court decision. You work very hard, we hear it with our ears. My dear brother, we have already overturned that court decision you have taken in a higher court. Son, give me the file. -Here you go, sir. -Let me see. -I don't understand, look at this, Büşra. -Is this a supreme court decision? -Yes. -Hmm. Did you handle it as a lawyer? -Yes. -[imitates] Yeah. I said if my uncle steps in, he'll get it done, right? What does Büşra say, did they stop the decision? Wait a minute, I'm looking. Normally they don't make such a decision. What did you do to make such a decision? What did you give? Did you give money? Did you give money? Did you buy a man? No no. No money giving. Where did it come from? We just negotiated with the new owners. Well, what a coincidence, when the 50 percent majority was found again, the court changed the decision in our favor, right? Thanks to the realtor. Aha! What did you say? No, no, I didn't say. -You said real estate agent, son. -I didn't say no. -You said real estate agent, I heard it with my own ears. -No, no, I didn't say. I didn't say realtor. -Real Estate… Did you hear that too? -Yes! -You said real estate agent. -There is no real estate agent. Which realtor did you deal with? Which realtor did you work with? No bro, no real estate agent, come on. You'll be careful who you mess with from now on, okay? Oh, by the way, ma'am. Do you know what you did to your face it was amazing? -It reflects you, huh. - They slept in the mud, Mr. Erdem. -Come on press go man! -Laugh you crunchy crunchy, no problem. Our legal battle will continue, okay? This is not over here, know it like this. Run it. Run it. Büşra, I can only think of a real estate agent around here. -Isn't that right, friends? -Yes! Let's go and have a talk with him. The matter will be clear then. Go Nurullah. [plays menacing music] You wait here, Nurullah. Make it to the erk. Ok bro. Selamunaleykum mukhtar. Aleykumselam, brother Recep. Welcome. They said there is someone dealing with real estate around here. We were also going to look at some properties. E, I already told you you're a realtor, remember? How did you look? I was looking for something like this. Ah! Ah! What's going on? How did they find 50 percent? How did they find it? Wait, let me love your eyes, stop, calm down. OK, I'll explain. These guys, look, they're very strong men. I was consulting them. When the villager stopped selling... -TO? I sold the ones with power of attorney. Of course it wasn't enough. The village had common areas, it stood empty. Whether it's the headman's office, the council of elders, the village square, etc. I have allocated this for 49 years. -Of course, dear, don't let it sit idly, right? -Is not it? Ah! Ah! Wait, let me kiss your feet, Recep. I love your eyes. Look, I made it for my nephews. They said they would fire me. If you love your God, don't shoot anymore. Damn, is it a forbidden bite for your nephews? Huh, is it the place? Since you sold the village, my son, I will not let you stay in this village anymore, headman. -Make up your mind! -Ah! Expect trouble from me, mayor. Expect trouble from me! Go away! Recep bro! Recep bro! Recep bro! Brother, such a notification came to the school. What is this? I didn't fully understand. Let me see, maybe I'll understand. Aha. He says evacuate the school. They gave 30 days. You vacate the school within 30 days. Evacuation? Well, where do we go? There are so many students in the school. Also, what does school have to do with it? What if this clumsy headman had transferred everything, the common area of ​​the village, the school, the construction company, to the construction company. I've already beaten him on this subject. But now that the commitment has come, I'm going to stick it once. Recep bro! Recep brother, there is no brother. It's not like that. I say, let's go to the council of elders of our village, let's explain the situation well. Let's ask their opinion. Come on, let's talk. What happened to them son? Aren't they dead? No, brother, they are upset because they are old. Uncle İhsan is the president, if you want a nudge. Uncle Ihsan? Uncle Ihsan? Uncle Ihsan! Hey to your father's donkey... Uncle İhsan, they are selling the village here, you are sleeping soundly. -What kind of a council of elders is this? -Who? What? - Uncle İhsan, there is a headman. -Yes. The headman has given this council of elders building to the contractors for 49 years. They will challenge you from here. They're going to kick your ass. What? Did they sell the council of elders building? The elders are our red line. Nobody can wash, nobody can sell. How do your ears hear when it comes to your work? I said the council of elders, the tip touched you, you started to hear right away. We need to send this headman from the village urgently. We don't want this headman anymore. What are we going to do to send this headman? Very simple. We have a century-old tradition. You will call the headman to the square, you will quarrel. No, Uncle İhsan, don't talk nonsense. Are we going to shoot a man in the village square from now on? We can't shoot like that. I can't hold a gun, no. Uncle İhsan, what are you saying? Does such a thing ever happen? What weapon? You will have a love affair with words, not with a gun, but with a saz. No, no, I can't. Definitely. I can't do it, Uncle İhsan, I certainly can't. Yes, friends, we're here for the lovers' bickering. Recep on my right, Asım on my left. Good luck to you all. Come on ladies, come on. Bravo! What happened, huh? Your face went slow. You're surprised, aren't you? -Are we going to shoot with women? -We're going to argue with women, don't you like it? What happened, did you shave your head man? What will I be afraid of you?

What happened? The people were good at choosing you. You couldn't fit in the sky. Is it bad now that he didn't choose you and sent you? Whatever the people say, that's my son. Walk away from here. If you have so much honor, pride and dignity, you will get the hell out of this village. Walk! -Get up too. -Walk! Go go! [in unison] Whoops! Shame on the effort I gave. [in unison] Muhtar Recep. Mukhtar Rex. Mukhtar Rex. Thank you, thank you. Thanks brother. Thanks, sister. Thank you. Thanks. From now on, a completely different, clean page will open for Yutan Village. Bravo! Ha. Anyway, there is no way to lie down on Recep because we are the headman. You will make a choice as soon as possible. You will protect your village and find your new headman. -He's right. -He's right. But until then, I'm the mayor. Muhtar in the house. That's it. Mukhtar Rex. Mukhtar Rex. Hello. Good day Sir. Ministry of Labor and Social Security? I was going to file a complaint. Recep İvedik, headman of Yutan Village. Either there is a construction site and if you send an authorized person, let's check this place. Don't be silly, sir. What report? What inspection? Cut it out! Get your hands down! The state is standing in front of you! [playful music player] You know, I saw it the other day, a man is carrying a plank, his friend is the digger operator, he is panning his friend with the tip of the bucket. The man says what is going on. I took a look in the air. Does such a thing happen? Is such a thing possible, sir? But the fish stinks from the head. Here you are. He's a very unworthy, unqualified scumbag. His uncle put this here. His hand does not hold bread. Are you a university graduate? Brother, I graduated from two universities in America. Why didn't you study in Turkey? Since you are such a Turkish citizen. Why didn't you read here? Ungrateful! What was not enough for you here? They didn't buy it here, it's obvious to the school, his uncle had it taught there with his money. You don't have money for everything. Rich baby la you. La rich baby, filthy baton baton. [the music continues] [gag] It has to stay a while. For him to feel. Good day, are you PICKING? They work double shifts 24 hours a day. The men became like zombies. Come check it out here. Follow me sir. I told you. A large number of uninsured workers are employed in this workplace. Let's give it a try now. Do you believe? Are you insured son? -No, I get daily wages. -Here you go. My boss is lying. This is a friend of this, they know each other. Cut it out! The government doesn't lie! Your name is on the back of it. Is my name written here? This is your name! Have a nice day. Ministry of Health? Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs? Pizza guy? Two medium size. Pineapple, paprika, jalapeno. Hello, good day. Ministry of Environment and Urbanization? Hey, I was going to meet with an official. Honorable Minister, my respects. How did they connect you directly? I won't keep you busy. Shall we transfer it to the private pen, Minister? Hello. Good afternoon, Fire Department? It is necessary to conduct an audit, I am the headman of Yutan Village. There is a construction here. Well, they have no preparations. huh. A fire extinguisher caught my eye. Sir, you can see what you want. Pre-construction friends have already tested all of them. Is not it? - Shall we tighten it, manager? -Squeeze, squeeze. Let's take it. Pin it. I threw. Three, two, one. Bass, it's empty. -It's empty, look, look. -Does it suit you? Shame on you! Is human life that cheap? Where, I can't see the lightning rod? It's not just you, I can't see it either. Nobody can see it because it doesn't exist. Where is the lightning rod? Where is my son lightning rod? Sir, we had it installed, but they must have stolen it at night. We did, we had. We were obsessed. I will be your lightning rod, my friend. By Allah, did you eat the lightning bolt to your brain? They get 20 million volts out of your ass here huh! You'll be shining brightly here at night, like a night light, huh. Sir, there will probably be a sanction for this. Yes, the report is finished. If you sign here. I read, I understand, your name. Skip the summer penalty, sir. Unfortunately, I will write an administrative fine for this. Hurry! Administrative fine for you. What if the general is standing in front of you, general! So is there a penalty like this, but sir? I'm closing this business until I get the lightning rod. -Oo… -I will give information to the necessary places. -Scramble the blackboard! -Mr. Muhtar! Hurry! Punish you here. Add! Come on brother, come on. For God's sake, please take this man with you. -They put the punishment on you! -Sir, please. I'm so sorry, sir. I am very sorry. -Two days for him too. -Add two more days. They punished him for hashing. Punish you for snapping! Write, write. I will ask you. My uncle will show you the rustling. How did we become such a nuisance to the men? You stand still, stand still. When the Ministry of Labor imposes a penalty on them, then you see Enver Çökelek's facial expression. He will smash his virtue, like this. My only son, what kind of shit is he? I also went into that toilet. I swear you fucked up like a high five. I've been holding it for three days, for him, brother. I swear you also left it shaped like a python snake. The inspector at the Ministry of Labor looked at it and said I will ask for an assignment. He said that this is not so. He said get it from here like this with a vacuum truck. -[bottle breaking sound, flaming sound] -Aha! Did that voice come from us? I don't know bro. My mother, the car is on fire, Nurullah! Nurullah the car is on fire! -Approach. Brother, don't come close. -The car is on fire, Nurullah! -Nurullah, we need to put this out! -Don't come close, bro! Nurullah the car is on fire! The Red Devil is on fire, man. -Brother, it explodes. -It won't explode, Nurullah. -Explodes, explodes. -It won't explode! Let's turn this off! -Nurullah, my car is on fire. -Explodes! -They'll explode, brother. -I say it won't explode, son, it won't explode! I say it won't explode, son. It won't explode, it won't explode. I had the gas tank of the car made with a skid. The warehouse is at home, it won't explode! When I said I'm going to tell you something, the car burned down and turned into ashes. My God, my Lord, the Red Devil is on fire, the Red Devil! Burned Red Devil! Burned Red Devil! You see, don't you, Nurullah? They burned the Red Devil like a rose. Look, it's still smoldering, smoldering. Hey go hey. What memories do we have with you, Red Devil. Gungoren cauldron, you scoop, what a trip we've been through, Red Devil. -Ah! -Aha look who came, Nurullah. -Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! -Go turn off the water. -How could it be? -Burnt. I was very sorry! I'm so sorry, how could such a thing happen, Asim? My dear villager brother Recep, I mean, there have been some misunderstandings with you before, There have been conflicts, but you are my neighbor. I mean, we're looking at each other's faces here. We will get through these difficult times together. As soon as we heard it, we immediately ran. Is there anything we can do? Thank you, thank you, and God bless... -Why did you come? -I came to say get well soon, Recep. I mean, is humanity dead or not? We have been acquainted for so many years. I also moved to the private sector. I'm at Yutanbiance with Mr. Erdem. Really? Best wishes. Well. We wanted to grow a little as a company. It was a very important addition. Yes, yes, they added you very well, Erdem. In other words, you have created a very nice ambiance with two different types of curmudgeons. Well done to you. Shh look at me. They gossip about you in the village. -About us? -How so? They say they have a relationship. Now I don't know if it's financial or something else. -Who says? -Come, come closer. Come closer, I'll say your name. -Ah! -Walk, go! Go away! -It's my fault when it comes to you. -Walk go! Sir, leave it alone, he is an incompetent person. Is there a retard in front of you? Ha? God's idiots. You see, don't you, Nurullah? Now we are completely sure. There is a rule in the illegitimate realm. Nurullah is the one who does the first thing to get well soon. E bro, then when the tube exploded at your house last year, I was the first to come. Did I make the tube? What does that have to do with it? What does that have to do with it? My car is already on fire, I'm pissed off, why are you bothering me? -Go get me my Ka-Ka-Der agenda. -Here you go, brother. Hello. Good afternoon ma'am. I was going to log in with the emergency code. Yes, I am a member, 3169 Recep İvedik. Of course I do, one second. "You said let's go to your death, but we said there is no diesel, honey." Heh, we need four trucks here urgently. Yutan Village, Kozak region. Yes, come right away. Thank you, thank you, my dear, thank you, have a nice day. Here we will meet you now, Çökelek Holding. Let's see how it goes. -[truck horn sounds] -[threatening music] Bursstt! Slow down! Selamunaleykum dear ones. -Aleykumselam. -Hi brother. You said come, we came, brother Recep. We are at your service, master. Let's hit it, let's break it, Recep Abi. Thank you, do not miss. Come with me. Friends, we are starting our hunger strike for our village. Teacher, come on. Let's take a nice video of us. It's pathetic, it's a heart touching video about the human drama here. Do you understand? Ready bro. Yes, you see, we tied ourselves to the tree with chains. For what? We are doing all this to stop this construction. We started our hunger strike. We expect the intense interest of the press here soon. We will not give up, if necessary, you will find our bodies tied and in chains, but we will not give up on this hunger strike. -Did you captured it? -I took it bro. OK, very nice. You organized the full participation press, didn't you? I told them all. I texted each and every one of them. Very nice. Look at me son. This strike is a very serious strike. No matter what I say, don't worry, you're not unraveling us. -Okay bro, we got it. -Deal? Hunger can create all kinds of states in a person. It makes me particularly aggressive. I can threaten you. I say I'll cut off your head, I'll stab you, I'll tell my master, I'll lay you under the tree, I say I'll say all kinds of things, wait for me. But you still don't solve it, do you understand son? All right, Recep brother, we have a deal. It only takes two things for you to untie us. Fainting and death. We want to go all the way, got it? Ok bro, we got a deal. OK. Come on guys. May our Gaza be blessed! -Blessed be the chief. -Blessed be the chief. Shh, should we have had a drink of water before we started? Have you started the strike son? It started bro. We couldn't drink water either, our mouth is sticky on our tongue. -No, what's going on here? - They went on a hunger strike, Mr. Erdem. -On a hunger strike? -Yes. What if he can't stand that chubby hunger, he already eats the people next to him in that third minute. -How many minutes has it been? -Recep brother, it's been 47 minutes right now. How about 47? How about 47 minutes? Three and a half, four hours passed, my stomach clock says so, my body clock. It works just as well. -Where is the press, son? -I talked bro, they will come. What about? What about? What about the press? He didn't come. Look, my nerves started to play, slowly, aggression started, if you are aware. Someone is coming. Someone is coming. -What happened, sister? -You're on strike? We brought you food in case you're hungry. -Sister, we are on hunger strike, hunger! -It's okay, you can eat when you're hungry, gari. Or do you not understand the word? This isn't a normal strike, it's not. You think this is a labor union strike? Hunger strike! It's not "you eat when you're hungry, gari". We can't eat when we're hungry, gari! We can't eat when we're hungry, gari! We try not to eat, you bring trays of food. They also put chicken on bulgur pilaf. Are you trying to be a hindrance to us, are you trying to be a support, ladies? -Please go. -What do we know, dear? Please. Not this way, but yeah. Shall we take a spoon? Shh, let me get a spoon from him. Come here. Give me a chicken leg. -Well, I can't do it, son, untie me. -No. -Untie me, son. -No, Recep brother, no. -Solve it. -Not possible. God give me patience. God, give me strength. Aa… A… Nurullah. Nurullah. Yes bro. -Are you eating lentil meatballs? -What patties? -Are you eating lentil meatballs? -What meatball bro? Come on, the ball exploded? Is it the ball? It's not Ramadan, it's nothing, what ball bro? The ball just exploded. Wow, it exploded. God give me patience. How are you guys, are you okay? We are fine. We are used to hunger, brother. -We are super, brother. -We're fine too, chief. You're used to my shit, my shit! On the long road, you stop and drink soup at every facility every 45 minutes. I'm done, untie me son. Untie me son. How many hours has it been? -Recep brother, we passed five hours, brother. -How much? [harp sound] -Pst. What are you doing here son? -Are you talking to me right now? -I'm talking to you, yes. -I'm fine, what are you doing? Oh well, what should I do, I just went out to graze. We are also on a hunger strike. -Good, take it easy. What are you eating son? Give it to us too, I love your eyes, we are very hungry. I can't give it. Aren't you on strike? Give me some goat cheese. What about Recep, who lost the goat cheese and who finds it, for God's sake? But a nice baked beans for you, a nice buttered rice with it, okay? It says beans. What dried beans… It is very difficult. Do you have any dried beans? Run to the village, run gallop, run to the village, bring beans. Quadruple run. Okay, okay, okay. Let's take it easy. [voice echoes] Recep brother? Receptionist? -Sorry? -Rep bro. -Sorry? -Who are you talking to? - Son, weren't you a goat? -No, bro. What goat? Your adjective was goat just now. I swear I saw a goat. You were just a white-bearded goat. Brother, Recep brother. Look, you're not good at all, huh. So your head is pretty much gone. Come to yourself. I've been very bad, my son. untie me. I've been very bad. I just saw you goat. I started a conversation with you as a goat. Untie me, I've been so bad, please. No bro, we talked about it, you said don't solve it, I can't do anything. Okay, I'm telling you solve it now. Right now, I'm telling you to untie me immediately. But Recep brother, we talked about this too. You said solve. I said that too, I said untie me! I'm the one who said that, I'm the one who said that too. If I told you to untie me, you will untie me. Who gave you that order? -You gave it, bro. I'm giving this order too. Okay, but you said that too. If I say that, don't solve it, you said. Are you going to make me hurt me? I'm giving the order. Untie me right here. You said don't solve it except death and fainting. That's why I don't fix it. God, give me patience. Aa, something is happening to me. Aa, my brain is out of power right now. Look, look, I'm going, look, slowly. -Rep bro! -Look, look, look. My eyes are slipping. -Rep bro! -[groans] - Brother, I'm here. -Recep? Recep? Passed out, sir. Solve, solve. - Chief, come to your senses. Head? -[groans] Uff. Well, hunger strike is not for me at all. The press had no interest at all. Nor was it created a sensation. We floundered there for nothing. We urgently need to find someone famous here. Otherwise, the press is not interested. Brother Recep, a friend of mine works for the company that makes RSVPs to galas. I think he has it, let me ask you a question. Wouldn't it be okay, son, if your friend is already working in RSVP, he has the whole list. Tell me to send it quickly. E, okay I'm asking. Let me check quickly. Write and send the list. Quick, quick, quick. Did he send the list? Has the list arrived? I'm writing bro, stop. Let me see if it came? Have you got the list, son, look. Hah, I sent it. Is the list here, check it out. My brother was sending it in two minutes. Look son, it beeped beeping. He trembled, my son, look at him. Has the list arrived? -Come on. -Aha, it's here. -Brother, I swear he's here. -Give, give, give, give. Aha, the list is here. Let's start with the first now. Fazil Say. It's not alphabetical, is it? Hello. Good day Sir. Is it Cemal Resit Rey? Hey, would you look at the backstage, I was going to meet with Fazil? Who is Fazil? Fazil Say, who will it be? Who else is Turkey's pride? Take a look, it's over there. We also think that there will be a social responsibility concert around Yutan Village. Such a beautiful meadow will put his piano in the middle of the grass, it will rattle. We will also call the press. No, how can we find the piano? We can't find the piano. No, we don't have a piano. How does it not? We invited a clarinetist to the last wedding, he came with his own clarinet. He will take his grand piano, he will come, brother. Is there an artist who does not bring his own gold coin? How big is it? Whatever my brother has a big tool, we are not interested in his tool. It will ring here. I can arrange org here, org. Okay, close, okay. Art basket. Empty works. Hello, I was going to see Tarkan. We either have a social responsibility business or in our Yutan Village. Yes. There will be a construction here, there will be natural slaughter. We are waiting for Tarkan. Can't come? E is going to Hasankeyf. He knew how to travel there. He's singing "Lucky, late", I swear he didn't pass. So they passed us by. Okay, ma'am, close, okay. Hello. I was going to meet with Ezel. Yes. What if we wanted nostalgia, good days, social responsibility? We are planning such a concert around Yutan Village for this trio. Wow, it was an unforgettable trio. Which trio? Ezel, Celik, Ercan. It's Ezel. Isn't it Ezel's song, "We were going to have a daughter, I'm on the road without my daughter." Isn't that Ezel? Is it special? Who Was Ezel? Rapper? No, no, no, we don't get rappers, no. in Berlin? No, I can't bring it from Berlin anyway. I'll bring it from Bolu at most. OK. OK. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. No brother, we couldn't meet anyone on a common point. Brother, I have a friend but… -Who? -Murat Dalkilic. Where is Murat Dalkılıç your friend from? -Brother from Wing Chun. -Call quick, call. Call if he comes. -We haven't seen each other for a long time though. -Call, call. Seek to talk. -What is he saying? -It's ringing, brother, it's ringing. What is he saying? What is he saying? Hello Murat. How are you? I missed you too, brother. Murat, I know that you are warm to social projects. E, we were going to invite you somewhere to shoot a video. To Yutan Village. Will you be free? Can you come! I already knew you were a nice person. I'll put you in position now. Deep down, deep down, my dear Murat. I love you, kiss you. Brother is coming. I swear you caught a mouse since it was a cat, Nurullah. Well done. Uff. Look at this. What time is it, he's still not around. -It will come, my brother, it will come. -How come? I swear I'm sick of this artist team. Come to a place on time, brother. Be a little human. Brother Murat is not like that. -Aha, it's here. Aha, it came. -I swear he's here. I swear it came. Nuro! -Wow, grasshopper! -You haven't changed at all! -Oh! Welcome. Welcome. -Thank you. -[laughs] You forgot. -[Laughs] Let me introduce you, my friend Recep. My best friend from the neighborhood. -Recep. -Selamun aleykum brother. -Hello. -Welcome. Wow, how different does television make people? I thought you were huge, like "keyhulan", you were pretty bored. You only have that song "To the bottom, deeper to the bottom" That song is so good. Deeper, deeper. Well, that's what I said already. It's at the bottom. Deeper, deeper. Thanks. -Like bro. -Uh. Let's go to the construction site right away, Murat. Let's not keep you waiting any longer. Let's get our video done. Well, okay. Where is that construction? Sister Aunt, you take a break in the cafe, we have a job. Not aunt, my manager. Ayşe. Manager, sit down to the cafe late, your feet are not available, you will scratch your feet. Where is Murat, I'm there. Thank you. Well, what shall we do then, let's go together. Here you go. Wow, wow, wow! They destroyed the beautiful forest. How do you sing with your artistic sensibility? They pretty much fucked up in the forest. They destined it. That's why we called you. We invited a valuable voice artist like you, who has millions of followers, here. With such a sad, emotional awareness video, do you understand? I'm with Yutan Village, I'm against this Yutanbiance, we need to shoot a video like this and gasp someone like Yutan, Murat. Okay, so I can gas that video to millions... Oh, I ate your mouth. Where shall we go, here? Let's shoot a good video. Come on bro. Get behind me. -Has everyone got a seat? - Aunt, you come too. -A, no, no, I will not come. -Is it good like that? Hello dears. I'm in Yutan Village right now and I'm very angry. You will understand why I am so angry and you will agree with me. That disgusting project you see behind me is destroying this beautiful forest and making it concrete. A vile company called Çökelek Holding is in the middle of these beautiful forests. He made a project called Yutanbiance and started to concrete these beautiful forests. Together with my peasant brothers, we have come here to resist so that these beautiful forests are not destroyed. Don't forget, #Utanbiance, #Defolçökelek! -God damn you all! -Thank you. -Brother, your hit was great. -Thanks. By God, I thought you wouldn't be able to finish it either, but you put it together very well. By the way, it's like I told your followers to goddamn it, you can fix that too. Shh, look, come on, post this nicely so that millions can see this, come on. Well, what time is it now? What are you going to do, share the time, son. Let's put it on at eight o'clock. Because it's eight prime time times. That is when you have the most interaction. Are you the national channel, son? You are a romantic prince in this country once. You have the freedom to put it wherever you want, whenever you want, however you want, to whomever you want. It's not me, you. Shall I put it or you? Don't you put it? This is how it is. Put this on, come on. Let me love your eyes. Okay, let's do it this way, trust me, I'll tweet at eight o'clock that I'll have very important news. After that, I think this will be over. Well, if you're the master of this business, then it's worth listening to. Isn't it Nurullah? After all, when we call a water heater to our house, we trust him. It's the same head. Good luck to your heart, I'm glad you came, my brother. Thanks. E, is that all Nuro? We've come this far, let's eat and drink well, let's take us somewhere. Well, the man is right. Shame on you. Why are you friends with this ox? You will hang with me, Murat. Stick with me, live your life. Let's take Necati to your brother's place. -Let's take it, brother. -I'm going to make you eat such a meal... -Come my lion, come. -Wonderful! Thank you. Murat! But Murat. How did you like the place? I built you a riverbank. It couldn't be more beautiful. Thank you very much. Is not it? -Yes. Look here, son. Lad. [kiss] Look here. -Welcome bro. -Thank you. Look, I brought you the most famous man you've ever seen. Murat Dalkilic. You can't see it in your dream, you see it in your place, you sit at your table, you see it, don't you? We will provide a very good service, do not embarrass us. Do not worry. Brother, what should I make you do, what would you like? Now let's do it this way, you make us turn a beautiful lamb, okay? Let it cook in a heavy fire, we will talk. Oh, I don't eat meat alone, dears. I'm vegan because of that. Hey, he doesn't eat meat. Then you know what to do, boy, get it from the trout farm over there, have a trout on a tile in butter, okay? Let me love Recep's eye, fish or meat. -Fish meat. -Meat. - Aren't you eating that too? -I'm not eating. -E, you are vegan. -Full. -Brother, mushroom? - Huh, it's a mushroom. Look, mushroom, he said right. A nice mushroom ember. Good, our mushroom here is very famous Murat. -The mushroom that swallowed it is legendary. -OK. Only brother, it's not mushroom season, we don't have it right now. How is it not the season of mushrooms? On the way… Mushrooms are everywhere, we saw it. -But I'm not sure about them. -What do you mean, I'm not sure bro? The Swallow mushroom we know. We have been eating since childhood. -Is it a lie? -What we always eat. Are we going to say no? Are we going to say no to the customer? Go collect it. It's none of my business. I'm not taking any responsibility, man. -Okay, okay, don't get involved. Go collect it. -Alright. But what if we don't eat what we don't know? The man says he is not sure. No sister, no. The mushroom we know, the mushroom we eat. It's what we always eat. And we're going to wrap the pine cone paste. Vegan pine cone paste, so we are suckers. Wow. We're sitting on the bank of that river with the huge Murat Dalkılıç. Did it ever occur to you? Murat, I will ask you a question if it is not private. -Of course. - Aunt, plug your ears. Who are you hanging out with from this art community now? -Come on, let me love Recep's eyes. -Tell me, tell me. At the beginning of forty years, we come together in this beautiful place… Tell me, tell me. Here we are us. -No no. OK. -Well, let's not force it. Recep, mushroom is also mushroom. I had it specially made for you. I sautéed it in a casserole. -Will you take my sister? -E, thank you, thank you. -See death. -I won't eat bro, thank you. He cries. He cries. He cries. I won't take it, pull it out. What about your eyes, my love? You found such a fresh, crimson mushroom at the beginning of forty years. Eat it! I will not eat Murat. You ate too much too, stop eating this, please. Imm. My dear, whoever eats this mushroom, regrets it, -and the one who doesn't eat it regrets it. -Ah! -My mother! -What happened? -What happened? -My mother! My mother, my mother, my mother. What happened Murat? Mom, I have a pain in the back of my head, right here, stop. Where exactly? What happened to you Murat? What should I know, Ayşe? It came in from somewhere. -A, a, a! It may be an ohmicron variant. Moon! Moon! Moon! Gee. What happened Murat? Try to explain it to me exactly. -Ah! I do not know. The child cannot put it into words. What is happening to you Murat right now? My eyes… Is it dark now? Is it dark now? -Murat, what darkening? -No, it's bright, Murat. Look at me. Murat? Murat, what's wrong with you? I guess he doesn't see, the boy looks blank. Murat? What's going on, Murat? Murat, I'm calling Ercan right now, we're going to the hospital right now. -Where is the nearest hospital here? -There is a clinic nearby. Ercan, bring the car quickly, I'm taking Murat out. -Don't worry about that. -Ercan, bring the car! Please follow the light. Do you see the light? I really don't see anything, Doctor. Can't you see this light? There seems to be a slight glow. Came. Gone. Came. Gone. Coming. Gone. -Oh Murat, oh! -Understood. There is no neurological finding. It may be poisoning. There may be nerve palsy due to a toxic substance. Did you eat anything? Like that, something different? Here we ate mushrooms, and then we ate that Cone paste. I told you, Murat, not to eat these. Was yours red with white spots like this? Maybe it was something like that. Yes, it was something like that. That's the dangerous kind. Oh, they poisoned! They poisoned my chalky eyes, they poisoned me. without pity. What if this man's left eye is 20 million dollars and his right eye is 30 million dollars. But he was poisoned. They poisoned it. No, darling, it's fine. But of course we were afraid. Uff! It was half past eight. No more videos, nothing. We shivered, yes. I'm going to talk to this guy's meningitis and I'm going to make him shoot this video. No, my love, don't worry. Murat is fine, everything is fine. -Shall we hang up? I will talk something. -I'll call you later, okay? I'll call later. Madam, I'm interrupting you with honey, it's half past eight o'clock, there was this video of ours that Murat Bey will share, Come on, share this now. He said eight o'clock, he said prime time, they all ran away. Let him post this before he runs away and let's make a mess. Let's come with a bang, huh. My brother is in the hospital, he is blind, do you realize? I hope it will fix. It's ours, not that video, please post it. Come on. Go talk to him and he's still holding the hand, take your hand like this, hit the phone like this and press the post. Come on, I love your eyes. damn! The man went blind, what post are you still talking about? Do you post this video or not? I don't. I do not share. -You don't share? -I don't share. Shame on you! Shame on you. Shame on artists like you. We took you, we fed you, we drank you. You also locked the account to us. We ate and drank what? Are you kidding me? At least you weren't going to share the video, why did you lock the account to us? Isn't it shameful? We have three cents of money, we are peasants. Look, I'm going crazy now! Get out of my sight, I don't want to deal with you anymore. Oh, look, don't let Murat stand up until tomorrow, what am I going to do with you, you'll see then. Disgraceful bastards! Nasty bastards! -Don't raise your voice! -Ill mannered! Nasty bastard! We pay for the banderol on every tape. On every tape. We've lifted you up with our tax. Come here. I will go inside. He doesn't see it anyway, if the phone is around, I'll take it, I'll post it. We're going to cut our own belt ourselves, you understand? Get on the erket. Ok bro. Who did come? Aisha? Who is there? Aisha? I also started to hear voices from the unknown. [whispers] What is this? It says facial recognition. It doesn't recognize my face. Are we going to make this face read now? What is this blackout? No, it didn't. damn! [clicks tongue] It didn't happen. damn! Something passes before my eyes, a shadow passes by. I will go crazy. damn! damn! damn! No, it doesn't. What a face, it feels like, the phone doesn't read. Murat, fuck that mushroom you ate, Murat. damn! Opened. Bye-bye, prime time. damn! Who is there? Look, don't get on my nerves in this hospital. Nurullah, I picked up the phone. How are we going to share it now? I don't know bro. Is that Murat's phone? -Brother, the girl came. -I saw, I saw the girl. What are you doing? Well, we're not doing anything. The phone rang bitterly. When there was no minister, the boy was blind or he always looked for the other side with his hand, so I entered and opened it. What are you talking about bro? Give me that phone. You're not going anywhere from here now. Because I'm calling the police! -Why? Why are you calling the police? -For stealing. -We? -Yes. Repent, shame on you. I'm sorry. Call, call. Call, call the police. -I'm looking, I'm looking. -Search. The police will not come. -Why? -This is the Gendarmerie zone. my god! I'm calling, you stop. Then call telecom, connect fiber. Okay? You stop, don't go anywhere. I'm looking, look. Then call the coast guard, come by land zodiac. Okay? Look, I called. -Wow, manager like you. Shame on you. -Oh my God! Yes friends. We will jointly stop the construction of Çökelek Holding here. We have not been completely successful in anything we have done so far. That's why I'm launching a full-time mobilization. Are you in? -We're here bro! -Very nice. Büşra and Kemal. You will manage the social media foot. We will establish a troll army as many villagers as there are who can hold a phone. We will constantly pump videos about what is done here, understood? We will raise awareness, friends. Okay? - All right, brother. -We have that job, don't worry. -Nurullah. -Here you go. You'll get a melee trucker with you. You will give physical training to the villagers. Brother, Wing Chun is my business, we'll handle it. Very nice. The rest of the truckers and me. Guys, we'll be on the front line.

Brother, according to the intelligence I got, foreign investors will come to see the construction tomorrow. They would tour the field. So, you understand, the situation is very serious. Look, you. So it invites foreign investors to the construction. The jackal will find money and speed up the construction. Guys, then I say to these incoming investors, let's have a nice Black Warehouse welcome ceremony. Say what? Let's show Turkish hospitality, Mr. Recep. I've hurt their heads all over, chief. No, there is no such thing as mouth-nose-breaking. We're just going to open the Black Warehouse horror package for them. We're going to make a nice horror arrangement. Let them be afraid that they will run away with their heels. Guys, this is just welcoming. [they laugh] Dear friend, here is our sample villa that we talked about in the project. [English] This is our sample villa. -Impressive design, isn't it? -Uh huh. [Turkish] He has a very impressive design, he says. Beautiful. So let's move on to the woods to talk about the rest of the project. Here you go. [English] Sure, let's go and see, yes, yes. Please Michael, look! A very nice place. -It's a beautiful place, isn't it? -Wonderful! But trees are very frequent. So, you're going to have to cut down some of these trees to build a vacation resort here. How do you intend to solve this problem? [Turkish] Many trees. [English] Don't panic, we'll cut it off in a crack. We start three days. Hmm, three days huh? You're too fast! But you know, in the USA cutting trees is a big deal, the laws are very strict. Do you expect any problems during this operation? About the villagers or the media? [Turkish] We Turks have a very famous saying; we'll handle it! -[English] Don't worry, it's all set. -Perfect. [Turkish] Don't worry, that's the easiest part anyway. These are peasants. These are ignorant. If they take two cents of money, they will sell their field, land, house, bark. They're already fed up here. They are the simplest. You don't need to worry about the media either. We already have them all. They can't make headlines without asking us. We feed them all well. We do all the work very easily. [English] Project fifty villas. But we will build one hundred and fifty villas! -How? -Wonderful. -Hocus pocus. -Hocus pocus. -[Turkish] Wow, wow, wow, wow. -Aha! Wow mom. Wow mom. Wow mom. Who do I see? -[English] Who is this? - He's a crazy peasant. Big businessman Erdem Çökelek and his saz friends, huh? What are you doing here? Are they American, huh? How about you guys? What do you nine here? What your near, huh? [English] What is he saying, I don't understand? It's ridiculous. [Turkish] My son does not understand that these are in English. I say what are you doing, he doesn't answer. Shouldn't these be outsourced like you? Did you come again troublemaker? Look at me, I'll bury you in the middle of this construction. Did you understand me? You scared us, you took our minds. I'll take your mind, open your brain, put it on a plate. I will throw onion, garlic, chili pepper and sumac on it. Plug, plug, plug, plug! I will cut cold cuts and serve, Izmir style. You wait longer. Go go! You've been talking here all along. You say hocus pocus, huh? We listened to the subject of trees, villas, etc. I just wanted to give you a hocus pocus. Look, watch now. [English] Look at my hands. [English] Look at my hands. Take a good look at my hands. Look, look, look. Do you see? Look, look, look. Look what's going on. Ah what is this? Look, he made the same move again. Look good. Ha! -Aha! -Oh! -Yeah. -Where did these come from, son? -I don't know, sir. -What happened? You were astonished. You have a mind. One of your eyes popped out. Uh, Michael? Jonathan? How beautiful, isn't it? Cut the trees here as you wish. Oh what a homeland. What a wonderful world, right? They are coming to our country, take it from there, give it to me. Given rose, taken rose. Isn't that what it's called? Given rose, taken rose, huh? Is it that easy? [English] Who are they? Take my rose, give my rose, what does that mean? [Turkish] My son, take them away. fuck off. We have no business with you. fuck off. Do not. Don't go somewhere... Where are you going son! Peace, come here. Let's give this dog a ride first. -Come, let's take you around. -Look at me, let my uncle know! - Inform the gendarmerie! Save me! - All right, son. Let's fly, let's fly. He flew, he flew. He flew, he flew. He flew, he flew. Let me go! What kind of people are you? Let me go. Leave. Leave. Download me. Download me. Let's get that jacket so nothing happens. It looks expensive. Why are you taking my jacket? Let me go. -Calm down, calm down. -Leave it. Let's tie hands. -He's also shamelessly rude. -Let's tie hands. You know, I'm going to tell my uncle, he'll kill you. -Calm down, my dude. -You will crawl in jail. -Did you understand me? -Turn it over! -Leave it. Ah! -Come on! -That's it. Let's see. -Do not! Look, my hair will break. -A. Two. Three. -Do not! Do not! They are rude. Bastards. And you're laughing. What kind of person are you? By Allah, it was exactly as his uncle said. Fifteen years made a difference, huh? My uncle will make you crawl in jail, you will see this. Let's do what you do! Nasty bastards. Well come on then, stay well. Take care, see you tomorrow. Let's run, guys. See you later. Do not go! Where are you? Don't leave me here. Animals eat me here. Help! I'm done! -So you complained about us, huh? -Of course I will. who are you? who are you? Who are you? I will show you who I am. It's almost time, wait. Then let us show you something. Give me son. -Let's see. Here, burn it from here. -[English] -[Turkish] Damn this is me! -Hop! Don't touch son, just watch. [English] We start three days. The project is fifty villas. But we… [Turkish] Bastards. You saved everything. Dishonest bastards! We found a bastard like you, shall we not record it son? Come on, complain now. please be. Come on. The commander has arrived. The commander has arrived. - Mr. Erdem, get well soon. -Thanks. Now, friends have taken their statements. So I called you to take your statement. Are you complaining? E, now, sir. Of course, while you were away, we had a little talk with friends here, and they already apologized to me on apology. Who apologized? Repentance, no, none of us apologized. Sir, we stand behind our action. If this happens again, we will take it again and throw it in the mud. E, sir, now you know, we are neighbors. So we're going to look each other in the face, right? After this moment, I think we should not prolong this case at all. I'm not a complainer. Mr. Erdem, there is a case of assault. Are you sure? Sir, I'm very sorry. It's not assault, it's bullying. No sir, no. OK, I'm sure. I'm not complaining about them. -Hello good day. -Have a nice day. I came as soon as I got the news. I am their lawyer, Büşra Altın. What is the matter, what happened? What is the complaint? No complaints, lawyer lady. You can get friends. Here you go. Hmm. OK, fine. Here you go guys. Good evening, commander. Be smart, let me see. -Have a nice day. -Have a nice day. Here are the peasant youth, sir. They think they are having fun. I'm leaving here for two days, look what happened. I'm collecting you guys from the corners of the police station. If you hadn't come, they would have left us anyway, Büşra. We have such a video that we blackmailed Erdem with this video. -We tied your mouth. -What video is that? Give me one. The video where Erdem talks about all the filth of Çökelek Holding. Dumped idiot while hanging around with investors. …but we'll make it 150 villas. Three days, it starts! We cannot use this video. This is garbage. How is it garbage? The man is officially revealing it here. Take it, hold it by your ear, throw it in. You took this video in secret. No, this is unusable. Of course we did it undercover. How else would we shoot? Dear Recep, I guess I can't explain myself to you. There is such a thing as KVKK. This is crime. No prosecutor would accept that. I cannot use it. I can't use it as evidence. How is this justice? How is this law? What is KVK? Is that possible? The man is frankly confessing here. The man is confessing his guilt here. Recep, will you calm down for a second? Such law is not justice. Right, law, justice! It's not like that, it should sink to the ground. Take this, hold it, give it to the court. That's not how things work. But I have an idea. Look, we can't use that as evidence. But… -But? -But… But? I don't understand anything, you keep making eyebrows, Büşra. Uff. All right, I'm telling you. We can leak this video to the internet. I'm not saying anything more. He's right. I solve this with VPN. I'll even upload it right now. Take it son, upload it now. Upload now, but don't let us lose track of you, huh. You guys, upload these and let this video hit all news sites… Abov! How will these people break up? They will see the inside of the whole precipitate. People who will spit in their faces. It will be a fire place. We're going to make a fuss, we're going to rattle. -What's going to happen? -It will be very nice. -There is only one very serious incident, Büşra. -What is it? If you've noticed in the video, Erdem was saying we'll be here in three days. Three days. They can come in at any time. So from now on we will keep watch in the forest with the Black Barn. Seagull mustache. Go get some stuff, meet me at the forest entrance. We'll be on watch with you tonight. -Thank you, chief. -Come on, stay well. [owl sings] Do you hear, Fatih? I hear it, chief. The gray owl howls. [owl sings] According to a belief, one of the darkest nights in the world, which is it, if a grizzly owl howls three times... [owl sings] …an orphan calf's heart is broken. Do you look at the mana? Very beautiful chief. [Wolf howl] At the moment, only the wolves are standing, Fatih. Coyotes, dogs, everybody sleeps. Your brother is tired. I will rest now. I'll have a little look at the ganyan tomorrow, and then I'll go to bed. Take care of yourself. Good evening, chief. Are they sleeping? What can I say, give them a nudge? -Am I really poking? -I think we should wake him up. I guess nothing will happen, right? Shst. Hello. Get up. Hey! Shst. He's waking up. my mother! what's going on? Stop bro. We are not malicious people. Who are you son, daughter? Who are you girl? Well, we are a team, we came to support you. -What support did you come to? -To Yutan Village. Did you come here to support? Yes, we are also not alone. We all came together. Brother, the video has already started working. Exactly bro. We've seen the video. It was TT. What are you saying? This is excellent news. - Get up, let's look at these. -Let's see, chief. Get off girls. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. Would you look at this view, seagull mustache? I want to cry bro. I want to cry bro! ♪ For the bird, for the tree They came for the forest ♪ ♪ For the bird, for the tree They came for the forest ♪ ♪ We were one, look, we became a thousand For a span of land ♪ ♪ We were one, look, we became a thousand For a span of land ♪ Uncle!

What is it that we took from you? Uncle, I am a victim of fate. You see. Officially installed. I was left in the middle of a conspiracy. What assembly? What blackmail? Is there a child in front of you, huh? Estağfurullah uncle, what does that mean? You talk about it publicly because you're an idiot, because you're an empty talker.

What extra? By extra I mean commission. Either I handed over the common areas. And you were going to give me double commission. That was said. Initiation commission. Impolite bastard. We're giving you food every day here. What a worthless person you are. Shameless. Don't you have any pain? Mr. Enver, you are speaking slowly alone. I solved this. If it weren't for me, Recep and the lawyer woman would be making you horny. Get out, you naughty bastard. Get out, don't get me in trouble. Come on. Get out. You dishonest pimp. Fuck off! Wow. So that's it. Thank you until you see your work, then ya Allah. I have two words for you, Enver. You have wronged the most wrong person here. Asım Civan will not forgive the one who wronged Asım Civan. I'll bring a wick from your nose. Shame on you. Get out. Get out! But I will write your name on the mountains, Enver! -You bastard pimp! -Do not worry, I will bring wick wick in your nose. Ah, I'm writing. I'll bring a wick. Fuck! Yes, dear Yutan Village resisters. You have come this far with us to protect this village and these forests. Thank you, exist. [in unison] Bravo!

Oh look who's coming from there. Junior Çökelek. [in unison] Whoops! [on megaphone] I'm calling out to the invaders here. It's a crime you committed. This is private property. You can't just come by waving your arms, set up a tent and camp. [in unison] Whoops! Hoot! Hoot! I give you 24 hours.

While we are here, no one can flatten these forests or this village. We will defend this place with our lives, God willing. [in unison] Bravo. Hop! Shoo! No, who are you looking at? Well, I'm sorry, lawyer lady, the door was open, so I came all of a sudden. -I brought good news. -Here, tell me. What, what happened? I came here to make a friendly speech. Don't you? We had a small argument with Enver, but he ended my employment contract. Oh, woe, woe. I'm so sorry, look at this now. I couldn't lift a little, I couldn't eat it. I was spoken badly to my face a little. I gathered my money. I bought my personal items. But I bought a little too much. Forehead. See your good. Does it contain company information now? Peh. What is not? There are all. And you give it to me. I have a life philosophy. Is that so, what is it? Enemy of my enemy is my friend. They got the wrong guy. Well, excuse me. man. I hope you are not lying. Yes friends. Tomorrow when they come here, they won't find us here. At midnight, we will clear the forest in the morning. They'll think we're gone. So are we really going? [in unison] No! - Shall we leave the forest to them? -[in unison] No! We will retreat into the forest, friends. We will face them with the crescent tactic. Everyone will have a place. Friends, the name of this forest is the forests of Yutan. And I hope these forests will swallow Çökelek Holding tomorrow. - May our Gaza be blessed! -Blessed! "…shut up. Threaten if necessary." Wow. Whoa! All of these will be accounted for. What is that? Useless. Stop. [clicks his tongue] Did you do that too? What? What? Now I'm done with you son. Wow idiots. Can something like this be mailed? They are idiots. I will burn you from here, from here. -This is the construction site. -I understand, chief. It has two entrances. here. here. Generally, we harass Erdem from here. They will make two exits. From here they will come out into the forest and down. We will be scattered in the forest. Spraying will be done from right, left and middle. They won't be able to see us here. We will hide in the forest. -You got it, right? -I understand, chief. What they spray from here will also come out, and what they spray from here will also come out. Everyone will swarm here. The incoming prey will fall into our lap. -Do you understand? -I understand, chief. -You got shit! -I understand. [Wolf howl] Ah! God damn it. how do i sleep How did I do such a thing?
