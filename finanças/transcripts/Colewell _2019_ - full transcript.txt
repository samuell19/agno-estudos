[Nora] We met this truck driver named Leroy outside of Baltimore. He told me that looking back, doesn't matter how old you are, life always feels the same length, like both forever and not very long. [Imitating cackling] [imitating cackling] Okay. Here you go. Here you go. [Heavy thud] [door closing] Morning. - What you got? - Circulars. - Circulars. - Want to help bringing them in? - You think I'm frail. - They're heavy. [Chuckles] I got a couple of Rhode Island Reds but no Rosie. She hasn't been laying much, huh? No, I put in a couple new birds and she's outta sorts. - You pissed her off, Nora. - Yeah, she likes her routine. Good morning. Right on time, Pete. [Woman] I brought you some soup. So we didn't make it past second day but we had fun time. - But you made it. - Yeah. That's what counts I think when you do anything. Middle of the forest it dumped, it's like an acre of boulders. It's really amazing to see for the first light for few minutes. - And then they'll take it back out after. - It just goes-- it'll stay in. I'm not changing the architectural shape of the building. I'm only putting something on to it. I can't change a wall, I can't change this, I can't change that. - But it'll stay there? - It'll stay there. I helped her put blocks together and then I helped finish my own because she died when she was on her second heart operation. And she died in '61. - Just these two, thanks Nora. - Okay. I got called for jury duty today, told them I know a fancy lawyer. [Man] I bet he's lousy company. How are you doing Stew? Okay Nora. Just stamps for these, please. [Nora] Okay. [Nora] You making any toys for this weekend? Oh yeah, got a new one going on now, I'm making pirate ships. Oh, okay. - Do you know a pirate's favorite letter-- the alphabet is? - I don't. - R. - Arrr. Yeah, that's 1.41. Okay. - Here you go. - Thank you. Okay. It was loud. It was like the fire alarm was going off and then kind of as quickly as it had come on, it stopped and I thought well that was strange. I got back into bed and it happened again about five minutes later. - That would freak me out. - I opened some doors, looked around, - I don't know there was-- - [girl] I got to get down to the bus. - Okay. - See you later. And 15 books are forever stamps, six first-class rolls, and a box of priority tape. Yeah. No, six. Yeah. 18311. Okay. Great. Bye. Hey hon, it's Nora. I've got a box for you here, I didn't want to leave it out so I thought I'd put it in the safe. Door will be open till 8:00. [Hens clucking] Hi, honey. Hey. Hey. Are you going to winterize the mower? Yeah, I think I'm going to cut the grass one more time. I wouldn't leave it out there though. Come spring you'll be sorry. - Okay. - All right. You're always worrying about something. Hey. I received this letter. I'm Bob Susskind and this is my associate Al Catarro. [Nora] You should have called. Yes. We've been dealing with several complex issues throughout the region. You're from Pendell? Colewell. 18311. [Bob] Eleanor Pancowski? Nora. Ms. Pancowski, decisions are being made outside this office with the good of our customers in mind. Can someone tell me what those decisions are, exactly? [Bob] Well, I do think it was clear in this letter. Well, it's not clear in the letter because the letter, it sounds like you're closing my office and terminating my position. - That's not exactly-- - We're not closing any offices. The letter made it sound like-- The letter says that we won't renew your contract once it expires this month, but that service will be uninterrupted for customers. They will be serviced by the Park Grove office. [Bob] And while your contract is not going to be renewed, there are other similar jobs that you can apply for. There's one in Delaney in fact that would get you back to work the following Monday. You want me to move to Delaney? Or you can pick up a few hours at Park Grove if you'd like I'm sure. Part time for less pay. This is an emotional time but I want to be clear. Any personal grievances regarding this transition must be kept private. [Bob] It's for your own benefit. As an employee of this institution, it's imperative that you keep your own personal opinions to yourself. It's just better that way. That way we can roll out information as we see fit. And you know, don't rule out Delaney. It's a kind of town-- there's family and kids, a nice movie theater, a couple restaurants. A lot of amenities for an older person. [Knocking on door] [Pete] Nora. [Pete] Nora? Where do I find a mailbox like that for at home? I'd like to know how we're supposed to get to Park Grove. And I'm concerned about the older people. They really rely on this place. [Woman] I'll contact a state representative, state senator and the district manager and find out what's going on. [Man] I'm trying to remember what Noxen tried. [Woman] What about Nora? [Man] I'll spend tonight looking at similar cases to figure out what motions they filed. It's going to take me a little while but there are avenues to fight this. [Woman] That's right. Return it all to sender. I was getting worried about you. You're always worrying. I got coffee but I'll take the eggs. Did you leave the stock shipment for me? What are you waiting on? Oh, there's just a few things I'm short on. There's this new guy Terry Terrence or something taking the orders but-- I don't get into calling them. Take a look at those. Woah. Good on you, Rosie! Yep, she's settling in. I heard about your office. Yeah. How are you holding up? I'm not supposed to talk about it. Says who? Regional team. If I want to be transferred, I have to play nice. They got you a spot lined up? Delaney. How are you going to get to Delaney? I guess you'll be driving me. Look, if they're offering you a steady thing in Delaney, maybe keep quiet during all this and take the job. Or maybe you retire. I don't know. Yeah. They think I'm old and I don't have any fight left in me. But I'm not going anywhere and I'm sure as hell not taking a bus to Delaney every morning. You weren't the only notice. I delivered one to Junedale. I heard Mahoning Lake got a letter. My sister said there's a town hall about their office in Slate Mill. They're all closing? Yeah. Some closing. Some getting evaluated. I know an attorney in Colewell, Gray. He says we have legal recourse. Maybe so, but I wouldn't go sticking your neck out. It's a lot of people fighting for a job, Nora, in Delaney or anywhere else. [People chattering] Do you know I have four chickens? Well, I have four parakeets and four dogs-- - Oh really? - Twelve dogs. - Do they all have names? - Yes. Do you know what their names are? Yes I know. --With the biscuits. I make the chicken in, you know, like, cream, peas and carrots in it and then they eat it all with the biscuit. That's for Sunday dinner. [Man] Hey Nora. Hey. How's Diana? Where is she these days? Well, she last week she was in Amsterdam. Right now she's in Berlin. [Nora] Berlin? Oh no. Belgium. Her gap year. [Nora] I had a couple of those. [Man] Yeah? [Nora] Hitchhiked around a bit, always wanted to go to Europe. Was there quite a few years and he said "Stick with me, kid, and I'll give you the business." Well, he did but the business had a lot of debt and I closed it down, couldn't keep it open. [Woman] I guess I'll shove off now. Okay. Are you sure you don't want to borrow a coat? It's cold outside. No, I think I'll do the fashion thing and just go without, okay? All right. Take care. Go home safe. [Door opening] [Nora] Hey. Where you off to next? I don't know. Rosemary and I had been hitching down the coast. We went to Florida, Carolinas, Atlanta. Where is she? The guy she was seeing got out of the army and wanted to come along with us so. Drivers don't like picking up three people. And I just got to be-- she wasn't the same thing. I used to love to hitchhike. I liked going where no one knew me, where I was just undefined. How long have you lived here? My husband grew up here. He drove a truck for the quarry. I came to Colewell in 1968 and then we bought this house in 1970 in the spring. I can't imagine living in the same place and doing the same thing for all that time. Well, time goes faster when you get older. We met this truck driver named Leroy outside of Baltimore. He had a glass eye. He got sent home sick in high school, walked out into the archery class and caught an arrow in the eye. Lost the eye. Anyway, he told me the thing about getting older is looking back, it doesn't matter how old you are, life always feels the same length. Like both forever and not very long. He said a fraction of that also feels the same. Like, for me, thirteen years is half my life and it feels just like a certain amount of time. And for you, thirty-whatever years feels the same. Well, however it works, it's true. Are you afraid of retiring? I'm afraid of-- well, I just-- I don't want to be lonely. I don't think I get lonely. Well, wait until things slow down and then you'll find out. I wrote a terrible poem once. "As I walk along the highway, cemeteries wait, lined with tombstones that say things like, 'Jane Delone, my lovely wife, and mother of two, died at 65. But under moonlight, her soft emerald fingers push up through soft, black soil.' [Imitating clucking] Yeah. [Knocking on door] [Nora] Just one second. [People chattering] [man] --meeting with the postal service on Tuesday now. We're going to need town's people to speak at the microphone. [Woman] My landlord might be able to-- Hey Nora. Good morning, Gray. - Here. - Town hall. Well, this is a chance to engage, okay? - Monday okay? - Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Before sealing the appeal I made photocopies of the signatures of all the petition. They also submitted an application for suspension which would allow you to stay open until the appeal is heard. Thank you, Gray. I'll let you know how they respond. Yeah. [Nora] Yeah, I placed an order and I just want to check the status. I need 15 sheets of seasonal stamps, six rolls of first-class, a box of priority tape, a box of first-class books. Yeah. Okay. Well-- well, that doesn't make much sense because-- will you let me finish? Did you-- Shit. [Driver] Next stop: Delaney. [Man] --talking to people so much, you know. Yeah. Yeah. You got to do that. I don't know what they're coming in for. They try to make them feel good when they go in. - Private email, right? - Yes. - Two or three days. - Okay. Thanks. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Bye, bye. - Good morning. - [Nora] Morning. - How's your day so far? - Okay. Good. What can I do for you? I need 15 sheets of seasonal stamps. They're 9.20 a piece. Okay. And then I need six rolls of first class and I need a box of priority tape. I'll check the inventory. Starting your own office? Good evening. We're about to get started. If everyone could take your seats. Thank you all for coming out tonight and thank you to the members of the Postal Service who are here to hear our concerns. I care a lot about the Colwell community and I want to hear firsthand what the Postal Service has to say here. So first and foremost let's keep this respectful and Bob would you like to start us off? Sure. Well, thank you all for coming, it's quite a turnout. Obviously, Colewell is a very special place. I would like to first say that this is-- issue is not specific to Colewell, it's something that's happening all over the country and it's hard on all of us. Few details to get out of the way. If you are a customer who is opting for rural delivery, mail be coming right to your door. If you are resident who prefers to pick up their mail and are unable to travel to Park Grove, we will be installing cluster boxes in the parking lot adjacent to the current location. Uhm, well, with that, let's open this up for discussion. [Woman] I just had a question. How did you decide which ones-- which post offices to close? Did it had to do with population, did it had to do with-- [Bob] It's a lot of factors. It's money that's my in, it's personnel, infrastructure. Can you just think about this on a human level? Also Angie and I were just talking about this. This thing goes into play the way that you're talking about with for money and all these reasons, we're never going to see each other. When are we going to see each other? This is the heart of our community, where people go and congregate. [Bob] Well, I'm not sure it's the post office's job to build community. - [Woman] Oh, stop. - [Bob] It's the post office's job-- Excuse me. Gray Albright, lawyer for the town, representing these people. Now when Ben Franklin founded the post office, the original poster, his-- it was his decision, he made this clear that it was the community's decision whether they wanted a post office or not. And now under Richard Nixon it's become a semi private institution. Right. Right. Yeah I want to know why you've had this idea for months, we get a 30-day notice? - Yeah. - Yeah. Just so you know, we are managing 15,000 leases. I've seen these situations change their mind overnight. We felt no reason to get everyone concerned until we were certain that this was going to happen. You stop just before you start telling us how much money you're losing. I'll tell you how much money you're losing. You're losing four billion dollars a year since the year of 2000. Why do you think you're going to be able to turn us around now? You guys think you're the smartest people on the planet but if you were in a real industry, you'd be out on the street, you'd be fired long gone, simple as that because you just can't-- you can't-- you have a cap-- you have a captive audience. People need to use you and you can't even make a dime. You know, we've been here since 1895, we've been good and loyal customers, we have a right to get our mail in our town, not delivered, not-- [Bob] We're not shrugging our shoulders. [Man] I would like to know is are we going to get another meeting out of this? [Man] You've heard a lot of questions tonight, seen a lot of concern expressed. Do we get another meeting or not? [Bob] This will be the only meeting of this nature but if you'd like to write a letter-- - [people laughing] - [man] Mail it where? [Man] I got one more question for you guys, you know, on a personal level, what's going to happen to Nora after she loses her job? [Bob] I think that's a personal decision for your postmaster and-- Hey Nora, need a ride back? I let everybody down. This was a formality Nora. It wouldn't have changed nothing. Never... ...really wanted to move here and now I can't seem to leave. It's funny how you can feel close to people and explaining I don't even think I know how to have a conversation with somebody once I close that window. Life's-- Life's hard in that you lose people as you go in all kinds of ways. I'm in-- where am I, Hazleton. Yeah I thought I'd try heading up North for a little while. I didn't know if anyone was there, if you had a key or hit-- You sure? O h, that's great. Thank you. I appreciate it. Yeah, I think I just saw a ride so I'm going to-- okay. Thanks. [Woman] Hey, sorry, you heading North? Any chance I could get a ride? [Man] You okay with dogs? Yeah, I like dogs. All right then. How old were you when you first drove a truck? [Man] Are you a cop? [Man] I was 14. [Woman] Fourteen? [Man] Don't tell anybody. [Woman] I won't. You do construction? Quarry. The troops were allowed at 5 a.m. Every morning? Mh-hm. Been on the road long? About a year. You miss home? It's been a long time being afraid of things changing then I realized if I didn't leave, I never would. You live near family? [Man] The bed I sleep in now is about three-quarters of a mile from the house I grew up in. [Man] I guess you could say I am uneasy with change as well. I always connected change to my parents getting older. Don't you get over that? I guess so. Wake up in a different place every day. I don't really feel defined by anything. Anymore. I'm Andy. Ella. Nice to meet you, Ella. Miss to meet you too. [Andy] Here's Cooper. [Ella] I saw this boy. He's a sweetheart. Listen, before you go, I'll give you the number for the quarry. You ever stuck for a ride out here, just give a call. Thanks. And don't worry about change, time passes, you got a lot of life ahead of you. Hi. Come on in. All right. We have form 3107 here which is our application for immediate retirement and this one is form 991, which is the form we use for reassignment. I filled out all the pertinent information for Delaney, it's in here. All right. Here we go. Ms. Pancowski, I can't make the decision for you but they're both good options. Five more years? Ms. Pancowski, I-- Please, just give me five more years, we're doing okay financially. I won't lose you money. In five years I'll be 70, I can retire and you can relocate then. This isn't my call. I can work. I'm strong. I can work for five more years but I can't start over again, I can't. Delaney is a very nice town. Damn it. To hell with Delaney. I don't live in Delaney. You want to start your life over again? What are you going to do ten years from now when this happens to you? This is the best I can offer. I'm sorry. Hey, Charles. Yeah. I figured I owed you. It's hot chocolate. You didn't have to do that. I-- It's okay. You know, if I'm ever passing by this way maybe I'll stop by for some eggs, huh? All right. All right. I'll probably see you again, huh? Sure. Yeah.
