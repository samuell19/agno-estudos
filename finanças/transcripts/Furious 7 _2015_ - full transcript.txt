LONDON, ENGLAND They say if you want a glimpse of the future... Just look behind you. I used to think that was bollocks. Now I realize... you can't outrun the past. When we were kids... You'd start fights with the toughest bastards in the yard. But I was the one... who were to step in and finish them. Rest now, little brother. While I settle your one last score. Take care of my brother. Anything happens to him... I'll come back looking for you. Here. Hold this. FAST & FURIOUS 7. Come on, Dom, so where are you taking me? They say an open road helps you think... about where you've been... where you're going. So you don't remember any of this yet? It's not fair. You know I don't. So what is it exactly that you're trying to show me? That. Race Wars. We used to come here? "Come here"? We invented it. RACE WARS Keep it under 9000 RPMs. Kid's gonna fire his pistons after the first 200. You know that's not my style, I got to ride or die, right? How about you just ride on this one. Are you ready? I know you're ready! Go! Nice job! Hey! That's the girl I heard so much about. Where you been at, ghost girl? That's the girl... Ghost girl... Letty, what the hell? Damn, Dom! Your girl's still got that swing, homie. You never could take a punch. Right, right. Hey, man, I'm glad you're back, man. It's good to see you. Good to see you, Hector. Alright. We made it, Jack. - Yeah, we made it! - Yeah, we made it. I just gotta, find that door button. Buddy where's the door button at? Do you know? - Hey. - Hey. Yeah, of course. I'm new to this. Yeah, you don't seem like the minivan type. No, not exactly. Hey buddy you didn't give me a high-five? Wait, wait, wait. High-five! All right! Yeah, buddy. Appreciate it, thank you. Don't worry, you'll get used to this in no time. Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. First time I saw this... I thought it was kind of funny. I guess now, the joke's on me. What are you doing? What I should've done a long time ago. Stop! Look at it. It's the truth. That's the date that I lost my memory. That's the date that Letty died. And I was born. No. You never died. Do you know how hard it is for me when you look at me? And you see me through 15 years of memories? Every beautiful moment we've ever had. I see it in your eyes. I can't give that to you. I got nothing. You got me. And you've got only a piece of me. I have to find myself. For me. Goodbye, Dom. -DIPLOMATIC SECURITY SERVICE- LOS ANGELES DIVISION You're disappointed, aren't you? What are you talking about? The last arrest. It was too easy. Target didn't even run. Ah, it's okay. Gives me a chance to hit the iron. Also, lets me work on my stamping skills. You're a terrible liar. See you tomorrow, boss. - I'll see you then. - Don't stay too late. I'll stay as long as I want, woman. I knew you'd say that. Elena? What's this? It's the letter of recommendation you asked for. Just know I meant every word in there. Thanks, Hobbs. Thanks for everything. Come on, way too sentimental right now. Get home. Good night. Okay. Bye. Just one sec. You sure as hell ain't the IT guy so you better start talking... before I break that finger six different ways... and stick it straight right where the sun doesn't shine. Agent Hobbs, right? That's right. I'm also the last man on Earth whose computer you wanna be hacking into. You just earned yourself a dance with the devil, boy. You're under arrest. Like I said, I'm here for the team that crippled my brother. There ain't no goddamn team. It was just one man, and he's standing right in front of you. The lady was right. You are a terrible liar. Goddamn IT guys. Hobbs! On me! Elena! Hobbs? Hobbs! Alright buddy, we gotta go or we'll be late. Come on. Okay, uhh. What do you think? Parking brake slide right up to the school? Where's mommy? I don't know. She's up there. She's coming. Oh. Watch your head. Dom, you have a package out here. From Tokyo. Tokyo? What's Han trying, to convert me over to a turbo charger? You ready? There we go. Hey buddy, cars don't fly. Hey, cars don't fly. This one did, huh? Brian in a minivan. Things have changed. He's struggling, Dom. He doesn't want me to see it... but the white picket fence is like an anchor for him. I can tell. I tried to talk to him the other night. Do you know what he said? He doesn't miss the girls. He doesn't miss the cars. He misses the bullets. Let him settle in. Give him time. How does nine months sound? I'm having another baby. And you didn't tell him, did you? You gotta tell him. I don't want him to be disappointed with this life. With me. He will never be disappointed with you. You're the best thing that's ever happened to him. Thank you. Yeah? Dominic Toretto. You don't know me. You're about to. Private number Tokyo, Japan. Get down! Jack! Jack! Shattered his collarbone, fractured his leg in two places. He only regained consciousness this morning. First thing he said was, "Get me Dom". He's in there. You okay? I'm fine. He's waiting. Let's go. Got something for you. Your files. Thank you. You risk life and limb to save the free world... and what do they give you? Jell-O and a bad 70's TV show. Y'know, it's got its perks. Sponge baths ain't that bad. Dad! I'm sorry, baby. "Dad"? Honey, I want to introduce you to somebody. He's a, uhh... He's an old friend. Go on and say hello. Dominic Toretto, right? My dad said, he kicked your ass once. Who did this? You remember Owen Shaw? The one we tore half of London down trying to get. Well... This is his big, bad brother. Take a look at this. "Deckard Shaw" British Special Forces assassin. The kind of unique asset... that no government would ever admit to employing. Black Ops boys. Worse. They created a monster. They felt Shaw was a necessary evil until eventually... they decided he was unnecessary. The powers that be, felt that he knew just a little bit too much. The asset became a liability. So they sent in 20 elite operatives to retire him. And they missed. That was 6 years ago and Shaw's been a ghost ever since. Until now. How do I find him? The official answer is: you don't. He killed Han. Almost killed my family. He also tried to put me in a body bag, too. Which is why when I get out, I'm gonna put a hurt on him so bad... he's gonna wish his mother had kept her legs closed. But until then, my official answer to you... is stand down. Now you know I can't do that. I do know you, Dom. Which is why now I give you a brother to brother answer. You do whatever it is you gotta do. When you find that son of a bitch... Just do me one favor. What's that? Don't miss. MONTECRISTO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC Thank you so much for letting us stay, Mando. I hope it's not a problem. Listen, Dom needed a safe delivered to Rio in two days. That was a problem. Hosting his family in the Dominican Republic, that is vacation. Anyone messes with you here... they're messing with the entire country. You'll be safe. Yeah, they're here. I picked them up myself at the airport. Hold on. Your brother. Dom. Yeah, Mia, it's me. How's it going there? We're at Mando's. This place is like a fortress. You should see Brian. He's in full FBI mode. He built a surveillance hub in Mando's garage and everything. What about you? Did you find out who's after us? Looks like the sins of London have followed us home. How did Buster take the news? I can't tell him. If he knew about the baby, he'd stay here with us. And with all that's going on, you're gonna need him by your side. Just watch out for him. Keep him safe. And come home together. Tell Brian I'll see him in LA in two days. Where are you going? Tokyo. I'm bringing Han home. Authorities are still trying to determine... the motive behind this daring attack here at the office... of the US Diplomatic Security Service in downtown Los Angeles... less than 36 hours ago. Facts are still coming in... but what is known is the suspect entered the building's 4th floor... Hey. - You okay? - Yeah. This guy's just, relentless. That's why Dom needs you. You two need to find this guy and you need to stop him... before he does any more damage to our family. I just... I've screwed up so many things. I couldn't live with myself if I screwed this up, too. You won't. I believe in you. I believe in us. That's all that matters. I love you, Brian. Love you, baby. Just promise me. After this, we're done. No more jobs, no more enemies. Come back to us. I won't let you down, Mia. I know. TOKYO, JAPAN Hey yo, Sean! Hey, check this out, man. This dude over here wanna race the new DK. Not tonight, Twinkie. He said he knew Han. Han said you was fast, but not that damn fast. Who said American muscle can't drift? Han mentioned he left his enemies in his rear view. He never talked about it much. Always playing it close to the vest. We found a couple of things by the crash. Wasn't much left. Gisele. Yeah. There's one more thing. I found this. Must've meant something to him. When you find the guy that killed Han... What are you going to do? Words ain't even been invented yet. They say to live in the hearts of those we leave behind... is not to die. But he put you in his grave. So now I'll do the same to him. I can't do no more funerals. First, Han... Now Hobbs is laid out, of all people. We're being hunted. You know he's out there somewhere watching, right? I hope so. That means he's close. Just promise me, Brian. No more funerals. Just one more. His. You never should've messed with a man's family. I told your brother the same thing. Reinforced your chassis. Just like going into the ring with weighted gloves. Your mistake. I'm not here to play games. See, you and me... We're from different worlds. Trust me, I've seen a lot meaner streets than the ones you're used to. Stick around. It's gonna get a lot meaner. You think this was gonna be a street fight? On the ground! Now! Drop him or I will drop you! Woah, woah! Easy, guys. We're on the same team here. Mr. Toretto... I'm here on the recommendation... of a, mutual friend of ours. - Mr. Hobbs? - Who the hell are you? Me? I'm just a guy. I'm, Mr. Nobody. That's a big entrance for a nobody. And the guy who put our mutual friend in the hospital... you just let him get away. I think I might've just saved your ass there, Dom. Listen, you think you can let go of my guy there? He's beginning to turn a little blue. I appreciate that. Here they come. Listen, Dom. There's a war going on between shadows and ghosts like me. You and your team unwittingly walked into the middle of it in London... and it appears it's now followed you home. It's up to you. I'm gonna have a beer. You're welcome to join me. By the way, I can get you Deckard Shaw. BASE OF OPERATIONS EL SEGUNDO, CALIFORNIA Belgian ale. Man, those monks got it right. I don't know about the whole celibacy thing, but when it comes to beer... Would you like one? I'm more of a Corona man myself. Your files, not only detailed... It's, extremely entertaining. Look, Shaw's power is that he's a shadow. He's really good at getting in and out of places... without being seen and leaving nothing but a body count in his wake. He's a legitimate English badass. But to be honest with you Dom, I don't give two shits about Deckard Shaw. It's you I want. Because you and I can help each other get what we both need. I'm listening. Just recently, a private military company... led by a wanted terrorist named Mose Jakande... kidnapped a hacker known only by the name "Ramsey". Lady Liberty's got her panties in a bunch over this but rightfully so... because this Ramsey has created something interesting. - Bring it up. - Yes, sir. Say hello... To God's Eye. Now this little bastard hacks into anything that's on a digital network. That means every cellphone, satellite, ATM machine, and computer, simultaneously. If it's got a microphone or a lens, God's Eye can use it to find you. So you invited me here to show me a tracking device. On steroids. Lots of them. Let me put it to you this way. It took us nearly a decade to find Osama bin Laden. With this, we could locate him anywhere on the planet in a couple of hours. Now that's a serious piece of machinery... that could be catastrophic in the wrong hands. But for some very nauseating, political reasons... any rescue plans involving any US government forces or entity... has been strictly ruled out. And that's why I need you. But why do I need you? I mean I could go back outside, enjoy the rest of the Coronas... let Shaw come to me. You could do that. How's that working out for you so far? You got one friend in the ground, another one in the hospital... and then of course there's that little issue of the bomb... that destroyed your home. Shaw lives in a world that doesn't play by your rules. Like it or not... you live in that world now, too. You wanna know how to kill a shadow? You just shine a little light on it. If you get the God's Eye for me... I've already got authori
