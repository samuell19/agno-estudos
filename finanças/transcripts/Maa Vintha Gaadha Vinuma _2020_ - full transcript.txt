It's only till Tuesday, I swear! I'm totally free after that. Hey! You know I love you, right? You know that. When? Wait. I'll call you back. What's up, bro? Hmm? Talking to your girlfriend? Yeah. You screwed my life! -Bro! Bro! Bro! That camera's worth 6 lakhs. Bro, please! Please, bro. ['Raavoi Chandamama' song playing] 'The person you're calling is not answering.' 'Please call again later.' Why isn't she answering her phone? Man, let's get out of here. It's so cheap, waiting outside a ladies hostel like this. You can leave if you want to. I don't need you here. I can handle it. Leave! Fuck! Remember how I smacked him in the 9th grade for tearing my bag? Tell him that's going to repeat again now. Hello, boss. I said you can leave. You're a respected person in the society. Can't keep you waiting. Get down. It's my car. You act like it's a BMW. Asshole! Don't call me in the morning again. -Like I will. Get lost, man. I've had enough of your drama. -Yeah, right. Get out of here! Friendship, my ass! -Take your hand off my car. What are you looking at, huh? What? This road is public property. What are you staring for? What are you looking at, huh? I'm looking at you. Hit me. I dare you. Come at me, man. Don't show off. Get out of here. -I dare you. Come on. Try and touch me, dude. Come on. -Get lost. I'm not interested. I said I've had enough! -Where do you live? Give me your location. Don't be scared. -It's the wee hours. Get out. What business would I have here in the morning? Did you just hit me? I'm keeping calm because it's a ladies hostel. ['Raavoi Chandamama' song playing] I didn't commit the theft, sir. -Then who did? Chintala Basti Arjun did, sir. Then why did you get caught? Well, he got away, sir. I tried to run and tripped on the chips stand. So you're innocent? -Yes, sir. It's on him completely. -Yes, sir. He fooled you and escaped, is it? You should catch him, sir. -I don't plan to. How come, sir? What was that movie which featured Victory Venkatesh as a cop? Gharshana, sir. -Right. In reality, this profession is not as savage. It's a chill job. We log in at 10 and have a cup of tea. Attend a few phone calls. Log out in the evening, have another cup of tea and head home. Crime rate has dropped noticeably since KCR's rule. He doesn't spare anyone. So you're going to let me go now? -In your dreams. You should clean the toilets at our station for 2 days. Toilets? Seriously? -What did you expect? A grand convoy escorting you to Central Jail? Idiot! Where are you originally from? -Visakhapatnam, sir. Now I get it. Smart ass! What's the case, sir? Petty cases are a pain. Pavan, lock them in. Take them! -Sir, we can only fit in one person. Sir, hear me out. -No, sir. Hear me out. What do you have to say? You tripped on the chips stand, silly. This guy tried to sneak into a ladies hostel. Let's hear his story. Pavan! -Sir, that's not fair. But I didn't do anything. -Get him out of my sight, Pavan. Tell me. Actually, my girlfriend stays in that ladies hostel. We had a fight. She broke up with me, so... -Hold on! Do you have somewhere else to be? Why are you rushing? What did you say your name was? -Siddhu, sir. Siddhu, my ass! Give me your full name. You know how every guy named Siddharth... is automatically addressed as Siddhu. For example, in the movie Khushi... -Ah, I get it. Where do you stay? -Padmarao Nagar, sir. Alright. So you're from Chilakalaguda. What do your parents do? 'My mom's a homemaker, sir.' 'She cooks amazingly well.' 'My dad's name is Chaitanya.' 'He owns an ad agency.' Okay, cool. Now tell me about the girl. 'There's someone important in my life other than my parents.' 'And her name is Vineetha Venugopal.' 'I tried impressing her for 2 and a half years.' 'Spent 6 months wondering how to propose.' 'Everyone has told me that eating okra makes you a Maths genius.' 'But when you propose a girl...' 'What follows is a long pause.' 'Nobody tells you that.' Vineetha... Hi. I love you. This guy... Good morning, sir. 'She didn't say yes or no.' 'There's one reply that's more terrifying.' In the classroom... In front of everyone... You're daring, man. -Sir... Sir... Now that I'm in the final year of Engineering, I dared to do it. But when I was in the first year... Baby... My family doesn't approve. I'm really sorry. -Alright. Let's elope then. What say? I don't... have any money, baby. It's okay. We'll sell my jewelry. Okay. You sold her jewelry and got married. Now you're on your honeymoon. Excuse me! I wasn't talking to you. -But I was. Hello! -Hey! Is this how you talk to your senior? You don't have the basic etiquette of speaking to a girl. Guys, teach her to respect her seniors. Do you have respect for girls? Huh? -I won't tolerate this. Worst kind of a guy you are! -You're a junior. Remember that. She'll complain. Take it easy. -Excuse me, sir. I'm not comfortable doing this. I'm sorry. Useless fellow! Ah, fuck! You like her? Get up, you! Stand there! First years aren't allowed to wear denims. Pull them down. Sir? Pull them down or I'll screw you! Don't even think of taking a break until we get back. Take care! Get started! -The horn on the bus goes... Beep-Beep-Beep. Beep-Beep-Beep. Bro, who was that girl? She's beautiful! How would I know, bro? It's my first day as well. But you're right. She's pretty. I think I'm going to go talk to her. Horn goes beep! Beep! Umm... Excuse me. Excuse me. -Yeah? Vineetha, I think this is the class. -Yeah. [radio playing] Getting the feels, huh? It was the wind. Focus. Bro, how do I look? There's something under your eye. -Where? Where? Right there. -Is it gone? You look fine. Just go. Sir... Sir... -What is this? You're first years, okay? What about you? Acting smart, huh? Didn't I ask you to cut your hair? -But it's a Tuesday, sir. Pass me that. Quickly. How many...? How many subjects are there in the first year? Including labs, 10 subjects, sir. -10 plus 1. There's this subject called M1. If you clear that, you're an Engineer. 'First year passed by.' 'In the second year, I grew my beard a little.' When you're a first year student... You fear the seniors, as they might rag you. When you're a 4th year student... You fear ruining things for yourself in the end. But when you're a 2nd year student... You're fearless. You don't have to fear anybody. You can walk straight through the college gate with swag. 'But...' 'When you have to look into a girl's eyes and say you love her...' 'You're bound to lose your shit.' 'I did too.' Vineetha... You know... Err... Umm... Vinod... Err... I think... I think I'm in love with you. You think? No. No. I know I'm in love with you. Vinod, you're a great guy and... a very nice friend. You have all the qualities of a perfect guy. But... You being a perfect guy... And you being perfect for me... They're two different things, right? So, give me some time. [lecturer teaching] 'You're the perfect guy.' 'But you're not perfect for me.' Whoa! Who does she think she is? Get up! Tell me about inverse Laplace and g transfer. Sir... Lap, what? Which subject am I teaching you, huh? You don't even know which lecture is going on. What are you coming to college for? To ogle at girls? You want love? Sir, I wasn't talking. It was these two. -Then three of you get out, please. Sir! But, sir... -I'm telling you, please get out. You failed thrice in M1. And your aim is to get placed in Google. All this relationship stuff is... It's nonsense, Vineetha. [lecturer continues teaching] What do I tell Vinod then? If he's serious about you, he'll only come back. Anyway... Do you really want to be in a relationship right now? I mean... Break-ups are so painful! If something goes wrong in the future, will you sit and sob? And also... Your priorities will change. You'll start ignoring everyone else. Tell me something. You're narrating the incidents you were a part of. Makes sense. But how do you know what happened in your absence? Later Vineetha told me what happened. -Oh! Kind of like that crime show. I'm sharing a love story and you call it a crime show? Didn't you ever do anything illegal? Hmm... If you put it that way... I've eased my way through a small issue. It was petty, I swear. Asshole! Okay, students. Campus interviews are starting next month. These exams are your last chance to clear any first year subjects. Or else, you wouldn't be eligible for campus interviews. Vineetha... Vineetha... Hi. Hi. Supplementary exam results are out. Oh. I'll check. I... checked. You failed. Oh, is it? Hey, chill! You passed. You got a 72 out of 100. You're shocked, right? I mean, you did answer only one question. Yeah. How do you know? -I do. Because the answer sheet that was sent to the University... It wasn't yours. I filled a different one. -What?! How's that possible? -It's possible. You just have to bribe the driver for 10K. Excuse me. Can you please be a little more clear? -Sorry. Sorry. I also bought out the the junior lecturer for 10K. Are you serious? -Relax! That's how I passed my exam. So, because you cheated... It's okay for me to cheat, huh? Why did you switch my answer sheet without my permission anyway? It was a 1st year subject. -So? If you fail, you can't apply for Google. -Oh, thank you. Now I'll carry the guilt of cheating in this subject, throughout my life. Come on. Fuck, I feel like I don't deserve this degree anymore. -Vineetha... Please! The Maths you learn now, no one's ever going to quiz you on it again. I mean, you've cleared every other subject. It's really stupid to believe that you don't deserve this degree because of this. What? -What? Shut up, Siddhu. It's wrong to switch my answer sheet. It's wrong to bribe the lecturer. And it's wrong to feel guilty for something I haven't done. And above all that... You're expecting a thank you from me. Now that's stupid. Thanks. But, no thanks. Dude... We've been friends for 7 years. Have you ever helped me pass my exams? We're satisfied with a qualifying score. But your girl... What does she expect? To become the Prime Minister of India? She wants to pass. But without feeling guilty. Also, she wants to keep her pride. If pride is her main concern... Ask her to study harder. Except for getting me free drinks on a ladies night at the club... Do you do anything for me at all? -Dude! I still have backlogs in M1. Even cheating doesn't get me through. Help me pass. Nikki... Should I go and apologize to her? What say? I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have switched your answer sheet. Not just that. This whole thing is wrong. -Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. My bad. Only one thing kept me from complaining. If I did... You'd be expelled. Yeah. Thanks. After all, you're not a bad guy. By the way... Congrats. I heard you got placed in Google. Sure. You did too, right? -Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Cool. I'll leave you guys to it. Bye. What's with the chemistry you both had at the end? Huh? That chemistry you both had at the end... I got placed in Google because he helped me clear the exam. So he's just rubbing it in my face. 'The first time I was going to propose, some senior stopped me.' 'The second time, Vinod was already having the same conversation.' 'This time, I won't let anybody steal my spotlight, sir.' 'Suppose Vineetha says yes and we have kids in the future...' 'I'd need an interesting proposal story to narrate to my kids.' Well, what was your girl's reply? You don't have kids soon after honeymoon, sir. It takes minimum 9 months. We should wait. -Oh, really? Sir, you're smoking Gold Flake Lights, right?-Yeah. But there's someone else in my story. He couldn't wait. -Who was he? The villain. -Damn it. There's a villain in your story?! Hi. This is Karthik Venugopal. Siddharth. -Vineetha's brother. I'm alumnus of this college. And now I'm marrying the Chairman's daughter. I know that you proposed Vineetha. It's cool. You see, as long as she doesn't have a problem... Everything is all good. It's fine, really. But when she starts feeling bothered... Anyway, I've got to go. Bye. If you could understand her, where's the fun in that? None of my ideas work out, dad. You mean helping her pass the exam... and getting the blind across the road? You should be honest, man. I proposed in the classroom. That's being honest, right? No. That's rushing things. Then she could've just said no. Come on! I get that she didn't say yes. But she didn't say no either. Boys! Your breakfast is ready. Dad! Help yourself. Mani... -Hmm? You're looking hot. I know. Umm... Excuse me. Sir? Can you please continue? -Yes, of course. Don't rush at all. First, she should get to know you. Take her out, but... Only as friends. Let her feel comfortable around you. Then propose again. And if she says yes then... The relationship will be solid. But, what if she says no then? Find someone else. -Come on! I tried flattering 8 girls. Your mom was the 9th. If she says no... You have to move on in life. Your life and your beer should always be C-H-I-L-L. Chill. It's going to work beautifully. Okay. Yeah. Hey! -Yeah? What's with the puppy face? Be confident. Be a man. Widen your chest. Done. Come on. Hi. It's Nikki's birthday tomorrow. Why don't you come? She won't. Her father will not approve. Father? Will you come if he approves? Hmm? Will you ask him? Yeah. Go ahead. Hello, sir. Hi. -What?! My name is Siddhu, sir. Vineetha's classmate. -Oh, hi. Sir, I need your permission to take Vineetha out. What do you mean? As in, it's my friend Nikki's birthday tomorrow. We're going in a group. Niharika is also tagging along. Oh. It's in a group. So I wanted to ask you... Uncle! You shouldn't be waiting in line at our college. It's okay. -No, it's very embarrassing. That's okay, dear. By the way, this is Siddhu. Apparently Vineetha's classmate. Oh, hi! So you're Siddhu. -I mean, yeah. Hi. -Hi. This is Meghana. Karthik's fiance. Oh! This is my college. -Okay. Hi. Hey, guys. Alright. You guys can go. I don't mind if Vineetha is willing to go. Oh. Great, uncle. Thanks. Uncle, we'll be late for our flight. Let's go? Yeah, sure. We'll leave. Best wishes. -Thank you, sir. See you. Airport is a long way from here. Vineetha... -What? Are you out of your mind? I was just kidding. What happened? Is she coming or not? Huh? "As the distance begins to fade..." "It feels like a miracle" "My smile only widens" "Not settling for less this time" "Let our story unfold beautifully" "Let me add my name to yours" "Let me discover your adorable side" "Those glances that we share from across the room" "They make time slow down and push you towards me" "Before you come close and throw a smile at me" "Why don't you read what's in my heart?" "Let me be your sweet symphony" "Let me be the fantasy in your eyes" "Let me fully absorb that this isn't a dream" "Let me live these moments one at a time" "As time slows down..." "It feels like a miracle" "My smile only widens" Okay, cool. I'll get going. See you guys. Have fun. But we have tickets booked for the 10:45 show. Yeah. Let's go from here. -Oh, we're going? I thought your evening would be packed. If that was the case, why would I book the tickets? Maybe because you don't have any plans with Siddhu. Is that right? Siddhu? What does he have to do with this? You cancelled our plan last time for him, didn't you? But I made this movie plan now, didn't I? Did I ask for it? Did I? Make all your plans with Siddhu. You don't have to sacrifice anything for me, Vineetha. Niharika, you're not speaking your mind. What's the matter? Please be clear. Hey, kids. What's up! Nothing much, Karthik. I was just leaving. What! She's very possessive, Meghana. Can't watch me growing close to anyone else. Wrong. If you become close to someone else... She's afraid that you won't give her as much importance. When you snatch a kid's favorite toy from him... This is exactly how he'd react. And, talking about toys... Siddhu. Do you like him? I do, Meghana. He's really sweet. But, he rushes into everything. You know what I mean? Like, very impulsive. Makes decisions in a split second. Deviates from them as quickly too. You think Karthik is Mr. Perfect? We should change them over time. So... "As I call out your name..." "I hear it echo in the layers of my heart" "As I knock the doors of your soul..." "Welcome me in with open arms" "As the distance begins to fade..." "It feels like a miracle" "My smile only widens" "Not settling for less this time" "Let our story unfold beautifully" "Let me add my name to yours" "Let me discover your adorable side" "Those glances that we share from across the room" "They make time slow down and push you towards me" "Before you come close and throw a smile at me" "Why don't you read what's in my heart?" "Let me be your sweet symphony" So, when will your parents be back? Tomorrow morning. Which means, you're going to throw me out of your house. Or... we could get married. You could stay. Shut up. So, Vineetha... -Hmm? Are your periods over? No. Hi, sir. How did you like the biryani? There are no spices in the biryani, man. Oh. Extremely sorry, sir. -I ordered one with extra spices, right? Can I replace the order, sir? Some more masala, maybe? -It's done. Nothing much you can do now. Come here. What? -Closer. Adarsh, get changed. Guys, ready. You go back. You come forward. He has all the pomp to fool his clients. Top photographer, I see. He's only doing Karthik-Meghana's pre-wedding photo shoot. Mm-hmm. I guess that's what's trending these days. Well, it's a huge set up. What's the deal? Hmm? Shut up. It's my gift to Karthik. So he's helping me out. You could just gift him a carton of beers and he'd chill. No! Okay. Just imagine. Meghana and Karthik have been in love for 7 years now. I've witnessed their entire journey together. But ever since they got engaged... They only seem more in love to me. I want to capture those moments. Hang a life-size photograph on their wall. Because 40 years later... It wouldn't be just a photograph. It's a feeling. And I want to be the one to give them that feeling. Welcome to Venugopal family. Over the years... I've felt the void of not having my husband around. But today... Meghana's got an extended family. In this happy moment... My husband would've been really happy if he was here. We love you, aunty. Meghana's family now. You don't worry. What say? -That's right, dad. Come on, aunty. We can't see you like this. You're an inspiration. -I'm fine. Just got a little emotional. We love you. -I'm fine. I'm fine. 'When we were getting all emotional...' 'A red sports car entered the premises.' 'Young Rebel Star Prabhas got down.' Holy shit! Prabhas attended your family function?! Not really, sir. I was just checking if you were paying attention. Hmm. Okay. Awesome. Awesome? Seriously? Listen... Instead of charging you in an eve teasing case... I'm listening to your story and you're playing me? You can be easily fooled, sir. Why would Prabhas attend their family function? Pavan... Release the petty theft guy. Lock this bastard in there. Also, grab my baton. Make sure to oil it. Why would you need to oil the baton, sir? -Don't screw with me, you asshole! Get lost! Why were you at the ladies hostel? Vineetha was furious that I missed my supplementary exam. Is that a reason to break up? We didn't actually break up, sir. I thought it'd get me your sympathy. You swore you wouldn't hit me. Alright then. Call your dad. Why, sir? -You guys are good friends, right? Ask him to come down. Sir, my dad's not the problem here. It's my mom. If she found out, she would cancel my Goa trip. Please, sir. Why are you going to Goa? -For that photo shoot I mentioned earlier. It's a gift from Vineetha. We've hired a top photographer. Niharika's uncle... -Who's Niharika now? Vineetha's best friend, sir. How could you forget? -What the hell! You're narrating from the beginning again. Just do the damn sign and get lost. Okay. Okay. Alright. Do I have to pay a fine? -Get the hell out! Hey! Watch yourself in Goa. -Okay, sir. Cops there are not as nice as I am. They'll shove a stick up your ass. Bloody hell! He didn't forge, did he? Hello. -Hello? Hello?! Yeah, aunty. Tell me. -I won't be in town for a couple of days. I can't look after Meghana's VISA processing. Is that fine? Yeah, okay. -Are you sure? Umm... Just a second. Vineetha, can you please call Siddhu? -Relax. I'm calling. And guys, be safe with the water. There was this guy in my circle. Waves just dragged him in. Take care. Bye. Vineetha... Where the hell are you guys? We came out on a jog. What nonsense! Is Karthik with you? -Yeah, he's right here. Karthik, Vineetha wants to talk to you. I'm putting him on line. Just shut up and come. -I'll call you back. Bro! Bro! Bro! You have a photo shoot. Vineetha will kill me. I think I need to go to the hospital, man. What is this nonsense, man! -It's okay. Relax. You're fine. Where did you bring us, dude? You only told me last night that you wanted to see nature. America batch, huh? No. They're from UK. He's James and that's Lisa. They met in Goa 5 years back. They're back here to have a Hindu marriage. Sweet. Siddhu wants to organize the whole thing. Are we here for a photo shoot or some foreigners' wedding? He's your boyfriend. You only handle him. You were saying? Okay. Let's go. Go where? You girls aren't coming. -What? We have to throw a bachelor party for Karthik and James here. Bro! -I can't, man. Sorry. Karthik? -No, thanks. My stomach is upset. Two pegs of brandy, warm water and honey is your fix. You're going to glow for the photo shoot tomorrow. Let's go! Dude, take us to the shore. -We have our photo shoot today. But Siddhu has no common sense. Huh? Meghana... Relax. -What relax, Karthik? She's supposed to talk to him. Boozing and fooling around all the time. Fine. What's next, hmm? Can we do a photo shoot tomorrow? -I'll talk to him. But Meghana, there's been a small issue regarding your VISA. We should go to Hyderabad urgently. I didn't mean to... -What the fuck, Karthik! VISA was your responsibility. You said your colleagues got it done. If you were incapable, you should've told me, right? Yeah. -This is just not happening. What about the photo shoot? Look. Our return tickets are already booked. Yeah? Okay? We will finish the photo shoot, dear. Karthik, it's getting late. Coming! What do we eat? Pancakes? Chocolate chip pancakes for me. Hi. -Hey. What's wrong? Nothing. Very tired. That's all. Vineetha, I know that you're a little upset. The photo shoot got cancelled. But you didn't have to take it out on me since morning. But you were the reason it got cancelled. Please don't be upset about something so petty. Karthik is coming back in 2 days. We'll do the photo shoot again. Don't just walk away. Karthik's clients are visiting from UK. They're not coming. Okay. But that isn't my fault. -See? The photo shoot is cancelled and you're least bothered. Vineetha, it's just a bloody photo shoot. It's not just a bloody photo shoot! I wanted to make it a beautiful memory for him. You go. Go get drunk. That's more important to you. Vineetha, please! -Please leave me alone, Siddhu. Don't nag me like this, Vineetha. What's your problem? My problem is that you're not serious about anything in life. Please! Not again. -Forget about the photo shoot. Right from your career choices... You got that job at Google for me. If I choose MBA in the US, you'd follow me there. What if you don't get in? Alright. What if you get in and I don't? -Then I won't go there. See? You don't have clarity or seriousness about anything in life. I'm doing all of this for you, Vineetha. I'm damn serious about you. I don't know. "Before I realize you're not around" "Don't show up and startle me" "My glances chase you everywhere" "And hit back at me like an arrow" 'Words can't describe this feeling" "Silence speaks a ton" "For the first time" "I've hurt you badly" "This is my plea" "Hoping you'd forgive me" Will you marry me? "What do I say to this love?" Right now. Right here. "We push and pull Rise and fall together" "Come fall into my arms already" "My glances chase you everywhere" "And hit back at me like an arrow" "Words can't describe this feeling" "Silence speaks a ton" Now this is what we call a crazy wedding. Siddhu... Siddhu... You were a bachelor until yesterday. But now, you're a husband. How do you feel? Now, this is what we call a crazy wedding. Siddhu? Siddhu? Are you talking about that shitty viral video? If it were you, I would've kicked your ass. Get this into your head. This isn't Vegas. You turned out to be like Ram Charan from the film 'Orange'. People will lose their minds over this love episode of yours. Hello. Hello, Srujana. -Hello. Did you eat? -Yeah, I did. Hey, what's wrong? -Nothing. Are you breaking up with me? -What? -I said are you breaking up with me? That's what I've been telling you since yesterday. So you've decided? -Yes. So you can screw...*** Get the hell out! Listen to me, you bastard! You asshole! Can you spell 'Government'? -No. You're a Government employee. Can you spell 'Government'? -No! Tell me. Can you spell 'Government'? You can't! Kiss her, man! Kiss her! Don't be scared. I'm right here. Shut up, guys! -They're on a roll! If you break down this video, we can understand a lot of things. My next project, I mean... So recently, I came across this video. Listen. You're influenced by the Western Culture. That doesn't give you a right to defame our own. Something clicked in that video for me. So I'm trying to develop that story. Some couple is chilling in Goa, getting married. We're chilling in our house, watching that video. They sparked cultural controversies and used cuss words. They deserve to be thrashed. When did feelings come into the picture? Don't you think it's wrong to get drunk and then get married? Everyone in that video, especially that guy and girl... They owe us an apology in public. Our country is either over-sensitive. Or there are too many jobless people in the country. Seems like they've played by all the elements that would make it viral. Looks well-planned. What did the video even have to go viral? There are going to be severe consequences. Take it easy, man. Chill out. What was that saying? Yeah, I got it. A random couple got married and public is making it their personal business. They're having fun at their wedding. Why would you get in the middle of that? Listen. If they're making it into a film, demand money. Don't give me that death stare. He's planning to make it into a movie. You might as well make money out of it. Alright then. See you guys. Wait. Stay a little longer. Have beer. Let's chill, dude. -I'll go, man. Don't let the Media get to you. -I said I have to go! I'm leaving. Why are you being a pain in the ass? Siddhu, come on! He's already frustrated. Why are you adding fuel to fire? Stop! Stop! Stop! This is not a 'drink and drive' case. You're drinking while driving. Come on out. Come on. Don't waste my time. Fuck! Are you going to bring that beer along? Take 200 rupees and let me go. -I don't accept bribes. Why are you testing him? I can smell the alcohol all the way from here. Sir! He was having beer while driving. Wow! "My friend is back from Goa" "Bow down to him, everyone!" Hey! You got married and become an Internet sensation. When are you throwing me a party? Anyway, tell me. Is it the same girl? Where did you go on your honeymoon? We broke up, sir. -Siddhu, enough! Don't lie again for sympathy sake. I'll let you go. Now tell me the truth. I'm seriosuly not lying, sir. -Really?! But it hasn't even been 5 months. Pavan, you heard that? Who the fuck is that? Bring him over. Hello! -Hey! What's wrong? What's up? Let's go. Are we going to your officer? -Yes, let's go. I don't mind. Hello, sir. What were you doing there? -I was a bit drunk, sir. I don't know about my driver but. He saw the check post and vanished. Give me a driver and I'll head home. -We should give you a driver? Who on Earth would have a driver for a bike? I have money, sir. So I hired one. What do you do? -I'm an actor, sir. In soap operas? -No, sir. In movies. Didn't you watch 'Gabbar Singh'? -'Gabbar Singh', huh? Stand back there. Why are you ignoring me, sir? Your story is boring. After all, you hired a driver for your bike. This guy over here has issues with his girl. Let's hear him out. Stand back. -Move it. Tell me, Siddhu. What's to tell, sir? You watched that video, right? That was it. [singing randomly] 'Guys, hush! Teacher is here.' 'Ma'am, I didn't finish my homework.' -'What's with the garlands?' 'We two are married now.' 'Do whatever the hell you can.' 'Siddhu, don't say that. -Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry.' 'I forgot that you two are best friends.' 'In fact, why didn't you both go on our honeymoon?' 'You should make out, guys. Make out! Make out!' 'You turned out to be like Ram Charan from the film 'Orange'. People will lose their minds over this love episode of yours. 'Ma'am, don't touch!' 'This is not our culture.' 'Stop being a grandma. Fuck culture!' 'Vineetha and I honestly wanted to get married and that's what we did.' 'Kiss her, man! Kiss her!' I spend 30,000 dollars on the Digital Media Department per annum. You guys realize? You need my permission to pull this down from the Internet? Alright. Summon PRO Prabhu. Spend money. Bribe people. Bloody buy them out! I don't care. Okay, sir. Thank you so much. Bro, I just spoke with 'Silly Monks' Sanjay. He swore to pull it down from the website. -Please make sure, bro. Extremely sorry, bro. -Please make it quick. It's not a big deal. It'll be off the website in a couple of days. But we need damage control on these Whatsapp groups. Bastards take screenshots. Hello, mom. Stop calling me so many times. I said I'll call you back, okay? Please! Mom, stop bothering me. I said I'll talk to you later. We were just partying, mom. My mom and your mom spoke with each other. They're feeling really low. They can't even step out of the house. And my dad's acting up. I was dancing drunk and shirtless and you didn't bother to stop me? I should've told you? Didn't you realize what you were doing? I'm neck deep in problems. Stop being such a pussy. You're so self-obsessed, I mean... -Damn right, I am! Don't watch that stuff. I'm here for you. Hello. -You have a flight to Vizag in 2 hours. Pack your bags. I'll see you there. Mani... I'm sorry, dad. I don't want your apology. I want an explanation from you. And Siddhu as well. Where are your used clothes? You can't mix them with fresh ones. -Mom... Mom...! I'm sorry. It's okay. What did dad say? -What do you think? He's blaming himself. Saying he's responsible. -How come? When you make a mistake, he doesn't blame you. Doesn't let me scold you either. Making mistakes is really important. There's no point in yelling at you. You should learm from your own mistakes. His words. Your dad and I have a difference of opinion in this context. But what you did now... It has affected everyone around you. And he's taking responsibility for it. In situations like these... The girl becomes the easy target in the current society. So, Vineetha needs you now. More than ever. Okay? Two cappuccinos, please. -Is this hotel far from here? I'll just go talk to them and come. -Let's leave. I don't know how to handle this situation, Siddhu. I have no clue. -Baby, listen... Why are you crying? I'm right here, okay? Actually, it's my fault. I only rushed into it. I didn't think of the repercussions. Now you're hurt because of me. -Siddhu, stop! Please! Sorry. I'm really sorry. It's okay. I said it's fine. -I'm really sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen. -It's okay. I'm here for you. Huh? You know I can't see you like this. You're my strength and you know it. Promise? -I promise. Come on. Now give me that sexy smile of yours. I know that my smile isn't that sexy. It's not? Who told you? Hmm? Those dimples... And those eyes that melt my heart... What? Uncle... I'm sorry. It's my fault. What are you apologizing for? For marrying my daughter? Or for the leaked video? Trust me when I say this wasn't planned. Vineetha and I had a fight in Goa. I wanted to show her how serious I was about her. He doesn't care about what the world has to say about us. We've become a bloody joke in the community. -Karthik! You weren't there, okay? You don't know what happened there. -Then tell me! I'll understand. How could you guys be so foolish? Karthik! Calm down. Do you know the repercussions of this dirty little feat? My father never said a thing to me throughout my life. And now I'm out of the family. Uncle... -Dad! Have some water. Dad! Dad, are you okay? -I'm okay! I'm okay. Okay, Siddhu. Everybody back at home is curious. What do I tell them? I don't care about what they think, uncle. I'm only answerable to you. Every time they talk about Vineetha... They will bring up her father, right? Uncle. We did a mistake. We're also married now. What do you want me to do now? Because you two are married... You're saying I can't touch you. I didn't mean it like that, uncle. -That's not what he said, dad. Shut up, Vineetha! Did I say something wrong? Are you also saying I can't do anything because you two are married? Why are you so arrogant? Didn't you parents teach you basic etiquette? Uncle, please! Why are you involving my parents? I don't have to do that again, Siddhu. They're responsible for your actions. I guess they didn't bother to correct your mistakes. Idiots! Dad, please! It's his parents we're talking about. Sid, I'm sorry. Uncle, listen. I didn't want to say this. But I'll let it out now. We're already married. What can you do? There's something you don't know yet. We also slept together. Now talk. Karthik! Karthik, no! Karthik, don't. Let him go! Please! Just stop! No! Calm down. Siddhu, I'm sorry. Damn it! You need to apologize to my dad. Apologize, take your bag and get out of my house. You can't be serious, man! -What's wrong, bro? What you did has already embarrassed her in front of her family. How could you add fuel to fire? Why does everyone keep saying that I messed this up? Bro, this is how the blame game works. Whoever's fault it was, it's the guy who's blamed. You seem to know about the blame game a little too well. What are you still doing here? -Give me a driver and I'll go, sir. There you go about the driver again! How many drinks did you have? About three small bottles, sir. -Why did you drink so much? I had a break up, dude. Do you have anything going on in your life except for break ups? Sir, you're cheating. What did I do now? You're clarifying your doubts about his love story. But you're not letting me clariify mine. What are your doubts? It was raining outside. He was banging his girlfriend in the car. Before he got to the interesting part, story jumped a few scenes. What the hell did you just say about my girlfriend? Hey! Are you kidding me 'cause I'm soft? What! Huh? I'm going to break your bones into pieces, mind you! It's my wife you're talking about. Show some respect. Or I'll beat your ass up. Do you have a cigarette, bro? -I don't smoke. Have you gone mad? He's not going to narrate now. What did I say, sir? -What? Seriously? You don't know what you said? Didn't you say I was banging my girlfriend? I didn't mean to offend you, bro. -Offend me, my ass! How could you say that? You said you have an ex-girlfriend. Will you take it if I insult her? Asshole! -Sir! He just called me an asshole! He's young blood. Ignore it. Now apologize. I said apologize to him. Sorry, bro. -Get lost! I don't care. Will you listen to the rest of the story or go home? I'll listen to the story, sir. Yes. What next? Did you eat anything? -No. Come and eat. What happened? There was a fight. What fight? Alright. You should take a break for a while. Will you go to your aunt's place? Dad... -Yeah? When are your exams starting? 22nd. -You only have 15 days. And how many backlogs? Four. -Concentrate. Enough of monkey business. I think it's time you get serious now, Siddhu. Hi. How did your exams go? Not bad. I'm staying with Karthik now. Come and talk to him once. Okay. About what? Apologize to him. You want me to apologize? When Karthik hits me, who should be the one to apologize? When you spoke with my father the way you did... Who should be the one to apologize? From the minute I walked in to your house that day, all I did was apologize to him. Your parents said mean things about my parents and pushed me. That was wrong. I agree. But think about it from his perspective. We made a mistake that exposed us to the whole world. We're at fault. Why are you so arrogant anyway? What have you achieved in life? Even your job... you got it for me. That's how loose your motivation is. Here. I cracked this job for you, right? I don't need it. Siddhu... Meghana's mother cancelled the wedding. I came to discuss the same with you. But obviously, I expected a little too much from you. We're not right for each other, Siddhu. We can't be together with all these differences. Bye. ['Raavoi Chandamama' song playing] Two things. Number one... She doesn't belong from our family. You're a journalist. Get your facts right. And number two... Isn't this a professional interview? Aren't your questions out of place? Now do you see why I had to cancel the wedding? We live in the age of Internet. Meghana. Our entire life is an open book. You'll hate me now. But one day you'll come and thank me. ['Raavoi Chandamama' song continues playing] I waited for your mom outside the conference hall for 2 hours. But she didn't even spare 2 minutes for me. What do you want me to do now? Fall at your mom's feet? If you don't intend on fixing this situation, just say it. You don't have to do me a favor. Meghana... Don't be silly. Silly, huh? Pick up. Siddhu... How are you, man? Ask me how I'm doing. Listen... -Don't you dare hang up on me. Hear me out or I'll be at your doorstep next. How long since you and Vineetha have been together? A year? Mine was 6 years. I had to go to great lengths to finally get engaged. Do you even understand the process behind getting married? You need to literally beg the girl's parents. Convince them that you'd take good care of her. First you need to be sure whether you can look after her, you asshole! Karthik, I... -Don't talk. I was so friendly with you, man. We also had drinks together. Why did you come into my life, Siddhu? The villain of my life! How do you sleep at night? Bro, you should never cross the line. But you went ahead and shat all over it. I know she shouldn't be messed with and I don't even know the full story. If she thought our marriage was a mistake, why did she agree to it? Because she didn't know you're a fool. The basic difference between you and Vineetha is... She's still doing her job. -Fuck it, sir! Fuck it! I'd rather get drunk than see her at work every day. I don't speak your slang, man. Save it. What should I do, sir? What should I do? Should I touch her feet? Listen... I understand that you're in pain and frustration. Above all, you have a big ego. Instead of banging vessels on the floor when you're angry... Cook something in them. It's called therapy. Pavan, who was that director whose movie came out recently? Christopher Nolan, sir. You know Christopher Nolan? He made a film on a different planet for 5 years called 'Interstellar'. And you're still roaming around in Chilakalaguda. What else do you want me to do, sir? My problem is, I put her above myself. That's my problem. That is why it came to this. I should just jump off of some building. Why do you think I'm listening to your story? I had a son who looked just like you. In fact, he was 2 inches taller. He was an amazing football player. Goalkeepers would shit their pants. But it was all for nothing. He failed in love and committed suicide. I had to perform his final rites. No one can solve your problem. Want to know why? Your problem is... yourself. We're done here, guys. Where the hell were you? Are you out of your mind? I saw the cops and ran! Bastard! Let's get out of here. -Did something go wrong? Why doesn't she pick up? -Who? Meghana's mom. You're not some big shot that she'd answer your call. What the hell are we doing out here anyway? Let's go. You can leave if you have to. I can handle it by myself. I don't need you here. Go. You tag me along on all your cheap tricks. And then you dominate me. Your ego gets in the way, huh? Don't call me next time. I'm not going to come. Karthik got fed up trying. Thank you, ma'am. -Now it's you. Aunty, listen... -Siddhu, this is my workplace. You guys should stop troubling me. I won't listen to you... get all emotional... and change my decision. Got it? -But Meghana is... Have some coffee before you leave. Bro! Bro! Bro! Bro, please! Please, bro. Shit! Damn! I'm sorry. What happened? Dad, do you and mom fight anytime? -So many times. Do you apologize even when it's mom's fault? Who is to decide between right and wrong? The way you're drinking with me right now... It's wrong according to your mom. But I'm okay with it. Because... Here, you stop at two drinks. But then outside, there's no keeping tabs. Right and wrong is only a perception. Okay. I made a mistake. I agree. I'm sorry. But I wasn't alone in this. -Everybody makes mistakes. No one has a problem with someone's positive side. Living with a person means living with his/her weaknesses. Let's forget about you and Vineetha for a second. Karthik and Meghana are deeply hurt because of this. I tried talking to Meghana's mother 'n' number of times. She will not speak. Their problem will not be solved. -Of course! Why would it? Right now your motivation is... If you solve their problem... Your problem with Vineetha goes away. Where's your honesty in that? Because you caused the problem, solve it. Take responsibility. Don't do it for yourself. Do it for them. And Siddhu, listen. What's with the puppy face? Be a man. Widen your chest. It's not the end of the world. Hi. My name is Siddhu. Almost 3-4 months back... So many of you watched me and my girlfriend... You watched me and my ex-girlfriend get married. Some of you said it was fun. While some of you hated it. Said it was offensive towards women. That we insulted our culture. I can't function without a cup of coffee every morning. That's how common and average of a guy I am. What would I hold against anyone? Why would I? Dad... I'm really sorry. This is my fault. Not yours. You don't deserve a son like me. But every son deserves a father like you. All of you must've moved on from this video. I don't know. Maybe to a new viral video. Bigg Boss or something else. But we're still stuck in the same moment. This video ruined the lives of two people who had nothing to do with it. It's not fair that they have to suffer the wrath. I got married in a hurry to prove how much I love my girlfriend. This situation is a consequence of that. If that video hadn't been uploaded... We wouldn't have captured the most beautiful moment in our lives. We had a few drinks to celebrate that feeling. Some guy said, 'Want me to rape her?' And some of the nasty comments some of you posted... She might be the college topper. You never know. Maybe she did everything right in her life. Her only mistake was... Choosing to love me. Everyone says this is our fault. But think about it. Think about our pain. To everyone who got offended and hurt by watching this video... I'm really sorry. And I'm sorry only about the video going live. Not sorry about marrying her. I'm very proud to have married a girl like Vineetha. I married her once. And I'd marry her another hundred times. How many people watched this video? 3,000-4,000 views, ma'am. Very less. And the other video? -Almost 7 million people, ma'am. That's funny, right? Alright. Call our PRO Prabhu and ask him to boost the video as much as he can. I want everyone to watch it in the next 2 weeks. Out! -Okay, ma'am. And then? Did Vineetha send divorce papers? No, sir. One day, her father dropped by and invited us to Karthik's wedding. Mom, Siddhu is standing and eating. Look. Siddhu, did you try the pickle? -I'm good, aunty. Why doesn't he just sit down, aunty? He's like that. Let him be. Hi. Hi. Catering is... -Siddhu. Vineetha is upstairs. Oh. Give. No. It's okay. -Come on, give. Uncle... -Hmm? I'm really sorry, uncle. That's okay. Still, I'm sorry. So, what happened with him? -Your boy... just turned into a man. Really? I don't think so. What? Vineetha's mom asked for you. Quick. It's urgent. Go. -Vineetha, I'm going downstairs. Come fast. Hi. -Hi. Your dad dropped by and invited me. -Hmm? Okay. You sent him, didn't you? Maybe. -Maybe? What if my dad didn't come? -I would've waited. How long? -Till you texted me. Because... I love you. Good. Come in. And shut the door behind you. Okay. He always skips at the right moment. What happened next, bro? I'll break your bones! -I'll break your bones! It's all good, right? Why are you back here? Come on, sir. I thought we'd go out and have a few drinks. Oh, is it? What say/ Let's go, bro. -Bro? I'll smack you naked. Hey! How's the Malakpet bike case coming along? We didn't find the bike, sir. -You never will. Let's go. Sir... Sir... Hold on. I have a small surprise for you both. Hi! Come. Your wife? -Yes, sir. Hello. -Hello. Hello. I'm Fish Venkat. -Of course! I've seen you in movies. Very nice to meet you. -Don't flatter yourself. Sit down. Please sit. Siddhu is always talking about you. Really? -Yeah. But he never told me about you. Oh, yeah? But I've heard a lot about you. What did he tell you? Everything. Top to bottom. Everything? Top to bottom? So you're telling everyone about our personal life? I was just sharing, you know. We all went viral. So you say anything you want to? -They know everything. What's the big deal? -Why did you tell them if they already knew? Were you exaggerating about me? -We were just talking. What the hell, man. It's wife-husband drama all over again!
