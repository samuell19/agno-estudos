That's a good-looking family, Missy. You're a good dog. We'll find good homes for the lot. You can be proud. Couple of months or so, we'll advertise. We'll make sure they grow healthy, you and I. We lost again. What a terrible game. There's nothing lonelier than coming home to an empty house after losing a game. What's the matter, big brother? I was just thinking that a boy needs someone to welcome him home after a defeat, like a dog or something. Well, you have me. Welcome home. Thank you, but that's not the same thing. Lila, honey, it's a great puppy farm. The owner really cares for the dogs. He has the best reputation in town. And as a present, you just choose the dog you want. Oh, thanks, Mom! I love you. I'll take that one, the one named Snoopy. They got great homes. I think we can be proud. We got 'em loving people, and we've done what we set out to do. But, Mom, they can't do that. It's too unfair. His heart will break. How could I ever tell him? Snoopy, I have to talk to you. You're a good puppy, and I love you very much. I can't believe it, but my family says we can't keep you anymore. They have a new rule here. The landlord here says that no dogs are allowed in the building. So I'm very sorry, Snoopy, but we have to take you back. Goodbye, Snoopy. I'm gonna miss you. We'll find you a great home, boy. I haven't failed yet. -You know what, Linus? -What? I think a boy growing up should have a dog of his own. A dog to greet him when he comes home from school. A dog to go to the park with him and fetch a stick or a ball. A boy without a dog is like a day without sunshine. I thought that was a meal without wine. Hey, Sally, listen to this. "Hunting dog, almost purebred for sale. Young, easy to train, very cheap." A hunting dog, cheap! I think we should get it. "Daisy Hill Puppy Farm." That's right on the edge of town. We could take the bus. No, thanks. I don't wanna ride way out to the edge of town. Besides, he'll be your dog. You go out and buy him. I think this dog is going to be special. Hi, Charlie Brown. Great news, Linus. I'm gonna get a dog. Come with me to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm. I'm gonna buy a hunting dog, a beagle! Will you come with me? Sure, Charlie Brown. Good morning, sir. I saw your ad in the paper about a puppy. Yes, but can you afford it? Oh, yes, sir. We have money, and we're ready to do business. Well, I am looking for a good home for this puppy. He is a good dog and not too expensive. I'd like a top dog, sir. The pick of the litter. I have five dollars. Well, for this top dog, that's not much money, but you seem like the right person. I guess I can let him go for five dollars. I promise you, sir, I am the right person, and here's my five dollars. You're a good horse trader. Yes, sir. I am a tough bargainer. May we see the puppy now? Puppy's in the shed next to the house. The dog's name is Snoopy. That's a pretty good name. We'll keep it. While you were talking to the man, I was looking through their records. Someone else bought this dog, but then returned him. You got a used dog, Charlie Brown. Well, you're my dog now, Snoopy. I'll show you to your new home. This is your house, Snoopy. The first thing we should do, Snoopy, is to teach you a few simple rules. When I say sit, you immediately sit. Snoopy, sit. Sit, Snoopy. Well, that wasn't quite what I meant. Now look, Snoopy, I want you to learn to act on command. Now when I say speak, you should speak. Speak, Snoopy. Speak. Gee, I can't believe I've had Snoopy for over a year now. You certainly have an unusual dog, Charlie Brown. He's an unusual dog, all right. What's the matter with Snoopy, Charlie Brown? What are you doing out of bed? I just went to get a drink of water. What are you doing up, big brother? I was just looking out there. Snoopy's been with us for almost four years. He's always been a very happy dog, but every now and then he seems sort of melancholy. Maybe he's thinking about his family. Maybe he's thinking about all his brothers and sisters and wondering what ever happened to all of them. You know, you could be right. Maybe we should see if we can get them all together. Snoopy, we've been thinking about your family. Your brothers and sisters, and the place where you were born. We've decided you should have a reunion. We'll send invitations to all your brothers and sisters, and we'll have a great party. And maybe even go back and visit the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm. What do you think of that? We'll send one to Belle, to Spike and Olaf. Mustn't forget Marbles. Molly, Rover, Andy. They're here, big brother! They're here! Huh? Who's here? Snoopy's brothers and sisters, a whole herd of dogs. Dogs? This is great. They all got here. Okay, okay. Now, you're all here. This is the plan. We're gonna have to get on a bus and go to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm for the reunion. You'll all have a chance to return to your home. Will you please call us when we get to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm? Daisy Hill. Okay, I'll let you know. I don't recognize anything. This can't be right. Is this the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm? This is Daisy Hill, kid. You and your gang gonna get off? It doesn't look like the right place. This is it. This is it. This is the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm. I found it. It was here. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. That's all that's left. This is where your old home was. There's no more Daisy Hill Puppy Farm. It's gone. They built a five-story parking lot on it. You realize what's happened? They're parking on your memories. You know, big brother, what's-his-name is right. You can't go home again. Well, it wasn't the best reunion, but it was a reunion. Now, how are all of you going to get home? Now, how did he do that? Well, he's your dog, Charlie Brown.
