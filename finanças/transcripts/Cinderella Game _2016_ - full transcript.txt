When my sister was on stage as an Idol, her dress sparkled under the spotlights. So cute, so dazzling... But one year ago, she disappeared. At that time, an offer came in from her agency. To be honest, I was feeling lost. Should I take on her dream? I devoted myself to try just has hard as her to make her dream come true! Hana! - Erina, what's going on? - I don't know! Last I remember, after the performance was over, we went back to Tokuya... but it's all blank after that. What is all this? It's like a promo photo shoot for Idol groups. Look, that little one over there. Isn't that Rin Momozono from Lillypad Academy? And that slick one over there. Isn't that Rui Kureba from that cross-dressing group? And that over there is DNS's Yukino Shiraishi! Yukino Shiraishi? Right, she got kicked out of her group for her violent temper. But you didn't hear that from me. Hana! Erina! Leader! Suzuka-san! You're okay! You're okay, right? I don't get this at all. - Why are even you here, Leader? - I told you to stop calling me that. - Erina is always... - That! What's this? Oh, sorry, I mistook you for a gorilla from behind. Thank God you don't have a banana or I couldn't tell the difference. Well if it isn't the dollar whore? What are you doing up off your back? - You've put on weight. - You bitch! Stop it! Who are you? I'm Haitani. Sana Haitani. Oh, are you Sari Haitani's sister? What's going on? Congratulations! You are the lucky twenty chosen for this illustrious audition. I will be your friendly host, Takimoto. The pleasure is all mine. From here on, you'll all be participating in the Cinderella Game on this island. - Cinderella? - Game? A simple competitive card game. The cards have already been scattered throughout the island. Starting at 7am, you will gather cards. At 7pm, you'll all meet at the battle arena located behind me. You will each take part in one match per day. Incidentally, be sure to peruse the bag you've been provided. Within it, you'll find a map which will surely be of use in this game. Make sure not to loose it. In this game, you will compete until only one challenger remains. Arrangements will be made for the champion to become Top Idol. So be sure to give it your all as if your life depended on it! Top Idol? Like I said, the central personality of the nation's leading Idol group. A solo album sales deal! An MC position on a variety show. And a contract with a major advertising company. You will surely be elevated to claim the title of Top Idol! In short, a splendid Cinderella story is within each of your reach! This is some sort of hidden camera reality TV show, isn't it? May I have a word with the producers? Please listen to what people have to say until the very end. And someone who couldn't move merch to save her life... would do well to not talk like such a big shot. You've all been discarded from the Idol World! Just worthless trash posing as Idols. Oh really? Don't screw with me. I see, so you're running away? Understood. Number 14, You Tanabe-san. Disqualified. What is this? Why is it beeping? What is this? What are you doing? This is network broadcast TV, right? Yes, yes, yes! Please quiet down. Otherwise you too will be disqualified! As you just saw, you're wearing a collar with a poisoned syringe inside. At my command, the poisoned needle will pierce your spine from behind. And you will die. By the way, we've obtained permission from each of your agencies... We've paid quite a sum of money to make all this happen, so be sure to try hard and do your best! With that, I will now explain the rules. If you don't want to die, you'd do well to listen real closely. Scattered across this island, you will find the Prince, Stepmother and Witch. Prince beats Stepmother. Stepmother beats Witch. Witch beats Prince. While searching for cards, if you happen upon a nearby card, you'll see an indicator such as this. From here, head to the dot on your map to locate the card. After a suitable opponent is decided upon, you'll choose one of your cards. If your card beats your opponent's card, you get to stay alive. It's also possible to use option cards to produce particular effects. As the game progesses, you'll gain points for meeting special conditions... which you can use to purchase these cards. Please purchase your option cards prior to the start of battle. By the way... you'll be disqualified if you are violent toward another player. All of the rules are available on your devices. Each of you would do well to review them. And with that, your worthless trash posing as Idols! Put your lives on the line and aim to become Cinderella! Ready... Start! Look, you'd better hurry! You don't want to lose! There's only room for one Cinderella! Your dreams lie within your reach! I want this all to be a bad dream. - It's so frightening. - What? Killing people and stuff. But if we don't find at least one card, it's gonna be us that get killed. It's close, huh? I think it's around here somewhere. Erina, here! Eh, it's even more tacky than I imagined... Sana, you should hold on to this. But I only found it because of you. It's fine, take it. Stop! Stop! What's that all about? Sana! Stop it! Mind your own business! Give me the cards! Give them to me! Give me the cards! Number 2, Moemi Koiyama-san, disqualified. Were you all listening to the rules? Violence is strictly prohibited! Are you okay? Say, do you remember which way we came from? Let's go, okay? Thank you for helping me back there. You can call me Rinko Momo. I'm from Lillypad Academy. I'm 15 years old. - Why were you being chased? - I found a card and picked it up. Then I heard a voice from behind yelling "hand it over!". Oh, the girl from before? It's close! This way! I found it! I found it! Here you go! You should hold onto it, Rin-chan! - But what about you? - Don't worry! I'll take the next one we find. Okay, thanks! Let's go! Sure! I think we should head back. We don't want to be late. Okay. I wonder if I can win... You'll be fine. You've got one of each of the three types. That should be enough to win at least one match. What about you? How many do you have? Me? I have... these! I'll be okay! Rin-chan? Look, you should know better! Your cards are the same as your life. You shouldn't just whip them out. Well, there'd be no point in you holding onto these. Cause I've got to win. I've got to be the cutest in the world! Wait! Sana! Erina, thank goodness you're safe! It will soon be 7pm. Please ensure you've purchased all option cards you'll require by the deadline. Option cards? Remember? Those things you buy with points? My points have gone up. But why? You probably met one of those special conditions he was talking about. Pumpkin carriage? - How many cards did you get? - Not even one. Seriously? No way, how could you not even get one? Anyway, you'd better purchase at least one then. Okay. Five minutes until battle commences! Please make your way to the battle arena. Sana, do you want some of my cards? I got quite a few. - It's okay, I'm fine. - But... Let's go. Match one. Ayame Shigakki-san versus Takako Mukae-san. Now then, please set a card out face down. Are you really going to decide who lives and who dies like this? Let's begin the match. Card, open! Stepmother is stronger than Witch. The winner is number 19, Ayame Shigakki-san! No... not like this! No! Mouse-san will now guide the winner to her lodgings! She's like a hyena! Spectacular! Match six. Rin Mouzoro-san versus Sana Haitani-san. Good luck, lady. Wait a sec, you don't have any cards, do you? Sana Haitani-san, please accept your option cards. Option cards? No fair! Card, set! Card, open! Witch versus Pumpkin carriage. It's a draw. A draw? What? Did I forget to explain the option cards? Pumpkin carriage forces a draw. Stroke of Midnight neutralizes Pumpkin carriage. The glass slipper is so expensive we may as well not bother discussing it. What's that all about? Let's get right back to it. Card, set! My mother told me to pick the very best one and you are it! This one! How about you, lady? No more cards, huh? Geez. Card, open! Draw. Pumpkin again? Draw. Draw! Draw! Card, set! Sis, that's... not a Pumpkin is it? Number 8, Sana Haitani-san, please set out a card. Just one more card and that girl's death will be decided. That idiot. Did you hear me? Sis! Ah, what a bother. If you don't place a card within the next 3 seconds, you will be disqualified. Three. Sana! Put down a card! Two. One. Card, open! Draw! I'm out. I'm out of cards. Number 10, Rin Moumozorou-san... has no more cards! Disqualified. No, I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Hey, this isn't cute you know! Hey, Mama! I want my Mama! Mama! Mama always told me I was born to be a Top Idol! She always told me I was born to make everyone happy. If I get rich, I'm gonna buy Mama a big castle! I... I... There was nothing you could do. It's not your fault. Okay, okay, break it up! Move out of the way, please. You should've died instead! If you hate it that much, then it'd been better if you'd died. Card, open! Witch versus Prince. Prince loses. The winner is number 5, Suzuka Aoi-san! No! No! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Sana? Erina? Erina? - I thought it was you. - Erina, you're still alive? I won't lose that easily. Easily? - I'm really glad we both won. - Yeah. Hey Sana, I was thinking, why don't we team up? Huh? Team-up? - Share our cards. - What do you mean? We collect cards separately, then pool them together before the match and choose whichever we want. - Can we do that? - Yeah. Ayame took cards that didn't belong to her earlier, right? Suzuka-san, let's team up with Suzuka-san, too. Leader too, huh? Something seems off about her. Sana, I think you should focus on looking out for yourself. If you keep worrying about others you're gonna get yourself killed. You have to pull through this for your sister's sake too, right? If Sari were here, she'd have the same feelings. But she'd want you to do what it takes to make it out alive. Sister... Sister! Good morning! It's almost 7am. Anyone not present by then will be disqualified. - What's wrong? - Suzuka-san's not here. Suzuka-san! Did everyone have a heart breakfast? Well then, let's once again give it our all for day two! Ready! Start! Alright, I'm leaving the south side to you. Got it. I couldn't just watch you get hurt right in front of me. Thank you very much. If you'd fallen, you would at least have broken some bones. I didn't help you as a volunteer. But... It seems we both may be too kind for our own good. I see. Understood. Takimoto-san! How may I help you, Number 19, Ayame Shigakki-san? You know... I would do anything to get to the top... Anything. Anything. Anything. Alright! Are you alright? What? Do you want me to thank you or something? No... You're better off finding someone dumber to help. You're only acting nice to other people to protect yourself. Always with others, never doing anything by yourself. "How about that desperate, abandoned loner?" I'm not so desperate to stay alive that I'd be that naive. Hey, that's not allowed! There are no cameras in here. Thinking like a low-life as always, I see. Shut up! I would do anything to get to the top! If that means I've got to do some nasty things, so be it! Now close your eyes and it'll all be over. If I lose, it'll all be for nothing. Everything I've done will be for nothing! Why? Why? Why? Why?! I want to win them over. All the people who've made fun of me. I want them to say "she's gotten so cute, so sweet, she's really become amazing!" I want everyone to love me. From here I can observe everyone in more detail than you might think. Number 19, Ayame Shigakki-san, disqualified. Let the second day's battles commence. - Did you request any option cards? - Stroke of Midnight and Pumpkin carriage. Alright. Match one. Tsuna Mi versus Erina Kanahara. If I lose, make sure to get my cards before my opponent does. What? Card, set! Hurry up! It all comes down to luck anyway. Card, open! Stepmother versus Pumpkin carriage. It's a draw. Hey, hurry up! Card, open! Witch versus Stroke of Midnight. Stroke of Midnight loses. Why? It's an option card? It's true that Stroke of Midnight beats Pumpkin carriage, however... it cannot win against normal cards. That can't be! You'd better not even consider losing. The winner is number 17, Yukino Shiraishi-san. Don't touch me! The winner is number 5, Suzuka Aoi-san. Match four. Rui Kurebayashi-san versus Sana Haitani-san. I think this game is a psychological battle. I'm going to put out a Prince. I will... put out a Witch. A Witch? If you're not lying, you'll win and the match will be over. Card, open! Stepmother versus Pumpkin carriage. It's a draw. You chickened out, didn't you? You're a liar, aren't you? Next, I'll put out a Stepmother. Card, open! Draw! This is my last card. It's a Pumpkin carriage. - I... - Sana-san... If it was possible, I would've really liked to have met you under other circumstances. If you don't put out a card, you'll be disqualified. You and I... are somehow alike. Card, open! Stroke of Midnight versus Pumpkin carriage. Pumpkin carriage loses. The winner is number 8, Sana Haitani-san! I wanted to try it in practice. I was the only one who was the real thing. Everyone else was a normal girl, right? I've always been searching for the place I belong. That's something I've always needed. A way to stay true to myself. Sana, are you listening? Yeah. How about we work together tomorrow? Huh? I detected a lot of cards bunched up on the eastern plateau today. But I decided not to check it out. A lot? Ten or so... But why would ten cards all be together? It could be a trap. I'd feel better if we went and checked it out together. If we'd split up and searched the island on day one, I bet we'd have 50 cards now. But it's getting harder to find them. Even if we searched the island separately now... I doubt we'll find more than ten total. This way we can add five a piece for our share. We... We... are probably going to have to face each other tomorrow, huh? To be honest, I don't think it's possible for us to return home together. But you know... as long as one of us becomes Top Idol, I have a feeling Sari would be happy. No matter the outcome... let's do our best. Everyone! I just love the looks on your faces! Well then, let's give it our all once again for day three! Ready! Start! Sana! Over here! What is all this? They're screwing with us. A decoy? There should be 10 real ones among the fakes. You really can't do anything by yourself, huh? Do you know what the word "unit" means? Even if split apart, a member's only purpose is to serve the greater whole. That's its only reason for existing. Each member must have total trust in others in order to benefit the unit. So you followed us here, huh? I won't let you have them that easily. Sana, hurry and gather them. I won't accept that! - Let go! - You let go! That's... Are you going to laugh? You did that to be funny, right? - Give it back. - No way. Give it back! You should have your match with Sana looking like that. - Since that's your true form after all. - Give it back! This isn't how I really am! When this is all over, I can go back to how I used to be. I'm not listening, Cyclops! - Give it back! - Erina! Stay out of it! Give it back! Give it back! Give it back! Give it back! Give it back! Give it back! Did you forget the rules? Ow! Ow! It hurts! It hurts! Number 17, Yukino Shiraishi-san, disqualified. Violence is forbidden, need I remind you? Within beauty, I believe lies all the power of this world. Being pretty or ugly can mean a lifetime of happiness and fortune... That's why I'm determined to find the value within me. What's with that look? We would've had to kill her eventually. And don't tell me "this or that is wrong". You and I are in the same boat. "I wanna reach the top, but I'm not going to kill people." It truly must be a happy little world that you live in, huh? - It's not like that. - It is like that! You're the hardest to bear out of all this. Scolding others from your high horse while not doing anything yourself. Just floating around carefree. An idol who just sits on her ass and hopes for the best. What does that accomplish? I don't... Apart from us, there's only one left. Maybe it's time we part ways. Monsters... Monsters, we're all monsters! I can't keep going on like this. I can't be a monster that kills others for my own sake. Hey, wait! How do you like this, huh? - What are you doing? - Suzuka-san! Stay away! You thought you liked and respected me, didn't you? Watch out! Let go! Let me go! Sana, let's pull her up together! Suzuka-san! Suzuka-san! Why is it... do you know why it is that within this world... no matter up or down, no matter if you win or lose. What? Do you know the chances of any of us even being born? One in 4 billion. Just for being born in this world, all of us are already special and lucky. Thank you for saving me. Sana, I'm sure... you will become someone special to many others as well. Suzuka-san. Suzuka-san! Suzuka-san! A leader is different from all the other members of the group. A leader must always think of what's best for the group. Just being the most popular is not enough. But with that being said, she is an idol after all. So she'll still try her hardest to get to the top. Erina! Help me! I'm sorry, Sana. The one who killed both you and your sister was me. I just wanted to win the game and be at the top. But now I realize how awful I've been to everyone. Sana, I've realized why I can't keep skittering. Being an idol is like being a spider atop a slender thread. Skitter, skitter, skitter. If you stop, you've as good as fallen. After all, what else is there, but to keep skittering? I wouldn't know. Haitani Sana-san, out of twenty people, the last one left alive... is you! Why did you kill her? - If, for two years in a row, the same... - Two years? It's just like she said, she's the champion of last year's battle. She defeated your sister in the grand finals. However, the chairman decided it wouldn't be interesting to have the same winner. So she was disqualified. To be frank, our audience has grown tired of her. This game is a show. The hidden cameras on the island allow our subscribers... that is to say our audience, to tune in via pay-per-view broadcast. The pay-per-view fees are invested by our viewers into the points you've gotten. Those points are your popularity, or rather the manifestation of our viewers' love. Well then, our viewers wish for the next match... There's no one left to face. But there is! Sana, it's been so long! I surprised you, didn't I? Sister? It's true that she was defeated by Erina Kanehara-san in the previous grand finals, but rather than dying, it seems fate had other plans in store. Why? He's saying I've been given another chance to become Top Idol. That's what Takimoto-san said! Sister, do you understand what you're doing? Erina, so greedy. You got this much? - Erina, Suzuka-san, and all the others... - It couldn't be helped, right? There can only be one champion. Other people might as well die, right? Your sister had the center role abruptly stolen from her by a 14-year old. The agency said they were scouting you. Me? - Sister, I would never... - Don't even say it! The thought of one day hearing... "Oh, aren't you Sana Haitani's sister"? I was so terrified of that. If I'm going to lose out to Sana, then I'd rather be dead! Well then, shall we begin? Yes. Understood. This ended up exactly as you'd hoped, didn't it? And now for the grand final match. Sana Haitani-san versus her older sister, Sari Haitani-san! Sana Haitani-san, please accept your option card. Alright, this is the one. Sana Haitani-san, please set out a card. Well? I'm sorry, Sana. This all happened because you followed in my footsteps thinking you could be an idol. You don't have to be sorry. Card, set! Don't tell me, you're gonna lose for me on purpose? - So I can fulfill your dream for you? - That's not it! Ever since I was little... people have been saying to me "You're Sari Haitani's little sister". From the start, the only place I ever felt like I belonged was on stage. Because it's only when I'm on stage that people bothered to look at me. Sana? I want to become the Top Idol. Card, open! - This is... - Witch versus Glass slipper. Witch loses! The winner is number 8, Sana Haitani-san! Why? Why? Why? What the hell is Glass slipper? Glass slipper is an invincible card. You need 30 thousand points to purchase it. This is the first time it's ever been used in a real match. You can't! You can't! This is the audience answer. Check out the unstoppable popularity of your little-known little sister! No! No! Sister! Sister! No! No! I don't want to die! I don't want to die, damn it! Just one more time. Just one more time! Anyway, it's a lot of fun! I live for it! Standing on stage, everyone waving their glow sticks to the rhythm. Twinkling, beautiful, like stars glimmering in the sky. I think to myself "I was born to see this". I've spotted this year's winner! The champion of this year's Cinderella Game, Number 8, Sana Haitani! This year's Cinderella Game has gone down in history... as the greatest final showdown ever! Now then... Her sister's corpse! She's looking down upon her sister's corpse! Well then, Sana Haitani, please accept your trophy! Seems she's still shaken up from the final match. So, how about it? How does it feel to stand atop the corpse of your sister? Sana Haitani-san! Now, Sana Haitani-san, your trophy! How does it... Sana Haitani-san, tens of thousands of people are watching you right now. Cheering for you! So, of course... Of course you'd want to share a word for your fans. So, how about it, Sana Haitani-san? How does it feel to peer down while standing atop the corpses of so many? A word please, Sana Haitani-san! Just one strong word! A word now if you please. A comment from the champion! Well? Well? Well?! Please!
