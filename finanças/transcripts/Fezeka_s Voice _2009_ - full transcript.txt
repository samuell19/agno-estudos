[orchestra tuning] [audience chatting] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [woman in audience] Could you turn my phone off for me? Could you turn it off for me? [violin tuning] [flute playing] [audience chatting] [flute playing] [orchestra tuning continues] [woman] …so this is four bars before letter "A." [church bells] [wind chimes playing] [church bells continue] [trumpet playing softly] [orchestra playing] [background chatter in Xhosa] -[laughter] -[shouting] [singing in Xhosa] [boy 1 gasping] [boy 2 shouts] [Phumi] I've told the boys the important thing is to not hold back or try to copy the English style. We have worked hard to get here and a lot of money has been spent, so we should show we appreciate that. Now our work here has started and this is our work. Are we clear? [cymbal music plays] [Julie] When all this started, Phumi kept saying, "Hey, go and apply for your passport," and I thought, "It’s not going to happen." [Nokwanda] Is this really serious? Are we really going or… Oh, now I started to feel that, "Oh, I’m going to England." [Zukisa] The word flight was, flight, no, man, it’s not there. I am going to another country. No, it’s not happening, boss. It was my dream. [piano music playing] Altos this way! Sssh. [Julie] But when he got a letter inviting the choir, then I started thinking, "Hey, this is real. It’s happening." [applause] [piano music continues] [piano music ends] [African music playing] [honking] [chatter] [marimba music playing] [woman] All right. [woman speaks indistinctly] [woman] If I take less time than the other person to finish that job, then it means I’ve got more power than that person. Seven? Right, they say it’s the rate at which we’re done. It’s the time it takes for that job to be finished. [speaking Xhosa] That’s what makes a person more powerful or to have more power. [marimba music continues] [woman] Which lines did you utilize to calculate your gradients? A, B and…? BC. [woman 2] So, it is sexually transmitted, yes? How does this virus get transmitted? How do people get this virus? Are the people prepared to abstain? Why would you say no? Peer pressure? [speaking Xhosa] [sings] Come on, come on. [in Xhosa] You must time your own part, then sing… one, two… You're not concentrating, you're messing around. You missed your part last time. [organ playing] [singing] Okay. Tenor and alt. [upbeat music playing] [Phumi] We are one of the best choirs-- school-based choirs. If not the best. And a lot of the other choirs that are usually our second, third best, have had a stint abroad, and we have not, and then we’re beginning to wonder "What is this?" [singing] Wow! Ah! Whoa! [piano music playing] [Phumi] One, two, three. One, two… [singing] [Phumi laughs] Whatever! [screams] Okay. Let’s hear soprano and tenor one more time. [inspiring music playing] [Phumi] It's going to be a mammoth task, you know, it’s a tall ask. I have faith that they, yeah, it will all, it’ll turn out well in the end. [Phumi] You know, teaching is a very, very funny profession. I don’t think there’s any country where teachers are paid huge sums of money. I don’t think we’re here for that. ♪I went down to the river I sat down on the bank♪ ♪I tried to think, but couldn’t So I jumped in and sank♪ ♪I came up once and hollered♪ ♪I came up twice♪ [Phumi] Then there must be something in this profession of ours that actually keeps us attracted to it like a moth is attracted to the light. Even when we want to wander away, somehow there is a compelling force that keeps bringing us closer to the light. [inspiring music playing] There’s always a lot of chatting and counter-chatting, so the game is not necessarily only played on the field. The talking itself, as well, they score points. [laughs] [piano music playing] [choir singing] [students chattering] [Phumi] Just so that you have the idea. [in Xhosa] The plane leaves Cape Town and goes this way over the sea. The countries you'll be passing over, starting with Africa, are Namibia, Angola, Gabon, Ivory Coast Mauritania, Algeria, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Ireland. I’m told it’s very cold there and then… England. That’s where we’re going. [speaking Xhosa] England, UK. [choir singing] [Phumi] England, London, right, like Hollywood, USA, has a lot of glitz and glam that’s portrayed on TV. So, they have those ideas. They are expecting to find this world full of fun, fun, fun. [laughs] [choir singing] [Busi] It’s been a big dream for me because I’ve always dreamed to be like a movie star, shooting my movies in the Hollywood. I’m the star. But now to England, yeah. I’m also taking this one along. This is my favourite dress. [Zukisa] My earrings. In this century boys wear earrings. So, it’s not a crime. We just want to look cute. [Phumi] Just like I’d assume is the case with people who come here who have never been to Africa, I mean, I’m sure the pre-concept ideas would be that we are moving around half naked with animals and maybe having a lion as a pet on my backyard. You know, until a person then comes to Africa and experiences it, a person would never know what Africa is. I think I’ll allow them that space. I’m not going to spoil the fun. [choir singing] [phone rings] [Phumi] Hello, ma’am. Is that [inaudible]? I’m all right, ma’am. I cannot complain. Well, I’m lying, I can complain. My name is Phumi Tsewu. I am calling from Cape Town, Fezeka High School. Ma’am, I have a very serious crisis. I’m traveling with 77 kids to England. These two boys applied for their ID documents last year, but Home Affairs then told them that their documents had been water damaged. They needed to re-apply and… They did re-apply this year in January, but still don't have ID numbers, ma'am. Upon inquiring with Home Affairs, apparently these kids, the two of them, don’t have ID numbers. Immediately, if we can get them ID numbers or birth certificates only then will they be able to issue passports. [chatting] [phone rings] [choir singing] [Phumi] Music is a very strange, very, very strange language. It is used, I mean, we use it, for instance, as a tool to, not only to discipline children, but to get them away from trouble. In fact, we protect them against being exposed to gangsterism, to drugs, to… to alcohol abuse and so forth. [piano music playing] [Phumi] You have a lot of people that, in fact, young people that belong to gangs that are quite a threat to the prosperity of the township. These gangs infiltrate schools and you’d find the cliques also existing inside the schooling setting, yeah, which pose quite a serious challenge to the progress of the learners at school. [marimba music playing] [opera music playing] This is my favourite song from this opera. Inside it, it’s out and about to be a celebrity. This is me. "Teen talent Kaapse Jol. He wowed the judges with his operatic voice. Now Zukisa Nyaba, 16 years old, has his sights set on fame. And he's well on his way thanks to the Teen Talent Competition. The teenager who hails from New Cross Roads, Nyanga, made the top 10 in the competition which saw organizers bussing in contestants from the townships and Cape Flats. Zukisa's soaring voice left the judges speechless, 'You are a rough diamond,' gushed judge Mini Groove." I have a low self-esteem. That’s the problem. Sometimes I think of things that are the things that I’m not supposed to do. Like, sometimes I think I’m not a good person. Sometimes I think of killing myself or sometimes I think of… of… Well, I just have the anger and I don’t behave right at home and I'm cheeky and do unexpected stuff. That’s how I handle the pressure. So, I don’t like to be disappointed. [Phumi] It’s okay to be disappointed, Maizo. It’s actually okay to be disappointed. When we were growing up, we used to go to the ponds chasing wild ducks, especially the small ones. When you see it in the water, you feel like you can catch it, and you dive in the water. You see it floating on the water. It’s as if it’s blown away by the breeze. Right? But dive underneath and look at its little feet below the surface. The duck's feet are the busiest ever under the surface of the water. So, appear cool, but below the surface, work like mad. -[laughter] -Right? [kids playing and shouting] [choir singing opera] [Phumi] It’s quite strange how they’ve taken to Italian. They are able to sing music in Italian and German and they struggle to speak English, yeah? They struggle to speak Afrikaans. But, when they have music in those languages, in the languages of the opera, they handle that music. They are able, even able to memorize the music and, you know, get on stage and perform as if they are natives in the language. [orchestra playing] [opera music playing] [Nokwanda] My biggest dream is to be an opera singer like Pavarotti, you know? A famous opera singer, produce my own songs, you know, and be a professional. I want to go to university and study and get my degrees and my diplomas. The issue is a financial issue, you know, ‘cause the fees at the universities are much expensive. If that's not possible, I have to go and find a job ‘cause I can’t just sit around doing nothing. [chatter on radio] There’s this attitude that I don’t have money, so, why should I go, why should I go beyond boundaries because… um… because I was meant to not have money. I was meant to be poor because I’m black and I have to… therefore I have to stay there, down, not go beyond, yeah. [organ playing] [singing] [choir singing] Yeah, why didn’t you do that? One, two, three, four… [singing] [Phumi] Okay, tenor. [sings] I think the reason why they’re not moving any gear up is because the energy levels are quite low. They probably really get that from me. I may be leading in that regard. I’m dog tired, actually. Dog, dog tired. I’m just exhausted. [inspiring music playing] [Phumi] A slave pusher I am. I have to push them a little further than this limit that they seem to have reached now. [inspiring music playing] You're worried aren't you? Yeah, I am. [Phumi] …to travel with 77 children to Salisbury, England. All right. There are bumps. My contact at the national office, she is no longer working for the department of Home Affairs. [in Xhosa] We knew someone in the offices in Pretoria, she says she's no longer working for Home Affairs. We wanted to get the applications to her for fast tracking, especially their ID numbers because they need to check their fingerprints. Yeah, it would seem it's a slow process. [mocking silently] [Nokwanda] It might be crazy but yeah I’m so excited, especially when I’m packing. These are the shoes that we’re gonna be singing with. So, I bought some of them, and this is the tracksuit that Zuki and Tsewu bought me the other day. Yeah, I pack it first, so that I won’t leave it behind. [upbeat music] [Julie] Nokwanda spends most of her weekends at Phumi’s place. She sees a father in him. So, I think that is, he plays that father role in these learners. [chatter in store] [speaking Xhosa] [Zuki] Sometimes, um, one of them would, like, the other time he came here and he said he’s really worried that there’s one boy there that doesn’t have grey pants for school uniform and he feels that it’s affecting his confidence and performance in the choir as well. So, he was asking me if we could provide and buy pants for that boy and we did, you know? So, sometimes, yeah, I do as well become a mother, a mother to some of them. Not all of them. [piano music playing] [Busi] I'm singing opera today because of Mr. Teswu. He taught me such a lot of things. He plays such a big role to us. [Phumi] This is like my own little therapy. You know, I would have a very, very tiring day and when I go to the choir, when I go to see these kids, when I, when they start singing and they start to lighten up, you know, their little smiles affect me. I, in more cases than not, find myself smiling. [piano music playing] Everyone is ready for England. They can’t wait for the third. Yes, and also me. Can’t wait. I’m ready. Everything is ready. Yeah. I’m ready. [piano music playing] [Busi] The moment that I started singing in 2005 I was, like, thinking of my Mom. Maybe she will be here with me, listen to what I’m singing and see what her daughter is looking forward for. My Mom passed away in 2000, yeah. She had HIV, but she didn’t tell us that she got HIV. My mom was a secretive person. She only told her friends. [sad music playing] She left me with nothing, so my Grandmother was the one who was doing all the things for me. [Phumi] There are quite a few kids who are in the choir who lost their parents. There was one time that we buried two mothers, I think, two or three weeks apart. [slow music playing] [Julie] There are no more graves here. No more plots. People from Gugulethu have to go to Llanga to bury their people or they have to bury on top of the others. There are no more graves in Gugulethu. [piano music playing] [Nokwanda] My township is a township which challenges you to make your own decisions, you know? So, we have to choose which side we’re going to go to. You want to go to the wrong side or you want to… to go to the correct side, which you’re supposed to go to. [Phumi] These kids are born into a reality, a reality that’s-- that is a precipitation or remnant of the past. Take a child who’s born into a township where everybody around has a very low morale, a very low sense of worth and that rubs off to almost everybody around, to say that, look, umm, you can dream all you want, but at the end of the day you will end up like us. You are going to be in the same pit with us. [slow music playing] [speaking Xhosa] [organ playing] [choir singing] [Zukisa] Every day that I write in my diary, I first put God. I have a little prayer that I write. "God, thank you for everything and for the blessing that you gave me." In my space I write everything that I want to achieve in life. If I want to become a better person, what must I change? [singing] [Zukisa] "I want to become the best artist in the world." [Busi] I realized that acting was my passion when I was about 12 years, yes. I wanna be a movie star and… I am going to be a movie star. ♪Bad boys on their best behaviour♪ ♪There's something about you♪ [Nokwanda] I wanna be an inspirator to my community. I want people to look up to me. We have to have goals, like, we have to have vision. We have to dream. Like, I want to be a leader someday, you know, and lead my community. ♪You must be some kind of superstar♪ ♪'Cause you got all eyes on you No matter where you are♪ ♪You just make me want to play♪ I love that song. [traffic sounds] [opera music] One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One! [singing] We don’t chase the pace. You move. Think lighter. [in Xhosa] If you go there with an attitude like, "I'm going to nail everything I sing…" then it's not going to make any sense, you understand? We should be prepared now. We should sing well when we get there and Phumi shouldn't feel scared you might mess it up. Listen to what you have learnt today and photocopy it here. [inspiring music playing] [Peter] My name is Thobela, I am a tenor. I’m the soloist of the school. I have sung solos, many solos in competitions. I don’t want to talk much about England because I still have problems with passport. So, it’s in between. I don’t know whether I will go or not. [piano music playing] [woman] What are you going to do if you can't go? I don’t know what I’m going to do. [Phumi] I think everything about this trip is centered around the passport thing. The whole passport issue is just forcing itself to be an issue through and through. [in Xhosa] Do you have details of this boy's mother? Can you page Peter Ntshanyana over the intercom? Details like date of birth, ID number. Peter has all that. [announcement over loudspeaker in Xhosa] [announcer] Peter Ntshanyana, can you come to the office immediately? [suspenseful music] [in Xhosa] We need your mother's birth date. 1960. 10th of February. -The 10th… -Of February. Her name? -Deborah. -Deborah. Go find the teacher. He may have another question, run! [suspenseful music continues] 10, 02. [Peter] It was going to mean a lot because it was going to be my first time to go abroad in England ‘cause I’ve never been overseas before. Yeah, it means a lot. [tense music] [Phumi] I am going to travel with Peter and Zolla. I have faith. [tense music stops] The old man upstairs has not let me down so far. He’s not going to do that this time. [Peter] I just pretend there is no trip, but it's so painful because I may never get another chance to travel with my school mates. Only God knows if I will go or not. [woman singing] [Phumi] The first dream was a very little dream. I wanted my choir to sing with a full orchestra. And then we realized that. The second dream was to take the choir abroad, to one of the biggest, if not the biggest stage, in the world. and that does not come bigger than going to England, you know? So this, in my view, is a realization of that dream. [choir singing] [woman] Here we come, London. Here we come. Five days countdown. Five days. Five, four, three, two, one, blast off! [choir singing] [Phumi] A trip like this does even more. It says to them, "You are the best among the best." I mean, it’s an affirmation, you know, that you’re even worth going to England. You know, to such, and enter them in a big festival, an international festival. It’s a private number. Hello? Oh. From Pretoria, ma’am? Hallelujah. Yes. All right. All right. Can I quickly look for the document that has the reference numbers? Please hold. [shushing the children] I only have their birth dates, but somebody is going, has gone to quickly check for the reference numbers, ma’am. [suspenseful music plays] The other one that I’ve got here is 2809… 5803. Date of birth is 1989. The other one, the surname is [inaudible]. [suspenseful music plays] [in Xhosa] You know what? I can cancel this trip shit, I swear I can do that, I swear I can. Because one thing I'm not going to do is put my reputation on the line. Now, honestly. This is one bullshit that I'm not going to take, and this really is bullshit. I'm running around, wasting my time… There's me and Julie wasting our phone credit trying to make sure this trip is a success. On the one hand. Your little role is to be at rehearsal on time, I asked you nicely yesterday. [silence] And you two, where did you come from? What time is it now? 4:05 p.m. What the bloody hell are you coming here to do? Huh? [silence] Maybe you don’t realize this. You’re putting everybody’s reputation on the line here. [in Xhosa] What do you think we’re going there for, a holiday? [woman speaking Xhosa] [in Xhosa] We called you in here because time has run out. Yesterday, Phumi tried to call Home Affairs, but they are familiar with us, and nobody would talk to him. We can't sleep because of the stress from thinking we'll be leaving you both behind. Hopefully you understand that we tried our best, but it's out of our hands. We couldn't do anything. But, as I’m saying, you’re still part of the choir. I hope this is not going to break your spirit. You’ll be with us. You’ll be with us. We’ll come back. This is not the end. There can be another opportunity. [sad music playing] [Julie] You know, yesterday I was singing a song: ♪Let’s go, go, let’s go Let’s pack up our things and go♪ ♪We don’t know where we’re going But Lord, we must go♪ ♪Go, we must go♪ And I was thinking, "Hey, I’m going to England!" [Julie laughs] [upbeat music] Squash? I hereby inform you… [in Xhosa] you have been chosen to sing the third movement, Kyrie, in England as a soloist. [Julie] I had never thought I would ever cross the seas. And I’m very thankful, first to Phumi, because it’s all because of his work that we’ll be traveling to England. [speaking Xhosa] Ah! [man] I have 6:55. We see you’ve landed and we’ll see you shortly. [man] How you doing, all right? Good, welcome to London. Can you believe you’re here? Exhausted? -Quite exhausted, actually, yeah. -[man] You didn’t sleep on the flight? I couldn’t. I had to make sure that, you know, the plane is kept civil. Yeah. -[man laughs] -Well, they were quite excited. I mean, you could actually hear them going, "Ah" quietly, and then into a crescendo of, "Whoa," and then when it took off it was quite amazing. [singing] [inspirational music playing] Hi. [laughter] Hello, Amanda. Nice to see you. How are you? Are you very tired? Very, very tired. -Hello! -Nice to-- And you as well. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. -I’m Sue. Hi. -[man] I'm Francis. Who are you looking for? Jane Stamets? Oh, I don’t know. I’ve got four. Four boys. These four. [Phumi] Okay. He says you’re trouble. Do we have any younger sisters or brothers? -[woman] I’m afraid not. -They’re all grown up. All our little ones are grown up to big ones. You’re going to be our youngsters for the next two weeks. [Busi] Yeah, I can’t believe that I’m here. It’s been a long time. Cool trees, man. Wow. Wow! Wow! I’ve never seen a bathroom like this before. -Wow! -It’s cool. [woman] You’ll have to imagine that you’re on the river in Wimborne by the boys school and there’s a family of ducks going by with little chicks, like you just saw on the… We must do this every morning. [choir singing] [Busi] To me, England is like the same as South Africa. [boy] If you notice, there are old people in this area and everyone is cleaning his house. They are not asking someone to clean their house. Like, I’ve seen a lot of old people, like, 80s and 90s, cleaning their yards, shaving their grass, then I was like, in Cape Town by the time you turn 60 years you ask someone to come and clean for you, then you pay. Then, I’m like, "Oh, there’s a change here." In a place like this you can concentrate. There’s nothing you would not do that you told yourself you wanted to. [choir singing] [Helen] Hi, Lidiya? Hello, it’s Helen here. Lidiya, is Caroline there, please? Could I have a quick word with her? Well, the reason I’m running late is because I think I wasn’t quite assertive enough with the girls about the timing and they’re just being absolutely normal teenagers and taking ages to get ready. [piano music playing] [chatting] [suspenseful music playing] [applause] [silence] [choir singing] [audience cheers] [silence] [singing] [silence] [applause] [piano music playing] [piano music fades out] [birds tweeting] [Helen] Is the dustbin nearly full? [boy] Not yet. Would you like that bit of rhubarb fool that was left? Do you remember? [Zukisa] I would like to have that. -It’s sour. -It's sour? [woman] If you’ve finished that, go to the garden. We’ll show you what it looked like earlier. -[Zukisa] This is the rhubarb? -[woman] It’s rhubarb. -[Zukisa] This is it. -[woman] It needs quite a bit of sugar. -[Zukisa] Is it sour? -It’s very sour, yes. I’ll tell you what’s quite nice. We’ll go and wash that and I’ll put a bit of sugar in an egg cup… [boy] You can eat it when… You can eat it like this, yes. I’ll show you. No. No. It needs washing first and you need sugar with it because it’s very sour. [Zukisa] Do you have vegetables around this garden? Yeah. These are vegetables, look. Potatoes. In here I’ve got lettuces and rocket, but I’ve got it covered up to try and stop the rabbits pinching them. [Zukisa] The rabbits? That little animal? [woman] Yeah. That little thing with the long ears that was on the lawn. [piano music] [Zukisa] They’re hungry. They are thirsty, man. [woman] This is rhubarb. Try it. No, I… [boy] It’s sour? With sugar on it it’s not too bad. You probably won't like it though. -Cowards! -[boys laugh] When I was a little girl we used to do this all the time. I used to have… [Zukisa] Let me try. That’s nice. It’s not too bad, is it? [Zukisa] Try it. [opera music plays] [girls speaking Xhosa] [opera music continues] [speaking Xhosa] [opera music continues] [woman 2] When Priscilla and I were in communication before they arrived she asked me if she could call me Mum, which was wonderful. My instant reaction was to think "How lovely, how warm and how open." And so Priscilla’s calling me "Mum" and she’s calling Simon "Dad." But, of course, with that comes all the responsibilities of being a surrogate mother and having two additional children in our family. [piano music playing] [woman 2] I’m trying to be a Mummy to them, but a Mummy to a 15 year old, rather than to the child that she was when she lost her Mum, and I, sort of, I hope I’m getting it right. I hope I’m being warm enough and kind enough, but not so emotional that they find it difficult. [piano music playing] [newscast music playing] [TV newscaster] Hello, the latest news now from South Today, I’m Jo Kent. A South African activist, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, is the guest of honour in Salisbury this weekend. He was invited as part of celebrations for the city’s International Arts Festival and will also receive special recognition at Salisbury Cathedral. [joking and laughing] [Desmond Tutu] I remember what it meant when my family and I came for the first time to England in 1962… um… and apartheid was at its height then. To meet up with a London bobby, um, and say, "Excuse me, how do we get to such and such a place?" And the bobby says, "Well, ma’am…" Ma’am? "Well, sir…" It was such a novelty for us that long afterwards, even when we knew where we were going… [laughter] [Desmond Tutu] …we would go up to a bobby and say, "Excuse me, how do we get to such and such?", just to have them say, "Sir, you go that way." "Sir…" Ah, ah, ah! And what it did for us. For you who have never been unfree, you actually don’t know the awfulness of unfreedom when it gets to make you doubt that you’re a child of God. [piano music] You’ll be fantastic people. [Desmond Tutu] They’re all going to be incredible people. One day they will… they will be composers, they will be… they will be… heart specialists, they will be all kinds of things because you invested in them, because you had confidence in them, because you… trusted them. [woman laughing] [woman 3] And, you go one, two, three, up. [Nokwanda laughs] [Nokwanda laughing] [opera music playing] [singing] [choir sings] [Phumi] I sometimes worry about my enthusiasm to want to see them succeed, if I will not be putting a lot of pressure on them and they burn out and they don’t succeed or they don’t go to areas where they want to because they don’t want to disappoint me. [choir singing] [Phumi] But, it makes one very, very proud that from this trip that they are given an opportunity to change their lives around. They are also given an opportunity to, you know, to make an indelible mark in this whole world. [choir singing] [laughs] [silence] [Julie] Yesterday, as we were getting ready to start the day, one of the girls brought herself onto me and then it was Phumi’s wife. She told me that she’s got bad news. [suspenseful music] [Julie] She told me that Phumi’s son Tebogo had been killed the previous morning in a car accident. He was really shocked and he broke. He is acting like a man. He wants to be a man. He doesn’t want to show us how hurt he is, but I can see that he is hurt. [choir singing] [preacher] As the Kings Solomon would have said, there is a time for everything and a season for everything. There is a time to cry, there is a time to laugh. There’s a time for sadness and there’s a time for joy. That you can only take solace in that fact that as the sun has set upon us, as the sun has set upon Phumi and his family, but you know that tomorrow there is a morning in which the sun will definitely rise. The joy will definitely come in the morning. And for Tebogo we pray to God that his soul may rest in peace and we pray that God may give strength to Phumi and the family and we also want to say thank you very much, to God and to everybody else who has been of great support. We pray for all these things in Jesus name. Amen. [choir singing] [choir stops singing] [light music playing] [piano music playing] [Phumi singing] Stop. One, two, three and go. [choir singing] [singing] [speaking Xhosa] Little toddlers. [singing] They would probably be doing that. [singing] Come on, sound like high school girls. [Phumi singing] It might sound dirty. Yes, high school. One, two. One, all the tenor, bass, one, three, two and four… [singing] Soprano, alto, and tenor. You sing… [piano music playing] [chatting] [woman singing opera] [woman] Keep the focus in the… [singing] Right on top of it, right into the core of the sound. Keep it there. [student sings] [woman sings] Keep it there. [student sings] [piano music playing] [inaudible] [piano music playing] [Phumi] With kids you get kids that are coming from all walks of life. With our school choir in particular we’d even get kids that are troubled. That are victims to substance. That were part of gangs and they get sent to the choir. If you can get that one child get out of that quagmire, get that one kid who would even come to school… on an empty stomach… get them to achieve and get themselves out of that mire… I guess that’s my passion in life. Don’t do this. Let’s not do this. Stop. I can’t. [piano music playing] [Phumi] Yeah. If you can get that one kid to achieve and change his or her life around, you know, I would, as a person, have achieved. So, that’s… Yeah, I have to go to class now. [piano music playing] [piano music fades out] [choir singing] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
