AROUND 1860, ANTONIO VICENTE MENDES MACIEL... BEGAN HIS PILGRIMAGE THROUGH THE BRAZILIAN NORTHEAST. FOR 3 DECADES, HE PREACHED GOD 'S WORD, BUILT CHURCHES... AND REFORMED CEMETERIES. IN SPITE OF THE OPPOSITION BY THE CHURCH AND THE ELITE... HE GAINED ENORMOUS PROMINENCE AMONG THE COUNTRYFOLK. IN 1889, WHEN BRAZIL WAS PROCLAIMED A REPUBLIC... ANTONIO CONSELHEIRO REBELLED AGAINST THE IDEA. "THE BATTLE OF CANUDOS" HINTERLAND OF BAHIA - 1893 Toinho. Did you see that? Go fetch it. - Is that all, father? -There 's no point insisting, Zé. We must sell the cows. -100,000 reis. -It 's not enough. You 're the one who wants to sell them, I don 't need these cows. They're probably thin and bad for milking. Well, they're a bit thin, I've never seen such a drought. Well, then: "Better to be taken by God... ...than snatched by the devil." -You gave me just thirty. I'll give you the rest when I fetch the animals. - Citizens of Born Conselho! -Bye. Gather around to see the latest marvel from France and Germany. It 's neither a dream nor magic! Neither witchcraft nor sorcery! It 's an invisible wonder... ...called photography! -Don't move. - Firmino! -Please, absolute silence. Don't move! One, tun, three... and now! Had you ever seen one, miss? Why don't you give one to your daughter? -It 's a souvenir that never fades. -Let's go. - Look, father, it 's beautiful! -It 's called "photograph". - Buy me one. -The latest marvel in the world. - A miracle, for only 20,000 reis. -That's a lot of money. - A luxury for barons. -Barons are a thing of the past. - In a Republic, we 're all citizens. -It's the last plate. Fifteen. - Thirteen. That 's my final offer. -Let's go. Ten! Careful, don't move. Smile! Come on, Tereza. - Have you ever seen the sea, father? - Not yet... but they say it's a lot of water. Green like earth when it rains. And they say all types of big animals live in it... fish the size of cows, or bigger! - I 'd love to see it. -It doesn't have to be the sea. Just go to a big town, get out of this wilderness just for a day. - Will you take us, father? -We'll see. When I saw the portrait, I thought it was one of devil's tricks. Everyone inside, come on. One, tun, three... - I think two's enough. -You can 't take my cows! They're not even mine, they 're already promised. Sold, you mean. You've been paid, but haven't paid your debt. I didn't borrow money. I wouldn't be able to pay. - The drought took everything. -Flood or drought, it 's God's will. - God never took nothing from me. -No one 's taking anything from you. It 's income tax. It's the republican law. If you think this 's wrong, send a petition to the President. -It's stealing! -Don't call me a thief! Get away! This will teach you to respect authority! - Zé! -Take everything! - Right away, sir. -Let's go. - Who are these people, Zé? -lt's him. Good Jesus Conselheiro! Praised be Our Lord Jesus Christ. May the Lord's name be praised forever. Brother, may I serve your water to my people? "Blessed are those which do hunger and thirst after righteousness... for they shall be fulfilled. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. And those which are persecuted, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." Yes, brothers, you must obey the Church... and the commandments of God, our Savior... of whom I am a mere apostle on this land. He came to me one night and said: "Antonio, you shall walk through the backland... paying penance, preaching my Gospel... and the Holy Scriptures. You will be persecuted by evil men and by heretics... which you shall repay... by bestowing blessings wherever you pass. I will fill you with power on Earth. And you... and your followers... shall be full of grace in eternal life. Blessed be Our Lord Jesus Christ. May the good Lord be praised forever. - I got up before dawn -0h,Mary - To sweep the church of Conception -0h, Mary - I met Our lady -0h, Mary - With a flower in her hand -0h, Mary Father's strange, isn't he, mother? I've never seen him like this. Don't be silly, girl. He's just praying, can't you see? Who is this man? A priest? They say he's a saint. He looks more like Satan. I don't want to leave with that old man! I'm scared, Luiza. Look at us. I'll always be with you. Always. Where are we going, father? Now, our destiny is in the hands of the good Conselheiro. Your father has already decided, Luiza. Come on. Come on. I won 't go. I won't! I won 't! I won 't go! - Luiza, daughter! -I won 't go! No. You won 't tie me down. - Luiza! Wait for me! -You won't go. Conselheiro knows the right path, Penha. He wants me to pay him just because I sold a mat on his land. - Everyone must pay. It 's the law. -I won 't pay. - I sold it for 4 cents... -lt's unfair. ...why should I pay 100 réis? I won 't pay! Holy man! Give your faithful a good advice. - Tell them to pay their taxes. -Why pay someone... ...who has given them nothing? -That 's right! Why pay? You 're right! It 's fair that Brazilians disobey the laws of the Republic. Who overthrew Dom Pedro... denying him his divine right to rule over Brazil? It was the Anti-Christ Republic! Who introduced civil weddings outside the Church? It was the Anti-Christ Republic! - And taxes? Who invented them? -The Anti-Christ Republic! The Anti-Christ Republic! Didn't you hear what Good Conselheiro said? Throw that board away, man! - Throw way? But it's the law. -That's what the Republic is: imprisonment! Working only for the government. That 's right! It 's slavery, as it 's always been announced, that now comes to pass. Look at this old woman. She is white... and religious, it means slavery respects no one. But I believe... I nourish the hope that sooner or later... God will bring justice to bear. - The Republic will be demolished! -Praised be Our Lord! Well done, Join Abade! This isn't over. They will have to learn. My brothers. I have walked hundreds of miles through this no man's land. But our time for wandering is over. Here... in this land of Our Lord... I now found our Bela Monte Empire! Whoever wishes to stay, do so. But you'll have to work, pray... and live within the due limits. But be aware... persecution will follow me. First comes the deluge, and only then... the seed. When the soldiers of the Anti-Christ arrive... the waters of the rivers will be like milk to us, and blood to them! The dust of this ground will turn into flour for us... and into thorns for them! The bush will become sea... the sea will become bush. - Praised be Our Lord Jesus Christ! -May the Lord be praised forever! I said: there will be four fires. The first three are mine. The fourth... I put in the hands of Good Jesus! Blessed be Antonio Ditoso JUNE, 1893 Star of Spain Miraculous knight If I was to buy all your goods, brother Vilanova... what discount would you give me? A third, sir. So you may unload it. Praised be Jesus Christ, Our Lord. I don't want there to be lack of provisions for the people. Little Beato, invite that peddler to come live here. - He is not of our faith, my father. -But he's not Freemason... Republican or Protestant. I know him, he's a good man of his word. And he's a business man. We need him. Yes, father. Join Abade, organize a Catholic Guard here at Belo Monte. Yes, father. They'll dress in blue as it is Our Lady's mantle. Don't forget: one day, the troops will come. - They want your life, father. -My life belongs to God. But I must care for my people. Now we have a home, Penha. The bad times are over. With the protection of our father, things will improve. I've already chosen where to plant. We'll keep what we need. The rest will go to the Company. For the elderly and the crippled. Our good father will build a new church... and start a school for the children. Did you ever imagine Toinho... and Tereza would study? It won't be long before I can say I'm a happy man. -It was you who let Luiza go. -Me? I even ran after her. I called her again and again. That girl 's always been strange, Penha. She wanted from life what we couldn't give. And is misery worth resigning to? Luiza is dead to me. Where do you come from, miss? Far away. I've been walking in the bush for almost a month. You're like Conselheiro's people. Don 't mention that wretch to me! Why? Don't you like him either? How could I? Because of him, I left my family. - And now I'm here, cast out. -A lot of people are following him. - Even I thought of going. -You? But I gave up when I found out he doesn't like women. Or liquor. How about you? Do you like men? - She's yours, Baron. -Thank you, Rosa. OCTOBER, 18% Heave! Most of my farmhands left their jobs to follow that fanatic! There'll be no one left to look after my land. Not just your land. There are villages in Bahia and Sergipe... being deserted, everybody': going to Canudos. As if it was the promised land! A bunch of idiots. Have you heard what's going on in Juazeiro? No. Conselheiro ordered wood for the roof of the church they're building. The merchant was paid but hasn't delivered. Stroke a dog while he's eating. The fanatics announced they'll go fetch the timber themselves. But the judge didn't wait for more trouble... he has called in troops to invade this Belo Monte. I knew it would end in bloodshed. I hope you're right. Blood, plenty of those hoodlums' blood! - Attack! -Long live Belo Monte! Firmino, we'll stay here. You can unload. - Careful with the camera. -Alright! Pedro Martins, a journalist from Rio de Janeiro. - Mad. -And you, sir, who are you? Rogaciano Nogueira, Baron of Cocorobé. A member of the nobility. Then I have good news for you: Conselheiro 's monarchists defeated the republican troops in Uaué. The fight at Uaué is old history. The news is that Major Febrfinio de Brito left with 600 men... What? A new expedition has already left? By now, Conselheiro has already been arrested, or killed. - I was counting on going with them. -You wasted your time. - Aren't you that photographer? -Only in peaceful times. In times of war, he's a newspaper correspondent. Join Abade! - Praised be Our Lord Jesus Christ! -May the Lord be praised forever. We heard about Conselheiro 's victories and came to join you at Belo Monte. We've never touched guns. - But, if it 's his will... -It won 't be necessary. If you 'd like to make a donation to the Born Jesus Company... give silver and gold to brother Vilanova. You can get provisions... tools, seeds, whatever you like at his store. Except liquor. None of the devil's drink is allowed here. Pick a plot of land and build your houses. Me... -Y es? We killed people for the colonel. But we heard the Pilgrim's words... and are repentant. Now, we just want to fight for Conselheiro. We saw the troops coming this way with cannons and everything. I know. Brother, take these men and find Catholic Guard uniforms for them. Dona Rosa said you must leave. That this is no hotel. - How many days have I been here? -Four. It's fading. If you fix it, I'll pay you. I will. - When did I take this portrait? -Three years ago. - In the beginning of 93. -I had just arrived from Rio. There were those who thought I'd become Brazil's finest journalist. It can't be fixed, miss. And the troops? News of Major Febrfinio? He passed on his way back two days ago. Victorious? - A shamble. -lt's true. -600 soldiers couldn't defeat them? -We did all we could. - But they were a multitude. -And weapons? - Only courage. Wasn't it, Zé? -lt's true. They fought with scythes, clubs, rocks, only a few shotguns. Fearless of death, they charged us, almost begging for us to open fire. Then I ran out of bullets and realized... that's exactly what they wanted. If we spent all our ammunition... we'd be forced to retreat. And that's what happened. Those who ran, ran; those who didn't, died. But now they'll face Colonel Moreira César. The most gallant man in the Brazilian army. The "Beheader"? A round on me for the soldiers! Are you still in one piece? Or did they cut off your balls? Come on, Baron. I'm in one piece... ...and I'm hungry. -Did you like any of them? Choose, it's on me. You have good taste, young man. But beware... this one here is related to Conselheiro 's fighters. - Where did you get that idea? -I 'm just kidding. It 's just that she 's a warrior in bed. You didn't finish off those men, but you almost finished me off. You're very pretty. - Will you return to Canudos? -No. I'm tired of being a soldier. I have some land near here. I'll plant corn, raise a few goats. Have you lived here for long? - Three years. -If you like, I'll take you with me. Don't laugh, I'm serious. I would make you my wife right now. Well? Brothers! I came here persecuted, and the persecution continues! In this paper here, the demons of the Republic... say that our Bela Monte is a foreign conspiracy! That Europeans are training our people for war. A war which we did not start. They said we tried to invade other people's houses in Juazeiro. We never went there... but they came, with the ill will of taking away our homes. I said there would be four fires. There was the first... and they didn't get beyond Uaué. Then came the second... and the Lord 's hand again stopped them before the gates of Belo Monte. And now... a third fire will come! A Colonel... prince of demons, with a thousand demons... to destroy our home! They say that this man, torturer of souls... likes to cut off his enemy's heads... and that he gives no dead man a burial. Is this a man or the devil? He is the devil himself! The son of the devil! The father of the devil! Where are the people of this town? They deserted their homes, fearful of a battle here. - And you? -Pedro Martins, I'm a journalist. -I'd like to accompany your troops. -I cannot allow it! - Sir, shall we let the troops rest? -No, Colonel. We'll press on. - Colonel... - Let's go! Arimatéia! - I've never seen so many soldiers. -Damn. This time, there'll be no mercy. This morning, I heard the Colonel saying he's afraid, Luis. The "Beheader", afraid? I'm sorry, Captain Rocha... ...but I've seen him in battle. -Afraid they won't wait for him. Afraid of their fleeing before we arrive there. Ambush! Are they over there? - Come out, you scoundrels! -Get down! They've run away! This is the enemy's gun. A gun for killing little birds! These people are unarmed. Let's go! Let's go! Come on! - Cadet Luis da Gama, sir. -Luis da Gama. 23 years old... engineering student, and son of Senator Vicente Gama. Your father is a great politician. - I admire him very much. -Thank you, sir. You enlisted to take part in this great mission. - Correct? -Correct, sir. Well, listen carefully, young man. Not one of those soldiers out there knows what we came here for. Your father knows and I know. Tell me, what are we here for? Well, my young man, if you ask any soldier... even the officers... they'll say we came to fight Canudos and to kill Conselheiro. But do you know what I will do? I'm not going to kill him, I'm going to arrest him. I'll put Conselheiro in a cage and parade him throughout the hinterlands. And throughout the capital, to show people what monarchy is: madness! The monarchy is a repulsive old man infested with lice. I could kill him. I can kill whoever I like. In Santa Catarina, when I ended that rebellion, I killed 100 men. Over one hundred. In those days, people wanted... a reason, I gave them blood. Now, they want blood, and I'll give them a definitive reason... to bury monarchy! Antonio, Captain Rocha! - Your verdict, doctor? -Your condition is critical. If I had examined you earlier, wouldn't have let you come. - Perhaps you should go back. -Nonsense. I'm not afraid of dying, and I must get to Canudos before I die. - But your nerves, Colonel. -Don't worry, doctor. I don 't have any nerves. In my whole life... I have never felt any pain or any pleasure. Gentlemen, we'll keep up tomorrow 's plans. Reveille at four. Quick march to Canudos. We will rest the troops and then we will attack. - Are we all agreed? -Perfectly, sir. MARCH 3RD, 1897 There is our target: Canudos! Comrades! As you know, lam visibly ill. I have hardly eaten for days. But Canudos is very close. I will take it! Colonel, caution and chicken broth do no one any harm. As Napoleon said: "Armies march on their stomachs." - But conquer with their souls! -We should maintain your plan: let them eat, rest and then attack. Gentlemen, we'll have lunch in Canudos! Men! We'll take the village without firing a single shot! - Using only the bayonet! -Right! Let's get on with it! Forward march! On the double! Father, father! The soldiers! They want to invade Bela Monte! It's the third fire. Return to your homes. Trust in God and in the Catholic Guard. Praised be Our Lord Jesus Christ! Before sunrise... the demons will be returning the same way they came. Take your men and cover that side. Quickly! - We 're ready! -They 're fighting men-to-men. If we fire now, we'll put our men at risk. Come on, Penha! Take the children! Tereza, take the piglet! I won 't go! No one's taking my things! -I've been hit! -Come on, man! No, Toinho! Hurry, go get help or he'll die here! - Cavalry, move on. -Cavalry, move on! Come on! Food. I hope they make love as well as they cook. Let 's look for water, I'm thirsty. - Son of a devil! -Scoundrel! - Retreat! -Go, Pajeu! Come on! - Captain, where are you going? -Retreat! Well, commander... ...what are your orders? -I 'll encourage them! My horse! You shouldn't, sir. It 's too dangerous, Colonel. As I said earlier, I will lunch in Canudos. It's him! Calm down. The "Beheader" has a tough skin. To make him bleed, you need a sharp goat 's horn. Come back, cowards! - That's what I have here. -Go back, coward! Sir, Colonel Moreira César was injured. - He thought he was invulnerable. -You're in charge. - Me? Why me? -You 're the highest rank... Of course, I know that! But what am I to command? With exhausted, famished troops... he ordered the attack without studying the field! And now we are stuck here, unable to advance... and unable to retreat! What am I to command? -It will soon be dusk, Colonel. -What do you want me to do? Extend the day? - Tell them to retreat. -Yes, sir. Bugler! - You called me, father? -Did I allow you to make fire? - You didn't, father. -Very well... do you wish to be a soldier of the Good Jesus, brother? Yes, I do, father. Then fight... and you shall not die. - Praised be Our Lord. -Is this blood? -It's not mine. -We defeated them! - Not yet. -They ran away! No. They 're at Fazenda Velha. Tomorrow the battle continues. - I heard they got the "Beheader". -lt's true. Comrade Pajeu broke his spell. It is time for prayers. Come on, everyone. Let us pray. Thank God for today, and ask for victory tomorrow. I have called And l call again The sons of Christ To come and kiss me The sons of Christ To come and kiss me Hail Mary Full of grace The lord is with thee Blessed art thou The lord is with thee Blessed art thou I have called And I call again - Have we taken Canudos? -No, Commander. In the face of the situation, our losses, the enemy's resistance... we see no other option, but to retreat. Retreat? Why? - The men are exhausted, sir. -Soldiers obey their commanders. Where's the command that prevents them from honoring their uniforms? Shoot those who refuse to fight. Bastard. He knows he's dying and wants to take us all with him. Deserting would be... a stain on my honor. I could never allow that. Commander, we haven't come to consult you. We are informing you of our decision. In this case, I, Antonio Moreira César... herewith resign from the Brazilian Army. May my decision be duly recorded! May the responsibility for this cowardice be entirely yours. I have sinned l could not help it, lord Please,have mercy He's dead. Hurry, let's give these wretches a response! - Luis, go ask for reinforcements! -Right, Captain. Colonel! - The artillery is surrounded! -Play "charge"! - About turn, loud! Hurry! -They 're not obeying, sir! They can't disobey me, I'm their Commander. I gave an order! - Colonel Tamarindo has been hit! -Let's get out of here! Call Cunha Mains. - Luis. -He's dead, Antonio. - I must get back to my unit. -lt's no good... the artillery is lost. Let's go, Luis. Let's go! Pajeu, there's a lot of flour here. Get only the guns and ammunition. Burn the Anti-Christ 's food! Comrade Pajeu, look who's here. So, it's you, the great Moreira César! - Comrade, did you bring everything? -lt's incredible! There's a lot of guns. Pajeu. Did you get ammunition for the cannon? Aren't you asking too much? We got over five hundred rifles. Come on, put it in there. Now we are armed, my friend! Arimatéia! The soldiers! We'll get in anyway! - Open this door! -Open up! Open this door! Don 't get closer! - Have you gone mad? -Yes, sir. With hunger and thirst. We 're soldiers, not thieves! Get out of here. The second-lieutenant gave you an order. Obey it, soldier. You can put down your weapon. I've never seen such madness. An army, trained men, artillery... It just couldn't have happened. We underestimated Conselheiro's mob. Pride has killed many men. Pride and arrogance were our downfall. - But we'll go back there. -We'll rid Brazil of this filth! - Destroy that den! -Our mission here is greater. - They are Brazilian citizens too. -They're all nuts! Many of them probably are. But not others. It's the Republic's duty to rescue them from misery. Take the light of civilization beyond those borders. That's what the Republic is, ma'am: progress... well-being, happiness. Idealism. This failure will hit Rio like a bombshell. THE CATASTROPHE RIO DE JANEIRO, MONDAY, MARCH 8TH, 1897 Rio was in a state of chaos. H seemed like the end of the world. People smashed windows, beat journalists and set fire to monarchist newspapers. 10 soldiers lynched a newspaper owner... amidst cries of "Long live the Republic" and "Moreira César". JUNE 12TH, 1897 I didn't know he was so popular. I think people like murderers. You speak without thinking, that nearly destroyed your career. Thanks for the "nearly". So, in Rio, they're convinced that Canudos is a monarchist stronghold. -Isn't it? -I don 't know... and I've been here for three years. How can they be sure of that in Rio? I think the republican radicals are manipulating the public opinion. Why don't you tell the General your opinion? - He's right outside. Go on. -Is he the man to win this war? General Artur Oscar is a serious officer. A winner. - Gentlemen, are you comfortable? -Yes, General. Good. Haroldo... I want the journalists to be given all assistance in their work. I heard you are a photographer as well as a writer. Yes. In fact, battles have been recorded since 1860, General. Fenton in Crimea. Brandy in the American Civil War. And since 80... ...March 4th, to be precise... - Very good. - The nation must be well informed. -Then inform it. - Are the plans ready? -Yes. The first, second and third brigades form the column... that will march to Canudos through Rosario road. The fourth, fifth and sixth brigades form the second column... that 'll depart from Geremoabo to meet us at the gates of Canudos. On June 27th. Exactly. On the 27th we will defeat the enemy. - Remember me? -The fellow who says fancy words. - What are you doing here? -I 'm with my husband. - He enlisted in the battalion. -Arimatéia, right? I'll go with him. I cannot stay home alone. Many women will go, even children. It's common in our Army. I'll join you. Listening to you, anyone 'd think you 're macho, Firmino. Do you doubt it, then? I'm the best there is, do you hear? From Alagoas, like Marshal Floriano! A rod of iron! Tell me, has anyone felt it to see if it's really made of iron? - More than a thousand girls. -What nonsense! Arimatéia! So you decided to join the brave. If I didn't come, she would have left me. She wants to see Conselheiro dead more than any soldier. She's a true republican. I'm pleased to fight by your side. If you need anything, you can count on me. Excuse me. Mr. Luis... Lieutenant. Thank you. - I didn't like that. -Didn't like what? - Disturbing an officer. Really! -I didn't ask for anything. He came over because he wanted to. They say we'll be leaving for Canudos within three days. I'd rather go today. Don't say that. You don't know what war 's like. Before you know it, you 're walking hand in hand with the devil. What was our sin? Why the President of this republic... treats us like criminals? Father, was it the Republic that took Luiza? - Father, I'm going to fight too. -You will not. - I want to go, mother. -You won't go. Do as I tell you. You won 't go. I don 't want you to die. Didn't Conselheiro say that who fights for God doesn't die? Good Jesus needs people to defend Belo Monte. If Toinho wants to fight, he has my permission. Father? Was it the Republic that took Luiza away? Yes. The troops have split. Some are coming up the Rosario road... me rest, b'; ('Ana Bu': 'a. Let them come. They'll take another beating. And this time, we have real weapons. That scum should stay away from Bela Monte. We'll go to the hills and wait in ambush. When the mob appears, we'll attack... and finish those monkeys off with knives! Let's not waste the advantage of the trenches. - Should my men run from the fight? -Get them from afar. Shoot them! We have enough bullets. We're not scared of dying, comrade Vilanova. Lam night"... archangel Gabriel visited me in my dreams. He spoke of the fourth fire. He warned: "Whoever dies by cold steel... will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. But whoever falls by fire deserves everlasting peace." All my men have been soldiers. For each man, a war. But now I've changed. I'm with Solano, of Flores 's troop. I'll never leave him. {specially now. -Now what? I'm pregnant. But he doesn't know yet. If I had told him, he wouldn't let me come. And what about you, who's your man? He's with the 5th. He's up ahead with the cannon. I know. Your name is Luiza... ...and your man is Arimatéia. -Who told you? He did. I met him in Monte Santa, you're all he ever talks about. The most beautiful woman in the whole country, he said. He's a good man, Arimatéia. Margot... you've been in so many wars, tell me: the troops, when they win... what do they do with the people who've lost? - They kill them, if they can. -Women and children too? They don't usually kill them. Sometimes, they arrest them... or let them go. Do you think father will come home today, mother? He and Toinho have been in the bush for a week. The Republic's huntsmen are about to arrive. - I told him not to take the boy. -What if they kill father? We bury the body. The soul goes to heaven. Isn't that what good Conselheiro guaranteed? If they die by the knife, will they go to hell? Will they die, mother? Sons of bitches! It's Tamarindo. - You won 't take pictures of that. -What? Don 't take pictures. I forbid you. Didn't you say the nation needs to be informed? Yes. But not about everything. Who decides what the people may know? I do. Here in the field of operations, I decide. Put that stuff away. All of it! - I think this is all very odd. -What? I've never seen ammunition and food left behind unprotected. - If the bandits attack us now... - Lord save and protect us! For forty days and forty nights... Our Lord lived in the desert without any food. Nevertheless... no matter how unpleasant the hardships, they were necessary. Hunger! Thirst! Injustice! Pain! Death! Christ knows the merit of suffering because He, more than anyone... suffered. Open your hearts to the danger that threatens you! Do not fear the approaching hardships. In the name of Our Lord, Jesus Christ... defend our Belo Monte! They're coming. - At last, the bandit': hideout. -And on schedule. - I hope Savaget do his part. -lt doesn't look so frightening. - What's going on? -We're very tired. There'll be no rest until Canudos! Push! Come on! Come on! Soldiers... we will soon take revenge for our dear Moreira Cesar... Tamarindo... all our comrades! Sergeant, have the band play the anthem! Bring the flag! Platoon, at my command, fix bayonets! Place the cannon! At my command! - Bayonets! -Protect the right flank! Hurry! Permission for the left flank to fix bayonets. - Permission granted. -Follow me, men! Attack! Attack! Hurry! Let's go, son! This platoon is different, they're good. I killed him, father! I killed an Anti-Christ! No, you didn't. You didn't kill anyone. Let's get out of here. - Let's go! -They fled! We dislodged the attackers. We had losses, but we were victorious. And tomorrow, the 27th... we will enter Canudos. 0h,lord I have sinned lord,have mercy It 's an omen. A sign of bad luck. Especially in Conselheiro 's land. Don't be silly. It 's only an owl. Don't worry. JUNE 27TH - We are ready, General. -Very well. Let's wake these bandits up. Fire! Long live the Republic! Damn them! These scoundrels slept right beside us! Didn't I tell you? They're like ghosts. Shut your mouth and keep firing! We're running out of ammunition! We must save it! Damn! It's General Savaget. They'll enter Canudos before us. General, most batteries are running out of ammunition. It can't be, we have a wagon full of cartridges. - That 's the problem. The wagon. -What happened to the wagon? I'm blind! I'm blind! Come, boy, come! They're stealing the supplies! Toinho! Colonel, order the collection of guns and ammunition from the dead. Send a message to Savaget. Ask him to come to our rescue. But General, and the plan to attack on two flanks? Do as I command! The arrival of General Savaget saved the 1st Column from disaster. If it wasn't for him, the campaign would be irredeemably lost. More than 1,000 people were killed in combat yesterday. The situation is delicate. There's not much food and ammunition left. At a meeting, the Generals decided to wait for new supplies. Only after feeding the troops, they will attempt a new assault. We got more than 400,000 bullets and burnt all their provisions. - We lost less than fifty men. -lt was a great victory of faith... ...wasn't it, father? -No, it was not. The condemned republicans reached the gates of Belo Monte! They came, but they shall not leave! There, they shall be stung day and night... by wasps... and horseflies! They will blaspheme, cry, groan... and there shall be no consolation! And hunger and thirst will fall upon them... miserable dogs! You are doomed, damned blasphemers... who dared to attack the Lord's temple! The situation is intolerable. We don't attack and the longer we wait, the worst things get. Rations ran out today, tomorrow there will be nothing to eat. The field hospitals have nothing, no bandages or alcohol. But there's plenty of medicine for diseases that don't exist here. "Their impertinent shooting irritates us like flies... enrages us and impresses upon us a strange fear of death... that seems it'll come with the first bullet... A battle is much better than this mad shoot-out! Who's next? I'll speak to the General and get out of here as soon as possible. I've had enough. Poor Geraldo, he died without even knowing where the bullet came from. This is the work of that Lucena. He's the terror of the skirmish. Evil bandit! But one day we'll get him! This man's no bandit! He's my father. - What? -Lucena is my father 's name. And I've seen my brother among these thugs. Holy Mary! Why didn't you tell me your family lived there? - Are you thinking of going there? -No. Why did you want me to come, then? Because I hate Conselheiro. But I don 't want my family to die. Promise me you won 't kill my father, Arimatéia. Promise me! Luiza, we 're in the middle of a war! I don't know your father, and he doesn't know me. How can I promise you something like that? If we are to meet somewhere out there... God will choose who dies. My father was never a bandit. It's that old man that makes him do these things. It's the old man. Tempests rise in Mary's heart... destroy the "fireball"! It 's the "Slaughterer", but it 's along way off. Have you already eaten? Mother said she and I would only eat at night. What we have is for you and father, who are fighting the scum. I'm not hungry. Eat it. Are you going to waste it? Do you remember Luiza? - The way she was? Her face? -I think of her every day. - I think I saw her with the troops. -What? I think I saw her with the soldiers ' women. I'm not sure it was her. Maybe it wasn't. - What would she be doing with them? -I want to see Luiza too. They're attacking! They're attacking! - There's no man to fight me! -I 'll get you, you scoundrel! Praised be Our Lord Jesus Christ. Zé Lucena. - Is it about the boy? -Yes, father. - He 's left us. -By fire, or steel? I saw from afar... both. My wife and I, we're in great grief. Was his soul saved? He fought for God, to silence the black donkey of the Anti-Christ. He fought against fire, and died by fire. - His soul is in peace. -Praised be Our Lord Jesus Christ! May He be praised forever. Zé Lucena. Honor the cross that you carry on your chest. Yes, father. JULY 13TH Today, tomorrow, the day after... When will this bloody convoy arrive? - Maybe today, General. -I don 't want "maybes", Major! Until then, cut the troops 's rations and reduce those of the wounded. There's no more food, not even for the wounded. The supply to the field hospital was canceled yesterday. And you didn't tell me? It's the end! Son of a bitch! I was sure I would eat goat today. Aside his skin and bones, we 're left with less than five pounds. If we had more soldiers like you... ...people who know this region... - Well, Lieutenant... you outsiders don't know the region, but you're very brave. But even the women are brave here. Like yours. Left everything and came to this war. But that's not courage. That's love. Or stupidity. Only a stupid woman would want to be in this mess. I'm sorry, but I don't think that Luiza is stupid. - She's worthy. -That 's true. She is a good wife. When I saw Luiza for the first time... I felt something... burning inside, you know? I asked her to marry me right away. And she actually said "yes". I guess she liked me too, Lieutenant. She never gave me any reason for complaint. At least, not yet. She's so different from the women I've met. Luiza, your wife, is so sweet, so feminine. I'll tell you something a man doesn't tell anyone. Luiza used to be a whore. She used to be, but she's not anymore. I was tiptoeing, then I heard a noise... I turned around and there was Arimatéia... He scared the goat, the one I promised you. If we weren't in the middle of a war... I'd throw you down and fool around all night. And do you respect war? You don't do it because of the hunger. There's nothing left. I want to return to Monte Santa. - Is it the hunger? -lt's me. It's the Lieutenant, isn't it? It's many things. No, it's not. It 's the devil whispering in your ear. - The convoy is arriving! -The convoy! The convoy. I'm going to tell the General. The bastards want to starve us! That's what will happen, if we don't do anything. You 're a courageous man, Lieutenant. Will you come with me? No. War isn't just fighting. Well, Lieutenant, I think I was wrong about you. I'll show these hoodlums there's a real man here! Arimatéia, don't do it! Arimatéia got there. He got the first, the second... the third... I'll show them there's not just one real man here. There are two! Firmino! The convoy is coming! Today is the day that Canudos will surrender. The Colonel even ordered "cachaga" to be distributed to the troops. - To give them courage? -For me, it just drives off the cold. - And for you? -lt just makes me drunk. Big, isn't it? What 's wrong, Luiza? Have you lost your voice? - Have you already eaten? -Very well, at last. Arimatéia died to feed you. You and all the others. And no one had the courage to, at least, go fetch his body. We must think that tomorrow... Arimatéia and Firmino will be revenged. That for their lives, our troops will take ten. That's what we must think at a time like this. Maybe... but something odd crossed my mind just now. Something I didn't know whether I was dreaming or thinking. I imagined that there would be no attack. The General would call Conselheiro and talk to him. They'd reach an agreement and the war would be over. People would stop dying. Prepare for battle! JULY 18TH Fix bayonets! Form successive lines! March! As long as the church towers stand... Bela Monte resists. Descend upon us Divine light Descend upon us Divine light May love Illuminate our souls The love of Jesus My brave men, let us take Canudos! - Long live the Republic! -Long live the Republic! Take the camera to my tent. Forward, soldiers! There will be no cowardice! Let's go! - They're coming! -Wait for Lucena': whistle! Let us praise Our Good Jesus Only He can bear The weight of the holy cross - Come on! -Shit! Shit! They got me, got me, but they didn't kill me. - You 're wasting bullets, boy! -All right. Mother! They're coming this way! They're coming, mother! Go! Go! - Colonel Tupi has been wounded. -Take me to him immediately. Twenty-seven officers dead, forty wounded. The doctor is on his way, Colonel. - And men? -Hundreds were killed or wounded. But we have seized hundreds of houses. From a strategic point of view, we were successful. - Almost a casualty for each house. -So what? The troops took only a fifth of the houses. Nearly a thousand are out of action. How will those left seize the remaining four fifths? This is no time for interviews. We're in the middle of a battle. Get out. They'll shoot me, General. How am I supposed to get out? The same way you came in. From now on, I want to see all the articles he writes... all the pictures he takes. Nothing leaves without my authorization. Nothing! Now, back to business: let us consolidate our positions. - No one is to move. -May we take in the dead, General? Only at night. I'll write to the Minister asking for reinforcements. How many? About three thousand. - This will hurt. - At the hospital, a terrible plight. Indescribable. Upon seeing that moving and extraordinary situation... [understood Dante' s somber and prodigious genius. Only he could describe what I saw in that narrow... stuffy and hot tent. More gloomy than the deepest valley of hell. Blasphemy, sprinkled with tears, roared from mouths... along with the groans of pain and the harrowing death rattles. Let us leave that to fate, doctor. Don't do it, please. Neither fate nor destiny. If I don't cut it off today, you'll die tomorrow. Don 't let them, woman. I don 't want to be a cripple! I'd rather die! Don't let them! No husband of mine will die. And don't cry! Cut it off, doctor. - Do we carry on, Lieutenant? -With what? The artillery fire. Do we carry on? That's enough for today. It's hot, isn't it? -It must be even hotter down there. -A real hell. For them, even if everything was on fire, it'd still be paradise. - Do you want some, Lieutenant? -lt's good for the circulation. - Arimatéia was a good man. -He was my friend. - And Solano? How is he? -lmproving. Tomorrow he's coming back to our tent. - There 's a convoy leaving tomorrow. -I'll stay. Your husband gone, I thought nothing would keep you here. Does it make any difference? If I go or stay? Come here. When the war is over, I'll take you with me. - Where to? -Where to? To the big city. I'll make you a great woman. A lady! - I don't want any of that. -So what do you want? There was a time when I wanted to see the sea. We've already turned this hinterland into a sea... of blood. I already told you, I'll take you with me. Give me a kiss. - Go away. -Are you going to take all night? I'm sorry, Lieutenant, we didn't know it was you. There's no rush, I'll wait my turn. Calm down, Lieutenant! Calm down! Get lost! How much did he give you? Here, I'll pay the double. From now on, you'll only lie down with me. Do you understand? Keep your money. I don't need it. I'll lie down with whomever I like... and choose who pays. Come. 0ur spies said that 5,000 soldiers are coming from Monte Santa. Five thousand, I don't think we can hold out against so many. You have no faith, Vilanova. Five, ten thousand, it doesn't matter. With a wave of Conselheiro 's crook, earth will swallow up all of them. I believe in his leadership, not in miracles. And in this, Antonio Vilanova? And in this? Sure, as long as there's arms to handle it and bullets to shoot. Don't you worry, there is no shortage of ammunition here. - And men? -Every day we have fewer. The siege of Belo Monte is closing in, can't you see their plan? They no longer attack, they want to kill us of hunger and thirst. When an animal is cornered, Mr. Vilanova... it reacts with even more anger. Let's take back our homes! Come on! Let's show them! Come on! Let 's show this son of a... They got Join Abade! Retreat, people! General, did you censor the article I sent to my newspaper? This is outrageous! Your article dealt only with negative facts. - And false ones. -I wrote nothing false. On the contrary, I left out certain things. For example: I didn't mention that you employ one of the scum. Well, you should. It's an act of charity. - Do you remember what you wrote? -Of course. - Read it. -Why? Read! "The situation in Canudos has been unbearable for some time. The militia bullets cause the troops less damage than the promises... of Major Haroldo, who feverishly gripping the calculating pencil... with which he spreads general impatience, remains barren. Adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing... ...placing hunger in equations." -lt slanders an officer's honor. "Nevertheless, these provisions exist, and worse... have already been bought from Army suppliers. As they never arrive... they 're bought again, at high prices, food the soldiers will never eat. Is it fickle to raise suspicions about the fairness of these deals... given the fact that they involve large amounts of public funds?" You raise suspicions and make accusations without any proof. That's enough! Slander like this made the War Ministry interfere in my campaign. No one has ever questioned my honesty. I don't question your honesty. I question your competence. A soldier's competence is known in victory. - I never said you'd be defeated. -But you hope so. I just don 't think these peasants are a threat to the Republic. Even if they 're monarchists. They're Brazilians. - They are not! They 're fanatics! -As you are for the Republic. The same mad fanaticism. The difference is that you believe you 're on a holy crusade... while they 're just defending their invaded homes. You are very clever with words. But we won 't win with words... we will win with violence, the only thing they respect! The end of the war is near. But you will not be here... to see our victory. Gather your belongings. You'll leave with the wounded to Monte Santa. - This is an outrage. -Now get out of here! - I brought you this. -Won't you need it? We 're leaving tomorrow. I don't want to carry weight. Maybe I'll go too. - You have your reasons to stay. -No, I don't. - The Lieutenant. -He's just like the others. Maybe not. You need time to find out. It's a reason to stay. Good luck. Jurandir. Hey, Jurandir! Wake up, man. Let's go, Jurandir! Careful, sister, it 's dangerous to walk around here. "For I will take away the rejoicing of her great multitude... and her pride shall be turned into mourning. For fire shall come upon her from the Everlasting, long to endure. And she shall be inhabited by demons for along time. Oh, Jerusalem, look about thee toward the east... and behold the joy that cometh unto thee from God. For, thy sons are coming... whom thou sentest away... by the word of the Holy One... rejoicing in His glory. Put off, Jerusalem, the garment of mourning and affliction... and put on the comeliness and the splendor of that eternal glory... that cometh from God. Cast about thee a double garment of the righteousness... and set a diadem on thine head of the glory of the Everlasting. For thy name shall be called of God for ever... The peace of righteousness. Arise, oh, Jerusalem... and stand on high, look toward the east, and behold thy children... gathered from the west unto the east... by your word, rejoicing in the remembrance of God. They departed from thee on foot, and were led by their enemies... but God bringeth them unto thee as children of the kingdom. For God hath flatted every high hill... so that Israel may go safely... ...in the glory of God." -Praised be Our Lord Jesus Christ! May He be praised forever! - Mother. -lt's Luiza, mother. Luiza! Luiza, my daughter! Tereza! How I missed you! - Toinho saw you with the soldiers. -Praised be God... who, amidst all this sadness, brought back my daughter. And Toinho? Where is he? Did something happen to Toinho? - God took him to heaven. -The soldiers killed him, Luiza. - Damn! -Toinho is better off than we are. Tereza, go find your father. He must see Luiza too. You're so thin, mother. You look sick. There's not much food and what we have goes to those fighting. This sacrifice is in vain, mother. More soldiers are coming. - You won't hold out much longer. -We won't leave this place. - This is our home. -Look around you, mother. Look! There's only misery. Let's leave. I'm not a dog to be led back and forth. I made an effort to like this place. Was it for nothing? - Am I now to be left with nothing? -You'll have your life. Life is God's to give, and only He has the right to take it back. He also gave Belo Monte to all this people. - Only He can take it away. -They 'll kill everyone, mother. - Come with me, please. -Don 't be afraid, my daughter. The soldiers maybe strong, but God... - God didn't save Toinho! Match it. Ask God for forgiveness. God wanted Toinho with him. That 's why He took him. - God bless you, daughter. -Father! I missed you so much. I knew you 'd come home one day, daughter. Father, the soldiers will invade Canudos. They'll destroy everything, come with me. - Is that all you have to say? -Father. If that is all, then you can go back. Father, I know a way of getting out of here, the soldiers won't see us. A way. I know all the ways in and out of our Bela Monte. But we are staying here. Let me take mother, then. She's sick and starving. Tereza then, she's completely innocent. - My father was a good man. -And my daughter respected me. - Please, father. -Don 't call me "father" anymore. Wasn't Toinho enough? Between life and death, choose life, just once! Go away, girl! Do you know what will happen? The "Slaughterer" will destroy this miserable town. I'll be up there, looking down. And you know what? - I 'll enjoy it. -Don 't say that! And I'll enjoy seeing the soldiers cutting your throat... and sending you to hell, old fool! Because your madness destroyed our family. You killed Toinho... ...and will kill mother and Tereza! -Stop, Luiza! You can't make me any harm for you've done to me all the harm you could. Because of you, I became a whore. I went to live with the down-and-outs. But there are evils which bring good. Thanks to what I learned with the girls, I found a very good man. A soldier. But not just any soldier. My man is the soldier that fires the "Slaughterer". He's the one who will destroy Canudos! - You slut! -Stop it! - Don't do that, father! -Stop it! Finish the job off, kill me then, go on! Do not spill the blood of an innocent. - Forgive me, father. -Do not ask me for forgiveness. It was God's hand leading you. Just as He did with Abraham, He was also testing your faith. Now go and pray. - What about her? -She is free to choose. If she wishes, she may stay. But if she'd rather leave... she had better do so now. It's almost dawn. Sometimes it 's safer to walk in shadows than in sunshine. - I want to go. -Stay, Luiza. Let her go. Go, my daughter. If you wish to return, the gates of Belo Monte will be open to you. Today, God gave me the joy of a miracle. Jesus held my hand when I was about to kill my daughter. I have to tell you: I don't believe in miracles. - Neither God's, nor Conselheiro's. -Don 't say that, woman! - Don't say such a thing! -lt's true. I've kept that to myself all these years. I was always by your side, I never failed you for a minute. Now, I must tell you: I don't believe in miracles, but I did believe in Belo Monte. We came here and it wasn't bad. But I never forgot the daughter I lost. - She 's the one who renounced us. -It doesn't matter. She's my daughter. And I don't want to talk about this. I lost Luiza. Toinho's gone. Do you remember what I said to the officials who took our cows? That God had never taken anything of mine! And now was it God who took my son? No! I don't believe it was God. It was people! Flesh and blood! Those soldiers killed my boy. They shouldn't have. They couldn't have killed him! I don 't accept it, Zé, and can 't take it in. I'm angry- Very angry, Zé. And seeing Luiza made me think. Do you want to leave? Betray our good father Conselheiro? No. I want to stay. To get my revenge. They 're the first reinforcements. I'm sick of this damned war. I want to kill all those bastards and get out of this hellhole. My family has lots of money. I'm rich, you know? I could be in Rio now. Having a hot bath... some decent food, good wine... and then sleep in the arms of a real woman... dean... smelling of perfume. But no other woman compares to you, Luiza. When the reinforcements the General ordered arrive... we'll finish them right off... and then we'll go to Rio de Janeiro. - How was your journey, Colonel? -So calm... I thought the war was over. That I had come too late. Nonsense. A party always gets better towards the end. With your assistance, we'll bring down this monstrous citadel. I bring a message for you from the President. He requests the total destruction of Canudos. - No stone is to remain in place. -Very well. I sent for the "Slaughterer". It 's what they call the 32. Get your binoculars, you will see a fine spectacle. Timéteo, get down, lad! I can '1, it 's my duty. SEPTEMBER 6TH Praised be Our Lord Jesus Christ. May the Lord be praised forever. Conselheiro, the situation is difficult. The enemy have surrounded us. Cut off the roads, seized the trenches. We've run out of food and ammunition. You said that the fourth fire was in God's hands. God has decided: it's the end, father. It's the end. Or the beginning, one never knows. I have always been loyal to you, helped our cause. Even as a non-believer, I never betrayed you. Never, never. Come closer, Vilanova, I cannot hear you. I came to ask you permission to leave town with my family. Let me go, sir. So go on your journey, Vilanova. Leave now, I'd like to be alone. - Do we have everything? Let 's go. -Let's go. My friend... the fight is hopeless. Our Conselheiro is finished. Well, if he dies, I want to die too. Goodbye, my friend. Say goodbye to your wife from all of us. Let's go. When the sky Becomes the earth like a river With no fountain When the sword Pierces the stone When the sea Becomes a stream What unsatisfied passion What demented revenge Fallen holy virgin All-powerful Satan Amongst rivers lovely hills What nearby distance So many confident people In Antonio The Penitent "My people of Belo Monte. The time has come for me to say goodbye to all of you. " lord God SEPTEMBER 22ND {have sinned, lord What a shame that such a vivid sentiment... causes my soul to take this leave. In view of the benevolent... kind and affectionate way you have treated me... this put me greatly in your debt. Although I sometimes pronounced excessively harsh words... in fighting the damned Republic... re preaching vices and... in bringing the heart to holy fear and the love of God. I cannot believe, though, that I nurtured the slightest desire... to discredit your reputations. Goodbye, my people- Goodbye , birds. Goodbye Areas. Goodbye, fields. Accept my farewell... which well demonstrates the fond memories f II take of you... which will never vanish from the memory of this pilgrim... who strives eagerly for your salvation... and for the good of the Church." - Attack! -Come on! - Attention! Fire! -There, brother! (in! Crispim. - What? -Can you see it? - Yes. -Go fetch it. Go on! Come! Careful. See if it's working. Gunner Luis? Get all the guns. Leave nothing behind. They are too many! Take Tereza with you! Come on, mother! Run, sister! Take Tereza! I'm coming! - The enemy is here! -Go, girl! Let them come... but no one will take what is mine! Come on! OCTOBER 2ND What the hell is this? I better tell the General. Please, General, lam Antonio Beam... "Little Beato", and I came to give myself up... because we cannot stand anymore. - Good. And Conselheiro? -Our Good Conselheiro is in heaven. Yes, sir. In heaven. - Are the men willing to surrender? -I pleaded with them to come... but a lot of them won't surrender. They're very stubborn. But they can't stand it any longer, we 're nearly all dry with thirst. Very well. Your people are in no conditions to resist or to flee. Go back and tell the men to surrender. They will not die. I guarantee. And tell them the government of the Republic is good to all Brazilians. They can surrender, but I won 't grant the smallest concession. I give you an hour to surrender. One hour, and not a minute longer. New go. The general has guaranteed everyone 's life! Let 's go! Mane dee Joana! Where are you going, boy? Aren't you ashamed? A strong man like you? Surrender? I'll get you, you yellow dog! Where are you, Mané de Joana? Let's go. He's clever. Gives up his extra weight, in order to fight better. Give me strength, My Lord! So be it, my old man. Come here, boy! Do you know Tereza? -I'm hungry. -Come. Father! Father! Mother went with the troops! - She surrendered? -No, they arrested her. What about me? Wouldn't it be better for me to stay with mother? - Are there still many people there? -How will I know? I mind my own business. All women came of their own free will. Except this one. She was shooting men who wanted to surrender. - Why did you do that? -We were in our homes... ...and you came to kill us. -Are you married? So you want to know everything, great and small? - How extreme. -Did many fighters flee Canudos? Don 't bother asking so much, mister. You'll never get out of here alive, you're lost. You'll be like a blind man, stumbling around these hills. - How dare you? -Yes, we lost. But we still have to kill plenty of "scum"! Petulant woman! Show her the scrub! - Very good, sir! -Yes, sir. How do you wish to die? Shot Luis. I need you. - They're gonna kill her! -Who? Talk to the General, beg for my mother's life! Your mother? What is she doing here? They'll give her a"red tie". - Let each look after his own dead. -My mother is alive! Do something for her! Please! For me. We are at war, Luiza. Your mother 's on one side... I'm on the other. Salute the Republic, witch! Long live Bela Monte! Long live... - Have you seen Luiza? -I saw her a while back. She seemed crazy. Throw me one, Lucena. - Get ready, the scum is back! -Give them hell, Mr. Lucena! Give them hell! - Give them hell! -Let 's bring those bastards out. With dynamite! With fire! Burn Canudos! Burn it all! Fire! Let them have it! Get out of the way, fool! Come on! Burn them! Go. quick! Tereza! Descend upon us Divine light Luiza! Illuminate our souls With the love of Jesus - Tereza! -l'm scared, Luiza! Don 't be, I'm here with you. Let's go. Cover me, I'll ferret out some scum! Lucena, I'm telling you. I'm an ex-slave. I was chained up for almost fifty years. I was freed twice. The first time, by Princess Isabel... the second, by my good father Conselheiro. And now, this will be the third. Because God will come and take me away from this misery. I'll go in peace. And I want to say, my friend... that this is the happiest day of my life. The four of us, here, showing that scum... that there are men they can't break. That men aren't like cattle. That we're not afraid of their shouts or of their whip. My heart asked me to fight and I fought. My good father Conselheiro brought me to the gates of heaven. I can only be grateful. - Praised be Our Lord Jesus Christ! -May His name be praised forever. Come on, my friend. Let's go. OCTOBER 5TH, 1897 How are you, General? Would you like some coffee? Thank you, I'm anxious to get home. After all, it 's been six months... in this wilderness. Six months! Well, well. It's our journalist. So the nightmare is really over, General? Sergeant! Show them. You disgrace the army, General. Your campaign was a crime. We won! Luis said that the Republic would do so much good. But in the end, the dynamite he held was to be thrown at me. Is that the good of the Republic? The good he said he would give me... was that it? - Come on, let's go. -Where to? - We 'll find some place. Let 's go. -Luiza... will you pray with me? "Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed an thou amongst women... and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God... pray for us sinners... now and at the hour of our death." Amen.
