He has not come yet. [INDISTINCT VOICES] 'Why is she here?' What is she doing here? Buchi Reddy, why has she come here? Isn't she Rami Reddy's daughter? - Greetings, brother Hope you are fine? - Greetings. Please have coffee. - He is inside. He will come now. - Okay, madam. Come, dear. What is the matter? Tell me, dear. - I want to meet brother. - Is that so? - Veerappa. - Madam. Take her to meet my husband. - Please come. - Go, dear. I'll enquire and let you know tomorrow. - You go now. - Brother, Rami Reddy's daughter. - Greetings. - Greetings. - She wants to meet brother. - Please come. [CROWD MURMURING] Rami Reddy's daughter Sucharitha is here to speak with you. Please sit. Brother, someone murdered my father. My husband has been imprisoned. They are threatening to kill me if I enter our town. I'm very frightened, brother. High Command is giving my father's seat in the By-election to his murderer! You should be scared only if I'm dead. Why do you worry when I'm alive? Get your nomination papers in order. That seat is yours. I'll take care of anyone who opposes it. Hey, Obulesu. Sir. - Drop Charitha madam in her house. - Sure, sir. - I'll take leave, brother. - Alright. Election is round the corner in a year's time. Why should we get involved now? Brother, when her father was alive, he always wished the worst for us. Why should we help his daughter, brother? Why talk politics to a lady who stepped into our house asking for help? [VEHICLE ARRIVING] [METAL CLANKS] Driver, stop the vehicle. Sister, you don't worry I'll take care. You keep going. No need, Obulesu Ask him to stop the vehicle. Sister, be brave Don't get tense. Press the accelerator. Hey! Speed up. Maintain the same speed. Hey, remove the stones. - What happened, bro? - Remove the stones. Give them way. Let them pass. Why are you looking like that? Stop the jeep. Uff! What are you doing in this hot sun? Go home, eat and sleep. - Bro, let me kill him. - Hey Keshava! Wait. - Hey go, go. - I'll finish him off. Start the jeep. Why should we be scared of that scrawny fellow? I could have easily hacked him to death. - Hey! Stop. - Hey! That jeep belongs to Rajasekhar Reddy. It is as same as blocking him if we had stopped it. Even a small scratch on it is a scar on his body. We will be blamed if this jeep had stopped in our area or met with an accident, or struck by a thunder bolt. Pray to God that nothing should happen to that jeep and she should go home safely. He wants to chop my foot! Aargh! [TYRES SCREECHING] - Raja. - Yes. High Command has come to know that we are supporting Sucharitha. He has come from Delhi to meet you. Greetings Greetings sir. - How are you? - I'm fine... I'm fine. Mr. Reddy. This is confidential matter. I want to speak only with you. [FOOTSTEPS LEAVING] I think you didn't hear me. I want to speak with him in private. I heard you. You are now speaking only with one person. Hmm... okay. Let's come to the point then. In the coming By-elections, high Command has confirmed a seat to Mr. Subba Reddy. It has been a long standing practice in that constituency, for only Sucharitha's family to contest, How is it if you deny them a seat now and offer it to their enemy? Only after giving it a lot of thought High Command took this decision. Ask Sucharitha to withdraw from the contest. Not possible. I've given my word. Mr. Reddy. Before giving your word you should've thought about it. I will think before giving my word. But why think after giving my word? I must take it forward. This is High Command's order. Not only should you lend your support to the nominated candidate. But also campaign and ensure the candidate wins! Let us know your decision by tomorrow. Respected sir. I don't know if you'll see tomorrow dawn or not. Getting old, right? Better to be ahead in this age! Why wait until tomorrow? I'll tell you my decision today, listen. I will not support Subba Reddy. Sucharitha will not withdraw. Okay. Good luck! Long live YSR... Long live YSR... Long live YSR... Long live YSR... [CAMERA CLICKS] Why are you supporting your enemy's daughter Sucharitha? Long live YSR... Long live YSR... [PHONE RINGING] Where are you? I'm close by I'm coming. Thank you, sir. Everything is all right. - Thank you. - Welcome. You please go home. I'll handle one more nomination and come. Only 30 minutes left for filing the nomination. Please ask your candidate to come soon. [PHONE RINGING] Time's up for nomination. For this by-election... since Sucharitha is the only candidate who has filed her nomination. She will be declared as elected. 'Long live YSR' Why are you so late, Subba Reddy? Have I come at the right time, sir? Long live YSR... Long live YSR... Long live YSR... Long live YSR... Come, brother Please sit. - Bring 1 more coffee. - Yes, madam. High Command is very upset with this by-election incident, Raja. They've issued a show cause notice. You must explain to the disciplinary committee it seems. You have to go to Hyderabad. [PAPER RUSTLES] Greetings, sir. - Suri, where are those papers? - Here it is brother. [ENGINE STARTS] Give me. Brother. They've filed some cases against our Venkat Reddy and imprisoned him. - I'll meet Venkat Reddy and then leave. - No. Our party's seniors are waiting for you You may get delayed again. Party volunteers get priority only then the seniors follow. Let them wait. Haven't we waited ever so often? Sir, time is up. How much longer should we wait? Did you inform the meeting time clearly? Have already informed, sir. Maybe his watch shows a different time! He's already 1 hour late! Yes. - Find out if he's coming or not. - Find out. [CROWD MURMURING] [CAMERA CLICKS] - Sir... Sir, one second. - Wait. Sir, when you've been a responsible opposition leader... how is it right to meet a criminal in jail? He's only facing allegations [CAMERA CLICKS] It hasn't been proved as yet he's a criminal. But he is the main accused in this case. Are you saying this isn't a way of encouraging political killings? [CAMERA CLICKS] I went to meet my party worker. How's that a crime? I've never endorsed murder to solve a political issue nor will I encourage it. Sir, even if you refute, there is a whole load of charges against you. In 1993 it's alleged you instigated communal riots to acquire the CM's post. You were responsible for hundreds of innocent people dying, there's a strong allegation against you. [HONKING] For a mere post... you are claiming I killed so many innocent lives. Does your question make any sense, madam? If I had wanted that position so badly.., then isn't it easier for me to kill that 1 person who put a spoke in the wheel? Why would I burden my conscience with countless deaths? Those cases were allegations with no evidence, our Court quashed those cases long ago. [CAMERA CLICKS] Sir, one last question... Please sir... Sir... Sir... - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir. Greetings, sir. - Srinivas, how are you? - Good, sir. Greetings, brother. - Venkatramana, how are you? - I am good, sir. When did you come, Reddy? [FOOTSTEPS ARRIVING] Greetings, sir. - How are you, grandpa? - Fine, sir. Is your hearing better after surgery? - Very good, sir. - What is this? - Mr. Reddy. - Yes. This is very shameful. High Command is very disappointed with you. Because of your mediation our party's integrity is gone. If you want to defend yourself, go ahead... Hey, keep quiet. Reddy. I was right there. We know you are responsible for it. I can't lie. I was responsible for Subba Reddy withdrawing his nomination. Oh...! So is this what you want to tell the High Command? Yes. In addition to that inform them I have 40 MLAs, 12 members of the Parliament and 30 MLCs are supporting me. They will be fully aware what action to take against me. Mr. Tiwari, think and let me know tomorrow morning, what action the High Command intends taking. I'll take leave. Only with your support he has come this far! He seems least bothered about High Command too. What's my support? You don't know YSR's strength. High Command has no idea whatsoever! [MUSIC] MANA DESAM PARTY [CROWD MURMURING] Our leader is thinking about advancing this election. He wishes to know your viewpoint regarding that. Along with Hitech city and flyovers which we built, our popularity has increased thanks to our 'Janmabhoomi'. Compared to the last election, this will be a bumper majority for us. We still have plenty of time. Why rush now? Survey of public sentiment is also in our favor. On top of it opposition is very weak. Those surveys are always like that. They will favor whichever party is in power. Farmers and teachers are very furious. Then I leave it to you. So what if they are reacting emotionally? If we promise 2 or 3 freebies all this will vanish. You'll turn a deaf ear to whatever I say. If we promise an increase in quash loans for farmers, free electricity and allowances for teachers then we shall get their votes with ease. Yes. No, kindly listen to me. History says so. Mr. Ranga Rao. Forget history and paranoia. If all of you are fine... I'll inform our decision to our leader. If Big Boss has already decided, how will our words hold sway? Famous for his one track mind. We have no choice but to follow him. Mr Naidu, what do you think? What can I say? Nod my head, that's all. E TV News. In the state politics, party in power has restrained all other parties. The party has announced elections to be conducted earlier. [PHONE RINGING CONTINUOSLY] CM will give a letter to the Governor asking him to cancel the assembly. In such a scenario leaders of the party in power, based on the trust and reverence promised by the people. A sure shot victory in this election. Being prepared for elections and aware the scales are tilted in their favor, important leaders of the ruling party have informed the Press & Media. Long live Congress... Long live Congress... Long live Congress... Long live Congress... Welcome, sir. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. 'Long live Congress' We are very happy that you have taken the party in-charge position. Sir, he's Mr Venkat Rao. Big industrialist. Sir, he's trying for the Kadiri's seat. Yes... Yes... Yes... I know his father. Sir, along with the party funds... he'll take care of the expenses in that constituency. Please recommend him strongly to the High Command, sir. I'll speak to the High Command - and then I'll confirm. - Thank you, sir. Please think about it before confirming, sir. That's Narayana Reddy's seat. So what? He's YSR's candidate. So what if he's YSR candidate? No one is bigger than the party. In our party High Command's decision is final! I know very well how to persuade or dissuade the concerned person. - I will tell him. - Okay, sir. Mr. Venkat Rao. Take it from me. Your seat is confirmed. Thank you, sir. When you've come in person, why this envelope? Tell me what is in this envelope. He's Venkat Rao. High Command has selected him as party in-charge for Anantapur district. Party has also decided to make him stand as MLA candidate for Kadiri constituency. Isn't it brother Narayana Reddy's seat? Then what about him? He has lost twice, Reddy. He's also very weak financially. He will find it tough to even spend for his seat. I don't think he's useful to our party anymore. Connect the call to brother Narayana Reddy. He's right here, brother. - Ask him to come in. - Okay, brother. Please come in brother. Brother, please come. How are you? Why did you have to come all the way in this hot sun? - How are you, Raja? - Good, brother. Please sit. Not here, brother. Please sit there. - It's okay. - Please come and sit there. Come, brother. - Greetings. - Greetings. In the next election, if he loses what should we do? Shall we look for another person? If you keep searching how many candidates will you sift? Remove my name too if brother Narayana Reddy's name is not in the list. Reddy, this decision was taken by High Command. So, you have to obey party orders. Don't mistake my humility and loyalty as weakness. Didn't you always claim you followed party rules, Reddy? Is this how you respect the High Command? There's a huge difference between loyalty and servitude. I'm loyal to my party but I am not a slave! You don't seem to understand that. What is this, Raja? He does not understand how our party works. Inspite of being here for so many years, he doesn't understand our party discipline and procedure. You are right, otherwise he would've become CM long back. Even without any portfolio he doesn't listen to anyone. If he's given a post, he will set fire to the High Command, sir. I know our party, procedure and discipline Am I not there for you? Recommend me. It doesn't matter if a CM is elected from our group. But he should not be selected, sir. [CICADAS CRITTER] [CLOCK RINGS] We are not really prepared. Since our party is not in power, we can't expect heavy support from the High Command. But then, what is their situation? If you weigh the pros & cons the ruling party looks stronger than us. They are well prepared, Raja. And also their Press & Media favor them. It's a major plus for them. They might win in this present situation. If we are defeated this time too. This will be our last election. Then we may have to sit at home and play with our children and grandchildren. We don't have support, affordability and strength at least to put up a tough fight. What do we do then? Quit politics, huh? Capstan, I'm scared for the first time. I'm scared that my father's dreams may end up as mere dreams. Like those who can't succeed... we may end up as remnants of history. Sometimes... we must reconcile to whatever we are destined for, Raja. Think thoroughly and take a decision. [THUNDERS] [CROWD MURMURING] - Greetings sir. - Greetings. Mr Venkatappa, - he is my 2nd son Rajasekhara Reddy. - Oh! From today, he will stay with you. You are his father, teacher and his whole world. In addition to studies teach him the values of leadership. - Make him a good leader. - Oh. I've seen parents wanting their sons to become doctors and engineers. But for the first time in my life, I'm meeting a father who wants his son to become a political leader. Engineer or a doctor will be useful for 1000 or 100000 people. But a political leader can help 10 million people at a stroke. Make him a good leader who will never go back on his word. Whether life and power exist or not... make him a leader who will stay in the hearts of people forever. Make him a leader who will stay in the hearts of people forever Dad, politics and portfolios are not greater than our ambition. But my ambition might remain as a ray of hope. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [THUNDERING] Forgive me, dad. [THUNDERING] [RAINING] "Along with my people" "Shall I go forward now" Greetings sir. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir. "Not knowing why, woebegone" "Shall I stand by myself all alone?" "Not seeing any shore to safety" "Shall I stop swimming in mid sea" "Shall I turn into a question," [ENGINE STARTS] "which got no solution?" [INDISTINCT VOICES] "Along with my people" [INDISTINCT VOICES] "Shall I go forward now" [ENGINE STARTS] [INDISTINCT VOICES] "Not knowing why, woebegone" "Shall I stand by myself all alone?" Greetings, sir. Take cover under that tree. You won't get wet then. "Along with my people" "Shall I go forward now" "When everyone looking at you" with unlimited hope and love" "Every single minute as your shadow" "they follow you faithfully too" "Shouldn't you be the one to cross over" "the threshold of life in their favor?" "Shouldn't you complete your yatra ahead" "with confidence as your path to tread?" [RAINING] Whether it is political war or for sainthood, I am answerable only to three people. My father who gave birth and a goal to me. My teacher who inculcated education along with values in me. Trusting me for 30 years and electing me as your leader who has never seen defeat. The election to be held in a year, has been advanced. Forget about winning, even to give a tough fight... we don't have support, affordability and strength. What shall we do? Shall we quit politics? No, brother You should not - No, brother. - No, brother. - No, brother. - No, brother. Some have water to survive. Some have resources. Some have their own business. What do the people of Rayalaseema have, brother? Is it wrong to be sensitive and stubborn? What can we do, brother? Except protesting or entering politics? We sow seeds inside rocks and wait for plants to grow, we belong to such an optimistic clan. Do we give up agriculture because it doesn't rains? How can we give up politics scared we might lose? Brother, we had immense faith in you and firmly believed that you'll somehow help us. Now if you say you want to quit what can we do, brother? Long live YSR... Long live YSR... Long live YSR... Long live YSR... - Greetings, brother. - Greetings, brother. - Greetings, brother. - Greetings, brother. Greetings, brother. In these 30 years of my political career... we have seen many elections and held group politics. Inspite of these experiences we did not get the position we wanted. Do you know why? We thought votes can be lured by the clap of hands, being part of cliques can win a position of power and protests can win titles. We figured out whatever we needed as a leader but, we failed to understand what people needed. I feel like knowing their wants. I feel like hearing their wishes. I feel like visiting every household beyond this Kadapa town. I feel like walking with them. I feel like listening to their heartbeats. If I win they will say it's my stubborn streak. If I lose they will claim it is my foolishness. Whether this journey by foot is considered stubborn or stupid let history decide. Long live YSR... Long live YSR... You are walking in the peak of summer. Can't you do this yatra a month later when it is less hot? - Where is brother? - Is this summer new to us? This heat won't harm me. [FOOTSTEPS ARRIVING] How are you, my dear? - I am fine, brother. - Come, sit down. - Have breakfast. - I already did, brother. - Everyone is waiting. - Oh. Greetings, brother. - Greetings, brother. - Greetings, brother. - Greetings, sir. - Capstan, what's the plan? Route map is ready, Raja. I have a couple of options. We feel it will be better to start from Tandur. Brother, start from Tandur. That sounds like a plan. I'll arrange a public meeting on the way at Chevella. Come, brother. Why start from Tandur? We can start from Chevella We'll start from Sabithamma's house. - No, brother. - Why? Widows are considered inauspicious in our society. You are leaving for a good cause. No need to start from my house, brother. Auspicious time is required only for stealing. Why worry about it when the cause is noble? A good heart will do. We shall start from Chevella. Hello, Khader. I have got all the vehicles ready for your yatra, brother. - Let me know how much. - Money isn't an issue, brother. I want you to win. I'm there for you whatever you need. We will also come with you, brother. [CICADAS CRITTER] How much longer is this political stint? You want to go on a yatra with him. We don't even know if he will win. Even if he wins how will we benefit? Instead of following him blindly if we believe in the land we own... we are at least assured of our daily food. Think about it once, dear. Gain or loss, I don't even know if he will win or not. But I trust our Reddy I have worked with many leaders. When I go for duty in the morning, they will ask me to have lunch and come. But only Reddy will treat me as his equal, ask me to wash up, join him for lunch and set out together. I trust Reddy, dear. Firm faith. - Greetings, sir. - Tell me, Mr. KVP. Mr. YSR wants to set out on a journey by foot. We need the High Command's permission, sir. Yatra by foot? From when? From tomorrow, we are making all the arrangements. Why do you approach in the last minute? Ours is a national party You have to follow rules. Initially send your plan proposal to your State Working Committee. They will discuss with the President of PCC and forward it to CWC. And then the High Command will look into it. -Oh.-Is that clear? Right, sir. Uff! What did he say, Capstan? It is a national party it seems. He has rules to follow it seems. First state CWC should propose and then president of PCC will examine. Understood. Let them do what they can. We'll do what we can. "Like a furnace in your eyes adorn" "A dream waiting to dawn" - "Let it emerge as truth honestly" - Long live YSR... Long live YSR... - "Like the search for light earnestly" - Long live YSR... Long live YSR... "This pre-dawn auspicious song welcomes you and your yatra along" "Won't this golden painting," "display your goal this morning?" "Our war isn't anywhere outside, dude" "You soul has become your battle ground" "Life is chasing like an arrow" "It is asking you to win against yourself" "These words echo within softly Like the sun scorching the mind intensely" "Let the flame ignite God's will positively" "Like a snow capped mountain in your heart" "Let confidence settle daily never to part" "Without saluting mother earth humbly" "Will the flag of victory fly in the sky indisputably" "Without ambition flowing like blood duly" "Will every breath verily like a conch, call for war truly?" Grandmas and grandpas, how are you? We are fine, sir. Are you receiving your pensions? We don't get, sir. All those getting pensions, lift your hands. - What is this? - Er... budget problem, sir. According to Govt order only 10 persons in every village will be paid Rs 75 Has the Govt allotted to only 10 persons? Can't you see they are aged? Don't you realize they are struggling? Besides pension what are your other problems? What other problems, sir? Look how you have tanned walking in this scorching sun? Wonder when you last ate a good meal. Come home and eat a handful of food, sir. Okay, grandma I will definitely come. Greetings, sir. - Which is Narasamma's house. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir. - This is her house, sir. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. Sir, come inside. I can see only elders here, where are your children? In town, sir. How can they leave you at this age? It's not their fault, sir. They did not leave us heartlessly. They have gone to earn for our survival. - I'll serve some more, sir. - Enough, dear. [WATER BURBLING] Thank you for a wonderful dinner, dear. - Please accept this. - Why do I need it, sir? Share it with everyone as this month's pension. I don't need it, sir. You have a long journey ahead. Please use it for your expenditure now. If we come to power what will you need? I don't want anything, sir Govt allocates pension to only 10 persons per village. Unless one of them dies the next man isn't eligible. For the sake of a pension of Rs 75, we need to wait for an old pensioner to die! Incapable of working at this age and unable to do our own work, we lead an uncertain life neither dead nor alive... please do something good for old people like us. Thank you, sir. "This pre-dawn auspicious song welcomes you and your yatra along" "Won't this golden painting" "display your goal this morning?"

Look at these people. Not even a few thousands are following him. He calls this 'Paadha yatra'? If we take this up we will have lakhs of followers, whatever be the place and time. Bribe them with beer and biryani they will surely follow. Provide transport, why stop with a few lakhs, millions will come forward. Look there just once Doesn't look like they are following him lured by freebies. If they are thronging giving up their daily livelihood, we need to be careful. Dear Mr. Rangarao. What is your paranoia? He just doesn't get it. [DOOR OPENS] Greetings sir. Greetings, come sit here. - Sit down. - Please sit. - Hello Mr. Rao. - Greetings, sir. For the amount mentioned by you except Kuppam, you can help yourself to any seat in the State. It's all yours. Thank you, brother. What is great about a MLA seat? If you can join that party, obtain a ticket, Win and bring few members from that party along with you to our party. [PHONE RINGS] - Minister's post is guaranteed for you. - Okay, sir. Boss is calling. Sir, good evening. Brother, how are you? Thank you, sir. I'm fine. They briefed me, I am with you. Don't bother. Thank you, sir. For what all they spoke, we will arrange. - You can decide. - Thank you, sir. - We will take care. - Thank you. That is our commitment. - Thank you very much, sir. - We'll work together. - It's okay. - Thank you sir. Brother, I'm very happy. Best of luck. Sir, do you think that this covert operation will work out? If it succeeds, he will join us, or else he shall get destroyed. - You think so? - Yes. [VENDORS HAWKING] - Greetings brother - Greetings How much is one kg of tomato? Today's market value is one rupee per kg. Did you bring tomatoes? - But you quoted more yesterday? - It fell today. What can we do? - What do I do now? - Hello - I'll go if you pay my amount. - One minute, bro. - I'm bargaining for the price. - Make it fast, bro. - My next client is waiting. - Please wait, I'll pay you. Long live YSR Why have you come at this time? - Where are you fro? - I came from very far, sir. Greetings, sir. Greetings, sir. Long live YSR Sir, I've brought tomatoes. Tomatoes are looking good. But I can buy it at the price of one rupee per kg. How can the price be mere one rupee per kg? That's the market rate. Yesterday, it went up till twenty five rupees. Bring it after a week. - I'll pay you the same rate. - This isn't tamarind to store and... get after a week. This is a perishable commodity. Sir, I'll go if you pay me. Please give me two minutes, I'll pay your amount upon getting a good deal. You... Carry on. - Sir, please give me a good rate - Why should I see you suffer? I'll pay you 1.5 rupees per kg. Go inside and weigh them. Hey, come here. If the price is 1.50 rupees per kg, it won't be enough even to pay for transport, father. Sir, we toiled in the hot sun and rain for the past four months, we sprayed fertilizers for the crops ignoring our health and we nursed our crops better than our own children. If you quote such a low rate how will we make our ends meet, sir? What can I do if it isn't enough for you? Should I pay out of my pocket? Go and feed your tomatoes to the cows. Go now. You won't get the rate you want. Go. Please don't say that. Leave, I say Hey, how many times should I ask you? Pay me and I'll leave. Wait for 2 minutes - Let me check in another shop - Hey, stop. What will I do with these tomatoes if you both of you go away? I don't even have cows to feed. Go and get the money. Your son will be with me until then. Go now... [BOY WHIMPERS] Opposition leader, our beloved leader, Dr Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy will address farmers' concerns now. The main reason for this farmers' meeting is to learn - about the problems of the farmers. - What will you do by finding out, sir? You'll give us assurances and promises. In 5 years, someone else will take your place. We farmers don't trust any political leaders. What you said is true. The reasons why farmers are facing severe problems and losing faith are, it might be due to the incumbent party or the opposition party like us Everyone is to be blamed. I take moral responsibility for this mistake and stand as an offender with my head bowed in front of you. I am here to listen. Please go ahead. There's power cut when we have water. There's no water when there is power. In case we reap the crop as we have both, we don't get a proper price. People say a farmer is a king. We don't need this royalty that doesn't have minimum food, clothing and shelter. Atleast let us live like farmers if not like kings. You've been building airports and Hi-tech cities. They are necessary. Build them, But for farmers... please understand that insecticides, water, manure are equally essential, sir. Even if gold and land rates escalate people buy them without batting an eyelid. But when tomatoes shoot up from two rupees per kg to ten rupees per kg, people say that rate has sky rocketed! Not even one tenth of that ten rupees price won't reach us, sir. People throw coins like alms to beggars for farmers who struggles to reap crops. There is no big difference between farmers and beggars nowadays, sir. [COMMOTION] What happened over there? - Hey! Let's go and check. - Sir, Heard that a farmer named Ramana has committed suicide over there. [OVERLAP OF EXCITED VOICES] Stop him... Stop him... Move... move aside, madam. [OVERLAP OF VOICES] Get the vehicle... [SOBBING] Slowly... Slowly. Careful... Take him to the vehicle quickly. Take him quickly. Careful [GASPING] [OVERLAP OF VOICES] GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL Unable to sell his produce for a reasonable price, a farmer named Ramana tried to commit suicide in the market this morning. What is your reaction on this incident, sir? [CAMERA CLICKS] - Please comment, sir - Sir... Greetings, sir - What happened? - He's out of danger, sir But his vocal chords are severly damaged. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Tell me, Ramana I have... struggled, bor... rowed money... Sir, he can't speak anything. His throat is severely injured. I can hear him. I heard everything. I'm there for you. [SOBBING] What a terrible thing happened, sir? Oh no! "Villages have the aura, crops are a fortune" "Do these words said by our elders still hold their value?" "Eyes filled with tears of agony, pearls of sweat trickle through our body" "Which farm can be cultivated with sweat and tears?" "Clouds drift without raining, land is barren" "Drought shows no compassion, what else exists?" "What is the use of claiming a farmer as a king?" "It sounds like a blame" [MUSIC] "As days and moments pass by" "Farmers' sickle has changed into a question that has no answer" "Is it the crops or insects that get benefitted by it..." "does the pesticide that turns into poison know it?" "Villages have the aura, crops are a fortune" "Do these words said by our elders still hold their value?" "Eyes filled with tears of agony, pearls of sweat trickle through our body" "Which farm can be cultivated with sweat and tears?" "Would we get grain if villagers are suffering?" "Would we survive if the farmer himself starves?" "If cracks split the land we trust duly" "If the cattle are sold to the slaughterhouses" "No ear can hear the woes of a village?" "No one can see the torn dreams" "Villages have the aura, crops are a fortune" "Do these words said by our elders still hold their value?" "Eyes filled with tears of agony, pearls of sweat trickle through our body" "Which farm can be cultivated with sweat and tears?" "Clouds drift without raining, land is barren" "Drought shows no compassion, what else exists?" "Villages have the aura, crops are a fortune" "Do these words said by our elders still hold their value?" "Eyes filled with tears of agony, pearls of sweat trickle through our body" "Which farm can be cultivated with sweat and tears?" Even though if I can't solve your problems it is my responsibility to inform the government as the leader of the opposition party. Protests and blocking roads had no effect, brother. Last time, when we protested near Basheerbagh to reduce electricity rates, we were beaten up by the police like dogs. They shot four farmers dead. How many people can they shoot? If they shoot every farmer who protests, the bullets which the police force have won't be sufficient. Whatever you say or do for this government it is like water off a duck's back, brother Even when cost price of seeds and wages weren't affordable, farmers didn't stop farming, right? If every hungry farmer comes forward, let us see if the the government can stay unmoved. Let us inform about our trials, tribulations and concerns to the government. This time, I'll be there for you. Long live YSR Long live YSR Strongly condemning the government's negligence towards farmers and in a protest against the government's ways [PHONE RINGING] - the opposition leader, YSR... - Yes, sir. Called for farmers strike outside the collector's office. I'm watching that. - Farmers' Union and Left parties... - I will do it, sir. Thank you, sir. Have also extended their support showing solidarity. Don't worry, sir. We have everything under control. We will take care. We witnessed your control and power in Basheerbagh's Farmers' agitation. We are still suffering from the back lash of that incident. Look here, DGP This time, not even a single baton should break or a single bullet should be fired. But that protest shouldn't take place. Curtail farmers' strife. Contain mass suicide. Curtail farmers' strife. Contain mass suicide. Rebate, recede and reduce electricity charges. [UPHEAVAL] - Police atrocities - Down! Down! [SHOUTING SLOGANS] 'Police atrocities Down! Down!!' [UPHEAVAL] In order to maintain peace and security, the government refused permission for the farmers' protest. And the police is arresting farmers and activists who are coming from the other areas and entering into the city. - The leaders who joined the protest... - Greetings, sir. Have been taken into custody' The state police department How are you, Venkat Rao? - How are you, Venkat Rao? - Okay Sir, your 'yatra' has received a huge overwhelming response from the public. Our party will certainly win. Sir, keep this money for necessary expenses. Why do you spend when your ticket isn't confirmed as yet? - I don't mind if I don't contest - One minute Brother, the central forces are all over the place. They are saying that we will be arrested if we step outside. - Nothing of that sort will happen-Long live YSR - Don't go out, sir. Please cooperate.-Long live YSR 'Long live YSR' - You stay here - We'll come with you, brother. Sir... Sir, don't go out. [CAMERA CLICKS] [MARCHING] Sir, please don't go. Please, sir. Sir... Mr YSR didn't pay heed to my words and is stepping out. Okay... Okay. - I'll inform our higher officials. - Security problem, sir Sir We have to take you into custody for violating prohibitory orders. Please cooperate with us. It is a fundamental right in a democratic country to protest. How can you even politicize this in the name of security and order? It's a law and order issue, sir. We've taken everybody into preventive custody. Please. Do farmers seem to you like thugs and anti-social elements? I made the same mistake as they did. Give me the same punishment meted out to them Okay [PEOPLE SHOUTING] Long live YSR Sir, look how ruthlessly the policemen have beaten us. They have beaten us black and blue, sir. Long live YSR Long live YSR Long live YSR Farmers are criminals in the eyes of this government. Farming has become a crime now. Unable to repay their loans, when farmers request for instalments, their lands are being confiscated. If they request reduction of electricity charges, they are being shot. They are punished for the crimes that are not committed by them. But when a foreign company comes here saying they would offer 5000 jobs, land will be provided, roads will be laid, Concessions will be given and non-stop power on a platter for 24 hours. Why are they negligent when it comes to farmers? Instead of being indebted to them, they are being tortured in name of non payment of loans. We spend in millions for the nation's security, There is nothing wrong in it. But food safety is also essential along with that. It is necessary to take responsibility in providing security to farmers as well as in supporting them. Today if I should describe the plight of farmers, they toil for six months and harvest Sona Masoori rice but they consume government rationed rice even on festival days and as they can't afford this rice. In this 'yatra' I met farmers whose eyes welled with tears. I saw dry lands which didn't even get drenched from their tears. I met many farmers who saw these lifeless parched lands and sacrificed their lives! I heard it I'm here for you. After our party comes to power, I'll give immense importance to agriculture I'll give free electricity [APPLAUSE] I will ensure farmers get a good rate for their yields. Future chief minister, Long live YSR! - Stop it! - Long live YSR! This is not our party. We shouldn't support him. I'm a farmer first, only then I'm a party worker. Future chief minister, Long live YSR! [SHOUTING SLOGANS] If your party comes to power, are you going to be the CM? I don't know about that. My party will decide that. Then, how can you make these promises if you are not a CM candidate? If my party comes to power, whether I am the CM or someone else is the first signature will be on the file ensuring free electricity to the farmers. I'll make sure it is signed. I've given my word. I'll think twice before giving my word. Once I do, there is no looking back. THERE IS NO LOOKING BACK. If my party comes to power, whether I am the CM or someone else is the first signature will be on the file ensuring free electricity to the farmers. I'll make sure it is signed. I've given my word. I'll think twice before giving my word. Once I do, there is no looking back. [PHONE RINGS] Yes, madam Yes, ma'am Yes Huh! Like the saying 'counting the chickens before they hatch', There was neither any election held nor our party won it. But he thinks himself to be the next CM and busy promising reforms in people's favour, brother. He knows the difference between the nerve and the bone very clearly. People have responded very well to his 'yatra'. He knows the pulse of the people. - What's big deal in his yatra? - Yes - We can also follow suit. - Okay - We can't travel by foot. - Okay, madam. Okay. We can do a bus 'yatra', brother. We will get a better response. What do you say? He's doling out promises like freebies, sir. Won't the high command punish him, sir? They've granted him a promotion not punishment. He has been given additional responsibility... of being in charge of the election campaign. What are you saying, sir? Are you asking us to forget the enemity with him? Or do you want us to quit politics altogether? There are no permanent friends and enemies in politics, Keshav Reddy. People don't trust us the way they have implicit faith in him. Let him face all the pain and problems. We will share all the positions when we gain power. It's like saying the grandson was born to teach his grandma how to yawn! Is he new to politics? Or doesn't he have his bag of tricks? [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Okay, sir. I'll inform Mr YSR, right now. Thank you, sir. What are they saying, Capstan? They've granted permission for the yatra. Is that so? Who wants their permission now, Capstan? Just because they have granted, can we walk all those miles all over again? [CHUCKLES] They received some important piece of news from the high command. They wants to talk to you, so they are calling you. Well, we'll meet them in the morning. Call Venkat Rao, ask him to make arrangements for the meeting tomorrow. Okay. Sir. Sir. Okay. I'll take care, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Don't let them into the city. If needed, bring henchmen from the neighboring town too. Forget about expenses, I'll bear it. Okay. We will pass on information to press and media tomorrow. He's preaching like Mahatma Gandhi. Let's see. His true colors will be revealed tomorrow. We are there, right sir? We'll show him tomorrow. Let me see how he enters our town with his 'yatra'. Stay right here. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir. Please sit down, I'll inform them. [CROCKERY CLINKING] Hell man, I can't even chew this bone marrow. Where the heck did you buy it? Sir, Mr YSR is waiting to meet you. - Send him in - Sir. He asked you to come in, sir Er... sir, this is confidential matter. Sir wishes to see only you... KVP will also come in with me. Tell him, if we come it will be both of us. One minute, sir. I'll go, find out. Sir, he insists on bringing Mr KVP along with him. Huh! Didn't I tell you, the soul 'atma' is inseparable from the God 'paramatma'? If he wants a position tell him he has to meet me alone. - Please don't waste our time - Okay, sir Sir, if you don't mind, only you can... Just tell what he said. He said if you want a position you have to meet him alone. What is there in position? Compared to the people who believe in me tell him these fancy positions are meaningless. With elections round the corner why rub him the wrong way, Raja? We will see many such titles and designations. We have a plenty of work to catch up. - We are hard-pressed for time, let's go. - Sir... Sir... Sir, please. Didn't I tell you, sir? He won't reform. Greetings, sir They are protesting in the route you've planned. Please change your route, sir We took all the permissions, didn't we? How can we change in the last minute? It's a security problem, sir. - YSR - Down Down! Sir, they are not listening to us. You don't go there. Why are you listening to them? - We have ten thousand supporters behind us - Please sir If we move forward, the protestors will give way. - Please listen to us, sir. - What's there to listen? Don't underestimate YSR and his prestige. Moreover, he hails from Rayalaseema. Generally, people would be scared to stop our vehicle. When that's the case, Who will have the gall to stop you? If we retreat now, others will follow suit and block our way. Let's go forward, brother. Long live YSR. YSR Down Down! Long live YSR I will talk to them. Sir, please sir. If you go now, we will face security problems. Please listen, sir. Sir, please Don't worry. YSR Down Down! [SHOUTING ANTI-SLOGANS] We won't accept your rallies or yatra into our village. YSR Down Down! Our town has 1653 votes. Your party hasn't got even 1 vote till now. That won't change either. There is no use how many ever yatras and rallies you undertake. Please go back. I didn't come here for votes or any political gain. Whatever you may say we won't trust your party or you, nor let you enter. Wait man. I'm talking to this elderly gentleman, right? Raghavaiya sir, I may not see eye to eye with your party or its ideologies. But when I see you fight relentlessly without any selfish interests or desire for power for the welfare of your people I have an immense respect for you. Whether you believe me or not my main intention of this yatra is only to learn about our people's day to day trials but no hidden political agenda. Only if you along with your people welcome my yatra wholeheartedly, I will enter into your town. We oppose your yatra. Please do not enter. I respect your opinion and your opposition. I take leave. [PEOPLE CHEERING] He got terrified by our strength, brother. He stepped back. We won. The Rajasekhara Reddy I know will not give a damn to the opposition. Whether we have manpower or not, he won't take even one step back. But he has changed. This isn't his defeat. It is his victory. Rajasekhara [THUNDERS] I believe you have reformed. You no longer possess your stamp of impulse and anger. Proof of that change is your humility and integrity. I will vote for you this time. Not for your party! [MUSIC] "Huge crowds from all villages rushed in overflowing with joy" "Huge crowds from all villages rushed in overflowing with joy" "All the paths welcomed you" "All the paths welcomed you" "Our leader came as a saviour to protect the poor" "He is a good samaritan who took a vow to be the savior of the poor" "Huge crowds from all villages rushed in overflowing with joy" "All the paths welcomed you" "His heart melted listening to the woes of the poor" "He came in as rain on to the barren soil" "He lent an ear to every suffering soul" "He stood as a support to every threshold of the poor" "He brought in the celebration for the farmers" "He is like a guide to our sinking ship" "Who can stop your rock-solid will to help us!" "Huge crowds from all villages rushed in overflowing with joy" "All the paths welcomed you" "Our leader came as a saviour to protect the poor" "He is a good samaritan who took a vow to be the savior of the poor" "Huge crowds from all villages rushed in overflowing with joy" "All the paths welcomed you" [MUSIC] [PHONE RINGS] Hello. Brother One moment, brother. Brother, Mr KVP wants to talk to you. Raja, media is reporting in our favour now. Why take risks at this time? If you want, I can go and meet him I have to go. [VEHICLE ARRIVES] - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir. He has forged your signature to obtain a gun license, sir. He has even confessed to accepting a bribe of Rs 35000, sir. - I wish to speak to Baasha - Please come in, sir [BREATHING HEAVILY] Sit down, Baasha Bring us two cups of tea. No sugar in Baasha's cup. Greetings, sir Did you really do this, Baasha? Yes, brother. I just can't believe that you did it. What was the necessity to sell your integrity for a mere sum of Rs 35,000? For my son's education, sir. If he wasn't good at studies like me, I would've got him some menial job thinking it as my fate. He studies well, brother. He even got a seat to pursue engineering. If I have to pay a steep fee of Rs 35000 with my meagre salary, this lifetime won't be enough, brother. I didn't want my son punished for my inability to provide. What I did was wrong. I don't mind being punished, brother. [GASPS] Mr Reddy, you are in no way connected with this case. If you want you can say you have no idea who Syed Baasha is. If a person known to you commits a crime, he won't become a stranger to us overnight. I know Baasha very well. Wages fixed by the government are so low and greed makes people like him stoop to this level. Why tarnish your name by supporting such criminals, sir? It is not greed, it is need of the hour. There might be ninety five percent corrupt officers. But a government employee like Baasha who values integrity more than his life can falter or cross the line for his son's education or his daughter's marriage, or for hospital expenses. Sometimes they break the law unnecessarily. Even then isn't it wrong to accept a bribe, sir? We should not tolerate this. s If Baasha who is so honest was tempted to accept a bribe, It is the mistake of our government for paying him a mere 100 rupees per day. Knowing very well it will not cover his basic necessities, it is the fault of the higher officials who turn a deaf ear. Helpless state of leaders like me who are by his side right here. He is not to be blamed, we should bow our heads in disgrace. Whatever might be the reason, it is a crime, sir. If a trusted worker steals from our own house, the reason is our inability to understand her situation and circumstance. Whatever it is, what he did is wrong Instead of reviewing this as a crime and regarding him as a criminal, please forgive him this time considering it as a simple mistake. - Greetings, sir. - Yes? What is it Baasha? - My son, sir. - Greetings, sir. - Study well. - Okay, sir. - If you need anything ask me. - Okay, sir. - Okay, sir. - I will take care. Okay, sir. [CHUCKLES] - How are you, sir? - I am fine, Raja. Come, sit down. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. [PHONE RINGS] Brother, excuse me. - Hello! Greetings Mr. Venkat Rao.-Tell me, Mr. Rao. They have offered Kadiri seat to three other persons. You are in the fourth place. It is said 'information is wealth', I have informed you. Don't forget about the 'wealth' part. Jai Mana Desam party. People have responded very well to your yaatra, Raja. We can give tough competition in the elections this time. How are the preparation for election, brother? That is... I came here to talk to you about that. I don't feel like contesting this time in election, Raja. Why, brother? What happened? Even though I wish to contest, both my age and health don't seem to cooperate. - Just contest for this last time brother. - It's difficult. I have done for the enough, and it's enough. Alright, brother, as you wish. Then, what shall we do about your seat? [CHUCKLES] You only decide, Raja. Whomever you choose you can be assured of our support. If you have no objection, I would like Venkat Rao to stand. What do you say, brother? Good decision, Raja. As you wish. Mr. Venkat Rao, this time instead of Narayana Reddy brother you contest in Kadiri. No, brother. I'll talk to the High Command. A definite no, brother. I don't want any seat. Brother, don't ever trust someone like me in your life. I'll be the 1st person to jump parties if lured by a seat of power! Brother, before I entered politics... my father called me and advised me. 'My son, shake hand with your right hand and have a stone handy in your left hand' 'Be prepared always' he said. All these days I thought that was politics is a nutshell. Between stabbing one's back as a political move and earning one's trust, I realized the difference here, brother. I've learnt by seeing you. Looking at you and your political approach, I realize that I don't need any stone, brother. Brother, I am telling you as a sworn witness, I don't want any post, brother. If I face any trouble in future... treat me with the same affection you showed on Mr. Narayana Reddy. That's more than enough, brother. [CHAOS] We lead an uncertain life neither dead nor alive... i... Please do something good for old people like us. [SCREAMING] [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] He is stronger than me, father. That is why I lost. [SIGHS] Do you know the distance between defeat and victory? As tiny as a rice grain. One who tolerates pain and discomfort 2 seconds more than his opponent... will emerge as the winner. He is suffering from sunstroke. [VEHICLE HONKS] He got very dehydrated. His legs are also very injured. His blood pressure is very fluctuating. He is being treated, he is under monitoring. We'll keep you updated with all the details from time to time Sir... sir... please, sir. One minute. Brother, I already told you not to go. [PHONE RINGS] You would have listened to me. - Hello. - What if something had happens to you? - Yes, I am passing the phone to him. - Don't worry, nothing happen's to me. Excuse me, Jagan Babu is in the line. Nothing happened with me, Sunny. - Look what has happened. - There is nothing to worry. Complete you works and come, okay? [CAUGHS] [INDISTINCTIVE VOICES] [CAUGHS] [INDISTINCTIVE VOICES] I've checked all the reports madam. Your daughter has a hole in her heart, we should do a major surgery. There are too many patients waiting here. It will take days for your turn. It's already been late. I will talk to a doctor friend in a private hospital. Have her operated over there. What will be the cost, sir? Around Rs. 3,00,000. Her life will be in risk if you delay. Please take her urgently. Madam, this is the private hospital address doctor told you about. What will we do with this sir? Sir, if I could afford that money, why would I will come to this Govt. hospital? Madam, you should take loan etc. What is more precious than your child's life? [SIGHS] Even if I go to borrow 1 kg of rice, people will think twice before giving. Who will trust me and lend me that huge amount, sir? Will you do what I say? I will arrange the money for your daughter, come with me. - Greetings, sir. - How are you? I am fine, sir. [INDISTINCTIVE VOICES] - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. Lie down, don't get up. - How is she? - She is alright, sir. He is Dr. Reddy from our village. He use to be a well known doctor before he entered politics. - Oh! - He used to treat for just one rupee. That's why we use to call him, 'One rupee doctor'. Sir, you use to treat people for just one rupee it seems. My sister has a heart ailment. Take this one rupee and cure her, sir. Please, sir. I won't even take that one rupee if it is for you, dear. - Let's go. - Come, sir. - I'll talk to the doctor. - Okay, sir. What is the problem madam? Sir, she is suffering from a hole in her heart and she's in a critical condition. This is the person I told you about. [METAL CLINKS] They live in America. Your daughter has to take care of their grandmother and stay here. They will only give those 3,00,000 rupees for your daughter's surgery. How old is your daughter? Nine years, sir. Can she do all the works? Hmm... [SOBBING] - Rock, paper, scissor. - Rock, paper, scissor. - Hey you are cheating... - No! No... You are only cheating sister. - Let's play again. - Okay! - Rock. - Rock. - Paper. - Paper. Mom! Mom! Kavitha, get up. Kavitha! Get the stretcher... quick! [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [SOBBING] Mom... Mom... Mother, sister is there inside. Chief doctor is on the way it seems. Your sister will be fine, dear. You don't cry come. Sit down. - Don't cry. - Okay! We even have money now, I'll take her to a big hospital and get her treated, - You don't worry. Okay? - Hmm... - That's the girl, sir. - Okay. [SOBBING] If you want your sister to get operated you have to go with them, my dear. You have to stay with them and must do whatever they ask you to do. I don't want to go mom, I want to be with you. [SOBBING] If you don't go your sister will die, dear. How will we get money for her operation? I wish I had got the heart ailment instead of my sister, mom. Then you wouldn't have sent me away and would have kept me with you, right mom? I don't want to go, I'll be with you mom. [SOBBING] - Come, dear. - I don't want to go, mom. [DOOR KNOCKS] [DOOR CREAKS] Come in, dear. What can I do for you dear? [SOBBING] You are one rupee doctor right? You be a doctor all your life. [SOBBING] [COINS CLINKS] My father used to say that... I can helpful for crores of people if you become a politician. Capstan, then why this girl is saying that if I be a doctor it would be better? [COINS CLINKS] If a politician decides to do good, I should show them what he can do. If we get into power, it might be a very big hospital... we should provide free medical aid for every poor person. Free medical schemes are not prevalent even in developed countries like America. Considering our population our funds wouldn't be enough, Raja. In home if our mother or father fall ill, will we leave them lying in their cot saying we can't afford to treat them? If we don't have enough money we will borrow or take loan. If we could not get that, we even try to save their lives by begging right? Why can't the Govt. Do the same for it's own people? Every year the Govt. spends hundreds of crores in campaigning and publicity. If that same money is spent on free medical aid for the poor, will stay forever in every poor persons heart. In my 30 years of political career. I have listened about poverty when intellectuals and leaders were speaking. I have also spoken thinking I know what I'm saying. But for the 1st time I have witnessed real poverty in this yatra. The most dreadful disease is not cancer or heart disease. Poverty! There isn't any other punishment worse than poverty. Poverty is not only about absence of food, clothing and shelter. Unable to provide proper education for one's own son or daughter. Unable to afford for treatment when one falls sick is also poverty. Why can't the poor fall ill? If so, should he or she die due to shortage of cash? Shouldn't the children of the poor have access to higher studies? When our Govt. comes into power, if the poor people gets any trouble and ask help to the Govt. Should not ask about your caste, religion and party. I will give a card beyond caste and religion. When you fall ill. It might be a very big hospital you should go with courage, showing that card. Without even the need of rupee you should get treated. With that same card, a student should be able to study any course with ease. [APPLAUSE] Yes. Sure, ma'am. I will discuss it with him. Thank you. Thank you so much. Sir, chances are real good for us to come into power this time. If we win, we should not dangle like a puppet on his string, sir. Add only those who are favorable to us in the final list, sir. High Command has already approved of the list we prepared. I have been asked to talk to YSR. If the High Command has approved where is the need to talk to him, sir? [BIRDS CREEPING] [PHONE RINGS] Greetings, sir. Sir. 1 minute, sir. Raja, High Command has dispatched the final list of candidates it seems. They want to meet you to discuss it. Only I should go? Or find out if both of us can go. Sir. He wants to know if he should come alone or can he bring an associate? Both of you can come. Both of us can go it seems. Ask him to come over this time, Capstan. Invite him here? Sir, Mr. YSR feels it will be better if you come here yourself this time. [INDISTINCTIVE VOICES] - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. Brother is in a meeting Please take a seat, sir. Please sit down, sir. I'll let him know you are here. Come, sir Please sit down. [SIGHS] Grandpa, how are you? What brings you here? I came to invite brother. Is that so? Sit down. I'll let him know. Greetings, sir. Greetings, sir. Sir, please wait I'll inform brother. Grandpa, go in. Brother will see you now. What is this? - Did you tell him I'm here? - I did, sir. But brother wanted to see grandpa first. Grandpa, come with me. [SIGHS] Tell me. Hmm... Party is very happy with your work, Reddy. High Command has finalized the list of candidates for the constituencies. Sir. What is this? For all the 294 constituencies, candidates list selected by me. I guarantee they will win. Hand it over to the High Command. It's time to eat, come and join me. Please. Veerappa, did you eat? No, brother, I'll eat later. - Come and eat with me. - No need, brother. Sit down. Come sir, sit. Sit down, man. Serve. [DISHES CLINKS] [COUGHS] [CLEARS THROAT] Listen to me, dear. Your fever hasn't reduced. Both your feet are badly blistered. Won't it be better if you rest up a bit? Sun is scorching hot. In case something happens to you again. Does the farmer sweat it out under the shade of a tree? Does the laborer toil sitting in the shade? Whether starving or sweating it out in the sun... they wait eagerly to pour their heart out to me. What is my pain compared to theirs? I know people wait for hours to share their sorrow. I also know how much your assurance matters to them. But all of them are aware of your present state of ill health. If you do not set out on your yatra they will understand for sure. I have to go, Vijaya. I have given my word. My promise holds good whether loss or pain. I have to step forward. - YSR! - Long live YSR. - YSR! - Long live YSR. - YSR! - Long live YSR. "We will be the anxious glances" "to welcome your arrival" "You are like a dawn to us, may you win!" "We will always be with you" "like your army" "You're the turning point of our victory, praise be to you" "There is no one to help and come forward for us" "Was what our fate made us believe" "You stood for us proving it wrong" "Oh great leader who sticks to his word" "We will be the anxious glances" "to welcome your arrival" "You are like a dawn to us, may you win!" We will give free electricity. That auspicious day will dawn Be brave until then. Long live YSR! We have 5 votes in our family. And we will vote only for YSR! Long live YSR. YSR CM. The upcoming elections is not between 2 persons and parties... It's between 2 moralisms. "Never ever into our threshold" "had any ray of light entered" "In the temple of our hearts" "You shine as a lamp forever" "Launching this Yatra in which you never turn back" "Oh people's leader, you became our step forward" "Our hopes were all dried up" "Your support gave them fresh shoots" Sir, my son wants to take up engineering for his under graduation. We can't afford to pay the fees. Do not worry, madam. It is my responsibility to make your son study. If we win, ask your son to meet the college management. If we lose come and meet me.
