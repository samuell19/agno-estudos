[♪♪♪] MOE: We're ready to clean your office, boss. Good, and make it snappy, will you? Oh, I'll be back in half an hour. This story's liable to break wide open in any minute. MOE: "Atomic Documents Missing. Suspects Being Screened." "Top Drawer Secret Data Stolen." Anyway, I'm putting every available man on the job. Oh, boss. How about trying us out as reporters? Yeah, news hawks, that's our dish. Tear off the front page. Stand by for a scoop. Stop the presses. Copy boy, copy boy. Stop the presses! [CRUNCHING] Oh. Moe, Moe. Stop the presses. Now, behave. What do you say, boss? Will you give us a break? Well, uh, you boys see me after awhile, will you? I'm going out and grab a bite of supper. Okay, get busy. Go ahead! Go ahead! Clean this mess up. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] Ow. Oh, Moe. I'm sorry. [GRUNTS] Now, I'm sorrier. How do you feel? You look like a bird in a gilded cage. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Hello, is the boss in? No, the boss stepped out for supper. Any message? Well, this is Smitty. Tell Mr. Cameron I found out that the missing atomic data is in the hands of foreign agents. If I hear anything else, I'll let him know. Okay, okay. I'll tell him. Who was that? That was Smitty. Smitty? Oh, I know him. Under the spreading chestnut tree the village smithy stands. That's him. Ha, ha, ha. Get outta here, you. Cut it out. You flathead. That was Smitty, one of the reporters. He says a foreign agent got the missing documents. Hey, wait a minute. This is a scoop. This is our big chance to become reporters. If we can find that foreign agent, we're in. Boy, you got something. You know, porcupine, for a guy without brains you're a genius. We get the story, the boss has gotta give us a break. [IN RUSSIAN ACCENT] They will never find these documents. On this film I have recorded the secret of those documents for my country. [CHUCKLES] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Who's there? STOOGES: It's us. Your neighbors. Hello. [CHUCKLES] How do you like it, Bortch? But why do you dress like this? We've disguised ourselves so we won't be recognized. We're looking for a foreign spy who stole atomic secret documents. We're undercover reporters, so to speak. Yeah, and since you speak so many foreign languages, how about helping us tonight? Tonight. Tonight I will be on the ocean. My visa has expired and I must leave your glorious country today. That's too bad. Boys, I want you to do me a favor. I'm having too much luggage to take to the ship. I want you boys to carry these melons for me. In an hour you'll meet me at Pier 7. The boat will be there. MOE: Okay, pal. Now, we will have a farewell drink. Oh, a drink. Oh, boy. Little drink now. This you will love. Pre-war. [CHUCKLES] Good. Here's how. [MUMBLING] [MUMBLING] [MUMBLING] Pre-war? Next one. [SNEEZES] [BOAT WHISTLES] Hello Bortch! Hello boys, I'm glad you're here! Oh, we had a tough time out there! Yeah, hey, brush my back off, will you? I'll brush you off. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Oh, no, wait. Oh, no, I'll take the melons, boys. Okay, easy. There we are! Ah, I love the briny deep, it does something to me! [BOAT WHISTLES] Well, boys, I, uh-- I guess we'll be going. So long, Bortch! Hey, the boat's movin'. We better get outta here! Yeah. [BOAT WHISTLES] It's no use getting excited. I got a secret for you. I am a stowaway, and you are stowaways, [LAUGHING] [ALL LAUGHING] Hey, what are we laughing for? I wonder what became of that Shemp. You know he went up on deck to scout for some food! Speaking of food, my stomach thinks my throat is cut. Me too. Hey, let's go find some grub for ourselves. Okay, but we better take our shoes off first, so we can sneak around the ship quietly. Good idea. [GRUNTS] I'm sorry, Moe. That's all right, kid, think nothin' of it. You're broad-minded. You're narrow-headed. Come on, get outta here, or I'll knock your brains out. Hey, skipper, how would you like that kipper? Mm, I'd love it, but how are we gonna get it? I don't know, we-- [WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] Come on. Calling Miss Emma Blake, please come to the purser's office immediately. Miss Emma Blake, please come... Now, you be good and don't go away. Miss Emma Blake. [WIND BLOWING] It worked. Oh, boy. I got the beer. I got the fish. What have you got there? That's a dish of fish and it's perfect, you can take my word for it. On fish, I'm a common-sewer! Mm, we will divide. I am starve to pieces. I'll open the beer! Okay. Nervous beer. I'll nervous you with-- Hey, food. Here you are boys, eat hearty. Thanks. Mm. [GULPS] [SPLASHING] [HUMMING] [COUGHS] [COUGHING] [COUGHING] Boy, I hope Shemp got something decent to eat. You and your ideas about fish. I'm a common-sewer. [GRUNTS] Yeah, you. Oh, delicious, if I only had some whipped cream. Oh, I wish I hadn't eaten so much of this, I don't feel so good. I wish I hadn't eaten so much either. I wish this boat would stop wobblin'. Oh, softies, can't take it, eh? [LAUGHING] I'll eat it, don't worry about it. [LAUGHING] Give me the high seas, give me the salty water. Oh, I wish I hadn't eaten so much salami. Oh, boy. [LAUGHING] They can't take it. [GROANING] Oh, no. What's the idea, spilling water on me? Go on, beat it. [SNIFFING] [SNIFFS] [BOTH SNORING] Suckers, let them sleep on hard boxes, I'll swing myself to sleep. [GRUNTING] How do you like that. [BOTH SNORING] Yeah. I made it. [BOTH SNORING] Now, for a little peace and quiet. [MUMBLING] [MUMBLING] [SNORING] [SCREAMING] [BOTH SNORING] Oh. Oh, what a night's sleep. Oh. What's the matter with you? You crazy? [SHEMP MUMBLING, SNORING] Get up, come on. Oh, why did you wake me up? Why didn't you let me sleep so I wouldn't know how much hungry I am. He's right. Hey, why don't we eat the watermelons? Come on, let's go. [SNORING] [CHUCKLES] Look. I don't see nothing! [YELLING] Oh, and big seeds. Oh, a prize. What's this? Hey, get the other melon. [SNORING] Uh-huh. Oh. No wonder Bortch acted so mysteriously. [SNORING] The melons. That melon is here. Hi. MOE: Bortch is the spy that stole those government documents, We'll turn that baby over to the authorities. Shh! Now, you hold this film for safekeeping, until we do away with that spy. That's what you think. That's what I said. Hello. [GROWLS] Run! Ah! Give me that film! BORTCH: Give me that film. I got you now, you rat! Let me have it! MOE: That took care of him. [BIRD CHIRPING] BORTCH: Give me that film, give me that film, or I kill you! I'll brain you! [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Do your stuff, baby! Whoa! [BIRD CHIRPING] Why, you back-biter, I'll take you in myself. Mr. Bortch! Yes! [BIRD CHIRPING] There we are. Oh, boy, we got our scoop. We're reporters from now on. All we gotta do now is notify the boss. You... You got him. Nice work, Moe! We'll turn this bird over to the authorities at the first port. See if we're near land. Aye, aye, captain. Get out of here. Oh, no, not again. Land! Land! [♪♪♪]
