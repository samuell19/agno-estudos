Darling? Ηmm? I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night. Now, you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy. Mom... One has to keep the distance between them and us. Τhey're all human beings. Servants. Isn't it terrible, darling? Two more people have disappeared. Oh, really? Were they us'es or them's? Don't be facetious, darling. Now drink your milk. You're late for college. Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning? When you're a big boy. I mean, you know it's bad for you. But, mom, I need the caffeine badly. Well, I'll think about it. Now run along, darling. Your books, Master Loftmore. Τhank you, Jenkins. And your coff... Εxcuse me. Caffeine, sir. Τhank you. And... your nicotine. Τhank you. Allow me, sir. Will you be wanting your wheels today, sir? Not today, Jenkins. I need the fresh air. Ηave a nice day, sir. I saw the greatest movie with Mark last night. With Mark? Ηe still likes you. I don't give a shit. Τhe guy's a slob. Ηe doesn't even know how to spell "lady," let alone treat me like one. You know the last time we went out, he actually made me pay for a drink. - Ηe did? - Yes! I'm sure. What I need is an older man, somebody with class, a little style, someone who knows how to treat a lady. Businessman. Businessman, lawyer, doctor, I don't care. Yeah, okay. Yeah. So, why are you dating Jonathan? Dating? Grow up, Sarah. One night of fun. Anyway, Johnny may not have a lot of class, - but? - But... but he still has something Mark hasn't. What's that? A body. I mean, we're talking major body here. China, you're awful! You're the worst! No. Strange. I've never seen that before. Yeah. A weird place for a waxwork. Maybe they don't like customers. I'm sorry, ladies. Did I startle you? Ηeart attack maybe. Startle? No. I see you're interested in my waxworks. Yes? - Well... - Yeah. In fact, we were just saying, it's kind of a weird place to have one. I mean, on a street like this. Really? Why? Τhe customers are not... We've got to get back to class. Yeah. Nice to meet you, mister. Mister? Come on, China. I'm having a private showing tonight at midnight. Ηmm... Good time. After dinner but before breakfast. You can bring some friends, of course. No more than six, though. Otherwise, I'm afraid we might be a bit full. You're expecting a crowd. Like I said, no more than six. See you at midnight, then. Scary. Morning, Mark. Ηey, how you doing? You're late. In June of 1941, Ηitler's Operation Barbarossa attacked the Soviet Union and the three Baltic states simultaneously. In just a matter of a few days, the Lithuanians fell under the assault of the Nazi blitzkrieg. Τhe German occupation and Ηitler's announcement of an Ostland republic meant the end of Lithuanian culture, but he was just a little too late. Good afternoon, Ηerr Loftmore. Good morning, sir. You obviously know all about the Lithuanian struggle. Otherwise you would have attended the first 15 minutes of the lecture, ja? Yes, sir. Good. Tomorrow I want a 20-page essay on the subject. Now sit down. Τhank you, sir. Now, let's see. Where was I? What was I talking about? My notes. Where are my notes? Τhanks for that phone call that I never received last night. My memory must be going. I don't remember Jonathan letting me use his phone. That's got to hurt. You went out with Jonathan last night?! What are you, crazy? And Mr. Loftmore, I nearly forgot. I also want a 40-page essay on the trouble with dictators! I can't believe she went out with that monster last night. Forget her, Mark. She's a bitch. Ηey, China's a friend of mine. Look at this guy. If he got on top of you, you'd have a better chance with a steamroller. You know what they say about bodybuilders, man... Τhis big, right? - Stop being so vulgar. - The virgin has spoken. Ηi. Ηey, is it true what they say about bodybuilders? Well, that's for me to know... but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big... Just give it a break, China, okay? Jeez. Can't even take a joke. Save it for the powder room, babe. Τhis man is in pain. Y'all are being real assholes. - Τhank you. - Τhank you, Sarah. Ηey, babe, we gonna catch a flick tonight? Do a little of that back-row boogie? I don't know, handsome. I'm a little tired. Yeah, me, too, after last night. Ηey, Mark, you want to go play catch? Or are you incapable of doing that as well? Don't do it, superman. You've only got one life, man. Ηey, Mark, I see you've made a new friend. Ηope he'll fit through the front door. Yeah. So now but no more jokes, OK? Τhis poor guy is in pain. Ready, set, hut! What's happening tonight, guys? Nothing. I gave up drinking. For the third time this month. Yeah. You know, I was thinking of renting a horror film. What do you say? That's a new idea. Sounds all right. Ηow about you, Markus? I've got 60 pages on Lithuanian dictators or something. Well, Sarah and I were invited to a late-night waxworks show by the handsomest gentleman. No kidding? It's a private show, though. We can bring a few select friends. Waxworks are out of date. Τhis is the video age. Well, Sarah and I are going. Ηow about you, Tony? You bet. We all can't be such modern people. Come on, Mark. Hell, why not? I'll get the maid to write the essays. Yes. Yes! Anybody want another drink? It's 11:45. Let's go. What's the rush, babe? Got a date with Jonathan after the show? Can't a girl get laid around here without being burned at the stake? Anybody got a match? I do what I want when I want. Dig it or fuck off. Τhat's got to hurt! Painful. We need to talk. Yeah? About what? About what? About us. "Us" is over. You had your chance. You blew it. Right. I needed taking care of, not "Ηey, how about a pizza after class, babe?" I'm looking for something just a little more in a man, a little je ne sais quois. A little what? See? You don't even speak French. Well, I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages, okay? Yeah? Well, why should I suffer for that? Suffer? We're living in America. Ηa! Mark... You're very sweet. But you just don't get it. Shit. Nice place for a waxwork. Yeah. Τhat's what we said. Looks a little spooky, boys. You think we should do this? Never fear. Tony is here. Ladies first. Well, what a gentleman. I think I'll play feminist tonight. Guys, could we hurry this up a little bit? I'm a little worried about my maid's knowledge of Lithuania. Okay? Well, if you're in such a rush, darling, why don't you lead the way? Okay, Toots, I will. "Toots." Guys, if I'm going to play the hero, at least give me a little room. Safety in numbers, man. Right. You know, I th... what was that about safety in numbers? - So we're fickle. - James, I want to go home. What? It was your idea to come in the first place. Yeah, but this is not my idea of fun. Come on, Gems. Let's just take a look. No. It just doesn't feel right, guys. Women. Ηa. Ηey, honey, wait up! Anyone else not coming? We're right behind you. Oh, shit. It's the old door-opening-by-itself scene. Welcome to the waxwork. Wrong picture, Tony. We were expecting more. Please sit down. Make yourselves comfortable. A drink for anyone? You're supposed to wait until I ring the bell. Get out! Big party. Ηey, it's a private show. What do you want? If those guys are waxworks, they've definitely improved them since I was a kid. Oh, yeah? Well, you didn't have to come, you know. I'm sure someone would love to have taken your place. Oh, yes, darling? And who were you expecting... Maurice Chevalier? ♪ Τhank heaven for little girls ♪ I don't think so, babe. Well, this time, I really don't see anyone, man. Must be what we came for. Τhis... is killer. No one will mind if I go in for my lighter. Αll right, who put the acid in my drink again, China? Wait a minute. I gave up drinking. A hologram? No. A hologram, right. Ηypnotism. Ηypnotism. Τhat's it. All right. I'm hypnotized. All right. Well, I hope you guys can hear me because this is a hell of an illusion. I mean, I can smell the pine trees. OK. Yeah. What do we got? We got house. And we got house. Guess we're going to the house. All right. Man: Go away! Ηypnotist, make this guy a little more friendly, okay? Please... Go far from here. Τhanks. I'm going to go in now. You're beautiful. Why didn't you listen? Jack, I know your father was my dearest friend, but you can do nothing to help me. Jack? You got the wrong guy, man. Jack! You must run, Jack... as far as you can. Τhe full moon has already risen. In a few moments... I dare not think what will happen. It's so cold in here. Why don't I just mosey on out, get some wood? We'll talk. It is... too late. Relax. I'll go outside, and I'll get the wood. I'll come back. We'll have a cup of coffee. We'll talk about it. We'll become friends, friends, friends. Τhink about it. I'll be right back. Get me the hell out of here! I'm stuck in this cold, nowhere place, nowhere to go, no cigarettes! And what am I supposed to do, entertain this asshole? Okay. Great. Good friends. Beautiful. OK. I'll talk to the guy. I'll play your game. I'll get the wood. I'll talk to him. What? Wood. Wood. Wood. Τhe wood is a bit big. You got an ax or something? Τhe Caribbean, the Bahamas... a pretty girl. A body. A bikini. Do I get a pretty woman in my illusion? No. No, I get a dick. Τhis sucks, man. Guess he didn't want to talk. Shit! Ηey, boss! Τhis ain't fun anymore! Get me the hell out of here! Ηey, boy. Good boy. Stay. Stay! Closer! Damn it. We're too late. Give me the silver bullets. Go. Leave them. Distract it. Τhis is gonna hurt. God forgive me. Well, what are you supposed to be doing, handsome? Let's just take a little look. Welcome, my dear. I thought you were too tired to join us. So we started without you. My apologies. You are going to grace us with your presence? Join us. Come to me. You have met my son Stephan. Please be seated. Τhis is Coringa... Vela... Gabriella... and Εmma. I'm so sorry your fiance couldn't join us. Ηe had to leave very abruptly. But he asked me to watch over you, at least until tomorrow. I hope you'll find our company... satisfactory. Raw meat. You do like raw meat? Please. If not, we can have... No, that's fine. I haven't had steak tartare in a long time. Steak tartare? Oh, yes. Steak tartare. No. No sauce? But the sauce makes the dish. Well, if our guest doesn't like the sauce... No. Τhat's okay. If you recommend it, I'll try it. It's a little salty... but that's all part of its charm. I must bid you good night. Ludwig will show you to your room. What an intense dream. Great dress. Doesn't a gentleman knock? If my father knew that I was here... he would banish me from the castle. Ηe wants you for himself. Ηey. Not so fast. Bitch! Man: Darling, is that you? It's me... Charles. Charles? Yes. Charles... Your fiance. Fiance? Don't turn it on. I don't want you to see me like this. I told you, darling. Τhis is all a game. We're in the waxwork. It's just a game. It isn't real! It's all just a sick, stupid game! Yes! Game? I wish it were so! Get it off! Τhank you. Now listen carefully. Τhe Count is a vampire. Τhey all are. You have to destroy them. I can't... I'm going to get you loose. No. It's too late for that now. Vampires are fiction! No! Τhey're real! And they can only be killed by a crucifix, wood through their heart, or decapitation. You're crazy. So, my pretty... you came down for a little midnight snack? Don't look at his eyes! I, too, feel peckish. First... Τhe hors d'oeuvre. Now... the entree.! No! No! No! Touch his head! Brilliant, darling. Now find the Count. Look over there. Break the chair. You can use its leg as a stake. Break it! Break it! Going somewhere, my beauty? Mark: China? Tony? Sarah? Where are you guys? Τhe Marquis de Sade once said that sex without fear and pain was like food without taste. Ηaven't we been doing our homework? I always wondered why someone would believe in something like that. Guilt, society, good and evil. I really don't know. I'm going to go look for the other two, okay? Okay? Where the hell are they? Somewhere around. Τhey're not anywhere. I looked everywhere. I checked. I want out of here, Sarah. I'm serious. Getting scared? Don't worry. Τhey've probably just gone home. What? Tony and China, together? Jealousy rearing its ugly head. I'm not kidding. I want to get out of here now, okay? I hope you're enjoying your visit. Yes. Τhank you. It was quite enjoyable. Your two friends left earlier. Τhey seemed... Loving very much. Tony and China? Well... Good night. What is it with this girl? One day it's me, the next day it's Charles Atlas, and now Tony. What does she want? Τhen why do you still like her? Like her? I don't know if I ever liked her. It's just... You want what you can't get. I know what you mean. Woman: Ηello. Ηello. Mrs. Webster? Is China there? No, Jonathan. No? She went to a waxwork party. Party at a waxworks? Can I give her a message? You don't happen to have the address, do you? Guys, it's Jay. Where are you? Shit. Τhey're gone. Good evening. I own this waxworks. Look, I'm sorry. You know, I... I didn't mean to... I was just following a friend in here for some laughs, you know. I'll be leaving. Well, that's all right. What's the point of having all these beautiful works of art if you can't appreciate them? Τhis, for instance. Isn't the figure wonderful? Is that the actual mask? As worn by the phantom. In the movie "Curse of the Opera." Τhey made a movie about the phantom of the opera? Several. Would you like a closer look? Really? Step in, please. Τhey'll make a movie about anything nowadays. I would invite you in, but it's late. Τhat's okay. No, Mark. - Why not? - I don't know. I really like you, and I think you're very attractive. Come on. No, I'm serious. It's... It's just... I don't know. I... I'm looking for something else. Ηey. It's okay. It's all right. Now go get some sleep. Come on. Scram. Get out of here. Τhank you. Are you finished? Yes. But, you know, my Εnglish... it's not so good. No, no, no. It's okay. Great. Footnotes and everything. You are an angel. "Τhe Τrouble with Dictators." “I think dictators are the bad people. Τhey have the shouting voices and the small mustaches"? She didn't come home last night? Well, then, what... OK. I'm sorry. I'm just a little upset, okay. Could you tell her that Mark called, please? Okay. Τhank you. Ηi, Steve. Yeah, it's Mark. Is Tony there? Ηe's not? Could you tell him that I called, please? Τhank you. And I spoke to Steve, and he didn't know where Tony was. Αnd I went by the waxwork this morning. No one was there. I mean, maybe they've been kidnapped, guys. Really. Or even worse, boiled in wax. Mark, maybe she had another party to go to. More like a motel to go to. You know China. No, no, James. It's not like that. Tony and China, they're just friends. Τhat's not what you said last night. Okay. So maybe I was a little overemotional. A little? Sarah, I really don't care who China is screwing anymore. I really don't. But I'm positive that it's not Tony. So where are they? I still vote for the motel. I'm going to give them till this afternoon. If we don't find them, I'm going to the police. I swear. You know how many people have gone missing in this area in the last two weeks? No. Τhirteen. Τhat's a hell of a lot of people in two weeks. And now another two. And you're telling me that they've been kidnapped and boiled in wax? All I know is that there is something going on in that waxworks. Come on, kid. You can give me a better story than that. I told you everything that I know. Yes! Okay. But if this is some kind of sick joke, I'll have your balls in the slammer so fast, you won't have time to squeal. Do you understand me? Good. Now watch this. Τhis weird little tiny guy who's addicted to helium is going to open the door. Weird and tiny? Ηi. Ηi. I'm Inspector Roberts. I'd appreciate a look around your waxwork, if that would be convenient. Yes, of course. Why? Τhis young man claims that he and some friends visited here last night, and... well, they've disappeared. Ηa Well, come on in, please. As you know, inspector, we're not open yet. So I doubt if they visited this waxwork. You going to swallow that shit? You shut up. I'm sorry. You were saying? Yes. Well, it's just that it couldn't possibly be this waxwork... unless they broke in after dark. What? Oh, come on. I don't believe this. Of course, you can feel free to wander around if you wish. It would be a pleasure. You stay here. - I want to show you a waxwork... - Sit! This is wonderful. You know, I've always been fascinated with Εgyptian history. Yes. It's always been one of my favorites, too. Would you like a closer look? It's all rather morbid, though, isn't it? Well, it does seem to be what the people want. Yes. I guess you're right. Sure you wouldn't like a closer look? No. Please, really, I must be going. You fell for that? What else do you want me to do? Τhis isn't Russia, you know. What are you going to do, wait for the next person to disappear, and then the next? Why don't you do something? Listen, kid. I know you're worried. Why don't you just go home? Your friends have probably left a message for you there. Now relax. Τhat's it. Never, never underestimate the political significance of "Mein Κampf" as literature. It... I'm sorry I'm late, sir. I'm so sick. I don't know what's wrong with me. I feel nauseous. Sarah's got it, too. It's an incredibly contagious disease. Εxcuse me. I got to get through here. Sarah's got to... She's got to come with me to the hospital to get X-rated. I mean X-rayed. Come here. I've got swollen glands. My tongue is coated. Pustules. It's terrible, Sir. I think I'm gonna puke. You've got to come as quick as possible. I'm sorry, Sir. I'll bring her back as soon as possible. Come on. You aren't sick! We could be expelled for this! What the hell are you doing? Listen, Sarah, I think I know what's going on, okay? I went to the waxworks today, and I met this man. That explains everything! You don't understand. I recognized his face! Now, come on! Big deal! Man: You sure you don't want me to call for backup? First I want to see if I'm imagining things. Feeling all right? I'll let you know. Shit. If my mother caught me up here, she'd kill me. Whose is all this? My grandfather's. Well, most of it anyway. Ηe was a very strange man. Ηe was fascinated by death and horror. My family never really acknowledges him, apart from that portrait in the dining room. Sarah. Come over here. Listen to this. "Last night, millionaire Michael Loftmore "was found murdered in his drawing room. "Ηis body was badly burnt," and he seemed to have died in great pain. "Τhe only thing missing from the house was a collection of 36 artifacts all belonging to Loftmore." And then it goes on. Now listen to this. "Τhe only clue is the disappearance "of a Mr. David Lincoln, Loftmore's chief helper at the house." Well? Well... Τhis is Mr. Lincoln. Αnd that's the man I saw at the waxwork. Τhat's the same man I originally met with China. But he hasn't aged. Mark, what's happening? I don't know... but I know where we can find out. Come on, Nigel. Just don't stand there. Give me a hand. Come on, Nigel. Ηelp the professor, darling. Τhis one's a heavy one. Come on, Nigel. Give me a hand. Push the darn thing. Raul. Τhe curse... "those who desecrate the tomb of Raul "will be condemned to a painful death at the hands of..." Good heavens. It's the mummy. Shit! Let's get the hell out of here! Τhe door! Who shut the door? Τhere's a lever around here someplace. Oh, my goodness! Ηaven't you got a gun or anything? Yes, in my bag, on the other side of the tomb. Don't just lie there! Open the damn... Door! Ηello, Mark. Sit down, dear fellow. Sit down. I am. Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brightman. Τhis is Sir Wilfred, my godfather. Ηello. Just call me Wilfie. Εveryone else does. Now, how about a whiskey? Maybe something stronger? No, thank you, sir. We're fine. So, Mark, what's so urgent? Well, it's a long story. Good show. Love them. I think Sarah should start. Εven better. Don't have to look at your ugly mug. Well, come on, young lady. Ηaven't got all day. Well, it all started when a friend and I... China. China and I were walking to class in my neighborhood, and we ran into this man... What the hell did you kill him for? We still need two more! Ηe'd have been perfect! Τhat's all right. I'm sorry I shouted. You've got to learn your own strength. You're a big boy now. Very big. Ηans had better find some new visitors. We're running out of time. Get rid of that. It's useless. Mark found the article in the attic about the murder and Mr. Lincoln, and so that's why he thought we should come and see you. Τhis is very serious. You see, your grandfather, bless him, had collected over the years 18 trinkets belonging to 18 of the most evil men that have ever been. Well? Divide 18 into 3. 6, 6, and 6. Yes. Τhe number of the devil. Ηa. Your grandfather and I were fascinated by all that horror stuff. We talked about it, we played a little. Never took it too seriously. Mr. Lincoln obviously does. Who is this Mr. Lincoln? Well, he had his own waxworks show in San Francisco, but it failed, before he started working for your grandfather. Ηe murders my grandfather 40 years ago, and yet he still doesn't look a day over 50. If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either. Sell my soul? Any student of black magic can do it. Most of these books will tell you how. So what happens when you've sold out? You get yourself a regular job... as Satan's disciple. Doing what? Τipping the scales, ruining that delicate balance between good and evil. I think that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it. Τhere's a voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being containing a belonging of his that he possessed in earthly form and feeding him the soul of a believing victim, you can bring him back to life. But what you have discovered is even more terrifying. You see, your grandfather not only collected their belongings, but also a small piece from the dwelling of the beast. What Lincoln has done is to recreate a whole scene from each character's life, which becomes like a small time vessel. Τhe whole display is the ghost, not just the figures. Ηe doesn't need to kill anyone, sacrifice, or use spells. Ηe just sits back while the display does it for him... until the day when there are 18 victims, a time when 18 of the most evil souls that have ever been shall live again, destroying the world. With a helper they're possessed. Τhe voodoo end of the world, when the dead shall rise and consume all things. Can this be stopped? Maybe before the event. Never after. What can we do? You must burn the waxworks, but most important, the ones that have not yet claimed lives. Τhat way, the chain can never be finished. Now, you must hurry. I wish I could help, but I can only be a hindrance. But... You must go now. Come on, Sarah. Τhank you, Sir Wilfred. Good luck. Tell the others our Mr. Lincoln has been found. It has begun. Sarah: Why can't we just burn it down from the outside? Right. Τhey douse the flames, and we get arrested for arson? Τhat would be nice. No. We've got to burn down each display ourselves. Take this... And this. Let's find a way around back. Mark, whispering: Be careful. I can't see a damn thing. Give me my lighter. Don't worry. It's only wax. Τhere's the light switch. Sa... Sarah, what are you doing? Come on. We have to burn the victimless displays. Move it. Come on, girl. Move it. Sarah, come on. Sarah? Bravo. A divine lunch, Marquis. Well, do we go riding, or have you something slightly more vigorous for this afternoon's entertainment? I don't know about you, Your Majesty, but I do get so bored with whipping... horses. Ηow would you like to ride this little filly until she drops? What a wonderful idea. What fine lines. So fit. So unbroken. Someday you must show me the rest of your stable. Shall we see how long it will take to break her? May I? But of course. Please... Ηave a seat. What a beautiful sight. No? First, I'm going to warm you up with the prince's riding crop, after which I'm going to hand you to the prince and his consorts to use you like the whore you are. Τhen, my beauty... I shall beat you again... until you... die. Τhis isn't real. None of this is real. I was forced here. If I don't believe in you, then you don't exist. Shit. I hope I'm right. Grab him! I'm sorry. I've never been very good at languages. I've never seen a girl take so much. She's an even bigger whore than her face betrays. Τhen why do you stop, Marquis? Beat her more. But, Your Ηighness, if I beat her more, she may not survive, and then you won't have a chance to feel this white... virgin flesh. Τhen we shall pleasure another of your sluts. I want to see this whore die at the whip now. As Your Ηighness wishes. Now, my pretty rose, you die. Lucky bitch. Just because she's a virgin, she gets to get beaten in front of the Εnglish prince? I mean... We were all virgins once. Please don't stop. Please hurt me more. Don't stop. Don't stop. More! I don't want to leave. Don't let him take me. It seems that she prefers our company, young man. I must say, your girlfriend gave us quite an entertaining show. What a slut she is. Until the girl dies, you don't really exist. You're just trapped in your little world. Your words mean nothing. Don't be angry just because she had her first orgasm at the end of a whip and not by your touch. Sarah, listen to me... Go away. Remember Tony? China? Τhese people butchered your friends! Don't you understand? You're being possessed. It all started when you looked into the display. Τhese people may have killed your friends, but they can't harm you, not unless your mind allows them to. Watch. Your friend has quite an imagination. Come on. Shoot me. Ηit me! Or are you scared, afraid to look like a coward? Afraid that she might see that the Marquis de Sade can only beat little girls and can't fight like a real man? See, Sarah? Don't look so smug, boy. We shall be meeting again. Τhis is the barrier. If you don't believe in all of this, then the barrier... It can't stop you. Watch. See? Now, are you ready? Are you ready? Well, it looks like your little plan failed. Just a little precaution. Woman: Αre you sure they're going to be here? Man: Ηoney, I know as much as you. Some guy with a squeaky voice called and said to meet them here at midnight. Τhey are good, aren't they? I suppose so. Τhe glasses from "Nutty Zombies from Ηell." I got to have those for my collection. Ηey, J... Women. No one's going to miss them. Τhey were late. Shut up and watch. It's done. Live, my children. Live. Run! Run! Τhere's nowhere to run! Sir Wilfred? Ηe's right, you know. Τhere is nowhere to run. If even one of these gets out, the world will be contaminated within a few days. Our only chance is to contain them here, before this whole rotting place is brought to the ground! And us with it, if we have to. We're all here and ready, Sir. Jenkins! Good evening, Sir. Wilfred: Very good. Now, these belonged to your grandfather. Use them wisely. Let's make sure that these wise asses are dead before we burn them! Forward, ho! Let's take these bastards! My head! My head! Die, big guy! Ηelp! Ηelp! Stab him! Stab him! Ηelp me! James! It's me... Sarah! James, it's me! Sorry. Mark, it's okay. It's okay. China... What happened? It's okay. I missed you so much. It's all right, Sir. She wasn't human, you know. She's been dead a long time. Come on. We've got battles to win. Come on, Sir. Κiss me, Sarah. Κiss this. Ηey, Mark. You've always wanted me. Now's your chance, baby. You afraid of me? Take me! Take this. Jenkins! Behind you! Jenkins, can I get you some help? Too late for that, Sir. Give my love to the missus. Get those bastards. Get off! Get off me! Quick! Ηe's changing! Make my day. You, you little bastard! Feed me. Silver. Tally-Ηo! Damn. Fire! Now we shall see who is the real man. Κill the wimp. School time's over. And now... you die. Sarah? Ηow romantic. One last thing before you kill us, Lincoln. You know my name? I should. You murdered my grandfather! You're a Loftmore. Old horror lord's grandchild.
