Oof! - Larry? Larry? Has anyone seen my pet ladybug? - [gulps] No... - Guys, guys! I've grown a flower. - Whoa! - Ooh! - That's just glued on. - You can't glue on a flower. - You can glue everything. Look! I glued eyes to my butt. [laughter] - Everyone stay close to your pot spots! Don't wander too far. - Too late, Boo! Ha ha ha! Tag!

Don't say-- - Um, did somebody say Christmas?! - Ah, yes! Sing for us, Albert! - Me? Sing? Oh, I don't know if I can... - [chanting] Albert! Albert! - Albert! Albert! Albert! - Ha ha, come on, Albert. - Who's ready to get their jingle on? [all cheering] - Sing it, Albert! - I'm ready! I'm ready! JINGLE ME! - Ahhh, here we go... - * I admit that when it comes to Christmas * * I can get a little extreme * It's been a year of waiting, so I'll start decorating * - * The morning after Halloween * - * Bring on the red and green * Come on, sing those carols and chime those chimes * * I'm ready, so let's do this * * Trim the trees, let's start with me * * For the Christmassy-est Christmas * * So come on, everyone, let's get our jingle on * * And cover every square inch with lights * * Hang all the bling we've got * Right there.

Ha ha ha ha! * Ring those bells and light those lights * * I'm ready, so let's do this * * If it's up to me, this one will be * * The Christmassy-est all: * Christmassy-est - * Christmassy-est - [off-key] * Christmas! [music winds down, stops] Nailed it. - Eeew, Lola's got a weed! - Ahhh! - She's got a weed. Maybe I've got a flower. Ever think of that? Weedist. Oof! Aah! - Ooh! - Eew! - Ugh! Try cleaning your butt yard once in a while, Gramps. - Off my lawn! - Owww! - Oh! Get outta here, jerkweed! - The name is Geeeen-- Oof! - Be nice. It's Christmastime! Goodwill towards all, remember? - So warm and moist. Ahh... - Ooh-whee! Uh, 'scuse me, guys, I don't wanna disturb you or anything, but there's fresh Christmas trees on the lot! - Oh! - Ah! - Get outta my way! - I wanna take a gander! - Calm down. Come on. Everybody'll get to see 'em. - Check out that bark! - Oh ho ho ho ho! - Check out those stems! - It's me and the spirit! - Hubba-hubba! - They're big! - That's some serious plants! [plants murmuring] - Hey. Why are you so blue Christmas? - [sighs] Those trees outside-- someone's gonna take them home, make 'em all twinkly and shiny. And right on top will go a big, bright star. [sighs] Why not me? - Uh, guys, I don't wanna alarm you or anything, but Earth Mama's comin' back! [commotion] Get back to your pot spots-- pronto! - [grunts] Ohh! [light, suspenseful music] - How did you get down here and all gussied up? - [gasps] Is that your Christmas tree, Grandma? - This pipsqueak? Ha ha ha! He's not ready yet. - Ya got the delivery for Baker's Hill, Ma? - It's in the back. We just need to load the truck. Sweetie, do Grandma a favor and take off all those ornaments. [mellow music] * - Lots of people think I'm a pipsqueak too. * Awesome! But my dad always says it's okay to be small, as long as it doesn't stop you from doing big things. [door thuds closed] - And she's gone! - Aah! I'm so glad she plugged you in! Oh, you look so nice all plugged in! - I do, don't I? [laughs] [buzzing] - [chomp] Aw, no. Ugh! - Delicious bamboo... [panda crunching] is the panda's favorite food. - Aah! Turn it off, turn it off! - [grunts] [jazzy, seductive music] - Yeah. - [chortles] - Not in front of the children! - Aw, man! - So the search is on for the world-famous Empire City Christmas tree. I'm here with tree expert Horton Farber. Now, professor... [thump] what makes the perfect Christmas tree? - Ha ha. Right. Robust branches are a must for any Christmas tree, the better to hold those ornaments and lights. Some delight at the aroma of a tree, or "nature's perfume"... - [inhales] - As I like to call it. But the truly perfect Empire City Tree that captures our hearts and imaginations, it radiates all the beauty and wonder and joy that-- [voice breaks, sobs] I'm sorry. That is Christmas. [uplifting music] - [gasps] Albert! Everything he said-- that's you! - [gasps] I can be that tree! - Yes! [overlapping encouragement] - Ha ha ha! You? - Why not me? - Tomorrow, I'll be joining Professor Farber at Baker's Hill, Vermont, where he will select this year's Empire City Tree. - All right, plants! Baker's Hill! We need coordinates! - We're here, and Baker's Hill is there. I'd say it's about 3 inches. - [gasps] That's so close! - Ugh. What are they putting in your mulch? - Wait, now hold on, hold on, hold on. You're leaving us, Albert? [plants murmur] - Albert, we--we love you. [cacti whimpering, sobbing] - I will never forget you guys. - Again, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Albert, your ride's leavin'! - [gasps] - You'll be sorry! - No. I'll be a Christmas tree! [laughs] all: Go, go, go! - No, no, no! - What the dingus is goin' on here? [plants gasp] - Oops! [clang] [lightly suspenseful music] - Go, Albert. Follow your dreams! - Ha ha ha ha! - [chuckles] It's gonna be a very peaceful Christmas this year. [squish] - Ooh! [clang] [cacti giggling] [exciting music] * - Whaa-- Albert! - [gasps] - Albert! - Maisie! [exciting music] [thud] - [grunts] - Whoo-hoo! * - Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-- - Whoa--oh-oh-oh! No, no, no! Oh, my lights! I can't be the Empire City Tree without my lights! Yaaaah! Oof! - One more stop at Baker's Hill and then... - Empire City! And then... both: The greatest Christmas Tree in the world! - Whoa! So this is outside. - Yeah, brutal, ugly, and cold. Brrr... - [soft crying] - Do you hear that? It's like someone's crying. [crying continues] - We're being transplanted! - [laughs] Aww! Aren't they cute? [all crying] - Can I tell you a secret? I'm on my way to a new place too. You think I'm scared? I am. - You are? - Yeah, even a big tree like me. Sometimes we all feel small. But that's okay, as long as it doesn't stop you from doing big things. - [giggles] [bang] all: Whoa! - [gasps] [suspenseful music] Noooooo! [rapid hopping thuds] - Uh, Dad, what's Grandma's little tree doing on the truck? - You're seeing things, honey. - Not things. Grandma's tree! - Ah... [brakes squeak] [clattering] - Uh-oh! - Oh, bite my bark. [suspenseful music] * [dramatic musical buildup] - Holy Blitzen! Coulda sworn I covered those up. - The tree was here. I saw it! - Maybe you're just hungry, sweetie. Let's get some lunch! I see things when I'm hungry, too. One time, I saw a giant fried chicken. - Whoo! That was close. - I think I wet my soil. - [muffled] Help! Help! [louder] Help! Help! - Talking snow! - Whoa! The outside is a strange and mysterious place. - [groans] Ugh! Someone's underneath! - [gasps] - [whimpers] Cold, cold, cold! - [gasping breath] Ohh... Ohh...uhh! Sweet relief! I got snow in places no cactus should have snow! - Hey, are you okay, mister? - Mister? Yeah, yeah, yeah, like you don't know who I am. I love it, the whole not recognizing me thing. Hello! Cactus Pete! * Come on down to Cactus Pete's * * We'll show you * A prickly good [off-key] * Time - [gasps] You're on a sign! - A sign? How 'bout plates! Cups, napkins--the menu! - How 'bout the toilet paper? [laughter] His real name's Roy. He changed it after he got the job. [laughter] - [growls] - What were you doing in the snow? - It's a brutal and sadistic tale. [festive Latin music] 11 months outta the year, I'm the hottest tamale in town. [singer whooping] * [somber music] But as soon as Christmas blows in like a bad smell... [brakes screech] They toss me out like trash just so this pretty boy can take my special spot! [growls] [quietly] I hate you. - [sighs] Check out those lights. - That tree has nothing on you, Albert. [tense music] - [chuckling] Well... aren't you mister shiny and twinkly? - Albert's gonna be the Empire City Christmas Tree. Maybe you've heard of it. - Well, you don't say? The most famous Christmas Tree in the whole dang universe. - Guys, we should roll. - Well, not the universe, not the whole thing. [chuckles] Just the world. - Oh, don't be modest, Albert. - Yeah, don't be modest, Al. You're the Empire City Christmas Tree, Al. Everyone loves you, Al! - Oh ho ho ho, that's because the truly perfect Christmas tree, like moi, radiates the-- Aah! - I know all about Christmas trees, jocko! [mocking] "We need room for our precious trees. Let's throw the cactus outside. It won't mind." Well, I do mind! I mind a great deal! - [nervous laugh] We should go. - Sharpen your needles, boys! It's time to show our friends a prickly good time. - Ooh, whatever you say, Roy. - [blows] - [groaning] Ohh... [pffft] - Destroy that tree! [cacti grunting] Albert: Aaaah! [dramatic music] * [thump] [base scraping] - [inhales] - Aah! - You gotta shoot back. - Gene's right. Make us fly, Maisie. - Not what I meant! Albert: Aaaahhh! [thump] [thud, sizzle] - Ohh... * - [growls] - Head for the truck! - Yee-haw! Ow! - Aah! - Aah--ooh-ooh-wah-oh! [dramatic music] Maisie! - [gasps] Aah! - [grunts] Run! Oh! - Albert! - Behind you! - Yah, yah! Ooh! - Wow. - Dang. * [gurgling] [ice cracking] - Ha ha ha ha! Now, that was a prickly good time! [laughter] - * O, Christmas tree * O, Christmas tree * How heavenly are thy branches * - Leave Albert al-- - Hah. That's the best you got? - Aah! [crash] - Maisie! - Ha ha. How's it feel... knowing there ain't gonna be no stinking Empire City Tree this year? - Let me get back to you on that. - Man, I hate Christmas. Ooh! [groans] Ohh... - Yes! [truck engine turns] - Next stop, Baker's Hill! Ha ha ha! Wait, no! No, no, no, no! - Wait, wait, wait! Wait for us! - [panting] No! No... [somber music] - I'll get us a new ride faster than you can say "Every wish comes true if the wisher who wishes it wishes hard enough!" - Where'd you dig her up? Come on, let's go back to that cozy, wozy wonderful store. - You're a quitter. - I'm a realist, pal. Even if she does find us a truck, which she won't, what are the chances it's gonna take us to Baker's-- [engine turns] - Yoo-hoo! Baker's Hill anyone?! - Maisie, ha ha ha, you're amazing! - Unbelievable. - I'm the best, I'm the best! Aw, yeah! I'm the best! Ooh-ooh! I found a truck! Ooh, yeah! Let's go! [ominous Latin music] * [soft music] Oh, boy! This is gonna be the best Christmas ever! Can you feel it, Albert? - Whoa! [chuckles] There are stars in the sky and snow on the ground. It's everything Christmas should be. [sighs] But something's still missing. It's me! [upbeat music] * Bows top presents perfectly * * Snow's like frosting on a tree * * The stockings and the sleigh bells * * Are a lovely touch * But there's room for improvement in everything * * And Christmas is missing a certain zing! * * It's a matter of time until I get to shine * * And then everyone will see * The best thing that can happen to Christmas * * The best thing that can happen to Christmas * * The best thing that can happen to Christmas * * Is me - What about Santa? - Yeah, he's pretty great. - And the nine flying reindeer? - Uh, there were only eight. - * When it comes to Christmas * * You can't have too * Much both: * There's more to be merry and sing about * * The timing is right, and the moment's now * - * The star of the evening might not be the star * But, actually, the tree! - * The best thing that can happen to Christmas * * The best thing that can happen to Christmas * * The best thing that can happen to Christmas * * Is meeeee Yaahhh! [whack] - Ha ha ha! The best thing that could happen to Christmas is me... beating the sap out of the shiniest, twinkliest, Christmas tree in the world! - Whoa! What's happening? [tense music] [Cactus Pete groans] - "Bakers Hill. Paper--Paper Mill?" [all exclaiming] - Aah! - Aah! [buzzer blaring] Oh! - I don't wanna die in screaming agony! - [whimpering] Hold on to something big! - At least we got rid of Cactus Pete! - Think again! Ha ha! - Albert! [bang, crunch] - Maisie! Hang on, I'm comin'! [banging, crunching] - Oh! - Wrong again. You're goin'! - Oh! - Ha ha! Oh, boy. - Ah...aah! [dramatic music] - Yes! Pete, I know a way out. But I need your help. - What's your plan? - Gene can flip the switch! - [groans] - This is not a plan. It's--aah! [intense music] - Hurry up, Gene! - Hurry! - [grunts] It's stuck! - Albert! - I'm sorry, Maisie! I'm sorry! - At least I'll take you down with-- Aah!

[dark music] * [hinges creak] * [dramatic musical flourish] * - Let the auditions begin! - Hmm. This could work. - We can't have Christmas without a tree. - Bring it, Boo! - * If it's up to me, this one will be * [straining] * The Christmassy-est-- Oh! [music stops] - [sighs] Oh. Next!

[sobbing] [eerie music] [wood creaking] [wind howling] - Whoa! I didn't know trees grew so tall! Hello? Hello! Does anybody know how to get to Baker's Hill? Anybody? Maybe they're too tall to hear. - Maybe you're too short to be heard. [snow crunches] - A bunny! Aw! - I don't like the way she's lookin' at me. - Gene, only you could be paranoid about a bunny. - Yeah. She's such a honey bunny! [giggling] The cutest wittle fuzzy muffin in the world! - [chomp] - Aah! Hey, stop! - [growling] [eerie stinger notes] Ouch! - [growls] You want a piece of me? - [snarling] - He already got a piece a' you. It's the piece a' me I'm worried about. - What's his problem? - [snarls] - Aah! [ominous chords] - Another one? How many are there? - You don't wanna know.

You're sharing a pot with the next Empire City Christmas Tree! [crack, clatter] - Oh, my last one! I can't go out there without my ornaments! - Oh, don't worry. We're gonna get ya all holly jolly. Aren't you gonna help? - Why bother? - Gene, this is my chance to be a real Christmas tree. - Albert, you don't need any of that shiny, twinkly stuff to be a Christmas tree. You shared your pot with me when no one else would. You treated me like a friend and not some filthy weed. If that's not what Christmas is all about, then I don't know what is! - Thanks, guys. - If anyone says you're not Christmassy enough, send them to me. - Break a branch! And not literally! Just an expression! [inspiring music] - Trunk in. Branches out. Be...the tree! [whimsical music] * - Oh! This is it! We found our tree, everyone! * [music goes off-key, stops] - Christmas tree!

I mean, tell me, am I'm wrong? - Hear that, Betty? Shrimpo wants your job. - Ha ha ha ha ho! Look at you! Oh, I've got pine cones bigger than you, little sprout. - I'm not a sprout. I'm just short. [soft music] * Leave me alone! * - Albert! Ah-choo! Albert! Ah-choo! Albert? Oh, there you are. - All my life, I dreamed about being a Christmas tree. - Forget those jerkweeds. They don't know their butts from their branches. - Come on, let's go home. - No way. Everyone at the nursery is just gonna laugh at me. - Ah ha ha! What's funny is that you actually had me fooled. I really thought you were the famous tree! But hey, I gotta thank ya, Al. Because of you, I found the real Empire City Tree. * O, Christmas Tree * O, Christmas Tree * Your flames will shine so * [laughing] * Brightly Ha ha ha ha ha ha! - Noooo! - [laughing] - He's gonna destroy the Empire City Tree. And it's all my fault. - Don't blame yourself, Albert. It's her fault too. - Yeah! Feel better now? - No...no. How did Pete survive the Mill? - He's unstoppable. [throttle up humming] - No, he's not. - Whoo-hoo! Ah, yeah! [epic music] [funky upbeat music] * [cars whooshing] [horns honking] - Yikes! Where are we? - Leave it to me. - Ah-choo!

We gotta get to Empire City Square! - Hey, SCUZZ! We got a weed in need here! - Harry! Let's get these newbies to the square ASAP! - Yo, take it down a notch. - See, everyone else treats weeds like dirt. So we help each other. - It's the weed creed. - How can you grow in a crack? - Hey, babe, it's just a crack. But it's my crack, all right? - It's a crack. - Hey, we got your route!

[funky upbeat music continues] * [whack] - [yipping] ["Joy to the World" plays] - [gasps] - We're here in Empire City for the lighting of the world's most famous Christmas tree. Professor Horton, what can you tell us about this year's tree? - Oh, that trunk! Those branches! - Is that Albert? - Yeah, if he's been scarfing a buttload of fertilizer. - You mean, they didn't pick him? Well, I would have picked him! What's wrong with them? He was perfect! - Hey, down in front! - Cactus Pete! [dark notes] - [shivering] Save...the... ah...ah... ah-choo! - Maisie? Maisie! [echoing] Albert?! - Maisie! You're freezing. - We gotta warm her up. [light music] * - I know you. You're from Grandma's nursery. A tree like you shouldn't be out in the cold. Dad! Dad! The palm tree from Grandma's store. You gotta see this! Someone's pulling a fast one. [suspenseful music] * [pot thunking along ground] - Well, if it isn't my old pal Al, the little tree that couldn't. [laughs] Look at yourself! - [groans] I may never be a Christmas tree, but I am not letting you ruin Christmas. - Oh ho ho ho! Sassy words, amigo. Oh, sometimes I'm so bad.

[soft music] * [uplifting music] * - [grunts] Uhh! * - Folks, the Christmas star has sliced off the top of this beautiful tree. Sliced it like a knife through a holiday cheese log. - You don't have to be a scientist to know that a Christmas tree without a star is... [sniffs] not a Christmas... Tree? [light music] * - Are you okay? - Yes! Someone get me a pot, a shovel, and ornaments. Quick! - You heard the professor. And while you're at it, get rid of this ugly cactus. - [groans] Oh... - I don't know how you got here, my little friend, but thank Christmas you made it. [heroic music] * - Daddy! That's him!

Go spread joy to the world or some reindeer-poop like that. - You don't really hate Christmas, Pete. - Oh, stop. - What you hate is being left out. I know how it feels. - [exhales] You're talkin' nonsense. - We're not so different, you and me. We both have needles, but... no one hangs ornaments on yours. And that stinks. - I... I always wondered what it would be like, bein' all shiny and twinkly and feeling the warmth of those lights and...making everyone feel merry! * Hmm. [exhales] Listen, I'm, uh... I'm sorry. For everything I did to you. [sighs] I've been nothin' but naughty this year. - It's not too late to do nice. - Whoo-hoo! Hey, look at me! I'm Mr. Shiny McTwinkly!

I get around. - I hate to alarm y'all again, but Earth Mama's on the move! Hurry! - You wanna do what? - But we've got presents to open! - Just one second. - What is it with her and that tree? - I don't know how you did it, little tree, but I'm glad you're back.
