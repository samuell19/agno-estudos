Actually it doesn't sound that bad Glasses, key, comforter and ring can be expressed as companionship Bonnie likes it The word eternity if one person is gone it would not sustain But the next life it sounds like an appointment if one person is gone first they could still have a chance to meet Bonnie thinks it's so romantic That is exactly what I want to express You totally get it Really?

Because you didn't lie to me so I don't want to lie to you and am afraid you would mind You mean K Hmm Not at all Good then A gift for Christmas Thanks Why do people get married? Married? Hmm So when you're old or you need someone to take care of you he can accompany you no reason asked Then I don't want to get married What?

Yes Nevermind I don't want to think about it I am so hungry Is there anything to eat? I don't want to eat this This is really good It really is No I'll go make some noodles Not for you "I don't envy the sun" "it can't illuminate your past" "there are certain darkness" "in both of us" Be merrier You are making it too sad It's a sad song already "I am too jealous of the time" That's too cheerful "it can leave in poise" "If there is no need to speak up" Do it right "then there is no need to hide" I think you are singing it a bit careless I am singing it very seriously What if Bonnie sings it like you do and the new song fails Wait Dear lyric writer You should know that I did this only because you asked me to I know Thanks Thank you Taking care of Yuan-Yuan so much That should be my line Thank you for being there with her for so long You took good care of her Then you probably know that we live together But make no mistake we really are just friends Yuan-Yuan told me about it You two are great friends sort of like a family in a sense So she asks you to help pick the wedding dress sounds pretty reasonable to me About the wedding dress, I... This is what Yuan-Yuan wants I want to do as she asks And this would also be the last important thing you did for Yuan-Yuan You get what I am talking about right? What do you think? Is it pretty? It's beyond pretty Do the groom like to try on the suit?

It's none of your business So do you want to have the dinner or not? No You will never have it once I get married What are you worrying about? She only heard my voice She can't possibly know who I am She knows you are Yu-Hsien Yang's ex girlfriend I don't want to take that risk They why do you ask me to call you and pretend dating with you Pretty scheming of you I have to let her give up on me Floriography Everlasting love Solitarily powerful In the next three years you can help me give her cactus This is the last step that you are hoping for One for each year after three years she won't notice I am gone Doing this you sure it will make her happier?

I don't know for how long But if she finds out everything is over Before think about other people you should think about yourself first I am not important But she's different She is all alone She needs someone to be there for her You are all alone too aren't you? The first time I met K is a month after my family died Death has taken my family But K was abandoned by his family That day he looked pretty sad and needed a hug more than I do From that day on I decided to call him K As for me, I am Cream After all, two lonely people should have a name feeling less lonely You said that K is about to die You think I should tell him I already knew If he didn't want you to know he probably has his reasons Would expose him now make any difference? I only want K to be happy No matter what happened I will do anything to fulfill his wish Do you have any wishes? I hope you find a nice guy and get married What is the definition of a nice guy? Got a job some money I wanted so bad that his wish is to be with me and with good health but for K who is about to leave me even though I don't want to I will do everything for him Who is that guy? The vampire? He is my high school classmate He is a dentist This doesn't count as a kiss, right? Does it? I want to know you more I am engaged Therefore, sorry, Yu-Hsien I used you If I am with you I think K would be relieved Sorry I used your kindness for me Your consideration for me I know even if I am thinking of someone else you will still take me in Waiting quietly for the time to move me Why do people get married? Because when you are old or need to be taken care of he can accompany you with no reason asked Then I won't get married Marriage needs a ceremony to be called a marriage When can we get married? If you really love me we can do it anytime Please forgive me My love one is about to die I really can't think it all through Hi, I am K If I have a next life, I want to be a ring a pair of glasses I shouldn't detest eternity a bed I want to stay beside K forever One two Three, cheese Wait me here I will go put on another dress Thanks I will call you back Ok Sorry It's all right I am suffering from the great pain I know K is too I made a promise to myself If he turned around I would confess everything to him If he turned around I would give him a big hug "I love you" I wanted to say I love him out loud "Hope you will be happy" but I knew I would burst into tears once I said it I couldn't hold on anymore Thanks Can you do the wedding rehearsal with me? Yuan-Yuan Sung for richer or for poorer in sickness and in health Will you take the man in front of you to be your husband? I do K and I became really husband and wife the happiest moment in my dream is fulfilled I thought we can go on together forever But in the real world K gives my hand to another man The feelings I have for K from 16 years old until now has gone so deep it can never be dredged up again Yu-Hisen Thank you for everything you did Thank you for loving me I have found K I want to go see him Hi Here you are I have been looking all over for you Silly You know you're having a fever It's fine It will be fine soon I am warning you No more instant noodles from now on no more walking in the rain no more popsicles no more extra shifts you hear me?

We're home It'll be fine here Sorry Cream I arranged your romance without your approval Do you like it? Let's take another picture You asked me once before Let's take the photo about my wish My biggest wish Here is to be with you together forever K and Cream We are a family We always have been Take the photo now Long time no see Hi Why are you here so early? I thought you might get busy later Let me show you around Sure Hi,I am K If I have a next life, I want to be a ring a pair of glasses a bed I still can't understand now An idiot like Che-Kai Chang really existed in the world If love can be explained no one in the world will suffer from it I underestimated love I told Che-Kai Chang before Yuan-Yuan Sung She could be tougher than you think She will do fine even if you're gone But I was wrong The love in their point of views is based on each other's happiness "Then there is no need to hide" "a kind of sorrow" "is your name staying in my past" "breathing with me, shaping my smile" "Can't seem to forget" k Do you know? After my family left I thought happiness left with them until I met you I realized that two lonely souls as long as they can stay with each other can have the right to be happy We are destined to meet each other No one can replace that Do you know? What I want is not someone that brings me hot coffee in the cold winter but someone who eats popsicles with me in the rain so much so that our teeth hurt What I want is not a guardian but someone who would do the adventures with me I don't want anyone else I don't want anyone else I want you K Thank you for everything you did As long as I get to stay with you it would be the happiest thing for me "and stay in my past" Sorry "Can't seem to be forgotten" I love you "a kind of sorrow" "Che-Kai Yuan-Yuan's grave" "Is your determination to let love become" "the light that shines on me" "giving me warmth" "but not permitting me" I keep wondering why call me K? Because I am Cream That's it? Because we have no family since we were kids and we live together K and Cream all have the same consonant K Don't you think it sounds like a real family? "A kind of sorrow" "Don't want to be apart" "and miss you so back to back we look around" "You are everything" "you are an eternal figure in a photo" "to be remembered" "2002-2015 What we share every day defines Eternity"
