THESE ARE GIANT BUTTRESS TREES HERE. GREAT SHELTER. IT REMINDS ME OF KAKADU IN NORTHERN AUSTRALIA, RIGHT? THE COVER'S SO THICK ABOVE THAT THE LIGHT COMES IN IN LITTLE BEAMS LIKE THAT. - LET ME SEE THAT. - GINA! WHOO! GINA! GINA, GIVE IT BACK. COME ON. I DON'T GET A CHANCE TO RECORD THE MEMORIES? HEY, JOHN, YOU READY FOR YOUR CLOSE-UP? WATCH IT WITH THE CAMERA! WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? WHOA! LET ME GET THIS. ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. AM I RIGHT? YOU SEE BEAUTY.

HEY, IF IT WEREN'T FOR A FEW SURPRISES, AND IF I KNEW EVERYTHING, THEN WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT, YEAH? OKAY, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GET BACK TO WALKING OUT - FROM UNDERNEATH ALL OF THIS? - OH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. YEAH, IT IS A GOOD IDEA. IT'S GETTING LATE.

I THINK IT'S A LITTLE PAST THAT. - OKAY, GINA? - NO. LOOK AT THIS. BRIAN, WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS? IT'S A KIND OF OFFERING, GERALDINE-- A SIGNPOST. VILLAGERS FROM KARNI MATA LEAVE THESE SPIDER SKINS - FOR GOOD LUCK. - COOL. CREEPY. - ARE WE GOING THERE? - TREKKERS DON'T GO THERE. TOO FAR OUT OF THE WAY. OH, THAT'S GOOD. - HAVE YOU EVER BEEN? - NO. BUT I HEARD ABOUT IT. APPARENTLY THERE'S AN AMERICAN DOCTOR WHO LIVES AMONG THE VILLAGERS. BEEN THERE FOR YEARS. OH, REALLY? IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT-- THAT WOMAN DOCTOR... YOU KNOW, SHE LIVED AMONGST THE APES. YEAH, KIND OF. SINCE THIS IS OUR LAST NIGHT, I JUST WANTED TO SAY IT'S BEEN A REAL PLEASURE SHARING THIS EXPERIENCE WITH YOU ALL-- APART FROM GINA. OH, COME ON. VERY FUNNY, PHIL. - WELL, YOU DO TEND TO COMPLAIN A LOT. - I WAS ONLY JOKING. WHAT DID YOU SAY? I MEAN, YOU COMPLAIN. THAT'S, LIKE, YOUR THING. IT'S, LIKE, EXPECTED. RIGHT? GUYS? WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? I DIDN'T MEAN IT TO BE SO SERIOUS. MAYBE ONE OF US SHOULD SAY SOMETHING. NO, MAN. WITH THESE TWO? WITH THEM GOING WAY BACK, IT'S PROBABLY BEST NOT TO GET INVOLVED. OH, RIGHT, TYPES THAT TALK ABOUT SUBTEXT RATHER THAN WHAT'S ACTUALLY BEING SAID, YEAH. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS, BUT OKAY, BRIAN, YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT? - WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU TWO. - OH, BRIAN. WELL, WE WERE. - NOTHING BAD, BUT YOU TWO WERE ARGUING. - BRIAN, JUST STOP. OKAY, IT'S TIME WE ALL WENT TO BED. WHAT DO YOU THINK? WAIT A MINUTE. WE'RE JUST GETTING TO THE GOOD STUFF HERE. AS A WOMAN, I CAN TELL YOU, NO GOOD WILL COME OF THAT. YEAH, FOR THEM MAYBE. YOU COMING? NO, I THINK I'M GONNA HANG OUT HERE FOR A WHILE LONGER. WHY? MAYBE I'M NOT TIRED YET. OH, RIGHT. OH, GOD, A SPIDER. SPIDER! OH MY GOD. OH, GOD, IT BIT ME. OH, MY GOD, THAT BURNS. - WHERE'S IT HURT, GERALDINE? - SHOULDER. IT BIT ME ON MY SHOULDER. - IS IT BAD? IT FEELS REALLY BAD. - NO NO. NO NO, IT'S NOT BAD. OKAY, HOOK ME UP WITH A COLD PACK. SOME PAINKILLER NOW. GERALDINE, HOW'D YOU KNOW THIS WAS A SPIDER? I SAW IT CRAWL AWAY. IT WENT OVER THERE. WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE? IT WAS A SPIDER-- OH MY GOD, IT BURNS. WAS IT BROWN? WAS IT BLACK, WHAT? OH, GOD. OKAY. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S DARK. I DON'T KNOW. I COULDN'T SEE IT. - HOLD THIS FOR ME, WILL YOU? - HERE. OH, GOD. - WHAT DO WE DO? - OH, IT LOOKS BAD, MAN. I MEAN, IT'S REAL BAD TO GET THAT STRONG A REACTION STRAIGHTAWAY. - OKAY, SO WHAT DO WE DO? - IF SHE DOESN'T GET HELP SOON-- IT'S A FULL DAY'S HIKE INTO TOWN. BY THAT TIME, SHE COULD BE-- WHAT ABOUT THE VILLAGE? THE DOCTOR? YEAH, RIGHT, THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAVE TO HAPPEN. YOU SAID THAT WAS WAY OUT OF THE WAY. - IT'S STILL NEARER THAN TOWN. - YOU SURE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE SOMETHING FOR THIS? WELL, IF WHAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT DOCTOR IS TRUE. WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? WE SHOULD LEAVE RIGHT NOW. - YOU SURE THIS IS THE WAY? - SO SAYS THE MAP. BUT HAVING NEVER BEEN, I CAN'T SAY I'M CERTAIN. I COULD HAVE REALLY USED A "YES" THERE, MAN. LIE TO ME! - HOW'S GERALDINE? - NOT GOOD. DID YOU GIVE HER MORE PAINKILLER? YEAH, LIKE HALF THE BOTTLE. WE-- WE NEED HELP. SICK. SPIDER. SHOULD WE FOLLOW HIM? YEAH, I THINK THAT'S THE PLAN. COME ON. WHAT DO WE DO NOW? BRING HER IN. QUICK, LIKE SILVER. - IS SHE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT? - PATIENCE, LIKE JOB. PATIENCE, LIKE JOB. THAT ONE. THAT ONE, YES. WHAT IS THAT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SHH, SHH, SHH.

HOW'S GERALDINE? OKAY, WHEN THE GUY WITH THE SACK ON HIS HEAD COMES, THAT'S KIND OF MY CUE TO LEAVE. YES, SIR, FOR ONCE THE GIRL SPEAKS SOME SENSE. ANYONE? ANYONE KNOW WHAT SHE'S SAYING? IT'S A SPELL OF PROTECTION. TO THEM, SPIDERS ARE GODS. SHE'S-- SHE'S MAKING AN ATTEMPT TO GET THE GODS WHICH TAKE CARE OF THEM, AND NOW YOU. YEAH, WELL, YOU CAN TELL THEM I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF SPIDERS, THANKS. YOU'RE ALL LOOKING A LITTLE WORSE FOR THE WEAR. GERALDINE, HOW IS SHE? NOT GOOD. UNFORTUNATELY, YOUR FRIEND WAS BITTEN BY A BOLIVIAN BAJA SPIDER. ATRAX ROBUSTUS. EVEN THE SMALLEST DROP OF VENOM, A PINHEAD, IS LETHAL TO SMALL ANIMALS. FORTUNATELY, THOUGH, THE SAME SPIDER PRODUCES HIS OWN ANTI-VENOM. HUMANS CAN'T EVEN HOLD TWO OPPOSING THOUGHTS TOGETHER WITHOUT GOING OFF THE DEEP END. BUT SPIDERS-- - FORGET ABOUT THE SPIDERS. WHAT ABOUT THE HUMANS? HOW MUCH IS LETHAL? ONLY LESS THAN A DROP, A LITTLE LESS. AND GERALDINE? SHE'S BETWEEN THIS WORLD AND THE NEXT. I'VE DONE EVERYTHING I CAN WITH WHAT I'VE GOT. AND NOW... WE'RE IN THE PROVERBIAL WAITING GAME. - WHAT? - WHAT? SO WHAT NOW? SHE NEEDS REAL HELP. THE REST OF YOU SHOULD FOLLOW THE TRAIL BACK, HEAD TO TOWN. I'LL STAY HERE WITH GERALDINE. - YOU'RE NOT STAYING HERE BY YOURSELF. - IT'LL BE FINE. - IT'LL BE FINE. - YOU'RE ALL WELCOME TO STAY. I ASSURE YOU THAT NO ONE OUT THERE COULD DO ANY MORE THAN I'VE ALREADY DONE. REST, EAT. I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOUR FRIEND. OKAY, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT I'M STAYING HERE. IS EVERYONE JUST FORGETTING ABOUT THE GUY WITH THE SACK ON HIS HEAD? OKAY, I'LL LEAD THE GROUP BACK AND WE'LL TRY TO FIND SOME HELP-- A MEDICAL AIRLIFT, AMBULANCE, WHATEVER THEY USE OUT HERE. BRIAN, ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO STAY? YEAH, I SHOULD. I'LL STAY TOO. SOMEONE SHOULD STAY. OKAY, STACEY, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY - THAT YOU CAN STAY HERE ON YOUR-- - WE CAN'T JUST RUN OFF. - YOU CANNOT STAY HERE-- - I'M STAYING. AND WHAT DO YOU CARE ANYWAY? IT'LL GIVE YOU MORE TIME TO SPEND WITH HIM. - STACEY, DON'T GET ALL-- - JUST GO. - YOU SURE YOU WANNA STAY HERE? - DEFINITELY. IT'LL BE AN ADVENTURE. ANYONE ELSE FEEL LIKE WE'RE BEING WATCHED? HOW CREEPY. COME ON, LET'S JUST KEEP GOING. ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT? IT'S A MAP, PHIL. I THINK I CAN HANDLE IT. YOU KNOW, AS UNTHRILLED AS I AM TO BE OUT HERE, I AM STILL MUCH MORE RELIEVED TO BE AWAY FROM THAT PLACE. THAT DOCTOR GAVE ME THE CREEPS. I THOUGHT HE WAS KIND OF COOL. HE WAS LIKE THE COLONEL AT THE END OF THAT MOVIE. PHIL... "LIVING WITH THE NATIVES." EXCEPT HE'S NOT CRAZY. YEAH, WELL, YOU'D HAVE TO BE CRAZY TO WANT TO LIVE OUT HERE. AHH, HERE WE ARE. EAT. EAT, MANGE. YOU KNOW, I HAD AN ENERGY BAR EARLIER. - I'M STILL GOOD ON THAT. - I'M NOT HUNGRY. I'LL JUST... DOCTOR, YOU SAID THAT GERALDINE, IT WAS A BOLIVIAN SPIDER? A BAJA SPIDER. VERY VENOMOUS, BUT STUNNING. ALL SPIDERS ARE VENOMOUS. IT'S ALL ABOUT NECROSIS. BUT YOU SAY BOLIVIAN, AND I THINK OF SOMETHING LIKE SOUTH AMERICA - OR SOMETHING NOT... - WELL, WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE SAYING NOT HERE, RIGHT? - YEAH. WELL, THAT'S AN ASTUTE OBSERVATION. AND I'LL TRY TO OVERLOOK YOUR THINLY-VEILED ATTEMPT - TO DOUBT MY EXPERTISE. - I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT SHE'S SAYING. - I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT. - YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. THIS SPOT ON THE PLANET IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER SPOT ON EARTH. YOUR ASSUMPTION IS RIGHT. YES, ALL SPIDERS ARE REGIONAL, EVERY CLASS OF THEM. WE HAVE BAJA SPIDERS AND BLACK WIDOWS SPINNING WEBS TOGETHER ALONG WITH BROWN RECLUSE THAT'S ONLY FOUND IN NORTH AMERICA. AND THEN THERE'S THE BUTTON SPIDER FROM AFRICA. FASCINATING, ISN'T IT? YEAH. YEAH. OH MY GOD! THAT'S A MADAGASCAR. - IT'S POISONOUS? - DEADLY. THAT'S MY BROTHER. HIS COWL IS MADE OUT OF SPIDER'S SILK. HE'S HERE TO REMIND ME THAT I NEED TO CHECK IN ON YOUR FRIEND. THE KARNI MATA TEMPLE, IS THAT NEAR? OH, IT'S JUST A RUMOR IN THE GUIDEBOOK, YEAH? NO, IT'S HERE. IT'S AS OLD AS THE MOUNTAINS. MAYBE WE SHOULD STAY HERE, YEAH?

I THINK SO. YEAH, I'M SURE IT IS. THEN WHERE IS IT? IT HAS TO BE HERE SOMEWHERE. THERE IT IS. THERE IT IS. BRIAN! BRIAN? BRI? BRIAN? OKAY, NOT FUNNY! I'LL BE OUTSIDE, OKAY? OKAY, BRIAN? OH, GOD. OH! OH GOD! STILL, I GOTTA SAY, MAN, IT'S BETTER THAN THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT BACK IN PHILLY. - SMELLS BETTER TOO. - NO, THAT'S JUST ME. - YOU? - YEAH. - OH MY GOD. THAT IS NOT YOU. - YOU ARE SO CHEEKY. I SMELL BETTER THAN THAT. THIS REMINDS ME OF THE BUS SERVICE IN SWAZILAND. YOU KNOW SWAZILAND? AFRICA, AFRICA. IT'S A SMALL ISLAND OFF MADAGASCAR. OH, SORRY. IT'S OKAY. SHOULD I BE OFFENDED THAT YOU DIDN'T LINGER WHEN YOU SLAMMED INTO ME? OH, I DID. IT JUST WENT QUICKLY. KAKADU, NORTHERN AUSTRALIA-- ETHIOPIA? OKAY, HELLO. HELLO. OH, GOD, WHERE AM I?

IT IS A BIT OF MESS, HUH? - MORE MISSING PHOTOS? - GINA. HARD NOT TO NOTICE, ISN'T IT? - YEAH, KIND OF. - SEE HERE? MY PREDECESSOR. MISSING FOR TWO MONTHS. - SO YOU'VE ONLY BEEN HERE FOR... - TWO WEEKS. TWO VERY LONG WEEKS. BUT THEY KEEP PUTTING ME IN POSTINGS WHERE NOBODY ELSE WANTS TO GO. - AND AS FOR YOU TWO? - OH, WE WERE ON A TREK, A WHOLE BUNCH OF US, AND ONE OF OUR GROUP GOT BIT BY A SPIDER. HUH, A SPIDER? YEAH, REAL BAD. AND WE HAD TO TAKE HER TO THIS VILLAGE, BUT SHE NEEDS SOME SERIOUS MEDICAL ATTENTION. YEAH, SO IS THERE A HELICOPTER WE CAN TAKE? - LOAD UP WITH SUPPLIES AND THEN WE CAN-- - A HELICOPTER? SORRY. I DO NOT MEAN TO BE DISRESPECTFUL. DO YOU REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE VILLAGE? UH... KAR... - KAR... - KORLI... - KARNI MATA? - YEAH. YOU KNOW IT? HE KNOWS IT. IT'S A VILLAGE MUCH TALKED ABOUT BY THE LOCALS, SHROUDED IN LOCAL COLOR AND LEGEND. BUT I HAVE BEEN SO BUSY TRYING TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THIS TOWN, I HAVE YET TO GO INTO THE JUNGLE AND LOOK AROUND. SHE WAS TREATED BY THE DOCTOR, BUT HE SAID THEY WERE GONNA NEED MORE SUPPLIES IF SHE WAS, YOU KNOW, GONNA LIVE. - SO YOUR FRIENDS ARE THERE, TOO? - YEAH. OKAY, I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

WHAT IS THAT? IT'S MY BROTHER. - BROTHER? - YEAH. HE SUFFERS FROM A SEVERE BONE DEFORMITY AND I'M TREATING HIM. THE NATIVES HERE THINK OF HIM AS A GOD BECAUSE OF IT. HE HATES CIVILIZATION. IT'S WELL-FOUNDED. YOU CAME BECAUSE OF THE GIRL? - THAT'S RIGHT. HOW IS SHE? - GONE. - DEAD? - NO, SHE'S WELL ENOUGH. THEY GOT AN EARLY START. YOU KNOW HOW THE JUNGLE CAN BE AFTER DARK. - I SEE. - IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE? WELL, YOU CAN GIVE ME MY GUN BACK. OH, OF COURSE. OH, YEAH.
