Don't even think like that okay, I'll see you at Stacey's. I'm about twenty minutes away. I'll see you there. What's going on? I don't know! How long has she actually been missing?

What's going on, where's my daughter? From what we can tell, she was taken from her bedroom through an unlocked window. That fucking window! I warned you about that window. Derek, now is not the time. Look, your friend is right, we have police blocking off all the Streets in the neighborhood, and we have more officers arriving To door-knock and help look for your daughter. Georgia! Sorry? Her name, my daughters name is Georgia. Look, we'll do all we can to find Georgia as fast as possible. Do you have a current photo of her? Stacey, how about you and me go inside and find a current Picture of Georgia? Okay? So what now, what can I do? She's six years old, mate. I have a couple of questions, if that's okay? Do you or your wife have any enemies? Stacey's not my wife, and no, I don't. I can't speak for her. Do you owe anyone large amounts of money for any reason? Yeah, the tax department, what's that got to do with anything? My daughter is gone, missing, disappeared and you're playing Twenty friggin' questions with me. Sorry, but we need to ask, the smallest thing may lead Us to finding Georgia. Look, I promise we'll do everything we can, But we'll need your help also. Derek, what's going on? Look, I'll leave you for now, we'll chat again later. I told Stacey about that fucking window. What window? Ah, you mean the broken window in Georgia's room. Yes! I thought you fixed that ages ago? Is that where they're saying she got out from? Not got out, she was taken. Georgia wouldn't climb out that window. Okay, everyone listen up. We're looking for a six year old girl. Her name is Georgia. This is the most current photo we have of Georgia. We believe she was taken from her bedroom some time between 10 pm and 4 am this morning. I would like to ask all the neighbors of this street and Neighboring streets to check in your backyards, under your Houses, in trees, sheds, and even in your homes. If she has lost her way, she will be cold and scared. If you do find her, approach her carefully, as not to startle her, And once again, radio back to base. Excuse me. Alright. I've just heard that there are severe storms coming over. So let's get out there, guys, and find this little girl, and bring Her home safely to her mum and dad. Georgia? Georgia! Georgia! Georgia! Georgia! It's Derek. Yeah? Really? Oh thank God! Yeah, yeah, I'll meet you there, okay. Did they find her, love? Yeah, Derek overheard a policeman saying they found her at fisher's point. Oh, this is great news! Oh, I told you she'd be okay! Can someone drive me there, please? Yeah, c'mon. Thank God, mate. I was so worried. I know. Little bugger. She's got some explaining to do, aye. Just as well, we caught her before the storm kicked in, mate. I'll wait here for Stacey. Georgia!!! Please join with me as we bow our heads in prayer. Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is In heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our Trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead Us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is The kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever, amen. She's just a baby. She's just a baby. It was a beautiful send off, Derek. If there's anything you need, you'd just let me know, alright? Anything I can do? I just don't understand how any of this could happen. Excuse me?! What did you just say?! What did you say? You can't understand how this happened? Derek. Are you serious, tell me you're joking! Derek, don't! Derek, that's enough. Don't you dare tell me that's enough! I told this stupid bitch time and time again About that fucking window! Go on, tell em! Fuck off! This is not my fault. Come on mate, calm down. No you can all just piss off! I'm sick of always being the bad guy. I offered to fix that window so many times, But you, yes you, wouldn't let me. So because of your stupidity and your stubbornness My daughter is dead. So don't you dare stand there and say, how could this happen? I could tell you exactly how this happened. Come on mate, you've said your piece. I haven't even started to say my piece. Come on, let's go for a walk. Yeah well, we were all thinking it. It's not my fault. It's not my fault. God, baby, I miss you so much. I miss you too daddy. Sorry. I'm so sorry I wasn't there to protect you. It's okay daddy. It's not your fault. You know I love you very much. To the moon and back. That's right. We say that to each other all the time, don't we? Oy! Oy Derek, wake up. C'mon champ, this has got to stop. Shit mate, not you too. Why don't you all give me time, I've only just lost my daughter. I have a pretty good excuse. I know you have, but all you do is stay trapped in this house. Every time I come around, that TV is bloody blaring. Surprised the neighbors haven't complained. Not as easy as you think. She comes and visits me every night. What do you mean she comes and visits you every night? I'm not sure if they're dreams or real. They seem so real when she's here. We just lay here and talk. They're just dreams, my friend. Look, did you go to that group I told you about? What group? Oh, the grieving parents thing. No, I didn't. Are you gonna go? Thinking about it. You should mate. They'll be able to help you through this. It'll be awesome, you'll see. Now get yourself up, we're going for a surf today. Yeah ok, let's go for a surf. Do you want me to call Tommy, see if he's keen as well? I haven't seen him since the funeral, so I really couldn't Give a shit if he comes or not. Thanks col, I needed this. Any time mate, you know that. Georgia loved coming here and having a swim. Do you remember the time she ran down To the water and fell flat on her face? Well, that's one more thing she won't ever do again. Listen, are you going to that meeting tonight? What meeting? You know exactly what meeting. Look I'm happy to come along with you if you want. It'll be good for you. I think you might be right. Might do me some good. So you're going, then? If it means you'll leave me the hell alone, then yes, I'll go. You're sure you don't want me to come with you? Thanks, but I think I'll go on my own, just listen in. Cool. Georgia, is that you? Georgia? Georgia, is that you honey? Hello daddy! Hello. Hey mate, how you going? Hey tom, I'm getting there. Haven't heard from you since the funeral. Yeah sorry, I just had to deal with it my own way, you know? Yeah, I understand, seen mum and dad lately? Yeah, I was over there last night. I think they're coming around to see you, check up on how you're going. Mum said you really upset Tanya. Yeah, I'll have to call Tanya. Was a bit of a prick to her when she came over, forgot about that. Sian okay? Sian was fine, mate, she understood. That's good. Tell her sorry for me. Will do. Hey, I'm having a party this Saturday arvo. I want you to come over and have a beer with me. I dunno, mate. I don't think I really want to be around people right now, you know. Oh, bullshit! You can't live your life like a hermit forever, bro! Just, come over for a few hours. There'll be some talent here, I promise. Yeah, I'll think about it. What time's this shindig kicking off anyway? Ah, starting at four, the barbecue. You better come, I'll be pissed off it you don't. We'll see how I'm going. Anyway, I better get ready for work. I appreciate you calling Tommy, means a lot to me. You know I love you, little brother. I love you too, bro. See you Saturday. Oy! See you Saturday, right? Okay, fair enough. I'll let you know. Yeah, yeah, I'll annoy you again in a few days. Later mate. Yeah, bye. I'm losing my shit. Hey mate, how you goin'? Morning. I'm getting the mackenzie job done. I finished the patch job on that one over there, But I cant find their job card. Oh, that's okay. That's the feltch's board. Card for that's in the office. You okay? What do you mean, am I okay? Because I'm working, there must be something wrong? Didn't mean to offend you, mate. You just seem a little different, that's all. Did you go to that meeting last night? Those meetings are intense; Not sure I really want to go back. I had to listen to this guy talk about his daughter. Are you still having dreams about Georgia? I got a call from Tommy this morning. Oh yeah, what's the long lost brother up to now? He's having a party this weekend. Wants me to come. Probably needs someone to cook the food. Ah, look I think that's a great idea. You should go. One, you'll get to spend some time with your little brother, And two, it might actually take your mind off things. You never know, you'll probably have fun. I dunno, Tommy's parties are always over the top. I think it'd be great. And look, if it gets too much, then just leave. Yeah, stuff it. I will go. Be good to catch up with tom and sian again, And have a quiet beer. There you go! Now can you turn the power back on so we can make some money, And get the ato off our backs? No worries, if you need me I'll be out in front. Hello? Colin, it's detective Harris here. Can I speak to Derek please? Yeah I'll just get him for you. Derek! That's detective Harris on the phone. Hello? Hello Derek, this is detective Harris here, how are you? Good, do you have some news for me yet? Well, we have no new suspects, but we're getting lots of calls From the public, people are starting to come forward With new information. So have any of those callers given you any information that Actually helps the case? Ya know, this has been going on for over six months now, And you say the same thing every time. Look I understand you're frustrated, it can be hard work Sifting through all the information we're getting, But I really believe we're starting to get somewhere. We have one caller recently mention seeing a man, Maybe early thirties, leaving fisher's point around three A.M. We're getting the man to do a sketch up of what he saw, but it Was dark, so I'm not sure we'll get an accurate description. Well I appreciate your efforts Michael, But as usual, I won't hold my breath. Look I'll give you a call when we get the sketch up and ready. You can come in and have a look, you never know, It could be a solid lead. Yep, thanks for the call. Bye. Any news? Same shit, different day. They're useless pricks, that's all I can say. I'm sorry mate, this'll break, I can feel it. Someone will give this fucker away, you'll see. Yeah, I've had enough for today, I'm going home to relax. I'll finish this tomorrow. That's okay, I'll look after the jobs for today. Look, I'll give you a call tomorrow, Maybe go for a surf or something? Sounds like a plan. Call me in the morning. - See ya later. - See ya mate. Sorry about that. Hey! I was just about to call you, and here you are. Just sneaking off before anyone knew I was here. What, you can't leave yet, you only just got here.

Oy! What? You can be so rude sometimes! Sorry! What's for dinner? We're having steak and sausages. And I'm going to start cooking soon. Kinky little fucker. What the hell is going on here? Hey man, what are ya doin'? Ah I was laying down, then I remembered Stacey was going to Send me some pictures of Georgia to my email. So I was hoping to check it. If that's okay with you. Yeah, that's cool dude. Save some to my desktop as well. Alright, after you've done that, get your arse out here And have a brew with me. Tommy! Tommy, where are you? Yeah, I'm coming. Shit, settle down. Bloody women, aye. Hey, if you're not out there in five minutes I'll have to drink 'em all on me own. Yeah, I'll be there, let me check my email. Alright. Derek are you still in there? Hey! Tommy said you had an email from Stacey with some pictures of Georgia? Was wondering if I could have a look? Ah, I wish, she hasn't sent them yet. Ah, that sucks. Feeling any better? Not really. Think I might go home and go to sleep. Okay, I understand. C'mon, I'll take you out the back so Tommy doesn't corner You for another drink. That'd be good. Think he needs a sleep as well. Uh huh. Just give me a sec. Yeah, take your time. I first met Ben at the beach when he was doing nippers. Ben is a good looking kid, but on the cheeky side. When I was younger, my dad would beat me If I didn't do what I was told. I warned Ben one day that he would get into trouble If he didn't stop it. Of course, Ben wouldn't listen to me. Don't worry dad, I showed him. Today was shit at work. Colin's really pissing me off With all his nagging. Derek just stands there and let's him do it. I had to release some pressure. Derek? Derek? You alright, mate? Sorry, I was off with the fairies. Yeah, you seemed to be. Are you here to see me? No, I was walking past and had a moment, I guess. What've you got there, mate? What, this? Just book work for the surf shop. Never ends, aye. Speaking of book work, I've got that sketch for you, If you wanna come in and see it? Is it okay if I come back through the week? I've got a lot on today. Sure, no problem. I can drop it down to the store, if you like. Ah, that's right, I'm taking off for a week. We can do it when I get back. You sure? I can go and get it. It'll only take a few minutes. No, I don't have time today. I've got to run. Look, I'll call you when I get back. Alright, I'll talk to you in a week or so, I guess. Here's one for ya: Did you hear that story about the Fella on the farm that chopped his arm off, And to stop the bleeding, he used a hot iron? Is that really possible? If the iron's super hot, yeah. You could try cauterizing the wound to stop the bleeding. Probably destroy the tissue though. Plus it'd hurt like hell! Must have been a brave man. Wouldn't someone pass out from the pain though? The human body can withstand so much pain. Most of us will never have to go through what we're Truly capable of handling. Thank God. Hey doc, I was watching YouTube the other day and I saw this Footage of a dentist in Germany or something... He was smoking and looked to be drunk. He was pulling this guy's teeth out, and jeeze it looked brutal. Yes, I've seen that one. That is without doubt the roughest dental work I've ever seen. Ah, the guy in the chair was losing so much blood, Surely it wouldn't have happened like that, Or he could have at least stopped the bleeding? Well, there are right ways and wrong ways to extract a tooth. Naturally, we use the proper tools to do it. For example, ah let's see, this one here is designed to get down Inside the gum. And ah this little baby, which just happens to be my favorite, Is designed to pull the tooth out. How about the days where people were tortured though? They didn't have all this fancy equipment we have today to keep People awake, or alive for that matter. It's all about conditioning, mate. Conditioning? What the hell are you talking about, you piss head? Well, you know how, ah, you go for a run and On the first day you run a "k." Yeah? Yeah, and if you ran every other day you'd be able To run further, right? For sure. Yeah, so torturing someone's the same. It's all about conditioning the person's pain threshold. What they used to do was push you to the limit Where you'd be about to pass out, then stop. Then come back the next day and push you even further. It's really a mental tug of war between your brain and the pain. Eventually they'd pass out, though. Well, how would you wake 'em up if they did pass out? Its not overly hard, you can get products over the counter to do that. Smelling salts have been around since at least the seventeenth Century to help revive a person that's passed out. And they work because the ammonia gas irritates the lungs And triggers and inhalation reflex. Which then wakes you up, easy as! Sounds like it. Welcome! Hey, yeah, it's been a while. Another beer, mate? Does a bear shit in the woods? What, have you been throwing down a few? Ah, I'm on me fourth. So, when's the misses get back? I dunno. Five, six days, maybe a week. Party time at your place? Hell yeah, hasn't stopped mate. Home brew's the best. Cheers. So, how you going, mate? You coping with it all okay? Yeah, I'd feel a lot better if they just caught the fucker. Yeah. Are the cops even doing anything? It just seems like they have no leads at all. Yeah, that's the problem. They have no clue. I don't think they'll ever catch who did this. They said they had no forensic evidence. All they have is some old bastard Who saw someone around three A.M. But detective Harris reckons nothing will come of that Because it was too dark to get a good look at the guy. Shit, that sucks mate. So did the old guy say anything about what he saw? Only that the guy he saw looked to be late twenties, early Thirties, but nothing will come of it. This bastard will get away with it. Slow down there, turbo, you don't wanna injure yourself. Mate, I'll drink you under the table any day of the week. How about you show me this pool room, and I'll kick your arse. You're on. Jeeze, strong brews mate! You alright there? Yeah I'm good, just a little dizzy, that's all. Is that going to be your excuse when I smash ya? You wish mate. You're okay, just take your time. Tommy, you can't move. You're bolted down to the table. Oh, I've performed a tracheotomy on you So you can't talk either. It's amazing what you can learn on the net these days. The only way you can talk is if I block that hole. I wouldn't go throwing your head around either. There are pretty sharp spikes pointed at your skull. I reckon it'd hurt a lot if you hit em'. Now, what are you trying to say? What are you doing? Ah! Come off it tom, don't act like you don't know! If you tell me the truth right now, I'll let you go. Truth about what? I'm going to give you one more chance to tell me the truth. This is it. If the next words outta' your mouth are not what I want to hear, well fuck ya then. So you wanna confess? What have I done? You know what pisses me off the most About having a pool table? People always spill crap on them and wreck the felt. Look what you have done, Tommy. You are bleeding on my table. Shit. Well now I have to stop the bleeding. I did it. You did what? I killed her. I have your diary, I know exactly what you did to my Daughter, you sick prick. She was six years old. You killed Georgia because you where mad at Colin and me. What the fuck is wrong with you? And she wasn't the only one. You're a child killer, rapist, pedophile. You're scum! Don't bother Tommy. I cut out your throat So I didn't have to listen to your dribble. How old was Georgia? She was six. For every year she was alive you're going to get tortured For a whole day. Six years equals six days. And when I say tortured, I mean I'm going to cause you so Much fucking pain you'll wish you were never born! You are not my brother! The only thing I wanna hear coming out of your mouth is you Yelling from the pain I'm causing you. That looks like it's pretty painful. That should hold you down for a while. I'm going to see Colin. You just stay there, and I'll be back soon. You seem in good spirits today! Do I? That week off seems to have done you a world of good. What'd you get up to? I rebuilt my pool room. Looks good now. So we're on for a pool comp soon then? Hell yeah! I'm ordering new felt for the old girl next week. Once I have that, we'll get into it. So, when're you coming back to the shop? Hmm, give me a few more days. I have a few things to finish up. Then I'm all yours. Good to have you back, mate. Take all the time you need. Now I have a story for you Tommy. I really don't think you're going to wanna hear it, But I'm going to tell you anyway. It's about that little boy in england. Five year old that was taken from the shopping centre. Did you ever hear about that little boy? Ah, it's a sad story really. This little boy was shopping with his mother. Then the next thing you know, he's gone. Taken by two ten year old boys. They took him down to the train tracks And did the most horrific things to him. They even cut off his fingers. When I read this, Tommy, after losing Georgia, I really felt for that family. So for the sake of justice I'm gonna cut off your fingers. One at a time. Hold that thought! Nearly forgot the wax! Need to make sure this wax is melted So you don't bleed everywhere. This will be a lot easier if you don't move. Okay, okay! I've stopped. I don't know why you're upset. I only cut off two of your fingers! Now the wax is to stop the bleeding... But it won't stick with all this blood. Let's get you cleaned up. Good timing! Mum's calling. Mother! Nah, just waxing some stuff. Yeah sure, what time where you thinking? Okay cool. See ya then, yeah... I better finish this waxing. I love you too. Mum and dad are coming to visit. I better get organized. Don't worry, I'll bring you down some food. Can't have you starving to death on me. I got a call from that detective the other day. What did he have to say? It's been nearly six months. Not too much as usual, apparently some old guy saw Someone around three a, m, walking out of fishers point. Although it was dark, the cops are getting a sketch artist to Draw up a picture of what the old fart saw. Don't say that. Hey dad, do you remember That girl that was killed, uh, shit, like twelve years ago on The coast, the young girl? Alison karney. Is that who you mean? Yeah, that's the one, what'd they do to her killer in jail again? Jeeze son, I can't really remember. Hang on, just gotta put my washing in the dryer. Be back in a second. Gotta love clothes dryers. I was just saying that we should get going, Your father wants to watch the footy. I just remembered what they did to that guy in prison. Really? Hey, Tommy you awake? I was just chatting with dad upstairs, and He told me what he wants me to do to you for killing Georgia. So tomorrow we'll do dad's idea, just to make him happy. You know how he's always gotta throw his two Bob's worth in. Righto, well I'm off to bed. We have a big day tomorrow. What'd you say? Just kill me. Oh, I will kill you mate, don't you worry about that. Everything you did to Georgia will come back ten fold, Starting tomorrow. Sleep well. Do you want me to leave this or take it out? Leave it. I can't hear you properly. You want me to twist it a little? It's kinda weird, but okay! Aye? Night bro! Hey Tommy! Check this out. Guess where this is going to go. What? No idea? Up your arse, mate! Hey, don't panic! I have lube. You don't think I'd just ram it up there, do you? Now your probably wondering why I wanna stick a pipe up your Arse right? Well that's where this comes into it. See I'm going to stick the barbed wire up the pipe and into Your guts. Then I'm going to remove the tube and leave it up there. You excited? I am! I told you we had a big day ahead of us. I enjoyed killing her... What'd you say about Georgia? Oh God, I'm sorry. I hope this fucking hurts, you little prick. Oh, this is sharp shit. I bet you wish I used lube now. Please Derek, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. We seem to be stuck! I wonder if it's your guts. Or if it's the pipe. Hey Colin! How's business? Yeah, things are picking up. What can I do for you? I'm just here to see Derek. We have a sketch for him to look at. Ah yeah he mentioned you had a witness or something. He's not actually in today, he's got a few days off. Ah, we'll find him at home then? Definitely. He's working on a pool room. Really good for him. Giving him something to do, you know. That's great. Uh, actually, While we're here, could you have a look at this sketch? Sure, anything to help. You know who that is, don't you? Thanks for your help. Come on, wake up, Tommy. Oy Tommy, can you hear me? Oh thank God! I thought I might have lost you there for a minute. Might have pushed you a bit hard yesterday... What doesn't kill you, right? Can't have you nodding off and missing everything. Yep, might have to do that in sections, mate. While we wait, how about we read a little? Recognize this? There are three stories in here I think we need To seriously discuss, don't you? And to save us time I've highlighted the important parts. Let's talk about little Ben. He was ten years old, Tommy. What would make any man want to hurt a ten year old boy? Do you know I've met Ben's older sister? Let me tell you, she is pissed off. She'd cause you a lot of pain too, but well, she can't be here, So I guess I'll need to do it for her. Now you say you broke his knees so he couldn't run away. Well, I did some research on knee breaking. And I thought you'd appreciate this! I found the plans on Google. The knee splitter. So for little Ben and his older sister, I made one just for you. What's say we try this baby out? Don't you dare pass out, you coward! You can handle it! Ben was ten years old when you smashed his knee caps! It's all about conditioning, remember? You can take it! You think this is bad? Wait 'til you see whats coming, this is nothing tom! I loved you, you were my brother, and all along you were The worst scum of the earth. You fucking disgust me. You still have two days left to pay for what you did. You piece of shit! Suck it up! Are you doing bad stuff to Uncle Tommy? Yes baby, I'm teaching him a lesson. Uncle Tommy is a bad man. Does it make you feel happy to hurt Uncle Tommy? No baby, hurting people is bad, But sometimes really bad people deserve to be punished. Daddy, you said when people are bad to call the policeman, and The policeman will put them in jail. I just want Uncle Tommy to never forget What he has put us through, Then daddy will call the police. Promise? Yes baby, I promise. I love you, daddy. I love you too, baby girl. I come down here to give you a drink And look what you've done to yourself, Tommy. Seriously Houdini, what's the plan of attack here? Shred your last good hand getting loose, then you have to Free your head from those spikes, which is pretty bloody hard even For me, and I made the fucker! After all that, you have to free your ankles. Then what? Run out of here on a broken knee with two feet of barbed wire Sticking out of your arse? How the fuck did you get away with murder? Mmm. That's right, you didn't. Well I guess this hand's gotta go! Please, Derek. Don't bother! Who the hell is that? Some people have bad timing. Might be around the back? Okay, okay, settle down, I'm comin'. Ah Michael, how's things? Morning Derek, sorry to bother you. Got a few minutes? Yeah sure, come in. Excuse the mess. Sit down guys, you want a coffee or something? Ah, no thanks. We won't hold you up. We called into the store to see you, but, ah, Colin said you were having a few days off. Yeah that's right, taking a few more days, Then heading back in next week. So what's this about, do you have some news for me? Actually I think we might, we called into the surf shop Yesterday to show you this. When Colin saw it, he thought it looked exactly like your Brother Thomas. Detective Harris! Detective Harris I guess it looks like Tommy a little. Wait, you don't think Tommy's the guy who did this? Well, no, but we certainly would like to talk to him. We dropped into his house the other day, but he wasn't there. You heard from him at all lately? Derek, have you heard from him? Um no, no, um, Tommy does his own thing. Although mum and dad did ask me the other night When they were over if I'd seen him. I think he went away with his girlfriend. She's a photographer and had a job out west. I tried to call her but she had no reception. Fair enough. Do you know when they're getting back? Saturday or Sunday I believe? Okay well, I think that's all we need for now. Oh, um, if you do hear from your brother, Tell him to give me a call. Now, let's talk about kelsie. What'd she ever do to you? What was it about her that made you take her out to The bush to rape and kill her? The part that really gets me is that you had a beautiful Girlfriend and you chose to rape a fifteen year old girl. And to think, sian said she'd want you in jail. Pedophiles get what? Couple of years, then they're let out to do it again? Not really effective, is it? Perhaps you'd like to see what it feels like to be raped? Pease Derek. Did that hurt? Did that hurt? If you don't answer me, I'll do it again! Did that hurt? Yes! Now you know how kelsie felt! I see our conditioning is coming along quite well. Might be time to push it up a notch. There was a little boy in Western Australia that was Beaten by his stepfather. Ya' know how he did it? He put the phone book on him, like this. Then beat him with a hammer. Now you can't tell me that hurt. I think you can take more! Now that's gotta hurt! I bet you're finding it hard to breathe! I need a break, Tommy! This is hard work! You have a rest. We have a lot to get to In the next 24 hours. Tomorrow we talk about Georgia, but today, Well, today it's about kelsie. I have a question for you Tommy. You going to tell me the truth? Water! Sure, but then you'll tell me what I wanna know. Deal? Yes. That's enough. Now as you can tell, I have a hammer, And this time there is no phone book. You mess me around I'll crack you with this hammer. Where is kelsie's body? Speak. The old cane shed, just off the high way. We used to play there as kids. So if I was to call the cops right now and tell them To head out there, they'll find her body, right? Yes, buried under an old steel pile. That wasn't so hard, and I didn't have to hit you. That's for raping and killing her! I have some information on a missing 15 year old girl, Her name is kelsie Taylor, her body can be found under a pile Of steel behind an old cane shed just off the Bruce highway. North of the sunshine coast. You can't miss the cane farm. Good luck. Look at the master at work. What're you building, Georgia? A sand castle. Maybe we could live there one day? No we cant, silly Billy. Why can't we live there? Because it's made out of sand! You're so smart baby. How much do you love daddy? Daddy, you know how much! Now, leave it, leave it! Leave you, the professional. "I opened her window and climbed inside." I knew about the window from Derek telling me how Stacy Wouldn't let him fix it. I picked up Georgia out of her bed. She woke slightly and I told Her it's okay, it's Uncle Tommy. Go back to sleep. I climbed out the window with her. She woke again and I said we were going to see her dad And for her to go back to sleep. I took her up the road to my car and laid her on the back seat. I don't know why, Georgia. I didn't really want to take her, but I was so angry at Derek For firing me and choosing her and Colin over me. I wanted to get him back. I took her down to the beach. I knew she loved the beach. My intention was to drown her, But she woke up and started crying. I couldn't shut her up. She kept asking for her father over and over again. No matter what I said to calm her it was always, 'I want my daddy, Uncle Tommy I want my daddy.' Drove me insane. "So I hit her." You sat there every day saying how much you loved Georgia And our family. I can't believe such lies came out of your mouth. So that's what we're going to start with first. What are you going to do? Before I couldn't hear you scream, Now I can hear every noise you make. That's for all the bullshit you dribbled to me, My daughter, and my family. I think it's time this has to go. You took my daughter's right hand... An eye for an eye. No! No! Please Derek, I'm sorry! Hey mate. - I got him, mate. - Got who? Holy shit, Derek, what have you done? Tommy, Tommy can you hear me? What the fuck happened here? We need to call an ambulance. Forget him col, he's dying now. This fucker got what he deserved. Are you insane? We need to get help now, and if you don't, I will. Fuck! This fucker killed Georgia. He deserves everything he gets. And if you continue to annoy me I'll cut your fucking head off. You understand me? I understand mate, he deserves it, I didn't realize. Sorry please, please, just let me go. Go on, get out. Col... Call mum and dad for me. Fuck, fuck... Harris, it's Colin. Derek's got Tommy and he's killing him. Slow down, slow down, I don't understand. What do you mean, "he's killing him?" He's got Tommy locked in the pool room, My God, it's a fucking mess down there. Okay, how do you know this? 'Cause he tried to cut my fucking head off! Are you still in the house? No, he let me go. He told me to leave. Good. Stay out the front, on the street. Do not go back in the house, we will be there in a minute. Time to die, bro. Derek, please. Please. I gotta go. That's detective Harris here now. I've got to go speak to him. I don't know whats happened, Tanya. Just give your mum a call, and I'll see you when you get here. Okay. See ya. Bye. Colin, are you okay? Have you got any other injuries? Look, I'm fine, you better get down there. Tommy's in a bad way. Derek thinks he killed Georgia. Okay, calm down. Listen to me, is he armed? Armed? Does he have a weapon? Ah, he's got a knife. Okay, is Tommy still alive? Look, put it this way, if you don't get down there now, He's gonna kill him. Alright, you stay with detective Johnson. Sit in the car. I need you to sit in the car. Hold that on your neck and calm down. Sam, call for back-up and make sure they're on their way. I'm going in to talk to Derek. Derek, don't leave me like this, just kill me. Derek! Don't do anything stupid, mate! I'm coming down! Stay there. I mean it. Stay where you are. Go! Clear! Go! No, Tommy, I'll do my time for torturing you, But you will always be the murderer in this family. Oy Tommy, don't die mate, help's on the way. Jail's next for you. They'll love you in there. Don't! It's over. Clear! I know mate. Go! Clear! Covering! The victim's downstairs. Georgia: Uncle Tommy's down there. Clear! I love you, daddy. To the moon and back, baby. To the moon and back.
