- Oh we're gonna be so late. Mom, your name tag. - Oh gosh. - Where's your long sleeve? - I'll get changed as soon as I get registered. Come here. I love you. - I'll see you tomorrow night. - Drive carefully kiddo. - I will mom. You're gonna be late. What? - I'm sure glad you're my girl. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. - I love you too. you forgot your hat. - Hey. - Hey. - Thanks for coming. - Oh Mick, I'm so sorry. How's Laurel? - She's hanging in there. - This is so terrible. - Yeah, we're all still pretty shook up. - What about Robin's daughter? - Jessie. She must be devastated. I don't know that it's quite landed yet. - I am so sorry Laurel, your sister was a great friend. We're all gonna miss her. - Thank you. You ready to go, Jessie? Where is she going? - I'll see. - No horses. - Not for a while, no. Remember when we came out that summer? Gosh, when was that, and we went on a trail ride to uh... - Pine Meadow. - Yeah, Pine Meadow. That was fun. You go back there ever? - Not since mom started competing again. Maybe we could board some. - What's that? - Horses. - Yeah, maybe. It really hurts, huh? - Does it ever go? - It, uh, it eases over time. But peace will come. Hey, why don't we go inside? Hey, it's all right. It's okay kiddo. We're gonna make it through this. You're gonna live , I promise you that. - I have to go back to the house tomorrow and bring the keys to the bank. Do you wanna ride with me? You could grab your car or anything else that's left. - You got wheels now? - Mom found a really sweet deal. What is it? - I don't know, old. But it does this thing like when it rains the radio turns on by itself. - Well that's different. - I just keep the knob turned down. - Have you checked your headlight fluid? - You mean blinker fluid? - Yeah, that's what I mean. The blinker fluid. How about I take a look at it? Hey, I can do this. Why don't you go sit down a while and relax. - It's okay. - Should have seen how she grabbed hold of me, like she's drowning. I wish we could have been there for her growing up. - Mick, we did all we could, it just wasn't meant to be. - I know it. It's just she's here now with us, and I can't, I won't let her down. - When's the last time you let anybody down, hmm? - What about you? You doing okay? - I'll be all right. - Really? These things got a way of sneaking up on you. - It sure makes you think. - Hey, don't worry, you ain't gonna lose me. What are you doing? Don't choke. - Taking precautions. - You're silly. - Five bags total? - Yeah, five will do it today. Mick, how are you? - Hey, Jim, been a while. - Yeah. You're working here now? And they got you loading feed? - Whatever keeps me busy. - No kidding. How you like it? - Living the dream, living the dream. Seriously Jim, I'm just glad to have something to get us through, you know? - Well you do what you gotta do. - That you do. Good seeing you buddy. - You too. And say hi to the family. - I'll do that, thanks. I'm sorry you had to switch your last year, that's really tough. - It's okay. - So what comes after graduation? Have you thought about college? - College? - Yeah. I mean not that you'd have to, but it's always an option. - Oh I'm pretty sure I know what I wanna do. - Barrel racing? - Mm-hmm. - What about nursing? It's really stable, good pay. There's never enough nurses in the world. - I don't really wanna be a nurse. - Okay. But I mean have you at least explored other options, you know besides barrel racing? Just do me a favor and at least look at other options. - Yeah, I can do that. Sorry, I can't remember the name. - Roscoe. - Roscoe. Looking for Gus. - He should be right over there. If you hustle you might catch him. You know how quick he moves. - All right, thanks. - You bet. Miss working for you, Mick. - Well hey, then put in a good word for me, will you? Well Gus, you know I can buck logs with the best of 'em, and I know the management side, so I can pitch in there too, it's a win/win. - We're full up Mick. Since you guys started the layoffs we've had our pick. - Well then you got some pretty good guys, didn't you? - Indeed we did. - Well, you know, given my experience with them very same fellas, and my track record, I'd fit right in. - I'm sorry, Mick, there's just no room for you here. - I understand. All right. No worries. Gus, listen, if something does come up you'll give me a holler, huh? - Sure, Mick, sure. By the way, say hi to Laurel for me, will you? - Yeah, you bet. - Jessie, is there anything else you can think of? - There's a couple things in the barn, I'll just grab them, you can go on ahead. - Are you doing okay? We can always come back for your car if you wanted. - No, that's fine. I'll see you at the house. - We have 12 more horses coming in next week so make sure we account for that with the feed. - He got out again? Didn't someone fix the gate? - Yeah, I thought we did. Hello, I found this guy near the road. - Oh my gosh, thank you so much. - Of course. - He's turning into quite the Houdini, this one. - What a beautiful horse. - He better be for $90,000. So what's your story? You live in the area? - Not too far. I live with Mick and Laurel, they're my aunt and uncle. - I'm Amber. Jessie. - Let me know if there's anything I can do. - Well actually I'm looking for a job, do you know anyone who's hiring? - Why don't you stop by next week and we can talk about it. - Okay. Just come here? - Yeah, I'm usually around. - All right, thanks. I might have a job. - Oh really? - At the horse farm around the corner. - Amber's Place. - Yeah, AMber's the one I met. We're gonna talk about it. - Well that would be great if you got a job right off. - Just good luck. - It's more than that. - Seems to me though a cowgirl might feel out of place over there. - Not this cowgirl. So what's the pay? - Don't know. - Long as it keeps you around horses, huh? Yep. - Yeah. Well this has all the ear markings of a Laurel casserole. Except something's missing. Cheese? - I'm trying something different, it's called left over casserole. - Ah, new family favorite. And remarkably it changes every time. - Hey you, you're welcome to sit here if you want. Kenzie. - Jessie. Nice to meet you. - Do you want me to show you around a bit? - No, that's okay. I'm sure I can figure it out. - What is it? - Who are those guys? - Oh, they're all like into rodeos and such. - What are you into? - Bugs. - What do you mean? - Like collecting them. - Oh. What kind of bugs? - Anything really. Like have you ever heard of the ambush bug? - No. - They literally ambush other bugs and eat them. It's so interesting. They like yellow flowers and black-eyed Susans. I could find one for you if you would like. - No, that's okay. - Okay. - Kenzie? - Huh? - Thanks for asking me to sit with you. - Sure. Hey, there you are. - What's up? - Nothing. Except what you doing Friday night? - I don't know. Why? - Laurel works late, and I thought maybe we could go in and catch us a rodeo. Sound fun? - Yeah, let's do that. - Kyle? - Hey Mick. - I thought that was you, what are you doing? - I'm working on an article for the Exponent. That's MSU, right? - Uh-huh. - Good for you. College man now. Oh, you remember my niece, Jessie. - Oh my gosh, it's been years. - Yeah, like five. - You back for a visit? - Nah, she's with us now. - Well I better go, get out of your guys' way. - Hey, don't be a stranger. We should have you over for a game of Rook. - If you still like losing. - We'll see who loses. - Let's make it happen. - You bet. - He's a good guy. Up, up, up. Shoulders back. Count your steps. - Hello, Amber? Jessie, I found your horse. We were gonna talk about possible work. - Oh, right. It's not a great time, Jessie. - Oh, I'm sorry, I can come back. - No, just give me a sec. No problem. - Shoulders back, shoulders back. Count your steps. Why don't you take over for a minutes. Let's go someplace quiet. They're not pets. They're mostly thoroughbreds and they can definitely be a handful. - I can handle that. - So what's the number one rule of horses? - Always get back on. - I was gonna say don't pay too much for an Arabian. But that works. - Oh. - It's not glamorous. Most of it's gonna be mucking out stalls and stacking hay bales. I expect you to work. Does that sound like something you'd like? - Yes, that sounds great. - Okay then. Welcome to the team. - Well I don't know what Dusty told you, but he was my son's horse. As a two year old we started him on cut and training. Man, he was athletic. Seemed to love every bit of it, until one day he just gave it up, started shaking all over, wouldn't even move. I've never seen anything like it. - Yeah, Dusty said he wasn't much more than a pasture ornament. Can he be rode? - I supposed that depends on what you're gonna do with him. He's pretty darn spooky. - So what happened? - My son just pushed him too hard. He might be all right eventually for trail riding or pleasure riding. But for cutting, completely useless. So what's his name? - His name's Lucky. $500, he's yours. - Laurel. - Mick. - Grab your shoes, come on outside. - Why? - You know that feeling you get where something's planned out for you, and everything just falls together? - What are you talking about? - I may have found a horse for Jessie. - Oh. - I figured we could go tomorrow and pick him up. - Mick, we can't afford a horse. - I may have raided the cash jar. - Honey, that was for you. - I don't need another rifle. I haven't been this excited about something in a long time. It just feels so right. I mean she's our baby girl now. - It's just... - Come on, ain't you a little excited? - Every time I hear her talking about barrel racing I just hear Robin's voice in her, spending her whole life chasing a dream. And for what? - It's just a horse. - It's not. That's a lie. Is that what you want for her, Mick? - She lost her mom, honey. She needs something to hold onto. - I'm just scared for her. I just can't wish that away. - I know you are. And you got such a big heart, but I'm asking you here to be brave. This has to be from you as much as it is from me. If not, we don't. What should we do? - This is the second time we've had to speak about this issue. I don't like it anymore than you do. I'm not trying to spoil anybody's fun, but we have rules for a reason. Let's end the year on a good note. Get through it and you can live however you like outside my school. Understood? Good. You can go. - Thank you, sir. - And take that stupid hat off. - Well looky here, a bug. Come on man, I found it first. - It's not yours. - So? - So it's not very nice. - Loser. - Punk kid. - It's ruined. - So are you gonna introduce me to your friend? - Who? Oh this is Jessie, Jessie this is Blaze. - Thanks, that was nice. - No big deal. So what's your story? - Do you rodeo? - Yes I do, do you ride? - My mom did. - But not you? - I can ride. - I bet you can. - I gotta get to class. - You should really come see me ride some time, it gets pretty wild. Yeah? Or maybe you should watch me ride. Maybe I will. - Come in. - Hey, what you doing? - Nothing. You wanna come outside and see something? - What is it? - You gotta come find out. He's yours. - Where did he come from? - Found it through Dusty. He's bred for cutting, but he got spooked pretty bad in training. He swears up and down he's useless, but I think with a steady hand and a steady heart we can make it so that just ain't so. What do you think, Jessie? You up for this? - Oh, yeah. All right, well care and feeding's gonna be up to you. Can you handle that? - Uh-huh. All right. - He's beautiful. Kind of short though. - So are you. All right let's show him his new home. What's his name? - Believe it or not they called him Lucky. I think it just might finally fit, but you can call him whatever you like. - Lucky. Welcome home. - You might wanna think about what you can do to put him to work. I think I have an idea. - I have something for you. - Laurel. - It means a lot to me, so take good care of it, okay? - Thank you. - Well, don't you wanna saddle him up? - Yes. Jessie, are you in here? - Hey, what's up? - Think fast. This is not a club. - Mine. - Ready? - I'll get him saddled. - Easy. Easy. Easy. Don't push him too hard. Ease into it. Uncle Mick, I have done this before. - I know you have, but he hasn't. He's got a long way to go. Nice. All right, let him stretch it out. Kind of athletic. Yeah. - All right, keep him moving. Don't forget, quiet hands make for a quiet horse. - Mom said that. - Well she was right. It's the same for barrels as it for cutting. Horse gets his cues from you. Well hello there. Gosh, that time already? - Actually I'm a little late, sorry. - It's not a problem at all. - Late for what? - You're not playing? - Playing what? - Rook of course. Didn't knock over any barrels. Oh, hey, nice hat. - Thanks. - You're about the only person I know that has worse luck with these things. At least I'm good for something, huh? We still good on trade? - You get this thing running, I'll deliver that hay myself. Awful good thing you guys are doing taking in your niece like that. - Well that's kind of you to say so, Bob, I appreciate it. Let's see what we can do about this thing, huh? You okay, Mick? - Just a little light headed. - Let me get you a drink of water. - What's wrong? Where you off to? - An old friend I ran into at work called and said he wanted to talk business. Does this look business? Hold still. - You look great. I gotta go. - Not without this. There. - All right, wish me luck. - Good luck. - Jessie. Something's happened. Mick's in the ER. - What? What happened? - I don't know, I'm going there now. I'll call you later, okay? - Laurel. - Jessie, I'm so sorry. I was gonna call you but my phone died. - What's going on? - They don't really know, but he's been moved from the ER to a long term room. - Long term? - He lost his vision while he was driving. - What? - Yeah. He didn't hit anyone, thank God. - How does that happen? - They're saying he had a blood clot in his brain. - But... - Jessie, don't worry, he's gonna be okay. They're saying maybe just a couple weeks and he'll be back on his feet. He's gonna be okay. We'll go back in the morning, okay? - Okay. - Jessie, you can go in now. - Please don't leave me. - Hey Jessie, a little birdie told me you've been racing. Hey, what's going on? It's okay, you can tell me. - My uncle's in the hospital. - Gosh, that's terrible. Come here. - Kyle. I brought you guys some dinner. It's from my mom. - That's really sweet. - She says there's more coming. How you doing? I'm so sorry, Jess. I wish there was more I could do. - Kyle. Hi. It's from my mom. - Tell her thank you. - If there's any way I can help, just let me know. - You doing okay? Well I was gonna find something sappy to watch, I need a good cry. - I could go for that. I just have to put Lucky away. - Okay. - We had another race planned, I don't know what to do. - When is it? - Friday. - You still want to? - I think I need to. - Well, you could use the truck, but do you think you could handle the maneuvering and backing and all that? Why don't you ask Kyle to go with you? - He's awkward. There might be a reason for that. - You ready? - Thanks for going with me. - Well I'm a poor substitute for Mick, but I'll do my best. - It's just one race. You can't win 'em all. - No, I know. I just thought he had it. - It's disappointing isn't it? - Mom would know what to do. - What makes you so sure it's a thing? I mean what if he just slipped? - He turned right into it. I remember mom helping other riders figure this one out. - So it's common? - I guess. - I'll figure it out. - What ado you know about barrel racing? - Nothing, but I'm good at research, and we're a team, right? - Okay. - How's Mick doing? - The nurse had him up and walking today, so that's good. - I'm really glad to hear that. - Laurel said he's already plotting his escape. - Sounds like Mick. - I better go. - Okay. - Look who it is, my long lost pal. - How are you feeling? - Like a million bucks. A million old worn out bucks. No, I'm just glad to be home kiddo. - I've been worried about you. - And here I've been worried about you. - Come on, let's get inside. - Laurel, I am so sorry. - We're gonna be just fine. - That's my line. - I have a few huckleberries left, how about pancakes for dinner? - Huckleberry pancakes, that sounds so good. - Lucky knows you want speed so when you go into that second barrel he puts his shoulder into it, cutting through it like a short cut. You ask him for speed, he's just trying to give it to you. So what you have to do is teach him how to put his hip in and not pull his shoulder out. - Right, easy. - Well it can be, it's just a lot of ground work. - Listen to you. - I told you, I do my research. - Seriously, where'd you learn that? - YouTube. - What are you doing? - Sorry, I didn't wanna wake you. - Couldn't sleep? - Ah, not really. - What's going on? - I, uh, start to doze off, and then it feels like it's happening again. - I don't want you to go back to work, not yet. - Then what? What am I supposed to do here? - Trust. - Hey Jessie. - Hey. - You look great in those jeans. - Thank you. - So are you coming? - Where? - The bull bash. There's gonna be some hellish rides. You should definitely be there. - Maybe. - Well, if you nothing else you should come to the after party, it's our tradition. - Oh, what kind of party? - Nothing too crazy, just good times. I'm especially inviting you. - I'll definitely think about it. - Have you seen Gamble looking a little lame? - I don't know, maybe a little. - Oh, look at you, taking the initiative. - I've been working my way through the tack room. It's kind of fun. - It can be. So how are things? I hear Mick's on the mend. - He's starting to seem more like himself. - Big jokester, isn't he? - Yeah, mostly. - Well I'm glad he's doing better. - Do you ever ride just for fun? - Less and less it seems. - When you did, you could pick any horse you wanted? - I have a few options, yeah. - How would you choose? - What do you mean? - Well if you had two horses, and one was really fast and exciting, and the other was really steady and predictable. - And boring. - Yeah, boring. You'd choose the fast one? - Predictable isn't boring, it's just predictable. If I'm on a trial ride in the mountains, I wanna know how that horse is gonna act. If a grouse flies up, and I'm on the side of the mountain and the fast one's inclined to bolt, that's not exciting, that's dangerous. - Right. - So it's more a matter of trust. Do I trust him or does he trust me? You'll figure it out. - Why? - Because I don't wanna go alone. - I guess, but what about Kyle? - I don't know, it just seems like it could get weird. - Because of Blaze? - Yeah, he asked me there especially, isn't it weird to bring a guy? - I guess. But you don't really know him, Jessie. He was never nice to me before. - Maybe he never noticed you before. - Well yeah, that's kind of the point. - I just, I don't wanna be rude. - And you don't wanna go alone. - Right. Don't you wanna see some bull riding? - Well not especially, but since you're my friend I guess I can go. - Thank you. - Hello my good man, welcome to the yellow submarine emporium. What's your delight? - You know what I want. - You never know, one one these days Blaze might just blaze one. - Full dose. Have fun. - Hey, uh... - What is it? - It's nothing. I was just thinking, I'm gonna be back at school the rest of the week, but what are you doing Friday? - Oh, I was gonna go to the bull bash on Friday. - Oh, do you want me to go with you? - No, that's okay. It's just for a friend. - Friend who rides bulls? - Uh-huh. - So is this like a... - Look, I better start warming up. - Okay. I'll see you after. - This looks great, Aunt Laurel. - I thought a salad would be nice. - How are you? Who me? - Do you know when you're going back to work yet? - So far that exact piece is unclear. - They just don't know what they're doing, it'll happen. - So how's your new coach working out? - Who Kyle? He's fine. He's just not you. - Well I heard he solved Lucky's problem. - Uh-huh, research. - So when's your next race? - Well, I've been hoping you guys would be able to go. It's at the fair. - I wouldn't miss it for the world. - Anybody want more water? - Hey you, you ready to go? - Wait, you mean go, go? - Yeah. - There's that party after, didn't you want to go? - Jessie, you know they're going to be drinking, right? - Well maybe, but it doesn't mean we have to? - Are you serious? - It can still be fun. - I don't know, I have a bad feeling. - Why? We can always leave if it gets crazy. - I'll just get a ride home. - Really? - Yeah, it's fine. I hope you have fun. - Okay, well thanks for going with me. - Hey Jessie, come hop in with me. What's the matter? You nervous? - Hey you. - Hi, how's it going? - Are you looking for Jessie? - No, was she here? - She just left. - Oh. - Thanks for showing up and watching me ride. - Of course. - It got pretty crazy, huh? - Yeah. - So, have you ever been out here? No. Then welcome to the spot. This is where all the good stuff happens. Cool. Where's the booze, man? - Here. What's the matter? You never had a drink before? - Maybe once with my mom. - Sip with family never hurt nobody. We're all family here. I guess you don't know until you try it, right? - You are so drunk. - Hey, let's go for a walk. Let's go. Get your hand off her. - What's with you? - I said get your hand off her. You ready to go? - You can't just walk in here and order her around. She's with me. - Jessie run. - Sheriff's department, break it up, break it up. Break it up. I guess that's it. Thanks for the tip. - Are we cleared to go? - Cleared to go. Since neither of you was drinking you won't be charged. Thank you. - I feel awful. - Don't worry, you didn't know. - I feel like I should have. How did you know? - Kenzie saw me. She told me where you went. - But how did she know where we were going? - Heard of this place back in high school, wasn't that hard to find. You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I just want you to know I, I'm really sorry. - Okay. Be sure to pick better friends from now on. - Obviously. - There's nobody here. - All the better for practicing. - Are you Jessie Hardin? - Yeah. - I'm Andy Bush, the rodeo coach from Montana State University. I just want to introduce myself today, and I hope you'll consider MSU in the future. - Yeah, I will. - Good luck today. - Thank you. - Have you heard anything back yet? - Not yet. - What you thinking? - Nothing, just sitting. - You better stop sitting and start doing or we'll be late. - You're going? - Of course. - This can't be easy for you. I do so love you. - Hey Jim. Yeah, no, it's fine. What's the word? Really? Yeah, yes, yes, I'll take it. That much? Jim, that's very generous. Thank you.
