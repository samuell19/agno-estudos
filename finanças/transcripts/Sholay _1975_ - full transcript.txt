Errr... Thakur Sir? - Welcome, warden. This way. Thakur Sir. The moment I received your letter, I knew you wished to see me. I took the first available train. I need a favour from you, warden. Sure, sir. Just name it. I'm looking for two men. Two men? Ramlal. Do you recognize them? I can't think of a prison that these two haven't been in. This is Veeru... and this is Jaidev. Crooks, both of them. Thieves of the first order. I know. They're just the kind of men I need for the assignment at hand. I don't know what assignment you have in mind. But I can tell you they're good for nothing. That's not true, warden. For all their vices... they have some virtues, too. A bad penny is a bad penny, no matter what. That is perhaps the difference between a man and a coin. I clearly remember... two years ago... I had arrested them in Jamalpur district. We had to reach Tamli Police Station by dusk. Since no other arrangements could be made... we took a goods train. I... two constables... and these two crooks... Jaidev and Veeru, handcuffed. Sir, were you ever stationed at Daulatpur Police Station? Yes, I was. Why do you ask? I remember now. I've been wondering where I've seen you, ever since you arrested us. Remember Lalji's grocery store... that was robbed? Do you remember? Lalji's store? - No... No? Jai... Jai. Remember, when we were held at Daulatpur Police Station for two days? Daulatpur? - Yeah, don't you remember? When was that? - When we broke into the grocery store. He was the officer then. Don't you recognize him? All cops look the same to me. What can I say? He's always talking nonsense! How long have you two been up to these antics? You could say, we've been at it since we were kids. Why do you do all this? For the same reason you're a cop. Money! No. I'm not a police officer just for the money. I have enough ancestral land to take care of my needs. Perhaps... playing with danger gives me a high. We face dangers, too... every day. There's a difference. I face dangers to protect the law. And you do it to break the law. And in both cases... you need to be brave. Yeah! You need to be brave. I see. You guys think you're very brave, don't you? You will see if the need arises, Inspector. We can take on 15 or 20 guys... at least. I haven't exaggerated, have I? Now that you've said it, we'll deal with it, partner. Bandits! Well, Inspector? Wanna test our bravery? You're running out of time, Inspector. Think about it! But... don't you dare try to escape. Stop the train, driver! Actually, full-speed ahead! As fast as you can! Get going, come on! Charge ahead! Give me a swig! Quickly! Are you okay, Inspector? - I'm all right. Nobody messes with Veeru! They fled, bloody bastards! - Yes. Jai, let's go. Come on! I warned you... don't try to escape! What do you think? We can escape. And leave him in this state? If we leave him in this condition... he'll die. Suppose we take him to the hospital? We go to jail for four to six months. So, what do you suggest? You tell me? Get it out. Heads, we go to the hospital... Tails, we take off. Heads! They are criminals, no doubt. But they're brave. They're dangerous... because they know how to fight. They're bad... but there's a good side to them as well. Could you find them for me, warden? If they're in prison right now, I'll find them easily. But if they're free, guys like them have no fixed address. Hey! Stop! Stop! That's my motorcycle! "We're friends... friends for life." "We live together... we die together." "We're friends... friends for life." "We live together... we die together." "I win, you win; you lose, I lose." "We're in this together." "Your pain is my pain, my life is yours." "We're in this together." "I'd risk my life for you, I'd fight the world..." "I'd risk my life for you, I'd fight the world... for you." "We're friends... friends for life." "We live together... we die together." "The world sees us as two people, But we're really one." "I hope we never fight, I pray we never go our separate ways." "We eat and drink together." "We laugh and cry together." "We eat and drink together, We laugh and cry together." "We'll be friends forever." "We're friends... friends for life." "We live together... we die together." "We're friends... friends for life." "We live together... we die together." What, Soorma Bhopali? Why're you removing more wood? Obviously! You expect me to add more? The scale is tipping over and you want more? Take your wood, give me my money and get lost! Here's two bucks. I can see that, but is the note real? Yeah, it is. Well then, good-bye. What about my change? - Change? What do you mean? - That was a two-rupee note. So? This wood is worth two rupees! That's it! Just this much? What do you want? An entire forest for two bucks? Look here, I've had enough! You better get the hell out of here. They don't call me Soorma Bhopali for nothing! Understand? Get lost. God knows where these guys come from? Thinks I'm shortchanging him. Wants a jungle for two bucks! They come in every morning and ruin my day! Can't get rid of them! And look here! Do I pay you to recite poetry, Mr. Chand? Go see if the truck has been unloaded! Well, well! Are we here to fool around? You guys think this is wayside inn? And who are you guys? God Almighty! It's you! How are you, Soorma Bhopali? Thanks to you... I'm fine, thank you! But what the hell are you two doing here? Come here! The cops have a reward on your heads. Two thousand rupees. If I'm seen with you, I'll be in big trouble! So please get going! Know what, Soorma Bhopali? We want to go to prison. I hope god fulfills your wish! Had we been in Bhopal, I'd have you locked up in just two minutes! They don't call me Soorma Bhopali for nothing, you know! But here... why do you need me? A warrant's out for you guys, anyway! But we want you... to turn us in. What are you trying to say?! The reward of 2000 rupees... we want you to get it. And when we come out of prison, you give half the money to us. Get it? - What are you saying?! Have some paan. Go on, go on... it's great! This is my lucky day. God is great! Attention! Since when have they started having a parade here? You've just arrived, boy. You'll get to know soon. The new warden is nasty! Nasty new warden, he says. Here he comes. Attention! Attention! I said Attention! But they're already at attention, sir. I know, I know, I know. Prisoners! Pay attention! This is a warning! Everything that went unchecked before my arrival here... will no longer be tolerated! No, no, no, no-no-no! I've been a warden since the British times! Not like today's namby-pamby wardens... who waste time trying to reform prisoners! I know for a fact... That you guys can't be reformed! How can I reform you, when I can't reform myself? I know, my words don't go down well these days. Which is why I get transferred so often. But despite all my transfers... I have not transformed. So, remember one thing. Don't think I won't know what you guys get up to. I have spies everywhere; in every corner of this prison. Everything gets reported to me, as it happens. Without my permission... not even a bird can flap its wings. What the hell was that?! - A bird, sir. Pigeon, pigeon! - What's that in my eyes? Get it out! Never mind! This will do for today. You may leave now. Let's go! Strange guy! Who's the warden's spy? Shall I tell you? It's that barber, Hari Ram. He's pretty thick with the warden. The swine! - Hari Ram, the barber! Hari Ram, shave my moustache off as well. - Take it off? It's all been arranged! We get cracking tomorrow. Really? How many days will it take to dig the tunnel? Ouch! You cut me! The tunnel? It should be ready in about a week. From where are you going to dig the tunnel? Next to Barrack No. 9. I hope the warden doesn't find out. No one will hear a word of it! Let's go! There. I'm done. Sir... Yes, Hariram? What news do you bring? You need to be careful, sir. There are plans to dig a tunnel in the jail. Ohh! A tunnel in my jail... What was that? A tunnel in my jail?! Yes, sir. The prisoners are digging a tunnel. I've been a warden since the British times! A tunnel in my jail?! Halt! Attention! So this is where the tunnel is being dug! Wonderful! But you guys seem to have forgotten... that my spies are in every corner of this prison. What's this? So this is the tool with which the tunnel will be dug. I've been a warden since the British times- Here he comes! Is it all arranged then? - Yes. We won't fail this time! A pistol has been sneaked into the prison! There's a pistol in the prison? Yes. In just a couple of days... the warden and his spies...bang! bang! A pistol in my prison? - Yes. A pistol in my prison, you say?! - Yes. You mean... a revolt?! - That's right. Blood bath?! Guards! Guards! - Guards! Halt! Search every nook and corner of this prison! Half of you go in this direction. Half of you go in that direction. The rest of you... come with me! Halt! The pistol is here. Move an inch and...bang! bang! Guards! They're gone. Let's go to your office. - How can I? You've asked me not to move. The first order stands cancelled. Let's go. A warden from the British times... so afraid? No-no-no! Come see us off at the gate first! Attention! Left turn. March forward. Right, left. Right, left. Right, left. Left, right. Left, right. Left, right. Halt! Tell him to open the gate. Yes, sir. Open the gate. - Yes, sir. Here's the key. And here's the pistol! The two of them must have tried to run away, right? Tried to run away? That's an understatement! They did everything they could! But I wasn't about to let them go! As I threw one to the floor... the tall one tried to escape. I dragged him back and asked, "Where to, mister?" With two stinging slaps, I ordered them to the police station! That was it! They were begging at my feet! Did Veeru and Jai really beg at your feet? - Yes. I've heard they're dangerous! They are dangerous, all right! But they don't call me Soorma Bhopali for nothing, you know! Try and imagine it. They wept at my feet! And begged for forgiveness. I'd have forgiven them, too! But I was so furious! How dare they trespass into my territory! What happened next? - What else?! You know I carry a stick! It was days since I had used it. I twirled it around and thrashed them good. I gave them a terrible beating! - And then what happened? What do you think? I grabbed them by their collars and said... What did you say? - What did I- What did I say?! Yes, I remember... I said. "Do let me know if there is anything else I can do for you?" Listen, guys... have you nothing better to do? You sit here all day long and make me tell lies? Get back to work! Go on... you lazy bums! Well... I was only kidding. How did you get out of jail so soon? My word! The stint in prison seems to have done you good! Brother Soorma. - Yes, brother. We are here to collect our thousand rupees. Thousand rupees? That's right. One thousand bucks. Uhh... I remember. The thousand rupees! I got the money the very next day after your arrest. Since that day, the money has been lying in an envelope in my pocket. Check it out, there are ten one hundred rupee notes. Count them. Well, brother Soorma...see you. - Yes. I've looking for these two. When does their prison term end? On the 18th of next month. Excuse me, could I have a cigarette, please? Well, well, Inspector? Who have you brought to prison today? I'm not an inspector anymore... just Thakur Baldev Singh. Why? Don't like playing with danger anymore? If you are so arrogant about your bravery... will you take on a mission for me? We only work for money. How much do you want? What's the job? If you're so brave, why do you care? Name your price... as long as you do what I want you to. Gabbar Singh?! The notorious bandit?! Yes. He's the one. I hear the cops have a reward on his head. 50,000 rupees... dead or alive. You must capture Gabbar for me... alive! You want us to capture Gabbar Singh... alive, that too! Thakur, Gabbar Singh is no lamb... That we can just chase and catch! I know it's a difficult task. But no one pays so much for something easy. Let's suppose we risk our lives and capture him somehow... you want us to hand him over to you for just 20,000 Rupees? While you take home a cool 50,000 for nothing? You can keep the reward from the cops as well. I only want Gabbar! Some old feud? That's none of your business. May I ask you another question, Thakur Sir? You know we're criminals, too. So why choose us to track Gabbar down? Because... you need fire to fight fire! Ramlal. That's 5,000 Rupees. You will get 5,000 more on your arrival in Ramgarh. The rest after you complete your mission. Partner... what do you think? Heads, we go. Tails, we don't. Well, gentlemen? Where do you wish to go? Belapur, Naupur, Fatehgarh, Ramgarh... where to? Haven't you seen a horse-carriage before? This is a village, sir. You won't find cars here in which you can speed away. Basanti's horse-carriage is all that you'll find around here. Look...I'm not a chatter-box at all. So, tell me... you wanna go or not? - Well, we do wanna go- It's okay if you don't wish to go. I won't be mad at you. You stepped out of the station, so I asked, as I felt you might need a ride. But if you don't need a ride, you don't need a ride. Take it or leave it. I mean, it's just a ride. There's no obligation. I'm not forcing it down your throat or anything. It's the same difference, you know. It's like- Yes, yes! We wish to go! Let's go, buddy! - Sure. When have I refused? Look... I'm not a chatter-box at all. But I'd better tell you in advance. A ride to Belapur costs two rupees and Ramgar his one and a half. Don't haggle, please! What Basanti says is final! Okay, that's fine... - I know what you're gonna ask. Basanti, why two bucks for Belapur and one-fifty for Ramgarh? For that, ask me what village the horse-carriage is from? Go on, ask me. What village, tell me, please? - It's from Ramgarh! I see! So... it is from Ramgarh. Now, I know. You see, there's one thing worth considering. When I make a trip to Belapur, I actually make two trips. To Belapur and back to Ramgarh. But if I go to Ramgarh, I go to Ramgarh. I go straight home. Because this carriage and I... both belong to Ramgarh. But that's my story. Now where would you like to go? You see, we'd like to go to Ramgarh, too. Sure, sure! When have I refused? But you will have to tell me whose house you're going to. "Basanti, take me to so and so's house." Because if I don't know where you wish to go... where will I stop the carriage? And how will the carriage stop if I don't stop it? You see, there's one thing worth considering. Who's driving the carriage? I'm driving it. And if I don't know- We need to go to Thakur Baldev Singh's place. Sure! Let's go! When have I refused? You should've said you wanted to go to Thakur Sir's house. Come on, Dhanno! It's same difference, you know... Anyway, let it be. So you see, I'd already lost my parents. So, first my uncle then my aunt, and after that... who's drives the carriage? I do, of course. People often ask me... "Basanti, being a girl, how can you drive a carriage?" But I have an answer ready for them. When Dhanno can pull the carriage despite being a mare... why can't Basanti drive the carriage being a girl? Tell me? - So what's wrong with that? City girls drive cars but nobody questions them. You may be from the city, but you seem to be pretty smart. What's your name? Veeru. You didn't ask me my name. What's your name, Basanti? Shut up! You're always talking nonsense! You see, I wasn't talking to you... but since you've asked, let me tell you... my name is Basanti. Never heard the name before. Basanti! What a lovely name! There's a story behind why I was named Basanti. Really? Tell me, tell me. When I was a little girl... my aunt's brother-in-law's mother-in-law said... What did he say? That every body gets a name. That's a given. But there's one thing worth considering... And so... she should be named Basanti! That's it, Dhanno! Halt! This is the Thakur Sir's house. Strange! You guys were talking so much... I didn't even realize the distance. Yeah, we're kinda talkative that way. Here's your one-fifty. You see, you're a nice man. So, I shouldn't be taking money from you. But if a horse starts feeling sorry for its hay, what will he eat? So, I will accept the money. That's very kind of you. Let's go, Dhanno! About turn! Wow! I love the sound of her voice. The sound of her voice? She talks too much, man! Come on! You see a girl, you start flirting! Come... Welcome, welcome. This way, please. Hello, Thakur Sir. You had no problems getting here, I hope? Not much. Come in. Had you informed me, I'd have sent someone to receive you. Your stay has been arranged. Just let me know if there's anything you need. Ramlal. I'd promised to pay you 5000 rupees on your arrival. You remember your mission, don't you? I want Gabbar... alive! - Of course, we remember. You want Gabbar... and you want him alive. You'll have him. You must be tired. Get some rest. We'll discuss the rest later. Follow me. This way. Please go ahead. I'll go fetch the keys. Jai... that safe was stuffed with cash and jewellery! Folks in this village seem to wear a lot of gold. So, what do you think? Quite a big house... and beautiful, too. Who else lives here? Your keys. This is where you'll be staying. Let me know if you need anything. We will. Veeru... I can't quite figure this out. Who cares, Jai? Thakur has already paid us 10,000. Let's clean out the rest of his safe tonight and disappear. Okay. If we're going to do that tonight, let's get some rest. Yeah. Thakur! These guys- They're my men. Then why did they attack us? I wanted to see... if you still possess the same courage and strength. Or whether time has slowed you down. So? What do you figure? I see... that I made no mistake in bringing you two here. You made one mistake, Thakur! You showed us your safe. Here's the key to the safe. It contains jewellery... that is of no use to me. As a widow, I will never need it again. It has some money, as well. You can take that, too. At least... it will put an end to my father-in-law's false hopes. Hopes, that he's pinned on you two. Excuse me. What happened last night, won't happen again. Here... have some more. You eat enough for a horse, you know. But when we have to make a trip to Belapur...you throw tantrums! Go ahead and eat. Basanti! I'm here, feeding Her Highness, aunty! Now, she's gonna start! Listen to me, girl! You roam around all day. But you can't do a simple chore for me! There she goes. Ranting as usual! Aunty, why do you always have to lose your temper with me? Can't you take it easy? What did you ask me to do? You asked me to go to the doctor, right? I did go to him to get your medicine. But what could I do if he wasn't there? The neighbours said he's very ill... and has gone to the neighbouring village for treatment. Oh ho! I didn't even mention the doctor and you've given me a whole lecture! Then what did you ask me to do? Didn't I ask you to fetch some raw mangoes for the pickle? But, as usual, you forgot. Raw mangoes! Oh yeah, you did tell me! I'll get them right away. Imam Sir! May I walk you home? - Who's that? Basanti! - Yes. It's you. I've spent so many years in this village... from well before you were born. Not a single day has passed, before I come down the mosque steps... someone's here to help me home. Of course, people will help you. There's not a soul in the village who doesn't respect you. And when they respect you so much, why won't they help you out? Of course, they will. But there's one thing worth consid- You talk so much. Why don't you talk some sense into Ahmed? He's even younger than you. He'll listen to you. I know perfectly well how to make people see sense, Imam Sir. And I can reason with your son as well. But the thing is... how can I talk sense into him without knowing... what I'm supposed to be talking to him about? Ahmed's uncle works at a cigarette factory in Jabalpur. He earns 300 rupees every month! Really? - Yes. He's written to me so many times, to send Ahmed over. He'll talk to his boss and get Ahmed a job. But Ahmed just won't go! He says he doesn't want to leave me alone here. How are you, Basanti? - I'm okay, Ahmed. Tell me one thing. You're a graduate... and you speak English, too. Your uncle in Jabalpur- -There you go! My dad's got you going as well. That's all he can talk about these days. So, what's wrong? Basanti asked... and I told her about it. You know, I'm not a chatter-box at all. But just think about! It's a cigarette factory! Work as long as you like then take a break and have a smoke. It's like eating the mango... and selling the seed. Damn! What's wrong? - Mangoes! I forgot again! Raw mangoes! - Raw mangoes? Yes, I have to get them for the pickle. Darn! Hey, what are you doing here? Well...not much. Tell me, which mango do you want? Can you really shoot down any mango I want? I can do it left-handed! The best marks men touch my feet... and tell me they haven't seen a marksman like me. You seem to be quite the sharp shooter! - Sure... he's James Bond's grandson. James who? Never mind. He talks nonsense! So, which mango do you want? That one there... that one... and that one. Wow! Your friend is a great shot, too! Oh, yes. He's pretty decent, you know. I'm still teaching him... he'll learn though. Can you teach me, too? Yes, of course! I can teach you as well. In fact, I can teach you in... t-two days. In just two days?! - Of course. There have been people he has taught in 'just two hours'! In just two hours? - He talks nonsense, you know! Well, come with me, if you wish to learn. Can you see that mango there? You can see it, can't you? - Sure. Now hold the gun. Hold it. And bring this other hand closer... close to the other. Now place this finger on the trigger. - Yes. Now shut your eye and- I've already shut my eyes! What is he talking about? The usual nonsense! Now shut your eyes. - Very well. They're shut, right? - Yeah. Now... can you see that mango? Stupid! How can I see the mango with my eyes shut? What? You shut both your eyes? - Yes. Not both... just the left one. This one. Now use your other eye to aim at the mango. Okay. Now? - Now? Now... Now... squeeze the trigger! Bull's-eye! You see, I thought I was learning how to shoot. But now I smell a rat! A rat? Where is it? I don't understand! But I understand perfectly well! You city-slickers think we villagers are stupid! But Basanti is smart enough to teach you a lesson! I was only teaching you how to handle a gun. You mis-mis-misunderstood me! - I understand you very well! Too well, in fact. Here's your gun! Keep it! I'm going home! Good-bye! Thakur! Thakur! Kashiram! Dholiya! Where the hell are all of you? Come, Shankar. What have you brought? I brought millet, sir. Bloody swine! A handful of millet? That's all you have for us? Are you saving the rest to feed the guests at your daughter's wedding? Believe me, sir. I've brought everything I have. We need only one bullet to blow... your brains out! Bastard! And what have you brought, Dholiya? Wheat, sir. Very well. Keep all the stuff there. Hold it! Welcome, Thakur! You're still alive, are you? Yes. And as long as I live... Gabbar will not get a single grain from this village. Who's going to stop us? You? Yes. Me... and my men! These men? Guys, Thakur has put together an army of eunuchs! Death hovers over your head, Kalia! Just look around! Two. Is that all? Enough for you. Kashiram... Have all the stuff taken back. Think about it, Thakur. When Gabbar finds out... the people of this village refused to give him provisions... there will be bloodshed. Why unnecessarily- Go away! And tell Gabbar... the people of Ramgarh have stopped feeding rabid dogs! Get lost! All right, Thakur! We're going. Come on! How many men? Two, chief. Hmmm... two men. Goddamned swines! Just two of them... and three of you. And yet, you came back? Empty-handed? What did you think? That I'd be delighted? That I'd pat you on your backs? Shame on you! Samba! What prize has the government placed on my head? A full fifty thousand rupees, chief. Hear that? A full fifty grand! And that's because... even in villages a 100 miles from here... when a baby cries at night... his mother tells him- "Go to sleep, child... go to sleep... or Gabbar Singh will come and get you!" And these three cowards! They've ruined Gabbar's reputation! You will be punished. You certainly will! How many bullets in this revolver? How many bullets? - Six, chief. Six. Six bullets. This revolver has six bullets. Six bullets... and just three men. That's not fair at all! It's fair now. Now it's okay. It certainly is. Three chambers are loaded... and three are empty. I'll just spin this around, here. Now, I don't know which three chambers have bullets, and which three don't. I really don't know! This revolver... holds three lives... and three deaths! Let's see who gets what. Lucky bastard! You, too! What's gonna happen to you, Kalia? Chief, I've always been loyal to you. Now... die for me! Amazing! All three survived! All three- All three bastards survived! All three escaped death! Those who live in fear... must die! When is Holi? When is it? "Come on, friends! Come on, friends!" "Come on, people!" "Come on, people!" "Catch her, catch her! Don't let her get away!" "Don't twist my arm!" "Hold on, sweetheart!" "Get lost, you drunk!" "What's up, Romeo? - You wanna come with me?" "The festival of colours! Time to get high!" "Don't give me attitude!" "You want me to swear?" "Why don't you, baby?" "It's Holi, the festival of colours!" "On the day of Holi, hearts are in full bloom." "Colours blend with colours, people come together." "On the day of Holi, hearts are in full bloom." "Colours blend with colours, people come together." "All grudges are forgotten..." "even enemies embrace each other." "On the day of Holi, hearts are in full bloom." "Colours blend with colours, people come together." "On the day of Holi, hearts are in full bloom." "Colours blend with colours, people come together." "It's Holi." "Let me make a colour like the colour of your skin." "Let me steal some pink from your rosy cheeks." "Get lost, you flirt! Don't use Holi as an excuse..." "Get lost, you flirt! Don't use Holi as an excuse..." "to tease me, touch me, play with me." "Ask anyone... Excuses like this, help hearts meet." "On the day of Holi, hearts are in full bloom." "Colours blend with colours, people come together." "If that's what you want... Then this is what we'll do." "Don't come close or touch me..." "You can play with me from afar." "You're like a sparkling diamond. But as delicate as a porcelain doll..." "You're like a sparkling diamond. But as delicate as a porcelain doll..." "that will break at the lightest touch." "Delicate flowers like me can get hurt by the touch of thorns like you." "On the day of Holi, hearts are in full bloom." "Colours blend with colours, people come together." "All grudges are forgotten." "Even enemies embrace each other." "On the day of Holi, hearts are in full bloom." "Colours blend with colours, people come together." "On the day of Holi, hearts are in full bloom." "Colours blend with colours, people come together." "On the day of Holi, hearts are in full bloom." "Colours blend with colours, people come together." "On the day of Holi, hearts are in full bloom." "Colours blend with colours, people come together." "On the day of Holi, hearts are in full bloom." "Colours blend with colours, people come together." I see. So, this is Thakur's soldier. Samba, Kaliya said there were two. Where is the other one? Where are you? Hey, soldier... where is your partner? Tell me! Listen up, soldier number two! Show yourself, or I'll shoot your partner! Hold it! Welcome! Welcome! Now, you're at my mercy! Welcome. Welcome. Good boy! Well, Thakur? You brought these two to protect Ramgarh, did you? To fight Gabbar? Listen, everyone! Come out of your homes. These two were brought here to protect you from Gabbar Singh. What happened to your heroes? Hunh? What happened? There's only one man who can save you from Gabbar's wrath! Only one man. Gabbar himself! All I demand in exchange for your security are a few provisions. Am I committing a crime? It's no crime at all! No crime, I say! Enough! After this, if anyone raises his voice again, I will chop his head- Aaah, heads... You guys think these two are pretty tough, don't you? These hired gun men will now... place their heads at my feet and beg for mercy! They will be at my feet! Did you hear what I said? Did you hear? Your heads, my feet! Come on. Move it! Jai?! Come on, Dhanno! Samba! We can no longer fight your war for you, Thakur! The respect we had for you is gone. We came here for the brave inspector... who waged a lone battle against bandits on the train. We didn't come here for a coward... who isn't willing to pick up a rifle lying in front of him to save our lives! You wish to go. Okay. Go. But before you leave... don't you want to know why I didn't pick this rifle up? What reason can there be? You're a coward! You're afraid! No. It's a long story... It goes back to the days... I was posted at Belapur Police Station. We got a tip... that Gabbar was going to raid Haripur village. The police intercepted at the right time and the bandits had to flee. I chased Gabbar. Let me go! Let go! Leave me alone, you bastard! Gabbar Singh! This isn't an arm, it's a noose! In view of the testimonies and the evidence at hand... this court has come to the conclusion... that Gabbar Singh is a dangerous and habitual criminal. This court holds Gabbar Singh alias Hari Singh guilty of armed robbery... and under Section 400 of the Indian Penal Code... sentences him to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment. I won't forget this, Thakur. I won't forget you! After 20 years in prison... you'll forget everything, Gabbar. No prison in the world has walls strong enough... to hold Gabbar for 20 long years! And the day I escape... you will pay for it, Thakur. You will regret it! Take him away. This is going to cost you, Thakur! Thakur Sir! Congratulations! Yet another criminal you've nabbed is coming to my prison. He's a very dangerous man, warden. Be careful. I'm glad your leave application was accepted. It was bound to be. You've asked for leave after a very long time. Mr. Khurana, had I not taken leave now... my family would've stopped talking to me. It's the same story with everyone in our profession. I face the same problem. How big is your family? Pretty big. I have two sons who are married... and a daughter ready for marriage. I hope to find a nice groom for her this time around. I also have a grandson. Grandson? You don't look that old! People get married at an early age in villages. I got married early, had a son early. Since my son married early, he had a son early as well. In fact, my grandson's about 8 years old. You mean, old enough to be upset if you don't spend time with him? You bet! I've bought gifts for everyone to keep them happy. I've never accepted a bribe in my life, Mr. Khurana... but I have to bribe my family whenever I go home! Well, I'll take your leave now. - Okay, goodbye. Best of luck. - Thanks. Sir... - What is it, Ram Singh? Gabbar Singh escaped, sir! Gabbar Singh escaped?! - Yes, sir. You missed, again! You're a bad shot, Uncle! Yeah, right! As if your dad hunts lions every day! Just shut up! Uncle, you're going to the station to pick grandpa up, aren't you? May I come along? - Go ask your mother. Why don't you ask her? Just tell her you're going with me. Go on. Mom... Mom... - Don't bother me. May I go to the station with uncle, mom? No, not to the station. Madam... I've told the carpenter to fix the gate. And here is the flour, the seeds... and the dye you wanted. Radha... Coming! Keys. I'm going to the temple. Is there anything that needs to be done? You go on, I'll manage. Let's go. - Give me that. May I go to the station, mom? I already said you can't. Let him go if he wants to. No way. There are always so many trains passing by. I'm afraid. All the trains have an axe to grind with your son. They'll leave the tracks and chase him, right? Don't over react. So... you're preparing dad's favorite dish, hmm? Let him go. - Go ahead and spoil him. You plan to go like this? Go take a bath. Tell your aunt to... Nirmala! Yes? Can you get Deepak dressed? I'll do it right away. Go. Again? Can't you lay off the vegetables? Everyone's busy today. Everyone wants to impress dad. Who do you think does the chores every day? What? This wheel's still here? Ramlal is becoming a forgetful old man. I'd asked him to have the sitting room and dad's bedroom cleaned, but there's no sign of him. He's gone to the temple with Radha. He'll do it when he returns. Hey, Ninni! Yes, brother? - Have a bath and get ready! Aren't you going to the station? I'll join you in a minute! Rukmini, I can't figure how this idiot found a wife as great as Radha. It was I who asked dad to pursue the alliance. But does anyone ever acknowledge what I do around here? I've found him a wife who's one in a million! Otherwise, girls now a days want a separate home the day they get married. Wait and watch, what a great match I'll find for Nimmo. Ninni! No! Gabbar! Y-yes. Welcome, Thakur. I knew... that you would come. Look at him struggle! - You bastard! You bloody bastard! Curse me as much as you want... to your heart's content. You bastard! - Shout! Shout some more! Remember? I screamed that day while you watched? Today, you will scream while I watch! Know what, Samba? I was livid at the court that day! So furious! Given the chance I'd have strangled him then and there! The bastard! But I couldn't help it! I was held by four cops! My hands were cuffed, my feet, shackled! Remember? Remember? Any last wish, Thakur? There's still a lot of life left in your arms, hunh? Tie him up! I'm not going to kill you. After I'm through with you... the world will spit on you. These arms are really strong, aren't they? These arms... are strong enough to rein in a galloping horse! These arms are really strong, aren't they? Do you remember what you told me that day? This isn't an arm, it's a noose! And here you are! The noose has come loose. The noose has come undone. These arms are really strong, aren't they? Give these arms to me, Thakur! No! Give me your arms, Thakur! - NO!!! Did you see anything else? - No, sir. We shut our doors and windows when we heard gunfire. I see. Okay. Put your thumb-impression here. - Very well, sir. Hello, Thakur Sir. I've got the details of the attack from these people. I'd like to discuss some thing with you. The police want Gabbar... dead or alive. You will have him one day, Inspector. Can you tell me anything else about Gabbar Singh? No. Okay. That's all I wanted to know. Thank you, Thakur Sir. Good-bye. Thakur Sir... we don't want your money. Please, take it back. But don't think we won't carry out your mission. Didn't you say you only work for money? Yes... but we'll get our money, anyway. Once we kill Gabbar- - You will not kill Gabbar! Your job is to catch Gabbar and hand him over to me! Alive! Give me your word! You will hand him over to me alive! We give you our word, Thakur. But please take back your money. Thakur. Girija has brought news from Pipli Village. You might meet Gabbar again... very soon. Come. Hello, Thakur. - Hello. What news do you bring, Girija? Gypsies have set up camp five miles from Pipli. Hira and his friends are there as well. Hira is the one who sells arms and ammunition to Gabbar. Gabbar is bound to meet him in a couple of days. Strike... while the iron is hot! "My love, my love." "My love, my love." "My love, my love." "Flowers bloom in gardens. When we meet in the desert." "Flowers bloom in gardens. When we meet in the desert." "When we meet." "My love, my love." "My love, my love." "Flowers bloom in gardens. When we meet in the desert." "Flowers bloom in gardens. When we meet in the desert." "When we meet." "Like a flower that blossoms in spring." "Like the moon in full bloom." "Like a flower that blossoms in spring." "Like the moon in full bloom. So is my love for you." "My love, my love." "My love, my love." "Flowers bloom in gardens. When we meet in the desert." "Flowers bloom in gardens. When we meet in the desert." "When we meet." "On the path of beauty and love." "In your arms, in your eyes..." "On the path of beauty and love. In your arms, in your eyes..." "I have lost myself to you." "My love, my love." "My love, my love." "Flowers bloom in gardens. When we meet in the desert." "Flowers bloom in gardens. When we meet in the desert." "When we meet." "My love, my love." "My love, my love." "My love, my love." "My love, my love." Ramlal. My God! What happened to him? Don't panic. A bullet just grazed his arm. Nothing serious. We blew up more than half their explosives, Thakur Sir, but... Gabbar managed to escape. It's okay. We'll get him another time. Take a swig, partner. All your troubles will vanish. Many of your troubles will vanish if you stop drinking. You? - God almighty! Good afternoon, Imam Sir. I have a letter for you. Here. Must be from Jabalpur. Could you read it for me, Gulzarilal? Certainly. Where are my glasses? They were right here, in my pocket. Here they are. What you're looking for is right here. I have your glasses. Here you are! - The chatterbox is here. Actually... we were going in opposite directions. You were on your bicycle and I was on foot. And after you passed me, I found these glasses there. So, I came to the conclusion that they must belong to you. What's worth considering is that they're really yours! You see- Give it a rest, so I can hear what the letter says. I'll listen to your babble later. - Okay! When did I refuse? Go on, Gulzarilal. It begins with a greeting. - Greetings. Everything is fine here and we pray for your well-being. I have good news. Ahmed's job has been confirmed. His salary will be 200 rupees. He can stay with us. We'll take care of his needs. It's good that he will be in his uncle's care. Oh yes! That's wonderful! That's just what we wanted. I suggest that Ahmed doesn't waste any time. My boss won't wait forever. Please arrange to send him here at the earliest. Everything else is fine here. Everyone sends their regards. Sincerely, yours... Mukait Ullah. - Right. Wait till Ahmed gets here. I won't take no for an answer today. Absolutely! But what do you mean by- 'till he gets here'. He's already here! Dad, I've made my mind up. I'm not going there. You see... this is the same difference as- I've had it with this boy! I have one foot in the grave... while you have your whole life ahead of you! How long will you cling to me? You don't find good jobs like this every day. Your father is right, son. In fact, I've heard people in big cities... like Muradabad and Meerut pray at temples for jobs like- Temple?! What's wrong? You see, I was headed for the temple... and found his glasses. And that was it! I got sidetracked and ended up here! But what's worth considering is that now I've remembered. Hey, Veeru... there goes your chatter-box. Hey, Basanti. You're on foot today? Did Dhanno run away with the carriage? I don't think you get the simple fact... that people here don't just elope. Dhanno is at home, like a good girl, but today being a Monday... aunty told me that if I pray to Lord Shiva every Monday... I'll marry a man who everyone will envy. I said, fine... I don't intend to marry a bum anyway. Okay, then... I'll get going. A very good day to you. Good day to you, too! Good day to you, too! Lord! Nothing in this world is hidden from you. You are omnipresent, Lord! Look, I'm not saying you've forgotten. But it's always good to remind you, right? Today is Monday and I have a small request, Lord. Look at my hands... they've become all hard and rough from pulling on Dhanno's reins! Nothing is difficult for you, right? Get me married into a family where I will rule like a queen! You see, life should be easy and fun! I leave the rest to you. Young lady! Who is that? It is I! Lord! You! This is a miracle! I have found a match for you, my dear. On the first Monday itself? That's excellent! I'm sure you must've chosen the perfect partner. Could you tell me his name, perhaps? Or should I come again next week? I will do as you say, Lord. His name is Veeru. Veeru?! This concerns the rest of my life! Please don't be in a hurry, Lord! Even if it means I must come here a few more Mondays. He's okay looking, but he's a bloody smart ass! Silence, girl! I never talk without reason, Lord! So, I'll do as you say! If you don't obey my command... you will remain unmarried all your life! Forgive me, Lord! - Listen! You see... You see, you will continue to drive the horse-carriage all your life! I now command you to go... and tell your aunt, in no uncertain terms.. that you choose Veeru as your life partner! Therefore, your prime duty hereafter is to respect and honour Veeru. Because you will attain heaven only at his feet. Should you please him... I shall be pleased! But if you upset him... I shall be enraged! Really? So, go- Basanti. Basanti. Basanti, I was just- You think I have no brains because I'm a dumb village girl. You thought you could fool me? You think you're very smart? But Basanti can outsmart guys like you. Now, you stay here and pray to the lord. I'm going home! Basanti. Basanti, listen to me! "A beautiful girl looks even prettier when she's angry." "A beautiful girl looks even prettier when she's angry." "Like a train leaving a station..." "She takes off, playing hard to get." "Get lost!" "Whip in her hand, cursing away," "Whip in her hand, cursing away," "These horse-carriage drivers have a lot of attitude." "When a horse-carriage driver gets angry..." "She looks lovelier than ever!" "A beautiful girl looks even prettier when she's angry." "Flowing dark locks, stunningly pretty face." "Flowing dark locks, stunningly pretty face." "Sweetheart, you're simply out of this world!" "When a kite breaks free..." "It paints a rainbow in the sky." "A beautiful girl looks even prettier when she's angry." "Like a train leaving a station..." "She takes off, playing hard to get." "Playing hard to get." "Playing hard to get." Jai... I've been thinking. You should do that once in a while. I've made a major decision. I know what your decision is. You want to marry Basanti. That's wonderful! Spoken like a true friend! Only a true friend would know what I'm thinking. And I also know... this is the 8th time you've decided to get married this year. But this time it's final, buddy! Final? You've been drinking since the morning, right? Will you do me a favour, partner? - What is it? Go speak to Basanti's aunt and create such a great impression... that she allows me to marry Basanti. Why should I? - What? It's always the groom's side that makes the proposal. Besides, you're the only one I have in this world, Jai! Look, you want to get married, go do the talking yourself. Think about it. After marriage... a nice little home. It'll be your home. - A loving wife... Your wife. - 7-8 kids... Your kids. But you're the one they'll call uncle! They'll sit in your lap, climb onto your shoulders... and say with a lisp- "Uncle, uncle, tell us a story." That means you'll employ me as a maid in your household after you're married. I get it! You're not a true friend! To hell with such a- Acting pricey, aren't you? Just because there is no one else who can do this for me, right? Had my mom been alive... I'd be settled by now! I would have children! Had my old man been around... he would've had a grand wedding for me. If I had brothers and sisters... they would've begged the old lady and seen to it that I married Basanti. But don't forget, Jai... for those who have no one, there is a god up there! Lord! You're no longer the friend you once were! You don't want me to give up my life of crime and settle down! You've changed, my friend, you've changed! Ass! Bloody drama queen! Cut it out! I'll go talk to the old lady, okay. - Really?! Son, an unmarried, young girl at home... is a burden that weighs one down. I'll be at peace only once Basanti is married. Yes, you're right, aunty. I can understand your burden. But I can't just dump her into a well, can I? Please don't mind... but I must ask... about your friend's family, his character and his income. As far as income goes, aunty... once he's married... I'm sure he'll start earning. Does that mean he doesn't earn anything at all right now? When did I say that? Of course, he does! But it's like this. Nobody can win all the time, right? From time to time, the poor guy's bound to lose. Lose money? - That's right, aunty... but then... that's gambling for you. What else can I say about it? My God! So, he's a gambler? Not at all, aunty! It would be a shame to call him a gambler! He's a gem of a person, decent and noble. But when he has too much to drink... he's bound to lose sense of right and wrong! And then, friends force him to play cards. How's poor Veeru to blame? You're right, son. A drinker and a gambler... and yet, he's not to be blamed! You're misunderstanding my friend. He's innocent... he has a pure heart. Just get him married to Basanti and... I'm sure he'll give up drinking and gambling in no time at all! Don't try and pull wool over this old lady, son. I've seen it all. Has anyone ever been able to give up drinking and gambling? You don't know Veeru. Believe me, he's not like that at all. Once he's married, he'll stop visiting nautch girls! The moment that happens... I'm sure he'll stop drinking as well. Good Lord! Is there anything else? He likes to go to brothels, too! So what's wrong with that, aunty? Kings and princes used to patronize nautch girls! I see! Might as well tell me which distinguished family your friend hails from? Well, we'll let you know the moment we find out! I must say one thing, son. Despite all your friend's vices... you can only praise him! I can't help it, aunty. I'm a very considerate person. So, should I assume that it's a 'yes' from your side? Yes?! I don't care if she remains unmarried all her life! But I certainly will not let Basanti marry such a wayward bum! I'm her aunt, not her step-mother! It's sad... that you've refused, despite my best efforts. Poor Veeru. I wonder how he'll deal with this? I'll jump off, I'll leap off, I'll kill myself! Get out of my way! Hey, wait! What are you doing? What Romeo did for Juliet! What every legendary lover has done! Suicide! Suicide! Hey, what's 'suicide'? When the English die, they call it 'suicide'. But why do the English die? What is the matter? Why do you want to commit suicide? Don't ask, uncle! You'll burst into tears! It's a very sad story! This story has emotion, drama, tragedy! You know Basanti, don't you? I was going to marry her. But her wicked hag of an aunt won't allow it. I can't live in this big, bad world, anymore! I bid you farewell, villagers! Good-bye! Good-bye! Hey, what is 'good-bye'? When the English go away, they say 'good-bye'. But where do the English go? Hey, everyone! Here I go! God! Here I come! Hold it! Wait! - What?! Wait? Okay, if you insist... I'll wait for a while. Hey, what sort of friend are you? You're going to just sit here? - Why? What's wrong? How am I to know? Look at what your friend is doing. Look! You see? You see that?! - Villagers! Yes, I see. But nothing's going to happen. He'll climb down once he sobers up. I've seen cruel people... but I've never seen a heartless friend like you. Hey, hold on! I have no one in this world! No friend, no well-wisher! So, I am going to end my life! But I must warn you, villagers! When a lover takes his own life... horrible calamities follow! What kind of calamities? - There will be famine... drought... and disease! And all because of that old hag! Because of this old hag! - My God! You will see for yourselves, villagers! When I die... police coming... police coming... old hag going to jail! In jail... old hag doing hard labour! Say yes, aunty! Or he'll kill himself! But how can I say yes, Dinanath? Don't beg this hag for me, people! Nothing can stop me now! I will certainly end my life! One, two, three... Please say yes, aunty! You'd better say yes, or you'll be... caught up in police stations and courts forever! But I've never even been to court... or a police station! Then you'd better give in, aunty. - All right. Stop, Veeru! I agree! Aunty has said yes! Now, come down! Come down! Come down! Who wants to marry the old hag, you morons? It's Dhanno- I mean, it's Basanti I wish to marry. Basanti. I'm willing to marry you, Veeru! Come down now! Hear that, everyone? The old lady is willing... and so is Basanti! So, dying cancelled! I'm coming down, aunty... my dear aunty! I'm coming down... Hey! Hey, what are you doing?! What do I do now, uncle?! God... aunty has agreed! Good bye, dad. - You're leaving, are you? Go on... may god be with you. Write to me, the moment you get there. - Yes, dad. You tend to skip meals. Look after your health, okay? As my dear father used to say- In good health lies true happiness and wealth. Let me walk with you a little. I'll get some air. - It's okay, dad. Relax... I'll go on my own. Okay, then... give me a hug. Hurry up, Junga... I have the queen of clubs. Forget that, Samba. Look there... a lamb to the slaughter! Chief... Yes? This boy is from Ramgarh. He was on his way to the station when we spotted him. Ahmed? Basanti! Basanti! Why is it so quiet here? Imam Sir. Who is it? Veeru? Why is there so much silence here, son? Please come with me. Please, come. What's wrong? What's up, son? Where are you taking me? Who's that? Ahmed? Ahmed! Ahmed! Imam Sir... I'm very- What's the point of consoling him now, Thakur? You're responsible for all this! It's true! And the rest of you... listen to this letter from Gabbar. Addressed to the people of Ramgarh, it says - Look at the consequences of challenging me! Of letting Thakur fill your ears! If you don't mend your ways... death will rear its ugly head in every home in Ramgarh! If you care for the lives of your families and children... then at sunrise tomorrow... hand over Thakur's men to me, at the old hill. Chief of the Bandits -Gabbar Singh. You've landed us all in grave danger, Thakur! What have you done? Dinanath, if we wish to lead an honourable life, we must pay a price. We can pay the bandits with food grains, not with our children's lives! We are farmers, not soldiers! You're right, Shankar. We are indeed farmers. This has been a country of farmers for ages. But each time we've been attacked... by God, we farmers have melted our sickles to craft swords! We don't have the blood of cowards coursing through our veins! We don't have the blood of cowards coursing through our veins! But how is violence and bloodshed going to help? After all, non-violence is a virtue, too. I believe in non-violence as well. But is it an act of non-violence... to grovel before a cruel, evil man? It's nothing but cowardice! It's a sign of weakness! Those who don't bow are easily broken, Thakur! Thakur can neither bow nor break! Thakur can only die, Kashiram! But as long as I live... I will live with my head held high! How long are you going to live, Thakur? And how long will we live... if these two stay in this village? If you think you can save your children's lives... by handing us over to Gabbar Singh... go ahead and do it. We are ready for it. Yes, now we must do what is right for us. We can't bear this burden anymore. Who can't bear this burden anymore? Do you know what the greatest burden in the world is? A son's dead body on his father's shoulders! There can be no heavier burden. If an old man like me can bear that burden, why can't you... why can't you bear this burden? There's something I strongly believe in. An honorable death is far better than a life of humiliation. I've lost a son today. But I still want these two to stay here. The rest is up to you. It's time for my prayers. I will ask god today... why he didn't give me more sons to sacrifice for this village? Will someone please take me to the mosque? Come... Let's go. What's this? A letter? Of course, you idiot! It's a letter. Read it. Gabbar Singh, for every one villager that you kill... we will kill four of your men! Kill four? Check if it's the same two guys... or have they dumped someone else here? Gabbar Singh, for every one villager that you kill... we will kill four of your men. This should be fun! It's been ages since I've run into worthy adversaries! The game's just getting started. And it'll end... with the death of those two! Not only that, every family in Ramgarh will perish as well! Here you go. Looks like he was bothering you. Son, she's an unfortunate girl. It's almost like she's forgotten how to speak. Unlike before. I often think back to the day... I first visited her village with Thakur. It was Holi. Hey! That's enough! It's Holi! The festival of colors! Don't resist. It's the festival of colors! If you drench me here, how will I play Holi with your father? What's the point of playing with dad? He just doesn't know how to celebrate Holi! He's been sitting at home all day. If people older than dad come over, he touches their feet. And if people younger than him show up, they touch his feet. They apply a pinch of color on each other's foreheads... embrace each other and that's it! They're done! But that's not how it's done! We really know how to celebrate Holi. Really? And how do you celebrate? Us? You know Paro, don't you? Paro? Yes, Paro! There's a huge water tank in Paro's courtyard. We've put a whole bunch of colours into the water. While people normally throw colour on each other... we dump people into the colour! The moment we catch hold of someone- Bam! He goes straight into the tank! I hope you don't have a water tank at your house! Or Ramlal and I will find ourselves neck deep in it. Watch what I do! Anyone home? Who is it? Scared you again! Crazy girl! Thakur! Why didn't you tell me? Welcome, welcome, welcome! Happy Holi to you! - To you, as well. What are you waiting for? Get some sweets for Thakur Uncle. Just a moment... Dad, shall I bring your plate? - Plate? The one from which you take the pinch of color... Sure, go ahead and bring it. This way, Thakur. It's kind of crazy inside. Let's go sit there... So, Ramlal? All well? I'm fine, thank you, sir. Well, Thakur? I hope you had a good crop this year. Actually, I've become a stranger in my own house. Ramlal is the one who handles my farms. When it comes to crops, his word is final! Sweets for everyone! Sweets for everyone! Open your mouth, uncle! That's enough, dear... Okay, Mr. Ramlal... open your mouth! Quickly! Give it to me, dear. I'll have it. - No way. I'll feed you! Open your mouth. Just give it to me. - No! She's like your daughter, Ramlal. Let her feed you. He's right. Now open your mouth! My God! How could I forget the plate? She's a very jovial girl. You bet! Always creating a racket! It's Holi! Don't resist! It's Holi! Here's your plate of colors, dad! Help yourself! I'm leaving! - Where are you going? To celebrate Holi with my friends. May I? Haven't you had enough of Holi yet? It's the festival of colours, uncle... Red, yellow, blue, green! How can anyone ever have enough colour? Think about it. Wouldn't the world be dull place without colour? And look at her now. Her world truly has no colour left in it. When tears wash away a young bride's henna... what colour can she have in her life? Veeru. I've made a decision. Really? So, you've started making decisions, too? Yes. Now that you're taking the plunge, I might as well. What? Get married. Get married?! You want to get married?! Yes, I've had enough. I feel it's time to settle down! Have a little house of my own, a wife... children... who'll climb onto your shoulders... and make you tell them stories- - Hey! That's enough! Sit down here, will you? Sit down, please. I hope you do realize that to get married... one needs to find a girl. Have you found someone? Yes, I have. - Who is she, may I ask? Radha. Radha? This Radha?! Have you lost your mind? Don't you know who she is? Look, Veeru... even thugs and criminals deserve a second chance in life. And Radha has done nothing wrong. She has the right to start a new life, doesn't she? How's it possible, Thakur? What will people think? It's unacceptable in our society. Society was formed... to save people from loneliness. It was never meant to isolate anyone. Besides, must we let Radha suffer in silence for fear of what people may say? How long are we going to live, anyway? We might be gone soon. Who will she rely on? Who will she turn to? I thought about these things... and came here. But you are her father. I'll leave the decision to you. Not at all, Thakur. She's your daughter now. Whatever you decide will be best for her. I still want you to meet Jai once. I'll send him over in a day or two. Jai. What's on your mind? Nothing. I get it! I know what you're worried about. You're wondering whether she'll yes or no. I suggest you flip the coin again. If it's heads, it's all gonna be okay. If it's tails... well, well, well! Veeru... if everything works out... why don't we settle down here, in this village? Brother, you read my mind! I've been thinking the same thing. We can't be thieves all our lives. We've spent enough time in prison. Once we get some money, we'll settle here. Buy some land, do some farming. But we don't know to use a plough. How will we become farmers? Being bad taught us how to use guns... Being good will teach us how to use a plough. You're right. A man learns a lot in life when he needs to. I've already worked things out. I'll marry Basanti, the horse-carriage driver... and have two or three children in a few years. I've even thought of names for the brats! And when I ask my wife... where the kids are... she'll reply sweetly- They must be at Uncle Jai's place, listening to stories. Why must you always send your children to me for stories? You know I can't remember stories, Jai! Stories, hunh? You don't even remember what happened yesterday. Yesterday? Of course, I remember. Yesterday, I met Basanti. And we agreed to meet again at the lake this morning! This morning, hunh? - Yes! I gotta go! Come on, Dhanno! Let's go, Dhanno! I'm counting on you today! Come on! Go, Dhanno! Faster! Faster! Hey, Samba... What do the people of Ramgarh feed their daughters? Look at her. She sure is eye-candy, isn't she? Eye-candy, all right! Chief, I snuck into Jamnadas's wedding in Haripur last year. She put on quite a show with her dancing. Wow! She must be a sizzling dancer! Show us a couple of moves, darling. Now look here, baby. Don't give me any attitude. Or I'll scrape this beautiful skin off you. Get it? Veeru! Wait a minute, darling. Tie the bastard up! You seem to have the hots for him, hunh? Well, hero? Now, you're at my mercy! Are you having an affair with her? You bastard! I've never seen a creep like you! And you probably never will! Because your life is going to end right now. You bastard... No! You have the hots for her, don't you? Pretty sweet on him, aren't you? Hey Samba, pick up your gun! And aim it at this dog! Now look here, baby. If you wish to save your lover... dance for us. No! Don't you dare dance before these dogs, Basanti! Samba! Resist any longer... and your lover's head will be blown off! One more thing, baby-doll. As long as you dance, he lives. The moment your feet stop moving... that gun will go off! "As long as I live, my love..." "I will dance for you." "As long as I live, my love..." "I will dance for you." "As long as I live, my love..." "I will dance for you." "As long as I live, my love..." "I will dance for you." "Love never dies." "It doesn't even fear death." "Love never dies." "It doesn't even fear death." "We will suffer, we will burn, we will die..." "But our love will live forever!" "As long as I live, my love..." "I will dance for you." "Let my anklets break." "Let my feet bleed." "Let my anklets break." "Let my feet bleed." "My heart is yours, your heart is mine." "All for love... we'll walk the path of fire!" "As long as I live, my love." "I will dance for you. I will dance." "I will dance." "I will dance." "I will hold my head high." "My voice can't be silenced..." "I will hold my head high." "My voice can't be silenced..." "I'll speak, I'll suffer, I'll bear the pain..." "I may be helpless, but I have no fear!" "As long as I live, my love." "I will dance for you." "As long as I live, my love." "I will dance for you. I will dance." "I will dance." "I will dance." If anyone moves, he'll be dead meat! Gabbar Singh! Tell your men to drop their guns! Go on! Follow them! Go! And don't come back empty-handed, you swines! Hurry up! Jai! Are you all right? - Yes, I'm okay. Veeru, the three of us can't get away on one horse fast enough. I'll stay here. You take Basanti to the village and hurry back. Bring lots of ammunition with you. No! I'll stay here! You take Basanti back! Listen to me for once, Veeru! Take Basanti! I'll stay here. No, Jai! I can't leave you alone. One of us has to go, Veeru. We'll run out of bullets soon. You know what... let's flip for it. If it's heads, I'll stay back. If it's tails, you hold fort. I win! But I can't let you- - No ifs and buts, Veeru! Leave your rifle and ammo behind. Take Basanti and leave! Go! Jai, for some reason, I don't feel like leaving you here alone. Take care, okay? Okay. Gulab Singh! Just one bullet left! Jai! Jai! Jai! Jai! Jai! Jai, are you okay? - Yes... Yes, Veeru... I'm okay. See, I killed those bastards! Jai! Jai, don't be afraid, Jai! Don't be afraid! Why should I be afraid when you're with me, Veeru? We'll go away, Jai. Back to our village! Everything will be all right! My time is up, Veeru. - No! It's all over. - No! No, Jai! Don't say that! Don't say that! I... I have no regrets, Veeru. I spent my life with my best friend... And now I'm dying in his arms! But there's something I won't be able to do. I won't be able to tell your children stories. Nothing will happen to you, Jai! You're going to be all right! But you... you will tell your children the story our friendship, right? You won't forget our story, will you? Don't say that! Look, Veeru. Look! That's another unfinished story, Veeru. I'd made so many plans and... Jai! No, Jai, no! You can't leave me like this! You can't leave me like this, Jai! Veeru... Veeru... - No! Veeru. - No, Jai! Please don't! No, Jai! Jai, you can't do this to me! "What have you done?" "You've betrayed me." "You've broken your promise." "Why have you left me all alone and gone away?" "We were supposed to do this together." "We're friends... friends for life." "We live together..." "We die together." Jai! You cheated to save my life? I swear on your blood... I will kill them, each and every one of them! Each and every one of them! Gabbar Singh! I'm coming for you! Gabbar! Come out! Face me like a man if you have the guts, you bastard! I'm here to avenge my friend! I swear I'll kill you today! Veeru! Hand Gabbar over to me. No, Thakur! No! I won't let this bastard live! Don't forget your promise, Veeru! I don't remember any promise! All I know is... this bastard's men killed my friend! And I'm going to kill him for it! It was your friend who made the promise! Leave him alone. Thakur! Had I made the promise... I would've broken it today! But it was Jai who gave you his word. So... You can't fight me, Thakur! I've already cut off your arms and thrown them away! One uses his feet, not his hands to crush a snake, Gabbar! My feet are enough to finish you off! These arms are very strong, aren't they? Gabbar! Give me your arms! No! Give me your hand! No! Thakur Sir! Let him go! The law will decide his fate. The law wants Gabbar, Inspector... Alive... or dead! Are you going to let your emotions get the better of you? Don't you respect the law anymore? Thakur... I know what you've been through. But don't forget... you were once a police officer... who's highly respected even today. Well, Thakur Sir... I'll be on my way now. I know I can't share your grief... but I can understand it.
