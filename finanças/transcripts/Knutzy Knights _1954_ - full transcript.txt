Oh, weep not. Unhand my lass, you brazen ass. Begone, you scrabble-head. She is promised to me. I am bursting with tears. Thou art a wet weeper. Pardon me. Ah-ha, your tears will avail you nothing, my proud beauty. You'll still be mine. Stop it. Stop it. I can't understand it. This routine killed them in Cucamonga. Yeah. Hey, come on. We're sorry, Your Highness, we... Unfortunately, your play has voiced the exact predicament of the princess. My father, the king, has pledged my hand to the Black Prince. But I love Cedric, the village smithy. Oh, if you could but help me. We will indeed, fair princess, but where can we find Cedric, this village blacksmith? Under the spreading chestnut tree, around the corner by the pawnshop at Pittsfield and Tonsilvania. Oh, fear not. You will be in his arms ere morning. Ooh! Ooh! Why, you iron-head. Oh, oh, oh, oh!

You dope, two heads are better than one. Two heads... Get out. You idiots. They're gonna give him a haircut down to here. I'd hate to be in his shoes. I'd hate to be in his collar. I'd hate to be him. I still don't understand why he wants to kill Cedric. I'll tell you why. Because, I, Cedric, dare to love the fair Princess Elaine. That's Cedric. Hey, Cedric, you got nothing to worry about. We got a plan for tonight. Ah, you are indeed my benefactors. I don't know how to thank you. Oh... How can I thank you? - Oh, not again. - It's all right. Now, here's the plan. You and the three of us go into the palace grounds... Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ah, ah, ah. Oh, Moe, I'll never be able to write underwater. Oh! Take it easy, kid.

Oh, oh... ♪ Uh-oh. The Black Prince. Call out the guards. To arms! I heard you shout. What is it? Your Majesty, Cedric, the blacksmith, was below. So he dares to come here to the very palace. Take the princess to my room. Father. Go. She'll be more easily guarded there. But Your Majesty, where will you sleep? Here, of course. Yes, sir. This is a fine how-do-you-do. How do you do? Quiet. The signal. The coast is clear. We can't get in the palace. They must have guards all over the place. Well, then, let's go home. Quiet. I got an idea. One of us can climb that trellis. Yeah, one of us. Yeah, that's a swell idea. One of... Wait a minute, fellas, not me. Come on. No, I get dizzy. I get dizzy, kid. Go on, get up there. Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. How do I know the babe won't scream her head off when she sees me? I wouldn't blame her. We'll write her a note. Good idea. Throw some gravel up to wake her. Here's a rock. I'll tie the note to this rock Oh. Oh. And throw it up there. Somebody threw some back at me. What'll I do? Get out of here. Out of the way. Oh! Go on, now get up there. Go ahead. Do as you're told... Hey, hey. Now, why don't you watch...? Ow! Look, raise your foot up to the next... Oh, I'll murder... Psst. Hey, kiddo, are you awake? Yes. Me and my pals are on your side, so don't you worry your pretty little head about Cedric. The king ain't gonna push us around, no, sir. Say, how come a nice kid like you has such an old sourpuss for a pappy? Uh-oh. The guard awaits your orders, sire. Good. Send them in. I'll get you, you no-good... Help, help, help! Hey, I'm slipping! Oh...! Get him up. Someone will pay for this. It's the king! Scram! Guards! Guards! Hey, guards! Take him away! You understand, Sir Satchel, once Elaine and I are wed, the king must die. Yes, Your Highness. You have instructed your assassins? I have. Good. Pay them handsomely. In a few hours, if they strike well, I shall be king and you will be the richest man in all England. Why you... You started that. A oy. Hit him with the left. Hit him right in the right. Whoo-hoo, what an uppercut. Oh, boy, another left, another right. Oh. Come on in here. Looks like dirty work. Poor Larry, he got two of them before they got him. Maybe they give him the big haircut already. You know: If we could only bring him back, I'd never hit him again. No kidding? Get out of here. Hey... Shh. Shut up and listen. You know that Black Prince character? The guy that tried to kill our pal Cedric? Yes. He's gonna kill the king. No. Yes, but we'll spoil his little racket. How? I don't know. But we... I got a plan. Quick, get into these steel step-ins. Psst, psst, psst. They've got Cedric in the dungeon and we... Somebody's coming. Come on. Hurry up. Everything in readiness? I have done as you ordered, Your Highness. When the guards hear the fanfare of the trumpets, Cedric's head will fall. Good. Good. And when the trumpets sound the second time, you shall strike the king down. We must act quickly to stop them. Come on. Knights and ladies, I have glad news for you: Elaine is to be wed. Let the trumpets sound. Load those trumpets so they can't blow. Play. Sound those trumpets! Blow them, I say! Ooh! Ooh! Hey, load them up again. Don't eat them. They've foiled us, but we shall strike the king down nonetheless. Then I shall... Sound those trumpets. Sire. Come on. Why you... Assassins take them away. Cedric. Cedric, darling. Oh, Elaine. He saved your life, Father. Grant us permission to wed, sire. What? My daughter marry a smith? Take it easy, king, millions of women marry Smiths. Right. We'll have a wedding after all. Sound the trumpets. Fruit salad. What do you know?
