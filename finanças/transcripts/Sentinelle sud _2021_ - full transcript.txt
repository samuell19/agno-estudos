"Go to the hold and count the dead sheep." "Sometimes they smother each other in their fear." Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Citadel A Tokarev was found on you. Why a gun, Mr. Lafayette? It's not mine. You're a soldier? Are you always armed? What about alcohol? The fight in the club and on the parking lot, any explanation? It took 3 officers to control you. This is not your first run-in with the Law. As a minor you were prosecuted for theft and violence. Problems with child welfare. Multiple foster homes. And the Agricultural Mechanics workshop? I was an apprentice before the army. I'm going back. You're going back? Afghanistan. What have you done since your return? You have a home? I have a room. You no longer live with... Mr. Morizet? Mr. Morizet passed away. Who is Mrs. El Khoury? She was my foster mother. When was your last job? As a civilian. I... I have no training. I never worked as a civilian. Your license is suspended. Violent behavior, drinking... the Tokarev. Have you considered help? From a psychologist? I have an address for a job. They've taken our boys before. Major, they kept the Tokarev. The one you gave me. Thank you, sir. Christian. It's the last time I bail out my sentinel. I can't always back you here. Don't worry, I won't make trouble. You say I live like a hippie? Wanna get some furniture? Hey, it's fucking filthy here. Get your ass over here, dirty Arab. What's this grime? You need nails to scratch it off. This a fucking refugee camp or what? You got the M-16? It's dead. Breech is broken. The American... - Was he really an Indian? - Cheyenne. I patrolled with him once. He ate corn, talked to the dead... Spiritualism stuff. Scared the crap out of me. Look at this shit neighborhood. Worse than when we left. Remember flying in on a chopper? I looked down and thought... this is the middle of nowhere. I'm gonna die here. - What's this investigation? - Bullshit. Shit rolls downhill. HQ investigating the ambush? They wanna know why the guys died. Give a story to the families. Shit like that. What'd you say? I got shot before we reached the village. You'll testify too. Shitting your pants, Christian? The regular army don't understand. But the major does when he sends you into a trap? Father couldn't have known. Father's a racist pig. Fuck him. I shut my mouth to keep my pay. Don't want my mom cleaning houses. If the judge drops in, I'm dead. No terrorists here! No, sir! Hey, what's wrong? Christian, Agamemnon wants to say hi. Agamemnon! Come on, dog! Show me your stuff! He's writing Mommy! C'mon, kids. Come on, leave Christian alone now. I'll be right back. Here are two sweatsuits for him. Why doesn't he come pick his things up? Why does he send you? I know where he lives. The President Hotel is closed, there's no cleaning. Why doesn't he stay here? He had Vanessa. Mounir was a good boy. Now he refuses to see the doctor. I told him to see the fakir for his leg. Maybe it'll heal. He won't listen to anything I say. Mounir will be back. You're more like a son than him. When I saw his leg, I cried. That's why he's mad at me. I'll bring him home. Don't be sad. What happened to you? Are you working? At a supermarket. The major's taking me back. You want to go back? Yes, Nicky? Don't worry, I know where it is. It's under your pillow. Go see. Children like you. Mr. Morizet is dead. He wrote you a letter. Poor man lost sleep over you. He wrote me? I gave him the address in Kabul. He was sick. It's a shame you had a falling out. She keeps going on about my leg, my future, work. Says I need projects. What about Vanessa? I'm a cripple with a tube in his dick. I liked the gunfire. You're such a peasant. Go back to your farm. Morizet wrote me a letter. It's in Kabul. Major, gotta go back, Lafayette forgot a letter! How's life, Mounir? You should do some gardening. Plant something. Didn't your dad grow strawberries? Sure did, Mr. Abraham. Don't know what workers eat these days. May I? Christian, my brother. Your brother? So, Mounir the soldier, what's up? My guy's not back but he's coming soon. Who's your guy? A soldier. He's not back and my money's over there. And you came back lame? How's the leg? El Khoury's bummed. For killing his Muslim brothers? Ahmed! Ahmed, that's enough. Go for a walk, you two. Christian... You a soldier too? Your friend didn't come back? Don't think so. And when will he? El Khoury lied to me. Said military airports had no checks. Hey, I'll find him. Mounir. These aren't the old days. You're not dealing hash in junior high. Find whoever you want, but get me what I paid for, you hear? I won't always be able to help you. You knew damn well. Henri and Cheyenne were druggies. Opium everywhere. The Yanks sent it back in coffins. The entire base was stoned. You just preferred booze. You said I need a project? You're a whitey. - What's that mean? - It means I'm Algerian again. I got no French general's name. The army's over for me. The ambush brought me back to the projects, busting my Algerian ass. You deal with this, keep me out of it. Right, Snow White. You raked it in during searches too. Henri's got the money? - He gave it to the Mullah's son. - How much? How much did Abraham give you? 50,000. 50,000. For 3 kilos. Abraham was super happy. Didn't need to mess with Turks or Albanians. - Where's Henri? - Who knows? He doesn't answer. I was in the hospital! I fucking hurt. Got no drugs, no dough, nothing. And his mom? His mom thinks her son had malaria. - Don't cross the line. - I didn't. I said you crossed the line! Why do you always fuck up? Henri's not even your buddy. I knew Abraham, he knew the Mullah's son. Hello. Hello. I'm Christian, from Carmin. - I was on tour with Henri. - I sold his dog. Is Henri here? Henri's gone. Henri, how's life? - I'm with Mounir. - Hey, Henri. So you made it out? Yeah. This is for you. Same as over there. I get it at work. Came out of your hole? Yeah. Why the wheelchair? Let's go outside to talk. Let's go, Henri. Hello. You have visitors? You came to see the artist? I didn't eat my beans at lunch. Mrs. Thauvin, where's your vase? In your room? - The baby's in 8 weeks. - That's right. With you, I won't forget. I want one too. Lucie's baby has no dad. Why not? Little Jesus. Go get your pottery. I'll give you a minute? Henri? What do you want? You wanna make headlines? Listen, piece of shit. I always knew you were cracked, but I want my opium. You hear me? Tell me where it is. You remember the Mullah's son? Shit, I'm talking to you! - That's not Agamemnon. - Fuck your dumb dog! What is this place? Henri. Do you understand me? You understood what I said? Stop screwing around. Stop screwing around. Where's my opium? - Where? - Let go of him. Get out! Get out. Henri, you need to remember. Don't be a smartass. It's okay, Henri. He's uptight. How long will you stay? I dunno. Why not stay with your mom? She killed my dog. We fight the whole time. When I'm not well, I talk to people in my head. I'd rather be here. Henri. Remember what you should've brought back with Mounir? The opium. Remember your buddy, the Mullah's son? The money Mounir gave you? Right before the ambush. The children... The children... It's okay. Think of something else. I'll get you out of here. - He's a good friend? - Yes. He's making progress. Other than the beans. And his wheelchair. He won't get out of it. It's like his home. Did he mention anything in particular when he got here? - Something he lost over there? - No. His dog. He loved his dog. His major said there was an ambush. The major came? Yes. He spent two hours with Henri. Read the doctor's reports and asked questions. It's best not to mention the war to Henri. It wasn't during the ambush that Henri... It was 2-3 days later. We thought he was acting to be sent home. When we found him, he said he'd been chosen by God. That his sacrifice would end the war. He'd dug a hole and buried himself. Spent the night there. He had a grenade but it didn't go off. Did you find him? Yeah. How did he become a soldier? Who knows. Read too many books. He's just a kid. I think he wanted to leave his mom's. And you? I was messing up. Lucie is wearing roses today instead of camelias. You like them? Is the gentleman the dad? No, Mrs. Thauvin. I've already told you. Thank you. You like taking care of nuts? Have to be careful not to go nuts myself. You were in a fight? I was drunk. How'd you feel afterwards? Fine. No, I mean after the ambush. I didn't open a can of beans. To go back, I need to see a shrink. Coming back, all that stuff. - You want to go? - I can't even drive here. I can drop you off. I mean... Did you unpack my shampoos? Why'd you do that? Stop doing it that way, it's too neat. Otherwise, they'll give me the frozen section. How's it going, Christian? Working? Got five minutes? What are you, captain? Sergeant? Nothing at all. Just a soldier? It got messy over there. Some sort of fuck-up. What about Mounir's debt? El Khoury is crippled. He's finished. His people avoid him. He mistreats his mom, he has no future. Where are you from? Who's your family? Mounir's mom isn't yours? What's family? The army? What do they do for you? You work in a supermarket. What do you want? I can give you some business. You'd run a crew. Show them how to work. My soldiers don't listen to me. Today's kids are dumb asses. Only money matters. Or the Jihad. I told my brother, guys who come back, they've seen things these kids haven't. You're different. Our young people think they're super heroes. Afraid of losing their phone. I'm going back. Christian. You've got something the others don't. You deserve more than dying for your country. You can do what you're good at with us. We're a family. And in our family... our kids don't work in supermarkets. We buy supermarkets. What's your dream? Dunno. That my pals not be dead. Us Abrahams, my father and his father... no one wanted them cause they were Gypsies. No one. My dream was to build them a house. Protect them. With us, you'll be safe. I have to get back. Rushing through the night Attention, take care! Unsteady flight! The world is full of murdering Attention, take care! Unsteady flight! The world is full of murdering Fly through the world engulfed by night, Gray traveling squadron! Battle cry yelling, wan quivering light, Far heaves the quarrels cauldron... Do you drink every day? No. Did you take drugs there? A Pakistani med for diarrhea. Nothing else? Guys took smack. Made it easier to kill. How do you see the future? I want to go back. Too many died. I'm ashamed to stay here. What am I here to talk about? The ambush? Start where you like. I'm supposed to say things like, "I'm a living dead"? Ma'am, I came here, I have a job and a room. Like a civilian. Everything's cool. I told the Father. You saw a priest? No, the Father is our major. Our leader. The priest is padre. What does the Father... or the major say? He said to wait. They're investigating his role in the ambush. What do you think? It's bullshit. Other officers want to undermine him. What did you do before the army? Nothing. Ran away from my grandfather's. Mr. Morizet? He died while I was gone. Were you fond of him? Yeah. We'd argued. The old man was never happy. Never knew what to expect. Why'd you argue? I lost a sheep. He wasn't really my grandad. He just took me in. What if you had to leave the army one day? You mean become a civilian? Civilians make war at work. It's worse than over there. What, I can't go back? I don't know. Over there, we're like a family. I have my pals. Without them, I don't exist. I'm useless. I drink when I'm alone. In memory of our soldiers who died in the Her at ambush in Afghanistan on August 18, 2008. Your son is a fine element for Carmin. - Honestly. - Major... May I talk to you, sir? Excuse me. Major, I can't stay here with civilians. I gotta go back. Why'd you decorate Hubert? He wasn't there. This isn't the moment. C'mon, let's split. Forget them. C'mon, Christian. How'd you get decorated? Lick the Father's ass? My title is "lieutenant." You lick his ass? Are you still a soldier? Not working at the supermarket? Go cry to your shrink. Christian, c'mon. Shut up, Mounir. Lafayette needs to confess. Lafayette! Lafayette! Mounir! - Mounir! - Yeah? You in there? What? Your pals came to the store. They stay away from my job, okay? Don't know how they found me. You gotta settle this. Henri will tell me. Drop it, the nurse says he's lost touch. No, he hasn't! He's playing retarded instead of talking. Face facts, the Mullah ripped you off! What's the plan? Hole up in this shithole? Henri's my pal. They don't touch him. Abraham offered me a deal. A jewelry store. What? To pay him back. What did he say? Go in and grab everything I could. I got a bad premonition. You'd rather rat on Henri? Who asked you? Stop saving my life. This isn't the regiment. This is France, Carmin's done. And? I'm not allowed to shoot a guy or steal his shit. That's the deal. The social contract. - And we're part of it. - I didn't sign anything. Should've thought before going to Abraham. Doesn't even work. Get some oil. Don't touch the rifle. It's Cheyenne's. - It's dead. - We don't need it to work. - Take off your bracelet. - Why? What if you need to run or climb a fence? It could get snagged. I can't. Why not? - I can't take it off. - Why not? Because. Because what for fuck's sake? It's my talisman. Your name tag is your talisman? You got a real talent. I'm not a boy scout leader. I give orders and you obey, soldier. I don't send men on tour who don't give a shit about France. What's that? A goatee? You just woke up? How old are you, Gustave? Fourteen? Eighteen. Big car thief. What's your mother say? That you need... Huh? - Military training. - That's right. That's what auntie from Mayotte says. So be a pal and give me your tag, obey the lieutenant and get us some oil. Move it. - He's just a kid. - He's a good driver. Hardest part being back, no one tells you what to do. Need to know what you want. You idolize the Father. Open your eyes. The mission orders, the explosives factory, we were set up. And he decorates Hubert! France fought its wars with us. France is a battlefield and the corpses are guys like us. France doesn't understand why the Empire's over. Why Algeria and Indochina wanted their independence. Us "Arabs," as you say... They sent us to Verdun, Monte Cassino, projects and prison! We're not people to them. Gimme a cig. My mother can't even read. As if we weren't French. You can't understand, you're a real Frenchman. Isn't that right? Yeah. Since when? I dunno, since France exists. Since France exists? Maybe your mom's a Senegalese albino. In '56 you'd have tortured me in Kabylia. Any news from your dad? Him? I thought he'd be happy I enlisted. His son in the French army, uniform and all. I miss the guys. What did Mouasca say? When you got to him he wasn't dead yet. He said, "Mom." He didn't want to get close to anyone. Didn't want to get close cause of all the shit going down. You don't decide that. We'd be close anywhere. Not just cause of the war, right? Your mom was sad when I left. My mom loves her foster kids. Sometimes I wonder why the first burst was so short. Why the others were shot. Simeones, Mouasca, you... Why'd it stop right before me? It's obvious. Allah chose you, Lafayette. Allah chose you. One minute. Only one missing is Henri. Henri the madman. He led the prayer. "Give me, O Lord, what remains Thine" "What no one ever asks of Thee." "Give me, O Lord, what remains Thine," "Give me what others do not want." No one move or I shoot! On the ground! Don't move, I said! On the floor! The floor, I said! One minute! Anyone move, I shoot! You, on the floor! On the floor. No one move. Don't move. 30 seconds, South. What're you doing? Time to go. Stop crying. - Stop crying! - South... Fuck, South. Look at me! Look at me! Look at me. Pull back. It's all over. Let's go. Mayotte, we're coming out. Where are you? I can't hear you? Where is he? I lost contact. Gentlemen! Police, don't move! South! Step on it! What the fuck! I said to leave! The police searched the military academy. Wanted a guy who looks like a soldier. He was with a North African who limped. Something about a jewelry store. They won't make a link with you. This was El Khoury's doing? You buried me alive here. I told you, I can't take civilian life. Why'd you decorate Hubert? He wasn't even there. No stripes, you only do the dirty work? El Khoury had a problem. Carmin sticks together. You taught us that. What problem? Something to do with Henri. Did Henri tell you what happened that day? Henri talks about his dog. What happened was we had no backup. Henri cracked up. - Had he obeyed orders... - Hubert gave none! Why put Henri in front? I'm the sentinel. You said Carmin needed no one, that HQ were clueless. We were badly informed, under-equipped and Henri got lost. No one died because he cracked up. You sent us there! They're all crazy or crippled. We were unfair to you, Christian. I'll request a Medal of Honor for you. With a citation for acts of valor and devotion. Christian, I know that coming home is hard. Tell me what's going on. Would you prefer jail? You fight like a bum at our funeral. Send the police to search us. Is this the life you want? I can protect my children, but you must be honest with me. If your brothers-in-arms are guilty of anything, I need to know. I'll deal with the police. But these stories about Henri Derevière... Tell me, Lafayette. Henri wanted to bring heroin back. Opium. Three kilos. - Did he take heroin? - No idea. The investigation committee will summon you. Forget Henri. He screwed up in the village. You must protect the family. Come on, Henri. Open your mouth. Please. Eat something. We settled the opium problem with Mounir. Just like over there. Same shit. Smelled like sand and cylinder head oil. You'd have liked it. He won't eat. Henri, you're not eating? It's beans today. You have to eat. Henri? Open your mouth. - Open up. - Is that stuff good for him? He doesn't need it. Good. Good. Some water. Good. Don't stay too long. He's not well today. Can I take Henri out? I don't think so. You need to ask his mom. I'm sorry for earlier. What's wrong with him? Why won't he eat? He's checking out. Careful, the paint's not dry. Thank you. I used to manage. Want to wash your hands? I was thinking... If you wanted... I don't know... Dinner? Sure. Shit. Good evening. Come in. Thanks. - Champagne? - Alcohol free. Are there bubbles? Thank you. I don't really live here. You don't? Want to go somewhere else? It's stuffy in here. - Where are you from? - Peyrestortes. Near Perpignan. I hide my accent otherwise it scares patients. They think I'm an extraterrestrial. "Peyrestortes" means crooked walls. My father has apricot trees. And he makes vinegar. A souvenir from over there? No, a foster home. War started early for me. I should take Henri out sometime. We should let him go. His mom doesn't pay his hospital bills. Are you cold? No. So I shouldn't come closer to warm you? I should get going. It's moving? Must be the champagne. Nothing can happen to little Jesus. You want to feel? Sure. I haven't had a girl in a long time. Thank you, ma'am. The kid's polite. Handsome too. Only flaw, he's not a Gypsy. He's not? How come? How come you're not a Gypsy, Christian? Little princess woke up, come to Grandpa. This is Shanna. My girl's daughter. We just baptized her. Here. Take her. Say hello to Christian. Careful, he's a soldier. He's been to war. There we go. That's good. You like kids? - Shame he's not a Gypsy. - Drop it, Mom. Give her to me. Come see Grandma. Take her inside, she's crying. Mario, my brother. Christian, the soldier. Soldier... - Importers. - Lay off, Mario. Christian... is going to work with us. Right. We never know what El Khoury's planning. He brought the jewels but kept some. Tried to sell them behind our backs. Leave him alone, Mario. I told you, we're done with Mounir. And you? What are your plans? You need to keep an eye on your "brother." Right, bro? Mario, knock it off. Come on, Christian. His glasses give him headaches. You guys need to lay low for a while. Why? You didn't hear? Mounir shouldn't go around with the jewels. My name will get out. Disappear for a few days until we calm everyone down. Okay? You got a place to go? In the countryside. Yeah. Here. It's your baptism too. Lafayette? Where were you? - Physiotherapy. - We're going to the farm. - Not me. I got business. - What business? This? Abraham said we gotta split. You changed Fathers? You're his soldier now? Let him talk. Your farm's got no john, no heating. What'll I eat? The birds I shoot? Why don't you get a job? Sell shoes, drive a truck. Wash floors? Gustave makes more dealing. - I forgot, you're a prince. - Yeah. You think Abraham has plans for me? Want me to work behind a desk like a cripple? Mounir, we came home alive. I have a scar up to my ass and a plastic dick. Henri's lost his mind. The farm sounds good cause you're drunk. Who said we're alive? You freaked in the jewelry store. And with Hubert! Go ahead, drink. The shrinks are spot on with their guilt. The white soldier's guilt trip, my ass. You're sick, pal. Sick from being white. With your Indian rifle, Kabyle foster mom and Christian name... you're lost. Aren't you, farmer boy? Fuck off, Mounir. "Make French friends," my dad said. "Never fall out with a Frenchman." Look at the Frenchman. Alcoholic, fascist, paranoid. What's wrong? What? Say something. With your puppy dog eyes. What's wrong? Mommy abandoned you at a bus station? I didn't want to go to recruitment day. You made me go. Told my dad it was a good gig. I'd have money and could travel. That my life would be easier. He listened to you because he was obsessed. He wanted me to be like you. He wanted you as a son. Look at me now. Look. Look at me. Don't touch me! Is the farm for sale? The farm is yours. He left it to you in his will. He sold the animals, not the farm. You wanted to buy it? - I'd advise you to sell it instead. - No, I'll keep it. - You want to settle there? - Yes. What'll you do? Crops, breeding? Do you know the job? I'll learn. Running a farm isn't easy. Do you have savings or someone to help you? What about equipment and winter insulation? You'll need a loan. - How much does a flock cost? - A flock? It's not just the flock, you'll need at least 30,000. If I were you, I'd sell to the neighbors. I'm going to keep it. We can get a dog. - When? - As soon as I have 30,000. I'll settle in and come get you. Will Lucie come too? I don't know. Are you going to marry her? We'll date for now. If I still know how to. You want to marry her. Yes, you like her. I don't know. Don't know if I'm ready. For what? To marry Lucie. Raise a child. Henri has a question. Go on. What are those chicks? You brought them? Go on. Christian has something to ask you. Yes? Would you marry us? Did you just say that? What are you two plotting? - Did you ask his mom? - She could care less. - You said she pays nothing. - Henri is sick. The farm is isolated. It's not ideal. You said he needed quiet. This farm is your story. Henri needs medical care. He has friends here. Like Mrs. Thauvin? For example, and the others. The three of us could be happy. The three of us? I'd take care of the baby. Christian, that's not why I'm with you. We just met. I have to go. I can take you home. No, thanks. I can manage. Where's Henri? Christian, have you seen Henri? Christian, do you hear me? Christian, cross over. They're behind you in the corn field! The children! Christian, are you with the children? Carmin to headquarters. We're surrounded, send backup! We're stuck! Mr. Lafayette, the Afghan police say village children were killed that day. The report makes no mention. Lieutenant Hubert says Derevière might've killed them in a fit of madness. The second lieutenant wasn't there. Lieutenant Hubert was decorated by your major. Is Derevière guilty of a crime? No, the children... We found nothing. Henri had bad info. I tried to join him by the school when the bomb exploded. That's when we saw the children. An IED must've gone off. There's factories everywhere. They weren't far away. The rebels? The dog barked so we knew someone was moving. We heard them when they... Cut Simeones' throat. One child was still alive but... I couldn't... I'd like Derevière's version. Henri is too sick to testify. Where is he? A civilian hospital. We can transfer him to one of ours. Mr. Lafayette, the area bordering Pakistan is a crossroads of opium trafficking. This traffic supported the Taliban insurrection. Did you discuss this? Yes. You were aware? - Yes. - How? From Afghani soldiers. During harvest, they disappeared. They made more in the fields. You often patrolled. What did you do? - We searched homes and... - Searched homes? Looking for weapons and rebels. One soldier spoke of patrols during this period: "We smashed in doors, threw grenades to wake people up," "shot their tanks and destroyed their crops." Did you take part in such patrols? No. Did you know about them? The rules are different over there. Once you pass the drugstore, it's the Wild West. You plant apple trees for the cameras, then throw grenades at homes. Was the Carmin unit in charge of ungrateful tasks? Did you do the dirty work? We did what we were told to do. Who told you? Your major or Mullah Nazir? We're curious about the ties between your major and this Mullah. Near the border, no one knows the enemy. The Mullah wanted to unite tribes. Others disagreed. The major had to talk with him. Were you present at their talks? No. Henri accompanied the Father to the chouras. Did you meet the Mullah? The Americans call him the "Mummy," but we have no photos. No, sir. Why aren't your major's missions in the operations log? The major stopped reporting back and acted unauthorized. Decisions concerning your unit were overseen by no one. What was in this village? - Do you know? - An explosives factory. - Bombs. - The Afghani police spoke of opium. Did certain soldiers traffic, Mr. Lafayette? Namely Henri Derevière. What was he looking for when he disappeared? Opium? The mission was to destroy explosives. Nothing about opium. I took a few pairs of pants. Did Henri mention anything that happened when he was on tour? The major asked the same thing. He tore my son's room apart. He searched Henri's room? His sidekick. Hubert? My Will KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! Recipe 1 kilo of heroin Rotten Grenades I miss my dog Talk to my mother without fear Rascar the Mummy Tribal Zone, Convoy, Port of Karachi Father in alliance with Rascar Choura, July 19, 120 kilos Rascar wants to take back village Heroin lab? Father okay if Rascar ceases fire Rascar too greedy Three of a kind. What's this? Answer! Is "Rascar the Mummy" the Mullah? The major searched your room. Were you looking for opium? Was the Father trafficking with the Mullah? They'll string you up. What's this? 150 kilos on July 20 and 23? - Don't be mean. - Shut up! Were they trafficking? Look, they disagreed before the ambush. Did the Father get screwed? The mujahid set a trap? - Had to find opium. - What blew up? Was the hatch booby-trapped? The kids wasn't me. They're dead! What were you doing? Christian, stop it! Have you lost your mind? Everything's okay. Calm down. I'll be right back. Christian, I want an explanation. Did the major question Henri? He can't stay here. - He can't defend himself. - From what? Stop trying to save him. Let the Army do their job. - They're coming? - Are you drunk? They'll take him and put the blame on him. Blame for what? You can't understand. He was better until you came. I thought you weren't like other soldiers. Why do you shout at him? "I'm a warrior, I sleep on the ground and eat out of tins." I'm done with crazy men. If you're losing it, then do it on your own. You don't care about Henri... I don't care? Shouldn't fall for guys like me. Who said I fell? Think I'd fall for a guy who pees in bed? Mounir. Mounir! C'mon, Mounir. That's good. I need it for the pain. Did you know we were looking for opium? Did you know? Henri was looking for opium. I thought we were looking for bombs. Your 3 kilos were in Henri's doghouse. That's nothing. The Father worked with the Mullah. We went to the village for opium. The Father has to pay. The whole thing was a lie. Give that to me. Give it to me! Christian. I have it. Three kilos, 30,000. Community garden tomorrow morning. I have to close up. Where's Mounir? Doing business without me? Get lost. - Get lost! - You know shit about dealing. Did you even taste it? You know nothing about drugs, farmer boy. - I know my shit. - Get out, I said. What time you meeting? Get lost. Get lost! Get out. Christian! He'll screw you on the price. I know better than you. What's going on? - You with us? - Shut up. - Are you? - The money! How much? Leave me alone! Hey, that's not enough! I'm talking to you! That's not enough. Fucking hell! You got more, we're interested. Fatso, that's not enough! You hear me? This shit isn't your league! That's not your Albanian trash. Shut up! That's war drugs. Look at me. Look at me when I talk. Drop the bag! Drop it! Get lost. Move it! Stop it! Lower your gun! Who are you? You don't know who I am! I'm Mounir El Khoury! Don't you know who I am? I'm here. Press down. Press down. I can't. I can't. Stay with me. We're gonna split, okay? Look at me. Stay with me. We're gonna split. Stay with me. No one mentioned a transfer. I'm obeying orders. Does his mother know? Henri. We're going outside. C'mon. Come on, get up. Get up! C'mon, get up. We're leaving. C'mon, walk. Where we going? You think I did it for money? What do you know about war? You're an idealist. How do you think we got the tribes' support? To win a battle, you must break laws. Carmin wins wars. Headquarters cries in embassies. And Henri returns to his hole? Derevière is already dead. Was this your Father's? You're the last one, Christian. Our family duty calls for a survivor. To carry the secret. What family? You didn't answer, was this your Father's? You touch Henri, I'll kill you. Come after us, I notify the Law. Henri! You leaving? Any news of Henri? The army will keep him. I'm moving to the farm. I'll buy a flock of sheep and start training as a shepherd. Maybe I could come visit. Once the baby's here. "Christian," "thank you for your card." "It made me very happy." "I hope you're careful over there" "with your comrades." RETURN TO SENDER "Life was good to me." "But soon, I won't be able to take care of the farm." "You didn't find what you were looking for here." "I was probably too old to take care" "of such a young child." "Your aunt and I didn't always love you like you wanted." "We tried to love you like a son." "Life was not always kind to you." "I hope the war ends soon" "and that you find peace too." "The wheat is tall," "soon it will be ripe." "The farmhand will help us with harvest." "Christian," "I've rarely written letters," "but my father always used to say:" "'The heart needs hope." "Take care." "André," "your grandfather who loves you." SOUTH SENTINEL TO CONSTANCE Adaptation: Julie Meyer Subtitling CINELI DIGITAL
