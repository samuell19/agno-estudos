They didn't come to steal, they were looking for something Who could that be, and what were they looking for... How should I know? Go figure yourself I'm leaving Psst! What's up? Tell Argyris you must not leave the house with nobody in, ok? -Make sure that there's always somebody in. -Ok, consider it done! Did you get what I just said? Just checking, since you're a bit slow... Say, why are you always dressed in black? Kind of funny way to begin the morning... It's because Gagarin died, haven't you heard? You're such a jerkoff! What's up in here? She is sleeping "But, I won't spill her blood..." Yeah, right "I won't scar her skin, whiter than snow..." As you say, pal... Tell me, you idiot, since you know everything... Where is better, here or in prison? I know what you'd like to hear, but... leave that for serious people. So tell us your theories and get lost She is sleeping... She is rehearsing for death! One - two... One - two... One - two... Everybody pull back, the attacks have started Anyway, Stathis is dead and his girlfriend dresses in black and whores herself Well, guys, hide well...

What's this mystery? Ok... Who else is with you? Who else? The guy next to you... -A friend... -He can't come in. If he does not come in, I don't come in. -Very good! -All right then... Come in... Sir... Argyris? What do you tell her now? Say, "Yes, Argyris". -Shall we play fair? -How do you want it? Argyris and Andreas. -Are you ready? -Yes, in a moment... Good morning... -How is it going, Argyris? -We came, but I see too much high culture here... Ah, of course! Abstractly artistic, and you get the idea. I've come with a friend, very good, you see... -Who's the person? -...he's cool, he's well built... -What do you mean by "well built"? Is he going to beat us up? He won't beat you up, he'll just do your job just fine... he's my pal... What are you talking about? You've been paid in advance! Ok, but if you can find a person to do the job... -Psst! -Just a sec... So, is it a deal? Anyway, go arrange things, and we can talk later... Just a minute! Shut the door and get ready! -Look, I don't... Shut the door, and no smoking in here, because everything will look blue in the film! Everything will look blue? Tell him to get ready... We're ready... If you don't mind, you can get ready too... Ok, all right... -Dude, I've been framed. -That's quite obvious... -Porn film, right? -You don't say! -C'mon, spill it out... Look, I've taken some money two months ago... for a film which was never filmed, so they called me here for... ...another story, but as you can see I can't do it, it's a porn film... Yeah, you don't say... Well, if I play, I'm threw. I might be unemployed and an outsider, but still... ...but I still have a name... So you're the big name, and I'm the sucker, right? -Don't see it that way! -Which way should I see it? I'll be ridiculed, don't you get it? Laughing stock? I'm not playing in this film. Ok, pal, let's see how we get out of here then... So if I don't play, you're screwed, right? Fuck it... What's up guys, ok? Have we got a deal? Sort of... Yes, of course! Didn't I tell you? Well, he was sure, and he was bragging... Ok, well, then! -Let's go! -What do you mean? -We haven't spoken about money... -What money? What is he talking about? Haven't you explained to him? He explained to me, but give me a bit of money, it won't work otherwise... -Like, how much? -Shall we say... 15? Argyris! What 15 is your buddy talking about? His face won't even show, has he gone nuts? If you don't show my face, what will you show? Look at those angles... Nice teeth... Ok guys... Take 8, and it's already too much... Not to mention I was in jail, and I haven't seen a woman for 6 months... If I get on top of that broad, I'll rip her in half! -Why were you in? -You mean, in jail? In the beginning, I thought it was for political reasons. -After that, I lost track... -Sounds cool... -So, get on with it... -What? But we agreed for 8... Ok, 8 in the hand... -How much? -8 -Plus another 1000 for taxi... -500! Give them 8 and a half, and we're done... Here, give them to my pimp! Make sure you're nearby, to watch over my clothes and stuff... -Ok... -Come on, 'cause I feel like a movie star today... I'll be in the movies! Such a disgrace! Take it easy girl, you've destroyed us both! -Hey, psst! Stand somewhere where I can see you! Of course! I'm here with you! I apologise for the inconvenience... And get on with it... Now stand a bit aside... Get the hell out of here... -What's your name, little girl? -What's her name? -Rosa. Rosa... Well, Rosa and Andreas... -Lie down... -Lights! -Stay where I can see you, ok? -Yeah, I'm right here... -In cold blood? -Do you need a plot? Get her! -Camera and music test! Ready? Go! Man, this is too much! -Come on... -Slow down! Come on Argyris! Tell your friend to start! It's ok, you can stop... Stop... Come on you jerk! What's wrong with you? I don't know... The cello is too much for me! So you don't like the cello? Shall we try with another instrument? Isn't there a chance that we play some Muddy Waters, so that... Muddy Waters... That's impossible... On top of all, she's constantly chewing gum... Everybody's chewing gum in here... Everybody's chewing gum... Listen Andreas, think of the money... We got 8 and a half, fresh from the bank... Hey, pretty! Take the chewing gum out of your mouth! She can't hear too, she's deaf... It's gonna be allright! Rosa! Help him a bit... Take his briefs off, do something, you know... Ok, just tell him to take his elbow from my stomach, he's crushing me! -Ok, I'm sorry -That's better... Let's now have a look at our baby boy... You laugh, you sucker!

Camera... Music... Action! Fuck, that can't be happening! -How long are you there? -I just got upstairs! -Where have you been? -In the kitchen... -Want some coffee? -No, I'll have cigarette... I've left them somewhere here... Here... -Are you ok? -Yes, why? Just asking... -Remember what you told me last night? -About what? About the guy you killed in the subway... -Is it true? -Yes... Was it in the papers? I don't know... Where are the other two? I haven't seen them... I met them in the staircase this morning... didn't you see them? I was sleeping... When I woke up everybody was gone... What was it? -What? -The person you killed... I don't know... I just saw somebody's back, and I pushed it... I don't imagine you said anything to the guys... -Tell them what? I haven't seen them... I'm going for a coffee... Leave it... Yes? It's for you... Yes? Where are you? What are you doing there? You're ill! Wait a sec... Yes, I'll come, but I'm going to be late... Ok, I'll find a way to get there quick... Stay in the car, to stay warm... I'm coming... -I'm leaving... -I can see that! -Where to? -No idea! On an excursion! -Will you take the car? -Yes. Don't you reckon it's dangerous to move around with it? What can I do? I have to see him... Ok, wait for me downstairs... We'll leave together... Ok... -Are we safe in here? -What's up? -You're not going to see me again... -What happened? I think I'm being followed... Wait a second... Last night, somebody entered the house, and turned it upside down... And this morning, I saw somebody waiting outside my front door... Is any of your friends involved in drug dealing? No... However... it wasn't a good idea to come here... I should then wait until I see some of your own people... -...and bust all of you together... -You're right... But he can't be a cop... -How do you know? -I know... Whatever he is, we're going to have a lot of fun... Take this too... -It's too much! -I know... It's the last I have... Let me give you a hug... You've got fever, do you know it? What a story... You didn't ask me where I got the car from... -It is stolen... -How do you know? The window is broken... -What else? -No keys in the steering wheel! That's why I love you... What else? What else? I know your friends... So? Something is happening... I'm afraid... I don't know... Not again the same, you faggot! Come on, come on Andreas my boy... Enter you hunchback! My rest! Cigarette... Empty... Stay aside... -What is going on here? -Some terrific happening! Get her, big boy! She is... Psst! Rosa! -Marina... this is Rosa... -Hi! Hi to you too! Fuck it now... Where did you find this joke of a broad? Who is her? That's Marina, now do your thing! -Let's go in, got to tell you something... -Take it easy now, don't spoil it for me! -Is she your girlfriend? -No, she's the sailor's cannons! -Things are serious! -What is it? -Shall we go in? -Tell me here first, and then we go in... -Well... -Sophia killed a man -Where did you learn it from? -She told me... with every detail... -She said she trew him on the tracks, then the train ran over him and sqashed him You're bullshitting me... Andreas! Keep going... Come on, take this tramp away, he's such a nuisance! You mind your own business! What do I see? Things are evolving here? We open tin-cans too... What do you want? Keep going! -Something else too... -There's more? A guy... waiting under our window... I first saw him this morning... Where he now stands... Saw him twice more on the stairs... On the stairs? -What was he doing there? -I don't know, he was leaving... Do you think he's one of those who entered the house? -How should I know? -Allright, come with me... You set up the camera... -Buggers! What are you doing here? -Nothing! We found a guy who is watching the house! The character with the black coat? Some discovery! -Is he an acquaintance of yours? -What? What is she saying now? Andreas, we're in trouble... At last something to set us into movement... Look at that... He loves trouble... She's all we need now... -Argyris... -I can see her... Your girl, buddy... Hi... May I sit with you? Make your self comfortable... Allright... Not Allright... Shit... -All troubles came together... -Add your friend's story to all this... -Sophia's... -Who is Sophia? What's up with Sophia? Sophia is claiming that she killed a man... Come on, Argyris! Rosa? She's one of us, isn't she? Rosa? Ok! So she pushed him on the tracks, then the train ran over him... ..and squashed him... stories and stuff... I was right when I said that the broad had a loose nut... So the cop who is watching us... It's all for her then? -So it is connected? -Connected? He's trying to tell you that he's watching the house because Sophia killed a man And if the murder has something to do with the surveilance... -Isn't it so, Argyris? -It is so, but... -You are confusing us... -I reckon we should do something... -Like what? -Get him upstairs! -How? -Argyris, the window! Come! Get upstairs, you punk! Get upstairs, or I slit her throat right away! -Help! -(louder!) Help! He's coming up... Let's go to the staircase... Marina, at the window! What's wrong with her? -I'm fucking afraid! -Come... The blonde guy... We've been set up from upstairs... Marina, he got into a car, and he went away... He left with in a car, Rosa saw him... -Who put the music on? -I did. Coffee anyone? Who will strangle her now, me or you? We're some kind of circus in here, aren't we? Come on, close that thing before you lose a finger... -Who are you? -I am Rosa. You must be... Sophia? Yes... And what are you doing in here? I made some coffee for the guys... Excuse me, I need to pass through... What's going on in here? If everything's allright, why are you not speaking? -Are you ok? I'm fine! He just left... Are you telling me? -She pretends not to know... -What does this mean? It means that the character in the black coat just left. I reckon you shouldn't worry... He's probably some pervert... So, what now? Now you'll all pack your things, and hang around somewhere else... Because if you stay here you're in big trouble... Tell your girlfriend that I don't like at all the way she talks... Like it or not, I don't care... I pay the rent for this house, and all other shit on top, so I'll do what I want, ok? I think you're wrong, we have also put some money into this cot... Yeah, but I always threw the big bucks in... Like, you're the boss now... Since I'm the boss, I'm telling you to get out of here... Because this ordeal is not for small time crooks... -Who are the small time crooks? -Us, of course... I told you I don't like your girlfriend at all, didn't I? I really wonder how Stathis enjoyed her company... Don't you ever speak about Stathis -I ruined my life for Stathis and the likes of you -Shut up! -Shut up! -And when I got out of jail - no you shut up! And when I got out of jail, I found that Stathis had fallen from the penthouse to thepavement... -Argyris? -What? -As long as we were together, no fucker could touch him, and they took him from your hands.. -From between my legs, you mean... -Get lost, you slut! Andreas... Downstairs... -I reckon he takes it up the ass a bit... -You can say that again! Look at his shoes... Sportive, eh? Why do you laugh, you fucker? -He's clean... -The bugger is laughing... Who sent you to watch the house? Speak you fucking cop! Wait, Andreas, we've been set up... If we hit him, they have the excuse they need... -Calm down... -What is that bugger looking for? -What happened? -Nothing, all fine... Don't let her go out on her own... -Where are you going? -I want to see him up close. -You want to see him up close, eh? Argyris, you from the front. -It's him. -Get me closer. Very good... I don't think he smokes... -What do we do now? -Shut up! He's probably a pervert... Once you reckon you're the boss here... Make sure no thieves get into the house... Ok pal? -I want to get off. What's this now? Nothing, I want to get off... Please. You're not going anywhere... Like this we're not doing anything... -Why did we stop here? -Because you get off! Me? -Why? What have I done? -Nothing! You just get off! Rosa, I reckon our beautiful friendship comes to an end at this point... -In other words, "Rosa hit the road"... -Look, don't get it personally... We just are in trouble, so... Trouble, my ass! Come on Rosa, make yourself sparse... -Just like that, out of the blue... -What do you want, an orchestra playing music? Ok, we have a dignity to preserve... -Bye Rosa... -I was pleased to meet you, ok? Go fuck yourselves, assholes! Ok, let's move on... -We are listening... -Why me? Well, since you reckon you're the boss... Ok then... I want you all out of the house. I agree. I'm new in the company, so I don't think I have a say... -Despite this, I agree. -Well said. Cut the crap! -So, shall we leave? -You're not going anywhere. You're going to sit here, until we find a solution. And don't play stupid, ok? Outside the house we have a guy, and we don't know what he wants... Which one of us is he after? Does he bother you? The gentleman downstairs? No. Then we leave. -Like, shit hits the fan... -Totally. -Shit! -What happened? -Fuck it, don't turn around. -What's up, the cops are here? -Which cops? The chicks are here! -Chicks? Which chicks? -The ones we stole their wallets... -What's up? -Don't get up... Some meeting, don't you reckon, Argyris? -All ok? -Fine. -Say hello to Katia... -Katia... -So... -So... We'll sit nearby on a table, to watch over you... When you're done, come for a word or two... Not one or two... Much more... Like, how many? Around... 50 thousand... Take something out, it couldn't have been that much... Count them and you'll see... See you in a minute, ok? We'll be over there... -Let's go Peggy... -Let's go... Very well... I'm going to their table, because they're furious and they might start screaming... -What do you care? -Are we pals? No... What are you going to do? I'll stay... Your friend over there clearly stated that she'd better stay alone... My friend is neat and allright. That's why I'll stay with her, and let protest all she wants. What about you, and the other one over there... I... I will find shelter somewhere else... -Because Sophia asked you to leave? -Yep... Not because you got scared... Scared of what? The pal downstairs... Look, if Sophia needs help, all she has to do is say so. -So? -Go away. Something tells me your friend over there is very afraid... We are leaving... You're going to fuck on the yacht again? Any objection? I'll call you. We are leaving. And now? Now that we played tough and cool? What shall we do? I'm not going home with that guy waiting... Can you come with me tomorrow morning? Tomorrow morning we'll go wherever you wish... How shall we get through the night? Good morning! -What? -Can I come upstairs? Ok... Now! Open up! Fuck, open up! Help! Help! Open up! -Help! Open up! -Shut up! -Help! What are you doing! -Don't move! Remove the lid! Remove it! Remove it! Help! -Help! Help! -Come on! Let's get out of here! Help! Open up! -Whores! Open up! -Can't do it! -Whores! Fucking whores! Open up! -I nailed my dress in! -Hi Sophia! -Argyris, let me talk to you for a moment... What is she doing here again? She has a job proposition Why don't you just cut the crap? As if the guy outside was not enough, we have this dumb chick in the way. -Such foul language! She's such a tramp, I wonder how we tolerate her company... What kind of a job is that? It's around 300 - 400, gold pieces! And who guarantees we've not been set up? -Set up by whom and why? -By the cops! We'll get busted! What cops? We drive around in a stolen car, we beat the shit out of the guy... What cops? Forget about the cops now. When will the job take place? Ehm... Today... Hey, Rosa, it's today, isn't it? -Of course... -Today... So can't we learn the secret? You'll learn the secret... Our Rosa here... Knows a rich gentleman... Who happens to... ...greatly admire her... Yes, but, before you go any further, please tell the guys about the sharing... Ah, yes... Rosa wants 50%... -...and we get the remaining 50% -Oh, is that so! I reckon that's fair... Besides, it's her job... I'm in! I'm in too, guys. Everybody in? So, I have a plan... Here it is... The warehouse is in the middle. The job needs to be done after 21:30, so that the road is deserted. ...and nearby shops are all closed. Here, on the road, in the basement, is the warehouse. And it has 3 windows. So, 1, 2, 3. Stop! What is this thing over there? -Fuck, it's just a smudge! -Ah, ok. I'll leave the first window open, jump inside... You will pass through a long corridor... Cut it Andreas, leave my ass alone! But your ass is a masterpiece! -He makes me laugh! -Go on, keep speaking... Don't pay attention Rosa, please go on... You will jump inside, you will pass through a long corridor... ...first door on the left, I'll be there with the old guy. -All right? -Ok. Do you carry any weapon? Yeah, I do... -You don't like it here, do you? -I don't like it a bit. -Me neither. -Nobody asks me, huh? Get Sophia, and go up the stairs. -What about you? -We'll come from the side. Marina! Leave it, let's go to the large office. -Your friend! 50%! -Yeah, right! Come on, let's get on with it! Fancy that... key with a golden chain... So, read loud and clear... -5 right 3... -5 right, 1, 2, 3... -92 left 4 -92? -2, there, left, 4... -Hurry up! -Guys, hurry up, she'll run out of moves! -2... 3... Heaven... -Gifts from God... -Sophia! Gold pieces! -Cash... -Guys, the music! The music stopped! Andreas, go have a look! -Andreas! -What's up? Something happened to him, and he asked me to put this on his mouth... Ok, wait... -Grab a pillow... -From where? From an armchair! From anywhere! -What happened? -I don't know... she left him dead on the spot... -So he kicked the bucket? -I don't know... Start the car, and get it under the window, and I'm coming, ok? Ok, but make it quick! -Is there a phone somewhere? -There, on the desk... -Did you find the gold pieces? -Is this your greatest concern? Get out of here! -Where shall I go? -Down, at the warehouse, they're waiting for you. I have to change, I look like a clown like this! Get the hell out of here! Don't look like this, he can see you! That's what I want, to be seen! Argyris? -Rosa asks for her money... -What money? I tell her so myself... The money you got from the old man's safe... Did we get money from the old man's safe? Of course we didn't, that's what I'm telling her... As soon as we started searching, she started screaming... -So we stopped and left... -That's what you say! That's what we say, what do you say? I say that you got the money, and now you try to dump me. You try to say that we got the money, and now we pretend we don't have a clue? Exactly, you got the money, and now you pretend you don't have a clue. Andreas, Rosa asks for her money. What money? How should I know, pal? Allright, Andreas... Give 30%... -Lower your demands... -Rosa, get back to your senses! Why do you look at me? You had the deal with them, didn't you? Forget about it Rosa, we failed. You know something? You're a bunch of cocksuckers, and I regret meeting you. Want some chewing gum? Where to? No idea... I'm leaving... Where will you go? Where shall I go... Wherever I want... Go wherever you want... That's what I'll do... If you ever drop by the neighbourhood... You'll find a key in this flower pot... You get it, you open, you get in... You Andreas, were not fair... You, Rosa... 50%... Too much... Aren't we worth more? Goodbye... How many downstairs? -One... -You see just one... Do you know this? It's from "Fra Diavolo" Why doesn't that cocksucker do something, so that we can get on with it... He's doing... Who told you he isn't? First they'll tatter our nerves... And then they'll seal us in here... They'll stick it inside us like this: Ha! 4th Day That night, he rode again the Silver Porsche Spider... And poured into the highway with 100 miles per hour. Until he reached a turn on the road close to Paso Robles in California... He crashed it on a car... ...and his head separated from his body... Where are you going? Somewhere like... ...generally... to chill out... What's happening upstairs? Upstairs? All is Ok upstairs... Look... Look... If you want us to sleep together... It's ok... You know what? What? I don't like it like this... So how did you expect it to be? I don't know... I don't know... Some other way, just not like this... I'll go for a walk on the road... At least, if all this is happening not from fear or boredom... Or from... Camaraderie... Do you love me a little bit? Shhhh... No big words, didn't we agree on this? Right... So how does it happen with you? We unzip, unbutton the trousers... Pop! We're done? I can't afford more! Allright... Listen now, the anatomy lesson... This is the brain... The brain, which is hungry for truth, and we never give it enough of it... and it never gets satiated... And this is the belly, which is hungry for food. And this down here is the sex. Which is hungry for love, because it gets lonely from time to time. In my life I fed them, I satiated all three, as much as I could, and as much as I wanted. You might have satiated your belly a little... With sage tea, of course... But regarding truth... love... Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Only bloated words, and antics and posture... He lets go of her hand... The lesson is over, ok? You can go now... What's happening downstairs? Look for yourself. Put the phone down... -Why? -Put it down I said! Why? Because it's being monitored, that's why... And what am I supposed to do? I have to call somebody... You'll use a payphone, outside. Where is Argyris? He's busy downstairs. Say how much... -What should I say... ok... -What should he say? He should say... -150? -Right away, too... You'll get the camera too, otherwise forget about it. Allright, allright, put the camera in too. -How much? -300. -200? -Ok. And the nose is yours. -I said 300... -Come on! Come on! Nonsense! So... 300 for all this, and you'll include 2 mopeds in the packet. Those guys that loiter outside the house... Who's men are they? Clients... What do they want? What's up? The guys got a hard time downstairs... We've got movement today! They'll kill us in broad daylight! After that they'll plant a few bags of heroine in our pockets... And they'll call it gang warfare... Wankers! Fucking thing! Junkies and so on... Your friend is a bit overreacting, don't you reckon? Sneaky prick? You, who monitor the phone... I'm going to rip your asshole apart, you listen? Good one? A number one! -Going somewhere? -Got to something to do with Sophia. What shall you do? He'll come with me. Come, get some. I won't be late. Like, how long will it take? Here, an hour from now. Ok. They wrote a song about him back then, that said... "You're not allowed to live over 30" He was too fast to live, and too young to die. Are you alone? This is Sophia. I need to leave the house. Look, if things were not that tight, I'd never bother you, ok? I drag three people behind me, and they need not pay for our sins. No. All of us, or nobody. Yes, give me the address. Your friends have sent us to a very nice place... We were supposed to hide in here? Quickly, let's get out of here. -Where's our man? -I can't see his face anywhere. Do you reckon they'll ambush us in the stairway? We'll see... -Second... -First. -Third. -Second? -First? -Second. -First? -This is yours. What motherfucker did this? Don't do anything crazy. -Where to, Sophia? -I know where I'm going, let me go! Come inside, please, the girl needs help, they've harmed her badly. Be careful! Argyris! Rosa, who did it? Was it the blonde guy? Marina, grab a blanket! Who was it? Was it the blonde guy? -Yes! -Were others with him? -There were others? -Yes! Argyris come here. -Where shall we go? -To a hospital. Anywhere. Are you going to leave us here on our own, me and Sophia? I'll take her with me, you stay here. -You stay here. -Let me go! Carry her carefully, like this... What was that for? Because soon you go too. What do you have in mind? My mind's full of shit , but you have to go. And make sure you keep the guys out of the house until the morning. Sure. Sure. You put her down, I'll be back. If Rosa dies, you die. If she survives, you still die. So don't go... I'll be back soon. Ok? 5th Day. You whore! What have you done? -What happened? -Nothing, please get out. -Is Sophia ok? -Sophia is ok, she's having a bath. Then why don't you let me in? -Something happened to Sophia! -Sophia is allright. What was that? Please get out, and we're too coming out soon. What have you done, you crazy woman? Nothing. I killed him a little. You killed him a little... Ok, now come outside... I think we have to dump him somewhere. And where shall we dump him? In some creek, or in a well somewhere outside the city. None of these options is possible. The blond guy is assigned to us. And they'll come to us to look for him In other words, we're talking about murder. -What is happening upstairs? -How should I know? He's still alive, breathing and so on. Good. Let him suffer for a while... ...because he played smartass to us... Any of you who wishes to leave, should do so now. Because the walking dead will soon swarm here, and seal us in here. What are you trying to prove now? You know we're all up to here into your shit. I'm in! I'm in too. You should see how much I'm in... I'm deep inside! Let's listen to some music now, so that you leave nicely... What are you doing here? We listen to some music! Why don't you do something, Andreas? Can't you see he's suffering? He's allright now! Can't you see? He's chatting with God! Let the motherfucker, he might learn something... Somebody should close the door on the rooftop. ...because they might get in from there. -Did anybody ask her? -Of course not. -What is she saying? -Let her say... She thinks that if we close the rooftop door, she'll keep them all out. The road is empty, but not for long. If you should go, go now. Are you coming back? Do you know any other place for me to go? Where shall you go, you idiot... Here you are... Are they the ones? Do you have a permit? Huh? Do you have a permit? Permit for what? For the gun! A permit is needed? Of course! Of course! To the corner! Come on! -Take it easy, girl, it's loaded! -Quick, to the corner! -Take it easy! -Move faster! -Come Argyris! -Yeah! -Marina watch him. -Get back! Get back, cocksucker! Back, hurry up! Back! Turn around! Down on your knees! -Turn around and on your knees! -Take it easy! -I said down! -Take it easy, it's loaded! Come on Argyris! I said down! We're done. Turn against the wall! Turn around! Argyris! The house is surrounded! Go away! -Argyris? -He's coming. It's nothing, let's go. Sophia, to the stairway! Andeas! Sophia? What? Are you hungry? Shall I get you something to eat? Send somebody upstairs, to guard the rooftop door. Argyris? Yes? Put some music on... Loud, so that I can hear it... Did you listen, Andreas? I've listened, but forget it. We have no electricity. One - Two... One - Two... So, guys, the house is surrounded. You've got two minutes to drop your guns, and come out with hands up. Over... Over... Assholes! What is happeining outside? Go sit upstairs... When will those motherfuckers come? Don't worry about them, they're always punctual with their appointments... As soon as the light goes down, the fucking assholes will show up. What about us? Hey, pssst! So, how did you get into this mess? How should I know? Stathis is dead, anyway... How did he die, girlfriend? What does it matter? I'd like to know how I should remember him... If you live to remember him... You're right... It was four o'clock in the morning... They smashed the door in... All quiet? Who shot upstairs? Them, from outside. They killed a mannequin. Sophia! Don't pick it up! Put it down, Sophia! Get up! Get away, through the rooftop... I'll stay here... The rooftop leads nowhere... Are you crazy? How did you do this? It's nothing... Marina? Do me a favour... Where is Marina? Marina left for downstairs. Bring Sophia nearby... Yeah, right... It's ok... Take me close to her... Allright? That fucking sun... It will never set... Don't let the fuckers get inside... We must not live like this, buddy... THE END
