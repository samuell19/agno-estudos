"Chance is fickle," you once told me. It was the first time I'd stayed under for so long in my tub at home. Under water... submerged, I'd just found my favorite place. I was only four. But I could hold my breath for a long time. You were 19. And you were giving me a bath like every afternoon. Nothing happened, but the fright would never leave you. Because you never took your eyes off of me again, Yari. Yarisa. Yes. Nice name. Thanks. Hope we see you again. Look at those, they're beautiful. That's still full of sand, look. Clean them, please. Thank you. You're too kind. You're welcome. Luckily, you're with us. What do you suggest? Egg, honey. No. What did you ask? Ham and cheese. Okay, give me one of those. I don't mind following my parents, leave Santo Domingo, if you stay with us. To my family, coming here is a beginning. But for you it means coming back. Nice to see you, Santa. What are you doing around here? Damaris. Looking good! Saw Flora yesterday, she didn't tell me you were here. You've seen her? Not yet. You're going to love your daughter's new haircut. Yes, Damaris. She's beautiful! I won't take more of your time. Talk to you later. It's great that you came back. Coming back scares you. And when you're like that, scared, you get angry at me. Don't throw away your future out of fear! As if everything was a mistake. As if we were united only by the accident of you showing up at my house when I'd just been born. Tell me, Yari. Answer. Tell me it can't just be that... chance. How is it I find out you're here from Damaris' gossip? That she ran into you. They decided to move here last minute a few days ago. So you've been here already a few days and nothing. Just five days, I was going to tell you. Damn it, Mom. You're terrible. Come see me. Since you won't, then I'll come see you. No way, Mallory. This is my place of work. You know I don't like that shit. Wait for the weekend. They do understand you have a family, don't they? Shut up, there's someone here. Who's that? Your daughter? Mrs. Laura. Hi. Hello. Is it true I can't come see my mom later? Of course you can. Is she gone? Yeah. See you later then, bye. Yarisa! Sure, it's great to chill at the beach, but I can't stand people talking shit about this in the city. Shut up. Look at what happened yesterday in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia... There are lots of family men behind bars and for nothing, for way smaller contracts. Enough of that, gentlemen. So let's calm down. I want you to tell me when we can get in again. But in the meantime, we're fine here. Madam! Are these for the back too? I won't get up now. Is that for the event on Saturday? Uh-huh. The congressman is in the peninsula. Let me know if you need anything. He should have a good time. Pass me that. How is it you come visit us on the beach without a bathing suit? Lend me one. Lend you one of mine? You think that body of yours fits in one of mine? And Diego? He's fine. Aha... I heard he was around here. Is he? I didn't know. Sure you didn't. Just finding out. He's going to be there, right? Yeah, he is. Uh-huh... That has nothing to do with it. The smile on your face says it all. Yes, he's going, yes. You need to tell me a few things. Oh. You'll tell me all when you come back. I can't tell you everything! Aha? He's my friend. Don't give me that story. No. Friend? Uh-huh. The way you look at him? What? The same way I look at you. If you must know. Like this? I don't look at him like that. Uh-huh, sure. I've caught you a few times. I look at him like this. Look at me. Hello. Hello. My love! You're early! Yeah. How are you? I thought you were coming at nine. Yeah, well. Come in. Sorry for the mess. You try. Use both hands. Show me. Like this. You've been here five days. Mallory. I've been gone longer than that. You could've told me. You know I was working. That's not an excuse. You could've called and say you were coming. You came here to make me feel bad? No, I just want to know why you didn't say anything. You think I don't know there's something else? Tell me. Talk to me. I know there is. I was afraid. Afraid? Yes. Of me. Of you. Of Flora. Scared? That I... That I wouldn't have a family to come back to. Why do you say that? You're my mom no matter what you've done. I'll love you anyway. God, you've grown up. Don't do it again. You got to let me know next time, okay? What's your favorite smell? Coconut. You smell like coconut. Yeah. It's an oil I bought. I love it 'cause, well, it's coconut. It smells great. Thanks. Always coconut, nutty coconut. I can drive you home. No, I'll get off where you go, and I'll walk from there. Don't worry. It's not that far. Exactly, I'll drive you. Do you smoke? Here. Press the button. It's not bad. Tastes like cake. It's vanilla. It's good. Do you remember we came here a long time ago and Yarisa brought you? Tell me. You won't remember, you were too little. Try me. We went to the beach, and you were hunting crabs. Remember? You tied some bread to a string. And then stuck it into the crab's holes in the sand. When the crab grabbed the bread, you'd pull it out. Damn. Then you'd grab them from behind. Yeah, I remember. You'd grab them from behind. We grabbed the pincers so they wouldn't get us. Remember that? Yeah. You were such a little chicken. You didn't like it. I always wanted to try. Shit, fucking dog! Damn, Álvaro! Dear God. That dog's drunker than I am. I think you're driving me tonight, Sara. Do you want to come with us? Huh? To the party. Is it going to be really good? It's going to be lit! Sara, Sara! Here, you're driving. You take me home. You're crazy, Álvaro. Having fun? Yeah. What do you think about the party? It's cool, you know. Come on! Drinks are on me tonight! Harder, harder, harder! Jump, jump, jump! Jump, jump, jump! Jump, jump, jump! Hi. Bored already? No, I was looking for a dog that went that way. I don't see any dog. He came from the party and passed me by. He looked drunk. You didn't see it? No. You didn't? No. Really? So, what's up? Weren't you going away to college soon? I'm not sure yet. I don't think I will. And you? You finished school? Yeah. What are you going to do? What are you going to study? I want to open a salon. A salon? Yes, hair, nails, all that. Can I see them? Sure. I can do them for you. I don't think they'd look good on me. What do you mean? Why not? I'll do them for you. No. I don't know... I don't think they're my style. But thank you. You know nobody calls her Yari? That's your family's thing. Everyone knows her by Santa in the neighborhood. What does my mom do with you? Does she clean, cook, and fix your room? No. It's been a long time since she's fixed my room. And what else? Does she laugh with you? Tells you things, jokes? Yeah. We laugh a lot. She has a lot of interesting opinions. Does she fart with you? Yeah. She farts so much all the time, but you ask her, and she refuses! I know, right? She says, "No, of course not." She looks at you cluelessly. Yeah. She always does that, and she blames me too! I look at her clueless. Yeah. Literally! Does she love you? Yes. She loves me. But she also talks a lot about you. Yeah? What does she say? She shows me pictures of you. She says, "Look how beautiful my girl is." She does? Yeah. Well, I'll go grab another drink and then I'll head home. Are you sure you don't want a ride? No, it's not that far. I can walk. Okay, fine. Look! The dog! What happened? Listen. The only thing that deal's missing is a conversation. You think you can help me? Diego, he's corrupt. You shouldn't talk that way about your dad. He's your family, your blood. Whatever, shut up. Won't we ever be able to talk about that? I don't get why you want to work for a corrupt man. He and I talked about it. There's a spot open on the communications team. Where the fuck are we? This country needs more men like him. Men who'll do whatever necessary. Your dad's an idol. Shit! What the hell! Damn. What the fuck is this? Look, look, Diego. What? Hey, is it possessed or what? Hey, honk at it. Yeah. What should I do? Keep honking at it. I don't want to scare it. Honk it. What the hell, man? Come on, let's go. Where's my kiss? Get out. You just puked. Give me a kiss. No! Go! Fine. Your loss. Thanks for the ride. Sure. Don't you wink at me! What are you doing? Diego, come on, it's raining. Go, go to bed. Come on, Diego! Álvaro is going to kill me if I don't go back now. Shut the door! Damn, Álvaro! Hold on! Álvaro! What are you doing, man? Brave Quisqueyans, let's raise What are you doing? Okay, hush. Sorry, Yari. Kids... Rained a lot? The yard's a mess here. You know how Mom's afraid of thunderstorms. Listen, Flora, I was just calling to see how my girl's doing. What do you mean "what girl"? Mallory. Yes, she was here yesterday. Don't speak to me like that. She must be with a friend. I'll ask the kids here. She left with them yesterday. No. Flora. Damn you, Flora! Go back to bed! Back off! I told you! Do you want to fight me today? Sara. Sara. Sara. Yarisa, Mrs. Laura is looking for you. Doña... I'm afraid. Get your phone. There's a mess down there. I told you, Dad. Everyone's asleep in that house. What's going on? Sara, honey. Do you know if she stayed there last night? Call Renata and ask her if Mallory's there. Mallory? Yes, Mallory. "On my way walking. Be there in 20." That's what she wrote her aunt? Her cousin, they all live together. She texted she was going home. Maybe she changed her mind. Sometimes I say I'm going out and I stay longer. Especially these kids. If my daughter says she's on her way, it's because she is. She doesn't pick up? No. Any news? No. Nothing. Maybe she has a boyfriend. I used to disappear a lot at her age. My mom was always going crazy like you are. Don't worry, she's probably with a boy. Didn't you see her leave the party? Hello, Mario! Finally. What's up? No, I just wanted to know if some kids stayed over last night. Not mine. Mine are here. It's about a friend of theirs. Yes, so we'll clear up our doubt. It stinks? I'm sure, all those sweaty feet. Tell him to check Renata's room. She's black. Her hair's got like a little afro. I'd wake them all up with a shotgun blast. Nine in one bed? Damn, you're so modern in that house. Yari! Yari! Yari, what's wrong? Call you back. Yarisa... Yarisa. Here, turn right. Pedro, what about the party? Should I call it off? We can't. The congressman said he'd come. Text Hipólito to go home and set it up. Here, it's the yellow house. It was a little hard, sir. The girl was all covered in mud. It rained a lot, we were only able to see her well when the water went down. A man saw her legs sticking out next to the road. She was all dressed... Yes. But very beaten up. The doctor assumes it was probably a hit and run. For instance... When he examined her, he noticed several broken ribs. Do you understand, sir? Yes. When she was hit and fell, her face ended up submerged in a puddle. When we pulled her body out, and we turned her over, a lot of water came pouring out of her lungs. It was quite confusing, at first. Where did you find her? Excuse me? Where did you find her? In the shortcut to Cosón Bay, the one that goes to Aires del Mar. Okay. Around 300m from where it joins with the new highway. Anything else, sir? No, thank you for your help. We'll call you if anything. At your service. Who identified the body? Is it as he says? I think so. We'll take care of all the expenses. No, you've already done so much. Don't worry. I'll take care. Thank you. We accept. Thank you, sir. We'll take care of it. Do you think they'll release the body to you? I tried, but I couldn't get it. We want her body here, so we can mourn her as she deserves. How's that? Haven't they released it? They said they needed a DA to sign it, and there was no one. I'll find out. I'll take care of it. Who are you calling? Don't worry. Everything you know. We have to accept God's will. He is the only one who knows how things happened. We have to accept God's will. We have to. We are all going there someday. Accept it. Stay calm. Calm. I'm so sorry. This woman's burning up. We're going to lose her. Where's Sara? I don't know. I want to see her. That brat? Now? That's who you want to see? Stay here. Rest. I'm so sorry, sister. I'm so sorry. What a tragedy. But we have to accept God's will. We are all going to him someday. We have to accept God's will all right. She was such a good girl. Oh, my girl! My girl. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Hey. What happened to your eye? Nothing important. Was it at the party? Yes. We kind of drank too much. And you know... Things got a little out of control. But I'm fine. Did you notice anything weird about her at the party? Mallory? Aha. I saw her have a good time. She even danced with me. Did she disappear at any point? Not that I know of. Why did you leave her there? What? She said she was walking. I know, but you know it's dangerous at night. And it was raining. I don't remember much from last night. I was drunk. Fine, you were drunk, but you got home alive. And you do remember things anyway. You just told me she said she was walking home. What can I say? I'm nobody's nanny. What did you just say? That you're nobody's nanny? What are you then? I'll tell you. You're a piece of shit. What? You're a shit of a man. Do you think it was a piece of shit you left there? Tell me. Say something, damn it. Calm down, girl. I won't calm down! Want to know why? Because nobody's bringing me my cousin back! No matter what happens here, no one will bring her back! It's fair this shithead understands. I understand your pain, but my son has nothing to do with this. Of course he's responsible! If he'd driven her home she'd be alive! I had no idea what she was doing, man. Of course you did, fucker! Calm down. Let's go. You said it! She wanted to walk here. Are you stupid or what? You had a car! You could've easily brought her! But you left her there, because why should you care? You shouldn't. But you should've at least cared out of respect to Yarisa! Damn it! At least out of respect to her, who dedicated her life to serving you, to wiping your asses! Huh?! She neglected her daughter here to go care for you. And you come here with this shit? Are you fucking crazy? You need to learn to love others! That's what I want you to understand! Do you think it's fair that this place is empty? It's not fair! Mirta, what's going on in there? Is there a problem? Tell me, do we have to do something? Tyron. What happened here? It wasn't me. Tell me. What's that? Tell me. What happened? Did you break this? It wasn't me. Tell me, honey. I just pulled at it and it came off. It was like that. Don't tell me you broke those people's light. It was like that. Touch it, you'll see. You're not lying to me? It wasn't him. You know I'll smack you. It was broken already? You sure? There's no glass on the floor. Did you break it all off, or just a piece? Tell me the truth. Just a piece. Just a little. Why can't you keep still? Get out of here now, go! Sara! We're running late, aren't we? We'll be in time. They're coming. "Chance is fickle," you told me that day. I want to know how you're doing. Where you are. At the burial, I guess. Surrounded by your family. I want you to know that I'd love to hug you. That when all of this is over you can come back home. We'll be waiting for you. I love you. I feel a mixture of pride and fear. I feel alive. Well, we both feel like that. Honey, we're busy. Wait for us outside, please. Wait for us outside. You're saying it like if it were weird. You're offending me. So the cat stares at the corner, and what? Cats have instincts we don't. They do things. I don't know who's higher, Renata or the cat. But it could be they have a demon. They can sense earthquakes. But they don't see paranormal stuff. What's wrong? Hey, what's going on? Talk to me. I killed Mallory. The other day after I drove you home. I ran her over. In the road to Cosón. Who is Mallory? Yarisa's daughter. Isn't that where all those goats were? It wasn't a goat, Diego. How are you so sure? Did you see her? Did you see her face specifically? Are you sure? You didn't see anything? Okay, then. Did anyone see you? No. Have you told anyone else? What are you so worried about then? What the hell, Sara? I need to tell Yarisa. Are you crazy? Do I need to worry? Are you trying to ruin your life? You tell her that, and you lose her forever. You'll never see her again. She'll never talk to you again. You understand? She's going to hate you. Do you like that people hating you? Hey, do you remember the house we had in Jarabacoa? One day, when I was little, during the summer, I was playing in the yard, and there was a beehive that bothered me. I was going to tell the guard to knock it down, but the irresponsible man was not there. But his son was, Brayan. So I ordered him to do it. He climbed up high with a stick and fell. He cracked his skull open, and died. I saw it. I saw the blood. And what I did was go to my room and study because I had a report to do. So... I got an A on my report, and you hit a goat. Got it? That's all. A goat. A goat. I abandon this lost ground To a nicer ground I'll go To drink from the life giving water When will we get there? You have to do what I told you. After the curve that's to the right of the stream. I'm saying we can look in both directions. To the right. Fine, it's like you say, then. People, we're getting there. Jesus came for him Don't look for him in... Mirta! They found it! Mirta! I'm coming! Where? There's something. Come, Mirta, look. Let me see. It's here. Come see! Look for more! There must be more! Look for more! They killed you, my daughter! Keep that, that's proof! There's more! There's more! See? Justice! Justice must be done. We have proof. Santa! There's more proof. Oh, Father, dear Lord. Look for more. Check over there. Take a look there. Santa! We need to get justice! Where is Santa? What is she doing there? Here it is. We need to keep looking. There's more. Alberto, why is Santa not coming? I don't know. She should come see. These are pieces of the plastic. It was them, Santa! She doesn't believe you. She's left us. She's not with us, with the family. Understand it, please. Who's she with then? She is not with you. She is not with the family. She hasn't been with you for a long time, Mirta. She's far away. Yarisa. What are you doing here? Sara. Sara. Sara. Sara. Wake up, it's late. Yarisa's here. What? Yes. Why? She's been here for six hours. She's locked in her room. I guess she's resting. I need your help cleaning up the kitchen. Shouldn't she be with her family? Yes, I don't get it. I don't want her to wake up and start cleaning. I don't want her to think we're disgusting. The kitchen? We're not like that. Will you help me, my good girl? Sara! Sara! Everything's closed now. I'm trying to order food, but they won't pick up. I'm so hungry. Is Álvaro up? How should I know? You didn't clean anything back there... You do it, then. Or tell Álvaro to do something for once. That's not how it is. Hello? Do you have... What happened? Let me see. Look. Let me see. Come here. God knows where those tables have been. Did you get your tetanus shot? I don't know. What do you mean? You need to know. I'm not a library. You need to know what goes into your body. What's this blood on the floor? Your sister got hurt. Álvaro, baby, I need you to help me with those tables. What? Uh-huh. I don't want Yarisa to get up and start working. Yarisa? Yes. Help me, please. Relax. Does it hurt? No. Try to open and close. Come on. Close, open. Relax. I brought you vitamins and proteins. Your niece was right. I forgot about Mallory. I like to start early. I start drinking at 4pm to get that feeling that everything's alright. All done. Like when we put the last piece to the puzzle we used to play with when we were little... It's like, "Check. All ready to go." Pure magic. I don't know. When I get to a party, and everyone's drinking, dancing, and smoking... I feel complete when we connect like that. And that's how Mallory was at the party. She danced the most, she laughed the most. It showed she was having fun. She had a little cocktail umbrella in her ear. She was the only one without makeup, yet she was the brightest. And I keep drinking, and drinking and after a while, I notice nobody is paying me any attention. And I'm alone. You see this bruise? I don't care to be beaten. I say what I want and I do what I want. If the punch comes, it comes. And maybe from getting the shit kicked out of me, I forgot about Mallory. Your niece is totally right. I should've driven her home after the party. And I didn't. You'd better get out, Álvaro. Yarisa. Were you able to rest all that time you were in there? A little. Did you eat? There are lots of leftovers. I have some pills if you want to go back to sleep. Where's Sara? Sara. I haven't seen her in a while. And the mister? Is he with her? No, I haven't seen him in a while either. How is Sara? Not good at all. She doesn't talk, she doesn't do anything. But it's weird. I already told her you were here. I thought she'd be with you. Yarisa, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at your sister's? Everything okay? Yes. Oh, look, the phantom of the opera! Where were you? Running some errands. Nothing important. You? How are you doing? Drowning in heat and abandonment. It's going to be a long summer. Where's Sara? Heat and abandonment, Pedro. Yarisa, what you're doing's not okay. I understand it must be tough. You're disoriented. But I can't have you working. Let's go. Pedro. Please, love, sign over here. Where is Sara? You didn't answer. How should I know? Come out! Come out, damn you! Come out, Sara! Let the devil take me, fuck it! Look at me, damn it, look at me! Where are you?! Look at me! Look at me, Sara! Damn it, come out! Damn it, Sara! Somebody tell me why! Sara. Sara. Come.
