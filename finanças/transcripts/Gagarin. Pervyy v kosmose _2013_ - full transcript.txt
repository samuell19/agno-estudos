Turn off the light. Greetings, Sergey Pavlovich. Those flights hinder work. Do people work? That's right, Sergey Pavlovich, work.

The student is very worried. Anatoliy Grigoryevich, What does "concerned" mean? Cry or what? Suppose you cry. He says he cannot live without heaven. What do you propose to me? Fly well, with courage and confidence. It only costs him the landing. I know it flies well ... but it will kill and destroy the plane. Listen, you tried putting something on it under the butt? �He believes that due to his short stature Do you have problems with your viewing angle? But you say "fly well", then on landing you don't see the ground. Think of something, Grigorievich. North-1, you can land now. �Sergeant Gagarin, I have completed flight training! We already realized that. For its unmistakable application in flight exercises. Also by determination, work and Sergeant Gagarin's stagecoach. The command under my command has arranged allow Sergeant Gagarin ... ... fly on your own with a new military rank. Well, it has been promoted. What was not prepared? Yura, shall we smoke? Of course.

I only listen to you. Sergey Pavlovich, there is no KP3 signal. What does that mean? It means there is ... a possible depressurization of the cabin. No contact signal on the hatch cover. Why don't they report, how are things going? Sergey Pavlovich, we are done to install the hatch cover. Is the lid straight or inclined? No, Sergey Pavlovich, everything is normal.

How are things here? Everything in order, Sergey Pavlovich. Code 5, does it mean everything in order? Yes, Sergey Pavlovich. What about code 4? Code 4, the depressurization. Code 3, engine failure.

Knowledge never It's enough. Here comes the rocket. Hurry! Come on! First cosmic ... Second cosmic ... Thank you, soldier. Let's go to study. That was good. Let's go. On earth we cannot answer the question... � Man can live in conditions normal without gravity? Your brain may work without gravity? �I will not lose capacity to act reasonably ... - Under the influence of spatial fear? - B3. Those responses are still pending. - And finally ... - �6. Will support the cosmonaut's psychic from earth and from space? Can you play Associate? I know all the games! Sun. Tundra. Story. Mom. Song. Friends. Horror. Hungry. Joy. Children. The separation occurred! The cosmic ship with a man on board I entered orbit! Now I do. Please! How are you, brother Konstantin? I mistreated you a little in these years. � Congratulations on the flight, Sergey Pavlovich! You are a jerk. All my life I dream with this and the one who flew was him. I have never envied anyone, but I envy him! Did they forget? We still have to lower it. The descent is still missing! Did they forget that they still should it come down from orbit? Did they forget? We will lower it! ABKHASIA, PITSUNDA Nikita Sergeyevich, Korolyov, he's online. Give it to me. Korolyov, How are things there? Gagarin ... Did you enter orbit? Gagarin is in orbit, the flight runs normally. Well, well ... Very well, Sergey Pavlovich! Take care that everything is of first class. They don't just say that in your Odessa, but also in my Kiev. Everything will go as planned. Now let him be dysfunctional Comrade Levitan. Nikita Sergeyevich, you must not shake, you have blood pressure ... What pressure, or nothing? Now everyone will be under pressure! Contact me with Malinovskiy! Let me know with Marshal Malinovskiy. Malinovskiy, until when Will the first cosmonaut be a lieutenant? We will promote him to captain, Nikita Sergeyevich. How captain? �Prepare an order to promote it to greater! It is not allowed, Nikita Sergeyevich. Why is it not allowed? In the Army there are 100,000 captains, they will be offended. Rodion ... Do you understand what the magnitude is? of this event? It is interplanetary! We will be forgotten, but they will remember this forever. Understood, Nikita Sergeyevich. Very good! Yurka, stop it! You broke my wings again. Boriska ... Boriska, stop! I will make you a new plane. Leave me! Don't you want to be a pilot? Boriska! Leave me! Boriska! Mom ... What? I want to eat. What's wrong with you? Be patient, dear. I can not. I want to eat!

It's over, it's over ... Calm down, calm down. I told them not to come close to that house. He could ... Yura! Fool. # The homeland hears ... # # The motherland knows ... # # In what cloud ... # # ... your son flies. # # With friendly affection ... # # ... and a tender love. # # The scarlet star ... # # ... of the Muscovite towers. # # From the Kremlin tower ... # # She cares... # # ...of you. # # She cares... # # ...of you. # The rocket exploded on the launch pad. Due to a loss on the fuel line. People died, burned alive ... The tragedy occurred due to technical failures and elementary human errors. They must know and understand the possible consequences. Sergey Pavlovich ... So they postponed launching the ship? The rocket that exploded is not ours section, but we also ... ... we have problems with the system life supply and ejection. We need additional releases, before sending one of you into space. Come "More sweat during peace, less blood during the war. " What? Sergey Pavlovich, I say that it is better to prepare well. Prepare for what? It will turn out that the first to the space will be the Americans. Launching your ship is scheduled for March ... ... but it's not a fact that will happen. Also, it will be a sub-orbital flight ... It will not last more than 15 minutes. We understand it, but How will we explain to the world? We can't lose to them! Send me, I am willing to die for it! Do you think you are the only hero? �Yes? I am not the only one. We are all ready to fly! Of course everyone. I am not willing! I don't need human victims without sense. Lenochka, you are so much like dad. I can stay tomorrow with her, if you want? What is this? Yura wants to have a boy, but I think I'll be a girl again. What name will they give it? If it is a girl, it will be Galochka. A beautiful spring name. Lenochka, Do you want to have a little sister? Girls, I just found out ... Great news! - Which one? - What? Valyushka, don't worry, yes? Now you can't worry. Lenochka, Len, please go play in your room, okay? Yes, Lenochka, come on. Go fast. Speaks. Girls, I figured it all out. Out of twenty, they chose six. Kartashov, he has fragility in the blood vessels. Now he has a bruise in the back. Varlamov became dislocated the cervical spine ... - Understood, who did you choose? - And Yura? It's on the list ... Your German is also on the list. We have to think on how to celebrate it. Don't you understand? Sooner or later any of them will be sent to certain death. And what do you propose? We should write him a letter ... ... to Kamanin. From us wives ... Asking that on the first flight be sent a bachelor. For example, Bykovskiy ... Or Nikolayev. Okay? I personally am against it. It seems to me that is not correct. There lived a poor gentleman ... It was quiet and simple ... He looked sad and pale ... - Intoxicated and upright in spirit ... - Brave and upright. Ada, look, German is longer than Bykovski. Yes, yes, come on German, just a little bit more. Let's go. He had a vision ... Impossible to understand ... - And a deep feeling ... - And a deep feeling ... It penetrated his heart. Stop, stop! Let's take it out carefully! The head, hold the head, take him to the stretcher. It's all, take off his shoes. Loosen the camouflage. �Very good, German Stepanovich! �The result exceeds in two minutes to Bykovski's! Come as you try. All right, German. It shows that man wants to go into space. What are you talking about, Grisha? And who does not want? - You ...? - Maybe you don't want to? So far, it is the best result of the detachment. Two hours and six minutes. Very good! Very good! �Ada Ravgadovna, Nelyubov is losing his pulse! And why don't you take care of it, then? Stop! Open! Help us! Come on! Come on, over here! - Head up. - Take it easy! Over here, to the stretcher. - Carefully. - Gray! - Grisha. - Gray! Carefully. He recovers, he recovers, recovers, recovers! Salt aromatic! - Gray! - Higher your head. - Yeah, yeah, yeah ...! - Come on, Grisha! - Come on! - Hold on! - Come on! Come on! - Sveta, don't get upset ... - Calm down. - Come on! Come on! He's coming to himself, Grisha! Gray! Very good. It's better. It comes back to itself. There it is. How much? More than all, Grisha, two hours and eight minutes. So am I the best? Grisha, you almost died, they had to revive you. Was nothing. You mean what ... am I not the first? You know, Grisha, we did not decide. Here, we are all first. Spring, here Cedar, I can not hear you. Spring, here Cedar, over. Alba-3, Alba-3, here Cedro. Change. Alba-3, can you hear me? It is understood. I hear it with satisfaction. How does the flight take place? The machine works perfectly, the flight proceeds normally. I continue with the orbital flight. Greetings to the blonde. You are not blonde Are you redheaded. Not... I'm blond. Do you want to listen? We see how it approaches the ladder ... The plane door opens. Down the ladder those young heroes, cosmonauts. On their smiling faces there are traces of tiredness. Traces of tension with which they had to face incredible difficulties ... It's just what I thought! - Wait, someone already made the flight? - Silence silence. ... between 10 and 15 victims. When an unknown force ... No, why don't we know anything? Silence! ... increasing its mass in dozens of times ... Where is the release of the government? Must be... The people of our country, with love, pride and admiration ... - They look at those young heroes ... - Must be... - Which opened a new era ... - Must be the reservists. ...in the history of humanity. Well... They just heard a radio theater from the literary club ... ... lovers of science fiction, "Prometheus". Greetings from the future. - It was a radio theater. - I already knew. No. I thought no one told us anything and we are here like ... Lyoshka, I seriously believed it. Too bad it was theater and not reality. I was happy for them, for your return. Do you really not want to be the first? I want. Of course I want to! I would do anything to reach the end. There is something I do not understand, you want to be the first ... and you are happy for others. I don't know .... How do you not know? How does that combine? I don't know, work it out for yourself. How do I solve it? Why do we not choose the best? Of course. Clear, Gera, come on. And you, call the others. Mars, bring the hat here. Boys, come on everyone here! Grisha, prepare the pieces of paper. Please take a pencil. Well, young eagles! We will fly a lot, I'm sure. Comrade director, allow me a question. Speaks. We will fly into space on a rocket or how? It won't be on a broom. Let's see, young eagle, tell us about yourself. My name is Mars. Well, consider that Mars, It's in the hat! Come on, put the pieces of paper in the hat. Put everyone. I haven't written yet ... Everyone, everyone, everyone. - Did they all write? - Let me put it on. - We already have contact. - Bring on, boys, bring ... I'm still missing. - There it is. - Another piece of paper. So, let's go. Titov, German Stepanovich. Congratulations! Thank you. - All right. - Go on. Mars Rafikov! I recognize that letter. Sure, he voted for himself. Gagarin! There will be a winner. Gagarin. - Yurka! - Yes, Gagarin. Gagarin. - Again, Yurka? - Yes. I told you. - Gagarin. - They go 25. Tempo, tempo. High, higher. Stop, stop, stop, stop! Gagarin, make it higher, higher. Let's go. Okay! So, let's continue ... With joy, with joy. Gladly, boys. Stop, stop, stop, stop! Boys, every person You must have a dream. I have a dream ... which one? - A very nice accordion! - Right. - Gagarin, do you have a dream? I have it! Which one? So, share it with us. Talk to me, Dad. I want to go to the city, and enter the technical school. Take off. There they provide uniform, coat, shoes, a bed. What? They feed three times a day and they provide a scholarship. What do they supply? A scholarship, money. Seven rubles monthly. How good! When my father sent me to study, I had to pay for it. I should beat you up. A beating. That's right. But when was that, Dad? Long time ago. Listen, Yura. Come here. Life is ... like a carpenter. First cut you down with an ax. That hurts. Then it passes you the jack. It also hurts, but less. Then he scrapes you with the rasp. Then with a soft and smooth sandpaper, to that there are no knots or protrusions. Tell me, what is more beautiful? The column or the raw material? The column, of course. Yura, I can make millions of columns like that. But, the trunk has its character ... its unique streaks and divine grace. As if it were part of one, as they say. Why go to the city? For the city, then? Did you decide? I decided! Go! Presented the report last September ... I presented the report of the day and at night I was already flying. During flight, I see the polar twilight ... ... in autumn, in September, it's like a fire. Like an atomic fire ... Or like the wings of an angel. And I fly towards the fire ... Looked up... ... and I only see the darkness ... ...and the stars. Suddenly someone ... ... through that fire ... ...he told me... "You will be the first to get there. " I believed him right away. But was it not God who told you? Of course not. It was a voice. We are pilots. We believe in voices. Yes. We believe. Because we can't trust fully into the technology. And who can we trust? In himself. German, what if we really hear those voices there? For thousands of years, people watched the sky. And they dreamed of arriving to the stars. Watch, Yura. At first sight it seems chaos .... Precisely in this chaos ... ... is the key of harmony. Somewhere in there is the answer to the mystery of our existence. We are on the threshold of the universe... ... and we need to give, just one step. Mom, what are the stars? It's the light, son. Like that of a lamp or what? They are souls that shine. Souls? Yes, the souls of the righteous. Of the innocent children. Why are they so beautiful? People call them little tears of God ... Or the dew of God. If God existed, the Germans would not be here. You know, I read here who built a cabin ... ... that will allow travel from the earth to the moon. �Yes? Yes, they built it. It was not necessary, What fool would fly so far? I would only travel to an unconscious or a reckless one. Leave the family on earth and fly so far. Mom, they won't send a fool into space. There is advanced technology there, they just wouldn't trust her. And you, you won't fly, will you? Mom, you know, I'm a military man ... Where am I ordered, there I will go. What will become of Valya? Valya. What about Valya? She is the wife of a military man. The wife of a pilot. You know She is the wife he was looking for. She understands everything. Listen, we walked half a day through Moscow, Could we stop to smoke? I will also smoke with pleasure. Let's take a rest. Why don't you turn it on? What ...? Hi. Hi. Do you have chrysanthemums? Yes, of course. My wife loves them chrysanthemums. - Please. - Can you? - How much does it cost? - 60 kopecks, are you going to take it? They say the final group is already defined. Where do you get flowers like this? He will be the first ... You are double. And me, just the understudy. Grisha, you know that everything can change anytime. For the official decision, still a week away. Why are you nervous? Ten days to go ... And with us they play the cat and mouse game. They don't even trust us to steer the ship. They made up a code. What am I? � A qualified pilot or a monkey that presses buttons? A monkey will not be able to pass to manual piloting. But, you can. If one trusts you, you would pave the way to space since launch. And you, go to Kamanin and ask him to send into space instead of Gagarin. What is wrong with them? Where do you think they are? Calm down! Come on, separate! Boys, what's wrong with you? Better, let's buy flowers for our wives. Flowers? They love me without the flowers! I will go shopping. What's up, little one? Did you wake up? Valyusha, let me ... Hi. Let's go. Over here ... What is it? What eyes! What do you want to tell me? When Lenochka was born, you were afraid to hold it. I learn fast. We landed. It's for you, so that it does not extract me. What is it? Who will fly? I don't know. Maybe me, maybe someone else. When? Day 14. It's time. Please take care. Be careful. Valyushka, take care of the girls. Already. Yura, promise me everything will be fine. Ready. As I understand it, the final decision it was taken and there are no objections. The first to fly will be Gagarin. There are objections. Comrade Marshal, let me express my considerations on this matter. Yes, please. The point is that both candidates they are well prepared. Their biographies they are also almost impeccable. Why "almost"? They are both peasants. Yes, Gagarin is from Smolensk, son of peasants ... ... the mother is a milker in the koljoz. German is from Altai, his father he's a village teacher ... In fact, your child's name honors the Pushkin's hero in "The Lady of Spades". Yes, what a strange name. Yes, but Titov is stronger physically and it is more resistant. - Comrade Marshal, they have stung. - Let's go. What is the problem? We agreed. Sergey Pavlovich, I am agree with you that ... ... for a second flight, we will need a stronger ... ... cosmonaut and the most appropriate is German Titov. What worries me the most is stability psychological in adverse situations. Nikolay Petrovich ... We don't know how a man I will endure weightlessness. It is something that you know well. More than that, we cannot be 100% sure of success. Your hesitations about to leave they can only make matters worse. If you have specific objections, expose them. Okay, I'll be more specific. All exercises of training... ... Titov complies with more precision and no stupid questions. Sometimes Gagarin manifests you doubt its suitability. Be more specific. Specifically, ejection. And furthermore ... During a flyby, on a calculated landing ... Gagarin said: "The site is high risk." There were other facts. I get it. Regarding ejection, According to yes, he did it perfectly. As for your moment of doubt, it is precisely what I like about Gagarin. That means a balanced mind, if you want to know. Just born Gagarin's second son. He is sober, a rational man. Moreover, Titov ... ... lost her son, a few days after birth. As per yes, He wanted to hide this fact. Fearing that this could influence in a decision against him. We need that, after the return, the cosmonaut, tell us the whole truth. The future will depend on that of the space program! During the war, Gagarin was in occupied territory. Do you know what? It's time to finish with Stalinist prejudices! Comrades, we are before a transcendent challenge. Why don't we calm down? What is the difference who will be the first? The main thing is that it is ours, a Soviet man. - Golden words. - So? Khrushchev liked it� Gagarin's photograph. Here, the genius of the Soviet man the conquest of space began. Beautiful words. That was our first victory, the Sputnik. Back then, the boys and I we received the lieutenant stars ... ... and we listen on the radio ... It was an indescribable feeling. Indescribable. And then we argue all afternoon, When will man fly? Do you see how the stars are? That man is you and exactly on you ... everything depends. Sergey Pavlovich ... ... I will do my best to the flight was successful. I will strive, as they taught me. Do you know what is written here? "People, remember me with a prayer. " It was written 600 years ago. Do you think someone will remember? of us in 600 years? It is important, Sergey Pavlovich? Yura, do you think? In what, Sergey Pavlovich? There is no guarantee that technology work at all stages. Of course we will put you in orbit. But... ... on landing may arise unexpected situations. I get it. The brake mechanism, maybe I can't stop ... ... a device that flies at 8 km / second. For that very reason. If the automatic system does not work, you will orient the ship by the sun ... ... and you go to manual piloting. The code is "125". Understood, Sergei Pavlovich. The pressure in compartment 1 and 2, in the manual system it is 150. How does the flight take place? Understood, Spring. The flight proceeds normally. I'm in a good mood. I continue with the flight. I find myself ... about the United States. Out the window I see the stars go by. The view is very pretty. I continue the flight in the shadow of the earth. Sergey Pavlovich ... The Ballastics communicated to us that the ship's orbit ... ... has strayed about 100 kilometers. What does that mean? It means if it doesn't work the brake mechanism ... ... the ship will continue in orbit .... ... and will slow down due to the atmosphere. In a calculated orbit, it is possible to descend in a week. In this case, the ship can only return in a couple of months. And the reserves of provisions and oxygen will only last ten days. Does Gagarin know about this? No do not know. - But, we can communicate you. - It is not necessary. There is no guarantee of an adequate answer. I need the parameters TDU pressure gauge. Here Alba-1, report on the parameters of the TDU pressure. Speak Moscow! Speak Moscow! All radio stations work of the Soviet Union. We transmit a statement from the TASS agency. �About the world's first flight from a human being to space!

Higher... It does not match, then they sent another. To get older, my son it must go a long way. I heard on the radio that he was "older". No. He is not my son. To the moon? Attention! abandoned the shadow of the earth. Like an illuminator, I can see the sunrise The object is spinning. The object works likewise in the sun. Now I see the earth. I am on the sea. The direction of movement over the sea can be determined. Spring, are you in touch? That's right, Sergey Pavlovich. Let them tell Cedro you should be prepared ... ... to move to the regime manual piloting ... ... if the TDU doesn't work in the next two minutes. Yes. Spring, Spring, here Alba-1. Cedar, permission is granted, if necessary, go to manual piloting. Have you understood? It is understood. I'm ready to switch to manual piloting. Sergey Pavlovich. Kamanin does not agree to inform you Yuriy about the orbit detour. What does he understand? of orbital mechanics? Gagarin knows very well manual piloting will do it well. The TDU has worked. Everything is normal. Cedar reported, that the TDU has worked. The automatic system worked! The next to fly into space, it will be us! The journalists! Why you? �Because we must be the first to see it all and tell it! �In the coming years We will go, the doctors! Okay. Come on Zoyka! Now recite my poem over space! At that time, under the gloom of the pines ... ... green refreshing air. We were thinking of a blue rocket ... And we dreamed of flying to the stars! Sergey Pavlovich, there is no separation. The brakes work, 132 meters per second. But maybe it's not enough for the separation of the ship. I know that might not be enough. Why does he say that everything is normal? � means that everything It must be normal! In any case, we have a reservation variant. The booster system will burn out. during entry into the atmosphere. You are enjoying it! I'm flying! Flight! I'm flying! Flight! - He likes it, Mom! - Fly! Flight! There is no signal from the orbit. Then I entered the dense atmosphere layer. The signal was lost over the Mediterranean sea. Despite the deviation from the course ... ... our territory, according to the trajectory of the ship ... ...we have a reservation.... ... of 8,000 km. territorial of the USSR. Keep in touch with all the PVO points ... ... according to the trajectory scroll. Sergey Pavlovich, the first secretary is on the line. Tell him that we will inform you in five minutes. Yes.

Do not touch the cosmonaut with the hands! Yes, yes, yes, not hugging or kissing! It's an order! Or they will respond with their heads! Celebrate the pilot! GLORIA AL H�ROE COSMONAUT GAGARIN Gagarin's space flight divided his life into two parts. Before the flight - The search for your dream and its fulfillment, a dream of freedom. After the flight - The pressure of circumstances, the selfish admiration of millions and the impossibility of belonging to himself. Yuriy Gagarin reached the rank of Colonel in the Air Force, was appointed deputy director of the Cosmonaut Training Center. He died in 1968, while carrying out an experimental flight, on board a MiG-15UTI. Until the end of his days, he dreamed of making a second flight into space, but the Party and the Government of the USSR with different pretexts postponed that flight, fearing that he would lose a living symbol of socialism. , the cosmonaut N�1, of which the entire world was proud. ... be the first to do that that generations of people dreamed of. Be the first to dial man's path to space. Name me a mission more complicated ... ... than the one that touched me. That responsibility is not before one nor in front of dozens of people ... ... nor before the community. That responsibility is before all the Soviet people. Before all humanity, before his present and his future. I tell you, my dear friends, See you soon! As people always say goodbye, before leaving for a long journey. As I would like to hug you all, acquaintances and strangers ... To the far and the near. See you soon! Translated and synchronized by Kpucumo (PrimeWire linker)
