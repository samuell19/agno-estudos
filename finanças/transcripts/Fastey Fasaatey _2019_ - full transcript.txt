Mridula... Where's that pampered son of yours? He must be on his way. Today is such a big festival But he is still not home. Panditji is expected anytime soon. I fail to understand what has gone wrong with him! He wasn't like this before. Why are you so peeved? Your darling isn't even answering my calls. He must be busy. Mom, don't dare defend him. From the time he has moved to Noida... ...all he says is that I'm busy... As if we have nothing to do. He's young... he is handsome... He must be caught up somewhere! He has completely changed. He never paid any attention to my words... But now, he has started ignoring you too. No... Not at all. He isn't like that. He's very naive. He is innocent. Sometimes he acts as per his whims... ...but he's very good at heart. It was getting difficult to commute daily so far away to office... For how long would he have managed this way? So, he moved closer to his office. I often worry about him. Imagine how hard it must be for him to do everything by himself? Sir, Panditji has come... Please come, Panditji... Welcome, Panditji... Please come... God bless you... God bless you. Hope all well? Yes Panditji... with your blessings... ...everything is well. And Panditji, as you had foretold... ...our property matter got resolved exactly that way. Very good. Welcome, Panditji... May God bless you with a son. May you live long! This way Panditji.. I don't see Aakash. He should be here any moment. Panditji, I don't understand what's gone wrong with him! He is never home. Even on this auspicious day of Diwali (The Festival of Lights).... ...he is missing. Let me try and call him again. Mayankji, would you please? I think he should be close by. Brij Mohan. - Yes. Get him married at the earliest. Then all the problems will be solved.. What exactly do you mean, Panditji? Nothing that serious. We will talk about this tomorrow in detail. Let's not miss the auspicious moment.. ..to worship Goddess Lakshmi. It always brims my heart with happiness to see both of you here... Must have been busy with something really important. Possibly... Happy Diwali - To you too. Where were you celebrating Diwali? And why are you so late? We were just about to leave. Sister, please don't ask... I was so neck deep in work that I can't explain... Who works today? Clients from London do not understand our Festivals. Right, brother-in-law? - But, of course. It takes time to satisfy clients! Happy Diwali. - You said it... Brother in law... It's too late now. Let's all go inside. Happy Diwali Jugnu and Chanchal. - Happy Diwali to you too. Aakash. Why don't you answer my calls? Sorry, dad. Actually, I was really caught in work. Brother, can I ask you something? Shoot! Please keep a distance from these Overseas clients. They even make you work late nights. Try to understand, Jugnu. Output doubles at night. Output... interesting... Hey Dev bugger, you'll live long. Why? I was looking at your photo while taking a dump... ..and you just dropped. Yuck. Not yuck. Shit.. Your sense of humour is very shitty. Anyways... tell me, did you celebrate the festival... ...by hugging your special London client? Bro... It's courtesy to meet and hug each other on festivals. Dude, you're lucky. I can't even woo an Indian girl here in London. But you've got a London based girlfriend in India. My poor orphan friend... So you have started this nonsense again? I've told you so many times not to remind me about this. Alright. Tell me, my Bull... how did it go last night with her? Don't ask me, bro. It could have been a disaster... ...I mean... my family could have taken me to task. Thankfully, I woke up on time... ... else I'd be in a terrible mess. Bugger, one day this is bound to happen... ...and then Anisha will also not spare you. Shit. What happened? Did you poop? No... it stopped midway. Yuck. Yes Panditji, you were telling us about Aakash's marriage! Yes... Look Brij Mohan, as per his horoscope, his stars are well aligned. And the next two months are a good period. Okay. - Bless me, Panditji. God bless you... God bless you. Where are you going so early? Mom, it's very urgent. I'm already late. At least have your breakfast. - Bye Dad... Bye mom... This boy is too much. But there's one thing! What's that Panditji? No... Nothing to worry. It's just that his marriage is very important.. ..for the peace and harmony of this house. Panditji, I am unable to understand. Please elaborate. I need to leave now as I've some work. We will talk about this tomorrow. As you say. - Come Panditji. Brij Mohan, I was saying - Yes. Come. Anisha. Baby, I am sorry. Stop babying me. Anisha, I know you're upset. Look at me. I'm indeed very sorry. Sorry? Yes, I am sorry. Sorry my foot. What do you think of me? Your toy? Some keep? With who you can toy with and make love as you fancy. And you walked out on me... ...in the middle of the night? Where were you? Where were you? - Well, Anisha. I can explain that. I am sure you can explain. Listen. I get it. I get it that we are in an open relationship. But what about some courtesy? Some manners? You dolt. Anisha, I said I am sorry. Let's not get personal here. Wo..wow! You know what? It is personal. It is very personal because you had come to me. Not me. I've no home, no family. Can I please move-in with you? Bloody hell. Yes, I had come to you. Because I really like you. It's not just me. It's both of us. I had to leave early that day because.. ..something important came up. And you were sleeping. I didn't feel like disturbing you. That's it. I know dear; I made a mistake. I am sorry. Rubbish. Come on. Let me make it up to you. Go away. I won't go even if you are rude to me. Bitch. - Bitch? Let me show you; what this bitch does. What are you doing? Punishing you. And it's necessary. - No. Look... Please... It will come out. - What? Yuck! How gross! Ugh. What happened, Mom? Is everything alright? Okay, Mom. I will come tomorrow. Okay, Mom. I am coming now. Bed tea? I'm impressed. This is for you. Thank you. - And this is for me. Twinings! My favourite. Mister, what are your intentions? Tell me. What else do you want? Your Majesty... ...you have been very kind and have asked nothing in return. Now, I desire your permission. What if I don't allow? I will remain at your mercy. Something urgent has come up. And I need to go. Fine. Are you joining us tonight? Can't say for sure. But... I will try my best. Leave me be! What! You want me to get married in a couple of months? You can't be serious. We are more than serious. This can't be... Mom Son... Panditji said that if you don't marry.. ..in next two months then you never will. Panditji?! Mom. In which era you guys are living? This is 21st century. Aakash. I won't hear a word against Panditji. None of his words have ever gone wrong. But Papa, this... This is about marriage. And it's a question of my entire life. Yes. And we are very much concerned about you. That's why we called you immediately. But... I am not mentally prepared. Then get prepared. This is not fair, you know. It is like blackmail. Think what you want! And this is not just about you... ..but it's about everyone's life in this house. But, Dad. I need time and space to understand someone. I can't just marry anyone and start having kids. All you care is about everyone's life but mine. That's not true Aakash. All I know is... ...that if a married bride... ...does not make it to this house in time... ..then anyone.. ..in this house can die. What are you saying? The fact which Panditji told me. It is about the Planetary positions. Book my ticket to my native place. Just shut up. O God! Son. We've never forced anything on you till date. If you already have a girl in your life then let us know. We will talk to her parents for your marriage. Yes... Brother. Sir. Well... Could either of us also die? Yes. Moron, why are you calling me at this hour? Where's Anisha? In a party. And you? At home. Why? Did you both breakup? No... Then? It's mess. And I am unable to understand what to do now! Is she pregnant? No, duffer. Please, this is not the time to joke. Then tell me; what happened? Mom and Dad have suddenly fixed a deadline for my marriage. It's something to do with my horoscope. Then get married. You will have a good time... ...enjoy with one at home and with the other outdoors. Life will be more thrilling. Dev, can you never be serious? Here I am in deep shit and you are having fun at my expense. Okay, tell me your problem. There are many problems. Listen. First of all, I am not ready. Even if I convince myself... ..how can I marry a stranger? Why? Have you fallen for her? Buddy, I don't know. Really I don't know. But when Anisha is far away from me, I really miss her a lot. And when she is near... ...I desire to get even more closer to her. Be precise; how much closer you want her to be... my lover boy. Will you now get inside her? Anyway, you've solved everything. No buddy. There is another problem. Anisha is a very modern and free spirited girl. And you know my family. They all are very traditional. Especially, my Mom. I don't think that it will work out. Now listen to me seriously. When a boy and a girl love each other truly... ...the family then finally accepts them. And this is the question of your life. So do whatever you feel is right. And if you want an answer then listen to your heart. Okay? You take care. I will talk to you later. Is it some special day today? Fancy dinner. You're looking so hot. Hope you are not going to propose? No. Not really. But if you say, maybe... - Please... Don't even think about it. I mean everything is going well between us. Let's not complicate things. Anisha, why do you fear commitment? I have my fears. And I've my own reasons. Are you not afraid? See, Aakash. I really like you. But let's just enjoy till it lasts. I don't want to stay here. I want to see the world. I want to fly. Travel. Be free. And this is the age, to live life and enjoy. I understand. Cheer up, Aakash. You should be happy... ..for having a fun loving and sexy girl with you. That too without any compulsions. You should be on the top of the world. Yes, I am flying high. Oh. Hi, dad. What's up?! Anni, my baby. I miss you. I miss you too, Dad. Dad, why don't you come here for a few days? No pot holes and dusty roads for me baby. But when are you coming back? I really miss you. You know, dude? Christmas, Dad. I can't wait. Dad, say hi to my friend Aakash. Say hello. Hello, uncle. Hello, young man. You can call me Maddy. Maddy Sir. So Aakash, what do you do? Sir, I work with BL bank. NRI cell As AVP marketing. That's really cool. And where do you stay? Dad, actually he stays with me. He doesn't have a family. You mean... He is an orphan? Yeah. I am sorry to hear that. God bless you, my child. It's okay, uncle. So, Dad. What shall I get you from India? Just bring yourself, my love. I really miss you a lot. Bye, Dad. Bye, my dear. That was Dad. Oh... Cheers. Yes. Cheers. Aakash, stop it. I understand. I hope you didn't feel bad about today. No. Not at all. I've to resume office from tomorrow. So I was thinking about that. It's all, cool baby. Chill. Come here. Sister, do whatever you can... ...but please save me from this marriage. The stress is killing me. Just a second. Hold on please. You are back again. Step backwards, right now. Sir, he is waiting for you since long. Who? Tell him I am talking to a client. Okay. - It will take some time. And listen, don't come in again. Yes, sister. There's nothing for you to worry. You are of a marriageable age now. If you like any girl, tell me. Fine... ...take 2-3 days to think. Everything will be fine. How will a couple of days help? I thought I had 2 years. 2 years! Here take this. You talk to her. But Sir, I am already married. Sir, Ajit Sir has called you. Immediate. Urgently. That's what he told me. Talk to your sister later. Did he say this too? No. This I am telling you. I will talk to you later. Boss has called me. - Okay. Come. Okay, so you're a secretary in Ministry of Finance? Yes. Very good. Hello, Sir. Singhal. Yes, Sir. You didn't tell me that you're getting married. Sir, well... Come on, Mr. Aakash Singhal. Cheer up. Marriage will work wonders for you. Yes. Meet Mr. Prem Prakash Agarwal. He has come with a proposal for you. Come on, sit. You guys, please carry on. I will just come. First, the pressure of getting married... ...then girls' pictures on my WhatsApp. And now people are directly coming to see me in my office. What the heck is going on? I've become a laughing stock in my office. And it's not funny. Who gave the address? Son, well... Mom, you?! Son, please, cool down. It was just a slip of tongue. Slip of tongue? - I am sorry. I am really sorry. Mom, I'm already tensed. I'm having a nervous breakdown. And you are saying it was just a slip of tongue? Son, we are also nervous. Absolutely. Brother, listen. We too are scared. Brother, if you want we can help you. We will post your matrimonial profile on match-making websites. You will get married soon. Right, Chanchal? - Very good idea. See, all of us are so nervous. You're not the only one whose life is in danger. We all are in danger. So Dad, please do something to save our lives. There must be a way. Talk to Panditji. He can suggest some prayer... rituals... You know, he can advise something to get past this. Son, we've already tried. Okay. Alright. What if we offer a bigger sum to Panditji... He will make everything alright. Rascal. How dare you utter something like this about Panditji? Mridula, what is wrong with him? - Don't stress yourself too much. Let me talk to him. Aakash, what's wrong with you? - Mom. I am sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I am sorry. Hey... Where are you going, Aakash? - Mom... To find a solution. I am trying my best to... ...make everything alright. I've only one request to all of you. Don't pressurize me more... ...I do not want to take any wrong step because of this. I will be back, madam. See... He left home in anger at this late hour. I am worried. That's right. No boyfriends? Sorry! Nothing. No friends either? I prefer being alone. Boring. Alright. I will take your leave. Bye. So you said you don't like it here in India. Then why are you here? I really don't know. But this is my UK-India's cultural exchange project. And anyways, now it's just a matter of few months. And then I am off to my London. I was always in the boarding school ever since my childhood. Rarely I would come home. But even in that period most of the time I used to be alone. When I came first time to India... ...I stayed with my colleague at her house. There were so many guests and relatives who would frequently visit them. Oh my God! It was so annoying. It was such annoying and such inquisitive people. God! Tell me one thing. Why do you all have such big families in India? I really don't know. What do you mean? I don't have a family. I am so sorry. It's okay. Hi. - Hello! Actually, I had to leave the place where I used to stay. So, I am homeless now. Hey... I've been trying to call you from quite some time. Your phone is out of coverage area... ...since yesterday. Where are you? Is everything okay? Yes, all good. I am out of city. - What? At least you must have informed me before leaving. I was worried. Anyways, my office has been relocated. So, I've to shift immediately. Okay. Are you sure everything is okay? You sound really low. Yes, I am fine. When will you be coming back? Listen, I've to leave now. Are you trying to avoid me? No. I've to leave. Love you. Love you, too. Anisha! Yeah. - You look lost. Is everything okay? Yeah. - Sure? Yeah. Thank you. Everything is fine. But we can't rent our house only for two months. Please see if you can manage. I am sorry. My dear, take the oblation before leaving. Daughter, You are looking very tensed. Yes, Panditji. I've been looking for a house in this area since morning. But due to some or the other reasons... ...no one is ready to rent the house. If you can please pray to your God to help me; I will be grateful. Dear, God listens to everyone. And when you've prayed to Him with such faith and devotion... ...He will definitely answer your prayers. By the way, do you want a house just for you? Well... No, her husband stays out of town. Hey... - Oh My God! Just a second. Easy... easy. - Thank God you're back. So much luggage? - Come on, help me pack all this. Are you going somewhere? - There's so much to do. Yes, I told you. Now, help me pack. You already have managed it all by yourself. But this chain... Because you were not around. But you're also coming along with me. Alright then. So, let's quickly pack up everything. Yes. So I've decided. I am ready to marry. Congratulations. - But there's a problem. Don't worry. She's a girl. Thank God. At least that is not the problem. But there is a problem. These days we both are living together in Noida. What? You mean that you are living in with a girl without marrying her? Since when is all this going on? Huh? For the past two months. Two months? Aren't you ashamed? So it means that the marriage is on. No, it is not. Why? What's the hitch now? Well... I... I've... I've told her that I'm an orphan. Sinner! You've declared us dead even though we are alive. Such a big lie? Just to stay with her? Son. This is not done. I didn't expect this from you. Please... please, Dad. I am already ashamed of myself. Ever since I've told this lie... ...I've been feeling guilty. Please. It's ok. Brother-in-law. We all make mistakes. Look, all of us have already forgiven you. Huh?! Don't worry. We are with you. But, brother-in-law. There's one more problem. Now what? Even if you solve all the problems... ...and help me and Anisha get married... ...she'll still not stay here. What! Look at him. He lived with a girl at some place without marrying her. He even declared us dead. And now staying in this house is troubling you? It's not like that, Mom. - Then what is it? This is the limit. After marriage, I might have... ...to be a live-in son-in-law and shift to London with her. What? There are lots of problems in your India. Bachelors and single women can't get a house on rent. If unmarried couple wish to live in together... ...then that's the biggest problem. Are you sleeping? I am talking to you. You know what? I had to lie to get us an accommodation. Wake up. We are here. Wake up. Aakash. Have we reached home? Anisha, where have you brought me? What... What are we doing here, baby? - It's our new home. With Panditji's recommendation... ...we have got the first floor with terrace. Isn't it beautiful? And listen. Now be the perfect husband. Okay? I've to go. Hey... where are you going? Hey... Come back. 'If unmarried couple wish to live in together...' '...then that's the biggest problem.' 'You know what?' 'I had to lie to get us an accommodation.' Who's this? Which idiot is calling so late at night? Hello. I'm ruined, Dev. I am in complete mess my friend. Couldn't God grant me one more day? What? I was about to tell my parents... ...everything about Anisha. But before that... When did this happen? Just a while ago. What do I say? Buddy, now I can't take this all alone. Please come soon. I can't handle it anymore. Don't worry. I am coming right away. I am taking the first flight and coming. You be strong. Be strong. See no one can change the destiny. This isn't anyone's destiny. But something untoward. Who died? Who died?! Means? I mean is it your mom or dad? Who has died? You load of shit, how dare you to think about my Mom or Dad's death? You idiot, are you in your senses? Sorry. Sorry. Isn't it like this? Like what? I mean... Dude, I thought Panditji's words... ...have come true before time. No, idiot. Something else happened. Anisha's office got relocated. So she rented a house in my absence... ...which turned out to be my own house. You please come fast. I cannot take it any longer. Please, dude. Please. You dumbo. You should have told this earlier. Needlessly, you made me cry in the middle of the night. Good evening, uncle. Good evening, aunty. Hello, my dear. Good evening, my dear. How are you? Tea is just served. Let's drink. Water. It's from the water purifier. It's safe. And I've washed the glass twice. Have this. Thank you. Welcome. No, uncle. I'm good. Are you on a diet? No. You please leave it. She will take whatever she wants. So, how was your day, dear? Well, it was very good. I initially struggled finding my new office. How was the day for both of you? For us, all the days are same. Sometimes we even do not know... ...whether it is Sunday or Monday. Yes. She has become old. Though I've retired, age has caught up with her. Keep your comments to yourself. He still calls me aloud for every little thing. Mridula. Mridula. Mridula. And he is telling, I am old. That is out of habit now. So I can't do anything about it! Look, who is calling? It's Aakash's. Hello, Aakash. Mom. How are you? I am good. So when are you coming home? In some time Mom... ...and with a friend. Mom you know what? He has cleared all my confusion. Huh? Now, I am seriously considering getting married. Really? Hmm. Wow! This girl is like a charm. She just stepped into our house... ...and we started getting good news. What's the matter, Mom? Have you won a lottery? No. We've rented the first floor of our house... ...to a girl on Panditji's recommendation. She's a very sweet girl. Is she very beautiful? Yes, she is. Then get me married to her. Excuse me. She's already married. Then find me a girl like her. No. She is too modern. A girl of her type will not be able to adjust in our house. Aakash? Aakash. Aakash. Hello, Aakash. Nothing, Mom. The signal is weak here. I will be reaching home with my friend in some time. See you then. Okay, come fast. We are waiting. Alright. Mom, get me married to her! What did Aakash say? He is ready for marriage now. Wow! Yes. Madam, I am going to the temple right away. Yes. - Okay. That's really a good news. - Absolutely. Thank you, dear. Why are you thanking me, aunty? It's just a coincidence. You may call it a coincidence but our destiny has changed since you arrived. What do you say, Mridula? - Correct. Tell us about your family Yes. My dad lives in London. And Mom? Well, she's no more. Oh. I am so sorry, dear. What does your father do? Oh, we own a pub there. Okay. - Yeah. And now tell me about him. Him? Who? Your husband. Oh him! Aakash! He will be here soon. You may please talk to him. Hello, Son. Mom. Mom. Mom. He's Aakash. Yes, Aakash. Aakash! Dad. He's Aakash. First I couldn't believe that we both friends... ...were heading at the same destination. - Yes. So I told Aakash. Let's go together and surprise everyone. See, everyone is actually surprised. Absolutely. Dad, actually... ...our friendship is very old. We did MBA together. Is it? For a moment I thought you both are school friends. No... Let's go inside and talk. Yes, let's go. - Okay. That's all right but you know what, Dad? Anisha happens to be this idiot's wife. I can see that this is just not about the names but... ...there are far too many coincidences in both yours lives... Just like you, even the canteen owner would get confused in our college... ...as to which Aakash's account is in credit and which Aakash's account is in debit. Anisha. Looking lovely as ever. Hey, Anisha. Aakash. Aakash. What do you do? Aakash, did you not tell him? No Aakash. We have just met today. Aakash. - Yes. Not you. I'm talking to him. Okay. Just one minute, Dad. Why are both of you standing here? Go and make tea for everybody. Wait a minute. Lemonade for me. Anisha. - Yes. Would you like to have something? No, I am good. Thank you. Do you want something? No, we will have dinner now. Go, get a cup of tea and a glass of lemonade. And then prepare for the dinner. Sure, madam. Anisha. - Yes. Did you have your dinner? No. I was waiting for Aakash. Are you not feeling well? I was fine until now. Why don't both of you dine with us? Today I want to eat food made by Anisha. Right, Aakash? Yes, absolutely. I think it's a good idea. I'm sure she has cooked some Italian. Right? Anisha, what have you cooked today? Pasta. Italian. Anyways. Aunty. Uncle. Let me go upstairs and make dinner arrangements. Good night, dear. - Good night. Good night. Aakash. Come up once you finish your lemonade. Dad. Lemonade? Thank you. Chanchal. - Yes. The three of them will have dinner upstairs tonight. Go and help Anisha. - Okay. And make sure there's no trouble. Yes, don't worry. Come, Aakash. I will show you the house. Very good idea. Aakash. I am going to bed. Are you coming? Give me some time baby. Okay. Good night guys. Bye. That's all good. Now, tell me. Finally what have you thought? I want to marry. Just pray that the bride also agrees. She will. Otherwise, find someone else. Absolutely not. I only want to marry Anisha. Buddy. Just give it a thought... There are so many houses in Ghaziabad. But she had to only find this Singhal'shouse! When her destiny has brought her to this house... ...she is now not going away. What if she still leaves? Then... ...the death in this house will be mine. Awww. Don't get so emotional. Singhal. Will you die single? You idiot. Idiot. You're a gone case. It seems you're completely into love. I am. Pray that she also feels the same way for me. So be it. But do remember this one thing. The deeper you fall in love... ...the more you move beyond sex. Is it? Listen. At present you're active. Later all your activities will end. If you know what I mean. Think over it. Shameless. You will never change. My dear, you may call me shameless. But now I will also have to be shameless on your part. As you wish. Let me show you to your room down. But of course, after leaving me down, you will mount on top. Right? Pervert. Lock the door properly from inside. If anybody sees you in my room... ...we are finished. Bro, I've already had enough trouble during the day. Now please let me sleep peacefully. Come. Buddy I'm just warning you. If we are caught, we will be kicked in our butts. And even God will not be able to help us. Who is helping us in any case? Anyway. Go. Why haven't you gone to bed? Since evening you've been on your feet? Actually, your father had asked me to sleep... ...only after everyone had gone to bed. One never knows if anybody needs my help. So, will you now stay awake all night? That is not in my hands. It is all God's will. It's really useless talking to you. Now go. It's getting late. Okay. - Let me sleep. Good night brother. I'm too tired working. And you are sitting here like a king. It doesn't really make a difference to you, isn't it. I'm exhausted working throughout the day. What happened? I mean... - Look at this. Look at the condition of this room. Let me help you. I am peeved working the entire day. But who cares. Let me help you. - How will you help? Keep away. Help me! - Tell me what is bothering you? What happened? We are in a big trouble. Don't you know? Now, we have to work twice over... ...and that too in the same salary. Just move away. Chanchal, It's just a matter of two months. Two months? I can't do it. You can go ahead and take the burden. Now, move. I will try and do it tomorrow. Did you notice how this new Mr. Aakash was talking to us? As if he's the owner of this house. Even if he's not, consider him to be one. Why? Have you forgotten Panditji's words? Why, what did he say? If Anisha madam leaves this house... ...then the limited protection which we now have shall also go away... ...and our lives will again be at risk. And do you know that... The young and poor die first. And Chanchal. You're the youngest poor in the house. Oh God, please protect my Chanchal. Don't you scare me for no reason. No, I am not. Listen... - What are you doing? Let me sleep. I am just letting you know. - In this way? Move, let me sleep. Sleep quietly. Sleep. How can I sleep? Even in my dream, I am seeing God of Death. Was it a joke? No, listen. - What? Wish good night to God of Death on my behalf. You will get a sound beating. - No, listen to me. What! - Yes, tell me. Let's do it tonight. I'm scared out here and he's snoring unbothered. Aakash brother. Aakash brother. Black tea. Open the door. Your tea is getting cold. Brother Aakash. Brother. Brother, open the door. - Jugnoo. Why are you making noise in the morning? No, I am not. Brother is not opening the door. Come and help me. Brother. Brother. Where am I trapped, idiot? Move... you can't do this. - Brother. Let me try. - Okay. Brother. Brother. Open the door, brother. Brother. To hell with your brother. - Brother. Brother. Brother. - What's the matter, Jugnoo? Sir, Aakash brother isn't opening the door. Is it? - Yes. Aakash. Aakash. He never locks the door while sleeping. What's wrong with him today? Aakash, my son. Open the door. Wait, madam. I will check through the window outside. Hey Dev, it's me. Sir, Let me try once again. - Yes. Brother. - Idiot, where were you? I had told you... Come inside. Come inside. Wait. Open the window. Brother. What are you doing? Find another entry. Come here. Open the door. Brother, open the door. Be careful. Aakash, open the door. Wonder what... - Is something wrong? Come. Brother Aakash. Brother Aakash, open the door. What's the matter? Why are you all banging the door non-stop? Aakash, are you alright, son? Yes, mom. I had gone to the loo. I was struggling to relieve myself And when the motions started... ...I had to stop halfway and come open the door for you. Son, we were scared. Do you want herbal powder? You will get a clean bowel. Brother, drink this strong tea made by me. And see how quickly you poop. Take it. It's coming. Yes, it's coming. We were needlessly scared. Idiot, you were sleeping like a log. Are you here to help me or put me in trouble? What did I do? Now you are asking what you've done? We were about to get exposed while you were snoring recklessly. Is this why I have called you here? Bro, I couldn't get enough sleep. - Sleep... Moreover the jetlag. What are you talking about? How can anyone sleep blissfully... ...in such a situation? What a refreshing tea! Do you want it? Stop enjoying your tea. And pay attention to me. That clever Chanchal has seen me. Jugnoo. - Yes. Didn't I tell you last night? - What did you tell? That there's something fishy here. What happened? - You're not getting it. This new Aakash who is living upstairs was there in our brother's room. He hid himself as soon as he saw me. How's this possible? I personally gave tea to our Aakash brother... ...in the presence of Sir and Madam. You mean to say I am lying. No, I don't mean that. But... - Then what do you mean? But what? I've been noticing. Last night both of them came downstairs together. But our brother was pacing outside alone. And he was taken a back seeing me. And he shooed my away. Don't overthink. Get back to work. Do your work. Jugnoo, you're such a dumbass. I will have to figure this out by myself. Yes, so I am, Chanchal. Aakash. Aakash. Aakash. Aakash. Aakash. What happened, Anisha? Have you seen Aakash? My dear, ours is on the potty. I mean, he's in his room. And yours... - Yours must be with you. Right? - Yes. But he's not there. Did you check the loo? What? I mean... - Did you check upstairs everywhere? He's not a child. Where would have he gone so early? He's never up so early, even after the morning kiss! Keep looking there. Her Aakash will come out of this room only. Aakash. Aakash. Aakash. See what is happening. Even Mom and Dad are now looking for Aakash along with Anisha. It appears all of them are playing treasure hunt. Bro, now please do something and save the day. And how do you expect me to do that? You're Anisha's Aakash. You're your Mom and Dad's Aakash. Who are they looking for? You. And you want me to do something! My foot. - Alright. I get it. You just sleep tight. Okay? I will manage... ...my dad, my mom and my love. Let me manage everything. Satisfied? You're... you're no one to me, you bugger... No one to me? At last your true colours are out! Idiot. This poor girl is all tensed. Go and find her Aakash. Sir, I had peeped through the outside window. Her Aakash was in this room. Thank God, he's okay. If he's also there inside, why didn't Aakash tell us? Let me figure this out. - What must be they doing inside? Oh God! What must be they doing? Have patience, Mridula. Aunty, is there any problem? No. No, dear. No problem. He isn't opening the door again. Aakash. Perhaps after having tea he's sitting on the potty again. Why either of them is not opening the door? It can't be that both of them are on the potty together. What's all this? Tea. Potty. Potty. Tea. What's happening? Where's Aakash? Anisha. There's some mix up. We will soon find out. Just relax. Listen, without having tea, he felt pressure of loo.. ..so what is he still doing on the potty? O God! Potty! Good morning. There he is. Look. Your Aakash is here. Come with me. Come... - Hey... but... Hey... And she was telling that he's inside. But, Madam, I had seen him inside there. It is all clear now. Sorry? I mean when we went for the morning walk... ...it was all clear. Crystal clear. Aakash! What is the problem now? Now... Now, nothing. We were looking for the other Aakash and have found him. Son, you are naked. What do you expect me to do, Mom? All of you are repeatedly disturbing me. What do you mean? Please do one thing. Take me to your room. And when I get married... ...let my wife also stay there with you. No, listen. If you people are still not satisfied... ...you can put both of us in... ...the same cradle and rock it to your heart's content. Listen. Now this door is open. Anyone can come inside and go outside as per their liking. Most welcome. Sorry son. This Chanchal has lost her mind. She embarrassed us in front of Aakash. I am sorry, Sir. She always does this. Jugnoo. Everyone is angry with me. He was downstairs and then went up. What's going on? Something is amiss. Oh. Thank God. By the way, you guys should have... ...taken me along for the morning walk. It would have been such a good change. Exactly. But Aakash said, don't disturb the poor girl. Why? He said that both of you get enough exercise at night. So it doesn't make sense taking you for the morning walk. He told you that? Do you both discuss everything? Of course. We are best buddies. By the way, these days he talks a lot about you. Anisha is this. Anisha is that. Really? I even don't understand how anybody... ...can talk about one person all the times? How? I just don't understand. Okay, it's quite late. Let me go and see where Aakash is? Idiot. Now, tell me about which exercise... ...you were discussing with Anisha? The same that you do day in and day out... ...back and forth, up and down... ...at any time of the day... I was just talking about that. You idiot. Stop. Stop. - What are you doing? Stop. Where are you running away? - Take care of your towel. Stop. Stop. Ah. So many times I've told you... ...that you should not talk in this way to your best friend's girlfriend. What is happening to today's generation? Have the number of girls gone down? I was just trying to set up your marriage. Really? Jugnoo. I... ...always doubted both of them. What happened now? Ask me, what has not happened? Both these men... ...are love wrestling inside. What rubbish? Rubbish! Our brother Aakash was fondling the other Aakash. Then brother got nude and pushed him on the bed... Yuck... It's so shameless even I can't talk about it. I just can't tell. Brother Aakash. Chanchal... ...have you gone mad? I'm mad? - Have you lost it? Listen, Chanchal. Please don't discuss anything about this with Sir and Madam. Please. Let me explain it to you in the language you understand. If you talk about this, you will be fired. Oh really? So let them fire me. Will that bar these two men from making love? What nonsense are you blabbering? Chop these tomatoes first. You're not getting it. - I'm getting it. Enough is enough. Anisha Madam. May I ask you something? Yes. Does your Aakash really love you? What kind of a question is this? Of course he loves me. I mean, he cares a lot about me. Really? Then... ...was he with you last night? How does that concern you? No, I just asked. Because he was missing in the morning. Oh. Both the friends had gone for a morning walk. For a walk? - Yes. They are fooling her as well. So Madam, where's he now? Anisha. Quickly make coffee. I will just come. Yes. This was our Aakash brother calling. Now what is brewing between these two? Feeling better? Why did you need to go alone for walk? I could have got you to exercise here. Now Aakash is also important for me. How can I ignore him? So, I exercised a bit with him. And now I will exercise a bit with you. Very funny. Oh... our brother is a Player. He is taking turns on both husband and wife. If you exercise so much, you will tire yourself. Let's do one thing. Tomorrow, let all three of us exercise together. Disgusting. Hey God! This generation! Not just the boys, even the girls have lost character. Yuck. Why are you looking at me this way? You are looking quite fresh after bath. I feel like eating you. It's not that easy. You'll have to get your hands dirty for that. So, I will also take a bath. And then we will both get dirty. See you. Aakash. Aakash. Son. Aakash, are you in the bathroom? Son. Okay, tell me what you will have for breakfast? Son, at least give me a reply. Are you upset with me? Okay. We made a mistake. Henceforth we will not disturb you. Please say something. Aakash. Son. Ugh. So many times I've told you not to eat junk food. Now, come soon for breakfast. We are waiting. Aakash. Yes. This bathroom is totally dry. Where did you shower? Is she a girl or a detective? You're looking very gorgeous today. I am thinking of having a shower with you again. Anisha, I've an urgent office work. See you in the evening. Have the breakfast before leaving. No time, Anisha. Don't worry. I will eat in the office. Bye, baby. Bye. Hey... What's the matter, mom? You look puzzled. Aakash, there is someone in your bathroom. Yes Mom... Aakash is there. Why? Mom. Well, Anisha is using the bathroom upstairs. So, I told Aakash to use my bathroom. Your friend is quite strange. I was constantly talking to him... ...but he didn't utter a word. He's like that, Mom. Once he enters the bathroom, he doesn't talk. He talks only after he comes out. What? What? Why are you giving me that look? Nothing, brother. What do you mean by nothing? You're always hovering around me wherever I go. But, brother... - But What? No, ifs and buts. Your wings need to be clipped off. What's the matter, Aakash? What should I tell you? I find her always around me. I am getting late. Bye, everybody. - Yes, let's go. At least have your breakfast before leaving. We will have it in the office. - These boys are too much! You idiot, why are you silent now? Alright. Be quiet if you want. But understand what I am saying. I've come here to help you. Hope I won't become a sacrificial lamb. With great difficulty I have passed the last night. I won't be able to repeat that performance again. Are you taking me on a city tour? Will you please tell me where are we going? Huh?! Mridula. - Hmm... We've to shortlist the proposals we have received. Oh yes. And then we've to contact them too. Thank you. Madam. - Thank you, dear. Thank you. Hi, aunty. Hi, uncle. Hi, dear. Going to office? Yes, aunty. Chanchal, bring juice for Anisha too. No, I am good. Dear, sit. Your Aakash took bath downstairs... ...and left without having his breakfast. Yes, aunty. He will have it in his office. You should eat with us downstairs. It is not required for you to prepare it for yourself. - Yes. Absolutely. And yes, Anisha. Yesterday you had sent the pasta. It was very tasty. - Really? Thank you so much. And aunty, the food that you cooked yesterday. It was amazing. - Yes. You should have seen Aakash's expressions. He was licking his fingers. Try pasta. I always eat pasta. Let me eat the food cooked by Mom today. Mom? Mom. His Mom. She cooks delicious food. That's true. - Right, Aakash Homemade food is always the best. What should I serve you? Some more Pasta. Anisha, where did you learn to make such tasty pasta? From my Dad. I think I am getting late. Okay, aunty. Bye, uncle. Bye, aunty. - Bye, dear. Take care. Jugnoo. Thank you. Thank you. Madam, I've sent you a friend request on Facebook. Please accept it. Yeah, why not? Orange! Thank you. I've... - What are you upto with this facebook business? I've sent her a friend request. - Can't you see what's going on! You... I can see... - You eat this. Just to live in with a girl... ...you killed all of us? What if somebody had done this to me? How would you have felt? Huh! Trupti. Trupti. Please. He has accepted his mistake. Try to understand the situation. As soon as he got the first chance, he has come to you. Will you say something or only keep sulking? Sister... I really want to marry her. Please help. On one condition. You will tell her the complete truth. Because no relation can be based on lies. But, sister. I might lose her. That is your fate. Now yes or no? I need some time. Okay. Good. And you. You're Aakash's best friend, right? You flew from London to India. Couldn't you reason him even once? Sister, even I'm totally confused in this matter. I am feeling sick playing Aakash. Now I don't think I will able to carry on any longer. That's true. Dear, you should come and sit with us daily. We feel so relaxed. Hey, Trupti is here. Wow. - What a surprise! My daughter. Wow, very good. Welcome. - So nice to see you both. Mom. - Welcome, son-in-law. Hi, Trupti. It's so good to see you. Come. - Hi, Trupti. Anisha. So, you're that beautiful Anisha... ...who's the light of our house these days. I hope mom and dad are not troubling you much. Oh no. They are very nice people. She is just joking. Anisha, he's our son-in-law. Mayankji. - Hi. Good you came. Tomorrow, a girl's family is coming to see Aakash. What? When did girl's side start seeing boy's family? Times have changed. Anisha, are you both home tomorrow? Yeah. Then come join us and see our rituals. I will discuss with Aakash and let you know. Alright. What's the point in discussing with Aakash? The girl's family is coming to specifically see him. Actually her husband's name is also Aakash. Oh. That's really good. More the merrier. Why are you so late today? Anisha, I'm very tired. We will talk tomorrow. Why do you behave erratically? What do you mean? You look glum and lost. What's wrong? I'm like this only. How was your day? My day was amazing. Aakash's parents and sister. They are such nice people. I know. You know! Till date I didn't realize what I was missing? Are you listening? You know what... Tomorrow a girl's family is coming to see Aakash. It's going to be so much fun. I am so excited. Brij Mohan. - Yes. It's is getting late. Where's Aakash? He is coming, Panditji. Jugnoo. Actually, he is nervous. It is for the first time someone has come to see him. Brother Aakash. He is coming, Madam. Look. There he is. Panditji. Which is the groom? - On my right. The one on the right. Hello, Panditji. Mr. Brijmohan. - Yes. Is she your youngest daughter? She is looking very sweet. No, he has only one daughter. This girl is here just for a while. I see. - Is she a guest? Not now. You can consider her as our daughter. Yes. She's like our daughter... Ever since she stepped in this house... ...she has brought us happiness. What's your name, dear? Anisha. - Anisha. Are you married, Anisha? - Well... Yes, she is... But are you here to see the boy or the girl? What do you do, my son? Sir, I'm AVP in BL Bank. I manage the investments of NRI clients. And what about you, son? Aunty, he's the Vice President in the Barclays Bank. Yes, aunty. I'm thinking of shifting to London. There's too much pressure and tension in India. I presume you will go to London after marriage. Of course, aunty. Are you also planning to shift to London? It's not so easy to relocate. I mean, all these things take time. Right? - Yes. And it also depends on wife's choice. Right, Anisha? - Right. Have they come to see you or him? It doesn't make a difference. We both are bachelors. Uncle, why don't you take some refreshments? Please. - No. Trupti, please serve them. These samosas. Finally. Spared. - Jeez. I thought today we were gone. Boss? Sir, you?! Oh, hi Aakash. How are you? Hello, Sir. I'm well. How about you? Good. I was just passing by... So, I thought of meeting you. Sir you're welcome anytime. Aakash. Meet my beautiful niece. Risha. Hi, Risha. - Hi. Sir, meet my best friend Aakash. Dev. Aakash Dev?! Interesting name! Hi, I'm Risha. Beautiful name. Thank you. Are we going to just stand here... ...or will you introduce us to your family? Of course, Sir. Please come. Come. Hello, Sir. Hello, Mr. Singhal. Please have a seat. Hello, Dear. Please be seated. Your house is really beautiful. Thank you. We just hope to get a modest daughter-in-law now... ...to add sparkle to the beauty of this house. - Absolutely. Aakash... what happened to that proposal you got in the office? It wasn't that interesting. So it ended right there. Oh... I see. If you know of a good proposal, please suggest. How long can anyone live life alone like this? Certainly Mr. Aakash Dev. What happened? Are you alright? Aakash is okay. Aakash is okay. Okay, sir. How about settling down in London with a life partner? You know? Clean air, parks, pubs... Comfortable life. All in all a great city for the young to be in. You know. Well, if you say so young man. We are only concerned about the business. We will add your name in the list of overseas clients. Right, Mr. Aakash? Correct, Sir. He is cut out for a foreign life. Aakash. Just ask Anisha about London. It's amazing. Risha. You will absolutely love London. Yes, I heard it's a lovely city. You won't be disappointed. Ladies and gentlemen. Please, excuse us. Risha, come. It's time to go. You just came... - Please have some tea. Some other time. Actually, we've to be somewhere. We'd be happy to have your company for some more time. Not possible today. But I promise, next time we will also have dinner here. Sure. And do bring Risha along. She's very sweet girl. - Sure. Mr. Ajit, it's so nice to meet you. Pleasure is all mine. Thank you, everyone. Aakash. No, please. Do remain seated. Aakash will walk me to the door. Sir... Oh... Have some tea at least. Give it to Mr. Aakash Dev. Keep visiting us, dear. Yes, sure, uncle. Yes. You're more than most welcome. Thank you. Bye. Bye. - Bye. Dear, wasn't Risha very sweet? Yes, aunty. She is so pretty. I think your Aakash also liked her a lot. Really? - Yes. May you be blessed with happiness. Mom, no need to be so happy. You can't trust Aakash. He might like a girl but marry someone else. No. She talks nonsense. Aakash will only marry a girl of his choice. Do you know... I already have a wedding gown for his bride. Mom?! Show it to me please. Do you wish to see? - Yes. Wow, aunty. This is so pretty. Did you like it? What did you wear in your marriage? Well... I didn't get a chance. But aunty, this... This nose-ring is so pretty. Would you like to try it on? No... no... I am fine. Come on, try it out. Oh come on. Mom, you tell her. It's between the two of you. I won't interfere. Mom. Anisha. Wear it. Aunty, how can I wear it? This is for your daughter-in-law. No, not for a daughter-in-law but for a daughter. Right, mom? - Absolutely. So, come on. Now, wear it quickly. Before mom's mind changes. Oh God! This girl is so incorrigible. Come on. - But... You should always listen to mother. Come on. Now, it is complete. She is an embodiment of Divine beauty. I told you, it will look good on you. You were worrying needlessly. See, it suits you so well. - Yes. Mridula. Where had you hidden this bride till now? She looks very pretty, doesn't she? - Very much. I will go and change. - Hey, no. First let Aakash see you in this bridal dress. Brother-in-law will... I mean... Her Aakash will go nuts. Aakash. You are looking very beautiful. Really? Just like a bride. Let's make our honeymoon here. Sorry, Anisha. I can't. Why? Anisha. That... What happened? I had lied to you. Regarding? I... ...am not an orphan. What? You're joking. This is my house. This is my family. And the other Aakash you met... ...is not Aakash but Dev, my friend from London. You lied to me all this while? Just because you wanted to sleep with me? How could you be so cheap and disgusting? I was wrong. I know. But I really love you. You love me? I want to marry you. Oh yeah? You want to marry me? Sure... you want to marry me? I can see. This bridal dress. Bangles. I look like a bride, right? And everyone gave me so much love and attention. It's nothing but a staged show. A trick to get married. Anisha, this isn't true. This is not true. You're getting it all wrong. Everything here is so wrong. You're wrong. You're a fraud. Whatever I told you just now... ...each and every word of it is true. Please trust me. Trust you? A boy who can become an orphan... ...just to be physical with a girl... ...he cannot be trusted at all. Anisha, please. Don't touch me. Stay away. Anisha, please try to understand. - I don't want to listen to you. I do not want to talk to you. Anisha, you're not understanding. Anisha, I... I want to spend my life with you. Anisha and her husband... ...aren't seen since morning. Chanchal, go and call them for tea. Sir, they are resting. Last night Anisha madam caught cold. Oh - Why didn't you tell me earlier? Go, get my medical box. Mom, Aakash will take care of Anisha. What's wrong with you? I'm only thinking for their good. Mom, Trupti is also down today. Trupti is down, Anisha has cold. And even Aakash is quiet. What is happening with everyone in this house today? Sir. Are you also unwell? - No Sir, I'm fit and fine. Sir, I was just thinking that... ...we should find a bride... ...like Anisha madam for our Aakash brother. Jugnoo, you've spoken what I also feel. Mayankji. When Anisha came to this house for the first time... ...we thought she's very modern. Since Panditji recommended her... ...we let her in this house for 2 months. But now she has won our hearts. And when she goes back to London... ...we will feel that we are parting away from our second daughter. Who is this gentleman? Uncle, you?! Please, come. He's Anisha's dad. - Oh, I see. Come, sir. So good to see you. Anisha. Chanchal, go and call Anisha. Yes, sir. Right away. Please be seated. Have some tea. Anisha. Anisha. Uncle, please be seated. Look, I've not come here for entertainment. I've come to get my child. You sound disappointed. Have we wronged you in any way? Are you guys for real? How innocently you are enquiring... ...if you've made a mistake? Do you think... ...I am an idiot? Stop pretending and ask your son. There are really good actors in India. Where's Dev? Call Dev. But there's no Dev in this house. Bloody liars, the lot of you. Dev. Dev. Look, I think there's some misunderstanding. There's no Dev in this house. There. There he is. Yes, come here. Come here right now. But he's Aakash. Your daughter's husband. What? Anisha's husband? - Yes. My daughter is not married. Are you guys smoking weed? What's happening? I'm unable to understand. Look, I don't have any time for this bullshit. I've just come here to get my daughter. Okay? Where's Anisha? Dad. Anisha! Anisha! Are you okay, my baby? - Yeah. Did these guys hurt you? No. How did you get here? Dev called me. Come on, baby. Let's go. Where? Ah... there you are. Come. Come. For the sake of everybody's clarity... ...can we have your name please? Mister. Dev. Dev Mathur. There. Bingo. Game over. Aakash. What's all this? Dad, I will tell you everything. Uncle, please come with me. Let's talk somewhere else. Oh, so you want to talk now. I don't want to talk to you. But while I am here... ...let everybody know that your son is a cheater... ...a liar and above all... ...an orphan. Orphan?! What is he saying? Aakash. Sir, please stop. Anisha, you know everything. Please, leave my family out of this. Aakash. Whatever you want to say, say it here in front of everybody. You've lied. Now, face it like a man. Dad, please. Please, let's go upstairs. Dad... Dad... Dad, please sit down. Be careful. - Get some water. Jugnoo. - Bring water for him. Water. Are you alright? Everything will be fine. Come on. I am all here. Speak up. We haven't got an eternity boy. Talk. Yes. It's true that I lied to Anisha in the beginning. I was physically attracted to her. I was wrong. But it's also true that now I have started liking her a lot. Sir. I really love your daughter. Love my foot, you lusty bastard... Dad. - Enough. Dev. Don't meddle in my family affairs. He's my family. You hit him. Fine. He deserved it. But no more. A relation is not a one sided thing. It takes two to tango. What do you mean? Nobody is perfect. Your daughter was willingly in this relationship. And I believe we all are adult here. Alright? Bollocks. Shut your nonsense. Shut up. You. Go, pack your bags. Where's your room? Move. I apologize to you on behalf of my son. And dear. To you, too. Sorry, dad. You had to face this embarrassment because of me. Son. It's not your mistake. We failed to raise you properly. Mom. Dad. Are you still angry with me? Will you not bless me? Earlier you used to scold me. Why are you quiet now? Son. Now, you've grown up. One can scold only till a certain age. Now, you will reap, what you sow. Go. You're getting late. Sir. Please, forgive brother Aakash, sir. Please, forgive him. Sir. Brother Aakash is very sorry. In the beginning, I also felt that something is wrong. Later I found out that it was to the contrary. I was needlessly doubting him. Sir, please forgive brother Aakash. We request you. Come in. Uncle had called me. I know. I don't see him. Some of your belongings came with me. He has gone to return them at your place... This... ...bridal dress and jewelry. This belongs to her now. Tell her that it is from her mother. When she gets married; tell her to wear it. She looks very pretty in this attire. Your mother's jewelry and wedding dress. That night you were looking very beautiful in that dress. You should have kept it with you. Your mother had kept it for her daughter-in-law. How could I take it with me? She would feel bad. My mother has a big heart. That... I know. Only there is some problem in you. Okay then, Anisha. I will see you later. - Aakash. You're such a big idiot. Did you just call me an idiot? And who are you? Princess of England? Just another headstrong girl! What do you mean by that? One who only does what she wants... ...and never cares about others. Selfish. You're a selfish brat. Ohh... So now you're throwing an attitude. But yesterday you were quiet in front of my dad. I was quiet. Because I was wrong. But you could have said something... ...after being punished. You could have stopped me. Oh brilliant! After what just happened... ...did you want me to hold your hand there. Why not? Yes, of course. And then I should have promised heavens... ...in front of everyone. And declared... Anisha, I love you! Exactly. And I should have then kissed you in front of everyone. I earnestly want to apologize for yesterday. The way things panned out; It should not have happened. But what I've really come here to say is that... ...even Anisha loves Aakash. So, please accept her as your daughter and... ...make her a part of this beautiful family. Sir, Panditji is here. Come. Come. Ouch. Aakash. Aakash. Impossible. What is impossible Panditji? I fail to understand why the girl's horoscope... ...is showing a time period of nine months? What does it mean, Panditji? I mean, as per her stars... ...she will deliver a child exactly... ...in nine months from now. So, there should be no delay in marriage. Let me call Aakash right away. What's the matter, Trupti? He isn't answering my call. Your son was responsible for a few days. Once again he has become his old self. Try to call up Dev. Uncle has agreed? And even Panditji has given okay? Sister, this is really a very good news. What? Don't you worry! Bye. He's going to get married. But he can't even wait until then. Anyway, even I can't wait any longer. But let's get him married first. Call the bride's brother. It's time to do the rituals. Hurry up. Call Dev. Dev. Dev. Both of them were here a while ago. Yes. I am trying his number. Wait a minute. Yes. Dev. It's ringing It's ringing
