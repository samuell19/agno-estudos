Hey, how are you? Good. Quite a lot of people here today. Yes, it's not bad. It can still be better, but well... So, I’m going to the water. It’s warm. Is it good the water? Warm like a soup! Are you not coming? Later. Still digesting lunch? I’m not a great swimmer. Sometimes I come here and not even go into water. - Oh, really? Just sitting here also pleases me. Would it bother you if I sit with you? Not at all. Are you not afraid of catfishes? The ones with 10 meters? 5 meters would be enough. That's all a bunch of crap. You ever seen one? No, but it's obvious that there's some in the lake. They are everywhere. I believe that there is a catfish in the water, even several. But one with 5 meters, that must be a joke. But you know, the ones with 4 meters are not that rare. Oh yes! I have already seen catfishes that big. And from 4 to 5 meters is not that far. As for me, I would not like to meet with one. Me neither. But a catfish with 5 meters, that must be a joke. I come here every year. I would have seen one. Maybe you weren't in the same place at the same time. You come here often? - You also wanna know if I still live with my parents? No, it's just that I've never seen you around. You come here often? - Yes. But today is the first time in this Summer. You new in the area? With my girlfriend we used to go to the other side, with the families. I see. - We broke up in Spring. And since then I come here. I like the quietness. It's quiet, there's no one. And I'm not saying this so you leave. Really. I enjoy talking to you. And what do you do? Not too much right now. And before? I used to sell fruits and vegetables in the market. And now... - I'm trying to figure out what else I can do. But I still don't know. What about you, what do you do? That's not important. I just told you what I do, you could do the same. I'm a lumberjack. Great. That's not that much. Yeah but it's really cool. You work outdoors, in the forest. You should see it from the good side. Excuse me, but I have to go. Hey. - How are you? Great. Good Evening. Tell me something… Where are the girls? Girls? What do you mean? Some really sexy girls. Oh, I think you came to the wrong place. Oh no, there are girls here sometimes. I have never seen. That’s because you don’t come here that often. Good luck. Long time no see. That's true. I don't see you anymore. I don't see you anymore. Don't you wanna to sit down a bit? - I have to say hello to someone first. I will be right back. - See you later. So, how was it yesterday? -What you mean? Found your man? Why are you saying that? You left so fast... I imagine that it wasn't only to say hello to him. Did you find him? No. That's bad. And the woods are not that vast... I mean I found him, but he wasn't alone. That even worse. Would it bother you if I take off my clothes? - No. But is it allowed? Well, actually is forbidden all over here. It's not really forbidden over there. It's not exactly allowed, either. Are you married? No. Do you have a girlfriend? No, I am gay. You sleep only with guys? Would you mind if we speak less formal? That would be rare. What? I know some guys who sleep with other guys, but they are with women. Gay guys, I mean really gays, I don't see that often. Have you already been to the woods back there? Not really, but I know Cap d'Agde, and other beaches... And you've never seen guys strictly gays? There was this guy, really nice and cute, and also really effeminate. Not like you. You I'd never say... You don't... You look like a guy. You look like a normal guy. And he slept only with other guys. I've never thought that a man could make love like that. Do you also sleep with guys? It happened, when I was with my ex-girlfriend. We had so much fun! In the weekend we used to go to the Cap and have sex with 3, 4, 10... That was great. Why did you break up? No idea. Maybe we had enough of all of that. Or enough of each other. Can you take care of my stuff? You know how to swim. Thanks. And you are not bad either. Not as good as you. You used to be a pro? Only as as kid. Can I sit here? - Yes, please. You come here often? Kind of. Funny that we have never seen each other. And you? Since I discovered the place, last month, I come regularly. So you new around here? What are you doing? I'm waiting you. I'm coming. Shit, it looks like they are serious together. He is never alone. Well, he is not the only guy in the world. But I really like him. I understand, he looks really good. Always the same story. I always like those who are not available. Well... I'm leaving. See you tomorrow? I'm not coming tomorrow. Then another time. Yeah, see you. Let's go a bit up there? Oh shit! Can you go do that somewhere else? I can't stay here? - No. That was ok, he was harmless. You don't mind people observing you? - I don't really care. And if that can make him happy... It bothers me. Doesn't seem to bother you that much. You have a nice dick. You're not gonna suck me without condom. Are you sick? No, but... -So what's the problem? You never know. I trust you. Do you trust everyone just like that? It's just a blowjob, what's the problem? I'd rather not. You got a rubber? You don't? I used all I had. I'm gonna cum. Kiss me. Stop! Let me go! I thought you were not coming today. Changed my mind. What's wrong? Not feeling good today. And you? I'm ok. What's your problem? Nothing important. I will be alright. Wanna talk about it? - No. Does it bother you if I stay here with you?? Did I give you the impression? No. - So? Why you ask? - No idea. Since you like to stay by yourself. I'm alone because no one comes. That's too easy to say. From there it seems you don't want to be bothered. If you want to meet people, well go and meet people. How's that? You go there and you talk to them. Oh, not my style. But that's why you are here, no? - No! But why you stay here, then? Why you don't go to the other side? Or to the other? Because I like it here, If I'd go to the other I wouldn't see anyone. On the other side if I start to talk to people there they'd think I'm crazy. That's the good thing about this place here, I can talk to everyone. But cruising, that's not for me. And what you do now that you are single? What you mean? Sex. I don't have it. Aren't you too young? -What you mean? Is there an age? - No idea. He is not coming today. Should we go have a drink? Not today. I would love to, but today I can't. Hi. Did you stay late yesterday? And what did you do? I went home. Hi. Hello. You come for a drink? Sure. Bye. Hello. Hello. Can we share the towel? You alone today? What you mean? Without your boyfriend. What boyfriend? The guy you are always with. Oh, that's not my boyfriend. - I thought he was. We met five days ago. - You look like a couple. And you, what did you do with yours? He is not really a boyfriend. He looked really into you the other day. We just see each other once in a while. Nothing serious. And if he sees us now? He won't see us. I like the way you kiss. I can do more that that. Kiss me, I'm coming. I have to go. Shouldn't I make you cum? See you, I hope. I'm gonna stay a bit longer. It's gonna be dark soon. What you gonna do here then? Don't you have time for a drink? - No. See you tomorrow? Is this your car? Yes, why? Just like that. It's been ages I saw a Renault 25. Yeah, they don't produce it anymore. I don't know why. Specially because it was a great car. Anyway, I'm really happy with mine. So, see you tomorrow. What's your name? Michel. And you? Frank. Hello there. Hey. -How are you? Keep walking! He is with me. He was just saying hi. - Yeah, I saw that! How should one do it then? I'm starting to get you, you want to get every guy here. Well, that's what this place is for. - Yeah, but not here. There you can flirt and look for guys, but not here. Where is the border? Next to the trees over there. Where do you know this guy from? What? - I don't know him... He did the same with me last week. He was alone, he came here just to tell me to stop staring at him. He told me he wasn't available. And that I shouldn't be either. Why he said you're not available? They see you talking with the same guy a couple of times and say he's your man. It wouldn't surprise me if now he thinks I' with you. How are you doing? Looking forward to getting back to work. At least it keeps my mind busy. There I'm always moving, doing stuff, don't have the time to think too much... Here all I do is thinking. If you are looking for the swimmer, I didn't see him today. He will come. Oh, so did it go well? You... I think I'm falling in love. That's great! That's why you look a bit sad? Well, I'm leaving. See you. Have fun. I missed you. Me too. Come. I want you to fuck me. It bothers you if we don't use a rubber? Carefully! Kiss me. Come here. Why you don't want to spend the evening with me? Because I have my things. Sex is great, but it doesn't mean we need to have dinner and sleep together. I would love to spend the whole evening with you. If we start like that in one week we will be bored. I don't think I could get bored so fast. What's going on? They found a body in the lake this morning. Where? Over there. I think you should start going somewhere else now. This gonna last the whole summer. Why do you think that? Would you want to swim where someone has died? Maybe not today, but in a few days. The catfishes should be enough. - There you go again with the catfishes. The fisherman, who told me about the drowned man, he mentioned catfishes. The body had any bite marks? No... I mean, I don't know. He hasn't seen the body. He was just trying to find an explanation. Anyways, catfishes don't attack humans. Not that I know. But that's not because we've never heard about it that it can't happen. Well, I think that's it here for today. Wanna have a drink? I will stay a bit longer. Should we have dinner together later? Will you be available? Of course. I call you, ok? Have you heard? - About the drowned man? Did you know him? I think I saw him. Oh, really? But I don't know where from. You looking for someone? - Yes. Watch out, the police is in the area. - Why? No idea. I didn't see them. Just heard about it. Maybe that's just crap. See you. Bye. - See you later. Detective Damroder. Good morning. Did you know the victim? - No. Have you seen the pictures on the newspaper? - Yes. I didn't. Check this one. It's more visible. Yes, I knew him. I saw him here around a couple of times. On this side? Was he gay? Yes, I think so. And you, did you know him? - No. But I don't come here that often. Last Tuesday in the afternoon? - I was here. And you? - Me too. Were you together? - No. And how long did you stay here? I normally stay until 6 pm. And last Tuesday? - Same thing. What about you? I stayed until late. It was already dark when I left. And what were you doing here until so late? I was in the woods. Did you have a view over the lake? - Sorry? Could you see the lake? No, I was in the woods. Yes, but you can see the lake there anyway. Not from where I was. Were you alone? No. - Excuse me, do we need an alibi? Not yet. I just want to know if you didn't see anything. - No. - And you? - Me neither. Ok. If you remember anything, you know where to find me. It wasn't an accident? We still don't know it. It wasn't a catfish, that's for sure. Why you said you didn't know him? Because that's true. You've never seen him? No. Liar! You met him last Sunday or Monday, we were talking and a guy came to get me. You don't remember? Oh, yes. - That was him. But it was really fast. He was wearing a cap... And you, why did you lie? I don't want people to know I come here to get guys. What you mean by 'here'? Or somewhere else. I want to be discreet. Cruising on a lake, you think that's discreet? Are you not sad that he's dead? No. I will not miss him. You staying here? I'm gonna say hello to him. I will be right back. I'm waiting... Everything fine? And your boyfriend? Just wanted to say hi. That's nice. Bad mood? What you mean? I have no idea, it looks like that. It has nothing to do with you. Feeling a bit depressed today. You wanna be by yourself? If I don't, would you stay? Don't be silly! I could stay for a while. We can talk if you want. I have time. Come on, go back to him. Wanna have dinner tonight? I invite you this time. You are not spending the evening together? No, it's not... Excuse me, may I ask you a few questions? To me? -Yeah, you. In private. Last Tuesday evening, may I ask who was with you? Someone who could confirm your story. Do you think it was a murder? - We still don't know. The vicitim was a good swimmer. So? I don't know his name. Not at all? You stay a couple of hours together and you don't know his name? Phone number? No, I'm sorry. But this is common here. And what do you do to see each other again? Maybe we won't. You are with someone, with whom you don't even see the time passing, wouldn't you want to see him again? It's a small world, I would say. You all know each other. Not everyone. And that's not all I do. You sure he was gay? We don't know nothing about him seeing women. Which doesn't mean too much. Even if, for a good-looking man like he was... I'm not gonna hold you longer. Did you meet him here? Cruising or swimming? Cruising while swimming. Not bad. And what was his problem? Don't you think the detective asked already enough questions? You don't tell him anyway. So you could tell me. Why should I answer you? Is this an interrogatory? If a guy I was seeing was found dead, this would be unexpected, and of course this would worry me. You think I'm not? I think you don't care. Maybe things weren't going well between you two. It's not that I don't care. Even more if he was killed. Do you think it could be that? How can I know? Since he was a good swimmer. Yes, he wasn't bad. But... good or bad. Bad luck comes to both. I'm going swim. Are you coming? We have the lake only for us. No.. A guy just died here. - Ah, come on... We are together here, what could happen? You go, I watch you from here. You don't need me to swim. Fair enough. I'm coming. - Me too. What's the problem? You eat alone, sleep alone. Why you don't come with me? I already told you. I don't want to get married. And also I'm good by myself. What's the point then? If each one goes different ways? And what about the pleasure of seeing each other again? If it's only for that, then I say it's stupid. I can't stand it too long. Did you tell the detective I was here when that guy was killed? No, I don't even know your name. Somebody said having seen my car on that evening. I don't know what's your car. The only thing I said was that I wasn't alone. - You didn't describe me? Vaguely. What's the matter? They know I was here. If it wasn't you, who could have told them I was here? No idea. You went towards the lake that evening? Did you see anything? - No. Shit. I come back later. I'm sorry about yesterday. Yes, you forgot about me. We didn't confirm we would have dinner together, did we? I thought so. I don't know if you have noticed, but I really enjoy to be with you. I'm really worried about this story with Michel. Be careful, there's more than sex in life. It's not only about sex with me. If we don't spend the night together... I know a bit about it. You know, not even two years ago, sex was the only kind of relation I wanted. For me friendship was pointless. Now, I really miss you when we don't see each other for two days. When I see you coming my heart starts to beat faster, like I'm in love. But I don't want to sleep with you. You also want to be with me. And it's not to fuck me, I imagine. To sleep alone, to eat alone, always being alone. It's difficult. And I wonder if you have to fuck someone to sleep with that person. If you want to sleep with someone that means you want more from that person. Yes, but something else than sex. Your man can also be really jealous. Maybe he realized what was going on. What? - He came to see me. He was asking if I was with you in the woods last Tuesday. He had a weird look in his eyes. Ok, he has a nice body, a nice skin, he looks hot... But don't fall in love with him. I swear to you something is wrong with him. And the detective was asking a lot of questions about you and him. I would be scared if I was you. And what did he ask you? What you are doing? I'm waiting for you. I'm here. Easy to be found. You don't want to be with me anymore? I just wonder for how long. And does it turn you off to know it's not gonna be forever? Why are you playing the jealous boyfriend now? You wanted your freedom, your space, and me when I talk to Henri, you get mad. I've been here for hours already. Why you got here so late? Would you like me to get here at the same time as you? Well, maybe if you were as in love as you say... I had some stuff to do. And like you were saying the other day, it's good to miss each other. I thought you liked that. Yes, but when I feel that you don't want to see me, then it bothers me. What you mean? I'm right here, no? Pascal seemed to always be there. I don't think you liked it. That was different. With him it was only about sex. And that's different with you. Maybe not for him. Maybe he wanted to have dinner with you, to spend the night with you... What do you mean? You are allowed to fall in love, but the others aren't? People can't always adapt to you. Would you mind to go jerk off somewhere else? I really can't stay here? We are not having sex. We are talking and we don't want you here. I'm not listening to anything. Even if you don't listen to us you can still hear something. Come back later, when we are having sex. Okay? Okay. Do you think I killed him? And why should I think that? Why you still talking about him, then? If I thought that it would be something really silly. Really silly indeed. May I sit here with you? Lost your husband? He didn't come today. I'm happy to finally being alone with you. I want you so bad. I know. No you don't. - Yes I do. What's your name? Eric, and you? Frank. Stop. I will be back soon. What a great dick. Ok, I have to go now. You getting used to stay here until late. Do you know that the victim was with your boyfriend? No. People here knew that. I don't come here that much. You seem to be here often. Since a couple of days... Since you know... - Yes. I mean, since the murder. Now you think it was him... I don't think anything... I observe, I listen... By the way, I found the man who was with you that evening. He said you were together before the evening. And? You said you both left in the evening, and not before. Yes, that's because I met someone else after he left. And why didn't you tell me that? Because I didn't want Michel to think I fuck with everyone. You know, we are still fresh together. - Yes, I understand. And from this unknown man, I imagine you don't have any information either. Don't you think strange, we found a body in the water a few days ago, and everyone is back, cruising. Like nothing had happened. We can't stop living. One of yours is killed, and that doesn't bother you? The poor man was three days in the water, his car was here. And no one noticed anything, not even his lover. We know that they weren't a couple. However, I think that sometimes you have a very strange kind of love. Can you imagine how lonely he was? I'm asking you neither for compassion nor for solidarity. But it could worry you at least a bit, even if only about yourself. It could be that there's a gay killer in the area. Do something, before something is done to you. You sure you don't have anything to tell me? Well, we will see that tomorrow at the police station. Good night. Michel? What are you doing here? I wanted to know what you do here when I'm not with you. And what you're going to tell the police now that you don't want to be with me. And where did you hear that? I think you still love me. It doesn't bother you to spend your days staring at the lake? It's the holidays. It can't kill you. But it must be horrible on a long-term. I just have three weeks in the Summer. And that goes so fast. What you really looking for? Do we have to look for something? Don't tell me you come here everyday, just like that. And if that's the case, what's the problem? Don't you think that people here wonder what you want here. Someone who is never naked, who is never cruising, who doesn't swim... Don't you think it's odd? - Is it? It is here. You mean it's odd and dangerous? I don't get it. You're saying people wonder whether I killed Pascal? No, I'm not talking about that. - But I am. You plan to drown him when you have enough? Why you say that? You are not very subtle... If I'm not how it comes the police has nothing against me? Don't worry, it's not gonna take too long. Ok, I'm gonna have a walk in the woods. Fuck! Just leave it. I had what I was after. The only thing I was afraid of was the pain. Henri? Frank? Come! Where are you Frank? I'm not gonna hurt you, Frank. Come on, Frank. Don't leave me, Frank. I need you! Come! Let's spend the night together. Michel? Subtitles: mortauxvaches
