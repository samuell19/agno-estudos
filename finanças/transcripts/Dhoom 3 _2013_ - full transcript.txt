Every story needs a beginning. The great epic Ramayana was started by the Sage Valmiki. When sage Sutha narrated a story to his disciples, the Mahabharatha began. This story began on a rainy evening on the terrace of Mr. Viswanath's house There is nothing more ill fortune than being father of a daughter. Everyone speaks about the mother who carries child for 9 months in her womb. No one speaks of a father who fulfills her needs from her birth to marriage Girls... cry when they are born. but make us cry when they Ieave after marriage. When a girl is born... you enjoy when she is playing in your lap. When she is 16 years and she is walking beside you and when guys stare at her... You feel proud to be the father of such a beauty. l wasn't happy when a son was born to me. But, before 19 years... on a night like this. When l was sitting in veranda of Mission Hospital l heard a cry. That cry changed my whole life... Anjali was born... l didn't know how time passed away... with her Farex box, school bag... When she was 8 years l bought her an ice cream. She asked ''Daddy, if l want an ice- cream everyday, how much must you earn?'' The next year l bought an ice-cream parlour beside her school. Then l decided... if she has to be free of difficulties... l had to earn money... and l earned millions. Every year l gift her on her birthday Even last year l gifted her... But l never expected that it would change our lives upside down. How is your gold coloured fish? - How d'you know l was near the aquarium? l know you from the day you were in your mother's womb Even Anju knows where her daddy is... - Where am l? ln Delhi. You are back to hotel from meeting and calling from your room... After the meeting, returned to Hyderabad by a flight... l'm standing just below the window of your room and speaking to you... Give her your blessings. What did you bless her? - She should be married soon. Bless her to clear her exams, marriage can be done in four hours Even exams are the same its get over in three hours Well, where were you last night, when we had been to your room to wish? You were with him! What you would've Iost if you had informed us the same. Then what would you do? Could have been part of your happiness. Nothing else! Only wishes.....no gifts for her? - Are we given any chance for it? Last year l thought of gifting her cycle, daddy gifted her Scooty This year l thought of gifting an helmet, but he gifted her a car How about next year? No matter what l shouldn't be sentimental about such things. You can challenge me in all matters except Anjali's Because no one can love her like how l do Why not? My son is there - Your son is superb in all matters l've already paid you for the month - l expected a raise in next salary ls he there? - Is it madam What is it? - Tell him to send Rs.1000 with you.
