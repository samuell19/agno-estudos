MAN OF DESIRE "BE MEN OF DESIRE" - PROPHET DANIEL Where are you coming from? Do your eyes hurt? No. I was in Deauville. I spent all my money playing roulette. Do you have a cigarette? Sorry, I don't smoke. So you pick up anybody you find on the side of the road? I always stop out of curiosity. I have no merit, you know. Why are you looking at me like that? You look sad. Are you suffering? Your life must be boring. You ask too many questions. You can drop me here. This is where I'm heading. Stop the car. I would like to see you again. If you need anything, give me a call. I'll give you my card. Here. Listen. - Do you need money? - No. - Goodbye. Call me. - Goodbye. MAIN BATH HOUSE I wonder how is your wife. Or your house. Is that why you called me? I called you in order to see you again. There's something I don't get about you. Last time I was intrusive and now it's your turn. But it's OK. What don't you get about me? Basically, for what purpose did you come? For what purpose? I don't have a purpose. You either, I suppose. No purpose? Well then... give me my money back. Are you nuts? What's going on? There are lot of persons to interview in German. Did you get an answer from Bergsaberg? Everything is set up, so we can start here. The Palatina, I think. His book isn't available in French. We'll use Miribel's document. Of course, she wanted to take the trip. Thank you. - Will you be at the office, tomorrow? - Yes. I'll do a summary report and call her. And then call me right after? - Her number is 18-69, correct? - Yes, that's it. The number of musicians needs to be agreed too. Especially strings. Playing outside may cause problem. Ask her what she thinks of it. Anyways, everything is set up for tomorrow morning. Also... Hello? He'll call back. Yes, hello? Excuse me. We'll get to that tomorrow. There is no hurry. Yes. I have to go now. Alright, see you tomorrow. Rudy Courtois. It must be him. Your thief? You're right. What was his voice like? - Will he call again? - Of course. It's he who needs you. You didn't get it at all. It's I who needs him. And you as well if you meet him. "He'll return at night... "like a thief." I felt in something in his gaze... in his weaknesses, like an indraft. Like someone suffocating. Trying to make amends, if it's not too late. He is not born yet, do you get it? I didn't handle it well. You've got to help me. It'll take at least two of us. - You approve, don't you? - I do. But remember Catherine. I'm waiting to see. Is he handsome? Handsome? I don't know. I think he'll please you. He smells like a wet dog. Here he is. Alright. - What about him? - This one is for you. What should we do? Get clear! MAIN BATH HOUSE Yes? Mr. Carpentier wants to make an appointement. I can't see him today. What should I tell him? What about the 10th? Excuse me. Yes, hello? Darling! Is everything OK? I'm just calling to say hello. So kind. How are you? It's so hot today. Not much here. I had a rest and took a nap. You did right. Has anyone called? No. No one. I'll certainly get home early this evening. Don't drive too fast. I won't, I promise. Bye. Yes? I don't know what's going on. He's always in my thoughts. I love him. Do you think he'll come back? Yes. But... don't hunt him up any longer. It's time to respect his freedom. It's in freedom that God manifests Himself. But he has no reason to come back. What do you know? There are certainly reasons you both ignore. But if you really love him, you must remain clear headed. With clear consciousness of your similarities and of your differences. But beware, this affection could turn possessive or embittered. Incidentally, you can count on Valentine to help you. Me as well. Just give me a call. Thank you, François. You know... I would like to have your blessing. That's what I came for. Do you feel so much threatened? Not threatened. But I want... this cross between him and me. It is not actions but heart that counts. Thank you, François. I have a surprise for you. He has called. Who? Your wet dog. Rudy, of course. So what? It went very well. He seemed very eager to see you again. So I invited him over for lunch tomorrow. Did he accept? Well yes, of course! It was like we already knew each other. That's what he said, by the way. Did I do wrong? I don't know. Really. Don't be afraid, darling. Everything will be alright. We have nothing to lose, don't we? He asked me if I was as curious as you. I said, "much more curious". How hard your heart is beating! Why didn't you tell me earlier? I don't know. I wanted you to be close to me. To feel what you feel. Good morning, sir. Hello. Hello. These flowers are wonderful. Étienne never offered me any. I didn't except you to be like this. So what did you except? I expected you to be more... more serious. - Do I look like a wanton woman? - I didn't say that. More... - Severe? - Yes. Am I a severe woman? My God! - You don't like aubergine? - Not at all. - What do you want instead? - Nothing at all. I'm fine. It's wonderful here. Do you like countryside? I can't say. It's very beautiful here. Why won't you stay here for the weekend? Nobody's expecting you in Paris. There are some wonderful walks around here. Well? You stay here? Yes. Is the gearbox automatic? No, that's the engine starter. - Get in, I want to learn driving. - Okay. Enjoying yourself? It's amazing! Shift gears. Shift to 2nd gear. Pull it. Very well. Slow down. Just like that. - Pretty good. - It's amazing. Shift to 2nd gear. Let's stop here. Turn now. Alright, put the handbrake. Everything okay? So you're happy? I am. Why? Everything's nice around you. A wonderful wife, a amazing house. Your whole life is like that. That why I don't get what you're looking for with me. You know... I'm not easy to live with. I'm a kind of... a troublemaker. I wonder what your wife thinks about it? Valentine? She's the one who invited you. Listen to me. For Valentine and me, happiness... isn't enough. When we got married, she told me something that remained between us. "I love you so much that I can't love only you." So your presence here, that's the way we love each other. I might make you change your mind. It's a matter of being resilient. Exactly. Better watch out. You might get hurt. Two aces. The queen of hearts. With the thumb and forefinger. Got it? Here we go. Right hand... left hand... Where is it? This one here! No, this one there. But listen... That's fantastic. I want to try. - Like this. - The thumb and... I know! You're clumsy. Valentine gets a zero. Why don't you try? I'm going to show you. When he holds it like this, you can see the card. So hide it like... I knew it. You and simulation. You couldn't even make a lie. Well? I wish you a good night. May I? Good night. Good night. Come here, Rudy. Come. This way. This way. There you go. Rudy! Come here. No, no! Look. Slowly. There. Look. Rudy, Rudy. Gently now. Don't be afraid. Gently. Come on, Rudy. The handgun. What? You must remove it. - Hurry! - What is it? - Hurry! - What is it? Remove it. In the pocket. Slowly. In the pocket. Hurry! It hurts too much. Rudy! Étienne. If he wakes up, tell him we went out. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH THAT I CAN'T LOVE ONLY YOU VALENTINE, SEPT. 13th. What train goes to Paris now? The next one will leave at 6 pm. "I have to always think about Queen Esther "who's been chosen amongst her own "to support her people in front of the King. "But I'm very poor "powerless "and little Esther "and my people is waiting "like the Canticle's fiancée. "My heart also belongs to my King's desire "who'll return "as he promised. "Though the king... "Though the king who has chosen me "is tremendously great." "This text has been handed down by Aldegonde "her schoolfellow at Husserl, "who couldn't recognize Edith's way of thinking "due to its Jansenist point of view." I'm leaving. What's wrong? I can't stay here anymore. I'm suffocating. I won't get used to it. Forget it already. It's too late. I'm screwed. I always need to be in a rush. At 300 km/h. Here... I feel like being trapped. I want to scream and break everything apart. If it's so, leave. Is this little game over? Shut up or I'll make you regret it. - Anything I can do for you? - No. Nothing. That's the point. Otherwise... we'll have... to get much far. Watch out. Valentine may blush. Well, well. Why did you take the money you left here back? In order to give it to you. You're suffering. I hate you. What are you going to do now? The usual. Is it that serious? - You have my number in Paris? - I think so. Goodbye. Hey. You know... It was really nice anyway. Very classy. I'll remember it. Hey. Beware of the tricker. - What did you say? - Alright, take it easy. Go on. Split. Rudy. Come with me. Come. Beat it. Come with me. What's going on? Put him out. Here. Your dough. Take it back! I don't need it anymore. We're all square. Beat it. I order you to flee. What were you thinking? I'm done with you! Got it? Don't leave again. Never again. "She had... "a genuinely virile spirit. "And finally, "Her interests... "during the last years in Germany." Is it okay? - We've already done this part. - Think so? No. "There were questions... "some questions concerning "the female philosopher." Call for the third booth. Hello? Yes. It's me. No, I just wanted to say hello. That's fine. See yout there. See you, darling. Tell me... has anyone called? Well. See you. Hey! Tell me! Hold on. I have something to tell you. Where is Rudy? What do you want from him? He must call me. Tell him. He doesn't belong to you. No. To you neither. Anyways, He'll always return. Even if he returns to your home. A gang like ours can't be easily broken. You'd better give up. It's a advice. You're lucky to deal with us. It's not personal, but you'll have to pay of course. Do you give him money? Very little. What a waste! What if he asks you much more? I'll think about it. And what if we need this money fast? By the way, Do you know he's underage? If cops know about it, it'll cost you dear. Morons. Forget it. You're lucky. Here is an advice. Beware of Rudy, he's not your kind. Beat it. One more thing. We have never met. Got it? Hello? Yes. What? Hello? Yes, I know him. Yes. That's right. Where is he? I'm coming. I've got to go. What did he do? I don't care. - You want me to come with you? - Don't worry about it. I'm here for Rudy Courtois. Just a moment. It took no time. No. But you took your time. Sir, we're waiting for you. Go on, move. The Courtois case, Commissioner. You recognize him? Yes. Do you have your papers? Since when do you know Jean Courtois? Jean? Yes, Jean! By what name did you know him? Rudy. And then? I've known him for two months. We found this in your protégé's pocket. Do you recognize it? Yes. It belongs to my wife. He says that you gave it to him. Is that true? It is. You're kidding me? You give a vagabond your wife's jewellery. No. She gave it to him. How do you know? If he had stolen it from her, she would have told me. Why did you come here that fast? To take him with me in case you set him free. I'm standing surety for him. Take him here. He'll be here in a few seconds. You may be seated. No. Thanks. He came for you. You're lucky. This gentleman doesn't even know your first name. Tell him. Jean. Alright, get out of here. What should we do now? Whatever you want. Are you coming? I didn't think you'll get up that early. Indeed, but sunlight waked me up. I felt like having a walk in the garden. It will be all wet. Everything okay? Don't you eat anything? I'll be right back. You're in a hurry? Oh, yes. Tell Valentine that I'll call her at 1 pm. If you hear anything about me, you'll tell Valentine, right? I will, but it won't be that easy. You can stay here and have a rest. - See you, Étienne. - Goodbye, Rudy. - Jean. - See you later, Jean! I don't come here often. That's so beautiful. You're all wet. What is it? It's amazing. If only life could always be like this. Look at me. No, look at me! I'm leaving. It's over. Definitely. I know, this is horrible but everything isn't lost. Take pity on me! Étienne would take pity on us. Oh, no. You don't even know him. Rudy! Rudy! It was the first time. Rudy, I love you! That doesn't matter. You know? Yes. Get in. - What are you doing here? - Georges is looking for you. Tell him it's over. Go! We won't see each other for a while. Here is an address. He's my best friend. This home address. Take it. I'll asked him your news. It can't be. I'll give you money if you need it. He'll understand the whole situation. He'll help you. He already knows all about you. Well, as much as I do. You're the one I need. I need to be sure of it. My money... my house, my wife... What about me? It's you! So you don't understand me anymore? What am I going to do? You always tried to get away from me, didn't you? Even acting as sleep-walker. You wanted to impress me, right? Yes. And Valentine? Why Valentine? - I don't know. - Figure it out! To harm me a bit more. Yes. Though... It's exactly the opposite. Don't move. Come on. Étienne! It was time we meet again. Come on. I've nothing to say to you. Beat it. Don't go. Your guy doesn't need to hear this, he could be unpleased. Good evening. What a sweet guy. Étienne, be carefull! Étienne, hurry off! Don't go. Rudy! Beat it all. Drop it. Don't do that. Drop it. Jean... Subtitles: depositio, besmel
