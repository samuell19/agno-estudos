They'll kill dad and everyone else as well. Yeah, but your father deserves to die. Yeah. Why should we help? He's a prick! Is this the truck my father was to steal? Don't you know what you've done? You're going to to get the whole town killed! Enough is enough! No way. This is evidence. We can't let them get away with it! What evidence? Is it worth people dying for? Saengdao. They're carrying napalm into our homeland and burying it in our backyard! I don't care if its evidence. You can't let all those people die. We must find a way to help them. You're all cowards, the lot of you. You aren't half the soldiers My father told me of. Where's the bravery he always said you had? You suck. How many have to die? Don't you have a duty to protect our people? How can you live with yourselves? And you call yourselves soldiers! I've wasted my time praying for you guys. I can't believe I had faith in you guys. Dad didn't die in vain! This truck, along with you guys. Should save the people he protected! OK. But we need weapons. Yeah, but where are we going to find enough firepower? Dad's been stockpiling US weapons. He hasn't sold any yet. I know where he keeps it too! I got you into this mess. Anyone who doesn't want to go... I'll understand! It's time we took that oath! We're Thai soldiers, aren't we? Let's kick butts... for the Sarge! Here's to brotherhood with Sarge, forever! This is for you, Sarge! Here, Dun. I'll never forget you, Sarge! To Sarge. If I've wronged you, forgive me Sarge. Sarge will be avenged! What did he say? I'm fucked. 8 years in grade 4! Moron! Go get the truck or he'll kill me! Yankee. Shoot the mother fucker I couldn't give a shit! Listen, listen... Fuck me, Radom. You can waste that one! Wait... the truck is coming! Go! I'm Bar girl Fuck, What now? Help me. Let, me go. Help me. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Dad! Sarge! American losers, American losers! Take that, you bastards. Meet my red shorts, you assholes! Sarge, you OK? Sarge. Sarge, we thought you were fucked! Not yet. I thought you were dead! I gotta get home! How the hell you survive? It's a long story. You really wanna know? Yep! You're in no shape to leave yet. You should rest some more! I can't. My men are in trouble! Here, these are yours. I kept them for you. Are you a soldier? Yes. Good. I used to be a soldier too. What's wrong with your arm? An old war wound. No matter who the enemy is. If we band together. We can win! Yeah, but we can't match their fire power. It's been in my family for generations. Ever since the battle of Bangrajan! It's protected our homeland many times before. Dun, what do you think of my red shorts now? Sarge... They are bloody magnificent. Yeah, and what else? When you've got them on there's no fucking stopping you! Good! When this is over, I'll get you all a pair. Let's go! Sarge, hook it up. Dad! There! Here, here. This way, no that way. No, this way. Quick, get the chopper. Don't let them get away! Are you nuts? We're not birds you know? How the fuck do we get up there? I don't care. Just find a way! Dun, come with me. Fuck yeah! Go to hell, prick! Sarge! Fucking yank. I'll kill you. Dun. What are you thinking? Now who's gonna fly this thing? We're fucked now, Dun. Dun, jump with me. My balls, my balls. Sarge. No long after, the Vietnam War was over. The trucks and their lethal cargo, were returned to the US Army. Mother. Monk Knob, Monk Knob? The fuck's wrong with your mom? Come on now Knob, You're mothers gone to heaven. Monk Knob. What the fuck you crying for? Fuck off, Mutt. You're a scumbag with no-one. There'll be nobody at your funeral! Fuck you. Have some respect, the lot of you! Monk Knob, you too! Today's your mother's funeral. Have some respect. Your mother needs merit to go to heaven. Don't ruin her chances! I've often wondered why the Thais cremate and the Chinese bury their dead. You dumb Chinky. That's offensive. We only bury those who cark it by accident. Knob's mother carked it by accident. She up and died of shock! If your mom carked it by accident, she ain't going to heaven then! Yeah, looks like she's going down! Sure. Pity! Don't listen to them Knob. Have some respect. You uncultured heathens! Shooting strait today. Got the red shorts on again? You looking for trouble are you? No. And what's with the fucking cigar? - Sarge... -Yeah, you wanna fight? You can eat my shorts. Yeah, choke on them. Dynamite! - What - Dynamite! Mom. Hey Knob. You mom's gone to heaven for sure now! Fuck you, fuck the lot of you!
