Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! ...away from this west side ghetto, ...where it all began early this morning... ...with a police raid on an after-hours drinking parlor. There have been some reports of gunfire. Police are under orders not to fire. More than 200 looters have been arrested so far. Police officials say they do not have enough men... ...to worry much about the looters. They are there to protect the firemen. But that is why you elected me. To bring about change. But during this time, ...it's important that we all settle down. I'm angry, too. This city has problems, especially with the policemen. We have problems. However, ...change doesn't happen overnight. But change is coming. Let's work together! Nah! Bring Stokely Carmichael down here! We don't wanna hear from your ass! Look here. This is what I need you to do! I need you to not mess up your own neighborhood. This is your home! Yeah, burn it down! Burning it down is not the answer! Burn it down! Burn it down! Settle down! Settle down! Engine four, let's relay! Come on! Roll it back! You gotta roll it back. What the fuck! Get out of here! ...we've made state police... ...and National Guardsmen available... ...to assist in dealing with what is a case... ...of lawlessness and hoodlumism... ...and to protect the persons and property... ...of people in the areas involved. ...where snipers hide on rooftops, ...the violence continues. US Army paratroopers, National Guardsmen, state and local police... ...are continuing the fight against a handful of snipers. On the city's west side, a 150-block area is off-limits to everybody. This is no man's land, an area of destruction and devastation. ABC newsman Tom Mclntyre says... ...it's hard to believe that this could happen in America. But here it is, in Detroit, the nation's fifth largest city. And I am also indicating that I will promulgate... ...such rules, orders and regulations... ...as I deem necessary to protect life and property. 18-40! Rally point! Rally point A! Sniper in the window! Third floor window! Stand by! Hold your fire! Move back! Hey! ...to loot stores... ...or to burn buildings, ...or to fire rifles from the rooftops. That is crime. And crime must be dealt with forcefully... ...and swiftly, and certainly under law. ...that, "Violence never accomplishes anything," "...my fellow Americans." Don't you see, the real problem with violence... ...is that we have never been violent. We have been too nonviolent! Excuse me! I need to go down this road to get to work. What did I say? Back! I need to go down this road to get to work, Ford Assembly. Hold on! Where you going? Hey! Let him go! You cannot go this... So sad. It's preventable, you know. That's the worst part. Look at this. This looks like fucking 'Nam. You believe this is the USA? And we're to blame. By standing by, the trouble started. Now this. They're crazy. They're not crazy. They know exactly what they're doing. This is gonna be worse than '43. They're looking to us, and we keep letting them down... ...left, right, and center. Take this motherfucker right here. Halt! Halt! Halt! Get back! Hey! Get back off the street! Hey, Phil! Come on! Hey, Phil! Forget him! Come on! Fuck! Yeah. How the hell are we supposed to stop them? What a fucking specimen, huh? What... What are you doing under there? I just live down the street. If you can go get my wife Roberta? You want me to call the ambulance? No, no police! Just, please, Roberta. ...have been rushed into as many areas... ...as they can cover, protecting police. Looters carry off thousands of dollars' worth of goods... ...with a gay sort of leisure. Many negro shop owners put up signs... ...reading "Soul Brother" to avoid damage. But the fire bombers and looters... ...are indiscriminate. I'll get to him when I get a second. Write your address and your date of birth. Talk to him! Where am I supposed to put him? I don't care. Take him to your house! There's no room! Sergeant! Homicide detectives wanna have a word with you. ...for two more in holding or not? Step back from the goddamn counter! Come on, move! Behind the door! Hey! Whose prisoner is this? Don't talk to me! For God's sake. Krauss, in here. I need you. Go, come on. Guys, come on. Out. ...shotgunned in the vicinity of Virginia Park. Did I hear earlier you shot a black guy? I missed, called it in.

We're not too far from the Algiers. Let's just go there till all this blows over. I'm sorry, I've been working... ...straight shifts since the riots started. Yeah, that guy you shot at didn't make it home. Ambulance found him bleeding out under a car. Are we sure it's the same guy? He's the only Virginia Park shooting today. You carry a shotgun, he had shotgun wounds. You wanna play ballistics? Jesus Christ, I'm sorry. That's it? What else? You shot him in the back. Right. He was... He was running away from me. Where else do you want me to shoot? My point was him being no threat to you. In hindsight, but I'm thinking, ...why is he running away from me, ...if all he did was steal some groceries? What if he killed somebody in that grocery store? He's avoiding the police. What do you assume from that? You don't assume. If he had a weapon in his hand, that's another story. We don't shoot for robberies. Detective, you know it's a war zone out there, right? Yeah. 10th had to shut down. They're destroying the city. We're facilitating that with the message we send, ...which is that it's okay, go ahead, burn down your houses, ...rob a store. It's total chaos. And... Where does that lead us long term, Detective? All right, kid. Thank you. Anytime. I'm recommending murder charges. You go back to work, wait to hear from the DA. Yes, sir. And kid... Calm down out there. Thank you, Detective. All right? Forget it. - Are you in trouble? - I'm fine, so forget it. He's doing his job, same as you and me. Yo, we need to split up, man. Five brothers together, you know they gonna say we a gang. Shit!

Yeah, well, the Ritz ain't got you behind the counter, so... Look, all I got is a room in the annex... ...out back down through the breezeway. $11 a night, you pay in advance. That's cool. Voilà! What you expect for 11 bucks? Hey! How am I supposed to know what time it is? - What you gonna do? Shoot me? - Get off my street! Do it! Go ahead. I will kill you right the fuck now. I'm guarding that grocery store right there. I'm guarding it. This my nephew. I'm so sorry, I apologize. I'm gonna take him away. Come on. I ain't your nephew, motherfucker!

Hello. Everything is fine. No trouble here. I'll sleep when they stop rioting. Good night, sir. I'm gonna go talk to those white guys. I'm gonna make sure they don't start shooting at us. Relax here. - ...to know where we are? - I'll be right back. Hey, fellas. Melvin Dismukes. I'm with United Security, I'm guarding that grocery store across the street. I come bearing gifts. Oh. Thank you. Isn't this nice, boys? Thank you. I don't have my usual appliances. You got any sugar? Oh, don't push it, man. We were at Black Bottom earlier today. We actually took sniper fire. Had one, right by here. Ain't no snipers here, man. Just you and me... ...and the people partying in that motel. How long do you think this is gonna last? Yeah, how long till these negros, people, quit? What do you think? How the hell am I supposed to know? Is Morris home? It's Larry. I can't find those guys anywhere. No, no, no. No, he's fine.

(VOLUME OF JAZZ MUSIC INCREASES) Can we please let Trane speak? What the hell? That's beautiful. So sad that he died. He was young, right? He was 40. But he used his years. Let me tell you, that man lived. Unfortunately, it was heroin. Now, we know Trane did not overdose. Don't put a rumor on that, man. I didn't say Trane overdosed. But John Coltrane was a junkie for years. Love Supreme Trane was high on dope. I'm not saying that's taking anything away... ...from the man as a spiritual example. He's one of my many saints. But heroin is what killed his liver. I heard the FBI poisoned him. FBI. You wanna know how I know? John Coltrane's wife is a Detroit musician, ...same set as me. Oh, so now you a trained expert on Coltrane? ...of the rioting here in Detroit. The National Guard has been called in... ...and more than 3,200 people have been arrested, most of them negros. Updates will continue throughout our broadcast... Why is everything always so violent? You ask your people that? Try a little revolution with the English, ...all that "liberty or death?" That ain't so non-violent at all. I highly doubt she understands your logic about liberty and death. Well, let's put it in layman's terms. Slide over, stripes. You see, ...you white, ain't you? Brother. You white, right? See, y'all don't have to deal with... ...the police nearly as much as we do. Unless, of course, you're some... Uncle Tom handkerchief head, you know? It's like... When you're black, it's almost like... ...having a gun pointing right at your face. You understand that? It's like this. Hey, boy! Get your hands off my plate. Put the hot dog... Step away from the mustard! Put your hands down! Don't... You nervous? This like police brutality or something, man. Oh. Oh... So you gonna tell me how to do my job now? - I'm not... - So now you're the police officer... ...that tells me how to do my job on my street? What you doing on my street, nigger? See, that's the way they like to express themselves. You know, "My street, my house, my car." That way they can take everything from you. - Larry. - So again. What you doing on my street, boy? Did you do something wrong? I ought to blow your head right off. Get that gun off me, man. - Or what, boy? - I said, get that gun off... Oh, my God! You shot him! Carl! Lee! Lee? Hot dog, please! You're nuts! It was just a starter pistol. It just starts races. It don't kill nobody, I'm just demonstrating white power. So am I, honey. Sweetheart, baby, it was just a joke. Y'all can go and get the hell out, ...you and your partner. Thought they could take a joke. I'm performing. Sorry, Larry, they're usually nice guys. No, come on. Don't let those fools bother you. Why don't we all go to my room and relax for a little bit? We told a friend we'd drop by. Come on. Find me later. See you! But Karen though... She was looking at me. - Karen wasn't looking at you. - Karen was feeling me, man. She was like, "Hey, Aubrey!" I was like, "Hey, Karen!" We should teach these pigs a lesson. Them right down there. ...they're gonna shoot us back, right? How they gonna know where it came from, Lee? - It's not even possible. - Just calm down, man. Man, you chicken. ...that they can't be picking on us all the time. Y'all gotta be with the program! We're gonna get our asses beat! One, two. Would you... You guys okay? - Who's shooting? - From down there, maybe? It could be any one of those buildings. Did you just hear that gunshot, baby? No, I didn't hear anything. Anyway, you know if I get a record deal, ...we gonna drive a Cadillac, right? Look, check him out! Run, Mr. Cracker, run! By the Algiers, could be a sniper. - Mike? - I'm okay! I didn't get hit!

We got a swimming pool and I think... ...we need to spend some time together. My mom says I can't leave the house. But I want to. Your mama, right. Thanks. Hey, y'all, there's a bunch of police outside right now. Why would I be playing? Yo, is they lost? I don't know, man, but it look like... ...they coming right toward the house. Get in position!

Fella here had a knife, tried to go for my gun. Yeah, I heard him shout, "Get off my gun!" Yeah, it all happened pretty fast. I guess you had to defend yourself. Get back against the wall! Move! - Chill! - They killed Carl! Don't be stupid, boy! Stay against the wall! Okay, okay. Shame. A young kid like that. Still, he might be the shooter. We need to find out. I found them with the big nigger down the end. Same room? - You find anything? - Nothing. No gun? No. Some bad news. One of the guests is dead. He tried to take a police officer's weapon, ...ended up getting shot. Carl Cooper. May he rest in peace. Amen. Amen. Now let's not be stupid in this situation. We still have a crime scene here and you're all suspects. Each and every one of you. Don't look at me! Turn around, face the wall! Was Carl the one doing the shooting? Huh? Somebody better start getting honest with me. Hey! I want that gun! We looked around, we didn't find a gun. Doesn't mean it's not here! Go find it! You, too! I got nothing against you people. But you need to tell me where the gun is. You need to tell me... ...who was doing the shooting. I'm only gonna ask so many times. Who did the shooting? We don't know. You do fucking know! You were upstairs, who was doing the shooting? - Who was doing the shooting? - You doing the shooting, man! Lee! Carl ain't got no gun. What's that? You're the ones out here killing people! Say that to my face! I said, Carl ain't shoot nobody, man! Yeah, all right. Stop your goddamn crying! Face the door! You, too. Face the front! Why don't you pick that up and defend yourself? Hmm? It's easy, look. You sure you don't wanna try and stab me? I'm not gonna play your game. That would just give me an excuse to do... ...what we both know is gonna happen anyway. Right? Man, y'all some crazy crackers! You still a cracker. Shut the fuck up, all right? Shut up. Was it Carl? Let me tell you something. If you think that you can shoot at innocent people... ...and get away with it, ...you are dead wrong. My partner said, "stand up." - Look, I'll take him. - So stand. Come on, come on. - Come on. - Get the fuck outta here. Nobody's gonna talk? Nobody knows who the shooter is? Nobody's going to admit shit? All right. Then start prayin'. Start praying. What's the matter, boy? You don't pray? You don't go to fuckin' church? Forgive our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us. ...until you tell me exactly what is going on here.

They're lookin' for a sniper, okay? But Carl wasn't no sniper, man. So if a guy goes for your gun, ...you gonna let him have it because he's black? Come on! A cop has a shotgun like yours, right?

Where is it? What's going on? I gotta tell you, Detroit PD is going nuts in there. What do you mean? Looks like they're terrorizing suspects, ...beating and so forth, trying to get a confession. Well, that's not correct, they got their civil rights. That's what I'm saying. Don't look right to me. Don't lie to me! Where's the gun? All right. Let's let them have the case. I don't wanna get involved in any civil rights mix-up, you know? Let's go. - Where's the fucking gun! - I don't know! Who's the shooter? No. All this looks stolen. I searched the whole room, myself. He wouldn't even tell you, huh? All right. Get Demens to watch the line. Come with me. Get in there. Quickly. Come on! We need you in here. Get the... Get on the goddamn floor. We're gonna hold the line. Why you gotta fuck them, huh? What's wrong with us? You need to tell me... ...where the gun is and who the shooter is... I swear to you there's no gun. There's no gun, man! Okay. I don't know nothing, man. No! ...or the next one is for real. Understand? This'll make 'em talk. Watch this. That one didn't even kick. That's what happens when you lie to us. Who else wants to kill one? You wanna kill one? Okay. All right. - Officer, wait! - Shut up! I told you I don't know where the fucking gun is, man. - You looked for it, right? - Shut your mouth! Hey, man. You gotta tell me where the gun is so all this can stop. - Where's the gun? - I don't know. - You can't do this shit! - Shut the fuck up! This is Detroit. We don't bluff. Now, be quiet, ...or the next one will be for real. I killed that nigger. There you have it. Get your goddamn hands off her. Turn around. What's your part in all this, huh? Probably know where the gun is. Probably know who the shooter is. I don't know what you're talking about. And you're lyin' to me. Get away from me! You think you'd get a pass 'cause you're white? No, whore. You don't. Find out what she knows. It's okay. Easy, easy. It's just you and me. Take a seat. Sit down. Sit down. Ouch. You all right there, miss? Is everything okay? You're okay though, right? Don't touch me. Try to keep calm. What are you doin' living here? It's a hotel, isn't it? Yeah. So you're up here for a while? Some, uh, ...prostitution, maybe? I'm visiting from Ohio. My father is a judge. And your father, he knows you're here, right? Living amongst the blacks? Are there black people here? I didn't notice, I'm colorblind. Really? What color am I? Blue? You look yellow to me, sir. - You're working prostitution. - No! You're fuckin' these black guys, right? They're kids. What's the matter with you? I'm trying to protect you, miss. Stay there. She's a hooker. All right, fuck it. Come here. So, you are the pimp. No, sir. I think you're mistaken. We've got all the time in the world. We are gonna get to the bottom of this. So think very carefully about how you answer our questions, ...or you're gonna end up like your friends in the next room. How long you been pimpin' out these young girls, huh? Destroying their bodies and minds. I just met 'em. I ain't pimpin'. I just got back from the war. You're a veteran? Yes, sir. You wear army green, ...you try to be a fucking serviceman. We don't need pimps in the army. Probably drove a fucking supply truck. I was airborne. Move to cover! Get down! Get down! Down, down! Don't worry about it. If it was anything, they'd grab us. Larry, what are you doin'? Larry. Get back on the wall. Let's get the fuck up outta here. We can. Let's go. No. Come on. Come on. Fred, let's go. No, Larry. Stop. Come on, come on. Stay the fuck away. Hold your perimeter! Shut up! Fire! Fire! Snipers everywhere, tonight. Is that who was shooting at us? Huh? What do you gotta say? Fuck! Two deployments. Honorable discharge. - This is a fake. - No, sir. What's his name? I don't know. His name is Karl Greene. I wasn't asking you, I was asking her. You just said, "What's his name?" You're lucky I haven't broken your fuckin' neck, yet. All right, man. I see what you're trying to do. I'm not gonna cause any trouble, okay? But I'm not gonna lie down for you, either. What are you doin' in Detroit, huh? Like everybody else, I'm lookin' for work. All right. Get this motherfucker back in line. Give me back my government card, man. Why don't you get outta here? Run out the back door. Run. Right now, go! You know the one who was praying? He's okay, it's not him. And you can scratch off G. I. Joe. That little twerp with the big, fuckin' prayer. Yeah, it's not him. That leaves us with the big motherfucker who's in that room. I like him for it. - Okay. - Yeah. Flynn. Fuck! He's escaped. Well, we need another one. I know. Still... Still no gun. So, who wants to go next? Hmm? Please. Just, please, please. Officer, can I say something? There we go. Yes, you can. I think you have the wrong house. 'Cause nobody we saw... 'Cause nobody we saw here was shooting at the police. Please. It's possible we made a mistake. But I need to know for sure. Can't let a cop killer get away with it, can I? How about you, sweetheart? You wanna be next? Which one, huh? Which one? Get her outta here. Jesus! And her! Up! Upstairs! Shut up! You wanna cry, huh? I'll give you something to cry about. You wanna cry, huh? I'll give you something to cry about. I guess there are no weapons on your person. (LOUD FOOTSTEPS ASCENDING STAIRS) Stay over there and keep quiet. God. Aren't you ashamed of yourselves? You're the one checking out my tits. You're having sex with niggers. It's 1967, asshole. Honestly. It doesn't bother you? The Afro Sheen in their hair? The way it smells? You're on some trip. You think you can come into my city... ...and pimp out a bunch of young girls? I said it wasn't like that. I don't care if you were in the army. I'll drown all you pimps in the river until the city's clean. You gonna question them or I'm gonna take 'em outta here. Look. You might not be such bad girls after all. But be straight with me. Who was shootin' at the National Guard out there? Mister? I didn't see anybody shoot at the National Guard. I would tell you if I had. You would? You can think I'm a slut if you want, but I was raised right. All right. I'm gonna get 'em outta here. Let's get you covered up, okay? You too. Hey, can I get a hand? (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON POLICE RADIO) Fuck. Fuck those fuckers. You're fucking murdering those kids! Why don't you stop them? Don't concern yourself. They're just scaring them. It's an interrogation tactic. Are you nuts, Mister? I saw the bodies! Those guys are getting murdered in cold blood. It's not real. I didn't shoot that guy, and neither did the other. It's to get the guys to fess up about the location of the gun. Who said they even had a gun? I don't know. If they did, it was just a toy. It wasn't a real gun. Well, thanks for saving us. We gotta head out. She means, are you gonna tell the police where we are? No. We're gonna be okay. But those boys... Fucking stay there. You see that? See that shit? That is your fault right there. Look at it. You don't talk, that's what happens. Look at it. (INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER) At ease. That kid. Him. He was up there in the same room... ...as those other two delinquents. Yeah. Let's get our confession out of him, ...vacate the premises, all right? - Okay. - Demens should do it. Do what? You haven't killed a nigger yet. Uh... Well, I don't know about that. What's the matter, partner? Problem? Whatever you say. Which one? Come with me. I gotta ask you some questions. Please. Please don't kill me, please. Please don't shoot me, please. Where is the gun? I don't know. I swear to God, I don't know. Please. Please. I got no cause to shoot you. I ain't never shot anybody before in my life. Please! I don't know where... Please. Please, don't... They fucking killed him. So that's done. Good. Great job. I didn't think I could do it, but I did it. Boy, I feel funny. Yeah. It's the right thing. He'll talk now. What do you mean? Another one bites the dust. I bet some of you thought we weren't serious, huh? Well, we still don't have our gun... ...and we are running out of time, people. Who was the sniper? Just be honest with us so we can all go home. Jesus Christ, Marty. We weren't actually shooting the other guys. We're playing with them. What do you mean? Playing. Playing what? A game. A game to get them to talk, scare the shit out of 'em. Interrogation tactics. Fuck. This is strictly police business. Okay, listen. Listen. - Listen to me. - Oh, fuck. He grabbed your gun, all right, ...and you warned him, okay? And you were forced to shoot him, okay? Line of duty. - Get your fucking story straight. - Oh, fuck. Hey, get your head straight. I'm serious. All right, just take a minute. Stay here. Oh, God. Oh, fuck. Marty shot the guy. What? - He did? - Yeah. Point blank. We need to wrap this up and get out of here. We don't have a suspect. Should we just arrest them all? No, no, not now. We just need to get out of here, you know? And... Us and them. If they're smart, they're not gonna say anything, all right? All right. Let's do this. You come with me. You're free to go. But you don't talk about this to anyone, ever. You understand? 'Cause I got your name, ...and I know exactly who you are. I don't got your name. I don't know nothin' about you. Please don't kill me. Please don't kill him. What's this here? I don't see nothin'. Get going. We don't know nothin'. No, no, no, no! Relax. Listen. What if I told you you can run out that door right now, ...but you never talk about what you saw here? Understand? No, no, no! Listen to me. What do you see here? You killed him. You killed him. We're gonna try this again. I don't see anything. There's a dead guy right there. Please, please, please... Please, please, please... Hey. Oh, my God. Who could do this to someone? Hey, hey, hey. I'm here to help you, all right? Come on. Hey. I'm gonna get you to the hospital, okay? All right? Relax. Okay? Hey, hey, it's all right. Come with me. Come on. Come on. We're gonna get you there. Come on, brother. Don't you go on me, all right? Come on. Come on. We got him. Let's go. (PEOPLE CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY) Aubrey! Phone call! Aubrey, hey! You got phone call! - Say again? - You got a call from home. Something's wrong. Kid's in trouble or hurt, or something. Bet it's my youngest. He's always googy-googy. Yes? ...they found Aubrey dead this morning at the Algiers Motel. No. No. Aubrey's supposed to be at home. It's gotta be somebody else. What is this, Ma? A mistake? It's gotta be a mistake. Aubrey's got more sense than that. Well, baby, you never know. Let's go see. Is he there? (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE) Looking for a Dismukes. Appreciate it. Any of you fellas named Dismukes? Yeah, that's me. I have to ask you to come with us, sir. Is there a problem? No. I don't think so. Rather not have to ask again, though. Y'all tell the boss, huh? You got this? Come on, I ain't got all day. Take a seat. I assume this is about what went on at the motel? What happened at the motel? I was working security by Wisconsin. And on Tuesday night, we heard gunfire... ...coming from the area near the Algiers. Police was there. State police, National Guard. It was a lot of shooting. And when I went in there, three kids had been killed. No. - Yes, sir. - This right there, right? Is that what you're talking about? Yes, sir. Yeah. He was lying just like this. The blood was fresh. It hadn't congealed yet. So they were killed right before you got there? Yes, sir. You carry a.38, right? A revolver. Do you carry a revolver? I do have a.38. Hmm. You ever shoot anyone? - No. - Strike anyone? - Not the way you mean, sir. - What do I mean? Fellas, ...you know, sometimes, ...when a black guy's put in a position of authority, ...other black guys, they like to single you out, okay? Because I'm not supposed to tell 'em what to do. When we have these conversations, ...we do them in stages, okay? Stage one, witnesses. Stage two, suspects. What stage are we in? You don't know what stage we're in? No. Could you specify for me? You're a suspect. I didn't do it. The police... Ah, here we go. The police shot those kids. ...when you weren't inside the building... ...until after the shooting stopped? So, are you lying to us now, ...or were you lying just a minute ago? You need to answer me. All due respect, I am telling the truth. I'm not lying. I told you what I saw. I saw these kids... - We're here to help you, okay? - Yes, sir. Melvin, do you wanna go home? Yeah. I didn't do it. You're doing a real good job, honey. Eddie... Has he woken up? No, man. Hey. Larry. Hey, wake up, brother. Hey. Be gentle. You know where my little brother is? The police are saying Fred is dead, ...but I can't get nobody to tell me what's going on. What's going on? You tell us, man. The police... The police? They... - You have children? - Oh, yes. I have three boys. The oldest is 12. Then nine and seven. You know how youngsters are then. Oh, boy... The way they communicate, grunts and groans. My little cavemen. Especially boys. It's like they don't know if they wanna be slick, you know? That's right. They're still trying to find their place in life... ...and we have to allow for that. Uh-huh. Hmm. Well, I can see you want to go back there. Sure. We helped try to keep the riots down and keep the corner clear. What can you say... ...about having all this murdering and confusion? Everybody isn't thieves and murderers. I wish that things could be better for the negro people. Remember what I told you, and this whole thing's gonna blow over. All right? You did nothing wrong. I think I gotta say somethin'. Hey. You made... Demens. Something that took one minute... ...should not define your entire life. You understand? You made a mistake. You say what you need to say, ...and you move on. That's how you get out of this thing. - All right? - All right. Yeah. You don't have to lecture me, I know what to do. There you go. You were doing your job. You first, knucklehead! All right. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE) Flynn! I'll be with you in a few minutes. Well? Some things were said in there. Such as? You stupid... You motherfucker, you're dead. You're fucking dead. You too? We're all going down. Phil, listen. It's... - No. No. - Just listen to me. I got nothing to say without my union lawyer. Are you kidding me, you racist fuck? Get out of the car before I break your neck. I couldn't say for sure who went inside the building first. Um... There were five, ...maybe six state police. We have complete statements from your partners. We know you shot those kids. So just go from there. No. No. I don't recall doing that. Uh... Bang his head against the table. Might help. Hey. I'm trying to help here. I'm trying to be thorough. So, you wanna know... ...how many state police were on the scene, ...how many National Guard? I can't tell if you're stupid or smart, ...but I'm willing to find out. Don't say another word. Come on. What's the point? Coercive testimony will be tossed. Larry! Yo, you sure he's home? Give him a minute. Man, what? What's so important? They wanna hear our music at the studio! Oh, and they called you? Yeah, man. They said they tried to call you... ...but you never called them back. They wanna hear The Dramatics! So what? You Mr. Show Business now? This isn't professional. Larry! It's a record company, man. They don't keep banking hours. Come on. Listen, you guys had better sound good... ...because I'm broke. Let me hear that blend. Uh, yes, sir. - Are you guys ready? - Yeah. One, two.

Look, a song ain't words on a page, man. That ain't music. Music is what you put into it... ...and you can make that whatever you want. I'm not singing so white motherfuckers can dance! Well, them pale motherfuckers ain't dancing for free! Since when do you care if white folks dance anyway? ...three negros were shot to death in a motel room. Police and the Guardsmen had raided the motel, ...searching for snipers. Later, witnesses to the shootings... ...said the three negros had been lined up... ...and shot in cold blood by the officers. Today, two police officers were arrested... ...and charged with the murders... ...of two of the negros shot in the motel. The officers, one with two years' service, ...the other with four... ...and no previous misconduct charges, ...were ordered held without bail. They pleaded not guilty. Their attorney said... ...the arrests were a shame and a pity. Police Commissioner, Ray Girardin, ...refused to discuss the facts of the case, ...except to say the two officers... Who do you got mail for? Larry! Larry, you got a letter. From the government. - Thank you. - You're welcome. ...until you tell me exactly what is going on here. Don't look at me. Turn around. Start praying! Get the fuck up! Get up! Bullshit! Stop fucking lying to me! I think you have the wrong house. ...both the prosecution and the defense... ...in their opening statements... ...reminded the all-white jury of the racial violence... ...that seared Detroit two summers ago. ...or military personnel started firing, ...to your knowledge, had there been any sniper fire... ...from inside the Algiers Motel or annex? And did you see anyone in the motel that night... ...with a gun of any kind in their hand... ...outside of police officers or military personnel? I saw someone shoot a toy gun at one of his friends. A toy gun. Isn't it a fact that your head... ...was against the wall for most of the evening? No, sir, it is not. My hands were against the wall for most of the evening. That's a fact. I asked about your head. My head is attached to my neck. It moves. This way, and that. ...to see what's behind you? Unless you have a special skill... ...this courtroom should know about? You said you saw the flash before you heard the gunshot. Was that your testimony? Well, it was pretty confusing. Well, which is it? Which came first? Did you see the flash? When did you hear the body hit the floor? I can't say for sure. You said you were just outside the door. You also said you might be confused, ...that you don't know what point in time... ...these things happened. So, are you confused? I saw the flash, just through the door. What I need to know is, ...did you see Aubrey Pollard... ...make a threatening move toward my client? Or are you perhaps confused on that point as well? Yes, sir. Being a military man, ...you would be able to distinguish... ...between the uniforms of a National Guardsman... ...and that of a Detroit police officer. Is that correct? I suppose. And so you say... ...that the man who took one of the victims into the room, ...that he was a National Guardsman? So I presume you know that because... ...he was wearing a uniform of the National Guard. Well, yes. I saw a guy in uniform take him back there. Did you see anybody else go back into that room? No. Would you have been able to see... ...if anybody else went back into that room? At the time, wasn't your head turned back around... ...by the police officers... ...that were still standing there with you? Yes. And so in one of the lineups, ...when you were asked to identify the officers who beat you, ...who did you identify? Do you see him here today in court? Him. And him. You just identified two of the defendants. Why would you identify only one of them... ...at the time of the lineup... ...if both of them took part in beating you? Which recollection for the record... ...would you say is the correct recollection? I just said I couldn't tell at first. When I went down to the police station, I was very nervous. And you will not be changing your story again then? This is it? This is the one you want us to work with? Objection. Asked and answered. He fired off a shot by my head and told me... ...to keep my mouth shut and lay still. Or the next one for real. And what did you do? I lie still. And were you mistreated in any way after that? Mistreated? Have you ever been arrested, sir? Sure. ...in prison for crimes you've committed... ...or alleged to have committed? Criminal acts. I don't know. A few. Yeah, you don't forget a beating like that. So you're certain that these three men... ...beat you and the others? Yes, I'm certain. Up until some army guy pulled me in a room... ...and told me to lie still. Then you heard him go out and tell them I was dead. ...as the "death game?" What did you see next? I didn't see nothin' lying face down on the floor, ...but I heard Aubrey yell, "Don't shoot." And he shot. I heard that. Now we've already talked to your cohort about, ...friend, Lee, about his criminal past. Have you ever had trouble with the law? I'm not on trial here. No need to introduce a new crime, sir. Just the ones already known. Or maybe you can start by telling us, ...how did the night begin? Party? A few drinks? Man, why? Why y'all talking about me at all? Man, y'all see a black man in court... ...and assume I'm the one on trial. Man, they killed my friends, man! They beat us! Lined us up and abused us and y'all doing the same thing! There's no justice here, man. Go fuck yourself, man. What? What you lookin' at? This is bullshit! I think what is clear here, Your Honor, ...is that these men were under an intolerable situation. They were under this duress, which we say was inherent, ...and for that reason, had no other choice. All right. All they had to do was keep quiet. If they kept quiet, they wouldn't be here today. But they made a statement, ...and that statement should be admissible. Not if the taking of those statements... ...violates constitutional rights. These policemen were owed an obligation. Advising them that they had a right to remain silent, ...they had a right to counsel, ...and that anything they said could be used against them... ...in a court of law. I don't think these defendants, ...because they're police officers, ...have any right to expect anything more from us, ...but they have a right under the Constitution... ...not to settle for anything less. I therefore rule the statements inadmissible. Wasn't that just a load of bullshit. Whew. Wow, man. That was... You know as well I do, ...those kids shouldn't have been killed like that. Yeah. It's a shame. Should've complied with a lawful order... ...and relinquish their weapons. But you're a solid guy though. Really. They know what they're supposed to do. Jury entering. All rise. All rise. ...with regard to the charges of murder... ...in the first degree and assault? On the assault, ...not guilty. ...not guilty. What we have witnessed today is a disappointment to the justice system, ...to the state of Michigan. This wouldn't have happened if they had found black girls... ...in a hotel with white men. No, sir. No way would they do this... ...to white men. That's the truth! And I don't care who knows it! Thank you, ma'am. Mr. Pollard, how do you feel about losing your son? How would you feel? How would you feel? It's a terrible pain. - A pain that never goes away. - Come on. Thanks, man. ...with a little bit of empathy? We are here today to witness... ...the justice system at work and we demand... ...that police criminality be treated the exact same way... ...as any other form of criminality. ...to judge the police for doing theirjobs. ...the same as any other form of criminality. ♪ Some people ♪ ♪ are made of plastic ♪ ♪ You know some people ♪ ♪ are made of wood ♪ ♪ Some people ♪ ♪ have hearts of stone ♪ ♪ Some people are up ♪ ♪ to no good Some people ♪ ♪ But baby ♪ ♪ I'm for real ♪ ♪ I'm as real ♪ ♪ as real can get ♪ ♪ And if what you're looking ♪ ♪ for is real lovin' ♪ ♪ Then what you see ♪ ♪ Is what you get ♪ We gotta snatch this, brother.
