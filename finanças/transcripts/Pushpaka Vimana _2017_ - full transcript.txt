Presenting 136/2016 case by Puttalakshmi versus Mahindra Deshpande and others. Prosecution may proceed. Your Honor, the accused Ananth Ramaiah, to avenge his father for petty reasons, he not only kidnapped and raped his six year old daughter, but also killed her to death by hitting her with a stone. It's been proved. The case is very clear. I feel there was no need for a re-trial. I feel that the defense has reopened the case just to waste the time of the court for her practice. Thank you, Your Honor. - Defense may proceed. Your Honor, there's a proverb in our scriptures. Truth always prevails. But they've manipulated so that the truth doesn't prevail and are fooling the court. So, I request the honorable court to re-investigate the evidence and witness. Oh, false evidence? Were you the defense in charge then in this case? Were you? No. I was not. No further questions, Your Honor. But I was present there. That's the truth. - Were you present there? Yes. I was there. Your Honor, I will tell only the truth. I don't have the need to tell anything other than the truth. I will only tell you what I saw, what I experienced and remember that incident every moment. 'I don't know how my mother looked. Father was everything to me.' 'He used to love me, I used to love my dad very much.' 'We both used to love watching aeroplane fly.' 'We both lived in a small house with big dreams.' 'We didn't have to spend money to see dreams.' 'We had to wait. Every day we would wait,' 'we used to feel happy seeing the aeroplane in the sky.' Aeroplane! Dad, the aeroplane is the last one waiting for us, right? We'll get the money we've collected, and we'll buy it tomorrow. - Look at the aeroplane. You were asking for it, right? Did you like it? - It is very nice. Is it nice? - Are you happy? Yes. - Dear. My daughter wishes to buy this from many days. Will you give this to her? - Who are you? We have been longing to buy this and are collecting money from a long time. We'll buy this tomorrow. Give it to us. Hey, give that to me. I have already paid for it. - Please, sir. I want it. - Hey, give that to me. Sir, it belongs to my daughter. - I said, give it to me. I have to give it to Puttu. - Who is this fellow, I say. Sir, please don't hit him. - Give it to me. Hey, give it to me. - It is for my daughter. Please don't hit my father. - Sir, don't hit me. Somebody come here. - Leave my father. Uncle, please leave him. - I got it. He is an insane man. Sir, please give it to me. - Come on, let's go. Ma'am, my daughter wishes to buy it. Come on, let's go. - Sir, please. Why do you allow such people in your shop? Dad, is it hurting? Is that the only shop where you get aeroplane? Dad will buy you aeroplane tomorrow. Dad, we wanted to buy that aeroplane, right? - Yes. Why did he sell that to them? They had the money. We just had wish with us. That's the reason. - Oh. That aeroplane was not good. So, we will go to other shop and buy it. So, we will go to other shop and buy it. Dad, don't imitate me. Dad, don't imitate me. Dad, during the war, did your grandpa really kill 22 men? Not 22, it's 23. It is said that four men would fall when my grandpa punched once. Oh! - So, Netaji awarded him with these medals. My father wished that he would join military. But he suffered from polio, so he couldn't join. Even I wanted to join military, but they scolded me and sent me away. But one day... You will surely join military. Right? Yes, Officer. Shall we leave? - Yes. Come. It's so cold here. - It's so cold here. You don't drink cold water. I've kept hot water in the pot for you. Okay father. - I've kept hot water in the pot for you. You should drink that. - Dad, even you do the same. Okay, bye. - Bye. 1, 2, 3! 3! Bye, Dad. Uncle. What is it? Do you know who I am? Did you get the aeroplane? I know another shop.

When I caught them, I severed their heads. The government brought me here and sentenced me for 14 years imprisonment. They've kept me in this guest house. His name is Jinke Krishna. You can tell him about yourself. Sir, mine is not anything special. I used to stand near the market, college, bus stand and sell sugar. Do you know what sugar is? I was standing in the hot sun and selling it, so the sugar turned brown. Police got confused that I am selling brown sugar, and brought me here. Shut up. You say they were confused. Can't they differentiate between sugar and brown sugar? My name is Venkatesh. I always say cuss words. So, people call me Cuss Venkatesh. I haven't done a big crime. Everyone goes for shopping when the shop is open. I used to shop after the shops were closed. That's all. He's Lambretta Lakshmikant. He is an old case. Someone had told me that government can't do all the work. You have to support them. It is government job to print notes. I didn't want to trouble them so I printed the notes myself. Is it wrong? So, they arrested me. Do you see this man here? His name is Thupaki Manja. He has done all kind of crimes till now. He is handling the underworld from here. Though he is uneducated, he writes destiny of other people. Did you hear everyone's story? Now tell us about yourself. Hey, what is your name? My name is Ananth Ramaiah. - What is your crime? I wanted an aeroplane. - Aeroplane? Boss, he must've hijacked it. Which aeroplane did you hijack? I'm talking about a toy aeroplane. Are you trying to act smart? I will thrash you. What is your crime? Speak up. - I don't know. Hey, don't ask him. Here are his crime details. Let's see what crime he has committed. Boss, he has kidnapped a child raped and murdered her.

After raping her, he murdered her by hitting her with a stone. Section 302. He has been proved guilty, he's been sent to gallows. 'Dad, why don't the fish come out of the water?' 'A fish cannot live without water.' 'I can't live without you.' 'Will we stay together forever like the fish and water?' 'Water and fish, you and I.' If someone is sitting idle there, throw the ball here. We are waiting. 'They make us work so hard. - Yes.' Did you see everyone is impressing him? If we let this continue, he will overpower us. 'There's lot of work to do.' I won't let him live, how can he overpower us? Beg me if you want, but you don't try to act smart with me. Ananthu, sleep here and rest. You look very tired. Listen to me. You're already suffering from pain. Sleep here. You saved my life. I won't keep your favor. What do you want, tell me. I won't refuse you. I will get it on the spot. Ask him soon, don't miss such a chance. He is true to his words. When God gives you boon, you shouldn't refuse saying you have fractured your hands. Come on, ask him. Will you smoke? Will you smoke marijuana? Come on, speak up. He's a fool. Will you drink? Don't feel shy. There are men in our country that got rich by drinking and not working hard. Accept it, even we'll get liquor to drink. Which brand? I want Puttu. Puttu? Which brand is this? Is it scotch? Puttalakshmi. My daughter. Daughter? 'I've sent the message in a ball.' 'Tomorrow the school children will come here for dance program.' 'My associates will send Ananth Ramaiah's' ' daughter in the same school bus.' 'When the bus enters the main gate ' 'and they park the bus near the store room,' 'you get the kid inside carefully. Okay?' 'Sir, but I have not seen the child.' 'She will be wearing blue color dress.' 'You have to bring her here and take her back in the same bus.' 'Did you understand? - Yes.' Where are you going? Sir, I lost my way and came this way. I have to go that way. Sir, please come. - Idiot. I told him to go to the canteen with the buns, but he's going near the bathroom. Hide inside. Sir, please don't. Sir! - Why are you panicking? Nothing, sir. I was in a hurry. In a hurry? Why? Speak up. Sir, I am suffering from stomach upset. I suffer from loose motions. - So, why were you going in speed? How can anyone go in slow motion if he has loose motions? Darn it. Go! Are you Puttu? Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Why did you leave me alone? I was so scared. My child! Thank you for getting my child here. What is this? Do you know what will happen if sir learns about this? Send the kid away. We've already endured enough. If we get caught, we'll be jailed for life. I will tell sir. You go to hell. Shut up. Don't talk as if you're the only honest man in this world. Look at that child's face. If I see that child's face, who will take care of my wife and children? I won't stay quiet. I will inform them. Sir! Sir! Sir! - Don't shout. Uncle, please don't tell anyone. I will hide here. - Don't shout. Sir! - Please, uncle. Hey, who is it? Uncle, please. Don't tell. Sir! - What is it? What is it? - Sir... What is it? Why are you screaming? Do you have labor pain? No sir, there is a... There is a... - What is in your cell? Do you want me to put another door there? Do you want to escape? I will kill you. You scoundrel! What are you murmuring? Don't waste my time. What is it? What is in your cell? Sir, I need another bun. To hell with you. You are crying for a bun. Here, eat this. You're a glutton. Eat this too. Are you going to school or not? Your daughter is very sharp. Is she really your daughter? She's not my daughter, she is my world. She's a boon given by God to me and my wife. God has given you a boon for what you and your wife did in the dark. Dad, you're not a bad boy, right? Why did they put you in jail? Puttu, you shouldn't say it as jail. This is a school. - Hey! You shouldn't lie to the children. Puttu, this is not a school, but jail. They all are criminals. Everyone look like thieves. There's still two hours left for the program to finish. I have to take the kid and send her in the van. If not, we all will be in trouble. Listen! Come here. Did the program got over? A girl fell unconscious while dancing. Did the program get over? - Yes. We all are dead. No, I won't go. This is not done. You said three hours, but it is not even half an hour. Yes, it is not even half an hour. I had told you, but what can we do? Nothing goes as per planned. Come on. Hey, you stay here. Where are you going? Puttu, listen to me. Will you leave or not? Don't shout. - Dear, look, if you don't leave, we'll land into trouble. You can never come to meet your father again. Is that okay with you? Dad, can't I stay here? Don't cry, Puttu. Sir, she can stay here. I will hide her there. Puttu, if you stay here, you can't go to the school. He said this was a school. You're too much. Puttu, this is a school, but they won't teach you anything. They only give you punishment here. Even the headmaster is not good. He snatched my clothes. - This school is not good, right? Yes. - Think about it. Do you want to go to this school or that school? Let she go to that school. Puttu, you go to the school. When you get holiday, we can play. - Well said! Is this a park to play? Send her out first. Okay. You leave. Thupaki uncle will get you inside again. Promise? Promise? Boss, hurry up. Dad! Puttu! Puttu! Are you eating? - Yes. Is it delicious? We are dying with tension and you're eating. It's delicious. So, I am eating. Boss gave it to me. Even you eat. Dad, I don't want. - You should eat carrot. It's good for the eyes. - No, Dad. Eat it or this uncle will snatch it. She is eating everything we brought here. You say I will snatch it. Boss, what will we do now? Shall we confess our crime? We have hit the beehive, we have to escape. Do you expect us to go and confess? We have brought her here without anyone knowledge, so let's send her out the same way. Boss! Boss! Look there. She is hogging. Let she eat. I ordered it for you too. You eat. Do you want to go to foreign? Is this a child or LPG cylinder? She is farting so much. Uncle, it is a whistle given to me by God. We have to keep blowing it. My bad luck. Do your work properly. I will thrash you. Do it properly. Hey, clean that place. Manja, make a plan to send that girl out. How many days can we keep her here? Boss, let's keep the girl here for two days. Women from some association will come here in two days to do a children's program here, we'll send her through them. Venkatesh, beautiful women come to the jail. If you try, you can woo any of the women. Hey! - He is here. You scoundrels. Do you want women? Yes sir, do you know anyone? You always keep whispering to each other. You have come to jail after committing a crime. You still haven't reformed. You should be ashamed of yourself. Sir, we committed a crime and came to jail, but you're in jail without committing any crime. Do your work. He is staring at me. Hey, do your work. Madonna, don't stay quiet. Let's do something. God has given you such a nice body. Give my regards to your father. Tell him to get us married soon. Hey, this is the time for ghosts to have a peg and you're sitting and talking. Don't you have any other better work to do? I am in love with her. Even loving is a job. A man should do some work. Haven't you heard of the proverb? A man should always play. - Hey, idiot. It is not playing, it is 'A man should always work'. Forget it. Even a jobless man is called as man. Do you call a man as responsible who plays? Even the people in coma jerk. Won't we jerk? A human finds it difficult to control the words starting with 'K'. For example, tears, cough, anger, laughter, and defecate. Can anyone control these things? Oh, you're a scholar. Turn off the lights and go to sleep. You're right. Dad. Dad, wake up. Sorry, Dad. All this happened because I asked you for an aeroplane as gift. Dad will surely buy you an aeroplane. Everything will be fine. If everything has to be fine, you have to tell the truth to judge without getting scared. They will let you go. If I tell them the truth they will spit on my face. Please dad, you're not a bad boy, right? Dad is a not a bad boy. Dad, if you get released, we can go to temple. - Temple. Hotel. - Hotel. Park. - Park. We can go everywhere. - Yes. Dad. Dad, I think someone is coming here. Boss, the inspector is coming here. Boss, the inspector is coming here. Puttu, come with me. Where are you taking her? Hey! - Boss, don't take her there. Get her here. What is going on! I heard a girl's voice. Don't do drama. She was talking about movie, park, and hotel. Who is she? Will you tell me or shall I open the door and come inside? Hello. I was talking. I was telling him that this jail is hotel and park for us. That's it. Can't you go to sleep quietly? How is it possible to go to sleep quietly? What are they doing? Scoundrels! What can we do? Some men like hotel food more than the food women make at home. They both are enjoying. Even you come inside, we'll play a game. Venkatesh, don't try to act smart with me. I've forgiven many inmates and taken the blame on me. Tell me what crime have you committed? I will take the blame. I just defecated. How will take that blame on yourself? You scoundrel! If I talk to you, I'll have to clean my ears using dettol. Go to sleep quietly! Where are you going? This is such an exotic night. Seeing you I feel like kissing you on your lips. Come to me. You idiot. You trouble me so much. Let go of me. Idiot! Thank God, I escaped. This is a token to the Goddess. No, Madonna. You can't be in clothes. You all are jealous as she's in love with me. You've ruined Madonna's picture. Baby. Uncle, I put clothes on her. My teacher taught me to give clothes to the people who are poor. If not, the poor woman may catch cold. She can't catch cold. What have you done? She looks good in clothes. Idiot, respect the beauty. - Hey! If you put clothes on Taj Mahal, will it look good? If Silk Smitha wears silk sari, people will tear seats in anger. Oh, ma'am. Don't show your talent for the English women. I am feeling bored. Play a game. We'll play hide and seek. Yes. I will hide. 1, 2... - Move aside. 3, 4... - Didn't find any other place to play? Move aside. Hey, stop! What is this? What is this? Come on, at least play today. What? 'What is behind the blouse. What is beneath the scarf?' Can't you differentiate between a man and a woman? Move aside. Idiot, I will thrash you. Idiot. He has forgotten to differentiate between a man and a woman. Idiot. Hey, come on. Why did you pull my pants? Mada, isn't there any program today? Program? It's after two days. Idiot, I asked you for an idea. You said women are going to come. - I got confused with the date. Women are going to come here. - Sorry, boss. You want women? Come here. Come on. Manja, let it be. Stay quiet. Come out. Come on. - Boss. You gave me an idea? Come on out. Greetings, sir. - Tell me. We've received photographs of the function last week. If you select it, I'll send it to the press. Okay. How is the child who fell unconscious, feeling now? She is feeling better, sir. Boss, don't you think we all are going to land in trouble? If anyone learns about it, they'll punish us severely. We had taken her, you should've thrown this girl in a dustbin. Puttu won't go in a dustbin. She will go in an aeroplane. You take her in the helicopter. Hello, I was waiting for you. I was holding the stick. The weather is too cold outside. It's like Ooty. Come, let's play a game. 'It's cold outside.' 'It's cold outside.' Sir, play with him. He is waiting. Who all are involved in this? Speak up! Come on! The child is inside from two days. Couldn't you know? Were you sleeping? Sir, I had a doubt. But these idiots fooled me. Shut up! Don't you feel ashamed to say they fooled you! Go! Sir.. Did you send the child? Sir, she's in the office room. Why have you made her sit in the office room? First send her out! No, sir. Sir, it is raining. - Shut up! Sir, it is raining. Poor child. Sir. - Just do what I say. Go! Sir, please don't. It is raining. Please don't send her out. She will catch cold. Sir, I will be hurt. You'll be hurt? - Yes, sir. You are feeling bad for your daughter. That day when you killed that child by hitting her with a stone, didn't you feel bad? Sir, I didn't kill that child. You didn't? No, sir. I didn't kill any child. You killed her, now you're lying. No, sir. I didn't kill anyone. Darn it. There's always a power cut problem. Hello? - 'Please get Chandran's case file here.' Okay, sir. I'll get it. [indistinct crowd voice] Call the fire station! Come on! You open the cells. - Yes sir. No one should escape. - Okay, sir. Go! Come on out. Boss, Madonna's photographs. - Come with me. You want Madonna's photos. Doctor, who saved me? This man risked his life and saved yours. Had he not brought you here on time, you'd be in a very serious condition. Teacher, one moment. Teacher, I want a favor from you. Favor? Yes, ma'am. Dad! Dad! - Yeah! Puttu. Puttu, how are you? I am good, Dad. How are you? Dad, she is my teacher. Greetings. - Greetings, ma'am. I'm Puttu's class teacher. Your daughter is very intelligent in studies and sports. She is a topper in everything. Topper. Puttu is a topper. Dad, look here. I have drawn something. This is me, this is our house, and this is you. You're in jail. Dad, I had a nightmare last night. I saw a demon with two hands was trying to push me in the drain. I got scared. You shouldn't get scared. If a demon with two hands push you in the drain, God has four hands, won't He save you from falling? You're not a rat to get scared. You're the Goddess who is sitting on the lion. You can fight anyone. Even you fight with the enemies. You have to fight with bad boys. Ananth, time is up. Let's go. - She has come just now. Give me some more time. - Dad! Dad! - Please. Dad! - Puttu! Puttu! You're like a Goddess. - Ananth. You don't fear. - Sir is watching us. You go home. I'll come home soon. - Hey, come on in. Puttu, don't cry. - Dad! Dad! - Calm down. He will come. Please. - Dad! Dad! - Listen to me. Dad! Ananth, what are you doing here? Puttu. Come. Ananth, come on, let's go. - Puttu. Sir, Ananth Ramaiah's daughter is unwell, she has been admitted in the hospital. Father! Father! Uncle, I will stay with my dad. Please arrest me. I can't live without my dad. 'I am feeling sad after losing my son.' 'I was separating a child from her father.' 'Ananth is a decent man, how can he be a criminal?' 'Whatever, other than my rules,' 'humanity is more important.' Puttu, will you stay with us? What about dad? I will take you to meet him daily. You stay with us. Okay? Okay. Sir, listen to me. Sir! Sir! You're taking a wrong decision. Sir, it will be a mistake to get the child inside. If someone learns about it, other inmates will settle here with their families. Think about it, sir. - Sir will handle it. You stay quiet. Nothing will happen. - Hey! Will anyone lose their position knowingly? Sir, listen to me. Shankarappa. - Sir. You apply for leave the day after tomorrow. Leave? - Yes. There's a funfair in the village. It's very famous. We both will go there. Sir? Do you want queen? - Yes. Give it to me. I didn't get queen to show. Will I get a queen to marry? Why don't you woo a female prisoner? You're giving such filthy ideas to him. Didn't you have any woman in your life when you were young? Even I was in love, but my friend eloped with her in the pretext of helping me. Your friend betrayed you in pretext of helping you. Didn't you feel like committing suicide? I didn't even think of growing a beard, how would I feel of committing suicide? I was happy thinking that he will have to face my problems now. Won't he fall? He's talking about eating seedless fruits after losing his teeth. Hey, what are you doing? Sir, what is this? Sir has sent a special gift to your cell. Puttu. Puttalakshmi. - Shut up! Sir says it is a gift and you say it is Puttalakshmi. Yeah, dad! Cake. - This? This? - Bat. Uncle, there's a bottle in this picture. There's a kidney in this picture. Tell me what is the meaning of this? It means if you don't have money to buy full bottle, you can sell your kidney. It is wrong. It means drinking water will keep your kidney safe. Puttu, I am an illiterate. I didn't go to school like you did. No problem, I will teach you. No, I am feeling sleepy. You go and draw on the walls. You can teach me some other day. You're a nice girl. Go. Did you hear him? Everyone goes to college to study, but he doesn't want to study for free. He will never reform in this life. Children who were playing on the streets are all graduates now. Why can't he study? Do you know a human is? If a young man is offered a role in the movie, he will accept it instantly. If a young man is offered free education, no one comes forward. So, it is said that a donkey doesn't know the aroma of the kebabs. I understood. Why should we bother? There's a proverb saying... Why should... Why should we step into the knickers of strangers? Am I right? Why did you hit me? - Mosquito. There was a mosquito. Were you asleep? - No, I was dead. I returned to invite you for my funeral. I thought you were a good man, but you're like a monkey in cage. Puttu. Even the monkey's child is here. - Yes. Boss, you're doing justice with one and injustice to another. What you're doing is not good. You've called Ananth's daughter here. My wife will deliver a baby. Get him too. I will call everyone's children here. Do you think this as a kindergarten? Sleep. She has written a letter. She says she will deliver the baby in one week. You can read it yourself. Boss, read it. Why are you asking me to read? Don't you know I am an illiterate? He is an illiterate man. - Hey! I am an illiterate and it is a fact. Do you want me to get your child here? Come here. How many years will you stay here? Three years more. - Is it? Do this, tell them to cancel your punishment and send you to gallows. I will get your child here. Get lost! Idiot! No one hears my problem here. I want to die. 'No matter if 100 criminals are not punished,' 'but one innocent shouldn't get punished.' 'If I stay quiet, the child will become an orphan.' 'I know it is risky, but still I have to study' 'Ananth Ramaiah's case file and get him justice.' Sir, this is a very sensitive case. - I know. We both will land in trouble if we get caught. Yes. - Handle it carefully. Thank you. B A T, bat. B A T, bat. - Bat. C A K E, cake. C A K E, cake. - Cake. Birthday cake. Uncle, you read the spellings soon. I'll come and take a test. You have to score 100 marks, okay? - Okay. Dear, he can't take 100 as he has a habit of taking 90 ml. Shut up. Okay, you keep reading. I have some important work. You have to go out. Let's go. G A N G A, Ganja. That's not Ganja, it is Ganga. Shut up, idiot. G A N, gan. G A, Ja, Ganja. This is right. If you don't go from here, I will stab you to death. Get going. No boss, I will sit quietly. Everyone sit quietly. He is giving exam in an open university. You read. - A N D, and. M U C H, mooch. Annd Mooch. English is full of filthy words. I think that's the reason Gandhi drove away the British from here. Why are you laughing, idiot? I will stab you with this pencil. Why are you forcing him to read? What will he become after getting educated? He's so smart that he can become a scientist if he studies. Oh, what if he became a scientist? He can go to moon if he becomes a scientist. He can go to moon if he becomes a scientist. If he gets married he can go to honeymoon. What will he do on the moon alone? What is happening here? Ma'am, your student is useless. He will score zero in the test. - No. He will surely do well. Do you accept the challenge? - Yes. Uncle, you write. Pool. Pool, swimming pool. Pool. - Stay quiet. Pool. Foo... Yeah! Hey! Get going! Dad, don't do that. What happened to him? I didn't get a letter from home. Your wife may deliver anytime now. They'll inform you when she gives birth. No one understands me. I have no one. Uncle! Uncle! What is this? This is the phone without a wire. What do you call it as? It is called as mobile. It is new in the market. Is it original or duplicate? No uncle, this is original. Where did you find it? I borrowed it from my teacher. Dial the number. Uncle, it says there's no signal. Come, let's check there. Did you get it? Hello? Hey, talk softly or the inspector will come here. Jinke, keep the hand inside, the inspector will come here. Come here. It is ringing. - Talk to her. 'Hello?' - Hello. 'Hello?' 'Hello? Who are you?' Paro. 'It is you?' Hello? Hello? It is ringing. Hello? - 'Hello?' 'How are you?' - I am good. 'Kid and I are good.' 'He was born on Friday.' 'Did you deliver the baby?' 'Listen to the baby's voice.' 'I'm hearing my child's voice.' 'My baby.' 'I want to see my child.' Listen, how does my child look? 'Yes.' - How does his mouth look like? Small mouth. - 'He looks exactly like you.' Does he have all the fingers in his hand? 'Yes.' - And... What about his... 'It is not there.' 'I delivered a girl child.' Wow! He is inside the jail, now he has a child. 'What will we name our daughter as?' - Name. Ujala. Name her as Ujala. 'Okay, you come soon.' - Ujala. 'I will wait for you. Take care of your health.' - Ujala. You take care. You don't come out in cold. I will come. Hello? Hello? The phone turned off. Because of you, I could hear my child's voice. Plane. Aeroplane. Ananth, sir has submitted your case on re-trial. Bye! - Ananth. Ananth, stop. - Listen to him. The date of the trial is fixed. Are you ready to speak up the truth? I will tell everything. Now, I will wave at the aeroplane. Aeroplane! Hey, Ananth. Stop! When you saw her, the girl was lying in this position, right? Her leg was bent. My God! Will the person die if he fell like this? No, he would only hurt his elbow. So if someone falls down, he would hurt his elbow. - Yes, Boss. Then how did she injure her head? Boss, bag. Ananth, was she carrying bag on her back? Yes, school bag. Uncle! 'Puppy, do you want food?' 'I want food, I want everything.' 'Puddy...' My God! My head! My God! My God! She sustained head injury because of the bag. - When did it happen? On June 24th morning. She was going to school, it rained cats and dogs It rained cats and dogs on June 24th. We were playing volleyball on that day. We have played volleyball on several occasions. How do you remember the exact date? How can I forget that day? It rained on that day, I intentionally fell down several times, I went to first aid room, I romanced with nurse Mary. He went to the room to get medicated and walked out nude, are you talking about that day? It's slippery when it rains, she actually slipped and fell down. Correct. But how did she hurt her head? Ananth, where there bricks around her? There was brick in the spot where she fell. Was it a construction site or something? The shops were closed. On top of the shop, the brick... Didn't you understand? Ananth, you didn't rape or murder her, then why did you take off her clothes and kiss her. If you remove the clothes, the blood will circulate properly, if you give mouth and mouth respiration, the person will survive. How do you know that? The doctor taught me. You watched how first aid is done. Who will do it and show? I will. - Please come. What is the first step? Unbutton the shirt. - Okay. Correct. What is the next step? What is the next step? Mouth of mouth respiration. - Go ahead. Ma'am, what does he think he's doing? Okay, lay down. Cool. What is the next step? - Pinch. What if still the person doesn't regain consciousness? Slap him. He is such an idiot. He got punished for nothing. I will respond to it. Mr Manju, what were you doing? I run a travel agency. - That's your current occupation. What were you doing before that? Don't hesitate, tell you were a gangster. I object, Your Honor. An eyewitness is summoned to give testimony and not ask him what he used to do. He is trying to harass him mentally by asking unnecessary questions, Your Honor. It is necessary. Look, can you drink water in the bathroom because you're thirsty? You drink the water in the filter. Like it's important to know where the water is coming from, it is also important to know who is speaking the truth. Look Manju, you were a gangster. First of all, does your family trust you? Why do you say so? Don't underestimate me because I was a gangster. Even bad people have done good deeds. So what if the crow is black, the egg it lays is white. Correct, the color of the crow egg is white but the crow that comes out of the egg is also black. So that means, even if a criminal changes his attire he can never reform. Should we agree with what you say? Why not, sir. Will you let go the honey because the honeybee will bite? No, you don't. Since the color of the cow is black, won't you drink its milk? You drink, don't you? When the Kauravas harassed Draupadi Lord Krishna rescued her, even he was a butter thief. The whole world follows Bhawat Geeta which was written by him. So you are no exception. Look sir, suspecting everyone is not smartness, it's stupidity. When a criminal wants to reform, advise him and he will be grateful but don't underestimate him, he will revolt back. Look, I am going to benefit by lying, I am telling the truth. Several fake evidence has be created to prove an innocent as guilty and Puttu has all the evidence to prove them wrong, I am sorry, I have given it to ma'am. Thank you, sir. Do you have more eyewitness? There are, Your Honor. But that shouldn't worry the prosecution. The eyewitness has no criminal background. Jailor Agnihotri, who has performed his duty sincerely and has showed the right path to the criminals. Hello, sir. I am Neeraj Agnihotri, Himagiri Jailor. Himagiri Jailor. How is the guest sent by me? I hope you serve him bed coffee, breakfast, non vegetarian food during weekend? The criminals must've worked really hard before committing crime. So we must treat them well. What favor does he want from me? Sorry sir, I can understand your feelings. Though it is not under my authority, I request you on humanity basis. Can you please reinvestigate the case? Reinvestigate? But why? - Sir, I don't think Ananth Ramaiah killed the girl. Even I am psychology student. Seeing his behavior and innocence, definitely I can say he's innocent. - He is innocent? Then what about my daughter? You know what was her age when she was killed? You get impressed if someone bows down to you. You think of human rights only when criminals face problems. You won't understand my pain. Have you ever lost your loved ones? Yes, sir. I have lost my son. I understand the pain of the parents who lose their children. But I want truth to prevail, sir. Let me tell you again, Ananth Ramaiah is innocent. Enough, Mr Agnihotri. You're wasting my time, please. Sorry, sir. Did you kill the commissioner's daughter to seek revenge? She went, I followed her, I removed her clothes... - Stop it. Is that written in there? Dad, just memorize what he has written. The girl said, 'I will take you to the shop where toy plane is sold', so I followed her. Very good. - I am innocent. I am innocent. I am innocent. You removed the girl's clothes to medicate her. I removed the girl's clothes so that her blood circulates. - By the way, what did you go close the girl? I was trying to give mouth to mouth respiration. It is called cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Oh, my God. - It is called cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation. That's right. I am innocent. What will you do if you forget what you memorized in the court? I will say I forgot everything. Darn it. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation. You killed the girl with a brick. No, the girl was lying down, there was a brick beside her. Did you see the brick fall on the girl's head? No, I didn't. Lie that you saw. 'Truth is God.' 'Truth is everything.' Your honor, I am mentally retarded. The police hit me, they didn't investigate the case. They said they will buy a toy plane to Puttu, they said they will release me that's why I signed. It's a lie. I didn't do anything. I am innocent. Believe me. Wow! If you say this, the case will turn into your favor. Look, say this in the court, don't get scared, be brave. Don't bow to the society, else it will take advantage of you. If you retaliate, they will fear you. You will be able to survive only if you're brave. Look Ananth, God writes the way everyone in just one line but we have to write several lines in a day as to how to make a living. I swear by God, I was selfish till date but let me tell you something today, I pray that you be happy. Live happily with your daughter after you get released from jail. Don't worry, everything will be alright. You're smart. His intelligence fluctuates, one can't predict his thought process. Ananth, your lawyer is here, come. Come fast. I am sure you know why we are here. We are giving petition to grant minimal punishment to Ananth. Ananth, how are you? You're comfortable in the jail, aren't you? No, I want to get released. - Then listen to me carefully. You have a daughter named Puttalakshmi. She's my darling, she's a topper. The police will torture her. You know how the police are. - They are dangerous. The father of the deceased in police commissioner. He's the boss to the police. They will harm your daughter. - My God. So take the blame on yourself. - My God. I am innocent. I will tell only the truth. - Is that so? You will get released if you tell the truth but your daughter will die. I want Puttu to be happy. Very good. So will you save your life by saying you didn't kill the girl or will you save your daughter's life saying you killed the girl? Think about it. I want Puttu to be happy. Don't do anything to her. Stop. Shiva, remove the handcuffs. You know what to day in the court, don't you? What? They will kill you if you remain quiet. I don't mind dying, I am sad because I won't be able to live with Puttu. You want Puttu, don't you? - Yes, I do. So you must live. You have just one way, path of truth. If you die, nobody will be under loss, nothing is going to change. The child thinks you are her life, think about that child. I'll tell in the court as you instructed me. Very good. Everything will be fine. That's the spirit. I am confident that you'll surely win. All the best. Answer my question. Tell the truth to the judge. Then they will leave you. Answer my question. Will you save your life by lying in the court, or will you save your daughter's life by accepting to the crime? Answer my question. You have molested that girl. Am I right? You killed my daughter to avenge me. There are eyewitnesses, confess to your crime. Otherwise, I will have to kill your daughter myself. You molested the little girl and killed her with brick. Am I right? Speak up! I... It was I who killed the girl. Order! Ananth, what are you saying? Are you crazy? Yes, it was I who killed her. Your Honor, he is mentally unstable, he lacks intelligence. Lawyer, do something. Yes, it was I who killed her. You didn't kill anyone. - I did. Don't apologize because you're innocent. If you tell the truth, they will send you home. Listen to me, Ananth. The charges on the accused has been proved therefore, the appeal of the defendant has been rejected. The accused who committed such heinous crime is given dealt penalty. Buddy, what has he done? We trained him so well but he failed to speak before the judge. Doesn't he have basic sense? He does have basic sense. Something is fishy. I too feel the same. Forget the past. Think about the future. Look at him. Don't you feel pity? Ananth, time up, shall we go? Shall we go? Bye. 1! 2! 3! - 3! Bye, Dad. Greetings, sir. Sir, election has been announced. Both the parties are equally strong. That means the number of prisoners will increase. I have no idea about that but the date to put Ananth to gallows has been fixed. What do you mean? Date has been fixed to put Ananth to gallows. November 23rd. So soon? It's impossible. The law is being murdered at every step. Why did they fix such an early date for him? Several killers who were booked before Ananth are being treated well. What's the hurry to fix such early date for him? Boss, let's stage a protest. It won't work. We must do something. We must get him out of the jail at the earliest. 'I will do it. - I am the senior.' 'Move back!' 'Mic testing! 1! 2! 3!' 'Sorry to all of you' 'for the inconvenience caused. - That's alright.' 'The stage is all set' 'for dancer Sashikala.' Here it is! Dad! Aeroplane! - Dad, where are you going? Aeroplane! Dad, stop! - Aeroplane! Dad! Aeroplane! Bye! - Dad! Bye! - Dad! Everyone is watching, stop it. We are caught, Dad. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Thank you. - Happy birthday to you. Thank you. Dad. Dad, thank you. Wow! Aeroplane! Puttu, you received several gifts, are you happy? - I am very happy. But tell me which gift is the best? Who? The one that your father gave? No. - The one that your friends gave? No. The one who gave me the best gift is God. God? What gift did He give you? The best gift that God gave me is my father. Daddy is my best gift, best father, best friend. Dad, thanks very much for being my father. Ananth, you also say something. Puttu, you thanks very much for being my daughter. Dad, why is he crying? Nothing. Time to go up, they are bidding adieu. Time to go up, they are bidding adieu. I got to go. Aeroplane! Aeroplane! Thanks to all of you for being my friends. Puttu, thank all of them. Thank you. Love you all. I have now realized as to why Lord Krishna was born in jail. He knew that good people like you would be here. So God will bless all of you. Say bye. Bye. Bye. - Bye. Bye. Dad, where are they taking you? They are taking me to a huge palace. Huger than Mysore palace? A huge palace. Where is it? It's far away. I am going to the king of the palace. But will you stay alone? Yes, I will stay alone, I am not afraid. If you get scared, look at the sun, he is alone too but keeps shining all the time. You must also shine like him. It's Deepawali tomorrow. Happy Deepawali, Dad. Happy Deepawali! Happy Deepawali! Dad, when you were asleep the last time, I disturbed you by bursting crackers, didn't I? Shall I do the same even this time as well? If you do the same this time, I won't wake up at all. Challenge. - I won't wake up at all. I won't. Happy Deepawali! Ananth, time up. Shall we go? Nothing. Bye. - Bye. Bye. - Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. 1! 2! 3! 3! Bye, Dad! Bye! Bye! Bye! Everything will be alright. 1! 2! 3! 1! 2! 3! Dad! Dad! Dad! Puttu! Dad! I won't go anywhere leaving you. I won't go anywhere. Dad! Dad! Don't cry! Dad! Dad! I should fly once. Shouldn't I? Dad, let's go home. Sir, I am innocent. Dad! - Sir, I am innocent. Sir, I am innocent. Please. Please release my father. Please. Don't separate my daughter from me. Sir... I beg to you, sir. My daughter will become orphan. Sir, I am innocent. Believe me, sir. Believe me. Believe me. I am innocent! I am innocent! Puttu! I didn't reopen 20 years old case not to seek compensation because of the injustice that happened to my father. I want the society to know that my father was innocent because he is my biggest strength. You can conquer an empire if you have an army but if father is with you you gain the strength to conquer the entire world. For a man or a woman it is father who will be the first hero. The fear and the courage towards a father have so much power. The word 'father' is so powerful that if God appears before us and asks us what we want we don't ask for father's wealth, we ask for father. Do you know what the words were he spoke to me during the last moment of his death? 'Everything will be alright.' What a positive thinking! A person is never the same when he dies. But my father had the same childish behavior when he was dying too. He was never a bad person. I am proud that I am the daughter of such a father. As a lawyer, to prove that my father is innocent, I have produced all types of evidence to the court and hoping to get justice. Thank you, Your Honor. After examining the arguments and testimonies, what the court has learnt is Ananth Ramaiah who was convicted, the fact that he was mentally unstable was hidden, the postmortem report was tampered, false reports were fabricated, it is quite evident. As per the reports submitted to the court this time, since the death was unexpected, the court declares that Ananth Ramaiah as innocent.
