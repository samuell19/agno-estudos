[ Playing rock music ] [ Siren ] All right. That was great. Okay. Would you mind waiting outside, Megan? No, no. Great. Um, I ad-libbed in the middle because I couldn't read the chart-- I forgot my glasses. Oh. I'm just kidding. Oh. I really like the way that sampler sounds. We should clean it up with the drum pads next time. Yeah.it would sound really good. Okay. [ Snickering ] Huh? So, where did you find her? I didn't. She saw our note on the bulletin board. What do you think?No way. Don't sugarcoat it, Jeff. What do you really think? Guys, she's a replacement, and it's only for eight weeks. Man, for one thing, she's a chick. For another thing, it's like trying to replace Steve Perry from journey with Stevie nicks. Weak. Toby: Darrin, what do you think? I think her tush is a little big. You maggot. Look, I'm bookin' out of here in the morning. Toby, why did we wait so long? She's the only one that called. If you want to keep the gigs that we've lined up this summer, you need somebody on keyboards. Anyone. So, what's it gonna be? I'll take "things that won't fly" for fifty. How's that? Come on. All those in favor of making her part of the band, say aye. All those not in favor. [ Cymbal crashes ]Ta-da! The ayes have it. Joe, am I gonna see you at the golf tournament Sunday? Yeah, I look forward to it, Arthur. Make yourself a drink. No, thanks. I'm meeting Sarah for dinner. Good for her. It's about time you gave your wife a little attention. Don't let me keep you. [ Sighs ] Well... Okay, you're in. Really? I'm in? Oh, great! Practices are Saturdays at 4:00 and Tuesday nights. I work Saturdays. That's okay, they'll mess around with the schedule. Where do you work? Westside vet hospital. That's where I know you from. You're the flea bath girl! I came in a couple of weeks ago, and you said my dog had a funny name. The airedale. I came in with my little brother Trevor. That's right. I remember you. It's a small world. Nyee-nyee-nyee. Come on, guys. Let's get out of here. We're going to Westwood. You want to come with US? No, that's okay. Listen, we need you a lot more than you need US, so if I were you, I wouldn't take any grief from these guys. Okay? Come on. Joseph: I felt terrible lying to him. Sarah: Good. You deserve to. Arthur's been good to you. What was I supposed to say, "Arthur, I can't have drinks with you because our main competition is taking me to dinner, to make an offer"? When did all this come about? I thought you were happy with Arthur. Well, things change. Maybe it's time to move on. So, who approached who? They did. They called out of the blue. How was your day today? What's the tyrant up to? Toby? Acting like the sun is set and will rise no more. [ Trevor yells ] I gotta go. Trevor's got his tongue stuck to an ice tray. Have a good meeting. You're going to interlochen? My dad says it's a parent's obligation to send his kid away for training if he sees some talent. He just wants to get rid of you for the summer. National band camp, wow. Ever since your old man saw amadeus, he's been pushing carnegie hall straight down your throat. I mean, the kid's a rock 'n' roller. I can't believe you don't want to go. And miss all this wildness? Single! I am single tonight! You and me are going on a ride tonight! I'm single! Come on, baby! Come on, baby! The only reason why adults pull this authority crap is because they're afraid we're gonna outgrow them, and we already have. Yeah, but you're gonna learn some pretty heavy music. They teach a lot of cool stuff-- ear training, music theory. What good is that for? I don't know. Maybe keep you guys from singing off-pitch. I'm just saying you could use some help on your harmonies. I think you should tell your parents you don't want to go, bail on the whole program, and hide out at my place. Do the words "grounded for life" mean anything to you? Eight weeks out of your life isn't gonna kill you. Okay, you've talked me into it. Why don't yougo? Ha! Kellogg. [ Sighs ] I can't read my own scribbles. No problem at all. This is George suggs. Not much of a name, but one heck of a shortstop. Ballplayer, huh? Thank you. I hope you're here tonight with an open mind, Mr. Kellogg. You'll need it to fully appreciate the gravity of this conversation. What could possibly be grave about a job interview, gentlemen? Good evening, Mr. Cambridge. Good evening. Weinberg, wake up. [ Whistles ] Hey, lend me the jacket. [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Engine stalling ] Excuse me, señor, but do you own a gold BMW? The one you put a dent into? No, señor, the one that is on fire. How did that happen? I don't know. Felipe was driving. You better have a damn good reason for this. Cambridge just walked through the front door. What's going on?Get him out of here. The car's coming around now! Let go! Get his car! Go! I'm in. Where were you?! Three years' hard work almost wiped out-- he came out of nowhere, man. Watch the road! What do you want? I'm sorry it has to be this way. Who are you people? Justice department. Later.take it easy, Toby. Take it easy, bro.I'll see you, buddy. So, adios,tobias. I hope you have a lousy time. Don't get caught up in all that classical junk. Not a chance. Remember, it's a buyers' market for US stallions out there. Hey, listen. Go easy on Megan. It's not her fault she's a chick. Yeah, yeah. She's okay. Don't let this guy push you around. I won't. Have fun. I'll work really hard while you're gone so that when you get back we can play a heavy duet. All right. Bye. Bye. Have fun. [ Whispering ] A little late. Mm. Hi. You guys couldn't wait till I left till you started celebrating? I thought we agreed midnight was a reasonable curfew. What's this, a going-away party? There are some things around here that just don't concern you. Well, the things that do concern me I have no say in anyway, right? [ Joseph sighs ] Your bags are packed. We leave for the airport at 8:00 sharp. That's what I mean. Now that you mention it, dad, can we discuss-- not now. I got a lot on my mind. Well, when? Launch time is in t-minus-seven hours. When I want any backtalk, you'll be the first to know. I think it's time you went to bed. Don't you? Yeah. [ Horn beeping ] Yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming. Trevor, you have a package here. Come here! Look what we got! Hey, Toby, look what we got the dog. Nice. Listen, you goobers so much as walk past my room while I'm gone, I will know, and I won't hesitate in killing you both. All right? Bye. Get a move on. You don't want to miss your plane. Isn't the governor supposed to step in about now? He doesn't give pardons to crud. Hey, uh... Are you and dad okay? Yeah. We're fine. Bye.bye. You know, dad... If you force me to go through with this, I will not be held accountable for my actions. It's your last chance to redeem yourself before it's too late. Don't slam the trunk. I'll turn over a new leaf. Yeah? A new tree-- whatever works around here. I want you to know something. I know. It's all for my own good. I wish you'd stop being so good to me. A deal's a deal. But if you're not happy with the way things are run around here, you can always get a place by yourself when you get back. Chill out, pop. Get in the car. Go on. [ Engine starts ] [ Chattering ] What brings you to interlochen? The surf. The surf? What surf? We're on a lake. I was misinformed. [ Playing piano ] No. No. No. No! [ Cello playing ] You know what your problem is? Yeah. I'm in Michigan. Ow! I want to be here with these zoids only marginally more than I want to die of malaria. [ Playing tuba ] What you need is... A woman. [ Toby chuckles ] [ Telephone rings ] [ Ring ] Hello? Hi. Megan. It's Toby. Hi, how's it going? Lousy. Are the guys around? No, they went out to do some stuff. What's it been, a month already? Yeah, time flies. Are you having a good time with the band? Yeah. Thank you for putting me together with them. We are so hot now, you're not gonna recognize US when you get back. Do you want me to have Jeff call you? [ Sighs ] No, that's okay. [ Playing classical music ] [ Piano comes in late ] My score is marked "allegro." You have any idea what that means? Yeah. It's Italian for "stuff this, you little twerp." Toby: Listen, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to last five weeks until you guys get up here. How about it? How about you trying to behave yourself and learn something? We'll see you soon enough. Does that stuff go back to '72? Mm-hmm. Thank you. Toby: So, what's happening at home? Trevor's letter said things are getting weird. Excuse me. Well, for one thing, we're not gonna be able to get away. Got a lot of work to deal with here. What? You just said you were coming up. No, I said somebody's gonna come up next week. Who? I've got someone in my office right now. So, just hang in tough, okay? Yeah, okay. Bye-bye. [ Click, dial tone ] Joe, are we really working you this hard? Comes with the job, I guess. That's just what I want to talk to you about. I think this company's in pretty good shape. I have you to thank for that. Ahh. I've been keeping my eye on you lately. You've been treating me pretty fairly, Arthur. No, I've been selfish. I'm going to change all that. I'm going to... [ Chuckles ] Share the wealth. That's why I'd like to have you come out to the house this weekend. I have some friends coming to town, people that are good to know. Business friends? Very good ones. I'm sorry, I can't make it this weekend. That's a shame. Woman on intercom: Fred dobbins, line one. Says it's important. He says he's your realtor. Are you moving? Just thinking about it, that's all. If you need any help with your financing, [ chuckles ] Just let me know. I appreciate it. I really would like to have you meet my friends. I wish I could, but I'm sorry, I can't, Arthur. Yeah. Some other time perhaps. Yeah, thanks. [ Chattering, flute playing ] Hey, tobe. Hey, tobe! Yeah? Are you the only band in L.A. called bazooka? Yeah. You sure? Yeah. Why? News from home-- you're a hit. Hey, hey, hey. I hope you're not thinking what I hope you're not thinking. Want to bet? You can't just walk out. Watch me. Your parents are gonna hatch a brick. This place ain't cheap. So I'll pay 'em back. You'll never work in this town again. Don't tell anybody this, but I was starting to like this place. I'll see you at carnegie hall. Don't get caught. They'll never take me alive. See you later, David. "Escape from summer camp." Heh. I love it. [ Police radio chatter ] Has anyone seen Toby kellogg? Whoa. P.A.: Passengers arriving on flight 224 from Detroit may claim their baggage at carousel 4d. Toby: Hey. Got your message, bud. Welcome back. Hey, uh... Wanna explain this? We made the headlines, dude. "We"? You and who else? We were misquoted. I didn't even know the guy was a reporter. What are you so ticked off about? He could have said we stunk. That's not the point. I don't see my name here. Where do I fit in? What are you talking about? It's ourband, remember? It's even more yours than mine. So, where do you think you fit in? What about peppermint Patty? Megan's out.You're breaking my heart. Would you quit being such a bonehead? She worked her tail off because of you. She was afraid to let you down since you were the only one who wanted her in the first place. She's pretty good, isn't she? Yeah. Then why do you want to let her go? Idiot. Was it good a good flight? It wasn't bad. I'm gonna get creamed. Hey. You're a kid, you screwed up. How bad can it be? If they let me contact the outside world, I'll be in touch. Better not count on me going to that party tonight, bro. I wasn't.Take it easy. Later, bro.Thanks a lot. Guess who's home! Think... Think. Excuse me, Mr. Bauman. Hello, Toby. What can I do for you? I was wondering if I could use your phone. Ours isn't working. Not planning to call Hong Kong, are ya? Not today. Phone's in the kitchen, just inside there. Saw Jody out mowing the lawn a couple of days ago. You kids are growing up too damn fast. A couple of days ago? Recording: The number you have dialed is no longer in service, and there is no new number. Please make sure you were dialing correctly. Nice. Don't you think you and mom could have at least left a forwarding number? Woman on phone: Cambridge parks financial. Joseph kellogg, please. He's no longer with this company. Do you know where I can find him? Sorry, I don't. May I please speak to Mr. Cambridge? Woman on phone: Mr. Cambridge's office. May I speak to Mr. Cambridge? This is really important. I'm sorry. He's out of the office just now. Would you care to leave word? When will he be back? That I don't know, sir. Can I get a message to him? If you would like to leave word-- just tell him I'm looking for my father, and I'm going to Westwood, and I'll call him back later. Aren't you forgetting something? Uh... Oh. Thank you very much. Your name. Don't you think you ought to give me your name? Oh, yeah. Toby kellogg. Thank you. How are the folks doing? Haven't seen your dad much. What's he up to? I don't know. I just got home from camp, and while I was gone they moved. Moved? Where to? I don't know. Are you sure? The place is empty, Mr. Bauman, they're gone. The phone's been disconnected, the whole shot. You think parents ever wish they weren't...Parents? Sometimes? This is one of those things you hate to see. I wish I could say it didn't happen that often, but it does. I understand his grandparents are deceased. He can stay with me till this thing's resolved. I'm afraid it's not up to US. Don't worry, son. They'll find 'em. Where do we look first? It's not quite that simple. The law says I've got to place you in shelter care. What? It's a county-run agency. It's not bad. Give you a place to stay indefinitely until we find your folks. I can stay with a friend of mine. That's no problem. I'm sorry, son, but until we find your parents or you reach your 18th birthday-- that's a year from now. What if you don't find them? You can petition the court to become an emancipated minor. Excellent. Where do I do that? Of course, you do need your parents' signature for that. I don't make the rules. I just file the reports. All you've got to do is sit tight. Wanna bet? Hey! Hey! Get back here! Hey! Your mom really said, "wait till your father gets home"? Do you think your mom would mind if I hang low here till things cool down? My casa es su casa. Great. Excuse me. You know parents. Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em. Do I look buff, or what? Forget this, man. You can wear this, under one condition-- you do not mess it up. It is my favorite jacket. You mess it up, and you are toast. I'll be down in a minute. Don't tell 'em where you are. I'm always getting in trouble for getting you in trouble. I'll be in the Jeep. Hi, dad. David, it's me, Toby. You got trouble with a capital "t," and that rhymes with "p," and that stands for big problems. Tell me about it. Cops are all over this place. It's like dragnet. What did you tell 'em? Nothing. Good. Has anyone spoken to my parents? I don't know. Where are you? I'm back in L.A. What kind of story did you tell your parents? I haven't exactly talked to them yet. What's the matter, afraid to face the music? They put me on waivers, dude. What do you mean, waivers? I mean they're not here. They're gone. Split. Moved. Took a powder. Oh, man. It's a trip, let me tell ya. Maybe they just went on vacation. With the furniture? [ Party music playing ] [ Chattering ] [ Chanting ] Go, go, go, go, go... This is what I want for my birthday, right there. How you doing? You look great! How you doing, buddy? You're looking good. Everybody looks marvelous! Fred?yeah. Ready? Okay. Everyone take one of these. You want to take these and pass them down? The picture here is his last year's yearbook. There's a list of friends and hangouts-- you know, clubs, beaches, stores. Here, pass that down. Thompson, stay with US. You're all aware of the special circumstances involved here, and I apologize to you police officers for not bringing in your department sooner, but it's crucial that he be found quickly. Word on the street has it that the bounty hunters have gotten wind of this, so everybody works, okay? One more thing. Wait a minute. The boy isn't even aware of what his father's involved in, so you can go easy, okay? Whoo! What a shame! Why didn't they have parties like this when I was your age? You want to come in? Somebodyhas to chaperone this thing. Absolutely. Boy, talk about antisocial. If burmeister was my kid and this was my house... I'd beat the living crud out of her. You're home kind of early. I guess things didn't go too well at camp? Camp was okay. It's just here that's a little screwy. Listen, I'm sorry if you thought that I was overstepping my bounds. With the band, I mean. It wasn't what you think. Believe me, you're the least of my worries. No offense? None taken. Does that mean that you might still play a duet with me sometime? Oh, yeah. Right. You want something to drink? Sure. Toby? Yeah? Are you all right? Yeah. Why? Nothing. You guys ever hear of a kid named Toby kellogg? Yeah, Toby's a maniac. I've heard that. I need to talk to him, and I heard he moved. Do you know where he might have moved to, have you talked to him or seen him, anything? He moved? Where'd he move to? Come here, you guys! You gotta see this! Come on, come on, come on! TV: Tonight onnewswatch-- big business and the mob. Is the high stakes gamble of investment banking racked with corruption? Or is Arthur Cambridge and Cambridge parks fin-- [ channel changes ] Hey, turn that back. Get out! This is my room. Turn it back! [ Knock on door ] Open up, you little pencil-head! I get the guy a drink, and he disappears! Toby kellogg's here?What's it to you? Which one is he?The guy in the yellow jacket. Find him yourself. Hey, Darrin. Darrin. [ Girl giggling ] [ Door opens ] Take a picture, why don't ya? Toby: Let's split. I'm kind of busy. Fine. I'll walk home. Hey, man, what is your problem? It's a great party. I haven't had this much fun since I had the mumps. I suppose you'd have a better time listening to Beethoven. Maybe. Then why don't you just go back to camp, then, you little wuss? Here, Jeff. That was bright, man. Why don't you just get lost? You're not one of my favorite people right now, so why don't you just go cool off? I'll talk to you later. Think about it. Yeah, it's me. Stay put. There's somebody I think you might want to meet. Hey, hold up. This ought to cover it. Cover what? They're running out of beer in there. I buy, you fly. I'd like to help, but I've got to see if my friend's okay. All right, I'll go myself. Sorry. Are those your wheels? Well, I own the keys, I guess I own the car. I'll fly if you let me drive your car. So, I get to buy the beer and you get to steal my car. Just ride shotgun, and let me show you how to drive that thing. Can you catch? All right, man, I'm in! Move over, rover. All right, man. I hope I don't live to regret this. You won't. Just relax. [ Revs engine ]Whoo! [ Tires squeal ] Girl: What's going on? All right, listen up, everybody, we're looking for Toby kellogg. Toby's kind of popular tonight. What did he do? We're not at Liberty to discuss that. But I assure you he's in no trouble. Have you seen him? No. He was here a minute ago, but he went totally mental and left. Mind if I make a pit stop? I got all night. This is great. Make a left up here. Pull over. Perfect. Yes. Well?very impressive. Ooh! Man: You can't leverage a man you're never going to find. The next time you see kellogg, he's going to be on the witness stand. Not now. We've got his son. Jeff: You got a really nice pad here, pops. Freddy, would you get this young man a drink? Thanks. Tim, I'd like a word with you. Jeff: Just a soda, man. I'm driving. Any special reason why you wanted me to meet thisyoung man? The kellogg kid was at the party. I know it. Well, I suggest you find him. I never asked your name. Jeff. You're Tim, right? Yeah. That's a great jacket you got there. I was talking to a kid at the party who had that coat on. Yeah, Toby kellogg. But we got into a fight-- yeah, Toby. I promised him a ride in my car. Forget it. He took off a long time ago. Let's go find him. Forget it. The way he's acting, he'll be gone for a couple of days. I know who you are. I saw you on TV last night, right? Come on. Whoo. Take a look at that view. What are we doing out here? The party's back that way, and we didn't even get any beer. Come on. Isn't this something? Get out of the car. What are you doing, man? [ Jeff chuckles nervously ] Put that thing away. What is this, man? What did I do? Nothing. It's my fault. What is? Come on, the joke is over. Would you put that thing away? Don't worry about it, Jeff. You won't feel a thing, I promise. Come on, man, you're making me nervous here. Shh shh shh. Quiet. Just look at the view. Ha ha. It's beautiful, huh? Come on, man. Think about all of those people down there, and... And it's really no big deal. You know, kid... Life goes on. [ Siren ] [ Keyboards playing ] Don't stop. That was nice. The cops are looking for you. When? Darrin: They showed up at the party. They said that you weren't in any trouble, but they wouldn't tell US why they wanted you. Must be a federal offense to run away from camp. Where's ack? Good question. He hasn't even come home yet. Probably got lucky. I'm gonna bail. Me, too. I have to go to work in the morning. Don't go. No, really, I must. You meant her. What happened with you and Jeff? I was an ass. Seems like a growing trend in my character these days. Do you want to talk? My dad...Is a crook. What? He's part of the mob or something. This is a really big company. How do you know he's involved? Does it say? It's right here. "Police are still trying to locate several high-ranking corporate officers believed to be involved." My dad was in charge of all this stuff. Why don't you go home and ask him about it? There's nobody home. There's nobody home. They sent me 2,000 miles away... And then they split. That's why they sent me off to camp. You mean they're gone? They just ran away? The house is completely empty. There's nothing there. Boy, kind of takes the fun out of running away when they ditch you first. You're telling me. Maybe you should go talk to the police. No way. Don't be so paranoid. They said you weren't in trouble. Do you believe everything you hear? They're cops. And yes, I'm in trouble. They have me written up as a runaway. I know, but what about your family? What about 'em? They bailed. He's wanted by the police. But you don't know that. What are the police gonna do? Put a picture of my family on the side of a milk carton? Look, they don't want me... And I don't want them. I just don't think that they would abandon you. As far as kids go, you're not that bad. Oh, yeah? No. I don't think so. In fact, I think that you're kind of great. What do you know? Not much. You want to adopt me? Sure. No problem. Think your parents will mind? We won't tell 'em. Oops. Ah-ah-ah. I caught ya. I heard voices. I thought Jeff may be home by now. No. He's still at the party, I think. Well, I have to go to bed. Remind him that he has to get up early. We were thinking of going. Oh, yes, I can tell. Good night. [ Chuckles ] I really do have to go. Me, too. So, what are you gonna do? You can sleep on my couch at my house if you want. I think I'll just... Walk around a little. Where are you gonna go? Anywhere I want. No curfew tonight. Hi, mom, dad. I'm home. I know it's 4:00 in the morning. So I'm grounded. So what? [ Squeaking ] [ Door creaks open, footsteps ] [ Stairs creaking ] [ Engine revs, tires screech ] Help! Somebody help! Help! Look out! Couldn't let you have him, sport. [ Police radio chatter ] Man: They cordoned off all traffic all the way down... He was seen leaving the party with a guy in a red Ferrari. They were making a beer run. Who was the guy? Nobody knows. Just another spoiled college kid. Maybe this isn't even related. It was a red Ferrari that slammed into Morgan last night and put him in a coma. This kid is like a moving needle in a haystack. Or a moving target. All right, all right. He's just a kid, he's come home to an empty house-- if you were him, where would you be right now? Depends.on what? On if I'd looked over my shoulder and seen what's coming. So, who were they? I don't know. I didn't stick around to find out. I slept in the dugout near school with the rest of the homeless. Sorry. Some of these could use stitches. Now I know why my dog quakes with fear when he comes here. You're brutal. So don't dive through any more windows. So this is where my little brother gets all his stuff. Those glow-in-the-dark dog tags arrived the day I left. He was so psyched. Special tags for special dogs. A lot of people have airedales. But not with a name like yours has. I wonder if they took him with. Who, Trevor or the dog? Okay, that's good. You're all done. Yeah? Did I miss anything? No. I know that look. Puppies use it when they're trying to hide something. No, really, it's nothing. You sure you don't mind if I use your scooter? I just want to check out a couple of places and see what I can dig up. Maybe they didn't make such a clean getaway. Aah! Okay, drop 'em. Is this gonna sting? Like we tell the other patients, if you're gonna play with the big dogs, you're gonna have to learn how to pee in the tall grass. Ohh! [ Sighs ] Next. Would it be cool for me to check on someone's new address? It's a dollar for the search. Give me the name and address of the party you wish to locate. How about... Fifty-eight cents? Well, honey, you gotta pay for the things you want in this life. Next. [ Sighs ] Joseph kellogg. Nope. Nothing listed. What happens to all their mail? Goes back downtown, I guess. It just doesn't make sense. Lots of things around this place don't make sense. Maybe they don't want to be found. Next. [ Telephone rings ] [ Ring ] Answering machine: Greetings. This is Jeff. I'm not able to get to the phone right now. Just leave your name, number, and the time you called. I'll get back to you just as soon as possible. Ciao. [ Beep ] Toby on answering machine: Yo, Jeff. Where are you? I'm sorry about last night. I should have told you what was going on, but I couldn't. I mean, I'm a kid. I screwed up, right? So answer the phone. [ Sighs ] Damn it, Jeff. Why aren't you home? Megan: Dinkman. [ Telephone rings ] Vet hospital. May I help you? Have you heard from ackley? No. I thought you were gonna check in. Where have you been? Wherehaven't I been? Did you find out anything? Zippety-doo-dah. I can't talk right now. Meet me after work at heaven. Seven o'clock? Be there. Aloha. Hi, how ya doing? I was wondering if you could tell me who's selling that house back there. Are you in the market to buy some real estate? Maybe. My friend used to live there. I was just wondering where they moved. Can't help you. Couldn't you just give me their new address? No. How about a phone number? Sorry. Area code? Uh-uh. Well, you've done everything humanly possible. Thanks. Hey. [ Horn honks ] [ Honk honk ] [ Lively music playing ] Hi. I thought you'd never get here. Do you have any quarters? Yeah. Let's go.Where are we going? I got the number.Whose number? My parents. I stole it from this woman who's selling our house. [ Telephone rings ] Justice department. What's the matter? Boy, did I get the wrong number. [ Ring ] Justice department. We keep doing that and we're gonna go broke. Damn kids. [ Ring ] Hello. Toby: Hello? Yes? How can I help you? Who is this? This is Fred dobbins. Who's this? Why are you selling my father's house? Toby... Don't hang up! Who is this? Toby, don't hang up. Where are you? Toby, tell me where you are. Toby, tell me where you are! Got him. Toby! Think you can walk out of here quietly? Or would you rather end up like your friend up there in mtv land? We can do it either way. Toby: Megan, let's go! Come on! Megan! [ Ringing ] Dine and dash! Little jerk's skippin' his check! Get back here, buddy! Hey, get back here! Out of my way! Hey, man, mind your own business. This ismy business! [ Sirens blaring ] Man: Slow down, kid. [ Sirens ] Come on!No! Come on! Aah! Hey, kid! What are you doing?! Megan: Aah! Can you believe this? What are you doing here? Who are you? I'm doing my job, just like you, officers. How would you like it if somebody ditched a check at yourrestaurant? I'll get on the radio. Ow. Careful. Watch out. You have to go to the police. Jeff is dead. He would have killed you, too. Do you understand that? He was my best friend. Why did he have to kill him? I don't know. He was a brave kid. It's not always gonna feel like this. That guy is still out there, isn't he? Yeah. But we'll find him. I promise you. Where's Megan? We took her home. We told her as much as we could. And how is she? She's upset. She's gonna miss you. Hi, it's Fred dobbins. I've got somebody here who would like to speak to you. Hello? Hi, dad. Toby: Federal witness protection program? You guys really do that?Dobbins: Yep. Why couldn't you send US somewhere more happenin', like Hana or Maui? Luck of the draw. When does my father testify? It's not for a while yet. He's done US a tremendous service. Without him, our case goes right down the proverbial toilet. He's our link to how all of it was done. So, he's part of the mob, isn't he? Your dad's only mistake was looking the other way. It's understandable in his position. Why didn't he tell me anything? He knew you guys were coming to pick me up at camp. He didn't know at the time. He wasn't sure at that point whether or not he was gonna testify, so life had to be played out as usual until we could make arrangements. Might have aroused suspicion otherwise. Does it snow in Boston? Yeah, but look at it this way-- you get the celtics. [ Toby chuckles ] What'd you name the dog? Hmm? You said everyone had to have new names. What'd you name the dog? I only meant the humans. Of course, we could change it, if you want US to. Are you kidding? It's one of a kind. It's classic. Matter of fact, I think somebody took care of new tags. Your little brother was ready to take on the entire federal government. What is this one-of-a-kind name, anyway? Come here. As in "come here." Pretty clever, huh? Yeah, I think that is pretty damn clever. What's the matter? [ Chuckles ] [ Sniffles, clears throat ] P.A.: The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only. Dobbins: Next stop, Boston, mass. Toby: Some parade you got here. P.A.: The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only. Hey, sir! This is a no parking zone! Okay, gang, let's go. Toby will be here in an hour. Are we going to the airport? No. They'll let US go to a crowded shopping center, but they won't let US go to the airport. I don't care what they do as long as they get our kid back here in one piece. Come here, get in the car! Hey, trev, what did I tell you about that? That dog gets lost, no one's gonna know where he belongs! Mom, do I have to go? Sarah: Jody, honey, not today. Just get in the car. Where is everybody?What do you mean? Aren't there supposed to be a bunch of your guys around to protect me? What do you want, a parade? The idea is not to attract attention. It's just you and me, kid. Oh, I get it. No parade, but I still get the clown. P.A.: Will the representative from Boston tours please meet your party at baggage carousel 4. You want to tell me how to get to Dorchester heights? [ Clears throat ] [ Coughs ] First you get on the 294 east till you reach Dixie highway. Then you go south. It takes about 30 minutes, depending on traffic. Once you're on Dixie-- where are you going? It's 1540 greensboro drive. Well, the 1500 block is right around here. Okay, thanks. [ Speaking French over P.A.] P.A.: Flight 22 commuter service between Boston and nantucket is now ready for boarding at gate 2b. All set? Yeah. Can I hit the head first? Sure. [ Coughing ] P.A.: Arriving passenger Chris McKay, please pick up the white courtesy telephone. Hell of a flight, huh? I don't know about you, but I slept like a baby. [ Whispering ] Thanks, pal. That's him. That's him! Mr. Dobbins. Mr. Dobb-- aah. He knows where they are, doesn't he? Where is my family? Where's my family?! Man: That guy is robbing him! Hey, what-- woman: Oh, no! Man: Hey! Man: Stop that young punk! Stop him! Man: Call security! [ Telephone rings ] Justice. This guy just killed dobbins and he's gonna kill my family. Just hold on a second, slow down. Give me the information again. Who am I talking to?Toby kellogg. Dobbins was just murdered. This guy knows where my family lives and he's gonna kill 'em. Son, this sounds like a police matter. Let me connect you with the appropriate authorities. Dobbins was a federal marshal. You guys moved US here from L.A. my dad's gonna testify. You were supposed to be protecting him, only I don't even know where he lives. What's your father's name?Joseph kellogg. Dorchester heights! They're somewhere in Dorchester heights. Don't hang up. [ Snaps fingers ] Get the federal marshal's office in L.A. I need access to all protected witness security codes. It's 6:00 in the morning back there. The office won't be open for another hour. Do it! Now! All right, we're working on it, son. It's only gonna take a few minutes. That's too long! [ Ring ] Hello? Operator: I have a collect call from Toby. Will you accept the charges? Yeah, sure. Go ahead, please. Toby: Megan, I need your help. Where are you? Boston. Remember the dog tags that Trevor got, the ones that we talked about? Yeah, of course. Boston, is that where they moved you? Yeah. The company that makes 'em must know my new address. What's wrong? The guy that killed ackley, he's here. He's gonna kill my family, and I can't stop him unless I know where they live. I can't remember the name of the company. I'll go to the clinic. Call me back in ten minutes. Hey, the sign says full service. You want to check the oil, if it's not too much trouble? Okay, don't check it. Dorchester heights. Know where it is? Yeah, I know where it is. Start the car. Drive! [ Dog barking ] Radio: And this just in from our Metro news team. A passenger was stabbed to death this morning at Logan international airport. Eyewitnesses say the suspect, a teenage boy observed running from the scene, escaped in the confusion. The identity of the passenger has not been released. [ Tires screech ] Ooh! This is Dr. Kohnert's office in Los Angeles. You have a tag order from an owner in Boston, last name kellogg. Yes. We need the address right away. It's an emergency. But it has to be. There's nothing? Yes, the owner's name is kellogg-- I'm sorry, can you hold on a minute, please? No, we don't know the owner's name, but we do know the dog's name. Yes, it's come here. Could you please check that for me? Yes, two words. "Come here." [ Tires screech ] [ Telephone rings ] Come on, come on. [ Ring ] Hello? Yes. Yes, I will. Toby: Did you get it? Yeah, I did. It's 1540 greensboro drive. Phone number 555-3453. 3453. 555-345-- you're great! Ditto. [ Line rings ] Come on, answer the phone. Answer the phone. Come on! [ Ring ] Answer the phone. Ma'am, 1540 greensboro drive. Do you know where it is? I think it's-- no, let me see. Greensboro... Are you sure it's not greenfield? No, it's greensboro drive. This is an emergency. It's down about five blocks. Make two rights and a left. Thank you. Hey, yo, greensboro drive is down this way? [ Chuckling ] No, it's back that way. Gaah! [ Line rings ] I'm at 1540 greensboro drive. There's a huge fire here. Hurry! [ Horn honking ] [ Siren blaring ] Man: All right, let's go! Hey, kid! Get back here! Mom! Dad? Trevor? Man: Nothing on the north side! Is this your house?Yes. Do you know why anyone would call in a false alarm to this address? Good. I'd hate to arrest a nice kid like you for doing something stupid. Bring it home, boys. Man: All right, back up! Let's get out of here! Man: Haul it in! Let's go! Man: All right, let's haul it in! Wait! Wait! No! Get down! Toby! Whoa! Whoa! Aah! Ohh! No! [ Siren ] Toby! Hang on, kid! Come on, jump!We'll catch ya! Uhh! [ Police radio chatter ] Man: Johnson, call the coroner in! Hi. Dad, are you okay?I'm okay, kid. How are you doing? Are you all right? Yeah. It's over. Broadcaster: San Francisco's number one news at six. Newscaster: Nearly a year after his arrest, Arthur Cambridge is guilty-- so says a federal court judge. The crucial testimony was given by an unidentified source now protected by the federal witness program. Arthur Cambridge, head of a $2 billion financial empire, was convicted of laundering the drug profits of a major syndicate in the largest money laundering scheme to hit the southland in a decade. However, the troubles of Arthur Cambridge have just begun. He now stands trial for the murder of Jeff ackley, a 17-year-old Los Angeles youth who was the unfortunate victim of mistaken identity... [ Bell tolling ] You know... You look exactly like a friend of mine. You wouldn't happen to know a guy named Toby kellogg, would you? Never heard of him. I didn't think so. [ Sighs ] The jerk was supposed to meet me here, help me get settled. Hmm. What dorm are you in? Marks tower. Imagine that. You, too? I didn't catch your name. Megan Lawrence. What's yours? Greg. Well, it's nice to meet you, Greg. It's nice to meet you, too, Megan.
