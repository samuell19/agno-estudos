You Tube - Video Running Time 02:16:36 You Tube search name - Badal - 1951 The tyrant Jai Singh is going into the village. Who knows who will face trouble now? - Has everything come? - Yes, the money. Doctor, my father is very sick. You've come again? This isn't a charitable dispensary. You still haven't paid me for last time. I have the money. Take this. Run. I was a brave soldier but old age has taken away my strength. My illness has made me helpless. Please give us some more time. I beg of you. Get lost! Don't plead to him. You're expecting coolness from fire. Quiet! Or I'll cut your tongue. - Pay the tax. - Please have pity on us. Just think, where will we go if you throw us out of here? To hell. You've been given enough time. Empty this place or you'll be thrown out. Why not? Now you can do anything you want. If the King had been in the region... then you and your officers would never dare to talk like this. You're taking advantage of the circumstances. Do as you wish but remember that... my great grandfather was a soldier. And so were my grandfather and father. We've given our blood to protect this kingdom. You and your officers... Please forgive my son. Father! What's happened to you? The brave and valiant soldier died. Where are you going, Badal? I don't know. - Wait. - Where? Come. Drink this. Badal, the whole village shares your grief. But because of Jai Singh, no one can cry with you. Consider this as your own house. As long as I'm here, I won't fear Jai Singh. Lie down. Father... The world is changing... oh, the one shedding tears You hide these tears in your eyelashes My heart says to you... make these tears your weapon Wash away your pain with the light of hope In these dark times, light the lamps of your mind Now put aside your darkness. Morning will come again Seeing you, even my eyes have filled up with tears You change everything with the strength of your youth You must also change. This is the time to control yourself Who will stop you? Move like an arrow I'll play the music. You sing happy songs Where were you? I searched for you everywhere. Keep quiet. Okay. Why should I keep quiet? How the times have changed! You're asking your elder brother to keep quiet. - Keep quiet for God's sake. - I should keep quiet for God? What does God do for me that I should keep quiet? I will not. - He is very unhappy. - God is unhappy? You're wrong. God is not unhappy. God makes us unhappy. He is very happy. Badal is unhappy. - Our Badal? - Yes. - Where is he? - Over there. Maina, what happened to him? His father has been killed. His father has been killed. His father's been killed? And he's lying around like this? What can a poor man do? Yes, a poor man can't do anything. A poor man can do everything. He's a village youth. He can take his revenge. He can cut him into pieces. If he can't, then I'll go and take revenge. Give me my sword. Let it be. I'll take revenge. Let go. Tell me who killed him. I won't spare him. - Jai Singh. - What? Jai Singh? If anyone comes, tell them I'm not home. Brother, Badal has left. You're all made of mud. I'll shoot all of you. I'll lock all of you in the jail. - Who are you? A servant? - No, Sir. Who are you? What are you doing here? I'll burn you all alive. May I come inside? My Jai Singh. Ever since I've lost... they have ruined my life. I've become enslaved to them. Please call Ratna somehow. But I have come to tell you the day's proceedings. Very good. Come. - I have collected the tax. - Very good. - 500 gold coins. - Very good. Because of non-payment of taxes, I took over a few houses. Very good. Four men died in our kingdom today. - How? - Death came to them. Very good that death came to them. I have some need. - Very good. - Go. Is anyone there? - You? - Yes, I. Why have you come here? Over whose body have you laughed today? You can't save yourself from my hands. I served my father with these hands. I also lit his funeral pyre with these hands. And now I'll kill you with these hands. But you know that I am just the landowner's servant. It's my duty to obey his orders. And that's why you killed my father? You took away the pride of my ancestors. You made me homeless. I'll return your house to you. What do I do about the land that bears my father's blood on it. My heart is thirsting for revenge. I will never leave you. Your death will be life for humanity. Badal, everything in this house belongs to you. You can take with you whatever you want from here. - Gold and jewels. - Gold and jewels? Can you buy humanity with them? Can they bring back my dead father? Can your wealth give me a father's love? Can I get his playful scoldings? What happened, sir? Keep quiet! Or else I'll end up killing a coward. Take me to the secret door. What happened, sir? Open the door, sir. Open the door. Call your soldier inside. Follow him. The entire population is being ordered... that Badal Singh, son of Pratap Singh... by the orders of the Jagirdar... has been declared a traitor and rebel. That is why, whoever brings him... dead or alive before the court... will be given 100 gold coins as a reward. And whoever helps that traitor... will be severely punished by the Jagirdar. - Father, did you hear? - What's the matter? Badal has been declared a traitor. It's been announced that whoever catches him will be rewarded. He doesn't know there's no use trying to face the Jagirdar. God knows what we all will face this year. You still haven't paid your taxes. And you're sitting here and having a feast. Today we got a little rice after two days. And you call it a feast? - Keep quiet. - You keep quiet. Sir, this drought has killed us. Whatever little that grew, your men took away. - And we are... - Starving. So what can we do? - Take him away. - No, leave my father. - Move. - Daughter. - What's the matter? - Who are you? I live in the neighboring kingdom. I am his friend. - I borrowed money from uncle. - 2 gold coins. I've come to return that. How much does he owe? - 2 gold coins. - Very good. It's perfect. The tax is the same as the loan. Give it. Put it in your pocket. It's yours. He means that whatever belongs to us belongs to you. Sir, give us the receipt for that. Who are you? You saved my life. Uncle, a person doesn't do anything. God does everything. Yes. Jai Singh has offered a reward of 100 gold coins for my arrest. If you want, you can take it. - Call Jai Singh. - My son. Praises for Badal. Friends, praise justice. You're praising justice. But don't hesitate when being battered by injustice. Burn that country where there are no men that support justice. The people who look towards others to give them justice. You all know the Jagirdar is useless. Jai Singh has him in his control and is troubling poor people. This comes as no surprise. What's surprising is you tolerate it quietly. Your parents are killed in front of you and you keep quiet? They die from starvation and you're not affected? Your daughters are openly raped and you all watch quietly? Shame on your manhood! Or the flow of your blood! Rise and show the tyrant Jai Singh... that you all can protect yourselves. As long as the king does nothing, you face injustice strongly. From today, our fight begins... in the name of God and the King. From today, it is our duty to serve the poor and the aggrieved. Our duty is to serve the old and the young. Others' happiness is our happiness. Stand in front of this fire and take this promise... that as long as a single drop of blood remains in your body... you will fight against injustice. - You will die for it. - We will die for it. Praise for justice. Today my heart does not listen, it dances... in this spring weather See, the happy and nice clouds have come... and brought with them the wealth of happiness His coming has made the departure of grief My heart has been captured by his look I am here but my heart is with you Wherever the world might be, but you are with me My dreams do not listen anymore I am his but he doesn't know Is anyone listening? Where is everyone? - Yes, sir. - Where is Jai Singh? - He's gone out. - Then what will happen now? Don't you know, my daughter Ratna is coming today? See, her letter. Go and call soldiers and the army for her protection. Go and do it. You are all donkeys. - I know you very well. - Shameless, talk with respect. Shameless. All are shameless. No one is worthy. What rudeness is this? Who are you? I am the great Mahipal Singh. Don't scream. I know you very well. Shameless, talk with respect. Badal does not give respect to people like you. Yes, Badal. For whose arrest, you have offered a reward. But why have you come here? To empty this locker... into which you have put the sweat and blood of poor people. Open it. But, I don't have the keys. Don't lie. Open it. I'll open it. Come with me. This is the Jagirdar's carriage. Let's go and see. Greetings to you from Badal and his friends. What! You slapped me. Badal I have to tell you something interesting today. After hearing it, you'll know how brave I am. - Have you robbed someone? - We always do that. Today we kidnapped a girl. Are you mad? I was expecting you to call me mad. We kidnapped the Jagirdar's daughter. - The Jagirdar's daughter? - Or my father's daughter? Whether a girl is a Jagirdar's daughter or a laborer's... - a girl is a girl. - But her father is our enemy. Not the girl. Understand? It's the same. - Where is she? - 2nd number. - Yes. - You'll have to fight me. - Why? - So she thinks I rescued her from you. Understand? Come on. - Don't be scared. - Who are you? - I've come to take you. - Where? I've come to rescue you. Come on. Beware. If you try to touch the girl, I'll eat you alive. - Get out of my way. - I've moved. - I am Badal. - Who, Badal? You're spitting on Badal's name? Me... if I get angry, I'll break you into pieces. - Really? - Yes, come on. Coward, fighting with a sword. I don't have one. I'll get my sword and show you. Even I have a sword. Now you'll see. Wait. Badal, my foot. He took her. This is what happens when you're junior. You have to take beatings. Oh God. - Get on the horse. - By saving me... you've done me a favor I'll never forget. What favor? This was a simple job for me. What's your name? - My name is Baga. - Good. Now you sit on the horse and I'll walk. How is that possible? - So, you get up, too. - I get up with you? - Together? - Why, do you mind? I don't mind, but my horse does. Okay Baga, tell me. Who are you? Where do you live? Who am I? I am a wanderer, wandering everywhere No one knows how joyous I am This earth is my bed This wind is my sheet I am the daylight in the night This lightning shows me the way It takes me to my destination I've been brought up in the storms When I'm angry, I'm like fire When I'm happy, I'm like a note of music Away from the world, I'm different Maina, this is the Jagirdar's daughter. The poor girl was kidnapped by Badal. It was Baga Singh's courage that I rescued her from there. You go and leave her at the palace. Okay, I'll be right back. Baga, is this your wife? No, this is Maina. You'll have to come to the palace with me. And what if your father thinks I'm Badal? Absolutely not. I'll be there with you. Think about it. I've thought. Maina, you stay here. I'll go and deliver her. Shall we leave? When you're so prepared, why should I worry? You all call yourselves soldiers? You're all fools. Badal kidnapped Ratna in front of you all and you did nothing. You all deserve to be shot! - But, sir... - Keep quiet! You all can just brag and nothing else. I saw your bravery. Sir, your daughter has come. - Father! - My daughter. You've come? Why are you all standing here? Go from here. - Who are you? - This is Baga Singh. He rescued me from Badal. I'm very happy to meet you. He beat up Badal. I'm even more pleased after hearing that. You wait here. I'll be right back. I'm rewarding you for your bravery. Take it. Don't feel shy. You've saved my daughter's life. You've done me a big favor. - Take it. - Sir, I already live on what you've given. This also belongs to you. Saving her was my duty. Very good. Young men like you can banish the bad things from my region. Very good. Sir, now permit me to leave. I won't permit you. First tell me, how did you go there? And how did you free Ratna? I slipped and reached there and freed her with my nails. Very good. Yes father. After seeing him, they got scared and ran away. They ran away? But where can they run? Jai Singh will catch them. Then I shall take that Badal to the square and shoot him. You know, he secretly came into my room and... and stole my jewels. - What? - Yes. - Why are you laughing? - No reason. Please pardon me. - Permit me. - Yes, go. I've fallen in love with him I lost my heart. He lost his heart Two hearts have united You freed me from pain with an arrow You extinguished one fire by starting another one The two eyes met and the world changed The clever understood, but no one else No one else knows See the strange game played by nature There are no clouds but still it is raining You are still here, Baga? No, I lost something here. I'm looking for it. Why look in the sky? Look at the ground. That's the problem. You're very bad. May I come inside? I heard that you faced trouble on the way. - Yes. - I'm very sorry... that I wasn't there and couldn't help you. Thank you. That's not the thing. You don't know. At your word, I can make the sky and the earth one. I know and I also know that... your soldiers turned into scared cats seeing the dacoits... and ran away. It is good the brave youth over there came... or who knows what might have happened? How can I convince you. If you stay with me... then I can conquor the entire world. Enough. Now go from here. But I want to say something special to you. But I don't want to hear anything. Go from here. - It's strange. - Go away. Okay. Where are you, Baga? Far, very far, under this balcony. Stop joking. Okay madam. Here I come. But who was the one going to conquer the world? What can I say? That was Jai Singh. An evil man. He's kept my father in his hold. Actually, he's the one who rules. He wants to marry me. It is right. You are a princess... and he's a brave soldier. And I'm a wanderer of the jungles. Love does not differentiate between rich and poor. For love, both the palace and hut are the same. If you don't believe, then wait. Do you believe me now? But I'm scared. Our ship of love might break in my stormy life. I'll leave now. Please wait a little longer. I'll come again. Until then, keep this token with you. And think about me. What happened? The Jagirdar's soldiers are taking all the grain. Come on. Badal has come. Praises of Badal. - I won't leave you. - No, please forgive me. This was Jai Singh's order. This was Jai Singh's order! Why don't you say you enjoy persecuting poor people? If we don't obey him, then Jai Singh will kill us. It's better to die than do this. Don't do that. I promise never to do this again. This time I'll forgive you. If you do this again then you will pay. Come on. Run. I left my kingdom for six months... and all these rebels have taken root. Today he's robbed here. Tomorrow he'll rob everywhere. But why? Is the Jagirdar sleeping? - Yes, sir. - Write a stern order to the jagirdar... that if in a week this problem isn't solved... then I'll take that province under my rule. Yes, sir. What are you thinking? Nothing. The food is ready. Come and eat. You all eat. I'll be back. Nirula, did you learn anything? - Nothing. - Just no. No one could find out anything about Baga. Did you go to Maina's hut? Yes, but he wasn't there, either. If he's not there, then where has he gone? Go and search again. Please pardon me, but what has happened to you? You're always lost in misery. What can I say? I don't even know what's wrong. My heart... don't hide from me Tell the truth... about what has happened Let it be, my love What has happened has happened I counted stars all night I don't know when I fell asleep in your memory That dream was very beautiful... and I became totally lost in it Someone in my sleep became angry with me... robbed me and went away Don't leave your window open The thieves of love are on the prowl Many hearts have been looted... during the dark and beautiful nights For this illness of the heart... only the pain is the answer Don't make excuses Your secrets have been revealed Don't shy away from me Our eyes have met each other's eyes What's so bad if the heart is excited... and your home has been changed? Wait. I'll be back Don't go. Yes, father. What's the matter? You seem very worried. We are ruined, my dear. - What happened? - The king's order has come. If we don't arrest Badal in a week... he'll take stern action against us. What will happen now? Father, I have an idea. You got an idea? That Baga Singh who rescued me from Badal... he's very brave. He knows his den also. We'll arrest Badal through him. - You have said a good thing. - Okay. - But... - But what? - Where is Baga? Baga is here. I'll show you. Where are you Baga? He was just here, I don't know where he's gone. You must have been dreaming. How can Baga come here? No, it is true. I know his house. - I'll just go and call him. - Take Jai Singh with you. - You? - Yes. - Did Baga come here? - No. When he comes, tell him to meet me. We want to arrest Badal with Baga's help. You want to arrest Badal? - With Baga's help. - Yes, take me to him. You wait here. I'll look for him. Come back quickly. - Jai Singh! - Yes, me. Why have you come here? What better place to express my love for you? Don't try to cross your limits. Go away. I haven't come just to leave. What are you doing? Leave me. - Scream loudly. - Shameless man. I just feel scared of your eyes. Sorry, I came at the wrong time. I'll go. Save me from this evil man. He is just joking. - Sir... - Sir, my foot! I hope you aren't hurt. Who are you? - Yes, Badal. - No. This can't happen. This isn't true. It's true. I am Badal. Please don't touch me. Baga was brave but you're a coward. Baga was truthful but you're a deceiver. I loved Badal but I hate you. - Yes Badal. - No, this can't happen. - It's not true. - This is true. I am Badal. This is Badal. Don't touch me. Badal was brave but you are a coward. He was truthful but you're a deceiver. Come here quickly. Someone has tied up Jai Singh over here Badal, someone has tied Jai Singh to the tree over there. I tied him up. You take him away. Brother, please wake up. Who is it, who ran away? No one ran away. Where is Badal? At the Jagirdar's house. Why are you bothering me? Ratna is at our hut. She's looking for Badal. She must have come. What do we have to do? - Ratna is in our hut? - Yes. She's looking for Badal? Why? Thinking that Badal is Baga, the Jagirdar... wants to arrest Badal with his help. Say it once more. Thinking the Jagirdar is Baga, Badal... - No. - Wait. No, it isn't possible. Considering Baga to be Badal, the Jagirdar... No. Why are you counting again and again? If you don't understand then go to sleep. Princess... - What do you want? - Come with us. - Why? - Come. - Leave me. - Keep quiet. - Release me. Release me. You may go. What's the matter? Why have I been arrested? - What have I done - What have you done? You're that robber Badal's helper. You're also a traitor. You're accusing me of what the residents of this palace... have been doing for years? You loot our houses and kill us. Even after that, when your heart still doesn't rest... then you accuse us of being traitors and rebels. It's not a sin to call a blind man blind. I wish I had known earlier that Badal was disguised as Baga. Then you would have arrested and hanged him? Right? I praise your love. I don't love any rebel. Badal is neither rebel nor dacoit. He is a truthful man and... even the sun and moon verify for a truthful man. Your men threatened my father and took away his wealth. Badal had nothing to do with that. It is used against people who are looted by your father. - Maina! - The truth always hurts. We farm in harsh sunlight and raging rains. We nurture young saplings with our blood. When our sweat is repaid in the form of grain... you come and steal it. No, no, it's a lie. We haven't exploited anyone. We haven't punished anyone. This is the difference between the palaces of kings and our huts. Those living in palaces start screaming over small things. But those in huts consider tears as God's grace and bear it. Badal will rest after ending your tyranny. Because of your tyranny, his father died in front of his eyes. Maybe you don't know his father was a brave soldier. He served your kingdom all his life. And when old age took away his strength and he became ill... his son Badal started working to pay your taxes. And when the taxes couldn't be paid, Jai Singh came one day. Badal's old father pleaded on his knees. But the tyrant Jai Singh felt no pity. He just struck him down. The old man couldn't get up. Jai Singh took over his house and land. Poor Badal came out of that place with his father's body. His house and land were added to your wealth. But why didn't Badal tell me all this? Why didn't he tell me? I have committed an injustice against him. I'm a criminal. Maina, please take me to Badal. - Please. - There's no use meeting him now. Badal is a priceless gem and you didn't realize his value. You didn't appreciate him and lost him. I've lost Badal? No Maina. Please take me to Badal. I beg you. Take me. You're a woman. A woman can understand another woman's feelings. I wish you could also understand my feelings. So, do you also love him? Who doesn't love him? We're both children of the same earth... whose childhood is spent wrapped in dirt. Who always play with that earth. And when they grow up... they start loving in mother earth's lap. There is no roof except the sky. There is no clothing except shame on their bodies. But if you loved him, then why did he meet me? Because he felt happy after meeting you. I don't have what you have in you. You know how to talk sweetly. You know how to control him. And I know how to obey orders. I could never even tell about my love till today. My heart used to secretly worship him. And you used to speak and fulfill his love. Your love has words. And my love is silent. No, this can never happen. This will never happen. Maina, Badal is yours. And he will always belong to you. I promise you. Now you go home. Be happy. Always be blessed. Life is a fleeting moment Little do we know our journey's end Though my heart is filled with longing... where will I find another heart to love? One flower withers while another blossoms Some lose, others gain How can I complain against fate? Not every season is filled with color The light of dawn spreads across the sky Dawn spreads but darkness fills my heart My unhealed wounds cry out How can I find a way to blame the one who has wounded me? This smoke is coming from my burning heart My eyes are filled with tears Death alone will extinguish my grief Such is my sad predicament Where is Maina? Why don't you answer me? When your father and Jai Singh couldn't arrest me, you tried? And you arrested Maina? I never expected you to stoop so low. You anger is against me, not Maina. I have committed crimes, not Maina. You can arrest me but you have no right to punish Maina. If you think she'll be frightened by your punishment... and leave us, then you're wrong. She's no coward. Call your men and arrest me. Why don't you speak? Why is your mouth shut? Tears! Tears in those beautiful eyes? The Jagirdar's daughter was... fooled by a traitor and rebel? You're unhappy about that, aren't you? - Yes, father. - The king has sent a new order. He's asked me to go there. Who knows what will happen? We couldn't arrest Badal. In fact, he's captured Jai Singh. What will happen now? How will I face the king? If we don't arrest Badal, we'll have to give up this territory. Father, I can hand Badel over to you. - You? - Yes. - But there's a condition. - Condition? What is it? - He should be forgiven. - Forgiven? Badal should be forgiven? Have you gone crazy? I'm not mad. I'm saying the right thing. Until now, you and Jai Singh couldn't arrest Badal. And you'll never be able to. Forgiving Badal is the best thing for you, this kingdom and everyone. I believe even the King should be given this suggestion. Even the king should be given this suggestion? You've become totally mad. What will happen now? Before anyone sees you here, you must leave. Where is Maina? She left a long time before you came. She went away? I am very sorry. I thought wrongly of you. Spoke badly to you. Please forgive me. Please go from here. Badal, now you go from here. It's possible I've deceived you. I lied to you. But one thing is true. My love for you. You must leave. Badal, please go. But I'll come again and not go back alone. You'll have to come with me. Promise me. Yes. Now you go. Okay. Goodbye. Goodbye. My God, goodbye forever. And you can't dispense justice. Mahipal Singh, I can never tolerate this. If you can't run your territory then... I'll have to take it in my own hands. This time I myself will attack his den and arrest him. - Will you arrest him? - Yes, sir. And if you want, he can be pardoned also. That rebel who has taken the law into his hands? Are you mad? Even I told her that she has become mad. Who has gone mad? My daughter Ratna. It was her idea that the traitor be pardoned. So nowadays you follow the suggestions of women? No, sir. Forgive me. Just give me one more chance. Okay, I'll give you one chance more. I want peace in my kingdom. Jagirdar, remember that this is your last chance. Water. Please give me water. - I'm very thirsty. - I've brought water. Take. I'll give you, wait. Do you understand how it feels to trouble the poor people? Can you see how much fun it is? Badal has come. Now he'll give you water. Badal, please give me water. Ram Singh, bring water. Now do you realize what thirst means? What hunger is? - Badal, leave me. - I have intentionally tied you. So that you realize what those thousands of innocents... suffer when you hit them mercilessly. I've learned now, Badal. Let me go. I will leave you. But promise me that you'll behave decently from now on. Behave with humanity towards poor people. Before troubling them, you'll look at their helpless faces. Keep a hand on your heart and go back. I promise you, Badal. Please leave me. I'll leave you today. But remember, if you don't change your behavior... then I'll break you into pieces. - Yes. - Blindfold him and leave him outside the jungle. Father, what happened? Everything is spoiled. We're ruined. But what happened? The King gave me ten days more with a lot of difficulty. We'll become beggars if we can't catch Badal. We'll lose everything. - Did you ask about the pardon? - I did. You would have understood if you had been there. The King became very angry after hearing it. The idea about Badal's pardon is good. You! So did Badal leave you? Yes. The thought about pardoning Badal is very good. Do you really want Badal pardoned? Now I've seen him from very close. I think that this is the best way to stop this rebel. Did you hear? I said that Badal is a very good man. Please get him pardoned. Very good. If both of you want it, then I'll try to get him pardoned. I just want this rebellion to end in some way. I don't believe this. This is a ruse. When they couldn't arrest you... they invented this pardon plan. Even a 5 year old child is aware of his actions. Why are you silent? Why don't you speak? Because I feel this is right. The king made the declaration... and it's our duty to obey him. And what is our aim except this? Justice. If I have to go to the king to receive justice, then I'll go. But if I don't come back, then I'll tell you what to do. - Don't go. - What are you saying? You know I've decided. This is best for all. Please don't go. - Why? - How do I explain to you? My heart tells me this holds deceit. - Don't go. - These are your doubts. Don't worry. Everything will be alright. Badal, you've come? I'm very happy. Jai Singh, read the orders. The Jagirdar of Shaipur and the neighboring areas, Mahipal Singh... according to the wishes of the King... announces for Badal Singh, son of Pratap Singh... the order to be arrested. Father, was this your promise? Is this justice? Badal trusted you... and you betrayed him. God will never forgive you. Ratna, what are you saying? Aren't you ashamed to talk to your father like this? I wish I wasn't your daughter. Badal, take this. Take him away. Leave him. I tell you to leave him. - Go. - Father! Father, leave Badal. Or people will start hating the name of justice. The coming generations will spit on your name. Have pity on me. Please release Badal. Please forgive me, Badal. Priceless love is sold for free In the markets of this world... human beings and honesty are sold In this world, the buds of love get burned Desires remain in the hearts. The moonlit nights come to an end So many families get destroyed in this world We are robbed in broad daylight, also This heart filled with love is trampled under his feet The buds of my hopes dry in this weather I have seen the snake of sin nurtured by the milk of wealth In this upside-down world, I've seen the sun set in the morning Tell me God, is this the justice in your court? - Let me go. - I'm helpless, Princess. It means I'm a prisoner in my own palace. If you want, then something can be done. - Meaning? - Speak softly. I mean that maybe we can free Badal. Why do you want to free Badal? He saved my life once. I'll be grateful if I can do something for him. Please come inside. Will you tell me the name of your friends or not? You're such a fool, Jai Singh. You think I'd give the names of my brave friends... to a coward like you? I'll break all you bones. Even I could have done that, but I spared you. And now you're trying to be brave? You've killed so many innocent people. Today, you're scared of a common man like me. I might die after being whipped... but I will never betray my friends. I will kill you. You can kill me but not those thousands of people... who will continue to rebel against scoundrels like you. The people of the country are not such cowards. You can't quench the fire that has started in their hearts. We'll see. What punishment is Badal getting? Punishment? He'll be hanged. He'll just be hanged? Is there no other punishment? A rebel and traitor should get a bigger punishment than this. Very good. You are truly my daughter. Now do you understand how dangerous that Badal is? Yes father. Now I've come to understand Badal very well. I've heard the rogue isn't even naming his friends. That is the biggest problem. Problem. But father, I can solve this problem like this. - Like this. - Like this? - How? - See, father. What you can't learn by violence, can be learned by love. Badal has told me all the secrets of his life. You're right. - I'll go and ask him. - Wait, I'll come too. You're coming too? Yes, how can I let you meet that rogue alone? Okay. Put this away. Open the door. Jai Singh has given us strict orders not to let anyone go in. Father, are you the Jagirdar or is Jai Singh? You fool, am I the Jagirdar or is Jai Singh? I order you to open the door. No father. You wait here. If you go inside, he won't believe me. But how can I let you go alone? - He can go with me. - Okay. - What happened? - It was of no use. He doesn't listen to me. He doesn't trust me. Shameless. Close the door. Who opened the door? He escaped. What are you doing over here? Badal has run away. - Run away? - Yes, go quickly. There's a horse outside. Take it and ride away. But how can I leave you alone? Don't think about me. You run away. - He'll trouble you. - I'll manage. Save your own life. They're coming. You run away. Get on your horses. What happened to you? Cowards. Catch them. Very good, Badal's brave men. I ordered no one to go into the jail without permission. - Then how did he run away? - He just ran away. Should I say that you and the princess are involved in this plan? Maybe it's not wrong. Pardon me. But I'll have to inform the king about all these happenings. - What will happen then? - What will happen? He'll remove you from this palace onto the streets. No, Jai Singh. Don't tell the King. I can't show disloyalty to the king. What if I agree to marry you? Thank you. My daughter. Ratna, I've got the wedding clothes for you. Try them on to see if you like them. It's enough that you like them. I like them a lot, but you should decide. I'll see, but now I'm not feeling well. It's okay. I won't trouble you anymore. I'll leave the clothes there and leave. Try them on and see. My wedding clothes. This marriage veil. They'll make a good covering for my dead body. Badal, even the last breath of my body is just for you. These lips will become cold while taking your name. After I die, don't forget that... I tried very hard... to repent for my father's and Jai Singh's sins. But my wish remained unfulfilled. I am sure my God... will see that you always remain happy with Maina. I just have one request from you. That in the ups and downs of life... you think of me sometimes. - Did you call me? - Yes. Badal has become a legend. Those people couldn't capture him. He escaped from prison after being caught. Now I have to take matters into my own hands. I'll investigate it myself. But that won't be free from danger. I'm not scared of dangers. And then this will be my own way. I'll go there disguised as a tradesman. He won't recognize me. A few soldiers will be with me, who'll follow my orders. Your going between dacoits is like facing danger. If I have to face danger for my kingdom, I will do it. Go and make the arrangements. Beware. Throw away your weapons. Or you might have to lose your life. I have no weapons. I'm just a simple trader. What right do you have to trouble me like this? Who are you? Until provoked, even I'm a simple man. My name is Himmat. Who doesn't know me? Give me money and go on. - Who is your leader? - Right now, it's I. But actually it is Badal Singh. - Yes. - I want to meet your leader. You can meet him later. First give the money. - I'll only give it to him. - It doesn't make any difference. As you wish. Whether you go this way or that way... it's the same. This trader says that he'll only give the money to you... and no one else. - How much money is in this? - 10 gold coins. You seem to be a very weak trader. You're the first trader who's spoken the truth. I reward you half of the money for speaking the truth. What right do you have to rob like this? The same right with which you rob the poor. You rob them and fill your bags. I rob people like you and fill their stomachs. In the name of God and the King. The same King who lets robbers like you continue to flourish. And himself rests in his palace. Enough! If you say anything against the King, I'll pull out your tongue. So you think that your King is very nice? I don't only think, but I'm positive... that the day the pleas of the people reach his ears... he'll listen and come to our aid. If you have so much faith in your king... then why don't you plead to him? Why take the law into your hands? That's the regret. That we can't even see the King. Forget taking our plea to him. - Is that the case? - That is the case. Let it be. Come and have food with me. Whatever we have is before you. - What happened? - I can't eat this. It's food fit for animals. Do you think you're the king? Do you pass your lives with the help of this food? Man can't eat this. There are thousands who don't even get this. You can't eat this. But it's very important to poor people like us. But what do you do with the money you take? Want to see? Who are these people? Laborers who toil with their blood. They've been victims of Jai Singh's tyranny. - What happened? - Jai Singh took away my son for not working. There's been no news of him for seven days. There's nothing to eat at home. I went and pleaded at the Jagirdar's door. He didn't listen and his soldiers kicked me away. Badal, I don't know where my son is. Don't worry. I'll free your son. - Why are you here? - I cut a small tree. I paid for it also. But the Jagirdar's man came and said it was against the law. He started asking money from me. How could a poor man like me pay him money? He took away all my tools. And threatened me if I don't pay the money in three days... he'd put me in jail. You tell me what I should do. My children will starve. Don't worry. Be brave, everything will be alright. How is your mother? Jai Singh beat my father a lot. - I saw him. - Its okay. I will see. Badal, it is enough. Badal... Jai Singh's men are torturing us. They're taking away all our grain. - But you've paid taxes. - They take it anyway. Ratna's getting married. - Ratna, married? - Yes. But why are the poor farmers being troubled? Make the men ready and go with them. Come on. Happiness has been imprisoned Is this living any living? This wicked world... has taken the happiness of my life My heart is crying. Who should I call? What should I do? Living is difficult. Who should I call? What should I do? Fate has ruined me The sun of my life has set These waves of misfortune set in... and washed away my rays of hope Now my destination has gone far away These flowers are the thorns in my happiness They hide and cry secretly Death, you give witness... that I am sacrificing myself for love The world is a big killer When I die just do this much Come and cry two tears for me In the lost world of love... light a lamp in my memory You couldn't become mine Ratna, you are mine. I've come to take you. Badal, take me away. Far, very far. Where this palace and Jai Singh don't exist. Where there are no fights. Just the two of us. I'll take you. Come on. No Badal, this can't happen. This can't happen. I can't go with you. - Are you someone else's. - What are you saying? You belong to Maina. Maina loves you. She needs you and you need her. Don't talk crazy. Come quickly, I don't have time. Time is up and this time you can't run from here. This time I haven't come to run away. Move Ratna. Close the door. Catch him. Come forward. Today a dangerous criminal is standing before you all. He's a traitor and you're all aware of his crimes. That is why, in the name of God... the king and this country, I give this order... that Badal should be hanged. Badal, you run away! Praises for Badal. It's you? You've come to pay for my goodness? I behaved decently with you, gave you freedom. I treated you with respect, like a guest. Now you've come to arrest me? You ungrateful man! Take him to the scaffold. I'll go there on my own. Praises for the King. My lord. My people, you all must be surprised to see me here. But you all know that the first duty of the royal family has been... to maintain peace in the kingdom... and keep the subjects happy. When I heard that... Badal and his men were troubling people without reason... and the Jagirdar and Jai Singh were unable to stop them... I was forced to come here. You all know that rebelling against the rule is a crime. Badal is standing as a prisoner before you. You all decide his proper punishment. You are all silent. Then listen. I have investigated all of Badal's activities. I've also decided on the punishment for him. Badal, before I declare your punishment... you're given a chance to say something in your defense. Speak. You're also silent. Then I'll declare... that rebel Badal is pardoned. Praise to the king! And Jai Singh will have to come with me. I'll decide at court what to do about him. You just saw Badal slap his king in public. I deserved it. That king isn't a king... if he removes another's freedom without just cause. That king has no right to sit on the throne... in whose country rich men's palaces are built over poor peoples bodies. That king is a disgrace if, in the name of a king... the pleas of poor people... go unheard from the palace doors. I am proud of young men like Badal... who help the poor and helpless people. By saving them from atrocities, he has done something... I should have done myself. That's why I'm not just pardoning Badal... but from today I am awarding this region to Badal. My Lord, please forgive me. Arise, Badal. Tears in the eyes of a lion. Aren't you happy? Yes, these are tears of happiness. My fulfilled dreams are coming out in this form. Standing in front of my father's funeral pyre, I had taken a vow... that I'd avenge his death. Today after seeing me in my lord's arms... his soul must be feeling so pleased. Badal, I cannot bring your father back... but if you want, you can accept me. Badal, what do you want? You'll receive whatever you ask. My men should be pardoned. - Praise to the king. - Anything else? The taxes on the poor should be dismissed. Ask for more. My lord, I want your sword. - Why Badal? - You rule over us. But not with a sword, with love. It will happen. Don't you want anything for yourself? No, my Lord. Nothing. Badal, think once more. You still have a chance. Yes. Badal, Maina has been shot. Someone needs me, I have to go. You may go. Maina, you won and I lost.
