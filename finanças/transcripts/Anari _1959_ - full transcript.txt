Subtitle synced by Anomix33 Mrs. Disa. Good morning, Mrs. Disa. Good night. Good night, my foot! Come here! Where's the rent? You've a job now. No, Mrs. Disa. I got a job, but I lost it too. - I know. You must've played truant. - Not at all. I was sincere. Had I been insincere, I'd have paid you the rent. That'll be the day! I rue the day I took pity and took you in! Else, I was getting Rs.500/- deposit. But I refused. Understand? Thank God you refused that. Such people should be jailed! What! I should be jailed? I'll send you to jail, my boy. You don't give rent for 5 months, and talk of sending me to jail? No... Why should I want to send you to jail? I'll leave this place tomorrow. Oh sure! That's a nice way out. Run away without paying me! You're misunderstanding. That's not my intention, at all. I'll stay anywhere, but pay you when I get a proper job. Sure. If you try to run off, without paying me, I'll break your legs! Want to cheat me, eh? There is a letter for you. I had forgotten. I got it! I got it! What have you got? Why are you yelling? What else will I do? See this... I've got a job in a Hotel. - In the "Taj Mahal Hotel"... - No, in the "New" Taj Mahal Hotel. The old one is magnificent. Imagine, what the "New" one will be like! Didn't I say, that God was above everything and everybody? Yes. Now wash yourself, while I heat your dinner. No. I won't have my dinner. I don't give you rent. How can I eat off your table? Very smart, aren't you? You can then say... ...that since I don't feed you... you hold back my rent too! Don't try to be smart with me. Now hurry up and come. Don't try to be smart with me. Hey, you (village-bum) "Idiot". Yes. - Were you sleeping? - No, I was ironing my coat. Hurry up then. I'll just get you tea. Ok. Always stops at noon! Oh my God! It's alright... just a mouse. He came out of my pocket! But naturally! One can't expect an elephant, can one? I wish it was an elephant. That mouse made holes in my pocket! - Just your pocket? I wish he had... - Made a meal out of me, eh? Yes. At least it would end our daily argument! Days pass, Months end. But, my rent... What's burning in here? Oh no. My one and only coat got burnt! Not "got burnt", but "deliberately burnt"! - What? - Yes! I know your type very well. You thought, first the coat, then this house will catch fire. Then I'll go up in flames, and then, you'll find eternal peace! But hear this? I'm not going to let you off, yet! - Why're you sitting, staring at it? - Then should I stand? In fact I should just lie back! How can I go to work with this coat? Okay. Have your tea and come down. I'll give you David's coat. But don't you sell it! What a tenant! Give him a room; all the meals; even clothes! Everything free of cost! Oh Jesus. Help this boy. When I see him, I remember my own son, David. Mrs. Disa. - Give me the coat, I'm getting late. - Did you pray to God, David? Yes. But I'm not David. I know that! You're always fooling around. Now wear this. It's your Lord who's fooling around with me! He stamped me jobless and threw me in this merciless world! And then my parents joined him and named me 'Prince'!! And you look like one too, in my David's coat! What's that? Can't you even laugh properly, you idiot? If you wish to laugh... laugh with an open heart. Go on, laugh... No! No No... Never laugh loudly. You're all from rich families. You are here to learn all the etiquettes of the High Society. And for it, your parents are spending in thousands! You should be unique in everything. Just walk, will you? Good very good. Let's see you laugh. That's it. And will you sneeze... Aarti. Where is she? Put that shoe down, will you? Were you raining shoes then? - I just want to climb down. - Why, isn't there a gate? There is, but with a gate-keeper! Gate-keeper? Are you running away then? Please help me down. Excuse me, but I'm on my way to work. I can't afford to interfere in this. I'm also very poor, and I too have to go to work. And this is the way to go about it, eh? Actually, I used to work here. But I owe them a lot of money. Now they say, first pay us off and then leave. That's exactly what Mrs. Disa says! First pay the rent, and the vacate. - See how our stories match! - That's just what I mean! - How can I help you? - By becoming a horse! - Horse? - A horse! Yes, horse. - Oh. - Thank you very much. - No mention. You.. - Aren't you getting late for your job? Job. My God! - Hello! - Hello! Taxi! You're already back from college? - Ran away, you mean! - What for? Why did you run away? Answer me at least. That's no college. It's a mad-house! Shut up! Thank you. Do you know what they teach after charging us so much? Walk like this. Laugh, this way. No... Never guffaw like this. It's for the uncultured. Get it? - Anyway, any news from your mother? - She's better. Sent her any money? How much? I got Rs. 40 as my pay. I sent it all. Why only Rs. 40/? Why not more? You had my Rs. 500/ - with you. But how could I send your money? Why not? Listen I've told you before... You're not a servant here, but, a friend of mine; a sister even. Send another M.O. today, okay? - What's on your mind? - Presently, I just wonder... What uncle will say, when he comes to know that you've bunked! Uncle can never be cross with me. He loves me too much. But there's always a gate-keeper there, so how did you run away? Just ran off! A good Samaritan came by... He became my step-ladder, and I was out! - Who was he? - Some poor simple soul. He was on his way to work. Is your name Shahjehan, Sir? - What do you want? - This letter. So, you're "Prince", are you? - Just by name. - Am I the Emperor himself then? You'll get the job with Rs.30/ - as wages, and do all the work, okay? - Yes, okay. - Then come and take a look. Come. Come on in. Come. Ramu! He's our new manager. Show him what all he has to do. And you better take a good look too. Hey, there's a cockroach in this! Don't eat the curry, everyone. There's a cockroach in it! What nonsense! Where is it? Where is it? Tell me! In that curry there. See? - You couldn't just throw it, eh? - No sir... one must throw the lot! I see, I'll tell you who should be thrown... You both throw this guy out! - But see, Sir... - See what? Throw him out! Thinks himself to be righteous! Idiot! What's all this? Has that mouse got your tongue? I'm leaving. Today I went out for a few hours and.. ..you planned to run off in that time? It's not that. I'm just tired fighting off this unemployment. - What happened today? - What else? Today my destiny fell in the curry in shape of a cockroach! I told the clients, so I was fired! You're righteous with the world, but dishonest only with me! Not at all. Just think. Every morn dawns with a new hope. And by dusk, it goes out like a light! How long can a man fight this? And it'll be a gain to you too. You may get a better boarder. I know all that. You think about yourself first. What will you do? What shall I think? For the moment, I think I should go away from here. Very far. I'm like this clock here. Whatever the time... it's always 12 here. Everything wrong. Always. Where are you taking that? I've sold it. But it's incomplete. That I don't know. But I've taken Rs. 10 for it. Ten? But you sold them for just Rs.2-3 before. What have you to do with it? Take this fiver. I'll keep the other fiver as my rent. Mrs. Disa. I don't want an argument! To hell with jobs! Start painting; I'll sell them. You need to go out, take my cycle. And keep this for colours. Take it. No, I won't take it. It's your rent. I know. I know. You're no idiot, but a real rogue. You want to cheat me of Rs. 500/- with this Rs. 5/-. But I'm no fool either I've seen many like you! But I've not seen anyone like you, Mrs.Disa! "Like nightingales, let's sing the song of love." "If only I could find a companion today..." "..the earth would rejoice, so would the skies."

"If only I could find a companion today..." "..the earth would rejoice, so would the skies." - Can't you see properly? - Left your eyes back home? - You fool. How did you land here? - Let's go. Why waste time here? You? Yes. Is this your cycle? Yes, and if it hadn't been for them, I'd have been a corpse too! - But how did it happen? - Destined! After seeing you. I lost my job yesterday. I broke my cycle today. Anyway... don't feel bad please. I just jabber away. - Did you get the job? - Job? - Oh, yes I did. - Thank God. What's it like? That.. That girl there, wearing black trousers. - That. - Yes. She's my Mistress and I'm her companion. I mean, I've to stay with her. I see. - What's all that? - My painting material. - You paint? - Yes, I do. I left home to paint, and now, when I return, Mrs D'sa will paint me! Do one thing. Come home tomorrow. To paint Madam's portrait. What? You'll get good money. But I paint animals. Never mind. She's no different. - Do come tomorrow morning. - Where? 26 Nepensea Road. My God! She's coming over. I better go. Listen. What name do I ask? My name's Asha. Get up, Aarti... I've got the tea. Look outside. It's nearly noon. Come on, get up. - Your uncle's gone to office too. - So? I don't have to. Are you getting up, or do I douse you with tea? Why do you bug me! Aasha. - Yes? - Someone has come. - Who is it? - Some painter... Prince by name. Rajkumar. My God. It must be him. Ask him to come up and tell him Asha will be just coming. I had totally forgotten. - Undo your sari... - What the hell... Hurry up, We've no time. We'll exchange our clothes. - Why? - He's a poor painter. I thought I'd help him. Give him Rs 1,000 from my safe. But why change clothes? He thinks I'm Asha, and you are the rich girl Aarti. Get me? He's here to paint Aarti. No... I can't do it. For my sake... come on now. You've come? What are you looking at? A portrait. A portrait which I wanted to paint for years... ...is at last before my eyes! A portrait? Yes. I had some very fixed ideas about a portrait in my head. A very pretty girl, with long tresses cascading on her shoulders... ..and drops of water in her hair like dew on flowers. Eyes, as deep as the oceans. And a smile on the lips, that could invite death, or even give life. Why not let me paint you today? I can paint your Madam some other time. No, don't ever say that. - If she hears, it'll be hell. - Why? Doesn't she treat you well? She's treats me as servants are generally. - She's very short-tempered. - Really? Then I'll really fleece her! I don't pity the rich. - And one shouldn't also. Fleece her! - I'll demand Rs 20! What! Is it too much? - I'll reduce a couple, if you wish. - No... In fact, you should charge Rs 1,000! - Th... thousand? - Yes thousand. - Who'll give it to me? - I will. I mean she will. I'm a poor man, and you tease me so? See, I'm stuttering... - And my heart is hammering. - I'm serious. You must take a thousand. The richie-rich don't buy portraits, but false status. Come on. Listen! - Aarti! - Listen! Aarti! Coming... Not less than Rs 1,000. Remember. Listen to me... He's the artist. He's very famous, but I've got him to agree for just one thousand. - No... just twenty... - Ah yes. Twenty thousand. What he means is, that his first painting was sold for Rs 20,000. - So, where should Madam sit? - Anywhere. Okay then, come this way... Come right here. And you sit here. Have a seat... What's this? Are you making faces at me? Have you called me here to paint or to make fun of me? Why? - Your temper may be appreciated, but not in a painting. I can't do it. Then I don't want it either. Asha, come here! - Paint her portrait. - Mine? Yes. Don't argue with your mistress! Sit here and you paint. Carry on. Heavens! What a temper! You were right. But how do you bear it all? Beggars are not choosers! I don't have a father, and mother is ailing in our village. It's an old chronic ailment, which'll cost the earth to cure! That's why I took up this job. If I can't have her treated, at least she won't starve! Of course not. Just wait here. - Excuse me... - Yes? Listen. You can make faces at me, tease me... Whatever. - But let me paint you. - I said I'm not interested. You can paint Asha, however. You want money, right? Here's your one thousand. Go on, take it. Now go and paint her. What are you looking at? A thousand-rupee note? Yes. For the first time in my life. You have a look too... Go on. Keep it. Now, you needn't even do my portrait. No... that can never be. I shall definitely paint your portrait. But not today. I've some work today. Okay. From tomorrow, I shall come daily, at this time. Okay, bye. Listen... You keep this. Why? - Send it home. - No... no need to do that. Please keep it. You need it. Your mother's ill, isn't she? - I'll take that from madam. - Why do you want her to oblige you? And what about your obligation? Only the rich oblige. We poor can but help each other. Namaste. "Fall for a smile." "Share a grief." "Fall in love." "That's life for you." "Fall for a smile."

So, Raju... ..you seem happy today. - Yes, I am happy today. - I know why. You got money, right? I got a lot of money. One thousand rupees. Come here. - Why? - I said, come here. No... I'm not drunk. Honestly... I'm telling the truth. - I really got one thousand. - Hand it over then. Actually Mrs. Disa... - I said, give it to me! - I gave it to a girl. What? You're involved with a girl? I'm a poor lady... ..yet I refused a deposit. I starved but fed you! And you... She's even poorer than you. Very poor. Her mother's ill in her village. With an old chronic disease. I doubt whether she'll live... Now just think, Mrs D'sa... If you fall sick, and there is no chance of you surviving... So that's it! Trying to kill me, eh? - No... why should I do that? - Because I ask for the rent! But I tell you, I won't die! And even if I do die... My ghost will haunt you and take the rent! Then it's better we go together! - What did you say? - Nothing... I was just... Raju. Are you really telling the truth? Is her mother really so ill? Yes. Then eat out today. I'll be coming late. I've to go to my lawyer. What for? To throw you out of this house! You can throw me out of this house. It's made of bricks and cement. But who will throw me out of that house? That too of pure gold? Gold? Yes, Mrs D'sa. Your dear heart! Flattering me, eh? I don't have any heart... You old rascal. It's nearly nightfall, and you're still asleep? - Did you eat anything? - No... I'm not hungry today. I know! That girl's face must've satiated your hunger too! But do you have any money? Starve to death then! You got a good sum, but gave it away! A philanthropist! There's money here, and you lie to me! Tell me, you don't have any. - Where? What's this, if not money? - It wasn't there before. - It wasn't, eh? - Am I lying then? - Honestly, it wasn't there before. So, I'm lying, am I? - Really wasn't there before. - Oh god. What a tenant! He not only doesn't pay rent, but calls me a liar too! No. I won't keep you here anymore! I'll throw you out. But, Mrs. D'sa, listen to me.. - I don't want such a tenant. Hey! Want to die? If I do, it'll be my funeral. Why should you oblige me? Oblige you, my foot! I know all your tricks. Want compensation for broken bones! Just put on your car's lights. I've lost my P.50. - Lost P.50? - Yes. It was to buy me my dinner. Take this, and see where you're going. I'm unemployed. Not a beggar. I didn't mean it like that. You have to eat, haven't you? Join me for dinner, at my hotel. Thanks a lot. But why go in a car to a hotel, for a meal as alms? I can always sit and beg here. Take this. I found your P.50. coin. Really? This is made of nickel. Mine was of pure silver. Hey, your wallet's fallen... Your wallet... - Did you pick his pocket? - No. It had fallen from his coat. - Fallen? Liar! Come to the Police. - What for? Forget it. He's one of us. Give it to me. I'll give it to him. No. I'll give it myself. Where are you going. Hit him! Police! Thief!!! Thief! Mrs. Disa. It's not mine. I found it... that man... - Come with me... - Where? Come on, I say. - Listen to me at least. - I don't want to listen. Just come. - But what have I done? - I know what you've done. Now repeat with me. Oh Jesus. - I confess... - What? - Shut up. Just repeat what I say. - Forgive my crimes... - What crimes? - I'll never steal again. - I've not stolen it. Why don't you understand? I've not stolen anything. Forgive my soul. Today you've really broken my heart. - You stole today. - No, I didn't! I swear by Lord Jesus here. - You lie even in His presence? - I'm not lying... I'm not! I can deceive Him but not you. I can lie to Him, but not you. - Then whose purse is that? - I don't know whose it is. He dropped it and went to a hotel. And when I went to return it, the public beat me up! They called me a liar, and a pick-pocket! - No! - I'm not unhappy about that. I'm sad that you also called me a thief. You also don't believe me. It's not that, son... Greed of money makes man a devil. I thought you too were blinded by the temptation of money. Go! Go right this moment, and return the wallet to the man. Till you return, I won't eat, nor drink water even! Go! Where are you going? Go on... out! I don't care. Just get going! I don't want to see anything. Just go! Go in, Sir! What do you want? - Have a seat, please. - Ok. - There you are sir. - You? - Yes. I was looking for you only. - Looking for me? And what's this? You had dropped your wallet. I called out to you. But you didn't hear. Then some ruffians man-handled me to snatch this. They have my clothes... Anyway, forget it. You got this back. Right then, I'll go now. Listen. Sit down, will you? Sit. Do you know how much money this has? - Quite a lot, sir. - And you've come, to return it? Of course! Simpleton! I've been insulted due to this today.. ..and on top, you call me simpleton! Sit down... Go on, sit. See this kaleidoscopic world? Women dripping in gems... Men making loud noises... Who are they? I don't know. They are those who found lost wallets but never returned them! I don't need to know all this. - I beg you leave. - What do you do? - I'm unemployed. - Want a job? Will I get a job? Go to this address, and meet the manager. - Will I really get a job? - You've already got one! Thanks. - Will you eat something? - No... Somebody's awaiting me. - Wife? - I'm not married. - Your mother, then? - Yes, you can say that. Thank you very much. Has the sun risen from the west today? What's so special today? - Why are you getting decked-up? - For my portrait. - Portrait, or the artist? - Get lost! Uncle! What is it, dear? You're well, I hope. Yes. - No fever? - No. Why? You scared me! I'm seeing you awake for the first time! When I leave for office, you're asleep. When I return at night, you're still asleep. I've seen you grow only horizontally. I'm seeing you vertical today only! What can I do? You come so late. How long can one await? Okay; from this evening, come home early. Better distribute some sweet-meat. What for? Do as I say. I'm having breakfast with her, for the first time today! - Hurry, and get dressed.. - A meeting? Salute, sir. Sir, what are you doing? Work. You've done enough of it... Now you better pack up! - Why? What have I done? - Nothing. The whole staff stood-up in respect to the Boss.. ..and you kept on sitting? - But I was busy working. - That's what I'm saying. In today's world, saluting pays more than working! Salute anything that moves! I even salute my wife when I leave home. Sir, Boss has sent summons for you. Summons on a salvar for you! Forgive me if I've offended you. He was a nice guy. Pity he didn't know how to salute. No excuse whatsoever! I'm running a company; not a circus. Go collect your dues from the accountant. May I come in, sir? Yes, come in. Sit down. Know why I've summoned you? - To meet the accountant. - What for? Because I didn't salute you. - What has that to do with one's work? - That's what I say! Speak softly. Sit down. That's what I say. What has work got to do with saluting? You put in some more efforts, and next month you'll be promoted. - Thank you very much. I... - Carry on with you work. Listen... Yes. Take some money from the accountant.. ..and make yourself some decent clothes. Thank you, sir. So, what is to be? Going forthwith, or after a month's notice? Don't worry... you'll get some other job. But I already have one. - Where? - In this very company. The Boss said, if I work sincerely... ..I'll get better work and a promotion too. - Promotion? - Then you weren't fired? - No. - Very good! - Oh hell! There goes my tea even. You seem very edgy. Whom are you awaiting, eh? - Who is he? - Forget it. Let's go to movies. - You carry on. I've a headache. - Then you better see a doctor. Aarti. - Where? - Downstairs. - You just had a headache. - Let her go. The doctor's downstairs. So you've come now? Greetings. - I was waiting the whole day. - Really? Yes. I mean... for the portrait. Then I thought you won't come now. Impossible! I've taken an advance. And if you hadn't, you'd not have come? I would have too! I have a job now. So I'll come only at this time. Shall we go up? It's getting dark, and it'll be difficult to paint. It's all noisy up there; Madam's friends have come. And it'll be a mad-house soon! I see. Sorry. Was that a girl, or a boy? A girl. I thought it was a boy. See what I mean. We get such samples the whole day! - Any more such samples? - I feel like running away at times. - Let's go and sit in the park. - You'll go all alone? What... oh yes, I was about to tell her.. ..it's not safe for girls to go out alone. Okay then, give me a security-guard. - Do what you like! - I think you... - Are you coming, or not? - Okay... Come on then. - My God! - What? - Come with me... - Where? Come. - What is it? - Madam's uncle. So what? If her bark's bad... his bite is even worse! Come. I saved you, and you were trying to get me trapped! I wasn't myself today. Do you know how it feels to get a job after years? Of course I do. I don't have a government job either. I'm at the mercy of a rich girl's whims. I understand. No, you don't! Had you understood.. ..wouldn't you know why I wanted to come out with you? Why did you? - You're asking me that? - Yes. Idiot! - What? - Yes. idiot. - Say that again. - A fool! It sounds good when you say it.. ..anyone else, and I'd have broken his teeth. See that moon... so beautiful. Yes, so nice. It's full-moon, isn't it? Even the night is so young. But a little cool, eh? And see this flower? It's so lovely. I love wearing it in my hair. - Did you hear me? - Yes... so pretty. - I like wearing it in my hair. - Then wear it. "When the moon smiles and the stars laugh..." "..the night is filled with a strange ecstasy." "When the moon smiles and the stars laugh..." "..the night is filled with a strange ecstasy." "If you're smart, you know what that means."

The flu has reached Madras! - That's very far. - But God isn't! He sent it from Singapore to Madras... Bombay is even nearer. How many cases? 50? India has 35 crores... Why don't you think it this way? From 5 to 50... 50 to 5,000; 50,000, 50 lakhs... even 50 crores! No... God, I'm not greedy. I'm just a beggar at your door. - Did you call me, sir? - Yes. That medicine for 'flu... We'll have to manufacture it, in a greater bulk. - Then we'll have to have 3 shifts. - So go ahead. - But suppose there's no epidemic? - Here's another atheist! Why don't you do your job, instead of interfering in the Almighty's? Your job is to make medicines... God will see to the flu. Now go and do your work. Right then... No epidemic... I have some matches, do you have a cigarette? I don't smoke. Useless chap! Knows only work. Why work so much? Don't you know? Today's work tomorrow, and tomorrow's...the day after... What's your hurry, my dear son, when you know you'll live long? Actually my name means Staunch-worker... ..but in fact, I'm a Shirker! But don't tell anyone. - Stop working today at least. - Why? Today's the Autograph Day! - Autograph! - Yes. We give the Boss our autograph, and take the pay home! - We'll get our pay today? - Of course. Oh yes. Our pay-day. Mrs D'sa will be so happy! The Boss... Rajkumar. - From tomorrow, you work in the stores. - Yes. It's a responsible job, and do it well. Ok. - Mr. Kamdar. - Yes, sir. Was my file up-side-down? Then I've had it! That's why, do tomorrow's work today, and today's work just now. First time I'm hearing it! 8 plus 5 is 13. 13 plus 6 is 8. 8 and 9 is balance. - 13 + 6 = 19. - Really? What's the use now? Let us stick to 13 + 6 = 5 only. - Will you let go, or not? - Guess who am I? - The idiot! - Good guessing, Mrs D'sa. - What are you doing? - Catching frogs! Can't you see I'm cooking? Who'll eat this hash of yours everyday? What! I cook hash? If that's so, then eat out! I refuse to feed you. That's what I'm saying. We'll eat out today. Have you looted a bank? No, I got my first pay today. Really? Then give me my money. You're always talking of money! - Try affection too... - Shameless! Go to that girl for that! You've given her Rs 1,000! You talk of a thousand! I'll give you in lakhs! Here. My first pay. Keep it with you. Go to the temple and offer prayers there. Mrs. Disa. You're a Christian. And you believe in temples and Hindu prayers? Silly... All Gods are one. It's only man that sees Him in different forms. Your father sees you as a son. Your son sees you as a father. Your wife looks to you as a husband. But you are the same, aren't you? Yes. No! How can I be a husband? I'm not married... How can I have a kid? - I'll beat you now. - Sure, but you'll have to come out. - Listen.. - Come. Sit down here. Go on... - You're showing-off today. - And why not? I've got my pay today. I know. What are you doing in there? This is nice. - Wear this. - Who, me? How will I look? Old wine in a new bottle! So be it. I'll take you out like that. Come on, wear it. - Else, I'll put it on for you! - Okay... I'll wear it. - Will you wear it, or not? - How can I? With you standing here. David. From top to toe just like David. - Hurry up. I'm getting late. - Hold on... That's what's wrong with you girls. You waste half your life in dressing. And waste somebody else's half, in waiting for you. Come in now... - Wonderful! - What are you staring at? - What's this? - To ward off any evil-eye. Stupid! - Shut your eyes! - Why? - Just shut them! Okay. Here goes. Now open them. It's a cheap hat isn't it? But you know that... I can't afford... It's a cheap hat... Raju. My son! Boy! Not to scream like that in here. Say it softly, like this... Boy! Bring all the items that this money can buy! No... no only two dinners. Only two dinners. Have you gone mad? No, it's just that I'm so happy. - I lost my mother in my childhood... - So, you want to loot me! No, Mrs. D'sa. I don't want to rob you. I want to make you happy. Get married quickly, if you want to see me happy. Find some nice girl. I've already found such a girl. Did you find her, or vice-versa? - No. I found her! - My foot you found her! Where is she? I want to see her. Good evening ladies and gentleman. Today's dance is entitled... Music of Fashion And it's our wish that you all take part in it and dance.

Not there; come this side. What does you father do? Mrs. Disa.. She lost her father in her childhood. That's why she has to work. I meant when he was alive. What did he do? Go on, tell her. My father... furniture. Your father... furniture? She means a carpenter. - Feel embarrassed? - Why feel embarrassed? Jesus was a carpenter too. Hard work endears man to God! Absolutely right. - Can you cook? - So well, you'll lick your finger! You shut up, or I'll cut your tongue off! Come to the kitchen with me. - Ever eaten an omelette? - Yes. I eat it daily. I mean when I make it for Madam, I get the left-overs. She makes it beautifully. I've eaten it. Really? Today I'll eat it. Here. Make an omelette. Oh my! Where did you pick her up? She can't even break an egg! - She'll learn... - My foot! Didn't anyone tell you that all girls marry.. ..and become mothers some day? Just look at her fashion! Even an English lady will pale at it! Aasha. Aasha. Don't feel bad. She didn't mean it. Of course I did! I say what I mean. Mrs. Disa. Aasha. Hey you idiot. Where are you off to? Go upstairs! Upstairs, I said. Call Aarti too. - Isn't she up yet? - No. I'm still sleeping. What's all the get-up for? Every girl marries and becomes a mother. She should be able to keep a house and look after it too. - Meaning? - That even I don't know. When I asked the meaning, I got this as an answer! Now I'll have to worry about getting you married! But why do you need to work? You'll always live like a queen! After all, you'll marry a millionaire. Sure and he'll be just like you. Chasing money 24 hours! I'd rather marry some poor clerk! Nothing bad about the man. It's the poverty that is bad. This grinding stone grinds the human and humanity, both! This poverty itself had snatched your parents from me! That time I had no money. And today I cannot buy that time with all my millions! That's why I detest poverty! Wait! Hello. What! When? I'll be right over. - Have your breakfast... - No, this is urgent, I'll come early. - Did you hear what he said? - What? That poverty is terrible. He hates it. And he's poor... That artist of yours! Better you forget him, and that you both had ever met! What do you have in common? Different as chalk from cheese! - Still two minutes to go! - This watch is very slow. You heart is racing ahead. There was a time too, when I also thought all watches were slow. Couldn't wait for it to be 5 O'clock! And now I wish it never strikes 5 O'clock! But what will you do from tomorrow? We do over-time. - Over time. - Yes. Flu! And our employers say... By the grace of God, it will spread fast. Will the grace of God, spread it, or stop it from spreading? I think it spreads, because nowadays, God hears such prayers only. At times, He listens to the poor too. See, He heard your prayers. Okay then. Off you go. Okay, bye. Bye. Did you call me? Is the statement on that asthma medicine, ready? We can't find one carton of it! - What! I told you it's poison. If it gets mixed, with the flu medicine, it'll be hell! They not only look alike, but their packing is also alike! - Go and look. - Yes, Sir. - You, Sir? - Yes. And you, here? I come to see a girl here. - Girl? - Yes. She works here. And what about you? I've also come to see a girl here. Really? I know her very well. Yes. Do you know the owner of this house? No, Sir. He's a crazy character. - Really. Yes. He's always busy chasing money. I've not seen him around here. Come, I'll introduce you to Aasha. Come. - Let's go. Come. Come. Mr Verma had called to say, that the meeting is to be held tomorrow. Right. Make some tea now. - That means you are... - I'm that crazy character! Come. Excuse me. I said all that unknowingly. You didn't say anything wrong. It's the truth. Sit down now. Aasha. - Since when do you know Asha? - Past 2 months, Sir. Sit down. Only 2 months, eh? - Yes. Aasha. - What's happened? - Nothing as yet, but it will! Go take a look downstairs. What's going on around here? Sit tight, I'll be right back. Oh God! I've had it. He's coming up. Really? No use getting scared now. - Better come up with some idea! - Idea, my foot! It's all numb. - What are you whispering about? - Just discussing Mr Raj Kumar. - How do you know his name? - Well... Asha told me. And how does she know about him and his work, etc? No! Aarti... Don't be scared. He won't eat you. Tell him everything. Yes; why be scared? I like him too. He works in my company. - What happened? - Sorry. As I was saying, he's a decent, promising and loyal man. A good artist, and sings well too. - Really. - She told me. Feeling shy? Go on down. He's waiting for you. - Got caught today! - Sure... very clearly too! Any letters? Yes. It's in your room. Namste. - All's well, I hope. - Everything's topsy-turvy! - Why? What's the matter? - Get out of here, I'll tell you. I beg you. Go from here. - Where are you going, uncle? - To have tea downstairs. Join me. No. I feel shy to sit with strangers. Why feel shy at all? Come along. Okay. You go on, I'll just join you. Okay. You're leaving? Sit down, man. - Uncle. - What? - Your phone. - Who is it? Gave no name, but seems urgent. Please go from here. Why? You don't know. Uncle is very hot-tempered. No. He's very cheerful. Always smiling. That's just it. When he's smiling he's in a bad mood. Get up please... Whose phone was it? Nobody's replying! Sit down... - Sit. - Sit. - What's going on here? - He was leaving. How can he? I want to hear him sing. I believe he sings well. I can't sing. It's Asha who sings. Very well too! First time I'm hearing to it! - Where's the tea? - Tea? I'll get it, uncle. - Both got startled! - Yes. Now what? The cat will be out of the bag! - We must get rid of one of them. - But how? - I've got an idea! - Fall in a faint... go on. - What happened to her? - She has fainted. Tell uncle please. Sir, Asha's not well. Please come. What happened? She fainted suddenly. Hurry up. Fainted? Keep sitting. I'll just come. He's coming... you do like this... - What happened? - I don't know. She just fainted. - Pour cold water... - Get smelling-salts from upstairs. What are you staring at? Go get some milk. Heat it, too. - What happened to her? - God knows. She suddenly fainted. Go and see... Oh God! Get up. - What happened to her? - She just fainted... Go away, everyone... leave me alone. She wants to be left alone. Please go from here. I'll go away. Go away now... go away... Everyone is gone. - How is she now? - Very bad, Sir. You wait here. I'll just come. Uncle! You lie down now. How did her head change ends? Head? In her faint, she jumped from this end to the other. That means she's serious. I'll get a doctor. Rajkumar. She's very serious. Just come with me. Now I'll have to faint too! Egad! They've both fainted! My car's outside. Go get any doctor. I'll phone Dr. Sharma too. Aasha. I wanted to say this for ages... but I never got the nerve. Today I've got the nerve so I'll say it. Without you, every moment seems a day! And a day, a year! Aasha. I love you, dear. I love you! The moment she hears, she'll call me idiot! Suppose I put it this way... You're so late! I was scared. - Really? - Yes. You had fainted...yesterday; I nearly got blacked-out too. - And had I died? - It can never be! God can't be so cruel. He'll never snatch you from me. I want to say something for days now. But I just can't. Tell me. Without you, every moment seems a day, and each day, a year! I... - What is it? - Men say such things; not girls. I must say that. I was rehearsing for the last 2 hours, and you spoilt it! Okay. You say it. Aasha. Aasha "Between the heart and the eyes..." "..what passes?" "Will someone tell me the secret?" "From the bosom to my lips, what rises?" "Will someone tell me the secret of the song?" "Between the heart and the eyes..." "..what passes?" "Will someone tell me the secret?" "Between the heart and the eyes..." "I know not, why I'm being drawn." "What bonds tie me?" "I know not, why I'm being drawn." "What bonds tie me?" "Some I lose, some I win..." "What's the secret of it?" "Will someone tell me?" "Between the heart and the eyes..." "I'm lost... Is it the moon? Or is it a spell?" "Or is it the magic in your exotic eyes?" "I'm lost... Is it the moon? Or is it a spell?" "Or is it the magic in your exotic eyes?" "All that was mine, is yours." "What's the secret of it?" "Will someone tell me?" "Between the heart and the eyes..." "What are the skies trying to tell us?" "What makes the moon and the stars so joyous?" "What are the skies trying to tell us?" "What makes the moon and the stars so joyous?" "Why stranger, did you come into my heart?" "What's your secret?" "Will you please tell me?" "Between the heart and the eyes..." "..what passes?" "Will someone tell me the secret?" "Between the heart and the eyes..." I'll come to your place early tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Don't come tomorrow. - Why not? It's Madam's birthday. Good! I'll wish her and meet you too. Why should you come uninvited? You know her. May even ask you to go! So what if she's rich? We've our prestige too! Cool it. I won't come. But I'll certainly come to yours. Mine? - You'll never come on my birthday. - Why not? Of course I will. I'll dance, sing, and make you happy. We'll see. Now let's go. It's getting late. Yes. 25 lakhs crates of flu-medicine have been sent. We'll be able to make just 5 lakhs more in 3 days. It won't be enough. - So what do we do? - How about another machine? How can that be? Till we have a board-meeting how is that possible? Hold a meeting now, we'll fly in the machine. Today's Aarti's birthday. Her birthday will come every year... But this epidemic will not! It's come after 40 years! And the poor till die without the medicine. What are you doing? Hurry up and phone them. Rajkumar. Do me a favour. The cake which I've got for Aarti's birthday... Deliver it at my house; I'll be a bit late today. Happy birthday Ms. Aarti. - How come you're here? - Sir, sent this. He'll be late. Come with me. How funny. I'm saying this for your own good. So please don't mind. Go away from here. - What? - Yes. - Please don't mind. - Why should I? But can I meet Asha for a minute? No, not today. Please go now. Ok. Good evening everybody. - I troubled you for nothing. - No trouble sir. I've given the cake, so I'll go now. Where to? How can you go today? There's a party tonight. Come sit. Sit. Where's Aarti? She was here just now. I'll find her. Greetings. Greeting. How are you? Aarti has turned 20 today! This is what happens. See how witty her uncle is! Even the cake is heart-shaped! Yes. And look, someone's putting a knife into it! Didn't I say I'd come on your birthday? Aarti. Don't you know him, dear? He's Mr Raj Kumar. Of course she knows me. Good thing I sent you here. Didn't you say he sings well? Ask him to sing... Won't get a better chance. Go on, ask him. You... Of course I'll sing for your happiness. Good show! Ladies and gentleman. Mr Raj Kumar will now sing for us. He's not only a singer, but, a good painter too. He's expert at other things too, but for now, he'll just sing for us. Uncle, my friend here will dance to his song. Why not? Of course she will. - Right? - Sure. Today is the day to make merry. Then why wait? Go ahead. "I learnt all the tricks, but I never picked up cunning." "I learnt all the tricks, but I never picked up cunning." "It's true. I'm naive." "Life tried telling me so many times who's a lover, who's a stranger." "But I hid my wounds..." "to amuse you." "I have this death wish." "It's true. I'm naive." "I saw my heart being broken." "I saw love waning." "Every human, I found dying for money." "Those dying for love, will die like beggars." "It's true, I'm naive." "True faces and fakes, I've seen them all." "I've seen love held hostage." "Ask my poor heart..." "..what golden dreams I saw." "The star I coveted, fell from the skies." "I learnt all the tricks, but I never picked up cunning." "It's true, I'm naive." - Where is Raj Kumar? - He hasn't come as yet. Didn't come? - What is it my dear? - Nothing... nothing... You're here, are you? I looked everywhere for you. Come on, let's go home. No, you go on. I'm not coming. If you're not coming, I'm also not moving from here. I won't go home. Okay, let's go home. Change your clothes, while I heat the food. No, don't bother. I won't eat. What's the matter with you? - Nothing... - Then come and have food. - I said I won't eat... - And why not? - I can't answer your every why! - You'll have too! Please Mrs. Disa. - Leave me alone. - No! I won't leave you alone! You come and go as you wish... Well, it has to stop now! If that's how you feel, I'll go from here. Mrs. Disa. You've obliged me so much... neither can I forget, nor even re-pay. You're fighting this wide world all by yourself. I have a few rupees on me. Keep it... may come in handy. As long as I was with you, I made trouble for you. I could never make you happy. I'm one of those unfortunate ones.. ..who can give nothing but sorrow. Forgive me. You have a high temperature. So what's it to you? What difference does it make, if I live, or die? What am I to you? Don't touch me! You're misunderstanding me... Yes... I misunderstood you! Today, no son remains yours, because you want him to. And even if he does, he'll throw money on her face, and say... Here mom, the price of your milk! We're quits now! We're quits too! Now get out! And take these too. I don't want any damn thing of yours! Take them all away. Get lost! If a mother knew the sorrow of having a son, she'd never ask for a son. Nor there'd be any sons! Mother! - Mother. - Raju. Raju. No! I'll never leave you. Never. My son. - Never. - Raju. Hello. Who? Mr Raj Kumar? Somebody ill at home? Okay. Then come after two hours. Yes. Doctor. Doctor. - Catastrophe... Oh God! - What is it? That box of poison has gone with the medicines! - What? - Yes! When we checked... ..there was an extra box of medicines. And one less in the other one. Oh hell! Find out this minute, the whereabouts of that box! We tried our best, but to no avail. What now, Sir? Whoever takes those particular bottles, will choke to death! What do we do now? What? Look, not a word of this to anyone. I'm going to the Boss. We'll have to retrieve those bottles somehow! You're mad! Those bottles must've reached every corner of the nation! What do you expect? Should I advert that my bottles be returned? So that the public can throttle me? After this, who will buy our medicines? Do you want to ruin me? - Then what do we do now? - How do I know? Forget all about it! But suppose somebody dies? I'll be very sorry, but I am more worried about your future! If there's an iota of trouble due to this, you'll be responsible! - Sir. - You may go! Fool. - What is it, doctor? - She has the flu. I've prescribed medicines. And if need be, call me also. - Bye. - Bye. What are you ogling at? Haven't you seen her before? - How are you now? - Better. Please get these medicines. Won't you have your food? What shall I do? I can't even die leaving him thus. - I want to ask you something... - Yes? After me, will you tend to him? Why say such things? - I wish to hear it from you. Tell me. Now I'm not worried. He's as much a simpleton, as this world is shrewd! Give medicines of a reputed company. This company is very popular. Take its brand. Okay, give it to me. Mrs. Disa. What's wrong? What's happened? Nothing. I just felt faint. You better go home, dear. It's very late. I'm feeling sleepy too. Take her home. I'm going now... I'll come again tomorrow. May I ask you something? I'm a very poor man. And I've never tried to hurt anyone. - Then why this game with me? - It's not a game. If it had been so, would I be here? - Then why did you hide, that you... - Out of fear. I tried to tell you, but I couldn't. I was scared, I may lose you. Uncle knows about us; and he... I know. He has forbidden me from meeting you too! I thought it all out. If uncle doesn't agree to it... I'm sure Mrs D'Sa will bless us. - For me? - Yes, I can do anything for you. I can leave everything for you. Now go. Sit with Mrs D'Sa. Come, I'll leave you at the Taxi-stand. You're back, my dear? Uncle! Aren't you asleep yet? I wasn't feeling sleepy. I was reading a strange, horrible story. There was this rich girl, who loved a very poor boy. The girl was a beauty and the boy was young.. ..they've got carried away... ..and they married. But how long can man live on love alone? Slowly their love melted and hate took its place. The same hate that is felt by the rich, for the poor, and vice-versa. Those who were ready to give their lives for one another... ..were at each other's throats! With the result the boy took poison. And the girl returned to her old life.. It's not a must that every story should end like this. Meaning Mr Raj Kumar and yourself? - I suppose so... - What should I suppose? That you'll also force that man to take poison some day? - No... just love. - Love, my foot! Toying with his heart, kindling false hopes there; you call that love? I assure you, I shall find joy even in poverty. Shut up! Find joy in poverty, indeed! I had warned you, but even then you kept meeting each other on the sly. I've loved you more than my life ever since you were small. I won't hurt you in any way, but, and listen carefully. If you defy me, I'll ruin that man! Uncle. Yes. I mean it. I've not accepted defeat from anyone till today. I just feel sorry that your actions will make that poor man suffer. But you were poor too, once. Yes, that's why I don't want you both to taste that poison! If you love him, then become stoic. Don't be a fetter on his feet! I'm okay now. You go to the office. - No, I won't. - You won't? I'm not even dead yet, and you want to enjoy holidays? No! Who'll look after you? You're not to leave your bed even! Where will I go anyway? Aarti will come, and take care of me. You go now. I said go! Take this and sign here. Why did you come to make a will, when you're so ill? I'd have got it all done at home. - Mr. Patil. - Yes. Please sign here, as a witness. Now, whatever I own, will go to Raj Kumar. Yes Mrs. Disa. May I ask you something? You're giving everything to this man. You're a Christian, and he a Hindu. In what way is he related to you? In a very ancient way. Before any Christian and Hindu was even born! From that time. He's my son, and I'm his mother. Okay then, I'll go now. - Come, I'll reach you downstairs. - It's okay. You carry on. I'll go. Mrs. Disa. Doctor. I can't understand it! Why did she go out, when so weak? What can I do now? Give the same medicine, but double the dose. - Ok. - Bye. Why did you go to the lawyer in such a condition? To give notice! Notice... No need to threaten me! Get well, and I'll leave this house. Not your notice. But I've got one now. From up above! Leave it. I don't want to hear all that. Take your medicine. I won't take that! Then how will you get well? Come here. Open your mouth. Mrs. Disa. What happened? Nothing. What happens to you when you take this medicine? - Call Aarti. - I'm not going anywhere. - For my sake. - No. How can I trust you? I'll turn my back, and you'll go somewhere. I won't leave you and go. I'll stay here only. Mrs. Disa Go on, hurry up. It's very urgent. Call her here. - Why are you sitting in the dark? - Just like that. Raj Kumar is here to see you. - Shall I send him up? - No. Tell him I can't meet him. - Aarti. - Yes. Ask him to forget me. She said she can't meet you. Better you forget her. That's a lie. She can never say it. I'm not lying. She said she can't meet you, and that you're to forget her. It can't be! Aarti. Is it true that you don't wish to see me? Did you say, I'm to forget you? Yes. Uncle is right. We come from two different worlds. You can take our romance as a game, I played with you. Accept that and forget me. Forget you? How can I? My love is no game. It's my life. And my world. But my world is not that. This world of silver and gold... this world of laughter and joy... ..where life, is an eternal song of happiness. These diamonds, these pearls, these materialistic comforts... This is my world. - What are you saying? - What's right. Can you give me this? You can't. And if you can't, what right do you have to take it from me? No right at all. - Mrs D'sa wished to see you. - No. Give her my regards... Mrs. D'sa.. - Tell her that Aarti is dead, and better you think so too. And hate me. Go away... go away from here. I'm going. I've no place in this world of yours. There's a world beyond this richness and poverty. Where man is not weighed in silver and gold. It was there before, it's there now. And it'll be there, forever. "Leaving me..." "..leaving my heart broken." "You leave me heart-broken.." "Look..." "Look..." "..how my fortunes crash..." "..leaving me..." "Your sorrows, your joys." "My sorrows, my joys..." "..life flowed from you." "We swore a lifetime of togetherness..." "..it was only yesterday.." "Leaving me..." "..leaving me heart broken." "Look..." "Look how my fortunes crash." "Leaving me..." "At every moon-rise..." "I shall miss you..." "..and lie awake all nights..." "..sobbing..." "..when the heart is unwont..." "..how will I reason?" "Leaving me..." "..leaving me heart broken." "Look..." "Look, how my fortunes crash..." "..leaving me..." You didn't ask me why Aarti didn't come? She'll not come. Never! Said it was all a game. Mrs. Disa. Why does this world play games with me? Why does this... Mrs. Disa. No... no. You had promised you'd not go anywhere leaving me here. You can't play with me. I don't like this game... Please. I don't have anybody in the world. Don't leave me and go, Mother. Mother... don't leave me! Wake up; wake up, Mother. Rajkumar. Who can defy Death? Get up. That's just it. She was here yesterday. And there's nobody today. If she had to go, why did I make her suffer and force medicines on her? What was wrong with her? Flu. Flu. Which medicine were you giving? This one. From our own company. Whenever I gave it to her, she'd writhe in extreme pain. Said was it a medicine or poison... It looked as though, her chest... - What is it? - Nothing... nothing. There must be! Tell me. Not only this... After this flu, there'll be another wave coming... Much terrible than this... God is truly great, sir. That's fine, but I fell every worker should be given a double bonus. But of course, but hold on a little. With this new calamity, we're bound to lose some of our workers! Rajkumar! Very sorry to hear about Mrs D'sa. - She didn't die, sir. - What? - She was murdered! - Murdered? By who? You! Your company-made medicine, killed her! Now give another, that'll revive her. What nonsense! You are that kind, who can only kill, but not bring back. You're out of your senses. Go away from here. True! I'm really not myself. Else, why would I come here? Instead of going to the police? Rajukumar. Stop! Don't talk crap. You know very well, the dead cannot come back! But... The lips of the living can be sealed! Right? I don't want to hurt you in any way. But it's vital, to gauge the power of one's enemy too! I've an idea of it. And I also know... the punishment is the same, whether one kills one, or more! And you've taken one life, already! Astounding, sir! A mere worker... For God's sake, send your men, to collect... ..all our stock from the shops in his area. That we'll do of course, but suppose he tolls the bell, before that? Don't worry. Leave all that to me. Praise to the Lord. Yes, I've seen it myself. He was coming out of the police station. - So what do we do now? - Nothing. This is a huge city. Something is always happening... You could open the paper the day after, and read... ..that either he's arrested, or was squashed under a truck! Rajkumar! Rajkumar! You, and here? To see you. Now what do you want? Why have you locked-horns with Uncle? - Don't you know, he can... - Threatening me? You'll never understand. - I'll talk to Mrs D'sa... - Wait! Want to talk to her? Yes. Come with me. - Where are you taking me? - To Mrs D'sa. - But why should she be here? - Ask them that. This is a cemetery. Yes. And that's Mrs D'sa there! Now tell her what you have to say. No! No! When did this happen? When I had come to take you. How? Ask your uncle that! Ask him why she died? Ask him if her life was worth just a few rupees? - Meaning? - Ask him that too. Him, who sold poison as medicine; to make money. It'll come very handy when you get married soon. When you put henna on your hands then... ..don't forget there's Mrs D'sa's blood in it too! No! Mrs. Disa, did you see? She had come, and even wanted to talk to you. Wasn't it your last wish to meet her? But you... Are you Raj Kumar? - Yes. - We've a warrant on your name. Warrant. - What for? - Murder, of Mrs D'sa. Murder? Mrs. Disa. Come on. Aasha. - Come with me... - Where? - Come on. Uncle, give me some water, please. - I've to take my medicine. - What for? Flu. Of your company too. After hearing about Mrs D'sa, I had gone to see Raj Kumar. I had a bit of cold, so he gave me this. Don't take it! So he's innocent! It's made by your company. Which took care of her forever! Who told you this? It's a lie! Now, tell me he's guilty! That he killed Mrs D'sa. - You can't, can you? - I was helpless. Helpless! So helpless as to kill another, to save your own skin? No! But that was the only way! Else, I'd have had to see all my efforts over the years, ruined! All this style, this house, would have gone. Would you have liked it? No, Uncle. But at least this too, wouldn't have happened. What you were in my eyes just one minute ago! And now... And how I'm hating everything. I'm hating even myself. I didn't know, money made one so coward! Try to understand. What would you have done in my place? Before letting an innocent stand at the gallows... I'd have surrendered to the police! Okay. Police. Here, tell the police everything. Tell them he's innocent, and that I'm Mrs D'sa's murderer. No. Uncle! Aarti. Money doesn't make one coward...love does! I too wasn't a coward like this once! Look at him. It's the face of a terrible murderer! Don't go by his simple looks, but see the heartless killer behind it. A wretch, whose hands are stained, with the blood of an innocent. Your honour, whenever I've requested for a capital-punishment... I've felt uneasy. But today, I've no pang of guilt at all. If this stigma is not erased from the society, it'll only grow more! The deceased had nominated the accused, as her sole heir! Afraid that she may change her mind, and the will... the accused killed her on that very night. Poor soul! He had been obsessed with a girl. Mr Ramnath's niece, Aarti. After killing Mrs D'sa, he went to Mr Ramnath and said... You better get us married, else I'll go to the police. Mrs D'sa died due to your medicine. But had this been true, then... ..why wasn't another bottle of this poison, found in the thousands sold? He thought, Mr Ramnath would buckle under his threats. I request the court, yet again, The accused be punished very severely. As a lesson to others that no man has the right to kill a fellow-man! Now I shall present my witnesses. So this means, you met the accused, against your uncle's wishes. Yes. Had he taken you to Mrs D'sa's grave? He tried to brain wash you that your uncle is responsible for her death? - Yes. - He also gave you threats... ..that he would ruin your uncle? Yes, he did. One last question. Is it true, that you loved the accused? No! That's not true. I didn't love him; I still do! And that's why Mrs D'sa had to lose her life! That poison was given to her, by me! Your honour. More than my uncle, she was against us marrying. She never liked me, and I hated her for it. - That's why I killed her. - Lies! Total lies, your Honour! It's the truth! I know what he wants to prove. To save me, he wants to take the rap on himself. But I confess to it. I killed Mrs D'sa. Let this be recorded that the poison was given by this woman here. I requested the court that this be taken as a self-confessed crime. And I request the Court, that it should not be believed at all. His arrest has severely shocked her! And it looks us though she's lost her power to think, and understand. I request that she be treated Psychologically. I wish to say some thing. Don't be a fool! The Prosecution wants just that! For you to give a statement, so that he can blow you to pieces! But I don't want an innocent punished for somebody else's crime. - I wish to make a statement. - Granted. Holy smoke! She admits to the crime. That's not good, sir. The Prosecution says I should be hung. Well, yes. I should get the death-Penalty. I'm an idiot. People like me have no right to be here. Only those have a right to be here... who found lost wallets, and never returned them! This world is not for 'softies' but for the 'shrewd-shrews'! This starving, bickering world, where the lowliest... ..are put on the highest pedestal... This world of scavengers, where life begs. And dealers of death rule the roost. What was Mrs D'sa to me? A mother? A Hindu boy, with a Christian mother? How can it be so? I too request this court... That I be punished most severely. As a lesson to others... That there are such killers around, right in this court here. Whose hands are stained with blood, but the Law's arm cannot reach them. I want to tell them this... That this is not the Last court. Nor is this the final decision. How many Courts and decisions will they avoid and run away from? That's all I've to say. Very good! If the accused hadn't been a killer... ..he'd have been a good lawyer! How beautifully he has admitted his crime and pleaded not-guilty too! But how weak his case is, and how false are his statements... ..will be known tomorrow itself, when Mr Ramnath will be presented here. Aarti. Aarti. Where's she? - She's gone, uncle. - Gone? Where? That I don't know. But I know this. She'll never come back! She left you this letter. She was crying. Said uncle doesn't understand me, and vice-versa! But we're forced to live within these walls like some prisoners. Why didn't you go with her? I was going too. But she stopped me. Said, if I go, you'd be all alone. No! You can all leave. I don't want anybody here! If she can live without me I can live without her too! Get lost! - I was awaiting you. - Why? Who are you to me now? You had once said, you had never accepted defeat from anybody. Today, when an innocent, is sentenced to death... I want to see that glint of victory in your eyes! Really? Very good. Come with me then. Mr. Ramlal Is it a truth that when the culprit Rajkumar was hungry and unemployed. - Did you give the accused a job? - Yes, that is so. Did you have an animosity with Mrs D'sa then? Not at all. I first heard of her when he came to my office with a bottle. - Of medicine or poison? - Poison. You mean the poison was put in the bottle of medicine - Yes. - And that very poison killed her. Yes, that's a fact. That poison took her life, and made me a coward too. Meaning? Meaning that poison was made in my company. I knew about it, but I kept silent. Do you know what you're saying? Yes I do, and also its consequences. I knew then also. But my cowardice, forced me to keep my mouth shut! And even after all this, I've never accepted defeat, ever! I'm not accepting it even today! Especially from the fool! I admit that I'm responsible for Mrs D'sa's death. Me alone. You're leaving? Yes. But I had come here to stay. - To stay here? - Yes. I had promised Mrs D'sa.. ..that I'd look after you Said you're as much an idiot.. ..as this world is shrewd. "I learnt all the tricks, but I never picked up cunning." "It's true. I'm naive."
