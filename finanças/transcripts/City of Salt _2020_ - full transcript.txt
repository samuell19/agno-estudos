Hearing about this incident in the community it really triggered something in me and made me wanna reach out and give support to the community and give support for Theo's family. And to honor them and raise awareness about this issue that is going on since suicide is so prominent in Utah currently. And it's a very important issue that we need to bring awareness to. There are so many important topics on the news these days suicide, rape culture. How does this event fit into the direction you think Utah is going? Hopefully this will bring awareness but it's a shame that it took a politician's daughter to, for a change to make happen. . Hey folks. - Nice to meet you. - I'm Sheriff Pershing. - Thanks for coming so quick. - This is Deputy Nitrah. - Nice to meet you. - Thanks for calling us up even without the jurisdictional pushback. - Well we found evidence that may help to find the missing Doran girl so we're gonna do so by any means necessary. - This isn't about jurisdictions this is about a missing girl, maybe even the Doran girl. - Yeah, we appreciate the call. Now let's get our teams up here and get to work. Roger that mam. - Hey team it's Stanley, I need you up here. When? - Right now. - Incoming, keep it sterile. - Mrs. Doran. - Do you have her? - Mrs. Doran. - Do you have her? - Okay, my name is Detective Stanley, this is my partner Detective Hobbs. There may be some indication that Theo was up here as recently as today. Make a hole, I'm gonna take you what I brought you up here to show you. Thank you. - I need you to stay focused on me. This is, could be a little difficult. Please watch your step here. Did Theo give any indication that she was suicidal? - What? No, I mean no. She's a normal teenager. She had her moods and deep dark secrets and everything but you tell me what teenager doesn't. What about you sir? Every moment that passes is crucial. - There was an incident a couple of weeks ago. It was after the campaign party she, she told me that she was gay and then she-- - What? - Introduced me to her girlfriend. It was right after the guests left. She said, "There was something she needed to tell me, "something important and there was someone "she wanted me to meet." Who is this person that she wanted you to meet? - Look I don't see how any of this is relevant. Couldn't she have just run off? Kids do that all the time. Why would-- - We searched her backpack, sir, and we found this. - What is it? to do, how harsh this world . No, no, no, no, no, she would not do that. She's not like, she's got straight A's. - There's more. - She's perfect. - One of the hoodies was found drenched in blood and there's more blood that leads to the creek. - Tell her, tell her, goddamn you tell her who's this girl that she introduced you to. Who is she and why didn't you tell me I'm her mother? I needed to be there for you. You just, goddamn you, she's dead because of you. No. - Stay calm. to calm down. You do not tell me to calm down. Do you have kids? No. I'm her mother. - Hey, hey, hey. We are doing the best we can. - Let's grab you a warm blanket up there so you can regroup okay. - Mr. Doran, come with me. Let's go this way. Come on. Listen, tell me what I need to know or I will book you for obstruction. There's no winning here. You've got a decision to make either it gets out that you're impeding an investigation or your daughter is suicide, you choose. - I wanna talk to my lawyer. - Right. He wants his lawyer. Let's take him in for questioning. - Wait, wait, wait, just okay. Okay. Theo introduced me to her lover, her female lover. Some maid from next door I think. Pamela, I think was her name. I was shocked. It was right during my campaign party. - What did you say to her? - That I would rather die... or have her die than to have my daughter come out as gay. I screamed at Pamela about being hired help and that she was out of line and I banished them from ever seeing each other again. - I see. Look we've got another problem, this river runs westward underground for the next three miles. - What does that mean? - If someone fell in there's very little chance of recovering the body. - No. What? God this isn't happening. Oh my God. That's Theo's, that's Theo's hoodie. That's Theo's hoodie. No. I wouldn't have said it, I wouldn't have . Heavenly Father please no. Please, please Heavenly Father. - Are you sure about this? We can change our minds before it's too late. - We are better as friends. And we're practically roommates at this point and you know that. So let's not go in circles again. - Mary, Tia needs us both right now. Okay, this drug experimentation thing that she's doing it's not getting any better. What about our daughter? What about our temple sealing, our celestial marriage? - Fuck celestial marriage. I tried it your way and that still wasn't enough and I'm sick and tired of being a hallow shell popping antidepressants. It doesn't help you, it doesn't help our daughter, and especially not myself. I'm finally doing me for once and you know what? You're obviously not happy either. She was barely an adult Ken, what the hell are you thinking? You're sick. So just quit the facade for once. Okay. And embrace you, a man that loves younger woman. Go get her. - You know what? You will never understand. - I know this is a really sensitive time, do you need to take a step and go outside just take a moment. No. - We do have other customers here. - Sign the goddamn papers please. day until the last minute from all your past gimmicks - So they did it, huh. - Yeah, signed the papers yesterday. - I can't say I blame her. Your mom has too strong of a personality to be held down by his expectations. - We both know that he's got someone on the side. He does not hide behind that facade at all. Meanwhile my mom is stuck here. She's given up everything from her life just to appease their lifestyle. - We need to get her stoned man. And it can be worse than the shit she's already popping. Plus no side effects. It's practically legal now anyways. - Seriously, your dad'll be home in like an hour. Okay. You know I don't care about weed it's only thing that helps my arm after the accident but you dad is gonna have a knipshin if he comes home and smells this. Hi, Theo. - Your mom needs to get laid. - By someone who doesn't view her as a commodity for the afterlife. - I can't believe she got prom queen again. I mean maybe it's because of who her dad is. The votes were rigged. - Or maybe it's because she's a cool girl Dianna. Not everything's a conspiracy. - Yeah right. I'll bet her dad had a word with the committee or paid them off or something. - Uh-huh, let me guess, are you flat earthier now too? Ignorance is bliss Nicole, you belong with sheeple. - Whatever. - Ew, aren't you in the wrong bathroom? Shut up Shandra. - I heard that they like have their own special bathrooms now. - Why do you have to be such a bitch Shandra? I love you girl but damn is it that time of the month or this a delayed reaction from your walk of shame this morning? - I don't wanna talk about that right now. - Okay then. alone just like you - Hi. - Get a grip Theo, she's no one. Who's she gonna tell? - Hey honey your father-- - Mom get out. - Why what are you doing? - Get out! - Anything good? - Nah, the usual, liberals going crazy on Twitter and protesting that abortion law. They think they can just keep pushing, and pushing, and pushing. Hey Theo, how was school? - Hey Theo. - Theo. Why does she do that? - She's 17, that's what teenagers do. Oh come on. - What? I just can't even believe that. - What? - Touched my tattoos and now his whole career is ruined. I mean where are they gonna draw the line. - Okay, I get it, I do. But think of it this way. This movement is gonna help many without a voice to be able to have courage and stand up and come forward. Never underestimate the power of people in groups. - I mean you just watch if it's not this movement, it'll be another, and another, and another. People feed on drama. And besides people can change right? I mean look at Elder Justin he was leaning towards being gay and that camp took whatever was gay right out of him. - Okay says the ex-hippie punk rocker hallucinogenic addict who knocked me up out of wedlock. Really Will, you're gonna judge. - That just proves my point my dear, people can change for the better. - Okay so you are on edge and I blame the campaign. More hot coco dear? - Yes please. - You got it. - Ah, goddammit. What is, what is on the dog? Grandma crapped her pants again. - And then she smeared it on the dog again. - Oh dear God. Here. Hey love can you come get her for a sec. Yes love, I got this. - Thank you. - Hey Jane. - Hey love are you getting nervous? - You do not even know, I have been popping anti-anxiety pills like they're candy. - Okay settle down on that. Dear Lord, I may be your best friend but I'm about two seconds away from cussing you out. - I know, I know, it's just that, it helps to calm me down. Will has been more and more on edge the closer we get to the election. And Theo, Theo's the reason why I called you yesterday. She's been so, she's been more distant than ever and I can't reach her. I don't know what to do. I'm worried. - Just give her some space. Do you remember our hormones when we were her age? - No, but Theo, Theo's different. She's been spending a lot of time in her room and I mean a lot. And she screams at me, "Mom, get out!" And then she bolts into her closet like she didn't even want me to see her. - I don't know, all teenagers have secrets. She just, she's coming into her own. - Yeah, good point. - You know what you need? You need to come over and we need a girl's night. You need to relax and kick your feet up. - Heck yes. - Oh, you know what? We need to get Mary in on this. Did you hear, she signed the divorce papers like two days ago? - Yes, I heard. You know she could probably use some shoulders to cry on right now. And she could use a serious intervention. You know between the two of us we could probably get her off those antidepressant drugs. - Well I think right now what she really needs is just our support. - Good point. You're right. I love you Jane. Well have to look in that. We'll se what they can give us. - Right. Hey Ingrid, what have you got for us? - Hey guys. The forensic report came back the DNA blood evidence is definitely human and appears to be a match from the sample the father brought in from her hair brush. There's another thing though, someone else's blood was found on a hoodie and leading into the creek. Do you have any idea who that could be? - We've got no body. We have the hoodie leading into the creek. We've got the backpack with some personal items in it. We have a very distraught father who did not approve of his daughter's lifestyle. . - Hey, we're gonna head back to the crime scene, let us know if you find anything else. - Yeah, will do. - Thanks. Jay, what do you got? You don't wanna, you'll need years of therapy. - Okay, I need to see what you see. - It's not Afghanistan those shots were fired it's too messy for that. Whatever it is was well planned. But as it was happening it went south real quick. - What makes you say that? - They went old school, blades came out. Neither one are very skilled, you can tell by the angle of the splatter but either way they carved each other up pretty bad. - What do you make of these prints? Four sets, those two are the most active. - No body but we have enough blood for a murder. All right, don't say anything till we hear back from forensics. They'll make it official. - Come on in. Thank you mam. So what leads do you have, what have you found? - With all due respect mam everyone is working very diligently on this case. Now the DNA from Theo's hairbrush unfortunately matched the DNA we found on the hoodie at the scene. - What does that mean? What are you saying? What does that even mean? - I'm sorry. I know this is difficult but you have to stay calm. I can't imagine what you're going through right now but we are here to help. - Okay. - Continue. - Well, the DNA on Theo's hoodie is not only piece of evidence we found at the scene. There was someone else's blood and that's not all. There were footprints, two adult sized footprints and possible signs of a struggle. Mr. And Mrs. Doran, do you know of anyone who would want to harm your daughter or can you think, have you received any threats? - Has any one contacted you for a ransom? - Can you imagine, is there anyone who would want your daughter dead? - I don't know what you're saying. I don't understand. - Theo was at the top of her class. She was the most popular girl in school. She was the prom queen. Everybody loved our daughter. - Plus she was straight A student, all her teachers loved her and-- - Okay. - She participated-- - We are looking-- - In church activities and-- - Mam, we're looking at all possibilities at this point. This could be a potential case of corpus delicti, which is a possible murder. But we have no body. Every day that passes is crucial and we are working diligently but sir, considering your statements we're going to need to ask you to come to the station. We have more questions for you. I think we should go now. We'll see ourselves out. wraiths in these waters - Theo. - Do I know you? - No, I'm Max. Everybody knows you. I saw you yesterday. - What do you mean? - I saw you go into the bathroom looking one way and coming out completely changed. Don't worry I won't tell a soul but why do you care what people think? - It's not that simple. - Coming out really isn't that hard. I mean eventually they'll get over it or they don't but letting your spirit die is not good and snuffing out your true self it's toxic. Isn't worth it. before the dawn break into some kind of reef - Oh my God, you would think she has learned her lesson. Trash like you belong at rehabilitation camps or whatever they are. You transgender piece of shit! Go to some liberal state like Seattle. - Would you stop. She's not hurting anything or anyone. - Bull shit. She or he or whatever it is hurting this school by even being here. She makes me sick. Get out! Theo. Oh my God. - Please, please I-- - These are going to be online everywhere. Just wait prom queen my ass. Oh, looks like little Theo has some daddy issues to work out. This is going to destroy your dad. - Shandra let it go. - You are either with me or her bitch, you decide. - It's spoiled little girls like you that make it hard on all of us. If you ever tell anyone about this I, let's just say my dad knows people in high places. So you can either choose to let this get out through you and have him find out that way but if he does he will do everything he can to keep you quiet. Or you can let me come out on my own. On my own terms. And you can giggle, and laugh, and make fun . So choose. Wait. - Get a grip Theo. What have you become? - Would you just wait a minute. Are you okay? I'm Pamela, the maid next door. Why are you crying? Can I help? - It's just, it's just some stuff at school. - Let me guess, bullies. - I guess you could say that. - I see you come out of your house one way and back into your house this way and I can say with certainty that you're beautiful no matter what you decide to wear. I'm sorry that happened to you. - You've seen me before. Look I gotta go. I can't have my parents find me like this. - Like what upset? - Hey, where you going? - Not that it's any of you business now but Jane's having a fundraising event. - Okay, I just wanted to let you know that I'm almost packed up so I'll only be here for a couple more nights. I really appreciate how understanding you've been with this whole thing. You know usually people separate and then divorce not the other way around. So thanks. And you can keep our collection of vinyl. - You bet your ass I will. - Okay then. Well have a nice night, Mary. - You deserve so much better. You always have. Besides you're hot. And you know what they say 40's the new 30. Goddammit. - I just don't understand it, I sacrificed everything for him. I converted to the church, and I became housebroken, and I devoted myself to our eternal family. I still love the church with all my heart. I mean if it wasn't for the Relief Society , and nights like this with you ladies, I would be in a much different place right now. A place without community. - Well in all fairness, I feel the same way. Over the years after Will and converted there have been both good and bad things. Will became more of a father figure, more present in our lives. And he put our family and our empire above all else. But at the same time bits of his personality just faded. And now politics, I never would have thought, not in a million years. - And definitely not Republican. - Oh, don't even get me started. - Yeah, hey I don't judge, I certainly don't. And you guys were in love okay. You thought you were going in the direction that was best for you. Hindsight is always 20/20. Brody and I we certainly are perfect. In fact about an hour he wanted to ring my neck but we survive. - Cheers to that. - Yep. - Cheers. Yep that's why I drink a lot. It's not that much. I'm sober mostly. - I wanna show you something. I know we haven't know each other very long but I trust you. You see me for me. No one's ever seen this. I keep all of my thoughts in here and lately there's been a lot of them. Especially after the incident at school. These words are a piece of me. I always have leaves from this forest in here and twigs, and basically anything else sacred that you glue in with acrylic medium. I was brought up in the church but I never felt a connection to it. I've always felt a connection here in nature not in any church or temple. When I'm here the wind blows in my hair and my feet are grounded to the earth. And I feel one with the universe. In my mind anything is possible with this connection. I can impact my surroundings with my mind. It's nature, it's science. Can you feel it? - My family is from Brazil, my mother came here when I was just a baby. She'd tell me stories about the small village where we came from, the people believed in magic. They worshiped the mother goddess Yemọja and were also many other deities, like water spirits, land spirits, spirits of the people. Of course worshiping was very rare because Catholics made up the majority of our village but these spirits have always spoken to me. They live in everything. - Yes, that's exactly what I feel. I'm one with nature and all the spirits within it. - Sometimes my mother would speak of becoming one with the universe. There were legends that people would leave earthly and mortal realm and just disappear. - Where would they go? - They would become one with the cosmos, with nature and of the elements. - Has there been any news? - I have been instructed to bring you into the station for questioning. - What? How is that gonna possible help? Just do as you are told sir. Make it easier on yourself. - Jessica. Jess. - Go away. - Darling you need to snap out of it. Where's Will? - He's at the station I think. - You haven't been answering any of my calls. Have you eaten anything? Why does it smelled like something died in here? - Something did die in here, me. What if Theo is dead or has disappeared and gone forever? Whatever happened to her it's my fault. - What? - I wasn't there for her. I didn't know my own daughter and I missed all the signs. And now God has abandoned me, he's punishing me. - No. No, come on. That is garbage and you know it. Why don't we get yourself up, okay. And we will go do some investigating of our own. Maybe we can find out who Theo is. If she's in trouble then maybe it'll help us find her. - You're right. We can find her. And as long as I live I will believe that Heavenly Father will guide me. Where do we start? - I think we need to start in that deep forbidden room that all teenagers call their secret space, her room. - I haven't been in here since Theo disappeared. I just want her to be here. I can still smell her. It's her dirty laundry. It's like she never left. How can she be dead when I can still feel her like this. - No, she's not dead okay. We're gonna find her. Let's look around and let's see what we can find. - This was my mothers. Theo used to keep her childhood photos in here. Oh look at her. She's so little. What is that? - Theo's nature grimoire. Nature has variances and so do we. What difference does it make if male of female, white or black, Democrat or Republican. So why do I hide? Why so many surfaces that matter? Trapped in society's cruel chatter. Appearing to be something that I am really not inside. We have to keep going. We have to keep looking. - I think there's something here. It's a note. Just remember that no matter what they say you're beautiful to me in both of your ways. Both of your ways. What kind of cryptic crap is that? - I don't know but I think it's time for me to face the fact my daughter was living a double life. All right dude, thanks for spending the day with me. - Yeah, that's for the dress. It's looks so cute on you. It's gonna look great at your dad's campaign party. - Thanks. - It's nice to be home between deployments but my parents divorcing it's hard to be around. - When are you leaving again? End of the month. - I'm gonna miss you. Same kid, but you're gonna look great in this dress. - Thanks. - Have fun. - I won't. Listen we're just trying to find his daughter, any information he could give us could potentially help. - He is under no obligation to answer as he is not a suspect. - And as long as he tells the truth we have no reason to question him otherwise. - Tell me what happened two weeks ago when your daughter told you her secret? - Okay. It all started with my campaign party. It was the talk of the town. All the elites, everyone was there, the governor, the senators, the mayor. And my wife Jessica had meticulously prepared the event. Torches were lite outside, spiced wassail was pouring, the fireplace was beaming with a strong fire, ambiance was perfect. I had a strong following in the preliminary races and it showed. - I'd like to make a toast to the most family valuing genuine fiscally responsible candidate I've seen since our own governor. Leading this race by a landslide already I can't wait to see what he's going to do for our good state of Utah. We will not be lead astray. Let's keep this best kept secret, our unique Salt Lake City a secret shall we for this is a place unlike any other. - Here, here and I toast the man of the hour William Doran, the future senator of our great state. What an example you give the people to live by. Let's keep traditional family values God prevail. - Indeed. A toast to success all around. Everybody join me in raising your glasses in honor of William Doran and the best state in the nation. God bless Utah. God bless America. And Doran for senate. Doran for senate. - Why didn't you tell your wife? - My wife she gave up her past, her beliefs, everything to make me happy. We reared our daughter up in the church as a wholesome woman. She was saving herself for marriage you know. Jessica has worked way too hard to make me happy and to raise our daughter right in the eyes of our Heavenly Father. I just, I couldn't, I couldn't tell her. I couldn't break her heart like that. I just, I choked. - I don't approve of this gown. Wear this. And can you least try to pretend you're enjoying this. We put a lot of work into this. And you're father's career depends on this. Have you least mingled with Senator Thomas's daughters yet? Theo, come on you always used to have so much fun when you were younger. - Mom, you look lovely and I'm fine. I'm just observing, people watching. There's nothing wrong with that. - I suppose not. I do love you darling. Wear the jacket. - Love you too Mom. - I am so proud of all of this but I have to warn you other candidates have a way of sneaking up the last minute. We have to stick to our guns here. There's no room for any gray areas. - I understand although I don't agree with all of it. For example I'm not opposed to gay marriage or even abortion for that matter. I am a Conservative, yes. Fiscally responsible and God loving yes. But the rest of it's just not me. I mean this is all happening really fast and I'm not sure if I-- - Well they absolutely cannot know that. Understood? Your win depends on consistency in this red state. If you want votes you most do what I say. - Hey thank you guys so much for coming. - Thank you for having us. - We loved having you here. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - What a beautiful party, it was so great. - Thank you so much for coming. - Thank you. It was lovely. - Thank you so much for coming. - It was so nice to see. - Nice to see you too. - Well my beautiful wife I think that was nothing less than a success. Did you hear what they said? - No. - We've got this thing. - I'm so proud of you. And I haven't seen you this happy in a long time. Brings me back to those days when your band was in the spotlight and I couldn't love you more. I'm still your groupie. Okay, well it's late and I think we should be turning in. Let's let the maids handle all this in the morning. - Oh hey, I'll be up in just a sec. I just wanna put out the fire and the candles at least. - Okay, don't be too long. Dad. - Oh my goodness daughter, you scared the life out of me. Did you enjoy the party? - Yeah, it was lovely. Good sweetheart. - Dad, I had something I wanted to tell you but you have to promise not to get mad. - Famous last words. This better be good news on a night like this. - It is good news for me and hopefully it'll be good news for you too. - Okay, do tell. - Maybe you should sit down. - Why don't we sit down together. - Okay, just come right out and say it. Dad, I'm in love. - Oh Theo, my goodness, you're only 17. Okay, who's the lucky guy? Is he someone from our ward? This is what you've been so reclusive about. It's fine. We'll meet his parents and you can start courting each other properly without being in the shadows. It'll all be just-- Sir. - Dad, this is Pamela. I love her and I'm gay. I just couldn't hide it anymore and I thought it'd be better to tell you than for you to find out another way. I'm gay dad. I always have been. I know it's a lot to take in and it's gonna be hard to understand. Pamela is an amazing person. She makes me happy. She saved me. - Mr. Doran, I know this is a really important time for you but I promise with all of my heart that I will make your daughter happy. She's the light of my life. She's turned my whole perspective of life around. - How dare you? I recognize you, you're that maid from next door, the Johnson's place. How in the, what in, Theo, do you have any idea what you're saying? This is an abomination. To give up a temple marriage, I don't understand. This will not work for a child of mine. I refuse to accept this. And you, how dare you come in here to my house and taint the very walls and foundation with your evil. You have corrupted my daughter. - I'm sorry sir. Please I never meant to. - Oh, you didn't mean to. Well you did and now you have to pay the price. You have tainted my daughter and made her impure. You seductive witch, you probably seduced her. - Dad, she did nothing wrong. It wasn't her. This is who I am. I chose her. She accepts me for who I am. - If you choose this path you're dead to me. Do you understand me? I would rather have you die, in fact I would rather be dead myself than have a daughter who's gay. Mark my words. - What happened to my punk rock dad? What happened to him? This is so unfair. - What are you still doing here? Get out, get out of my sight! Theo, just go to your room and pray on this, okay. Look there are places that we can go that we can have you cured of this. Everything's gonna be okay. All right. - I hate you. I hate you! I wish I had died. You'll never understand. I know about you and mom. You're such a hypocrite. I know about how you two met and how it came to be. Just imagine if that were to get out. How I could expose your precious little campaign. - Let me get this straight so that there's no confusion, you told your daughter after she came out to you as a lesbian and introduced you to her, the maid, that you'd rather she be dead than accept the situation. - Wait, wait, that's completely out of context. He's clearly, clearly upset. You don't have to answer that one. - It's okay. Look I know it was harsh, I was so livid, you have no idea how much it ruined my night let alone how much it would ruin my career as a politician. But I swear to you, I would never hurt my little girl. I was trying to help her. I wanted to do what was best for her. If I wanted to hurt her why would I tell you what I said. - He makes a point Joanna, if he were involved in her disappearance he sure as shit wouldn't have admitted to saying that. - Hobbs, I have other questions to ask. All right let's, let's go a different direction. What do you know about Pam, Pamela? - Not much really. I know she was the maid at the Johnson's place next door. She couldn't have been more than 20 maybe. Oh and I've always heard rumors, that well Mr. Johnson likes to hire maids and landscapers under the table, you know. So who knows if any of these people even have paperwork. All I know is she seduced my daughter. This whole thing is a nightmare. - Do you have any other questions for my client? Because unless you're going to arrest him or hold him as a suspect, I suggest you let him leave. Let's go William. So I saw that plaque over there, I guess you were in the CIA? How about you? - Lieutenant United States Navy Shadow Walkers. - Black Ops. - Patches off. - How long? - Oh, you're never really out. - Well thank you for all that you do. - Oh and thank you for all that you didn't. - Gentleman could we just get down to the business at hand. - More tea Mr. Johnson? - That'll be all for now Kitty. - Yes, sir. - Jesus Christ Kitty, this tea is cold. What the hell? - I'm sorry sir. - The tea's fine. - Leave the detectives their tea but mine is lukewarm, bring me another. Don't mind Kitty, her family is dead. This job gives her a bit of purpose. Just trying to pay it forward. - Right. Okay, Mr. Johnson tell us how you know your maid Pamela, I mean when did you see her last? - I haven't seen her in days. Needless to say, she has been fired. - Oh God, how hard it is to get good hired help around here. - Okay, where did she come from? Or I mean how did you go about hiring her? - She came highly recommended from a friend. While she was here she was superb. Hardworking and kept her head down. An atrocity really that she would leave us in a lurch like this. - Do you know her last name? - I think her last name was Silva or Salva. Oh hell, I don't know maybe it was Santos, I can't remember. - All right, so I'm assuming that she's here illegally since you don't know her last name and you probably didn't even bother getting a visa for her. - What do you mean? Who do you think you are? What are you going to do, get your absurd social media happy president to deport my staff? Well you can just get the hell out of here. - No, no, we are here investigating a missing girl. Now possibly even two missing girls. We're trying to help. We believe that one of those girls could be Pamela. - Well I'll be dammed. - That's not all sir. And article of clothing at the crime scene the blood on it tested positive to be of the daughter of your next door neighbor Theo Doran. More blood at the scene we suspect was Pamela's. They were some sort of relationship. - Bull shit Pamela. When would she of had the time? I mean, oh God, that Will Doran, he would do anything for the love of money and power. And if his daughter Theo was anything like him well good riddance if you ask me. And as far as Pamela goes she probably raked in all the money I gave her and took it home to Brazil. - Right. We're done. Oh my God, that man is such an ass. - Yeah, tell me something I don't already know. - You know could you for one second pretend to have some semblance of common courtesy. - I got it out of him. - You know what you need to do now. - I'm already checking on flights to Brazil. - Thank you. Ingrid do you have any other findings or results for this case? I mean the more we dig the more complex it's getting. We've got a angry Dad who is, has motive but why would he tell us that? I don't know it's just so bizarre. We're missing something. - Yeah, right now we specialists looking into the blood splatter. I have no conclusive results about the other individual's DNA. Without a match we have nothing but I did get the fingerprints back from the letter and they were Theo's. There were no other fingerprints to analyze though. I'm so sorry Joanna. If there's anything else I find I will let you know. - Thanks Ingrid you're a life saver. Maybe literally in this case. All right I'll see you later. - See ya. Thank you. - You are a deserving human being that has received love from another human being. You are unstoppable. You've given love and you've received love. You've done it Theo. The future is bright. You own the sky. This is for Shandra. - Stop. That girl in the bathroom. Shut up, shut up, let this happen. If you tell anyone about this I will kill you. I will kill you! Misty, grab the gauze and peroxide will need to clean the wounds and wrap them when she's done. What kind of monster would do this? We're not sure. He was masked. Did you call the police? - No she doesn't want that. Isn't this American? He can't get away with this especially with the whole Me Too thing. - I can't risk this getting out. I feel so trapped. Not only will be told that this is why , considered tainted now. My father always expected a temple marriage after this, he's expect so much. Is everything okay Pamela? - Tia, I have to talk to you. - Knocking. - Tia, you've been my best friend since forever please. And this better be good. - I don't know how to say this, my God, I was violated yesterday. What do you mean violated? - I was raped. I was raped. And I think I know who it was. What do I do? I mean who does-- - Wait, wait, wait, slow down. - I can't. - You might wanna look into that sensitivity course we talked about online. Ingrid, hi. - Hi. - Got you call, what's so important? - So we've looked at the blood splatter and it appears that it's been self inflicted. - I told you wasn't a slash and dash. - What do you mean? - Well there were no blood clots at the scene, which indicates that it was swift and violent. With a perpetrator the blood spray is usually a fine mist and it wasn't, it was contained and it was big and there were less drops. Without a body I don't-- - So you don't think this is a murder at all. - There's no body, there's no perpetrator, no guns shots, I'm just as confused as you are. - Okay, well thanks Ingrid. - Thanks. - Okay. See you later. - See ya. . Jessica. Oh, my sweet girl. Oh, please. - Dude you should of seen it man, she was squealing like a pig. She didn't even know what hit her. J Dog hit her hard. And you know what? Screw her dad. - You sick bastard. You get way too much ass for your own good. - Hey do you guys think I could get a ride home? - Dude what the hell you can't, you can't make it on a 0.5 limit. - Hey J Dog, heard you like it hot. Think you can hit this hard? - Heard he makes girls moan till they're howling at the moon. - Are you boys looking to party? - Who's asking? And how do you know about me? - Word gets around when you do it right. - Oh, shit, can't argue with that. Where you fine ladies wanna go? - Hey bro, get me another beer. Right bro. - Yeah. - Well hello. - I bet you're a naughty boy. Oh. I think you need a spanking. - Okay, all right. You boys want another drink? - Hell yes I do. Pass that shit over. Oh, oh, oh, my God, wow. That has got some kick to it. Woo. - So when you ladies gonna take off these masks. - Only if you're lucky and only if you deserve it. What's a party without music? - Woo you ladies you're into some hardcore stuff, huh. - Okay. I like where this is going. - Let's play a game boys. How kinky are you? - Bring it on bitch. - You boys have no idea what you've got yourselves into. - Temp me. - Oh dear. - Okay tying up, all right. That's where it's at. - Now. - Oh fuck. - Whoa, whoa what the hell? Whoa man you good? - Oh no, oh it burns, oh damn. - What's going on? Whoa what's that? What are you doing? - Your scarlet letter, Jacob. This is for the one you violated. No matter what you tell other people, they'll know the trust for the rest of your life. - What the hell did I do? Why you tying me up? - Quilt by association. - Touchdown. - How's Will doing with everything? - Excited, distant, hell I don't know anymore. What am I? Who are we? - I'll drink to that. - Well, all right then. - Give me that wine. - Wait. - Wait a minute, hey you haven't had a drink in like a decade. - And would you guys rather have me popping my happy pills? I'm not stupid ladies. I know I've been a foul and I've buried all these years in opioids and antidepressants. And I know you're not blind, this is an intervention of sorts, right? - Well you know what? Pick your poison. Back to reality. How is Theo? - Theo, she has been doing much better lately. From what I've seen she's been smiling. - Well cheers to that. - Cheers to that. - Oh, my gosh. - This is good. - Yes, you know in all honesty ladies, I love you for who you are. Pills or no pills, drinks or no drinks. Heck God or no gods. Okay, the important thing is that we, we need to stick together. Okay, I don't wanna be those women that they drift apart just because they have lives and they get busy, okay. Promise me, promise me that. - Well I'm in. You ladies get me through anything. - Yeah, cheers to that. - Cheers to that. - Okay, I will drink to that. - Will you guys marry me? - Group hug. - That's my earring. - Oh, my god. - Brother Doran, we're so excited to see what's gonna happen to your campaign. It's great to see again. It seems this is God's will, Will. Oh man, you have God behind you Elder. - Thank you, I'm happy to hear that. I'm afraid there's a problem. My heart is breaking and I don't know if I have the strength to keep going. - Whatever can it be? Surely with God on our side we can find a solution together. - Well, last night after my campaign party my daughter broke some pretty awful news to me. Not only is she gay but she's in a relationship with the girl next door. What have I done wrong? I have sacrificed everything for her. I'm so confused and angry to tell the truth. - This is a, this is not the news I was anticipating. This is heart wrenching indeed. And she told you this. - Yes. And there were words said that shouldn't have been said but I was angry. What can I do? I love my daughter with all my heart but I can't love this. - Surely this can't be good for your campaign. - I'm not even worried about the campaign anymore. She is throwing away everything I ever taught her. - You ever heard of conversion therapy? Basically it's like a retreat for you know other girls her own age struggling with her disorder. I mean she could just disappear and be reborn and cured of all these tendencies. - I already thought of that. I'm just still trying to grasp the fact that she not what I raised her to be. You must fast and pray on it and with God's help she'll come back into the light. And I mean she still has a lot to give to a husband and to her future kids. And she has a beautiful role to play in the Celestial Kingdom. Does she not? - Yes, yes, she's so smart, and so independent, so I guess I really I haven't thought of it beyond that but she's just my child and I love who she is. Does this, does this really make her any different? I mean is she suddenly not the same person I always loved? - The youth of today, they're easily corrupt. I mean mark my words she may be your daughter and you may dote on her but surely she's not without sin and definitely not without the need of our Lord's grace. We could all use grace Brother Doran. We're all sinners. - Indeed. But I'm out of ideas. She just seemed so perfect. She was just a child with top of her class grades, popularity and charm. Now she just seems so broken. - Well we, we're all broken Brother Doran. Each and everyone of us in this city of salt. - Jay, I've got nothing left for this case. All right, did you check the flights to Brazil? Yes. - And the search parties and the volunteers. - Came up empty handed, nothing. - What about the homes that we got warrants for, including the Doran's? - Nothing was very useful. Nothing expect for the journal we got of Theo Doran's that her mother gave us. Full poetic ramblings, that girl was a neurotic mess. - I would be. What do you mean by poetic ramblings? - Just emo goth stuff, Pagan witchcraft as far as I could tell. - What the hell? - Yeah, just you know I love you this, we're bound to the earth with that. Just razor blades of love kind of stuff. - Well it's clear what happened. I just, those footprints. - Those footprints are not a red herring. - I don't want another goddamn cold case hanging over our heads. - If you're interested in chasing down those footprints any further be my guest. - Lock it down Hobbs. I'm gonna have to call Mr. Doran. Why are you calling him? - Because I have more tact. We're out of leads. And from the looks of it from the forensics his daughter took her own life. The evidence, the raging water that day, the bodies must have been swept downstream and carried underground. This case is cold. - Then we close as a suicide. - Anything but that. - Dad, hey Dad. Dad this is important. - What is it Jacob? - I, I did something I really regret yesterday. I mean one moment I'm throwing a football and the next I'm roped into this thing and Shandra needed some protection. - And why shouldn't you protect your innocent little sister? - I'm not saying I shouldn't defend Shandra, I just did something really, really bad. Is this something you're gonna get suspended from school for? - No, I just I-- - Is it something that's gonna have a bad impact on the upcoming game? - I don't know but-- - Be a man. You have your whole life ahead of you you're my prized son. My purpose. My star. You're the one chosen to lead this football team. So I suggest whatever it is you use your wits and logic to get rid of it. As a staple of our community you need to man up and rise to the challenge. - Yeah. - Get out here. How dare you interrupt me when I got this upcoming state conference in Ute. Don't you have football game to prepare for? - Yeah, yeah, yes sir. - Yeah. - Yeah. take a little piece of me you just can't see something you can't take - Father in heaven please if you're out there if I have sacrificed for anything, if there's anything that I've given my life for - Please, please send me a sign. Heavenly Father. You changed my life, you gave me everything I wanted. You changed my whole life. You gave me a family. A community that respects me, success, and wealth, and. I don't understand. What's the cost of all this? Please, please, I humbly ask you to bring my daughter back. I don't care what happens to me. Do with me whatever you want just bring my Theo back safe and sound. Oh God. I would rather die than have her be dead because of me. - Dad, this is Pamela. I'm gay Dad, I always have been. I love her. She saved me. Have you ever been saved before? - You saved me. So I will love her too. We'll make this work. Everything will be okay. It doesn't matter what other people think. You are my world. And your mom is my world. And if Pamela is your world then she's my priority too. - Mrs. Doran. - Mrs. Doran. Do you have any answers for us about you husband's death? Do you have comment about your daughter's death? - Do you think it has anything to do with your daughter disappearance? Your daughter's disappearance. The community of Zion still in disbelieve is holding a candle light vigil tonight. Friends and family of the Doran's called into KCOS to express their love. Theo was always so nice at school, she was a little different but you could tell she would stop at nothing just to be herself. She's my best friend and helped me through so many tough times. I just wish I could have done more to help her. We aim to spread awareness and find out what really happened here. William Doran was man who loved and was committed to our state and his local community but most of all William Doran loved and cherished his family. A family loving man. The kind of person that felt deeply about traditional values. We were also able to speak with Sheriff Pershing and Deputy Nitrah concerning Theo Doran's investigation. They had this to say. On behalf of the Sheriff's department we cannot comment any further. We consider this an ongoing investigation and we are not gonna give up hope. We wish to extend our deepest condolences to the Doran family, and well anybody else involved in this. If you are or anyone you know is struggling with depression or thoughts of suicide don't be afraid, call 1-800-273-TALK. - This state has one of the highest suicide rates in the country. - No more suicides. No more suicides. - This has got to stop in the name of Doran's we have to raise resources for those who are mental ill in our community. Yes. - Yes, we do. - No more. No more! No more suicide. No more suicide. - No more suicide. No more suicide. - No more suicide. No more suicide. - I didn't know, had I known Will, I would've tried a long time ago to bring you back to life. And stop adhering to an image that was not us. What I would give to have my Will back. My rockstar. I am your groupie forever. I am so, so sorry. - Honey, come with us. Don't you think Will would want you to spend the night celebrating his life instead of mourning it? - Yeah Jessica, come with us please. - Yeah we have chocolate. - No babies, I need to be here with my husband long as I can, pay my respects. - Okay, come on girls, let's give her some space. But if you need anything and I mean anything call me, you text me, I will have my phone next to me all night. I love you Jane. - I love you Jess. - You are such a good friend. - We're gonna get through this together. - Please let me have my time. - Of course. - Thank you. - Stop Jessica, stop! - Mr. Johnson. - Jessica, if I had known that this was gonna happen I would have told you sooner, believe me. One night I was going through my business papers and I heard a commotion in Pamela's bathroom. You okay in there, Pamela? What the hell's going on? - It's, my friend was attacked. - Well, meet me in the study when you finish getting cleaned up in here. - Mr. Johnson, this is my dear friend Theo from next door. - I'm not blind. I see you two coming and going around here all the time. - Sir, does that mean that you know what's going on? - Well I do know that you two are very found of each other. And it's also apparent that something bad has happened. Theo, I must tell you right off that I am not found of your father but I also know that you're not a clone of your father. You know I am not the cold hearted bastard that I appear to be. So tell me what ails you? And Pamela you are like a daughter to me so if you can vouch for Theo so can I. - But sir-- - I have connections. You're here for a reason Pamela. I appreciate your work but I can also relate, try me. - Well I met her and this is a long story. Kitty, would you bring us some tea please. - I'm actually LDS sir, I don't drink tea. - Just bring the tea, Kitty. - Yes sir, tea right away. - We have some very important things to talk about. - Yes sir, I understand that your a major supporter of our team at Zion, whatever you want. - It's no secret that you are your father's prized all star and I have been following your game as well. - Thank you, sir. - But I also know about your little discrepancy. - I'm not sure I know what you're-- You know exactly what I'm talking about boy. - Did my dad talk to you? No. - I think I should go. - If you value your father's opinion, if you value your reputation and future, if you value the love of the game, sit down, shut up, and listen to what I have to say. As an outsider in this community but also a financial supporter of this community I hear a lot of things some more petty than others. Utah has a very unique culture and I wouldn't trade that for the world but what you have done let's just say you're going to pay for it. And not only pay for it you're going to help me with this problem. - Okay. - Are you ready? I'm ready. - Okay, let's disappear. - It is time ladies, all is in place. Are you sure you're ready? Whoa, whoa. - Just a little security measure boy, although nothing can forgive what you have done to Theo. Taken her against her will, taken her innocence. Well you can at least pay. Oh and understand some of the local women had their way with you too. This is something that will hang over you always and I will always know. - Yes, sir. - Well do what most be done. Now Theo. - Ow! Oh my God. - This is the only way. The only way we can be together. - All is well ladies, I know this is hard but it must be convincing. There will be a car waiting up on the road with gauze bandages and other items to get you cleaned up. Isn't there something else you have to say Jacob? - It's not as much as I feel like I owe but it's my entire life savings. I hope it can give you a new start. It's the least I can do. I'm so sorry. - Everything has been arranged ladies. Kitty will be waiting up on the road in a black car there she'll have dry clothes and everything you'll need to get cleaned up. Here is your new IDs and passports. Jacob, will you put that in the backpack? Pamela, you are know called Demi, Theo, you are now Theresa. And Jacob you have your fingerprints all over the dagger, one word and I will expose you to the world for your crime against women. - I understand. - Now we must make this look real. Now drop your bloody hoodie by your backpack. You need to let the blood drip into the water. Now, take Pamela's backpack as we planned then meet Kitty on the road. Go, run now. We are all sinners Jacob. No matter differences in religion or background, or love lives, we all have to answer to one another at some time. Tonight you have made a step in the direction of justice. Your father would be proud. - Please, please don't tell him. - I won't, I won't, as long as you understand that you never saw anything here. Not now, not never. - Okay. - Okay. Now let's go. You have a game to prepare for and we all know how you love the game. Let's finish this thing. - Yes, sir. - So she's alive. - Yes, Theo is alive. - Okay, where's my daughter? - I don't know. However I do know that she will get in touch with you when she's ready. And I also know that both she and Pamela are safe and free of judgment. This city is not yet ready for change but it will be soon with the help of people like you. You need to be a light, be a light for your peers, be a light for your community and be a light for your church. The night your husband killed himself I was headed over to your house to tell him everything. I saw him driving away so I got in my car and I followed him but I didn't know where he was going. I drove so aimlessly, I drove to the police station, I drove, I drove to your Bishop's house but then it occurred to me he went to where Theo disappeared. I drove there as fast as I could but obviously I was too late. I'm, I'm so sorry. I should have know, I should have know. - I still don't know what you want me to do. - I don't know what you should do. But you should do what's in your heart. Maybe you should run for senator. Make some real changes around here. - I love you too. myself up off the ground listen to my broken sound me as I'm feeling down Tomorrow we have the test of our time ahead of us. We have many difficult challenges to face. But together, together and unified we are a force to reckon with. we waited for so long we'll have it, I promise we waited for so long it, we'll have it, the chance we wont waste it making when I see it this system we have braved stay involved day to day chains, let them fall away thru the stormy weather died, the few who survived it, I can see thru it trial,, I can tell everywhere, fists in the air we waited for so long we'll have it, I promise we waited for so long we'll have it, I promise change but it never does change but it never does middle school-ish politics stronger current than these
