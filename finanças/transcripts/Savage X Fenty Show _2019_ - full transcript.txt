Yeah, we about to... Oh, my gosh! This show's a unique hybrid of music, of fashion, of dance that celebrates diversity. Technically, it's a fashion show, but Rihanna doesn't do anything that's already out there, so it's elevating that concept. This looks so good. I can't wait for it to just, like, happen now. I'm more excited than anxious. Whoo! ♪ ♪ I'm looking for unique characteristics... in people that aren't usually highlighted in the world of fashion as it pertains to lingerie and sexy, what... what society seems is... or sees sexy. There's not, like, a target audience. It's for everyone. It's... everything that she does is for everyone. She wants everyone to feel beautiful, everyone to feel empowered, everyone to feel and have that strength within them to become the best version of themselves. As a kid, I've always used fashion as a defense mechanism, but that and music and makeup and lingerie, these are all just different ways that I can express my creative... It's all me as the muse. It's all me that's, like, behind everything. When she turned 18, she was just ready to go. She just started taking everything into her own hands and doing it herself. So how we can make history. So right, this is, like, the big thing, right? So what do we want to stand for, right, for a lot of components that people will start understanding as the brand is born. But I don't... I don't think that you go out and say that as your talking point and saying... No. - ...we're making history, Because when you keep yourself up at night thinking about how to make history, you're not gonna make it. ♪ ♪ We're exploring a lot of different sizes and making women feel like they're not excluded just because they're a different size. Every woman deserves to feel sexy. We are sexy; we are multifaceted, and I want women to embrace that to the fullest. When I can feel sexy just for myself, it allows me to feel even sexier when there is someone else. I mean, let's be honest. You can turn yourself on, right? Sexy and confident is really owning the two and not letting anyone else take that from you regardless of what they have to say. Of course I have body issues. Everybody does. I've never heard of anybody who thought that they were, like, perfect. I think seeing it as one seamless piece of performance art, - for want of a better word... - Yeah. ...that integrates fashion, dance, life, art as performance... - Yeah. - ...is a very exciting way - Of putting on a show... - Mm-hmm. ...and goes against the grain of ev... of what everyone else does. That's exactly how I'm seeing it. Okay. - I... I literally am seeing their bodies as... as pieces of art... Great. ...and that we can really make visual impact with that. We have worked with Rihanna on shows and events for about seven or eight years. The most challenging task we've ever had with her is to be able to take a show and reinvent it in a way that will translate to millions of people worldwide in a television product. If you stacked five models and they were... and... and from... from the square-on perspective, you don't see those five, but as each one steps away, - it reveals a new form... - Yeah! ...and it's just the one shot that takes you slowly into the environment. Also, the interesting thing... Why don't you... You should be a director. Like, for real. You kind of... So we're six weeks out at the moment. I'm a little concerned about the logistical challenges of... of turning it around. Do we have the time to execute that and... and t-to make sure that the range of models and dancers and everything else ticks those boxes and it feels so inclusive in terms of this environment that we're... we're showing everyone? Normally, s-six weeks is... is ambitious on a normal show, but on a show of this scale, it's intimidating. Logistically, timing is not on our side. I think we should think of it like a fashion musical. Yep. Mm-hmm. You know? There's... there are the dancers, and then there are the actors. Technically, it's a fashion show, but, you know, again, Rihanna doesn't do anything that's already out there, so it's... it's elevating that concept, and it's something that, you know, if the world's going right, we're gonna go left. That's just how she functions in general. Whoo-whoo! Yes, honey! The most exciting part of the design process of the Savage X lingerie brand is just telling a story that is from my own perspective. Oh, my God. This is fantastic. All right, now the girls can... I love the black. There's no rules with designing lingerie. You can do anything. You can go as far as you want. You can go as comfortable as you want. You can go as sexy as you want. And it's just a whole new outlet of creating, making things from scratch. There is nothing that you see out there that she does that she doesn't put her hands on first and touch and try, and, you know, it's... it's unbelievable. I'm sorry. I got it on your butt. Did you like this? No. No. Okay! Everything was thought about, down to the detail of the tags: how they feel and how easy they are to remove, 'cause nobody wants to see a big tag when they're trying to get cute for their special someone, you know what I'm saying? I got some dancing to show you from Parris. Mm. What you doing on my computer? Okay. This is the opening. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I really like this break. And, like... You can. ♪ ♪ That's it. I think I could learn that before I even get in the presence of Parris. You, like, already learned it. Yeah, that's, like... that's two minutes right there. - You got it. - And she's... you got it. - That's one minute that... - But do I got it? Oh, my God, that's so good that you're doing that. As in, like, did you send that to me? I'm so excited you're gonna be in the show. So it looks like you're dancing. And it looks like she's dancing too. - Yeah, yeah. - 'Cause you put that in there. - Am I in the show? - I think you're in the show. You're in the show now. Girls, I think I just want the one hand, just one, two, pop. We got seven days to the show. We still have no finale. We have no finale, so I'm a little stressed. So, girls, can you go from your ending pose for me, please? Ready? Five, six, seven, eight. And kick it. The thing that makes me connect to Parris' choreography the most is the strength. Pat! Let's go! There's nothing delicate about it. There's nothing fragile about it. It's in your face. I think this just needs a little more drama, maybe to drop. Yeah, it just needs drama there, 'cause it's just giving me that right now. She goes hand in hand with that, the kind of strength and that confidence. Move your head. Okay. Savage is hot, and hot is fun. There's so much difference and uniqueness within the line that I think represents different sides of me. To me, sexy is just being my goofiest, because that's my truest form, so it's like eating 20 chicken nuggets naked with barbecue sauce. ♪ ♪ We started confirmations a-after yesterday. Mm-hmm. - After you picked. So I just wanted to give you an update of a few people. Stacey is confirmed. This is Stacey. It's very important that the casting kind of tells the narrative of what the brand stands for, and what we stand for mainly here is inclusivity. That's what I stand for with everything that I create. She's all set. She's confirmed. She fit today. Is there any bad news in this pile? - No. - What are you wearing? What are you wearing? What are you wearing? I don't know. I gotta go to fitting. Right now, it's about... 10:30. We still have hours left. I mean, we're gonna be here till probably, like, 3:00. Exciting! Yeah. Super excited to have you for your... third Fenty show? - Yay! - Right? - Third Fenty show. It feels good, like, the stretch. Huh? Crotch-less. Oh, it's crotch-less? It's crotch-less. Whoo! This is my first show ever with Savage. I literally tell all the girls, if I can twerk in it, then that's the one. ♪ ♪ We still have models here that have been waiting for four and five hours. Oh, my God, man. - So once we're on, right... - Yeah. ...this show, we don't come back on, so I could sneak into the audience and watch the rest, correct? It's just evolving. Everything is better. Everything is different. I'm a mom now, so I gotta embrace more sexy now. ♪ ♪ I'm ready to belly dance. I'm looking at some familiar faces of people I know, um... like Laverne; I see Laverne there. ♪ Sticks and stones don't break my bones ♪ ♪ But whips and chains excite me ♪ ♪ Na-na-na, come on ♪♪ There's, like, ten dancers outside still that we have to fit in four looks each. I've asked her a few times today, "How many models are coming in tomorrow? How many dancers are coming in tomorrow?" So that would be good to know. - Lies, all of you. - Worse. Being the best version of you is what's sexy to me. When you feel confident about yourself, you glow on the outside. It's so important to show inclusivity, different people of various ethnicities and backgrounds. It's like, being Savage is having the most fun. We are in the actual crux of the build. We have the lighting and the sound in the air right now. We have the framing of the set in place, and so it's now actually starting to see the vision that we've had come together. Wow. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my... oh. This is insane. The first time, it's always a... it's a... like, heart-pounding moment when you walk into a space. I feel the balance is correct. I feel the proximity is good, the intimacy is good, and I feel for camera. I can capture the moments that we've all got excited about w-when planning this with Ri. Hello. Hello! That just happened.
