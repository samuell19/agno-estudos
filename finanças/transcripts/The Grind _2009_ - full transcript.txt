ENOUGH FOR ME TO PAY OFF THE GUZMANS IN FULL AND COVER SOME OF COURTNEY'S MEDICAL STUFF. SHE THOUGHT NOBODY WOULD EVER FIND HER ATTRACTIVE WITH A SCAR ON HER LEG, BUT I TOLD HER SHE WAS WRONG. I GAVE HER AND JOSH A FISTFUL OF CASH AND BEFORE IT WAS ALL OVER, I HAD ONE MORE PROMISE TO KEEP. IT COST ME 20 FUCKIN' GRAND TO KEEP THAT PROMISE THE WAY I WANTED TO. IT COST 4 GRAND FOR EACH GUNMAN... ANOTHER 4 GRAND FOR A PUNISHER. IT ACTUALLY COST ME 24 GRAND. I ORDERED A SECOND PUNISHER. JOSH HAD EARNED IT.
