D'you know what? I listen to all my friends, and I don't get the one of you. You're all neurotic, bitching, worried, and insecure. Mate, what the hell for? We're 23 years old. We don't have wives, we don't have kids. We don't own anything that owns US. For god's sake, we barely have jobs. And we are here. This is the greatest time of our lives. You should do what I do. Yeah, what's that? Do what you want. Do what you feel. Trust the universe. And when you do, trust me... it will all work out. Girl: Hi. Hi. Hi. Did you sleep all right? Yeah, yeah. You? You were kind of out of it. [Chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. No, it's okay. Last night was one of the best nights of my life. Me, too. [Laughs] Can I use your bathroom? Yeah. Last night was the worst night of my life! What happened? Well, first... first of all, I slept with apple. What's wrong with that? Mick, I can't sleep with apple because I'm in love with Cassie, and apple is Cassie's friend. So... why did you sleep with apple? Dude, I don't know. I don't know, okay? Last night was so fucked up. All right, calm down, calm down. Start from the beginning and tell me what happened. Okay. Fuck. Um... whew. Okay, so, I'm at the club... [Dance music playing] And I'm spinning. Wait a second.

I've changed. What, like a sex change? Hey, seriously. No, that's great. You're, like, a nobel prize winner. I'd have sex with you... Immediately. Listen, honestly, it's a really important night for me, and I don't need a scene, okay? So, I need you to keep that girl away from me. I'll do it for 100 bucks. What?! I need the money, Ryan!

Ryan: So, she walks out, and where do you think she goes? Guess what? Do you see what you've done? It only takes me five minutes to talk Sarah down, but by the time I get outside, the first thing I hear is... Killer move, man. She is hot! You're my god. You dog. Wait, is everybody talking about me? Of course. You just got a Hummer in Derek's office. No, i... I realize that if Cassie hears this bullshit rumor before I can explain, I am fucked. Never mind.

Delaney, hey... what the fuck? What? You were supposed to keep that girl away from me! I mean, i... i... no, listen to me, Ryan, okay? I'm confounded by stress right now, and I could really use your help, okay? All I'm asking you for is a very simple... $200. $200? Yep. $200? Where am I gonna get $200? 50. $50. You know what? I just want you to go away. Just go away. I want you to get away from me now. I'm just trying to keep it real, Ryan. I thought you could understand that. Idiot. Idiot. Aubrey! Aubrey. Aubrey. Aubrey. Yeah. Please... where's Cassie? Oh, she's right there. [Music playing] [Laughing] Who the fuck is that guy? Oh, that's Tony Russo. Whoa, no, no, no. Who the hell is Tony Russo? I don't know. He calls himself, like, an actors' manager. But I just think he's one of those, like, date-raping mafioso freaks, you know? He tells young, hot chicks he's a manager, so then he can, like, take them out then he gets them, like, really fucked up, so, you know, he can cop a little late-teen ass. Though I have seen him with that chick that used to be on that TV show Texas high. Or maybe that's his wife. Oh, but you want to hear the worst part? Cassie left her jacket here. Now I have to carry this thing around with me all night. Give me that. [Music stops, record crackles] What? Oh, man! [All grumbling] [Loud static] [Music resumes] Sorry. Sorry. Wow. So you think that chick from Texas high is really his wife? Not the goddamn point, Mick. Right. Sorry, mate. Dude, I mean, I let a record run out last night. Do you think Derek's gonna let that fly? I probably lost my fucking job. Yeah, not the best move, mate. No, not a great move. I was so out of my head. All I could think about was her. Okay, so you followed her? Right, yeah. So, I go outside, and I see her getting into this massive, fuck-off limo. So, I jump into my car and start to follow them, but the entire way to the club, I am thinking of Cassie giving some, like, late-teen ass to this fuckin' freak. So, when I get to the club, I'm out of my fucking gourd. Dude, it's 20 bucks, but you gotta... fuck off. So, I have to sneak past one bouncer and then another bouncer to get to the v.I.P. Room that I watched them go into. Cassie: A screen test? Man: Wait a second. What do you want? Cassie, you left your jacket at the club. Ryan. Can I speak to you for a moment outside, please? [Sighs] What the hell are you doing here? What am I doing here? What the hell are you doing here? I mean, I catch you with this date-raping mafioso scumbag? Ryan, he's a manager, okay? Come on, Cassie, you're not that stupid. And you caught me? Who the hell are you to catch me? You are all over that guy in there. You're all over him. What are you talking about? Okay, you know what? I thought we had something. I thought we had something. Don't we have something? Ryan, you think because we make out one night... what, we're supposed to get fucking married? I mean, give me a break. This isn't high school, all right? You're acting like a schoolboy. This is the real world, and you need to fucking grow up! Cassie: Fuck. Oh. Ow. [Rock music] [Laughs] Hey, Ryan! Hi, Zeke. You don't look so good. I suck. Okay, okay. You need a drink. Zeke buys me a drink, and then he buys me another drink. And then he looks at me and says... So, how you feelin'? Much better, thank you. Nah, man, I mean, how are you "feeling"? What? Don't be mad. But you seemed so bummed when we talked earlier, that I slipped a little something in your drink. [Pop] [Laughs] It's this new top-secret drug developed by this huge drug company. No one knows exactly what it does, but it's supposed to be mind-blowing. Zeke... You fucking drugged me? No, no, you don't understand. It's free! I'm giving out samples tonight to get people psyched to hook up. Dude, dig this. I just scored big-time, man. I gave two hits to this huge dealer named Tony Russo. [Gasps] [Whimpering] My god! What is this? All right, I'm a veterinarian. Somebody dropped you off here on the steps of our clinic. You were o.D.Ing, we thought we'd lost you. I gotta get out of here. [Dogs barking] Hey, hey! Come back here! [Gasps] [Barking] [Tires screech] Uhh! Aah! You're alive! Hey, you! Stop! Get me out of here! Get me out! Go, Aubrey! Go, go, go! Oh, my god! They said you were dead! Jesus Christ, Ryan! What the shit happened?! I don't know. Zeke said that you were o.D.Ing, then he dropped you off at this clinic on the steps. No, no. Fuck Zeke! He's the one who put me there in the first place. What?! That motherfucker. I can't believe this. Where are my clothes?! [Sobbing] You didn't show up at the clinic wearing any clothes! Why?! He gave me your shit. This is all I got. [Wailing] It's okay, it's okay. Phone. Oh, this is great. My fuckin' wallet's gone. My money's gone. What the fuck is this? "Ryan, I want you. I've always wanted you. I want to feel your..." [Cassie's voice overlaps] ...Skin next to mine. I want you inside me. Meet me at 625 main street... Ryan: "Apartment 408." Cassie: I'll be waiting. This... this is Cassie's handwriting. Cassie wrote this. Is this for me? Uh, yeah. Aubrey, you're not fucking with me? No, no, I saw her write that. When? At the club, in the bathroom. Oh, my god. Can you... Aubrey, can you drop me at my house? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, of course. Thank you, thank you. So, I rush home, get dressed, get into a cab, and I am in front of this door in, like, five minutes. Hello? Hello? Shit. Ohh. [Music playing] The drug. The drug. [Rumbling] Now I wake up here. What the fuck am I gonna do, Mick? Dude, she's making breakfast. She wants to spend the day with me. I can't spend the day here, Mick. I can't spend the day here because I need to get my fucking life back. All right, calm down. Here's what you do. You tell her that yesterday you found a stray dog in the park, and you brought it home, but it's sick, so you have to go home right now and nurse it back to health. What?! That will never work! It works like a charm. No. No, it works for you, man. It works for you. They all work for you. Trust me, mate. Chicks love it. They eat it up. Oh. Apple: Is everything okay in there? Yeah, no, I'm fine. Just give me one more second. I'm sorry. Dude, I gotta go. Thank you. Nice work. [Clears throat] [Whistles] Hey. Hey. How do you like your coffee? You know, actually, um... I'm sorry, apple. I can't hang out. My roommate just called. You see, I found this stray dog in the park yesterday, and apparently it got sick, so I gotta go home right now and nurse it back to health. You fucking liar! Whoa, now! [Cell phone ringing] Yeah? Mick: Level with me. Did you really pick up a naked Ryan at the veterinary hospital? My god, last night was such a joke. What happened? Okay, so, of course Cassie misses her shift 'cause it takes her, like, two hours to get ready. So, finally around 1 A.M., we make it to the club. ♪ I called my girl on the phone ♪ ♪ I called my girl in Rome ♪ ♪ I want to kiss the microphone ♪ Aubrey: We were causing major whiplash, but before we even have a second to enjoy it, Ryan's waving at US like he's about to come in his pants just seeing her. Oh, my god. Is he okay? And the weird thing is, when I point him out to her, she gets this scared look on her face... the same look I saw at her place earlier. I don't think I want to go tonight. Are you on crack? So, before I even have a second to contemplate this... Oh, thank god. I have to tell you something. Right now. She's in love with Ryan. No. Yeah. Interesting. Not really. But, of course, we have to have a huge discussion about it. I know you guys are friends and everything, and I don't want it to be weird between US, but you're the one who says that he really needs somebody who can be there for him, and I can do that. But he barely seems to know I even exist. Well, he's looking at US right now, so why don't we go to the bathroom? Come on. Heh. So, we head to the bathroom. Damn it! So, what's the problem? Okay, look... Me, you and Ryan have been hanging out together for, what, like, the last two years, right? And all in that time, I don't think Ryan has ever looked at me as... as a girl. And I mean, okay, I get it. He's this cool d.J., and I'm a law-school student/paralegal. He's part of this ultra-cool scene, and I'm only here on weekends. Yeah, but you're hot and you have great tits. Cassie: And why do you always undersell yourself? It makes you seem so much smaller than you are. Cassie's being, like, weirdly passive-aggressive. And what's the problem, anyhow? I mean, you want it, right? Well, yeah, that's what I've been saying. So fucking go get him! And I'm starting to wonder... could Cassie maybe like Ryan? Show him you want him. Or you know what would be hot? Write him a note. Write him, like, a really sexy note. What? Yeah. Write him, like, this fucking hot, cheesy note. Like... "I've always wanted you. I want to see your body. "I want your skin next to me. "I want to feel your skin on me. I want you inside me." Hold on, that's good. "I want you to feel me. I want your skin against mine." Yeah! "I've always wanted you. I just... i just..." fuck, fuck, fuck. "I want to feel your skin, you know? "I want to feel your skin against me. I want to feel you inside me." Do you know what I mean? And don't even sign your name. Just leave your new address... And then see what happens. Cassie, are you fucking kidding me? Well... [Laughs] I mean, you said he's this cool d.J., so, you know, if you want him, go get him! Yeah, but I said he's a cool d.J., I mean, he's also a great guy. I mean, that's why I like him, because I know him well enough to know that's not what he wants, Cassie. You think Ryan's any different? I mean, in this town, in this scene that you're going out in, everyone's sweet and interesting and nice and compassionate... Until they fuck you. And then you wake up, and they have some lame excuse like, uh... [Chuckles] Like they have some stray dog that they have to go home and take care of. And then they're gone... Before they can even have coffee with you. And that's it. Ryan's not like that. Ryan would never pull some stupid stray dog trick. Right? Cassie, what the fuck is wrong with you? Seriously! [Sighs] La-di-da. You asked me for my advice, and here it is. Do you want the note? No, I don't, because I don't need your games... Or whatever. [Flushing] I'm sorry. Suit yourself. All right, you guys, please... Let's just go out and have some fun. Let's blow. So, we head out of the bathroom... wait. So that conversation took 45 minutes? Fuck off, Mick. All right, love. Okay, so, we head out of the bathroom. Apple peels off 'cause she's totally pissed at Cassie. And Cassie and me are way, way high and in need of liquid refreshment. But just when we barely reach the bar... Excuse me. Excuse me. Okay, normally I would never do this, so I apologize in advance, but you're an actress, right? Please. Yes. Cassie. And who's asking? Tony Russo. Premier talent. I'm a manager. Oh, my god. I've seen you here, yeah? With that girl, um... the one who's on Texas high. Yes, she's a client of mine. Hmm. Want to take a walk? Talk a little bit? Yeah. Are you kidding? Hi, can I get a patrón and... are you fucking kidding me? Cassie! When I finally find her heading back to the lounge, she, like, waves me off. So, I'm trudging back to the bar... And guess who I see? Ha ha! Okay, look. Give Delaney money, Delaney goes away. Really? Yeah, yeah. I had to give him 50 bucks just to get off my case. Uhh, who do I have to blow to get a cocktail around here? Me? Eww. Ha! And before I can make it two steps... Aubrey. Yeah. Please... where's Cassie? Mick: I know this part. Right. So, Ryan goes off 'cause he's pissed, and at this point, my mouth is like a fucking desert. And I'm finally about to remedy the situation, when... [Loud static] [Music resumes] Sorry. Sorry. And after all that, I'm almost to the bar, when I see... okay, you're not gonna believe this. Come here! Listen to me! Where's my fucking husband? I know he's cheating on me! Hey, whoa. Hey, hey! Hey, isn't that the chick that used to be on Texas high? Oh, whatever. And I have to wait until they pry this psycho actress off the guy so I can finally get my drink. And when I get to the bar and finally quench the raging dust storm in my mouth, I realize I have no more money. Uh... Delaney. And when I tell the new bartender that I gave my last dime to that moocher, dig this... he knows Delaney. And not only that, he tells me some totally fucked-up shit. Delaney is pulling the George orwell. What's the George orwell? That's what I said. And he tells me that George orwell's this English guy who wrote this really famous book about, like, talking pigs and chickens and ducks... animal farm. Exactly. Now, what people don't know about George orwell is that he wasn't even George orwell. He was some lord or something from this ultra-rich family who decided he wanted to, like, make it on his own as a writer, so... [Beep] He changed his name, gave up all his money, and moved to Paris and became this starving homeless guy and wrote this other really famous book. Down and out in Paris and London. Exactly. Delaney is doing the exact same thing. He tells US he's a struggling artist when he's not even named Delaney! His dad's, like, some multi-gazillionaire who, like, runs this massive software company. Fucking cunt. No shit! And I'm about to go bitch-slap a bitch and get my 50 bucks back, when I see this guy. [Music playing] I'm Jack.

Zeke, where's the fucking clinic?! I don't know. It was, like... where?! Like, 27th and Adams or something. 27th and Adams. Okay. Near the highway! Near the highway! Go, go, go, go, go! Uhh! Where is it? Where is it? Fuck! Where is it?! Hi, I'm looking for a patient. We list by owner's name. By a what?! We list by owner's name. [Laughs] Oh, my god. Yeah, I didn't have a second to laugh because, um... When I get there, they tell me that he's dying. I don't know. I was sitting there, and I was... In this chair, and I was praying, and... [crying] And they told me that he's dead. And... I don't know. To hear those words again, I just, you know, fuck. Fuck. And I get his stuff, and I walk out, and I'm thinking... I don't know. Was it Cassie? Was it an accident? Was there something I could've done? And even if there was, would it have really made a difference? And why the fuck are we here? And does anything even fucking matter? [Sobbing] And, I don't know... i just really needed help, and... fuck! No one was picking up their phone. Please! So I did the worst possible thing I could do. I called my dealer. Darling, no. I know. You have something? So, I'm about to go be a total fucking loser and go back to that shit that almost killed me, but right at that very moment... [Tires screech] Aah! You're alive! Vet: Hey, you! Stop! Get me out of here! Okay! Get me out of here! Oh, my god! They said you were dead! Jesus Christ, Ryan! Okay, I'm freaking out, he's freaking out... Aubrey, go, go, go! And I am not shitting you... the man is butt-naked. Where are my clothes?! [Wailing] So, I throw him Cassie's jacket, and for some reason he's rifling through the pockets... When he finds the note. "Ryan, I want you. I've always wanted you..." And after everything the man's been through... I just didn't have the heart to tell him. Cassie wrote this. Is this for me? Yes! Aubrey, you're not fucking with me? No, no, I saw her write it. When? Um... at the club, in the bathroom. So, he thinks he's gonna go meet Cassie in 20 minutes. Can you drop me off at my house? Yeah. Thank you. This is so exciting! [Laughs] Ohh. At this point, I'm totally cured of any need to do drugs. And I drop him off, I'm driving home, and after everything I've been through, just to add insult to fucking injury... [Dog whimpering] What the fuck?! [Yaps] It must've jumped in at the clinic. And I take him back, and they say they don't have any record of him. So, now everywhere I go, I have to bring this. Oh, my god. Back up a second. What did happen between Cassie and Tony Russo? I don't know. I've been trying to call her all day. She's not answering her phone. [Yaps] I fuckin' hate this thing. [Telephone ringing] [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] Hey. Hey. Hey. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Fuck! Get a fucking grip. You were right, okay? Ryan is such a goddamn jerk. He pulled that stupid stray dog trick and walked out on me after I slept with him! He is such an asshole! Apple, I really can't talk about this right now. Like we don't spend hours talking about all your stupid shit! It's not like this is life and death. Okay. That's right. I forgot. Because life or death situations happen to you all the fucking time! Actually, there's a dead guy upstairs. Cassie, that's not funny. No shit! Oh, my god. Cassie, how the hell did this happen? I was at the club. I walk in, I see you, we go to the bathroom, when we come out, you peel off, and Aubrey and I hit the bar, when... excuse me, but you're an actress, right? So, I go to the lounge with him and he's telling me all about his clients. Yeah, he shot that in Vancouver. They only did 13, but he had a good time. He's got a big movie deal now. Hmm. Oh. Shit. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm supposed to meet these casting people at this new club. Tell you what. Here. Take my card. Give me a call next week, and we'll get together and... great. Or we could... Talk in the car. Want to tag along and meet these people? Don't tell me. I know. But he seemed really nice, and I was in this really, really weird mood, so, you know, I go. And we're in this big fuck-off limo, and I kept glancing out the window to see if he was taking me anywhere weird, and, you know, it was all good. He was really sweet. And he seemed really interested in my career. You know, so, we get to the club. After you. Good evening, gentlemen. Sorry I'm late. This is Cassie knight... hopefully my next big client. This is Bobby herrera and his casting associates James... And that's Tommy down there on the end. Francisco. Francisco, nice to meet you. Please, sit. So, after all that going back and forth, they're testing corrigan. We roll tape on Monday. Jesus, that's unbelievable. Bobby does all the casting at Paramount. Cassie: And I'm looking at this guy... like, he does all the casting for Paramount? But I'm listening, and their conversation is so legit that I'm figuring the guy's for real. So, I decide to step up. You know, I had something like that happen to me once. Um, I was screen-testing for this film... Ryan: Wait a second. What do you want? And I'm just so sick of Ryan always thinking he knows what's good for me before I even do that I chew him out in the hall, and I tell him to... Fucking grow up! So, I head back inside, and as soon as I do, I realize I was wrong, and I just really want to go meet up with Ryan. So, I just tell Tony... Hey, Tony. Listen, I'm gonna go. But it was so good to meet you. And I have your card, so... we just ordered. Are you sure you don't want to stay for another drink? Cassie: And, I don't know! I just figured he's this big manager, and, you know, maybe I should stay for one more drink. Tony: He was so drunk, man! They had to paint eyeballs on his eyelids for the last shot! [Laughter] [Overlapping chatter and laughter] And the next thing I know, I wake up here. Do you have any idea who this man is? No. This man is Tony "triggerman" Russo, Cassie! Who's Tony "triggerman" Russo? Don't you ever read the newspapers? No. He's been on the cover of all of them for at least a year now! Whatever! Who the fuck is he?! [Gunshots, police siren] [Woman screams] Oh, my god. Oh, my god. What do we do? What do we do? Calm down, okay, Cassie? Listen to me. I'm a fucking almost lawyer, ok? I can tell you that if you're caught with the body of Tony "triggerman" Russo in your bed, your life is over. You will be a suspect for murder. It'll be all over the newspapers and TV. You will never be an actress. This is some serious fucking shit! And not to mention... Russo's guys are gonna be looking for you right now. Now... If you call 911, I'm leaving. Otherwise, we have to get that body out of here. Okay. Oh, god. Okay, I'll take his legs and you take his arms. I don't want to take his arms. Cassie! What?! [Thud] Oh, my god. Okay, let's just leave him here and we'll go get something else. Apple: We should go back to your place and get him. The Van should be ready for pickup by now. I just want to say to you... before the cops come or some gangsters kill me or something... you really are the best friend in the entire world. Cassie, no. You are. Last night in the bathroom... I'm so sorry. I was such a fucking bitch. And I don't know why Ryan walked out on you after you were with him. I wasn't... "With him" with him. You guys didn't sleep together? No. Why, what happened? Last night, after you guys left, I went to the lounge. [Music playing] I'll have a... vodka soda. Sorry. No, it's okay. You go ahead. No, please. Okay. You know what? I'll get this one. Really... I'm not in the mood to talk. And just as I'm trying to extricate myself... I should probably get home. Okay. Hey, did you hear what happened? Ryan got a Hummer in Derek's office from that rich chick Sarah. And then he just left with her... In the middle of his set. [Laughs] [Chokes] Apple: The next thing I know, we're in Derek's office. Okay, wait, wait, wait. You know what? I can't do this. I mean... I could. [Laughs] But... I want someone else. And I'm putting my feelings for that person onto you. And I hate that. Oh, god, i'm... really drunk. Yeah. So, thanks for the drinks, but I just... I'm just gonna go. Now. Yeah. So, of course, when I get home, the power's out. So, I'm freaked out, and I'm heading into the kitchen, when all of a sudden, this gust of wind comes through it and blows the door shut. And my eye catches the window. I see the city and all these other people just... There. And I think... what is the point of knowing yourself if you're all alone? And then, almost as if it was a sign from god... Hello? Ryan? [Thud] So, I drag him to the bed. Shit. Oh, shit. Sit up. Okay. Okay. And in that moment, everything was perfect. Till we woke up. So, you don't have to apologize. Everything that you said was true. No. Ryan really is how you think he is, apple. I don't know why Ryan acted like he did this morning, but if he showed up at your house, he meant to. And he means what he does, and he does what he says. He's just like you. He deserves someone like you. You know what they say... your friends will help you move, but your best friends will help you move a body. Whew. Ready? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Someone came in here. Or he wasn't dead. He was dead. Are you sure? Oh, god. Oh, god. Cassie, calm down. Calm down. Oh, god. They're gonna fucking kill me. Please don't hurt US. Please don't hurt US. Shut up! Listen to me. I don't even know what happened last night. But I have a feeling it was as bad for you as it was for me. So, I think both of US should just forget that it ever happened. Yeah. Okay. Now, I'm looking for a nightclub promoter. I think you know him. A guy by the name of Mick.

No, I'm not. I'm not fucking joking. Would I come down here if it was a fucking joke? Do I look like I'm smiling? Am I happy? I'm serious. Fucking terrified serious. Ok, last night was the worst night of my life to date. Enlighten me. Okay. All right. Ahem. Okay. [Slurps] [Smacks lips] That's good. Okay, so... You know how, like, three months ago I did that really big art show? Well, it cost a fucking fortune to work with steel, and, of course, I didn't have any money. So, a friend of mine introduces me to this big-shot drug guy who does a little... a little loan-sharking on the side. This guy named Tony Russo. Really? Yeah. Okay? So, three months go by, I'm still flat broke, and I've barely paid him anything back. So, last week, at my job, two fucking guys come in and tell me if I don't have at least a grand for Tony by Saturday night, they're gonna break my fuckin' legs. And I like my legs. I use them when I walk. I don't want them broken. But to make things worse... actually, it's not that big of a deal, now that I think about it, because my friend Billy owes me a grand. Right? So, I tell him and Tony to meet me at the club last night. Of course, when I get there, Billy's nowhere to be seen, but that's no big deal, I'm understandably a little tense. But it's okay, 'cause I've got this great backup plan where I'm just gonna borrow money from everyone that I know. Ha ha! And I'm working it, too. I'm totally working it. But the thing is, since my backup plan is turning into my full-frontal plan, everywhere I turn, all I'm getting is... No. No. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Some dude told me to blow him, which was incredibly excessive. I didn't want to do it. No. nein. No. Fucking no here, no there, everywhere. No, no! Your... your... you've got, like, small balls probably. No. No. Uh-mm-mm-uh. I mean, everywhere I look, it's... No. No. No. No. I'm sorry. Get off your knees. I can't even get over on Ryan, who fucks me off not once... But twice! Where am I gonna get $200? 50. I hustle the entire night. All I manage to pull is a 50. Ha! And I'm walking out, totally pissed off, when who do I see walking into the club? It's Tony fucking Russo, right? He's talking to Cassie, probably asking where I am. She probably told him. Bitch. Anyway, so I fuckin' bolt. I'm booking a retreat for the back door. Who do I run into? Billy! Yo. Oh, thank god. Hey, sorry I'm late. No, it's okay. It's okay. It's good. It's great. I just... i need my $1,000 like now. I don't have it. What?! Look, I got US something so much better. Check this out. This is a new top-secret drug developed by some huge drug company. Nobody knows what it does, but it's supposed to be mind-blowing. So, you took... you took my money and you spent it... spent it on drugs? Yeah, but we're gonna make so much more than $1,000. We're gonna give out a few samples, get people psyched to hook up. Look at me! I am not selling fucking drugs! Fine. Yeah. Chill out. Comprende? All right? It's fine. Yeah. Just give me a minute. Zeke! Come here. What's up? Go wait for me at the bar. I got a job for you. Cool. Taken care of. Taken care of? Yeah, Zeke will do the legwork, you and I will sit back... son of a bitch! Doesn't have it! That's right. Doesn't fuckin' have it. So, I end up crashing at this 6th street squat 'cause I'm too fuckin' afraid to go home. Finally, when I get up the courage, I'm driving like a lion back to my apartment to sell some cds, when who do I bump into? Man: Hey! We're not here for you, man. Fuck no, man. I finally tagged Billy on his cell phone to see if he's made US any money. He says no, 'cause apparently that "drug" that was supposed to make US all the money isn't even a drug. It's some fuckin' chemical designed by the U.S. army so that soldiers look like they're dead, so they don't get taken in wars, like, p.O.W.S. Whatever, right? So, this has been my whole fuckin' night, and at the end of it, I'm still flat fuckin' broke, and I need $1,000 now! You know what? I don't get you. What? What's not to get? I'm fucked! The cat's out of the bag, mate. We all know you're pulling the George orwell. What? Come on. Your father owns a massive software company. Okay... don't even try and argue. I know it's true. And I'm watching you sweat and moan over 10 grand, which I know you could pay off in a single bloody second. So, what could possibly be stopping you? I cannot do it that way. Why not? You have one life, mate. Exactly! That's the point, Mick. Okay. Look, like, I want to feel everything. But you can't have everything without nothing. I mean, you can't have nothing without everything. It's like siddhartha, you know what I mean? And that's what was so great about orwell, because he fuckin' suffered! I mean, he had it all, and he threw it all away and did it on his own... Jesus effing Christ. You know what? I listen to all my friends, and I don't get the one of you. You're all neurotic, bitching, worried and insecure. Mate, what the hell for? We are 23 years old. We don't have wives, we don't have kids, we don't own anything that owns US. For god's sake, we barely have jobs. And we are here. This is the greatest time of our lives. You should do what I do. Yeah, what's that? Do what you want. Do what you feel. Trust the universe. And when you do... trust me... it will all work out. Oh. Right. Well, I'm sure your night was just fuckin' fabulous. Actually it was. Of course. So, I'm at the club. Everything's tip-top and I'm about to settle into my first Martini, when I see this very attractive woman... Sarah. She seems upset, so I walk over and introduce myself. Hey. My name's Mick. Hi. Sarah. Mick: She's very sweet and terribly embarrassed because she's been trapped in this unhealthy obsession with Ryan and wants to talk it over. I've been to, like, every single one of his shows... So I listen to her... I always wait by his car because I know what kind of car he drives. Buy her a round or two... You're so sweet when you talk to me. Cheer her up... And the next thing I know... [Music playing] ♪ Everybody makes mistakes ♪ [Unzips] ♪ But I feel all right ♪ ♪ when I come undone ♪ Come on. Are you fucking kidding me? No. Afterwards, she's tired, so I get her number and agree to call her later in the week. So, I drop her off, but I'm not ready for the night to end. So, I head back to the club for one more drink. Now, I'm sitting at the bar, nursing a scotch... Girl: That fuck! I'm gonna do exactly to him what he does to me.

Then I drove to the spa, sauna'd, showered, and came straight here. Actually, you probably know who it is. It's that girl from that TV show. Um... Texas high. Mick! Do you have any idea who her husband is? Ryan told me this morning. It's a bit of bad luck, that. [British accent] "A bit of bad luck!" Yeah, yeah. Big bad luck, okay? You fucking slept with Tony Russo's wife. I didn't know it at the time, mate. I've been sitting here, telling you this story for an hour, and you're fucking his wife? Are you fucking kidding me? God damn you. You know what? I can't be seen with you. Trust the universe. Fuck you, fuck the universe! I'm out! The truth is the truth, mate. We all just play our small part in it. Well, I'll play my part. I'll be in Mexico, you'll be fucking dead. Open your eyes. You're next. Is this you... With my wife on this thing? All right, mate. I had no idea she was your wife. As far as I knew, she was a bird playing some game with some anonymous husband. And I never would've touched her if I'd known her husband was you. But there she was... In a bar, drunk and alone, ready to shag without exchanging a single word, and utterly, stunningly beautiful. Now, I believe that any man who can hold a gun on me the way you are probably understands exactly what I'm saying, and has maybe even done the exact same thing himself. But if you haven't, or if you don't, or if you don't want to admit that you have, or you do, or you're just a sadistic fuck who puts no value on human life, then shoot me. 'Cause the fact is, I can't stop you. But I hope that first you'll consider whether or not it's worth the risk, especially since you and I both know that I have fuck all to do with what's going on between you and your wife. Are you finished? Mm-hm. [Gunshot, glass breaks] [Laughing] I scare you? [Laughs] I scared you, didn't I? You want to know what's going on between me and my wife? I've been looking for an excuse to divorce that bitch for three years. And this is exactly what I need. So, I owe you... Big time. You ever need a favor... and I mean anything... you get a hold of me. It's yours. Actually, there is one thing. You see my friend? He owes you ten grand. I was hoping you might cancel the debt. [Mouthing] Done. [Sighs] Loyalty. I like that. See? It all works out. Hi. Hi. I've been looking for you. Can we talk? You want to go on the roof? Yeah. I'll grab my coat. Is Tony Russo gonna make you famous? You were right. He's a scumbag. I'm sorry. So, whatever happened with you and apple? Cassie, that was not supposed to happen that way. It's all right. Apple is amazing. She is. That's so obvious. I mean... Cassie. Cassie. She's not you. I'm not... Me. Not the me that's in your head, Ryan. That's not true, Cassie. Yes, it is. It's true. I don't know how to say it. I'm not done failing yet. I like my failures. They make me who I am. Friends? Friends, yeah.

I should probably get these contracts to Derek, so I'll see you... I'm right here. All right, gather round, everybody. [Clears throat] Before we open our doors again, I'd like to make one thing very clear. Last night was a fuckin' disaster. You people are disorganized, pathetic, and I don't even want to think about what happened in my office. But... Because of you and your promotions, we've made this the hottest spot in town for the next five minutes. Or until I sell it. Or until the cops find a reason to shut US down. Whichever comes first. So, people... please try and remember not to take this time for granted. Because you are here. And trust me when I tell you this... that you will never be this young, this cool, this careless, or this carefree ever again. And if you thought last night was hot, fuck that. You're gonna make tonight even hotter. 'Cause this is life, people. And here we go again.
