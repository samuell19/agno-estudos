Who's Jenny? Ha, Jenny. Jenny is the booker at the airline, that's who she is! She's the one who books my trips! She's the one who helps me make money, that's who she is! Really, that's why you have to call her? Of course I have to call her! - Times a week! - Of course I have to call her! You're... you're switching your ticket that many times?! I'm not switching my ticket, I'm flying the dang plane! I'm not switching any ticket! Don't go, my head... My headache is too bad! You need to go. Uh, I paid for this, so you could go, so you could get better! Robert, my migraines! Oh, come on! What is wrong with you? I have to work! Come on! I followed her back to her house! Come on! I don't think that... I don't think that you'd want to know who that was! - I just told you! - What did you do? It's a little Asian bitch! That's my divorce lawyer, Nancy! What?- - My divorce lawyer! - Your what? That's right, my divorce lawyer, that's who it is! Casey, please, hey... Hey, I'm so sorry. Mommy... I'm so sorry sweet... Guess what, honey? She's not anymore. What? What are you doing? She is not your divorce attorney anymore! Why? Stop! You're scaring Casey! Ha. What did you do, Nancy? - Oh. - Tell me, what did you do? - Oop! - Oh come on. Don't! Stop it! Yes, I... I need an ambulance. No, it's my wife, she's unconscious. I don't know, please hurry. Nancy, please. Please, hurry. Oh my, what a beautiful house. I can't wait to see what's inside. Grandma! You! Oh! Did you get me any presents? Lydia! So empowered. Go get the pizza out of the car. - Pizza! - That's your present. Grandma, you have to see this. Look. Looks like we have another scientist in the family. Sweetie, where's Casey? She's been in her room for hours. - She's not watching you? - I'm watching myself. She's such a big girl. - Isn't that cool? - Mm. Casey? Casey? What? Come say hi to grandma. You mean your mother? Whatever makes you comfortable. Come on, let's go eat, as a family. She had a solo in her dance recital. Everyone was watching only me. It was awesome. That's great. Aw, that's great. Aw, I'm proud of you. Thank you. Mom, when is Robert coming home? My dad's coming home tomorrow. I wish he didn't have to travel so much. Yet, he's a pilot. I do too, Lydia. Oh, you know, I think my mom did too. I think it drove her mad. - Casey. - What? You know, you're such a... A pretty girl. Why do you wear all that dark makeup? It... it hides your pretty face. Oh, that's just because it's not World War II and I can wear whatever I want. Okay, Casey, come on. I appreciate the flowers, dear. Anything to brighten this place up. It ain't exactly the Ritz Carlton. Oh, Mom, it's not that bad. Oh, you know, I think they are putting something in my food. Mom, they're good people here. Ooh, that's what they always say about, uh, serial killers. My, he seemed like such a nice man. Oh... oh... oh... oh... oh. Before I forget, I have something for you. My will, in case anything happens to me. Oh, Mom, nothing's gonna happen to you. I don't think this is legal. - Hmm? - You need a witness. I had the man across the hall witness it. See? Um, half this stuff you gave away years ago. No, I didn't. Unh-unh. I hid it. Okay. Well, that's fine. Skyla and I will take care of it. No... no, uh, let me take care of you. You've always taken care of me. Yes, that's just what I'll do. Ooh, well, uh, well, I'll get out my good china and we'll celebrate taking care of my little girl. That's what I'll do. Hey sweetie, grab yourself some breakfast. Here you go. Hello. How is the most beautiful, smartest, and talented biochemist in the world? Late. Everything okay? Sure is, I'm married to the woman of my dreams. Well, if the woman of your dreams has coffee stains... No, wait, potassium permanganate stains on her shirt, then I'm your girl. You still coming home tonight? I miss you. I sure am. I got you a surprise. Ooh. What'd you get me? It's a surprise. I like surprises. I know, that is why I love you so much. You're so sweet, but we're late. I've gotta drop the girls off at school and get to work. Okay. I love you, see you soon. You too. You ready, Casey? I've got breakfast for you downstairs. Wow, you shouldn't have. Casey, come on, I've got a lot to get done today, you could help. You're right, I'm sorry. Hey, I paid for that. So go pay for another one. Oh, man, look at that tool. Hey, stop shooting the girls! Hi. You're new. I'm aware. What's this? A camera. I know that. Looks expensive. I guess, if you pay for it. Where you from? Seattle, basically. Seattle, basically? What's that about? A lot of rain, I guess. Can I have my camera back? No. You're not a perv are you? No. No. Kind of. Me too, kind of. How's family life? I wish Robert was in town more. Mm-mm, I'll bet you do. - You have a one track mind. - Guilty as charged. You know, I just feel like we never had that honeymoon period. We're always trying to balance time with the girls. How's it going with Casey? Not well, not so sure we're bonding. Well, you just moved into her home. It's natural for her to be territorial. Plus, she's probably on drugs. Oh, wow, that came out of nowhere. Yeah, I'm usually three steps ahead of everyone else. Casey doesn't seem like the type. Girlfriend, she's a teenager, she's the type. You should've seen me at 16, I was like a walking Phish concert. Just be aware of the signs. Get out. I'm not here to judge. I just said, get out. We need to talk. You know, I understand feeling angry at your age. My mom and I put each other through hell. She was not stable and it was pretty bad. You know, I basically took care of my mom and sister. Yeah? What happened next? That's complicated. Right. Anyway, I find it's easier if we're just honest with each other. Yeah. So if you're gonna be experimenting with stuff, then I understand where it's coming from but you have to understand that there are gonna be consequences. Yeah... yeah, for sure. What kind of consequences? Just curious. I would have to discuss that with your father. The consequences? Look, I'm not gonna get into semantics, Casey. We're not doing anything that's gonna harm your future, period. And you know, you could lighten up a little on the attitude. God, Jill, you're such a good mother. Don't test me, Casey. Everything okay in here? Hey, Dad. Everything's awesome. We're just having some super fun girl bonding time. Right, Jill? Great. Hey, Dad? Are you gonna read me a story? - Shall we? - Yeah. Are we good? Yeah, we're great. Okay. - Dad! - Yeah. Can you close the door? Yeah. - What's the prince's name? - Prince Charming. That's not a real last name. I think it's poetic license. Why are her stepsisters so mean? They weren't happy in their own hearts, so they took it out on her. Too serious. Someone say something funny. You like? Have I told you how much I love you? You look beautiful. I have missed you. I missed you, too. How was Miami? It was okay. I went fishing out by the Key's. Yeah, you catch this off a mermaid? No. I got it from a little Cuban shop, down the street from my hotel. Hey, how was everything back here? We're still... adjusting. It's okay. I'll talk to Casey. I know what she's going through. Having a mother like that. Not knowing what it means for you. What happened with Casey's mom? I told you. It was bad. We had a big fight and then I filed for divorce. She got custody. How many years did Casey spend with that woman? Five long years. I'm gonna help her, Robert. So your parents are divorced, too? Yeah. That's too bad. I guess. Do you ever miss your dad? Eh, what's to miss? He was mean a lot except for when we were working on photos together. My mom likes to talk about him, but I really don't see the point. - What? - Nothing. You're not like all the other girls. You're different. Well, we're both different. Victor, what are you doing? You know, we got a new rule around here. Creeps who like to take pictures of our girls get to experience the golden shower. Oh, are you serious?! - Come on. - Stop it! Creep. Victor, stop! That's not funny! I was talking to him! Great. Hey, where you heading? To class. Like your shirt. Something I said? My shirt, Brad? Really, Brad? You like my shirt? What do you like, that it's see-through and you can take pictures and post on the internet? Whoa, is this about this morning, with the football players? Yeah, it is. You let them walk all over you. Well, I'm the new guy and whatever, it's okay. They're just fooling around. That's pathetic. - Look, there was two of them. - I can count. Well... What do you suggest I do? How'd you get that in there? You don't want to know. Is it recording? - Is now. - Good. Casey, why don't you ever call me back? I mean, why flirt with me and then hang out with that toolbox? It's not cool to tell someone you love them and then ignore them. Did you love me? Yes, I loved you. I still do. What do I have to do to prove that? You know what, Vic, you're an idiot. You're so stupid. You walk around all the time like you think you're so great, but nobody actually likes you. Everyone just feels bad for you, it's pathetic. Casey, how could you say that? You said you loved me. I guess I lied. Casey? Casey?! Ugh, idiot. Hey, I didn't know you were home. Well, I am. I thought that, uh, maybe we could go do something fun together. Fun? Yeah, like, girls night. Um... I think I'll pass on that one. Thank you. Whatever. It's none of your business. - What's in it? - It's none of your business! What do you want me to go around in your room and start looking through your stuff, asking a million questions? Casey, you can try and drive me away all you want but I'm here to stay. I lived through a crazy mother and a wild sister and I don't give up. Hey. Hey, look what I made you. Oh, thanks. Can you put it on me? Sure. Come here. Mom, look what Casey made me. Wow, that's so cool, I love it. Thanks for helping out. You're welcome. Hello. That can't be. What's wrong? It's my mother. I'm sorry, Jill. She's gone. Excuse me. Whoa, whoa, hey, let me do this. Does everything look okay? Yeah, it looks great. Your mother would've loved this. Hey, I'm not gonna ask you if you're okay again. I know you're getting sick of it. Just happened so suddenly. You know, she was doing fine the last time I saw her. She wasn't dying. We go when we go. - I look horrible. - You do not look horrible. Where do you think you're going? And who is he? Dad, Brad. Brad, Dad. Why aren't you dressed for the service? 'Cause I'm not going to the service. And where would you be going? We're going out, it's none of your business. You're not leaving the house. We are, good-bye. Have fun. Casey! Casey! Get your ass back here. This has nothing to do with me. Yes, it does, we're a family. This is your family. Who is that? That's your Aunt Skyla. I need a drink. Really? Hello, everyone. Is this Lydia? She's so different from the picture. Those were baby pictures. Oh, hi. - Hello, Skyla. - Hello. - This is my husband, Robert. - Hello. - Hi. - It's twice in Europe. This is my daughter Casey. Ooh, I love your outfit. Thank you. Where's the open bar? I'm sorry I couldn't get here earlier. Modeling is slavery. Okay, we're gonna go. Ditching party already? No, she isn't. Come on, let her blow off some steam. Let's go see mama. Casey, let's go. Hey, just, um, I just need to say hi to someone real quick, okay? Hi, have you seen this yet? You said you loved me. You should just show it... Everything all right? Um, yeah, it's about to be. Is she still not answering? Straight to voicemail. I'm sorry, Robert. Casey has to learn that the world doesn't live and die based on her needs. - How are you feeling? - I'm really hot. Don't! Just be in the moment, don't look. I won't, I wasn't. Feel my back, am I sweating? Uh... It's okay, you don't have to feel my back. No, I do, I want to. Brad, you gotta be a man sometime. If you want something, you just take it. Take it, yeah. Oh, my God, I love you so much. What? Nice vest. That come with a sword or a pirate hat? Hey Vic, did you get a chance to meet all your adoring fans? What are you talking about? Oh, sorry, how rude. Casey, how could you say that? You said you loved me. Love you so much! You bitch! Really, Victor, which one of us is a bitch right now? Go on, have the slut, I did. Your mom wore some pretty trippy stuff. This isn't hers. It looks like something Casey would wear. I can't sleep. I'm... I'm gonna drive around and look for Casey. I'll go with you. No, stay, Skyla's in no condition to watch Lydia. Plus, it'll... it'll give me time to think. Okay. Be careful. Feel bad about leaving the funeral? Why would I feel bad? 'Cause it's your family. Don't say that. They're not my family. I think family is just a made up idea anyway. I wasn't... sorry. You know, my dad and I were completely fine, just us. And then this complete stranger comes into my life and starts telling me what to do. Everything's gonna be okay. Yeah, everything's gonna be okay. Angel. Angel. Angel. Angel. Angel. Did you see what happened to my mother? Angel. You saw an angel? Angel of death. I thought she was coming after me. She? It was a woman? What did she look like? She... she... What's going on here? Jill. I'm sorry, I... you scared me. He was just telling me that he saw someone in my mother's room the other night. Were there any visitors? Well, not that I know of, but I think you need to take anything Mr. Parker says with a grain of salt. Let's let him rest. Of course. The doctors said my mother had a heart attack. Would it be possible to see her file? Um, I have to clear that with my boss. It's kind of standard procedure, you understand? Of course. Got to do something! Guys, what... what should we do? I don't know... I don't know what to do. Guys, come on, get some water. Gotta do something. Guys! He's not breathing! Guys! Someone call 9-1-1, he's not breathing. Hey, he's not breathing! Somebody call 9-1-1! He's not breathing! Someone call 9-1-1! Guys, come on, get some water! Victor, come on! Buddy, come on! Victor! Let's go. - Victor! - No, help! He's not breathing. Someone do something. - Victor! - Come on! I'm sorry Mrs. Burris, I'm afraid I can't help you. But she's my mother, I'm allowed to see her file. It's too early in the administrative process. I can mail you one in three weeks. Three weeks? She's already been cremated. You still need authority to expedite an autopsy report. Does it help that I'm a lab technician? Nope. Not in any way, whatsoever. Does it help that I'm a lab technician who hires other lab technicians? Competitive pay, good health benefits, no dead people. I'll be right back. Thank you. What are you looking for? Cause of death. You don't think she was murdered, do you? Seems paranoid. Everything good? It says she died of a heart attack. Nothing out of the ordinary? No. Do you mind if I make a photocopy of this? When did you get home? Does it matter? Yes, it matters. Your father was worried sick. What about you? Were you worried sick? Casey, don't start. I'm a free person. It's not against the law to spend the night somewhere else. You are not a free person. You're a minor and what you did was dangerous. I guess I was just freaked out about grandma. Hello, party people. Hi. I need a drink. I need a drink. What did I miss? Casey disappeared for two days. Okay, looks like you have your hands full. So excuse me. Maybe she just needed some fresh air and, you know, get away from all of the structure. - She's 16. - There is that. And some people need structure. Right. We can't all be perfect, can we? Okay, Skyla, you can stay, but can you please cut back on the drinking in front of the girls, please? Happiness skips a generation. Oh, Jesus Christ, Skyla! Can you cut me some slack? I mean, just for once! Okay. Where did that come from? Did you ever... Did you ever see mom in me? What do you mean by that? Her, um, instability. You mean her crazy? Jill, if there is anybody, it's me. Look, I'm not a shrink. But you seem a little bit tightly wound. You never actually took time to unwind. You know, sis, unwind. Thank you. I'm glad you're here. Your attitude this week has been unacceptable. Casey, we've talked about trust. And it's obviously not sinking in. I'm not gonna drag this out any further. You're grounded. - I'm grounded? - Yes. Okay, how long? For a week. Okay, I guess that's fair. Look, guys, um, I'm really sorry. Jill and I are gonna go out for a while. Okay. So if the babysitter tells us you left this house, we're gonna revisit this punishment. Wait, Dad, you don't need to get a babysitter. I can take care of Lydia, I'm completely responsible. Just give me another chance, I'll be fine. I'll be good, I promise. Fine, we accept your offer. I expect you to be taking care of her. I will, I promise. We're gonna play a game. Thank you, I needed this. Your... your strength amazes me, Jill. You're taking care of everyone... Oh... and dealing with loss at the same time. And making a fool of myself. Don't be ridiculous. No, I thought I'd have 10 more years with her and now she's just gone. I mean, I wish I could've just told her I was sorry. She knew. She loved you, Jill. I know. Thank you. Thank you, I... I pull myself together before people start thinking I'm a nut case. It's my fault. I haven't been here. Casey has been a grade A headache for you. The thing is, Casey's always been different. Different, like how? She... she didn't talk for about a year. And she wouldn't eat. She wouldn't go to school. And after a while, she just had to go away. To an institution? Yeah. I know... I know that she screwed up, Jill. I really wanna give her a second chance in life. Me too. Thank you. I can't do this without you. We're a family, we'll get through this. Yeah. I can't find the last piece we need for the brick house. Hey, Lydia, do you ever miss your dad? Sometimes. He lives in New York. Have you ever been there? He never wants to come visit you? I don't know. Mom says he's busy. Do you believe her? My mom never lies. Come on, she's gotta lie about something. Not my mom. Everybody lies, Lydia. What do you lie about? My whole life is a lie. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. Hey, look at that. I found the last piece. Huh? But... Now all the little piggies can be safe. And they all have their home now. That was the piece I was looking for. That's weird. I guess I had it in my hand the whole time. Oops. This is nuts. Didn't you say your stepdaughter went to one of these recently? - One of what? - A rave. I know that boy. He dated Casey for a while. Well, thank God that isn't a photo of her. The drugs they've got flowing around at those things... It doesn't say he OD'd. Oh, come on, 18-year-old athlete dies at a rave, what else would it be? Breakfast? Mm, I don't think I can eat food. You have to eat, it's how you start your metabolism. My metabolism has a hangover. Well, I guess, we're just gonna have to force feed you then, huh? Yeah. That's good. What did you make? Okay, um, I made some eggs and some s... Well, I haven't made the sausage yet but I will and some hot tea. Mm, you're quite a chef. Well, I've been practicing, kind of, have a new boyfriend. Ooh, that guy from the funeral? Yeah, his name's Brad. He just moved here from Seattle. Hmm. Um, will you hand me that knife over there? The one... no, the one on top. Yeah, that one. Ooh, careful, it's sharp. Where's Skyla? What? Skyla, where is she? She's dead. What did you say? I buried her alive. Casey, not funny. Jill, I'm not trying to be funny. - What did you do? - Oww! You can't just grab my arm like that. Jill? What's the commotion? What's the problem? You actually thought that I did that? I think you might be as crazy as your mother. Is everything okay? Yeah. Get out! Get out of my room! - Casey! - Get out! The games you're playing are unacceptable. You're grounded until further notice. No more going out at night. No more Brad, no more parties. Fine, whatever, I don't care! The last one was dead anyways. - Wasn't he your boyfriend? - Yeah, for like a second. Now, can you please get out of my room! You're invading my privacy! Well, have some respect. What's the matter with you? I mean, what 16-year-old needs a safe? What am I gonna find in there, huh, Casey? Don't touch it, it's mine! You can't touch my things! It's none of your business! Hey, what's going on in here? Nothing, everything's wonderful, why? I was just wondering, um, don't forget we have that appointment with the lawyer. Did you really think that she was serious about murdering me? Well, I don't know what to think anymore. Jill, I hate to say this but you're sounding a little bit crazy. Mom died, that boy she dated died and she's had serious issues. People die, Jill. You're her step mom. All you can do is to hug her until she stops throwing punches. Okay, well, Skyla, no offense, but you're not exactly one to be giving out parenting advice. You wanna score points, great, you win. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... Oh, whatever. Sorry about that, just finishing up a call. Come on in. Okay, let's see here. Uh, your mother, Mrs. Teresa Norran, has significant healthcare costs. But she did have some money left over. According to her will, she left $130,000 to a Skyla Norran and... And, uh, that's it. Wait... I'm sorry, that can't be. No offense, I... Um- - Well, that's... that's all it says about money. Down here, she does add, "Skyla has lived the type of life that I had dreamed of for my daughters. She's a beautiful, smart, vivacious woman who lives life to its fullest. My only wish is that my daughter Jill someday feels the energy and freedom that her sister has." Uh, that's typed. Is that unusual? My mother showed me her will a few days ago. It was handwritten and, frankly, a little erratic. Are you suggesting that she didn't write it? Uh, well, I don't know what to say, Mrs. Burris. It was found at her bedside and it clearly supersedes all other wills. Tell me, is, uh, Is that her signature? Yep. Yes. She never used computers. Well, maybe one of the nurses typed it. Why would she leave money to only one of us? I don't know, maybe she thought that you and Robert were already established. No, you think Casey did something? Look, I never told you this but I found one of Casey's necklaces in mom's room. So? So, what reason in the world would Casey have to go visit our mom? Maybe she just wanted to be polite. I found out that that kid Victor was also wearing that necklace before he died. Victor used to be Casey's boyfriend. I mean, she has a thing about that necklace. What if she went into mom's room... Okay, now you officially sounding like crazy mom. Our anniversary. Melarsoprol? What are you doing? Uh, you're home. I didn't want to do this. I... but I'm worried about Casey. What the hell is she doing in my room? Watch your language. You have no right to be in here. You gave up all rights to privacy when you disappeared for two days. Look, I know what's going on, Casey. You don't know anything. You're never even home. Look, that's not fair. I know exactly... You don't know anything! You know what she tells you! What are you doing in my room? Probably looking for the drugs that you're on. So what is it Casey? What are we gonna find in the safe? This is crazy. She's insane! Get out of my room! Calm down, Casey. Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Out, get out! Get out! Casey, it's all... Get out! Don't touch me! I hate you! Get out! Get out! Get out! Casey! Get out! Get out, please! - Calm down. - Please, get out. What'd you find? It's called Melarsoprol. "The drug can be used as a cure for trypanosomiasis. Also known as the African sleeping sickness." "It is highly dangerous. And if abused, can have the same effect as arsenic poisoning in humans." "Can lead to nausea, fever, convulsions, loss of consciousness and death." You don't really think Casey used this on your mother. I thought it was a heart attack. Well, the coroner had barely checked her out. I mean, he looked at her age and said, cardiac arrest. So what are you gonna do? I need to order a tissue sample. She was cremated. True, but she was also an organ donor. Melarsoprol. You are ridiculous. That's horrible. And then he goes like, da, da, da! Oh my goodness. - He was just... - Ooh, a new girl. Hi, gorgeous. You're going? Yeah, I have to leave. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too, Tina. Bye. - Bye. - Thanks. You should've seen us together in Europe. And I'm surprised we're still alive. Wow, sounds crazy. When did you move to Europe? Um, I got invited for modeling career when I was 14. And trust me, as soon as I could get out of here, I did. Are you celebrating something? Yep, I recently came into some money. No kidding. Good for you. Mom left everything to me. Really? You should've seen Jill. She was a little ticked by it. Of course I'm gonna split it all with her. Of course. After I buy a few things. I don't know if you've thought about this but... I don't know if you should split it with her. That would kind of be denying gramms her last dying wish. I don't know if you'd want to do that. Hear, hear. You want a sip? Of the champagne? - Yeah. - Okay. Of course, just don't tell my sister. I wouldn't dare tell her. Mm, nice. So why is she so strict all the time anyway? Well, let's just say that some people like to control everything. Has she been doing that to your whole life? When our dad died, it was sort of me, mom and Jill and when she wasn't at school, she would come home and boss us around. And that's why I left and never came back till now. That's no good. - That sucks. - Yeah, that does suck. Definitely. So, what happened to her with her ex-husband, with Lydia's dad? Did they just fight all the time or... Is that what she told you? No, they had some problems, but that's not why they broke up. Why'd they break up? Okay, I'll tell you, but you can't repeat a word. I wouldn't dare. Mom, what's going to happen to us? What do you mean? If you and Robert got a divorce. Why would you say that? Because you and Casey are always fighting. Oh, sweetie, that has nothing to do with Robert and I. Do you think she'd ever hurt us? Why? Has she done something to you? Just curious. Lydia, nothing bad will ever happen to you. Not as long as I'm around. Got it? Got it. Okay, come on. Come on. Oh, my God. Skyla, what are you doing? Oh, we're celebrating. With alcohol. - Shh. - Shh. All right, that's it. Pack your bags, you're leaving. You never told me that your ex-husband cheated on you. He didn't exactly cheat, did he, Jill? I mean, she caught him making out in the corner of a business event. But, this Ms. Perfect here, she couldn't stand the thought of dust under her bed. Lydia, go to your room. Oh, here comes superhero mom. She's here to protect the innocent. Okay, Lydia, go to your room now. Casey, you too, now. Let's go! Okay. Stepping in your... Give me that. Get... go! Mm, what? What do you mean, what? You're drinking with a teenager. How dare you talk about me in front of the girls. I'm in mourning. I'm allowed to be upset. You know, you... I'm calling you a cab. You're going to a hotel. I don't need a cab. I'll drive my own car. I said I don't need a... What the hell is wrong with you?! Are you... are you out of your mind?! Oh, it's you, you are out of your mind. I mean, your pathetic thoughts of family. Having this perfect house, perfect daughter, perfect husband. But you're no better than anyone else. You're drunk. You're just jealous that mom loved me more. It's called living, Jill, try it sometime. Mom was sick! She wasn't sick! She was mentally ill and stop apologizing for her! Stop stuffing your feelings down! How do you think I get by? I have two kids to take care of since I was a kid, you and mom! You don't think I wanted to go out and get wild? Stop martyring yourself. It didn't help our family and it's not gonna help this one either. You can hate me all you want but you can't fix anything, you never could. Get out of my house. If this what family means, I don't wanna be a part of it. I'm back. Oh, not again. I don't think so. Question for you. How do I get a tissue sample? A tissue sample? Yes, my mother was an organ donor and I need to track down a sample. It's very important. Oh, is that all? I need to check it for poison. You need to speak to a detective about that. - I can't go to a detective. - Why not? Because, if I'm wrong, it could ruin my family. Look, this is a real emergency. Mm-hmm, well, I don't know what to tell you, okay? Naomi, I've got a favor to ask. - Okay, here we go. - Yeah. - One, good. - Yeah. All right. Let's... get closer, here we go. All right, what do you think of that? - Okay. - You like that? - Looks great. - That's okay? Now, uh, okay, put your arms... yeah, just touch me a little bit, not too much. - Uh, oh, okay, all right. - That's too much, okay. A little. Right there? There, that's good. Yeah, one hand... one hand. There we go. Aah! We're getting closer. - You like that? - That's great. Okay, good. Good, okay. Put your arms, yeah, just touch me a little. - Not too much, that's too much. - Right there? There, that's good, yeah, one hand, there we go. Aah! All right, you know what? Move back, I got this. Okay. Okay, we're gonna do a... There we go. We're gonna get some... Oh, yeah, we got the whole body, right there. What do you think of that? Oh, like it. That's good. Now, you getting it... okay. And then we'll have, yeah. Yeah, like we're like at the beach or something. - All right. - Aah! - Ah, that was a good one. - Yeah. - Like that one? - Yeah. - Okay, that one. - Yes. Not that, you can see up my skirt, I think. Oh, my gosh, that is hilarious. Oh, jeez. Naomi, you need to take a look at this. What am I looking at? Positive for arsenic. My mother was poisoned. And I'm betting that boy, Victor, was as well. Why wasn't it in the autopsy? It's hard to detect unless you're looking for it. Oh, God, I have to go. Run the test on that boy Victor. We'll need verification. Okay. How can I direct your call? I need to speak to someone, a detective or a supervisor. All officers are in the field. Would you like to leave a message? No... no... no, that's fine, I'll call back. Is Lydia here? Uh, you just missed her. Her sister just picked her up. Casey picked her up? Yeah, she's on the list of people who can come get her. Only when she's with me. She has a driving permit, not a license. Um, she wasn't driving. A young man was. Hey, babe, I was just thinking about you. Robert, I need you to listen to me very carefully. I think something bad has happened to Lydia. She all right? She... I think... I think Casey has her. Hold on, can you say that again? You're breaking up. Casey has her... Casey has Lydia. I think she's gonna kill her. Whoa, whoa, whoa, I... Casey's got some issues but, uh, she wouldn't kill anyone. You have to trust me on this Robert. Casey and that boy from school picked Lydia up without my permission. Okay? And my mother was poisoned, arsenic, the same kind I found in Casey's safe. We don't have time to give her the benefit of the doubt anymore. - Where are you? - I'm heading home. If you get there and no one's there, you call 9-1-1, okay, and set up an Amber Alert. If Lydia's in danger, I am not gonna sit on my hands. Jill, let the authorities help. Every... everything's gonna be okay. Lydia! Are you in here?! Hi, Jill. Where is my daughter? What are you talking about, I'm right here. Where's Lydia? Oh, your other daughter? Not your stepdaughter. Look, Casey, it can still be okay. You're father told me how bad it was with your mom. All the pain that you went through. No one wants you to be in pain. No one wants to take your father away from you. Okay, just tell me where my daughter is. There you go again, Jill. Trying to protect everyone. Think you already failed once, didn't you? I saw what was in the safe. I can prove you killed my mother. I don't really think that matters now. You know, she was really surprised to see me that night. She asked me all these questions before I wrapped my arms around her and slid a needle into her arm. I think she wanted it. She was a really restless soul. God damn you, Casey, where is Lydia? Where's my daughter? No more games! The games are just beginning. Casey? It's Robert, what the hell's going on over there? Why aren't you picking up? Casey just Skype'd me. She has Lydia tied up. - Where are they now? - I don't know. Wait, wait, they're here in some kind of forest from when she was little. The Angeles National Forest? I'm on my way. I'm gonna call 9-1-1 and I will meet you there. Hi, did you have a good nap? I really... I had a bad dream. What was your dream about? I dreamed that I was in the woods. And you left me there. I tried to find my way back home, but I got lost. Then a wolf started chasing me. But before you got me, I woke up. Sounds like you had a nightmare. I left something in the car. Can you untie me and I'll go get it? I'll get it for you. What is it? My water bottle with the pink top. I think we have a little bit of time. I'll go get it for you. And are we done playing with the rope? Actually we're gonna need that for when mommy comes. Hey, it's Casey, leave a mess... Hey, it's Casey, leave a message or whatever. What are we doing? - What do you mean? - With Lydia. I thought we were getting you and your stepsister out of an abusive situation. Is Jill telling the truth? Did you really kill her mother? Well, kind of, yeah. That's insane. Yeah, it's really not, though, Brad, because I'm not related to them. Okay. I don't share any blood with them. For all I care, they could just be from another planet. What about Victor? Did you kill him too? Victor was messing with your courage. And I need that now. You know this is crazy, right? Now we have your sister tied up. We're going to go to prison. My God, we're not gonna go to prison. We're minors. The worst that's gonna happen is we get locked up for two years. Then we have to take some stupid psych test and then we're out on the streets at 18. You don't need to be so dramatic about everything. It's easy for you to say. You go to a girls prison. I either join a gang or I'm gonna get raped. Never know, you could get raped outside of prison, too. Look, Brad, just listen to me, okay. Suck it up. I need you now. Be my hero, okay? Let's just finish my plan and then when this is all over, it'll just be you and me, okay? Then we can go wherever you want. Anywhere you want. And I'll be yours forever. This is gonna set us free. You know, we're not blood related. What? You and I, we don't share blood. I'm the crazy one, remember? Let's just leave the obsessing to me. - I need the police. - Please hold. - No, I can't hold. - Is this Jill Burris? - Yes, this is Jill Burris. - What is your emergency? My daughter has been abducted by my stepdaughter. Send a car, send everyone, Route 126, heading west towards the park. Brad... Where's Lydia? She was right here. I know she was right here! But she's not here now. Where is she? Jesus, Brad, I told it wasn't tight enough! She's seven years old. How tight is a knot supposed to be? Tight enough so that she can't escape! Let's go get her. Come on, this way. Hello, Jill. I'm here. Where's here? The forest, where you used to vacation with your parents, right? I thought you'd figure it out. Aren't you a clever step-mommy. The police are on their way. Casey, it's time to do the right thing. Turn yourself in. Jill... But Lydia and I want to play. We can play at home. Better come quick. There you are. Casey, this is wrong. Come on, Brad. You really think I would date a tool like you if I wasn't getting something out of it? Hand me that gasoline. Now! Casey. What? I want to go home. I'm scared. Sweetie... Look at me. Remember that story about Cinderella? The one where she defeats her evil stepsisters in the end? That's not this story. Please don't hurt me, Casey. Unfortunately, for you, kiddo, this is where things start to escalate a little bit. So you can just save that for daddy. Casey, that's enough. Casey! I said that's enough! - So you can just... - It's okay. I'll say when it's enough. ♫ Frere Jacques ♪ Frere Jacques ♪ Dormez-vous? Casey, stop! Stop! Hello, step-mommy. Let her go. Careful. We've been waiting for you. You need help, Casey. I know that. People have been telling me that ever since I was seven years old. You need help. You need therapy. Maybe I come from a broken family. No one wanted you to be hurt, Casey. Your father and I, we worry about you. But he didn't worry enough to protect me, did he? Because that time was for women like you. And when you came along... It was hate at first sight. God, I hated you. Every laugh, every fake smile, every blatant attempt to win my affection, to better your relationship with him. That was never my intention, Casey. I thought you were so beautiful, when I first met you. All I wanted was a family. A real family. No. No. You stole him from me. You stole him from me! So I stole your mother from you. And now, I'm gonna divorce you from your precious little girl. Mommy. Lydia, it's okay. This can all end here, Casey, without another tragedy. Oh, so you're not mad at me for killing your mother? No. And you're not mad at me for taking your daughter? No. I forgive you, Casey. You forgive me? I want to be your mother, too. I want us to be a family. You deserve to be loved. I've always loved you, Casey. Really, step-mommy? Well, I don't love you! - Jill, where are you? - We're over here. Casey, no! Oh, Casey. Oh... Oh, God. I'm so sorry. You know my friend Kaylie knows how to play the piano. Oh, yeah? Yeah, but her arms are too short. So she can only play the middle parts. Do you want to play the piano? Maybe. Well, I can see about getting you some lessons. Awesome. I think that's a great idea. Need any help? No, I think we're all set. The table looks great. Thank you. Hi. How are you? Good. We're all here. Happy birthday, Grandma. Well, how was your flight? It was great. - Grab some of this. - Okay.
