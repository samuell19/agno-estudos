But the sister was too scared, so the sister... the sister put down her cigarette and she married the sultan. So the archer became a... the archer for the king. So, it was the wedding night, and the sultan and the sister were gonna get married. And so... the archer went out the door, and he had on his armor, and he was going. There was all, like... You know how like the gran... ground was in 16th-century Japan? It was black and green like a chessboard. So the archer was walking on the black part of the chessboard, and he looked at the black part of the chessboard, and it looked like the back of his sister's hair. And so... You know how it is. Yeah. Anyway, it looked... Oh, what a mess. Looked like the back of his sister's hair, and so he couldn't advance and be the king's archer no more, because he looked over at the palace, and over at the palace, he saw his sister undressing for the sultan.

Dylan was all right with it, but Levy told me there was no budget. Because I thought that this was really going to go somewhere, I took all the money that I had, and I paid for everything out of my own pocket. - Did Bob like you? - I don't know, who knows? He was... It was like looking into a mirror. You either saw what you wanted to see, or you hated what you saw.

I think that's what they were expecting. They just thought that I was going to make it a concert film, but I was trying to make something really serious out of this. First, what I wanted to show was musicians working together, making music together. That was them doing their job. That was, you know, that was as if I went to film my father in his shoe store. Focus in on that. What is that, Patti? I seen th... this Rimbaud book, and I saw this picture. I saw this vogue picture, and I thought it looked like you, - and I thought he was a neat guy, y'know? - Yeah? And I thought you were neat, so I used to, like, pretend he was my boyfriend. Or if... Or if you were. You know, it doesn't matter, right? So anyway... What did you say? - What did I say? - Yeah. I gave my thoughts on... He spoke about mental marriage. - When he asked me... - Mental marriage? Uh, Superman takes a piece of coal, and he puts it in his hand, and he starts squeezing it, and squeezing it, and squeezing it, and squeezing it, and then it becomes like a diamond. - It's real hard. - Yeah. And then, like, he drops it on the ground, - on the baseball diamond. - Yeah. And the kids, the kids keep kicking it, the kids keep kicking it. - Yeah. - Then it goes round and round. And after years and years of kids kicking it around, it gets smooth, but it's not... It's just changed. It's still the same crystal, but it's smooth, so it's a crystal ball. So it's sitting there in the middle, the crystal ball is sitting there in the middle of the baseball diamond. - Right. - Okay? Now you can look in. I hated the ristelaars... the, you know, the... the facilitators. You know, the... the people hanging around him. People pretending that they had access, so that they could behave badly. This film was going to show the counterpoint between the... the excesses of the people on the tour and the dissolution of society. - Come on, everybody. - Allen!

An interview? - Sure. - Ah, wh... - How was it, Bob? How was what? What did Bob say about the tour? I never asked him anything because, you know, he wouldn't answer direct questions. Dylan, you're beautiful. Bob! A legend is in town, and it's not just another... rock 'n' roll show. I mean, it's rock 'n' roll, but it's a special event. where rock 'n' roll has four or five legends, this is one of them, and maybe the biggest one at the present time. Not to brag, but Rolling Thunder was kinda my idea, you know. Bob had done that tour with The Band a few years back, and that was super successful, and then Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young were filling 50,000 seats a night. And Zeppelin was huge. I mean, there was money everywhere. You know, all you had to do was bend down, pick it up. So, I had an idea that some kind of revue with Bob would be a gold mine. So I went off and pitched the idea, and a bunch of local promoters were interested. And then by the time I was done, I ended up with 15 headliners. ♪ I'm gonna have to go to college 'Cause you are... ♪ Now you've asked for it! We took a big risk. And, uh, you know, you had to put up the money, get everybody, you know, hotels, catering, cars, all this stuff, buses. And you had to keep all these guys happy and, you know, focused. And so... And that was, you loaded up before you went out on the road. Then you hope you got paid. And you hope the show worked. Did you have any interaction with Bob? The only time I saw Bob was when he was onstage or driving the bus. You know? Bob kept to himself. How did it become "Rolling Thunder Revue"? Well, I asked Bob. He said originally he was gonna call it Montezuma's Revue, but then he said he was home, and he was just kind of trying to think of a name for the tour, when all of a sudden in the sky, he heard, "Boom!" And then, from left to right, punctuating the sky, "Boom, boom, boom, boom!" So he said, "Hey, let's call it 'Rolling Thunder.'" So before we even left, Chesley Millikin, who was on the tour, says, "Bob, you know what 'rolling thunder' means to the Indians?" And he goes, "What, man?" And Chesley goes, "Speaking truth." And then Bob goes, "I'm glad to hear that, man." Of course, later on we found out that Rolling Thunder was actually the code name for, uh, Nixon's bombing of Cambodia. And that Guam, the backup band, was the base that, uh, they took off from. So, who knows what the real story is. This is the leaflet for a concert they're having in town next week. Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Jack Elliott. Right in the Civic Center. You know me, I'm too old for that kind of stuff. Oh, well. - Okay. - So... when did you first hear about Bob? This is like a... a... It sounds like a fairy tale, but all... a lot of the... It doesn't happen continuously for more than a few days at a time, but a lot of my life, I feel like I really am leading a charmed life, because miracles start happening in threes or fours. One thing I could tell you about Ramblin' Jack, he's more of a sailor than a singer. He can tie a bowline, a clove hitch, and he could tie a rolling hitch, all blindfolded. If you're ever on a boat or sailing ship, you would rather have Ramblin' Jack there as a sailor than a singer. ♪ Now, London is a fine town For sailors ♪ ♪ California and back to France, so... ♪ Which would you rather be, the Pilgrims or the Indians? - Pilgrims. - Why the Pilgrims?

We're... as if we're... we're Pilgrims. Pilgrims in the sense of searchers, looking for the, uh, kingdom of a nation with maybe a different intention.

Shocking Blue! ♪ Her weapons were her crystal eyes ♪ ♪ Making every man mad ♪ I'd been filming Shocking Blue. Their song "Venus" was at the top of the charts. - Wow! - And we needed more footage. And at the time, I liked psychedelics. Oh, LSD was my drug of choice. You know, it was trans... transformative. And I filmed a lot of newspeople and things from the TV, like camera right on the TV, like kinescoped, and I cut these serious things, these speeches, with the rock 'n' roll. ♪ A goddess on a mountaintop ♪ ♪ Was burning like a silver flame ♪ ♪ Well, I'm your Venus ♪ - ♪ I'm your fire at your desire ♪ - It was brood en spelen, uh...

It played the local art film circuit, uh, and it started to have a life of its own. Um, later, when I won the Heinrich Greif Award, America came calling. Van Dorp, I hadn't even heard of him before, but, uh, he seemed like an okay guy. I liked his film history. He did some film work at Madame Tussauds Wax Museum. His idea was to, uh, make this film... appear to be like old newsreels we used to see at movie theaters... growing up, which I thought was a splendid idea. Van Dorp, I wanted to tell you something. I thought Sam would be perfect for van Dorp to, uh, collaborate with, because Sam's got that special knowledge of the underworld that van Dorp didn't seem to have a clue about. I think I asked him once, "Sam, how you write all those plays?" And he said... "Man," he said, "it's like I commune with the dead." I said, "Yeah, yeah, uh, you'd have to to write plays like that." And I asked him if he wanted to, uh, write for, uh, this movie that this guy van Dorp was making. And he went to meet with van Dorp, and then he came back, and he said, uh... he didn't know where the guy was coming from, but if I wanted him to do it, he would. So, that's how Sam got involved. I was living in Homestead Valley, California, running a horse boarding farm. It was a little bit unclear what... what exactly he wanted me to do. I was like a screenwriter or writer for hire, you know. So, sure. So, I joined up. I was just kind of there for the ride, basically, and... and as an observer and trying to make sense of something, you know. New England was just experiencing the backbone of that economic fallout, you know, way back then, it was, you know, desolate... Uh, really, really difficult economic times, you know.

I gotta do a story in an hour, and I just need about two or three paragraphs. - Okay. - Are you up? Yeah, sort of. What do you... Why don't you just talk about the music, okay? What do you wanna know? I've never seen you so fuckin' great onstage. I've never seen you so loose. How come? Jesus Christ, you really got me early in the morning, I can't even think. Uh... Well, it's just the element I work best in, you know? You seen those Italian... those Italian troupes that go around in Italy, - those Italian street theaters... - Yeah. The wagon, the wagon troupes, Commedia dell'arte? Yeah, right. This is kind of an extension of that, only musically. - Music Commedia dell'arte? - Yeah. Come on, Red! Riva! - Jane! - Jane! Get it, Merty! If somebody told you Bob Dylan was coming to Providence, you probably wouldn't believe them, but he is, along with Joan Baez, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, and Bob Neuwirth, and it's called the Rolling Thunder Revue at the Providence Civic Center, Tuesday... You'd book the venues, make deals with each of the local promoters, and then you'd show up. And, you know, you'd have a deal for the gate. And, you know, hopefully everything would go out, would go well, and everybody'd make a little money. Hey, man, it wasn't your door and you weren't invited. - Hey, don't yell at me, all right? - Oh, I am yelling at ya. - Okay. - Go get your cop, - so you can get some fuckin' help. - Okay. The overall promoter was a longtime friend of Bob's and a fishmonger. I mean, he never had managed a tour before, let alone one of this size. It's bad for your, uh, high blood pressure. - Yeah, okay. - Bad for your high blood pressure. - Read him some poetry, Allen. - Anything you wanna say... So he was out of his element and underprepared, and he wasn't very well-liked on the tour. Then tell him the ushers left. Tell him... Tell him we're framingit. - Hi, Barry. - Nice. This guy, Barry Imhoff, was his second-in-command, and he'd worked for Bill Graham for years, but just prior to Rolling Thunder had got out on his own and started Zebra Productions. And this was one of, you know, if not exactly, his first tour. What kind of jobs would the promoter do? I did whatever needed to get done. So one day, you're delivering pizza to the band, and the next day, I'm... got a bag full of $15,000, and I'm walking through a parking lot looking over my shoulder, thinking everybody knows exactly what I'm doing. Well, you did what you had to do. Some things we don't talk about. My mom wanted to go see this tour. Now, you know, nobody wants to go to a concert with their mom. Especially when they're 19 years old. So, rebelliously, I... I wore a Kiss T-shirt. So, I don't know which one of us was more embarrassed, whether it was me or my mom. And we went to this concert. We're trying to get in, and the guy's giving us kind of a hard time and looking at our tickets and the thing, and we can't get in... And then, this guy comes walking up, and he doesn't have tickets, and he tries to get in. And the cop at the door is not letting him in, and not letting him in. And so, finally, like, a bunch of people come out, and they get Bob, and Bob turns around and he's like... And I'm just like this... And my mom's like, "Come on." And I don't wanna, "come on," but my mother pushes us through, and so we go in with Bob, and, um... Bob turned around and he saw my shirt, and he was like, "Do you like them?" And then I realized he wanted to talk about Kiss. I think I was trying to... to sound like I was... smart, and so I started saying, "Well, you know, I think that they paint their faces in this Kabuki style." And he said, "Oh, I bet Okuni never spit blood into the audience." And I was like, "Okuni?" And he's like, "Izumo no Okuni." Oh, and that's, you know, it's one of the guys who started, uh, Kabuki.

Most people'd kind of stay away from Scarlet, but, uh, not me. Her boyfriend at the time was the leader of Kiss. And she took me over to Queens to see them play. They were playing in a small club. They had face paint on, and I thought that was kind of interesting. I kind of filed that away somewhere. Clap your hands! ♪ I wanna rock and roll all night ♪ Yeah, I remember a lot of things. They... They said I had a wonderful time. I think I did. They said every time we used to do any interviews, all they wanted to know was, "Ronnie, we wanna hear about the orgies." I said, "Orgies?" I said, "God damn, we never had any orgies. That sounds nasty as hell." I said, "We might have had 14 or 15 people in love a time or two, but no orgies." Look who's here. Yo, man. Well, Ronnie Hawkins, now, he looked like a shitkicker, but he spoke with the wisdom of a sage. He was like a... a... gladiator or something... that wrestled and raced in, uh, in... in some nondescript Roman arena. Uh... you expected Ronnie to, uh, to wear a toga... instead of that ratty cowboy hat. - Remember Scarlet Rivera? - Oh, yeah. She fell in love with my rhythm man from my band, Scarlet did. Yeah, they put on some interesting shows there, up there in my room. I think I narrated a couple of 'em. I'm not sure. But, uh, yeah, she was something else... wore a sword. She had... She wore a sword everywhere she went, that girl, so I didn't... I was a little bit uneasy about trying to slip her out, 'cause, boy, if you didn't satisfy her, she's liable to stab you. She was unusual. I went to her room once, and there was a box of stuff. Like, chains and mirrors... candelabras and... She had swords. She had a snake. Just, uh... many things in... in a trunk. And, uh, that told me more about her than anything she had to say. She didn't say much. But she didn't have to. - What's that? - This? This is my friend. He keeps me company while I play. He's playing the dance beyond his limits. Something that most people would say is impossible. But artists like to challenge the impossible, I guess. That's why we wear the makeup we wear, I guess, too. It's a striking image you have onstage. Mr. Tambourine Man gives us the opportunity to be whoever we wish to be. This, uh, young, beautiful, young lady over here is Scarlet. She plays with us, too. I'd been at the high holy gypsy holiday at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, South of France. It happens to be on my birthday, so it was like going home. Manitas de Plata was there, and he played all night along the campfire. I mean, he was fantastic. And, uh, I stayed up till dawn just listening to him play. Some time after that, couldn't have been more than a week, that song came to me in a dream. ♪ Your breath is sweet ♪ ♪ Your eyes are like Two jewels in the sky ♪ ♪ Your back is straight Your hair is smooth ♪ ♪ On the pillow where you lie ♪ ♪ But I don't sense affection ♪ ♪ No gratitude or love ♪ ♪ Your loyalty is not to me ♪ ♪ But to the stars above ♪ ♪ One more cup of coffee for the road ♪ ♪ One more cup of coffee 'fore I go ♪ ♪ To the valley below ♪ ♪ Your daddy, he's an outlaw ♪ ♪ And a wanderer by trade ♪ ♪ He'll teach you how to pick and choose ♪ ♪ And how to throw the blade ♪ ♪ He oversees his kingdom ♪ ♪ So no stranger does intrude ♪ ♪ His voice, it trembles as he calls out ♪ ♪ For another plate of food ♪ ♪ One more cup of coffee for the road ♪ ♪ One more cup of coffee 'fore I go ♪ ♪ To the valley below ♪ ♪ Your sister sees the future ♪ ♪ Like your mama and yourself ♪ ♪ You've never learned to read or write ♪ ♪ There's no books upon your shelf ♪ ♪ And your pleasure knows no limits ♪ ♪ Your voice is like a meadowlark ♪ ♪ But your heart is like an ocean ♪ ♪ Mysterious and dark ♪ ♪ One more cup of coffee for the road ♪ ♪ One more cup of coffee 'fore I go ♪ ♪ To the valley below ♪ Are you used to going to rock shows? No, it's one of the very few I've seen. I finally realized, after last night, I've been missing an awful lot. I thought it was the most unusual occurrence. I never... I never noticed... as a... as a part of an audience, I never paid attention to a... to a response between an audience and people on the stage, performers onstage. That, to me, was like a show all by itself. It was like one battery charging another. And... you not only could feel the vibes, you could... you could almost see them. There was a... a love affair between the performers and the audience. Uh, I was thinking about the forces that draw people together. The magnetism that makes the unit that's now formed as Rolling Thunder. And, uh... to me, the future already exists. For some people, maybe for everyone. It's just a matter of tuning yourself to it. "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix..." Allen Ginsberg was a saintlike figure. It was like having a... kinda like a father figure. He was always very sober. No, Allen Ginsberg was anything but a father figure. He was definitely not a father figure. Allen Ginsberg, a guy I really... I really miss, of the ones that are gone. We became very friendly, I mean, you know, he... he... I wasn't a bad-looking, you know, little 19-year-old at the time, and he had a thing for straight, talented... um... teenage boys. So, that probably added to it, I suppose. One thing people don't know about Ginsberg is that he was an incredible dancer. Um... who... he would just do these steps that were so unusual and exciting. You know, and he'd always have a good dance partner, too. Uh, usually somebody from the tour, somebody we'd pick up along the way. Uh... He danced a lot, Ginsberg. "& shaman he swings a skinny leg to the sky & shaman he desires you be there watching shaman don't care about eating now he's got his paint on he's ready for jive & shaman's going to sway & gesture in space & shaman's shouting yeah for you & singing your sorrow shaman's not faithful except to you shaman does it for you you know all this shaman's got his eyes on the violin." There was this yearning, Allen's yearning, to either be Bob or... have Bob love him more. And I remember Bob saying, "Just go out and sing on the street corners." So Allen was essentially doing that. ♪ Ah... ♪ Seeing Ginsberg was like going to see the Oracle of Delphi. He didn't care about material wealth or political power. He was his own kind of king. But... he wanted to play music. He had already achieved what any national poet could hope to achieve. "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness." Very few poets have done that. Robert Frost, maybe. "Promises to keep, miles to go before I sleep." Whitman said, "I am large, I contain multitudes." We still remember those lines today. Today's poets don't reach into the public consciousness that way. So it was remarkable that Allen had actually broken through. Nowadays, lines that people remember are lines from songs, lyrics from songs... "Your cheatin' heart will make you weep." "Don't change your hair for me, not if you care for me." "I'm in the mood for love." "What a difference a day makes." "Ain't misbehavin'." Allen wanted his lines to be remembered like that, but he was a poet. He wasn't a songwriter. By 1970 through 1975, all of the, uh, heroes of song and poetry were out on their own, uh... in the solitude... doing their art. The people that were going to die or drink themselves to death, as many great artists did, or get strung out... uh, went down to... uh... She'ol, as Kerouac did, 105 miles from this ocean, buried in Lowell. But that's where I got all my poetry, out of Mexico City Blues. You ever read this? - Sure. - This book... - This is my favorite. - Yeah, I... I read this. Uh... My good friend Dave Whitaker gave me a copy of this book. - When? - Uh, in Minneapolis in 1959. Uh-huh. I remember when David gave me this book, it just blew a hole in my mind. Really? Yeah. "What's been buried in the grave? Dust. - Perfect..." - "Perfect dust." "Perfect dust in time." He wrote a lot about being dead. "Once I went to a movie At midnight, 1940, Mice and Men, the name of it. The Red Block Boxcars Rolling by Yessir life finally gets tired of living - On both occasions I had wild Face looking into lights Of streets where phantoms Hastened out of sight Into Memorial cello time." Oh, yeah. Here's one. "Dead and don't know it, Living and do. The living have a dead idea. A person is a living idea; after death, a dead idea. When rock becomes air..." "I will be there." - He's here. - Yeah, this is where he is. - Yeah. So rock has become air. - Yeah. - Let's sit down a minute, relax. - Well, this is... - Yes, it's not every day... - Kerouac, he honored life. I had to read everything again, that Kerouac wrote. Not that I did, but I thought about it differently. All of a sudden, On the Road, he was talking about the road of life. "Strange now to think of you, gone without corsets and eyes, while I walk on the sunny pavement of Greenwich Village, downtown Manhattan, clear winter noon, and I've been up all night talking, talking, reading the Kaddish aloud, listening to Ray Charles blues shout blind on the phonograph The rhythm, the rhythm and your memory in my head..." "like a poem in the dark... escaped back to Oblivion... No more to say, and nothing to weep for but the Beings in the Dream, trapped in its disappearance, sighing, screaming with it, buying and selling pieces of phantom, laughing and weeping over mahjong, worshipping each other, worshipping the God included in it all... longing or inevitability? while it lasts, a Vision...

About five in the afternoon, the day before the show, right? - Yeah. - You were there, you'd been there for a couple of days, you hit on me right away. You said you wanted this button, right? Thought I was Dylan or some shit like that. - Yeah, right. Mm-hmm. - Yeah. A lot of people think you are, Larry. Well, it's pretty obvious. Take your glasses off for a minute. - I'm not him. - Well, anyways... That little shit Ratso, he was the worst. He dressed like Dylan, he tried to talk like Dylan, always trying to ingratiate himself. He thought he was Hunter Thompson just because he was writing for Rolling Stone. He didn't want anyone else with vision around. Did he wind up causing problems for you? Please. Does the cockroach really cause problems for the house? No, it's just a nuisance. Van Dorp was an unusual guy. He's one of those kind of people who's trying to... just needs an enemy. And... uh, he was trying to make enemies where there weren't any, and, uh, he... he was... he was successful at that. He... He angered a lot... lots of people, especially in catering. He would eat two or three, uh, meals that really... really were for somebody else. So, he ate more than he was supposed to, and I think... and I think he... ...uh, I think he stuck his nose in places it might've should not have been. He was also a very paranoid person. Complained to people that his room was bugged. Uh, which, you know, McGuinn was on that tour, and McGuinn who at that point was into, uh, very sophisticated electronics. So I'm not saying it wasn't bugged but... but I'm not saying that it was bugged, because I don't know that for a fact. All tickets are $8.50 a ticket. What were the audiences like... that you played to? Well, they would all be... hysterically happy. So, I mean, you can't really judge much from saying, "What would the audiences be like?" They would all be people who would've slit each other's throats to get there. What a lovely couple! - Don't make myths.

You had no reservations about going on tour? Well... Sure. I mean... I think it probably sounded like... fun, but I also had experienced Dylan, and, you know, how much fun that can be on any tour or not. So, um... But I think, know... knowing that it was gonna be a lot of people, and I was gonna have my own family with me... It sounded exciting, you know. I had my own freedom... to sing and dance in a way that I didn't do on my own stage. Maybe there wasn't enough for her to do and she'd begin to go a little stir-crazy. Started doing, uh... boogaloo and hanging out with people maybe she shouldn't be hanging out with, and, um... Ugh. I don't know what happened. Boy, sitting right next to Bob Dylan, man. Whew. I got a light if you got a smoke. One time, I got all dressed up as Bob, which I would do periodically. I used to put these little beard markings all over and have a mustache on. And then I'd put his hat on and some whiteface. ♪ All the time you dress so fine ♪ ♪ Threw the bums a dime in your prime... ♪ I walked over with nobody really paying attention, and I'd be Bob. And there was this table of, like, food and catering and coffee, and Louie was there, and I said... "Handsome, give me some coffee." Instantly, people got me some coffee like that. "D'you want this? D'you want this? You want milk? Do you want sugar?" And I just had a cigarette in my hand, going like that, and they treated me the way they treat Bob. "D'you want this? D'you want that? What can we do?" It was amazing. It was amazing until finally I said something like, "Oh, for Christ sake, Louie." And then he realized. Oh, yeah, and I had a little wig on with my hair coming out underneath it. Terrible. It's like the court of Henry VIII or something, you know? Who's Anne Boleyn, you know? Which one is gonna get the ax, you know? You know what I mean? You know, there's that kind of dynamic. And people are maneuvering to get closer, and then there are the people who are using you to maneuver. David Mansfield wanted to sing a song with me, uh... Ugh. God. That, uh, a drummer did. I didn't see what the point of it all was. - What does makeup do for you? - I don't know. Just hides, you know, the ugliness a little bit. Everyone, of course, you know, wanted their shot, wanted their time in the sun. But we all know that, you know, you have to... give for the good of the show. And it was such an honor to be there, so that was no problem. Who were the people you were closest with on the tour? I know this sounds funny, but I felt close to Bob. I just always felt close to him from the moment I met him. Um, I'm sure many people that feel that way. Um... I know Mick Ronson told me, however, when I said, um... you know, "Don't you love Bob?" and he said, "I don't know. He's never spoken to me." Um, and then once we were in Massachusetts, and people were about to arrive. I don't know who they were, but not our little group. Bob and I were alone in the basement, and Bob said, "Ronee, help." And I said, "Help what?" And... And I felt so bad about that afterwards because I didn't mean to be... cruel or thoughtless to Bob, but I always thought, you know, I had to treat him just like a regular person if I were going to be friends with him. But later on, I understood a little more what he might be asking help for. What was he asking help for? I think the onslaught of strangers. Hello, take my picture, please! Hiya, man. I was in the park with another one of my modeling jobs. Of course, the whole park is full of everybody doing whatever they're doing, and suddenly I hear, "Hey, Kiss," and I'm just, of course, mortified. And then I realize... that it's him. So, of course, I'm even more mortified. I think I met her with her mother. She was a nice girl. Uh... She was so young, anyway, you know. But she seemed old for her age. Everybody wants to be a movie star... don't they? But, you know, when you live in the middle of nowhere, when you tell somebody you wanna be a movie star, they think you're... insane. She, uh, used to tell me, uh, someday she's going to be a famous actress. Uh, okay. A couple of days later he said, um... "You know, hey... how about if you just come on the road with us?" And I thought, "And do what?" "You know, you could help out with the costumes and help out backstage and stuff." - "Just Like a Woman." - What? - "Just Like a Woman"? - Yeah! - Do we know that song? - I don't know, we could fake it. It was one of the first shows. - I was backstage. - ...we'll try it. Joan Baez had asked me to iron her shirt. A second later I hear, "Hey... Sharon." And there was this, um, really decrepit old piano shoved off to the side, and Bob was kinda hunched over it. And he gives me that... that look.

That was his invention, you know, and all these people showed up. So, yeah. - What do you got, Larry? - The tour was very open-ended, so whatever city they went to, if there was a local friend and musician, there would be a slot for them to come up and play. For example, uh, in Connecticut, Joni Mitchell... came up, did a couple of songs, and loved it so much that she stayed on for the rest of the tour. She just became part of the... this experience. How did you two end up on the road? - I don't know... - I came through Allen. She came through Allen Ginsberg. Um... I had finished a project and... was, you know, in a kind of a postnatal state and wanted to come and see a concert, and, uh, got sucked into it. You know, just shelved everything that... Everything else seemed, uh, minorly important compared to this, like, as an experience, and an experiment in communal existence. You know? What do you think?

If you go up and spill poetry for any length of time, they're gonna be, you know, gone, you know? Make it two minutes, Allen. Two minutes is plenty, I'm telling you. - Okay. - What about more cuts? - Two minutes. - We're still cutting. The show was originally three hours. Ginsberg, who appeared in the show originally, there was not enough time for him to perform during the show, so his section was cut. He and Peter Orlovsky became the baggage handlers. We would put our bags outside the door, and he would take them every day. You're a fuckin' luggage handler? - God, yeah, and I give massages sometimes. - You're a poet!

Uh, tomorrow morning, we're gonna sit with Allen for one hour. - To do what? - After we wake up, sit and meditate. At a party at Gordon Lightfoot's house, Toronto, Canada. Joni Mitchell, she would go out and do her new songs. She wouldn't do any hits. And the audience reaction was a little sort of muted for these new songs, as it usually is when artists try to do new songs. And I remember, she came off and she said, "McGuinn, I don't know why I'm so scared out there. I just don't..." I said, "You're just doing new songs. You ought to do something that they recognize, and then they'll, you know, loosen up." She said, "No, no, I... I can't do that. I think that's a bad idea." I admired her for her courage to do the new stuff only. Joni wrote this song about this tour, and on this tour, and for this tour. Okay, D-minor now. Yeah, some dissonance. I had been loudly proclaiming that my three favorite male songwriters were Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, and Kinky Friedman. So, Jonistarted interrogating me backstage one day, saying, "What do you mean, male? Why do you make that distinction, male songwriters? I mean, what about my stuff? I mean, don't you characterize my stuff, like, you know, in the same league as Bob and Leonard Cohen?" And we got into this long discussion about, well, the male versus female perspective, and anima-animus, and, you know, male-female dynamic, and everything, you know. But it became this long, drawn-out confrontation, and we bonded on that. ♪ No regrets, Coyote ♪ ♪ We just come from such different sets Of circumstance ♪ ♪ I'm up all night in the studios ♪ ♪ And you're up early on your ranch ♪ ♪ Brushing out a broodmare's tail ♪ ♪ While the sun is ascending ♪ ♪ And I'll just be getting home With my reel-to-reel ♪ ♪ There's no comprehending ♪ ♪ Just how close To the bone and the skin ♪ ♪ And the eyes and the lips you can get ♪ ♪ And still feel so alone ♪ ♪ And still feel related ♪ ♪ Like stations in a relay ♪ ♪ You're not a hit-and-run driver No, no ♪ ♪ Racing away ♪ ♪ You just picked up a hitcher ♪ ♪ A prisoner of the white lines On the freeway ♪ ♪ We saw a farmhouse burning down ♪ ♪ In the middle of nowhere In the middle of the night ♪ ♪ And we rolled right past that tragedy ♪ ♪ Till we came to some roadside lights ♪ ♪ And a local band was playing ♪ ♪ Locals were mincin' And shakin' on the floor ♪ ♪ The next thing I know ♪ ♪ That Coyote's at my door ♪ ♪ And he pins me in a corner And he won't take no ♪ ♪ He drags me out on the dance floor ♪ ♪ And we're dancin' close and slow ♪ ♪ He's got a woman at home ♪ ♪ One for the night And now he wants one for the day ♪ ♪ Oh, why'd you have to get so drunk And lead me on that way? ♪ ♪ You just picked up a hitcher ♪ ♪ A prisoner of the white lines And the freeway ♪ Let's call Hopper, man.

We have an America that, in Bob Dylan's phrase, is busy being born, not busy dying. I was very enamored of Jimmy Carter. He... I thought he was a really soulful, interesting guy, and he liked me. So, you know, Imaintained a relationship with him for a long time. And he's the guy who got me into the Rolling Thunder concert that night. Jimmy Carter. Which is another story. I was... I was one of the youngest members of the Congress. And so I was, um... Yeah, I mean, I was torn between two generations there. I was being pulled in both... You know, you want to get anything done, you have to get along with people in the Congress. You know, you don't get anything done anymore because nobody wants to, but... in my day you, you know, you made an effort to get along with these guys. And most of them were considerably older than I was. And Dylan was considered the enemy, really, by a lot of these guys. I had grown up in this era where, you know, you wanted to be an adult, you wanted to drink a martini with your dad, you know. And now... you know, "Never trust anybody over 30." Right? And I'm caught in the middle of this, and I'm dealing in the Congress with all these old guys, and... You know, it's an interesting conundrum. My own interest in the criminal justice system is very heartfelt. One of the sources for my understanding about what's right and wrong in this society is from a personal, very close friend of mine a great poet named Bob Dylan. After listening to his records about "The Ballad of Hattie Carroll" and "Like a Rolling Stone," I've learned to appreciate the dynamism of change in a modern society. I grew up as a landowner's son, but I don't think I ever realized that the proper interrelationship between the landowner and those who worked on a farm until I heard Dylan's record, "I Ain't Gonna Work On Maggie's Farm No More." So I went to this meeting, I believe it was in Atlanta. Jimmy was there, and he and I spoke about a few things. And I can't remember exactly what was left unsaid, but I told him that I would call him back that night, and we were gonna finish this conversation. I had to get to the airport. So I get on the flight, I'm trying to get home. And I got caught in a storm, and we got diverted to Niagara Falls. And I get stashed in this cheesy little motel that the airline put us up in. I called Jimmy to say I hadn't reached home, but we could talk tomorrow, and he said, "Where are you?" And I said, "I'm in Niagara Falls." And he says, "Well, you just hit the jackpot because... because Bob Dylan's doing this Rolling Thunder concert there tonight, and you can go." He said, "I'll call him and I'll get you in." Dylan! Dylan, you're beautiful! Uncle Sam is going to sing one of his versions of "The Star-Spangled Banner." Ladies and gentlemen... I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical... This song about a human being who is also an Indian. - "Let America be America again." - And if you don't remember... "Let it be the dream it used to be." No, I'm sorry, you... you can't... - Excuse me. You can't shoot in here. - You need authorization. You cannot shoot in here, sir. - Why can't I shoot in here? - He's running the camera. What organization are you from? Do you know where you're going to? I don't know. You'll have to ask him. I'm sorry you had the hassle. Uh, we didn't know you were coming. Obviously. We just happened to be in the neighborhood. - I heard it was you. - I brought a friend if you don't mind. No, I don't mind, but I'm sorry you had any trouble downstairs. Uh, Irwin, this is Bob. - How are you? - Good. But if you're looking... to help the guy, in effect, you know, and your purpose is a social one rather than a record one, then I think it probably would make sense, you know, to comment, you know, early. You know what I'm saying? I don't know what your motivations are. You're kind of throwing it out and I haven't given a lot of thought. I think there's a Top 40 AM problem. Conversely, there may be a lot of black radio play, for example, in the east. - Or you make it AM play. - So WWRL would... It's a Bob Dylan statement, that it is unique. Whoever wants to play it can play it, but the idea is he wants it on the streets, so people can do with it what they want. But with those caveats, your motivation is to try to do what you can for the guy, then it probably makes sense to do it as quickly as possible. - That's the motivation. - Uh... ♪ Pistol shots ring out In a barroom night ♪ ♪ Enter Patty Valentine From the upper hall ♪ ♪ She sees the bartender In a pool of blood ♪ ♪ Cries out, "My God They killed them all"... ♪ If they can get it out on the street in a week that's, you know, that's good. That's what they were talking about. Rubin Carter was an amazing boxer, middleweight, who had been framed for a murder in New Jersey and was languishing now in Rahway State Prison. Bob wrote this incredible song, "Hurricane," and was very concerned about getting him out. I'd written songs about boxers before, so that was nothing new, but, uh... I hadn't really thought about, uh, Hurricane... because I didn't know about Hurricane. Uh... It... It never really crossed my path. I got the book. I read it. Um, I, you know, made a mental note that if I was coming east, or if I was east, I would, uh, visit him. We were there for, you know, most of the day, as far as I can remember. Uh, we got there in the morning and then left him when it was dark. I realized the man's philosophy and my philosophy were running on the same road. You know, and, uh, you don't meet too many people like that, you know, that you just know that kinda on the same path, mentally, you know. Yeah. Dylan was different than other people who came to see me. I mean, other people would ask the obvious questions. "Rubin, are you guilty?" You know, "Did you commit this crime?" "Did you do that?" You know. But Dylan wasn't asking that. Not at all. It seemed like he was searching for something else. It was as if he was saying, "Who are you, man?" You know, "Are you what I see?" I had a friend of mine send me his lyrics to his songs, and so I could read his lyrics, so I can get an... an idea of who I'm talkin' to here, you know. And... I found something that was, uh, very interesting.Very... That really connected us. Both of us were... were performers and crowd-pleasers. You know, me with the vicious left hook, you know, whose parents grew up in the Jim Crow South, and Dylan, uh, you know, with his... uh... the troubadour. So you got back, and you had the germ of an idea to do a song? - Yeah. - Why? I mean, you know, is this a return to protest... I mean... You know, is this, uh, "Hattie Carroll" revisited? Um, there's an injustice that has been done, you know. And the fact is that it can happen to anybody. - Mm-hmm. - You know? - And we have to be confronted with that. - So... So... This song is called "Hurricane."

Every time I see Bob now, and which we don't see each other frequently, but every time I see him, I ask Bob, "Have you found it yet, Bob?" And Bob says, "Yeah, I found it." But I know he hasn't, 'cause he keeps searching. He'd always say, "Hey, what are you searching for today?" I'd say, "What?" He'd say, "I know you're a searcher. What are you searching for?" I'd say, uh, "Well, Hurricane, I'm searching for the Holy Grail." And he'd say, "What?" I said, "I'm gonna search until I find it, like Sir Galahad." That's what I'm looking for. - Five minutes. Five minutes. - Do you think he's a genius? Is Bob Dylan a genius? I don't know. That's a strange word. Maybe. I think the most brilliant thing he did was putting a group of highly motivated and ambitious people on a train with no supervision, and then let them become the most extreme versions of themselves. Is that how you'd describe what happened? I know that's what happened to me. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. So, why did you come here to speak to me? Well, to try and, you know, stake my claim and say, "Here I am, this is me. I'm the one who made this. You're using it. This wouldn't exist without me. I'm the filmmaker here." December 4th, 1975, Montreal, Canada, last scheduled concert for the Rolling Thunder Revue. We phantoms are assembled at the end of the Rolling Thunder tour. Roger? Let's go. Luther? We started out trying to recover America. We discovered a certain amount of truth about ourselves. Old friends who thought their loves had been lost were able to get together and, uh, face each other eye to eye and sing over an electrical microphone to please the desires of myriad young yearners, who had been seeking some kind of union and community and saw therein an image of that community. Was the tour a success? The tour was a disaster, it was a catastrophe. - Why? - Well, I told 'em we should be playing to 20,000-seaters, but instead, you know, they wanted to play all these small joints. Now you've got 16 to 18 people onstage, and you got 15 people on the back line. Buses and hotel rooms and catering, and you're only playing to houses with 3,000 seats, so you're gonna hemorrhage money. We were in the red before we even got on the road. No, it wasn't a success. Not if you measure success in terms of profit. But it was a sense of adventure. So, in many ways, yes, it was very successful. Let's go. Time to go. - Come on. We're on. - Yeah, Rob, you look pretty.
