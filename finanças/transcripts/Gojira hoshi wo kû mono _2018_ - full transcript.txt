For many, many years, we have been observing you Earthlings. Far before Godzilla appeared, before the dawn of civilization, we continuously intervened in the lives of you Earthlings. You Earthlings have been so interesting to observe. As a result, we know more about you than you know about yourselves. In essence, humans are dependent on each other. And your ability to be self-determined, so-called freewill, is very limited. A god's words could never be accepted by you humans. Only the words of other humans are accepted by humans. It is for this reason that a human is required to reveal a god's will to other humans. In this case, you humans desire heroes. Not status, nor reasoning, but someone who embodies the spirit of your era through their beliefs and actions. Humans will admire that leader, search for truth in their words, and discover God in what they gaze at. Therefore, there is no need to persuade all humanity to enter heaven's gates. If just one person, a hero, shows the way, all of you will follow. I've searched and waited. A hero, shaped by human history, will eventually appear to lead the way. That's right. I've been waiting for you... Haruo. I can't detect its life signs. Is it dead? No. The electromagnetic pulses inside its body are still strong. They have slowed down, but the overall waveform is stable. It's only sleeping. Probably just saving power for its next awakening. What was the point of it, in the end? I mean, Godzilla's existence. Don't you remember? How was this monster born in the 20th century? Humanity's nuclear bomb experiments... Humanity's foolish actions created this monster. That's what we were taught. - But maybe it was the opposite. - The opposite? Let's think of the Earth as a massive ecosystem. Imagine if all the technologies that humans had created till now weren't really developed to serve our own ends, but to breathe life into that monster... That's another way to think about it. What if humans were merely the opening act to the creation of Godzilla, the ultimate life form? What? That's... Never say that in front of Captain Sakaki... As a human myself, I don't want to accept it either. All monsters, and Godzilla, are called monsters because they cannot be defeated by people. Defeating what has surpassed human intellect is no longer within the category of human achievement. From the moment you decided that you'll defeat Godzilla, you were aspiring to become something that is no longer human, Haruo! You're wrong! I... If you want to win, then steel your resolve! You'll surpass humanity and Godzilla, and become something greater! Haruo! There are no more transmissions from Mechagodzilla City after this one. Godzilla has once again entered a dormant state. That traitor... We were so close! Captain Sakaki should be sentenced to death! Thanks to that bastard's actions, we lost our one and only chance to defeat Godzilla! What would have happened after we defeated Godzilla? What on Earth would that city-scaled nanomachine have done to Earth's environment? A new era of prosperity lay in store for us, of course! A new future, in which all will be led by the Bilusaludo's ultimate wisdom! And for some mere personal belief, he... I could say the same about you! Becoming a monster fused with a machine? You call that prosperity? What is that if not your personal belief? What? Are you as delusional as Sakaki? Captain, Lieutenant Colonel Mulu-elu Galu-gu's actions were clearly rebellious. Captain Sakaki should be acknowledged for stopping him! Cut the crap, you Earthlings! Who on Earth do you think has helped you live this long? Just because you helped, does that mean you have the right to give us life or death? Even those who did not volunteer were forced to undergo the nanometal procedure, which is inexcusable! That was a necessary measure to defeat Godzilla! Can you not see the gravity of the situation? What I see is Mechagodzilla's true form! It is the Bilusaludo's weapon for the invasion of Earth! Aren't we fighting a common enemy? It's no good. There's nothing I can do. But... her heart is beating. She's alive, right? Thanks to the nanometal. What a frightening technology. The same metal that's eroding her body is acting like a life-support machine. She'll probably live on. But that's all. She'll never open her eyes again. We'll return to the Aratrum. They must have some more advanced treatments! Her brain has stopped functioning. Captain... She is already... So, this is where you were. What did the others say? They are arguing. Retreat is out of the question for now. What? Captain Sakaki, opinions are split regarding how you will be dealt with. Judging by Dolu-do, it seems like the Bilusaludo faction suggested to condemn your actions. Because we were only a step away from beating Godzilla? That's right. If you'd had cooperated with Galu-gu and the Bilusaludo, Godzilla might have been beaten. However, if you had done that, you would have had to desert Sergeant Tani, and you'd probably have had to become a monster yourself. Not in body, but in mind. Captain Sakaki has a strong sense of humanity. That's why we didn't beat Godzilla. Is that what you're trying to say? Galu-gu said that if we don't throw away our humanity, we'll never defeat Godzilla. In the end, we agreed with him in a paradoxical way... I disagree. Because Haruo chose not to throw away his humanity, the birth of the Bilusaludo's Godzilla has been hindered. Why was I the only one saved? Yuko... - That's... - It's a miracle! Captain, don't you think there's some deeper meanings there? What? The Bilusaludo were arrogant and turned their backs on God. Yuko, who was taken in by them, is also dead. She was punished for her sin! But you were protected by something and survived. And saved us all! This must be grace. A divine revelation that the choice you made was right! You guys... Everyone was enlightened by going through this trial. For our great god's intentions. Up until now, I'd never given it much thought. But now I have no doubts. Our god is protecting all of us, Captain. He hears our prayers of fighting Godzilla! Yuko... If you want to win, then steel your resolve! You'll surpass humanity and Godzilla and become something greater! I... I can't do it. This is the place of the God of the Houtua. You need permission to enter. Ah, is that so? I'm sorry. I think I'm lost. In the end, this Vulture was the only thing we recovered. But when the control unit was taken down, it received an emergency stop signal and the commands were locked. When we try to reboot it, it won't even connect with electricity. Are the functions of the nanometal itself frozen? I wonder how Belu-be managed to reboot it. They never shared that with us. Even if we tried to analyze it, Mechagodzilla City's remains have structurally broken down due to extreme heat. It's hopeless. Sokolov and I both touched the nanometal at the same time. He was engulfed by it in just a second. But I... Look, I got it on this part of my arm. But nothing happened. Sokolov was done for, but I was able to shake it off easily. It can't be explained. Right? - That's right. - It's a miracle. Exactly. It is an undeniable miracle. Both Captain Sakaki and I have been blessed. Captain Sakaki, do you have a minute? It seems like there were people who failed to escape and didn't suffer erosion from the nanometal. Really? They all have something in common. I'm amazed they're all calling this a miracle. Everyone in Mechagodzilla City complained about poor physical health and received a medical examination from me. So did you, Captain. So, the thing they have in common that you're talking about is...? Everyone got medical treatment in Houtua village. Perhaps Houtua's medical techniques include an anti-nanometal-erosion antibody of sorts. If that's the case, why aren't you telling everyone? Do you think I could do so in such a situation? No kidding! If they don't believe us, they'll probably hang us. Now most of the survivors are joining the Exif Cult. In a place like this, where we can't escape, I don't want to become the minority. Looking back now, our daily lives were full of miracles. - I couldn't see a thing. - Well, about medical supplies, I'd like to restrict their distribution. Is that all right, Captain Sakaki? - Realizing it is a miracle in itself. - Yes, that's fine. - I see. - I understand. Metphies, a moment please? Do you mind if we walk and talk? It's something personal. Please go ahead first. So, what's the matter? The thing that protected us from the nanometal... It wasn't a miracle. Houtua's medical treatment provided us a special antibody. Yeah, I guessed so. You knew it? How could you make fools of everyone like that? Maybe from your viewpoint I am being dishonest, but desperate times call for desperate measures. I have to do whatever it takes. Metphies... You... Let me tell you why. It is to fight Godzilla once again. To prepare for the next battle, we have to unite everyone's hearts. But... we can't... defeat Godzilla. Do you really believe that? Tell me the exact reason. Do you really have no means left to defeat Godzilla? Or have you just lost your will to fight Godzilla? If it's the former, you can take back what you've just said. I'll find a way. Will the god you worship beat Godzilla for us? Exactly. "Sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." One of Earth's scientists said that. How about you think of it like this: You talk about God in the same breath as the occult and superstition because your science is not sufficiently advanced to comprehend God. Wha...? To us, the existence of God is purely a mathematical conclusion. A technology you have yet to discover called the Gematron Calculation has allowed us to make contact with higher-dimensional beings. Are you serious? Yes. And just like humans rely on strategy and tactics, and like the Bilusaludo rely on engineering, we Exif rely on our god to defeat Godzilla. Don't talk nonsense! Why wait until now? If your great god is going to solve everything, what's the meaning of all those sacrifices we've made? Did everyone die for no reason? I've had no choice but to wait... for the time to be ripe. The anger that burns in your heart now, the hatred you have against Godzilla, will someday become prayers and reach the god. That's why I've been waiting... for the time when your hatred for Godzilla overcomes your doubt about God. If I join your religion, will I be able to defeat Godzilla? Don't mock me! Is that how you tricked Adam and the others? It can only be you, Haruo. If you welcome God to this world, you'd be the best one to stand at the altar. Why me? You are more noble and proud than anyone else, and you did not question how people ought to be. That's why you caught my eye. The one who truly hates Godzilla and the hero to stand in front of God. I told you that before, Haruo. Aratrum is maintaining a geosynchronous orbit. Due to the Bilusaludo engineers' boycott, the gravity-coil engine's efficiency was decreased. Right when we had to consider withdrawing from the Earthsphere again... Admiral, we are out of time. We must decide how to handle Captain Sakaki's case. - This is an emergency. - What's happened? - Captain Mori! - Dolu-do. Tell this to the members of the Central Committee! In response to your insulting attitude, we, the Bilusaludo, now exert the right to issue an objection by force! In repayment for our comrades who died in Mechagodzilla City, you must make Haruo Sakaki take ultimate responsibility. Until you agree to this demand, we will shut off the power of the Aratrum. Dolu-do, you would go this far? The Bilusaludo are a minority on the committee. Justifying the Mechagodzilla incident is a matter of life and death. - What is the status of the backup battery? - Operational. But the residential circulation system can't be maintained more than 48 hours. Call the security forces immediately! We need to devise a strategy to recapture the power station! Wait! Do you intend to exacerbate our problems further? This is a full-fledged revolt! This is no longer just an issue of Captain Sakaki alone. If we give in to such intimidation, we will be handing over all initiative to the Bilusaludo from now on! Ah, so there you are. Metphies lost his mind. It's as if my words can't reach him. Well, as a man of religion, I guess you could say that he's back on his right path. For any missionary, this is a great opportunity. People are desperate after seeing that even Mechagodzilla is powerless. They can only escape despair by clinging to God. But is it right for us to just let them be? Regardless of whether it's right or wrong, we don't have the right to tell them what they can and can't do. What do you mean? It's a tricky situation. Metphies has switched the incident at Mechagodzilla City from your liability issue to a religious miracle. And so, Captain Sakaki has gone from being a trustworthy leader to some sort of altar decoration. People here are thankful for what you've done. But they don't want to hear your opinion on anything. They'll only listen to what comes out of Metphies' mouth. The whole thing is entirely on him. Even if that's true, what do they want with me? Oh, yes, I forgot. Come with me. As of this moment, a brand-new prayer altar has been established. Now, let us honor our god! Let us pray and believe that a miracle will befall us! Through our devotion to our god, our god will grant us salvation and blessings. Let us hope that Garbetrium's guidance will help us through our struggles. The thing is, I've just received contacts from the mother ship. The Bilusaludos seem to have taken over Aratrum's power station. What? They're shutting off Aratrum's power until you are sentenced. And, well... We think the best way to solve this... is to have you vanish for a while. It will appear as if you've escaped. - Wha...? - I hate to do this, but it's the only way to protect you and calm things down. If you deviate from regulations so much that even Mori can't defend you, we might be able to reach a compromise in negotiation with Dolo-du. But if that's the case... I know. It doesn't solve any foundational problems, but it's enough to buy us some time until everyone cools down. Miana... Why... This girl is going to help you out. I'm not sure to what extent she understands my instructions, but... Haruo. Hide. Safe. Uh... Yes... I guess that'll do. Captain, if you stay here, you will be used for Metphies's own ends. There are times when doing nothing is the best course of action. You must be patient for now. I understand. Haruo? Painful... Sadness... Why? I... wanted to defeat Godzilla. My chance was right there in front of me. But somehow... I couldn't bring myself to do it. In the past, humans lost to Godzilla. You survived, but lost your civilizations. And for us who escaped, we lost something even greater. If I have the courage to stand up against Godzilla again, I thought I would be able to take something back. But in the end, humans continue to fight amongst each other. They turn a blind eye towards reality. And now I don't even have a place to be. For what reason did I go this far? You, me, not lose. We won, so we are here. Are you trying to cheer me up? You wanted to lose for a long time. So, what do you consider a win or a loss? Win is survive. Live on. Connect life. Loss is die, disappear. To challenge Godzilla. Haruo must win. From now on, with us, together. What? I can connect life. Why would you do that? Accept visitors. Learn them. Our role. It's all right. You don't have to go that far. Can you let me rest? Here, I can sleep without any worries. Current standby power is at 43%. Due to the malfunction of some onboard circulation systems, we have consumed more energy than expected. - Agitation is spreading within the ship. - What should we do? Damn the Bilusaludo... What the hell are the higher-ups doing? We should not fear the darkness. We must utilize the light of the human spirit and shine it forth. If we have faith, we can step forward even with our eyes firmly shut. Without hesitation or fear, we must pray. Peace lies therein. Everything is ready. Our sons. Good. I only need to add the finishing touches to this ritual. The alliance of the stars is as revealed. However, there were many unexpected plans. Excuse me, but I must say that I feel preparations could have gone smoother. No, in order to ensure the offering is perfect, there is more preparation yet to be done. We are only after a single Earthling. Are all these preparations really necessary? He is that valuable for us. For he is qualified to lead us towards true glory. Is that why you told the sacred name to an alien who is not even Exif? When the time comes, he will offer his soul to God and praise his name. Proceed as you wish. May the guidance of Garbetrium be with you. Praise the god. All will continue down the path to devotion. Do not hide in such a place. Why don't you show yourself? That time... I was undressed because I was being treated. Miana must have already... found the switch to unlock the suit. You are... Maina? I see... So, it was you... But... why? Because scared. You look like lose. You look like disappear. I'm scared. So I'll make you win. Connect life. I see. I'm scared too. Now, show yourself. From the start, you have been listening to our conversations. You've heard everything, right? The words that cannot be heard. Conversations through telepathy. When did you find that out? When I noticed you were the only one who always remained silent. Whenever you were with us, you wouldn't even utter a word. That's not an easy thing to do if you're not used to communicating through your mind. It seems I've overly made light of you as a regressed race. Your minds are more precise than I thought. Why did you keep your abilities a secret? To maintain trust, of course. For other races, telepathy is considered a threat. I didn't want them to beware of me. So you just made them underestimate you while you secretly read their thoughts? I don't need to go out of my way to read the minds of humans or Bilusaludo. Those tribes who do not know telepathy are ignorant of people's inner thoughts. Through their speech and expressions, they express how they feel openly anyway. They reveal everything about themselves. You just need to observe them. What is it that you desire? To offer guidance, salvation, and blessing to those who are lost. What are you blessing them with? What will you use to save them? Where are you guiding these people to... with all this secrecy? If I were to tell you that, I'd have to offer you up as sacrifice too. Now, get on your knees and pray... ...for the Golden Death. What are you doing? I was preparing to entertain you. The banquet will start soon. Banquet? Yes. I'll be inviting every soul on this planet to celebrate our blessings. You are one of our most important guests. Me? Now, drink this. Okay. Let's say every human in this world were to disappear completely. I wonder if Godzilla would be able to remain the way it is? What is this? No, it would only be a giant creature, but nothing more. Its power is feared. Its existence is hated. He is a monster, because he is cursed. That's why your existence is so essential. Godzilla is only Godzilla... because your hatred is towards it. Miana... Maina? Now... I heard my sister... She said, "Ghidorah." Metphies. As you can see, the pot is now empty. However, the soup that was inside hasn't just vanished. It has become a part of you. Part of your flesh and blood. It has neither deteriorated nor died. It simply ceased to be soup in a pot. Combining with something greater, it is reborn as something completely new. That is what I mean by devotion. But we are not soup. We can choose who we devote ourselves to. We just need to think clearly about it. What is a more desirable devotion? For example, Colonel Leland and Captain Sakaki have devoted themselves to the goal of humanity's victory. And although you could consider this a noble endeavor, their outcomes failed to meet up. For it was impossible to defeat Godzilla with humanity's justice alone. Then what is the right path to victory? It's the god! Only God can defeat Godzilla! Precisely. The one whose supreme power surpasses even that of Godzilla. Our great god. There is no path to victory... unless we devote ourselves, and become one with God. To be one with our god is to leave behind any notion that you are an individual. With this in mind, do you accept our god as your savior? Are you willing to sacrifice yourselves to him? Let us pray! Let us call on the name of God! Bring death to Godzilla! And victory to us! - Agreed! - Agreed! Very well... then now, let us reveal the secret name. Come forth, the Golden King, whose name is Ghidorah! The Wings of Death! Come forth Ghidorah! The Wings of Death! The almighty Ghidorah! Come forth! The Wings of Death! Come forth Ghidorah! Bring us a glorious end! Help us achieve ultimate victory with our flesh and blood! Oh, great Ghidorah! Bring us victory! Come forth, Ghidorah! Help us achieve ultimate victory with our flesh and blood! Come forth, Ghidorah! Bring us to a glorious end! Come forth Ghidorah! The Wings of Death! The almighty Ghidorah! Come forth! The Wings of Death! Ghidorah! Bring us victory! A distorted gravity wave has been detected close to the ship! What? Is it something other than Godzilla? Space-time is breaking down! This is... a singularity! It... It can't be! A naturally occurring singularity? That's impossible! There's no change on the monitor. The external monitor signals have been on loop from 120 seconds ago! This... This is unexplainable! Everything was normal until just now! The interior main frame's Gematronic calculation circuits are sending out codes I've never seen before! I can't control it! Is someone trying to hack us? Come forth, Ghidorah! Bring us to a glorious end! The time has come... The singularity's gravitational field is expanding, no... It's moving... No... What the hell is this? The border of the gravitational field is changing. You fool! Give me precise reports! But I don't know what is going on! Anyway... An object more massive than the singularity is... is approaching us! Can't you provide me with a proper analysis? All outboard sensors, thermal response, radio waves, radiation... the time stamps of the data are all over the place! An analysis program has 80% of all systems spewing run-time errors! What have you done? Dolu-do, are you responsible for this? No! What is happening? What is it? Is the cause of the abnormality internal or external? It can't be... Space-time itself is distorting! Steering systems, navigation systems... Our systems are being overwritten by a non-authenticated command. What is the source of the input signal? The Gematron calculation crystal inside the main frame! This... This is not someone hacking us! Target coordinate... What is this, an imaginary number? Where is this ship being taken? There is a gravitational field around the Aratrum! This is impossible! Ergo region expansion! We're being dragged to the static limit! Quickly turn back! Thrusters to full power! I'm trying to, but the steering command won't work! An anomalous gravitational field has hit the ship! External pressure has exceeded 270% of the hull's durability limit. Cracks in residential blocks two and three! They're decompressing! Where is the plasma propeller? Why won't it ignite? There is not enough power! Dolu-do! Restore the power! Hurry! I'm trying to, but I can't! What do you mean? Stop kidding me! Rotational deviation increasing! The electromagnetic shell will collapse! Attention, Power Room! Dolu-do, respond! The power room was already destroyed 40 seconds ago! Then what was that transmission just now? I... I don't know! All data transmissions are losing temporal integrity! No way... We've lost signs of life on the bridge. So we're... We're dead? Why? Why is this...? Aratrum! Aratrum, please respond! What exactly happened? Professor! We can no longer detect signals from the Aratrum. And this gravitational field disturbance... Could it have been attacked by Godzilla? No. I can't detect any attacks from the ground. What...? What on Earth is going on? Everybody... go... there... The lookout tower? Let's go! Let me through! Let me through! Excuse me. This... This is... What is about to happen? It's a powerful gravitational field. So this is where you were, Dr. Martin. Captain Sakaki! What's going on? - Haruo! - What? I can hear it from there. "Ghidorah"... What's going on over there? There are faint life signs near that hill. I'll go there. You stay put. But...! What are you on about? Explain yourself! Metphies is planning something. Planning? What could he possibly be planning in this situation...? You mean he planned all this? That's what I need to find out. - Doctor! - What? I've detected Godzilla's vibrations! What did you say? It's leaving the base of Mt. Fuji and appears to be headed in our direction! Godzilla, too, at a time like this? Updrafts created by this field have created cumulonimbus clouds. I can't believe we're seeing this on planet Earth... What is causing all of this? Does it have something to do with the loss of communication with the Aratrum? A strong downburst is expected. Isn't it dangerous to be here? But Godzilla is approaching the area. We can't let it roam free! Look! Something is coming out of the clouds. A gas front? No, it's something else... There's another one! Over there, too! - Those rifts... - What the hell are they? What is it? Is that... a monster as well? That's impossible! Why has the sensor not detected a thing that size? Infrared, radio, magnetic waves... they're all unresponsive! The only data I've been able to receive is the increasing gravitational waves! Godzilla is the only thing there! Impossible... We can see it, can't we? What? A malfunction? - It isn't working here, either! - What? No matter how many times I try it, it's not working! Even if I enlarge the search area, there's no response! What's going on? What... is that...? Even Godzilla... What are you planning, Metphies? I'm seeing a sudden spike in Godzilla's electromagnetic waves! What? Don't tell me it's going to fight that thing? The beam curved? Godzilla's electromagnetic waves are spiking again. Did it use gravity waves to bend the heat ray? No, it can't be. Space itself is distorting? According to the data, the beam continued in a straight line! There is no indication of the beam ever curving. That monster cannot be seen on this machine. It can only be detected with our eyes and ears. Are you saying it's a hallucination? It's passing through it! Could it be that it has no physical form? But it bites Godzilla! It makes no sense! It can touch, but not be touched? It's a contradiction! What happened to the asymmetric shield? Even nuclear warheads were ineffective against Godzilla. Godzilla's internal electromagnetic waves have dropped dramatically! But it was only bitten... There can be no doubt that there's a shield surrounding Godzilla! But its waveform hasn't changed at all. There isn't any indication of it being damaged! Then what's happening? Are we just having some horrible dream? The gravitational disturbance is expanding! Huh? There are three of them now! What is going on? Still nothing is showing on the sensor? It still shows nothing. All we can see is the abnormal gravitational field is expanding. Apart from that, there is no response at all! Then... what is that thing? Ghidorah. Ghidorah? Yes. The one that shall devour all. The King of the Void. Metphies? What are you doing here? Miana! She's alive. What is going on? Did you do all of this? My mission, handed down across eternal time, is about to be fulfilled. Your mission? I've been waiting for this moment. Our chance meeting with you, the long journey through the void. Everything was for this day of harvest. Life sprouts from seeds known as planets. The flower called people blooms into civilization. The final fruit of that flower is Godzilla. We Exif have seen this cycle occur on many planets. And our god is the one who picks that fruit and eats it. King Ghidorah. The Golden Death. This universe only exists and has value as a tribute and a sacrifice to Him. Ghidorah... Isn't that the monster who destroyed your planet? We Exif once strove to find the ultimate truth. It lead us to make ourselves offerings and become one with our god. Offerings? We handful of priests were left behind to spread this blessing across the universe. You call destruction a blessing? Yes. Not only Godzilla, but also us and this planet... are you trying to destroy it all with Ghidorah? Embrace this demise. There is no greater blessing. Don't mess around! Do not refuse it. Do not lose your way. Hand yourself over to fate. Haruo. Deep down, you too... must have wished for it. Cut... the... crap...! The electromagnetic waves are decreasing. Godzilla is definitely taking damage! Godzilla's force field is definitely activated. But it's not deflecting the damage! Even though he's just being bitten? Those defenses that caused us so much trouble... Why... is destruction a blessing? Our ancestors obtained science to grant prosperity and even see into the future. With it, they sought across time for the truth of immortality. It was the proudest age in Exif's history. They predicted the end of time and reached a conclusion: "eternity does not exist." The universe is finite and will one day be deceased. Then we must seek for rest and glory beyond that final destruction. I will never accept... such nonsense... That is all deception, Haruo. Life is a series of fears. Release from them and eternal peace are the longstanding desires of every being. You're wrong! Listen to your heart. Face it. Face your own true wishes. Godzilla's body temperature is rising rapidly! Is it going to do the same thing that destroyed Mechagodzilla City? Godzilla's body temperature is still rising! With that much heat, he could really do some damage without even making a direct hit. Since your earliest memories, you have always been a prisoner of fear and despair. At that time, you must have prayed. "I hate this. I hope all this would end." I... But... The things that have shaped your life... are anger and humiliation, and an inescapable feeling of entrapment. That's why you have been waiting so long. Waiting for one day to be freed from it all. This can't be! Godzilla's temperature is now decreasing! The heat is being absorbed, even if the molecules are still vibrating. No, it's not only that. It is producing intense heat, but there's no steam at all. If Godzilla is cooling down, why can't we see any water vapor? But Godzilla is continuing to generate heat! Then the heat is just... disappearing? Where has it all gone? The molecules have been vibrating quickly! But the area surrounding Godzilla is cooling down rapidly. Its body temperature is also dropping. Part of Godzilla's body had already dropped below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. And it's still dropping! Perhaps this monster is from a different universe? The laws of our world don't apply to it. Its physical attacks are from another dimension? In that case... could it defeat Godzilla? This is no joke! That monster's powers wouldn't just destroy Godzilla. It would destroy this planet! Haruo. You should've remembered... those who bravely fulfilled their missions. Leland. I fought even though I had to throw away my life. Why didn't you avenge me? Why didn't you offer your life too? - Stop... - Ghidorah can defeat him. Yuko... Do you want to live on that badly? So you can live with those girls? Even though you've turned me into this...? Please... Just stop... Many people sacrificed their lives in the battle against Godzilla. Yet the only one left standing is you, Haruo. It's time for you to listen to them and settle this once and for all. Everyone who fought Godzilla before did so for the sake of mankind! They didn't want to destroy this planet along with Godzilla. Godzilla is floating? How can something so heavy float like that? This monster is from another dimension. Godzilla is totally powerless! Then how is this monster able to interfere with our dimension? What are the conditions? There isn't any way of proving their existence. That would explain a lot if it were just an illusion. Yet, Ghidorah's fang has made contact with Godzilla. From Ghidorah's perspective, Godzilla is not an illusion. The monster is determining Godzilla's existence... Our enemy is not Ghidorah! Someone in our universe is guiding it! I see... It must be Metphies. I have to tell Captain Sakaki. We need to go together to save Haruo. He is fighting with Ghidorah too! On many planets, civilizations at the peak of prosperity will eventually enter a forbidden zone. When the door is opened, a monster lets out its birth cry. Once a civilization gives birth to Godzilla, it is doomed to destruction. The question is, how should it accept that destruction? Don't you think it should stand resolutely proud to the very end? Are you saying we created a civilization... just to destroy it? But that's not something you should dwell on with sadness. Our universe is finite. This is a natural conclusion. That is why us primates must explore what lies beyond death and destruction. It can't be... It's not just Ghidorah. Even Godzilla's measurements are becoming ambiguous. Is reality being eroded? Is this the God of the Houtua? Your people's long journey was a pilgrimage to face your own destruction. Godzilla is a punishment for endlessly seeking prosperity. In order to overcome this ordeal, you must purify the souls of mankind through devotion to something greater. O'Egg. A guide to salvation from abominable dream. Deliver this song to the Passing Crows! Damn the blasphemous... That's a... moth? Haruo! Haruo! Do not fear. Listen carefully. What...? Haruo, is that you? I am calling you now with Maina's help. Ghidorah can only enter this world because there is a means of observation! Someone is acting as Ghidorah's eyes and watching Godzilla! It's probably... Why are you showing me all this? What do you want me to do? Fear makes a monster a monster. Hate makes a person a hero. And it is a hero's prayer that makes a god. It is you who did not become a new Godzilla, but continued to fight and curse Godzilla as a human who should give praise to our god. I want you to use your voice to call on our god. A hero like you offering his soul as a sacrifice will allow Ghidorah's divinity at last to firmly take root in this world. So, it was you... We do not accept life that lives for pain. The path to ruin should be peaceful. Grandpa. We were all saved thanks to this. Everybody has fought for too long. If we're only living to receive punishment, then ending it all is the only salvation for us. Don't you think so too, Haruo? But... But I... Haruo! Hurry! Give praise to the Wings of Destruction. Recite the golden name of our god, and seek victory and blessings. Is this a flower? That's right. A flower of spring I made to protect this precious child. One day, even in these times, spring will come after winter. A season of lives reviving. That's right. That's what we have prayed for when we named our child. That's right. Haruo. You are Haruo, my sweet child. That's it. That's it. There's no comfort for our mistakes. Those are only excuses. If I give up, it will all be a lie. I don't need salvation. Haruo... You... No matter how small and miserable my life may be, if I were to betray the faith of everyone who died before me, I... What? What's going on? Heat source, electromagnetic... all our sensors detect Ghidorah! The gravitational field is decaying... Amazing... The irregularity of the phenomenon has decreased so much we can get data now! Haruo... did you do it? The ergosphere region is closing rapidly! Ghidorah has finally been captured by the laws of our universe. You can defeat it now, Godzilla! Ah, Haruo... All that anger and hatred are burning bright. It's blinding. You are... Sadness and pain... are curses inflicted on all living things. Therefore... Haruo... as long as you can hold on to that life... Ghidorah will... be watching you... Metphies... This is... The season before the rains, the season of flowers. I wanted to show you, Haruo. I see... This is spring. It's the first time I've seen it, even though I bear its name. I've been waiting for you, Haruo. What did you mean when you said you needed me urgently? I want you to be the first one to see it. What are you doing? This won't move anymore, right? Well, take a look at this. I've successfully restarted the power reactor. Now the self-healing system will also recover. I think it will be able to move by itself come tomorrow morning. How? I was able to recover samples of nanometal that are still active from Yuko's body. There's not much equipment left, so I'm not sure if they can be analyzed, but this morning we finally succeeded in getting the control system to work. Do you not get it? It's a nanomachine that can self-replicate and make unlimited copies of technologies that it memorized! If we can control this in the same way as the Bilusaludo, we can revive past civilizations! We'll be saying farewell to today's primitive lives! What's wrong with you, Haruo? Exactly. The insatiable desire for prosperity is human nature. And yet again, the harvest season will come. Time is on our side. We only have to wait patiently. What's wrong? Haruo? Dr. Martin really is a genius! Soon, we'll say farewell to our primitive lifestyle. It's surprisingly nice once you get used to it, though. Well, this lifestyle suits you very well. Haruo, are you all right? I'm fine. Well, shall we get going? What do you plan on doing? Miana, do you find Godzilla scary? Yeah... Scary... So, I guess you hate it? Hate Godzilla? Hate? Godzilla is scary. Tornadoes and lightning are scary too. But... hate? I don't know. There is no such word in Houtua. Haruo, you can't go! That's losing! I know. A life without losing is no different from a beast. But when the time comes, we can also choose a losing battle. I don't understand. It's okay if you never understand. Perhaps if I was here you'd understand one day. That's why I've got to go. Do you understand, Godzilla? From all of those who hated you and challenged you, I am the last one remaining. I'm the one carrying all the lives you took and all the dreams you stole. I am right here! If you really are the incarnation of destruction... then this time, make sure you burn down everything without any traces! Along with all the curses from the past! I wish to not get sick. I wish to not have bad dreams. I wish to not get stung by bugs. I wish to not get hurt from climbing trees. Well, everyone, did you seal all the scary things into it? Yes! Our Wrathful Lord. Our Wrathful Lord. Please purify us again this year. Please forget the curses with this flame.
