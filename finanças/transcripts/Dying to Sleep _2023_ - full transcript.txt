How long has it been? - I don't know. - Really, since the four of us h in the same room together. And I know we said we want it to be just us tonight, but that doesn't mean I wanna keep you from your friends. - Yeah, friends are important, but it's nice to just, uh, sometimes spend time alone with - Yeah. Have you met any new friends lately, Mary? Or any special girls that are more than friends? - No. - Well, that's all right. Princess Charming will come along when she's ready. - So anyway, uh, how's work been going, birthday girl? - Oh, great. - I saw something exciting today - Oh. - I saw an ad at Safeway for a used Subaru. I thought it would be a fun birthday adventure. You know, to go looking at a car You think it's time for a car again, sweetheart? - Mom. - Helen, you know, if she doesn't want a car right now, she doesn't have to have a car. - I wasn't saying she has to get I was asking if she wants to go look at one. - I got it, but you're making her feel very uncomfortable. - Martin, I say- - Hey. - Oh, come on. How? - Hey, hey, stop. - Well, if your father wouldn't attack her about her work, she wouldn't be so on edge. - Oh for Christ sake, Helen, that is really rich. It's always me. I always do some - That's funny, because usually you do nothing ever about anything. Oh, did you hear about that farmer who died over there on his land on Glen O His wife couldn't find him for d and then a passerby sees something red in his field. What are the chances of that that's just sticking up out of the shrubs? I think that he- - Mom, mom. You gotta stop talking about that kind of stuff. - Wait, I had a dream last night Did the report say- - Helen, did you ever notice that you care more about other people's lives than you care about your own? I mean, if you spent more time worrying about your own life than other people's, I think you'd be a little happie I really do. - Martin, that's it. Not tonight. - What? What? Christ's sake. You know what, Helen? Everything is hell here. This is Below me, that's hell. And above me, is that heaven? No. It's hell. Everything's hell. Kids, your father and I have something to tell you - What? No, go ahead. - It wasn't really that surprisi Yeah. I didn't think it was actually gonna happen either. - On my birthday. Really? My God, my life has completely fallen apart. - Don't be so dramatic. 50% of families get divorced, yo - You saying you don't care? - I didn't say that. - Why is life so... I thought there was more to it t - I don't know. Ask Socrates, or whatever his name is. - Okay, dick head. I'm on new meds, my sleep schedule is all messed up, and my parents just told me that they're getting a divorce. Jerk. - Sorry. - It's like this is it? This is all there is to life? If hell is beneath us and heaven is above us, then we're just stuck in the mid I don't- - Oh, uh, sorry to interrupt, ki Uh, yeah. I'm just gonna head ou Your mom, she's just not my biggest fan right now. - You can crash at my spot if yo - Oh, uh, no. I got a place I can stay tonight.

Um, you know, despite what I was saying inside, I just want you to know, I, I've really felt a lot happier l You know, and, and don't listen to your mom, because I have been totally open about everything from the get, you know. - So you're like dating someone and mom is... Does she... - Oh, your mother, um, well she hasn't felt that wa about me in um, well, quite a wh It's been kind of a while and, u you know what? This is an easy target for drama So unfortunately, I- - What was that? Speak up. - Jesus. You know, there's my cue I'm, I'm really, I love you, pum but happy birthday. - Can we get the hell out of her - I guess it's the best worst outcome, you know. It's gotta be tough for mom. - Like she's some saint. - Really? - Mom's a fake who tells you how she really feels and then tries to cover it up like nothing happened. - How long are you gonna keep this up with her? I mean the past is in the- - Stop! - And you were... Stop? What do you mean? What's- - Stop your truck. - Where are you going? The hell are you doing? - You didn't see him? - See who? - That boy. - A boy? What are you talking ab - Like a teenage boy. - No, come on. - Wait. This is the place. - What place? - Right here. On the night of my birthday. Rem - Oh, yeah. I guess this is where we pulled over. Oh, it's been a year already? Crazy. Okay, let's go. - I saw something that night. - I know. That's why you swerved - I hit something. - Mary, we've already been over It, it was the fog against the h or a small tree branch that fell or it was a flying squirrel, or you hit a raccoon and it shot off into the dark. Now can we please just get back in the truck? It's cold. Hey, dude. (gentle dramatic music continues Mary, let's go. - So it was that England's greatest queen began her reign at the same time that Britain's greatest novelist began his career. - I'm seeing a boy. Mary, you're screaming! You're screaming. Wake up. Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It was just a nightmare. It was a nightmare. - I'm scared. - Of what? - I'm scared to go to sleep. - I had no idea it was this bad. What the hell is that doctor giv God. We're gonna see this idiot tomor - No, no, it's okay. - No, it's not. I'm gonna ask him what the fuck - I told you, he has me on a medication plan. I, I, I can't just go in. He's really expensive. - We're gonna see him tomorrow. Do you have work? - Uh, no. - Good. I'll take you up after I - You look like shit, man. - I didn't sleep. - Oh, fun birthday party? - Not really. I was up all night with Mary. - Oh, can't catch a break, huh? - You should've seen the way she was looking after this nightmare she had, ma - Did she tell you what it was o - Just like super weird stuff. Like people coming back to life and attacking her and- - Like zombies? - No, more like ghosts. - You know, this town is haunted as fuck. You know that. Well, you know, if, uh, Dr. Palmer's meds aren't cutting it, I was watching this new documentary yesterday on, like, new philosophies of alternative medicine. - Yeah. You sound like a cult le - I'm serious, man. I mean, people were getting healed from like acupuncture and, what was it? Reiki healing and hypnotherapy. - Hypnotherapy? - You remember my, my cousin Elliot, right? - Mm-hmm. - Smoked cigs 30 years straight. He went to go see a hypnotist, has not smoked a day after since I'm serious, man. You, uh, need some help taking care of Dr. Palmer? You know. - Nah. This chump's easy. - That chump was easy. I could tell by the way he was s - You are one hell of a golf shark. You know I was at the bell- - Dr. Palmer. - Hey, excuse me- I'm on the pho - Uh, last week. - Well, we can wait. It's about Mary. - Oh, my. - Oh, Brant. I'll have to call you back. - Yeah, call me later. - How can I help you? - Just a quick question. What the fuck kind of prescriptions do you have her on - Joe. - First of all, language, pal. Uh, here we go. Yeah. Okay. Currently, Prozac, Adderall, Ativan, and Ambien. - Okay and does it say anywhere in there that side effects may include getting attacked by dead people in your sleep? Because that's what's happening Do you even know that? - Neurological trauma is known to manifest itself in several ways. Now some we can explain and some Now, do you wanna hear more about it specifically or do you wanna stand there and act like some wanna be tough I suggest you have a seat. Now, Mary's got a hyperactive brain, and her issues started around the time of her new job. Family stress, this stuff can cause serious reactions, which can lead to night terrors. - Yeah. I got the why. I need the how to fix this. - Well, I'm doing the how. And she stays on track with the prescriptions I prescribed, we should see improvement. I mean, we can try upping her dosage again. - And turn her into a drug addict zombie like the ones in her horrible nightmares. Are you even listening? - What about something holistic? Like, like a doctor at a holisti - Yeah, like hypnotherapy. - Hypnotherapy, sure. Sometimes that can help. But if ancient rituals and holistic thinking were a hundred percent, we'd still be using leeches for women's periods. - Let me ask you something. - I'm listening. - Do you actually know anything? Do those degrees on the wall mean anything? Because are you listening to you All I'm hearing is maybe this, m and I came here to get a straight fucking answer. - That's enough. We're done here - So what do you want to do? Wanna look into a therapist or like a hospital in the city? - Yeah, and who's gonna pay for - I can pick up some extra shifts at the mill. - No, don't worry about it. I'll figure something out. - We will figure something. - I will figure something out. - Whoa. What are you talking abo - Because now I have to work eve now that you scared Dr. Palmer o Hope he'll still see me. Oh, come on. Don't be like that. - Thanks for the ride. - Wow. Hold on. What? Hey, Jen. - Hey. How are you? - Just have fun tonight, I guess - Wouldn't do anything you would - Mary, will you just live a little or something? - Okay, Joe, I'll make sure of i - Okay. Be safe. - Okay. - So do you wanna go to Shammy's next or Golden Grass? - Uh, I guess Shammy's. - Yay. I was gonna say the same - Yay. - Okay, will you stop moping? - Sorry. Sorry. I'm, I'm having - Oh, you're having fun. - I promise. - By the way, I forgot to tell y - Yeah. - Look at me. Oh, there's something in your teeth. Let's see. Is that a smile I see? - Shut, shut up. - Oh my gosh. I just want you to know you're not alone. You know that, right? You have so many people here for you. - I have you. - Yeah, of course you have me, but you also have Dr. Palmer, your parents, Joe. - Uh, not really. - Why? What happened? - Um, well, Dr. Palmer put me on these new prescriptions and I'm not really working, and I don't wanna stress my pare any more than they already are. And Joe thinks that he's helping but he's just making everything - I'm sorry, Mare. But I do think everything will get better. I don't know. Have you thought about maybe getting behind the wheel again? I think maybe if you did, your body would just know everything's okay. - You believe me about what happened, right? - When? - That night. I thought I hit something. The a Yeah. Uh, yeah, I also think it's possible that you saw something that wasn't actually there, because driving at night can be really scary. Mary, what are you looking at? - This is where that woman drowned. - What? - I saw a woman who died at the bottom of this bridge in my dream. - This specific bridge. - Yes. That's two nights in a ro I had another dream before this bridge one. There was this dead guy at this and then I found out that he actually died a couple of weeks ago in real life. Ugh! Like there's no service in this podunk town. - Okay, Mary, relax. It's okay. - Can you look on your phone? Look, look up people who died on this bridge, or search reports- - Okay. - Or something. - Okay. I don't have any service, so we can just look it up later. We don't need to look it up righ - It really happened. - I believe you. Like, I don't think you're crazy I've never thought you were craz What are you looking at? - Someone's been following me. ( - Mary, nobody's following you. There's no one there. - Look. - Mary, what, what are you looki Hey, just breathe. Just breathe. Just breathe. - It's okay. Sorry. Mary, you need to get real help, You have to see someone else, not just some doctor that's gonna pump you full of God knows what. Do something drastic. I don't know. Come to yoga with me. Anything that's gonna help you find inner peace. Okay? It's been a year of this. Enough is enough. Please just promise me you'll try something else. Someplace new. Just promise me. All right. Just promise me. - I promise. - Like tomorrow, like now, somep - Okay. - Okay, let's go home. Come on. - Okay. Hello. - Hm? Who's is this? Who is it? - Hi, I'm Mary. - Huh? - Do you do holistic practice? - Oh, okay. Thanks. I'm sorry to bother you. - Why? - Um, I saw your sign down the r and I've been taking these prescription medications for some sleep problems and othe Uh, I'm seeing a doctor already but it's not really working. I thought I'd try something new because of the nightmares. - C- come on. Come on in. You can sit there. Nightmares, h - Mm-hmm. - Your sleep must be fickle. - I don't sleep much, and when I that's when the, you know. - Mm-hmm. You wake up sweating. - Mm-hmm. - Screaming. - Mm-hmm. - Tell me, are you a God-fearing woman? - Uh, well I stopped going to church but I grew up Catholic. - Hm. - Um, I, I do believe that there's some higher power though, I guess. - Well, I can assure you there i How long have you been having trouble sleeping? - About a year. - And how's your life? - I guess you could say it's been a little stressful. - What's been stressful? - My parents, I guess. They've been having issues, and not sleeping is stressful, and I lost my job. - An unbalanced parental-offspri relationship is like a thorn stuck in your foot on your journey to serenity. Matthew 15:4, "For he who reviles his mother or father must surely die." - Is that your wife? - Yes, it is. - How long have you guys been to - We're not anymore. - I'm sorry. Well, thank you for talking to m - Do you want my help? - I'd love your help, but I can't pay very much. - Because you lost your job. - Yeah. - But I won't be late to any of your appointments ever. I have the time. - Mm-hmm. Maybe we can work something out. - Nah, I'm actually looking forward to it. - Did I hear that right? - I'm serious. He's a little on the religious s but he knows his stuff and I don He's calming. - Good for you, Mare. Happy for you. - Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday I was just frustrated and I took it out on you. I know you're trying to and you really have helped a lot - It's fine. I forgive you. - Thanks. - Has dad been back yet? - I have no idea. I'm the only one here right now. Trying to get out of here soon. Have you heard from him? - Nope. Not at all. - He's probably having fun with - Gross. - Mary. Hi, sweetheart. - Mom's here. I gotta go. - I, I didn't know you'd be here - I had some laundry to do. - Great. Hey, uh, did you hear about the Applebee's that's opening up over there on Fenning Ridge? Right next to Dr. Palmer's. How's Dr. Palmer been? - I'm actually seeing a new doct - Are you? Is everything - I'm fine. - Well, uh, if you need to borro to get to appointments, let me know, or you know, if you get a hot date with a pretty girl. - I know what you're doing. - I'm trying. - But why would you try for a di - After we, uh, do this we'll te to the seeds we planted last wee Gonna put fertil and then a soft layer of dirt on You know, Adam was the first far I'm sure he did something simila How are your parents? - My dad seems like he's okay. And I haven't talked to my mom in a couple weeks. Last time it wasn't great. She's probably fine. - She suffers silently like you. Have you told her about our new - Yeah, I did. - Did you tell her the nightmare - Not yet. So you really think it was the m that were causing my hallucinations and dreams? - A proper diagnosis is vital. Your circadian rhythm was off, which instigated the parasomnia and your sleep paralysis. Mary, come here. I want to show you something. When I first commenced my practice, it was more mainstream Prescribed pharmaceuticals and all that nonsense that you were taking. And I did notice that it was helping my patients, but it was merely hiding issues that were underneath. So I tried other things, things I should have been doing You know, the Good Book gives us from the garden for healing, but fewer people wanted to try it because it wasn't proven. Of course, there was one mishap with one of my more progressive techniques. It's been 10 years. This plant is native to a very specific region of Mes It's the Papaver plant. It's from the poppy family. - What's it do? - Well, it has very strong physiological effects and a powerful hypnotic property It's very potent. - It's beautiful. - I'm glad you think so. You know the reason that I'm showing you this, it's because healing is everywhe You just, uh, have to know where - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Let's tend to those seeds. - And in for three. Hold, and out. - Dude. - Whoa. - I literally feel high. No, like I'm actually high. - Yeah. - This new doc is genius. - Yeah, I'm starting to feel better about things. - I was really worried about you - You wanna make out, don't you? - What? No. - I mean, you're like looking at me like you want to. Okay. - I mean, I get it, you know? I know with this like, breath work and we're feeling good, and like I like boys. I also like Angelina Jolie. - Yeah. - But you already know all that. - Mm-hmm. - Oh! I almost forgot to tell you. I searched what we were talking about the other night. You know, about the deaths and stuff at that bridge. Did you look it up too? - Um, Dr. Cyrus thinks I shouldn't feed into my nightmare - Oh, okay. Well, do you wanna know or what? - Obviously, yes. - So I found this article about this woman that drowned at the same bridge. Did she look like this? Okay. It's okay. - We should go. Well, it sounds like you're actually getting som - I know, right? Geez I slept, I Running late. I slept through my - I wish we would've found this guy sooner. Glad last night was good for you - Yeah, and I slept. - I'm gonna call you Rip van Twinkle. - Um, hey, I'm here, so I gotta - Okay. Have a good session. - Hey. - Hello. - I'm seeing a boy. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - I saw it. - Hey, tell me what happened. Wh - I saw a ghost. - Okay, tell me what you saw. Just start from the beginning, o And then just back it up. - I was with my friend Jen last - Mm-hmm. - And I told her about my dream of the woman who drowned under the bridge. And she showed me a photo of the same woman who drowned under the same bridge a few year It was real. She was re And, and, just, just, just now- - Okay, okay. It's ok We're gonna try something. Remember when I told you how I had some mishaps with one of my techniques in the - One of the reasons your practice stopped. - Yes, but it wasn't my technique that was the problem. It was the person. You see, this has worked many times for many people. You have to absolutely follow everything I say in order for this to work. Now can you do that, Mary? Keep - Yes. - Close your eyes. Do you know what purgatory is, M Matthew 5:26. "You will never get out until you have paid the last penny." You see, your parents' divorce has triggered something in your spirit, and your unsettled spirit sees other unsettled spirits. Have you ever done anything you regret, Mary? Me too. What did you see, Mary? - I need to step outside. - Mary, it's important that you tell me what you saw, otherwise I can't- - I need a moment. - No. No. No. No. No. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hit you when I was driving. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. (gaspin - Mary. It's okay. It's okay. - I feel like I'm losi I can't tell what's real from what's not anymore. I don't know what to do. - Do you know what could, uh, help settle your mind? Believe it or not, a relationshi - Really? - Yeah. I mean, it's been proven that love can heal or at least distract you from th Do you have, uh, anyone special in your life? Boyfriend? - Can I tell you something? - Yeah, you can tell me anything - I like girls more, actually. - That's a very courageous thing for you to say out loud. I appreciate you sharing that personal information with me. Can I get you some more tea? - I'm good. Is this your wife? She's beautif - She was the most amazing woman on God's green earth.
