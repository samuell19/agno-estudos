'Dearest Anne. Life holds nothing for me but humiliation and poverty'. 'I prefer to die by my own hand. Maurice'. In the nick of time. Come in. What's the matter? Did you lose your nerve, Maurice? No. No, I was saving that for dessert. I should have known better. You couldn't go through with this kind of a trick. Trick? - Yes. It was the only way you could get me to come here, wasn't it. You're here, aren't you? I tried to see you. I phoned. I left messages. You didn't answer. - Why should I? I gave you $10,000 dollars six months ago. To go away and leave me alone. How time flies. And now look at me. Alone and penniless. Very nice of me to let you get away with it for $10,000, don't you think? You thought it was easy for me, didn't you. Just .. just picking $10,000 out of the air. It wasn't. It means lies, suspicion. I can't go on doing it Maurice. And I won't. I'm willing to settle once and for all. For $50,00 dollars. $50,000? But I haven't that much. - You can get it. No. - From your husband. Not without telling what want if for. - That's your problem. I can't do it, I tell you. I think you'd better arrange for it. Or I'll get it in another way that might be very unpleasant for you. Well. How do I know that this time you'll .. Keep your promise and really go away? After all we've been to each other, you don't trust me? Alright. Here. Phone me at this number tomorrow. No. You'd better make it Wednesday. You don't answer telephone calls. Only suicide notes. This is my private number. - That's different. Wednesday, what time? - Two o'clock. Not bad. Just for security in the meantime. You have your security. Let me go. I might give it back, if you'll stay. And the next time you try to kill yourself. Let me know. I'd love to help you. Oh. Schuyler, you .. you frightened me so. I'm sorry. I .. I must have dozed off. I didn't hear you come in. I've been in for some time. You must have come in very quietly. What made you run away so suddenly after dinner? I didn't run away. I .. I was tired and nervous. I just went for a drive. - Just for a ..? Oh. Of course. How foolish of me. Good heavens. It's almost ten o'clock. And I have a busy day ahead of me. Well. Goodnight. Oh, by the way. Why don't you come and have lunch with me at the office tomorrow? I can't, I'm .. I'm lunching with your sister. Sister? Yes. Oh, I see. Well, goodnight. Goodnight, Schuyler. 'Oct 12. Came home 10pm. Check on necklace and lunch with sister'. You sent for me, sir? You drove Mrs Brooks last night, didn't you? Yes, sir. I have forgotten where she went. Where was it? We just drove around. Did Mrs Brooks get out of the car? Yes. For a couple of minutes. Where? I don't remember. Maybe it was a shop. A shop, eh? Is that all? - I think so, sir. When Mrs Brooks came out of the shop .. Did you notice if she was still wearing her jewellery, her necklace? No, sir. The shower is ready, sir. - Thanks. Grover. You should watch your mistress more closely when she's in your care. That's all. - Yes, sir. Yes, yes darling. I'm listening. You say you were just seventeen when you met this Maurice? Too young to know anything except that I wanted to dance. He took me as his partner and .. But of course, I fell in love with him. When he saw we were becoming successful he asked me to marry him. I know now, all he wanted was to tie me to him. Oh, it didn't take me long to find out what he really was. It was pretty awful. Anyway, I .. I stood it as long as I could. One day I refused to dance. Then he said he wanted to divorce me. Said he was in love with somebody else. Well I .. I told him to go ahead. And while he was getting it, I came back to America. And met Schuyler Brooks. Yes. The rest you know. Six months after I was married, Maurice showed up. He hadn't gone through with the divorce. He'd lied to me. Good heavens. I gave him ten thousand dollars to go back to Europe and complete the divorce. He didn't do it. Now he wants fifty thousand. The wretch. He's given me a week. I can't raise that amount of money without Schuyler knowing about it. Already, he's suspicious. He watches every move I make. - Jealous old idiot. Alright. We'll get that marriage quietly annulled somewhere out of the country. Paris, Cuba, Mexico. You don't know Maurice. Thank heaven. He'd follow me anywhere. - Then that's the solution. What? This Maurice person isn't an American, is he? No. And if you make him follow you out of the States .. I'll stop him from every getting back. You'll stop him? My dear, I haven't been in this social business forty years for nothing. A man of his character? One little telephone call to Washington would cancel his visa. Like that. Five threes are fifteen. Five hundred. Five thousand and twenty-five. Five sixes are thirty. Five thousand. Twenty-eight. I tell you, Schuyler. Ten million is cheap for that string of bar companies. I recommend the roast duck, too. In the same breath? You are not eating, dear. I know, but I can't. Come, it isn't every day .. We have a beautiful woman for luncheon with us, eh Schuyler? What's the matter? Tired, I guess. I wish I could go away somewhere for a while. The wanderlust, eh? How about a chocolate ?clair? No thanks. - Perhaps you should see Dr Graham? I'm not ill, darling. Just fidgety and nervous. Yes, I've noticed that. I'm .. I'm not sleeping well, either. Ever count sheep? That reminds me. Let me have some of that cold lamb. Couldn't we go away together somewhere? Not just now I couldn't. Business. Well, would you mind if .. If I went away alone for a couple of weeks? You could join me later. Where would you like to go? Oh, I don't know. Bermuda .. or Cuba. I think I'd like Havana. If Schuyler can't go, how about me, Anne? That would be too perfect. When would you like to go? Any time. Tomorrow. I could pack in an hour. So soon? - The sooner the better. Well, very well my dear, I will arrange it. Thank you, darling. Of course you will take your maid? No. I think I'd rather go alone. Very well, just as you like. And to make it quite perfect, I'd like to go under my own name. That would be sort of fun. - You don't like his? It isn't that. I don't want publicity. That's all. I just want be plain Anne Vallee. I want to get on that big white boat. Sit on a deckchair and relax. Forget everything. Well, if I'm really going tomorrow I have a lot to do. Mind if I run along? - No, no. Of course not. Goodbye, darling. - Bye, dear. See you tomorrow. - Yes. You'd better tell your wife you really want to come along with me. Goodbye. - Yes, goodbye. You'll see about my tickets, dear? - I'll talk care of it. Thank you. - Goodbye. Why, we have connections and agencies all over the world. We have offices in London. Yes I know. I took the trouble to investigate you before I came. Thank you. You make a speciality of shadowing women, I understand? We've handled some of the best cases. Yes. This is a very confidential case. It requires a special operative. One who is capable of .. - Aha. He must be a gentleman of tact, of honesty. One who knows how to .. - I know who you want. Hank? - "Yes?" Come in my office right away, will you. - "Okay." I got just the man for your case. A gentleman in every respect. Please. - Why, what's the trouble? He won't do. You got me wrong. - What do you mean? The man I want ain't here. I got to send for him. Find Davis. I don't know where he is but find him. It's a cinch. Sit down. Don't be nervous. Everything is going to be alright. 311? There is a raid In 412. Yeah, okay. Hiya, Joe. - Yeah, don't get worried. Okay. Number 10. Mr Smith? Desk clerk calling. Sorry to bother you, but there is a raid on the fourth floor. Yeah. Thought you might like to know. 543, Mr Smith? There is a raid in 412. Yeah. Don't get worried. Alright. Want to wait, Mr Smith? - Hey, Joe. Same room. There is a raid in the hotel. Fourth floor. Okay. 601? Hello Mr Smith. There's a raid in 412. Fourth please. Pardon me. - I beg your pardon. Pardon me. - Pardon me. Up or down, Mr Smith? Down! Well, Governor. There's your evidence. Hiya, Hank. - Hi, George. And I believed in you and trusted you. And now. Haven't you got anything to say at all? You've been two-timing your husband with every tramp in town, haven't you? Well, I think he's a swell guy and he deserves a divorce. Goodbye, Mrs Smith. The boss wants you at the office. Pronto. What, again? Someday, I'm going to find me a nice monastery .. Where I'll never see another scheming female as long as I live. Hello Mack. Have you heard from Davis? Oh yes. Send him in right away. Okay. He'll be here in a minute, Mr Brooks. Good afternoon, Mr Davis. How have you been, Mr Weems. Mr Davis - Mr Brooks. How do you do. - How do you do. If you two gentlemen will excuse me, I'll .. Leave you to discuss the matter alone. Scram. Sit down. - Thanks. You wish to see me? - Yes. You .. know this woman? That's one I've missed. She is sailing tomorrow evening for Havana. Why? That's the point. I see. Name please? Anne Vallee. Anne. Vallee. - Yes. Miss or Mrs? - Uh .. Miss. Suite 7C. Cuban Mail. Santiago? - Yes. I am .. I am rather interested in this young lady and she is sailing alone. I thought it well to have someone who would protect her against .. Chance acquaintances, emotional accidents. You see, she must have companionship of some sort and .. I prefer to have someone in my employ. Someone who could gain her confidence. And find out whether she's capable of having those .. Emotional accidents. No. Certainly not. I trust her absolutely. Well who do you suspect? - No-one. Or everyone? - But .. Yes I know. I know. Your world is built on chivalry and the fair name of woman. Mine isn't. That's why you're here. You want me to find out something that you yourself don't even dare to think. Alright. All I need is an unlimited expense account .. and time. You will send me a report every day? - Certainly. I'll give you my private address. You'll be prepared to fly to Cuba for the pay-off? The what? Well, you want to be in at the kill, don't you? I don't understand. I mean. Seeing is believing. Oh yes, but there will absolutely no necessity for that. Just the same, you'd better keep a suitcase packed. This will cover transportation and expenses. Thanks very much. You will come to see me in the morning for final instructions? Good afternoon, Mr Brooks. Good afternoon, Mr Davis. And thank you. You're welcome. When do we sail? Oh those rubber ears of yours are going to get you into trouble someday. I always wanted to go to Cuba. - Well, join the Navy. You got a big expense account and I ain't busy. Listen Hank, you're alright for climbing in windows and breaking down doors. But this isn't that kind of a case. I got to go. Oh, a dame? Yeah. In a way. Why not hire a private detective? Her sister is related to Mickey Walker's sparring partner. You know one thing about being a valet? - Who me? Say, I'm the last word in valets. Well, you'll have to sleep in the steerage with other servants. Get me out of town and I'll sleep with the anchor. That's all, Lucille. I'll finish the rest. Very well madam. Now don't worry. Our strategy can't fail. I've planned it all as carefully as a Field Marshall. I suppose I should take the letters and papers for the attorney there in case .. Yes, of course. Certainly, certainly. Take everything and put them away very carefully. [ Telephone ] Wait a minute. That may be Maurice. Hello? Mrs Brooks? Who is calling please? Well I'm sorry, but she's not here. She'll talk to me. Just tell her who is calling. I'm sorry, but I don't think I can reach her. She is sailing this evening for Cuba. Cuba? Why yes, of course. What boat is she sailing on? I'd like to send her some flowers. On the Cuban Mail. The Santiago, I believe. Yes. That's right. Alright. Goodbye. Is it alright? Your dear Mr Maurice will be on that boat in person or I don't know my men. May I see the passenger list please? - Why, certainly. Thank you. 'The well-trained valet will always unpack his master's baggage at once'. 'And hang his clothes'. You did all this yourself? - All by my lonesome, boss. 'The well-trained valet will always unpack his master's baggage at once'. 'And hang his clothes on hangers to avoid creasing'. No. I can see that you're going to be a great help to me. Now go up on deck and find the steward .. And see that he places my chair next to Miss Anne Vallee's tomorrow. It may cost you a little extra money, but see that it gets there. Pay him out of the expense money I gave you. Leave it to me, boss. It's practically done. May I see the passenger list, please? - Certainly. Thank you very much. Is this it? - No. I had five bags. There are only four here now. It's a small tan suitcase about this size. The same kind of leather as that one. I tell you it isn't here. - Very well, I'll look for it. I beg your pardon. Is this what you're looking for? Yes, of course it is. Thank you so much. It got into my room by mistake. I was going to take it to the purser's office. Oh, I am terribly sorry to have caused you so much trouble. Quite alright. No trouble at all, only .. Well you can imagine my embarrassment when my valet opened it. How are you? - How do you do, sir. How do you know it when you're twelve miles out? By the passengers. Make mine a big whiskey and a small soda. Just a minute, sir. Is it going to be rough? - I think it will be. [ Clock chimes ] So that's the drinking signal? The bell? Saved by the bell. A blue diamond fizz. Not too much sugar. What, madam? A blue diamond fizz. I don't want it too sweet. I don't think I ever heard of that. I can make you a New Orleans fizz or .. Oh, the service on this line is like a cattle boat. Well, if you give me an idea what it's made of .. Never mind, never mind. I'll have an ordinary champagne cocktail. You've heard of that, haven't you? - Yes, madam. Tell me. Is the Duke of Wessex aboard? I don't think he's with us on this trip. Perhaps it's just as well. The Duchess gets so jealous every time Robert speaks to me. How is that, madam? Atrocious. What kind of champagne? Pol Roger 1915. It would be on this tub. I don't suppose you have any Veuve Clicquot 1906? I'm sorry. Well .. can you change a hundred-dollar bill? No madam, I can't. Really this is intolerable. How can you expect .. Pardon me. Would you allow me, madam? Allow you to do what? - I mean .. As long as you've no small change on you I thought I may sort of buy you a drink. Yes, if you wish. Are you .. Travelling by yourself? Uhuh. So am I. That's swell. What is swell? Nothing. Let's skip it. Ah, the bell again. Happy days. - You're a droll person. You said it. A laugh a minute. That's me. Never a dull moment when I'm around. Oh keep the change, my man. - Thank you. Certainly my good man. Keep the change. Here it is, Miss. Isn't there a place I can be alone? - Sorry Miss, but it's very difficult. Well you may move mine, steward. It doesn't matter to me where I sit. Well I guess it will be alright. Please don't let me disturb you. Thank you. Miss Vallee. Not at all. Mr Davis. You know, this is twice that you've been very nice to me. That makes the score 2-0 in your favor. - Not quite. No? No, I have a confession to make. I had my chair moved over here deliberately. Really? Yes. The woman who sat next to me talked too much. I see. I hope you don't mind. - No. No, not at all. The feeling is quite mutual. I love silence. Then the score is even. Hi-ho the bell. - Cheerio. What did you say your name was? - Wales. Oh, not the ..? - Hank Wales. U.S.A. Well as I was saying, Mr Wales. A wealthy woman alone, unprotected. Knowing nothing of the world. Everyone preys on her. The rats. But let's not talk about me anymore. Let's talk about you. What business did you say you were in? Well, I'm .. I'm associated with my father. Your father? And what does he do? He is retired. You don't say. My father is retired too. Now, ain't that a coincidence. Just a couple of lonely souls whose parents have retired. It's a sad thought. Up the bell again. Gar?on? - Yes, ma'am? Two more. Two champagne cocktails. So, you're going to Cuba to look over the family tobacco plantation? Oh, what a bore. But that isn't as bad as our mines in Alaska .. Or our mahogany forest in Yucatan. Forests are so .. We had some spruce land in Oregon .. But father swapped it in for a couple of old banks just before he retired. Oh tell me, dear Mr Wales. Where is your family home? Well, we sort of .. move around. Every fall we go to the springs. And every spring we go to the falls. Oh, you naughty, naughty boy. You're spoofing. You're spoofing me. Now remember, I'm paying for this round. Not a chance. Don't even mention it. I insist. Can you change a $100 bill? - I don't think so, madam. Keep the change, my good man. - Oh, thank you, sir. You must never offer to pay for anything else again when I'm around. There hasn't been a gigolo in the Wales' family for generations. Here we go, laughing and scratching. Here we go. Join me in a cocktail? - No thank you. Pardon me. - What is it? Oh, who is that good-looking man? He's my valet. He is always spying on me. I want to fire him but he's been in the family for years and years and years. I'll see you tonight. See you later perhaps? - Perhaps. Give me a straight whiskey. Did you lose him? - Lose him? Me? Boy, the only way they get away from me is to jump overboard. I thought you always went First Class? What are you doing with that slug? The depression hit me. Come on, give. - Nix. Wait until we dock. Give. 20 champagne cocktails at two bucks a smash and about 30 bucks in tips. And don't hold out on me or I'll switch him to whiskey at half a buck a snort. You didn't get away with it, my dear. It doesn't look that way, does it. - Just what do you think you'll do now? I give in. You win. Smart girl. I haven't much money with me now. But .. I'll manage to cash a check as soon as we land. Can I depend on that? You have me cornered. What else can I do? You can add an extra couple of thousand to the original amount .. For the expenses of this trip and for trying to run out on me. Meantime, maybe we can act like human beings and enjoy this voyage together. You'll get your money when I land and that's all. Another one, please. - Yes, sir. Very dry. What about that cocktail? - What? Make it two, please. Sit down, won't you. So, you've changed your mind? Do you do that often? - Often. What would you say if I asked you to have dinner with me? I'd probably say no. Oh. What's the matter? Something wrong? No, I think I'll tell you the truth. There is a certain man on this boat that I don't like. Who, me? No. - Oh. Are you good at rescuing ladies? - Oh yes. Who is the man? A stranger. So am I. Yes, But you are the lesser of two evils, Mr Davis. Thank you. Miss Vallee. A Clover Club, please. What about that dinner? - Thanks. Got my things ready? The book says the valet will place the necessary studs in shirts. Say boss, what's in a champagne cocktail? Here .. look in the book. [ Bell chimes ] Oh, the bell. I can't keep up with that goldarned bell. '2pm. She is not interested in boat flirtation'. '5pm. Cocktails together'. 'She has a lovely smile'. She has a lovely smile, eh? A nice tune, isn't it. Looking at the moonlight? Stars? No. I was listening to the music. It is a nice tune. A funny thing. Big boat. It's all a little world in itself. A world made of steel plates. A scant half inch between us and the bottom of the sea. Sounds dangerous. It is dangerous. Perhaps it's a good thing we're arriving at Havana tomorrow. But there will be moonlight and music and stars after tomorrow. You want that? I'm afraid not. Not after tomorrow. I was pretty good at the waltz too. But I never did like the rumba. I think you have to be Spanish to like it, don't you? Oh really, you are a scream. Isn't it romantic up here in the moonlight. All that ..? Yeah. You do say such utterly charming things. Say, that's as well hunk of ice. That? That's been in my family for years. Abraham Lincoln gave it to my grandmother. A historical ruin, huh? - What? Not your grandmother .. the ring. Mother gave it to me when I graduated from the convent last year. Abraham Lincoln. Now, who'd have thought it? Hey. Look! Your ring. I dropped it. - You what? It's gone overboard. - My ring? My beautiful lovely ring. Oh, my heart is broken. Oh my ring, my ring. Now wait a minute, Dot. Don't get hysterical. What will father say? He won't forgive me. I'll buy you a new one in Havana. - Oh, my. I'll buy you a bracelet. Earrings. The whole jewellery store. Don't get sore at me. I've got to go. - What's happened now? I got to feed my goldfish. - I love goldfish. No. You stay here. My goldfish is afraid of strangers. Are you a girl who leaves a little champagne in the bottom of her glass? Meaning what? Meaning you're leaving half a night full of moonlight. Music. Untouched. Are you afraid to empty the glass? No. But I don't like hangovers. Goodnight, Mr Davis. Goodnight, Miss Vallee. I .. '10am. Conversation. 12:30pm. Lunch. 4pm. Cocktails. 7pm. Dinner. '9pm. Danced. 11pm. Went to bed'. 'Alone'. As soon as we dock I'll get a taxi .. - You are very kind but .. I think we had better say goodbye here. I don't see why. - Many reasons. Won't you even let me see you to your hotel? As a matter of fact, I'm going to visit a friend at a plantation out of town. That's funny. I'm headed for a plantation too. Really? Where? Just north of Havana. Oh, that's too bad. My friends are just south of the city. Oh, I see. Goodbye, Mr Davis. Good luck, Miss Vallee. Are all my bags here? - Yes, madame. They are all tagged. Yes, Hotel Metropole. - Any other wish, madame? That is all, thank you. Did you get it? - Yeah. Hotel Metropole. That's where we go. Send the bags ahead. - Okay. Hello Hank. - Hello Dot. Very sorry, Miss. But .. - What's the matter? What is it? I have no change. Have you any money on you? - Sure. What do you need? Fifty dollars. Just a few telegrams. Radio calls. It's a pleasure. Thank you, sir. What hotel are you going to? - Hotel Metropole. What a coincidence. So am I. - Yeah? That's swell. I'll see you later. Hotel Metropole. Hotel Metropole. Hotel Metropole. [ Telephone ] Hello? Greetings, my dear. No, I'm not at the Metropole. I couldn't afford it. Though I've found a very comfortable little place just around the corner. Where I can always be nearby. I've already cabled New York. The money should be here in less than a week. No, please don't come here. You will spoil everything. Call me in a day or so and I'll have some news for you. You know I can't run away again. Where shall I run to? Now don't be impatient Maurice. Goodbye. 'Portia DeWitt Brooks. 1172 Park Avenue. New York'. 'Everything worked as expected'. 'Am stalling for time until I hear from you'. Hey boss. She just sent a cablegram. - Where? Someone in New York. Didn't get the name. Okay, beat it. Are you, you? - I'm afraid I am. I don't believe it. You're meant to be with friends on a plantation somewhere. They .. they went fishing. Oh .. fishing? They won't be back for a week. - Hmm. But .. where did your friends go? Fishing. Let me see what you've got here. That's awful. Take it away. - Leave it there. That's terrible. Take that away. Take the whole thing away. But Se?or ..? Never mind that. Never mind. You idiot. What can I do with you? Have dinner with me. Yes. Bring that table over here. I hope you don't mind. I don't see what I can do about it. - Exactly. But I ordered something special that I'm sure you'll like. Do you like squab? No. - I thought so. Are we starting this over again? No we're going to go on from where we left off. You're a most annoying person, Mr Davis. I don't really know what to say to you. Call me 'Neil'. That's my first name. Alfredo. Wine list, please. - Si, Se?or. Here. - Thank you very much. There you are. These things are all so lovely, but that ring .. Oh, that is just too divine. Like it? - Yes, but .. Then it's yours. Let's see that one. It's simply exquisite. But Hank dear, I couldn't accept this kind of a present from you. Sure you can. - But think of my reputation. What would father say? - I owe you this. Didn't I lose your other ring? - Yes, but after all .. Do you like it? - I adore it. Then we'll take it. How much? - Five hundred dollars. Oh, a magnificent bargain sir. I assure you. Why, the setting alone is worth twice that. You know, I really shouldn't do this. Neither should I. - What? However. You're such a sweet, generous ducky-wucky. Let's go to some nice quiet place where I can really thank you. Why not? Good day, my good man. - Good day, madame. Good day, sir. Thank you so much. I'd like to have you come in again sometime. Forgive me. I had to do that. Why? Because you're lovely. It would have happened anywhere. Believe me. This isn't going to work out so well. Don't .. Don't go. It's been so beautiful. Let's not spoil it. How much more beautiful it would be. Riding along the old sea wall. - Neil, please. Or walking down those old twisted streets. All full of moonlight and guitars. I've got to go. - Oh, don't. Please don't. Room clerk, please. Hello. This is Miss Vallee. Room 212. Have you another suite available? On a different floor? Yes, thank you. Would you move me right away? Right now. Yes. Thank you so much. 'She spent the day alone in her room and sent cable to New York this evening'. 'Had dinner with her on her balcony. Davis'. 'Sent cable to New York this evening'. Did I get a cable from Mrs Brooks today? No, sir. I wonder who did. Another cold towel, sir? - Bring a dozen. Yes, sir. Just over here. There. Nothing else, sir? Not a thing. She'll be right out. - Bon app?tit. Listen, young man. If you don't quit cutting up didos on my front porch I'll call the manager. Hey, Hank. Hank. Come on, get up. Get up. What for? It ain't noon yet. - She's gone. Who? Dot? No. Miss Vallee. She slipped out during the night. Come on, get you clothes and meet me in the lobby. I'm all in. I had a tough night. - A tougher day if you don't get up. I'm quitting this detective racket anyway. There is nothing in it, boss. You are what? - I'm going where I am appreciated. I'm going to marry about ten million bucks and be a gentleman. Say, how about wiring Brooks for more expense money? What? How much money we got left, Mr Treasurer? Oh plenty, plenty. If we run short I'll supply the deficiency. Come on, get up. - You think I'm kidding? Last night she asked me to manage her estates for her. James. Hand me my socks. Why, I'll hand you a sock if you don't get up. Oh, she won't disappear. You act like you were stuck on the dame. - You sap. Why don't you be like me? Nonchalant. Has Miss Vallee gone out? Look and see if the key is there, will you please. No, sir. She is not in. What's her number? I'd like to call her on the phone. 621. The house telephone is right across the lobby. Thank you. Any answer? Tell him .. - Yes, madame? Tell him that I .. No, don't say anything. - Don't say anything? No. - Yes, madame. Hello? Do you realize that I've been waiting for you for over 15 minutes? This won't do at all. How dreadful. Please go right ahead. No. No I don't eat lunch. Besides, I'm not dressed. - Fine, I'll be right up. No, no. Don't do that. Now what do you want to hang around a hotel room for? When we can get into one of those old carriages and ride along the sea wall. Palm trees rustling and .. Huh? Sure they rustle. It's absolutely impossible. I tell you I can't go. No .. no! Quaint streets. Genuine antiques. Discovered by Columbus in 1492, huh? How much longer is this going to go on? - We'll be out of this pretty soon. You are persistent, aren't you. - Have you noticed that? Who are you? What are you? I am your shadow. What an amusing occupation. - Uhuh. I'm enjoying it. Aren't you? Well, you are doing very well at it. Amateur or professional? What do you think? - I don't know. When did you start? The first day I saw you on the boat. - You've been following me ever since? Why sure. I've watched every move you've made. Why? That's my business. Ooh. Tired? - No. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. It was worth coming all the way down here just to see you. You aren't afraid of me any more now, are you? It's not you I'm afraid of. Why, you sound as though you were running away from something. I am. A beautiful fugitive, eh? Do you know men have died over things like that? It will be dark by the time we get back. I'll order a little Cuban twilight. Do you mind? Hey Gus. The Hotel Metropole. - Si, Se?or. I've ordered dinner on my balcony for exactly seven-thirty. You are awfully sure of yourself aren't you? You are not very sure of yourself, are you. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Anne, you look gorgeous. Sit down won't you. I'll be with you as soon as I've finished this love letter. Love letters don't look so well on a typewriter you know. Well this is an elderly person who wants to know all my secrets every day. Send her my love. - Oh, it's a 'he'. Well. Send him my love. - Alright. I will. 'Looks promising. She is dining with me in my room this evening. Stop'. 'Here she is now. Stop'. 'She sends you her love. (Joke)'. Hey Gus or Pedro or whatever your name is. You savvy Western Union? - Si. Send that right away will you please. - Si, Se?or. Good boy. Here you are. What do you see? Beautiful, isn't it. Houses so white. Way off there somewhere is New York. Why mention that? I'm conscious of it. I feel it watching, waiting. Spying on everything I do. Silly, isn't it? Yes. Very. I have to go back in a few days. Why? Because I must. You know, Anne. Sometimes, you're very mysterious. Let's .. let's have dinner in .. In one of those strange restaurants in the old town. Shall we? And forget New York? Forget New York. Let's go. 'Looks promising. She is dining with me in my room this evening. Stop'. 'Here she is now. Stop'. 'She sends you her love. (Joke)'. '10am. Conversation. 12:30pm. Lunch. 4pm. Cocktails'. '7pm. Dinner. 9pm. Danced. 11pm. Went to bed alone'. Private Detective indeed. You old fossil. She did it for me. Good heavens, what have I done to her? Why didn't you tell me of this before? You wouldn't have understood. That's why she went to Cuba. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. I've got to get to her at once before it's too late. Well it serves you right. Hiring a detective to see if your wife is faithful. I always said you were an old fool. Please. Please, I must get to her. Edward. Get me the airport on the telephone at once. And get me Western Union please. - Right, sir. If I can get a special plane first thing in the morning, will you go with me? I wouldn't fly across the street for any woman's honor. Last day, Neil. I'm going back tomorrow. Formal dinners, boring teas and society. I'd like to sink every New York boat in the harbor. I still have to go back. I'll go with you. - That's just it. You can't. - Who's going to stop me? Neil. I haven't been very honest with you. First it didn't matter much but .. I found something here that I've always been looking for. I can't go on with this any longer. Why don't you tell me what it's all about? Oh I guess there are plenty of women married to one man .. Playing around with another, but .. - Are you married? Yes. I didn't know that. To whom? Ever hear of Schuyler Brooks? Is he your husband? Oh. I see. Now you understand why I have to go back alone. But .. why are you so unhappy? You see Neil, six months after I married Schuyler .. Well, that's the story. There is still Maurice. And a rotten blackmail plot. Sounds like a nightmare. You called me a fugitive once. Remember? What makes you trust me so much? I don't know. I just do. Let's get married right away. What are we waiting for? - Now, darling. You must give me time to notify my family. Think of the shock to father. Why, he'd cut off my stipend. Oh, we can't let that happen. Oh, you are such a lamb. And so good to poor little me. Father will simply adore you. By the way, speaking of father. Did your allowance check come? - Oh, well .. Not yet .. but as soon as it does .. I'm going to pay you back all that money you loaned me for my hotel bill. Oh, I .. I beg your pardon. What did you have to come back for? Well, I'm sorry. But I live here. I want to see you. - Me? Not you, dear. Come on, Hank. I want to see you. That guy is getting in my hair. I'm going to fire him. Oh, I wouldn't do that. He is really awfully good looking. Now I am going to fire him. This is Mr Davis in 214. Any messages for me please? A cablegram? Well, I didn't receive any cablegram. Oh, you gave it to Mr Wales? I see, Thank you. I've been sort of busy today. I guess I forgot to give it to you. Forgot to give it to me? What a swell detective you turned out to be. Shush. Don't say anything about me being a detective. She might hear you. Detective? Then maybe she wouldn't marry me. I can always be a detective but I can't always marry a million bucks. 'Arriving 6:30 this evening by plane. Brooks'. You ain't sore at me are you? Someday you're going to drop dead from brain fatigue. Say, what's the matter with you? You act like you've fallen for the dame. - I have. Sucker. He's fired, honey. Neil. I didn't hear you. You're right on time. Well. - Anne. 'Neil Davis. Hotel Metropole. Havana. Arriving 6:30 by plane his evening'. What? It's addressed to you. He doesn't know you. Or does he? Neil, does he? - Yes, he does. What? He'll be here in a moment. And .. I can't go through with it. I can't. What are you talking about? Don't you realize what I am? Can't you see that ever since you left New York I've been following you? Don't you understand? Neil. Neil, you ..? Oh, no. Anne, I .. Listen, Anne. All the while we've been together, I've been a paid spy. In the employ of that man. Sent to follow you. To make your acquaintance and report your actions. And tell him what kind of a woman you really are. Now, in moments, there's a knock on the door and he'll walk in. And find us. I'm supposed to hold you in my arms. Just as he walks in. That's what he paid his money to see. But Anne, I can't do it. I'm not a private detective anymore. I'm not a sneak. I'm just someone who loves you. Believe me. I do love you. [ Door knocks ] [ Door knocks ] Maurice. Davis. Mr Brooks, why ..? - Yes. How do you do. - How do you do. Where is she? - Oh, I .. Why, she's in her room. Alone. Tell me quickly. Is it too late? You know what I mean. You haven't ..? - Oh that. Why no. You've been quite mistaken about Mrs Brooks. Oh. Then you know that she is my .. - Yes. Yes. Oh. Well I will go to her. - Just a moment. Suppose she were to find out that I were a private detective .. Hired by you to .. Well, to frame her. - She must never know it. I depend upon you to keep it a secret. - Then you must let me see her first. Three minutes is all I need, just to tell her that I've been called away .. And to say goodbye, and then she won't be suspicious. Then you can happen along and she won't be any the wiser. Alright, but be quick about it. - Alright. Just three minutes. Yes. Maurice, stop it. You're drunk. - I'll take these to start with. Let go of me. Neil. Ah, so that's the way it is. Who is he? Quick. - Maurice. I thought so. Listen. Your husband is on his way here now. And he's got to find you alone. You heard me. Get out! What for? - Why I'll .. Just as you wish. Of course, if you're smart you'd realize that if Mr Brooks catches you here .. It's all over with you and your little game. You think so? That's the trouble with you amateur blackmailers. You're always spilling the beans too soon. You're well informed aren't you. That's my business. What is this, a frame up? - Yes. And you fell for it. Listen you mug, I've been trailing you for weeks. Now that I've found you I must let you go. Not because I'm big hearted. But to save that woman .. so I'll give you thirty minutes head start. You haven't even got a warrant. - A warrant? I've a couple of cops coming here with Mr Brooks .. And if you don't clear out by that time .. Out that window and across to the next room. Quick. It's a cinch. I've got to go now. Goodbye and good luck. Wait a moment. - What? Anne. Anne. Are you there? Come in. Anne. This was what you paid your money to see, wasn't it? I wouldn't disappoint you for anything, Schuyler. You double-crossing .. - Now wait a minute. Keep out of this. My sister told me everything. I came to take you back. No, Schuyler. I'm not going back with you now or ever. You've destroyed what little there was between us. I tried to be fair. But you've hounded me and spied on me since the first day we married. Then you deliberately put a man in front of me you thought I'd fall in love with. Hoping that I wouldn't because you still wanted to keep me. And yet, down in your dirty little mind you were wondering if I would. But Anne, you are my wife. If your sister told you everything you know that I'm not your wife. Yes, but my lawyer can arrange all that. - You don't believe in evidence, do you. Evidence? - Yes. What you saw when you came into this room is true. Mr Brooks .. - I'll pay you off. Now please get out. - Sorry, You don't owe me a thing. As long as Anne has seen fit .. - Shut up. I picked you up out of nothing. You can go back to nothing for all I care. I don't know what to say. I .. I feel that I am to blame for the whole mess. No-one is to blame. It just had to happen, I guess. A funny thing. We worry and struggle and .. Try to work out our little problems. And all of a sudden it's over. Like that. It just doesn't seem possible. Hello, Mr Brooks. How have you been? Fancy meeting you here. - Why, you .. you .. Get out of my way. That's life. Here today, gone tomorrow. It's Maurice. Oh. Oh, how awful. Listen, Anne .. the police will be here in moments. They'll want explanations and we'll have to give them. Where are those documents? Quick. Hurry. They are right here where I left them. There you are. Where is that suicide note you told me about? Here it is. 'Dearest Anne. Life holds nothing for me but humiliation and poverty'. 'I prefer to die by my own hand. Maurice'. That's what I need. ..s-d..
