(majestic music) (dramatic music) (helicopter engine roars) [Pilot] We'll reach the target, just a few seconds more. Follow the enemy troops. We're going down now. (dramatic music) (explosions boom) (men screaming) (guns fire) Run in there! Come on, move it! Down! Go. Forward! Charge! (guns fire) (men screaming) [Soldier] Sir? Sir? You can come in. Commander Han, Mr. Torosky's here to see you. - Send him in. - Right. - Sit down. - Thank you. I'm Torosky. We understand you are fighting a tough war here. We'll do everything we can to support you. But the American's, they're very strong. They made this tough war to fight. We are aware of the situation. The Americans ain't stupid. And we also know that they have guerrillas fighting on their side. Right, we've also received news that a new platoon of American soldiers has raided us. Commander, you should send in a team to destroy them. No, I can't spare the men. All right then. What do you have in mind? This is my plan, to get the guerrillas before an attack on the Americans! Good idea, commander. Our group will join your guerrilla forces as a subdivision. It will carry out a diversion to wipe them out. That's a good plan Mr. Torosky. You've done a lot for us, what can we do in return? We need more supplies of your weapons, and your ammunition was supplied by Russians. We'd like to have a small portion. How about it? Well, I think I can arrange it for tomorrow. Yes, I can definitely arrange it for tomorrow. All right, thank you very much. (dramatic music) Keep going, come on! Come on, hurry. C'mon! Come on! Hurry up! Hurry, come on, move! Hurry, go on! Go, come on! (explosions boom) (gun fires) (man groans) (explosions boom) (man groans) Jesus Christ! You okay? I'm okay. Let's get the fuck outta here, c'mon. (gun fires) (man groans) (man groans) Take off! (explosion booms) (men groan) (dramatic music) Let's split up here, all right Black? Yeah, right. You take care. Okay. (dramatic music) That way. (gun fires) (man groans) Come on, let's move outta here! (dramatic music) (man groans) (gun fires) (men groan) Come on, come on! (guns fire) (man groans) (man yells) (dramatic music) (yelling) (man groans) (gun fires) (man groans) (man groans) (man groans) Well done! (explosion booms) Black! Black, Black? (dramatic music) Come on! (guns fire) (birds chirp) So you recovered? Yeah, I fell unconscious for five fuckin' days! How you doin', man? Fortunately it's only muscle damage. I'll be okay. What about Jimmy and his team? They've been completely wiped out. Godammit, those rotten sons of bitches. Boy, looks like the nightmare's just begun. Major Max decided to setup a new platoon of guerrilla forces. We'll have enrolled in one of the squads when you're better. I'm sick of this fight! [Soldier] Who isn't? The thing is, the war is nobody's fault. They can't blame it on us! Yeah, well I don't care who wins! Care for those numbers that are our army being killed! Some of them are our friends! I don't know why we have to get involved in this business anyway! [John] We're doing our duty. Bullshit! It's bullshit! It's to safeguard democracy. That's their fuckin' excuse anyway! (dramatic music) Ah, there it is. Cambodia border's 10 miles from here, commander. All right, gimmie the map. Yeah, this should be the place. We can't go any further because there are several villages on the other side of the mountain. They seem very friendly to me, though. All right then George, we'll setup camp here tonight. Set the tents up! Go on you guys. - Right! - Yeah, okay. Alrighty boss! Let's go. Man, it doesn't feel like we're on a mission at all. It feels more like a vacation. (laughs) That's what you think. This is only the beginning. Things'll get a lot tougher. The communists could attack any time. Yep. But we'll beat the communists, right? Yeah, I hope so. Just be aware, the communists aren't stupid. I'll help put the tents up. All right, you, Timothy and James go prepare the meal, all right? And we're running out of water. You're responsible for the water supply. Take two men with you to get a refill. [Woman] Yes sir. Commander, you wanted to see me? You're responsible for the security, all right? Right! Once we get settled down, I'm gonna contact the Americans to discuss our next move. They'll never know that we surrounded 'em. We need this surprise attack to wipe 'em out. I hope that the war will be over then. This could be it. Why don't you draft a schedule for the night shift? I'll have it done by noon, okay? I hope the enemy doesn't find out about us. This surprise attack could be the turning point for us. Yep. George, we must win the war. We'll try our best. I guess the rest we'll have to leave to faith. Right, we'll go down in history. For sure. (dramatic music) (groaning) (women gasp) Oh Amy? Amy, Amy get up then! Amy? Amy! Amy, are you okay, Amy? (dramatic music) What happened? Is there anything I can do? I dunno what happened. She fainted on me. Please help me. (groaning) Shit. Something's wrong! What the fuck happened to you Andy? Tell me, you all right? Hey, who did this to you? There were two of them, from the other side of the mountain. But no one lives there, who are they? I'm not sure, they could be guerrillas. They both have guns, there must be others. They must be from the South then. I knew they would come. You don't have to worry about a thing. The terrorists are on our side. We have enough strength to wipe them out. Here, have some water Andy. Jade, when we are gonna contact the American Army? You know, I feel much more secure if they fight with us. The Americans aren't as good as you think. They're all hippies and wimps and kids. (laughs) They can't fight, especially in a place like this. They're chicken shit. Hey, someone go help Rob and George. What happened, you guys all right? Looks like you ran into some trouble. Was it the enemy who did this to ya? I don't know, it could've been. Better let the doc take a look at 'em first. All right, you go see the doctor, then you can tell me what happened. Right. (girls giggling) [Amy] I'm gonna get you all wet if I let you get outta there. Don't! (laughing) [Amy] No way! No, I've got my clothes on, I'm not coming in! (Laughs) (ominous music) I have been watching you. You look absolutely stunning. Oh boy. What do you want? Just leave me alone! (man laughs) Leave me alone! Let go of me! Just leave me alone. Let go of me now! Help, help! Help me! (Yells) Help me! Get lost! Get outta my way. If a woman's not willing, then it's rape. I don't need this. (woman screams) (man groans) (gun fires) George, something's happening over there. I think maybe you better go and check it out. (guns fire) Go on, go! (guns fire) (men groan) Get down! (ominous music) They have advanced weapons, they can't be villagers. We have to be more careful. They could come back anytime they want. Commander, yeah, I think the new dance was a trap that was set for us. We should go check it out. What do you think commander? That's right Robert, I want you all to get check it out! (upbeat music) Look! There's that dance again. Look up. (men shout) Oh hey, how's it goin'! (women scream) (dramatic music) (gun fires) Yes, sir? You guys go circle around back, got it? (guns fire) (man groans) (gun fires) (man groans) (dramatic music) [Soldier] Freeze! (men groan) (men groaning) (man groans) All right, bring 'im back! C'mon! Let go of him! Stop dreamin'! You go tell the asshole Americans that nothing can stop us! Let me tell you something, asshole! The Americans are coming now, so listen. Surrender or you'll die! I dunno what you're talkin' about! (gun fires) (man groans) C'mon. Sergeant, this meeting was called because we've already identified the villagers. They are terrorists fighting against our government. We've been pointed to the location of one of their camps in the western region of the Forrest Mountain. Why not call an airstrike, sir? Good idea sergeant, but there's one small problem. What's that sir? They've taken Commander Yao's daughter as a hostage. Well, that does complicate things. We have to clean this one up on our own. I'm sending you in. Yes sir. I have a suggestion. Let's hear it. I request Squad Leader John Merlin, And Private First Class Bill West to join our mission. What the hell are you talkin' about, sergeant? Those guys are losers! They're not fit to fight. I know they failed the previous mission, but they're more familiar with the area! Hold it! They're damn good fighters, sir! I know they can do it! I'd like to give them one more chance. I hope this request will be approved, sir. Take them with you. But if they blow it, it's your ass! I understand sir. You must accomplish this mission, sergeant. Take any action you feel necessary. You have licencee to kill. Don't worry sir, I'll take 'em out! (dramatic music) (ominous music) (whistling) (man groans) Holy shit. I'll take care of things here. You check upstairs! You take care of that sucker, man. (dramatic music) All right? You all right? Sergeant, it's all over, I got him! And they say three is a crowd! (man groans) Well, well. [John] Ah, it's a fuckin' trick sarge! Merlin, you're timing's not bad, but you made a big mistake. [John] Hey come on, it was just a test! If that was for real, you'd be dead already. Bill, how'd you know he wasn't the guy we were lookin' for? I saw a dead soldier downstairs. According to our instructions, we only have to rescue him. It had to be a mistake. That's right, it's a battlefield! Don't trust anyone except your rifles. Kill or be killed is the name of the game. Major Max put me in charge of the next mission. I want both of you in because you're good fighters. Tomorrow, we'll be in the jungle. You better get ready for it. [Both] Yes sir! (bird chirps) (ominous music) - Hey boy! - Oh, Rosa! It sure is hot here. You must be tired, aren't you? [Soldier] Yeah, but that all changed when you showed up. [Rosa] Oh really? Would I ever lie? (Groans) (dramatic music) We better go this way. Okay. Oh shit! Fuck. (gun fires) - Hey, what's up? - What's going on? Oh my God, they've escaped! Oh no! They can't get too far. Let's go find 'em! (men shout) (ominous music) [Solider] You sure this is it? Yeah, according to my information. Okay boys, it's clear. Oh shit, we go back now sarge? Let's stick around first. Hey, don't move buddy. It's a mine! Fuck, we're in a bloody minefield! [Solider] Sarge, let's get the hell outta here! (guns fire) (man groans) (man groans) Sarge! (man yells) Come on! (gun fires) - Those fuckers! - Hold on sarge! Just hold on tight. I'm gonna get you outta here, okay? Just finish me, do it! I'm hurt bad, finish it! I'm your fuckin' sergeant, do it! I can't make it, go on! No, do it! (Groaning) (screaming) (gun fires) Is it all worth it? God only knows. I'm so damn tired of all this killin'. Poor sarge. Who next? This is fucked! I was born in the States, and I'm gonna die in this godforsaken land. Why? Why did we have to get caught up in this fucking mess? What are we gonna do? I don't wanna be a part of this anymore. What're you gonna do? He can't walk out like he doesn't exist. I need a long break away from this shit! So what do you think? You wanna go on doing this? I don't know! I'm so confused. Maybe, maybe I'll go with you. But I don't know what Max's gonna say about all this. (somber music) [Soldier] Don't move! - What're you doin' here? - Don't get me wrong. I'm a representative from Mr. Torosky. He sent me to seek your men to help him. That's all really, trust me. Can you take me to see him, please? All right, we'll go. Take him to the commander. (dramatic music) Eh? The woman's being kept inside. Hey, go bring her out now. Ah, Commander Halcom's here. Hey. How are ya? What's he doing here? He's here to pick up the woman to bring her to Torosky. Ah. All right then, you tell Torosky to take good care of this chick here. She's Commander Yao's daughter. Torosky becomes his son-in-law, he might just join our side. Whaddya think, huh? So make sure you keep his little lady alive. That shouldn't be a problem. You and Barry go with Jademan. Make sure you look after them. Thank you Commander Halcom. Just tell Torosky that I wanna see him. I'll pass the message on. I think I should be going. (romantic music) Well I hope Fatty's okay. Hey, that's George. George is coming, look! I was helping Dr. Chang here. Yeah. - She's injured. - Who is she? I met her in the forest. I think that she was running away. She came from the enemy's campsite and she was hurt, so I carried her back. Is that so? My name is Rose and I live with my family in the village. A year ago, the guerrillas came. They killed my parents and my brothers and forced us to become their slaves. Please help us. Did you see our man? They have a man in prison there. I think he must be your man, because he's the only stranger. We helped him out, but I lost him. I think she must be talkin' about Robert then. It's good to know that he's still alive. Okay Fatty, take her inside. If she's right, we should go look for him. You can stay here, I might need your help. I think she's all right. She's just tired. I'm gonna get her some medicine. In the meantime, you can look after her... Right, no problem! (ominous music) Merlin, where's your home? My home's Chicago. That's the greatest city, man. Nobody gives a fuck about anybody. How was your childhood? It was pretty rough, but then again, I was a tough kid in that neighborhood. How's that? The kids? I tell you, that grow up fast in that city. Money and broads, they come first. Had my first lay when I was 13. Well, actually I was raped. I didn't know what happened! Sounds fun. (Laughs) She was babysitting my younger sister for God's sake. 30 years old, the bitch. I was peepin' through the door of the room she was changing in, she caught me. She came rushing out and grabbed me and dragged me into my own room, crawled on top of me. I was scared shitless! I didn't know what was happening to me. (laughing) That's great. Yeah, well. I guess we better keep moving. (twig breaking) (dramatic music) Come on, you've had enough rest. We gotta keep moving. Lin, we'll split here, okay? What? Come on. You just leave me here, okay? Well fuck you man! What the hell are you talkin' about? I'm gonna go back to camp and tell Max that you deserted! What? Jesus, you wouldn't do that to me now? [Bill] Don't you bet on it! You're one hypocritical fuck! Whatever you think pal, I just don't give a shit! I just don't wanna be a deserter. You just go your own way! Fuck you! I should've left you in the jungle you motherfucker! Yeah right, just get away. Just get outta here! Have a good life. (dramatic music) Don't move. Try to calm down, man. Don't move, all right. Come on pal, leave me alone. You dumb fuck. You wanna be a dead hero? It's no use, it'll blow. Don't you fuckin' move! Now Bill, take your foot slowly out of your boot. - I can't. - Bill! Take your foot outta your boot. [Bill] I can't! (Bill screams) Now get a rock! Hurry up! (dramatic music) Move. - Easy. - Take it easy. Slowly. [Both] Don't move! All right, hands up! Get that ring off quickly. Move! (Bill groans) (groaning) (explosion booms) Hey Bill, you all right? [Soldier] You are coming with me, asshole! (upbeat music) [Man] Come on in, Annie. The water's lovely. (laughing) [Soldier] Freeze. (Anne yells) These are our hostage. How dare you break our rules, Annie. General Halcom, the American troops have been destroyed. (laughs) Right. Very pleased with your work. What can I do in return? General Halcom, Mr. Torosky wants some weapons promised. That's not a problem, huh? No right, you can take of it. Yes general, like I said, our generals always keep his promise. Good general, I'll send my men to pick up the weapons tomorrow. Okay general, I'll take care of it. (dramatic music) (motorcycle engines roar) (explosions boom) (guns fire) The helicopters with the attack. (explosions boom) Commander Yao, any new information? Major, there was a surprise attack on my troops, luckily your air force was there. Otherwise we'd have been wiped out for sure. They were equipped with Russian ammunition, but they didn't look like communists to me. So, have you identified the intruders? Yeah, terrorists. That's possible. My sources inform me that the terrorists have joined the communists in order to get the supply of ammunition. And, I'm gonna train up my platoon as soon as possible and stop the communists from infiltrating this area. We learned some hard lessons in our last mission. We underestimated the communists. We both have to be very careful this time. Yeah, I'll be more careful this time major. I'll try to find out more about the terrorists. Good. (suspenseful music) Hey! (Groans) Who are you, where are you takin' me to? Oh, I came to rescue you. You can relax. I'm a South Viet guerrilla. Our campsite's on the other side of the mountain. There's nothing to worry about. Come on, you're in good hands. - Oh really? - Yeah. - Ow. - Huh? What happened to you. Torosky's man attacked me, he's a traitor! Huh? (dramatic music) This way, c'mon. (ominous music) Andy, I was just looking you for. That Torosky's man, Jademan is a traitor! He took Annie away. That asshole, I knew he was trouble when I first saw him. And that Annie needs to learn a lesson. Now don't do anything stupid. Just kill Jademan and bring her back. The father works for Halcom. Hal, you know what to do. Sure, that bastard's gonna bite the dust. Why are you staring at me? Oh. Our campsite's just behind the forest. Oh God. (screaming) Let me go! Stop it, no! Let me go! (Yells) No, help! (man groans) - Get back here! - No! (yelling) No! No! Help! (gasping) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (man groans) (dramatic music) (guns fire) This is very good, very good. Let's move. (guns fire) (man screams) (gun fires) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) (panting) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (man groans) (gun fires) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) - You go that way! - All right. (groaning) Drop that mother fucker, or I'll blow your fucking head off! (groaning) C'mon, quick. Hey. Good. (laughing) Dr. Chang you know where George is, right? Why don't you go and tell him to wait for us? Right, okay. I'll take care of it. Chang is so thick, he'll probably lose his way. [Woman] Yeah, right. Let's get some water. - Hello! - Oh, hi guys. You must be the commander of this jubilant troop, is that right? Yeah, I'm Commander Yao. Oh, we are the Republic Force Platoon Number 27. I'm Captain Foster here to help your division. Please explain our mission. I haven't had any news about your force comin'. We're following Major Max's orders. What a great arrangement he made. So now we'll all be workin' together, please explain our mission to us. [Commander Yao] Well who will be in charge here now? You, of course. I think we all agree that you should be in charge! C'mon Dad, don't be stubborn. We should cooperate with their force, Dad. It's much better to fight the war together. All right, I'll be the commander in charge here. C'mon. C'mon. There's only one path through here. George must be up there somewhere. Come on, let's take a look. Oh, hi George! So tell me George, did you find anything? I dunno, their site used to be here, but it's not here now. They must've found out we were coming, so they relocated to a safer place, I guess. All right, we'll report this to Commander Yao and let him decide if we should keep going or not. (dramatic music) (guns fire) (man groans) Hey? Now talk, where'd they go? Oh God, I'm hurt. Tell me what happened to the camp, huh? You fools, we surrounded your camp. You're finished. George, you can let him go. All right listen, if he was telling the truth, then we're all in big trouble. I'll inform the commander. Right. - Here. - Oh, sure. Hey c'mon, let me have a gun too. (dramatic music) (guns fire) (screaming) Get ready people, our enemies are all over us. - Okay! - All right men, spread out! Go on! Right! (guns fire) (screaming) (explosion booms) (screaming) (guns fire) C'mon, c'mon try to stay behind me, Dad! I'm doin' all right! (explosion booms) (men screaming) (dramatic music) Get down! (guns fire) (men screaming) They're very tricky. Let's go find 'em, men. Okay. (gun fires) (man screams) (gun fires) (man groans) (man screams) (gun fires) (man screaming) (screaming) (guns fire) (birds chirping) It doesn't hurt! American friend, don't let me down. I got a lock on you. This fight will cost you a fortune. (Laughs) (dramatic music) (grunting) (laughing) [Soldier] Whoa! Bastard. Get up, get up! [Soldier] Go on kill 'im, kill 'im! Get up, I'm gonna rip your eyes then we're gonna fuck you. [Solider] No good, kill 'im. Rip his eyes out. Go on. Go on, kill him, kill him! (grunting) (gun cocks) Oh ow, no. No! Get up! Come on, get up! Ow, my head. Well American, you got what you want. So, I'm not going to execute you till tomorrow. It is my very, very, very special gift for you, my friend. [John] You can kiss my ass you motherfucka! Get him outta here! (dramatic music) (grunting) Ha! (groaning) (dramatic music) Huh? (groaning) (dramatic music) (guns fire) Watch out! (woman screams) (men groan) How is she? Go find Robert, I'll look after her. Could you give me a last kiss? (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (man groans) (gun fires) (man groans) (water splashes) (gun fires) (man groans) (gun fires) (gun fires) (man groans) (gun fires) (man groans) Hey, tell me where the hostage is. (man groans) George, it's you. It's good to see that you're safe Robert. The commander's in danger. And we're not out of danger ourselves. C'mon, let's go. But wait, my father's still in the cave. We can't go back now. (explosion booms) (gasping) Pa, pa, pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Come on, Annie. Pa! Pa! (Sobbing) Pa! Hey Dad, look over there. There's George and Robert. It's all right, I can manage. It's good to see our units are back together. The road'll be hard from here on commander, because our route's been blocked by that giant explosion. Then we can't reach the frontier on time. Annie's father was killed by it. I think it was deliberate, keep us from moving forward. Than the American's our last hope. Let me go! Let me go! Let me go. Let me go! (groaning) Where the hell you'd take the weapons to? I don't know. (Groaning) Did you hear what I asked you, asshole? No. (Groans) So you think you're tough. Just tell me where, sucker. [Soldier] Fuck off! (dramatic music) (man groans) That's enough. I'll make him talk. All right asshole, tell me where they are, or I'm gonna stick this right through your balls. (man groans) Now you see, answer us, or I swear to God I will skin you alive. Okay, the site is at the old forest, about 10 miles from here. Take care of him. Gimmie that. No, no. (gun fires) (man groans) (plane engine roars) (gun fires) (man groans) Go ahead, fire. C'mon. C'mon! (screaming) I'll get it! Go! C'mon! (explosion booms) (man groans) Come in, this is 27 West. We're inside the enemy camp. The operation is a go! Things are moving along, over! - C'mon! - Quick! (gun fires) (man groans) (plane engine roars) (suspenseful music) (men groan) (dramatic music) (bushes rustling) You're a fuckin' nut, man. Let's get outta here. (man groans) C'mon. [Pilot] Major Max, this is Silver Eagle. There's a frontier under control. Repeat, we have the frontier under control. The enemy is reporting for the east, over. (explosion booms) Shit man, you know better than that. Come on! (gun fires) (man groans) (guns fire) (men groan) Hey, what're you doin'? (gun fires) (man groans) Oh no. (gun fires) (man groans) (man yells) Ya! Hey, wait you guys! Hey, wait for me! - Hey come on! - Come on. Come on, man! (gun fires) (man groans) (explosion booms) (explosions boom) (guns fire) (man groans) (man groans) (gun fires) (men groan) (dramatic music) You shouldn't have come for me, you dumb shit. - I mean I what's... - C'mon. Even the score. Hey! (gun fires) (Bill groans) (gun fires) (man groans) Bill? Bill! (John yells) [Pilot] Special troops rushing to help outside. They're coming from the northeast, be careful, over. (guns fire) (motorcycle engines revving) (gun fires) (men groan) (gun fires) (man groans) (gun fires) (men groan) (dramatic music) (explosion booms) (laughing) No, you don't. He's mine. Well American, look around. No where to escape. (men laughing) (dramatic music) (explosions booming) [Soldier] Let's go! Move there, c'mon! (dramatic music) - Ah that's it. - Is it the beginning of the end of your life. Drop your weapons, you're surrounded! Eh? (guns fire) (man groans) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (man groans) You motherfucker! (grunting) (gun fires) (man groans) (explosion booms) (triumphant music)
