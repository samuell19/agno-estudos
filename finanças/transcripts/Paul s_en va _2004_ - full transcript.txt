PAUL IS LEAVING A THEATRICAL GAME PROPOSED TO 17 YOUNG ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AT THE DRAMATIC ARTS CONSERVATORY OF GEVEVA PRODUCED AND DIRECTED BY ALAIN TANNER PROLOGUE MONDAY, MAY 5 BETWEEN 5 AND 10 A.M. You really want me to go? You hate me that much? Don't be ridiculous. Things are great between us. But I don't want you to sleep here. Why? Because I don't want to wake up beside you. Why? It would be like we were in love, and we're not. I like you. I like having sex with you... You like that with everyone. That's not true. I have someone in my life, but he's never here. I could wake up next to him, not with anyone else. -But you can sleep with other people. -Yeah, I like that. So you're kicking me out? -Where am I gonna go? -I don't know. Wherever you want. You know I'm homeless. So you're used to it. That's real nice. You'll find someplace. And don't forget to take your condom. Here's a Kleenex. The garbage can is behind the door. How romantic. You could take the garbage down. Then I won't have to get up early. Here we go. Ew. Gross. Bingo. Gross. Shit! Hey! Let's go. Is everyone here? Let's do the salon scene. Trissotin, Armand, Henriette, Belize, and Philamatte, places, please. Everyone else, be quiet. Thank you. "Will she, nill she, quick, "Out she goes! From your apartment richly lined, "Where that ingrate's outrageous mind "At your fair life her javelin throws." "Ah! gently. Allow me to breathe, I beseech you." Marion, please. You're doing too much. You're saying to Trissotin, "Stop, I can't bear it," but no need to swoon. -More concrete. -Yes. Let's go from there. "Ah! gently. Allow me to breathe, I beseech you." "Give us time to admire, I beg." "One feels, at hearing these verses, an indescribable something "that goes through one's inmost soul and makes one feel quite faint." CHAPTER 1 THE DISAPPEARANCE TUESDAY, MAY 6 MARTIN HEIDEGGER "The widely and rapidly spreading "devastation of language "not only undermines " aesthetic and moral responsibility "in every use of language. "It is rooted "in the destruction of the human being." -You're leaving? -Yeah. I don't feel like listening to Mr. Paul B. I don't care for his grand theories. I want to be an actress, not a sociologist or an anthropologist or any other kind of -ologist. If you enjoy this stuff, stay. -You'll get in trouble. -I don't care. Do you like this stuff? Not really. I don't really get it. But he's nice. And it can be good to get out of the theater sometimes. No. You should never leave. You have to live with the texts, breathe them constantly. Acting isn't an occupation. It's a vocation. It's absolute. You want to die on the stage, don't you? The saint and martyr of the stage. You're screwed. What's he doing? Did you see? Margot's not here, either. That's odd. What's that got to do with it? Paul's obviously a lady's man. What time is it? What time is it? 10:15 a.m. The teacher's late. He's usually on time. Sorry, I'm late. Hey, Momo, did you bring Paul B.? -Why, is he not here? -Not yet. What are you always carrying around in that bag? My treasure, or my house, depends on the day. Did you notice? Paul and Margot are both missing. I always thought Margot had a thing for Paul B. Maybe they're on a lover's cruise. Oh, shut up. I know he has seduced all of you, and Margot had the winning number. Yeah, right. Two hours of break. He's not coming. You like that, huh? Oh, yes. He bores me stiff. He's probably sick. Did he call the administration? No news from them. They called his house. No answer. Isn't that odd? Yeah. Maybe Margot can explain. Again with that? You're idiots! Should we sit there? Don't you think he's been acting strange recently? I didn't notice. Strange how? I don't know. Weird. Less close to us. He was always a bit distant. He's not from the same family. What family? Oh, right, "the big family of actors." Sounds like you know more about him that we do. Did you see him outside of class? It happened. "It happened"? What's that supposed to me? What's "it"? Is '"it" private lessons? -Ah... -Come on, tell me. I have no comment. So you're hiding something. If you saw him outside of class, it wasn't to decode -the signs of the contemporary world. -No. -It's my business. -You could have told me. We don't have to tell each other everything. Some things you keep to yourself. I knew Paul was a skirt-chaser. So, Margot took up the baton? No. Leave Margot alone. You're going to regret it. Regret it? You three, you militants, you're his groupies. You should know where he is. We went by his house. Nobody answered. His voicemail has been shut off. We have no idea. Hello, ma'am. I'm calling from Maison Soleil Beauty Products. Did you get our catalog? Did anything catch your eye? You don't have skin problems? Everyone does. He just wants some peace and quiet. We went to see him a few days ago. We had an argument. But that's not why he's gone. I'm not so sure. You argued? Hello, sir. Is your wife home? I'm calling from Maison Soleil Beauty Products. She's not home? We have products for men, too. There's no reason why men should neglect their skin. Pardon me? You want to know whether the skin on my butt is too fat or too dry? He hung up. I didn't even have time to check. Butt-skin or not, we did have an argument. About what? He doesn't believe in activism anymore. And you do? We want to fight. Don't you? Depends on what it's about. Not necessarily in the streets. What's the use of getting beat up by riot police? I learned lots of stuff. It was good for me. Well, he figured that out 30 years ago, so of course he's done. It's not normal. Hello, ma'am. Maison Soleil Beauty Products. Did you get our catalog? Oh, you have perfect skin? Shall I call back in 50 years? How old are you? Ah, twenty years old, I see. Well, 50 years is a long time. That'll be around 2050. Unfortunately, that'll be the year of the great panic. The great panic? You really want to know? Well, with the greenhouse gases, all the mafias, the polar ice caps will have melted... We'll have water up to our knees. Panic. Our current lifestyle is doomed. By the time we realize that, it'll be too late. You didn't know? It'll be too late. The world will be chaos. I'm scaring you? No, the scary times are 2030. That's not the panic. The scare of 2030? That's when capitalism breaks down. No big deal. The panic? That's when everyone is trying to flee. Your neighbor is getting the hell out, so you do, too, because you assume your neighbor knows something. You don't get it? That's OK. I'll call back in 2050. Bye now. Paul told you that? No, that's the Maison Soleil. He told us we didn't understand, that violence doesn't work anymore. He has lost his illusions. He's kind of bitter and cynical now. Not cynical... He got upset when we said his generation screwed things up. He said there's no utopias anymore and that the world will collapse without us having to help it along. He calls it "the slow-motion apocalypse." -So he thinks it's funny. -No, it's not funny. Hello, ma'am. Maison Soleil Beauty Products. Excuse me. Goodbye. Shit! I'm sick of this. So he doesn't have any ideas anymore? No, he does. That instead of destroying, we should create something beautiful. Why not? With his past, we were hoping for something else. -Like blowing up the system. -And he's talking about beauty. There was a misunderstanding. He thinks his points of reference aren't useful to us, that he can't help us anymore. It's up to us now. Hello, ma'am. Maison Soleil Beauty Products. It was a nice summer Sunday. I was walking in the countryside with my son, who was eight then. He was picking dandelions by the road, making a bouquet for his mom. I pointed out that the sky was completely blue, not one cloud. He looked up, pointed at the peaks of the Jura mountains, and said, "No, look, there's a cloud there." He was right. And he said, "The Good Lord is sitting on it." "The Good Lord?" I said. "Yes," he said back. "He made everything: "the mountains, the animals, the flowers." I didn't want to contradict him. I thought about what I might tell him in a few years. First, this: that the simple act of saying "believe in God" is irrefutable proof that He doesn't exist, because if He did, there'd be no need to believe in Him. He would simply exist, like the little cloud in the sky. If you have to believe He exists, that means you can just as well not believe it, that there is doubt, and in the case of doubt, err on the side of caution. God is therefore merely an idea adopted by humans to ward off their fear of the unknown and of death. And as the centuries passed, we started to realize that it wasn't such a great idea. We kept walking, and my son went on gathering dandelions. I remembered a Jacques Prévert line that goes, "What could God have been up to before Creation?" In the sky, the little cloud had frayed apart, and then it disappeared completely. -How's the pizza business? -Fine, fine. I don't know how people eat that stuff, but they do. Maybe you should open your own business. We would make a good team. With you in the kitchen... We'd get married. Sounds great! You only got five bucks of gas? That won't get you very far. Yeah, could you help me out? Sure. Take 12 bucks more. I'll reset the counter on the pump. With any luck, the next customer will cover your little gift. -When do you get off? -Ten o'clock. -I'll pick you up. -To go where? Have pizza? No. Since we're going to work together, we could cut to the chase. Not the wedding: the wedding night. Oh, really? I'm too tired. I'm going to go to bed. All alone? All alone. I don't think people have enough sex in life. Margot! Margot! Someone's calling you. Stop! It's Momo. This is ridiculous. It's 11:00 p.m. Jesus Christ! If he does this every night... We have better things to do. THURSDAY, MAY 15 PIER PAOLO PASOLINI "The world is not only dominated by the masters. "It is also dominated by the intellectuals. "The cultural mastery of the world brings happiness. "Don't let yourself be tempted by the champions of misfortune, "of stupid hostility, of seriousness joined with ignorance." "Be happy!" "Gentrification is an integral part of the class struggle. "That is why I have cited and continue to cite "Marx's expression: genocide, cultural genocide." -Is it good? -Needs salt. -It has no flavor. -Nothing has any flavor. "The dominant class, whose new mode of production "has created a new form of power, "and, as a result, a new form of culture, "has carried out in recent years a genocide "of Italy's distinctive working-class cultures. "It is the greatest cultural genocide in Italian history." -May as well eat at McDonald's. -No, that's gross. These are fresh carrots at least. And the chicken's not so bad. It has flavor. It's a fake flavor. Tastes like a factory. These chickens are raised in cages by the million. And they're blind. They poke their eyes out? No, it's because they live their whole lives in the dark. "The young Roman underclasses have lost their culture, "that is, their way of being, of behaving, "of speaking, of assessing reality. "They have been given a model of a consumerist, bourgeois life. "They have been destroyed and gentrified in the classic sense." Will you stop reading us that stuff? We're here to eat. -What is it? -It's Pasolini. -What's it about? -Cultural genocide. What's that got to do with hormone-raised chickens? Where'd you get it? Mr. Paul B. gave it to me. I knew it. The guru strikes again. He's not coming. Hi, everyone! Margot! Where have you been? Did you have a nice trip with Mr. Paul B.? What are you talking about? You left without a word, so we started to wonder. -Do I owe you an explanation? -Paul B. has gone missing. Missing? So? I was in Ticino. You just go off on vacation like that, whenever you want? No, I wasn't on vacation. Paul asked me to go film an interview with an old guy who fought in the Spanish Civil War with the International Brigades. He was so interesting. He was 16 when he went to Spain to fight fascism. Sixteen years old, can you imagine? I hitchhiked back last night, all the way from Ticino. It's like the other end of the world. So Paul disappeared? -Disappeared how? -Off the face of the Earth. So you weren't with me. Obviously. I gotta run. I have to go to the vet. "When was life every truly ours? "When are we ever what we truly are? "We are ill-reputed, nothing more than vertigo and emptiness, "a frown in the mirror, horror and vomit. "Life is never ours. It always belongs to the others. "Life is no one's. We are all life. "Bread of the sun for the others, the others that we all are." "When I am, I am another. "My acts are more mine when they are the acts of others. "In order to be, I must be another, leave myself, "search for myself in the others, "the others that don't exist if I don't exist, "the others that give me total existence. "There is no me. We are always us. "Life is other, always there, further off, "beyond you and beyond me, always on the horizon. "Life which leads us astray and makes us strangers, "that invents our face "and wears it away, hunger for being, O death, our bread." No news, no messages. No one's answering at his house. It's becoming worrisome. It's been two weeks. This is weird. Well, it's 10:20 a.m. He's not coming. See you, crew! Something happened to him. I bet he jumped in the Rhone, where he liked to go for walks. He's not suicidal! Lots of people go missing, thousands every year. Most of them are teenagers who run away from home and come back three days later. We have to do something. We can't just wait around like this. Let's go to his place, open his door with a locksmith, go to the cops, go check the hospitals. Maybe his past caught up with him. Some other old leftists came after him. Yeah, right. That's all ancient history. History is never ancient. It's never over. Maxime, can you bring me the blackboard, please? Recall Marx's observation, dear students. Karl Marx, in his "18th Brumaire." All great events and characters from world history appear twice. First as tragedy, then as farce. He uses the example of Napoleon Bonaparte and Napoleon III. But think about today. Bush the Father and the Bush the Son, it's the same carnage. Not quite. George H. W. Bush, the Gulf War, that's the tragedy. W., the son, with his liar's poker face, that's the farce. It's the same thing repeated, but worse or with less credibility. Zero credibility! It's the conception of history as a spiral. If you look at the spiral from above, it's a circle. Things repeat in the same spot. Looks like an apple. If you take a cross-section, you can see that the two events are superimposed, but differently. They're not in the same spot on the spiral. I rest my case. WEDNESDAY, MAY 21 PIERRE GUYOTAT "The last man in human history will be a slave. "There is no arms race. "There is only a race toward slavery, "for whom politicians will be the last master. "I am not interested in sex. I am a politician. "I am hunting down the perfect slave. "The last man, the last slave, "will die with my insane language in his throat. "In my view, prostitution, free or not, consenting or not, "has always been and still remains slavery. "My insanity "is this attempt to develop a language, a music, "that the last man, this last slave, "will be able to use to say to his master, his politician, "that his master has the means to take ownership "of his body and of his voice, "but that he does not have the means to take ownership of his thoughts. "Thought "cannot be bought or sold. "No master can own "both the sexual organs and its thoughts." -Do you come here often? -Every day. Every day? I come to see if Paul B.'s body is floating in the Rhone. You're crazy. I don't see anything. THURSDAY, MAY 22 PIERRE MICHON "I have rarely prayed. "In early September 2001, "my mother, who, as an adult, "had attempted to be both my father and mother, "and who, in her advanced years, could have been my daughter... "My mother was dying in the hospital in the small town of G. "There were huge trees by her window, a wall of leaves. "Every day of that late summer was beautiful. "The sun shone a thousand different ways on that green wall "under the eyes of a dying woman who had loved trees. "I saw her every day, "but when September 7th came, "I saw that the time had come. "My mind saw it, "but my heart couldn't follow. "She was gasping. She couldn't speak. "She had entered that phase of the wandering soul "that the Tibetans call the Bardo. "I sat beside her and, "after a moment whose duration I cannot define, "hours or minutes, "I stood up quickly, went out and ran into a bookstore "to buy some books." "When I went back into my mother's room, she wasn't gasping anymore. "She wasn't breathing anymore. "I held her hand. It was still quite warm. "The nurse having declared her dead, I was left alone. "Only my mind was there, and I observed, like before. "The books were sitting patiently at the foot of the bed "in their little envelope, "near the feet of the body that are so small. "The green wall was good for the mind. "The mind was warm, too, as it always is. "I should pray, call to the heart and the soul, which she deserved. "I tried one of the things I had learned in Sunday school, "probably the Lord's Prayer. "I very quickly stopped. "And then the text, "the prayer, asserted itself. It came from far away, "as though sent by another, "and I spoke it aloud, so that, in some way, the dead woman would hear: "'Brothers, men who live after us, "'Harden not your hearts against us, "'For if you take pity on us poor men, "'God will have more mercy toward you.' "My heart and soul came running. "I recited the poem from beginning to end as it should be: "in tears. "I stood before my mother's body "as one should: "in tears." "I prayed one other time, "in October, a few years earlier. "A child was born at night. "I had just returned home near dawn. "Something came to me, the desire to pray, "to open myself. "Sitting on my bed, calm, "smiling, if one smiles when one is alone, "I recited aloud, from beginning to end, "Boaz Asleep. "I recited it as should be: "calmly, accepting of everything, "hoping against all reason, the glory that always comes." How's it coming? Why'd you ask me to come? This is Paul's house. I have the keys to his place. You have his keys? Why? -That doesn't concern you. -I see. If I'd guessed... We have to figure out what's going on. I'm scared to go alone. What if he's dead in there? -We should call the cops. -I don't want them involved. I can't stand not knowing. Maybe we'll find something: a letter, a clue, something. You're good with computers. He has one. OK, let's go. Have you found anything? A letter, anything? I don't see anything. There's no dead body. That's something. Here's the computer. I don't know anything about them. You just open it. But it's not very legit... There might be confidential stuff. Given the situation, it's worth a shot. Look. There's an autobiography. Looks like he was involved in the revolutionary groups. Anything more recent? Yeah, hang on. There's a file called "Project 17." 17... There are 17 of us in his class. Maybe it's about us. Yeah, look. There are 17 icons, each one with our names. That's funny. Is there anything about his disappearance? Hang on. I don't see anything. But there's a document which is an introduction. Look. Read that. "Who, in light of the current intellectual suffocation, "does not feel the senseless but visceral, necessary desire "to, through the power of one's mind, "leave this world completely defined by money, "a world that risks drifting toward barbarity?" That sounds like him. Quiet! Quiet! Listen up, everyone. I have a lot to say. Can we turn the music down? Michel? Michel and I went to Paul's apartment. -His place? Did you see him? -He wasn't there. He wasn't dead, either. Michel looked on his computer and found messages for each of us. -Messages? -Yeah. In addition to some quotes, he gave each of us a mission to carry out now that he's gone, as a goodbye. But where is he? You don't know? No. No idea. We printed the missions out. We'll read that to you. There are really all different types. Mathias, you're going swan hunting in a mall, and you'll say: "Hey, swans are an endangered species. "Go duck-hunting instead." Even after he's gone, he's still a pain in the ass. I want to be an actor, not a swan hunter. I'll take it. I want to do the swan hunting. This one's for Marina. It's pretty mysterious, but it means he knew a lot about us. Especially the ladies... What is it? It must be related to your environmental focus. It's simple: "Marry your river." Does that mean anything to you? I think so. Smells like mystery to me. Probably. Theater is Marina's calling. But marrying a river... -For Marie, it's Pasolini. -No marriage there. He mentioned a book for you, but we didn't find it. I already have it. He gave it to me a few weeks ago. This one's funny. It's for the shock troops: Mirabelle, Madeleine, and Monica. You're supposed to write a little play, around ten minutes long, so it's not too much, based on a quote from the British newspaper The Guardian. He suggests checking out Alfred Jarry. -That's weird. -What's the quote? Here we go: "American has an umbrella the size of Manhattan up its ass." That's a tough one. I'm going out. It's bad luck to open an umbrella indoors. You could do a five-act tragedy on that. OK, next. For Mouche, he wants you to think about what is truly pornographic these days. Now there's something interesting. I'll do the photos. -As a model? -No, as photographer. Thank God. I was afraid for a sec. You can just read the TV guide. Momo, this one's for you. He wants you to draw up a list of useless objects that our lives are full of. He's got the wrong man. Why would he ask me that? I don't have a pot to piss in. The last time I had an apartment, the court bailiff said I was "unseizable." Actually, Momo, there's a new law that says garbage bags are seizable property. Margot, if you're telling the truth, then your mission is complete. The truth about what? Your interview with the guy who fought in the Spanish Civil War. -Mission accomplished! -Now, on to Marion. Think about and write a short text on the following quote from a contemporary author: "One man who prays alone, that's his business. "Two men who pray together, that's when things get dangerous." What? Can you repeat that? Look around. A guy who prays alone never makes war. Two, that makes them want to. That's why there aren't any more wars of religion. OK, yeah... For Matteo, it says: "Is it still possible today to be a resistance fighter, "like, for example, during the German occupation of France? "Can we still imagine a resistance fighter "in the age of surveillance?" Make a list of the tools used to surveil society. -Sure: cell phones. -Credit cards. All kinds of cards. I don't have any. All the video cameras on the streets, in stores, and banks, all over. -The Internet. -Et cetera, et cetera. Resist! One last one, for Marco. Uh-oh. I'm scared. You should be. You're supposed to draw up a list of what's intolerable: intolerable in the strong sense or the little everyday stuff. You did a good job handing out gifts to everyone. Some were more curses than blessings, but... We don't have to accept them, since the gift-giver isn't here. You didn't tell us what you got. This. The Man Without Qualities, by Robert Musil. "Read and reflect." He'd already given it to me a while back. Sounds like you two were close. For a while, yeah. -Close, close? -Yeah. I feel like that book helped me understand why he left. And why is that? It's the end of a world he once belonged to, with all its values and requirements, its sense of proportions, its revolutionary aspirations... And a new world comes along that he doesn't want to belong to, a world that surely has its own dreams and beauty, but he doesn't understand them and doesn't want to. FRIDAY, MAY 23 CARLOS DRUMMOND DE ANDRADE "For the time being, we won't sing of love, "which sought refuge beyond the underground passageways. "We'll sing of fear, which paralyzes embraces. "We won't sing of hate, because it doesn't exist. "There is only fear, our father and companion, "the great fear of prairies, "seas, and deserts, the fear of soldiers, "of mothers, of churches. "We will sing of the fear of dictators and of democrats. "We will sing of the fear of death and the fear of the afterlife. "And then we will die of fear, "and up from our graves will sprout fearful yellow flowers." SATURDAY, MAY 24 FYODOR DOSTOEVSKY "Thought is nearly impossible in this day and age. "It comes at a high price. "It is true that one can buy ready-made ideas. "They're for sale everywhere, sometimes even for free. "But that which is free always proves expensive. "We're already starting to notice. "What's the result? "No advantage and persistent unrest." Look at our cart! We have too much! How much money do you have? Twenty bucks. What about you? Same. Do you have a credit card? No, do you? -Yeah, but I already hit my limit. -Look at us... Plus, we wanted to go to the movies after. OK, back to square one: First, we get rid of everything we don't really want. Two, everything we don't have to have. Three, everything that isn't truly necessary. 1.60 francs, please. 1.60 francs. That's 80 cents each. One big one is cheaper than two small ones. Hey, what are you doing here? I'm on my mission. Remember? I'm swan hunting. How many have you bagged? They're everywhere here. It's hunter heaven. Heaven or hell. Want to grab a bite to eat? I'm starving. -No, we're going to the movies. -What are you going to see? We don't know yet. Thirteen movies are showing. We'll find one. OK. Peace! Everybody looks terrible. It's making me depressed. Life makes you not like people these days. It's because they don't like themselves. On the other hand... Remember when Breton meets Nadja? "She carried her head high, unlike everyone else on the sidewalk. "She looked so delicate that she scarcely seemed to touch the ground. "What was so extraordinary about what was happening in those eyes? "What was it they reflected? Some obscure suffering "and, at the same time, some luminous pride?" I don't feel like it. But look. There are lots of movies. That's the problem. They all seem the same. Maybe you're right. I don't feel like it either. Are you hungry? There's nothing but sweets. I don't like that. You never want anything! Popcorn isn't sweet. Come on! No way am I letting you eat popcorn. Let's go! We have to pay. I thought it was free for the first hour. Shit, we just barely went over. It's more than the tub of yogurt. We have bad luck today. We screwed everything up. What a disaster. Thanks. We can cut. Thanks. Take ten. Thanks. -How's your mission going? -What mission? The ones Paul gave us. I'm done. What about you, Mouche? I haven't had a chance to think about it. What about you, Momo? Me neither. I have to find an apartment. Isn't that more important? What about you? It's none of your business! Yes, it is! You don't get it. There's something bigger going on. Like what? What a joke. That's what we're supposed to figure out, all together. We could make a video. You just want to play with a camera. A project... There was never any project! I have enough work, plus I have to deliver pizzas at night... It was just his way of saying goodbye, that's it, Margot. We can make of it what we want. Throw it out! There was never any project. I'm sure you're wrong. You're all chickening out. Not us. Ain't that right, Monica? Yeah, we wrote the play. About the umbrella? Yeah. You'll see, it's amazing. -Is it funny at least? -Super funny. See? They did their job. Yeah, but Paul was their guru. Ah, the revolution! Or what's left of it. He and his friends ruined it all with their big ideals. We're fed up. You all seem to have forgotten that someone has disappeared. That's serious. You keep talking, but I've been going to the police stations, to the hospitals. -And? -Nothing. Nothing. MONDAY, MAY 26 AIMÉ CÉSAIRE "At the end of daybreak, the disparate stranding, "the exacerbated stench of corruption, "the monstrous sodomies of the host and the sacrificing priest, "the impassible beakhead frames of prejudice and stupidity, "the prostitutions, the hypocrisies, the lechery, the treasons, "the lies, the frauds, the corruption, "the panting of a deficient cowardice, "the exasperating enthusiasm of additional chicks, "the greeds, the hysterias, the perversions, "the harlequins of misery, the cripplings, the itchings, "the hives, the tepid hammocks of degeneracy." "The teratic bulb of the night, "sprouted from our vileness and our renunciations." -Are you closing? -In five minutes. How much do you need? 500 bucks. Is that possible? Yeah, but it has to be worth it, or I'm screwed. OK. We'll come in through the back. I'll give you the key. Lock the door behind you. And don't forget to break the window, or they'll suspect me. You're a doll. Thank the lords of oil instead. Hey, Melanie! Momo, what are you doing here? I'm squatting. What are you carrying around? I'm making a list of useless objects, and I'm gathering them, too. Gathering or stealing? That's for me to know. Want to grab a drink? On me. WEDNESDAY, MAY 28 LOUIS-FERDINAND CÉLINE "That's exile, a foreign country, "the inexorable perception of reality "as it really is "during those long, lucid hours, "rare in the flux of human time, "when the ways of the old country "abandon you but the new ways "haven't sufficiently stupefied you yet." You've got a nice place here. You can stay a few nights. It'll be a nice change from couch surfing wherever you've been. But what if Paul comes back and finds me here? I don't think he's coming back yet. But if he did, I'm sure he'd understand. Come on, I'll make you a coffee. There's a big bed back there. Big enough for two. CHAPTER 3 THE WORLD "Ours is a life of puppets, "and those who control us "and hold the strings of the dirty puppet theater "are banking, "above all else, "on the inveterate self-regard of each and every one of us, "which makes it so that under no circumstances "would anyone wish to believe himself unfree "and to admit, and honestly and sincerely recognize, "that he is not free." So, friends, like Paul asked us, we've prepared a little theatrical game for you. It's a little one-act play. What was the quote he gave you again? "America has an umbrella the size of Manhattan up its ass." Depending on who plays America, I'd love to be the umbrella. In fact, Mathias, we have just the role for you. Oh, yeah? I hope it's the umbrella. Nope. George W. Bush. Oh, great, here comes the politics lesson. Everybody, turn to the left! No, no. This is just for fun. It's a take-off on Ubu Roi by Alfred Jarry. And Ubu, of course, is Bush. Of course. They are pretty alike. Margot, you can do the set design, if you want. Why not? Dubya! Dubya, wake up, Dubya! Goddamn! By my green candle, how dare you wake us? We were just having a nice dream, like an angel, shit! God was talking to me, straight through the Internet. I'm sorry, but people are here who want to see you. They've already been waiting for a while now. Who are these people who come and disturb our sleep? They're some weirdos. They don't look like people from here. They said they've come a long way to see you. From what I can understand, they're from the deserts of Barbary. Perhaps they have come bearing gifts, like the magi? Some nice Cubans and coke? -How many of them are there? -Two. Buggery pshite, Mama! There were three magi. You should read the Good Book again, Goddammit! Did they... Did they give you their names? Did they give you their names? I think... You think...? What are you waiting for? I'm waiting! My ears are wide open! -My ears. -My ears. Hang on. One of them was named... Sdam, King of Babylonia and a great oil merchant. He has a big black mustache. The other was named, if I'm not mistaken, Yussama. He says he's prince of the pump of finance of the Arabian deserts. He has a long, thin, gray beard, and a towel on his head. Buggery pshite, Mama! That's them all right! They're here, in our white house? Oh boy. You shouldn't have kept them waiting. They're friends of mine. Well, kind of. -Did they say what they want? -No. Idiot! You should have asked them. You know I can't talk and think at the same time. What do I do? I don't know. Should I show them in? Of course! Shit! But these Barbarians scare me. Bring my faithful friends, Uncle Berlu and Blair-Blair. You never know with these two. My Lordships! What brings you to my white house? We finally meet. We know all about you, and at last we meet. Introductions are called for! You, you're Sdam! You look just like him! And you must be Yussama! You're famous the world over, now that you blew up my biggest castles with your flying muskets. What a pleasure to have you here! Allow me to introduce my faithful servants: Blair-Blair, King of Great Brootan. Your faithful servant. And Uncle Berlu, from Ritaly! The honor is all yours. Well, my Lordships, what brings you to my white house? What brings you to my kingdom? What brings you to my kingdom? We have a request to make of you. Yes, a favor to ask of you. You? But you are exiles, terrorist from the Axis of Evil. And you come to ask a favor of the Emperor of Good? I wonder how you even made it this far. And where are my guards? They were napping. I'll have them whipped! In any case, you would have left us alive, because you need us. How's that? Explain yourself. You need us, for how could you be the Emperor of Good without Evil? Good exists only because evil exists. So you need us. And you know it. You've used us quite a bit already. I don't understand a word of the philosophical gobbledygook, all right? You got what you wanted. Thanks to us, you're swimming in oil. The route through the Muslim lands, through Asia and the Caucasus, has been opened to you. And when you die, you will have earned a seat beside the god of the infidels. That's what you wanted. By my green candle! Now you will pay your debt to us. -A debt? -Yes, a debt. The time has come to repay the favor. What's this? You want to go to Paradise! What we want is to live like you. -Like me? -Yes, like you. In your big kingdom, in the light. What? In Amoorica? Are you kidding? I'm gonna go nucular! You're crazy. What am I supposed to do with these freaks? My God, the world is complicated. Once I get out of Tooxas, I don't understand a thing. It's just towelheads and illegals everywhere, Barbarians and rich foreigners. Plus, you've never read a book in your life. How do you expect to understand it? Help me out here. Call my advisor on foreign countries. What's she good for? Find her for me, Mama Dubya! She's always running around like a mouse around my white house. Little Condolence Risotto? That's the one! Go get her! Of course. You're right, Risotto. We don't need them anymore Goddamn, the Empire of Good can stand on its own two feet now! It can do whatever it wants. Let's break some heads! Guards! Guards! Go get your big shit sticks and throw these Barbarians down the trapdoor! Down the hatch! Down the hatch! SUNDAY, JUNE 1 ANTONIN ARTAUD Never let yourself be put in a coffin! SAME DAY BERTOLT BRECHT What surprises me is that he adopted the habit of counting people and recording them, like he was scared of losing them. Usually, they're not like that. But they want to know that we're exactly X and not Y. As though that mattered in the slightest for those dying of starvation. MONDAY, JUNE 2 PETER HANDKE "When the child was a child, it walked with its arms swinging, "wanted the brook to be a river, the river to be a torrent, "and this puddle to be the sea. "When the child was a child, "it didn't know that it was a child. "Everything was soulful, "and all souls were one. "When the child was a child, it had no opinion about anything, "had no habits." "When the child was a child, "it was the time for these questions: "'Why am I me, "'and why not you?' "'Why am I here, "'and why not there?' "'When did time begin, "and where does space end?' "'Is life under the sun not just a dream?'" CHAPTER 4 PROMISE MADE SUNDAY, JUNE 8 AIMÉ CÉSAIRE "I would arrive sleek and young "in this land of mine, "and I would say to this land "whose loam is part of my flesh: "'I have wandered for a long time, "'and I am coming back to the deserted hideousness of your sores. "I would go to this land of mine, and I would say to it: "'Embrace me without fear... "'And if all I can do is speak, it is for you I shall speak.'" Oh my God! Mr. Paul! Quiet, everybody. Shut up! I have big news. Where are you bags? Did you lose your treasures? Did you get robbed? It's serious. Oh yeah? What happened? I saw Paul B. I saw Paul B. Well, at least he's alive. -You saw him? -That's what I'm saying. -Where? -In Carouge. -You weren't dreaming? -No. It was him. I'm positive. I saw him. -How did he look? -It's hard to say. Did you talk to him? No. He turned the corner and disappeared. Yeah right. Sounds like a joke. It's true. It was him. SATURDAY, JUNE 14 DIDIER-GEORGES GABILY "Corpses must be an obsession for me... "Or they became one as a result of all this." "Someone gave me a book, and last night, I came across this passage: -'"Corpses if you want.'" -Let me see. "Nothing happens, as we all know. "Or so many things happen that, "as we all know, we can't do anything about them. "We are walking on corpses, and yet we go on trying to act "and think as though we weren't walking "and trampling upon the corpses of over a half-century of catastrophes, "of all manner of defeat and abdication. "Today, the corpses have piled up to our very streets. "The corpses of advanced liberal society "in a state of advanced decomposition." "If it's not too late, "we would like for that which makes us citizen-actors, "including our own blind-spots of still-living citizens, "including without a real space for hope, serve to resist, "even partially, even infinitesimally, "the domination of 'ready-not-to-care' for everyone." "Because, in spite of it all, "as with art, so it is with theater: "that which is best is always against worldliness "and all against the world. "That probably won't stop the almost-corpses "from proliferating on our streets. "It might just make it possible to see them as beings "and to give each of them a face, a name, "a voice that also speaks in the theater "and not on reality TV, without pity, without pathos, "the way they envision the world, and us in it, "senseless, defeated specimens, "dying by the force of our dead eyes, "announcing that which lies in wait for us if we renounce ourselves, "if we refuse to fight, saying: 'Nothing happens.'" Do you know the Uzbek saying? "When all has been destroyed, continue to seek out beauty." Let's get to work, comrades! I'm sick of always being against this, against that. Anti-globalization. Anti-constitutionality. That's the longest word in French. -Anti-clerical! -Antinomic! -Antibiotic! -Antechamber! -Anti-tank. -Antitrust! -Antifreeze! -Antilope! -Antispasmodic! -Anti-rust! -Antiquarian! -Antiquity! -Let's be anti-anti! -Two negatives make a positive! -Let's be for! -For what, though? -For dreams! -For poetry. For sex! Yeah, who wants some? Yeah! We have to come up with new slogans. Quiet! SAME DAY ARTHUR RIMBAUD On the blue summer evenings, I shall go down the paths Getting pricked by the corn, crushing the short grass. In a dream, I shall feel its coolness on my feet. I shall let the wind bathe my bare head. I shall not speak. I shall think about nothing. But endless love will mount in my soul. And I shall travel far, very far, like a gypsy, Through the countryside, as happy as if I were with a woman.
