Director DETLEF SIERCK Came, 0/1, come to me Tonight in secrecy When: no one’s eyes can see Only you Yes, you alone Mean happiness and life to me Wonderful, wasn't it? Wonderful? Hmph! But it isn't over yet, ladies. - I've had enough noise for my money. - But it was really... You haven't seen anything yet. The best singer in Puerto Rico... in all of Central America... is next. No, thank you. One bawler is the same as the next. Come, Astrée. I trust you've had enough as well. Chauffeur! La Habanera, madam. Don Ramiro, the best singer in... All of Central America. I know. - Listen, Auntie. - To what? La Habanera. I'm already so sick of it. It's all I've heard on this island for the last two weeks. If you please, madam. Astrée! Where to now, ma'am? The wind sang me a song 0f happiness too beaua'fu/ to descnbe It knows what causes my heart to long For whom it beats And burns like ﬁre Come Would you stop singing and slow down, you poor devil! Drive out of the city. And without singing, if possible. Don’t you like La Habanera? Why insult the chauffeur? I'll never forgive you for dragging me... to this noisy, hot Puerto Rico. It's beautiful here, Auntie. I'm never leaving. - What do you mean, never? - Never. - Thank God the steamer leaves tomorrow. - Without rne. Have you lost your mind? It's high time you return to Stockholm. You and that cold, pretentious Swedish society... what do any of you know of nature? Nature? You're really acting like a savage. That's right. Like a savage. Isn't it wonderful, Auntie? Paradise. Look there. You act like you've never even seen the Riviera! At least there are hotels there with running water and no ﬂeas. The people are civilized and well-bred, and not savages! I prefer the savages. Drive on, Manoelo. Stop, you big horse! - Have you no eyes in your head? - Out of the way, you fat pig! Reidor! If you don't turn around right now... - Out of my way, you ﬁlthy shark! - Get out, you shabby jackass! Get out! I'll get out and beat you to a pulp! You mangy dog! Can't you do this without screaming? There is a bullﬁght here, madam. You swine! The only bullﬂght in Puerto Rico, held just once a year. - The street is blocked. - Then drive around it, idiot! You are entirely right, madam. He is an idiot. Three wonderful bulls from Mexico. Don Pedro brought them especially for today. First-class bulls... as big as elephants and as strong as lions. Don't worry. We'll drive on in a moment. I'm driving the president of the United States. She'll have you hanged if you don't clear the street immediately. I'll take you to the gallows, you cheeky devil! It won't start for another 10 minutes. The president says you should remove your dirty uniform and... Impudent fellow! My God! It's Don Pedro! This is an inexpressible pleasure for me, ladies. My name is Pedro de Avila. Please do not expect a bullﬂght... like in the big arenas of Mexico or Madrid. This is just a village corrida, held only once a year. It's part of my duties as patron... so it's an even greater honor for me. Make way. Make way for Don Pedro de Avila! Come on. Isn't this wonderful, Auntie? An excellent bull. From the best Spanish breeders. Excellent! Isn't that dangerous? A little, but that's how the people want it. Look! This is barbaric! Thank God the steamer leaves tomorrow. Tomorrow? - Yes. - What a pity. The matador is very pale. I think he's afraid. That would be very bad for him. Why don't you help him? As you command. A sword! Auntie, were you calling me? Your father was a tasteless man with his elk hunts and bear hounding... but you're even more of a dilettante. Village corridas... and not even Spaniards, but ﬁlthy natives... and you look on as if under a spell. - I watched it. - You certainly did. Yes, but you watched, too. Of course I looked. But at least I was outraged. Did you see how he struck the blow? You saw it. A single thrust to the center of the heart. You might as well be the bride of a village torero. That's just like you. That would be a hundred times better... than a banker's wife in Stockholm. You've gone mad! Thank God I've gone mad. I'm so sick of those hopelessly oold Swedish minds. The steamer leaves tomorrow. Dr. Luis will prescribe ice compresses to calm you. I've come... I've come to inform you the fellow wasn't badly hurt. Really? He'll be back on his feet in less than two weeks. Mr. de Avila. Astrée, come! Yes, I'm coming. Is this your fan? Yes. It fell in the arena. Thank you. I should thank you. What for? What for? Stop pretending you don't know about the game with the fan. The knight courts the lady by presenting the opened fan. She consents by accepting. Charming Puerto Rican custom. I didn't know... really. You should have read the guide book. It describes it there. Of course, I won‘t insist if Senorita Astrée didn't know. You can be sure she didn't know. And mind you, she just reads them! Are you saying that Senorita Astrée doesn't live them? You're shameless, Don Pedro. Thank God the steamer leaves tomorrow. You're very charming to still be our friend despite yesterday's little incident. It wasn't an incident for me, madam. Farewell, Don de Avila. Come, Astrée! May I hope you will return someday? Perhaps. Just perhaps? You're really a savage. Come! Must I wait long for you to come again? I don't think so. Yes, Auntie. Steward ! Yes? I ordered two cabins, not two rattraps. I'm very sorry. I don't want your pity. Where's the purser? This way, please. Astrée, wait here, you hear? Come with me. The wind sang me a song You may go. I'll walk home. I want to stay here. I don‘t like sea voyages. All that back and forth. - Looking for a young lady, madam? - Yes. You‘re the ﬁrst intelligent person I've met on this ship. Where is she? A young lady left the ship at the last moment. But the ship is leaving! Yes, it is. I never thought a woman had the courage... to turn back at the last moment. It was actually the Habanera. The Hahanera. It was more the Habanera than you. The servants wish the young couple good luck as they enter the house. The bride and groom thank you. Rosita. This is Rosita, my old nanny. She's really a Carib called Inokaparet, but nobody can pronounce that... so I named her Rosita. She's been the mistress of the house. Rosita, give your lady the keys. Quick! You're hurting her. Why do I need the keys? Please take them. It's our custom. I'll give Rosita something for them. Here, take this. Take the ring, Rosita. A telegram. - For me? - Yes. I didn't think anyone had anything more to say to me. '145 a wedding gift; I will pay for the divorce. Aunt Anna" Very well. You can go now. From Aunt Anna. - May I read it? - No! Well, all right. You're all I have now. Come. Let me show you your chambers... just the two of us. Dr. Nagel. Dr. Gomez. - Hello, Doctor. - Hello, deerblom. Back in Stockholm again? You look great. I'm glad for you. For a while, you looked rather bad... almost puny. Still chasing alter germs? I try not to swap roles with them. They could just as easily be after me. The germs? - So how is your gallbladder? - My gallbladder. Tell my colleague, Dr. Gomez, all about it. He's a specialist. Do me a favor and attend to this sick man. Good-bye. Are you really a specialist? Something's wrong with my gallbladder. Doctors are always excused for being late. Being late is a professional trick, madam. We must appear to be very busy or no one believes us. Especially not you, the charming founder of our Tropics Institute. Elwa, this is Dr. Nagel, Stockholm's most fashionable physician. Elwa has come to see you about her nervous condition. That won't be possible. I'm off on a trip. I'll just be here for 15 minutes. It's like tension with sour reﬂux. Not always. Not right now, for example. Sour isn't the right word. Bitter is a better word. But it isn't really bitter. It's more like yeast, if you've ever eaten yeast. - Of course, heaps of it. - Heaps of it? I've never eaten yeast. Nobody eats yeast. No, but you said sour. I didn't say sour. I didn't mean sour. Just a moment. No, that wasn't it. But it‘s deﬁnitely not sour. Why do you keep looking at your watch? Because it's already 4:30 and our plane leaves at 5:00. - Farewell. - And where are you off to? Puerto Rico, in the service of your foundation. Where? Puerto Rico. The Caribbean. I was told you instigated this expedition to research Puerto Rico fever. Yes, a few years ago I asked the Institute to ﬁnally do something. The Americans are so lax. The Rockefeller Institute gave up after its failure eight years ago. But I never dreamed you would 90, Doctor. Come with me for a moment. Excuse me, Elwa. It's like a painful twinge. No, "shooting pain" is more exact. No, it's not a twinge or a shooting pain. It's a pounding pain with sour reﬂux. - The ceiling is falling down. - So what? He's not a specialist. Ten years ago. So that would have been 1927? Yes, 10 years ago. My God! Ten years is a horribly long time. I can't ﬁnd the photo right now. But I think you remember my niece. By the way, weren't you close to Astrée back then? Didn't you know I was madly in love with her? But somehow I didn't have the courage. None of us did. I wish you or one of the others had shown courage. Then she and I would have been spared her marriage... to a village torero in Puerto Rico. Seriously? Is he really a village torero? Of course not. The knight's name is Don Pedro de Avila. He‘s a Carib, a Creole. What do I know? Straight from the Middle Ages. A feudal lord... and a hard nut for the American government to crack. You know, Astrée was always so dramatic. There's one thing I don't understand. Just one? You ﬂatter yourself, Doctor. You'll ﬁnd hundreds of things you don't understand in Puerto Rico. There's one thing I don't understand... at the moment. You've had no word from Astrée in 10 years? And you've been silent for 10 years? You don't know the Sternhjelms, Doctor. We're loners, and very proud, especially the women. Fa/k from the Aﬂonb/adet newspaper, madam. Hello, Doctor. May we photograph the founder of the Tropics Institute and her envoy? Please do. I'm just cheeky enough... to be photographed with the Don Juan of Stockholm doctors. Come, Doctor. - Ready? - Yes. Thank you, madam. Good-bye, Doctor! It's almost 5:00. Good-bye now. Don‘t you dare breathe a word about me to Astrée. And stay away from scandals, my friend. Thanks for the warning, but I don't stand a chance against a torero. He slays bulls... and that's so much more exciting than my germ-hunting. So you can depend on me. Depend on you? I‘ll do everything to bring Astrée back with me. That's not what I meant! Your Excellency? The special plane from Stockholm with the two gentlemen... from the Anna-Sternhjelm Tropics Institute Foundation just landed. Dr. Sven Nagel, physician from the Bacteriology Institute... of the Stockholm Sternhjelm Foundation... and Dr. Luis Gomez from Rio deJaneiro... also on behalf of the Institute. The intruders are here! Dr. Sven Nagel and Dr. Luis Gomez, two nosy fellows. One Swedish, the other Brazilian. We've been expecting these louts, right, Shumann? We'll stop these damned snoops, won't we? You can be sure of that, old boy. I'll make their lives miserable. Odd that our salvation should come from Sweden and Brazil, of all places. Our friend Don Pedro de Avila is spitting ﬁre and smoke. The Rockefeller Institute sent their snoops here eight years ago. The result: a serum questioned by every authority. Because of the newspaper drive! about infectious diseases in Puerto Rico... trade was decimated for three years. The island plunged downhill and the affair toppled my predecessor. Can you imagine something so impudent? They come here to look for germs and ruin our economy... and maybe even spread the fever abroad on one of my ships. This fever doesn't exist, Shumann. Do you understand? Don Pedro de Avila says that there's no more fever in Puerto Rico. That's the official line he's issued. And the best conﬁrmation of it is that the Rockefeller Institute was here. Puerto Rico fever. I can already see the headlines in American newspapers. Just like it was back then... but this time there may be another headline. What do you think of this? "Dr. Sven Nagel and Dr. Luis Gomez Deported from Puerto Rico. " Get me Professor Pardway. I assume these meddlers will head for the hospital ﬁrst. Scoundrels! Your Excellency. Thank you. Hey, listen. - Pretty nice, isn't it? - Who is this Pedro de Avila? The founder and local bigwig who tyrannizes the American prefect. And you mean to... I'm always for charging right into the lion's den. They're coming. Listen closely. These are the orders of the prefect: The two strangers mustn't see anything here. Absolutely nothing. Especially no cases of Puerto Rico fever. - Understand? - Yes. They mustn't be allowed near patients or take a single drop of blood. We don't want the mess we had eight years ago. All right, gentlemen. You may leave. Professor, I believe these two men know more than we think. Why? They show up exactly two days before the start of the fever wind... and the mass fever outbreak. There is no fever, gentlemen! Close the door. There is no fever! That is our ofﬁcial stance. The politicians want us to deal with this evil ourselves... and avoid problems with Washington and trade partners... and above all with Don Pedro de Avila. There's nothing for these foreign doctors to ﬁnd here. You know everyone in Puerto Rico thinks like Don Pedro. He rules this island. He's the idol of the people. And we have to get along with the ofﬁcials. As doctors we're obligated to Don Pedro... because he founded this hospital. Juan is nine years old. For 200 years the heir in our family, upon reaching the age of nine... has attended the bullﬁght on our patron saint's day. You can't prevent me... from raising my son as my successor. Do you hear me? Don't accuse me of taking Juan from you too early. I've left him with you long enough. I've watched how you've made him into your friend... and estranged him from me. You're cruel and egotistical. I'm sorry I must tell you this. You want to make him into a Swede... but now I'm asserting my claim. I won't ask again! You must obey rne! I know very well that you don't have to ask me. You are the master here. Not just in this house, but on the entire island. I tore it. You know that dress brings back unpleasant memories. I hate that dress! I asked you never to wear it again. Because an English marine ofﬁcer once thought it was pretty. Your jealousy is really incomprehensible. Perhaps for you. I know you‘d deceive me with the ﬁrst man to come along... if you dared. Believe me, I would dare... if it was what I wanted. No, you wouldn't dare... because you know it would mean losing Juan to me. That's the only thing that stops you from leaving me. Of course, you're right. I wouldn't dare because ofJuan. But Pedro, at least don't force him to watch this horrid bullﬁght. The women will swooning wide-eyed at my little man. On this day 29 years ago, your father stood where you now stand... and Idressed him as I'm now dressing you. But your father didn't cry. He also didn't have a mother... who sang to him foreign songs full of tears. You had a different opinion of the bullﬁght 10 years ago... to this very day. Ten years ago today I was mad, just like Aunt Anna said. I was tired of those stiff, wind-beaten... tradition-bound faces in Stockholm back then. Back then? Exactly. Back then! Today you would shout for joy and run back to Stockholm... if you could take Juan with you. Yes, I would! What I've suffered here! What I've had to put up with! This country is still foreign to me, just as you're still foreign to me. I've been abandoned by everyone, left all alone. Everything that seemed so charming 10 years ago... has turned repulsive: this eternal summer, the stupid gaiety that gets on my nerves... the Habanera that drives me crazy. I thought this was paradise... but it's hell. I feel the fever wind days in advance. This is the 10th season that I must endure it. Don't you understand that I'm wasting away here? Thank you for such honesty. The boy will be in my old nanny's care from now on. My child? You just informed me you only stay with me on his account... so don't expect me to be considerate. Get it through your head that I'm taking Juan from you. He's a native-born Puerto Rican... and will one day regret... that he was born of a Swedish mother. Yes, madam? Have a horse saddled. I want to ride into the city. Hurry! It was a blunder to blurt it all out. They were clearly uncomfortable... but you had to have your way. Apparently they weren't ready for us. They didn‘t have wine or ﬂowers. The table wasn't set. You already know from the Philippines how the natives act... when strangers come and stick their noses into everything. Did you hear that there is no more Puerto Rico fever? The Lambert Commission from the Rockefeller Institute got rid of it. Every lab technician knows that the Lambert serum wasn't even approved. Yes, it's quite a joke. The medical superintendent appears to be on the defense. He doesn't want outside help. They probably had enough back then. Because of the sensationalist press... the island's economy was ruined for three years. Got a light? They won't be able to keep it secret for long. The fever's already in the air. Vile stuff, especially for the nerves. You can practically smell it. I can't smell it, but I can almost feel it. Who was that? She hasn't changed a bit. You know her? Is she Swedish? - Yes. - You know her? Of course. Didn't I tell you it's a small world? - So who is she? - Who is she? The Queen of Sheba! What? That's what we called her before she left Stockholm. How did the Queen of Sheba get here? You knew she was here? Yes, I knew. What an idiot I am... thinking we came here because of the Puerto Rico fever! That is why we're here, Luis. I'm just good at killing two birds with one stone, that's all. - Things are looking dark. - They look rosy to me. Come, let's hurry back to the hotel and unpack. The Skan'ga is your only choice, madam. From Paraton to New York, with a connection to Cherbourg on July 12th. - Arrive here at 7:30, leave at 10:00. - Is there no earlier ship? No, madam. Just the Skanga on July 12th. That's a Thursday. A week from tomorrow. The 12th is a lucky day. Friday the 13th would be much worse. - I'll take a cabin. - One? - Two. - Two ﬁrst-class cabins to New York. With a connection to Europe. You want to go to Europe? I was at the Red Star ofﬁce in London for four years. I was in Paris too. Ah, Paris! Puerto Rico is awful once you've lived in the big city. I don't like these barbarians here. I asked you to send a telegraph! Of course. May I ask for a small down payment? Perhaps 10%? - I'll pay the full fare right now. - As you wish. Here. Mama, it must be beautiful in Sweden! Yes, darling. Much more beautiful than here. What is snow? Snow? Snow is millions and billions of frozen angel tears. Masses of tiny little stars, very soft and cold... that melt in your hand when you touch them. And if you lick your hand... they're not bitter like human tears... but slightly sweet. Sweet? Of course. They're angel tears. Of course. But why do the angels cry? They feel sorry for us humans. They feel sad for us. Mama, when can I see real snow? Darling, you'll see snow soon. I'll show you tons of it. And we'll ride through the winter forest on a sled. Great! Did Poverio make my sled right? Can I ride on the snow with it? Yes, indeed. You'll see. It'll take your breath away as it ﬂies down the mountain. Will you sing the song you wrote for me? Yes, but you must come closer... because I have to sing it very quietly. You're so pretty today. As long as you love me, darling... I love you like crazy, Mama. I always want to be pretty for you, just you. You must be proud of your mother. I'm terribly proud of you. Now let's hear the song. You just cannot know How there are Mir/mg white swirls of snow You just cannot know How silent the house stands When the winter wind blows A star melts on the tip of your nose While hundreds more kiss your cheek You just cannot know How the lake shines when the ice glitters so You just cannot know How the ﬁost puts its art on show Painting the windows With ﬂowers so cold And how the parlor Smells like hazelnuts You just cannot know How app/es simmer while the oven glows You just cannot know How secretly So no ear or eye detects it Mother practices A Chn'stmas song with you From heaven on high All of this you cannot know I want to go to Sweden. We're leaving for Sweden a week from Thursday. - You and me. - Thursday. Just sleep 10 more nights and then we leave. The ﬁrst cases of Puerto Rico fever are coming in. Excuse me? There is no fever! How often must I tell you that? It's nothing more than dysentery! You understand? The 11th case of dysentery. Professor, if things continue like this, we'll run out of beds soon. Beds! That's the least of our problems. Come in. Please excuse the interruption. We're on the way to the club... That's ﬁne. We'll meet Don Pedro de Avila there. You know I don‘t want any trouble with him. What can I tell him? Disaster has set in with the fever wind. Tell us about the Swede and Brazilian. They've been trying to gather materials since their arrival two days ago. Not so loud. The walls have ears. What kind of material? Infected blood from patients containing the pathogens. - But they haven't succeeded? - Not yet. The pathogens still aren't visible at this stage. But from this point on they could succeed at any moment. Where is the center of the outbreak? As always, Your Excellency, on the waterfront. I'm having the two men shadowed... but wouldn't it be safer to have the military seal off the waterfront... so no one can get in or out? I didn't dare ask you, but that would be best. But the guards who seal off the area are naturally in danger of getting infected. But you vaccinated the military with that stuff... From the Rockefeller Institute. But the Lambert serum is controversial and hasn't been ofﬁcially approved. I can't worry about that. I'll have the entire area sealed off. I agree. If anything comes up, call me at the club. Good evening. Good evening. Don Pedro de Avila won't be triﬂed with. The prefect seems afraid of him. No wonder. Don Pedro has powerful friends in Washington... ever since the economic disaster here on the island... caused by the Lambert Commission. Do you think the Swedish and Brazilian doctors... if they get the materials they're after... will succeed in accomplishing... what the Lambert Commission and we ourselves haven't been able to do? - We can hardly assume that. - Hardly? That's not very reassuring. AIB/CDIEEG 7he snow in the garden is up to my knees The cuckoo sang the summer long In our woods its cuckoo song I'LLJ/K To Africa he’s ﬂown away LIN/MOP He doesn't have a sled So why should he stay here Q/KSEUzl/zw Away he ﬂew Far away he ﬂew Tra la la la loo X and Y, too So where can I ﬁnd a cuckoo Now that winter is here I 'l/ just leave and take a walk To buy you a cuckoo clock We already have one on the wall And when eight times the cuckoo cal/s then it wrll really be time For this boy of mine to hop into bed As quick as can be And that’s the end of that They won‘t let you near any fever cases. You won't ﬁnd any viral material today. I'll have it within the hour. I'm going to the waterfront. Only the devil can stop me... from rounding up some of those little bacillus beasts. Damn! There it is. At least we've got that. If they ﬁnd out we're conducting experiments in a hotel room... it'll be our necks. When we have the original beast by the tail, it won't be so bad. I brought the preparation we made from the cells in New York... so we can do a parallel analysis. Let's get to work. I'll eat my hat if the New York preparation doesn't have... exactly the same effect on the original Puerto Rico cases. I'll hand you your hat. The original cases take a completely different course... than those transmitted by rats. The Lambert Commission was on the wrong track. - I‘d put my hand in ﬁre to prove it. - You'll burn it. - What? - Your hand. Just wait and see. Okay, I'm off. Good luck. Prepare everything for a test, for copies, and for a parallel analysis. - Take a revolver with you. - What? Take a revolver. These people don't like doctors who throw the place into bankruptcy. I'll pick up a machine gun on my way. Don't forget to cover the keyholes. When I come back, I'll give seven quick knocks. Seven quick knocks? Good. Did a war break out here or something? What do I know? Keep your jokes to yourself. The waterfront is sealed off. - To whom? - To everyone. Come back here! I have a girl just a few houses down. She's longing to see me. - Cigarette? - I'm not kidding. Turn back. What's wrong? You look all yellow. Damned wind! Turn back. All right. But you could at least go in my place. She's a great girl. My God, what's wrong with you? It got me. Fever? He's unconscious. So I have one. He's had it. Poor guy's in a coma. Poor guy. Come help me over here! A fever victim. Get him to the hospital right away. Holy Mary, Mother of God. Do you feel hot, my child? Terribly hot. Hold onto the thermometer. What time is it? It's 3:00. Didn't you go to bed? Yes, darling, but I got up again. You called out in your dreams. Hold it tight. I am, Mama. Just nine more times to sleep and then we leave for Sweden. Yes, darling. Then we leave. Seven knocks. Just a moment. I'm coming. Close it good and tight. What are you doing? It was too hot. Did you get something? Enough to wipe out all the rabbits in the world. It was a guard. The military has sealed off the entire waterfront. Guards are everywhere. The poor guy fell into a coma, right into my arms. I never saw this in the cases in New York. The fever occurs very differently here. Very sudden. - Probably because of the climate. - Not just that. It must be something else. But we'll ﬁgure it out. I‘ll look at the smear under the microscope ﬁrst, just to be sure. The man fell down as if someone had hit him on the head. Look at this. Look at that! You see? Pretty things, aren't they? - Not easy to see. - No. Incredibly turbulent. Am I a lucky dog? One hundred. One hundred, and another hundred. Three hundred and 300. Six hundred and 1,000. Your Excellency, the telephone. I'll take it oulside. - A thousand. - Yes. I‘d like to see them. Very well. Good. You won. Of course. Why of course? Lucky at cards, unlucky in love. What does that silly comment mean? Nothing. It's just a saying. But there is something else: What exactly are you planning to do in Europe, Don Pedro? In Europe? The day before yesterday your wife booked two cabins... on the Skariga for the 12th. I've promised my wife this trip for years. She wants to see her homeland again. Professor Pardway was on the telephone. The Swede and Brazilian have material. What does that mean? I had the waterfront sealed off so they couldn't get contaminated blood. But one of the guards has been taken to the hospital. He's in a coma. Only minutes left to live. A doctor took blood from his arm. Dr. Pardway swears it wasn't a local doctor. These foreigners were lucky enough to get their hands on evidence. Now we'll have the same mess as with the Lambert Commission. We're ﬁnished! Bad luck for you. If the men from the Tropics Institute got material... then it must be taken away from them. I'm afraid that won't help much. If the Tropics Institute conﬁrms their ﬁndings, that would be the end of us. Every paper in the world would pounce on the story. Leave this to me from now on, Your Excellency. I'm on a lucky streak, Shumann says. I'll have these men over tomorrow... and stop their game somehow. Sven. Give me my diagrams. Turn on the light. I have the feeling there's someone outside. I think we're on the wrong track. The Lambert Commission also made a fundamental error with the derivatives. But we still must do the experiment. Don't let your nerves get to you, understand? - There's someone outside. - What? Pull yourself together. You can go to bed. Excuse me. I thought I saw your light on. - I was with Juan. He isn't well. - What? I hope it's not serious. No, just a bit of a fever. A cigarette case. Thank you. Just put it there. But Juan's not so ill... that he couldn't go on an ocean journey, right? I'm determined to go back to Europe. I had them reassign your cabins... to two foreigners who want to leave the island. You shouldn't read Swedish newspapers. It just makes you more homesick. You wouldn't deny me a trip with my son. By the way, do you know a Dr. Sven Nagel? What would I have to do with Dr. Nagel? He'll be taking your cabin... in case you're interested. He happens to be in this picture with your aunt. If he knows her, then I must assume... you may also know him. Yes, I know him. I mean, we used to know each other. Eleven years ago. An old ﬂame? Yes, an old ﬂame, if you will. Did you know he's here? It's in the newspaper you're looking at. Sorry. I didn't mean to ruin your paper. You may value the picture of an old friend. By the way, I've invited him here. Tomorrow night. - No! - Afraid of the memories? Don't you see I can't stand to be reminded? What else will you ﬁnd to torment me with? Haven't you had enough? He'll be leaving soon. On Thursday the 12th. But they came here to ﬁght this horrible fever. Puerto Rico is none of their business. We take care of our own. You take care of your own! Last year almost 200 people died of the fever here. Almost 200 people! Rumors about these men's work will spread around the world. Newspapers pick up these rumors and exaggerate them. That's exactly how it was eight years ago. The men from the Lambert Commission found nothing to ﬁght the fever... except a dubious serum. They drove half the world crazy, and we couldn't sell our products. Your products. As a result, 20,000 people starved to death in those three years. They didn't die from the fever. You're insane. My thoughts have never been clearer. Blame me for the 200, if it makes you feel better. I can deal with my own conscience. And don't forget: We're having guests tomorrow evening... 25 people. Good night. If I were a pious man, I'd say a prayer of thanks. Damned junk! Prayers and curses back to back... you're a man of great reﬁnement! We did it! Careful, you scoundrel! It feels great to track down murderers like these... and ﬁnd the remedy to ﬁnish off the beasls. Don't start weeping... or I'll have a crying ﬁt. It's just the light. We really had amazing good luck in ﬁnding the preparation. If the soldier hadn't been vaccinated with the Lambert serum... the results would have been negative. Won't the fellows in New York be happy? The mail, sir. No doubt a summons for conducting experiments in a hotel room. Don't tempt fate. Airmail from Stockholm. No stamp. Delivered by messenger. A love letter? Read it to me. Don Pedro de Avila is honored to invite... Dr. Nagel and Dr. Gomez this evening. White tie. The car will be in front of the hotel at 8:00. That's the Queen of Sheba's husband. My good fellow... I'm going to see Astrée Sternhjelm at 8:00! We only have four hours! I have to get a haircut. Where's my jacket? - Over there. - Of course. First work, then play. Clean up here. I need a shave and a bath. You order breakfast. Oh, and get out my clothes. And get a haircut too so you don't disgrace me. Get going now. Clean up! The Queen of Sheba! Go, Pracho, go! Faster! AIB/CDIEEG 7he snow in the garden is up to my knees Mama, you have to sing along. The cuckoo sang the summer long Mama, sing with me. The cuckoo sang the summer long In our woods its cuckoo song I'LLJ/K To Africa he’s ﬂown away LIN/MOP He doesn't have a sled So why should he stay here QIRIST U/VIW Away he ﬂew Far away he ﬂew Here comes the mountain, and then down to the valley. You have to sit on the sled, Mama. Yes, darling. You must wrap a blanket around you. It's very cold and we're going downhill. The wind will surely whistle. You won't turn the sled over, will you? Sitting tight, ma'am? Scoot up a bit. Here we go. Yes, sir. Let's go, but don't throw me off. Hold on tight! It's better if you close your mouth. Not so fast, sir. I'm afraid of the trees. Hold on tight! Here comes a curve! Close your mouth. Hold tight. Here's another one! We're falling! Right into the snow, ma'am. My hair's full of snow, and I'm all wet. Excuse me. The ﬁrst guests will arrive soon. I'll be ready in a moment. Juanito, take the sled to Poverio. Then go to your room. I want to tell you something beforehand. Yesterday. . . or rather this morning... I was much too severe with you. I'm sorry. You know that I... love you. Even though I don't say it very often. Perhaps because you never give me a chance to. I wanted to tell you that I'm willing... if you want... to go to Sweden with you for a few months in the fall. No... thank you. I don't want to go to Sweden... for a few months. I think we're early. Young man, where did you get that sled? Is it for real? A sled in Puerto Rico! Of all places, where there isn't any snow! Don‘t make so much noise. We're not at home! Is it a real sled? - Where did you get it, my son? - Poverio made it for me. - And where do you ride it? - I ride it with Mama. Yes, but where? There's no snow in sight here. Shall we ride it down the stairs? You've totally lost your mind! Out of the way or we'll run you over. Let's go. Get on, my boy. We're guests here, Sven. You can't ride the sled down the stairs! Out of the way! - Good God! - Watch out! Juan! Great ride, eh? Again! Mama, we really fell... I'm Dr. Nagel. Please forgive me. Dr. Gomez. Me, too. It's been 15 years since I rode a sled. I'm happy you're having such a good time in my house, Doctor. We don‘t have much else to offer you in Puerto Rico. It's really a great sled, isn't it? Sven, behave yourself. Juan, please go to your room. Emilio, put the sled away. Yes, sir. No! Go, darling. Obey Papa. Good night, young man. Say good night. Good night, sir. Astrée, may I introduce Dr. Sven Nagel? From Stockholm, One of your countrymen. Do I have you to thank for the invitation? Did you remember me? Please don't be angry ifI say you're mistaken. It was my husband who invited you. This is the room, Professor Pardway. The other one is next door. Search the suitcases... and the closets and drawers. Close the door. I'm excited to be here in this "island paradise"... as they describe it in the guide books. But this damned fever wind gets to me. I never could tolerate it. Perhaps you shouldn't have come to Puerto Rico. What do you mean? My colleague Dr. Nagel always says: For us doctors, it's not preference but obligation. Aren't you Brazilian? Yes. Isn't there something you could do in your homeland? In my homeland? Of course, there's a lot, but... Hey, Sven, old boy. Having a good time? Cheers! Cheers! I've been so looking forward to our meeting. Yes? And so? How could I have known it would be so terrible? How could I have expected to see you so unhappy? Please stop. I'm shocked. You‘ve suffered so much, and you must still be suffering. You're mistaken. Cheers! You can't deceive me. Even if you were more skilled at deception, you couldn't deceive me. This doctor's eyes have seen too much to be easily fooled. But I speak to you now not as a doctor... but as a countryman, as a fellow Swede... and as a friend from your youth. You're mistaken, I tell you. Really? You gave your boy a sled. What about my boy? You're dying to return to Sweden. My word! This is truly an excellent wine. Please excuse me. Certainly. - Liro. - Yes, sir? - Has anyone called? - No, sir. Phone the Grand Hotel right away and ask for Dr. Pardway. Ask if he's done yet. - Understand? - Yes, sir. Test... Test Bacillus D. Bacillus D. Test results: Four different cultures in four different mediums. Weak potency from vaccinated animals, probably rats. Pathogens are pale blue in color. The corresponding preparation... Slow down, Professor. I can't keep up. Then use shorthand. I don't have all day. The hospital is ﬁlled to overﬂowing. I'm needed there. IfI use shorthand, I won't be able to read the medical terms later. Preparation No. 23, 411... for the purpose of treating protracted and transmitted cases. Effectiveness cannot be proved. Presumably completed work. Test Bacillus DD... DD? Two capital Latin Ds! Latin Ds. Original bacillus: Taken from soldier Fernando Ortez... deceased in the hospital. Today's date. July 3rd, 1937. Believe me, Don Pedro... I don't want a few germ researchers to trip me up like they did my predecessor. You're in danger. It wouldn't be the ﬁrst time. Take my words as seriously as you can. Please go home. Don't worry about me. I bring bad luck. Not for me. You made me very happy. Do you remember the Queen of Sheba? I won't have people saying I'm incompetent... just because the fever is back, damn it! No, Don de Avila! I know what was once between us is still there now. To hell with conventions! It's not about conventions. I have a son. Listen, I've practically been ordered to bring you back to Stockholm. By my aunt. No. Much more romantic orders. Orders from my heart. I don‘t want to leave you here, not after everything I've seen. I don't want to leave here. I'm very happy. It's destroying you here, and your son too. Just look at him. Everything about him is Swedish. At least think of him. The boy is unhappy. He's going to ruin here. You're seeing tragedy where none exisB. The fever wind always wears Juan and me down a bit. That's all. Think of the old days, Astrée. You're tormenting me. I don't want to remember. Your Excellency. What would you do if your wife were unfaithful? My wife? Considering how old she is, I take it that's a rhetorical question. Of course. Would you kindly ask my servant to bring me some water? Certainly. Now if you'll excuse me, I have obligations. You aren't our only guest, Dr. Nagel. I wanted to ask your permission. May I sing a song? You haven't sung in nine years, except toJuan. I‘d like to make amends for an injustice I did to you a while ago. Thank you for making such an effort... on my behalf. Will you sing a Swedish song? No. La Habanera. You think you need my permission to do that? You make me very happy. You're exaggerating. I want to put on the costume you had made for me. Your water, sir. Why water? Bring some wine. Are you enjoying yourself in my home? Yes, thank you. I can only hope you're enjoying yourself as much as I am. Like a ﬁsh in water. You'll earn no doctor's fees off of me. Call Don Pedro's home immediately... and tell His Excellency the prefect that the two foreign doctors... conducted bacteriological experiments in their hotel room. We've conﬁscated the evidence. Nothing stands in the way of an arrest. - I understand, Professor. - And another thing. Stop using quinine. Use Emetine for injections instead. - Emetine? - Yes. Emetine. What are you standing around for? Get on the phone and carry out my orders. You know, the soldier had been vaccinated with the Lambert serum. - Really? - Yes. Ask for the prefect. - Evening, Professor. - Evening, nurse. Could I have been wrong for the past eight years? In the night! am alone Watching and listening deep in my soul Oh, my heart Do you hear How the palm trees sing and rustle The wind sang me a song 0f happiness too beautiful to descnbe It knows what causes my heart to long For whom it beats And burns like ﬁre Come The wind sang me a song 0f the heart for whom I long In the evening I stand by the sea And hope for something What can it be I watched brig/7t birds Fly away, and alas All my happiness Shattered lIke glass The wind sang me a song 0f happiness too beautiful to descnbe It knows what causes my heart to long For whom it beats And burns like ﬁre Come The wind sang me a song 0f the heart for whom I long A thousand thanks. You've given me a great gift today. A gift all my wealth could never buy. That was wonderful, madam! I'd like to change now. - What are you doing here? - Ofﬁcial business, ma'am. We'll make the arrests inconspicuously. Don't worry. We won't make a scene. Who do you mean to arrest? The two germ hunters. As soon as the prefect signs the warrant. The reports are nice and incriminating. Bacteriological experiments in a hotel room. Want to see them? Just a moment. Something isn't right. I'm not interested anymore. I've had enough of this island. - Sven, listen! - Stay out of my way! That was truly marvelous, madam. No native has ever sung the Habanera so well. May I speak with you alone for a minute? A thousand minutes, if you wish. You want the two doctors arrested? Yes, you just made me very happy. I know you want to protect your countryman and friend. How nice that you understand. But here's what I understand: You want to hurt Dr. Nagel because he's my friend. Was! You mean he was your friend! - Because he was and still is and... - Will be? What will you do with him? I'll ruin the careers of these fools... who can‘t see beyond a tiny medical horizon. Everything has consequences in life. You're right. Everything has consequences. Everything! - Where's your friend? - Excuse me? Oh, he's on the terrace. Your Excellency! Yes, Don de Avila? - Have all my orders been carried out? - Every one. My secret orders as well? Do you understand me? No, madam. I'm a free Swedish citizen. I do what I want and accept the consequences. I've committed no crime. I won't ﬂee. - From what? From whom? - You don't know the island... you don't know the Americans failed here eight years ago... and you don't know Don de Avila. None of this is puzzling to me in the least... except you. As an old friend, I believed I had the right to help you. Of course you have a right. That's why I ask you now... please take Juan and me with you to Sweden. Please don't think me a coward. I've been very brave all these years. But he kept threatening to take my child from me... and I had no one. Don't be afraid. - Astrée? - Yes, Sven? Do you still remember our motto at the faculty ball? You don't? "Long live life... " "Long live... love. " I must get changed now. An excellent report... for the government in Washington. I'll take responsibility for the other matter. I won't let those two men off the island until they sign a confession of guilt. That should put an end to their credibility and their medical careers. You can be sure of... that. I don't feel well tonight. Thank you. Arrest those two men right away. Do your duty. We must put an end to... Don Pedro! Puerto Rico fever! My God! Where is Dr. Nagel? Sven! Quick, ﬁnd Dr. Nagel. He has the keys to the suitcase. Someone must get the antitoxin immediately! - What is it, Luis? - Quick! My God! Puerto Rico fever. He's in a coma. Dr. Gomez and I found an antitoxin last night, so there's no danger. We need a fast car! Hurry and get the antitoxin, Luis. I said get a fast car! Every minute is precious. I'll call Dr. Pardway. You know that Dr. Pardway can't help here. We have an antitoxin that can save Don de Avila's life. Get us a fast car, for God's sake! I'm afraid it's no use. Why? Your suitcase and materials were conﬁscated at the hotel. What did you say? Just get the suitcase. I don't care where it is. Hurry! Every minute counts! At Don de Pedro's command, the suitcase with all your materials was... Destroyed. What? Destroyed? Then Don Pedro de Avila... has dug his own grave. Hurry. Good-byes are painful, aren't they, Rosita? Come, Lassau. Turning the castle into a rest home for seniors was actually something... the deceased patron might have approved of, don't you think? Thank you. Since the young man won't be staying, right? Perhaps you'll even come back for a few weeks, Rosita. Must be hard to leave, eh? Theses last two weeks I've done nothing but curse this island, but now... Yes, but now... Mama? Where does that go? - Juan, have you seen the steamer yet? - No. Attention! The steamer is casting off. What? Excuse me. I didn't mean you. I meant the steamer. It's casting off. Let's go up top, young man. We can see better from there. Excuse us. Mama, are you coming? You know, I turned back at the last moment ten years ago... as the steamer was casting off. The island seemed to me like paradise back then. Later it came to seem like hell. - And now? - Now? I have no regrets. Regret is always foolish. La Habanera.
