All right, it's your boy, John. You know, we in the Stan. It's my girl Stacy's crib. Stacy is my bae, that's my girl. That's her crib. And what we about to do, we about to scare her because she been talking about her ex and how he's been stalking her, something like that. To pretty much teach her a lesson. I don't need to bring up his name in my presence. But go ahead, you know, scare her. We're gonna get it all on camera. It's gonna be hilarious. To help me record all this is my girl Stokes with me. Let me show you. What's up, y'all, I'm Stokes. You know what I'm sayin'? Give me the damn camera back, come on. Come on, follow me, let's go. Hey, hey. You're just gonna walk inside? Let's go, come on, come on, come on. She got her headphones in so we know she can't hear us. Shh. All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Let's go, let's go. Shh, shh. Shh! Shh! Come on, let's get inside. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Turn the light out, turn the light out. Okay, go, go, go, go. Let's go. Stop, what are you doing? Oh shit, oh shit, shit. Where'd she go? What was that? Stacy? Oh shit. What were you trying to do? Really, babe? That was just a joke, come on. Seriously? That was not funny. - It's okay. - No, you know what? Whenever my ex is stalking me and you know it and I feel it! Stay away from me, I'm not kidding. Take Stokes and go right now. Nah, don't be that way. You take him and go, right now. No, they're not funny, you know they're not. Stalking, that's not funny. You know what, you've done many jokes before. There's a big difference. This is not a funny joke. Stupid stuff. That's all you ever do is stupid stuff. That was not funny. You and Stokes need to leave. Out of this house, from me. Stokes, hey! Hey, we're gonna need to borrow the camera. Let me use the camera. We talked about this in the car. Dude, what's the point? She's always locking you out. It's okay, she's in a bad mood, she's calming down. I got this, let me use the camera. Don't be this way. All right, all right, all right. I appreciate this, thank you so much. No problem, man. Don't screw up my camera, bro. I'll see you in school on Monday, dumb ass. John? John? Seriously, we just talked about this. John? You left your camera on! Seriously, you think you're gonna prank me in my own home? I don't think so. John? John, this isn't funny. Scene, that new series on... Shy, hold on. I'm setting up the camera, give me a second. I don't know how to, oh, there we go. Okay. I'm not extremely familiar with DSLR so you're just gonna have to - give me just a second. - What the heck is DSLR? It's the digital. I don't know, actually, to be completely honest. I don't even think it's. Yeah, it is, yeah, it is, yeah, it is. Yeah, it is recording. I am, you're the star of the show. - Course I'm gonna get you. - I'm the star of the... Just give me a second. - Oh look, here we go. - Hey! - What's up viewers? - Oh, yeah! Looks good. - Oh, shit, I'm so excited! - Dude, dude, Cheyenne. Seriously, it looks awesome. It looks HD awesome. It looks you're gonna show your Mom the movie awesome. It looks great. Aye, we're about to make a movie, dude! - I know. - Like movie theater awesome? Like I can - be on the movie screen. - Well, I don't think that matters since this isn't gonna go in the movie theater. Um, I need hi-def quality. - Yes, Shy, it's hi-def. - Okay, but I'm just sayin'. It looks good, are you excited? You're gonna be doing this for a month and a half. I'm not camera shy. We can go for two months, three months. I could do a reality show, I mean. I want everything on camera, okay? - I mean everything. - I'll get everything. I got you, I will get it all and, you know, now you just need to tell your mom about the video and we're good to go. Tell my mom about the video. Dude. Shy, we've talked about this. You have to, you've gotta do it, and like now's the time. You have the house, you've got the furniture, you have your roommate, Sam. - Okay, you know what? - Cheyenne. - Let's just do it now. - Maybe you're right. - Yup, let's go. - Wait, no, okay. Hold on, no, actually, no. - You don't understand. - It's never. It is the perfect time. Travis, you don't understand. She will not let go, especially after what happened three months ago. I can't just tell my mom I'm gonna leave her. It's gonna be all right, Shy. You can do it, you just gotta tell her. Hello, hi. - Oh. - Oh my gosh, camera. - Hey, Mom. - Hey, Mrs. Martinson. What's going on with the camera? Well, actually, - funny thing about the camera. - It's just a project, Mom. - It's just a project. - A project? Mm-hmm. How can I help? You know, I'm always here to help with the projects. It's just a project between... Cheyenne has finally decided. No, Travis, it's just a project - between me and Travis. - I think you're Mom should - be in on this. - Cheyenne, you have - finally what? - No, finally to get an A - on a project with Travis. - Oh, finally get an A on a project, oh, that's cute. Camera. Okay, what kinda project is this exactly? - It's for school. - It is a. Okay, both of you, please. Mom, me and Travis need to be alone to finish our project. Okay. That's not the. Mom, come out of the closet! I'm funny, I'm funny, okay, okay. Well, you kids have fun. I still wanna be in the project. Oh wait, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, no, no, no, no, let me just leave it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Oh my God. Um. - What the? - So. Hell just happened? She's drunk. - Finally, come on! - Hey! What's up? Dude, dude, let me sit down. I'm guessing it went good? It went good, I mean like. Heck, yeah, hold on. I keep forgetting you have that camera. I'm excited. I'm moving out, she knows about everything. Oh, heck yeah! She knows about everything, dude. I told her about the house I bought, roommate, everything. We're good to go. Shy, I told, see. I told you she wasn't gonna care. She was gonna understand, now that you're 21. Why are you lookin' at me like that? - What happened? - Because she cared. She was in a whirl of emotions. Wait, so she's not happy? No. She is upset, she is mad, she is pissed, she's scared. Scared, why the hell is she scared? What's she scared for? Dude, what happened to Stacy three months ago. She's scared that whoever went after Stacy is gonna come after me next. Oh my God, Shy, this was three months ago. Whatever happened to Stacy and John had nothing to do with you. - I know. - She was just gonna be your roommate, that's it. She's just being a mom. I'm not scared, I'm ready to move out, I'm 21. - You know what I'm sayin'? - Let's freakin' do this. I'm doin' it, regardless. She shouldn't be worried about that, it's. Whoever did that is not even. No one even knows where there at, what they're up to, what they're doing. I still have to talk to her about the interview. She was kinda hesitant, you know, but knowing that it's for her, she's gonna do it. So when you wanna do that, today? You wanna go ahead and knock that out? Give me another 24 hours to talk to her. She needs to simmer down. Okay. I just need to, I just need to talk to her. But, Shy, dude, we're doing this. - Yes, dude! - It's go time. It is go time, okay. I'm ready. - Yes, hey! - What's up? What's up? Y'all ready? Yeah, we're so excited! Hey, how ya doin'? She's fine. - Yeah? - Let's get goin'. I'm so excited, I've been waitin' for this. So y'all are ready to do the interview and everything? - Yes, we are. - Okay, cool. So what I'm gonna do is, we have the interview room over there. I'm gonna use y'all's couches, set up some lighting, and then we'll go ahead and start it, okay? When are we gonna do it, now? Let's go! All righty, so we are ready, we are set up. Cheyenne, if you wanna go ahead and do your intro. Oh, okay. Well, I'm Cheyenne and this is my lovely mother. Basically, why we're doing this interview and why I'm in front of a camera is 'cause I'm moving out. I'm 21 years old so it's about that time. Well, and I'm making this film for my mom so like a time capsule thing so she can look back on it whenever and see that I'm okay and just for laughs and smiles, and that I'm actually growing up and becoming my own person. My best friend, Travis, is actually coming with me for a month. He's gonna edit it all nice and give it to my Mom just in case she gets worried or ever misses me or wants to know I'm okay, she'll have that video to go back and look at. But, other than that, we're about to have some fun. And I can't wait. Are you sure about this? I'm 100% sure. Look, if anything, if anything, she has Sam and she has me. Yeah, I'm just a phone call away, - come on. - Just stay, just stay. You have to get over it, I'm leaving. Hey, Mom! Interview time, say hey. Hey. All right. Shy. She's not even like talking. Okay, is this on? What are you doing? Whoa, whoa, be careful. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What are you doing? Say hi. Really? Introduce yourself, Travis! No, the deal was I'm the camera guy. You're on camera, that's how it's supposed to go. You're my best friend and I want you to introduce yourself. Uh. Hey, guys, my name's Travis, whoever's watching. Cheyenne's mom, hi. Um. I do video editing, I edit short films, sports features and wedding videos. Yeah, so, anything else? Just talk, please, Travis. I don't know what else to say. You told me to do an introduction, I did an introduction, so. Filming is kinda fun, I like filming. Well, enjoy it now. And enjoy this face, everybody, because I'm behind the camera, and you're not gonna see it much more so. Enjoy it while it's here, okay? Look at this utie. Cut it 'cause I have a serious question. No, it might be good for the film. - We can cut it later. - I can promise you this is gonna be pointless to the film. Oh, well, we can cut it out. Okay. I was just wondering, I know we're doing this for your mom and we're just making a nice little video for her, something that she can look back on, but you are spending a month dedicating time to this and that's why I was wondering there has to be some other reason you're doing this other than just that. What's pushing you? Is there something I don't know that'll help me when I'm editing or what's the deal? You know what I'm saying? What's the real reason? Or is there? Well. You sighed, why'd you sigh? I mean, my mom's just not really good at being alone and I just wanna show her that I'll be okay living by myself and that I can do it. She's just the type of mom to be like, "Cheyenne, be careful, there's murderers out there. "They'll kill you!" They gon break into your house. They gon break into your house and steal yo stuff! Recording. And go. Let's go. I'm excited! I'm so excited. Take this, I'm sorry, I forgot. - What's this? - It's an LED light. So any dark areas you have in your house just be sure to turn it on so the camera can pick up the area. Cool, all right. Wait, wait, one more thing. Has your mom seen the house yet? No, this will be her first time. So it's gotta be like a good. It has to be clean, cut, good. Okay, don't worry, I got you. All right. Okay. This is my house. Take a look around - at the nice wallpaper that. - Oh yeah, nice and modern. All right, so I guess we'll start here. - Okay. - Yeah, close the door. All right, so we call this the haunted hallway. Can you tell why? I can't see anything, can you turn the light on? - See, I think you would... - Oh, let me find this. - There we go. - Look. Oh yeah. Oh my God, this is perfect. Yeah, it's a little bit creepy. - Yeah, just a little bit. - Just a little bit. Just a bit. All right, ooh. Oh my God, this is where I relax, kick back. I know it's not much, but it's my room. So this is it, where we live! In the living room! We have a little chill couch. And this is my favorite place personally, the kitchen, where we cook at! I like to cook. This is where I think is the best personally, is the backyard. Dang, this is nice. I know. Then we have this cool deck, everybody's chillin'. People chillin' over there too. Hmm, hi, say hi to the camera! Hi! - Yes, Ma'am. - You got you a guard dog. Yeah, we got a guard dog now. All righty, okay. Bam. So look at the camera. All right, cool, are you ready? I'm gonna look at you. No, no, no, look at the lens. 'Cause remember you're talking to your mom. It's so weird, okay. Just like visualize your mom. - Okay. - While you're talking to her. All right. And this was my bedroom! For four years. For four years of high school. I can't believe you slept on this bed for four years. Travis, I am a centimeter bigger than a pencil. What's the big deal? Okay. This is one of the many rooms, Mom, that you blessed me with and I am grateful because this was like the sleepover room. - We did, I remember. - This was Travis's room actually. Yeah, because when I would spend the night with Sam you would be in there. - Yeah. - And I would have to sleep in here. Shy. Travis. Don't move. - What the fuck? - Is those diamonds? Diamond earrings? So I guess you noticed my diamond earrings. Who bought you the earrings? Travis. You don't want your mom to know? Not right now. Okay, well, I'm not gonna tell her so thanks for being a horrible friend and... Oh my gosh, okay, shh! His name is Tyler. Oh my God. That's it, that's it! His name is Tyler, let's go. My favorite memories with you are in this room. This used to be the game room but now it's a study for when I moved into high school. We had awesome memories in here. You remember, every Friday night we would have five games - sprawled out on the... - Okay, you said you. Are you talking to me or your mom? Travis, I'm not gonna be like, "Mom, this, Mom, that." You, the camera, you are my mom. It sucks 'cause I'm gonna miss you. I'm over here packing, trying not to be sad because it's just really sad that I'm moving, but it's a happy memory. Is this a good stopping point because I have been holding my pee in like this whole time? Shy, why didn't you just go to the restroom? - I can just cut it. - I need to go! I was feelin' it, man! - Okay, all right. - Let me go. - Yeah, that's fine. - Okay, cool. I don't know why you didn't just ask. Shut up, Travis. Okay. Okay, I have been waiting for this all day, for her to leave, but I'm about to scare the crap outta your daughter. Oh. Oh. Travis? Travis, where are you? Travis? What the hell? Okay. Hell, yeah! Hell, yes! Hell, yeah! I got you, you thought I was under the couch. Shy! Honestly, it was really stressful, but it don't even matter anymore. I know, we're gonna have so much fun tonight. - Hello, hello! - Travis, oh my gosh, hi! - What's up? - How are you? I'm doin' good, how you doin'? I am exhausted, but that's not the point. We're about to turn up. - She's excited. - She's excited. - Yes! - Are you excited? - You're excited. - I'm ecstatic. Sam! Ah, besties fo life! Mm-hmm, doin' this for Shy's mama. And, Mom, this is Sam's room. The nice wallpaper of, whatever, - some plants. - That's gonna be covered up. - Whatever. - Of course, you know. Don't look at the room, it's really, really bad. Yeah, did you have a nightmare? - No, no, no. - Hit the blinds? What happened there? - Don't look at the blinds. - What is that? Look at me, do I look good in the camera? Is the lighting okay on me? I think I look, I mean, honestly, I just got this today if you wanna know the truth. I'm about to get a shot! - We're, this, oh my gosh! - Y'all gonna take shots? Yes! - And then... - 'Cause y'all know I can't take a shot, right? - Oh, no, you're drinkin'. - Travis. But for right now you need tp leave - because I'm about to change. - Hold up, with my camera? - What, yes? - I'm drinking? Yes, with your camera. We're gonna make this work, bye, bye! See you later! Cheers to finally being on our own, right? - Yes, turn up! - Yes! Slap it. Ooh! Ooh! I think I'm good on just that one shot, guys, honestly. - No. - No, you need some more. Actually, just for you, I'm pouring a little extra. - You seeing this? - Ooh! You catchin' this? Turn up, turn up! Put it up, here we go, put it up! - Slam that! - Cheers. Oh yeah. And that one got me feelin' like. - Are you good? - I'm good. Hi! What's up, bro, how you doin'? - I'm doin' good. - Doin' okay? - How are you today? - I'm doin' pretty good. Just, you know, trying to keep her under control. Oh, she's like that? She's trying to get me turnt. She don't understand how... He's turnt, right now. And my Mom knows, say hi to my Mom. Hey, Mom! - Okay. - How you doin'? Hey, over here. He's trying to say hi to my mom. What it do? What it do? Turn up! Oh, I'm about to break it. I caught you! Grab that shot, grab that shot! Grab that shot, oh shit! Oh! Oh, look at Leila. - we're about to go swimming. - Hey, hey. I need to talk to you. We're about to go swimming. Listen to me. Ngh-ngh, my ears are broken. - Cheyenne. - My ears are broken. Your Mom, think about your mom. Can we cut it out, please? All right, Tyler, just go ahead and give us just like an introduction. Just like a little interview, who are you? I'm Tyler. Why do I have to do this? Well, Cheyenne just told me to make sure that you did. And, I mean, I feel you, 'cause I don't like being on camera either, but she made me do it so that's what I'm sayin' like. Just give us like a hi, this is my name, blah, blah, blah. I'm Shy's boyfriend. I'm Tyler. Um. Seriously, can you just cooperate? - Seriously? - What is this? You know what it is, I told you about it! For your mom? For my mom. Babe, just do it. Bro, I'm not comfortable with this. Oh. I'm working it out. Yeah, this is really, really nice. I'm a little jealous. I'm not gonna lie. Yeah. Thank you for doing this for her mom. It means a lot. To not just Shy but to me as well, you know. That's my best friend. I've been wanting to ask this, but I didn't know a good time. But now we're like chilling. I saw the way you looked at Tyler when he got here. What was that all about? Uh, just. Don't really get along with him. Don't. Don't really feel comfortable with him being around me. Dude, what are you not telling me? Okay, can I tell you something? Wait, wait, wait. What's goin' on? I think someone's following me. Wait. Wait. What do you mean, what do you mean following you? After work. Same car. Same route. Same time. Sam. I'm not kidding. Is this another one of your over-exaggerated stories? No, no, it's not. I wish it was. I wake up every night and feel someone watching me. I feel eyes. I can't even walk to my own kitchen and grab food, go to the bathroom. Are you saying that you think, - you think this is Tyler? - All, I'm saying is I don't feel comfortable around him, and I don't feel comfortable in my own home. All right, Tyler. - All right, bro. - Good to see you, man. Hey, thank you for your patience with everything. I know you're not all into it, but. Get used to it. - No problem, man. - 'Cause you got another - month of it. - All right, Sam. - Bye. - Bye, see you later. That's bae! I see you. Sam? What? What are you doing? - That was so obvious! - Shh, stop. So? So? What are you, uh. What do you think about Tyler? You think he's gonna be okay with it or? No. But he is gonna have to deal with it. Yeah, 'cause we got a whole month of this so. Whole month, oh my God. What the hell was that? There's probably just rats or squirrels or something like that. Yeah, you're right. Well, congratulations on your first day of film. Thank you, turn up! It was so much fun. Time to go ahead and sleep. You sleep good, okay? All right, you too, good night. Good night. Hey, good morning. Good morning. You ready for filming day two? I am so ready for filming day two. Good, good, that's what I like to hear. How'd you sleep last night? I slept pretty good. I kept hearing those noises in the attic though. Like constantly, finally it stopped so I was able to go asleep and put the camera down but. Really? Yeah, you definitely have. I think it's just probably a rodent problem or something like that. Yeah, I'm definitely gonna have to call someone out here for that. You haven't heard anything like that before? No, not since last night. But what were you and Sam talking about last night? When? When y'all were over there. Oh. Sam was just being Sam, honestly. It was a stupid conversation. She was just saying that she feels like someone's following her from work. She thinks this person's in this house with us, watching her sleep, and I was just like, all right. I just kinda went along with it. I've heard that before. - Really? - Mm-hmm. She's told me a couple times she feels like someone's following her. But I don't think anything of it because, like you said, Sam will be Sam. Good morning. It is too early for this. What's up? So last night I was hearing these noises. Just, I don't know, out of the ordinary noises. Did you hear them? Every night, just like I told you. So that's the noises you've been hearing that are scaring you? It's just a rodent problem. It's a big ass rodent. Just keep the camera rolling. You never know what you're gonna find. Leila! Leila! Shy! What are you doing? Uh, I think you're gonna hate me. Why? Oh, I can't find the dog. That's because I took her to my mom's house. She wanted to watch her. Stop trippin'. It's 2AM and someone just banged on the door. I don't want no Girl Scout cookies right now. You need to take that somewhere else. Hello? Shy! What are you doing? You scared the hell outta me! You scared the hell outta me. Okay, tonight was the first night that I felt uncomfortable. Did you not hear anything that I told you outside? Someone's following me, someone is here, there's... So many uneasy levels in this house. I do feel kind of uncomfortable now. I kind of see what you were saying. And that's how I feel about Tyler. Being around him is like being in this room at night. Just complete unease. Well, I mean, I'm not gonna lie. Tyler does look tough. Tyler does look scary. And when I have heard things, he's not here. But is he ever on camera besides that one attempt to put him on an interview? Nah, he doesn't like to be on the camera. All right, Tyler, let's try this again. You ready, Cheyenne? Yeah. - Tyler. - Mm-hmm. This is really important for me, and this is really important to my mom. This is gonna be the first time that you introduce yourself to my mom. So I want you to take this seriously, all right? My past is pretty bad. I don't like talking about it, but Imma talk about it right now. When I was seven, I had a really bad experience with my Mom and her boyfriend because he used to come from a childhood that beat, that got beaten all the time. So he went on to my mom with that. I was too young to do anything, but it just got to me. I just snapped. It was time for him to go and I had to go to jail. I just got out not too long ago. But I'm trying to show everybody that I'm a changed person. I'm just trying to make her as comfortable as possible. Are we done? Is that everything? Are you comfortable, Cheyenne? Yeah, honestly, we're done. It's good. Okay, action. Action, action, action, action, action. All right. I took Travis's camera and he's asleep, but he's not gonna know. Actually, he is gonna know. Say hi. - Ngh-ngh. - Say hi. No. Ty! This is pointless. Why don't we just put the camera down and actually do something with it? No, this is for my mom! Are you serious? Stop! Stop. Tyler, oh my god, stop. What? This is for my mom, seriously? - Stop, Tyler. - Why? - Tyler. - Please. - Tyler. - Please, Shy. Babe. - Babe. - Hmm. Listen up, I gotta go. No. I'm about to be late for work. No, don't go. I'm sorry, but I have to. All my clothes are at home. Tyler, can you please just stay? I promise I'll come back after. You'll come back after work? I promise I'll call you when I'm on my way. All right, give me a kiss. Okay, don't forget to call me. Please, don't forget to call me. All right, you can go back to sleep. Tyler? What the hell. All right, um. I'm filming this video for all my fans, my viewers, my clients. I don't know what happened last night, I was sleeping, but I watched the footage and. There was definitely somebody in the house, somebody, it looks like they came from the attic, which would explain the noises I've been hearing. Shy's freaked out. She's traumatized so we're gonna head to the police station and see if they can come out and check it out for us. See if there's anything we can do to prevent it from happening again. But, uh. Shy still thinks I'm filming for her. She thinks I'm filming for her mom. But... Something weird is going on. I've gotta film it. Let's go. You ready? Come on. Did you call your Mom? I'm not calling my Mom. I don't wanna freak her out. Okay. You okay? Just know that everything's okay, everything's fine. There's nothing, nothing bad's gonna happen. We're gonna get to the police station. They're gonna come check it out for us. Travis, you don't understand. What do I not understand? My mom is going to be so disappointed in me. She's gonna be so disappointed in me! How disappointed, what? Someone is there! Someone is there and they're creeping on us! - They're watching us. - They're gone. Why is the camera even still on, Travis? I'm not showing this to my mom. It does not need to be on. I'm serious. Dude, you're getting all mad and I'm just trying to get some action, man. No, Travis. Action, what do you mean? - I'm just... - I do not wanna risk this. Turn the camera off. - They don't... - Risk what, why? Risk them helping us, risk them catching the guy. Please, just turn the camera off. So they're gonna come check everything out. Make sure everything's okay. Yeah. See, there you go, I told you. Everything will be okay. All right, officer, thank you, mm-hmm. This is it? That's all I get. Technically, there really is nothing they can do until we have a little bit more evidence for them. That's all the evidence we have! That's all the evidence we should need! I mean, it was a black shadow. They can't look for anybody. What are they gonna do? Send policemen to guard your house? That'd be nice. I don't know, Shy. Okay, so, what you have here is an H3, which is one of our older models. Now, I can upgrade it for you. It's gonna run, I would say, about $7500 if you wanna do that. It does include windows, even if they're... I just want you to take care of my daughter. - Okay. - That's it. Okay, well, I can promise you that when you arm both doors, the front and the back, that an alarm will go off if they're messed with. Want me to just do that then? - Fine. - Okay. Come here, let me just talk to your for a minute, okay? No, I'm not coming home. - I told you... - No! this was gonna happen. You say that all the time! You seriously cannot let me go! I'm done taking care of you, you're done taking care of me! - Shy. - And you need to go! Now. Cheyenne. I'm so sorry, sir. It's okay. Shy. What are you doing? It's three in the morning. Come on, let's go to bed. Look, I really think we should go to your mom's. You're really testing me right now. Shy, you can't even sleep here. You're traumatized. Come on, don't do it for her. You and Sam will head over there. We'll just sleep there for a night and then come back. Sam. You okay? Yeah. I just don't wanna deal with it. I don't wanna deal with her mom. What are you talking about? I don't wanna go over there with you. It's not you guys, I just. You feel safe staying here? Yeah. Okay, I thought you'd say that. Well, here. Take this, okay? Okay. If anything happens, turn it on, record everything for evidence, okay? All right. You sure you're gonna be okay? Yeah, I'll be fine. Probably gonna go to sleep anyways. All right, if you need anything just let me know, okay? All right. Sam. - Yeah? - Be careful. You too. Shy? Don't talk to me. Shy. What, I'm not here for you. She's just really tired right now. She just needs to get some sleep, that's really all. I barely got her over here so. She just needs to be alone. Well, then maybe you should put the camera away. I'm taking those pills because of you! It's the only way I can calm myself down! Okay, no, no, no, no, no, that's ridiculous! You stopped for a reason and you're gonna go back to them because I left, because I grew up? That is out of line! You have no idea what I am going through! You left me by myself! I understand that, but it's because I'm growing up and you have to understand that 21 year olds don't stay home with their mothers to take care of them! Well, some of them do, some of them should! You should! - What do you want me to do? - Just stop yelling at me right now. How can I get this across to you? I'm going to bed. Shy, just breathe. Get that camera offa me, Travis! You okay? Travis, the camera again, seriously? Um, what? Turn it off. - Why, what's the matter? - I'm tired of it. You need to go to sleep, you need Tyler. Why don't you call Tyler and see if he can come over and y'all can get a little cuddle session? I won't bother y'all. Hello? Travis? Shy? Your mom has a lotta heels. Like a lotta heels. He didn't answer. Well, where is he? I don't know. Hey, have you heard from Sam? No. Okay, well, let's hurry and get over to the house so we can just make sure she's okay. 'Cause I can't get a hold of her. Okay, whatever. Shy! What if whoever killed Stacy and John is out to get us too? If that was the case, I would've never moved out here in the first place. Please don't, I really don't wanna talk about it. Shy, I'm just saying. Maybe your mom was right about something. My mom was right? Are you serious? Out of all people, my mom? - Okay, sorry. - No, no. - You know what? - Shy, what are you doing? How does it feel? How does it feel to be - on the camera 24/7? - Shy, that's expensive equipment, you can't just - play with it. - I don't care! You're not going anywhere, Travis. How does it feel to be on the camera? - Shy, seriously? - How does it feel? How does it feel to be on it 24/7, how? How do you like it? You know what, Travis, I've been on the camera too damn long and I've told you too many times not to put me on and you have yet to listen! Shy, you wanted this. No, you know what? I'm done with your fucking camera. You can have your expensive equipment. It's bullshit. Sam! Sam! Shy, call her again. I am, it keeps going to voicemail. Hey, hey, just relax. You're assuming the worst. Travis, she always has on her phone on her. Hey, hey, look at me. We shouldn't have left her alone. Shy, she probably went to her mom's. She probably got a little freaked out. She always has her phone on her. You know that, Travis. Look, there's something I need to talk to you about. Okay, what I'm going to tell you, I just need you to understand and remember that I'm your best friend, and I'm doing this because I care about you, okay? And I care about Sam, and I need to make sure that y'all are safe. Okay. Remember when you asked me, you asked me what Sam was talking about that night on the porch? Yes. Well, I wasn't fully honest with you. You know, she told me someone was following her, that someone was watching her sleep, that she wasn't comfortable, and she did tell me who she thought that person was. Which is who? Well. I didn't believe her and then it started happening to me, and it's making sense. Which is who? Tyler. My boyfriend Tyler? Yes, yes, but, Shy, Shy, before you get mad and before you yell and start screaming, just hear me out, okay, let me explain. Look at him. He has a criminal background, he's tatted, he's quiet. You don't really know him. And neither do you. I don't know him and that's why I'm saying that something isn't right. Travis, you're supposed to be my best friend. Okay, I am, what, I am your best friend. That's why I'm telling you this. And you think that boyfriend who I choose to be the love of my life would do that? - Yes. - Would creep on Sam out of all people? That's ridiculous. - It's not ridiculous. - Completely ridiculous! - Shy. - Out of all. Not only that, Travis, out of all days you choose today knowing that I've been through hell and back to tell me this. Shy, Sam's missing. When else would I tell you this? And get this camera - out of my face. - Shy, I'm your best friend. I'm done with this camera. My gosh. Shy, Shy, Shy! I don't care if you're tired. Why were you in the attic? Why were you in the attic? You need to lower your voice. You need to lower your voice. No. You don't talk to me like that. You're asking the same thing - over and over again. - Because I wanna know why were you in the attic. - Shy, you good? - Put the camera down. - Put the camera down, why? - Travis, put the camera down. Why were you in the attic? Dude, just get to the point? Where's Sam? Oh, now you're comin' at me? You're comin' at me? Yes, where's our friend? - Where's Sam? - You think I'm stalking Sam? Yes, I do or I wouldn't ask. - You think I'm the one? - Tyler, stop avoiding the question, why were you in the attic? Babe, I was in the attic for you! I'm trying to see who's stalking my girlfriend! I'm trying to protect you! I'm tired of this shit, man. No, stop, Tyler, you don't have to. Tyler, what are you doing? - Stop, please, please! - Tyler. Cheyenne, just stay there. Just stay there, Cheyenne, don't move! Cheyenne, stay there! Tyler, be careful. Shy, stay there. Shy, don't move! Travis, let's go! Shh, Shy, just hold on a second. Guys, there's no one over here. Tyler, Tyler! Run, Shy, run, run! Run, Shy! Shit, go! - Okay, all right. - Go, get in! Get in, get in! - Just drive, drive! - It's really dark. All right, let's go, let's go, let's go. He's dead, he's dead, he's dead. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Shy. I know, I know, I know. I know, but we gotta go. Call the police, call the police. No! Shy, give me the phone, give me the phone, hello? Yes, yes, uh. Someone was at our house. We went up to the police station a few days ago. Tyler Johnson, he was just murdered. I need you to send someone to this address. Travis, someone is following us! Just go, just speed up, Cheyenne! Lose him! I don't know what to do, Travis. Just lose him, just lose him, you're okay, you're okay. And you keep the camera rolling this whole time, do you hear what I'm saying? Okay. You keep the camera on the whole time. Please, we're not going to the police station. We need to go to Shy's mom's house to make sure she's okay! You're fine, you're fine. You just gotta speed up, take lots of turns. No, keep going, keep going, keep going. We're almost there. - Good. - Okay, okay. Good, you lost him, you lost him, you lost him. Let's go! Shy! Mom! Mom! Mom? Hold the camera. Look, it's Sam's camera. Sam? Travis, call her. Nothing. What? It's just her phone. Bitch! Run, run! Oh my God, oh my God, Travis! Stay in here. What is it? Oh my God! What? No, no, no! I did what you wanted me to do! I'm so done! Shy, run! Oh my God. Shy. Mom? Shy. I did all this for you. And now we can be together. - All right. - Shy. Okay. I love you, Shy. I'm so sorry. - I'm sorry I left you. - It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I love you. Oh, Mommy! Sorry. It's been a while since I reached out. For those who don't know me, I'm Cheyenne Martinson. And a month ago, I lost everything. I lost my best friend. I lost my roommate. I lost my boyfriend. And I lost my mom. My dog was found in my mom's closet. I never knew I could be so lonely. I tried to start fresh, buy this new apartment, but I'm still alone. But I'm okay, I'm alive. And I'm still smiling. And I made this video for victims of stalking. People who have lost anybody close to them. Friends, family. We're not alone. Regardless of the situation, you still wake up every morning, you still get ready for work, and you still live your life. You can't dwell on the past. Who the hell did this?
