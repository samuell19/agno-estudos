I owe you five. Oh, keep your money, bud. One of these days you'll learn. Never doubt your uncle or question good old redneck ingenuity. Maybe you should run for office. Are we talking presidential, or principal's office? Just don't screw this up. Entire park's counting on us to get 'em off the grid. It's like you said, ain't gonna survive with DeConnard squeezing every last dime for basic living needs. Well, if this works, it'll be one heck of a bill they can scratch off the list. And speaking of scratch off, I am feeling lucky today. That storm's hunkering down fast. I don't want you to get your goose cooked while you're under there. No, it's safe. The line won't go hot till that windmill picks up a pretty good clip. Sure you know what you're doing? Electricity and water, they don't mix too well. You just hand me a ice cold beer when I get back. You hear me? Now let's go plug it in, get it fired up. All right. Holy hellfire. Uncle Jeff. All right, stop. I'm in a crappier spot than a port-a-potty at a Mardi Gras parade. Look, I don't mean to burn that image into your head, but I just want to convey to you how deep in dung I am at this moment. All right. Let's back up. - That dog bit me right here! - Were you drunk again? If you don't stop hittin' this like a girl-- Where's the fight? Hey, Wyatt! That's my money! Go, Jack, go! Hey! You trying to ruin my hair? I'm gonna get my gun. You know I will, I will take you out! It all started with this man, Malcolm DeConnard, the richest, meanest bastard I know. He owns everything that you've seen so far, and he shakes us down on the regular for all that we got. But he's about to find out we got a little fight left in us. Get him, Rufus. Oh hey there, sugar britches. Hey, Roxie. Hey, you know my washer's still broke, and if you fix it for me, I'd make it worth your while. Listen, I told you, I'm with Jolene. I mean I can make it worth her while or y'all's while. All right, we'll see. No. Well, ask her about it. Hey, Sapphire. Bird. What's up, Rob? Hey Rob. You two at it again? Yeah, we could always use another hand. He's not my real brother though. I told you I'd get her up and running. It's private time, Rob! Hey, Rob, it is private time! Go on, get! - Cleon! - Hey, Rob! I got two racks of ribs. Coming over later? I wouldn't miss it. All right, buddy. Damn. That smells good. You already know, buddy. Got that sauce going. - Hey, Symphony. - Hey, Rob. Y'all quit messing with that dog. I wasn't! I wasn't! Cappy. Nearly got that thing patched up? Yeah, just about ready to tie her up and get her wet. All right, you keep working it. I know, I'm late. Your uncle's already been by twice. He mad? He was sweaty and cursing. Well that don't tell me much, now does it? Had a job fall in my lap. Couldn't pass it up. $100 closer to a new life. Give me the money! Get off her! - I need more time. - Get off her, you jerk! I know, it's the saddest thing I've ever heard. Let go of the purse. Damn. Get him off of me. - Get off her! - I just need more time! Get off of her! Get off of her! Stop. No! Everything all right? This ain't none of your business now, is it? How much she need? 250. You got your money. You can go now. Look at you, all fired up. Guess every junkyard needs a guard dog, huh? Hey, for 250, I'll fix that for ya. 350. It's just been a really hard month, Rob. I just need more time. It's all right. Well, look who decided to finally show up. Had some things to take care of. Chet had some work for me over at the shop. I got some work for you right here. Yeah, but he pays me. I pay you too. I can't buy a house with beer. You got a house. - Trailer ain't a house. - Hmm. Got a roof over your head, don't you? Got a kitchen to eat, bed to fornicate. Name one thing a house has that a trailer won't offer. Basement. A basement. Touche. I ain't gonna live in the park my whole life. Well, it ain't where are you are that matters. It's what you are. You like that, don't ya? I can tell. On the bottom of my bottle cap. Real wise, them little suckers. Sure enough, let's go to work. I can't get over that. I oughta write that down. Come on, boy! Come on! I can go all day, Wyatt, let's do it! What the hell's going on out here? Y'all like to fight? I'll whoop both your behinds and put a cherry on top. This here is horse dung, Rufus. Well he started it, Barb. No, I mean what I just stepped in, from your horse. - Well that I do apologize for. Now now, y'all, come on! We're all neighbors! We must speak of love and kindness as the good Lord instructed us. Well, will the Lord kindly instruct this jerknut to pay his child support? Come on, Barb, you know that's not even my baby. It was only one night. You son of a bitch, it was magical! Oh, hell no! I'll teach you to bear trap my man with your coo-coo! It's a little too late for that, you drunk fish. At least I don't go around letting everybody tongue punch my fart box. That was one time! What's this fight about? Oh, nothin'. Just dealing with Barb, crotch-baiting men again. Hey, you don't know me. Money's been hard with DeConnard gouging us. I even tried to go back to table dancing. Well, Rob and his Uncle Jeff are working on getting a line to that windmill. Get us some good old free electricity. Should help us all out a little. Well how's he gonna do that? Something about running a line under the water all the way up to the trailer park and overriding that transformer. All MacGyver-like! - If you think that DeConnard's gonna let your rebound boyfriend swipe some free electricity off of that windmill, you're dumber than I look. Shut up. You think he can actually do it? I know they can. When Rob and I first started dating, he fixed the air conditioner in my car. This here park's energy will be off the grid and as green as the cash we'll all be saving. Them two short bus regulars can barely tap a keg, let alone an entire power supply. Amen. Rufus, what's that? Hey! Give me my hat! Y'all, knock it off already! - That cable ain't long enough. It damn sure ain't gonna reach the connecting line. I bet you five bucks it'll stretch a whole lot further than you think it will. I know what I'm doing, Rob. I didn't just fall off a turnip truck. ♪ Down to the bayou ♪ That new turbine the county built is practically begging us to tap into the kinetic energy and power up Soggy Meadows. Whoa, kinetic. That's a big word. Well, you know what they say about a man and his big words. He's compensating for the size of his cable? Yeah. Boss. I don't think you should be smoking that close to this much ammonium nitrate. This fertilizer bomb goes off, it's gonna make a crater the size of Cleveland. Well just make it powerful enough to obliterate the entire van, 'cause we can't have a shred of evidence linking us back to it. - I still don't see how blowing that levee's gonna be easier than just telling all them chillbillies to get off your lot. Because all those low-lifes have rights by law, whether they pay the rent or not. They could squat that land for a year before I could get the cops to do anything about 'em, and I ain't gonna wait no year. You know my ex still lives over there, ya? Well not for long, 'cause when that levee breaks and that water floods in, only thing that's gonna be living there are my drills. That wasteland is just ripe for the picking. Listen, when that storm rolls in, people gonna run around scared like crazy, and when that storm rolls out, it's gonna look like a natural disaster. In a few weeks, everybody's gonna forget what Soggy Meadows ever was. ♪ Rooster crows, six o'clock ♪ Yep, here come the clouds. Right on cue. Weatherman finally got something right for a change. Why are you driving like an idiot? If this thing goes off, we're gonna make one hell of a meat cloud. It'll only go off with the timer. But once we set it, it ain't meant to be turned off, so.

I owe you five. Oh, keep your money, bud. One of these days you'll learn, never doubt your uncle or question good old redneck ingenuity. Hey. You know, maybe we should just wait and let it hit the fan. You crazy? I'm not getting stuck in this mud when that storm hits. I'm setting it now. What should I set it for? Depends on how fast you can run. Faster than your ass! Now how long? Hell, I don't know. Four minutes. You got it? Set, go! Aww hell! The license plate. I said leave no trace. Son of a bitch! Idiot! Go get it. No. If that van traces back to DeConnard, take a wild guess what's gonna happen to you. Now go get it. - Hurry up. - Shut up! Let's go! Stop. Stop talking. Nah, it's safe. That line won't go hot 'til that windmill picks up a pretty good clip. Sure you know what you're doing? You just have me an ice cold beer when I get back, you hear me? Get fired up. Hurry up, man! Shut up. I got it! Uncle Jeff. Uncle Jeff? Help! Help! Hello? Help! Hey man, are you with me? Take a breath. What happened? Did I blow a cable? Or something? It wasn't you. The levee got blasted. On purpose, by the looks of it. Who in their right mind would do something like that? I saw someone running away from it. I could've swore-- What the hell? We gotta get you outta the water! What is it? Help! No! Uncle Jeff! Daisy! Daisy! Help, Rufus! Rufus, help! I'm stuck! Jolene? I'm stuck, I'm inside my trailer! Rufus! You hold tight now. I need a rope or something. Come on, Duke! Come on, boy! Come on! Grab the rope! All right, climb to the top of the roof now! I'm gonna pull now! I'm out! Thank you. I gotta find Daisy. What? Rufus, Shark! Look out, 12:00! No, no, six. Six! Uh, nine? Hey, no, no, over there. It's you and I, Duke. You and I. Oh. Oh, no! My Duke! Not my Duke! Duke, Duke... No, Duke. Rufus, it's your turn to climb, I gotcha. Grab the rope. He ate my Duke. Hey, look at me. Look at me! You saved my life, you and Duke, you saved my life. Okay, look at me, look at me. You're a hero, Rufus. Focus on that. You saved my life. Gene Autry woulda been proud, huh? That's right, she really woulda. Help! Help me! I gotta get outta here, Lord. You can't kill me! I'm one of the good ones! You can take the rest, just don't take me! We heard that, ya jerk. Praise the Lord! Help me, y'all! Help me get outta here! Try to climb on your roof through the vent! I can't fit! Try using your front door, then! Rufus, you know I ain't got no door. Hold tight, Cleon. Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! You said, "You can take the rest, just don't take me." Thanks a lot, buddy. Some holy roller you turned out to be. Come on now. You know I didn't mean it. Staring death straight in the face does strange things to a man! Please don't take it personally. Where's everyone else at? Their trailers! They're all gone! They washed away. And Dukey? She's gone. - Oh, Lord! - No, no, they're here. Somewhere. Yeah, you have to have faith. Oh, I got faith. Hey! Hey! Lots of people are dead! Who? Like that hot mess. What about Jolene? Probably. The whole of Soggy Meadows is underwater. Well yeah, the levee got destroyed. Ya think? - I gotta get back to the park. Well get in! Come on! Look at them arms, damn. Mm. How is that possible? How did that thing survive? I hit it with like 10,000 volts, I thought for sure it was fried. You ever heard of an electric eel? Yeah? You ever tried my eel sauce? What? Oh, yes sir. Them electric eels are seven feet long. Five times the charge of a three pronged wall socket. Dirty as hell. Well how much charge do you think a 20 foot shark got? Enough to jumpstart your trunk. That's for sure. That's a damn shame. Fire! Rat bastard! Go out, shoo! Come on, come on, come get me! - I'm coming! - Come on! Come on! Come on! Use that muscle! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Jump! Now! There goes our ride. Sorry, Rob. I'm just glad you're okay. That was-- Cappy? Y'all, this ain't working, they're really stuck under there. Well then pull harder on it. If I had a dollar for every time I heard Rufus say that. This damn roof is slipperier than that one summer in Panama City. I'm so glad I grabbed you instead of Grandma's pearls. She would not want me to be sober through all this nonsense. Look, why don't you just go over to Daisy's trailer and help her pull? - I'm not getting on any trailer with that dirty liberal. - Am not. - Bitches. How in the world did this happen? Global warming. - Let's swim for it. - Are you kidding me? I'm not dangling a single toe into that water where the gators and the moccasins get to 'em. Nope. Nobody invited you, you dingle-berry, I wasn't even talking to you. Well y'all go ahead, I hope you drown. I'm sure somebody will be by soon to rescue me. Will they? Come on. I can't go anywhere 'til we find Buck Vegas. Damn dog was next to me one second and gone the next. Bucky's a smart pup. I'm sure he's high and dry somewhere. Animals have sort of a sixth sense for that kind of thing, you know? You're right. When that giant tsunami wave thing hit over in Mayonnaisia, all the animals were already long gone. High-tailed it to the nearest hills. All right. He's probably chilling safe somewhere. It's Malaysia, by the way. Bucky! I'm gonna kill whoever did this. We blew it, just like you wanted. Water rushed right into your property. Nicely done. But there, there's was one minor issue. We lost Bruno in the process. He blew up with the van. - Blew up? - Uh huh. Completely? Or are there little parts of him floating around so somebody can identify him as an employee of mine? Oh no. He pretty much vaporized on the spot. Good. But, there is one little problem. I-- - Out with it, dammit! I think somebody saw me. That piece of ash trash who's dating my Jolene. He rode up on his wave runner when the levee blew. Oh. Is that right? A witness. Well that's that small little problem you probably should have mentioned earlier. I'm gonna tell you a story you probably never heard. I used to have three partners, once upon a time. Let's just call 'em Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Now, they thought it'd be a swell idea to go behind my back and acquire majority shares of the company that we started. It was a textile company, delivering animal hides to clothing stores all over the world. Like alligator, snake, ostrich, for purses and shoes and so on. I didn't like taking a financial hit like that, so I fixed it. Like I always do. Like I asked you to do. Whoa, whoa, boss. - You fixed it so some low-life trailer park runny meat sack could point at my furry little ass and put me in jail for the rest of my life. No, sir. From where I'm sitting, my perspective is you might have some more work to do. I understand. And when are you gonna do it? Right now. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'm putting out a contract on that witness of yours, and I'm hiring you to execute it, or him. Man up and kill somebody! Or I'll do it. Am I clear? Crystalline, yes, sir. Hey, boss? Those three business partners of yours, the ones you was telling me about. Whatever happened to them? Come here. Let's just say I put 'em to better use. I'll fix it. Just perfect. As if there wasn't enough going on. Dammit, how am I gonna... Yeah, that was dumb. Right. Ah! Gold old redneck ingenuity. My Uncle Jeff would be proud. I think. Bucky! Bucky! Bucky! What are you doing? It's for when the rescue planes fly overhead. What the hell is a SOT? Save our trailer. Bucky? It's the Buck-meister! Look at him Snoopy-ing it up. Man that boy's good. I'm gonna get him. How exactly you plan on doing that, huh? I don't know, swim? I just seen a tail or something slipping between the trees over there, I gotta save him. Bucky, you son of a bitch, just hold on, I'm coming. Y'all just keep an eye out for snakes or gators and holler loud as hell if you see one. We best be praying the Coast Guard gets here soon. Whoa. - Look. - No way. - Wyatt, hurry up, bro, a shark! Oh, hell no. Bucky! I'm coming, dude! Bucky! Hurry! It's gonna get you, don't stop! Hurry, faster! - Swim! - Ow, darn it. Why'd he stop? Wyatt, what's wrong? You got a cramp or something, honey? I think he's in shock. You gotta get outta the water. Bucky! Just a little bit more. You got it! Darn it. ♪ You know you such a ho ♪ ♪ You know ♪ ♪ You know you such a ho ♪ Is this real life? Oh, I just got shocked real bad. We must be on top of that underwater power line. Wyatt, snap out of it.

One minute I be watching Showcase Showdown, and the next thing I know I been swept here by the water. Everyone okay? You seen what happened to Jo? I haven't seen a soul since things got biblical. I'm just sitting here catching whatever comes my way. Look. One man's tragedy is another man's treasure. That looks real nice. Hey, that's my watch. You want it? Yeah. 20 bucks. My grandpa gave me that watch before he died. Ah, so it's something real special to you. Yeah, sure is. 50. - All right, I'll tell you what. How about I don't make any fuss about the watch if you lend me that oar. What do you say? For old time's sake? You got yourself a deal. It's a pleasure doing business with you. Hey, I'm gonna go down to the park, see if anyone needs any help. You wanna come? Nah. This is like Christmas. All right, you be safe, you hear? There's a shark swimming in these waters. A shark here? The weatherman said nothing about a tornado. How much for that gun? This one? Whoa whoa whoa! Whiskey tango foxtrot, don't point that thing at me, I said I wasn't gonna make no fuss. Come on now. I'm just funnin' with ya. Here. You can have it. Thank you, Billie Jean. You be safe. Bye. ♪ La la la la la la la ♪ You keep on rowing. Go save those people. Woo hoo, baby! Look at this place, Curls, it's all washed up. Genius this one, boss. This needs to be the end of this trailer park. - Understood? - Yes sir. And if we find anyone left alive, fix 'em. Unless it's my ex. I got special plans for her. And if that's bitch boy she tried to replace me with, I got even special-er plans for him. Ooh, I like that. Yes sirree! Woo! Come on now. Jo! Rob? Oh, thank God. Woo hoo! Yeah! - He's alive! - Hey, partner! Sweet Jesus, he's come to save us, y'all. Woo! Are you all right? I am now. Aren't you a sight for sore eyes. I thought maybe the flood washed you away or something worse. Oh yeah yeah yeah, some of us were. Have you found any others? You know, what about Daisy, you seen her? No man. Sorry. Come a little closer, I'm gonna jump down and give you the kiss of a lifetime. You hold that thought, darling. There's a shark in these waters and that son of a bitch is pissed off. Yeah, we believe it. And we seen it. He ate my Dukey. And my Uncle Jeff, too. But he ain't no run of the mill shark. It's got issues, electrical ones. Look, I don't think my boat's big enough for all four of us, I think it's best if we just stay up here on top of these trailers, wait for some choppers to come rescue us. I mean, do they even know this is going on? Right? I mean all the power lines are down and I guarantee it nobody's paid their damn cell phone bills this month. We ain't seen a single rescue team. No boat, no plane, nothing. It's like they don't even know the levee broke. Oh, it wasn't broke. - It was blowed up. - What? By who? Golden Bullet, come in. Golden Bullet, come in. This is Golden Bullet. What do you have? It's wiped out here. Good. No sign of any surviving tenants. I've never seen anything like this. Just make sure my cleanup operation can start right away. Copy that. Hey, I'll come by later on the boat and survey that damage. Echo One out. Jackpot. Dammit. Holy grits. Come and get it! You're the next contestant on the Price is Right! Woo! Woo hoo hoo, baby! Woo hoo hoo, baby! - Well well, what have we here? The lone survivor. Where are the others, Daisy? I don't know. Get me the hell off of this thing. Why, so I could take you up to the bar and you can drink all my beer? Nah, I'm all good on that. Where's the others, bitch? Dead. They're all dead. Even Jolene? I don't know what happened to Jolene. We got separated when the wave came through. Who's all dead? Barb and Wyatt at least. There's a great white coming through here, if you haven't noticed, got 'em both. Shark in the park? That's a first. Now get me the hell outta here, and onto dry land. Just not to a dry county. You heard her boys. Let's get her off of there, huh? Open wide, bitch! Swayze! What the hell happened to you? You used to be one of us. I took some advice. I got outta that low-life country club. You shoulda done the same while you still had a chance, Daisy Cakes. Been real nice knowing ya. Aww, did we get you wet, Daisy Cakes? Make sure she doesn't make it back to dry land. Of any county. Have fun! I saw Swayze walking away after the explosion. In fact, I caught him on camera. That son of a bitch did this. That makes sense. Swayze's been doing DeConnard's dirty work. I'll kill him when I see him! Of course DeConnard's behind all this. Why wouldn't he be? He's been wanting us off his land for years. Look like he finally got his wish, huh? Oh wait man. You say you got Swayze on camera, right? Well, where's the footage? In the belly of that shark. But he ate my Go-Pro, and my ska-do. That's a good thing, though. But I love that ska-do! Oh no, no, the camera's in a waterproof casing, you see? You see sharks have a slow digestive tract. Don't ask me why I know that, but it's still there, right? You kill the fish, retrieve the camera, and not only do we get revenge on the shark, we get revenge on DeConnard as well. Yeah. We'll put that no good, butt-packing, silly slapping, deep digging trailer swamping Soggy Meadows son of a motherless goat away for good. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, are you out actually suggesting we give a great white a reverse colonoscopy?

Listen, I just got some news that the levee around my trailer property had some severe damage and there's some floodin' in the area. So, I'm thinkin' that the people in that region, they're gonna be needin' food and supplies and whatnot.

And gas too? Yes, and gas too. Listen, this is supply meets demand, Sally. Supply meets demand. Golden Bullet, come in! Ya? What do you have? Survivors. Survivors? And a shark, apparently. And a shark? Must've washed in from the ocean. They said they got video proof of me at the scene, destroying the levee. Video? Listen up, you need to get that video and take care of it. He said the shark at the damn camera. Well, good. Then it's already taken care of. Well, they plan to hunt the shark and retrieve it. They seem pretty determined to take us down. Retrieve it? Listen to me. No one leaves this thing alive. No fish or human. That includes your little girlfriend, too. Am I clear? I have it covered. Covered, my ass. Bitch-ass amateurs. Need someone killed, you do it your damn self. How we gonna go about huntin' a great white shark? I mean, we have a rubber raft, three drowned trailers, and duct tape. - Duct tape? - Duct tape! I like duct tape. Ya, me too. But how do we go about achieving that level of win? You catch a shark like you would any other fish, partner. With bait. Okay. How we gonna go about gettin' bait in the middle of a damn crisis? I don't know. I got a big bloody rib marinatin' in my refrigerator. Would that work? You say bloody? Bloody, baby! Hell, yeah! Now we're cookin'! But how you gonna go about hookin' it? Well... You got duct tape. That's a good point. With the winch hitch off my old skiff. Yeah, somehow, we get that damn thing to lock a bite off of that hook. Tie it off to some chain and wrap it around Daisy's beer kegs. That'll tire him out real quick. Yeah? Just like them yellow barrels that Quint done used. That's not a bad idea. Slows him down, tires him out. He can't keep on swimmin', then he can't breathe. You count me in. This is for the big brown Dukey! For your Dukey. I gotcha, I gotcha. Come on, yeah. All right, all right. You know, if this is gonna work, these things are gonna have to be drained.

I don't know what the hell I was thinkin'. If the good Lord wanted me to go back down in that murky death trap, he probably woulda blessed me with a nice set of gills. You see any rescue teams comin' to save us? No. Heard any choppers? No! Then I reckon we're gonna have to be our own heroes, which faithfully includes you. So get the meat. I hate to see a good rack of ribs go to waste. Ain't no waste. That rack of ribs gonna save our damn lives. And when we get that fish, we're gonna filet us up some shark steaks. How about that? Does shark go good with mustard and relish? You're damn right it does! Now buck up, Cleon! I'm goin' in! I'm in! Oh, man. Everything is ruined. It's a damn shame. Oh, man. Um, you're not doin' what I think you're doin'. Yeah. I'm goin' in, darlin'. Gotta untie my winch hitch - and get some chains. - Goodness gracious, Rufie. - Please be careful. - I will. Ya, I got her. No I don't! That coulda been more graceful. Hittin' the gas straight off the tank, huh, baby? We need you sharp to pull this off now. Don't forget to save some for the rest of us. Huh.

I'm right here, man. I'm right here! Hey, we gotta get outta here. That shark is still hungry, man. Where's Cleon with the meat? - Well the ribs are right there. I don't think Cleon made it, man. - Oh, no! - And neither will we unless we get back up on that trailer. Come on. Rufus! Aw, come back here man, we need you! This was your plan! Rufie, no! Damn it! Yee-haw! I'm skiin' behind my shark, Dukey! Yee-haw! John Wayne never did this! Eat your heart out, Eastwood! Yee-haw! You tell him I'm comin', Dukey, and hell's comin' with me. You hear? And hell's comin' with me! You gotta get out of that boat! That thing's gonna kill you too! I'm not gonna let them die in vain. But if you die, that's it, game over. Get out of the water now! I got this. Don't you dare get yourself killed, do you hear me? I love you, Rob. I love you too, darlin'. That's why I'm doing this. It worked! Chew on that, you bastard! It worked! I can't believe it worked. You hooked that son of a bitch. Good old redneck ingenuity. I think I peed a little bit though. Kinda warm. Daisy Cakes. Still need a ride? Get on. It ain't a request. Rob, you gotta get out of there! He's comin' back around. Where are you going? I don't know! He's coming for ya! You gotta climb, baby! Rob, watch out! Dammit, Rob! - Did you see that? - Pretty hard not to. No, the chain. What about it? All right, watch this. What in the hell are you doin', Rob? I'm going fishing. He's comin' again. - I want him to. - Are you crazy? Or just stupid. It's a fine line. For trailer park and country! Yes! It worked! You're a genius. Or just lucky. It's a fine line. Rob! Rob! Well. Look what we have here. I think it's time to take out the trailer trash. You heartless bastard! You're getting everyone killed, for what? Money? What can I say? It's a shark-eat-shark world, sweet tea. But you and your kind, you are nothin' but a waste o' life. You are one step away from being on the street. And you expectin' me to pay for your room and board? Not anymore. You know, I would love to kill you myself, but I have a better idea. I'd rather watch that shark eat you. Start paddlin'! Paddle! Go! Paddle! Paddle! Come on now. Paddle! Paddle! Paddle! Keep paddlin'! Kick those little feet, darlin'. Don't make me use this. You're gettin' warm. Almost there. Atta girl. You're finished. Man, they're gonna love you in prison. Rob, help! Stay down, you dumb-ass hillbilly! You're right where you belong, 'cause all you're ever gonna be is a no-good, worthless trailer rat. You shoulda come work for me when you had the chance. I'd have gotten you out of this dump. It's not where you are that matters, it's what you are. And right now, I'm the one with the gun. You ain't gonna shoot me. You wanna bet? Well, once again, it seems the tide has turned in my favor. You had to go get my man on video blowin' the place up, didn't you? And somehow the shark eats it? I don't know who I'm gonna enjoy killin' more, that shark or both of you. How 'bout I get you mounted. I'll hang you up over the fireplace. What do you think about-- Hey! Hey! What? He deserved that. That's one fickle tide. Uh oh. - Oh, no. - Let's get out of here! What are you waiting for? Go! Well, I have an idea. You're really gonna double-down now? We leave and he gets loose of that line, what he does to other folks is gonna be on us. Ah, hell. Why don't you grab that rope, okay? You lasso that chum guzzler. We'll drag him up onto dry land. We'll watch him suffocate, slowly. And then we'll get the Go-Pro. Why? DeConnard is dead. Well, people still need to know what he did. All right, all right. If there's one thing I learned from Rufus, it's how to swing a rope. When he teach you that? Got it! Woo, come on! Hit it! - Yippee ki-yay, futher mucker. Hell ya! You're doin' it! Ya, we're doin' it. We're not doin' it. Givin' it all she got! Look out! The cleat's not gonna hold! Duck! Watch out! I'm gonna keep us drier than a popcorn fart. No friggin' way. You're the luckiest son of a bitch I know! Luck ain't got nothing to do with it. My Go-Pro! - Son of a bitch! - Dammit! Hey! You let her go! Daisy? I'm okay. She's okay. Well, that's one way to get rid of an old boyfriend. Can you move? Uh huh. I'm gonna get my Go-Pro. I got it! Woo! Ya, baby! And that, ladies and gents, is how I learned to stop worrying and love the trailer park. It might not look like much, but it's everything to us. It's home. Well, to what's left of us.
