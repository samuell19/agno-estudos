ENOUGH ALREADY! I'VE HEARD JASON PRIESTLEY ONLY CARES ABOUT ONE THING... VOLUME. IT'S NOT GONNA MATTER. I'M SURE HE'S DATING JENNIE GARTH OR SHANNON DOHERTY. STAR MAGAZINE SAID HE WAS SINGLE! MY MOM READS STAR. YOU WANT REAL NEWS, WATCH HARD COPY. EVERYBODY KNOWS ACTORS TOTALLY HOOK UP WITH EACH OTHER WHEN THEY'RE ON THESE SHOWS. MM-MM. NOT TORI SPELLING. APPARENTLY, SHE'S A VIRGIN. SHYEAH! ONLY ON THE SHOW. HI, TORI. WE LOVE YOU ON 90210. IS THIS ON? SO IT IS. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, FOR COMING OUT TONIGHT TO CELEBRATE THE MASSIVE SUCCESS OF BEVERLY HILLS 90210! NOW I'D LIKE TO BRING UP THE MEN WHO MADE IT ALL POSSIBLE... MR. AARON SPELLING AND MR. DARREN STAR. THIS ONE RIGHT HERE! THIS IS THE MAN OF THE HOUR! THANK YOU, LARRY. TRUTH BE TOLD, I NEVER THOUGHT A SHOW ABOUT TEENAGERS WAS GOING TO WORK. IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM AS PLAUSIBLE AS A CRIME-FIGHTING TEAM COMPRISED OF ONLY HOT WOMEN. BUT IT NOT ONLY WORKED, OUR SECOND YEAR HAS BEEN EVEN BIGGER THAN OUR FIRST! AND I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE MAN WHO DESERVES THE MOST CREDIT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE CREATOR OF BEVERLY HILLS 90210, MR. DARREN STAR. WOW! BEFORE I GET STARTED, I WANT TO THANK THE PERSON WHO HAS TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT TELEVISION... MY PRODUCER, MY MENTOR, MY FRIEND... AARON SPELLING, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU DID IT ALL, KID. LARRY'S BEEN STALKING ME ALL NIGHT. I DON'T BLAME HIM! 90210 IS HOT. OF COURSE, HE WANTS A SPIN-OFF. BUT I DON'T WANT TO JUST DO A COLLEGE VERSION. I'VE BEEN THINKING IT SHOULD BE MORE LIKE ST. ELMO'S FIRE. YOU MEAN THAT MOVIE WITH ALL THE BRAT PACKERS? YEAH, "LIFE AFTER COLLEGE," WHEN EVERYTHING'S STARTING TO HAPPEN. 20-SOMETHINGS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO THEY ARE, WHAT THEY WANT FROM LIFE. I WANT A GROUP OF CHARACTERS FROM TOTALLY DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. FIRST, WE'LL START WITH A MOTORCYCLE-RIDING BAD-BOY FROM THE WRONG SIDE OF THE TRACKS... LIKE A HELL'S ANGEL? NO, UH... A "JAMES DEAN" TYPE, LIKE DYLAN, BUT OLDER. YOU KNOW? COOL OUTSIDER. MUCH BETTER. AND AN ALL-AMERICAN, GIRL-NEXT-DOOR TYPE... SOUNDS BORING. WELL... WHAT ABOUT AN INCREDIBLY GORGEOUS ALL-AMERICAN, GIRL-NEXT-DOOR TYPE? NOW YOU'RE TALKIN'. AND A STRUGGLING WRITER DESPERATE TO EXPERIENCE LIFE JUST SO HE HAS SOMETHING TO WRITE ABOUT. BUT HE'S NOT YOUR TYPICAL WRITER... HE'S ATHLETIC, HAS A SIX-PACK, GOES OUTSIDE OCCASIONALLY. NO OFFENSE. THE MAGIC OF TELEVISION. OF COURSE, WE'LL HAVE AN ATTRACTIVE CAST, JUST LIKE WE DO ON 90210... BUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT HERE IS THAT THESE CHARACTERS ARE OUT ON THEIR OWN, SOME FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. THERE'S NO FAMILY TO CATCH THEM WHEN THEY FALL, THEY ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER. ONE OF OUR CHARACTERS IS AN AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR. SHE'S FUN, SHE'S FRIENDLY, SHE'S ALWAYS IN EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS. WE'RE THINKING OF CASTING AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN FOR THAT ROLE. AND HER BEST FRIEND, A SOCIAL WORKER, WHO'S A LITTLE TOO NICE FOR HIS OWN GOOD AND HAPPENS TO BE GAY. "GAY" AS IN HOMOSEXUAL? NO, GAY AS IN "HAPPY-GO-LUCKY." YES! HOMOSEXUAL! THAT COULD BE RISKY. WHEN THIRTYSOMETHING SHOWED TWO GAY GUYS IN BED, ABC LOST A MILLION DOLLARS IN ADVERTISING, AND THEY WEREN'T EVEN TOUCHING, AARON. COME ON, LARRY! TIMES ARE CHANGING! 20 YEARS FROM NOW, BEING GAY IS GOING TO BE LIKE OWNING A STATION WAGON. LET'S JUMP ON IT WHILE IT'S STILL "NOW" AND "EDGY." HMM. OKAY, SO WE'VE FINALLY LOCKED "JAKE"... AFTER READING WHAT FELT LIKE A THOUSAND ACTORS. AND FOR "ALISON" WE HAVE IT NARROWED DOWN TO COURTNEY THORNE-SMITH AND COURTNEY COX, WHO YOU MAY REMEMBER FROM FAMILY TIES... DON'T FORGET "DANCING IN THE DARK" WITH BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN. LIKE I COULD FORGET? OKAY, WHAT ABOUT THE "BILLY" CHARACTER? WE HAD A LOT OF GOOD AUDITIONS... JASON BATEMAN, PAUL RUDD, STEPHEN DALE, MATTHEW PERRY. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS ALL WEEK, AND MY GUT SAYS... WE GO WITH DALE. ME TOO! HE'S CANADIAN, NOT REALLY KNOWN HERE, BUT IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A FRESH FACE. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, HE'S IN GREAT SHAPE, WHICH, JUDGING BY THE SCRIPT, HE'S GOING TO NEED. GRANT SHOW IS "JAKE"... OUR SENSITIVE BAD-BOY, WHO, AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE ALREADY INTRODUCED ON 90210... WE'LL HAVE KELLY FALL FOR HIM. IT'LL SET UP THE NEW WORLD, AND WHO DOESN'T LOVE THE IDEA OF A YOUNG GIRL WITH AN OLDER MAN? ON TELEVISION, OF COURSE. VANESSA WILLIAMS IS GOING TO PLAY OUR AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR. SHE'S A GREAT FIND. AMAZING ENERGY. HAVING HER IS GOING TO HELP EXPAND OUR AUDIENCE. THAT IS NOT VANESSA WILLIAMS. YOU'RE THINKING OF "MISS AMERICA" VANESSA WILLIAMS, SHE'S A SINGER. THIS IS VANESSA A. WILLIAMS, THE ACTRESS. HUH. SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE COULD BE "MISS AMERICA," TOO. I AGREE! THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CAST WE'VE EVER PUT TOGETHER. I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT 'EM TO ACT OR BREED. OR BOTH. WHOO-HOO! COURTNEY THORNE-SMITH WILL BE "ALISON," A GIRL FROM THE MID-WEST DETERMINED TO MAKE IT AS A CORPORATE EXECUTIVE. AND SHE'LL ENCOUNTER ALL THE TEMPTATIONS OF THE BIG CITY. DOUG SAVANT PLAYS "MATT," THE SOCIAL WORKER. IS HE STILL GAY? HE IS STILL GAY. - I DON'T KNOW... - WELL, WE COULD... ...MAKE HIM A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER? WHO IS STILL GAY. NOT SURE THAT'S ANY BETTER. LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT... IT'S GOOD TO COURT A LITTLE CONTROVERSY. WHO'S NEXT, DARREN? NEXT UP IS STEPHEN DALE. HE PLAYS BILLY, THE ONE WHO DREAMS OF BEING A WRITER. HE'S GOT A STOMACH LIKE A WASHBOARD. AND THEN THERE'S THE ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS AMY LOCANE PLAYING SANDY... THE SOUTHERN GIRL WHO WANTS TO BE A MOVIE-STAR AND WILL DO ANYTHING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. WE FOUND A TERRIFIC NEW YORK THEATER ACTOR BY THE NAME OF THOMAS CALABRO, HE PLAYS "MICHAEL," THE E.R. DOCTOR WHO ALSO MANAGES THE APARTMENT COMPLEX. AND FINALLY, THERE'S THE RED-HOT JOSIE BISSETT, PLAYING HIS WIFE. ONLY 22 YEARS OLD, YET EVERY SHOW ON TELEVISION WANTED JOSIE THIS YEAR, BUT WE GOT HER. SO, LARRY? WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHAT DO I THINK? TO BE HONEST, AARON, I THINK THAT YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF A GREEN LIGHT. CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'RE A GREAT EXECUTIVE, LARRY! OH, I AM TODAY. - THANKS, LARRY. - CONGRATULATIONS. GREAT STUFF. WE DID IT. I'VE BEEN SO EXCITED, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP. I KNOW A FEW YOGA POSES THAT COULD REALLY HELP WITH THAT. SLEEP IS OVERRATED. THAT'S SOMETHING JOHNNY TAUGHT ME. - JOHNNY? - JOHNNY DEPP. I WAS IN CRY-BABY WITH HIM. OH, THAT'S RIGHT! I TOTALLY FORGOT. YOU HAVE TO TELL US EVERYTHING. IS HE NICE? IS HE FUNNY? WAIT. IS HE STILL DATING WINONA RYDER? DID YOU GET TO KISS HIM? DIDN'T YOU SEE THE MOVIE? HE TEACHES HER HOW TO FRENCH KISS! THEN THEY RIDE A MOTORCYCLE, THERE'S THIS CHICKEN RACE... AND A LOT MORE HAPPENED OFF-CAMERA, LET ME TELL YOU. SO, THE FIRST STORY IS ABOUT AN ACTING COACH... I DON'T KNOW, IT'S DEFINITELY SUNNIER THAN CANADA, BUT I FEEL LIKE, EVENTUALLY, I'M GONNA MISS HAVING SEASONS. OH, NO. WE HAVE SEASONS. SMOG SEASON, RIOT SEASON, EARTHQUAKE SEASON. YOU CAN USE A POOL FOR PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THEM. SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A POOL! NO, WE HAVE A POOL BECAUSE IT'S AN EXCUSE TO GET THE CAST IN BATHING SUITS AND BIKINIS. HOPEFULLY, JUST YOU GIRLS. I AM NOT WEARING A GRAPE-SNUGGLER. I JUST THINK, TV... WHO CAN'T DO THAT? YOU GET A MILLION TAKES, AND IF IT STILL STINKS, THEY JUST FIX IT IN EDITING. THEATER ACTING, THOUGH... THAT'S THE REAL THING. I GUESS. BUT WHO EVEN GOES TO THE THEATER ANYWAYS? OLD, RICH PEOPLE AND TOURISTS. YOU KNOW WHO WATCHES TV? HOT BABES. AW, HEY, IT'S ALL JUST GETTING PAID TO PRETEND, RIGHT? WE'RE LUCKY TO BE HERE. YEAH, YOU GOTTA PAY THE BILLS, I GUESS. I COULD THINK OF WORSE WAYS TO DO IT. YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE RIGHT. I BET DELIVERING PIZZAS WOULD BE WORSE. I USED TO DELIVER PIZZAS. OH. THAT'S GOOD. I-I MEAN, THAT'S COOL. PROBABLY BEATS WORKING CONSTRUCTION, RIGHT? I USED TO WORK CONSTRUCTION. OKAY! UH... WELL... JUST MESSING WITH YOU, MAN. OH, HO. FUNNY. FUNNY. I'M GONNA GET YOU. HILARIOUS. OH... OKAY, STEPHEN? YOU'RE GONNA COME OUT OF THE BEDROOM AND HIT YOUR MARK HALFWAY DOWN. GOT IT. PICTURE'S UP. AND ROLL SOUND. SOUND SPEED. AND... ACTION. NOT EXACTLY WHAT I HAD IN MIND WITH "JIGGLE TV." WHAT HAPPENED? HE WENT BACK TO CANADA FOR TWO MONTHS TO VISIT FAMILY. APPARENTLY, HE ATE THEM. WELL, HE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR HIM TO LOSE THE WEIGHT. THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIRE HIM. MM-HMM. ME? THE KEY IS TO DO IT IN A WAY TO MAKE 'EM STILL LOVE YOU, BECAUSE, IN THIS BUSINESS, YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE PEOPLE ARE GONNA END UP. FIRE 'EM THIS YEAR, THEY'RE A STAR THE NEXT. ALWAYS PRESERVE YOUR RELATIONSHIP. LARRY, WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET. WE'RE UNDERSTAFFED AS IT IS... HI. HI, STEPHEN, IT'S... IT'S... OH. FORGET IT. HELLO? HI, STEPHEN. IT'S DARREN STAR. OH, HEY, DARREN, HOW'S IT GOING? I JUST GOTTA SAY, I HAD THE BEST TIME ON SET YESTERDAY. I'M REALLY EXCITED FOR THIS SHOW. STEPHEN... WE... ACTUALLY, WE NEED TO TALK. I, UM... WELL, I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS. DADDY, THAT'S HORRIBLE. FIRED AFTER TWO DAYS? I FEEL BAD FOR HIM. UNFORTUNATELY, TORI, HE LEFT US WITH NO CHOICE, AND NOW WE'RE STUCK WITH FINDING A REPLACEMENT FOR MONDAY. THIS MONDAY? YES. AND ALL OUR RUNNER-UPS ON THAT ROLE HAVE BEEN CAST ON OTHER SHOWS. WE'RE IN A REAL BIND. BUT YOU ALWAYS SAID THERE'S TONS OF HOT ACTORS IN THIS TOWN. I BET I COULD EVEN FIND A DOZEN AT THE MALL TODAY. WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT THE BRANDON AND BRENDA ROLES ON YOUR SHOW, SWEETHEART. MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME OUT AGAIN. WHO DO YOU LIKE HERE? HMM... WHAT ABOUT... THIS GUY... ANDREW SHUE? "ANDREW SHUE." SAYS HERE HE'S A GRADUATE OF DARTMOUTH, FORMER ALL-AMERICAN SOCCER PLAYER? WELL, WE KNOW AT LEAST THIS ONE'LL STAY THIN. OH, AARON! YOU'RE TERRIBLE. WELL, IT'S TRUE! ALSO, HE'S THE BROTHER OF ELIZABETH SHUE. WELL, CLEARLY, TALENT RUNS IN HIS FAMILY. I GOT TO MAKE A PHONE CALL. TORI, HONEY... I LOVE YOU. WOW. ALL THE CLASSICS. FANTASY ISLAND... HART TO HART. THE LOVE BOAT. ANDREW. THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND. WELL, KID... YOU BLEW US AWAY. CONGRATULATIONS. YOU GOT THE PART. WE'RE THRILLED TO HAVE YOU ONBOARD, ANDREW. WOW! REALLY? WHEN DO I START? MONDAY. LIKE THE DAY-AFTER-TOMORROW MONDAY? HE KNOWS THE CALENDAR, TOO! I TOLD YOU THESE DARTMOUTH BOYS ARE SMART. COME ON OUT, EVERYONE. ANDREW, MEET OUR HAIR, MAKEUP, AND WARDROBE TEAM. YOU'LL BE IN GOOD HANDS. WE'LL SEE YOU ON MONDAY. LOOK AT YOU AND LOOK AT THAT HAIR. HERE WE GO. WHAT KIND OF PRODUCTS ARE YOU USING RIGHT NOW? - "PRODUCTS"? - YEAH. DO YOU HAVE ANY MAKEUP ALLERGIES THAT WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT? - GOOD ONE. - THAT'S IMPORTANT. - MAKEUP? - AND ONE, TWO... OVER HERE. AND FLASHING. THIS IS MY PERSONAL CONDITIONER. I WANT YOU TO START USING THIS UP TO SEVEN TIMES A DAY. ANDREW, THIS IS YOUR CALL SHEET. ALL OF THE PHONE NUMBERS YOU'LL NEED ARE HERE. AND NOW FOX PRESS AND MARKETING WILL BE CONTACTING YOU SOMETIME THIS WEEK. MAKE SURE YOU DON'T TALK TO ANYONE BEFORE. THE WRITERS WILL ALSO BE CONTACTING YOU SHORTLY... ACTUALLY, IT'S AMAZING ANYONE CHOOSES TO BE AN ACTOR. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THEY MAKE TONS OF MONEY FOR PLAYING MAKE-BELIEVE. IT'S THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD! IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, OR JUST NEED TO TALK, HAVE DINNER, MY NUMBER'S AT THE TOP OF THE CALL SHEET FOR YOU. AND CONGRATULATIONS ON BOOKING THE ROLE OF BILLY, MR. SHUE. HAVE FUN ON SET. OKAY, EVERYBODY, SUCK IT IN. YOU KNOW THE CAMERA ADDS 10 POUNDS. I HOPE NOT. 10 POUNDS CAN GET YOU FIRED. IT CAN? YOU PLAY SOCCER EVERY DAY. JUST REMEMBER TO KEEP CHASING AROUND THE LITTLE BALL. DAMN, IS IT TOO LATE TO RETURN THAT, UH, "WELCOME TO THE CAST" CAKE I BOUGHT? BRING THAT TO MY TRAILER, WILL YOU? I'LL BRING SOMETHING ELSE TO YOUR TRAILER. I'LL HOLD YOU TO THAT! SO FOX HAS DECIDED TO SPEND A FORTUNE TO MARKET THIS SHOW. I JUST PRAY IT'S A HIT. YOU AND ME BOTH. HEY! COME ON! WE'RE WATCHING MELROSE PLACE. I'M WATCHING THE GAME. IT'S NOT EVEN ON... SHH! SHH! OH, GOD... THAT GRANT SHOW IS SO HOT. I WANT TO CLIMB HIM LIKE A TREE. MM-HMM! WELL, WHAT DOES HE GOT THAT I DON'T? SERIOUSLY? HEY, EVERYBODY. LISTEN UP. THE REVIEWS ARE IN. "IT'S LIKE EACH APARTMENT ON MELROSE PLACE "CAME WITH A FREE LOBOTOMY AND A GIFT CERTIFICATE FROM THE GAP." OF COURSE, BECAUSE THERE'S NO DEPTH. THE STORYLINES ARE SAFE AND SHALLOW. HEY, I'LL TAKE YOUR SAFE-AND-SHALLOW STORYLINES IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM. I MEAN, I DIDN'T EXPECT THE SHOW TO WIN AN EMMY, BUT I ALSO DIDN'T THINK IT'D GET SLAMMED LIKE THIS. WELL, I HOPE IT DOESN'T GET CANCELED. I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING PART OF A SHOW THAT LASTED MORE THAN ONE SEASON. IF THIS SHOW GETS CANCELED, I'LL JUST GO BACK TO NEW YORK. DO SOME REAL ACTING... IN THE THEATER. ALL RIGHT. WHO WANTS TO HELP ME BUY HIM A PLANE TICKET BACK TO NEW YORK? ANYONE? "MELROSE PLACE... "THE SUMMER'S MOST HIGHLY ANTICIPATED SERIES, "HAS THE ODOR OF CLONED CREATIVE STALEMATE. "PUT IT THIS WAY... "IF YOU LOVE BEVERLY HILLS 90210, YOU PROBABLY DESERVE MELROSE." OUCH! OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? 16 MILLION PEOPLE SMELLED THAT ODOR AND THEY LOVED IT. 16 MILLION WATCHED THE FIRST EPISODE, BUT WE'VE SLIPPED FOR THE SECOND, THIRD, AND FOURTH. THEY KEEP DROPPING AND... OKAY, OKAY. IT TOOK SOME TIME FOR 90210 TO BECOME A HIT, TOO. BINGO! NO "BINGO." PEOPLE ONLY GAVE 90210 A CHANCE BECAUSE FOX DOESN'T DO NEWS, AND WHEN SADDAM INVADED KUWAIT, WE WERE THE ONLY THING ON-AIR THAT WASN'T ENTIRELY FOCUSED ON THE GULF WAR. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE EPISODE WHERE BRANDON LAUNCHED THE S.C.U.D. AT THE PEACH PIT? EXPLAIN TO ME HOW YOU GOT HIRED AGAIN. I HAVE NO IDEA. I'M JUST SAYING, YOU SHOULD LET AMY GO. HER CHARACTER DOESN'T POP AND HER ACCENT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE. THE CAST NEEDS SOME TIME, BUT THEY'LL GEL EVENTUALLY, EVEN AMY. LOOK AT THAT... ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST. WELL, I'M SURE THEY WOULD'VE FIGURED IT OUT EVENTUALLY, LIKE ROUND TABLE, OR 2000 MALIBU ROAD, OR EVERY OTHER CANCELED SHOW THIS SEASON. AARON, I DON'T WANT TO GET CANCELED BEFORE WE'VE HAD A DECENT SHOT. THIS IS YOUR SHOT. MY ADVICE IS TO START THINKING ABOUT HOW TO INCREASE OUR RATINGS, OR BOTH OUR CAREERS ARE IN THE CRAPPER. WELL, YOURS ANYWAY. COFFEE FOR YOU? YOU TOO? OKAY. DAPHNE! HI. NO, I'M NOT READY, I'M WAITING FOR A FRIEND. OH, I'M NOT YOUR WAITRESS. I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH I LOVED THE SURE THING. AND... YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY LOST MY VIRGINITY TO A GUY WHO LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE JOHN CUSACK, SO YOU AND ME HAVE A LOT IN COMMON. OH, OKAY, WOW. HEY, DAPHNE, SORRY I'M LATE. DID YOU ALREADY ORDER? SHE'S NOT OUR WAITRESS. I JUST CAME TO TELL HER HOW MUCH I LOVE HER WORK. WELL, THEN, THAT MAKES TWO OF US. OH, DON'T TRY AND BUTTER ME UP. YOU ARE IN THE DOGHOUSE, MISTER. I KNOW! I KNOW, I'M SORRY. IT'S BEEN WAY TOO LONG. BUT TRUST ME, I BARELY HAVE TIME TO SLEEP THESE DAYS. IS IT THAT CRAZY? ARE YOU KIDDING? I HAVE TWO SHOWS! ONE, OBVIOUSLY, IS STILL FINDING ITS AUDIENCE. WELL, I LOVE IT. MELROSE REMINDS ME OF OUR COLLEGE DAYS. WHICH I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN. THAT IS WHY... I WANT TO OFFER YOU A ROLE ON THE SHOW. WHAT? ARE YOU SERIOUS? MM-HMM. DARREN! I WOULD LOVE IT. REALLY? YES! DID YOU WANT ME TO BEG? - I SWEAR... - ACTUALLY, COULD YOU BEG? I WAS GOING TO! YOU DON'T HAVE TO BEG. OH, MY GOD! I'M SO EXCITED! ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON. BEFORE YOU SAY YES, LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER. OKAY! HER NAME IS JO. SHE'S A PHOTOGRAPHER. SHE'S A BIT MYSTERIOUS. SHE DOESN'T TALK ABOUT HER PAST. I WANT TO BRING THIS "EAST COAST EDGE" TO THE SHOW. SHE'S ARTY, AND SHE'S MORE WORLDLY THAN ALL THE OTHER CHARACTERS. I'M THINKING THAT SHE COMES FROM NEW YORK CITY AND I REALLY WANT THE AUDIENCE TO WONDER ABOUT HER. HEY! FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL? YES! I'M DAPHNE. ZUNIGA. WELCOME, DAPHNE. I'M DOUG SAVANT. COME ON. LET ME CARRY YOUR BOOKS TO CLASS, INTRODUCE YOU TO THE OTHER KIDS. OKAY! WELCOME TO GLAMOROUS SANTA CLARITA! IS THAT WHERE WE ARE? I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE HIGHWAY CAME OUT THIS FAR. YOU WANT THE GRAND TOUR, "ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT" -STYLE? I'LL BE MARY HART. AND HERE, THE WORLD OF MELROSE PLACE IS BEING BUILT BY HAND. AND RIGHT HERE. AND A SURPRISE FOR YOU HERE. CHAIR WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. AND OVER THERE, YOU SEE MELROSE PLACE STARS COURTNEY THORNE-SMITH AND ANDREW SHUE "REHEARSING" AN INTIMATE SCENE. 32 EPISODES A SEASON... I GUESS YOU GOTTA REHEARSE WHEN YOU CAN. WELL, THEY REHEARSE THAT ONE PRETTY FREQUENTLY. OH! HEY, GUYS. I THINK YOU GOT IT DOWN. COME MEET DAPHNE. WE WERE JUST... GOING OVER SOME OF THE NEW ADJUSTMENTS. MM-HMM. I'M COURTNEY. I HEAR MY CHARACTER IS INSPIRED BY YOU. OH, I DON'T KNOW... YOU'VE REALLY MADE IT YOUR OWN. WELL, THANKS! ANDREW. NICE TO MEET YOU. SO YOU AND DARREN REALLY LIVED IN A PLACE THIS NICE RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE? OH! GOD, NO. THEY WOULDN'T LET YOU SHOW THE PLACE WE LIVED IN ON TV. IT WOULD BE TOO SAD. CAST AND KEYS! PLEASE REPORT TO SET FOR SCENE 14. HEY, I'LL COME FIND YOU WHEN WE BREAK FOR LUNCH. THEY SEEM NICE. A COUPLE IN REAL LIFE, HUH? THEY LIKE TO KEEP IT QUIET, BUT YEAH. A BUNCH OF ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE WORKING LONG HOURS, IT'S BOUND TO HAPPEN. NOT FOR ME. I GOT A WIFE AND A KID. AND ANOTHER ONE ON THE WAY. - OH... - DOUG! OH, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE VANESSA. "MAY THE SCHWARTZ BE WITH YOU!" I SEE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO LOVED YOU... - ...IN SPACEBALLS. - YOUR CHARACTER JO'S... ...GONNA HAVE TO GET HER OWN GAY BEST FRIEND, 'CAUSE MATT HERE BELONGS TO RHONDA. JO DOESN'T MAKE ANY OF HER OWN DECISIONS. IT'S ALL UP TO DARREN. HOPEFULLY, HE'S FEELING GENEROUS. FINGERS CROSSED. ACTUALLY, WE WANT TO TAKE A COUPLE OF OUR CHARACTERS IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. IF YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT RELIGION, POLITICS, OR THE PLIGHT OF THE HOMELESS, I SWEAR TO GOD... NO. NO, YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THIS... WE WANT MICHAEL TO CHEAT ON JANE WITH KIMBERLY. MARCIA CROSS HAS BEEN AMAZING AS KIMBERLY. IF THE EMMYS TONIGHT, SHE'D WIN ALL OF THEM, BUT THIS WILL BE A GREAT ARC FOR BOTH CHARACTERS. UNTIL NOW, MICHAEL HAS JUST BEEN THIS YOUNG, COCKY DOCTOR, WHO HAS FLIRTED WITH BEING A JERK, BUT WE WANT TO TAKE HIM FULLY TO THE JERK-SIDE BY HAVING HIM CHEAT WITH KIMBERLY. BELIEVE ME, THOMAS CAN DO THIS. HEY! YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONVINCE ME. I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU SPICING THINGS UP. MAKING IT A LITTLE SOAPY. I TOLD YOU FROM THE BEGINNING... I KNOW, IT'S JUST... I THINK I'M TRYING TO CONVINCE MYSELF. OCCASIONALLY, I'D LIKE TO DEAL WITH SOME REAL ISSUES ON THIS SHOW. DO WHAT I DID. MAKE SUCCESS YOUR TROJAN HORSE. I SNUCK THROUGH THE GATES WITH CHARLIE'S ANGELS AND DYNASTY, AND ONCE INSIDE, I MADE AND THE BAND PLAYED ON. BUT I COULDN'T HAVE DONE A MOVIE ABOUT A.I.D.S. WITHOUT ALSO DOING A SHOW ABOUT THREE BRA-LESS WOMEN FIGHTING CRIME. BE EARNEST LATER. NOTED... "MAKE THE WOMEN ON THE SHOW BRA-LESS." BELIEVE ME, SOON ENOUGH, YOU'LL BE CONSIDERING STORYLINES WITH HITMEN AND BLACKMAIL AND FROZEN EMBRYOS. HAPPENS TO ALL OF US. NOW, HOW'S YOUR FRIEND, DAPHNE, SETTLING IN? SHE'S DEFINITELY GETTING THE HANG OF IT. OF SOME OF IT. SO, GRANT... YOU'RE TIRED, YOU JUST LUGGED A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF UP THE STAIRS FOR THIS GIRL, BUT YOU'RE INTERESTED, SO... SO I'M GONNA ACT LIKE IT'S NO PROBLEM? EXACTLY. THEN DAPHNE, YOU'RE DISTRACTED WITH ALL THIS MOVING GOING ON AND YOU SUDDENLY REALIZE THAT THE POLITE THING TO DO IS TO INVITE HIM IN AND OFFER HIM A DRINK. YOU CAN SAY YOUR FIRST LINES. OH! UH, I'M SORRY. I-I DIDN'T REALIZE... NO PROBLEM. AFTER YOUR LINES, GRANT WILL POLITELY DECLINE, AND LEAVE YOU STANDING THERE, FRUSTRATED. OKAY? GREAT. SO WE'RE GONNA SHOOT IT THIS WAY, THEN WE'RE GONNA TURN IT AROUND AND GRAB GRANT'S REACTION. OKAY. SECOND TEAM IN. FIRST TEAM OUT. HI. THAT'S MY STAND-IN? OH, I KNOW, RIGHT? THE RESEMBLANCE IS EERIE. COME ON, LET'S GRAB SOMETHING TO EAT. DON'T GO TOO FAR. WE'LL BE READY TO SHOOT IN A MINUTE. YOU GOT IT. WE'RE SHOOTING? I THOUGHT THAT WAS BLOCKING, NOT REHEARSAL. ON THIS SHOW, BLOCKING IS REHEARSAL. I SHOULD'VE PREPARED MORE. I'M USED TO A FILM SET. IT MOVES MUCH SLOWER. NAH, YOU'LL BE FINE. THIS IS MELROSE PLACE, NOT MASTERPIECE THEATRE. I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE RULES OF SOCCER, BUT IS IT CUSTOMARY TO PLAY TWO GAMES IN THREE HOURS? KEEPS ME SANE, MAN. THIS PLACE IS... YOU OKAY? YEAH. YEAH. NOTHING A DAY OF SOCCER CAN'T CURE. HEY, COURTNEY! I'M SORRY, OKAY? OH. OH, GOD. HI. SOME OF US ARE GONNA GRAB DRINKS TONIGHT, IF YOU WANT TO JOIN. LOOKS LIKE YOU COULD USE ONE... - OR FIVE. - NO, NO, I'M GOOD. - I'M JUST... - I'M JUST TIRED. IT'S BEEN, UM... DOUG! THANKS FOR ASKING, THOUGH. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS? WE HAVE TWO SCENES TOTALING THREE AND A HALF PAGES. GRANT'S ABS GET MORE SCREEN TIME. THEY PROBABLY JUST NEED SPACE TO SET UP DAPHNE'S CHARACTER. AND, UH, I WOULDN'T COMPLAIN TOO LOUDLY ABOUT GRANT'S ABS. I HEAR THEY HAVE A REALLY POWERFUL AGENT. YOU WANNA COME UP TO MY PLACE? I CAN POUR YOU A COLD DRINK. THANKS, BUT, UM... MAYBE ANOTHER TIME. I'M GONNA TAKE A LITTLE DIP IN THE POOL. THEY HAVE REAL CHEMISTRY. YEAH, IF WE CAN EVER DO ANYTHING WITH IT. LARRY COMPLAINED THE LAST SCRIPT WAS TOO RACY. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET VIEWERS IF WE CAN'T PUSH THE ENVELOPE? NO RATINGS, NO FREEDOM. THAT'S HOW IT'S ALWAYS WORKED. AND NO FREEDOM, NO RATINGS... THAT'S A NICE CATCH-22 THEY'VE PUT US IN. TONE DOWN THE LITERARY REFERENCES. THEY GIVE ME A HEADACHE. ANYWAY, I ACTUALLY MIGHT HAVE AN IDEA TO GET RATINGS WITHOUT PUSHING THE ENVELOPE... A SPECIAL GUEST STAR. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO ANY MORE 90210 CROSS-OVERS. THERE'S ONLY SO MANY TIMES DONNA CAN COME OVER TO BORROW A CUP OF SUGAR. OH, IT'S NO ONE FROM 90210. THEN WHO? I DON'T WANT TO SAY TILL I'M SURE I CAN GET THEM. YOU CAN TELL ME. LET'S JUST SAY THEY'RE MY SECRET WEAPON. OH, COME ON! I GOTTA KNOW. IF I TOLD YOU, IT WOULDN'T BE A SECRET. WELL, IF THIS IS A PRANK AND YOU SHOW UP WITH JOE E. TATA, I'M GOING TO BE FURIOUS. BY THE WAY, LAURA LEIGHTON STARTS TODAY. WHO? THAT REDHEAD. SHE'S AUDITIONED FOR US HALF A DOZEN TIMES. WE CAST HER FOR A FEW EPISODES, BUT WE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER EXTENDING HER. I THINK SHE'S REALLY GOT SOMETHING. WHAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE ARE CREDITS. BUT LET'S SEE HOW SHE DOES. AND HERE YOU GO. WAIT. I'M SMOKING IN THIS SCENE? MM-HMM. I'VE NEVER SMOKED BEFORE. WELL, I GUESS THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT "ACTING." I'VE ALSO NEVER BEEN ON TV BEFORE. OKAY, LET'S WELCOME MISS LAURA LEIGHTON TO THE CAST. THIS IS HER FIRST DAY AND HER FIRST SCENE AS "SYDNEY ANDREWS." THANKS. HI, LAURA. DO YOU NEED ANY SIDES? NO, I ATE BEFORE I CAME. "SCRIPT SIDES"... I CAN PUT THEM ON YOUR CHAIR FOR YOU. OH. SURE, THANKS. OH, AND WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T INHALE, BECAUSE, WHEN WE SHOOT THIS SCENE FROM ANOTHER ANGLE, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE THE SAME NUMBER OF PUFFS. OH, GOD. DON'T WORRY, SWEETIE. I'VE GOT YOU COVERED. I'LL KEEP TRACK OF EVERYTHING YOU DO IN THIS SCENE AND REMIND YOU. YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT. ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, SETTLE. LAURA, LIGHT UP. AND... ROLL CAMERA. HOLD THE ROLL. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, LAURA? OKAY, JUST REMEMBER, DON'T INHALE, RELAX. MORE THAN HALFWAY THROUGH THIS SEASON AND THEY KEEP ADDING NEW CHARACTERS. EITHER THEY'RE REALLY DESPERATE OR SHE'S REALLY GOOD. OR MAYBE THERE AREN'T ENOUGH INCREDIBLY HOT GIRLS ON THIS SHOW. I HEARD SHE CAN ACT. EVEN IF SHE CAN'T, WHO CARES? THAT BODY ALONE IS WORTH TWO NIELSEN POINTS. AW, TRUST ME. DON'T GO THERE, MAN. HE AND COURTNEY HAVING PROBLEMS? NO IDEA. JUST LIKE MY CHARACTER, I WANT TO BE INVOLVED AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE. YOU'LL BE FINE. OKAY! WE'RE READY. LET'S SHOOT THIS. DID YOU SEE THAT SMILE? OH, DAMN. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY JUST GIVE US ALL THIS STUFF FOR FREE. SURE, IT'S FREE ADVERTISING FOR THEM IF WE USE IT OR TALK ABOUT IT. UNLESS IT SAYS IT'S NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS, I WON'T USE IT. WHY EVEN BOTHER? WHAT'S THE POINT OF THREE HOURS OF WARDROBE IF I HAVE TO GET MY SHIRT TAKEN OFF 30 SECONDS INTO EACH EPISODE? NICE TO SEE A MAN BEING OBJECTIFIED FOR A CHANGE. WHAT'S SO FUNNY OVER HERE? OH, NOTHING. WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT MAKEUP. WARDROBE PROBLEMS? I'M SHIRTLESS IN EVERY EPISODE. - OHH... - AMERICA PROBABLY... ...HAS MY NIPPLES BURNED INTO THEIR TV SCREENS. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING TO STOP WORKING OUT. THAT WAY, THEY'LL LET ME KEEP MY SHIRT ON. - NO! - DON'T! MARCIA... YOU LITTLE HOME-WRECKER, HUH? FINALLY, WE GET SOMETHING JUICY. NO KIDDING! NOTHING JUICIER THAN A MISCARRIAGE. THAT CAME OUT WRONG. THAT WASN'T GREAT EITHER. I'M SURE, AS SOON AS THE AFFAIR GETS BORING, POOR KIMBERLY WILL CONVENIENTLY DECIDE TO CLEAN HER HIGH-POWERED RIFLE COLLECTION OR TAKE A TRAGIC INTEREST IN LANDMINE REMOVAL. OH, WELL, IT WAS FUN BEING HERE WHILE IT LASTED. I WOULDN'T BE TOO SURE. ONCE THEY SEE YOU GO FULL-TILT ON THESE SCENES... I'VE SEEN YOU ONSTAGE. I KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO. THAT'S SWEET OF YOU TO SAY. IT'S THE TRUTH. NOW, COME ON. LET'S SHOW THESE MODELS HOW REAL ACTORS DO IT, HUH? IF YOU WEREN'T AN ACTOR, WHAT WOULD YOU DO FOR A LIVING? DO YOU THINK ABOUT GOING BACK TO PLAYING PRO SOCCER? I DON'T KNOW... I MEAN, I'VE BEEN THINKING I WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT LEAVES THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. BUT I LOVE THIS JOB, AND, YOU KNOW... I'M JUST NOT EXACTLY CURING CANCER. NO, WE LEAVE THE CANCER-CURING TO COURTNEY THORNE-SMITH. THIS IS DOUG SAVANT, OUR RESIDENT COMEDIAN. DO YOU THINK YOUR CHARACTER WILL EVER GET A BOYFRIEND? EVENTUALLY, I HOPE SO. IS THERE SOMEONE OFF-SCREEN? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? DO YOU HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OTHER? LET'S SEE... THERE WAS ALEX, AND THEN JAMIE, AND, UH, NOW PAT. DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION? SO YOUR LOVE LIFE OFF-SCREEN IS ABOUT THE SAME AS IT IS ON-SCREEN? I WOULDN'T SAY THAT! SO YOU'RE NOT GAY? I WOULDN'T SAY THAT EITHER. OH... WOW. OKAY, SO THAT'S OFFICIALLY A "NO" ON THE "POLYGAMY" STORYLINE. UH, WHAT ABOUT... CAN'T WE INJURE SOMEBODY? WE ALREADY HAD A CAR-JACKING. YEAH, BUT BILLY DIDN'T GET INJURED, HE JUST GOT, YOU KNOW, RACIST. HE WASN'T A RACIST. HE JUST NEEDED TO BECOME MORE... AWARE THAT THERE ARE RACIAL INEQUALITIES HERE IN LOS ANGELES. RIGHT, BECAUSE, APPARENTLY, HE'S THE ONLY PERSON NOT AWARE OF THAT AFTER THE WHOLE RODNEY KING BEATING. BECAUSE APPARENTLY HE'S ALSO THE ONLY PERSON NOT AWARE OF THAT LITTLE RIOT THING THAT WE HAD HERE IN L.A. WELL, YOU KNOW, NEWS TRAVELS SLOW, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT HITS THE 405. DARREN'S RIGHT. PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN ONLY CARE ABOUT TWO THINGS... WHO'S SCREWING WHO AND WHO'S SCREWING OVER WHO. "WHOM." WHO'S SCREWING OVER WHOM. OH, WE SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW THAT AS WE'RE, YOU KNOW, WRITERS. IF WE WERE GOOD WRITERS, WE WOULD. YEAH? PLEASE PUT HIM THROUGH. HI, AARON. REALLY? OF COURSE! SHE IS PERFECT! SHE'S GOING TO BE PERFECT. YES, I AM EXCITED. THIS IS GREAT. ALL RIGHT. THANKS, AARON. THAT'S THE BEST PIECE OF NEWS I'VE HEARD SINCE THIS SHOW STARTED. ...PROBABLY DO THAT. I LOVE FILM. YEAH, ME TOO. WHAT ABOUT YOU, GRANT? YOU EVER WANT TO DO FEATURES? I HAD TO TURN DOWN THELMA & LOUISE. I DOUBT I'LL EVER GET ANOTHER SHOT LIKE THAT. DON'T SAY THAT! OF COURSE, YOU WILL. MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT. MAYBE THELMA & LOUISE BOMBS. MAYBE IT'S THE END OF BRAD PITT'S CAREER. WHO'S BRAD PITT? THE NOBODY THEY'RE REPLACING ME WITH. MOVIES AREN'T ALWAYS BETTER THAN TELEVISION, TRUST ME. I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THIS JOB. JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE I'M GONNA HAVE IT MUCH LONGER. WE'VE ONLY GOT 10 OR 12 EPISODES LEFT THIS SEASON AND NOT A PEEP ABOUT GETTING RENEWED FOR A SECOND. WELL, MAYBE THIS MYSTERIOUS GUEST STAR WILL GET THE NETWORK TO START PEEPING. IT MUST BE SOMEONE BIG. LIKE, BILLY RAY CYRUS BIG. OOH... WHOEVER IT IS, HE'S GONNA HAVE BE A HELL OF AN ACTOR TO TURN THIS ENTIRE SERIES AROUND. ACTRESS. I HEAR THAT "HE" IS A SHE, WHICH PROBABLY MEANS... SHE'S GONNA SLEEP WITH ONE OF US. WHO KNOWS, MAYBE SHE'LL TURN MATT STRAIGHT. WELL, IF ANYBODY COULD DO IT, I'M BETTING IT'LL BE HER. OH, MY GOD. IS THAT HEATHER LOCKLEAR? IN THE FLESH. DID SOMEBODY ORDER A BITCH? TOMMY, WOULD YOU RELAX? YOU'RE A GREAT DRUMMER. MOTLEY CRUE'S MUSIC IS TIMELESS. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOUR SINGER IS. I'VE BEEN HEARING RUMORS ABOUT YOU AND... THAT WAS AN AWFULLY QUICK DENIAL. NO, I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'M GOING TO BE HOME. WELL, YOU CAN WORK ON YOUR DRUMMING UNTIL I GET THERE. THERE'S SOMEBODY AT THE DOOR, TOMMY. I HAVE TO GO. JUST LIKE OLD TIMES. THANK YOU FOR THE FLOWERS. THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. OH, IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO. ARE YOU KIDDING? YOU GAVE ME MY CAREER. I OFFERED YOU A ROLE! YOU MADE YOUR OWN CAREER. WELL, I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL. YOU BRING YOUR OWN HEAT TO THIS SHOW, AND I'LL BE THE ONE WHO'S FOREVER GRATEFUL. YOU LIKE THESE FLOWERS? I'LL BUY YOU A FULL-TIME FLORIST. NOT SURE TOMMY WOULD LOVE HIM AROUND THE HOUSE. THEN I'M NOT SO SURE TOMMY'S RIGHT FOR YOU. MWAH! KNOCK 'EM DEAD, KID. I'LL TRY. SEEYA ON THE SET, SWEETHEART. FINAL TOUCHES, PLEASE. OKAY, LET'S SHOOT THIS. ROLL SOUND! SOUND SPEED. AND... ACTION! I NEED THESE BY 9:00 A.M. TOMORROW. BUT IT'S 6:00. I WASN'T ASKING WHAT TIME IT WAS, I WAS TELLING YOU WHAT TIME I NEED THESE. IS THIS BECAUSE YOU THINK I'M THE ONE THAT TOLD? I ALREADY TOLD YOU, I DIDN'T. THIS ISN'T HIGH SCHOOL, ALISON. I DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR THE INTEREST TO CARE WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME BEHIND MY BACK. WELL, I DIDN'T. I WOULD NEVER UNDERMINE ANOTHER WOMAN LIKE THAT. OH, BUT YOU'D DO IT TO A MAN? NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT. THE IRONY IS... I PROBABLY WOULD'VE RESPECTED YOU MORE HAD YOU SAID IT. CUT! THAT WAS SO GREAT! THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU WERE SO GOOD. CONGRATULATIONS. OH, THANKS, GUYS. THAT WAS FUN. OH, WHERE IS CRAFTY? WONDERFUL. A TOUR DE FORCE. CAN SHE ACT OR WHAT? SHE'S LIKE OLIVIER... BUT SHE LOOKS BETTER IN TIGHTS. HEROES ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS THEIR OPPOSING FORCES ARE BAD. SHE'S THE FEMALE VILLAIN. THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY NEEDED. OTHELLO WAS NOTHING WITHOUT IAGO. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUT HEATHER WAS ELECTRIC. FORGET WHAT I SAID ABOUT TONING DOWN THE SEX. GO CRAZY. PUSH BOUNDARIES. REALLY? WHAT IS THE POINT OF HAVING THE SEXIEST CAST ON TELEVISION IF WE'RE MAKING THEM ACT LIKE THE WALTONS? GO FOR IT. HOW'S THE FOOD AROUND HERE? CRAFT SERVICE ISN'T BAD, BUT... YOU KNOW, IT COULD ALWAYS BE BETTER. I HAVE A GUY WHO MAKES THE BEST ESPRESSO. I'LL BRING HIM IN EVERY FRIDAY. OH! DOUG. CAN I TALK TO YOU A MINUTE? - SURE. - THANK YOU. I KNOW THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE GUESSING BY NOT COMING OUT AND TELLING THE PRESS THAT YOU'RE STRAIGHT... ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT ABOUT KEEPING PEOPLE GUESSING. - OH? - I JUST DON'T WANT ANYONE... ...TO THINK I'M DISTANCING MYSELF FROM PLAYING A GAY CHARACTER BY ANNOUNCING THAT I'M STRAIGHT IN REAL LIFE. I DON'T SEE A REASON FOR IT. I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND YOUR DEDICATION TO THE GAY COMMUNITY. I JUST THINK THAT IT MAKES FOR LESS CONFUSION TO OUR AUDIENCE. THE NETWORK DOESN'T NEED THAT KIND OF... SPECULATION AT THIS TIME. AND WHAT KIND OF SPECULATION IS THAT? THE KIND THAT LOWERS OUR RATINGS. OH, COME ON, BARBARA. YOU'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN THE SHOW? WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN ABOUT? I HAVE SEEN EVERY SINGLE EPISODE. OKAY, GREAT. WHO IS JAKE SLEEPING WITH RIGHT NOW? AH! BUSTED. YOU GOT ME. WHO'S THAT WOMAN WITH HEATHER? THAT'S BARBARA. SHE MANAGES HEATHER... AND ME. OH. WHO MANAGES YOU? I DON'T HAVE A MANAGER YET. I GUESS I SHOULD GET ONE, RIGHT? OH, ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, IT'S REALLY HARD TO SURVIVE IN THIS BUSINESS WITHOUT ONE. YOU SHOULD SIGN WITH BARBARA. SHE REALLY KNOWS HER STUFF. I'LL INTRODUCE YOU LATER. YOU KNOW, I HATE TO ADMIT IT, BUT WHEN I FIRST HEARD YOU WOULD BE ON THE SHOW, I WAS KIND OF... SCARED? NERVOUS? WORRIED I'D SHOW UP COKED OUT AFTER PARTYING FOR THREE DAYS STRAIGHT? BASICALLY. BUT I THOUGHT MORE LIKE TWO DAYS OF PARTYING. I THOUGHT FOUR, MAYBE. YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A WRONG IMPRESSION OF ME. I GUESS BECAUSE OF TOMMY, BUT, REALLY, I'M JUST A NORMAL CALIFORNIA GAL... I LIKE TACOS, THE BEACH, MICK JAGGER'S LEARJET. IT'S LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY TO THE PUBLIC "IT'S OKAY WE HAVE A GAY GUY ON THE SHOW BECAUSE HE'S NOT GAY IN REAL LIFE." MAYBE THEY'VE GOTTEN FLAK FROM ADVERTISERS. WHO'S THE ADVERTISER? PAT ROBERTSON? I FEEL LIKE THEY MIGHT BE SETTING UP TO GET RID OF ME. THEY'RE NOT GETTING RID OF EITHER OF US. WE'RE THE ONLY EDGY THINGS ABOUT THIS SHOW. WE'RE THE GAY GUY AND THE BLACK GIRL. SO I WANT TO REWRITE ALL THE DIALOGUE THAT WE HAVE FOR HEATHER'S REMAINING SCENES. I JUST LOVE THE WAY SHE DELIVERS THOSE LINES. IT'S LIKE I'M WATCHING A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SHOW. I COMPLETELY AGREE. IT'S LIKE A WHOLE NEW SPIN ON THE CHARACTER. EXACTLY. IT'S LIKE A SHOT OF ADRENALINE... THAT I THINK I WANT TO USE AND REWORK INTO THE SCENES WE HAVE GOING FORWARD. WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE? YOU SHOULD BE WRITING. RELAX. HE'S KIDDING. LIGHTEN UP, FRANK! WE WERE ACTUALLY JUST TALKING ABOUT THE PLANS WE HAVE FOR HEATHER'S SCENES. SHAME WE ONLY HAVE HER FOR THREE MORE EPISODES. THESE AREN'T MY TACOS. WELL, BEFORE YOU GUYS WRITE HER EXIT... WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I COULD GET HER TO JOIN THE SHOW? AARON, IF YOU'RE SERIOUS... I SAY DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO, BECAUSE I THINK WE JUST FOUND THE MISSING PIECE THAT COULD SAVE THIS SHOW. HEY! WAIT UP! I JUST HEARD! WHY DIDN'T YOU COME FIND ME? BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DOING THIS... I WANTED TO LEAVE MELROSE PLACE WITH DIGNITY. LISTEN... YOU DID A GREAT JOB. WHAT'S HAPPENING HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. IT'S NOTHING ANY OF US CAN CONTROL. IT'S UP TO THE GODS. OR, YOU KNOW... DARREN AND AARON. WELL, SO MUCH FOR THE POWER OF PRAYER. WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITHOUT YOU? SERIOUSLY! WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITHOUT ME? YOUR CHARACTER WAS BASICALLY MY SIDEKICK. HEY, NOT BEING ON THIS ISN'T THE END OF THE WORLD. YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S NOT. IT JUST... FEELS LIKE IT RIGHT NOW. BUT I NEED A ROLE WHERE I CAN REALLY SHINE. THIS WASN'T IT. I MEAN, WHO KNOWS? MAYBE THIS IS THE BEST THING TO HAVE HAPPENED TO ME. I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, DOUG. SEE YOU AROUND, VANESSA. DARREN, HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY THINK THAT? THE NUMBERS HAVE SHOT UP EVERY WEEK SINCE HEATHER'S BEEN ON. I KNOW, AND I'M THRILLED! IT'S JUST... IT'S JUST NOT THE SHOW I SET OUT TO MAKE. NOTHING EVER TURNS OUT THE WAY WE THINK IT'S GOING TO. THAT'S HOLLYWOOD! HELL, THAT'S NOT JUST HOLLYWOOD, THAT'S LIFE, KID. BUT YOU NEED TO GET OVER IT, BECAUSE THIS SHOW IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE! HI. THANKS SO MUCH. OH! HELLO, MISS LEIGHTON. LET ME GET THE DOOR FOR YOU. WHY, THANK YOU, MR. SHOW. I COULD TEAR THIS OFF YOU. THE WARDROBE LADY WOULD KILL YOU. AT LEAST I'D DIE HAPPY. WHAT IF SOMEBODY SAW YOU COME IN HERE? I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA KEEP OUR RELATIONSHIP SECRET. "SECRET" IMPLIES THAT WE'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG, WHICH WE'RE NOT... I THINK "PRIVATE" IS A BETTER WORD. I KNOW, I JUST... WHAT? I JUST... I TAKE THIS JOB SERIOUSLY, AND I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING TO JEOPARDIZE IT. JUST LOOK AT ANDREW AND COURTNEY. I THINK THEY'RE HANDLING IT WELL. THEY'RE PROS... LIKE US. AND CUT! HEY, LISTEN, UM... NO MORE TONGUE, OKAY? WHAT? OH! YEAH. NOW THAT WE'RE BROKEN UP... YEAH. YEAH, NO PROBLEM. THANK YOU. COURT? ARE WE OKAY? YEAH. OF COURSE. I LOVE VISITING THE SET. YOU KNOW, THE MAGIC OF FILMMAKING. THE MAGIC OF A CATERED LUNCH. WELL, THAT'S GOOD, TOO, BUT SERIOUSLY, I GET INSPIRED, YOU KNOW, IT GETS THE CREATIVE JUICES FLOWING. YEAH, WELL, HAVING THE WRITERS AROUND MAKES THE ACTORS CRAZY. ESPECIALLY NOW, WHEN THEY THINK THEY KNOW THE CHARACTERS BETTER THAN WE DO. THEY DON'T ACTUALLY THINK THAT, DO THEY? DARREN! HI. LISTEN, DOING THAT CAT-FIGHT SCENE WITH LAURA WAS SO GREAT FOR ME. I GOT TO ACCESS ALL THIS ANGER, RIGHT? SO I WAS THINKING, BECAUSE MY CHARACTER IS SO SWEET AND INNOCENT, WHAT IF, AFTER BEING CHEATED ON BY HER HUSBAND AND THEN BETRAYED BY HER SISTER... SHE JUST SNAPS! AND SHE GETS THIS CRAZY LOOK IN HER EYE, ALMOST LIKE A JEKYLL-AND-HYDE KINDA THING. ONE SECOND, SHE'S ALL... "HI! HOW NICE TO SEE YOU!" THEN SHE'S LIKE... "I'LL RIP YOUR GUTS OUT!" HUH? KIND OF A SPLIT-PERSONALITIES THING. I'M PRETTY SURE NO SOAP HAS EVER TRIED IT. YEAH. NO. BET THEY HAVEN'T. YEAH, UM... BUT... HUH. YOU SEE, THE THING IS, EVERY CAST NEEDS ITS MORAL CENTER, AND YOU'RE KIND OF IT FOR THIS SHOW. OKAY. - AH! - OH, JESUS! SEE? AT LEAST THINK ABOUT IT. YOU'RE A LIVE-WIRE. OH... I THINK WE SHOULD JUST DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS. I FEEL GENUINELY UNSAFE RIGHT NOW. THE ARTICHOKES ARE FLOWERS. - THE ARTICHOKE IS A FLOWER? - THE ARTICHOKE ITSELF IS A FL... - HEY! - ...BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS... THERE YOU ARE. I WANTED TO RUN SOMETHING BY YOU GUYS. - YEAH? - SURE, WHAT'S GOING ON? SO WE ALL KNOW JO'S EX-HUSBAND WAS ABUSIVE. SO, WHAT IF... HE SUDDENLY TURNS UP DEAD AND WHOEVER DID IT TRIES TO PIN IT ON ME? I DON'T KNOW... I MEAN, WE'VE ALREADY KILLED ONE EX-BOYFRIEND. YEAH, WE GOTTA BE CAREFUL. WE DON'T WANT YOU BECOMING A SERIAL KILLER. HEY! THAT IS A GREAT IDEA. I WOULD LOVE TO PLAY A SERIAL KILLER. THAT WAY, IF YOU EVER NEED TO WRITE ANYONE OFF THE SHOW, I CAN JUST... - OH! WOW. - ...STAB THEM. OR, UM, I COULD DROWN 'EM. UH... OOH! I COULD CHOKE 'EM! THAT'S, UH... THOSE ARE ALL GOOD OPTIONS. I COULD SHANK 'EM. THERE IT IS. I DON'T KNOW IF WE... IF THAT'S THE DIRECTION... WE WERE TALKING ABOUT? UH, I'M SO SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU... - NO! GOOD. - WE ARE SO LATE... ...FOR A MEETING RIGHT NOW WITH AARON. - BUT, UM... - OH, RIGHT! I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT WHEN WE WERE IN THE ROOM. IT WAS REALLY NICE SEEING YOU, THOUGH. GREAT SWEATER. YOU LOOK AMAZING. YEAH. I COULD SHOOT 'EM! - GOOD IDEA! - ARE YOU WRITING THESE DOWN? I GOT IT ALL RIGHT HERE. HE'S GOT A MEMORY! - ALL RIGHT, SEEYA. - THANKS, DAPHNE. HANG ON A SECOND. I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD A MEETING WITH AARON. - WE DON'T. - WE DON'T? OH! YOU'RE GOOD. DARREN! I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE PROBABLY BUSY. YEAH, WE ARE. I'LL JUST GIVE YOU A QUICK SUMMARY ABOUT THIS ARTICLE I READ ON SLEEP-WALKING. APPARENTLY, PEOPLE DO CRAZY THINGS IN THEIR SLEEP. THEY GET ON BUSES, THEY GO TO DIFFERENT CITIES, THEY START FAMILIES, THEY ROB BANKS... AND I THOUGHT MAYBE ALISON COULD WAKE UP ONE DAY, LIKE, "WHOA! WHAT'S THIS BANK? THIS BANK ISN'T MY BED!" YEAH! TOT... I LOVE THAT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE ACTUALLY... WE'RE LATE FOR A MEETING WITH AARON. - WE'RE VERY LATE. - OH! YEAH. WHY DON'T YOU SEND ME THE ARTICLE? YOU KNOW WHAT? I WILL FIND IT. - OKAY, GREAT! THANK YOU. - SEE YOU. OHH... YOU WERE RIGHT. IT'S SCARY HERE. LET'S NOT COME BACK TO SET EVER AGAIN. OR AT LEAST UNTIL THEY SERVE DINNER. THIS IS CRAZY. I CANNOT BELIEVE WE'RE GONNA BE ON THE COVER OF ROLLING STONE. THAT'S, LIKE, FOR SUPER-FAMOUS PEOPLE, LIKE U2 OR THE SPIN DOCTORS. I MEAN, THIS IS CRAZY! WHAT'S CRAZY IS THAT I CAN'T EVEN DO MY OWN GROCERY SHOPPING ANYMORE. I GOT ABSOLUTELY MOBBED AT GELSON'S YESTERDAY. HEATHER, YOU'VE HAD TO DO THIS SO MUCH LONGER THAN WE HAVE. WHAT DO YOU DO? JUST LOOK AMAZING WHENEVER YOU RUN ERRANDS! HOW ABOUT THIS SIMPLE TANK? - YEAH! - HMM? THIS SHOULD WORK. SERIOUSLY? I'LL GO TRY IT ON. SHE'S JUST LOOKING OUT FOR HER CLIENT, I GUESS. OH, NO, WHAT'S WRONG? IT'S JUST... ALL THE GIRLS LOOK SO GREAT. AND SO DO YOU! I DON'T HAVE ANY BOOBS. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE USE A ZOOM LENS ON ME. OH, HONEY, BOOBS ARE SO 1993. LOOK AT KATE MOSS. UGH, I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE STAYS SO THIN. SHE MUST WORK OUT ALL THE TIME. DON'T WORRY ABOUT HER. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING. YOU'RE PERFECT. HEATHER, HONEY. YOU LOOK AMAZING. GREAT CHOICE. YEAH. IT LOOKS GOOD. EVERYBODY GET IN CLOSE, I WANT YOU TO DRAPE YOURSELVES OVER EACH OTHER. NO, LEAVE THEM OPEN. MAYBE WE'LL MAKE THE COVER OF ROLLING STONE AND PENTHOUSE. NO SMILING. I WANT SEXY. UH, HEY, COURTNEY. COULD YOU SWITCH PLACES WITH LAURA? I DON'T WANT ALL THE BLONDES IN THE SAME SPOT. OH, THAT IS PERFECT. DOUG, I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE... I'M DONE, HUH? WHA...? NO. NO, THIS IS GOOD NEWS. YOUR CHARACTER FINALLY GETS TO KISS ANOTHER GUY. ARE YOU SERIOUS? MM-HMM. THIS IS... THIS IS GREAT! HEY, DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ASK ME IF I'M EVER GONNA GET LAID ON THIS SHOW? DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ASK ME? DARREN, I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP FOR THE GAY COMMUNITY. THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. YEAH, WELL, MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT'S THE RIGHT TO DO FOR THE SHOW. NOW, THE NETWORK WILL ALWAYS BE A LITTLE SKITTISH, BUT... IT'S TIME. OH, OH, OH... OH, HEY, HOT-LIPS! DON'T BE JEALOUS. A LITTLE BIT! GO GET 'EM, TIGER. TV-KISSING 101... ALWAYS HAVE FRESH BREATH. AND LIP BALM, IN CASE THERE'S MULTIPLE TAKES, WHICH THERE WILL BE. THANKS A LOT, GUYS. YOU NERVOUS? YES. YOU'RE GONNA BE A PART OF HISTORY, MAN. YOU GUYS ARE STAYING TO WATCH, AREN'T YOU? OH, GOD, YES. OKAY. LET'S PRACTICE THIS ONE MORE TIME. AND STAND-INS, KISS. AND HEADLIGHTS. OKAY, LET'S GET THE STAND-INS OUT, LET'S GET FIRST TEAM IN. OKAY, EVERYBODY, NO REHEARSAL. LET'S GO FOR ONE. WE'RE GONNA ROLL AND TAIL-SLATE IT. AND... ACTION. I HAD A GREAT TIME TONIGHT. ME TOO. AND HEADLIGHTS! - AND CUT! - TAIL SLATE. IT'S GONNA BE THE KISS HEARD AROUND THE WORLD. YOUR PACKAGE IS... THANK YOU. OH, MY GOD! THE COVER OF "ROLLING STONE," LADIES. WHERE ARE WE? THANK YOU. "THE HOT ISSUE!" WE LOOK SEXY. WE DO. OH, IT IS HOT! "THE BOD SQUAD." WELL, I GUESS THEY DIDN'T HAVE ROOM ON THE COVER. APPARENTLY, IT'S RESERVED FOR BARBARA'S CLIENTS. WE'RE IN THE SAME ISSUE AS THE MEAT PUPPETS. THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE. BARBARA? IT'S LAURA LEIGHTON ON LINE ONE. ISN'T THE ROLLING STONE COVER PHENOMENAL? ACTUALLY... EVERYONE'S UPSET OVER HERE BECAUSE COURTNEY AND DAPHNE WERE LEFT OFF THE COVER. WERE THEY? I ONLY NOTICED WHO WAS ON IT. YOU. THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH ROOM ON A PAGE. WHY ARE YOU UPSET? YOU MADE THE CUT. BECAUSE THIS CAST IS LIKE FAMILY, THAT'S WHY. SURE, BUT SHOWS COME AND GO. MAGAZINE COVERS ARE FOREVER, AND YOU'RE ON ONE. YOU DON'T GET IT. WE'RE WITH EACH OTHER EVERY DAY, 12 HOURS A DAY, AND WHEN YOU PULL STUFF LIKE THIS, IT MAKES IT... ENOUGH ALREADY. IT'S JUST BUSINESS. BARBARA, I'M SERIOUS. I DON'T THINK... THERE'LL BE OTHER COVERS. I DON'T KNOW. UM... GOOD HOUSEKEEPING OR SOMETHING. MAYBE THEY CAN BE ON ONE OF THOSE, IF IT MAKES THEM HAPPY. LISTEN, DOLL, I GOT TO RUN. BIG KISSES. I THINK IT LOOKS GREAT ON YOU. THERE IT IS. - HERE YOU GO. - SIGNATURE. SEE YOU LATER. YOUR CHARACTER IS THE SWEETEST PERSON ON THE SHOW. OH, I KNOW. EVERYBODY ELSE ALWAYS GETS TO HAVE THE FUN. EXCEPT FOR THE POOL FIGHT WITH SYDNEY... THAT WAS AWESOME. THANK YOU! YEAH, I HOPE I GET TO DO MORE THINGS LIKE THAT. THEY SHOULD LET YOU PUSH MICHAEL INTO THE POOL. WELL, AFTER WHAT MICHAEL DID TO MY CHARACTER, THEY SHOULD LET ME PUSH HIM OFF A CLIFF. WE DON'T NORMALLY COME HERE, BUT WE HEARD YOU'D BE HERE TONIGHT. AND WE'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR FINALLY PORTRAYING A GAY MAN ON TV THAT'S NOT A STEREOTYPE. YOU'RE WELCOME. THAT'S REALLY NICE OF YOU TO SAY. THANKS FOR SHOWING UP. I SAW YOU DID THE A.I.D.S. RIDE. IT'S SO GOOD TO HAVE HIGH-PROFILE CELEBRITIES STANDING UP FOR THE CAUSE. WELL, I'M NO ELIZABETH TAYLOR. YOU'RE REALLY BRAVE! IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD. NAH. THE ONLY HARD PART WAS THE OTHER GUY'S 5:00 SHADOW. VERY SCRATCHY. I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH HIM. PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEATS. THE SHOW IS ABOUT TO START. AND NOW, BACK TO MELROSE PLACE. GET READY TO MAKE TV HISTORY. I HAD A GREAT TIME TONIGHT. ME TOO. THEY CUT THE KISS. AFTER ALL THAT... COME ON, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY CUT THE KISS. INTO THE NETWORK WITH THE KISS, I HANDED BUT WE ALL KNEW IT WASN'T A SURE THING. THEY GET FINAL CUT, NOT US. THEY COULD'VE AT LEAST LET US KNOW THEY WERE GONNA CUT IT, SO THAT WE COULD'VE FOUGHT FOR IT. YOU COULD'VE FOUGHT FOR IT. HEY, I FIGHT FOR THIS SHOW EVERY WEEK. YOU FIGHT FOR RATINGS AND CLEAVAGE. THIS WAS ABOUT SOMETHING MORE. YOU KNOW THAT. OF COURSE I DO. THEN WHY DO I FEEL LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT SEEMS TO CARE? HI, IT'S BARBARA. I GOT THE SCRIPTS, AND I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT THEM. DID YOU READ THEM? YEAH. SOME OF THEM ARE BARELY IN ENGLISH. I'VE SEEN BETTER WRITING ON BATHROOM WALLS. THOSE ARE HOT PROJECTS RIGHT NOW. WELL, THAT'S DEPRESSING. AND IT'S NOT THE KIND OF MATERIAL I'M INTERESTED IN. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. I WANT TO DO MOVIES THAT SAY SOMETHING. WELL, NO ONE IS INTERESTED IN MAKING ISSUE PICTURES RIGHT NOW. SO, I DON'T KNOW, WHY NOT DO SOME WHERE YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY FROM AN EXPLOSION IN SLOW-MO? AND IF THEY'RE HITS, YOU CAN DO WHATEVER ARTSY JUNK YOU WANT. OKAY? OKAY. WELL, THANKS. BYE. OKAY, LET'S SEE IT. SO AFTER MARCIA PULLS HER WIG OFF... THIS IS WHAT WE SEE. WHAT IS THIS? KIMBERLY WAS IN A CAR CRASH AND A COMA. SHE'S BASICALLY RISEN FROM THE DEAD. THIS LOOKS LIKE SHE GRAZED A TREE BRANCH. I ASSURE YOU THIS SCAR IS VERY ACCURATE. THIS IS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE IN REAL LIFE. WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT REAL LIFE? THIS IS MELROSE PLACE. I THINK WE SHOULD START BREAKING STORYLINES FOR NEXT SEASON. YOU WANNA WAIT FOR A RENEWAL, OR...? MM. I'M A PLANNER. - OH! - AH. SHOW US. THAT LOOKS GOOD. IT'S... CUTE. YOU UNDERSTAND TELEVISION'S A VISUAL MEDIUM, RIGHT? I'M SORRY, WAS THAT A TRICK QUESTION, OR...? LET'S MAKE IT BIGGER. YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT. BIGGER IS BETTER. SO I'VE HEARD. I LIKE 'EM BOTH. HEATHER, WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE? - LET'S DO THIS. - OKAY. YEAH. YOU LOOK GOOD IN ANYTHING. WHOA... THAT'S A SCAR! LET'S MAKE IT TWICE AS WIDE, AND WE'RE IN BUSINESS. DON'T WORRY. WE WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO YOU. THANK GOD! BUT KIMBERLY SHAW... NOW, THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY. - OH, MY GOD! - UGH, GROSS! I THINK I'M GONNA HURL. GABLE? SILVERMAN? BIGGEST RATINGS SO FAR! NICE! AUDIENCE GOES CRAZY! YOU KNOW WHAT? I GIVE UP. LET'S JUST GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT. GO CRAZY. NO, NO, NO! THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS. COME ON, LOOK AT ME... WHAT'S UP? WHOA! MATT GET GAY-BASHED AGAIN? KIMBERLY HIRED SOME GOONS. WHAT'S NEXT? HO, HO. DANCE PARTY. YOU KNOW, THERE'S, LIKE, A DANCE-OFF. DANCE OFF. THEN MATT SHOCKS EVERYONE AND COMES OUT AS STRAIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT! WOULDN'T THAT BE AWKWARD FOR EVERYBODY? OH, A MYSTERIOUS OLDER WOMAN ARRIVES, BUT SHE'S BILLY'S ACTUAL MOTHER. - THAT'S RIGHT. - AND... ...HIS FATHER. RIGHT? WHO'S DONE THAT BEFORE? NOBODY! NOBODY! JUST US. LOOK AT THAT HUGE BELLY. I HOPE NOBODY TRIES TO STEAL MY BABY. WHO WOULD DO SUCH A THING? DID YOU SEE THAT? AMANDA AND KIMBERLY ADOPT THE SAME CHILD FROM AFRICA. FROM AFRICA! CATFIGHT. "WHOOPS! DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING." OH. THAT'S SOME OUTFIT YOU'VE GOT THERE. I KNOW. I WAS AFRAID IT WASN'T GONNA BE TASTEFUL... BUT THANK GOD. I WISH I GOT TO BE A HOOKER. I KNOW. IT'S EVERY GIRL'S DREAM. SO WE DO A FULL RENOVATION OF MELROSE PLACE, AND WHEN THEY KNOCK DOWN THE WALLS... BOOM! EVIL SPIRITS! HEY, HEY. CHECK IT OUT. I WISH I COULD GET SHOT. I KNOW. MAYBE NEXT SEASON. DOUG AND BILLY ARE PLAYING TENNIS, AND IT'S ALL INNOCENT UNTIL DOUG WHIPS THE RACKET AND KILLS BILLY ON THE COURT. JUST... DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT... BUT IT'S LIKE A DRIVE-BY. "GAME, SET, MATCH" IS WHAT WE CALL IT. IS IT JUST ME, OR DOES MY CANCER MAKE-UP LOOK JUST LIKE YOUR HANGOVER MAKE-UP? IT DOES, BUT YOU'RE STILL THE SEXIEST CHEMO PATIENT I'VE EVER SEEN. THAT'S BECAUSE I'M A BITCH, AND BITCHES STAY SEXY! SO, KIMBERLY TIES SYDNEY TO A PLANE AND CRASHES IT INTO MELROSE PLACE. - IT'S GENIUS. - GENIUS. WE'LL NEVER THINK OF A CRAZIER FINALE. WE NEED TO THINK OF ANOTHER FINALE. YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME! WHAT ARE THE ODDS? WE GOT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE. SERIOUSLY? WE'VE ALREADY HAD A HITWOMAN TRY AND BLOW JAKE UP ON A BOAT, A DRUG DEALER TRY AND KILL JO ON A BOAT. PETER TRY AND GIVE AMANDA A LOBOTOMY. KIMBERLY RUN OVER MICHAEL WITH A CAR... DON'T FORGET SYDNEY ABDUCTED BY A CULT. RIGHT! SO WE CAME UP WITH ALL THAT STUFF, THERE SHOULD BE MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM. SYDNEY COULD BE ABDUCTED BY A CULT... ...ON A BOAT. OR, YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE'S ALWAYS PLUMBING PROBLEMS AT MELROSE PLACE. RIGHT? KIMBERLY COULD POISON THE WATER SUPPLY. NOT VISUAL ENOUGH. WHAT IF WE FILLED THE POOL WITH ACID AND PUSHED EVERYBODY IN? OH! THAT'S GOOD. OR, UH, PIRANHAS. I MEAN, THAT WOULD BE A GREAT VISUAL. DO WE WANT THAT MANY PIRANHAS ON ACID? THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. YOU KNOW, AS EVERYONE'S JUMPING IN? GUYS, THAT'S OVER-THE-TOP, EVEN FOR US. I NEED YOU TO FOCUS. NEW SEASON FINALE. SOMETHING AS CRAZY AS A PLANE FLYING INTO THE COMPLEX, BUT NOT AS CRAZY AS DEATH BY PIRANHAS. LET'S SHOOT FOR SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE. I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE. NO WORRIES. TRAFFIC IS AWFUL. I COULD'VE WALKED HERE FASTER. WHO AM I KIDDING? NOT IN THESE SHOES. SO WHAT'S UP? YOU SOUNDED SO SERIOUS ON THE PHONE, WHICH IS SO NOT LIKE YOU. THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT TRUE. I CAN BE VERY SERIOUS SOMETIMES. OH. WELL... NOTED. WHEN WE FIRST MET, I HAD JUST STARTED ON A HIT SHOW WITH ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE. YOU HELPED ME NAVIGATE THROUGH SITUATIONS THAT CAME ALONG WITH THAT. BUT... WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING BUSINESS. AND, UH, WE DON'T SEEM TO COMMUNICATE. ARE YOU FIRING ME? I HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR YOU... I DIDN'T ASK IF YOU RESPECTED ME. I'M SUGGESTING WE PART WAYS PROFESSIONALLY. IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL. IT'S JUST LIKE YOU SAID, IT'S "SHOW BUSINESS," NOT "SHOW FRIENDS." HMM. WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE... YOU'RE BUYING LUNCH. AND I'M HAVING THE LOBSTER. NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT. THE IRONY IS I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE RESPECTED YOU MORE HAD YOU SAID IT. LOOKS GREAT. WAIT TILL YOU HEAR WHAT WE HAVE PLANNED FOR THE SEASON FINALE. I WANT TO HEAR IT, BUT FIRST I WANT TO HEAR THE STORY IDEAS FOR THE MODELS, INC. SPIN-OFF WE TALKED ABOUT. I DON'T KNOW... A SPIN-OFF OF A SPIN-OFF? OUR AUDIENCE MIGHT GET DIZZY. DON'T LOOK AT IT THAT WAY. I LOVE 90210. I LOVE MELROSE PLACE, BUT I'VE TOLD YOU... I WANT TO BRANCH OUT. THIS IS BRANCHING OUT! THE FASHION WORLD IS CUT-THROAT. THERE ARE SO MANY STORIES THERE. I'M SURE THERE ARE, BUT I FEEL LIKE IT'S ALL IN THE SAME INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL WHEELHOUSE. IT'LL BE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. YES, THOSE CHARACTERS WILL BE SEXY, BUT YOU CAN DECIDE HOW AND WHY THEY'RE SEXY. IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. EXACTLY. SO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING! I DO, BUT... THIS IDEA IS A WINNER, DARREN. I WAS RIGHT ABOUT MELROSE, WASN'T I? WE BROUGHT HEATHER ON, MADE IT A NIGHT-TIME SOAP, AND IT'S A HUGE, HUGE HIT. WELL, THIS WILL BE, TOO. I'M SURE IT WILL BE, I JUST... MAYBE I NEED SOME MORE TIME TO THINK IT THROUGH. WE'RE ON A SCHEDULE. I KNOW. I'LL TALK TO YOU TOMORROW. FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. UH-HUH. YOU NEED HELP? NAH, I'M JUST CLEANING OUT THE TRAILER. I CANNOT WAIT FOR HIATUS. ONLY ONE MORE WEEK. YOU GOT ANY BIG PLANS? OF COURSE. YOUR FOUNDATION. AND IF YOU GOT SOME EXTRA TIME, WE COULD USE THE HELP. SURE! BUT I WANT A T-SHIRT. YOU JUST WATCH. IT IS GONNA GO WORLDWIDE SOMEDAY. I THINK MY FAVORITE PART ABOUT THIS WHOLE CELEBRITY THING IS USING IT FOR CAUSES I CARE ABOUT. YOU REALIZE WE JUST SOUNDED LIKE A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT, RIGHT? YEAH, WE DID, DIDN'T WE? COME ON, LET'S GO GET PLASTIC SURGERY AND ADOPT A FEW ETHNIC BABIES. NEW YORK! AARON, IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN, YOU'RE GOING TO NEW YORK? NOT RIGHT AWAY, BUT WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS. I TOLD YOU, THAT IF CBS PICKED UP CENTRAL PARK WEST, I WOULD HAVE TO HEAD OVER THERE. WHAT IS THIS ABOUT? YOU STILL STUCK ON MAKING "IMPORTANT" TELEVISION? YOU WANT TO REINVENT THE WHEEL? HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED THE WHEEL IS FINE THE WAY IT IS? I'M NOT TRYING TO REINVENT ANYTHING... YOU'VE TAUGHT ME ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT. I JUST WANT TO SEE IF I CAN BUILD A BETTER WHEEL ON MY OWN. BESIDES, I CAN STILL CONSULT ON 90210 AND MELROSE PLACE. I GIVE PEOPLE THE SHOES AND THEY USE THEM TO WALK AWAY. AARON, I HAVE SPENT MANY YEARS WITH YOU, AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LOYAL. I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE. YOU, MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE, SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY UPSET. I'M GONNA TAKE OFF. HOPEFULLY, WE CAN TALK IN THE MORNING. HOW'D IT GO? I WAS RIGHT. HE'S LEAVING. DARREN'S ALWAYS BEEN IN MY CORNER, BUT HE HAS NO CLUE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO CLIMB INTO THE RING WITH ME. SO YOU FIRED BARBARA? WOW. WASN'T THAT BAD. IT WAS A GOOD LESSON FOR ME, STANDING UP FOR MYSELF. YOU'VE LEARNED A LOT SINCE YOUR FIRST DAY ON SET, HUH? LIKE, HOPEFULLY HOW TO SMOKE A PROP CIGARETTE. OH, MY GOD! DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? YEAH. WHOEVER SAID SMOKING CIGARETTES MAKES YOU LOOK COOL NEVER SAW YOU ALMOST SWALLOW ONE. IT'S, UM, IT'S GONNA BE ANOTHER HALF HOUR OR SO, GUYS, IF YOU GUYS WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR TRAILERS. I CAN HANG OUT? WE'LL HANG OUT. SO HOW'S EVERYTHING BEEN GOING? I KNOW THINGS HAVE BEEN... TOUGH? YEAH. DIVORCE IS... IT'S... IT SUCKS. BUT WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP EVERYTHING AS POSITIVE AS WE CAN. FOR THE GIRLS. THEY'RE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN ALL THIS, YOU KNOW? YOU'RE A GOOD GUY, YOU KNOW THAT? I'M JUST DOING THE BEST I CAN... LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. LIKE YOU. I KNOW IT CAN'T BE EASY, BREAKING UP WITH SOMEONE THAT YOU WORK WITH AND HAVE TO SEE EVERY DAY. I KNOW IT'S FOR THE BEST. GRANT AND I, WE JUST... WE WEREN'T RIGHT FOR EACH OTHER. YEAH. BREAK-UPS ARE COMPLICATED. OR SO I'VE HEARD. MY CHARACTER HASN'T GOTTEN PAST THE HAND-HOLDING STAGE OF A RELATIONSHIP. WOW. THOSE ARE A LOT OF CANNONS. I MEAN, I WANT IT TO BE REAL, BUT IT'S GOT TO BE SAFE. IT'LL BE SAFE, BUT WHENEVER YOU HAVE THIS MANY PYROTECHNICS, THERE'S ALWAYS A RISK. EXACTLY HOW MUCH RISK? I'M NOT PUTTING ANY OF MY PEOPLE IN DANGER. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW TIRED I AM OF HIRING NEW ACTORS. DON'T WORRY. THIS IS THE BEST CREW IN HOLLYWOOD. WE'VE HAD BIGGER EXPLOSIONS WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A SINGED EYEBROW. I'M SURE YOU HAVE, BUT IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG, IT'S GONNA BE THE MOST EXPENSIVE COOKOUT IN TV HISTORY. WELL, THAT'S A LOT OF GAS LINE THEY'RE LAYING. I'M AN EXTREMELY THOROUGH PSYCHOPATH. YOUR CHARACTER IS A NUT JOB. I BET WHEN YOU SIGNED ON FOR THIS, YOU HAD NO IDEA SHE'D GET THIS CRAZY. I CERTAINLY DIDN'T. AND YET YOU PLAY HER WITHOUT MAKING HER A-A CARTOON CHARACTER. HOW? I JUST PLAY HER AS IF I WERE READING SHAKESPEARE. WHEN KIMBERLY STARTED, SHE WAS SOMEONE WITH A CONSCIENCE, A LONELY DOCTOR, WHO FELL IN LOVE WITH A MARRIED MAN. THEN SHE GOT THE HEAD INJURY, AND, WELL... TSK. I LIKE TO THINK SHE'S A GOOD PERSON, THERE'S JUST SOMETHING PRESSING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HER BRAIN. IT'S A TESTAMENT TO YOUR ACTING, BECAUSE THESE SCRIPTS ARE NOT EXACTLY SHAKESPEARE. NO, BUT HOW GOOD WOULD THOSE PLAYS HAVE BEEN IF HE HAD TO WRITE 32 OF THEM A YEAR? GIVEN THAT, THERE ARE SOME GREAT TWISTS. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S NEVER DULL AROUND HERE, THAT'S FOR SURE. - RIGHT? - NO. BEST CREW IN HOLLYWOOD, HUH? IT'S FINE. IT'S JUST A FLASH TEST. THAT WINDOW'S GONNA BLOW OUT. THAT DOOR IS GONNA COME OFF ITS FRAME. FLAMES SHOOTING OUT, AND THE WHOLE THING'S GONNA COME DOWN. KIMBERLY'S GONNA LEAP INTO THE POOL. DEBRIS IS GONNA FALL. "IS SHE ALL RIGHT?" WE DON'T KNOW. THEY HAVE ONE SHOT AT THIS. IT'S THE BEST CREW. THIS IS WHERE YOU BLOW UP YOUR NETWORK EXEC. YOU'LL BE FINE! DON'T WORRY. EVERYTHING IS AS SAFE AS CAN BE. OH, MY GOSH! WITH ALL THESE EXPLOSIONS AND FLASH TESTS, I'M GONNA BE A NERVOUS WRECK! I KNOW. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS MANY PEOPLE ON OUR SET BEFORE? NO. I JUST HOPE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. ONE MISSED MARK AND SOMEONE IS GONNA END UP IN THE HOSPITAL. I THINK THAT'S WHY ALL THE FIREMEN ARE HERE. AND TO BE HONEST, I WOULDN'T MIND A LITTLE MOUTH-TO-MOUTH IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG. LOOK AT THE CREW HOLDING ALL THAT PROP DEBRIS THEY GET TO THROW AT US DURING THE EXPLOSION. OH, GREAT. LOOKS LIKE PAYBACK TIME. YEAH, THEY SEEM A LITTLE TOO EXCITED ABOUT IT. ANYWAY, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS. I'M TELLING YOU, THEY HAVE ONE SHOT AT THIS. ALL RIGHT, I NEED EVERYBODY ON POINT AND PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION. PLEASE STAY ON YOUR MARKS AND DO NOT MISS YOUR CUES. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I'M GOING TO DIE WITHOUT WINNING A TONY. HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE! ACTORS READY? PYROTECHNICS READY? READY! AND ROLL CAMERA. SLATE IT. HEY, CAN I GET A LITTLE MORE QUIET ON THE SET, PLEASE? QUIET ON SET! QUIET! ON MY CALL. ACTION. OKAY. CUT. CUT! IS EVERYBODY OKAY? CUT THE FIRE. COMING AT IT. EXTINGUISHERS FLYING IN. THAT WAS FUN. MARCIA? MARCIA! MARCIA! OH, MY GOD! MARCIA! MARCIA! COME HERE, COME HERE. PLEASE TELL ME WE GOT IT? WE GOT IT. EVERYBODY'S OKAY. - WHOO! - YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN. GOOD JOB! NICE. COME ON. LET'S GET YOU OUTTA HERE. THATTA GIRL. IT'S OVER. RECENTLY, YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA BE WRITTEN OFF THIS SHOW? HEY, THEY STILL COULD. KIMBERLY MIGHT NOT COME OUT OF THAT POOL ALIVE. SOMETHING TELLS ME KIMBERLY CAN HOLD HER BREATH JUST AS LONG AS YOU CAN. YOU WERE TERRIFIC. YOU ALL WERE! WONDERFUL JOB, EVERYBODY. THIS WAS FANTASTIC. OUR FANS ARE GONNA LOVE THIS. I THINK WE CAN TRULY SAY WE MADE SOMETHING UNFORGETTABLE. WONDERFUL JOB. WONDERFUL. THANK YOU! WONDERFUL. LAURA, FANTASTIC. OKAY, LET'S GET THIS LOCKED UP FOR CLOSE-UPS. LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL. I'M GOING TO TAKE OFF. REALLY? WE ONLY GOT A COUPLE MORE SHOTS AND WE'RE DONE. YEAH, I KNOW. I'LL SEE EVERYBODY AT THE WRAP PARTY, THOUGH, THIS WEEKEND. ONE TAKE! ONE TAKE! FABULOUS. FABULOUS! YOU DESERVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH, IT'S JUST, UH... IT'S JUST ALL THE SMOKE.
