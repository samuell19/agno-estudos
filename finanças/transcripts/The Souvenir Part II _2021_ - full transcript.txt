My period's late. Hello. Can I come in? Hello. - Here we are. - Hello. There's a nice little scene. Dogs waiting for lunch. Ah. You had any rest? Poor old you. What a shock. Terrible shock. Sorry. Did you know what was going on with this chap? What's wrong with that? You're the boss. Is she coming? Darling? Here we go. - You ready for this? - Hello. I like the pajamas. - They're not pajamas. - Oh. Well, they're very nice anyway. What are you doing? Oi, stop it. They want to go for a walk. That's what they're doing. Help yourself. Hello there. I hope you're gonna stay for a very long time. Long as possible, my darling. Absolutely. You want some? ♪ Will there be another time ♪ Will there be another time ♪ Another year ♪ Another wish to stay? ♪ Will there be another time ♪ Will there be another time ♪ Another year ♪ Another wish to stay? ♪ You grow green grass above me... ...with showers and dew drops wed. And if thou wilt remember, and if thou wilt forget. Marland... We've got it, we've got it. Just... Just come round to Julie at the moment. She's going to be explaining it as we go over the... I think we'll... Thank you for coming to see us. I brought you the last of his things. Oh... I mean, you know, I'm just reading this book. Um... Jack Pincher book and, you know, all these people that have led double lives. And, you know, I... You know, I'm just hoping that I can find a reference to a friend of his or something in there that will give me a little hope that... That there is some involvement at the foreign office. I mean, it would... I can't seem to find out anywhere in the foreign office to talk to even, you know. I mean, he was... He didn't talk to us about his work, did he? Was he worrying about anything, do you know? No? No. James had to identify him. It just... It just didn't look like him. I... I... I found it very hard to accept that it was him. There's a little present for you. He looks exactly the same. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. - Hello, Julie? - Yes. - Do come in. - Thank you. Seems to me he was quite dark in his nature anyway. Uh, I would wager that you two had more disagreements than you had had for the period of time. Let's go six months back. You'd had more disagreements. Not necessarily battles royal, but disagreements. And in that time, while he was struggling, he was working on a thought. A conscious thought that he didn't know how to go forward with life in this deception that had become his life. Uh, and as I'm sitting here talking to you, the way I'm getting this information without invading anybody's privacy is I'm asking myself, what do I know about his last days? What happened to his moods? Did he have a reason to go on at all? And I have the sense that at the end, he had no reason to go on. He wanted to stop what was going on in his own life, so he just did that. He let his life go. Action background! Yeah. Just a rehearsal. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... One... - Yeah, there's a... - Graham... ...you know, there's a challenge in that. Um... But also, it's just trying to find a character that, you know, is layered. Um, and... It's not necessarily about the darkness, it's about why this person is the way he is. You could say that it's also a very political film. - Yes. Yeah. - Right. Okay, I just... Uh, pause for a minute. Just to check something on the camera. Julie's here. Hi, Julie. Carry on. I don't wanna... - Sorry. - It's okay. Good to see you! Good to see you. - Great! - Uh, Julie, Jim. - Hi. Jim. - Hello. Julie. - We've met before. - Nice to meet you. Oh, really? Um... Knightsbridge. Um, it was brief. Um... Sorry about your loss. Thank you. I, um... I'd met Anthony a few times, and, uh, he had a beautiful mind. He did. Julie, ready? Be careful of all these cables, okay? - Okay... - Thank you. One, two, three, four... Okay, lets hold it there. Cut! Cut! Cut! Okay, good. Let's get it in pieces now. Jim, it's not linear. Jim, it's... It's not linear, in terms of the action... No, but I'm just getting marking... ...so you don't need to repeat it. And I look like a... I look like a fucking idiot. Just a minute to reload. So, guys, just a minute while we reload camera. Is there any chance of getting, say, another half dozen people around this monitor? Okay, stand by. Each shot we can use. Even if it's not the same. As long as you have the same emotion. And roll playback... And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Again! Up, up... Look at him. Okay, coming back. Five, six, seven, eight... One... Continuing on after the fixed point. And now come back. Come back. Just straight back, straight back. Right. I wanted to ask you why you decided to do a musical today. Look at us. We're in the pissing rain. Wouldn't you want to be on a sound stage in widescreen, rather than here like every other fucking English film ever made where it's drizzling? That's why. You know, to... To show the kids some kind of life. To use the form, to use movement, music, montage, rather than... Blegh... That's why. Right. Um... Would you say it's a political musical? Everything's political. Everything's political. Right. Done. You can see it's not a good time. - Sorry. - Yeah. - We'll wait. It's fine. - No. It's broken now. - Can I just have five minutes? - Go on. I just wanted to ask you a few questions about Anthony - and his work. - Bad time. It's a bad time. You can go. Lydia, could you... Could you... Make a memorial for him. Well, then, also to imagine that Black men are sort of like some sort of animals. Then we see this girl, and suddenly we're like, we turn into... Like lunatics and we're just, like, obsessed with a woman. Yeah, the White guys are the same though. Yeah, but it's... Yeah, but I dunno... For me... It's more about the question, I think, and, uh... Yeah, the colors of the costume as well. They look like cartoon characters. But you wanna contribute to cinema, right? You wanna be something... I think... I really think he is contributing to cinema. He is. Yeah, he's contributing shit, is what he's contributing. Let's be real about it... I like when you're like that. - Yeah, me, too. - I'm just being honest. That bit of feistiness. I've bitten my tongue for that entire day. - I was laughing. - Oh, yeah? I was laughing along. I thought... I said... I thought the commentary was good, but I just... It's just one of them jobs that you've gotta look after yourself. It's a trial by fire, mate. That's what it is. Julie, have you had a look at it? Have you seen any of the rushes? - Yeah, a little bit. - Yeah? - What do you think? - Good. It looks good. It's just taking a bit of time. Patrick's a bit hard work. He's giving him a load of grief. You guys are not very happy, though. - Pardon? - You're not very happy. Yeah, I can see it, man. That's just how it goes, innit? No, it's just stressful, innit? It's got like... He's... We were saying earlier, he's got this very romanticized idea of what he wants without sort of a proper sort of direction of how to achieve it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Mmm. Yeah, we could get the sense of that. But it's coming, it's trickling down to us because obviously, he's not getting the shots that he wants. But when you're the people in front of the camera, you feel like you're the ones fucking up all the time. Mmm. Mmm. And more so on Jim, bless him. Keeps taking him aside and... Pulling him aside, having chats with him on his own and that... Two minutes we're stood down, you know what I mean? Hello. Can I come in? I was in the area. Are you okay? Are you sure? Stop. I'm on my period. I don't mind. Thank you. Uh, Garance, the shoes. Oui. Okay. - We've got time. - Okay. We've got time because I'm very fast. You are very fast. Yeah, and again. Okay, watch out. - Yeah. - Ca va? Come on, guys. Let's go. - How much of the car... - Mmm? How much of the car do you want... Do you wanna get a mark on the start as well? I... I want to be like... No, no, I know. Oh, notorious. Okay, perfect. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rehearsal, rehearsal. You're doubting yourself. I don't like it and I won't let you do it. I won't let you do it! I've seen you. I've seen what you can do. You have too much faith in me. I always say this! I always say this. It's... Yeah, but it's not... It's not grounded, like, in... In something false. It's, you know... You are! You're like... I think you've... You're a bright mind. You always have intelligent ideas. You always have an interesting perspective on things, you know. Yeah, but it's not, you know, um, alien fighting, sexy, like... Right, yeah. It's not... It's not... - It's not a futuristic film. - No. Yeah, but that... Does it have to be? Does it have to be to be interesting? No, but it has to be as... No, it doesn't have to be. But it just has to be something that people are not gonna forget as soon as they... You know, as soon as the credits roll. Right, but I just think, you know, that's going the outside in. I think focus on what you wanna do. What you wanna make for yourself. And if you're happy with it, you know... Yeah, but... Yeah, but you know what I'm saying. If you're happy with it and you've put your heart into it, then it will work out. But if you're thinking about, "Oh, well, I hope it's impressive "and I hope, you know, "it will be as good as Garance's film, and it's..." You don't need that, you don't need that. You just think about what makes you happy, what works for you, what you're interested in. And it will translate, I think. Oh. To your right, darling. Ooh! Who are you? Julie. Have a seat. I was, uh, Anthony Reeves' girlfriend. Wait a minute. I'm gonna check something. Your skin is very soft. You're pretty. Anthony has really good taste. I mean, he used to have good taste. He gave me this. His present. But sometimes it doesn't work. Sometimes I have to ask Stephen for help. Can I have your lighter, please? No. Did he come here before he died? I mean, the day. Why? I just didn't know what he did in that time. Because I left and... He was by himself for an afternoon, and I didn't know what he did, so... I'm very cut up about what happened to Anthony. Almost destroyed me. He was very special. I know how you feel. ♪ I've often thought about ♪ The men where I came from ♪ And times ago ♪ Their sons, these days are found ♪ In US and ♪ Britannia care ♪ - Excellent, Lee. Thank you. - No problem. I'll go and find the sign. Change that. Just that one to do and we're there. Mmm. This is, uh, going to be probably the most important thing you do at film school. This is your graduation film. And of course you came with a great deal of powerful images and images of Sunderland, that idea for a story in Sunderland. And there was an engagement with... With life, with... With people's lives. And although it was unformed, it was early as a filmmaker and although we could sense that there were other things in you at that time that needed to develop, uh, I can't connect it with this script that I have in front of me now. These images... These characters don't seem to relate to you. I mean, what... What has changed? Where... What is going on? What has happened to produce this new... Where's, where has that other world gone, that Sunderland world? I don't wanna show life as it plays out in real time. I wanna show life as I imagine it. That's what cinema's all about. So what are you telling the audience with these images? It's about a relationship in a fairy tale, in a fantasy, that hopefully, many people can relate to in their own way. We want to encourage innovation, young filmmakers to find their own voices. But we also want to encourage professional practice and I look at this and I don't see anything that resembles what I think of as a professional script. Can I ask what you consider to be a professional script? Well, I'll leave aside the red bow, but at this stage, a title, although you then rather archly have a subtitle, "Art Is Life." But there are no scene headings. So... So are we now discussing the layout of the script as a reason? The layout captures the precision with which you're thinking about your project. It's very unclear how you're helping your collaborators find their way through your proposed set of images. What it is you're trying to... To photograph. And then behind that, I think our deeper concern is that there's also a lack of precision about your thinking. What your intentions are. What you're hoping to express and to explore here. I'm sorry, Julie, but... If you pursue this film as you present it to us now, I'm afraid the school cannot support you and will not support you. Is it... Presumably, there's a technician who takes the... Who actually takes the film things, is it? Well, no, not really. I mean, yeah, there's store cupboards and people that look after... No, no. But I mean the person behind the camera is a... Is an expert, are they? No! Absolutely not, they're students. - They're all students. - They're all students? Yes. The whole team is students. And no one's giving you direction? No. Well, me. I'm the director. No, no, I don't mean the director. But no one's telling you how to do it? No. Sounds fairly typical for an art school. Better come and work on the farm for a bit. But it's exciting. I mean, you're pulling together and helping each other on all your own projects, aren't you? So you'll help somebody else with their film and... Mm-hmm. - Well, exciting. Mmm. - So is the script done? - Mm-hmm. And do we know what the script's about? Can we put... I actually really don't wanna talk - about it anymore. - Darling... We're trying to get it, but, um... I know you are. It's just... It's very irritating for me having to explain it a thousand times. We don't mean to be irritating. We're just very excited and interested. Don't be irritated. But anyhow, we're looking forward to it. No, thanks. No, I've given up sugar. - You've given up sugar? - Yeah. Didn't think that would ever happen. You've missed the significance though, of the pot. That's Mummy's first artefact. Do you mean you made it? I'm very proud of it. - It's very good. - You should be. The top's a bit wonky. It doesn't really fit, but... I think it's great. Early Etruscan handles. What are... Are these... That's so sweet of you to say that. Yes, well I thought... They're a bit in the way, aren't they? I'm glad you noticed, darling. Well, I haven't learnt how to do the handles yet. Okay, well... It's very rough, but it is my first effort. You know, for a month's work, it's... - A month? - ...quite an achieve... - Well, now, probably... - No. How long have you been doing this course? Well, I've been doing the course for a month, but I mean, the pot didn't take a month. But I'm loving it, I have to say. I'm loving going to college and... And this is the first of many things. I'm going to be filling this house with artefacts. What was he like on that Friday? I want to hear it again. Well, as I told you, he seemed particularly happy. He, um... You know, made me a cup of tea and, um, we had a... A rather lovely breakfast together. And, uh... And off he went. And what did you think about him when you first met him? - When, when he came here? - Mmm. Well I... I was disposed to like him because you did. Did you just like him because I did? No. No, I... I grew very fond of him. And what did you feel when he died? I was, um, very concerned for you. No, not what I felt. What did... What did you feel? When you got that phone call? I felt through you. You're a very good little dog. Done really well. Come on. Come on. Have you got everything? Um... Yeah, - and my bag's upstairs. - Bag? I'll get it. Thank you. It's on the landing. Can't you stay for another night? - I can't stay. - Just one more... Not this time. Not this time, but next time, okay? - Right. Soon? - So soon, I promise. For a long time. For a rest. - I wanna ask you something. - Yeah. I am so sorry, I... I need some more money. For this film. For this graduation film. - Really? - Yes. And I promise, I'll pay you back. It's for the film? - It's for the film. - Uh-huh. It's £10,000. Oh, darling, that is a lot of money. Let me take that. - It's heavy. - I know. Bye-bye, darling. - Bye-bye. - Be well. - You, too. - Bye, Mummy. - There you go. Bye, my darling. Hope the preparations for the film go well. - Drive safely. - Thank you, Daddy. See you soon.

Always. ♪ It's not the way you lead me ♪ By the hand into the bedroom ♪ It's not the way you throw your clothes ♪ Upon the bathroom floor ♪ Been thinking about you ♪ I just couldn't wait to see ♪ Fling my arms around you ♪ As we fall in ecstasy ♪ Ooh, sometimes ♪ We have, like, ten... Before that, you don't even have a main cast. I know. This is... This is so much more important. I'm so sorry. This is so much more important. At least need to have them both. I have some ideas that... I mean, some of them are very different. Um... He's too handsome. - He's too classically... - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Right. - It's too... No, I don't... I don't really like him. I don't really like these two guys. No, I was gonna say, these are too... - Yeah. - He's nice. This is not... They're... They're too... They're too glamorous. Are you getting it as well? It's also the picture, but I agree with you. I know. They're wearing lots of makeup. They're too sophisticated or something. - Yep. - I agree, I agree. So this... This one I really like. I don't know, what do you think? She's like... There's something fragile, but still, like, you know, a bit noble about her that I really like. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get this girl cast, get this guy cast. Um, but, I mean, Julie said she's on it. So... She seems okay. She seems okay. I mean, I'm a bit stressed about it, but trust her. So, we'll see, yeah? Okay? Good. Yeah, James, you all right? Maybe this one, but I really don't like him. No. No. It's... No. - Happy you don't like him. - No. Uh, he's called Pete. I saw him, um, maybe two weeks ago on stage. - Mmm. - He's very special. I think, if I understand well, the project, I think he's the one. He has something that I cannot even describe. You really have to meet him. So if that's okay... - Mmm. Yeah. - We can meet him tomorrow? - Mmm, yeah. I would love that. - Perfect. I would love that. And the girl? And I'll call her agent as well and try and talk to her tomorrow. Yeah. Perfect! Fantastic. - Great! Brilliant. Thank you. - All right, thank you. Does the budget stretch to me getting an editor, or... The budget does not stretch. The budget stays exactly the way it is at the moment. Away from the windows and just set them a bit back. Because at least you could have some light through it, or something. What do you think? I think let's do that. Um, Garance, if you just have a second? Yeah, sure. Um... It's just a thought I had just... Just now. Um, you don't have to have an answer immediately. But I just... It suddenly occurred to me if you were interested in... In playing the girl? Julie, do you want a hand? - No, we're good. We're fine. - Sure? Yeah, we're so close. Mind your toes. Why's he got your bed? For the set. - Oh, for your film? - Yeah, that's what I said. Oh! Right. So is it going to your school? - Yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - When is that? Like, next week we start. - Next week? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Oh. Okay. I didn't realize it was that soon. Next week. So everything's set with it? Yeah, more or less. Like, casting's set? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah... I was... I wanted to talk to you about it actually, 'cause I... 'Cause you know I've been going for castings - and it's not been going well. - Yeah. Well, not like, badly, but not... I'm not getting parts for things. So you're... You're saying you've cast it? Yeah, I have two people that are... They're really, you know... They're quite right for it. But I... It's got nothing to do with you. That's the thing... It's got nothing to do... So you've not... So I'm not in it at all? Not this one. - And it was such a... - Okay. I just, I honestly... It... It's got literally... It's got nothing to do with... You're such a fantastic actress. It's nothing to do - with your abilities, or... - Mm-hmm. It's just... You know, the girl who I have in mind, she... She's not an actress. You know, she's a filmmaker and... - She's not an actress? - No. But she's a filmmaker and that... I kind of wanted that, so she can bring a little bit of her own experience to it. Mm-hmm. - Okay. Well... - But it's got... It's got nothing to do with you. And I didn't... Well, it does. If you're not casting me in something, then it's me. You don't... I'm not... I'm not gonna take it personally, but don't say it's got nothing to do with you, 'cause obviously, casting's completely - to do with the person. - Okay. Okay, well... Where's the wall? The wall was, it is no more. A girl fought against me. Little swallow. Hello. - Hi, Pete. - Hey, guys. Looking good, mate, looking good. - Hello. - Hi. - You look great! - Thank you. - Looks great. - I feel comfortable. - Yeah? - Mmm. Can we introduce you to the DP, Ben? - Of course. - Ben, this is Pete. - Hey, man. - Pleasure to meet you, mate. - How's it going? - Lovely to meet you. - There. - There? - A little bit up, please. - Up? Perfect, no, stop, stop, stop, stop. But don't worry about being too steady, but also, you know, not too documentary. So... But don't worry about... Okay. The onboard music is so awkward to me for... If we hear... If we hear a little... - Oh, those are the shoes? - Yeah. Okay, cool. Oh, love the color, though. Like the color. Trying to figure out. We can do something to that. It's a weird rhythm anyway. So we can do whatever we want, right? So we're gonna, are we gonna... I feel like my energy was too high, or too lively. I don't know how to say that. Do you know what I mean? I... I thought it was quite lively. I was really happy. So it's... It is quite accurate. It's really good. But you're much more... No, you're perfect. You're perfect. You have nothing to worry about. Are we all set up now? Are we ready for a shot? Yes, we're ready. Ready when you are. Because I... I'm just looking at this and I actually think it's the wrong angle for what we're... For what I want. That I... I actually, um... I... I think we should have it on the other side of the door, because it feels wrong to me that we should have this camera seeing more than she does. Because I don't want to see exactly what's going on inside this bathroom because she doesn't. And I know that's just... I know that's a last minute thing. - I know it's really, really... - Julie, we're all set up. I know. I know. I know we are! We're all set up for this scene. I think we should... You want the camera here? - You want the camera here? - Here. Yep. With the door shut. Do we see in the bathroom? Um... Maybe here. Here, because she has to come... - She has to come past. - Okay. Um, we don't wanna see inside the bathroom. Maybe when you... Actually, no, sorry, sorry. Here. - He's very good at hiding it. - For a year. But also you... Yeah, for a year. For a year, but also you have suspicion. You also don't really want to believe this. This is an easier thing, you know... It's not an easy thing to believe about someone you love. - You know? - No, I don't. - Do you understand that? - I don't. - Well, it's, you know... - Well, it's... You're saying you don't want to believe it, I guess, but... - Yeah. I can understand that. - But this is the furthest... This is just one of the times we are seeing... You have a feeling as though when you were dancing together and during that whole time, during that whole day, during dinner, doing whatever you were doing before you started dancing, before we saw you, that is going on in the back of his head, he is wondering when is the next time he's going to go off by himself and do whatever he does, that you don't really properly know what goes on. Because I give him space and I respect him. So I... There's this sense of... You do, but also, he doesn't... He doesn't really allow anything else. - Fine. - So that's... You are doing as much as you can. You can say that in this relationship, he has... He has the power. Yeah. 100%. There may be some knocking. Yeah, well, find that... I'll find that out. Yeah, there may be some knocking. Um... That looks good by the way, Ben. Yeah? That looks nice in the monitor. Yeah? Okay. Well, I mean, there's a lot... There's a lot of wall. Well, I don't know if I, what I can put up there, man. Let's see if I have something in the bedroom. Where should this scene go? Because if we start with that like, "Oh, my God, yeah, he's actually doing heroin." Then we have to maybe sit in... In the bathroom and start talking and maybe... No. You wouldn't talk about it. Honestly, I don't think you'd talk about it straight away. - You don't want any dialogue? - Can we get cast... No. Honestly, it's not about that. Julie, can we get cast in there - to start taking positions? - Yeah. - Yeah. - It's honestly... It's just... You cannot just see that and not talk about it. Well, that's how I did it. That's how it happened. So don't say it. You didn't say anything. - Okay. - Can we just see positions? Alfie, please! Please. Please open the... I just want to see you. And cut. Cut there! Cut there. You're... You're... You're angry. You're... You're irritated by him. He was like a child rushing off. You know, you're in an adult relationship and he's running off and being... Did you ever see sadness in there? Yeah, quite a bit. "Quite a bit." So that was... Maybe that's why he, you know... Maybe that's why he... Um... Sounds like he's calling for help. So I'm just gonna... It was a terrible lunch. - It was okay. - Yeah? Heavy. - Heavy? - Mm-hmm. Excuse me, um... Do you know what we're doing? Stop asking me that. What? I feel like you know more. Not really, honestly. The more we... Hi. So the more... The more... ...we work on this, the more I realize I don't know anything. Honestly. I don't understand the, the... The relationship. Yeah, the origin of the relationship. You know what I mean? Yeah, you go to school with her. You know her well. No, not really. She was... She was not... She was not here very often. - What, at school? - Yeah. I like her because she is, uh, very sensitive and I think she... She has a voice, but she's... I don't know, too naive, too fragile or... And she's not... I think she's lazy, too. She's not working enough. She should, you know... She should be at school. She should... She should be more understanding that she has to learn a lot from others. And again, this is, um... This is in... In the real life. This is three days before your character died. Okay. So this is possibly your last moment, um, of intimacy... Well, not int... Well, yes, intimacy, but before it could be intimate. So you're... You're feeling... You're feeling resentment a little bit, because you don't know whether he scored or not. He's possibly coming down from something. And then, I mean, I look back and I kind of, um... He's all over the place. Have awareness that possibly he was always either on something, coming down from something. Just about to score. So he just... So that's also the reason why I'm objecting here. Absolutely. You're not in that mood. You're not in that space. And you're both almost not very present. How did he feel about her paying for everything? What was that dynamic like? Because was there not... Was there not an element of shame there? I'm not trying... I don't want you to think I'm trying to - justify his actions. - No. I'm just trying to justify his problems, really. And at the moment, I don't feel like I know what they are, but, um... So now he's stolen everything and sold it. I just feel like that's a... A desperate moment for him. I don't know where to go with this, you know. If someone has, you know... A friend of mine stole money from his mum last year, and everyone around him thought he was the worst human being in the world at the time, but I knew that he wasn't well. I knew that he wasn't in a place of normal head space, I knew that. Is this quite difficult for you? Am I making it more painful for you? No. No, no, no. You're... No, it's not you. That's the thing, it's really not. This is good. I think it's difficult because I'm coming up against your idea of him rather than a reality of him, which is understandable. But... It makes it quite difficult for me to come from a place of truth. - If that makes sense? - How are we doing? So, uh, we need Pedro in here, ready to dress the set. So what's the plan? We're just getting a very simple shot of the two of them. And there's no standing up, or walking around or anything. What's... What's happening? So they're just having a conversation... - Is it evening, Julie? - Okay. Um, yes, yeah, sorry. It is quite late at night. - Okay, night. - Uh, night. So you... It's possibly like, 10:00, 11:00. - Okay. - Um, maybe 10:00. I've been here all day. You have to close the... You've been here all day. You were here while Garance was at film school. Right. Um... Yeah, so you've been here all day. Okay. So... So they're just having a conversation and it's just... It's quite static. - You're high. - I'm probably high. So I think maybe just like... Maybe here? - Yeah? - Yeah? I mean... I'm sure it wasn't night originally. I mean, we're not lit for... I mean, this isn't night. Yeah. What, late night? Yeah, like, 11:00, 10:00. - Yeah, please. - I know, I know. I'm sorry. - I honestly thought I said it. - Do we... Seriously, was that... Uh... Yeah, we'll just... We'll go with that. If that's what it's supposed to be, then we'll work with that. So we need to start. Okay. It's just starting like... But this is the problem... This is the problem. It's the same, like, you know, with how many days we're into... I've lost all track of time. Nothing... Nothing changes. It's the same every single day. We... Like, none of us have any idea what's going on. It's like, it's fucking ridiculous. And I'm getting grief from Marland about, like... I feel confident about what's going on. - That was one day. - No, no, no, no. Marland, I'm getting grief from you - about how much stock... - All right, fine. ...we're going through. Like, it's... We've got more now, so it should be fine. Um, can we just... Yeah, but we cannot continue like this. - Like, we can't. - I think, I think... Like, it's just like, you know, we're, you know... All right, we're students, but we're like... Okay, there were a lot of conversations that happened during prep that... Yeah, I know. I know we're students, I know we're still learning and all the rest of it. But this is our grad film. - It's really, important stuff. - Yeah. And, like, we should be, like, professional now like... Okay. So should we start making a move to make the changes that we need to make? Necessary changes. Well, like, what's... What's the point? Because we don't know what's going on. Am I antagonizing, or am I defending? No, you... No. And I'm not... But... Am I antagonizing? 'Cause I don't think I am. Look, we're dealing with a serious ego back there and I don't know what his problem is. But he's making it impossible. He's been impossible all day. Let's just drop it. Let's just drop it. It's all just broken down. Like... We just don't know what's going on. It's that... It's that more than anything. Okay, can you be specific about what it is that you need from us? Specifically. Because you're talking about you needing everything to be clear. Specifically, well, having a shot list would be nice. Like, having like, following the script would be nice. You know, having some kind of sense every single day. Like, instead of having, like, the lights changing, like, halfway through because suddenly it's day and then it was night and then it's day and then it's night and then it's day and then it's night again. - All right, Ben. - Like, it's just, like... So okay. So thank you for that. So we're gonna work on that, okay? Yeah, but we've had this conversation so many times! So what do you wanna do? Do you wanna walk away? - I want somebody to... - What d'you wanna do? I'm that close. I'm that close to walking away. - All right. Do it. Do it then. - Okay. Don't say that, Marland. Guys, calm down now. No, but he's not gonna do it, he's all mouth. You have to also learn how to take critiques and have to find a way to make things work for everyone. You're like a captain on a boat. That's what you are. We've worked together before and, like, that's why we wanna work with Julie, because of the way that she works. But this time it just feels like we don't know what's going on. It's, like, you know, and we've talked about this and it just feels, like, we need to say this now, because we're all getting tired... Okay, I think that we have said it. I think that we have. I am... No, but you're not listening to me. I don't know how to explain it in like a... Do you want me to be soft and gentle and all the rest of it? Like, I'm saying it like this because nobody's listening! I am so tired and we are. We're all tired. We have to find another way. We have to find a system, something. - This is too much. - Yeah, yeah, we are. We're gonna sort this out. Yeah. You're absolutely right. Things have been too much. Yeah. Do you understand that, Julie, yeah? Where's my sunny girl? Hmm? Could you put that up for me, darling? I don't want them to get the wrong idea. No, you've had enough. - Shit! - Oh. - I'm so sorry! - Oh. I'm so sorry. Oh, shit. What's happened? - Is that the Etruscan pot? - Oh, what a shame. - Vandalized. - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Mummy. I really, really, really didn't... I shouldn't worry, it's only a term's fees. Darling, you didn't do it on purpose. I'm sorry. And I really wouldn't. I'm sorry. No, it's just one of those things. I'm sorry. Yes, can you get them out, darling? - There's some sharp bits. - I think we can. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Quite sharp bits. - I'm so sorry. Ooh, yes. Can you get the dogs out, darling? I don't want them - to hurt their feet. - Come on. Here. No, it's all right, it's all right. Come on. Oh, dear. Just one of those things, isn't it? Have you cut yourself? No, just a little bit. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, is your finger all right? Mmm. I'm gonna go and get a... Worse things happen at sea. ...a, um, dustpan and brush. And put the kettle on and start again. I shouldn't worry. She can make another one. No, you stay out of here, please? Did you... No, no, no, no. Absolutely. Good. Anybody else want some more cake? Mmm, no, thank you. I came across the ravaged remnants of that in the kitchen. Well, we're making fast work of that cake. I know. It seems to be going down quite... Quite good, actually, it's from the shop. - Did you make it? - No, I... It's fine. It's Mrs. Daley's best, is it? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. ♪ I was sold up the river ♪ To the red slave trade ♪ The stores were gathered The plans were laid ♪ Synchronized watches at 18:05... ♪ As Horatio's pounding heart slowly stilled, and the welcome adrenaline drained from his veins, he became aware of sentences forming. Flashes and fragments of the vision of his situation, that could only be that of a future self, whose fate was very different to this inauspicious beginning. I tried this this morning and, um... Yes, I see that. It's much better. I liked you as a robot cowboy in Westworld. Less so as a cutter of films. But you liked it. - I liked it. - What did you think? What were your thoughts? It excites me. I like... I like what I'm seeing. Right. I wish it was my film. You know... Right. That's marvelously generic. I mean, if... I think we could do with a few more details of the faces. Maybe to see some of the faces as a bit of... I've asked for two more days. Lydia, can we have two more days - to shoot some close-ups? - No. Then we can't cut them in, Chris. Okay. Yeah. We can't cut in those close-ups we don't have. No. What do you think? What does it make you feel? Okay. Yeah. You're forcing me to have a tantrum. It excites me. It excites me... You said that last time. That's a great thing to say. Yeah. Once is enough, though. That's all it needs to be, in a way. We should put cutouts. This is what we should do. Little cutouts of the audience in front of the monitor. It's what Scorsese does. Okay. To remind him that it's cinema... - Cinema. Yeah. - ...and not something - you watch midweek... - Okay. ...with your uncle. - I think it's great. - Mmm. - It looks great. - Oh, fuck off! It's got energy. It really has. Say what you think. Don't say something that you could say after watching anything. - "It's great, it excites me." - Yeah. Say something specific, so that we can decide what the next scene - should make you feel. - Okay. So that we can take an emotional line through something. I think it starts really well, but it's a little flat in the middle, emotionally. Am I... What does it make you feel? Oh, fuck all of you. Honestly. Fucking hell! Sorry about that. I loved it. I really liked it, so... I think it's great. He's got it all out of perspective. - He's stressed. - Oh... Yeah. And... Drunk maybe. Let's take another look. I'll just do this. I don't know if I got enough of Garance by herself. I... I wish I'd had some solo... - In this? Mmm. - Yeah. I would. 'Cause it's just, I think it's too much of the two of them. I wish I'd had a moment just her. Well, you've got this moment. Well, it's not... - Yeah. - Yeah. I think it's a nice shot. I think it will... - We can figure it out. - Mmm. Please? You can really tell that they had chemistry. Uh, Pete and Garance. - Mm-hmm. - They really did. Kind of... You can really see it in her eyes, though. I think it's quite fitting. They work well together? They... Yeah, very, very well, I think. Um, yeah, they really liked each other. It was kind of, I think it's quite... It was, I think it was quite good for the characters. - Mm-hmm. - Although very different eye between the two of them, you know. Well, we can move things around - and we can find it and... - Yeah. I think it's probably perfectly normal to come to editing in the first place and watch the rushes for the first time and feel ambivalent and it must be so strange having an idea of something and then... And then seeing it for the first time. Those kind of questions are completely normal, but I think, as we continue to watch it and piece it together and, uh, kind of play with the moments of it, - we'll find it. - Mmm. Okay. Good. Thank you. I needed to hear that. No, it'll be fine. It'll be great. It's funny. Good. Yeah. - Do you wanna watch some more? - Yeah. Let's do that. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Cheers. - Cheers. Thank you. Were you... Were you particularly close to his parents? I mean, have you spoken to them a lot since or got to know them well when you were with him? I got to know them quite well. Um... And I don't know whether I'm... Whether I really am too busy, or whether I'm making excuses. 'Cause I've... Because I feel as though when I see them and talk to them, I feel like I'm... "Intruding" isn't the right word, but I mean... You know, they lost their son, their only son. And I... I grieved in such a different way to them. And I feel... I don't feel as though I have a place there as much now. It's funny, but I... I feel really bad I haven't been in touch with them as much. Obviously, I've never been through what you've been through, but I think... I'm sure from the parents' point of view, they're obviously dealing, you know, with this unimaginable loss and, uh... And tragic event, but that doesn't, kind of, mean that you're not, too. And I'm sure they're only sympathetic to that fact. And you know, you've... I don't think you should, uh, take it upon yourself in a kind of destructive, negative way. Um, from my point of view, from what you've said, um, you shouldn't do that to yourself. Thank you. And also, with you, you know, making the film at school, which I don't know whether they know about, but I'm sure your family obviously knows about. It's, you know... It's a brave thing to do and... I mean, you know, I think, I don't think you can... What you've gone through at any stage, at any point of your life, if this was to happen, would be unimaginable. So for it to happen at such a young age and particularly, I don't think you can... You just can't do that to yourself. It's not... It's not fair to yourself. Do you want another drink? Uh, no, I'm fine, thank you. Um, do you want to come back to mine for a drink? If you have time. Uh... This evening? Mm-hmm. Um... I... Actually, I said I would see my boyfriend this evening. Um, so I probably can't tonight. Okay. Yeah. No, I understand. I'm so sorry, I misunderstood. No, no, no. No, no, no, it's fine. No, I said I'd, uh... I said I would cook something. He hasn't been very well, um... Uh, for a little while now, so... - I'm sorry. - That's all right. Um... Uh... Yeah, so I said I'd cook him dinner. So I should probably do that. Yeah. That's really sweet of you. Ah, well, he hasn't had it yet. So, you should probably... Yeah, I might run. Is that all right? - No, not at all. - You sure? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, completely. - Okay. - I'll see you soon. - Yeah, okay. - Thanks so much. Yeah, of course. Thank you so much. Thank you so... Yeah. Thanks. Good luck. - Thank you. - Have a nice night.

I'm struggling to recognize whether I'm, um, missing Anthony as a whole. That, as the person he was, a very - strong individual, he was. - Mm-hmm. And still is in my mind - quite present. - Mm-hmm. Or whether I'm missing having a companion and that intimacy. And that mysterious leader who... Who, you know, made decisions for me and took me places and... And... And... - Helped you be a risk taker. - Mmm. But a controlled risk taker. Controlled by him. Keep talking. I've... I miss having that intimacy with someone. And... And I don't know whether I'm quite ready to have that with someone else yet. Because I... I really want it. I really want to be able to be next to someone in bed. And talk to someone who... Who I don't go to film school with. - Mm-hmm. - And who's not my parents or Anthony's parents. But you do realize, you are the one who can make it happen. Do you think I have to change a bit? Well, you won't change character, but you do have to change a few habits. Not only of thinking, but of being. You did it with film school. And in film school, you found acquaintances.

But I wanted to make my film, so it was an easy decision. Oh, I'm sorry about that. I always wanted to be like Orson Welles. Lydia and I are back together. Good! Good, I'm pleased. I ground her down.
