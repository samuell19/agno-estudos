[CHILDREN LAUGHING] I know. I know, I know, but I can't come today because, um, Sam's here and, and my dad, and Dad's working, so... I know, I know it's the last day of summer, Melissa, but I'll see you at school tomorrow. We can do something at recess, okay? Okay. Bye, Melissa. Bye. [DOG BARKING] Sam! Sam. Sam. Sam. You said you wanted to play. I was waiting. Dad said I could watch TV. Good. And now you're done. And put Gabriel back in his cage. TIM: Doc! Did you take my phone? You're in trouble. No, I'm not. Come on, lunchtime. You are such a thief. You want a sandwich? You're making lunch? Sure. [DOORBELL RINGS] Hello. Hello. Is your mother home? Who are you? I've come... I'd like to interview for the nanny position. The nanny. Okay, um... [STAMMERS] Um, well, I tried to call but the number was busy and the address was on here. I think you'd better talk to my dad. Come in. You sound like Mary Poppins. I'm English. I knew that. SAM: Who's she? That's Sam.Hi, Sam. I start school tomorrow. I'm four. How wonderful. I'm Gillian. And I'm Doc. That's short for Rebecca. I'm 10. Hi, Doc. Hi. She's a nanny. You know, like Mary Poppins. Where's your umbrella? [LAUGHS] It's in my case. Come on. Dad's this way. Hey, Dad, she's a nanny! Uh, hello. Hello. I'm Gillian Malkin. I was hoping to interview for the nanny. She knows Mary Poppins. Really? I'm sorry, I, I did try to call. And you know Barney. Come on, feeding time. Good luck. [CHUCKLES] Don't you just hate precocious American kids? Oh, not yet. This is my first interview. I keep forgetting to break her will. I beg your pardon?My kid... Break her spirit. Like breaking a horse? It's a joke. Oh, I'm sorry, the notice said you wanted a sense of humor. It's okay, my wife's got the sense of humor. I keep trying. She's not home. Oh, should I come another time? DOC: Dad, you want me to show her the house? Where would I be without her? [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] Oh, what a wonderful room. Mmm. [SIGHS] This is so wonderful. [CHUCKLES] I keep saying that. It's okay. Originality is only 5% of the grade. [CHUCKLES] Do you have a, a cook, or a housekeeper? Annie. And, uh, this is the, uh, uh, nanny's room. This is so lovely. When did your nanny leave? She didn't. We never had one. TIM: The most difficult part of the job will be taking care of our daughter. Oh, no, Rebecca's delightful. Not Doc. Our other daughter. Oh, she must be out with your wife. Should I wait...She's not out. Asleep?She's not home. Our other daughter is Maggie. She's five years old and she exists only in the mind of my wife. Miss Malkin, if you think you might want this job I want you to know how seriously I take the subject of Maggie. She's the most important part of your job. Maggie. DOC: Let's go see if she's still here. SAM: Okay. You've been talking about my sister. SAM: Maggie's out with Mom. Maggie starts kindergarten tomorrow. I start pre-school. That's nice. Doc, don't you and Sam have something to do? Come on, Sam. I want to see how hard I can hit you with the ball. Doc's going to teach me and Maggie how to play catch. I hope you take the job 'cause I could use some help. I'm afraid that I... I don't understand. I'd be amazed if you did. Maggie is five years old. Sam is four. Sam thinks he has an invisible sister. Annie thinks she has a 5-year-old daughter. Doc and I pretend to see her. [CAR HORN HONKS] [CAR APPROACHING] That's Annie. [BOTH SPEAK INDISTINCTLY] DOC: There you go. Be careful. [DOC AND SAM LAUGHING] [SOFTLY] Hi. Hi, Mom! Look, look! ANNIE: Aw... [GIGGLES] Hey. Hey, Mom.Hi, guys, how are you? Beautiful day, huh?Yeah. Oh, I got lipstick on you. Sorry.[GIGGLES] That's okay. Sweetheart. This is Gillian. I know. Doc and Sam were raving about you outside. Well, Doc's right. You're wonderful. Oh... You're perfect. [CHUCKLES] Perfect? Oh, yes. I just put up the notice today and you're the first to come. Oh, I see. And you're so far from home. You're very brave, isn't she, Tim? She certainly is. Well, you won't be lonely with us. Look, I don't have any references. I've never been a nanny before. But I raised all my younger brothers and sisters. The youngest just turned 15. Um, my mum's been kind of sick, you see, for a long time. You're perfect. And I'm glad that you don't have any references because we've never had a nanny and you've never been one, so we'll learn together. [CHUCKLES] Isn't that right, honey? Sure. Uh, Annie... It's $400 a week. Plus room and board and use of a car and two days off, of course. Oh, that's... But maybe you want to discuss this. Annie, why don't we, uh, give Gillian a call in a day or two, let her know. And she probably wants to think about it too. Don't you, Gillian? Oh, but, honey, she just arrived. She has no place to stay. Do you? Your car in the driveway, it's full of suitcases. Oh. She knows Mary Poppins!Oh. [LAUGHS] Maggie. This is Gillian. Gillian, this is Maggie. Hello, Maggie. It's nice to meet you. Did you leave the front door open again? I'll do it.Oh. Kids, don't run. Oh! Well, did Tim show you your room? Oh, it's wonderful. Good. Then it's settled. Um, okay, well, Doc you help me unload the car. And, uh, Gillian, you'll want to unpack. And just let us know if you need anything, okay? Okay. Is this all right? Welcome to the family. [SIGHS] Are you unpacked?Mmm-hmm. DOC: Do you like it here? Oh, it's like a dream. Do you live in the country in England? No, London. Big city, huh? Hey, you forgot to push. Come on, you don't hear Maggie complaining. SAM: Yes, I do. Especially about vegetables. DOC: Okay, come on, Maggie, no hitting. [GRUNTS] Stop it, Sam. SAM: She punched first. Sometimes you gotta separate these two. You mind pushing Maggie a while? Um, no. Thanks. Come on, Sam. What are you doing? Pushing Maggie. Maggie's in her room taking a nap. Your father told me. That I know Maggie's not real? Mmm-hmm.Right. I do. She takes a lot of naps. And how does one know? You don't always know. Um, Gillian, why don't you sit here next to Maggie? Sam, Maggie, dinner. Sam, did you two wash up? I did. Maggie didn't. I know you did. He's just teasing. Mmm... [SLURPS] Mashed potatoes are my favorite. Maggie, would you say grace? ANNIE: Amen.ALL: Amen. Doc's stealing Maggie's food. I was cutting her broccoli. Oh, okay. Sam, eat your own food. Don't worry about Maggie and Doc. So, you come from a large family? Um, five kids. I'm the eldest. Thanks. And you raised the others? My mum couldn't, you see. And my dad passed away years ago. What's, "passed away?" Died. Her daddy is with the angels. How old were you when your mom got sick? I was about 10. And you stayed until the youngest could take care of themselves? That's very unselfish. You postponed yourself. Honey, she may not want to talk about this now. GILLIAN: No, it, it's fine. Um, I wouldn't say I was unselfish or anything that grand. Of course not, but you are. And now it's your turn. I'm sure your mother agrees. What's her name? Emma. Emma. Have you called her to let her know that you're here? No. Oh, well, let's call her right now. Honey, it's about 3:00 am there. Oh, that's right. [CHUCKLES] Well, please call her first thing in the morning and let her know that she can call you collect whenever she misses you. That's very nice, but... You haven't been away from home, have you? Um... I went to Loch Ness once. [CHUCKLES]Ooh. [DOC LAUGHS][SHUSHING] Hold still. It's an eyelash. ANNIE: Okay? I got it. See? Now it's good luck. You got to make a wish and blow it away. Oh, no, come in. This is a busy time. I've got to put Sam to bed. You give Maggie her bath. She'll tell you where everything is. Maggie, you can take a tubby in Mommy's bath. [CHUCKLES] Well, she's learning. We've got to help her out. All right, um, she likes the water a little hotter than warm. [GRUNTS] It's been an interesting day. Oh, I don't know. You think? Why did Mom do this?I don't know. Me either. You have that look.What look? Your crinkly look. I have that? I don't know why Mom did this. I don't know if Gillian can handle it. It's a lot to ask of somebody. Why do we need her? Mom does everything for Maggie anyway. We have to trust there's a good reason. Like we trust there's a good reason for Maggie? Exactly. Like we do that. People grow and change, Doc. Even parents. Nothing stays the same forever. Sweet dreams. I love you.I love you, too. All right, you can stay in a couple more minutes. GILLIAN: That's right. Tomorrow's a big day. First days are a little scary but it'll be fun, I think. Once you get there you'll meet lots of new children and, and there will be lots of new toys and things to play with. Oh, um, did I get soap in your eye? Oh, good. I, I thought I did. I went out to the museum site today. Without me? You rat. So, what did you think? Well, all those skinny columns, um... It looks kind of like a giant bicycle rack. I'm kidding, it's breathtaking. Really. A bicycle rack? [CHUCKLES] So, what do you think? It's intentional, I like bicycle racks. Of Gillian. She'll be great. I'm sorry I surprised you. I was going to interview a few before I said anything 'cause, maybe I wouldn't find the right person or maybe I would change my mind. I had no idea you wanted help. It just seemed time, I guess. I mean, you've been so patient. I thought we could use somebody. Then maybe you wouldn't have to work at home so much and you could go back to your office, if it's still there. Wow. Have I been complaining, 'cause I'm fine, really. You never complain. Is everything okay?Sure. And Gillian will be fine, once she settles in. [GROANS] Oh, well. Okay, Maggie, your turn. You'll wear this. And these. And these shoes. ANNIE: I usually give Maggie peanut butter and jelly. Sam gets milk, Maggie gets juice. And Doc? She makes her own because she has to get ready first so she can catch the bus. TIM: Okay. Okay, Sam, Maggie, let's go. No, Tim. We have a nanny now. Gillian will drive them. Well, I always drove Maggie. I know you did. But now we have Gillian. How do we know she can drive? Because I drove with her this morning. She did fine. You drove this morning?Yeah, early. How's she going to find the school? Don't forget to eat Maggie's lunch. That's what Dad did.Thanks. Okay, Doc, I'm going to drop you at the bus. Have fun, you two. Hey. You are so beautiful. I bet. Okay. Bye.Bye. [EXHALES] Ready? All right, the school... First day, Maggie. Let's go. ANNIE: They should be getting out any minute. GILLIAN: I could have done this. I know, but it's Sam's first day of school and I've never had a nanny before. I guess I have to ease into this. Of course. [SIGHS] You know, if you want to go and talk to your friends... No, that's okay.[SCHOOL BELL RINGING] Tim always drove Maggie to school. I don't really know anybody. WOMAN: Bye, children, see you tomorrow. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hi, hi, hi. How was your day at school? SAM: She's nice. I made you something in school today. You made this? They have a machine. ANNIE: Oh. Do you like it? I love it. I really love it. Do you want one?Oh, I'd love one, Sam. But it can't say "Mom." GILLIAN: [CHUCKLES] All right. How did you make it?Hi. They have this machine that can make any kind of button. ANNIE: Hi, honey, how was your day? Did you have a good day? Did you make new friends? Yeah. That's nice, Sam. [KIDS LAUGHING] ANNIE: Okay, let's go down the slide. Be careful. [LAUGHS] You go first. Hold on. [LAUGHS] Good job. Are you okay? Good. Mom. Maggie said I couldn't play in the sandbox with her. You tell your sister I said if she doesn't stop saying that that she can't play in the sandbox. Okay. She has to go to the bathroom. I'll take her. I'll go with you. [SAM MUMBLES] Sam, we're going to show Gillian where the bathroom is. We'll be back in one minute. It's okay, I'll watch him. Thank you.Oh, that's all right. You from London, eh? Yes, are you from London? Within the sound of Bow Bells. I'm Peg.I'm Gillian. It's nice to meet you. SAM: Come on, Matt, let's go. Yeah. ANNIE: Do you want a family? I think so. It's so odd to me. There are so many people in the world who live alone. It's just foreign to me. I've never been alone. The most alone I've ever been was on the flight here. I could never have done that. Why did you? Partly for the money. Shh.And... Partly because if I'd stayed at home I knew what my life would be, more or less. Before I'd even lived it. We'll be right here, honey. Uh, if you're not going to use that... My daughter's in there. [CHUCKLES] Are you crazy? You got another kid? You think a dragon could blow it down? Wouldn't the soldiers stop him? They can't see him. The dragon's invisible? Mmm-hmm, like Maggie. Oh. Can you hear the dragon? Of course, when it's roaring. I just can't see him. SAM: My mom can see Maggie. I do sometimes. But I always can hear her, and I always can feel her. Especially when she punches me. Maggie's different. ANNIE: Hey, pretty. I can't believe you guys actually used to wear this stuff. Watch it. I never saw you look like this. You and Dad should go out some time dancing or something. What, and leave you guys alone? Are you nuts? My beautiful Rebecca. [DOC GIGGLES] Hey, are you still up? Bedtime, Doctor. Oh, come on. Let me have one more chapter. Uh-uh-uh.Please, please, please. Bedtime. Okay. Good night.Good night. Good night.Good night. [GIGGLES] It still looks like a bicycle rack. Really? [CHUCKLES] Does Sam seem like he's coming down with something? Mmm-hmm. He caught it from Maggie. Right. You were going to say... [SIGHS] Nothing. I'm just thinking. About Gillian? It's been three weeks. And every time she takes Sam and Maggie to school, she just opens the door and lets them out. As opposed to... Walking them in. How do you know? 'Cause I've been following her. Oh. [SIGHS] Other than that? She's great. WOMAN: That's good. Now, over there, we have the little tart, Caroline. She's a Georgia peach. Pit, that is. Spends most of her time in the pool with her guv's stepson. And there's Ramona, over there. No, I told you not to let go! PEG: She's Romanian, nanny for life. Rules the roost. Temper on her like you won't believe. They love her. They bought her a house. Her own house? She'll have a party now and again. I'll take you. Gillian, we've been chums now, what, couple of weeks? Uh-huh.Mind a silly question? Fire away. What's with the swing? Oh. Invisible friend. Nice to have a little playmate, isn't it, Sammy? Mmm-hmm. You and your friend want to come over to the sandbox and play with Matthew? Yeah. SAM: Come on, Maggie. He's not going to hurt you. Can Maggie play with your truck? You can just dump it in the sand. She'll get it. I told you, Maggie. He's nice. WOMAN: All right, gather everything up. I want you to put it in your backpack. Tell you one thing, Gill, American men have got it over the Brits on two counts. Great teeth and great bums. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Have you found yourself one yet? Oh, um, I don't have much free time. Oh, don't let these Yanks work you to death. Peg?Yes, love? How would you describe a nanny's responsibility? Oh, easy. Try to keep the little buggers from drowning. Try to keep yourself from drowning them. What if there was some kind of, situation? Situation? A scandal? You're not pregnant, are you? Stop. It's for a friend.Oh, depends. Americans are very fond of shrinks. You know, head doctors. [CHUCKLES] I've read that. They hang their dirty laundry anywhere. Thrive on telling each other the most intimate details. So what, do you go to one of them for advice or something? Well, if that's the kind of trouble you think you're in. But I don't need the money, Mum. Because they provide everything, really. I don't need money and you do. All right, next month I'll keep some. Is Sally checking in on you every day? I'm not worried, I just love you. [ANNIE LAUGHS] I'm going to get Maggie now. No, no, you don't. Ah, she's... Um, yes, I'm happy. Really. [ANNIE LAUGHS] She got away again. Okay, I'm going to get you next time. Yes, I, I miss you too. ANNIE: See? You toss it into the deepest part of the pond. [CHUCKLES] It is fun to be sick a little and miss school. A day for us. But you're really fine now, so tomorrow, school. Okay? [SIGHS] ANNIE: I'm thirsty, are you? [GASPS] Look. Hey, Gilly.Hey. How was school? Fine. So, this is real English cooking? I love this.[GIGGLES] It's good of your mum to let me do this. It'll blow her socks off. [IMITATING ACCENT] Can I help? Does that make it less English? [GIGGLES] Don't be such a twit. Um, you can stir that pot. Okay. Doc, I was thinking... You get two weeks' vacation at Christmas. Mmm-hmm. Your parents gave me a ticket home, to be with my family. I'll have to hurry on your present then. When you going? Um, in four weeks. And... I was wondering if you'd like to come with me and have an English Christmas. Why would I want to leave here? I thought perhaps you could use the rest. Get away. From what? Well, the stress. What stress? Of Maggie, you know. Why would I need to get away from Maggie? Maggie's not real. TIM: Here come seconds. Mmm. Great meal, Gilly. Mmm. This is really delicious, Gillian. Oh, I'm so pleased you like it. Sam's doing fine. Doc, some more Yorkshire pudding? I'm pretty full. Oh, perhaps Maggie would like some. Wonderful. Mmm. This pudding doesn't taste like dessert. [GIGGLES] It's a different kind of pudding, honey. It's fantastic, this is a great meal. I could have never made this. [GIGGLES] Oh, it's easy. In fact, it's easier when there are more people. That's it. A dinner party. You, you could invite your friends and I'll cook. An English feast. Yeah, a party! It's a wonderful idea, Gillian. It's really nice of you to offer and I'm sure it would be fun. It's just... I'm pretty tired when I finish work and this house is sort of... A retreat. Sorry to be an ogre. ANNIE: Yeah, you can have one in your room. Okay. Pretty. [GASPS] Is she okay? Oh, yeah. She just pricked her finger on a thorn. Honey, be careful. ANNIE: Okay, let's see. Isn't that pretty? Perhaps we should start again. GILLIAN: I'm sorry. I guess I don't know how to do this. But you do know how to talk. That's all we do here. You say you didn't come here for yourself, but for the family who employs you. Yes.How did you find me? The telephone book. Do you know anything about psychiatry? Not much. Normally, when someone comes to see a psychiatrist and they claim they're coming for someone else usually they're lying. I don't lie. And they say that. Look, these people need help. All right, let's say I believe you. Your concern's misplaced. What do you mean? I shouldn't worry? It's the 4-year-old boy you should worry about. The older child knows the sister isn't real? Mmm-hmm. Well, I would say, probably, this fantasy is bonding her closer to her father and her mother. It, uh, allows her to help them. And her sense of reality is probably, more or less, unimpaired. This might even enrich her in some way. Oh. However, the 4-year-old. His sense of reality is impaired. He has no way of distinguishing between what is real and what isn't. Oh, God. [SIGHS] What should I do? In a case like this, someone may need to intervene. The family clearly won't. I can't. We have governmental services that can provide assistance. You could talk to someone there. That's really all I can say. [SIGHS] I'll only charge you half the hour. I could use a little time to myself. ANNIE: Oh, that's wonderful, Sam. Guess what kind of whale it is. Um, baby beluga? No.Monstro? Is it Moby Dick? The rainbow whale who forgot his rainbow? Maggie, Mommy already said that. Hi, Mrs. Wood, I'm Tim Beeman. Hi.TIM: My wife, Annie. Hi.Hello. Our daughter, Doc, and this is our nanny, Gillian Malkin. Hello.Hi, nice to meet you. And this is my sister, Maggie. We noticed you were demonstrating some puppets over there. Uh, could we take a look? Oh, of course. Sam made a wonderful one. Sam, you want to show Mom and Dad your puppet? Rebecca, how are you, dear? I remember you. Fine, thank you. My nickname's Maggie. We will, Maggie, just a minute. Sam, we're going to go next door for a minute. Do you want to stay here and we'll come back and get you? Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. WOMAN: Natalie, show me your picture. Tim, I don't see any of Maggie's drawings. Well, maybe they got lost. Mom, look. Maggie's drawing. Oh, Maggie. It's beautiful. Of course, let's put it up. Hi, Jenelle. Did you show your mom your artwork? Yeah, it's beautiful. Shouldn't we... Doc!ANNIE: Mr. Felix. I'm Annie Beeman.Oh, hello. Hi. I just wanted to tell you how much I admire your work with the children.FELIX: Oh, thank you. I see how you encourage their imaginations and stimulate their curiosity. That's very kind of you. You're... Would you excuse me for a minute? [GAGGING] I'm going to throw up. Oh, honey. Let's go. Um, Gillian, can you go get Sam? Sure.Let's go. [GAGS] I'm sorry, Mrs... Is Doc okay? Fast asleep. Annie...Hush. [HUMMING LULLABY] Annie... Quiet. I'm singing to your heart. GILLIAN: I have no idea why she does it. WOMAN: Really? You've been there three months. You must have some idea what caused her to create this psychosis. I don't know, I mean, it doesn't make any sense because in every other way, she's so normal. Could he abuse her or them and you're just not aware of it? Of course not. They are wonderful people. Mr. Beeman is a saint and so is she. She lives in a fantasy and he enables her to do it and makes their 10-year-old help. That's wonderful? You make them sound awful. You came to me because you were worried about the children. And child abuse is what I investigate. Because it's a crime. You are completely twisting my words. I'm sorry I came. I'm just repeating the story that you told me, that's all. May I have those notes please? No. Are you sure you're just not afraid of losing your job? You do have a green card. [SNIFFS] Mmm. Smell those, Maggie. Mmm. Are those good? And look, raspberries, your favorite. I'll take these. ANNIE: Sam? Sam? Sam! Hey. I missed you. Mom. What, baby? Are there other people like Maggie that I can't see? I don't know. I can't hear them. Let's go home, baby. I asked Maggie. She said she doesn't know. Let's all go home. Okay? Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I was off somewhere. No, you're not very sick. It's just a little fever. [INHALES] I guess Mommy's frightened. You know, mommies and daddies get frightened too sometimes. No. Not of the bogeyman. Let's say our prayers. Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. Sweet dreams, honey. I know. I'll come back to check on you. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] TIM: Come on in. There's room for a circus in here. I don't want to disturb you. No, it's okay. [SIGHS] I guess Maggie has a fever. I guess she does. I've never seen you out here at night. Does that mean you're out here every night? Is that all right? Sure. What's it for? It's my secret luxury. To sit in warm, bubbly water under the stars and look at the silhouette of the mountains and listen to the birds. Pretty far from England. I must sound really silly. Never be embarrassed of being delighted, Gillian. That's something Annie taught me. She seems sad tonight. I've never seen her like that. She's worried. She put the baby monitor in Maggie's room. Could I... Ask me how it started? I'm sorry. I wondered when you would. No, I should let you enjoy this in peace. You're very good at all this. I'm sort of amazed. Sometimes I just want to cry for Annie. Then I think of what you must feel. And Doc. You want to know why she does it? How it started? That's fair. You're kind of family by now. Are you hungry at all? Sure. It was, uh, five years ago. One morning I was sitting here, having coffee like I do every morning. Annie comes into the kitchen and she goes to the stove and... She had her back to me. But when she turned, I could see she was sterilizing baby bottles. And, and she was holding something in her arms something I couldn't see. She said, Maggie had kept her up all night with colic. It seemed we had a new baby whose name was Maggie. I thought it was a joke. Then Doc came in and Annie asked her if Maggie had kept her awake with her crying. My heart stopped. I didn't know what to do. Did you take her to see someone? Psychiatrist? Sure. We went to one of the best in town. We get to the door of his office and Annie looks at me with tears in her eyes and says, "Please don't make me go in there. "He'll take away my baby." Well, I had a pretty good idea what he'd say so I went in alone and listened. I got as many professional opinions as I could. I learned that she would almost certainly be institutionalized. I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it. Did you say you were hungry? Starving.Good. Me, too. I knew this had to be something so deep and desperate and I thought what terrible damage it might do to her to just rip it away. She wouldn't do this without some extraordinary need. Did you talk to her about it? If it was something she could have talked about I don't think it would have happened. You know, for a long time, we, we lived just for each other. My career was just taking off and if I had a gig in Paris, we'd go. Or a weekend seminar in Stockholm, we'd just go. We loved our life. I'd come home in the middle of the day... Then Doc came along, and life began to revolve around her. Annie loved being a mother. Ooh... She was in heaven. I was spending more and more time at work. I was hot all of a sudden and... You know, when that happens, you just want to go with it. So, I was gone a lot of the time. I think Annie blamed herself for the change. She figured she'd messed up somehow that her, her attention to Doc was somehow driving us apart. So, she did the only thing she could do. Do it again, only, do it right this time. [SIGHS] Maggie. [SIGHS] Maggie. The funny thing is, Maggie did make everything right again. I came back. I was totally focused on my family. I thought having another child would make Maggie go away but getting pregnant... Sam... I think just reinforced her conviction that Maggie had made everything right. What about Doc and Sam? I just don't know. I think Doc's stronger for it. We're partners. We talk about it. If there are scars... And I look for them, I don't see them. Sam? Sam's okay, for now. For now. But, what if... I mean... What if... I'm wrong? [EXHALES] Well... I do ask myself that. When do you think it will end? When Annie says it does. Come on, Sam. Whoa! Hold on, hold on! [ROLLER COASTER WHOOSHING] DOC: Doesn't that look fun, Sam? [LAUGHING] MAN: Six to a car. Watch your step. Watch your step. Step right on up. [KIDS SHOUTING]MAN: All right. Oh, I'm sorry, Miss. You're gonna have to wait down there 'cause it's six to a row. Oh.Maggie, you and Gillian go together, okay, honey? Come on, Maggie. [FERRIS WHEEL CREAKING] Six to a car, watch your step. Thank you. No, uh... [PEOPLE EXCLAIMING] [PEOPLE WHOOPING] [LAUGHING] Whoo! DOC: It's beautiful up here. Look at this. The beautiful ocean. So pretty. [LAUGHING] I love it. Whoo! Watch your step. BOY 1: Pizza!BOY 2: All right. Where's Maggie? She, she's right here, Annie. She was on my lap. You just didn't see her. Maggie's lost. She didn't ride with Gillian. It's okay, Mom, we'll find her. She couldn't have gone far. Annie, I, I thought she was in my lap. They wouldn't let her ride in your lap. Oh, Mom, it's okay... Don't worry, I know where she is. MAN: Is there a problem? Yeah, my sister wandered away but we think we know where she is. What does she look like? She's five years old and she has brown curly hair, blue eyes and she's wearing a jean skirt and white sneakers and her shirt is... [SOBBING] I can't remember what color her shirt is. DOC: Um, it's the purple one with the balloon. Are you sure? Yeah, 'cause we had a fight about it. She took it out of my drawer without asking. MAN: What's her name?Maggie Beeman. MAN: Okay, I'll put it over the PA system for you. Mom, you and Sam stay here. Gillian and I will go find her. Come on. Okay. [SNIFFLING] DOC: This is a first. I can't believe it. Kids get lost. I guess it's her turn. We found her. What? Let's go back. 100 on the nose. You got a fever, baby. Maybe it's just from the excitement of the day. Well, we'll see. Gillian brought you some tea if you get thirsty. With honey.Mmm-hmm. Oh... All right, but I want you to sleep. Which one do you want? Oh... Gillian, can you get me the Grandfather Twilight book over there? Thanks. Okay. I'll be back in a couple minutes to hear your prayers. Good night, Maggie. She'll be all right? I think so. It's just that she's getting these so often. It's not like her. Anyway, uh, let's not bother Tim with this. He would just worry unnecessarily. I'm so sorry... About today. Oh... It had a happy ending. Let it go. I was just... [SCOFFS] Incredibly stupid. Oh, let it go, Gilly. I have. So has Maggie. Okay. TIM: Do you like this one?SAM: Yeah. TIM: Okay. We need two more. Two more, coming up.TIM: Okay. [DOORBELL RINGS] I'll get it. That's going to go on top, right? Yeah.TIM: Okay. WOMAN: Is this the Beeman residence? Um, Gilly? Are your parents' home? Dad! [WHISPERS] Why? [RAPID FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Oh, Annie. Has, has there been an accident? No, everything's fine... I mean there's been no accident. I'm Marie Tan Lee, from the Department of Children and Family Services. Are you Mr. Beeman? Yes, I am. Could we speak privately? Gilly, take the children in the other room. Now. Mr. Beeman, we've had a report of possible irregularities. Irregularities? What the hell does that mean? Mr. Beeman, I need to speak to your children. May we come in?My children? Yes. A report? From whom? I'm not at liberty to say. May we come in? I will make this as fast and painless as I can. No. These police officers are here to make sure that I do. And that I'm able to have access to your children, privately. Listen, Miss... Whoever the hell you are, you may not have access to my children and you are not coming into my house. Mr. Beeman, I am coming in. That's the law. The law? Yes. Whenever we have a report of possible child abuse we go to the home involved to verify the charge or to dismiss it. If I have to, I can come in here and take your children. That's the law, sir. Or you can let me in and let me do my job. Well... Why do you have to see them alone? Think about it. Because of some anonymous report you claim to have received? I have received. Well, who the hell from? And what abuse? I can't tell you. The department's policy protects the identity of the informants. If you let me in to see your children I can determine whether or not this need go any further. If I find no evidence of abuse this could end right now. I'm calling my lawyer. I don't believe this. Call him. You have three minutes before we come in. Please leave the door open while you make the call. Go ahead. [LAUGHING] It's a very nice room. Thanks.[LAUGHING] I know whose room that is. That's my room. Knock, knock. Who's there? Sack.Sack who? Sack of potatoes from Sacramento. [LAUGHING] Whose room is this? DOC: It's, um, uh... SAM: This is Maggie's room. So. You'll be hearing from us. Goodbye, guys. What does that mean? Thank you, Mr. Beeman. [HORNS HONKING] Tim, is everything okay? TIM: [OVER PHONE] Yeah, it's fine. Where are you? Stuck in traffic. Are you sure everything's okay? TIM: Annie, what is this? We're fine. [SIGHS] I had the strangest feeling. TIM: Look, just come home. We're fine. Okay. Love you. TIM: Me, too.[DISCONNECTS CALL] Well, I guess they're fine. Oh, honey, you're burning up. [WEEPING QUIETLY] [KNOCK AT DOOR] Gillian. GILLIAN: I'm so... I'm the person who talked to them. It's all my fault. I believe you. What did you do? I... When did you do it? Two months ago. It was before you explained everything to me that night. I, I never thought they'd come here. Oh, God, it was just so awful. Yes, it was. What did you do? I went to one of those psychiatrist people. You saw a psychiatrist, and... He said that Doc was fine because she knew that Maggie was a fiction. But to worry about Sam. And, you didn't want to tell me. No, because...Because I was part of it. So, then you went to the Child Services Office. Again, instead of me. I thought that they might be able... But she was so horrible, and I left. I was, I was angry and frightened and I walked away and I never, never thought she would do anything. You saw that woman who was here? What did you tell her? You told her that Annie thinks she has an invisible daughter. That I forced Doc into playing along with it and that Sam has spent his entire life around this insanity. I know now that that was wrong. I love you all. I was wrong. Were you? Yes! It's just what you think if you don't understand. That's comforting. But those people in Child Services are not going to understand. I know. And I'm, I'm so sorry. I'm leaving.You're not leaving. Why? Because you're going to help me fix this. DOC: Dad? What can they do? Nothing. I don't know. If she can walk in with two cops, that was gross. It was gross. How'd they know about Maggie? It doesn't matter. It was Gillian. I hate her. TIM: No, you don't. She loves you. Doc... Everybody makes mistakes. And you love her. Not anymore. She's going to help make this right. But what can they do, take us away? No! Let's run away. Well, there's an idea. How about an island in the South Pacific? Come on, let's do it. We'll leave tonight. Mom and you and me and Sam. Not Gillian. Honey, they can't do anything to us, I promise. But what if they do? What if they try to take us away? Then we run away. Well, what if they come with tanks and more cops and all that? We sneak out the back right down to the boat in the open sea. You promise? I promise. ANNIE: Tim? Tim, call the doctor. Maggie's really sick. Annie, slow down. If she needs a doctor I'll take her to him, like I always do. No, um, she's too sick to move. My God, he'll make a house call. He's been her doctor her whole life. I don't know. We'll see, okay?Please. DOC: Are you all right?Hmm-mmm. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. He wasn't available. I'll just take her to the hospital. I'm going.Honey, you don't have to. I know. Gillian, can you help me get Maggie dressed? We're taking her to the hospital. [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] Okay, honey. WOMAN: [OVER INTERCOM] Dr. Grace to room 305. Dr. Grace to room 305, please. [PHONE RINGING] TIM: Honey, you're going to sit here and I'll go talk to the nurse. Oh, don't worry, honey. Daddy will be right back. Everything's going to be fine. May I help you? Yes, I, I have this pain in my stomach and I'm worried it might be an ulcer. Well, we can take a look. Do you have insurance? Yes. Have you read this yet? Here's one I've never heard of before... Seismosaurus. There's T-Rex. Mr. Beeman? Oh, wouldn't you rather Mommy wait here and when you come back, you'll be all better? Good. It'll be okay, honey. No. Tim, I want to come. Well, two to one, outvoted. I understand you have stomach pain. I... Do, yes. Where? Uh... Here. Could you remove your shirt, please? Well, I had this fever just 24 hours ago and, and I didn't call my doctor. Now the fever's gone, but this pain in my stomach I just thought it might be related. DOCTOR: Really? Hmm... Well, that's pretty interesting, Mr. Beeman but honestly, you seem fine. I mean, I believe you... Uh-huh. If your stomach hurts your stomach hurts. Right. Then again, it could all be in your mind. Really? Well... Hope you feel better. Thanks. I'm really glad I came. Uh, Doctor, excuse me.Yes? Um, could I have, uh, one of those lollipops? Uh... Yeah. Sure, I guess so. I have a daughter out front. Of course. Thanks. TIM: Nice doctor. It's nothing worry about. Oh, Maggie, you look better. Was there a prescription? The usual. Aspirin, fluids. Everything's going to be okay. Come on. Tim?[GASPS] I'm sorry. You startled me, that's all. Are you okay? I remember the day I first saw you. Oh, God. I'd do anything for you. Tim. You're shaking. Anything, Annie. Are you worried about Maggie? No. No, it's just... [EXHALES] I don't know how to express it. I want... I want to take care of you. I want to tell you how much I love you. I love our family. DOC: Hey, Gilly. Can I come in? Sure. What's the matter? Oh, it's... Our going to see that woman at Children's Services today. I guess I'm just frightened. Does your mother know, do you think? No. She doesn't. I'd know. God, this is just so awful. Come on, there's nothing to worry about. You're going to be great. You're so sure. Mostly. I hope you're right. Well, like Dad said if anything does happen we just run away. Run away? He said that? Yeah. He said we'd run away to the South Pacific. [SOBBING] I don't want to run away. Sweetheart. [SOBBING]Shh... [SOBBING] I don't want to... Shh... Oh, Doc. Everything's going to be fine, I promise. LEE: Mr. Beeman, you may come in now. This is Mr. Beeman. Mr. Beeman, this is Mrs. Carperhorn and Mr. Schmidlen. I have a lawsuit in here. You invade my home with armed policemen threaten me with insubstantial evidence, talk to my children alone. About what, I don't know. Then send a letter threatening to take my children away if I don't appear today for this meeting. This isn't even a courtroom and I could lose my family? I hope you've prepared well because I don't intend to stay here long. I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Beeman but, where's your wife? Her presence was requested. My wife is at home, sick. Your wife is the crux of this thing, Mr. Beeman. The allegation is that she believes she has a nonexistent child and that you support her in this fantasy. That's ludicrous. Where is your wife?I just told you. What about your son? We want to talk to him. I brought my daughter. It kills me that she has to go through this again and I'm allowing it, but that's it. You've got our nanny. You can see her alone, too. She's with us all day, every day. Ask her whatever you like. And you can talk to my daughter. Which I hate! But you are not talking to my son. He's in school. My wife is sick. Are we clear on this? Because if we aren't and you come back into my life after today, believe me... You don't know what trouble is. Anything else? We all understand your attitude. We'll talk to your nanny now. LEE: Now, Gillian, we know between ourselves, that you're the one that started these allegations. No, I didn't. Excuse me? Well, I, I mean I did come to see you, that's true, because there was a nanny, a friend of mine from the playground and she had a problem... She's Irish, actually... And she was a little frightened. So I, I said I would come here and try and find out some information for her. So, I did explain to you or at least I, I started to a situation that she was dealing with in her home but it was obvious you couldn't help. So I left. And where this nonsense comes from, I don't know. That's not true and you know it. What's not true? You told me a story of a seriously disturbed woman. A mother of two small children who believes that she has a third invisible child. Do you honestly deny that? That's the oddest thing I've ever heard and, yes, I deny it. How are you, Rebecca? Fine, thank you. Why am I here? Some children need protecting. That's why we're here. So, don't be afraid to say anything you want. We're on your side. Uh-huh. Now, this thing that we talked about before, um, your invisible sister... Invisible sister? You have an invisible sister. My brother has an imaginary friend or two. We call one Maggie. Is that what you mean? Actually, Maggie was my invisible friend before she was his. It was kind of like the tooth fairy. You grow out of it. Or, do you still believe in the Tooth Fairy? No. DOC: Me, neither. So anyway, I grew out of Maggie. It was fun. But Sam, he liked her. So, now Sam's got Maggie for a while. You see, Sam believes in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, and Maggie. You think I should tell him about Santa Claus and everything. Is that why I'm here? No. We're trying to determine if you and your brother are in a safe environment. We're fine. Isn't it true that your mother thinks she has an invisible daughter and that you and your father help her with this fantasy? [LAUGHS] No. Do you know... See, this is weird. See... I don't even like knowing there's no Santa Claus. So, every year, I help my mom and dad fool Sam into thinking there is a Santa Claus. [SIGHS] So, we all play along with Maggie like we play along with Santa Claus. There is a big difference between Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and a particular fantasy that nobody else has, like a sister who doesn't exist. Really? She's not a sister. But that's a good idea! She could be. Santa Claus is an established cultural fantasy. Now, when somebody has a fantasy that nobody else does, Rebecca, that's a very different thing. Oh. Like Martin Luther King. We studied him. He had a dream. No one else had it. No, not like him. Like craziness... Santa Claus is sort of crazy if you think about it. I mean, come on. One guy for the whole world, in one night? And the thing is, I got to tell you even though I know there's no Santa Claus, I still kind of believe in him. I don't even tell my parents this. You won't tell them, will you? So, when we're putting out the milk and cookies and stuff that I know Dad's going to eat and the carrot for the reindeer, that I know Mom's going to eat I still believe he's out there somewhere. I believe in Peter Pan, too. So, what are we going to do? Maggie's fun. Is that bad? Could you, um, ask your father to come back in? Sure. Mr. Beeman, your daughter is quite impressive. It appears that there's been some mistake. I hope you understand that our motives are to protect the children. That's why we're here. I do. And I'm sorry about my temper. I'm glad you people are here for the people who need you. I'm glad we don't. [ALL CHEERING] [LAUGHING] [SIGHS] Doc, there's something I have to tell you. It was me. I'm the one who caused all of this. I'm, I'm sorry. I knew that. Everyone makes mistakes.

ALL: Happy un-birthday![DOC LAUGHING] Aren't you supposed to be in school? Well, Doc and I were playing hooky and we ran into Gilly doing her errands and, uh, we all decided to take the day off. And we got you something. Look! Oh! It's a horse. A really old horse. Oh, it's a beautiful horse. Thank you. TIM: What's wrong? Maggie's sicker, a lot sicker. I'm doing what the doctor said. The fever is back. TIM: Do you want to go back to the hospital? I don't know. Not now. Um, could we put this in her room? I mean, would you all mind telling her that it's for her? DOC: No, no.TIM: Of course not. [SCRIBBLING] What is it? Maggie. I'm really worried. Maggie lives in Annie, remember? Yeah. I just feel so helpless. We are. Annie has all the controls. And, when you love someone you are... Totally vulnerable. Children teach you that. [WHISPERING] What? A, a what? Where? Can you point? I can't see it. Must be a beautiful angel. [SNIFFLES] And it must be just for you. Mom, I made you something in school today. Oh. [SNIFFLES] Look at that. What is it?It's a turtle made out of clay. [SOFTLY] Aw... I'm going to paint it tomorrow. But I could give it to you unpainted. Painting it would be nice. You look sad. Is Maggie okay? Oh, she's a little sick. Hi, Maggie. I made something for you, too. Actually, Mom, could I give yours to Maggie? Of course. Here, Maggie. [SNIFFLES] Hey, Sam. Maggie saw an angel up there in the corner. Do you see it? Yeah, I see it. Yeah, I think I see it. Yeah, I see it! Is Maggie contagious? No, honey, she's not. Is Maggie going to feel better soon? I don't know. 'Cause I told my teacher I would like to bring Maggie for show-and-tell. Show-and-tell Maggie. She could just walk down the hall. And she said, "Yes." Well... She has to get better first. Okay... Let's leave Maggie alone with her angel, okay? [LAUGHING] You know what? Can't be trusted. Cannot be trusted.[DOC EXCLAIMS] SAM: Hey, Dad! [DOC LAUGHS] ANNIE: Smells great. Maggie's coming to show-and-tell with me. Ooh.When she gets better, honey. No, really, you guys, she's going to be fine. The fever's going to break and she'll be fine. Okay? Well, it looks like you have everything under control. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [BABY MONITOR STATIC CRACKLING] Hey, Mags. How you doing? Great horse, huh? You know why we got it? Well, I know you know. I did pretty well, huh? Move over. You know all those times I thought you were a pain? Wearing your clothes, so Mom would think you did. Eating your food... Fighting with you... Doing your artwork... Well, I was thinking, if you had an ordinary handicap, like you were blind or deaf, I'd be doing a lot of stuff for you, right? So, you're invisible. I just want you to know, you're not a pain. [SIGHS] Oh, Maggie. You're getting sick a lot. Something's changing, I don't know. TIM: [OVER BABY MONITOR] We have a wonderful family. It's not like any other family, and we may not make sense to other people, but... It's our family and it works, and... You're a part of it. I wish I could see you. I wish I could hold you the way Annie does. But I can hold her, and I can see her. And maybe through her... You feel it. [SIGHS] Yeah. I'm a silly daddy. [BABY MONITOR STATIC CRACKLING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] TIM: Mmm. Okay, kids. Let's get a move on. Time for school. All right, you guys, hop, hop. [SOBBING] DOC: Mom? Dad? [SNIFFLES] Let me do this. Kids... [INHALING DEEPLY] Your sister died last night... In her sleep. It was very peaceful. Remember that angel that you saw waiting in her room? Well, it must have been waiting for her. And now Maggie's with God and with all the angels. Is Maggie a angel? Mmm-hmm. [ANNIE SNIFFLING] Doc... You know, too, that Maggie's with the angels. Yeah, Mom. I know. Are you okay? I'm sad. For us and for me... But not for Maggie. SAM: Mom?What, honey? Is Maggie with God? Mmm-hmm. One day Dad will be with God. One day you'll be with God. And Gilly... And Doc, and me, too. And then we'll all come back, right? I think so. If God wants us to. SAM: Mom, next time I don't want Maggie to be invisible, okay? ANNIE: Okay. [SNIFFLING] Maggie... I know your light is shining brightly wherever you are now. But I know you're still with us... In our hearts, always. Maggie, Sam asked me to say this prayer. ALL: Now I lay me down to sleep I pray the lord my soul to keep if I should die before I wake I pray the lord my soul to take. Thank you. [SOBBING]
