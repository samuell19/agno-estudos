(wind whistling) (dramatic music) (engine starting) (tires squealing) (horn honking) (horn blaring) - [Man] You're looking for me, aren't ya? - It's a woman! (horns blaring) Come over here to me. (upbeat music) (tires squealing) What the hell you doing, Rip? You shittin' me? - Get out. (horn blaring) Hey, you want a lift to town? - I'm not going to town. - Where ya headin'? - That way, straight ahead. - Well, there's only a little town up ahead. - Well, I'm going beyond that. - Hey, are you in some kind of trouble or something? Well, I tell ya, nobody's seen a dress that nice out here in a long time. Come on, let me give ya a ride. Just to town. - I need to go a lot further than that. - You're not gonna get in? (groaning) (door creaking) (yelling) (dog barking) (wind whistling) (bike approaching) - My Mom! - What's wrong? - There's blood. (yelling) (groaning) - Hello. - I'm having my baby. - Where's your phone? - We don't have one. - You don't have one? Go get a doctor. - There's no doctor in Silver. (panting) Baby, where is Mrs. Martin? You were supposed to get Mrs. Martin. - All right, move. Move, move, move! (screaming) Oh God. - Help me. Help me, please. - I can see the head. (grunting) - Please help me. (screams) - All right. Push. You're doin' good. One more push! Push. (screaming) One! One more push! (screaming) One more push! One. (groaning) Oh God. - What's wrong? I want my baby. - It's okay, it's okay. - What's wrong with my baby? My baby! What's happening? - Stop it, sweetheart, the cord! Come on, baby! Breathe baby! (baby crying) - You're an angel. - [Chrysty] Here you go. - Stay with my boy. Please, just until my husband gets here. He'll be safe with you. Please. - Okay. Just until your husband comes home. - Thank you. - Okay. - That baby wasn't due for another month. Good thing you happened by. - Yeah, happened by. Where are you from? - You got blood all over your pretty dress. - Anyone called her husband? - [Linny] I left a message up at the site, he wasn't there yet. - I'll take care of Nate. - She asked me to watch after him. I said I'd watch over him for her. - June would have to be delirious to ask a total stranger to take care of her kid. - Well, June and me aren't strangers anymore. - They aren't strangers anymore, McGill. - I'm hungry. - Yeah, yeah. Go inside. I'll make you something to eat. - [McGill] She had no right to bring her into our community. - She didn't bring her in. - Oh yeah. I heard that, Linny. She's just following the yellow brick road. (timer ticking) (dramatic music) - Stop staring at me. (chiming) - That's why we don't have trees and grass here. The wind blew them all away. - So they had only known each other two weeks. And he left his job as a welder, and she quit her job in the front office, and they rented a U-Haul and they went out west. - U-Haul? - They're big orange trailers. And they put everything in it. It was the biggest moment of her life. Leaving her little town with the man she barely knew. - I don't like this story. - Yeah, well, they lived happily ever after. Is this normal for your dad? What time does he get off work? When does he get home? - I don't know. Where were you born? - Oh for God's sakes, Kimmy. Go to bed. - Who's Kimmy? - No one. I'm gonna get some air.

Well, where the hell have you been? - Hey Nate, why don't you go in the other room, okay? - [Chrysty] Why didn't you come home yesterday? - Do you believe in soul mates? - You shouldn't be saying such things. It's pounding. - Like a drum. - Well. I... I told June that I'd here until you got home. So, I should get going. - [Rip] Goin'? Where, you gonna walk to the next town? - Yeah, if I have to. - Well, this is it. I tried to tell you that yesterday. There ain't nothin' for 300 miles and then there's only Amboy, which ain't nothin'. - Well, is there a bus? - No. There's no buses. I mean, if there was a bus that'd mean that we was some place, but we're nowhere. There's no airport, this is the end of the mail route. I mean, the only way back is the direction you came. - Drive me to Amboy. - Well, it's 10 hours round trip at least, and I gotta get June home from the hospital. Somebody's gotta stay here with Nate and feed him. - Take him with you, I'm not a sitter. - Oh, I know you're not, but I just know that June would like to thank you in person. She told me that you saved the baby's life. So why don't you stay here and I'll be back as fast as I can, okay? You stay with Nate. (dramatic music) - I seen Rip's truck. He's my brother. Are you coming to the tent tonight? - I really don't drink. - Neither do I. Alcohol I mean. It beats sitting at home. Sometimes the walls seem to get closer and closer together until I can't breathe. Rip's great. He mostly raised me after our father was killed at the dam. He was only 13. It isn't his baby. The newborn. He isn't the father. - Does he know? - He can't have kids no more. He contracted the mumps and they dropped. His testicles swelled up like softballs. He couldn't walk or sit. - Who's the father? - That's one of the great mysteries. I envy you. - Don't. - This town. Sucks the life from you. (dog barking) (dramatic music) (glass smashing) (panting) (dramatic music) (wind whistling) - Excuse me! Where's your produce section? - You're in it. - I'm in it? (register dinging) (laughs) Right, right. (dog barking) - Hi. Sorry. So can you? Drive a stick? - Yeah. - You can? Oh, I'm Ruth. Hi. (laughs) I'm looking for a milk man. How long are you gonna be around? - I'll be gone as soon as June comes home. - Oh, you have to leave. - I wanna leave. - This town's not so bad once you get used to it. There's a rhythm here, all these women. We all have our periods at the exact same time. Now that's something you don't wanna miss, right? - There aren't any men around. - No, they're all building a dam. They're gonna make this huge lake and they're gonna turn the whole desert into fertile farmland and golf courses. They just come home on the weekends. - They're gone all week? - All week, every week. Some of 'em are third generation. You know, just like their fathers and their grandfathers' fathers. - It's a crazy idea to turn a desert into a lake. - Yep, it is. You know, Silver's not a bad place for a woman to hide out. If she needed to hide out. - I'm not hiding out. - Well, if you decide to stay, I could use the help. It was nice to meet you. - Excuse me. Excuse me! That's my car. - There's a thousand dollar fine for ditching a car on the road in this state. What happened? - It got real hot then it stopped. - There was water in the tail pipe. - Is that bad? - Blown head gasket. - That's bad. - [Katie] Could be. - Expensive? - Well... Block might be cracked. It could just need a gasket. Will have to take a look at it. Take a couple days. - It doesn't have to be too fixed. - Honey, if it's crossed the desert, it better be damn fixed. - Thanks. - Hi. Hey. Rip, this here is my guardian angel. - Yeah. We met early. - It's a beautiful baby. - Well, maybe you oughta get in and lay down, huh? - Yeah, I think I will. Okay. (wind chimes chiming) (sighs) (gentle music) - This town does not need another girl. - Right, you mean Miss Pretty or June's new one? - Both. - [Woman] Thank you. - I'd like to know who the father is. - Yeah, how you figure that, McGill? Somebody keeping a secret on you. You're so far into everybody's business, they're just all waitin' for you to tell 'em when to pee. - I'll tell you one thing. Somebody done it to her. You don't get pregnant just playin' with yourself. - Thank God for that. - Thank God for that indeed and praise the Lord. (laughing) - [Linny] What's so funny? - Oh, God just blew through the tent. Can you feel him? - Where ya been? - I seen June and the baby. - You just leave 'em alone? - Chrysty's with her. - I would never leave her alone with my baby. - June's lucky. If I done what June die, Derek... - Yeah, we know what Derek would do. You know, I got family up in Denver you and the kids could stay with. And a whole week before Derek would ever know. - What the hell kind of advice is that? - Good advice. Yeah. (laughing) - Turn around. Come here. (laughs) The hat. (laughs) What made you change your mind? - Well, I can't leave without my car, and I figure who couldn't use a little extra money. - Well, you're a vision. (laughs) Now, are you ready? Most of the the accounts are just let-in-fridgers. - Let-in-fridgers? - Yes, let yourself in and put the milk right in the fridge. If you're hungry just take a snack. - Do I need keys? - No, this is Silver. Nobody locks anything. They're nothing worth anything. All right, you set? - Yeah. - [Ruth] All right, good luck. - Okay. - What's the matter? - I haven't had job since high school. That was 14 years ago. - You haven't had a job in 14 years? What are you, a princess? All right. Good luck. - Well, now we know she hails from bumfuck Idaho. Lookie here. - [Ruth] That's private property, McGill. - She's traveling with a kid. - A kid? Where's the kid? - Exactly, where is the kid? Check the trunk. - The trunk? Oh God, McGill, there's tiny air holes in the trunk. - I knew it. She's a kid killer. Jesus! - What? - Jesus, Katie, we gotta get my brother down here right away. (screaming) (laughing) - Happy Halloween, McGill. - What about the air holes? - Shitty body work. I gotta get back to work. - Hello. Hey sweetie. I'm your new milkman. Woman. Hello. (clanging) Linny? - What are you doing here? - I'm the new milkman. Woman. - Where's my baby? Melanie! Mel! Melanie! Don't tell anybody you found me like this. I don't drink. I felt a cold coming on. I couldn't sleep. Why aren't you in school? (dog barking) - She'll get better. - The other day seemed so magical. Like a dream. I forget the pain. So you've never had a baby? - No. (baby cooing) (bed creaking) (dramatic music) - The photographer forgot to tell us to smile. - June said you were a beauty queen. - A lifetime ago. Miss valley of fire, it's a date festival. A lot of people thought I could have been Miss Nevada. It was exciting up on stage. - Ever wonder what would have happened... - If the rubber hadn't broke? My mother told me not to tell Derek about the baby. Not to keep it. - Well, my mother was dead. - How old were you. - I was almost 10. She was only 26 when she killed herself. Strange, huh? I'm older than my mother ever was. What is it? - Nothin'. Sometimes I wish I'd listened to my mother. - Oh yes. Oh. Oh, I love you, baby. (dog barking) - Hey buddy. Want some milk? - He don't like milk. Gives him the screamers. Where's Kimberly? Was it an accident? I was praying for you last night, because I know that he brought you here for a reason. Just like I know that I found this little shirt here for a reason. And I think maybe that he brought the two of us together for a reason. What? I just want to know what happened. - Nothing happened. - Why won't you tell me what happened? I'm not gonna hurt ya, I just wanna know... - Nothing happened! - I just want to know what happened to your baby, that's all. (dramatic music) (door creaking) (whimpering) - I need a place to stay. - It's not the Hilton, but it's home. There's actually a shower out back. It's pretty private, there's just the lizards. I'm sure they'll love it. Welcome home. (dramatic music) - [June] You don't get stretch marks like that singin' in a church choir. - McGill says she was run off from one of those Rene screw farms. - Yeah, well, McGill says more than her prayers. - I seen a TV show about women who have babies and sell them for thousands of dollars. - If she had thousands of dollars, why would she need to work for Ruth? (baby crying) - She wouldn't say what happened to Kimmy. - Maybe God swooped down and took her. It happens, you know. - Linny. - What are you saying Linny? - Nothing. Just that people who live in brick houses shouldn't throw glasses. - God, you are stupid, Linny. Dumb as sand. - Stop it. - I'm tired of McGill presuming the worst of people. - She's right, McGill. She's good people. - She's divorced or separated. Maybe she has a kid too, so what? It ain't against the law. - I think that we are losing sight of the fact that there's a little girl involved here. And can anyone of you tell me where she is? Hmm? What has she done to that little girl, Linny? (kettle whistling) - Hi. - You wanna go for a drink? - I gotta get up early in the morning. - No, you don't, you know why? No deliveries tomorrow. - I shouldn't. - [Ruth] When was the last time you just went out and had a drink with a friend? - I don't know. - See? Come on, you have the rest of your life to sleep. Let's go. - Give me a minute. - Don't ask me, I have no idea. - [All] Hey. - To the rest of our lives. - Been a long day, hasn't it? - It's been a record. - We're alike, me and you. - No, we're not. - The others just don't understand the road. - You don't know what you're talking about. - [Ruby] Don't let the bed-bugs bite. (sign creaking) (glasses clanking) - [Woman] Hey. - Ruby's been saving this for a special occasion. - Like now. - Is that a joint, Ruby? - Yeah, is the possession of marijuana still a felony in this state? - [McGill] That's my understanding. - What, are you gonna arrest us? - May I have a hit? - This is entrapment, you asked me! Well, I'll be damned. Closet toker! Blast off. (laughing) - All right, you girls have had your music all week, and now it's my turn. - Ooh, watch out. Chrysty's on fire. (laughing) (rock music) - The perfect band. (laughing) - Is there a volume control on this thing? - Yeah, it's on the side.

But I had to see you again. - Do you wanna get out of here? - Who is she? Where did she come from? - I tell you one thing, she's lost a baby. I can see it in her eyes. (dog barking) Bingo. - What is it? - Mrs. Chrysty Bucks. 13 Stock Road, Bonners Ferry, Idaho. 4-3-0-0-2. - Why don't we call Idaho? (phone ringing) - Hello? - [McGill] Who is this? - This is Kimmy. - [McGill] Kimmy? - Honey, where's your mommy? - [Kimmy] Mommy's gone. - Gimme the phone, Kimmy. Hello? Hello, Mom, I'm sorry I said you were stupid. Mom, please come home. - Weston. Hey, where are ya? Better be on your way home! - Mr. Bucks? Mr. Chrysty Bucks. - Okay, she's dead. How'd she do it? - Oh, she's not dead. She's not even hurt, she's fine. We just wanted to know what happened. - What happened? She just left, she just walked out a week ago. What kind of a mother abandons three kids, huh? - She left three kids. - Put her on the phone! I wanna talk to her. - She isn't here. - Why is she doing this to me? I gave her everything, did she tell you that? - No, sir, she did not. - Where are you? - We're in Silver City, Nevada. But they dropped the "City" so now it's just Silver. - Silver City, Nevada. Weston, get the map. Where in Nevada? - South. Far south. - Listen to me. You don't tell her that I talked to you, you just keep her there. You just keep her there for as long as you can, because I'm gonna come and get her. (phone clicking) - Three kids? McGill, she has three kids? - Why don't you ask him? He's comin'. - I'm gonna caution her. - Don't you dare, Linny. Now look, this isn't about you. This is between her and her husband. You understand? - You're hurting me. - McGill, I got a little crazy. I thought that she had done something horrible. - Listen to you, June. You are a mother. What could be more horrible than running out on your kids, huh? And what about you, Quinn? Linny what? Someday you're just gonna run out on Melanie? No one says a word. - She's been a friend to us. - I need to get home to my baby. - Yeah, we all need to get home. ("Danny Boy") - [Rip] Everyday babies are born and guys go off to work. Water pushes through those turbines, but it isn't everyday that people fall in love. - I don't love you. I don't even know if I like you. - God damn it, you haven't even given me a chance. I've never done this before. I mean, if I couldn't love you. - Put me down. Put me down! (wind swooshing) (moaning) Wait a minute. Wait, I'm sorry, I can't. You remind me of someone, of something. - I know, I feel it too. - No, no, shut up a minute! You don't know what I feel. You're just like my husband, you don't listen to me! - Your husband? Where's your weddin' ring? - I took it off. - Well, he must be some kind of asshole or you wouldn't be here. - No, he's not. And he wasn't. When he met me he said he found his other half. And now he honks three times when we comes home from work. It's his signal for me to open the garage door. Sometimes he doesn't even talk to me. He just honks and then goes to bed. - If I was your husband, I would bed you every night. - You're gone every night. - Oh God, don't start that feminine shit with me. Do you know how hard it is for me? I mean, I missed Nate's birth. I don't think Nate knew that I was his daddy 'til he was three years old. - Daddy and Mommy don't mean anything unless you have something to share with them. I got milk to deliver. - [Kimmy] Daddy, my doll! - [Weston] Maybe you should go... - Get your brother now. - What if she won't come back? - She doesn't even have a choice, Weston. It's not like she even has a choice. - [Kimmy] Daddy, my doll. Daddy. Daddy, Daddy. Da, Da, Da. - Weston, read the map. - It's not even on the map, Dad. - Well, just get us to Vegas then. - Las Vegas! Can I have my allowance? - You can put your seatbelt on. - Daddy, Daddy Daddy. Daddy, Daddy! - [West] Daddy, Daddy, Daddy. What is it? - [Kimmy] Daddy, my doll. (tires screeching) I have to go to the bathroom. (phone ringing) (ringback tone purring) (gentle music) - Linny. Get over here. Don't you go and do somethin' stupid. - A person has the right to do stupid things. It's a free country. They called your husband last night. He knows you're here. - Linny, would you be quiet? - He's gonna come and take you home. - What? How? Why didn't you come to me first? - I spoke to your daughter. You know, your dead daughter? - Kimmy? - You're nothin' but a walker. And what you done is wrong. - She had a reason to leave. He was cheating on you? - Did he beat you? - Never. - Then how and the hell do you justify abandoning three children? - I left them with their father. - Whoa, you are cold, Mrs. Bucks. A block of ice. - It's complicated. - Why? - I... I was making the same meatloaf that I've made every week for the past 10 years. It was just another evening. The TV was on, my husband was working, and I was making dinner. And I got to thinkin' about something. A place. A place where no one would know me. And the goddam meatloaf slipped out of my hand, and my boy was there, and the meatloaf was all red and slimy. And I had already put the tomato sauce on it, and I got to laughing, and my boy looked at me and he said, "How can you be so goddam stupid?" It was rage like I'd never felt before. I was afraid of what I could do, so I left. I got in my car and I left. You understand? - You tell us some crazy story about meatloaf. I mean, we've all felt like strangling them at one point or another. But I don't understand. - Well. Maybe I don't understand how you could get pregnant when your husband can't have babies. - Well, that's different. - Is it? The hardest thing I ever did was get in that car and leave. - You are gonna pay for what you done. God gave you a gift of three children, and you have forsaken them. - I haven't forsaken them. - Shut up, McGill! You let you kid drown. - [Woman] Linny! - It was an accident. God's work. - I asked, McGill. He fell in the pool. You never even heard his screams. - God took my child. - God brought Chrysty here to save June's baby. - All you did was catch her. Maybe she wasn't suppose to live. - McGill. - What did that mean? - She means married women who cheat on their husbands, shouldn't flaunt their sweet bastards around like prizes. - Oh Linny, why don't you just go drink some more rubbing alcohol? (screaming) (gun firing) - Linny! (groaning) - Burning me! - [Woman] Come on, Linny! - It's burning me! - It is rock salt, Linny. - [Woman] Come on, come on. Come on. (sobbing) - Where were you when my baby died, huh? Where were all of you? When my baby needed your help! (tires squealing) - [West] Okay, can I have four regular burgers with everything. - No pickles on mine. - No pickles on mine! I don't like pickles either. - Okay, two without pickles. - I want a milk shake. - Okay, four vanilla milk shakes. - Strawberry. - Chocolate. - Okay, two chocolate. No, two vanilla, one chocolate... - I want a coffee, Dad. - One strawberry milk... You don't drink coffee. - Mom let's me have half a cup of coffee every morning before school. - This isn't the morning. - Whatever, Dad. - Okay, one vanilla, one strawberry, one chocolate milkshake and a cup of coffee. - Hey, Dad, do you think I could try drivin'? - No. (dramatic music) - [Ruth] All right, good work. Don't spend it all in one place. - I'm gonna spend it over at Katie's garage. Any word on Linny? - Yeah, Quinn called. She's fine, they're not gonna keep her. They just flushed, sewed and wrapped it. They'll be back in a couple of hours. - What do I owe you? - Nothing. Be careful. If the needle hits the red, stop and let it cool down. - Thanks. (engine starting) - [Cody] I'm gonna beat you, Weston. - Let's see where it is. Where is it? Oh, almost, almost. Here it is. You need to go to the potty? Yeah? (lively music) - The weeks go so fast. - Come on. (horns beeping) - [Rip] Jesus Christ, Linny. What happened? - [Derek] Hey. What's wrong? - Nothin'. - Have another shot. Gonna be a long night. - No, she wasn't drinking. - Tripped and McGill's rifle went off. I'm so clumsy. - Goddam McGill. - I'm fine. - I'm going home. - All right, I'm gonna go drink some. - Don't forget about me. - God damn it. Linny, where are you taking me? Hell, the boys will be wondering where we gone off to. - Remember the first time? - [Shelby] That was a long time ago, Lin. - You remember? - Yeah, I remember. You were Rip's little sister. I was trying to get up the courage to kiss you. And all of sudden... - What? What is it? - It's nothin'. It's nothin'. - You're gonna have to help me this time. My wing is broken. - What ever happened to all that love we had? - Don't know. (lively music) - McGill. McGill? I'm sorry about your child. Our oldest boy almost drowned in the tub. In the bath. Luckily I got to him in time. - Ain't you lucky. - I didn't mean it that way. It's just that it can happen so fast. - The day I gave birth to my baby was the happiest day of my life. - Mine too. Nothing can change that. Nate? - I can't sleep. - You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. - You make me happy when the, when the skies are gray. - My sunshine. - [Kimmy] You make me happy. - You make me happy. - When skies are gray.
