Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. You wanna keep him? What if he's lost? Chuck: Frankie, just wanted to call and wish you a very happy birthday. I know it's been a minute. Saw that you and your mom went on vacation. That looked nice. We should go on one, one of these days. Chuck: Hey, Franklin. Just wanted to say sorry again that the whole Bahamas trip didn't pan out. The... the bombs were totally fake. They... they lied. Idiots. Anyway, next year? Love you. Chuck: Hey, Frankie. Not sure what your mom told you about what happened, but if you give me a call I can explain my side of things. There's always two sides to a story, okay? Gotta run. Uh, love you. Hey, Franklin, just wanted to call and let you know that I wasn't lying the other day. I was sick, and so that's why I had to reschedule. Anyways, I don't wanna fight. I love you. Chuck: Hey, Franklin, wanted to give you a heads-up that I'm not gonna be able to make it to your graduation today. Your mom and I, haven't been in a good spot lately and I'm thinking it's better we... do our own celebration next time I see you. Anyways, hope you're well and let's catch up soon. Love you. Chuck: I am sorry I can't be there because I would love to be there, I'm just asking, please forgive me, forgive me on this one... Just look the other way, okay? Please, don't count this one against me. Call me if you'd like. All right, bye. Chuck: Hey, Franklin, I didn't like the way our last call went. I said some stuff I shouldn't have said, and maybe you did too, and, I don't know, I'm sorry about it. Father-son stuff is tricky sometimes. Anyway, love you. Dude: Being here for the past few weeks has made me realize suicide was never the answer. So, thank you all for helping me through this. Does, uh, anyone else have anything they wanna say before we say our goodbyes? Franklin? Would you like to share? Oh, uh, no. No, thanks. Ooh, you sure? It's the last day. I, uh, took some steps in setting healthy boundaries and, uh, blocked my dad online. He lies and makes excuses. He's never really been there for me when I needed him, and I... I'm done with that. Franklin: I don't need that in my life right now. - Thank you. - Group Leader: That's great. Uh. Anyone else? Diane: Thanks again. How was that, uh, closing ceremony thing? I love myself now. But it wasn't as bad as you thought - it was gonna be, right? - Hmm, yeah. All right. Can I try driving? Now? No, you don't have a license. I know, but can I just try for just one... just one part? Diane: In a crowded parking lot? No. - Right. - Diane: No. Haley: Take care, Franklin! Franklin: Hey, uh, it's Franklin Green's voicemail. Uh... Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Franklin: Hey, uh, it's Franklin Green's voicemail. Uh, I'm not here right now, but leave a message and I'll get back to you. Thank you. Chuck: Hey, it's your dad. Um... Hey, did you delete your profile? Because it was kind of the... kind of the main way I was staying in touch with you. Chuck: I know it's not perfect, but it's something. So, uh, let me know. And, um... I... and I love you, and I'll talk to you soon. I love you. Bye. - Jimmy: You all right, Chuck? - Hey. Jimmy: No, seriously. What's up, man? - What's up with what? - You look sad as fuck. No, I don't. No. Nah... I'm pretty sure this is what a sad motherfucker looks like. My, uh... son. I've been trying to... trying to get in touch with my son and... and he's been ignoring me. Ignoring you? And I think... I think... I think he blocked me online. Okay. I mean, it happens. You know, my ex blocked me one time and I just started a different page under a different name, a whole different picture. You know. I was checking her shit all the time. She never even knew. Maybe you should come to karaoke tonight. You know, it'll make you feel better, man. Come sing with us and have some fun. - Yeah. Yeah. - Jimmy: Yeah... Real Becca: Can I help you with something? Can I help you with something? Uh... - You okay? - I'm great. Uh, see here. I'll probably get some coffee. Talkin' to people is a good start. Yeah. Let me get you something. See if we turn things around. Okay. - I'm Becca. - I'm Chuck. Okay. Jimmy: I just started a different page under a different name, a whole different picture. You know. She never even knew... What's your name? - Chuck: Becca. - Becca what? Chuck: Thompson. Soup? Nope. Nope! Oh, God. Uh-uh. Nope, I'm not... Hey, man... Shit. Sorry at work. Why am I your only friend? Fuck. My only friend. Come on. I'm... Deleted account, started new one. Why'd I delete my account? Why'd I delete my account... We don't need have to chat. So? What do you, uh, what do you think? This is the creepiest shit I've ever seen ever, like for real. This is creepy as fuck. What? Thi... This was your idea. What do you mean this was my idea? That story that you told about your... your ex and the account you made. That was my ex-girlfriend. This is your child. I am totally cut out! What the fuck am I supposed to do? Supposed to be cut out. That's what bein' cut out is. They don't want to talk to you. I just... I wanna know what's going on in his life. Okay, Jimmy, the kid tried to kill himself. I mean, what if he's already masturbating to this? Give me the phone. Becca: Sorry that was weird before. Becca: You popped up on my screen and... looked like someone I could talk to. So out of the whole internet, you started talking to me first? I was looking for someone else. Chuck: Saw we have... Saw we have the same dog. The same dog? - The same kind. - Oh. And I thought you looked nice. Well... this is definitely a first. So how's... So... - how's it goin'? - Good. Actually, I was just about to jump off my mom's roof. Just kidding. - You sure? - I'm sure. I've been there. Um... Talkin' to people's a good start. Talkin' to people's a good start. As they say. How's it goin' with you? Family stuff. So, you're having a great night too. The greatest. Anyway, it was good talkin' to you. Man: ...online presence. Who we are, versus who we display? Off that topic of social media, we're gonna bring you straight into Social Mania with Samantha Jennings. - I'm here! - I'm here too. - Feelin' better today? - I am, yeah. Listening to some public radio. Oh. - On... the radio. - Hold on. Woman: There was always some excuse... - Are you gonna... - Yup. Woman: And then I started to realize... Found it. Woman: ...that he wasn't who he said he was. It was clear. I was being catfished. This happened to me. And it happens... - Wow. - I know. Woman: A catfish is someone who creates - a fake online identity... - This is extremely boring. So boring! These people are fucking idiots! Fuck these people! Do you mind if we listen to something else? Yeah, sure. - Whatever you want. - Yeah. Woman: Nowadays, you never know who you might be talking to. Erica: What you're working on? Chuck: Oh, nothin', nothin'. - Just reports and stuff. - Are you cheating on me? - Erica? What? - Can I see your screen? - No. - Why not? - Because. - What? Are you fucking 12? I'm planning a date. For us. - Aw... - Tonight. - Aw... - Yeah. What'd you think of those pictures? - Which ones? - The ones of my pussy. - Oh. I liked them. - Yeah? You liked them? - They turned me on. - Open your mouth. Wider. Wider. Group Leader: So, from what your mom tells me, - you're doing better. - I think so. Yeah. Group Leader: Any thoughts of self-harm? - Oh, not really. - Well. That's great. Yeah. Yeah. You know, we've been talkin' about getting him back into school. I think local would be a good idea at this time. And, um, you know, I still do lock up the pills but... I feel more and more comfortable about it. I think we're moving in the right direction now, and... you know, he's never really cared about it... Talking to him about getting his driver's license... Group Leader: Uh, Franklin. Franklin? - How's that sound? - I totally agree. This is my favorite movie. This is my favorite movie in the entire world. - This is it? - This is it! Oh my God. No. No, no, no. Franklin: Okay, so... You pretty much just have to keep going, and that's that whole game. Becca: Can I try? - Franklin: If you want. - Becca: Just keep going? Franklin: Yeah, just keep goin'. Becca: You are really good at that game. You were getting pretty good too. I saw on your page you won an award for it? Yeah, it's kinda stupid, though. - Why is it stupid? - Franklin: I don't know. I guess I've always wanted to be like... a video game coder. Okay. You should apply to some places for like an internship or something. What's funny? I didn't know what else to say, so I just typed "Haha." Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Both: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Diane: What? I, uh... I met someone. Online. Oh. Really? Um, what's her name? - Becca. Thompson. - Hmm. I don't know. There's something about her. She's like... really smart. Funny. I don't know. She's just like... cool. And you've like talked to her on the phone and stuff? Obviously. Cool. That's really... it's exciting news. Wow, online. Like through friends or just random? So. I... I told some of my tech friends about you. Seriously? I hope you don't mind. No, no. That's... thank you. That's awesome. What's up? Do you wanna video chat? - N... Now? - Sure. I'm kind of camera-shy. I am, too. Well, what if we just keep to this? What if you're some old guy or something? Chuck. This is incest. No, Jimmy, it's not. I'm doing this to help him. He thinks he's in a relationship. Yeah, we talk about life and stuff. It's not like I'm trying to see his dick. Oh, come on now. I don't want to hear nothin' about your boy's dick. That's your son's dick you're talkin' about. I said I'm not trying to. If I stop now, it'll crush him. I need to see it through. Camera's broke. I'm video chatting you. - Right now? - Yes. It says it's calling you. It's not comin' through. It's still not working? It's, uh, it's being weird. I... I'll take my phone in today. Okay. Sorry. Hey. - Hey. - I like you. - I like you too. - Can I... pretend kiss you? Look, you asked for my help. Internet kiss your son. - Eww! - Jimmy: Come on. Who cares? - It's not even real! - You kiss your son, you fuck! If I had a son, - I would kiss him! - That's gross! Damn it! Look, do you love him? - Yes! - How much? - A lot! - Then fucking kiss him already! So... I'm kissing you. And I'm kissing you back. Franklin. Oh... God. Becca: Hey! Yeah. What's up? Hey, would you be up for a quick phone call? - Uh... - It's just a little weird that we've never actually talked. And it'd make me feel a lot better if we did. I'm just really busy right now. Then maybe we should wait to keep messaging until you can chat. But we were having such a fun time. Let me know. Hey, hey, hey, hey. - I have a really fun idea. - I'll do anything with you. - It's kinda weird. - I like weird. All right. So, um... ...my... my son and I have this weird tradition where we like, you know, prank call each other, and I thought it would be really funny if we like prank called him as his girlfriend. You know, really, you know, make him believe that it's her. And then, later on, I could be like, "That was me." Wouldn't he know... it wasn't her? That's the thing. They've never met. He just knows her online. - Huh. - And I was wondering... it would add a little... authenticity to the prank. Could you call him and be the voice? - I don't want to do that. - Erica. It's really, really fun. That sounds mean and stupid. No, no, no. He... he does it to me. It's like our thing. One time, he prank called me pretending to be my ex-wife. I was like, "What? No way!" Erica: It sounds like you're literally making this up right now. Thought this would actually be a fun way to... kind of bring you into my life more, but... I'll do it if you sext me at work. Oh... I don't like doing that. Hmm... I don't like doing made-up pranks to people's kids I've never met that don't make any sense. Why don't we just have regular sex? Because. You're not good at it. Hello? - Is this... - Erica: Franklin? Is... is this a good time? Yeah, I was just... yeah, sorry. I... I was... I was just... I was literally just in the middle... uh, yeah. What's goin' on? Uh, how's your day going? Franklin: Pretty good. How's it goin' with you? What are you wearing? Just sweatpants and a Red Sox shirt. - Uh, what... what about you? - Just a dress. - Franklin: Oh, awesome. - No panties. - Sorry? - Just got out of the shower. Oh, hopefully you did your laundry so that... there are clean towels. Your voice is sexy. Franklin: I'm actually not good on the phone. - Uh, to be totally honest. - What? Me neither. Do you want to just meet in person? - No, no, no, no, no. - Sure, I'd love to. Franklin: Okay, awesome. Uh, see you soon. Sounds great. See you soon. - What was that? - Yeah. What the fuck was that? - It was a game. - Tell me the truth. - I told you that... - No. Look, whatever it is, it's okay. I'll understand. - Get the fuck out! - You said it would be okay! You're a piece of shit! Lying to your son isn't gonna get you closer to him! Well, it might. I can't wait to meet you. Your counselor said that you can't travel alone for a year. And... and you don't even have your driver's license. Can you drive me then? Can I take you to meet this...? - No, I can't. I'm sorry. - Franklin: It'll be fun. I have a practice. I can't just pick up and leave. But I'll get permission from my treatment team and everything. I promise. Please. Diane: I'm sorry, honey. - I can't believe she said no. - I know. I... Hello? - Dad? - Hey. - Um, what's goin' on? - I think I need a ride. Where? Franklin: To meet a girl in Maine. Near you. - It's too far. - No, no. Uh, I just... Franklin: You don't have to explain. Chuck: There's just a lot of work stuff. Don't. Becca: I just think it's very cool that he's willing to drive all that way. I mean, what, he's got to drive all the way down to you, and then all the way back to where he lives. He must care a lot about you. Becca, my dad is fucked up. He's got something wrong with him. Everyone's got something, right? Yeah, but I don't even... I feel like I don't even know who he... like everything he does is bullshit. He's like, he... he's a compulsive liar. He doesn't sound that bad. Let me... I mean, what's a good... okay, this is a dumb thing, but I feel like it... He used to be obsessed with online chess. - We should play. - Um... Maybe later. - Yeah. - Okay. Okay. Anyway, he was playing all the time, and was the top of all these online leagues, he was winning all these awards... Wow. I mean, I would be super proud. But then one day, he shows me how he's winning so much. And what he would do is he would play against somebody online, but then be playing the same game against a computer. Whatever move this guy makes, I use that move in this game. Franklin: And he would the players' moves and use them against the computer and then take the computer's perfect moves, and then use them back against the player. And they just play against each other the whole time. And then I'm just moving right up the leader boards. He'd just cheat. And that was how he did his whole life. I'm taking a road trip with my son. - Jimmy: Chuck, she's not real! - My Becca's not real! Jimmy: What are you talking about? I'm going to introduce him to the real Becca. - The one from the diner. - Jimmy: Abort! Chuck: Let me explain! Jimmy: So your plan is to introduce your son to this random diner girl. Chuck: She's a nice girl. He's a great kid. And they're gonna hit it off! Jimmy: She's a total stranger! Chuck: She's not. She's a nice girl who makes faces at kids. She's funny. Jimmy: You're about to ruin your son's life! I'm here. Jimmy: Chuck, listen to me, okay? Come clean. Just tell him everything. Tell him and face the consequences, but don't do this. Don't be a fucking idiot, Chuck! Whatever it takes, Jimmy. - Jimmy: He's gonna find out! - Chuck: Whatever it takes. Diane: He's just, uh, finishing packing up. Place looks great! I love what you did with the... lawn. This whole thing is a dumb idea. And he doesn't even know this girl, - she could be anybody. - Totally agree. I'm gonna to talk him. I'm gonna engage. - There he is! - Diane: Got everything? Come here. Okay. Love you. Love you too. - Here. - I... I got it. Yeah. Diane: This could be incredibly destabilizing. Chuck: I know. If anything goes wrong, it's your responsibility. Trusting you. - So, how's it bein' back home? - Good. What kind of stuff you doin'? - I don't know. - Watching anything good on TV? So many shows out now, you know? Think there'll be even more shows? Like, in the future? Do I think there will be even more TV shows in the future? That's what you're asking right now? - Yeah, I don't... I don't know. - Why are you asking me that? Well, what do you wanna talk about? - Nothing. - You coding maybe? How do you know about my coding? I don't know. Your mom or something. Oh, it's my girlfriend. All right, one sec. Hello? Becca? Becca? Hello? Hey, can you hear me? Hello? Hello? Hello, Becca? So, I... I can just hear myself. I can't... hey, hello? Hello? I'll... I'll call. Uh, call me. I'll call you in a little bit. Okay. If you can hear me, okay, bye. Not there, huh? Chuck: You ready, bud? - Hey, you ready? - What are you... - Can you please not do that? - Chuck: Oh, sorry. Okay. What are you wearing? Franklin: What are you wearing? Franklin: I'm in my underwear. Franklin: I'm in my underwear. What am I doing? What am I doing? Franklin: Sorry. I was trying to talk dirty like you did on our phone call. Becca: I was being crazy. I'm not really like that. Franklin: It's fine if you don't want to. Becca: I think it's better if we wait. Franklin: I get it. I'm a loser. Becca: You're not a loser. Franklin: I am, actually. I am a fucking loser. - Franklin: I'm in here. - Yeah. Uh... How much longer? - I don't know. - Chuck: Okay. I just, um... I just wanted to let you know that I think you're awesome. Why're... Thank you. Franklin: I hate myself. Chuck: Whatever move this guy makes, I use that move in this game. And then whatever move he makes against that move, I use it back on this game. I make the guys play each other. They think they're playin' me. Chuck: Hey, you there? Erica: What? Chuck: I deleted the account and everything. You were right. Erica: You promise? Chuck: What you said made an impact on me. Erica: Wow. Chuck: And... I owe you something. Erica: Make me want it. I'm in my underwear. Well, that turns me on. Well, that turns me on. About wearing underwear. What do you wanna do to me? Chuck: Paste. Send. What do you wanna do to me? I'm kissing you. Franklin: All over. Franklin: What are you doing to me? Chuck: Kissing you all over. Don't be a fucking pussy, Chuck. What are you doin' to me? I'm sliding my hand around your cock. I'm sliding my hand around your cock. I'm kinda moving my body back and forth so your hand doesn't get tired. Back and forth to... Okay. And I'm kinda moving my body back and forth so your hand doesn't get tired. Now I'm using my mouth. Now I'm using my mouth. I'm seriously so erect right now. I'm seriously so erect right now. What? What? - Like... your boobs? - Yeah, my boobs are erect. Oh, I didn't know you were so good... - ...at doing this. - You feel so good inside me. - You feel so good too. - God, I want you inside me. - I thought I was. - You are. I'm imagining it. Franklin, I gotta use the bathroom. - Franklin: One second. - No, right now! I gotta go! - I said one second! - Franklin! What the fuck! Hey, I just gotta use the bathroom. Can't I just have a fucking second? Whoa, where is this coming from? - You're smothering me. - I'm... I'm smothering you? Franklin: You're smothering me! Chuck: I haven't seen you in a year. - Yeah, whose fault is that? - Oh, my God. Oh, you think this is funny? I send you a billion messages. I never hear back. Franklin: 'Cause that's all you do. That's all you do. You post on my wall. - You think that's showing up? - Your wife and kid hate you, how fun you think it is to show up? That's what you signed up for. - I signed up for a family. - I am your family! We're both really tired right now... I'm tired of pretending we're okay. You want to know why I cut you out? Because you're a liar. You're selfish and you're a liar. Come on. Every time you said you'd be there, you never were. Every time you could have shown up, you just cut corners and I'm sick of it! - Frank... Franklin... - I needed you. And you weren't there. You weren't there. I'm not perfect. - You're not fucking perfect. - Chuck: I just... yeah, I just said I wasn't, okay? - I'm trying. - You're really not. I'm here... now. If... if I gotta... do every little thing for the rest of my life to make up for it, I will. Let's... let's just, uh, like talk to each other. Okay? You sit there on the other chair. We can sit and talk, all right? I'm trying to rebuild from a thing that I know that I broke. I broke it. And this is the... this is me doing my best to fix it. Mom was right. This whole thing was a bad idea. Chuck: Franklin. You wanna try? Try what? Driving. - No. - Come on. - I never got my license. - It's easy. Let's switch. - Friend... - Dad, no. Chuck: All right, foot on the brake and put it in drive. Okay. When do I... Chuck: Just give it... give it some gas. Foot on the gas pedal right there. Stop. Stop, stop, stop till you have an opening. - Franklin: Okay. - Chuck: No, stop. Stop. No. This guy's a fuckin' asshole. Foot on the brake. There you go, there you go. Franklin, you're a natural. You're a natural at this. I was a mess the first time I did this. Oh my God. Okay, we're gonna switch lanes again. I want you to get in the left lane. - Okay. Left lane. - There you go. There's the signal. Check your mirrors. Everything clear? - All right, go to the left. - Check. Moving to left. - I'm moving to left. - And now turn your signal off 'cause you're in the left lane, and you did it. - What do all the lights mean? - Which ones? The one with the... the engine light. Oh, that thing's been on for a while. That... that's just to... the manufacturers make that thing go on so you'll go in and pay for more repairs. It's nothing. Chuck: Just go straight that way. That parking space straight ahead, straight ahead. There you go and put the brake pad. Chuck: And put it in park. Welcome home. Right over there. Straight ahead. - You still have that thing? - I'm never getting rid of this. You want it? - What do you mean? - The car. To keep. It's yours. Okay. Franklin: I can't stop thinkin' about last night. Franklin: You were amazing. Becca: How was the trip? Franklin: Want to finish what we started? Becca: Can't do that right now. Sorry. You're lucky you get to spend all this time with your dad. Yeah, well, if you knew him, you'd think different. My dad and I fought a lot before he passed away. It wasn't worth it. Oh my God, Becca. I'm so sorry. I... I feel like an idiot. I had no idea. Yeah, he wasn't always around either. And then one day we were having this... ...big stupid fight and... and then he just died. Heart attack. And I never saw him again. And I will never see him again. Oh, my God, Becca. And then, you know, when I started missing him, I just... I wanted to call. And I... I couldn't. I tried. I called over and over but... he was gone. Through that experience, I realized that I should have just forgiven him. And, uh, I also realized that I love him way more than I love my mom. So. Huh. Wow. That's... Wow. Remember, your dad was just some guy who ended up having a kid and is now just... trying his best. Um, apples and peanut butter almost done. Night. Good night, Franklin. Becca: Derek, you are the most thoughtful, unique, and kind person I've ever met. And... I love you. Diane: And he's doing okay? No major mood fluctuations? No, we're having a great time. Uh-huh. Well, if you notice anything off with him, please call me. Chuck: I will. Right away. All right. Well... I know this means a lot to him. Chuck: I'd do anything for Frankie. Becca: Hey there. Uh, Chuck. Right? Yeah! Hey. - Have you been helped? - Um... - Oh, shoot! Shoot! Um... - Ow. No worries. Happens all the time. Seriously. Ugh, I've been on the road all day with my son. I'm taking him to meet a girl. - Your son? - Chuck: Uh-huh. That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard. We eating today? Relationships can be so tricky though. - Tell me about it. - Chuck: Right? - Yeah. - You in one? - What? - Like, you know, - do you have a boyfriend or...? - Why do you ask? Just making conversation, I guess. I'll come back when you're ready. Okay? Yeah. Becca: Derek, you are the most thoughtful, unique, and kind person I've ever met. And... I love you. So... what's the plan? Becca? Sorry. - Hey, for a second I thought... - I'm freaking out. Is there someone else? No. What is it then? You're a great guy. I'm just... going through a lot of my own stuff right now. Like what? I'm movin' to California. What? Why? Since when? Becca: I've been wanting to for a while. How come you've never said anything? It just came up. There's a job there. Maybe even Japan. What are you talking...? Can you get on a call right now? You're gonna meet someone so incredible. I know it. Wait, are you breaking up with me? I'm sorry. She ended it. - What? - We were talking... she stopped responding... then she freaked out and said she was done. - Franklin... - I don't know what happened. I mean, if you think about it, maybe this is a good thing. What? Chuck: That you're finding this out now. I mean, she's showing you this whole different side of herself. You don't wanna be with someone like this. I mean, fuck her. Right? Don't talk about her that way. - No, I just meant... - I don't care what you meant. - That's my girlfriend. - Franklin... No, no, not fuck her. - Come on. - Fuck you. Chuck: Franklin! Franklin! What are you doing? I don't know. Becca: Franklin. I'm worried you won't like the person I am in real life. But... you are the most thoughtful, unique... and kind person I've ever met. And I love you. Jimmy: All right. Here we go y'all A little 98 Degrees. Never sang this song before in my life. I can pick any song, because that's how great I am. Whoo! Yeah! I mean, she's just special, you know? Like, look. Like, look what she said. Isn't that, like, poetic? Looks like she's saying goodbye to me. - Wait, what? - What... what is it? That tech company Becca sent my stuff to. They want to meet me for an interview. Wow! - Right? That's awesome! Oh. - Great news, man. Chuck: Yeah, that's... that's... How's it feel spendin' all this time with your pops? Oh, I gotta tell Becca about this. Can I give you some advice? Just... just real quick while you focus on that girl. - You know, you gotta... - Yeah. You can't really just invest everything into her like that, you know? You know, she could be like mean or... or a scammer, or just a liar. I mean, or your dad. Jimmy: Your dad. Oh. You know, look, I always say it's best not to, you know, think too far ahead, and, uh, you know, don't look at horses. You know? You know what I'm saying, Jimmy? Jimmy: I... I hear what you're sayin', you know... What I'm saying is keep your expectations low. Like really, really low. Don't put 'em too high, 'cause you'd get really disappointed. So, keep 'em low. This girl is the love of my life. Right, see, you're still talkin' like... the expectation's too high. Keep it low. Okay? - People can be really tricky. - Not Becca.

Oh, I would love to. Great. I'll... I'll grab a menu for you. Uh... - What's, uh, what's your name? - Becca. I'm Franklin. - Nice to meet you. - It's very nice to meet you. I will grab a menu for you. Do you wanna go over there? I'll be over there. - Real Becca: Okay. - And I'll see you soon. Okay. All right. Do you guys want any, um... would you guys like some... some cream, sugar for your coffee? Um... Great. I'll get that. And do you want me to get some more... more water? Hey, excuse me. I was wondering. - Could you help me? - What can I help you with? I was wondering what you, uh, would call the job that you have? - Busboy. - Uh, busboy. You know, that's... that's weird because, what if... what if... what if you were if you were like a girl or something? Um... I assume you're a busgirl. That's... that's funny. You are funny. All right, that was quick. Real Becca: All right. Here you go. Thank you very much. I'll get you started with water. Do you wanna hear the specials? Yeah, I'm just... I'm just here... I'm just here eating some food. Um... Yeah, we've got... we've got Belgian waffles. Uh, those are topped with strawberries, blueberries and whipped cream. The whipped cream is also house made. So... Look, I'm thinking like, you know, I really wanna, you know, do something. We should make a documentary about the lives of... of bus people. What are you talking about, man? Real Becca: Would you like syrup on the side with that? I would like syrup... everywhere. On the waffle everywhere? Everywhere on the waffle, in all the little pockets. Great. Okay, then heavy on the syrup. Put the syrup on the waffles. Put the syrup on the side. Put the syrup on my face, put the syrup on my heart. - I'm sorry? - Put the syrup everywhere. Put the syrup all over. I'm sorry, I'll stay... I'll try to stay in it with you. Let's keep... Sorry. I'll stay. I'm sorry, you're really committed to this. I'm sorry? I said, you're really committed to this. - It is my job. - Yeah. Anyone watching would be like, oh my God... - I gotta get back to work. - Totally, totally. - But... but one more. - You're actually not even - allowed to be back here. - One more thing. Dude, the Health Department would bug. You need to get out. Come on. Okay, listen, one more thing. Fuck. What was it? You were right about my dad. He is a good guy. The story you told me helped a lot. The one about your dad. Uh... The one about your dad, how he passed away? I mean, yeah, my dad's fucked up, but, I mean, he drove me all the way out here to meet you, and... I mean... he's my dad, you know? I mean, sure, he hasn't always been there but... I love my dad. And I love you. Uh, you... sorry, you're making me extremely uncomfortable. I can't do the game anymore, Becca. I'm here. I can't have you back here, just like health code stuff. Yeah, yeah. No, my dad isn't dead, and I have no idea what you're talking about... - Hey, everything... - Chuck: I feel a connection to you, man. Dude, get the fuck off! Dad, what are you doing? Derek: What the fuck is going on? I'm trying to talk to my girlfriend. I have never seen this guy before. - Derek: What is he talking about? - Becca: I don't know - what he's talking about. - What the fuck. We've got a fight over here at the diner. That's my girlfriend you're talking to. - What? - This is my fucking girlfriend! - That is not Becca, okay? - Franklin: Yes, it is. - That's not Becca! - How could you do this? Get them away from me. - Franklin: We could start fresh. - Chuck: Frank. Franklin. - We could start fresh! - I'm Becca. I'm Becca. - I'm Becca, all right? - What? What'd you say? I didn't know what to do. I didn't have a choice. - I don't know him. - I gave everything to you. He's here sometimes... When you blocked me, I started an account. I pretended to be Becca. - What is this? What is this? - Chuck: You're right, you're right. I'm a liar. And if you never wanna talk to me, I understand. I didn't know what to do. I didn't have another choice. - How do you have all this? - If I can just be honest... if I can just be honest, okay? When you blocked me, I started an account and pretended to be Becca. I'm just telling you, it was just... it was... it was just... Franklin, Franklin, it was just so that - I could talk to you, okay? - No! No, no. No. Chuck: Franklin, listen to me, please. No. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. I'm sorry. I just wanted to talk to you. No, no, no, no, no, no. Hey. Chuck: Franklin... I know you'll probably never want to talk to me again. I wouldn't either if I were you. I remember I wasn't at your ninth birthday party. You and your mom were so mad at me. This is lot worse, huh? I tried to show up this time, but I got it wrong. Again. I've missed out on so much of your life. If we could just go back to when you were little, when we'd take the ferry to Montauk, sing in the car together, wrestle. Maybe it sounds stupid, but that road trip we took together was the best time I've had in my whole life. I know you're not a kid anymore, that you're an adult now. But you'll always be my son. And even if I don't know how to be the best dad, I love you more than you will ever know. And I'll be here. In your corner. Forever. Chuck: You're doin' fine. You tired? Team Manager: Hey, uh, Franklin? Hey, sorry. I just wanted to say you're doin' a really great job. Oh. Well, thanks for the job. Team Manager: Don't thank me. Thank your friend. She was pretty adamant about giving you a shot. I'm glad we listened. Diane: Chuck. I'm writing to let you know you're a fucking asshole. But I also wanted to let you know that there's a vacancy in the apartment building across the street and it looks affordable. Anyway, fuck you. And I hope you're well. Chuck: Anyway, I just wanted to call and thank you for sending me that letter. It'll be nice to be across the street for you guys from now on. Wait, wait, what? What do you... what do you... across the street? - Are... are you serious? - The place you suggested. - What are you talking about? - In the letter. What letter? The one you sent a few months ago. What... you... You can't just move in across the street! - Diane, you told me to. - What are you talking about? In the letter! You said in the letter! I didn't send you a letter! What are you doing across the street? Oh, my God. Take those boxes and put them back in the truck. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
