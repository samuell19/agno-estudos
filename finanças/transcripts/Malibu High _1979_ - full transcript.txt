(70s folk music) - Kim? It's time to get up, Kim. Do you hear me, Kim? Kim, I'm not gonna call you again, and you're gonna be late. Kim, can you hear me? - I hear you. - Well, alright, hurry it up. That looks great. - What looks great? - Eating and smoking at the same time. - There. I can smoke and drink coffee at the same time, can't I? (car honking) - [Mom] Well, you'd better hurry, there's Kevin. - It's not Kevin, it's Lucy. - Not Kevin? Isn't he picking you up? - [Kim] No. - Why not, what happened? - I just decided not to see him anymore. - That's too bad. - Not really, who needs him? (car honking) - Don't your friends have any manners? Hurry up, I'll be getting complaints from the neighbors. - You worry about those assholes. - Kim! - Sorry. - Where are your books? - What books? - Your schoolbooks, don't you have any homework anymore? - I do my homework in school. - You do, huh? No wonder you're flunking everything. You're getting to be just like your father. If you expect to graduate, you'd better get in here every night- (door slamming) - Hey, come on, we're late. We're late, God! Oh, hey, I hate to tell you this, but there's Kevin. - Hey, that's Annette Ingersol he's with, isn't it? - [Kim] Yeah. - Wow, would you look at that car? Where did she ever get a car like that? - Her father bought it for her, where do you think? Her father's Harry Ingersol! You've heard of Harry Ingersol, haven't you? - Oh yeah... Well sure, I mean, he owns half the town. But that's a common name around here. I didn't know he was her father. - Yeah, well now you know. Now she owns Kevin, too. - I'm sorry, Kim. - Sorry for what? He's a flake and she's a bitch. They deserve each other. - Well, come on, we'd better get to history. - And so we've traced English history from the Norman conquest to the Industrial Revolution, whose birthplace was in England. Now it wasn't just chance that the Industrial Revolution began in England, it was the indirect result of a set of British laws enacted almost Can anyone tell us what those laws were? Kim, can you tell us? - What was the question? - What set of British laws led indirectly to the Industrial Revolution? - I haven't the foggiest idea. (laughing) - It is something we have covered many times in this class. - I still haven't the foggiest idea. (laughing) - Valerie, can you tell us? - Yes, the Industrial Revolution was the result of the British navigation laws under the reign of Elizabeth I of England. The navigation laws were enacted, which stated that only British ships can enter British ports. The result was- (bell ringing) - Can I see you for a moment, Kim? - Okay. - I want to talk to you about this class. - I'm flunking out, so? - Don't you care? Don't you realize that if you flunk this class you don't graduate? - Can I go now, Mr. Donaldson? If I don't get to my next class, all I'm going to get is another lecture. - Hello, Kim, what's happening? - Not much, what are you doing? - I'm just trying to finish this chapter before the bell rings. - You're awfully cold. You know, I thought we had a thing going. - We had a no thing. I just put up with you for a while, that's all. - Is that right? Well, two years is a long while. - Aw, come on, you gotta be kidding if what you thought we had was permanent. Of course, you are dumb, aren't you? I heard about your grades. You probably won't even graduate. - I don't deserve that, Kevin. Hey listen, about that dance Saturday night- Are we still going? - Well I don't know about you, but Annette and I are going. In style. Check you later. - Look, Kim, I want to know for sure whether you're going to the dance. Well, because if you're not, I'm not. - Lucy, why should I go? - I just don't want to go alone. I feel strange. - No way, I'm not going. - Why not? Well so what if Kevin's gonna be there? It'll be a great chance to show him that you don't need him to have a good time. Oh, and think of the chance it'll be to meet guys! Oh Kim, let's go, please! - Honestly, Mom, how many times have you already dusted today? - Just trying to keep things clean, and you're certainly no help. - Clean? More like antiseptic. You're always fussing, but you don't care about yourself. Look at you, you're always in that rag. - Really, Kim, what do you expect me to wear around the house, an evening gown? Or maybe one of the minx your father left me? Ha! - Don't joke about Daddy. No wonder he couldn't stand it here. You could've looked decent once in a while, instead of worrying about dirt, and dust, and greasy buildups! Maybe then you wouldn't have driven Daddy away! And maybe Daddy wouldn't have had to kill himself because he couldn't get it up anymore! (funky brass music) That flake. - Kevin? - Yes Kevin, who else would I mean? Look, I didn't want to split because of him. I don't give a fuck who he sees or what he does. I just wasn't having any fun, that's all. - Okay, so now what do we do? - Your parents are still away, aren't they? - Yeah, so? - So we hit up on your dad's bar again. - Oh, I had such big plans for tonight. - Well you're gonna have to lose your cherry on your own time. - I don't like booze that much. - Look, it's all we've got, so let's just do it, okay? - Okay. - Hey, wait a minute! - What? - There's Tony! - Oh, I get it, you want to make a small purchase, huh? - Why not? You don't like booze, there's the alternative. (horn honking) - Hey baby, what's happening? - Whatever's happening, it ain't happening in there. - No? It's still kinda early. Hey, when are you gonna start working for me? - No way. You've already got two hookers working for you. Isn't that enough? - Yeah, but neither of them's like you, mama. Look, you think about it, eh? - No. You got any stuff on you? - Is Rauquel Welch stacked? - I mean the good stuff, not the shit you sold me the last time. - No, this is the new shipment. Good stuff. Why don't you get in and we'll talk price? - We'll talk price right out here. - Come on, I can't do business like this out in the open. Besides, you want to see what you're getting, don't you? - Okay, but strictly business, right? - Oh yeah, I'm all business. Good, huh? - Yeah, okay. How much? - Well, that depends... - Business, Tony. Right? - What, is Kevin the only one good enough to make it with you? Huh? I guess he is the only dude you ever made it with. - The grass, Tony. How much? - 20 bucks. - 20 bucks, what do you think I am, the late Howard Hughes or something? - It's 20 bucks, baby, now, end of conversation. - Okay, but I've gotta get it from my friend first. - And when her strap came undone, and her top fell off, there she was, with nothing. Flat, just like a boy. I mean, I kind of felt sorry for her. If I was flat like that, I wouldn't want anything like that to happen to me. But you gotta admit, it was kind of funny the way it happened, right? What's wrong? - I just don't feel like listening to it anymore, that's all. - Okay, so we don't have to listen to it. - Do you mind if I have a drink? - No, I don't mind. Hey, but why drink when you've got this? - That stuff isn't doing anything. Maybe a drink will help. - I hope you don't get mad at me, but you are acting a little weird tonight. - Am I? - Well, aren't you? - No, I don't think so. - Look, it's Kevin. I know that it's Kevin, so why don't you just come right out and admit it? - Look, Lucy, I don't give a fuck about Kevin. He only split because he couldn't give me all I wanted, and his poor male ego got bruised. Kevin's a prick, and I don't want to see him anymore again. Never! I'm just glad I found out about him, and myself. Things are much clearer. And I'll tell you another thing, Lucy. Starting tomorrow, you're gonna see some big changes in me. - What do you mean? - Man, I'm sick of this shit. I'm sick of the shit I take from Kevin. Sick of the shit I get at home, in school. No more. Starting tomorrow, there's gonna be some big changes. - Well, I still don't know what you're talking about. What do you mean, a new you? - I'm gonna be a new woman. Right now I'm flunking out of half my classes, right? No more. I'm gonna get the highest grades, and studying isn't gonna have anything to do with it. And I got no money, right? I'm gonna have money. And I'm gonna get them both the nicest fucking way I know. (creepy bell music) Daddy? Daddy, are you awake? Daddy, can I talk to- You just wait. I'm gonna have all the things my dad couldn't. - Oh Christ, you're still stuck on your dad? Jesus, it's been nearly two years. Why don't you let go? - Just watch. Starting tomorrow's gonna be a whole new scene. (door knocking) - [Mom] Kim! Kim, it's that time again. Kim! - I'm already up, Mother. - [Mom] Already up? Are you sure? - Would I be talking to you like this if I wasn't? - You're not going to school like that, I hope. - Why not? - Well, for one thing, they'd send you home. - Don't you know there are no dress codes anymore? - Well, I don't care. This is ridiculous. Now you march right back to your room and change. - Look, Mom, I'm 18 years old, and I can do whatever I want, so just get off my case, okay? (wolf whistling) (cat calling) (bell ringing) - Kim. May I see you for a moment? - Sure. - Would you mind closing the door? - Shall I lock it? - That won't be necessary. - What'd you want to see me about, Mr. Donaldson? - I think you know what it's about. - No, I don't. - What's the idea coming to class dressed like that? - I had nothing else to wear. - Don't tell me that, Kim. I know better than that. - What's wrong with it? - You disrupted the class, that's what's wrong with it. There were more eyes on you than there were on the blackboard. - Is that so terrible? - Would you try to keep in mind that this is a place of learning, not a beauty contest? I'm surprised you haven't been called into Mr. Elmhurst's office! - I was hoping I'd turn you on a little, Mr. Donaldson. - What? - I dressed this way just for you. Don't you know you're my favorite teacher, Mr. Donaldson, and I've always had a thing for you... - What's the meaning of this? I think you'd better get out of here. - Why, am I getting to you? I hope. - Would you please leave, Kim. - Sure. What are you doing after school? - What I'm doing after school is hardly any of your business. - If you're interested, I'll be at High Point. - I'm not interested. - Think about it, huh? High Point. I'll be there, alone. - Come on, Kevin, let's go. Can't you get your eyes off of that slut? - That's right, Kevin, you'd better hurry up before she takes away your allowance. What did you call me? - You're nothing but a cheap slut. - Bitch, at least I don't have to pay for it. - You couldn't afford to, dearie. Let me know if you need a loan. - Hey, wait a minute, there's Tony. I gotta talk to him for a second. Back this thing up. - Peace, bye bye. Woo, Kim, Jesus. Is that you? I mean... Is that really you? - Yeah, Tony, that's really me. Listen, I gotta see you later tonight, okay? - Okay, but why wait til tonight? You're seeing me right now. Get in. - Haven't time. But I want to meet you later, alright? - Okay. Hey, wait wait wait a minute, what's this all about, anyway? - I decided I want to make some money. I want to talk business with you. - Oh, so you're gonna finally make that hot body of yours pay off, huh? Dynamite. Want me to pick you up at your house? - No, not there. I'll meet you at the parking lot of the disco, okay? - Alrighty, what time? - Nine o' clock. - Okay, I'll see you at nine. - Bye. - Bye bye. - What was that all about? - Nevermind. Hey, can you take me to High Point? - High Point, why? - I gotta meet someone there. - Way up there? Who? - What is this, 20 questions? Just take me there, okay? I'll tell you later. Over here, Mr. Donaldson! Look, Tony, the girl usually gets 60 percent, right? That's all I want! - Well, you're getting 40 and that's it. I'm getting you the business, aren't I? You're using my van, aren't you? What the fuck you want? - Okay, 50. - What are you, deaf or something? I said 40, 40, 40! 40 for you and 60 for Uncle Tony. You don't like it, you get yourself another business manager. - Okay. And no more rough stuff, huh? And I can't work during school hours. - What, are you kidding me? I thought you were dropping out. - I intend to graduate with top grades. - What's so important about school? - It's important to me, okay? - [Tony] Okay, whatever. Let's try out the bed. - What? - Look, honey, I gotta know what your action's like. If it's no good, I can't sell a bad piece of ass. - My action's good, Tony. It's real good. You don't even have to worry about that. - Look, honey, when you buy some stuff from me, you sample it first, right? Right? Well, it's the same with me. I gotta know what your action's like, or the whole fucking deal is off. Now let's go in the back. - Okay. I will take you up there once more. But I'm not gonna say that I like it. - Look, you're not gonna have to do it much longer. Pretty soon I'll have enough money, and I'll be able to get my own car. - But do you really know what you're doing, Kim? I mean, really know? - No lectures, huh? - But you're a hooker! - So what, it's better than giving it away, isn't it? Come on, let's go, Tony's probably already there. - Hi. - How are you doing? - Alright. You just made it, here he comes now. - Hello there. - Hi. - This is Mr. H. Why don't you treat him good, okay? Mr H, 50 bucks. Now, come on, up front. - Oh, of course, of course. - Thank you, Mr. H. Okay, I'm gonna go across the street to the hot dog stand. You guys have a good time, okay? - Let's get it on. Which way do you want it? - [Mr. H] I prefer the French way, if you don't mind. - [Kim] Sure, why not. Beats the Greek way. - Kim, that's the best. - Feeling's mutual. Haven't had enough, have you? - Paid the man for one serving. Didn't know this was a smorgasbord. - I'm ready whenever you are. - Alright- - Wait a second. No freebies. Pay me cash direct, and I'll give you a discount. - So, finally found some time for me, huh? - The next report cards are about to come out. I want you to know what grade I expect. - Expect? What grade do you expect? - An A. - An A? Well, you really reach for the moon, don't you? - I reach for it, and I get it. - You're gonna get just what you deserve. You're out of your mind, you know that? You haven't turned in any homework since you've been in this class, you've failed every test. You're getting an F! An F for flunking, F for failure. - F for forget it, you'll reconsider. - Maybe you think so, but that's exactly the grade you're getting. - Have you forgot about our little get together that afternoon at High Point? - No, I haven't forgotten. I also haven't forgotten that you haven't had any time for me for the last six weeks. Anyway, I told you at the time that insofar, as your grade was concerned, that that wouldn't have any effect on it. I meant it then, and I mean it now. - You better think about it, Mr. Donaldson. I mean, you are a married man. - So here it comes, huh? Well, I'm way ahead of you, Kim. Nobody knew we were out there together, and nobody saw me headed that direction. So please, don't make a fool out of yourself and go to my wife. - As Sherlock Holmes would say, Mr. Donaldson, you've left out one minor detail. That small detail happens to be the half moon birthmark on the cheek of your ass. I wonder how your wife would feel about me knowing about that, Mr. Donaldson. So I get an A. Right? You'll have to excuse me, Mr. Donaldson. I'm headed for my second favorite class. Physics. I'm gonna pull an A in that class, too. - So one cancels the other, as you see. The zeroes go on and on and cancel each other ad infinitum. You do see this, don't you? Morris, would you explain this to the class? (bell ringing) Yes, Kim, may I answer a question for you? - What I want to know is how I'm doing in this class. - Well, you certainly ought to know how you're doing. Not very well. It's time you showed some concern. As of now, you're failing. - That's what I thought. I don't understand physics, Mr. Mooney. I just don't understand it at all. - Well, Kim, you have to study harder. You have to put your mind to what you're doing. - I need extra help, Mr. Mooney! - Well, I could recommend some excellent books. - No, I mean personal help. Couldn't we get together after school? - Well, I don't think so... My time is limited. - Do you know where High Point is? - High Point? Well, yes, why? - I'll meet you there. It's the perfect spot for a little special tutoring. You will be rewarded. - Kim, that's out of the question! Completely out of the question! - I'll be waiting for you, Mr. Mooney. - She's a piece of shit! How could you have ever gone around with a piece of shit like that? - She's just trying to prove something, okay? Don't let her bug you, huh? Come on, let's go. - She's proving something, alright. She's proving she's a piece of shit! - Annette, will you forget about her already? - Okay, but she's still a piece of shit. Oh, those earrings! I nearly forgot! - What earrings? - Those earrings on sale, don't you remember? I said I'd pick them up today. - So what's the big deal? We'll pick them up on the way to the beach. - I don't have the money. I need 150 dollars. - Well, don't look at me, baby. - What I mean is I'll have to get the money from Daddy. We'll have to go by his office, but I'd better change first. Come on, get in. - Hello, Mr. Mooney. I'm glad you could make it. - Listen, asshole. Get that payment over here, and get it over here fast, you understand? Otherwise, you're gonna be walking around in crutches the next couple of months. (door knocking) Yeah. - Excuse me, Mr. Ingersol? Your daughter wants to see you. - Annette's here? Why don't you bring her in? - She's with somebody. A kid, I don't know who he is. He said his name is Kevin. - Yeah, that's her boyfriend. He's alright, bring em in, bring em in. Hey! Hello, sweetheart! What a surprise! - Hi, Daddy! - Kevin, how are you? Been taking good care of my little girl? - Trying to, sir. - To what do I owe this unexpected visit? - Daddy, I need 150 dollars. - Oh, you do? - Yes, can I have it now? - Well, may I ask what it's for? - For a pair of the most fabulous earrings you ever saw! They're on sale, and I said I'd pick them up today. - That seems like a pretty good investment. Let's see, here's a couple of big ones. And you can keep the change. But you gotta think of me every time you wear them! - Oh, Daddy, you're super! Thanks again! - Bye, baby. - Bye bye. - Hey, Annette? We're gonna get to the beach, don't you think we'd better get rolling? - Just a minute, Kevin! Well, what do you think? They look fabulous, don't they? - Yeah, they sure do. - I meant the earrings! - Fabulous is right. - Come on, Kevin, we've got to get to the beach. - Oh, let's forget the beach. - Thought you wanted to go surfing. - Let's make our own waves right here, huh? - I don't understand you. Don't understand anything. You never seem to study anymore. Don't you have any homework? - I already did my homework. I had a field assignment. - I don't know, I just hope you graduate. Do you know how hard it is to get a good job these days? - Don't worry. I'll get the diploma. Not that I really need it. In case you haven't noticed, I already have a pretty good job. I gotta get to work. - That's another thing. That expensive new car, and those clothes. How do you afford them? What is it you do? - How many times do I have to tell you? I'm doing relief work. - Hi, Kim. - Hi. Do I know you? - No, but I know you. - Oh? - Let me explain. I know Tony. I saw you with him once. But you didn't see me. Anyway, I know all about you. - Oh, you do? Is that good or bad? - It's good. - Then I take it you want to do business? - Yeah, but not the kind you think. You see, I'm in the same business Tony's in, only on a lot bigger and better scale. I do business only with the most important people. I'd like to make you a deal a lot more profitable than the one you have with Tony. - No, I'm satisfied where I'm at. Thanks, but no thanks. - I don't expect you to make a decision right now. Give it some thought. The name is Lance. Give me a call when you're sick of Tony. - It's all there, you don't have to count it. - From now on, Tony, I want more money. - So now comes the time to hold me up, right? - No, I just think I deserve a bigger cut, that's all. - Deserve a bigger cut? You deserve shit! You're lucky to be getting what you're getting. You fucking broads are all alike, you get the taste for a little bread then you want it all. - I don't want it all, I just want a little bit more, that's all- - That's all you're gonna get, you're not gonna get another fucking nickel. Oh, you don't like it? Well, you can just get yourself another agent. Now get the fuck out of here. Bitch. - Hey, you're gonna be terrific. - And I get 60 percent of the take, right? - That's right, baby. And the rates are a hell of a lot higher than what you've been getting from those bums Tony's been fixing you up with. I do business only with the most important people. Is that okay? - Sounds fine. - And lots of fringe benefits, too. - Oh yeah, like what? Is that what I think it is? - It is, and it's the best. Want to try some? - Sure! - And maybe afterwards, we can get to know each other. - Maybe. Hey Tony, this is Kim. Yeah, I got a message for you pal. Get fucked. (door knocking) - Come in. You're from the agency. - That's right. My, my, they certainly outdid themselves this time, you're a dream come true. - Thank you, sir. - Call me Wen. And what's your name? - Kim. - Kim. Kim, a beautiful name for a beautiful girl. Can I fix you a drink, Kim? - Just coke, thanks. - Coke? Alright. You're new at the agency, aren't you? - Well, I just started recently. - So you know what to expect? - Well, I'm not that new. I mean, I know we're not going to the opera. - We're going to get along very well together. Very well, indeed. - Hey, what is all this stuff? - Oh, they didn't tell you what to expect. You're in for a big surprise. - What the hell is going on here? Are you crazy? - So you stabbed him full of holes. - What else could I do? The way he came at me, that look in his eye. Nobody treats me like that. - I didn't know, honest. Well, look, we do get some weird hosts. They call them eccentrics. - What are we going to do? - Hey, look, baby, don't sweat it. I take care of my girls. We just simply get some puppet to take the rap. There's always some fink the boys are trying to get rid of. - No, it's weird. I'm all scary. I don't feel bad. I feel almost good about it. For once, I didn't just sit back and get hurt. I struck back. When I think of all the shit I took from Tony, that son of a bitch. - Hi. - Hi. - Back early, aren't you? - Yeah, Mr. Whatever-His-Name-Is didn't show. - He didn't? Well, that's the way it goes sometimes. What are you doing, just relaxing? - Mmm-hmm. - Well, I hope not too much. - No, not too much. What's that? - That's a present for you. - It is? What is it? What the hell is it? - What the hell does it look like? - It looks like a gun, is it real? - Of course it is. You can't go bumping off people with an ice pick. It's too clumsy. - What are you talking about? - Kim, I saw the look in your eye yesterday when you talked about Tony. Now, you can do both of us a favor. Waste him. - You're kidding, of course. - No, I'm not. He's got a contract out on him. Tony's a smartass. And he's been ticking off the wrong people. Feels nice, doesn't it? - Yeah. Kinda. But I don't need it- I mean, I don't want it! Look, even if I should decide to waste Tony, I mean, couldn't I just use your gun? I don't plan on making a habit out of this. - Baby, you're gonna dig this action. I can tell. You've got the constitution for it. All you have to do is take care of some of your personal affairs, and then I can get you some more jobs. - I can't do it, Lance. I mean, I may be a hooker, but I'm not a hit girl. - Well then, it's time you graduated. Look, there's nothing to it. Someone's all set up to take the rap for Tony's death, and we continue to protect you. And you're gonna make money. Big bucks. - How much money? Enough to get my body out of hock? - There'll be no more dirty old men for you. Except one. Me. - Well, you feel good. The money sounds good. But I don't even know how to use that thing! - Well, I'll teach you that. - Lance, can I move in with you? - Sure, hey, why not? You spend most of your time here anyways when you're not going to school or out there doing your thing with those dirty old men. Hey, alright! - Not too shabby, huh? Five times in a row. Let me try it one more time. - Oh, no, no, no need to. - Why not? - Well, you'll be at close range tonight. You can't miss. - Tonight? - Yeah. It's all set up. Nervous? - Nah, guess not. Guess the idea of that creep looking down this barrel appeals to me so much. - Atta girl. Come on. - Somebody here? - Hi, Tony. - Hey, Kim, baby. What the hell are you doin here? - I got a message for you. I came to tell you you're not wanted anymore. This is gonna be a pleasure, baby. (phone ringing) - Hello? In the driveway? Okay, great. Right. Okay, bye bye, thanks. Oh, hi! - Hi. - Didn't I tell you everything would go smooth, huh? - Yeah, you were right. You were right about another thing, too. I really got off on the power of that trigger. Now when do I get paid? - Right now! Come on! It's yours, doll. Happy motoring. - Lance, it's super! - You're super, honey. - Come on, let's go out for a ride. - Well, not now. You've got an errand to do first. - [Kim] What do you mean? - Half the car's for last night. The other half's for the next job. - What job? - There's a guy down on Elm Street who runs a jewelry shop. He owes heavy, and he's run out of warnings. - You want him dead, and you want me to do it? - He's got a roving eye. Go see him. Arrange to meet him in a nice, quiet spot. You know what to do next. - I still don't see what you want from me, sis. - Like I said, I've heard so much about your charms. You game for a little game? - You kidding? That's an offer hard to resist. - Then don't. When can we meet? - You're serious? Okay then. - You know where High Point is? - Yeah. - Why don't you meet me there tomorrow morning, early. I gotta go to school afterwards. - Okay. - Okay, see you then. - Well, I'll be damned. I thought this was some kind of a joke. - Oh no, I'm serious. Dead serious. - Far out, is this really yours? - Yep, it's all mine now. - Did you hear what happened to Tony? - Yeah, I heard. - That was really weird. Well, at least they got the killer. - Hey, let's go, okay? You go on ahead, Lucy. I'll be there in a minute. There's something I gotta do. - And so, Churchill took this great risk in order to open up... Open up relations with... With the French, and, uh... (bell ringing) Kim, you gotta wait a minute. - What is it this time, Mr. Donaldson? - This concerns you. It's from the principal's office. Mr. Elmhurst wants to see you first thing in the morning. - What for? - He hasn't been fooled by these grades you've been getting. You can screw the teachers, but you can't screw the school. - Wanna bet? That deaf old bastard should have been retired 20 years ago. - [Mr. Elmhurst] Yes, come in. - Miss Bentley is here to see you, Mr. Elmhurst. - Oh, little overnight genius. - Yes. - Well, send her in. - Yes, sir. - Hello, Mr. Elmhurst. - How are you, Miss Bentley? - The best, sir. Thank you. You wanted to see me? - No, I ... Well, it's just as well you're here. I did want to see you anyway. - Why? - Why? It's about your grades, Miss Bentley. Truly remarkable. I'd like to commend you on the tremendous improvement you've made in most of your classes. I say, I'd like to commend you, but obviously I can't. - I don't understand. - I'm glad you do. - I said I don't understand. - Oh, well, neither did I , so I looked into the matter, and, well, Miss Bentley, all A's in all of your classes, except Miss Damon's English class? That did seem rather odd to me, doesn't it to you? - No, not really. - [Mr. Elmhurst] I beg your pardon? - I said I don't see what's wrong. - You'll have to speak up. And please, don't be timid. - I don't see what's so odd! - And you needn't shout, Miss Bentley. I'm not deaf, you know. I don't see what power this is you have over your other teachers, but Mr. Mooney was able to shed a little light on it. - I don't know what the hell you're talking about. - Don't play games with me, Miss Bentley. I know all the tricks. I have heard them all, and I've seen them all. And don't delude yourself into thinking that you... You... (coughing) That means expulsion, Miss Bentley. But first I'd like to discuss the situation with your mother. When can I see her? - She works in the daytime, sir. It would have to be at night. - Tonight? That'll be fine. About when would be the best time tonight? - Anytime after eight. - And, tell me... When do you eat? - After eight o' clock, okay? - That'll be fine. Tell your mother to expect me. You may go now. - Hey, Kim. - Yeah. - You know, what you did in the parking lot was really uncool. - I don't know what the hell you're talking about. - I'm talking about this. That's what you gave Annette, for no reason at all. - Oh yeah? Well, I'm giving you this, for plenty of reasons. Wow! - Oh, Kim. I want to give you some things to do while I'm gone. You did remember that tonight's my club night, didn't you? - Sure did. You look great! Is it a big occasion? - The monthly dance. Who knows, maybe I'll meet some cavalier gentleman. - Jeez, listen to you. A good looking woman going to places where they have nothing but old fuddy duddies. - You know, you're right, for once in your life. The class of people we get are... Maybe I shouldn't go. - No, no! I mean, you might as well! You'll probably have a good time. I want you to go. - Are you sure? Okay. (doorbell ringing) - Come in. - Hello, Mr. Elmhurst. - Miss Bentley. - Oh, sorry, I just got out of the shower. - I just came to see your mother. - She's gone out for groceries. She'll be back in a minute. May I take your coat? - I beg your pardon? - Your coat! - Oh, no, I'll only be a short time- - Please, sit down. - Thank you. - Will you excuse me for a minute? I'll be right back! (toilet flushing) - You did tell your mother I'd be here? - Relax, Mr. Elmhurst. Enjoy the view. - Listen here, young lady... I don't know what you're up to, but please, whatever it is... You stop this nonsense right now! - I don't see any nonsense, Mr. Elmhurst. Unless, of course, you can't do anything about it. Is that the problem, huh? - My pills... My coat! My pills, please! Please! (coughing) - Don't I deserve an A now, sir? Goodbye, Mr. Elmhurst. Hello, hello? Oh God, he's had a heart attack! Send an ambulance, please! 2455 Pine Street! Hurry, please! You should've seen that old bastard. He was shaking like a bowl of jelly. You know, I don't know if he was more terrified of dying or disappointed because he couldn't grab a handful. - Christ, Kim. That sure sounds raunchy. - Oh, come on. I did him a favor. When the doctor came, he said he'd had four previous heart attacks. Is that any way to live? - I still don't understand why. - Let's just say he was a thorn. I'm gonna graduate from that school, and I'm gonna make it at the top of my class. - Terrific. - Then maybe we could go somewhere, huh? - Sure, why not? Where? - I don't care, just someplace. - How about Tahiti? - You're kidding! - No, why would I kid? - Tahiti? - Why not? - Sounds great! When do we leave? - I don't know, how about after you graduate? - Oh, Lance, I'm gonna get the most fantastic tan ever! - What are you doing? - It looks like I'm packing, doesn't it? - Don't get flippant with me! I'm still looking for an explanation of what happened that afternoon with your principal. - What is there to explain? The doctor already told you! He had a heart attack! - Well, what was he doing here? - He came to tell you about the great progress I was making in school. - Where are you going? And when will you be back? - I won't be back, and where I'm going is none of your business! - Now you listen to me, young lady. I'm still your mother, and I have a right to know. - Do me a favor, Mother, okay? Shove it! - Everything in? - Yep. - I hope you left me a little room in the closet. - I did. - Tomorrow, that dude goes on trial for wasting Tony. - Mmm-hmm. Guess that's the way it goes. - Hey, the jerk had it coming. So he didn't snuff Tony, so what? He snuffed a lot of other guys he didn't get nailed for. You gotta look at it that way. - I guess so. Hey, I know this is a fast crowd. Will that happen to me, too? I mean, will I get away with things now and they get nailed for something I didn't do? - Now you're talking dumb. That only happens to rotten apples. It shouldn't get to you. - It doesn't get to me. It's just that sometimes, I... I don't know who to trust. I feel all alone. - Kim, forget it. I'm with you for keeps. You hungry? - Who wouldn't be after all that moving? - Well then, why don't you start fixing din-din. - Din-din? I thought you were taking me out for din-din. - Did I say that? - You said that! And I said I'd be real good to you later if you did. Real good. - Well, in that case, I'd better take you out! - See, I can cook, too! - Bacon and eggs? Even I can cook bacon and eggs! - Well, I can cook other things! You'll find out. Hey, I gotta go, I'll be late for school. See you later. - School. - Hello, Mr. Donaldson. Awful thing about Mr. Elmhurst. I still can't get over it. - Where have you been? - I've been moving out of my old lady's house, Lucy, I have the greatest news! I'll tell you about it later. To think, just a couple weeks ago, I was down in the dumps. Now all this, and Tahiti soon. - First you graduate, and then you take care of a little project. - Huh? - You hear of Harry Ingersol? - Harry Ingersol? You want me to waste Harry Ingersol? - That's right, baby, that's right. - Oh, that's beautiful. Justice. Sugar daddy himself. - Hey, what the hell has gotten into you, anyway? - Nevermind, Lance, it's a long story. - Look, Harry Ingersol's a bum. His head has gotten too big, and Chicago wants a hole in it. He deserves to have a hole in it. I don't understand you. What's gotten into you, anyway? The idea seemed to appeal to you last night! - I told you, it's a long story. Besides, I'm scared. He's a big man in this town, he's got friends! - You'd even be more scared if you knew what might happen to you if you don't come through! Now, the boys who have been supporting you aren't nice when they've been crossed. Look, Harry Ingersol has shit. He's got boys on a payroll, and when that payroll stops, they just fade away. Wasting him is so easy it hurts. You do it at his beach house. That's where he meets his chicks. No one will even know it's you he's meeting there. It's a simple routine thing, all it takes is a phone call. - But he carries a gun, doesn't he? I mean, he must carry a gun! - [Lance] I don't give a fuck if he's carrying an atom bomb! He won't be suspicious, and he won't have a chance to use it! There's absolutely nothing that can go wrong! - Okay. - It's a piece of cake, believe it! - And after I do it, and after I graduate, we go to Tahiti. Right? - Sure, we take off, and you can spend a whole month baking in the sun, and get the most fantastic tan ever. (door knocking) - Come in, it's open. Kim? Harry. Let me show you the view. Well, how do you like it? - Not bad. - Not bad at all, not bad. The cream of the crop. Perfection. Oh yeah, we're gonna have fun. Little drink, baby? - No thanks. - Never mix business with booze. You're a real pro. - Go ahead and have one if you like. - I think I will. Celebrate what's coming up. - Yeah, Harry. Big surprises ahead. - Well, here's to you. - Here's to you, Harry. - Hey... What... What's going on? - This is goodbye, Harry. - Okay, why don't you guys unload the stuff, and I'll go tell my father we're here. - She's dead. You two stay here. Neil, come on. Oh, Jesus Christ. That crazy broad. She's gone insane. Quick, call the police. I'm gonna go after her. Kim, listen to me. Maybe you're hurt, but this is crazy. - You're a riot, you know? A million laughs. You think this has anything to do with you or jealousy? - Kim, listen. You've got it all screwed up. Let's talk, huh? - Oh, now you want to talk, huh? Now you have time for me. - Yeah, that thing with Annette... Listen, she was just a... She was a... Jesus, Kim! - Some more, Kevin, I love it when you squirm. - Bitch. God damn stupid fucking broad! Why don't you just shoot that thing? - Sure, creep. Why not? (gunshot)
