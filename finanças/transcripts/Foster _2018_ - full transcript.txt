For me, he was like a friend that I could go to. This is the Olympic doctor. I was brainwashed to believe this was a valid medical procedure. Wow! What have you done? So many people came forward. They're taking back their voice but they shouldn't have had to use it. Remember what you have witnessed... because everything is what these survivors are worth. Child protection hotline. This is Candice speaking. How can I help you? Child protection hotline. This is Crystal. Hi. This is Steve Reid. Child protection hotline. How may I help you?

What's the allegation here? Mm-hmm. Okay, so, we-- Ma'am, you need to slow down a little bit. Um... Okay, and what were the concerns that were expressed to you? Denyshia? Get up, baby. Good morning. Sydney, you wanna get up and start making your bed, baby? Get up. Denyshia will be out in a minute. Okay. Adrienne? Adrienne? Come on, baby, time to get up. I'm tired. I know you guys are tired, but you gotta get up. Casi? Come on, baby. Sleeping good. Oh, you're being silly. I've been a foster parent for at least 27 years. I've had all kinda kids that come in and outta my home, but I try to conquer them all. Makes me feel good when I get a child that I have really helped. I don't want a child that I'm not doing nothing for. They're just here eating and sleeping and going to school. I like challenge, and I think I mighta asked for too much challenge... ...'cause sometime I really get it. But, uh... so far, so good. Okay, it's time for our morning prayer. Okay, you guys grab hands. You wanna pray first, Sydney? Yeah. God, protect us every day. Keep us safe. Amen. -What a-- a quick prayer. Denyshia, do you wanna do it? Casi, you wanna pray? Okay, go on. Very good. Very good, Casi. Only God knows what you're saying, but that's very good. Lord, we ask you to bless these kids as they leave this morning going to school. Ask you protect them, Lord, and keep them safe in their classroom, on the playground. Let them be respectful to their teacher. Bless your knowledge, Lord. Let them be, uh, alert in what they're doing in class. -Amen. -Amen. All right. I was about eight when I got in foster care. My parents were doing drugs and stuff. Like, they were just drinking, drugs, being bad. I was abandoned, and I was, um, abused, and I was mistreated, and, like, no one showed that they cared for me. I've been here going on five years. At first, I was very depressed. I didn't think, like, no one would ever want me, and that, like, something was wrong with me, and, uh... I didn't, like-- I don't know-- I didn't, like... I didn't know that I could actually be loved again, or ever. So, what do you have upcoming? This is my 17-year-old. Almost gonna be 18. Yes, just graduated high school. This is a kid who doesn't have parents, doesn't have mentors, who doesn't have anyone who's been consistent in his life. You've had him for a while now. What, two years? Yep. To see him trust me is a big deal to me. Sometimes I feel like I'm so close in age to my kids that they're, like, not-- they're not gonna respect me, or they're not gonna be able to take information from me, but in a lotta ways, I feel like it made me more trustworthy to them, and so when I gave him advice, he actually took it. Well, I never wanted to be a social worker. That's for sure. A lot of my youth was spent in the child welfare system. I hated the system, and I hated social workers. I had a lot of negative things to say about DCFS, and everyone would say, "You need to walk in their shoes. You don't know what it's like on the other side." And to really be a true advocate, you need to know where the other side is coming from. When I started this job, it was very humbling because, like, you don't know anything. You don't know anything but what they choose to tell you, and, hopefully, some of that is the truth, so you can try to provide some services to the family. This job is hard as hell. This is Larry Petrosky. Reporting abuse? Yes, sir. -You a mandated reporter? -I am. And who abused the child It's a substance-exposed infant. Mother tested positive for what? Cocaine. What about the baby? The infant's urine is negative, but we missed the first one, and the meconium is pending. Baby still at the hospital? Yes, sir. And when gonna be discharged? They will both be ready for discharge 12/04. That's tomorrow. When I get a referral from the hotline, I will get basic information about the family, what the safety concern is, what the allegations are. It's considered an immediate response referral because of the discharge date for the child. We don't wanna send a newborn home with a mom who potentially has this cocaine addiction. I always had a passion for children and being a voice for the voiceless. That's why I became a social worker. I always compare being a DCFS social worker like being in the Marines, 'cause we're out in the field, in the front lines. The social worker came in. Chris is asking, like, "Why is there a social worker here?" The social worker had told me that I tested positive for cocaine, and that when my daughter, you know, when my daughter comes, that they're gonna test her. And so... I-- the first question I asked is, "Are they gonna take her from me?" There's baby Kris'Lyn. And then the next day, that's when the emergency worker came, Jacqueline, and that's when she started asking us questions. I came up with a story. It wasn't a lie. We did go to a friend's house, and I told her that there was drugs there. They were smoking the cocaine. And I told her just this big old lie. Chris was scared, so I told him to just go along with it, because he didn't know I use. I talked to mom, and then I talked to dad, and they gave me the same story, that... she tested positive for cocaine because of secondhand smoke. So, after talking to the medical professionals, they tell me that's not possible. And so, at that point, we have concerns for mom's drug use, and we also have concerns that dad's not gonna be protective of the baby and because it seems like he's covering for her. I felt betrayed, lied to. I left. Went for a walk. I was just thinking. She's been here with me, dealing with me, for five years. This is her first time she ever really, really messed up. I took dad outside, and says, like, "Look, we're going for a removal order, so you need to be honest with me. Does she have an addiction? Is she using?" And he continued to say, "No, no, no. I don't know anything." We have this short amount of time to make this decision whether we can release the baby to the father, and at that time, with the information that we had, we couldn't ensure the safety of the child in the care of the father. So we moved forward with the removal order. I was born a drug baby. My mom was on cocaine, crystal meth. I got taken away right away and put into the foster care system. I went from home to home to home to home, sometimes with my sister, sometimes not. Overall, I have been in about... I don't know, 16, 17, 18 homes. I've always called every single one of my foster parents Mom and Dad, but, like, I always knew that my real mom was the lady that we'd visit. Hey, Mary. -Jennifer. Nice to meet you. -Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Mary. I'm your attorney. This is Sondra. -Hi. Nice to meet you. -Hi, Sondra. How you holdin' up? Um, I'm okay. So, what's kinda different about what we do now, versus when you were younger, is you're in a new court. It's called a non-minor dependent court. It's for kids 18 to 21 that have experienced foster care. Your judge is a real pioneer because she saw the statistics of how bad it was for youth when they were leaving the foster care system. So she has her very own court dedicated to you guys. The other really cool thing is that we have peer advocates, and do you mind telling her what that's about? Yeah. We've all grown up in, um, the foster care system, and I didn't get much support, so I just-- I wanted to be that person that, um, you know, gave the resources and stuff, 'cause it was hard. Can I ask? And you don't have to answer, but, um, I'll ask, 'cause it sounds like it's still kinda hot for you, -very triggering, is-- -What? Is, like, um, your mom. Did you see or visit your mom when you were little, -before you went home? -Yeah, she was really nice. She was a nice lady, and then I moved in, and first day, she was sweet and everything. I remember the third day is when it all started happening. But then I was there for like a year and a half, and the cops showed up, and they checked everybody. They checked our bodies and everything, and I was the only one who, like, had something from, like, head to toe, covered in, like, bruises, and cuts, and scars, and stuff like that. So, then they were just like, "Oh," and then they took us all away. Then we went to court, and they put me on the stand, and they asked me to-- to share the story. Like, tell 'em what's going on. What's going on at home? What's this? What's that? But my mom was sitting right there in front me, and I couldn't-- I was terrified of her. So, I was like, "No, nothing, nothing. Everything is fine. Good, good, good," right? And, um... they put my sister up, Yesenia, and then she said everything. And then they let us go back home with her that day. I don't know why. But then one day, out of nowhere, some social workers showed up, and they were like, "All right, pack your stuff," and then they took me, and I went to my grandma's house and I never went back. I never understood her, and I still don't. There were moments where, um... she liked to go clubbing a lot... ...and she'd come back drunk, and she'd hold me in her arms and say that she was sorry and that everything was gonna change starting today. "Everything is gonna be different. I love you." And she'd hug me... ...and she'd be listening to music, and she'd be holding me there, rocking me, and-- and I just-- I believed her, and I was like, "Love you," and I'd hug her and everything, and she'd let me sleep with her on the bed one night. And then, the next morning, she woke up. She was like, "What the... are you doing here?" And she kicked me, she slapped me, and me she kicked me out, and she threw me out, and I was just so confused, and I was like, I just-- I thought-- and then she did that a ton of times. Um... But every time, I just believed her. I just believed her. I just believed her and... But it just never changed. Right here, Sydney. Get the edges a little bit better, right here. I grew up in Arkansas, a small country town. I'm the third of 18 children. I wanted to be like my mom, but I didn't want 18. I'll settle for five. Five years, I didn't get pregnant. I did everything the doctor told me to do, and I couldn't get pregnant. I thought, Lord, and I talked to my pastor. He said, "I want you and your husband to come to communion, and I'm gonna pray for you." Two weeks later, I was pregnant. God gave me a miracle baby. That's why I call my daughter, Ericka, my miracle baby. And then, after I couldn't have any more kids, my girlfriend, who worked for Department of Children's Services, she said, "You love kids. Why don't you become a foster parent?" Erika was seven when I got my first kid, which was Steven. What time is it? Seven forty-five. Okay, the bus should be here any minute. Casi has autism. Sweet little girl, beautiful little girl, has a lot of problem that she's not responsible for. -No, no. -Come on. Come on. Come on. No. No. No, no, no, no, no! -Oh, God. Come on. Come on, Casi. Come on. No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no! Casi. Casi, you gotta get on the bus. Okay, the bus gotta go. They're gonna go without you. -I'll go to the door. -Yes, yeah! -Okay, come on. -One step. Why are they yelling at me? One more step, Casi. Please? No. Do you think she'll be all right on the bus? Yesterday, she bit me again. God. Oh, my God. Hope she'll be okay. -She'd never act this-- You know what? Maybe I should just take her. -Come on, Casi. Come on, Casi. -Come on. -It's okay. I got you. Come on. You're okay. Once I get them in school, get everybody in school, and get them situated, then I can start my day. So, that's the purpose of the morning prayer. So I guess I need to have prayed a little bit harder for Casi. Majority of our children that we see live in poverty. They are minorities. They come from single-parent households. They come from families where there is undiagnosed mental illness. These are the larger society's problems that we haven't addressed. A majority of our cases are general neglect. The children aren't being properly cared for or provided for. We just don't get to choose what families we're born into. I was actually born into a pretty normal family. My parents were married. I have five siblings, the usual cat, dog, and bike. Then when I was eight years old, my mother filed for divorce, and just like that, everything changed. In what seemed like a matter of days, my family became devastatingly poor. And somehow, in the mix of all the commotion, my mom went to the doctor and found out that she had breast cancer. I'm not sure what happened, but after a few treatments of chemotherapy, she was a different person. She would beat us and talk to us viciously for little to no reason. I remember being dragged across the floor by my hair, naked, while being punched and kicked all over my body, constantly being slapped in the face, and called nasty whores and bitches, and told to kill myself. I'm sorry. I've never told this part of my story. My mom ended up getting section eight housing, but the tragic thing is that when we actually did get section eight, we moved into the hood, all hell really broke loose. My sixth grade experience in my new school was terrifying. By the end of the first month in our new school, both me and my big sister, Charity, joined a clique, which is a mini gang. I really liked being in a gang, because it gave me a sense of normality, but mostly because I was afraid of my mom, and after she would hit me or degrade me, I could go hit someone else and feel better, because after I discovered that hitting people relieved some of the pain that I was feeling inside, I stopped crying when my mom would hit me. I didn't want her to use me to feel better. The first time I ran away from home-- -Oops! That's my sister, Charity. I'm gonna tell her, "Girl, don't be callin' while I'm here." -She can feel it. She can feel I'm telling the family business. She always knows. She's like, "Stop tellin' our business!" She always knows that I'm doin' it. But... So, actually, the first time that I ran away from home, I remember my mother was beating me in the kitchen, and I heard my big sister, Charity, I believe, scream out, "Run." So, I ran to my best friend's house, and after one look at me, her mom hid me from my mom for about three days. During those three days that I was there, I had mastered shoplifting to a tee. One morning, after a successful shoplifting spree, I was caught by the grocery store security with two cartons eggs and two packs of bacon stuffed under each of my arms in my jacket. They called my mom for over 12 hours before the executive decision was made to call the police. I was taken to juvenile hall, and that's where my foster care journey began. All right, let's meet over here. So, how are you feeling about your court appearance today? All right. It's all good. Yeah? You feel like you're doing well? Yeah, just-- I just don't like court. It just-- What don't you like about court? It's just the pressure. -Yeah, stressful. -Constant pressure, yeah. Okay. I have questions about especially last year. It sounded like a hard year. Would you say? -A stressful year. -Stressful year? I was never on probation before last year. -Yup, yeah. -Everything changed, really. Yeah, and it sounded like, even the year before, a lot of changes happened, right? -Mm-hmm. -Like, you were in... four different group homes? Yeah, I was in a lotta group homes. So, I wanna talk a little bit about that. When you arrive in court here, and they don't know you, and all they receive is something like the police report, they see one act, and it's typically, you know, in their eyes, a bad act, right? And so, part of what my job is to do is, um, tell the fuller story of Dasani. And so, my way of working with you is to figure out what parts of your story you actually want to share, but I don't wanna do it without your collaboration, okay? Shall we go to court? Uh-uh. -What'd you say? -Uh-uh, not back in there. -Uh-uh. -Bad place. All right. Do you remember how long you were in there? Approximately 25 days. -Twenty-- 25? -It was the worst 25 days of my life. I think, if you keep doing well, you won't end up back there. Let's bring in Dasani. We need to get the APD to substitute. -No, I don't. -No? Hello, Dasani. -How you doin', mister? -I'm well. Thank you. So, Dasani, overall, I got a great report. Your grades are really good. I see an A in Algebra, a B in Life Skills, a B in History, and A in Lab. And how'd the C slip in there? C in English? -How does that slip in there? -Oh, I don't know. I mean... Come on. Let's work on that. Let's make sure if you need tutoring, let's get tutoring in place. So, you're gonna be at school on time. -Mm-hmm. -Getting your work done. Getting your homework done, right? -Yes, sir. -You-- You're keeping your word. So, the only place you haven't is I got a negative test. I mean a positive test, excuse me. 138 nanograms, which means you took a couple hits. Yes? -Yes, sir. -Your Honor, um, he's struggling with sobriety, and relapse can be part-- is sometimes part of recovery. It is, often. So, what happened? My-- I don't-- One of my friends gave me a brownie. I was unaware. Hey, come on. But I take full responsibility. Yeah, yeah. -You were-- You knew. -I didn't-- I really didn't-- You're sophisticated enough to know. Please don't play me. Yeah, I didn't-- I didn't know, but I take full responsibility. I wasn't born yesterday. You know. When you took the first bite, you knew. And now, the other question is, you called him a friend. Now, this friend may be using, but the friend should respect your decision not to use and should be supporting that. You may wanna assess who you have as friends. -Who your friends are. -Your Honor, by way of clarification, this is another young person who lives at the group home. So he is a friend, but he also is living at the same place as Dasani. Maybe we need to recategorize that as an acquaintance. Your Honor, I also just wanted to flag that the team, the defense team and probation, will be working together to identify more individualized counseling to address some of the underlying needs that, uh, may be manifesting itself in substance use. Um, as the court knows, um, Dasani has quite a, um, traumatic childhood history, and some of that seems to be unaddressed. So we would like to explore, -for instance... -Maybe I'm a Neanderthal. -...trauma informed therapy. -I'm not into it. I need you to take care of business. Perform, which is what you're doing. -Don't make excuses, right? -Yes, sir. All right, that's all I'm asking for. -Thank you, Dasani. -Thank you, Your Honor. -Good work. -Thank you, Your Honor. Thanks, everyone. All right, next case. Deputy Garcia, ready to rock and roll? Watch your fingers. All right, good afternoon. Let me hear from children's counsel, parents' counsel, and then I'll last hear from the county with respect to detention issues. Your Honor, on behalf of Kris'Lyn, we are asking for her to be returned to her father today. Even with the department's low burden, they haven't established by prima facie evidence that there's risk if Kris'Lyn were released today. The department will now be testing the mother, can do unannounced visits to make sure that father isn't allowing unauthorized contact, and that she's not visiting or caring for the baby if under the influence. On behalf of father, Your Honor, father is asking for the child to be, uh, placed with him today. Father did not know about mother's drug use, and mother misinformed the department. Um... Misinformed is not exactly the right word, but, uh-- Did not tell the department of her drug use and did not tell father of-- of her drug use, as well. But father is in a position now to care for the minor and he's asking for the minor to be returned to him today. All right. Mom's counsel? I think my client made mistakes on so many levels, and the court pointed out something that I felt was important: that my client lied to the department in not disclosing the correct circumstances that led her to use drugs and the full story, but when DCFS is involved, parents are afraid to lose their child, so the stories that come out may not really reflect what transpired. She's certainly not the first parent that's not telling the truth to the department. Exactly. So I don't think father should be judged on misrepresentations made by my client, and-- What are you asking for? I'm asking for release to the father. My client would not in any way conduct herself in a way to sabotage a release to the father. So, my client would continue with the program that she is in, which is Tarzana Treatment Center. She will continue testing. She is amenable to supervised visits. Uh, she will be grateful if father could be the monitor. So we are joining father's attorney and minor's attorney in making that request. I'm not happy about the misrepresentations. We'll be charitable at that. And those even could potentially be tied to the father. But the father works. He's got strong family support. I do think, under the circumstances, it is appropriate to detain from the mother, and I think that it's appropriate to release to the father with conditions. The release, I think, should be conditioned on the father staying with the grandfather so that there's some level of supervision. So, let's discuss visitation. It should be monitored. Uh, mom can't breastfeed till she's testing clean. Dad, although the child is released to you, she remains under the supervision of the court. You're also not to move addresses without notifying the social worker. And, also, let's make sure we have a holiday visitation schedule so that the mother can see the child on Christmas Eve and Christmas. -All right, thank you. -Thank you, Your Honor. You remember our conversation about the origin of this problem? -Right. -You have to deal with that... -I know. -...squarely. -Okay. -Okay? -Thank you. -Take care, okay? Okay. And nice working with you. Okay, thanks, guys. This is your attorney's direct dial extension. -Okay. This is a release slip, shows that you have custody. Um, they're gonna call the social worker and let the social worker know your daughter was released to you. You can call her and arrange to pick up your daughter, okay? Everything is okay, baby. See? I told you. -All right? -Okay. Right? We got the best news ever, right? -Yeah. -Okay, then. Everything just seemed to have hit us at one time. We lost our car, place, and me being pregnant, being homeless, I hit rock bottom. It was like, dang, take everything away from us to give us this blessing that we've been wanting for years. I made some bad decisions, and I allowed that situation to take over me. I used cocaine the day before my water broke. I just told her, "We in this together." I'm here for you just like you've been here for me, but just don't-- don't make another mistake like this again. -Butterfly. -She's fussy, fussy. I have a bottle in the bag, so you can make her a meal. Okay, thank you. Hey, beautiful. There goes daddy baby. So, this is-- How are you with handling? Oh, I'm good. -It's okay. It's okay, beautiful. So, do you have a bed? -Bassinet. -It's in there now? -No, it's, um-- Mm-hmm. -So, it's all coming? Do you know around what time she'll be here? She's-- I don't know. About an hour. -What's wrong? Huh? -Hi. -Oh, hi. How are ya? I'm Redina Sheriff, the social worker. Okay, social worker. -Nice to meet you. -Okay, how you doing? I'm gonna give you my card. So, the baby is gonna be where? Uh, I'm gonna have to set her bassinet up in here. -Okay. -Yeah. I'll probably just sleep on the couch now. You're home now. I'm so happy I got you back. Ready? A one. Look at Jake. -Surprise! -Hey, Jake. Hey, Mama. Have a nice weekend! We've been waiting on you. Yeah, for a very long time. -Are your friends on the bus? -Yeah. Jake was three years old when I got Jake, and he had cerebral palsy. He had a lotta things wrong with him, but he loved people. I remember he couldn't do anything for himself. I had to bathe him. I had to brush his teeth. I taught him how to walk. I taught him how to use a knife and a fork and not to use his fingers and eat. And then the social worker came to me and said, "You have worked miracles with this child. He can be adopted now. We wanna take him and put him in an adopted home to get him ready for adoption." I said, "Are you crazy or what? You're not taking my baby. I have worked with him for years to get him to where he is now. Why would I let you take him? You're not taking him. If anybody adopt him, I will be the one to adopt him, but you guys can't take him from me 'cause I'm all he knows." I was in seven other foster homes before this one. The difference is, in between this home and the other homes, is I used to run away, and now I don't run away. I would always throw stuff around at people and, like, just tore down things, and so I just don't do it here anymore. Once a kid is taken from their parent, if they didn't have an issue before, they got one now, and that's what I try to tell some of the social workers. I said, "Once you took that kid away, they're gonna become bitter. They're gonna become destructive. They're gonna become angry. They're gonna have a lotta problem wrong with them because you took them from their comfort zone, from their parents, from their school, from their friends. You took them away, and you expect 'em to be okay with that. They're not." When I turned 18, I thought I was ready. I was excited. I was like, I'm gonna do my own thing now. The social workers would often say, "Oh, you know what? You're one of our most successful kids." I just feel like I have to meet up to their expectations. I have to do good. If I get a C in a class, that's not good enough. I feel like I have to do better. There you go. In the system, you hear a lot about kids who go into homes where, you know, they're sexually abused, even physically, verbally, any kind of abuse, um, you can think of. Um... These parents, foster parents, however you want to call them, um, sometimes the parents don't know what the child has been through, or they do, and, you know, they'll send the kids to therapy, take medications, the, um, um... And just-- or the kid is too much for them to handle, so then they-- they send them off. So, it's like-- it's-- it's delicate. It's... Um, okay... College was nothing like I expected. It's a lot harder than I thought it would be. I think having been born a drug baby has definitely affected the way I learn. It's hard for me to process things. It's hard for me to focus. It makes me feel dumb. I want to be able to handle it. I want to be able to get my stuff in order, but... I'm not ready. -Where were you born? -Chicago. And how long did you live in Chicago? I was there for, like, five, six years. Okay. What do you remember about Chicago as a kid? Not much. Yeah, I was a little kid. I mean, I remember streets. Okay. My mom used to walk me to school when I was little, as a toddler. I remember that street. What were the streets like? That's... You're telling me something with that look, -but I-- I can't translate it! -As-- As in-- As in-- What you-- What-- What kinda-- What are you asking about the street? Like, do you have good memories of the streets, or do you have bad memories of the streets? Both good and bad. Okay, give me an example of the good. -I liked the weather. -Okay. And that's not really a lot about... Not a lot about the streets that were good? -It-- It-- -Okay. It's-- It's not so much as that as... Ooh. I'm getting memories. What's coming to your mind? My little brother. Oh. -Can we stop, please? -Mm-hmm. I'm gettin' that-- that-- that good glory sweat, dude. Right. Dasani did witness his mother being murdered. -Mm-hmm. -By a father figure. It's unclear whether that was mom's boyfriend or whether it was the biological father. When he tells the story, he says that his dad killed his mom. -Right. -Okay. And then, at that point, the father that he knew gets incarcerated. Mom is now deceased, and he gets placed with a 60-year-old family friend. And gives him up in 2014. Yes. Then he ends up in a number of group homes. -Then he's bouncing around... -Right. Right. ...from group home to group home. What I hadn't delved into as deeply is the ten years he was with his adopted parent. -Mm-hmm. -She physically abused him. He said that the foster mother burned him, and he's got a burn mark, with an iron. She denied it. And when she decided to call DCFS and say, "I don't want him anymore"-- She said, "And I think, at this point, I just need to let him go." -Mm-hmm. -That "he's a big boy now." -Mm-hmm. -He was like 13, 14. No, they couldn't pick him up quick enough. So she took all of his clothes, put them in trash bags, and dumped him off at DCFS. Well, I wish I had gotten on the case earlier, but I'm really grateful that we have collaboration here because I think it's the case management, your relationship with Dasani, and all the handling of the social work, the placement that makes getting off probation quicker. -Mm-hmm. -Dasani is a foster youth. I mean, this is-- His delinquency is a product of that. They recognize that a lot of his actions are trauma. So, he really did, and these kids really do fall through the cracks. I think he fell through a major crack. Right. The tough thing about the system is that it is a system. Los Angeles County is a massive county. So it's like trying to treat everybody the same, but everyone is not the same. Everyone's unique. It's kinda maxed out. It's at capacity. So, a lot of these social workers, they aren't able to go the extra mile for every case. Foster youth, they're in trouble, they're on probation, and everyone has a judgement on the youth, and what they did, and what they should do, but nobody is with them day to day. I spent most of my teenage years in between lockdown group homes, juvenile hall, and staying with friends and boyfriends. As a probation youth, when you run away from placement, they put a warrant out for your arrest. I just kept on AWOLing, get locked up, AWOL, get locked up, AWOL. I don't know if I was really depressed or indifferent, but I just don't remember any light, like, ever, besides, like, the... I don't remember ever seeing, like, light. It's always been open like that. -It's always been open? -Mm-hmm. I was in eternal darkness. Do you remember when you first got here? You didn't wanna interact with the other kids. You didn't like the staff. You didn't wanna come out your room. You didn't like the food. You didn't like the shower. I think a lot of it is for safety reasons that they have the open-stalled restrooms and showers, but, you know, I'm a kid. I was embarrassed, I was humiliated, and I didn't want them to see inside of me or over me. And, you know, they used to laugh 'cause I used be the one, like, walking like this. To me, it was so degrading and so awful that... I don't know. It's just really hard to care about yourself when you're being punished at that level. I saw in Jessica a person that was crying out for help. She didn't realize she was screaming, "Help me," but I-- I felt it, and I saw it. I think she had been told many times that she was never gonna amount to anything. Nobody made her feel like she was worth anything. "You're never gonna be anything. Nobody cares." You know, but I saw something in her that-- that told me different, and if somebody can reach her, this could be one of the kids that we can save. So, Jessica, what really helped you achieve the success that you've had, and why do you believe those forces around you worked? The biggest thing, I think, was having people come into my life and hold hope for me. There was very long periods of time in my adolescence where I had given up, um, on believing that I could achieve anything. When I was 18, I went to a nonprofit organization, and I met people there who started talkin' to me for the first time about education, and at that time, I had very firm beliefs that I was a stupid person. I tested very low in community college. I tested into third grade math and eighth grade English, which was very discouraging, but they believed in me, and I really needed that because even after they discovered that I was pregnant, and I thought that they were gonna give up on me 'cause I wasn't gonna become a success story, they still pushed me. People have spoken life into me that-- and-- and I was dead. -Jessica Antonia Chandler. No crying, baby. This is happy. This is happy. Mom! Go Mom! Two of my former foster sisters, when they found me on Facebook and saw that I had got my master's degree, they decided to go to college. I guess I was just so terrible that they were like, "If Jessica got a diploma, if she graduated from college, anybody can. Like, this must be easy." And even thought it wasn't easy, it wasn't-- since they knew my story, and they knew how much I had struggled and how bad my behaviors had been at one time, they knew that transformation was possible for them, too. -Hi. -Hi, Miss Redina. -How are you? -Good. How are you? Good, good. Do you wanna go into the room? Yes, please. Here's baby. -Oh! Here's mommy. Here's my mommy. -Hi, babe. -Hi, beautiful. Here's your mama. And Merry Christmas. This for her. Thank you. Thank you. So you can get more little baby items. Here's your mommy, baby. I was gonna go right to Walmart, too, after. -Oh, okay, that's good. -Thank you. I appreciate it. Your mommy missed you. Aww. Miss Sheriff got you a present. -What's the matter? -You're probably wondering about -the whole monitoring... -...who can monitor. -Yeah. And then how, for father, I'm gonna provide family reunification services. Um... What does that mean? They come once a week, and they'll address any of your issues, and they have quarterly meetings, and you would go to the meeting, and we'll discuss what we've accomplished, -what we still need to do... -What needs-- ...and so forth. -To get us back together? -Right. That's our number one thing: to reunify families because, really and truly, we don't wanna see you back in the department. And I don't want to come back. -And so, in order-- -I wanna come back and show you how good we're doin'. -Right. -Right. And how much progress we're making. See the progress that you're doin'. Right, right, right. And that's understandable. I miss both of them, 'cause it's not just her that's taken from me. It's him, too, right now. So it's hard. -How long is our visit? -And-- I can allow for two hours. -Is that fine? -Yeah. I'm gonna give you guys a little time, okay? Okay, thank you. Thank you, Miss Redina. Yeah, I'll be back to check on you. Thank you. -I miss you. -I miss you, too, baby. How has she been through the night? I got an alarm for every three hours... ...but it's-- it been all right. She eats every three hours? Yeah. -She's eatin' a lot? -Yeah. Look at all that hair. I didn't grow up with social services involved in my life. I did grow up in a domestic violence household. I was always the one to go take the kids, and go in the room, and close the door, and shelter them, and tell them not to listen, and... The only thing that I got out of that was to not tolerate any man to hit me. That was one of my main things growing up, when I'd seen them go through that, that this is what I don't want, and so when I, you know, when I got with Chris, he gave me that. My mom had me when she was 15. She's a single parent. I seen stuff a three-year-old, four-year-old shouldn't have never seen. My mom and my dad was arguin', and my mom was saying, "Don't leave. Don't leave." My dad went to the front door, and he put a dollar in my hand, and then he left. Then I looked back in the kitchen, and then I see my mom, um... trying to kill herself. Um, and, uh... that right there, that scarred me for life. Growing up, I-- I couldn't be like my dad. I couldn't be like him. My mom always struggled. She struggled after my father left us. She did her best, but, you know, she-- she just couldn't do it. She's going crazy 'cause she don't know how she's gonna pay the rent, so... started hustlin' on the streets. Been hustlin' since I was 11, stealing cars, selling them to chop shops, and helping my mom pay rent. My number-one rule was, I asked my mom not to-- never ask me where I got the money from. Just pay the bills. My mom always drilled in my head she wanted me to stop, but it was just I was-- I was-- I was addicted to money. It was something that I-- I didn't grow up having, so it was, "I want that instead of studying in school," until I went to jail, and I realized, uh, you know, I was-- I felt that I was being selfish. I wasn't caring about my mom. I wasn't caring that I'm the oldest son, and I have three little sisters. So, that-- that made me want to change my ways. I see myself sort of in my mom's shoes. Me struggling to try to take care of my family like a-- like a man should take care of his family. This is where Zoila lives, and I lived here for seven years. Mary! -Hi, guys. -Hi. I don't wanna start hugging you. How are you? How are you? Hi, Babba. Mary was a... little skinny little girl. She came when she was seven. She got along with my kids and with my other foster kids. We just loved her to pieces. -The social worker said that she had been in 12 houses prior to mine, and, to me, it was like, I'm gonna make this the final home for her. I wanted her to stay here, and I wanted to see her get married and move on, but it didn't work that way. -You didn't go to school today? -Shame on you. You've gotta be motivated to go to school. That's the only way that you'll be able to finish your classes. I know. -So, you started off good. -I know. Even though she lived with me for so many years, some of my rules here at the house were rules that she didn't wanna accept, and so she wanted to try it out, um, elsewhere, to see if maybe they didn't have any rules as strict as I was. Oh, she was okay. She's... you know, we don't have no problem with her. But I was always in trouble, remember? Yeah, but, um, I-- I-- I cannot say nothing. She's in trouble because she wants to do it. Like I always told her, I see her as my daughter, and I want the best. So, when I see her doing something that wasn't right, I would always call it to her attention, and I think that's where our relationship was breaking up. It was very difficult. I cried, and she cried, and, you know, but I think that, at that time, it was the best thing for both of us. I didn't really think I was gonna do it. I was just being a teenager rebel. I just wanted to leave. But then when I was actually in the new home, and I arrived, and I had my luggage, then I was in, like, a little room, I just looked around, and I was like, "What the heck just happened?" And I just started crying, and then I called my mom right away, and I was like, "I miss you. I wanna go back." It was really hard. It took me a while to get used to the fact that I wasn't here anymore, but they never said anything to stop me. They never said, "No, stay. We want you here." They just said, "Fine. If you wanna leave, leave." I've always kinda just wondered what was wrong with me. Why did all these families just give up on me? Why didn't any other-- any of my other family members take me in instead of just watching me get passed around? Definitely, one of the biggest reasons why I'm trying so hard not to give up and to keep pushing forward is to show my mom. Look who you called a mistake. Look who you tried killing several times. Like, look. Look at who I-- who I can be. Look at where I'm going. And I just kinda wanna show her, like, I wasn't a mistake. Being in a group home is like lockdown. It's like having a big ol' chain attached to your leg. You go, and if it don't work out, you go somewhere completely different. It's like you're just bouncing from place, to place, to place, to place, to place. You don't know none of these people. These people is brand new. This is a whole new experience. This is a whole new way. You feel me? It's a whole new environment. Everything is different. You give a man feet, he gonna walk. You give a man a scooter, he gonna scoot. You give a man a skateboard, he gonna skate. Give me a bike, I'ma ride that damn bike. You feel me? It's just... Damn. It's a getaway. All right, I got, um, Dasani. He's here for a JDRV, which is a six-month progress report. It covers the services that we-- that we provided for him. My concern is what's happening on page two. -Yes. -My concern was behavior issue, suspended. Um, then he started blaming the house manager and threw a pitcher of juice at him. Not working at, um, therapy. Not working at substance abuse because they think he is, um, supplying marijuana there, which seriously annoys me. They're allegations that other young people were saying that he was selling. Those are unsubstantiated. We did not take the time to investigate that further because he was all-- If the other kids are saying it, the likelihood is, it's true. Your Honor, there-- no one found any weed on him -or any drugs. -And not a surprise either. -No one saw him. -Importantly-- You're saying that they're picking on him? They're focusing on him? I'm saying that it's com-- it's not evidence. It's not-- there's-- I mean, you can assume it's true, -but it's-- you can assume-- -I am. -Well, that's not fair. -Importantly, he is enrolled in a program currently. It is school based. It is weekly. He is attending, and it seems to be-- How often is he tested? Do you know? I don't believe he's tested positive since-- Do we know how often he's tested? -He has a negative. -Yeah, he tested earlier this month, and he tested negative. So, I've still got these other issues going on. Um, they're working with him in counseling. If I just read between the lines here, he's just not engaged in the counseling. Dasani goes to counseling. He's not refusing to go. He is not emotionally able to talk about what he witnessed when he was four years old. Um, I know that last time we were here, Miss Soung had talked about getting him involved in trauma informed therapy, and he was terrified of that. He is now receiving his therapy at Didi Hirsch. In the spirit of the way we discuss things to see how they're doing, why don't we give him a chance at Didi Hirsch? All right. Um, so I guess I'll yell a bit... and bluster, and he'll walk out the door unless he annoys me too much, but he'll walk out the door. Anything else I-- anyone thinks I should do? All right. Anything else? -No. -No? All right. All right. So, I got a report, and I want you to know that when I first read this, I was lookin' to detain you for the weekend. I was not happy with what I'm reading here about-- Now, they say you threw a pitcher of juice. Was it a pitcher or just the water or juice? I-- I threw everything, but the only thing that really projected was the-- the juice. You got lucky, you mean. You missed. It's unacceptable. Something like that happens, I'm detaining you. With regard to drug counseling, they kicked you out of the drug counseling program 'cause they think you're selling. I've been clean, sir. I appreciate that, but there's a lotta smoke. I'm not gonna be happy if I find out that you're selling poison or giving poison away to any other kids. -Yes, sir. -Don't. And then I also am reading, um, that you were a little reluctant with your counseling. You go to the counseling, but I'm hearing that you're not fully engaged. -To which one, sir? -Well, your-- your counseling. -At the group home. -The group home? -Yes. -I went every day -and participated. -I know. You're going. And participated actively. You think you're participating fully? Okay. All right. So, I'm-- I'm gonna ask you just to pause and to think about how you could, uh, you could participate more, how you could be engaged more to deal with the trauma-- and I-- I don't mean to be using that word-- but that you experienced in your past to work through this. I know that it's reluctance to talk about it. We guys don't like talking about this stuff either, but I need you to truly try. -Yes? -Yes, sir. So, I understand he's working with your arts program. He's very engaged. He's a good leader in the program. Um, he does our music program twice a week. He's very involved with that. Like I said, he often spends lunches there as well. Uh, and I think it's a good outlet for him. He does express himself in there. Good. I like it. And-- Yeah, he's been a very good addition. The thing that I-- that I take from all that is intelligence, and I've seen that. We all see it. Let's not waste it. Nothing worse in this world than wasted potential. All right, Dasani, uh, um, came-- started with being pretty upset with you. I've come around a bit here, but know I'll be watching closely. Have a good day. The Los Angeles population is ten percent African American. The foster care system is 25 percent African American. That's-- it's extremely disproportionate. The foster care system is a punitive system. Punishment is just more hurt. Like, there is that-- the saying that hurt people hurt people. People who are hurting hurt people. Well, punishment is just more hurt. Everyone open your little bags. Hold it. Hold it like this. Don't spill it, please. -Ice cream. -I don't really need it. I scream. We all scream for ice cream. Hold it. Be careful. Denyshia was-- she came to me with an attitude. She came to me with a lot of baggage and a lot of problems, and the social worker told me I was gonna have some problem with Denyshia. From day one, she said, "My father said I had the devil in me, and he's not comin' out." She had got in her room, under her bed, and she said, "I'm not coming out. The devil told me not to come out." I said, "Denyshia, you don't have no devil in you." "Yes, I do. My dad said I have the devil in you." I said, "You know what? If he's in you, tonight he's coming out, 'cause the devil can't stay in my house." So, she came from under the bed, and she said, "How you gonna do it?" I said, "I'm gonna get-- watch me." I said, "One of you kids, go open the front door. Go get me the broom. Open the front door." I said, "Devil, you gotta come outta here. This kid-- come outta her heart, right now, and you get outta my house." So, I got the broom, and I swept him out, and I told her, I said, "Now he's gone. He's outta your heart, and he's outta my house." And she said, "Mom, you"-- I said, "He's gone. He's gone. Do you feel him in your heart?" "No." I said, "He's gone. Don't ever let him come back again." And she believed that story. That's an old wives' story... ...but I believed it, too. My hands are turning red. Okay, what will happen if the ice melt, and it's still not done? You put more ice in it? Well, then that means y'all did something wrong. Y'all are not shaking good enough. If they like milkshake, I mean, why can't you guys do that? You guys can do whatever you want. I'm gonna make ice cream. Even if I have go to China to get ice, I will do it. The kids need a lot of love, and the type of love, it has to be long suffering. It have to be beyond measure. You know, you just can't just say, "I love you." Prove it. Do something about it. Show them. There, it's coming out. It's not coming out. It would've been done already. I'm gonna go in the house. Okay, let's wait until she come back. Set that-- put that down, Jake. Let them do it. When she come back out here, just tell her, "Okay, Denyshia, you done a good job. We've been waiting on you." Blah, blah, blah. Give her some encouragement, okay? Sydney? -Yes? -Can you do that? -Yes. -Okay, when she come back out, -just pump her up. -That's fine with me. Okay. But don't overdo it, okay? -Teamwork. -Teamwork, okay. You're doing an amazing job, and something else. Okay, you think of that. Teamwork make perfect. Teamwork-- Teamwork make perfect. That's right. Okay, let me go get her outta there. Everybody think of something, but don't overdo it. Okay, something to say. No, she's too irritated. I got a new idea. -Okay. -Yippee. I'm gonna pour this ice water over you. Go ahead. Go ahead. I don't care. I love this family. It's like the only family I have. It's like... I really love them. Like, I don't know what I'd be without them. -Yes? -Hi, I'm Christina. I'm the person you've been talking to. -Mm-hmm. -This is my supervisor, Robin Kovalsky. So she's just here with us. Okay. Oh, look at how cute she is. She's adorable. -Thank you. -Is she eating? Yeah. -Aww, great. How old is she now? -She is a month and nine days. -Oh, okay. -She's doing really good though. -Yeah, she is. -I don't see any concerns. -Uh-uh. Let's go get your bassinet. Does she like going out on walks in her stroller? Yeah. When I walk to the store, by the time... by the time I get to the front gate, -she's already asleep. Yeah, that's-- I know. -That's-- it's so soothing. -She's already asleep. It's wonderful. Yeah, it's great. Yeah, it is. Yeah. I know she's little, but what kind of baby would you describe her as? -A happy baby. -A happy baby. A happy baby. You don't want nothing right now? She's kinda frozen, huh? Yeah, she is. Hey. Hey, sweetness. -She's kind of frozen. -She's kind of frozen. -Hey, baby girl. -Oh, she's daydreaming. -Hey. -Does she do that often? She daydreams constantly. -I don't know. -Hmm. When you take her back for her shots, tell the doctor about that. Yeah, her daydreaming? -Yeah. -Yeah, um, 'cause she, like, she was really kind of frozen. That might be a little concerning. Yeah. Um, sometimes it could be nothing, but sometimes it could be a sign of something -going on in the brain. -Okay. So we wanna make sure the doctor is aware of that. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause she didn't even blink... No, she didn't blink at all. ...for a good amount of time. -Yeah, yeah. -Okay. And she had no movement. It was like she was completely... Yes. Yeah, let's make sure she-- you get that followed up on. When's the doctor's appointment? The sixth. Do you know what? Maybe you should call and see if you can get her in before that. Okay. And let them just check her out. Okay. I mean, everything else looks great, but that was a little bit of a concern. Uh, let me hold her again, and... I'm-- I'm-- uh, so, her head control is good. Uh, don't worry. I won't drop her. I'm just checking how she controls -not just her arms and legs... ...but her trunk and head. You know, what people are concerned about, sounds like, is, you know, did your daughter have a little seizure? Your brain is obviously composed of a bunch of neurons, brain cells, and they all have, uh, electronic properties, like telephone wires. A seizure is uncontrolled electrical activity. You know, she's had one episode, which is a little concerning. We-- I'd like to do a test. Uh, I have to order it. It's called an electroencephalogram. We put about ten pairs of wires on-- on her scalp, and we try to see if her brain has any abnormal electrical signal, which could be a sign that she's at risk for seizures. -Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Mama's sorry. I know. It's been about ten years since I'm at Nurse-Family Partnership. I talk about you guys all the time. I met Doljai, my nurse, when I was about four or five months pregnant with my first son, Noah. After I decided to keep Noah, I had a lotta ideas and dreams of how I would disrupt the cycles of violence and poverty in my life, and prevent Noah from experiencing my fate. These ideas included unconditional love, never throwing him away, and providing him with all the material things I longed for as a child. Doljai. -Aww. I-- Doljai Chaikumnerd-- I would never remember a name like that. I'm from South Central L.A. We don't have names like that in South Central L.A. I had-- I had no idea that it would take so much more than love and good intentions. Don't be surprising me. When I first met my nurse, Doljai, I didn't think she was gonna work out. One of her first comments was that I shouldn't be drinking two-liter sodas and eating Top Ramen noodles every day. But, after she told me about the lack of nutrition in my diet and how my feet were gonna swell up like sausages, I threw it all away. Doljai was like a human "What to Expect When You're Expecting" app on steroids. The only other voices in my life were my child's father's parents. "Don't hold that baby, or you're gonna spoil him. Don't do this, or you're gonna do that." I was able to say, "Well, my nurse, she has a degree, and she said this, and here is a handout if you need to read it." -So-- So it was very empowering for me. Today, Noah is nine, and his brother, Jonah, is seven. They play basketball and football and get good grades. Noah is a self-proclaimed vegetarian, and Jonah eats everything in sight. They have never known what it's like to be abused or neglected or had to wonder if they are loved, and they never will. I have been very privileged to have had many people positively impact my life. However, my experience working with youth and families as they overcome tremendous obstacles to success has taught me that sometimes it just takes one. I needed you. I also know that, at 18, I didn't love myself, and I didn't care about myself, so I needed someone to care what happened to my child as I was becoming who I am now. So, I just wanted to thank you guys so much for all you do, and, hopefully, inspire you guys so just one of 'em -out of your 50,000... ...hopefully, one of them makes you very proud. You did a good job. You tricked me into doing this. Order 44C is now in session. The honorable Margaret S. Henry, Judge, presiding. Hey, guys. Okay? Good morning. Hello. My stomach hurts. All right. Counsel, state your appearances, please. Jennifer Lorson, CLCLA 4 on behalf of the youth. She goes by Mary, Your Honor. Mary is present and seated at counsel table. Mary, what can we do for you today? Let's see. One of the things that didn't happen is, she did not get immediately linked to the Resilient Scholars over at Cal State University Northridge to try to get her-- Oh, well, then that's true. I also heard that she's thinking about not wanting to continue in school. No. What? Stop. Oh, my gosh. Oh, you're thinking about dropping out. Oh. No, no, not-- Um... Just out of that school. I want to go to an all-performing-arts academy. What's your career goal? I want to be an actress. That's a tough one. You know, it's very difficult. I know. Um, yeah, and a lot of competition. You graduated from high school. That's a big deal, but I think even as-- as an actress, if you could study acting, um, in college, it'll help you with everything in life. -Okay. -You know, if you-- if you get some more education. So, this semester was definitely really, really hard for me, and, uh... I saw a therapist, and, you know, they told me, "It'd be best to take a medical leave for you, right now." It doesn't mean I'm not going back. It doesn't mean I'm, like, you know, completely through with it. It just means, right now, I am not ready. I'm not really interested in people that want to be famous. -Mm-hmm. -I'm interested in people that really want to be artists, because so few people become famous, and I don't think it's really all it's cracked up to be anyway. What calls you to acting? In theater, when I was on stage, when I'd perform, I'd forget about everything. It made me happy. It felt nice to pretend to be somebody else for a moment. I just also get to imagine another life for me when I have a-- a-- a certain character. I can, you know, build up her background story and pretend that it's mine, and, you know, depending on the character, most of the time, I give myself a happy childhood memory and, like, family and stuff, and it's-- it's nice to... I guess, kind of imagine that. Come in and get a chair. Closer in the circle, please. The floor is cool. All right, our topic tonight is what? Family. Man, the shit starts at home. If stuff is not good at home, it's really difficult. We got a beautiful family in the room right now. Um, I don't know where I'd be without it. So, um, Dasani, are you ready, or you want a little more time? Uh, I'm ready, right now. How y'all doin' tonight? I'm doin' real good. This is a sensitive top-- topic tonight, so it's-- Man, never mind. Just let me get to it. Let me get down to it. Let me get down to it. Ah. There's only one thing I want you to work on. -Yes, ma'am. -You and I share something else, and you do it every time you get up, something I do, too. What is it? Goofy? You always smile. It's easier, right? It's a good-- It's just a natural feeling when you're around what you wanna be around, 'cause you don't get to be around what you really wanna be around a lot, and I feel that here. I really feel that. This is the only place. So, I appreciate y'all. That's awesome. So, um, take a deep breath and give us your piece. ♪ Look Some live in the gutter ♪ ♪ Some were born With silver spoons ♪ ♪ Born in the world-- ♪ Can we turn that down? -Goddamn! -Yeah, we gotta -turn it down and start again. Hold on. It's okay. Let's start it all over again. -Good Lord. -We're good. All right, let me get it all the way back, one more time, please.

I wanna try to do it with the music, man, because it really slap with the music. -I'm telling you all. -I know. I was in my room, really in there goin', -for, like, two hours. -I already know. Honestly, like, without the music, I can hear exactly what you're sayin'. You know what I mean? Like, it ain't hidin' be-- What you got to say is not hiding behind the beat, right now, and what you got to say is so important. That was the most vulnerable and authentic piece of you that you shared with us, and I don't know if you're aware, but when you show up that way, it gives everyone else your permission to do the same. Right, exactly. Because not everyone here may have experienced the system, but I can count maybe at least four or five of us who've experienced abandonment, who have experienced loss, including myself. And even thinking about my own piece today and how I wanted to deliver it, I now feel the sense of you within it. So thank you. Thank you for showing up. Appreciate that, really do, all y'all, for real. He told me that he felt like these last couple of years has been a waste of his life. -You know, he's just-- -Right. Time is just passing until you get into adulthood. He's so insightful. So, he really wants that connection, like, that family. And, like, how can you not want that for him when that's what wants? I mean, you know, we- we all got that phone call, ten o'clock at night, when he was, you know, really upset and-- and about to AWOL, and, you know, Lanny and you talked him down, -calmed him down, and he stayed. -Mm-hmm. I don't know. With all this, I mean, you know, with all the effort around it, I still fear that one day not bein'-- not bein' able to answer the phone, you know? -Right. Yeah. -And him-- And-- And-- my fear is, also, is, even if you hadn't answered the phone, and he'd taken off, I mean, knowing Dasani, he could come back later that night or the next day, and the consequences for that... Yeah. ...are so much more severe, again, than a non-foster youth, or a non-probation youth. If he'd been at home with two brothers... -Oh, yeah. -...and they'd got in a fight, -and somebody, you know... Right. ...got angry and threw a book, -and it broke the window... -Right. You know, the three brothers would have been grounded. Right. And our kid gets thrown in jail and charged with felony. With a felony. And I see this over and over and over, and it's just so unfair. Can we talk about your appointment? Your neurologist appointment? How that went? Uh... I was hurt for the simple fact just that now my daughter might have to deal with something that I feel she shouldn't have to deal with for the simple fact of what her mother done did. But, um... um, I already knew it was a possibility, but it's just the simple fact of just knowin' that she can have a seizure, or just knowin' that type of stuff. You know, I already have a lot on my-- on my plate, you know, with just trying to juggle working and being a parent. You know, it's-- -Overwhelming. -Yeah, it's very overwhelming. Now I see what single mothers go through. And it's hard. It is-- it is very hard, 'cause I'm not the type that wanna be sitting on the county, collectin' money. I'm not the type of person that wanna be sittin' on my butt 'cause I know that's not what a man is supposed to be doing. And, right now, I feel like that's what's gonna be having to happen for a while. With the neurologist, I was... Excuse my language, I was pissed off for the simple fact just that Raeanne done did something, and it's-- and it's gonna-- it's gonna reflect on my daughter. Why the hell did you choose to do this fucking drug? Can I share something, Chris? Just hearing you talk now, the benefits of having someone that you can talk to and express some of those feelings and get that off your chest because, yes, mom made a mistake. Mom, I think, is going through her own processes, as well as you are. You guys have to come to a-- a point where you have to forgive her. -She has to forgive herself. -And I-- and I-- I do. -I do forgive her... -Yeah. ...and I'm still gonna be here for her. It's just that-- that it was just like, wow, I had to leave out the room for a second and go walk 'cause it-- it put tears in my eyes just 'cause my daughter is gonna have to deal with that, but... And I think that counseling piece, and not to cut you off, but that counseling piece can assist you. I know sometimes-- You're trying to get me counseling. -I know. I'm gonna-- -I'm workin' it in. -Trying to get me counseling. And I'm not-- And it's not, like-- I think sometimes being-- even just being an, um, African American young man, you're like, "I don't need no one to talk to. Like, I'm a man. I can take care of this myself." But you may need somebody just to spend 30 minutes with to say, "You know what? I'm frustrated. I'm tired. Like, I need some help." So you don't have to keep it all in. Can I just say that I have been doing this for a long time... ...and I am really proud of this young man right here. -Oh, yeah. -Twenty-four years old... -Yeah. -...takin' the responsibility -at the levels that he is. -Yeah. It makes me proud. Thank you, and I really do appreciate that. I really do. Parent Partners, we are parents who have had open cases in the past, and now we work in collaboration with the department mainly to support you through the whole entire time. Okay. Okay, good. So, in my case, it took me ten months to get my kids back, but it was in program that I learned that once you're an addict, you're always an addict. Mm-hmm. I'm gonna admit my faults, and I'm gonna admit that I had a problem 'cause if I didn't have a problem, I wouldn't have used while I was pregnant. If I wouldn't have got this open case, I could have been one of those to use breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and that's why I'm happy that-- I'm not happy with the situation, but I'm happy that it stopped now, and I'm only 23, and I still have my life ahead of me, and I still have time to grow with my daughter and to-- to be able to see her learn how to crawl and to walk. So I heard that you have a-- a court date coming up. Yes. I don't really know what to expect at court. I checked right into outpatient treatment. I attend five days a week, 9 to 12. I attend two NA meetings, um, outside of my treatment a week, and I'm testing clean. So I don't know what more I can do to show that I'm taking my consequences serious. You know, I-- I often share with parents that, uh, -the consequences. -I know. Not what I went through, but what I put my children through. I'm grateful that, you know, that my daughter is here and she's okay because I done fucked up. That's why I don't take off my hospital band. That's why I keep it on, 'cause it-- every day, I look at it, and I'm like, I'm doing this to get her. This is my piece of her. What a cute apartment. I told you. It's adorable. This is my side of the apartment, and that's Silvia's. That's great. Is this-- So, this is your room? -Yeah, but it's locked. -Oh, right, until, yeah-- But it wasn't locked before. No, because you have to sign paperwork. -Have you opened the room? -It's locked. -No, it's not. -They locked it. -Why would it be locked? -That's what I said. -Oh! -Why don't you think, Mary? This is new. -Hey, Silvia? -What? Are we allowed to take the plastic off the bed? I dunno. Probably. You just take it off. You got the papers? Yes, I do. Should we maybe go sit down? We have a bunch of papers we have to sign. You're gonna be stuck over there. There we go. Okay. Okay, so. We are so happy that you're finally, um, in this program, and I am especially glad you get to live with your sister. -That is just really-- -Yeah... -That is so special. I got taken away from my sisters at, like, age seven or eight, and it wasn't till I hit 14 that I found out that Silvia went back into the system, and they set us up for, like, a visit. She just seemed so happy, full of life. Like, every time we had a visit, she'd make sure I had so much fun. I turned 18, and I found out that she went into transitional housing, and they said, you know, you have the opportunity to get into this program, too, and maybe get into the same apartment as her. I was, like, excited, off the wall. I was-- I was-- you know, that's all I wanted for the longest time, to be close to somebody in my family, just 'cause it's different. There's a different connection. Well, around 2012, the State of California came out with a law to extend foster care to the age of 21 because they were finding that youth were being discharged from foster care at age 18 and they weren't prepared for life. You know, they just didn't have the funds, they didn't have the financial basis, they didn't have the education, they didn't have the life skills, and they didn't have the family support to make it on their own, so there's this huge homeless rate. But we do have expectations. You have to be either working or going to school. We do expect you to maintain your status with school, and, of course, we encourage you in every capacity that way. If you need tutors, we will get you tutors. I need tutors. -We'll do it. So, do you have any questions? Can I take off the wrap on the bedsheet? Am I allowed to do that? -Please do. -Oh, okay, okay. Uh, that would be uncomfortable to have that on there. 'Cause in some of-- in some of the foster homes-- It's on there because it's brand new. Well, in some of the foster homes, they made us sleep with that on. We couldn't-- -No, no, no. -What? They did that at the other foster homes in case there was a problem with wetting the bed. Yeah. In our program, that's your mattress. Okay. Hey, Mary, does it feel weird being here? Like, knowing this is your new home? -Yeah. -Why does it feel weird? 'Cause every time I start to get used to somewhere, I move. Hi. -I love your flower headband. Hey, you are a chubby, healthy baby. -Wow. -Yes, chubsters. Mm-hmm. We got the electroencephalogram, EEG. We didn't see any abnormal electrical activity that would tell us there's a part of her brain that is at risk for generating more seizures, but the EEG measured 45 minutes in her life. Now, it's been another three months. Um, she's five months old now, and you're not noticing anything concerning, so that is exceptional. I have no evidence that cocaine exposure caused a seizure or-- or injured her brain in a fashion which would explain the seizure that she had. When we look at the best studies of infants exposed to cocaine, methamphetamine, amphetamines, the main thing we worry about is long-term developmental issues, and it's something only time can tell. Every day, every week, every month that passes by, your daughter's risk does go down, and it makes me feel more reassured. Then I just continue to just monitor the way how I've been? Absolutely. Miss Beavers. You guys can sit right there. The county really wanted Sydney adopted. Sydney said, "I'm not going nowhere. I'm not leaving my mom. I'm not leaving my church. I'm not leaving my sisters. I'm not leaving nobody." And so the lady said, "Miss Beavers, how do you feel?" I said, "I feel like Sydney feel. She doesn't wanna go and she don't have to go." And so, now we are ready to close the case, and, um, Sydney is in agreement with closure, and we'll be submitting on the department's recommendation today. All right. She is in the-- in a permanent placement. She is in a legal guardianship. So, at this time, uh, the court believes that continued supervision by the, uh, court is no longer necessary, and jurisdiction is terminated. -So, that'll conclude the matter. -What? Jurisdiction's terminated. You do not have to come back to court anymore. -Yes! Yay. And, Your Honor, I think Sydney wanted to, um, say something. -All right? -I wanna thank all you guys for being there for me. You're very welcome. Great. Thank you, Your Honor. -Thank you so much. -Thank you, Miss Beavers, for coming to court. No more court. Well, now you are part of the Beavers family. Yes! -Beavers. -Wasn't she always? -Not like she is now. She's now legally. Now, she's a legal part of it. -Whoa. -Before, she was just, um... What makes her such a great mom is because she just got me, and she kept me here for three years and legal guardianed me, and now I can just live my life happy. Calling number nine on today's calendar for jurisdiction and disposition hearings. Are there any issues concerning notice for today? No, Your Honor. I have read and considered and admit the jurisdiction disposition report provided by the department, and the recommendation is to dismiss the petition. Does anyone wish to be heard? The parents have been very cooperative. They obviously love their child, and they're doing all they can. So I think the, uh, the picture is pretty good here, uh, and I'm glad they received this recommendation. Thank you, Mr. Brussel. Uh, Miss Rak, wish to be heard? Your Honor, we're in agreement with the dismissal. Thank you. Uh, I am, as well. So, the petition is dismissed pursuant to section 301. That's it, folks. -Thank you. -Thank you. Congratulations. So just continue what you're doing, okay? Yes, ma'am. And if you have any questions, you can call me. Got good news, baby. You can come back home. I can get more sleep. Shut up. You're stuck with me now. Say, "Yay." Yes, you're with mama. Yes, you're with mama. -Hey, big girl. -Hey, butterfly. Yes, mama. I can go spend the night with her tonight for the first time. With no worries. What happened to the book? Oh, here it is. Okay, so, can we pick any chapter we want? -Mm-hmm. -Okay. Noah? Yeah, here. The last one, 106. -"Justice Prevails." -I haven't got... When you disrupt a cycle for me, you save Noah and Jonah, too. My kids are forever changed because of the trajectory that I'm on now. -Stop looking at me! I don't wanna throw away the child welfare system. I want to help restructure it. And maybe we'll discover that when other people are healthy in our communities, that we actually thrive, too. There are other Jessicas. My mission in life is to find me and to save me. All right, good night, you guys. I believe that there is gonna be someone who's just waiting for someone to give them one more chance, and that's gonna be me. Good afternoon, Mr. Totten. -How are you, Dasani? -Amazing. Great. -What's that? -Amazing. You are? Well, you don't look that way to me. Yes, he is. All right. All right, you do. All right. So, um, I got a report that says you heard me last time 'cause I was upset, and you-- I'm very impressed. It says, "Outstanding effort, respectful." Since your last court date, you've been doing excellent behavior. Um, went on a camping trip. Uh, went fishing, hiking, snow play, chopped wood. May I, for the record? Yes, Miss Soung. I have submitted, on behalf of Dasani, four documents. Um, one is a letter from his school, documenting how, uh, well he's doing, that he finished out the school year. He's in a summer school program. He is actually doing a paid internship. Um, you've also received a letter from, um, the camping trip group, uh, also affirming how well he was on the trip and a clear leader in the group, and also documentation that he's completed 48 hours of community service at the school. He's also done additional community service at the group home, so we estimate he's done approximately 60 to 70 community service hours. There is also a letter from Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services that Dasani has gone to every appointment for weekly therapy that's been scheduled. Good stuff. All right. So, we left off last time, I said, "Hey, where's the-- where's the flow?" Yeah, got the flow right here for y'all. -You got it? -Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

And having seen all kinds of talent in this court, I think that's a ten. -Aww, that's great. You've come a long way from somebody who was constantly getting stoned, breaking things, hurting people. Wouldn't know it was the same person. Just really proud of the growth you've shown. I know you're gonna miss us, but I'm thinkin' that we're done. What do you think? -I think I'm ready. -You're ready? Okay. So, I need you to come on up. Congratulations. You're gonna be terminated, graduated from our program. I'm very proud of you. Keep up the good work. Great potential. Don't give it up, all right? Don't give it up. Good job. I wanna thank Mr. Totten. You feel me? 'Cause although he put my ass behind them bars, he also taught me a lot of positive things. You feel me? And now I'm on a better road. You feel me? If I was never on probation, I probably would've been down that-- down that same road, doing the same thing I was doing. If not, just locked back up. But Totten was always in the back of my head. He still is, and it's crazy 'cause I'm off probation, but I still be thinkin' about Totten, like, oh, it's gonna be a different Commissioner Totten if I do the same shit. Feel me? -We done, brother. -Ah, congratulations, man. Whew. Let's get the fuck outta here, bro. The reason I went back to college this semester is I started seeing it more as a-- as a privilege to be able to be there. Having a degree is something nobody can take away from you. And I'm taking a bunch of theater courses, so that's definitely made me want to come to class. Yeah, just go-- make sure you go get your power. You're not gonna let her give you that power. You can't always write the beginning to your story, but you can definitely write the end. My past does make a lot of who I am, but that title, the-- the foster kid, the girl with the social worker, that does not define me at all. I just feel like my purpose here is much bigger than just my past. That's what I'm-- I'm-- I'm-- I'm figuring out. That's what I'm chasing, and that's what I'm-- I'm fighting for. My favorite quote does come from Audrey Hepburn. It is, "Nothing is impossible. Even the word itself says, 'I'm possible.'" There we go. Lord, we just thank you for this day. We thank you for this Mother's Day, a special day. I have so much to be grateful for. You know, just to have us all together. I'm grateful for you to be my mom, and I love you too much. -Too much? -That's sweet. Casi, you wanna say something? Say, "Happy Mother's Day, Mom." -Happy Mother's Day. A lot of people look around, and we use terms like, oh, this is, you know, foster sister, or foster brother, or adopted, and all that stuff, but we don't use those terms in this house. We just use the term, "This is my sister. This is my brother." We just welcome them in our house. I'm just grateful that my mom has taught me to be like that. Words can't describe how much I love you. You've always been there for me, and you've never given up even if I stress you out a lot. You've been there through thick and thin, and you even came off your vacation getaway to tend for my bad self. You are the carbo to my hydrate, the eco to my system. I love you more than science, and I love you more than the number of atoms in a human body. P.S. There is about 100 trillion atoms in the human body. -Denyshia. This is my-- this is my honors student. And I would like to award you this award behalf of the Adoptive -and-- and Foster Co... -What? ...Inc. Look it. How does she know that? She is too smart. -Too smart, Denyshia. When I get older, and I have enough money, I'm gonna buy her a house, and a car, and then someone to take care of her. Or, if she doesn't want that, she can come live in my big house. Like, she can have the west wing of the house. Every three months, I'll send her to trips, so she can have a break, 'cause, you know, she needs breaks. And then I will just give her everything she wants and then, like, care for her like she did for me. I would like to take care of her for the stuff she's been doing for me, and I would also like to give her her own coffee shop, 'cause she loves coffee a lot. -How you know about that? I was brought up with a lotta kids and a lotta love. My mom taught us to love each other no matter what, and I teach my kids that now. Love your mom and your dad. They couldn't take care of you guys. They have a problem, but you got to love them 'cause they're still your mom and-- and your dad. You can't not like them, say they're not your mom. They are. I'm just fillin' in for them till they get better. Some will get better, and some won't, but you have to have hope that they're gonna get better. ♪ Some days I look in the mirror ♪ ♪ And I think The meanest things ♪ ♪ Oh, the meanest things ♪ ♪ Some days I'm holding My self-worth up ♪ ♪ By a string ♪ ♪ A string ♪ ♪ But every day that I don't Hide myself away ♪ ♪ To me is a tiny victory ♪ ♪ Some days Giving up on myself looks so ♪ ♪ So easy to do It's so easy to do ♪ ♪ The struggle is slow I'm barely moving the needle ♪ ♪ And the cracks may be few ♪ ♪ But there's light Coming through ♪ ♪ And if battles Can win a war ♪ ♪ I can keep picking My sword up off the floor ♪ ♪ And learn to treasure these ♪ ♪ Tiny victories ♪ ♪ Tiny victories ♪ ♪ Tiny victories ♪ ♪ Tiny victories ♪ ♪ Every day that I don't Hide myself away ♪ ♪ Every day that I don't Hide myself away ♪ ♪ To me ♪ ♪ Is a tiny victory ♪ Subtitles from Wonder Woman
