- What's up, boy? - What you doin' here, Silk? - Figured it might be a good time, you know, for me to pay my tithes. Come on, man. Look, look, my sister already told me the organ's busted. Come on, man. Just trying to pay my tithes. - You don't ever do anything unless it got something to do with you. - Come on, man. No, no, no, seriously, it's for the church, man. You give me something, I give you something. - What's your game? - I ain't got no game. Just wanna give this to the church. - What do you get out of it? - I want you to cover me in prayer. That's it. - That's all you want? To be covered in prayer? - That's it, that's all. I want you to cover me in prayer. Sinners need prayer, too. Bow my head, I close my eyes, you put your hand on my shoulder or somethin', what? Come on, let's go. - You wanna be covered? - Yeah, that's right. - Cover yourself. - What? Proverbs 13:22. "And all the wealth of the sinners will be stored up "for the righteous." - Take care, Silk. - You know, I love what you did with the place, you know what I'm sayin'? It's kinda cool. I like the car, too. You should come work for me. Tellin' you, I could put a thousand dollars in your pocket a week, even more. Yeah, even more. This place needs it. - You know I don't do that. - I love the minivan. It looks good on you, too. Reliable. Safe. Economic. - Hey baby. I went to the church again. I'm not ready. You know, L.J. and Sandra keep trying to get me to go up in there, but... It's not the same without you. You know I was thinking the other day, maybe I should sit down and write. I been talking to these different people about survivor's guilt. So many folks out there. I won't light it, I won't light it. I see you in my dreams. Baby is alive. The three of us are happy. - God, God, yessir, yessir. Let me tell you something, Preacher. You sure enough preached that thing today, boy. - They um, they really seemed like they was into it today. - Amen, amen. - Praise God. - Hey. Monies for the day. - A whole $120? - Yeah, the whole $120. Look here, don't go spending that all in one place. - Where I'm gonna spend it at? $120. - Well, you know you can give it back to me. - Don't you play with the Lord's money. - Man. Well, how's everything going out there? - Everything's good, man. Well, you heard the organ, right? - Yeah, I wanted to ask you about that, 'cause it sound like an old dyin' cat. - Yeah. A dying cat that died twice. - Ooh. What's going on with it? - Yeah that thing's dead. The organ is gone, it's dead. Yeah, we gonna need a new one of those, for sure, but if we don't increase our tithes and offering, I mean, we might have to shut down our pantry box... - No, no, no. Lavar, we can't do that because if we do that, then the summer camp's gonna suffer man. - I know, I know. I was looking forward to that event. - We gonna need that miracle soon. - Indeed. - But is there any good news? - Yeah, yeah. We fed over 100 homeless people this morning. - Your work, praise God. Now, next time, you might wanna lead with that. - With that one? - Yeah, with that one, right. - I got you. - With that particular one. - Gotcha, copy, copy. - Bring the confidence up. - I understand, I understand. I got your back. - Alright. - Look here man, I'm gonna get up on outta here. - Go on, go ahead, alright. - Alright, mother? I'm gonna take that box on over to Mother Carey's, okay? - No, no, you ain't gotta worry about it. I'll take it over there. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - You don't mind? - No, I'm good, go ahead. - Alright, see ya tomorrow. - See ya tomorrow. See ya tomorrow bright and early. - We gonna pray on that miracle, too. - Go on, head on outta here. He can only bless so many things, so many things. - He's still working with me. - Get on outta here. - Hey, Pastor. Let me hold something. - Get out. Get out, get out. - See ya tomorrow, man. - Go on, Levar. - Mama, you could probably see better if you took your shades off. - Girl, I forgot my glasses. Thank you so much. - Take this... - No, no, no, I got this. Your money is no good here. - Okay, thank you, Mama. - Plus you know, I got these papers I want you to look at. - Okay. - You know, from Social Security. They make these things so hard. - Well, you might wanna clean out your purse. - Well, so how much is it? How much do I owe you? - I thought you said you forgot your glasses? - You know how forgetful I am. How much do I owe you? - Mama, take off your shades. - No, I think I really... - Mama, take off, take them off! - It's just a little... - A little what? What, what? He didn't mean to? That's what you always say! - Keep your voice down! You're puttin' my business in the street! Sandra! - Mama Carey?

Gonna make sure that you are good and you... - I know. - That's alright. - I'll be glad when the season change and we get a little relief from this... - Well, it cooled down a little bit. - Heat now. - But I wanted to make sure I saw you before I went home for the night, just make sure everything was alright. That's some good lemonade. - Thank you. - That's good. - Let me see. - That is good, Mama Carey. - Well, little bit too much lemon for my taste. - Too much lemon in it for your taste? - I can do better than this. - Well, I'll tell you what. I'm going back to the church, get you another box and then we can have some more lemonade when I get back. - Okay. - Yes ma'am. And while you gone, I'm gonna make us another batch of lemonade. - Alright, that sound like a plan. - Alright. - Alright, I'll see you in a minute, alright? - Alright, darling, thank you. - Alright. - I'm gonna throw a couple of samples in here for you, if I can grab it, alright, there we go. And we have a shipment every week, so come back and we will get you all fixed up. - That sounds wonderful. Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Thank you for shopping at the. - Thank you, have a great day. - Bye, you too. Thank you. - Girl another sale? You are on fire. This just might work. - Yes, I'm feeling it.

It was that bad? - Yes, it, yeah. - Wow. My outfit is gonna be on fleet, by the way. - It's like that? - Yes, baby. - Okay, well we are too old to use that word, by the way. Um, let's wrap things up so we can be outta here not one minute past five. - Gotcha. - Hey, Miss Phillips, I hope you're blessed today. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it, I got. - Can you please put the new member forms on my desk? - I don't know how Sandra drives this car. Wow, look at him, folks. The champ's making his way back. What's happening man? That's an interesting choice in supplement there. I'll have to tell my patients. Gotta let me know how it's working for ya. - Yeah, wanna beer? - Yes, yes I do. - So I got tickets to the show tonight, four tickets. - Four tickets? Who else is coming? - Me, you, Sandra and a a friend of hers from work. You remember Sheila from the birthday party, don't you? - Yeah. - Yeah, I'm worried about you if you didn't. - Long as you and Sandra don't run off somewhere. - Nobody's trying to hook you up, I swear it. Plus my attention's gonna be on the show, anyway. - The attention needs to be on your wife. - Don't worry about it. - Let me ask you a question. - This is good. - Who's the first person you think about in the morning? - Sandra. - Okay. Then who's the last person you think about at night? - Let me see this. Um, Beyonce. - You a fool. - So? - What time is the show? - Um, nine, but meet us there at 7:30 out front, alright? - I'll be there. - You be there. - Promise, you gonna hold? - So, I'll see ya later. - Hey yo Silk? How long we gotta wait out here for this kid? - As long as it takes. Why, you got somewhere to be? - Naw, I'm good. - Hey, I'm about to take off for the night. You working late? - Yeah, yeah, I was just taking a few things, then I'm gonna go ahead and head on out, too. - Alright. - Something on your mind? - How long we go back? - Come on, Levar, I'm tired now. - Just answer the question, man. - Well, if I gotta answer, you know we go back further than Old Man Jones hairline. - That's right, that's right. Never too late, never too soon. - Brothers from the womb to the tomb. - Yeah, I'm just saying anybody who knows you knows that I was there, man, you know? From the running and the hustling, I was right there. I done seen all that shh... - Whoa, hold on. - Shoot. - Hold on, watch yourself, brother. - You know what I'm saying. Long way, I mean, think about, you remember that time when you left your drink on the table and somebody spiked it with something? Man, before we knew it, you were picking a fight with the bouncer. He put all outta there. - Yeah, yeah not one of my finer moments, you know? I'm glad I don't remember it. - Yeah, well. We did a lot of childish things back then. I know you didn't come all the way in here now to just take a stroll down memory lane? What's on your mind? - It's like this, you know. What you do on your personal time is your personal business. - The plane, land it Levar, land the plane. - Alright, one of those childish things that we were supposed to put away when we became men, is out in the parking lot. - Yo, stop fidgeting man. Why you moving so much? - I'm just saying, what are we doing here anyway? Man, you been acting real funny since Big Boy's funeral. - I need you to trust me, alright? - Hold up, hold up. There's like, $10,000 in here, what's this? - I know, I know. - So where did it come from? I don't wanna know. - Levar, look. You know me, you know me. I need you to trust me on this, alright? It's not what you think. It's not what you think. - So what you want me to do, man? - Buy a new organ, alright? And then take whatever's left, put half of it it the pantry and the other half on the summer camp program, alright? Just take care of it. - What I should do with my piece, no, no, no, tell me, tell me. Tell me what I need to do, since you got so much to say. - I'm just gonna be quiet. - What? 'Cause that's the side I like in you, the quiet side. Keep it that way. - Where your boy? - Hold my cigar. - Well? - You know what I'm saying? That's how I paid in the church. You know, they'll get up and they'll ask for an offer and then... - Hey, sweet, we lucked out. It's a good table? - Yeah, it is, it's really good. - So you know what? It's time for a offering now. - Sheila, you ever been here before? - I haven't but Sandra told me that the crab cakes are off the chain. - They are, but I have to stay away from shellfish. - Since when? - You don't remember your conference? I had the shrimp and it made my throat all itchy. - I thought that was peanuts. - Do you think I'm making this all up? - I didn't say that. - Sandra, I have to go freshen my lipstick. Will you come with me? Come on. - Must be something in this church. He's saying alright, y'all. We just heard from the Lord. I said good night. I just heard from the deacon. He said I wanna let y'all know, we're gonna need 50 more dollars. And we ain't going nowhere. - What is wrong? - I'm okay, I'm okay. It's just, all this stuff that's going on with my mama, and I just don't need him adding on to... - No, no, he is a good man, okay? Be grateful. I'm in my prime and I'm still looking. - You're right. - My goodness. Speaking of looking, I don't remember Manny looking so fine. - Girl, stop, I'm serious. I'm just admiring his handsomeness, that's all. - Well, I saw him admiring something on you... - You know what? You are so silly. - Hey. - Sorry. - You're forgiven. And I didn't say anything negative about you behind your back when you went to the restroom. I really didn't say anything, no. - Whatever. - Okay, maybe I bitched a little. That's alright. - You know, I want y'all commune with me when I ask you, I'm gonna point at y'all, I want y'all to say, you know your church is ghetto. And then I'm gonna tell you why your church is ghetto. - You know your church is ghetto. - When you get there, you're passing out hobo grilling. - You know your church is ghetto. - What you did to the offering and I mean, keep the church and your pastor got three baby mamas sitting in the front row. - We need to take a five minute intermission. When we come back, we're gonna hear from Sherel Riley. - So, Sheila, did you enjoy the show? - I did. Good music, good food, good company. - Well did you enjoy the show? - Absolutely, you know I love Jones. Got all his albums. - Me too. - Ooh, they got something in common. Look at that. - That's right honey. I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse my wife. She was a cupid or something in a past life. - You know what? My mom would try to fix me up for years, so I'm used to it, so... - Yeah? - Really, alright. - Do you guys want a lift? - No, I'm taking a cab. - Yeah, I Ubered here, so... - Well maybe you guys can take a car together. Uber together. - Okay. - Yeah, I'll call. - don't you ever disrespect me in public again. - But baby, you told me to st... - I don't care what I said. - Well, I... - I do what I wanna do. - Okay, okay, okay. I understand, but that was money for the grocery bill. - You get paid Friday. - But I am not the bank! - I am gonna... I don't care what you do. You know what? I'll tell you what. - Take your hands off her. Take your hands off her. - My God, no wait, please. He's having a heart attack, please call the police! Help! - So, nothing happened? - No, nothing. Why do you sound so disappointed? - I mean, I woulda thought you'd get like, a kiss on the cheek or something. - I know, that would have been kinda nice. - You see? Thank you. So, when are you two going out again? - I don't know. I haven't talked to him, at all. - He hasn't called you? - No. - Okay, have you called him? - I tried, but he didn't answer. - Okay, okay, alright. You're gonna go over there. - What? - Yep. - That is gonna make me look so desperate. - But you are. - You are not right! - I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Sheila, I'm kidding. It's a joke, okay? But seriously, alright. Manny, he's just now getting back to his old self. I mean, he went into seclusion when he lost his family, so. - So, you're saying I should just show up at his door? - I mean, I think that you taking the initiative will show him that he's safe with you. Yeah, yeah? - I don't wanna it to make it seem like I'm chasing him. - But you aren't, right? This is different. - Come on. - Okay. - Yes! I'm gonna text you his address. Alright and let me know when you have it. - Got it. - Cool. Alright, let's bless the food. Heavenly Father we come to you saying thank you. Thank you for this day, thank you for this business and thank you for this food that we're about to receive and thank you that Sheila's gonna go over to Manny's house. Amen. - I hate you. So hard. I just wanna be with my family. You took them! You took them from me! I'm coming. - Jesus. - What are you doin'? What are you looking for? - Nothing. Where'd you hide her? Where is she? - Who? - In here? - Who are you talking about? - How'd it go with Sheila? - Is that who you're looking for? - You got any beer in the fridge? - No. Yeah. - Yeah ya do. Jesus, boy. So, how'd it go with Sheila? - It went fine. You happy? Nothing happened. - Let me get a jag. Parked it down the street. You see the look on that old man's face? - You think that's funny? - What's going on with you? First, you hanging out with the Pastor, now you crying over a old school that needed his head bashed in for putting his hands on that... - Come on, man, we don't, we don't do it like that. - But that's what we do. What, you put a pistol in his face, Catch the Holy Ghost? You think he's supposed to what? - If you think that's how it goes down, maybe this ain't for me no more. - Naw, it's for you. What ain't for you is that pastor. You drop him and we get goin'. - Let me tell you something. It come down to that pastor or you, I'm picking that pastor. - Alright. Well, then maybe I need to go down there and have a little man-to-man conversation with that pastor, put some hands on him. - Let me tell you something. You don't go no where near him. You understand that? - Yeah, got you. Where my drink? What's funny? What's funny? - Hey. - Sheila. - Hi. - What are you doing here? - I was just in the neighborhood, thought I might stop by. - Really? - Did I catch you at a bad time? - No. - Can I come in? - Absolutely. Hey let me take that for you. - Thank you. - That's so cool. I appreciate you coming with food. - Thank you, I didn't know you had company. - Hi Sheila. What a surprise. - No, no. He was just leaving. - I was? I thought we were... That's right. I have a thing, it's very important. - Yeah, that thing. - I've got to get to a thing. - That thing, yeah, that thing we talked about. Okay. - Yeah and my beer's finished, so I mean, it's perfect timing. - Yeah, got those things to do. - Alright, well don't do anything I would do, okay? - You two, you two are pathetic. - Got to work on our non-verbals, obviously. - I hope you haven't eaten yet. I wanted to whip you up a little something. - I had a snack earlier, but I can eat. It's very thoughtful of you. I mean, what's on the menu? - Well, salmon... - Salmon. - With a raspberry chipotle glaze. - Alright. - Pan seared squash and a fully loaded salad. - Well, well. Sounds too good to be true. I'm gonna go change. Kitchen is all yours. - Alright. Excuse me, excuse me. I'm looking for my husband. He just... - Mrs. Thomas? - Yes, yes, that's me. - I'm Dr. Freeman. - How is he? - Are you here alone? - Yes, yes, how is he? - We are prepping him for surgery. I will be performing the coronary artery bypass. He's has 90% blockage. I will try and repair his heart valve to get an even flow back to his heart. - No. - The surgery should take about four hours. You know, I know it's gonna be hard, but try to get some rest. You know, if you have anyone who can come and be with you, now is a good time to call them. - Thank you, doctor. - I'll ask Joseph to come and get you before we take him to the operation room. - Thank you again, doctor. - He's in good hands. Okay, okay. - Pastor. Can I talk to you for a second? - Alright. I see some things never change. - I need you to do something for me. - What is it? - I need you to cover me in prayers again. - What you need, Silk? - Please, man, just cover me in prayers again. I got to tell you something. - Go ahead. - I think I killed this old man today. - Wait, you did what? - I mean, this old man was beating up on his old lady, so I stepped in, next thing I know, he's having a heart attack. - Do you know, are you for sure that he's dead? - Come on man. I didn't sit around there to wait and find out. Come on, please. Cover me in prayer. Please. - Our Father God. You said in Your word, Father God that we can come boldly before the throne with reverential fear. I come before that throne, Father God to pray for my brother Samuel, Father God. In many ways, Father, he may have lost his way, but we know that Father Go... - Thanks, man, thanks. Thanks, thanks. Mama asked about you. - That's not my mother. And I'm surprised her better half, that reverend, I'm surprised he never ran you off like he, like he ran me off. - She only practically raised us. The only thing we agree on... - Yeah, well... - Is him. - Somebody's discipline is also someone else's abuse. - You know, when I saw him today, it took everything in my spirit not to put my hands on him. - That's too bad you didn't. Probably made him a better reverend. Here, man, here. I gotta go. Now, I put a couple extra hundred in there, so you know, you make sure you treat yourself, man. Get yourself a nice meal and if nothing else, please, get yourself a nice suit. - I can't keep doing this. - Look man, I gotta go, man, I gotta go. Alright, I gotta go. - One day, one day something'll catch up with you. - What do you, what do you want? Your father's in the ICU. He had a heart attack last night. Sandra, you hear me? - Where are you? - I'm at Baylor. - Okay, I'll be there as soon as I can. How is he? - He just came out of surgery. They did a triple bypass on him. - Doctors told him about his drinking and smoking. - He wasn't drinking and he hasn't a cigarette in months now. You could act a little more concerned. - I'm concerned about you. - That is still your father. - That is not my father. If they would have known what kind of man they had on that table, they would have let him die. - Sandra, dear. Sandra, I'm so sorry. Baby, I'm so sorry. - Let go of my arm. Let you stand by your man like you always do. - Mrs. Thomas? - Yes. - The surgery was a success. He's really strong. - We've done everything we can, but what he needs more than anything right now is prayer. - Thank you, doctor. - Of course. - There is something about a man in a nice suit. - Shh, I'll tell you what. It certainly feels better than those polyester blends. - This is your uniform, Pastor. Look, a nice suit exudes confidence. - Yeah, but I don't know if I should spend this much on just one suit. - No, you should, and deservingly so. Yeah? - Alright, I'll take it. - Alright, just hand it to me when you're done and I'll get it to the tailor. - Okay. - You know what? I'm gonna throw in this watch and these cufflinks too. Yeah, 'cause, yeah. - This is real nice. - Yeah. - Man, look at that. These cufflinks. - Um, thank you? - No, thank you. - Look, you know Miss Carey's my mother, right? She told me that you brought her groceries the other day and that you left $120 there for her. - I don't, I don't know what to say. God bless you. Thank you. - I'm gonna ring these up in the back. - Alright. - We're closed. I said we're closed. - Hello, son. - What you want? - I missed you and I wanted to see you. Your brother came by the house. - I'm not gonna ask you again, alright? - Why are you so angry? - What can I do for you? - I was going through some things the other day, and I came across this, thought you should have it. - A bible? - I laughed so hard when I used to catch you and Malcolm playing at being the reverend. We were so sure you were going to be the one to follow in his footsteps. You had, you have the calling all over you. Can I have a hug before I go? I love you and God loves you and it's time you came home. - Well that's, that's funny because I keep having this dream where I'm coming home. - God is working on you. I can feel it. And the moment you stop fighting it, you'll see the wonders of His love. - Well, thanks for bringing me the bible. I really, I gotta close up shop. - Shhh. - Come on now. A bible? - Is that a new suit and watch, Pastor? - Yeah, yeah. Yes it is. Well, you wear it well. I already put the new member forms on your desk. - Okay, well thank you. - Yes. Looking good. Looking good. - Hey boss, you know I was tripping earlier so I just wanna make sure... - Listen, listen, forget that. Did you spill my oil? - Your oil? - Yeah, it was almost full. It was up to here. Now, it's almost empty. - Yo, what's going on with you, man? Some oil? What is this, man? We out here trying to make money, you talking about some oil? - Look, I'm telling you, man. I know you spilled my oil. Alright? It was almost full. - You slippin'. Something's going on with you. You need to get your mind right. - I got my mind right. I'm not stupid. It was all full and now it's all empty. - Get it together. These cats, they eat your lunch, alright? - We gonna do this or what? - The bag. - What's up with your boy? - Relax, hey, O. O, come on. Hurry up. - Better get him outta there! - Hey, hey, you need to relax. You need to relax. - You need to relax. You need to pull him out. - Chill out, chill out, alright? We good. Silk, we good, alright? Look in the bag. Easy. - Thanks for coming to get me. I called Larry but he didn't answer his phone, so. You know what? If it wasn't for my mama, I wouldn't have even gone up there. What is this? What is this? - What was that? All you gotta do is bring the bag out. - You gonna put this on me? You gonna put this on me? - Yeah, you got one job. - Let me tell you, you know what? - you don't have to answer that. - What's that got to do with anything? - What's this got? That's what I'm saying. - You got one job. Bring the money out. - What money? - What are you doing? Are you crazy? - I just... - Are you out of your mind? - You had a gun in a cemetery. You're not good. - I'm fine. Now I gotta go back and get my gun. - I got you. - Caught the end of your service. Made me wanna come up there and get saved. - That so? How'd you even get in here? - I just need you to cover me in prayers. - What is it, man? What'd you do? - Come on. Just, just cover me in prayers. I'm ready to go home. I'm ready to go home. - You are home. Stay with me, stay with me, alright? Stay with me. - It's okay, I'm ready to go home. - Pastor, what's going on? - Just call an ambulance now. - Ready to go home. - You're not finished, you're not finished. Call an ambulance. - Yes, hi, we need an ambulance. - You're not finished. - At 1901 Crenshaw Drive, back of the church. - Are they on the way? - Listen, listen just hurry up. Heavenly Father, Heavenly Father we stand before You right now standing in deep prayer of our Father. We don't know what brought him in this condition, but we know that it's not by coincidence that he is here at Your house today. Heavenly Father, please, send down Your angels of mercy upon us, send down Your angels of mercy, please Lord. Cover him and watch him, keep him dear Lord, shh... - Why y'all praying for this boy? He ain't doing nothing to sell no drugs. The bible says you live by the sword so shall be written you reap what you sow, by the sword. - Shh, Sister Jenkins, please. - You ain't got to shush me twice. I'm calling the police. Heathen in here selling drugs like it's a dad-gum grocery store. - So, what's the latest? - The doctors say he's not responding to treatment. His blood pressure just keeps dropping. - Have you gotten any rest? Have you eaten anything? - No, baby. - Ma, you still need to take care of yourself. - I can't. I wanna be here when he wakes up. - I promise you, if he wakes up, I'll come get you. - Listen, I am staying right here. - Mama, I don't want to fight with you. Okay? If you get sick, you won't be here for him. - You promise you'll come and get me? - I promise. - Baby, you know why I stay with your daddy? Because I wanna prove to him that I love him more than he loves me. - But he hits you... - He loves me, that is all. I know without a shadow of a doubt that he loves me. Whatever you think he is doing to me, he saved me. Trust me, I am telling you that he saved me. His is the only love that I have ever known. I owe him everything. - Just do us all a favor and die. - Here you go, Detective. Samuel Wiggins, but they call him Silk. - Okay, thank you. - Pastor, I have your shirt. - So you have no idea of how he got in here or who shot him? - No, officer, it's like I told you... - Detective. - Excuse me, Detective, it's like I told you when I came into the office he was, he was there in that chair. - All due respect, Pastor Stevens, but I'm just trying to understand how one of the biggest drug dealers in the city could get into your office without anybody seeing him? Why would he come here instead of going someplace else? - Well, maybe it's because me and Silk grew up together. Practically from birth. That's no secret. - So, what's your relationship now? - Pastor, we gotta go. - There's no, no relationship. I see him every once in a while. - And what do you talk about? - Pastor, we gotta go. I got your shirt, okay? - Same old song and dance we've always done. I talk to him about turning his life around and he always tells me he's working for the other guy. - Has he ever talked to you specifically about his business? - Why would he? - Naw, I mean, you said the both of you go way back, so I figured well maybe, you know, he'd wanna confide in his homie. You know, the good Reverend. - Listen, Detective. Now I know no one may cry a river over Samuel, but what I see is someone who's still trying to turn their life around, that's what I see. And I understand you have a job to do, but my focus here is on a human being that's clinging to life. Alright, that's what my focus is. So, unless we have anything else here, can I get cleaned up and get outta here? - Naw, I think we're about done. Yeah, I'm gonna ask ya some more questions in a few days and don't make any plans to take a trip anywhere until we get this cleared up, okay? - Well, Detective, you'll know where to find me. - Thank you, thank you, come on. - Paging Dr. Bender, paging Dr. Bender. Are you the doctor? - Excuse me, are you Mr. Wiggins' family? - Yes, he's my foster brother and I'm his pastor. - Hi, I'm Dr. Quan. Well, it's a good thing we got to him when we did. He did lose a lot of blood. We were able to stop any further bleeding. - Okay, okay. - One of the bullets perforated his stomach and the other lodged between C4 and C5 vertebrae of his spine. It's too early to take it out. - Can I go see him? - Just a little bit. - I'm live outside Bethany United Church. A man identified as 39 year old Samuel Wiggins walked inside the church sometime around 11 this morning bleeding from what we're told was a gunshot wound. - Hey honey, come here. - He was found in Pastor Malcolm Stevens' office unconscious on the floor. - Baby, come here, this is what I was talking about this morning. - Rushed to Baylor University Medical Hospital, last listed in critical condition. - Honey come on, you're gonna miss it. - When I asked the mega-pastor for a comment, he declined to speak with us. - Baby. - Shh. Stop yellin', I hear you. - Somebody got shot at the church. - Now let's send you to Angela over at the hospital. - What? - Found him in Pastor Stevens' office. - My... - Wait, here it comes right here. - Where Samuel Wiggins was rushed after being shot. - Do you know this guy here? - Just, shh. - His foster father also tell... - My gosh. - Are you okay? - Yeah, no, yeah I'm okay.

People might start to get the wrong idea. - And what idea might that be? - I know you took the money from Silk. But don't you worry. Your secret's safe with me. I'm sure we can work out some type of arrangement. - Blessed is the man that endures temptation for when he is tried, this, this, this ain't gonna happen. You just need to leave.

There was no reason for... Don't you say another word. You see, because the bible says uttereth not a word from a man who is full of sin.

The other reason is how my father was horrifying. He terrorized my family when I was young and... Now it's sad to say but I didn't want anyone who, the same height, build, skin complexion that remotely resembled him. I wanted to be able to give my heart without feeling like I... Tired.

Okay, okay. So that's why he's been coming around? Being around the church 'cause he feels like he owes you. That's why he gave you the money. - It's always something, and this time, it was, he just wanted to pay his tithes and be covered in prayer. But every time, every time I help him, I lose. But I shoulda never took that money. I did that. I took the money. - Yeah, yeah, you did. You did that, so what? Look man, we're human, right? What does it say in the word?

Excuse me, no excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me. This is ridiculous. What we're not gonna do is we're not gonna sit up here and condemn this man. That's what we're not gonna do. Who is without sin cast the first stone. Let me say that. Let me say that. We know that Brother Malcolm has been our leader and pastor for the past four years... - Under false pretenses. - He has made the congre... He has grown this congregation. Under his ministry we have built a charter school for the children's ministry... - With funny money. - Okay? - Come on. - Okay, yeah, so what? Yes, the money was dirty, okay, what would Jesus do? He would do the same thing. He would, he would... - The bible says blessed not ye the man who make monies of the ways of perverse. - Okay, hold on. Sister Mary, Sister Mary. When your mama needed that operation, when she was going through chemotherapy, did you say, "No, Pastor. "We don't want this money to help Mama. "We don't want that." When your children couldn't eat? You needed money for food and you needed school supplies? When we did that fund raiser, we had all that... - What is your point? - What are we saying? - What are you doing here? - I am still pastor of this church, until the vote happens. - You are not supposed to be here. - Mrs. Jenkins. - I came here to fight for my church. - What? - Please. - Please what? - Shut up. - Well, I never. - I know I've stood up here many Sundays as your pastor, but the truth is, I'm just a man and I face temptation like any other man. That's what I face. I'll be the first to admit I'm not perfect and I allowed my own desires to fuel and run me at times and I knew at some point that I'd have to reconcile those decisions, all of those decisions, and that God would hold me accountable. So, knowing that He will hold me accountable, I just, I thought to myself, as long as I continue to do, though, Father, what I thought was what He wanted me to do, I could somehow put off this day. I don't even know to say this. The truth is, plain and simple, I messed up and then I tried to cover it up. But I realize now that nothing, nothing's worth separating me from God. Nothing. And I knew that I'd have to own up to the consequences of my decisions. I know, I know some of you might leave the church because of this, I understand that. But what I ask to each and every one of you is, don't let your faith be damaged by the actions of one man. - Okay, you've had your say. Thank you very much. Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is your time to vote and remember, you vote no Or yes. Our church deserves better. - However you vote, however that is, don't harden your hearts. I pray for your forgiveness. And I pray that you all allow me the opportunity to show you all the pastor that I can be. Thank you for your time. - Well, alright. So, it's time. All those in favor of the pastor, stand. Raise your hand and say yea. Yea. - All the no's. - Pastor. Come back, come here. - A heart that forgives.
