Hello? I just landed 30 minutes ago, Dad. Hey, are you OK? It's over. You're safe. I'm sorry, where are my manners? My name is Quan. I'm Dung. You have a cute name. I have never seen such a lovely girl before. Is it love at first sight? Mind if I ask... do you believe in destiny? My luggage! Hey! Wait for me! After that, we were madly in love. She was the girl of my dreams. Did you know that seahorses mate for life? And that was our vow to one another. Before long, I proposed to her and she made me the happiest man in the world. HO CHI MINH CITY A year later, I want to divorce. I really have nothing to wear! Nothing! I'm not whining, but if I was, it'd be OK, right? Everyone has problems. And it's OK to whine about them! I've got enough on my plate. And you're always at work! What else can I do but whine? Honey! The washing machine broke down again. How many times do I have to tell you? Last week, and the week before, I told you to have it fixed. Do you ever listen to me? I'm not wrong, am I? Why aren't you saying anything? I'll have a look at it later. How many times have you said that, huh? Definitely this evening, I promise. It's all your fault. Why is it my fault? You wear three sets of clothes every day, while I wear one. It isn't my fault but yours that the washing machine is broken. Are you even listening to yourself? I'm just telling the truth. Do you not agree with me? No, it's fine. - Divorce. - What did you just say? Nope, nothing. I'm kidding. You think it's funny? Divorce is something to joke about? Sorry. I'm so sorry. Excuse me, sir! NO JUNK MAIL Can't you read that sign? If you don't want it, just throw it away. Don't be such an old shrew! "Old shrew"? You're calling me an "old shrew"? Do you want me to sue you for defamation? Where do you work? You'd better believe I'll go there and tell them to fire you! Well, do it! They paid me to deliver these leaflets to houses like yours. - Sue me if you want! - Don't tempt me! Stop it, honey! Don't make a fuss! Do you want the whole neighborhood to know? Damn it, old man! Watch your woman! Don't let her be such an ass! What? Who did you call "old man"? You see? He insulted us. Did you hear it? - Hey! Let go of me! - Enough! Stop it! I won't let you get away next time! You hear me? Remember this sign! I don't know why you never defend me! Am I not your wife? Damn it! I never get a moment of peace. Why did she turn into a completely different person after marriage? Maybe I'm not ready to settle down. You always piss me off! Can't you see I'm using the toilet? Is there any spot on your body that I haven't seen, huh? Quick! Do you know that you're super cute when you're like this? Hi, honey. Don't forget to fix the kitchen light, honey. Alright, honey. What's wrong, honey? The toilet won't flush. Have a look at it tonight, honey. Yes, will do. What else is broken, honey? Nothing. But you forgot to kiss me goodbye this morning. I'm sorry. I'm doing it now. Let me hang up first. OK. On my count to three, alright? One... Damn! I have to divorce! This is the most important project for us this year. That's why the big boss expects a lot from it. Whoever is in charge of this project will get a big bonus and a promotion. There's one problem, though. It's a bit too quiet in here. - I'll go, sir! - I'll go, sir! I just need one of you. So I choose... Quan. Sir! Please, sir! I just divorced, sir. I've lost everything! I'm too upset now. Please think again, sir. Why are you crying? You're a man! You know nothing, alright? Do you know my kid chose to live with my ex-wife? Can you just let me have this one? I'm constantly depressed. Sir, my wife is a nightmare. Let me tell you, sir. I'm constantly being tortured mentally. She forces me to eat in the middle of the night, while I'm using the toilet, and even when we're doing it! Sir, I'm a victim of mental abuse. God! Also, she talks a lot. She follows me all day and talks. Do you understand? All day! And she asks me a thousand questions, driving me crazy! After I've answered a thousand questions, she follows up with a million more! She just drives me crazy! I can't take another second of it! Sir, how about you let both of us do it? Two is better than one, right? Please, sir! Please! No! Only one of you is going. You two sort it out! Sir! I'm begging you! I'll have to be there for a year. I begged my boss not to send me... but he didn't agree. They need me there. I'll visit you once a week. I think once a month is alright, honey. How sacrificing your family for your career could be alright? Are you really going to leave me alone here? I'm doing this for us. Don't they say, "Men make houses, women make homes"? I'm putting in the hard work now, so I'll have more time with you and our kids. Oh, God! Fire! Put it out! Fire! Quick, honey! Put it out! Continue, honey. I think... we have to get out of here first. Huh? Consider this your dessert, OK? I.. don't like dessert. Main course it is. I'm full. Can I go with you? No, you can't. I don't want to be alone, you know. Alright! This is me making up to you for a month in advance. A month? A year. What? Sleeping with your wife is just making up for you? Dung! I made it up to her until the early morning. She eventually forgave me. I'm finally free! BAO LOC CITY And this song has brought us to the end of our talk show today. If you have a story to share, please drop us an email. Have a good evening, everyone. Good bye and see you again. Hey, please don't yawn in the studio. I'm just tired waiting for emails and comments coming in. How many? - Four. - Uh-uh. All of them are bad reviews. I think we should stop doing this. Is marriage that boring? You don't know what it's like. Obviously. I think my life is pretty good. Though I do feel lonely sometimes. Lonely is good. Single is good. You hear me? You're a married man, you wouldn't understand. Single. Peaceful. That's the way life should be. Honey, open the door! Honey! I just want to see you one last time! Go away. - Honey! - We're done. What are you looking at? Get lost! Surprise! Go take a shower. Dinner is ready. Just one day apart and I've missed you so much. You must be feeling the same. So I've come to surprise you. Are you happy? Did you have to bring them with you? Don't tell me... you're planning to stay? Of course I'm staying! I don't want to, but I'm doing it for you. I'll consider this as our second honeymoon. What about our house? Who's going to look after it? We can't just leave it like that! A house needs laughter, needs you, and needs me. That's what's important. You're spilling food again! Do you know how annoying it is? Where are you going? My tummy hurts. I'm going to the bathroom. - Where are you going? - I'm going with you. I can't take it anymore! Get out of my house! You're not leaving? You love eating, right? Eat this! Eat! Here! Eat them all! What are you afraid of? Just eat! Are you alright? Hey! What the hell are you doing? It's none of your business! Help! Someone, please help! He's attempting suicide! Help! What I do... whatever I do is none of your business! If your suicide attempt succeeds, your spirit will be trapped here. As it lingers on, people will come asking for lucky numbers, disrupting the neighborhood. How is it none of my business? Are you insane? If you want to die, do it somewhere else. Don't die here and cause us trouble, OK? What's wrong, honey? This loony was attempting suicide but I stopped him. Who did you just call a loony? The one who just attempted suicide. You! Stop it, honey. Let's go home! Come on! Let's go. Exercising shouldn't be this much trouble! Get to know your colleagues, OK? Everyone must have a date for tonight. If you don't already have one... now is your time, alright? Yes, sir. Good. I already told my boss you were sick. I know how much you hate these things. I'm going with you tonight. It's true, I hate those company parties where wives pretend to be cool. However, since your boss knows that I'm here, it's only right that I go say hi to him, don't you think? God! Can't you even do something as simple as washing the dishes? I'm sorry, sir. My wife wanted to come, - but at the last minute she had... - Honey! ...an accident. You... Is this your wife, Quan? She's beautiful. I apologize for being late. Don't worry, it's good that you can make it. You should have stayed home and rested. I'm fine. I'm not here to intimidate the wives of my husband's subordinates. You don't have to treat me like a queen. So you have nothing to worry about. Do I look worried to you? We often meet to trade cooking and baking recipes and tips. - Do you want to join... - I don't have to. I myself am very good at cooking. So good my husband gained weight and had to beg me to make it less delicious. What do you do now? I'm a writer. And if you want to ask me if I've published something, the answer is any day now. Any day now. It's any day. What do you do in your free time? I'm never free. And I don't like doing anything. You naughty children! Where are your parents? Oh my, what's the matter now? Calm down, honey. Your wife is good at everything. Great, even. Too bad she has no manners. Manners and keeping my mouth shut are two different things. Why do I have to keep silent when I'm frustrated? The person who made others uncomfortable and kept silent instead of apologizing is the one without manners. I'm so sorry. As an only child, she can be bratty. Hope you understand. What? You mean I have no manners? Who here is an only child, please raise your hand! See? Do you mean that everyone who raised their hands has no manners? Come on! Let's go home! I'm not going home! I'm not wrong! Don't make me! Tuan! I have to divorce. Can't believe she followed me here! She's persistent, I'll give you that. Hang in there. And calm down. Give me some time to think it over. We have to concoct a plan. You're home! Go change. We're having beef and celery stir-fry for dinner. First, make her hate you. Stop doing what you have been doing. I'm not having beef stir-fry and I'm not going to get changed. A woman wants to end the relationship when she suspects an affair. Hey. It's me, honey. OK, got it. Let's meet at the usual place. Whose are these? Huh? It's not yours? It's not mine. It must belong to another woman. - Hey! - You knew about it? What did you say? I said I didn't want to eat beef stir-fry. Honey, are you sick? No... I'm not. Then sit down and have dinner! Right now! Eat! Quick! ATTEMPT NUMBER ONE: FAILED You seem to have developed the habit of talking to yourself. ATTEMPT NUMBER TWO: FAILED Be more careful the next time you take clothes off the clothesline. Do not take our neighbor's clothes. And underwear of all things? Gross! Honey, why don't you think I am having an affair? I'm a man, you know. And men have love affairs all the time. Do you dare? Tell me? ATTEMPT NUMBER THREE: FAILED I'm all out of moves. I'm scared that she castrates me before I've got a chance to divorce her. What? My last chance is to make her fall in love with someone else? He has the reputation of being a lady-killer. From young girls to married women, they all fall head over heels for him like they are under his spell. I took a four-hour flight to come here. - You told me I'm the one! - He's mine. Back off! Enough! When will you get it? I don't belong to anyone. How many more times do I have to tell you? I don't even know what love is. Go! Leave! I divorced for you! You're not the only one! Who are you to slap him? Let go of him! He's mine! Leave me alone! - Let go of him! - He's mine! PLEASE CALL ME, I NEED YOUR HELP! 0122338115 I heard that you're a lady-killer. I'm just interested in women... not men. No, that's not what I mean. I have a favor to ask. I really need your help. Help with what? And why would I help you? Please, I'm begging you. Only you can help me. I need you to seduce my wife. Can you do it? Are you insane? What are you up to? Or are you setting me up? No, I'm serious. I need you to seduce my wife. Psycho! I really can't live with her anymore! Hey! If you don't help me, I'll kill myself right here right now. Only you and I have been here. The police will come for you. Do it! Are you sure? You're not bluffing, are you? That knife won't kill you. Try this one. So? Do you have the guts? No? Please, I'm begging you. You don't know what she's like. I really need your help. I'm begging you! I can't stand her anymore. Oh, right! I'll pay you. I have 300 million dong in my savings account. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Stand up. Actually... I only have 100 million Dong. Can you give me a discount? Here's how it goes. Either you keep that money and get back to your wife. Or you transfer all of it to me in exchange for your freedom. Take some time to think it over, eh? Hey! Are you confident? Hey! Let's do this! Don't ever get involved with that psychopath, OK? What are you having? Up to you. What would you like to drink? - Sir? - Two sweet coffees, please. Alright. Do you believe in destiny? Why aren't you making any progress? This is a special case. I need more time and the rest of our deal. I've sent you half! You'll get the rest when you finish the job. - All or nothing. - What? Are you for real? It's a small price to pay for your freedom. How long is this going to take? Just send me the money, alright? Then, Khuong told me to get my wife a job so he could make his move. - Hello? - Hello. ‎What does she like to do? She's always wanted to be a writer. Has she published any books? No. "It isn't on paper yet," she said. Think it over. Does she have any talents? Or a specialty, maybe? Talent, huh? She does have one. She talks a lot. She's like, all mouth, you know? - Really? - You know that! ‎She's like a radio, right? Thank you. A guest? Quan told me to come here to drop off a gift for you. He mentioned nothing about being a guest. Also, I'm not a celebrity. Last week, our guest wasn't a celebrity, either. He was a middle-aged man who talked about his life experiences. Right... right? Exactly! That episode was a hit. We got so many positive reviews from our audience. Yes. I don't work. I'm a housewife leading a very boring life. That boring life is exactly what we need right now. The audience always says that our show is boring and we should stop doing it. What I mean is... a person who considers herself boring is something new and interesting for our audience. - Right? - Yes. Definitely! If that's the case, I won't be needing your script. I'll just say whatever comes to my mind. Ah, I've been writing. I'll read some of my work to the audience. Is that alright? - Yes, of course! - Yes, absolutely! I won't be giving any bullshit advice. - Great! - OK! And I want to get paid. No way! That's too much. But she said she wouldn't do it otherwise! OK, fine. Double it is. Dear listeners, let's start today with our first segment, "The Ugly Truth," with our special guest for the day, Miss Candid Candace. Hello, how are you doing? Actually, I'm sick. Can you elaborate? I'm sick of people around me pretending that they're fine, they're good, they're alright. But... in fact, they are not. I need you to tell me as much as you can about your wife. RE: PLAN TO SEDUCE MY WIFE NOTES: LOVES ANIMALS, COOKING LOVES TRAVELING, EXOTIC PORCELAIN Hey! Let go of me! You're not getting away with this! Has a bad temper. You naughty children! Hates children. Stubborn. Unsympathetic. Hates noise. Hates people who talk a lot. Hates leftovers. Hates everything! I've sent you all the things you need to know about my wife. I hate those who believe in destiny, in fortune telling, in horoscopes and make them an excuse to whine. That's just bull! - Yes! - Absolutely! And I also hate those events that my husband's company throw where the wives gather and suck up to the boss' wife like a flock of sheep. So true! Which raises the question, why do you have to suppress your feelings? Say "no" when you don't like it. - Don't be scared of being different. - Yes! I think trying to be strong or playing it cool when you're not is just pretentious. We don't have to be cool around them, or even like those boring jerks. We have to think about ourselves, not trying to make everyone in the world happy. Such a bitter woman! I actually agree with her. I feel sorry for whoever her husband is. ...that you had to endure someone or something? We all have feelings and it's up to us to let people know how we feel. You can't control whether someone likes or dislikes you. You'll feel bad if you care too much about it. I don't care and frankly, I don't have time for that. And even if I had time, I'd spend it doing something else. Why? Because that's what I like. What an interesting woman! My wife loves exotic porcelain. Excuse me! What are you doing? Are you throwing those away? But they look new! You're being a real pain. Now I have to ask for your permission when taking out the trash? This is not trash. These are brand new. Why do you want to throw them away? It's trash to me, alright? Please, don't throw them away! Don't waste such good porcelain. Don't you see these are exotic? Do you like porcelain? Why do you have so many cool things when you live alone? My ex-girlfriend loved collecting porcelain. I always bought her some when I came back from my trips. Now, they just make me sad. A hopeless romantic and a lady-killer. A man can date many women, but he only loves one. Add a slice of apple. It'll taste better. Quite good. If you love porcelain so much, I guess you're a good cook? Has anyone ever told you that you have a beautiful smile? No one needs to. I'm well aware. Don't you work? I rarely see you leaving the house. I'm a stockbroker. - Well... can I ask you something? - Uh-uh. I don't know anyone around here, so maybe we can talk some time? You mean you'll give me porcelain every time we talk? Take anything you like. Maybe I'm something you like... Don't be so sure of yourself. What if I like you? I'm married. I'm just kidding. I just enjoy talking to you. You have quite an interesting point of view. Oh, I know this place. I have a feeling that it will help you with your show. Did you just buy those? The man next door gave them to me. I thought you wanted nothing to do with that psychopath? Actually, he's not that bad. Maybe I was wrong for judging him. YOU'LL HAVE YOUR FREEDOM SOON. I'm quite baffled by recent events on social media. And why is that? Because people are spending too much of their time and energy on the so-called "weird social media fads." There's nothing wrong with wanting a rich, successful man, or an attractive and brilliant woman. There are over seven billion people on Earth, each with different view, and unique desires. You can't judge a book by its cover. We make this world a better place by being different. Wouldn't we be boring, dull clones if we all thought the same? Dung seemed to be full of life after getting that job. I felt like she was the old Dung I had fallen in love with. I love this place, they have a lot of books. Let me see one of your favorites. - Hey. - Huh? Will you go somewhere with me? I think it will help you with your job. I'll have to think about it. Hello? Will you be home for dinner? You won't? OK, it's fine. Love you. I'll hang up first. Three, two. TEXT MESSAGE FROM KHUONG: HAVE YOU CONSIDERED MY OFFER? LET'S DO IT. Don't be shy, or you'll scare them away. They're actually very friendly. TEXT MESSAGE FROM KHUONG STEP ONE: SUCCESSFUL. It's been so long I haven't felt this way. He seems to understand and sees me for who I am. Can it be... We all want money but we ultimately fall for the soul. The other person isn't to blame. Neither is love. It all falls on lies and betrayal. Have you ever considered cheating on your husband... with someone else? What do you think would happen if my husband heard me say yes on the radio? It would be devastating enough to hear it from me, let alone with a bunch of strangers over the radio, am I right? Hey, let's go celebrate. My treat. We received tons of comments today. - Really? - Yes! You have no idea how popular we are these days! Half of those comments are negative. What's there to celebrate? Quiet! Let's do this, shall we? I'm sorry, today's no good. Maybe next time, OK? Hey, I'm free. You're free? Find something to keep you busy, OK? Where are we going? I don't think it's still open at this hour. Let's not go through the main gate, then. - Follow me. - What are you up to? Just get on first. Let me help you. - Wait here, OK? - OK. It's beautiful! "I've let you stay in my heart." "Let me open your heart and bring love back into your life." What's that? It's a French poem. Don't tell me that you think... I'll be right back. What are the chances? You're taking a walk as well? Be straight with me, OK? Are you following us? What if she finds out? From now on, I forbid you to ask her what she's been doing. I forbid you to text me or to follow me. Are we clear? As the plan was about to work, I was beginning to question it. What if I had been wrong all along? Why didn't you wait there? I want to go home. Where have you been? We had to prepare for our show tomorrow. Why haven't you cleaned the house? Look how dirty it is! You came home early, why didn't you help me with it? And look at what you're wearing! What's with the dark red lipstick? You've never worn make-up like that! This is different. I've got to meet people at work. Why isn't dinner ready? I'm starving! You're starving? I thought you would be home late as usual. What's wrong? Lately, I've been thinking about when we first met. We're going through a hard time. Do you still love me? Don't answer it. Hello, Nam. Really? This isn't a joke, right? What? They want you to work in the city? It's the government's radio station, honey. Can you not go? How can I not? It's a once in a lifetime opportunity. I'd be crazy not to take it. But we're married. We shouldn't live apart. Can you ask your boss if you can relocate? Just like how I followed you here. You can't say that, it's different. You're being selfish! Your job is important, and mine isn't? I've made my decision. I'm moving to the city whether you like it or not. Dung! Hey! You don't have to seduce my wife anymore. We're done here. I'll transfer the rest to you. No. My work is not done. It should be fine. I don't want to waste your time. Changed your mind? No... I didn't. I have one rule. I always finish what I start. I'm finally free! If you're being harassed or know someone who is, you have to speak up and stand up against it! Hello, we're doing "The Ugly Truth" segment for our show. What are you doing? Where did you come from? I'm here to speak for those who can't. You'll be the first speaker of our show. Are you ready? I don't know who you are! Get out! It doesn't matter who I am or if you're not ready. What's important is that your students don't want to be groped! What's your comment on being accused of sexual misconduct? Security! Please remove this crazy woman from the premises! - What's your comment? - Security! Kick her out! - Answer me! - I don't know anything! I don't know! It's these perverts who should be scared, not you. They definitely should be! There's no way... Quan! I love your wife's segment on the talk show. So do I. She's become very popular. I just love her segment. Why do people love her segment so much? It's not that good. I have to disagree. Alright. Get back to work! TEXT MESSAGE TO DUNG: YOUR SHOW TODAY WAS REALLY GOOD! HONEY CALLING Whose car is that? Did you drive here by yourself? Do you know how dangerous that is? I've just bought this. It's the best affordable there is. You bought it? Why did you make such a decision by yourself? Shouldn't I get a say in this? I've bought some food. I can buy it myself. It's been a long time since I drove a car. It's a strange feeling. I've been feeling... strange around you these days. - Let's go inside. - I can't. I'll be late for my show. Honey... It's late. I don't want you to be on the road. Goodbye, honey. Be careful, honey! Honey, you're clumsy and you don't know how to take care of yourself. What would you do without me? I have been thinking about us having a kid. The three of us would have dinner together and then watch a movie later. We would do everything together. TEXT MESSAGE FROM KHUONG: SUCCESS IS NEAR. Not going to invite me in? When I'm with you, I feel like I'm the happiest man alive. Everything feels like a dream. I can't tell what's real and what's not. What time is it? It's 10:55 p.m.. Every night at 10:55 p.m., remember that I'm with you. Goodnight. Are you trying to kill me? Yes, I am. Please stop! Stop it! I don't want to lose my wife. Dung has changed. She's back to her old self. Your wife is stunning and I want to pursue her. I won't let you! You have no right to say that to me. It's you who hired me to seduce her. She's my wife. I will sue you! Sue me? Tell you what? Go ahead. But remember to put down your name as the one who hired me in the papers. Where are we going? I have a surprise for you. Foot up. Another step. Are you scared? It's confetti. What's wrong? I had no idea a strong woman like you would be scared of this. Come on. Your fans are waiting for you. Why have I allowed myself to have these awful thoughts? What would Quan think if he found out? Please leave a message after the tone. The number you have dialed cannot be... Damn it! What the hell is he up to? This is a scammer who is very good at deceiving and scamming gullible women. According to a reliable source, he has just resurfaced after disappearing for a while. Today, we will expose him. This is our 27th episode. Your personal information and your voice will be kept... Shall we? You tell women that you love them but it's not true. I've never told any woman I loved her. - You make them fall in love with you and... - I already told you. A man may like a lot of women but there's only one whom he loves most. They said that she talked too much. That she always complained and she hated everything. But me, I love the sounds she made and her complaints inspire me. I know. I don't deserve it. But I always hope she will give me a chance. TRANG CALLING Hello? How is it going? Have you exposed him yet? It's true he was born to be a lady-killer! Where's my wife? Is she mad? Does she want to kill him? What did you say? Crying? My wife is crying? Don't air this episode, please. Why? Hey! Hey! Break it up, you two! Why did you make her cry? Huh? - Let go of me! - Break it up! What are you doing? Why is your suitcase here? - I came to say goodbye. - What? Is it because of him? Who? How do you know? It's not important. Forget that asshole! You're falling for him, aren't you? Everything is a lie! It's me. I hired him to seduce you! He's a scammer, a scoundrel, an asshole! What are you talking about? You hired him to seduce me? Are you that sick of me? No, it's not that. I was just finding a way to improve our relationship. That's enough. I'm sorry, Dung. It's all my fault. I wasn't thinking. You're right though! I was falling for him! He knew everything about me. He supported me and encouraged me. He didn't tell me I was annoying! How about you? You are my husband, but have you ever listened to me? He just wants to seduce you! Everything he knows about you came from me! Look at the husband I've loved all these years. You hired someone to seduce your wife. Look at yourself, Quan. How did you turn into this kind of person? Did you tell him about my fear of explosions? I can't believe you told him that! You didn't know my father caused my mother's death, did you? What? - Hey. - What? Can you take a look at the gas lines? I think there's a leak. I've turned it off but there's still a smell. Stop complaining! I don't smell anything. If it's a gas leak, it's very dangerous! Then take care of it! How can you take care of your family when you can't even take care of the kitchen? Such a nag. Let's go. God! That house is on fire! Fire! Fire! I told myself that I would never become a vulnerable woman who people can push around! You feel so suffocated with me? My husband can be stupid, and he can be incompetent. But he definitely can't be a coward! You can't even leave your wife! You had to trick me into having an affair! Take your hands off me! Just a day apart and I've missed you so much. You must be feeling the same. So I've come to surprise you. Are you happy? You're home! Go change. We're having beef and celery stir-fry for dinner. Do you know that you're super cute when you're like this? You should wear T-shirts and sweatpants to work. Save me so much trouble. I'm sick of having to do this every single day. On second thought, I can do anything because I love you. Hey! Can't you read? If you don't want it, throw it away. Hey, watch your tongue! OK, fine. I'll skip your house next time, OK? Jesus, chill, man. Hey. I've come to tell you that our court hearing is next week. How's your new place? You should be the one who gets the house. I don't like staying here anyway. The place with a lot of fond memories is the saddest place. The person you love most hurts you the most. Mr. Quan Tran and Mrs. Dung Hoang, please. I'm sorry, my wife isn't here yet. Why did you want to meet me here? I heard you and Quan were getting a divorce today. I regret everything I did. I know I may not deserve it, but... can you give me another chance? She's not here. She must be having second thoughts! She's definitely having second thoughts! I'm sorry, I'm late. Let's go in. We will resume after lunch break. Let's have lunch. My treat. - Why did you bring me here? - You remember this place? It's where we had our first date. - What are you having? - I'll have pumpkin soup, please. I'm sorry, we're out of pumpkin soup. I'll have smashed potato salad then. I'm sorry, we're out of that too. What do you have then? We still have everything else on the menu. But my wife wants these dishes. Honey, let's go. It's fine. I'll order something else. One creamy garlic butter pasta, please. I'll be right back. Thank you. What's gotten into you? It's just a meal. I'm scared that this will be the last time we share a meal. So I wanted you to have a good meal. You should learn to control your temper and be more considerate. This isn't a big deal, Quan. I'm sorry. I... I've been feeling so lonely. I went to work every day and you were stuck at home. - I'm so sorry, I didn't understand... - It's all over now. Did you realize that we've both changed? It's not that I've changed. It's just I've become my old self again. I still remember the first time we met. Are you OK? I'm here. Don't be scared. I've missed you so much! Mr. Quan Tran and Mrs. Dung Hoang, please. Do you believe in destiny? Mr. Quan Tran and Mrs. Dung Hoang, please. Because I do. Those who disagree with me, it's because they haven't found theirs yet. Mr. Hung Le and Mrs. My Nguyen, please. A happy home is a place filled with sound. It gives you the energy to live your life to the fullest. Remember, don't let your life stand still. Whether it is a blender, a washing machine, or a vacuum cleaner, just make some noise. Because well, silence is not golden.
