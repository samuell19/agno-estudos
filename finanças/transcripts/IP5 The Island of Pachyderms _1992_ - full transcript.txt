I'm the tagger with balls, coverin' the station walls. Counters and passenger cars. Platforms and bridge cross-bars. Bus shelters, shop fronts. Concrete where the tag man hunts. Any old thing's good for me. To get my name up front, y'see! With my aerosol I massacre every idol. I take those shitty ads of yours and cover them with my own applause Hieroglyphics with new attitude, put those demo banners in the mood. Even to the very grave, I leave flowers for the brave And on the graveyard stones I spray the rage within my bones In this world, left on the shelf I use the spray to express myself With the colored, painted scrawls I make love to city walls The top men are sent after me Their city cops by duty bound. But I've gone underground. Yes, I've gone underground I'll never let fear in, I'm free. Life is one big jungle, see. From the gloomy caveman days to the latest neon craze I'm nothing but a signature One big Failure! Fa-fa-fa-failure! Lure-lure-lure-lure Fa-fa-failure! Lure-lure-lure-lure! - Far out! Photo finish! Go stand over there. - Come on, move. - Okay, okay cool it. Ready? Super? What now? - We're gone. For Christ's sake! Sloshed again? I'm fuckin' sick of it! Hey Jockey, little Jojo, here you are... I can't open the door, they changed the lock. They fuckin' didn't! Let me see. Sorry, dad. It's okay son. It was only my head falling... - The bottle, Jojo. - Here it is, here. Thanks. Lift your feet, dad. - I love you, son. - I love you too, dad. - Jojo, you're a champ! - Yes... - A real champ. - Agreed. I said you're a champ. You promised to only drink fruit juice. Fuck. Jesus Christ! Son, shoe thieves! - No, dad, it's me. - Ah, it's you Jockey? - Jockey? - Yes, it's you! My son Jojo... - Gimme a hand, Dad. - We will swim? Yes! Jojo... - Lie down, dad. - Yeah, I'll lie down. - What's going on? - It's bath time. - My Jojo, we go swimming? - Yes. Yes, I'll go swimming with you. I like swimming... It's moving. - Jockey! My little Jojo! - Yes! - Jojo! - Oh... Jockey! Jojo! My son... Dad! Dad! Dad! Night nurse? Stop. You're a real social liability. Books... Should burn 'em all. Don't! - Don't... - OK. Let's make a deal. Seems those assholes love 'em in their gardens. Drive 'em to Grenoble and you get this back, shithead. No sweat. While you're away, I'll keep your drawin's dickhead! In any case, you got no choice. Remember your book. When do I leave? The wreck needs a check up. I'll call you. You leave Tuesday. - OK. - By the way, you go to Grenoble on your own. I don't want that chimp coming along, okay? Hey Tony. Lulu and Cannonball are after you. - I've noticed. - They worked you over! - Motherfuckers! - Got my radio alarm? - None left. - What? I got you this, look. Fucking Michelangelo? I wanted a radio! Hold on, we got a van of these. No one wants this shit. Give it to him, it's a great gift! So, how's your dad? - Pfft! The nurse is with him. That asshole's always sloshed! C'mon, it's nothing serious. - What's that? - Forget it. - What about my radio? - It's okay, Choucroune's on it. Come on! Hello. Hello. - Is it serious? - Of course it is. A coma is always serious. You needed an ambulance. Next time, get him to a hospital. He won't go to the hospital. He'll end up there if this goes on. I mean, usually it's okay. The night nurse comes and usually he's okay. - You're not the usual one. I'm a replacement but that doesn't change a thing. - I got you somethin'. - My radio! My radio alarm! - Somethin' better, close your eyes. It's a surprise. Attention! There. - Recognize it? - Where the fuck's my radio? There were none left. Fuck! - It's Michelangelo. - Was he some mafia guy? Are you really that dumb? Come on, Mickey, Michelangelo! - Michelangelo? - Yeah, a well known painter. I'd better pay you. Pardon. Hang on, it's only me! - They've got the safe. - It's only me, dad. - How much? - 350, night rate. - You don't know yet? - Have you got a pen? - Okay, I've got one. - Well, I got one too.. - 350... - It's okay, he's an expert. - Jockey, my son, where are you? - I'm coming Dad! Go get your cap, Jockey. - There. - Thanks. - Your pen. - Thanks. Jockey! My son Jojo! Got your cap? Here it is. - Give me your hand, son. - Here it is. Longchamp, 3000 meters. 20 starters, the goin' is good. Go for it, Jojo. - Okay, dad. - Yes. And they're off! Barraca has pulled out into the lead as usual. The runners are now comin' up to the first bend and they're close. Sour Herring, Muskrat, Bomber and Adman close together! Barraca still out in front! Will he manage to hold out? Down the bend, Scud, is on the inside with Super Mobs. Zorro 2, comin' up on the outside. He's just a neck behind, Scud! - Does he get the winners? - No, never. But the old man needs to dream. The son lulls the father to sleep. - Where to now? - I've got other calls. Do you want me to come? This neighborhood's kind of rough. Especially for a girl like you... He's out cold now. Hey Miss, how can we stop my old man doin' all this shit? Go back, Jojo, you'll catch cold. I ain't cold Tear it up. Fuck, what a babe! Coming... - Hello. - Hi, Emile. Please excuse us, Mr. Tony, for the disturbance last night. I slipped. Thank God, Jockey was there. - No problemo, Emile, it's OK. - Got the winners today? 4, 9, and 12. - Maybe a photo finish for 12. - You sure? Don't move. I'll be right back. Good old Jojo! - My last, you sure? - Chill out, I'll bring you back a truckload You'd better or no Grenoble. - Is there really snow there? - Don't worry son, with money you can find snow anywhere and dickheads in flash ski-suits as an extra. Bye, Mr. Tony. Let's go, Jojo. Have a good day. Hello, I'd need emergency. Yeah, it's real urgent! I'm calling cause my granny ate her tablets... yeah. The EMS told me to call you. The ambulance guy said to call to find out what pills they were. The prescription? I don't know. No, she ate the prescription, she ate everything. We need to find the nurse who gave her a jab last night. She must know what kind of tablets granny had. Hi, can I help you? It's okay, thanks. Hang on, I'm Tony. The pal of that black kid, Jockey. I saw you last night. I know you. - The coma. - Yes. Well, what a coincidence... Here you are. The alcoholic coma? Yes, that's it. I was just passing by and Yes, that's it. I was just passing by and You had my address? Did not! - Gloria, quick! Come! Gloria, where were you? I've been looking all over! - What's up? - The old woman last night ate her tablets. She tried to kill herself. What was she on? - We need to know. - What? How old? - I'm not sure how old - What kind of pills... The old woman is my grandma. I just wanted to get your address - You gave my address to him? - You should have heard what he told me. Oh, great! What you just did is the kind of thing I hate! Get in your macho car and piss off!

It's that nurse, right? That chick sure got to you! Yeah, I think this is love at first sight. You think love calls? I don't know. You should write her a love letter. Yes. Sure, I'll write her a letter. - You don't know how to write. - Something big. Smells like trouble to me, Tony. Wow look! Fuckin' hell! Isn't that great? The butcher says it's an ad. It's pretty wild. Maybe that's what they call competitive advertising. It's beautiful. Nice, huh? Brightens up the place. - It's pathetic. - Well, I like it. - Pathetic. - Well there you go. I'm not surprised you like it. I'll just have to move now. No problem. I'll follow and do the wall opposite. - I'd do the Eiffel Tower for you. - Sure.

Will you tell me how we find her? - No, I won't. - You'll see. - Okay... What's got into you? I got pizza and the car-owner got a headbutt! We've been walking a fucking hour. There's no cars anywhere. You wreck everything. You ain't got the touch. See what you did to the BMW? You're hamfisted. Cool it. Three in the morning is the best time to hitch, I can tell. Listen. Wheels... A case. A Renault... 20. Wow, a direct hit, Jesus Christ! A direct hit! What's he doing? What the hell. - Fucking bastard! - Don't move. You're a beauty! - Shhh...

Well my guess is it's alive. Well, make up your mind, is it dead or not? Is it dead or not? Where did that old fart come from? What are you doing? What about you? You weren't here earlier. It was a soldier, an artillery officer even. He lent it to us for the weekend, that clear it up? Okay, man get out. - It's cold... - Fuck that! Out! C'mon, move it! Get the fuck out, I said!

Yes, yes, yes it's possible... Yes, I'm sure of it. In any case, we're not far off. - I can tell... I can tell! - You what? Silence! I'm not moving. It hurts. I'm staying - Where's the pain? - My ankle hurts, my back hurts... Okay, just lie down here.. - Lie down. - Here? Yes, lie down. Take off your shoes. And your socks. Pull your shirt up. - What's he doing? - He looks like he's concentrating. No soul. Nothing! What? No soul. Empty shell. What did he say? I swear it wasn't me! He said, "empty shell." Ahhh. Slight sprain. Hey... that hurts. That's nothing, that's nothing. The worst is elsewhere. What's the worst? - Fuck, the rabbit! It's not dead. - Oh, far out! - Fuck look I'm fine! - Like the rabbit! It's here, I'm sure it's here. It's here, I'm sure it's here. I think it's more that way. Ah this is it! This is it! Oh yes... Oh yes! I'm going for a dip. Aren't you coming? He's a maniac! It would do you good, kid. It would calm you down a bit. Is he Jesus or what? Okay, let's clean him out. - A gold sheet. - Not everything. A comb. A map. A knife. A towel. A thermos. A first aid kit. - Faster, no cash? - Hang on! Goddamn mess! Got the dough! Leave him some. - Fuck, look out! - And the rest? Give it here. Oh shit, shit! This isn't the place. It was deeper. It was deeper. - This isn't it. Where was it? - Towel. - Here you are, sir. - Thanks, son. I thought... Here. What are you looking for? Something deeper. With tall pine trees. I'll find it. You see the stars? - It's broad daylight. - Ah... I can hear them. And? They talk to me. What do the stars say? They say you're thieves and liars. So... Can't you see anything? Can't you hear anything? All of this, all of it... it's got a name right? - It's not a film set! - Do you know? I know she's in Toulouse. This guy switches on and off... and blows on the leaves! I don't care... The opposite would have been more surprising. You don't care. I'd have been surprised otherwise. Ah, I'll get it back, huh! If you believe that... It is serious, isn't it. Oh! La, la! But I'll find it! I'll find it. Beheho! Two hundred... three hundred... four hundred... Shit! Four hundred... four hundred francs! Four hundred francs. I want to know where Robin Hood - was going with his Luger? - His what? His Luger. A German piece. Didn't you see it in the parka? Why didn't you shoot him? I'd have shot him alright. Look! Do you think he's a psycho? All I think about is wheels. Roads - Mean wheels? - There you are. Let a pro do it. What the hell are you up to? With Japanese cars, you need Zen. It's tough! These Japs aren't easy. - Move it, someone's gonna spot us. - Shh! - Want a hand? - No, I'm okay. - Sure? - Yea. Change the blade. That one's too small to do it. A real ace car thief! Hey, kids! Studying for the locksmiths' exam? - We lost the keys. - Lost the keys, did you, short-ass? We'll give you a hand. We've got all the keys we need. Loads of them. A trunk full of keys. We... we want just to open it. Our granny lost the keys. I know your granny. - I've seen her on her bike. - She wins races sometimes! Well, granny's not here but grand dad is! They can go and play pinball, officer... but helping old people is another kettle of fish. Next time, I'll let the officers take you in. I'm sorry, gentlemen. Thanks. Marcel, there's something I didn't get. What about you? I'm with you on that, Marcel. - Thank you. - Oh, thank you very much. You slept well? - Yes, very well. - Good. - Have a good day. - Good bye. I'd gladly buy you a meal, but I don't know where my money is. You get forgetful at my age. Excuse me, natural calls. - That's twice he's saved us. - Alps or Pyrenees, I don't care. - I just want some snow. - He knows we've got his cash. Maybe the Pyrenees are best first. It's near Toulouse. Give me a break. Can't you talk about anything else? Sure horse races, I've got the numbers in my head. - Where are you going? - To get a racing paper. Give me the old guy's bag first. Look what I bought. - I've started drawing. Look. - Yeah, not bad. Is it a dog? It's a horse. Number 12, the winner. Not bad. I'll try oils later. Start off modest. You know what? The old guy's from a nuthouse. - He escaped. - He's a maniac? - Yes, he's on the run. - You sure? I saw it in his papers. Lie him down on the couch. Look! - Careful. - Thanks. - A doctor? - Where? Yvette, ask in the restaurant. - Are you okay? - Barman, a glass of water! My tablets. Pills. I found a doctor. What's happened here then? He felt ill. Here are his pills. Alright. Well, let's have a look. Very good. - Have you already had a coronary? - Yes... This is serious. He has to take them everyday? He's already had a coronary. He shouldn't be on the road. - Have a car? - Mercedes 300 class S. - Oh! Is it automatic? - Yes, why? - You like German cars? - You bet. No, we don't like German cars. Say goodbye, the doctor's busy. - Goodbye, doctor. - Thanks, doctor. - Don't you ever lay off? - Fuck, a class S! You haven't had enough? - Cool it. - Fuck, a class S! - Where is he? - The older gentleman? He went off through the garden. Towards the forest there. What's up? I'm not going! What do you mean? I came for the mountains and snow. The old guy's fighting fit. What if he dies in there? Let him! Get another old man. That's what you get. Are you crazy? First the nurse, now that old guy. The old fart saved us. You sure he didn't save you from madness? I'm not a Samaritan, keep your fucking Rainman. What are you? A racing driver, a painter? Racing driver and athlete! You piss me off! Fuck off. A painter, a major painter! Like Michelangelo... like Michelangelo... Are you scared of the rain? This rain can't hurt you. - This is lustral rain. - It's what? Rain that purifies. You were right to stand in it. Otherwise, you could go to hell. You shouldn't stay here, you're already ill. That's a load of rubbish. They know nothing! I know what's wrong. It's nothing! Nothing's wrong. Here. - Sure you're okay? - I'm fine. Tell me, how do you feel after that? The forest, the rain... Well, then... Thanks. - I have to go. - Where to? Toulouse? The main road's just there, straight ahead. Beheho! Beheho! - Ah! That does the power of good! No one dares shout any more these days. Beheho! Well? Where is it now? Yes... Tony! Beheho! Tony! Tony! Tony! I'm sick of this forest. Tony! Beheho! Ah! Tony! Tony! - Did you hear that? - Yes, it's Jockey. He's been behind all this time. Come. - Where is he? - Over there. - Tony! - Ah yes! Tony! Tony! Tony... Tony... Shit! He, he! Hey, Jojo, my man, are you lost? Get away from me, just get lost. C'mon, cool it! What's up? A tough street kid like you, scared of the woods? It's all the same thing, trees, grass, leaves... This jungle of your's stinks. It stinks! I want to go back to Paris! Forget it, Tony. Just forget it! This old fart's taking us for a ride. What about Toulouse and your chick? You had the hots for her? - What's he after exactly? - Pachyderm Island. Pachyderm Island? What's on the island? Treasure? Ah, no... You've come this far for a deserted island? - Heh... yes. - Just happens to have a Luger on him? It's for guys like you at night, in the forest, or on the road. There are strange people about. - Sure, but a Luger... - It's broken! But there are three bullets in it. He shoots at birdies? You poor fool! If only they could hear you... Birds are the temple guardians. I put my hand on the branch from which the bird just flew off, and I feel a bond with him. You understand? Here, come and see this. You walk through the forest like in a shopping mall. Because... In fact, the foot of a tree, is its head. It's an upturned being. The branches are its roots. They dig into the sky. They're up there looking for wind and sun. Listen! Look, kid, put your head against the trunk. Don't be afraid. - Oh... - You too, Tony. Me? Yes, don't be afraid. You too! Look! Go on, Tony, it's okay. Put your head against the trunk. - Oh! La, la! Plants contain the whole memory of the universe. You're part of that universe. Put your arms around the tree. Can you feel it? Ah! Beheho! Beheho! - Here we are. It's behind the rocks. - The road? - The island first. - Screw your fucking island. We're almost there now. You've been saying that for hours! Where the fuck is it now? - It is, Tony, honestly. - Go on then, go and see! We'll wait back here. Go on! - We'll wait right? - Yes. Go on! Go on! Is this real, this island business? - What's up? - I'm no kid. - We're here. - We've been here for hours! I can't name trees, but I know when I'm being fucked over. - Asphalt jungle. - This is it! What on earth do you think, you poor kid? Your scribbles on the walls. They're forests you're drawing. But they're there, behind your reptilian brain. - Rooted there. - Shut up! I'm fucking sick of hearing you! Reptilian brain... You're the reptile! - You want to hit me? - Pfft! - You think I hit old men? - That's a shame. You must regret it. If you keep on busting my balls, I'll make an exception, alright! Don't panic, kid... You'll get to Toulouse. What's it got to do with you? Keep out of my business! I'll find her anyway. Yes, you'll find her. - What the hell do you know? - I can see... What can you see? Always the same... she's right. I see a liar and a thief. Oh... I found the pool, Tony. Hurry up old man. Pachyderm Island. Come and see! Here it is! Oh yes! Yes! This is it! This is it, kids! Here it is... Look at that, kid. Look at it, it's wonderful! Look kid! Look... they're gods, real pachyderms! Come, caress them. Caress them! Look how nice it is. Look! Come on. Stroke them. Don't do that. It's cold Did you ever see penguins, on an ice-floe catch the flu? Don't act stupid, mister! You didn't headbutt him in the face, did you? I swear he tripped over a root. He fell over without me. He's pretty roughed up, huh? Oh... Oh, don't let me down. Don't let me down... I just want to see her again. Yes! Is he playing submarines? What the hell? For fuck's sake... That shithead can't swim! It's okay! Hang on! I can touch the bottom! Help me, now. Give me a hand... I don't understand. I don't understand I was sure this was the place. It was summer. I was on vacation down here. I was about your age. I'd left the village for the cool shade of the trees. And then I lost my way in the forest. I walked for hours on end. But then I had to accept the fact, I was well and truly lost. I felt like crying. All of a sudden, I heard laughter. I'd never heard laughter like it before. Like, crystal. It was music, it was the wind caressing the trees. I fell under the charm of it right away. When I reached the pool here, it was magical. The water was on fire and in the middle two nymphs with golden hair splashed about. The girls were laughing, diving, coming back up... and occasionally revealing their bodies, glistening with pearls of light. Women's bodies. Oh my God! My heart was leaping in my breast. From that day on, it has always beaten too quickly. I knew I'd never forget that sight, but I didn't know that the one I'd love forever was there. A twig snapped. They saw me. I was petrified. To my surprise, they beckoned me to join them. I couldn't swim. I still can't now. But I drowned that day for the first time. We met up again, Clarence and I. And we loved one another madly for the rest of that summer. Oh, we were so much in love! One day, the vacation came to an end. I had to leave after a fight and never saw her again. But I'm still looking for her. Didn't you write, or call her? Tony calls all the time. Gloria... What now? - Was the water good? - It's not what you think. It's not 'cause of your crap. Forget that, okay? Each time I think of her I get hard and so I go for a swim. - I knew that once. - Yeah, you knew it! Now, it's over, you don't need 'em. Fed 'em to the cat! - Don't panic, Tony. - I'm not panickin'. I'm not on the run from a nuthouse. - Come with me. - No, its okay. It's weird... Before, I ignored old people and now I'm here in the forest, looking at the sky, listening to your shit. Tomorrow, you'll go to Toulouse. You'll see her again. - Don't be like me. - I'll see her... There, on a branch with feathers on her head. Come on, you'll catch cold. Twelve, two... with a photo finish for number two. Seven, twelve... and for number two... No photo finish, because fourteen's going to win. Who said fourteen? I know someone said fourteen. Fucking nightmare. It was number two. And then some loudspeaker shouted "fourteen." It's fourteen. It'll be number two. - Fourteen. - Pfft... So, how's my acorn flour? Unusual. Kind of unusual, huh? I kind of think I've had enough. It's stodgy... Sure, but your thymus will soon feel the difference. I think I already can. - I threw up. - Of course. Your thymus is purifying itself. You need it, Tony. Ah... I must tell you something. It was number two! I'm stopping here. - I'm giving up. - Oh... No more swims and strolls in the woods? I'm going to the home tomorrow. It's all over. No, you can't. You can't, not now, it's too late, it's not the pool. You must find the woman. Where did she live? Did I say something dumb? Youhou! Waouh! Look, he bought me a bird. - Good huh? - Not bad. You're sure she lived here? I can't find her in the phone book. - Yahou! - It's like she didn't exist. She must have moved away. I didn't expect to find her. It's probably for the best. Maybe she married and changed names. Don't throw in the towel Me and Tony never give up. - I'd love a coke. - A coke, you know we have no cash. What's all this? Happy families? Shit, he's got the Gold one! Even the one to travel 1st class! - And I thought he was just a fool! - The joker's taking you to a hotel. Get my bag. You get his bag. - Pfft... Shit, always me! Shit! Hold on. I was having a rest. Nothing's change. - Except the aerials. - We'll find her. - Do you want to come downstairs? - Oh... me and weddings... The sun always shines when there's trouble brewing. What about the Luger? I threw it in the pool yesterday. Are you sure? - Do you think you can kill the past? - I don't know. I haven't seen enough. You'll see. I want that photo back. Straight on... then turn right... All the way down the hill and then left to the deli. OK, thanks, Monsieur. Goodbye! All right! What you're asking me is crazy. It would make him so happy, madame. Poor Clarence. What's she going to say? Nothing at all seeing as she's outside the village in the graveyard. He'll see I'm not her! They were splitting images, the two sisters. So alike, two twins! Monique, what have you got to lose? But taking Clarence's place, well... - It's not Christian. - Oh... What the hell... - Did you do that? - No. I pinched his glasses... Come on, he won't recognize you. - Not so fast! - Hurry up, he's waiting for us! - Look at this suit! It's free! - What do you mean? - Free as a bird, man. - The hell it is. Go and give it to him now you've got it. Free... Come in, it's open! What have you brought me, kid? Well I thought... Let's see. This didn't fall from the sky. Not too expensive, I hope? - Free... - Free! You're a crafty devil, Jockey. Look, I know how to do it too. Stealing is the easiest thing there is. The hardest thing is being as straight as a blade. You've got to give it back to the bride's father, with the letter I'll write him. Huh? Tell me, is she here? She's downstairs. You know, what you and Tony did is good. See we're not as rotten as you say. I didn't hear that. We're not as rotten as you say. What do I do with the suit? Take it back to where you found it. - Pfft... okay. Go on, be brave, kid. - Does it fit? - You've no idea. You look filthy. I changed. Take your netbon off. My what? Netbon. Monique = Niquemo, Jockey, Keyjo! Netbon = bonnet! What's wrong? It sucks. You could have let me go to the hairdresser's. - The earrings, get rid of them. - Oh! Go on. Really? Better? Monsieur, I hope you will forgive the theft of which you were the innocent victim of today. The seriousness of the gesture that I am about to commit at least requires that things be done correctly. One must walk to meet one's fate in full uniform. For this reason, I borrowed your uniform. Leon Marcel. He's here! - I'm scared. - You're like me! Each time I saw her, she threw me out. - Love's never been my strong point. - His neither. Can I kiss you? Of course. Stop your noise! Dickhead. The same old perfume. I thought you were far away. You wanted to travel. You couldn't keep still, always talking of journeys. I've been round the world several times. I traveled on cargo ships and ended up in import and export. - Are you rich? - No. No, I gambled it away. Mainly on horses. Did you get married? I found someone. I married Raymond. Six months after you went away. We met at the market, we got married. He bought a shop and we settled down. Any children? Yes, two. A boy and a girl. - And you? - Yes, me too. - Would you like a drink? - No thank you, I'm alright. It's working! This is the end for me. I've known for three months now. My family had me locked up in a mental home, waiting for the inheritance. Well, what's left of it! So... that's why.. I wanted to... see you again... Can you understand that? I hope you'll live a long time yet. You remember the pool? The nymphs pool... Where we went on vacation. I'm still looking for it. You remember that story? We used to laugh about it with Monique! We'd laugh because you believed us. You couldn't swim. We made you believe you just had to dive, where the woman you loved swam to avoid drowning. - I believed it. - Yes. I always believed it. And I still haven't learned to swim. He said he dumped it. Don't worry. Look. Happy families? I've been waiting forty years for this. 40 years since you told me... "I don't love you enough to go with you." My life has been a failure, Clarence. But you're not Clarence, Monique. She drowned herself. When? After that fight you had. Oh no... Oh no... Oh no... Old folks have got a freaky way of loving each other. We've been looking for you all over. What's up? I'm going back to the home. But there's no trains at this station. You never know. Come on, get in. Come on. We'll take you to Toulouse. - 2 seconds to get into it. - Better and better. - You'll have to call the owner. - What for? To apologize. Hi, lady, we just stole your car but don't worry we'll bring it back with a full tank, a radio and a cock-skin wheel cover. Bye, madame. Nice to have spoken to you! We've had it. These things take all day. You've time for a big breather. Yes. You should have seen him. The other day, he did a whole TGV, a world first. World Premiere! The Texans want to buy it. Take a good look. You've got plenty of time. Kid! Kid! Kid! - Oh! - I'm okay. - Shit... Kid! Kid! Oh... Fuck the bastard had it loaded! No. You came to shoot her! You keep your lectures! You took us for a nice ride. I'll kill you, you fucker. Let him go. The pills... Stay out of this. None left... - Let the fucker croak. - Hurry! Tony! Let him croak! Tony... Don't worry, we'll get you to the hospital. Tony, please. You think he'll pull through? - I don't know. The motel doctor said not. The jerk, they're all quacks. - He's in intensive care. - Can we go in? No visits in intensive care. It's serious. - Are you relatives? - He's my trainer. Know about horses? Horse races? Betting on beauty? - Quiet. - His heart? - It's complicated. - Should we stay here? - We'll call you. - It's no use staying. That's okay, we'll stay. So how are you? Better now? The doctor is coming. Great welcome. Good job with hot women to look at. See that? You're after a nurse. Well, this is where they come from. It's like looking for beer's Queen in Munich. You're in with a chance, see Gloria anywhere? Shut it! Well, did you find your princess? - Pfft... You're kidding. That bitch wouldn't help. There's four hundred nurses here. Five hospitals in the city plus clinics I'll never find her! Try small ads. Green graffiti man seeks nurse without panties. Shithead... I'll give you one. What's got into you? Fuck, you piss me off... You piss me off. What the hell did I say wrong? Shit. Cremation works out cheaper too. It's too dear otherwise. I'm not playing that game. All those miles to travel! They did it for Jean Gabin. The ashes were thrown over the sea. The Ministry of Culture paid. Tax-payer's money again. I'm no minister. The models of the boats in the attic, - can I have them? - Ask your father. Raymond? Know what? With just one, we could redo the bathroom. - The sailboat's beautiful. - And my housework? They're dust traps! Haven't you had enough? You stink the place out with glue! - At your age. - I just hope this is it this time. I hope he won't end up an invalid. I'm not taking care of him. And I'm not paying. I'd like to have the boat. It's beautiful. - Waouh! Number 14! - What? - Number 14 won! The Marcel family. - No, he wants the youngsters. - That's crazy! - We've been here hours. - Sorry, he refuses to see you. The old bastard keeps on doing it. He wants to humiliate us. What's that? That? That's a Pygmy! And that guy's Zantar... Tarzan! Leon found us in the forest. He adopted us. We're relatives now. We won't kiss but we're fond of you anyway. That's the last straw! Your friends, Mr Marcel. Ah... come over here. You look a bit pale, - especially you, Jockey. - No, we're 100 percent, dancing in the corridors. As long as the pixie dances, everything's fine! The little green pixie. That's good. No? Well... Thanks for the outing, kids, but it stops here. Come on, the nurse said you'd be out tomorrow. You have to take your pills and try to talk less, Mr. Marcel. 14 won. 14! Are the vultures here? You know, they love you. - Don't they, Tony? - Yeah, they're worried. Worried that I'll pull through, you mean. I won't go back to that home. Never! You won't go... What are you going to do? We're waiting for you. We're here. When you get out, we'll go and see the snow in the Pyrenees. That's enough, Mr. Marcel. Don't tire him. Goodbye. Tony, my son! Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. You'll pull through. You're the one who'll pull through. - Hi! - How are you? - Coming to the party? - No, we can't, we finish late. - Have fun anyway. - We're not missing much. - Your cousin asked about you. - My cousin? - I don't have a cousin. - That's what I thought. But he was cute so I didn't say. The black kid with him wanted to sleep here. They brought the coronary to intensive care. Keep an eye on him. That asshole Langlois's not hopeful. - Did you say anything? - To Langlois? - No, my cousin! - What could I have said? I'm used to my old man. They want to put him in a home. - Why don't we take him? - You don't get it. He threw his pills away, Jojo. That means he's sick of living. A guy who waits 40 years to kill a woman he loves just wants to die. He won't die. We'll see him again. The others want to burn him. They're shits. I'm tired of you thinking about her, - while he's alone. - Shit! I've had it. If he croaks, I'm back to Paris. Forget her. You fuck! Don't dump me here! You'll regret it all your life. I'm going to him. If he does die, he won't be alone. - They threw us out. - I don't care. Let them try to stop me. I'll wipe them out. Telephone! We never won. I mean... I just pretended for him. We never won a thing. No, we did once, by chance. My old man's convinced I'm a medium. I almost ended up believing it too. It's good for him. I choose any old number... Our phone number, the plates on green cars, Miss World's vital statistics... I even played his date of birth one day and he didn't notice. It's what keeps him going. He's got nothing else. Just the bottle and gambling. I've never had any luck with old folks. But you're different. I'll get you out of here. You won't go back to a home. I'm cold. Assholes! They left the window open. Your folks are rats! Mind dwarves. Don't cry, kid. I'm not crying. It's this dry air. You ain't got no fever. I'm hotter than you. I'm always all alone, see. All alone... I'm sick of playing the fool. Mom cleared off, dad's got a screw loose, and Tony'll run off with his chick and dump me like a jerk. Fuck, love's a piece of shit. That woman of yours, Clarence, would you have blown her away? - You can't understand. - You bet I can! When my mom took off, my old man threw our stuff out the window. He's been on 2 bottles of rum every day since. You think I can't understand? I wanted to go to the Pyrenees and see the snow. And the eagles, real ones flying in the sky. 'Cause of this Gloria, we're grounded here. If he doesn't find her he'll croak. You love Tony, right? - Like a brother. - That's good. One day, he'll do the TGV or the Concorde. His chick's wall the other day, well, he did the whole thing in one night. And she's so dumb, she told him to piss off. She didn't see he's a hero and that he loves her like crazy. - He'll find her again. - He better. Otherwise he'll end up like you with a candyfloss heart. He'll find her. Or he'll forget her. Why? Did you forget yours? Well, he won't either. Usually he goes with a chick and then dumps her, but this time it's heavy. He's in a bad way alright. If he really loves her, he'll find her again. Why did you find yours? I don't know... I didn't love her enough or too much. Or maybe I was too proud. Tony's a superman when it comes to pride. If she loves him, she'll come. You know, women aren't as stupid as us for this kind of thing. A life without love is a wasted life. You've no idea how much it hurts. You always think you'll catch up later... then one morning you wake up and you're dead. The green pixie's still dancing. Yes... He's dancing alone. My son... my son... Don't cry, kid. What's going on? Jesus. For fuck's sake, stop! You'll have another smash! Stop. - Open this door! - No. No way, we're off to see the snow. Screw you. He needs a fucking doctor! It's too late! Screw them all!
