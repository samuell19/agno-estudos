Why did you kill all the people in Zhaojia Village? Zilong, you went back to your hometown for your brother's funeral that year. Why don't you stay here and focus on your career this time? My parents died when I was a child. My brother and sister-in-law brought me up. They took care of me like my parents. Now, my brother has passed away and my sister-in-law lost her eyesight. I want to take care of her to repay what she did for me. Fine. It's rare to find such filial affection. Alas. Why are you so touchy-feely? A man should focus on his career. Zilong is determined. Yide, cut the crap. There is ample time ahead. Hope to see you again. Someday, he'll understand. No one can stay away from trouble in troubled times. XIAPI CITY Go! Retreat! It's been a few days since we tried to conquer the city. Everyone, do you have any good advice? Prime Minister, Xiapi City is so closely surrounded. It's just a matter of time for us to conquer it. However, Lu Bu is brave and wise. And the Red Hare he rides is capable of galloping across cities and leaping over moats. If he wants to break through the siege... I'm afraid nobody can stop him. Who is it? General. It's you. It's so late. Why don't you go to bed? The war is about to start. General, you'd better not drink. Xiapi City has been closely surrounded. I'm afraid we'll lose our last resting-place soon. I've experienced numerous battles. I don't think about life and death. But I'm sorry for what you've gone through. You've been leading a wandering life with me. General, why don't you break through? With your bravery and the Red Hare, you're unstoppable. If I can't even protect the woman I love, I'd be ashamed to live. General! Don't say another word. Trust me. Even if I have to die, I'll make sure you're safe. Prime Minister, Lu Bu's subordinate Zhang Liao is here with the Red Hare. Wants to give in. Let him in. I'm Zhao Liao. Allow me show my respect to you, Prime Minister. Is this the legendary Red Hare? Yes, exactly. Good! Great! I've heard you're loyal and righteous. Why do you want to surrender? Even a fine bird chooses a tree to nestle in. Lu Bu only cares about Diao Chan. He ignores our sincere advice and treats us like dirt. A good horse is not enough to show your sincerity. I'll do anything you say. Go back to Xiapi City right now and open the city gate when we launch an attack tomorrow. I'm willing to die the cruelest death for your sake, Prime Minister. Generals, take my order! Yes, Prime Minister! Prepare to launch another attack once dawn breaks! Got it! Even without the Red Hare, Lu Bu is still formidable and invincible. Everyone, do any of you want to defeat him and win the great honor? Well... Among all the generals, Xuande, I think only you and your two brothers can rival Lu Bu. That's easy. Just let the three of us go catch him! Yide. Good. Xuande, I look forward to your good news. Prime Minister, we'll try our best. Okay! The three of you can go prepare. Prime Minister, this is a wise plan, but what if Lu Bu folds his hands for capture? If he manages to break through the siege, all of them will be weakened. If he chooses to give in, he'll be of use to me. Zilong, you're back! Yeah. Uncle. - Zilong, you're back! - Yeah. I'm back. Zilong, you're back. What are you playing with? - Zilong is back! - Zilong. Zilong is back! - Zilong, - Zilong is back! Zilong, last time, you said you'd make me a wooden sword. When will it get done? I'll make one for you when I go hunting in the mountains next time. - I want one, too! - Go play! - Zilong, you're back! - Yeah. - Zilong, you're back! - Yep. Sister-in-law. I'm back. Zilong? Zilong, you're back. - Sister-in-law. - Zilong. You're back. Take a seat. Let me do it. You had a long journey. You must be tired. It's okay. It's just my horse who's tired. How was it going? I worried about you. I just visited some of my old friends. You don't need to worry. You don't need your spear when visiting friends, right? On his death bed, your brother said he hoped you could serve a wise leader and accomplish your goals so as not to waste your ability and skills. Please don't say another word. I just want to take care of you and live a quiet life. Then, I'll be satisfied. I'm healthy. You don't need to worry about me. A man should put his career first. I left for several days. I'll go chop firewood. Zilong! Go! My Lord, the Cao army has conquered the city. And the Red Hare is gone! Let's go. Kneel down! Why don't you kneel? Instead of a prime minister, you're actually a traitor. I don't need to kneel. You're a hero, but Diao Chan is just a weak woman. I'll serve you as long as you let Diao Chan go. Come on. Stand up, please. Great! With you, it'll be easier for me to conquer the world. You'll be in charge of the cavalry and I'll command the infantry. We'll be invincible. Prime Minister, haven't you seen what happened to Ding Jianyang and Dong Zhuo? You jerk! Take Lu Bu to the White Gate Tower and execute him. Prime Minister, I'm willing to serve you. Prime Minister... Prime Minister, please allow me to say goodbye to Lu Bu. General, you're an exceptionally mighty warrior. How can you bow and be despised by others? Even if you're going to die, die like a man. Don't worry. I'll be with you until the end. No!! Lu Bu was a nearly unchallenged warrior, but unexpectedly, he ended up like that. It'd be worse if he worked for Cao Cao. Uncle! Why did you kill all the people in Zhaojia Village? Madam, you're pregnant. Just leave such things to us. Recently, Xuande has been busy with government affairs. I need to collect some medicinal herbs that can soothe the nerves. You don't know those herbs, so I'd better do it myself. - But... - Madam! Someone is lying here in a coma. Let's go check it out. He's poisoned and needs treatment ASAP. Take him back now. Madam, we know nothing about his background. What if he's a spy? Human life is more important. He's at death's door. We have to treat him first. As for the rest, we can talk later. - Madam! - Don't say another word. I'll explain to Xuande if anything happens. Yes, Madam. Madam, let me do it. No need. I'll do it myself. He's a vulgar man. He doesn't deserve you to feed him. In troubled times, people who're homeless and miserable can be seen everywhere. We don't have the ability to pacify all the people, but we should do everything in our power. Madam, slow down. Cao Cao has unified Northern China. It's a matter of time for him to attack the south. I'll kill all of them with my serpent spear if he dares to come here. Honey, Yunchang and Yide, have some soup. You've been working so hard these days. - Here. - Thank you. Thank you. I heard that you saved a spy and took him back. Oh. I saved someone who's poisoned, but I don't think he's a spy. I guess he's just a passer-by. You're kind-hearted, but the human heart is unpredictable. We'd better be alert. It's easy to judge if he's a spy. We just need to have a look at him. If he really is, I'll chop off his head. It... Yunchang and Yide make a point. Let's interrogate him now. Got it. Zhao Zilong. Are you... Zilong? My Lord, let me show my respect. You're really Zilong! I was wondering who Lady Mi saved. It turns out it's you, Zilong. Madam, thank you for saving my life. I'll never forget your great kindness. Don't do that. I've heard a lot about you. Maybe we were destined to meet each other. Come here. Zilong, how could you become like this? It's a long story. Owing to military disaster, great changes happened to my family and hometown. Zilong, do you have a plan for your future? Nowadays, I have nowhere to go. If you don't mind, I'll follow you faithfully and shrink from no sacrifice. Good! Let the four of us work together to defeat Cao Cao the traitor and rejuvenate the Han Dynasty. CAO General Zhao. Tomorrow morning, our lord will take people to evacuate. You have to pay extra attention tonight to prevent any spies from getting into town. Got it! Zilong. Madam. I've told you numerous times. Like Yunchang and Yide, you're also one of Xuande's brothers. Just call me Sis instead of Madam. Si... Madam, you saved my life. I have to show my respect. I couldn't fall asleep. I guess it'd be quieter on the city wall. The noise in the city must have bothered you and your son. It'll be a long journey tomorrow. You'd better get more rest tonight. Cao Cao led an army of 830,000 and swore to defeat Xuande. I'm a little worried. Please don't worry. I'll make sure you and your son are safe and sound. Zilong, you're wrong. I'm just a woman of no importance. Xuande is the one who may save the world. At moments of crisis, please ignore me and make sure Xuande is safe. I'll always keep your kindness in mind. LIU Attack! The Cao army is here! Hurry. Prime Minister, most of the common people have evacuated with Liu Bei. Only those who are old and weak are left. You traitor! When you grow up, I'll let you live in a time of peace and prosperity. Keep chasing Liu Bei to avoid trouble later on. Got it! The Cao army has caught up. Everyone, run! Madam, leave with your son. We'll try to stop the pursuing forces. Kill them! The Army Advisor has gone to Jiangxia for help, but with these common people, we're moving too slowly. I'm afraid the Cao army will catch up. Yeah, the vanguard of the Cao army is just five kilometers away from us. How about we go to Jiangxia without these common people? Emergency! My Lord, Lady Mi and her son were chased by the Cao cavalry and are trapped and in trouble. Their whereabouts are unknown. My Lord, allow me to go back and save Lady Mi and her son. - No. - Why? Cao Cao has won some people over in the name of serving the emperor. And Sun Quan has got topographical advantages. What I can rely on is my reputation for being kindhearted and righteous. If I give up the common people to save my wife and son, I'll lose ground and fail to win the world. - But... - Let's speed up! Let's go. Zilong. Zilong. I used to be a common villager and would step forward to help a stranger who was in trouble. Lady Mi once saved my life and now she's in danger. I will seek them in heaven or hell, through good or evil. If I find them or not, I'll die on the battlefield. He's defying a military order. He must want to surrender to Cao Cao. Let me kill him! Yide, stop it. Put the common people's safety first. Yunchang, are you trying to stop me? Zilong, do you have to disobey Xuande? In terms of loyalty, Yunchang, I'm no match for you. But I also know one has to be grateful. Lady Mi saved my life and she's in danger now. If I don't go save her, I'd be ashamed to live in the world. The Green Dragon Crescent Blade has been with me for many years. I defeated and slayed many generals and captains with it. It can distinguish right from wrong. This horse is called Red Hare. Lu Bu used to ride it on the battlefield. It can gallop across cities and leap over moats. I hope it can give you a leg up. Thank you, Yunchang. Madam. Madam. Madam, trust me. Even if I have to die the cruelest death, I'll keep your son safe. There is one more guy here! Prime Minister, an enemy is riding the Red Hare ahead. The baby in his arms must be Liu Bei's son. A mountain of swords is in front of us and there is no route of retreat. Today, let's do it together. If this general can work for me, I'm sure to conquer the world. Who is this guy? Can you tell us your name? Zhao Zilong from Changshan! Take my order! No one is allowed to kill him. Anyone who disobeys my order and kills Zhao Zilong will have to pay with his own life. I'm Zhang Liao, General of the Vanguard. I'm here to challenge you. You're just a nobody. Don't be cocky. I'm Xiahou Dun, General Who Builds Martial Might. Let me defeat you! I'm Xu Chu, General of the Military Guards! I'm here to take your life. Prime Minister, because of your order, our soldiers don't dare to hurt Zhao Zilong. But Zhao Zilong showed no mercy. Several of our generals were killed. Our generals and soldiers have been fighting north and south with you and are not afraid of dying on the battlefield. What you're doing will let them down. Zhao Zilong is a courageous warrior, but we're not incompetent! Prime Minister. Prime Minister! - Prime Minister! - Prime Minister! Prime Minister... Prime Minister! It's unwise to shake the morale of troops during a war. Did you forget what happened to Guan Yunchang? The only thing that can relieve my anxiety is the liquor Du Kang. Take my order. Anyone who kills Zhao Zilong will be rewarded heavily and promoted in rank. General Xu, the Red Hare... Bring it on! Bring it on! Don't be arrogant! Zilong, you're back. Zilong, you're back. Zilong, you're back. Zilong, you're back. Zilong, you're back. Zilong, you're back. Zilong, you're back. Zilong, you're back. Zilong is back! Zilong is back! Zilong is back! Zilong, you're back. Prime Minister... Why don't you kill me? If I wasn't carrying a baby with me, I would've been able to take your life, you traitor. Me? Traitor? If I hadn't done those things, numerous people would've declared themselves emperors. If I'm a traitor, what is Liu Bei? My lord is kindhearted and righteous. He's kept the masses in his mind. You can never be compared to him. It's a noble and righteous cause to conquer the south. Now that my life is in your control, how about we make a deal? You spare my life and I'll let you go. You would let me go, but I'm afraid your soldiers wouldn't. This is my personal sword. It's called Blue Steel Sword. No one in my base camp dares to stop anyone who holds it. Cao Cao, you're an ambitious and successful warlord. I believe you won't go back on your word. Prime Minister, don't lay by trouble in the future. I made a promise to him and I can't break it. He's such a brave warrior. If we let him go today, he'll definitely be trouble in the future. It's natural for powerful politicians to fight for supremacy. It feels good. How loyal and valiant Zhao Zilong is!
