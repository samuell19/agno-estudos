He spent the carnival trying to win me one of those giant bears. Spent all his money, has really bad aim. All he ended up with was this consolation prize. [SQUEAKS] But then I thought to myself, maybe he's my consolation prize. I'm moving to New York for college and dreams, and he's playing Halo and contemplating a penis tattoo. So I just said it. "Maybe we should break up." And I was expecting him to say, "No, I can't live without you, Lucy." But instead, he said, "Maybe you're right." And that was it. Now all I have left of our love is this sad, second-place duck. And all his worldly possessions. Lucy, is this his retainer? He used to take it out when we'd make out or have a snack. My favorite kind of memories. He needs this. He has a shark mouth. NADINE: Don't listen to Amanda. Your collecting is quirky and adorable. You're basically an anthropologist. Correct, Nadine. I live in a cave of souvenirs, like The Little Mermaid. Nothing wrong with being sentimental. Sentimental? It was sentimental when we were 12. This is full mental. A bike tire? Okay, this is active trash. [LAUGHING] - What the hell? - [LAUGHING] - A used condom? - Ew! It's not used. It's in the package. Gross matches, old... A Monopoly thimble? That's different. That's not his. I'm sorry, Luce. Okay. Breakup tradition. Let's wait outside of the liquor store for someone to buy us a box of wine. And drink it through Twizzlers. - Yes! Let's go. - Let's go.

Okay, she can't possibly be that scary. She's terrifying. Eva Woolf is the most influential gallerist - in New York. - As your lawyer, - I'm telling you to calm down. - Well, you're not a lawyer. - You're in law school. - Whatever. I can still defend myself when I murder Jeff. - [MOUTHS] I love you. - NADINE: Maybe one day, our paths will cross again. Aw, look at that little baby model. She has no idea she's an endangered species. You gonna marry Yulia and get her a green card? Ah, destiny has other plans for us. Maybe we'll meet in another life. AMANDA: Does she know that? NADINE: That I believe in reincarnation? [AMANDA & NADINE CONTINUE INDISTINCTLY] You know what else I love about Max? Oh, please. We're waiting with bated breath. Ignore her. She hates joy and confetti. Nadine, I've said it five times. Confetti is trash that falls from the sky. Max is a fully grown man. Last night I went to his place in the West Village. - [GASPS] - What? He cooked dinner with ingredients he had in the fridge. - He has a fridge? - What? Know what else he has? Coffee-table books. - Oh! - So he has a trust fund. I can't hear his roommates having sex through the walls - because he has no roommates. - You guys are using those noise-canceling headphones, right? They don't work. - You are so loud. - Sorry. Just can't believe he chose little old me. - That literally makes no sense. - You are a literal goddess. - [MOUTHS] Thank you. - Are you guys exclusive? Have you discussed? Oh, there's no need. I'm satisfying him in all areas. - What more could he want? - Don't be stupid. The first time Jeff was inside me, I told him I would castrate him if he ever spoke to another woman. Fine. I'll confirm tonight. After I impress Eva, enjoy the open-bar spree, it'll be the greatest night of my life. That's what people say in horror movies - before they get herpes and die. - I'm going to work now. No. Little souvenir. This was fun. - Pay up. They're still together. - Oh, yeah. Snacks for later. Come find it. She seems so happy. [LUCY SOBBING] ♪ Baby, have you got no soul? ♪ ♪ Is your heart A gaping hole? ♪ ♪ How come I didn't see that In you? ♪ NICK: What...? Uh... - Excuse me.

This is a private car. You're everyone's private driver. Clever. No, no. That's Uber. Also not what I'm saying. - Can you get out of my car? - Ugh! I selected "no talking." - Listen, Adolfo, I... - Adolfo? I would love to hear your story any other day. It's just that I've had the worst night of my life and I just wanna go home. Where are you going? 7023 Decatur. [♪♪♪] LUCY: Do you have an aux cord? Or just put on Hot 97. Anyway, how was your night? Can't be worse than mine. Do you see this grown-man tie, Adolfo? Well, this belonged to Max, and it's practically all I have left of our love because tonight, he shook up my life to its very core. Ugh! It didn't start this way, Adolfo. Oh, no. I was happy once. In love like a big, dumb idiot. Ooh, this is my favorite part. Just before the show when all the art is being hung. It feels like we're getting the toy store ready for Christmas. Cute. But Eva gets back today and we have a lot to do. I love her so much it gives me diarrhea. She discovered Cindy Sherman in a Laundromat. Gave Basquiat his first solo show. I just wanna grow up to be her. Thrilled that I pay you to socialize. Max, we are meeting with Marlene Dumas this afternoon. Word on the street is she split with Zwirner. Strategy session, my office. Close your mouth, person. It's unbecoming. Up, up, up. Oh, wait. Uh, excuse me, Mr. Sexpot Gallery Director? Hot tip, Marlene Dumas? Focus on her riskier works. I read that she prefers the paintings that embarrass her. You are my favorite secret weapon. God, you make me look good. NICK: Wait, he actually said those words? He was paying me a compliment. Pretty sure the first rule of compliments is, you don't reference yourself in a compliment. Oh. Well, don't interrupt. You're derailing my story. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought this was my car. Well, as I was saying, we were very subtle at work. No one suspected a thing. What's going on with you and Max? Can I help you, Harvard? I may not have feelings, a love life of my own, or any friends, for that matter, but I do have eyes. Okay, you're loitering. Junior year, I took a gender study class at Harvard... - There it is. - ...about the social expectations in a woman's life, and I think you're unconsciously subjugating yourself to prop him up. - LUCY: Classic overachiever. - NICK: She seems really smart. So we had this art opening at the gallery tonight, which is why I'm an absolute vision. Thank you. [EXCLAIMS] - Again! - HARVARD: Wow. You might pace yourself. This is a work event. Calm down, Judge Judy. I am just trying to have fun. Do they teach that at Harvard? Yeah. It's a general education course. Sounds really fun. Wasn't meant to be fun, just educational. Have you seen Max tonight? Looks like Dr. Amelia is back from Paris. What? What are you talking about? Oh, me? I don't know. I don't know anything. I'm not fun. Sorry I couldn't go to an Ivy. I couldn't afford to pretend to row crew, you know? Sue me. Sue me. Max never uttered a word about any sexy doctors, and Harvard's an energy vampire, so I didn't let her get to me. - Hello... - Eva. - You. - Hello, goddess, you, also. I'm not one of those bitches that doesn't empower women. Oh. Well, that is... It's great to hear. So you're up. - What? - Max is giving remarks tonight. Get up there. Introduce him. To be honest, I've had a few tequilas. I don't think... I'm not your sorority sister. Just... Just... Just go. LUCY: So like any booze bag with a fear of public speaking, I had one more. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and those who do not subscribe to traditional gender roles that are a product of patriarchal society. Am I right? Yikes, uh... Uh, sorry. Um... I am here to introduce Max Vora, director of Woolf New York. Max joined, uh, Woolf in 2014. Um... [DISTORTED] Where was I? Uh... Um... Oh. Um... Oh. Told you so. - [NORMALLY] Fuck this. Um, okay. - [GUESTS GASP] Question for the group. Speaking of the devil here, uh, when did dating one person become uncool? I... Because I don't understand. Jane Austen, she didn't write about polyamory. No, no, no. It was just Emma. It wasn't Emmas. Oh, we are living in very muddy times. People are lying constantly. - Oh, shit. - I know. We only have 10 years before we all drown in the melting ice caps, but I swear, the most sacred resource is not the ozone. Oh, no. It's honesty. - Excuse me. Hey. Lucy... - Where is that? No, no, sir. You stay back. I'm... I'm fine. Yep. That... - [LUCY EXCLAIMS, GROANS] - [CROWD GASPS] Are you...? [GUESTS MURMURING] Lucy? Lucy, I know. I know. - I know. - Who is she? It's Amelia. She's my ex. It's complicated. Okay, Lucy, listen. You're a blast. I don't even use that word, but it fits for you. You are so funny. But we're in completely different places in our lives. I'm 35 years old. I need to find that thing. And that thing is not me? - [SIGHS] - [SIGHS] This sucks. Eva doesn't want you to come in tomorrow. Right. That's nice of her. Personal day would be good. I'm probably concussed. Eva doesn't think you should come back... ever. I'm fired? NICK: Honestly, I think you're better off without him. Came to New York to have my own gallery. I can't even hold down a job as a gallery assistant. I'm doomed. - [CELL PHONE RINGS] - [LUCY SIGHS] LUCY: Hello? Oh, okay. Uh... I-I'm sorry, Adolfo. Yeah. No, I'll cancel. Okay. You're not Adolfo? Who are you? My name is Nick. What? Nick, you just drove me home? Are you insane? What was the plan? You're just gonna... What? Weaken me with paint fumes and then just knock me out with lumber? - Leave me for dead? - I did you a favor. - I, too, have had a bad day. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it's locked. - No. No. - Oh, shit. This is the end! - Can I say something? - Help! Help! - Help, please! Oh, my God! - It's unlocked. Oh. Okay. Good night. Thanks. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] - She says, "I don't read books." - God, Nadine. Stop dating the pretty, illiterate ones. But they make the best accessories. But a shared value system is the key to everlasting love. I hate everyone, and I want them to die. So does Jeff. That's why we've been together for six years. Jeff never speaks. That's why you've been together six years. No, but he comes really alive when we make love. - [DOOR OPENS] - [LUCY GROANS] [LUCY SOBBING] Max broke up with me. And I'm fired.

Ask Jeff. Is Jeff in here? Jeff? Hey! What are you doing? You can't have a good relationship because you're mourning the old one. She's right. You live in the past. Yeah. It's because the past is filled with memories and happy times. I mean, how is someone just your everything one minute and then they forget you the next? Ask Nadine. She dumps bitches on the regular. - This is not about me. - Nadine. [BUZZING] - [WHISPERS] Don't do that. - That's it. Hey! No! Amanda, stop. Stop it! Come on. - No! - Please, don't. Please.

Okay, these things, they can't just end up in some landfill. - Do these things spark joy? - Does this spark joy? Yes. Clearly. A lot of joy. - Seriously? - Yes. At least get rid of the ex memorabilia. Give it back to the guys you dated. What? I just call my exes out of the blue? - Yeah. - The ex memorial goes today. Fine. Okay, a few things. Not this. CLAYTON: Yeah, Luce, I don't... I don't think that I can accept this. Don't you have a box under your bed where you keep mementos from past relationships? Yeah, I do. And I even have, like, a thing or two from us, but, um... What? Well, like, your collecting is... It's creepy. I couldn't be with someone who just needed to memorialize every second of every day. And not to mention your room. Whenever I would stay over... it was like hooking up in a mausoleum. I'm sure that's on someone's bucket list. - I don't... - We broke up because of my stuff? - Not no. - Huh. I think we can take this, but most of this is crap. Crap? What? You have a whole shelf of crap back there. Those were my mother's. Oh, so you get it. Right? No. Those are collectibles. This is crap. This is ridiculous. Literally, no one understands me, so I'm just gonna just be on my way. Okay. Are we done? No. No, we're not done. Can I have a job application? Even after she ghosted me, um... I still keep them.

Okay, okay. You can let me go. That's the craziest thing I've ever seen. I had it under control until you interfered. You magically show up everywhere. Are you my stalker? I think the words you're looking for are "thank you." And then I say, "You're welcome." Oh. I'm Lucy. Charmed, I'm sure. [CHUCKLES] You good, Lucy? - Yeah, yeah. No, I'm okay. - Okay. I'm just processing it. Wait. Wait. Hey, hello. What? You just manhandled me. You're gonna leave me on the street? Hey! Hey! You hit her? You just hit her? - No, no, no. - Oh, no. I see what's going on. You hit her. - No. - Okay. That's cool, man! - You hit a lady. That's nice. - No, no, no. - I didn't. - LUCY: This is my fault. This is not your fault. Being a woman is like living in a goddamn nobody-believes-me movie every day, okay? But today is not that day because we are gonna fight him. - Come at me, homey. - I really... - Come at me! - Oh, no. - NICK: Oh, my God. Fuck! - You come at me! This is all your fault. I'm so sorry. We should probably get some ice on that. Here's an idea: Why don't you leave me alone? Only a terrible person would leave you in your time of need. Yeah. And I think you are that terrible person. No. I'm nice. If you got to know me, you'd be obsessed with me. Hm? Oh, great. Okay, the car was just pre-game. This is where you actually murder me. And yet you are still following me. So, what?

You're serious? - Yes. Welcome to the Chloe Hotel. I'm building a place that feels like the spots I fell in love with when I first moved to New York. Those little places that can only exist here. But I've spent five years, and, as you can see, every cent that I have, and it's all falling to shit. So, what are you gonna do? Looks like it's coming together. Is this gonna be the lobby? Heh-heh, nothing gets by you. What's gonna happen up there? That's phase two. I can't afford to touch it right now. [WINCES] Still hurts? - Yeah. Just a bit. - You're doing it wrong. - Give it to me. - How am I doing it wrong? Can't have ice touching the skin. You need a middleman. Okay. Do you want some whiskey? Yes, please. She really got you good, huh? Yeah. She sure did. Here. This will cure what ails you. [♪♪♪] LUCY: Wow, whiskey really is - Mother Nature's painkiller, huh? - NICK: Mm-hm. What have you got in here, Lucy? Oh, my God. An espresso machine? - Don't go too deep. - And a sock. - Cat in the Hat. - Okay. Yep. Oh, my God. Are those...? Are those toenail clippings? You've seen quite enough, mister. Yeah. - I'm just gonna... - Oh, my God. - Thanks for coming. - I get it. You're a pessimist. [GASPS] That is the worst thing anyone has ever said to me. You collect these things in anticipation that your relationships are going to end. - No. No, no, no. - It's crazy. You're wrong. They're a celebration of memories. - You're a hoarder. - I'm not a hoarder. - Hoarder. Hoarder. - Take it back. - I'm not a hoarder. - You want evidence that your relationships existed in the first place. Are you afraid that you won't remember the guys you dated? I don't need to explain myself to you. How about you, huh? You've never collected anything - from a past relationship? - No. I'm a minimalist. I can fit everything I own inside a backpack. When the zombie apocalypse comes, I'm out. Oy. You're one of those. Yeah. One of... - One of what? - You know. "I'm a lone wolf. I don't need anybody." But really you are just scared of showing your insides. Yeah. Everyone either leaves, disappoints or dies. Okay, Mr. Rogers. Can't wait for the new show: Uplift the Nation. So funny. What are you gonna do with this stuff? That's a good question. When love crumbles, how do you preserve its ruins? - Why don't you leave it here? - What? No. - Come on. - No, I can't do that. - Just let go. - No, no, no. It's okay. - Sure. It'll be okay. - Okay. This, uh... Oh, look. It's a nail. Perfectly placed. Would you look at that? Hm... That kind of looks cool. - It's like art in a gallery. - Mm. The Sad Gallery. More like the Broken Heart Gallery. Do you have a marker? - What? - You have a marker, I just... - No, I don't. - Come on. Please. - I have a brilliant idea. - Why do you want it? I'm feeling inspired. Let me express. Uh... Think fast. Nice. Oh, sure. Draw on the wall. [♪♪♪] New York... Thank you for letting me express myself. You're welcome. Wait. What's the security like in this place? Is there security? You're worried someone is gonna break into my unfinished hotel and steal your ex-boyfriend's tie? No. That won't happen, right? - No, it wouldn't happen. - No. No, you're right. I should leave it. Yeah, I can leave this. It'll be good. I'm... I'm gonna leave it. Uh, no. I can't, actual... No. - What? You're looking at me. - I'm not. What? - I'm sorry. This just got weird. - It's okay. No, I'm... I'm gonna go. But, um, I will... Bye. Bye. He was my high school sweetheart. He moved across the country, and we lost touch. Uh, but smoked too much weed, wouldn't call you back. He would be a terrible husband. So I make my husband wear it when we [BLEEP]. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] NADINE: Lucy? Babe? Are you okay? Maybe you could try to get a job? My birthday week is coming up. I expect a thoughtful and expensive gift. NADINE: There's no birthday week. AMANDA: The week of your birthday. You're not a 16th-century monarch. You can't command multiple days for your festivities. [LINE BEEPS OVER PHONE] LUCY: Remember our Monopoly tournaments? Well, I need a Get Out Of Jail Free card. Anyway, last night, it was rough. Um... I wish I could talk to you about it. Bye. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] NICK: Lucy. Nick? - Can I come in? - Uh... No. No, no, no. Lucy is dead. How'd she die? - Decapitated on a roller coaster. - That's a shame. She had such a nice head. And you are not wearing any pants. Heh. Pants. No. Not wearing those. - [CLEARS THROAT] - Uh... Shoelaces in a bag? Go ahead. Judge me. No judgments. Wait. What are you doing here? I wanna show you something. Come on. - How did you get in here? - Your roommates let me in. Oh, those bitches. [♪♪♪] LUCY: Okay. So this map was just here when you showed up this morning? - Yep. - Who could have left it? I know a construction worker, a delivery guy, one of your multiple personalities? This is amazing. There are broken people out there like me, people who need to let go and move on. Good. Well, you can take the stuff and move on. There's nowhere else like this. I wish someone had done this for me. The Broken Heart Gallery could be a community service. No. This is my hotel. It is not some sort of Lost and Found for hoarder stalkers. - Again, not a hoarder. - Hoarder. No. We've been through this. Oh, wow, this is the shrine to exes you were talking about? I didn't say... I... - It's a direct quote. - I didn't say that. Lucy, this is my friend Marcos. Hey. Oh, my God. We're friends now? That explains why I'm building a bar top for you for free. - Can you not...? - Friendship. Servitude. Don't listen to him. I am the godfather to his unborn child. No, he's lobbying for the position of godfather. Heh. Plot twist: It's not going well. If I had to guess, you know? Would you want this man to be your spiritual guide? Ha-ha, no. Maybe my TV guide. - Oh, wow. Terrible dad joke. - Am I right? I like her. Let's get to work. - Okay. - Nice to meet you. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. I can help. I... I can help with the hotel in exchange for gallery space. - No. - Huh? No, I can help. I can... I can paint. I can saw. I can lift and lay tile, grout. - Is that...? That's a thing. - Yeah. It's not gonna happen. That sounds like free labor. And, Nick, you love free labor, don't you? - LUCY: You do. Come on. - Come on. You don't have a plan for the balcony. I did say I had a plan for the balcony. I just said it was phase two. Sorry, uh, balconies are really important. - LUCY: He gets it. - They're essential. - What is going on? - MARCOS: Two people agreeing. - Maybe eternal friendship. - We're bonding. We're friends? We should take it step by step, but sure. - Okay. - It's a good start. - I hate both of you. - Is that a yes? - No. No. - Yes. We could use the help. You start tomorrow, 7 in the morning. Get us the coffee, right? You know, gotta pay the piper. We do love oat milk. Get almond milk if you don't have it. Soy milk, whatever. Have fun. But nothing with actual dairy. He gets really sensitive in his tummy. - Okay. All right. Let's... - He has IBS, it's embarrassing. - IBS is a real thing. - Stop it. - Tell me about his tummy. - This is not happening.

Good morning, building buds! Who's ready to work? Because I am. Check me out. Look at this belt, a practical belt for tools. Ha! Here is your coffee, Marky Mark. All right, Lucy Liu. Ha! And then, for you, I got the special milks. Thank you. - Dude. - Sorry. Her Majesty is a little upset this morning, so tread lightly. Oh, no. We need to talk about our feelings? Because the CFO has arrived. Chief Feelings Officer is here. Let's hold hands. Okay, bring it in, guys. God. Dad jokes. Okay, I'm out. See you, dude. Bye. Who is this person? Yeah, you're in the right place. Hi. Hey. Uh, whew. Are you here for the Broken Heart Gallery? Yeah. Is this that heartbreak thing? Yeah. You're in the right place. Welcome. I'm Lucy, head curator. Yeah. Willhelmina. So how's this, uh, whole thing work? I don't know. How does this whole thing work? Uh, well, why don't you we start by you telling me what you brought and why? Yeah. Uh, well, met my ex, Gina, while I was actually... Oh, wait. Pause. Uh, do you mind if I record this? Just, you know, for our socials. Yeah. Sure. Take a step back against this. Right. Here? Ooh, that is perfect. And go. I was in the hospital. I was recovering from a pretty nasty skydiving accident. She was my nurse. I had a body cast covered all my tats, so Gina, she drew these ones on for me. When I could walk, I asked her to marry me. But she changed her mind three weeks later. No. Damn, Gina. Anyway, time passed, but this just... sat in the corner of my bedroom, taunting me. How long have you held on to it for? Six... Five years. Five years. Feels good to admit that, you know? Then I heard about this place. And how exactly did you hear about this place? My masseuse's Instagram. How did your masseuse hear about it? Don't listen to him. Are you ready to hand it over? Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready. Okay. [GRUNTS SOFTLY] Ooh, it has an odor. Oh. Okay. Mm. You did it. I did it. How does it feel? This is the first time in, like, five years that I feel a little lighter. Really? Yeah. That's amazing. Uh, thank you. If you ever wanna see this again, you can visit any time. It'll be in my care, right here. Okay. Or, perhaps, at another location. No, definitely at this location. Don't worry about him. Who is he? Uh, just one last thing. We just ask for a small donation. Just to keep the gallery going. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There you go. It's only 5 bucks. It's all I have. Perfect. All right. Thank you so much. We're in business, baby. And Bonus Jonas, I'm making you clams. I'm going to take this. [♪♪♪] Thing about breakups is, someone can ruin your life just by disappearing, you know? Then you hang on to the hope that they'll barrel through your door full of believable explanations as to why they didn't actually ghost you, or lose your number, or just stop loving you. So, what my ex left was a jar of organic Choconut. So, heartbroken, I would spoon it little by little while listening to Michael Bolton's "When I'm Back On My Feet Again." It's rancid now. Kind of like my ex-girlfriend's soul. I hate you. Just kidding. I hope you die. How do you get over someone? You press some button on your body - and morph into a cyborg? - Just keep going. Don't look back, don't dwell on anything. Oh, okay, so you just bottle everything up until you implode in a fiery act of self-destruction? No. I manage my expectations. [♪♪♪] Marcos took another job. Our interior designer quit last week, but I'm fine. I'm not upset. Why? Because I saw it coming a mile away and I managed my expectations. Okay, so you don't ask anything of anyone, which is why you're not asking me right now. Huh? - Asking you what? - I'll be your interior designer. - Come on! - Good God. Designer is just a fancy word for curator. Or it's the other way around. But regardless, there's cool stuff all around us. You need someone to help you look for it. NICK: Okay, but cool stuff means expensive, and I'm pretty much broke. LUCY: The key to collecting is seeing value where others usually don't. You know, one lady's trash is another lady's treasure. Kind of like relationships. NICK: And where might one find - these treasures? - LUCY: Well, it is moving day. First day of the month, leases start and end, so New Yorkers are leaving pure gold out on these streets. Ah! She's cute, she's charming, she's calling my name. She looks like rats live inside of her. Well, then she's habitable. Lucy, it's 40 blocks to the Chloe. - We are... We're not walking. - [CHUCKLES] Welcome to the nonviolent firearms show. Oh, my God. How do I seem to find myself in this predicament? [♪♪♪] - I'm tired. Can we take a break? - [LAUGHS] Absolutely not. This was your idea. Fine, but can you distract me? Tell me your life story. - My life story? - Yeah. But my life hasn't even happened yet. Don't you ever think about what you're gonna tell your biographer? Is that something you think about? All the time. It'll begin as such: "It all started on a sticky August afternoon." Oh, my God. Lucy, stop. Stop it. Ah. Okay. Your life story. Go. - Really? - Yes. Oh, um... My parents really never settled down. We moved a ton. Oh, that must have been hard. Think it make... Made me independent. Hm. So where would you go on holidays? Grandma's house. Hm, tell me more about G-Ma. Well, she lived in this little place called Kenosha, which is in Wisconsin. She looked like a Keebler elf. My grandma loved two things, - football and boxing. - Mm. She chewed tobacco till she was 90. - Nice. - And I always thought she was this sweet old grandma, but it turns out she was a bookie her entire life. - Okay, Grandma. Mm-hm. - I know. What a badass! After she died, they found a wad of cash under her mattress. And she left it for me. That's what you used to start the Chloe. - Yeah. - And then you named it after her? That's such a sweet tribute. - I didn't actually... - Ice cream! [ICE CREAM TRUCK PLAYING JINGLE] LUCY: Hey! [♪♪♪] LUCY: You know, we still haven't been to the coolest little shop in Brooklyn. Only real insiders know about it. NICK: And what about you? Why New York? I followed a man. Did the man know you were following him? He did when I snuck into his apartment, impaled him with an ice pick and feasted on his remains. Frightening. But what's the real reason? Well, growing up, my mom was an art history professor at Bard. So it was winter like 90 months of the year. So every weekend, she'd take me to the Hessel Museum. And she taught me that art tells stories about people, places, movements, moments in time. The coolest thing about my mom is... she really sees art... in everything. Like, anywhere. What city has more art than New York? [♪♪♪] You know, I think this project is really having a positive impact on me. I woke up this morning, my pillow was totally dry. And then feel my bag. It's so light. I am growing too. I have not called you a hoarder today. Ha, typical man. Proud of himself for something that isn't an achievement. Okay. Good talk. I'm gonna go get a coffee. - Do you want anything? - No, I quit coffee. Only water or booze for this temple. I'm Paleo. I'm not sure that's what Paleo means. No, no. It has to do with nuts. - Okay. I'm gonna go. - Okay. - Hi there. - Hi. MAX: I'm here for the 72-inch television. Wow, you guys are like the last book shop on earth, huh? We're the real deal. It was my grandfather's. Oh, okay. Well, I was about to say something that... It wouldn't have gone well. Anyway, thank you so much. - Have a great day. - All right. - Oh, hey! Your case. - Oh, I got it. I know him. Thanks. [♪♪♪] [BABY WAILING] Oh, excuse me. Do you mind? Move! Oh, my God! Move. Excuse me. Do you have a moment for Planned Parenthood? Okay. Do you have a moment for Planned Parenthood? - Uh... Yes. - Thanks. I gotta go. Do you have a moment for Planned Parenthood? Oh, you don't care about reproductive rights? MAX: It's a first edition. - No. - Yeah. - [GASPS] - Lucy! Oh! Oh. Max! Hi! Oh, my God. This is so random. Um... Hi. - Bonjour. - Oh, French. Oh, sorry. I just got back from Paris, so it's still in there. - Right. - MAX: Heh, this is Amelia. You saw her the night that, uh... Are you okay? I'm a doctor, so... Me? Me? Me good. Me... Uh, I'm great. - Because last time... You know. - Mm-hm, mm-hm. Oh! Right. That night. Oh, my God. That was such a fun night. I was just really living my truth and, like, enjoying myself. I'm in my mid-20s. You know, I barely even wash my face. And sometimes I moisturize, if I feel fancy. But I just have the collagen ready to go. I'm 26, so... Lucy! Hi. There you are. Uh... Got the, uh, flat white for you. - LUCY: Uh, I... - Yeah. I'm her assistant, Nick. - Hey. I'm Max. - Hi. This one really knows how to treat her staff, you know? - Staff? - NICK: She didn't tell you? Lucy started her own gallery. Yeah. Big deal. I mean, it's still underground, but it's gonna be... It's gonna blow up. Big. Big time. - Blowing. Lots of blowing up. - Yeah. That's, um... That's exceptional. Um... Where is it? I'd love to come visit. And we would also love you to come visit sometime, but we are late for that meeting with that... - Meeting. Larry. - Larry! Larry. - Gagosian? - Mm-hm. - Yeah. He's like a... - Yeah. How did you describe him? Like a... Oh, he's like a post-modern teddy bear. - Just the sweetest guy. - NICK: Yeah. You know? - Oh, yeah. - Never met him. - We have to... - He hates it when we're late. - We should really run. - He does. - But great to see you. - Nice to meet you. Gagosian? Okay. Shit. Heh. He's just moved on. It's... Why is it so hard for me and so easy for him? - Am I that forgettable? - Are you kidding? Max aches for you. He said so himself. You're the wild card, the fun, the sparkle. - You think so? - I... He thinks so. - Yes. - Right. - Come on. Let's go in here. - Okay. Do you think Max and the doctor have moved in together? No. No, Max likes his personal space, so... Ugh, she probably has an amazing but crazy skin care routine. What if he likes it? Wait, where are we? Great, is this the third attempt at murder? Can we get it over and done with, please? Just put me out of my misery. Hey, Yan. Do your thing. [♪♪♪] What? YAN: I'll never tire of that reaction. - Yan. - Hey, man. How's the hotel going? - Excellent. - Eh, don't listen to her. She's a glass-half-full kind of gal. You're right, yeah. It's better to be a brooding cynic. Can you please go get my sign? So he just makes anything in neon? Yeah, including a blinking sign over your head - that says "Keep Back 200 Feet." - Oh, ha-ha-ha. Check this out. It's gonna look great hanging in the lobby of the Chloe. LUCY: "In medias res." It's Latin for "Into the middle of things." It's what the hotel stands for. It's a place where people will meet and intersect in our story. The Chloe will always be a place they stopped along the way. - See? I have feelings. - Mm... [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] LUCY: Remember when I drove my car into a parked school bus? Well, I'm not the mess you once knew. I have my shit together. Promise. NICK: Hey. - Who was that? - No one. Oh, hello, fancy pants. Where are you off to? Well, uh, we are going to the bank. I have that meeting, and I am terrified. This is it. Make or break, right? I'm coming along to play the race card. I think it'll be very effective. - Thank you. - Look on the bright side. The gallery is bringing in a bunch of revenue. Uh, no. I'm cautiously optimistic - in a very negative way. - I've lost all hope. But we should probably... Wait, wait. Before you go, take a seat. - I want you to listen to this. - We're... No, come on. It'll just take a minute. It'll be good for you. I need to share. "Dwayne and I met on New Year's Eve. We stole this bottle of champagne and resolved to drink it together the next year. But Dwayne got sick and next year never came. Lately, I've found myself drinking alone, but this is the one bottle I can't bring myself to open." Nope. Nope! [EXHALES SHARPLY] - Nick, are you crying? - MARCOS: Why...? No. Why would I...? What? Why wouldn't you cry? Dwayne is dead, dude. They're about to drink together and now he's a ghost. He didn't ghost him. He's an actual ghost. Why would you do that? We're about to blackmail a man into giving us money. I don't know. Crying's my favorite activity. It's true. She's very good at it. - Thank you. - Last weekend we got together and just re-enacted scenes from The Notebook. - I wrote you every day. - Every day? - I wrote you every day! - I never stopped thinking... As much as I admire this budding friendship, we have to go because we are running late. Sure. - Upper hands. Okay. - Marcos, let's go. - You got this. Good luck. - I'm okay. April, 2006. Maxwell Desmond's bar mitzvah. So I show up and I do my best move for him. He was just kidding. He actually had gotten an over-the-pants handy from Jenny Gluck that night. Um, so I've kept this yarmulke as a reminder that men can hurt you.

You never asked. You never really asked me about myself, ever. - I know I made a detour... - A detour? That's what we're calling that?

I've tried every gallery in the greater tristate area. You haven't tried everyone. Oh, heh. Right, yeah. I'm sure Eva just misses watching me eat my own ass in front of her eyes.

Well, what if a handsome man with a cute, cute butt put in a good word for you and all you have to do is pick up the phone and see what happens? - Really? - Maybe. Cliffhanger.

I've learned a few things in my day. Never look at your body naked under a fluorescent light. It's only okay to bounce a check once. After that, it's a thing you're known for. And when you see talent, grab it. I'd like to include the Broken Heart Gallery as an exhibit here at the Woolf in one week. Show your collection alongside mine. What?

You know what happened. That's over. Just be honest with me. I really thought I was gonna marry her. And she wasn't ready. And she moved to Paris. And then she came back right when she sensed you could be happy, which is always how that happens. So you kept hurting me because she kept hurting you. - I didn't mean to hurt you. - No, of course not. You're the hero of your love story and the villain in mine. We're just not meant to be together. I'm gonna go. Paris, it's an amazing place, and, um... We were staying at La Bristol, which is incredibly fancy. It's a little overrated, if you ask me. I drew a bath, and I wanted her to get in it with me. Personally, I hate baths. They're a warm, wet place to overthink. So she left to get a pastry for... five hours. I bummed a cigarette off of Olivier. I sat in the tub, shriveling. So, naturally, I realized I had to move to Paris. I kept the bath water. Oh, sweet Jesus, he was gorgeous. I drank a little. So, in conclusion, I've made hoarding chic. You'd be proud. A triumph for pack rats everywhere. Who are you talking to? Oh, uh, no one. You are always making these weird, sneaky phone calls and leaving messages for someone. Are you here to talk about my phone bill? Or are you here to apologize? [CLEARS THROAT] - I'm sorry. - Ah, option B. - Excellent choice. - Uh... You were the first person I wanted to tell. Miraculously, a private lender backed me and I got the loan. - What? - I did it, I got it. You got...? That's amazing! Well, you're not the only one with good news. Eva Woolf wants to make the Broken Heart Gallery a reality - by sponsoring it at the Woolf. - No way. And despite you being a dick monster, since the hotel is gonna be saved, I wanna keep the exhibit at the Chloe. Wow, I'm really happy for you, Lucy. You deserve it. I'm sorry. I've never had a guy be happy for my success before. It's kind of weird, but... No, it's good. Wait. How are we gonna pull it off in time? Please. I've been waiting my whole life to pull this off.

Yeah, sit down, take a load off. Look at you. Want to play a board game? [SIGHS SOFTLY] Monopoly. My all-time favorite. Me too. I used to play almost every night with my daughter... Lucy. Lucy. [♪♪♪] I'm sorry, I didn't, uh... Yeah. Yeah, so if you could just stop flirting with my mother, that'd be great. Her mother. I am far too young. Look at this body. It's as tight as a Mormon teenager. Mom! Ha-ha-ha! What? Ah, are you jealous? You know, a wise woman once told me jealousy is unbecoming. - Oh, really? - Mm-hm. - You said that. - Ha. Oh. [NICK PLAYS "DON'T GO BREAKING MY HEART"] CHERYL: I love piano players. - Is he your boyfriend? - No. - Well, you can't marry him. - No. No, I would never. I'm going to. - Heh!

I think we gotta do it again. Yeah, me too. NICK [OVER PHONE]: Meet me at the neon store at 10 a.m. tomorrow. I have another surprise for you. A surprise? Count monster in. So now that you and Nick are "gu-goh..." Is that what you think heterosexual sex looks like? Makes me nervous just thinking about it, but now that you guys are, you know, what have you collected from him? A safety net because she rescued him. Well, we're partners. Partners help each other. AMANDA: And visit each other's moms. - That's very serious. - Mm-hm. Oh, and by the way, my mom fully hit on him. Cheryl is a legend. - Oh, yes. Cheryl. - Get it, Cheryl. BARISTA: Lucy. - How much I owe you? - No, no, no. These are on me. It's the least I could do. Your gallery has helped me so much. After Dwayne died, I was lost. One minute we were laughing, stealing that bottle of champagne. And the next... I kept everything that he owned. The thought of letting go meant facing reality and I just couldn't, so... Again, you really helped. Wow. - Thank you. - Thank you. So I'll see you at the gallery opening? Yes. Most definitely. And I'm gonna bring a date. Nice. Look at you, Oprah, healing the masses. I think what Amanda is trying to say is, you're very inspiring. You should have your own TED Talk. No, I'm trying to say she's Dolly Parton. We had eight blissful years together. He was really focused on work, but, um... That's what I loved about him. His passion, his intellect. This is how I like to remember him. [SIGHS] I mean, isn't he beautiful?

No, I didn't. You assumed. Like you always do. You never corrected me. - You built this for her? - No. - Are you with her? - No. If you just give me a second - to explain it to you... - Explain what? You mocked me for keeping Max's tie and you built a hotel in her honor? That's not fair. You started a gallery for Max. No. No. You don't get to do that. I showed you exactly who I am. From the very beginning. I introduced you to my mom. And now you've lied to me? I feel like... I don't... I don't even know you. I wanted to tell you, okay? I just didn't know when or how. It's not easy for me to open up like it is for you. No, it's not easy for anyone, Nick. The best part about being selfish is, you get to do it alone. This is clearly a bad time. I'm gonna go. No. Your name is on the door. You stay. I'll go. Hey. I guess she slipped this under the door one night when I was working late. I didn't find it, uh, you know, until two years after we broke up. - Tonya's out of my life. - Obviously. I had to dump her ass. Like N'Sync. Like "Bye, Bye, Bye." - Hey, guys! - Okay, I don't... Is Lucy home? She's on the roof? Great. Thanks. AMANDA: Just so you know, if a gorgeous woman just pushed you off the roof, and she, you know... She was wearing a blue, really, like, beautiful jumpsuit. And you fell to the ground and you just died instantly. And your lifeless body was just kind of sitting there. - And then this other girl... - Who's also gorgeous. - Gorgeous. - Who's a stay-at-home model. Stay-at-home model in a purple top. If she just was driving this monster truck and she just kept running over your face. Just over and over and over and over. Yeah. And, like, you were completely not recognizable anymore, um... We would say it was an accident. Yeah. And we have two alibis and a Jeff. And I know from law school, that's a really strong case. Ironclad. Cool. Okay. Goodbye. Heh. Nice to... Jeff. Great. [♪♪♪] Listen, I wanted to tell you that... What? The Broken Hearts Ball is your night, and I just wanted you to know that... I'm gonna steer clear of the hotel, okay? The Chloe Hotel? For what it's worth, I was only showing her around. I named the hotel after her a long time ago, and it got too late and too expensive... to change it. I'm sorry. Okay. Many artists have fallen in love with me. Oh, wow, I didn't see you there. Uh, but, yes, I know about all your lovers. That's a very strange thing to say. Very odd. I have something for your installation. I married a man who was jealous about everything. If I was enthusiastic about a book, about a place, about a flower, about a human being... jealous. There's nothing inside. I left him. I sold the ring. I started the Woolf Gallery, and I vowed to represent artists who made me feel enthusiastic. I never looked back. Wow. Did you regret marrying him? Never. I wouldn't be me if our paths hadn't crossed. I also wouldn't be me if I hadn't let go. Pain, my dear, is inevitable. It's what you do with it that matters.

Oh, we're getting a divorce. - We were never married. - Well, hurry up and ask me so I can fricking divorce you already! [CHUCKLES] - Will you marry me? - Get out! That's why I think possums are pretty much the coolest animal in the entire world. But if you're gonna have possums in there, meerkats need to be in the conversation. They stand up on hind legs, looking around everywhere. They also can run on four legs. You can feed them bugs. They run around in the desert... MARCOS: Don't touch that jerky. It's too close to the bug spray. - So you're really not coming? - I don't know, man. Don't feel well and I'm worried about the hotel opening and... I think I'm coming down with a fever. So, yeah. Do you mind feeling my forehead? - It's hot, right? - You're fine. - That's what I thought. - We have to go. I didn't put heels on to show up late. Real comforting. You guys are gonna be great parents. Ugh, a sick man disgusts me. You need to explain to him what's going on. No, I don't. He's a moron. Look at him. Like you're so evolved? All men are morons. - We let you run things. - Not the humanity speech. You ruined the planet, started wars, killed the bees. You raped and pillaged. If you opened your eyes to what was going on in the world, you'd never stop crying. I had nothing to do with that, but I will take it. As far as men go? He's way stupider than I am. You do realize I'm standing right here and I can hear you? - Yeah, well, I pointed at you. - Listen up. You're not sick. You need to tell him what's going on. - No, I don't. - I will be outside. - Please come back? - We're not going to be late! All right. - Nick, you're not sick, buddy. - Oh, I feel very ill. - Right.

She's your knight in shining armor and you're the stupidest princess I've ever met. No. You know what? I'm not a stupid princess. Take these. I didn't mean it literally. Don't take offense.

Welcome to the Broken Heart Gallery. [ALL CHEERING] Yes! Yes. This gallery does not have hundred-thousand-dollar paintings or precious sculptures. It has... crap. A lot of it. [ALL LAUGH] But these are the things we keep, the souvenirs that tell the stories of our lives, even if that is a half-eaten crab cake. [ALL LAUGH] [♪♪♪] - Hey, I need that order. - I thought you canceled it. - Yeah. Can you un-cancel it? - Yeah. I began collecting, uh, because I lost someone a long time ago. Um, her body is still here, but her memory is gone... so in many ways, she is gone too. My mother was my first heartbreak. I was afraid I would end up like her, that I would forget and be forgotten. So I clung to things, which kept me from moving forward. Heartbreak is the loneliest, most isolating feeling in the world. And the truth is, it happens to us all. It is the great equalizer. And without heartbreak, I wouldn't have built this place. So I guess, in the end, the thing that broke me... also made me whole. NICK: Lucy! Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. [GUESTS MURMURING] WOMAN: Whoa! Sorry. Okay. [PANTING] - Lucy. - Uh... So I'd like to direct your attention - to some of the installations... - Lucy! [SOFTLY] Well, this is awkward. Uh... Nick! What are you doing? What does it look like? It's... It's a grand gesture. - [GIGGLING] - LUCY: Uh... This is kind of a bad time. If you just wanna wait patiently, quietly, - until I'm done... - No. No, I can't do that. [EXHALES SHARPLY] The map was mine. - Wait. What? - The map. I put the map in here. I know I said he... - It's kind of random. - I don't know. I was just trying to throw you off. I met Chloe working at a hotel. And she was... I fell in love with her. And then she left me for my boss. And I was devastated. And I promised myself that I would never let anyone make me feel that way again. And then I met you. And so I put the map on the wall because I wanted to see you again. Oh. Uh... Could have just asked me to dinner or something. - Yeah. In hindsight. - Next time. Probably. Good thing, you know? But love makes you do crazy, stupid, irrational things, and... And I guess what I'm trying to say, Lucy, is... I love you. [CROWD SIGHING, MURMURING] Uh... Try it again. Try it again. I love you, Lucy. Yeah, I heard you. Gonna get back to my speech now. [CROWD MURMURING] - Maybe I should just... - You should stay. Sort of awkward that you're not... [WHISPERS] Oh, my God. RANDY: Love him back! Right? Yeah, I think you should love him back.

Excuse me. Thank you, excuse me. [♪♪♪] Hi. I'm a lump of coal. I feel nothing. I changed the name of the hotel. It's... It's no big deal.
