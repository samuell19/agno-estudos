Hey, Nomi, we're going to leave around two. See you guys there. Oh, and call me back. You need to talk to Sam before you leave I was hoping she'd ride up with me. Merry fucking Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Are you excited to get away? I definitely am. All right, let's get there before my brother and Max. We can clean the rooms. And Nick. Wait, what? Yeah, he heard Tommy and Max talking about it. He didn't wanna go home for Christmas, so they invited him. Bully for us, then. Would I fuck Nick? I think I need to sharpen my skates. Yeah, you look like shit out there. At least I didn't score on my own net last year. At least I'm not a ginger idiot. Fuck off. Hey, you did tell your sister I was coming, right? Yeah. And? And nothing. You know Nomi. If she's pissed, she's not gonna tell me. Thomas, phone for you. Got it! - Yo. - Hey, what are you still doing down at the rink? Practicing with Max. Dude, it's almost two! Oh, shit, I haven't even packed my bags. Max, we gotta go! My God. Now there's a sight for sore eyes. Anyway, as I was saying about my truck... Looks like. I'm standing, and I hear this screeching. It was almost like screaming. So I start to get a little bit nervous 'cause it's coming my way, it's getting closer. I was scared, Ray. I've never been scared before. Easy. I shit you not, I jumped in my truck and I tore out of there, and I could hear it - clawing at the window. - Do they have got chocolate? I couldn't see it. I could hear it, and it's getting louder and louder. And I get home, and, get this, my door is all fucked up. It's covered in claw marks. No shit, Hank. Where you headed? Cypress. Just like Hank here, you're gonna have to take pass up to the mountain. What do you think it was? I can't say for sure. But I bet it likes to eat little girls. On the house. - Let's go. - Thanks. You're welcome, sweetheart. You girls have fun now. What the fuck was up with that guy? I don't know, he can choke. Do you guys think that story was true? No, get real, Sam. They just say that to people passing through town to scare them. It's total bullshit. So, you're saying I shouldn't feel guilty for stealing this? - Look at you! - Oh, yay! ♪ That's my girl, that's my girl ♪ ♪ That's my girl, that's my girl ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, uh ♪ What a downer. Do we have anything else back there, Sam? I think I have a few upbeat ones in the seat pocket. Do you wanna talk about it? No, I'm fine, it's fine. My brother invited the dude who shit all over my heart to share a two-bedroom cabin with me and my friends, because why the fuck not? But I'm fine. Seriously, I'm fine. So, you're fine, then? What? Oh, well, what can you do? It'll be good. No, it'll be great. Are you holding out on us back there? I just wanted to lighten the mood. Do you want some? You know I do. Tommy, grab some smokes. Hey, man, do you wanna grab me a box of condoms? I don't know if Sam's bringing any. Sure, sure, absolutely. Thanks. Dude, don't try to fuck my sister again. I swear to God. I wasn't even thinking it. I swear to God, this is gonna be a drama-free Christmas. - Hey. - Hey. Can I get a pack of Lucky Cats? Sure thing. Where you boys headed? Cypress. Oh, it's real nice up there this time of year. You been there before? No. Yeah, when I was a little kid. Oh, yeah, well, the roads can be a bit of a bitch, so watch yourself. All right. That'll be 17.50. 20. You'll need these, too. Thanks, man. You're welcome. - Your change. - Sweet. You boys have a merry Christmas. Thanks, you, too. - Take care. - See you around. Man, what a great guy. Yeah. - You get my smokes? - Yeah. All right, let me drive. Get fucked. Let's go. - I can't hear you. - Okay. Fuck. God. Ooh, damn. Thank you. Want some. How did you find this place again? It was my great uncle's. I haven't been here since I was like five, but my grandma wanted it used before it's torn down. Ooh, and at the very least we can enjoy "Shawshank Redemption." Seems to be quiet. Yeah, all the old lots have been sold. They're gonna build a fancy lodge out here or something. You know what that means? ♪ No neighbors, no noise complaints ♪ ♪ No neighbors, no noise complaints ♪ ♪ No neighbors, no noise complaints ♪ ♪ No neighbors, no noise complaints ♪ ♪ No neighbors, no noise complaints ♪ ♪ No neighbors, no noise complaints ♪ ♪ No neighbors, no noise complaints ♪ I'm taking this room. I like that one better. Well, bunkmate, my feet are perpetually cold, and I will be hogging all the blankets. I'll beware. Hey! We should go find a little Charlie Brown Christmas tree. Right now? It's cold. Very astute. Come on, Nomi, we're going chopping. Coming. No, no, no, that's not for you. Yes, it is. I'm scared. I'll get my gloves. - Come on, Casey. - Hurry up, Sammy. What about that one? Well, I don't know, you choose. Hey, how about this little guy? Yeah, sure, let's just hurry. Jesus, you guys. Guys. Hey, do you guys mind if I just take a minute here? Yeah. Do you want us to take the tree? No, it's fine, I'll be right in. - Here, take this. - Thanks. - Enjoy. - Thank you. Hey. Sorry, it's just me. As if that's somehow better. Goddamn it, Max. I just came out to help you with the tree. My hero. What is that? All right. How was the drive? Thomas DJ'd, which meant the ride felt like the world's saddest suicide pact, and he drives like an asshole. Well, I'm surprised you kept him sober long enough to sit upright without incident. Me, too. Hey, did you guys see the splattered deer on the way up? No, it sounds gnarly. We assumed you must've hit it. Well, unlike you, our driver was sober. Well, mostly. Oh, Nomi, dear, don't stay out in the dark with a boy. What will the neighbors think? Here, grab an end. I got it. Is it cold? Freezing. To tell you the truth, giving me nightmares. Oh, there it is. In case you two decide to come up for air. Hey, sis. Tommy. Hey, what is that? Let me have some. Hey, sis, thank you so much for inviting me. I didn't wanna spend Christmas with Mom or Dad. Yeah, of course. I just wish you had given me a bit more warning- - I really appreciate it. So, how did the chit chat go? Really well, actually. Hey, you guys wanna help with supper? Yeah, sure. I will help eat it. Yes? Yeah, I'll get the pizza. There's wine over there. Can we have both? Yeah. It was the drunkest I've seen Sam. No, that was the punch. Ooh, wait, wait, wait! Did you guys know that when we were kids, Thomas used to smell Samantha's hairbrus every time she slept over? - What? - I remember that. I caught you, I caught you. Oh my God, just shut up! It's cute. You were so weird. Still. I used to tell Nomi to hide my stuff. I was 10. Okay, but, you know, when we were kids, Nomi used to pee behind the couch. I never stopped. I used to love sleeping over at your parents' house. They never noticed whenever we'd sneak booze in the basement in high school. Or they'd pretend not to, yet they would always tear out my ass for smoking pot, which I didn't. It was always you and Thomas. Oh, come on, there's no way Graham or Leann would ever be mad at me. Yeah, that's on Casey. She made me. As if, as if! You were always there just in case Sam was. What, that's not true! You tortured me! Oh, no, as your honorary sister, that was my job. As your real sister, I took so much shit for you. The both of you. Well, I guess we can't all be Saint Sammy. Damn right you can't. Ooh, damn! Aw, well, Mom and Dad aren't here, thank Christ, so let's just all let loose. Thank you all for skipping out on your collective families to be here. Cheers. And thank you for having us. Yeah, thanks for having me on on your little family here. - Can I? - Oh yeah. Since when do you smoke? Does it matter. Yeah, take that out of your mouth. Do you know he smokes? He doesn't really. Even if I did, chill. I've seen you smoke. Little Tommy's in trouble. No, you're right, I'm sorry. Thanks. Come on, guys, I thought this was supposed to be a parent-free Christmas. Yeah, well, it isn't a drug-free Christmas, so I say we roll a joint and deck the halls. Hear, hear. Oh, that reminds me, I'll be right back. Was that night fun, though, Max? Can you pass me a light? Oh my God, always forgetting with these matches. And all he was asking for was a light. And Tom- - Who wants to help me decorate the tree? Ooh, me! - You like? - Don't! You're ruining the length. Yeah, but- - Can you please just stick to hanging things? Okay. I'm usually the designated driver. I mean, like, I know how to hold my liquor. Like this one time, I literally drank a whole case of beer, and then I drove Nomi home on a snowmobile. So what you're saying is that alcohol doesn't impair your judgment? Well, I wouldn't say that. Now I can't hold my liquor. Thanks, dick. - Let's get you another drink. - Okay. Let me hang that for you. Can I finally prove my worth and hang an ornament tended to by my sweet's fair hand? Come on, Sammy, lighten up. I mean, you don't wanna end up on the naughty list, do you? Maybe I do. Jesus, can you guys go in like any other room? Can you like spend Christmas with any other family? Can you like shut the fuck up? Whoa, hey! Nick, why are you even here? Whoa, okay, everyone needs to chill out. Casey, come on. Nah, I'm good. It was a joke. I'm sorry. Thank you. I just popped the head off the little guy. - Aw. - Here. I guess it's true what they say, you are good at giving head. Oh, you cheeky fucker. At least, that's what Nomi tells me. Whoa. Ah, this old chestnut. Wait a minute, what? It's nothing. Oh, it doesn't sound like nothing. Casey and I used to date, it's no big deal. But do you guys wanna prove it? This is exactly why I hate when it comes up. Thanks a lot, Max. I thought everybody knew. Yeah, but it's not a punchline. I'm sorry, I meant it as a compliment in the least. Yeah, the very least. Max can't help himself. He gets really excited when he hears that someone might be able to please a woman. I think we're going to go to bed. No, no, but let's just finish the tree. Things are fine. We'd love to, in the morning. Maybe when everyone is a little more festive mood. Come on, Sam, please? Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna hit the hay, too, okay? I'll help you finish the tree tomorrow. Okay. Goodnight, sis, love ya. Yeah, Merry Christmas. You dick! Congratulations, Max. I'm sorry, I was trying to be funny. Oh, right, 'cause that's always been your strong suit. Yeah, almost as strong as my ability to please a woman. Goodnight, Max. Think it was planned, dude? Don't you fucking start. Fuck off, gingerbread. Fuck you. Fuck! You're so beautiful, Sam. I love you. I love you. I love you, too. Thanks for standing up for me today. Of course, always. Sorry we didn't get to decorate your tree. It's okay. It'll be better tomorrow. Yeah. Goodnight, Nomi. Goodnight. Hey. I just really wanna tell you I'm sorry about earlier. Come on, please, I know it was shitty. Do you mean tonight or do you mean classically? Both. I don't have to keep forgiving you. I know, but I'd love it if you could just one last time. Why, so you can just disappoint me in some other grand manner? Do you need me to apologize for your parents' divorce again? I don't need you to apologize for my parents' divorce. I need you to apologize for absolutely dropping the ball in supporting me through it. I didn't know how to help you! Shh! You didn't know how to sit there and listen? No, you know what, you were just too goddamn sad, okay? Well, excuse me, I guess Thomas wasn't too sad for you to sit around and play video games the entire time, though. Well, I certainly wasn't fucking Thomas. At that point, he weren't fucking me either. Shush! Do you think we'll wake up Nick? Of course not, he'd dead to the world. Do you have? Stay right there. Is that a fresh box of condoms? I sure as hell hope so. Are you serious? Excuse me? You bought a fresh box of condoms? Like, you didn't have one in your wallet. You actually planned this? Well, no, no, no, no. I just wanted to be prepared. In case I threw myself at you. Jesus, Max, you make it impossible to love you. Come on. - Nomi, please, Nomi! - Goodnight, Max. Leave me alone. Leave me alone! Please, just leave me alone! Nomi, are you okay? Oh my God, oh my God, I'm so happy to see you. What are you doing in here? I guess I must've fallen asleep. What time is it? Like seven. Do you want anything for breakfast? Yeah, yeah, maybe. Hey, man. Hello, sweetpea. - You want some eggs? - Sure. Cool. Tommy, can I crash in your bed for a bit? I did not get any sleep last night. Yeah, for sure. Thank you. I, uh, go to bed. Yeah, good. - Hey. - Hey. - Good morning. - Good morning. - You want some eggs? - Yes, please. - Nomi? - Yeah, maybe. I might just make some scrambled pizza. - Okay. - Ooh, I want that. I'm gonna shred some cheese. What's an eight-letter word for obnoxious? Nicholas. I did not say an eight-letter word for hung as hell. Jesus. Oh my God, Sam. Oh, no, it's a stillborn. This does count for something, though, right? Actually, both. So that's 15, two, and take that to four and run this eight. Sorry, babe. Hey, you guys wanna finish the tree? Well, yeah, maybe in a little bit, but we were gonna go play in the snow. Okay, well, do you wanna finish it when Casey wakes up? Yeah, that sounds good. Sure. I'm gonna go get changed. Okay, right behind you. Goddamn it. What are you looking for? My gloves. I was gonna go outside. Hey, do you guys mind if I borrow a pair from here? Yeah, go ahead. Sweet. Ooh. See you later. This is The Wolf, coming at you on TWPS for another hour of smooth, smooth tunes. May they soothe your weary soul and keep the beasts at bay. - Perfect. - Now, whether you're doing some last minute shopping or trimming the tree, here's a little number to get your afternoon started. Hey. Hey. Where are you two off to? We're gonna go build a snowman. Oh, sounds fun, can I come? I don't think so, three's a crowd. Of course. Well, you two have fun. Bye. - Morning! - Oh, hey, morning. You didn't come back to bed last night. Is there something you wanna tell me? Oh, Christ, no, what a mess. Oh, God, okay, now you have to tell me. He bought a fresh box of condoms. Did you sleep with him? No, no. Yeah, well, you can't blame the guy for trying. Well, I can. Mm mm, don't eat those, they're bad. They tasted fine to me. Hey, no, scoot your boot, I'm doing those. Thanks. So do you think you and Max are done then? I guess, he's impossible. Good looking. Well, yeah. Hey, do you mind if I just take a nap while it's quiet. I fell asleep in the tub, and my neck's really stiff. Of course. Let's finish the tree when Sam and Tommy get back. Sure thing. Go to bed. It may not look it, but it's another brisk one today, folks. Seems that despite these frosty prairie temperatures, we've been having a relatively dry winter, but make sure to bundle up because we're looking at minus 30 throughout the night. Now, here's a tune to curl up in front of the fireplace to. Stay toasty, dear listeners. Oh my God, I am so sorry! It's fine, it's okay. Poor little guy. I think we did a great job. Yeah, even without the tip of his nose. Did you hear that? What? I thought I heard something. It was probably just a deer. You cold? Yeah, yeah, let's head back. Sure. Nomi, wake up! If you don't get up, I'm gonna have really loud sex with your brother tonight. Oh my God, Sam, you weirdo! I'm awake! This is so good. Come here, come here, try this. Okay. Mm, yeah, that is good. Mm hmm. What do you have? That's not a bad hand, actually. Okay, where's Nick? Probably terrorizing the local wildlife? Well, we probably shouldn't eat without him. Well, it's gonna take a few hours, so, if he's not back by the time it's done, he's dead. Oh, ooh, hey, who wants to have a fire while we wait for supper? Yes, that sounds amazing! Yes, yes! Babe? I'm still a little bit chilly, so I'm gonna go take a bath. No! I'll come join you guys after. Okay. Yeah, we'll join, too, when we're done - prepping dinner. - Yeah. That's okay, Nomi and I can go start the fire. Yeah. I'll help out with dinner when I get out of the tub. We'll start the oven. - Come on, sis. - I'm coming. Do you mind passing me the wine? Thank you. Hey, look, it's Mom. Aw, she must've left this before we were born. Your hands are like the same size. My hands are the same size. Why? You think Mom's upset that we're not spending Christmas with her? Yeah, probably. Have you talked to Dad recently? Yeah, a few days ago. He asked us to reconsider. These won't do. They're all wet from the snow. Why didn't you tell me Dad called? I'm not an answering service. Plus, you said you wanted to come with me. No, I know. I know, I didn't wanna go. Besides, Stephanie probably would've been there, anyway. Fucking sucks. Hey, look, let's just not mention her, or Mom or Dad, okay? Well, why don't you ever wanna talk to me about it? Tommy, I've talked to you about it to death, okay? I just need a break from it. Mom calls me nonstop, and then Dad just drops by, so they can complain about each other to me. Yeah, but every time I bring it up, you change the subject. Thomas, seriously, just drop it, okay? Fine. Okay, why don't you call them then? If you wanna talk about it so badly, then you can be the one to listen to their shit for once. You know, maybe you should've brought a big wooden cross with you. Maybe then your stay would've been a little more comfortable. Well, maybe you should get in the car and leave then. Where the hell are you going? To find more wood! Tommy! Hello? Tommy? Is that you? Hello? Jesus, what the fuck are you doing out here? I don't know. I went to hike, and then I lost track of time. I got pretty spooked. It's really creepy out there. Little bit. And truth be told, I am a little stoned. Do you want some? No, thanks. I gotta go find fucking Thomas. Out there? Yeah. Oh. Take this. Oh, thanks. Hey, can you go get the others, and get the fire going? I'll be back in a little bit. Mm hmm, good. Thanks for your help. Yeah, no problem. So, I guess Nomi must've said something earlier. Only that it was a mess and that it was over. Sounds about right. And how do you feel about that? Well, things could be worse. Is that so? I think so. Me, too. Hey, I'm gonna go dry my hair, and I'll be right out to help. Yeah, sure thing. Whoops. Hey. So Nomi is looking for Tommy out in the woods. So, you guys put your jackets on, and go start the fire. I'm cold as fuck, so I'm not gonna do it. Yeah, where is Thomas? I don't know, looking for wood or something. Yeah, sure, come on, Casey. Okay, let's get this started. Or we can take this opportunity to get something else started. Maximilian, you dog. I don't hear you protesting. Nomi! Nomi, are you around? Nomi. I guess not. The only place on Earth not covered over by the last Ice Age. Makes you think, doesn't it? Maybe there's another one around the corner. Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Where are you? Tommy, quit fucking around. Thomas! Where are you? Did you get lost? I'm over here! Is that you? Bring me that flashlight. Tommy, can you please stop being stupid and come back to the cabin with me? Here, grab some of these? How did you even see out here? Well, I had this stick that I lit, but I dropped it. Okay, well, I'm glad you're done having a pout. Hey, I'm not having a pout. Tommy! Tommy! Help me, don't let go! Oh my God, Tommy! Help me! Oh, God! Nomi, what the hell? Nomi! - Oh, help! - Tommy, Tommy! Nomi! Tommy! Oh my God! Oh, Jesus, oh my God! Oh my God, get up, get up! - The wolf! - Casey! What is that? - Huh? - What was that? Shh, shh, shh! It's Nomi, it's Nomi! - I think it's Nomi. - Shit! Nomi! Nomi, Nomi, where are you, where are you? Tommy, Tommy! Nomi, Nomi! - Help! - Shit. Tommy! I'm sorry. - Sammy. - No! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Hey, you gotta stay with us, okay? We have to take a look at your arm now. Nick, go get some scissors and a sewing kit. - Where is- - Now, Nicholas! Please, please. Let me see that gauze. Tom. Okay. Am I going to die? No, babe, no. You're gonna be just fine. Look at me, look at me. I promise. - Tommy! - Okay? It's okay. I have to go check on Thomas. Wait, Nomi! - Yeah? - Nomi, Nomi, are you okay? Tommy! I need you to hold him still, Nick. I don't know if I can. Nick, come on! This is bad, this is bad. - Nick? - Holy fuck. No, no. Don't look. Is it bad? Tommy! Sis! Hey, sunshine. Hey, hey, I want you to look at me, all right? - Okay. - Okay. You're gonna be all right. - You're gonna be all right. - You promise? I promise. I promise, okay? Okay, okay. Deep breath. Remember to breathe. It's gonna be all right. Okay. It hurts. Breathe in, then breathe out. Good, breathe. Inhale. - No, no. - Just breathe, just breathe. - No, no! - Look at me. I can't. Holy shit! Fuck! Keep him company. Nick. Tommy, here, here, here. Take these, okay? - I'm gonna get you some water. - Okay. We've got to get him to a hospital. Get him in the car or- - We cannot go back out there. We'll all be ripped to shreds, okay? Let me call someone. Oh, oh. Come here. I didn't want this to happen. I'm gonna fix it. You're gonna be okay, I promise. I promise. I need your help. It's okay, it's okay. Casey, take this to Thomas. Sit down. No, no, I need to call someone. Are all the doors locked? Yes, I locked all the doors. Now just sit down and put your foot up. No, I have to help Thomas! Samantha is helping Thomas. Just sit! Casey, can you please come try the phone? Yeah, I'm coming! Wait, what the fuck is this, an owl? It's dead. - It's dead. - What do you mean? - What do you mean it's dead? - No, no, no. - No, no, no, no. - What do you mean, Casey? It's dead. - It's fucking dead. - Casey! Just fucking calm down! That is incredibly helpful, Max. What's going on with Thomas? Sam's got his arm wrapped up, and she's trying to get him to drink some water. Did you call 911? No, no, look at this! Hold on. I saw a radio, a radio earlier in the mud room! Have you ever used one of these before? Yeah, yeah, I used them when I hunted. Hello, is anyone out there? We're trapped in a cabin in Cypress, over. SOS, we are requesting assistance in Cypress. We have two wounded, over. God, please, is anyone there? Hello, this is Hank the Tank. What's going on, over? Hi, thank you, oh my God. We're trapped in a cabin at Cypress at the south end, where all the lots were sold, number 432. How many are you? You're the kids from town the other day, over? That's the creepy guy from the gas station. Well, creepy or no, we need help. Yes, there's six of us, and we have two wounded, over. What happened? We were attacked in the woods. We don't know what it was, but it wasn't anything we've ever seen before. Hello? You kids lock the doors and stay away form the windows. I'll be there as soon as I can. Keep this radio on, and do not go outside. I'll stay by the radio. You guys go check on Tommy. Come on, Nomi, we're going. No, come on, come on, move! Do you have any idea what attacked him? It wasn't an animal. So what was it? It was hungry. Jesus, fucking kids. It's cold as death outside tonight, and I can hear the wind whipping at the windows. Makes me shiver just thinking about it. Now, I've got a mug of hot chocolate and, between you and me there might be a drop of whisky in there to keep these bones warm through this chilly December night. Oh! Damn it, bitch! Come on! Come on! Shit, goddamn it! Shit! Is someone there? Jesus Christ. - Be careful! - Don't bump his arm. Got it, thanks. It's okay, it's okay. Okay, move, get out. Tommy. Oh my God. Okay, babe. Okay, are you okay? Sammy, I'm okay. Oh, Sammy. Oh, Sammy, Sammy. Will you take what's left of my hand in marriage? Tommy, that's not funny. Nomi. I'm here, I'm here. I'm sorry. You have nothing to be sorry for, sweetie. If anyone needs to be sorry, it's Nomi. Excuse me? You told him to leave before, I heard you. Sam, this isn't my fault. Can you please just leave us alone? Would you, please? Fuck! Idiot. Hey, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Hey, how are you holding up? Is there anything worse than bad? I just feel like such shit. Well, there's nothing we can do about it now. Yes, thank you. Casey, I'm sorry. No. It's me that's sorry. I don't know why I always do this. I'm surprised she even still speaks to me. Is anybody there? Who's here? Is that Hank? - Let's let him in. - Hurry. No, don't! What the hell's wrong with you? Please, Nick, Nick, no, man, just wait. Come on. What the fuck? Stop, please. Let me in. Hey, can I ask you a quick question first? I'm scared. What did me and my friend buy yesterday? Please, man, just tell me. Wait. There's something outside the bathroom window. It was just outside the door. Nomi, it spoke to us. - Max. - What? Go let Thomas and Samantha know to turn off the lights and stay away from the window, right now. Yep. Thank you. I don't wanna alarm you, but whatever is outside is circling the cabin. I'm going to turn off this lamp, and I'm gonna need you to come out and be with us. There's no way I'm leaving him in here. We'll move him to the mud room. He'll be closer to everyone there. Okay, okay, just go get Nick. I can do it, I can walk. Sure you can, but I'm just gonna help, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Hey, hey, hey, you need to have a glass of water, okay? Yeah, he'll be fine for a few minutes. Careful, careful, careful. You guys take such good care of me. Hey, hey. I know it's not your fault. I love you, sis. I love you, too. I'm gonna be okay, right? You promised it would be so. I have to be, right? How's your hand? Okay. I'll come check on you in a little bit. Hey. Hi. I love you. I love you the most, Sammy. I think you need a little break from bedside duty. Yeah, but- - No, no, babe, they're right. You deserve the rest. Oh, okay. Here you go, buddy, drink up. It'll help with the pain. Thanks. Ow. Well, you're gonna play like shit this year. And I'll still be better than you. Oh, hey, man, if you die, I promise I'll still take care of Sam. Dude, I'll fucking haunt you. It's better this way, close your eyes. - Okay. - Let it go, so peaceful. Shh, shh, shh. Dude, stop, don't encourage him. Goodnight, sweet prince. Stop it. Hey, man, listen, and I really mean this, if it had to be anybody, I'm just glad it wasn't me. Oh, fuck off. No, no, no, it's okay, man. We got someone coming. Really? Yeah. And, while we wait, we can all sit around and watch Nomi tear my ass out for sleeping with Casey. Jesus Christ. Max, I swear to God, when we get out of here, I'm gonna punch you in the fucking mouth with the four fingers I have left. That's fair. Yeah, fair. Okay. Fucking cheers. Fuck yeah. Hey, luckily we got ahold of that guy, right? I mean, like, we really could've been fucked here, you know? Well, one of us was fucked here tonight. Hey, you doing okay? Yes, Casey, I'm fine. Get out. Get out! I don't think he's coming. Okay, then, what should we do? We have to get Thomas to a car. - No. - No! No one is coming. We call someone else, come on- - I've been trying all night. There's no one. Then I should go get the car. I'll go, he's my baby brother. And I should go because it's my fault, right? That's what you're thinking? It is your fault! Samantha! She told him to leave, and he did, and now he might die. This is your fucking fault! You need to back off! No one did this. It's all right, okay? Let's get you back to Tommy, all right? Okay. I'll go. Why? Because I should. And because I don't have a mangled leg. If anything happens, I'll come for you. Okay? Okay, and the keys? Here, you'll need this. Oh, fuck! What? Oh my God. The keys, they must've fallen out in the woods. What? Oh, shit. Here, here, you'll have to try the other car. Okay, okay. I'll get your jacket. No, it's just gonna slow me down. Casey, you'll freeze to death, take it. All right. Let's do this. Don't look back, Casey. Run, Casey, run! Come on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Come on, come on, come on. She's in the car, what is she doing? It won't start. My time's nearly coming to a close, my friends. Thank you for spending your holiday - with me. - Did you leave the car unplugged? Nick! I have a few more songs to carry us through this final magical hour of our program, so stay tuned. What in the fuck, Nick? I wasn't thinking. And now what? Well, I could ask you the same thing. I'm closing the door. No, no, what about Casey? Don't fucking touch me. What about us? Sam, there's no way I could've known. Please, don't do this, Sam, please. Sam, Sam, please. There's no way I could've known! How was I supposed to know? You're his stupid fucking best friend! Sam, is that you? It's Nomi. Hey, sis. Hey. I'm sorry. How are you doing? All right, I think I want everyone to stop asking me that. Yeah, I guess I sound like Mom, eh? No, you're not complaining about me ruining the towels. Is Casey okay? I'm gonna get her, and then I'm gonna get you out of here, okay? I promise. What would we do without you? Can you turn the light off on your way out? Of course. Sam. Nomi, I'm so scared. Me, too. Move. What are you gonna do? We're gonna go help Casey, asshole. What's the plan? Distraction. Good a plan as any. With any luck, whatever it is isn't around. Oh, really? Well, listeners, this is The Wolf signing off to howl at that big, beautiful Christmas moon. Let this Yuletide classic enchant you. And I wish you all the happiest of holidays. No, goddamn it, come on! No, no, no. You're okay, you'll be okay. Somebody was fucked here tonight. Oh my God. Casey. Okay, we have to hurry. Pass me that pot and spoon. Help me, help me, please, somebody come and help me! Casey! Come on. Did you see that thing? Of course I did! What the fuck, Nick? Thanks for killing the fucking car! I'm sorry, I'm glad you're okay. Yeah, no thanks to you. That creature almost killed me. Yeah, I know! I get it. Fuck. Thank you. Yeah, I'm fine, thank you. Nomi, Thomas is delirious. I tried calling on the radio, but no one is answering. Okay, okay, I'll figure this out. Just keep him company, okay? Guys, look, I know that this is a lot to ask, but we have to go find the other keys. Tommy really needs our help, and we all have to get out of here. No, I'm not going back out there. Come on, Casey. No, I'm sorry, but I'm not! You shouldn't have made her go out there in the first place. Nick, don't start! Can I talk to you in the kitchen? Oh, sure. We have to go find the other keys, without Casey. Yes, I obviously realize this. Of course, but let's talk game plan here. The more of us with weapons, the better. No, no, don't be hasty. Listen to me. Nick has been a fuck up since the word "go" tonight. He's not reliable, he's a detriment. Mm hmm. And we also have him to thank for Casey's refusal. We can't take Samantha. She's gotta look after Thomas. Looks like it's just you and me. Now we can't just fly out there blind. We need to sit tight and make a plan. Max, we don't have the luxury of writing up schematics and setting bobby traps. We have to go now. No, Thomas is my best friend. I am not going to let anything else happen to him tonight. We need to get as many people as we can to distract it. I can go convince Casey that she can do at least that. Yes, maybe she'll listen to you now since you're so fucking close. Nomi, we don't have time for this. Oh, but we have the time for your bullshit. Oh, you fuck. Fuck! We have to get moving. I don't think we're ready. Max, we're never gonna be ready, okay? Come on. Fuck. I'm not going out onto the porch, but I'll stand at the door. Whatever, just help, okay? Okay. Hey. Hey, Tommy's asking for you. Okay. Hey, Tommy. I'm so happy to see you. What's going on? I just wanna know when we're leaving. I forgot your present at home. I'm so sorry. It's all right. I shouldn't have brought you. I should've just left you with Mom. Honey, just lay still, okay? Okay, okay. Sweetie, I need you to sit up, okay? No! Sam, Sam! What happened? Oh my God, we need some gauze. What's happening, what's happening? It's nothing, sweetie, it's gonna be fine, okay? We just need to re-bandage your arm. Drink this, here. Oh, Tommy. Tommy. - Oh, Nomi, I don't feel good. - Tommy, okay, okay. - Thomas. - I don't feel good. Thomas, I need you to look at me right now, okay? I need you to stay awake, okay? - Okay, Nomi. - Okay. - Look at me. - I want to see what happens. Okay. - What do you say? - Okay. I'm just gonna wrap some gauze, okay? - Hold on. - My favorite nurse. Oh! Sam, just kiss me. Just kiss me, just kiss me. No. Nomi, what's going on? Can you get everyone ready to fucking help? Let's go. Give me a second. Tommy? Tommy! Tommy. - Thomas. - No, no, Tommy! - Tommy. - Tommy, you need to wake up. No, no, no! No! Tommy, you need to wake up. - No, no, no! - You need to wake up. No, Tommy! No, no, no, please, wake up, please, please, wake up! No, no, no, please. Wake up. Get out, get the fuck out! Sammy, we need to go, we have to get out of here. You have to come with me. We need to go. No. Samantha, please. No. No. Sam, you have to come with me. You have to, come on! I'm not gonna go with you so you can kill me, too. I didn't... Oh my God, oh my God. We've gotta do something, right? We can call for help. Just let me help you. I need you to let me help you. Nomi, listen. Nomi. Nomi! Jesus Christ. You aren't gonna take anything else from me! Nomi, no, Nomi! Nomi! Nomi. Nomi. Nomi. Nomi. Nomi. Nomi. Nomi. Nomi. Nomi! Is it dead? Nomi? Nomi? You fucking, fucking! Fuck you!
