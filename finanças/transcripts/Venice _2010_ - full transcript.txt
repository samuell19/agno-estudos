VENICE This is our lot: Spring 1939 Here today gone tomorrow! Such a lot God grants to me, Unaware where my grave will be! Your best left foot forward! How superb our look Steel glittering in the sun The horse tears the soil, spooked: You'll gallop, gallop far. This is our lot: Here today gone tomorrow! Such a lot God grants to me, Unaware where my grave will be! Guard, attack, move away! Guard, attack, move away! Guard, attack,... etc. ,... Who let you take off the mask?! Soldier! Soldier! Get back in line! My defender of homeland! You asked me to come over and here I am. Father headmaster couldn't say what's up... I wanted to see you. Kidding? That's why I've schlepped for 300 miles? I just wanted to see you. All right. Father called from Rumania. Will be back in a month. Next we may be off to Venice. Together? Yeah... Things are OK between us. None of your business anyway. No. My question: Who's going to Venice? Everybody's been there but me: You, Dad, Victor, aunts... We'll take Victor along. You have school. He does too. He's 3 years your senior... Mom, don't you know how much I want to go to Venice? And you will. The time will come. It's not enough to love Venice. She has to be understood. And yours is a kid's head... clueless about what matters in life, how the future should be mapped out... not to end up disappointed. Does Victor know? Much better than you. His school is hard too. Father with his nose to the grindstone... I'm not complaining, Mom. A speech in the offing? I know the names of all the squares and churches in Venice... How the town was built... I can say all the most important dates... Please... I'll talk to Father, but I don't see a chance... - Please. - I said I'd talk. Hello. Lunch in 1 0 minutes. So you see... We've had a talk... I've left the church open. The last night for your slips of paper. I'll have a beautiful and long life. A lot will happen in it, but travels will be the most important. I'll travel very far all over the world: Europe, Africa, Asia... I'll get to know people, miss Mom and bring her exotic presents from my expeditions. But a trip to Venice will be the most important. I'll go there soon, have pistachio ice cream at Campielo del Milion. And next to Murano on a gondola for Venetian medallions for Mom, Granny... and maybe for someone. I'll never forget Poland and my parents. I'll win fame for my country in the first place and the people I love to make them proud of me. And the most important thing I haven't mentioned yet... It's... love. It's very hard to find, but I'll love and will be loved. And I'll learn to talk about love, which I can't yet. It helps in life a great deal... Piazza de San Marco. Campiello del Palazo Real adello. You're late. How's the weather in Venice? You're late. Everybody's gone already. Soldiers stopped us on the way. Some kind of exercise... We aren't going? Tell me, Dad. We aren't going, yes? We'll go to Pochajczyk, to Aunt Veronica. There's water there too... Yes, and towers, Venetian windows and pigs and rats... Aunt is very brave. She tries to maintain the palace for the whole family. - For you too... - I don't want to be there. Well, yes, but... you'll have to want to... Maybe we should ignore what's in the papers? You also deserve a rest. And Venice is not the same as Pochajczyk or Stawczany. You claim that Veronica spoils Victor and Marek, letting them walk all over herself... Veronica is crazy, but she's my sister and a good woman. If not Venice, then Pochajczyk for sure. It's safe... and far away. Far away from what? From stupid things. Why, you do stupid things no more, right? Mrs. Veronica! Do you see it? I've almost mastered the dance with the bottle. It's coming out well... I see it, Naumek. Very good. Lovely... But take a look. It's a very difficult Jewish dance. I see, Naumek. A very difficult Jewish dance. Very difficult. If you don't believe me... try to do it someday. Yes, yes. Someday. For sure? Certainly. I'll try someday. For sure. Marek, how you've grown! He has. Seweryn suggests that we enlist him in the cavalry. Better not in the cavalry. It's no laughing matter. Will you, master, play with the doll or help me? So much cleaning to do and it's going to rain tonight... Shove that master and the rain too! It's not going to rain at all! Don't be so menacing and zip your... cage, or the bird will fly out. Don't be angry about the joke. Name's Frosia. Madam's new daily from the village. I'm right about the rain. A regular downpour. No rain at all! No rain at all! Susie... I know... I've grown. You left it in the tent. I wasn't supposed to come this year. Dad's gone to the army. Mine too. Your aunt allows me to come here. Our generation, seasoned to wars, certainly deserves peace. But peace, as almost all matters of this world, comes at a price. High but measurable. In Poland, we don't know peace at all costs. - What's happening? - A lot and no good... But what? Don't forget to drive to the station. Barbara and Karolina should be brought here. The old lady may come too... And Aunt Klaudyna? She stays in Sopot, but sends Karolina with her Czech governess. Hey, hey, the host's coming. Gotten up at last? - It's almost noon. - If he sleeps till noon, he'll let important things slip. Important things? Yeah? Quarrels again like last year? They quarreled with Susie? I have the feeling they'll fall in love this year... Yeah, sure... Will I find out at last? Look... Look... Soldiers taking a rest. Nothing interesting. Would there were no war. See to it. No war whatsoever, you hear?! Frosia! Thank God, you're all here. And Klaudyna and Roman... Thanks. - Going somewhere? - Why? - You aren't? - Well, maybe I will. The White Cross has summoned me. I don't want to be here! I don't... I don't want to be here! I don't want to be here! I don't! Eat! Sit down, Joanna. Veronica will collect them. Excuse me, but I must be going. The chauffeur's waiting for me. - Joanna's leaving? - Yes, she is. The White Cross... is a moral obligation. Remember, you're the only man in the house until Victor arrives... Is this... all? So this is a war. As of today, all matters and problems recede into the background. Our entire public and private life is put on a side track. We've entered the war. The entire effort of the nation must go in one direction. We are all soldiers and have to think of one aim - to fight till we win. Marek! Marek! Marek! Where have you been, stupid? We've been worried about you! Mom will soon be back, right? Of course, she will. And we'll go to Venice? Jesus, you have a fever. Hmm... mineral water. A bit salty, but tasty. Seweryn was right. We should've kept the boarding house. The Iungs and bronchi are clean. Must've caught a cold and... the emotions. Hence the fever. Will be up and around after 3 days in bed. Like I said. Swiss waters are the real thing. They're sweet, no mineral salts whatsoever. Zurich, Bern... And those landscapes and views... Whereas with us just Marianske Lazne. Waters... water, water... As if there was nothing else to worry about. What're you doing, child? The Jews have many diseases and no... hygiene. Here. Mineral anyone? Ma'am, ma'am! We slept two nights in the field. I ran away from an air raid... This is a real war... And I had to, by myself... across Polesie, side roads... Indescribable those... buses, trains... the wounded, corpses... Nobody knew... what to do. No command... you were left to your own devices. Poland has not perished yet So long as we still live. That which foreign force has seized We at swordpoint shall retrieve. Dad! How do we win this war... That's the way the war is... A Czech colonel... A Czech colonel?! Or maybe a general! Why, there are different wars... the most disparate... Eat a lot of garlic. It calms you down. - I've put kielbasa in... - Joanna's not here? ... some eggs, a bottle of raspberry juice... whatever there was. - Can you the Gypsy way? - What Gypsy way? Oh, stupid... To smoke like a Gypsy. I can't. How do you do it? Soldiers returning from the war. - Has Poland lost? - Who knows... One's afraid to ask... They are so tired. Heads low, they just stomp their feet... - How can I see it? - What for? Just to see. Don't let PerIman bleed us white, OK? Sure, sure. Not a word about the water in the basement. We need no pilgrimages to flock here. This is for Naumek... plum cake. Fire! Fire, man! I don't want to be here! Aunt, do you see it? I do... Venice. This pier must be the strongest, as concerts will be held here. We'll seat Granny here, Mom here, and here the aunts. Our Venice will be beautiful. You'll see. Mom! Well, admirable indeed. This must be Zoppot. as in a view card. Come on, Mom. What Zoppot? It's Venice. Don't you see? The table is San Marco. We'll put the piano on it, right, Lilian? Of course. The sound bounces off the water beautifully... My concert Beckstein in the basement? You've all gone crazy? Karolina, enough of that hard candy! The dentist will cost me a fortune! I got them! I've bought out all 24 of them from Seltzefand's. I don't get it why you're so mad. For a hundred reasons. Should I name one? Yes, please. Hands should be washed with soft soap before playing, or else the grime sticks to the keyboard. No more other soaps than the soft kind. I've squirreled away 3 bath soap bars. Good Czech soap. If someone wants it, she can have it. The soap's not the point... Klaudyna's world of banquets and balls for the high brass has just collapsed. Hence she's so touchy. You're right, dear... My general of a fiance left me within 3 minutes, in such a hurry for the war. I somehow managed to schlep here... by train. You're right, Babs, but I pity you. Just look at yourselves. Veronica runs naked at dawn... In panties and tall grass. You can't see a thing. The point is to be healthy and the cold dew. In Czechoslovakia, thousands jog barefoot mornings. A Venice in the basement. And you wonder why I'm mad? But we have a world of our own here, Klaudyna. Long for anything, but don't ruin our yearnings. Your elegance posture doesn't give you the right to... Yeah, right, it gives me no right, but when I see Lilian bring up my daughter to be an idiot... How can you? An idiot?! Her French is perfect, politeness, cleanliness and behavior commendable... How can you?! I'm sorry, Lilian... I didn't mean it. I know: a slip of tongue. You don't think that way... Latek, say hello to our elegant lady. Naumek... Some hard candy? You played beautifully... Time 1 /60 seconds. Shutter between 4 and 5/6. I've put the red 23 A filter. Bravo. The sky will take on a poetic appearance. Yes. - Good choice. - Thank you. A little more vigor. Smile... clearly. Fetch me lens 90, please. One moment. He wouldn't give his violin... Said he'd rather die. Somebody say that we give them no choice... - Here. - Thank you. Would that were not true... Where's Naumek, Mr. PerIman? Naumek is no more. He wouldn't give an officer his violin and... he's no more. Mom! You were right... The piano should stand on San Marco. After all Venice is Venice, yes? I know... You'll freeze. That's what winter is for. But not to spend it in bed, sick. You worry about me, Aunt? Of course, I do... About you and Victor. He vanishes for days... Neither Mom nor Dad sends a word. Is this the way it should be? No... but there's a war on. Luckily, you're safe here... and the parents have no cause to worry. But the war won't last long, right? I don't know... Dad wrote us a letter. - From Russia? - From Ostashkovo. - Must be from Poland. - No, from Russia. From a Soviet camp. - Will he be back soon? - That he didn't write. But those Soviets will help him, right? I don't know. They may... Do they believe in God? The Soviets? I guess not... The Germans do, but look how bad they are. Make those Soviets help Dad. He has stomach ulcers and must eat light food. He is quite delicate and needs to be taken care of almost like a child. But those Soviets don't seem to know that. So make Dad simply tell them about it rather than sulk, embarrassed. And I promise never to break a windowpane, OK? Don't forget to ask around about Joanna. No news from her for over a month. I won't. And you don't forget to organize schooling for Victor and Marek. I already have some. No need to organize anything for me. Yes, yes, we know. Come back to us quick. I must leave, because Mom can't stay put for long. I have to attend clandestine classes in Warsaw anyway. So I'm leaving some candy for... Naumek. See to it that he takes it and tell him where I am, OK? If I had a little fuller bust... A dress for a Venetian carnival should be a perfect fit. Or I'll pad it with cotton wool a little. What do you think? That's right. You can pad it with cotton wool a bit. They must enlarge. It won't take long, I guess. I drink much milk now. I think it won't take long too. Till spring maybe... Till the carnival... I'll try all of them on. Your Granny let me do it. Run downstairs quick. Maybe Victor is back... Mom! - Where's everybody? - In church. Today's Sunday. Where's the piano? On the Piazza del San Marco in Venice. - Where? - In the basement, Mom. I got three letters from the oflag in Oranienburg. Father writes he's fine and misses us... Will you leave? I will but I'll return... Life takes different courses. You'll understand it someday. - When will you be back? - I'll often come over. When will you return and stay put? When the war is over. Meaning? For the carnival in Venice. All right? My dear carnival crowd. How do you like Venice? Your new gondolier is coming to you... with the new Recioto della Valpolicella wine, made of dried Corvina grapes. He has problems with mooring and your friend catches him. He pulls out the oars and me next. Of a light taste and fruity bouquet! We'll drink it from the Venetian Murano glass. I hope everyone is having a good time. Two sacks of sugar... when the times were good, and not sweet enough? Good evening. Continue playing. We'll listen with pleasure. A Venetian carnival... ... does not happen every day. I promised my wife to snap curiosities and send them to her in Berlin. Don't stop playing, please. Please continue. Come here, boy. I've snapped a Gypsy camp in the wood, - What's it called, Zaruba? - Tefillin. That's right, tefillin. A lot of snapshots. And now Venice in the basement. Not only for me and my wife. It'd be selfish. Men... I and my men... work for the Propaganda Ministry of the Reich. Newsreel... Films for the army... Better than chasing bandits in the woods. All right, go. You lovely maiden... Come I'll take your picture. What the hell?! A punch in the kisser if you move? The only language you understand?! All right, all right... Play. Play!!! Life in Warsaw is no more. Germans are everywhere... The movies or cafes? Pointless... I've missed your... nonsensical concerns... The winner is a creation that is lively, with a wavy line, to which folds, pleats, flounces, frills, tunics, etc. ,... add variety. And your lively figure? You still run barefoot in the dew? I do... How's your heart? Still 1 00 beats a minute? You mean romances? They were gone once the war was on. By the way, can we really love? I can. Didn't an academic professor happen to dump you? - No, he didn't. I left first. - Exactly. She may be right. Maybe we can't love like other women. Where are our men, then? I'm left with a ruined palace. Klaudyna's without her general. Babs's without a professor, and Joanna wavers from pillar to post. Let's find the guilty party. Oh, hello! Let's stage the play How the Selfish Mother Ruined the Emotional Life of Her Daughters. In four acts, of course. Of course... Let's throw in the part of Father... A klutz that married into wealth and died of distress. How long will we enjoy the pleasure of your company? For a longer time. No sincere love An era of lies, agony, wrongs... No one's oneself, it's time that controls, And cruel indifference around. Only the mother's heart always breathes with feeling Only the mother's heart knows well of everything. Can give a little warmth, understands every pain. When it stops beating for us It's hard to live, so hard. Only the mother's heart, etc... Where did you get it? A real one? No. Painted. May I see it? - You've been tailing me? - What do you think, huh? I know what you do and with... whom. But remember mum's the word. Come on, me? You crazy? Parabellum.9. A small bore in front, but a cannon size one in the back. Just for that snitch Zaruba. You'll kill him? My hand wouldn't even tremble. - Will you? - I can't. First the sentence of the underground court. You can't without it. But he can? He hasn't done anything wrong to us yet. All right. Gimme. Here. What? Drink it. Now everything must be done faster. Drink, smoke, and make crushes on boys... because there is a war on. We may die tomorrow... Of pneumonia... From this bathing. Aunt Veronica claims it strengthens the heart and body. What're you doing? Smoking. Don't you see? - Will you help me? - Maybe I'll light it. I'm waiting. Put it away. Have you ever kissed? - Of course. - With Marek? Come on! He's still a kid. - And you? - What? Have you kissed someone? Me? I don't know how to yet. Want me to show you? Here you are. Part your lips... a little. Now close your eyes. Good? Not bad for the first time. Beautiful... - You want it? - You mean it? Take it. I see you like it and I'm not so strongly attached to it. - Thanks. - You're welcome. It's warmer, no? No! No! No! Command of the 3rd District of the Home Army - Pochajczyk Verdict of the Underground Court For treason and acting to the detriment of the Polish State, the Underground Court of the 3rd district of the Home Army - Pochajczyk sentences Zaruba. Enough. I'm tired of your jokes. Up to here. - Sing me something. - Really? Yes. Let's dance, Zaruba. Quiet, quiet, Zaruba. Quiet I said. - Good night, Lieutenant. - Good night. A cold night. For treason and acting to the detriment of the Polish State... The Underground Court of the 3rd District of the Home Army... What're you doing? Victor! Victor! What're you doing? Stop it, Victor. I don't want to be here! I don't want to be here! I don't want to be here! Marek! Mom! Oh, God! God! And I'll live to hear Mom tell me, ''I love you son. '' It'll happen in Venice, or in the meadows over the San. Winter 1 945 Oh, Poles... lords... The backpack, Susie. Take care, Susie. And I'll marry Susie, as Granny thinks she'll grow to be a beautiful and wise woman. Subtitles by Jerzy Siemasz
