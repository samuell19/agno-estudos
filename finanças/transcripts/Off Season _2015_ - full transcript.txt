Of course she is. You're an islander, huh? Born and raised, five generations. Which means I actually got here late. What are you doing up at the farm, are you staying there? Maybe. It s so beautiful up here. It's a lot different. Everybody seems to know everybody's business whether you like it or not. What s your business? Ah-ha. Hey, you wanna go fishing, some time? Fishing? It's kinda late in the season for that, isn't it? They're still around. I caught a forty pounder last week. I would take you all the way up but I'm runnin' late. For you. It's down the road a piece, you can't miss it. Lena? Hey Sadie. Well, looks like your knee is better. Yup. Nice job. One shot! You wanna help me skin it? Ah, maybe. Maybe I'll just watch. Come on. Do you hunt a lot? Just little guys around the farm. Stuff that's a nuisance, mostly. Sorry little guy, but you just eat too many veggies. - Oh, whattya got there? - Daddy!

Just put the knife down, sweetheart. That's a nice job. You clean him up real good, okay? Put the hard brush to it. I know, I know. This all you got? Ah, yeah, I travel light. You never know when you might have pick up and go, you know? I wish I did know. See you later. I have a surprise for you. Hey! Lena! Welcome to the farm. Thank you so much. Kellen's been showing me around. Yeah. He's quite the host. I'm amazed by this property. Mmm-yeah. I never take it for granted. you didn't tell her about Susan's tree? I was a-saving that one for you. Susan was our first daughter. Ah-she was lost to the pond. She loved her chrysanthemums or "mummy's" as she'd say. "More mummy's for me mommy, please?!" Uh-I'm sorry. Oh, don't be. Those mums keep it lively around here. Well, I'm gonna-I'm gonna take Lena up to the house. Alright. Well I'm delighted you've decided to join us, Lena. And if you need anything, please let me know. This one doesn't pay that much attention to the details. Thank you so much, Becca, really from the bottom of my heart. Oh, stop it, run along. Enjoy your day off. He's gonna put you to work and you may not be thanking me so much. - Uh oh. - Ah. - Let's go. - Alright. See ya. Bye. You see, over there, that old oyster shack. Uhh... Bartholomew has been staying in there wi-with Sienna lately. How'd you get up here? - Devon gave me a ride. - Devon? Becca's cousin? - Yeah - Sheesh, guy's a character. So, ahh. Bartholomew works for you? He's been with me fifteen years. Ahh- But he's mostly on his own. Mowing fields, cutting down trees, he's real handy. Ah, also qu-quite the fisherman. What about Sienna? Sienna, she ahh- scalloper, just got her commercial license. Fall River. Oh. You know. So, alright, come on. Let's umm- So, this is where you'll be staying. Umm-your room is through the living room on the right. - I don't know what to say. - Okay Now, I can pay you uh, twenty an hour off the books. Umm- Now mo-most of these kids are leaving soon but there's plenty of work over the winter umm- and I can always use a good farm hand. This is really generous of you, Kellen. You'll work for it, trust me. Uhh-now go on. Go on inside. and uhh-you let me know if you need anything. Mor-more blankets or anything. Winter is definitely coming early this year. Now, it's nice to have a fresh face around. Uhh-Marge is your roommate, and uhh-They'll be back soon. Okay. Hey, I'm Marge. Hey umm-I'm Lena, you're new roommate. Really? I'm surprised Kellen would hire somebody new this late in the season. We're all leaving in a couple of weeks. I don't know, he made it seem like there was plenty of work, so- Yeah. I guess there's always plenty of work to do on a farm. ahh, I'm actually in the middle of laundry. Do you wanna come with? Yeah. Honestly, I'm a little surprised anyone would wanna come work up here. Why do you say that? That girl who went missing a few of months ago? Emily Backus? It was all over the news. Shit, yeah. I think I did hear about her. Yeah, that was here. That bed you were napping on earlier? That was Emily's bed. Fuck. There were searches, her parents came in from Indiana. I don't know, she was kind of wild so I guess it wasn't that surprising. The whole thing was just bizarre. She just never turned up. One of the other crew members, Jimbo, you'll meet him later. They were dating when she disappeared- honestly, I don't love the vibe of this whole farm. Kellen and his family are so weird. Have you met the couple that lives by the pond? So ready to get out of here. Sorry, maybe you'll love it here. Let's get out of here. - Hey, Marge. - James Guys, this is Lena, our new teammate and roommate. She's taking Emily's bed. Welcome, hi Lena. Hey. Welcome to our humble party abode. - Hi, I'm Cassie. - Nice to meet you. Zoe, nice to meet you. You guys think I-you took the words right out of my mouth. Cheers! Hey there, whatchya doin'? Fuck! - Sorry. - Come on now. No, no, wait, not in the face. We don't do that here. Just move it over. All right. - Jesus. - Sorry. I live over there, with Bartholomew. I'm Sienna. Lena. New blood, huh? What are you like, partying with them folks? - I'm staying up there. - Mmm. I met Becca in town and she offered me some work and a place to stay, so. That's handy. Yeah, she s sweet. Becca? Sweet? Well, I don't know, she don't like me too much. - Oh yeah? Why is that? - Yeah Well, I drive too fast, that's for one thing and she does not approve of me and Bartholomew, you know. They're pretty protective of my Bart around here. Doesn't sound so bad. Well I'm not an Islander, I'm from Fall River? Up by the trailer. And I don't think they really like the idea of me like splittin' the farm with him one day. Why do you wanna leave? It's ahh, It's kinda stuffy around here. - Really. - Yeah. Hey, you know umm-Becca's cousin though? What's his name? - Devon. - Devon Yeah, yeah. I know him from the docks. Oh you got a thing? - Oh yeah, ok. No that's cool. - Get outta here. No that's good, I mean, have fun but just, I'd say don't get too involved with the locals, you know? - Oh Yeah? - Yeah. Didn't you just tell me Bartholomew is an islander? Yeah, but that's like, That's mad love, baby. - Mad love. Okay. - Mhmm. Okay. I'm gonna go back in. But it was nice to meet you, you know, you seem cool. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. I said like, two words. Yeah, but I can tell, you know, instincts. I'll see you. Ahhhhhhh!!! No more seed for you, suckers. Morning, everybody. Morning, Kellen. I'm sure you've all met Lena by now. Morning, welcome aboard. Thanks. Ah, Listen, you've all been uh, doing a nice job and I know you're packin' up soon, so I've got some good news. Uhh, We're gonna do that pig roast Thursday. - Ooooo oooooo - Do not touch me. Come on. Half day of work then uhh-we'll meet up at the pit by the pond early afternoon. Sound good? - Right on, Kellen. - Yeah. Hey, how bout an easy day today, Kellen. Come on, you still wanna earn some money? Right? We're gonna clear brush, dig holes and we have to get that- Hey! Come on. We need to get it ready for the irrigation piping, okay? So, head on up there, everything you need is in the shed, and ah, have fun. So how long you been working for the Witherspoons? These harmless hicks? Long enough. Loved it that much, huh? It has been a magical experience. Well, it couldn't have been all bad. I heard you had a fling for yourself. Marge told me you were dating that girl. The one that went missing. Marge has a big mouth. We weren't dating, we were just hanging out. C'mon, let's go take care of the hay low. So what's you're deal, anyways? Lone woman wanders onto the farm in search of romance and intrigue? Ah, yeah, no. I'm just, you know. Soaking it all in. In case you're lookin', strong, charming-handsome. You know the seasons almost over and trying to find a woman in the wintertime is like trying to find a parking spot in the summertime either they're all taken or they're all handicapped. That's fucked up. It's true. So true. Hey, Sadie. Whatchya doin' up there? What did ya get? Nothing this time. I'm just going to feed the chickens. Wanna come? No, I've-I gotta work for your dad, sweetie. Maybe next time. You actually talk to her? I've been here for six months and I don't even know her name. Her name's Sadie. Sadie. Hey, Lena. Sienna. Come over for beers later. I got scallops, too. I'll see ya. What do you know about her? They pretty much keep to themselves. That's the friendliest I've ever seen her. You wanna go? No, I'm beat and that invite was definitely for you. - Wimp. - Trust me. Sadie! What are you doing? Why do they gotta load the darn thing so much! Here. Was that yoga stuff you were doin? Yeah, yoga stuff. Maybe you could show me some moves someday? Absolutely. You might wanna put those boots on. It's pretty mucky in there. Here piggy wiggies. Come and get it! Get it, get it good. Wanna see something really cool that I've never shown anybody? Sure. Follow me. C'mon, it's okay, I promise. Are you sure? Of course I'm sure. My daddy is the caretaker. Okay. Come on. Oh, Sadie? I can't see a thing. Just keep walking straight, come on. This must be Susan. She would've been my older sister. This is very beautiful. It must have taken you a long time. Yeah, well it is for my sister. Are you allowed to be down here? Allowed? My daddy's the caretaker. This is my place. It's my secret place. And I've never shown anyone before. Well it's an honor, Sadie. Thank you. You're sure it's okay? Mmm hmm. I turn off the alarms every single year. Who lives in this house? Some rich folks, they come here for two weeks in July The Richardson's. They have a little girl my age. You should see what kind of stuff they toss down here. Hey, let me help you. Let's see- Let me see. Do you like my secret place? So far. Good. Would you like me to put make-up on you? No. I think I'll go au natural today. But it looks very elegant on you, my dear. Is there a wizard behind that curtain? No, I wish there was a wizard. But it's just a bunch of their crap. It's cold in here. I have something for you. Is that Sienna's hat? No. Here. No, it's okay, I have this. No, take it. It's a gift. Thank you. See, I can be a lady, too. Aren't I magnificent? Don't I look beautiful? Well, of course you do darling but remember, beauty is only skin deep. What does that mean? It means that beauty is about you. It s about what's inside. So if it's all ugly on the inside you're gonna be ugly on the outside too. I don't want to be ugly. You aren't. And you're not gonna be, sweetie. Do you have any sisters? Only me. Perfect. Why is that perfect? Because I could've had one and you don't have any. So maybe you can be my older sister? If you wanted to. I'm in. Under one condition. What's that, Sadie? You promise to never ever come here without me. Promise? I promise. You can trust me. You showed! Come on in, darlin! - Have a seat. - Thanks. To new friends! Hell, yeah! Hey, did you want Marge to come tonight? Mmm, Not really. - What, you don't lik... - No, I just like get the impression she thinks she's better than me. You know? She didn't look me in the eye when we met. I got nothin' against her. I just- you look like a scrapper. - You do. Ye... - A scrapper, really? Uh huh. Wow, well maybe. I mean I guess that's what happens when your crazy mama raises you. Crazy? Yeah, well I mean, drunk is more like it, actually. Yeah she uh, hit the bottle pretty hard when my dad died. But hey, ah, where's this Bartholomew? When am I going to meet this mystery man of yours. Fishing. - Fishing? - Mm hmm. - Out there? - Yeah - Does he freeze... - Well he bundles up. His machine runs hot. You know, I saw that tree today in the field. Mmm-that's weird. I know, they bury their own around here. It happens. Oh, it's Bartholomew. Hey baby, catch anything? You know I never catch nothin. What ve you girls been getting into? Oh nothing. Couple beers, girl talk. - Don't let me stop the party. - Oh, we won't. Hey, I'm Lena. Bartholomew. Get outta here. - Good to see you. - Yeah, you, too. - I better go. - Yeah? Thanks for tonight. It was fun. Anytime, doll. You know where to find me. See ya. I got that bastard, I got that son of a bitch. Ahh! Way to go, Daddy! Easy on the language, sweetie. It was that peanut butter, wasn't it? You were sure right about that, babe. Eat the bacon, daddy. All right, eggs for you both. Here you go- and here you go. I'm so glad Lena's come. - She's a nice addition, huh? - Mm hmm. I like her a lot. Oh, I gotta take care of this before they come. - I wanna watch! - Come on No, no, no, Kel. Uh uh. He's been eatin' our chickens! Pleeease, mom? Please? All right, look. You can watch from the porch but no closer th... Oh! You can't see nothin' from the porch! Sorry little fellah. In this world there is life and there is death and this- is your death. Give me a break. Really? What? Just keep digging. Dude. She's got a sick body, what do you want from me? She's out of your league, bro. Ahh! Why are we doing this shit now anyways, you know? It's November. The ground is still soft enough. Kellen knows that. Oh, really? - Stop it, Jimbo. - She knows Kellen already, huh? I saw the way he looked at you. I think our new friend here might have a little bit of a "daddy complex. Just like that Sienna chick. Shut up, dude, you're making an ass out of yourself. Oh, it's all right. Why do you have to be such a douchebag? Huh? She can take it. She's a tough little daddy's girl. Aren't you? One more word, motherfucker. Fuck this. I'm outta here. I'm sorry, I was just- Real smooth, Jimbo. Hate to watch her go, love to watch her leave. Hey. Hi. Some days are harder than others. Susan showed up from kindergarten. with a chrysanthemum in her hair. Declaring it was her new favorite flower. It's just so hard. But coming here, it just makes me feel like she's, she's safe. God, I am a mess. Why aren't in you in the field with the others? Let's go get a cup of tea at the house. Yeah? Okay. So, have you been enjoying your time on the farm so far? - Yeah, yeah it's been great. - Good, good. I mean, I kinda butt heads with one of the workers, but, I don't know, I guess that's just the way it goes. Mmm. Yeah. We'd be better off without some of the disrespectful kids my husband hires. They serve some purpose I suppose. You know, I really like Sadie. Well, Sadie gushes about you every time she talks about you. Do you have any brothers or sisters? No, I'm an only child. My dad died when I was little and, you know, it's just been me and my mom ever since. Oh, I'm so sorry. No, it's okay. He died in a car wreck. You know, what you said earlier, about Susan and her favorite flower. I have a memory like that about my dad. You know, it's so funny how one thing sticks out about somebody that you've lost. I just-I remember going to the playground and uh, there was this big slide. And I remember being on top and I was so nervous, so nervous to slide down. And then I-I saw his hands, and I felt so safe. Oh, sweetie. I got a pheasant! First one ever! Can you believe it? They're so hard to get! Okay, you can leave the bird outside. And you are going to pluck and feather it yourself, missy! Why wouldn't I? Lena! Hey. Aww. Hi. - Hi. - Hey. Don't I get a hug? Good job, sweetie, good, good job. Thanks for being so welcoming. Come by any time, the door's always open. See you later. See you. Hi. Hey. What's going on? Nothing. Just umm, spent some time with your cousin actually. Come on, I'm taking you fishing. All right. Lean back and let it fly, right? Right at twelve o'clock you let it go, you got this Lena. Hey! There you go. All right, flip the bail, reel, reel, reel. Come on. Basically you do that all day. Hope an Albie shows up, and when it does, it's game on, cap. You wanna get outta here? Go to Billy's? Absolutely. Gimme that. Let's go. Those guys are fucking it up for everybody.

Nope, just moved up-island. Look at you. - Hi honey. - Hey, well don't stay too long, 'cause you're gonna let a quarter century slip by and they'll be calling you a wash-a-shore. How you doin', Billy. I'm alright, man. We are still goin' out to George's Bank, right? - Yeah. - Right? Yeah. So uh, what are you, taking a little break from the wild hearts club?

I'll miss you too. I don't know I just feel like I've- found a family here. No, really. Like you and-and Sadie. Oh, she's a hot shit. She's a cool little farm kid. She's one of the good ones. I don't know, I'm kind of worried about her. Oh, I wouldn't. She can handle herself. You know, she stole your circus hat. What? I knew it! God know she is always taking shi... She denied it, but it's totally there. Alright, you know what? She can keep it. It's my gift to her. It's in that neighbor's basement. She calls it like her secret hiding pla... Ah, Yeah, Bart helped her set that up. - Yeah?! - Yeah. She's got this whole world she's created down there. - It's incredible. - Well, you must be special. I mean I never got an invite to go down there. - No? - No. So, why do you wanna go so bad? I don't, I could live anywhere, you know. And I love the water. But, uh, it's just, this place ain't right for Bartholomew. He's from here. Yeah, but you can spend too much time in a place. He's got so much history on this island. Once they label you around here, good luck shedding that tag. I don't know I-My island history is just beginning. Is this Emily's sweatshirt? Where the hell did you find this? Sadie gave it to me. Why does she have it? Creepy little bitch. What do you mean? It was in a big box of clothes. We were playing dress-up the other day. Emily never took this off. Sadie's a little clepto. She's actually a really good kid, Marge. There's gotta be a reason f... You just want to like them so much. And what's wrong with that? It was Emily's brothers' sweatshirt. She wore his dog tags, too- Come on, we gotta go. I don't wanna here Kellen bitching. Yeah. Where the hell is Jimbo? I don't know. He didn't come back last night. Fine by me. I gotta clear the back path by the south end, so- Yo-you and Zoe head down there, grab the trimmers and the hand tools, cut back the fence line and brush cut the paths, alright? We haven't been down there in a while. It's probably a- Got it. I need you to do some chores on the farm. Hay to the cows, feed the pigs. I hate feeding those stupid things- Cassie. Fine. How about you work in the field. Alright, just clear that big brush pile and dump it in the field by the pond at the end of the day. Alright, simple enough? Take a truck over to Phelps. You know where that is? You leave the farm, make a left. Yeah, I know. I've been there with Todd. Okay, take the clippers and loppers and just cut back all the shrubs for winter, alright? You alright? Yeah. I'm alright. Do you ever bend your knees when you lop? Wait, I do, don't I? - No. - Really? Wait, that's so weird. Wait, my god, you're so right. That's weird. Hey, so I was thinking, um- would you think about coming to Boston with me? Maybe. That sounds like a yes. Why don't you get back to work. That sounds like a yes ladies and gentlemen. That sounds like a yes! Hey, Zoe? Did I leave my hedgers over there? Zoe? Are you sleeping? Stupid pigs. Help me! You're not a pretty girl! You're not a pretty girl! You'r not a pretty girl! I can't trust anyone! You're an ugly girl! What the fuck. Okay guys, seriously. Stop fucking around. Sadie Is that you? Ugh, creepy little bitch. - Hello, Marg... - Jesus! Becca! Have you seen my "little bitch"?! Where did you get that? Sadie, why do you have Jimbo's hat? I told you to never go to my secret place without me! I trusted you. I thought you were my sister! Sadie, that's still true. Okay? But I have to know where you got those clothes. Why! Why did you break our pact! You're just like the rest of them! You're all liars, I hate you! I hate you! I thought you were different. What the hell is going on? She lied to me, daddy! Go do your chores. Daddy, she lied! Go. Let s go inside, Lena. Let's talk. Sit down. Don t be afraid. Where's Jimbo? I don't know. He didn't leave the island, did he? I want you to tell me how you feel about Sadie. - She's a special girl. - She likes you, very much. For her that's rare. I've never seen her warm to anyone. Like she has with you. I'm scared for her. Susan, our first daughter. When she was sixteen, she got a job. Down-island in the coffee shop. There was this summer dink. His name was Tucker. He took a liking to her. Boarding school kid, eighteen, came from money. Had that rich, cockiness about him. I didn't like him. But Susan did. Becca told me to give her space, so I did. Tucker took her down to the pond. Bartholomew was down there, way up at the head, fishing. He heard Susan scream. By the time he got down there, Tucker looked back at him, right before he disappeared into the woods- and when he got to Susan, she was already dead. Oh my God. People saw him around the island and he- acted like nothing had happened. I'm so sorry. So we followed him one night, down to the beach. Idiot, he walked right into us. So I held him down and Becca split his skull open with an ax. And I thought we were done. She liked it. A big team of fancy, city lawyers would have made Susan out to be a whore. That kid would have walked! And there's no way that was gonna happen. Becca. What did you do to the others? He didn't do anything! Sweetheart. I'm gonna go now. - Where the fuck!! Ahh! - Ahh! Ahhh! Nooooo! Becca!! Sienna! What? - Sienna! - What? What? - Everybody's dead. - What? Kellen was just telling me this story of Becca killed this guy- Okay, you gotta calm down cause you're talking crazy. She killed the guy that killed Susan! Susan was fuckin' murdered, Sienna. Jimbo has been gone for days, do you, - do you fuckin' trust me!? - Yes! Yes I fuckin' trust you! Then we have to get the fuck out of here now! I'm with you, but we gotta find Bart. I'm not going anywhere without him! Let's go. Over here, over here. Bart! Baby answer me! Bart! - Come on! Bart! Baby! Get up. - What? Baby we gotta go! We gotta get outta here! This it. It's Becca. Becca. Come on, we gotta get to the boat. Get in the boat! Get in the Boat. - Push it. - I got it. Come on. Come on, baby. Go! Go! No! Stop it! Stop it! Ahh! Ahh!! Ahh! Baby, I got you, baby. Baby. It's o-it's okay. Honey it's all right. It's Alright. It's okay sweetie. I got you sweetie, I got you. Daddy? - Come on. I got you, I got you! - Come on, come on, come on. Daddy, no!!! Go! Go! Go! Row, baby, row! - No baby, no! - Baby, it's okay. Sadie! Nooooo! No! No! No No! No! No! No! No! Sadie! No! No! Subtitles by explosiveskull
