Robbie, they're comin' around again. [GEESE HONKING] They're comin' in. Hey... [GROANS] Whoa! TV REPORTER: His appointment set off the most intense round of rioting in years. [GUNS FIRING] ...their sympathy to the protesters... [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] Look at this. You know what this is? It's the back end of a dying culture. Even in the city, everything you see, everything you touch, it's death. Well, I'm not dyin' with it. I mean, when it comes right down to it, which would you prefer? To kill or be killed? Mr. Daniels, are you happy? [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Is that a difficult question? I'm very happy. Oh, well... if you have all the money that you could possibly spend in a lifetime and you're very happy, then why do you have to keep making more? Money's the only way of keeping score. Okay, then what turns you on more than anything? Right this minute? Well... What's this interview really about, Angela? I don't know what you mean. Yeah, I know what you do. You relax the person... you ask a few meaningless questions... and then you...squeeze... [BOTH CHUCKLE SOFTLY] I have to turn the, uh...the tape over. [ALARM BEEPING] Excuse me. What is it? Uh, it's, uh, just a prowler. Nothin' to be worried about. Ah, ah, ah. I just wanna see. No, you see nothin', baby. [CLATTERING] I was just lookin' for a place to sleep. I'm goin'. Now easy, easy with that thing, huh? I'm goin'. You sure are. [GUNSHOT] [SIREN WAILING IN THE DISTANCE] -Lieutenant? -Umm? There's a woman in the house you might wanna talk to. Bag him. How many times did you fire your gun? Twice. Twice. Uh, and what was he, what, about 20 feet away? Closer. Maybe 10. Ten feet away, okay. And he was, what, swingin' the machete, swingin' it back and forth? Slashing at me, yeah. Slashing at you, okay, but he didn't get a swipe at you, did he? Fortunately, no. Okay, okay. Can I go now, Detective? Sure you can go. You didn't see anything. I'll see you in court. Tuesday, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. It'll be my pleasure, Ms. Nolan. After this, maybe we should get together again. Pick up where we left off. Ah, yeah, thanks. Couldn't you have at least fired a warning shot? No time. What about that woman on the balcony? I mean, she must've seen something. Why didn't you tell Kouza? [CHUCKLES] Poor, dumb Dorrie...probably just confuse the police. I'm sure she didn't see anything, just like you. Yeah. Yeah. Come on, I'll walk you. -You're lucky you got Kouza. -Why is that? He's got blind spots worse than a semi. Nice place. You live in the area? Hamtramck. Only claim to fame is John Wojtylo. He's the Pope's cousin. Ah, is that right? How long you been with the Detroit Police? Oh, about 19 years. Have you got an ashtray? No. You ever shoot anybody? Uh, eight, um...eight colored, one Caucasian. Never shot a woman. How many you kill? I shot nine, I killed nine. One guy, he didn't die for a year. His mother and his brother are suing me. Ten million bucks. Can you believe that? Ten million bucks for some nothin' loser's life? I gotta go to court next week. That's what the dame was mouthin' off about. You know, see ya in court. What was she doing here, anyways? Interviewing me for an article about the rich. Oh, yeah? I don't think she likes us much. Yeah, she usually writes crap about the police. You know, excessive violence. You know, sometimes you got no choice but to take a guy out. So, what do you carry? Browning 9mm. -May I? -Hey, what are you doin'? -Hey, hey, hey! -It's okay... [CLICKS SAFETY CATCH OFF] Robbie, I'm... Take care, Dorrie. [HEELS CLICKING RAPIDLY AWAY] Let me show ya something. Hey! Magnum 4, hey... Dirty Harry,huh? Dirty Harry,yeah! [CHUCKLES] -There's more. -Oh, yeah? Oh, now, hey, that is nice. That is nice. I got some other pieces here that, uh, might surprise you. Yeah? Thing is, I'm not supposed to have them. Oh, well, hey, I happen to be off duty now. What are you doin', Rob, goin' to war? [BOTH LAUGHING] What happened to your girlfriend, darling? She left awfully fast. Good night, Patti. It was. My wife. Business is a game. It's a violent game. You play according to the rules of the jungle. It's not as violent as the real world... but it has the same instincts at its heart. [TAPE RECORDER REWINDING] You play according to the rules of the jungle. It's not as violent as the real world... but it has the same instincts at its heart. [WOMAN SIGHING] [WOMAN GASPING] [GUN FIRING] On that day, the day that Walter Kouza shot Darius Roy... subsequently ending his life... Objection, Your Honor. Sustained. Strike "subsequently ending his life." He's dead, right? -JUDGE: Order. -He's dead, right? Curtis... On that day, why did you go to the Roy apartment? We had a tip. We got the address on a tip. But we got a bad tip. It was the wrong address. And how did you enter the Roy apartment? -They kicked the door in. -JUDGE: Mr. Randall... RANDALL: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Restrain your client. Curtis, please. So, Lieutenant Hurd, all seven officers entered the apartment? That's right. Think you had enough troops for the job? [SPECTATORS LAUGHING] -JUDGE: Order! -[GAVEL BANGING] And when you got inside the Roy apartment, what were they doing? They were eating. They had pie on the table, they had soda, big plastic bottles. And what did Mr. Kouza say to Darius Roy? Well, Mr. Roy was heading towards the kitchen and... Mr. Kouza just simply said, "Stop, don't move." And then what happened? Well, Roy headed back towards where Kouza was standing... and at that point Mr. Kouza decided that he would open fire. I though Darius Roy was shot in the spine. That's right. It went through the front. -It must've been a powerful weapon. -It was a magnum. -[GAVEL BANGING] -JUDGE: Mr. Roy! It was a big... No, Ma. It was a big... Fool, what are you askin' him for? Ma! -JUDGE: Order! -Curtis! -Ask me what that fat bas... -[GAVEL BANGING FURIOUSLY] Hey, shut the hell up! -Objection, Your Honor! -JUDGE: Mr. Kouza! He wanted to shoot everybody! That's what he really wanted to do, but this one stopped him. JUDGE: Mr. Randall! Mr. Roy! Mr. Randall! I have seen enough of Mr. Roy in this court! Now he can leave on his own, or the officers can remove him. Oh, I gotta go now? Now that's it, you're out of my court! No, let me go, let me go. That's all right. Don't touch me. Don't touch me! Yo, you got yours comin', 'cause you got yours comin', man! -Shut up! -Mr. Kouza! -Shut your mouth, ya black... -Mr. Kouza... Ya money grabbin' little punk! Mr. Randall. -You see? -Order! Order! Don't touch me. Counselor, I will charge your client with contempt. We're sorry, Your Honor. Have you finished with this witness, Mr. Randall? I have one final area to cover, Your Honor. Well, then, continue. Was Darius, at the time he was shot, was he holding anything in his hand? Yeah, he was. He was holding a knife. What kind? A big butcher knife? No, it was a silverware knife. Just a plain, ordinary silverware knife? That's right, that's right. With banana cream pie on it, okay? [LAUGHTER] No further questions, Your Honor. You may step down now, Lieutenant Hurd. There's no smoking. Hello, Robbie. What are you doing here? Watching. Me? No, baby. Kouza? Hey, creep! -What? -Now they're gonna knock me down to Sergeant! -Is that right? -Yeah, that's right. -Is that my problem? -That's right, it is your problem! Just you wait till you need back up. You fink! Take it easy, Walter. -I'll look after everything. -Oh, yeah, right. Get outta here! Walter? Excuse me. What are you doin' here? I came to see you. Oh, yeah? For what? Moral support. [CHUCKLING] Yeah. Hi, Bryan. What are you doin' down here? I thought you gave up this beat. Thought you moved on to bigger and better things, no? I guess not. I thought you moved away, you might've left town or somethin'. No, I've just been busy. So I guess your testimony could really do Kouza in, huh? Maybe. Listen, you wanna go for a drink? Drink? Yeah, a drink, Angela. Can you just relax for once? Yeah, okay. -How do you know Daniels? -I'm doing an article on him. Is he interesting? If you mean am I interested, the answer is no. [ADMIRINGLY] Is he slick! Oh, are you saying you're interested? You're still all business. Don't. God, I'm never gonna get off now. Take it easy, Walter. You... You can still discredit this homicide guy, Bryan Hurd. Just make it look like he's got a personal grudge or something. It's that kid, Curtis, you should be worried about. Yeah, he's a real punk. He's dyin' to make a buck outta this. With so many blacks on the jury, he's definitely gonna be a problem. You know, Mr. Daniels... if there's anything that you can do... to help me out, you know, I'd really appreciate to hear it. Tell me, Walter... when you shot those...those nine people... how'd you feel? How'd I feel? Yeah. You felt...bad... sick...happy? Um, I guess, guess I never really thought about it... but I suppose felt like... I was glad it was them and not me. How much you like bein' a cop, Walter? Okay... Except when crap like this happens. Say I was to offer you...two grand a week to give it up. Two grand a week? What would have to do for that? Drive. Act as my bodyguard. You could call it security work. Would have to wear a chauffeur's uniform or a peaked hat or something? [LAUGHS] Two grand a week? What do I do first, Rob? [LAUGHS] First, you call me Mr. Daniels. That's no problem. Okay, Mr. Daniels. How's that [CHUCKLING] Mr. Daniels? The other thing, you're gonna have to quit smoking. [WHEEZY LAUGH, BECOMES COUGHING] [WHEEZING] That's no problem, no problem. I turn 30 next week. Oh, I'm sorry. -Great. -[BOTH LAUGH] Why don't you come back to my apartment? Well, you haven't changed much, have you? Just as romantic as ever. What are we doing? I don't know. Maybe you could give me a lift home. I came in a squad car. -Yeah. -All right? Yep, fine. If this lady's interviewing you, Lieutenant, let me give you a word of warning. Three words, to be exact. Watch your ass. -Robbie Daniels. -How do you do? I believe you already know my new driver and head of security, Walter Kouza. Planning for the future there, Walter? Oh, that's funny. That's very funny. Who's threatening your security, Robbie? Oh, you know, the usual crackpots who hate the rich. So, Angela, when are we gonna finish what we started? Well, I'll call you. Remember my warning. -Oh, no, I'll get that. -No, I got it, I got it. Okay. You all right? Yeah. Still drink beer? Here you are. Whose are these? It's a friend. Whoo! [CHUCKLES] You didn't think I'd still be pining after a year and a half, did ya? No, didn't. [SCOFFS] Uh-oh, I think this is a mistake. Hey... Come on. Sit down. Uh... No, I think... I think I'm gonna go. Oh, forgot something in the trunk. I just parked it. Well, look, if it's all the same to you, I'll just... I'll go down and get it myself, okay? Just make sure nobody sees, all right? It's against the rules. You got it. [TIRES SCREECHING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Hey, yo, man, what are you still doin' here? You're gonna get me fired. That's not gonna happen, Curtis. How'd you know my name? I know a lot of things. [CHUCKLES] What do you want? What's... What's the problem, man? Gonna make you a star, pal. No, please, no. Don't, no! [GUNSHOT] [GLASS SHATTERING] Let's bring the other attendant downtown... and pull the tickets on all the cars parked down here in the last two hours. Run their plates, all right, Bridget? I'll find out who checked in and out of the hotel around 10 and see if they saw... anybody comin' out of the garage that wasn't in a uniform. Okay, and see if anybody saw a Lincoln Continental parked down here. And I think we should send Quentin over to pick up Walter Kouza. -[SCOFFS] Walter? -Yes. Oh, come on, he can't be that stupid. Walter's never used a .22 in his life. Maybe not, but let's ruin his day, anyway. Hey, Bryan. -Okay, come on. -What happened? -Well, we don't know yet. -Did Walter do it? We don't know, Angela! I'll start runnin' those tags. Forget about it, Bridget. I already did. What's this? Oh, yeah. Okay, thanks. Look, I'm sorry about last night. So are you picking Walter up? I can't discuss the case, Angela. You know, if you asked me over again, I might not say no. Really? Why should I ask? Because you...want to? Were those Bridget's underwear? -No, they were mine. -[LAUGHS] That's very funny. So what are you doing tonight? -Hello, Walter. -What the hell are you doin'? What the hell are you doin' callin' me in here like this? We gotta ask you some questions, Walter. About what? Somebody did Curtis Roy. Come on. You didn't hear about it? It's been all over the news! No, how am gonna hear about it? I've been drivin' around for Daniels all day. But, uh... I'll tell ya somethin'. You find out who did it, you let me know. I wanna shake his hand. Step inside. We gotta take a full statement. Oh, dear, did Robbie shoot somebody again? Hey, Mrs. Daniels. My name is Walter Kouza. I'm your husband's new head of security. Well, that sounds impressive. Can I ask you something, Walter... Kouza? Sure, Mrs. Daniels. What do they call it? Call? Call what? Walter. Oh, hi, Mr. Daniels. How ya doin'? You been smokin' in here? No, no. Your wife... Mr. Daniels, I gotta talk to ya. I gotta ask ya something. Let's have a drink. Mr. Daniels... [CLEARS THROAT] Was it you that did Curtis Roy? You mean that kid who was gonna testify against you in court? No, thank you. And who was shot and killed in the parking garage? With a High Standard Field King .22? Nah, must've been somebody else. I knew it, but I didn't believe it. Good. Nobody else will, either. No, please, no. Don't, no! Uh... [CHUCKLES] Mr. Daniels, I've been a cop for... over 20 years, and there is no way... that you can commit a homicide at a place like that... with people around and get away with it. Aren't you relieved that he's dead? Yeah, of course I'm relieved that he's dead. Your legal problems are over. They're gonna have to drop the suit. Mr. Daniels, I appreciate what you did, but... [SIGHS] you're in the worst trouble of your life. -Did they question you? -Yes. Did they mention my name as a suspect? No, but it could get around to you. Walter, with a kid like Curtis Roy, they just go though the motions. Cops don't care when scum like that gets blown away. So did you do it for me? On account of the lawsuit? Well, not entirely. Yeah, I mean, I figured, you know, there must be some other reason... to take a risk like that. You mind telling me why you did it? Practice. I liked watching you at the scene today. You really took charge. Yeah, right. Seriously. -Ready for this? -I'm ready. ♪♪ Now I know it's right, from the moment I wake up ♪♪ So you know what happens now? [LAUGHING] I think have a pretty good idea! What? Well... [CHUCKLES] This. -And this. -And this. Bryan, aren't we a little old to still be making out to Foreigner? No? Thanks. You were right. Robbie Daniels confirmed Walter's alibi. What? This file on the prowler killing at the Daniels estate's not complete. -Oh, sure it is! -I'm telling you, it's not complete. I pulled it myself. There's no fingerprint report in there, on the machete. What are you thinking? Kouza. It's standard procedure. Why wouldn't he do it? He's sloppy. Or maybe he's not too sure the perp ever touched that weapon. So Walter made it easy on Robbie? Maybe. And now Robbie's returning the favor. He's covering for Walter. Who's gonna question the word of a Robinson Daniels, right? Oh, so I should stay on Walter. That's right. Angela asked about you. -Yeah? -Yeah. What are you gonna do about it? I wanna speak to all the officers who were on the estate that night, okay? [DORRIE MOANING SEDUCTIVELY] Walter, you still here? Oh, yeah. I was... I just want to, I just want to see this one more time. Perfect, perfect Dorrie. You sure she left town? -Yeah, she left town. Too bad, huh? -Get outta here, Walter. -Hey, come on, come on! -Get outta here fast, I have a visitor. [DORRIE GASPS] [MOANS] ♪♪ Maybe I'm wrong ♪♪ Won't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong ♪♪ This heart of mine has been hurt before ♪♪ This time I wanna be sure ♪♪ I've been waiting for a girl like you ♪♪ ANGELA: Couldn't you have at least have fired a warning shot? ROBBIE: No time. ANGELA: And what about that woman on the balcony? I mean, she must have seen something. Why didn't you tell Kouza about it? ROBBIE: Poor, dumb Dorrie. Probably just confuse the police. I'm sure she didn't see anything, just like you. ANGELA: You're lucky you got Kouza. ROBBIE: Why is that? He's got blind spots worse than a subway. Yeah. -Can I tell you something, Mr. Daniels? -Sure. A few years ago, I was working in sex crimes... and there was this rapist going around. Raped about 30 women. So they put me on decoy. One night, this guy follows me down a dark street... shoves me into a doorway. Now he takes out a 12-inch blade and you know what he said to me? He said, "I'm gonna tie you up now, sweetheart, tear you apart." What'd you do? I shot him. -Dead? -He wasn't that lucky. He's doing 12 to 25 with a limp. [GIGGLES] So, Mr. Daniels... were you at the Plaza last Saturday morning? Ah, let me see. No, I dropped a couple guys off at the Ponch...on, uh, Saturday morning. I was, uh, at the Plaza picking somebody up, but that was later in the day. I was driving a black Mercedes, in case you wanna know. Hmm. Hey, you ever been a model? -No. -Huh. Ever been on TV? A couple times...walkin' prisoners into the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice. You like your toys, don't you, Mr. Daniels? Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Really? Yeah, go ahead, I got it, I got it. Oh, that's very good. Let's hope so, huh? Okay. Morning. That was Bridget. She's, uh, she's found a guy from Detroit... who checked outta the hotel that same morning that kid got killed... so maybe we can place Robbie on the scene. I shouldn't be too long. Hold on. What do I do? Wait. -No way! -You can't sit in on it. You know that. Bryan, we've got an agreement. My research for your information. All right, you can give me a lift and then we'll talk about it afterwards. -I'm not your driver. -Then we'll see ya later, all right? All right, give me five minutes. An actual five minutes? Five minutes, Bryan. And no one else was with Daniels in the car? No, no, he was alone. Okay. Thanks very much for coming down, Mr. Maynard. We'll call you if we need anything else. -Yeah, thanks a lot. -Thank you. -Good bye. -Bye, bye. -Nice work, Bridget. -Thanks. -What? -Your lunch date's waiting. Well, we got one guy who can put Robbie in the garage. -Pick him up then. -We need two. But why does a guy like Robbie Daniels... wanna do something like this for a chump like Walter? Man, is this a story! ANGELA: [SURPRISED] Robbie. -How'd you get in here? -Hurd, you play golf? -No. -Oh, I'll teach you later this afternoon. -Why? -You seem to wanna get to know me. Why get it second hand from Bridget? I hear you made her a star. Yes, she's very photogenic. I'll have Walter pick you up around four. I'll see ya. When are we going to continue the interviews? I'll call you. She'll call you. So how is that? Pretty nice stuff? You'd better watch yourself, otherwise you won't get a chance... to know me too good this afternoon, because your jaw's gonna be wired shut. Ooh! What? The guy just walks right in here! HURD: So, how's the new job? You like working for this guy, Walter? I remember I drove someone one time. I got to go to a lot of parties. Get to any parties? Walter? I bet you see some really interesting stuff, huh? Hey, Walter, how come they don't give you... the chauffeur's uniform, the little peaked cap? -Hey, listen, wise guy. -You talking to me, driver? Yeah, you, you think you're so clever, right? -I do? -I say you're bush! Homicide lieutenant and all that. You're still bush! Yeah, someday you'll see how it's done in the majors, wise guy. I'll say this for ya, Walter. You're a very good driver. You'll always find work. [TIRES SCREECH] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Paul Calderone, the great international banker. How are you, Paul? Still sleeping with little girls, Robbie? Oh, is your sister back in town, Cheech? I wish I'd known you were coming out today. I ended up playing with somebody who almost beat me. Don't you miss your people, Paul, living this far north? No, I get lonely, I sleep with your wife. Oh, you too? When I'm not with Dorrie Vaughan. Too bad you let a nice piece like that slip away, Robbie. Yeah, well... We ran outta things to talk about. That's not what she says. Lieutenant! Paul Calderone, Lieutenant Bryan Hurd. -How do you do? -How are you? Senor Cheech here is even richer than I am, and he doesn't even deal drugs. First thing we do is get you some clothes. I've got clothes. You look like the Easter Bunny. [ROBBIE LAUGHS] Oh, too bad. You ought to keep your head down. Thanks, Larry. See you Tuesday. Thank you, Mr. Calderone. Have a good day. It feels pretty hot. You ever kill anyone? No. But I was reading about a guy that you killed. Yes, that prowler. Terrible thing. No, I was thinking about a guy in a marsh. Ah, Gossage. Shocking. Pushed it right out of my mind. That prowler came at me with a machete. It was pretty scary. -So what'd you use? -Colt Python. My favorite. What do you carry? I got a Beretta 85. Nice piece. Very light. That's true. You never killed anyone? No. I never had to. But you shot someone? No. I never even had to pull my weapon that many times. I feel that nine out of 10 shootings can be avoided. Yeah, maybe... But then there are some people who are just begging to be killed. You think so? I don't agree. I think even the biggest scumbag in the world wants to live. In my experience... Let's just say I've seen people that are in such bad shape... they got sores all over their bodies... they got track marks up and down their arms so bad their veins are falling... and they're just as afraid as the next guy about dying. That's what I noticed. That doesn't mean they don't deserve to die. Sounds to me like you think that killing someone's really no big deal at all. I didn't say that. You didn't? I just have a different perspective. I mean... you've never shot anyone and I've shot two people, then who's the expert here? [CHUCKLES] [COUGHING] KOUZA: Oh, yeah, okay. Hey, baby, yes. Take off the top. Yes, baby. Oh, there's the big guy. Hello, darling. -WOMAN: Hi. -KOUZA: Jeez! [KNOCKING ON DOOR] -Hi. -Yeah. [SIGHS] How'd it go? I lost. Not the game. Oh, he confessed to everything. Bryan. He didn't say anything. He did say something about how certain people deserve to die or something. Well, didn't he show any emotion when he talked about it? Not really. He didn't get excited? I didn't notice. Bryan, aren't you gonna do something before somebody else gets killed? Well, what do you think I should do? Should I arrest him? Maybe. For what? On suspicion of getting off on killing people? I'm a homicide cop. That's not what I do. I don't know about preventing murders. I just go in afterwards and I clean 'em up. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah? Hello, Robbie. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, I think I can arrange that. How about next week? Hold on. Okay, day after tomorrow then. Right. Bye. What's he want? He wants to finish the interview. Well, I think you should hold off on that for a while. I thought you weren't worried. Just give it a week or two. Uh-uh, he's leaving for Florida in two days. I won't get another chance. There's a lot of other rich people out there, Angela, you could talk to. Just leave Daniels alone for now. Bryan, I can handle Robbie. Look, if I find out that you've gone to see him, I'm gonna have you arrested for interfering with this investigation. -Do you understand me? -You'll arrest me? That's right. For your own protection! You can leave, Bryan. Look, if this guy is what you think he is, this is not someone that you can handle. Just leave. I'm not kidding around here, Angela. Goodbye, Bryan. Okay, forget it. My God, you're still here. -Got an address on Dorrie Vaughn. -Good girl. That sleaze agent of hers says she's been living with Paul Calderone. -Calderone? -Yeah. -You're kidding? -No, why? You know him? Oh, he and Robbie belong to the same club. I got the feeling there's no love lost between these two guys. Maybe this is why. No, no. Robbie's not the possessive type when it comes to women. But I bet he's pissed she's still in town. -Why don't you talk to her tomorrow? -Why me? She might talk more easily to you. What if she didn't see anything? Well, my bet is that she did. That's why Robbie baby kicked her loose. Okay. Where are you going? Home. -Oh. -Alone. ROBBIE: So she never left. That little liar. I don't believe it. He comes home. He sees the broad with her tush stickin' up like that, and he don't touch her. He's gotta be a fruit. We don't need any more surveillance, Walter. I want to do Calderone. What? Why? He's beggin' to be killed. What do you mean? What, 'cause of Dorrie, you mean? He cheats at golf. What? That's crazy! Are you tryin' to tell me my business? No, no, no. I'm... I just... You don't kill a guy 'cause you don't like him. Why not? Haven't you ever done that? All nine of those guys that you shot, you shot 'cause your life was in danger? No, no, not exactly. It's just that, I... That's exactly how I feel about Calderone. He makes the rich look cheap. I mean, look at this house. So when were you thinkin' about doin' this? Tomorrow. -Tomorrow? You got a golf date with the guy tomorrow! -Right after golf. After golf? What about the broad? -The broad. I don't do broads! I told you that. -Don't worry about Dorrie. -I'm not gonna start doin' broads now. -I'll take care of Dorrie! What are you thinkin' about? What to wear. Yeah, is this Dorrie Vaughan's agent? Yeah, this is United Tire over on Michigan. Yeah, we're shooting a commercial here today and, uh... our actress got sick. Ha, well, ya know, it happens. Yeah, uh, Miss Vaughn gave me her card a couple of months ago. Yeah. Is she available? Super. This afternoon around five? Super! You're six strokes up, Cheech. I know. What do you say we raise the stakes to a grand a hole? You think I'm rich? Filthy rich. A thousand a hole then. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Oh, hi, Lionel. Yeah. Great, a commercial! Oh, that's fantastic! Yeah, hold on one second. Okay, United Tire on Michigan. Okay, five o'clock. Got it. Thanks. That's great, yeah. Okay, bye. Darcie, I'm gonna be a star. See you, Robbie. No shower? No, I gotta get going. Oh, you can give me the six thousand in a check. I trust you. It's in the mail. Ciao,Cheech. ROBBIE: Okay, down low, down low, get down low. He's gonna be comin' up through the water. ROBBIE: That's it. Okay, lean. Perfect. That's it. That's perfect. It's show time. Robbie, what are you doing here? And this man and this camera. You're making a film? Yeah, we're makin' a film. Ah, it's wonderful. -And I'm in it, huh? -Oh, you're the star! But, uh, where's Dorrie? Oh, she's shooting a commercial. Too bad you missed her. Yeah, tell me about it. She was gonna be your co-star. So, Robbie, what's this movie all about? Death. Oh, that's a very serious subject. Whose death? Yours. [LAUGHS] Wouldn't you like to have a drink first? Maybe later. Come on, Robbie, huh? It's a joke, huh? You gettin' all this, Walter? Come on, enough's enough. This is a joke, huh? Whoo! Whoa, keep rollin', Walter. Keep rollin'. It's beautiful. Hello? Double feature, Walter, double feature! Miss Vaughn? Oh, God! Oh! Officer Riley! -Come on, Walter, turn the camera on. -No. -Turn it on! -No. I don't do broads, I told you that! I'm only gonna chase her. Let's scare her. Come on, turn the thing on! Go, go, go! Come on, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up! She's way ahead of us. Go, go, move! Go faster. Put the camera on and point it at her. Come on. This is crazy. I'm gettin' bitten. -I'm gonna fall! -Stay with her, stay with her. I got her, I got her. -You gettin' her? -Yeah, yeah. -Are you sure? -Yeah, yeah. This is crazy! We're just chasin' her, right? [PANTING] Stay with her. Don't lose her, don't lose her. I ran outta tape. All right, change it. Hurry up. Hurry up. You got it? No. Please don't! Don't! Please don't! [AUTOMATIC WEAPON FIRING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] You're sick, man! You're sick! You kill a woman like that? You're crazy! [ROBBIE'S DEMENTED LAUGH] [KOUZA PANTING] No! Please don't! Don't! Please don't! -[AUTOMATIC WEAPON FIRING] -[BRIDGET SCREAMING] We've got one chance to get this guy. If we screw up, we lose him. He's gotten away with this before. Not this time. We just kill him. Bryan, we gotta get to Dorrie Vaughan before Robbie does. Maybe Walter will talk now. He can't go along with killing a cop. Okay. Okay? [EXHALES] I'll find him. Oh, you found me, huh? [LAUGHS] Well, I'm a cop. It's my job. It used to be your job, too. You know, I heard about what happened to Bridget. It makes me sick. What was that guy, Calderone? Was he a dealer or something? What? You got a choice. You either give me Robbie Daniels, or I take you down, too. I don't know what you're talkin' about. You testify, and I want the machine gun that he used on Bridget. -What are we talkin' about here, immunity? -Not a chance. -You got 24 hours. [FIST SMASHING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] What the hell you lookin' at? Get me a double Wild Turkey. [BELCHES] ROBBIE: Hello? Yeah. I'm leavin' the country, and you're gonna finance it. Walter, don't panic. Talk to me. Well, I can either sell ya the tape, or I can give it to the cops. Where can I meet you to talk? The Hamtramck Bar, and you be there by eight o'clock... and you don't try anything! -Walter... -'Cause there's a lot of cops around! Walter. Walter... [DIAL TONE] [BREATHES HEAVILY] -You okay, Walter? -Yeah, yeah. [GIGGLES] I love this thing! [GIGGLES] I love it. [BRAKES SQUEALING] [METAL CLANKING] [PHONE RINGING] Angela. Hello. Robbie? We have to do the interview tonight. Tonight? It's Walter. He's out of control. I found something that connects him to the Curtis Roy murder... and now he's threatening me. I'm leaving for Florida in the morning. Uh... What did you find? No, we have to talk in person. You're going to have to meet me. My place, two hours. All right, I'll see you then. Bye. You tell Bryan Hurd I wanna talk to him! That's right! You tell him Walter Kouza wants to talk to him immediately! Yes! Well, you find out where the hell he is and you have him call me! No, I'm at my sister's! That's correct. That is correct... [SLAMS DOWN RECEIVER] [KNOCKING ON WINDOW] How did you find me? I was late. I saw you take off. I tried calling your name, but you really seemed hell bent to get outta there. Don't be so paranoid, Kouza. We're birds of a feather, remember? Uh-huh, I remember. That's why I'm searching you. Sit down. What's the deal, Walter? The deal is... [CLEARS THROAT] our deal...two hundred... Two hundred-fifty... thousand. Cash. Untraceable bills. For the tape. You mean, for the tapes, don't you, Walter? No. There's only one. I threw the other one away. Now that wasn't very smart, was it? [LAUGHING] So you gonna pay, or what? Which tape do you have? Calderone. Why would I give you a quarter-million for it, Walter? 'Cause you're in it, Rob. And if I don't pay? Bryan Hurd gets a very interesting package in the mail. And he doesn't ask who the cameraman is? [LAUGHS] I'll give you a hundred grand... But you gotta prove to me that you have the tape. A hundred? Take it or leave it. Okay. Okay, you wait here. [CHUCKLING] [SILENCED GUNSHOTS] -[SLOWED DOWN] Why, thanks... -[SILENCED GUNSHOT] HURD: Again. Lieutenant, we been doin' this for hours. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What's that? What's this? Looks like a brogue. Does Walter wear brogues? I don't know. Well, it's too late for that. [PHONE RINGING] Lieutenant, call for you. Yeah, Lieutenant Hurd. Bryan, guess who just showed up lookin' for protection? Who? Dorrie Vaughn. -[SOBBING] -You've got nothin' to be scared of. No, you don't understand! When he finds out that I'm here, he'll kill me! Well, he's not gonna find out. Just relax, all right? Just take it easy for a minute and relax. I don't know. What do you think? She'd testify against her own mother, she's so scared. Then we've got him. Get me a search warrant on the estate. Get me an arrest warrant and I'll meet ya over there. Whoa, wait. That could take two hours. -Homicide. -I don't care. I'm prepared to wait. I wanna be the guy that cuffs him. -Lieutenant Hurd, phone. -Not now. -All right, don't go in before we get the warrant. -Right. -We don't wanna lose him. -Right! Sorry, he just left. Any message? Uh, yeah, uh, tell him that, um... uh, just tell him that Angela called, please. Okay. Thanks. Goodnight. [HUFFS SEVERAL TIMES] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Oh, Angela! Right on time, Angie. Please, come in. [SURVEILLANCE CAMERA WHIRRING] Okay, so, what do you have on Walter? He's really disappointed me. What have you got? Scotch? Robbie, don't play games with me. You don't like games? You said you had incriminating evidence. Ice? Okay, show it to me or I leave. What's your hurry? We have all night. I have a videotape I want you to see. I review my surveillance tapes occasionally. When I saw this footage, I checked my collection. So you think Walter stole the gun and killed Curtis? I can't believe I trusted him. [ELECTRONIC ALARM BEEPING] Looks like I shouldn't have trusted you, either. I had no idea he was coming! What'd you think was going to happen, huh? Did you think I was gonna confess while he stood behind the door? -No! -Sit down, Angela. [CHUCKLES] You think your Bryan's in the mood for a little hide and seek? ANGELA: Mr. Daniels... [ROBBIE AND ANGELA CHUCKLE] ANGELA: Is that a difficult question? ROBBIE: I'm very happy. ANGELA: Well, if you have all the money that you could possibly spend in a lifetime and you're very happy, then why do you have to keep making more? ROBBIE: Money's the only way of keeping score. ROBBIE: You know what I'd like to do to you right now? A man's got to defend himself, Angela. Remember? It's either kill or be killed. [WOMAN MOANING ON TV] ROBBIE [ ON TV]: Hi, Bryan. ROBBIE [ ON TV]: Say goodbye, Angela. [AUTOMATIC WEAPON FIRING] Where are ya? ROBBIE: What's the matter, Bryan? Not having a good time? Come on out, you little puke. Oh, I guess not. He must've found Walter's body. Walter? It was him or me. So what are you gonna do then, kill another cop? If I have to. Listen, Robbie. People might believe that you killed Kouza in self-defense... but not Bryan. Let's talk to him, okay? Maybe he can help ya out. I don't think so, Angela. I really don't think so. But it was a good try. A very good try. [GRUNTS] [AUTOMATIC WEAPON FIRING] Bryan! Bryan! [AUTOMATIC WEAPON FIRING] [GROANS] [GROANS] How's it feel, Bryan? [LAUGHS] It's your first time. I'm gonna have to kill you for that. -I thought you were dead. -He wants you. Hey, Angela, you know what I'm gonna do to ya? After I...kill Bryan? Huh? First, I'm gonna tie ya up... [ROBBIE GIGGLING CRAZILY] ROBBIE: Missed me! [CACKLES MANIACALLY] ANGELA: How's your arm? Are you okay? Bryan, are you okay? [BRYAN GROANS] Bryan, are you all right? ANGELA: Bryan! [ANGELA SOBBING] [SOBBING] No! Bryan. Bryan, no. Holy God.[SOBBING] You...bastard! Oh, God. Hi, baby. Come see your movie. [ANGELA SOBBING IN VIDEO] Too bad we had such lousy lighting. Maybe we can do somethin' with the color correction, huh? [ANGELA SOBBING IN VIDEO] [CHUCKING] You're great, don't you think? Huh? All right, it gets good now. Watch this. Okay, watch. Yeah! Oh, that's cool! Oh, yeah. Okay, now... Let's shoot your close-up. Yeah, what are you gonna do, huh? -Yeah, I heard talk... -Action. Get off of me. -Come on, give me some tears. -Get off of me! Give me some tears. Come on, come on! Cry for me, baby, cry. Cry for me! I will not cry for you! Come on, gimme a little terror, come on! -Get off of me. -Give it to me. -Get off! Pig! -Quick, come on, come on! [GUNSHOT] So what is this? Is this live? Or is this Betamax? Angela, come here. [ANGELA SOBBING] [SIREN WAILING IN THE DISTANCE] OFFICER 1: Whoa, these guys make a good team. I don't remember them givin' lessons on playin' dead at the Academy. OFFICER 2: Maybe they should. Daniels sure fell for it. OFFICER 1: Yeah. I just need one minute. [APPLAUSE] All right, give the man a golden statue. Hurd, this thing goes live at five, baby, you could be a star! Great. How ya doin'? Feelin' okay? Oh, no. I just heard... I'm sorry about Bridget. They're... They're gonna take me to the hospital and all. Should I meet you there? Maybe you can stay with me for a few days. You know, at least until your arm gets a bit better. I'm not a good patient. I'm not a good nurse. ROBBIE: Give me some tears, Angela. Come on. Get off me. -Cry. Cry for me. Cry for me. -Get off of me. -Do it. -I'm not gonna cry for you! -I'm not afraid of you! Get off! -[GUNSHOT] Maybe I'll pick up a couple of videos on the way home. -Maybe not. -[ANGELA LAUGHS] HURD: So what is this? Is this live? Or is this Betamax? [GUNS FIRING]
