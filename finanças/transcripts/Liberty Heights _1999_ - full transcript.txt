I grew up in the northwest section of Baltimore. It was all Jewish. In fact, I didn't even think of it in those terms. I just assumed everyone was Jewish. Abrams. The whole world was Jewish. Ackerman. I remember when I was in the second grade... the first clue that some people were different occurred to me then. Cohen. Cohen. Der. I even thought Ping Der was Jewish. The "Ping" part didn't sound Jewish, but I assumed it was a nickname. Her brother's name was Minhuey, and that definitely sounded Jewish. I sensed there was a world beyond what I knew... when I had lunch at Butch Johnson's house. Something wrong, Ben? No. This is fine. I just never had raw bread before. We always cook it. You know, toast it. I can do that. There's too much white here. The milk's white, the bread's white. It's all white stuff. What do you normally have? Not this. What was on the bread? Luncheon meat. I've never heard of it. Not bologna? Not salami? No, luncheon meat with mayonnaise and milk. Everything was white. Well, they must not be Jewish. They're the other kind. A couple of years later, I began to realize... that the other kind was about 99% of the world. I went to school thinking everyone was Jewish. Now I know almost no one is Jewish. The other kind. I was reminded of that revelation the summer Murray, Sheldon and myself... went to the Turkey Hills Swim Club. She's gotta be the most beautiful girl on earth. Look at those cigarettes. So sexy. So sexy. She's gotta be wild. If she's doing that with a pack of cigarettes... she's gotta be wild. - How'd they come up with that order? - What? That Jews should be first. Yeah, I would've thought it'd be dogs, coloreds, then Jews. Must've been some meeting to come up with that. Some guy had to say: "I have to say, Jews bother me more than the dogs." So now a dog goes there. Does he read the sign and leave? I would've put dogs first. A dog can take a piss. You're walking barefoot. A Jew's not gonna lift his leg and pee on the wall. You know, I've never seen a colored person swim or sunbathe, period. Did you? Now that you mention it, I don't think I have. I'm thinking Atlantic City. That's a lot of people on that beach. Never seen a colored on the beach. This is definitely directed more at the Jews then. The school year begins in one week... and all schools will implement the new integration law. Baltimore school district officials do not anticipate any problems... implementing the new law. Summer faded away. The "summer faded away" and what? The end of summer. A composition of what you did last summer. It's hard to read. What's that word? "Jewish." - "Jewish, " I think. - "Jewish"? I'll be back in a little while. Like clockwork. If it's Rosh Hashanah, Nate and Charlie must pay a visit. What can I say? It's tradition. The cantor sings, that's our cue to see the new Caddy. Pretty. Pretty in green. They call it "mist green." Is that what they call it? I thought you'd look at the convertible. Ada keeps talking four doors, convenience. Carl Zeitsoff was in. I told him you were coming to see the new Caddies. 6-9-9. He always bets the same number. For 10 years it is the same number. It would've been a shock if it was another number. Any price increase this year? Let's look at the paperwork. I haven't had a chance to look it over. It just literally came in. Get a haircut. I'm letting it grow like Samson's. How are the coloreds doing in school? They're doing good. They're getting better grades than I am. Girl's attractive. What? She's attractive. Just kill me now. Just kill me now. What? What do you mean? Pretty. Oh, my God! I said she was attractive. That doesn't mean I'm attracted to her. She's attractive. Where's the jawbone of the ass? The jawbone of the ass. Where is it? Is he crazy? What talk is this? Your ass does not have a jawbone. Samson fought the Philistines with the jawbone of an ass. - Not your ass. An animal. - There's an animal called an "ass"? Such a mouth. Look, I loved Samson and Delilah. I hope they bring that movie back. "He slew hundreds with the jawbone of an ass." Do you believe this stuff? I don't know. What do you mean? It's in the Bible. That makes it true? It's in the Bible. A story. Yeah, a true story? It's not the question if it's true. If it's in the Bible, it's for a reason. What reason? A good reason! That's the reason? It's there. He had long hair. He was strong. He knocked the building down. He killed the goyim. - Finish of the story. - There weren't gentiles yet. Pagans. Pagans, schmagans, gentiles. Something, but not Jewish. We know. If they're not Jewish, they're... the other kind. Go make yourselves busy. Your father's not gonna be home for almost an hour. Go watch television. - They call it "mist green." - I think it's "green mist." Tell Louie to park the car in back. We'll be coming out for dinner. - Do Ada and the boys like it? - Benny likes convertibles. Can I help you? I'm here to see the-the-the... The physician. - What's the thought? - I don't know. But burlesque is finished. TV puts us in the shithouse. How often can you watch Milton Berle wear a dress? There's a lot of good shows. Did you see Marty? "What do you wanna do, Marty?" "What do you wanna do?" What are you talking about? Guy can't get a date. He's shy. He's a butcher. - Do I care? - I thought you saw it. "Ma, I'm an ugly man. I'm a butcher. Nobody wants me." Don't you understand the problem I've got? I have to declare to the IRS that I make more... with this burlesque house than I do... to keep them off my ass, or they'll start looking at what else I do. Last time I looked, running a numbers racket was illegal. God forbid they look in the audience, see how many people we have. To be a realist... we've got two years in this joint, tops. So where are they-? Where are you from? Don't get personal. Let me listen to your heart. The new Caddy this year costs more. Next year, more still. Same dollars from our take on the numbers is not good business. Everybody, put on your thinking caps... and figure how we can raise the revenue. I think we can do better. Everybody's waiting for me on a Rosh Hashanah dinner. I got an idea. Put on your thinking caps. We don't need an answer now. Nate, I got something good. Make it quick. We introduce a fourth digit as a bonus number. Double the pot. How do you pay for it? It's 10 percent of the original bet. If it's 50 cents, it's an additional 5 cents; 60 cents, 6 cents... 70 cents, 7 cents; A buck, 10 cents... If a person is a Communist or a Socialist, what does that mean? If you're a Communist and wanna blow up a building... or sell secrets to a spy, that's different. But if you believe in different economics, it should have no effect. - Period. - Well, I can't write that. I could. You just can't read it. Such a sloppy writer. It won't look good if you get older. I have no idea what this has to do with McCarthy. McCarthy pushes his ideals and beliefs... with intimidation, and that is very dangerous. What do I wear for Halloween? You always change the subject. Why do you always go off on a tangent? I'm thinking McCarthy, witch hunts... witches, Halloween. What do I wear? Go as a pirate. See? Your grandmother has the perfect solution. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me... in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil... You stuck on Sylvia? I saw you eyeing her during the 23rd Psalm. I was watching her pray. She was really into it. I mean, her head was bowed, her eyes were closed. She was really praying. - Would you take her out? - You kidding? Not in public. You know, on the sly or something. Look, Sheldon, I was watching her pray. I was wondering what she was thinking. I was curious. You know, colored girls are great with sex. - That so? - Proven fact. - Where do you get your facts? - I accumulate this information. For one, colored guys got huge schlongs. Twice the size of a white guy's. Where do you come up with this? Unless you haven't noticed... we got a colored guy in our class. Wilbert Mosley. I took a shower with him. Mine's all shriveled up from the water. I got maybe an inch. His is halfway down to his knees, I swear to God. Give me a break. I swear to God, his knees. It was giving me an inferiority complex. So I'm thinking this circumcision thing we have done... it's not just about clipping innocent foreskin. It's about stunting its growth. You gotta be kidding. - I'm talking about Wilbert's schlong. - Humongous. He didn't believe me. See that girl? Wilbert could tap her from here. It's tied to his leg when it's not in use. Good guy. Smart as shit. Lets me cheat off him. Ben is taken with Sylvia. Would you give it a rest? - My parents would die. - Your parents? Her father's a big doctor at Provident Hospital. Wealthy. You're way too low-class. You try to take her out, her father would flip. Plus you're Jewish. Give it 45 minutes. You gotta take a shower with Wilbert. You will be amazed. You gotta be kidding. See you later, Ma. Ben's upstairs. You're not getting dressed? I'm a beatnik. That's some outfit. Ben, let's go! You're gonna go as reindeers? - We're Vikings. - Vikings? They're from here? Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Ada! Oh, my God. Have you lost your mind? Have you completely lost your mind? What do you mean? It's Halloween. There's something wrong with this boy. He's a lunatic. Bubbe, the war was over forever ago. I can't breathe. Where do you think you're going? To a party. It's Halloween. You are not leaving this house dressed as Adolf Hitler! It's Halloween. That's the joke. Couldn't you have gone as a pirate? Or a reindeer? Take that off, or I call your father. You are not going out of this house! It took me forever to get this costume. I had to go to Sunny Surplus downtown to get boots like these! Adolf Hitler is in the hallway. I'm calling your father now. You are not going out. What do you guys think? It might be a tad too much. If we got this new system worked out with the numbers... we should start. It's the end of October. We should go with it second week in November. Let me see if we can nail down a date. Gaiety. Pete, put Nate on the phone. He looks like Adolf Hitler? He can stay in the house all night. He's not going out dressed as Hitler. Your father says you're not going out dressed that way. And I'm not changing. He says he's not changing. I wanna talk to Hitler. He has a swastika on his arm and big black boots! He's wearing big black boots! He came down the stairs in them with swastikas all over! Put the Führer on the phone. Your father wants to talk to you. Sorry. You guys can go without me. You sure? Yeah, I'm having Halloween here. What's wrong with boys today? They have no sense of history. The war ended when he was 7. It's now nine years later. To a kid, that's a lifetime. To us, it's a blink of an eye. Why does my kid have to dress up like Hitler? - He's not going trick-or-treating? - No. "Trick or treat. Hitler's here." That'd look great in our neighborhood. That's good. We have to cross Falls Road to get to this party. Yeah, so? Gentile turf. Nick Campbell said this is gonna be a good party. I don't know. Across Falls Road. Oh, boy. Get ready, folks! Jews are a-coming! So where do you live? Forest Park. Forest Park? Off Liberty Heights. That's Jewish, isn't it? Damn near, yeah. Lot of Jews. Seems more is moving in too, you know? It's getting that way. Halt! Do not shpritz on the general! I go to the University of Baltimore. That's nice. My major is economics. It's sort of a set subject. Not much room for expressionism, you know? Yeah, right. I don't get to talk to people much. Do you know everyone here? These are all your friends? Yes, we all go to school together. - Pretty much. - Nice people. Excuse me. Oh, my God! Say, does that magic wand make any wish come true? It hasn't worked yet. What did you wish for? Well, that's too personal a question. I didn't mean to be too personal. Sorry. Are you afraid of being too intimate? Or do you prefer small talk? Kind of got me off guard. Should I be more predictable? Be whatever your heart desires. Close your eyes. Make a wish. Was that it? How you doing? You didn't know? Okay. She's your girl. I'm very sorry. I didn't know. There isn't a guy who doesn't know that I go with Mary. Here I am. You found one, okay? No hard feelings. Wait a minute, smart guy. Got a question. Where you from? I'm from Forest Park. Jewish? What's your point? It's just a question. - Do you have a point? - It's just a question. I'm not here to answer your stupid questions. Stop it! Ted, it was nothing! I'm just asking if he was Jewish. No big deal. Fuck you, Tab Hunter. - Stop it, Ted! - Get off me! Not inside! Outside! Outside. Fine. Outside. Jesus! He won't even say he's Jewish. Oh, shit. - Give me a beer. - Get me one too. Not now. Van, we got trouble. It's Yussel. I'm sorry, excuse me. I'll be right back. I'm gonna kill you guys. Okay, listen up. This is between us, all right? Nobody interferes. Hold on a second, all right? Come here. What are you doing? What did I tell you? What did I tell you? I said that crossing Falls Road was a mistake! I'll get you out of this. Will you relax? Stop. What are you doing? Stop acting like this. I'm gonna bury this blond bastard, and then we'll get out of here. Come on. I'm just gonna slap you. Come on. It's a really simple question. Are you Jewish? Get up! Come on! All you have to do is say it, and it's over. It's really a simple question. Are you Jewish? You say it, it's over. Okay? That's enough, Ted! Say it! Say it! Say it, and it's over! Jesus Christ! What kind of party is this? Let's go, slugger. No, I'm okay. I had him set up, believe me. Some great strategy. Trey! Trey, are you all right? You okay? I'm good. The night is young. He was getting winded. Where's that girl? Forget that girl. Let's get the hell out of here. What girl's he talking about? What are you doing? Let's go. Let's go! You missed a little fisticuff back there. This is very unfortunate. You know, it's obvious the smiling pumpkins distracted me. Cinderella! Okay, let's go, let's go. Now. We gotta get out of here! Does this thing open? What are you doing? Can I see you sometime? Let's go. Now. You know, that-Will you guys give me a break for a minute? Wait a minute! Cinderella! I'm gonna kill you. - Got any beer? - I know they have hard liquor. Let's see what we can dig up. Sorry I'm late for the ball, sweetheart. Well, that's a first for you. Little cut there. Tried to park. I didn't even get her name. Story's all over the place. This guy talked his date into blowing a horse. How do you talk her into blowing a horse? - Don't believe it, then. - Get back to logic. Where's a horse in Washington, unless it's a police horse? And where's the cop? Exactly. Nice feathers, boys. Where's Ben? - He's at home celebrating. - I knew they wouldn't let him out. He's stubborn. - Tell me about it. - You hear about Sinatra? We're going to the movie, getting out of the car. He says, "Can't get out until Sinatra finishes." I tried to get out. He grabs me and yells, "No one walks out on Sinatra." We had to listen to the song, then go. - Like I don't know. - We were late for the movie. I didn't understand it until two hours into it. - That's impossible. - It is. You think about it. Why spend a night with any kind of horse... when you can have Francis the Talking Mule? He's a mule. - A mule! - That's another thing. It's not as big a feat if you blow a mule. Is a mule or horse bigger? I'd have to say a horse, because mules are incapable of reproducing. How do they reproduce? They're incapable of reproducing. They don't. Do they have sperm? - How do they make more mules? - They breed horses and donkeys. - How could you not get her name? - I was flummoxed. - She did the thing with the wand- - Good luck finding her. I got a bad case of blue balls right now. I love this girl. You'll be in love alone. She's history. I am not going back over there... with that Tab Hunter. That son of a bitch. He wanted to know. When was the last time you wanted to know if someone was Catholic? Or Episcopalian or Methodist? Who gives a shit? What's the difference between all those groups? They all pray to Christ. It's fine to have a Jew hanging over the bed. Just don't have him come through the front door. A dead Jew is okay. I think that's the operative word. Go figure. They all pray to a Jew. In a way, they're all reformed Jews at heart. I gotta find this girl. You're gonna have to pray to God. A gentile God, mind you. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness... for His name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... I will fear no evil... for Thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest... a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runneth over. - Goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life... and I will dwell in the house of the Lord... forever. Amen. You got into a real brouhaha this weekend. You already heard? I had a police officer at my door. Why? That fight was no big deal. No, about the car crash. - Why's a cop come and see you? - About you guys. Us? Why? The cop said he heard that you were eyewitnesses to the accident. A lot of people saw that. Why do they need us? I don't know. The guys must be goofing with us. A lot of people saw this. They don't need us. The cops said Trey Travelstead was driving recklessly... and running pumpkins over. He ran through the patio, and there were three guys from another part of town. I knew names. What, you gave the cops our names? It wasn't a big deal. That's terrific, you know? Come here. There was this girl there. I flipped out on her. She was incredible. - What's her name? - I don't know. You know them. Maybe you could ask around. What does she look like? She's gorgeous. Blond. She looked like Cinderella. She dressed like Cinderella. She had a magic wand and everything. Cinderella didn't have a magic wand. It's not important if Cinderella had a wand. This girl had one. Help me find this girl with the magic wand. She's gorgeous, blond and carries a magic wand. I'm Ben. I'm in your homeroom. I know. Where are you going? I thought you lived around school. Downtown. I'm going downtown. Can I ask you a question? I guess. I always watch you say the 23rd Psalm, and you seem so... you seem so absorbed. Why? Why do you ask? I've never seen someone so reverential, I guess. For me, it's just a moment to myself, that's all. The big question is you. Me? Yeah, well, you're Jewish. So what's the 23rd Psalm about for you? I never really thought of it as religious. It's just something I've been saying since first grade. And? Well, I always thought of the 23rd Psalm like the national anthem. It's just something you say before the game starts. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. What does that mean to you? Honestly? No idea. No idea? Nobody's making me lie down... and I don't know where these green pastures are. Has anyone ever anointed your head with oil? Has your cup ever runneth over? No, it hasn't. I'm going downtown. It's my stop. I thought you lived downtown. Is that where I'm supposed to live? Wait! Sylvia, wait. Can I walk with you? Can I walk with you? I don't know if this is a good idea. I mean, we're getting close to my house. My father comes home in the afternoon on occasion. He would not be thrilled to see me walking home with a white boy. I understand. - Sorry. - It's okay. You know what? Wait here. I'll get my mom's car and pick you up. Get in fast, and get on the floor. I talked with our guys. I'm getting great feedback on the bonus bet. Mr. Kurtzman? My costume didn't arrive here. What should I do? Did you call suppliers? They said it should be here, but it's not, so I think it's lost. You'll just have to make do with what's in storage. No. I only wear my own outfits, and they're very expensive. What can I tell you? I'm not wearing... anybody else's costume on my body. Do I need this? Get in. Hurry up. Come on. - Get on the floor. - What? Get on the floor. Is this really necessary? He's really good. You never heard him before? No, I only listen to the regular radio. You listen to "regular radio"? What is this? What am I listening to? The other kind of- The other radio stations. There's a place near the zoo. No one will see us there. I think we should go to the zoo. Yeah, great. Good. The zoo. Does your dad know Cab Calloway? Why would you ask that? Well, he went to Douglass High. You know, the Negro school. No, he doesn't. What about Billie Holiday? What, just because we're Negro, we should know all the Negroes? I don't know. Maybe. Do you know Albert Einstein, then? No, but I think my family knows some of the Einsteins. Are you serious? You think she could find one outfit? She's got some germ thing. She doesn't like to wear anybody else's stuff. This is very unique. I've got a stripper who's dressed like my cousin Marcia. This is nuts. The odds on finding this girl are like one in a million. Trust me, okay? I have a feeling she's there. We have to find the neighborhood... and she has to be coincidentally... walking around at this time. Nick Campbell is checking her out. You can't give him time? I can't. I can't wait. She's on my mind all the time. What are we supposed to do? Just look for the glow of the girl's tiara? I think I see somebody with a magic wand. If you guys would stop talking and look around, please. She'll be the one person walking around? I hope she doesn't hurt herself. Where the hell are we right now? Where are we? I don't know. We must've left the area. - Great! - I'm sorry. I have other things on my mind. This neighborhood makes me nervous. Three guys were walking around with tools. I'll get us out of here. You know, there's no such thing as a dream girl. Do you think that my father thought that my mother was a dream girl? No way! Let me tell you something. This girl- I am obsessed- This is meant to be. Preordained. Dream girls were invented by God to tease the apparatus. That's all. You settle for less. - That's not the point. - What is? Dream girls. I'd rather not be looking for my dream girl... which I had to leave because you were fighting! Do me a favor. Lose my number. I don't know if I wanna continue this relationship. Come on! Come on! I think she's gonna go too far. We're going to jail. Damn good act. Some show. Best in years. If she starts showing breasts without tassels, kill the spot. If she takes off her underwear, kill the spot. Nate, no! Nate, but- No "buts." This is some act. For 23 people. I wasn't finished yet. That's as much as you can show. I wasn't gonna show more. I was gonna give it a proper ending. Do it tomorrow. My costume should be here by then. This is your costume from now on. You like? I like. You? He likes. I like. I don't want you going out tonight. Just going on the porch. So what's the news? What's the big secret? I was with Sylvia. In her car. No, her car? Her mother's car. You got laid. Bare tit? You ever hear Negro music? I need details. No, it was nothing like that. The music's great. What the hell did you do? We talked. Talked? Bullshit. No. I mean, we talked. I hear they got soft skin. I didn't touch her. No details, I'm going home. No. We talked a lot. I mean, we talked about Negro singers and comics. It was great, unbelievable. She blew you. - I don't believe you. - Why would I tell you I was with her? I don't know. You talked with a colored girl about comedy and music. That's bullshit. All in all, the take is up 9%. Good, good. Get a chair. We're even getting some white business. Coloreds and white betting numbers together. Does the heart good. Look. Germantown, good. Greektown, good. Even Pigtown. All white areas, they all show a bump. I hear the state is thinking of a lottery. Lukie Saperstein's been pushing that since the war. It's popular in Annapolis. They want new revenue. They should legalize gambling. Vegas is going through the roof. They've already got slots in Anne Arundel County. The farchadat government. They think they could run a numbers racket? Lottery! It's unconstitutional. They're taking money out of the mouth of the entrepreneur. Smacks of socialism. The government integrates the golf course in '51 and schools in '54. Where's their priorities? They integrated cricket in '50. Can't find a colored playing cricket. That was part of the separate-but-equal ruling. Coloreds could only play on Tuesdays. You can't find one to play on Tuesday, Wednesday or kiss-my-tochis day. You can't find a white person who wants to play cricket. It makes no sense. How many players do you need? They use a mallet? - Is that with hoops? - That's croquet. - Croquet is something you eat. - Everything is something you eat. I saw it in the menu. Charlie, keep an eye on this. Just what we need. A state lottery. Who is gonna testify first? It's alphabetical, I guess. You know, I tell you, I still cannot believe that we have to testify. Trey Travelstead must've come on the Mayflower with Pilgrims. You know, that whole Pilgrim thing makes me very uneasy. Very uneasy. Alan, what time you got? It's 12:30. We have to be in court at 2. Let me ask you a stupid question. You know all these lawyer shows. Perry Mason, the others. They say in court, "Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?" The witness always says, "Yeah." What if you say "no"? What do you mean? "I'll tell you what I know, but I won't swear to God." What happens? Got me. Interesting. I'll ask a law student. Let's try it today. Who? Whoever's called first. - It's good by me. - It's good by you? Yeah, why not? - No, that's good by me. - He's in. Prosecution calls Sylvan Kurtzman to the stand. Put your left hand on this Bible. Raise your right hand. You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help you God? No. What? No. What's going on here? You're a Communist! Nothing but a Commie! Your Honor, he's a Red! I'm telling you... he's godless! - Order! - You're a pinko! Order! Order! You're a Communist! Order in the court! I'd like to call a 10-minute recess. Counselors, see me in chambers. - You may step down. - Thank you, sir. The guy's got some serious balls. Gotta give him credit. Every year, 50 or 60 Negroes pass for white. You can't tell them apart, because they don't smile... so you can't see their gums. So if you got a white friend that talks like this: "Haven't seen you in a long time, pal. " You open that sucker's mouth up, it might be one of them. I didn't go to college myself, but I saw a lot of people go. No, I didn't dig school. Knowing when Washington crossed the Delaware... wouldn't help me in a brick fight. They got nothing about ducking bricks in history. I've never heard anything like this. It's great, isn't it? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. No matter what color you are, when the lights go out... it becomes a question of "Who washed?" Mr. Kurtzman, you could be held in contempt of court... and I may have ruled so... but the prosecution has decided not to pursue this action. - So you may step down. - Thank you, Your Honor. Court calls Alan Zuckerman to the stand. - State your full name. - Alan Joseph Zuckerman. Place your left hand on this Bible. Raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help you God? Yes. Be seated. Where were you on the night of October 28, 1954? - The night of the accident? - Objection. We have not established the nature of the accident... or that an accident did in fact occur. Objection sustained. Answer the question. Well, if that wasn't the night of the accident... then I don't know where I was. You gotta give me some kind of hint. Was that Halloween? I just wanted to thank you for helping out. It wasn't really about you. If there's anything I can do for you, don't hesitate. I certainly feel indebted. Look, we'd like to offer an apology to your friend. Ted was out of line. - I didn't mean the way it came across. - Forget about it. You know what? Maybe you can help me. There was this girl at the party who was a knockout. I don't know her name, but I'd really like to find out. - What did she look like? - She was beautiful. Blond. She was wearing this princess or Cinderella kind of costume. You found her attractive? She knocked me out. Sound familiar? I guess. We'll ask around. Give me your number. Yeah, sure thing. She's blond. Had a magic wand. Thanks. I'll call. Great. What are you doing? He was talking about Dubbie. Your girl, last time I asked. He's a good guy. We'll get another girl. There must be one he'd like. What about Maggie? She's to die for. Maggie, Caroline, Megan, one of them. One bed, one record. I'm sorry. Did I do that? Well... I'm sorry. Does it happen that easily? Not that I know of. No. It just goes off like that? Well, I think... I've been worked up, you know, all along, and... You don't like the records? No. I like the records. I just think if it's... well, been percolating for a long time... it's got no place to go. You have to use the bathroom? It's right over there. Around the corner. I'll be right back. So do you think maybe we could do this tomorrow? Well, I hope so. If my mom's out. Oh, my God. It's my father. - What do I do? - Get in the closet. What are you doing? Don't you have homework? I was just taking a break. - Your mother call? - No. But she said this morning to expect her early evening. Get back to your homework. What's going on? I have a boy over. But it was nothing. We were just listening to records. That's it. And where is he? He's in the closet. If nothing went on, why is he in the closet? Because he's white. How could you do such a thing? We didn't do anything. What's his name? Ben Kurtzman. - Mr. Kurtzman? - Yes, sir. Sylvia is not allowed to be with a white boy. It's not respectful. I was respectful, sir. - You're in my daughter's bedroom. - Yes, sir. Mr. Kurtzman. Would you come out of the closet? Yes, sir. Now? I don't ever wanna see you with my daughter again. At school you will be respectful and cordial... but no activities outside school. Is that clear? Yes, sir. I just don't think- It's very clear to my daughter. Don't you agree, Sylvia? Yes. Now, will you please leave? He needs a ride home. I'll drive him. Sylvia, you will remain here. - This is your house? - Yes, sir. Shouldn't you be getting out? It's Sinatra, sir. So? You don't walk out on Frank, sir. I mean, it would be too disrespectful. I gotta go. Okay, it's over now. Good night, sir. This is it. 2-2-3. The bonus was 4. Listen. Do you know what that means on $50? - $ 100,000. - We're screwed! Screwed is not the word. - Who bets $50 on a number? - Nobody bets $50. Nobody bets $50. What do we got in reserve? We don't have enough to cover the bet. Tell him, but he's at dinner! I will call. All right? - He's gonna kill me. - It's ringing. Thanks, Ma. What's up? You're not gonna believe this. I'm sick to my stomach. Charlie, what? Somebody hit the number and the bonus. The payout is $ 100,000. A hundred thousand-?! Oh, my God. Are you sure? I checked it six times over. Jesus! We don't have that kind of money. I'm coming down. What's happening? I've gotta go. We've got problems. He's Little Melvin. Colored drug dealer on Pennsylvania Avenue. Sells reefer. Strictly smalltime. Bets 50 to celebrate his mother's birthday. This wipes me out. Little Melvin called. He's coming by to pick up his haul. - You didn't let on? - No, no. Listen, Nate, I feel responsible. The bonus was my idea. To hell with this apology shit. I bought the idea. Nobody bets 50 on a number. A nickel, a dime, a buck. Five, tops. $50, never. It's unheard of! What'll we do? We don't have a lot of time to find a solution. So how come we never talk about what Dad does? Because it's illegal. But not that bad. Is everything gonna be all right? Your father takes care of himself. Why don't you tell them about Patterson Park? What about Patterson Park? When your father was a teenager, he went over to Patterson Park. Why, I'll never know. He saw some guys playing ball, and he tried to get into the game. One of the guys asked if your father was Jewish. He said he was. One thing led to another, and your father was beaten up. Black and blue. After that, he went to the J. C. C. Every day after school to learn to box. For six months, he trained every day. Then he went back to Patterson Park. Got up on a car and yelled: "There's a Jew in the neighborhood! Anyone who doesn't like it, step up." He beat up seven guys that day. Your father takes care of himself. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul. - and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen. Mr. Melvin. I'm thinking of giving you the southeast territory. You take over the numbers. Long-term dollars. You trying to Jew me out my money? Watch your tongue. I don't take shit from no Heb. You coon, I'll put my fist down your throat! You hook-nosed kike! Little Melvin don't take shit from nobody! You're a dead man, you bush-monkey burrhead! I ain't scared of nobody! Back him up! Back him up! Stop it! Goddamn it! Stop it! Stop it! We've all come too far to stoop to this. Charlie, get Little Melvin his money. He won't see the big picture, that's his problem. What's my problem? I apologize. You make yourself comfortable. Charlie's gonna get your money. Exactly how big a picture is this here big picture? The southeast territory generates just under 10 grand a month. In less than a year, you've got payback. After that, it's "ka-ching," day in, day out. That's what I had in mind. Week in, week out? It's your call. You go for the short-term money... or you go for the long haul. All mine, now? Clean? No middleman? Why you giving up the territory then? Look, there's no question that 100,000 cuts into my cash flow. I can live with that. But this burlesque, it's too time-consuming. You get a little older, your priorities change. That was a good decision. You better keep a leash on the Pillsbury Jew-boy over there. - The money? - Bigger things on the horizon. How can we give him the southeast territory? The wops own it. Wait a couple days, call Little Melvin... say the southeast territory won't work out. We have to put a new deal on the table. And let him pick the meeting spot. Make him feel good. Phone book. All right, students, settle down. Put your books on your head. I slipped you two tickets. The Royal, Friday night. I think you'll like the acts. For the two of us? I mean, isn't that a colored place? Bring a friend, and I'll go with a friend. We won't sit together. Is it safe? Don't worry. Do you think if a bomb fell, this book would save my life? I don't know. Last year, we had to lie on the floor. It's a different position now. One time, it was the atomic bomb. Another time, the hydrogen bomb. Hydrogen can't get through this book. Come to the Royal. Sylvia got me two tickets to see James Brown at the Royal. - Who? - James Brown. Who's he? He's a singer. - The Royal. Isn't that...? - A colored theater? Problem is, I can only take one of you. I don't wanna make the decision, so you guys can battle that out. - Yeah, well... - Doesn't matter. She's taking a friend, and I have to choose a friend. I don't wanna choose. She's taking a friend? A colored girl? I assume so. - Do you think-? - I'll go. You wanna go? You think she'd put out? I don't know. I'm really into James Burn. James Brown. We're going to the show. I'll sit with one of you guys. She'll sit with her friend. We all go home. There's probably time for- A little putting out. We're not even sitting together. - I'm sure she'll put out. - You're sure of this? Sheldon told me all colored girls... It's not that kind of thing. Well, you know what would make it that kind of thing? Something called "Spanish fly." - Spanish fly? - They will go nuts for us. Give them Spanish fly? We're not sitting together. That stuff is dangerous. There was this girl in Highlandtown. She rubbed that all over her body. You don't rub- You take the pill. In Highlandtown, they rub it. The point of the story is, she rubs it all over her body. She gets so wild, she mounts a stick shift in the car. She dies. She died, Sheldon. Which one of you will it be? - Me. - We'll flip a coin. - Heads. - Tails. Who is it? Trey Travelstop. You know a name like this? Yes, I'll accept. Where are you? I didn't know you go to Washington and Lee. When? Tomorrow? Yeah, that sounds like fun. Get off the phone, Bubbe. Off the phone. I'll meet you at your house. Give me the address. Yeah, well, hope she's there. All right, see you, Trey. Hope she's there. Your mind. I'd have to say. It's kind of wonderful. There's $40,000 there. You about 60 grand shy, ain't you? Well, we've got a problem. That's just to show our good faith. First, the southeast territory don't work out. Now you come here with this shit? You some tricky guys, ain't you? I've got a car that's worth 3600... a home that's worth 18 to 20 thousand. I've got nothing to hide. I'm letting you hold the deed, and each week you'll get 2000. I won straight up! This here's some bullshit. I'll call the Better Business Bureau. That'll work. It's the best I can do. This about the grocery-bag test? What's that mean? Skin darker than the bag is low-class. Man don't get the respect he deserves. They say if you wear a horseshoe ring in that direction... all the good luck tends to run out. That's the way you see it. I see it a whole different way. If white men get luck in one direction, colored men get luck a different way. And that is a fact. And you've got Those baby eyes. - Did he go for it? - We'll see. Nice Caddy. I ain't seen this color before. Do you like it? Take it. Louie, call us a cab. I want my money. And I want all of it. You can't buy me off. I'm doing the best I can. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm having dinner with my family. Let's go. You don't take me seriously. A man in my position makes his presence felt. Get your hands off me. What? Dad, can I take the Cadillac? Where you going? Out! - All right, but drive carefully. - Thanks! Not too late! Yeah, Mom. I'm here to see Trey Travelstead. You said that his family had money. They got a butler. Look at these rugs. They couldn't get wall-to-wall? Squeaky floors. With wall-to-wall, you don't have this problem. These are piece-of-shit throw rugs. Look at this piece of crap. Look at this piece of crap. You know, this has to be 80 years old, if it's a day. You know? They can't spring for a new one? No wonder they have money. They must save every nickel. - They must like this old stuff. - It's old. It's very old. When did they last make a purchase? 1906? From bad to worse. Look at this. You know what my parents just got? A Formica table. Get anything on that, and it cleans right up. Nice hair. You guys ready to roll? I know what I'm doing. You realize we're the only white people here, right? Really? There's Sylvia and her friend. Don't draw attention. What's your name? This is Gail. Let me ask you guys a question. We just finished reading Death of a Salesman. Is that a play about a Jewish family? I don't know. Arthur Miller wrote it, and he's Jewish. I mean, Willy Loman, salesman. Except the boys' names. Biff and Happy? That's a crazy name, "Biff." He wanted to avoid that whole Jewish thing. - What thing? - You know. What do they say? "What was that play that we saw? That Jewish play that we saw? It was good. About the Jewish family." Not a salesman play. A Jewish salesman play. He wanted to make it universal. I'll grant you this, there are few Jewish ballplayers. True. Very true. You'll never hear, "Ground ball to short. Flo Ziegfield scoops it to Leonard Bernstein at second... who fires to first. George Gershwin stretches. Double play!" That's not gonna happen. This is a much larger party than that Halloween thing. We were just slumming at that one. That was slumming? When do we slum again? This is nice. This is some farm. I believe it's a land grant from the king. Grant. Kings don't grant Jews shit. Not now, okay? Not now. That's Maggie Ridgley. I'd pop her. Sally Breckenridge. Her dad's with DuPont. I'd pop her too. She would see. She would know. The one in the white hat is Anne Whittier. That's your best bet. - Very easy. - Fabulous. I don't see the little princess. I'm getting something to drink. Do me a favor. Don't call me Yussel tonight. - What do you want me to call you? - Yates. The Royal should be jumping tonight. Sure enough. Wait a minute. That look like Kurtzman's car. He got that nice Caddy, and he won't give up the cash? He got you on the layaway plan. Don't make me moody, all right? Believe me. He'd pay the whites off on the spot. It's a damn nice color, though, ain't it? - You should've asked him for the car. - He offered. Threw me the keys and everything. - Hell, I should have. - Damn right. Let me find that son of a bitch, take him up on that offer. Man takes advantage. Yeah, well, I'm gonna take that goddamn car. He got to be around here somewhere. What he doing down here anyway? I don't know. White boy like that stick out like a sore thumb. I'm glad to be here at the Royal in beautiful Baltimore, Maryland! How you doing? Any whites inside? Saw two. You mind if I take a look? I'll be right back. - Go ahead. - Thank you kindly. Stay there. I can't go in the show? You're looking lovely this evening. You look like a double scoop of chocolate. And I got a sweet tooth. And you still can't go in. Yeah, so let me ask you, Yates? - It's a very unusual name. - It is. It's Scandinavian actually. My mom was born in Norway. My father was born in Denmark. They met in Sweden. So it sort of covers the whole Nordic spectrum. It sure does. The shit just hit the fan. - Thought she went to Paris. - That's what she told me. Wish me luck. You're gonna need it. So this is Paris. Just couldn't bring myself to go. Yeah, well, Paris is tough. Please don't be snide. It's my father. I just can't deal with him right now. He looks familiar. I saw him when I came riding in. Think Halloween. He's crazy for you. The night you stood me up for most of the evening. - I flirted with him for amusement. - You did quite a job. He's salivating for you. How do you know? I brought him here. Does he know we go together? Didn't wanna break his heart. Please. Spare me your sensitive side. Say hello. I won't get jealous. Screw you. I don't get it. Love her? Hate her? Can't live without her? Never wanna see her again? Ain't it romantic? You're too much. Guys would die for her. I think I will. Hello, stranger. You remembered. Certainly. How could I forget? Let's get something to drink. So where are you coming on a horse? - Did I say James Brown was my cousin? - Is that right? He should've left you a ticket. You just stay right out here. Couple of white kids. One of them probably Kurtzman's kid. What do you wanna do? You should've asked for the car. Don't make me moody, all right? Hold on, now. What if I take his kid? He got my money. I got his kid. Right about now, I'd like to do a song... that I hope to record real soon. Hope to make it my very first record. Fellas, are you ready? Building, you ready? We're gonna tear you down. Please! Please! Please! Please! Darling, please. Don't go. I love you so. Baby, you did me wrong. You done me wrong. Told you darling You done me wrong. Took my love And now you're gone. I love you! I'm sorry. I didn't know about you and Trey. Trey should've said something, but that's Trey. He really should've... because it really would've saved me a lot of aggravation. You know, that night when I saw you in the basement, I was so... It wasn't a real magic wand. Guess not. Teach him who he dicking with. A man win big, and he can't get his due? And it ain't kidnapping. It's more tit for tat. You do nothing on your own. I've never seen anything like that in my life. Wait. Careful. I'm really glad you liked it. It was worth it, wasn't it? Please, please. Where are you parked? Just through the alley. We're up here. How about we get someone... to buy us a six-pack of beer and drink it in your car? Drink it in my car? We could just sit in the car. I have a curfew. I can't do that. We don't have to go anywhere. Please. I don't think so. Please, please. How you all doing this evening? Which one is Nate Kurtzman's kid? Me. That so? Get in the car. You all take a walk. No. Get your ass out of here. I'm not leaving him here. You can either get in the car or get out of here. - I'll get in the car. - Right. Everybody get in the car. - Then what? 3? - 3-0-4. Shalom. Is Mr. Kurtzman there? He just left? Well, when will he be back? Got it. Went down to the Gaiety. Should be there soon. If my dad had the money, he'd give it to you. Two black, two white. - You all dating? - No. We happened to meet. Ben, Sheldon and I go to the same school. I go to Douglass. Cab Calloway went to Douglass. Something going on between you two? We're just friends. Friends? White guy, colored girl, friends? I ain't never heard of such a thing. New to me too. You plugging her? - Why not? She good-looking. - We're just friends. I never had a white friend in my entire life. Now, I done work for white... and I been messed over by white. But we ain't never been friends. I don't get to be in the business world like you Jews. Jews are a minority too, you know. Oh, that so? Did you know there are less Jews in the world than Negroes? But you ain't got the skin thing. Slaves, slaves. Jews were slaves. Bullshit! Who built the pyramids? How in the hell should I know? The Jews. Jews built the pyramids? I didn't know that. Pull them big stones? Jews? It's true. When was that? 3500 years ago, something like that. 3500?! Don't you tell me about no slave thing happened 3500 years ago. I'm talking about my granddaddy was a slave! Thousands of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the earth... and stuff was coming out of the dirt. Don't you make fun of my suffering. Oh, come on! I'm going with Dubbie. You know your way back? What'll you do? Ride off on the horse? We're staying here with some friends. That's depressing. I'm sorry about all this. I didn't know she'd be here. I thought you'd spark to someone else. That's all right. Maybe next time, you know? I'll let you know about the next to-do. - Thanks. - I'm sorry. I'll see you later, pal. Looks like Yussel's doing fine. Maybe I should dye my hair. Maybe. See you. I'm glad you see it that way, Mr. Kurtzman. Just a negotiation. Tit for tat. It's nice doing business with you too. No. No. I'll call you back about the meeting place. Scribbles, go let them three kids out. It'll be over in a minute. Little children. All three of you out. Kurtzman, you stay. Come on, now. Get out, girl. I'll wait. Let's take a ride in the Pontiac. - How old are you, little girl? - How much do you weigh? That's a sassy one. Ain't you loyal! I don't want anything to happen. Ain't nothing gonna happen, his father pays. You sure you're not plugging her? - Yeah, I'm sure. - You gotta find her good-looking. I do. Touch her titty. - What? - No. Go on, touch her titty. This says yes. Don't give me shit. Ain't like it's a naked titty. Think about it. There's nothing to think about. No. If you want your money, you'd better call again. I was getting ready to do that. I was just having a moment of entertainment. Thank you. But I'm not sure it would've been worth dying for. Anything goes wrong, I'll never forgive myself. - He's not gonna hurt him. - Should've been straight with him. It'll be all right. It's not the way this guy operates. - It's yours. - Can't take this. Your car. Little Kurtzman. Didn't have to give him the entire numbers business. Could've gone 50-50. Or kill him. Gotta love the guineas. Colored guy steals something from them... they find him dead on his own doorstep two days later. A subtle warning. He didn't steal. He hit the number. He won it fair and square. It's his money. And you. You wanna explain this? She's in my class. She came out of the Royal when it happened. You went to the Royal. Why? James Brown. He's amazing. Is this that rock 'n' roll? It's great music. Well, maybe you should get her in the car. This is my dad. Frightening night. Yeah, somewhat. Did you call your parents? They think I'm sleeping over at Gail's house tonight. That saves a complicated explanation. I don't know how I'd tell my father. Dubbie, hey. Trey? How serious? When did he go into surgery? 421 Springdale Avenue. It's right off Liberty Heights. Friend of mine was just in a really bad car accident. He's in Virginia. Why's he there? He goes to Washington and Lee. Wealthy goyim? His dad works for Lawrence and Lebbe. Big law firm. Very connected. Is he gonna be all right? I don't know. She said they're worried about him being paralyzed. How terrible! By the way, what's the name "Dubbie"? I never heard such a name. Thank you for coming. I didn't wanna do this alone. You know, we can take turns driving, in case you get tired. People, may I have your attention, please? I need to see the following students: Ackerman, Blume... D. Cohen, R. Cohen... So where are you going to school? Spelman. A Negro school? Why are you going there? I mean, you can go anywhere now. Just because we can doesn't mean we have to. And my mother went there, her mother went there. It's tradition. No such thing for Sylvan and I. We're the first ones to go to college. Why? My family couldn't afford it. My dad went to work when he was 14. Take a mulligan. Heavy rumors about Little Melvin. And? He's having trouble running the numbers. How so? Can't get organized. He's running it into the ground. So golf's not your game. I ran into him over at Globus. I was having lunch. Comes over to my table. I don't think it was a coincidence. Better. He can't work with white numbers runners... and white shop owners can't work with black runners. - Think we can cut a deal? - I think he has no choice. That was my plan all along. - So you and Trey fight a lot? - All the time. - About what? - Everything. Such as? Well, he thinks I'm too possessive. I think he drinks way too much. And he thinks I'm too demanding concerning sex. Really? I mean, I love sex... but Trey seems to think I get a little out of control sometimes. Out of control. Trey Travelstead. We came down from Baltimore. Travelstead is on the second floor. Only one visitor at a time. I can go upstairs, though, right? He'd like to see you. I'm glad Dubbie was able to get ahold of you. Thanks for coming down. What's the word? It's worse than it looks. Will you walk? Sure. Maybe a little limp, but that could be romantic. You know, mysterious. I need whatever I can to add to the mystique. Dubbie looked a little disturbed. You know, if you still got a thing for her, this could be your chance. It isn't gonna work out with the two of us. We'll talk about this later. It's over. It's over, it's over, it's over. This could be your chance, Van. But she comes with a warning. What? You gotta read the fine print: "Dangerous. Handle with care." So, gentlemen, where do we begin? Here's the shorthand. You screwed up the business. You need help. I'm thinking... thinking, mind you, of bringing you back into the business. Thirty percent of the take. Pass. Thirty percent is better than nothing. Soon, your 100% won't be worth shit. How's that for arithmetic? Forty percent. I'm insulted. - Fifty. - Eighty. Take it or leave it. Done. Couple of other things. Don't come to my office. I don't wanna see you. I want nothing to do with you. I can live with that. You won't wait for your drinks? Too much work to get done. Let's go, boys. We're back. - Music to my ears. - Yes, sirree. Scribbles... what I pay you for? I'm over here negotiating business for you and me, and you're eating pie. You sit over there and negotiate. I sit over here, out your way. You're ordering pie while I'm losing the business... and I don't see a ounce of remorse. Don't make me moody, understand? Go sit outside. Do you speak French? No. Do you? Not as well as my father's boyfriend does, but then again, he is French. That's a secret. Are your parents divorced? Absolutely not. They have an "understanding." Because of religion? Religion? No, no. Nothing like that. It's just more like a convenient arrangement. Your mom lives in Baltimore. Let's talk about something more pleasant. What about Trey? That was pleasant... but all good things must come to an end, fortunately or unfortunately. Seems like a nice guy, though. That's only half of it. Are you tired? You know, I can drive. We could stop at a motel. Sure. We could do that. Sure. You're sure about this? How much do you want me? I haven't been able to get you off my mind since the moment I met you. How exciting. I feel like I've died and gone to heaven. A toast. It seems to be all gone. Fear not. I have backup. I have it around here somewhere. We can do without that now. I'm just so damn happy, we've gotta have a drink. You all right? It really wasn't that funny. - You all right? - I'm fine. Wait a minute. Hey, what's the matter? What's wrong? I'm fine. What's wrong? Make love to me. - What? - Make love to me. Listen, calm down, okay? Make love to me. What's wrong, Dubbie? What's wrong? I don't need this crap. Screw you. What are you talking about? I'm fine. Everything is fine. I don't know what's going on here. I don't need this crap. I don't understand. You don't understand? I don't understand what just happened. I have everything. Every thing! And it's just wonderful! I'm happy! I have everything! How can you not understand? How do you like me so far? Lewd and lascivious behavior? What part of Annie's act was lewd and lascivious? No bare tit, no bush. Don't get it. It isn't about Annie. It's about Little Melvin. What? You run numbers, they turn their backs. Burlesque is an institution on the block. Fine. But not so fine your partnership with a dealing schvartzer. I've nothing to do with drugs. You've got a partner that deals. What the hell is wrong with you? - I'm supposed to kill him? - Too late for that. - What does that mean? - I can get you off this charge. Nothing to it. But not the FBI. What? They're gonna charge you with a violation of the Mann Act. What? What kind of a crazy charge is that? What is the Mann Act? Transportation across state lines for illegal sexual activity. Prostitution. Where'd they come up with that? How many girls do you bring into the state for shows? Who can count? Any one of those girls involved in prostitution? Who in the hell knows? They could be. I don't know what they do. They get one of them to testify, one, and it's goodbye. Do they? They've obviously got someone. Over the years, in my business, you watch enough shows, you learn. A good performer knows when to get off the stage. What are you thinking? I don't know. I don't know yet. All right, boys, stand together. You look like a hood. Stand up. Stand together. Come on, pull yourselves together. Like you know each other. - We are so proud of you. - Thank you, Dad. What do you say we get something to eat? You wanna go out to eat? It's your day. You pick it. Don't make me do that. Why don't we take a drive in the country? First place we get to, we'll stop. That's where we'll eat. Sure. Whatever. You guys work it out. I'll be right back. - Sylvia, what are you- - I'll be right back. - Wait. Where are you going? - I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Spelman. University of Maryland. We'll keep in touch. What would happen if I gave you a kiss? I think our parents would die. Probably. Definitely. Take care of yourself. You too, Ben. Nate, talk to him. What was that? I was saying goodbye to my friend. With a kiss? You talk to him now. Did you see what he just did? I don't wanna cause a scene. I'm not causing a scene. Your son just caused a scene. I'm not taking pictures. Let's go. Come on, let's go. I'm in trouble now? I'm not gonna take another picture! It's 78 degrees in downtown Baltimore. You're listening to WCBM, 680 on your radio dial. This is the Jewish hour. It's good to get a little sun on the last day before college starts. Not bad. I hate to give up the cane. A little sympathy works wonders with the girls. You want some coffee? I talked with Dubbie. She's transferred to Bennington. She all right? You know, she told me about the motel. She did? Oh, come on. She loves drama. That's how it is with thoroughbreds. Too high-strung. Tend to get spooked easily. Hope it doesn't turn you off to the breed. That was a crazy night. I bet. Find anything out from your dad? Here's the story on that. I got an uncle. He works at Justice. They're gonna prosecute your father on the Mann Act and income tax evasion. That's what he expected. It's a hell of a thing. Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
