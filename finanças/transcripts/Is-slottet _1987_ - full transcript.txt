Ice Palace loosely based on a romance by Tarjei Vesaas Hello, Siss. Come in to the warmth. Sit down, Siss. Do you have any brothers or sisters? No. That's all right. Aren't you going to ask about her? That's my mother. I knew she died this spring. She was ill all the time ...and she wasn't married either. Do you know about my father? Neither do I. Except the bit my mother told me. He had a car. She might come in. I want to be alone with you. Come over here. Let's undress. Let's undress? Yes. Take our clothes off. It will be fun. Why don't you play with all of us? I told you never to ask me that, didn't I? Let's get dressed. Aren't we going to play? No, it's too cold. Not as cold as all that. Siss? Yes? There's something I wanted... Yes? ...something I've never told anyone. Would you have told your mother? No. Do you want to tell me? Siss... I don't know if I'll go to heaven. Did you hear me? Yes. I have to go home now. You won't tell anyone? About what? About this. No. Promise? Yes. I promise. Thanks... Something wrong? I was running. Scared of the dark? No... A bit... More than a bit, I'd say. Running for dear life. You've got to say a lot tonight. It's time you went upstairs to wash. Won't you play? Why not? I can't. Is there something wrong with you? It's not that but... don't ask me about that. Now you look better. How was it at Unn's? Good night. Good night. "Siss, I must see you. Unn." Unn... Time to get up, Unn. Hello! Hello! Hello! What's wrong with Unn? She seems always on her own. No, she's not! Are you friends with Unn? Yes. Then go to her house. Why have you come and not Unn? We need a word with you. You saw Unn yesterday? What do you know? It could mean life or death. I can see you know something. What's wrong with Unn? I don't know. Don't know? She didn't say... Siss, hadn't the school planned an outing to the waterfall? Yes. Could Unn have gone there? She often went off on her own. I don't know. Have you seen my father? Yes... I promise. "Search abandoned." Hi. Hi. Feeling better now? Yes. What was wrong with Unn? Raise your voices, with angels rejoice Angels and mankind sing together From mountain to valley, from stream to shore Let the glad sounds be raised forever The angels proclaim it, hear their glad tidings Hear their glad tidings, new life is at hand Darkness is over, Life is victorius Life is victorious, a saviour is born. The angels proclaim it, hear their glad tidings Hear their glad tidings, new life is at hand. Is this desk taken? Yes, we have a new girl. Take that desk, Kari. Siss... There's a desk in the next room! Use her desk and she won't come back! Siss... Won't you come skiing with us after school? If it's to the waterfall. I'd like to be left alone. Siss... It's good of you to come. You kept to yourself all winter, I hear. I'd promised. I thought it was something like that. Come in for a moment. I've sold the house. Why was Unn like that? Wasn't Unn as she should be? Yes. You must never let promises hurt you! I promised Unn I'd not tell but... they kept asking. Yes. Well, finally a stop was put to that. Stop? Yes, the doctor didn't take too kindly to it. You were sick. It won't hurt you to know, now it's all over. Is it over? Yes, Unn is gone. She's not alive anymore. Are you quite sure? One can't be quite sure. But I knew all the same. Come here, Siss. You're freed from your promise. I was all Unn had left in the world, so I know I can do it.
