Please hold the line... Hello, Viju Prasad here. I run a vocational training institute... ...for a bunch of poor kids. To motivate our kids, can you conduct a workshop? Good decision sir. What are your fee? I do five classes, two hours per day. In India I charge Rs.1,05,000 inclusive of taxes... ...and outside India Rs.2,50,000 inclusive of taxes. Your rates are a bit too much. It's very expensive. You tell me your rate sir. Rs.3,000. Sir... 3,000 is very less, this kit cost's 5,000. - Sorry for wasting your time. - Sir, don't go. Sit down. Don't go, sit for a minute. I respect army officers like you... You have protected our nation. Hence I can't say no to you. Consider this as my service. - Money is not an issue. - Thank you Viju. Thank you so much. Sir! Sir! SIR! Though it is a service, there are some expenses. 3000 Rupees is okay, but can you throw in something along with it? 3,000 plus... Tea & snacks. Okay. Wish you could do a bit for the fuel expenses as well. Brother, couldn't pay electicity bill. Kunja... - Brother... - When did the power go? It didn't go. A guy from the electricity office came and removed the fuse. - When? - Around 5:30â€¦6. I'd texted you. - You didnâ€™t say anything about the fuse. - I didn't? Sorry. I felt that you'd forget, I gave you the money right? I'll pay it myself. It's that there's a new restaurant nearby. You get fifteen varieties of biriyani. - Which one? - New Biriyani Paradise. So I went there for lunch and... Had biriyani? No, chicken noodles & soup. - What about the balance amount? - Balance... ...on the way back from Ganesh juice stall I had two sweet-lemon juice. - Two juices? - I had two friends with me. Here's the balance. I bought your favourite Mysore-pak sweet. Shall I get it? Hmm. - What happened brother? - Why aren't you asleep? Thought I'd get some air outside, but too many mosquitoes. Can't sleep. - Sorry brother. - For what? Before I spent the money I should've thought about you. I'm so bored of eating what I cook. Next time you go, call me too. Let's go to bed. (Vessels clatter) Good morning. Good morning. - When did you wake up? - I didn't sleep. Kept thinking about what I should make you for breakfast. This will be ready in a bit, go take a bath and come. Your clothes & shoes are on the table, ironed. Shoes? Shoes are polished and kept there. Hey donâ€™t goâ€¦ Taste this. Does anything come to mind? Doesn't it taste like the tomato curry mom used to make... ...and stuff into bread for school lunch? - Didn't you like it? - No, it's okay. Just okay? I meant that it's good. You didn't like it. I've noticed... ...that whenever I speak about mom, you don't utter a word. Why are you so angry with her? How can I be angry with those who are dead, Kunja? You never speak openly, you're very secretive. Don't cook it any further. The knife's handle is loose. I cut myself the other day. I should get these changed. Let goâ€¦ your hand may get cut. Let go. I said I don't want to leave. I don't want to go, let me go! Come with me... Come... You mentioned the tomato curry sandwich and I am hungry now. I'll take a shower and come, five minutes. You sit here. The knivesâ€¦ why are you taking them? To shave. Viju... Inhale confidence. Exhale... You will be confident... You will feel confident... ...and you are confident. Good. Eat Kunja, donâ€™t you have to take your medicines? What's your problem? Tell me... We can talk about it. Look at... No, look at us... How many problems have I had to face to get us till here. Only if you have some goals can you progress in life. We have to fight some bad days to get the best days of life. Other than this rented house and congested room... ...we have a lot left to experience in life. Don't you have a dream? I do. Thousands of people packed into an auditorium, waiting to hear my speech. In five to six years, Viju's Success Juice... ... will become a million dollar company. Isn't that why I'm working hard now? First you should stop lazing around here and step out. See, start the day by thinking that it's going to be a good one. For Godâ€™s sake can't you leave me alone? Why are you irritating me? Why do you want to start a fight with me? Okay, I won't say a word. It's not good to be lose sleep, have your medicine. - Take the Medicine... - TAKE IT AWAY! MEDICINES THAT WILL KILL ME! LOST ALL MY HEALTH EATING THIS! Why the hell do... If I ask him to come to the hospital, he wonâ€™t come doctor. Viju, I don't think it's a good idea to delay it any further. During depression, he will have mood swings. If possible,bring him here soon. Go see what the situation is at home and call me immediately. If necessary, I will send the hospital staff. I'll try myself once doctor. It's better if he agrees to come, right? I don't want it to be like the last time. It's not easy to witness it. Kunja... Brother, It's when I was sleepless last night... ... that I had this brilliant idea. My plan is to go on a long journey... ...only God knows where to. If there is a god. I know you have suffered because of me. For madman like me, you are wasting the good days of your lifeâ€¦ ...It's not fair. I still remember that day while returning home from school. Kunja... Kunja... Kunja... Is this for me? Yes. For me! (Giggles) So many nights that you've spent sleepless, keeping me company. I've always loved you. Come, come. Brother, do you know? Successful people walk five times faster than average people. Come, come, walk faster. The power of "I AM" These two words are... ...what determines where you... ...and your life-path goes. I am happy. I am strong. I am... Get lost! I don't want to go, don't let me go. I said I don't want to go. Lost all my health eating this! Medicines that will kill me! You never speak openly, you're very secretive. Why do you want to start a fight with me? I don't want to go! This is not the end Viju. This is not the end. I am unable sleep at all doctor. Always hearing voices in my head. I tried everything doctor, No doctor not able to, no sleep. Please do something doctor. This is not the end. Truth Love Everything Divine Purity Path Liberation Heaven Love Truth Divine Purity Path Liberation Heaven He shall not gasp in fright He wins over fright Unto me is he born Unto me is he born Emptiness... leave! Blindness... leave! Darkness... leave! Emptiness... leave! Blindness... leave! Darkness... leave! - Uncle, please give it to me. - Yes child. Give me this one & that one. Madam! Did you recognise me? We had met in Kanyakumari, Viju... Oh... yes Viju. Breathe in, breathe out. - Are you here now? - I work for a courier service. But you had a kick-ass job Viju, did you leave that? Maâ€™am, can you please help me out? It's been two-three months since I am here. Through your contacts if I could get a job.... Actually I'm a casting agent you know? For films & advertisements. Great! I guide actors to create a better impression of themselves... ...so that they can achieve their goals. Madam, I'm a certified motivational trainer. Do you know who I was fighting with? I was fighting with my fear. Oh my god! You again? Listen to the music that will galvanize... ...energize, vitalize & dynamize you. Viju's Success Juice, Kanyakumari. Yeah, he seems like the one. - Good morning Viju - Morning madam. Have you heard of the Tripac group? Tripac? No madam. They're a huge corporate entity with their head office in Cochin. They are looking for a corporate trainer to motivate their employees. They're very happy after seeing your videos. Thank you Madam. I have fixed a meeting for you at 10 o'clock. Traffic is quite heavy, can you reach Colaba by ten? I'll reach there exactly at ten madam. Viju? (Viju moans) -What happened? - Nothing. Just had a fall, with the excitement. I'm Solomon Davis, and this is my partner Isaac Thomas. I'm Viju. Coffeeâ€¦ Serve him some coffee. - Please... - No, thank you. When someone... ...offers something with love, you should learn to accept it thankfully. Otherwise it just seems a little rude. You know what I'm saying? - Biju, right? - It's Viju sir, Viju Prasad. - Sorry Sir. - No, don't apologise. Please drink your coffee. This is a very informal meeting. Just for the three of us to get to know each other. - Yes yes - In every relationship... - stability is the most important. - Of course sir. Only with stable and committed relationshipsâ€¦ ...can employee productivity be increased. I can assure you one thing... After this programme... ...all Tripac employees will be 100% productive at their job... ...and a 100% successful. Vijuâ€¦are you 100% successful? In this country what would a professionally qualified youngster... â€¦get as a monthly salary? Do you have any idea Viju? - Around forty to fifty thousand - Viju, how much do you expect? - Eh...well... - One lakh? - That's okay Sir. - How about ten lakhs? What? How about twenty-five? One crore? How much ever it is, money, will never be... ...able to satisfy, Viju. More is never enough. At that desk, do you see the person speaking to the guests? His name is Selvakumar. He's the manager here. Nice guy, well educated. For thirty-seven years he has been at this restaurant doing his job dutifully. But he didn't reach anywhere. There was another person... ....who was a waiter in this restaurant thirty-seven years back. - He's studied only till eighth grade. - Doesn't know a word in English. Don't look. He's not here, he's in Paris. Abraham Davis. My father. Then waiter, now owner of this hotel. - Oh - What's the secret Viju? He was driven by want. - You...get that? - Yes yes. You need to learn to be driven by want Viju. We didn't select you for a motivational training programme. But, for something greater. We are all emotional beings Viju. We're always looking for a connection. And that's why we have decided to start a new venture. To feed people's emotions with a powerful drug. Drug? Not the kind of drugs you are thinking of. A far more powerful drug. Religion. Religion is the powerful drug that I'm talking about. - Do you believe in god? - No But the majority of the world population believe in God. That faith, wherever it comes from, is always welcomed with open arms. That hope is our business, and you... ...will be the face of our business. - I don't really get it Sir. - Basically it is the same thing a... ...motivational speaker does. But we are injecting a small element into it... 'God' Is it to make me a spiritual leader or something? Not a spiritual leader. But a... ...miracle worker. To play the messenger of god... ...a pastor. - Pastor? - Yeah. You only need to touch and... ...the blind will see, the cripple will walk, and the deaf will hear. Obviously it will all be staged. - Won't that be a problem - Who would make a problem? There are many in the Government to protect our interest, you have nothing to worry about. You're in safe hands. I need some time to think Sir. Viju... Your journey from Kanyakumari to Mumbai, we know it all. A family with a suicidal history... Your Mother, Kunjan... ...no one is alive. I really thought you had it in you. You have two choices. First... â€¦you can forget that this meeting ever happened and go back. Second choice has only one condition... ...there's no going back. Let's call the next candidate. I don't want to go back Sir. Good. Two weeks from now, a rigorous crash course on bible & theology will begin. After the course, only if we are convinced... ...you will be in. Meet Avarachan. Your guide & mentor. Bible, theology, Pastorâ€™s body language, mannerisms... ... Avarachan will teach you everything. So, pack your bags and get ready. You're flying to Kochi. The Bible, which has been written within a span of 1500 years... ...has sixty-six books. Writings by forty people are now sixty-six books. Among them are warriors, fishermen, shepherds, farmers... ...philosophers, physicians and kings. But, what we must focus on... ...are the miraculous stories of Jesus. Specifically the ones which talks about curing illness and prosperity. Coming to the New Testament. Mathews, Marcos, Lucose... - Are you bored? - That's okay sir. It will be boring, but you absolutely have to learn it. Yes sir. Before continuing with our class, stand up, close your eyes and pray to god. I'm not a believer Sir. Whether you believe or not, you will pray. - It's that Sir... - Silence! -Sorry... -When I say silence... ...don't you dare utter a word. You should find out who I was before starting this job! I'm not your guide, mentor or anything they said I was. I'm Jesus, your god... ...and you, my slave. They will select you only if I say yes. Jeremiah Chapter 29, Verse 11. - The Lord exclaims... - Exclaims? Nonsense. The Lord proclaims....! Correct, correct. Sorry. "The Lord proclaims... ...he has plans for you that"... (fumbles) Stop it! "For I know the plans I have for you,â€ â€œThey are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope." - Were you really a motivational trainer? - Yes. I have membership at the Indian Society of Training and Development. You have great potential to be...an idiot. Sir, Sir... Can you do me a favour? In the mighty name of Jesus... I come against every spirit of sickness and... ...command it to depart in the name of JESUS! There is power, wonder working power... ...in the blood of Jesus Christ. Touch! Touch! Touch! This is a miracle... Touch! Blessed be the name of the LORD. HALLELUJAH! When you wear expensive clothes... ...rich perfumes and kneel in prayer. There is a stench within you. - It's the stench of sin. - Yes, the stench of sin. Jesus will remove the stain of sin from your heart. Jesus will remove the stain of sin from your heart. When Jesus comes near you, he will free you from your sins. He will set you free from sin. Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation. Be consistent in your prayers. Raise your hands and pray to Jesus. Praise Jesus... Glory! Glory! Glory! Sometimes he acts a bit crazy, and can be a bit impulsiveâ€¦ But everything else is okay... ...Perfect! Yes...hey. I'll give it to him. It's Solomon Sir. Hello sir. From today, you are no longer Viju Prasad. You are officially ordained as Pastor Joshua Carlton. Better start getting used to it, okay? Congratulations, Pastor Joshua Carlton. Thank you sir. How's the new name? At first these lowly local names came upâ€¦ ...like Viju, Biju, Shiju, Shyju etc. Joshua was my suggestion... Joshua Carlton. J C Jesus Christ. Oh illusory beingâ€¦ the Holy lightâ€™s flameâ€¦ thee shall praise Him The Lord, His hands That heal, thee shall beg Him He who is your protector Camera One, zoom in. He who is your world Joy... - How many lambs have come? - 2000 have registered. Around 1500 have already entered the auditorium. 1500? That's not enough. Oh illusory beingâ€¦ the Holy lightâ€™s flameâ€¦ thee shall praise Him The Lord, His hands That heal, thee shall beg Him Pastor Joshua... You are on in a minute. An auditorium packed with thousands, waiting to hear my speech. Isn't that why I'm working so hard now? Hallelujah! Praise the Lord, God Almighty! And praise his mighty name! Dear brothers & sisters... ...this is glorious. Today... ...is the day the Lord has prepared for us. A day he arranged for us to be happy and rejoice. Let us all be happy & rejoice. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! - Good morning, Sir - After spending lakhs on this programme... â€¦ is it only 1500 people there? If the target we intend is not metâ€¦ Avaracha... - Understood Sir. - How's his performance? - Not bad Sir. - After six months of trainingâ€¦ it is â€œnot badâ€ - Youâ€¦ call me after the programme. - Yes Sir. Jesus. I know, I can feel it in my spirit. I want to tell you all a story... ...that of a donkey... A donkey? Yes, a farmer's donkey. Once the farmerâ€™s donkey slipped and fell into a well. Seeing the donkey struggling in the deep well, the farmer was in despair Not knowing what to do, he asked his neighbours for help. Many of them gave many suggestions. All the while, the poor donkey was crying in great pain from the well. Finally everyone decided to seal the well with mud ... ...and stones and free the donkey from its pain forever. The poor donkey hopelessly looked at his owner... Tom, slowly cue music... Let the donkeys hear. When the mud, stones and dirt fell on him... ...the donkey shook it off his body and stepped aside. The men continued to throw, but the donkey kept ignoring it all... ...and continued to shake it all off his body and step up over the mud & stones. shake it off, step over it... shake it off, step over it. Using the the mud, stones and dirt that had been thrown on him... ...the donkey, step by step, arose and stepping over everything he got out of the well! HE ESCAPED! Pump the music! Pump it! All the problems & hurdles in our life... ...should be faced with hope. We have to find ways to make our difficulties into stepping stones! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! He is rocking it here Sir! Extraordinary! Our Jesus is a miracle working god. How many of you believe that a miracle will happen tonight? If you believe in Jesus, you will have to believe in miracles as well. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! (Chanting continues) Those who need a cure for illness, raise you hands. Many, many types of diseases, but some of them are not really illnessesâ€¦ ...they are possession. Possession by demonic forces! That too shall depart now! Call out to Jesus! Jesus! Jesus! Do not utter that name with fear, When you say it with faithâ€¦ ...SATAN WILL BE SHOCKED! THE ILLNESS WILL BE SHAKEN! . JESUS! (Gibberish) Place your hand on the area that the illness manifests. Your body is the temple that the Lord resides in. There is no place for a disease there. So Diabetes - you don't have no right on my body! (High) Blood pressure, you have no right over me! No right! Cholesterol counts - you have no right over me! Now, miracles will happen hereâ€¦ I believe in miracles! Hallelujah! Pastor, the patients are ready. The Holy Spirit has revealed to me... â€¦that on the right side of this gathering, sits a sisterâ€¦ She is seated as she is unable to stand. The many months of her prayers, will bear fruit today. Below her knee on the right leg, There is a growth since many monthsâ€¦ ...is there a sister like that here? Her name is... Latha... Yes, thank you Jesus. Latha! Someone give her a microphone. Sister, how did you get here? My sister Suma suggested that I come here... Is Suma here? What is your problem sister? It's cancer Pastor... - They said she needs surgery - Who said? - Doctorsâ€¦ - Doctorsâ€¦ arenâ€™t they mere men? Jesus is greater than Doctors!

As a result of Pastor Joshua's prayers, we have now been blessed with two children. Once people have fallen for the curing of illnesses. The next step is to introduce a simple investment plan, like a money back policy. Give and you shall receive. Have a blast! Have a blast in your soul. Who all here needs financial blessings?

Since there are important meetings today including the one with the Minister... Debbie... I will not be attending the ministers function today. But the Minister called again just now. For me, more important than the Minister's function is the counselling for the believers Change the programme. - What is it mother? - They threw me out of the house. This mother is from Ettumanoor. Her kids threw her out. She came early morning to see you. - What happened here? - They hit me. - Arrange for her admission to Grace Home. - Sure Pastor. Jesus is with those who have no-one.

Mathews brother? The Pastor is here... - Praise the Lord Pastor - Praise the Lord. Paul... - How is mother? - Mother is much better Pastor. - She has started cooking now. - Glory to God! Come Pastor... - Pastor, I'm Mathews. - Mathews, am I late? Not at all, I'm the one who is late. It's an honour that you agreed to come. - Sir, you can sit here. - Thank you. Mathew stand by... We're on in... ...four three two one cue. Welcome again to "One to One" The main man of Glorious church &... Glorious international ministriesâ€¦ ...Pastor Joshua Carlton is our guest today on One to One. Greetings Pastor. I am sitting in front of possibly India's youngest and... ...most successful... ...miracle worker and evangelist. Where did this journey begin? Without going back about ten-fifteen years, I wouldnâ€™t be able to... â€¦recount how my spiritual journey began Mathews. I was around eighteen-years-old then. At that age I lost my father. Fatherâ€™s death really orphaned our family. I had only my mother and little sister with me then. The debts that my father created became my mothers responsibility. One day, when I went out looking for work... ...my mother & sister... Consumed rice withâ€¦ It was a suicide. Sorry Pastor. Father's death, mother's death... ...such unfortunate events back to back. How did that eighteen-year-old hold on through it Pastor? He couldn't Mathews, I was... ...depressed. I started asking who I should live for. I didn't have anyone, I was lonely. On one such night... ...I made a decisionâ€¦ ...to end my life. Ours was a small house close to the railway track. It was about... ...two or three at night. I went to the track and laid my head on it. I cried myself to sleep. After a while... I felt someoneâ€™s touch waking me up. I opened my eyes. It was overwhelming Mathews... ...that lightâ€¦ Mathewsâ€¦ ...and then came the moment. From within the light, came a voice. â€œJoshuaâ€ â€œJoshuaâ€ Whose was it? It was Jesus! All praises to him. He then went onto say... "The life I gave you..." In Malayalam? There isnâ€™t a language that God doesnâ€™t know Mathews. - Then? - Then he said... â€œI have given you this life, you have no right to end itâ€¦ ...your life is mine. You are not an ordinary person. You are the chosen one." You, the light; just the thought of it... ...gives me goosebumps. You heard Jesus's voice. Did you see his form? I did, Mathews. I saw him. I'm asking out of a common man's curiosity, Please don't mind. When you say you saw Jesus... ...did you see the figure that we common folk are familiar with? From books and paintingsâ€¦ The handsome man with long hair and a beard. Did you see the same figure? I'm not common folk, Mathews. Hence, I didnâ€™t witnessed what a common man would have imagined that night... It's like love. God is love, Mathews. Love does not have a physical form. Okay... Within a short span of time... ...you have grown exponentially, Pastor Joshua Carlton. Let's see some images. Within a short span of time, Pastor Joshua Carlton... ...has become a rage within the hearts of believers worldwide. He is the philosopher & guide for millions of people today. Not just in spirituality. Combining medical, educational & social services... ...Glorious church has three-hundred establishments... ...in over a hundred-and-ten countries. Including the French Legion of Honour and... the U.N award for social work, Pastor Joshua Carlton has received... ...several national and international recognitions and continues his spirited journey. Awards, recognitions, educational institutions... ...and centres around the world in the name of Glorious church. You might be easily Kerala's richest spiritual leader. Right? Yes. But then and now, Jesus is my only earning. Let's see a few more images. Rolls-Royce, BMW, Porsche, Benz, and a private jet. A luxury apartment in the heart of Kochi worth ten crores. In Bangalore & Munnar you have estates, resorts and villas. Investments in international corporate companies. For a spiritual leader and a self proclaimed servant of god like you... â€¦is it a bit too opulent? - All these are... - The answer to this question, after the break. This is Mathews, live with Pastor Joshua Carlton. - Mathews, is this recording live? - Yes. Why didn't you inform us that this was live? Sorry, is it a problem if it is live? You should've run the questions past us. - Who is this? - Is my identity the problem here? No it's not, if Pastor doesn't have a problem, why do you? - You... - Avaracha! Mathews, this is my first interview for a secular channel. I came only because you said you were a big fan and Paul here insisted... Don't worry Pastor, I didn't ask anything controversial right? - What about the last question then? - What is with this guy! Those are just to clear the doubts in peopleâ€™s minds, right? Pastor, shall we go. Where is the washroom? I'm not getting through to Solomon Sir, Lord! - Why do you need to call him now? - What else then? I need to convey that I am not responsible for this. How many times did I tell you not to do this show without asking them?! Why did I ever agree to this? Why do I need your permission? Exactly, exactly. You please tell them the same directly. I should punch my own face. Welcome back to One to One. Pastor... Repeating the question. BMW, Porsche, Benz, a private jet... - Two private jets. - Sorry Pastor... Mathews, instead of counting the number of vehicles I own... ...why don't you quantify the charitable works that I do? We are educating sixty-thousand kids. We have built homes for three-thousand poor people. We feed around two thousand people at our church everyday. You and channels like yours turn a blind eye towards all these. Have you helped anyone Mathews? Have you bought food for someone else? "What the right hand does, the left hand shouldn't know" (Old saying) That is what my mother taught me. Mathews, you have learned a few sayings. Talking about spiritual sayings, there is an allegation against you... ...regarding your spiritual saying. People like Pastor Joshua, for their selfish needs... ...are changing the meaning of spiritual sayings. His donation seeking policy and its related saying is the best example. Give him five-hundred rupees and God will give you a thousand apparently. Is this gambling? Earlier one used to go to the hospital when one got sick. Now they run to the Pastor. Miracles it seems! Starting from piles and psoriasis to now tumour, cancer... ...and other deadly diseases. How do you miraculously cure them, Pastor? I do not cure the illness, God does. So you shouldn't be asking me this question. - I can't invite God for an interview - Do you believe in God? At my show, shouldn't I be asking the questions here? So you're not a believer, that is the difference between us. No matter what I say you have come with the prejudice that I cannot be believed... I don't think I can convince you. I donâ€™t think I need to convince you. No no, you can definitely convince me. How? You should create a miracle here, I'll be convinced then. Miracles are not created... ...they happen. That's enough, only that a miracle should happen here. Pastor is creating history here. As an answer to non-believers and his critics... Pastor Joshua's live miracle. For the first time on One to One show. Mathews, I'm warning you... - What about? - It's not me... ...but the Creator himself, that you've questioned. Okay Dear Lord in heaven... Let your greatness be showcased here. You're a very sharp TV journalist, Mathews. I am. You're an energetic... ..and brave young man. Thank you Pastor. At first sight, you appear completely healthy Yes. This healthy body is God's blessing. Are you sweating, Mathews? Feeling dizzy? Feeling dizzy? Do you have trouble standing up? Pastor... Break. Jesus... Oh Jesus, please forgive him Lord. Oh Jesus, please forgive this child. Lucose chapter 4, verse 12 Do not test your god Jesus. Understood? Onto further newsâ€¦ During an interview with Glorious Church's Pastor Joshua Carlton, Metro-News anchor Mathew Varghese collapsed. This happened during live telecast of the interview show One-To-One. It was while questioning the Pastor's miracle work, that the anchor fell unconscious. Pastor! Oh Mathew, how could this happen upon you? Move, move. Oh Mathew, how could this happen upon you? As they say Experience is the best teacher, as provern by the unwilling student Mathew. Anyway Mathew came to his senses when he lost consciousness! Oh Mathew, how could this happen upon you? We operate in the shadows... Our operations & investments are not meant to be discussed... ...on a television channel! What the heck was he thinking? Well you decide everything, is it? In a secular channel, we would get more publicity... Not we... You! The miracle was fake... The miracle that Joshua Carlton performed during the interview was fake. Anchor Mathew fell unconscious due toâ€¦ ...a drug in his system that restricts blood flow. For more details, Shani joins us from Medical Trust Hospital. Sharafu, Mathew Varghese's blood test report is out... ...it says that he had traces of a chemical called Furosemide in his system. During the break-time Mathew was served a juice that mightâ€¦ â€¦have been laced with the chemical, is what the police infer. In relation to this, a worker at the channel's canteen called Paul... ...is being searched for by the Police. Paul who has been missing since yesterday, has not been tracked down by the Police. The Police have strengthened the investigation Following this, Glorious church's activities should be investigated thoroughlyâ€¦ . â€¦is what the Action Council proposed. There are only two kinds of people on earth. There are masters & there are slaves. You donâ€™t have any confusion about which one you are, right? Take off everything & get out as you came. Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect... ...and fear. I don't fear anybody. What a killer blow man. You hit him at a sensitive spot in the temporal lobe. Let twenty-four hours go by... ...only then can we evaluate. Catherine, there's been a small change. Our programme on the fifteenth will have to be postponed by two weeks. The Pastor has gone to London. No no... Ok ok ok. Twenty-fourth hour. Forty-eighth hour. Situation looks grim... Nah, he's not responding to any medication. I think... ...he's almost finished. You have two choices... One, go back now and forget that this meeting ever happened. There's only one condition in the next choice... ...there's no going back. I don't want to go back sir. Good. The news of his death should not go public, that's your responsibility. There are a few media people lurking outside. I'm worried if they will smell the news. When Pastor was in meditation, God took him as he is to heaven. That is how the news should come out. Pastor Joshua from here on will be knows as... Saint Joshua. To take the body, our boys will arrive in an ambulance tomorrow morning. The third day. Reach the dead end of the corridor and take a right. Anybody here? chengis, just wait there. There's a problem. Come only when I tell you to. - Yes Debbie. - Sir, please come down to the I.C.U What happened? - Pastor's awake. - WHAT? - Please come fast. - Oh ok. - There seems to be a problem - What problem? He's...He's sounding abnormal. What? It's... I think it's problematic Sir. Pastor... Where are they? - Who? - The ones from the devil. The ones who sin... ...the progeny of poisonous vipers. Do you mean Solomon sir & Isaac sir? Yes, them. Take me to them. (Gibberish) Welcome... I am back! Enjoying the party, eh? For all our upcoming parties... ...I was planning something special! I meant Glorious shows & my programmes. That's very proactive. I'm always one step ahead Solu. That's why I put you all in the guest list, let's rock the party! But there are three rules. One, obey only what I say. Two, obey only what I say! - Three... - Obey what you say Pastor. Let's get things started. - Avarach! - Yes? Read out the chart with our list of mega shows. The first... The first one is on December 25th Mega miracle Fest YES! YES! (Gibberish) To grant five hundred thousand believers. health & prosperity... Answering my call... The Holy God, for the first time appears & blesses believers... ...with good health and prosperity. Fifty Crores. Fifty Crores comes into our pockets with... THE MEGA MIRACLE FEST! From now onwards there's a small change in the percentage share between us. Twenty percent for you and eighty percent for me. Come again? Eighty percent. Nothing less, nothing more, nothing else. Because I don't live in your reality. I'm from the heavens & it's going to cost you. Just one punch is enough to shake your reality. Yes! Yes! Yes! - You! - What is it? (Pastor screaming) Dude, he's gone completely cuckoo. With the blow to the head & the side effects of the drugs we have been... ...giving him over the years, his brain is a mess. The half-mad is completely mad now. Madness? Him? He's the type to drive us mad Jayce. Exactly, how else can madness be cured in a day? He chased me all of last night , but this morning, he is completely normal. That's what he is... God today, the devil tomorrow. Day after, he might say that he is the Indian President. Oh! You mean split personality. What if all this is him acting? If he indeed is acting... ...he deserves an award. Hey Kavita! Looking for a girl who fits a certain profile... I want you to consider this a high priority. Sure sir. Early twenties, naive, starry eyed... graceful... talented... And a smile that lights up the freaking room, yeah. There is one sir. Esther Lopez. She is more intoxicating than the night She currently resides in Mumbai, in Bandra. She's been on the scene for a maximum of eleven months. What's the story? It's the usual boyfriend scene. He cheated her, her family... ...kicked her out of the house. Then there was alcohol, drugs & depression. I've heard that she even has a child. Okay. Sir, this girl is just superb. But... - She's a high maintenance chick. - Sounds good to me, bring her in. In those long eyes is there a blue whirlpool? On moist lips is there a wave of silence? Are you that ocean... ...into which anyone can sink? Suffused with heat... ...are the sky and all the suns melting and diffusing in your redness? - Hello! - Hi sir. Your job is actually very simple. You just need to get really close to him. Is he really mad? Or is it all an act? That's what we want to know. Simple? Everything else, Avarachan will take care. He'll be in touch with you. Hello Esther? - Avaracha... - Yes? Anyway to get some alcohol? Today is the 1st of the month. You won't get alcohol. The Pastor has woken up, he didn't quite recognize me. He asked me who I was, like in the film Anniyan. - Ask Esther to start off - Okay sir. - Good Morning Pastor. - Good Morning... I'm Esther. Debbie had a family emergency and had to leave for France. Just for a month, till then I'll be assisting you. Pastor, I assure you Debbieâ€™s absence won't be felt. I'll take care of everything. May I read the schedule Pastor? What day is it? Dry day.

Pastor... You haven't had the pills you were supposed to take in the morning. Hallelujah! Just like you predicted Pastor... ...the profits projection are looking great. Mineral extractions, overheads & the royalty to be paid to the Government. Beyond that we have still made a profit of 200 Crores. Good, good! Very good, good enough... But not... Big enough. In the next quarter, our profit... 1000 Crores. A plan to make it 1000 Crores is what we need. 1000 Crores? - You can ask me how. - How Pastor? - Brother, pull up our site photos. - Yes. Hold that, at first glance they are just rocks. But I see a paradise in between these rocks. - Ask me how, how how? - How? In between the rocks up to this level, we fill water. We fill water to this level. Then we set up around fifty boats over here. The kind of boats you can pedal. Daily, there would be a minimum of a thousand tourists. Families, children, couples, and it goes on. For fun, we can even put some fish in the water. Fish! Boating... ...with fishing. Boating with fishing, WOW! For tickets, we charge a minimum of 200 dollars for an hour. How is that? How is the idea? How is the idea? How is the idea? How is the plan? How is my plan? Out of this world. Superb! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Start the work tomorrow. Pastor... Can I? - Okay - Amazing. Cheers! - Please don't beat my child - Child...? Is this something a child will do? Get out of this place. What was your job before? One second, friend calling. Hello, tell me. How're you dude? Esther... The Pastor cannot sleep without the pills, he has a show tomorrow. He will say no... ...but you will have to convince him to take it and go to bed early.. Don't worry, it will be done. - Okay? - Okay. Pastor, from the green container in the morning you need to take one tablet. At noon, from the yellow, two tablets. And at night from the red, three tablets. Think of the traffic signal, simple. Here, take them. Excuse me. Just relax and take a chill pill. Esther, do you know who I am? Pastor! The miracle worker. I know, I know that you're a miracle worker and that... ...you don't need any medicine. But these are just vitamin tablets. What vitamins are they? Vitamin A,B,C,D,E,F...it's all there. Vitamins? - Vitamins. - Will you have it, Esther? Will you have it if I do? I will. Please have it. Goodnight Pastor. Sweet dreams. Sweet dreams. - Hello? - What happened? Were the pills taken? Yes. Slept well? Extremely well. Super, see you at church. Esther... The signs of a good night's sleep are showing on the Pastor. Very good. If you love god, do not stand silently. You should clap your hands. You should dance. The Bible says it... The Vedic scriptures say it... With dance, Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord as you dance. Even if no human likes your dance... Jesus, your creator loves it. Isn't this the Garden of Jesus? Aren't we the flowers in his garden? Filled with frenzy, let's sing and praise Jesus. Come, let's dance and sing. Let's dance and sing on the stage with Jesus. Let's jump, dance & sing praises to God. Isn't this the Garden of Jesus? Aren't we the flowers in his garden?

High voltage power, will pass through your body. And miracles will happen. Wheelchair, I see a brother on a wheelchair. Both of his legs are paralyzed, a brother who is unable to stand. Left... He's on the left side of the hall, that's what God has shown me. Not the left, right, right! That brother has come along with a friend. Is such a brother here? - Praise the Lord Pastor. - Praise the Lord. My name is Mathews. You all might know me. For questioning Pastor... ...and collapsing on the floor of the studio... I've been shred apart with trolls on social media. But... There's a day that God appears in front of everyone. I had eyes which saw the world only with distrust. - Those eyes were opened by Pastor. - Praise the Lord! Four years ago, in an accident... My friend Soji's lower body was paralyzed. Praise the Lord. He's been wishing to see the Pastor for a long time. When I came here with him, we never expected that we will be called up on stage so soon. Thank you Pastor. From being able to stand here... Do you believe you can walk back home Soji? Yes Pastor. - Do you honestly believe that? - Yes I do. Really? For sure. This brother will walk back home, how many of you believe that it will happen? I believe it. If you have faith as big as a mustard seed, you can move mountains. Praise the Lord! praise the Lord! The legs of this brother, is in the clutches of the devil. This morning, the presence of God is going to touch you brother. Dear God! I'm offering both of Soji's legs for your greatness. For the rest of his life... ...to jump & dance in your name... ...strengthen the legs of this brother, dear Jesus! Brother, try to stand now. - I'm not able to Pastor. - Not able to? Try again. I can't Pastor. But you still believe that you can stand right? Yes! (Gibberish) With him, you have come here to trouble me, is it? Honestly no, both of my legs are paralyzed. Shush! Brother... Can I get a long stick or cane? - Would the Mic-stand suffice? - Yes Hallelujah! Dear Lord! Through this stand, may your miracle reveal itself. - Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! Today morning... Today morning, God is saying a powerful sentence. To chase away a few evil souls, I have come down from heaven. Satan! No, no you will not destroy him. There's no use begging me now. (Gibberish) What? Within your body... ... all the demons that are possessing it... (Gibberish) Power! Power! I will free you from your demons. I will destroy them. Get out in the name... My legs are fine, My legs are fine. Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! Now show us how you can walk. Now run. I'll show you. Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!

It's been a month since Hanna attended school. By just praying and fasting her illness will not get cured. Take the child to a hospital Sheeba. The fever has come down? Apparently the fever is dropping. Then may we step in and see her? - Not now (by sign) - Why? Her dad? The childâ€™s father is inside. She has high fever. Let's take her to a hopsital.

After creating heaven & earth in six days, even God slept on the seventh. When Debbie was around, you used to take your medication on time. Do I... ...seem like I have some kind of problem, Esther? What problem? Goodnight Pastor... Pastor Pastor... Have your medicines. Pastor? Pastor? Pastor? Psychotropic drugs are more dangerous than we think they are. They may cause personality change and mood changes. Fyprexa, Sanax, Disperdal and other such medication on long-term usage... ...damages brain cells and leads to the patient hallucinating... ...and have anxiety & lose memory. In short, these medicines slowly kill a person. Esther? I was charting tomorrows schedule. What happened to your hand? This? It's a long story Pastor. Started with depression & reached suicide. But it all failed. Kunja! The knife's handle is loose. I cut myself the other day. I should get these changed. Let goâ€¦ your hand may get cut. Let go. Esther... Yes Pastor? God created you like an angel. You're so precious in the eyes of God. You shouldn't ruin yourself anymore. Say no to drugs... ...no alcohol. Esther... Oh moon who came leaning on the sky Oh moon who came leaning on the sky - Depression Everyone has depression these days... sadness. What were you searching for in the dark Oh this happened to me! No one loves me! No one is with me Hey idiots! See the God sitting with you! You stand before me like a broken statue. Oh trust in your Lord God, Esther! You will no longer destroy yourself, promise me that. Say no to drugs, no alcohol. Repeat after me Esther, No drugs! No alcohol! What did you quietly lock away from my vision Drifting into the atonement fire you within your eyes. From the soul, let it come from the inside. Real, real! Not like that, it should look real. Mother, with more energy from the inside. Exactly, let it come from the inside. This madness, is it imagined or real, will it transform into pain? All these are plastic. These secrets, will the reluctance to reveal fade by itself? We stand on sharp edges Watching each otherâ€™s every move We stop being ourselves Pastor... Who is Kunjan? In some thoughts that flow today It's very dusty upstairs. I need to sleep. I need to sleep. Pastor? Pastor? Pastor? Pastor... I need to tell you something, please open the door. Pastor, please. J.C here... Praises Pastor. Praises, praises. Pastor, this is Thomas... I've been trying you over the phone for a few days, you weren't available. - Which Thomas? - Thomas, Hanna's dad. Yes Thomas, tell me. Pastor, my daughters health has worsened. Her body is boiling with fever. Everyone is asking me to take her to the hospital. What should I do Pastor? There is no need for that. God will work miracles Thomas, he will. Pastor, please open the door. I need to tell you something. The punishment for your sins are being suffered by Hanna now. Thomas? Don't cry Thomas. Don't cry. You feel guilty for the sins you have committed. - Right, Thomas? - Yes, Pastor. This fever... It is merely a test on your belief in God, Thomas... Jesus, you know the pain & tears of a father... Pastor, please open the door! In this second... At brother Thomas's house... We believe a miracle has taken place. - Tell me you believe Thomas. - I do. I believe. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Sir, the Pastor has problems. He's really sick. I can see Thomas... ...that when you get back home... ...Hanna will be up, in good health jumping around. Glory to God! Hallelujah! Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord Pastor. How sure are you Esther? Very sure. The medicines that he takes has a lot of side effects. He really needs help. Thank you, I think your job is done. Let this Viju Prasad... â€¦continue his madness... ...till the end of this Miracle Fest. Hmm. Esther? Book of John, Chapter 5, Verse 25 Amen! Amen... â€œTruly, I say to you, an hour shall come, and is now here, when the... ...dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. On hearing the Voice, thy child too shall be resurrected. In the hope that we shall see her in that glorious body, let us bury the child's mortal remains. Stop! Thomas Kutty! - Pastor! - Thomas Kutty! Thomas Kutty! Thomas Kutty, please stop. Pastor! Pastor! Please touch her and pray Pastor. Let my daughter wake up... Please touch her and pray. My daughter will wake up Pastor. Please touch her and pray Pastor. My daughter is not dead. Pastor, please do something. Let her wake up. Pastor, please. Move! Pastor! Pastor!

Let us discuss. Please... -Dear Lord! Don't leave me... -Now come outside. Let's talk outside... Pastor, can I see you just once. Please? Praise the Lord Pastor. Where did Esther go? - Esther, which villa was she in? - This one. No, this one has been shut for maintenance the past few days. Is it the next one? This is the one. No Pastor, I'm quite sure that no one lives here. The number you are trying to reach... ...is temporarily out of service. Please try again later. Where is Esther? Who Pastor? Esther. Esther? Let's take a short break... Which Esther is it Pastor? Debbie's replacement, Esther. Replacement? Where did Debbie go? It's been a month since Debbie left Avaracha... Debbie! Just like you wanted Pastor, your suit colour has been changed. Try it out please. We'll decide it tomorrow. Pastor needs little rest. It's been quite a day, right Pastor? That childâ€™s corpse and her father. Really messed my head up too. Pastor, you need to relax. Take your pills & get some good sleep. I'm not mad Avaracha... I'm going to reveal it all. Solomon, Isaac & you who made all of this happen. I will expose all of you. Go ahead... Reveal it all... Solomon, Isaac... Do you even have a photo of them with you? Who they are... What they are... Their address... Do you know any of it? Their identities do not exist Pastor. There isnâ€™t even a company called Tripac group. But it's not the same for you... All the businesses that are owned by Glorious Trust... ...you alone are heading it J.C. Only you will be screwed. Millions of believers across the world are going to come day after. Finish the job, make them that money... ...and leave. Any other thoughts at this time is useless... ...Viju. Thomas... I'm Viju Prasad... ...not Pastor Joshua Carlton. I'm not a miracle worker. I do not possess any special talent or knowledge whatsoever. I'm a fake. Mathews brother... Pastor asked me to give this to you. I'm Viju Prasad... ...not Pastor Joshua Carlton. I'm not a miracle worker. I do not possess any special talent or knowledge whatsoever. I'm a fake. (People praying & chanting) He seems a bit weak Sir... In this state, I have no idea about how his performance will be. - I'll send across a pill, alright? - Okay. Give it to him twenty minutes before the programme. - Yes Mathews brother? - I have got a bomb. In between the 8 p.m news, keep aside five minutes for me. I've mailed you the material. Okay, okay brother. I'll check it right away. Okay. What is it brother? Watch the video & keep it on standby. Air it only once I confirm. (Viju screaming) You're going to get screwed Avaracha.

Even if it does, I'm not sure if you're in a state to read it. Hoping it will reach you. I lost track of the number of letters I've written to you. If this reaches you, please reply back. I'm lost. It's hard for me to sleep at night. I have started taking anti-depressants again. I'm leaving this country Pastor... I'm unable to stay in one place. Sometimes, I feel like I'm constantly running away from my past. Pastor, you have told me... ...that God does not always work miracles. He does not free us from pain. But He gives us strength to endure such painful times. In the hope that I will get to meet you at least once.
