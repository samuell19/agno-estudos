THE CASE AGAINST X Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Sir undoubtedly has an appointment with sir. Mr. Dorgères' secretary gave me an appointment here at 8.30. Announce Mr. Phalempeau. Phalempeau... That's right. Friend, I live in Saint-Cloud. I had to get up at 7am, it's no joke. Sir must excuse me, but sir has strict instructions. I have to warn him. - I suppose he's still asleep. Sir hasn't been to bed. He's worked all night in his office. He does this occasionally. Would you like a seat? A doctor, quick! Quick! It's sir! What about sir? Is he sick? - No. He's dead. Eh? What? Dead? Dorgères is dead? Yes, chief. Forensics are here, of course. The judge too. The world and his wife it seems. Ah, no. No idea yet. "Knife wound up to the hilt in the neck", according to the doctor. Oh no. No, it's not yet found. Wouldn't you rather I wait for you? Okay. I'll continue operations. Cheesed off, me? I've never been happier. Can I go now? No. Chief inspector Bonnardel will want to see you. It's routine. Again? But the commissioner has already seen me, as have you. You uncovered the crime. - Not at all. It was uncovered because of you. Is that a reproach? - We don't hold a grudge. Listen, I'm a businessman, tomorrow is the liquidation on the stock market... The liquidation of Dorgères is enough for me. I have appointments that you're making me miss. All because somebody killed Dorgères. So what? Was he a friend of yours? - Dorgères? Heck no. He hadn't a friend in the world That narrows the range of suspects... I understand everyone hated him. If all his enemies put a flag in the window, it'd be like Bastille Day. When's the chief inspector getting here? - In a few minutes. He'll see you first. It's the least he can do. What about me then? - You? My dinner won't make itself. Sir is dead. Right. So what? I still need to eat, as do the butler and chauffeur. You want me to light the stove? Heck no! I'm a good looking sensible young man who started out as a policeman. However I'm capable of leaving you with the worst memory of a cop in your whole life. Want to try me? It's always a pleasure to talk to someone wise. When I think I almost married one of them... Is Bonnardel coming? - Yes, judge. I can't hang about, I've work to do. In any event, you'll receive my letter for judicial assistance. I'll see Bonnardel this evening. Perhaps you'll have uncovered something... Thanks. It looks a straightforward case to me. Really? - At first sight, of course. Dorgères's life was a hurricane, hence the shipwreck. You think a woman did this? I think nothing. An investigator mustn't have preconceptions. It's one of the possibilities. Women give up on the bankrupt, not billionaires. Forget anything I said and be cautious. He was a bigwig, Dorgères. He might turn out to be a bit like the Duke de Guise, even greater dead than alive. Goodbye, dear commissioner. Goodbye, my friend. Tell Bonnardel to call me. He always gives me the impression of having come from a marriage mass. What do you think of his suggestion? Nothing. It's all up in the air. I'll wait for something to land. Oh, very droll. Thanks. 11.20. Blast, my wife is making some mayonnaise. I'll have to call her. - Mind out for any fingerprints. Have you discovered anything, doctor? Forensic medicine doesn't discover, it observes. The blade penetrated to the level of the medulla oblongata and followed a slightly oblique path, plunging from right to left ending up in the in the superior vena cava. I'll be able to tell you more after the autopsy. Me, you know, and medicine... - Yes, and me too. Dorgères is a big cheese. Don't let him choke you. You're not stopping for Bonnardel? - So he can cadge my cigarettes? Can we send him to the institute? Yes. I'll take care of him after lunch. I'm off to the commissariat. Hunting for truffles? - I've found something. The murder weapon? - That would astonish me. A button? So it seems. Funny sort of button though. Why funny? - It's quite unusual. Question of the weight perhaps,, or the material. This button tells us nothing. Need to know where it came from. - We'll look into it. Hello everyone. Okay? - Yes. Hello, chief. Anything new? - Nothing. The weapon hasn't been found. The doctor and the judge have gone. Have you questioned the servants? No. Phalempeau neither. - Phalempeau? He had an appointment with Dorgères. The butler received him... Don't tell me the whole story, leave me some surprises. Do you have a cigarette? I've forgotten mine. This is what the doctor said... - Oh yes? You can keep the packet. - No. Where's the fun in that? Attractive place, eh? There's enough room in here for the entire social insurance department. We must tread carefully. Dorgères was a bigwig. The press will have a field day. This had to fall in my lap. Nothing you haven't seen before, chief. This is my first billionaire, that's what worries me. It reminds me of a case. - Oh yes? Oh, from a while back. It was winter 1937. Dorgères was leaving a night club: 2 shots were fired. A jealous husband but clumsy. He missed Dorgères, who refused to press charges, hence the whole business was buried. The investigating judge had an inkling along those lines. Really? I must be mistaken then. Is the paper knife on holiday? - Excuse me? These things are always sold with a matching paper knife. You didn't know that? No. Yes... I mean, I hadn't made the connection. Do it, it'll keep you busy. Photo the top of the bureau. Okay, chief. Find out where that came from. It's almost new. Want to bet 50 packets of Gauloises that it was a gift from his chick? No. - Pity. It's the sort of boring gift women give to men. ??? Right, send for me to the small lounge the 4 zigotos over there moldering in the hall. One by one, obviously. Phalempeau first? One has to start somewhere. - Oh, sorry. - Hello. How's it going? Everything's going okay. Mr. Phalempeau, please. We're going to remove the body. Can we? I suppose. Nothing remaining? No, it's all done. We've seen enough. Sylvestre. - Yes? Try to find out where this desk set came from. Okay. It should be easy, it's high end. Have you mentioned the button to the chief ? We need to be certain it didn't belong to Dorgères. Ask the butler. Okay. You don't know much. You had an appointment with Dorgères, you arrived at the set hour, the butler opened the door for you and he found his boss dead in the office. - Is that all you can tell us? - Not even that. Pardon? As I didn't go with the butler, I can't testify to what he found nor even that he went into the office. Ah, bravo. You like precision. You're an ideal witness, dear sir. The ideal witness who saw nothing. If I'd had the misfortune to see something, I'd still be here at 8pm. You'd never been here before? Never. I always saw Dorgères at his office on Rue de Tilsitt. And this summons to his domicile didn't seem strange to you? Dorgères was a law-unto-himself who worked in fits-and-starts. When he was at it, it was for 20 hours a day. He cared as little for his own rest as that of others. A brute. A weird chap. Were you in business together? Yes, a planned cotton mill in Africa that had been dormant for some time. Do you want the details? - Oh, not in the slightest. Fine. Then I'm free to go? Be my guest. Goodbye. Tell me, regarding Dorgères' love life, nothing of note to tell me? His love life? You might as well talk of heart sickness in a milestone. No, come on... When I said "love life", it was in a manner of speaking. He had a mistress? - One a month, yes. I see. A seducer, in other words. No. A buyer. I see. You know his most recent acquisition? Vaguely. I saw her briefly at a cocktail party. She's called Catherine... Catherine something. But there may have been another one since. On that note, inspector... You'll be summoned in due course to police HQ to give your official statement. Again? I've already done it three times since this morning. Sorry sir, regulations. Good grief... this'll teach me to get up at 7am. The butler, chop chop! In the good old days, it was always ladies first. These days, you're lucky if they do it in shipwrecks. I stumbled upon it last year by chance with my wife. A marvel, old pal. Good. 800F board, wine included. And you eat like gods. Are there fish? - Trout as big as your arm. I'll give you the address for your vacation. Great! If you have kids, it's 550 instead of 800. The press are here, inspector. Tell them the arrest of the guilty is imminent. Like usual? - Yes. Is that all? - It's too soon for the address. I'm very interested in what you've told me... So Dorgères left home yesterday evening at 8pm in a dinner jacket. Sir always wore a dinner jacket, even when dining alone. So do I. Do you know where he was going? No. I know he was meeting up with Miss... Miss Catherine? I know plenty, don't let it alarm you. It's Catherine... Catherine what, by the way? Villard, inspector. - "Villard", that's it. She lives in Rue... - 60, Rue Lauriston. That's it. Is she jealous? - Pardon? You never witnessed a violent scene, even through the door? I don't listen at doors. - One can hear without listening. Yes, indeed. But I never thought miss... You're not here to think, and neither am I. He wanted to dump her? I don't know about that, inspector. I recall a conversation sir had with Mrs Le Mesles a fortnight ago. It was in the grand salon. The door is very thin, and I was in the process of arranging sir's wardrobe. So, obviously... Of course. Mrs Le Mesles, you said. Who's she? A relative of sir's. She's a nice lady, most elegant. Her husband is an industrialist. Not the Le Mesles of the blast furnaces? I believe so, yes. And they were talking about Catherine? Yes. I first heard the phrase... You handled it well. - I know, chief. You're so intelligent, some nights it keeps me awake. So, this phrase? - Pardon? Oh yes, yes. Mrs Le Mesles said: "Believe me, Dorgères, that bitch Catherine is leading you on. "You're becoming ridiculous." How did he reply? Well, my goodness, he said something like: "And all thanks to you. Thanks very much." Well, well. What followed? I had to leave. The phone rang. You came back? Yes. Mrs Le Mesles and sir were leaving the grand salon. Sir had a face like thunder. He said: "I'll see to it, don't worry. But are you sure about these people?" What people? I don't know. But Mrs Le Mesles replied: "Absolutely. They're specialists. Their offices are somewhere on Rue Caumartin." That was it. That's interesting. Now... if you can tell me what time Dorgères returned last night, I'll give you the medal for old servants. I'm afraid there, honestly, I don't know. Certainly after 10am. That's the time I went to bed. Thanks. You can go. One more thing: how many sets of keys are there for the house? Three, inspector. Sir had one, I have one... And the third for flavour of the month? That's not for me to say. No, I worked it out myself. Goodbye, my friend. Dorgères' secretary is here. You want to see him? And how! This is starting to take shape. The lackey is no fool. He has good ears. - Yes. By the way, chief, we found this in the office. It's a button. As I was saying to myself. This button will lead us to the killer? Is this what you're thinking? - I'm thinking nothing. You might have a career yet. Look after it carefully, one never knows. Check it out. I have a thought. It doesn't commit me to anything and it keeps me company. You think it was a crime of passion? - Something like that. Disappointed, eh? You find it banal. Find something more banal than a crime and I'll buy you a meal. You're confident you're right. Bertrand Moal, secretary to Mr. Dorgères. Divisional inspector Bonnardel, I suppose. Exactly. Hello, sir. Thanks for coming. You know about the tragic events of last night? If you're alluding to the murder, I know about it. You don't seem too upset. I'm not the emotive sort. Bravo! With that and rheumatism, you could live to a ripe old age. Sit down, please, Mr. Moal. Were you his secretary for long? 32 months. You knew him well? - Let's say I knew him. Did he have any enemies? Not exactly, he didn't have friends. As a general rule, all the great financiers tend to be loners. Really? Loners can kill themselves. Rarely each other, in any event. To what end? The man disappears, but the money remains. It's the money that matters. It's better to ruin them. 9 times out of 10, they commit suicide. Thanks for the hint. It could come in useful. And yet, someone killed Dorgères. And I have the feeling we should be looking in his entourage. What do you think? I've no opinion on the subject. We know... We know Dorgères went out for a meal at 8pm, but we don't know where. I'd booked a private room for him for 8.30 at Lasserre. Interesting. A private room, you say? This irresistibly evokes the thought of a feminine presence. I might say that Dorgères seems to have liked that sort of distraction. What do you think, Mr. Moal? After all, you were his secretary. His secretary, not his clean-up crew. Ah, I see. I have great respect for others who show discretion, except in the matter of murder. That's your business, not mine. Can I go? I've a lot of work to do. My gratitude, Mr. Moal. Thanks all the same. Gentlemen. Say... Dorgères leaves an enormous fortune. He was a bachelor. Who gets their hands on the stash? He had family? He had a solicitor: Mr Delpiot, 140, Boulevard Malesherbes. Good day, gentlemen. If he killed someone, it would be tightly crafted. Yes. Curious personality. What are we going to do? - You know the score. It never changes. Proceed with your little tune. I'll grill the servants. After that, I'll visit the investigating judge. Meet at 5pm at HQ. Okay? Okay. Tread carefully at Le Mesles. They could be impressionable. I'll be preceded by a gypsy orchestra. And confirm the timetable for last night for Phalempeau. Get Sylvestre to help you. Send me the cook. Better make it the chauffeur: he smokes. I'll leave it to you. Inspector. Why so many questions on that Villard babe? She wants the Légion d'honneur, hence we must investigate her. Want one? That item set was delivered on 24th December to Ms Villard. 60, Rue Lauriston. With a paper knife? Naturally. Paper knives are part of our ensembles. Is that all? No. What are you doing Saturday? I'll be praying for you. Kind of you. Goodbye. Our offices don't open until 2pm. Didn't you see the notice? I'm highly myopic... Police. Is this the Intercontinental Agency? Yes, but I'm only minding the store. Our director general is actually in New York. Don't bother. You're called Bouteiller, Henri. You are at once the director general, the legal department and the whole crew of the Intercontinental Agency. We had to make some staff cuts. Oh yes... It's burning. - What? Oh... - Give it a stir. I always add an onion sliced very fine. Good. Now let's chat a bit. One of your clients, Mrs Le Mesles, recommended you to Mr. Dorgères. And that gentleman got you to tail a certain Catherine Villard. We'd like to know what that was about, and what you discovered about that girl. Go ahead. We know that Dorgères turned to a tracking agency on Rue Caumartin. And the thing is, there's only one: yours. Bad luck. Inspector, have you heard of professional confidentiality? The Intercontinental Agency has only one motto: "absolute discretion". I'm sorry. What did you say? I'm a little hard of hearing. Well, yes... Mr. Dorgères did hire me 8 days ago to follow a young lady Villard, 60, Rue Lauriston. The love life of that person was causing him some disquiet. However I discovered nothing, except that walking is a pastime best left to the young. She led you a merry dance? She made me walk round Galeries Lafayette 3 days in a row. In sum, you know nothing. - Yes, just one thing. Last Tuesday she received a letter from Barcelona and replied to it immediately. That letter was addressed to whom? Impossible to find out. If you think that sort of thing's easy... You spoke to Dorgères? Yes, the day before yesterday on the phone. He called me a fool, said he'd do it himself and that I should go hang myself. The ceiling's too low for that. Thanks, grandad. Are you sure there's nothing else? There's not another word I could tell you. You've wrung me dry. I'm telling you this is a disgusting job. I'm speaking of my own, obviously. I understood very well. Thanks. Bon appétit by the way. Pardon, madam. Is this the apartment of Ms Villard? Yes. - Is she out? There's no answer. You the police? - I'm a fridge salesman. It's like I always say... Gelolux Ltd, happiness is in the cold. This was bound to happen sooner or later to that hussy. You mean Ms Villard? Don't call her "Ms"? That slut. Never in bed before 3am, never up before two in the afternoon, boozing, the radio blaring so much it makes you deaf. And with a handsome brown guy who goes down with his shoes in his hand. It's that doctor on the 3rd floor, another oddball. Did Ms Villard come back last night? No. She left at 7pm. Nobody since then. She had her coat on, the one she hasn't paid for. How do you know this? An employee at Fath told me. She'd asked her 4 times, but nothing doing. Yet, she has money. She'd had enough of him, her industrialist. The only thing is: handsome brown men don't come cheap. To sum up, she hasn't been back since yesterday evening? I'd stake my life on it. - Good idea. Goodbye, madam. I hope she's croaked. It'll teach her to hit my Kiki. Ah, it's because of Kiki. I though it had to be something of that sort. Come in. Can I help you? Are you the concierge? That's my wife. I drive the taxi. Is she here? I'd like to speak to her. Do you know her? Why do you want to see her? So she can tell me about her time in Hollywood. It's for 'Cine Review'. Police. Get on with it. A cop? Has she done something? Are you going to move it or not? Étiennette! What's up? This gentleman from the police wants to see you. Blimey, I'd never have guessed. - I'm better than the usual, eh? It's about your tenant, Mr. Phalempeau. He's done something? No. He was in an accident yesterday evening at 11pm. A car ran off the road. A passer-by noted the number. It matches his car. They're sorting it out, but we have to check. Mr. Phalempeau went out yesterday evening? He never goes out in the evening. - Including yesterday? He never goes out in the evening! You were in your lodge? Obviously. Where else would she be? I am the concierge, you know. Fine. Thanks. And sorry to disturb you. Think nothing of it, inspector. Don't tell Mr. Phalempeau. He'd take it the wrong way. - Étiennette minds her own business. Good idea. I recommend that you do... Oh! Yes, Amélie? A gentleman is asking to speak to Madam. At least a man is. - A gentleman or a man? He says he's from the police. Then he's a policeman. Show him in. Very well, madam. Hello, sir. You want to speak to me? Yes, madam. Inspector Richard. Delighted to make your acquaintance, inspector. You've got me very intrigued. Sit down, please. Port, cognac, whiskey? - No alcohol, thank you. It'll be our secret. Not even now? Not even now. - So, fire away. What's this about? - About a murder, madam. I think you're read about it in the newspaper, the one under the cushion. Well, bravo, inspector. Most impressive. Yes, of course I've read about it. It's curious all the same, this perverted need to lie to the police. It's well known. We call it a guilty conscience. It's an affliction of the innocent. You reassure me. So, you want to interview me about poor Dorgères? Yes. I gather he was a friend of yours. That's putting it a bit strong. No, Dorgères was an associate of my husband's. He had dinner here about ten times, but as for being a friend... What about Catherine Villard? She was Dorgères' mistress. Did you know her? Yes. This is why I didn't want to look like I had a particular interest in the death of Dorgères. I don't want to talk about Catherine. For fear of having too much to say? If you like. She was a model in the fashion house that dressed me at the time. I thought she seemed interesting. She must have gone to a lot of trouble to give that impression. I fell for it, and she became my friend. Was she doing drugs at that time? You're making me very uncomfortable. Am I obliged to answer? But you have answered, madam. Thank you. She had every other vice, so why not that one? I liked Catherine very much. When the company employing her closed, I wanted to find her a stable job. Since she spoke English and Spanish, I asked Dorgères if he could put her to good use. Which he did, subsequently. I didn't know the police had a sense of humour. We do everything we can to keep it secret. Was it from when she became Dorgères' mistress that your disillusionment started? Probably. I thought she was a friend. She was a gold-digger. She didn't even have the excuse of caprice or seeking an adventure. Dorgères repulsed her, but he was rich. You sought an explanation? I told him what I thought. She then revealed her true colours, venal, mean, ready to do anything for 1000F notes. Dorgères was a brute. I'd rather talk about something else. So would I. And you learnt that she had another lover. And you went to inform Dorgères. You're decidedly well-informed. That's correct. Almost. Dorgères asked me to visit. He was getting suspicious. Catherine was spending money so quickly. You advised him to contact the Intercontinental Agency? Why question me if you know it all? We don't know it all, madam. One last question: do you happen to know Catherine Villard's other lover? No. I knew he existed. I know he exists. Catherine extracted money from Dorgères to give it to him. You'll have your proof someday. She'll confess it in the end. With 2 testimonies like yours, she could even have the luxury of denying it until the end. You questioned me, I answered. I'm ready to repeat everything in court. I don't doubt it. Thank you, madam. My respects. Good evening, chaps. - Good evening, doctor. Your manhunt, is it going well? Slow down. I've 2, 3 questions. The judge has just sent me your conclusions from the autopsy. Cervical bulb pierced, rapid death, etc. Perfect. They couldn't have hoped for better. You say the blade followed a slightly oblique path, from down to up. - Yes. We can assume the killer was shorter than the victim? Assume what you like. I observe. It could be a woman? - Why not. Dorgères was stabbed like a bull in the ring. And women toreadors do exist, my friend. On that thought, I'm going. My wife's taking me to the cinema. Enjoy your evening, doctor. Do you have a cigarette? Ah, I don't smoke. - Why's that? It makes you cough. Chewing-gum, chief? - Why not a lollipop? It's starting to get a human face, this Dorgères' business. You have a favorite? The Villard kid, 3-1. Ah, there... She's in the frame, that doll. It's open-and-shut. Only a woman would stab a guy in the back. She buys him a small gift with his dough, and 2 months later, uses it to kill him. Life's funny. The prosecutor will have a field day with the jury. "She killed him with the paper knife that she had given him!" She'll cop the maximum sentence. That depends if she's a cutie. In that respect, nobody could blame him. Oh, pardon. - You see? Pity to remove her from circulation. 24 years old and a corpse on her hands. Good grief. One wonders what the world's coming to. Ah, it's you. 20 journalists are waiting. Give them their crumbs. I saw. Before anything else, give me a cigarette. Drat, I forgot to pick them up. Sorry, chief. Right. If this is a set-up, we'll never mention it again. Catherine Villard indeed dined with Dorgères at the restaurant. It didn't go well. They were heard shouting in the corridor. They left together around 9.30. I'll put the details in my report. The old geezer at the Intercontinental Agency gave me a crumb. Dorgères asked him to follow Villard. She received a letter from Barcelona and she'd answered it. He alerted Dorgères. - Return of the gigolo. And Mrs Le Mesles? She knows nothing. Simple character witness. She'd recommended the babe to Dorgères, but not as a bedmate. Her opinion on the girl? Lamentable. I thought she was overdoing it. According to her, Catherine uses drugs and she supports a gigolo. On top of that, she's fled the scene. She's not been back to her apartment since yesterday evening. Gauthier stands sentry on her doorstep. Nothing will come of it. She must be with this other guy. How would you explain that? It could be coincidence. Why not? I could be Greta Garbo. She wanted to kill the guy the moment she was holding the paper knife. No need to reinvent the wheel. Background, motive, opportunity: it all points to her. Couldn't be better. We should glance at the alternatives though. Phalempeau, for example. - Oh no. He was snoring. I saw the concierge. - And the secretary? He has an alibi? Who? Moal? - Yeah. None. If he committed murder, he'd have one made of cast-iron. And why would he kill Dorgères? He's the guy who buttered his sandwiches. You're still in the romance stage of this job. Flair, intuition... "The guilty are innocent." Yes, I've been there. You'll get over it before it recaptures me. Look at Sylvestre. He does the job well. Later, he'll go home to sleep. He won't have any dreams. He has as much imagination as a breeze block, but he's one of the best. And how. Yes, I know. It wouldn't hurt to check a few small things. Moal, Mrs Le Mesles... and this button, it might offer a new lead. 2 days before he was struck down, Dorgères gave a house party. His office was used as the cloakroom. They piled up over a hundred overcoats. If you'd enjoy working through them... This is done and dusted. Unleash the hounds. We'll take what we've got to the judge. It's up to him what he makes of it. Let's give this to the blood-drinkers. Oh. I don't want them to write a word about the paper knife. Okay. Let them go to town on the kid, I'm okay with that. Front page, mysterious disappearance of principal witness, "where is the companion of dead financier?" Your career is safe as houses. We're talking France-Soir. Thanks. I owe you one. Inspector, any news? Calm down, calm down. Come on. Is miss retaining the room? I don't know yet. Probably. Are these the Paris newspapers? - Yes. They've just arrived. What's the matter? Miss? Miss? Miss? My God! Hello, police? This is Hotel de Bellevue. I say again, I didn't kill him. Of course, of course. He died of old age. Okay... Let's try another tack. Tell me about your meal at the restaurant, for instance. How'd that go? You need a hand? Dorgères asked you to meet him at the restaurant at 8.30. He'd reserved a private room, because he wanted to discuss something intimate with you. He wanted to dump you. No. It was me who was going to dump him. I'd wanted to do it for some time. And that evening nothing was going to stop me. Ah, here you are... at last! It's 9.15, we'd arranged for 8.30. I don't like being made to wait, as you know. I'm sorry. Where have you been? Not at home, I telephoned. The couturier and the hairdresser close at 8. Only bachelor pads remain open. You've been disgusting me for a while now. I remember when you were less insolent. You've learnt quickly. Just in the time I've known you. The blossoming of a young girl's personality is always something to behold, even when it's done at your expense. That said, shall we eat? I have to talk to you - So do I. Me first. Gladly. On condition it doesn't take too long. I've work to do. Are you hungry? - No. You're going to ask for money, I suppose? No. My freedom. It's over. You've found someone better? Better than us wouldn't be difficult. Except at the end of the month... But that's another story. For the last time, you've anticipated my desires. It's a question of profession, no doubt. Bravo. So, you've had enough of me. Well, the same here. And not just now either. I was going to tell you this evening, but you spoke first. You're free to go, it's unimportant. - I wanted to inform you. Handing in your notice? There's no need. I don't need to be prepared for this great shock. A girl leaving is like losing a key. Changing the lock does the trick. The door still opens just the same. Don't try to humiliate me. You're wasting your time. That's not one of my habits. I know where to strike, and I strike where it hurts! Don't show off, it's useless. Be happy to cash in. That at least you know how to do. You won't leave me any regrets. I got what I wanted from you: your body! All at a reasonable price. I've no complaints. Understand, I'm keeping the jewelry. It can be of further service. Find yourself the perfect pimp, but not with my money. A pimp will make a change from a shark. [N.B. Pimp = mackerel in French] Men like you don't deserve to live! What happened next? I left. He rejoined me in the corridor as if nothing had happened. Probably because of the maître d'. We got in his car. I asked him to drop me off at the first street. What street? - I don't know. What time was that? - I don't know. Okay. I get the feeling we've arrived at the moment where you're not going to know anything anymore. It doesn't matter, continue all the same. I walked aimlessly. My head was reeling. Streets, squares, more streets... Which proves you walk easily. I don't. And this walkabout just happened to end up at Gare de Lyon, where there was a train for Marseilles waiting. That's how it was? - No. I caught the métro at l'Étoile. I wanted to get out immediately, I didn't care where or how. I soon got to the station. It must've been 10.45. The Marseilles' express is at 11.40. Is this what you call "leaving as quickly as possible"? Why not Gare du Nord or Gare de l'Est? Why Gare de Lyon? And why Marseilles? - I don't know. Don't take God's children for fools. You went to Marseilles because it's a port and because they have boats coming and going... from Spain, for example. I don't understand. And the letter you received from Barcelona? Untrue, you're lying! - Idiot! Your little boyfriend wrote it, the one who slept at yours a month ago and who went downstairs holding his shoes. No! You need a culprit, and you've said to yourself I fit the bill! I didn't kill him! I didn't kill him! Forget the waterworks, I'm waterproof. And the Conservatoire is on the other bank. I'm offending your sensibilities? A little. At least, what's left of them. Sorry you have to play nursemaid. I have another version of the story. Dorgères knew that you'd had a Spaniard in your bed. He dropped you off but you went back to his. You had the keys. The row kicked off again. You saw red. You saw the paper knife on the bureau... I didn't kill Dorgères. I didn't kill Dorgères. Come on now... be sensible. It wasn't your fault. You'd taken drugs earlier in the day. They messed with your judgment. And then Dorgères was a bastard. What does it matter? One more, one less... With a pretty face like yours and a good lawyer, it'll be a cakewalk. Come on. Confess. You'll see how much better you'll sleep afterwards. I didn't kill Dorgères. For fuck's sake! Okay, you didn't kill him... Can you explain to me why you fled to Marseilles by the first train, in the middle of the night, without baggage and without stopping off at home? I've already told you this. I wanted to get away from Dorgères, get away from him quickly, not see him again, flee. I knew if I stayed in Paris, he could find me any time he wanted. He was having me followed. Oh yes? For several days, I'd been followed by an elderly gentleman. He runs an agency on Rue Caumartin. How do you know this? - I followed him. Most amusing. Anything else to declare? You stand by what you've said? - Yes. Okay, this interview is over. You'll be spending the night with us. Tomorrow, I'll introduce you to the investigating judge. He loves stories from Marseilles. Am I charged with murder? That's up to the judge, not me. For the moment, it's "case against X". But you're looking very like this X, that's for sure. Put her on ice and come back. Come on, miss. Hello. judge Ferrand's office. If he's already gone, call him at home. She wants Landry as her lawyer. I told her she can write to him from prison. Landry? Well... Hello? Good day, judge. This is Bonnardel. Yes. That's right, she's coming from here. Oh, well... The soup is cooked. Yes, we can eat whenever you like. Tomorrow, 9pm? Very well. Goodbye, judge. I'm ugly, eh? I revolt you? You think I enjoy this? Your purring can be heard 3 metres away. That's right. So what? I'm just doing my job. To be a cop is to be hated by honest people and scumbags. It's not a profession for the ego, it's a profession born out of necessity. It's my profession, chief. Not fully yet, but that will come. Some day you'll resemble me. Then it'll be your turn to smoke the cigarettes of some young dimwit. DISCOVERED IN MARSEILLES, CATHERINE VILLARD IS CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF RAOUL DORGESES. She selects Landry as her defense counsel. Yes? Hello, sir. - Hello. Have you readied your findings? Yes. I see you've heard the news. Yes. I've even received an official letter from Catherine Villard. She has some flair, that woman. If she's as good with a pen as she is with a stiletto... An act of faith that calls for an act of charity. Have you decided yet? - No, not yet. "An attractive woman compromised in a high-profile murder is something never to be refused", as my old teacher said. This case looks pretty bad. What do you think? There's no doubting the guilt. Plus it wasn't a crime of passion. If women start killing their men as well... She stabbed him from behind. - Not very poetic. A 6.35 is proper, mechanical. But a knife... There's also the drugs, the mysterious Spanish lover and the flight to Marseilles. In your opinion, it's a chance to come a cropper. Very much so. In that case, I can't hesitate. I accept. I knew you would. My friend, you are a genuine Machiavelli. Make an appointment with the investigating judge. I can confirm it to the newspapers? - Yes. I'm defending Catherine Villard. It's official. One day, I met Dorgères at the Le Mesles. After about an hour, I was looking for a way to be unpleasant to him. I've found it. Another settling of accounts. Hello? Yes, that's here. Mr. Landry's secretary speaking. On behalf of whom? But, sir... Okay. Right, I'll see. Someone wants to speak to you about the Dorgères' case. Thanks. No, stay. Hello? This is Mr Landry. Really? Indeed. I've understood perfectly well, sir. Whenever you like. As soon as possible, obviously. Okay. Agreed. Goodbye, sir. Tomorrow at 11am, I'll be meeting the mysterious Spanish lover of Catherine Villard. Let me give you some advice. Sit down. That's the advice, trust me. Sit down. Get over it! You'll drive yourself nuts. There are two things to do in jail: snooze or talk it over. I've even known some do both at the same time. So, what did you do to wind up in the slammer? Nothing. Neither did I, imagine that! Nobody's done anything here. The place is full of judicial errors. Isn't that right, Mrs Krowski? Did you do something? - Not this. A birth that went wrong. I ask you... These things happen. I said to the judge: "If you think it's so easy, you try it." The problem is she had ten of them in a row. She'll have trouble convincing them she didn't do it on purpose... Ah, life's a bitch. What about you? Me? Me, doll, I was a manicurist. "Young manicurist, very experienced, appointments 2-7pm." It was working out so well I had a friend come in to lend me a hand. That was my mistake... She fell asleep on a client's purse. It was me who got the blame. It seems I was responsible. Yes you were, my dear The law on joint enterprises is clear. Oh, all right, drop it. To you, now. You should talk. It's soothing. I'm accused of murder. Oh... You, at least, are no small fry. You wiped out a guy? Tell us about it. I'm innocent. Of course, my coquette, of course. So, tell us about your innocence. I'm innocent, you hear? Innocent! I didn't kill him! - Easy, you'll do yourself a mischief. Innocent! I want someone to believe me! Someone must believe me! They must believe me! They must believe me! I didn't kill him! I didn't... They should create prisons for the innocent. These people are insufferable. Oh, I believe you, come on. You couldn't be making it up, or you'd win an Academy Award. Come on. You didn't kill him. Even if you did kill him, so what? There are too many men anyway. And if you really didn't do it, you might be freed. With a little luck... A good lawyer is important, especially for the innocent. Who's yours? - Landry. Landry QC. At least, I think so. Landry? He's a big shot, that guy. He'd get the devil out of hell. Don't worry. You're practically on the Champs-Élysées. Oh... Oh, the Champs-Élysées. They aren't the brightest in the police, but it's curious how they could be so mistaken. You don't have an alibi, I suppose. - No. No alibi. Well, she couldn't have known in advance. That's right. You want one? It's easy. I know a respectable man, a doctor. He no longer practices, but he does all sorts of favours. You send him a note and he'll testify that at such-and-such a time you were with him, doing something you didn't dare say, out of modesty for example. You can choose what. You realise, he'll do this on oath. You think he'd agree? I think so. It's not free, obviously. But 50,000F, one can always raise it with legs like yours. And you pay after getting out. If you're interested, I know what to write. I can take care of the letter. I get out tomorrow. Hold on. What if it goes wrong? But he's a good man. Old colonial doctor and all that... He almost won the Legion of Honour. Now this is his vocation. Are you sure of your gumshoe doctor? An innocent, I'm telling you, like yourself. You can write the letter this evening. Ms Villard, your defense lawyer wants to speak with you. The case against you looks bad, it seems as if you are the only possible culprit. Not that you don't know this. I didn't kill Dorgères, I swear to you. And I believe you. Sadly, it's witnesses and not the accused who give evidence under oath. In this case, the witnesses are all hostile. And that's not all... There's your attitude that seems curious, not to say suspicious, in many respects. I don't understand. And I want to understand. You've only told part of the truth. Why? This trip to Marseilles, for instance. The most difficult part of this job is to win the trust of clients. Look at me. I'm your friend, the only one, the last one you have left. I must also be your confidante. It's the only way I can save you. Talk. I can't work miracles. You expect the impossible of me. I know. I know I'm a lost cause. Too bad. Forget it, forget me. Thanks for coming. Hold on. In the press and at the Palais, they call me "the bulldog", because when I've grabbed a bone I never let go. Remain silent, since that's what you've decided to do. It doesn't matter. Another will no doubt speak on your behalf. Who? Nobody can speak in my place. Not even this mysterious Spaniard you've been concealing so carefully? I have a meeting with him tomorrow. He contacted me. Pierre? Nice to know his first name. You have no right to do this. I forbid you. He knows nothing. He can't tell anything important in my defense. She didn't kill this man. She's incapable of it. I can't prove it. This is of no interest. She wasn't running away, she was rejoining me in Marseilles. This is what's held against her. I'd written to her from Barcelona, telling her I'd be arriving. She wasn't fleeing. Why? Once the blow is struck, she runs into her lover's arms. The banal reflex of a murderess. Otherwise, why would she depart without luggage? She'd just broken up with Dorgères, he'd hit her. She was shaken up, she wanted to be with me. It's possible. So is the contrary. Anything is possible. No need to get upset. Part of my job is to anticipate the arguments of the other side. Thanks. Now, fill me in on the background. How did you meet Catherine Villard? In Barcelona, 8 months ago, in a bar in Boqueria. I'm Spanish of French Catalan origin. I sale as mechanic on the trawlers. Catherine was in Barcelona as a tourist with Dorgères. That's how we met. - By pure chance? No. At that time, I dealt a little coke. Yes, it's a dirty business. However it isn't always easy to earn enough for two meals a day. After we've mixed it with bicarbonate, it doesn't do that much harm. That's your opinion. What happened next? Some pals in Paris had tipped off Catherine. The bar in question was my HQ. One evening she dropped in to refuel. I wanted to see her again. The next day I had no desire to sell drugs to anyone, especially not to her. It was as simple as that. I'm in love with her. And now I've straightened myself out. You carried on seeing each other? - Yes, whenever we could. Last month, I was in Paris for a few days. That's when I asked her to leave Dorgères. I realise the two of us was the real thing, serious. Poor kid. She wept like a baby. Why didn't she say you were in Marseilles to the police? Because I'm not permitted to disembark in Marseilles. I have a three year prohibition. - Bravo. That explains everything. A drug case. It's hardly a case. That all said, I can go and tell my little story to the police? Don't do that. Your testimony proves nothing. The truth doesn't cut the mustard with everyone. - No kidding. She's a woman without secrets but also a right snob, and only seen with the best families. I won't call on you unless absolutely necessary. You know what it could cost you. I've played the game for 10 years. I know the rules somewhat. If you need me, I'm at the Hotel Florida. Okay. Don't tell Catherine. She'd freak out. Besides, she has enough on her plate as it is. I promise. You're not such a bad sort. And neither are you. It's a nice surprise for both of us. You're right. This is very interesting. Thanks, old chap. - It's further evidence. The case was considerable even without this letter. It's a godsend. The case is practically sealed, Bonnardel. You're content, I hope. The only case I'll enjoy settling will be the last one before I retire. The good horses die in harness. A cashew? - I can't stand them. I'll admit I prefer cigarettes. The key is to alternate. I do one day of each. Are you happy with Richard? Is he working out? He's still raw, but he's a good seed. As long as it's you doing the sowing, I'm happy. May I? Please do. This is the right place. Hello. Do you know chief inspector Bonnardel? The devil I do! I owe half my clients to him. Hello, inspector. - Hello, sir. Everything going well? You've put another innocent into custody. All your clients are judicial errors, who doesn't know this? I was going to see you for a talk tomorrow, but since you're here now... It's about the Dorgères' case. - Well... Please, my dear Bonnardel. Cigarette? No, thanks. I'm on cashews only. Oh, pardon. Thanks. I've been studying the Villard file. Interesting. Thanks. Somewhat thin, but interesting. Really? - Well yes, to be frank. There's nothing against my client except vague presumptions, based mostly on dubious witnesses. This is what interests me. The maître d' at the restaurant loathed Catherine Villard. He admitted it himself. The next-door neighbour is obviously a mad old fantasist. As for the testimony of Mrs Le Mesles, it poses a different problem, I'll admit. But the end result is the same. In short, the case is rather thin. So it appears to me. I have in my hands something that fattens the file considerably. Instead of finding it too thin, I think that you'll now find it too fat. Isn't that right, Bonnardel? Well, let's just say that there's some new evidence. Ah, these young women are so imprudent! How this ravishing Catherine needlessly complicates your task. I won't leave you hanging. Here's a letter in which your client makes demands of a notorious deviant, one well known to Bonnardel's service, to secure for her a fake alibi for the night of the murder. No need to outline for you the impact this will have on the jury. It's equivalent to a confession. And how did you get your hands on this letter? The usual. Catherine Villard thought she could entrust it to a fellow prisoner. And this woman, hoping for something in return, handed it to a guard. What do you say now, old chap? - Not very much. From the tone of the letter, it's irrefutable that my client didn't know the individual whom she was addressing. It would be interesting to know how she knew about him. It appears nothing more than a vulgar provocation to which she gave in in a moment of panic. That is more proof of her candour than her guilt. She wrote the letter. Naïvety is the sister of innocence. Paradox. - Admittedly. That makes just one more in this case. You know the profound admiration I have for your perspicacity. Sadly, to err is to be human. It's just one more in a series of worrying coincidences. A magistrate of your calibre shouldn't attach to them such great importance. Don't forget that truth, like bombs, is often time-delayed. And if you have another lead, I give you some friendly advice not to neglect it. That's all. I must be going now. Goodbye, old chap. Goodbye, inspector. See you soon. I wouldn't like to play poker with that guy. He bluffs too well. I should never have gone up to 4 hearts, my dear Le Mesles, but I know how much you like desperate situations. I've honestly done all I could to put you in the mire. Nice of you to come and entertain the exiles. These evenings are unbearable. Sit down, won't you? You're not very talkative. The Dorgères' case got you preoccupied? It seems like she's not much more than a chance for another trophy to add to your cabinet. What's a man like you doing in that madhouse? A lawyer in a madhouse, it seems to me not that unusual. I know the case against Villard is a weighty one. I pity the poor girl. Nice demonstration of Christian charity, my friend. You'll be featured in the calendar. I pity her for having roused so much hatred. It's mostly yours that I'm thinking of. Already making the big speeches? Is this an appeal? If you like. I've read your testimony. It's the only one that has nothing to do with the murder, and yet it's the most pitiless of the lot. I'd even say the most intelligent. I didn't mean that as a compliment. Certain intelligences make idiocy all the more regrettable. You're reminding me of my husband, who only stops being tedious when he becomes objectionable. Give me a cigarette. - Oh, you didn't lie. I can swear that every detail of your testimony is correct. But you know very well, too well, that there are two ways to present the truth. Of course. I am hearing your appeal. But at least with the excuse of defending someone else's liberty. However why are you so relentless against Catherine Villard? Strange that you ask questions to which you well know the answers. I've never claimed... Don't switch too suddenly to politeness. You'll disappoint me. If I'm relentless against Catherine, to use your phrase, you know perfectly well why. These are the sort of things that should be whispered among friends. The secret of Polichinelle, or better still, of Columbine. I hate her, all right, and with all my soul. I hate her... for being too lovely. I don't ask you to understand or forgive this attachment. I don't care what you think. Yes. Yes, my testimony was an act of passion. My whole life's never been anything else. The day Catherine sold herself to Dorgères, I could've killed her. I wanted to kill myself. My thanks to you for not laughing. That's generally the prerogative of fools. That was the work of an artist. Your 4 hearts are done. Are you coming over? Deal the cards. I'll be there in a moment. Watch out, my dear Le Mesles. Women are always susceptible to eloquence. You're hoping to get me to retract my statement, to reconsider my testimony. Well, no, my friend. I'm not the forgiving sort. This could run and run. - I know. Well, go ahead. Raise up a scandal if you can. You're not yet big enough to worry me. You'll break your back trying. Good luck. Well, Landry, are you coming? Here, I give him back to you. We were talking about women. He's clueless. He's a typical man. Follow the button to find the killer? Is that your plan? No, I'm sorry. You might try at... There were plenty made in Italy, just before the war. Say, you. These benches aren't made for sleeping. Don't you have a bed at home? I think that I have. - Then move it along. Bloody pigs. Pardon, sir. Excuse me, madam. Hold on, miss. Get off me. I'm catching the bus. - I'll buy you a Cadillac. I'll call an officer. - I am the police. Where'd you get those buttons? I've buttons, me? No. I mean the ones on your coat. Where'd you get them? From my uncle. What's it to you? Your uncle is a tailor? - Yes, why? Grab a taxi. You're an angel. Taxi! You had some luck bumping into Jacqueline. Without her, you'd never have found me. I've been retired from business for two years. I remember this clearly. It was 1944, on the eve of the Liberation. An Italian representative came offering me this item. At that time, you took what was going. It was out of the question to be difficult. Let me tell you, I ate soy chops in a buffet in Marseilles. That was in 1943, around the end of August. I'd arrived in Marseilles... Uncle André. - What? He's not here to listen to this. I'll admit I'm pressed for time. "Pressed", of course. It's the sickness of these times. In my day, we required 5 weeks to finish a suit but it was a masterpiece. Today they aren't tailors, but butchers. Take yours for example. He did a bad job with your two armholes. Poor France. Everyone has their obsession. Yours, for instance, is buttons. I kept all my registers. Yes, I look at them occasionally. It stops me growing old too quick. I always noted every detail of a costume, opposite the name of the client. Another tradition that's been lost. Let's see... You take yourself for a footballer? Police. Again? Do you pass addresses around? I've come for a small chat. You can put the smile away, I'll do without. Here's a fine way to talk. I'm calling my husband! Don't bother, your husband is out driving his car like he does every other night. Not that you mind too much. You sneak in the blond guy who delivers the groceries. You're shocked? The whole neighbourhood knows. Blondie rolls in as soon as your husband leaves. At 10pm, you close the lodge and switch on the automatic opening. At 4am, blondie leaves. The rest doesn't concern me. - That's a relief. Given this, people can come and go without anyone knowing. And that's just what happened the other night with Mr. Phalempeau. That evening, blondie was being of service. You're not the sort one discusses this with. Perfect. I like you better this way. Tomorrow morning, you'll come to make a new statement, this way your husband can continue to drive his taxi. You get my meaning? Somewhat, yes. I'm flighty, but I'm not stupid. Splendid. Sometimes, one wishes one was blond. These are the exact words of my statement, or very close to it. Where do I sign? There's nothing you want to add, Mr. Phalempeau? Some detail that has come to mind later, for example? - Not at all. Then initial the first page and sign at the bottom of the second. Here. Thanks. I can leave? Be my guest. Thanks again for putting up with the inconvenience. No problem, inspector. Chief, a man wants to speak with you. - Show him in. You can go in. Well, Mr. Phalempeau. Gentlemen. This is a surprise. - Sir? You don't remember me? Dugaulin, the tailor, Rue Vivienne. Nice to see you again. - Same here. Good day, sir. I see that you still hold the faith with old Papa Dugaulin. It's good to see. It won't wear out that. They'll bury you in it. Pardon? No, I mean your coat. I recognised it immediately. It looks great! Here, you've altered the buttons. Possibly. Goodbye. I'd put on black buttons. Don't you remember? - No, sir. Excuse me. I'd like to leave. - Wait a moment. I'd like us to talk a little more, if it's not inconvenient. I'm in a hurry. Just a small formality. It's just that in this Dorgères' case there's the question of a button that's been bothering me. Since you were talking about this, let's take advantage. This is nuts. But Mr. Dugaulin, who was here quite by chance, said something that I find very interesting. You changed your buttons? What's it got to do with anything? I'm only asking if it's true, that's all. Mr. Dugaulin could be mistaken. He's not so young anymore. Well, he is mistaken. I haven't changed the buttons. Ah. This is a great weight off my shoulders. The problem is, in Mr. Dugaulin's records is a formal record about this coat recording the presence of black buttons. However it's perfectly obvious they're no longer there. It's funny. Once again, what are you getting at? We'd like Mr. Dugaulin to inspect your coat. And if I refuse? - It won't make any difference. You're not going to have the audacity to lay a hand on me? I have connections, you realise. Shall I show him ours, chief ? Calm down. No, I'm certain Mr. Phalempeau will reconsider. You'll be hearing from me. - I hope it'll be something good. I'm sorry, Mr. Phalempeau, but the buttons on this clothing have been changed. I'd even say the work was very recent and that it was done by an amateur. It breaks my heart. The choice of thread, the size of the buttons and their alignment... No professional tailor would make these mistakes. I'll await the rest. Haven't you worked it out? We found at the scene of the crime a black button which Mr. Dugaulin states resembles those of your coat. Plus you've recently changed, no doubt with your own hands, those buttons for other buttons. From this we ask ourselves if you didn't make this substitution to evade eventual suspicion. You'd better correct this misapprehension quick. I advise you not to jump to hasty conclusions. I changed those buttons because I didn't like them. You affirmed that you hadn't changed them. Your attitude exasperated me. I said the first thing that came into my head. You're trying to find evidence I was in Dorgères' office, but I've never set foot in there. And the button you claim to have found there would only mean something in this case if I was the only one wearing that type of button. Your faithful assistant, Mr. Dugaulin, can tell you this. I know that you're intelligent. Thanks, Mr. Dugaulin. You can go. Thank you, inspector. I'm sorry, Mr. Phalempeau. It's the first time I've done I've done this to a customer. But they told me my testimony might save that young woman. She's only 24. I'm sure you understand. And now, choose. Let me leave or charge me with the murder of Dorgères. At your own risk, obviously. Well? But you're a free man. All I ask is you wait until inspector Sylvestre returns, who has one last check to perform. Sit yourself down. I can be patient another 5 minutes. Well, did you find anything? Yes. This. It was in his car? In Phalempeau's car, wrapped in a cloth. What did you say? In my car? You own a Vedette 5922 AP 75? What's this paper knife doing in your car? Liar! You planted it in my car! You needed evidence to incriminate me! You planted the weapon in my car to indict me for the crime! Bastards! This time we've got you. The murder weapon, you say? How do you know it's the murder weapon? None of the newspapers mentioned a paper knife. Nobody was ever told what Dorgères was struck down with. Except the chief, Sylvestre, me... and the killer. Have you finished pinching my stuff? Sorry, chief. Of course you realise that's not the real paper knife, and it was never in your car. The real one I guess you've got stashed somewhere. I threw it in the Seine. Why did you kill Dorgères? He was a scumbag. I'd laboured ten years to get that African cotton mill working. And he was going to steal it from me. We had a meeting the following day, but I wanted to speak to him beforehand. I got there around 10.40... It was him who let me in. I begged him to show pity at least once in his life. He shrugged his shoulders. I wept. He insulted me. So... I don't know anymore. The paper knife was there, on the desk, in front of me... I struck at him at random... I'm not at all sorry. Men like Dorgères... don't deserve to live. Someone had already told him that. Come on. Everything was ready for me to depart for South America. Once down there, I was going to send you a letter exonerating Catherine Villard. I swear. I hope they'll believe you, Mr. Phalempeau. So, young man, pleased with yourself? Somewhat. I hope you don't mind, chief. Go ahead, old chap, do a cartwheel. You wouldn't be the first chicken [cop] to believe he is a peacock. No, joking aside: it's been most impressive, lad. You've shown initiative, you worked your butt off, you showed intelligence. Just don't make a habit of it. I'll watch myself. - Fine. Come on, let's go. Do you like beef miroton? - Oh, so-so. Well, you'll love this one. I'm paying. We must be back at 2pm for the Villard kid. She's one who'll light a candle for you. Have you noticed, chief? You've lost a button. My wife will be furious. Hi. - Hi. Thanks for coming. It's nice of you. I wanted to be here to see my greatest plea getting away. Pity you were innocent. You'll forget this nightmare. At your age, wounds heal quickly. What are you going to do now? Know what I'd do in your place? I'd go to Rue Lepic. They have a quiet hotel called Le Florida. And in that hotel, there's a young man not quite so quiet... called Pierre. It's...? Really? Since when has a lawyer not spoken the truth?... Thank you.
