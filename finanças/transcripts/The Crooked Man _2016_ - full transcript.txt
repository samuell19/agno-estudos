[GIRL 1] Speaking of songs, have any of you heard of the one that kills you after you sing it? - Oh, come on. - [GIRL 1] I saw it online. Then it has to be real. No, she's right. Apparently these boys down in Milford tried it. Two of them died, like full-on tongues hanging out, bones shattered, dead. They make that stuff up so kids don't believe - everything they see online. - Prove it. - No way. - What's wrong, Olive? If it's not real, there's nothing to be afraid of, right? You're serious.

She was working at a store in town. She sure had the judge convinced. Crazy little Olive. The girl who killed her friend. Six years is a long time, Livy. People move on. They forget. Mom didn't. [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome home, Olivia. [WOMAN] Crazy Olivia's back from the loony bin. It's a small town. People talk. Livy! [GASPS] Whoa, Livy. You scared me. Is everything OK, Livy? It's fine.

After breakfast, do you think you can take me somewhere? Sure. Anywhere in particular? I'd love something to read that's not for 12-year-olds. [SCOFFS] OK. Hm... It's like they've never seen a pretty girl before. You're Olivia Shaw. Noah. Becky Harris' brother. Noah! Wow. You're a... a cop? What can I say? Family business. How is Becky anyway? She's down at Brown. She's a freshman. So what's it like being back home? [SIGHS] It's a little weird. And then there's that. Hey, would you like a selfie or maybe an autograph? [GIRL] Murderer.

I might have a piece of wood big enough to cover that glass. Promise me you'll just try to calm down. When you have a daughter, you'll understand. [MAN OF TV]Thank you very much. Coming up on News 5, more information on the tragic death of a local lawyer who apparently fell out an upper story window of his Eastborough office last night. [WOMAN ON TV]Steven, who was 28, is described by his colleagues as a hardworking and thoughtful young attorney. A lifelong resident of Eastborough, many remember Steven as a bright and ambitious student who delivered pizzas while putting himself through law school. [MAN ON TV] We'll talk with the man who saw it happen. Plus, your five day weather for... [MAN] There is no easy way to describe the loss of someone like Steven, someone with such hope and promise for the future. A light that shined so brightly, but could be snuffed out so easily. Whatever problems Steven had in this world, whatever demons he may have been facing, we can find comfort and solace in the fact that his soul is now in a better place, a place where love and peace are eternal, where there is no pain and suffering. And we know that one day we shall be reunited with him, in this glorious heaven. "I lift up my eyes to the hills. Where does my help come from? My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and Earth." In accordance with his wishes, we now return Steven to the Earth, which he enjoyed so much. This must feel familiar for you. You're gonna start that now? It would've been her birthday today, you know that? No. Well, she's in a graveyard nearby if you wanna pay your respects. I'm sure she'd love to hear from you. I didn't do anything to her, and you know it. Funny, because there was only one person holding the knife that killed her, and it wasn't the boogeyman. [NOAH] Hey, hey, hey, forget it. They're not worth the aggravation. You don't know what it's like. Maybe not, but my bitch meter is pretty reliable. Anything I can do? [SIGHS] Is swatting Violet an option? Maybe an anonymous noise complaint? Actually, I could use a favor. OK. Can you give me photos of Steven's body? Why? Call it a hunch. We already know what happened. You know what the witness said. My dad would have my badge. [OLIVIA] It's important. I won't say anything to anybody. I swear. Hello, Jill. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [DOOR CREAKS] [SCREAMING] Let her go! Let her go! - [GUN COCKS] - [GASPS] Mrs. Hutchinson. The next-door neighbor called and said she thought someone was trying to break into my house. I'm so... I'm sorry. I didn't... I thought the place was empty. Haven't you done enough already? I know what you're thinking, and you have to believe me. I didn't hurt Jill. I heard all about the evil ghost man or whatever you said it was. I'm here to find the answers. You may have convinced everybody else that you're crazy, but I know exactly what you are. Hear that? That is the sound of karma. I'd leave before they get here, if I were you. [SIREN BLARING IN DISTANCE] Did you just see that? [WIND CHIMES DINGING] [EXHALES] Thank you, Noah. That's not possible. [PHONE RINGING] [BEEP] - This is Noah. - [OLIVIA] Jill. Six years ago. The face, contorted body, it's the same. [EXHALES] What if he came back? Who? [OLIVIA]The Crooked Man. Olive, are you... The lyrics said, "Down your crooked paths, he follows." - [WOMAN] Here you go. - [OLIVIA]"Paths." Plural. What if he's coming after everyone who was in the house? [NOAH] Look, you wanted to see photos, I sent you photos. You want my advice? Drop it. One more favor. Can you look up the file on Jill? - Olive... - I just want to see if she had any broken bones too. I told you, Steven fell out a window. Just check. All right, I'll think about it, but I gotta run, OK? OK. Whoa. [BEEP] [WOMAN ON PA]Dr. Wilson, 1878. Dr. Wilson, 1878. [TV TURNS ON] Mrs. Larson? Oh. [PANTING] [SCREAMING] [MRS. HUTCHINSON] Help me! [GROANING] - [CROOKED MAN GROWLING] - [WHIMPERS] [MRS. HUTCHINSON COUGHS] [GROWLS] [GAGS] [GASPS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GASPS] Ah! [GROWLS] [WOMAN ON RADIO] Why are you digging up that old case? I ran into Olivia Shaw at the Sanderson funeral yesterday. She tell you how they found her standing over Jill's body? Covered in blood, holding the knife that matched the stab wounds? It says here the victim had multiple broken bones. You don't think that was relevant to bring up in court? Olivia pushed her down the stairs. Yeah. What about the intruder Olivia said she saw? We searched the property. We questioned all the neighbors on the block. No one saw anyone. You know, your sister was supposed to be there that night. Could've been her picture in that file. Do yourself a favor, son. Stay away from Olivia Shaw. Table four says they've been waiting five minutes for coffee. I'm on it, I'm on it. [SIGHS] Can you do me a favor and refill number four? OK, what can I get for... I just need five minutes. [CHARLOTTE] I don't think so. I came to warn you. I think the Crooked Man is back. I saw a picture of Steven's body. Whatever happened to him, it looked just like Jill. Violet says I'm not supposed to listen to you. Charlotte... She says you're dangerous and unstable. She's just trying to protect herself. Charlotte, do you really think I killed Jill? [WOMAN ON TV]Eastborough Police are investigating the tragic death of Grace Hutchinson. Our investigators say it initially looked like suicide. They are not ready to make that claim just yet. - Family and friends of Hutchinson... - [GASPS] ...say there is no way this career woman and mother would take her own life. Investigators say the tragic death of Hutchinson's teenage daughter... [CHARLOTTE] Olive, you're right. Everyone who was there that night is dying. Where did you get that? I just found it. It's targeting us, isn't it? We need to let everyone know. Toss your bike in the back. I'll drive. We need to talk. - I'm working. - Violet, Jill's mother died last night. Let me guess. The boogeyman did it? Kind of a coincidence, don't you think? All of this happening just as I get back into town? You're not actually listening to this, are you? Steven's body... it looked like just like what happened to Jill. Look at it! What did happen to Jill, Olive? You don't remember that night? What I remember was a stupid, childish game, and my best friend being found dead. Look, you don't think I get it. If I'm the girl who killed Jill, then none of this was your fault. But if I'm right, and the Crooked Man is back... What, Olivia? What do you suggest we do? Go into hiding because you think something you did six years ago has come back to kill us? Come on, you don't really believe this, do you? Tell me, have you seen or experienced anything strange lately? Does this conversation qualify? This is not a joke, Violet! No, I haven't. But if you're right, and if your little homecoming has somehow brought this thing back, then there's really only one answer, isn't there? Leave. I have to get back to work. Just... Just do me one favor, OK? - Please stay out of the dark. - Olive, let's go. It lives in the dark. Just make sure you're always in the light, no matter what! [CHARLOTTE] You're wasting your time. - No one's seen her in years. - I'll be right back. [EXHALES] Who is it? Olivia Shaw. Alice isn't here. Do you know when she'll be back? She doesn't want to see you. That's not what I asked. - I think you should go. - Please! It's really important that I speak to your daughter. [WOMAN] Go away! [SIGHS] That didn't work. [OLIVIA EXHALES] Wait. So the babysitter's the last one? Assuming we even know how to find her. Actually, that's an easy one. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [ALICE] Mother? Trust me. It's for your protection. [LOUD MUSIC PLAYING] [PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] - This is taking way too long. - I know. Come on. Excuse us, excuse me, sorry. Sorry. Gotta get through. Please, please, our friend is in danger. - [MAN] Go on in. - Thank you. [MAN] You're good. [CROWD CHEERING] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Mia Johanssen. [MAN] There she is!

It's all in your head. Hello! Come on! Anyone in there? Excuse me. You two can't take a hint. - Something's wrong. - Mia? She's just taking a break. We think she might be in trouble. You're not getting in there. You do it then. Please! Fine. You two wait here. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] No, no. [SNAPPING] [GASPS] [SCREAMS] No! No! No! [MIA SCREAMS] [GROWLING] [GUARD] Mia! Mia! Everything OK? Mia! Mia? Are you here? Jesus! [SIREN BLARING] I can't comment on whether it was a suicide or not 'cause I haven't seen the autopsy. [TYPING ON KEYBOARD] You know how long it took my dad to get off the case? - What are you doing? - Look at this. "Classmates of the two missing teens mentioned that the two had recently displayed a fascination for an Internet meme known as the Crooked Man." There's gotta be at least 50 stories here: Suicides, homicides, disappearances. "Crooked Man Uncovered?" The original site was taken down. But according to this, a lot of people had recited that rhyme. Uh-huh. I thought maybe there might be some information on how to stop this thing. Unfortunately, there's no contact information listed or anything. - I have an idea. Come on. - Where are we going? - The Crooked Man? - You've heard of it? Internet meme that kills people? So can you find whoever put up that website or not? All you have to do is put the domain into a Whois search, and you should get what you need. [TYPING ON KEYBOARD] Got a P.O. box in Leveritt. No name? Looks like whoever did this wanted their privacy. But that should be pretty easy for you to trace, right? I thought you said this was going to be hard. We're cyber forensics. We can do anything. All I have to do is go into the system, find out who registered the box, and... It's been abandoned for three years. [EXHALES] - Great. - So back to square one? Wait. What... What are you doing? Most computers automatically imprint their files with a level of metadata, such as who created them and where. Kinda like a fingerprint. So, for example, if the site has any photos, I can find out where the computer was that posted them. Thanks. - You can't leave now! - [VIOLET] Look, Olive... I'm sorry I told everyone you were crazy, and I'm sorry I didn't support you all those years ago, but I am not going to sit around and wait to die! This guy maybe will have some answers for us. Is that gonna help Jill or Jill's mom or Mia? All gassed up! Violet's not coming. What do you mean, she's not coming? We had a plan. What if you're wrong? What if you can't stop it? You think running will help? I do know staying here won't. Come with me. You don't need to be a part of this. Yes, I do. We've been hiding too long. - It's your funeral. - Violet... Violet. Be careful. Please? You too. [DOOR OPENS, DOOR CLOSES] - Alice! - [CHARLOTTE] Olive. What are you doing? Alice! - [OLIVIA SCREAMS] - [ALICE] Grab my hand! [WHIMPERING] - Olivia, what are you doing here? - I need to talk to you. You need to leave. It's not safe. Alice... what happened? Please go. Not until I talk to you first. It's important. These drawings... You can't just come in here and go through my stuff. - Alice! - It's private! Alice, you're not alone. I've seen them too. We're being warned. Look, there's a site I found. Dozens of cases just like ours. - The Crooked Man? - Yes. Noah had a friend at the police station track down whoever put the site up. If they've been doing all the research, then-then maybe they know how to stop it. It's too late. This is why I need you to come with me. - I can't. - Alice... Mother says never leave the house without her. People are dying! She says I'm safe here. Do you believe her? Alice... this could be our chance to finally fix what we did. We can make things right. I get carsick. We'll crack a window. Come on. [SQUEAKING] ♪ Caught a crooked mouse ♪ Olivia? You saw something, didn't you? Olivia? It's over here. Hello? Is anyone there? Anybody? [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] - [MAN] What are you doing here? - [ALL GASP] - Olivia. - How do you know my name? You're very lucky. Not many people have come face to face with the Crooked Man and survived. You know about that? Of course. That's why you're here, isn't it? To find someone who can give you all the answers. Let's start with what this thing is and where it came from. In the 1800s, a writer researching legends and folklore discovered dozens of different cultures in dozens of different languages, all referring to the same thing. He called it the Crooked Man. Imagine a death sentence that no mortal could escape, that no human law could pardon, the eternal, unstoppable force bringing certain death to anyone who dare summon it. It probably started as an tribal incantation. A curse. The words were translated and passed down through the ages, evolving with the times. Over the years, it was transcribed and studied. Part of it was even turned into a nursery rhyme. Eventually someone put it online. And with that, the proverbial Pandora's Box was out there. The Crooked Man now belonged to the world. You were the one that put it up on Creepyhollow. Funny thing about the Internet. You can take down content, but it never really goes away. By the time I realized what was happening, that... that the Crooked Man was real, it was too late. I tried to get back online to warn people. Four people in our town are dead! And not a minute goes by where I'm not tormented by what I did. I'm up in that sanctuary every day, praying for the souls of the people I killed. Now, ever since I came back... The Crooked Man returned. Why? When you left, somehow you... you paused the curse. But now that you're back, now that all who were marked have returned and reunited, it's like you never left. I tried to warn you. I tried to get you to leave before he returned. What are you talking about? - The rock. - That was you. But now it's too late. What if she left again? Too many people have died now. He's coming for you. There's no order, no rhyme, no reason. Where there's darkness, he will be there. But there has to be a way to stop him, right? You can't. He cannot be stopped. You cannot hide, and you cannot run. If you have been cursed by the Crooked Man, he will kill you eventually, no matter what. Keep it down! [DOOR CREAKS] [SNAPPING] [GLASS SHATTERS] [WHISPERING] Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done...

[EXHALES] No way. Classical fairy tales? - Ancient mythology? - Noah. Your dad said you'd be here. - What's wrong? - Can we go talk? Yeah, of course. Noah, what is it? Noah, how do you have this? Noah. I have to tell you something... about when we were kids. What? The night of the sleepover? The night Jill died? I was there. My sister was supposed to be there. I was on my way home from basketball practice, and I thought... I thought I'd swing by and give 'em a little scare, you know. But by the time I got there, I realized she wasn't there. It was too late. And then when the lights went off, I got so scared that I would be seen, so I left. I'm screwed, aren't I? Noah, I am so sorry. I had no idea. But it's gonna be OK now, right? Because you figured out where the website came from, so you're gonna make it stop. Not quite. That's encouraging. But I'm working on it. So I am screwed. Hey. We're gonna fix this, OK? I promise. Yeah. Noah, what is it? You really don't see that. [GROWLING] It's him, isn't it? What is he doing? He's trying to get us... but he can't. [CROOKED MAN GROWLING] It's the light. As long as we stay out of the dark, we should be OK. He's gone. Come on. I have an idea. "Only with this crooked song shall the Crooked Man yield." At first, I thought it was talking about the rhyme itself. Yeah? But what if it literally means "song"? What if this music box is the key to the whole thing? Milo said there was a writer in the 1800s who was doing research on old legends and found out about the Crooked Man. He found the music box, and he accidentally summoned the Crooked Man. If this box is out there, we might be able to stop this thing. All we have to do is find it. What is it? We have to turn around. Now. [TIRES SCREECHING] [PHONE RINGING] [NOAH] Anything? Voicemail. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [TIRES SCREECHING] - Hope we're not too late. - Come on! [SNAPPING] [CROOKED MAN GROWLING] [GROANS] [CROOKED MAN] See you soon, Olivia. [WOMAN ON RADIO] [MAN] She didn't do anything. Oh, I forgot. It's the boogeyman, right? Son, a word. Olivia and I have been together the whole time. [POLICE OFFICER] Five people are dead, Noah. She left three suicide notes. You saw the body. You think she did that to herself? Not exactly. Please tell me you're not drinking the fruit punch. - I know it sounds crazy. - You are a police officer. - [NOAH] I know what I saw! - OK. Here's what's gonna happen. - You're not listening. - You're gonna take her down - to the police station, OK? - You're gonna arrest her? I'm gonna come down there and talk to her as soon as I'm done here. Do you want me to have somebody else do this? [SIRENS BLARE] [NOAH] No. How could she have felt so helpless? I'm sorry. What are you doing? I have no choice. - [OLIVIA] Noah! - [NOAH] Don't make a scene. - You can't do this! - Just get in the car, please. This is 4-30. Suspect in custody. 10-7 to station. [MAN ON RADIO]Copy that, Noah. [OLIVIA CRYING] What are you doing? Noah! [KEYS CLANKING] Shh! We're alone now. We got about 20 minutes until my father realizes where we're going. I'm sorry. So where do we go now? Looks like a place a professor would live. [WOMAN]Well, it's always nice to meet some of dad's former students. He always spoke so highly of you and your mom. I thought, since we happened to be in the area, that we should pay our respects. Oh, you found Milo, I see. He was my dad's teaching assistant for years. Which... which class of his did you take again? World Culture and Mythology. Yeah. That was one of his favorites. [LAUGHS] - Sugar? - No, thank you. He always would tell the most interesting stories. He would make you feel like you were right in the middle of it all. It must've been amazing, growing up with a father like that, all the stories he must have had. To tell you the truth, yeah, he saved most of that for his students. Hmm. I can only imagine all the things he must have left behind. I heard he had quite the collection. You want to see it? - [OLIVIA] Huh. - [NOAH] Whoa. [OLIVIA] Look at all this stuff. [SIGHS] Some of these items must be pretty valuable. [WOMAN] Yeah, well, you can't put a price on your father's memory. [OLIVIA] I imagine not. That was one of his more recent finds. I remember him talking about it. May I? Who are you? - We told you. - No. First of all, what, were you 12 years old when he still taught that class? And second of all, he never would've spoken very highly of me. Certainly not my mother, so do you wanna tell me what you're really doing here? Have you heard the rhyme about the Crooked Man? [SCOFFS] Of course. My father wrote a book about the author. We believe it's real. After your father died, Milo posted the means to summon him online. Six people have died, and unless we can figure out how to undo our mistake, there will be more. We believe this box might be the only way to stop it. I'm gonna show you something. WANTED BY POLICE NOAH HARRIS OLIVIA SHAW Something that I have not shown anyone. Not the police. But when I... when I found my father's body in the classroom... he had this. We can end it. For good. We just need to borrow the box. Please. You get that son of a bitch. [WOMAN ON TV]Noah Harris' black SUV was reportedly seen early this morning heading north. Harris and Olivia Shaw are being sought by police in connection with last night's brutal slaying that... I always knew she was trouble. [CELL PHONE CHIMES] I always said it. Hey! Not at the dinner table. Dear Lord, bless this food that we are about to eat and all that it provides. - Amen. - [ALICE] Amen. [THUNDER CRACKING] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Looks like a storm is coming in. [CLEARS THROAT] Now... where were we? - I am going to check the breakers. - No! I mean... I'll come with you. I should get some candles. You know, maybe it's-it's the whole block. Maybe. There's nothing there. There's nothing there. [SWITCH CLICKS] Mother? - Alice? - Mother, I can't open the door! Alice! [ALICE] Mother? [WHIMPERING] Mother, are you OK? I'm scared! Ow! [AIR HISSING] Mother? Is that you? [CROOKED MAN GROWLING] [GAGGING] [GRUNTS] [COUGHS] [COUGHS] [GROWLING] How 'bout a light? [MONITORS BEEPING] I should've been there. No, you can't blame yourself. [OLIVIA] For six years, her mother tried everything she could, and probably more than she should, to keep Alice safe. Hey, she's alive. How many people have died because of me? Jill, Steven, Mia, Charlotte, Violet. You're the one that's trying to save them. He called my name. What are you talking about? Back at the house, when I touched the music box, he called my name. And it wasn't the first time. This is all my fault. All of this. - He's taunting me. - No, no, no, you can't think like that. No, I killed them, Noah. I killed all of them! [SHUSHING] You think she can hear me? She's in a coma because of me. Don't you understand? Because of me! [NOAH] Come on, let's go. - Don't you ever turn the light off! Ever! - She's just a little tired. Excuse us. I'm the one who started it. I'm the one who needs to end it. How? [EXHALES] The music box, it showed me something. A crooked house. I think that's where we have to find him. Did it show you where it was? Uh... All I saw were woods. Think. Were there any specific characteristics or landmarks? Anything specific? Just a clearing. But... But I did notice two large rocks and giant pine tree. As if that even helps. Actually, it does. - Come here. Come here. - What are you doing? [MAN ON RADIO] Let's go, let's go. [NOAH] I was a cub scout when I was a kid. One day my troop went for a hike through this park. We found this clearing and two rocks. Just like your vision. [CAR ENGINE STOPS] You ready? - [OLIVIA] For Alice. - [NOAH] For Alice. We're close. We're here. This is exactly what I remember. The rocks, the trees. [EXHALES] And the house was somewhere... right... [RUMBLING] - Did you see... - [NOAH] No. That house was not there a minute ago. So what happens now? We kill the Crooked Man. [CREAKING] I'll go check the upstairs. Be careful. [WHISPERS ] [VOICE HEARD WHISPERING] [ANIMAL SCREECHING] [GRUNTS] [ANIMAL CONTINUES TO SCREECH] [WHIMPERS] [NOAH] Olive! Oh, God. You all right?
