Where's that fourth guy disappeared to? Take it easy, Hugo. Christ, Vitali, they're getting younger every day. I didn't come here to kill kids. If you don't, they won't spare you. Maybe that would suit me just fine. Really. Come on, Hugo. They need us here. But they're just kids! What the fuck am I doing here, Vitali? God only knows. God would never let things get this fucked up. Don't try to blame all mankind's fuck ups on God. But tell me... why a young man from a wealthy family like yours came here to fight? Because it's exciting to join an outfit like Liberty Bells. Fighting for freedom all over the world, what a great cause. But once you're in it, you realize it's another story. Go get some sleep, you'll feel better. I'll never get back to sleep. No! Excuse me. Excuse me. I'd like to speak to Inspector Anita Staro. Inspector Staro? She's not here yet. It's too early. Why do you want to see her? It's personal. Good morning. Do you want a cup of coffee, or tea? No, thank you. So, since you know me, how come you're in here so early? - Don't you have school today? - Yes. Well, what brought you here? I want to report a murder. You want to report a murder? - You saw someone commit a murder? - No. - It was my mother. - She saw something? Did something happen to her? You have to tell me if you want me to help. No. My mother... she kills people. - What's your name? - Alice. Alice. You understand what you're saying, right? Right? May I? It's all on this. She's killing my nanny. I saw it. It's horrible. My mother said she's gone away, but I know that Sonya would never leave without saying goodbye to me. My mother found out that Sonya was getting postcards... - that my dad was sending to me. - Where did you find this? In the basement, at home. It's true, I swear. Hmm, calm down. What I'll do is... I'll go take a look at this, and I'll be right back. Another detective will take care of you. All right? Help! Leave me alone! Please, help! Please! How dare you lie to me? Nobody lies to me. This is appalling. - How can anybody be so sick? - Hold it. Don't get carried away. These days you can manipulate images with computers. You can make them say anything you want. Are you kidding? I'll never forget what I saw. Jesus Christ! Okay. Have that movie analyzed by experts. Check on the nanny's alleged disappearance. And get that kid to a psychologist. That's all we can do. But we've got enough to launch a formal investigation. - We have to search the mother's house. - Forget it. Leave the kid's mother out of it. Anyway, she's untouchable. Untouchable? What do you mean? We've got the evidence. That's evidence? They're all wearing masks. It would never stand up in court. You take care of the kid. I'll deal with the rest. Good morning. Detective Staro. May I come in, please? I have a few questions for Mrs. Eva Kristensen. Sorry to disappoint you, but she won't be back for quite some time. - May I ask why? - She's on vacation. I was told that the police would come, and that I should be fully cooperative. How nice. So, may I visit the basement? I presume you have done your homework, and that you have a warrant? Of course. - What's in here? - Nothing. You searched the premises without a warrant. Are you crazy? Of course, you didn't realize that that man was one of Mrs. Kristensen's lawyers. Well, he didn't introduce himself. That wasn't very smart of you. Now they're claiming we're handling their client, we're fabricating evidence, and so on. I don't think you realize who Eva Kristensen is. She's not a pushover like the others. You and I mean nothing to her. Don't ever forget that. No one has seen the nanny, Sonya, for weeks. She just vanished into thin air. Maybe she just went back home to her country. We can't turn Alice over to her mother's lawyers. She's under our protection, she's a witness in a murder investigation. And we have every right to do this. Only until tomorrow morning. These lawyers, Staro, they know their stuff. They are really rough on us. Don't push your luck. Hmm... Staro... Eva Kristensen is here. She wants to talk to you. - Anita Staro. - Eva Kristensen. - Well? - Well. I have to talk to you, even though my lawyers advised against it. They also told me what my daughter alleges that I've done. I'd advise you to verify these charges very, very carefully. I'd like to see Alice, talk it over with her. I'm sure we can sort this matter out. I'm afraid that's not possible. You have no right to take my daughter away from me. I will not allow it. Do you know where her nanny is? Where is Sonya? Absolutely no idea. These girls disappear at the drop of a hat. They find a new boyfriend, they get homesick, or... whatever. You know that. Well, it seems that Sonya was acting as a go-between with her father. With Steven Travis? Alice's father? - This is some kind of joke? - I don't think so. Well, I'm afraid it must be, Inspector. Because Alice's father, my ex-husband, drowned at sea on his yacht in Portugal three years ago. So you see? The poor thing has been seeing a psychoanalyst ever since his death. She... she says a lot of things. She has a very vivid imagination. And she also loves being the center of attention. Then what are we supposed to make of the evidence your daughter brought us this morning? Well, it doesn't prove anything, does it? There are a lot of people out to get me, Inspector. My daughter is being used. And I believe that she's using you in this fabrication about her father. Now I'd like to see her, please. Because you have no right to hold her against my wishes. Excuse me. This woman is a monster. She makes me sick. She won't anymore, Staro. You're off the case. - What? But... - I'm sorry, Anita. Searching her premises without a warrant didn't go over too well with the brass. Please. You're mine. What are you doing here? We're waiting for a car to take her to the psychologist. Lucas' orders. Do you mind if I have a word with her? - No, go ahead. - Thanks a lot. Wake up, sleepyhead. Alice... Hey. Come with me, to my office. - Is that your daughter? - No, it's me. What did you find at the house? Nothing. Nothing. She moved everything, right? She managed to convince everyone that I'm crazy, but I know I'm not. I know everything about her. And I know she killed Sonya. Do you believe me? Yes, Alice. I believe you. Are you going to turn me over to my mother? - No, Alice, it's going to be okay. - No, it won't. She'll never forgive me. Alice... I'll do everything I can to help you. Trust me. Trust me. The car's here. Time to go. No, babe, don't worry about it, okay? I promise you I'm going to sort it all out. It'll be all right. I'll call you later. Okay, bye. Problems? - She'll be here in five minutes. - And the girl? She wants to go through official channels, so we wait. That's all we ever fucking do, wait, wait and wait! Give me just five minutes and I'll get that little bitch. She wants us to wait, so we'll wait. Sure. Eva tells her little doggie to wait, so he waits. - Good little doggie. - I'm gonna knock you out now. In your dreams, only in your dreams. Little doggie's really getting gutsy. Go fuck yourself... Stop fucking about. We're in front of a police station. Behave. How many times do I have to tell you not to smoke in the fucking car? I'm allergic to it. Get out! - Where's the girl? - She's gone to the bathroom. Alone? You let her go alone? - Yeah. - Are you crazy? Alice, you okay? Alice? She took off. Quick, she might still be in the building! Come on! Shit. Alice! Alice! The girl was just there, man! What's up, mate? Alice, she's fucking split. Quick! Where are the keys? I'll meet you on the other side! Don't even you two cunts think about it! Come on, come on, come on, come on. Koesler, I'm checking the canal area. What the fuck?! She's walking over the bridge. Come on, get faster over here! What bridge? I can't see her. There she is. Alice! Alice! Alice! I lost her. She got away. Okay. Pardon. Are they looking for you? Fuck! Here they go! Get out of my fucking way, you cunt! Get out of the way! The plate's number's OM 107. - What's your name? - Alice. I'm Hugo. Did you really have to wash your car right now? If you want to hide a car, you look for a place with lots of cars. And if you want to lose someone who's after you, just sit still. Are you a cop? No, I'm not. Then... why do you talk like one? - And you have a gun - Hey, I'll ask the questions. What have you gotten yourself into? Tell me. That guy on the street, you know him well? Yes. - He works for my mother. - He works for your mother? Where do you want to go? - Portugal. - Portugal?! What for? To see my dad. Listen, mister, I'm sorry to bother you like this. Just drop me at the train station. There? I'm sure they're already waiting for you. Look, I'm heading out of town to attend a meeting. I'll drop you off further along the road, okay? Yes, I have a question for you. - When do the windmills bloom? - In August. - In August? - Hundreds of windmills bloom in August. You don't talk much. Neither do you. What do you want to be when you grow up? - An astronaut. - An astronaut? Why? Because you're alone, out in space, and you can see the Earth from way up there. I've seen pictures, it's the most beautiful thing in the world. Yeah, I guess. You like being alone? I took me a while to get used to it. Now I really like it. It's better than being with people. Everything they touch turns rotten. They're like a virus. Well, at least we agree on that. You look sad. Are you sad? I need a break. "Vacation" is a word I haven't used in a long time. Alice... do exactly as I tell you. - What? - Don't look around, go to the bathroom. - Me? No. - Yes you do. Alice... Alice. Okay, it's time to go. Hand over the girl, asshole. You don't stand a chance. We'll see. Right now don't move and everything will be all right. Don't brag, sweetheart. You're no killer. - I can see it in your eyes. - Wanna bet? You don't have the guts to pull the trigger. You fucking twat! What happened? Where are they? Where are they? I can't move my feet... I didn't think he'll... Get up! And don't get any fucking blood on my suit. Get down. Stay down and don't move. - You look good. - You too. - Been on holiday? - I'm on holiday all year round. I'm out, Vitali, for good. Not that again. Stop talking about quitting. We don't know what the word "quit" means. Yes, you do. It means giving up all that crap. No more guns, no more wars, no more blood. Disappearing- Did Harry say anything? He says it's out of the question. Nobody quits Liberty Bells. Unless it is to go to meet its maker. I'll come to terms with it. I mean... If you're tired of fighting, at least help us out. More people are joining us every day. Even if they don't know why they want to fight in the first place, we teach them what freedom means. Like Spain in 1936, people came from all over the world to fight fascism. I'm too old for that bullshit, Vitali. I want to forget. Forget. Did you come all this way just to chit chat about your scruples? At first, that was the only reason. But I have another problem to solve. And I need you. Oh, for fuck's sake. Are you crazy? Some creeps with guns are after her, mean bastards sent by her mother, and apparently her mother is no angel either. - What would you do? - Dump her on the roadside, that's what! Hi. You... go inside, turn on the TV, and shut the fuck up, okay? He's a priest? Priests don't talk that way. Move! And I mean now! You idiot, Koesler! First you lose her at the house, then at the police station. What the fuck am I paying you for! Are you going south like I told you to? Good. I think I know where she's going. You waste a guy and then show up here with her? Have you forgotten everything you've learned? What if they link this to our organization? She said she already went to the police and they wanted to turn her back to her mother. And you believed her? I need new IDs and a new car. In 24 hours I can be in Portugal. Another 24 hours to find her father, I'll can be back in Paris in four days, tops. I'll ask Harry. You go outside and gaze at the stars. Come on, Miss Gagarin. Who's Harry? Tell me. He runs our outfit. He's like our guardian angel. What's that bell? Some kind of badge? What you don't know won't hurt you. Hi, Hugo. Good to see you. So, you playing babysitter? Here's some quick research for you. Do you recognize your pint-sized damsel in distress? Her mother, Eva Kristensen, is one of the wealthiest women in the world. She owns more than 200 legit companies. Very well connected politically, and has all the protection she needs. It didn't take a whole lot of surfing to find out that some of her companies are involved in arms dealing, like you and me. It could spell trouble for Liberty Bells if she connects you to us, right? She won't, Artie. I promise. Is the gas station incident making any waves? Not yet. We'll help you with the logistics, but for the rest, you're on your own. - Roger. Over and out. - This is not goodbye, Hugo. We're not through, you and me. I'm sure of that. Bon chance. I'll check everything you need by tomorrow morning. Thanks. - Time to go to bed, Alice. - Wait. - Toothbrush, toothpaste. - Thanks. - Still can't get it out of your mind? - What? You know what. Forget it. It was an accident. Killing an eight-year-old boy instead of a soldier isn't exactly an accident. Every minute, every second of the day, that kid's face is still staring at me. You've been a naughty girl. Haven't you, Alice? Little you know how much that upsets me. You've been a very, very... naughty... girl. Hugo! Hugo! Hugo! Hugo! - What's wrong? - Nothing. Come on, sit down. You're here so early. You been there all night? Do you mind? It's that girl, you know. The report just came in confirming the murder of Sonya Riza. That DVD hadn't been tampered with. Of course we haven't found her body. But even that wouldn't prove Ms. Kristensen was involved. Christ. I knew it. It all adds up. She was here, we had her. - Can we talk with her? - No, we can't. We know she was at the airport a couple hours ago. Are you gonna sit still through all this? We got another report about a shooting in a gas station. A man and a little girl got away. The girl's description fits Alice Kristensen's. And where were they going? South. It looks like Eva Kristensen also caught a flight to Portugal. Why don't you grab the first plane for Lisbon? You'll be on unofficial business. You could try to find the kid before her mother does. I'm sorry, but... I can't. Why not? Because... I'm too emotional, and... I think I'd better go back to Italy. You ever thought of having kids yourself? What does that have to do with anything? I've got two. Kids are so damn fragile. Alice trusts you. You're the only one of us she'll listen to. If you don't go, nobody will. So... are you catching that damn plane or not? Yeah. - Here are your new French passports. - Merci, Mon Père. Look in the back, everything a father and daughter need to go on a holiday. You don't know much about kids. I'm way too old for this. The rest of the equipment... in the glove compartment there are maps with three routes with safe houses. If you need anything else, we have drop-off boxes in Portugal. Thanks for everything, Vitali. I hope to see you as late as possible. The Lord moves in mysterious ways. - Thank you. - Don't thank me, little lady. Thank Harry and Hugo. If it was up to me, I wouldn't have lifted a finger. - It wasn't my fault! - Yes it was! Such a good job that I've sent for reinforcements, isn't it? Alice's escape wasn't a lucky break. Don't you get it? This is Travis' doing. It's gotta be him. The body was never found. And if he's alive, he's gonna do everything in his power to get her back. He doesn't have the guts to do it. He obviously hired a pro to do it. I should have strangled him before it was too late! - Sorvan, Koesler. You know each other? - Yeah. Good, because you two are now going to be working together. Under the supervision of Colonel Vondt. I took the liberty of asking for his help, and he kindly obliged. I understand, Eva. Whatever you say. Sorry to butt in, but you asked me to check Travis' old friends. We found this guy Kazinopolis. Shall I start on him right away, or do I wait for Colonel Vondt? No. Go ahead. Make him talk. And Sorvan, don't forget the DV Cam. I'd like to check out Travis' old villa in Comporta, it might be worth the lead. No need. I already checked. Can I go? From the start I had a hunch about that place. More like female intuition? Two of my men are already there. And they don't look like pussycats. - Precisely. - Sorvan... let him handle it. You don't need him along to have some fun and games with the Greek guy. He's screwed up once too often. I want your men to deal with it. - Understand? - Understand. And make sure there's no trace of the body. My pleasure, Ms. Kristensen. How about some music? Look in there. Portugal isn't far now. Maybe you should tell me a little bit more about your father. Like how come you and him don't have the same family name. I don't know. Yeah? How can you listen to that? You really like that old stuff? It's nothing to be ashamed of. Jimi Hendrix wrote the best song ever about war, "Machine Gun." I mean... this stuffs for dinosaurs. Did I offend you? Not at all. You're right about the music. Anyway, within 24 hours at most we'll be saying goodbye. The less we know about each other, the better. It has to do with my father. He made me promise, and I did, never to tell anyone what he told me in his letters. I feel like I'm on vacation. I haven't felt this free in years. Are you married? You have kids? I'm sorry to interrupt your vacation, Little Miss Hip, but tonight we're in Portugal. What do we do next? It's a village called Comporta, by the sea. "The Little Red Siren." My dad called me that because when I sunbathe, I get red as a lobster. Hey, don't read it! That's private. - Inspector Staro? - Yeah. Detective Oliveira. - Nice flight? - Yeah, yeah. I'm a lucky guy to get teamed up with such a beautiful partner. - Have you located Eva Kristensen? - Yeah, but you know... everyone knows her around here. She's at the Casa Azul. Have you checked out Travis' old friends? We've located an old shack where he used to live. - Did you find anything there? - I was about to suggest going there. - All right? - Yeah. How about some lunch first? Just kidding. Yeah? Okay. Yeah? What did you say? We'll check it out. Change of program. A Greek called Kazinopolis was found dead at his beach house an hour ago. He was on our list of people connected to Travis. - You wanted to go to his old place? - Of course not. Oh, I tend to doze off if I drive on an empty stomach. Would you mind talking to me? Do I have to sing to you, too? I love women who can hold their own with men. - Maybe I'll make you change your mind. - Yeah. This way. I hope you had a good flight, Vondt. Your men would go to hell and back for you. They're like orphans if they're not in an army, and if they don't have a war to fight. I'm like a father to them. We're a tight family. Well, lucky for you. Because I'm sick of family ties. Especially dead ex-husbands trying to kidnap my daughter. Don't worry. You'll soon have your daughter back. I'm going to star them in a brand-new blood curdling movie. Well, good. Now let's mix business with a little pleasure. Because I've heard you've come up with some new techniques since our last operation in the Middle East. Some little improvements, which I'm sure you'll appreciate. Well, you know how impatient I am and you've never let me down. And talking of movies, Sorvan went to interrogate a Greek friend of Travis'. Would you like to see the tape? Where's Travis? Where is Travis? Tell me now, you filthy Greek. Where is Travis? Speak up! Son of a bitch! Where's Travis? Jesus. They really did a job on him. Look at this mess. Junkies. They'll do anything for a fix. It was a drug dealer? He was convicted a few years ago. - What was his connection to Travis? - Drugs. You didn't know Travis was a junkie? Did he have a job? Yeah, freelance skipper. But it seems that recently he was more into building boats. Oh, man! Junkies didn't kill him. The wounds are too sophisticated, and weren't meant to kill him. At least not right away. They did everything they could to make his agony last for as long as possible. Oh shit! - Still want to go and have lunch? - No, no thanks. Great. So, let's take a good look at this place, shall we? Stay in the car. Don't get out whatever happens. Why? You don't know what my dad looks like. Don't worry. First let me make sure the coast is clear. Which house is it? The last one. Way over there, the red one. No! - You're a killer! - Calm down, will you? Everything is going to be okay. Manta... Manta... these are the blueprints for a sailboat. Otherwise... just... files with a record of every penny he's ever spent. - This guy is a bloody accountant? - Nothing any better over here. Thousands of restaurant checks... Is that the girl? Yeah. It will take weeks to sift through all this crap. Yeah. And we only have a few hours. Let's go to Travis' house. Have a heart. It's over an hour's drive, and it's getting dark, we won't be able to see anything. There's a nice pousada close by. We'll go to Travis' place first thing in the morning, I promise. Follow me, señora, and discover the joys of Portuguese hospitality. - Do I have any choice? - No. There's nothing else around. - But you'll love it. - Okay, let's go. Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait. You should leave me here. If my mother catches you... she'll kill you. I'm delivering you to your father, okay? I promised, and I keep my promises. Thanks, Hugo. Don't you ever pull a thing like that again. I promise. Now let's find a nice, quiet place to rest for a while. I need to think. - Okay? - Okay. Gooooaalll! Excuse me. Do you have a vacancy? The hotel is empty, if you want you can try out all our rooms. It's okay, I just need a room for the night, please. With twin beds. Do you have a preference for any special number? I couldn't care less. Okay. May I have your passports? - Hello? - Eva? Koesler. Surprised to hear my voice? Well, a little, yes. How did you get away from Sorvan's men? Well, I have your daughter's new babysitter to thank for that. He's a real pro. He took them out. - So? - So... I know where that man and Alice are hiding. But I'm not going to tell you where it is. Oh, come on, you know you can trust me. Two rooms, please. Adjacent rooms. Can I have your passports, please? Will this do? - Eight. - Seven. Is it too late to get a bite to eat? Obrigado. Welcome to Portugal. It's fine, then. I'm dead tired. And tomorrow... - we have a tough day, right? - Right. We have a tough day... - but... - Good night. Yes, umm... - So... - So... It's too early to turn in. That's right. Find yourself a disco then. - You're the tour guide here. - Yeah, I know... - Good night. - But... Stay in those clothes, Alice. Be ready to move. Good night, Hugo. Good night, Alice. I found this in the car. .556... shit! That complicates things. Vondt? We have a little problem. The target is heavily armed. Please confirm it's still a go operation. You have authority to proceed. I repeat, authority to proceed confirmed. I don't remember asking for room service. I couldn't find a disco... Thanks so much. Put it on my tab. Okay. Thank you. The target is in room 13. Proceed to the rooms. Be careful. Two men dead. He's picking us off like fish in a barrel. What are your orders? Okay, let me check. - Hello? - Eva, it's getting complicated. It'll be bloodier than we thought. I don't care. Give me my daughter back now. Storm the position by any means necessary. He's got to have an infrared sight. This is hell! We need to pull out. We're being massacred. What's going on? Answer me, Sorvan! Sorvan! I'll kill that piece of shit! You hear me? I'm gonna blast you! Sorvan. Later. We overdid it. Okay? Come on. Colonel. Are you okay? Hey, answer me! Are you okay? Come on, come on. Take this, take it. Freeze! Drop your gun. I said, drop your gun! Miss Staro? Anita! - Alice? - Hugo! Don't shoot her. She's a friend. You're... you're under... It's only a ﬂesh wound. The slug didn't hit the bone or the artery. Go on. It's going to sting. You'll need at least two stitches. I'll give you a shot. How did they find us at the hotel? - They must have followed you. - Or you. - I'd never seen such a bloodbath. - Well, I have. Those guys are soldiers... real pros. She's so brave. I almost forgot she's only a child. Who are you? Let's just say I won't answer that question. - And what's in it for you? - What do you mean? I mean, taking care of her, what you did... I guess you're not a fucking babysitter, are you? One doesn't always needs a motive. She hid in my car. Her mother's goons were after her... I got caught up in it, that's all. For once Lady Luck had a decent job. Let's assume you're an angel then. What about that guy who was gunned down at the gas station in France? What do you mean? Yeah, that's personal. What are you going to do now? Deliver the girl to her father, that's all. Well, there's one thing she obviously didn't tell you. Her father died three years ago. That's not true. You're just making that up so I'll let you take her away - without putting up a fight. - No. Don't get mad, but I think she made a fool of you. Of course she didn't mean no harm. She really believes her father is still alive. - I've seen the postcards he sends her. - Maybe he sent them before he died. You know, it's really tough taking care of a kid like that. I don't think it's really your turf. The best thing for her is that you turn her over to me. We have enough on the mother to keep her out of the custody. I promise you. - Promises. I don't know that word. - Well, too bad. Think about it. But don't leave while I'm asleep. You promise... I mean, you swear? Go to sleep. That guy had it all set up... fake passports... heavy artillery. He's a very clever tactician and a very good soldier. I wish he'd been on our side. You sound like you want to pin a medal on him and he killed most of your men. I respect soldiers who fight bravely... Oh, please! Let's just cut the mutual admiration bullshit, shall we? And talk about how to get my daughter back, because I thought that was supposed to be your job! The shootout at the hotel won't go unnoticed. The police might link it to your presence here. You better go for a cruise on the high seas until this blows over. I can't leave Alice here. Let's check it later. There are more important matters to deal with. You can't endanger your whole organization for that kid. You have to concentrate on preserving whats essential. This is hard for me to explain, but... there is nothing more essential to me than that kid. She's a part of me, Colonel, we're made from the same flesh. I breathe the same air as her. I only live for her. I know you can't understand... - I understand. - No, you don't. But it doesn't matter. You leave, I won't hold it against you, I promise. But I can't. I suggested you should leave. I have a score to settle with that guy, believe me. Thank you. Alice? What the fuck? - What? - Alice is gone. She double-crossed us. Se went to find her father alone. She's been taking both of us for a ride from the start. One guy there saw a little girl waiting for the bus. - Where was she headed? - Galeão, Salamanca... The guy doesn't know, he just saw her waiting. Shit. Salamanca is 50 miles from here and Galeão's even further. We might as well flip a coin. Salamanca. Wait... wait! Look. I found this picture at the house of Travis' friend. You see? On the back somebody wrote the year and the name of the place it was taken. E-A-O. It's Galeão. Dad? Alice! I can't believe it! Daddy! I really missed you! How touching. But someone's missing from the family reunion. I've got a quick phone call to make. Eva, shut your fucking mouth and listen. I've got a surprise for you. Excuse me, we're looking for a friend, Stephen Travis. Is he around? - Never heard of him. - It's important, about his daughter. I'm sorry. I don't know any Stephen Travis around here. I know she's here. "The Red Siren." Hey! Who painted that? O'Connell. That's his name. You might find him at the boatyard over there, by the beach. He's a weirdo, you'll see. Anybody home? - What do you want? - Mr. O'Connell? What's this about? We saw your paintings at the bar and my wife thinks they're amazing. We'd like to buy some. A real family gathering! Ow! Bitch! Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt. Fuckface, put the gun down on the ground now, slowly. There you go. Kick it over the side. Thank you. Now, everybody get in there. - Go on, move! - You shouldn't... I shouldn't what? Fucking... And you two, move! Enjoy the party. Eva... I got 'em. They're right here... He's going to hell, poor bastard. She's gonna eat him alive, just as she did me. You worked for her too? Not in front of Alice. It's okay, Dad. I worked on a boat, one of those huge cruise ships. That's where I met your mother. It was love at first sight. I fell head over heels. So we got married, then you arrived. It was fantastic. But then... I didn't know. It all went wrong. Your mother got hooked on power and violence. The house looked like a whorehouse, they filmed orgies, it was sordid. I wanted to get out of there. But Eva became suspicious. She told the police I was a drug dealer. I was no dealer, but... they searched my boat and they happened to find a big stash. So they put me away, for two years. Your mother divorced me and... changed your family name. When I got out, I disappeared, I didn't trust her. I made it look like my boat had sank. But I didn't stop thinking of you, Alice. I had to get you out. A friend of mine helped me to put my life back together. And then I started building this boat, "La Manta", somewhere for you and I to be... together, you know? To fight. - The friend was Kazinopolis? - Yes. - He's dead. - Oh, no. I'm sorry. Eva. Hey, baby. Eva, I missed you. You look gorgeous. Did you miss me? - Where is she? - Down there. Well, how nice to see you all again. Especially you, Travis. Back from the dead no less. What a dump. I see you're still a pathetic slob. All the more disappointing that you would betray me for this, Alice. - The Portuguese police will... - Don't insult my intelligence! You will all stay here and Alice is going to leave with me. Do you understand? Come on, Alice. It's time to go home now. Come on, come to Mommy, sweetheart. If you love her, you leave her with me. Oh, really? But I've got big plans for her. Haven't I? She's going to take over for me and go even further, isn't that right? Because you're mine, all mine. Come on, Alice. You don't want me to do anything to anybody here, do you? You see, Miss Staro, it sometimes takes a little time, but I always get what I want. Leave her with me! Alice! You have some house cleaning to do. Come on, quick! You know what a gypsy barbecue is? Douse it. Alice! Run! Alice, stop pulling, come on! Ahh! I know you. Was it in Gorazde or Srebrenica? I forget. You're brave. I'll make it fast for you. What are they doing? They're sorting a few details. They'll join us later. Come on! - But you said... - It doesn't matter what I said, Alice! Sometimes I find it difficult to believe you're actually my daughter. Come on! You're a monster. Alice, it's not your fault. I let your mind to get corrupted by all those... inferior people. But don't worry, darling. That's going to change now. - No, don't do this. - Yes, now come on. - No! - Stop it! We don't have time! - You're going to kill them! - Come on! Shut up! Get in the car! I hate you! I hate you! Oh, really, you hate me? All right then... if you hate me so much, Alice, then kill me. Come on. You're a big girl now. Come on... kill me. Oh, my darling. I'm so delighted to see you've got the killer instinct in you. Can you feel the excitement? Can you taste the blood rising in your head? Come on, shoot me. Shoot Mommy. Shoot me, Alice. Oh my sweetheart. You see, only a select few have the true killer instinct in them. But don't worry, 'cause you'll have it one day, I promise. Now give me the gun. Come on, give me the gun! Give... Alice! Alice! - Come on, get the hell out of here! - Let's take him, he's the only witness! - No, we have to find Alice! - I'll take care of him, go get Alice! Go! Go! Alice. Now, come here. Give me the gun, Alice. No, Alice! No! She won't forget. She'll be all right. I know who you were talking about. If the weather stays like this, we're going to sail next week. - Yeah? - Yeah. I think I'm going to stay here for awhile. As a matter of fact, I'm resigning from the police. Alice would like you to come with us. Come with us. We'll see.
