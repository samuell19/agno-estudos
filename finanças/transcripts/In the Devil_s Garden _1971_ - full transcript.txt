Class is over. Janet and Mary can clean up today. And don't forget to wash your brushes! - Come on, hurry up. - I'll only be a second. Bye! - Bye, see you in the morning. - Bye. - Goodbye. - Bye. Give her my love! Not likely! Never... believe her... - Good morning, Doctor. - Good morning. Good of you to come. I hope this doesn't take too long. I'm due at the hospital. Well... Oh, no - not again. Give us your first impression, Doctor. If you bring me in every time you bring in some tramp... This isn't any old tramp, Doctor. This fellow was seen near Devil's End at the time the Hurst girl was attacked. What do you know about him? Intelligence subnormal. No alibi... We are holding him for breaking and entering. 12 counts. All houses where a woman lives alone. He hides and watches them undress. - He just watches? - Yes. - When was his last offense? - Thursday night. Well, keep looking. Why? Don't you suspect him? Peeping Toms want sex with no contact. Rape is on the other end of the scale. Sex appetites sometimes change. Yes, but not backwards. He's not going to rape a girl, and then go back to peeping in keyholes. We're clutching at straws. It's been two months with no leads. We have to get him. Next time, it could be murder. - How's the girl? Still the same? - Yes. You should look for a young man, who lives at home with no father and a domineering mother. Or someone older - a psychotic who lives alone with no one to observe them. Or the middle-aged type. Someone who hangs around playgrounds... - Or an inhibited family man. - Like this Peeping Tom? Or like you maybe. I don't know. - Tell me what you know. - Good morning. - Come on! - Excuse me. Thank you, Doctor. Keep me informed about the Hurst girl. Chief, I know you're busy but who is it? - Just give me his name. - False alarm. - That's all I'm telling you. - The boys are betting on your promotion. - Who tipped you off? - I'll never tell. - Good morning, Doctor. - Good morning. There you are! Golfing good? How are the greens? - I had to go to the Police Station. - I wondered what delayed you. - They wanted me opinion on a suspect. - A suspect? For the Hurst case? - Likely suspect? - No. - How is the girl doing? - No change. That's a shame, poor kid. Keep trying. Hello, Tessa. You are early today. Where's your mother? Gone shopping? We are going to get wet. It's is starting to rain. Shall we join the others on the terrace? Come on. I know what you would like - to play with your old friends again. Would you like that? Do you mind if we join you? Thanks. Tessa, let's see if you are ready yet. Here it comes... Shall we try again? Leave your paintings where they are and we will have the criticism tomorrow. Don't forget to wash you brushes! Janet... Wipe your mouth! - But Mrs. Sanford... - Wipe it! I don't care what you do at home, but you cannot wear makeup on school property. - Good evening Mrs. Sanford. - Good night, Jenny. Mr. Sanford, have you see the gardener? I'd like some fresh flowers to put.... - Sorry, girls. - That's alright. Where's Susan? She was in a hurry. I think she went with Mr. Sanford. Are you sure? That's what she said. You saw her getting into Mr. Sanford's car? You know why I'm asking. You know why we have this rule about girls not walking home. Yes. Did you see her? No. Which way did she go? Susan! Susan! Susan! Susan! Susan! Susan! All together girls. SUSAN! Once again... SUSAN! Susan! You can hear a thing here. We will look for her. Don't argue. Come on, get in. Keep looking. Do you see anything at all? No. - Oh. no! - Don't panic. I'm going to reverse. Keep your heads down. Can't we move the car? - Come on, let's get out and push. - No! It's bad enough being stuck here without getting covered in mud. We can't just sit here. I'm going outside to get some wood to put under the back wheels. You can blow the horn for an S.O.S. - Do you know how? - Yes. Don't leave the car. That's an order! - Do you all understand? - Yes, Miss West. There! And another. Good. Come on. Right - one here. Hey, Superintendent. What about a statement? - Come out! - Oh, come on Sarge! I didn't put these ropes here for fun! How will you get your facts if I don't write them up for you? Not too close together! Don't spread out too much! Keep in constant contact with me, please. Sergeant Beale! - Are you sure these roads are closed? - Yes, sir. Sealed tight. Then where are all these people coming from? Their own back gardens. We can't seal off the houses too. We don't have enough men. Well, he's gone then. Isn't he? Over someones back wall and over to the high street. For all we know, it could be one of them. Alright, Jim. Let me know when the men get to the bottom road. Jim! Get the reporters away. - Hey! Come on! - Aw, come on. - Where were you? - On my way home. Susan Miller. Age 15 years, one month. Assaulted and strangled. - In that order? - Impossible to say. Why do you ask? It's basic - was death part of the sex act? Or was it just to silence the victim? Let's don't get too academic. - It's another psychological identification. - I know. - How did this happen? - She's from the same school as the other one. Coincidence? Just one girl in 2 months left that school on foot, and she runs into him. I mean, does he live here? Is it likely he practically camps on this trail? Perhaps she had a date with him. No, she had a date with a boy on the other side of town. We checked. I'm wondering about that school itself. Somebody in it. One of the houses on the other side of the common. - Any luck? - No decent footprints. It's too wet. Forget it. Anyway, I'm trying not to let everyone know that I've got an eyewitness. Who? She... She hasn't made much sense yet. She's in shock. Maybe you could help get a description of the man from her. Extract it the way... you know. - I can try. - She's the Art teacher at the school. She knew both of the girls quite well. Miss West, I've brought Dr. Lomax to keep you company. Hello. I know you thought I was hysterical before, but... No...after what you've been through, most women would have... Don't treat me like a child. If you would just listen... I can tell you exactly what happened. In time. Just relax. Doctor, look after her. - He won't listen to me! - He will. Take one of these. No. It will calm you down. Take your time and describe exactly what you saw. Well, we were driving along this road... we came to some mud. I skidded... I tried to back out, and then... I looked out of the back window, and And then, what? Sir! They have reached the bottom road. - Nothing? - Nothing. What do I tell them? Well? - Well, indeed. - Come on, let's have it. Maybe it's the surroundings, I don't know... take her to the office and try again later. That was useless. Alright, sergeant. Scrub it. Wrap it up! Okay lads, that's it! It is strictly forbidden to use the shortcut. Mr. Miller, you are upset.... I'm coming to see her. I'm coming right now. You have to let me see her. I'm coming anyway. It's like a nightmare. No one could be more careful than we've been. Forgive me. We understand, Mrs. Sanford. We just want to look around the school. Ask a few questions, you don't mind do you? - She broke the rules. - I know. - May we look at the staff list? - Lesley... Did I see you at the crime scene? Probably. - You didn't tell me you had been there. Which of you runs the school? I do. And you sir, do you teach? My husband is the administrator. I keep an eye on the gardener. Nonsense! You do the accounting. Roll the occasional pitch. I have to go. My husband will show you around the school. Go ahead, Mrs. Sanford. We want your statement later. Say the word. We want a quick look around, and a few details about the staff. - Upstairs... - Okay. Did you go to the common before or after the police arrived? After. How did you get in? The lane was sealed off. There is a path around the back. I always walk the dog that way. Will Miss Julie West take the witness stand, please? Miss Julie West! Take the book in your right hand and read the card. I swear by almighty God that I will tell the truth and nothing but the truth. You are Miss Julie West of East Lodge, Wood Lane? That's correct. Miss West, tell us in your own words exactly what happened on the night in question. I left the school late that evening, the girls I take in the car had to wait for me. It wasn't until we reached... I realized one of the girls was missing... - Give me a cigarette. - You don't smoke! I think I will start. I can't bare to hear that all again. She seems intelligent. Why should she imagine these things? Or does she imagine them? I really thought - I mean a witness... I thought, "we've got him." We better go back in. No - you go. Could you see his face? In detail. But wasn't it dark? The car lights were on. Can you describe the man you saw? It looked, hmm... exactly like the devil. You mean, Satan? Yes. I see... For the benefit of those of us not familiar with his appearance, could you describe him for us, please? There was a... a kind of glow about him. A red glow. His eyes were luminous. Did he have horns? Horns? The devil's supposed to have horns. I know you think this is crazy, but I'm telling you what I saw. It could have been a mask or something, but I'm just telling you what I saw! Very well, a mask... ...but no horns. No horns. How about a beard or mustache? I can't be sure. But you said you saw every detail. Every detail of the effect, but I'm speaking as an artist. I believe you ARE, Miss West. Thank you, Miss West. I see no need to take anymore of your valuable time. Order! Order! There will be a 20 minute recess before proceeding with this inquiry. - Don't be that way, Darling. All I want... - Leave me alone! Look girly - Look, talk to me and I'll protect you from the others. Get away! What the hell are you doing? Go away and leave her alone! Come on now. You okay? - A pill for every occasion? - We're working towards it. - Take one of these. - Thank you. I told them the absolute truth. i know. Look, I came after you to warn you. You could be in danger. Whoever killed Susan knows who you are now. - You're not suggesting... - It's a possibility. - Surely with him it's a sick thing. - Not anymore. Now, it's a survival thing. Now, he has a psychopathic disregard for human life. Then why didn't he kill Tessa? She saw him. From his viewpoint, she's already dead. She's locked the episode so deep inside that even face-to-face, she wouldn't recognize him now. How can he be sure that she will not recover? He can't. Maybe he's watching. He may be someone close to all of us. I don't know. Just please be careful. Will you? Julie, look at me. Do you notice anything? The satanic glow. The reverse lights. Perhaps, but what about the luminous eyes? Could be eyeglasses reflecting. No, I don't think so. They are much smaller. I'm sure they were real eyes. Do you understand what I'm saying? Forget the color effect for the moment, try to remember the basic features. So, now I know where you live. - Yes, thank you. - A pleasure. Will you have dinner with me tomorrow night? - That's very kind of you, but... - No "buts", love. You're coming. - Well, I think... - 7 o'clock on the dot. - I'd love to. - Great. Goodbye. Julie... You remember - be careful. - Of course I will. - Goodbye. Don't lock the door! What the hell is the matter with you? All I want from you is an exclusive story. What happened that night in your own words. Go away - leave me alone! We will pay you. A lot...perhaps thousands. Yes, sir. Six-fifty. Yes. Very good. We will make a note of it. Yes. Right sir, goodbye. Ah, his Lordship! Step straight this way, sir. - What's this about, sergeant? - You will find out. Come in, Denning. You know Miss West? Would you take a careful look at these portraits? You could see better if you took those glasses off. I can see alright. The Hurst girl? Yes. - Okay. Now what? - Sit down. Would someone mind telling me... I don't know either. I brought the portraits along to prove that I can paint a good likeness. - Do you agree? - You did those? - You're good darling. - We agree. Here's 2 sketches of devils. Everyone's idea of devils. My idea is this, but it may not work. Suppose an article appeared on the front page of The Advertiser, written by you Mr. Denning. The headline to read something like "Can Murder Witness Draw Killer?" The sketches would appear with the article as a teaser. A teaser for the real picture of the killer to appear in the next edition. Understand? Well? - It's fantastic! - Wait a minute... you're offering to set yourself up as a target? Yes. If these appear in the Saturday edition with a promise of the real picture in the Wednesday edition, that would give the killer 4 days... Four days in which to kill you. No. I don't like it. - Come on, Chief! It's a great idea! - No, I don't like it. We're exposing a civilian. I'm volunteering! It wouldn't work. He's not that kind of killer Dr. Lomax thinks he is. Was this his idea? No, nothing to do with him. Do you have a better idea, Chief? Like sprinkling salt on his tail? Shut up, Denning. It will be new. Keep you under surveillance night and day... mobile strike forces on the alert... It's too dangerous. If you've decided to do it, he can't stop you. I know. It's crazy. Absolutely crazy. It's so crazy, it might work. Now watch. Here it comes. Here you are. That's very good, Tessa. Yes, I'll tell him as soon as he comes in. That's alright. Thank you. Betty, if there's anything urgent I'll be at this number. - Bristol? - Yes, the annual conference. - Good morning, Mrs. Hurst. - Good morning. - How is Tessa today? - She's doing very well. Splendid. - Are you going to Bristol? - Yes. I'm sorry I can't make it this year. Well, I mustn't keep you. - Good morning, Mr. Bartell. - Good morning. Any calls? I'll look. Would you steady me? - Leslie... - Yes? Have you seen this? Yes. You might have warned me. I've been trying to calm the parents' fears. Bury their heads in the sand? - I don't think she did it deliberately. - I think it was. What do you mean? She set a trap for him. From now on, she will be in danger. - From whom? - Whoever it is. I'm only concerned with the school. Naturally. Otherwise, it I thought it had anything to do with us... What would you do? Expel me? Miss West! It's alright, Miss. I'm Sgt. Milton. I'm your watchdog. Let me see your credentials. Wherever you go, I'll follow. Don't look for me. Act natural. When you're in the house, keep the door locked. When you leave, don't drive fast. Just drive steady. - Any messages, Jean? - Yes. Your mail, Doctor! - Hello? - Miss West? - Yes. - Miss West, is she with you? - Who? - Jeanie. This is Mr. Greenway. You haven't seen her? No, she isn't with me. She's gone. She was in bed sick. My wife thought she may be with you. If not, I'm scared. You mean the common? Why? She's been delirious talking about Susan and how she must help her. - I must look for her. - Yes, of course. Could you drive? Oh, no you shouldn't at night. - You mean down there? - Yes, in your car. - I will come from the other side. - I think it's a matter for the police. There is no time. Even now she may be... Wait... Are you there, Miss West? I'll come. Thank you. I'll meet you at the bottom of the valley. - Hello? - Hello. May I speak to Mr. Greenway? I'm sorry. They are both out for the evening. This is Mrs. Greenway's mother. I'll call back later. I want to speak to you. - Later. - Now! Leslie! Leslie, I want to speak to you! Right - have you got that? Come in control. Come in control. We will be reporting our position. Over and out. You know where to position your men. Take your squad to the other end. Milton... - Milton? - Yes sir? We're in position. We will wait for your signal. Okay. Keep moving, Miss. Stop here. Put the light out, Miss. Leave the side lights on. Get in the back, Miss. Why? Please do as I say. Hide under the rug. Stay there and don't move. I will be nearby. You men go on the main road - now! - Did you get him? - No sir. Come on, come on. You alright? Right there? Get a doctor. Did you see who did it? You didn't? - What are you doing here? - I've been following you. Milton, get him out of here. Hello? Sounds like they have got him. Alright, alright. Come on, up you go. How far away were you? - 20 feet. - But you didn't get a good look at him? How could I? It was very dark. Alright... Let's recap. Again? - I got back to the hospital... - What time? About nine o'clock. I read your scheme in the paper. I was going to her place when I saw her car driving towards the common. I left my car, and followed on foot. - Because you had a flat tire? - Yes, You can check that. I will. When you got to where she was parked, what happened? Someone was there. I saw a shape in the back of her car. Then he ran away. - And you ran after him? - Right. He knows those woods. He vanished. I see. - How are you for anti-tetanus? - Good. Now, if you don't mind I'm going to see Julie. - Assuming that I'm not under arrest. - I'll come with you. Hang on a second, chief! I should break your neck for printing that story. Let go! It wasn't my idea. - Chief, I remembered something important! - Not now - just a minute! Milton, let him through. Now what is it? Are you alright? I wanted to tell you, but I thought you would disapprove. You thought right! ...just running about in the woods. When I came to where you were. A dog? What type? A big one. Yellow in color. I thought, "it must have someone with it." I had a look. No one was there. Yellow? A Labrador? Yes! That's it! Thank you, Denning. Get the car. Miss West, go home please. Milton stay with her. I'll get a cab and take you home. Let's look around the back. There's something I want to check. Still wet. Put these in the car. Jim, send Thomas to find the path down to Devil's End. Tell him to walk along it. I want some timings. - Hello, Mrs.Sanford. - Well, Mr. Velyan. Mind if I come in? Thank you. Is your husband here? He's in his workshop. - Do you want me to call him? - Not now. Has he been out this evening? I'm not sure. Why? Did he take the dog for a walk? No, I remember now. We've been together all evening. Why do you ask? Nice dog - what's his name? - Grip. - Does Grip go off on his own? Sometimes, I suppose. This evening? It's possible. I did let him out for awhile. - About 7 o'clock? - About then. Would he go as far as the common on his own? He might. It depends if there's a bitch in season. I see. "His hand felt like a snake." Go on, talking may help. Well, as he pressed on me... I, I felt he was sexually excited. He squeezed with his fingertips, exactly on the pressure points. Exactly like a doctor. Did you tell Velyan that? No. No, I had not thought of it until now. - What brought you back? - Leslie, this is... Your wife says that you haven't left the house this evening. Has she? I wonder why she said that. Have you? I took the dog for a walk. My wife's dog. It's one of my duties. - She should remember. - To Devil's End? Where else? Stop beating around the bush and ask me, "Did I rape those girls?" Did you, Mr. Sanford? I could have. He's lying. He's trying to hurt me. My wife's covering for me because she thinks I did it. There's your first witness, Velyan. Ask her if we sleep together. Answer - no. Why not? Because there's not room for 2 men in one marriage. She runs the school capably. All by herself. It's hers. She bought it with her own money. That makes her the breadwinner. And me? The dog's buddy. Is it surprising I prefer the girls? Young, fresh creatures with no male hormones. Leslie! No, please! Yes. I raped those girls. I raped all the others too. Every time I look at them. - Sleeping pills? - Yes. - Three? - Yes, and no argument. Don't forget to lock the door. No need to - I'm staying with you. I'll sleep there. I don't want any more mistakes. You don't mind? We will not trouble you any longer, Mrs. Sanford. You're not going to arrest me? We are not thought police, we deal in crimes of fact, not fantasy. Yes, but I confessed. At least, you can take me to the station for questioning. I know you would like that. The publicity would destroy this school. That's what you want, isn't it? So you are prepared to take a chance on me to... save this school? You were still in the building the night that Susan Miller slipped out. The night she was killed. I left just after she did. - Not by the front door. - By the slipway. The slipway comes out into the common - 400 yards from the main track. One minute's running time. And it's separated by marshland. Unless you have wings... No one was further from them. You could not have reached the girl in time. Let alone, rape and strangle her. Even if you were capable. Good try. Good night. Julie. Come on to bed. Good night. Central control to Charlie Fox. Charlie Fox, over. Message received from Sgt. Milton. Message reads: Dr. Lomax staying at Miss West's home. Please confirm he's been cleared as a suspect. Oh, my God. Shall I confirm, sir? Wait a minute. - What do you think, Jim? - It's a risk. Pass a message to Milton: Leave Dr. Lomax where he is. Julie. Julie, wake up. - Hello? - Oh, thank God. Velyan here. Just checking to be sure you are alright. I'm fine. Velyan. John, it's Lomax. How soon can you get over here? - Half an hour. Why? - I'll tell you when you get here. - Good sleep? - Yes. You're not planning another devil hunt, I hope. No. There is a way to unlock Tessa's mind. But John, there is a risk. Pentathol can release locked memories. Maybe she could remember what happened. What about the shock? It could drive it even deeper inside her. That's the risk. My hope is that it could cure her completely. It's her parents' decision. They left it to me to decide. And I've decided. Will she be able to talk? Almost certainly. Enough to describe her attacker? And to identify his picture. Without her testimony, you would have to find more evidence. Of course. Shall I do it? Yes, do it. - Right, doctor. When? - 7 o'clock tonight. - So soon? - Is that possible? - I'll do my best. - Thanks. Just a minute! As head of this hospital, shouldn't I be consulted first? Thank you. I'll speak to Dr. Lomax. My car's broken down. Will you take me home? We'll talk then. She's my patient. It's none of your business. Anything you do at the hospital IS my business. Okay - what are your objections? Police trampling through the hospital; drug experiments... Drug therapy. Danger to the girl... - That's my concern. - The first two are mine. You would let that stand in the way of a cure? Cure, Lomax? You live on a cloud. She's responding. The pentathol could snap her out of it. Responding? That makes a difference. This way. My new consulting rooms. Fully equipped: instruments, dispensary, oxygen. - Everything you will need. - You mean do it here? Of course! What time did you say - 7? - Yes, but it's too much trouble. - It's no trouble. I'll tell them to have the pentathol ready. You can get it on your way here. - I appreciate it, but... - No buts. And I'll assist you myself. Helping unmask the killer will give me deep satisfaction. Whatever you say. Do you want a drink? No thanks. I haven't the time. - Do you have a package for me? - He didn't reach you? - Who? - Mr. Bartell. He said he'd call you. No. What did he want? - Sodium pentathol - we're out of it. - Out of it? According to my stock, we are. But according to my records, there should be a full bottle right there. - Did someone take it? - It was there yesterday. However, no problem... you can get some at the pharmacy on High Street. Their dispenser is working on it now. He opened just for you. Thank Bartell - he arranged it. Tessa? Hello, Tessa. Are you alright? - We better get her inside. - Of course. Right on time! Good evening, Superintendent. Sergeant. Hello, young lady. Mr. Bartell, this is Miss West. She's here instead of the parents. Dr, Lomax thought it better if she were here. Of course. Very wise. Come in. Dr, Lomax won't be long. Hello? Anyone there? Hello? Hello? Anyone in there? The lights won't work. The door was open, and uh... Come in, love. - I don't have a handkerchief. - Here you are. Hold your nose tight. Very tight, alright? Head back. Do you have any paper handkerchiefs? I'm not the chemist. There's cotton wool here. Oh, great. She will be okay. Bring your lighter over here. I have to find something. Hey! - You said you weren't the chemist. - It's alright. I'm a doctor. - Then you should fix her nose bleeds. - She should consult her own doctor. Alright. God, another accident. Always on a Sunday. Bad drivers. Alright Miss West. You can bring the young lady in now. Come in, Tessa. Wonder what a place like this costs? More than you can afford. H2 calling, sir. Oh - wait here, Jim. I'm sorry we have to go. The experiment is canceled. Miss West, you will have to take Tessa home. Sorry, Mr. Bartel, but we have an emergency. Well, That's that. Too bad that they can't stay, but we can carry on. - But the experiment was for them! - Experiment? This is remedial treatment, Miss West. We're here to see that this poor girl gets well. - Hello, John. - My god! Are you alright? What happened? - Gas explosion, Superintendent. - Who were the other two? A couple who came in off the street. He had a lighter and was helping me. His girlfriend is next door being treated for shock. - Who was the other one? - The chemist He was dead before the explosion. The place seemed empty, John. Look at this. Someones removed all the fuses. - What were you doing here? - Getting the pentathol. This looks deliberate. Will this stop the experiment with Tessa? Maybe. Dr. Lomax, We must get you back to the hospital. He can go with me. We can talk about it on the way. You aren't going to start without Dr. Lomax, are you? Mr. Bartell - Tessa's my responsibility. Do you hear me? I don't want you too continue without Dr. Lomax. Mr. Bartell, I forbid it! Sit down, Miss West and remain silent! YOU! Help me Milton! Help me Milton! Stop him! Stop Mr. Bartell! Tessa! Tessa! I'll radio for help. Mike Victor to control. Tessa! Charlie Fox, come in please. Charlie Fox, over. Message from Sgt. Milton: "Mr. Bartell suspected of kidnapping Tessa Hurst. Believed to have entered Devil's End from the vicinity of his home." No, doctor! No! Lovely hair. I won't hurt you. I won't hurt you. Don't give him room to get through! - Any sign of him? - No. Nowhere, sir. There he is!
