- It was nude, Henry, absolutely nude. It was downright indecent. - It was only a nude statue, it wasn't a static movie. - It's the way they all begin, Henry. First it was those awful French postcards in Paris, then those shameful Italian women in Rome, and now this. You'd think you'd control yourself after 20 years of marriage. - Only 20? Seems like 50. - What did you say? - I said that looks pretty nifty. - I found him in the powder room in the King George hotel. - Oh, my handsome boy. I would never leave without you. And now your reward for taking such good care of my little Casanova. You sexy tiger, you. I wish my public to know that Christina is in love again. Do you and Mr. DuPont plan to get married soon? - I said I'm in love. What does that have to do with marriage? Please, Mademoiselle, we must hurry. - Darling, will you miss me? - I will count the days 'til we meet again in Paris. - One week. It will seem like forever. - You better hurry, or you're gonna miss your plane. - I will miss my plane? - Yes, and I don't, I mean, we don't want that to happen now, do we? - I will miss my plane. - Don't forget your public. I will miss my plane. - Forgive me. Hello there, I'm the Count of Monte Cristo. Christina! You left Casanova! - Now don't you move. Casanova! Here boy. Come on, boy. I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation, Officer, but I am losing my light. - Your light? - Yes, I'm doing a story on Greek monuments, and this is my model. I wonder if I could ask you to pose with her. - Pose. Yeah. - For a magazine? Yeah. - Yes, of course. I'll be happy to pose. - Now, just stand there and say cheese. How do you say cheese in Greek? Nevermind, just say cheese. Alrighty, are you ready now? Huh? - Cheese. - You're a true guardian of Greek splendor. - Yes, that what I am. Go on then. A guardian. - Now just stand there, and count 60 seconds and let me know how it all comes out. - Okay. One, two, three, four, five... - I had a month's holiday from the university, so I walked here from Belgrade. - You walked all the way from Yugoslavia? - Yes, I am in training. Walking is good for my body, and besides, I wanted to visit a capitalist country. - You're in training for what? - I am a hurler. - A what? - A hurler. I hope to represent my country in the next Olympics. Now I must go. - Why? - I must find place to stay. - Well, I know just the place. - But it must be cheap. - You'll find it's the cheapest hotel in town. The owner's a friend of mine. Besides, my magazine's offices are there. Good. - Here, let me help you. Why don't you wait here, and I'll get a taxi. - No, no, no, no. We will walk. Taxis are for Americans. I don't like them. - You don't like taxis? - No, I don't like Americans. Jack, this magazine you work for, what is it about? - What is it about? Well, it's about people, people meeting people. Like you and I got together. Together, Togetherness, that's the name of the magazine. - Oh, Togetherness. That's a pretty name. Togetherness. - Nina. Yes? - We're here. Here? - Mm-Hmm. What's the matter? What's wrong? - Are you sure this is the cheapest hotel in town? - Of course it is. Now, don't worry. They give me very special rates. I'll take care of everything. - Hello, Mr. DuPont. - I want a room for young lady. Give her the one Christina had. - I see you have found your dog. - And be sure you give her the same rates you give me. You're billing my account, see that she gets anything she wants. Anything you say, Mr. DuPont. - Thank you. You've been very kind. - Room 36. I hope you enjoy your stay, Miss... Milova, she's Yugoslavian. - That's nice. - A distant cousin. - It's all right? - Of course, I told you I'd work it out. The lady would like a bath with salts and everything. - Yes Sir. - Thank you. Thank you, Sir. - You like it? - Oh yes. - Good. Now, I have some things I have to do, and I'll be back at 6:00 to take you to dinner. - Jack, I have never been in such a beautiful place. It is a great experience. - Just beginning. - But I'm troubled. - Huh? - It is wrong that I am here. - It would be wrong if you weren't. Now, you relax, and I'll be back at 6:00 to take you to dinner. - Your bath is ready, Madam. - Oh, call me Nina. This is my name. - Yes, Madam. Good day, Madam. - Good day. Madam. - From Belgrade? - It'll be fine, Sir. - She walked all the way from Belgrade. She's an athlete, needs the exercise. - Oh, I see. - Oh, she thinks I'm a reporter, and my suite is the office. Got it? - Yes, of course. - All right. Doesn't know I'm an American, so don't tell her. - No, no, of course not. - She doesn't like us. - Oh, I see, yes. - Probably never meet her, but, just remember I'm a plain, ordinary, working stiff. - Yes, Sir. - Why don't you call me comrade? - Yes, sir. Comrade. Nina, what are you doing? - Running. - Running? Running from what? I mean exercising, I am in training. But, Nina, we're supposed to have dinner. It's six o'clock. No, impossible. Tomorrow would be a much better day for running. No. Tomorrow I go to Olympia. - Nina, look. We'll leave early tomorrow, and tonight, I'll show you Athens. - No. After running, I must have 12 hours to rest. - Yes, Mademoiselle Christina. Casanova never leaves his side. Of course, Mr. DuPont loves him. We all do. Your photograph? It's exactly where you left it beside his bed. Of course I'll tell him when he comes in. Good bye, Mademoiselle. Is something the matter, Sir? - I feel like Muhammad trying to conquer the mountain. - You're not going out this evening, Sir? - No. - Are you ill, Sir? - I think I'll go to bed and get 12 hours sleep. One's health is all one really has. We all let ourselves go. Plenty of rest and no stimulation. Right food, no alcohol, that's the only answer. We must think of our bodies. Forget what nature's done for us. - Nature, Sir? - Yes nature. After all, what's more important than the beautiful, healthy, streamlined body? Is this the place where Mr. DuPont works? Works? Yes, I am Nina Milova, we are going to Olympia. - Olympia, that's impossible? Nina who? - Milova. - Oh, yes, you're the girl. I'm terribly sorry, but he can't be disturbed. - But, we are late. - Please, Madam. - What has happened here? - Happened here? It looks like a disaster area. All these people have worked all night long. Yes, they worked very, very hard. Why don't you come back later or tomorrow? No, I want to see him now. That, Madam, is impossible. Sir? The birds are singing, the sun is shining, and on such a beautiful day. We should walk to Olympia. Oh, you Americans never rest. - You are not allowed to enter this room. - We shall see. - If necessary, I'll lay down my life for Mr. DuPont. Now, for the last time, will you let me by? No! All right, then. Here. - What's going on? - My sister. Family and all that, you know. She'd never understand. Now stay in here and don't come out. Sir? No, Madam. Madam, please. - I am also a judo expert. I thought you might be. - It is late, and we have a long walk. Long walk? - Yes, we are walking to Olympia. It will take us several days. Several days walking. - It will be a wonderful experience. - But, Nina, I have a car. There's no need to walk. - Oh, you have a car? - Well, it's just a little one, it's nothing... - I tried, Sir. I really tried. - Albert, I thought I asked you to lay out my business shoes. I think they've gone too far with men's fashion. - I'm sorry, Sir. I tried very hard to be a good man's man, but there's some things that are bigger than all of us. - He's a man's man, and you have money to own a car? - It's just an old, old car. You know, Everett, the old car I use for... - Which car is that, Sir? - See how hard we worked? Poor man is confused. Everett, old comrade, we have two cars. The big car, the Rolls Royce that belongs to the Chief, out leader, and mine. - What's wrong with your eye? - Nothing is wrong with my eye, Everett, old friend. Now, I want you to get my car, the car I drive back and forth to work everyday, and I don't care what you have to do, but please get my car. - Never fear, Sir. British intelligence is at work. - Now, why don't... Why don't you go downstairs and meet me in the lobby in 15 minutes? - But what will your employer say when you sees that you live in such a mess? - He doesn't mind at all. He's not even here. Or won't be back. Please, won't you let me get dressed. - You go right ahead. I have plenty to do. - But it doesn't look right, me without any clothes on. What will people think? - You have a handsome body. Be proud of it. - So do you. - You know, Jack, you look so tired. Maybe you work too hard. - Yes, I need rest, relaxation. Coffee. Yes, coffee in the kitchen! Why don't you make some while I take a shower? - This is a fine idea. A cold shower would be better. - No, coffee. Coffee. - Now, in your go, it's nice and cold. Your closets are full of clothes. Why do you need so many clothes? - It belongs to my boss, a very conceited man. A capitalist. - Your office here must work very hard. - Yes, very hard. It's the pressure that gets you. - Who belongs to this? - This? That. I mean, oh, my sister, my sister, she dropped in and she's always forgetting things. - You have two sisters? - Now I understand your games. Goodbye Jeff. Get someone to walk with me to Olympia. - But, but but, Nina! Nina, wait! - To my sexy tiger. I don't believe anything you say. - Nina, listen to me. Nina, I can explain everything. - How hard you work, your intellectual recreation, the games you play with your professional women. Well, they may be professional, but comrade, I am a true amateur. Goodbye. - But Nina, this is my sister's best friend, and people are always dropping in here. God bless you. - Thank you. Mr. DuPont, are you sure that's your sister? - Diana, sweetheart, I lied to you. Nina, I'm so glad we ran into each other. Now, Nina, wait. - Why, so you can tell me more of your stories. - Nina, it's important. I want you to be frank with me. Will you be frank with me? - Only if it is important. - Good. I want you to tell me how much of the secret tests you saw. - Secret test? - Did you hear something? - No. - Heaven knows I tried to keep you out of the secret test area. I was thinking only of your personal safety, and, of course, the safety of the test dresser. - Test dresser? - Yes, that brave young lady you saw in my shower, who volunteered to participate in the highly confidential and secret wash and wear tests. - Wash and wear tests? I don't understand. - That's good. The less you know, the less danger there is for you. You cannot divulge, even under torture, what you do not know. - Torture? Oh, I see. - Good. - But Jeff, what were you doing in the shower? - Well, how else can you get an inside story? - Yeah, please. Sophia welcomes you to my place with a bottle of wine. It's grown on our own vines with love and care. It's the finest in all of Greece. - Oh, thank you. - Then you'll taste my souvlaki. Its ingredients were packed with my own hands. I'm the best cook in all of Greece. - Sounds great. - No, thank you. Why? - The lady doesn't drink. We're in training. - Training? - I am an athlete. - You are an athlete. Oh. - Yes, I must stay in condition. - We're watching her figure. - But the wine is good. It stimulates the blood and warms the heart. - Well, that sounds good, huh? - Exercise is better. - Exercise is better. - But it relaxes the muscles, soothes the wrists, and most of all, makes you happy. It does all those things? - And much more. Taste it. - Nina, one glass isn't gonna hurt us. Are you sure it relaxes the muscles? - I, Sophia, assure you it will do all those things. Was Sophia right? - Yes, it does warm the heart. - And very soon you'll be happy. - Don't forget the muscles. - I like it. - A toast to Sophia Bazaleakos. - Soon, very soon you will relax and be happy. Now, I see to your dinner. Right. - She's very friendly. She makes me feel at home. Because we're warm in here. - Remember the muscles. - Jeff, you would like my little country village. It is simple, but it's nice. You'll meet my brothers, their wives and their children, and you'll meet my Papa. Oh, he's a fine man. - Oh, I'd like that very much. - But he's not happy for me. He says it is time I meet a man, get married, have a lot of babies. But I tell him, I have much to see and much to do. - You're absolutely right, you've got a lot of things to do, and you know what I think? We outta get started right away. Is there another man? - No. I study, I train. There is never time. - Well, tonight we will make the time. - Jack, you know, it bothers me that I know nothing about you. - Oh, what's to know? I'm a man and you're a woman and... Remember what your Papa said. - I wish to know all about you. About your family, your home. Where were you born? - Albuquerque. - Albuquerque. - More wine? - Where's Albuquerque? - It's in Mexico. It's Mexico. - Oh, I like Mexico. - You do? - Yes, I have studied about Mexico. I know about your peoples' revolution. You should be proud to be Mexican. - I should? Oh, I am. - But you're named DuPont. I thought you were French. - My name. My great, great grandfather was French, old grand-père. It's a very old French name. DuPont. - I wish to drink to your revolution. - Ah, grand-père would like that. - To the glorious people of Mexico. - Cha-cha-cha. - Cha-cha-cha. - Folks, you are about to witness the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers of Akron, Ohio. Come, little sex goddess. Come dance with me. Watch, you'll get a load of this. - Ah, Henry, I really don't know what gets into you. Just wait 'til I get you home. - Yeah, promises, promises. Hey Clara, see that guy sitting over there? The one with the blonde, remember, the hotel. Come on. Hi there, folks. Remember us? I'm Henry Wozworth, this is my wife Clara Longfellow. Pleased to meet you. - That's a little Ohio humor I threw in there. Well, we didn't actually meet, we sort of kinda bumped into each other in the hotel. Remember? - Really? - Yeah, in the lobby of the Palace Hotel, and hey, that was some short dress you were wearing, young lady. One of those mini mini mini minis. But I liked it though. You sure got great legs, honey. - Henry. - Hey, all those reporters and cameramen. Are you two celebrities? - No. - Well, I understand. If I had a dish like that, I'd hide out too. - We're not hiding out. - Anything you say, pal. Hey, that's a cute looking mutt you got there. My wife got a poodle for me once. - That seems like a pretty fair exchange. - Won it at the county fair, one of those stuffed ones. That's the best kind, you know. You don't have to spread papers all around the floors. - Papers all around. - Hey, I've got a great idea. Why don't you and the little blonde join us, and we'll make a night of it? - I'm sorry, we've got to get to bed. - Boy, am I with you. - No, I mean, I mean we're in hiding. We can't be seen. - Can I spot 'em, huh, Clara? Can I spot 'em? Hey, why ya hidin'? - We're communists. - For heaven's sakes, what? - Commies, reds. - Her too? - I've never met a real communist before. - Never? - Down with NATO. Long with proletariat. - Are you sure you're one too, honey? - I am proud to be a communist. - Just wait 'till I give that travel bureau a piece of my mind. Come, Henry. - Yes, dear. Boy, what a shame. You got great legs, honey. For a communist. - Oh. Sir, please Sir. It's very late. - I'll drink to that. To Madam Bazaleakos, may your grapes never runneth over. - Sir, it's time we go to bed. Yes? - Nina, she says it's time we go to bed. Yes? - Why? I'm too happy to sleep. I want to dance. - It's not necessary that you sleep, but at my age it is necessary. - Mine too. - But, there is still more wine. - Well, then we'll take it with us. We don't wanna waste a drop. - Your room is number six, near the end of the hall. - Why, you are a good woman. You have made me feel welcome in your home. - Thank you, Mrs. DuPont. - I am Nina, he is Mr. DuPont, and he's from Albuquerque, Mexico. - And I will show you it's an old Mexican custom to drink wine in bed. It is? - You might even call it a celebration. - To celebrate what? - Many, many things. - Many, many like what? - Like our togetherness, that's what. - Is it like a party? - It's a very happy occasion. - You are sure? - Positive. - Yeah, I like parties! Where are all the people? - Ssh. We'll surprise them. - Sophia and all of Greece will be with you tonight. - Hope not. - People should be happy like I am happy. Are you happy, Jeff? - Never been happier. I think I can't think about how happy I am. - Oh. - Oh, these foreigners, they always put 'em so far away. - You're invited to our celebration. - What, lady, I've gotta go to the bathroom. - He's gotta go to the bathroom. - Yeah, lady, I'm a happily married man. Miss, I don't fool around. It is a custom to drink wine in bed. - But only with the Mexicans. - That's right, and I'm from Ohio. - I am from Yugoslavia. He's a capitalist, and you don't like capitalists. - Do not, I love everybody. - Why don't you start with me? - Henry, you stop that this minute. I don't know what gets into you. Heaven knows I deprive myself of everything. - You do, Clara. - Henry, I try to be a good wife. - Clara, you are a good wife. Look, I was on my way to the bathroom. - It's always some excuse. Well, not this time. You, I don't know what you are. - Well, she's Un-American. - That's right. And beautiful too. - That's right, and beautiful... Will you cut it out? - What will my friends think? What will I tell mother? - Tell mother to go... - Henry. - Do not be unhappy. We were just having celebration of togetherness. - So that's what it's called? - Yes, in bed. You drink the wine. It is an old custom. - One of the oldest. - Look, that's not like that at all, Clara. - He's right. Sometimes there isn't any wine. - Clara, look. She got me in here. Pushed me into the room, pushed me down on the bed, and started kissing me. Clara, I'm innocent. - 'Til proven guilty. - That's right. - Are you sure, Henry? - Don't you see, Clara? This is all a misunderstanding. Isn't that right, folks? - Wrong. Wrong. - But Henry, what was I to think? You're half undressed in the arms of another woman. - He certainly was. - And Henry, you were kissing. - She was kissing. - I was kissing. - And Henry, you were breathing hard. Almost panting. - Clara, I certainly was not panting. - Well, it was close to panting. - I was just out of breath. - And Henry, you had that look in your eyes. - I did? - I saw it, Clara, it was wild. - It was? I don't feel so good. Henry, all we're trying to do is just help you. - Henry, it's not your fault you have this lust inside you. - This craving for women. Henry, you're sick. - Yeah, I know. Anybody got an Aspirin? - You better lie down. - I better lie down. I think I'm getting hot flashes. - I think he needs a doctor. - I think I need a doctor. - That's right, medical care, rest, a long trip. - A long trip? - Henry, can you hear me? - Yes, Clara dear, I can hear you. - Remember those French post cards? - Yes, dear. Those nude statues? - Yes, dear. - You like them. - Oh yes, dear. - They excited you? - Yes, dear. - He's breathing hard again. - Henry, do you know why you came into this room? - No, Clara dear, why did I come into this room? - Because you're a sex maniac and some kind of a pervert! - Clara, come back. Please, Clara. I'll get well, I promise. Clara, I'll get well. I'll see a shrink doctor. Clara, please help me. Claire, Clara. - Don't move. I wanna remember you like this. Oh, you moved. That face. That face. You remind me of my grandmother. Old... - Grand-mère. - Yes, grand-père and grand-mère. That was the romance of the century. When I think of their love, I know we must not resist this attraction we feel for each other. - Ah Jack, you must learn there is much more to life than physical attraction. - Oh, Nina, you don't know how happy I am to hear you say that. All my life I've searched for a woman who would love me for my mind, and not just think of me as another pretty face. - The mind is most important part of us. - Yes, of course. Anyway, as I was saying. Tonight, I feel a bond with all the great lovers of history. Don Juan. Romeo. Casanova. - Casanova, how can he come in? The door is closed. Get him his own room. - I go get him. - He'll come back all by himself. He's part homing pigeon. Casanova, Don Juan, Romeo and Juliet. Bonnie and Clyde. Jekyll and Hyde. - Ah, he remembered our celebration. - Not again! Look, I gotta go, Madam. Look, lady, my wife will kill me! Clara, Clara! - Clara! - Now we will sing and dance and be happy. - I'm a married man. I can't take it, lady. - It's a very old Mexican practice. - Clara, Clara, what happened? Clara! - We should have gone to Olympia. - Tomorrow we'll go to Olympia. - Tomorrow we walk. Tomorrow we walk. - Hey, Mr. DuPont. I have a message for you. - Thank you. Where is it? - At the address. I have to see a man about a prince. - A prince? - Yes, as in son of a king. Be right back. - Is he a prince? - No, that's the prince's secretary. The prince's yacht docked this morning, and he's expecting me. - Expecting you? - Uh-Huh. - What business does a worker have with a prince? - Business? Well, remember I'm a reporter, and I have an interview with him to write a story. I want you to meet him. - No, it is against my principle. - Well, he's a simple man with simple tastes. - And his simple people suffer because they live in the middle ages. - Well, that's exactly why I wanna see 'em. Reveal to the world the kind of man he is. Can a prince from a little oil country find happiness as the wealthiest man in the world? - Then you must do what you must do. You go meet your prince, and I will go to Olympia. How much do I owe? - Owe? Oh, your bill. - Yes. - You stay right here, I'll find out. - Mr. Papalopolous, I'd like to see my bill. - Your bill, sir? - Yes, my bill. I wanna see it. - But, Mr. DuPont, we always mail it to your office. - I should be able to see my bill if I wanna see my bill. After all, it's my bill. - Yes, Sir. Is there anything wrong, Sir? - Yes, I don't know how to tell you this. - What, Sir? - You see that girl over there? Yes Sir. - She only has six months. - For real? But she's so healthy looking. - Young, strong, vital flower woman, but soon she'll be gone. Call my suite, and tell 'em I've gone to meet Prince Justiani. - But the girl. What is to become of her? - I'll take her with me. Better in my hands than alone. I'll nurse her back to health. - What did he say? - Look at him, he's calling the police. You're in big trouble. - What did I do? - He's gonna send you to jail. Was it my bill? - Yes, I never dreamed it was so much. You can't possibly pay it. It's a thousand drachmas. 1,000? - He thinks you're gonna run out. You're not Greek, you know. What will I do? - We'll make a run for it. Not the front door, they'll be waiting for us. You get the dog, I'll get the bag. They won't take us alive. Put the dog in the basket. - We shouldn't do this. It is wrong. - Nina, do you wanna go to jail? - No. - Then do as I tell you. - But Jeff, running away and now stealing. - I know a place where you'll be safe. Don't worry, leave everything to me. I wonder how this thing works. - To be a hunted criminal, always running. No. I'll give myself up. - Do you trust me? - Yes, I do. - Then listen to me. I have a high friend, friends in high places. - You do? - Yes. If I have to go in front of the United Nations to clear your good name, I'll do it. That's the kind of guy I am. - You are a good man, Jack. I will do anything you say. - Then mount up. - Okay. I'm ready. - When the one great scorer comes to ride against your name, he marks not that you won or lost, but how you played the game. Nina, could you give me a push? - Hey Jack. Over here. Jack, it's good to see ya. How are ya? - Fine, it's been a long time. - This is Candace Josee. - Glad to know you, Candace. - Candace? Please, call me Josee. - And this lovely lady is Nina Milova. - How do you do? - Let me introduce myself. Solomon Justiani, your servant. Jack, she's more than lovely, she's... From Yugoslavia. Great bunch of people, the Slavs. Yeah, I'm afraid that princes are not too popular in your country. - My people believe in sharing the wealth. - I believe in sharing too. Would you sit down? Josee, will you entertain the lovely lady while we discuss some business? - We shall eat, drink and be merry until you return. - We won't be long. - I give you one hour. Then we'll be looking for you. Men. Either you love them or you hate them. They are terribly wicked. - I do not know much about men. - To know men is to live. And to live, you should know all about men. - I don't know, Sol, the price is too high. - Jack, I'm giving you the rights. All we want is the money we've already invested. Plus a few dollars for incidentals. - Like this yacht and the few racing cars? - You wouldn't take a man's toy away, would ya? Deprive him of the necessities of life. - Yes, I would. - Carlos, what was the last figure? - 21,750,310 dollars. - And 52 cents. - I'm a benevolent man. Forget the 52 cents. - Thanks, Sol, but I'm sorry. My offer still stands. - I'm sorry too. It's not often I get to deal with such an old friend. - Talk it over with your partners, let me know. I'll be in Athens a few days. - Wait, I have a better idea. I'll wire Rome, tell 'em your proposition, and have an answer in two or three days. In the meantime, you and the beautiful creature come to Milos with us. - All right, look... If I can convince her. Are you sure he's Mexican? - Of course. He told me so. - I thought he was an American. - Oh no. But his ancestors are from France. - Well, that's too bad. American men are very interesting. - Interesting? They're cruel, heartless and selfish. There motives are quite clear. They think only of themselves. - And she trusts me. What more could a man ask? - You want me to answer that. - No. But she's different kind of woman, Sol. She doesn't want anything from ya. - She is now, now that you're a poor reporter interviewing a rich prince. Wait 'till she tastes the good things in life, the comforts that a rich man can give her. - She doesn't want rich men or comfort. She's basic black, there's nothing phony about her. She's as pure as the driven... - Pure as the driven snow. That's a challenge. - Not a challenge. It's a crusade. - Now Jack, we all know that every woman in the world can be reached one way or another. - You think so? Well, I found her. The problem is how to reach her. - It's quite simple. - It is how? - Look, we're both agreed that she's a most desirable woman, right? - Right. - She has a mind and a body. - In that order, right. - And she's normal in every way. - Almost. - There's only one thing to do. - What's that? - Just treat her like a woman. - Treat her like a woman. - That sounds like good advice. - Well, where's the beautiful rebel? - On the dock, waiting for Mr. DuPont. I ask her to join us, but she says it's against her principles. - She's got a lot of principles. - She says she doesn't want to get in trouble with the police anymore. Whatever that means. - Well, Jack and Nina are gonna sail with us to Milos. - Does she know that? - No, but Jack's gonna convince her. Just remember she's a woman. - Oh, I'll do my best. - She's very fascinating. - Yes, isn't she. - Nina, I didn't finish the interview. It's going to take longer than I thought. - How much longer? - Two or three days. Look, they are sailing to Milos, and we've both been invited to join them. We'll be back in a few days. - No, Jack, I am going back to Athens. - Nina, you'll enjoy the trip. - I must go back to the hotel. Maybe, and maybe I can work to pay my bill. - But Nina, in a few days I'll have the money for the interview, and I'll pay your bill. Besides, I don't want you out of my sight, even for a few days. - But Jack.... - Nina, I have a confession to make. You were right and I was wrong. The mind is the most important part of us. You have stimulated my mind. - I have? - Oh yes. Even though I may touch you or kiss you, it's not the physical attraction that really counts. It's the mental understanding between two human beings that's the most important. - You have learned a great deal. - Oh yes, I'm trying, but I need your help. - I want to help you. - Being together is all that really matters. Our relationship could be like the beginning of time. - Like Adam and Eve? - Exactly. We could share everything together. Just think of it, Nina. We could walk through life, enjoying the dawn of every night, the sunset of each day, by just being together. You a woman, and me a man. - Oh yes. - Then come with me, my darling as my horse, ship, sails into the sunset. - No, Jack. It is against my principles. - Sunsets? - No, the prince. - Nina, if I leave you here, they'll catch you. Send you to jail for five, maybe 10 years. What will it be, Nina? Adam and Eve or a dark dungeon? Life or death? - I'll go, Jack, I'll go. I want to leave. - Smart thinking. Little J.C. in town that we'll be in... - Save us, all mighty prince, save us from the police. - Tell the captain we're sailing immediately. Come on, I'll show you where to hide. You'll be safe in here. Thanks Sol. - What are friends for? - I have never been a fugitive before. - Now, don't worry. - But Jack, when will it end? - Who can tell? Leave everything to me. - It is fit for a prince, just the way you like it. - Thank you. Ah. Perfect as usual. You suppose they're ever gonna come out of that cab? - Would you? - Not only do you have beauty, but many rare qualities. - You mean I know how to pick all your vices. - No, qualities that other women could learn from you. Like our lovely guest. She's a little rough around the edges, but that makes it more interesting. - If you allow me, maybe, I could teach our young blonde goddess what I know about how to keep a prince happy. - Now Josee, don't jump to conclusions. - Solomon, I know you, and your invitation to Jack was not all business. - All work and no play makes for a very dull existence. It's the sport that makes it exciting. - Nina is different, but I'm afraid, Solomon, she definitely is not your type. - That's the challenge. - I think she's in love with Jack. - How do you know? - 'Cause only another woman can tell. - And Jack? - He's a very attractive man. Very attractive to women. - Attractive to you? - It might be a challenge to find out. - Josee, imagine the prospects. Nina in love with me, and Jack in love with you. - You make it sound like it's a game. - But what else is love, but a marvelous game? - You might think so. - I see. How to make it all worth while? I know. I'll make a bet with you. A mink coat to a dollar that before we leave Milos, Nina is in love with me. - That's an easy bet to win. You'd lose. - Josee, I never lose. What do you say? - All right, Solomon. I take the bet. - Nina, it's Jack. - Is it safe? What's to become of me? I will never see my Papa again. - Of course you will. Now, don't you worry. I'll straighten everything out. - That, I am afraid of. Every time I listen to you, I get deeper in trouble. - Nina, everything I've done is to help you. I'm a Virgo, you know. - You are? So am I. I did not know that men are Virgos too. - No, no. Virgo is a sign of the Zodiac. Service to his fellow human beings. That's all I want out of this short and happy life. To be of service. - You do? Then why do you cause so much trouble? - It's been that way my whole life. When I was a boy scout and helped old ladies across the street, they'd get run over. When I was older and joined the missionaries to save the savages in New Guinea, I was the only one they didn't eat. It's a curse I've learned to live with. - Then why do you lie? - Nina. - Yes, you took me to that expensive hotel, think you were a friend of the owner, of the Mr. Papalopolous, who doesn't even exist. - He does so. But he's not the owner. - Ha, another lie. - He's just a clerk. He couldn't do anything about your bill. - And now the police are looking for me. I am on a boat making this crazy trip with people I don't even know. - But Nina, you know me. - I think sometimes you try to take advantage of me. - Nina, at least you know that I'm not after your money. Look, whatever I've done is only because I don't wanna lose you. - Maybe I should know more about men. - All right. Lesson number one. And for lesson number two, we'll have our dinner sent in with lots of wine. - Oh, that would be nice. What's that? - Just music. - Not just music. It is Yugoslavian music. - Oh really. Well, lesson number three... - Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Hipolitas Mollnar, but you may call me Hippy. - I am Nina Milova. A Yugoslavian. - Hungarian. I'm a painter. - A painter? - The most outstanding Hungarian painter in the whole world, if I may say so myself. I thought you were a singer. - I'm a painter first, a singer second. - Why are you not painting? - Because I'm in a state of concentration, generating creative powers within me. I've been in this state for over a year now, but when I begin to paint, the whole world will be astonished. - But, what are you doing on this boat? - I've been with the prince and the countess for over eight months. I've been engaged in Paris to paint a portrait, but it's... The inspiration has not come. I cannot help it. I'm not a materialistic painter. It must come from here. - Oh, of course, if the inspiration doesn't come. - Maybe the muses are not happy with a countess. - But she's very lovely. - Lovely. Lovely. Lovely, lovely, lovely. You know what? - What? - You are much lovelier. You come to cheat the muses. I'm going to paint you first, and then the divine inspiration will come at once, I'm sure. - Do you think so? - Never have my creative juices been so excited. Oh please, stay here and wait for me. You are so lovely. I'll come right back. I will come right back. - Me no... Hablas Espanol. - How come that being Mexican you can not speak Spanish? - Just rusty, I guess. - My girl, Loopy, asked you if you wanted to have a drink. - Yes, thank you. - I'll fix it. Scotch all right? - Yes, I could use it. - You know, it's none of my business, but I would like to know why do you want Nina to believe that you are Mexican? - Well, it's a long story. - A long story? I adore long stories. - You do? - Hippy, you are truly a great artist. So great that you are beyond my understanding. - Thank you, my prince. - You know, Nina, I envy people like Hippy who can create, who have a free and simple life. I wish I could do the same thing. - And why can't you? - Oh, I don't know. Life to me is like a trap. I need to find someone to help me escape from this useless life of mine. - That's strange. Jack says the same things. - Nina, please, give me a little smile. A little more, a little less, a little more, a little less. Do you have to giggle? - I can't help it. - My inspiration has been swelling up within me. - You sure it's not your liver? - Oh Nina, you have given me back my juices. - Oh Nina, I wanna know all about you. Where you're from, your humble beginnings. - I'm afraid it would bore you. - Bore me? Never. Just to be near someone who's so simple, free and happy, would give me great joy. - But it's been a lonely life. A woman needs many things that money can't buy. Experiences. - That's what Nina always says. - A woman needs a man she can love, a man she can look up to. - Look up to. - A man who can sense her moods. Her desires. You can sense those things. I knew it the first moment I saw you. The first moment our hands touched. That you were a man. - Good morning. Isn't it a wonderful day to sing and dance, and be with people? - Wonderful to see my people so happy. No cares, no worries. No breakfast! It's a celebration. - What are you celebrating? - That we are all friends. - I don't understand. - It is a custom in my village to embrace strangers, to take them to their breasts and call them friends. That way, they are no longer strangers. - My friend! It is peace in our time. It is a love without any sexual activities. - You are now my friend. - I pronounce, from this day forth, that Nina Milova and Prince Solomon Justiani are no longer strangers. - Jack. What would you like more than anything in the whole wide world? Your wish is my command. - I would like... - You're like a little boy who needs love and understanding, and much love. - And love. - And make his all the hurts away. - Kiss. - Tell Josee what would make you happy. - Mama. - What? - I want my Mama. - I'm not your mother. Are you disappointed? - Of course not, it's just that I, I love my mother. - I guess all boys should love their mothers. - Josee, about last night, there's something I must tell you. - Yes, darling? What is it? - Well... - Put your arms around me. Hold me tight. Now, how about last night? - You know you're a wonderful person. - So, Schatzi, go on. - And I'm very fond of you. - And I am very fond of you. - And... And the prince is a good friend. He's sort of a good prince. - Yes, isn't he. - And, he's a buddy. You know what I mean? A buddy prince. - You were saying about last night? - Well, if he was bad, a bad prince, I could lose my head, you know what I mean. - You know something, Jack? Talk too much. - I know, but you see... You know what I mean? - Oh, that's so funny. - Well, aren't you two getting along very fine. - Well, you won't believe this, but Nina's been teaching me how to cook. - No, I wouldn't believe it. - He learned very fast. - I'll bet he does. - She's planned the whole menu for tonight. - And I'll make the decorations. It's one of my greatest accomplishments. I shall call it the last supper. Very original, huh? - Well, I must leave. Dinner will be at five o'clock. - Goodbye, my friend. I will think of you every hour until we meet again. - Solomon, she's not leaving town. - Poor fellow has no understanding. Just think, there were two strangers who met in the night. - It was in the morning. - Yes, and I found true friendship. - Oh, Solomon, that's beautiful. - It makes me sick. - Goodbye, my friend. - Goodbye, Prince. - Just what do you think you're doing? - Oh Jack, just trying to be friendly that's all. I gotta get a little rest, had an exhausting day. I'm looking forward to a promising night. - Over my dead body. - Josee, what am I going to do with this unsavory character? - Give him to me, Solomon. I'll tame him. - I know what. Hang him from the yacht arm. - Hanging is too good for him. - Why don't you just cut me up in little pieces and feed me to the sharks? - Not 'til we complete our business. Besides, where am I gonna get sharks? - All right, Solomon, but I just want you to know I think your motives are unethical, insincere, and filled with duplicity. In fact, they're lousy. - It was during this transition period that I found my inner me. The canals of my digestive tract sang out like a little brook that rushes to meet the mighty river. It's the juices, the juices within us that make us what we are. - Well, I'll drink to that. - So, when the guru came to me, pleading for a sign to help him, to help him to find contentment, the spirit came over me. I received a visit. - Now I know what he means by juices. - Where was I? - A spirit was passing over you. - Yeah, the vision that made me help that poor man. I told him, man can not live on bread alone. His soul, his soul must come to roost someday. He was to rebel against the evil forces within himself, the forces... That! - That's very interesting. I'm sure we learn... - Love! Love, love, love, love, love, love. Ah, that was my great discovery. The innocence of little children, or the flowers in there. Why not have flower children? Spread the word of Hipolitas Mollnar all over the whole world. The guru was my first disciple. Someday the whole world will know the great discovery. Love. A toast to love. - I am sorry, but the pig knuckles wouldn't cooperate. Pig knuckles? - Yes, it is an old mountain dish called Souvi. - Sewey? Nina, what is that? It looks like it's moving. - Oh, try it. This is the onions that's slide about. - It's delicious. It's made out of the stomach tissue of an ox. - What are you waiting for? Eat, enjoy it before it gets cold. - Wonderful, magnificent. Wonderful! - I never tasted anything quite like this. - Just like home cooking. - I wish I had a bigger appetite. - I told you they would like it. Thank you. - Goat's milk. - Goat's milk? - The milk of a virgin goat. Much sweeter. Where did you learn to cook such exotic food? Exotic? - He means that interesting food. - My father was the best cook in our village. He teach me. Your father must have had a strong constitution. - Yes, he was champion wrestler of all of Yugoslavia. He say, you are what you eat. - Or don't eat. - Here, you have not tried the granya. It has been in my family for generations. - Must be quite old. - It is often served at the wedding feast, and it's said to bring much happiness to the bride and groom on their wedding night. - Well, what's good enough for the bride is certainly good enough for me. - Here, here, try the goat juice. Jack, are you all right? - What a way to die. - See if he has a pulse. - My watch stopped. He's breathing again. - Where am I? - In heaven. You have been reincarnated as a goat. - Oh darling, I was so afraid I would lose you. Maybe I should take him to bed. - No, no, it's not his bedtime yet. Here, he needs a little air. Come on, round the deck. - What is granya? What is... - Cabbage with garlic, green peppers, hot mustard, tabasco, lots of tobasco, and slices of eel, raw eel. - Oh, Casanova! Casanova! It is so wonderful to see everybody so happy. - Jack. Jack? - Yes, Doctor? - Jack, it's Josee. - Everything's gone black. I can't see. My eyes! I can't see! - Now you can see. - For a moment my whole life flashed in front of me. What am I doing here? - You fainted and became delirious. We brought you here so I could take care of you. - They're fine now. Great, thanks for everything. - Where do you think you're going? - Going? - Yes. Men in your condition should rest. - I feel fine, great. Never been sick a day in my life, Josee. I've been a brick. Josee, would you open the door? - Give me one good reason. - Solomon. - You have to do better than that. - All right. It's just that sometimes, when I'm alone with a woman, I can't control myself. - Sometimes? - Like now! Now, don't fight me, because I get upset. - But, Prince Solomon, you could be lost, because universities, libraries, that could help your people. - I tried, I really tried, but with little success. - Then you must try harder. - If I had someone like you to help me, I'd spend it like water. - How can I help? - We could travel the world over to depressed areas like Monte Carlo, London, Paris, bringing understanding and beauty to people who really need it. Nina, look at me. - I'm looking. - What do you see in your friend's eyes? I see... - Go on. - I see a man who has suffered. A man who... - Go on, I'm not afraid. A man who wants something, but doesn't know how to get it. - I knew it. The minute I saw you, I knew that you were the one woman in the world who could give me understanding and help. - I want to help you. - Nina, may I kiss you? - If it will help. Oh Nina. I wanna buy you all the beautiful things a man can buy a woman. - You are very kind. - No, not kind. Selfish. Come, come with me to a place, to a place where I can confide my deepest secrets. A place where you a woman, and I a man, will find the peace that we search for. - Where is that? - My cabin. - His cabin? - You are wicked bad. - See what I mean? No control. I don't even know what I might do next. - Next? You are not only wicked, you are dangerous. I don't think I should do it. What do you have to lose? Try. What do I do with my hand? Let me show you. There. Hold me tight. Tighter. Don't worry, my little princess, I've got you now. Oh, Solomon. What happened? - Poor soul, you should never be left alone. - Good morning. Good morning, Solomon. Morning. Solomon? His name is Prince. - Oh, I used to have a dog by the name of Prince. Oh, he was a magnificent animal. My constant companion. He loved me. What happened to him? - He ran away with a chow. I often wonder if he's happy. - Have I told you how lovely you look this morning? - Three times. - It's incredible. It's really amazing. - What, Solomon? - Your beautiful blonde hair, the purity in your face. Do you know what you remind me of? My mother. Oh, thank you, Solomon. - No no, don't say anything. The tragic prince has ended his search. It's like, it's like a... - A miracle. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Perhaps I can have happiness. - You can, Solomon. - Listen, all of you. I'm announcing my throne for the heart of this woman. - Bravo. - I don't know what to say. - Just say no. - Solomon's heart is honest, full of love and goodness. Not like someone else I know who lies. - Nina, don't be too hard on him. Lust and greed sometimes warps the minds of men. He knows not what he says. - I don't, huh? Well, why don't you just stand up and fight me like a man? - If I must, I must. - No, Solomon. Well, what is a prince without his honor? - I thought you renounced your throne. - All right, you challenged me, what will it be? - Half a pistol for 20 pieces. - This will do. Hi-ya! - After I trash you, I'm gonna cut you up in little pieces, and feed you to the sharks. - You will, you, you molester. - Molester? - Now stop it, you two. Really, stop it. I have never seen two grown up men act so much like idiots. Two men so vain, so superior and so egotistical. Come with me, Nina. I can't stand the sight of them. - Beautiful, wonderful! What a performance! - Nina. Nina, you hear me? Nina, you open this door. Nina, you either open this door, or I'll break it... - Jack, I have to talk to you. - Now, Josee. - Jack, listen to me. - Now, Josee, people do talk and... Think of my reputation. - I'm thinking about mine. - Shall we dance? - Oh no, be serious. What I'm about to do may change the course of history. - I don't know, but I think a boy would be nice. Just like you. Strong, intelligent, and handsome. - But first first a girl. Soft and lovable, all in pink. Just like its mother. But what if it's twins? - What are you two talking about? - We will love them twice as much. - Don't mind me, I'm studying for the priesthood. - Jack, darling, say it again. - I've been a blind fool. All along, you been right beside me. I didn't realize 'till this morning, that you were fighting for the man you loved. The anger in your eyes, the passionate pleas, all for me. Tell me more. - How any man could ignore your beautiful mind, your fantastic face and your lovely body. Josee. - Yes? - You won't believe this. - Cut that out. - And you will love me and honor me? - Yes. - And never take me for granted? - Josee, I want you to stop that. - I will worship the ground you walk on. - Josee, this has gone far enough. - Excuse me, sir, but aren't you the captain of this vessel? - Of course I'm the captain of the vessel! What do you think I am? - Think of it, darling. Married at sea. - Oh Jack. - You think you're pretty smart, don't you? Well, three can play that game just... - Hello there. What are you two staring at? Solomon, the champagne please. Well, what do you think? Solomon, don't I please you? - Nina, what... Ouch. - Of course, it's... Well, it's just so unexpected. - It was terribly unfair of me to ask you, give up all this luxury. Think of it, Solomon. You have asked me to share your life and your money. Solomon, because of you, I can be like any other woman. We don't know how to thank you. Sweet Solomon. - Nina, what in the world... We? - Yes. My family and I, we are 37... No, 38 of us. Of course, you'd like them all to live with us. - 38? - We would lead a free, simple and happy life. No more would your life be useless. - And no more suffering. - Think of it, Solomon. Everything you wished for would come true. - Now you won't have to renounce your throne. Why, that wedding would be nice. Can a captain marry himself? - Josee, I wanna talk to you. - Solomon, we are like one big happy family. Anything you want to say, just go ahead. Say it. - Alone. - Say please. - Please. - Don't be long, Solomon. We have so much to discover of the one we marry. - Go take those clothes off and wash your face. You look terrible. - I thought you like your women this way. - Well, I don't like you that way. Now do as you're told. - No, it's time you learn that it's a woman's right to do and act as she wants, and no man can stop her. - Nina. Nina, you're not being you. - How do you know what I am really like? What I feel, what I think? - I know what I think. I... I think I love you. Mentally love you. - What about your kind of togetherness? - I think a man and his wife can work that out. Together. - No more games? - Never again. - And no more lies? - Look, he is coming. He is coming! Who's coming? - J.C., that is who is coming. It's the secret police. What are you talking about? Now even the government is after me. What will I do? - Nina. - What will I do? Nothing. - Just think of something. I'll be arrested. Nina, there's nothing to worry about. - The police will take me away from you for five, maybe 10 years. They will put me in a dungeon. It's life or death. - Sometimes I think men like you outta be put in jail. - What did I do? - You're a heartless man, Jack. All you think of is a pound of flesh. You're heartless. - Solomon. - J.C., how are you? Good to see you. - It is J.D.? - J.D., I want you to meet J.C. - J.C., I've waited a long time for this moment. - I hope that you find a financial benefit to all of us. - Well, that's why I'm here. - Well spoken, young man. I'd like you to meet my associates. R.T. and M.N.O. M.N.O.? - M.N.O. You invest your spicy river. In the business world, one can't be too careful. - Let's we get started, gentleman. My office is below. - Thank you. - Sorry, J.C. - My apologies, J.C. - You are on my foot, R.T. - Sorry, J.C. - Who is that creature? - P.D.Q., J.C. She is one of the best. You don't say? - Okay, but keep it on the Q.T. - Little Casanova, you have the good life. All you want is love and attention. I am glad you are not human. A dog does not have to go to prison. Do you think Jack would wait for me? But he loves me. Maybe we could escape to Mexico. You are right. Running away does not solve the problem. I must be brave and face the orchestra. - Nina. Nina. Nina. My heart is aching for you. Jack DuPont is not the man he says he is. He is a Judas. - Hippy, what are you talking about? - It's nothing, these are things for me to do. Here. No, it is not true. - Christina, star of motion pictures and Europe's sex kitten, has announced that she and Jack Dupont will be married in the Fall. - Christina and Jack will set up housekeeping in Baltimore, Maryland, birthplace and home of the estate of Jack Dupont. Baltimore, Maryland. Albuquerque. Mexican, a reporter. I'll... - Shoot him. - All the time he has lied to me. Life or death, he said. - We'll beat him with a rubber hose. - Wait, wait, until I get my hands on the dirty... - Rat. - Gentleman, on this historical occasion, I propose a toast to Mr. Dupont. A white knight on a silver charger. A silver night on a white charger. It has been a pleasure to do business with you. Long may your company flag wave. - I suppose you are celebrating your little joke. It must be very amusing for all of you. You're the richest man in the world. - But Nina, I was gonna tell ya. - More lies. There hasn't been one ounce of truth or decency in anything you've ever said, you Judas. - There was too. - Oh, now Nina. - Don't now Nina me, you pompous... - Jackass. - Yes, you are as bad as he is. You sit here in your luxury, playing games at peoples' lives. Who gives you the right to say who I love or don't love? - Nobody does. - You call yourself a prince? Well, I feel sorry for you. - Miss, how dare you to speak like that to a gentleman. - I don't know who you are, but you are probably just like the rest of them. - Three down! Two to go! - Nina, listen to me. - I've done all the listening to you I am ever going to do. You have been an experience, a bad one, one I am going to try and forget. - Nina, I love you. - Well, I hate you, you sexy tiger. - Are you just going to stand there? Jack, go after her. She loves you, you know. - She does? - Yes. - Yes, she does. - Well, Prince Valiant, do something. - Man over board. Man over board! - Not him. About Nina. - She hates me too. - Who doesn't? I think you should call the police. - That's a good idea. Why? - She stole my clothes, didn't she? - I'm innocent, let me go. I have done nothing. I am not a thief. This is no way to treat a Yugoslavian. Nina Milova. - Yes? Do you realize the grave charges against you? - No, Sir, but I am innocent. That's what they all say. Guilty or not guilty. - Very guilty. And you were right about everything that you said about me. I had it coming. - I think maybe I said too much. - Nina, a woman can never say too much. Sometimes these men need all the help we can give them. - And Jack? - He's pacing outside like an expecting father. Nina, are you all right? - Yes, Mister... - It's me, Jack. Remember? - I vaguely remember such a name. The same name, but a much different guy. Oh. - Yes, I've really changed. You'll see. - You have? You look the same. - I do? I mean, Nina you've taught me an awful lot. - I thought you were the teacher. - Did I say that? Nina. Nina. Yes, and you also said we would try experiences. - Now Nina, I have said all the wrong things. But from now on, cross my heart and hope to die, no more stories. - But Jack, don't you want to share experiences? - What? Oh yes. - Good, you will make my Papa very happy. Your Papa? - Yes. After we are married, we shall have lots of children and live in... Where do you live? - Baltimore. It's not a little village, but... But how far is it to New Mexico? - Nina, America's a very big country. - I know, but this is good. But how far? - Over 2,000 miles. Why? - Jack, on our honeymoon, could we walk to Albuquerque? - Excuse me, Sir. But could you tell me, is this some kind of a native ritual? - Ritual? No, Madam. It is called love. It makes the world go round.
