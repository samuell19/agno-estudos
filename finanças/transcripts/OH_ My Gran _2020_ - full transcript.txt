Do you know what time it is? Aren't you even embarrassed to come in so late? - Stop it! - Stop what? Oh, Lord... These are hit-and-run claims. HQ wants a deputy on them. Why is that? Seriously, what's with you? What's wrong? Hit-and-runs don't boost my performance! Just tell me to resign. Let's work on it together. Did you not hear what I said? You do it! I'm doing it. - What the... - It's a client. Seoul Insurance loss adjuster Hwang Du-won speaking. I'm at Samjeong Motors. Did you order not to total my car? Could I get your case number or plate number? 4989 Grandeur! XG! You insurance people never do your damn job! This accident took place in Geumseong, I see. To total a car, the damage must exceed 80% of the car's price, but your car's damage was 3%... You sure are chatty for a guy who fiddles with money in an office! If the car owner tells you to total it, then total it! - How dare you defy me? - So totaling your car is what you want, am I right? Yeah, total it! All right. I'll fetch your money now, so stay where you are. Get over here, you punk! What? What's wrong? There's not a single clean one. Resignation Letter I'm gonna work in the field. Hey, go easy, okay? Our hothead's at it again. Is he working outside or checking out? Out of my way... My Dumpling In-jae, good morning! Hey, there! - Did you have breakfast? - Sure did! My God! It needs to be totaled for sure. This is trash. Look, here! I'm handing in my resignation letter! So don't bother me, okay? Got it, 4989 Grandeur? Who's that idiot? The money-counting guy you talked to earlier. Buddy, what are you doing on my car? You wanted to total it. So I'll have to create an accident! Hey! Just give me the money! That's nonsense. Sir, to total a car, the damage has to be 80% of the car's price. So let me help you. I'll up the damage. A collapsed ceiling would be 30%. My Minky! Rockslide. Say some rock fell. The C-pillar! The door too! Collateral damage, 50%. How are your kids? Kids grow up by themselves. Mr. Hwang, you're doing great work here. This one's on the house! Right foot? 65%! Hood. - 75%! - Daddy! Bo-mi! Why didn't you answer my call? My dumpling! What brings you here? Hold up. What's with your hair? Saint Oh used the clipper to catch my lice! Then she came to and said she needs to die and ran up the hill! That old fart! What we should do is... I'll fax you the estimate. - Let's go! - Daddy, wait for me! Bo-mi, you're gonna leave without saying good-bye? Do it here. Say good-bye. - Good-bye! - Good-bye! That's exactly 80%. He's so precise! This stupid knot is the death of me! Hey, go get me a ladder! You're gonna die there today? Use this instead! Did you come prepared for my funeral? What a filial son! I heard you're dying, so I came for the show. I'm tired of coming to see you die every time! There are other places to die. Why always up there? Why don't you go to the peak? In my dream last night, your father fetched me here so I wouldn't bother you anymore! I told him I want to see Bo-mi go to college before I go. He smoked like a chimney and said he'd be back. You two fought every damn day. Now you miss him? Mom, you got the wrong tree. This tree's good for tying. It's perfect for you to die! Really nice view too. Daddy! I need to poop! Du-won, I gotta do a perm at my shop, so I have to run. When Auntie dies, take good care of her body! - What? - Auntie, that's no good. Grandma, see you at home! It was pointless raising a motherless child! Your grandma is dying, and you're gonna go poop? Let's go poop! Mom, you should die here! It's really strong and has a great view. The perfect spot for your afterlife! Mom! Mom! Mom. Are you okay? You idiot! Stop saying you'll die after causing trouble! Take your dementia pills! Get up! Let's go. I'm starving. Jeez! Go away! ♪ Chi-ling, chi-ling, Secret Jouju! ♪ I can't see a damn thing. What do I do with this? Grandeur. Yeah? Then what does this look like? Daddy can't see anything. Goblin Watch! Daddy, all my friends have a Goblin Watch except me. No Goblin Watch, and no mommy...

Your daughter was in an accident! Come to Geumsan Hospital at once! Oh, you're doing good work in China. - What are you talking about? - I'm a bit busy. See you. Sir? Sir? We touched. You know what? Your eyes are so pretty. Come on. My Dumpling Who the hell are you? Aren't you Bo-mi's father? She was in an accident. - Stop prank-calling me! - It's not a prank call! You mustn't joke about this! You must come to Geumsan Hospital now! - If this is a prank, - It's not! - you're dead meat. - I'm hanging up. Baby, I'll be right back. Can you wait for me? Don't hook up with other guys. Just wait for me. Promise me. Promise. I'll be back shortly. Yang-gang, don't go anywhere. I gotta get my cell phone. You're holding your cell phone! Mom! What are you doing here? Brother, Sister's hurt... Bo-mi's hurt? Are you serious? Bo-mi! Bo-mi? Bo-mi! What happened to my baby? - Are you her guardian? - Yes, she's my daughter! She was in an accident. She had a cardiac arrest, so I performed CPR... So? Is she gonna be okay? Well, her blood pressure is back, but she lost a lot of blood, and she was left alone for too long... What? Who left her alone? Will you be more specific? Sir, I can't guarantee that she'll regain consciousness... You're a doctor. Why can't you guarantee it? You idiot! Who are you to say that? Where the hell were you? Du-won! I heard Bo-mi's hurt! Cheol-sik, how did you know that? An officer on duty reported Bo-mi's hit-and-run, so I came. Is she okay? Hit-and-run? Is this a hit-and-run? I don't know... But... Auntie lost her mind again and took Bo-mi to get rice wine... You went to fill the kettle? Why did you take her? Who was the driver? If I knew, would I be here? 60cm, it could be an SUV. Cheol-sik, Auntie saw the whole thing. Auntie, do you remember the car that hit her? I don't know anything. How could you not? Who did this to her? I don't know anything, I'm taking my pills. Are you desperate to take her life too? Mom, I can't live without her! I don't know anything. Dad told me to get rice wine! Stop shouting at her. You know she's sick. The accident took place near Arabian Nights. Finding a witness is what's important. If you remember anything, call me right away. Okay, mister. It's Mr. Hong, the Arabian Nights owner. Anyway, thanks for coming at this hour... Don't worry about it. Mr. Hong! You idiot! Are you insane? How could I not go insane with my kid like that? Why did she end up like that? Tell me! Mom took her to get rice wine! Why did they go out? Why are you asking me that? If Mom didn't lose her mind, she'd be home sleeping! You're the one who was out and partying! If you had been home, would the kid have gone out? To be honest, Auntie's not at fault! Why isn't she at fault? She shooed my wife away. That was the beginning! You jerk! Auntie! Auntie, these are dirty. Don't touch them. To the delivery room. - Did you call the anesthetist? - Yes, I did. - Her water broke! - Sweetheart... Sweetheart! Bo-mi... Bo-mi? Baby, I'm gonna catch the guy who did this to you. Mom, you can't be in here. Come, come on out! Baby! Don't ever come around! 11:55, 11:55... Arabian Nights Road Closure During Thanksgiving Festival From 8 PM until midnight on the 11th... Why did you make me come back? Where was your car at the time? Because of the festival, there was a road closure, so I parked my Mercedes by the park. What's wrong? Does that van have a dashcam? It doesn't. Dashcams don't cost a lot. Use your money on something. One dashcam on it would've been perfect. It's a hassle. Is that why you called me down? I'm busy as heck! You're abusing your authority. Get me a dashcam, then! Yes, Det. Kang! You know the guy who's in charge of street security cams, right? - Sure do. - Okay. Get me the footage from 8 PM to midnight on the 11th. Dammit... Can I borrow your lighter? Ang-ja! Punk, Ang-ja is a witness too. Ang-ja? The 911 guy was saying he loaded Bo-mi and Auntie, and Ang-ja wailed like there's no tomorrow. You know that ambulance? Ang-ja kept running alongside it! Even an animal's like that, but her dad was partying. Ang-ja, did you really run? - I'm a jerk! - You sure are. You ran to save Bo-mi, but I was getting drunk! You're the parent, Ang-ja! - I'm a useless father... - Look at that moron. - Yeah, Cheol-sik. - I met Mr. Hong from Arabian. I requested security cam footage of the accident's location. I'll let you know, so stay positive. Yeah, thank you. Ang-ja... Geumsan Hospital Jesus Christ... Hey! Hey! Moron, get up! Is Bo-mi awake? Listen to your bullcrap. The doctor's doing rounds. Get changed! And wake her up! Why is she sleeping like this? Her feet are cold. Auntie? - Auntie, time to get up. - I didn't sleep a wink... I'll take Bo-mi's temperature. Big butt! Really big butt! - Freeze! - Freeze! Big butt! This won't do... Come, let's go outside and let her do her thing. - Big butt! - Stop it! I checked the control room, and because of the closure, that's the only car caught on camera. Yes? Good morning. Sorry to bother you so early. Are you the owner of 7878? Yes, what's wrong? I'm from Geumsan Police. Looking for a Witness Cheol-sik! Did you get anything? Any tips? Who'd even look at that? No tips on the hit-and-run. What are you saying? Du-won, you'll understand. Because of Thanksgiving, the road was closed. That's why there's nothing. The security cam was too dark. Only Bo-mi was visible, and nothing pops up on the dashcam of the guy who got a speeding ticket. There's nothing. It's driving me crazy. So? Look into it further! You're gonna give it up? Of course not. Why would I give up? I'm your man. But this is a hit-and-run. You know what those are like. Without any tips or witnesses, there's nothing to go on. And everyone's busy because of the by-election. But you'll investigate when you have time? Of course, hang in there. Let's wait a while. Higher! Pull up! - Pull up! - Dammit, it's not visible! To hell with the election! You didn't have to... Chief, you came? Du-won, hey. You're not busy? Of course I am. I'm busier without you. Sir, when do you think you'll return to work? How could you ask him that? Where's Mom? Didn't she go out with you? Your mother's gone? I told her to come back here. Mom! Ms. Seo, you know Auntie, right? - Go look for her. - Okay, I'll help. What about her? - Stay with her! - Chief! Mom! Did you see my mother? She's not there? Did you see a granny in a green cardigan? - She's not upstairs! - I'll check outside! Mom! She's got a perm. She has a nametag, saying Oh Moon-hee. Didn't see her? Oh Moon-hee! - Yes, Detective. - Du-won, your mom's stirring trouble at the station! What? Chi-ling, chi-ling! In the name of justice, I won't forgive you! The butt was big. I know it! - Transfo... - Ma'am, you got so much energy to go around! It's me, Cheol-sik. Remember me? Eat this snack, and let's go home. No way. I'm not going! Ma'am! - Grab her! - Hey! Mom! - Stop the villains! - Mom! How dare you! Don't you dare touch my mom! Du-won, what happened was... I don't know how she got here, but she made a big stink telling us to get the perp. This is a violation of human rights! She's a frail... She's not frail! How could you handcuff a poor lady with dementia? Free her at once! Who put handcuffs on her? Take her home now. Chi-ling, chi-ling, Secret Jouju! Transformation complete! Big butt! 11:55! Ang-ja knows! Saint Oh knows! Ma'am, I hear you! But how can we... believe a sick woman's words... Everything! She's a witness! She said she saw everything! Ang-ja saw it too! Yeah? Who's Ang-ja? Where is she? Ang-ja is my friend... She's her friend. She's doing well at my place, so don't worry about it. What the hell? Where did that dog come from? Ang-ja, she's my Ang-ja. Yeah, my dog's a witness too! You all ignored what my mom said! You didn't listen to her at all. You'll live to regret it! So investigate Bo-mi's case properly! Properly? If you're not gonna do your job properly, give it to the dog! And you, at the very least, get her to remember the plate number. That gets you a right to shout! Get the dog out! Is this a police station or a pet shop? What are you doing? - Jesus! - Damn! No Mrs. Oh Moon-hee and her dog allowed! Print, stamp, copy... Stay a few meters back! "We Are Happy Together!" Seniors Party This is the best seniors party that I've ever MCed! We'll bring in her adorable daughter-in-law now! It's too dark to see anything, but it's the file from the security cam footage. So you're saying her case won't be investigated for a while. No, no. I'm checking all vehicles in and out of Geumsan. So be patient, okay? I told you more than once. This world is full of craziness. Why not be a crazy winner? Be the winning crazy. Winning at a time like this means Bo-mi waking up. Dammit! Very good! That's great! Let's hurry and get to the hospital! Everyone's insane... Repeat after me. Don't go further than a meter. So pretty, Brother! Repeat after me! No further than a meter! No further than a meter! Come on, if you're slow, I'll leave you. Okay, okay, okay! So pretty, so pretty! I can't watch my kid getting hit by a car! You're a dad. Act like one! You have to see it to figure out the car! Brother, this is good. Is this a vitamin? Saint Oh's pill. Come, sit on this time-out chair. Look straight. That's being a father! No, I can't... Oh my, oh my... I got drunk while she got hit! I can't believe this! I'm sorry, Bo-mi! Why did you have to come? Bo-mi, our poor Bo-mi! It must've hurt... I'm a jerk. Granny... Daddy... Bo-mi woke up... Doctor! Bo-mi. Dumpling, my dumpy! Look at Daddy. Sir, I think she's saying something. What did you say? Ta... something ta... Santa... Santa? Santa? Santa! She came out of a coma to ask for Santa Claus! Bo-mi! I'll catch all the goblins with Santa, so get up soon, okay? Move aside. She's looking at something. Move, what is she looking at? Is she looking at that? Bo-mi, you mean this? Santa? Santa Fe? S... M... Santa Fe SM? Big butt! If I'm right, blink your eyes! - She blinked! - I don't believe this. Baby, I'll take care of everything. You didn't need to use your energy to tell me that! Bo-mi, call me a jerk. - Jerk. - Him? He's your son. Hyun-bae! Take over on this side. I'll get the bus. Det. Park, let's block that bus. - Cheol-sik. - Yeah, Du-won. Bo-mi woke up! Oh, yeah? Congrats, buddy! I didn't do crap. You're the one working on her case. As soon as she woke up, she gave us Santa Fe. Santa Fe? Is that an ice cream? No, a car! Yeah? She said that? - Sure! - Yeah? She's a car prodigy, Hwang Bo-mi! What did I say? Be the winning crazy! Now we know it's a Santa Fe SM model. But that's not enough to find it, right? Now that she woke up, it's a start. It's something. I'll come by when things die down. Let's talk more then. Sure thing. It's Goblin Watch! Can it sync with my phone? Yes, take a photo of the QR code and activate its GPS, and you can track your child. It's showing our location. A toy can track your location? Please have some. Thank you. Oh my! Du-won, Du-won! - This is bad! - What? Fire! Fire! She was sleeping fine! - It's beeping! There's fire! - It's my fault. I was away for a bit... What did Mom do now? Fire! Fire alarm's going! Extinguish the fire! She was quiet about fire for a while... She disconnected Bo-mi's life support! Let's move her! Bo-mi! Where are you taking her? - To the CT scan! - Is she okay? A mother who's trying to kill my child isn't my mother! You and I are done! I'm not your son, and you're not my mom! Go away! Get out! Now! Mom. Mom. I never blamed you when my second child was miscarried because of your dementia. Mi-sook, who left Bo-mi and you behind! Everyone in town badmouthed her, but I can't! Because it was all your fault! But why is my child like that? Explain yourself! Talk to me! What sins did I commit in my past life? How did I wrong you? Bo-mi is the only one who's keeping me alive... Poly... Stop calling me that! I'm sick of it all... Saint Oh, let's go cherry-picking. Poly, is your hand okay? Yeah, it doesn't hurt after eating cherries. Auntie, she's stabilized. Now that she's stable, why not apologize to Du-won? Poly, here, get up and eat cherries. It won't hurt at all after eating this. Auntie, what's with you? Eat these, get well, and play with me. What's wrong? This is Bo-mi, your precious granddaughter! Hey, stop it. Poly. Poly's right here! Here! My precious darling... It's all my fault... It's all on me, Poly... - Mom. - Poly... Poly... - Mom! - Auntie! Doctor! Mom! Mom! - Nurse! - Mom! She always said Poly this, Poly that, so I wondered who it was. So you're Poly? Don't even mention that. Come on, Dad! She called me Poly because I was a polydactyl. When I was 7 or so, Dad took me to the town to buy me a Choco Pie. Yangjeon Convenience I was excited and just followed him. Then he led me to the shop's storage. Then he suddenly embraced me and put my finger on a cutter. I was so scared that I passed out. It hurt like hell. I thought I was gonna die. But it felt so warm, and I woke up on Mom's back. She cried and wailed nonstop. She begged for forgiveness and kept apologizing. She picked a ton of cherries because I loved them. I grew up like that as a pampered child. But after I got married, she harassed my wife. She counted Bo-mi's fingers as soon as she was born. She stressed my wife out. It got worse after the onset of dementia, which led to a miscarriage, and Mi-sook left home. So you still can't forgive her? I don't know... Anyway, don't ever mention Poly again. I'm sick of it. What's wrong with her? Bo-mi! Bo-mi! Why are you crying? What's with her? She could dehydrate! - Get the doctor! - Doctor! I bought you Goblin Watch that you wanted so much. Put this on and get up soon. Please step aside. Bo-mi, stop crying. You're tearing me apart. Maybe she heard your story, and she's crying for Granny. She's like this because of her granny! When Auntie's mind was clear, she said to Bo-mi, "Your mom left because of me," "so I'm very sorry to you and your dad." Then Bo-mi comforted her and patted her shoulder like an adult and said, "Grandma, I don't resent you at all." "Dad will feel the same too." What are you saying? What I'm saying is, she felt something... Be quiet. You must've been startled. Don't worry. I'll give her something to calm her down. She was crying. Does that happen to others? It happens. If I forgive Grandma, will you stop crying? Bo-mi, will you wake up if I forgive Grandma and catch the driver? Don't cry. I'll catch the man who did this to you. Big butt! Auntie, you're okay? Big butt! Stop it! Used Car Collective! Santa Fe SM '09 model. It's got a big butt. Big butt! Ang-ja knows, Saint Oh knows! Mom, are you saying that car's got a big butt? Yes, big butt. 11:55! The accident occurred around then, 11:55. Look at this. What about this? Straight brow, super ugly! I see. Okay, you passed! Auntie is really smart. Hey, Du-won! Chief. I hate to do this, but I need to take sick leave. What? We're busy as hell here! Just resign, why don't you? Use one of my resignation letters in my 4th drawer. Take care of Bo-mi. Are you a detective? You work for an insurance company. Should I just stay here like a moron? What I'm saying is, if you collect evidence... Saint Oh, you and I need to team up and catch the guy who did this, the big butt car's driver. Yes, I like that! - Let's go! - Go! Wait... All right. Du-won, I'll protect Bo-mi! Mom, this way. Go! Madame, it's been so long! Your kids are doing well? They grow up by themselves. Do you still drive the tractor around? What is the factory foreman doing here? She's cloudy? Please look into it! The supplier says it's crazy to look for all the cars with dents. Crazy... Got anything solid? Like a piece of the bumper. I'll keep an eye on it, so go see Mr. Choi from Hyundai Parts in Deoksan. She still goes nuts over tractors. Madame, take care! Come here! - Madame, good-bye! - Sure, sure. When did that start working again? I pulled them out as a favor for Samjeong's foreman. It's quite a lot even though it's just for the bumper. Thank you so much. These include all cars done with and without insurance? Yes, everything. We were too busy to sort them all though. It's fine. Knowing exactly which part would cut down your work. Sorry about that. Mom, you okay? Mom, Mom? What's wrong? Do you remember something? Ang-ja went boom, Ang-ja. Mom, Mom! Watch out! Ang-ja went boom here. Thanksgiving Festival Why are these posters here? What's this? Hold on. Stay right there! Hello, I'm Saint Oh. Mom, is this the plate number? - Is this 15? - Yeah, 15. - Not 51? - Didn't get the last 2. You're saying this could be the hit-and-run vehicle's? Exactly. Search the database with 15 in the plate number... Ang-ja went boom! - Sit. - Sit. 15. Model: Santa Fe SM License Plate: 15 It crashed. Too many hits could crash my PC. We don't even know if 15 is the first or last 2 digits. Here, drink this. Mom, let's go. A witness could come forward, so let's be patient. - Keep checking the cams. - Sure thing. Try to remember, can't you? Anything at all! Ang-ja! Move out of the way! Mom, it's time for your pills. Come on, now. What is it? What's that? Poly, this is my treasure. It's gray... Isn't this the front bumper? Where did you get this? That's tastier than cherries! Did you wrap this up? In case you don't remember? So you tied it up with Choco Pie to catch that jerk? You did a good job. Mom, well done... Well done, Mom! - Good morning! - Hello there! Chief! Chief! Look who it is... You're finally returning? No, it's not that... Without you here, I haven't gone home in days! - Chief. - Yeah? Help me out. Mom, give that to him. I'll take that. - Chief! - Careful. Du-won, your mom found it? That's incredible. It's the Santa Fe SM's front bumper for sure? I'm certain. Find the vehicle with 15 in the plate number. Insurance, over there. Look up the insured ones on the database, and the non-insured ones should be called up. Doesn't show up in the database. I'll have to call all the non-insurance cases tomorrow. Insurance Non-insurance Appointment for Oh Moon-hee - 30... - Come here. Madame, I'll ask you a few questions. - Think carefully and answer. - Okay. - What is your name? - Saint Oh. You're a saint? Don't look at this. Try to remember. All right, what's your name? Who's the man beside you? Jerk! Madame, do you remember your son's name? I don't know! I don't even expect you to remember "Du-won." Did you even forget Poly? Poly! Mr. Hwang, does she take pills regularly? I mean, I tell her to take them, but I can't be with her all the time... I think her condition worsened after the accident. Taking pills regularly will slow down the disease and maintain the current condition. Aside from pills, there's no way to retain her memory? A few cases had some success with hypnosis. Hypnosis? He's a hypnosis specialist. Contact him if you're curious. Your hair's in bad shape. Come to my salon... Auntie, you're done? What did the doctor say? She's gotten worse. It's still amazing. How did she think of tying it with Choco Pie? She truly is amazing. Wake up now. It's broad daylight. Leave the toy. We have to go now. Bo-mi. Hang in there. I'll catch the driver. Hello, I'm Saint Oh. Du-won! We called them all. Hang in there and be strong! Huh? They called everyone? What? We only helped so you can return ASAP. I could have... called all these... I don't think he got any repairs. What about looking into unrepaired damage? Unrepaired! Because it's a hit-and-run! No repair, just get the claim? Like that 4989 Grandeur! That makes sense. Forward me HQ's unrepaired reports. Dig into the unrepaired reports. It's a Santa Fe SM with 15 in the plate number! Report anything suspicious to Deputy Chief Hwang! Sir, sir! Number 162 is a bit suspicious! 162? You idiot! That's dark gray! What about this one? Even with this much damage, he just kept driving? But the plate is 7543. What if... it wasn't 15, to begin with? But 75? You sure about this number? Big butt! Ang-ja went boom! 11:55! Daejeon Central Insurance? Hey, Mr. Park! I'm calling about the unrepaired Santa Fe during Thanksgiving. Oh, you know about it? Yeah, the one who got $1,000 without any repairs! What? Hit a boar? Give me his name and address. Frequent Boar Sightings Unrepaired is handled by Metal Park. What? Metal what? Metal Park! Park from the Sheet Metal Department... Excuse me... Hello, I'm Saint Oh. Where can I find Metal Park? She's really good at it. How long has she had it? About 3 years now. Dementia took my mother's life. She tore my life apart when she was alive, and she broke my heart after passing. With debt. - So, Santa Fe? - Oh, yes. It's a Santa Fe SM with a 7543 plate. The owner got a claim on the 15th without repairs. Oh, him? He dragged it in here, saying he hit a boar. He said he was gonna total it for bad ignition, so he didn't want to repair it. Did it really look like he hit a boar? There are so many boars here, so no one goes out at night. A boar killed an old lady at the field recently. Totaling a car... pays out $1,000 or so. I scrapped it too. You scrapped it? Where's the junkyard? You'll check it out? It's not far. Where's the bumper? Mom, do you think we can find it? Just the gray ones, like this! - This color! - Gray? Honey, take this! Come on... Should we start a treasure hunt? Sure! Saint Oh would love that! Where the heck are you? This is gray too! What's this? Why is this so stuck? Seriously? Mom! Get away!

Jesus, no wonder she's smarter than other dogs! What a waste of money! These are expensive! I almost wasted more on Kim Hyung-woo or Hyung-guk. Wait a minute. Yeah, Kim Hyung-guk, not Kim Hyung-woo!

Why did you hit me? I can't see which way my spit went! Moron, there's your spit. That's it. I can get the footage from Cheol-sik. Why? Gonna hang yourself again? Yeah, you moron. I don't know where I'll go when my head goes cloudy, so tie this to your waist too! What if I need to poop? We'll pee and poop together. You got that? Let's go again! Mom!

Stop it! Mom, it's not a treasure hunt! Sorry about that. Give it. Go over there! Sorry. Can I put these back here? This is the only stop at this hour. It's no biggie. Starter motor's busted. 93:71, 78:81, 23:08, 26, 25:67. Ma'am, you can't doodle on that! Dirty, dirty! Ma'am! It's dirty! 11:55. All done! Finished! 11:55! 11:55! 11:55! 11:55! 11:55! What she was blabbering... wasn't the time of the crash. I've been working more hours. I got some debt from my mother's hospital bills. So I was doing a night shift when that woman came. That woman. Yeah, that woman. Santa Fe, 1155. 31D 1155 She said she hit a dog, but there was no fur, just some blood. I took her money and kept my mouth shut, but I wasn't able to sleep soundly ever since. One more thing. It felt so off that I wrote down her info, including her name, address, and VIN. Han Jae-sook, Santa Fe SM Osan, Gyeonggi Province... Han Jae-sook... Osan 31D 1155 Transmission, cross member... Completely replaced. KMHSD81VP, same VIN. Han Jae-sook, 406 - Hey, Du-won. - Cheol-sik... - It's really late. - Cheol-sik... Yeah, what's up? Cheol-sik... I got her... Got who? Bo-mi's hit-and-run driver! You did? Seriously? Her name is Han Jae-sook. She lives in Osan. I'm in front of her place now. Du-won, you can't just barge in there. We need to make an arrest with evidence. Wait, come to us with evidence at once! - Hey. - Du-won. Let me talk to Bo-mi. Bo-mi, Daddy wants to talk. Bo-mi, I caught the driver. Are you serious? I caught the driver who did this to you. You can get up now, go to the kindergarten, and go to fun places with me. We can have so much fun. Det. Kang Cheol-sik Yeah, Cheol-sik. What? Are you even human? Du-won, it's her! She's the one who hit your child! It's her! Cheol-sik, what's going on? That's Han Jae-sook. She turned herself in, and I brought her here so that she can beg for forgiveness. Turned herself in? For real? Yes. Can I borrow your lighter? You were here at the hospital. Why turn yourself in now? Sir, please calm down... How is he supposed to calm down? You try to calm down! I've searched for days on end. Why turn yourself in now? It was my fault, of course, but the kid is also at fault for running into the street. What did you say? So you left her to die on the street? You're a murderer! You thought you could live well after what you did to her? Geumsan Kindergarten, Class Cherry, 7-years-old! She's an innocent child who even forgave her granny who kicked her mom out! You know that? You are a killer! You could've at least taken her to the hospital! I came to turn myself in. Why, you! You thought you'd be okay after what you did to Bo-mi? I'm gonna kill you today! I'll kill you! - Let go of me! - Come on out! No! It's not her! Ouch, Auntie! That's more than enough. I'll take care of the rest. Madame, you're so strong. You'll bust my wrist! This woman hit my baby! If you're not gonna help, just stay back! It's not her! Then who is it? If only you didn't pull the plug! Step back. I'm gonna kill her! - I'll take care of this... - Come on out! Stop it, let go of me! Why did she hit me? Thanks to a father's love for her child, the hit-and-run driver of a 6-year-old child turned herself in like a miracle. Insurance loss adjuster Hwang tracked down the driver after an extensive search... Just jot it down. No need to go in detail. Dumpling. My dumpy. I caught the driver. You said you'd wake up if I caught her. Why are you still asleep? I'll be back. Stay right here. Abracadabra. Du-won! Welcome back! - Thank you. - How's Bo-mi? Well, she'll wake up soon. You did great work. Oh yeah. Here, this is Bo-mi's, and take a look at this. Mr. Kim from Daehan passed this along. Han Jae-sook was Mr. Kim's client. She's causing a lot of headache over there. He slipped us this document, so help them out when they sue her. Good, you did great work. Co-driver? It's not her! Then who is it? Hello, Mr. Kim. I'm Seoul Insurance's Hwang Du-won. There's something missing on Han Jae-sook's documents. Could you email it to me? Okay. Daehan Insurance: Han Jae-sook Claim Report Driver: Han Jae-sook Co-driver: Kang Cheol-sik Holy cow! Madame... What are you doing here? In Bo-mi's hospital room, it was you, Cheol-sik. Kang Cheol-sik! - What's going on? - Where did he go? He's taking a day off. - What is it? - They're in it together! - Excuse me! - Where's Han Jae-sook? Han Jae-sook! Han Jae-sook! Please calm down. Let go of me. I'm calm, I'm calm. Co-driver: Kang Cheol-sik You were the driver? Listen, Ms. Han Jae-sook! The thing about insurance is, once you confess that you did it, the insurance company isn't the one that will pay me. It'll come from your bank account! Claims aren't automatically handed out after crashes. Do your worse, then! I already turned myself in. What can you do with a piece of paper? I'll be suing you for damages with this piece of paper. It'll be me who decides how much to demand! Shall I leave you homeless? I guess Cheol-sik didn't tell you to have a ton of money ready. I'll milk you for everything you're worth. That's not all! I'll get you for hit-and-run, concealment of a crime, and a ton of traffic violations! Oh my gosh! Was it a person? Let's turn ourselves in. I'm so scared! Turn ourselves in? Why? Adultery, hit-and-run, and drunk driving. You wanna see me get sacked? Get it together! Auntie? Looks like she's sleeping... Auntie! Oh my! Your mom's gone! She put Pororo under the blanket. Check if Bo-mi has her Goblin Watch. The watch's gone! If I don't call back in about 20 minutes, call the police right away. Why are you making me do this to you? You always wanted to hang yourself. Take care. What did you do with my mom, you punk? So damn loud. Why are you asking me about your mom? She's probably trying to hang herself again. What the hell did he do with Mom? Back up, moron! That jerk. That's enough! You moron! Stupid jerk. Goddammit! Mom? What the hell? Poly, you okay? It hurts so much... Kang Cheol-sik, where are you going? You punk! Don't come after me! Where are you off to? My mom saw everything! You were the driver! Let go of me... You got Han Jae-sook. Isn't that enough? Let go! Will you stop? You were the one who hit my baby! Poly! My mom fixed this hand... Mom, we caught him. We caught the real perp... You lost... - Poly! - I'm the winner... You caught him? That's really great! The police sent something because they couldn't reach you. It's a piece of evidence provided by Han Jae-sook. They told me to hand it to you. Don't worry, I know him inside out, so I'll handle it. He's the biggest crazy I know. You know you can trust me. Yo, Kang Cheol-sik! I'm the winning crazy. You're the losing crazy! I'm a father who wins, you stupid jerk! Can't you move the tractor? It's blocking the path. Mom! Can you move the tractor? Are you cloudy again? Ang-ja, let's go! Come on, let's go move the tractor. Does it hurt a lot? It didn't hurt at all when you cut my finger off. You knew about that? Of course I knew. I didn't stay a cripple because of you. I'm truly sorry. I forced your wife out, made Bo-mi like that, and your finger too. It's all my fault. Drive straight. You're swerving! I should've died early. You should've forgotten it all and started anew. Forget what? Even if you forget everything, I'm gonna remember you, my mom, Mrs. Oh Moon-hee! How you cared for Bo-mi, how you fixed my finger, how you're sorry for what you did to Mi-sook! Good. Now you can finally live without me. Will you stop saying stupid things like that? Mom, you'll be fine. I'm gonna take care of you until the very end. Know how I feel? Ang-ja! Where have you been? You're swerving! Ang-ja! Come on! Daddy, Saint Oh's gonna die again! She climbed really high this time! Hurry, your mom's gonna die again. - What took you so long? - Bo-mi, hi. Did she go after your lice again? Why do you keep climbing to a high place? Mom! Do you know what this is? I don't know. I can't see! Special Guest: Hyun Sook Arabian Nights This is your insurance policy! Do you know what's written here? Don't know. Stop asking me! I'll read it for you, so listen carefully! If Oh Moon-hee dies from an injury or illness, a payout will be made, but none if she kills herself! That's what it says! You idiot, what's that got to do with me? Mom, I poured so much into this. You won't leave us anything? You're all talk about doing great things for your son. At least do something worthwhile! If I die from an illness, how much will it pay? Go high. If you die from an illness, it'll pay $50,000! - Wow, $50,000! - Nothing if you kill yourself! Isn't that what it says? Take a look. Ma'am! It's true what he said! It says not a damn thing if you kill yourself! You see? Damn, I can't even kill myself? Stupid goddamn saint... Fine! I won't kill myself! Bring me a ladder! Go in closer! It's snowing, Bo-mi! Give me your hand! Get the air cushion ready. Oh, dear! Poly! What brings you here? Oh, Mom! NA MOON-HEE LEE HEE-JUN CHOI WON-YOUNG PARK JI-YOUNG DIRECTED BY JUNG SE-KYO OH! MY GRAN
