Hey, honey, um, did you get the list from Ms. Collier? - Oh yeah, I've already done it. - Okay, great. - Of course, you have. - Really? - Girls! - I hear it all day. "Your sister is such a great student." "Oh, Emma just loves this book." Stace! Enough. So, I have a showing at 5. I'll be home at six-ish. Any dinner requests? Anything's good. Bye, mom. Bye, sweetie. I love you. She's the perfect girl, and I am the bad sister. No, you're not. Have a great day, honey. Bye. Breathe, Em. They're just probably gonna talk about stuff we already know. I mean, the only reason I'm going to scatter first period. We can get in a little late. Not really. Oh my dog, you're gonna exploded if you stay this tight. Speaking of tight. Hey, Emma. "Hey, Emma?" He fricking knows your name. - I guess. - Stephen Sullivan knows your name. - Hey, can we go to class now, please? - Look, could you sleep with him, please? For me. All right, listen up everybody. The bus will be leaving at 7 AM sharp tomorrow. So, be on time. Otherwise,-- Whoa! Sorry, Prom Queen. - Hey, you two, find a seat. - What? Let's go. I've expected from Mr. McMullen, but I hope better from you, Emma. - Sorry, Mr. Christiansen. - All right. So, tomorrow, the bus will be leaving at 7 AM sharp. All right? Be on time or the bus will be leaving without you. How did the lonely boy get on this trip? Daddy probably bought his way on. - Shh. - What? You know, I can hear you, right? For the first 5 days in Trinidad, we'll be helping to renovate the school with Project Humanity. The last 3 days, we'll be exploring the island and going on cultural excursions throughout the country, and it should be a lot of fun. So. Headline! Stephen knows Emma's name. Say what? Yeah, I trade you for your burger. You can have it. - You sure? - Yeah, I just want the fries. Okay, wait. So, Emma and Stephen? - I kind of like that. - Yeah. We have one week on the island to work our weavy magic and get young Emma here laid by the quaterback. - Do I have a say on this? - No. Not at all. - We're there to be helping people. - I'm trying to help you. We have jobs to do, Lizzie. - I have looked at the itinerary. - You made the itinerary. The school has every day and night planned. So, we'll change the plan. I mean, that's life, right? Oh! And BTW, I just found out that Carnival in Trinidad is when we're there. Oh, my God! I totally have to get a new bathing suits. Really? - What? - Emma's scoping "lonely boy". Oh. He was in my middle school. He used to be very nice. Yeah, "used to be". I heard he got kicked out of the last school he was in. No, I think he's kind of cute. In like a "Rebel Without a Cause", "Holden Caulfield" kind of way. Let me make it simple. Girls like our Em don't hook up with freak like what is his face? Especially, when the star quarterback's on hook. You can hand me that now. - Busted! - Yeah. You can follow me to the principal's office. Well then, lead the away. Oh, ho, ho, ho. Heh, heh, heh. Whoa! Well done. Looks like someone's not going on the trip. Well, folks, it looks like we're in for another cold... Wow! How long you're planning on staying? Ah... - You can never be too prepared, Phil. - Ah. Thank you guys so much for letting me go on this. No worry, sweetie. So what if I had to take the second mortgage out? Your mom may have to sell an extra mansion this month. - But,-- - Shh! Don't tell her that. Oh. I love our kids so much. Man! If this is what you two are like for eight-day trip, I don't want to know what's gonna be like to send her off to college. I know. So, I'm thinking we're gonna have to move to Princeton with you. I support that idea. - Right? - Yep. Wouldn't you love that? What are you talking about, you don't wanna go? All kind of strings I had to pull to get you back on this trip. For who, Dad? Me or you? Because I didn't even want to go on this stupid trip. 'Cause I'm gonna be forced to hang with a bunch of people I never talk to when I am here, anyway. It's an opportunity, son. It's a chance to do something for someone other than yourself. Can we go? We're gonna be late. I mean, if I'm stuck here, you'll have to look at my face all week. Let's go gang. All aboard. - Be careful. - Bye, Mom. - Love you. - Be safe, girls. Love you. Let's get a move. Come on. Dean! Be safe. We'll do, father. How are you doing, Emma? Crazy early, right? That was two sentences. He's upping his game. You're so getting laid. Okay. Everybody, listen up. Project starts tomorrow, which means... we have few hours today to get settled in and go hang by the pool if you want. Then, we're all gonna go to dinner. Ow! Woo! What did I tell you, Em? Screw your schedule. This is gonna be the best, ever. Mm, no locals. Damn. Oh, well. Who's the lucky boy? Don't worry, Em. I'm not gonna steal your quarterback. All right, ladies. Let's do this. One, two... Ah! You know what? Ah! Don't splash me. - Gotcha! - No. All right, man, good job. Spreading it on up. Hey, hey, hey. Be careful, up there. Whatever you say, boss. He's gonna get fricking killed and ruin it for all of us. You should get some more lotions on your shoulders. You'll have a burn. Day 2 and the first contact has been made. Yes, please. It's easier than I thought. Looks like Mama is getting some big action. Eh! Game on dude. - Skyping. - With the rentals. Okay. Get off, now. Seriously. It's urgent. Honey, are you all right? Um, uh, yeah. Um. Sorry, Ms. Collier is calling "lights out". All right, all right. Go ahead. We love you. Have fun. Get a good night sleep, babe. Love you guys. Bye. - Bye, honey. - Good night. Okay. So, I'm downstairs buying fricking toothpaste because I ran out. And can you believe they charge $5? - Losing. - Okay. Headline. Carnival party tonight on some local dude's boat. I know. And Stephen invited us. And he singled you out, young Emma. They're leaving right now, but the boat leaves in an half hour. - Uh, I don't know. - Shut it. We're going. You are going. Even if I have to tie you up and drag you to the boat. Seriously, we'll be done by midnight. Two o'clock, the earliest. - Okay. - Yeah! Come on. Come on. Want a taxi? Whoo! Go. Carnival bitches! Hurry, we're gonna miss it. Let's go, go, go. - Don't leave. - Woo! Run for it. ♪ Shorty wanna move Shorty wanna rock ♪ ♪ Shorty wanna dance Like it's never gonna stop ♪ ♪ 'Cause tonight We're gonna put it on blast ♪ This is so fun. - Hey, ladies. - No, no. That's okay. How do you do? - How old are you? - ♪ Shorty wanna rock ♪ ♪ Shorty wanna dance Like it's never gonna stop ♪ - ♪ 'Cause tonight... ♪ - Okay. Let's get a cocktail and find your man. Not my man and not drinking. Ugh, Em, you've got to loosen up. You need to switch around. Get out of your element. Just a little. I like my element. I'm gonna go find Helen. Is that your new boyfriend? What is it to you? Monte Carlo! Monte Carlo! Be prepared to be boarded. Monte Carlo, this is Trinidad police. Heave to and prepare to be boarded. Go to the front of the boat. Go to the front of the boat. Fuck! Monte Carlo, this is the Trinidad Police. - Emma! - Help. - What the hell are you doing? - Oh, what does it look like? I fell. Where's Emma? I, I don't know. I thought she was with you. Climb up. - You all right? - Just great. What are you doing? I'm in enough trouble. I can't get busted. Are you crazy? You think we're gonna dodge the cops? We'll be fine. We'll go back to the hotel when things cool down, okay? On this? I want to get back on the boat. They're getting too far away. We just hang back then we'll follow. - We'll be fine. - Hurry. We won't be able to see the boat. - How are we gonna get out of here? - I'm working on it, alright? - Do you even know which way to go? - Be quiet. Let me think. - Damn it! No motor. - No motor? What now, genius? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? We're stuck out here in the middle of nowhere. This isn't some stupid little thing about-- - Ah! - What? Hold on! Please, put your suitcases by the door to be loaded into the waiting cabs. And I specially like to thank those of you who brought this unique opportunity to an abrupt end. Welcome, gentlemen. Glad you could make it. Too bad, you're on your way home. Um, Ms. Collier. Emma's not here. What? Um... She never came home last night. And I didn't tell anyone because I thought, you know, she was with someone or something, but I really-- Well, how do you know she's not? You know her, Ms. Collier. She wouldn't just bail. She has a schedule to keep. And I try her cell and she's not answering. All right. Well, uh, where did you see her last? - Um. - Ahem. On the boat. How far do you think we've drifted? I don't know. Just keep an eye out. Can't be that far. We've been out here for hours. Is this part of your brilliant plan? I can't believe my phone got totally soaked. Yeah, I can't believe that either. Try your phone again. Uh, I told you, I'm not getting reception out here. You want some more water? Thanks. I can't believe you brought water to a party. I didn't want to get dehydrated. That's what gives you a hangover. Really? I thought it was tequilla. I still can't believe there's no motor. I mean, that's the point of the dinghy, right? For emergencies. Or else, who has to do the dinghy? How is that funny? Dinghy is funny. It's a funny word. Dinghy. We're floating in the middle of the Caribbean. You know that right? Yeah. And I also know that, freaking out... is not gonna make us any less screwed. So-- So, what do we do? For now... We float. I guess. Oh. I brought some gum. Why? Is my breath bad? Probably. Elizabeth Kover? Here. Samuel Liefer? Here. Dean McMullen? Dean? Dean McMullen? Has anyone seen Dean? Woo! You should try that. No, thanks. You want me to get your back? What's stocked in ziplocs? What? You carry all your crabs in baggies? I keep things from getting messy. How's that working out for you? At least, my phone is dry. We should have followed the Police boat back to shore. What? With this single paddle? - Sure. - I'm just saying. Okay. First of all, I figured we would be able to row back in later. And second of all, unless we forget Prom Queen, you were the one who decided to take a moonlight deep... - in the stormy water. - I fell off the boat. And my name is Emma. Okay, Emma. Oh my God! What? Island. - There. - Where? Right there. Okay. That's way too far. Just sit here until someone picks us up. Are you kidding? Fine, I'll paddle. Okay, okay. I'll paddle. - Jeez! - Come on. She never made back to the hotel last night? - No, and I thought that maybe she-- - Was she drinking? What does that have to do with anything? - Was she with Dean? - What? No. But, he was on the boat? Yeah. But, she, she didn't meet anyone, and she wasn't hooked up with Dean. - Ms. Collier, how can we just-- - Can anything be done to find them? More than likely, they'll find you. You know, this type of things isn't interpreted uncommon. It's the youthful spirit of adventure. No, this is my best friend we're talking about. I know her. She has no youthful spirit of adventure. Dean! All right. You OK? Yeah. You? Yeah. Think so. No coverage. We'll have to find a phone. Great. Wait up. Come on. Really? Who's that for? I don't know. Shoot the bad guys? Now, you finish it. Use Coffee. Like the Mocha ice blended with an extra shot. Oh, man! How good would that be? What was that? I hate bugs. Well, you come to the right place then. Let's just find the hotel. We're supposed to finish working on the school today. I bet everyone is probably all worried about us. You, maybe. I can promise you, nobody is worried about me. Yeah, this is Jack. I'm sorry, what? Excuse me. - Mrs. Robinson? - Barbara. Jack McMullen. - I'm Dean's father. - Nice to meet you. What were they doing on the boat in the first place? And who was watching them? - Now, Mrs. Robinson. - Don't condescend to me. Don't you dare condescend to me. I trusted you with our daughter. They can't find her. Oh, it's, it's okay. We'll find her. When is the next flight? There's Redeye tonight from Miami. Then make a connection in Trinidad. - There's none earlier flight? - No, that's the earliest there is. I can help you with, with some arrangement-- No, you've done enough. Thank you. Let's go... Uh, my feet are killing me. I fricking hate hiking. You want one of my chucks? That's okay. Thanks, though. Hey, look. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. What? They're berries. White and yellow kill fella. Purple and blue good for you. You're little bit weird. You know that, right? Been called worse. Oh, my-- Wow. It's beautiful. Come on. We got to keep going. - Let's just find the hotel. - What? We may never get back here again. Come on. Take a picture. We are already in enough trouble. You know, they grade this trip. I can not mess up my GPA. Hello? Do you know how unique this is? Okay. What's your number one school? Princeton. Why? You know how many people apply for Princeton have a 4.0? A lot. You know how many people had been swimming in this waterfall? Think of the essay you can write. Come on. We got to find the hotel. So lame. Fine. See, this is why I don't hang out with people. I can't wait til we get to the real bathroom. I can't wait for a coffee. Where are we? We've been walking for hours. We have not seen a single road. Person. We better get back to the boat. Come on. It's gonna be a long walk. What if we have to spend the night on this island? I don't think we're gonna find a 5-Star hotel around here. Do you know how to make a fire? I do. Ta da! Perfect. What? A cave? - I am not sleeping in a cave. - It's the safest place to be. Dry if it rains. Only one way in. Protection from the elements. Hey, can I use your phone? Sure. There's no signal. I am not a cave person. None of us are cave persons. We haven't been cave people for a long-- Whoa! Go, go, go, go, go! So... That's a "NO" on the cave. Where's the boat? I'm really tired. Can we take a break soon? Sure. Thanks. You see something? No. Use the flare gun. You need at least two flares. I saw on the book. I think, it was the one with the... girl who sailed around the world with her cat. You suppose to fire two flares. One to get their attention and the other so... they try to locate you. Who is "they"? The people that are gonna come get us, I guess. Our families and the police and whoever. Dean, what are you doing? What was that about? Hey, can I borrow some of that bugs stuff? - Sure. - Thanks. You want a pillow? Thanks. - Wait a second. - What? Ahah. Damn, you should be on that "Price Is Right" show. I knew it was in here. I put it in there in case I got hungry when we were building yesterday. Thanks. And I think you meant, "Let's make a deal". Hm? Oh! Right. That show. Here's some more. Thanks. Flight 415 from Detroit to Miami scheduled to depart at 11:00 PM, is now expected to depart at 12:10 AM, from gate 211. We're gonna get there. Why do you call me "Prom Queen"? Aren't you? No. You seem like you should be. Perfect girl, perfect world. I can't tell if you're being mean or nice. What do you think is out there? In the woods? We're gonna be fine. I know. - Still can't get the signal. - Here. What, what are you doing? You just waste the battery. Just play some music. Oh. Here. Take my shirt. Thank you. Sure. Good night. Good night. They'll come for us. I know it. What was that? Hey! You're morning person, huh? What are you doing? I'm trying to save us. What are you doing? I don't know. Might go for a swim. Hey, where is your phone? The battery is dead. We need some more water. The police have a boat searching the area where they picked up the kids. - As soon as they come back... - And when will they be back? When is that? Ah, I'm not sure. They said they would let us know when they-- - Mm-hm. - Any word? I was just telling Barbara... that the police have a boat searching the Caribbean right now. They did say that the dinghy was missing. So-- - Well, how long have they been looking? - And what about the helicopter? Uh, they said as soon as the wind dies down, they're gonna send someone up. Have they been searching the land as well as water? Have you contacted the Embassy? Is there a private team we can hire? - Becase money is not an issue. - I, I understand. No. The police are doing everything that they can with the limited resources that they have on the island. There is no private rescue team. But, they did say that they're very very confident that they are going to find Dean and Emma. The first 48 hours is the most important. But, the chief of police said that, you know, kids do this-- Oh, God! If I hear one more time that this is what kids do. - Are you kidding me? - It has been almost two days. What the hell are these people doing? Except offering antic dodo craps about the teenagers. Huh? All right, look, I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. Help us find our children. The hut is gonna be something in case of rain, you know? Rain? You never know. Ah! Ow! - Oh, are you okay? - Ow. Come here. This may sting a little. Does that hurt? Now, keep the pressure on it. So? Why Princeton? Huh? Why do you want to go to Princeton? I don't know. It's Ivy League. It's just... what we talk about me going. It's kind of weird, right? It's always been... where I wanted to go. Where I suppose to go. I don't think I ever even question it. Mm. Yeah. They're not gonna give up. No. They'll come. For you. Thanks guys. Prepare to board in 5 minutes. I'm sorry. Did you find her? Uh, not yet. But, we will. Yeah. We're, we're, we're gonna go back out tomorrow. Uh, sweetie. Your, your mom and I are gonna need to stay few more days. Is that okay? Sure. Stay however long you need. There we go. That should hold for a bit. Seriously? Okay. Now, it's good. Celebration swim? Come on. Come on. It's like a million degrees. We earn it. Ah, ah! I cannot eat any more fruit. Hey, Prom Queen! Don't look! I'm just gonna ask you if you have any sunscreen left. I don't have anymore of anything left. You can look for yourself. The bottles are in the baggies. They're piled in the hut. I looked for them. Didn't see any. They're there. But, they're empty. I am sure there is some Aloe somewhere. Now, turn around and stop looking. You know that every time you say that, it reminds me that I should be looking. I am serious. You're the one who asks me to be here and stand guard. There's something out there. I can hear it at night. This afternoon, according to the officials, the investigation has been downgraded... from a search and rescue to a search and recovery effort... as hope of finding the pair alive has faded. You've to call me every day. Or even twice a day if you can, okay? I will. I promise. I just hate the idea of leaving you alone down here. I'll be fine, honey. You've gotta go back. Stacey needs one of us there. Especially, now. I know, I know. You're right. Well, it's official. They call off the rescue research. You see what this is, Barb? They don't have resources down here. That's what it is. For the families and the students back home... who have kept constant... I am not gonna stop, Phil. I promise, I'll, I'll bring her back home. I know you will. I know you will. Jack, thank you for hiring this. We keep covering these waters. We still have two hours of flying time. I miss my mom and dad. I even miss my little sister. And my fish. The smell of my sheets when they first get out of the dryer. I bet they're still looking for us. They have to be, right? You think they quit? Would you? I mean, keep looking for something, at some point... you figure is gone, right? Why you do this? Watch the sunset every day? Just looking for something. What? Nothing. It's stupid. The Zippo is dead. We've gotten to learn to make our own fire now. Oh! What is it? Oh, my God! How long you think he was there? How long you think that he pretended... that he was gonna make it home? This guy is not us, Em. He could have been some local fishman or... a drug smuggler, or anyone. You got people out there who love you. People looking for you. And you know what else? We got each other. That's something right there, Prom Queen. We're gonna be okay. You hear me? Nothing bad is gonna happen to you. Why are you crying? That was... That felt so good. You make that sound like a bad thing. It's just... For a while, I forgot where we were. I pictured us home. Worrying about what everybody was gonna say. I felt so normal. Hey, where is my laté? I'm going to the lagoon. Dean, did you take the big water bottle? Dean? Dean? Dean? Dean! - Why would you do that? - Do what? Leave me there without saying where you were going, or... You were sleeping. And I woke up and you were nowhere. What are you doing? He deserves to be buried. Okay? At least have a funeral. Dean, I don't, I don't understand. What--? Talk to me. I'm... - I'm here. And-- - Here and what? We had sex once. We're stuck on the island. We're not soulmates. That's mean. Yeah. I am not a nice guy, Emma. Now, you know. I don't believe that. Whatever it is, I'll, I'll listen. Please, just give me-- Ah! Emma! I'm so sorry, Emma. I didn't mean to-- It was an accident. I fell. I don't know what I'd do if something happened to you. What are we doing? We're not some happy couple on an island vacation. How are we gonna make it day after day? Just two of us. What if something goes wrong? I mean... what if I broke my leg? Or one of us gets sick or something like that? Nobody knows what's out there, Em. There're stuffs all the time that we don't know how to deal with. And... we just gotta figure it out. I didn't go to my mom's funeral. That's why I want to bury that guy. Just flesh. Ashes to ashes. I thought, maybe, seeing... seeing him get underground and all that would make things make sense. Did it? Not really. I guess that's the point. It doesn't always make sense. We need hydrotherapy. And you're kinda stink. So... Step into my office and tell me about your problems, Mr. McMullen. I couldn't handle seeing... seeing... all of it. You know, the casket, and all the people pitying me. Blaming me or-- Why would they blame you? Because I killed her. She was driving me home from soccer practice. We were driving down the side road. And it was dark. And we used to play this game when it was snowing, where... where she flicked on the highbeams on and off. And it looked like we were going to a hyperspace... from like a Star War movie or something like that. I reached over trying to be funny, trying to be like her. She lost control of the car. We were laughing and next thing... I was in the hospital for 3 days. When I got out, she was gone. You didn't kill her. Well. You should, maybe, think about moving here. Nice neighborhood.

Even if it's just for her body or something. Wow, Helen, that's kind of morbid. Her mom is still there. Maybe, she'll find her. I know that we've been over this. But, if you would just look at the new information, regarding the, the weather patterns on the night of the party, you would see that we've been looking at the wrong place. Mrs. Robinson. I've seen this information. Perhaps, your embassy can-- I've been to the embassy, twice. Excuse me. Have you seen these two? Sorry folks. No plane's taking off today. They say the storm could last for days. Yep. When my wife died, I... I tried it so hard to keep her here, you know? Keep her alive. I almost lost everything I had. Dean and I barely spoke. I almost lost my partnership with the firm. I was so focused on what I lost, I forgot what I had. Maybe, it's time you go home, Barbara. And... it's not like we haven't tried. It's tough call. Whenever we were on the beach, my mom used to talk about the green flash. My dad and I would watch and watch. I've never seen it. It's supposed to be right on the horizon line. Just as the sun comes down. I'm thinking, maybe, it's just a thing... people believe in... to make them feel like there's something out there, you know? Beauty or whatever.

Was that okay? I mean... was I okay? Emma... you are so much better than okay. Okay? If "OK" is around here somewhere, you are way over the damn palm trees. If "OK" is like a tiny grain of sand, you're the whole beach. If "OK" is like a little drop of water, you're like the whole fricking Caribbean. You want me to go on? Okay. You were never like this at school. Like what? I don't know. Fun. You're different too. No, I'm not. Yeah. You kind of are. How so? No posse, no books. I used to watch you sometimes. That sounds creepy. You always seemed like you had a plan. Like you had something to do or... somewhere to go. I guess, now you have nowhere to go, huh? I can't believe I'm saying this, but... I kind of like where I am. And for the record, I watched you sometimes too. Who was your first time? Oh, we're playing that game. Yeah, we are. Who? I was a sophomore. And she was a junior Do I know her? No, she's in college. I don't know. I thought she could teach me some stuff. Was it fun? All 5 minutes were a blast. Okay. Who was your first? Mm. No, no, no. No, no, no, no. No. I told you mine. Now, you have to tell me yours. Football player? Band geek? - Teacher? - You. What? You. Me? I was your--? Wow! Wow! Is that the bad "wow"? No. Just a "wow". Wow. Was it okay? I got sand in some weird places. I'm glad it was me. Me too. So... since this is all pretty new to me, maybe, we should practice some more. Yeah. Emma, did you hear that? Plane! Get the flare gun, I'll catch up with you! No, no, no. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! They were too high. Did you fire both flares? I didn't see. No, I couldn't find the gun. What do you mean you couldn't find the gun? It's in the same place as it's always been. This is our chance, Dean. I don't understand. Where it should be? - Did you move it? - No. You're the only one who ever picked it up. Oh. So, you're saying I lost it. I'm not saying anybody lost it. I'm just saying it's not there. Someone's been taking our stuffs. The baggies and my lotions and... my sunscreen and toothpaste. That stuff ran out a long time ago. Yes. But, I kept the bottles. I used them for Aloe and for water and-- Where is the water bottle? I don't know. It's probably here somewhere. I bet you're just organizing things mundane. Oh. What? Really? Organizing? That's what happens? I organize too much. Hang on. - Emma, Emma! - Get off me! - What are you doing? - I'm leaving. I can't, I can't do this. I do not stay on this island anymore. What you're gonna do? Swim back? Emma! Hello! There's no-one out there, is there? Hello! We've seen one plane since we've been here. I'm never gonna see my family again. We'll be better off in there. Long term. What's "long term", Dean? Look, Em. At some point, we're gonna have to say: "This is it." This is our life, you know? Just you and me. You hear that? It's nothing. It's just the wind. I'm gonna find whatever it is and make it stop. Dean. No. Dean? Dean!

Put, put it down. Put the gun down and step away from the vehicle. Come on, monkey. Drop the gun. No, no, no, no, no. Stop, stop! Stop! Put it down! Come on, little guy. I... I trade you a banana for the gun. He didn't even take his banana. You know what? What the hell? What'd you do that for? I don't wanna hope anymore. You're acting like you're a crazy person. - Why did you fire-- - Oh, I'm a crazy person? No, see. Crazy is thinking that... we can survive for more than a year on this stupid island. That's crazy. We're gonna make a life here, Em. It's gonna be better. I promise. No noise. I mean, what's so good out there anyway, right? Life, Dean. Life is what so good out there. Our families, our everything. See, you're crazy if you think, for one second, that I would actually choose to live like this. This is not "living". This is "surviving". Any luck? No. I never say "thank you". For what? For saving me. For being there. Here. Emma. - Hey! - Hey! Hey! - Where is it? - Here. Okay, you shoot. Load and shoot, Em!

They said we don't have to go back to school right away. Yeah, I know. I think I'm gonna go next week though. If I can do it. Of course, you are. What does that mean? Nothing, just-- I guess, summer is over, huh? You're talking in code? My dad told me about your party. My mom is throwing it as a homecoming thing. Are you gonna come? All kids from school will be there. It will be fun. Yeah, fun. You should probably go. My mom and dad have been checking on me like every ten minutes. Sure. Come to the party, okay? Uh, first of all, thank you guys so much for coming It's special day for us. Um... I can't imagine the courage you took... to survive those days. I really can't. But, I'm so grateful that you did. To my girl... And to Dean. Where's, where is Dean? Behind you. I can not thank you enough. You kids really are an inspiration to us all. I mean that. - To Emma and to Dean. - To Emma and to Dean. - Whoa! - Woo, woo! - Whoa! - Yes. - Hi. - Hi. - Thank you for coming. - Thanks so much Barbara. Thank you. How come you're not over there with everybody else? I am not really "everybody else" kind of guy. Emma is. Always has been. She's really good at that. People really like her. Yeah, I can see that. Did you see any sharks? It took her like... two seconds to become even more popular than... before you guys went away. Yeah, I can see that too. I think the memoirs'd be best. But, you know what? I would remember when I see you. They're calling it "the miracle at sea".
