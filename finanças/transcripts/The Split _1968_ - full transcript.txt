Hello, Gladys. McClain. Oh! Come on in. You hungry? I'll order food. Um-m-m. Want some more noodles? - I'm looking for Ellie. - She moved. - Find her for me-- - I haven't seen her. What if she doesn't want to be found? I'll work it out. You? Oh, what about work? What do you want to do? Just one big job. That's all I want. Need a place to stay. Oh! [romantic music] (Ellie) Why did you come back? (McClain) I told you I would. Didn't you believe me? I kept on dreaming. Then one morning I woke up you weren't there. That was the one morning too many. You're not here now, McClain. If I'm not here, what the hell were you just doing? You never hit me before. It felt great! I missed you, Ellie. - Swell, Mac. - Said I missed you. You didn't miss me enough to come home, did you, Mac? Wanted to come back with more than six bucks I had. Well, you know I would have settled for the six bucks. You filed the papers. I didn't. That's right. And don't you never forget it. You opened that front door fast enough. Oh, Mac! (Ellie) 'I'm weak with you.' That's an entirely different problem. That's my problem. 'And what did I do?' I married. That was the only thing you ever did that you really wanted. Wrong. There were two things. The second was divorcing you. Now there is a third. What's that? Telling you to get the hell out of here and never come back. What are you waiting for, Mac? You wanna see me crawl. You wanna see me feel so cheap that I can't stand it anymore. Why did you come back? Why? You black son of a bitch! You had the whole world to mess up! Why me? Are you gonna stay this time, Mac? Is that supposed to give me some kind of hope? Baby. - How's Ellie? - Ah, she's fine. - Where are we going? -You're going to the Coliseum. I read in the paper there's a tie for first place. - Between who? - It doesn't matter. Then why am I going? 'There's a playoff next week.' No advance sale or box office and the tickets run between $5 and $7.50. There's 80,000 seats in the place. And that's a lot of money. [cars honking] To get in, you have to buy a ticket. [people chattering] Thank you. (male #1) Program's here. Program's here. [indistinct chatter] Hike! [crowd cheering] (commentator #1) '...touchdown for the Los Angeles Labs.' 'Rick Lasso holding.

Incomplete.' [crowd cheering] (commentator #1) 'The official rule of the play down.' 'Rams is through with the ball.' 'And the Los Angeles Rams, beats the Atlantic Falcons' '20 to 3.' Well.. Can you do it? You know I can do it. [phone rings] Good morning. Gymorama. One moment please. Mr. Clinger? Line three, please. I got you, honey. A-ah! I hear you're quite athletic. Phone's disconnected anyway. The gun in our desk is unloaded. Now, wait just a minute, chief. You've made a big mistake. Erase me. Oh. Uh-oh. [pounding on door] Let me in. Mr. Clinger? Mr. Clinger? What the hell was that all about? Hey! I always pay you, don't I? I wanna make a lousy $100 bet. That's all. [phone ringing] I got somebody on the other line. Just hold on a second, will you?

I'm freezing to death. It kind of warm.. Don't you think it's kind of warm? [laughing] Well you see I had asthma when I was a kid and I catch a cold real easy. Listen baby, if you're gonna catch anything from me it's not gonna be a cold. I'm gonna catch that thick, one-eyed bird. [both laugh] (Marty) Wow. Oh, it's dark in here. [step breaks] 'Oh...Jeez.'' - Hey, where are you? - Your birdie is down here. (Marty) You got eyes like a pussycat. Meow. Come and get me. (Marty) Darn, I lost my shoe. Oh, what do you need the shoe for? (Marty) I told you I catch a cold easy. You don't need that. [both laughing] (Marty) What the hell's your name anyway? - Girl girl. - Girl girl? [both laughing] Give her a little kiss kiss. - Wait a minute. I can't see. - Relax. (Marty) Man, it's dark in here. You do have eyes like a cat. Okay, oh yeah. You like that? Let me see your scar? [both laughing] Put your leg over here. Put your foot right there. - Where? - Right there. Don't thank me. You're gonna love it. Stay right there. [footsteps] The man said if you really know your business, you'll get out all right. Goodnight, Marty. What are you, some kind of a nut? I won't give you.. What the hell you know about that? [doors closing] What kind of a woman would do a thing like that to you? You aint gonna leave me in here to suffocate. One, two, three! I know a thing or two. One, two, three! What the.. I'm on the move, baby. [laughing] [door closes] Park it, Charlie. Very good, Mr. Negli. I'll get right to it. [gunshot] Okay, Gladys. I know who I want. Negli, Kifka, Clinger and Gough. I'll set up a meeting for tomorrow afternoon. And Gladys, make sure they know what happened to them. Tested? Ha.. Tested for what? Look, I don't know about these other guys, Gladys 'but I'm a little too old for audition.' You better believe that, sweetheart. Somebody's gonna pay for the limousine, the TV and the bar. - It's not like you paid for it. - What do you mean? Wait a minute. Money, cars. I could have died. [all argue] Shut up. Shut up! [all arguing] He blows my cover, that blows my life. You crawl under the rug you just came from. - You're like.. - Don't touch! Go ahead, pull the trigger. I'm a dead man anyway. Who the hell is he? He's a big, black idiot. I have no time in my life for a smart ass nigger. Why don't you shut your mouth? Look, let's talk about the $500,000 we're going to take. We're gonna what? Say it again, Gladys. They're listening now. $500,000. Whoo! One half a million. - Split, six ways. - Where's six? - Count us. - I did. I only counted five who were sticking their necks out. Gladys finances this and she gets a full share. Any objections? Let's hear them now. What's the matter? $85,000 aint enough to buy silver bullets for your big gun? You're a funny man. Be sure you don't die laughing. Knock it off the two of you. Go ahead. The money comes into the finance office all through the game. - How? - Armed guards in pairs. - Where you going? - Out. All the way. You're walking out on $85,000? I don't like who I'm working with. I'm talking about you. Money is green. Alright, that's it. The party's over. - Now wait a minute. - Let him go. You can pick up creeps like him dime a dozen. He knows. Either we're all locked in or none of us are. He's locked in. - Like hell I am. - Marty. The last man I killed for $5000. For $85,000, I'd kill you 17 times. Now come on, sit down. Alright, let's get back to it. When the money gets inside it's stacked and counted. - Then we're in and out? - Wrong. We're in quick enough, but not out. We'll leave near the end of the game, at the two minute warning. You've blown your cork. Look, concession money comes in the last quarter. 'and that's almost as much as the game.' - When do we cut up the pie? - Next day. We'll keep it some place where one of us can watch it. And the rest of us can watch him. You sure as hell aren't keeping it at my place. I'll take care of the money. Not a good idea, huh? Sleep with your own evidence. Next time I'll see any of you boys is at clingers'. - Ellie, she's straight. - Who's Ellie? - She's McClain's. - You trust McClain? Can't take a chance with any of you. You clowns all have records. Ellie's clean. And the cops here have nothing on McClain. - Yeah. - We'll be watching you McClain. Well, just don't look in that window or I'll blow your face off. * Don't you know it's just a game, love * * It's make believe * * Except for real love * Don't you know it's just a game, love * * That's why you got * * To really be loved * Can't you see.. * I have to change my address.

Are you McClain? Yes, I am. Gladys said wonderful things about you. Come on back to the stock room. I put them aside. It's hard to keep track how many little boys does Gladys have now. There's five of us and we'll need 15 clips. [music] It's alright. It's not wired. [door unlocks] Oops. That's hot. Uh-huh. That's it. Give me another light, right there. - How's that? - Okay. Somebody press that button out there. (McClain) Move it. - The alarm turns next, right? - Right. [clattering] (McClain) Sit him up. Sit him up. [Marty groaning] Sit him up. What the hell is wrong with him? - What, is he a junkie? - He's having an asthma attack. 'I told you we should have let him go.' (McClain) It's okay, Marty. Thanks. I'm fine. [indistinct chatter] (female #2) You see my little girl was just three. Of course. So that now she's going to nursing school, she has to.. - My son-- - Hey, look out! [screaming] Come on. Come on. Get in there. Don't do that. Now, don't anybody move or turn around. Until you've been told to. - There's no money in here. - There will be. Now everybody do just as you're told. On Monday morning the football association will be filing a big, fat insurance claim. One wrong move and your next of kin will be on the beneficiary list. Alright, drop your hands slowly. Now turn around. Nothing else. [Dave laughing] When do you check the alarm system? Whenever the guard post phoned us. What time? - What time? - Eleven. [telephone ringing] Who the hell is supposed to answer that phone? It ends for us, it ends for you too. [ringing continues] It's not him. Maccione. Uh, you all ready? Okay. Just a minute. [whispering] Now, do it right. Okay. The cage. [clicks] The window. [clicks] The floor. [clicks] Alright. That does it. Yeah. Okay. Now, move away from it. Two seven and a half, please. 'Thank you.' [indistinct chatter] Okay. - One, please. - Two in the shade. One dollar, sir. One dollar. [people chattering] [buzzer buzzes] [buzzer buzzes] (male #2) Hey, man, you sure got a long face today. 'Count that money and cheer yourself up.' I didn't get much sleep last night, Shelly. 'You have to be around time tonight, okay?' Yeah. Leave. - What about that, huh? - Hey, man, it worked. Hey, I bet there's nine grand in there. [people chattering] One dollar. One dollar. (commentator) 'And there is the kick-off.'

Hey, can I take a smoke? It's bad for your health. Go ahead. [door buzzes] [commentary on radio] - Look at this. - What? That bum made a 35 yard run against them. For crying out loud. Come on, give me a hand, will you? (commentator) '...five minutes left in the game.' Let's go. Move them down the corner. Come on ladies, let's go. - Tie them up. - Right. You, sit down. [commentary on radio] Press the button. [siren wailing] [engine sputtering] [siren wailing] All of them lined up. They had to win. [buzzer buzzing] I think something's wrong, man. - Wait here. I'll get help. - All right. [siren wailing] They were five of them. - 'You alright?' - 'They just took off.' They're dressed as ambulance attendants. Just now. [siren wailing] [honking] [honking continues] You're beautiful. [knock on door] Hi, baby. Come here. I'm glad you're back. I'm sorry about where you've been. - Where have I been? - All over television and radio. There were no names. But the style, that was unmistakable. You're using me, Mac. How much did you get? Oh, Mac. [phone ringing] (Ellie) Hello? It's for you. I know. Did you, uh... Did you count it? Yeah, roughly. It's more than we figured. Oh! Ho-ho. Too bad we didn't take the coins. Next time, we'll figure it better. - Yeah, you do that. - Yeah. Hey, where do we split? Be at Ellie's. I'm not going to carry that stuff around town. Fine, fine. Oh, listen. The others will want her out of there, before they get there. You know what I mean? Yeah, you just be at Ellie's place at 11. Okay. Hello, Ms. Kennedy. I just wanna talk to you for a minute. Your rent is in the mail Mr. Sutro. Oh, it's gotta be more rent. Can't we talk about that tomorrow? I'm expecting someone now. Yeah, I know. What? Well...that I've been watching. I bet you have. You wanna talk about raising the rent? Or you want me to call the cops and have you thrown outta here? Just tell me what I have to pay and go. Well.. Two people.. ...new rent. That's all. Why don't we talk about that tomorrow? No. I want to talk about it right now. Uh-huh. You go. You live here rent-free. You know that. You get out of here. No. Listen to me. He'll kill you. No...No you see I just-- Please Mr. Sutro. Please. No...No! No please! Oh! Hell, if he does come back look what I got now. Please. That thing might go off. - Please. - Oh, please! Please.. Please! [softly] Please. Please! Please. [gun firing] [breathing heavily] I-I want to report a murder. Murder. Yes. 1205 Longman's Avenue. Apartment four. Ellie? Hey, baby.. Hey. [music] [knocks on door] [knocking continues] - Who is it? - 'Police.' She's in there. Are you the one that called it in? - Yes, I am. - Who was she? Her name was Ellie Kennedy. What's your name? Ow! [gunshot] - Can I sell you a membership? - Sell me Clinger! [intercom buzzing] Move and I'll blow your head off. What the hell are you doing? Our money has been stolen. Convince me you didn't set it up. What? Convince me. - Who do you think you are? - Get her out. You better have something really important to say, McClain. I hope she's free 'coz you don't have the money to pay for her. Now you talk straight McClain. What do you want? I want you to prove you don't know what I want. The money? Five hundred and forty eight thousand dollars. Plus one fine lady. Are you trying to tell me that she ran over that money? That lousy bitch.. She's dead. You owe me that money, McClain. You make it good or I'll leave you in shreds. Somebody owes me more than you've got. You've humiliated me, McClain. (Dave) You were responsible for that money. You lost it. Now you find it. - Let's talk about it. - Yeah. Let's talk about it. That's right. Let's all talk about it. I was with you when the girl got hit. And if one of these scum did it. Let's find out right now. Hey, what are you guys tryin' to pull? Some kind of 50-50 split here? [indistinct arguement] As you can see. You're on the spot boy. Look we gotta work this thing out. Okay, what's your story? - No talkin'! - 'Put way the gun.' 'I hope you find the money McClain.' - I do still like you. - I don't. You see that Gladys? He's crazy. Should've killed him. Long time ago. No...Let him find the money first. I still think he's got it. What's the matter? Are you afraid of him? (male reporter) 'Police reported last night. The discovery of' 'the machine gunned body of Ms. Ellen Kennedy, 27.' 'In the bedroom of her apartment at 1205 at Longman's Avenue.' 'Detective Walter Brill is in charge of the investigation'' 'The doors have not been forced. Personal articles were found.' 'Belonging to the alleged killer in the apartment.' 'From New York our correspondent reports the trading was brisk.' 'When the market opened this morning.' 'The average showed an increase of five points.' Pull the string. You busted in the wrong place this time, buddy. 'I'm a police officer.' Yeah. Walter Brill, detective, third grade. I haven't got what you're looking for. Whatever the hell that may be. And who are you? Not a chance. Nobody in the force will rest if anything happens to one of their own. Nothing's gonna happen. What do you want? Spit it out! You curl up pretty fast for a cop, don't you? - 'I want information.' - What kind? I was in Ellie Kennedy's apartment when those cops got there. The boyfriend. - 'She died ugly.' - I know how she died. And that's what's pushing you on, huh? 'You wanna get the man that killed her.' Yeah, that's right. Crap. Money! Over a half a million dollars from that stadium heist. 'We found a money band stuck in her dresser.' I know the boys in the robbery are waiting for you right around the next corner Mr. Boyfriend. You know you've been third grade a long time. 'Bringin' in this killer will put you on top of the world.' So toss me in the middle and let me make waves. 'And you get the parade.' And all you want is just a half a million dollars. All right. Interview is over. Names now. - Why not? There's only one. - 'Give it.' Sutro. Spell it out. S-U.. [gun loads] Your girlfriend's landlord. You've made a fool of me McClain. I could kill you with the greatest of ease. Detective Walter Brill. I'm sorry about Ellie. I want my money McClain. [dramatic music] We want our money McClain. I don't have it. Well then, where is it? Huh? I don't know. You never took the money to the girl's place did you? Of course you didn't. The person that killed Ellie-- What're you tryin'? The paper says the landlord killed Ellie. And the cop Brill, killed the landlord. 'It don't say nothin' in here about any money.' Not a thing. They didn't find it at your girlfriend's. Or the landlord's. The cops didn't find it. 'Nobody found it.' - 'Cause you got it. - Aah! [laughs] Oh, I'm gonna have a ball breaking you McClain. He's not gonna be able to tell anything if you keep that up. Oh, I don't know. He's a pretty strong fella. Aren't you McClain? I don't want you dead. You're a real friend Gladys. Thanks a lot. It was your idea to stash that money at Ellie's. - Wasn't it? - Hey.. ...that's right. It was. - So what? - Gladys, maybe you've got it. Shut up! That mind of yours, it never stops working, does it? This was the biggest thing that ever happened for me. Don't cheat me out of it. 'Where is it, McClain? Please tell us.' Don't make me watch them do this to you. If I was you, baby, I'd turn my back. Drag him over here, boys. Oh, I had so much for you. Drag him over. [screaming] [Gladys screaming] [dramatic music] Put that gun down. Damn fool, you'll have every cop in the city here. [tires screeching] [steam hissing] He comes up to me and says.. Alright, let's get to it, buddy. Then he hits me right in the mouth. See. Know his name? He just hauled off and punched me. Look. Look at the bridge in my mouth. Listen, that'll cost me. Now who's gonna pay.. [phone ringing] Come on. I didn't come here to write a book.. Hello? You'll have to call the animal shelter for that, lady. Yeah, that's right. [phone ringing] (male #4) 'Hello? Hello?' 'Yeah, that's right.' [people chattering] - Who's gonna pay for-- - Hold on there, mister. It's okay. I know my way. Machine crystal used by Herbert Sutro was found in Ellen Kennedy's apartment. Nothing of other significant-- Don't call a half million dollars significant? What in the hell do you think you're doing? This isn't the time for closet games. You've got a half million dollars in blood-money 'and part of it's mine'' Get out of here. Or what? You're gonna lock me up or something? I want what's mine. You listen to me, mister, and you listen straight. 'Fly away.' We've talked all we have to. No, we haven't. You buy me or kill me, Brill. Um-Um. Not a penny. Hey, Walt, help me out, will you? I got a Spanish speaking family over here. - Get somebody else, will you? - Thanks. There are three others. But if you make a deal with me 'you might live to spend some of that money.' [phone ringing] I pay you, then I've deal with them. That's what you want? Don't have to give them a dime. They don't know you have it. 'But if I walk out of here empty pockets' I'm gonna have to give them a call. How do I know you won't call them anyway? Because they think I have the money. If I was gonna set you up, I'd do it someplace else. 'Not here in your own backyard.' [ringing continues] Detective Brill. Hello? 'Hello?' One-sixth gives you a chance. Why so little? Because I take only what's mine. And you don't have too much time to make up your mind. [dramatic music] What the hell's this? You think they'll be trying to lose us? McClain knows better. They'll be running for the rest of their lives. They will be anyway. Don't turn around. Three men. Yeah, I know. Names? Only if they hit us. I assume they hope that I'll panic and make my move. You mean, like you're making? 'Yeah, they're smarter.' We shouldn't go to the money. Maybe that's what they want. AThat's what I want. It's gonna be a fight either way. 'If we take them at the money, it saves us a trip.' Now, look. Whatever happens don't hurt Brill until we find out where the money is. Get McClain. We can always wait out the cop. - You understand? - Yeah, yeah. - You? - Yeah. Where are you going? If it's gonna be a showdown. We better find some place quiet. You're not forgetting the money, are you? No. [Clinger whistles] I want McClain. You take what you can get, pally. This ain't no game. Names. 'The little one is Gough. He's unpredictable.' The white crow, that's Kifka. And right now, he's angry. [metal clanging] At least they are not trigger happy. They really can't afford to. They might hurt you. Alright, let's get something started. You go first. You'll be harder to see. You know, you're quite an opportunist, Brill. [gunshot] (Clinger) McClain. McClain. 'McClain, we're getting nowhere.' 'Let's talk.' [clangs] McClain. About what? Let's negotiate. - 'He wanna make a deal.' - 'Can we trust him?' - 'No.' - 'What after they're all gone'' - 'You still take only 1/6?' - 'That's what I said.' (Walter) Then let's take him next. How about it, McClain? Talk to the man for awhile, will you? 'Clinger.' Yeah? You come up here with me. Just you and me. 'I'll take you to the money.' 'We'll split it.' I'll take care of McClain. You pay off your boys. You gotta give me some kind of insurance. Like what? How about McClain? 'What about that, McClain?' [gunshot continues] 'Kifka! Kifka.' Kifka! Clinger, come on out. It's all over. Let's go. - It's where we part company. - The money, Brill. You're sitting on it. It's in the seat. You know, you might have made, first Detective, after all. I intend to. You mean you're turning your bundle in, huh? All but your split and $50,000. It might work if you can convince the man upstairs that I got away with both our shares. That's right. If.. [announcer] 'Please do not leave your car unattended.' 'Parking in this area limited to three minutes.' 'Please do not leave your car unattended.' May I help you, sir? That's for Flight eight. [announcement continues] - Thank you. - Thanks. Thank you. Have a pleasant flight. Thank you. [dramatic music] [female #3] 'McClain.' [music stops]
