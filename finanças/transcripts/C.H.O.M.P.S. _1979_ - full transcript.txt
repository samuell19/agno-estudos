C.H.O.M.P.S. CANINE HOME PROTECTION SYSTEM At present, your home is not safe, even when you are there. So, protect yourselfs! Be sure you have good locks... ...good security systems. In addition, you might consider getting a watchdog. And I'm not necessarily talking about a large dog. Any dog that can bark, will make a good watchdog. It can alert you and your neighbors. As your police chief says, "Your police force is doing it's up most to combat this increase in home burglaries in our town." "This situation is intolerable. And it must be stopped." And he's right. If things continues, we could soon find ourselves at the mercy of criminal element. Not only in your homes, but in your businesses, your factories and even in your schools. Not one of you is safe with this hoodlums who are invading our homes. Get outta here and fast! Chomps, 86! All right! That was one surprised burglar. In a speech for citizens of this fear city last night, chief Patterson stressed the need for all of us to work together to hold the alarming rise homes burglaries. Where is he? He was supposed to be here five minutes ago. RJ, he said something unexpected delayed. Something unexpected? I don't expect anything unexpected to happen when I call an emergency meeting, Sharp. - Of course I told him that. - This is an emergency! We were being flooded with complains, and our security systems is a push over for burglaries. If something isn't done soon, Norton Security Systems would be left with nothing but a big old fashioned padlock. In our own front door! "Any dog that can bark and alert you and your neighbours, will make a good watchdog." A watchdog! That's all we need. This business is already going to the dogs! Keep an eye on things for me, Rascal! Good boy! Hand over that bone, turkey. Monster, come on get out of there! Monster come on, Monster! Monster, yes you bad boy! Now come on, why don't you go home and go pick on somebody your own size? Go. Don't look at him. Smart ass. Up your poop, granny! Hey, Rascal! You just can't keep yourself out of trouble, can you? Where is Brian? You just missed him, daisy. He drove off about five minutes ago. Bye-bye, Rascal. Now hurry up, Muffin! I was hoping to catch him before he left from my father's office. Your father is upset with Brian. No, he is not upset. He's furious! - I'll see you later, mrs Flower, thank you! - Not at all, dear... Isn't she a lovely girl, Muffin? Muffin! Muffin! Where are you, Muffin? Muffin! Naughty girl. How many times i've told you not to disappear like that? - Mr. Norton, I'm sorry I'm late but I... - I'm sorry to, Foster. Sorry I ever hired you as my security systems engineer. - RJ, you're just upset... - You bet I'm upset! We're loosing costumers left and right. When you hired Brian right outta college it was because it was at the top of his class You hired because it's brilliant. He's a genius. - Thank's, Ken! - If he's so brilliant, how come he's security system is such a miserable flap. Mr. Norton, system is fail safe there's absolutely no way anyone can penetrate it. Unless someone is given away the secret of his operation. He's right. Tht's why you put it in your own office. Why with this one swich activated, no one could get into this office without setting off every alarm in the building. - Just stay right where you are! - Let go of my daughter! - Casey, you all right? - Yes, I'm not scared of this guys. This is an office building. There's nothing you'd want here. - Yeah? - Your wallets! Give me the wallets! Quick, the bag! You guys, come on, you're not gonna do this! What can you say to a man with a gun? How about takeing all those waches and those rings... Everybody empty their pockets. Go ahead, have a fill up the bag, go ahead! - Sure, Brooks! - What do you mean, Brooks? Why did you say my name for? Yeah... I'm sorry, Brooks! Okay, everything goes in the sack. Go ahead. And by the way, your rings and your stuff to. Go ahead! Okay, sister, hand it over! You heard me. Hand it over! Here! Do you want it in your hand or over your head? Casey, don't push them. Okay, folks, see? Everything worked out all right. Nobody got hurt. All right, let's not blow it this time have think somebody make the foolish move like calling the cops. We're gonna be right outside this door... Got the door? - Got the door. - Okay, now nobody make a move. Call the police, I'll lock the door. Not anybody move. Okay you, let the phone. Casey, do like the man says. Okay, nobody move. You open the door. Okay, now stay right where you are! Nobody been hurt so... Open the door. Nobody's been hurt so far. Okay, stay right where you are! Nobody move! Okay! All right! Brooks! Brooks! Come on! That's it! That does it! No wonder we have so many complains about your brilliant security system. If those two clowns can penetrate it anybody can. You're fired, Foster! And that means you and your electronic junk. - But Mr. Norton... - Dad! No "but" Foster and no interfernece there, Casey! I should never listen to you in the first place and hire this... this... looser. That said, I better go. Exactly what I had in mind. And you better go before I call the police. Because I might ask them to put you away for our protection. Brian... Brian, wait! Dad, you're making a very big mistake. I'll had you know that Brian is just about ready with a new security system that will... it will be the biggest thing to hit this industry ever. It'll knock you off your feet. No, it won't, because I don't want to know what it is. Operator, get me the police. This is an emergency. I'm gonna go talk to her. Look, Casey... Casey don't worry, I think I can help you. I don't think so. You know how stubborn my father can be. Look, if Brian is got a new system, maybe I can figure out some way of getting your father take a look at it. You know... give Brian another chance. How about we have dinner tonight and we could talk about it. - Huh? - I don't think so, Ken. Look I'd love to, but I really have to go over and see Brain. I'd love to help you, but I can't if I don't know what Brian is working on. I don't even know what it is myself. Look, all I know is it keeps teeling me it's something revolutionary. - Okay, drive carefully! - Okay! - And I'll see you later. - See you later. - Thanks a lot for trying to help. - That's okay. It's her again. This ought be interestin' - What's up? - My temper... That's what's up. I'm furious! - I'll never talk to my father again! - Casey! - Never in a hundred years! - Slow down... What kind of man retires own future san-in-low? Casey! You mean you wouldn't had told him we want to get married? - Yeah, why shouldn't I? - Casey, I tought we had agree - not to tell your father until... - All right, Brian. All right. I didn't tell him. But I'm going to, tonight. And if he tries to talk me out of this by, wich it will, I know him well because he doesn't think I'm old enough to make my own decisions... Brian, please, I'm trying to... Brian... All right... Look... I don't think this is a very good time to tell your father about our big plans... First of all, I know he thinks about Ken Sharp. Then let him marry Ken Sharp. And now this business is going to pop because my security system is malfunction. I just don't think he's being very fair to you, that's all. Isn't being unfair. System isn't working. Casey, I can't for the life of me figure out why, but... ...just isn't. In fact, for work for this new security system I'm developing and the fact that he just fired me... I'd quit. Brian, when is this brilliant new system gonna be ready, anyway, huh? - Just didn't seen yet! - Brian? It's ready and you didn't tell me? Telling you now. It's ready enough to show you. Okay, so show me! I better check on what's going on. - 49! - Forty what? Well? What do you think? What I think of what? About my revolutionary new security system. Of Rascal? I don't get it. You will. Watch. 17. 44. 66. Well? Well... Well, that's the best trained dog I ever seen. Brian, where is the new invention? - That's it! - That's it? Rascal is it? That's Rascal. - Who's that, then? - My revolutionary new security system. ...revolutionary new security system, okay. Gonna get a closer look. Am I seeing double? I don't belive it. I just don't. 48! 86! Watch this! Brian! What are you doing? There you are! Three years of hard work. You build a watchdog. An electronic watchdog. Computerized, self activating mobile... Unlike any watchdog it ever existed. That's fantastic. I mean this is incredible. - I can't belive it! - Neither were the burglaries. Take a look at this. I call it my "Canine Home Protection System". - Chomps, for short. - Chomps, huh? And Chomps is a completely program security system. But what could this little dog do to a burglar. Roll over on it? It can do a lot more than that, Casey. A lot more. But, RJ, we need something extraordinary to turn things around for Norton Security Systems. If Brian really has come up with a revolutionary new system, - we can't afford to pass it up. - I tell you, Sharp, I am not interested. Who is it? It's Gibbs. Listen Gibbs, I don't wanna go through this again. I got a very tough morning. Listen, it must be tough having your office broken in to... Especially if yore manufacturing burgler alarm! "I got to report on the police call". I know what you're calling about and the answer is and it always will be, no! - I am not selling! - Be sensible, Ralph. You're in big trouble. I know what's been happened to you with the new system. Well, you are in for a big surprise, Gibbs. You and everybody else in this business it going to be obsolete. Because what nobody knows is that my brilliant chief engineer has just come up with a new system that is going to revolutionize the entire industry. Norton, sounds like you stopped makeing security systems and start makeing fucking bull stories. Stories? Well, I'm gonna put on my vice president in charge of production. He'll tell you. What, you change your mind? You gonna bring Brian back? Not in your life! But I had something to say to that bold. Here, get on the phone, tell him I am not bluffing. Mr. Gibbs, Norton is not bluffing. Now let him worry for a while. So, then I tried out this doberman model. Rascal, is not going hurt you. What was wrong with that model? - Chasing cars. - And that's too bad? It's worse. Kept catching them. Okay, Pussycat, we're at the address and everything looks... ...green and clean. So that's why I decide on Rascal as a model. Because of the... surprise factor. I get it. Who ever think of a little dog like that it will be a ferocious watchdog, - right? - Right. Right, Rascal? Brian, how can you tell them apart? Well, I'm proud to say... It's difficult. We'll 10ish-22 you later. Good bye! Hey, what's all that mean? "Green and clean" means we're clear. 10ish-22 means will report to him in person. The plot sickens, hey, with those jockers... That I got. Come on! And this... This is Chomps central control system. This is an exact duplicate of canines nervous system, but... ... it's activated by this highly sofisticated minicomputer. Plus, Casey, is got the ability to reproduce any sound I care to program. Now this circuits duplicate all the five senses. Is cheating informations the form of... sounds, movements, and others break them down to electronic impulses, that... control Chomps super-hearing, ...super-vision, including X-RAY vision... And even super-strength and super-speed. The outer shell is made of a virtually indestructible material I developed myself. Brian, you're a genius! Look, look! Looks like Rascal wants to play. It's one of the few things I couldn't teach Chomps. But now on the other hand, doesn't shit, doesn't require feedings, or walks... It's a perfect watchdog. That should freak out any burglar in town. Eyes right, Muffin! Muffin! First off all, is so easy to operate. All it takes to activate it from house dog to watchdog. Is a command 21. What's he looking at, Brian? Must be something outside. Get! Chomps! 86! I'm sorry, I'm sure. Couldn't be them. Maybe something went wrong. It must've been a malfunction. Think I better leave him in program for house dog till I can check out his circuitry. Sorry, ladies. It was a dog that made us do it. A dog? Come on... We got to report this. 12, Chomps! Brian! Brian, somebody was here. It must've been the burglar. A real burglar. Brian, Chomps works. - Hope you're right, Casey. - You got to show this to my father. Casey, I can't. I haven't got all the bugs worked out, yet. Bugs, please, whatever... Brian, Chomps is terrific. Chomps, you're the greatest crime biter in the world! Looks like Rascal's jealous. He know that's another thing I didn't program into Chomps. An affection response. I think Rascal has enough affection for the both of them put together. There's the phone. I wouldn't believe it if I get to see it. Give me a dime. - Give me a dime! - I can control, - but can't get my fingers up. - Would you give me this? There's the dime! - Now give it to me! - No! - I sayd give it to me! - No, no you promise that I can make the report this time. What you gonna tell him? Dog chopped down a tree. - Not gonna belive you. - That's to report, isn't it? Make the report. But make it stop it. I'm freezing cold. You got the number? - Here's the number. - There's the number? Muffin! Where just she go? Who cares, old bag. That whistle's blowin' my mind. Chomps, what is it? What's the matter? - We got to catch him! Chomps, 86! 86! - Chomps! Chomps! Somebody says that the sound of the tone I got twenty seconds to leave a message. Go ahead, hurry up! You got twenty seconds. Go ahead, talk! Foxy one reporting, sir... ...we went to the address... ...as for instructions... - Gesundheit! - Thank you! Talk! Hurry up, you gonna loose the message! - You got another dime? - No, I don't have another dime! That was the last dime. - Talk, for crying out loud! - Where was I? Where was... Hey, where's he go off to? It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a super-dog! It's her fault! I don't know. That's him. He jumped right over my car. There he goes. I'll get him. - Oh, wonderful. What's he up to? Geez! There he is! Chomps, here, Chomps! 48! So of this bugs I was talking about, Casey. For once in a wile, Chomps is take's off that way. - Can't figure out why. - But you can fix it, right? Brian, you've gotta show my father. Chomps, 21! Believe me, dad. You never seen anything like this in your entire life. I don't care, Casey! I never want have anything to do with Brian or any other junk computers geniuses ever again. - Forget him, it is nutty idea. - It is not a nutty idea. Whatever it is, is nutty. Sharp is a guy for you. Is the best man I've have. Look, I might as well tell you. I already invited Brian over here. - Here? - Yes. Good bye. I'll sneak out before he gets here. Dad, stop it! Dad... Come on Please get back here and listen to me. - I'll use the back exit. - No, you won't! You're acting like a child. Show me a child with a five milion dollar business on the brink of bankruptcy. Stay right here! - Good morning, Mr. Norton! - It was... Dad... Brian, come on in, we've been waithing for you... Haven't we? I want you to know I'm here under protest, Foster. And I appreciate it, Mr. Norton. Look, if you just give me half a chance to show you what I've got... Show me! Show me! I'll tell you it's a nutty ideea, then I can go to work and you can go collect that employment. Where is it? Well, sir... - It's in here. - What is it? Bells? Electric eyes? An unpickable lock? What? Not quite. Chomps, 21! Is this a joke, Foster? - That's your dog! - No, sir, that's not Rascal. That's your revolutionary development? If I've seen that dog once I've seen it one hundred times. I'm gonna be very calm about this... And I know what you're up to. But I'll give you exactly three seconds to get this stupid mutt off my chest! There's a Mercedes here. And each operation of this "Canine Home Protection System" Chomps, for short, each operation is triggered by a new miracle comand. You mean when I said "If I've seen him once, I've seen him..." Right. That number, ...triggers his karate jump. Well, dad, what you think? It's amazing, but, really, what can a little dog like that do? Even it's an electronic dog? Well, for one thing, when is activated for watchdog... ...like is right now, he can detect a prowler, a burglar anywhere within his own propriety. His first reaction is to zero in the suspect area. When his visual sensors confirm a suspect senses - ...then... - Brian, that's what he's doing now. - Brian, what's going on? - Prowler... I hope! You better be right, Foster. Ha-ha! Hey, look! Chomps is chaseing a pickup. Now that's what I call an original invention! A dog that chases cars! Let's follow him anyway. - Hey, Jim! - Hey, Scott, what's happening? Man, I didn't have a decent new story in a weeks. - Even a garaj sale it would be an event. - My favorite place to shop. Ticket time. Let's go. Nevermind, we're being covered. A dog with a police siren build in? Now that's gotta be news! Let's go, Chuck! Step on it, will ya? The mutt's gainin' on us. Hey, he's gone. We lost him. - That mutt is right over there! - He took a shortcut! Look at him! What's he doing? - Unbelievable! - Hang on! Hey! - Get down! - Duck! Chomps! 48! Brian, it's fantastic! - Dad, did I tell you? Did I tell you? - When you're right, you're right... - What's going on here right now? - Hey, hey it's that truck in there. Excuse me! Excuse me! Scott Elliott, KYOL News. That dog started it all. First, he pulled a van across the road, then a pickup came in here without a permit. ...then the battle started. Did he say that dog just started this? That's right. But this is not just any dog... ...this is part of a new top secret security development... ...that we are working on at Norton Security Systems. Excuse me! Excuse me! Can you explain the siren? Easily, as you may know, Norton Security Systems has long been a lider in providing security and alarm systems to the citizens of this city. - Perhaps Mr. Norton... - Norton Security Systems... ...the owner of this remarkable dog can explain just what happened. Yes, indeed. Now, this is no ordinary dog... As a matter of fact, it represents an amazing new invention that we call "Canine Home Protection System". "Chomps", a highly sophisticated revolutionary security system. Well, I'd say that dog is definitely one in a hundred. Chomps, 86! You triggered his karate jump! Great dog! Great dog... That should be mine. Sharp, I want you to meet Norton Security Systems new vice-president. - In charge of system development. - And, may I add, future son-in-law. What happened between yesterday and this morning? A revolution, Sharp. A revolution! In one fell swoop, this young man has revolutionized - the entire security systems industry. - The invention is that incredible? - Well... - Incredible? - It is beyond incredible. It's... It's... - ...revolutionary? Exactly. And after the demonstration that I've arranged for tonight at the Gold Key unity store... it's in the bag. - But what is it? - You'll see soon. Brian here is arranged a demonstration forged in the parking lot. Al right... I can't wait to see his face when we show him... It's gonna be terrific! Ok, I've set up the ladder. All right! Well, let's get started! Chomps, 21! That is your new super security system? - You gotta be jokeing. - It's no joke, Sharp. Belive me, that Canine Home Protection System is the biggest thing since the lock. I think a demonstration answer all your question, Ken. Now, the first test that I've set up is to demonstrate how efective Chomps can be in forfeiting a break in by a second storey man. That little doggie is gonna stop a burglar? That's right. Let me be the second storey man. - Ken, I don't think you should... - No, really... Please, I insist! - He insist, Brian... - But... Okay, I'm the burglar. So what? Here it goes. Chomps, 66! Hei, what you're doing? Hei, hold! Hold, boy, down boy! Easy, boy, easy! What he up to? Hey, hold, hei stop! Down boy! Down boy! Move it boy! Come on guys, enough of that! Look out now! Chomps, 21! Nice going, Chomps! Now, what do you think, Sharp? The ladder slipped, it was an accident. I'm sorry to have to be the one to prove it to you. Look, I'm a car thief, stop me! You asked for it. Chomps, 56! - Are you all right? - Nevermind that! What do you think of Chomps? I think I'd like to go home now and recover. Yes? Carl, wait to hear this, I found what the revolutionary new project is. It's a dog! I know you won't believe it but I didn't believe it myself until I saw. But it can do anything, it's electronic but it looks absolutely real and it's top secret. Secret? Secret it is a shut you down me. It's a secret I just saw on television. - Television! - Now, look! I want that dog! I want that dog more then I wanted anything. And I intend to get that dog, do you read me? Yes, sir. Your partnership hangs in a balance, Sharp. What would Norton think if he found out that you're helping his competition? ...sabotaging his systems? Huh, Sharp? I need to think about it. All right, I 'll get right on it. You get on it... and get it! Okay! The number! Okey, listen close. The system is gonna be tested right at Gold Key unity. Your assignment is to get it. - You got it? - Yeah... Listen, the only reason we showed up is to tell you that we're not showing up anymore. That watchdog is still guarding the system, we don't want any part of it. You dummies, that dog is the system and we want it! Look, you want more money, we'll double the fee. They said they'd offer us double. Ask'em for triple. Hello? Hello? My partner and I have decided we want triple. You, disconnected the phone. Give me a dime... Give me a dime. I'm sorry, Brooks. Well, go get a dime and don't attract any attention! Okay, okay, relax. Flight 158 from New York now arriving at gate 53. What do you think you're doing? - I'm trying to borrow a dime. - I mean with the mask... Brooks told me not to attract attention. Do you have a dime? - Get down. The coast is clear. I don't wanna hear a word. Bring the bag. We got to get that dog. Come on! All clear, Mr. Merkle. I want you to know, I think you have lost your mind, Norton. How can you tell me, this little dog would protect my store when your security system and five police dogs couldn't? Like I said, Jonathan, I can't tell you. It's top secret. Just remember that I personally will make up any losses you might occur. It's your money... Brian, let Chomps loose. Okey, Chomps, it's your big chance. 21! - All right, lock it up, now! - Yes, sir. Foster will be monitoring his new system from his car, yeah, so will be on top of it every minute, you see? All I can see is a new system for going bankrupt. Well, good luck! You too! Good night, sir. This is Norton Security. We have a Gold Key alarm connected at eighteen fourteen hours. New electronic security test in effect at the same time. Come on. Just think. In one short day, you get your job back... ...and we get my father's blessing... Do you believe this? It's been quite a day. And we have the whole evening to ourselves. - Brian, what is this? - It's Chomps monitoring device. I keep tabs on Chomps wherever I go. As long as there's no flashing or beeping, there's no problem. - Hey, on coming. - Yeah... Sh! Don't blow it. - Got it! - You're the best, Brooks. What are this things? - Station 24, Norton sound alarm at the Gold Key department store. Okay, come on. Let's move. - Great furs! - Come on, let's go! Fantastic, Chomps, fantastic! - Were thieves! - That's right, officer. And Chomps got'em. I wonder what that Forester guy feeds that dog. You mind the dog? What about us? Well, think of it this way, Brooks: What more can happen to us? Norton? This is Gibbs. Now, here's my last and best offer: I'm offering you a merger. So, you heard about what happened at the Gold Key unity store. Well, you need to know there's no chance of a merge or anything else. Give up, Gibbs! And pardon me while I hung up. How do you like that? The minute somebody comes up with anything great all the world want's to get a piece of it. Gibbs has a lot to offer. Maybe a merge wouldn't be such a bad idea. Are you kidding? Besides, I'm already got another offer to merge. Another offer? Really? Who made it? Park systems! - Park Sistems? - And they came to me. - What you think about that? - I think it's absolutely fantastic. You bet it's fantastic! Park Systems no less! One of the biggest electronic systems conglomerates in the world chart. In the world! Once they see Chomps in action I will be able to name my own terms. Yeah, we're have to work for really spectacular demonstration. It's already planed and arranged for. When is it gonna be? The location is top secret. I had to give my word. Good thinking. This is one time we don't want any leaks. Really? Bye. - Hi, Case... Hello, hei... what a surprise! - Hi! - How are you, huh? - Ken... I'm fine, I'm fine. - Sit down! - Thank you. Thank you. Are you expecting Brian? - Yeah, who else? - No doubt about it, he's a genius. Your father was telling me about the demonstration - planned for Park Systems today. - Yeah, isn't it exciting? Oh, and vague to, vague... Who would ever suspect we'd hold the demonstration there? Using Park Systems proving grounds it's got to be impressive. But, Casey, please be careful, don't go telling anyone about that. The word is tight security, that's where I come in. Hi, Casey! Sorry I'm late. Hi, Brian. Don't worry about it, Ken, was keep me company. Thank's Ken, but, please, don't let this keep you. Sure, Brian. As a matter of fact, I was just about to go. Wait a second, Ken. Why don't you stay and have lunch with us. Let him go, Casey. I'm sure that Ken has a very important lunch in date that he doesn't wanna miss. Oh, right. Thank you for reminding me, old pall. I'll see you around, Case. - What was that all about? - Just decide I didn't like him. - He's a creep. - For your information that creep - had a lot of nice things to say about you. - I still think he's a creep. And I say you're no gentleman. I don't believe the most important day of my life and we have an argument. All I said was he's a creep. Well, he's a creep. You know, besides this mysterious malfunctions, you don't give me any trouble whatsoever. Maybe I should weep up a electronic Casey, solve all my problems. All right, listen, for save keeping I think I'd better leave you programmed for watchdog. Chomps, 21! For all I know, she's having lunch with him right now. Double trouble... Dog catcher... What a setup. Gotcha! Bye, bye, baby! - What do you say, Al? How many mutts you got today? Got a blackjack, old buddy, 21. - Casey? - What a day, Foster, what a day! After we do this demonstration for Park Systems, the sky is the limit. I gave the office the whole day off to celebrate. That's terrific, Mr. Norton. What's the matter, Foster? It's Chomps! - No. - He malfunction again! - No. - You lost him! - No. - He short-circuited. - No. It's Casey. - Casey short-circuited? I don't said she did, we had a misunderstanding. She didn't mentioned to me. It was a stupid argument. Look, I got to go talk to her. But... but... The demonstration! I've gotta see Casey first! Foster, the demonstration is more important! Not to me it isn't! I'll be right back. Well, I'm not waithing. If he think I'm gonna sit arround here and twiddling my thumbs while a mug of milion dolars contract was done to drain, is sadly mistaken. Gotta handle a fortune like this very carefully. Park Systems proving ground... Good! I'm gonna make it my business to be there to. - This could work for us, Carl. - How? Norton is close shop for today. The plans for Chomps are in the seif. I get it. Who needs the dog if I get the plans? That's a good idea... With Norton at the proving ground this should be a s snap. Even for those two clowns you got working for you. I'll take care of it. You can depend on it. All this was just a misunderstanding, Casey. Yeah, it was... I'm sorry. Look, I didn't mean half the things I said. - How about the other half? - The other half? This is the other half. - What? - Your father's already gone. I tought you said he was gonna wait for you to go to the demonstration. Yeah. Think he took Chomps? I don't know. Why don't you find out? Chomps is gone. What now? 12! What's that mean? Here's Chomps! - Brian, if that's Chomps, then my father... - Took Rascal! - Yeah. - Casey, it can blow the whole demonstration. - Oh, Brian... - Chomps, 21! Twenty-one? He must be old enough to vote. All right, Mr. Norton this is the test. Set up by Park Systems for you're Canine Home Protection System. Out there, on that concrete apron we have placed six explosive devices. ...one in the part of each of the carriers wich I remotely control. But, only one of the explosives is live, however. Now, the devices explodes, when this antenna is pushed over by the front axle of one of the carriers. And your dog's job will be to locate that live mine and move it safely out of the part where it is. Now, do you think your system can do that? Norton Canine Home Protection System can do that or anything else - you and your engineers can bring up. - Okey, let's proceed. - Rascal better be ok. - Let's hope they haven't started yet. Okey, Chomps, 21! Come on, boy, this is your big chance. 22! Maybe I get it wrong. 4? 14? 8, Chomps, 8! Terrific, terrific! Watch him. He's a killer! That's all a part of his deceptive appearance. - Closed for "Chomps day". - Closed for "Chomps day". Is that like "Mother's day"? - No, it's not like... - All right, shut up and listen! The plans are in Norton safe on the third floor, I'll disconect the alarm system so you can get inside the office where I'll have to reset it so the disconect won't register then. - You got that? - Got it. Okey. When you get the plans you knock twice and I'll disconect again. - You can count on us. - Okey, just make it fast. You go right up there. - Can't you drive any faster? - Casey, I'm going as fast as I can. All right, all systems go. Okey, Chomps, go and get that mine! Go on, Chomps. Go on! Sharp said the safe is behind the wood panel. What panel? If he work's on numbers something is not computing. Oh, he has plenty of time yet to find the live mine. He probably got a fix on to this as soon he hit the field. Is that a wood panel? That's a wood panel. He also said the button was behind the desk. - This is it? - Yes, is it! Gimme the stuff now. They gotta be in the office by now. - If your father it'd only waited for me... - Come on! This wouldn't be some kind of a practical joke! Is it? You must remember that what you're looking at is a revolutionary new concept in security systems. Chomps has indeed ignored the first with dummies explosives without a moment's hesitation. I promise you, he will zeroing on that explosive in any second now. Magic fingers! Magic touch. - Dad - Mr. Norton! - Dad! Dad! - Mr. Norton! Mr. Norton! Casey, Foster! Glad you made it. Chomps is just zeroing on the explosive. - Explosives? - Right! I had him programmed for watchdog. Neutralizing explosives should be a cinch. - Rascal, stop! - Rascal? Chomps, 21! How's it coming, Brooks? How's it coming, Brooks? What I said? It's not what you said, it's where you said it! Go! Go, boy, go! Fantastic, Chomps, fantastic! You're a hero, you saved Rascal's life. That was great job. Great! You did it! You did it! - That dog is a menace. - Gibbs, what you doing here? I keep asking myself the same question right now. You were spying. Admit it, you were spying. I wasn't spying. And even if I was, it won't make any difference, you're a competitive. I still say you're spying. You don't know it yet, but you're almost out of business. - What is he mean by that, Mr. Norton? - Out of business? Didn't you see that fabulous demonstration? I think you better explain yourself. Norton, I don't have to explain anything to you. Pussycat to Fat cat! I contacted my men and everything is going according to plan at Norton's. Operation "Plan" is a cinch. Over! Operation "Plan"? This thing's too tough. We're gonna have to blow it. Where is that? Give me this! You keep your hands up of my stuff! This is very delicate. It blows from here to Kindom Come. - Set the timer! - Pussycat to Fat cat, hello? Over! - Pussycat? - Dad, they're breaking in to get the plans for Chomps. Call the police! Come on, Brian, we better go stop them! Fat cat, huh? We have exactly three minutes before that thing blows up. Three minutes! Come on, open the door! - We have a 459 alarm at Norton Secur... Look, I know it's my own building, just get here. You triggered the alarm. You supposed to go by knocking. Do it! That window! Climb onto that wall! Come on! Hurry, Brian! - What's going on? - It's Sharp. What are you doing here? Brian, I'm glad you're here. I just stopped by the office and the alarm went off. - Somebody must be breaking... - Sharp, we got to get out of here! Excuse me! Wait a minute. You're pussycat! Go! Chomps, 21! Go! Go! - Go, boy! - Come on! - Come on, let's see if the plans are safe. - Okay. Turn around! Lay over! Spread 'em! Do you know today is "Chomps day"? Casey, get back! Oh, Brian, poor Chomps. I'm afraid it's too late for that, Rascal. Brian... Brian, look at his eyes. His eyes. His tail! There's still a spark in him. Casey... I didn't put that sound in his computer tapes. I think... I think maybe I can... I can! That old Chomps is looking better than new. Well, with Gibbs and Sharp out of the way we will be back in no.1 in no time. When do you think we can get in the production on the new system, Brian? Within a month, I hope, sir. 49! That is incredible! And I think I solved the problem with that malfunction too, sir. At least hasn't shown up for a while. Has anybody seen my Muffin? No, sorry, Mrs. Flower, I haven't. Oh, well, this dog whistle always brings her back. What's happening? A whistle. That's the cause the malfunction, a whistle! Hey! Well, I think I'd better go home now. What's he up to now? Oh, shit... Subtitled by Gya Lee
