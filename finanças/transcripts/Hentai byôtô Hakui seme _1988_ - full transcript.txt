Pervert Ward: Torturing the White Uniform How do you feel, Mr. Yajima'? Yajima'? It looks like you still haven't recovered. You've lost your memory. Yajima Akira. That's just a provisional name though. Your hypothalamus has been damaged. - Hypo... - Yes. Right about here there is a spot where your nerves converge. If you damage this spot, your body's sensory perception becomes dull. That means, for example, if you're a man, your body may undergo feminisation. This is why I'm administering male hormones to you. So... Is that what the nurse just put into me'? If I stop the treatment, what would happen? Well, first, you would start to lose interest in women. Stop joking around. By the way... It looks like your beard is growing slower, no'? Disrupted by the hormones, no doubt. That's enough! Who am I'?! If you don't know yourself, how should I know'? You must know something! Tell me! I wasn't at the scene. Apparently, you were found lying in the street somewhere near this hospital. You were discovered by one of the off-duty nurses passing by. Perhaps it was a hit-and-run. That nurse contacted us. The nurse who was just here... ...and a security guard carried you in here. Then, I was put in charge of your case. More and more... ...youths living in cities... ...are committing... ...suicide. But... ...the problem is... ...that it's raining today... ...and I don't have an umbrella. I have to go. I have to go see you. I have to go to your town. I'll get wet... ...in the rain. Good morning! - Uchida! - Yes'? Will Ikezawa be here tomorrow'? Yes. - Is there something... - No. I just figured you would know. She's always doting over you like a younger sister, so I asked. She doesn't dote over me! I don't know why she isn't here myself... This is Where "the metal bat incident" took place. Now, We will re-enact the incident alongside the victim. Last night, at about 12:30 am... ...the victim, Sasaki Hiroshi, 21 years old... ...was struck on the back of the head from behind with something like a metal bat. Sasaki lost consciousness and was unable to sea the face of hrs assailant. This incident is similar to the previous metal bat attacks We have seen... No, no! Don't touch me directly. Put on rubber gloves. Put on a condom. Human bodies are covered in bacteria. Nu! When I do this... ...I'm driven by an impulse... ...to cut this body open with my scalpel... ...and see what's inside. I feel like maybe I'm crazy. But that kind of impulse is good, isn't it'? More and more... ...youths living in cities... are committing suicide. But... ...the problem is... - ... that it's raining today... - Could you lend me an umbrella? - ... and I don't have an umbrella. - Huh? I don't have an umbrella. What will you do'? I'm not sure... Out of the way! What happened'?! - I have to report this. - Don't bother. But you were attacked! Don't do it. If you report it, you'll become involved. Were you able to remember something? No, it's just a hunch. What happens if I die'? Why would you ask something like that'? If someone with no memory dies... Do they go to heaven? Or do they end up in hell'? First you go to the morgue. The morgue'? A storage place for dead bodies. Morgue - What are you doing here'?! - I just wanted to check it out. Are you on a night walk'? This is a restricted area! I wondered if I could go for a swim. - Good morning! - Morning. Mr. Yajima is so mysterious. He's just your type! Don't be silly! It just seems like you're interested. Losing your memory is scary. I just want him to get better soon. It's a peculiar trait of this industry that many fall for their patients. Don't call this an 'industry! You're so serious today! That's weird... But please do tell him not to go walking around the hospital. - What happened'? - He was in the morgue. He's your responsibility, so please take care of it. - Since when do you like baseball? - It's to address my lack of exercise. I see. You are always so busy. But isn't golf more common'? What, I can't swing a bat'? That's not what I meant. I guess this is just right for you. Good afternoon! What, selling some new medicine'? Or something else'? I'd love to sit and chat with Uchida, but today I'm here on sales duty. Could I see that bat for a second'? Hey! Sorry! It's an old habit! You used to play baseball? During high school we made it to the prefectural finals. It even looked like we were going to win. But then it started to rain, and our team's luck was washed away. We lost and the national tournament disappeared before our eyes. This store is dosed Stop! Don't touch me! Why are you following me'? I was wondering where you'd go. I'm looking for my memory. I didn't have anything on me but this'? I don't know. Will you help me'? Search for my memory'? This morning's forecast for Tokyo, as always... ...is for continuing rain with heavy, stagnant air. When asked about why the rain has continued non-stop for the past month... the Meteorological Agency simply stated it was an unusual Weather phenomenon. This "unusual phenomenon" is being looked at with great interest... ...not only from a meteorological point of view, but from all angles. A certain civil group is even purporting it is being caused by abnormal acidity... ...brought on by a nuclear incident in a neighboring Asian country. If the rain continues like this... ...it is feared that it may start to cause a psychological} panic in certain people. Some have theorized that the recent 'metal bat incidents' are somehow related. On that note, we would like to now speak with Dr. Akasaka... ...who has developed a theory regarding the 'metal bat incidents'. While We are all troubled by this rain... ...it is possible that the criminal has been somehow agitated by it... I have to pray. - Good morning! - Morning. - What's that'? - I took up golf. - Let me see. - No! It's embarrassing for someone to see your equipment... ...when you're still such a novice. Well then, don't bring it here. I want to practice my swing when I start to feel tired at night. Please be careful. Nu! Stop! ...epilepsy is possible... Excuse me. The hypothalamus treatment seems to be progressing. I've been administering the medicine as you have instructed. But it seems like he has still not reached the critical point. I wonder why... He seems to recognize me as a woman. It may appear that way because you recognize him as a man. In other words, it's a reflection of your own consciousness. Why do you have to analyze each and every thing like that'? Because I'm a neurologist. That's my job. That much is obvious. But when it comes to me, stop your analyzing. You're in love with him, aren't you'? With Yajima, I mean. It's a present, so you can get better quicker. Is that medicine'? It's sand. Sometimes silky and smooth, sometimes sticky. It's so strange. This is bottled strangeness. Sometimes, I have them give me injections as well. At those times, I feel like I lose my memory for hours. Quit teasing me. It's true! It's kind of like you. Like me'? Hey, you know how to smile! I'm sorry to call you like this. There was something I wanted to show you. This is the sand you were talking about'? I brought it all in from the ocean. The ocean, huh'? I feel so uneasy when I'm alone. Like, Yaa! It makes me want to scream. Does this have something to do with me'? When I carried you to the hospital... ...it fell out of your coat pocket. Of course, I was going to give it back to you. I was just scared. So, this... .is my memory. Does it help you remember anything'? Come on! You bitch! Excuse me. This is you, right, Doctor? A man who assaulted me had it on him. - What is this'? - That's what I want to ask. - You should return to your station. - It's too much for you alone. So I asked Uchida to assist me as well. To help you'? - You mean with the experiment'? - Hey... What you just injected her with... it's the same stuff you injected me with, no'? What are you talking about'? You think I didn't know'? An experiment'? You've been involved with a number of experiments, doctor. Now, this man is your guinea pig. To the field of medicine, all patients are guinea pigs. - It's so like you to say it like that. - Every doctor secretly thinks like that. Even if I follow procedure, patients will still die. That's why I did away with all that! I wanted to rebuild it all myself. That's not true. Something that was lying dormant inside you has emerged! I see. However... ...you are an obsessive clean-freak. - Even sexually. Extreme! - Stop it... That's why you need me. But then, you came along, Yajima. She was drawn to you. Something in her, apart from the sexual desire she feels towards me. I suppose, it was pure love. And the result of the heart and the body desiring different things... ...is that you hate me. What you say is probably correct, Doctor. But... ...the reason my obsessive cleanliness got so bad... is that, six months ago... ...| was raped at the copy-center. You... I never told anyone. - But it was so painful... - Stop it! Agonizing. That's enough! But the experiment is real. The medicine you said was for the hypothalamus damage... Those weren't male hormones. It was female hormones! So if you keep taking this medicine, your body will start to become female! So you also know that what I've been giving you is male hormones? In the beginning it was interesting. Even if I knew... - But... - This is your fault! To address your lack of exercise... Hey... The male hormones are working, no'? Put it down, put it down... It's the male hormones! Hey, stop! What are you gonna do'? It looks like my memory came back with that last blow. Call it shock-treatment, I guess. It was pretty intense though. Dr. Yoshimura... I finally understand. You were my target. What are you saying... You discovered the secret of one of your female patients. But she made a mistake. You had a pretty big organization backing you. You were tricking us'? - The memory-loss, it was all a lie'? - It was real. I was an assassin, on my way to complete an assignment. But on my way there I was assailed by a random attacker. Kaori... I wanted to lose my memories too. That's why I was holding onto this. Take this and they slip away. But now I realize... The one who should lose their memory... ...is you, Doctor. Hey! It's a very strong sedative. He won't die. But he won't exactly live, either. Put it down! The attacker who assailed me had that bat! Take me... Come on! Take me! Take me now! Right here! Take me! Ayawa Ikezawa heard her colleague Kaori Uchida talk about being raped... ...by a person with a red umbrella when working part-time at a copy center... ...before taking up her current position at the hospital. Ikezawa's obsessive-compulsive disorder.. ...led her to develop an extreme emotional sympathy with Uchida... ...and to develop delusions that she was the one who was raped. When her period coincided with a rainy day, she began to... ...madly and indiscriminately attack anyone she saw carrying an umbrella. She was later suspected of being the criminal who attacked people... ...with a meta! bat. White thankfuiiy no deaths occurred, it is certain that... ...there is great social responsibility in spreading uncertainty and fear. However, due to the conducted psychological exam... ...it was found that the accused was young and had suffered a trauma. She was declared not guilty but has to seek psychological treatment.
