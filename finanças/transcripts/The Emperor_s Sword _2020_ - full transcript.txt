For as long as I can remember. I often hear people talk about the great achievements of general Meng Tian. And his students the "Seven Gentlemen". The wisdom man, Guan Xiang-Shu; polite man, Bai Ling; virtuous man, Bail Ru; valour man, Tie Chui; brave man, Jilian; vigour man, Tian Chang-Lu; and the wise man, Lian Zi. Assisted him. Achieved notable merits, and praised by the world. 50 steps. Shoot! Emperor Qin Shi-Huang unified China. Established the Great Qin Dynasty. Used the words from the Three-Emperors, and Five-Kings to constitute the name "Huang Di". And called himself the First Emperor. In order to hold the wish of all ages in Qin Dynasty, the sword of Emperor Qin was divided into two parts. The most famous craftsmen was called upon to recreate the sword. One was put in the E-Fang Palace. Named E-Fang Dinggqin. The other sword at general Meng Tian's protection. It was named Guangtai Dingqin. The man who possesses both swords may conquer the world. After the unification of the world, the Seven Gentlemen retired into the valley of Red Wind. However, peace only lasted ten years. The First Emperor died. Zhao Gao took away the imperial power. Killed the prince and loyal ministers. In order to possess the two swords, he's willing to sacrifice everything and kill anyone. And I am... the witness to the history that is not known to posterity. Run! Help! Go! Chase them! Go! Be sure to give the sword to the tomb keeper of Qin. Go now! The oil is flammable. Get back! You're awake? Here's your sword. Meng Xue is lucky to be saved by the hero. Thank you very much! You don't have to be so polite. Jilian is ashamed. If only I was there earlier, probably could've saved more people. You're one of the Seven Gentlemen? Jilian? Everyone at Meng's was killed. You're too young to be alone with this sword. What's your plan? Father's dying wish is to hand the sword to the tomb keeper of Qin. By that time, the world depends on the people. Now the whole city is on martial law. Zhao Gao has a great confidence to seize Dingqin sword. How do you protect the sword on your own? You get some rest first! I'll escort you out of the city tomorrow. Just a bunch of bereaved dogs. Lord Zhao! Why couldn't you finish the job? Meng's 47 family members pleaded guilty and was executed. Only the daughter, Meng Xue, got away with the sword. Commander Tian, how did a little girl got away? Did you show mercy on her? Commander Tian! Your Majesty thinks highly of you. You must live up to his expectations. My lord, Commander Tian must be working too hard. I'm willing to take on the task. The four masters ended up like this. There must be someone behind it. In that case, more men are needed to strengthen the defense. Commander Tian! I'd like to share that responsibility with you. OK! Let it be Chen! According to the emperor's will, people can die. The sword must stay. Yes my Lord! Stop! What are you holding? - What's this? - Take it away. Act accordingly! Get out of the way...! Get out of the way! Your Majesty has orders. The city is in lockdown in search for Meng's rebels. Disobey orders and will be executed. Ah... We want out of the city... What should we do? Run! What's going on here? Run! Your hand! Hahahaha... Commander Tian. Good aim! My Lord! What should we do next? Hunt them down! You follow me after the rebels. Yes my lord! Coming! I'm coming! Sir, your wine. - Any seats? - Yes! come in! It's always the same. Who? - Lianzi, come and help. - Jilian! Who is this? She's hurt badly. Daughter of Meng's. I'll get the medicine. Try to endure the pain, I'm pulling out the arrow. Leaving without saying goodbye again? Anywhere could be home. You know how I am. I'm used to my freedom. Besides... I have more important things to do. Have you ever thought about settling down? Why don't you ask about the arrow? It's none of my business. There's nothing to ask. The world was supposed to be peaceful. The Seven Gentlemen retiring. But only for a few years. Zhao Gao took away the imperial power. The Mengs were all killed. The world is going to be at war again. I'm afraid we can't save ourselves. Protect her to Red Wind Valley. Guan Xiang-Shu will know what to do. When will you be back? On the 3rd day of March. - Don't touch my sword! - ... I didn't. - What are you doing here? - Sis, it hurts! Fortunately, the wound was alright. Pack your bags, we're headed back to the valley. I can meet my foster fathers and the others? I'll take the girl, you take the sword. No mistakes! All right! Do you want to eat or stay? Have you seen a man and woman with a sword? No sir! Stop! What's in your hand? Under the law of the Qin Dynasty, the people are not allowed to carry weapons. Disobey and be killed. You don't know this? Get down here! Han Jue, I asked you to hand over the pledged weapons to the government. Since they're already here, what are you waiting for? - Xiao-Liu, bring the rest of the swords. - OK! My Lord! I'm just a woman on my own that runs a hotel in the middle of nowhere. It's really not easy. Sometimes guests don't have the money on them, so the weapons are used as collateral. These are all outlaw people. This convenience must be provided. Lianzi always obeys the law. My Lord! You must know, we are all good citizens. My Lord, you've come a long way. I'll prepare some rooms for you. Lead the way! Xiao-Liu! Take the guests to their rooms. This way please! These officials have no good intentions. Now the sword has been taken away, I'm afraid we can't leave at this moment. Ding Qin Sword must not fall into the hands of others. Don't worry. I'll distract their leader tonight. Han Jue, you steal the sword back. It's not safe for you to be here. - Take her to the underpass. - OK! Don't worry, I'll get the sword back. There is a passages to the outside. You wait for me here. I'll steal the sword back. Are you scared? During the war years, bad guys are ruthless. What's the use of being scared? My Lord! Everything's arranged. Something's not right with this place. - We have to be more careful. - Yes my Lord! Be alert tonight. I'll be with the proprietress. Although Lord Wei is an official, but you have a chivalrous spirit. It is an honor to meet you and propose a toast to Lord Wei. I've been an official for so many years, but know so little about the outlaws. You are flattering me. Lord Wei is young and promising. And a good drinker. I'm a little drunk. Where's that guy at your hotel? He has rested. The woman at your service... has also rested right? Cheers! Where's the sword? Where is the Dingqin sword? Lord Wei! How do I protect myself in this day of age? Since we have the honor to meet. Let me just say this... conform to the trend. Come on! My Lord! That's enough drinking for tonight, I'm going to rest. Still have business to take care of at this hour? Good-bye! My Lord, this place is more dangerous than we think. I was in the proprietress's room, and found the arrowhead shot by Lord Tian. Someone's been here. Should we attack? Don't make a rash move. Fourteen Iron-Riders and the Four Masters all died in their hands. The person protecting the girl is no pushover. Call Nan Sheng over immediately. - You all, be alert at all times. - Yes sir! Are the Mongolian medicine ready? It's all in the wine. My Lord, my brother should be here by now. Maybe something went wrong with the carrier pigeons? A plate of Tian-Shan roasted pigeon. A plate of Tian-Shan roasted pigeon. It was just a misunderstanding... Misunderstanding my ass! Go... let's get out of here! Get the swords back quickly! Shut the doors! Grab the sword! Han Jue! Go! Go quickly! I'll be right behind. What's going on outside? Here's the sword. Han Jue! Go now! My Lord, there's a underpass. Meng Xue! Be careful! Aunt Lian, go with Meng Xue. - I'll hold them back. - You be careful! We'll meet up ahead. Let's go! - Be careful! - Brother! Where are they? My Lord, there are archers on the other side. It's foggy ahead, we shouldn't go after them. You stay here. I'll report to Commander Zhao. Ah... We have arrived to Red Wind Valley. I'll call for him. Father San! You're back. Put it here. You should buy a cow. Buy a cow? What would I be doing? Who is this girl? And where's Xiao-Liu? He promised me a good bottle of wine. What happened? Let's discuss it inside. Come with me this way. From the battlefield to now retiring in the valley, do you feel any grievances? Now I finally have the time to play Guqin, I couldn't be happier. Having you by my side, I am more than satisfied. Brother...! Lianzi is back! Brother! This is Meng Tian's daughter Meng Xue. Meng's? - Jue, take her 10 Bail Ru to treat her wounds. - OK! Let's go! Father Bai, what's the point of playing chess by yourself? You're still a kid. You'll understand later. Bring her in. Father Bat's medicine is very effective but maybe painful. It's ok to scream. Perseverance is rare at such a young age. You've treated a lot of patients haven't you? During the chaos of war, swords and knifes are like toys to children. Human lives are so fragile. It's the least I could do. Is this why you chose to become a physician? Physicians treat patients, so a merciful man can save the common people. Knowing everything about the world, but to act the right way and have a sense of good vs. evil. The chess you played feels like a draw. It's amazing how much you understand at such a young age. Could you talk about something easy to understand? You'll understand when you grow up. You're younger than me. My Lord, it is my fault to not get the job done. We had the fugitives trapped in the hotel. But the opponents were too cunning, and escaped thru the underpass. It is all my fault. Please spare my life. You can't even catch a little girl. You are worse than Commander Tian. - Just stay by my side. - You are right my Lord. Indeed, I am not as meticulous as Commander Tian. I suggest Commander Tian take on the duty. He can solve all of our problems. As you can see, Commander Tian; the Qin Dynasty is depending on you for protection. Allegiance to Da Qin! Whatever takes! Good! You have three days to destroy the remaining sinners in Red Wind Valley. And retrieve the Dingqin Sword for the emperor. Yes my Lord! I will go now. Chen! Have Ghost Kill follow along. Yes my Lord! I object! Xiao-Liu lost his life protecting the sword. I'm just a doctor. Heal the wounded and save the dying. But this sword is a ferocious weapon. Made to kill. Doctors can save people, but it can't save the world. Brother, if we don't help her, I'm afraid the child will never make it to the tomb of Qin. We are not The Seven Gentlemen anymore. We are ordinary people living at the Red Wind Valley. Brother! Protecting the sword is my responsibility. Thank you for your help today. I will leave the valley now. Father! You can accompany general Meng in battles. Accompany the emperor to rule the world. But today, why can't you accompany a girl to escort the sword? Who's there? What are you doing here? I'm here to escort you to the tomb of Qin. Underestimating me? I'm a great archer, and I never miss. Escorting you would be an easy task. Only matter of time before I make a name for myself. Until then... Hey! Wait for me. You're only alive today because of me. Look! Aren't you afraid of the heavy fog? Commander Tian. Lord Ji has been waiting for you for a long time. Brother Ji! Commander Tian is now in a high position of power. I'm not sure if this heroic wine still suits you. We've been brothers for many years. Why would you say that? Meng's business, can you just leave it alone? I know you're the one that saved Meng's daughter. To seize the sword is to be the enemy of the Qin Dynasty. Can you stay out of this? The reason I'm willing to fight for the Meng's is because they care about the people. Loyal minister Lord Meng is now dead. His only daughter, Meng Xue; is the last member of loyalty and justice of Meng's. Do you really think I can leave it alone? Brother Ji! Today, we only talk about our friendship. No business. Struggle for power among emperors in those days. The seven of us fought together on the battlefield. And helped the first emperor rule the world. We could have gone down in history forever. But the others chose to retire into the valley. But you... didn't retire nor rejoin the military. You became a ronin. Living freely as you please. We will eventually be buried into the dust. Time will catch up to all of us. There will always be heroes in this world. And looking back, I am not the young me anymore. All of these years, you're still the same. Hasn't changed a bit. I haven't changed. You did! Have 1? You and I were born during the war. Suffering from exile. I just don't want to see more people go thru what we went thru. How is Lianzi? Good or bad, you should ask her yourself. I thought you two are together. We are not meant for each other. She already had someone in her heart. The fact is she and I... Let's just drink. Must get drunk today. Meng Xue is young but she has a strong will. Bai Ling! I do this, is it right or wrong? You drove her away but have Han Jue to escort her. The Guqin you played sounds messy, but you've already made your decision. If that's the case, why ask if its right or wrong. I thought we could spend the rest of our lifes in this valley and not care about the outside world. But the treacherous minister has caused chaos. How long can we stay out of it? Be careful! They can't be too far. Let's go! Be careful! Meng Xue, get down. Go first. I'll hold them back. I'll stay and help. Don't worry, I'll catch up soon. Go! Go! Be careful! Bei Yue! Push! Try again! It's still early. Have patience. Finish your meal and lets go home. Run...! Run, quickly! Take care of Bai Ling. All of you, stand down. Lianzi, where's the girl? Where is the Dingqin sword? Commander Tian, can you do this? I could replace you. Lianzi, please don't do this. I don't want to see you end up like your brothers. Hand over the Dingqin sword, I'll let you live. Let me live? You've put everyone here at a dead end. I beg you. Please spare the child. When people die... what does it feel like? Death! Maybe you won't feel anything. I've heard the leaves say... when the wind blows, it doesn't know when it'll leave the ground, or when it'll land. But at that moment, it feels free. Everything in the past has been past. People are born between heaven and earth. Just like the blown leaves. Wind stopped, everything gets settled. No more missions, no more regrets. Only a moment of peace and ease. You're just like Father Bai. Saying things that people don't understand. So... do you have any regrets? Yes! But what can I do? Father had taught me since childhood, to have a kind heart, not to be selfish and always think of others. Only in this way can we be worthy of the word "Loyalty". And make life worthwhile. You're finally here! Do you remember March the 3rd, is Lianzi's birthday? I know. But her birthday, turned out to be the date she died. You killed her. Lord Zhao is devoted to assist the Second Emperor. I'm not gonna let you kill him. Today, he has to die. You will die too. Today will be our final battle. Lord Zhao has ordered to kill him. Kill kill kill...! The tomb of Qin should be ahead. Why are there so many dead soldiers? Are these guards tomb keepers? Be careful! The bottom of the cliff is covered with mercury. It's dangerous! The blood on the ground is new. Seems like this just happened not too long ago. But why did the Qin army want to kill the tomb keepers? Meng Xue! It's ok. I'll help you up. Don't cry. Let's look around. There may be survivors. Solar eclipse. Han Jue! Han Jue! Han Jue! Will there be a day without war? No killings? People live and work in peace. Everyone lives in a beautiful land like a paradise. Born in a peaceful world. And leave harmoniously. I'm sure there will be a day! Lord Xiang-Yu, the palace? Burn it! Who is he...? Emperor Han! This is the person I recommended. Xiao-He, who is he? I'm willing to provide my loyalty and service, to help the emperor of the Han Dynasty. Conquer the world!
