(laughs) And are you certainly sure she doesn't have a boyfriend? What does it have to have? He is hanging around a sacristan. A sacristan? Well, then, it was not a stick but a Paschal candle. (laughs) Where is the girl? At home, crying over her misfortune. Do you leave her alone in this city? Come quickly, madam, before the sacristan repents and come back for leftovers. Take her to my Aunt Napolitana's house. I swear to you that your daughter will leave Rome just as she entered. Are you safe? I don't have to be. If I already sold a virgin three times and there were never lawsuits or suspicions. Go, it goes to good hands. -Thanks thanks. -Thank you, Rampon. Brothers, I'd better be somewhere else than this one. We asked about a short, blond deacon. -I have not seen him. - She has not seen it? Well, what are we going to do. (Bells in background) - Did you not see that deacon we are looking for? -Yes, Se�or. Oh, Se�or. �D�nde estar�? God bless the good Spaniards. Forgive me, father, and you, Sister Rosa, if I didn't go looking for you at the inn. Did you already receive the money from Spain? I'm not kidding, bro. Do you already have the bull prepared? Here I bring it. Do you bring the stamps? Bleeding the newly applied wax. And I still got another new grace from my monsignor friend: 100 more days of indulgence for everyone who prayed on their knees in your hermitage. But our hermitage is in Segovia, and here it says "Sevilla". By the holy Madonna! I already confused the place. �Qu� dec�s? That my friend monsignor that being Spain, one hermitage did not matter to another. That what matters is the intention and not the letter. Of. So either you pay me the six ducats, or I return with the bulls. Do not do such. I think the monsignor is right. Take. Thanks. Go with God. Greet Monsignor in our name. You will not escape, renegade deacon. So with the prayer you sold me My wife was going to cure her. Calm down, brother. What misfortune happens to you? For my life that will make you remember. "If it gave you pain in the vein, Pray to Santa Elena. If in the gum, to Santa Menc�a. Yes anywhere in the body. Saint Albert. To Saint Albert.

To hell, do I have to tell you again? that after giving birth, the mother is loose around her body moving like a snake. A serpent? (Sighs) Perhaps the sentence was too short for such a long pain. Do you really want me to heal once and for all? Why did I come if not? oh oh It is from a holy penance, my friend. Do you have ten quads there? You have to give them as necessary alms. Come on, remedy. Listen, smoke it from below with goat's wool. And if it doesn't go away, put it in the navel a poultice of galbanum, ammonia and incense. And I will come to your place. And, above all, don't get out of bed. until all the cold wind is expelled from the body. And this is how it has to heal, clean fart? A clean fart will have to be, brother. There is no other way. Goodbye. Oh! Stay with God, that for my good. Let your grace know, Mrs. Avionesa, that four things are worth nothing if they are not shared: The pleasure, the knowledge, the money and the pussy of the woman. (Laughs) Stop it, Neapolitan! I pee! 00:08:36,840,000000000058 --> 00:08:37,790,000000000058 What do you give me now? 136 so that teeth retain their whiteness. �A las clines, runner! "Time flies". God save them. Who is the péter? I didn't know you had orders. And now, don't shut your mouth. Wait your grace. Quick lathe. In my life I saw a crazy like you. Who are you running from now? Oh, my sinner. God help me. From whom do you want me to flee, if all of Rome is after me? Sad trade you taught me, aunt, always running away like a dog. Better I want to live on alms. Shut up, badass. This morning fortune entered our house. A brave Spaniard arrived who has been fleeing from her land. We sent madona Divicia. �Napolitana! Your grace wait, I haven't opened the liquor yet. Is she so brave? We will not have it better. I tell you that we will make her the prettiest courtesan in Rome. (Whining) �Napolitana! For the life of me I have not seen such a beautiful face no more gentle body. Where do you hide it? This is a bad piece to hide, which is alive like a lizard. She welcomes me, and I will put her in your hands to make you live as you deserve. We will. Go find her. It's on the stove, come on. (HE COMPLAINS) Forgive your grace. My nephew has just hung up his habits. Have you lost faith? God save you, mother Inés. How are you doing? My soul... God give you greater happiness than I loved. The humidity of this house is making me peel my head. Mother Inés, I would like to know how many dovecotes you have in there. Only a Spanish that is well worth 100. That fruit is not sold on the bridge. Yes? Is it so sweet? I am old, but seeing her naked made my 60th Christmas happy. What do you think if you let me see it? What do you think of five quadrines? Even though she's my relative? Being a relative more, because of the bond. I am here to ensure decency. Mother Inés, stop pimping, I know very well that most of them come here to wash their bodies and they come out dirty in soul for your ruffian trades. Take three squares and talk no more. Bueno. Where can you look? Where did the wood leave you? �Por ah�? S�. (M�sica espa�ola) Ramp�n. Ramp! But what are you still doing there? Body of the world, for my life, I have never seen better woman's flesh. Be careful, Rampon, that's a lot of empanada for a poor man. Hunger issues. Mine is wolf. (Puerta) I'm ready, mother In�s. (M�sica espa�ola) Hello, queen m�a. You come fresh and scented like a rose. (R�E) Who is this gallant, mother Inés? It's Ramp�n, Neapolitan's nephew, who has been waiting for you for a long time. My aunt said to come for you. He added that he would show you the city, if it pleased you. Of course! I like it very much. Let's enter Rome on the right foot. (M�sica alegre) (INAUDIBLE) (music continues) This is the neighborhood where the most famous courtesans live. We will find as many as hives. And where are they hiding? Well, there, behind the blinds. What is that woman doing? It's Dorothy. Show that listed cloth to warn the passerby, that the pigeon has already flown. Oh! Isn't it done the same in Spain? In Spain they fornicate at night and in secret. That is the only sin that counts for father confessors. And it is very prohibited? (nods) As prohibited as practiced. (R�EN) (Bells in background) Look, that is the house of the Wild Heron, favorite of a Calabrian duke. And that is Madonna Victoria the Desired. La Jerezana lived there, maintained by a Spanish nobleman. But how many courtesans are there in Rome? In Rome? 30,000 I have registered. Not counting pimps, covered and ruffians. �Ah! I vote san, that most of Rome is a brothel. From there they say their downfall will come. (R�E) (BOTH) Blood of Christ! How long have I not seen you! Y ahora que veo, "Glory to God in the highest"! By my life there will be no better roast on the table of the cardinals. Come on, let's find out about him. No, aunt, please, for me. I was fed up with the fish casserole and the kid with almonds. 00:17:05,680,000000000116 --> 00:17:07,930,000000000116 There will always be a corner for whatever comes. 242 Bring more wine. 00:17:10,400,000000000116 --> 00:17:10,900,000000000116 Come on. 244 How do you like my nephew? 00:17:15,160,000000000116 --> 00:17:15,860,000000000116 You like me, don't you? 246 00:17:18,319,999999999884 --> 00:17:19,319,999999999884 Do I have to say it? 247 Good God, with what you know and your cunning, 00:17:24,920,000000000116 --> 00:17:26,170,000000000116 Rome stepped on, Rome won. 249 You didn't tell me if you also knew sentences. �Oraciones, t�a? (R�E) I know how to ensalme, entrust the saints, remove the evil eye, and also palmistry and forecasting. I know how to enchant the tertian, read in the melted lead, I learned it from a Jew from C�rdoba, I know how to dress maidens and medicate the nature of women and men. And, above all, I know how to recognize people's foreheads his physiognomy and his intention. Do not declare your science to anyone that I alone is enough to sell that body and such profitable merchandise. And let the courtesans rage, that from now on the navel of Rome is here. Attest that there is no other in the world so beautiful. Here's to him! (R�EN) Let me, daughter, help you undress. (M�sica espa�ola) (YAWN) How about my nephew? Very good looking. Like a golden pine. He only has one defect, the poor guy. That is something apocadillo with women. Nice gift for a handsome man. (CHISTAN) (WHISPERS) Well? What happened? (WHISPERS) You have to sleep with her. He has a nice body! Slow down, don't scare her. Slow down, don't break the business. Come on! (M�sica rom�ntica) Here you lie? No, not here. I thought closer. �Qu� hac�is? Do you forget that I have a husband? He is not here now to see us. We will. Don't be so surly. Why don't you let this ferret... ...what hunts in that forest? What a scream. �Ya? Open the door for me and you will shout with more reason. How about this first bet? The speech took me away. Well this is nothing. You'll see later. Now you will know what a man is. �"By Our Lady"! Qu� buen seedal. (M�sica rom�ntica) �Duermes? What's wrong with you... love? I was dreaming... ...that also this second night you are mine. (M�sica alegre) Hey! Open your eyes, it's noon. But children, the sun enters through everything. Oh, love... That I am yours, dead or alive. Here I leave the food. Nephew. Nephew. I bring you black pudding, cheese and grapes. To the clinics, runner. (music continues) Luzana, daughter. What is this? This is how he sleeps since yesterday. Like a widow's suckling pig. That I didn't get up for not waking him up. Auntie, get him out of bed. For the life of me no. That if I were him, no one would get me out of that bed. Replenish yourself with these viands. Lozana, remember the proverb: "The money and the dale-dale, don't rush it". (M�sica rom�ntica) I have never served anyone but my own shamelessness. But if you let me stay with you, I will be a faithful dog and a servant for whatever it takes. I will be near you day and night, in case you need me. I'll bring home the lovers, if you want. And he will do it without more payment than friendship. Are you sure that jealousy will not come later to hinder everything? But what do you say? I can be as good a bastard as anyone else. Will you also know how to be deaf and dumb when appropriate? Who? me? That is my job. You will always know how to shut up even if I treat you like the vilest of servants? test me So, if you know how to serve with joy, I will have you as a king. And, after all, you will have the best part of Lozana. The one that the others will never have. But did the mother finally stop your wife? Of course, at the first plaster. What happens is that it does not stop venting, that I no longer resist it. Not if I don't deny it. The stone is of quality. Will it be worth 20 ducats? At most, ten. I can give you five. And not now. Does hunger bother you so much? It's not hunger. It's that I want to house a Spanish woman. It will not be one that accompanied Ramp�n. That same one. And I swear to you that I will check all the courtesans of Rome. �Seguro! Why don't you let me help you in the business? �Ayudar? �C�mo? I would put a house in the best of Rome, and I would take care of advancing clothes and dresses. Do you want to remove it from favorites? I am not for those trots. I would only put money in the body of that Spanish to get it out of the bag of others. �Me comprend�is? Clear as water, Mr. Wheat. You have just entered the enormous brotherhood of pimps. (R�EN) (M�sica dram�tica) Take a good look at this bed, it will be the main customs to dispatch the sweet merchandise of love. (R�E) I assure you, Rampon, there will be no other bed more beautiful or more productive in all of Rome. But what do you do? I'm wondering if those who come will not be scared seeing the house so empty. The important thing is the bedroom, that here no one will come to pray ejaculatory prayers. Take a good look, my son, how you manage this garden. Be calm, Wheat, that everyone will leave this house happy as Easter and squeezed like lemons. No s�. I have heard that in Spain, some fornicate for love. Bueno... I don't care what they usually do in Spain. But here, in this field of ours, none will play for nothing. I'm already fed up. (M�sica espa�ola) Close your eyes, I'm going there. But... body of the world. It's like a miracle. She looks like a queen! A fountain of gold! Well, tell me how to pay for this source of gold. I will send you whoever pays for it, and faith that they will make a procession. (R�E) Soon you will be the only one in Rome. And now, son, take this cloth to the balcony, that soon the starlings will come to claim. (R�E) (fun music) (INAUDIBLE) (music continues) (INAUDIBLE) (music continues) Oh, se or Masterroom. What an honor! Passage. (R�E) Is the lady here? Tell him Trigo sent me here. Wheat? The lady is already in bed. There I wanted to catch her, young man! Take him this chain and tell him to open me up. I'll go, sir, but I doubt I'll see you at this hour. Tell her, let's go! freshness Guess who is there. Who? The Maestresala. (LAUGHS) Give it to me. It comes like a grouse in heat. More sorrow. Make him come quickly. But be careful, you have to help him open the bag. He is very greedy. Greedier than Wheat? Wait, I'll take care of him. what did he say? and she will answer you. I have not come to speak! Here, between us, brother, I can only exercise once a month, and today the date expires. He will convince her to take out her hand and you could kiss her. How to kiss? �Cabalgar I intend! Yes, but I, understand... Six ducats, and get me in quickly, and I'll do the rest. Come in. And may God protect me if the lady gets angry with me. For the milk that mom! This is not a woman, brother, but a man-killing machine. leave me alone And in my bed your grace undresses? Well I can do it, what part I have in it. �S�? Three ducats I gave Trigo to pay for it. Take advantage of it, then, if it is yours. Can I kiss you now? Try it, Mr. Maestresala. What is your name? Perusino And by my faith that I have to be yours, and you mine. (Puerta) Excuse me. What the hell is going on? They come to collect the rent of the house. It's six ducats, they can't wait. Take them from my bag, but by all the heck, get out! Good sir. I will. Don't be angry, my love, my Perusino. Let me discover your charms. Sure, now everything is for you. Everything, everything. C'mon C'mon. (R�EN) No tickles! �What are you from Liorna? Oh little pigeon. Do you like it? Yes, ma'am, I like it. (SCREAMS) �Aire! �Aire! �Ramp�n! Two more ducats! They come to collect the Neapolitan ribbons. Come on, Rampon, stop with Neapolitan ribbons. What has given him a paralás! �Ven! �Ay�dame! Lord Mastersala! come back! What has happened to him? rampon... Call the servants, please, we are going to die here. Come on, hurry up! Is that you, palomica? Ah� lo ten�is. - Oh, sir. What's wrong with you? -�What�s happening to you? -My God. Carefully. (Sighs) But what did you do to him? What am I going to do? As usual. (Sighs) Your father already said it when he tasted it: This woman is a lot of empanada. A harangue for my father! Next month will not fail me. Sure! 00:34:10,239,999999999767 --> 00:34:11,139,999999999767 (Funny music) 488 - Do you want something bad, seora? Ponedme is also Like mandis, seora. Is that I hear a Spanish accent?

I would also like to tell you that from now on I am yours and... And I of another who awaits me in the car. This square has an owner, but don't worry, other countrywomen more sane than I will find their lordship, that in Rome there are at pleasure. Can I kiss your hand? It smells like Seville. Better to Córdoba la Llana. You already have a hawk for your pigeon. I wouldn't dare clip his wings, he has the bearing of a gentleman. Command me, lady, that I will be yours for everything. Allow me, my lord gets angry. (R�E) Oh, excuse me, but that gentleman did not like that I go with you for a snack. Why didn't you call me? He was the one who disagreed, I know. My faithful lamb. (Bells in background) �Eh! �Calma! Why? Seven times I went to offer presents, And seven o'clock Rampón told me that you were busy. And I would be, sir. Oh, you will not think that they were Rampon's tricks. I accepted the presents and summoned you for another day, but you didn't come. I couldn't go, because of my profession, that forces me to travel more than I want. Vain excuse. If you really loved me... Ask Trigo, how well I charged to see you. how? Does he also get money for seeing me? Just to see you, no What a good part I have in your house. No! Also the house? It smells to me that all of Rome has paid for it. Great thief! I have to take out his eyes. But not now, calm down. What matters is that we are finally alone, my love. Life of my life! I just can't! Wait. Play the game. It's your turn.

Dead or alive, it's best to get away from here. Hurry, to the car! Come on! C'mon C'mon. (M�sica dram�tica) What fears are those, Mr. Coridon? I tell you that there is no one in Rome who can remedy you better. But my demand is different. And keep in mind that nothing that is between a man and a woman is different. And she is a teacher in that subject. If you could see how he knows how to ensalm and cross, and read in the hand! And I'm not talking about spells and liquors or remedies to mend virgins.

But it doesn't matter. Remember Pelegr�n, who also had the nature of a woman and I changed it in bed. By Saint Nefija! Shut up for once! Mr. Coridon does not want a bed, but advice. Oh, excuse me, sir. Tell me how I have to help you. Auntie, please pour him some of that Greek wine. Sit down. Speak, you can trust me. Come on, get started. I came from my land, which is Mantua, for this reason. On the first day of May, I returned home mounted on my horse and silk and brocade dress. (OFF) "The maidens I saw fell in love with me and they all threw roses at me. (M�sica on�rica) "Suddenly, I saw her at the window. It was sweet Polidora, who had stolen my heart. I threw a rose at her and told her, like every morning: 'I am Coridon, your enamored servant'. She took the rose and, full of blush, left the window." (music continues) "I followed her anxiously to the garden, and there I took her in my arms. Cupid launched his sweet dart and made of the two spirits a single heart. Our parents arranged the wedding and we were the happiest engaged. But oh, sad me, that's where my misfortune began. The rich Castruccio, threatening the parents, me arrebat� a Polidora". And although it is hard to believe, this is my unhappy story. And where does your beloved live now? He keeps her locked up in Mantua among old maids who guard it night and day. Please, madam, help me reach her. One hour, one minute only. I will pay you what you ask. Be careful, I know what to do for you. Aunt, take him with you and do with him what we did with the temple. Can you do something? We will have a good remedy. Come with me, Mr. Coridon. �Lozana! �Lozana! �Al�grate! (R�EN) I bring good news: we got rid of a death. The Spanish ferret is alive and kicking. Are you sure? Sure. Listen... Listen to me well. Don Sancho de Villaf��ez is called. He is from Toledo, he arrived in Rome a week ago to marry an Italian cousin, goddaughter of his uncle the inquisitor. Do you know when the wedding is? Three days from now. In the inquisitor's palace All they do is enter solicitors and notaries. And another new better one: Do you know how much Trigo offers me for the dagger? Six ducats! Six ducats, Lozana! Little is for what I intend to do. Listen, Lozana, it's stolen. Wheat is the only one that can buy it from us. And who talks about selling? I will charge the miradicas of that Don Sancho. We will do business and, by the way, we will improve our property. Do you want to do business with the dagger... ...or see don Sancho? The maiden is already composed. Oh, what a beautiful popcorn. Where did you get this glory? Do you like it? Put it under me and I'll tell you later. (R�E) Oh, do you see, sir? Disguised this way I promise I'll take them to Polidora. And trust that you will enjoy it before the very beard of her husband. Mrs. Lozana, I will never be able to repay you for this favor. How ever? Before leaving for Mantua. Money in one hand and deals in the other. Ramp�n. Come to your judgement, what are you thinking? Let it be captain or chicken, could make good broth for a hungry man. (R�EN) Oh, Angela, look at me if my hair is well groomed. There will not be in all Rome a bride like you. -The gloves, where are they? -Here, ma'am. Are you ready, niece? Let me see you. My son will not be able to defend himself against so much beauty. -Is he here yet? -In the courtyard awaits us. But do not rush. In Castile it is said: "Show your husband the flake, but little by little." Se�or. Two Spanish ladies request to see you urgently. -We are at a wedding, come back tomorrow. -I've told him, but they insist that this is precisely why they need to see you. I'm going now. Excuse me for a moment, daughter. -Yes, uncle. Oh me! I kiss the hand of your mercedes. Oh my, Don Rodrigo! Take me! That here I drop dead! �Qu� hac�is, se�ora? Tell me your grace the cause of your affliction, What will I do to remedy it? (CRIES) Lost I am, sir. No one can save me but you. (CRIES) �Bastard of m�! Calm down, seora. Lord, I can't with so much affliction. What happens to you? Tell me. (CRIES LOUDLY) Stop hiccuping, lady, we're having a wedding. For me it is a day of mourning, sir. Say, by God and all the saints, what misfortune afflicts you? That if it is in me to alleviate her, in faith as a gentleman I will do it. Calm down. We, sir, have just arrived from Toledo. From there all my misfortunes are born. Yes, come on, go on. It is about your son, Don Sancho. �Ay! He stole her flower! He dishonored her! What does this lady say? The truth! As certain as I am to die. He wrote me letters, he besieged me at all hours. But seeing himself rejected by me, He entered my house when I was alone... �Ah�, ah�! �Ah� here, I vote for...? Yes. He threatened me with a dagger, and reached with villainous force what he had not been able to achieve with courtesy. �No! Shut up for once! Here is the dagger. That is why we have come, sir. To stop the wedding, to prevent this infamy. It can't be! Everything is prevented, the bride awaits. Maybe you are wrong. Come with me. (carriage background) Could you point me to my son? The one who kisses the lady's hand. I swore I'd never see him again, my God! I believe you, ma'am. The action belongs to my son, and unfortunately, not the first. �C�mo os llam�is? Teresa. Teresa of Ávalos. I know, my lady. That the veil of honesty, once broken, it is not easy to compose. But my son is getting married now. You only have two paths: Go into the chapel and ruin everything, or admit a completed reparation. �Cu�nto? No s�... If I have to become a nun, You will need at least 2000 ducats in dowry. There are more here, but it seems fair to me. Take them and forgive me, if you can. (You indistinct) I'm ready, godfather. I'm going, daughter. Lady, go with God. We will. The Castilian left happy. I fulfilled as a perfect gentleman. There will be club, whole doubloon, and here they are. (R�EN) Mr. Castruccio is coming now. (Puerta) awaited What is going to happen? Don't worry, now we're in the house. Sure you can trust. In addition to the letters from the superior of the Poor Clares, has innocence written on his face. Now we will see. Is this the maiden? This is it, Mr. Castruccio. Judge you of his garments. Oh, I'm not convinced. It's very young. The mother Águeda said that it was not good that your wife lived surrounded by old people. Is that what the mother Águeda said? No, he meant the servants. Ah, and what does the girl know how to do? All, sir. Spin, sew, embroider, prepare flakes and also pesti�os, syrup and quince jam. Sweets make me sick. Oh sir. Clumsy of me. Well, in addition, he knows how to make noodles, empanadillas, casserole with its garlic and its cominico. You, ac�rcate. D�selo t�, hija. See how discreet and quiet she is. It's just what your grace needs. �C�mo os llam�is? Beatriz. Bad start. I don't like the name. You can put another one, sir, like in the convent. And what is all this going to cost me? A little alms for the good of the soul, the altar fell on us. Take. With this you can return to Rome. I am fed up with shouldering one more mouth. (Campanilla) Does the deal suit you? Well you can go. Accompany the mother and bring in the maiden's valise. I and the convent are bound. Now that we close the deal, I tell you that you arrived like rain in May. Because in three days I have to be in Milan for a long season. So your wife is cared for and attended to in everything. Not so our poor and dilapidated altar. Pedigree nuns... Take another reinforcement and leave. Thank you sir. God give you what you deserve. So be it, sister. (Puerta) Dime... Wouldn't you know how to cook a stoned kid for me too? I will try to please you in that, sir. In that alone? Leave me, sir. �Por qu�? No one told you that you are tasty morsel... ...and dangerous? Just looking at the bird makes me happy. �Cuidado, se�or! What treacherous eyes. (R�E) �Por favor! (Puerta) Take the maiden to the lady's chamber for you to meet her. "Bocatto de cardinal!". Mr. Don Castruccio sends you the new maid. Get her in. Pasad. (M�sica rom�ntica) Quiet, my love. I'm already with you. -Oh, my soul. Tell me I'm not dreaming. -You are not, for my life. I am Coridon, the one who with blind faith, with tears, pains and fatigue loves you and will always love you, because you are carved in my heart. I want you to be mine. And I will be yours. Now. (music continues) (Door closed) Polisher. Little heart of her husband. I want to enter. Sir, I am lying down with a severe headache. Let me in, I'll take care of you. The maid is already attending to me. (Sighs) But how are you going to compare? Open, open. It's just a little bit. Just a little bit! You will see what medicine I bring you. I already have medicine to cure me, "my dear". �Ma�ana! �Ma�ana! �Basta of! You don't have plenty of scandals in Spain that you still come to bring them here? I swear I have nothing to do with this. �No? And this dagger? How did that woman have it? Don't you think that a scandal would have ruined your wedding? Atended, se�or. I'm not going to tell you about this arranged wedding despite myself and against my wishes. It is already done and well done it is. But I swear on my faith that this dagger was stolen from me. I have nothing to do with this deception. You mean...? ..that you have been outwitted by that cunning Spaniard. I vote with God that will move heaven and earth. And by my faith I have to send her to the galleys! Do nothing, sir. Let me come back from my honeymoon, What will I do to find her? Are you sure you didn't abuse her? I swear to you, se?or. What's wrong with you? Anything. �Nada? For some time you have changed, you are not the same. What's wrong with you? Any. What do you want to happen to me? I predicted it, Ramp. One day jealousy will come to hinder everything. �Recuerdas? I can be as good a bastard as anyone else. Have you forgotten? No. I'm not. Dime... Are you sure you always go to bed for pay? Who are you referring to? To nobody. Oh, Rampan. You do not deceive me. That goes for Don Sancho. S�. It may be because of him. Dime... It was jealousy what I saw the other afternoon... ...in your view... ...when he seemed dead? No. -Look how wonderful, princess. It is the work of a great Florentine master. How it stands out on the whiteness of the skin. Miraos en este espejo. I have another jewel for you, Don Sancho: this stone. At 100 ducats, it's yours. Examine it here, in the window. (IN A LOW VOICE) Another jewel I want you to show me. But fresh and gallant as a rose. how? Do you return from weddings in that spirit? I am not a one woman man. �Qu� me contest�is? I have the most beautiful and loving courtesan in Rome. When will you show it to me? Tomorrow, if you want. I want. I will warn you. I buy you the necklace. Set the stone to make it look better. "Dear" husband, how happy I am. If we were married longer, I would think that you were covering up some infidelity. (R�E) God keep you in good humor, madam! I am quite sure that I will never see Don Sancho's first infidelity. (R�EN) (Sinister music) "My soul, your soul" Put your hand in, take out the spike. Stag horn, beaver foot, go away, enemy, the Lord is coming. Did you notice something? A little heat on the papo. Do not worry, that is the lead that is working. Say your evil. I am friendly with a groom. Amistad or loves? Loves, yes. I mean we lay together one day and another later. Corporal passion is called that. �Qu� m�s? It's been a month since the very forgery has come to the house. I want to know if he's involved with another. let me see (M�sica suspense) Your man has no evil. I see... ...that is detained. But I can't know... ...whether it's a woman's or a bailiff's. I can't see it. It will take three more ducats. And how? If I brought you the black hen and the capon rooster and seven eggs for the spell. And after having my legs open for an hour you leave me with that? It is an expensive spell. Tomadlo. Now I do. Now we are in the astrological order. I see. He sighs next to a woman. And why do you sigh? Now we will see. I will pass the rooster with the knife. We'll soon find out. He brings the rooster. Don't mistreat him, we have to put him in pepitoria. (M�sica suspense) I see the naked woman. He bites her. So he hates her. I don't know yet if it's a bite of rage or love. I don't care, I just want to know if he'll come back to me. The spell cannot tell. That is for another day. Six days ago I arrived and I still have not found a woman worthy of taking to bed. Is this how this paradise of Venus is? Looking for a woman in Rome without a bawd is like going hunting without a hawk. And do you know any pimp? A Jewish friend has promised me the most beautiful female in Rome. I'll ask for another one for you. (M�sica alegre) Leave me, I'll see you later. (Bells in background) (M�sica tensi�n) (door bangs) �Don't escape! (SCREAMS) Don't run away! Did you think that I was not going to find you? (music continues) �Perra! Tell me who took your honor away! Let me go! (Screams) I have to take you to the gallows! �Cobarde! Dead you will get me out of here! Don't make fun of me! (M�sica rom�ntica) I didn't think that we would finally meet like this. 01:08:16,399,999999999534 --> 01:08:16,899,999999999534 My love... 1032 Here, I want to give you this ring. No, I was very well paid. You'll be better off that way. This time Lozana gave herself for her pleasure. 01:08:36,279,999999999534 --> 01:08:36,829,999999999534 Do you believe me? 1037 I want to believe it. (Sad music) 01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,190,000000000466 Blood of Christ, how long has it been since I've seen you! 1040 01:09:18,319,999999999534 --> 01:09:19,369,999999999534 And now that I see you... 1041 "Glory to God in the highest!" 01:09:25,399,999999999534 --> 01:09:25,899,999999999534 (R�E) 1043 01:09:30,680,00000000466 --> 01:09:31,180,000000000466 Hum... 1044 (laughs) Damn such a life. (laughter continues) (music continues) (Sighs) I didn't love her. Me conoci�. (barking) (laughs) We rials, cuckolds! This is not a laughing story. Yes, despite such with whom I gave birth. I swear to you that there is no other bellaca like her nor with so much smoothness. Mi embuster�a... She arrived here poor and full of misery and now they call her "Señora Lozana". Mrs. Lozana! Yes, brothers, believe me, I even called him more than once. Body of the devil, what a strong soul! He lies to everyone... ...promises, certifies and deceives. If you could only see how money runs in torrents in that house. From those who do not pay, they extract, they do not forgive term or interest. Yes, brothers, that woman is like that. There I have lived like a king. Like a king... And being an old dog, how do you stop liking all that? Yes, Olivero, I leave it and a thousand times I would leave it again. I don't want to be a bitch's tail anymore, nor a panties guard, nor pampered goat, nor herd other people's beds. I am Rampan! An old dog! That is, an old dog that no longer allows itself to be bitten. And do you know why, Seveneconics? Well I know. If there is no shepherd to defend it, the dog dies. That's it. You said well, brother. There is no longer a shepherd. The shepherd is over. The dog licks its own ass. And was it that gentleman we beat who kicked you out? No, on my life! No one kicked me out, I took off. Not to see his pigish face as an inquisitor's nephew anymore. Inquisitor's nephew... Do you know where I go to the Holy Office? Don't make those faces. You're scared, huh? I do not. The inquisitor does not dare with me. Little things I know about the inquisitor's family. �Ad�nde vas? �Quieto, cag�n! I scream because I can. I left the tongue tie in my mother's womb. And I'm not screaming because they stole my chicken, how well stolen it is. But because there are sets in which if one does not scream, it bursts! That's why I scream! A fig for the Holy Inquisition! Dates taken. �Preso dec�s? This is the end. �A qu� esper�is? Take him to Torre Nona. Goodbye, friends. Goodbye, brothers. The dog has a master again. This is where Rampon ends! Goodbye, friends! (Puerta) It's me, aunt. �En qu� trabaj�is? I prepared this ointment for the eyebrows that Madonna Clarina asked me to do. and you? Are you so finished that lovers throw you out of bed? How early is this? �D�nde est�? �Qui�n? your nephew. You must know it and not me, who lives in your shadow. Are you sure you didn't sleep here? You mean I didn't sleep at your house? He hasn't shown up all night. Don't worry, I'll be raging around there. Aunt... I'm scared. Last night I dreamed that I killed one and they arrested him. And do you listen to dreams? You who invent a thousand every day. Other times I have dreamed... ...and it has always come out true. Will it not be another to sing? Tell me, what have you done to him? What do I have to do? Why? You know, but these days he was on the run and suspicious. Lush... Don't blame the poor guy, he doesn't deserve it. S�... I am old leather and a teacher in brown grammar. When it comes to love, we women know how to swim and put away our clothes. But I'm afraid my nephew has lost his and walks around naked. (Puerta) Ay, se�ora Napolitana. I bring bad news of your nephew. My God, what happened to him? The bailiffs took him last night. They dragged him away. Then they came for me and for Sieteconicos but we were already 100 leagues away. Give me a glass of wine, I'm dry. But who did he kill? What did he do? Blaspheming the Holy Inquisition, and shouting like crazy. I don't know what lawsuits he has with the nephew of an inquisitor, that to me it makes me a matter of horns that there is no God who understands it. He was burning with jealousy. He, who ran to the girls with his pants. Oh, bitter me. They have taken him as a heretic. Heretic? But if there is no night that he does not say his ten Hail Marys. You know it well that you sleep with him. A bad end awaits him. People only leave Torre Nona for the gallows or for the bonfire. No. Can not be. No ir�. What if he went to prison for the inquisitor's nephew... ...inquisitor's nephew will have him taken out. (Bells in background) It's late, I think we should go find him. C�lmate. Vendr�. (Puerta) Of est� ah�. Please open... ...and leave us alone. (Puerta) Don Sancho... What's going on? They have arrested him, he is imprisoned in Torre Nona. Salvadle, se�or. Who has been arrested? To my servant. He was drunk, they arrested him in the tavern for denying the Holy Office. But you haven't done anything, sir. He is as much a heretic as you are a Turk. Lush... In what shady steps do you see yourself by your will? Don't you understand that this is not the life you deserve? It's the one I have, sir. Reconsider, Lozana. Today he has been your servant, tomorrow he will be you. Despite your beauty, any day you will end up like him: in prison or on the gallows. Listen... I am going to return to Spain. Drop everything and come with me. In Toledo you will not have to bear more sadness than mine. You will live in a palace like a great lady, and you will have me continually in love. Salvadle, se�or... ...and it will be yours. Do you love him? Yes... you love him. That is your sentence. With that you will have neither life nor rest. Will you talk to your uncle? In agreement. If it is as you say, your servant will be free. Thanks thanks. Lush... Didn't you ever wish for a better life? A better... life? S�. Do you say it with regret? No, I say it already happy. Will you be ready to leave in five days? S�. Gracias. (Music drums) (Puerta met�lica) I am free... I am free... �Soy libre! �Soy libre! Come. I do not can. Where has he been? But are you sure they've released him? I am. This morning I received this ticket from Don Sancho. Who was going to tell you that the Holy Office would it be charged in your beautiful meats? Don't worry about that hustler. He'll be running around getting drunk to celebrate his freedom. (door bangs) �Abrid, t�a! �Ramp�n! �Alegr�a! �Sobrino! (R�EN) Sobrino... (Sighs) They finally released you. Enters. Come in, you won't look clean with all the Tiber water. And where have you been, bujarr? Why didn't you come earlier? I feared that it was a trap of the Holy Office to lose me. That's why I waited until now. Don't you have anything to say to him? He's been waiting for you all day. Ramp�n... I'm hungry. Dirty and disgusting louse! So I see you at the stake of the Inquisition. Encorozado and burned his process. So pay all my sorrows and anguish. I have not asked you for anything. �Nada? �Oyes, t�a? He does not ask, but everything seems little to him. Your grace has become very demanding. What new whim do you want now? I want nothing. The guts left me to serve you. I was the most publicized cuckold in Rome and I endured it smiling. I didn't care if they made fun of me: "There goes Ramp�n, the spoiled one." You don't know what that is, of course. But I am not iron. Don't look at me like that. I was consented but I knew that the best part of the egg was sucked by me. To eat another and leave me the leftovers as alms, I prefer not to be more of a bastard. You'll look for me when misery eats you up. The mistake. That I no longer have the brains in my fly. Show off, you stray dog! �Escucha! Here we start, Lozana. Here we say goodbye forever. You to your bed, I'll delude myself like before in the square, but one thing is more certain than the sun that shines on us, and I tell you in Latin: "Think ungrateful, you will not enter my body." Listen, stubborn... The story is over. Leave away. (CRIES) You messed with her, nephew. You forget that no one leaves Torre Nona if it is not for the gallows. I already know. And do you know who got you out of there? Who? the inquisitor His nephew Don Sancho asked him. It is written by God in heaven that all the paths that open to me They always lead me to be cuckold. (M�sica alegre) (music continues) (music continues) (Applause) (R�E) Don't throw away the gold, Lozana, which in Spain may be lacking. There it does not run so easy. What is mine I can throw away, how well earned it is. Of course, you won it as a perfumer, a prostitute and a pimp. Three very honorable trades. (laughs) Do you love me, Don Sancho, even knowing what I am? That excites me more and makes me fall in love. Don't you think I can set fire to Toledo? I would like to die in that bonfire. (R�EN) Don Garc�a, I congratulate you. Madonna Divicia, you are a brave courtesan, rich! Yes? How nice, another beautiful courtesan. Me, a stranger, if they give it to me, I'll goof, goof. �Listen everyone! I say we drink for Lozana, now that someone else is taking her away. I toast on behalf of those who enjoy it, of those who were wisely deceived, of those to taste spoiled, of the marked and cuckolded. She was faithful to all and she was faithful to none. That this is how the wise courtesan must be. Because bitch that one only wants well, Satan take her. �Am�n! (laughs) The other choruses are missing, se�or valijero: "Whore what a good fart loose, can not be but brash." (laughs) I say, where will that Rampón be? Night lover, secret friend and future husband. It's where your bitch mother! My mother is with yours, who is a prisoner of pimping. Third! You are not worth even to sell yourself! Who says it? �Sacabragas! (Rampage) (R�EN) (R�E) �M�sica, come! So the pigs eat you! (riot, music) You dirty whore! bitch! Pimp! Brother, this is not medicine that does heal, well, and if not, God help you. These are the remedies that quickly restore health and cure the plagues of the body. Powders to cure French disease, waters to restore the freshness of the face, ointments to peel the eyebrows and beards of widows and single women. Friends, here is Rampan, who always heals the sick, improves the healthy and restores joy. Do you know any remedy against horns? I smell that my wife is haunted by a marzolino sacristan. Sacristan, brother? So, there is no spell that will work for you. You will have some remedy. Remedy I have. Do you have eight quads? Gracias. Do you know what it's worth? But this is a bag sewing needle. Well, I won't tell you more. things, hermano, things, and there will be no dinguilindón that harasses you. (laughs) The table, with the vase and the chairs, three ducats. I offer you a good price. How three ducats, if you sold them to me for 15? I would rather not buy and that you stay in Rome. For the tapestry I can pay you more. What would the valijero and Mr. Maestresala say If they saw that today what you charged them so much is worth nothing? Let be. He will raise three more ducats in the lot. And those fabrics? Stay with them, aunt, you have them well earned. Peace be in this house. Come in, don't stay there. I'm going to show you the mirror. Mrs. Lozana, I come for you. I am going to prepare the trip and I have just enough time. Let's go home, Pelegrina. The physicist already predicted my illness. Well, the doctors will know more than Mrs. Lozana. Help me, I want me to see my husband. You come at the wrong time, he is leaving for Spain. It will be bad for me... Mrs. Lozana, for the blessed souls, attend to him before you leave, do not leave me with my sorrow. What's wrong with you? My husband... What hurts? No, it's not pain but the fountain of joy grew cold. I don't know, it's a bad thing to remedy. Wait here. -Pilgrim... -What? Let's go, I don't want all of Rome to make fun of my evil. �Are you hurt? The bedroom will be priced separately from the other things. Even out of respect for what he rented us both. Look, lady, at this meapilas of my husband who hasn't met me for a year. And with the others does he comply? He says no. Take him to the physical. She already saw it, and assures that it is not worth it. What is not worth? (R�E) He says it's not worth it! You see it, aunt. And let him pay you two ducats. I will gladly give them to know if my man is worth it or not. Come on, I want to see your nature. But is that... Come on, pich�n. Oh, Saint Nefija, may my body rejoice again! For the tapestry, four ducats. Not for sale, Wheat. He goes with me to Toledo. Are you sure of what you are doing, Lozana? S�. I am. Nothing keeps me in Rome anymore. Come, I still have things to sell. Yes. Now you will know if it is worth or not. (fun music) �Ya? Voucher. What is it worth? Yes, it revives as soon as it changes body. That is your bad. Well, it won't be my mother's daughter who will look for a remedy. (Bells in background) Does it hurt you to leave this? Much. I understand. Come up. �Ah! �Ah! Bye, Wheat section. Know that I do not hold a grudge against you for your dealings. Do not do more, how fair they were. Adi�s, t�a. I will always remember what you did for me. Always. Oh cheer up that face. That there is no absence that lasts 100 years. Goodbye, daughter. Here we will always be waiting for you. Remember those who loved you well. We will. Please, aunt, don't cry to me, I'm not worth that much. Adi�s. �Ah! Our source of gold dried up. Another sorrow eats me that not that of greed. As you can see, I have just lost a daughter. �Hermanos! Pay attention to Rampon, because he never deceived you. He never gave you a false word for true. Here I bring mallow root for bad teeth, powders to charm the worm and tapeworm, quartan pills. herbs for cough and syrups to move the body, ointment for the itching of maidens, and balm to calm the mother. Come, brothers! Here is Ramp�n with his remedies that restore health and cure the plagues of the body. I bring prayers for a good marriage and to give birth the first year. I have Greek liquor to blind husbands and calm restless widows. Have you any ointment for blind lovers to see? No, se�ora. There are no ointments or remedies to cure this serious illness. That all lovers are blind and even Cupid wears a blindfold. And you will not have something for stubborn lovers, big heads, fools and stupid? Something will have to be found, madam, that every evil has its remedy. Well, come show me, there's a hurry. But... now? Now. That the ailment is serious and the patient does not wait. Brothers, see that they take me by force. It is clear that I do not go of my own free will. (laughs) But where are we going? Goes up. Now I'll tell you, bad guy. (Bells in background) �Qu� mir�is? Anything. I too am sorry to leave Rome. I'm not just sad to leave. Is there something else? S., don Sancho. I wonder if you are the same one who was so loving in Venice, and I wonder if the fire could have been put out of those days so beautiful. do not fear. Nothing has died. Toledo will cure us both. But isn't all this crazy? S�, Ramp�n. Madness to cut things at their time. I'm sick of this life of risks and worries. No, I will not go to Toledo. Although I have promised.
