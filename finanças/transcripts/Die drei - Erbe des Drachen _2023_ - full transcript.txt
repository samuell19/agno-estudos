Dear Rockies, fasten your seat belts, record-breaking temperatures are ahead. What a picture-perfect start to the summer holidays. Here's Two Door Cinema Club's summer hit: What You Know. This is DJ Wolf man for Radio Rocky Beach. Justus Jonas. You're finally here. That damn bird is driving me crazy. That constant squawking and talking. In a dead language, to boot. I can't even understand it. You and your bird are two of a kind. -Were you guys at least profitable? -Isn't this beautiful? Such a good deal. My idea to bring Justus paid off. -Yet another vase... -It's a Roman amphora, Aunt Mathilda. Not a vase. It was used to store wine or oil. Amphoras became an important measure for fluids in Ancient Rome. It really was a great deal. I'd say we earned your aunt's cherry pie. I hope it sells better than your other "deals." Mr. Pico just called looking to sell a valuable sword. - Told him you're on your way. -But Auntie... No ifs or buts. Earn your cherry pie now. You'll be in Romania all summer. With the dashing Steven Yates. Oh, "the dashing Steven Yates." Surely you'll be so good as to bring your aunt a little souvenir? Surely. Hi, it's Peter, I'm busy. You know the drill. On your marks... Hi Peter. I won't make it today, I'm stuck here. I'm really sorry. Come by the office tonight and... I'll make it up to you. I promise. Ms. Bennett! You scared me. Say, shouldn't you be home packing your bags for your trip? -Shit! -Before you go... Here's a little thank you for the most diligent assistant we've ever had. -That's way too expensive! -It's from the Lost and Found. Thank you! You're the best! Have a nice vacation and don't miss me too much. -You're late, Second Inspector. -Nice to see you too, Justus. I win my race and you say I'm too slow. So show us what you've got, speedy Pete. Race you down? Transylvania, here we come! Hurry up, First Inspector, Dracula's hot on your heels. It's too bright for him. THE THREE INVESTIGATORS LEGACY OF THE DRAGON Our first transatlantic flight. The Three Investigators go to Romania. As our trip to Transylvania starts tomorrow, we should be prepared for anything. It's an internship with my dad, Justus. There won't be any cases to solve. Like I said: be prepared for anything. I think it's time for an upgrade. There's no stopping digitization. -A box of matches? -Happy? -Seriously? -By the way, we got... Wait. ...a mention in the L.A. Post. Well, their local section. An entire page on our film. "Director Annabeth Parker reshooting an all-time classic." A classic with Steven Yates? -You're kidding. -Your dad is mentioned too, Peter. "Special effects for this Hollywood blockbuster will be provided by Rocky Beach resident Henry Shaw -and his company Wonderland." -We'll be a part of it! It's gonna be... Sounds like it's time to go. See you tomorrow, gentlemen. Next stop: The "Dracula Rises" set. -Justus? -I'm coming, Aunt Mathilda. Hello? Dad? Okay, the sword works fine. Can you hear me? -What's that knocking? -Wait. -I'll take a look. -Hank?? What was that? Everything okay? Are you okay? Hank, the connection is poor. Who is she? Why is she screaming? Everything okay? Vlad? Everything okay? Peter. Hank. Hank. Can you hear me? See you tomorrow. There you are. Listen, I wanted to come. I was just really... Busy. Yeah, got it. -What was that woman screaming about? -Are you in detective mode again? I worked hard to get you this internship. - I can count on you, right? -Yeah, Dad, you can. I really wanted to come. Tell me, how was it? It's fine, Dad. It was just a stupid race. I'll wait outside. So, guys. Are you excited for your first European adventure? It's gonna be... Hi, Annabeth. No, not yet. I'll take a look. Yes, of course. Gentlemen. You remember Hank, right? Dad's assistant. -He's already at Castle whatsit... -Piatra. Right. So, I overheard a conversation between him and my dad. A woman started screaming in panic. She was totally distraught. And then? And she kept screaming a strange word. -Something like Vlad. -Vlad Draculea? -Dracula? -Not Dracula. Vlad Draculea. He was a vaivode. -A vai-what? -A Romanian general. You still haven't read the script? The entire film is about him. He lived in 15th-century Transylvania. Though he only got famous in the 19th century. He was the main inspiration for... -Count Dracula. -See? Jump in! Man, oh, man. We'll miss our flight. Dracula is pure fiction, Second Inspector. A fantasy figure. Draculea means "son of a dragon.” He was infamous for brutality. There are loads of myths and legends based on Vlad. Vlad Draculea III fought for the Dragon's Order to spread Christendom. And he wasn't only brutal, but also extremely smart. He once disguised himself as an Ottoman and snuck into an opposing camp to gather intelligence. That night, his army attacked. It was a bloody battle with many casualties. According to legend, after winning the battle, he made a stop at Castle Piatra. There, he met the landlord's beautiful daughter and fell deeply in love. He swore loyalty to her and promised to return to her castle once victory was his. As legend has it he's stayed true to that promise. Kinda big, right? I feel like I've run a marathon. That's not surprising. Rocky Beach time is... 05:53 a.m. Normally, we'd still be fast asleep. I don't feel like sleeping, to be honest. Considering that Vlad is in the area. No need to panic. Even if he really was around back then, he'd have been buried more than 500 years ago. Or maybe not. No papier-mâché or green screen here. Just... -Hey! -Watch out! ...just a proper castle. -Wasn't that... -Steven Yates. Dear film crew... A cordial welcome to Castle Piatra, the home of the Kretzulesco family. The ravages of time unfortunately don't pass a castle like this by. But Mr. Repta, our caretaker is working on it... He's pale enough to pass as a vampire himself. You need not worry, though. You just shoot your film. I wish you a pleasant stay in our beautiful Transylvania. Now's as good a time as any. Mr. Yates, could I get an autograph? For my aunt. What's going on? Something is cursed. What is she saying? She says the family is cursed. So the drama has started before the shoot. Let's grab a drink. Gentlemen. She's the woman from the video call. -Damn, I told you. -Vampires don't exist. You're really sure it's the same woman? One hundred percent. With that haircut... Then we should talk to Hank tomorrow. You... You hear that too, right? Hear what? That melody. The latest hit from the Romanian charts. We're looking for our room. -That's some set! -Wow! -Calm down, we need to find Hank. -Aye, aye, sir! There he is. Then let's go. Morning, Hank. The Three Investigators reporting for duty. Hey, guys, slept well? Kinda. So you're finally here. And? -How do you like our centerpiece? -Wow, Dad. A cross. On film sets, there's always more than meets the eye. Look. -This pump creates... -A vacuum, which sucks fluid through the tubes to the top. The cross Vlad stabs. And blood flows out of it? Very good. Someone's read the script. And you three are our artificial blood experts. It's your job to find the right consistency, so that it drips down eerily. What do you think of our cross now? -There he is. -Let's ask him about the maid. Got the right consistency yet? Still figuring it out. -Is that a drone bat? -Bat-bot. Bat-bot? Sounds like a superhero. Annabeth wants a bat. It was going to be animated, -but I suggested building one. -It can really fly? -It will. Like a real bat. -Cool! How long have you been at the castle? A week. Have you noticed anything peculiar this past week? Vampires? Zombies? Screaming women? During a video call with Henry, the maid started screaming. -Just like that? -No. There was this knocking again, so she thought Vlad had returned and was banging. I knew it: vampire-zombies. So you've heard that knocking before? Yeah. -At night and always in the same place? -Yeah. In the west wing, the only place where, with a bit of luck, you might just get Internet. You do realize what this means? -It's haunted. -Haunted? I thought we had an agreement. Before you get into mischief, these need recharging. Afterwards, help Hank with the coffins. The term "haunted" has no scientific credibility. -Well, someone's knocking. -Yeah, but who? We'll keep watch tonight. Jesus, Peter, use the set electricity. The castle's is too weak to power a hair dryer. -Move a bit, won't you? -I can't. Guys, you're too loud. Surveillance means observing secretly and remaining undetected. Surveillance means seeing anything at all. For that, we need to look around the corner. -What are you doing? -Getting my camera, of course. Gentlemen. What's he doing? Quick, follow him. Retreat. It's... The vampire-zombie. Quick, upstairs. Come on. Guys, that was too close. I told you vampire-zombies exist. Nonsense. There must be a rational explanation. Then why did you run? Where are we? Looks like a kid's room. But whose? Maybe the Countess has a brother. Is he the Countess' brother? It would seem so. Looks like he was into science. "Disparut." Then it says how tall he is. He was thirteen. A missing person report. On May 20, 1958, Alexandru Kretzulesco disappeared. That's the source of the music. Not the latest hit. Gentlemen. Is she... We better go. Justus, come on. Wait a sec. If the Countess sees us, she'll have a heart attack. Are you insane? The vampire-zombie is out there. You're welcome to stay here. The coast is clear. Yes? Dad. We... Well, we... Peter? We... were in the Countess' room. The vampire was... You were where? The knocking Hank heard... It's knocking and vampires one day, a poltergeist island the next. I thought we said no detective games. Don't worry, Peter. Your dad will calm down. A missing boy... Inexplicable knocking... A maid claiming to have seen Vlad. A vampire-zombie. For which there'll be a rational explanation. In any case, something's up. Gentlemen, we have a case. Are you crazy? You heard my dad. I don't want more trouble because of your wild theories. We're here on an internship. Drone approaching! Sorry, guys! I haven't seen real bats fly like that. Your dad should pay us a risk bonus. This is life-threatening. There's a vampire-zombie and you're worried about a drone bat? Danger or not, we need to find out why Alexandru Kretzulesco disappeared. But how? We're in the middle of nowhere without Internet. Are you two at it again? -Where are you going? -Leaving the danger zone. -Watch out! Careful! -Dude! Oh, no. -Are you okay? -Yes, but... -Luciana lonescu? -You're acquainted? Not to my knowledge. You're the expert on Vlad in Transylvania. And our historical advisor. And you are? Justus Jonas, Peter Shaw, and Bob Andrews. -We're sorry, we wanted to... -Don't worry. Maybe broken glass is lucky? Give me half an hour and it'll be as good as new. How about ten minutes? I have an appointment in town. You're going to town? Thank you. Wonderful. LIBRARY "...13-year-old nobleman disappeared without a trace..." "Kidnapped by Vlad?" "The Brotherhood: 'Legacy of the Dragon. "Vlad's legendary treasure lost for centuries." "Founded by S. Kretzulesco and G. Popescu.” "Crypt"? What "crypt"? Excuse me, I'm looking for a map of Castle Piatra. M-a-p? Yes, a map! You're the expert on Vlad. Have you heard about his treasure? Or the Legacy of the Dragon? I happened to read it somewhere. The Legacy of the Dragon was a brotherhood. Modeled on the Dragon's Order that Vlad Draculea and his father fought for. The brotherhood was obsessed with Vlad. What about the treasure? There are many different stories about the treasure. The most common assumption is that it was a blood red ruby. Vlad supposedly wore it on his last crusades. Legend has it that it made him undefeatable. After Vlad's death, numerous people have ventured to find the ruby. So far, no one has been successful. Which means that the treasure really exists. There's no historical proof. And what do you believe? My grandfather told me about it when I was little. It's a good story, but that's it, if you ask me. So Kretzulesco founded the brotherhood, and his son Alexandru, the Countess' brother, was to take over one day as leader? Exactly. But during Alexandru's initiation ceremony, something tragic happened. -He disappeared without a trace. -The vampire-zombie! The Brotherhood's protocol deemed that new members at the age of... thirteen had to spend one night in the locked crypt. What crypt? The place where Vlad supposedly pledged loyalty to his beloved. But by dawn, Alexandru was gone without a trace. Rumor spread that Vlad had come for the boy. Maybe Vlad, possibly Repta. To prevent further visitations, Kretzulesco had the crypt walled up and the Brotherhood dissolved. And if I'm not mistaken, the former entrance is located... precisely... here. Between the west wing and that knocking in the hallway. A disappeared boy and knocking coming from a lost crypt... Clearly, Vlad is trying to escape the crypt to find a new victim. Who? Vlad or Repta? What if the aim isn't to escape, but to get into the crypt? But why? -To find Vlad's treasure. -That ruby? We'll have to find out. Gentlemen, we'll watch over the hallway tonight. Are you nuts? A boy disappeared here without a trace. Nobody disappears without a trace. As detectives, it's our duty to investigate. It's our duty to help my dad. That's why we're here. Gentlemen, this comes courtesy of Castle Piatra to mark tomorrow's shoot. Enjoy. How kind. Thanks a lot. Maybe Peter's right, Justus. Tomorrow we should be sharp. The hallway can wait. Help! Listen closely. The children of the night. The... The music they play. Damn it! Cut! From the top, please. These damn lines. -Steven, everything okay? -Yeah. I can't breathe because of the makeup. Know what? We'll take five, okay? Henry, could you turn up the smoke? It's a dream scene, after all. Out of the way, fatty. Someone got out on the wrong side of the coffin. At least he was on time. Where the hell have you been? You could've at least changed. My camera! Wait... Seriously? You went to the hallway on your own? You guys wanted to sleep. What are you doing? Life will punish those who come too late. If Mr. Shaw doesn't. We overslept. We didn't even hear the alarm clock. How did it go? I fell asleep, too. And only woke up minutes ago. It's as if someone wanted us to be fast asleep. But how? Well, what did we all consume yesterday? You mean Timeo put something in our tea? Sure, Timeo put sleeping pills in our tea before serving it to us personally. Very clever and inconspicuous. You're really onto something, Justus. Wrong, Second Inspector. This is what I'm onto. -Is that all? -Awesome camera work. Hank calling Peter. We need fresh blood. Coming. For the next scene, we need the flasks with the UV powder. Guys. I know where I've seen those boots. What a nasty vampire-zombie. He doesn't seem to mind daylight much. Okay, and who exactly are your suspects? What's he doing there? -Mandragora officinarum. -What? Commonly known as mandrake. A member of the nightshade family. Untreated, its roots are poisonous. But in the right dosage, it can be useful. Since medieval times, it's been used as an anesthetic. So Repta spiked our tea. He sedates the Countess so he can search for the crypt's entrance untroubled. It should be here. There's no door here. Thanks for the info. You gotta be kidding. Works better than I thought. Better than you thought? Have you lost it? You stole that from my dad? It's "borrowing," Second Inspector. Give the powder back. Gentlemen? Did you dust the entire hallway? -Just a small strip. -Well, it worked. Now we only need a lock pick. If only one of us knew how to use it. It's intuition, First Inspector. That was never your strong point. Sorry, Justus, but there's no crypt in here. Search everything. Nothing. Wait. If you wouldn't mind? Come on! A little more! Let's go. That explains the knocking. Vlad Draculea, the dragon. The entrance to the crypt. It's beautiful. I'd say it's terrifying. All together, boys. A closing mechanism. What the hell? Ingenious. A silent alarm. That's why the knocking stopped when we were in the corridor. -A motion detector. -Or an infrared laser. Hurry, someone's coming. Go, go! Stop! -Peter? What on earth? -Dad? -Did you see him? -See who? I lost him. Have you completely lost your minds? The tea is poisoned. I thought we'd discussed your detective games. -It's not a game, Dad. We've got clues... -Which lead us to believe that... Repta poisoned the Countess' tea so he could steal Vlad's treasure unimpeded. So this time it's the old janitor conspiring against the Countess? We found a whole bed of mandrake next to his hut. And we got him on tape. You got him on tape? -Well, not quite. -It's enough to identify him. -We hit upon a breakthrough... -An investigative breakthrough. Why else would he run from us? Dad. We're talking about the Countess' health. Thanks for your help. I'm sure there's a logical explanation. He says that the Countess has had insomnia since her brother disappeared. The only way she can sleep is with that tea. And his midnight walks? The Countess asked him to investigate the noises. The maid thought Vlad had returned and therefore quit. And where was he last night? Well, he's no spring chicken, and the crew has been keeping him busy with all the blackouts. Well, explain this! Get that out of Mr. Repta's face! Impossible. -He's after Vlad's treasure! -There is no treasure. I told you that. That's enough, right? I'm so sorry. I have no idea what got into them. It won't happen again. A child's imagination knows no limits. It'll wane as they grow. Kids! Kids who play detective and find conspiracies everywhere they go. You want to be taken seriously? Then take some responsibility. I thought I could trust you. You'll be doing the internship from now on. And don't dare bother the Countess with your fantasies. One more wrong move and you'll be on the next plane home. We must've missed something. -We need to go back to the crypt. -I've had enough! Enough of this dumb crypt. And you've got nerve to steal from my dad! You're the one who got us into this mess! Every detective knows not to make accusations without proof! We're doing an internship! But we're still the Three Investigators, Second Inspector. -We investigate anything! -We'll investigate nothing. I'm not the Second and we're not detectives. Dad's right: We're kids, not detectives! After negotiating long and hard, we've managed to acquire an original medallion from the famous Dragon's Order for the shoot. The medallion will be stored overnight in a safe on the east wing. It will also be guarded by security. We can use the medallion for the next three days. Let's make the most of it. Yes. Now I'll show you how to fly it. It's easy. Damn it all! What on earth! -So you're the vampire-zombie. -What am I? Why are you up at this hour? Why do you know my lines? I've involuntarily witnessed your rehearsal attempts before. Excuse me? When I was little, I had a role in a TV show. I could barely read, but I still had to learn tons of lines. So I found a trick. Great. But I need to get back to work, okay? Hey. What was the trick? Music. I sang my lines. There are also studies that show that chocolate improves your memory. Cut! Thanks, we've got it. Brilliant! Great work, Steven. Let's set up the last shot for today: a close-up of the medallion. Dismantle the rest of the set. Not too bad, huh? Fantastic, Steven. Really good! -I'm not in the next shot, right? -Exactly, take a break. Bob. What? Don't you recognize it? What do you mean? The medallion is the key. It fits perfectly into the gate's locking system. Brotherhood: The Legacy of the Dragon. It all makes sense. Are you sure? But that'd mean... Someone planned to bring the medallion to the castle. To get into the crypt. You want a written invitation, boys? The floor won't mop itself. Coming! Sorry, Justus. We're in enough trouble. He can't be serious. Peter. He's up to something again. Peter. Peter. That's what I call intuition... Easy as pie. Bob? -Justus! -Justus! Gentlemen, this is an emergency. I'm stuck in the tower. The medallion has been stolen. The perp is probably already in the crypt. Get me out of here, and hurry! Justus Jonas, the great detective has got himself into a trap and needs our help? This isn't the time for schadenfreude. We have to get Justus out of there. Yeah, and how? The tower is under surveillance 24/7. There are no windows and we can't walk through walls. Or maybe we can? Wow, a secret door! Look... here. But there's no other room. Peter. -What does this line show? -The perimeter wall. The tower is to our east. The entrance to the perimeter wall should be... there! That must be it. But there's nothing here. Apart from that shield. Justus, it's us. Justus. Justus. What the heck is that? You took your time. A simple "thanks" would suffice. You look awful. Were you in the fireplace? -How'd you find the secret door? -Who would've thought? The great detective Justus Jonas is in the dark. Maybe you'll watch the whole video next time. Sloppy detective work. It was easy to work out the route using the map. The rest was, if you ask me, first-class detective work. I taught you well. Not so fast, First Inspector. How about an apology? -We don't have the time. -Well, let's make time. We're the Three Investigators, not the First Inspector and his two minions. Here's my suggestion: I won't do any more solo missions, and you two stick to our motto: We investigate... Anything. Damn it! We're too late. Put down the spade. Put it down, Luciana. Boys. Good to see you. You... -You were right. Repta... -Don't even try it. As an expert on Vlad and Transylvania, you were perfectly prepared for such a crime. That's why she wanted to film at the castle. To get unrestricted access and look for the treasure. -And that deal with the museum... -Was brilliant. You knew about the secret door and suggested keeping the medallion in the tower. You don't understand. We do, actually. So, where is the treasure? You haven't found it. My grandfather... founded the Brotherhood with Kretzulesco. Georghe Popescu was your grandfather? He was so sure that the ruby was down here. So he forced Kretzulesco to dig for it. When Alexandru disappeared without a trace on the night of his initiation ritual, Kretzulesco blamed my grandfather. He believed it was Vlad's punishment for the desecration of the crypt. He kicked my grandfather out of the Brotherhood. Which meant your grandfather couldn't continue his search. So you did it for him. But I definitely wasn't chasing a woman. And we could hear knocking before she was at the castle. Well observed, gentlemen. Miss lonescu wasn't acting alone. Demolishing a wall that fast wouldn't have been possible alone. -So it was Repta? -Close, Second Inspector. It must've been someone who had access to the castle before the shoot, who could move around freely and sedate the Countess. Not bad. Luciana. I told you I need more time. Luciana. Don't you understand? There is no treasure! What do you know? I don't pay you to think! Freeze. Leave them alone. -They're just kids. -They should've thought of that earlier. They know too much. If we let them go, they'll go straight to the police. I won't leave them in here. I am not going back there. Not for them and not even for you. I'm sorry. That way, let's go. Sir, you can't lock us in here. I can do more than that. So don't try me. No! Help! Stop! Leave it open! No! Hello? Help! Open up! Hello? Open up! Hey, hello! -Can anyone hear us? -It's no use. At least we've got a clear confession. Not much use down here. Damn battery. Fantastic. We're finished. No doubt about it. Calm down. No one knows we're stuck here in this stupid crypt! Who'll find us here? There must be another way out. Right, Justus? Nobody can disappear without a trace. Nobody can disappear without a trace... He's lost his mind. His brain didn't get enough oxygen in the fireplace. That's it. What's it? What if Alexandru Kretzulesco didn't disappear? -What do you mean? -What if he wanted to disappear? Alexandru was to be initiated into a brotherhood of superstitious fanatics. But Alexandru was fascinated by science. -We know... -His father used to lock him in the crypt... And leaving via the main gate without the medallion was impossible. Let's recap: Vlad Draculea was a man with many enemies. To avoid putting his lover's life in danger, he had to enter the castle unseen. So there's another secret door? A secret passage out of the castle. Okay, but that would mean Alexandru knew about the passage and had a plan. I see columns, but no door. Secret passages, by definition, are hidden, Second Inspector. May I? They're as short as possible and lead through the defense wall to freedom, to a place concealed from the enemy. Because we're in the southwestern section of the castle, and the main entrance is in the north, the shortest route out of the castle would be here. If I wanted to get into the crypt unseen, I'd build an entrance here. Maybe there isn't a secret passage after all and Alexandru really was taken by Vlad. Nobody can disappear without a trace. Congratulations. This is how Alexandru must have felt. What do you say to that, First Inspector? Stop it. -I didn't do anything. -Let me. Give me a hand. Harder! -The secret passage. -Love always finds a way! This is the last one. Over there. There's only one way down. Maybe we should go back into the crypt and look for a... For another... On three. One, two, three! Come on, gentlemen. We've got a case to solve. -Dad. -Where have you been? Things are crazy here. The medallion was stolen. The Countess blames the crew and wants us gone. Why are you soaking wet? What's it this time? Nothing, Mr. Shaw... I don't want to hear it. This isn't a game. The police are searching the whole castle. The perp got away unnoticed. "Perps." -What? -"Perps," plural. Well... Look here, Dad... A secret passage? Sounds a lot like Alexandru. Our father was always strict. He raised us according to the rules of the Brotherhood. But Alexandru was an inquisitive inventor. For him, it must've been hell. I spent decades searching for him. But every clue led to a dead end. Over time, I lost all hope of ever seeing him again. Countess, your brother may still be alive. Well, but... But... Then why wouldn't he get in touch for all these years? It's... Come in. They got them. Luciana and her accomplice were caught at the Moldovan border. -And the medallion? -They had it. If not for these three, they'd be long gone. Great work, boys. I think I owe you an apology. Especially you, Peter. It's all right, Dad. Detectives don't hold grudges. Mr. Shaw, tell Miss Parker filming can be resumed. Thank you so much, Countess. Don't thank me. Thank these three young men. One moment. I need to know: Where is my brother? The sea is merely a container for all the weird and wonderful beings that live inside it. Its vitality knows no limits. Let's keep it that way. Move to slide 36... Can I help you, gentlemen? -The presentation isn't until tomorrow. -We think this belongs to you. How did you find me? Nobody can disappear without a trace. -And yet, I almost managed it. -A boy's room reveals a lot about him: the scientific equipment, the prizes, the books about oceans... And the little flags on the globe, pinned on coastal cities. So we looked for connections, but they weren't actually cities... They were marine biology institutes. But "Alexandru Kretzulesco" wasn't in any of the databases. And their ages didn't match. So we must've missed something. But the answer was right in front of us. So our search started anew, this time for the names of the characters in the book. We found lots of names. But one had no nationality. Xander Aronnax. Born: Alexandru Kretzulesco. It's been a while since anybody called me that. I wanted to run away from home when I was young. I just didn't fit in. I spent countless nights locked in that damn crypt. No child should be punished for its dreams. Your sister looked for you for years. Why didn't you get in touch with her? Not a day goes by that I don't ask myself that. -And what about the ruby? -But there is no treasure. We were in the crypt together. It's impossible to discover a treasure that was already found. I noticed something strange after moving the statue and finding the secret passage. Her hands were pointing to a column. I'd never noticed it. Where the treasure was. So you could finance your escape and new life. I couldn't buy my freedom with something I despised. Now I've got a question for you: Who are you, anyway? Three question marks? "The Three Investigators. "We investigate anything.''' First Inspector: Justus Jonas. Second Inspector: Peter Shaw. Records and Research: Bob Andrews. So... where's the treasure? Dear Rockies, DJ Wolf man is live tonight at the "Dracula Rises" premiere, starring Steven Yates. I'll meet Steven and costar Betty Rider on the red carpet... I'm coming! ...So tune in and join us for some fun. He can't be serious. Titus Andronicus Jonas! Why aren't you dressed? We need to leave! -You won't believe the deal I got. -You'll have me to deal with if you're not ready to go in five minutes. -But the premiere is tonight. -We want to have a nice day, too. -And Steven is giving... -I'm sure Steven didn't get you flowers. Five minutes. Where's that boy now? Justus! Justus Jonas! What are you doing here? We need to go. Let's go before your aunt pulls our heads off. Right. When Steven Yates is involved, it's no laughing matter. Justus Jonas of the The Three Investigators. Translated by: Louis Bazalgette Zanetti, Matthew Way
