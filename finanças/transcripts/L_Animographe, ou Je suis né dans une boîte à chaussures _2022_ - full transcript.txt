“BUT," HE ADDED, "NO PROPHET IS ACCEPTED IN HIS HOME TOWN." In the 1960's in France, a self-taught inventor presented himself at the ORTF Research Department with the bizarre idea of building a machine to draw cartoons. This machine was the animograph, and its inventor, Jean Dejoux. Together, they would travel around the world. From the Shadoks to Asterix, from Chuck Jones to Norman McLaren, from Paris to Hollywood, via Italy, here are the unknown and thrilling adventures of a visionary and his wondrous machine. The TV news introduced to you last Sunday an astonishing French invention talked about in all the papers, the cartoon-making machine, a truly revolutionary machine, the animograph. We wanted to know more about the machine itself and, above all, its inventor, Jean Dejoux. These little characters, which I've always drawn mechanically at my drawing table, have always made me dream. I wanted to see them move. So I first translated this dream into drawings, which, even inside the structure of the gag I was looking for, was found in their movement. Yes, it was very nice. It broke down into three or four drawings. Movement was essential. And then no, it really had to move. I had to unblock all my dimensions. In other words, it had to move, make some noise, talk and have some colour. I used to see my father standing at his table, drawing. He worked a lot for Paris Match and other big papers. He drew cartoons in which there is quite a lot of movement, it's true. But his dream was animation. I learnt animation image by image, following this terribly long process. Animation is essentially an extremely slow process. You do thousands of drawings. In theory, you do almost 700 to 800 drawings for one minute, so it was very logical to try to invent a machine that could help this laborious, artisan process. He thought that, with television, there was something, a joint, something to find and he found it. One day, Dad called René saying: "Listen, I think I've invented something. I'd like to show it to you, maybe I'm mad". And he showed it to René, who told him he wasn't mad, he had really invented something. So here is the forerunner of your animograph. Yes, exactly. Everything started like in all the best stories. The poor young man who arrives with a cardboard box, and in this cardboard box is a mass of wires. You switch them on and little characters start moving. Moreover, he told me during the last years of his life: "I would like to write something and it would be called 'I was born in a shoe box'. And so he arrived with his cardboard shoe box with a mass of films, prisms, a whole optical thing I couldn't explain. In this cabinet, you have the famous shoe box with which Jean Dejoux arrived at the ORTF Research Department to present his invention. Firstly, on the lid, there is a polarising filter which you can turn by hand. On the inside, there is a system of mirrors and also polarising filters combined with two images. In fact, the system allows either one of the images to be seen or both images superimposed, by simply progressively turning the polarising filter on the lid. And then, I started to get lucky because first of all, I had found a highly competent engineer, the engineer Kitroser, and the company that employed him. They began working on it right away. He used to tell me that this man looked and listened to Dad's explanation and told him: "Your thing's good, but it's a bit thrown together." Television was the ideal media for its format, for its means of broadcasting animation. At that time, I went surreptitiously to this company on the Rue Cognacq-Jay through any door I could. It was Jacqueline Joubert who had a programme called "Encounters with..." ENCOUNTERS WITH... He went to see her, explaining that he had his little machine, his little thing in cardboard with a little man inside it, and he needed one of the cameras to film it. And Dad told me that he would always remember a technician who said, during a silence: "Oh wow, it's moving!" So, it worked. The little man moved, and that was how it started: a little man in a shoe box. It was a primitive animograph. He showed it to Pierre Schaeffer, who found it pretty interesting. It was perfect timing, because the Research Department was very interested in animation and cartoons. He had some great artists like Laguionie, Kamler, Foldès, some great animation artists. That made Schaeffer happy, and when something made Schaeffer happy, you had to do it quickly. So the animograph, according to Dejoux's plans, was ordered from SFOM. And that's how the adventure started. The ORTF developed a special department which used to make programmes that you could perhaps see on Channel One or Channel Two, or on no channel at all if that was deemed preferable. So for us, the Research Department, it was something quite exceptional in the world. The fact that that could even exist was, in itself, incomprehensible within the structures of the time, and it doesn't exist any more. They called it the Research Department. The Research Department is... It's here. It's all this. We thought we were going to go to cold offices, very modern. Yet you work here in... extraordinary outdoor conditions. The Research Department begins by looking for researchers. Consequently, it means finding musicians, directors, painters, artists interested in modern problems of modern arts and art techniques. It also means finding scientists, electronics scientists, working with electronic acoustics and optics interested in the problems of art, the formatting problems of cinema, television and radio. Researchers is a term which is both very specific and very vague. We had to be highly multi-skilled because we did the whole production, the organisation, the management, training, shifting... It was all research. YOUR PROGRAMME WILL BE BACK SHORTLY... For three years, we developed this cardboard box's daughter. Its daughter is made of metal, and if you would like, we're now going to take a closer look at it. OK, let me introduce you to Caroline, the first born of the large family of animographs. Caroline. Why Caroline? Caroline was the name of Émile Reynaud's mother, who was the creator of animation and even maybe of cinema. So, with the greatest respect, we called it Caroline. Reynaud and Jean Dejoux should have met, even though Reynaud died in 1918. But both inventions, those of Renaud, in other words, the praxinoscope, the theatre praxinoscope and the optical theatre created in 1888, are similar objects invented 70 years apart. Yes, there's standard animation used in cinema, and there's this one. What is the difference? The essential difference is this. Here are 24 little drawings which represent exactly the amount of work needed for just one second of cinematic animation. In other words, 1,440 drawings, drawn, then filmed image by image, for one minute of animation. And now? And now, with the animograph which makes thorough use of retinal persistence, we only need 300 drawings for one minute. In other words, the rhythm is of five or six images per second. And you can evaluate the result? We can evaluate the result immediately, as we're going to do now. I can stop the animation. I can set it going again. I can accelerate it or slow it down, and I can make it go backwards and forwards. If I don't like one of the characters I've drawn very much, I can take it off. It falls down onto my pencil, and I can correct it immediately, and I can send it back to play its role in the machine. In fact, it's a very simple process. It's more complicated mechanically, which is why we have the imposing machine presented at the MIPE, the International Market for Television Programmes and Equipment. The first one took place in Lyon. The MIPE is a marvellous week because the Research Department trusted me three years ago. It was a real game of poker deciding to build this device. And now at the MIPE, under the banner of French Television, we were really delighted to see that almost all the representatives from all countries at the MIPE were interested in this device. Yes, in the newspapers. I think it was in 1963. It was everywhere. The incredible machine which revolutionised animation, and animators came from everywhere. Dad talked to me a lot about Norman McLaren. There was Bill Littlejohn, who became a very close friend. There was Chuck Jones, whom I met at home before he went to New York with Dad. Lots of people who said this machine was incredible. I knew Jean Dejoux, a very charismatic man, that's for sure. He was a charmer, but in a good way. He was enthusiastic about his research, his process. And he knew how to communicate, so well that he formed a close-knit team of people around him, people who believed... who believed in this marvellous machine. Uderzo made a visit, Goscinny made a visit to see the animograph. Unfortunately, they had not got to the stage where the first Asterix cartoon was made with the animograph. Because really, it was too early or too late, but anyway, it wasn't the right time. The animograph was viewed as something not frivolous, of course, but that the possibilities of it, because they were working on, used to working on a large format. And because you had to work on a small format, these old guys, maybe it was their eyesight, I don't know. But the... The first series was made on a machine called an animograph and which forced animators, in other words, the artists, to work on formats which were no bigger than that. They used to draw on 70 mm wide film, matt film, and consequently, it was a tiny little thing. Kodak used to make it for us, using the same perforators and the same celluloid media as for films. But they used what was called Kodatrace, and Kodatrace is a thing for artists and such. It's an unpolished media that you can draw on very easily. At the beginning, the Shadoks lay ordinary eggs, but as their legs were too long, the eggs used to break. Now, the Shadoks lay metal eggs. Norman McLaren animated directly on the 35 millimetre film, which is much smaller than that, so this format was not too small. In fact, they did a separate film that they made on 70 millimetre. Any machine takes exactly the same formula as Charles, Mr. Schultz films, so for me, it was no problem at all. Hello, Yogi. In particular, we know that Norman McLaren, the great Norman McLaren, author of a huge number of works, visited the RTF at the beginning of the 1960's to test the machine. Norman McLaren, who is Scottish, was born in Glasgow, has given animation a new economic sense. And I'm not joking when I say that, because he is well-known all the world over for having made camera-free films accompanied by instrument-free music. Norman McLaren discovered that he could quite simply draw directly onto the film and engrave with a tip animated cartoons which invented totally unknown forms. And as McLaren was a thorough, articulate man, he produced a full report describing the machine, and offering some ways forward for possibly using the machine in Canada. In this report, Norman McLaren, like a visionary, described what could be a problem in the future. Traditional animators were not ready to use this new animation process. Retroactively, we can remember that the animograph was a machine which... wasn't unanimously welcomed. It was too early. It completely dismantled the mechanics of traditional animation, and the "animators" of animated film, were confronted with a new element which could completely call into question the traditional system and traditional methods of animation. There were detractors. I was open to experiment in animation in the spirit of Norman McLaren. I found the machine a little funny. It was big and looked like it was put together by Meccano, and it was noisy. Yeah, but it worked. Well, a washing machine is quite silent compared with the noise the animograph made. There was one experiment made with the TV news, which consisted of me going to Cognacq-Jay early in the morning. The journalists used to give me... not each time, but used to tell me there's this or that subject, it would be good if we had a little graphic, a little drawing, something to explain the story. On 25 July 1956, the Andréa Doria, one of the most beautiful vessels in the Italian fleet, would never arrive in New York. Off the coast of the United States, the Stockholm, a Swedish boat, collided with her. So, I went with the subject. René Borg went to work, and we delivered the little 16 mm film, in black and white, of course. I took it to Cognacq-Jay, the film was developed, and went out that night on the TV news. Only the animograph could have done that, supplied an animation so quickly, but obviously, it was extremely simple. Ordering a sketch or a sequence in the morning and having it in the evening seemed absolutely impossible. Except that in the new world of television, there was no choice: if we wanted animation, we had to have something like the animograph. And it's exclusive to RTF? I hope it will remain so as long as possible. In spite of its promising beginnings, the Research Department never ordered any machine. The animograph remained a prototype. The end of Jean Dejoux's contract was approaching, and it was not renewed. It's true there were Dejoux contracts that were very advantageous for him, it's true. But I knew that he had been "dismissed" because René Borg had told me. René told me, and when he told me: "Your Dad forgave them, but I didn't. Moreover, I'm going to write a book", but the poor man died. I've read articles and things which said that Dad had been scorned, that it was absolutely disgusting. But the machine was kept, and several short films and mini series have been made on the animograph. KNIGHT OF THE HURRICANE S.O.S THE ZLOPS ARE ATTACKING! That morning was a charming morning like all the others. And in all the cities on earth, you could hear the soft, daily murmuring of our smiling, peaceful civilisation. Well, I have some memories, when we were sitting at the table and he was talking to Mum and I wasn't all that old. And there was this word, "polytechnician, polytechnician, polytechnician, polytechnician"... And now I understand. They really looked down on him because he didn't have any qualifications. When they used to say: "My dear Dejoux, there's no future in video", and so on... and: "We'll take your patents, we'll try to pinch your patents because you're not an engineer." Those are hard things. They knock you right down. So it took him strength and it took people coming to him saying that it was wonderful for him to fight. FRANCE ITALY In 1966, Jean Dejoux left for Milan to join Gamma Film, a company specialising in animation for the cinema and television led by Roberto Gavioli, with the view to developing a new animograph. Roberto Gavioli managed to convince Jean Dejoux to move to Milan to set up a secret laboratory within Gamma Film which hardly anyone knew about. They worked together for several years making a prototype of the animograph, a really extraordinary experience. Italian TV broadcast its first adverts via the programme Carosello, where the principle was to offer a normal story. But at the end, they broadcast an advert. Famous characters like Calimero and Alinea were born from this famous programme, Carosello. Carosello was a cult programme for generations of Italians during the 60's and 70's. These animations were made by many great Italian directors, Sergio Leone, De Sica and others. I'm going to read you an interview with René Borg, OK? "Fortunately, Jean had an exclusive contract to use the animograph after the ORTF, if they weren't using it. So between 1964 and 1967, he and I made a series of a hundred advertisements, each two and a half minutes long, in full animation named Gomma and Matitino: 'The fat rubber and the little pencil', broadcast by the RAI channel in Italy, all thanks to the animograph which officially, didn't work. There's no need to point out that no one at the ORTF knew that I was doing it." It was here that the animograph showed its full potential and was able to guarantee a quality image, while reducing costs. In reality, the final prototype made at Gamma Film was quite a cumbersome machine, and it didn't reach the goal of decentralising production for people to work at home. But the machine worked! During this time, another researcher knocked at the Research Department's door with a new idea of animation. He didn't know it yet, but his project was going to revolutionise television and shake the French society of that time. His name was Jacques Rouxel, and his project was called The Shadoks. The first person I met at the ORTF Research Department told me, seeing my really simple drawing: "That's just right! We've got a machine that's absolutely right for this kind of cartoon." The Shadoks looked like birds. They had a beak and feet, but their wings were ridiculously small. The Shadoks were really nasty. I don't know how much the relationship between the machine, Dejoux and Rouxel led the drawing of the Gibis and the Shadoks, but you can easily see that the artwork is a succinct artwork, and that it was important for Rouxel not to make people think of Walt Disney. That was something different. It's true that I don't want very much. I just want an illustrated text. The simplest possible drawings, the simplest possible characters to tell my story. The whole Shadok population pumped and pumped and pumped. They pumped for joy, they pumped with gladness, but for the moment for nothing, because the Cosmogol was showing up late. Following a change of director at the ORTF, a full series of 52 episodes of the Shadoks was ordered. It was produced using the animograph, and René Borg directed it. From Milan, Jean Dejoux asked his loyal friend to do everything in order to make it work, and to prove to everyone the efficiency of the animograph. At the beginning, it was extraordinary. It was a revolutionary machine: "It works! Let's do it!" and afterwards: "No, the prototype's going to break down. It's not reliable. The deadline's won't be kept." And then after: "Ah yes, we must do it." So... It's a bit difficult to follow, and completely contradictory. René Borg, you directed the Shadoks, these 52 programmes. How was this cartoon made? With a special machine called an animograph, which allows you to go more quickly than with classic animation. Yes? Because the animograph only needs eight drawings for one second's screening. The animograph is a device which allows you to make a chain of blended images one upon the other. It's a very complicated machine. Why make things simple when you can make them complicated? René Borg was a friend, and we often shared meals during the 1990's. The animograph was really something quite distant, and he used to talk about it as being a time of completely insane freedom. The first Shadoks were born just before May '68, a time of trouble and absolute chaos. So, everyone was doing what they wanted, when they wanted, and especially in the Research Department. He described it as a lively time, as a unique moment which he never experienced again in his life. So obviously, he used to tell me about all the people around Rouxel, about him, all those inventors, Goscinny, Uderzo, who used to come and who used to watch this machine, which was an unbelievable miracle. Everyone said that with that, they were going to change the face of animation and they were telling themselves: "Yes, we're at the time when there's a change of direction." And then fate decided differently, but that's a bit of a mystery. And our story could stop there. As with all the great stories, we could finish by saying that they lived happily ever after, but... that would be stretching your belief a little too far. Because, to be honest, it was just at the time when our series was going to stop that the real troubles were starting, for everyone. René explained to me that it went a long, long way, that they plagiarised the animograph and in the end, it hadn't worked. Dejoux went mad when he found out. There was a research engineer who was a very good chap, highly intelligent and very creative, who had found a sort of animograph, but... whose layout was a big different. Right. It was more certain and different, it used long, slightly wider films. Well, Dejoux didn't like that at all. It looked like the ORTF was entering into competition with him. You have to understand that there was certainly only one animograph in the history of making the Shadoks. And, jokingly, I would say that the Shadoks were not gentle, because they destroyed the animograph. They decided that the machine was broken. In fact, it wasn't really broken. It could have been repaired and it was still working a little. It was working. Which of the two were right? When you want to get rid of your dog, you say it's ill. They criticised Dejoux for his machine not being reliable, but they refused to buy him a reliable, industrial machine from which to produce animation. That was something which disgusted everyone. That was all. So these Shadoks, have they really changed since the beginning? Because they were born when? In '68, Jacques Rouxel? Actually on 1 May 1968, it stopped. And at the end of one week, the viewers were protesting. After one week, it had started going mad. You see, some time ago, the Research Department presented you with a programme, and this programme was the Shadoks. France was immediately divided in two. It was like another Dreyfus case. People sent letters and said that the Shadoks was a dreadful programme: the drawings were bad, the writers were illiterate. Obviously, half of these letters were for and the other half were against. In the end, the animograph had done its job. In other words, to make a full series of 52 three-minute long episodes. However, the machine was not reinstated by the ORTF. And then there was also... I don't know if it's anecdotal, but they must have come up against a finance expert in the larger company who said: "Listen, how much is the machine? 50,000 francs? OK, 50,000 francs. You've filmed an hour with it, so we're going to invoice it at 50,000 francs per hour." Which is obviously totally absurd, but that's not surprising for a financial expert. Besides, it was easy to lay an egg, you just had to count to four. I took a lot of precautions with Pierre Schaeffer. In other words, I used to go and see him to define a piece of research. I recorded everything he said to me, I wrote everything down, I wrote a report and I had him sign the report. And when I got to the result, it was always wrong. Well, with my Alsatian nature, I didn't get along very well with that. I found that the result matched what had been requested etc., and as soon as the result matched the request, it was no longer interesting. There was no more research. So I needed some time before I understood that precisely what was interesting was research, and when there was no research, there was no point continuing. I had to do something else. One of the basic principles of Shadok logic was that only by continually trying did you end up succeeding. Or in other words, the more it goes wrong, the more opportunities there are to be right. The decision to permanently stop using it for the Shadoks series was made by the production management. And you have to say it was a perfect success from a break-up point of view. And so this machine was dismantled, and several elements were stored at ESSART. I wanted to take some parts, but I was told: "No, we've found someone, a school." So I said: "That's great if a school's interested. I'm very happy!" But I never heard anything about it afterwards. I went there. I even took René Borg to ESSART. We couldn't find any trace of it, of the animograph. Like lots of machines, like the universal phonogene, I was ashamed to learn... It had spent some time at the Maison de la Radio's museum, and then they sold it, because there was a lot of aluminium in it. And for the scrap merchant who bought it, there was a weight of 200 kilos, for a couple of pence. They sold it and it was cut to pieces. There are many people who worked in public services and who took things from the archives home to save them. Because, then, there were no regulations, and that was quite difficult. In this case, I don't know what happened, but I found that quite scandalous to have thrown this machine away, which could very easily have gone to a museum of cinema. In spite of the contrary view of its director, Roberto Gavioli, Gamma Film decided to stop investing financially in the animograph. But Roberto Gavioli and Jean Dejoux didn't believe they were defeated. They decided to offer the machine to Technicolor in Los Angeles. The new animograph went to America in 1969. I have some photos of René Borg and my Dad in America opening some enormous crates containing six tonnes of equipment. So, Jean Dejoux went to the USA. He had just signed a contract with Nicolas Rézini, boss of Cinerama, who invited him to work with him in Hollywood. The machine went to America, and I found it some years later. But at that time, it was set up in some huge studios in Hollywood, with a computer and even more to get at than here. All the visionaries were interested in the animograph. Norman McLaren couldn't help being interested in the animograph, Chuck Jones couldn't help being interested in the animograph, out of curiosity. It was also the opportunity to do something different. And for those people, difference kept them alive. It was a trio of legendary animators who opened the doors of Hollywood to Jean Dejoux. Bill Littlejohn, Chuck Jones and Jules Engel had come to to France to test the animograph in the ORTF Research Department, and had understood the invention's importance. Chuck Jones was one of the great classics in the history of cinema animation, because he learnt his craft in the American studios. He worked with Leo Schlesinger in the Warner studios, one of the biggest animators, and he was often introduced as having been one of the inventors of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig etc. But he was also a genius artist, an extraordinary comedian, a very elegant man with a little bow tie. He was absolutely marvellous. He is one of the true pioneers of animation. Part of the team that gave us Looney Tunes. He worked on Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Elmer, the Roadrunner, Wile Coyote, Pepe Le Pew. It sounds like the guest list at Snoop Doggy Dogg, I know. Chuck Jones. When I met him again in Los Angeles, actually, it was at the end of 1970. And he had built a new machine, which was red, you know? Technically, it functioned the same way, but it looked like a piece of modern furniture, and it was quiet. And it was altogether much improved from the original we'd seen in Paris. SPEEDY THE HORSE Everybody came to look at Jean's machine. Everybody in animation. They were the greatest and the most visionary minds who understood that it was really great, who liked my father and appreciated him, so I say thanks and hats off to them. Terrific! Because Jean had a good reputation, you know. He was famous. He was a very famous animator. You know. It's like a club. It's like... They're like all... The animators speak a language of their own. I met Jean when I was a student at CalArts, and he had come to lecture. And at that time, Jules Engel was head of the experimental animation department. CalArts is a prestigious art school founded by Walt Disney in 1971. Strangely, Disney always had an eye on the future, and he told himself: "The artists of tomorrow must be trained at Disney". And for the first stage, he set up this workshop, this training university, this training school for animators called CalArts, which still exists today. But strangely, CalArts has almost freed itself from the creature that is Disney. And the CalArts students were told: "Try to invent something that would be your ideal animation." The animograph was very influential. But during that time, it was just the beginning of, well, not even the beginning. It was before the beginning of people's idea of computer animation, and the beautiful thing about the animograph was... how it would... It was so fluid to work on. When the idea of the animograph appeared, what was quickly needed was almost what we ask of computers today: to work very quickly, to be able to preview something, to be able to correct it and potentially even to be able to work at home. Some sort of telecommuting, since an animograph can be taken to your home and you can have 25 animators at home working on their little sequence all alone. And it's almost an invention that's been thrown together, but which is visionary, which renders what computer animation is today almost tangible. So, it was the United States which fully gave Jean Dejoux and his incredible machine an opportunity. Jean worked continuously on projects for American television for 15 years. We realise that, in fact, the animograph responded to some criteria, but not to all of them. It allowed you to do animation, but not all animation. It allowed you to make the Shadoks, but today, it wouldn't allow you to make Frozen. That's how it is, in fact: every tool has its great strengths and, necessarily, its great weaknesses. The animograph did launch the career of one young artist. In 1971, Gerald Scarfe was sent to Los Angeles to try out the machine, and what followed is a rock legend. They told me there was this new system in Los Angeles, the Dejoux system, and they seemed very enthusiastic about it and said that they would pay for me to fly to Los Angeles and to make some animation for the BBC on it. In animation, there is... If you want to make a movement like that, the master animator would draw that, and then he will draw that. And then you had other people who were called inbetweeners who would do all the drawings in between. And then when you ran all the drawings together, the arm moved. Well, I actually found when I got there, that that wasn't exactly true, and that the... Between the master drawing there and the master drawing there, this in between was a mix, a dissolve, you know, the two images blended together. And so at first, when I was working on it, I was disappointed. I thought, this is not what I'm expecting, but I thought, well, I'm in Los Angeles, you know, I mean America. I might as well try and do something. I was actually drawing onto this 70 mm film with a grease pencil, flipping it over and putting the colours on the back like that, so it's very immediate. It's very raw. It has a kind of energy that a lot of films don't have because they... they get... they go through so many sequences that their energy is dissipated, really. So this is the actual film I worked on. As you can see, it's about two inches by three inches, and I drew every image. And you can see how long it is. This is the drawings that I made. And this is an image of a Playboy girl, Playboy magazine in America. That's Long Drawn Out Trip. In Long Drawn Out Trip, I did every drawing and hundreds of drawings and it was a trip. And in those days, a trip was what you did on drugs. It was a very drug-conscious era. Not that I was on drugs. Some people think I was when I was drawing it. The only drugs I'm on are for my asthma. I just became addicted and fascinated by the film and the possibilities of film. And I even tried, you know, just splashing colour on. Impressionistic, I guess, is the word because I've always felt about animation that it's a medium that hasn't been fully explored. When Long Drawn Out Trip was shown on BBC Two, two members of the Pink Floyd rock group happened to be watching that night. "We've got to work with this guy. He's f***ing mad." That was my introduction, really, to the Pink Floyd. You know, it took a long time in the United States, for instance, to have animation that didn't look like Disney animation. When people thought animation, the first thing that would come out their mouth: "Oh, like Disney?" We went to Filmacion. We went to all the animator's animation companies in town. And, they said: "It's interesting, but you can't do this, you can't do that. This is the way we do it here. Good luck." And that was the way it worked. Their minds were always on the full animation table. That was the only way they could think. In my opinion, the studios didn't like this machine for one simple reason, that they had their process which allowed them to get into a slightly bigger degree of detail. You have to remember that with the animograph, you were drawing on a really small surface and that allowed them control, that allowed them to have chains of keyframes, that allowed them to recycle backgrounds. The existing system was quite satisfactory. The problem too, was that the animograph brought freedom, and the studios didn't want freedom. They wanted productivity, efficiency and above all, they wanted to be able to reproduce the same exact thing several times. There's one thing that amuses me. They said:"OK. We can't do Disney on it." Which is actually wrong because Dad always told me that you could do Disney-style animation, in other words, fluid. Having said that, you can't put 40 characters in the image, given the size of the Kodachrome. But in any case, Dad worked with Disney and that's funny. And there's one thing that Dad loved, and that was being a teacher, teaching animation at UCLA. He loved his students, loved teaching. He told me a lot about it. It was a great love in his life. He even won an Emmy Award in 1977 for the version of Peter Pan with Mia Farrow. They would do photographs of every single picture of the video image, of the live action image, and then draw behind that or over it the shadow. And then they would do a composite of the two images. And Jean was really good with all that, you know, he really understood the technical aspect of the film-making. Computer animation came along. That killed the animograph.

HE LEFT PART OF HIS ARCHIVES TO THE NICÉPHORE NIÉPCE MUSEUM IN CHALON-SUR-SAÔNE. GENIUS IDEA! HE DIED ON 17 JANUARY 2015. HIS ASHES WERE SCATTERED ON THE BEACH IN MALIBU, CALIFORNIA. BAD IDEA THE REST OF HIS ARCHIVES, INCLUDING THE FAMOUS SHOE BOX, WAS DONATED BY CHRISTINE DEJOUX TO THE MUSEUM OF ANIMATION IN ANNECY. THE END TO DATE, NO ANIMOGRAPH HAS BEEN FOUND.
