All right, that's enough for today. You guys remember to be on time on Sunday, okay? (children shouting) That's okay... (laughing) Bye bye. Hey. Hey. Someone die? Oh, no. Um, Abbie, I have to make a trip. Where to? Up north, just some business. Well, is everything all right? Yeah, everything's fine. I shouldn't be more than a week or so. (locomotive whistle blaring) That's my train. I love you. I'm worried about your father. All he said was that he'd be gone a week. Maybe he's gone to see a doctor or something. Pa? He's as healthy as an ox. Well, he gets short of breath sometimes, you know. It's just so unlike him to have secrets. I hope he hasn't gone looking for a high risk loan someplace. Well, if he needed a loan, he would come and see you, wouldn't he? You are the manager, after all. He's too proud. And with this drought, he's got to go someplace. You think that's what he's doing? Knowing Pa. (whispering) Abbie... Where have you been? I got something for you. Go on. (gasps) My pearls. Mm-hmm. The widow passed on, but her daughter's still alive. I had to tell her my whole sad story and promise her the Earth before she'd think of parting with 'em, but... here they are, good as ever. Will, you shouldn't have done this. I saw the look in your eyes when Isabelle announced her engagement. It cut me to the heart. And you thought it was because of the pearls. Hmm... don't try and spare me. I had to set things straight. How did you pay for them? It don't matter how I paid for them. If she wasn't gonna sell them to me, I would have stolen 'em back from her. The point is, they're yours. I just had to get 'em back to you. Just had to. Thank you. I don't care what happens to us. No matter how bad it gets, these pearls will always stay in the family. You're gonna be able to pass 'em on to your grandchildren. I promise you that. (Abbie) Isabelle decided to stay in New York for a while and work as an accompanist to pay for her trip. I took it as a sign that she'd made her decision. At home, a drought had settled in and suddenly seemed to threaten everything we had and everything we were. There's nothing left to sell. There's nothing left to beg, borrow or-- there's just nothing left. We can go on eating off this land, but we can't make no more payments. You have to talk to John. I could have saved this farm if I had him by my side, and I'll be darned if I'm gonna go to him for money! John is not the reason we're gonna lose this farm. (horse neighing) (sighs) We have to sell the pearls. No, Abbie. It's the only thing that makes sense. No. It's not the only thing. Pa, I was up most of last night going over your papers. Mm-hmm? Looked over everything there is to look over. Frankly, there just isn't anything that hasn't already been collateralized. Shoot straight with me, son. What are you saying? What I'm saying is... what I'm saying is what I had to say to Martin Sanderson, to Albert Toussaint, to Vince Cossini. Which is what? The bank can't stay in business making unsecured loans. If I don't bring in a harvest next summer, Gus Reinmuller sure as hell ain't gonna bring in one either. He has other assets. His other assets are his sons. Pa! (door opens) There's nothing I can do. (door closes) (horse whinnying) (horse grunting) I failed you. I'm so sorry I'm late. Oh, my goodness, look at you! (sighs) I can almost smell New York on you. Well? Were you accepted? (laughing) Would you consider letting me sign a separate note, guaranteeing the loan? On your salary? I can't let my father lose his land. God forbid if he should, and you are ruined by it as well, your sacrifice will only make bad blood. I'm not asking for any special favors. I'll repay with interest just like your regular customers. I won't let him lose it. (Isabelle) The Met, the Philharmonic, the theatres-- there are tickets for everything if you're a conservatory student, if you're willing to stand. (Abbie) What was it like? The Met? There were a couple of voices as good as yours, none better. I hope you'll go and see for yourself one day. I will... often, when I go to visit you in Manhattan. Mother, I'm not going to the conservatory. I'm staying here. I'm going to marry Erland. Isabelle, what are you talking about? The doors have opened to your brilliant future. I don't want to be a pianist, Mother. It doesn't matter what Erland wants for you. It's what you want that matters. I'm trying to tell you what I want! Your mind was made up before you ever went. Wasn't it? Then why? Because I knew I'd never hear the end of it if I didn't go. Well, I've gone. And I haven't changed my mind. I want to be Erland's wife, with a family of our own, on land of our own. All these years of preparing. Why didn't you just tell me? I thought my dream would be too small for you, that you needed to me to make up for your dream. Is it such a terrible thing, Mother? To be a farmer's wife? (sighs) Rain, damn you! I'm not gonna leave this land! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Pa! Pa! Pa! What is it, son? I did it! (chuckles) I got the-- I got the loan! I did it. Yeah. Yeah. God bless you, son. God bless you. I'm gonna go tell your Ma. Or do you want to do it? No, you should do it. Besides, I gotta get back to the bank. (horse whinnying) (gasping) Will! Will! Will!

(whimpers, sniffles) We didn't say much. Hardly anything, really. I told him I could get the loan. He hugged me. I could see his face clearly riding toward me. And he never looked happier. Money couldn't make him that happy, John. Only you could. He loved you with all his heart. Would you mind going in and seeing that the food is all laid out for folks? I'm so sorry. Thank you, Erland. Do you think he suffered? I think he was just taken. I don't think he suffered at all. The way it was between your father and John... is that the way it was between us? Yes. The way it is? No. Not anymore. It's hard to let it go. Mackenzie women are so stubborn. I'm sorry. I wasn't referring to you. These are for you. I thought today should be the day. They're not mine to give you anymore. They're your father's. He bought them back for you. I wish Daddy could see these on me. I have no doubt that he can. Ma, folks are waiting inside to pay their respects. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna come back here and work the farm. You're gonna stay right where you are. You're a banker, not a farmer. What are you gonna do? Bring in a harvest, God willing. I buried my husband on this land, and I want to lay beside him some day... after I've seen my grandchildren grow up. But until then, when my children need a shelter from the storm on some dark night, you'll find me just where I was always was. On the porch of our home, with a lantern in my hand.
