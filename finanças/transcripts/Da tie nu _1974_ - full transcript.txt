another robbery there's been a lot of robberies around here recently hey not a bad business huh [Music] there's no capital involved and easier money than working as a blacksmith wouldn't you say you know what you look kind of familiar to me i'm sure i know you where'd you come from oh right you make something and i unbox but still i want a strong one to hold a real tough fella yeah like an ox like you i won't [Music] you can tour and why not wasted time you couldn't catch a kid let alone a grown man better save your dough hey save your breath [Music] hold it where are you going where are you a traveler i just thought i'd go up and see those guys who were killed is that all right you like corpses my young lady you're pretty rude and why should i be polite i warn you we don't want any

business and if i don't care to do that now young man i warn you don't try to throw your weight around here do you own this place then mr wong is the leader of king village oh mr wong so that's who you are well then i will make trouble hold it sounds to me you know who the bandits are your own people listen ignore him i think that he's abandoned himself that's so is it written on my face you full teacher oh you're an instructor well let me instruct you the most unlikely people turn out to be bandits you never would guess mr yang if you know something tell us we've simply got to catch these men do you recognize that thing what is it what's it for [Music] that's just what he is hey dumbox what do you think can i pick up this one-handed i guess so oh mr liu i don't think you can can you do you really think that you can here stomachs all right damn it good that's good dumbass you had it all planned hey now come on you just couldn't do it not strong enough it's that simple so what he's an animal miss joy [Laughter] huh why are you still here miss troy who's that he's just some nosy stranger oh listen wouldn't you like to find out find out just who the killers are oh you mean you know who the bandits are maybe not not for sure but still i have a good idea though well tell us what's that got to do with it seen it before huh yes of course seen it often before but where though of course down at the blacksmith's place and this thing's the murder weapon so he was the dumbox i don't believe it we've got the evidence let's go get him hey i warn you you cut that out making trouble here for innocent men i think you look more like a murderer yourself well maybe so but you're wrong though but you're far too young to know very much [Laughter] [Music] i've done my time i've paid my debt won't they ever forget it just because i went wrong once will they always believe that i'm still a crook miss charlie let's go get him now sister mr learn was saying they've got the proof it must be deluxe there isn't any definite evidence you go home i'm going down there listen don't do anything yet not till there's proof anyway he's a real tough guy you couldn't handle him ever you wouldn't have any chance with him you goddamn you listen hey don't fight hi sam let's go [Music] hey hi son i'll go get low we can probably use him what for don't be ridiculous he's just a dumbass and i can handle him by myself all right well you go get him then and kill him hm right [Music] he came here two years ago he looked like an honest man to me so i gave him permission to settle down here how could i have known of this now look you mustn't blame yourself you can never tell by looks we're lucky mr yang spotted him there's other things too you don't know he was in jail some years ago i think that the only reason he came up here was to avoid recognition oh how come you know all this then because it's my business i'm a bounty hunter you see what's more i'm a damn good one too all right [Applause] why don't you get him master what's wrong listen your son's just gonna have to try and get the dumb ox wouldn't listen so i thought i better tell you no good what's wrong he can't handle him it's a pity he'll be on the alert now i'll go hey listen we'll make sure he doesn't escape we'll seal the roads [Music] look at him listen what is this hey [Applause] [Applause] you blended lousy murderer now look you come and accuse me give me no chance to talk i should touch your mouth we should never let you stay here get him uh faster oh huh you're really a tough one i'll be expecting a big reward for you you're making a mistake do you think i don't know about you your background i serve my time that's it nothing else but still you were crooked weren't you huh um i was stupid nothing else come on you came up here to carry on like before disguised as a blacksmith well go on admit it now do you recognize this thing [Music] so it was him him blaming someone else but with your record why should i believe you yeah that's right i've got a record huh and so i can never be trusted guess you're right all that i deserve well do whatever you want to i won't blame you hold it who do you suspect well tell me [Music] oh my god get this lot listen let's have no tricks or i'll kill you now look give me a share and then i can get through damn you lecherous bum if you could think more about your job instead of women you wouldn't bungle this and leave evidence behind but it was good they think it was the blacksmith now yang isn't a fool he knows his business he's an expert pretty soon he'll be on to us i think we should get all the money together and go hey listen what now don't want to leave the girls is that what it is oh no nothing like that i was thinking of what the boss will say you know what sort of temper the boss has got [Music] that fella yang is convinced the democs is the guilty one maybe so but the sooner we leave the better don't you think anyway wong still trusts us and for us that's important it gives us time if things go wrong then we can kill yang as well claim they were partners let's go right we'll do that [Music] hmm come on here give me a kiss don't be so cheeky come on in here i can't no time i'm going off for a little while for two or three days just drop past to say goodbye hey one kiss go on don't be so silly people will see you imagine what they'll say about you right see you oh and what brings you along here then you said you had the best accommodation in the whole village and that's very true too hmm but still it's rather expensive though hey tell me dumb ox what do you think of him you mean you think i've been to bed with him well he's tough but still don't think he's a crook and what about lang when it comes to bed all the men are the same also that's it he's a customer too is that right he's got dough that's all that's all i want hey how long have they been here he and his partner they came together some time ago oh but lo he's a real creep well what was their job before they came here you're nosy why all these questions what are you trying to find out i think i think you could help me i've asked everyone but no one knows anything in fact you're the only one who knows liam i mean he must have talked to you huh all right he told me once he'd always been a drifter um and he said he'd move soon wouldn't stay long he just wanted to get some money when he had then he'd take me with him as a teacher he wouldn't get paid much woody um don't know still he's real generous to me hey why do you want to know this one last thing do you know this learn's got one too just who are you never mind let's just forget it keep this it's for you i'm going hey hmm and so then you're quite lucky don't you think hey come back soon [Music] uh listen i knew you'd do it try and steal the money listen i i just needed some dough the traveling expenses hmm you're going to screw this whole thing up you stupid idiot listen get going go tell the chief we need him here sure [Music] saw pulling out [Music] i nearly blamed the wrong man you're going to be sorry you didn't [Music] [ __ ] [Music] ah oh [Music] what do we do now make use of the body huh far as long as concerned yang believed dumbox was abandoned so then it looked like they had a fight well then you are a fool it's damned obvious what we do is take the body i'd leave it near the village and then we tell mr wong that dumbox killed him after that there'll be no more doubt they'll know he's the bandit and in that case with one stone it's all very tidy [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Applause] [Applause] three [Music] my [Music] so [Music] what's wrong and the ox is digging a grave i saw him a grave that's right for burying yang he's
