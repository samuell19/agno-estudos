Do you recognize me? But is this real? I didn't think I'd see you again. It isn't a dream. I thought Death had come for me. Silly! You haven't changed. Vincent? - Great! - End of walk-through. We'll do it like that. - How did you like it? - It's fine. The camera's OK. - I'll do it again for you. - Go on. It's... "Is this real?" "I didn't think I'd see you again." "It's not a dream." "I thought Death had come for me." "Silly! You haven't changed." - Is that OK? - Yes. - I have a problem... - I'll be right back. - No, but... - Sorry. I'll be right back. - Well? - Listen... I've spent 3 hours trying, but she won't leave her room. - Sort it out! - It's hopeless. It isn't. Get her out! - Sorry about that. - I have a problem. There are two cameras. Which one do I play to? No, but... You're with Anna. Just act by yourself. Forget the cameras. I have another deeper problem. I don't know how to play my death. That's in a later scene. - All right. - Don't worry. OK. For now I... Well? It isn't going to happen today. You'll have to do other scenes. I don't have any, I can't. You knew what she was like. Yeah, right! Anna can't make it. She won't leave her room, I don't know why. So we'll have to... - Are you sure? - Positive. So that's it for today, but we'll continue tomorrow. - But I was geared up. - Me too. I was looking forward to seeing you with Anna at last. Manon! Yes? I'll come see you in your room later. - I was all geared up. - I know. - See you later. - See you. - What a shame! - I have a problem... I don't know how to play my death. You can't play death. THE LION SLEEPS TONIGHT How's Anna? So-so. She isn't sick but... her heart's broken. Ah, the heart! She met... a very young dancer and fell madly in love with him. It seemed to be mutual but... he left her just before the shoot. He's disappeared. She's looked for him all over. She's desperate and can't stop crying. She'll be over it soon. These things never last long. - Yes! - Excuse me. - All right? - Fine. It seems we won't be able to resume shooting for a few days. Do you mind waiting? Not at all. I'm here for you. Thank you. But... I have a small problem. Yes? You have to film... ...death. For me, it's a kind of relief, an extinguishment, a falling asleep, something ever so gentle. No. Death... is the encounter. You prepare for this encounter between the ages of 70 and 80. The fundamental years in a man's life. I'm not praising old age. That's just how it is. With death, it isn't important to experience it but to see it coming. I hope we'll do it that way. We'll do it how you want, but gently... No, I totally disagree with your idea of death. Endless Dialogue was a revelation. When I saw you with Anna, at the age of 15 or so, I knew I wanted to make movies. I'm pleased. That movie meant a lot to me. But in those days, movies were shot in celluloid. It was a tiny-budget movie so we could only do one take per shot, per sequence. I felt a huge responsibility and a weight on my shoulders during filming. We pulled it off though, and it became a cult movie. It's odd no one ever brought you back together. This was the perfect opportunity. I hope she'll come back though. Think about what I said about death. I will, don't worry. I have to take this call, sorry. - I'll keep you posted. - OK. Goodbye. Take care. See you very soon. Hello? It's true, take mirrors... They think they're deep, but they deceitfully reverse images. He says it'll only be a few days but I'm afraid it'll be longer. You'll be on vacation for a while, Jean. Never mind, I can wait. An old friend of mine lives nearby. I'll be able to go visit her. Goodbye. Are you all right, sir? Fine, thank you. Would you like a glass of water? No, I'm all right. Thank you. But does Marie Berthier live here? Marie's my grandma. She lives just upstairs. I think she's out. Would you like to wait with me? No... What's your name? - Yuki. - Yuki... I'm Jean. - Here, Yuki. - Thank you. - Give your grandma my best wishes. - OK, I will. - Do you need a hand? - No, thank you. Grandma! A man came to see you. He brought you these. Jean! I was in the area so I thought... How did you find my address? You wrote me a letter a while ago. So I did. - Leaving already? - Yes. What's nice about you is, you don't change. I'm glad I saw you. Are you sure this is where you wanted to come? It isn't me you want to see. DANGER OF DEATH What's wrong? - What is it? - Someone's in there... Quick! Run faster! - Who is that guy? - He's nuts, totally nuts! It isn't your house! You're not nice! You're a meanie! You're crap! Juliette! I didn't think I'd see you again. But here I am. You left saying you were going for a walk. I'm sorry. Long ago I made you suffer for no reason. And I made myself suffer. "Long ago" is pretty. It's like a story set in the past. Long ago there lived a king and queen in a land of talking animals. "Long ago" is something we have lost forever. Are you saying the story we're in right now isn't over? Of course not. We're together now. I'm so happy! But don't tell me how it ends. How could I? I don't even know myself. What were you doing all this time? I was waiting for you. Because you were sure I would be back? No, but I was sure I wouldn't be without you, one way or another. You're not like other people. Neither are you, or we wouldn't be here together. So don't regret it more than I do. Yes... because it was you, because it was me, because it was us... I've never loved anyone but you. Are you sure? It took me ages to realize. I knew from the start. I saw you earlier. Was it really you? It's weird, he spoke. What's her name? Juliette de Garron. 1949-1972. That makes her... She didn't live long. She died young. Yeah. Maybe she was his sister. Or his wife. Yes, maybe. I think she's his sister. Or his girlfriend. His spouse... - Yes! - Dad, the boys want to see you. - Hi! - You OK? The door... There's a screening. We've something to show you. What's up? We wanted to show you some footage. - Cool! - Right... - Come on. - Hang on. Have you made a movie? No, we just shot some stuff. That's Jules filming. His specialty is filming the floor and his feet. - The house is huge. - Yeah, I know but... You've seen the outside. Now you can see inside. There are tons of books! - Old books. - They're all rotten. And a cross-eyed Louis XIV! Did you see any...? - Whose fingers are those? - That's Jules. Did you get your parents' permission? Of course not! No. They gave themselves permission! - Hey, leave that! - I can't concentrate. That was in a graveyard. We followed the... We went back to the house. There was a man inside who scared us. And you followed him? Yes, because we didn't know who he was. You shouldn't do things like that. It was risky because... He's old, he didn't see us. Of course he saw you! - No, he didn't. - No way! What do you want to do with it? We'd like to shoot a film in the house, but now that man's there... We wanted your opinion. It's always the same... If you want to film anywhere, you have to ask permission. Same goes for filming someone. It's as simple as that. There's nobody. No one's here. Give me the binoculars. We need to see if he's there. Hey, grandpa, it's time to get up! Come on, old geezer! You old fossil! - Get a move on! - I bet he's deaf. Hey! It isn't right to call people names. Come out, you old fossil! What are you doing? You've no business here! It's private property. Scram! Is anyone there? Who are you? Claude! Jean! I saw Juliette. You mustn't stay here. I heard you were ill. Are you OK? You look terrible. When did Juliette die? In 1972. I didn't know where you were, I couldn't let you know. I heard it was suicide. No... No one knows if it was an accident or suicide. Do you mind if I stay here? But I saw Juliette. I spoke to her. She heard me. I kissed her and held her. She's dead? Yes. He can't climb over the wall. We can easily though! Yeah! We can climb over the wall and knock him out... That's a bit much! - Let's distract him. - The door opened! What? Who is it? The madman! Quick, hide! It's the old bum! Come on. Come on! Thank you, sir. Goodbye! Come on, carry! Carry! Carry this! Carry! - What? - Hey, stop! Carry! Carry this! - Get back! - What's his problem? He's totally wacko. What's he doing? - What, what, what? - Watch out! Sicko! Hey, calm down! What are you doing? Hey, you're mad! Come on, carry this! - What's his problem? - Carry! Careful. No, Jules! Come back. Why are you doing that? - He's totally mad! - The guy's mad. - He threw apples at us! - He's cracked. The guy threw apples. What are you doing? Hi! We don't know. We're not really sure. The old man threw apples at us. - He's a weirdo, watch out! - Yeah, he's mean. Are you coming? - We're going too. - What? And the shopping? You do the shopping, we want to go with them. Come on, Charlie. Charlie! Come on! Focus on him. See how big it is? It isn't very nice though. What's he doing? Hey, sir... You could say thank you! Hey grandpa, say thank you! We carried your shopping. Show us some respect! - Don't knock so hard. - What a nice guy! Thank you! You're welcome. My name's Jean, not grandpa. My name is Jean. I'm Mathis. - I'm Jules. - How do you do? - I'm Adrien. - How do you do? - I'm Louis. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Rafaele. How do you do? - Coline. - How do you do? - Tom. - How do you do? What about me? - Goodbye. - And me? Thanks a lot! Nice! - That's enough. - Sir? - Are you there? - Stop! - Yes? - Is this your house? I'm living here for now. Who are you? I'm an actor. An actor? An actor? Hey, sir... We could ask him if we can make our movie here. Yeah, go on! Yes? What is it? Could we make... a movie in your house? A movie here? Yes, of course you can. Could you act in it? Would you like to? But what kind of movie? - A funny one. No, an action movie. - Funny! - No, action! One that's scary! Yeah, scary! What do you like? All right, but first... you have to write a script. A what? First you have to write a script. - No way! - Yes. You have to write. Discuss it and write a script. - Not a script! - No, sir! I guess we'll have to write one. He's agreed to let us shoot here. That's something. For the special effects, we can ask Philippe. What's all this about a movie? Well, we wanted to make a movie and we found this house but... - He lives here. - It's full of pictures. - Let's call Philippe. - What is this house? It's here. Look at this place! It's too flashy to be secret! "Juliette de Garron's grave." "1949-1972." - We film the cemetery. - We investigate. Investigate? We have 2 places, the cemetery and the house. I wrote that down. "Johnson, what's going on?" "Jack, I found something!" "We've found the body..." "of a 97-year-old woman." Look, we've got this dark and scary house - so we make a horror movie. - Yeah. But... Go on. So it's Juliette's portrait? It's a haunted house... - Juliette could be... - We don't know! - Our theory is it's her portrait. - We could ask Jean. Careful, Romain, it's going to fall. If he says it's her, we do a movie like this... You know, Jean's wife dies and we start spying on him. I have an idea! It wasn't a natural death. Her ghost takes revenge. Maybe she was murdered. Yes, so she comes back to take revenge. Rafaele, write! We film the outside, or no one'll know where it is. They'll just see the inside. It could be the hideout of paranormal hunters who kill the witch and ghosts. Who's playing the hunters? - I want to hunt! - And the ghost of the girl, of Juliette? - I'm a hunter! - Let's work out the cast. Who wants to be a ghost hunter? - The 3 youngest should be. - Yeah, the 3 littlest! - That means you. - Yeah, right! Juliette's ghost could be young. The little ones always get the crappy roles! For sure! No one will have a crap part. Either you play a bad guy, a nasty ghost... - I want to be a hunter. - Me too! May I know what sir was doing all this time? You know very well. I'm an actor. I knew it! Tell me something, perform something. No. - I can't. - Why not? I don't know. But I have the feeling something was stolen from me. - What did you do? - I left. God gave it to me, took it back and will return it. We think of Him when down, but when we're fine... All we can do now is wait and hope. Hope springs eternal but does not nourish. Why the long face? Aren't you pleased I came? Yes. I am but... while you were gone I thought of things. Which? It'd take too long to explain. Keep your secrets, young lady. "No sage can dream such beauty as a fool." I tried but I couldn't do it. I couldn't help myself. It took you ages to realize. I'm going for a walk. For a walk? I won't go far. You're leaving me alone? I need air. There's air here! I need fresh air. Don't be surprised if I'm gone. - You want to leave? - Just watch me! I won't stop you. I won't force you to stay. You came freely and you can leave freely. You'd like that, eh? Do you regret what you did? Afraid it'll get complicated? You'd let me leave and get lost in the dark? Of course not! Stop it. You know I need you as much as you need me. You do? Yes, really. You hugged me this time. I call in the void I call you in the dead of night My words disappear so quickly Will they reach you today? Hello, hello, can you hear me? Is it sunny over there, under your sky? Here, even in the rain I'm reminded by the smell A little of the Esterel I am in the booth Shut in a glass cage And I imagine you In a bar overlooking the sea Hello, hello, can you hear me? Is it sunny over there, under your sky? Here, even in the rain I'm reminded by the smell a little of the Esterel Why did you say I was free? Because you are. I am in the booth I call you in the dead of night My words disappear so quickly Will they reach you today? Hello, hello, can you hear me? Is it sunny over there, under your sky? Jean! Jean, are you there? It's deserted. No one's there. - Let's go. - There isn't a soul. Jules! If he's really gone, I don't know... Who's there? Password? Banananana. Look, if he isn't there, we use another place. - No. - Yes! - We need somewhere else! - I want to stay here. We find another place! Romain, that's my scarf, but don't worry! I think it's a waste of time to stay here and look for him. He isn't coming back. Well, I like Jean! So do we! But we've no choice if we want to make the movie. If you don't want to stay, it means I care more for him. No, it doesn't! We just want to make our movie. He'll be there! We want to shoot. I'm sure he will be. Look, he isn't there! There's no point trying to make it here... We've only been 3 times. Don't you get it? Jean is not there! He's gone. We want to make our movie, but we still like Jean! I want Jean in the movie. He can still be in it, but not in the house. How will we find him? We'll figure it out. We found that house, we can find a better one. What's unique about it? I saw another house. It was perfect, run down... No one was in it. There you go! When did you see it? - I don't remember. - Read this! It was... Shut up! - On my way to the store. - Shut up! No, you shut up! Firstly, you know what? - OK, so maybe... - We're staying here! - Yeah, but... - We're not staying here! - I'm fed up! - Go then! I'll go on my own. - Get lost! - Hey, calm down. No! Go! Go on, go! - Let's lock them out. - Yeah! Go on, lock them out! They're pains in the ass. Lock them out. Go on. Isn't life great? We'll block it with... Let go. Get off! - Jules? - Come in. - Are you OK? - Fine. And you? Why are you on your bed? I was resting. Why are you tired? I played video games with Tom. - And it tired you out? - Yes, it did. I'm the one who does the cleaning around here. No! Quick! Let go! Right... - I really like westerns. - Great! Thank you! That was a nice meal, son. Jules, I've got something to say. Could you sit down? For the holidays... I need a vacation or I'll go mad again... like now. Simon would like us to go away together. - And? - To a chalet in the mountains. Well, the break would do us good, and the two of you could get to know each other. You needn't decide now. You're free to say... yes or no. It would make me happy. I'll think about it. Jules! - Oh hi. - Hey! You OK? Not great. What's wrong? They want to change location. Why? Because Jean's gone. We've been 3 times. The door's locked. Have you been today? No, there's no point. I've given up. Well, I haven't. Let's go. No! It's pointless. It's my project too, you know! No, it's pointless. Try being in my shoes! If I want to go, we'll go. - Come on. - No. If you don't go, I'll go on my own. Go in, it's open. Wait. Are you OK, Jean? - Who are you? - I'm Jules. The other day you asked us to write a script. So I did. Do you want to go to hospital? Ah no, no, no. What are you doing here? We brought you the script. Ah yes, the script. - Here. - Thank you. Are you hungry? Yes, I'm starting... to feel a bit hungry. Would you like some food? That'd be nice. Bring me something to eat. We won't be long. I'll tell Rafaele and Emma. He shouldn't be alone. "It's the story of some children..." Shush! Listen to her. "It's the story of some children" "who find a derelict house." Why don't you stand up? Yes, stand up. "In a room, they see" "a man talking to himself." "He's actually talking to his wife..." "who's dead." "The children see the ghost," "who is very annoyed and scary." "The children take fright and run for it," "but they can't get out" "and, one by one, they turn into ghosts." "Except for one child, who rushes to the phone" "and dials Ghostbusters." "The ghostbuster squad..." "turns up and kills the ghosts" "by turning them into humans." That's very good. Can I have some more? Jean, do you want some water? So... I play the lead in this movie? - I speak to the ghost? - Yes. I see. - Is that it? - Yes. But, sir... Last time you told us you were an actor. Is that actually true? We didn't believe you. If he says he is, then he is! Maybe he isn't. Sometimes you lie to people you don't know. Are you a real actor? Before maybe? Hey, Charlie! No. I'm a real actor. How many movies have you made? - He's forgotten. - Not that many, but... they were beautiful movies. I'm glad I'm an actor. What do you want to be? - This soup's delicious! - What do I want to be? An actor. - An actor? - I want to write scripts. - You do, eh? - I want to be a designer. - A what? - A designer. A fashion designer? That's a good job. How old are you, young lady? I'm 7. 7 is good. It's the age of reason. Isn't 8 the age of reason? No, it's 7! Isn't it really 30? And my age, over 70, it's the age of unreason. Unreason! That's why I see ghosts. - More soup, anyone? - No, thanks. How old are you? - I haven't finished mine. - Have my soup. How old are you? I'm over 70. Are you 71? - More. - 72? 72. Personally, I believe that... the most interesting time in life is between 70 and 80. So you've plenty of time. You do things before but... between 70 and 80 is important. Why between 70 and 80? Why? Because... something falls apart. You realize you're no longer... and you expect... the encounter. The encounter? We forgot the serviettes. The encounter with a girl! The encounter. With what? Do you have a wife? Do I have a wife? Only one woman stayed with me but... all the others ran away. The only one who stayed became my wife. At the same time, the woman I really loved... was... 30 or 40 years ago. She comes to see me here. When you were at the grave, whose grave was it? - We saw it. - It said "Juliette de Garron". It's the grave of the woman I loved. Ah, she's dead! She didn't live long. She's the woman in the movie you want me to play in. Jean. Let's go for a walk. Coming? Remember? Up there? Remember what it is? - It's a star. - But which? I don't know. - Its name? - I don't know. It's Betelgeuse. That's hardly a brilliant name. Yet it shines so brightly! - Will you remember? - Yes. And that? That's Cassiopeia. And that? That's Orion the Hunter and Sirius, his dog. And that? Arcturus, Bouvier's double star. How do I know you're not joking, making all this up? I can do that too. Aspirus, Hitsis, Noromeges, Vorloge... I didn't think we'd be able to walk together again, the two of us. I don't know how the story ends. Which story? Yours, mine, ours... - A declension...? - The one we're living now. You want to know the end? All stories end the same way. - All of them? - Without exception. How? In death. That isn't funny. Funny or not, death is life. The shadow of life. You have to walk hand in hand with death through life. Isn't that so? But you're an actor. You can die as many times as you like. You have many deaths and lives within you. I can't play my death. Why not? Charles, André, Alexandre... They have all departed and so have you, Juliette. Why do you look sad? I know you'll ditch me again and go back to the life you left long ago. See? I'm talking like you, like a woman who's already old! I'm not going to dump you. I'll take you wherever you want henceforth. Henceforth? It's the opposite of "long ago". I like it. I prefer it to "long ago". Camera rolling! Action! Let's go that way. You're toast! Wait! Vacuum her! - Vacuum her now. - Let's go! Let's check upstairs. Cut! Let's do another take. That's what I think too. - One last take. - This one's fine! - Yes, but... - It was good! Scene 13, take 1. You're ridiculous! You lot attack them, OK? Action! Switch on your lights. Watch out! There are more ghosts. The light kills them. They're getting up! Cut! I'm suffocating. I couldn't see anything. - Want to be boom operator? - Yes. It's there. Who's clapper loader? Mr. Jean, you're sitting in this armchair. - When the scene starts? - Yes. And you're talking to... You're gesticulating at the ghost. - So I'm there? - Yes, you are. - Do you need help? - I'm fine. I'm playing the ghost. Sit down. And Coline is playing the ghost. - All right? - Yes. He has to leave through here. - You go out that door. - OK. Looking frightened... When I come in and the door closes, you get up and leave. Is that all right? You get up and go out there. - All right. - OK? You go out there. OK, everyone in position. Are you ready? Yes, the framing's good. - Scene 6, take 1. - Just close the door. Come on. Camera rolling! Scene 6, take 1. Action! Open the door! My mind's gone blank. I'm not ready. Cut! Yes, cut. Retake. - He wasn't ready. - Something's wrong. - Want to do it again? - I'm sorry. It's all right. - Let's do it again. - OK then. Come explain clearly to me. All right. Would you like a break? Look at me and tell me exactly what you want. So when... Explain things clearly to me. That's how to do it. - All right. - Or it won't work. Would you like a break? No, let's carry on. Let's do it. Everyone in position! - OK, clapper loader? - Yes. - In position! - Shut the door. Are we ready? Quiet! Quiet. Camera rolling! Hang on! Scene 6, take 1. Is that it? It wasn't centered. Quiet! Camera rolling. Scene 6, take 2. Scene 6, take 2! Action! Open the door! - Adrien! - Come on! You OK? Adrien? Shall we do it again? Cut! What's wrong? - What happened? - Sir? Wasn't it OK? When I come in... you have to get up and go out that door. Look scared and shut the door. Like you're in a hurry. As if you were frightened by the ghost. When I come in, OK? I'll get up when you tell me to. OK. So... Don't stand by the door, come here and direct me. But I'm supposed to be acting. With no directions, there's no scene. So give me directions about the door, there... You have to, for instance... When he opens the door, you have to remember you're going to see the ghost. When the door closes, you get up and rush out through that door. Frightened by the ghost. Because Adrien comes in and we all pretend that we've seen Coline and are frightened, so we shut the door. No, door closes by itself. Yes, that's it. You go out that door. You're going to do this. See? And then close it. When I come into the room, you have to get up and go out. All right? - Is that clear? - Yes. So when I come into the room, - you get up and go out. - All right. Let's do it again. Retake! Is everyone ready? Hang on! He put the video on. - We have to wait for... - It's OK, go on! Scene 6, take 3. Action! No, not yet. Adrien? You see... the sea... Condemned to ignorance, the sea knows nothing and will never know anything. But careful, if you stray from the shore, as you can't swim and I can't either, I won't be able to come after you despite all my love for you. OK... Sir, it wasn't that at all. Cut! Jean, could you help us with our movie? I'm a bit tired. Yes? Are you all right? Yes, fine. I'm going to sleep for a bit. Jules. Juliette is alive. You really saw her? Yes, I did. Believe me. I do. But... if you... But if you can see the dead... why can't I see my dad? Is he dead? Yes, he died in a car crash when I was 7. And you'd like to see him? Yes. But I only see him in my dreams. If you saw his ghost, you'd be happy not scared. Hi. What time do you call this? - What time is it? - It's 8 PM. What time did we agree on? - What time did we say? - 7 PM. I had a dinner date with Simon. Where have you been? - Jules! - I was at a friend's. Why did you forget about me? I didn't see the time. I was worried sick. Take that off. When I wait an hour for you and don't know where you are, I get so scared. If something happened to you, I wouldn't even know. You can't do that to me. I hope Simon's still at the restaurant. What about our vacation? - Yes. - Yes, what? Just yes. You agree? Yes. Right, I'll tell him. Button this for me. You don't have to love Simon. But give him a chance. All right? No one's replacing your dad. No one can replace him. I can't be waiting for you and getting into such a state. Pumpkin. Is everyone ready? Yes. I guess so. How long is it, Adrien? About 7 minutes or so. - But it isn't the final cut. - OK, first cut. Do you have a title? The House of Horror. Here goes! Hey, stop talking! This is going to be so funny! Look! It's too funny! Someone dies. I love this bit. It's the same movement twice. It's awesome! "Drill there!" Hey, look at Coline! "I'm going to..." Vacuum her! Get back, get back! That's me... - I flattened her! - I got my torch out. He was on your head, Jules! I know! And he was on my legs! The end! What did you think of the movie, Jean? - It's very simple. - Hang on! It isn't finished. But I can still say... I think the movie is very simple, very beautiful. And you can sense... the sheer pleasure of making movies. Blooper reel! There are many ways to approach cinema. Some people make movies because it's serious. It's a grave matter. But it's obvious you really enjoy making movies. And that's wonderful. It's beautiful, simple and it's for pleasure. - She's looking at me. - Stop laughing! - Coline was looking at me. - It's the blooper reel. - Is there more? - No. No, that's it. Well done, kids! That's the way to make movies. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Jean. Give Adrien a big hand! It's pretty good. It's full of great ideas. For the final scenes, we need a new location because so far it's all set indoors. And as Jean's character has left the house... I've got an idea. As Jean has left... and we haven't... used Charlie yet, we could say he's Jean. I mean, Jean's Charlie. What? But how? Well, you transform him, you replace Jean with Charlie. Or Charlie with Jean. I think I've got a good idea. I know a place not far from here, a very, very, very beautiful lake. I think we could end the movie there. That's a good idea. It's a wonderful spot. There aren't many lakes in the area... I remember! You know a lake near here? I went there with my dad. I don't see where you mean. Is it a pretty place? If anyone has their swimsuit... No, it isn't to play, it's to finish the movie. A lake's a beautiful spot. In the jungle The mighty jungle A cry rang out The lion sleeps tonight Ah, it's that song... In the jungle The mighty jungle A cry rang out The lion sleeps tonight Near the village, the peaceful village The lion sleeps tonight No more rage... In the jungle The mighty jungle A cry rang out The lion sleeps tonight Come on, louder, louder! No, but the tripod... I'm going to hold the camera. It doesn't matter. Move it slightly so it isn't in the way. It's pebbly! She's freezing! Why did you change me? I'd like you to change me back. No. Or I'll be alone. Cut! That was great. Shall we do another take? But I saw your arm at one point. Coline, you can stay where you are. Let's do it again. We'll do another. Am I in this scene or not? No, you're not. You can go. Are you serious? Why did you betray your friends? Who are you? Lou-Ann, hold onto your cape. Protect yourself with it. Use it like a shield. It's windy! Hold it lower down. - Hold the bottom. - Yeah, that's it. - What a pain! - Yes, right there. It's windy. Mind the ground. Hey, you! Don't drool on me. Had enough of her sandwich? Yes, yes, yes! It's too big for him. It's a real shame you couldn't go for a swim. Give him some then he'll leave you alone. Tell your dad to make gross sandwiches! Maybe this is where he fell in love with Juliette. We used to come here for walks, yes. Happy memories then! This is where she met her death. I'm sorry. It's all right. You like my sandwich. You love sandwiches. Sandwiches are great! Look at Lou-Ann's sandwich. Doesn't it look yummy? And Coline's sandwich! Enjoying the picnic? Juliette? Juliette... See you, Jean. "See you" means you want to see me again. - Do you? - If you want to... yes! Then we will see each other. The sea... knows nothing. The sea will never know anything. The sea is condemned to ignorance. But if you can't swim and I can't either, we'd better not stray from the shore or we'll both drown. I know it. And if you sink... I won't be able to fish you out despite all my love for you. Jean! Jean, are you OK? Jean, we were looking everywhere for you. Jean, what are you doing here? - Mathis! - Quietly... Come on, it's time to go. Mathis! Mathis, Romain, we're going! Let's put it in there. What do you want? We've come to see our friend. He lives here. You're not allowed in here. But Jean's here! - There's no Jean here. - There is! - Who's Jean? - He's... He's our friend. - He lives here. - No one lives here. Come on, off you go. Go on! - No, but... - Off you go! I'm sure he's upstairs. - You OK? - Yeah! Hey look, it's empty! - Look at this. - What is it? "For the children." - A letter? - Yes. "Thank you all. Goodbye. Jean." He didn't strain himself! I'm out of here, guys. What? I'm going. Want to go too? - Laters. - Yes. - You coming? - Yes. - See you, Jules. - Bye, Jules. Take your bike, Tom. Wait for me! We're ready to shoot now. Are you OK? Yes, I'm fine. The camera will come slowly toward you. - Yes? - Close your eyes for, let's say, 15 seconds. - 15 seconds? - Yes. And then... you say your line. I close my eyes for 15 seconds then I say my line. Yes. And then after 15 seconds, you close them again... - Yes. - As if you were falling asleep. - It's death. - That's right. - It's death. - OK? Ready? - Let's do it. Thank you. - See you shortly. - Roll camera. - Quiet on the set! Camera rolling. Scene 93, 1, take 1. Action. Ah, it was a dream. I thought I'd really seen you. Was that OK? Great. Cut! It was perfect. - Want to do another? - Yes, one more. - One more? - Yes. We're doing it again? OK. Close your eyes so I can see how it looks. All right. Ah, it was a dream. I thought I'd really seen you. Subtitles - Christina Crevillén and Susannah Rooke (Asif)
