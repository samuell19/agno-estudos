Do you like it? Well? Do you like it? - Mmmmm. - You don't like it, right? Well, this is living! It's a little small. You can always go back to Paris. I already know that. What would you like? - Two beers. - Yes, two beers. If you don't mind, dear... I'd prefer a Sputnik. Sputnik for the lady. Sputnik? Excuse me. What is a Sputnik? It's a original name... but Americans call it a Screwdriver. Screwdriver? What the lady wants is orange juice and vodka, Simon. Isn't that correct, madam? I was just about to say that. There's no vodka, right Simon? It's true... I'm sorry, madam. Take the beer, dear. And if I don't want it? Whiskey and coca-cola maybe? With lots of ice? Okay. You heard her, Simon. Certainly, Frau Spitz. Do you mind? I'm Carine Spitz, I'm an advertising director. Advertising... because in reality selling soap and beverages... is easier than selling sex or violence or politics. Like in the movies. And this is... Eva. She has an impossible last name. Xebbeebee or Ppeee or Cheepeebee from Prague... or Budapest. I don't remeber exactly. It's a pleasure. Yvette and Paul Murray. A pleasure. Are you also on vacation? No. I came here to design a tourist site. Oh really? Fabulous work! And the lady? She came to accompany me... to relax a bit. Oh, that s good. There's sun here! The surf! Clean air! There's a big party planned for tonight. It should be quite a bit of fun. Why don't you two come? There won't be a lot of people. Just the regulars. No trouble. But it will be a lot of fun. Well... Are you coming? Yes, thank you. Wonderful. One moment, Simon. Here. Thank you. Well, till this evening. Goodbye. Come dear. You could've asked me first. Don't you think? What, dear? What do you mean "What?" If I wanted to go to the little party, dear. I thought you'd enjoy it. You're thinking for me now? Where is he? Don't worry. Pigs are in style now. Your Sputnik, madam. Thank you. So you're planning to bring tourists here? Exactly, madam. Are you planning to do the construction yourself? The company I work for will do it. What company is that? Le Juro Company. Where's that? In Paris. I never heard of it. Oh? You should've. Did you see him? Yes. I own a company in Rome. Oh, really? I have an important company. Yes, so important she has no time for her husband. Have you seen him? Why do they construct buildings so close together? So close that your neighbors can hear when you talk. Where nothing ever works properly. Where? I must find. Certainly they make money! They presured us for years... trying to get us to sell our property. Finally the buyer agreed to our terms... and the deal. Did you see him? Yeah, but we also made money. We sold it to a German fellow. He only cared about one thing. Was it in Italy... Then he gave a green light to his broker. I hope I don't offend you Ms Spitz. You don't offend me. In Italy it's easy to rob foreigners. Have you seen, him? Come. So you've been married for 10 years. And you don't have children... how come? Who knows? I want children desperately... I hope soon. I work for a big company, and Michael works on a boat. We're too busy right now, understand? Has anyone heard from him? Now we have a small company, with an accountant and bookkeeper We bought it last year... for cash. A smart investment... in cash. So we saved all the interest, and we made even more... by refinancing And we duplicate them cheaply. We have lots of cash... and we plan to spend it here. We're looking for places to spend our money... Nobody has seen him or heard from him. If you let this go on, you'll die of boredom. I don't know how. Where is he then? They have their work and we have our desires. That's why you must become active... participate... colaborate. - The way you do? Eh? Well, they won't ever leave you alone. Are you talking from experience? Where is he?! - Who? - Who is he looking for? God. Naturally. Who was that? I don't know! Hello. Good day. Good day. Ah, you're working, eh? Are you having fun? Well. My hair looks like a porcupine. Do you know what happened last night? What happened? Coming home... we bumped into a girl. - A girl? - What did she look like? - She was cute. - Alone? No. She was with a doberman. - Too bad. - His wife was with him! What does that mean? What would you have done with her? Nothing, darling. I only love you. A girl with a dog. We saw her too. In the village. She wanders. Her name is Jeanie. Oh look, a boat. Come, darling. The German lady has invited us to go skiing. Bye bye, let's go. - Come on. - Goodbye. Do you want to go too? No. I prefer to go with you. Come on. Give me the bag. Want some? Yeah, thanks dear. Hey. What's happening? I don't know. Maybe we're stuck on a reef. Be careful. There are more rocks over here. Weren't you paying attention? What are...? Are you looking at cliffs for your tourist village? Now... it won't start, right? It won't work. Who knows why. Why? Great! Just great! How do we get back? Perhaps, we could push it? What are you doing now? Give me a hand. Let's see if we can get to the cliffs. Eh? Cliffs? Why would... We could get out and wait for a boat. Maybe a shark will give you a ride. Asshole. Well? Now what? Now we wait until a boat comes by. I don't intend to spend the night here. What? In such a luxury palace! I'm sure there's a spare room. You're insane. Come on. - Wait for me. - Come on. - Wait a minute! - Come on! Paul! Paul! Paul! I'm scared. Don't tell me... since when? Do you hear that? Don't worry, it's only King Kong. - Paul! - Honey, it's just the ocean. Oh, hello friend. The motor of our boat is broken and... Follow me. You can sleep here if you want. - Thank you. - Thank you. Excuse me. Who do you think he is? Judging by his dress, I'd say he's a fisherman. He's watching us... I mean the dog. Didn't you know... it's natural for dogs to stare. Does it excite you? Yes... terribly. It excites me. Think about the girl with him the other night. - Who knows where she is now? - Yeah, who knows. Maybe she's with another dog. How original of you. Was there anybody we met at the party that might be fun? The lesbian? Or maybe the contractor? But he was handsome and intelligent. I don't know. Eva was very pretty, I thought. Don't be so easily misled. The strong perfume. It means she's trying to hide something. But she might be your type. No forget it. No. No. The dark haired man with the loud shirt. He didn't know what was going on... but he was nice. Did you see how his wife was sweating? The smell of her cunt was all over the terrace. Certainly she must love to spread those legs. What about the English girl? Married to the archeologist. You could take her. And I could close myself in a tomb... with her husband and fuck his brains out. Or perhaps you'd like to fuck that strange man wandering about. No, he scares me. Exactly. That's why it'd be so much fun. Well... what do you think? What about the honeymoon couple? Yeah. They were an attractive couple. We used to be like them. We didn't need these mad games. I told you. Let's try them out. If only we had a child... for 10 years I've wanted children. We tried to have children. Didn't we? Yes, but... why couldn't we have a child. Paul? Paul! How many times have we tried? And nothing! Yes, but it's been awhile. What a lie! It's only been a few months. Three months, Paul. Three months! Calm down. Don't cry. Someday we'll have a child. Do you really think so? Yes. Certainly. Oh, Paul! It would be marvelous! A sense of unity in our lives! Paul! Paul! I told you he was a fisherman. Our boat! It's working. Come on. Let's go! Come on! - Thank you! - Thanks! Goodbye! Is she real? Or an illusion? What is she doing here on this marvelous island? You don't know the excitement she gives me. She changed this prison into a paradise. See how the ocean adores her... Don't you sense it? Beauty. You can't escape it. It's pointless to hit the beast. It's impossible to hurt it... We must take the evil with the good. Do you understand? Who is Jeanine? Jeanine. Please Mr Architect, don't you see the dog that comes around? It's the devil! Think about it! He even bit the man who saved him from a fire. Yes, there was a fisherman who was beating the dog. Exactly. Ugo the fisherman. Yes, the beast bit him. Ugo was never very sociable. Now he only comes to sell fish. What about Jeanine? I saw her at the caves. I don't think she's really with him, even if they eat together. Where does she live? I don't know. She came here a few weeks ago. In the beginning she slept at the hotel, but then... She never talks to anybody. She just walks around. Alone. Then? Then, one day she didn't come back. Every now and then, people see her on the cliffs. Listen to me. Stay away from her. Far away. Why? Are you kidding? She could cause problems for tourists. I didn't think about that. Try Nell... you'll probably find her there. Thanks for the advice. Excuse me. I'm serious. Look for her at Recherle Castle on the cliff. It was almost destroyed by fire a few years ago. It's the one over there. We call it "Hell" because the fire burned so brightly. And sometimes at night it still seems to be on fire. - Did you say Recherle Castle? - Yes. That one. Shit! Don't take it personally. For Ugo... Jeanine is like the gypsy for the hunchback of Notre Dame. I just wanted to get my camera back. I didn't want to hurt her. Really? Then why did you come here to find her? The truth is often found in Hell. Once this used to be a castle. It belonged to the Recherle family, rich and happy. They had a girl. Beautiful and sweet. Plus a dog. A dog of breeding. Such a beautiful dog the madam wanted to fuck it. And then? And then... the castle burned. The Recherle's left with their daughter. That's all anyone knows. And the dog? The dog... The dog... The dog.... Paul, listen... - What happened, Paul? - Nothing. That girl... Jeanine, brought it. She's in the kitchen eating. Don't treat her badly. She's very nice. Hello. Is it good? Eat. Eat. Don't be afraid. You can keep this. It's yours. Take it. Take it. Good. Like that... Hey! Wait a minute! What did you do to her? Nothing. Excuse me. You stood us up, huh? Stop being so isolated. Our host invites us all to a yacht party. Have you seen that girl again? What girl? Jeanine. No. Here you go. Listen, darling... about our discussion. I know. I'll save your husband from bankrupcy. lsn't that why you're here? And so? What do you think bankrupcy is? It's not that serious... in the face of International Banking and investments. But it's important to us. I'll take care of you. Don't worry... Forget your husband. And his problem. So, it's true. You were fired. You don't have any clout now. Call it what you want. They got sick of you. Did you make millions under the table? I'm just like hundreds of others... except I got caught. Wait until the Communist take over then you'll see! See what? A population of statistics? I'm sick of it all. I'm tired of the bureaucracy in the world. The truth is: we're all corrupted or corrupters. Not all. Animals aren't. Even them. Aren't they conditioned by us? They were mellow until humans changed them. We have abused them with our disease. Look at me in the face. You for example. Aren't you a descendent from a turkey. And you're from a pig. And you're from a cow. You're a slut looking for a dick longer than a serpent's tongue... to prolong the ecstacy which gives female the advantage. Who is that man? Alex Regine... very rich. Wealthy.. He hasn't found in theology an answer to his numerous questions. So he came here to find the truth? Questions can be taken anywhere. We need a general! No, a captain! They're younger! Go figure. Where are you going, darling? To prepare the luggage. Tomorrow I leave. Ah, good! Go pack. Perhaps, you'll find someone more compatable. Hopefully, less violent. Michael, we should go, too. We must pack. What? Your honeymoon is over? Inevitable. It's been a month. Oh, the soap. Paul? You just got back? Jeanine's here. - Hi. - Hi. I thank you for the camera. It was a pleasure. I took a bunch of pictures. Look. I'll develop them right away. Jeanine! Jeanine! Surprise! Surprise! Enough working! Time for a break! Start a fire. We couldn't do it without you. It wouldn't be the same. Look what we brought! A pig for a barbeque. Whiskey. Vodka. Beer. Wine. What a party! Ham and cheese! Supreme feast. Everything needed for a cookout. Fire. Fire. A lot of fire. Viva Sodom! This wine is good. Want some? Incredible! How much you eat! Have you seen her again? No. Why? Did you see her? It seems over-cooked. Yvette. Yvette. What's wrong? Nothing. You're crying. Don't cry, Yvette. - No. - Don't cry. Please. - It's nothing. - Don't cry. Please. Please Please don't cry... Please. Please. Paul. Come. Yes. Paul. Come. Paul... Paul... That man! I'm scared! What man? Please! Don't tell him I'm here please! Excuse me. - Good morning. - Good day. My name is Brusell. Sergio Brusell. And I work for an investigation company. Here. - You're a detective? - Uh-huh. How can we help you? You see. I'm looking for a girl. This one. Have you seen her around here? - No. - What did she do? She's a runaway. With a lot of money. But I'm not looking for the money. Her parents have already paid that back. And they don't want trouble with the law. Right? They just want to find her. Poor parents. And they hired my agency. But you haven't seen her? Not recently, anyway. Well, then... you HAVE seen her. Yes. In the first couple days... every now and then on the cliffs. It's been quite a while. They all say the same thing. Well, sorry to disturb you. And if you happen to see her, please contact me. Of course. That's my business card. Okay. Well, I'll be at the hotel for a few days. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Thank you. What? Why didn't you tell us you ran away? You didn't ask me. So we never asked. Are you mad at me? What are you saying, Jeanine? - Oh, really. - Paul! Try to understand me, Paul. On this island I found the best time of my life. It was a great vacation. Incredible. I'm listening. My parents got a divorce. They dumped me in school. And they went their own ways traveling around. Greedy. I suffered a lot. I was even sick. My little one. I tried to resist as much as I could. For years I was confined in Switzerland. Then I couldn't stand it any longer, I stole money. I came here. And met both of you. Jeanine. Don't send me away, Paul. I don't want to go back to those hard people. My father doubles his wealth and my mother goes to beauty parlours. I don't want to hear about their accomplishments. I don't want their gifts and Christmas presents. Let me stay with you, at least until you leave. Or until the detective goes away. Jeanine, you can stay as long as you want. Paul? Certainly, Jeanine. You can stay. Paul! Paul! Paul! Leave that girl alone! Leave her alone understand? Keep away from her. Far away. He's right. It's better to stay far from the truth. Only... Nature must be heard. And it's unpredictable... predestined. What should we do? I can't stand hearing that beast! He's not a beast. Everytime we have sex. He... He's my dog. Understand? MY DOG! He's not my mother's. He's mine. Mine. MINE! Jeanine. What are you doing? Why are you doing that, mom? Why? Daddy'll burn him in the fire! No! No! Thank you, Ugo. Thank you for saving my dog. You! You're like my dog. Strong like the ocean. Clear like the sky. Calm like the desert. Don't get upset with the dog... he can't help it. It's not his fault. Not his fault. Not his fault. Tomorrow she's leaving. You can leave if you want. Yvette! You want to throw her to the wolves? What are you saying, Yvette? It was a great experience, but... Now, you don't need her anymore? You men are all the same! After you possess something you lose interest in it. Everything will be like it was. I love you. I need you. So does she. That's why we'll all stay together. Someday you'll regret this. You'll grow sick of it. No. You don't get sick of paradise. 483 :17,522 What paradise? What are you talking about? You're like drugs for each other. And what are we for each other? Lovers? No. Hardly. We're just a habit. - Jeanine! - Yvette! Good evening. Mr Archetect. Remember me, Sergio Brusell... from the detective agency. Ah, yeah. You're still here? I still haven't found the girl. Have a seat. Thank you. You want some? No. I've had enough. Thank you. Excuse me, but have you seen her? Who? Jeanine Recherle... the girl. No. What should I do? I don't know where else to look. If I don't find her in time. What then? What if you don't find her? You see, Jeanine needs a doctor. She's sick. Very sick. In Switzerland, they had her under control, but here... What's wrong with her? I'll explain it to you. Yvette. Yvette. What is it? Darling. Darling, you're not like the others. You're the only one I love. You. You love me. Only me. And not mother. Isn't that true? Tell me. Tell me. I want to have you. Do it to me. Architect! Yes? Are you feeling alright? Excuse me doctor. I was lost in thought. Tell me. It's too bad. But the analysis is positive. Your wife is infected by syphilis. Syphilis! You don't have to worry. She's only in the first stage. With the pills, she can be helped. Are you sure doctor? Yes. But... But? From the tests we took, it appears your wife is pregnant. - Pregnant? Yvette's pregnant? - Yes. Unfortunately. Unfortunately? Why unfortunately? Because of the syphilis the baby could be born... how can I say... sort of crazy. Crazy? It could be, I said. On the other hand, an abortion. An abortion coupled with syphilis... another pregnancy is impossible. What should we do, Yvette. What should we do? A hope for a child was our only connection. The sacrifice of Christ was pointless. Like all the others who followed and preceeded him. Why, God? Life is like the two Siamese brothers. Whose no surgeon can separate... Good... and bad. What should we do, Yvette? What should we do?
