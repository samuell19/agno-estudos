[GRUNTING] Christ, Ray, you want to lose your mouthpiece again? Come on, use your jab! Box the damn guy, come on! Get out of that corner! [GRUNTING] That's it. That's my little brother. Come on, busy hands, busy hands! Jab! Jab! Come on, Uncle Ray. That's it, little brother, that's it, come on. Stick it to him, Ray, come on. That's it, that's it. Left-hook. Come on, once is not enough. Come on, again. Jab, jab! [BELL RINGS] That's it. You see what happens when you listen to me? Way to go. Thanks. Hey. Hey. You do not belong up here, all right? I'm not gonna tell you again. Now, you go wash your hands and make yourself invisible. Pete, she's your daughter, she wants to help out, that's all. Hey, she's a midget with a head full of stupid. Who's she gonna help, huh? Crisco, can I get a hand over here sometime this year? Yeah. On the way, Mr. K. Come on! Catch you later, man. Hey, do you know who you are? Out of all the girls in the whole world? I'm your favorite? And what's my favorite girl gonna do when she grows up? Kick butt and break hearts. That's right. The world's an oyster, and you're a pearl. And pearls are pretty and they're tough. And pretty tough can do anything. Remember that. Okay, Uncle Ray. Okay. [TIRES SQUEALING] [TIRES SCREECH] Hey, Mr. Abel. Hey, how are you, sir? Good to see you. Good morning, Mr. Abel. Yeah, beautiful. Coffee. Where's my coffee? Coffee! It was not a question the first time I asked for it. You told me last week absolutely, positively no coffee, and I absolutely, positively believed you. Tear sheets for tomorrow night. The Telegrambled our ad. It's nothing major, but we should get partial credit for the next fight. Memo from Finance. The department budget is now officially overdue. I ran some numbers... Did you take care of my bookie? No, I stalled your bookie and your ex-wife. I also printed out your e-mail, restocked your bar, hosed down Mel Harris. Numbers, top drawer, left side. All you have to do is sign off on 'em. You see, that's why I'm the boss, Kallen, because I let you handle things for me. I mean, nobody gives me credit for that, but if I were you and worked for me, I would send myself a dozen roses. Well, roses die, and you might be allergic, but thanks for thinking of you. LaRocca's event briefing, where do you want that, here or the CR? I want him in the conference room. And don't stick the cut-out in the corner. It's my handiwork. Put it someplace Sammy can see. All right? I hate it. I hate it a lot. What, are these guys gonna fight or fox-trot? They look like two homo sapiens or something. They are homo sapiens. Kallen speaks. And from a mile away. What, am I contagious or something? Oh, no, no, it's not a hygienic thing, Sammy. She just gets kind of shy around you. [STAMMERS] I'm sorry you're unhappy with the standee, but, well, we only went with the shot because your guys approved it. If I say this shit's shit, it's shit. I mean, they told me that you signed off on it, Sammy. I don't know what the hell happened. Jackie, what happened? I don't care what happened. You have 48 hours before the fight. I want the two faggots fixed. I mean, who the hell does Sam LaRocca think he is? A made man, that's who. He is the Antichrist. He is the... With a bank account. He is this. An $80 shoe? He is the gum on the bottom of my shoe. That's what Abel and LaRocca are. They're the gum, you're the shoe. How come they walk all over you? Get a little older, work a little longer, you won't be so judgmental then. You think I like working for idiots who take advantage of me? Well, hey, that's easy for you to say. This is not the best job you ever had. At least here, I get to see boxing in person, for free. Boxing makes all the other shit bearable, and if I didn't love it as much as I do, I'd be first in line to bend over so LaRocca and Abel could both kiss my ass. Okay, don't get upset with me just because you know that I know how smart you are. Oh, oh, so now you think smart is all there is to it? That your brain can just plot the best course and your life just goes there? The world is not an oyster. It is a smelly tank full of dirty water and sharks. It is not that easy to swim. Jackie, you need to get real about where you are, which is stuck in the basement. You can't even see the glass ceiling from here. Find an elevator, press some buttons. At least the only way out is up. [CROWD CHATTERING] MAN: Yo, Tyrone, wait up! Listen, listen, clean towels, we need more clean towels. Bad break, Rex. Bad break? I won that fight. Come on, Jackie, you saw it. Everybody saw it. Well, you would've won if you hadn't have run out of gas in the 10th. If you train serious, you could have a career. I would've given you a draw. You deserved a draw. [MEN SHOUTING] Well, he looks like shit, day-old shit, if day-old shit shook like an AK-47. Shut up! You can't say dick that wouldn't piss me off more. It's all good, man. Mr. LaRocca, it's all adrenaline.Uh-huh. Shakes don't mean nothing. Ask my last 12 wins. Hey, Jackie. Hey, Devon. I'm only interested in the 13th, Green. Lose tonight, and you'll be waving bye-bye to your career, your fan club, and the free hoochie mamas that go with it. What are you selling? Sorry to interrupt, but it's show time. [DOOR CLOSES] Let's get the hell out of here. Come on, man, we can do this. Let's do this. [GRUNTING] He's got no left hand. What's going on here? What's the story with Green? CROWD: Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Get off the ropes! [CROWD CHEERING] Okay, okay, that's it! Forget this guy Green. [BELL RINGS] No more, no more. He's dead. That's a kaput. No, the guy's good. It's just like he didn't bother to show up tonight. Trust me, he's dead, and if I know Sammy, he already wrote the obituary. See you, Gavin. See you later. [SALSA MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: Excuse me. Yeah. Jacqueline! I'd offer you a seat, but I don't think anyone would get up. Ah. Thirsty? Uh... Let me buy you a drink. Bowie, hi. Can I get a wine cooler? And whatever Gavin's drinking, whenever he's ready... On me. BOWIE: All right. Like that dress. Oh, the cleaners shrunk it. I'll send a thank-you note. Uh, did, uh... Did you get that fax on Needles' demos? They're real good. Put him on your show, Gavin. He's exactly what your advertisers want. Do we have to do this now? Do what, talk? We're not talking. You're negotiating. Stop it. Listen, if I was a man trying to close a deal, you wouldn't say that. Oh, please, don't throw sex in my face. Unless you mean it. You see how you are? I just can't have a regular conversation with you. You're afraid to have a regular conversation with me. Oh, right. You're Mr. Irresistible. I wish. LAROCCA: Kallen! Come here. Come here! I got to go. There it is. Huh? For the pride of Puerto Rico. You got to promise me you'll wear this for the championship bout. Here we go. Oh, yeah! [CHEERING] [WHOOPING] LAROCCA: Ah, Kallen. Good. J. Lo's coming to the Coliseum next month. I want me and Pedro front and center. Front and center? Consider it done. Done and done. Hey, shouldn't you have that on ice? What are you, a doctor? No, no, Doctor's busy stitching up Green. [LAUGHTER AND CHEERING] Unprofessional pussy didn't even bother to give the fans a decent fight, nothing, huh? Ah, screw him. He's a Polaroid. He's out of the picture. [LAUGHTER] Pedro, I am a man who hates defeat. But I'm not too proud to be candid. You won because you worked, and Green didn't. He's a lazy-ass fighter, and lazy-ass always loses. That's a fact. Right, half-pint? Well, uh, I'm... I'm not sure why Devon lost. Huh? I, uh... Maybe he just felt insecure about his corner. You know, boxing is a team sport. If a boxer doesn't feel support in his corner, sometimes it comes out in the ring. Listen to the Barbie doll with the glass balls. [WOMEN GIGGLING] What do you know about support? What do you know about boxing? Executive assistant. You wipe Irv Abel's ass for a living. [CROWD GROANING] I cover Irv Abel's ass for a living. And I know as much about boxing as either of you. [CROWD MURMURING] What's that mean? Nothing. Forget it. Forget it? You talk like you think you can do what I do. Well, what's the point in thinking that? I don't have a boxer. Do you think you can do what I do? Possibly, if given a chance. A chance, that's all you need? Yeah, probably. Green's contract, it's yours. [CHUCKLING] Mmm. Sure it is. Hey! You don't want it? I can't afford it. Oh, you can't afford it. I'll make it easy for you. It's yours for a dollar. I don't have a dollar. [LAUGHTER] I'll lend you a dollar, Jackie. I'll tell you what, half-pint. I'm gonna forget what you said, since you obviously don't know what the hell you're talking about. 'Cause if you did, you'd know it don't pay to shoot your mouth off at me. I just bought a boxer for a buck. I think it pays pretty well, Sam. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [ABEL CLEARS THROAT] Hey, I'm not keeping him. I'm not keeping Green. It was a thing that became a thing.Mmm. LaRocca insulted me. So what? Sammy insults everybody. Now, you're gonna call him, you're gonna make up, you're gonna kiss his ass if you have to. Anybody asks about the Green thing, it was a joke, a little parlor trick that you and Sammy played on them. You lost your temper. You said a few ridiculous things. You set it right. It'll blow over. Sammy won't think you're trying to grow a brain on me. It wasn't ridiculous, what I said. And you shouldn't be drinking that coffee. [DOOR SLAMS] GAVIN ON TV: Welcome back to the live weekend edition ofThe Reese Report. Fight fan or feminist, you're going to love this story. After watching Devon Green crawl off the canvas, fight promoter Sam LaRocca managed to lose his boxer and his ego in a round of verbal sparring with Coliseum employee Jackie Kallen. LaRocca thought he had Kallen in the corner, but she outmaneuvered him and wound up walking away with Green's contract. The price tag? A dollar. That's platinum stuff. You couldn't write a check big enough for the look on LaRocca's face. It was priceless, and I enjoyed it for free. Renee, it's me. Quick, turn on Channel 28. I'm on TV. GAVIN: Hey, Sam, do you know what a coup d'etat is? Look it up. I'm Gavin Reese forThe Reese Report. We'll see you next week. [SIGHS] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] RENEE: Girl, what the hell happened to all his money? I didn't have a chance to ask. His phone's disconnected, so I had to come. I got here, I was fine, then I wasn't fine. So you called me for "blackup." Like I need Gangsta Incorporated in my life. Like LaRocca is just gonna let you waltz off with one of his boxers. Like any of this makes any sense. Last night, after I vomited up dinner and ruled out suicide, I realized, I'm more scared not to do this than to do it. Devon is a ranked boxer. God practically dropped him in my lap, and how can I walk away? I might as well spit in the face of destiny. Now he's your destiny? Devon, are you in there? It's Jackie Kallen. We tried, we failed, let's go. Wait, wait, I heard something. [DOOR UNLOCKING] He's unlocking the door. He's home. Hey, Devon, did you know your phone's not working? You know Stormy. Hey, man, this ain't no double date. Just get the shit. We don't have any shit. Then why the hell you page me, huh? Why? I didn't page you. Devon, it's me. It's Jackie from the Arena. We just... We... We came by to say hey and you're busy, so we'll come back. You bitches ain't going nowhere until we get our rock. Give my man your bag! Okay. I have a Visa card. There's enough tokens in there for my laundry. That's all I have with me. But please, by all means... [WOMEN SHRIEKING] What am I, a punk? A chump? You can just smoke TJ's shit like it's a gift? Huh? Man, come here! [GRUNTING] Man, you done messed up my heart. [GRUNTING] [ROARING] [CRASH] [PANTING] RENEE: Come on, Jackie, let's go, let's go, let's go! [CLATTERING] What? I'm sorry. I don't forgive you. [MOCKING] "Where's my rock, bitches?" [BOTH LAUGHING] What about that door guy, the way he waxed the floor with both their asses? That was off the hook! Honey, no. He was a thug who out-thugged another thug. A thug-and-a-half if you count your boy Devon, who is pathetic, Jackie! His contract only cost a dollar. You still overpaid! Call me later. I'm sorry. You better be. [SIRENS BLARING] Going to see my cousin Malik. Man, I don't know why y'all messing with me, all these criminals out here, man. COP: Calm down. Oh, hey, Luther Shaw. Jackie Kallen. Uh, I bailed you out. I know you? No, no, not exactly. Listen, do you have a minute for a cup of coffee, a beer? How about a milkshake? A milkshake? Yeah. [SCOFFS] Yeah, whatever you drink. Uh, listen, I know this is unusual. Believe me, I don't make a habit out of bailing complete strangers out of jail. That would make me a nut, a broke nut. And I'm not, I'm not nutty. I'm just a person taking a chance. You might be interested in who I am and what I have to say. If you're not, I totally understand. You don't owe me a thing. If, on the other hand, you are, my car's parked around the corner. I'm harmless. Really, really. The worst I could give you is a ride. It was brutal, you know, it was beautiful, the way you fought. Yeah. I could tell you fought before, I mean, you boxed. I mean, you had some, uh, you had some training, you won some amateur bouts. You were good, right? Do you always talk like this? Talk like what? Too much. Well, actually, people have said... That's a yes. You know what? Pull over right here. Right here. Pull over right here. This is good.Okay, okay, Luther. You know what, this shit you talkin' is crazy. I think you're crazy. You gotta be, hanging with crack-head Devon.I wasn't hanging with him, I came to see... Look, I didn't know he was doing crack, okay? It's sad. Another black man bites the dust. Thanks for the bail, bitch. Jackie! Hey, what's up? My name is Jackie! Crazy broad. What's happening? MAN: Now, Luth, we ain't sayin' that you ain't bad, we know that. But don't be coming up here selling some bullshit, 'cause you know damn well you ain't mopped the floor with no Devon Green, a'ight? I'm tellin' you, man, I gave that fool the old-fashioned project ass-whuppin', man. I'm telling you, yo, his partner tried to get brave and sneak me. I had to dust his ass off, too. You still here? Yeah. Go home! I can't. You didn't let me finish. MAN 1: Following him and shit. MAN 2: What's up with that? MAN 1: A little uptown piece. I see you, girl. JACKIE: I know, I know, it must seem a little out there... All right, way out there. But that is where all the good stuff is, Luther. Like talent, and you... You're talented. So, um, this chance you call yourself taking, why you takin' it on me? Because I've been around boxing my whole life. I... I know it like the back of my hand. I know potential, and I see it in you. [CHUCKLING] I do. Luther. I've got potential? Yeah. Watch out, world. Don't laugh at me, all right? 'Cause I'm serious. And if you took me serious, we could both be driving Jags and sporting Versace. You're a woman. And you're white. You say it like I'm a disease. In the fight game, you are. I'm not saying it would be easy, all right? But I'm used to hard. I am. Okay? How do you want to do this? Do you want to... You want to work together? You want to make a deal? [LAUGHS] Make a deal? Yeah. You ain't never managed nobody in your whole life. Now, how you gonna front me, you can't even front yourself. You're nine-to-fivin' it. You're driving a damn Honda. Yeah, well, I have some savings, I'll do a budget. I'm really good with budgets. And I'm really good with people. I can read 'em. And I can read you, Luther. And I know you want to do this. Maybe I'm interested. Maybe I'll call you, maybe I won't. You're the one who's gonna have to wait and see. [GRUNTS SOFTLY] FELIX: When you pay your tickets, you can register your vehicle. Basically, it is what you call an "all there is to it" situation. Mister, when you pay your tickets, you can register your vehicle...Hey, Felix. MAN: Next! Jackie Kallen. We spoke on the phone. I remembered you, you didn't remember me. Remember that? Hey, Cynthia, I'm breakin'. FELIX: So you say this boy is good, huh? Well, good is a dime a dozen. JACKIE: Oh, no, he's better than good. He's the bomb, and you're the best. You turn more chumps into champs than Eddie Futch. FELIX: Well, I got out of the game for a reason, you know. JACKIE: Yeah, I know you had a stroke in '96. I was really sorry to hear about that. Well, that stroke didn't do nothin' but clear my head. Look, I ain't got time to waste training no cash registers in it for the money. That's a wonderful sentiment and I totally agree. Although, ultimately, boxing is a business. Well, it's a sport first. You know, learn your craft, pay your dues. Money'll come and it'll go. That's why they call it "cash flow." Felix, this kid reminds me of Marvin Hagler. It's just non-stop punches. He is the real deal. I wouldn't have troubled you otherwise. Ray-Ray Kallen's niece. All right. I'll take a meet. Uh, Felix, um, Luther may just... He may be just a tiny bit raw. Well, raw's workable. Rotten isn't. JACKIE: Hey, look, Felix, I don't know what to tell you. It's traffic, it's rush-hour. Yes. This time every day. Hey, Luther! There he is. This is Felix Reynolds. This tired-ass old man gonna be my trainer? Lady, I thought you said you had a plan. Let me see your stance. He ain't worth it. Oh, well, next. Next? Hey, do you see a line anywhere? You stop being a brat and you apologize! A brat? What's that supposed to mean?Yeah! It means whatever it takes to get him back, because he is it. Hey, Felix! Now, Luther has something to say to you. Luther. Hey. Look, old man, hold up, all right? No disrespect intended, but what have you done? Who've you trained? Let's hear some actual ring experience. You first. JACKIE: Was I right or what? FELIX: Yeah, he packs a helluva punch like you said. The combinations need tightening. They're all over the place. Yeah, but he's strong, he's got a great feint. And he's a southpaw like Hagler. He can make some noise in the middleweight division, don't you think? FELIX: All right, time, boys. Well, if he can learn to be a switch-hitter, fight from the right-hand stance as well as the left, he could surprise some people. Left, right, whatever. Was I a'ight? That was better than all right. But you gotta get in shape. You got to get in boxing shape, right, Felix? Yeah, your body's strong. Your mind... Gonna need a whole lot of discipline. Ain't nothin' wrong with my mind. The ring. Get it at 5:00. Oh, no, I don't get off of work till 6:00. In the morning. [LAUGHS] Is it cheaper? No, it's available. 5:00 in the morning? Man, you can forget that. You've got to leave some room in this program for sleep. Haven't you slept enough, son? All right, three years, I pay you two... Luther? Listen. In three years, $250 a week, then I recoup that amount from your winnings. After that, after we start making a profit, you take the lion's share, I get 33-and-a-third. What you think, Felix? Well, you were sitting there, you heard what the lawyer said. She's assuming all the risks. She's making an investment in you. Well, she ain't got to worry. You bring it all on. I'm gonna squash whatever you guys send my way. [LOCK BUZZES] MAN: Lady, that's the best I can do. JACKIE: A grand for all that gold? Are you nuts? It's worth three times more than that. "Worth" ain't the way it works. Well, what about "fair"? Does fair work? No? Okay. Okay, what about this? You give me $1,250, I throw that in for free. $1,250. Please don't screw me beyond that point. I have kids. [FELIX LAUGHS] Hey. How you doin', man? How you been? How you been? Wait, Luth. Hey, Luther, look here. This here is Kevin Keyes, the best cutman in the business. How you doin'? Good to meet you.How you doin'? This is Cedric Mouketendi, your sparring partner. Mouke what? Mouketendi. It's Ugandan. Call me Rick, it's easier. I'm gonna take you out, Africa. A monkey's ass always talks shit! FELIX: Off the ropes! Off the ropes! Come on, spin outta there now! Time! Time! Time. Now you see what the hell I'm telling you about your jab? Stop street fightin'. When he misses, counter-punch him. JACKIE: His rhythm's great. FELIX: Well, it ain't his rhythm I'm worried about. Come on, now. In a minute, when I say again. That's why I put him in with a bigger man, so he'd learn how to move. Hey! Hey! Hey! [GRUNTING] Come on, now. Come on. Hey, boy, you want to fight like a damn hoodlum? I'll toss your black ass back out on the street! You think I'm playing with you? I ain't playing with you, boy! Hey, Luther. Look at me. Look. Look. You can't win if you fight dirty, do you understand that? You all right, son? Yeah, I'm all right. He's here to help you, man. I'm sorry about this here. It won't happen again! Will it? It won't happen again. No, say it like we can hear it! It won't happen again! Hey. Hey. I don't want any threatening or yelling. That is not helping him. Yeah, well, I'm trying to teach the boy how not to use his fists. What do you suggest? Handcuffs? Whatever happened to this dude, your Uncle Ray-Ray? He died about a year after that was taken. Hey, I'll start a scrapbook for you as soon as we get our first fight. So, um, did your dad start you in boxing? Nah. Counselor at juvenile hall. In your lap. Your dad? May he rest in peace. And your mom? Who the hell knows, man? Do you have any brothers and sisters? I got a brother named Michael in Philly. He's a year older. Stupid-ass Social Services. They separated us, and so we grew up apart. You know, I see him when I see him. It's no big deal. I thought we were gonna be straight with each other. I'm being straight with you. Who were you beating up today in the gym? It wasn't Mouketendi. I lost my temper. No, you found your temper. What you lost is the rest of ya. Look, I go off sometimes, a'ight? It's just how I am. It's not a problem. Yeah? Well, the problem you don't have has already gotten in your way. And you haven't thrown a punch in a pro fight yet. I mean, don't you want to win, Luther? I do. I want to win. You know, you got all these expectations. What you gonna do if this don't work out? It'll work out, Luther. You just have to let yourself trust me. I am not the enemy. [PUNCHING] Whoa-ho-ho-ho. Yo, yo, hold up, old man. I ain't into no S&M stuff. Who you think you is? Marvelous Marvin Hagler or Sugar Ray Robinson? You just another young wannabe fighter, come a dime a dozen, trying to look pretty. You need to start with the basics. I'm gonna tie down your right arm so you can learn to throw a left jab. You got to learn to be balanced on both sides. You fight somebody who know how to handle a southpaw, you better be ready to show his ass somethin' different. Now, snap out that jab, let me see it. [EXHALING SHARPLY] MAN: 5:00 is the best I can do. Hey, I need your locker, Lewis.Okay, Coach. Come, baby, come get it! You know, there's a powder for that. 6:30's open. I want a 6:30. Yeah, and I want a blow job every hour on the hour. Is that why you're acting like such a dick? [GRUNTING] FELIX: All right, dig in. That's right, dig it in. Now, jab him like that. Look at that! To the body, to the body. To the body. Combination. All right, push him off, push him off, push him off, push off. Jump right back on him. Jump right back on him. Now, Kallen and this amateur monkey she scraped off the street, Shaw, you said they were nothin' to worry about. That ain't what I hear. He wasn't when I told you, Sam. Look, he's been training with Reynolds. He's been kickin' the shit out of some guys in the gym. That bitch does not find a fight in this town or nowhere near it, ever. Make it understood, anybody puts Kallen's boy on a card, puts his own ass out of business. Shaw, Luther Shaw. S-H-A-W. Just 'cause you never heard of him, that means he can't be phenomenal? Nope. No, you can't call me at home. This is his manager. Yeah, I'm a woman. No. I haven't thought about strapping one on, mister. Have you? [SEDUCTIVELY] Well, I think you have a really nice voice, too. I do. [GIGGLES] But I can't cash those compliments at a bank. And I don't need a date. What I really need is a fight for my boxer. Jackie Kallen for Crisco Cohen. No, he does know who I am. Did you hear me? I've known him since we were kids. How many times do I have to say this? Are you listening? ANNOUNCER: Now put your hands together and give a warm Buffalo welcome to the trio of precious gems, Ruby, Emerald and Sapphire! [MEN WHISTLING AND CHEERING] [FUNKY DANCE MUSIC PLAYS] All that plastic, huh? It's a wonder she doesn't melt in that spotlight. Crisco, it's me, Jackie Kallen. Jackie? What the hell are you doin' here? I got a boxer. Oh, you drove 200 miles to tell me that? You couldn't pick up the damn phone? I did, four times! Hey, look, I'm a businessman, and yours ain't the only number I gotta call. How's Judy? I have never cheated on her. I just come to these joints for relaxation. I remember that, Crisco. How do you think I found you? It took me a while, but I found you. Yeah, well... Great. Well, what are you... Well... What, you got a boxer? Good luck. There's 100 men ahead of you who manage for a living. Put him on an undercard, see what he can do. Hey! We'll never get a fight in the Midwest as long as Sam LaRocca lives and breathes.Too bad. I can't believe you have the nerve to shirk me off. My father taught you everything you'll ever know. Pete Kallen is the only reason you are where you are today. Pete would be spinning in his grave if he could see what you were doing now. Look, stick to what you know. You're a secretary, for Christ's sake. And you're a married man, addicted to strip joints and God knows what else. I am sure I could find out. What, are you threatening me now? No. I'm thanking you, in advance, because I know that you're going to help me the same way my dad helped you. Yeah, UUF. UUF? What the hell is that? Ulterior Uterine Fibrosis. Oh, UUF. It's a venereal disease. No. It's a female disease. There's nothing venereal about it, but it's still difficult to discuss. Yeah, privates are tough to talk about. Most women would've made something up. Anyways, I'll probably only need to take a few days' sick leave because the procedure that I'm having, it's really just minor surgery. That's good. Where is the operation? Well, nothing's set yet, but I'll probably just have it in my doctor's office downtown. Well, that's a little out of the way, isn't it? Unless you mean downtown Buffalo. How long am I in this business? Long enough. Nothing goes behind my back that I don't see. What did you think? That what you'd been up to wouldn't get back to me? Well, how can I think? I don't have a brain. You also don't have a job as of right now, unless you stop with this silly extracurricular bullshit! Now, you will stop, or I'll fire your ass. And you'll lose your pension, your benefits, everything I let you work for. Trust me, Kallen, you don't want this kind of kaput. I'd rather have that kind of kaput than your kind of stupid. And remember, use your jab. Nervous? Why would I be nervous? That's good. You're nervous. Use the energy, Luther. This guy's all that stands in your way of the next guy. Knock him down, knock him out. [GASPS] Oh. Got to get our picture. MAN: Okay, fighters only. And make sure you get the three of us in, and make it square. REFEREE: Okay, just this one. [GRUNTING] [CROWD CHEERING] Jab! Jab him! Jab! FELIX: Stay on him, stay on him, stay on him! Don't let him tire you, don't let him tire you. Get rough with him. REFEREE: Let him go. Let him go. All right, stick that jab out there. Hands up! Hands up! [GRUNTING] Who threw a punk shot? Got him! Got him! One! Two! Four! [GIGGLING] Five! Six! It's over! [BELL DINGS] [CROWD CHEERING] Yeah! Oh, that was beautiful. That was beautiful! Nice work on the jab. Did you see that right hook, Felix? Did you see that? That was great! Yeah, he did all right. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Oh, hold on, hold on one second. Uh, oh, oh. Listen, whoever it is, nobody act surprised that we won. Okay? [KNOCKING CONTINUES] Come on in. Hey. Hey. Oh, hey, guys, this is Crisco Cohen. Oh, hey! Hey, my girl's homeboy, the one that put us on the card. Jackie said you weren't coming. Well, you know, Jackie says a lot of things. I'm a promoter, promoters show up. We don't read punches in the paper, right? Nice fight tonight. Congratulations.Thanks. Hey, how you doin'? Felix Reynolds. God, sorry, Felix. I didn't know you were back in the business. Very nice job tonight. Thank you. Three-round KO. Just like I said, huh? Better than good. Listen, Luther, Luther. We got to talk your next fight now. Great. Here it is. Hey. Wait a minute. What are you doing? What do you mean? You talk to me. He boxes, I book. Yeah. [CLEARS THROAT] We need local exposure, you need an A-plus story. I'm handing you one, exclusively. It's not algebra, Gavin. Jackie, you against LaRocca makes a great quaint anecdote, but don't make a mission out of it. Oh, so what you're trying so hard not to say is that it's a man's world. [SCOFFS] Oh, God. I don't have to say it. You know it. Yeah, you have a love for the sport, but... But I should worship from afar. God forbid I use anything from the neck up. He's gonna have to win a few more fights. Gonna have to climb up the card before I start hot-dogging him. One more fight. What is your rush? Well, I got fired, or maybe I quit. As if you didn't know. The point is, you know what? I can't wait for you to decide if Luther is newsworthy. He is. Luther Shaw weighs in at 159 pounds on the dot. Here you go. They get on the scale thirsty, they get off even thirstier. He's heavier since Buffalo, yeah? Oh, yeah, he's stronger. Your guy looks pretty good, too. Thank you. Thank you so much. Whew. Don't drink that. Don't even smell it. I'm serious. I'll get you another one. Hey, there, Mathias. Hi. Listen, I saw your last fight, and, um... Wow. It was one beautiful left... Oh! Oh, oh, I'm sorry. Um, thanks. Listen, I just wanted to say may the best man win. No hard feelings, no matter what happens tonight. Nah. Stay back! FELIX: He don't like it down there. He don't like it down there. Nice jab. Good jab. Luther, go back to the body! FELIX: Jump on him, that's right. Get up on him. Hit him hard. Beautiful. Great jab. REFEREE: Break clean. Come on. [GROANING] You okay, Mathias? What, he don't want to fight no more? REFEREE: Turn around and box. Can you continue, Mathias? Do you want to box? [GRUNTS] All right. It's over. [BELL DINGS] That was the way to go tonight, huh? That felt good. Downtown. That's the way to work, downtown. What happened? Easy, easy, easy. Get 'em off, get 'em off! [INTESTINAL GURGLING] [DEFECATING] Aw, kid. [GROANING] Uh-huh. Thanks. Yeah, well, that's my job. To see shit coming. [RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] Ooh! Straight, boy. Pop that! Ooh! Uh! [SONG CHANGES] [EASY POP BALLAD PLAYING] [SIGHS] [TUNING THROUGH VARIOUS MUSIC STATIONS] [FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING] Neutral corner! Four or five more miles, come on, grab my hand, grab my hand! Mmm-hmm. Sounds like things are going great so far. Oh, better than great. Terrific. It's over! No. No? Why? [CHEERING] JACKIE: All right, no elevator, but the rooms are huge. Electric's included. The fireplace burns real wood. You got to open this thing on the top here before you light a fire. It's called a flue. Don't ask me why. What do you think? Damn, the place is tight! I think I like it. You know, I... I hope I can afford it. Eh, well, it's all about balancing your checkbook. Oh, hey, did you fill out those bank applications I gave you, Luther? Uh, I don't know. Honestly, I don't even remember what I did with those things. This is the lease agreement. This is for you to look over. It's just the usual, first and last. And, you know, I got you an extension on your tax returns, but you got to get it in next week. Envelopes, stamps, stationery, all in here. So, how come you don't have any kids? Uh, it just never came up, the, uh, opportunity. It could still, later, I guess. I think that you would be dope as a mom. Oh, thanks. You know, Luther, I think you're gonna want to get renter's insurance. Yeah. Yeah, that insur... Listen, Jackie... Oh, man, this is embarrassing to admit, but, uh... Well, you know, guys like me... I don't know nothin' about tax forms, and lease agreements, insurance, or whatever. Hell, man, I never even voted. My former line of business, I dealt with cash. It's either cash on the barrel, or I'm gonna hit you with the barrel, you know? Balancing a checkbook... Forget about it. Oh, hey, Luther, look, you don't need to be ashamed or embarrassed about anything, okay? There are all kinds of people who don't know all kinds of shit. I can really help you with this stuff. We can fill those forms out together... What was that for? For everything. We're the new kids on the block. We expect to be picked on, but we don't run from anybody. I can't say the same for some people. By some people, do you mean the newly crowned middleweight champion of the world, Pedro Hernandez? Hernandez claims he's hungry for a worthy opponent. Everybody knows Luther's that guy. And what, to him, Luther's the Invisible Man? Oh, but I guess it's hard to see someone when you're runnin' away from him, especially if you're runnin' away scared. Now, Pedro Hernandez won the middleweight crown in devastating fashion against a great ex-champ. Luther, with only 14 fights, do you think you can beat him? I can, I could, and I most definitely would. I'd probably knock him out if he didn't faint first, Pedro. [ALL CHUCKLING] Well, there's only one way to see how this cliffhanger will end. Stay tuned to Channel 28. Don't miss what you can see here with me. Exclusively. You're our local guy. As for Pedro Hernandez, if you're watching, this is Gavin Reese, desperately hoping it wasn't something I said. You think I can't smell bullshit when I see it? Kallen's baiting us. I don't care. I don't care what you think, 'cause it ain't your rep, you know? That bitch has got people believing that I'm a bitch. And you're whining like one. It's starting to annoy me. I'm not sittin' on my hands no more, all right? Listen, I'm fighting Shaw. You set it up. Pedro... Pedro, come here. Every piece of garbage I float to the top gets in his head he can tell me what to do. That's a mistake. You fight who I say, when I say. Now, go away before I get upset. [RENEE GIGGLING] Hey, Jackie, what's up? Brunch. Well, I didn't know you had, uh... Renee. Uh, there's just enough for two. It's okay. I already ate. Well, here's an idea. You guys take this. You're not hungry now. You save it for later. Well, you sure? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got to go home anyways. Got a lot of stuff to do. What? Um, let's go, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Good evening, sir. How you doing? Thank you very much. Thank you. Um... Luther, listen. All right, now, this is our shot. Stay calm. Act natural. Let me handle it. Look, look, look, Jackie. Look, I'm down with you, okay? But I only get one day off. Shit, I could've been kickin' it. Kicking it with who, Renee? Hmm? Now, look, Luther, Renee is my friend, I love her, but she has school to finish. You have everything ahead of you. The last thing either of you want is to get in each other's way. If I want what's best for her, and she wants what's best for me, how can we get in each other's way? You look great in that suit. You know what I'm saying, half-pint? Let bygones go by. Life's too damn short, right, Lou? Name's Luther. We want a shot at Pedro, Sam. I know that. Look, why don't you close your mouth, drink a drink, and relax. I got to tell ya, I like the way Luther here listens. I think a win in Tampa could put him on the undercard the next time Pedro fights. After that, down the line, maybe a shot at the title. Of course, that would mean you would start to do some very serious pro-Pedro press. All right? Like what an honor it is for you to be fighting him, shit like that. And the expiration date on shit like that is fight night. Of course. Sure. Sounds like we got a deal. So, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go. I'll be back. I'd watch half-pint if I was you. [CHUCKLES] Believe me, man, I already know how she walks. Uh-huh. Well, she'll walk all over you. Why do you think it's her name on everybody's lips? Her name, not yours. That don't bother me, man. Keep up the good work. She'll be famous, and you'll be... Fine. You understand that? I'll be just fine. FELIX: Look, it's the 10th round, you understand? Don't leave it up to the judges. Go ahead, baby. Henry Armstrong is there. All right? Henry Armstrong, non-stop punches. You understand? All right. REFEREE: Okay, guys. [BELL DINGS] It's the last round. Touch 'em up. [CROWD CHEERING] Wait, wait, wait. Step back. All right. Let go. Break. Step back. Tie him up, Luther! Tie him up! All right. Let go. Step back. Come on, step back. All right, box. Stay at him, Luther! Stay at him! Let go. Step back now. Come on. Let go. All right. [CROWD CHEERING] Yes! Yes! FELIX: Shaw! Yeah! Yes! Four, five, six... [BELL DINGS] [CROWD CHEERING] Abe Jacobs, Boxing Monthly. Hi, Abe. You said this fight was important. Now that you've won it, can you give us an indication what that means to your career? Hey, there's nowhere to go but up. Actually, that was for Jackie. Well, we've always wanted a fight in our own backyard, and with this win, we can. Now, you're one of the few women having any success in this business. What's it take? [SIGHS] Hard work and thick skin. A great boxer don't hurt, either. [REPORTERS CHUCKLING] USA Today.Jackie, any truth to the rumor you're posing for Playboy? I don't know. You think I should? Oh, yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. Marsha Gary, Detroit Times. This is for you, Luther. You've had a real meteoric rise. But we all know that sometimes meteors crash and burn. Any chance of that happening to you?Are you kidding? No way. Hey, look. It happens to everybody. Eventually. I'm teaching Luther the dictionary. We haven't gotten to the "E's" yet. [REPORTERS MURMURING] REPORTER: So, how's it feel to win your first fight? All right, show-and-tell's over. Come on. [REPORTERS MURMURING] You calling me stupid? What are you talking about? Why would you just tell them you're teaching me the whole alphabet? Oh, come on, Luther. It was a joke. That's why they laughed. All right, ready? Picture, press, professional. So you didn't return my phone call about Luther. How come? Well, I've been busy. There cannot be another crisis next week. My schedule is already full. Don't give me the talk show answer, Jackie. It's not a talk show answer, Renee. I haven't had time to breathe since Tampa. Tampa. Yeah, I... I heard about Tampa. We won. What else did you hear? You don't know? No. The press conference. Maybe you don't realize how you came off.I came off fine. Oh, it's fine to act like your Luther's grade school teacher? To humiliate him in front of everybody? Press conferences are so out-of-body. You say what you say. Is Luther still bitching about that? No, I'm bitching about it. Oh. Oh, so you speak for him now? [SCOFFS] Please, you hardly know him. I know him well enough. Biblically. Don't confuse that with intimately, Renee. It's an entirely different testament. Thank you. You enjoy your lunch, Jackie. JACKIE: There you go, girls. Thanks for coming by. Hi. What's your name? Janey. Hi, Janey. What's your sport? Track and field. Oh. Will you sign my sneakers? Sure. All right, now listen up, Janey. Here's some advice from Jackie Kallen. Run with the big dogs. Don't just sit on the porch and bark. Okay? Oh, and don't forget your free socks. Thank you. JACKIE: Ah, there he is. Hey, Paul, come with us, and make sure you have plenty of film. Here's my gym. There's Luther. He's something. It's 2:00. Aren't you supposed to be sparring? Friday's Africa's day off. Oh, that's right. My bad, Africa. Wrong! Africa's gone. I've had a new man for almost a week. Meagan Moore. Selfmagazine. I'm, uh, I'm writing a cover story on Jackie. This is Paul, staff photographer. [GRUNTS] Hey. Hey, hey. What's the matter? I don't know where the hell you've been. You're my manager. I've got the most important fight of my career coming up and you're off doing a goddamn talk show in Toledo. When's the last time you've been in the gym, Jackie? When? Luther, Luther. Listen. I've been doing publicity. Publicity for me is exposure for you. It's part of the business. Footlocker? Come on, man. Handing out socks ain't got shit to do with me! All right. Okay, okay, I won't do it. Look, I don't want any nosey-ass reporters in the gym while I'm working out. All right, I'll send them away. Look, Luther, I... I just want what's best for you. I'm kind of nervous about this fight. All right, Sands... Sands ain't nothin' to play with. I need you to pay better attention to me. Hey, after this, I am absolutely all yours until after the fight. Okay? It's a deal. I promise, Luther. Okay? [PHONE RINGING] Kallen's Gym. Yeah, hold on. Hey, Jackie. Doug somebody from HBO. Hello? DOUG: You know who I am? Doug Doherty. Of course I know who you are. Who forgets the unforgettable? Listen, HBO wants pre and post with Shaw and Sands. Do-able? Well, there's a reason it's not in the contract, Doug. We promised our first dance in Cleveland to a native son. Native? As in local? You're kiddin' me. Luther knows this reporter. He's comfortable with him. Jackie, come on. This is HBO, the majordomo of boxing we're talking about, not some over-the-air, commercial-crammed network. Look, Doug, we agreed to a post. That's the best I can do. This local guy has been too terrific to me. Can he guarantee a double-digit rating? Make you queen for a day? Longer if Luther wins? I'm holding the keys to the kingdom, Jackie. All you've got to do is reach out and grab 'em. If you're man enough. Are you man enough, Jackie? Well, that's highly sexist, and wouldn't you like to know? I certainly would. You know what you need? It just came to me. A personal profile. We get some great tape on fight night. Mix it up, post and pre. Think about it, Jackie. You, on HBO, mano a mano with me. [CROWD CHEERING IN DISTANCE] It's a cliche, but I'm living proof dreams do come true. This is the best day, the best time and really exciting. Just one step away from champion of the world. Yeah. What about a whoop? JACKIE: A whoop? You know, real exciting, then, "whoop," like a cheer. Walk toward us. Give that a try. This is the best day, the best time and really exciting. Just one step away... Whoo! From champion of the world. Hey, pal. You mind stepping out of my shot? Oh, this is your shot? Hi. Low. Very low, Jackie. Doug, can we take five? Who is this? I just need five minutes. I'll meet you at the dressing room. Outside the dressing room, Doug. I can explain. Oh, really? Yeah. Well, go ahead, explain. Explain to me how my deal and my exclusive rights to your story wind up in the lap of that idiot savant. He's a smart idiot, Gavin. And it's a long story, so I... Well, let me give you the abridged version. How about, "Once upon a time there was HBO." You know what, Jackie? For all of your hustle and bustle and bullshit, the one thing that you always were was honorable, in a very real way. If you said something, you meant it. And if you didn't say it, well, you meant that, too. That's quite an attribute. Not a lot of people have that. And now neither do you. Wait, Doug. What is the problem?A little pre was the deal. No, pre with me, post with Luther. That was the deal, Doug. If it was, it's not now. Look, we got great stuff with you, Jackie, but if we don't get Luther pre-fight, my audience won't bite. You become the latest waste of tape. Okay. That's nice, man. Hey, guys. Doug Doherty, HBO, as if you didn't know. And this is his crew, Steven and Nick and Beth. They're here to observe, not to interact or interfere, so, you know, just act natural. [WHISPERS] You guys just back up a little bit. I'll be back. Could you just back up... Get your goddamn hands off of me and get them the hell out of here!Luther! Listen, Luther. [WHISPERS] HBO. Okay? Please. Please? Shit, I'll throw 'em out if you won't! No need to be alarmed, or take notes. He's venting. It's tactical. But we do need the room. FELIX: Everybody out. Everybody out. Come on, guys. Please. They weren't gonna stay. All they wanted was 10 minutes of your time. Well, I don't have that kind of time! Well, you could have made it! Jesus, I do... I work my ass off to get you everything you want. No, everything you want! You still think you own me? That I owe you? You do owe me. Where do you think this world you're living in came from? It came from me. Putting my life on the line, having faith in you, Luther. Giving you faith in yourself. You bitch! I gave your ass a damn chance! Everything you did for me, I did the same goddamn thing for you! That's how you got the world you're living in! [VOICE CRACKS] HBO's in the ring after the fight. We are doing that interview. No, you do it! Our shit is permanently disconnected! You stay away from me! And you stay the hell away from my corner! Do you understand that English? The only English I understand is in our contract. You fight for me or you don't fight at all. [DOOR SHUTS] [GRUNTS] [CROWD CHEERING] Yeah! Break it! Break! Step back! Well, we're in the middle of the 8th round, and I don't know what's holding Sands up. He is taking a lot of punishment, hard shots to the body. Take it to him! Get him! ANNOUNCER: Shaw's conditioning is just superb. He really came to fight. Moving well, crisp combinations. He's showing me a lot tonight. That's it! That's it! [BELL DINGS] Sands is down and he's not getting up. [CHEERING] REFEREE: Fight's over! FELIX: Now, can you see? That's what I'm talking about! That's what I'm talking about. I got you. It's all right, man. Move them back. Go! Excuse me, coming through. Yeah! Y'all see that? [CROWD CLAMORING] You ain't got shit! You ain't got shit! What? You talking to me, sucker? Great fight. Great fight. Great fight. Give me that belt! Chump! [SPEAKING SPANISH] Come on! I'm gonna make this up, all right?Luther! Good fight, good fight, Luther.Thanks, man. Luther! I'll get him. Congratulations, Luther, great fight.Luther. Luther. Okay. Well, we'll just give Luther a minute to celebrate with his friends, and then we're gonna look at the instant replay. Anyway, terrific performance from Luther Shaw. Stunning left-cross, right-hook combination that put Sands on the floor. Jackie, you've gotta be very, very happy with his performance tonight. Am I right? Did you read this? You're glued to Kallen for the next 24 months. Look, I ain't fighting for her and that's all there is to it. You don't have a choice unless you choose not to fight at all. Buy me out like you did Hernandez. [CHUCKLING] Hernandez was a bargain. You're a gamble who won't come cheap. Half-pint will hold me up like a bank. Look, why the hell do you think I'm here? I wanna fight for you. You're here 'cause you're mad. Because you made a bad deal with the wrong person. So you throw tantrums in your dressing room instead of victory parties. I don't minus points for that. Hell, I like mad on my boxers. It's just I don't think you can hold that thought or keep your shit together sitting it out for the next two years. [GRUNTING] JACKIE: The guy with the two left feet looks good. FELIX: I like the one with the two left eyes. [CHUCKLING] [SIGHS] Yeah, I try to make a champ, I wind up with a monster. So screw Luther, I'll get somebody else the damn belt. Yeah, well, I wouldn't count on that. Champ material is just like any other special thing. Rare. Hey, what are you doing for dinner tonight? My HBO thing's coming on. I'd appreciate it if you watched it with me. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll watch it with you. It's a cliche, but I'm living proof dreams do come true. Whoo! Just one step away from champion of the world. Jackie Kallen. Even if you don't follow boxing, chances are you still recognize the name. Kallen didn't just claw her way inside the boxing arena, she captured center ring. I mean, Kallen is a snake-in-the-grass kind of charmer. I'm the one who gave her a start, and I took a lot of heat for it. She thought she was something special. I didn't. Still don't. Back off, fool. No comment. That's all you're gonna get. So get your camera out of my face! Why do you think you've done so well in, for lack of a better term, a boys' club where women are notoriously non-grata? Well, I didn't ingratiate myself, Doug. I went toe-to-toe with the guys. I made them deal with me. They never saw ferocious in high heels before. In dealing with you, some of the guys seem to have got pretty prickly. Oh. Prick-ly. [CHUCKLES] Interesting choice of words, Doug. Look, look, I'm really good at what I do. I'm not gonna disappear just because I make some people uncomfortable. That's just not gonna happen. Just ask her, and she'll quickly remind you that Luther Shaw, her middleweight wannabe of the world, wouldn't be where he is if she weren't where she is, which is all over the place, talking about herself. Her impact on boxing is irrefutable, but it's still a man's world. A heartless, egocentric, self-centered boys' club. And Jackie Kallen is its newest member. Funny thing is, she'll probably think that was a compliment. I'm Doug Doherty forHBO Sports. Thanks for watching. I'm not like that. I mean, come on. Do you think I'm like that, Felix? No. Not to me. [GRUNTS] See you tomorrow. MAN: Okay. Excuse me. Sure. Okay, Joanne. I would've called, but I was afraid you wouldn't see me. There's a lot of that going around. Well, you're right, I wouldn't have. But you're here now, so... What do you want, Jackie? Listen, I'm sorry. I am, I'm sorry. I knew a million people, but I only had a couple of friends. I... I grabbed a chance for myself, and I took a great opportunity away from you. You did. I was counting on it, and I was counting on you. You know, for the first time in my life, people heard what I had to say. They had to listen because I was too important to ignore. That is not an excuse, but it is an explanation. I thought I could handle it, I thought I had control. But with guys like Sam LaRocca, I'm just way overmatched. Well, you changed the face of boxing, Jackie. You cracked some pretty hard cement, hmm? You can be proud of that. Well, I can't be proud of what I did to Luther. We're finished. I accept that. Listen, Gavin. I don't expect you to forgive me. But I just don't want you to hate me. Jackie Kallen for Sam LaRocca. Sir, Jackie Kallen's here to see you. He wants to know what it's about. Just tell him I have something he wants. You're here to make this deal? Luther deserves a shot at the title. It's... It's the right thing to do, so I'm doing it. I'm here to negotiate myself so I know he won't get screwed by you. [LAUGHING] Well, I'm happy to amuse you, Sam, but this is how it's gonna be. He gets a shot at Hernandez within a year. He wins the title, he gives you two years. He loses, close or good, you give him three additional fights. And if he wins those fights, you guarantee a rematch for the title. I don't want him that bad. [INHALES] Well, Luther's the next middleweight champ. You know it, I know it. This is one-stop shopping. It's a one-time deal. I go down the street, I get a manicure. I come back, the papers are drawn up. The terms are clear. Once this deal is done, you're done with Shaw. You disappear. No wiping his ass between rounds. You understand? I don't wanna see you. [SIGHS] [SIGHS] At last. The feeling is mutual. [DOOR CLOSES] Too smart by half. I thought the agency was kidding when they faxed over your resume. I read it twice just to be sure. I mean, insurance is about as far away from boxing as a girl can get. I'm counting on it. You won't have any trouble at Dee-Dee's desk. It's very organized. And Mr. Sloan doesn't expect much. Just answer his phones, get his coffee, and don't take it personally if he doesn't talk to you. Mr. Sloan never bonds with the temps. Okay, Kim, what about these? Those are client files. Do you think you can put them in alphabetical order? Sure. Is there anything else I should know? Dee-Dee would appreciate it if you water her plant. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hello? Hey, Felix. What? What's the problem? You're downstairs? Yeah, okay. Felix. Hey. What's wrong? What's wrong? LaRocca's putting Luther in the ring with Hernandez in three weeks. That's too soon. That's crazy. The guy Pedro was scheduled to fight, they're sayin' he cracked a rib, so he's subbing Luther instead. "They're sayin'"? There's nothing wrong with the guy's ribs, Jackie. I know, Felix. That's why I hate this game. We wanted a shot at the title. We wanted an honest shot. Why should he give us an honest shot, huh? So he can watch the fighter you found walk away with the belt? I mean, he knows there ain't no way I can get that boy ready in time. What am I supposed to do, huh? I can't take this to Luther, Jackie. I can't do it. I can't. I wanna see LaRocca. Did you hear me? Did you hear me? Mr. LaRocca's in a meeting. Look, he can't screw my fighter like this. He is setting him up to lose, God damn it. If he is in a meeting, you go in there, and you tell him to get the hell out right now. He said to tell you he's in a meeting for the rest of your life. Ain't no way I can train for Hernandez in three weeks, Felix. Ain't no way. What's the point? Point is, you still got a shot, son. It ain't the fairest shot, but you still gotta take it. I ain't ready. Uh, you think you the first boxer to have a bad time, huh? A raw deal. Luther, you gotta take the shot. Right here. Y'all put your hands in the air! Put your hands in the air! Luther Shaw! [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] Luther Shaw! Luther Shaw! Well, tonight, Luther Shaw's dream has become bona fide real life. He's about to face Pedro Hernandez for the WBC Middleweight Championship of the World. And he comes into this fight a big underdog. How do you see the fight going, Neil? NEIL: "Underdog" is the word, man. This is a big question mark, I mean, this kid, I like Shaw, you know. He's got lots of courage, lots of heart, but he's really green. And to put him in the ring with only 16 professional matches against a kid like Hernandez, that's gotta be the deciding factor. I mean, you know, Hernandez has made it abundantly clear he has no love lost whatsoever for young Shaw. MARTIN: Here comes Shaw now. [CROWD CHEERING] COMMENTATOR: Luther, of course, was not the originally scheduled opponent tonight. That was meant to be Cecil Young, who suffered an injury in training camp, creating the opening for Shaw. [CHEERING] [WHOOPING] CROWD: [CHANTING] Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! [SIREN BLARES] Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! [CHANTING CONTINUES] [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] Ladies and gentlemen, Pedro Hernandez, the WBC Middleweight Champion of the World, is entering the ring. And what a hand he's getting from that crowd! NEIL: It's overwhelming here. He is lighting this place up. This is the one you wanted. Don't bother feeling him out for a minute! You stoke this sucker! He's nothing. Let's go. NEIL: He has got a mission to accomplish. Hernandez is a fast starter. I think in the early rounds, it's going to be necessary for Shaw to kind of use his legs, stay on the outside, and remain elusive. Look at me, man! MARTIN: He does not wanna get into a slugfest with Hernandez early on. There's no question about that. NEIL: And we'll see what kind of fight Hernandez brings to him, too. MARTIN: Hernandez, of course, has tremendous power. He's undefeated in 30 professional bouts. [ON RADIO] And he really brings a complete package into the ring. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the moment we've all been waiting for. Twelve rounds of boxing for the WBC Middleweight Championship of the World! [CHEERING] Yeah! Whoo! And now, for the thousands in attendance and the millions watching around the world, let's get ready to rumble! [HORN HONKS] It's sold out. Sorry, lady. Move on. Sold out. Here is the pride of Cleveland, Ohio. The undefeated challenger, lethal Luther Shaw! CROWD: [CHANTING] Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! And fighting out of the red corner... Listen to me. Just stay relaxed. Keep your hands up and circle him, you understand? All right, keep him turning. Every now and then, touch him with a jab. All right? All right, now, don't worry about his head, you know? Hit him in the chest, the shoulders, the arm, anywhere. That's all I want from you this first round. You understand what I'm saying? All right. ...Pedro "El Tigre" Hernandez! Referee in charge of the action, Ray Marsh, will give instructions at ring center. All right, gentlemen, you both had the rules explained to you in your dressing room. I wanna see a good, clean fight. Good luck to the both of you. Touch gloves. Let's do it! You're nothin'. You're nothin'. MAN: He looks a little scared. Ain't nothing but another fight, that's all it is. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Second's up! Remember, stay relaxed. Keep your hands up. Come on, Luther! Come on! NEIL: Well, folks, we're set for round one, and Pedro Hernandez has a look of fury in his eyes. [BELL DINGS] MARTIN: And Hernandez comes flying... NEIL: A big right hand lands for Hernandez. Come on, Luther. Punch out, punch out! [GRUNTING] Come on, turn him. Turn him, Luther. Off the ropes! MARTIN: Shaw is taking punch after punch and he cannot throw his own! NEIL: Oh, boy, clearly Hernandez wants to finish this fight in the first round. No feeling-out process here. He must be double-parked or something, folks, 'cause he is in a hurry. Yes! [GRUNTS] Oh, look at that! An intentional foul. That was very, very, low. That's bull, Ray. MARTIN: Referee Ray Marsh is all over him. Now, Luther can take up to five minutes if he wants to. If Shaw retaliates here with the same kind of boxing, this could be a very, very dirty fight. Surprisingly, Hernandez seems to be the one who's letting his emotions get the better of him.REFEREE: Fight clean! Punch out and move! Turn him! That's it! That's it! Keep that jab in there, keep that jab in there! All night long, all night long, that's it! Keep him missing! [GRUNTING] NEIL: Shaw starting to dance a little bit. Oh! Pedro leaps in with a left hook! A huge shot! Follows with a right-left combination. MARTIN: Oh, a great shot to the jaw! And you know what? [GRUNTING] NEIL: Luther's hurt. He's got some hurt. Come on, Luther! Come on, baby! Come on! [CROWD CHEERING] [GRUNTING] [BELL DINGS] NEIL: There's the bell to end round one. What a furious pace! Come on, Ray! Come on, man. Fight clean! How much of that rough stuff you gonna let him get away with? I'm gonna turn my boy loose next! Gavin! I'd pay to see the look on Kallen's face right now. Oh, really? Name your price, Irv. What? Shit. Listen to me, Luther. Listen to me. The only chance you got of winning this fight, you gotta do what I tell you now. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Come on, now. He's charging in there wide open, and you ain't making him pay for it. He hit me low, Felix. Luther, there comes a point in every boxing match where a fight's gotta start, you understand me? He hits you low, hit him back. Get rough with the bastard. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Come on. Deep breath, deep breath. [SPEAKING SPANISH] If you use your skill, you can beat this boy. All you've got to do is give yourself some punching room now. Stand up off him and box the damn man. Box him. Use your skill. Now, come on. Get up, get up, get up. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [WHISTLE BLOWS] [BELL DINGS] DOUG: There's the bell for round two. Hernandez continues to apply pressure, but this time, behind the jab. Somebody's opened a can of Puerto Rican whup-ass out here. Hernandez is just mauling him out there. [CROWD CHEERING] DOUG: And now Hernandez is taunting Shaw. [GRUNTING] Come on, Pedro! Come on! Break! What the... You know something? If he continues this, he's going to lose his title on a disqualification. NEIL: This could get ugly real fast. I'm telling you right now. Okay! Box! DOUG: Pedro Hernandez is very heavy-handed. He's has knockout power at slow pitch. MAN: Keep them up! FELIX: Yeah, yeah, baby! Nice! That's the way to make a hit! That's it! Go right back at him! Yeah! Get him! Get up! Come on, Luther! Go on, there, Pedro! Go to your corner! One, two... FELIX: Come on, get up, get up! Get up, come on! ...three! CROWD: [CHANTING] Pedro! Pedro! Pedro!Four, five, six... You okay, Luther? Yeah. Where are you? Cleveland Coliseum. What round is it? Second round. NEIL: That towel's going to be coming out now. I don't think Shaw's gonna make it through the round. Okay, let's go. Hernandez is a great finisher. Let's go! Shaw's on rubber legs... DOUG: Hernandez is back at him again!Don't. Can he go for five rounds of that? Break, break! Come on, guys! Break, listen to me here! NEIL: Look at that! Shaw comes back and lands a combination! Luther Shaw's doing tremendous harm. And a big left hand! Head-butt. The head-butt, Dougie! Come on, now! Watch the head! You okay, Luther? Yeah. Okay, let's go. Come on! Want some of this? [GRUNTING] Send him back to the ghetto! Yeah! [BELL DINGS] NEIL: There's the bell to end round two. An unbelievable bout. Four fouls from Hernandez, and no point deducted. Who paid for your vacation break, huh? I don't believe this. Jackie Kallen just entered the ring. What the... God damn it, back him up! Don't let him back you up. Felix, let me talk to him. I'll be damned. Luther, I've got one minute. I'm sorry. I screwed up. I screwed up big time. But you have got to get up! You can do this. You can handle it. You are in shape. You can go 12 rounds. You are a champion, damn it! Hernandez is fighting dirty because he knows that's the only way he can beat you. Listen to me. Listen. You have a chance to make boxing history tonight. You have potential for that kind of greatness. You don't need me. You already have it. Always did. REFEREE: Seconds! [WHISTLE BLOWS] I want you to get in there, and you knock this guy's ass off the champ map. Come on, Luther. Come on. Back him up. Back him up. Switch up on him. Go right-handed. Nail his ass when he's charging in. Now go handle your business. Come on, the Middleweight Championship of the World, baby. Come on! [BELL DINGS] DOUG: What do you think about everything tonight? NEIL: As we get set for round three, Hernandez rushes out of his corner! He's on fire again! Shaw is moving better now. Shaw is moving a little better, swinging out of the corner nicely. Whatever Kallen said to him that round, seemed to have woken him up. He pummels that jab now, too, Doug. Double that jab up, baby! What the hell is he waiting for? Come on! Come on! Come on, fight! Come on, fight me! Yeah, Luther! FELIX: Power box his ass! What's he waiting for? Come on! NEIL: Shaw is not fighting Pedro's fight right now. Hernandez is visibly enraged! Yes! NEIL: A big right hand by Shaw! And back comes Hernandez! DOUG: Buddy, they're throwing nuclear weapons in there! Beautiful shot! Yes! [CHEERING] Hey, quick! Get out of there! NEIL: That last body shot on the inside wobbled Hernandez! I think he's cut! REFEREE: Break! Come on, guys! Break. No holding! NEIL: Hernandez's trying to jab his way in, but there's nothing on those punches, Doug! Break! Break! DOUG: Look at this! The tables have turned! Dancing Shaw is the bully now! Switch up on him, Luther! Take it to him now, Luther! Shaw switches from southpaw and lands a big right hand! You got him! You got him! Yeah! Yeah! Go! Go! Yes! Yes! He's cut, he's cut, he's cut! Come on! Come on! [GRUNTS] Break! Break! Break clean! Let me see, Pedro. Let me see! No, no, I'm all right, I'm all right. Let me look! That's a bad cut, Pedro. You got him! No, no, no, no, no. Come on! NEIL: He's gonna let it continue. DOUG: Hernandez still wants to fight, but he is doing the same exact move. Get outta there! Yeah! NEIL: And Hernandez moves! He's out on his feet! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes! One, two... Get up! Get up! Come on! Yes! Whoo! [BELL DINGS] Yeah! Yeah! Yes. Oh, my God! I told you! I told you! I told you! Sing this song together! Good job! CROWD: [CHANTING] Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! Luther! What? Let's take him home! [CROWD CONTINUES CHANTING] Jackie! Jackie! Jackie! Where she at? Where's Jackie? Jackie! Jackie! Jackie! Jackie! CROWD: Luther! Luther! Luther... Hey, Felix. Always good to see you, my friend. And a guest. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey, Felix. [CHEERING] You deserve it! [WHOOPS] Put your goddamn hands up! [CHEERING CONTINUES]
