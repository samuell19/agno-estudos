NETFLIX PRESENTS I'm gonna ask you one last time. Where is he hiding? Your husband is a wanted man. We have orders to bring him in. I want to ask you again. Where is he now? Colonel, let me talk to her alone. Look at her. She's terrified. Believe me, she'll talk, but not like this. You got five minutes. Listen, madam. We're not here to kill your husband, but to arrest him. I'm afraid for my son. I promise we won't hurt him. When your husband is in custody, we'll release him to you. Your son isn't to blame for his dad's actions. Think of your son. Just your son. He's all that matters now. He should be in one of these buildings. Second floor, she said. All right, move out. Let's stay alert. B Team heading up east stairwell. Alpha Team in position. Copy that, Alpha Team. Found the target! Get down now! On the ground! Do it! I said get down! On the ground! Hands up now!

Oh, my God! Mom's going to lose it! - Sweetie! - Good flight, huh? Oh, I'm so happy! You back for long? I'm back for good. I'm not on leave, I've been transferred. That's great. I'm not thrilled about it. I mean, look, I graduated at the top of my class. I speak five languages. And all of that just to pound pavement for Operation Sentinel. I mean, that wasn't part of my plan. I know it wasn't. But you're here now. That's what matters, right? So is that asshole still living up here on the sixth floor? - Yeah. - Still bothering Mom? Not as much anymore. - Let's eat. I'm starving. - Shh! Shh! You're finally here. Mom, you're smothering her. All right. I used to make this for your father. It reminded him of his homeland. - No! - No way. Is that true? Now, please dig in. You're nothing but skin and bones, hmm? Here, have mine. I'm good. Don't want it? Maybe later. Pa-pa-pa. Ah! Mom! - Mom, want some? - No, I'll eat later. Well, more for me. Oh, yeah. One, two, three. One, two, three. Not bad. One, two, three. One, two, three. Keep going, come on. One, two, three. Pick it up! I see that you were prescribed a pretty strong opioid for your migraines, as well as some sedatives and beta-blockers. That's quite a cocktail. Wouldn't be hard to get hooked. How about we strike a deal? I'll refill your prescription, but only after you've met with a therapist. This is for your own good. Do we have a deal? - All right. - Here's the number of a colleague of mine. Thank you. - Good morning, officer. - Sir. I'm Lieutenant Jaubert. Éric. You're patrolling under my command. Allow me. Please, go ahead. I'll wait. But thanks. Lieutenant. - Hello. - Good morning. So we'll start with the harbor, then we'll head to the canal. - After that, we'll circle back... - Excuse me, sir. I'm a little lost. Could you direct me to the Negresco Hotel? There. Oh, okay. Thank you. You'll get used to it. That's the gig. Anyway, as I was saying, we'll patrol the harbor, then head to Garibaldi Plaza. - Who's this guy, huh? - I don't know! I swear, I don't know! - Help! Please help! - Stop! What the hell? God, help! Quickly, please hurry! - Look at me! - Requesting backup. Assault in progress. Hurry! Please hurry! Poor girl's getting beaten. He's completely lost it. Hurry. He's totally wasted. I swear, he's going to kill her. Mister, you have to calm down! Look, the police have been notified. I'm going to fucking kill you! Oh, shut the fuck up! Hey, don't! Officer! Officer! Hey! We can't do that! Are you okay, my love? Everything's all right, sweetie. You're here with us. We'll take care of you now. Hey! We're still on for Saturday, right? Don't leave me hanging. Hey! How are you doing, handsome? - How are you? - Super. Can I get you boys some coffee? Please. Let me get that for you. Officer? What's wrong? You got any Oxy or codeine? You a narc? - Codeine is 50. - Okay. Wait here. Hey, what's that? Is it new? Yeah. You approve? I like it. Cool. What's up with that face? - Nothing. I'm fine. Let's go. - No. Look at me. - No, don't. - Come on. Smile. All right, that's enough. What am I, a matryoshka? My beautiful girls! Yes, beautiful girls. My two beautiful girls together. - Let's take a photo. - Okay. Oh, perfect. A photo op. Hey, girls! Hey! What's up? Oh, hey! - How are you? - This is my sister, Klara. - Oh, the soldier. - Yeah. How are you? - Yeah, totally. - Later. - Who was that? - No one. - Come on! - What? I'm dancing. Oh, snap. Tania! Hey! - Tania! - Hey! - What's up? - What's up, beautiful? I'm good. Hey, this is my sister. - What's up? - Hi. - Aurélien. - Klara. Who are those guys? Oh! Whoa! - Russians. - Introduce me? Tania. - Oh, come on! - All right, fine. I'll be right back, okay? - What? Where are you going? - She's with me, don't worry. Tania! TANIA YOU ALL RIGHT??? WHERE ARE YOU???? Good morning. Oh. Morning. I've got to go. Call me later? Of course. Open that up. Can't you see the bag's empty? I have to check. We're conducting a search. - What's this box? - It's just a box. Tiffany's? You got a hot date? - Open it. - It's just a box! Open the box. Give me that bag. - What's all this? What is this? - Papers. Just papers. Just hand it over. - Why are you hassling me? - Do what you're told. Spread your arms. - Anything dangerous on your person? - No, man! - What are you doing here? - Nothing. Just hanging out with some friends. See? Let it go! Let it go! Not a cop then, huh? Get lost. Go. Fuck. He get away? - I'm sorry. - Go. Go. - Here. - Thanks. Hello? Excuse me, nurse. Where is my sister? Your sister's in a stage-three coma caused by cerebral edema. It's inoperable. We're attempting resorption. I'm very sorry. Hello. Captain Muller. Are you Tania's sister? Can I have a word? Your sister was found this morning. Well, a passerby found her by chance on the beach, and… Our preliminary examination shows that she might have been raped as well. Do you know her whereabouts last night? I was with her… at Millennium. Club Millennium? With friends, or… No, just the two of us. But she left before me with people I didn't know. Did you see that shot, though? The sergeant couldn't believe… You got it. You all right? I heard about your sister. I'm so sorry. I just need five minutes. Right. Let's just pump up the capacity by 50 people. - That could work. - And from there we… Are you the owner? Yes, can I help you? I'm here for this club's security footage. I'm sorry, for what? Under whose authority? Anti-terror squad. What exactly are you looking for? How can I see that angle? Him. There. Do you know him? - He was right over there. - Of course I know him. He's a regular. Who are you? What are you doing? Look, the police already went over all of this. Now, please leave or I'm calling them back. Officer? - You good? - Fine. Come on. You hold your breath when you shoot. You shouldn't. Try exhaling next time instead. Coffee? He's the one there. He is the man my sister left with. He's the one I have to find. How did you get a hold of these images? Let me remind you, this is an active police investigation. I apologize. I couldn't help myself. His name's Yvan Kadnikov. In addition to the nightclub footage, we were also able to find your sister's mobile phone, and there were photos of that night on it. - Have you questioned him? - Not yet. - The request's been made. - What are you saying? Yvan Kadnikov is the son of Leonid Kadnikov. A tech genius who's made quite a fortune. He's a pretty influential man now who some say is protected. Since what happened, Yvan's been hiding in his father's villa. Problem is, they have diplomatic passports. Father and son. And the villa itself has consulate status. They're bulletproof. Shit. I have to go. Listen, I'll be honest with you. Cases like this are complicated. All we can do is hope she wakes up, and maybe she'll remember what happened. Let's go. I'll keep you posted. You only think of food. What the hell are you doing? Have you completely lost it? Come on, let's go. Your weapon. Understood. Yeah. I assumed a soldier with your experience would want to set an example. You need to stop getting stoned at work, officer. This is the girl's locker room, sir. - What are you drinking? - Vodka tonic. You got it. My sister's in a coma! You left with her. What happened? Oh, fuck. I'll cut you unless you tell me. Stop, please. I did nothing. - Tell me what you did! - It wasn't me! - Tell me. - Yvan? Let him go. Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the fuck is this? Hold on, I know you. Get this bitch out of here now. And you are? What are you doing in my house? Your son raped my sister. It's you. Yvan told me about your exploits at the club. Well done! You are the one I should be hiring as my bodyguard, huh? You just missed Yvan. He's far away now. Well, in any case, he hasn't much to do with what happened anyway. Much to my disappointment… My son Yvan… Has never been one for women. Your sister was here. She was with Yvan and some friends. She drank my vodka. Danced in my living room. Hell, she even swam in my pool, practically naked. In front of everyone. And, well… let's just say… I don't have my son's affliction. Mmm, that pretty little tattoo shaped like a diamond, well… What a memorable feast. I'm sorry, my dear. I must take this call. I'll leave you in the company of these lovely gentlemen. Hello? Shit! I WANT TO BE THE NEW WIND AFTER THE STORM Hello? The young Russian, he didn't do anything. I know. I just want to forget. I'd been drinking. I went to his house. People will say I asked for it. It's my word against his. You don't mean that. If you press charges, they'll investigate and prove it. They'll have a trial. And Kadnikov will be put behind bars. Leonid Kadnikov. I know everything. I don't want to press charges. I don't want my life on display like that. I won't do that to Mom, do you get it? He can't get away with this. What he's done to you, he'll do to others. And he will keep doing it. Do you get that? Look, I'm tired. Please just leave now. Live from Nice, the Kadnikov situation… Mr. Kadnikov! Will you go back to Russia? Business is calling me away, but I could never leave the city without seeing this magnificent church that was completely renovated thanks to the great generosity of our Russian donors. Police sources say that your son, Ivan, is the lead suspect in a rape case right here in Nice. My son, Yvan, has nothing to do with any of that. Clearly some individual was just trying to make some money. Well, the same source also claims that your son is hiding in Paris at the Georgian Embassy with your friend Andrey Baranov. Is this why you are returning to Russia? To help your son escape the charges leveled against him? Mr. Kadnikov! Mr. Kadnikov, please answer the question! Thank you. Live from Nice, the Kadnikov situation is still unfolding. What happened? It's an embolism. Tania! Miss, you need to leave. Please, she'll be fine. Oxygen. Five liters, continuous, on a mask. - Oh, my God. - Get a heparin pump ready. Please leave now. We'll take care of her. Bitch. Police! Come on. Let's go. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Hey. - Hey. What are you doing here? I was hoping we could talk. Yeah. Sure. - How are you? - Uh, I'm good. - What the hell are you doing? - That bag. Quickly. I need two Glocks. And ammo. Shit. - And two FAMAS. - Uh, well… - Oh, fuck. - With loaded magazines. Okay. Shit. Close the bag now. You've really lost it. Put the bag down. On your knees. Tie yourself up! Tie yourself up! Now, hurry up. Go on. Don't move. Hello! - Help! In here! - What the hell? The armory! Sir. Listen, I'll call you back. All right? - Somebody help! - Yeah. - Hello? - Sweetie… You okay, Mom? I'd be better if you were here. Where are you? I had to leave. Come back. Come back, please. It's too late, Mom. Are the police with you? Klara? You're making a huge mistake. Do what your mother says. Come back. The woman who tried to kill your sister, she's alive. She works for Kadnikov. He'll be arrested. I promise that. No. He has to pay for what he did. Now. I'm on the third floor. It's clear. Coming down to the second. Understood. Coming your way. The police have closed all the exits. I want something to eat. All you want to do is eat. Okay, I'll bring you something. Hey, listen. - Do you hear me? - Yes, I do. Did you see the car I bought last week? Why do you need that? For driving women around. I prefer to walk. Dima? Sasha? What's happening? Dima? Sasha? Are you there? What the hell? Where are you? Can you hear me? What do you want? Money? - Bitch! - Ahh! We need a doctor! Get the medic up here! DUBAI, THREE MONTHS LATER Have a fruit basket sent up my room, please. Right away. Yes, of course. Yes. I need his support. Understand? It's important.
