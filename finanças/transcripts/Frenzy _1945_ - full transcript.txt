Subtitles by Nostromo Well,Maria,what's the matter? You found a man under your bed at last? Oh stop my dear, make me get down No I'm on my way,let me go up No,not up there and don't you go either Maria,what's the matter? Whatever happened to you? The organ I heard it playing again Oh,Maria what are you talking about,what organ? The organ at the studio I heard it played I knocked There was no answer But the music suddenly stopping And when I looked inside the room was empty And then I went bonkers Don't be silly Maria,it's the schnapps you drink There's no one up there,and the organ doesn't work anyway It was probably rats Rats don't play the organ Oh,they squeeze and ?? Ah Oh,stop try to frighten me Come up and I'll show you how silly you are No,not up there But why? You're not afraid of an organ,are you? Oh,and besides I got some of those cakes you wanted Come on up with you I only go outside the door You see there's no one here And no organ music But I heard the organ played Well,now you can see for yourself No one has sighted those notes for months But anyway what are you doing in here at all? You knew you were told to stay out of here What should I want to come in here for? Mr Garrie told me to get the bed ready in the gallery room Why? Is Mr Charles going to sleep here? And then when I go to the door I heard the organ again Then I opened the door and there was no one No one So I run But When did Monsieur Charles tell you to do this What did he say exactly? He told me yesterday,you wouldn't have got me up here otherwise Why? Monsieur Charles has never slept here before How should I know Well,you'd better get on with it Here are your cakes You leave that alone Get on and get your bed ready If you want something else to do why on earth don't you clean up this place a bit Why don't I clean the place up? Because I have been particularly told not to,that's why Everything must be left just as it was when Minetti was here Did Monsieur Charles say that? Yes he did,that's you up,doesn't it? That's how he wants it, that's how it's got to to be But if you ask me,he's mad Mad like all artists At least you might have done a bit of dusting It would take more than me to clean up this room There's more than dust and dirt swept away when the room is clean There is the ordinary dust And then there is the other sort Which settles on the soul Evil thoughts and evil deeds This studio has it more than it's share Look at it Getting thicker and thicker every day Good stuff But wait until the dust settles and then And what good will it be then? Don't you feel it smoothing falling off on that white skin of yours Good stuff too but the dust lasts longer I repeat all the machinery of the police can do has been done And still we are not satisfied That's why we.. The last resort you come to me -Hardly flattering -On the contrary my dear friend Here we realize if we are out of our depth So to whom do we call for help? To France's most famous criminologist Very flattering But I still cannot see why the Minetti case should come within the scope of my knowledge It involves a young man called Charles Garrie His model Lucille Lindbeck is I believe of your many Protegees Her father was an old friend of mine He asked me to keep an eye on her when she first came to Paris She went to work with Garrie about six months ago And I met them several times afterwards Yes he has a studio off the Boulevard St Michel But how does he came into the case? Well,he doesn't work there any more He now works in a studio in the end of the Impasse de Vauve What's strange about that? This The studio where he now works is the old Minetti studio He moved in just as soon as Minetti was dead He took great care as everything should be left just as it was Nothing has been touched Exactly he pays for it to fall into bits Eccentric perhaps but I can see nothing wrong in it Maybe not But got it from the neighbours say that his manners is suspicious And of course we know he was on very intimate terms with the girl Was he? Well I promise nothing but I'll see what I can do I thought you would I think I have a friendly talk with my young friend Lucille Merci It such a relief to me you come back I was getting really worried Charles says he is all right but I know he is ill Very ill But I know you can help him Don't worry,my dear, we'll see what we can do -So you will come then? -I'll come Thank you You are both still in that studio off the Boulevard? Yes,we nearly always work in the other one -Impasse des Fauves -Yes,the studio at the end Hello,Charles Sorry I'm late That's all right So was I Life is bad anyway I don't know what is wrong with me This is not working not at all well Turn a little to the light will you? -Is that better? -Yes,like that -Tired -Little I think you are overworking Oh,I don't think so Charles,you're not sleeping are you? Why can't we go away again? Somewhere in the sun, the weather is lovely now Got to be wonderful in that little village, the sea was so brilliant and peaceful Let's stop working for a while just be together What the devil are you doing up there? I told you to get that ready yesterday The whole place is falling to bits, I'm responsible to the landlord I told her I told you Mind your own business I pay the rent,don't I? Get out and stay out -You cant talk to me like that I.. -Get out Asch was What was Maria doing up there? Cleaning up I suppose I thought you told her not to Did she tell you that? Yes She's made the bed up there -What for? -Has she? I must have told her I suppose Charles,you are not going to live here,are you? I don't know I thought I might I wish you wouldn't No good can possibly come of it It's a hateful place Even Maria is scared stiff to come in here on her own Is she why? Oh,nothing she said she heard noises or something but she was possibly drunk Did she described the noises? What noises? The noises she said she heard, did she describe them? Oh,Charles,surely you don't believe Did she describe the noises or didn't she? Hello How is the great sculptor and the charming model? I didn't know you were back We are all right Just been at the Salon and as I didn't see anything of yours there I thought I should come over and find where you are hiding them I didn't send anything this year The muses are out of you Nothing I like well enough Let's see the present of them Pretty awful Is that meant to be Lucille's shoulder? Yes,don't you like it? I admire both of them tremendously but if that is meant to be one of them she should sue you for libel This clay is devilishly hard I'm so pleased you come Charles even decided to sleep here now -You'll talk to him -Leave it to me What are you two whispering about? About love How are you keeping yourself these days,my friend? Oh,I'm all right -Sleeping well? -Good -Eating? -Perfectly You look to me as you haven't slept or eaten well for a week Simple about me I'm all right No you are not,come on now, what's on your mind? Now look here,are you my friend or my doctor? Both Oh,I see you won't let me do any more work today,Lucille,get dressed,we are finished When did you sleep last? -Monday And eat?-Can't Drink a brandy I suppose, got to stop that,you know How? Away from here That's impossible Nothing is impossible for a man in your state I'll tell you it's out of the question Now,you listen to me I know what I'm talking about For some reason rather you are in a pretty bad state go on as you are doing, you are heading for a breakdown The mind ,my friend,has the most delicate balance in the world Push it too far and.. -Charles,you must take a leave -I can't -Why not -I have my reasons They can't be as urgent as mine At least get out of this studio Why do you say that? Well,look at the place Why did you leave your own comfortable studio and come and live in this morgue You felt it too? Felt what? Oh,nothing Charles why won't you let me do for you what I would do any ?? Come on now Tell me what's on your mind? You've got money,talent and Lucille Who obviously is very much in love with you Charles Lucille,you can go home What's the matter? She's only gone to sleep,she often does It's common in models, it's holding the pose I think Yes,possible Lucille Lucille What's the matter? Before our eyes you fell asleep again that's all You can get dressed and go home we are finished for the day Let's go home,I'll take care of Charles Ivan Sit down Well,what is it? Charles How long was I asleep? Oh,about five minutes I suppose I'll tell you later I had a horrid dream A dream? That's most interesting, can you recall that dream? No No I can't I can't talk about it It's before I come here But so vivid,it seemed real Hideous,evil forms closing down on me,suffocating me -Same time tomorrow,Charles? -Yes,darling Charles,dear,I'm so worried about you I wish you wouldn't sleep in the bedroom here Don't worry about me,Lucille, everything will work out all right Just trust See you tomorrow morning Perfect I do not know what I would do without that girl Things she does for me What she gets out of it,isn't it? A treat her abominable I snap at her,I'm rude I used not to be like this,Ivan I don't even feel like myself I feel like I belong to another world Lucille used to be able to pull me out of it Now everyday the feeling grows stronger Go on You're right,Ivan I am ill I know I'm ill But admit won't do any good You've got something on your mind,haven't you? Won't you like to tell me about it? No,no,no,calm,relax and sit by me Do you remember a sculptor named Minetti? Minetti? Yes Did you know him? Yes I did,in fact this used to be his studio Minetti? Yes I remember him well Died about a year ago Of course,I was present at the autopsy Advanced paranoia Most interesting case Well It was about two years ago He just married a young woman called Christine Renoir Anyway he had gone some form of ceremony with her I didn't know them then Christine told me later that she met him a ballet school Most interesting a ballet school? Stop it,stop this noise What's this noise,you ought to be ashamed of yourselves You behave like another street urchins instead of ladies Go on to your bars get ready to do some work Fifth,fifth,come on All??? Right,now warm up,and warm up with some drawn on that one will you play it again? Warm up with some grande battment Chord And,one,two,three Up with the arms Polonaise Together One jambe I suppose you think it is good I think it's terrible go on get to your bars and pirouettes that's it the only reasonable you are doing is writhe Good heavens,ridiculous There,that's the one,the girl over there by the mirror Yes I see That's Christine Renoir I call her Christine,dear Yes,Madame Come over here a minute Christine,dear,this is an old friend of mine,Monsieur Minetti Monsieur is a well known sculptor And he thinks you'll be honoured of wanting you to pose for him He's doing some figures from the ballet and he picked on you as being an ideal ballet dancer He'll pay you of course You could do with a little extra money,mm? You are very kind,Monsieur But I have no experience, do you think I'll be all right? You don't need any experience,my dear as a matter of fact,the less experience the better I'll do all the work,all you have to do is to stand still a little irksome perhaps, but not uncomfortable And now let me have a good look at you,Mademoiselle Charming Charming,turn around,will you? On your toes Yes,perfect That's settled then When do you want her to start? Of course it could not interfere with her work She's free two afternoons a week Go back to your practice now my dear And I'll arrange with Monsieur when you can go to his studio Thank you Madame Quite another leg,quite another leg, you've been resting all the time Come into your positions and be ready for the adage In positions for the adage Developez all the bras,right Go on What about her family? Are they going to be all right? No need for trouble like that,Monsieur This girl is an orphan She has no parents A little money which pays for her training -Quite alone -How convenient An orphan We understand each other,don't we,Madame? She worked with him on and off for some time He appeared to excite an extraordinary influence over her She was the only model he used And he turned out a lot of little figures of Christine Always in??? Hold your arms up He sold many of them which was seen all over Paris It was a few months later And do not despair Mademoiselle, it might be much worse Your heart it is not permanently injured Only strained Take things easily and you may never have another attack And perhaps,one couldn't tell In a few years you may be able to continue with your dancing A few years? But then it will be too late What am I going to do ??? What indeed A most unfortunate situation,my dear A ballet dancer who can't dance You have no parents,have you? No money either Paris offers cold comfort to penniless prudes This studio You have been happy here? Why not regard it as your home No,no,my dear,you misunderstand me, I mean I shall be completely bourgeois You want me to marry you? And why not? It was shortly after the marriage I first met them It was here in the studio but it was of course it was very different to what it is now And yet he was holding a private exhibition He had a certain talent, nothing really outstanding but his work had a charm and a quality of its own My wife,Monsieur Garrie The exhibition is a great success From the moment we saw each other there was a feeling of sympathy between us Do you think he would agree to make a bust of me? She was obviously most unhappy Speak to him about it,eh? Oh,yes,Madame,I will most certainly I'd so much like to have one of his works I felt strangely drawn to her And we met frequently It was about six months later When the first visible change begun to come over Minetti He's given up his regular style of work and started on the most morbid and grotesque subjects Why do you make such horrid things,Anton? Horrid? You prefer these,do you? Sentimental rubbish Oh,Anton,I fail you Hello,Anton,hello Christine,oh an accident -What do you want? -Nothing,just a visit Eh,did I invite you? Really,Anton,what's the matter with you? Then,good evening Good Lord,what's happen to Anton? I said,good evening Good evening Meet me in five minutes in the Cafe Nouvelle Ouefs All right What's happened,what's wrong with Anton? I don't know,I don't understand it Something terrible has come over him and frightened He hardly ever speaks to me,just looks and the organ,he plays the organ, all the time,always the same tune -When did all this start? -A few weeks ago Do you think he knows about us? -You mean that we've been meeting? -Yes No,I'm sure of it,but that's got nothing to do with it,it's him There's something matter with him Sounds I think he's going mad -Thank you -Monsieur Christine Why do you put up with a life like this? You owe this man nothing You never loved him or he you He There's so much that we could do together Oh,Charles, you are a darling But it did never work,he'll never let me get away from him Where ever we went he'll find us I'd think he rather kill me than let me get away from him I must go now,get back before he returns When can I see you again? He's going away tomorrow, I can see you on Thursday Where is he going to? I don't know,he never tells me,just go Does he? Very well then,on Thursday Here,same time and don't you be late I decided to find out what Minetti was doing so the next day I followed him He went to a small village outside Paris A splendid day I felt I had real genius A few more sittings and we'll be finished I am glad When are you coming back? You know what happens to little girls who ask questions,don't you? I am changed out here,alone at night I'm frightened I don't like the country And then all this new studio which terrifies me And with all your weird things Why can't I have someone to stay with me when you are away? Because I won't have people spying on me,that's why Everyone wants to spy on me And I won't be spied on Answer me,when will you take me to Paris,like you promised? When I am ready I won't stay here any longer I'll go away You go away,will you? That's interesting Where to? Back to the gutter, where I found you,I suppose Don't worry,my dear I'm arranging for you to come to Paris And soon So that was the explanation Well after that I was more determined than ever to persuade Tina to leave him If he ever saw us together until one night we went to a fancy dress party Strange how thing would worked out Lucille was at that party You think it will be all right Yes,dear,don't worry this is the Right Bank We shan't meet anyone we know here it's just old Jo-JO,we can trust him -You do want to go,don't you? -Yes,you know I do,I just wondering with it You look adorable You know,Tina, we make life very difficult for ourselves Let's stock this whole in the corner of distance I've decided not to listen anymore of your fears -But it's.. -Or objections,we'll go away Quite away,out of Paris,out of the country Do you want to,don't you? Why do you ask? Thank you We'll go to Marseille and get shipped to southwards My dear Christine My beautiful ??? And Charles,my dear friend,what a party! All the noise And the figures do you like it? Now come along here Out of the way Make way for two new guests Come along Here's darling Christina and Charles She will be happy with the ?? Lucille Oh my beautiful Lucille Come back to my ???,my darling And the act will seem poor Come on my friends,come and eat Enjoy yourselves girls as busy as ever Enjoying yourself? Jo-Jo Who is that? That? My dear Lucille,you've never been to one of my parties before You see,you and I and most of the people here belong to the Right Bank But there are one or two from the Left Bank And Charles Garrie is one Of course, it'll take a few weeks to get a few things to arrange I shall have to get all my material together Now get my things out gradually without him knowing Oh Charles You see,he and Christine,well Do you know,my dear,I hate to step in and spoil it wouldn't you? Remember we are artists as well as gentlemen We must fight a proper duel,an artist's duel Come on Quiet please Quiet Quiet! On the word one,salute On the word two,en guarde On the word three,commence Are you ready One Two Three Charles,look,that man over there,keeps on staring at me I didn't see anyone Charles,let's go,I'm frightened But,Tina,don't be ridiculous Undress It was soon after that that something happened that made me realize I had to get Tina away as soon as possible Minetti had returned He smashed all the figures of her in the studio He started feverishly working on a new subject Hello You don't appear to care for it,Christine It's a pity Because it's going to be my masterpiece And then you never were not much a judge of art,were you? Nor of anything else,what's that matter An very silly girl And very filly girl indeed It must be just a co-incidence But Charles,don't you see,it can't possible be a co-incidence,it is me A horrible character showed of me, every detail and linen and everything He must have seen us and this is his way of killing,but he knows Yes I He'll do something awful to me, I know he will,the way he looks at me Oh,Charles,take me away We'll leave tonight But must be careful There is one or two things I must do first now listen what you must do, go back as nothing -No,not that Charles -Now seriously be reasonable We must be careful We must have said nothing I want us to be well on our way out of Paris before he even misses you I suppose you are right Go back,get the best of your things together When he goes out for his evening drink slip out and meet me in the Gare du Nord at six and let me take this There's a train that's go back 615 and 620 I leave you there with my mother She'll take care of you And then in a few days we'll leave for the South I wish we could go now Dearest,do trust me There's so many things to do there's passports,money,remember we are going away for good and leaving no trace Very well,Gare du Nord at six -Under the clock -Under the clock Don't you be late Monsieur I couldn't make it out So thinking that something gone wrong with our plans I decided to wait in the Impasse in case she slipped down later I spent a useless and miserable night When morning came I returned home Later I went to Minetti's studio Oh,Charles,how nice of you to have called,come in,come in -Is Christine well? -Oh,yes,only a passing headache,you know But sit down,dear chap she's around somewhere, would love to see you you don't mind if I go on working,do you? Oh,not at all What are you doing? A symbolic subject The pipes of pear I call it Haven't made Pan very attractive,have you? My dear fellow,you've missed the subtlety of the thing When real life seldom is,is it? No I suppose it isn't Do you go to the exhibition of Carnot? No, I keep myself very much to myself these days Will Christine be long do you think? My dear chap,forgive me,a shocking ?? -A glass of wine? -Thanks You know I'm really very grateful to you Charles You've given up so much of your time to the dear girl So she tells me -Ah,good morning,Maria -Good morning,Monsieur Please stay below But Monsieur I will attend to it later Later? Always later But I brought you up some coal Thank you It's nearly empty You have burnt a lot The coal man comes today, shall I get you some? Yes,yes,anything the usual Tina didn't arrive so I made an excuse and left I was sure there was something sinister behind Minetti's behaviour So I hang around the Impasse waiting for her to return I waited most of the day She never appeared Then I got really alarmed and made enquiries in all the places she might have gone And no one had seen her Several days passed And I could not find no trace of her Finally I was foolish enough to go to the police I'm afraid it's hardly a matter for the police,Monsieur If what you say is true and this woman has disappeared surely her husband would have come to us She is a married woman,no I'm sorry There is nothing we can do I didn't no which way to turn I finally decided to go to Minetti and make a clean breast of the whole thing Tell him Tina and I loved each other and ask for her release I must go to the girl There is nothing you can do,Monsieur Now if you don't go away I shall be forced to arrest you What happened,Madame? He's murdered her,that's what happened -What are you saying? -Hear,leave me alone You're as mad as he was Tina I seemed to die in that moment I'd became demented I felt I had to see her again That night I went to the morgue Monsieur May I see the body of Madame Minetti? Come in,Monsieur,come in See the other three gentlemen came to see me the floor is hard and he spent a quite a while here Sit down You have made me something, Monsieur,won't you? I was just popping out to supper when Monsieur rang and I thought,it was another customer but I am glad I am glad in seeing you I have so sense for anyone who can talk,and I love to talk Some wine? Don't worry,Naughte is a very good wine,excellent wine and you must try the cheese too I've got a lovely delicious cheese, I bought it fresh this morning Keeps so well in here, you know,I keep it here Under this lap -But I came to see -Of course Yes,Monsieur,what a shocking cause It comes of being so much alone,you know Minetti? Oh yes I remember Madame Minetti she She kept an ?? in Rue de Frere, a very good wine she used to sell Very. But that was before your time,let me see It was I want to see the girl who was murdered in the Impasse Oh,that one,certainly,I put her over there by the window It's the best place you know,I always put the pretty one by the window I'm sorry you don't want to have some cheese But come on,Monsieur I,I'll show you A very sad case,Monsieur Very sad,indeed A beautiful face Don't you think,Monsieur? It's a bit bruises around the throat show up so much Apart from that a perfect specimen I don't get many perfect specimen these days,you see The last time I.. Don't you feel well,Monsieur? This is not Madame Minetti Let me out of here I'm so sorry,Monsieur Don't you want to stay and talk with me? People so seldom talk these days and I love to talk It was the woman I've seen with Minetti's at the village cafe A very terrible story Yes but that's not the end I redoubled my efforts to find Tina I advertised I combed Paris, I could find no trace of her She'd completely vanished Now the police made enquiries Fruitless enquiries And all the time I couldn't help thinking if I only hadn't made her go back that night I can't get it out of my mind I imagined that she might have lost her memory She was wandering around the country So when the studio was sold out Knowing it the only home she knew I took it,lock, stock, and barrel Nothing has been touched Her clothes is still there in the bedroom Everything is just as she left There was nothing more I could do I tried to keep my mind out of the horror of it all I went back to my work But without much success Hello,Jo-Jo,what are you doing this side of the river? Well, as Mohammed wouldn't come to the mountain the mountain had to come to Mohammed Why have you deserted me? -I've been working too hard -Working too hard These if there was anything good,that's not an excuse for deserting your friends You come here to insult me? My dear boy do you think I climb 15 flight of those stairs merely for the pleasure of insulting you? No,I brought you the sweetest loveliest girl who wants to meet you Heavens know why Now Lucille,this is Charles Garrie Charles Garrie,Lucille Lindbeck How do you do,Mademoiselle I saw you at Jo-Jo's party some months ago You model,Mademoiselle? Surely you must know that Lucille Lindbeck is the most famous model of our quarter You ought to feel very flattered that she's come to your studio -Why? When Gaston Claire.. -Perhaps,Monsieur has already a model I've been working without one Up till now I preferred my own company You mean you'll model for me? Really,Charles,what do you think she's come for,you idiot? You might stand in the portal light Take your hat off A little more to the left,please More? Thank you It was really she who kept me for losing my reason A charming patience with me did much to restore my piece of mind Constantly but all this in shadow of Tina came between us What's the matter? Don't you like it,dear? It's lovely Charles,what come over you? I haven't done anything,have I? It's not you,darling What has happened? I know it wasn't she It was the voice of Tina which kept hammering in my brain telling me to come back This feeling of Tina's presence grew so strong that I found myself impaled come and work in the studio where she has lived The more I worked here the stronger grew the conviction that one day she would return Some day she will return I know it My dear friend,I do not want to seem unkind But it is not far more likely that she is dead It's now more than a year Put beside all these morbid thoughts Go away from here Marry Lucille She adores you and would make you an excellent wife You still don't understand With this shadow hanging over me what can I do? I can't ask Lucille to share this horror with me Can't you see until I know I have no future? Solution is here Here in this room I feel it I know it One day alive or dead She will come back That where madness lie These morbid thoughts naturally only is encouraged by these unnatural surroundings I tell you get out of here Go away with Lucille and these imaginings will cease That's just did,it's not imaginations, things happen in this room Strange inexplicable things,not only me, other people have heard them too What sort of things? The organ plays,Maria has heard it These things are naturally very simply explained You've got an organ in this room, someone must been playing it Impossible,it doesn't work Then these noises are probably not the organ but water pipes,wind,echoes,many things could sound like an organ That's not all Something much more strange than that Do you see this lamp? Well,every night at eleven o'clock This lamp begins to flicker It burns slower,then goes out Can be many reasons for that Lack of oil, a draft,faulty burner and coincidence Don't you think I haven't though of all that I shielded it,changed the oil, put in new wicks But still at eleven it goes out You think I'm going mad maybe By living too long in these morbid surroundings you begin to hear and feel things that do not exist Do you think I'm having delusions? I see If you saw for yourself would you believe it then? That's it,come back here tonight and see for yourself And you'll know that I am not going mad Will you come,Ivan? Yes I come but on one condition that you came and have a good dinner before That's a bargain Heavens,this place look bad enough by daylight but now you certainly provide it the right setting to make me believe anything Like the lamp When did you say this phenomena occurs? Exactly at 11 pm Still a few minutes to go You know,Charles I'm not at all sure That I'm doing the right thing and encouraging you in this nonsense Wait,you'll see I'm glad the stove kept in,some cold night Are there any other studios in this building occupied? No,they are empty What are you doing up here? I saw a light coming from you when I ordered the hall so I came up to see that's my job,isn't it? Get out and don't come up here again No wait a minute,Madame I've something to ask you I'll talk to you but not to him Monsieur Charles tells me that you are hearing organ music here in this room Yes,I do I hear it all times And not a soul in the studio,mind you Is there anything particular about this music,can you describe it? You know the tune Yes,can you tell us the tune Cruel against an old woman I've no learning of music Can you hum it or sing it? I'm no singer either But not that when I was a young girl On the tune That's it Charles are you sure someone is not trying to have some joke on you? Well,anybody who could possibly be interested in scaring you out of here? What do you mean? Let's have a look at the organ Very strange The lamp,now you'll see -There's a body on your -Stop it Fool,screaming like that because the lamp goes out Now do you believe me? Well? The possibility is there Violent deeds,violent emotions can leave an impression on a room or an object Something has made such an impression on this room Some power concentrated some object But where is that power? I have it We must have a seance here Here in this room,and the power is at its highest That way,and that way only can we solve the mystery A medium is a living bridge across which this spirit there is beyond powerful to this one -If Tina is dead I shall see her -That is possible No,I don't like it There is danger I admit But only to the medium If one of experience is brave I know the very woman let's try tomorrow Don't let us do this,Ivan I have a presentiment that something terrible will happen Leave it to me The whole affair puzzles me deeply And I am sorry now I took it on But why? I like Charles Garrie And as I told you I feel I have some responsibility with that girl Lucille Does she come into the story? Not yet but Unless Charles Garrie is a remarkably fine actor he is in a highly neurotic condition Besides a psychic element has now come into it Now what do you mean? Spooks,ghosts,the supernatural This is ridiculous Not so ridiculous as you may suppose Our senses have their limits,very limit But are we to seriously believe that nothing exist beyond the limit of our senses Anyhow Charles believes he has experienced supernatural And that belief I propose to exploit to our advantage How? By holding a seance in his studio In fact I have already arranged But you don't seriously believe What I may believe or not believe does not enter into it Because in this case a result of the seance has been prearranged -Ah,fake medium -Certainly not Madame Kadowa is a medium,a very famous one But in this case she has agreed to help me Well,I am still utterly in the dark Well,I believe it'll be my explicit What Madame said,and I suppose ??,in Garrie's state of mind I hope to trap him into revealing the whole truth Highly indigenous but suppose we fail Then no harm has been done and in any case we maybe backing up the wrong tree Near to hold your nose There is that possibility There is another possibility,my friend There are more things in heaven and earth,remember? What help do you need? Two men in the building tonight Light more candles,quick What have you done, Madame,everything is spoilt I must leave the place Somebody tried to kill me I am suffocated let me go,let me go -I got to get out of here -Will you pull together,Madame Let me go,let me go What things haven't ? happened, you knew what you had to do Don't you know? Didn't you feel the presence I never had such experience before Evil,evil Nothing will induce him to ? at his heart,nothing You mean there is something here?
