Another glorious morning. It's a good surfing day. Just put on your sunscreen and head off. Isn't it good to be alive? Thanks, mate. - Just put it here? - Yeah, cool. Mate, I'm in deep shit. Well, that's unusual. Look, you know that car Pete got me, it's still hot. I need to flog it quick. So talk to Pete. He'll move it. I can't. I still owe him a hundred grand off the last job. That's why I'm asking you. Rick, I haven't got a hundred grand. I'm gonna be straight up, you're causing me grief with my girl. And how many times do you need to hear I've got a fucking job? I've given that game away. One favor. That's all I'm asking. Pete treats you like a son. We can go and see him together, talk to him. Give me time to repay the debt and then I'm out of your life. Deal? You mean you're conning me into this? So if I support you on this one, you leave me alone. Okay? Well, fuck it, Sean. I'll owe you one. So tomorrow night, 'round seven, I'll pick you up, we'll go and see Pete together. Okay? - Hey. - Hey. I'll see you in five. - Okay. - Hmm. Well, seriously, how does he do that? Practice and dedication. Didn't you ever want to surf like your friends? I tried. Life kept getting in the way. You were there when Sean's dad was murdered. Still have flashbacks about it. And Robbie, well, he just closed down. They were very close and, after it happened, he just left town and I didn't see him for years. And what about Sean? Sean. Imagine having to grow up in orphanages, your father murdered, deserted by your Mum. I worry about him, and Jack tells me he's easily influenced and hangs out with the wrong sort. That's why I think you're good for him. He'll come around. Yeah... Yeah, he will. Oh, wow. I mean, it's just-- it's so graceful, you know? I call it liquid ballet. "Liquid ballet." Nice. This is-- this is just a block of wood. No, but look at that. It's the real deal. - It's a real table. - We used to ride this. Hey, hey. It's so good to see the Dads enjoying themselves. Mm. I've gotta get to work. I'll see you at the club. See you there. See you, Katie. I heard about that. That was brilliant. Hey, boys. G'day, mate, hey. I had one just like that. - Yeah? - Yeah. Until a rock jumped out at Burleigh and ate it. Yeah, it's true. Sounds like you, Dad. Memories, eh? Clay. What up, Pops? Hey, mate. - Digging the vibe. - You know what? Boo would've absolutely loved this museum. Thirty years, right, since he was murdered? Seriously? I'll wait for you guys outside. Hang on, mate. We'll come with you. You guys see that? Those old boys must really miss their mate. We could do a tribute, Sean, for your Dad. - It's not a bad idea. - Yeah? Yeah, yeah, we can do that. You okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm great. Hey, um... I forgot to ask, how was work today? - Oh, it was okay. It's fine. - Oh, okay. What were you and Rick talking about at the club? Well, he wants me to go and see Pete. You know I owe him aft-- after Dad died. And? Rick will drag you down. I saw the way that you didn't want anything to do with him at the club. You've got to trust that. We're so good now. You're so good now. I'm really proud of you. Really? Yeah. Really. Mm. Um... Clay and the other guys, they-- they want me to go on a-- a tribute trip to Austinville to honor my Dad. You should do it. - Yeah. I'd love to come. - Yeah? They mentioned it's just the sons. But I promise when I come back, I... am gonna take you... somewhere special. Just here, with you. - Yep. - Hey, Jack. We decided to do a tribute run to Austinville in memory of Sean's Dad. - You in? - I'll pass. Let's twist it. If it was you, he'd be there for your Dad. Trust me on this. I'll owe you. Yeah, leave it with me. So tomorrow at the cave? Early? Done deal. We'll see you there. - Hey, mate, how are you? - Good, mate. Good, mate. - Had good waves lately? - Uh, it's getting better. Let's, uh, let's go inside. All right, Pete, you know why I called. Rick needs a favor. You know Dominic Cooper? Yeah, we've done business. Well, I happen to know he has got a tidy little shipment coming in by sea. Well, no surprises there, but what's that got to do with me? Well, I owe you, don't I? This will take care of it. Plus you both know I really need the cash. - Pete, you understand? - Oh, you bet I do. So when are you gonna fix me up? Well, that's what I'm saying. Borrow the shipment, get you your cash, get Sean his cut and I get those other assholes off my back. So you're saying you're gonna knock off this shipment to repay your debts? Mine included? Great. Everybody happy. Hang on. This sounds fucking dangerous. Come on, mate. You're going soft. Look, all I'm saying is, we'll go and check it out. If it looks too heavy, we'll cancel. But Sean, I'm telling you, mate, this is the only way you and I get out ahead. I promised Katie no more shit. Yeah, I get it, kid. Your call. Look, if it's a no, I'll accept, but if it's a go show, mate, you're gonna need an alibi. Well, that's not an issue. Sean's got his surfing mates. Great! So when the shipment comes in, I'll go check it out and then we'll decide. Okay? Come on, mate. Last one, for me, promise. Good evening, all you freeloaders. I'm just kidding, folks. I'd like to thank each and every one of you for coming to my home tonight. My gorgeous niece, April, has decided to marry Tim and Tim has committed to spend the rest of his life with April and I'll make sure that he'll do that. So look, let's all raise a toast to the happy couple. Cheers! Katie! Katie, come and join me. April mentioned that you might be looking for, uh, work? Oh, I was, yeah, but I've got a good gig now at the surf club. Did she mentioned to you that I've got loan shops all over the place, and a lot of people are looking for a loan and I'm always looking for staff... Managers. Here... So, give me a call. You know what? I'm thinking that maybe you and I, you know, later, we could get together, talk about you and your future plans, and, uh, what do you say? Over-over a nightcap? Mm. I have a very big day surf club-wise, but, um, maybe some other time. - I got to take that. - Mm. Yeah. Talk to me. I'm gonna go. Bye. Okay, thanks. Call me. Dom. We're lucky that car flies. We? So this was some easy-peasy boost, was it? Just drop me at Kane's house. Kane, I'm out the front. Have you-have you got a sec? What, what time is it? Just give me a minute. Mate, I'm in trouble. For fuck's sake, Sean. What happened? Rick. He was in debt and he owed Pete and I helped out. I need an alibi. I thought you wiped that shonky bastard. I did, but Pete asked me to help one last time. I owe him. We boosted a drug shipment. Fuck. Yeah, it gets worse. Katie. If she finds out, she's going to walk. Yeah, man, I like Katie. She's a keeper. Yeah, she really is the best thing that ever happened to me. That life that I used to live, it's finished. I did this for Pete as one last job. He looked after me for years. Rick conned me again. Mate... can I stay here on your couch just for tonight? Yeah, yeah. Sure, mate. I'll-- I'll just get a rug. Frank, what's up? - I've got a lead. - Well? That chick you were talking to at the party, - she definitely knows something. - Crap. You tell me you found that mother who's ripped me off. Stay with me on this. I need more info on the chick-- name, address, who she knows, where she works. She works at the surf club. You can get the information from them, and I'm warning you, Frank. You better find my drugs. Or what? Piece of shit. Coming. Morning, Sean. A car was stolen from Varsity Lakes and the camera scans show a distinct likeness to you, same build and size, and with your record, we thought we'd come and check it out. Where were you on the 15th at 9:00 PM? Well, I was with a mate. And he or she can confirm that? Of course. You gonna give me a name? Do you not believe me or something? Come on, Sean, I've got a camera likeness. I can hold you on suspicion and you know that. Maybe it's best you just come down to the station. We can check your alibi from there. All right. I'm just gonna tell my girl first. You can make that call from the station. - Okay. - Let's go. Lauren, um, listen, Sean's in trouble again. Katie! God, what this time? Can you do me a big, big favor and use those legal skills of yours? Okay. Don't worry. I'm on it. I'll let you know when it's done. Thank you. Hey, mate, where's Kane? Work. He's behind on boards to shape. Look, man, the trip? I might have to work. Look, with Sean, you know the drill. We just-- we don't hit it off. He's got his demons. It's his MO, always in the shit. Trip's still on, Jack. Come on, mate. Hit the waves. Time out with your mates. Bit of history for our Dads. Been too darn long. Just give me some time. Your call, Jack. Yeah, I'll let you know. Okay. Bye, bye. He's all yours. So, Sean. Sean, don't walk away from me. - Look, it's fine. It was nothing. - This is not nothing. You're lucky I know that detective. Your alibi is paper thin. Well, it's gonna hold. I know you've been hanging with your old crew and I really don't care, but I care about Katie, and you should too. I care. You're up to your neck in this shit. There's gonna be consequences. Well, I can look after myself, all right? Do you ever care about anyone other than yourself? Look, Katie means the world to me. I would do anything for her. Hmm. Thank you. This is the last time I bail you out, Sean. The last time. - Lauren. - Katie, I got him out. Lauren, I don't know how to thank you. I've got your back, sister. - I owe you. - I'll add it to the tab. Bye. Oh, hey! Do you ever check your phone, Kane? Oh, shit. Margo Robbie again. - She must be after her new board. - Yeah. You wish. Sorry, guys. I've been a bit behind on orders. - Ready to rock and roll? - Yeah. Wow. What's the story? Set it up on the weekend. Tribute to our Dads back in the day. Check out the boards. Oh, look at Boo. Dad reckons he loved that board. Oh, and Scollop! The girls loved him. Still do. So, guys... you're committed to this road trip with the tribute board? - Leaving tomorrow, right? - Right. You finish that board in time, - I guarantee Margo will be on a plane. Sean will be out by then. Mistaken identity. Catching up with him tomorrow. - We'll leave you to it. - All right. - He'll come 'round. Catch you later. - See you. - So you're not saying no to the trip? - Clay. Okay. Okay. - Hey, beautiful. - Hey. What's up, love? So there's nothing to it, right? - What? - With the police? Oh, no. Kane confirmed I was at his place all night. It's just mistaken identity, that's all. What? Someone broke into your place after you left and I was really scared. - I was hiding. - Did you see them? Mm, not really. Well, do you know who they were? - No. - Did they take anything? How would I know? Fuck! I can't do this. What? This, us. You're lying to me. I need you to be honest with me. I really do. Katie! Fuck! What kept you? I'm here, aren't I? How long you been out? I'm looking for someone. - You know them? - Should I? Have a closer look. Don't know them offhand. Is this about surfies dealing drugs? Could be. Keep your ears open. I can check it out. Find out what's going down, if you want. Yeah, I want. Okay. When I've got the information, where you gonna be? Don't worry, I'll find you. Go on, Kane. Kane. Hey, Kane. Hey. - Sean. - What happened? - Massive wipe out. - His head hit the reef. His dad's not taking it well. He just left. - Can I see him? - Yeah. In here. He lost a lot of blood. I should have been there for him. He could have died. He mumbled something about you. He mentioned my name. Are you sure? He said he was sorry. Sorry? About what? Letting you down. How? I don't get it. Maybe he was bummed he couldn't come on the trip with us. Yeah. I love you, mate. That board you built for my Dad, it's gonna be safe with us. Hang in there. Pretty busy here, mate. Who the fuck are you? What do you want? Tell me who this is. No fucking idea. I'd try a little bit harder if I were you, buddy. Have you got an answer? Huh? Fuck you! Last chance. Fuck you. Hey, Lauren. Um, there's something I-- Look, I have to apologize. You do? To who? You. - Why? - I was wrong about Sean. I didn't get why you wanted to date a bad boy like that. He was so polite and nice, and I know I did just save his ass, but it was something different. He was thankful. I see why you like him, and everyone has two sides, right? And left. I'm apologizing to you and you're making fun. No, I'm not. I promise I'm not. So what did you want to tell me? Nothing. Yeah, it doesn't-- it doesn't really matter. I'm so glad you changed your mind. Sometimes we do what we need to. Hello? Sean, you there? Rick, you prick! I told you never to call me again. Mate. Look, things are getting outta hand. Katie said someone broke in. Is this related? Maybe. - Mate, we need to get away. - We? What we? I told you, I fucking warned you. Now if anything happens to Katie, you are gone. Do you understand? Mate, if they come for me, I'm giving them you. - Got that? - Piss off. Want a ride? Come on, Sean, get in. - You guys have my board? - On top. Come on, let's go. - Tone, do you have a minute? - Sure. What's up? Um, I wouldn't usually ask at such late notice, but if I could take a few days off, I would really appreciate it. You know, we've got a couple of big parties this week. Yeah. Um, yeah, it's personal. Okay. I'll get someone to cover for you. Thank you. Okay, cool. So wedding's off, huh? Probably. I messed things up with her again. She'll hang in there, Sean, dead set. She loves you. - We're good? - Yeah. Happy days. All right. Get in this. Woo. Yeah, that was a good one. - Hey, Sean, are you joining us? - Yeah. Hey, guess what, boys? My shout. What's the plan, Stan? Just keeping the vibe alive. I mean, Sean, I'm sure you'll make it a weekend we won't forget. You having a go at me? - Because maybe I will make it a weekend you won't forget. - Yeah? Hey, hey, hey, hey! It's cool, champ. Hey, um, while you're up, why don't you check out the van? I think there's something in the back there you might dig. - Come on, man. - That was him. Just lay off, will you? Wow. This is a replica of Dad's board. All right, guys, I, um... Yeah, I forgot about this, and I don't really know what to say. Thanks to Kane and thank you, you guys. This, um... Yeah, it really means a lot to me. Hey, man, it's all good. Now grab yourself a beer. - You too, Jack. - Thanks, guys. Happy days. - Any news? - Yeah, I'm making progress. Uh, they wanted you to sign these papers for the insurance on the Mustang. That is not news. Where are my drugs? I told you, boss, I've got a good solid lead on some surfie bozos. More bullshit! You're stalling me, Frank. I know you. Hey, careful, boss. I am trying my best here. Did you say careful? You come to me with a little bit of fucking lead about some fucking surfies and that's it? Oh, you're getting old, Frank, and you are way past your use by date. I think it's you that's past your use by date. You found me. - You got something for me? - Yeah. Well? Cost of living's going up all the time, Frank. So is the cost of dying. You know what? Fuck it. Why don't you talk to that scumbag, Rick Molet? He owes everybody, including me. Well, now we're talking. So where do I find this, uh, scumbag Molet? As I said, cost of living's goin'-- - Frank. - Where is he? He lives up Austinville somewhere. Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank! And in other news, police have discovered the body of a man identified as Pete Enfield at his property. At this stage, police are investigating and believe the murder of Enfield may be related to criminal activities. Stop the car. Stop the car now! It's my fault. Couldn't help him, Sean. You had nothing to do with it. He was my best pal. - We should go home. - You're wrong, mate. If we go back now, we'll fuck things up completely for Sean. Who knows what he'll do? It's for our Dads, remember? - Okay. - Come on. Memories, eh? Remember that gig? The one where you met your first girlfriend? Yeah. Until she ran off with that guitarist from Acca Dacca. Acca Dacca. This dude lost his girl to a pensioner. Okay. What did he do, take her back to his nursing home? All right, enough. Jesus. You coming out, mate? You okay? Yeah. I'm just gonna go catch up with a mate. So I'll see you boys later. Let's do this. You know, I reckon Sean's still on the gear. No way. He's off that stuff. What about that shit with Pete? What did he mean? "It's my fault"? - He's hiding something. - We're all hiding something. Oh, good. You got my message. - Pete's dead. - I know. What, that's it? Pete was like a father to me, Rick. Because of you, he's gone. Shit happens, okay? I did try and warn you, mate. No, no. You didn't warn me about anything, but I don't give a fuck anymore. You conned me into this. I own that. What happened, happened. The only reason I am here is to say return it before it's too late. Sean... Sean! I already did that. That's why I messaged you. I don't have the stash anymore. Stop lying! They broke into my apartment! They killed Pete. They want their drugs and they're coming for you. And you! Look... I can help you if you return it. That's it. No more. Just go. Go! You're a dead man. Hey. Nice waves out there. It's like this most mornings. Glassy, south-easterly. Haven't seen you around here before. Oh, camping. Nice shooter. I'm Jack, by the way. I'm Michelle. My folks run the op shop. Cool. Yeah, yeah I know the place, I think. Um, near the surf store, right? - Yeah. That's it. - Yeah. So you up for it? You bet. Okay, Mick Fanning. Let's go. Hey, Michelle! Hey, um, look, I just wanted to say that you were amazing. All the boys say that. - Um, maybe we could-- - Catch you same time tomorrow? Yeah. This must have been what it was like - for the old boys when they were up here. - Yep. Surfer's dream. - Sean didn't come back yet? - He is here now. Sean. - It's Katie, right? - Yeah. Yeah. I let everyone down, especially Katie. No, that's not right. You've always been straight with me, and whatever's happening with Katie, you'll work it out. You love her and she loves you. - You think? - I know. Well, you're wrong, mate. See you boys in the morning. Ahem. - I didn't think you'd show. - And miss this? Big night? Ah, few beers. Do I really look that shabby? Stop fishing for compliments. - So are we gonna do this? - You bet. Hey, would you like to catch up for a drink? I've got work. Sorry. Maybe after work? You're on. Okay. Pick me up at the op shop. - Seven. - Sure. Who is it? Is that you, Sean? Do I know you? Mate, what do you want? You have something that belongs to me. Where is it? Why don't we talk this over? Whiskey? Mate, I don't have your stuff. Lying is bad for your health. I'm not lying, honest. The drugs. Where are they? I'm asking you a question. Sean. Sean's got your stuff. Sean's full name? Sean Bindaboo. This guy? Yes, mate. So where's Sean? Look, he's around town somewhere. That's all I know. Okay? Excuse me, ma'am. I'm, uh... just a little bit lost here, and I was wondering if you could show me the way to, um-- What are you doing? What are you doing? Be still, calm down, calm down. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? - You understand? - Yeah. Now when I take my hand away, if you scream, it's gonna be the last sound you hear, okay? Okay. Now get in. I know you. It was you at Sean's apartment. Maybe. You'd be dead now if I'd seen you. What do you want with me? You? Nothing. Does your boyfriend know you're here? It was meant to be a surprise. Oh, it certainly will be. He took something that belongs to me. Now he has a mobile, right? You wanna call him? Let's call him, come on. Call him. Katie? Sean. Katie, I was just texting you. Look, I fucked up. Sean. I, um, just listen. I'm sorry. It's just, I'm struggling here. - I, um-- - Seanie, Seanie, Seanie, that is so sweet. Who is this? It's your girlfriend's keeper. She's right here next to me. - Katie? - Sean. - Where are you? - What's going on? What have you done? Are you satisfied, asshole? Hm? I presume you do want your girl back. Please just-- just don't touch her. Listen, this is what I want. I want that package that your friend Rick Molet gave you. I don't have the drugs! - Sean, I don't want to hurt her. - Hey, hey. Look, please, please don't. Please don't hurt her. She's gonna be in a box next to you if you don't tell me where the drugs are. Rick stashed them. Okay? I'm gonna need time because they're a long way from here. How long? Let's say seven tonight. The wharf at Blue Bay. Seanie, I have your girl. Don't be late. Hey! They've got Katie! - Who's they? - They, the bastards that killed Pete. - You know who killed Pete? - Yeah. Look, I haven't been honest with you. Look, Rick and Pete, they got me to assist in a drug boost. I-- I thought you were done with that now that you're with Katie. I was with Katie, but she tossed me out. Fuck! I'm a fuckwit. I'm a complete fuckwit. I agreed to do one last job, it was just to repay debts... and now they've got Katie. They think that I've got the coke. To buy me time, I told them that I had it. You've really messed up, man. What can I do to help? What, you'd do that? You'd help me after everything I've done? Sure. We all make mistakes. Jack? I'm not buying it. Mate, you've gotta get your shit together. Yeah, I know, mate. After everything I've done, I don't deserve your support, but I sure as hell appreciate it. So what's the plan? What, sell the stash and split it three ways? I'm just kidding! Can't believe you fell for that. You take dumb one to a whole new level. Of course I'm gonna help, we're mates. Like Clay said, we all fuck up. You know what? At least you've owned it. I'm sorry, man, I shouldn't have turned my back on you. Thank you. I really don't deserve you guys. - It's Katie you don't deserve. - Well, that's true. Now we've got to save her. So how are we gonna do this? We're gonna need a few things and a Navy travel bag. I know just the place. Give me five. - Well, hi. You're here early. - What? Oh! You haven't come to cancel on me, have you? No, no, no, no. I, um... Wait, what's up? Michelle? You sure you still want in on this? It could be dangerous. I'll be okay. So why did we choose the Blue Bay spot for the exchange? I remember the old wharf from years ago. It's usually deserted. So what's the plan, Stan? The deal is I go in, I hand over the bag and I get Katie out of there. And you trust them? No. You lot feel like a paddle? Come. Your boyfriend's late. How are we gonna do this? Keep coming. Turn the torch off. We okay to exchange? Easy. Easy. Let's take it easy. Come down here. Just take it easy. Move back. Drop the torch. Open the bag. Drop it. Hand her over first. Drop the bag. Move back. Back it up. - Hey, look. - They've started without us. No! I'm gonna go help Katie. Hey, are you okay? Shit. - Help. - Sean! There's Sean! - Sean. - Sean! - Come on, get on the board. - Sean. Oh, God. - Hey, hey. - You're okay. You're okay. I am sorry, so sorry. - Yeah. - Are you okay? I am okay, yeah. It's okay G'day, sweetheart. My name's, uh, Boo. Dad! Ho, ho, ho. Hey, Dad. No way you're starting without me. Hey, Kane, you made it. This tribute is for my Dad, affectionately known as Boo. Summer City was his turf. He knew how to have a good time... how to ride a decent wave. Most importantly, he respected the love that you Dads and friends had for him. Like all of us, he wasn't perfect. I'm still proud to be called this son.
