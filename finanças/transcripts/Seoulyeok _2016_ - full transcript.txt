I don't even have money for the internet café. Always the internet café and shit. I told you, I won't do it anymore. - Then what? - Then what, what? Should we sleep under the stars then? Then go to the station, and ask the homeless if you can join the family, they'll keep you warm. You said you were getting a part-time job, no? Even if I work all month, it's never enough for the rent! Because you're always at the internet café. Hye-sun, let's just get through this month. Always "this month" and shit! You don't have to screw 'em, just steal their money while they're taking a shower. Then it's game over! Stop spewing bullshit! I'll find a decent job next month, OK? Exactly how?
