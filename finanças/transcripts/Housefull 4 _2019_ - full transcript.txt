Mom, dad. Why do I keep getting the same dream over and over again? It's been haunting me for years now. I don't understand. What are you saying, man? We're going to make money off a barber? No, no, bro. Harry is London's Mr Forgetful. - Mr Forgetful. - Whenever he hears a loud sound... Like bang, thud, bam. It puts pressure on the vein in his ear. And he forgets everything for a minute. Come, come, let's have some fun. What's up, Harry? Give him a makeover, will you. Woah... Ugly, isn't it Come... Come... Come... Come. Where's the spray? Why are you spitting?! Are you crazy, use the spray. Thank you. - Yes. - Nice one, man. - How much, Harry? - 5 pounds. But Harry, I've only got 20. - I'll give you change. - Here. - Here. - Thank you. Yes? I gave you 20 pounds. You owe me 15 back. - You gave me 20 pounds? - Yeah... - So I have to give you 15 pounds back. - Yeah. Thank you. Yes? You owe me 15 pounds. Thank you. 15 pounds... 15 pounds... Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - Hey... wait. - We have enough change now. Thank you. Thank you. - See you, Harry. - Come again. What a loser. - We're rich, you poor guy! We're rich. - Yeah... That absent-minded loser. Today I'm on a fast... ...that's why my punch was slow. How dare you take advantage of Harry's condition? Return my brother's money. Sorry, Max. Sorry. We'll never do it again. - Sorry. - Sorry Bro. Sorry, Max. Where did my money go? Max... - Those two boys came in here... - And took your money. Shit... Fantastic. I didn't even realize. 25..35.. Because of your forgetfulness ... ...we're already in a lot of trouble with Big Bhai. When will you learn? Hey, lower your volume. Look who's talking. You're going to forget everything anyway. - Stay in your limits. - Shut up. - I'll punch you in the face. - Hey... Hey...my brothers, Max, Harry. You two are at it again. If you two are going to fight, and quarrel... ...then I'm going to blow my cool too. You're doing it again. Talking like a female. There's no point correcting him. He forgot to tick the gender box. It happens. Correction...shit happens. Correct. Guys, smile please. Big Bhai's here. London is known for two things. Big Ben and Big Bhai. And now for the real question... Did you guys arrange for Michael Bhai's 5 million pounds? Did you? - We didn't. - You didn't. Speak up. - We asked Yes Bank for a loan. - Okay. But Yes Bank said No. - They said no, dear brother. - I see... - That's all... - That's all...! Sir, sir, not my pinky...not my pinky. - That's all isn't it... - It was a mistake. No son, you're the mistake. Remember! The Police are after me. Take this. This contains Michael Bhai's 5 million pounds. I'll collect it later. Keep it safe. Michael Bhai's 5 million pounds Keep it safe. Michael Bhai's 5 million pounds Keep it safe. Check if the Police are still out there. Police! Michael Bhai's dirty laundry. Wash it carefully. I found money in Michael Bhai's trousers. Actually, we've got a plan to pay you back. - I see... - Let me explain. But, please take a seat first. - Come, come. - Fine, fine, I'll sit down. Harry, make Big Bhai look like a heroine. - Hero. - Yeah... Hero. Hey... Big Bhai, shall I trim your hair? No, make them grow longer. At least this tall. Please, spare him the sarcasm. No sarcasm. What sarcasm? Do you have any idea how many times you guys have made... ...my blood boil? Shave their heads! - Hey useless? - Yes brother? Are you done? You're ready. Then show me the mirror. There's the mirror. Show me the back. Here you go. Stop spinning me around and show me the back. Take a good look. Look... Did you actually make my hair grow longer? Yes, sir. I used an extension on the front and back. Ok..enough of all this. Let's get back to the point. What plan have you made to return Michael Bhai's money? Speak up. Sir, meet our family planner. Go on, tell him what the plan is. Speak up. You've heard of London's tycoon Thakral, right? We're dating his three daughters. And once we marry them... ...forget 5 million, we'll pay you 10 million instead. - 10 million... - 10 million! Hey Missy...stay in your limits, understand. - Yes, sir. - And you come here. Why would those billionaire girls marry useless people like you? Because we have already made them fall in love with us.. We'll marry them in a couple of months. Michael won't give you more than one day... ...and here you are asking for a couple of months. Nonsense. Then what should we do, Big Bhai? I've got an idea. Hey missy, listen carefully. This one's completely original, a new plan. I...will flirt with the girls. And you will save them. You call that original? Of course it's original! Yes, it's original. - Original. - Original. Hey, babies. Beautiful. I wanted to ask you a question. Do you know what number Newton invented? Come on, it's simple. Do you know what number Newton invented? The kissing number? Yes... Give me a kiss... Today is World Kiss day. So I deserve some kisses. Come on, babies. Let's make some babies. Give me a kiss, ladies... ...and Big Bhai's all yours. You said that they are very well mannered girls. Save me from them. Hospital, ICU, Morgue, take me anywhere. But save me from these girls. Wait a second. That means.. you know this guy? I see... So, this was your plan all along? Why did you do all this? We wanted to impress you girls and propose to you. Yes. And we wanted to ask you a question... What? What number did Newton invent? You're dead meat. You're all dead meat. You're all going to get beaten up! It's going to be very painful. Foolish. What number did Newton invent? The kissing number! Can we get one kiss...? No way! Idiot. Oh my God! I got a kiss from the queen! Guys, please be on your best behaviour, okay. You should look as civilised, decent, and cultured as our dad. Beauty. Beauty. Beauty. Papa... Daughter. Daughter. Daughter. - Papa. - Come my, darlings. Papa, these are the boys that we told you about. Papa, Max and Harry are both born and brought up in London, this is Max. - This is Harry. - And this is Roy. - Papa, we wanted you to... - No. Boys talk only. I've bought new horses for you. Go and check them out. But papa, can we stay here too... Like I said. Go. Okay. Okay. Good luck. Thank you. So, Mr. Astronaut. You three should be ashamed of yourselves. Horsing around with girls who are half your age. What's wrong? Why are all the horses coming this way? Run! Run! Kriti! Papa! Roy! Come quickly! Neha! Thank you. - Kriti. - Harry. Kriti. Are you okay? Harry... You were jumping from one horse to another... How did you do that? Actually, I was... I don't know. My children. Papa. Are you okay? Is everything okay? Yeah, papa. Oh, God. I will never find more deserving and able sons-in-law. Boys, turn on. Papa... I mean you're on, boys. You're on. Bring your mother over tomorrow. So this is your mother, who's amongst the heavens? Yes. "Spicy Mumma!" Look at that bird made out of gold. Hey... That's so wrong! Return my mother's photo. - You'll tear it son. - Give it back. Papa. Papa. Listen, this is not fair. - I will talk to him. - Papa... We've decided that the destination wedding will be in Italy. - When did we decide Italy? - I think it should be Ibiza. I said Vegas! We go Vegas every year! Oh no, not again. One minute. One minute. One minute. Listen to your father first. Please continue. As always, our ancestral globe will decide the destination. I will spin it. Wait a minute. Who owns this globe? Your father, So he will spin it. - Father, spin your globe... - Okay. - Ready. - Here we go. Sitamgarh?! What the hell is Sitamgarh? Sitamgarh sounds so boring. - I'm spinning it again. - Come on. Vegas. Vegas. Vegas. Come on, Ibiza. - Sitamgarh? Again? - What the hell. - Sitamgarh, Again? - What's going on? Wait. Wait. Wait. Vegas. I'll move it to Vegas. - Vegas. - Vegas. Sitamgarh. Does anyone even know where Sitamgarh is? I don't know. Behind the 3rd mountain of the Ujjain mountain ranges... ...situated on the banks of the Brahma Sagar river. Is a Kingdom, filled with history Our Sitamgarh. Sitamgarh. Harry. How do you know? Yeah, Harry. How do you know? I don't know. Actually, on second thoughts, it can be fun. I mean everyone goes to Italy and Ibiza. This can be adventurous. - What say? - Yeah. So a traditional Indian wedding. Exactly. Ok fine, if it's Sitamgarh, then so be it. Papa, our wedding will be in Sitamgarh. Congratulations! Baby, look at those peacocks! I'm so glad you shaved your beard. Why did you do it? I was looking elder than your father, that's why. YUCK! A pigeon's yuck brings good luck Come let's go Welcome to Hotel Sitamgarh Palace. Myself Winston Churchgate via Mumbai via London branch. The new damager. Pardon. The new manager of this magnanimous, monumental, majestic, masterpiece palace. Bell boy. Mamma Mia...I've told you so many times. Sticks and stones don't break my bones but carrying this load's a disaster. I'm joking. Luggage. King...Surya Singh Rana! - What? - You are the king of this kingdom! This is your kingdom! You're the king! The emperor. The Badshah. If I am Badshah, who are you Honey Singh? Mamma Mia... The King of classical dance, Master Bangdu. This is your reincarnation. You're right, I was born in this nation. No, reincarnation! Re... What? The great bodyguard Dharamputra! Aakhri Pasta. Oh my God!! He recognises me. - Idiot. - It's on your name tag. Prince Bala Dev Singh! My lord, my benefactor. And you even have hair on your head now! Take me under your refuge. I beg you. - Hey, come here. - This guy is crazy.. - You're standing on my hand! - Sorry. Sorry. Where are you taking me? Let go of me! I am not joking. - Everybody is reborn!! - He keeps talking rubbish. He has some mental problem. Sorry, sir. Please come. Please follow me. Please. "Until I don't behead every member of Sitamgarh's Royal family" "Time will change, and so will the Ruler" The black mountain tribe?! Pasta was right. Winston! Mr. Winston. Mr. Winston. Mr. Winston. I want Pasta. Most certainly. With red sauce or white sauce? No, not that pasta. The guy who works for you. Your bellboy. Where can I find him? He behaved atrociously in front of you dignitaries. - So I fired him. - Fired him? - But where can I find him? - Madhavgarh. Quite far from here. Can I borrow the hotel vehicle? Sure, sure... 1200 rupees per hour. Put it on my account. Account? How desi. Account. - Long live... - King Parikshitaap... - Long live... - King Parikshitaap... - Long live... - King Parikshitaap... - Long live... - King Parikshitaap... - Long live... - King Parikshitaap... - Long live... - King Parikshitaap... - Long live... - King Parikshitaap... Let the proceedings begin. Some of the local businessmen have a complaint. - Complaint? - Yes. - What did my son do this time? - Your Highness, my 5-year-old son... ...giggled at the sight of Prince Bala Dev Singh's bald head. And that made Prince Bala Dev furious. Shave their heads! Why did he do this, Your Highness? When Prince Bala was born, he had a lot of hair on his head... ...which is why I named him Bala. But at the age of 2, after the royal head shaving ceremony... ...his hair never grew back. Damn. He's been bald ever since. Unfortunately. Take a look, Your Highness. He didn't even spare my 5-year-old kid. He shaved his hair too. Bala! Have mercy on me, son. I'll feed you porridge. Feed me porridge? First, I'll feed you this arrow. Bala! Put it down. I said put it down. Put it down. Such cruelty against my subjects. If I hear another complaint against you... ...then I will banish you from this kingdom. Forgive me, father. Forgive me. I lost my mother when I was very young... ...and after the royal ceremony, I lost all my hair forever. I beg for your forgiveness. Please forgive me. Okay don't worry, son. Get up. I just saw them! Where are you entering?! In front of everyone?! Please forgive me. Come here. My good son. Son...love your subjects, and they will love you back. After all you'll be the king after me. When? I am just joking. My funny son. Very nice, son. I knew my son would reform some day. And today you have. Bravo. Come son, it's time for supper! After you, father. My noble son. You want to murder your own father?! You're banished! "Finally you get what you deserved." "Every body's abusing you." "We're going to celebrate." "Bring something to eat." "Finally you get what you deserved." "Everybody's abusing you." "We're going to celebrate." "Bring something to eat." Prince Bala has been washed down the royal drain. He lost the kingdom, the throne, everything Disperse. Disperse. Disperse. Curse you! - What's that in your hand? - It's a royal invitation. From the King of Sitamgarh, Surya Singh Rana. On the occasion of his birthday... ...there will be a grand celebration in his kingdom for the next seven days. And this invitation accidentally fell into the hands of your servant Pasta. - Pasta. - Yes? This isn't just an invitation, it's a weapon... A weapon which I can use against my father for revenge. I've heard that King Surya Singh Rana doesn't have a son. He has three daughters. Madhu, Mala, Meena. - Who is the eldest one? - Madhu. And if I marry his eldest daughter, Princess Madhu... ...then I will take over the kingdom of Sitamgarh and finish... ...my father and his subjects. Mamma Mia...but how will you go there? Many King's and Prince's will be bringing gifts for the king. What will you take for him? You're a pauper, down-trodden, penniless, beggar... Oh shit! I stepped in shit! Shit... Shit... Today, on the occasion of King Surya Singh Rana's birthday... Princess Mala, Princess Madhu, and Princess Meena... ...have organised this celebration. Arriving first, the king of Turkey... ...Mehmood Bin Maktum. The king has brought One million gold coins... ...and these two swords studded with precious gems. And now, arriving from the kingdom of Madhavgarh... ...Prince Bala Dev Singh. Greetings and pleasantries. Princess Madhu. Is she Princess Madhu or morning dew? What is the meaning of this, Prince Bala. Why did you arrive in the kingdom of Sitamgarh sitting in this squeaky wheel-barrow? Your Highness, on the way I came across an old lady who couldn't walk. And I didn't waste a minute to send that 82 -year-old lady home on my royal chariot... ...and I came here on this broken wheel barrow. Because my father used to say... "Do your duty, and you shall be rewarded." - Your Highness- - But Prince Bala... ...today is my uncle, our king's birthday. Didn't you bring him a gift on this grand occasion? Your Highness, I could've brought you horses and elephants, or... Elephants and horses. Gold and silver coins, or... Silver and gold coins. But these are just illusions Your Highness. Prince Bala has brought a gift far more valuable for you. And that gift is... This piece of shit... I mean soil, your honour. A piece of Madhavgarh's soil. Blessed by our ancestors. This makes a man stay young for a long time. Makes him healthy and vigorous. In fact, this gift isn't for you Your Highness... ...It's for your 120 queens. Really? Bring it to me, quickly! For the sake of the queens. It contains Shilajit, Makradwaj, Kayakalp, and Chavanprash, Your Highness. Open sesame... No, no, no... Suryabhan... Distribute the rest of the gifts amongst my subjects. - Long live... - The king... - Long live... - The king... - Long live... - The king... Every year, on the King's birthday... ...you torture yourself this way. What madness is this, sire? This isn't madness, This is my punishment. This punishment reminds me... ...that another year has passed... ...and I still haven't become the King of Sitamgarh. But now...time is going to change. And so will the ruler. But how? Everything may be fair in love and war... But victory comes to the conspirators. There will be an attack! ...and people will blame the oldest enemy of this kingdom. The chief of the Khookha Tribe, Gama. I'll make a royal dance chamber here, Pasta. And this is where I'll shoot arrows at poor people. Mamma Mia...before you start dreaming of making a torture chamber... - ...you must win Princess Madhu's heart. - Hurry up, hurry up! - Master has begun dancing. - Oh yes! - Master has begun dancing? - Dance! Let's go and see what's happening here? "I am a guy..." "I am a guy..." "I am a guy that loves a guy." "Yes, I love a guy..." "Waiting for a dashing handsome guy.' "That sweeps me off my feet." Master Bangdu! Bangdu? "I'll wound him with my sight." Oh God. I am exhausted. Amazing, Master Bangdu. How are you so talented? Yes, who is your teacher? My teacher? Govinda and Pradbhudeva. - Govinda and Pradbhudeva? - Yes. The almighty Lord Govinda... He's my teacher, and my Lord. But Almighty, I am so tired now. Silly girls, less giggling and more dancing! Yes, teacher. Don't you want my blessings? Forgive us, teacher. God bless you. God bless you. You can come a little closer! "Let me go..." "Why, are you in a hurry..." "My heart skips a beat..." "Why is that?" Oh wow These words should be composed in a song. Let me go. How can I let you go? Someone might see us, teacher. Who would see us here? Prince Bala! Prince Bala! Bangdu. How did you escape? 6-months-ago, when I was teaching dance in your kingdom... What is going on here? What are you doing? You can't just come in here like that. Master Bangdu. Stop this singing and dancing. Prince Bala's regular dancers didn't show up today. So he said to get some girls from here. Come on. Go get the girls. Bloody Pasta, let's see who lays a finger on my girls. Prince. Prince. I beg you...please... Prince, this is a temple of knowledge! Temple of knowledge, huh? Yes. - I want some knowledge! - What? - No, no, don't take her. - Leave me. - Leave me. - What is this cruelty, Prince? These children built this with sheer dedication and effort. I will show them dedication and effort! - Please my prince, let them go. - No, no. I want all of these qualities too! They would've never imagined this in their wildest dreams. I will be their wildest dream! No, no, Leave me. Leave me... Give them freedom, Prince. Get that man as well! Go on boys, grab him too. Prince Bala, think about me too! No, not like that! Prince, maybe you don't remember... ...but first you gave orders to execute your royal executioner. When he heard about these orders, he ran away. And when there was no one to execute us, then how would we die. So we all ran away. You mean till date, I have never killed anyone? No. I don't have any innocent's blood on my hands? Disaster. My life feels worthless. But Prince, what brings you to Sitamgarh? I want to marry Princess Madhu. You and marriage? Of course, of course... Amazing. I'll take your leave. Go, you may leave. Goodbye. Long live the Prince. And I'll go and tell the king, That you may be half man half woman for others... ...but a naughty boy for Princess Mala. Devil's Double, Prince Bala. I will help you. Correction...I am on your side. You will tell me everything... ...about Princess Madhu. So that in a week's time I can coochie-coo with the princess. Hug her, and kiss her... - Fall in mad love. - Impossible. Why is it impossible? Because her bodyguard never lets anyone near her. I've dealt with many bodyguard's like that before. He's no ordinary bodyguard. He's the royal guard of Sitamgarh. He's the mightiest of the mightiest. The Royal bodyguard... Dharamputra. Wow Dharamputra, Wonderful. "Brave heart..." "Strong as a mountain..." "Fearless..." Meena, these words should be composed into a song. Remember Princesses, you must have a firm grip on your sword. Like this? Because a weak grip, is the sign of a weak heart. Yes. Absolutely right, Dharamputra. Brilliant, Prince Bala. I'm guessing your sword skills are quite impressive too. My father used to say... "Knowledge...must always be shared!" Then why don't you share your knowledge with us as well. We would like to see your sword skills too. Pardon me, but I don't fight with women. I was talking about having a duel with our bodyguard Dharamputra. We're dead meat. I'm not carrying my royal sword. We are. Where is it? What else are you hiding down in the cellar? May victory be yours. Side, please. Attack! The sword broke. Let's all go home. We still have this. Here you go. Fight. Thank you. Attack! The bodyguard swings his sword, but Prince Bala ducks. Now Prince Bala attacks with all his might. Prince Bala seems to be winning. Prince Bala seems to be winning. But Dharamputra pushes him. And the Prince falls in the Princess' arms. What happened now, Prince Bala? Nothing. Just an excuse to get close to you. - What? - Yes, my dear. - Bangdu. - Yes, my prince? He is very strong. Doesn't he have any weaknesses? He doesn't have any weaknesses. But, he's someone's weakness. Who's? Princess Meena. We must get Princess Meena on our side. Princess. What am I doing here? And why are you in this condition? I am ruined. I am finished. Stay away from me. You're a monster, not a protector. - Stay away from me. - What did I do? What did you do? Like an animal, all night after drinking, you kept... I kept screaming and yelling... that I am a helpless woman, not some object! I will kill myself. I am a monster, not a protector. I've got no right to live. Huh?! I've got no right to live! I've got no right to live! Dharam! Dharamputra! No... If you kill yourself, then you'll be taking two more lives with you. - Two more? - Yes. Princess Meena and your child in her womb. Mamma Mia... The Royal protector forgot his own protection. No, no, don't blame him... He's just a... "Soldier, Soldier..." "Who with his sweet talks..." "...stole my heart." These words should be composed in a song. Princess, even if I accept this relationship... ...the King will never give his approval. He will. Of course he will. But in order to get his approval You all must help me marry Princess Madhu! She's here. She's here. Where is Master Bangdu? Meena? Mala? Where is everyone? Save me! Dharamputra. Dharamputra. No, listen. Help! That's your duty, but this is your responsibility. Princess. Don't move. Don't move. He's poisonous. If he bites you, then you will die. No. Don't look into the spider's eyes. Look into my eyes. May I keep my hand on your shoulder? Look at me. Are you flirting with me? I'm not flirting with you, I'm just speaking in the spider's language. C'mon, smarten up. Okay. From which mouth do I thank you? Do it from this mouth. God's made such a beautiful mouth. Don't be shy. You saved my life. No.. I saved my life. Madhu. Bala. - Madhu. - Bala. Madhu. Bala. Where did this come from? Bloody fools. The reason for inviting all of you here wasn't just for my birthday... ...in fact, I had a different agenda. Suryabhan. Tomorrow, on the final day of the festivities... All three Princesses will choose their groom. As the tradition follows... ...the Princesses will set the royal birds free. And whoever the royal birds sit on will be their groom. And now for the most important point... The groom chosen for Princess Madhu will be inaugurated as the new King of this kingdom. - Long live... - The king! - Long live... - The king! - Long live... - The king! - Long live... - The king! Disperse. Curse you! You're getting me wrong, son. I said disperse. Meaning leave. Let the ceremony begin. Baldy. Princess Madhu's future groom and the new King of Sitamgarh... - Glory to... - Prince Bala Dev Singh. Mala, Meena... Impossible! This cannot happen! He's not even Royal blood. Forget that Suryabhan, look over there. What's happening there. Forget about Royal blood. He's not even a man. Your Highness, Bangdu is a man. I've checked him myself. Prince Bala, now you're the new King of Sitamgarh. Therefore, your orders are my command. Suryabhan, why are you going into Gama's cave? Going there is like inviting death. I am inviting death. But not my death.... What do you mean? I mean Gama is my last ticket to the throne of Sitamgarh. Suryabhan, what brings you here? Till date, our personal enmity has lead to the deaths of many innocents. And in order to finish this enmity... ...the King has sent you an invitation to the wedding of his princesses He has taken the first step to create peace and friendship. Brother, we should go there in order to finish this enmity. I am a wild dog. I am as dangerous as I am loyal. I can sniff out the traitor from the loyalists. If I ever see you here again, I'll eat you alive. Things didn't go as you had planned, but at least we made it out alive. Who said things didn't go as planned. What do you mean? Look... Gama's brother. The food's delicious. I love it. - Give me more. Give me more. - Take some more sauce. - Sauce? - Yeah... If you can get Pasta in this era, then why not sauce. Boss, some sauce? But Dharamputra, you must admit. God works in mysterious ways to unite lovers. God doesn't work in mysterious ways, his highness Bala does. What? I switched the royal birds with my pets... Neil, Nitin and Mukesh. What? Then where are the royal birds? In our plates. Disgusting! Now let's go... And prepare for the wedding. What about me, boss? You go and play with Giggly Okay boss. Mamma Mia. Giggly... Sauce. What are you looking at? This red sign of marriage? Mirror-Mirror on the wall, we're husband and wife after all. Will you tell on me now. You take a call. Your Majesty, how are you so sure that he will come? Look... You should come as a representative of Khookha Tribe. Once the relationship between us gets better, then Gama will thank you for it. Gama will kill. Revenge! - Long live... - Master Bangdu! - Long live... - His Highness Bala Dev Singh! - Long live... - Dharamputra! - Long live... - The king! - Long live... - The king! - Long live... - The king! Close the doors! Quickly. Close the doors! Your Highness... Gama! Bala, what are you doing here? - You hide too. - But you are the king. You should protect your subjects. To hell with the subjects. - I am leaving. - How can you leave me? You love me, don't you? I don't love you. I did everything so that I could take over your kingdom. And the pigeon that sat on me... ...wasn't your royal pigeon, that was my pet. I had switched them. I know. I saw you switch those pigeons. But I thought you were doing that because you didn't want to lose me. I thought you were doing that for our true love. And I had such blind faith in my God and my ancestor's blessings... ...that I switched those pigeons again. Yes, Prince Bala. The pigeons that sat on you three were our Royal birds! So our love was true... ...but unfortunately you're not worthy of that love. Mala. Meena. You saved my life. No. I saved my life. Dharam! Dharam. You killed my brother? Until I don't behead every member of Sitamgarh's royal family... ... my revenge won't be complete! Pasta. I remember everything. Prince Bala. My poor servant, your master remembers everything. Oh shit. Oh shit. What happened, master? This means Kriti belongs to me. Not Max. And Neha belongs to Max. Not Roy. And Pooja belongs to Roy. Not me. Meaning, in this life we're marrying our sisters-in-law? Oh my, God. But maybe God made me remember everything so that we don't commit this sin. And so that I can make everyone remember their true love. But we only have 36 hours to make them remember... - Oh, God. - God is over there. Lord, I am running out of time. Please help your devotee in this testing period. Give me your blessings, Lord. Ohh... What happened? Lord, I am running out of time. Please help your devotee. Give me your blessings, Lord. God isn't deaf. He heard the first time. Let's go. Oh... - Lord, I am running out of time. - God, why are you joking?! The task of reminding everyone of their past life has been given to a man... ...who forgets everything all the time. Let's go, Prince Bala. We're running out of time. Pasta, now I must go to everyone and remind them... ...that Kriti doesn't belong to Max. She belongs to me. Pooja doesn't belong to me. She belongs to Roy. And Neha doesn't belong to Roy. - She belongs to Max. - Mamma Mia But Prince Bala, when will I find Giggly, my lost love. You will... You will find her soon. Park the car, we'll find her till then. - Park the car. - Okay You saved my life. No, I didn't save your life. I saved my life. - Madhu. - Bala. - Madhu. - Bala. - Madhu. - Bala. Madhu. Harry! How dare you?! You smashed them to pieces. Bloody creep! You pervert! You're supposed to marry my sister tomorrow and today you're trying to kiss me. I will... I will kiss you. - You pervert! - Baby. We've been reborn. - You don't belong to Max, you belong to me. - Reborn my foot! My chest! And not just that, Pooja doesn't belong to me... - She's that scoundrel Roy's - You've lost the plot! And Max belongs to Roy. Max belongs to Roy? Max belongs to Roy? - You've broken my nose! - You've gone mad! Pooja. Sheila. Neha. Madhu... - Listen to me! - Mamma Mia, she's Kriti. Kriti. Kriti. Go to a doctor and get some treatment done! God, why do you always... Poo poo? Why do these pigeons only shit on me? Prince Bala, look at the bright side. They are making you look whiter than white. - What? - I am joking. I'll go and make my brothers remember. Where are they? This way. I will tell them everything. Pooja. Thank God I found you. I must tell you something very important. We're reborn. Calm down. Even I have something important...to show you. No! No! No! Sister-in-law, please. Close your curtains. This is wrong.

Wait a second. Just tell me something. What have I ever done to deserve this? Not now, but in the previous life. But there is no personal grudge. This is a thought from the previous life. To hell with your thought. Think about Neha. Neha keeps thinking about Max herself. - Huh... - What? They are having an affair. They are lovers. When did this happen? - One week ago? - No, no - One month ago? - No! - One year? - No, brother! 600 years ago. Have you lost your mind? - What are you saying? - Hey... "I am a guy...that..."

I'm not having an affair with Neha. Mother swear. Awww baby, I trust you. And anyway, she's like this. Like what? What do you mean by like this? Kriti, I am talking to you as a concerned sister, okay Oh, so as a concerned sister I've got something to tell you aswell. Before pointing fingers at my fiancee... ...you should keep your fiancee in check. What do you mean? Pooja, I didn't want to say this... ...because it will spoil your mood before the wedding. But I am sorry, you've asked for it. Your Harry is a pervert. He was flirting with me. - What? - He tried to kiss me. He came this... No... - This close, baby... - Pervert! I knew he was a lowlife, but I never thought he'll stoop this low. - I won't leave that scoundrel - Hey.. Don't you dare say anything about my Harry. He's such a decent guy that he didn't even kiss his own fiancee... ...why would he try to kiss you? Pooja... I want an honest answer. What's going on between you and Roy? Nothing. Have you lost your mind? - Don't lie to me. - Wow... Match made in Heaven. Her fiancee is hitting on me... ...and she's hitting on her fiancee. What a couple. Wait. I'll let you in on a little secret about her. Back in college, she stole your boyfriend. By telling him that you're a lesbian. Don't believe her. - Shut up. - You shut up! - You shut up! - You shut up! Keep your volume down! Have you gone ballistically paranoid? Sorry but What is this mackerel, shrimp, tuna, fish market?

I don't care either. Bloody pervert. Mamma Mia, Prince Bala what is wrong with you? You used to kill and now you're getting killed! My brothers are quarreling with me. These three women are quarreling within themselves. The wedding is in 31 hours. If we don't do something... ...then we'll have to marry our sisters-in-law. Mamma Mia, we prayed to God... ...he will definitely send an angel to rescue us. - Where is that angel? - Here I am. I remember everything. I look a little ugly... People say I am silly. But I am 1419's... ...Giggly! Master Bangdu! Your sweetheart's going with someone else. In the previous life, "Oh I am exhausted." Dharamputra! It doesn't matter what anybody says.. ...you're the strongest bodyguard. What the hell is he saying?! Meena, Mala, Madhu... ...can I soap your backs again and rub you. What? King Surya Singh Rana. Stop being over smart Whenever I wore a skirt. You would keep staring... ...at me and flirt. Hey... Prince Bala...I remember your 'Phish Phish'... This is how you would dismiss. Who is he? Remember? Mamma mia...Winston Churchgate is Giggly?! Aakhri Pasta! Your love has finally found it's destination. "My dear Pasta..." "...when you lay your sights on me..." "...you make this Giggly shy." "Swing that bat." "I am your Giggly..." "This game is so much fun." You're my husband, I am your wife. Shower me with your love... ...or I will tear your apart.

I've even come up with names? Shabana, Sultana, Ruksana. And after that...please stop. Pasta. You always said that God will send an angel to rescue us. - Do you know who that angel is? - Who? Giggly. Giggly? You anointed her forehead and she remembered her past. Meaning, I will have to show Kriti something personal... ...and then she will remember. Prince Bala, what personal thing are you going to show her. Not that. Look at this! Makduddin! - See you at the wedding. - Bye, bye... Makduddin! Hey mister... Operation. - Mamma Mia. - Hey, come here! - Hi. - Harry? Do you remember? Do you remember? - You killed my spider. - Shut up! How dare you? I know guys like you very well. When you can't score with a girl... ...you throw acid on her face to vent your anger and frustration. And since you couldn't find any acid here, you threw a spider on my face. - No.. - You freak. Wait... I am not going to spare you today. What kind of a love story is this? - My bum... - I will make your bum burn! - Stop. Don't hit me. - Say sorry! First my front side and now my backside! Stay away from me! "You're my everything! You're my sweetheart!" My Makduddin... You cannot die, son. Wake up. Wake up for me, son. Wake up. Do you want oxygen? Let me give you oxygen from here My soulmate!! Guys! I am telling you, you're making a big mistake blaming Harry. He can never do something like that. Never? Pooja, he threw a poisonous spider on my face. He only threw a spider on your face... ...he was telling me to lick a piece of shit. - Yuck... - That's impossible. Impossible?! Who told you that I'm having an affair with Neha? Harry. And who told you that Roy loves Pooja. - Harry. - See... Harry is the root of all these problems. Let's go and speak to him now! Come. Forgive me, pigeons. Forgive me. In the previous life, I ate you. In this life you cannot eat me... ...but you can shower me with what you ate. Shit on me. Shit on me as hard as you can. Its the only way to atone for my sins, angry birds. Dad. Harry's completely lost it. No my child, don't lose heart. I will take Harry to the best psychiatrist in town. Please don't cry No doctor can treat him, Thakral This is Sitamgarh. And ghostly possessions are pretty common out here. - What nonsense. - This is not nonsense. In fact it's the truth. - My god! - Look... "Pasta, when will we walk down the aisle." Take a look at the Hotel Manager. Now he's wearing a sari, he's put on lipstick, and his voice has changed. He's behaving so weirdly. - You're not my wife. - Come here... Similarly... your son-in-law's been possessed as well. My poor Harry, he's possessed. So sorry. Don't worry, dear I know someone who... ...who is an expert in exorcising ghosts. Ramsey Baba. Why are we here? - Scary looking place, man - Who are we meeting here? Ramsey Baba... ...he will exorcise the ghost possessing you. - Ghost? - Yes... But Ramsey Baba has a problem. - What? - What? He's possessed by a ghost himself. Who's ghost? His wife. - What? - What? What if he makes things worse? No, he won't. He will set things straight. Because he thinks straight, he talks straight, and his methods are straight too. Look... Ramsey Baba is coming straight towards us. Hey upside down mister ...look straight this way. Harry! I'll remove your inner cherry. Sometime I feel I am the God. Sometimes I feel I am God. - You're joking.. - And I am not joking. Yeah yeah My darling! I won't give up until I exorcise the ghost inside of you. What is going on here? You think you're an exorcist? All he does is laze around all day. And stuffs his face. But give him a job, he'll never do it straight. You guys are here. I didn't know. What would you guys like to have? Black tea, green tea. Guys.. How will he exorcise my Harry, when he's possessed himself?! Sorry... Sorry... Wife strength...husband patience. But... - Mr Ramsey...my nipples...my nipples... - I'll get rid of everything... With my power and devotion I will destroy the ghost inside you. Hocus-Pocus! Idiot...what is this? Take my favourite heroine's name. Alia Bhatt. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Okay. Why are you hitting me? The ghost is inside of you, not me! This man is crazy! "Won't you take my blessings?" He remembers! He remembers! Bangdu!! Forgive us, birds. Forgive us. We had heard of a saying, 'bird's of a feather flock together'. But let's change it a bit. Birds of a feather, shit on us together. Shit on us. Shit on our head. Shit wherever you want to shit Siskeria! What is this? First the ghost was possessing only one. Now both of them are possessed. Father. This place is jinxed. Let's cancel this wedding. "Then how will we return Michael and Big Bhai's money?" No. No, we won't cancel the wedding. My brothers are not possessed. If they were actually possessed, that shaman would've exorcised them. They are just getting nervous before the wedding. I will talk to my brothers. Meanwhile you guys go and get ready. Its almost time. - Are you sure? - Yes, I am sure. "We made a mistake, please forgive us." Stop it. Look behind you! Dharamputra. Wrong. We're in big trouble. Big Bhai's called a dozen times. Michael is coming over for the wedding. - What? - What? Yes. So please stop acting stupid and get ready for the wedding functions. Max, He was right. We've all been reincarnated. Wait a minute. Let me explain. Brother, it's very-very simple. His wife is not his wife. She is your wife. And our sister-in-law. And my wife is not my wife. She is his wife. And our sister-in-law. And your wife is not your wife. - She is my wife. - Kriti is mine. Max. Stay in your limits. Let me tell you. Kriti...was mine, she still is, and forever will be. Max! What are you doing?! Stop it you guys. Prince Bala. What did you just say? Prince Bala. Dharamputra. Bangdu. You know, now I've finally understood fate's master plan. It's all predestined. And Mr. Forgetful here... He caused us so much trouble, because he kept forgetting! I abused him so much for it. But imagine, if he didn't have this condition... ...and didn't wash Michael's money, we would've never gone after these three girls. Yes. Saving the girls, and their dad accepting us. The spinning of that globe and always stopping on Sitamgarh. All of this happened so that we could take on the responsibility of getting our true love. The biggest player...is God. Imagine 1419... 1419... And now 2019. Even after 6 centuries our true love still prevails. - Correct. - What's correct? We only have 22 hours until the wedding. Let's come up with a plan. We've hurt them a lot, haven't we? First let's go and apologize to them three. But will they forgive us? We know that we have hurt you three a lot and we're not worthy of your forgiveness. But if possible, please forgive us. Shit on us. Shit on our head. Why aren't they shitting on us? What if they have forgiven us? O pigeons, if you have forgiven us... ...then please give us a sign so that we know that you've forgiven us. They've forgiven us! He scratched his head to show the sign! Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Now we must remind the girls. - Yes - Come on. Come on Bye bye birds! Gentlemen... And my ladies. Girls. Before you react... - We want to tell you something. - Speak up. ...their cousin brother, lets welcome the famous singer... Pappu Rangeela. Brother Pappu. Come, come lets go! Pappu? Sounds like some roadside singer. "Revenge!" Gama!! "Revenge!" "Gama!" Where is Pappu? - "Revenge-Revenge-Revenge." - Coming. Coming. We're going. "Sa...Re" You've got such a beautiful voice, brother. Sing with me. Sa Re... Great. You guys sing too. - Sing guys! - Sing baby! Sa Re... No, no,... You guys sing... Sa Re Ga Ma... Ga Ma... Gama! They are on a higher pitch. You know what, you guys sing... Ga Ma Ma Re Ga. - No, no, no, no - Why not? Don't be scared. - Please sing. - Baby, come on! Ga.. Ma..Ma.. Re..Ga.. - Sing! - Baby, come on sing. GAMA WILL KILL US! Ga Ma Ma Re Ga. GAMA WILL KILL US! Absolutely right. Gama will kill. Our wedding is tomorrow. On one hand we want the girls to remember the past life... ...and on the other hand we don't want brother Pappu to remember the past life. Otherwise Pappu will turn into Gama and kill us all. Why do you think so negative? - Does he remember yet? - No. So then he won't remember. - Hey! Why are you hiding? - Let go of me! I don't want to come! - The sounds are coming from here. - I can hear that too. Bodyguard. Go inside, and check who it is. Bodyguard my foot! That was in my previous life. You go. I think he's doing these things in his sleep. He's mad, he's smashing his head against the window. A L D A B. Marathi? Don't move. Don't move. He's fallen asleep. But what does A L D A B mean? What does it mean? Maybe some shop Dubai? It's some shop in Dubai! B A D L A (Revenge) It means Revenge! Revenge?! Meaning he's starting to remember everything! - Run. Run. Run. Run. - Gama's revenge! Gama's revenge! This way. This way. Slowly, slowly! "My sweety, my angel, Giggly's crazy about you." - Get lost! - Hey Mister! It's time for the wedding. Where are the grooms? It's time to marry our sisters-in-law. Let's go. We're so screwed and you're trying to make jokes. This whole thing is a joke! The girls don't remember anything. But Gama's starting to remember everything. I say let's just leave everything and run away from here! No. We won't run away. If God has brought us this far... ...He will lead us to our destination too. Mamma Mia. I've got some extra good news for you three! And I am not joking. Giggly was chasing me... ...and whilst I was trying to escape her ...we landed up in the basement. Call it romantically or accidentally... ...Guess what I found? What? This painting from our previous life. This is that same painting! Oh, God. This will sort out all of our problems! If the girls see this painting, they will remember everything. Yes! Pasta and Giggly, many thanks to you two. God bless you, God bless you! Hey Mister! Come on, let's find the girls and show them the painting together. Yes. You check in the room and we'll check the hall. Okay! - Thank you. - Thank you. See... Even the prince took my blessings! - You will marry me now, won't you?! - I will never be your husband! - Mamma Mia... - Let me teach you! Hello, Reception.

"...as a gesture of his friendship." "We must go there in order to finish this enmity." "My revenge will be complete only after I kill you all." "REVENGE!" I am sure Gama must have seen the painting by now. - Be strong. - Not now Giggly, let us think. Shut up! I'll tell you what to do. - Take a rope- - Got it. - and tie a tight knot. - Tied it.

What is going on? - Please just shut up! - Which is why Michael Bhai arrived... ...today instead of tomorrow. To see...whether you three are getting married or not. And to see...if someone's trying to stop the wedding. Hey overgrown moose... Bahubali's nephew. - Should I pull the pin? - I'm Gama! - GAMA!!! - Leave me. "I am a wild dog." "I can sniff out the traitor from the loyalist." It's a good thing...you shot this monster. Yes Michael Sir! This monster made our lives hell. Look... He stabbed me four times.

Suryabhan. Yes! I remember everything. Look and learn! You should take lessons from him. He just reached and remembered everything. Suryabhan! I've been chasing her around the hotel for three days, but she doesn't remember anything. All she keeps asking is... "What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? " - We remember everything! - Yes Suryabhan We were supposed to get married in our previous life. But unfortunately... the marriage dais fell on us. No Prince Bala! Prince Bala? 600-years-ago the dais didn't fall on its own. Someone made it collapse. You killed my brother? My revenge will be complete after every single one of you is dead. Make it fall!

You will kill me before anybody else will, idiot! Bala, are you okay? - Come in front of me and ask! - Sorry. - Come in front of me and ask! - Are you okay? Yes, I am fine. This is Dharamputra's fist... ...not Max's. - Hi? - Hi. - Get ready for more - And...I'm screwed again like London Wait! This isn't your job! Prince Bala! Fate works in mysterious ways. Destiny. 600-years-later... Same old you, same old me, and the same old place. There is one thing about history that you should know... When it repeats itself, everyone seems to be in the same position There is something you should know about fate too! When fate completes a full circle... ...the tables turn on their own. "REVENGE!" Won't you hug your brother? Hey, don't be scared I won't hurt you. - Are you sure? - I'm sure! Peace! Gama...won't kill. Don't cry children. Don't cry. Let's go.
