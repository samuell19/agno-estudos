story: A Music Story The entire building is full of sounds. Some people may call it noise. The best thing with my school is, I can do what I want and still go to school. My name is Moa, I am 11 years old. As you probably get, I love music. All kinds of music. My dream is to become a pop star, to be just as good as Ace Wilder. We have different teachers. One of them teaches rap and pop music. He told us: "Always do what you believe in." But we have other, boring teachers who think scales and stuff are important. Mom and Dad are also into music. My Mom is a voice coach, but her dream is to become a solo artist. But she says she has to find her voice first. I don't get why. My Dad is a pianist. He used to be famous, he sold lots of records. But nowadays, people download music for free. Anton, what the hell! Don't you ever turn your phone on? Dad's manager, Alexander, has crazy plans for how Dad could make money. I am sure he is kind, but I wonder if he knows what he is doing. I have to do everything myself. Damn, no one ever helps out! Wait a minute! You make everything so damn complicated. You don't need that many notes. Calm down a bit, won't you. I know you can use all your fingers, but it's unnecessary. People aren't impressed by competence, you just have to seem competent. Music is all about attitude. People need to identify. Not too many notes. Listen to this. Listen and enjoy and learn something. Simple, people get this. Then, a choir in the background. "Do be do"... Something like that. This can be used in commercials or something. You can sell all sorts of garbage with this music. Or even better, sex. Sex, that's commercial. Kinky bizarre, that's what you are Alexander is a bit wacko, but he did get Dad a job. One day at a time Oh, you are in your prime Oh, weather in mind! I am back, the sunshine in your lives. And like a storm I enter the show, and our topic is indeed weather. First I want to introduce our fantastic bandmaster, Anton Widebeck. This show is sponsored by "Sweet Idols". Apply now and win lots of money. "Sweet Idols" seems like fun. Get the cash, cop the trash How can you tell me my record got no creative message? I'm in it to win it, do whatever it takes Speed like an athlete, no brakes Your rap is great But right now you wanna listen to me I wanna sing my heart out I wanna sing my heart out I really fell I'm a steal mics coming around what you gonna do? Great, all at once... Rap works great in our competition. -So it doesn't have to be classical? -No, any kind of music is fine. But you have to write the song yourself. Then it's the audition. But does the song have to be ready then? It's easier for us in the jury to get a grasp of the song. But you do have time later, when you are making the video. -Video? Is there going to be a video? -Yes, of course! -Yes, everyone gets to do a video. -That's great! -Is it going to be on TV? -If you make it to the finals. -Can I be in on it? -Yes, write your name here. See you at the audition, then! And don't forget the sweets. "Sweet Idols" has its' own sweets, of course. There you are. That sounds great. -Dad? -Yes. -Dad? -Yes. -Dad! -Yes. "Sweet Idols". It's a competition, you write a song. -You go to Stockholm, get to be on TV. -TV? Hm. -Ace won that competition. -Okay, right. It would be great fun to write my own song. Are you going to apply for "Sweet Idols"? Yes... Or, I don't know. Maybe. -It's would be so cool to... -No, I don't want you to apply. It's so damn tiresome that everyone has to compete all the time! Everyone watches this on TV! It's great fun. No, I don't think so. Of course you can write your music. But the juries are all corrupt. No one cares about the musicians. -No, write your music... Music flows... -Anton? It comes from inside of you, juries and TV-shows have nothing to do with it. Music has to come from the heart, you can't just be a sell-out. -Play it again. -Which one? Place your thumb on "C", then you can reach it. Why don't you do concerts? I have to figure out what music to write. You can write a musical. "Mamma Mia". People of yours and Mom's age like that kind of thing. Moa, that's not a good idea. -Is it hard to write musicals? -I don't know, but... I know I've been a fool I should have been there for you How can I make it up How can I make it up How can I make it up Make it up to you I will write a simple song for you Let me show you What a simple song can do It makes me never run away from you Let me show you what a simple song can do It mustn't be that hard Go easy on yourself Don't don't don't run away Don't don't don't run away Don't don't don't run away Don't you run away I will write a simple song for you Let me show you What a simple song can do It makes me never run away from you Let me show you What a simple song can do Don't don't don't run away Don't don't don't run away Don't you run away Don't don't don't run away Don't don't don't run away Don't you run away Don't run away I watched that show "Sweet Idols" yesterday. A boy of four won and went on to the next round. -He had a fantastic voice. -Why should kids compete in music? On air, in two minutes! And remember, no sheet music during live broadcasts. Anton, things are changing. The directors want a new target audience. The demographic analysis says you don't have the right persona. -Are they going to replace the host, too? -I think we have to clarify things. You are a really good pianist, but I can get a pianist for 1 000 Crowns. You musicians and artists can be replaced. Your only job is to attract money from sponsors. And you don't do that, Anton. You simply can't work here anymore. -Yes, everyone else is an idiot... -It's so humiliating to be there. -After an hour, I was told to go online. -You have to register at the Job center! -And get a regular job? -Take what you get. There are no jobs for me there. I am a musician, damnit! What are we going to do, then? -What the hell do you want me to say? -What is 7 times 8? 56. - It's not all about you now. You compose wonderful music, but you are living in a dream world. You have to sell the grand piano, apply for a new job! Stop fighting! -We shouldn't argue in front of her. -No, that was stupid of us. "You have to apply for a new job!" Anton? My salary won't cover these. If you don't take responsibility, I want a divorce. I don't want this anymore. First comes the spark Then comes the fire Can't make a wish Without desire First comes the bubble Then comes the burst You can't come home Without leaving first Two broken wings without a dove There's nothing I can do Without your love There's no desert with no thirst You can't come home Without leaving first First comes the tear Then comes the bliss I'll lose my lips Without your kiss First comes the spark Then comes the fire Can't make a wish Without desire Two broken wings without a dove There's nothing I can do Without your love There's no desert with no thirst You can't come home Without leaving first Mom and I aren't so angry with each other. We discuss things, like grown-ups do. I don't like it when grown-ups discuss things. I hope you aren't selling the grand piano or the instruments? No, I promise. Don't they like your music anymore? No, it seems not. Mom says we have no money. No, I have to find a new job. But isn't music your job? Why don't you write new music? -You have to be inspired to do that. -How can you be inspired? All big stars do Christmas tours. Alexander booked Dad at elderly people's homes. That was good, because then I could come along. Play some real music, like something from "Mamma Mia". -ABBA is great. -Please be quiet! Is that your Dad? I have never heard anyone improvise with Schubert's piano music like that. -Do you play the piano as well? -I sing. The voice is the hardest instrument of all. It reaches right into the soul. -My name is Maja. What is yours? -Moa. Could you please come visit and sing for me sometime? How do we get young people to listen to classical music? Don't worry, Per Arne. Our youngsters know their stuff, the music is perfect. Everything is going to be okay. Here, listen to this. Yes. Is this Ice Wider? -Ace Wilder, you mean. -Alright. I am sure this music has qualities I don't perceive. -But I want to learn this. -Moa, we should start with the basics. That's important. Place your hands like this and we do what we always do. It's so fun you came back to visit me. -How are you doing? -The teacher doesn't let me pick songs. He can't decide these things. But I have decided to compete in "Sweet Idols". -The music competition? -Yes, for song composers. But I am too scared to tell Mom and Dad. You don't have to tell them everything. This can be our little secret. -Do you have a song? -No. That's the problem and the audition is coming up. Dad had to get a job as a painter. He said: "If you can't play what you want, it's better to do something else." But he didn't factor in Alexander's new idea. I've got the greatest idea! You and me are going to make our own label of beer! All the celebrities have their own label of beer nowadays. "Anton Widebeck's beer", right? 8,5 percent. Let's get everyone in Sweden drunk! Hi there. Hello. Alexander, I just called. Here is this contract for the AW beer, After Work. You just have to sign right there. -No, I don't know what... -Let's say 15 000 beers by Wednesday. 15 000? That's impossible. -We have to label them and... -I'll do these things. If you could deliver the bottles to the restaurant by Wednesday. We are doing a showcase then. -Yes, but you have to pay in advance. -In advance...? Sometimes Dad daydreams, that's when the music comes to him. Like from another world. The most beautiful words That I've written I have tied to a wreath of dreams I no longer take words for granted I'm released from all balance it seems What becomes of a letter from spring? A voice that's approaching again I still wonder what it can bring I hope my poor heart starts to sing Springs from the past are A strange art of presence They've never felt stronger than now I'll remember our foxtrot To Beethoven's fifth When your kiss flew away like a swift Anton. I ran into Alexander. He was talking about some bill for beer labels. What are you two up to? I got the bill for the beer labels, they were damned expensive. -I didn't ask for 15 000 bottles. -We got a bulk discount. -But I am broke. -You must have something worth selling. I've helped you lots. I got you the job at "Weather In Mind". And now I got this beer label. Now you have to do your part. Hand me a dollar Hand me a pound Hand me your diamonds Hand me the crown I'm not waiting for Santa I'm not waiting no more I've paid for the ticket And travelled a thousand times before But it seems right now Right now Right now I'm stuck on the bus Right now Right now Right now But soon I will come home to you To you To you With dollars of my own Sorry. "Transaction not permitted." Do you have any cash? Damn it... Here's what we can do. Leave your meter running, I'll pawn these things- -and then I'll be right back. No smaller bills? I'm just joking. -What's up, Moa? -The instruments are gone! -It's alright, Moa. -But where are they? I need my synth! I left them... I lent them to a friend. -But he is returning them real soon. -But my synth! Wait. Sorry, Moa. Anton, Bengt comes back tomorrow. So there is no more work for you. Moa? Hello, Moa? How am I going to finish my song for "Sweet Idols" without my synth? Everything is just crap. I'm never going to be a pop star. One, two, three... One, two, three... One, two, three, one, two, three... -What are you doing? -I'm writing a song. Showing it to my fans. - Hi! -For "Sweet Idols"? -Maybe. -Do you want to help me? -Mm. This is how we do it. We need a verse. The verse isn't super important, but we need it. It has to be emotional, and start low. Then a bridge, we build it up, and a massive chorus. A massive chorus where we sing out loud. I know! Let's write a song about a song competition. Priscilla went to the desert With her mix tapes in a trunk She never called me since that day When the band became too drunk We all end up like celebrities Watching dreams that disappear Illusion is reality You'd better franchise your tears But I all I wanna do is to bring her back She disappeared With the suitcase that I packed And all that's left for me to do is cry Like an American idol Like an American idol Like an American idol Like an American idol Oh yeah Like an American idol Like an American Idol Like an American idol Like an American idol -Nice display. -Thanks. -I'm in the music industry. -Oh, really? I've manufactured my own beer. It's called "AW". It's the initials of the musician Anton Widebeck. Oh, right. -Maybe you want to test-sell it? -I don't know, there are so many beers. The target group has to be very defined. -Which beer sells best? -During summer, it's this colorful "AB". -"AB"? -Yes, "After Beach". -Packaging is everything. -Yes, absolutely not the contents. Bye, now. -I'm writing a musical. -A musical? -What's the point of that? -Listen to this, then. First comes the spark Then comes the fire Wait, wait... A musical? Finally, you get an idea that could bring in some money. The song isn't that great, but that can be changed. Play something, just hammer away... You get it, right? We have to... Who is that, singing? -That's Moa. -Oh, yes? I can't hear anything! -You have a beautiful voice. -Thank you. -What song is this? -I'm trying to write my own song. But it's a bit hard, I don't have a synth anymore. No, right... Is there a special purpose for the song? I want to compete in "Sweet Idols". But it's a secret. Don't tell Mom and Dad. I promise. I lost my painting job today. The regular guy is back at work. Nothing is ever easy for us! You aren't the only one with dreams. I would have liked to take a course in improvised singing. And how could you sell Moa's synth and keep the grand piano? That's great, let's continue these improvisations. -If you want to. Do you want too? -Yeah. -Great! Until next week, then. -Yes. Bye now! Damn it all, what the hell! Welcome. Today we are going to talk about my big love. That is, the written word, the lyrics. When I was younger, I hated to read and write. Until I realized how powerful words are in music. I thought of the English word "spelling". "Spell", sounds like wizardry. Then I thought about the Swedish word for "spelling". That's "stava". What's "stav"? You walk with it, or it's a magical wand. Then I thought: "Hm, words are magical." My music affects me in so many ways And I'm leaving my place here on Earth And take to the skies I live in the moment Give me an umbrella 'Cause music and lyrics are falling I'm growing, but everything's here Gathered it's laying but kept in its' pieces Written in ink and it's ever so precious Cast me in bronze And I'll take down the speakers... Cast me in bronze And I'll take down the speakers... I swear Make of me a statue when I am gone Put me in a place Where you'll come along Show all the living Art is all that is really true Show all the living It all will come through I'm seeking my music attempting I labor Fighting and biting, I sing and I clamor Give all for culture the beats and the mic Poems come first feeling depleted Look down the road check out the statue Watch how they glare Stop all the panic, my house stands tall Return to the traffic, doctor's on call Make of me a statue when I am gone Put me in a place Where you'll come along Show all the living That art is all that's really true Show all the living It all will come through I applied to "Sweet Idols" for you. Alexander. Before I let you free to take your phone calls and texts, I just want to say- -try to listen to the music, analyze the lyrics. And see if you can find some magic for yourselves. -Are you good at writing lyrics? -No, not really. The audition is the day after tomorrow- -and I don't know what it's supposed to be about and I don't have any lyrics. When I was a kid, I learnt a rhyme. It goes round and round like a melody Round and round to set you free Round and round like a spinning wheel Round and round in harmony Round and round... Round... -Elisabet. -Mom? -Is it still unpaid? -Mom, how do you spell "clouds"? No, I understand. I will do it. Definitely. Thank you. I have no Internet access. Did you take the router, Moa? How do you spell "clouds"? C, L, O, U, D, S. Is this English homework? No, I am writing lyrics. "Clouds"... Clouds! Clouds... I had no idea you were writing a song. Can't you sing that song you sang for me when I was a kid? Right. No, I have to pay a really important bill. I should have paid it two weeks ago. Mom had lost the joy of singing and was stuck in some grey everyday life. -What's happened? -Anton lost his job. And he is so established! It's a long story. But I am a member of the Swedish Hymnal Board. -Could Anton imagine writing a hymn? -Yes, absolutely! And we need someone to perform the hymns. Oh... I will have to think about it. Hymn lyrics should strive to be very free- -but they have to submit to the teachings of Christ. Sometimes I come along with Mom when she works. It's not always great fun. Can a free verse be done solo, and the congregation sings the chorus? Hymns are not sung solo, they should encompass the praise of the people. "What do you believe in, Mom?" -What are you saying? -"What do you believe in, Mom?" You can't disturb me now. Why are you speaking English? -Please Mom, sing that song to me. -Not now! -What song, anyway? -You sang it to me when I was little. You ask in whom I put my trust If there's a temple far from here Flights of angels with no wings If there's a judge it won't be me What else is here for me to see? I believe in gravity I believe in all the things I see Right here in front of me Like eternity Like you and me If I was blind And you could see Is there a place you'd rather be Is there a truth that's always true? A place where skies are always blue -I am writing the song. -Oh! Could you sing it to me? -I'm not done with it yet. -Do you want to sing something else? What else is here for me to see? I believe in gravity I believe in all the things I see Right here in front of me Like eternity Like you and me Darned, that's good! You have a great voice! I'm going to tell you something. When I was your age, I wanted to be a rock drummer. Imagine, we could have formed a band together. -We could do that anyway. -No. My tired arms couldn't hold on to the drumsticks anymore. But I would want you to continue with your singing. Per Arne might have a job for you. I hope you didn't say yes. Only You Brings the love into A broken heart of a fool Anton, "mercy" is two syllables. "Heart" is just one. I would prefer the number of syllables to be the same. -I can strike the word "heart". -Good. Moving on. Without You I'm half as good Like an angel with no wings... -The word "you", do you mean "God"? -"You" sounded right. It's good to know who the lyrics are about. We are facing great challenges, as you can see. On the one hand, we are trying to renew the practice of hymn singing... ...but on the other hand, we have to show respect for tradition. What if we try improvising a little? Elisabet. Could you step forward and try to improvise a part? -Come on, have a go! -I could try, I guess. From here. A guitar with no strings A song with no words Dad must have listened to me, he got more inspired to write the musical. I just got an idea. Make believe as the old song goes It will last all my life Act the master - you may regret it Someday you'll lose your lines I tried learning my lesson I tried dropping my mask I found no magic carpet left on the ground But a few grains of sand Tried to walk on the new Milky Way Down memory lane A storm with no wind A tear with no eye The truth with no faith Where in the ecclesiastical year would this hit song fit in? Alexander never stopped dreaming of how him and Dad were going to be rich. Hi there! Who is in your target group? If your answer is "everyone", you are making the most common mistake. A target group must be defined in every last detail. At pitch forum, we don't rely on chance. Are you a winner or a loser? This is great. You get to present your ideas to several investors. You can get millions, if you are lucky. -Who invests in music? -Aren't you doing a musical? -Yes. -Then you need money. Pitch forum is just one of my ideas. And I figured out, you can apply for different cultural grants and stuff. But you have to write something so they are willing to give you money. -I don't believe in this. -Help me a bit, won't you! Come on! Say something. I would write something along the lines of "Jesus Christ Superstar". But about an eleven-year-old girl who wants to be a star. -What the hell have you been smoking? -But it's great! Say the project is for children and young people. That's great. Everyone likes children and young people. Well, children, at least. Hi Moa! Is your song for "Sweet Idols" going to be done in time? Alexander. Moa! Open the door! -Give me my synth first! -You can't have that now! -What are you doing in there? -I don't want to talk. You can't enter that competition. It doesn't matter anymore! What would you say if I already entered? I have to decide some things for myself! Okay, thanks Moa. Really good. Could you imagine playing with a bit more feeling? When you got something to be proud of Just sing it out louder Excuse me, could you lower the tempo? -Slow down? -Yes. I think your chances would be better with a sad piano ballad. It goes round and round and round Like a melody -Well... What do we say? -Is it "sweet"? The song doesn't seem to be finished, but you are very musical for your age. I would be willing to give her another chance. But then your song should be finished when you come back here. It felt so strange that the jury wanted to decide so many things. -Can you make a happy song sad? -What do you mean? Everyone says something different. The jury wants me to make it sad. What do you want? I want it to be upbeat and happy. My big idol was John Bonham in Led Zeppelin. I just loved how he played the drums! I started practicing. My goal was to sound exactly like John Bonham. But it didn't go that great. I understood I had to simplify things, play like Maja. Then it sounded much better. -Has Alexander taken up singing? -Sounds improbable to me. Strange. He called me and wanted vocal coaching. I have always wondered, how you find your own voice. That's a good question. I have given that a great deal of thought. I am thinking, that you do have to find your own voice. And it's not always like...what you want it to be like. You have to search for your own voice. Not anyone's you want to emulate. Then your voice can grow much larger, become more- -than what you first imagined. Your daughter Moa, she has a fantastic voice. -She must get it from you. -Yes, she has. I have been thinking about starting a musical project. I'm going to apply for money for this. There could be school tours and the like. Funny you should say that! We have a flute teacher here at school. Jan, he is very informed about these things. He is even chairman of a foundation- -handing out money for regional development purposes. You have to speak to him. But he can be a bit difficult. He sees through anyone who applies to gain something personally. I do love the austerity of Edgard VarŠses music. Sorry, I am a bit late. What did you want to talk about? I have understood that you are very informed- -about grants suitable for a music project- -for children and young people in this region. First of all I have to say... My time is very limited. And when I engage in something- -I have to feel completely dedicated. Do you have any kind of budget? I have some ideas. Maybe we could sit down and talk about it? Alexander, why do people lie? -What do you mean? -I will repeat my question. Why do people lie, Alexander? I guess you do it to gain something. That's the right answer! Yes, people lie in order to gain something. My opinion is rather- -that this is something you do for your own benefit. -Isn't that so, Alexander? -What are you talking about? Do you admit it, Alexander? Do you admit it? -Do you admit it? -Yes, I admit it! There, there. Since I am a member of the board, I can tell you- -that it would have been refused anyway. I have something for you. It's a kind of music program I bought a while ago. It's like a music studio for home use. And you, you need it much more than I do. -Go home and write your song. -Thank you. -Hello? -Hi Anton, Alexander here. I am going to get a free consultation from pitch forum. I don't believe in that pitch forum. And one more thing. Moa isn't going to compete in some song competition. -That's why she was writing a song. -Yes. But I think she is too young to compete in music. Do you really think so? -Tell me, what did you want? -I've seen you on Youtube and... You can begin by telling me why your project is going to make an impact. -Well, I have a great idea... -A pitch, ten seconds! -Stand up! Come on! -What? A pitch. -Stand on both legs! -Yes, I am standing up. -Come on! Ten seconds. -Classical music... -...meeting improvisations... -One, two, three. Stand tall, speak up! Stand tall! Think of your target group. What is behind it all? Falling Falling apart When you are running out of time You couldn't see You couldn't see it from the start What you can't see you cannot find When you're falling apart You think you'll never be the same The puzzle's falling apart Just put the pieces back again and again Just put the pieces back again Falling Falling apart Face the music and let go When you're falling apart Just put the pieces back again and again Just put the pieces back again Again and again Just put the pieces back again Just so you know, we speak English at pitch forum. That's not a problem. I am good at English. I am very honored to be here today- -and talk to you all about the Swedish music wonder. It's a real wonder, popular, all over the world. And, and we have, in the seventies, ABBA, you know. ABBA, "Waterloo". And also, today, we have the Polar Music Prize, with also... We have the winner there, Max Martin, who is also Swedish and famous. And, I also want to...say... We also have the, the...the flowing in the cash. And I also feel that... Our most important project... ...is a young artist called Moa. And I am also sure that it will go very long and be very famous... Very famous, world...wide. I'm done with music now. I'm going to work on the beer label instead. We will get 40 ”re per bottle, then to hell with it. I did tell you Moa is too young to compete in music. It comes natural for kids these days to compete in music. Every nine-year-old has their own Youtube channel. Don't you see why Moa doesn't dare speak to you? It's you who is stopping her. You have one daughter. Help her with the song instead. Please Moa, open the door. Things don't always work out the way you planned. Go away! Where is my synth? You sold it. -I didn't sell it. -You pawned it, for peanuts! -But Moa, I promise you... -You can't promise anything anymore! This feels terrible. I can get the synth immediately. Moa, I don't know how my thoughts went about your synth. -I shouldn't have done that. -No, you shouldn't have done that. I have been really stupid. I should have listened to you. But I want to tell you something. I want to... I would like to... I want to tell you something. I'm thinking... Why is it so hard for grown-ups to say "I am sorry"? -Do you really want to enter? -I have wanted it all along. Moa, I'm sorry. Of course you should be in the competition. Thanks, Dad! -How is it going with the musical? -I am doing the last scene. But I don't know if the end is going to be happy or sad. But Dad, everyone wants a happy end. -Well, hello! -Hi there. I am so glad it's working out for you. We at pitch forum are going to arrange a charity event. What if Moa and her family could make a performance? No one gets paid, but to be seen there really benefits the musicians. Really? It's no good at all for the musicians. It might be good for pitch forum, but it's no good for the musicians. But listen, try one of these! Damned cheapskate! -The song turned out great. -Yes, it did. Did you remember to apply to "Sweet Idols"? It should be stamped today. -Did you post it, Anton? -Damned...! What do we do now?! This is completely crazy! Damned rolls... Are you totally wacko? Are you going to swim to town?! Yes! -It's too late. It's already emptied. -Damn! But you know what... Hello? Good thing then, I already mailed it. What about giving me 50 percent? Without me, you would be shot. 15 percent. 15 percent?! No... Okay. -Anton Widebeck, the piano player! -I recognize you. -How is it going with your music? -Well, you have to follow your dreams. I got the best job. I'm going to write new, cool music for the church. -Are you going far away? -We are going to Stockholm. -I'm going to be in "Sweet Idols". -Wow, are you joking? Neat! -It's going to be so exciting. -Good luck! Now for our final music video. The music is written by eleven year old Moa Widebeck! -Welcome, Moa. Good to see you here! -Thank you. It's fun to be here. Your song is about... It's about doing your thing- -and about singing what you like, and above all, enjoy yourself. And I did. That's good to hear. We tried to help out a bit, and give some advice... Per Arne, Moa is on TV! Let's go! The last music video is "Round and round" with Moa Widebeck! I've got something to sing I'm going to sing it to you When you've got something to say Say it right away When you've got something to be proud of, just sing it out louder If you haven't got a clue I'm going to give it to you It goes round and round and round Like a melody Round and round and round To set you free Round and round and round Like a spinning wheel Round and round and round In harmony I think she is going in the right direction. Round and round and round Like a melody Round and round and round To set you free This is so exciting. Look, the envelope. Soon we are going to find out who has won "Sweet Idols" this year. The prize is sweets, of course. But you also get a time slot to make a recording in a professional studio. And I am pulling the string... Let's see... The winner of this year's competition is Moa Widebeck! Yes! I won, Dad! That's how I won "Sweet Idols". Everyone celebrated like crazy- -and Mom and Dad were so proud they laughed and cried at the same time. And Maja even took out her old drums- -and started a rock group with some other old people. But Alexander was happiest of all, he thought he was going to be rich. But he did arrange for a theatre in Gothenburg to stage Dad's musical. That Mom and I get to sing together- -and that us three get to do what we love most in the whole world- -that was the best thing of all. If I was blind and you could see Is there a place you'd rather be Is there a truth that's always true? A place where skies are always blue And Mom, she was singing like never before. I think she finally found her voice again. Don't you think it's good enough? I believe in what I see The miracles are real I can't touch you right in front of me Like reality Like being free What else is here for me to see? I believe in gravity I believe in all the things I see Right here in front of me Like eternity Like you and me
