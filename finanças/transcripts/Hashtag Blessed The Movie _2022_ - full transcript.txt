It's all just the best parts of people's lives made to look shiny and pretty. Then why does it feel so crappy? We're all the same age, yet they're married and have kids. Jessi... your life feels crappy because you allow your life to feel crappy. You're young and beautiful. What makes you think you're not gonna get married and have a family someday? I uh... I don't know. I guess it just hasn't happened yet. I mean, I work in a movie theater. It's kind of hard to find the love of your life when they're already there on a date. Well, okay. Are you doing anything other than working all the time? I mean, I haven't heard you talk about Chad much lately. Love could be right under your nose, you wouldn't know it. Yeah, Chad? Really? Well, if not Chad, but... You are still together, right? How long's it been since you've been in here cooking and baking? You used to love to do that stuff. Yeah, no. I can't afford to do that. I've got student loans coming out of the wazoo from that stupid business management degree. Microwave burritos are about all I have time for. You know, I heard it on the news, most kids in your generation having to deal with that. In fact, how do you know the same girls you're comparing yourself to isn't having the same struggles? Seriously? You think that Brittany, who just bought a brand new Mercedes is struggling with student loan debt? It's possible. The new way of living is to charge everything, get a loan, lease. Yeah, I just I guess I can't see Brittany racking up a bunch of credit card debt. You say she got a new Mercedes, right? Yeah, and it's pretty gorgeous. Something tells me she didn't buy that outright. I'm thinking she got financing, don't you? What does it even matter? The point is that she is driving this brand-new, gorgeous Mercedes, and I'm out here driving this old, beat up piece of crap! I guess you could say I'm Hashtag Blessed.

Yeah, I'm sorry. I uh, should probably head out anyway. I got a shift coming up I gotta get ready for. Come here. Oh, such a beautiful day today, isn't it? About as beautiful as you. Oh, you're so cute. Well, hello, Miss Jessi! I'm so sorry, Mrs. Thompson, Mr. Thompson. I was not looking where I was going. Oh, that's all right. None of us really know where we're going or what we're doing anyway. Where are you headed in such a hurry? I'm going to work. I'm super late. Don't tell me you left Miss Maribel's without taking some of her cookies for the road? I guess I didn't grab any. Well, it's your lucky day. I just happen to have a few in my purse from when she stopped by this morning! I can't take yours. Oh, don't be silly. I'm sure Harold here can convince her to make a few more. And that's the truth if I ever heard it. Well, thank you. I appreciate it. I should get going, 'cause I'm running late, but it was nice to see you. Oh! Nice to see you darling. Merry Christmas.

Are you hurt? I'm just tired. What did you do? I fell. It happens sometimes when you get old. I wanted to decorate just a little bit more. Just lost my balance. Doc says I was very lucky. Extremely lucky. I'll leave you two to visit. Baby girl, don't cry. You're crying too. I know. It's times like this I stop and think about things. Like how blessed I am to have you. Stop. You're gonna make cry more. I've already cried enough for today. Oh? Stress, the holidays. I'm just... Overwhelmed I guess. Baby girl, I'm so sorry to add stress to your world. Oh, no. The good news is there's always tomorrow. Another chance to make it a good day. I wish it was that easy. Oh, but Jessi, it is. It's not what happens to us... It's how we handle what happens to us. Having a good day is a choice. Hey, will you stay with me just a while? I may need you to go snag me some jello off the cart! Of course, of course. I love you, baby girl. I love you, too. That'll be $14.25. Sorry, I can't find my wallet. Keep trying. I'm sure it's in there somewhere. Oh my... I don't have my wallet. Don't worry, little lady. I'll take care of this. Thank you.

I'm happy to do it. Yeah, I'm just happy to eat something other than microwave burritos. Wow, it's been so long. How have things been at work? I mean, they're going. I work with Ashley, so there's that. Oh, and is she still like she was? Negative as all get-out? Yeah. Is she still like that? Yeah. And I know she's still one of my best friends, but I feel like it's starting to rub off on me, all her clumsiness. I feel like the poster child from Murphy's law. Oh, honey, you can't let other people bring you down. It's important to surround yourself with good vibes. Here. I brought just the thing for you. You didn't have to. No, but I wanted to. This is one of my favorite brands. There are positive affirmations on all of their products to remind you of how lovely you are. Thank you. I don't know what to say. Really, though. Don't let other people bring you down. You're too wonderful and too unique. I mean, that's easier said than done, especially after Chad. I'm kind of glad that's over. It never would've worked anyway. Remind me again how you two got together in the first place? Well, we met on campus and... I don't know, he was cute. He was cute. He said I was unhappy or something like that. Well, are you? Unhappy? Uh, let's talk about something else. Let's talk about your work. Okay. So, I have been writing a lot more lately, and I just published my second novel last month. Oh my gosh. Brittany, that's amazing. Thank you. It feels great. It's so validating having my work read, seen and heard. I love the freedom of it and the ability to write when the inspiration strikes. Yeah, maybe I should have changed my major to English. What did you major in again? I feel like that was forever ago. Earth to Jessi. Oh, business management. Yeah, it's going really well, as you can see. Kind of thought by now I'd be running this big company. I don't know. Pipe dream. Don't get so discouraged. I think you're meant to do bigger and better things. I don't mean to rain on your parade, but I'm currently sitting on 30 grand worth of student loans. I totally get it. The loans sucked the life out of me too. How close are you paying them off? I have a job, not a career, if that's any clue. I feel like I'll never be able to pay 'em off, you know? It'll get better, Jessi. I sure hope so. Here. I was going to wait for Christmas, but I think you could use this now. Merry Christmas, my friend. What's... What's this? This is your new bestie. Well, in addition to me, of course! This is one of my favorite tools to help support my mindset, and it's a part of my self-care routine. Self-care. Sounds fun. I think it'll be a massive help. Thanks. I don't know what to say. It's nothing, darling. I have to go. We should do this more often. Why don't we plan a handful of coffee dates, and that way we can spend some more time together. Yeah, I'd really like that. Good. It's so very important for us to connect and socialize in person, especially as of late. I agree. Thanks Brittany. See you later. Thank you for coming to help me today! It's so much easier with you here. You're welcome. How's your ankle feeling? You know, still hurts a little bit. Much better than it was. That's good to hear. I know how important Christmas is to you. Do you, baby girl? Do you know why? I don't know. I hadn't really thought about it. What I love about it, it's a time of year where people seem to slip into kindness much easier. They generally are just nicer to others. They open their hearts. But don't you think that Christmas has just become this over-commercialized holiday that's just all about trying to make people buy stuff we don't really need? Why in the world would you say that? Don't you think people are kinder around Christmas? I mean, sure, but... I work in customer service, and this time of year's just kind of stressful for me, and I'm tired of all these customer demands, and I hate walking through the mall, seeing all these people flaunt their material items. But baby girl, it's not about material items. It's about giving to, and connecting with, others. You know, it's like creating special memories and moments that we hold onto and cherish all the days of our life. My age, lord knows I don't have many of those in my pocket. What do you mean? Are you sick? Oh, no, baby girl. Don't worry about me. I'm super. Just getting older. You know? Starting to feel it. You scared me. Don't do that. The important thing is you're here. I'm here. Where's your Christmas cheer, my dear? Well, I might have brought a little bit of it just for you. And I brought a little just for you too. I don't have a family of my own yet. No, not yet, but you may someday, and I hope you put their picture in there. Even if I'm not around to see it, it brought much comfort when I bought it. A reminder of what's really important in life. Those that love us. Family. Daddy, I can't wait to see Santa. I wanna tell him about my Christmas wish. What's your wish? I can't tell you. It's a secret. Oh, I'm sure you've got a wonderful wish, but I think Santa looks like he's ready to take a picture. I think I know what it is. Oh, me too. The puppy. The puppy. You okay, baby girl? You thinking about your mom and dad? Yeah. I miss 'em. Me too. You're my family, Nana. I love you, and I don't know what I'd do without you. I do. You would be baking cookies for the Thompsons across the street! Do you wanna do that? Do you wanna bake something and then decorate while it's in the oven? Absolutely. Let's do it. That's my boss. I have head into work. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'll be right here. I'll try not to fall. That's not funny, and you know it. Why are you smiling? I love you. I love you too. Hey, Jessi. What are you doing here? Boss called me in. Do you know where she is? She's in the projection room. Hi. Oh, yes. Hello. You need me to cover someone's shift today? No, actually, that's not why I called you here. Look, if this is about the Christmas tree thing that happened the other day, I promise it'll never ever happen again. No, I need to talk to you about something else. Oh. So, I'm sorry to have to call you in on your day off, but there really is no other way to do this. Despite the fact that the holiday season proves to be busy, we're letting you go. You're no longer a match for us. You can collect your things from the locker now. And... happy holidays.

Jessi and I were just trying to decide which cookie recipes to put in our book! You guys are writing a cookbook? Well it's about time! Isn't that the truth? Hard part is, which one makes it? It's so sad. Why don't you put them all in there? You know what? Fine. All the cookies can go in the book. So when are you gonna publish this book? Well, if I had my way, it'd be tomorrow, 'cause I'm getting older by the minute. Oh, pfft! What's in the box? Something special? Yes. The children at the hospital made something for you. These are amazing. Miss Maribel, you have touched the hearts of all of us. You sure have. Hon, we need to get going. Let's let them get back to work. You can't leave yet. Not without these. You are going to spoil him! Come on, I'll get the jackets. And Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hi, love. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! How's your grandma? She's good. She's out here somewhere. Probably talking to the Thompsons. How are you? I'm doing amazing. I've got so much to tell you. How about you? How are you? I'm doing okay. Just okay? Could we actually... Could we get together tomorrow? Yeah, I'd love to. Great. I'll send you a text, okay? Okay. Perfect. All right. Well I've got to go find my other half. Tell Mark I said hi. I will. Bye.

Girl, I'm happy to see you. Me too. I've been feeling a bit off lately. I always feel so much better when we visit. I feel the same way. You want me to get you a coffee? Oh, I've got it. No, I've got this one. What do you want? Peppermint mocha? Just a hot tea. Just a hot tea? Yeah. Okay. Can I just get a hot tea and a black coffee please? Yes. Thank you. I love what you wearing. You look so cute. Look at your hat. You look adorable. Thank you. I thought I'd try something new. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. I'm gonna get sugar. Okay. Hey. I don't know if you remember me, from the movie theater? You had that candy cane in your hair. Yeah, I remember you. Well, I've seen you in here a few times. Decided I better not chicken out the next time that I do, so now here I am. I saw you again. It kind of felt like fate... maybe. Oh, really? Yeah, really. I'm Alexander. You are? Jessi. It's nice to meet you, Alexander. Well, I know we just met and everything, but I'd love to meet you here again sometime, get to know you, if you're open to that. Yeah, I'd like that. I should probably get back to my friend, but I can give you my number. Your friend. And it's Jessi with an I. Okay. I like that. My grandma's nickname for me was Alexi, with an I. But nobody else gets to know that. I look forward to getting to know you, Alexander. Me too. What was that about? What? Oh, I just gave my number to Mr. Alexander. That's his name! I've been curious.

Oh, I'm actually so glad we set up these little chats. I don't really talk to anyone else. Yeah. I'll always be there for you. Thank you. I'm seriously so grateful for you. I'm kind of dealing with something big right now. Good big? Yeah. Okay, well, spill it. Come on, tell me. Okay. I'm pregnant. Oh my gosh! Brittany, that's amazing! I'm so happy for you! What did Mark say? He doesn't know yet. Well, have you guys talked about kids before? Yeah. And what did he say? He wasn't sure. He said he wanted to be a dad, but he wasn't sure that he was going to be a good one. Well, you know what this means though, right? Don't make me guess. You gotta get him excited. Show him what a good dad he'll be. You really think so? Absolutely. You and I both know how amazing he's gonna be. You're right, but I just... I don't know how to tell him, and I just can't figure it out. That's what I'm here for. Look, we can look on Pinterest, find some cute baby reveal ideas, and I'll help you get everything you need, and then you can set it up for him before he gets home today. Thank you so much. I'm so glad you're here. I could never do this alone. I got you. Okay, let's look. Thanks for coming with me to do all of that. Of course. I had so much fun, and Mark is gonna be surprised, and you gotta text me and send me pictures, okay? Oh, you know, I will. I can't wait till he gets home. We didn't get to talk about what's going on with you though. I'm so curious. No, honestly, it's totally okay. We can talk about it next time we visit. Maybe I did wanna tell you one thing though. What? What? Did you get a new job? Tell me. No, no, no. I... I kind of wanna spend some more time doing something creative, so... My grandma and I are doing a cookbook. Oh my gosh! That is amazing. I can't wait to hear more. And if you need any help or anything, I am a published author. Seriously, if you have any questions at all, I'm here. Thank you. Oh, I should probably go. Oh, yes. No, go, go, go! Go see Mark! Pregnancy brain must be setting in early. Thank you for letting me in on this. Of course. Okay, drive safe. Precious cargo. Do you cook? You have to now. Try those cookies on page two. They're wonderful. Thank you for coming. And who am I making this one out to? I suspect you may have some idea, Jessi. Sa... Santa? Well, that is what they call me. But you, Miss Maribel, can call me Nick. Well... Okay, Nick. Would it be too forward for a lady to offer to buy you a glass of wine? Miss Maribel! Well, I do have to keep my senses, but perhaps some hot cocoa and marshmallows. Cocoa and marshmallows it is! What are we waiting for? Tell me, what do you do in your off time? Well, since 2020, I'm a dog walker now. Oh my gosh! Hey! Hey! Still need a signature. Okay. Okay, who was that guy? Just an old friend. Well, this is the last one from your bedroom. Thanks. Can you take this one too? Yeah, sure. Are you ready? I couldn't be more ready. Well, I'm glad I can help. Me too. Can you imagine my Nana trying to carry these boxes? I don't underestimate what she can do, but I'm glad I can help. If you need a minute, I'll be waiting in the car, okay? Okay. Who knew we'd make it to this day? I'm really grateful for you.
