Nailed Tyre Repair Oh, get inside! I'm not done yet. Where are you going? Bloody hell! Slow Down Construction Site Ahead I told you it's twice the gas if we take another road. - I'm telling you! - Hey! You guys are killing us! You should compensate me! - What compensation? - Never mind. - Let me talk to the manager. - You're crazy. - Who's in charge? - What's wrong with you? Manager! - Where's the manager? - Call the police! Where are you going? OK, I'll stay put... - Hey! - Manager! - Where's the manager? - What's going on? Where do you think you're going? - I just want to talk. - Talk to me. Talk to me. - You can talk to me, sir! - Wait. Hey! Da-eul! - Da-eul! - Man, it hurts. - What's a child doing here? - Da-eul. Are you OK? - Who's that man? - Sorry, ma'am. - We'll get him out immediately. - The owner? I own the auto repair shop over there. - Will you let go? - Get out of here! Pick him up! Hey, look! I own the auto shop and I can't live like this! Let me go! Are you treating me like this because I'm not from around here? Dragging me here like a dog and writing me up? Look, Mr Kim. What I'm saying is they got the permit and paid for the damages. You can't just go there and make a scene. They settled with the head of the residents' association, not me! Why did they get paid for my damages? I've said this umpteen times. That's because you wouldn't listen to them. You wouldn't be in this mess if you had taken up their modest offer. Hell... Hell? Did you just curse at me? All I said was "hell". Look here. You can't blame the construction for your bad business. Right. Just tuck your tail between your legs and join the association! You might get some business from the locals. Besides people say your father-in-law is selling the land the auto shop is on. Who the hell said that? - What? - You'd better watch your language. "The accused verbally assaulted" "the police officer twice." Sheesh. Hello, you're here again. Be nice to him or he'll file a complaint. That grocery guy asked when you're coming. Tell him to scrap the truck. Tell him to wait! Shoot. This freaking village is... killing me. Man, this is ridiculous. Mr Mun, you here! I thought you said you'd be a while. M-Mr Kim. Someone said I should scrap the truck. What do you think? Replace a few valves and you'll get a few more years out of it. Val... Mr Mun. Someone said it's the valve or something. Or I think it could be something you'd buy for comfort to go under a jacket. A black coral is a good choice. Chequered pattern was the trend last year. This dress looks pretty for any occasion. A royal blue or a regular blue or a black one. There are three colours to choose from. Hello, I'd like to cancel the order I just made. I don't think I cancel that often. Got it. Just cancel it, please. Thank you. Where were you? Nowhere. Did your dad tell you to vacate this place? I don't know. I think they got a complaint that we haven't paid tax. Hey, why didn't you tell me that? I figured we'd get some business. What business? The whole village is walking on eggshells because of him. Is that my fault? Why are you nagging at me? You said we should move here! Ma'am, this beer and a pack of Esse, please. Pardon? Esse. Esse! Cigarettes! Ma'am... Which cigarette is the cheapest? The cheapest cigarette! The cheapest one! OK. I'll put the beer back. Crap. Jeez, you little brat! You startled me. - It's bed time. - I'm going to bed now. This is for you. Don't get cute. Wait until your grandma finds out. No, she said it was OK. - Really? - Really. She said this is for taking me to school the other day. I guess... I should drink it? I'm going to bed. - Enjoy your beer. - Sure. Aren't you too old for that little girl? Hey, no one wants to play with you? Where do you think you're going? Hey, scumbag. You'd better watch your bloody mouth. I warned you that I'd kill you if you take my business. What the heck are you looking at? Bozo, you want a piece of me? You piece of crap. - Get over here! - You piece of crap! - Come on! - Let go! Gosh. - Put this on. Here. - I got it. We can't let this happen. - The association has to step up! - Of course! That moron from Seoul sure knows how to throw a punch. See what he did to my Yong-seok's face. Here. Here we go. I wonder why they don't have a kid yet. The granny at the store said Sun-yeong had some problem. It's not that. - The schmuck shoots blanks. - Really? Sun-yeong's father said that his seedless grapes ruined her life. Unbelievable! So the dumb girl married him just for his looks? Bloody frigging buzz-kill. Mr Mun! W-What's the matter? Boss... Boss! - What's... - Boss, come on now! Woman, I told you to watch your tongue! How many times have I said that? - What did I do? - Shut it! He's going to shut this place down. I told you he still has feelings for her! What a creep. But still, it's Father's birthday. Shouldn't your husband be here? He'd have to be insane to come here. The way you always gang up on him! Well, look at you. Standing up for your darling husband. Why choose him over a decent guy like Yong-seok? He's a disgrace. You can't even pay for electricity! Yong-seok? Call him Mr Mun! Or call him the head of the association. Come on, stop it! - I'm so sick of this! - You stop it! Anyway, you vacate the auto shop and move back in with us this month! Got it? This doesn't look good. - Totally ruined. - How long will this take? I have to work tomorrow, so... Yes. I'll be done in around 30 minutes. Was that stuck in the tyre? A lot of construction trucks pass by here. They probably dropped it. In fact, I'm sure it's them. We could have gotten into a big accident. You should report this to the county office and get compensated for it. Not many cars come this way because of those schmucks. And my business is in the toilet. Good as new. How much do I owe you? Yes, it's $250 a side. So $500 in total. Hey, how could a tyre cost $250? Well, you said it's urgent so I declined an on-site job for it. You're just ripping me off. - This is... - Sweetie, let's just go. It's a long way to Seoul. I'll knock $70 off if you pay cash. Drive safe. Please come again! - Thanks for the ride, Brother. - Sure. - Bye! - Bye. Oh, hello... What are you doing out here? That's just ridiculous. When someone says hi you should at least act like you noticed. Maybe he didn't see you. I was here, and he was there. - And... - Then why don't you go punch him? - What? - What do you want me to do? I'm caught in between! That's not what I'm saying. Dad told me to pay the bill before people start talking. Wait. Pay with this. I had a customer. Maybe bought... twice only... Honey. Honey! - What? - Honey! - What? - Wake up! We have a customer. A customer? Hurry up. The county officer got a flat tyre. A flat tyre? Hello. I don't have a spare tyre in the car boot. OK, I'll take a look. Please hurry. A plug won't do the job. This tyre is completely ruined. You'll need new tyres. Might as well. You know you have to replace tyres in pairs, right? It's done. I left the old intact tyre in the boot as spare. How much is it? $80 per side, so $160 in total. But for you, just $150. $150? Then you won't be making any money. Oh, a special price for you. Since you work for the county office. Thank you then. Wait a second. All right, here's $200! Wow, thank you, sir. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, sir. Come back any time. Give me that. What kind of a public servant carries around that much cash? I saw a lot of cash in his car. Maybe he's collecting his dues. I'm hungry. Feed me. What do you want to eat? Anything. Anything what? Do you want meat? We don't have any. - Just something simple. - Simple it is. Got it. Hey, slow down. You might fall. That's odd. What are you doing there? Wondering why we're not getting more clients. We already had two today. I know, but... That's strange. What the... Where's the rest? Those schmucks. Always getting in the way. Aren't you going to sleep? No, I'm not sleepy. - Come inside. - OK. Oh my! Shoot. Scared me. What are you doing? Are you crazy? You must be out of your mind. What if someone got into a big accident? Just go pick them up. Don't worry. I have a plan. Are you trying to get arrested? - Show me... - Hey. Why should I go to jail? Jail? Hey, you know I reported Officer Park for taking bribes. I also filed complaints about the golf course damaging the green belt. Did they go to jail? Hey, let's be honest. Most of the cars that come in for repair belong to tourists. What does that mean? They have no problem making a living at all. Nothing wrong with ripping off rich people a little. Hey... ouch! I barely make $200 a month. Look. Just until we buy this place. Just help me until we can buy this place. Sun-yeong. I'll be careful not to get caught. Boar Crossing Speed Limit 60km Have a good day. Boar Crossing Speed Limit 60km The county governor wants to have dinner with us. It's obvious he wants a bribe. The chauffeur? His aunt passed away. It's OK, I'm driving. Honey, don't forget to pick up Da-eul later. Two hours? I can't wait two hours! What? What? The weekend? So what? I don't care. I can't wait that long. So, hurry. Done yet? I think she's in a hurry. OK. The bloody car jack. Breaking down at a busy time like this. How long would it take? Man, I'm so dusty! Tell her to go somewhere else. Give us a minute, please. Are you crazy? She's paying double. Go fix it. Would you like something cold to drink? It's hot. Excuse me. You have an air-conditioner here? No, but we have a fan. I can turn it on. No, thanks. How much do you get paid for that? $0.05 for ten. I'll buy one. Call it a day. It's too hot. $10 How much is it? It's $2,600. $2,600? Why? Something wrong? How could it be $2,600 for changing two tyres? You said you were going to pay double if I fix your car first. It's $900 for two tyres. I also fixed the bearing. That's $1,300 including miscellaneous expenses. Double that... Yeah, it's $2,600, lady. Look. Well, aside from the tyres what was wrong with the bearing? Shouldn't you have told me what was wrong before fixing it? You have no common sense. How about I put everything back and you take your car somewhere else? Whatever. I'll pay, OK? We don't take credit cards. - What? - We don't have the machine. We only take cash. No way. Thank you, lady. You're stuck in this crap hole because you pull this kind of crap. Go to hell, you bloody... Honey. Yeah? Drink this. Here. Why are you being so nice to me? What do you mean? - Honey. - Yeah? How long would we have to do this to live like that woman? Who? The woman driving the Benz today. You want to live like her? Just wait. We'll buy this place first. How much longer do I have to wipe your butts? Take care of your business. Use your head. Your head! Sorry, Boss. Make something up at the town meeting. Yes, Boss. What should I tell them about the money? Make up something! A charity donation or whatnot. Must I tell you how to do everything? I told you, I got this. What if you get injured like the last time? We'll lose $1,000 a day. Gosh. I knew it wasn't me you were worried about. No, I do worry about you. Why do you always do this here? There's another road back there and over there too. That road is going downhill. People could get seriously hurt. Shine the light here. What? Honey, what if we nail them in instead of doing this every time? Then they wouldn't get swept away by the trucks. How do you nail something here? The surface is too hard. I mean long nails would work. Don't be dumb. Should I try though? See? You can't do this without me. You're right about that. Honey, there's a car coming! Hide them! Hey, I worked so hard to make those! Hurry... hurry! What if they saw us? What is that? The moon? Right, it's the moon. Hey, Mr Kim. What are you doing here at this hour? - Hello. - Hi. Are you stealing something from the field? Not at all. He lost his wallet around here, so... - That's right. - Is that so? Should I shine my car lights over there? - Sure... - No! No! - No... - No. We've already looked. We were just going to leave. Why? We can help you. Was there a lot of money in it? No, there wasn't much in it. No use looking for it. Mr Kim, what's that behind you? - What? - What's behind you? No, there's nothing behind me. By the way, where have you been? There was a family gathering, you know? Right... Oh! A family gathering's a personal matter. You went in your cop car? You even used it for grocery shopping? W-Why are you picking on me all of a sudden? No, I'm not picking on you. Nice. And why are you such a blabbermouth? We're leaving. Just go home. - Good night, Officer. - Good night. - Drive safe! - Bye. Pick them all up! - Are you up? - Yeah. I'm so tired from staying up late. This is all I get for gluing googly eyes for three stinking months. Buy cigarettes with this. What's the matter? You love money too much to be giving it to me. Like I'd be satisfied with that pathetic sum? By the way, no customers today? We cleared the road because of Officer Park. Maybe we got scared for nothing. We should lie low for a couple days. You're right. I'll go get my hair done then. OK, good idea. Why don't you cheer up and go get yourself some beer? Beer. Ma'am! - She's asleep. - Uncle. Eun-mi, what are you doing? I smell sweaty, don't I? Hold on. We're almost there. My dad smelled like you. He did? What a perfect day for ice dessert! Right? Yeah! It's your first time here after coming back? Yes. Don't you get bored sitting at home? Come to town more often. I will from now on. Why don't you get a conditioning treatment? I'll give you a discount. It'll just be $80 in total. That's cheap. I'll go for it. Well, OK. What's the occasion, Boss? Nothing. He was whining about the slow business. Goodness gracious. This town will fall apart without you. It seems Kim's auto shop is on a roll. - You mean Mr Kim? - Yes. What are you talking about? He used to buy from us on credit but he came in yesterday and cleared his debt. What? How did he get the money? I don't know about that. And he made a huge order too. Gee. Speak of the devil. Did you hear the old man from the gas station was sent to a nursing home? Our association paid for his hospital bills. How great! Boss! You should run for the provincial election. No need for installments, just one payment. When will it be delivered? OK, bye. Thanks. You're home. Wow, your hair. Fabulous. Just fabulous. - Is it too curly? - It's dazzling. - Oh, what's this? - I had some in town. It was very good, so I brought some home. I took Eun-mi there today. I told you not to play with her. Dad nags at me about it. There you go again. I give Eun-mi a ride when I want. It's none of your family's business. But think about it. You never take our nephews on rides... They have their parents for that. Well, Eun-mi isn't an orphan. She has her grandmother. No, it's not about you. No, it's not. Let's have this. Let's eat. I really wanted an ice dessert. Please find my daughter. Please find my daughter! When did you last see her? It's too loose. Can't you drill it in like you would on a wall? Then it might work. You need a screw anchor for that and it'd be noticeable. You're right. Should I try anyway? See? You can't tell. No one can see it. It's harder than I thought. I should bring a bigger drill next time. - Should I got get it now? - No... Let's just use this for now. I'm from Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. Have you found anything? We could have tracked down the bills if you had come to us before handing over ransom. What's done is done. What's your plan now? Since your wife runs the company we're looking into business-related people. Ma'am, can you think of anyone who might have a grudge against you? Or were there any big transactions of money? I can't think of anyone who might have a grudge. But I run a big business. We've had several big transactions. Mrs Lee, bring me my purse. Here. I think we need to get a safe. - A safe? - Yeah. We can't keep our money like this. You're right. Or should we just empty that kimchi jar and use it? Then the money will smell like kimchi! Being rich has its problems too. Honey. May I splurge a little? On what? I saw this dress on a shopping channel but the sale is over. Are you kidding? Get ten of them. Really? It'll be so expensive to buy it in a store. Go ahead and buy it! Don't you need anything? Nothing. I don't need anything until I buy this place. But... we don't have any evidence against him. We can't just arrest him. If he files a complaint it'll be a lot of trouble for everyone. Let's just bring Mr Kim here while we check the security cameras. Chief, I know it's him. He used to borrow money left and right and now suddenly he could pay everything off? And he was lurking around late at night... Which day was it now? Didn't I say we should think this over before leaving the house? Why don't you ever think? OK, let's just get back inside. It's raining too hard. Come on, this is nothing. You have no idea. It could cause a big accident. We'll be done for then. We need to look at the big picture. So, what do you want to do? Go back home? What if it stops raining? OK, for now let's go home and maybe come back later. We don't have the luxury of skipping work just because of bad weather! Why are you getting annoyed? You go home. I'll do it by myself. Shut it. Don't be stupid. Sun-yeong! What's going on here? Did Mr Kim lose his wallet again? Mr Kim, you need to come with us. Why? Hey, don't you know why? What's this about? - Honey! - Sun-yeong! Honey! Just read him the Miranda rights! Let's go! My goodness! What do I do? What? Since you're surprised, you must know them. Are you going to say you don't know them? T-The director of the resort... Director, and who else? Who? This kid. I-I don't remember... Are you frigging kidding me? Hey. You saw Mrs Cho's daughter at the construction site. Why didn't you tell me Mrs Cho fixed her car at your auto shop? R-Right, that was the day. Now you remember. OK, let's... wrap this up soon so we can get some sleep. Got it? Mr Kim. There's nothing there. - Check over there. - Yes, sir. Well done. - Search the place thoroughly. - Yes, sir. We have cops searching our house because of that bozo? Moron. Dad, stop it. Please ask them why they took him. Haven't I been shamed enough? Why don't you ask them if you're so curious? They won't tell me. Why won't you help? He's your son-in-law! He's no son of mine! You're my little girl and he got you pregnant! Not that again! Why did you let me marry him then? I wouldn't have if you hadn't lied to me about the pregnancy! I wanted to kill you! I was pregnant. I had a miscarriage! How many times have I told... You shut up! We'll wrap it up. Did you check all the security cameras? Yes, we've checked the car cameras of all the vehicles on the way to Mrs Cho's mansion. How about his alibi? It checks out and there's nothing unusual in his house either. He did start spending more recently but it started before the kid went missing and this is the busiest time of the year they say. Any possible accomplices? His only sibling lives in the Philippines. He has no relatives here. I spoke with his ex-colleagues in Seoul. But nothing suspicious there. Are you heading home? I'll give you a ride. Have a cigarette. Go ahead. Thank you. It's been tough on you, huh? Do you know why I volunteered to come here? I thought it'd be easier to climb the ladder in a peaceful countryside like here than in a rat race in the big city. But the reality is... the people here just openly ostracised me. Isn't this twisted? Half the town is related to the brothers Officer Park and Mr Mun. How long do you think it will take to make it in this town? I'm just... hanging in there. Like you, Chief Min. R-Right. I'm hanging in there, and so are you. We're in the same boat. My goodness. Poor you, Mr Kim. Listen. You're old enough to know better. Hey, Mr Kim. This is why you're getting trampled on by those dumb brothers! If you don't have connections or anything you just stay quiet, OK? Stop making trouble for busy folks like us! Got it? Mr Kim! Stay out of my sight from now on, yeah? Good night. Honey... honey! What happened? Did we get caught? Did we? Say something! That's all you have to say after I was dragged away like a dog? You look haggard. Are you hungry? Wait a minute. Forget it. I'm not hungry. What did they say? - Why did they come here? - I don't know. Didn't the police say anything? Stop talking about police! I've had enough of them! W-Why are you yelling? I'm just worried. They asked me about the day the resort director came and the day after. And then they set me free. Enough? Honey! I said you should get some sleep. I didn't work for days. It's all money to be made. Gosh, you're soaked. Are you seriously going out tonight? Of course I am. Come on. Do you want to get caught again? What? What's wrong? What is it? Are you OK? I should slash all the tyres in the village and take over the whole frigging place. You're scaring me. Are you sick? No. Wait here. I bought some ginseng for you. It's not Sun-yeong. Of course she's in on it. Hey, it's not her! You can't catch a kidnapper that easy. What did Chief Min say? He's just anxious to save his own neck as always. Shall I have my boys search for her? Come on, Brother. - If the word gets out, I'll be fired. - Why? It's a top-secret investigation. The state department even sent someone. Top secret. Here's the plan. What plan? You and I will take turns watching him. Watching him? There goes another one. I'd rather it was raining. It's so hot. Why are all the cars just passing by today? Oh, my back. Shoot! Bloody hell... I think we can get back out there now. I want to do it too but... How about this? Division of roles. If you get caught again we'll have to quit and starve. The thought of it gives me the chills. Isn't that scary? Eat the meat first. - OK. - Here. - Were you hungry? - Yeah. I'm constantly hungry these days. Eat up then. Honey, I did the maths and we had 16 cars today. Isn't that awesome? No wonder I was so busy today. - Do you have ox bone soup? - Yes. Honey. That's the customer from the other day. - Right? - Stop staring and eat. - What a thing to do. - What? How could anyone do this? I wonder where they hid her. What's happening to this neighbourhood? I could take the bus. But you're ill. And I'll get more exercise driving you. That way I'll get to be with you longer. - Oh my goodness! - You all right, honey? You must have been shocked. I brought some pills. This will help. If it's true, we need to do something. We didn't get hurt because I was driving slowly but someone else could've been seriously hurt! Yes, exactly. We've filed complaints, but nothing has changed. How dare they ruin a road like this just to save some money? They must be insane! Heaven will punish them! Here. Do you remember I used to dye your fingernails with balsam? - What are you looking at? - What? The balsam flowers are in full blossom here. - Why don't you take some... - No, it's OK. They're living things too. We should let them be. Look who's here. What did you buy? Got your period? Have I got the date right? What a lowlife. You should try to act your age. Going home? Not stopping by the hardware store? Should I tell my staff to order more concrete nails? You're wondering why I'm keeping quiet about it? Come see me if you want to know. I'll tell you. But it's up to you. Why aren't you sleeping? I'm just thinking. About what? Well... the old couple from earlier asked for a discount. They were going to the hospital for dialysis. Did you give them a discount? Are you crazy? I charged the full price. You had me wondering. But after they left, I thought of my parents. Get some sleep. We'll be busy tomorrow. Good night. Honey. What if someone knows what we're doing but hasn't reported it to the police? - What should we do then? - What? What are you talking about? You think someone knows? I'm just saying, what if. What if, you know? You scared the crap out of me! If that happens, we should stop. How are we going to make a living then? Don't jinx this. Go to sleep! You won't feel a thing. It weighs only 180 grams. It's surprisingly light to carry. The colour stands out too. This is the brown one right here. This is the black version. These two are the same except for the leather part here. Black and brown here. For the green ones it's green only for the part that's been sewn. It's so amazingly light. The ones on the market are heavy. And aren't the colours pretty? It's perforated in there. That took out a lot of weight. Because of that they are super light. Do you worry that it's less sturdy because it's perforated? Don't worry. If you look at the bottom it's full of many tiny spikes... Gosh, who's this? - It's Sun-yeong! - It's been a while. How could you ignore my calls and not come to our reunions? - You're going somewhere? - Yeah, downtown. Ja-gyeong's giving us a treat. Did you hear she married into the Shin Pharmacy family? - I've heard. - You should come too. She's always saying how much she misses you. Let's go together. Follow us on your scooter. OK? It'll be fun. You startled me! When did you get here? - Brother! - What's wrong with your face? - Are you all right? - Do I look all right? Why didn't you answer the phone? You called? How could you? I almost died doing what you told me to do. Lower your voice. They're talking behind my back about us. So, why didn't you keep your promise? I reported to you every hour! Look. - Just tell me the truth. - Tell you what? You did it, right? You're acting all shady and evasive... No way. Are you trying to take it all without me? It's not that. What about my bloody promotion? "Bloody" promotion? Who the heck do you think you are? You think I'm your buddy? How dare you take that attitude with me? You're so violent. See you. Hey! Where were you all day? What's that? You told me to buy anything I want. Yeah, that's just great. I was too busy to eat all day so I'm eating ramen now. New hairdo? Splendid. Are you out of your mind? Yeah, so don't provoke me. What? Sun-yeong? Sun-yeong, what are you doing? Are you still in the shower? Did you fall asleep in there? Man, it's a steam sauna in there. What's with that in this hot weather? Hey, what's this doing here? I cleaned the bathroom floor with it. What? Don't you know how toxic this is? You should've opened the door at least. What was she thinking? It's a nice day. You've been living here long? About five years. You're not from here, right? No, I'm from Seoul. I knew it from the way you talk. You should come here often. What's that? Did someone crash their car? - Honey, hurry! - It's a car accident! A car crashed into the rice paddy! Sir! It's a misunderstanding! It's not what you think! This is where the kidnapped girl, Song Da-eul was rescued an hour ago by local resident, Kim Jae-gu. The kidnapper turned out to be the county officer of Construction Department who was in charge of the administration of the resort construction by the company that the victim's mother runs. During the police interview the kidnapper stated that he spent more than $2 million on illegal gambling. - Fetch the governor a drink. - OK. Tell the kids to be quiet. Hell... What's that rag you're wearing? Man, what a difference a day makes, right? But still, your dad has no shame. Cut him some slack. This is his only chance to have drinks with the governor. Still, has he no pride fawning over the governor like that? Can you tell us what Kim Jae-gu is like? Of course. So, my son-in-law is very... He's very prudent... and good-looking. Land Contract This is ridiculous. Are you kidding me? There's no way we're paying this much! What are you talking about? Hey! He's been in the business for 30 years... Forget it! We're not buying it. $70,000? The land is hardly worth $30,000. Are you crazy? Hey, don't get upset. We can talk and find a solution. Right, Jae-gu? - OK, let's make a deal. - What? I'll pay half today and the rest by next month. Let's just buy another plot of land. Gee. OK. - What are you doing? - Stop making a fuss. Hey, your father wouldn't con his daughter just to make some money. He's not some scheming lowlife. What I'm about to show you is number one among compact cars and the interior is... How do I look? You look great. Come this way! - All the way to the end. - I did. Five! Tyre Repair Big Fortune Auto Shop Big Fortune Auto Shop What do you mean you don't have any stock? It's true. Mr Kim bought out everything. - Hell. - I'll get it to you by next week. Bloody hell! You said that last week. Sorry, sir. We have customers. - I'll call you later. - Hey... Hey. Hello? Hey! Bloody hell... Dialling: Lee Sun-yeong The person you called is unavailable. Please... It feels a bit... - Doesn't fit? - No, too tight. Excuse me. It's the wrong size. Such cheapskates. Those rich people. A measly $50,000 for saving their kid? But it feels good to get paid for doing nothing. Ever since we ordered the expensive wine look. That man has been standing there since. Right? Order anything you want. You wanted to splurge, right? - Want more wine? - Shall we? Yes? - One more of this. - Yes, sir. - Honey? - Yes? Are we going to stay here? What do you mean? You bought the land knowing it was way overpriced. You really don't know your man. I know you want to live in Seoul. Just hang in there for three more years. I'll buy you a nice little building in the suburbs of Seoul. Whatever. I'm not fooling around here. I have it all planned out. An auto shop on the first floor. We'll rent out the second floor and we'll live on the third floor. How about that? Deal? That sounds great. Deal. Let's drink to that! Cheers. Yes, Seoul. Once I move, I could put it all behind me. - That's strange. - What's wrong? There was a car idling for a while so I went over, thinking it's got a flat tyre. It just took off. This makes you so happy? How can I call myself an auto shop owner when I don't have a car? It was so humiliating. You're right. Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am! Eun-mi got hit by a car! Mr Kim Myung-ho. You got your licence five years ago but started driving only recently. Why did you cut the wheel? Look, I heard a loud pop and the car spun of control. - It's true. - We'll look into it. Anyway, you're very lucky. Surviving an injury like this? Heaven's on her side. You don't have any priors? Of course not. Boss, here! - Boss, you're here. - Yeah. The head of the ladies' association is here. Already? Crap. Park the car. Hey, what the hell are you doing here? Get lost! What are you looking at? Go away! I'm not in the mood. Leave me alone. What? Crap. Hey. You just run along home and puncture tyres. Understand? What if someone knows what we're doing but hasn't reported it to the police? What should we do then? Hey, you startled me! It's too late at night to be honking! We'll never make it to Seoul at this rate. Come on, let's work. Honey, what's wrong? Open the door! Honey! Are you insane? Tearing up the land deed? - Give it to me! - What's wrong? - Now. - Are you crazy? Darn it! - What are you doing? - It's because of this. - Don't! Stop! - It's OK... Don't! Lunatic! You lunatic! You piece of crap! Stop! - It's OK. - You schmuck! - It's OK. - Leave it! - Hey! - Leave it! - I said, leave it! - It's not too late. - Let's burn this. - Hey, leave it! - Leave it! - Sun-yeong! Sun-yeong, wake up! Sun-yeong! Sun-yeong! Please. We are human. Human? Human, my foot. You have no idea what I did to make all this money! Don't say it. Don't say it! - Don't say it! - Let me go! Let go! Hey! A simple plug won't fix this. Don't you get it? What's done is done. So, let's just make more money. OK? Big Fortune Auto Shop We nailed so bloody many of these...
