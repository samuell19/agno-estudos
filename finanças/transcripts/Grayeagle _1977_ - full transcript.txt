[WOMAN HUMMING] [DOGS BARKING] [CONTINUES HUMMING] [GROWLING] [WIND WHISTLING] [HORSE NEIGHING] Well, you'd better set another plate. Standing Bear's back. Looks like he has fresh meat, too. One shot, Standing Bear? [LAUGHS] We're thankful for the meat. He's got a whitetail deer. Run across any other hunting parties out there? Young Cheyenne already moved south to hunt the spring herd of elk and buffalo. Well, we've been worried about you. You've been out three days. What's the matter? You losing your touch? Whitetail is still fast, and smart as always. So is the beaver and mink. But it could be you and I might be getting a little older, too. I'll help skin the deer. I'll let you take the arrow out, too. But she's a damn good cook. Like her mother, though, she never had much stomach for skinning and trapping game. [HORSE NEIGHS] He must have followed you. No one followed me. Is he Cheyenne? Too far. Could be Shoshone or Crow. Fetch my gun from the cabin. He dresses for battle. I know. That's what's bothering me. Whoever he is, he's up to no good. Come on down! Come on down! Looks like a Cheyenne to me. No reason for him to be this far north. He knows he's out of gun range. Put the horses in the corral. It's getting dark fast, and I got a feeling that's what he's waiting on. [NEIGHING, HUFFING] Sometime before morning, he's liable to try and take them horses. STANDING BEAR: It has to be Cheyenne. Could mean a small war party. What do you suppose they want? If it's horses, we'll know soon. If it's scalps, we'll know with the morning light. Standing Bear, go feed the horses. I just don't understand it. I ain't seen a Cheyenne this far north in more than two years. Well, let's go to work. Standing Bear! Get Colter. [INDISTINCT] It will be light soon. I just can't figure him out. You sleep awhile, I'll watch. No, I'll be all right. But I don't intend to spend another sleepless night over that Indian. If he don't show himself by morning, I figure I'll find him one way or the other. Standing Bear, I figure you'd better work your way along the western edge of that rise in front of the cabin. I'm going on over the top of that ridge and get in that ravine. Do you think he will show when sun sets again? I don't know, but I'm through trying to outguess him. If I can just get close enough to him today... I don't guess we ever will know what was on his mind. You stay inside. If you need it, use it. And bolt the door. [GASPS] [SCREAMING] [BETH CONTINUES SCREAMING] Take the back, Standing Bear. Beth! Beth! Colter! He took her. He's smart, and this ain't gonna be easy. It will soon be dark. We cannot track Cheyenne after dark. Maybe not, but we are gonna try now, ain't we? We'll split up. I'll head north along the river. If I don't pick up his track or catch him before I get to the fort, I'll wait for you there. [BETH CRYING] No, please! No! [SOBBING] Please let me go! Please. Please let me go! Please let me go! Please let me go! Please. Please let me go. I'll give you $4, a jug of whiskey and two of them... I mean, one of them sacks of flour over there. Two jugs of whiskey and three sacks of flour. What do you mean, two jugs of whiskey? Why, them three sacks of flour are worth all them mangy hides you brought in here last winter. Hmm. -Hi, Abe. -Hi, John. What the hell are you doing here so early in the morning? You must've rode all night. Well, I needed to get here by daylight. I'm running late now. You seen Standing Bear? No. Am I supposed to have seen him? I figured he'd beat me here. There's something wrong, ain't it? I'm gonna be needing a fresh horse, Abe. Now that ain't what I asked you. You didn't come in here this early for supplies. Yeah, there's something dead wrong, Abe. A young Cheyenne come in the back door of my cabin and got Beth. They got her? Well, there ain't no Cheyenne around here, especially this time of the year. Well, that's what me and Standing Bear have been telling one another, but one took her. Any of you fellas seen any young Cheyenne around? All the young ones went south to the Yellowstone to hunt. What part of the Yellowstone? ABE: Where the Madison meets the Missouri, about 50 miles south. That's deep in that basin country. Thanks. Now you two get them furs and take them around and put them in that storeroom 'fore I change my mind. Tom, get that saddle and put it on my horse and bring him around here. Right away, Abe. Hi, Lum. -Hey. -Where do you keep the gunpowder? Over there. Blamed Injuns are getting harder to trade with every year. They just asked me for two jugs of my best whiskey. Give me some of that coffee, Lum. How far upriver before I come to Trapper Willis's place? He's about 35 miles on up the river. You seen him lately? No, he don't come around here much anymore. Well, I'll bring your horse back in a few days. Aw, don't worry about the horse. I wish I could close up and go with you. I hope you find that gal of yourn all right. Just put this on my bill. When Standing Bear gets here, you tell him I couldn't wait, went on upriver to Trapper Willis's place. You tell him when he gets here now to catch up. All right, John. No Cheyenne around. Shoshone camp on river. Devil's Elbow. How many? Maybe eight, maybe 10. Thanks. Ain't thirsty. [BUGLE SOUNDS] Help! Help me! Help me, please. Please help me. Morning, ma'am. Morning. [LAUGHS] Please! Please help me! Help me! One who blows bugle is touched by Great Spirit. You speak English. You speak English! Why haven't you answered me before now? Reason to answer. You ask me what I cannot say. Well, you could tell me where I'm going. You could tell me why you took me from the cabin. You could tell me something! We go. Well, I'm not going! I'm not going. I'm not going. I'm not getting on the horse! I won't! I'm not getting on! Let me go. Cheyenne give up hunting buffalo and elk to take white woman. [ALL LAUGHING] Grayeagle ask Shoshone for lodging only. Do the white man follow for girl? One of our kind is tracking half-day back. Let it be said, the Shoshone gave his brother, the Cheyenne, food and lodging. [YELLS IN SHOSHONE] [MEN LAUGHING] Two... Two best ponies for girl. Trade two fast ponies for girl. Girl not for trade. These two ponies, young, have many hunts left in them. Girl not for trade! [QUIETLY] You've got to get me out of here. You've got to get me home before it's too late. My father's coming to get me, I know he is... Quiet! Eat. Next time, maybe I take ponies. [MEN CHANTING, DRUMMING] So your name's Grayeagle. And you're a Cheyenne too, aren't you? Why'd you take me, Grayeagle? You don't have to do that. By the looks of the scalps in here, I ain't going anywhere. You don't mean me any harm, do you? For some reason, I don't believe you mean me any harm. If you take me back, I promise you that I won't let anybody hurt you for taking me. And that white man that we passed today... Well, he knows that I'm your captive, and the only reason he didn't stop is because he was afraid to. The one who is touched by Great Spirit will say nothing, for he has lived here many years as a Shoshone. [CHUCKLING] I made the whole day good. Yeah. I hope it don't rain, thunder. Ol' Bugler take sick, won't be able to blow the bugle. [LAUGHING] Who's out there? Who's there? Who's out there? Easy does it. I don't mean you no harm. You scared ol' Bugler. How long have you been camped here? Since dark. You wouldn't mind if I have some of them beans? Ol' Bugler cooks 'em up good. [LAUGHING] Where are you from? From? I live upcreek with the Shoshone. Do they say you're touched by the Great Spirit? That's it. Touched by the Great Spirit. You seen a Cheyenne buck with a white girl today? You heard me, didn't ya? I asked you about a white girl. The girl, where'd you see her? I ain't even seen a crow in the sky all day, not even a crow. You hear me, and you hear me good. Now one more time, have you seen a Cheyenne buck with a white girl today? Upcreek, about midday. Was she all right? How close did you get? Not close. Ol' Bugler scared. She was with a Cheyenne, wasn't she? Which way was they heading? Upcreek, heading north. [WOLF HOWLING] If he harms one hair on her head, I'll hang a Cheyenne scalp in my cabin for every year she's lived. [HOOTING, SHOUTING] [SHOUTING STOPS] [YELLING] Grayeagle! Grayeagle! I have three ponies, fine ponies and strong! [SHOUTS] Grayeagle! Grayeagle! Scar come to trade. [ALL SHOUT] Grayeagle, like the coward the Cheyenne is, has taken the girl and fled. [ALL SHOUTING] [SHOUTING STOPS] Like the coyote, at night he sneaks away. No trade. I will track Grayeagle down before the sun sets this day. I will hang his scalp in the wigwam of the white woman. [ALL SHOUTING] Where the hell have you been, Standing Bear? Been close to them now for two days. -Well, why in the hell haven't you... -Explain later. Just over that rise, there's a camp of Shoshones. Beth was taken in at sunset yesterday. Yeah, I know about the Shoshone camp. -How many of them are there? -About 10. One rode out early this morning alone. May have been Cheyenne who took Beth. Are you sure he was alone? Beth was not with him. Stay close. We're going in... No, wait. We go in after dark. Too many. Now you listen to me. I've come this far and I ain't taking no chances on losing her now. Now how far over that rise are they? About a length of a good horse-run. Come on, Standing Bear. We're going in after her. [ALL SHOUTING] [FIRING GUN] Hold it. Don't make me blow a hole in you. Standing Bear, check the rest of them lodges. Get down here or I'll blow you in two, you... Beth! Beth! Did you find her? She is gone. -Well? -Nothing. Where is she? He knows what I'm saying. Now one last... [SPEAKING SHOSHONE] What the hell's he saying? Beth was taken out at sunup. Ask him if he knows the Cheyenne that got her. [SPEAKING SHOSHONE] He's called Grayeagle. Ask him if he knows where he's taking her. [SPEAKING SHOSHONE] He says he doesn't know. He's lying. You tell him I'll tear him in two with this pistol. I believe he speak truth. Found lodge where Beth and he stayed. Rocks cold. They've been gone for many hours. Ask him if she's been harmed. [SPEAKING SHOSHONE] She was taken care of. At least that's something. Let's ride. Do not fear. How much further do we have to go? Two days we reach camp of Running Wolf. Running Wolf? I don't... I don't understand. When time comes you will know, for you are in the dream of Running Wolf. Dream? It is not for me to say more. When light comes, we ride. Now sleep. Sleep. [SCREAMS] [LAUGHING] Scar. He challenges me to fight for you. [YELLING] [YELLING] [LAUGHS] [LAUGHING] [SPLASHING] You have shown great strength. Strength? I have very little strength left. I can't go on. In two days, it will be done. We go, now. I wish I had your troubles. I guess you know if them Shoshone hadn't given you to me, you'd have probably got starved by 'em, or eaten. [LAUGHING LOUDLY] I figured that'd get your attention. Well, come on now, before that sun bakes you. [BARKING] Damn! Damn! Where's my damn gun? Shit! Go on, attack! Damn it, dog, they're charging us head on. Go on, run! Hide, you coward! Run! Take cover, you damn dog, take cover. -[DOG WHINES] -That's it, run. Run, you coward! Run and hide! Damn it, Willis, hold your fire! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Damn it, Willis, I'm gonna kill ya! Damn! Wrong size. Willis, stop. It's Standing Bear and John Colter. Well, Indian, what we got here is a simple case of mistaken identity. I told you once, I told you twice. You're supposed to be watching, you ain't supposed to be sleeping. You pretty near killed us with that damn cannon. Next time you want to approach my place, you send that damn Indian in with a white rag. Willis, I got some bad news. A Cheyenne came in the back door of my cabin and took my daughter, Beth. I've been tracking him. He come through a Shoshone camp yesterday. They'd stayed there the night before. They called him... Grayeagle. I just wonder if you've seen him or heard of him. Yeah, I heard of him all right. Most of the trappers in these parts heard of him. He's the Cheyenne high warrior. Well, where do you figure he might be taking her? Well, if it really is Grayeagle that's got her, there's only one place he'd be headed. Well, let's have it. This here tobacco pouch was given to me more than four years ago by an old Cheyenne chief. I hear he's camped out now at the head waters of the Missouri. They call him Running Wolf. Now, if my figuring's right, that's where he'd be taking your girl. Standing Bear, have you heard of Running Wolf? Don't know any Cheyenne called Running Wolf. JOHN: Could you take us to their camp? WILLIS: No, sir. They leave me alone, I don't figure to go bothering them. [SPEAKS CHEYENNE] [REPEATS] [REPEATS] [SPEAKING CHEYENNE] Who is he, Standing Bear? The one in the bonnet is called Running Wolf. Well, Standing Bear, I figure in a couple of days we'll be meeting us a Cheyenne chief called Running Wolf. Whoa. Standing Bear, I don't think you ever have lied to me, and I don't want you to start now. So I'm asking you one more time, have you ever heard of Running Wolf? Running Wolf? No. Now, you two, you don't just go marching in on the Cheyenne. Well, I ain't going, and that's final. Well, I reckon only you can make that decision. It's been four years since I've seen Running Wolf. Besides, I don't figure he's my friendliest neighbor. You're gonna get yourselves killed. Last I heard, the whole Cheyenne nation was up there! Go on, dog, tell 'em how you lost your leg. -[DOG BARKING] -Damn fools. Never understand why some folks do what they do. Colter, it's Trapper Willis! Well, come on. I can change my mind if I want to. [LAUGHING, HOOTING] Yahoo! [MEN HOOTING] [BLOWING BUGLE] Here's Scar. The Cheyenne didn't do this. The work of the whites. Kill! -[MEN HOOTING] -Kill! Willis? Willis? [PLAYING BUGLE] [GUN FIRES] Willis! Dog, we're your friends. We ain't gonna hurt ya. [ALL YELLING] If I don't clean this cut, then it'll get infected. Do you understand? Infected. Now we ride. When light comes, you will see Running Wolf. Then will I be free to go home? Only Running Wolf can say. My wound will heal. You must think of yourself. I can't do anything to help myself. Only you can help me. Please, I'm asking you one more time, don't take me into the encampment in the morning. Take me home, please. The dream of Running Wolf is not a dream of death. Do not fear. For I too have had a dream. Soon you will go home. I guess when you get done licking on that plate, you're gonna eat it, too? Since this may be my last meal, if you don't mind, I'll eat it any damn way I please. Figure Running Wolf will deal with you? If he don't, I'm gonna be in a hell of a lot of trouble when I ride in there. Me and Standing Bear will flank for you on either side. You and Standing Bear ain't going in with me. I'm going in alone first to see what the hell's going on. How long will it be till we reach Running Wolf's camp? Well, I figure we should be in about sundown if we get an early start. Standing Bear, I didn't know you were back. The sky is darkening. It tell us that fall is coming and Colter will return soon from his hunt. I will be glad when my husband comes home. It's been very lonely without him. [SHOUTING] [LAUGHING] I brought you your dog. He tried to bite me. [LAUGHING] You know what's happening, don't ya? I sure as hell do. I figure they got Standing Bear along about daylight. You ain't wrong. We're gonna play coup. [YELLING] Get him! [YELLING] By God, Otis, get him! You've only got two to go. Get him, Otis! Get one and you're a free man. Miss him and I've got to bury you. Now the rope. Trip him. Now get him. Now get him. Come on, come at me. [YELLING] Ask 'em if I can have my dog. Give him his dog. [ALL YELLING] You done won your freedom. It ain't my law. It's the law of the Shoshone. Now you head back. Your day is coming. You'll blow that bugle for them to open the gates of hell for you. He never had much, Lord, exceptin' his old dog. And somehow that just don't seem right. Willis! Willis! Willis! BUGLER: Willis! Willis! You have done well, Grayeagle. You have brought me the face I have seen painted in the afternoon sky. [SPEAKS CHEYENNE] [CHANTING, RATTLING] Your hair is as smooth as a young deer rolling in the sun. I shall soon be with the Great Spirit. Grayeagle will return you to your home. It is the way of the Cheyenne that when a child is born to a chief, that his eyes must look upon that child before his death, or his spirit will wander in the skies forever. For this that you have done, I will reward you with many gifts. Now go, my daughter. The time is near for me to stand and account for my deeds before the Great Spirit. I don't understand. We must go. Soon you will understand. Can we leave today? We will leave soon. Can I have my clothes back? You came here as Cheyenne. You will leave as Cheyenne. Are you telling me that that old dying chief in there is my father? He was a great chief. His heart reasoned with all. His people love him. If you had known him, you would be proud. Yes. I tell you he is your father. Oh, thank God. It's Standing Bear. Standing Bear! Standing Bear! Standing Bear! Beth! Beth! [GIGGLING] BUGLER: I got something fine, bears. Come get your dinner. I got you this. [STRAINING] Come get your dinner, bears. Where are you, bears? Bugler! Blow that bugle so they can open the gates of hell for you, 'cause you're coming in. You wouldn't shoot ol' Bugler, would you? Would you? A man like...like you wouldn't shoot ol' Bugler in the back. No sooner than I would a rattler. [COCKS GUN] -[TRAP SNAPPING] -[SCREAMING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] Oh, Standing Bear, you frightened me. When the sun rises and clears the mountains, the Cheyenne will honor your coming home. Do you think Father and Trapper Willis will get here in the morning? Oh, Standing Bear, how will you tell him? I will say what has been hidden deep within me for many years. I could not say it till now. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [CHEYENNE CHANTING] [ALL CONTINUE CHANTING] [CHEYENNE HOOTING, SHOUTING] [RATTLING] [MEN SINGING] ♪ He did it! [CHEERING] [CHANTING] It is a good day to die, for now he has seen you and his spirit joins the Great Spirit forever. [GROANS] Where am I? You're over at my place. That's the first sound I heard out of you in more than a day. Yesterday, I was measuring you for the ground. Ow. How'd I get here? We went out and got you. You'd have been a goner for sure if my old mare hadn't have found her way to the house. The last thing I recollect before riding out was putting a bullet in that damn Bugler. Yeah, we found him too, tangled up good in one of his own traps. That's good. Hold on. Lay down now. You just take it easy right there. Well, I can't just lay here knowing Beth's still out there. Yeah, you can't help that girl a bit if you's dead. The way that thing looks, you ain't gonna get 10 feet 'fore you keel over. Besides that, it's getting late. Well, I'd best be getting back to my place and pick up some fresh horses and some extra supplies. I've got to find her and get her home before fall. You'd better go over to Fort Harris and get you some help. No, it's too late for that. If a soldier got within 20 miles of that camp, they'd kill her. Yeah. If they haven't already. Standing Bear, do you think Father went back with Trapper Willis to his cabin? If we don't see them at the next pass, we will head for Trapper Willis's. I've had the strangest feeling that we are being followed. Grayeagle followed all first day. But I haven't seen him all morning. Let's get out of here. [MEN HOOTING, SHOUTING] It's Grayeagle. He's giving us our chance. Let's ride. [GUN FIRING] We've got to do something, or he hasn't got a chance! He did it that you might live. We must go. Come on! [MEN HOOTING] [GUN FIRING] BETH: Pa! Colter! Colter! We're back. I'm home. I'm home. I'm home. You're the only father I've ever had, and I'm thankful that I'm home. This country can be mighty hard on a man. It can give him a lot of things, but it can take 'em away... Just the way it took your mother when you was born. And I know you understand that it can especially be hard on a woman. I'm just thankful that I had her for a short while. Standing Bear also told me that Grayeagle gave his life so you could be brought home. [SOBBING] Come. He's on the hill.
