“What the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes” - Harry Houdini Magic is the art of making the impossible possible. It is a bridge between the visible and the invisible. It is the force that tries to deceive the spectator with incredible situations and defy all logic. Magic is the science that aspires to reveal and know the hidden to the senses... The hidden to logic... The hidden to reason... Magic is chaos. It is a curse, a blessing and progress. Everything depends on who uses it. Magic is everywhere... Around us... Never forget it. 30 years later You cannot enter sir. Why can't I come in? I'm Lorenzo Mancini. Don't you see? I have a show to do! How come I cannot...? - Lorenzo! Let him through Thanks fabrizio... what happened? Come, follow me. You will not believe your eyes Lorenzo. You have to see this for yourself. Does it have to do with my show? Stay calm. I'm not going to cancel it. I have sold almost all the tickets... Wait for me here. Lorenzo... Agent carusso wants to ask you some questions. Mr. Mancini? Yes? I would like to know if you knew the victim? No, it's the first time I've seen her. Do you have any enemies? Have you received any threats or noticed anything unusual lately? It seems strange that the night before your debut a woman appears murdered on stage. And where were you last night? I was with antonella... My assistant. I'm going to need to speak with her. Sir, we need you to see something. Excuse me. "Once again the local theater was the victim of horror..." "The murderer caused the victim's death using the famous magic trick known as "the box and the swords"" what can I get you sir? A whiskey on the rocks. "Causing a slow and painful death. The police continuetheir investigation to determine the identity of the victim..." "The murder occurred in the theater before the premiere show of magician Lorenzo Mancini..." "Son of the prestigious magician "Dante the great", who died in an accident during one of his tricks..." Here you go sir. - Thank you. "In the very same theater 30 years ago. The death occurred during the trick known as "the bullet catch"..." "Which has already caused the death of six magicians around the world and apparently, continues to add victims." "In other news, the prestigious local record company "black widow records" will release a highly..." Where were you? I was checking that everything is in order. You shouldn't be drinking. Tonight is your big night. Calm down... Are you ready? There are millenary cultures that consider that every body inhabits a dweller... A dweller that can bear the form of a demon... or a genius... They give the ability to very few to predict. To guess the behavior of other people... Their knowledge... Their emotions... Their intentions. In order to carry out this experience I ask you to concentrate... Very good. What you are seeing is a collection of diamonds and circles of different colors. Observe. Choose a circle. I ask you to focus on the figure you have chosen and move to the left or right to the nearest diamond. Good. Move up or down to the nearest circle. Now move diagonally to the nearest diamond. And finally, move left or right to the nearest circle. Good. At this point I have no way of knowing at which figure you have arrived. Or maybe I do. Japan, the land of origami. The art of creating figures with paper. But Japan is also the land of the samurai and of the geishas. An old wise man once told me: "May the three never meet" I don't understand what went wrong! Damn it. We rehearsed a hundred times and it always went well! God... I don't understand. No, it wasn't your fault. It was me. I took too long to appear. Be calm. Do I know you from somewhere? Who, me? Yes. I'm almost certain... Are you from here? Yes. I know you. I bet a thousand. One thousand? You are nervous... You wouldn't be bluffing, would you? I see your thousand, and I raise you ten thousand. I call. Full house of kings and six. Full house of aces... He dealt from the bottom. I don't want to see you around here ever again! Do you understand me?! Lorenzo... what happened to you? Have you been playing again? I fell off the bike. Forgive me. I don't know where to go. Just because I'm helping you, doesn't mean that I have forgiven you. You can sleep on the sofa if you want. Hello? Hello??? Antonella! Antonella! What can I get you? A whiskey on the rocks. Thank you. I'm looking for a girl... Antonella. Do you know her? Antonella? No, sorry. Gennaro bernardi. What a tragedy... I don't understand how they haven't caught him yet. It's obvious that it was the magician who came to the city. Who else could it be? Poor girl. She used to come to the library. How can I help you? I'm looking for the newspaper archive. Head down that corridor and you will find it. Thank you. Yes? I am looking for gennaro bernardi. On whose behalf? Lorenzo Mancini. Wait a moment please. Go ahead. Up the stairs. At the end of the hall. Thank you. Lorenzo Mancini. Finally we meet again. Gennaro bernardi, the murderer of my father. Twenty years behind bars I spent unfairly. I didn't kill your father. It wasn't me who changed the bullet. Believe me. And why should I believe you? Dante and I were more than just friends... We were brothers. What does that pendant mean? What? You don't know what it means? So it's true that they brainwashed you in there. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. From what I see, you have been following me. Why are you implicating me in the crimes? Fabrizio... bernardi. Yes. I went to see your father gennaro. Was it you? Wait fabrizio, put the gun down! Wasn't it enough that you had my father imprisoned for twenty years? You also had to kill him? Wait, fabrizio! When I left he was alive. Take it easy. Put the gun down. I should have left you locked up forever. "Nothing is what it seems" Antonella! Antonella, open up! Lorenzo... what happened? It can't be, it can't be. What can't be? Someone is killing all of them and wants to pin the blame on me. On me! Who, Lorenzo? I don't know... a strange guy. He looks like a policeman. All this is related to the death of my father. Calm down. Everything is going to be fine. Calm down. Believe me. Everything is going to be fine. Are you looking for this? The perfect crime is not one that remains unsolved, but one that is solved with a false perpetrator. Haven't you realized yet? The truth was in front of your eyes the whole time. Look in the mirror. After ruling out the impossible... All that remains is the truth.
