Do whatever you do together Do you imagine other private parts ... - Neutered and butts ... - It's my husband Not my soulmate And I'm not comfortable talking to you about my sexuality why not? I just told you what I'm thinking I am sure you can imagine fondling various members If I were not straight I guess I might have been dreaming Establish a relationship with the postman Instead of wondering if he's in a relationship with my wife In any case... Don't open the door yet, Willis. Wait for the taxi to arrive The weather is cold Your mom will take you to school this week I will see you soon Maybe this weekend Ok, dad Willis ... Perhaps the following week - You know you are my favorite girl, don't you? - Yes, father We must go Well, be careful, the ground is slippery Are you all right, Sarah? I know what you are planning I planned this whole thing with your sister You want to take advantage of me because you both think I've lost my mind But I didn't lose my mind The bank is now closed But I'll sort out this mess in the morning It would be impossible To allow you both to hide the truth about your mother from me Who do you think paid for this house ...

Your mom liked this nonsense It is the imagination of the artist She went with her friends twice a week To an art lesson It is run by an important anonymous man In (Utica) - She didn't let her do that for a long time - a 100-mile round trip She was good at drawing She did not need a misfit person to teach her how to paint You know the farmhouse painting by your bed - Your grandmother Gwen drew? - Did you change the date of the real estate broker? - You told me to cancel it - that was not the question, you smart one Well, I canceled the appointment this morning. We can make a new one if you like - We have to - I just got here I mean, let me know what I must do for the love of God Sleeping was beautiful for a change And now we're doing something ... fun وعلوماتي Or educational Instead of running aground without adrift Isn't it, Monica? Are you enjoying my little one? I think so This guy (Picasso) ... Nice Perhaps he was a Spanish communist and painted like a backward But I am sure that he was good at choosing whoever he wanted from the foreign women Women love these art trivia Who feels hungry?

Yeah, it was a little sad my grandmother was ... I became very sick at that time We had a quiet Christmas You skated the whole time we were there on their pool I forgot my skis at home And my dad came in to Bonneville. - He bought me a new husband. - He stopped talking about that place Gosh! Two Giant Sleds - Boys' Hockey Skates - They were too big - it was the only size available I had to wear 3 pairs of socks so my feet wouldn't wobble in them And she didn't let me measure them, dad - I went and bought them - they should have been a surprise I do not know I'm just teasing you. It was a wonderful gift - Thank you - it cost me as much money as I can remember But you were happy I was obsessed with that guy ...

He said... Go and treat yourself to a broken beer Do you still have Brie? How many horses are there now? - There are five, right? - three Bree's still strong Her friend (Starlight) gave up. We had to kill her in the spring too bad I love (Starlight) - a silly name, a name for a stripper dancer She was a good mare But it's as good as (brie) (Brie) was always very fat Fatter than lamb in the spring And lean to the right like a drunk sailor But your mom insisted on buying that mare You mean (Jill) She was an accomplished knight, I'll admit it to her She could ride a burning snake I didn’t know why that sick old mare wanted Why ... why didn't you take (Jill) (Brie) with her when you two broke up? I purchased the Persians it's mine She eats two and gnaws at wood like a beaver It did not matter what to paint the fence or the stable door She was devouring wood as if it were sugar She was always very emotional She was chasing Jill like a puppy And I think she was a little lazy when it came to riding her Spoiled by your mother pampered She gave her enough apples to open an apple press - (Jill) - Prostitute (Paula) ... Do you want to know what they are showing in the cinema? Come on, I have the Sandy Paper to look at I have my phone here I can check for you Maybe inside? I am not afraid of my grandfather advantage Not Gwen, but another prostitute She thought I didn't see what to do I heard her talking in the hallway She was raising the radio very loudly So I knew she was on the phone with him Like a teen prostitute She hated me You all also hate me And she rubs her body like an intent to feel excited She rubbed her body with anything that moved And you always go to the store to buy something And it sneaks in secret I smelled it on her Everyone knew about it Oh my God! His hand is really green The garden looks amazing This backyard was a barren patch It was full ... with weeds and sand Now look at him I wish he would come and fix our yard And he puts a flower garden or the like Tom sends his peace to you, by the way And he apologizes because he was not able to attend today, because ... He helps his brother paint his house The weather was very humid And it was so hot even in the middle of the night It's the only time I can remember having sweat And I look at the full moon Except for that time we had an affair near Peak Lake. Do you remember? I've never heard duck sounds that often in my life Her voices were causing deafness His condition worsens at the end of the day What? Nothing, dad Women are like fish They just keep swimming I caught her red flag That was all at once ... So she left I was waiting to catch that prostitute while she was cheating on me - To kick her out ... - If she really moved here I am sure you can sell the farm Land prices went up a little again, right? Weather ... the weather is much drier and hot in the summer But the horses will get used to it and maybe ... And maybe Tom and I can transport the horses across the country Or (John) maybe Who feeds her now? - Danny? - Another damned exploiter Always loved it Danny Ward was the only anomaly in the entire county And she chooses it The only non-normal, except for your brother, of course And now your son looks like he is a misfit too It seems that your mother was a willing woman to give birth to the wrong Was about 4 inches removed from his colon 5 years ago? - About 6 years ago, in fact - it helped me a lot I can no longer even get half ready in my body When was the last time a doctor examined you? - He examined me?

It will be a little annoying but it won't take long Just use a finger please I'm old for real excitement Breathe gently and relax - that's easy for you to say - Did you find what you like? Not yet Maybe you should check out my son He's probably feeling very excited There is slight swelling - it's not personal, doctor You can sit down and get dressed now How long will your father visit you?

I think so, Mr Petersen. Now try not to change your posture too violently Because I don't want to have to sew the stitches again I hate this damn place The sooner we make your digestive system work, the faster you will be home You're a warrior, Mr Petersen. - I'm a Viking. - Of course I'm a Viking. - Yes, okay ... You should slow down a little So that we, the mortals, can keep up with you Come close, moment close Your nurses ...

A real hue girl? See you in the morning Taste a little broccoli, daddy, that will cleanse your body It helps improve digestion I don't like broccoli And the chicken tastes like cardboard Take a sip of water Water is where the fish relieve themselves Mr Dunson Mr Dunson You should get used to eating less fat and more processed foods I prefer to eat what I love and die happy Instead of living as a bisexual slave What do you think of more olive oil? I'm afraid I can't let you eat more salt but ... There is nothing wrong with oil Or ... or ... what do you think of a pinch of pepper?
