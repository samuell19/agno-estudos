It's very dark in here. What happened? It's very dark in here. Then, switch on the light. -Where's the switch? -I don't know. I am very scared. It's here. Wow! This place is so cool. Isn't it? Okay, tell me. Would you find a better romantic place than this in Goa? No one would come to know either. By the way, Rohan.. Whom does this bungalow belong to? NATH VILLA It's really so interesting. Both of us are alone in this bungalow, with a ghost to accompany us! Have you brought something to eat? Of course, I have. Do you know what I have arranged? Candle light dinner along with champagne!

Hold it. Hold it. Rohan, I saw someone over there! Tina, enough. You are going overboard. I saw someone over there. Please, let's leave. It is your illusion. Why do you have to scream? It's just power cut. The television is switched on. Tina, there's no electricity. How then will the TV get switched on? -Rohan, I'm telling you. Listen to me. -Enough. Tina, stop it. You're ruining the evening. Stop it. Wait here. Please, believe me. I am not lying. -Let's see now. -I did see someone. Please.

Chinch! Chinchpokli! The TC rang the bell and the bus stands. You sing well. Why did the other taxi drivers refuse to go to Nath Villa? Sir, I'll tell you something. Are you related to Mr Nath? No, we've rented that bungalow. It is better to rent another bungalow. Why do you have to invite trouble? Why? What's wrong with that bungalow? Madam, it is said that the bungalow is haunted. -There is a ghost in there. -Ghost? Ghosts do not exist. Nonsense. My taxi stopped at the very mention of ghost. -What happened? -Just a moment. Sir,I do not think that the taxi would move further. Then, Will we have to walk? -Yes, you'll have to walk from here. -It's close by. -Come on Banku, let's carry mom till there. -Oh, no!

I got it cleaned recently. I got it cleaned thoroughly as and when I got to know about your arrival. Is this called clean? It is clean. I am sure that you will do the rest of the cleaning. I think, we will have to break the glass. Banku, what are you doing? This man asked me to do so. No problem.We shall fix another one. -Then, I will break it completely. -Good idea. -I was just... -How I will handle all these by myself? Hey,open the door through the broken glass. Come on, I will get it. -Get the luggage. -Such a big house! Oh, my God! Such a big house! Great! Earlier, people used to build homes with such indulgence. Your company is unique. -Couldn't they give us a medium sized house? -Anjali... Madam, there's a terrace as well. -What? -Wow! There's a terrace too! No, Banku. Be careful at the stairs. -Go ahead. Good. -You might fall down. Madam,you will get 24 hours water supply here. You can do your household chores at your convenience. Madam needs just one hour for all of that. Anjali is quick at her work. -Come with me. I'll show you the kitchen. -Aditya, you are too much. Go, see the kitchen. Go on. -This one, right? -Yes. Here, take it. I wanted to ask you something. I heard a lot of rumors about this house. The cab driver too mentioned to us that this place is haunted. Sir, all these are just rubbish. Actually, the owner of this house stays in America. I have been given the responsibility of this house. So, they are jealous. They spread rumors out of envy. Trust me. None of them are true. Sign here. Mom... -Banku... -Mom... -What happened? Banku.. -Calm down, Anjali. -Mom... -Banku. Banku, what happened? The terrace is quite big. It will be so much fun to play cricket here. Why do you have to scream for that? You scared your mom. -I wasn't scared. -But, I got scared. -Your son is very naughty. -He is too much. -Let's go down, dear. -Come on, bowl to me. -Come on. -Let's go down now. Mr Jagan,kids are bound to be mischievous. How many kids do you have? I have two daughters. They are very sober. -I work hard all day for their well being. -Banku, careful. Yes, one has to stay away from their house for work. Look at me. I stay away from my family for months together. What do you mean by months together? I am the chief engineer of a cruise liner. -I too have to go along with the cruise. -Okay. He leaves us alone everytime. That is the reason I wanted a house where... ...both of them are safe. You will be safe here. You need not have to worry about anything at all. Here, please sign here. Oh! I forgot about it completely. What? What do you expect me to make? Nothing. Sandwich is our favorite. So, sandwich for breakfast, lunch and dinner too. Sandwich, Witch. Adi... -Dad! -Yes. Will mom give me sandwiches as tiffin, here too? No. She'll cook Maggi noodles at times. -I can hear everything. -Good then. When is your cruise leaving? It will leave after two days. Not at all. You cannot go anywhere until everything gets settled here. Yes, dad. My dear son, I'll have to go. I can't have these sandwiches anymore. Very funny. Anjali, don't feel bad. Don't continue to sleep in the morning. Wake up with the alarm. Otherwise, Banku will miss his school. I will take care of that. But,you must advice the little brat... ...to behave properly. Come on. Anjali, be realistic. We can ask him to do only those things that is within his ability. I shall advice him. Banku,try new pranks in the new school. Don't get on with your old mischief. Don't trouble your mom at any cost. Otherwise,you very well know that I will be angry. I've scared him. Now on, he will be in control. Adi, what's going on? You're a father now. Why don't you behave like one? What's wrong with you? Our son understands English. Don't scold me in front of him. He won't respect us when he grows up. Banku, close your eyes.

He was trying to steal things from the kitchen. I just chased him away. So, was he possessed? Ghosts don't exist. There are just angels. Angels! What is an angel? Angels! When God is happy with someone... ...he makes him an angel. God made your grandfather an angel. When your grandfather met God, God realized that.. ...he was none other than Banku's grandfather! So, he turned him into a star.. ...so that he could watch you forever. Mom, have you seen an angel? Yes, I have. His name is Banku. -What if I find an angel someday? -Yes! What will I do? Just befriend him and tell him your stories. What will he look like? If your grandfather sends him, he will definitely look like grandfather. -Then, I can recognize him. -Yes. It's Dad's call. Banku, go slow. Be careful at the stairs. -Dad. -Great! Naughty boy. How did you know that it's your Dad's call? What were you doing? Today, I spilt ink on the principal at school. Very good. Did you restart playing pranks? -That had to happen. -They called me to school on my first day. Advice him. Otherwise, he will be rusticated. How is your work going on? Anjali, workload is high. It might take sometime to come there. -Did you set everything in the house? -No. The luggage has arrived from the cargo. But, I am not able to find a maid. Everyone is scared of the ghost stories.

Didn't I ask you not to take it? -I just took a little. I had spilt it on the ground. Where is the bowl? Mom, the bowl and spoon were right here. You first ate an ice cream without my permission. Then, you told me that you saw someone. It's true. I saw someone here. You started spinning a tale just because I told you about the angel? You will cry if I hit you now. Just go upstairs. Don't touch the fridge without my permission. How will you wake up in the morning and go to school? Neither will I be able to get up. You've become very mischievous. You should be sent to the boarding school. Let's go upstairs. You pretend to have seen someone just for the sake of an ice cream. What are you looking for? Come on. I opened the fridge... ...and took out the ice cream. The bowl fell from my hand. Where then did it vanish? Look at that. I had told mom that the bowl had fallen here. But, she did not believe me. You had hidden the bowl. Hadn't you? Have you come to steal ice cream? Okay. Are you Anthony who got beaten up by my mom? -I am a ghost. -Ghost! Ghosts don't exist. Mom said that angels exist. Okay. So, are you the angel? I told you that I am a ghost. Didn't I tell you that ghosts don't exist? -So, have you come to stay here? -No. This is my house. I have come here to chase you out from here. -This is our house. -This is my house. -This is our house. -I told you that this is my house. Lower your voice.

Didn't you see my name outside at the gate? Nath. Sometimes you say you're a ghost, sometimes you say you are Nath. Is your name Bhootnath? I am a ghost, and not Bhootnath. This is my house. Come on, get out of here. I told you that this is our house. But, you can stay here. I'll convince mom. You won't budge that easily. I must do something. What will you do? Wait! I'll show you. Why are you laughing? -You're making funny faces. -Funny faces! Yes. Take part in a fancy dress competition... ...and you are sure to win the first prize. He is strange. The whole world is scared of me and he laughs at me. I am trying to scare you. Don't you get scared? -Do you get scared? -Why should I get scared? Everyone says a ghost resides here. -Have you seen him? -Why would I see him? But, don't get scared. I stay in this room with mom. You can call me if you get scared. Aren't we friends now? Friends! -One more thing. -What? -Come closer. -What? I want to go to the bathroom. -Bathroom? -Bathroom. -Then, go ahead. -Come with me. You carry on. Why would I come with you?

Really! Then, he must've eaten this ice cream too. No, he did not eat. I even offered him. He will stay here, with us, now on. He is my friend now. Good. I will tell the angel to brush your teeth everyday... ...help you with your homework and take you to school. He must play with me as well. Do you know what he told me? Tell me that later. You're getting late for school. Mom, it's not a story. The angel really exists. Yes, I am not denying it. Okay, listen to me. I shouldn't get any complaints from your school today. Is that okay? -Bye, mom. -Bye. Bye, angel. You and your angel. I saw a tall man, wearing... ...a black coat in front of me. I got up and went to him. I asked him, "Yes?" Who are you? What are you doing in my house? He turned towards me. He had long hands. His teeth were black. His eyes were red. Was he an angel or a ghost? Cleaning. Such a big house to clean! Why have you come here again? Do you want to get beaten up again? This was my house. I neither have a place to stay.. ..nor any work to do. -Will you clean the house? -I'll clean everything. Don't steal anything or I'll get you arrested by the police. I shall pay you Rupees 20 if you work diligently. Give me Rupees 25. I'll then be able to buy a bottle of liquor as well. -Please! -Come on, pick up the broom. -Come on, hurry up. -Thank you. You can start from here. Darn! You're so dirty. Go and have a bath first. Yes. Come on, give me Rupees 25. Go away. Look at him. -What are you looking at? -Can't you see? I am seeing everything. You haven't cleaned anything. There's so much work pending inside.

Be careful. -Look at him. -Who else is hitting me? Who else is hitting me? Come on, move it. No, it's not my fault. It's not my fault. Please hold it. -I will not spare you. -She didn't even pay me. I don't want to stay in this house. Aditya, I don't want to stay here. Ask your company to arrange for some other place right now. Anjali, do you want to leave such a nice house... ...only because you didn't find a servant? What would bother you after all? You left the place as soon as we shifted our house. It's me who has to handle everything. Wake up early in the morning. I must ready Banku... ...and then myself. I must prepare his tiffin. Tiffin! He doesn't even finish his tiff in. Do you have a problem with the house or with the tiffin? -What? -Do you find it funny? Okay, laugh. I am not laughing at you. I'll talk to mom. She'll come and stay with you for a few days to help you. You need not call mom. She anyway thinks that I am lazy. You just look for another house. We won't stay here. Okay.

Didn't you? No. I was playing and fell down. We often get hurt when we play. Don't we? Your bruise is similar to mine. You wouldn't have fallen if I had held your hand. Am I right? Even my grandpa couldn't hold my hand. You too are like my grandpa. You called me grandpa. You consider me to be an angel. And I let you... I don't know if I am an angel or not. But you are an angel for sure. My angel. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. Hello. -Hello. -Jagan, Its Vijay Nath. Mr Vijay, you'll live a long life. I was just remembering you.

When the lion sees its prey... ...and wags its tail in happiness. It is wagging its tail. I know that. Then, the lion slowly moves towards its prey. Sir, It's moving indeed. After that he jumps. -Sir, it's gone. -Yes, it's gone. Sir, it's really gone. -Where did it go? -To hunt. -Banku! -What is this? The same tiffin everyday? Don't you feel ashamed?

No, you must do some magic so that I can defeat Jojo. No. You must not cheat in sports. You just run faster. Come on. Didn't you see the number of hurdles there? I won't run. Banku, have you ever seen an ant? -Ant? -Yes, ant. What does an ant do, if a hurdle is kept in front of it? -She goes around it. -Absolutely right. What if you keep another hurdle in front of it? -She again goes around it. -That's it. If a little ant never gives up, why should big Banku... ...give up? You will win this hurdle race with your hard work. There is no magic in life. It's only hard work. It's only hard work. Okay. Now go and win this hurdle race. Come on. Jojo. Jojo. The hurdle race winner is Banku. Yes. This is really deep. Yes, that's right. It's really deep. This is the only way to know if angel is with him. He thinks of himself as a champion just because he got a bicycle. -Come on, hurry up. -Yes. -Cover it up. -Come on. Banku shouldn't be able to see the well. Jojo... He has fallen in the well. Rahul... Sonu... help me. How can you run away leaving me like that? Rahul... Sonu... -Jojo? -Get me out of this well. Where are you going leaving me like that? But, Jojo, where are you? Banku, I am in the well. -What are you doing here? -I fell into it. How will you come out now? Okay, fine. I will call your mom. -No, my mom will beat me up. -How then will you get out? -Ask your angel to help me. -But, he will be at home. Jojo, you're too much. You should have been careful. Banku, shall I tell you something. Please don't get angry with me. Actually, I planned to make you fall in here... ...so that we get know if any angel is with you in reality. Okay, then just lie where you are. -Banku, listen to me, please. -Bhootnath. Banku, what happened? -Did your friend fall in the well? -He is not my friend. He wanted me to fall in it but instead, he fell into it. Its good. No Banku, don't say that. He is your friend. Banku, sorry. Please, get me out from here. Your friend is apologizing to you. Forgive him. Banku, learn to forgive. Doesn't your mom forgive you when you pull a prank? Doesn't she? You forgive him the same way. What did you do when you befriended Jojo for the first time? I gave him a handshake. I extended my hand for friendship. You did that. Now, go and extend your hand for him. -Come here. -What's the matter? Look at it, Bhootnath. Look at how deep the well is. How will my hand reach there? It will reach for sure. Just put it forth. -It won't reach him. -Do it. It will reach him. Banku, why are you showing me your hand? Go and get a rope. How will your hand reach here? Give me your hand. Banku, what are you doing? -Take it back. -Don't be afraid. Give me your hand. Don't be afraid, come on. How did you do that? Do you now believe that I have an angel? But don't tell anyone about it. -Good. -Sir, its confirmed news. Banku really has got an angel. -But don't tell anyone. -Yes. What? I have seen lot of mischievous boys but not a story teller like him. Do you know what the entire school learns these days? Banku and angel's stories. Mrs Sharma, you can spoil your kid at your will. But the other kids are my responsibility too. -Yes, sir. -This is final warning. Otherwise you can enroll your son in some other school. Why do you have to tell those fake stories? I told them the truth. What kind of truth? Have you seen an angel? Okay. If you have seen angel then you must have seen a ghost too. No, ghost doesn't exist. Didn't you tell me that? -Even angels don't exist. -They do exist. -Whom are you trying to signal? -Angel! What is it? Where is angel? Right here. Angel, come here. -Banku, what are you trying to get at? -Please, come right here. Please angel, come to me. Mom won't listen to me. Banku, listen to me. I am requesting angel to appear before me. Banku, stop that nonsense at once. Go to your room. Enough of your jokes. Does one need to hit a child like this? Banku. Just let it go Leave it Just let it go Leave it Do not get annoyed Tell something Listen to me too Why be silent and suffer from within? Just let it go Leave it Just let it go Leave it Whom do I speak to if you get upset with me? I feel I am alive after meeting you I exist because of you Whom should I speak to if you are upset with me? I feel I am alive after meeting you I exist because of you You are upset with me at the moment, yet, you are mine It's too bad to be so very exasperated Just let it go Leave it Just let it go Leave it The apple of my eye My little prince Don't be so upset with me Don't punish me so severely The apple of my eye My little prince Don't be so upset with me Don't punish me so severely My arms are yearning to hold you Come on, let me love you Enough of fights now Just let it go Leave it Do not get annoyed Tell something Listen to me too Why be so silent and suffer from within? Just let it go Leave it Just let it go Leave it Bhootnath. Bhootnath. Bhootnath, Do you see the star over there? That's my grandpa. He left me and went away. He didn't leave you and go. He is watching you. Your grandpa misses and loves you a lot. -Really! -Yes. Bhootnath, when you weren't here with me... ...I used to miss grandpa a lot. When you weren't talking to me... I too was... But, you won't leave me like my grandpa. Would you? No, never. You're everything to me. How can I leave you? Then, come for the fancy dress tomorrow for sure. -There is a surprise for you. -Surprise! What, surprise? Didn't you hide the bowl? Have you come here to steal the ice cream? Okay, you're Anthony, whom my mom had beaten. I am a ghost. Ghosts don't exist. Mom had told me that angels do exist. Okay, so are you an angel? -I am a ghost. -Ghosts don't exist. -This is my house. -Anjali... He has worn clothes like uncle Kailash Nath. Who is uncle Kailash Nath? The place where you stay, belongs to him. His ghost stories are quite famous. I am a ghost. Do you know that an angel stays at our house with us? Mom, there is not even a single photo of angel. I am requesting angel to appear before you. Kailash Nath. Kailash Nath is my dad's name. -Nath Villa is named after him. -I see. -Is that you, Mr Vijay? -How are you, Jagan? I am fine with God's grace. You were supposed to come tomorrow. You could have called me. I would've come to receive you. He is Jagan. He has been taking care of property here. -Greetings. -Jagan, this is Mr Sanjay Malhotra. He owns a lot of big resorts. He wants to see Nath Villa. Not just see. I want to buy it. What does he mean? I wanted to tell you that a family stays there now. -It doesn't matter, show him the bungalow. -What about the family? We'll arrange a house for the family elsewhere, if I like the bungalow. -Vijay, what do you say? -Correct. Who are you? Is there any elder member in this family? Yes. Mr Vijay Nath has sent us. He is Mr Sanjay Malhotra. We want to see the site. We are buying this villa. You can't see this house without permission. Madam, Mr Vijay Nath has given us the permission. -I want to talk to Jagan. -Jagan has dropped us here. But we own this house for a year. My husband's company has allotted it to us. No one can touch my house. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out. This is Kailash Nath's house, and not of Vijay Nath. Get out. Come on, go. Bhootnath. Bhootnath, don't do that. Don't get angry. Please, Bhootnath. You people won't go anywhere. Mom. Angel, don't do that. Mom is getting scared. Angel, don't get angry. You won't go anywhere from here. I will never leave you and go. Banku, whom are you talking to? With angel. He is angry. -What? -Angel, please show your face to us. I am Kailash Nath, whom the world calls a ghost. But your son thinks that I am an angel. This is my house. My wife, Nirmala's house. She decorated it herself. She decorated each and every corner all by herself. She made this house a home. She made it a home. We also had a family. We too had a happy family like yours. My son Vijay, daughter-in-law Ishana... ...and my grandson Vibhut, who was just like your son. Vijay left. He went abroad, leaving this house. Bless you. -Mother, I don't feel like going at all. -Then, don't go. What are you saying? He's taking the first step. You must not stop him like that. Come with me, son. He settled over there... ...and left us alone here. His mother longed to see him. She used to sit here all day long and wait for him. Yes, Dad. Did you get the check on time? Dear, I get the check on time, but not you. I am trying to come. The conference is in Mumbai this time. If I come to Mumbai, I will surely come to Goa. Son, if you happen to come here... ...tell your mother that you've come to meet her. Don't tell her about the conference. Okay, I am taking this phone to mother. Talk to her as well, okay? He must have forgotten. No, sometimes there is a problem in the connection. America is so far. Our son has gone away from us. Earlier, he used to come running to us at a single call. Nirmala passed away, waiting for her son. She left me alone here. Didn't your son return? He did. Dad, I... Dad, I am sorry. Sorry, dad. You are too late, son. I am sorry, Dad! I am sorry! Look at that star. -That one. -Yes. -Is that Grandma? -Yes. Wherever I go, will she be with me? Yes! Wherever you go, grandma will be with you. Grandma, now I won't go anywhere. Grandpa, now I'll be with you over here. I won't let you go anywhere. Hey. Catch him. Catch him. So this is the house, Mr Pradhan. It's huge, and very well constructed. Oh, yes, and you don't have to make a lot of changes. What's upstairs? It's the terrace. Come on, let's see. Come on! We are home. We're... Meet my dad, Mr Kailash Nath. Dad, this is Mr Pradhan. He owns a resort business. He is buying our house. Mr Kailash Nath, you can assume that we've already bought it. In fact, we would complete the paper work tomorrow. Excuse me, Mr Pradhan. This house is not for sale. -But Vijay told me that... -He is still a child. He won't decide about what needs to be done with this house. -Vijay, what is this? -I'm very sorry, Mr Pradhan. You keep the papers ready. We'll talk tomorrow. This house won't be sold. Didn't you hear that? I had, with great difficulty, got such a good deal. But you... Are you trying to sell this house? Dad, what's so special about this house? What's so special about this house? Are you asking me the speciality of this house? You've spent your childhood in this house. When, for the first time, you came into this world onto your mother's lap... ...she was very happy. That happiness lingers in this house. When you started to walk, she smiled... ...and when you used to fall sick... ...your mother used to stay awake all night and look after you. That worry can be felt in this house. She fell sick.. ...and took her last breath... ...waiting for her son to come home. We can sense her longing in this house. Dad, you don't understand. All of us will go back to America. Then, who's going to look after such a big house? -Let's sell it. -Why should we sell it? -All of us will stay here together. -No dad, I can't stay here. I can't come back here every now and then. My work suffers, Vibhut's studies suffer. If he had to stay here, why did you send him abroad at the first place? I sent him to study, not to settle over there. Dad, then come to America with us. There's nothing left here now. Moreover, what will you do here alone? Mother is no more now. Mother hasn't gone anywhere. She's in this house. She's listening to you. You can go back. Go and do your work. I'll stay here... ...and wonder as to where did I go wrong in nurturing you. This is really humiliating. I mean, do you have any right on this house or not? I am sorry, Vijay. But I can't stay here anymore! There's no need to take him to America. He is not coming with us to America. Dad, I won't go. Dad. Dad, I... Never mind, dear. People make mistakes. Every human makes mistakes. No, dad. We are going. Are you going? What do you mean by that? Dad, we are going back to America. No, Vijay. Where are you going? Dad, come to America whenever you want. How will I live without all of you? I'll send the checks every month. -Vijay, listen to me. -Grandpa, I won't go. No, dear. We won't go anywhere. Daughter-in-law, keep the luggage back. Vibhut, come on. Come down. -No! I won't go. -I asked you to come down. -Vijay. -Vibhut, come here, son. No, Vijay. You can't live without your son... ...and I too can't live without my son. Don't go, Vijay. Don't go. -What are you doing, daughter-in-law? -Grandpa, I won't go. Grandpa, I won't go. Vijay. Vijay. Vijay, don't go. Vijay. Vijay. Vijay, don't leave me and go. I was lying right here. He didn't even see me once. Not even once. Since then, I've been wandering in this house. I never allowed anyone to live in this house. Then, he came here. My angel. He changed me. I forgot that I'm not alive. Does it hurt now? No, dear. It doesn't hurt now. How long will you keep wandering like that? Why don't you forgive your son? No. Never. I will never forgive him. He left me. But, I will never leave this house... ...even if I have to wander here for the next 100 lives. 100 lives. Now, only you people will live in this house. Banku will stay here... ...forever. You people can't leave this place. No. You people can't go. Is he still here? So, where is he right now? Kailash Nath loved his son very much. He offered many prayers for him in this temple. Now, he has got attached to your son. Priest, that's what we fear. What if he does any harm to Banku? No. Kailash has never caused anyone any harm. He won't do anything. Then, what should we do now? Post-death ceremony. We will have to do it for his soul to rest in peace. But only his son can do that. Yes, he should be the one to do it. Anyway, this rite hasn't been performed... ...after Kailash's death. Who would have done it? His son was abroad. Well, I have heard that he is here these days. Then, I'll meet and talk to him. If you heed my advice... ...then I think only your son can give Kailash his salvation. God answers to children's prayers. His prayers will surely be answered. Vijay. -Aditya. -Hello. I always visit this place, when I am in Goa. You come to Goa but never visit your home. You are staying at my place. You want us to get cleared from that house. I am bringing down Kailash Villa. This time, I will sell the land and leave Goa forever. Once I am done with that, all the stories about the ghost will rest. It's a spirit and not ghost. A disgruntled spirit of your dad. Disgruntled. Dissatisfied. Dad has always been dissatisfied with me. He could never understand me. Perhaps, you could never understand him. Vijay, your dad is attached to that house. He doesn't want the house that is full of your... ...mother's memories, to be demolished. Perhaps, that's why, his soul has still been wandering. Aditya, I don't believe such theories. I find it really funny that... ...my dad's soul troubles everyone, except me. He doesn't trouble anyone but gives a sense of his presence. You know a lot about my dad. The day you were leaving the house... ...your dad went after his son to stop him. He slipped,fell down and may be he had even screamed. But his son didn't turn around to look at him, even once. -That was an accident. -That's what you think. Do you think that I had killed my father? You don't know anything. I wasn't wrong. He couldn't understand a small problem of mine. Now, you can't understand such a small thing. Vijay, all you need to do is apologize. An apology to your father. Just come home and apologise to him once. Maybe his soul will rest in peace. Have you come here to advice me? No, I have come to inform you that we have kept... ...a prayer meeting for your dad's soul to rest in peace. We are performing a post death ceremony. These ceremonies aren't performed in America. But people still attain salvation. A son performs this rite for his Dad. So you do it. Prayer, veneration and all. Do as you please. I'll arrive the next day to take the keys of the house. Okay, I will surely keep some offerings for you. Anyway Vijay, even I didn't believe in all these things. But I agree that some things are always left incomplete. This prayer meeting too, will be incomplete without you. Tomorrow, we shall keep a small prayer meet for your Bhootnath. Really! Is it his birthday? For his rebirth and for his salvation. Salvation? What's that? Come here, Banku... You passed from grade one to grade two. Similarly, with this prayer meet, your Bhootnath... ...will become a star angel from an ordinary one. Star angel? I will go and inform him. Banku. Bhootnath, do you know... ... that I'm keeping a prayer meet for your salvation. Salvation? Yes. I went from grade one to grade two, similarly... ...you will become a star angel from an ordinary one. Just like my grandpa. -Look there. -Let me look. Let me look at you to my heart's content. I don't know, if I would be able to meet you again or not. Why? You too will look at me like grandpa does. Won't you? I will look at you. I will only be watching you. Promise me that you too will look at me everyday. Promise! But what if the clouds hide your face? Not even God can come between us. Promise me that you will never trouble your mother. I will trouble her If she doesn't give me ice cream. Promise me, that you will never leave your parents. So many promises at one go! Bhootnath, you will just get salvation. You are not going anywhere. Okay, this will be my last promise. Promise me, that you will never fight with anyone... ...and will always forgive everyone. -I won't forgive anyone. -No, it's necessary to forgive. Just as dirty clothes become clean after a wash... ...your heart becomes clear by forgiving others. Then, why didn't you forgive your son? Why does a person lead his life with the burden of exasperation? The one who forgives his enemy is free and is wise The wheel of time goes on, as the days pass by The night arrives When a small lamp is lit at night the flame is dim, yet it is the hope of a distant weary traveler, who after many years of journey, holds himself from falling down, in its faded light The wheel of time goes on as the days pass by The night arrives When a small lamp is lit at night the flame is dim, yet it is the hope of a distant weary traveler, who after many years of journey, holds himself from falling down, in its faded light The wheel of time goes on, as the days pass by The night arrives While I leave this world, I realize who my loved ones and strangers are While I leave this world, I realize who my loved ones and strangers are You're the only one I belonged to and you were the only one who kept up the love I can forfeit lust, anger and attachments. But, I can never forget you, even if I ever want to. I am bound eternally in your love. How can I attain salvation? Tell me. You do not realize the extent of my feelings towards you My heart melts when I gaze at you The wheel of time goes on, as the days pass by The night arrives I slept during day, I woke up when the night arrived I slept during day, I woke up when the night arrived Don't reach out for the sun now that it has set A river of love flowed years ago It is no more Don't lament over it now The wheel of time goes on as the days pass by The night arrives When a small lamp is lit at night the flame is dim, yet it is the hope of a distant weary traveler, who after many years of journey, holds himself from falling down, in its faded light The wheel of time goes on as the days pass by The night arrives -Please tell your name. -I am Vijay Nath. -Your clan? -Kashyap. Say that you shall pray for your dad's salvation. I pray for my dad, Mr Kailash Nath's salvation. How do I know what is salvation? Do not give me this excuse You taught me how to live -Don't leave me this like this. -Bhootnath? Dad, where's my Bhootnath? Your Bhootnath got salvation. But you said that... ...we are praying for his birthday. He went away. You were right. Some things are always left incomplete. I could never tell dad... I am sorry. I'm sorry that your Bhootnath left because of me. Tell him that this house will stay and it's yours from today. Then, please ask him to forgive me. The stars shine in the sky My eyes shed tears Where are you hiding? Bhootnath... -Bhootnath... -My angel. Bhootnath... Bhootnath, come down. Bhootnath... Come down, Bhootnath. Bhootnath! I can break free from life, but not from your love. I will come in front of you, whenever you call for me. -But don't tell this to anyone, okay? -Okay. Come here. You too must not tell it to anyone. Hey buddy, listen to me Let's have some fun Some mischief and devilry and some bloopers too Hey buddy, listen to me Let's have some fun Some mischief and devilry and some bloopers too Hey, nobody does it better No, no, no Hey, nobody does it better Hey, nobody does it better No, no, no Hey, nobody does it better No, no, no When I have a company like you all day all night Life is magical Isn't it so? My heart has different wishes Tell me, isn't that true? Just say what you wish, everything is possible Just laugh and be happy Every wish of yours would come true Hey, nobody does it better No, no, no Hey, nobody does it better Hey, nobody does it better No, no, no Hey, nobody does it better
