I will If you don't, I will come there Don't get so tense I will come there immediately Please come here... What's this? Why have they pushed the kidnapping case to us That's not our jurisdiction They say the Kid's school falls under our area Obviously, it's Mari who has kidnapped the child They won't survive if they interfere in his business Hence, smartly pushed it to us That's right But we can't stay away either They have kidnapped a Customs officers child There's a lot of pressure on us, what do we do? Come here Thirumurthy Mari has kidnapped the Customs Officer's child I am thinking of sending you Go and rescue the kid He's caught Everyone told me not to entrust this to a new guy But I have strongly recommended you Live up to it There, That's confirmation!

Don't beat it like that It will tear the surface You've spared the Culprits But have rounded us up He's right Why don't you announce this to the world outside? Did you crouch so much only to charge like this? You finished this in a jiffy, and we hardly felt a thing You've done this even without ruffling your uniform Who is that? Are you the one? You haven't just rescued the child... ...you have also safeguarded our reputation Proud of you You were stubborn about going alone Lions don't hunt in packs I haven't seen a braver Man in Thoothukudi!! - Doesn't he resemble me when I was younger and without a moustache? - Yes Sir Heard that... ...your Father and Grandfather were Policemen, it runs in your blood You are obviously living up to it No Sir We must learn from him We are singing his praises, yet, he is so matter of fact about it As if someone else, and not him, has done all this - This is the humility you need to learn - Yes Sir! This humility is going to take you places Give me that It's a sign of Valor, keep it Bless you Do you know who gave this to me? - Tell them - The old blacksmith... Why talk about old victories, let's talk about the new ones... Let's go Why are you sitting idle? Our boy has done no ordinary thing Let's hear it for him They are praising me to no end Everyone's admiring me, celebrating my feat Enjoy it, be happy I am kind of scared though What if they find out you did this and not me... I might have to arrest you myself No, they might handcuff us together and put us in the same Cell Why are you scaring me like this? We should have been identical twins like MGR in "Nadodi Manan" No one would have suspected a thing Why are you scared? Thiru or Guru either of us can question injustice "Police" blood runs in both our veins When Rowdies can hire henchmen why can't the Police do it? And what did you say... ...that this town has got some dangerous wild animals? Let's hunt them all down...! I can relax then Brainless guy! Where are you coming from? I just brought the Bike from the Showroom You had to do this right away Looks like you guys plan this Am sorry Why will anyone do this on purpose? Didn't you do this on purpose? An irritant early in the morning Are your eyes behind your head? Please listen to me, I'll get this repaired myself Please move, give me a minute Don't you dare touch the bike, I'll chop your hands off! - Gosh! He dropped it again! - The bike's dented! Get lost! You're dented yourself Does this even seem right? You've messed up my new bike! I just got it from the showroom this morning I spent so much time choosing the color Brainless guy! Pest!! Hello! I offered to set this right Please speak respectfully You don't deserve any respect No one is going to ceremoniously garland you for doing this Should get you caught with the Police Why are you screaming at the top of your voice? - The boy is offering to repair it - You mind your business He's grown as tall as a Palm Tree, why don't you question him?? Instead, you're asking me!! You look decent, but you're saying all the wrong things I am letting it go cause you're a woman What if I am a woman? Do you want me to turn a blind eye to everything you'll do? What the hell will you do? What will you do? Don't use that tone with me I can do that too... What can you do? What will you say to me? Get the hell out of here!!!! How dare you? See what I do to you I'll kill you today!! He is gone already There's a lot of rowdyism in this place That is what I said to you on the phone earlier I am not talking about the men, women are that way too What are you saying? I hit a girl's bike by mistake The way she yelled at me!! She's no woman She can speak for three people My god! Look at what he has done Why did you let him go? I had to behave decently in a crowd I didn't say much All she needed was a Trident She's a Killer Goddess! Why were you worried about decency? You can speak well Why didn't you cut him to size? I did give him a piece of my mind But that's not enough If I ever see him again, I'll squash him I kind of managed it, had it been you, she would have squashed you She has spoken quite a bit Should we book some case against her and put her behind bars? Not required! Its best not to deal with such women in life Fine then How can I give the same number to both of you? What are you saying Sir... it's my lucky number... That's why I am making a request... If you tell me who it is... I can speak to that Gentleman... He's that Gentleman... Why should I make a request to strangers... What are the formalities for this? I'll pay whatever it takes and get going... Sir... I have applied as well... This is my lucky number I'll pay any amount, I need this number I might give in even to my worst enemy, but not to her Who is he to give in for me Please tell me how much I should pay for it, I will Can't do anything if both of you keep fighting like this One of you needs to give in Ok sir!! I've decided to give in Very good! He has given in You can take the number I didn't give in I made a calculation The number is summing up to be 13 The devil's number Will suit her face - Give it to her! - Hey stop Who are you calling the devil? What audacity to call me the devil!! You are the devil!! Why are you running away? Stop!! - Coward! - Why are you screaming like the devil? What? Am I screaming like a devil? It's all because of him!! There he goes! Who is he? He damaged my bike that day and today he calls me the devil!!! Is that him... I didn't see his face... If I see his face again, I'll squash him He bragged about running his own business Now, they let things slip away!! Hey Surulai... ...had the same SI interfered in our work, what would we have done? We would have cut his hands and legs and fed the fishes with it We are working in the Seas... ...would help if he adds some salt in his food... There's just one Sea at Thoothukudi and only one Flag can be hoisted here Did you hear that You guys blundered Look at what the big guy is saying Are you happy now? - Don't get tense Mari - What do you mean? Stay calm Big Bro thinks this Policeman is just like the guys before him He's no ordinary guy He's young and fiery He will mess with them just like he did with us It will be a blast Let's step aside and watch the fun Tell me brother... Did your brother say anything about that girl? He didn't say anything We've known the family since your father's times Wanted him to see the girl and give us an answer It's been a week and no word yet Their family says it's a good day today and want him to go see her Ask him about it Is that so? I'll take care of it... - Bro... - Yes... Krishnamurthy just called Shut up! He doesn't have anything else to do Why? Don't you want to get married? You have a job isn't that the next step? Get lost! Do you have your eyes on any policewoman at the Station? Shut up What next? Are we going to cook our meals all our lives This is the right time Let's go see her All that's fine But going to their house won't work for me I feel shy - Why don't you go and see her? - Do I have to do this as well? Please... Why are you sitting like this? Aren't you ready yet? Why? Don't I look like a girl now? He can see me the way I am There's nothing to get ready The Groom looks superb Like him at the first sight of him We don't need to lay down any conditions He is super! Is that so... Take that eyebrow pencil... The groom hasn't come His brother has If he is fine with the girl, his brother will be okay too That's it!! Even when the groom sees me, they have a thousand problems Now one has to see me, and another has to approve!! This saree will do for him - Brainless guy!! Pest!! - Get the hell out of here!! - What? That girl?? - Thank god, we escaped! Krishnamurthy would have got us in to a soup He's not going to say good things about me anyway Am sure he will tell tales This marriage won't happen You needn't have fought so much Could have handled it peacefully - No, I think it will work out - What are you saying? You said she was a Killer Goddess She can speak for three... Yes, I did say that You are a little timid She's the right one to be by your side She must have a lot of guts to speak up in front of so many men She said the right things I was at fault too! I hit her bike She can't sweet talk Can't sweet talk The fault is his you don't support him It's different when you see her at home Is that what you say?

Why are you so proud of it? If you stay this way, you cannot do a thing Don't think you can relax like this forever Look at finding a job for yourself - How can I follow you if two people speak at the same time? - What? What's up Inspector? You acted smart with us Big Bro's goods are on the move today... ...why don't you try showing your bravery there It's about the goods, isn't it?

I underestimated him and let it slip away He seems to be quite a guy! His father and grandfather were Policemen He's arrogant cause he's got that blood in him Are you singing his praises to me? What shall we do? He has interfered in our business We'll do something for sure We must scare him Who are the people with him? What's his weakness? The boys say he has a brother He hangs around idly Should we get him Get him!! How can I eat the whole chicken by myself? When you can do so much by yourself, can't you eat this?

That's right We can clean up Thoothukudi with more people like you You are not someone meant for ordinary tasks, you should be doing greater things If you hand over the goods in Court... I am sure you'll become the Superintendent of the Anti smuggling wing Give it to me It's missing Sir He's going to hand over the goods in the Tirunelveli Court tomorrow I don't know what you'll do, the goods shouldn't reach the Court tomorrow Why did you burn all the goods? I've said I will hand them over at the Tirunelveli Court What do we do now? Am I a fool to burn it? - All the goods are in the Train - What are you saying? - Come - Where? When did you load this? I got this in even before their men got in to the Train Super Brother!! - Super Brother!! - Way to go!! You slipped up!!! He has handed it over in Court He loaded the goods even before our men got in to the Train He's not just strong, he's intelligent as well It's pointless to confront him He's playing a different game We should play it differently too How are you? Hope you are doing well You are from my hometown... You've seen me since childhood Won't you tell him about me...? He's married to a girl from my town, hence have made a decision He didn't seize my goods, nor did I load them Surulai, keep it there Keep it Starting today, I will send in a share each time my goods move place - Understand Surulai? - Get up! I said get up! Do you know who you're talking to? Who are you trying to buy? You've not met a real man before this If any one stood up to you, you've always transferred them... Or chopped their hands or legs off... or burnt them isn't that what you do? Now that a man is ready to confront you, are you scared? Face him head on, if you are a real Man Instead, you are here to strike a bargain and bring him to your side If he even sees this, he'll shoot you like you were little birds... There's no guarantee for your life, if you stay here a minute longer Leave this place right away! Go! When did you come? Were you listening to everything? Did I play the part of a Policeman's wife well? The whole place is scared of him Won't I be happy when a man like him is scared of you...?

Everyone around you believes you are a real Policeman Why can't you believe that about yourself? If there was meaning to the Police Uniform our dad and grand dad wore...
