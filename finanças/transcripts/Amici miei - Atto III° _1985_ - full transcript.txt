VOICES SINGING IN CHORUS "THE BARBER OF SEVILLE SINGING "THE BARBER OF SEVILLE" (Necchi) Puttana Eva, how they have aged! It seems that Sassaroli has a ten kilos watermelon ten kilos under his shirt. Since Melandri is retired it seems to me that he is even shorter. After the scare of six years ago and the death of his wife... ...Count Mascetti could only get better. I look like Fanfani! If they see me as I see them... ...instead of "The Barber of Seville", we should sing the "De profundis". ♪ A poor man died at the hospital... ♪ ...with the urinal he poured himself. ♪ ♪ Citizens, run with the rope... ♪ ...a priest fell in the shit. ♪ ♪ Everyone says this: "Quant'è bella Mimì !" ♪ The wildest panties in the village. ♪ ♪ Twenty-one, thirty-one twenty-one, thirty-one...♪ ♪ The servant of our curate Had a fly between her thighs... ♪ ...and the priest, a rather shady figure, removed the fly and put the... ♪ ...twenty-one, thirty-one, twenty-one, thirty-one... ♪ ♪ My father, I have committed a great sin... ♪ ...perhaps you will forgive me. The other night we were alone me and my beloved... ♪ ...he put his hand on my chest. ♪ With that other cheeky one, while I didn't want to... ♪ ...he allowed himself to touch me... LA YULA LA YULA THERE ♪ After a day's work he was tired as a mule... ♪ ...and he put it three times in my... LA YULA LA YULA LALLÀ ♪ LAUGHTER (Necchi) Yes, but our friendship does not grow old... ...because inside we continue to be between 12 and 16 years old... ...with the same desire to laugh and to be together. In fact we are doing a trip in honor of Mascetti... ...and we go around being silly. - Where do I go? - We had to go to visit Puccini's house. - We could take a trip to the park. - Puccini on the right and park on the left. - Let the birthday boy decide. - Mascetti, let's do what you want. - Culture or ecology? - Carousels. Off to the rides ! Hey! Push ! Push. I'm not going in, too bad. Here. It's very wide ! - This car doesn't steer well. - What are you doing? - It looks like it fits and it doesn't. - I know why ! You've been drinking again today ! Let me feel your breath ! - Let me try again. - No, let's go home ! Thank you. - Four carbines. - For shooting. - Here. - All right. (Necchi) I aim for the chalks. - Here, to you. - I aim at the balloon in the center ! Careful not to hit the presents. Guys, don't pull on the presents. High ball ! (Necchi) High to the right chalks ! - Halt ! It's over, there's nothing left ! - And the prizes ? Where do we go now ? Stop, you can't go up. - I'm sorry, but it's forbidden. - To whom? - To children and old people. - Old will be your grandfather. - And that slut of a grandmother of yours. - What? I am professor Sassaroli, a well-known luminary of science. The gentlemen are my patients, this is my medical card. I guarantee their heart system and their psychophysical balance. - Then have a seat. - Thank you. Fasten your seat belts. Go, Charon! COMPLAINTS I told you so ! Call someone, the old people are sick. Down. Watch out for the wheel. Don't make that face. It is the best rest home in Florence and it's also very expensive. Alright, Count Mascetti will end his life in an old people's home. - Except if you have changed your mind. - No. Maybe you feel a little remorse, a little shame. - No. - Of course, I had to imagine that. At least you, Melandri. We were good together. - I used to keep you company. - Too much. - Living alone, I filled your house. - With whores, that I had to pay for. No, I can't. Where do I make you sleep? In the bar? What about me? In the clinic mortuary ? Mascetti, we have done everything we could do. Alright, you are monstrously selfish... ...but I thank you all the same. - Sure, we pay for everything. - Your wheelchair costs more than a car racing car! - Bravo, very delicate ! - We'll walk you in. - No. - And the suitcase? - Here. For you I don't exist anymore. Send me the chrysanthemums on November 2nd. I wonder if we did well. Of course we did well, he didn't have a home anymore. He didn't eat, everything was always dirty. At least here they will take care of him. (Necchi) We will respect his last will and will, we will not look for him anymore. Also because we don't want to know how he lives in there. It's too painful the idea that Mascetti is closed in an old people's home. - Melandri, what do you want at this hour? - Coffee. - It is closed. - It's 6:30, the other cafes have been open for half an hour. Then go get it at another bar, or rather go get it in the ass! Damn you! - Madam, are we going to the market today? - I went there yesterday. I can accompany you today as well. We do our shopping every other day. Tomorrow then? - Do you want me to help you? - To do what? I can help you, sweep the floor ? No thanks, I do it myself. I'm used to it. And you don't have to unaccustom yourself. - Go take a walk, architect. - I've been around since 4:00. So, if you don't need any help, I'll read you my last poem. - I'm going to go wash up. - Wait, it won't be long. - Dog. - What? - It's the title. "The poor old hound Is prowling in the garden..." "...dragging his shaky legs and his camouflaged face." Dogs don't have faces, they have snouts. - I know, but "muzzle-camuso" sounds bad. - Poetic license... I'm going to go wash up. "Surely he searches in a hurry for someone..." "...who caresses him on the head And under his bearded chin." Do dogs have chins ? - What do you call it ? - At most, "bazza". It's not poetic. The shaved chin... Dogs don't shave ! Shaved due to old age ! - There is a meaning, try to understand. - What ? Let him read this poem ! "Love, pity." "With no more teeth or flair..." "...poor old dog..." "...poor old lost friend of mine." - Did you understand? - Yes, I understood that he is a dog... ...with a face, with a shaved chin and that he also has mange! It is a metaphor, this dog is Mascetti! It is a poem for Mascetti ! I wonder how he is, how he is reduced... PHONE RINGING The telephone... Bar Restaurant Necchi. It's you, how are you? It's him... Tell me. I also need a ten year old boy, rent him from a gypsy girl. I'll mark it down: "ten-year-old boy for rent." You'll see, it'll be something epic. I'll call you, I don't pay anyway. - You didn't tell me how you are. - I'm fine here, bye. I'm glad you're doing well here... ...but I remind you that for the guests there is a pay phone in the hall. - Yes, but the FILICUDA of the SBRINDELLONA how did it do? - I beg your pardon? I tried with SUPERCAZZORA with SCAPPELLING, but it doesn't work. - In what sense? - In the ANAFESTIC sense. - Maybe for ANDICAPO of altitude. - Is the phone too high ? No, he didn't understand. I was saying that if it was with the finger, going down and up... Follow your finger, up and down. If it goes down, it doesn't go up and vice versa. - Ask the nun to help you. - That's what I was saying. - Don't call here anymore. - Sure. ♪ How delicious it is to go in the wheelchair... ♪ ...on the wheelchair On the arm of my beauty. ♪ Sorry, the clutch is slipping. It slips every morning, at least not at my table ! - Coffee? - Just milk. - Just coffee. - There is no bread. Sister? - I'll get it for you. Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. IMITATES THE TRUMPET OF THE FLAG RAISING - Wake up, General ! Good morning ! - Good morning, Count. Sorry if I woke you up, but you're still dressed for breakfast. - It's 10:00. - 10:00? That's right, I'm late. I have to go get dressed for "promenade". Thank you very much, Mr. Count. Respecting the rules is my secret. At our age, if we let ourselves go, it's the end. Sister, the sawdust ! You always hide the prosthesis, I never find it. Here it is, he has to keep it in his ear. With just one, you don't hear anything. SPEAK IN GERMAN You don't hear when I call you nor the lunch bell, understand? - I understand. (Mascetti) Mrs. Poggibollini! The nuns don't understand anything. Sound waves are best transmitted through the body. A recent scientific discovery says to use the device... ...rectally, understand? - No. With respect, if you put it In the asshole he feels better. Try. Mr. Mascetti ! I need to get the brakes serviced, what's up? I cut out the article on the ancient legends of Casentino. Interesting. If you BLINK the BREMATURATED SUPERCAZZOR... ...I care about SEGA. - How? Mr Lenzi ! Mr. Lenzi, have you seen Cecco? I think he's back there, but maybe it was yesterday. You are terrible, Mr. Lenzi. You make all the women fall in love. For example, those two beautiful girls they confessed it to me. - They are both in love with her. - Maybe! When I was young, I was with three women at once. I was with ten women In one day, I had it in granite. Congratulations. ♪ I'll pick you up tonight in my blue torpedo. ♪ Cecco, I've been looking for you for an hour. I'm out of flies. - I'm out of money. - I want five ounces of it. - And the camera? - I put it in his room. Mark that too, by Saturday everything must be ready. If the director notices, she'll fire me. What do you care? Working is not the most important thing. - And what is it? - Laughing. (Mascetti) Always laughing! Laughing... "You utter phrases That make me smile." (woman) "Your smile is so contemptuous." (man) "You don't know the truth." - "Then tell me, if you dare." - "My secret is in my heart." (woman) "Why?" "We both know the secret Is in your uncle's dark heart..." Enough. Enough with these anti-cultural. How do you form yourselves? You grow up as a bunch of ignorant people. - Give me. - Why? No! There is a program just for us about old age... ...that talks about our problems social and human problems. "Third Age Television wishes you a good morning." "Repeat for the arteriosclerotic, have a nice day." Our programs will begin with a short space... ...for advertising. "Time passes inexorably." "In your bed you sleep only some nights..." "...In the coffin you will sleep forever." - What is it? - A new net, I've never seen it. Shut up, silence! "Choose our coffins with padding proofed for eternal sleep." Menagramo ! "Remember..." "...Buonanima Brothers enterprise, via del Purgatorio 17." Interesting, did you get the address ? "Trapassi Brothers, viale dei Cipressi 47." Let's put the interval. Come. IMITATES THE MUSIC OF THE INTERVAL Hurry. Come on ! Come on ! "My maternal grandfather's butt concerns me greatly." "It's always wet and inflamed." "My paternal grandfather's butt is always candied." - What kind of television is this? - Be quiet, it's a free network. Free ass! "My grandfather always uses Mingo, the diaper for old pissers." "You use it too." "Now our programs continue with a science column..." "...given by the holder of the chair of senescence and decomposition..." "...of the university." - It must be seen. "The famous Professor Rambaldus." "Today we will attempt an experiment Of remote collective hypnosis." "Of course not all of you will be subjected to my fluid..." "...but only certain subjects more sensitive." "Stare carefully into this mirror And try not to think about anything." That's just fibs ! I am refractory. "Two, three, four... "I feel the return fluid." "Some of you have fallen asleep And will obey me." "Let no one try to wake him up, it would be dangerous." "Open your eyes, now you will take a journey backwards in your life." "Backwards, backwards, backwards. You're 18 years old." "For the first time you enter into a brothel." "You finally know lust." Come here, beauty ! He's dangerous, he's been hypnotized. You satisfy him, come back ! "You are now entering your early childhood, you are four years old." "You eat, but what you eat you don't like." Poop ! "It's your birthday." "You've been given a saber to be a warrior." Come on, Savoy ! "That's it, bravo ! Give vent to your instincts !" "Very good !" "So you won't have complexes when you grow up." What's going on ? - Mr. Mascetti! - Don't wake him up, he's in trance! (Mascetti) Shut up! - "The experiment is successful." "You will wake up to the sound of the... gong !" Oh my god, what happened ? - What have you done to me? - What did you do? Nothing, I was watching TV. "There will now be a bi-weekly broadcast of senile sexology entitled..." "...'Dry bush, moldy pea'." What does it do ? This is Mr. Mascetti's room! "What is this?" SPEAK IN GERMAN Telefunken ! - Kamasutra. - SCAPPELLATION to the right. - SUKATO MELAI. - Funeral, many funeral. - They will hunt Mascetti! - For goodness sake, he'll come back with us. - But no, we'll send her flowers. - Two crowns of scarlet roses. - Will you accompany me? - I can't, my niece is here. Ivana, are you sleeping? Wake up, Ivana. - I'm hungry. - Now let's go eat. Sit forward. - The granddaughter on whose side? - "On the side of fava," goodbye to all. - Shall I come with you? - Yes, I must also bring the imbecile back to my cousin. - At this hour there is traffic, get in. - Sorry... ...I don't feel able to drive anymore, I don't have the reflexes. Don't worry, after a while I'll stop breaking your balls. Wake up ! "Who wants to see the dawn, leave the soft feathers", Fogazzaro. I don't want to see the dawn. Damn you, Fogazzaro and to whoever opens the door for you. It's 6:30, we have a lot to do! I miss work. - I don't. - Of course, you have never worked! - Yes, I have this advantage. - Lucky you, but I... You don't know how hard it is not to do anything all your life. Mascetti, you were right, now I feel good! I looked everywhere ! - Good morning, gentlemen. - Good morning. - May I? - Please do. - Are you new? - No, I have been in Naples to visit my nephews. Bravo. Nice day, isn't it? - Yes, beautiful day. - It looks nice, but it's going to rain tonight. - Do you think it will rain? - Yes, it will rain. - We hope not. - Instead it will rain. I feel like we're having a conversation like old farts. That's exactly right, but I'm here Because I do small services... ...to earn some money. I offer first aid against the rain. Object recovery... ...forgotten in the garden: 1000 liras. Watch an episode lost on TV: 500 lire. If one is cold, I offer heating in the bed with human heat. I also assume blame for indiscipline for a price to be agreed upon. VERSI - Do you also do things not listed ? - Sure, what should I do? Follow the general... ...and without realizing it, imitate the sound of the water. - How many times? - Four. - 1000 liras. Give it to him, come on. - Thank you. - Go. IMITATES THE SOUND OF WATER (Necchi) Death is discreet, almost gentle, in the rest homes. One morning she looks out of a window disguised as a slammed mattress. Everyone sees her, but they pretend not to see her. - Are you sure he's dead? - Sure, it's the room next to mine. - Thank goodness. - How is it good? - Better him than someone else... ...when he snored he looked like an electric saw. - I have to leave. - You just arrived. And now I'm leaving. - Good morning, Mr. Mascetti. - Good morning. - What a beautiful day! - Let's start again... - It looks beautiful, but it's going to rain. - But if there isn't a cloud ! Exactly, I like it when it rains. No, she likes to be rude, but I ask her anyway. - There is a flowering lilac after the lawn. - Long live the lilacs! In the hen house the chicks are born, are they coming ? - I can't, the accumulators are empty. - I'll push it. I've been watching her for a while... ...and I have not yet understood what kind of person you are. A person that it is better not to frequent. RUSSING - Sister, is 22 dead or not? - Yes. - Why does he keep snoring? - I don't know. - Listen. SNORING - Did you hear that? - Yes, it's a new guest. Do you put them all next to me? RUSSARE Hey! - Melandri? - Yes. - What are you doing here? - What do you think I'm doing? Sleeping. - I had been applying for a while. - To come here ? - The room opened up and I decided. - Why didn't you tell me ? - I wanted to surprise you. - Yes, of course... The truth is that you were ashamed. Yeah. - It happened to me too. - I didn't want to go there. I didn't either. Outside I didn't know what to do, I was breaking my balls. - It's old age. - Old age is When you break the balls of others. You broke everyone's even when you were young. - Do you think you are old? - Not at all! I'm the same as before, even better. But here we are. There must be something wrong... ...or unfair. Who knows? - Do you want a cigarette? - I quit. I'll start again right away ! You didn't come here just to be with your friend, did you ? - What is it? - The rules of the house. No going out after 10pm, no late lunches... ...complaints are made in writing, etc. You learn it by heart - Other ? - These are the rules... ...then there are the tips. Third age is a difficult time, Mr. Melandri. - Architect Melandri. - Do you have phenomena of morning erections? Yes, phenomenon is the right word. In 99% of cases it's the prostate, don't brag too much. I recommend you get yourself examined. Also for hygienic reasons... ...I recommend to all male guests of a certain age... ...to pee sitting down like women. - Do you pee standing up like a man? - Mr. Melandri ! The architect Melandri pees as he wants, even on one foot. - Mr. Melandri ! - And I'll make her shake it off! - And I never miss. - Sister! I hit a coin at seven yards, like Buffalo Bill ! Look at all ! (Melandri) Hold on, I can't find it. Don't run away, I have it like a fire hydrant! And I also have erections in the evening... ...in the afternoon and at noon, before and after meals. I use it to crush nuts ! Let's toast to our new guest, the architect Melandri. What a great idea, you eat so bad with dentures. RICE - Sister, it's tough. - Sister, it's not heifer ! - Sister, can you cut it ? - Sister, can you chop it ? (together) Sister, can you suck it ? (together) Sister, it is not heifer ! - Complaints are only made in writing. - We are old. - This is a very dirty thing ! No, they are false teeth. Look at the beautiful smile we have. I'll throw them out right away. I'll throw this one away too ! No, one moment ! That one is mine ! - The straws! - Yes, do the snot! One for me too. - What are you doing, pig? - Imbecile, what's wrong with you? - We always have to be recognized ! - By whom? By that lady, she is different. You have to stop fooling around. - What is the name of that lady? - Amalia Pecci Bonetti. - She has two surnames and blue eyes like a fairy. - Let's start again. No, for fuck's sake. Do you fall in love here too? - Then you have a chronic disease ! - Did you see her or not ? - I am always at your disposal. - Go ahead. General Mastrostefano. Holy crap, I'm late. Flowers. If you allow, I will show you the park. - I am Stefano Lenzi. - Architect Rambaldo Melandri. (Necchi) There is a lot of competition, but Melandri will prevail over all... ...because the others are suitors, instead he is a suitor. - Guess what he's telling her. - "The Walk" by D'Annunzio. I didn't think, he only felt. Say, you were never convalescent in a somewhat cloudy April? No, I always get sick in November, at the first cold. Madam, these are verses by D'Annunzio. They say that in the thick of the foliage... ...you have a red lock of hair like a flame, is it true? No, I have never been red. - Madam, it's always D'Annunzio! - Ah, yes. You don't love me either, and I don't love you. - It's a little early. - Amalia. By now he has won, too bad. What a woman! If I were still 70 years old... You know that until recently, until a thousand... - 1964 ? - No. - 1968 ? - No. - 1970 ? That's right, I was still riding a horse as a... - A Cossack? - No, a... - A cow-boy? - No... it's an Italian name. - A cowboy. - Good, a cowboy. What did he say about cowboys? No, she said he rode like a cowboy. For a bet I used to attach myself with my hands to a branch... ...I clenched my thighs and pulled myself up together with the horse. I was a perfect man, instead now I have to make room for young people. Old age... It is better to kill yourself if there is no remedy for old age. (Necchi) I don't know how I get I don't know how I come up with such divine, indeed diabolical ideas... ...but I tell him... There is a remedy! How old do you think he is? - 64, 65 years old. - 65 years old... 95 years old. Of course, he says it to brag! He went to school with my father. In 1920 he had an affair with my mother, maybe I am her son. What did he do? Any new American cures ? Yoga? Tibet ? Gerovital ? What a cure ! LAUGHTER - Excuse me if I laugh in a satanic way. - Dr. LUCI rather FERO. - Shut up! Are you crazy? - Why are you telling him to shut up ? Nothing. Go away, don't try to know. Stay away from us, we are cursed. Are you crazy? I regret I made you do the deal. Sooner or later everyone will notice I'm getting younger. You're unconscious ! A black mass is a secret, not to be talked about. Never talk about the pact with anyone. - Good morning, looking very good today. - Feeling really good. Look. Until a week ago I was suffering from total paralysis. Improvement is slow, but steady. - Covenant says. - What ? The covenant says six months. WHISPERS INCOMPREHENSIBLE WORDS Continue. Explain. I can't... I still feel good, yesterday you were talking about Yesterday you were talking about pact, black mass... ...of Dr. Divago... - What is your name? - Doctor Faust. Are you afraid of selling your soul to the devil to become young again? Don't make me laugh, I want to kill myself! Of course I would sell his soul, but how can I believe it ? Look at me, do you want me to try again ? Damn. - Who is that? - The intermediary. A rather HAPPY MEFIST guy. She ! She is a chosen one. When he is around someone, you can't escape him. You are surrounded by a black fluid. Have you ever had paranormal phenomena, impressive visions ? - No. - He will have them. - Can I have a light? - Right away. CARÓ, CARAI, CARABAI... Come on, Count. I have some mediumistic news for you. SHORTNESS OF BREATH Here, I give you Florence. I'll make a carpet out of it for you. - D'annunzio. - No, me. Rambaldo. ...you wheeze. For the passion. I'm panting, too. Yes, we pant together. - Good evening. - Good evening. How beautiful, how youthful tonight is. Did he put makeup on his eyes to please someone? No need, for example I prefer her without makeup. - I put on makeup for just that reason. - Thank you, you are always nicer. Enjoy your meal. Mr. Lenzi, excuse me, can you bring me a knife? - They forgot to put it in. - Right away. They never put them in for me. Thank you. Is it your presence, do you want to stop with this black fluid of yours ? So I can't even eat. Go away, "vade retro". - See you later, sweetheart. - Thank you, dear. Sister. - Well? - She is wonderful. It's beautiful, it's... I don't know how to tell you. It's like an alabaster urn. It has a scent of purity, a gentle mystery... - Wonderful, wonderful. - But have you had sex? - Are you waiting for her to come of age? - I'm waiting for my wedding night. - Whose? - Ours, I want ask her in marriage to her relatives. - When ? - Thursday. Of course I'm coming. Don't worry, I'll warn Sassaroli. - See you Thursday, bye. - Where are you going on Thursday? - At Mascetti's. - Again? You are always in that hospice! It is not a hospice, but a beautiful mansion. They have a princely garden, they live like Popes and it's cheap. It's okay, I don't care. Carmen, I told you so that you don't think wrong things. Hello? Professor Sassaroli, please. It's urgent. No, you disturb him. It can't be a case more urgent than mine. Tell him "Melandri case" and you will see the scalpel falls from his hand. Thursday is the closing day... ...of this cursed place. - Why is it cursed? I'm starting to hate it, this club will kill us both. - Especially you, how you are reduced ! - Me? Look at the dark circles under your eyes! What a destroyed face! You work too much for your age, look at those swollen legs. - They don't. - They look like sausages... ...inflated with a pump ! Sassaroli, listen to the news about Melandri. Yes. Sis, what should we do on Thursday? - That kidney transplant. - Let's postpone it. - It's a hopeless case. - Exactly, let's be cautious. Let's redo all the tests. Alright, see you Thursday. Hi. I told you, it's like a hotel. The rooms all have bathrooms. - Come on! - Go on, I'll catch up with you. - Do you like it ? - Yes, it's nice. Come on, I'll show you the park. Here are the ladies, some are knitting knitting, others are playing cards... - Do you want to make friends? - Why do I have to make friends? Come, I'll introduce you. Ladies, let me introduce you to my wife. I'll be right back. (speaker) "The closing time for visitors is 19:30." Count Mascetti, Professor Sassaroli... ...dear friends, almost brothers. The lawyer Pecci Bonetti, brother of Amalia, his wife... Mrs. Arnaldi, wife of the engineer Arnaldi... ...the son-in-law of Amalia, her wonderful grandchildren... ...Miss Lilly... - Milly. - Milly, the granddaughter. - "From fava." - What ? - Nothing, dear. - Another friend, Mr. Necchi. - Where are you going on your honeymoon? To the caves of Monsummano? Excellent for lumbar arthrosis. Go to Lourdes, so I can come too. We will honeymoon in the villa of Amalia, in Forte dei Marmi. - Rambaldo and I are going to live there. - In the villa? You promised me! Good, you came here because you were sad and wanted company... ...and now you leave me alone and go away with it. - Between you and her there is no comparison, here. - I don't drink with Judas, I'm going away. Mascetti! - Mascetti! - Come on, stop it! General, do something. If you let it be stolen from that old fart? A gentleman must know how to lose. The lady has chosen and I respect her will. May she be happy, at least. - Mr. Count, come a moment. - I'm coming, Miss. - The gentleman who wants to marry my grandmother a friend of yours? - He was. - He seems like a good person and that she loves him. - I hate him. That's not true, that's why I'm telling her. My grandmother is a whore, you see ? - Sure. - She had sex with everybody. He did it everywhere, in the cabins at the beach, in the phone booths... ...in the bushes, in the cellar... - She was also with my boyfriend. - Do you want to take revenge for the villa? Sure, I'm mad about the mansion, but also for the fiancé. Try playing footsie with my grandmother. Me? Foot? It's not easy ! Love is born in the most unexpected most unexpected. It is a mystery, but it is always extraordinary, always new. I came here to withdraw from the world... ...and instead I met love. A great love and a great family. For me you are already as my children and my grandchildren. To me you are already my brothers, my cousins and my brothers-in-law... ...because I consider myself already married to her. Yay! KISS (Necchi) Here we have to make a decision... ...tell Melandri what the reality is... ...or to keep silent pitifully? What a problem! (Necchi) And then we have to deal with Lenzi and Beelzebub... ...how much work! - Hi, Cecco. - Good night. - Good night. Now let's all go to sleep. Good night, Mr. Lenzi. - Good night. - Happy dreams. - Same to you. See you tomorrow. URLA Help! Run, there is a goat! Do you see a goat? - Have you seen it? - I didn't see anything. What do you mean nothing? Look at the smoke coming out ! - You materialize an ectoplasm, in satanic terms. - What is happening ? - Help! - Another goat? This is an owl. - Do you see an owl? - No. - We don't see any owl. - It's here, on the armchair. - Do you see an owl on the armchair ? - No. - We don't see any owl. - Look at it, it's here ! You are materializing too much. It happened to us too. Right, Melandri? - Good night, Mr. Lenzi. - Good night. - What did you do? - Nothing. - Is an owl in the room normal? - And paranormal. But you don't understand anything these days. - We have the wrong room. - No, it plays a little to fall asleep. Since I suffer from insomnia... It's not bad, is it ? - Why don't you sleep at this hour ? - I'd like to talk to you alone. Mr. Capecelato, that's enough for tonight. - Sure, but I came. - Sign on my account. Again? Always at your disposal, good night. Good night. I received it today. It's an anonymous letter. "Amalia is easy-going, she gets fucked by dogs and fucked by dogs and pigs. A friend." - Really? - What? It is a slander, it is an infamous slander ! In your place, I wouldn't be so peremptory. - If he is a friend, he does it for your own good. - What a friend, he's an accursed pig! He is one of these old men, an envious, or jealous or...
