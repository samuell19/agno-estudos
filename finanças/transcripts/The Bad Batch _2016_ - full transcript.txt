I don't even really know what it is. Do you? You're big. Strange, isn't it? Here we are in the darkest corner of this Earth, and we're afraid of our own kind. Hmm. You know where you are? You are a long way from Comfort. And without this, you go nowhere. Did you see a kid look like that? Did you see her? No. I'm going to take you to Comfort, and you will go inside and find her for me.

What's your deal? How come you're in the Bad Batch? Gang related? Drug related? Illegal. No papers. You a Mexican? Cubano, from Havana. I heard of Cuba. That's in the tropics, right? Near Hawaii? Here is Cuba. I am born here, in Havana. I come with a boat to America when I'm 16. To Miami. Miami. What did you do there? Like, what did you do in Miami? A lot of thing. I make tattoos, construction. I do this, that. No big deal. I got this one when I was 13. And this. See this one? It's from the first boy I ever loved. He was a musician. We both got matching ones at the same time. And this one, 5040. What's your number? Come on. What's your number? What's the big deal? Just show me your number. Your kind, you're evil. That's what you are. Evil. You don't see things how they are. You only see things how you are. I don't care. I hate you. Get it? I hate all of y'all. No problema para mí. It's okay. Doesn't change nothing for me. Doesn't change nothing for you. Ohh. Ohh! Come on. Come with me. Come on. Let's go, man. I'm getting the fuck out of here. Come on. Hurry the fuck up. Let's go now. Open up. Close it up. - What's up, man? - Hey, what's going on? What's your number, fool? 5828. Been out in the desert two days, man. I need some food. Are you guys gonna help me out or what? What's up with the white girl, man? Found her ass out there with one of them Bridge people. All right, kick back, homey. - Thanks, man. - Welcome to Comfort ese. Yeah, welcome to Comfort. Excuse me. Have you seen this kid? No. You seen this kid? No. Excuse me, sir. Have you seen this kid anywhere? Uh-uh. No? Can you look out for her, please? Oh, he ain't ever gonna be wasted. Hey, have you guys seen a little girl? I ain't seen shit, man. I wish they'd stop making pennies. I hate pennies. I hate 'em! Hey! - I keep losing things. - Hey. Don't wanna be a loser. I wanna be a finder. Finder finds things. Loser loses them. Yeah. I need to find a kid. A little girl. Yeah. - She's about this tall. - Yeah. - You've seen her? - Yeah. - Where? - Hey, you wanna play with my puzzle? You wanna play? No, I'm not gonna play with your puzzle. - Thank you. - I'll call you later. Yeah, baby! Woo! It's happening! Yeah. Yeah, baby. Take a good look there. That's the economy of Comfort sitting right in front of you. Right beautiful. See, you can catch more flies with honey. But who wants flies? Remind me your name again, Sweetheart. It's Arlen. Let me ask you a question, Arlen. When you shit here in Comfort, your shit goes away. That accurate? I guess. You shit. It leaves. You know why it leaves? Um... because the toilet takes it some place? Yes, it does. Takes it where it takes it... because of me. 'Cause I hate the idea that my sons and daughters would have to stew in their own shit. Cows stand in their shit. They stand in their shit... 'cause they're cows. Pigs stand in their shit... 'cause they're pigs. Some misbehaving humans been making hamburgers out of my sons and daughters. We are not cows. We don't stand in our shit. Reason we don't... is because I won't let that happen. I got each and every toilet in Comfort taking that shit from all your little asses and sending it down the pipes till it reaches a place where no one thinks about it and no one smells it. Ain't that nice of me? But you don't like it here, do you? No, I just... Costs a lot to be here. Cost you an arm and a leg. Where would you rather be? It's all right. You know what I see when I look at you? A sailboat out in the sea... with no wind. What is it you want, Arlen? If you could have one thing, anything, what would it be? Anything? Anything at all. A time machine. Why? So I could go back. Fix things. Make it better. All the things you've done have put you right here, on this couch, in this room, with me. Close your eyes. Close them. What do you really want? I wanna be the solution for something. You know what this is? It's a tomato. First, it was a seed. You take care of a garden, and it takes care of you back. You feed it, it feeds you. Few things in this world operate like that, fair and square. It just needs a place to grow. It grows and grows. Then it comes out and it's part of the world. Because you know what The Dream really is? It's life. Life is The Dream. The only dream. I want The Dream. What dream is that? This one here. Like they have. Make up a room for our guest. Is everything okay? Hey. I'm sorry. I guess I'm just a bit nervous. That's okay. Can you come in for a second? Yeah, of course. Is this really necessary? Come here, kid. We're going. Bring her down! You wanna see it all over your fucking walls? Come here. Promise me something. Take care of this rabbit. Come on. Yeah. When we're out and clear of the wall, I'll let her go. Come here. Let's go, kid. I'm real disappointed in you, Arlen. Real disappointed. Once we're out, I'll let her go. I swear. Yo, check this shit out right here, homes. - Open it, Nacho. - Open the gate, homes. Open it! Come on. Bye, guerita. Don't come back, you crazy bitch. Get in the front. Come on. Miel. You good? Okay? Hey. Wait. What are you doing right now? Do you wanna hang out or something? You are very confused, no? Not really. What you think I am, gringa? What if all these things that happened to us happened to us so the next things that gonna happen to us can happen to us? You brought back my kid. You done now. You can go. Go back to Comfort. I'm not going back there. In this place is only death for you. Is like that. Well, I like it here. What do you like? Where is here? Look around. Is nothing. I want spaghetti because the other man gave me spaghetti. I want spaghetti. I'm hungry. I want spaghetti! I want spaghetti!
