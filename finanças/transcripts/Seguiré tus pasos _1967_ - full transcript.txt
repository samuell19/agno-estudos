Have you already checked this place out? I'll wait for you at this very spot after the race. Look very carefully at what you have to do. Yes, I know. It's not my first time. But now they're running for fifty thousand golden Sols. Even if they were running for lots more money, by hobbling the other horses you can't lose. And what are we going to call ourselves now? Well...I'll be Jacinto. And you, whatever. In the last village, you were Crescencio, right? What now? I'm thinking about the lady who asked me if I was an orphan. She stood with her mouth open when I said I had three moms! Nosy bitch! But it's not for nothing, son. But you should rather have explained to her that you have three,... because your mom, my wife, left us long ago. I cannot and will not ever want another woman. And if you really loved my mom, then why have I had other moms? When a man has several women,... it's because you haven't stopped loving one. Do you understand me? Yes, Dad. Hey: and now we'll never go back to Mexico? Someday, son,... when my memories don't hurt me so deeply. And it's a while since we've seen my moms, right? Just because we've been wandering around homeless. But with our winnings on this race, we're going to buy a big gift for each of them. What now? You and I have always told each other our thoughts, and shared each other's blues. Yet now I can't hear your blues no matter how hard I try. What gives? Son, I know nothing in life besides these three things:... Lucero our horse, our guitar, and you. I know when Lucero is sad,... I know when the guitar is out of tune,... and I also know when something's going on behind your eyes. I'm going to be lying right here, looking at the sky, until you share your thoughts. You're a real man, right? Well, that's my reputation, son. Then why do you always you cheat in racing? It seems to me that you think you won't win anything by being straight. I've always thought that the game of life, from beginning to end, is rigged, son. Now mind you: I get myself in danger, I bet my own life in the game, and I'm always risking my life. Of course, Dad, I just can't keep my big mouth shut! Look how the wind blows! After a while it takes away the words that I said. The wind doesn't take away the good words you've said, son, it just takes away the bad. No more cheating! From now on, we'll go to the villages bearing our own names. Emiliano Reyes will be racing by the rules! ? Walking through the park I saw a gentle girl. ? Slowly we walked together, then I declared my love for her. ? But she said no, no, no, she could not love me. ? "Love me a little, lady of my life, come, give me your love." ? But how nice it is to dance the waltz, so close together the two of us,... ? Moving your feet, lifting your feet,... ? don't be shy about drinking, because here comes Paco saying "Cheers"! ? Toast with chicha this young lady worth all the gold in Peru. ? But how nice it is to dance the waltz, so close together the two of us,... ? Moving your feet, lifting feet,... ? don't be shy about drinking, because here comes Paco saying "Cheers"! ? Toast with chicha this young lady worth all the gold in Peru. ? Walking through the park I saw a gentle girl. ? Slowly we walked together, then I declared my love for her. ? But she said no, no, no, she could not love me. ? "Love me a little, lady of my life, come, give me your love." ? But how nice it is to dance so waltz! ? Toast with chicha on this young lady worth all the gold in Peru. ? Hey, lady, what, don't you have money enough to buy sweet rolls? What did you say, boy? I mean you give way to me once and for all. I have to say one thing to Little Jesus and you keep hogging the best spot. "Little Jesus?" Let's hear you talk with more respect for Our Lord. But I address him this way out of endearment! Come on, leave me alone and go somewhere else to pray. No, I have to yell to Him, and right in front, so He can hear me well. But you...just shove off! Christ! I came to tell You that we'll be racing fairly. Please help my dad win so he doesn't need to go back to cheating again. Don't You forget, but I have to hurry off before the race starts. Thanks, see you later. Run, Dad, hurry, you're going to win! Run, Dad, hurry, so they don't beat you, Dad, run! Hurray, Dad! We won! We won! ~ Did you like that, buddy? ~ Yes, Dad! ~ That's my dad! ~ The prize. Thank you! Congratulations. Well done. Fifty thousand sols. A tidy sum! I'm at your command. Well, the sooner the better. We mustn't lose sight of him, Manuel. The Mexican won fairly. And you're not from around here. No, sir, we 're not locals. Congratulations, congratulations. Well? Decide, then. Which do you like? The black boots. And for your mom, hmm? Go for the red ones. We'll buy the black boots and three pairs of red. Three matched pairs? Ah, how's that your...! The same, but different. If I remember right, your mom Teresa has the biggest hooves. And your mom Josefa's are smaller. And my mom Candelaria has the smallest. So give me one of each size. And those three gift-wrapped, with a bow that big! Mama Josefa! Well, you finally remembered that I exist! Where's your father? He couldn't come, but he sent you this gift. Then tell him not to send me gifts but to come see me,... and ask him if it seems fair to him to leave this poor woman here on her own doing nothing but... Yes, Mama Josefa, I'll tell him, and make sure he comes to see you soon. Eh! Already you're leaving? Wait, I want to ask you some things. I still have lots of places to go. Bye, Mama Josefa! Hey! Oh, you've grown! Wow! How long since we've seen each other? You're ungrateful, you already forgot about me. No, Mama Candelaria, it's just that we couldn't come. Sure, wandering to and fro like always. Your father should settle down --- don't you think? --- and make a home. We like to live like that. It's great! No, son, that life isn't good. But sit down, I'll give you a drink until your dad arrives. It's just...my dad's not coming. He had a problem. But he sent me to bring you this gift. So he won't be coming? Then tell your father that my patience has its limit,... and that when he wants to give me something, he should bring it to me himself. Take your gift along. Well, I'll leave it here. I don't want anything! Mother Teresa! Son, but what a miracle! Be advised that I've come alone. My dad's very busy. Sorry, I would have liked to see him,... but I'm glad you came. Will you stay with me a few days, right? I can't, Mother Teresa. I just came to bring this gift my dad sent you. Thank him for me. Aren't you mad at him? ~ Mmm...Maybe, but don't tell him. All right? ~ Nope!! ? Death comes wearing... ? a thousand striking colors. ? Here, give me a kiss, miserly one,... ? since I'm missing love. ? The world's a sand pebble, the sun just another spark,... ? And here I am sharing a drink with Death, and He's the one who treats. ? I do not fear Death,... ? I fear life more! ? How difficult to die... ? when coping with a wounded soul! ? They say you're going to scare me by taking me to Your presence. ? If you're just asleep in my life it's only natural that you wake up. ? I do not fear death,... ? I fear life more! ? How difficult to die... ? when coping with a wounded soul! ? I'll get more firewood. I'll be right back. And now why are you laughing? Damn! What the fuck!? Well, the shopkeeper screwed up the wrapping! So now, which of your moms walks with black boots, huh? Even Lucero is laughing! No, he's not laughing. Put the money in the guitar and head for the hills. Go on. What's wrong with you, Dad? What's wrong with you, Dad? Talk to me! Get the picture? The game of life --- I tell you --- is rigged, my son. Talk to me, Dad! What's wrong? Hey! Hey, tired one! Sir! My father is hurt. Help me to take him to get healed, please! ~ What's the nearest town? ~ San Jos?. ~ Is there a doctor there? ~ Yes, there is. Where's your father? ~ There. ~ Let's go get him. Wake up, we're here. You don't want to wake up and your face is very swollen. I'll go for the priest, he'll help. Never mind the priest, fetch a doctor! I'm a doctor. Let him go! Doctor, help me heal my dad! What is this scandal? Disarm him! If you come any closer I'll fill you with lead! I'm the sheriff. Put that gun down if you do not want... I won't put down nothing, and if you come closer I'll gun you down! Shoot him, shoot him, sheriff! Stop this, stop this! Silence! Silence! Quiet, you go back to your church! What do you want, to kill that child? Very well. Is that what you really want, cowards? Shall we see who'll be first? But don't you see, Father, don't you see he's willing to kill anyone who comes close? Then he'll have to kill me. Shoot me if you want, but I mean to help your father. My dad needs a doctor! No, he needs me. Please don't keep praying so long. Don't you see that he's bleeding? ~ My son...your father is dead! ~ That's not true! The doctor can cure him. Sorry, lad. I can't cure him. Your dad's been dead for several hours. Not true, he's unconscious because of his bleeding,... but you can cure him! Well, do you want to place the first clod? I don't want to throw any dirt! What I want is to talk to him. Well, tell him what you please. You were right, Dad, the game of life is rigged. But as soon as I hunt down those bastards I'll shoot them down! You, why do you stick your nose in? ~ You're right, son. ~ I'm talking to him. Forgive me, but I thought he would like to... be sent on his way with a smile, a kind word... not with you looking so angry. You're very right. Good bye, Dad, I love you! But I'll kill those who killed you! Go ahead. ~ You? ~ Can I come in? Yeah. What do you want? I came to congratulate you, Doctor. "Doctor"! I don't like jokes. It's not a joke. You are a doctor first and foremost, and it showed today. It was stupid. Your faithful, your pious savages, nearly lynched me. And yet you didn't mislead that poor child. And what do I care about children? I don't care about anything. All I want is to live, and not be persecuted. The Son of God was persecuted. Bah, save your sermons! I don't believe in God, nor in the son of God, nor in you, nor anyone else. That's not the problem. The difficulty is that you don't believe in yourself. But I DO believe in you, Doctor. Father, if you want I'll take him to my house and look after him. No, for now he has to stay with me. You heard what he said in the cemetery. I have to watch over him.. Poor you, Father, with the hard work you have in this parish! I think it would be better to look for his mother, and... I have no mother, I have moms! Go to that room and wait there for a minute. And you've done me fuck-all good, right? I was the idiot who asked you to take care of him, and look what happened! You certainly didn't lift a finger. So let's get this straight: I don't know you and you don't know me. I'm sorry I interrupted your prayer. You're right, son, to ask Christ to welcome your father into heaven. Christ? Who's that? Who else could it be? Jesus, Our Lord! No, I never I heard of him. Well, don't worry, it's not your fault. I'll see that you're introduced to him. Will you now tell me your name? Fucking hell! Well, my name is Esteban, Rogaciano, Crescencio,... and lots of others I can't call to mind just now. Good! And what did your father work at? Well...as far as "work"... Look, my dad was like three in the morning:... "We're almost to four." Now do you understand? And tell me something: you were never in a catechism class nor talked to another priest? For the truth, my dad was pretty unfond of men in petticoats. And so am I. So you dislike me? Not quite yet. But I wear petticoats... But when the shooting starts, your trousers show up. You're Mexican, right? Give me a break, what a question! Doesn't it clearly show? I'm from Mexico. ~ Really? ~ Yes, really. I'll take my time to dig into your soul, and we'll see if it's true. And...do you really have no family, or anyone? No, we were alone. And we lived on the horse,... running, singing, and sleeping where we felt good. And now, what do you plan to do? Well...what do you mean, "what"? Find and kill the bandits. And you wouldn't you want to stay here with me? And why should I? Because I want to be your friend. You risked your life to defend me, I don't deny it. What if I stay and get endeared to you, and then you betray me? Don't worry, my son. Your father was certainly a good man,... but was unlucky not to find anyone to show him that the game of life isn't necessarily rigged. I'll prove it to you, and he'll see that from up there. He's really watching me? Can he hear what I'm saying? Yes, indeed! Then excuse me for a moment, because I want to tell him one thing. Talk to him all you want. I'll warm up dinner. You must be hungry. Hey, Dad, it must seem odd for me to be staying here with the petticoats,... but so far he's behaved like a brave man. Don't you think? Every time I leave you keep an eye on things. Remember that the money's in there, that you earned in good faith. I already told my dad that I'll be staying with you. I'm very pleased. This is your house and I'm your guy. Right, put'er there! It seems to me that you're a true Mexican. Now sit down and dig in. Rice pudding and chocolate. There's nothing more. Here we go. I addressed you familiarly because that's how it is between friends. And don't think I'm going to call you "Father"... and slobber on your hand like those old cows. What's your name? My name's Jos? Mar?a. Well, I'll call you Chema. Well, call me what you want. Holy crap --- damn Virgin Mary! Let your tongue fart dirty words, Chema, so your tongue cools down! Good morning, son. Well rested? I did, but you have to be sore. Why did you sleep on the bricks? Because I like it. It's healthy. Are you already starting to trick me, Chema? Last night when you left you told me to sleep here. I thought you had another bed. Today I will. Don't worry. Well, I'll prepare everything for bathing. Can I help you, Chema? No. I'll tell you later what your obligations are. Sleep a little longer, or say the morning prayers...whatever. Say my prayers? Yeah, dream on! I'd be a fool to pray to you again! Better I sleep a little longer. Oh, oh, no! No, no, no, please don't kill me! No, no! No, no! Don't kill me, I'm Fulgencio, the sacrist?n, the sacrist?n, the sacrist?n! You're a thief, so for you to get cured of it, take this! I'm dying! I'm hurt! I'm dying! ~ Shut up, stop, stop. ~ He almost killed me, Father, he almost killed me! I want you to know once and for all:... this room, the sacristy, the courtyard, all are part of God's house, and must be respected. So should I let this guy steal my guitar...? I repeat: this is the house of God, and here we do not say bad words or shoot guns. OK, Chema, I won't do it again, but just because you ask me,... since God is no one to me. You'll get to know Him in due time. And you leave that guitar alone. Do you hear me? ~ If you ever touch it again I'll flatten you with lead! ~ Didn't I tell you...? Well, let me finish, Chema! I'll gun you down...out there! No more threats. Give me that gun. No way, Chema. A man must always go about well-armed. ~ Ah, I thought it was the other way around! ~ What do you mean? I thought a real man knows how to defend himself, without needing a gun. No, Chema, you're wrong. You know nothing of this. Well, maybe, but when a man has guts he doesn't need to wander around scaring people with his gun. Not to scare people, it's to defend yourself in time! You know more about that, but I think with a gun in his hand, even a coward can be brave. Anyway...if you need a gun to feel like a real man, then keep it. Maybe...I was wrong, I thought you were a real man. I'm a man, gun or no gun. Here. You keep it so you'll see that what I say is true. Now I believe you. And don't forget: guns are for cowards. The brave don't need them. And let's go, it's late for mass. The bathroom's back here. Bathe, eat breakfast, and go to church. Bugger the church! I told you I don't know God. How could you want me to visit his home? You won't see God, you're going to see me. I'll wait for you there. Now calm down, Fulgencio, nothing happened. Nothing happened, but what if it does happen? That child doesn't know God, and won't pray --- he's like a wild animal,... he just lost his father and all his memories are bound up in that worthless guitar. It's all there. Did you notice, Dad? If I hadn't been on my toes, that damned sacrist?n would have grabbed it all. Take care of it while I go to church to see the petticoats. Chema --- do you like him, Dad? Me, honestly, I like him a lot. He's not a fraud. And what do you think about what he said about the gun? Don't you think that's right? "Who is this?" And people responded: "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus went into the temple and cast out all them that sold and bought there,... and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the chairs of those who sold doves,... saying to them, "It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer..." I'm here, Chema, so don't grouse. ~ Uncover yourself. ~ What should I do? ~ Take off your hat. ~ What if it gets stolen? In today's Gospel --- without doubt --- is a lesson for us all, my dear brothers. You may be seated. Seeing the merchants in the temple, Our Lord used violence,... and chased them out by beating them. Do you understand? If He was all love and goodness, why did He do such a thing? ~ Because he was angry. And he laid into them! ~ Silence. ~ Well, you asked, Chema! ~ You are in God's house. I didn't want to come. Keep on with your argument. I'll wait outside for you. Yes, my friends, as we were saying, Our Lord Jesus Christ was very right... to chase away merchants in the temple in the way He did. Well, let's go over them again. The first: Love God above all things. Second: Do not swear in the name of God in vain. The third: sanctify the holidays. The fourth: Honor your father and mother. Fifth: Do not kill. The sixth:... ~ The seventh:... ~ The sixth: Don't sneeze. What did you say? Well, I thought! Because every time you get to the sixth you catch cold... The sixth commandment I'll explain later. Let's go on now. Why, Chema, if I already know all the catechism? I can repeat it as well as any parrot. That's precisely what we don't want, that you repeat it like a parrot,... but rather that you understand everything you're saying. You've picked yourself a tough row to hoe, there. You confront me with God and the church, pure God and God all day long. Quite right, since God is everywhere. He is the Creator of everything that exists. Dare you mean he made everything? Absolutely everything. Did he also create the thieves who killed my father? Them, too. He created them good and innocent, it's just that they chose the wrong path. You say that God loves us, right? Yes, son, He loves us very much. That's a load of cobblers, Chema. If he loved us both, why didn't he lift a finger to help my dad? Come on, answer me! Because He arranged something better, which only He knows. Fine, but...well, I can't imagine what. That's why I have so much anger toward him. Fuck, I hooked one! Oh, shut up! You've frightened it with your screams. Sit down and stay very, very still. This is a very delicate matter. ~ Hey, I want to ask you something. ~ What? Many times I've wanted to call you by name, but since you have so many I can't remember any. You learned the catechism,... and even though you don't believe, I'm minded that you're ready to become religious. Let me baptize you, son. Well, baptize me, Chema, but just because you've been so good to me. Thanks, you give me great joy. What name do you want? Well, if you don't get angry and the name fits us both,... I'd like to be called Jos? Mar?a, just like you. What do you think? Great! See, now I'll show you how to cast the line. Watch. Jos? Mar?a, if you're not baptized, I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Fuck, Chema, it's super-duper freezing! Now, Jos? Mar?a, now you are a Christian. May God guide you! ~ My Godson! ~ Thank you! Mar?a, give our gift to our godson. So that Our Lord will watch over you always. Chema, I'm such a schmuck! I just noticed: how could he have defended my dad? How could he put raise hands to help,... if He has them nailed to the cross? ~ Give it a whack! ~ Hit it, hit it! And you, why are you staring at me so much? What, do I have monkeys on my face? May it be that you got so angry about so little? It's you who's angry. No, it's this party --- the real truth is I find it totally boring. This is a Mexican party your godparents put on for your baptism. I don't like pi?atas. I like horses. And guns. Yes, I remember. Was that gun yours? Of course! Would you like me to show it to you? ~ Let's see. ~ Right now I don't have it with me. But if you want, I'll bring it to your house this evening. ~ You don't know where I live! ~ Well, tell me! Or I'll find out. I'm not kidding. I'll whistle like a muleteer and you come running. ~ Let's see, now it's up to another child. ~ Let's see, Father, let me. ~ Now it's your turn. ~ Ah, Jos? Mar?a! Make him blindfold you, Jos? Mar?a. I'll swathe them carefully for you. I'll cover them because you're not supposed to see. Let's see, tell me what I'm holding up --- a cross or some horns? Cross! There, he can't see anything! Don't cheat. Smash it, and soon it'll break. There it is, there it is, there it is. Now, now! Higher, Jos? Mar?a! Higher! Stronger, pound it! ~ Did you bring it? ~ Yes, come check it out. Hurry, because if my dad finds out, I'll get scolded. My father never scolded me. But mine isn't my real dad. He beats me up when he gets mad. If you want I'll let you keep it, and when he's about to beat you, you put two slugs in him. No! What are you thinking? It's silver, right? I know: so he won't beat you, come live with me and Chema. Don't address the father that way. Don't be disrespectful. He likes me to address him this way. We're friends. So, would you come live with us? Are you crazy? How can I leave my mother and my kid brothers? Well, I don't like you getting hit. I feel really bad about it. Why? I don't know. What's your name? ~ Edelmira Romero. ~ Edelmira? Your name is nice. And you're pretty. So, then, would you come live with us? No, Jos? Mar?a! What are you thinking? What are you laughing at? You're the first girl who called me Jos? Mar?a. And you, what are you doing with that gun? Just in case, maybe I'll run into one of those who hits girls... and accidently shoot him. I don't think anyone's able to hit a girl. And you don't go playing around with a with that gun --- that's dangerous. Aren't you Edelmira's father? I don't even know her! I'm not from here. And I didn't know that in this town children pack guns. Where do you live? Who are you the son of? I...am the son...of the priest! Go to sleep now, it's late. ~ Hey, Chema. ~ What? I wanted to say that today I did a really bad thing. What did you do, Jos? Mar?a? Well, I got the gun for a while, but only to brag about, right? Well, son, you can't change your whole way of life at the drop of a hat. But don't do it again. All right? No, Chema. My word. ~ Hey, Chema. ~ What? Is it wrong for a man to marry? No, on the contrary. Marriage is one of the sacraments of Holy Mother Church. Well, that's great, because I want to marry a girl and bring her to live with us! Say what?! Are you crazy? Get back to praying and talk no more nonsense. Shit, no one can understand priests! When you grow up, we'll talk about that. First you have to study and prepare yourself for life. Bah! It's almost complete. Look how beautiful it is! The whole village worked to paint it and fix it up. Fine, but I'm too big, Chema. The only ones coming are those little squirts. Here's where those come who want to learn. Do you want be ignorant all your life? No, but you can teach me all the letters. No, the teacher will teach you better than I could. Come on, come on, the kids won't arrive much later. Good morning, Teacher. Good morning, Father. I was expecting you. Here's what I brought you. Well, Jos? Mar?a, how are you? Totally pissed off! Come on, tell him why. Talk frankly. I don't want to be mixed up with these cute little kids. ~ Good morning, Father. ~ Good morning, Father. ~ Good morning. ~ Good morning, teacher. You see, Chema? They are pure dwarves. Better let's go. That does not matter, Jos? Mar?a. Any age is good for learning. ~ Good morning, Father. ~ Good morning. Good morning, Lolita. Come on, Chema. I'd rather remain ignorant. Understand that this is for your sake, Jos? Mar?a. When you learn to read and write, you'll be very glad of having put in this effort. OK, Chema. Well, I'll stay, then. What do you think? ~ Good morning. ~ Good morning. ~ Did you see how far they went? ~ Yes, very far. Now I'm going to bring you a wildflower. No, because I have to go. Don't go yet! I really like being with you. I also like being with you, but I have to go. And --- you know, Jos? Mar?a? --- don't make signs and blink at me all the time... because the other children in the class are saying things. ~ What things? ~ That we're engaged. They're pure gossips! We're not dating, we're rightfully married, but we just didn't have a religious ceremony as yet. Are we really a couple? Yes, when we get married you'll come to live with me and Chema,... so your dad won't hit you anymore. He doesn't hit me now. He's left. Well, we're a couple now, anyway, just in case he comes back and attacks you again. Don't tell anyone that we're a couple. ~ Not even Chema? ~ No! What do you think? ~ Well, OK, nobody. ~ Now let's go. Hey, when my dad was saying goodbye to my moms, he gave them a kiss. Will you let me give you a kiss? But just one, because it's too late. Good. Now you. I'm here, Chema. People are arriving for the Novena! It's filling the church. Where's my godfather? I sent him to Do?a Hermelinda with medicine. She's very ill, the poor dear. Now it's your turn to collect alms. Go on, put this on. Ah, no, Chema! And what is it? I won't wear this costume. ~ Ah! ~ Don't get mad, Chema! Let me collect alms my own way and I bet I get more then I would in those petticoats like yours. Right? Do what you want. We pray from the depths of Your heart for this Your joy and Your pain... may You please present Your sufferings before God... so that we never lose Jesus through mortal sin. And if unfortunately we lose Him... let us seek Him again with the deepest sorrow... and until we find Him, benign, especially at the time of death,... then to enjoy Him in heaven... and bless with You His holy mercy for eternity, amen. Let us pray. O God, in Your ineffable providence You have deigned to choose San Jos? as the husband of the Blessed Mother... and beg You to act as we venerate You as the Savior of the world... Into the kitty! Thank you, brother! ...In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Holy Mother. You may go in peace. What was all that, Jos? Mar?a? Didn't you promise me you wouldn't use that again? But it wasn't for a fight, Chema. Look just. When have we harvested so much? Really, it's the only thing these people understand. Don't you think? But do you realize, threatening the faithful with a gun inside the temple...? Well, Jesus just used a whip! Ah...! For merchants, the Pharisees. So? I do it to these bastards who turn a blind eye so as not to give alms. My son, I finally found you! I've searched by sea and land! It was an agony! But thank God I found you, and I'll never part with you! Did you miss me, son? Yes, mama Josefa! I've done nothing but think about you. Me, too, Mama Josefa! Excuse me, ma'am, I think you'll want to talk privately. Come along, my son, come to the square so we can talk at our ease. I'm back, Father. Yes, Fulgencio. How is Mrs. Hermelinda? Too bad...I think she'll pass on tonight. God, don't say that! I'll go see her in a little while. Hey, Father: who is this lady who is talking with Jos? Mar?a there in the park? One of his many moms. No wonder she was hugging him so hard! And Jos? Mar?a, how did he seem to you? Was he happy? Well, who knows, because when I tried to approach, he signed for me to leave. I hope she doesn't win him over. I know she doesn't deserve this youngster. I see that you love him very much. Isn't that right, Father? Yes, Fulgencio, a lot. He's a sarky brat but with a noble and generous heart. You even get excited when you talk about him! Well, don't let this woman take him away. No, Fulgencio, a priest should get attached to anything or anyone. God's will be done. But go to fix up the altar for San Jos?. Look, son, ever since your daddy was killed, I haven't shed mourning. I loved him very much, and had no hard feelings. And here I am, poor and sick, but resigned. Are you ill, Mother Josefa? Yes, my son, very sick! And I can't afford to buy the medicine. But I don't mind the money. You know that. He earned it, he spent it. That's how he lived. What if he was killed before he had a chance to spend it? Scoundrels! And tell me, son, did they take the money? Did they take...! My dad was no fool! So you have it? Sure! And it's well hidden in a place that nobody knows. But that's very dangerous! Suppose someone finds it and takes it. Well as Chema says: "It would be God's will." But how could it be God's will? Look, son: to me that money does not matter, but I'm afraid you're going to be left with nothing. I have always loved you. Why not get that money, you come to live with me, and I'll keep it? Well, let me think. What's to think about! I'll do it for your sake. Look, go get it and we'll leave. All right? But right now I can't get to it. ~ Look, maybe you can meet me at ten... ~ Where? Santa Rosa, forgive my taking your alms, but I'm in dire need of money. Do you forgive me? Thanks, Santa Rosa! Ah, you crook, I've caught you now! No, no, no, Godson, don't think anything bad! This money I take from Santa Rosa... to bring to the fund of San Francisco because the poor thing is very stretched lately. Good thinking, Godfather! Let's take it there. ~ Maybe in a while. ~ Come on, move! ~ Wait, Godson, I'm coming! ~ Come on, hurry, run, Godfather, hurry. ~ No more rushing! ~ Oh, don't hold back. ~ Well, don't drag me, son! ~ Run, Godfather! ~ I'm coming, I'm coming! ~ Move! ~ Enough, enough is enough. ~ Come on, hurry up. ~ Put it in. ~ It doesn't fit! Don't say that! OK, it fits. You're not going to tell the father, right? I'm not a gossip. And if you think I came to spy, you're wrong, because I came to ask a favor. Whatever you want, Godson, whatever you want. Look, I have to get something from my room, and I want you to distract Chema with some sort of hassle. The father has just left and will be back late because he went to see Do?a Hermelinda. The poor dear is very ill. How nice!...Well, not really! But I don't want Chema to meet me. What are you up to, Jos? Mar?a? I'll do whatever I have to do, and you're going to help me. ~ Come on! ~ Insert it! ~ I hid it here. ~ In the graveyard? ~ Yes, in a tomb. ~ In your dad's? No! What do you think? But child...! Don't you know that's a great sin? I didn't know, Mama Josefa. Really. So we'd better leave it for another time? No...look...we'll remove it at once. Don't be afraid. We're almost there already. ~ Best if we went back, right? ~ No, we'll remove it at once. ~ Oh! But what was that? ~ Nothing. Woman of Satan, you're doomed! Mommy, mommy! Now what's wrong with you, man? Now how can I put it back on the bed? Look how fucked up it got! Oh, I hurt in all my very bones! Oh, damn! A thousand times damn, Godfather, don't talk like that! You're in God's house. Okay, don't get mad. Now tell me why did you play that trick on Josefa, your mom? So she won't come back and keep bothering me. The father thought you were going to go with her. It's what she wanted, but I wouldn't leave Chema even if she dragged me. No way! After all, I love him almost as if he were my dad. Well said, well spoken! And to celebrate, we're going to take a sip of consecrated wine. Now I give you permission, Godfather. To your health. I'd like a little, too, Fulgencio. But you almost finished it off! ~ A finger's worth, Father! ~ A finger? So! Well, now let's have the reading lesson. Jos? Mar?a. What do you have there? A giant cricket, master. It's not the time to play with crickets. Come here with your book. Page fifteen. Bees give us honey. Sheep give us wool. Cows give us milk. But they don't give us anything, Teacher, we take it from them by force! Go on, keep reading. You were doing very well. The Earth gives us its bounty. Jos? Mar?a? Jos? Mar?a! It was Lucero, I swear it was him! ~ Run to find the father. ~ Yes. Jos? Mar?a! Wait! Chase him, Don Severo, I'm sure it was him! Hang on, hang on, what's all this? Who do you want me to chase? Can you tell what kind of mess is this? I don't know, I guess he's talking about his horse. He'll get away! I recognized Lucero's whinny! There are lots of horses here and you hear lots of whinnies. I can't run after each animal, you understand. Then lend me a horse and a gun, and you can stay sitting here! Excuse me, make way. Let me through. Jos? Mar?a! He was the one who killed my father and stole Lucero, Chema, and nobody wants to believe me! Calm down, son, calm down. Why the hell should I calm down?! It's your fault for having taken away my gun! Otherwise the bastard would already be shot down! Are you angry? No, not angry, but I'm sad, Jos? Mar?a. Is it my fault, Chema? Yes, because of you. You forgot all my teaching. You no longer remember even the Ten Commandments. That's not true, I can tell them on the run. What is the fifth commandment? ~ Fifth: Don't kill. ~ Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not kill! Listen, Jos? Mar?a, and do not forget what I tell you. If someday you take away the life of a man, you'll be taking MY life away. Yours, really? Yes, my son, because that would mean I'm a bad priest,... who didn't turn your mind away from revenge nor did I plant in your heart the attitude of forgiveness. Guys, the blasphemer is back in town! Don't hit me! Don't be cowards, now you'll have to face me! Terrorists, leave him alone, terrorists! Everyone gather into the church! Absolutely everyone! Into the church, right now! Come with me. You won't mind entering the church for a moment? Thank you. Jos? Mar?a, help me. Please. Is this a Christian town? You call yourselves Christians, but you're responsible for shedding the blood of a human being,... of a fellow, a brother. Yes, a brother, even if he doesn't share our beliefs. I wonder if there is anyone here who thinks he's better than this man who has not harmed a soul. No one, absolutely no one, not even myself. And I want you to know one thing:... from now on anyone who dares to insult this man will have to deal with me. And I tell him that this church is his home,... I am his friend,... and my hand in God's name will always be ready to protect him. And mine, too! My Lord Jesus Christ, true God and man,... for being who You are, and because I love you above all things,... I am sorry, Lord, to have offended... and firmly intend, with your help, to offend You no more,... to confess, to fulfill the penance I've imposed,... to turn myself away from all occasions of sin. I offer my life, works, and in satisfaction of all my sins... I hope for your infinite goodness and mercy... forgive me, give me the grace to make amends,... and persevere in Your holy service to the end of my life. Amen. Come, Francisco. We'll meet them on the way. ~ Yes, Father. ~ I'm going with you, Chema? ~ No, sir, you leave for school! ~ What about me, Father? You, Fulgencio, attend the sacristy and nothing else. Go calmly, Father, and hopefully you can raise the money. Oh, enough, enough! I know what he told you: he's bored with me. Did you notice how he spoke to me? The Father walks in a hurry because the church is still falling to pieces... and he needs money to fix it. No, Godfather, don't you see he doesn't love me anymore? He just ran off and didn't even say goodbye. Don't mind that, and head off to school because you're running late. I don't want to go to school. I'd better go to the river because I want to talk to myself. Fine. Forgive me, God, I don't know what I'm doing. What a drink! Never mind...I buy a horse, I'm out, and I leave him. Son! How happy I found you! How did you know I was here? I asked the sacrist?n. He didn't want to tell me, but I explained that it was very urgent. Sit down, Mama Candelaria. What's wrong? Nothing, son. You think it was easy? Since your father died, I've gone crazy looking for you,... thinking that you were wandering on your own in the world of God. ~ I live with Chema. ~ Who's Chema? The Father. I live with him in the church annex. You don't have to live mooching off him, son. You know I love you like your mother,... and my home, even though it's very poor, it's also your home. Thanks, Mama Candelaria. Right now we're going to see the father and you can go with me. He's not in the village. Then we can leave message with the sacrist?n. So, are you going with me? Well, yes. I think Chema no longer loves me like before. See? As the saying goes: the dead and the guest stink after three days. Yes, that's true. Let's go, then. Oh! Are you going with me? But how happy you make me, baby! Now go get your stuff and we'll go. Hey, speaking of something else... You have to have kept all that your dad left, right? The guitar and the gun. The horse was stolen by the same... Don't tell me...everything that he won the race was taken? No, I have the money and it's well hidden. Blessed be God, son! How happy you make me! That money is your future, and I've thought a good investment for it. That is, if you trust me and want this to be done. Of course, Mother Candelaria. Now let's go get it and we'll leave tonight. Yes, my son, yes. Where should I pick you up? Well...what could be a good place? We'll walk a while, while I think. Whatever you want, darling. Let's finish waking you up! I'm drowning! I simply can't leave you on your own even if for a little while! I bet you already forgot what you have to do! I remember very well, so I took my shots, to give me courage. Well, come on, it's nearly time. But, Godson, why would you want me to commit this great sin? More of a sin is steal the alms get drunk on the wine aimed to be consecrated! Neither holds a candle to that, because what we're doing is very bad. Well, either way, you're all set. I'll wait for her in the church at ten o'clock. Okay, let's see how it goes. See you there. ~ Right, then. ~ Oh, God! I arrived just on time. It's ten o'clock. Have you already packed up your stuff? It's in my room. I'll get it while you grab the money bag, and then we'll go. ~ Where do I get it? ~ San Benito has it. ~ San Benito? Shhh! The image is there, in the sacristy, on a dresser. I put it under the habit, well knotted in a handkerchief. I won't be long. You see to taking money. Forgive me, San Benito. Women of Satan, you're doomed. Candelaria Mom! What's wrong? ~ What is it? ~ Get down, Godfather, she died. Alas, San Benito, San Benito! What do we do now? Did you see, kid? She fainted from fright. ~ Should I get the doctor? ~ Are you crazy? So he can see me dressed like this? ~ And what if she dies? ~ No way she'll die, you'll see how she runs off! Bring that bottle of alcohol over there. ~ Here it is. ~ No, not wine, alcohol. I'm blind! I can't see! It's God's punishment! I don't want anything, I want nothing! What doesn't she want? She thought my dad had left money behind. I said he didn't but she was stubborn! With all that, she'll never come back over here. Well, I will take a drink to your health but don't tell anyone, OK? Now I'll give you permission. Godson, to your health. Alcohol! I came to ask You to excuse me on the San Benito mess,... but You see, my mama Candelaria just wanted the money,... like my mama Josefa. They don't love me at all. And the worst is that even Chema no longer loves me! Did You notice how he talked to me? No way. Just now that I was getting endeared to him and You,... Now is when I have to leave. Well, not You, because You're everywhere. But Chema...now, tell me what wrong did I do to him? He's already fed up with me! So be warned right now that I'm going tonight. I commend Chema to You, take care of him. Don't let anything bad happen to him, even if he doesn't love me anymore. I'm going to go, Dad. I've thought, and it's for the best. You've been warned. Why aren't you asleep? It's late. Well...I haven't slept because...because...I won't live with you anymore, Chema. What did you say? You heard me. Look, I eat a lot of food,... and then you go on there...buying underwear, buying shoes... No, Chema, I've realized that I'm a burden to you, and I'd better go. Don't ever say that, son of my soul, you're what I love the most in the world,... and every day I thank God for having sent you to me! So, do you love me like before? Much more! I do not know what I would do without you! Why do you ask? It's that this morning you spoke to me very harshly,... and you left without even saying goodbye. Forgive me, Jos? Mar?a, I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't want to talk about this, but...I have so many economic problems! Forgive me, my son. Well, you won't have any, Chema,... but I first wanted to see if you still loved me as before. Fifty thousand sols. Where did you get this money, Jos? Mar?a? Right there, Chema, don't think wrong! Dad won it fairly in his last race,... and since you have been good to me... my dad and I will donate this for the church repairs. It's a miracle! The miracle was to win the race without cheating or anything! Forgive me, Papa, my big mouth! Take it back. I thank you with all my heart, but I can't accept. But my dad and I really want to give it to you...! Why do you despise our gift? It's not despising it, but I can't deprive you of this money. It's your heritage...for your education. You understand? All right. Then I'll give it to Him, since He's also been very good to me. If God and your dad command so...then it was meant to be used to fix up the church. God bless you, my son! Juan! Give me a hand, all right? Come on, man! Go on, hold it steady! Well, now, don't leave me alone, man! What "Don't leave me alone"? With your permission, Father. Can we talk for a minute? Yes, come, it would be a pleasure. Come. Have a seat. You were saying? Father, we know you picked up a child and baptized him with the name of Jos? Mar?a. Who are you? I am Vicente Garcia, at your service, and she is Teresa, my wife. According to both the Church and the State. Here I bring the papers to show it's true. No doubt, but what has that to do with Jos? Mar?a? I'll explain. She was dating Emiliano Reyes, the father of the child. Before our marriage, she explained everything to me and I accepted her. And I do not regret it, because she's a good wife. Father, I love your child a lot. Emiliano came to Peru some years ago with a company of Mexican cowboys who roamed through the villages. That's how I met him. His wife had recently died and the child was very small. Emiliano could not console himself and walked around like a crazy man. I felt pity for him and the baby, and I asked him to let me take care of the child. How long did the child live with you? Two years. He often came to see his son, but what had happened, happened. When the child was four he took him,... and I was heartbroken because I loved him like my own. Did you know that Jos? Mar?a doesn't have the money left to him by his father anymore? What money, Father? We do not know anything about any money, nor do we care. I have a good farm, called El Refugio, thirty kilometers from Lima. You can have me checked out. Everyone around there knows me. Well, now, father, we want to legally adopt the child,... give him a Christian home, an education, and raise him to be a real man. I also intend to make him a man, and I love him like a son. For a priest, all children are your children, but for us he would be the only one. What if later on you have children of your own? What will become of Jos? Mar?a? We won't have any, Father. You love him a lot, right? With all my heart, and that's why I must care for his happiness and his future, not my feelings. Wait here. I'll go get the boy. No, Father. It's not fair. Let's do it later, when the child has grown and you don't need him so much. My wife is right. We would be left with remorse,... and it's certain you would guide him better than we could. Thank you. I thank you wholeheartedly. Father, I ask a favor. Let me leave you some money to help in the child's expenses. I can see that you are poor, and... No, please. I need nothing. Otherwise I'd accept, believe me. But I want you to know one thing: that if one day I have to part with the child... I'll leave him with you and no one else. Those words honor us, Father. These words may be realized soon. Very soon? Yes, my daughter. Franciscan Missionaries are changed every three years,... with few exceptions. I already fulfilled my mission in this town,... and no doubt I'm soon to be transferred to somewhere where I might not be able to take the boy. It depends on the site where I'm assigned. Just now I'm awaiting orders from my superiors. It would hurt you very much to leave him. Very much indeed, but now I feel more comfortable knowing you'll care for him. Like our own child, I assure you. Thank you, God bless you! Goodbye. ~ Goodbye, Father. ~ Good-bye, my dear. Thy will be done. Chema! Chema! I just saw my mama Teresa! Yes, son, she was here talking to me. Fuck, she must want the money! Like the other two that I told you about... Repent of that thought, Jos? Mar?a. I also had that thought, and I offended her. I will do penance for it. Your mama Teresa is a wonderful woman, full of tenderness and pity. May God bless her! ? These are the birthday songs by King David... ? Father, Jos? Mar?a, we're singing here. ? Wake up, Father, wake up, the day's already dawned,... ? the birds are already singing, the moon has gone away. ? Wake up, Father, wake up, the day's already dawned,... ? the birds are already singing, the moon has gone away. ? How beautiful is the morning when I come to greet you! ? Why, Lord, why? ? How nice it is all together, and we want to congratulate you! ? It's dawn, and there's the light God has given us. ? Get up this morning, see it has already dawned. ? ~ Happy Birthday! ~ Thank you, thank you! Congratulations, Chema! Hurray for Chema! It doesn't look like your Lucero, but it's not bad, right? He's really nice, Chema, he's great! What are you going to call it? Why not call it Jos? Mar?a, like you and me? How crass! How could you think of naming a horse after the Father? It's a little weird, right? Yes, that's true, Chema. Forgive me. So, I know: I'm going to call it "The Gift". Great idea. Do you hear? He liked the name. And now I have another nice gift. Other? What is it? You'll see. Come over here. Come, come. That's it. Here, sit, sit. Sit and listen. ? You passed through my life like a gentle breeze. ? And you came to me like a sweet song. ? You gave me joy with your cheerful laughter. ? And on the wings of a dream you took me to a dream world. ? I know you will leave some day, when I least expect it. ? like the breeze passing by, like a song finally ending. ? I know you'll leave one day because everything dies in the end, because everything has its end,... ? and there's no turning back. ? I know it will be useless to try to stop you. ? Who stops the hours that come and go? ? I know you will go one day, I know I shall miss you,... ? Because you're a dream, a breath, a song. ? Why are you crying? Because I love you, Chema, and now I'm the happiest man in the world! ~ The body of Christ. ~ Amen. My Lord, I thank You for making me an instrument of Your peace,... and I ask You, sir, that my modest work continue diligently with holy hands,... and give me strength for the new mission I must fulfill far away from here. ~ Good morning, Father. ~ Good morning. Come with me. I can't believe it, Father. Why recommended me to run the hospital? Because I have confidence in you, my son, as a physician and as a man. But it's such a long time since I've practiced, Father. Not in this town there, but you've been healing others for free. You think I did not know? Thank you, Father. Thanks to you I found the way... and now I've regained the joy of living and working. Do you think they will come to me? Do you think I can earn their trust? That's your doing, my son. Commend yourself to God. Love your people wholeheartedly, and He will not disappoint you. Fuck! Chema, come to dinner! Give me strength, Lord. Help me! Come sit down, Chema. I'll serve you. I'm not hungry. You eat. Is something wrong? Yes, something very serious. Then why not tell me? Come on, tell me. Listen well, Jos? Mar?a: I'm in one of those moments when I will do my duty no matter what the cost. Do you understand? ~ Well, what's wrong? Tell me. ~ Look, I'll explain. A priest is like a doctor who has to serve people, to help them thrive,... without much thought to himself. That's what you do every day. Yes, but to keep on doing it I must give up a lot. I can't hold on to anything or anyone or stay in one place. I am a servant of God and of the Church, and I must go where I'm sent. And just the day before the feast of San Jos?... I was ordered to move to a distant town in the mountains. So we go! What's the difficulty? The difficulty is that I can't take you along, Jos? Mar?a. No, I can't. There's no school. You have to study, and it's a very cold and poor region. I don't want to expose you to diseases and dangers. These are pure pretexts. I'm completely used to walking the forests and sleeping under the trees! No, I can't, Jos? Mar?a. We must part. You're breaking us up?? Separating you and me, Chema?? Yes, my son. It hurts my soul, but it's for the best. The best for whom? The best thing for me, because there'll be a lot of work, many concerns, and I can't take care of you further on. So I'm a nuisance? No, don't say that, you're everything to me! You've never been a nuisance! So why not take me with you? Because there...yes, you'd be an annoyance. But we won't part forever, only temporarily. I have it all arranged. Look, until we meet once again you'll live with mama Teresa. I don't want to live with her or anyone else, I want to live with you! Please, Jos? Mar?a, for pity's sake, don't make things more difficult, I myself wrote them to come for you! She loves you very much, she's very good, she's married to a good man, they have a very nice farm,... they'll take care of you like a son. You'll be happy. Enough of your arguments, Chema! And just answer me man-to-man: you just want to dump me, right. I must leave you. And I need you to live with mama Teresa and her husband so I can rest easy. They'll soon arrive. You promise me that you will live with them? Do you promise? Not in a million years will I force you to keep me here with you. I'll gather my things. Take it easy, Father, he can't have gone far. I just don't believe he's gone. He promised me that...no, he didn't promise me anything! I'll find him. No, Father, don't. I'll go look for him myself. ~ He must be with Edelmira, Father. ~ With Edelmira? Why? ~ Because... ~ Tell me. ~ Because they're a couple. ~ Ah. I'll go with Edelmira. ~ Come in, Father. ~ Leave me alone with her. I know you and Jos? Mar?a are very good friends, and he tells you everything, right? Was he here to see you earlier? ~ No. He didn't come see me. ~ Did he ask you not to tell me anything? No, really. Well, I believe you, Edelmira. You don't tell lies. Jos? had left, and he took no clothes, no food, nothing And wandering alone at night in the hazardous area risks being assaulted by someone out to steal the horse. ~ He took his gun. ~ Help me find him. Tell me, what did he say? ~ But I promised... ~ It's for his own good, Edelmira, understand this. that I'd never marry anyone else! ~ Have a good trip, Father. ~ Thank you. Goodbye. ~ Goodbye, Father. ~ Goodbye, ma'am. Good-bye, my children. Good-bye. And thank you. ~ Good-bye. ~ Good luck, Father. Farewell, Father. Have a good trip. Goodbye, Father Felipe. I'm content I'm leaving this place in very good hands. Thank you. ~ Goodbye, Father. ~ Goodbye, Father. Let's go. Farewell, Father! Farewell, Father! Goodbye, come back soon! If someday you take away the life of a man, You'll be taking MY life away. I'm home now, Chema, so you can stop worrying.
