YOU MEAN ARREST ME? YUP. NOW MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME FOR YOU TO TRY TO REMEMBER ANYTHING THAT YOU'VE FORGOTTEN. THERE'S NOTHING. LOOK, MAN. YOU'RE WHIPPED, HUH? I'M WHIPPED. YOUR NEW BOOK, WHAT'S THAT ABOUT? IT'S A MURDER MYSTERY ABOUT A MAN WHO KILLS HIS WIFE. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I WRITE: MYSTERIES. KIND OF LIKE WHAT KATIE SAID YOU DID. NO. IT'S FICTION. OH, YEAH? YOU THINK I'D ACTUALLY PUT IN A BOOK SOMETHING I DID OR WAS GOING TO DO? DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF AT ALL TO VERIFY YOUR STORY? HOW CAN I PROVE SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN? COME ON; THINK, RICHARD. OHH, I DON'T KNOW. MY... MY CLASS. I, UM, I YELLED AT HER IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CLASS... TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS CRAZY. YOU ASK THEM ABOUT IT. OKAY. NOW, ABOUT OTHER AFFAIRS. THIS WASN'T AN AFFAIR. THIS WAS AN ABERRATION, A DELUSION. WELL, THIS SORT OF DELUSION EVER HAPPEN TO YOU BEFORE, PROFESSOR? GOOD-LOOKING MAN LIKE YOU, SPEAKS WELL. BET THEY'RE THROWING THEMSELVES AT YOU ALL THE TIME. COULDN'T BE THE REASON YOU'RE ON WIFE NUMBER THREE, COULD IT? NO. IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE, HASN'T IT? IF YOU LIE TO US NOW, RICHARD, IT WILL NOT LOOK GOOD. I'M NOT LYING. IT'S EASY TO CHECK. NOW, IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE, HASN'T IT? IT'S ONE OF THE PERKS OF THE JOB. NO. DON'T BE STUPID, MAN. THIS IS STUPID. LOOK. IT'S NO BIG DEAL, BUT IT IS IF YOU LIE ABOUT IT. THEY KNEW I WAS MARRIED. IT WAS NEVER A BIG DEAL. BUT THIS KATIE THING... THIS KATIE THING IS NOT ONE OF THEM, I SWEAR TO YOU. WAS LAURA A STUDENT? WERE YOU ON WIFE NUMBER TWO WHEN SHE TOOK YOUR CLASS? I MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE HASTY IN REJECTING COUNSEL. YOU WENT TO BRENDA, WENT TO LAURA, BUT YOU NEVER CAME TO US. I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME. BRENDA DID. YOU REALIZE HOW BAD THIS LOOKS? I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS GOING TO GO THROUGH WITH IT. THEN WHY DID YOU GO TO LAURA? I REALIZE THAT WAS WRONG. WHY DIDN'T YOU COME TO US? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE... MAYBE YOU WERE HOPING HE'D DO IT. NO. NO. ONE OF OUR MEN TALKED TO BRENDA. AND? SHE VERIFIES YOUR STORY. YOU SEE? THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM. SHE NEVER SAW YOU WITH RICHARD. I NEVER SAID SHE DID. NO ONE CAN CORROBORATE YOUR STATEMENT. HE WANTED IT TO BE THAT WAY SO NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE ME. I NEED MORE, KATIE. HE TOLD YOU HE WOULD KILL HER. WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY? NOTHING. THAT'S ALL I KNEW. I KNEW WHEN HE WAS GOING TO DO IT, AND THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. KATIE. WHAT? AREN'T YOU GOING TO PICK UP THE PHONE? ♪ Ashes, we all fall down ♪ Hi, Sweetheart. Just thought I'd say hello. I'm on my way. TO WHERE? Just like we talked about. RICHARD, NO. It's arranged. Everything's set. PLEASE DON'T. I'll call you when I get back. I CAN'T LET YOU DO THIS. Do what? ♪ ♪ OKAY. OH, MY GOD, IT'S THE CAR. GOD. PULL OVER! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? PULL OVER! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? PULL... WHAT ARE YOU DOING? JEEZ, YOU'RE GONNA GET US... OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOSH. PULL OVER! PULL OVER! JEEZ. PULL OVER! OH! OH. OH. COME ON. OH, GOD! OH, MY GOD. YOU PUT YOUR LIFE IN DANGER TRYING TO WARN HER. MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T DO THAT. SHOW ME YOUR RING AGAIN. WHERE DID HE BUY IT? I DON'T KNOW. IS IT LAURA'S? DID YOU TAKE IT WHEN YOU WERE IN HIS HOUSE? NO. DID YOU BREAK INTO RICHARD'S HOUSE? NO. WHAT ABOUT THE AUTOGRAPHED BOOK HE GAVE YOU? HE TOOK IT WHEN HE BROKE INTO MYHOUSE. WHAT ABOUT THE LETTER? THE PICTURES? EXCEPT THE ONE. RIGHT. WHERE IS IT? I TOLD YOU; I HID IT. YOU WANTED HER OUT OF THE WAY, DIDN'T YOU? YOU WANTED RICHARD ALL TO YOURSELF. THAT IS NOT TRUE. YOU WERE A LOVE-STRUCK STUDENT INFATUATED WITH YOUR TEACHER. NO. STOP IT. DON'T SAY THAT. YOU HAD THE MOTIVE. YOU HAD A HISTORY OF HARASSING THEM. I TOLD YOU YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME. YOU DON'T HAVE ONE SHRED OF EVIDENCE YOU EVER HAD AN AFFAIR WITH RICHARD MANNHART. YES, I DO. WELL, THEN, WHAT IS IT, KATIE? TELL ME. SHOW ME. COME ON, KATIE, SHOW ME. I GO FROM HOME TO WORK AND BACK. SHOW ME. SHOW ME. SHOW ME. COME ON. SHOW ME, KATIE. THE TEXTURE, EVEN THE SMELL. IS THAT THE GLOVE HE LEFT IN YOUR ROOM? THAT'S YOUR PROOF? NO. THAT WAS THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE. DESK, WOULD YOU ASK JACKSON TO COME IN HERE, PLEASE? YOU'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL, KATIE. THANK YOU. WOULD YOU MAKE THIS YOUNG WOMAN COMFORTABLE? ARE WE DONE? YOU JUST GO WITH HER. WELL, HOW LONG? DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. SHE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU. THANK YOU. LANSING, THIS IS RICHARD MANNHART. SORRY.
