THE SCHOOL OF FLESH - What the hell? - lt's my brother's! Beat it or l'll tie you to a radiator. - My dues. - No rush. l prefer. But the showers are cold. Wait. You don't want to talk? You been skiing? Don't work too hard! Bye. How about there? lsn't it gay? Mixed. l've been there before. Do you serve coffee? What she needs is water. l adore your ring. A present? Family heirloom? He's looking at you. His name's Quentin. He never does that. He likes you. Careful. He's only into money. Ask him out one night. He's easy. Women, men... l'm not that desperate. Granted, you're pretty, but... paying can be fun. You can always swap roles. He can be violent. Sounds great! He's into boxing, but he's not a thug. Not really. And if he plays rough, l'm around. That ring is really stunning. What's your name? Dominique. Chris. Do you live alone? Me too. They come and go but never stay. He's still at it. lsn't he gorgeous? Time for bed. Don't you want to stay? Come back soon. Aren't you coming? l can't promise. lt's only a sample. There'll be two models. McGregor, Khoudia...and a boy. He hasn't been chosen yet. All very young. Dominique? Mrs. Thorpe is here. Tell her l'm coming. A subdued white background and a logo. l'll leave that to you. Good-bye. - Like it? - Lovely. They're your colors. lt catches the light nicely. lt's you. - Not too... - Tight? No. l'll watch my weight. l took the coat too. My daughter. Say hello, Marine. Dominique's a human being. She refuses to dress decently. l've given up! She's fine like that. Don't tell her! Come to dinner when l get back from Madrid. - Are you going for long? - A week and two days up north. We'll keep it cozy so we can talk. No more than six. Bring a man. Gin and tonic. lt's on me. lt's quiet here now. Like a regular bar. So you're a boxer? Yeah, kind of. - Any fights? - A couple. You're not scarred. l'm off on Tuesdays. We could... We can. What kind of food? That's up to you. The rest is up to me. l'm with her. - You had sex with them all? - They ask, not me. For them, l'm an object. They push their money at me. l take it. Why shouldn't l? lf it pays the rent... lt's good to be open-minded. One more, please. Don't get up. l found a paper your father wrote for a symposium. l'll mail it to you. - How have you been? - Fine. lt reminded me of the good times we all had. You were 10... and full of questions! l grew out of it. l'll be going. - What did your dad do? - Professor of medicine. What field? - Biology. - Any good? l think so. He wrote several books. About pain. l'd like to have met him. l can respect scientists. People who work on viruses and stuff. Sleazy business, though. lt wasn't in his day. Did he spoil you? He was quite cold but l liked him a lot. Did the money run out? Not at all. So why work? Too many women take jobs, neglect their kids, get divorced... Your views are traditional. Do you have kids? No, or you wouldn't be here. The seafood casserole? For me. And the sea bass. Put it down. - Why? - You're with me. Are you angry? That frown suits you. Can we go? What's the matter? Let's go. l said no. l'll wait outside. Looking for a good time? You're back? Try, it's easy. Do you drive? Little prick! l'm going home. l forgot to ask. When are you off next? Tuesday. Same time? lf you like. Want to go? l have no condoms. How careless. You come prepared. You're the pro! You know the ropes. Stay there. l'm going home, then to work. What time is it? For the room. That's too much. The rest is for you. l don't want it. Why not? lt was good for me too. No, take it. You don't get it. Let's say l'm buying your phone number. Deal. We may not meet again. ls that Dominique, the poor little rich girl? Thinking about you gets me hard. This is Quentin. Your message is a turn-off. Put some music on it. ls that Dominique, the poor little rich girl? l called and got weird noises. Maybe the number was a fake. l could ask at that bar but l don't want to. l have to get this out of my system. Do you like him? Really? Yes. And l paid him. That takes guts. l couldn't. Not that l could afford to. He refused. l insisted, like an idiot. No! You want to get me drunk? lt upset him, but he called. So you're a sugar-daddy now? That's new. Except that he's a guy and l'm a girl. ls he nice to you? - Was everything alright? - Very good. Excellent. Come out for a drink. Not me, thanks. Another time. ls this a good idea? We're here now. lt must be his day off. You want a drink? You want to leave? Hi, Dominique. He didn't show up tonight. l thought maybe he was with you. He didn't call? No. Would l lie? Did he leave with a client? No. Cross my heart. Stay and browse. Have a drink. Take him as he is. Where does he live? Out by Bagnolet, near the subway. But at this time of night... She looks lost. l'm going. l'll call you. Hi. You want to quit your job? l don't know. You skipped it tonight. l wish you'd quit. l'll quit when l like. Jobs are rare. l'll take responsibility. Take your time finding another one. l'll help you. Trust me. So you can dump me? Shit! You're pale. You look different by day. l brought you a... lt's only a book l like. How kind of you. l haven't read it. Thank you. Some champagne? Two champagnes. Have you ever been married? To a childhood friend. Any...? l hate kids. They irritate me. l'd be a lousy mother. So? Has he ever been in a serious relationship? lt's not his style. There was one guy. A lawyer, one of those charity types. They lived together a while. A bigwig, named Soukaz. l read an article by him. But... l barely met him. l was an embarrassment. Some fags detest people like me. Tell me all you know. That's all. l've never even seen his lD. l searched through his stuff once. Quentin isn't his real name. Try looking farther south. There's a streak of Arab in him. He grew up in some low-rent suburb. Bretigny-sur-Orge, as l recall. Creatures of the night keep their secrets well. Do we shock you? Not really. But when you delve deeper... lt gets to you. Are there dangers in what he does? We're all somebody's trick or whore. l suppose so. He likes you. He really does. Did he tell you? l have eyes. Maybe you can help him. He's had a tough life. l'll spare you the sob story, but... it's a delicate matter. l don't want to hurt your feelings for him but he's deep in debt. He owes money to the bar, the owner, me... and some real tough cookies. How much? Was this his idea? No. My suggestion is... we settle his debt. l can handle the owner. Then you can take it easy. You can find him a job or only pretend to, depending on how you feel. Not now. Let's get it done. Fill in the name. Don't tell him. l disappoint you. No, it makes sense. l'm glad it came from you. lf he's a bad boy, tell me. l can fend for myself. Been a girl long? l started young. Just left home and kept going. Do you love him? l know he's in good hands. lt's a mess and there's nothing to drink. Could l have some water? Why did you want to come? To see where you live. See? lt's ugly. lt's only temporary. l want you to live with me. Sorry to intrude. Call me back. Some of us are late bloomers. Yes, bye. God, it's quiet here! Why won't you discuss your family? Or your friends? We're together, but don't tie me down or you'll get hurt, okay? Don't lecture me. We play it day by day. l move around a lot. When we're in, we're in. Tonight, l'm in. l won't do this every night. l'm not asking you to. Not in so many words. l agree. We must be temperate. What's ''temperate''? You're right. Let's sleep. lf l was old and ugly, what would you do? When l'm old, you'll be dead but what if l lost an arm or a leg or my cock? What would you do? Keep me or dump me? l'd try to be supportive. But you wouldn't love me. l don't know. Don't worry. You like the material? ls it light enough? He wears it well. Head up a little. Hand in your pocket. Your right hand. Look slowly back this way. Look at me. Really look at me. Okay, let's take a break. - How's it going? - Not so easy. You'll see. He's cute, but... Checking up on me? Did he tell you about me? lt wasn't him. We're strangers, yet you want to discuss him. Yes, in a moment. What's he doing now? Living with me. Good luck. ln your house, or with you? He's in and out. Count the silver. l'm only joking. Did you know him... Very well. Too well? l defended his mother when she was illegally fired. He wanted to beat up her boss. And his father? l see he tells you nothing. His father's a Berber. l'm not sure they've met. Can you spare me a minute more? He slept here for a while. Right there. lt was havoc. We kept different hours. Do you blame him? But deep down he's cold. l'm being unfair. He was paying his brother's medical bills. Some situations are too much for people. Now you're generalizing. We live in violent times! There are precedents. l'm not optimistic. You have an advantage. What's that? He desires only himself. Even so, he prefers women. The rest is an aptitude. A disturbing one. l can't say any more. l'm sorry, l have work to do. l understand. There's always a risk of corrupting him more. But you're right to try. He dreads being abandoned. Don't tell him we... l don't want to see him again. l hardly ever go there now, alas. l'll see you later. Fraternizing? He has sad eyes. People who lose power... He was a congressman at 28. What a triumph! Looks like it. Here comes our friend. He trails me like a puppy. l'll take him in hand. What are you gabbing about? You look good in a suit. So l've heard. Makes you different. Keep your guard up. Are you hostile? Of course not. l won't hurt her. You must be delighted. l think so. The press reacted well for once. They certainly seemed to. The buzz feels very good. Who are you? Quentin, a friend. Laurence Thorpe. Are you a model? You should be. My daughter. l must mingle. Listen, l know you'll say no but that green chintz dress would look perfect on you. Of course. lf she doesn't like it... What do you do for a living? That's impolite! You were blonder. Am l wrong? - Everyone quizzed you on politics. - You didn't. You were tight-lipped. That was my undoing. You wore a black gown. You remember that? Excuse me. Are you hiding me or what? l have to mix. lt's my job. You're good at it. lt's weird, seeing you nude and then here. Who was that guy? You're not too bored? Go on, don't waste your time on me. Tomorrow night we'll stay in. l'll order from Tong's. You'll cook. These rich pricks make me puke. Show-offs! You're only passing through. l love you. Me too. Pigging out? Ask for a doggy bag. Who let you in? She invited me. Satisfied? Still washing glasses? Laugh while you can. Quentin! Help me work out? Other side, go on. That's it. Go on. Where are you at? Knee. Knee! Switch legs. Can you put on a shirt for dinner? What? One day l'll tell you things about me. l'm not asking. l'll tell you anyway. Are you never curious? You miss talking, don't you? This food is really good. - Not too overcooked? - l don't like it rare. You were hungry. We could eat in every night. You really think so? You hardly ate a thing. Was your husband nice to you? Nice? He was very nice. Why did you leave him? l was bored. lt took me time to admit it. Are you bored with me? Maybe if we'd met in other circumstances we'd have nothing to say. We'd be bored. You'd be bored, too. But so what? No man will ever give you what you want. Mom at work. Cafeteria. You're up? This is Marcus, a friend. Sometimes we work together. You haven't slept much. Good night out? No, it stunk. Every place we went was dead. Tight-assed women. We wound up with our friends, the drag queens. The coatroom girl likes Marcus. Did you see her hands? Like paddles! Yeah, it stunk. But still, you stayed. Just to see you cry. You wanted a shower. lt's through there. Don't make a mess. What do we do with you? l could tell you to pack up and get out. l kept thinking about it all night long. But you'd be miserable. Deny it. lt's instant. Give me a cigarette. l don't think you'll go the distance. Then leave. l had an idea. We could take a trip away together. lf you can take the time off. l know where. You want to hear? l don't care. Okay, we can go. On one condition. What's that? Come here. Turkey breast or fillet of fish? Fillet of fish. lt's me. You're not at work? What's up? Nothing, why? What are you doing? Now, nothing. l went to the travel agent. We leave on Saturday. l booked us into the hotel. Happy? When will you be home? At 7 o'clock. l feel down. Cheer up. Bye. l saw your mother. She's beautiful. l didn't speak to her. What have you been up to? You're crazy. She stared at me. l thought... l could help her, if you want. She has all she needs. And l'm around. You think you can buy everything? Not buy. Know. l thought it was by the sea! Around your neck! All you see is men. That's how it is. Feels weird, a street with no women. Strange smell, too. lt's spices. Spices and shit. This isn't Switzerland. They can wash. They wash more than us. At the baths. They fuck there too. No. They're single-sex. l know. l saw the hotel has a casino. lt does? You Arabic? French, come see. They stick like glue! Don't be scared. l just hate them staring at you. Come in, look around. No need to buy. We have teapots, tajine dishes, big size, small size... ls it ovenproof? Of course. Feel it. See how heavy it is? Hand-made, hand-painted... - Sucking every dick in the bazaar? - You creep! One dick for each hole? Don't touch me! Zehmel! Stop it! Stay clear of me! Do you work there full time? lt's seasonal. l'm a student. l have a room in Gueliz. You can rest there if you're tired. l'm going back. ls there a flight to Paris tonight? l'm sorry. The next one's at 7:30 a.m., on standby. Miss? The young man is waiting by the pool. We kidnapped Quentin. How amazing to see you! You know my husband. Do sit down. l should change. Where were you? Quentin looked for you. l went for a long walk. Have dinner with us. l don't think so. You got lost? Exactly. There's so much to do here! You saw the Menara? Not yet. lt's a simple house on a lake, where the Sultan's soldiers practiced sea fightint. lt's so elegant! The light is magnificent. Yes! At sunset, in one second, it changes from bright yellow to mauve, to milky white... You should write, Mom. Marine! See how they treat me? Because we can't match your curiosity, my dear, and your benevolence. He never leaves the hotel! What about you, Quentin? Are you finding your roots? With a vengeance! Do you speak Arabic? lt's a beautiful country. How about tennis tomorrow? l'm not very good. Then you're my man. People here are so beautiful. Their eyes, their skin... The men. You can't see the women. That veil makes me uneasy. lt's like a muzzle. What do you think, Marine? You haven't eaten a thing! Eat up. Are you here for long? Until Wednesday. We must all go to Ourika. They do delicious tajines. Stand up to her. Anywhere you like, except the bazaar! l'm hungry! l'm very happy to see you. Today l thought... What? ...that you planned this trip... to tell me it was over. They seem pretty close. Who? Oh, yes. She's the one l find touching. The daughter? The mother. Quentin? Can we stop making war? What goes on in your mind? We're ships in the night. He sets time aside for his mother and brother... l'm not worthy to meet them. He disappeared last weekend and brought me back a rather ugly ashtray. Since we got back we've had, what... one night together? He won't change overnight. To each his weapon. lt's on the house. Why? Thanks, Louis. At least things happen to you. But when they stop... it's not much fun. Shall we move on? lf l look at him coldly... Who are you kidding? lf l try to, l can't even see him as a nice person unless l force myself. lt's not his job. l wake up and it's so obvious: Leave him! Leave him! Like a mantra? Maybe one day it'll work. We should find you another man, but you'd reject him. Your guy's a pirate. Did you drink a lot? Does it bother you? l'm not a fan. Women drink to drown their sorrows. Don't men? Yes, but men drink to get over it. Women wallow in it. Let's dance. A slow one? You're attractive...and charming. l am? Attractive and charming? l've had my apartment redone. You can keep your live-in boy... And she needn't know. Dance. Where have you been? You smell of booze. Go to sleep. Very pretty. You can also wear it like this with the sleeve at the elbow. What sort of shoes would l wear? Very simple ones. Evening sandals, or even barefoot. What's the occasion? l may get engaged. Engaged? Congratulations. ls that still done? May l ask to whom? A boy. My parents like him a lot. Good. But he's not marrying them. We get along very well. Don't say l told you. l came across a check from you among Quentin's things. Don't give him money. l'm sorry, but he's an adult and l'm not at your command. l felt this coming. l think we're wasting our time. lt's between him and me. Allow him that freedom. More tea? But why? He has all he wants. lt's never enough. Do you see him often? How does it work between you? Financially, l mean. You brought it up. l give him an allowance paid into his bank account. How much? Sorry. The things you make me say! He told me some lie about being in debt. But you paid up. - To get rid of him. - Really? That's not all. Fatherly feelings linger on. You might not understand. l do. l know you meant a lot to him. l used to. l was thinking the other day... Seeing him after so long, hearing his fibs... l felt more like... The tea's stewed. Did he stay the night? Don't waste your energy on that. lt's to my credit. He's so willing and l can still see he's beautiful, but... it leaves me cold. He talked about you, unasked. He has the gift of looking at someone and then portraying them. l see what he likes... He never tells me. You teach law, too? l started out as a teacher. l've always enjoyed it. You don't smile much. lt runs in the family. Good-bye, Dominique. lt's money that ruins us. ls that naive? Can l buy you a drink? lf you want. Sit down. We can talk for a minute. My man just walked by. l don't want to run after him. lt tires me, you know? But l can't see myself in bed with someone else. That's why l said we can talk, no more. Have you ever done that to a woman? Shadowed her like a cop? lt happens to everyone. A beer for the lady. At school, l was deeply in love with an older woman. lt wasn't my initiation. She knew how l felt but it never came to anything. lt preyed on my mind. Maybe l never grew up. What are you saying? l'm like that woman? No, not at all. But l'd like to look at you. May l? Here l am. Your friend refused to tell me anything about you. ''Be bold'', she said. ''Take the plunge.'' She really said nothing? Are you surprised? l know you're not married... but l'd rather know nothing. lf l were bolder, l'd have asked you to come away with me for a few days. To a museum, a nice hotel, a beach... Get acquainted, stroll around... But you'd have... l'd probably have come. - Where's your car? - Far. - Sorry l made you... - l enjoyed the walk. - l live here. - l know. l hope we'll meet again. Why don't you come in? You're sure you live here? Do you want a drink? - What? - Whatever. - With ice? - No need. Nothing for you? Should we whisper? ls there a sleeping child? Excuse me. l'm still here. l have to go. Nobody's here. Go back to sleep. l have to go away... ...for a few days. Don't worry, kiddo. l won't be far. You're home? l wrote you a note. l brought some croissants. Where's my black bag? Long time no see. He never comes anymore. He's washed his hands of me. Like you. No news of him? Someone said he saw him. Where? Who? A nasty little liar, a squirt. l have work to do. Where did he see him? Listen to you! l'm no snitch. Work it out with him. What do you want? Money? Oh, sure. l want money. Love hasn't made you human. You really want to get out here? Yes, really. - What the hell? - Come on home. - Women don't come here. - They do now. - Busy night? - l'm not working. You enjoy it. Not especially. You do enjoy it. l don't. l've always been up-front about it. When l hustled, l was free. You can't understand. Come on. l make $500 an hour here. - l'll pay. - You're not so rich. Go away, l'm embarrassed. What about me? Keep it down! What's so funny? - Want a fight? - Come on. Asshole! Tell me what you want. l've had to spend a lot. On what? Your family? Tell me! l haven't seen them for a month. On someone else? Yes. Who? Are you keeping somebody? l don't get it. No, but l have expenses. l met a girl. You'll meet her. Let's go. You have somebody, too. You slept with him. He left his cigars. You don't smoke cigars. Was it good? Yes. Big girls don't cry. l'm not crying for myself. Feel me. You turn me on. l'm tough on you but nobody turns me on like you. You'll miss me. Quiet, we have plenty of time. l'll get over it soon. lt's not serious. Let's double-date. Me and her, you and him. lt could be fun. How about it? Come on, let's go home. So how do l play this? You said you'd enjoy it. David Cordier. Quentin. Hard place to find. ls your friend here? She's out in the hall. She's scared to... Bring her in. You think so? lt's not a mistake? l'll be back. l understand now. Nice smile. l didn't want to come. She's jealous. l said it's dumb. Marine Thorpe, David Cordier. Sit down. Was the dress a success? How long have you...? Don't ask. You'll flip. Does your mother know? No problem on that score. We're all here, so let's order. - lt's my treat. - Let me. l insist. Pretty pricey. Not if you're rich. Meaning? lt was just a remark. How did you two meet? Personal ads. A dating service? You taught him bad manners. You go well together. Very uptown. To each his own. Who goes with whom? We could draw lots. You could end up with me. Thorpe? Are you related to the president of Alcitel? He's my father. l used to know him quite well. A brilliant man. Very amusing. On the surface. ls he strict at home? Not with you. No. Not even when l make mistakes. Are you ready to order? l'll have a teriyaki, please. Let's eat. We don't have to talk. We'll have two shabu-shabus. We began badly. Let's start again. - Can l come in? - l'd rather not. You can call me any time. l'll be there. Stay with me. Don't go. Where can we go? Back to the Hilton? l'm broke. l'm not. Forget it. Plus you're under age. l could get busted. Come upstairs. l don't want to sneak in. You know what l mean? Where's the mustard? On the second shelf. lt's not. Wait. Got it. Don't get up. Take it easy. Have another drink. You washed your hands? All set to eat. lt's ready. This is almost over. You like it? You used shallots? A little. l'm getting married. The woman you live with? No. She's great, but... No, to a girl younger than me. Does she work? She's a student. How will you get by? l've got my job. Chew your food. Why marry now? Your whole life is ahead of you. My life's already old. l tried to call, but you avoided me. l felt l'd been lying to you. l'm very fond of you. l like you too. Then let's try to look at this differently. Let's be happy and say we're marrying our children. Where's the list? l'll provide the reception. What do you think? You and Mr. Thorpe? We were afraid at first. The boy has no background. We met him through you. That was our guarantee. But isn't it the last thing you'd wish for your daughter? You know my wishes don't count. Jean-Michel dotes on Marine. He can't say no to her. She's never been in love before. How touching. And he can't stop her from seeing him. She'd throw tantrums, run away... She's like that. Let her go. She'll soon come running home in tears. She's a baby. l'm not asking you to understand her. The real surprise was Quentin. We've asked him over often. That's nasty. Don't be angry. What could l do? l was torn. One evening he told us all about his life. Unburdened himself. What did he say? l'd love to know. Everything. The shabby little jobs, living hand-to-mouth... What else? He was so beautiful then. l mean truly beautiful. He touched us deeply in his own words. He has that power, even over my husband. How strange. l would have thought he'd scare him off. You'd think so. But you know... Life is so much more bizarre. When l got married, a busybody told me Jean-Michel was bisexual. He isn't. l'd have known. But he likes to be with handsome men. You're all touched. What else did he say? That he escaped from that... series of disasters...thanks to you. The bastard. He didn't actually say it. How stupid of me! l'm sorry. l know he's gotten under your skin... Look, l'm being frank with you because you're strong. lt had to happen. What? A relationship for him not based purely on... gratitude. You're right, you're stupid. l can't say anything right! May l? lt's been going on for months. Morocco was no coincidence. They planned it. l had no idea. lt isn't a crush. She's sure she can save him. From me? No! She can give him a chance. What can you give him? My husband can hire him, train him fast... Crazy. Then how do you ditch him? You're bitter... Be quiet! l'm not bitter. What if l keep him? You can't control him. l can. You're being selfish. You're totally clueless. Who are you to give me a lecture? You can't know what we've shared. Few women can. You said l could come to you. l did. He's been horrible to you. All for a spoiled little brat. How banal! Next step, baby and nanny... lt's upstairs. Do you hate him? No... But l could kill him. My humble abode. ls that you? My Jean Seberg phase. lt'll help you relax. l haven't smoked pot for years. Here they are. Did you take them? But l was in the house. l hid the guy. The music drowned the noise. Why did you do it? l wanted a hold on him but l didn't want to use it. Only because it's you. You don't have to. You've got the balls. You can go there. Quentin at work in his birthday suit. l'm a bit of a witch. Show me your hand. l see a wedding. Very funny. Not his, yours. When l like someone, my vision blurs. Your hands aren't girlish. But l am a girl. And by choice. Having a cuddle? Chris, can l...? Sure. The water's hot. lsn't he cute? He's learning to be a plumber but he's very open-minded. Does he live in? He showers here and sometimes stays. l get paid in kind. lf he's nice, l'll get him a job. At the bar? Or as a bouncer. The photographs are yours, for free. He'll eat dirt. lf he doesn't, then destroy him. ls he there? What are those pictures? - Where were you? - At the movies. With your girlfriend? No, l was alone. What did you see? Was it you who called? Yes. l ate with my father-in-law. Dinner at 8. Early to bed. How did it go? Not too bad. He likes me as long as l agree with him. Did you behave? Are you mad at me? What do you think? lf you are, you're right and wrong. Meaning? We can still see each other. l'll be a husband, not a monk. You're not married yet. As good as. Does she love you? Yes. Too much. She can act spoiled. She has whims. Are you one? Maybe. Why can't we... No. l'm not Soukaz. That's the point. Marine is pretty and fresh. Nice little puss... Stop it. Take a look. What is it? Pictures. Look. l prefer when you don't pose. l didn't know you did that too. You're so amenable. lt's part of nature. They use you like a rag. Did you mail them? Not yet. l'm thinking about it. l'm in no rush. Do it. Teach them about life. Don't put it past me. l'll kill her. Who? The sneaky bitch.
