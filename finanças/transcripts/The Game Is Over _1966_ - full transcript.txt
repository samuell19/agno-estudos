THE GAME IS OVER Do it again, for me. Stay stiII. Attack! You Iook ridicuIous this morning. Does this siIIy morning workout reaIIy do anything? ''Starting in their twenties... ''women need to watch their figures. ''MuscIe tone....'' -But.... -Shut up. Your husband has strange habits. He set his dogs on me. Think it's funny? -They stop when he bIows the whistIe. -What if the whistIe's bIocked? No more Maxime. I wonder if I'm anything more than just an object to him. He must have decided to have a son, 22 years ago... and had one with my mother. Then... he checked the box marked ''son,'' and here I am. What about me? He checked the box marked ''wife,'' and here you are. Was he sad when your mother died? I don't know. I was 2 years oId. He might have been angry. He doesn't Iike to Iose. Good dog. Lie down! NATIONAL SCHOOL OF ORIENTAL LANGUAGES -It's okay. -I'm an idiot. Renee! -Did you see that? -That? I'm going for it. Watch me. Get out! -I toId you to get out! -Okay, but with you. You drive a Jeep. You're in the army? Student. -What are you studying? -Russian. So why the Jeep? It goes everywhere, dents bumpers when I park... and traffic wardens think it's an army vehicIe. So, you're not in the army. Maxime! Are you coming tomorrow? What did she say? ''HeIIo my dear Maxime! I'm in Iove with you!'' -SeriousIy? -Yes, absoIuteIy. -You reaIIy think so? -Look at her. She adores you. And so she shouId. -WiII you have a Iot of chiIdren? -OnIy boys. -Know how much Anne's dad weighs? -8) kg? 2) or 3) biIIion. -I see. -TeII me... why did you come to get me? I have a favor to ask. -WiII you do it? -Ask me. -WiII you do it? -I'II do it. -Promise? -Okay, I promise. It has to do with Armand. He wants to see me tonight. He needs to taIk. -That moron knows how to taIk? -Shut up. -TaIk to you about what? -Him, me.... About him and me. ''We shouId go away together, Renee.'' I see. You want me to come aIong? Don't be stupid. No. I've decided to break up with him. It'd be easier if you were there. WiII you come? Out of the question, oId Iady. Find someone eIse. You're furious because I'm cheating on your father. -Aren't we going back to my car? -Ask the chauffeur, or take a taxi. Thanks a Iot. I'm meeting my Chinese friend. He must be getting impatient. Chinese peopIe, especiaIIy this one, hate waiting. WeII! What do you do with your Chinese friend? TeII me. It's a mystery. Let's give it a try. -Not quite. Mr. Saccard? -Yes? Listen carefuIIy. That's it. Perfect. CouId you teach me a Chinese song? CertainIy. Here's one. Let's try it. -FeeI Iike a drink? -It'd do me good. Why's that? If I'd stumbIed, that dog wouId've ripped me apart. That's why you shouId never stumbIe. How's business? -Not bankrupt yet? -Not yet. You're ruining other peopIe? -For now. -Perfect. StiII interested in the Third WorId? I'm having dinner with them tonight. -With your wife? -No. Life is empty without you - goodbye! your Iover - armand HeIIo. Can you beIieve... someone just tried to kiII me. A poIiticaI attack? Any suspicions? None. I'II get my Chinese friend to investigate. CouId he aIso investigate my poor Iover's suicide? Everything okay, kids? Did I hear gunshots? Your wife tried to kiII me. UnfortunateIy, I missed. Did you eat at the Negroes'? With important Africans, not Negroes... at the Ivory Coast embassy. It was effective, as Maxime wouId say. Heard the one about the CongoIese who goes to the UN with a wheeIbarrow? The ambassador toId it. You've heard it? Damn. BIacks Iove teIIing bIack jokes.... I might go to the Ivory Coast this month. You're invited. There's a fantastic hoteI with a zoo and a pooI-- -You buiIt it? -He no buiId hoteI. That not his Iine of business. You go with him to Ivory Coast? -WiII you stay Iong? -Three or four days. If it's just to see a hoteI.... -You couId go on a safari. -It'd be a nice change. -Rather than firing at me-- -I couId kiII monkeys. Same thing. I'm off. Good night. Good night. Here's a piece of evidence for your Chinese friend. What's Maxime doing? Go get him, pIease. I'II try. Ladies and gentIemen.... HeIIo. FeeIing good? CouId be better. -You went to bed Iate. -6:)) a.m. -I had a great time. -Where? At CasteI. We ceIebrated the armistice. ReaIIy? What armistice? Two guys had a fight. We puIIed them apart... and ceIebrated the armistice. Very cooI. You shouId come one night. You're on your own, kids. That guy is so annoying... with his ridicuIous ruIe... that we have to be here for breakfast. FamiIy is famiIy. -To my office. -Yes, sir. -I was Iooking for you. -Mr. Maxime.... -Where is the Iady? -In her room. -Is that for Mr. Saccard's Green BaII? -Yes. Do I Iook handsome? The YeIIow PeriI! What happened to you? Is that a cast? It's anti-wrinkIe cream. You Iook ridicuIous. And you don't? What are you supposed to be? Genghis Khan. 1162-1227. Tartar conqueror! MongoI emperor! -No way! -Dreaded for his crueIty and vioIence! -It's not true! -A terribIe despot, with no sense of humor! -No sense of irony! -An idiot? Wears his boots in women's beds! -He's a Iecher, too? -With his boots on! -You're crazy! Stop! -1162! -1227! -You're crazy! Death! Where is the Iast sutra? -TeII me! -Have pity. Don't kiII me. Your Iips, sIave! Have pity on a poor sIave. Genghis Khan knows no pity! You can take my body, you tyrant, but you won't have my souI! So... I'II take... your body! I wear my boots in women's beds! -What? -Open up! That's enough, Maxime! Death! HeIIo, Maxime. WeII, weII. Is it you, Renee? Yes, it's me. -Where were you? -In China. Tartaria. I just got back. -Did you have a good trip? -Not bad. It was a very pIeasant trip. I'II get changed. I'II forgive your Iateness because you're so beautifuI. Renee! Ravishing, as aIways. See you Iater. Madam is served. Dinner is served. -Have you seen Maxime and Anne? -They're in the winter garden. Dinner is served. Anne! Maxime! Dinner is served! Come here! Dinner is served! What? Dinner is served! What.... What are you doing? My mother-in-Iaw is crazy. Look. -She eats poison. -I was hungry. You'II be sick. Spit it out. AII of it. Go on, spit. If one day your egg were too hard or too soft... wouId you fire the cook? You don't boiI eggs for a Iiving if you don't know how. HeIIo. You didn't sIeep weII? -Eat. You'II feeI better. -I'm not hungry. Eating poison takes away your appetite. Poison? She eats poisonous fIowers in the greenhouse. ShouId I caII a doctor? I'II be fine. Lend me your car? -Why? -I'm going for Iunch. -Your Jeep broke down? -It's an eIegant Iunch. I'm supposed to Iook Iike Saccard's son. What? The key's in my purse, on the cupboard. Where? On the cupboard. -Come and find it for me. -Look-- I'm in a hurry. Maxime, stop it! -Let me go! -Let you go? Okay. I'II get even. You know, Maxime... I reaIIy tried to Iove your father, at first. I tried, but I couIdn't. You know how proud he is. One day, he gave me my own bedroom. He never asked anything of me again. -Don't you Iike my hair? -I don't Iike eating it. -Do you think it's too Iong? -No. -You prefer short hair? -I Iove short hair. -Like Anne's hair? -Not especiaIIy. That's when I met Saccard. I come from a rich famiIy. By marrying me, he couId go back to his business in Paris. I just wanted to get out of there. So, you saved each other's Iives. There you are. You heard I Iiked whores. What's your name? Mimi Van Spoutnik. How much? Twenty. Twenty what? 2),))) oId francs. Give me one night. One night in a bed. In a bed? What's the difference? -Let's take a trip. -Where? Wherever you want. -How about Capri? -Perfect. Why not Saint-Tropez or DeauviIIe? Saccard wiII know our secret within 24 hours. You reaIIy have great ideas. I pIan to be back on Tuesday. I'II send a teIegram if I stay Ionger. ''Love and kisses, everything's fine. Stop. I Iove you. AIexandre.'' Goodbye. Have a good trip! I'm going on a trip, too. -You're Ieaving? -Where? To OIoron, in the Pyrenees. In a Jeep? If you Iend me your car... and if your husband has no objections, I'II take you. What's going on in OIoron? My Chinese friend, Mr. Chou Kai Ming. -He invited me. -He's from OIoron? He's tired of Paris. And it's a good pIace for rugby. The season's starting. I'II see a few games. I see. Enjoy the rugby, kids. My greetings to your Chinese friend. Let's go. I didn't think you wanted to go away with me. What changed your mind? I don't mind deceiving him under his roof when he's home... but taking advantage of his absence is immoraI. UtterIy immoraI. I'II caII Mr. Chou Kai Ming to teII him we're coming. Are we off? As soon as you're ready. I'II give the bicycIe back to the postwoman. I want to take the bed. Think the owner wouId give it to me? I don't know. Why? Because it's the first entire night I've spent with you. I want to keep it as a souvenir. Good idea. Great. ShaII we take a shortcut? Is it on the map? If it was on the map, it wouIdn't be a shortcut. -We're not Iate. -ExactIy. Luxury... is having pIenty of time for shortcuts. -Take the shortcut. -Okay. It's the most devious shortcut I've ever known. It's out for a Sunday drive. shortcut, gentiI shortcut shortcut, je te pIumerai! shortcut comes back from war Three shortcuts to saint Eloi Going to see another shortcut! shortcuts in the fields, blooming, blooming shortcuts in the fields, blooming in the month of May The girls of Camaret all take the big road But when they're in my Ford They prefer my shortcut! There was a shortcut There was a shortcut she didn't know which to choose It's a little shortcut -How about a kiss? -Ask me in Chinese. The road disappeared. Thanks again. Goodbye. It's Maxime. Mrs. Saccard. You'II join us for a cup of tea? Sir? I'd Iove to, Mr. Chou. First, we need to get our car towed out of the pond. -You had an accident? -Nothing serious. We just don't Iook very presentabIe. My wife. Mrs. Saccard. -HeIIo. -Mr. Maxime. It'II be hard on a Sunday... but Ho, my brother-in-Iaw... who works in Lacq, can heIp you. They have Iots of equipment there. Show the Iady to her room so she can get changed. This way, pIease. I'II drive you to the Lacq factory at dawn. -What are you going to do here? -Here? AgricuIture. AgricuIture. -No chiIdren aIIowed. -No chiIdren. Wait for me. I'II be back with Mr. Ho. Look. 65) miIIion! In 1) years, there'II be nothing but Chinese here. The avant-garde. I Iove you. I'II get away, thanks to Mr. Chou's friendship. I reaIIy Iove you. What are we going to do? Get the car out of the pond... and take the train back to Paris. We can't do that anymore. I'm scared, Maxime. You're the first person I've met who's afraid to take the train. We can't go on Iike before. I don't want to go back to Paris. You don't have to come with me. You're free, after aII. -How did you get your fiIm so fast? -Overnight. I took it straight to the Iab when we arrived. I got it back today, after Iunch. You see? I screwed up. No, it's good. I'd forgotten about that! Goodbye, Mr. Chou. Goodbye, Mrs. Chou. Goodbye, IittIe Chou. Thanks again, Mr. Ho. I'm going to bed. I'm dead tired. What are you doing? -I'm going to sIeep with you. -You can't. I Iearned bad habits from you. When you do your groceries, buy Fruite. Created by Evian, Fruite is a healthy, thirst-quenching drink for the whole family. Don't look underneath. There's nature inside a tall glass of Fruite. -That hurts. -What are you taIking about? You reaIIy hurt me. -Give me that key. -I ate it. What if Saccard comes home suddenIy? There's no fIight from Conakry tonight. I caIIed OrIy. You know him. He couId come via Moscow or New York. Imagine him surprising us: ''My wife with my favorite son!'' Good night. AIready? What do you mean? I thought you were coming tonight. Change of pIans. I came via Rome. Coffee's terribIe on the pIane. -Did the trip wear you out? -No. -I have to go. -Where's the fire? I have an optionaI cIass. -I decided to go. -Great. GIad you're so keen. Sure. -Where's Renee? -In her room, I suppose. -She hasn't come down yet? -No. Did you bring me a souvenir from your trip? Oh, sorry.... I forgot. -What's wrong, Maxime? -Nothing. Why? -You're acting Iike an idiot this morning. -ReaIIy? I'm going to shave. See you Iater. -Did Tonnerre eat yet? -Yes, sir. He Iooks Iike he's better. Were you awake when madam came in this morning? Madam didn't go out Iast night. Madam and Mr. Maxime stayed here. -The dogs have eaten? -Of course. You were the IoveIiest tonight, as usuaI. Your neighbor didn't take his eyes off you. SpeIIbound. -The Minister? -Yes. What wouId become of me, without you? I wouIdn't worry about that. A drink, before we go to bed? I'm so tired, I can hardIy keep my eyes open. Good night. What are you doing here? You scared me. Why wouId I scare you? I was in the Iibrary getting a book. Not tired anymore? Where were you going? I was getting some mineraI water. There's some on the tabIe. You're absent-minded. You're right. How siIIy of me. Good night. You're very beautifuI. -Look, your dad. -What? Your dad! -Your dad! -He's doing fine, thanks. No. There! Hi, Anne. You're aIone? Renee's not with you? She's at home. Don't say a word. What are you doing? Letting Ioose? I was about to go home. Come on. I'II buy you kids a drink. Sorry, but I reaIIy have to go. Find what you were after? Another one? You're trying to kiII me. You sure can hoId your Iiquor. Way to go! What are you ceIebrating? -Nothing. -That's no good. -It's my stag party. -No kidding. I'm getting married. I don't beIieve it! To who? To Renee. More preciseIy.... I aIready remarried Renee. HoId on, AIexandre. You mean you weren't aIready married to your wife? In a way, no. Know what I mean? Here's to the young husband. -What you mean is-- -ExactIy. I was asking the neighbor for rice whiIe my basement was fuII... Iike the Chinese proverb says. That's a Chinese proverb? That's what they say. Is it working? With the young bride? Better than ever. Better than I ever imagined. I'II have to buy you a wedding gift. You're sure it's working? Why shouIdn't it? Aren't you sIeeping? I waited for you at breakfast. I didn't sIeep weII. I haven't been sIeeping weII IateIy. Take some piIIs. Maxime didn't come home Iast night. That doesn't worry me. If there's been an accident, I'd know about it. That's not what I mean. Twice this week, he didn't come home. It's a bit much. Maybe he's in Iove. Stop it! -Come in. Who is it? -Your father. Hi, Saccard! -I have a present for you. -ReaIIy? Let's see. Your present is next weekend. I invited Anne Sernet and her parents to go duck hunting. Are you happy? DeIirious. Try to contain your enthusiasm. TeII me, Saccard.... Did you want to spend a quiet weekend with Mr. Sernet? To taIk business with the banker? Weren't you thinking: ''If I invite Anne... ''she'II convince Sernet to accept the invitation''? -What's wrong with that? -Nothing. Your business is my pIeasure. We share the work. DoubIe whammy! You broke my record. I'm torn between admiration and jeaIousy. One doesn't excIude the other. I'II choose admiration, anyway. I've hunted a Iot in Canada... but I don't care for it anymore. Anne, behind the reeds! -How many victims? -She's a good shot. BuII's eye every time. EspeciaIIy at night, targeting unarmed men. -On, Renee! -Maxime! Look out! The enemy! Never do that. I spent my two cartridges. I know, but it's a matter of principIe. -What were you doing, dear? -I was on the phone with NathaIie. She spends haIf her Iife on the phone. She's at that age. Think so? Maxime hates taIking on the phone. Where is he? I don't know. In his workshop. -I wanted to wish him good night. -He's not asIeep. Go ahead. I promised your parents to protect your virtue. I'd be more concerned about Maxime's virtue. PauI-Louis! Keep your ears open in case I caII for heIp. UtterIy sweet. Your turn, Renee. I've gained weight. -You eat too much. -Too much comfort. I'm rich, happy, inteIIigent.... -It's too much, isn't it? -AbsoIuteIy. Can I come in? Yes. I'm going to pIay you a fantastic record, kids. PIease Iisten with rapt attention. HonestIy, I have to turn in. Sernet wouId say: ''Take advantage, but don't exaggerate.'' SiIence. Obey! Tyrant. WiII you sIeep with her tonight? Who are you asking? -You've sIept with her? -No. Swear it. I swear. You swear.... You'd swear to anything. Why have you avoided me aII week? Why do you make sure we're never aIone? It's coincidence. WiII you coincidentaIIy meet her in her room tonight? -I'm not going to meet her. -Liar! Don't Iock your door. I'II be back Iater. No. You're sIeeping in Saccard's room. I'II find a way. I'II say I have insomnia and sIeep in the Iiving room. Sure! Saccard wiII have insomnia, too. He won't be abIe to find you and he'II get worried. -ScandaI. -So what? Fine! I don't care if there's a scandaI. -Do you hear me? -Are you crazy? -I don't want to sIeep with your father. -Liar! -Why do you caII me a Iiar? -It's going weII with my father, it seems. -What do you mean? -You and Saccard have worked things out. That's it. That's not true. Who toId you that? My father. I was afraid. I was afraid he'd find out. You stiII Iove me a bit? I Iove you a Iot. You know it. -Do you Iove me? -Yes. Are you happy now? But you're running away from me. I know you are. Why? Because of my father! You're used to deceiving him. I'm not. That's how it is. You're right. Maxime, Iet's go away. Anywhere. Wherever you want. Let's go! Sure.... Kidnap my father's wife. I can't do that. Can't you understand that? -And if I weren't his wife? -What? If I weren't Saccard's wife anymore? If Negroes were white, we'd have no more bIack probIem. If I weren't his wife, wouId you Ieave with me? Of course. You went for a waIk? I'm thirsty. Aren't you coming to bed? I'm tired. You can read if you Iike. I don't mind. I want a divorce, AIexandre. Are you serious? Yes. Are you bored? Are you in Iove? I want a divorce. You must have a reason. I want a divorce and nothing wiII stop me. If I decide to, I wiII. Do you refuse? I haven't decided yet. Pass me my robe, pIease. Once you're divorced, what money are you going to Iive on? My own money. I'm rich. You're rich as Iong as you're Mrs. Saccard. I don't understand. You must have reasons... your own reasons to get divorced. But honestIy, it's not in your interest. I don't care about my interest. I'II be very frank with you.... I invested your fortune in my business. Your entire fortune. I can't give it back to you right now. My business is Iike a pyramid. Remove one stone, the whoIe thing coIIapses. -You've no right! That's steaIing! -Take it easy. No big words. I have a better head for business than you. You'II get your money back in doubIe, or tripIe, one day. My onIy mistake was to think we'd be married forever. When can you give it back? I don't know exactIy. In two or three years. That's impossibIe. I need that money! -It's my right to ask for it! -AbsoIuteIy... but it wouId onIy ruin us. We'II be singing at sidewaIk cafes whiIe Maxime passes the hat. You may not care about your own interests or mine... but don't forget about Maxime. What about the divorce? ReIinquish the assets I've invested. You'II have the divorce... and a reasonabIe aIimony. That's bIackmaiI! I'm not asking you for anything. You're the one who's in a hurry. I'm not even asking you to decide tonight. Take your time. A day, a month... ten years. I've made a decision. I accept the divorce on your terms. Fine. When can we settIe it? When you wish. Today. In switzerland, you'll meet Judge Dorfman. It is understood that Mr. saccard will retain your contribution. Mr. saccard agrees to be responsible for the contribution. -Except in case of bankruptcy. -Of course, Mr. saccard. You will present this to the presiding judge in Geneva. You will sign a statement granting him permission to manage your fortune. -It is understood-- -That I'II sign? Yes. The judge wiII consider these papers to be officiaI. -WiII it take Iong? -One week, ma'am. No more than five or six days. Why Geneva? Can't I sign them here? Your marriage was registered in Geneva. The Swiss Iaw is cIear: ''For a marriage''-- -There's no other way. -I'II go. I'II Ieave tonight. Watch it. The guys.... Be carefuI. Where did you come from? Oh, shit. They pIay rough. You're as beautifuI as ever. Where did you come from? Be carefuI, I toId you. We don't have to anymore. I'm getting divorced. I'm not Saccard's wife anymore. I'm Ieaving tonight for Geneva, to finaIize it. It's over, Maxime. It's over! I'm so happy! Now we can kiss wherever we Iike! I don't beIieve it. I'm not Saccard's wife anymore. Did you taIk to him? I asked him for a divorce. -He agreed? -Yes. -Did he ask you why? -No. I'm taking the train to Geneva. I'II spend a week there. When I get back, we'II Ieave for Greece. Do you Iike that idea? You'II write your father and teII him everything. To Greece? Do you agree? What if I wait tiII tomorrow? I'II take the first fIight. My bags are in the car. We'II sIeep in a hoteI. I have to go. Fifteen minutes Ieft. Wait for me? -Have the biII ready, pIease. -Yes, ma'am. Do you want me to take you to OrIy? It'd be too sad. By the way, I don't want to go to Greece. Where, then? To CeyIon. To Japan. I'II go anywhere you want. I Iove you. CIose your eyes. I don't want you to watch me go. Stop moving. Count to 1). One, two, three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine.... You didn't sIeep here Iast night. I sIept at a friend's. So you've had breakfast? No. -Want to keep me company? -Sure. You haven't Ieft for the office? No. I was waiting for you. ReaIIy? You haven't seen Renee? She didn't mention anything? Why? What's going on? Renee's divorcing me. ReaIIy? ReaIIy. Did you taIk about it? What is there to taIk about? She insists upon a divorce. The terms are cIear. I hope her true Iove wiII understand her. I hope she'II invite us to her next wedding. -Do you think she'II-- -Of course. I hope he'II be rich... and abIe to provide her with the IifestyIe... -she's accustomed to. -Why? She's rich, isn't she? PenniIess. That's not what she says. AII her money is invested in my business. I thought I'd expIained it to her cIearIy enough... but Renee doesn't understand business. The facts are cIear. By insisting on an immediate divorce, she doesn't get a cent. She's not going to sing at sidewaIk cafes? No. I have every reason to be angry with her... but what good is revenge? She's irresponsibIe. If she marries an artist, I'II give her aIimony. She'II manage, if she's sensibIe. I'm becoming a widow, son. Now I can go gaIIivanting with you from time to time. TeII the girIs your father's singIe. Come to the office with me? -Want me to drop you off? -Yes. -Have cIasses this morning? -Yes. I'II get my books. You're in troubIe, kid. You've got yourseIf in very deep troubIe. Are things that bad? I'm going through a rough patch. If I get through it... you won't have to worry about my oId age or about yours, either. If I don't, I Iose aII my money. A European record. You'II get through it. I hope so. I'II be counting on my friends. I'II need their heIp. -Someone can heIp me. -Who? -You. -Me? Do you Iike Anne? Anne Sernet? Of course. Her father is fond of you. He toId me she Iikes you a Iot, too. I don't think he'd be against your engagement. You want me to get married? An engagement can be drawn out. Right? If I get engaged... you're saved? Yes. So are you. And so is Renee. Anne is beautifuI, isn't she? Can I think about it, boss? Not for too Iong. No. It's impossibIe. I'm sorry, but it's impossibIe. I can't do that. No! I'm yeIIing.... Composure is more impressive. A Iot of composure. Sorry, Dad, but that's how it is. That's the way it is. I won't marry Anne. I won't marry Anne. That's aII. We'II see.... -Dad, Iisten.... -Be poIite. I'm aImost done. -Something to teII me? -Yes. Listen, Dad. Let's respect tradition. I spoke to Anne. She's thriIIed. Listen, I reaIIy think.... You're baiIing me out of a bad situation. A very bad situation. Thank you. Thanks. Listen.... This engagement isn't a IifeIong commitment. Some men never commit to a woman. Look at Renee and I. I'm not used to peopIe doing me favors out of kindness. I've aIways fought aIone. It's nice to have an aIIy. ''How nice,'' as Maxime wouId say. -Listen, Saccard-- -Renee once said... that you thought I was wonderfuI. ''That guy is wonderfuI.'' You know, you're not bad yourseIf. When a guy's reaIIy in a bind.... Let's drink to famiIy. What? You speak Chinese, I speak Spanish. It means: HeaIth, Iove and new francs. What does that mean? It's untransIatabIe. When's the engagement? We'II announce it pubIicIy in a few days. At my Green BaII. WeII done. Nice goaI, Dad. Right between the posts. WeII done. I have a gift for you. A trip to Japan, for you and Anne. To Japan? Do I have to thank you? No. Mrs. Saccard, a caII from Paris. Thank you. GiIberte? How did you find me? Yes. Of course I know about the baII. What news? No, I'm not pIaying dumb. Anne and Maxime's engagement? Yes. PIease aIIow me to interrupt... this marveIous and very important evening. I hereby announce the engagement of Miss Anne Sernet... and my son, Maxime. Don't cause a scandaI. Come on. Did you hear me? Did you hear me? -What are you disguised as, my dear? -It's a wig. Leave me aIone. Stop. Sit down. Wait here. We can't be Iate. You know Maxime doesn't Iike to wait. I know. Stay caIm. Just stay caIm. I'II heIp you. THE END
